[00:00:30] <TimMc> I was hoping for euros!

[00:00:40] <GuiToris> GBP is worthier
[00:01:04] <Prutz> Mutti bumsen ja
[00:01:07] <GuiToris> that's why England sailed away

[00:02:32] <GuiToris> now they are approaching America. 1cm each year !Brace yourself!
[00:02:42] <blkshp> And we never did accept the Euro. Last time i was in Deutschland they still used Deutschmarks.

[00:03:20] <Prutz> europe changed into euro currency
[00:03:29] <blkshp> Some of Europe!
[00:03:41] <Prutz> well most ;)
[00:04:05] <GuiToris> every country in the euro-zone :D
[00:04:11] <GuiToris> that's 100%

[00:04:50] <Prutz> euro coin has advantages... otherwise i had laying shit load of different currencies

[00:13:32] <GuiToris> it's always on the right side, if you cannot find it on the left side

[00:14:50] <GuiToris> not many people know this
[00:15:10] <blkshp> Was it an Oldsmobile 442 with a 3000 Cubic inch Engile, radial tyres and bucket seats?
[00:15:33] <Prutz> my old Corolla has it on the left yes but my GF Daihatsu (which is kind ofToyota) has it on the right side
[00:15:56] <blkshp> My first car was a Corolla, i don't remember where the tank was
[00:16:31] <mdogg> GuiToris: The logo that shows which side your filler cap is really doesn't need to be looked at more than once.  I just found it interesting that the Germans decided to make it a rule to *always* place it on the right.

[00:17:38] <GuiToris> my girlfriend used to use a lot of different cars and we didn't know where the gas tank was
[00:17:52] <GuiToris> and the indicator was helpful, once we learned about it
[00:17:58] <blkshp> the 3000 was the word in the quote i couldn't quite remember. I may have added a 0
[00:18:11] <mdogg> GuiToris: Oh for rental cars and stuff like that - yeah.  
[00:18:18] <Prutz> tank indicator started early 2000's i think?
[00:18:30] <Prutz> my 1999 Corolla doesn't has it
[00:18:41] <mdogg> Well, 442 would be the cubic inches on a 442.

[00:32:10] <mdogg> Honestly, any car that works is a great first car.  I don't know anyone who hated their first car.
[00:32:44] <Prutz> To be honest... when I see this ad I almost want to pick it up
[00:33:17] <mdogg> I probably only got about 90hp from a 330 V-8.  The Americans seem to have trouble getting horsepower and torque out of engines.
[00:35:03] <Prutz> My mother bought it back in the day. Then she passed away and I inherited the car when i was 15.  When I got 18 I got to drive to car but when the car was rotten I had to bring it to the scrapheap..  That hurted a lot. 
[00:35:35] <Prutz> oh wow 90hp for such a big engine?
[00:36:01] <mdogg> That's the American way.

[01:50:46] <GuiToris> the book says 1.png is building blocks, and 2. is building bricks

[12:49:54] <pussipupu> I think it dealt with radians to be fair, but I wasn't being entirely serious
[12:49:56] <pycode> or should it mean a list of sales
[12:50:01] <pycode> ?
[12:50:14] <pussipupu> If it's a lot of quotes that would be a pile of paper then it could
[12:52:45] <pycode> pussipupu, yes i mean...could it be list "i very big list of sales i made" ?

[13:29:44] <Nobrem> hi
[13:29:52] <Nobrem> is a "strange person"  the same as a "stranger"?
[13:30:00] <Nobrem> or is a "strange person"  a weird person?
[13:31:03] <twb> Nobrem: no
[13:31:12] <twb> "strange person" is behaving oddly
[13:31:23] <twb> "stranger" is a person you have not met
[13:32:04] <twb> I suppose the "not met" sense could be used for something like "this person is strange to me" but it's definitely not the obvious sense
[13:32:06] <Nobrem> twb, so, my initial gut feeling was right.  
[13:32:18] <Nobrem> twb, there is this youtube video ... I can show it to you with a time stamp
[13:32:19] <Nobrem> brb
[13:33:53] <Nobrem> twb, here is the full sentence:
[13:33:55] <Nobrem> >> "Listen, I didn't bust my ass for all those years for my son to serve strange people food for loose change."
[13:34:46] <Nobrem> twb, the speakers are definitely native speakers (AE) and this is what the father said to his son when he found out he was a waiter at a restaurant
[13:35:14] <Nobrem> twb, the wording "strange people" is what tripped me up here
[13:35:18] <twb> Nobrem: I think they mean strangers as in "not family members"
[13:35:26] <twb> but it's a bit odd in my mind
[13:35:39] <Nobrem> I thought so, too
[13:35:41] <Nobrem> thank you

[20:17:34] <Bayes> well you didn't want to take classes because those classes would get you closer to classical music

[22:46:13] * tinwhiskers assumes it was an attempt at humour of some kind.
[22:50:02] * blkshp is unable to determine it :P
[22:50:20] * blkshp gives tinwhiskers a plate of cauliflower cheese with a large steak
[22:50:30] <tinwhiskers> yum

[22:52:40] <tinwhiskers> mostly trolling. noted.
[22:52:48] * blkshp adds to list
[22:52:53] <pussipupu> How much mustard is in the cauliflower cheese?
[22:53:10] <blkshp> none, it's made with blue cheese.
[22:53:19] <tinwhiskers> valid
[22:53:30] <tinwhiskers> also yum
[22:54:11] <blkshp> :)
[22:55:44] <pussipupu> acceptable
[22:55:50] <pussipupu> though I'd still add a little

[22:59:33] <tinwhiskers> *flour
[22:59:35] <LimeOn> for wat
[22:59:42] <tinwhiskers> is that ground mustard seed?
[23:00:04] <blkshp> It's what we mix with water to make mustarf.
[23:00:06] <blkshp> mustard*
[23:00:20] <tinwhiskers> oh. ok. 
[23:01:07] <tinwhiskers> I think we'd call that mustard powder
[23:01:35] <blkshp> I also call it mustard powder and to be honest i'm merely presuming that's what pussipupu meant.
[23:01:48] <blkshp> It may mean something else that I'm unaware of
[23:02:35] <pussipupu> yes it's mustard seed in flour form
[23:02:45] <blkshp> DO not get it in your eye.
[23:03:19] <pussipupu> or snort a line of it to be fair
[23:03:25] <tinwhiskers> wild
[23:03:39] <blkshp> I've snorted vinegar and HP sauce.
[23:03:50] <blkshp> I don't recommend it.

[23:51:59] <FLHerne> The second one is unambiguous, but "I also" is a bit dated
[23:52:17] <FLHerne> The first one could mean either depending on context
[23:52:27] <blkshp> I do not concur.
[23:52:32] <FLHerne> by default I'd assume you meant the same as the second

[23:52:49] <blkshp> I also like I also.
[23:54:33] <FLHerne> You could equally well say "I too have always wanted to do it that way"
[23:54:49] <blkshp> YES!
[23:54:52] <blkshp> lovely sentence.
[23:54:52] <FLHerne> which would have the same unambiguous meaning
[23:55:00] <FLHerne> and sounds nicer to me
