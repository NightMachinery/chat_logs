[00:12:00] <PJBoy> idk
[00:12:10] <PJBoy> modules aren't necessarily hard to port old code too
[00:12:38] <PJBoy> they are at the moment, because VS has terrible error handling for modules misusage
[00:12:44] <PJBoy> and because other compilers aren't there yet
[00:14:15] <PJBoy> you can start by making header files that import your modules, and continue using #include
[00:14:32] <PJBoy> and then slowly migrate code from the headers into the modules
[00:14:45] <PJBoy> eventually you might be able to replace those headers entirely

[00:36:16] <PJBoy> it can deduce size
[00:36:42] <rpav> probably not the way i need
[00:37:10] <rpav> oh, you need to not specify _any_ parameters .. which is fine

[00:37:40] <PJBoy> or use std::to_array if you really want to specify the type

[00:38:11] <PJBoy> well that de-escalated quickly

[12:32:47] <vdamewood> bobb_: You may have built C, but you didn't tell ${LIBS} to link with it.
[12:33:28] <vdamewood> err ${LIB}
[12:34:21] <bobb_> vdamewood what you say sounds reasonable but can you tell me why it makes a difference to call add_library inside the loop on the raw source files is different to an explicit add_library call in a dedicated CMakeLists.txt?
[12:37:08] <TinoDidriksen> Looks like your paste isn't a paste, 'cause it's wrong. What is your actual foreach loop?
[12:37:28] <vdamewood> bobb_: Oh, It looked like you were linking them all as a single thing.
[12:37:33] <vdamewood> This expands to nothing: ${${LIBS}_SOURCES}
[12:37:51] <vdamewood> (No sources, no linker errors because you have no unresolved symbols)
[12:37:56] <bobb_> (maybe i was a bit unprecise, the ugly gobb stuff is working but as soon as i split out one directory and add a CMakeLists.txt that just contains add_library(C STATIC first.cpp second.cpp whatever.c... ) i receive undefined symbols
[12:38:10] <TinoDidriksen> Indeed, the GLOB loop is doing nothing atm.
[12:38:37] <bobb_> TinoDidriksen sorry, let me check this again
[12:39:00] <TinoDidriksen> Also, you shouldn't use GLOB for this in the first place. It's explicitly discouraged by CMake docs.
[12:39:39] <bobb_> TinoDidriksen Its a legacy project i try to clean up
[12:39:43] <vdamewood> GLOBs can't be read at make/ninja/build time. So if you change any sources, they won't be added/removed from the files.
[12:39:43] <bobb_> remove ALL the globs

[12:40:04] <bobb_> i'm fully aware about that
[12:40:40] <bobb_> what i try to do is to get rid of all globs there
[12:42:20] <vdamewood> Well, like we said, what you have there doesn't do anything anyway.
[12:42:57] <vdamewood> Well, maybe it makes 3 empty libraries.
[12:46:50] <bobb_> vdamewood TinoDidriksen i oversaw a list command: https://wandbox.org/permlink/bl1enFzLm0w5BEZq
[12:47:37] <bobb_> argh sorry, its still incorrect
[12:47:53] <TinoDidriksen> Don't annotate. Just copy-paste what's actually there.
[12:48:03] <vdamewood> Like I said, ${${LIBS}_SOURCES} expands to nothing.

[16:25:02] <TinoDidriksen> Also, git commit refs suck. You kinda need the date or you won't know what's newer or older, so blame format needs that baggage. I just want the commit ref and the absolute number of that commit.
[16:32:18] <PJBoy> yeah I'll take revision numbers over meaningless hashes all day long
[16:32:20] <cbreak> you can't have absolute numbers with branches. You could have unix time stamps instead though? :)
[16:32:36] <PJBoy> whatever advantages hashes have aren't worth it
[16:33:02] <cbreak> they are worth it, it's basically required for one of the key requirements of git, its distributedness

[17:28:12] <cbreak> there isn't really a main branch
[17:28:37] <PJBoy> the branch created when you create the repo?
[17:28:40] <cbreak> in many repos there's one, but in many others there are several
[17:28:51] <cbreak> like one branch per release that's maintained
[17:29:05] <cbreak> one for preparing the next release
[17:29:07] <PJBoy> they're all branched from the original branch though, right?
[17:29:09] <cbreak> and a few dozen for new features
[17:29:15] <cbreak> depends
[17:29:25] <cbreak> it's possible to start new roots
[17:29:30] <cbreak> I do that for rewrites
[17:29:36] <PJBoy> oh really?
[17:29:43] <cbreak> git checkout --orphan
[17:29:46] <PJBoy> that's a TIL if so
[17:30:01] <cbreak> an other way is to just merge two independent repos
[17:30:22] <PJBoy> actually I've heard of orphaned nodes before
[17:30:25] <TinoDidriksen> Orphan branches are quite useful.
[17:30:28] <cbreak> this is often done for subtree merging (to merge a repository with some dependency into your repo)
[17:30:32] <PJBoy> that happens for rebases, right?
[17:30:37] <cbreak> that's something else
[17:30:45] <PJBoy> and then you place them into history at some point
[17:30:57] <cbreak> PJBoy: rebasing (and other history rewriting) can leave behind disconnected history, which will be garbage collected
[17:31:04] <PJBoy> ah ok
[17:31:19] <PJBoy> alright well orphan branches throw a spanner in my works
[17:31:20] <cbreak> if you use git checkout --orphan, you create a new branch without connected history
[17:31:30] <cbreak> the first commit in it will be an orphan commit. A commit... without parents

[22:18:01] <rpav> why i didn't think of using __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ to get enum names .. so facepalm
[22:18:14] <PJBoy> too much sanity?
[22:18:22] <rpav> what other interesting stuff can you capture i wonder
[22:19:07] <rpav> can't get variable names from the calling code i think, unfortunately
[22:20:26] <PJBoy> the same function can be called from multiple places, so definitely not at compile time
[22:21:02] <rpav> yeah i think the only way to get variable names is still preprocessor token quoting/pasting

[22:25:11] <PJBoy> although there is C++23 std::stacktrace
[22:25:54] <PJBoy> idk if it'll give anything rich and useful
[22:26:15] <PJBoy> but it has .source_line() at least
[22:26:26] <PJBoy> likely requiring debug symbols
[22:26:39] <PJBoy> oh that just gets the line number, nvm
[22:27:07] <PJBoy> and it's not declared [[nodiscard]] smh
[22:28:48] <kalven> is vector::begin nodiscard?
[22:29:28] <PJBoy> it's not smh
[22:29:30] <rpav> nodiscard should only be used if discarding it is basically an error :p
[22:29:44] <rpav> like, vector.begin() is useless but not an _error_
[22:29:49] <BurumaSerafuku> why would you call .begin() w/o getting its value?
[22:29:52] <PJBoy> these are pure functions
[22:29:54] <BurumaSerafuku> it should be nodiscard, I guess
[22:29:57] <kalven> smh
[22:30:15] <rpav> ðŸŽ»

[22:30:17] <nolyc> BurumaSerafuku: Error: "smh" is not a valid command.
[22:30:57] <PJBoy> maybe they're doing the constexpr thing
[22:31:05] <PJBoy> where they always wait a paper or two before adding it
[22:31:09] <kalven> had this been thought of from the start, then it'd have been [[discard]] instead

[23:23:13] <ashafq> do you have to write a different deleter for that?

[23:24:17] <ashafq> Alipha: it will be for POD types like int or float
[23:24:37] <Alipha> You dynamically allocated an array of pointers and each of those pointers point to dynamically allocated arrays of Ts?
[23:24:55] <ashafq> And as for deleting, I only need to delete the first element T[0], which should be the head of the pointer
[23:25:57] <ashafq> I compute the total size and then allocate the total bytes in one
