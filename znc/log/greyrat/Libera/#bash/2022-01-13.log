[00:02:53] <deadmund> what is printf %q   vs printf %q\n    vs printf %q\\n   ?
[00:03:34] <Soliton> !tias
[00:03:34] <greybot> Try It And See
[00:05:06] <deadmund> I see, should be printf %\\n   so there is a newline after printing.

[00:05:57] <deadmund> I am getting a really strange result on the $soln string that I hard-coded in the script.  It seems that every space is some sort of special character space?
[00:05:57] <twkm> depends if you want a newline.
[00:06:03] <deadmund> Enter\ bloodstain\ wi
[00:06:16] <twkm> likely you failed to quote the expansion.
[00:06:46] <twkm> \  is %q's way of telling you that there was a space in the data.
[00:06:47] <deadmund> Why are all the spaces preceeded by a "\"   ?  The $result does not have the spaces preceeded by "\"
[00:07:17] <twkm> use %s if you don't want special characters shown quoted.

[00:08:39] <tirnanog> it's a valid way of quoting spaces. just not one that you find aesthetically pleasing.

[00:10:22] <deadmund> Why does $soln have \'s and $result does not despite them both being printed with the same printf $q\\n  ??
[00:10:31] <twkm> i told you.  sheesh.
[00:10:33] <emanuele6> soln has got a literal \n where result has a newline
[00:10:35] <Soliton> one has a newline and the other a backslash followed by an n.
[00:11:28] <Soliton> if you want an actual newline in soln then use $'' instead.

[00:11:32] <greybot> bash has a special form of quoting, $'string' in which backslash-character combinations are expanded. For example, IFS=$' \t\n' or echo $'It\'s embedded!' http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes

[06:00:48] <Blondie101010> reading that makes me wonder if it might be worth it to actually make a reusable parameter parsing function
[06:01:15] <Blondie101010> since everything is in the global scope by default in bash, it should be fairly easy to do
[06:02:24] <omegatron> it has already been done
[06:02:37] <Blondie101010> then I'd put it in the factoid
[06:02:53] <omegatron> I think it's somewhere on one of the linked sites
[06:04:33] <Blondie101010> you didn't read the page
[06:04:52] <omegatron> I did - months ago the last time
[06:05:05] <omegatron> don't expect me to remember the verbatim content
[06:05:38] <Blondie101010> it does provide lots of code which could be used in what I was talking about, but no simple prepared solution which I think could be useful
[06:05:45] <omegatron> but .. I prefer a simple case/esac-block to fetch program/function parameters - it's straightforward
[06:06:07] <Blondie101010> it is the cleanest explic solution

[06:08:15] *** Joins: bluedust (~bluedust@185.195.232.135)
[06:08:23] <omegatron> and I don't use that silly '-' or '--' approach
[06:08:49] <Blondie101010> that's besides the point
[06:09:00] <omegatron> just a side note ..
[06:09:11] <Blondie101010> the intent is not to focus on YOUR use and interests, but the general public
[06:09:35] <Blondie101010> and that's actually my point in providing a simple consistent solution
[06:10:01] <omegatron> oh - you were talking about "I think of writing a software, which does that thing and put it on github et al."  - well just say so
[06:10:34] <omegatron> until now I assumed you were only talking about your own software for your own stuff
[06:11:02] <omegatron> but maybe I missed that part somewhere above
[06:11:23] <Blondie101010> I said that I was wondering if it might be worth it...  not hard to write, so I'll probably play with the idea on the weekend
[06:12:02] <Blondie101010> but doing that implies the next release and the other after
[06:12:16] <Blondie101010> or no one uses it
[06:12:51] <omegatron> yea - and to spare you the time: it has already been done some months ago and was put one of those pages (I think) - maybe tomorrow, when the author is in the channel around, you might ask again and someone can tell you the url

[06:33:45] <Edu4rdSHL> Hello, I'm trying to create a program which accepts arguments and I have created 2 possible ooptions to manage the arguments: 1) https://paste.rs/kKX 2) https://paste.rs/eoC, however the problem that I have with both of the implementations is that, for example, if I use -n after -i the value is not assigned to the variable but it works if I use -n and then -i
[06:33:50] <earendel> last time i tried i realized the one thing that's preventing to have a generic parser is you can't decide if a parameter is just a switch or if it's expected to have value. (in particular when the last parameter is a switch, so the following value doesn't start with a - )
[06:33:58] <Edu4rdSHL> Is that how it's supposed to work?
[06:34:55] <Edu4rdSHL> ./program -n name -i # value of -n is assigned to OUTPUT_NAME
[06:35:05] <Edu4rdSHL> ./program -i -n name # value of -n is NOT assigned to OUTPUT_NAME
[06:36:44] *** Joins: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher)
[06:37:49] <earendel> a non-generic solution could be to require all parameter values to be assigned with = .. then the rest would be all switches

[07:35:01] <leftyfb> I don't see how this helps me. What I'm doing is looping through a bunch of strings and want to set a status with the string as the variable name so when I come back around later I can check the status of the string name

[11:05:41] <gerj79> e36freak, the last one gives a blank output.
[11:05:54] <gerj79> I think I tried the first one before, but didnt work
[11:06:23] <akoana> gerj79: what kind of file is that, a text file?
[11:06:40] <gerj79> akoana, it is an odt file
[11:06:42] <gerj79> libre office
[11:06:59] <gerj79> with a hyperlinked text in each row
[11:07:04] <gerj79> and some rows are duplicate
[11:07:41] <akoana> awk expects a text file, not a gzipped xml file like an .odt file
[11:07:46] <gerj79> if they were just texts without link, it would be easy, but with links it gets messy every time
[11:08:15] <gerj79> akoana, I need a format which retains the links
[11:08:41] <gerj79> would html work?
[11:09:10] <akoana> gerj79: the odt file is a binary format, awk won't work for that, save it to a text file
[11:10:13] <akoana> and let's hope its content will be something parseable for awk...
[11:10:19] <gerj79> I might have found an alternative; while I was trying, I managed to remove the duplicates, but then could not get a full solution because all rows became space-delimited, moved next to each other
[11:10:50] <gerj79> if you can tell me how I can convert space-delimited (hyperlinked) texts into rows again, I may have solved it
[11:12:15] <gerj79> so it is like "textlink1 textlink2 textlink3..." currently. I need each of these as a separate row
[11:12:40] <akoana> how did you get that "textlink1 textlink2 textlink3..."?

[16:16:30] <Blondie101010> I'd disagree and suggest focusing on errors first
[16:16:51] <Guest21> Thank you diph and chiselfuse . Following lopid 's advice I have been able to read in the CLI  a very long  answer to a "tree | less" command. And I got distracted trying to copy and paste that very long answer to Geany (the IDE I usually use as a text editor) . That is why I didn't thank you before.
[16:17:03] *** Joins: WinterStar (~IceLight@user/icelight)
[16:17:15] <chiselfuse> Blondie101010: what do you mean?
[16:17:38] <Blondie101010> stdout and stderr are separate, and he likely wants a clean output
[16:17:40] <chiselfuse> Guest21: don't copy paste, instead, you can do    tree 2>&1 > output.txt
[16:17:55] <Blondie101010> if errors show up, then it will be a messed up output
[16:18:05] <chiselfuse> or if you don't want errors like Blondie101010 suggests, then do    tree > output.txt
[16:18:11] <Blondie101010> but sure showing proper redirects is good
[16:18:41] <chiselfuse> Guest21: that will put the output of the command to a file called output.txt
[16:19:26] <chiselfuse> and to see where that file has been output, do: pwd    to see which directory (folder) you are in
[16:19:29] <Blondie101010> and errors on screen
[16:20:10] <chiselfuse> yes, if you want these errors you see in the screen to be in the file too, you would use the 2>&1
[16:20:17] <sixwheeledbeast> Yer don't use a terminal pager for that redirect to file.

[16:27:12] <Guest21> As  said at 12:04:09 UTC: after about a decade of using GNU/Linux operating systems I have learned the name of some commands and very occasionally use them. So everything you have said after my first post is prompting me to test your suggestions and I thank you very much for that. I hope that some (or all) of them will help me to solve the
[16:27:12] <Guest21> problem of reading the whole long output of the "tree" command  in a .txt file. Thanks to you all.

[19:01:48] <tirnanog> that question doesn't seem to be connected to the first.
[19:02:10] <beuys> tirnanog: I don't want to pollute the rest of the execution with the variable $username.
[19:02:12] <phy1729> also "$username" isn't quoted
[19:02:14] <beuys> But maybe it does not matter.
[19:02:17] <phy1729> For that you can use local
[19:02:22] <phy1729> !local
[19:02:22] <greybot> local [option] name[=value]. Same as using declare in a function. Define a variable as local to restrict to a function and the function's children. Good practice to prevent littering your global scope with temp vars. Less impact in an isolated script.
[19:02:28] <tirnanog> beuys: merely assigning to a variable doesn't export it.
[19:02:39] <greycat> The script is a separate process.  Any variables you set inside a script are gone when the script exits.  They don't affect your interactive shells.
[19:02:42] <phy1729> tirnanog: it does set it globally for the script though

[19:03:13] <beuys> Ok .. yeah, maybe it is not a problem if $username is set globally for the script.

[20:34:46] <cousteau> I just saw a file using a heredoc like ``... << \!``.  Is there any reason someone would use ! as the end-of-heredoc mark?  Or just because it looks "weird enough"?
[20:34:48] <greycat> Yeah, that's a fucking disaster.
[20:35:33] <greycat> cousteau: you can use any string you like, but ideally you will choose one that can't appear in the document
[20:35:56] <gerj79> as can be seen in the paste, even if the web link is the same in different lines, their date added and modified are different. so there are no duplicates even if the links are the same

[20:58:19] <gerj79> e36freak, I would like to duplicate links and keep the rest. but since every line in the above example paste contains different data like "added date" or "modified date", a line doesnt count as "duplicate" of another even if the links contained are the same

[21:01:35] <earendel> hehe. loosers.
[21:02:11] <cousteau> So, while <<\X requires you to use exactly \X as a terminator (in csh, not in sh), <<\! becomes simply <<!
[21:02:58] <cousteau> And therefore ! is a valid terminator for that block in both sh and csh (only, in csh it'll substitute variables)
[21:03:37] <e36freak> gerj79: then the normal awk to remove duplicate lines should work fine? if the whole line needs to be the same

[21:59:28] <uuidNuni1> but 0-100.com may not always in there. so the safe keyword would be ^00 or ^000

[23:32:21] <Filystyn> I just want to scan subdomains to check if they are.  Maybe? Not covered by cloudflare
[23:32:32] <Filystyn> But I can manage on my own now
[23:32:42] *** Quits: pell15533 (~pelle@83-94-28-36-cable.dk.customer.tdc.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:33:02] <uuidNuni1> question: compare the subdomain with what list?
[23:33:30] <Filystyn> I don't compare, I have the list and want it to be in script so I can always edit
[23:33:36] <Filystyn> I use every of each
[23:33:51] <uuidNuni1> Filystyn: you have a solution, but if i were you, always want a better one simpler one portable one
[23:33:55] *** Joins: andril (~andril@c-66-229-99-96.hsd1.fl.comcast.net)
[23:34:22] <Filystyn> I assume that if it works here it works eveyrwhere
[23:35:08] <uuidNuni1> you have the list , and how are you going to use the list, for what? say it

[23:36:48] <uuidNuni1> Filystyn: i don't get it, you want the list in the script? then build an array
[23:37:10] <uuidNuni1> list=(d1.cf.com d2.cf.com ....)
[23:37:54] *** Joins: Guest2198 (~Guest21@181.199.144.229)

[23:39:02] <Filystyn> I will do host "$subdomian"."$domain"
[23:39:45] <Filystyn> and save all resoults
[23:39:46] <uuidNuni1> to get the ip addr of the domain? and then, what would you do to the ip addr?
[23:40:06] <Filystyn> sort uniq the ips
[23:40:31] <Filystyn> perhaps no cloudflare ip in sight
[23:40:44] <Filystyn> fin
[23:42:03] <Filystyn> well tor-resolv instead of host but you get the idea

[23:44:02] <uuidNuni1> then you need only an array sub=(sub1 sub2 sub3 ...) and then an array ips=() , then for i in "${sub[@]}" ; do ips+=( $(host ${i}.cloudflare.com) ) ; done

[23:46:36] <Filystyn> is that question directed to me?
[23:46:42] <Filystyn> emanuele?
[23:47:41] <lopid> that's a personal question

[23:48:38] <emanuele6> uuidNuni1: mapfile -t -O "${#ips[@]}" ips < <(host "$i.cloudflare.com")
[23:48:45] <greycat> uuidNuni1: your answers would be over-complicated even if thie person were using bash, but they're asking for sh, so your answers are both over-complicated *and* non-working

[23:49:51] <greycat> Sadly, we never did get a comprehensible problem statement.
[23:50:24] <greycat> All we know is they're using sh, they have a known static list of ... something.  And they want to do DNS lookups.
[23:50:36] <uuidNuni1> phy1729: why do you print my pre nick?
[23:50:36] <Filystyn> the problem was solved, granted help good, yet I keep getting asked.
[23:50:55] <Filystyn> And some strange statements are being made

[23:56:09] * uuidNuni1 cry. how can i live without array and $()
[23:56:25] <greycat> it has $() which is COMMAND substitution

[23:57:37] <greycat> ah, emanuele6 did
[23:57:55] <uuidNuni1> in bash <() generates a file?
[23:58:06] <geirha> sort-of
[23:58:18] <emanuele6> a file, not a regular file
[23:58:20] <greycat> it *might* create a named pipe on some platforms, but probably not any platform you use
