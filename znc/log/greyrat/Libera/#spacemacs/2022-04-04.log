[03:01:33] <FromGitter> <jqmtor> Hey everyone, I am setting up the Scala layer and I‚Äôve been having some trouble with it. I cannot make spacemacs identify that I have a LSP server installed for Scala (metals) and when I try to open a Scala file, it asks me whether I want to install it automatically. The instructions of the layer specifically mention to install metals manually and make sure it is in the path, which I did. The puzzling thing is 
[03:01:33] <FromGitter> ... that evaluating `(getenv ‚ÄúPATH‚Äù)` shows that `/usr/local/bin` is in there (which is where the layer instructions install metals. Additionally, running `(executable-find ‚Äúmetals-emacs‚Äù)` returns the path of the executable as expected. Did anyone have this problem before?

[23:41:00] <FromGitter> <rappie> hehe ok i'll take a look at it :) thanks
[23:51:21] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @mcp292 I don't know about any such vairable, but I guess this is considered a bug. As far as I know, generally all things where evil behaves different from vim are considered to be bugs. So I guess you should report it upstream...
