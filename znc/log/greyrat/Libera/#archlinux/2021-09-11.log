[01:02:48] <unixquuw> Hello arch peeps, how can i get my two monitors to work on arch? The main one that is plugged to my nvidia video card works fine, but the second one plugged to the processor isn't.
[01:03:23] <qin> try plugging both of them into your nvidia card
[01:03:56] <Flexyjerkov> try not using nvidia ;)
[01:04:06] <unixquuw> qin haha, actually you see, the problem is here that my nvidia card only got one hdmi port, and my cpu got another
[01:04:09] <Betal> newer nvidias don't have vga anymore
[01:04:11] <unixquuw> Flexyjerkov too poor
[01:04:22] <qin> unixquuw: you can get an adapter
[01:04:45] <unixquuw> qin No bro that's not what i mean, i dualboot with windows right? Those two monitors work fine, etc etc
[01:04:48] <Betal> unixquuw: do your DE or nvidia settings show your display?

[01:05:51] <unixquuw> Also, funny enough the monitor is fully black so it's working, but i think i need to tinkier around with the xorg.conf which well, is kinda scary
[01:06:17] <Betal> not sure if xorg is able to autodetect, I need to use custom xorg.conf to detect monitors in my radeon/nvidia (no iGPU)
[01:06:40] <unixquuw> yep, well i guess it's time to xorg.conf

[01:58:29] <bbk> Hey everyone. I hate to be *that* guy but I'm at the end of my wits here. Suddenly my archlinux installation won't boot anymore. It's gets to the GRUB2 screen, it prints 'Loading Linux linux...' and 'Loading initial ramdisk...', then goes black for a few seconds and reboots. Unplugging every perihperal didn't help, and my Win10 partition is able to boot, so I suspect it's not a hardware thing? But I don't 
[01:58:35] <MrElendig> they promised a open vulcan implementation from day one, took years before it actually happened
[01:58:35] <bbk> know what to do anymore. I've been editing the grub params in the hope to get more error messages or anything but to no avail. I would give more information but I have no clue what is relevant here. I wasn't updating/upgrading anything, as far as I can remember I only checked mails and messages program this morning before shutting off for the last time? I know this is not much to work with but any advise 
[01:58:41] <bbk> to help me troubleshoot this would be greatly appreciated, because I don't know where to start.

[05:58:39] <predicament> i sudo most stuff, not everything, but i had to reset the user password but one time i couldn't even login after killing my WM, lightdm
[05:59:33] <predicament> it was really strange.  then the keyring started bitching, i was only able to reset it via GUI, sounds weird but i figured i'd try that if tty wasnt working

[08:22:21] <rcf> Technically they are different things, grub can do quite a bit besides boot Linux 
[08:23:55] <rcf> For permanent use, you'd edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg (if you wrote yours manually) or (if you're using grub-mkconfig) add it to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub and run grub-mkconfig as you did with the initial install.

[08:47:03] <seanicus> rcf: its telling me to find the connector type in the kernel log but its all in binary.  so i just looked at my display configuration, and it's probably just HDMI-1, right?

[12:47:00] <dmc> https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall/issues
[12:47:21] <rabbitnightmare> I dont have github
[12:47:23] <rabbitnightmare> ugh
[12:47:27] <rabbitnightmare> so I will report them here
[12:47:39] <rabbitnightmare> 1) on installation it makes several arch.conf files
[12:47:51] <rabbitnightmare> giving you erronous ones in the boot menu 
[12:48:08] <dmc> rabbitnightmare, 1) check if it's reported 2) if not, give me an issue I can file by proxy
[12:48:11] <rabbitnightmare> 2) no matter what network you choose during installation, it forces you to use iwctl
[12:48:30] <dmc> reporting here will do nothing

[12:54:47] <rabbitnightmare7> "we see that you chose KDE, we should install these packages instead of asking you what you want" would be the far better way
[12:54:52] <demonicmaniac> reporting bugs is good and nice but there's also always just install it yourself

[19:20:02] <mingdao> IDK if anyone has eXPerienced this but me, and it might be something I am doing wrong.  When I install another Linux distro after Arch, the Arch swap partition gets a new UUID which doen't match the one in /etc/fstab, and this adds 1m30s between loading the image and the gdm login screen.

[23:34:12] <thrice> !anyone
[23:34:13] <phrik> Quite possibly. Why do you ask?
[23:35:03] <Bayes> should I run etckeeper init with or without sudo?

[23:37:29] <thrice> Hm, the examples on the wiki start with "#"
[23:37:33] <thrice> which usually implies root
[23:37:43] <Bayes> ah
[23:37:49] <thrice> try it and see?
[23:38:13] <Bayes> yeah I did try and see and got some issues with me not being able to push the files to my github repo

[23:38:37] <Bayes> I didn't know that # means "as root" btw
[23:38:57] *** Joins: ale2183 (~alex@user/ale2183)
[23:39:08] <Bayes> so I read it as "if it's not preappended with sudo, then just run as your own user"
[23:39:17] <HEX0> Bayes: and $ implies non root for future reference
[23:40:33] <thrice> Bayes: it's a wiki, so it could not always be that way, but generally, yeah :)  $ vs. #
[23:41:45] <maztheman> $ = user 
[23:42:37] *** Joins: coc0nut (~coc0nut@user/coc0nut)
[23:43:12] <Bayes> Im following the wiki and as soon as I do sudo etckeeper commit "msg" I get an error: src refspec main does not match any 
[23:43:22] <Bayes> so I feel like im missing something
