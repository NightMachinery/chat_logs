[22:39:47] <ciphrCat> small channel… is this the official channel?
[22:40:26] <ciphrCat> my question is → I want to simply plot a function, but I want certain specific points to be indicated with the "y" value next to them
[22:40:44] <ciphrCat> how can I do that?
[22:41:25] <ciphrCat> i searched through a guide for "point" and "label" and there are so many hits i would basically have to read the whole 250+ pages cover to cover
[22:58:19] <ciphrCat> this is someone asking basically the same question → https://web.archive.org/web/20170222194652/superuser.com/questions/148701/specifically-marking-a-point-in-gnuplot
[22:58:37] <ciphrCat> but the answer at the end doesn't work for me
