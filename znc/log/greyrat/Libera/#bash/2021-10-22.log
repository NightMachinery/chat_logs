[06:00:54] <eschwartz> well no, the difference is the date command accepts the time-to-print as an option-argument -d <date>
[06:00:57] <jensen> I mean when I pass an argument like "$var" after
[06:01:01] <emanuele6> # printf '%s %(%Y-%m-%d_%T)T ' "$BASH"
[06:01:03] <shbot> emanuele6: /bin/bash 2021-10-22_02:31:02
[06:01:05] <eschwartz> printf doesn't let you pass option-arguments to %T
[06:01:10] <eschwartz> %()T
[06:01:12] <emanuele6> if it is at the end it still assumes -1
[06:01:40] <eschwartz> so, it uses a flag value instead
[06:02:58] <emanuele6> you only need to pass -1, if you want to "skip" the %()T

[06:30:33] <jensen> When a script reads from stdin, and I type multi-line text, I need to Ctrl-D multiple times. I believe this is expected behavior--Ctrl-D just sends one line at a time? Would be it a hack to consider ways for user to only Ctrl-D once and/or can this be done without any additional caveats or should one not bother to preserve predictable behavior and just spam Ctrl-D?

[08:46:01] <Feuermagier> no. I exploit a target program. The target expects text, but that's just interpretation. And yes, bufferoverflof throug gets()
[08:46:10] <Blondie101010> ok
[08:47:04] <dermoth> so yes you can doctor your data with xxd - use the normal mode to see hex and ascii side by side, but to read in/write out you need the plain hex mode. It would be easier with a hex eeditor though...

[11:58:13] <rendar> a couple of them
[11:59:21] <m4n> if they are unique, you could use something like sed '/port/s/: \(.*\)$/: new_value/'

[12:18:12] <rendar> pj, the purpose is having a script that automatically install something and sets some default configs

[12:18:43] <Soliton> why does it not install the correct config file to begin with?
[12:18:47] <geirha> Better to just write a complete config file rather than attempting to edit a default
[12:19:01] <pj> rendar: what about placeholders?  you can so edit the file once and put something like "port: {{{PORT}}}" and then it's easy to use sed to replace "{{{PORT}}}" with "1234"
[12:19:05] <rendar> Soliton, huh? the config is correct, i just want to edit default options

[12:26:29] <geirha> a template file would make sense for that

[13:07:31] <Soliton> arash: that is how it already works.
[13:08:26] <Soliton> arash: btw, you should check that cd worked.
[13:08:31] <arash> fine. then it wait for the output before goes to next line? I didn't know
[13:09:09] <Soliton> unless you explicitely run commands in the background everything runs in the foreground. one command after the other.
[13:09:37] <arash> Soliton, is there any better option for that cd part? I want to have files in that folder
[13:09:47] <Soliton> !cd

[13:10:02] <Soliton> just check it worked.
[13:10:53] <Soliton> i guess personally i'd just redirect to the absolute path though.
[13:11:13] <Soliton> so in this case indeed i'd not cd at all.
[13:12:00] <arash> i see. but cd "/home/backup" || exit; is the good replace for what i wrote. is that right?

[20:30:17] <greybot> Quotes expanding in math contexts is a bash-specific feature. If you must use substitutions in a math context (e.g. you need to do maths on $?, $# or ${#var}) and you are targeting POSIX sh, you should not quote those substitutions since the quotes are not guaranteed to expand: e.g. `echo "$(( "$#" + 1 ))"' causes a syntax error in dash and zsh; use `echo "$(( $# + 1 ))"' instead.
[20:30:22] <Blondie101010> probably force of habit to put variables in quotes
[20:30:30] <omegatron> because I quote almost everything, for the sake of readability (and my editor's color syntax settings)

[20:30:49] <omegatron> just a habit - it doesn't make things worse
