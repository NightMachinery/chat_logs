[00:57:45] <apotheon> "Oh, you know, you, um, are a member of a guild, so you can have a scene where a guild contat gives you a quest."
[00:57:53] <apotheon> s/contat/contact/
[00:58:01] <apotheon> There is no "guild" in fantasy, generally speaking.
[00:58:28] <apotheon> . . . unless you're reading a novel where the guild is like a supercharged version of everything wrong with medieval guilds.
[00:58:39] <KillerWasp> Of course, to receive quests you first have to sign up as a member of the guild.

[00:59:50] <nomagno> You're proposing a valid scenario for the former, not the latter
[01:00:28] <KillerWasp> nomagno: yes, +/-, a real freelancing alternative, that's not freelancing, and it's real quest with real profit.
[01:01:10] <nomagno> A guild in the medieval fantasy sense of the word only makes sense in a context where there is no real economic activity taking place in the economy
[01:01:11] <KillerWasp> a real guild in the real life.

[01:05:33] <KillerWasp> sonny: gross and bored... Anyone knows what a consultant should be like, and it totally differs from my idea of the guild.
[01:05:49] <sonny> amusing strip
[01:06:49] <sonny> software is so poorly made it'd be impossible to make a guild

[01:09:24] <sonny> http://harmful.cat-v.org/standards/
[01:09:28] <KillerWasp> well, that's why they always start at rank F, and if they only do bad jobs they get stuck in that rank while other good ones go up in rank, it's what I said how trust is earned.
[01:09:34] <sonny> joke, but the sentiment seems common enough
[01:09:47] <pulse> C++, less harmful alternative C
[01:09:48] <pulse> :D
[01:10:18] <sonny> software reuse happens but it doesn't seem to be going well
[01:10:37] <KillerWasp> At least it can be said that members of rank B and above are very trustworthy for any company, and that is what the guild establishes.
[01:10:59] <nomagno> pulse: Offensive
[01:11:02] <sonny> how do you get rank B people to join?
[01:11:08] <sonny> they can just do their own thing
[01:11:18] <nomagno> pulse: wait no
[01:11:27] <nomagno> Are you missing a comma there!?
[01:11:38] <KillerWasp> You earn that with time, you can speed up your ascent with strict tests.
[01:11:58] <KillerWasp> sonny: ^
[01:13:24] <KillerWasp> Maybe at first it will be somewhat chaotic, high ranking members are needed in a guild, so there will be a lot of tests. And it will take maybe a few years for the ranks to stabilize, but I don't think it's going to jump to B in just 2 months.
[01:14:30] <KillerWasp> Initially the guild will start with F rank members working your way up to D or C, and then it will get harder. There won't be any members from B up for a long time.
[01:15:14] <KillerWasp> that will be seen, if I find formidable members who deserve to be A or S.
[01:15:45] <sonny> I'd rather everyone start at A and drop based on the number of bugs in their software 
[01:16:20] <KillerWasp> sonny: That is, a rigorous test for all candidates?
[01:16:46] <sonny> probably no test
[01:17:11] <nomagno> Or, a job interview

[03:02:13] <bjs> dan01[m]: you can either make the address also be in a register (like Arm does), or use fancier encodings (like relative offsets) to pack more things into the bytes, or use more than 64-bits per instruction.  A 64-bit machine doesn't have to have 64-bit instructions.

[09:09:22] <InPhase> KillerWasp: You're piling nonsense on top.  That's not what graphene is, and there is no graphene used in any of the vaccines.  The mRNA vaccines are mRNA encapsulated in lipid vesicles, and in a standard phosphate buffer.  These are quite benign ingredients actually.  I used to work with very similar things in the lab.

Ultimately, reputation in 
[09:30:34] <InPhase> science has to do with what other people in science think of a person's work and their ability to do more science.

[16:31:03] <ProfSimm> Do we have a programming language where when you invoke a function with arguments, it gets replaced with its result, so next time you call it you're actually calling the result.
[16:31:25] <ProfSimm> So a function has to constantly recreate itself to act as a normal function

[16:48:54] <BASHitup> I could have spent another 30K on a CompSci degree but everything I ever really needed to know, I learned in 15 min IRC chats. 
[16:48:55] <Decker> doesn't cron maintain a syslog of launches?
[16:49:25] <BASHitup> Cron is a task scheduler. I assume originally it made more sense when email systems weren't as fancy 
[16:49:27] <jelly> Decker, it does.  syslog has to be configured to log cron.* somewhere, for a start
[16:49:29] <amigojapan> BASHitup: I did nto take compsci, I took software engineering ;)
[16:49:35] <BASHitup> So, a sysadmin really relied on Cron to get notifications.

[16:50:50] <jelly> Decker, at least Debian-based distros keep cron.* logging DISABLED by default because of potential privacy issues
[16:50:59] <BASHitup> My B.A. is in philosphy. The closest I've come to CompSci are the symbolic logic courses I had to take in my program to get my B.A. 
[16:51:06] <amigojapan> BASHitup: I think you can learn everything about sysadmin online for free
[16:51:36] <amigojapan> BASHitup: why CompSci tho? that is not about computers and is not about science

[16:52:43] <BASHitup> I think there has to be a more efficient way to do this. I suck with coworkers and get deathly wrathful over petty digingenuous office politics. Thus, I get canned after only being on the job for four months, albiet most of my positions have been contract roles.

[16:58:07] <Decker> amigojapan is it like typescript then?  the issue with porting to just JS and web would be the 3d runtime
[16:58:08] <amigojapan> Decker: both languages were coupled in a way, so I think it was implemented in c#
[16:58:28] <amigojapan> Decker: better than type script, this one was very intuitive
[16:58:52] <amigojapan> Decker: for example you would code like var v1 : String

[17:44:30] <nomagno> Raziel: I've streamed games from my PC to my Phone
[17:44:32] <nomagno> Called moonlight
[17:44:35] <DnzAtWrk> That's why I said streaming for VR
[17:44:47] <Raziel> nomagno, I've used moonlight too, but to stream directly to my TV instead (it's an android tv)
[17:45:08] <nomagno> I recommend sunshine + moonlight
[17:45:17] <Raziel> and ofc all of that happened over LAN, not 5G :p
[17:45:21] <nomagno> Sunshine is a replacement for the proprietary nvidia gamestream server
[17:45:28] <Raziel> I suppose if I was on the go and really wanted to watch some youtubes

[17:45:40] <DnzAtWrk> what about things like Stadia
[17:45:47] <DnzAtWrk> that could benefit from 5G couldn't it
[17:46:05] <ProfSimm> Box = ordered container. Bag = associative unordered container. Do the terms make sense?

[17:55:38] <wedr> Raziel, that's why, to compensate the lack of technical power, Nintendo opted to market cloud gaming on the Switch as an alternate for other developers / 3rd party publishers to try publishing their games on Nintendo platforms.

[18:36:25] <DnzAtWrk> they should deprecate censor bars
[18:36:52] <merijn> The main "worry" with 5G that it's directional broadcasting allows for much higher intensity than previous towers and the effects of long-term exposure to that intensity aren't well known yet.

[18:37:14] <DnzAtWrk> merijn, but how does that make sense
[18:37:31] <DnzAtWrk> why would being able to direct a beam cause a higher overall energy usage

[18:37:59] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: I have a conspiracy answer. 
[18:38:02] <duuude> If they want to stick towers at every square centimeter for coverage for us to have fast internet, isn't wifi already doing that?

[19:24:06] <sonny> seemed like it was for them
[19:24:13] <InPhase> amigojapan: I imagine you'd first put an open license on them, like creative commons of some sort.  Then you could identify a film prof and send them off.  Although they might in fact be a little long for most film student projects.
[19:24:23] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: it's a complication, but also a challenge (the period setting)
[19:24:33] <sonny> (they still want to include large file support)
[19:24:36] <BASHitup> so it's echo s > /proc/sysrq-trigger ... but it won't run as a regular user.

[20:20:50] <psydroid> lol
[20:20:53] <sonny> snake how did you determine that?
[20:21:01] <InPhase> psydroid: Microsoft missed the boat on a successful phone option, and lost out on tablets, so it lost monopoly control over personal computing devices as the distribution of those shifted.  So it pivoted to online business cloud service offerings.
[20:21:02] <psydroid> GNU/Linux runs everything except the desktop
[20:21:10] <psydroid> the desktop is the final frontier
[20:21:36] <snake> sonny, my personal experience with the community in the ##linux channel has been quite toxic very frequently

[20:23:36] <InPhase> psydroid: And of Azure offerings that Microsoft makes, most of its revenue there actually comes from Linux servers that they offer.  So rather than a competitor, Linux is one of the key driver's of Microsoft's revenue now.

[20:27:15] <psydroid> InPhase, Microsoft is still in co-opetition with other companies after admitting defeat on the mobile and the server side, which is a good thing. They won't give up the desktop/laptop client that easily, probably for good reasons. But it is happening slowly but surely anyway.

[20:46:42] <merijn> They bought it because every single student is learning to use github at university. And github is now integrated their actions with Azure's infrastructure. Where students get free credits to run stuff. Almost as if their business plan is "get students used to using github and Azure cloud so that when they enter the corporate world they wanna keep using these things and companies will happily pay for 
[20:46:49] <merijn> Azure"
[20:46:58] <flakland> students use it, also their direct business competition uses it
[20:47:24] <sonny> merijn is this like "brain capital" or something?
[20:47:53] <sonny> so when those students get employed they say, let's switch to azure github workflow
[20:48:04] <merijn> Basically
[20:48:09] <sonny> interesting
[20:48:20] <sonny> that did happen with unix, but it was not intentional
[20:48:56] <merijn> The key problem MS was facing is "a whole generation of FOSS using students is learning to program/run stuff on linux and other clouds, so why would they ever start using azure"
[20:49:33] <merijn> Clearly the big money in the near future of tech is "the cloud", so the strategic objective becomes "get people to use our cloud and cloud tools"
[20:50:19] <sonny> so they actually are doing osdev, just distributed
[20:50:22] <sonny> haha
[20:50:27] <merijn> "buying the most popular code hosting platform, running it at a loss while dramatically simplifying the use of our cloud/cloud tools from it" sounds like a pretty obvious way to get more people using your cloud tools and buying community good will

[21:55:27] <Tech_8> hi
[21:55:35] <Tech_8> Numocha
[21:55:46] <Numocha> This is honestly my first time using IRC for real
[21:55:53] <GeDaMo> Welcome! :)
[21:56:01] <Tech_8> really, how did you find out about it?
[21:56:06] <Numocha> I had to look up and adopt a bunch of configs for WeeChat
[21:56:35] <Numocha> I want to become really good at using the Terminal and want tostick to TUI apps
[21:56:44] <Numocha> instead of apps with a GUI
[21:57:10] <Numocha> I heard all the cool kids and greybeards use IRC so I had to learn how to use it ;)
[21:57:15] <Tech_8> you can chat, listen to music and browse the web all from terminal
[21:57:19] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors)
[21:58:03] <piou> TUI is great for many things, but I wouldn't recommend it for image editing or web browsing (even though there are of course options for both and even cases where it's preferable)
[21:58:13] <flakland> you could even listen to /dev/urandom !
[21:58:21] <piou> a touch of GUI is nice too
[21:58:41] <GeDaMo> I saw a headline today about an atomic model viewer that worked in the console
[21:58:51] <Numocha> That is true piou. I use LibreWolf for a browser

[22:06:32] <Numocha> How's POSIX shell scripting for a beginner language? I do use the terminal a LOT, and it'd be nice to know how to write some scripts to make life easier, I think

[22:08:04] <GeDaMo> I'm not sure I'd recommend Bash as a beginner language, maybe Python
[22:08:10] <oldlaptop> Numocha: It has the advantage that you know some of its rules already, and some interesting properties, but unfortunately it has a lot of pitfalls that you don't really want to worry about when starting out.
[22:08:13] <yitz> Numocha: bash is much nicer than POSIX. Avoid the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide; it sucks.
[22:08:22] <Numocha> not exactly bash, POSIX actually
[22:08:22] <flakland> shell scripting is rough, there are many flavors as a beginner it will be difficult to tell if you're reading POSIX sh or some other language
[22:08:34] *** Quits: rickybob2 (~rickybob@35.143.255.39) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:08:44] <pikapika> I think C is the best beginner language
[22:08:51] <alefir> indeed
[22:08:56] <oldlaptop> I would contend that if a program "needs" bashisms that's a strong sign it should not be in any sh derivative.
[22:08:57] <Numocha> I have heard people recommend C, yeah
[22:09:07] <yitz> But yeah. I'd also recommend Python (high level) or C (understanding lower level details) over shell.
[22:09:07] <piou> I would strongly recommend not starting with C
[22:09:15] <Numocha> since it is an OG and apparently it will help one understand how computers work better?
[22:09:19] <pikapika> C++ is a good second option then
[22:09:34] <pikapika> But the use of the stl must be banned initially
[22:09:41] <Numocha> stl?
[22:09:48] <yitz> Isn't modern C++ all about STL?
[22:10:03] <alefir> isn't modern c++ the bad part of c++
[22:10:05] <pikapika> yitz, a first time learner should create their data structures themselves
[22:10:20] <pikapika> The STL should be banned from use, only from initial learning phase
[22:10:27] <piou> Numocha: standard template library, a set of tools for C++
[22:10:32] <oldlaptop> Tcl is interesting in that it includes some of the strong points sh does have, while being more sensible as a general-purpose programming language
[22:10:39] <yitz> C was my first language. I used to be able to read/write C++. Modern C++ looks like a completely different language

[22:11:20] *** Quits: BASHitup (~richard@user/yippeekaiyay) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[22:11:21] <oldlaptop> the main reason I'd hesitate to suggest it as a *first* language is that it's a very different model from most common languages today
[22:11:22] <pikapika> The fact that people have written so many embedded DSLs in C++ should give you a hint
[22:11:44] *** Joins: BASHitup (~richard@user/yippeekaiyay)
[22:11:46] <pikapika> Anyways, yes
[22:11:47] <oldlaptop> Still, take a look if you're particularly attracted to sh for some reason.
[22:11:50] <flakland> STL was around in  around the 99 standard, modern c++ is about auto pointers and other weird features, yes it does look completely alien
[22:11:54] <pikapika> C++ is too vast for a first time learner
[22:11:58] <pikapika> So C is better recommended
[22:13:01] <pikapika> flakland, I did not claim STL should not be used
[22:13:11] <piou> Numocha: regardless of any debate arround C etc, if you want to spend more time at the command line you need to understand it, and that means learning to script. Since you're probably using bash (would highly recommend upgrading to zsh, but still) then you should learn bash scripting. No way arround it.
[22:13:12] <BASHitup> Today I learned that if you go with echo s > /proc/sysrq-trigger with no sudo, it fails. But if you go with sudo sh -c "echo s > /proc/sysrq-trigger", it will execute even as a cron job. 
[22:13:18] *** Quits: Sadale (~Sadale@user/sadale) (Quit: tawa pona!)

[22:13:35] <BASHitup> But probably a bad idea to be pulling funny business like that in a production environment 
[22:13:44] <pikapika> Remembering the point that this is about someones first introduction to programming
[22:13:53] <BASHitup> It's not 
[22:13:54] <flakland> yeah, and how to use templates on their own without the prebaked classes
[22:14:07] <BASHitup> I'd say he has plenty of experience! You BRUTE. SAVAGE! 
[22:14:08] <pikapika> Obviously someone learning C++ as their next language should be using the library from the beginning
[22:14:10] <oldlaptop> piou: I doubt anyone would dispute that. Whether learning sh scripting as a first language is a good plan is a harder question.

[22:14:29] <BASHitup> Shameless louts, come down from the heavens, thee 
[22:14:40] <pikapika> piou, I think learning the command line involves understanding the pipe etc
[22:14:44] <pikapika> as in how the pipe works
[22:14:49] <piou> Numocha: the bad side is that it's quite the shitty language, it has lots of exceptions and little things that almost make sense but not quite. The good side is that you'll quickly be able to do real things, interract with your whole system as well as the internet, learn the basics of programming structures. 
[22:14:53] <pikapika> Again, C should help in that understanding too
[22:14:54] <piou> pikapika: nah, that's really not necessary
[22:15:04] <BASHitup> I would say that everything you need to know about pipes can be solved with ps aux | grep <command>
[22:15:04] <piou> pikapika: shell scripting is all about high-level
[22:15:12] <pikapika> piou, I feel I don't properly know bash because I don't understand the workings of the pipe
[22:15:19] <pikapika> I should learn the pipe

[22:15:50] <piou> oldlaptop: I don't think so, because waiting to be proficient in any other language (C or python or otherwise) would just be detrimental
[22:15:52] <pikapika> Yes I'd say C is the best as a first time language

[22:18:30] <piou> Numocha: as far as spending more time in a shell goes, learn bash, don't worry about learning "real" programming. You can (and probably should) learn real programming too, and bash will not be a suitable language for that, just consider the two separate things really.
[22:18:35] <BASHitup> Given my random fluctuations of mood etc ... all bad things. 
[22:18:53] <BASHitup> No, you can't learn everything with bash, man

[22:18:58] <BASHitup> I agree with like 98% of that 
[22:19:07] <yitz> Plenty of people use fish or zsh as their shell of choice ... but shell scripts tend to be bash more often than anything else
[22:19:09] <BASHitup> But you won't learn how to use brackets and if statements etc just by bash 
[22:19:15] <BASHitup> I don't know how to use conditionals, really

Python is the stock answer you'll get for "beginner language" these days, and there are good reasons for that. If you particularly want a "real language" that works as much like sh as possible, Tcl is that language.

[22:40:25] <pikapika> oldlaptop, my main point is
[22:40:28] <alycidyne> Learned Prolog :)
[22:40:34] <BASHitup> That's good 
[22:40:41] <BASHitup> I took logic as a philosophy student 
[22:40:50] <oldlaptop> I think he overstates the case with all the stuff about permanent brain damage, but GOTO probably isn't a good choice for Baby's First Flow Control.
[22:40:51] <alycidyne> BASHitup: Nice!
[22:41:03] <BASHitup> Technically, logic is for practical purposes strictly philosophy ... Aristotle did his modus ponens 
[22:41:08] <pikapika> If we start with some language that has automatic memory management and has strings, lists, hash tables etc trivially available (and worse confuses between the three concepts), its a really bad language to start with
[22:41:11] <BASHitup> Symbolic logic is basically math with figures 
[22:41:24] <BASHitup> It's straight up math. My wife wants to say it's not as good as calculus
[22:41:26] <pikapika> It will create a mental model in the brain thats worse than wrong
[22:41:44] <BASHitup> Well, what do you guys think: Is high-level symbolic logic as tough or rigorous as calc? 
[22:41:44] <pikapika> oldlaptop, actually GOTO is great
[22:41:55] <nomagno> I can't imagine a major called 'CompSci' that doesn't reasonably advanced math courses
[22:41:58] <nomagno> that's just be IT or software engineering
[22:41:58] <pikapika> We got to learn how to build loops and if, else etc with goto
[22:41:59] <Numocha> I have to wonder if it's possible for someone who only learned programming on their own to find a job
[22:42:01] <BASHitup> Can one substitute calculus with logic and be a good coder? 
[22:42:09] <pikapika> Then structured programming made natural sense when it was introduced to us
[22:42:11] <Numocha> without a degree
[22:42:19] <flakland> yeah you don't need to know calculus at all
[22:42:27] <BASHitup> What do you mean, is it possible? Numocha -- there are hundreds of people like that on LinkedIn whom I see every day 
[22:42:27] <sonny> Numocha depends on your country
[22:42:28] <pyzozord> BASHitup: one can be a good coder without any math at all
[22:42:40] <nomagno> Numocha: I believe most programmers nowadays are relying on portfolio only

[22:43:04] <oldlaptop> pikapika: That could be a reasonable approach, sure. It has obvious hazards, though.
[22:43:29] <nomagno> I'm honestly unsure 'calculus' on its own means anything
[22:43:36] <pikapika> Our professor taught us loop construction very clearly and solidly
[22:43:45] <alycidyne> It's one thing to write a good program; it's another thing to write a good module; it's yet another thing to write a good system of modules and programs.

[23:04:52] <eson123> i mean no judgy, processing that much data without slowing the system down or overflowing the memory is nice but is there anymore of its concept than just that ?

[23:08:07] <pikapika> They explain the basic concept well, and you don't have to deal with needlessly confusing countless addressing schemes
[23:08:09] <AbleBacon> Numocha, i'd recommend python really, though. for getting a fast start on programming, and for something you can get a job with
[23:08:28] <Numocha> THen Python it is
[23:08:47] <alycidyne> flakland: I do believe what I think, but at least I keep it to myself
[23:08:47] <pikapika> ie whether so and so instruction takes a pointer or a base+offset or a register with a pointer to a pointer etc
[23:08:48] <AbleBacon> if you wanna do C these days, you'd be working on embedded devices probably--and you probably need to know electronics or at least have some kind of engineering degree to work on those kinds of thigns. but you should eventually visit C to get a deeper understanding of how computers work
[23:08:55] <apotheon> flakland: That seems like the statement of someone who doesn't actually know what philosophy is, and thinks it's some dipshit spouting woo-woo crap in a self-help book.

[23:10:28] <AbleBacon> when i learned references, my understanding was "oh it just sends the actual object without copying it" and the model i had in my brain didn't involve pointers or memory addresses, you know?
[23:10:32] <pikapika> actually of course understanding pointers first and the natural way to pass around heavy objects makes the intuition for what would be a reference and what won't in your scripting lang quite intuitive of course

[23:19:02] <alycidyne> AbleBacon: I start by mentioning file sizes, and then explaining what those 'megabytes' contain

[23:25:47] <apotheon> Numocha: Do you learn better by memorization or by assimilating principles?
[23:25:50] <bjs> pikapika: well you're very much in the minority,  and literally millions of people learn Python as their first language every year across the world in universities, schools, coding "camps" and what not
[23:25:53] <nomagno> like, some people genuinely thing awk, sed, and sh are almost useless

[23:25:58] <AbleBacon> yeah alyc people tend to over-complicate code. i hate it. and really, like, in C/C++ sometimes the "clever" things that people try to do for optimization actually *prevent* the compiler from recognizing common patterns and doing its optimization

[23:30:28] <bjs> pikapika: but all this is irrelevant to most beginners, they just want to learn to program to be able to do things. They don't care about how exactly the memory gets allocated or how the thing gets parsed, that comes much later.
[23:30:39] <AbleBacon> avoiding the mallocs and frees is a double-edged sword, because you do need to learn at some point that your high-level code is allocating and freeing data behind the scenes
[23:30:44] <oldlaptop> apotheon: "ability to grow into OOP" is arguably a weak point (for Tcl), although there actually is an object system in the core now
[23:30:56] <pikapika> bjs, and if they start with 'Haskell' they will have to relearn everything from the beginning for that
[23:30:59] <alycidyne> pikapika: e.g. `search_function = re.compile(search_string).search`. I'd bet you can easily speed up a loop with that
[23:31:05] <bjs> pikapika: depends what they do afterwards
[23:31:07] <apotheon> oldlaptop: Yeah, growing into OOP is a nice-to-have for a first language rather than a must-have, though.
[23:31:10] <pikapika> Whereas with traditional languages, its more like filling in their blanks in the already existing structure
[23:31:15] <alycidyne> Pass it to filter unmodified

[23:32:22] <oldlaptop> it fits well that way, because after all everything is a command
[23:32:52] <apotheon> Numocha: I guess that works for you, then.  In that case, Ruby might be a good choice for your first language.  Two things I'd recommend as early resources for learning are the book Eloquent Ruby and the online Ruby On Rails Guides.
[23:33:16] <Numocha> Are ruby programmers in good demand?
[23:33:24] <pikapika> So its some kind of social network app?
[23:33:35] <oldlaptop> I wouldn't focus too much on that. Once you know one or two languages, learning more isn't that hard.
[23:33:40] <alycidyne> pikapika: perhaps, but still, I dream about how many Python apps are waiting to be unlocked with simple tricks like that
[23:33:45] <bjs> Numocha: I would still strongly recommend starting with Python,  it comes with lots of stuff builtin and a good set of popular libraries for doing all sorts of useful things. Literally millions of people around the world each year start with Python as their first language and there's a huge amount of resources on it.
[23:33:57] <apotheon> Numocha: It's systematic in design, can actually be gentle in its introduction to OOP by way of making it transparently part of the learning process, has great learning resources, and is mostly hindered by a need for heavy reliance on documentation -- which seems fine for you.
[23:33:57] <alycidyne> Unless I'm underestimating the quality of Python programmers
[23:34:10] <oldlaptop> (Although learning a "pure functional" language like Haskell can be a bit of a mind-bender if you started with something imperative.)

[23:46:19] <apotheon> Numocha: Based on what I've seen in this discussion, and from your statements about learning in answer to my questions, I really think you might have a good experience learning Ruby.  You might want to check out the #ruby channel; the community tends to be friendly and helpful.
[23:46:32] <BASHitup> No one talks about perl here. I need to learn it though. Any thoughts on it? 
[23:46:33] <Numocha> I will, thank you
[23:46:36] <apotheon> Numocha: Working on projects of your own is well-supported.
[23:46:36] <alycidyne> Good night BASHitup 
[23:46:40] <BASHitup> I'm not leaving, haha 
[23:46:44] <Numocha> apotheon: do you have a list of good resources for me to start with?
[23:46:49] <pikapika> bjs, it is, but as I said, the difference is in the language specification: Haskell's specification is very anti-computer or computer-orthogonal. C's is mostly computer-supportive.
[23:46:51] <nomagno> Is it me or is programming nowadays kinda less specialized than it used to be?
[23:46:51] <BASHitup> What!? It's only 3:15 pm where I am. I'm near NYC

[23:47:00] <alycidyne> BASHitup: oops :)
[23:47:00] <BASHitup> Close to the ocean, dare friends.
[23:47:02] <BASHitup> *dear
[23:47:06] <BASHitup> boobs
[23:47:14] <alycidyne> :D
[23:47:21] <bjs> pikapika: idk, -O3 or god forbid -Os generates code that is incredibly unpredictable in my experience and takes a lot of work to reverse engineer it to see how it got there
[23:47:31] <apotheon> Numocha: First resources, as I said, would be the links I provided for the Eloquent Ruby book, the Rails Guides online, ruby-doc.org, and rubyapi.org.
[23:47:39] <alycidyne> bjs: -Os is okay, -O3 is basically useless IMO
[23:47:54] <nomagno> BASHitup: We don't talk about perl because TIM TOADY BICARBONATE
[23:47:55] <nomagno> AKA Perl's lemma
[23:47:55] <bjs> alycidyne: useless in terms of what?
[23:47:59] <_73> BASHitup: we were just talking about Perl actually. I think it's a lot of fun to write, has terrific documentation, and has a huge amount of library support on CPAN. The #perl channel is quite active and helpful as well.
[23:48:00] <apotheon> Numocha: I'd mostly recommend Eloquent Ruby and rubyapi.org to start.
[23:48:06] <pikapika> bjs, my point isn't that. I already said gcc's optimizations are magical.
[23:48:14] <alycidyne> bjs: -O3's opts are useful only if you're doing PGO
[23:48:17] <apotheon> Numocha: . . . though I personally like ruby-doc.org more than rubyapi.org for looking up documentation.
[23:48:24] <pikapika> My point was that both compilers are obviously constrained by the language spec.
[23:48:24] <alycidyne> which requires changing the whole build system at least
[23:48:25] <oldlaptop> bjs: Synergizing a bit with the problem of UB, what does this compile to? `for (int index = 1; index > 0; index++) do_something_observable(index);`
[23:48:27] <nomagno> BASHitup: it's a phonetic acronym for: 'There's more than one way to do it, but sometimes consistency is maybe a good thing too'
[23:48:38] <pikapika> The only thing is, Haskells language spec is quite anti-computer
[23:48:45] <apotheon> Numocha: The thing about rubyapi.org is that the main page has direct links to some of the most commonly useful library APIs' documentation.
[23:48:53] <pikapika> whereas C's is mostly similar to how you would want the computer to do
[23:48:55] <pikapika> Basically
[23:48:57] <nomagno> AKA you can do crap in perl however you feel like it, but most valid solutions are either horrendous or incredibly incomprehensible or ugly
[23:48:59] <Inline__> for(;;)
[23:49:02] <bjs> pikapika: but you said the definition of "Opaque" was not being able to tell what the compiler compiled it to,  but with optimizations being so magical you can't do that for C
[23:49:13] <pikapika> Tell me this for example, take any random haskell feature and tell me whats the simplest implementation you could do for it with asm and C
[23:49:17] <bjs> pikapika: so C is also opaque (when using GCC or Clang at least), for the same reason Haskell is opaque (when using GHC)
[23:49:18] <oldlaptop> Inline__: That's one reasonable real-world option, sure
[23:49:18] <nomagno> So it reduces to 'many concise ways to do crap, only one good concise way to do specific crap'
[23:49:30] <alycidyne> Inline__: *IF* the compiler assumes overflow never occurs - which it doesn't need to
[23:49:30] <oldlaptop> (alas, it is not the "right answer", because there isn't one)
[23:49:45] *** Inline__ is now known as Inline
[23:50:01] <pikapika> You can reasonably hand compile C code, and it will work and generate the same output as the gcc output. Only much less efficient of course.
[23:50:09] <_73> I think perl code is quite nice to look at and read actually.
[23:50:16] <apotheon> Numocha: It's difficult to overstate how *very good* Eloquent Ruby is to learning a programming language.  I don't think I've ever seen a book do such a good job.
[23:50:17] <alycidyne> Remember, UB means you have forfeited all expectations about your code
[23:50:23] <oldlaptop> The point isn't so much that "well it can make demons fly out ur noz lol" but that what actually happens is going to depend in practice on semi-random things like which compiler and which compiler options you picked
[23:50:25] <pikapika> You can't reasonable explain how many Haskell features would get implemented internally
[23:50:29] <nomagno> pikapika: Uh, well Haskell is on a different level of abstraction to C, and C to assembly
[23:50:37] *** Quits: dunkeln (~dunkeln@user/dunkeln) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:50:40] <pikapika> nomagno, its not just about abstraction level
[23:50:42] <apotheon> Numocha: Apologies if I missed it, but . . . what OS are you using?
[23:50:44] <nomagno> So the comparison isn't very fair
[23:50:47] <pikapika> Java is arguably higher level than C
[23:50:52] <oldlaptop> (those who think C is basically on the same level as assembly decieve themselves)
[23:50:56] <pikapika> But its still generally quite intuitive
[23:51:05] <pikapika> oldlaptop, C is quite high level yes
[23:51:17] <bjs> pikapika: sure you can, "most" Haskell features are just light sugar over some very simple core language and that core language has a fairly obvious compilation scheme.  I mean you need to be highly skilled in either language to be able to actually do the hand-compilation *correctly* but it's totally possible either way
[23:51:20] <apotheon> Java is *quite* intuitive . . . if you're a bureaucrat at heart.
[23:51:27] <nomagno> pikapika: When you consider machine code is imperative and sequential on ONLY composed of side-effects, it kinda is

[23:51:39] <Numocha> apotheon: I use Linux, EndeavourOS
[23:51:40] <Inline> welp, for ever until UB
[23:51:50] <apotheon> Numocha: That's good.  Have you used the command line a lot?
[23:51:53] <pikapika> nomagno, which kinda is
[23:51:54] <oldlaptop> pikapika: If you mean to say that haskell is not imperative, that much is trivially true. I don't see how your desired conclusion follows from that, though.
[23:51:57] <Inline> cause int is signed afaik
[23:51:59] <bjs> Inline: "forever until UB" doesn't sound like a sensible statement :P
[23:52:05] <pikapika> oldlaptop, I don't mean to say that
[23:52:07] <Numocha> apotheon: I use it every day. I would say I am very familiar with the command line now
[23:52:07] <alycidyne> Inline: even that isn't guaranteed
[23:52:09] <pikapika> 'BrainFuck' is also imperative
[23:52:17] <apotheon> Numocha: Have you dont some shell scripting?
[23:52:20] <Numocha> apotheon: I have been learning A LOT about Linux ever since I started using it
[23:52:21] <Inline> it will overflow yes but from then on it's UB
[23:52:21] <alycidyne> Inline: because a function is undefined if a single statement thereof is undefined
[23:52:25] <nomagno> pikapika: 'only about abstaction level'
[23:52:30] <alycidyne> Inline: and thus the whole program recursively
[23:52:32] <Inline> there's no wraparound like in unsigned
[23:52:34] <bjs> Inline: that's a common misunderstanding of UB
[23:52:38] <Numocha> apotheon: No I have not yet learned shell scripting, I am still learning some basic sysadmin stuff
[23:52:38] <apotheon> s/dont/done/
[23:52:40] <BASHitup> Does Perl offer anything that Python cannot or does not or should not by design? 
[23:52:44] <apotheon> okay
[23:52:46] <pikapika> It has nothing to do with abstraction level either
[23:52:47] <bjs> Inline: the program either has UB, or doesn't have UB. The program doesn't "become" UB
[23:52:49] <BASHitup> Why would someone want to specifically know Perl? 
[23:52:54] <pikapika> Some people would consider Java a higher level language than C
[23:52:57] <bjs> Inline: (as far as C goes anyway)
[23:53:04] <pikapika> Yet I'd say Java is still generally quite intuitive
[23:53:23] <BASHitup> I think, have thought and will think that C is what you would learn if you need to know all of the foundation programming skills. 
[23:53:24] <apotheon> Numocha: Exposure to the command line is helpful for getting ready to learn programming.  A little shell scripting would be helpful for that, too, but at a guess I'd say you're probably quite ready for Eloquent Ruby.
[23:53:27] <alycidyne> bjs: more specifically, an *execution* is either defined or undefined, from start to finish
[23:53:30] <pikapika> Whereas Haskell's model is very computer-orthogonal and even actively anti-computer
[23:53:34] <apotheon> Numocha: May I send you a private message?
[23:53:36] <BASHitup> If a person knows C well, I assume they will quickly pick up everything else. 
[23:53:42] <alycidyne> bjs: (which includes the args with which the program was run)
[23:53:45] <Numocha> apotheon: Of course!
[23:54:00] <dTal> why do people ask that. just send the message
[23:54:06] <bjs> Inline: for example programs that have signed integer overflow can often be compiled into programs that do not have overflow at all, and so the program when ran doesn't actually ever overflow. Instead it just does something terribly wrong because the optimizer decided to.
[23:54:12] <nomagno> BASHitup: you would, probably, be kinda wrong. C requires an extremely specific kind of software architecture knowledge
[23:54:15] <oldlaptop> dTal: Because we can't have nice things.
[23:54:34] <_73> BASHitup: cause perl is available everywhere and easy to write. The same can be said of other languages though. Some people (like me) just find it especially easy to write.
[23:54:45] <nomagno> You're going to have a hard time touching FP if you only do procedural programming
[23:54:45] <pikapika> dTal, some people seem to get panic attacks from a text message sent to their dms
[23:54:50] <pikapika> Its just a thing
[23:54:54] <pikapika> I never understood how
[23:54:55] <oldlaptop> _73: Are you tellin' me that there's an element of personal taste here?!
[23:54:58] <pikapika> but yeah
[23:55:05] <Numocha> to be honest I have been learning what I can from rwxrob's Beginner Boost series lol
[23:55:12] <BASHitup> Perl is used for Metasploit. That's how I know about it. The hacker dudes say that Python would be perfect if Metasploit used it but H.D. Moore chose Perl. 
[23:55:19] <BASHitup> I'm always curious as to why he made his decision 
[23:55:19] <Numocha> if any of you might know him

[23:55:28] <Inline> kinda funny somehow
[23:55:39] <bjs> alycidyne: yeah
[23:55:42] <pikapika> Numocha, boost is a C++ library
[23:55:44] <alycidyne> Inline: C is nuts in the way that machine code (and CPU vendors in general) are nuts
[23:55:50] <pikapika> so you decided to learn C++?
[23:55:52] <Inline> i thought it's much more low level
[23:55:55] <Inline> it's not
[23:56:05] <apotheon> Perl is great for a particular type of intuitive approach to programming, and not so great for a particular detailed approach.  For the latter, there's Python.
[23:56:16] <BASHitup> I wouldn't call IRC a "modern" social network ... dont' know the hint above. But the people hardcore about IRC, presumably, aren't the same people chacking their Facebook account every five minutes.

[23:57:36] <Numocha> pikapika: No I mean I am leaarning from a Twitch streamer called "rwxrob" who has a series of lessons called "The Beginner Boost" that aims to guide complete beginners to getting into tech
[23:57:59] <apotheon> yeah, not every reference to "boost" is about the C++ lib
[23:58:07] <apotheon> but it's an easy source of confusion
[23:59:08] <alycidyne> oldlaptop: I'm saddened by the thought that builtin/intrinsic functions will never replace assembly because hardware vendors can't be bothered to even offer a decent souce-level API to their hardware

[23:59:27] <Inline> yeah
[23:59:51] <oldlaptop> alycidyne: the assembly instructions themselves aren't even anything like the way the hardware really works, though, that's the perverse thing
