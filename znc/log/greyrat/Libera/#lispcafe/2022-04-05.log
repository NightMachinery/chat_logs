[00:01:46] <gilberth> But one strategy was to just put those 256-byte aligned things last. But: They may not be 256 bytes long, so there is room between say a 128 byte buffer and another say 80 byte buffer, which both should be 256-byte aligned.

[04:11:05] <gilberth> Hmm. I know the ORG directive to place the current address at a certain value. It basically says that the next emitted byte must be at that address. Say you start at 0100h and have some RAM at 02000h, you say ORG 0100h \n START: ... \n ORG 02000h \n BUF: DS 100 \n CURBLAH: DW 123 \n ... So far so good.
[04:12:05] <gilberth> May I have a BORG directive which says the byte just before it must right below a certain address?
[04:13:43] <gilberth> Say you have RAM from 02000h to 03000h. I want to say to be able to place a stack by saying STACK DS 100 \n BORG 03000h
[04:14:57] <gilberth> Or the other way around. First say "BORG 03000h" and then have DS, DW, DB, etc grow downwards. But I guess that would be very confusing, too.

[14:02:24] <selwyn> found something that is unspecified in the rules
[14:09:13] <gilberth> Hmm, coming up with a relocatable format isn't as easy as I believed. I am far from being satisfied with what I have.
[14:10:29] <gilberth> Still, I believe putting expressions into the relocatable object file is the right thing. That way you could have an universal linker, which doesn't care about the architecture at all.
[14:15:30] <gilberth> BTW have you noticed that $AMD has the WKN (Wertpapierkennnummer, German Securities Identification Number) 863186. Watch the 86 in there. Twice. Coincidence?
[14:22:34] <selwyn> i think not
[14:24:31] <gilberth> Intel has the rather boring 855681. Hmm.

[16:33:28] <scymtym> hayley: if you are using mcclim, you can load mcclim-raster-image and use (mcclim-raster-image:with-output-to-raster-image-file (stream "FILENAME") DRAW-TO-STREAM). and similar for ps and pdf. upstream mcclim may have changed the interface a bit, but the capability is definitely there
[16:36:35] <scymtym> if you define DRAW-DISTANCES as a command with (define-command (draw-distances :provide-output-destination-keyword t) ...), the command will hook into the above mechanism to draw to standard output (for example the listener) by default and to a raster/vector file if the :output-destination keyword argument is supplied
[16:36:41] <hayley> Thanks. I don't really need to, though, I just wanted to visualise some stuff quickly.
[16:37:26] <scymtym> sure, i guessed that you were just making something quickly. i still thought the information might be interesting for future occasions
[16:41:12] <hayley> All in all, I'm doing C++ homework...but not in C++, with different data structures, and I'm not even taking that class. And I'm a hellalot more productive due to it.
[16:43:29] <hayley> The result was also thousands of times faster, due to using the right data structures. People are hitting a wall where it takes half an hour to solve a 150x100 grid maze.
[16:46:49] <hayley> Then I posted my code, and people did the usual reaction to Lisp code.

[21:23:06] <tfb> achieving fusion is a non-problem.  You can pretty much do it at home: people have. Achieving *sustained*, *energy-positive* fusion is a bit harder.  These people have done the 'fusion' bit with a technology that might one day, they hape, after spending a lot more money, give them the sustained and energy-positive bit.
