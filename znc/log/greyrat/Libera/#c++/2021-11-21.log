[00:00:41] <CarloWood> I wish C++ would just ignore trailing comma's :?
[00:01:04] <CarloWood> As in,   f(int x, int y,)  is the same as   f(int x, int y)
[00:01:54] <PJBoy> prevents unintended errors
[00:02:28] <PJBoy> like if you expanded a macro that happened to be empty, it's nice for that to be an error
[00:02:32] <cbreak> << std::vector{1,2,3,4,}
[00:02:33] <geordi> {1, 2, 3, 4}
[00:02:54] <CarloWood> Then, is it possible to pass a last argument that doesn't result in any extra code?
[00:03:02] <TinoDidriksen> C++ ignores many trailing commas, but not in function calls as they'd not play nice with overloading.
[00:03:12] *** Joins: PointThink (~PointThin@acap87.neoplus.adsl.tpnet.pl)
[00:03:15] <CarloWood> Then I can do:  f(int x, int y, LastUnusedArgument)
[00:03:38] <TinoDidriksen> Only if you have such an arg.
[00:04:24] <CarloWood> I mean, if I do:  void f(int x, int y, int);   would that push three ints to the stack, just in case the function will read the last one?
[00:04:28] <CarloWood> err
[00:04:35] <CarloWood> I mean, if I do:  void f(int x, int y, int = 0);   would that push three ints to the stack, just in case the function will read the last one?
[00:04:46] <PJBoy> I take back my reasoning then >_>
[00:05:32] <PJBoy> yeah that will definitely push three ints onto the stack
[00:05:51] <PJBoy> the function is a function that takes three arguments, and you can bind that to a function pointer
[00:06:03] <PJBoy> the default value is purely a build time convenience
[00:06:27] <CarloWood> But since it is nameless, that should indicate it isn't used :P
[00:06:40] <InPhase> PJBoy: The comma issue is actually a serious pain with making flexible macros.

[00:06:58] <InPhase> Fortunately gcc and clang extensions offer some bypasses.
[00:06:59] <PJBoy> I'm aware :)
[00:07:06] <PJBoy> there's VA_OPT nowadays though
[00:07:20] <CarloWood> The reason I am complaining also has to do with macros (of course).
[00:07:50] <PJBoy> anyways even if the int is unused, it still has a lifetime
[00:07:53] <InPhase> PJBoy: Ah, C++20 added this.  That will be a huge help for those cases.
[00:08:12] <PJBoy> matters a lot more for non trivial types of course
[00:08:36] <CarloWood> I have a debug object with "stack trace" information (it's different, but that's close enough) to pass information to functions called by functions that are called by...
[00:08:55] <CarloWood> Then I end up with ***A LOT*** of functions that look like this:
[00:08:57] <InPhase> PJBoy: I have a very useful debugging macro that has never worked right on MSVC because of that comma issue.  I will update it as soon as C++20 properly rolls out.
[00:09:05] <CarloWood> vk::UniqueFramebuffer LogicalDevice::create_framebuffer(vk::FramebufferCreateInfo const& framebuffer_create_info
[00:09:05] <CarloWood>     COMMA_CWDEBUG_ONLY(AmbifixOwner const& debug_name)) const
[00:09:05] <CarloWood> {
[00:09:42] <CarloWood> And that `COMMA_CWDEBUG_ONLY(AmbifixOwner const& debug_name)` is really starting to annoy me, especially because there is no comma in front of it; because it is empty in Release mode.
[00:09:53] <PJBoy> InPhase, that's good to hear :)
[00:11:09] <CarloWood> Maybe I should hide a thread-local member in LogicalDevice to "pass" it to all it's member functions.  Does such a thing exist? A thread local member variable/object?
[00:13:21] <PJBoy> threadlocal members are a thing, yeah

[09:21:26] <vancz> wait what "due to the rule that CharT must be a POD. (See how tricky this is?) "
[09:23:21] <vancz> re: , though leduyquang753 doesn't seem to be here right now
[09:23:21] <vancz> <Alipha> vancz: streams are meant to work with chars or char-like objects. I think you'll run into lots of trouble trying to get them to work with a custom class
[09:23:21] <vancz> <leduyquang753> Sure you can do that.

[09:25:49] *** Joins: frost (~frost@user/frost)
[09:27:02] <vancz> would maybe a workaround to that be making the CharT a pointer to  my type instead of my type itseld?
[09:29:55] <RandomReader> pointer object values are locations .. so that becomes a "string of locations", and ordinary operations "copy locations"
[09:30:04] <RandomReader> does that sound like something that would work as expected? :)
[09:31:23] <vancz> doesnt that depend on how i define my operations?
[09:31:53] <RandomReader> pointer types are built in, there aren't any user-definable operations on them
[09:32:35] <vancz> i kind of get what youre saying but not completely
[09:32:43] <vancz> can you give an example?
[09:32:56] <RandomReader> a pointer is no different from, say, "int"
[09:33:12] <RandomReader> it's a type, you make objects of that type, those objects hold values, and the type defines the available operations
[09:33:26] <vancz> ok
[09:33:30] <RandomReader> pointer is a built-in type, just like int is a built-in type, so there are no operations you can define .. they're already defined
[09:33:38] <RandomReader> int objects hold integer values, pointer objects hold location/address values
[09:33:46] <vancz> well i just have to dereference them i guess?
[09:34:10] <RandomReader> but that's not what users of CharT do

[09:34:31] <RandomReader> the *only* purpose of CharT is to fit in with what the library expects, so you can make use of the existing library functionality
[09:34:40] <vancz> dont users of CharT go through char_traits?
[09:34:41] <RandomReader> if what you have doesn't fit those expectations, then this isn't a useful path

[09:39:06] <vancz> from looking at these signatures what i could possible see being a problem is if char_type is a pointer, something might still just use pointer operations instead of the inner type oparations, and idk
[09:39:13] <RandomReader> e.g. does    s[42] = foo;   do something useful?
[09:39:43] <RandomReader> that makes sense for characters, but that doesn't provide any way to manage indirect objects

[09:40:06] <RandomReader> it's possible you could get *some* things to work, but at a basic level this idea seems to violate all kinds of expectations
[09:40:08] <vancz> move copy and assign are maybe fine but if something uses to_char_type that might be a problem? otoh thats a general function so it would only be an issue if they make some sort of assumption?

[09:41:00] <vancz> the thing is im not actually interested in making a string type, but iostreams seem to require it (i guess it makes sense, as they require an "array of characters", which is a string)

[09:42:18] <RandomReader> no, I mean why do you want a *stream* specifically?
[09:42:28] <RandomReader> what's wrong with a container of tokens you iterate over?
[09:42:32] <vancz> oh, well i thought it makes some conceptual sense
[09:43:03] <RandomReader> iostreams is so generic with so many layers in order to allow a variety of things to plug in
[09:43:03] <vancz> i could solve this in other ways but im partly doing it to see if i can, partly because "there kind of doesnt seem to be a reason this shouldnt work"

[09:45:00] <vancz> hm, i dont really follow here <RandomReader> but this sounds like a very specific use case, not something you'll be plugging in
[09:45:22] <RandomReader> I mean you described a parser consuming from a source
[09:46:00] <RandomReader> that doesn't sound like you will have multiple very different consumers or producers .. so e.g. you won't use a logging library that can redirect to cout or a file with a stream of tokens
[09:46:15] <RandomReader> or you won't attach an iterator on top of some other source
[09:46:23] <RandomReader> or any of the other "plug in" options you get with generic streams
[09:46:50] <RandomReader> or use some of the algorithms .. so e.g. order a set of tokens alphabetically
[09:46:55] <RandomReader> or lexicographically compare them
[09:47:45] <RandomReader> put another way, if your use case is specific, then all of this generic stuff seems like noise/boilerplate rather than immediately useful

[09:48:23] <vancz> i was thinking earlier "trying to define an ordering on my tokens doesnt really make sense, if the interface requires it"
[09:49:07] <RandomReader> if you do want the streams-like interface, operator<< and some common options, you could still do that easily enough with your own types
[09:49:57] <RandomReader> there would be a balance there, since you'd want to make it clear it's an abstraction for your token system and not streams in general, so as not to confuse people
[09:50:02] <Gamah> is std::mt19937_64 "random" enough for billions of iterations on things? is there something built in that's better.
[09:50:14] <RandomReader> but you'd be directly implementing just the functionality you want, instead of having to deal with layers of unnecessary things
[09:52:29] <RandomReader> Gamah - that's not a generally answerable question, pseudo-random number generation is a rabbit hole of balancing traits and requirements
[09:52:52] <Gamah> uugggghhhhh
[09:53:11] <vancz> welcome to programming, where learning syntax is the easiest thing you will ever do :P
[09:53:20] <RandomReader> if your concerns are about some kind of "security", maybe ask the ##crypto folks for help sorting out what to look at
[09:53:28] <Gamah> is there a default system random engine that uses the built in random device i can pass to std::shuffle()?
[09:53:30] <RandomReader> oops one hash, #crypto
[09:53:46] <vancz> the double hash is for extra security ;p
[09:53:51] <Gamah> RandomReader: not security, just distribution of results
[09:54:35] <RandomReader> well that's what the distributions cover :P
[09:54:42] <vancz> can you accept me just try to shoehorn this in anyway, and when it inevitably fails i will at least maybe have learned from it? i think this conversation was/is worth having though
[09:54:47] <Gamah> yeah but shuffle() just takes an engine..?
[09:55:04] <Gamah> so it's safe to assume an even distribution based on the range also passed to shuffle??

[09:56:59] <RandomReader> ok, I get where your question was coming from now
[09:57:02] <kalven> the whole point of shuffle is to reorganize the elements so that each permutation have an equal chance of showing up

[10:00:54] <RandomReader> vancz - sure, I get exploring this stuff .. but where I was going with the pointer thing is that you still have to deal with lifetime of the pointed-to things, and I'm not sure there's enough in the interface for that to work correctly
[10:00:58] <RandomReader> but it's possible
[10:01:18] <vancz> hm
[10:01:43] <vancz> i think that could be handled in overflow underflow and destruction of the object?
[10:02:00] <vancz> i know the first two can be overridden for streambuf, not sure about the destructor
[10:02:05] <vancz> but it would make sense?
[10:02:15] <vancz> actually shouldnt overflow and underflow be sufficient?
[10:02:23] <vancz> presumably the buffers get flushed on destruct
[10:02:30] <RandomReader> that doesn't cover all the things that interact with char_traits
[10:02:32] <vancz> unless it cant flush for some reason
[10:02:43] <vancz> good point
[10:02:49] <vancz> tunnel vision
[10:02:57] <vancz> it would need to be handled in char_traits
[10:03:05] <vancz> hm
[10:03:24] <RandomReader> Gamah - I don't think I know enough to give you a reasonable direction here
[10:03:59] <vancz> RandomReader: have you looked at https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/libstdc++/2002-08/msg00242.html ? i havent actually gotten around to reading all this stuff i have open now but you might see more in it than me
[10:04:11] <vancz> i dont actually know why nonPOD here is nonconformant
[10:04:14] <Gamah> RandomReader: painfully ironic given your nick
[10:04:19] <RandomReader> but you might look for information on tests of PRNGs, including some of the specific algorithms available (Mersenne Twister will probably show up in most of them, it's popular enough)
[10:04:31] <Gamah> RandomReader: i do appreciate the input tho :)
[10:04:35] <RandomReader> lol aye
[10:05:03] <RandomReader> I have explored this space in the past but right now my head is full of learning an entirely new job, and a lot of the PRNG logic seems to have been pushed out
[10:05:04] <Gamah> it sucks because i'm within "pennies" of where i expect to be... but still also off by a factor o f2
[10:05:04] <vancz> oh hm but they didnt have to deal with the pointer issues because they just tried passing a struct...right
[10:05:17] <Gamah> newjob++
[10:05:18] <RandomReader> so I'm not even remembering the correct terms at this point
[10:05:30] <Gamah> c++ is getting interesting, think i might look into leaving the SQL world
[10:06:00] <RandomReader> ...anyway, the tests should get you into the statistical things people look at, and then you can see what applies to your use case and data sizes, and maybe see what to look for from there
[10:06:14] <RandomReader> and can bring it back to the C++ specific bits afterward
[10:07:34] <vancz> hm. billions.i assume the problem isnt 32 bit numbers getting passed somewhere right?
[10:08:32] <RandomReader> vancz - I think it's because the operations don't handle construction and destruction directly, and assume trivial types
[10:09:10] <RandomReader> I don't know where those assumptions are baked in directly, but all of the standard character types are like that, so it might just be implicit
[10:10:09] <vancz> hm , actually char_traits shouldnt need to handle construction or destruction? it just gives operations for existing data
[10:10:19] <vancz> the data has to come from / goes away somewhere else
[10:10:37] <RandomReader> but copy has the destination already existing
[10:10:38] <vancz> maybe thinking of examples helps, what can i look at other than a stream?

[10:11:05] <RandomReader> traits.copy() I mean
[10:11:07] <RandomReader> that's not how objects in general work, you copy-create them from the beginning, they don't already exist
[10:11:11] <RandomReader> e.g. vector.push_back()
[10:11:39] <RandomReader> so where's the equivalent .append_to_array()? or create_destination_array()?
[10:11:46] <RandomReader> why does it have to exist if we're copying it?
[10:12:08] <RandomReader> this interface doesn't make sense in those generic-object terms
[10:12:49] <RandomReader> it makes more sense if the objects are trivial and so there's no cost to making them exist, no default that has to be set
[10:13:09] <vancz> i dont quite understand. even for the trivial objects youd still have to allocate memory or something to put them in?
[10:13:42] <RandomReader> yes, but then you construct the object in that space
[10:13:55] <RandomReader> you don't have an Object* already around to assign to
[10:14:08] <RandomReader> traits.copy() has   char_type* dest
[10:14:33] <RandomReader> that makes no sense whatsoever, because there can't be a char_type object at the other end of that pointer until one is created
[10:14:58] <RandomReader> for objects in general, you don't create it first and then pass it to a function like this to be assigned, you create it with a parameter of its source from the beginning
[10:15:15] <RandomReader> because creating an object is already an operation, so you want to do it right from the beginning, not waste time with unnecessary things
[10:15:31] <RandomReader> like creating it with some default value, only to change that value afterward with assignment
[10:15:58] <Gamah> vancz: re: billions.... it's 6 decks of cards being shuffled
[10:16:10] <Gamah> or more specifically, a list of 312  inclusive ints
[10:16:37] <vancz> im probably missing your point and will have to reread this, but for copy, wouldnt i just create the object and return the pointer to it?
[10:16:49] <vancz> *allocate / create the object
[10:16:55] <RandomReader> traits.copy() doesn't create anything though
[10:16:57] <vancz> oh wait
[10:17:00] <RandomReader> the dest already exists, it has a pointer to it
[10:17:04] <vancz> im getting the pointer as a parameter
[10:17:06] <RandomReader> right
[10:17:21] <RandomReader> that's why I mean this makes no sense as a general/abstract interface
[10:17:34] <kalven> Gamah: so what is the issue?
[10:17:56] <vancz> im guessing whatever calls copy allocates a sizeofg char_type somewhere?
[10:18:02] <Gamah> kalven: i'm wondering if maybe i'm getting some permutations of the cards more often than others and it's affecting the aggregate results over billions of rounds
[10:18:04] <RandomReader> *trivial* types on the other hand are known to have no cost to creation and destruction, no reasonable default value, no special behavior .. so just making them and assigning afterward isn't an issue, and that kind of assumption might be what's behind the "must be POD" note you found
[10:19:14] <RandomReader> but that also leaves you with no ability to add behavior on construction, like you would with types in general .. unless something else gives you enough hooks in the process
[10:19:22] <vancz> RandomReader: err, i actually need to go look up what POD means _exactly_
[10:19:25] <RandomReader> and I'm not sure char_traits does, this is what you'd end up exploring
[10:19:37] <RandomReader> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/PODType
[10:19:56] <kalven> Gamah: how are you testing it?

[10:20:08] <Gamah> kalven: calling it with a new seed every time
[10:20:13] <vancz> i thought it meant stuff like ints but no structs
[10:20:29] <vancz> i dont think it would be a problem for my token type then if a struct is fine
[10:20:40] <Gamah> kalven: to be fair i could like.... test just the shuffle and hash the result or something and look for colissions i guess....
[10:20:42] <Gamah> maybe later.
[10:21:05] <RandomReader> vancz - it also depends on your members though .. so e.g. a struct { string m; };  would not meet the restrictions
[10:21:06] <kalven> Gamah: I'm asking if you're seeing some statistical anomalies or if these are just theoretical concerns
[10:21:14] <RandomReader> (string is not trivial)

[10:21:29] <Gamah> but i digress

[12:33:13] <lru> vancz: what are you expecting in that line?
[12:33:39] <vancz> i want to match things like ::copy( but not std::copy(
[12:33:51] <vancz> things like           return __gnu_cxx::char_traits<char_type>::copy(__s1, __s2, __n);
[12:34:22] <vancz> (basically im looking for usages of char_traits<>::copy, i suppose an IDE would be easier)
[12:34:38] <lru> well, the first grep returns a filename for any file that contains char_traits anywhere... the second grep knows nothing about char_traits, so you'll only see it by chance
[12:35:40] <lru> maybe something simpler:   grep -r 'char_traits.*::copy'
[12:36:05] <vancz> the point is i looked for files that use char_traits anywhere and then passed those to the second grep to look for usages of copy(  in them (well thats what i did originally, then i switched to ::copy)
[12:36:27] <vancz> because I wasnt sure it would be using char_traits...::copy

[12:38:37] <vancz> the reason i didnt do that is because it isnt necessarily called char_traits
[12:38:44] <Dizidentu> I know what it does and how it works
[12:38:53] <Dizidentu> but I cant c++ syntax it
[12:39:02] <Dizidentu> what is this
[12:39:11] <Dizidentu> static NetSocket *(*_create)();
[12:39:12] <vancz> there's stuff like  _Tr::copy(__outbuf, __get_buf, __nbytes); , though i didnt check if that's actually aliasing char_traits
[12:39:45] <vancz> Dizidentu: a function pointer?
[12:39:48] <Dizidentu> is the first group of paranthesis optional, I dont understand how the syntax pans out
[12:40:07] <Dizidentu> its exactly a function pointer
[12:41:18] <Dizidentu> if I try to google it I find std::function related content and my code base doesnt use any multipurpose lib
[12:41:36] <lru> Dizidentu: _create is (I think) a static function pointer that takes no arguments and returns a NetSocket pointer
[12:41:45] <lru> the parentheses are all required
[12:44:15] <Dizidentu> does the syntax base itself on normal compilation principles or is this one c++ magic?
[12:45:02] <Dizidentu> the (*_create)() seems to have its own predefined meaning
[12:45:02] <lru> it is part of the C and C++ language, so pretty basic
[12:45:17] <Dizidentu> the * I mean
[12:45:17] <vancz> this seems to have sections on pointers to functions https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pointer
[12:45:43] <vancz> yes function pointer syntax is kind of weird

[12:50:39] <Dizidentu> i guess

[12:52:20] <Dizidentu> yeah the second * isnt a simple reference operator(?)
[12:52:20] <RandomReader> the additional parentheses are required to get a pointer-to-function out of that
[12:52:31] <RandomReader> it's not an operator, it's part of the type

[12:55:17] <RandomReader> the parens syntactically separate part of the declaration, to mark the entity (variable name in this case) type from the other components
[12:55:41] <RandomReader> which in the case of a function pointer need to be separated into the return type and the parameter type(s)
[12:56:04] <RandomReader> another case that needs extra parens like this is when forming a pointer-to-array (instead of an array of pointers)

[19:33:00] <sub0> hi. haven't used C++ in half a decade, and don't have C++ compiler installed, but I'm curious about one thing: C++ now seems to have local functors (local struct with operator() defined). can you capture local variables in scope within that operator? additionally, does C++ also have local functions (and can they capture variables in scope?)
[19:36:19] <chozorho> I think lambda expressions can take parameters, if that's what you mean...
[19:36:21] <Zogatribe> sub0: local functions are called lambdas

[23:24:20] <RandomReader> sub0 - a lambda expression is essentially syntactic sugar for creating an anonymous/unknown-name type with members to hold the captures, operator(), constructor, etc .. you can press the play button here to see an example: https://cppinsights.io/s/3cdf0a8d
[23:25:32] <RandomReader> so yes you can do what a lambda does manually, but there's no special language mechanic for "capture" in general, the lambda expression just generates the manual part for you
[23:26:48] <RandomReader> (well, except for a "generic" lambda .. that you can't do manually because a local class cannot contain member templates, so a lambda expression has a special exception there)
[23:27:54] *** Joins: bitmask (~bitmask@c-73-215-237-27.hsd1.nj.comcast.net)
[23:28:03] <bitmask> hey
[23:28:14] <bitmask> ive run into a stupid problem I should know how to fix :P
[23:28:29] <bitmask> for a vector, does it need to be copyable or movable?
[23:28:52] <bitmask> and if the object isnt that, is it best to implement your own operator or just use a vector of smart pointers?
[23:30:04] <RandomReader> you're asking about the T object you store inside a vector? depends on exactly what vector operations you do, but in general, it does need to be move-constructable
[23:30:23] <RandomReader> the question is a bit vague though, what's the problem you're running into?
[23:30:25] <bitmask> yea
[23:30:58] <RandomReader> e.g. whether you implement a move-constructor depends on how your object is supposed to behave, it's not related to vector
[23:31:23] <bitmask> ahh good point, that might be all the info I need
[23:31:41] <bitmask> let me think about that
[23:31:54] <RandomReader> sometimes this is called "type design", it's about making your type support the operations that support whatever abstraction it represents
[23:32:31] <RandomReader> if it's supposed to behave like a number (maybe it's an integer that supports 1000 digits), then of course it should be copyable etc, since people expect numbers to work that way
[23:32:55] <RandomReader> if it's a like a database connection or something, then copying it would be nonsense, so it wouldn't support that
[23:33:37] <bitmask> true
[23:34:34] <RandomReader> you'll also want to follow the "rule of 5" to make sure the operations make sense with each other: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three

[23:37:01] <RandomReader> anyway, vector can support a move-only type, but if it turns out your type is not one that should be movable, then yes you would either need an indirection (pointer) to use a vector, or to use a container that is reference-stable, which is basically list set and map: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container#Iterator_invalidation
[23:37:28] <bitmask> gotcha, thanks for the tips
[23:37:38] <RandomReader> welcome

[23:40:45] <terminalpusher> Is https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order#Relaxed_ordering the fastest ordering for atomic ops?
[23:44:48] <RandomReader> picking the ordering with the least requirements for the job is a good rule of thumb, but actual performance depends on the platform, it doesn't have an abstract answer
