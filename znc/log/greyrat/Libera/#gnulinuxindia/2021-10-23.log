[06:58:58] <Arya[m]> i dont have a vimrc :)
[07:17:23] <gtlsgamr> yOu can Add it to init.vim as well
[07:17:40] <gtlsgamr> Thanks Mudskipper875[m] I will review your PR today when I have time
[07:19:44] <Mudskipper875[m]> <Arya[m]> "i dont have a vimrc :)" <- lol
[07:20:01] <gtlsgamr> Mudskipper: Have you tested the commits?
[07:20:03] <gtlsgamr> On your end?
[07:20:20] <Arya[m]>  i just use vim whenever i have to edit some small file
[07:22:03] <Mudskipper875[m]> gtlsgamr: I haven't tested  .wget-hsts 
[07:22:27] <Mudskipper875[m]> I'll test now and let you know
[07:22:48] <gtlsgamr> I have merged anyway. Test and let me know if it's good.
[07:42:07] <Mudskipper875[m]> <gtlsgamr> "I have merged anyway. Test and..." <- It works
[07:42:33] <gtlsgamr> Are you checking it in your own homedir?
[07:43:07] <Arya[m]> btw i fixed the issues in my PR
[07:43:08] <Arya[m]> tested
[07:43:16] <Mudskipper875[m]> gtlsgamr: Yup
[07:43:41] <gtlsgamr> Mudskipper875[m]: The files in the homedir are being removed as well right?
[07:44:18] <Mudskipper875[m]> If there isn't already a wgetrc file, it creates one for wget-hsts
[07:44:30] <gtlsgamr> No I meant for all other cases
[07:44:58] <Mudskipper875[m]> gtlsgamr: Yeah its all done with the `mv` command
[07:45:10] <gtlsgamr> I'm gonna try it on my own homedir now
[07:45:15] <gtlsgamr> Wish me luck!
[07:45:21] <Mudskipper875[m]> gtlsgamr: Wait
[07:45:29] <gtlsgamr> waiting
[07:45:29] <Arya[m]> Arya[m]: gtlsgamr: this
[07:45:35] <Mudskipper875[m]> Backup ðŸ˜…
[07:45:41] <Mudskipper875[m]> Just in case
[07:46:25] <gtlsgamr> Actually I think we should make this script with such conditions in mind, i.e. making a backup folder that can be used to restore home to previous state
[07:46:32] <gtlsgamr> Let me work on that
[07:46:47] <Arya[m]> yeah
[07:47:01] <Arya[m]> you can put the configs in a backup dir in .cache
[07:47:30] <Arya[m]> so you can do cp -r $HOME/.asoundrc .cache/tidytilde/backup
[07:47:35] <Arya[m]> or something like that
[07:47:42] <Mudskipper875[m]> Also `mv -i` so it doesn't overwrite anything
[07:48:58] <Mudskipper875[m]> I have an idea to make everything a function... let me see if I can do it
[07:49:13] <gtlsgamr> Should I stop my work?
[07:49:24] <Mudskipper875[m]> gtlsgamr: Huh?
[07:49:36] <gtlsgamr> nothing
[12:02:42] <gtlsgamr> test
