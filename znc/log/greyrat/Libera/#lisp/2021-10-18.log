[09:27:09] <holycow> i am looking for some feedback from any lisp programmer that remembers and has used the Lotus Notes / Lotus Domino client server technology

[09:29:02] <holycow> I am familiar with all the critiques of the Lotus suite, but as a sysadmin I am also familiar with the really great features that it had
[09:29:10] <amirouche> I am not very familiar with lotus note
[09:29:20] <holycow> I have written up what I had in mind here: 
[09:29:24] <holycow> https://pastecode.io/s/rvydjpqz

[09:29:38] <amirouche> holycow: do you know the software called `improv`
[09:29:39] <holycow> hi amirouche!
[09:29:50] <holycow> never heard of that actually
[09:30:02] <holycow> link? platform?
[09:30:26] <holycow> Ohhhh
[09:30:30] <holycow> wow that goes way back
[09:30:35] <holycow> no never had a chance to use it
[09:31:17] <amirouche> hmm reading the paste
[09:31:44] <holycow> summary: think django + document oriented application + replication 
[09:31:49] <amirouche> it seems you want to build a rich censor-resistant web-like platform
[09:32:02] <holycow> such that if i had that django app running locally i can subscribe to your server and push / pull changes to the app
[09:32:08] <holycow> bingo
[09:32:26] <amirouche> web-like being that the user can adapt it or even create their own apps
[09:32:32] <holycow> bingo
[09:32:37] <amirouche> so it is unrelated to improv
[09:32:41] <holycow> bingo
[09:33:14] <holycow> the lotus part is incidental to lotus notes / domino actually having created this solution in the 80s
[09:33:19] <holycow> ti was originally created for cia
[09:33:33] <holycow> their agents needed to work all around the world, store the data locally and have it encrypted
[09:33:37] <amirouche> lotus note is something like microsoft access, isn't ?
[09:33:48] <holycow> and, when they could, dial in to cia servers andupload / download document changes
[09:34:20] <holycow> although notes / domino ran full document oreinted apps, similar to say wikipedia or threaded forums and such
[09:34:34] <amirouche> I mean if you know microsoft access (a database + visual basic + possibly networked) how lotus note is different?
[09:34:38] <holycow> one of the application built on notes was an email client correct
[09:34:49] <holycow> the email application was just a document oriented database
[09:34:57] <amirouche> good you mention database
[09:35:03] <holycow> because email is just a straight document oriented application
[09:35:48] <holycow> lotus notes stored / could read write to a local database.  the database was document oriented and hierarchical.  from the file system perspective it was just one file.
[09:36:05] <holycow> but the database actually store all of the source code for your application and the application date
[09:36:13] <holycow> all the source code and your data was versioned
[09:36:17] <amirouche> so to summarize my opinion and experience, you should look for a rich set of data or database-like primitives on top of Distributed-Hash-Table, with publish-subscribe and crypto signatures
[09:36:23] <holycow> git before git in a single database file like sqlite
[09:36:43] <amirouche> such as the database from some kind of user is the network
[09:37:02] <holycow> i was thinking lisp + clog + sqlite
[09:37:03] <amirouche> I did start a SRFI about that
[09:37:06] <amirouche> yes
[09:37:20] <amirouche> it can be done with lisp clog and sqlite
[09:37:45] <amirouche> but you still need to go beyond the original low-level key-value get and set of the kademlia dht
[09:38:04] <holycow> do you have any opinions on how much work with would take to create a document oriented "spec" for creating apps and then creating a replication mechanism?
[09:38:07] <holycow> so for example
[09:38:17] <holycow> lets say you wanted to create wikipedia or a forum
[09:38:43] <holycow> both are document oriented applications but the input fields, data stored and relationships between each documents are deifferent
[09:39:05] <holycow> but you need version each document and then replicate out the changes to whomever subscribes.  or vice versa
[09:39:06] <amirouche> here is food for thought about the networked database layer: https://github.com/pre-srfi/peer-to-peer#specification
[09:40:05] <holycow> i have never seen this before
[09:40:08] <amirouche> because of the two general problem, aka. unreliable network, you can't have a mongodb public interface as-is on top the network.
[09:40:42] <amirouche> two general problem, sybil attack and various other problem in publicly distributed networks
[09:41:08] <holycow> right. reading.
[09:41:20] <amirouche> yes you can version the "documents" and "link" them
[09:41:55] <holycow> oh this is your project
[09:42:11] <holycow> this is an area you find interesting?
[09:42:21] <amirouche> yes
[09:42:28] <holycow> huh
[09:42:45] <amirouche> by the way, I would be doing you and the other a disfavor not to mention libp2p work https://libp2p.io/
[09:43:08] <amirouche> also there is someone on #lispcafe working  on a p2p framework with CL
[09:43:17] <holycow> really?
[09:43:18] <holycow> huh
[09:43:24] <amirouche> yes
[09:43:34] <amirouche> p2p distributed object system
[09:43:34] <holycow> well i have been trying to wrap my head around the problem
[09:43:42] <amirouche> there is even a recorded talk somewhere
[09:43:47] <holycow> because there are sooooooooooo many people already kinda doing some aspect of this
[09:43:55] <amirouche> yes
[09:44:07] <holycow> ultimately i though that either it is a monolithic project all done in one language like common lisp
[09:44:21] <amirouche> lot of javascript lib / projects, there is also opendht part of jami, there is gnunet, possibly others?
[09:44:27] <holycow> or it is going to end up as a hodge podge of technologies andyou are going to have to stick them in a vm and publish the vm
[09:44:43] <amirouche> hm
[09:45:01] <holycow> my thought was to just narrow everything down to the "document" and see if a single binary could be published.
[09:45:10] <amirouche> you mean like interop existing libs and deliver the end-user application you wnat?
[09:45:16] <amirouche> would result in a large vm
[09:45:23] <holycow> this single binary would be basically the server, the client would be the browser and your editor could be whatever ide you want
[09:45:31] <amirouche> yes sure
[09:45:37] <holycow> right precisely.
[09:45:46] <holycow> so we live in a sea of amazing technological options.
[09:45:54] <holycow> wait a week and there is a new javascript framework out
[09:45:56] <holycow> i cant even keep up
[09:46:14] <holycow> and all of these projects are great in their own way.  i love them all in some way.  i'm a fan
[09:46:21] <amirouche> that you have a good idea of where you want to go, if you have a good grasp of CL, and after asking #lispcafe, do a prototype
[09:46:43] <holycow> but i also run enterprise environments and i know what it means to run server farms and complexity
[09:47:18] <holycow> before i gothere, how are they writing a related project?
[09:47:34] <holycow> or why? i thought they were just genreal chat?  
[09:47:43] <amirouche> sure, you need to know existing practices and what is the state of the art.
[09:48:23] <holycow> let me ask you this question, since you know way more than i do
[09:48:47] <holycow> if you needed a budget for x number of devs for y number of years or whatever
[09:48:51] *** Quits: amb007 (~a_bakic@23.184.126.78.rev.sfr.net) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[09:48:54] <holycow> purely speculative
[09:49:04] <amirouche> holycow: I asked the maintainer of the CL project called `netfarm` some input document, here are links: https://zenodo.org/record/4712699 and https://gitlab.com/cal-coop/netfarm
[09:49:13] <amirouche> I am listening / reading...
[09:49:18] <amirouche> what is the question?
[09:49:36] <holycow> if it was common lisp + clog + sqlite and the simplest possible document oriented  application ...
[09:49:53] <holycow> say something like a todo list ... say a threaded todo list.  a proto forum
[09:50:00] <amirouche> yes?
[09:50:06] *** Joins: amb007 (~a_bakic@199.37.22.93.rev.sfr.net)
[09:50:15] <amirouche> the question is how much human time it would take ?
[09:50:33] <holycow> how much time + full time programmers might you need to create an mvp (minimum viable product)
[09:50:45] <holycow> just a demo, lots of breakage.
[09:50:47] <holycow> ?
[09:51:09] <holycow> i'm handwaving here because just trying to get a blip on the radar. 
[09:51:16] <holycow> reading
[09:51:19] <holycow> thanks for the links
[09:51:57] <holycow> oh wow, i see you know a heck of a lot about this.  those are really intersting links
[09:52:34] <holycow> thank you so much for those, i am reading.
[09:53:16] <amirouche> I can tell you how much time it can take to build a prototype, it took me two weeks: https://git.sr.ht/~amirouche/qadom
[09:53:51] <holycow> wow, you already built something like this
[09:53:56] <holycow> well actually
[09:54:11] <holycow> the only difference between qadom and what i am thinking about is the offlien storage
[09:54:16] <holycow> you build something live
[09:54:25] <amirouche> regarding the mvp, I can not say, it depends on the perimeter, whether you have experts in network (hole punching etc...) whether you rely on existing systems (sqlite, netfarm), and whether you have upfront a good grasp of the MvP feature set (again)
[09:54:53] <amirouche> holycow: it also work offline, there is database replicating the p2p-network database
[09:55:00] <holycow> i'm only envisioning people creating things and popping online to publish whenever and subscribers can subscribe whenever.  if we can publish via onion over torrent, people can just subscribe to a torrent node.
[09:55:16] <holycow> what?
[09:55:17] <amirouche> but it is meant to work online nonetheless (you can schedule a publication in the prototype)
[09:55:21] <holycow> wow cool
[09:55:51] <amirouche> you can NOT schedule a publication sorry, but yeah, it can work in theory offline
[09:56:01] <amirouche> you can NOT with the  published code.
[09:56:41] <holycow> je parler francais un peti peu
[09:56:43] <amirouche> sadly, there is not single point of coordination for such efforts
[09:56:43] <holycow> hehone sec
[09:57:13] <holycow> the reason that i am asking is that is my skillset
[09:57:24] <amirouche> I mean a place where to share and exchange ideas about specifically an alternative platform to the web that is publicly distributed
[09:57:32] <holycow> i need to understand the domain better, and then seek funding
[09:57:46] <amirouche> then go ahead :)
[09:57:58] <amirouche> I can't tell you how much time it will take you to do the work
[09:58:08] <holycow> amirouche well, if we had replicationcapability to your software
[09:58:10] <holycow> :)
[09:58:14] <amirouche> I can't tell myself, how much time it would take me to do MY work.
[09:58:25] <holycow> iknow, but you already built something close
[09:58:54] <amirouche> then it can be a 20-day work thing to prototype
[09:58:57] <holycow> which kind of gives me a ballpark way to think about what something like this would need in terms of resources
[09:59:19] <holycow> oh, i see.  you misunderstood.  you are thinking in terms of accureate projections
[09:59:24] <holycow> i'm thinking from the funders perspective
[09:59:32] <holycow> they need to know is it one guy working full time for a year
[09:59:38] <holycow> or 10 guys working full time for a year
[09:59:41] <amirouche> look at libp2p then
[09:59:52] <amirouche> they go fund, those are the people behind ipfs
[10:00:12] <holycow> oh i seee
[10:00:22] <amirouche> there is also a w3c thingy iirc called: webrtc or something
[10:00:23] <holycow> man, love this channel.  you guys know everything
