[02:47:38] <EvilDMP> I have a generic class-based view, DetailView(generic.DetailView) that works as expected, except when I try to reverse it.

[02:47:56] <EvilDMP> Then I get a NoReverseMatch.
[02:48:27] <EvilDMP> The URL pattern is path('<slug:slug>/', views.DetailView.as_view(), name='detail')
[02:49:36] <EvilDMP> I'd expect reverse('detail') to hit it (even if it doesn't return anything useful, I don't expect it to tell me "Reverse for 'events.views.DetailView.as_view' not found")
[02:50:59] <EvilDMP> To be precise: "'detail' is not a valid view function or pattern name"
[02:51:18] <EvilDMP> Why is it not a valid name?
[02:52:03] <GinFuyou> This reverse doesn't match pattern, so it not epxected to work

[02:58:09] <EvilDMP> GinFuyou: I realise it doesn't work, what I am failing to understand is why.
[02:58:52] <GinFuyou> because pattern says it requires a slug
[03:00:13] <GinFuyou> you may add another pattern without it. But then detail view will fail, though I don't remember if it 404 or a "real" error
[03:02:32] <EvilDMP> OK, fair enough. However I have another pattern, path('', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index')
[03:02:32] <EvilDMP>  
[03:02:44] <EvilDMP> No slug required.
[03:02:59] <EvilDMP> And reverse('index') fails in the same way.

[10:08:11] <node1> Hi
[10:13:15] <node1> Is there anyway we could develop django using CI/CD?
[10:14:13] <dodo> sure
[10:19:35] <node1> dodo, I'm using github as repository. But i'm confused which CI/CD application i should integreate.
[10:19:42] <node1> Could you please help me in out.
[10:19:59] <dodo> you asked in so many channels, not sure where to answer
[10:20:45] <node1> dodo, Yes because i want to get the right answer. :)
[10:21:42] <dodo> i don't really use github
[10:21:50] <node1> While setting CICD these 5 pricipal must it govern 1.speed 2.agility 3.reliability  4.confidentiality 5.Customizeable
[10:22:00] <dodo> generally speaking, ci and cd are different things and can be implemented with different tools
[10:22:52] <node1> I always avoid using tools in my project because they are not reliable in terms of security. I' always prefer programatical approach and least used 3rd party tools
[10:23:25] <node1> If github has server side feature for automation like any hooks
[10:23:26] *** Joins: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras)
[10:23:29] <node1> then i should welcome it
[10:24:10] <dodo> github has workflows
[10:24:53] <node1> Which one? Does it has any server side hooks?

[10:27:31] <FunkyBob> however, I would, given the choice, use circle-ci for my CI
[10:30:21] <node1> FunkyBob, Why you choose circle-ci? when it can be done with git hooks?
[10:33:53] <FunkyBob> i've set up testing with circle ci
[10:34:01] <FunkyBob> I've set up testing with github workflows
[10:34:05] <FunkyBob> I choose circle ci
[10:34:12] <FunkyBob> it works, it's easy, it's well documented
[10:34:29] <FunkyBob> i got some basic stuff working with github.. and, sure, it hooks into the PRs more cleanly...
[10:34:37] <Tykling> does it require 30 commits of fiddling with yaml files to get it running
[10:34:38] <FunkyBob> but... some stuff was just too shittily documented to use
[10:34:48] <FunkyBob> also, it doesn't use real yaml

[15:11:50] <T-101> if you want to add, say... ngrok, you would add ".ngrok.io" in to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list
[15:21:13] <jp___> i tried spelling out the ip as well
[15:21:22] <jp___> [xx.xx.xx.xx]
[15:21:43] <jp___> i was thinking maybe because its aws it needs different permissions or i dunno
[15:21:50] <jp___> but i still get the error
[15:22:45] *** Quits: vdamewood (~vdamewood@fedora/vdamewood) (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[15:24:24] <jp___> in any case it works on the local machine, but the cloud version is giving me the exception
[15:24:43] <T-101> ip number must be inside quotationmarks
[15:24:52] <jp___> I thought wildcards worked because i've seen some comments on stackexchange
[15:25:03] <jp___> @t-101 yeah
[15:25:18] <jp___> @T-101
[15:25:26] <jp___> T-101: yeah
[15:25:33] <jp___> uggghhhh forgot my commands
[15:25:54] <jp___> but yes, the ip numer is within single qoutation marks
[15:27:21] *** Joins: vdamewood (~vdamewood@fedora/vdamewood)
[15:27:44] <T-101> also if you are running django in docker, django might interpret your ip as starting with 172.
[15:28:52] <jp___> i am running django in docker
[15:29:00] <jp___> so that means what exactly?
[15:29:38] <jp___> adding 172.168.1.1 as host?
[15:30:49] <jp___> or the docker interface i get from ifconfig
[15:33:22] <jp___> neither of those work :(
[15:33:58] <jp___> ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['3.9.117.0', 'ec2-3-9-117-0.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com', '172.168.1.1', '172.17.0.1']
[15:34:07] <jp___> nvalid HTTP_HOST header: '3.9.117.0:8000'. You may need to add '3.9.117.0' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
[15:37:10] *** Quits: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[15:37:14] <FunkyBob> jp___: what web server do you have in front of your WSGI server?
[15:37:19] <FunkyBob> and which WSGI server?
[15:37:30] <jp___> web server?
[15:37:34] <FunkyBob> yes
[15:37:44] <jp___> whatever django comes with
[15:37:48] <FunkyBob> when you deploy django, you put it behnd a web server which serves your media and static files
[15:37:55] <FunkyBob> django doesn't come with a web server
[15:38:00] <jp___> fuuuuuuu
[15:38:09] <FunkyBob> it's in the deploy instructions
[15:38:16] <jp___> so it was just luck it worked locally
[15:38:27] <FunkyBob> depends on what you mean by "locally"
[15:38:37] <jp___> localhost / 127.0.0.1
[15:38:39] <FunkyBob> the dev server will serve static files for you
[15:38:51] <FunkyBob> but "manage.py runserver" is not something you use in production
[15:39:14] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[15:40:46] <FunkyBob> jp___: were  you trying to go to production, using runserver?
[15:41:14] <jp___> nah, this is just a python job offer test
[15:41:52] <jp___> was supposed to keep it pure python, but decided to include django, containerization and aws deploymeny in my code
[15:41:59] <jp___> maybe i get a better offer
[15:42:45] <jp___> so manage.py runserver does have a webserver built in that serves static files
[15:42:52] <jp___> shouldnt that also work on aws?
[15:43:01] <FunkyBob> not if you set DEBUG=False
[15:43:23] <FunkyBob> it would work, yes...
[15:43:53] <FunkyBob> as for your allowed hosts issues.... why don't you know the desiired public name of your server?
[15:44:10] <jp___> desired public name?
[15:44:36] <jp___> it's just an ec2 instance i fired up for this project
[15:44:42] <jp___> figured using the ip was enough
[15:45:14] <FunkyBob> yes... the name you want people to be putting into their browser to reach this site
[15:45:30] <FunkyBob> the IP will be enough, if t hat's all you ever want people to put into their browser
[15:46:01] <jp___> the only one who will review this is the person who validates my code
[15:46:09] <jp___> but if its free i can do it
[15:46:17] <jp___> but it sounds like registering a domain?
[15:46:20] <jp___> or ...
[15:46:32] <FunkyBob> no... just whatever the browser passes in the Host: header
[15:47:34] <jp___> like 'webiste.com' ?
[15:47:42] <jp___> and it finds it on aws?
[15:50:38] <jp___> nevermind that
[15:50:57] <jp___> it doesn't woork on aws either with debug=True or False
[15:51:20] <jp___> ip is still seen as disallowed host
[15:51:21] <FunkyBob> define "doesn't work"
[15:51:39] <FunkyBob> it's not about what its private IP is.. it's about what address the BROWSER thinks it's talking to
[15:51:46] <jp___> so when i run on my dev machine docker-compose up my app runs smoothly
[15:52:04] <jp___> FunkyBob: so the public address?
[15:52:12] <jp___> or how can i verify what address that is
[15:52:54] <jp___> I think since the browser gives back the error, it means it reached the django app so it is communicating with the right ip
[15:53:14] <jp___> so it says: Invalid HTTP_HOST header: '3.9.117.0:8000'. You may need to add '3.9.117.0' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
[15:53:14] <FunkyBob> what URL did you put into the browser?
[15:53:30] <jp___> http://3.9.117.0/App
[15:53:36] <FunkyBob> ok, so, diid you add that to allowed hosts?
[15:53:41] <jp___> yes\

[21:43:53] <Matthias1> Hello! I have a `TextField` with a `max_length=140`, that gets translated by a ModelForm into a `textarea` with a `maxlength=140`
[21:44:50] <Matthias1> My issue is that new-lines on the client are treated as 1 character, but are received as 2 characters. This is not desirable.
[21:45:52] <Matthias1> I had hoped that Django would, as part of the un-encoding of the form data, also convert these line-endings to match my system, but this is not the case, at least by default.
