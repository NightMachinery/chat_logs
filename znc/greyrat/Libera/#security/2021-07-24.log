[17:13:09] <rudi_s> bewees: If they are connected on L2 they can connect each other host on the same L2 when the guess/know the networks.
[17:14:16] <rudi_s> So it's a good idea to use separate bridges for separate networks (not only for security but also as general good practice).
[17:14:50] <rudi_s> Now, if ARP spoofing on the same L2 is a problem or not depends on the scenario. L3 is more robust in that regard.
[17:15:04] <rudi_s> *but also more complex to setup
[17:15:33] <rudi_s> If the VMs serve "common" servies (like SSH, HTTPS, etc.) then ARP-Spoofing is not much of an issue as all important connections are secured by the protocols anyway.
[17:16:53] <rudi_s> And what Apach<tab> mentioned is of course also an issue. Hypervisors have bugs so skilled attackers may escape their VM. So having very important machines on the same physical host as other hosts might be problematic. Again, depends on your attacker model and what kind of service you're running.
[17:17:05] *** Joins: Roey (~Roey@user/Roey)
[17:17:45] <rudi_s> An external firewall may help in that regard. But won't do much good if the problematic scenario is one VM attacking another (as the firewall is then not involved unless all traffic is routed over it).
[17:18:30] <rudi_s> But unless you have a very specific threat in mind, I'd use one bridge per network and attach all VMs to their bridges.
[17:19:16] <bewees> rudi_s: Oh that summed it up for me, thanks!
[17:20:11] <rudi_s> np
[17:20:28] <bewees> So I just create multiple bridges on different VLANs of the host NIC
[17:21:10] <rudi_s> Yeah. Btw. be careful with native/untagged VLANs. Depending on the setup they might get passed to all bridges. So best use only tagged VLANs on the host NIC.
[17:21:31] <bewees> I still wonder why QubesOS decided to use tap point to point devices, then complicately uses iptables between the VMs, maybe this gives amore filigran iptables based decision on top of each guests firewall?

[17:23:37] <bewees> I think the advantage is the mentioned filigran iptables decisions on host basis plus a centralized entity to enforced policies
[17:24:12] <bewees> I will have to see how easily I can set this up with tap devices on KVM/QEMU or maybe XCP-ng. I think in KVM/QEMU it might be easier
[17:25:32] <rudi_s> Well, separate L2 domains prevent any kind of "unexpected" L2 communication and prevents each VM from directly interacting with any other VM. It also makes (IP-) filtering between VMs possible.]
[17:26:37] <bewees> I see, and if the setup isn't much more difficult I maybe should try that too :-)

[21:13:39] <rudi_s> BillyZane: Ah, 1000 MBit/s ;-) - almost anything will work then. I guess even a Raspberry Pi can do (almost) 1GBit/s.
[21:14:43] <rudi_s> *and it has no Intel ME and it can do VLANs. Only needs a switch which supports VLANs and you have a simple router for your home network.
[21:15:04] <flyback> im not sure about that rudi_s
[21:15:18] <flyback> routing might be a little much espically when you add wireguard
[21:15:49] <flyback> defintely want a rpi4 cause the older ones use usb nics

[21:19:56] <rudi_s> Haven't tested it. Maybe 1G is too much, but 500MBit or so should work fine, even with Wireguard (which is quite lightweight).
[21:20:10] <rudi_s> But there are many cheap boards to choose from.

[21:31:37] <menace> facebook also uses it
[21:32:16] <flyback> yeah since all the ryzen boards have usb 3 assuming any are supported by coreboot, usb 3 debug mode is a lot simpler than usb 2.0 was
[21:32:21] <flyback> just needs a crossover cable
[21:32:30] <flyback> uses a usb port as if it was a serial port
[21:32:43] <flyback> so you can attach with a laptop and that box never needs a head

[21:41:49] <flyback> you can get really creative too
[21:41:58] <flyback> like hard coding secondary boot sources
[21:42:13] <flyback> so if say the boot drive failed you could have it automaticaly try to pull from a nfs share etc
[21:42:32] <cryptikulous> this board works well with libreboot https://libreboot.org/docs/hardware/ga-g41m-es2l.html
[21:42:56] <flyback> core2
[21:42:57] <cryptikulous> nothing fancy heh
[21:43:00] <cryptikulous> ik
[21:43:04] <flyback> should have decent routing performance

[21:44:10] <quantum_> How is a socks5 proxy different?
[21:44:20] <quantum_> I have one set up on port 8081 and on Konqueror browser which supports socks, it loads text but not pictures.
[21:44:32] <flyback> heh
[21:44:38] <quantum_> On Vivaldi which only supports a proxy by prepending with --proxy-server I get nothing, presumably because it only supports https proxies.
[21:44:52] <flyback> I love how gigabyte touts their dual bios solution as being patented and all special
[21:45:06] <flyback> alll they did was tie 2 bios chips together except for chip_enable
