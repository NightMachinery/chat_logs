[02:01:53] <powerofzero> Hello. I am trying to mount an ntfs partition on a vhdx image, and my searching online keeps pointing me to guestmount/guestfs. However, I have not gotten any of those tools to work.

Added MODULES=(i915 nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm) to try intel , and video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080@60:D as kernel
[04:07:10] <krabador> parameter, but nothing. I tried video=eDP-1:d too on both , but nothing. How can i set HDMI as video output on boot ?

[11:20:53] <bony> When installing archlinux with full encryption I choose LVM on LUKS and kept a separate partition for efi. Now in the "Preparing the disk" section of there is a Tip: which says "UEFI systems can use the EFI system partition for /boot." So I did not create a separate partition for boot. Now after I have installed the system I see that boot folder is in /boot. I think it should be in /efi/boot. I am a bit confused on how to proceed further. I am following 
[11:20:53] <bony> this guide https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system under LVM on LUKS.

[11:39:14] <randomxusr> Is it possible to encrypt the /esp ? or does that have to be unencrypted, in order to launch initramfs and unlock the encrypted part? and is the kernel tamper proof?
[11:39:47] <thursdaylark> well, that's actually how you encrypt your kernel
[11:40:19] <thursdaylark> by keeping it off the esp, and using a bootloader that is capable of unlocking the disk where the kernel resides before booting to it
[11:40:34] <nl6720> the ESP itself can't be encrypted, unless you're thinking of self-encrypting drives

[12:04:16] <phrik> Title: Archlinux ISO download via BitTorrent / Installation / Arch Linux Forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
[12:04:16] <mpan> You know you can download the file directly from a mirror?
[12:04:22] <susi> check that last answer
[12:04:38] <Erus_Iluvatar> yup, although i don't really care that it does : i'm mainly using it to seed
[12:05:08] <Erus_Iluvatar> mpan: yes, i'm just trying to fix what i had automated
[12:05:16] <nl6720> AFAIK the only difference between the magnet and .torrent is that the .torrent has webseeds
[12:05:19] <mpan> You may download it from mirror and overwrite the file downloaded by the torrent client, if only the client can perform re-check. if it can, it will detect the file is complete and will happily seed it.

[14:49:02] <grawity> rotating keys is useless
[14:49:11] <grawity> the same ssh-rsa keys can be used to make both sha1-based and sha256-based signatures
[14:49:16] <Foxboron> right
[14:49:37] <grawity> what you'd need is an sshd that supports the extra negotiation that was added for rsa signature algorithms

[14:50:05] <grawity> either that or switch to ecdsa, IIRC openssh gained ecdsa support a bit earlier

[14:52:55] <grawity> reenabling sha1 support is not a big deal, these are challenge/response signatures that are only relevant once, not something long-term like signing a whole certificate
[14:53:37] <grawity> but 6.6 should have support for ecdsa keys which already were specified to use sha256 for signing

[18:24:19] <raster> though reality is it uses mounts to mount the file as a filesystem then run stuff from there and choose libs from that mounted fs (use fuse). the appimage at the start of the file is an elf binary that launches and does the dirty work. it's a bit like ye olde gzexe that preprended a small shell script that extracted the binary to a tmp file then ran it...

[18:25:21] <raster> the downside of all these solutions (appimage, snap, etc.) is they avoid using your system libs and thus may have old versions or it leads to sometimes odd behavior - often with themes/fonts etc.
