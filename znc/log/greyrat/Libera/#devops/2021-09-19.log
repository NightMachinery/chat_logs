[02:12:37] <rawtaz> Dus10: how will ansible remove a file that you added for some configuration or whatever unless you explicitly tell it to remove that file when you no longer want it?
[02:12:52] <rawtaz> (just to take an example ottomh)
[02:15:47] <rawtaz> perhaps you meant that you have a "default" that tells ansible to remove that file, and you add this default as well as an addition of the file initially.
[02:16:02] <rawtaz> even if that is the case, it leaves a lot of cruft around in your ansible code

[03:28:16] <Dus10> rawtaz: I understand that Ansible can't do taht
[03:28:20] <Dus10> I am not suggesting it can
[03:28:25] <Dus10> it doesn't have a state
[03:28:30] <Dus10> if it had state, it could
[03:28:51] <Dus10> I am simply talking about the configuration of services
[03:34:53] <rawtaz> right, so what you were talking about only works for part of the things one normally does with ansible
[03:35:08] <rawtaz> i just wanted to understand what you meant, wasnt trying to dismiss it :)
[03:35:17] <rawtaz> in that case i think nix would be better. but it's less mainstream :)
