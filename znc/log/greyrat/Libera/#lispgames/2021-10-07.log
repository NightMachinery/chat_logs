[16:12:42] <borodust> sm2n: it took me two days to compile a lot of foreign libraries alien-works depend on
[16:13:17] <borodust> mostly figuring out build errors as i'm not very versed in C++ tools
[16:14:12] <borodust> Duuqnd: it's available through custom quicklisp dist
[16:14:43] <borodust> Duuqnd: here are the instructions https://github.com/borodust/alien-works-demo#quicklisp
[16:14:56] <Duuqnd> Yeah, I saw your tweet mentioning it
[16:15:12] <borodust> ah, gotcha
[16:15:24] <sm2n> oh
[16:15:29] <borodust> Duuqnd: did you try stunning it up?
[16:15:31] <Duuqnd> I tested it a few minutes ago and it seems to start up fine at first, but no window opened. It did play a sound though.
[16:15:40] <borodust> *spinning
[16:15:57] <borodust> Duuqnd: woops, interesting
[16:17:08] <borodust> Duuqnd: win10? anything in repl/*inferior-lisp*?
[16:17:33] <borodust> what (uiop:implementation-identifier) reports?
[16:18:23] <Duuqnd> Implementation identifier: "sbcl-2.0.0-win-x64". It printed out things that seemed normal and got to the point where it printed out "Looping" in the REPL. It played a sound and then stayed like that.
[16:18:33] <Duuqnd> (Yes, I'm on Windows 10)
[16:18:36] <borodust> i see
[16:18:52] <borodust> just in case, try ccl 1.12 or latest sbcl
[16:19:24] <borodust> https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/download/v1.12/ccl-1.12-windowsx86.zip
[16:19:26] <borodust> or
[16:20:02] <Duuqnd> I'll try that at some point but right now I don't want to deal with installing things.
[16:20:25] <borodust> https://github.com/roswell/sbcl_bin/releases/download/2.1.9/sbcl-2.1.9-x86-64-windows-binary.msi
[16:20:39] <borodust> for ccl it just unpacking
[16:20:56] <borodust> but i understand, thanks a lot for checking!
[16:21:08] <Duuqnd> Also, I tried again just now and the same thing happens. No window, and it stops doing anything after the sound has played. I checked the inferior-lisp buffer and yup, there's a lot of error messages there.
[16:21:52] <borodust> ohhhh
[16:21:56] <Duuqnd> Actually it's just the same one over and over
[16:22:14] <borodust> what is it?
[16:22:55] <Duuqnd> It's showing a big C function definition but at the end it says "reason: wglMakeCurrent() failed"
[16:23:03] <Duuqnd> Actually it's a C++ function
[16:23:12] <Duuqnd> "filament::PlatformWGL::makeCurrent"
[16:23:16] <borodust> hmm, i see
[16:23:33] <borodust> does your GPU support opengl 4.1?
[16:23:40] <Duuqnd> Yes, it should
[16:23:48] <Duuqnd> I'll double check though
[16:24:12] <borodust> well if its looping then it should be fully intialized
[16:24:24] <borodust> incl GL context
[16:24:31] <Duuqnd> It's worth noting that the error message didn't come just once, it kept being printed over and over and now I have about 50000 lines of it
[16:24:54] <borodust> yeh, reported each frame prolly
[16:28:28] <Duuqnd> Looks like my computer should support OpenGL 4.1
[16:28:53] <borodust> o7
[16:29:08] <borodust> ill look into ways to repro this

[16:55:10] <borodust> Duuqnd, btw, what is your CPU model?
[16:55:39] <Duuqnd> I'm not sure, I just know it's some Intel. I'll check what exactly it is.
[16:55:47] <borodust> tnx
[16:56:40] <Duuqnd> It's an Intel Core i5-8265U
[16:56:54] <Duuqnd> The computer is a laptop so I'm using the integrated graphics
[16:57:08] <Duuqnd> Although it still should work with GL 4.1
[17:01:41] <borodust> yup, should work
