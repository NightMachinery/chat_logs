[01:08:04] <hexnewbie> lovetruth: I think uptime is measured from early some point in the kernel initialization, since it's the kernel provides the boot time to get it calculated.
[01:08:08] <[[R]]> eqw: example...
[01:08:32] <hexnewbie> ‘man proc’ only calls it ‘boot time’
[01:09:01] <lovetruth> hexnewbie, that is what I thought too :) ... and when you said that about initramfs you gave me hope that I can achieve a lot less time in the booting process :)

[01:11:29] <rascul> lovetruth it depends a lot on the initramfs and what you need it to do, and i can't tell you the first thing about it because i don't have your initramfs on your hardware
[01:12:04] <Thomas25> I found the culprit, nvidia module tried to insert itself periodically with started all sorts of problems, i removed it completely and it seems the problem is gone or much more mild. is monolithic nature of linux kernel makes it impossible for module insertion to be non blocking?

[04:40:57] <pnbeast> That's not how compression algorithms usually work, Elw3.  Remove one of the files and make it a symbolic link, maybe?  I'm not sure how zip, per se, handles links.

[08:59:56] <mlu> very little you can do if you're targeted and within physical reach
[09:00:07] <mlu> but if you're not, TLS is plenty good, in theroy
[09:00:16] <ravan> pnbeast, that is true. because the initial source and the final destination is in the onion core!
[09:00:29] <mlu> i.e. if I was plotting against North Korea, I'd probably just use an email account hosted by a German ISP

[09:02:10] <mlu> they're a global company that wants to make a profit
[09:02:16] <mlu> it depends on your threat model
[09:02:17] <pnbeast> Exactly.
[09:02:26] <ZombieChicken> yep. By any means nessesary
[09:02:38] <mlu> if it's plotting a government overthrow, a commercial company not based in the country you're targeting is usually a decent bet

[09:11:19] <tarel2> Sheep , I know its not easy to write a drive for wifi. Still you pay people to build you a deck on your house. Why not a driver?
[09:12:00] <sheep> tarel2: because the driver likely requires a lot of reverse engineering and possibly using proprietary firmware
[09:13:05] <ZombieChicken> You certainly could pay someone to build a wifi driver for you. The question is how many tens of grands do you have laying about to pay for it, and how high quality you want the driver to be
[09:13:42] <sheep> most recent wifi devices have drivers by the original manufacturer so you wouldn't need to commission a developer
[09:14:10] <ZombieChicken> Or, y'know, try and get a SDR that runs in the microwave range to talk to your router
[09:14:21] <Sauvin> What's an SDR?

[13:50:02] <Sauvin> I wouldn't be surprised to learn of phones that accidently went into the oven or the dishwasher or the laundry machine, either.
[13:50:18] <Sauvin> Let's not speculate.

[13:51:17] <gry> its last sign of life was black screen and shining light
[13:51:18] <Sauvin> Yeah, I sometimes see these girls wearing pants with tiny pockets lugging around these HUGE honking phones in them.
[13:51:32] <gry> it was nokia 8110 4g, a reasonably small banana phone
[13:51:39] <spyroboy> not really a girls thing.
[13:51:58] <spyroboy> broken and lost phones are really an everyone thing.

[15:38:28] <NGC3982> it's usage will be to inspect image backups for security cameras
[15:38:51] <tirnanog> I mean, it's not as intelligent as the windows file manager but the thumbnailing seems to be vastly quicker.

[15:39:24] <NGC3982> thanks
[15:39:30] <NGC3982> i shall return crying or cheering
[15:39:34] <tirnanog> another issue is that the userspace implementation of smb/cifs is honestly, really slow compared to windows.

[15:45:50] <tirnanog> anyway, maybe you can use a file manager that renders it tolerable.

[19:05:43] <mikebutash> Dagmar: same here, same problem with lvm's over time moving around
[19:05:58] <jessicara> once the thrashing begins and everything slows to a crawl, i think i'd rather it was fast
[19:06:05] <Dagmar> I have not seen LVM try looking inside my logical volumes for physical volumes since
[19:06:24] <Dagmar> I've got a cron job checking that stuff every hour on my primary vmhost
[19:06:26] <jessicara> guess is up to the user to decide if they can afford to replace ssds quicker
[19:06:47] <Dagmar> Having >20Tb of storage start mapping itself inside-out will make you paranoid
[19:06:48] <tirnanog> jessicara: it's not even true, though. swap can improve performance in some cases. the reason is that anyonmously mapped pages are locked in RAM otherwise, irrespective of whether they are being frequently used or not. this is a unique characteristic of swap that apples, no matter the quantity of physical RAM.

[19:08:13] <jessicara> i haven't read it yet
[19:08:14] <tirnanog> jessicara: program mallocs whatever quantity of memory then proceeds to use barely any of it and/or use it very infrequently. without swap, these memory pages - which are anonymously mapped pages - are stuck in RAM no matter what.
[19:08:18] <jessicara> although the title sounds familiar
[19:08:33] <jessicara> yeah they are
[19:08:42] <tirnanog> with swap, some of those can be paged out to swap, making more RAM available for the allocation of pages that are being frequently used.
[19:08:44] <EdFletcher> you should, it has a good discussion of all of this: https://chrisdown.name/2018/01/02/in-defence-of-swap.html
[19:08:44] <farkaan> EdFletcher: Yeah i encountered it a few years ago and been using 1gb of swap on my installations ever since
[19:08:48] <tirnanog> no matter how much RAM you have, that is true.
[19:08:56] <hodapp> this looks like a decent article
[19:08:56] <EdFletcher> farkaan: good call
[19:09:24] <jessicara> yeah, i don't get it
[19:09:34] <farkaan> what was the rule for low ram machines? double the ram swap size?
[19:09:35] <EdFletcher> it's very well-written and -reasoned, and lays the case out nicely. i don't even bother explaining it myself anymore, just point people at this post.
[19:09:36] <mikebutash> I tend to keep my partitions minimal to use, and break things out like root, /var, /var/log, /usr, /home, etc, and occasionally I have to grow them.
[19:09:37] <jessicara> unless ram is scarce, it sounds more like it just would add delays
[19:10:06] <tirnanog> jessicara: you can surely understand that statistically, not all mapped pages are called upon with equal regularity across all the programs that are running on your system?
[19:10:11] <Dagmar> Having swap does not induce delays

[19:10:52] <Dagmar> The Linux kernel is perfectly capable of schlepping things out to disk for it's own reasons without interfering with whatever disk access requriments user jobs have
[19:11:06] <Dagmar> jessicara: Try 20
[19:11:09] <jessicara> generally my experience is it would swap out whatever firefox tab are using and i'd have to wait half a minute to switch tab
[19:11:19] <jessicara> then get rid of swap and it's fine
[19:11:28] <farkaan> lower swappiness to 15 maybe?

[19:15:16] <mikebutash> they all use a metric ass-ton of ram
[19:15:16] <farkaan> mikebutash: What does that do?
[19:15:21] <jessicara> was thinking 2.4 times onwards
[19:15:34] <farkaan> Yeah it's very recent
[19:15:35] <jessicara> since then, no swap
[19:15:38] <mikebutash> after 5 minutes or whatever you set it to, it'll suspend the usage of the tab

[21:35:13] <treefrob> I have used nouveau every day, all day, for 3 years and it works fine for me
[21:35:14] <msiism> I mean: bc -l <<< "l(8)/l(2)"
[21:35:39] <treefrob> I was so happy to get away from the proprietary nvidia driver
[21:35:56] <msiism> mikebutash: The problem is not nouveau (pun intended), it's NVidia.
[21:36:22] <rendar> msiism, yes, it could be, but nouveau is not a solution to that problem, it adds more problems
[21:36:30] <treefrob> just anecdotal evidence of course, but your experience is not my experience
[21:36:46] <msiism> rendar: How so?
[21:36:46] <peetaur> treefrob: I used nouveau lots in the past...and suffered; sometimes one gpu would work fine, and another failed (crash, or overheat and eventually crash no matter how cool you keep it other ways); sometimes one xorg version was ok and other failed; some things never worked reliably...like kdenlive startup can still crash the driver when it's an otherwise ok setup; now I just avoid it completely
[21:37:09] <msiism> Well, it is reverse-engineered, is it not?
[21:37:10] <mikebutash> oh I know, doesn't mean it being present isn't more harm than good at times, especially when trying to boot on a system with a gpu it's not entirely good with.
[21:37:24] <peetaur> I had one nvidia gpu where windows 7 would hang but linux ran it fine :D  (didn't use it enough to say if it worked with xorg updates, etc.)

[21:42:15] <tirnanog> uwharrie: perhaps not to the extent that one might hope for. the defined behaviour depends on whether a given implementation is XSI conforming or not. in particular, bash is not XSI-comforming unless xpg_echo is set. it's not, by default.
[21:42:22] <rendar> msiism, if you say so, comments wouldn't agree with you :)
[21:42:24] <treefrob> "everything works fine there" has got to be one of the most unqualified statements I've heard in a while

[22:49:33] <Psi-Jack> Well I'm thinking, I have two internet providers at the condo I'm living at now. One from the community which is only 50Mbit, and my usual COX which is 1Gbit. The 50Mbit is a good backup and fairly decent for dedicated video streaming.

[22:53:21] <tirnanog> jason1234: if it doesn't, it would be because you have some service that automatically saves the rules upon shutdown.
[22:53:32] <tirnanog> jason1234: regardless, iptables -F FORWARD will undo the change.

[23:07:19] <Gustavo6046> say something that analyzes a Java program and chops away parts where heap, garbage-collectible objects can be replaced with temporary stack structs, or their heap overhead minified through the use of arena allocation (so as to improve the efficiency of garbage collection and of individual runtime allocations).

[23:09:03] <Gustavo6046> Say I often create many objects of a class UsefulThing that I use a lot for whatever it is it's useful for. They have some functionality and serve as an useful and tidy interface, and help promote DRY. In theory, instead of allocating and GCing many of them, I could allocate a single arena in heap and use that to speedily create and destroy many of them, and the arena itself would be accountable to garbage collection all at once by whatever
[23:09:03] <Gustavo6046> objects use the UsefulThings in it.
[23:09:15] <Gustavo6046> ananke, this is only an example though. The ideas I have are way more general
[23:09:35] <akk> object-orientedness seems like a different question than stack vs heap
[23:09:58] <Gustavo6046> That is true, but a lot of the overhead in OOP comes from the way data is handled internally.
[23:10:30] *** Quits: deavmi (~tbk@user/deavmi) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:10:31] <akk> that's sounding again like a language-specific question
[23:10:39] <Gustavo6046> A virtual machine that is mindful of OOP and tailor-made for it can be fast, but a virtual machine that executes procedurally and for which OOP code is transpiled in a way that reduces the overhead of OOP where applicable, could be even faster.

Object-oriented programming is not very JIT friendly, and much of its overhead lies in allocation and strong memory ownership (or lack thereof), which are affairs JIT can seldom, if at all, ameliorate.
