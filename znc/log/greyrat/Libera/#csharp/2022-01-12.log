[10:41:53] <JakeSays> i recommend starting with a creality ender 3 v2 for ~$200
[10:41:56] *** Parts: __that__ (~Guest8@139.47.36.37) ()
[10:42:37] <JakeSays> you're going to want to launch it out a window a couple of times but if you get past that, you'll have a lot of fun
[10:42:54] <Inge> My friend picked up a Prusa and is very happy with it
[10:43:09] <JakeSays> those are at the low end of expensive
[10:44:42] <Inge> Pruse is more like $750
[10:44:51] <JakeSays> not the ones i've seen
[10:44:59] <JakeSays> that's in the less cheap range
[10:45:29] <ki9a> JakeSays: !
[10:45:36] <JakeSays> !!
[10:45:43] <Inge> bang bang
[10:45:44] <ki9a> You do 3d printing?
[10:45:46] <MatthiasVance> Ohh $200 is indeed cheap
[10:45:56] <MatthiasVance> Is there anything like double that price that has A LOT better results / less work for me?
[10:45:58] <JakeSays> ki9a: constantly
[10:46:03] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: no
[10:46:20] <Inge> If you DO go for a Prusa, getting it pre-assembled will make it a lot easier to get started
[10:46:27] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: that's the thing - the effort doesn't get less until you start paying for it
[10:47:07] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: also $200 will get you really good results
[10:47:11] <JakeSays> after the pain period
[10:48:18] <MatthiasVance> That's a good price point to try things out
[10:48:35] <JakeSays> it is
[10:48:52] <JakeSays> but if you want to spend 3x, this is a good one too: https://amz.run/5Di1
[10:48:56] <MatthiasVance> Never seen a company state "It's far from perfect" on their own website xD
[10:49:16] <JakeSays> lol
[10:49:28] <JakeSays> ender 7 is a good one also and it's fast
[10:49:39] <MatthiasVance> So basically anything Creality?
[10:49:55] <ki9a> at some point I wanted to buy a reprap
[10:49:58] <ki9a> but figured
[10:50:02] <ki9a> wth will I do with it?
[10:50:05] <ki9a> So then I didn't.
[10:50:22] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: yeah basically. creality is supposedly the largest 3d printer in the world
[10:50:52] <Inge> Naomi Wu @sexycyborg has a bunch of reviews of Creality stuff
[10:50:59] <JakeSays> it's not the best, but their printers are functional
[10:51:01] <MatthiasVance> This is going to be like when I told my g/f I would buy a printer and then ended up with a huge A3 model
[10:51:33] <JakeSays> Inge: yeah that woman makes things hard to focus on
[10:53:29] <Inge> LOL

[11:21:14] <Nasp> Twice the size og A4
[11:22:13] <Inge> MatthiasVance: I picked up a tank printer, and have been making A4 prints with complete abandon. will definitely print A3 and A3+ but needed to get to know it first

[15:50:05] <ap5> But i think it is fine to use both still

[16:19:51] <jmer> To be fair, the keyboard wasn't really "broken" just one of the nobs that would keep it down and tightly in place was broken or bent... So one corner would be a little loose giving of "klack klack" sounds when pressed

[16:41:24] <jmer> also I haven't gotten to "late game" yet xD
[16:41:30] <irwiss> and development is slow af, NPCs were removed, and then there's like 5 or 6 years that they're on the "todo" list
[16:42:02] <irwiss> mods are a bit useless because the good ones take ages to update, the modding community is a bit weak
[16:42:48] <jmer> irwiss: but I agree those are valid critisisms...
[16:43:20] <irwiss> if you're interested in deep zombie survival game check out CDDA, it's not arcade style, but system depth is pretty great
[16:43:41] <irwiss> there's graphical mods to make it pretty, or you can play in ascii via ssh
[16:43:51] <jmer> irwiss: I was just waiting on PZ to get multiplayer support... The experience of cooperating with friends on surviving a hard game is very pleasant to me
[16:45:06] <irwiss> yeah that's a benefit, mp communities are often what keeps a game running
[16:45:25] <jmer> CDDA does look interesting though
[16:45:43] <jmer> As I get older I gravitate toward games with depth... Too many games are too samey imho
[16:47:44] <jmer> irwiss: do you know other games in this genre/niche?
[16:47:53] <irwiss> i recommend CDDA if you like roguelites, there's SDL frontends with graphics or ascii... it's turn based roguelite, and has a pretty good mid game and fair endgame (endgame can be vastly improved with mods)
[16:48:14] <jmer> I need to feed the beast of my brothers else I end up playing even more modded minecraft and there's a certain limit to how much modded minecraft I can stomach xD

[16:49:44] <irwiss> heh, if genre is zombie game, rather than specifically top down my friends and i enjoyed back4blood - it's similar to left4dead, can give a challenge on higher difficulties too, and world war z is also fairly nice
[16:49:52] <irwiss> both are on xbox game pass btw
[16:50:05] <jmer> I never saw the appeal in left4dead
[16:50:08] <jmer> I found it a lazy shooter
[16:50:12] <jmer> that got samey in 10 mins
[16:50:37] <irwiss> it's more of a team challenge game on higher difficulty, especially when specials require team mates to support each other
[16:50:38] <jmer> I bought world war z and played it until I found out the weapons you find in lvl 1 doesn't carry over to lvl2

[18:13:26] <EternalMan> well the feeling about odata in the team is that certain big name websites have dropped support for it in their api's, so we shouldn't use it. I keep saying we should just use graphql but apparently we've got to have a rest api

[22:26:46] <MaNa2k> lz_, lol did you fall for the megapixel scam
[22:27:06] <MaNa2k> its all about the size of the sensor
[22:27:48] <MaNa2k> i read somewhere that 6megapixels should be more then enough for most people, that was like 15years ago  i think
[22:28:04] <_Shurik_> my damn phone is taking better pictures then Canon Rebel T7...
[22:28:46] <MaNa2k> _Shurik_, hmm, thats not that bad camera. are you on auto settings or something ?
[22:29:42] <MaNa2k> and do you understand how  apeture, shutterspeed, and iso work, and their balance to each other
[22:29:45] <_Shurik_> MaNa2k: no, I have a shitty kit lens
[22:29:59] <_Shurik_> I need to upgrade it
[22:30:12] <MaNa2k> _Shurik_, ah i see. Well you should still be able to get fairly ok pictures with kit lenses
[22:30:21] <_Shurik_> I do have 50mm F1.8 one, but no zoom
[22:30:25] <MaNa2k> you need to take a starter course on how to shoot with dslr
[22:30:27] <_Shurik_> that limits what I can do
[22:30:39] <lz_> _Shurik_: a xiaomi
[22:30:47] <_Shurik_> MaNa2k: yeah, I definitely should
[22:30:48] <Inge> dlr with kit lens was probably why most parents reverted away from dslr's
[22:30:50] <MaNa2k> _Shurik_, thats actualyl a nice lense for portraits
[22:30:59] <lz_> MaNa2k: I actually need the pixels; it's just that the phone does some awful post processing on it
[22:31:05] <_Shurik_> MaNa2k: oh yeah, it's sensitivity is sick
[22:31:16] <MaNa2k> i got same from nikon 50mm but F1.4

[22:32:12] <_Shurik_> I'd like to get 24-70mm F2.8
[22:32:56] <MaNa2k> i also got a 300mm-70mm sigma lense, damn nice zoom on it.
[22:33:09] <_Shurik_> My ex had 70-200mm F2.8  Very very nice

[22:33:44] <_Shurik_> I have that
[22:33:52] <MaNa2k> cool
[22:34:16] <MaNa2k> lighroom is probably the only program adobe made thats actually not crap.

[22:34:28] <_Shurik_> Oh come on, Photoshop is amazeballs
[22:34:56] <_Shurik_> I really really tried using Gimp and then just said fuck it and purchased Adobe membership
[22:35:42] <lz_> gimp is such a joke lol
[22:36:18] <lz_> its source code made me puke in my mouth
[22:38:55] <lz_> the build instructions for windows are basically "get fucked"
[22:39:28] <_Shurik_> Haven't looked at the code, but UX is total shit

[22:45:52] <jonp> you're getting 64 megapixels.  you're also getting "computational photography"
[22:46:13] <jonp> the phone system uses 4 "sub-pixels" to produce a better pixel for the 16megapixel image
[22:46:19] <lz_> wanna look at what the "64mp" look like?
[22:46:23] <jonp> the camera is *really* noisy as it is
[22:46:28] <lz_> it's not even decent in 16mp

[22:47:31] <MaNa2k> is that focused ?
[22:47:38] <lz_> yes
[22:47:50] <lz_> I took a subset of the image but it looks like that at 1x
[22:47:57] <MichaelLong> oof
[22:48:01] <lz_> it's actually zoomed out

[22:49:45] <MichaelLong> lz_, there's not free return policy?
[22:49:57] <lz_> no; I should have bought it online
[22:50:02] <MichaelLong> exactly
[22:50:42] <MaNa2k> lz_, just tell em somethings wrong with the camera, and return it and say you want something else
[22:52:16] <MichaelLong> didn't expect that such quality is being sold in higher end phone (which I would categorize a note 9 in), I had the impression most of the better phones are more than good enough
[22:55:13] <lz_> pictures taken with gcam are much better; can't get 64mp though
[22:56:07] <lz_> had to install a dodgy apk
[22:56:41] <MichaelLong> forgive me the question (I'm not a camera expert), what is a 'gcam'?
[22:56:53] <lz_> it's google camera; the software for google pixel phones

[22:58:13] <lz_> here's a side by side comparison : https://i.imgur.com/gO5rxWI.png
[22:58:22] <lz_> left is gcam, right is native xiaomi phone app
[22:58:26] <lz_> same zoom level
[22:58:29] <MatthiasVance> wait
[22:58:32] <MatthiasVance> that's the same subject?

[22:58:37] <lz_> yes, right?
[22:59:10] <MatthiasVance> Wow yeah
[23:02:27] <lz_> my guess would be they process the image so that people's skin look nice
[23:02:33] <lz_> because that's what customers would test anyway
[23:03:48] <lz_> right is actually the "64 mp mode"; I think the native app can give results similar to gcam without it
[23:04:12] <MatthiasVance> I was going to say image quality is *not* about the amount of pixels
[23:04:57] <lz_> I don't want to manually stitch pictures :(
[23:05:14] <MatthiasVance> What, no of course not
[23:05:44] <MatthiasVance> There's 12MP in the iPhone 13 Pro and it takes beautiful photos
[23:05:46] <lz_> I wanted to get 4k textures at least, can't even get that
[23:06:24] <MatthiasVance> 12MP is enough to get 4K..
[23:06:37] <lz_> I mean 4kx4k
[23:06:40] <MatthiasVance> oh
[23:07:12] <lz_> gcam is still significantly better even in "normal" mode
