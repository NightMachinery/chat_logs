[01:01:24] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[01:05:06] <Roey> hihi o/
[01:05:28] <Joanna> Hi roey
[01:09:35] <Joanna> I was reading the discussion I missed about security. With respect to what lts said about sacrificing security for speedy response I think it would be better to address the problems that are causing emergency calls to begin with. For thousands of years people have relied upon their neighbors who were often relatives for help rather that calling some dispassionate stranger at the other end of a phone line.

[01:15:14] <Joanna> Nobody ever asks how we got into this predicament nor wants to do anything about it. The trend of neighborhoods full of people who neither know nor care about each other is the biggest security threat of all.

[04:14:58] <jan6> Joanna: there's actually some "neighbor watch" initiatives around some places, which is literally just your usual neighbourly people keeping an eye out for suspicious stuff
[04:15:45] <jan6> I didn't know it's a thing in US too, but apparently it is, at least in some places, https://www.nnw.org/
[04:16:16] <jan6> this version seems more focused on reporting to police or whatnot
[04:17:44] <jan6> but over here, it's more focused on basically just calling each other like "hey, did you know there's a suspicious dude in a dark hoodie loitering around your house for the last hour?"
[04:18:52] <jan6> probably doing both tbh
[04:19:16] <jan6> but my point is that the entire point of such projects is to care about each other
[04:19:18] <jan6> ;P

[16:12:51] <Joanna> jan6: neighborhood watch still relies upon callings strangers at the other end of a phone line rather than solving problems directly. The way that buildings in a neighborhood hare arranged and designed can definitely discourage crime if done properly. As referenced in the book about defensible space in the topic.
[16:14:47] <Joanna> Criminals tend to prefer architecture which makes it hard to have witnesses.
[16:18:50] <jan6> duh
[16:19:45] <Joanna> Actually the architecture determines if people have a sense of ownership of the areas around their homes.
[16:20:35] <Joanna> Sometimes all it takes is a short wall showing that the space belongs to the homes nearby as part of their yards.
[16:21:21] <Joanna> It’s psychological really.
[16:22:14] <Joanna> In general too many strangers make it hard to know who belongs there and who doesn’t

[19:36:47] <jan6> night vision stuff is cool, and here the guy shows how to "kind of purge" air using basically-pure-argon wine preserver (plus how to assemble) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSumk0HeNqc
[19:44:25] <elkclone> gah, more js. I dislike js. :-/
[19:59:39] <jan6> where? youtube? use invidious?
[20:04:42] <elkclone> ah no I am just wading into a js session in prep for a 'blockchain' project. 
[20:05:35] <elkclone> well as soon as I can stop being distracted by my cool hacky python scripts. lol
[20:08:01] <elkclone> the other day, while taking a break from js hell. I was half watching depressing american news stream. then I be like fuck this I can find a alt news collection somewhere and ah.. few lines of python later I have a simple script that makes a api call to a news alt search micro service and poof have a bunch of headlines I can look up and enjoy. :D 
[20:08:42] <elkclone> it's so cool in fact I am now considering jamming it to github. :D
[20:09:44] <elkclone> you can select country and category. 
[20:10:35] <elkclone> https://newsakmi.com/news/science/gravitational-waves-should-permanently-distort-spacetime/
[20:11:01] <elkclone> is one from today. I never would have read/heard about this from big news media . 
[20:11:10] <elkclone> for example. 
[20:13:58] <jan6> heh
[20:14:25] <jan6> pretty cool
[20:18:41] <jan6> and you can always put ANYTHING up, however minor, which is exactly why I love acme.com, dude has put up tiny and useless-to-most programs, but also great ones, and some of them are pretty unique or useful, such as an "overlay" program, or simple http test programs, or several tiny http servers, or a batch proccessing command that lets you run files with X extention through some filter, and end up
[20:18:42] <jan6> with Y extention (such as copy backup files, or convert .png into .gif, or whatever)
[20:19:30] <jan6> some are pure dupes too, like "reverse lines" or "highlight grep's results"
[20:19:55] <elkclone> is this your site?
[20:20:04] <elkclone> or just a repo you use. ?
[20:22:39] <jan6> what's a repo?
[20:22:49] <jan6> acme.com is probably older than I am, lol
[20:22:53] <jan6> yes
[20:22:57] <jan6> definitely older than I am
[20:23:56] <jan6> I should really organize my stuff around, and put that up somewhere, too
[20:26:01] <jan6> I have some less-useful shell script fun, I've made, generally posix, stuff like "read one byte of input at a time" function (since it's a pain in the A), and based on that, simple arrow-key manipulateable volume/brightness control, and a list scroller (could be made into a whole menu system), and cobbled together dependency checker, and whatnots
