[12:05:12] <kuribas> I find a nice appartment with garden, in my price range.
[12:05:19] <kuribas> However it's near a canal.
[12:05:28] <kuribas> I wonder if that makes it a risk for flooding in the future.
[12:05:39] <kuribas> It's not in a current flooding zone, but near one...
[12:09:54] <kuribas> Should I take the risk, or look further?
[12:10:21] <kuribas> I just wonder if the value of the property will be reduced to 0 in 20 years...
[12:10:22] <dminuoso> You can insure against that risk.
[12:11:14] <kuribas> dminuoso: I could insure not, but if the flooding zone expands, then wouldn't the insurance retract later?
[12:11:22] <kuribas> s/not/now/
[12:12:09] <dminuoso> That would depend on the details of your insurance.
[12:12:52] <dminuoso> So talk to your insurance agent.
[12:13:23] <dminuoso> It's going to be difficult to quantify the risks here, it's exactly insurances that have that quantIfied.

[12:27:43] <dminuoso> What country is this in?
[12:27:53] <kuribas> Belgium.
[12:28:03] <dminuoso> No idea about belgian prices, but I know about belgian chocolate.
[12:29:21] <kuribas> not beer? :-P
[12:29:42] <dminuoso> I buy craft beer from small and micro breweries.
[12:30:10] <dminuoso> So I dont believe in these "national pride stories" of some big <insert country> beer company.
[12:31:29] <kuribas> We have small breweries too :)
[12:31:43] <dminuoso> Sure, but they likely dont do anything differently from our small breweries.
[12:32:33] <dminuoso> The notion of "belgian beer" only makes sense in the context of these large popular breweries
[12:33:00] <kuribas> I don't think so.  It makes sense in the large variaty of tasteful beers.
[12:33:05] <dminuoso> Say common popular american beer is watery as heck, but you can get as decent craft beer in the USA as you can here.
[12:33:13] <kuribas> You're not confusing belgium beers with dutch "heineken"?
[12:33:32] <dminuoso> kuribas: take my US example
[12:33:36] <dminuoso> and say with the US heineken
[12:33:53] <dminuoso> Let's for the sake of argument say that US Heineken is typical "american beer"
[12:34:06] <dminuoso> There might be other large popular american brands that taste similarly
[12:34:21] <dminuoso> They are a reflection of what the broad popular likes
[12:34:27] <dminuoso> *population
[12:34:59] <dminuoso> And there's a huge difference between that US heineken and the German Becks
[12:35:06] <dminuoso> But the microbreweries are not, and Im not convinced that US microbreweries do things much different from say German microbreweries
[12:35:29] <kuribas> I don't know, I am not a beer expert.
[12:36:19] <dminuoso> It's just my personal experience, as Ive been trying out a lot of different craft beers
[12:37:27] <kuribas> And you didn't try belgian beers?
[12:38:32] <dminuoso> Of course I did
[12:40:16] <kuribas> +
[12:41:20] <kuribas> anyway, I don't feel like a beer flame war this morning...
[12:41:54] <dminuoso> Beer doesnt even burn.

[23:07:39] <geekosaur> I think my main problem with that is that there is a lot of knowledge locked up in a C paradigm, which can be done in Haskell but won't be as good as either the C version or one that is done in a Haskell paradigm

[23:08:15] <jijimofo> yeah rt
[23:09:18] <jijimofo> yeah i agree that is going to be a problem. right now my thinking is to refactor it once i get the haskell code 
[23:09:30] <geekosaur> which is why we usually wrap a C version via the FFI and then make a Haskelly wrapper for that
[23:10:32] <jijimofo> that is the easier way. i want more automation and more language support. c, c++, and python
[23:11:02] <geekosaur> otherwise it's usually easier to start out implementing it in a Haskell way from the start, blindly translating C to Haskell as the first step just seems like it'd make it harder because it's hard to directly keep relationships to comments, sometimes identifiers, etc.
[23:11:55] <geekosaur> not that it's impossible: "ctangle" from TeX translates Knuth's Pascal to C on the fly
[23:12:47] <geekosaur> but then it's not really intended for reading, whereas you want to use it as a first step to writing proper Haskell code
[23:13:38] <jijimofo> much of my thinking is intuitive at the moment. i have a vague idea that something is possible but to really nail it down i need to make a concrete implementation
[23:15:57] <jijimofo> that is a good point about readability. perhaps in the beginning it will just be translated and then i could do a refactoring tool to assist in making it more haskelly
[23:17:53] <jijimofo> honestly i think what i really want is a way to specify the implicit knowledge. i would like to come up with a machine-processable way of explaining why things are done
[23:18:58] <jijimofo> it would be more valuable for freetype to be written in one language that could be used by others to generate an implementaion than it is to just have an implementation in one language
[23:19:46] <jijimofo> but not a full-fledged nlp program. hence my idea of algebraic specifications
