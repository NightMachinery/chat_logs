[08:49:01] <TinoDidriksen> gde35, indeed, group by will reduce the result set to one of each in the group set. If you want all of the same value together, then you want order by.

[12:12:37] <delboy1978uk> morning o/
[12:16:39] <fakuve> Morning peeps
[12:18:38] <Pall> good morning
[12:19:53] <fakuve> So a quick question, (no need to be really explanatory) , yesterday we have been seen the folder structure of a project , separated by `/bin /classes /config /docs /public /resource /test` , but now I'm seeing this `symhpony` projects and I can see in most of their repos `/assets /content /data-sources /fields /lang /lib /utilties` , is this directory structure specific to this certain project , or is a standard
[12:19:55] <fakuve> way of organizing resources as well? , I guess this would all go into `/src`
[12:20:07] <fakuve> https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/datetime
[12:20:47] <TinoDidriksen> There is no standard layout.
[12:21:07] <fakuve> Well but more or less aiming to one
[12:22:22] <TinoDidriksen> I think the closest we get is that Composer creates a vendor/ folder. Everything else is whatever the author feels like, or whatever framework the project uses.
[12:22:24] <Naktibalda> what is symphony?
[12:23:37] <fakuve> TinoDidriksen: well there are some agreements I guess , https://tommcfarlin.com/the-assets-directory/
[12:23:48] <fakuve> Naktibalda: no idea , is just a project I guess
[12:24:17] <TinoDidriksen> Hm. I've never seen/noticed an assets/ folder before.
[12:25:20] <Naktibalda> fakuve: that datatime library is a bad example, I doubt you will find any good practices in it
[12:26:34] <fakuve> Naktibalda: oks
[12:27:11] <Naktibalda> it looks like code from pre-framework days of PHP 15+ years ago.
[12:36:24] <fakuve> I guess if `assets` is defined as "CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts". they could all go to `/public`
[12:37:24] <biberu> you'll probably have a build step for your public resources
[12:38:07] <biberu> so no :)
[12:38:15] <fakuve> :D
[12:40:33] <biberu> even if you for some inexplicable reason write js manually you'd probably want to build it for your target browsers, tree shake it, minify etc, and you may have e.g. images and fonts that aren't in use (and that shouldn't be publicaly available yet)

[13:36:16] <fakuve> I have on there the directory structure plus the code of the files
[13:37:09] <fakuve> I should be easy peazy , but `Uncaught Error: Class "MyWeb\Pepe" not found ... Stack trace: #0 {main}`
[13:38:41] <AllenJB> Have you run composer dump-autoload since changing composer.json to add the PSR-4 autoload entry?
[13:39:08] <fakuve> yep I did `composer dump-autoload -o``
[13:40:38] <fakuve> I'm gonna delete vendor and do it again
[13:40:49] <Naktibalda> rename file to Pepe.php autoloader is case-sensitive
[13:42:07] <fakuve> Naktibalda: nah , still not working
[13:42:49] <Naktibalda> fix namespace name in composer.json too
[13:43:38] <fakuve> oooook
[13:43:56] <fakuve> `s/myWeb/MyWeb/`
[13:44:01] <fakuve> Cheers Naktibalda !
[13:46:23] <AllenJB> Aside: You've added a ?> to the end of pepe.php - you should avoid doing that. Whitespace (newlines or spaces) after a PHP closing tag can cause issues (headers must be sent before any output, including whitespace). You should only use ?> in view files (when you actually have something to output after your PHP code)
[13:51:14] <fakuve> AllenJB: oks I will cheers!
[13:51:36] <fakuve> meaning I will not use closing ?> :D

[16:48:42] <__adrian> fakuve: disabling allow_url_fopen is almost always the best choice
[16:49:03] <__adrian> you should generally not write code which relies on it being allowed - it can lead to unexpected security issues
[16:49:40] <__adrian> if you need to access a remote url, use a dedicated http client (e.g., guzzle)
[16:53:01] <fakuve> thanks I will keep thatone for the future __adrian
[16:56:37] <fakuve> Silly question , why when using `fgets()` it kind of reads one byte less? I'm missing the string encoding or something? `fgets($handle, 3);` I got `Hello World` it reads `He`
[16:57:06] <fakuve> in ASCII that should be 2 bytes I guess

[18:19:41] <fakuve> Hi sorry guys , I have been messing a bit with this and cannot figure it out. When using `require_once '../subdirectory/file'` how many subdirectories can you go up in the Path ? I'm trying `require_once '../../subdirectory/file'` but it looks like is not getting parsed properly
[18:22:07] <AllenJB> You can go all the way to the filesystem root (and do funky things like "../directory/../other-dir/". What exact behavior are you seeing (what does "not getting parsed properly" mean)?

[18:31:20] <__adrian> fakuve: i would guess you're not requiring the file you think you are
[18:31:30] <__adrian> very strongly recommend you do not use unqualified paths
[18:32:53] <__adrian> if you do, you need to _check_ what the working directory is, and know you're O.K. with whatever the include_oath is on the particular server

[18:42:12] <__adrian> what do you intend your path to be relative _to_?
[18:42:29] <fakuve> So mainly let me show you the project
[18:42:33] <__adrian> e.g., do you intend to be relative to the directory that particular php file is in?
[18:42:59] <fakuve> https://termbin.com/o9ch
[18:43:48] <fakuve> The problem I have in here is that the autoloader is in other subdirectory that is not descendant of the files
[18:44:07] *** Joins: freeman_h (~Ume@80.209.149.171)
[18:44:18] <__adrian> what file is your  require  statement in

[18:44:54] <fakuve> in src/includes/calc.inc.php
[18:45:10] <__adrian> ...in both files?
[18:45:25] <fakuve> oh yeah , mistake there
[18:46:05] <fakuve> it should be only in the one that calls the rest of them , isnt it? then ./public/index.php
[18:46:16] <Naktibalda> fakuve: why are you learning from 20 years old tutorial? nobody names their files .inc.php
[18:46:44] <freeman_h> Hi all, how can I get the current path that a piece of coding is running? in my example is it in Home/code/project/Package/api-package/provider.php however has this is a package which will be pull in using composer it will end up in the vendor directory so I cannot hard core the path.
[18:47:01] <__adrian> yeah, you should absolutely not have directories like classes/ and includes/ or fileanmes like .class.php or .inc.php
[18:47:27] <fakuve> ok
[18:47:29] <Naktibalda> freeman_h: __DIR__ gives directory of that file
[18:47:35] <__adrian> ^
[18:47:51] <__adrian> so if you intend to be relative to the directory that particular php file is in, use __DIR__
[18:48:24] <__adrian> the other common use case is if you want to require a file relative to your project's root, in which case you'd define a const like PORJECT_ROOT and use that.
[18:48:34] <freeman_h> ffs thanks Naktibalda
[18:49:11] <__adrian> unqualified, php looks in the cwd, then on the include_path
[18:49:35] <__adrian> this is extra complication and uncertainty that no one really needs  ;)

[20:42:55] <znf> If you'd have to sign something that has to be decoded by a Cloudflare worker (js), what would you use?
[20:43:38] <znf> ie: I need to create a token of some sorts that includes an expiration date (unix timestamp) from PHP that will later be checked by a Cloudflare worker
[20:43:55] <znf> I need the actual message, not a hash to verify
[20:45:05] <znf> or, hm, granted, I could also use a hash and pass the expiration date in plaintext... but if I'm passing some long argument...
[20:48:35] <nebx_co> 3.
[20:48:45] <__adrian> you don't want verification?
[20:48:45] <nebx_co> typo.. sorry
[20:49:57] <__adrian> there are standard formats for stuff like this. JWTs, for example.
[20:51:15] <znf> yeah, was looking at JWT right now
[20:51:40] <znf> __adrian, I meant I don't just need a hash to verify, I need to pass the encrypted message
[20:51:47] <znf> but JWT seems the proper way to do it
[20:52:12] <znf> JWT seems to check all the boxes :P
[20:52:15] <__adrian> just use an established library (on both ends) that doesn't allow "none" as the crypto
[20:54:41] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[20:55:30] <__adrian> hi
[20:55:39] <znf> seems this is the prefered way https://github.com/lcobucci/jwt
[20:57:48] <__adrian> that seems to allow "no algo," i would not use it
[20:58:42] <Rockwood> any good in mobile's app development?
[20:58:42] <__adrian> double-check that you can specify the algo to use when decoding (that you don't simply read the JWT and use whatever it specifies)
