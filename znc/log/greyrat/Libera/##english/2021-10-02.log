[01:06:44] <StayHungry> GuiToris: the word 'sometime' is more appropriate in this sentence (you hope to see her one day in the future), 'sometimes' is also possible, but implies multiple occasions (you hope to see her from time to time, let's say, every Christmas)
[01:07:37] <GuiToris> come on, why did you write 'sometime'?
[01:07:47] <GuiToris> you said it was 'some time'
[01:07:57] <huf> sometimes it's some time
[01:08:01] <huf> like when you need some time

[01:08:38] <GuiToris> is this right?
[01:09:40] <GuiToris> ahhh, I don't know
[01:10:16] <GuiToris> sometime: 'at a time in the future or in the past, although you do not know exactly when'
[01:10:31] <GuiToris> is it a single word then?
[01:10:41] <StayHungry> GuiToris: some time is an expression = a while (e.g. he need some time to clear his head, she wants to enjoy some time with her family, it hasn't been to the vet for some time.), sometime is an adverb or adjective = unspecified time (e.g. we should meet sometime soon, it happened sometime last month.)
[01:10:55] <StayHungry> *he needs
[01:11:27] <GuiToris> so it's 'I hope we meet sometime'
[01:12:08] * GuiToris is waiting for confirmation

[05:26:01] <kurahaupo> I wonder if capitalising "I" became the standard not because people thought themselves important, but rather because they were lazy, in the same way that people write "u" instead of "you". Before typewriters and computers, it was faster & easier to write "I" than "i" because you didn't need to make a dot. 
[05:27:16] <pussipupu> I think more because lower case I before cases got lost easily
[05:27:54] <LjL> The origin of the popular identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in confusion between the Latin words mālum (an apple) and mălum (an evil), each of which is normally written malum.[39]
[05:28:28] <pussipupu> LjL: I guess it comes down partly to the things the fruits developed to attract
[05:28:30] <LjL> kurahaupo, as far as i've read it was because "i" was somewhat problematic, especially before dotting it became standard

[05:29:53] <LjL> although i guess that's the story of "i" in general, not specifically of the pronoun I, since it is dotted *because* things got confusing without the dot (which itself comes from the same Latin sign that became the acute accent ´ which was used to mark long vowels originally)

[05:32:49] <LjL> Wikipedia says the domesticated apple comes from somewhere that is now China. doesn't mention the bear theory. if the human domestication theory is correct and also the fact it mentions the term for "apple" in antiquity was used as a bit of a blanket term for all "foreign fruits"... i wonder... people tell me that edible fruits are *vastly* more varied and tasty in SE Asia, and apparently the ones that are most widespread in Europe... also come from there? :P
[05:34:39] <pussipupu> well, my confidence level was "I heard a fun idea" to be fair
[05:36:33] <LjL> yeah i'm not specifically contesting it
[05:36:52] <LjL> just assuming it's not the main route by which modern apples reached us, idly wondering why all our fruit comes from Asia

[11:08:15] <huf> isnt it trendy for people in wealthy countries to adopt children from violence-torn third world shitholes? :D
[11:08:15] <iridium__> pussipupu: i think we can all agree that the best documentation is the code itself.
[11:08:25] <pussipupu> I think we can't
[11:08:34] <huf> we cant, but it's the best you're likely to get
[11:08:42] <huf> since the documentation usually lies

[15:56:12] <twb> Dusan_Krehel: "barrier to entry" is probably referring to the steps needed to enter a market or community.
[15:56:37] <twb> Dusan_Krehel: for example, the barrier to entry to operating a lemonade stand is access to lemons, water, sugar, and some form of containment vessel.

[20:37:25] <skidz``> cool, finally somebody created #lesbian
[20:39:05] <pussipupu> The possessive? Plato's
[20:43:20] <twb> skidz``: sadly, the island changed its name.
[20:46:03] <twb> Also it seems like lesvos.ελ is down.
[20:47:06] <CuriosTiger> [itchyjunk]: "Plato's" can both be a possessive AND a contraction of "Plato is". The difference must be deduced from context.
[20:47:46] <CuriosTiger> Plato's tired, but Plato's wife wants him to finish his book.
[20:48:11] <twb> CuriosTiger: I guess his eyes were bigger than his stomach
[20:48:24] <CuriosTiger> twb: Plato's eyes?
[20:48:30] <[itchyjunk]> Plato's work can be though of as [..] then?
[20:48:34] <[itchyjunk]> okay, sounds good.
[20:48:46] <CuriosTiger> Plato's work is a possessive.
[20:48:53] <twb> The joke being that he is eating, not reading, the book
[20:48:54] <CuriosTiger> "Plato is work" doesn't really make sense.
[20:49:10] <CuriosTiger> twb: Yeah, I got that. I was just continuing to demonstrate the possessive.
[20:49:23] <twb> oh right; carry on
