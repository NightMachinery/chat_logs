[03:32:17] <White_Flame> would this be equivalent to extracting the body out to its own toplevel rule, and having a cut at its beginning?
[03:32:36] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@200.5.63.76)
[03:32:50] <White_Flame> hmm, or at the end I guess
[03:50:01] <aindilis> I was thinking something like that
[03:50:22] <aindilis> I was wondering if I could define [! and !] operators
[03:50:33] <aindilis> as well as ifThen and ifThenElse
[03:50:34] <aindilis> etc
[03:54:52] <[relay]_> <dmiles> you can do this with nb_setarg some value that prevents the goal from being recalled.. i'll find my example
[03:55:36] <aindilis> ty!
[03:56:49] <[relay]_> <dmiles> https://gitlab.logicmoo.org/gitlab/logicmoo/logicmoo_workspace/-/blob/master/packs_sys/logicmoo_utils/prolog/logicmoo_test.pl#L345-361
[03:57:57] <[relay]_> <dmiles> in this case i can let the goal seceed with coincepoints but it prevents that section from being called on backtracking
[03:58:06] <[relay]_> <dmiles> choicepoints*
[03:59:59] <aindilis> ty!
[04:00:57] <[relay]_> <dmiles> teh comment %Answers = nb(0),    is what prevents it .. it need to be uncommented
[04:01:14] <aindilis> (I'm fighting with ruby's gem system right now, trying to get it to install vagrant plugin winrm winrm-fs etc, so that I can load a windows VM and figure out how to run that computational autism axiomatic mental modeling code).

[04:31:11] <[relay]_> <dmiles> it shat in LPS-Prolog (what it is written in) allows Functor level inification
[04:34:06] <[relay]_> <dmiles> her ee sthe src code https://gitlab.logicmoo.org/gitlab/logicmoo/logicmoo_workspace/-/blob/master/packs_sys/logicmoo_agi/prolog/neural_bonzon/compiler_cleaner.pl
[04:35:10] <[relay]_> <dmiles> oops not the orrignal that is it after i started poring
[04:36:41] <aindilis> idk if you are interested in Galtisky's BDI system for axiomatic metnal modeling.  It seems pretty handy, if you're interested in porting it from ArityProlog32 to SWI-Prolog.  I just got the Win VM working I think.
[04:36:48] <aindilis> thanks to help from #ruby
[04:38:39] <[relay]_> <dmiles> i download it but i only say one prolog file
[04:38:45] <[relay]_> <dmiles> saw
[04:38:50] <aindilis> *.ari
[04:38:55] <aindilis> tons of them
[04:38:59] <[relay]_> <dmiles> the .ari
[04:39:01] <aindilis> yeah
[04:39:05] <[relay]_> <dmiles> ok good
[04:39:07] <aindilis> :)
[04:39:22] <aindilis> look in the au/Demo/au dir and some of the zips (For evenmore)
[04:39:35] <aindilis> it's a few subdirs down, but find should yield it
[04:41:05] <aindilis> I'm going to ask him tomorrow prob if I can share the text with you (and some other people who are professionally interested in Autism)
[04:41:11] <aindilis> *book
[04:41:43] <aindilis> I've noticed that a lot of people have quirks
[04:41:53] <aindilis> like my mother could not do conditional reasoning.
[04:42:15] <aindilis> so axiomatically representing mental state and rules of inference can help to predict how people would react
[04:42:21] <aindilis> it also contains models of emotinos
[04:42:48] <aindilis> a takeaway from the book - it requires 4th-order mental modeling (i know that you know...) in order to do team formation
[04:42:52] <aindilis> aspies top out at 3rd order
[04:44:12] <aindilis> I want to model who knows what
[04:45:40] <aindilis> Appendix/training_images/au/Demo/au

[04:48:39] <aindilis> btw, it requires registry hacks, so maybe run in a VM like me
[04:51:56] <aindilis> so I get as far as running GEN_Demo.exe, selecting File -> Sample questions, aand then it dies
[04:54:48] <aindilis> oh I see, samples.txt has some questions, that when typed into the text field, return a lookup.  This must not be primary.
[04:54:59] <[relay]_> <dmiles> the code sure does use litls of snips
[04:55:04] <aindilis> :)

[04:58:11] <aindilis> in Appendix/training_images/au there seems to be lots of parts/chapters of the book  in pdf, doc, ppt, etc
[04:58:14] <[relay]_> <dmiles> wrong window
[04:59:13] <aindilis> whoa I just realized that bulk downloading extras.springer.com would probably be a good idea at some point
[04:59:40] <aindilis> if it's allowed I mean
[05:00:12] <[relay]_> <dmiles> ans save to wayback machine
[05:00:53] <[relay]_> <dmiles> i mean and add that dirrectory to it.. so that it will pick up new ones
[05:01:06] <aindilis> yeah good idea
[05:01:49] <aindilis> I wish that that Prolog Jason meta-intepreter page had been backed up too, hopefully the author will reply.  Thinking of using Jason in Prolog for WOPR
[05:02:54] <aindilis> I think comp autism uses Golog
[05:16:51] <aindilis> Oh right, neural_bonzon/compiler_cleaner.pl is from that super interesting paper
[05:23:43] <[relay]_> <dmiles> well it shows a couple tricks to hybriding NN and prolog really well
[05:23:46] <[relay]_> <dmiles> the terms that pass thru the stream are prolog term
[05:23:50] <[relay]_> <dmiles> so much more advanced than could have been down using just NNS
[05:24:30] <aindilis> I wonder what NN you added to LM
[05:24:35] <[relay]_> <dmiles> done*
[05:25:49] <[relay]_> <dmiles> oh the stuff i added was the NLp stuff
[05:25:56] <aindilis> AllenNLP?
[05:26:29] <[relay]_> <dmiles> that and spaCy Flair
[05:26:39] <aindilis> nice
[05:26:50] <aindilis> (restarting LM VM that I had to shut off to fix Vagrant to run WinVM)
[05:27:29] <aindilis> yes, good, about adding some powerful NN stuff, I heard AllenNLP is 10% better than GPT-3 for some supposedly important set of problems
