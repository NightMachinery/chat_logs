[02:29:25] <gordonfish> This is why it's great to have a good magnatic driver, and fuck makers who use non-magnetic screws.. wtf
[02:32:19] <gordonfish> I've sometimes also used a magnetic screw bowl where feasible, one of the few things worth getting from harbor freight, or two, set under where I'm unscrewing something, so if it falls, it wont bounce out but get caught by the nagnet.
[02:32:47] <ether> yeah I got that cardboard trick from a youtube video

[02:46:49] <gordonfish> buu: Actually what I liked about working on some dell laptops (like those vostros) is that about 99% of the screws were all exactly the same length (I think only some of the hinge screws were longer), so you literally could just dump them all into a plastic bin and it wouldn't matter.
[02:47:09] <gordonfish> *same length and size

[06:41:33] <vms14> mst I'm thinking in using DB_File databases as loadable dictionaries, but if the words are "native" (a perl sub instead of a list of words) how should design it in a way that the native words are serializable and loadable too
[06:42:12] <vms14> I think on having the string of code but this would mean I have to actually use eval for every native word to be loaded

[07:05:25] <vms14> xd
[07:05:47] <simcop2387> evaling random code from a database is going to end badly. in any language.
[07:06:15] <vms14> simcop2387: it's for a forth-like language. the language has 2 kind of words, native and words that are just lists of other words
[07:06:28] <simcop2387> the sheer number of security vulnerabilities that this will lead to is just uncountable.
[07:06:29] <vms14> there is a word named save-forth
[07:07:00] <vms14> I can save all the "secondary" words (the ones that are list of words) but idk how should I handle the native ones, which are perl subs
[07:07:01] <simcop2387> https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=java # just look at how many remote code executions you get from java doing it
[07:07:04] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ CVE -  Search Results ]
[07:07:27] <simcop2387> what you should do is store a reference of some kind that you look up in a hash later to find the perl code
[07:07:38] <vms14> the only idea is to write a module with those words
[07:07:41] <simcop2387> like assign a name to each function and look it up later
[07:08:03] <vms14> hmm
[07:08:20] <simcop2387> pretty much yea, there's not a better way to do it.  although what you can probably do is dynamically build that hash by walking the symbol table of that module
[07:08:39] <vms14> I was thinking the database could act as a dictionary as it's DB_File so it's a hash
[07:08:56] <vms14> colon words could just be there
[07:09:11] <vms14> and then I have to think how to manage the "native" ones

[11:48:50] <The_Blode_> So if I use =~ m// can I find out how many matches were found?
[11:51:24] <kjetilho> The_Blode_: yes, use /g and a list context
[11:51:48] <kjetilho> or if you want the list, use grep ?
[11:52:03] <The_Blode_> How can I use grep within Perl itself?
[11:52:26] <The_Blode_> Instead of calling in the shell
[11:52:29] <kjetilho> perldoc -f grep
[11:52:30] <perlbot> kjetilho: Your documentation is available at: https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/grep
[11:52:45] <The_Blode_> Thank you
[11:53:15] <Botje> this sounds like a job for the glob operator actually.
[11:53:25] <Botje> my @files = <file_*>;
[11:53:30] <kjetilho> (I misspoke above, I meant of course scalar context to get the count)
[11:53:47] <Botje> or glob('file_*'); if you wanted to be more explicit
[11:53:53] <The_Blode_> Thanks Botje. Would that store the filenames or the actual files themselves?
[11:54:06] <kjetilho> ugh, I definitely prefer to use the glob() function explicitly
[11:54:25] <Botje> filenames
[11:54:30] <The_Blode_> Thank you.
[11:54:38] <kjetilho> just consider The_Blode_'s question :)  not so strange, since <> *reads* files normally

[11:54:45] <The_Blode_> Would they be ordered numerically or?
[11:55:07] <kjetilho> I don't think you can rely on any sorting, but if they are, it will be lexically.
[11:55:10] <Botje> ordered by whatever order the filesystem spits out.
[11:55:20] <kjetilho> (so 10 comes before 2)
[11:55:37] <The_Blode_> Hmm that might be a problem for me
[11:55:45] <The_Blode_> Could I possibly use sort on Linux?
[11:55:53] <Botje> perl has a built-in sort, you know.
[11:56:05] <Botje> my @files = sort glob('file_*');
[11:56:19] <Botje> note that that will sort file_10 before file_2 as kjetilho remarked

[23:27:11] <Nataraj[m]> Hi! Are there any nice way to add path to @INC in runtime? like "use lib ..." but "use lib" works in compile time... Does anybody know?
[23:29:27] <Botje> no, poking @INC is your best bet.
[23:29:37] <Botje> what do you hope to accomplish with that at runtime?
[23:30:41] <mst> Nataraj[m]: remember that 'use' is just syntax sugar for BEGIN + require + import
[23:31:23] <mst> Nataraj[m]: so lib->import($path) is the runtime version of 'use lib' just like for every perl module ... but that's usually the wrong answer so please explain why you think you want to do this in the first place so we can find a good solution?
[23:36:53] <Nataraj[m]> I want to use module from the dir that is specified in config file. I did  push @INC, $path_from_conf; and then require "ModuleINeed.pm" later. And it worked for me...
[23:40:17] <Nataraj[m]> I guess I need no import, as it is all Object Oriented, I will use ModuleINeed->new() and then use methods of the object...
[23:42:23] <Botje> see also Module::Load or Module::Runtime
[23:42:32] <Botje> to let you skip the stupid name conversion dance
[23:44:56] <Nataraj[m]> Botje: yes, I am actually using Module::Load :-)
