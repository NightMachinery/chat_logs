[05:55:07] <dfcnvt> Sorry I asked the question -- just thought whether if Human is programmable -- since religion has its ritual and practice for keeping the 'value' in its place.
[05:55:24] <chlorine> dfcnvt: of course we are.

[06:05:08] <Player001> that sounds rather bourgeois dfcnvt

[07:17:20] <dfcnvt> I can program...just depends

[07:17:56] <chlorine> dfcnvt: what language?

[07:36:05] <ro-bot-o> [url] Trello | trello.com
[07:38:06] <dfcnvt> it's free, you can sign up and play with creating a board and add cards to the column -- usually each column would be named something like, "Backlog", "Coding", "Test, "Completed", "Failed"
[07:38:34] <dfcnvt> (Not accurately but it's as rough of a process when you move the card to each column as you move the feature)
[07:39:20] <dfcnvt> A card would be a feature -- a small task for a developer to handle and getting it completed.

[09:15:55] <amigojapan> as2333: maybe they will need to explain this yes
[09:17:58] <as2333> they who?
[09:18:09] <amigojapan> Yes the WHO
[09:18:19] <as2333> more like the western part of the who?
[09:18:33] <as2333> assuming of course that china is lying...
[09:19:06] <as2333> I mean, china is an evil commie state. But the part of the WHO run by westerns is morally perfect.

[09:19:31] <Player001> I thought this was supposed to be a philosophy channel lmao
[09:19:34] <as2333> amigojapan but then again, that's the official source of 'scientific facts'
[09:20:22] <as2333> amigojapan and the numbers in japan are pretty low too, although not as low as china's.

[09:21:19] <as2333> of course
[09:21:25] <amigojapan> Yes as2333
[09:21:25] <as2333> I'm talking about %
[09:22:11] <amigojapan> I have not seen the number in percentages
[09:22:33] <amigojapan> Player001: you could change the topic to a philosophy one
[09:22:37] <causative> I'm dubious about China's numbers as well, considering how population dense it is you might expect more spread
[09:22:44] <Player001> yes, what is everyone
[09:22:46] <causative> but it's also very authoritarian and can literally lock people in their apartments
[09:22:50] <causative> and did
[09:22:53] <Player001> who is your favorite philosopher?
[09:23:04] <causative> so it's possible their numbers could be somewhere near as good as they were saying

[09:24:54] <Player001> and amigojapan, what do you like in Descartes and Socrates?
[09:24:54] <as2333> causative what about australia for instance?
[09:25:19] <causative> as2333, I'm not saying it's a bad thing that China locked people in their apartments to prevent the spread of covid
[09:25:23] <causative> it probably saved lives
[09:25:38] <causative> but China is, clearly, a much more authoritarian country than Australia
[09:25:41] <as2333> causative so you're saying authoritarianism is good?

[09:27:41] <amigojapan> as2333: what exactly are you saying about Japan?
[09:27:47] <as2333> what I just said
[09:27:52] <as2333> which is what you said
[09:28:04] <causative> as2333, I'm not saying China is authoritarian *because* it quarantined people, I'm saying that because China is authoritarian it had an easier time (politically) quarantining people
[09:28:09] <amigojapan> as2333: people were not locked in their homes
[09:28:21] <causative> authoritarianism is generally a bad thing
[09:28:26] <causative> just not in this particular case
[09:28:45] <as2333> amigojapan right
[09:29:40] <amigojapan> as2333: Japan said lockdown goes against the Constitution

[09:35:20] <causative> none at all? that's surprising
[09:35:58] <causative> no, they had 14 day quarantine for incoming travelers
[09:36:03] <amigojapan> Only for people that come here causative
[09:41:14] <amigojapan> Only for people that come here*
[09:43:08] <amigojapan> And borders are closed to tourism
[09:50:37] <arcturus> the japanese know better than to sneeze on each other
[09:51:58] <as2333> anyway, somebody mentioned the completely authoritarian politician marx as a 'philosopher'. The actual philosopher was bakunin.
[10:02:29] <Player001> lol
[10:03:17] <causative> marx wasn't authoritarian, he was the opposite, he thought workers would rise up against authority on their own, and organize without rulers

[10:07:04] <Player001> I think the idea of "authoritarianism" obscures the truly important dimension of class struggle
[10:07:48] <causative> well, an authoritarian communist state has simply created a new ruling class
[10:07:58] <causative> they have not succeeded in eliminating class distinctions
[10:08:35] <Player001> not really
[10:08:35] <causative> well, I say they haven't "succeeded," but in fact they weren't trying at all - they were just trying to seize power, and class struggle was a nice PR spin to put on their power grab
[10:09:00] <CyberTailor> socialism without democracy is a bruh moment
[10:10:10] <Player001> this really misses important aspects of class struggle, historical materialism, and so forth
[10:10:20] <causative> capitalist/worker, or authoritarian ruler/subject:  it hardly matters, in both cases you have the powerful few controlling the powerless many

[10:12:49] <causative> Chinese factory workers are in a condition close to the condition of abused European factory workers of Marx's time
[10:12:59] <causative> they work slavish hours for little pay
[10:13:18] <as2333> causative marx's absolutist state wasn't authoritarian? That's real news.
[10:13:31] <Player001> causative: because of imperialism
[10:14:02] <causative> as2333, Marx didn't advocate the few controlling the many
[10:14:15] <as2333> causative so you say
[10:14:19] <as2333> other people disagree
[10:14:20] <causative> he thought we could go the other way, with all the workers together, democratically
[10:15:01] <causative> collective management by the consent of all the workers
[10:15:03] <causative> it was a rosy dream
[10:15:04] <as2333> "an authoritarian communist state has simply created a new ruling class"
[10:15:08] <as2333> well yeah
[10:15:21] <causative> Marx didn't advocate for the kind of states that now call themselves communist
[10:15:23] <Player001> you are both being captured by bourgeois ideology
[10:15:25] <as2333> state and ruling class are basically the same thing
[10:15:30] <causative> he advocated for a "natural" revolution of the workers
[10:15:52] <as2333> causative you think bakunin didn't know marx and didn't know what marxism actually was?
[10:16:17] <Player001> bakunin was wrong
[10:16:32] <as2333> was wrong about what?
[10:16:49] <Player001> the nature of the state
[10:16:54] <as2333> ....
[10:17:00] <as2333> of which state
[10:17:07] <Player001> in general
[10:17:11] <as2333> oh really
[10:17:21] <Player001> the state is the product of class antagonism
[10:17:22] <causative> anyway they're both wrong
[10:17:28] <Player001> Marx was right
[10:17:32] <as2333> both who?
[10:17:35] <causative> the workers aren't going to "naturally" take control
[10:18:01] <causative> instead you get people who take control "on behalf of" the workers, and these people then become rulers who do what they want/what they can get away with
[10:18:13] <Player001> causative: the overthrow of capitalism is inevitable
[10:18:21] <as2333> causative right - that's marx's plan
[10:18:30] <causative> no it's not, Player001
[10:18:35] <causative> capitalism is more powerful than ever
[10:18:37] <Player001> "Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me." -Fidel Castro
[10:18:39] <as2333> causative talk bullshit about the 'workers' - keep enslaving them.
[10:18:58] <causative> even China is more and more capitalist
[10:19:02] <causative> specifically, crony capitalist
[10:19:07] <Player001> China is literally moving left
[10:19:14] <as2333> causative and you're right about that too. Fascism is more powerful than ever. Aka crony capitalism.
[10:19:52] <Player001> capitalism is more fragile than ever
[10:19:57] <causative> everywhere, countries are converging into crony capitalism, the model that lets the rich and powerful enjoy mansions without being censured for it, while also putting their hands deep into the workings of government
[10:20:11] <causative> the rich and powerful want that, and they are powerful, so they get it
[10:20:18] <Player001> everywhere the workers are organizing and engaging in class struggle
[10:20:34] <causative> the working people are not powerful, so they don't get what they want.  Often they are brainwashed into supporting what the rich and powerful want.
[10:20:36] <Player001> we''re in an era of intensifying class struggle
[10:20:43] <Player001> *we're
[10:21:11] <causative> the current era is an era of intensifying *automation*, a trend which makes workers increasingly useless to businesses, and hence increasingly powerless and marginalized
[10:21:20] <as2333> Player001 where are you from?
[10:21:21] <causative> robots are cheaper -> workers are not needed
[10:21:30] <as2333> pretty much
[10:21:51] <Player001> causative: that will lead to more class struggle
[10:21:57] <as2333> the 'workers' are going to be rather useless in this brave new world
[10:21:57] <Player001> as2333: USA
[10:22:10] <as2333> Player001 ok
[10:22:10] <Player001> as2333: not really
[10:22:14] <causative> Player001, soon the rich and powerful will have automatic robot guns, and then any "struggle" would be a joke
[10:22:32] <causative> it wouldn't be a struggle, it would be a massacre
[10:22:58] <as2333> causative have you been reading kaczynski? =P
[10:23:10] <Player001> everything seems impossible until it happens, and then it seems to have been inevitable
[10:23:33] <causative> sure Player001 but you're applying it in the wrong directoin
[10:23:37] <Player001> as2333: where are you from?

[10:23:45] <as2333> argentina
[10:23:53] <Player001> as2333: oh cool
[10:23:55] <causative> you think it's impossible that the ruling class would acquire robot-controlled munitions of sufficient quality to make human soldiers irrelevant
[10:24:02] <as2333> Player001 meh
[10:24:04] <causative> it seems impossible, until it happens
[10:24:18] <Player001> causative: I don't think it's impossible
[10:25:34] <causative> if the trend of automation continues, the workers will eventually have no way to fight back even if they all united
[10:25:51] <causative> and the trend of automation will continue
[10:25:55] <Player001> causative: you think it's impossible the workers can win?
[10:26:05] <causative> it was in the past possible for the workers to win
[10:26:07] <Player001> I think we will win in the end
[10:26:09] <causative> maybe even in the present
[10:26:22] <causative> but in the future, the workers will simply be obsolete, both in work and in war
[10:26:30] <causative> machines will be better and cheaper
[10:26:40] <Player001> that is centuries away
[10:26:50] <causative> no it's not
[10:26:51] <Player001> right now workers make the world run
[10:27:32] <causative> inch by inch, robots take over human jobs. It's happening now and technology never steps back, only forward
[10:27:59] <causative> while humans stay just humans
[10:28:03] <Player001> yes but workers will be needed for the foreseeable future
[10:28:18] <causative> for the next few decades
[10:28:31] <Player001> that's all the time we need :)
[10:28:34] <causative> I wouldn't extend the trend to 2100
[10:29:03] <Player001> 80 years from now?
[10:29:26] <DPA> There are not enough resources (space, food, etc.) on this planet for everyone. This makes it is impossible for everyone to live a nice life, even if there was some perfect system / way to give everyone anything possible.
[10:29:32] <Player001> if capitalism continues the world will be destroyed by then lmao
[10:29:45] <Player001> DPA: not true
[10:29:48] <causative> the rich and powerful won't destroy the world
[10:29:52] <Player001> that is neo-Malthusianism
[10:29:57] <causative> they may destroy the lives of billions, but not the world, because they live on it
[10:30:16] <causative> global warming doesn't bother them - it may kill billions but they'll have mansions and jetskis in Canada
[10:30:53] <DPA> The number of people keeps increasing at an alarming rate, but the earth remains the same size. It needs no genious to see what that means.
[10:31:12] <Player001> DPA: there's enough food being produced to feed everyone
[10:31:29] <Player001> plus, human population will level off pretty soon anyway
[10:31:35] <Player001> and we can feed them just fine
[10:31:53] <DPA> If there is, it won't stay that way for very long. They will not level off.
[10:31:53] <megane> causative: robot surgeons are 100s years away.. no wait.. robot nurses are. handling squishy humans is a difficult problem.
[10:31:56] <Player001> as for space, that really isn't a problem either
[10:32:24] <causative> megane, decades away probably, not 100s
[10:32:49] <causative> the main barrier to robot surgeons will be regulatory, the engineering problems are not that hard
[10:33:18] <causative> they are essentially the problems of computer vision - identifying what part of the patient's body is what
[10:33:19] <Player001> is this the most active channel on the network?
[10:33:33] <causative> and we're doing a pretty good job on computer vision
[10:33:47] <causative> think about a special purpose robot that just does one type of surgery
[10:33:58] <DPA> "This year, we only lost 10 people to a windows update"
[10:34:02] <megane> causative: eye surgery is done by automation afaiui
[10:34:05] <Player001> causative: you kinda give me Grimes vibes
[10:35:05] <megane> causative: but the nursing part needs GAI imo which is 100s of years away, if it's possible at all
[10:35:46] <causative> AGI is decades away
[10:35:49] <causative> maybe closer
[10:36:14] <megane> what's the technology that leads to AGI?
[10:36:24] <causative> deep learning
[10:36:36] <causative> DeepMind's mission is explicitly to make AGI
[10:36:38] <Player001> hey speaking of AGI anyone read Intelligence and Spirit?
[10:37:13] <megane> causative: ok. that's where we disagree.
[10:37:24] <as2333> we live in a technofascist dystopia
[10:37:31] <as2333> exactly like bakunin predicted
[10:37:46] <causative> it is a fact that DeepMind says its mission is to make AGI, and they have *huge* funding and astounding results
[10:37:48] <as2333> a political system ruled by pseudo-scientific bullshit
[10:38:06] <as2333> like the flu farce, 'global warming' and 'artificial intelligence'
[10:38:29] <megane> causative: there was huge funding and results before the last winter too
[10:38:36] <causative> not like this
[10:38:54] <as2333> causative what astounding results are you talking about?
[10:38:57] <causative> there won't be another winter
[10:39:23] <as2333> spamming more advertising for the fucktards and their fucktardphones?
[10:39:31] <causative> AlphaStar, GPT3, relational networks, self-driving cars
[10:40:05] <megane> causative: even self driving cars is 100s of years away with deep learning. you can only train for the situations you have the data for. there's just not enough data for the 0.1% case. (unless we decide we don't need it and accept randomly self-crashing cars)
[10:40:21] <as2333> assuming self-driving cars kinda worked, how are they 'intelligent' exactly?
[10:40:39] <causative> lol what, you can't say self-driving cars are 100s of years away! they just got permission to operate taxi fares in LA
[10:40:45] <DPA> An important thing humans do when something goes wrong is finding a solution. A human can fix a problem he has never encountered before based on priore knowlege and reasoning. Computers aren't very good at that yet, they don't think like that.
[10:41:18] <megane> causative: sure self drivinig cars have been a thing for 10s of years
[10:41:30] <causative> not like this
[10:41:56] <causative> they've never been taking taxi fares from the general public on public roads before
[10:42:09] <as2333> so yeah the technofascist dystopia is in full swing, but thanks to fucktardphones not 'AI'.
[10:42:18] <megane> causative: they are just glorified trams
[10:42:28] <DPA> Todays AIs aren't true general AIs. They aren't designed to be. They are systems, designed to complete a special task, meaning they will fail when new situations not fitting it araise.
[10:42:34] <causative> we have self-driving buses as well in some places
[10:43:01] <causative> deep learning is too economically important to ever have another winter
[10:45:52] <megane> causative: i don't disagree with the usefulness of deep learning. i just have a strong belief it will not get us to AGI
[10:46:42] <causative> it's just waiting for the right insight
[10:46:57] <causative> the right architecture, the right learning rule
[10:47:20] <Player001> I think it will require philosophy
[10:47:38] <causative> there are a lot of very clever people working on this
[10:47:51] <causative> one thing that is guaranteed is that they will do something soon you have not thought of
[10:47:59] <Player001> thinking subjectivity and how a machine could emulate that
[10:48:02] <causative> maybe it won't be AGI, but it won't be what you expected either
[10:48:19] <causative> and maybe the next one will be the key to AGI
[10:48:24] <causative> or the one after that
[10:48:29] <DPA> I'm of the opinion, that because we won't design systems that can do things they weren't meant to, that can truely think for itself, we will never design a true general AI, and that a true general AI is the only thing capable of handling all situations that can araise in complex tasks currently done by humans.
[10:48:44] <causative> you don't know what they're going to figure out tomorrow
[10:49:14] <as2333> causative what do you think 'agi' is?
[10:50:10] <as2333> a bunch of piece of shit engineers are going to create some kind of 'superhuman' thing?
[10:50:56] *** Quits: ruzu (~ruzu@107-179-252-71.cpe.teksavvy.com) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[10:50:59] <causative> AGI is general reasoning ability: the ability to try things, build models of which things work and which things don't, and use the models to seek goals
[10:51:20] <as2333> trial and error?
[10:51:25] <as2333> that doesn't sound too intelligent
[10:51:37] <DPA> "ai safety" is basically a field to make sure robots will never end up human like.
[10:51:43] <causative> trial and error, and the building of models, and the goal-oriented use of models
[10:52:05] <as2333> trial and error is a pretty stupid process
[10:52:12] <as2333> it means you don't know what you're doing
[10:52:23] <as2333> so you just try stuff until something 'works'
[10:52:52] <causative> when you *do* know what you're doing, there's no need for AGI; you've figured it out already, just write down the exact solution
[10:53:02] <causative> AGI is for when we don't know
[10:53:41] <causative> because we want AGI to figure it out
[10:53:49] <causative> (by trying things and seeing what works)
[10:54:02] <as2333> so a bunch of engineers can't solve X but can make a machine to solve X?
[10:54:09] <causative> indeed
[10:54:15] <causative> deep neural networks do this already
[10:54:24] <causative> although, not comprehensively enough to be called AGI
[10:55:21] <causative> by the way, trial and error + the building of models is called "science," and the goal oriented use of models is called "engineering"
[10:55:23] <DPA> deep neural networks just take lots of examples to approximate an algorithmic solution. Those can't reason at all.
[10:55:47] <causative> so the problem of AGI is to build an artificial scientist and engineer
[10:56:01] <as2333> also, I think the 'deep' part is mostly marketing
[10:56:21] <causative> the "deep" part has a clear and specific meaning: it means it has more than a couple of layers
[10:56:48] <causative> it's by contrast to previous neural networks which were very shallow with maybe 1 hidden layer, or no hidden layers
[10:57:14] <as2333> you can put as many 'layers' as you want in those I think.
[10:57:24] <as2333> it's just a bunch of algebra.
[10:57:38] <as2333> mostly used for pattern recognition
[10:57:38] <DPA> If someone does manage to build a true general inteligence it will be interesting. Imagine being able to copy & paste state hackers, for example.
[10:57:40] <causative> it gets more difficult to train the network if you make it too deep
[10:58:07] <causative> that's why earlier networks were so shallow - researchers back then didn't know how to train deeper ones
[10:59:56] <as2333> LMAO

[10:59:58] <ro-bot-o> [url] machine learning - Minimum number of layers in a deep neural network - Cross Validated | stats.stackexchange.com
[11:00:05] <as2333> "Deep" is a marketing term: you can therefore use it whenever you need to market your multi-layered neural network.
[11:00:19] <as2333> I was spot on. Shocking.

[11:02:08] <as2333> yeah they are glorified lookup tables

[11:04:43] <as2333> but you're right about the political aspect of it causative. All this garbage will only be used to furhter enslave people and ultimately exterminate them.

[11:06:29] <amigojapan> I am not kidding
[11:06:32] <as2333> amigojapan you can try that on yourself.
[11:06:46] <amigojapan> No. It needs to be everyone
[11:06:55] <as2333> you can do it yourself pretty easily.
[11:07:06] <amigojapan> Myself will eventually die anyway
[11:07:16] <as2333> and the suffering will end.

[11:07:28] <amigojapan> Not human suffering
[11:07:36] <as2333> but leave me alone
[11:07:47] <DPA> There are multiple ways of stopping human suffering. Not all of them are desirable.
[11:07:47] <amigojapan> as2333: I am taking about all human suffering
[11:08:32] <as2333> amigojapan I think my point is clear
[11:08:48] <amigojapan> as2333: how can I rest in my grave if I know human suffering goes on?

[11:09:35] <as2333> right to free speech?
[11:09:48] <as2333> that may be fine.
[11:10:01] <megane> amigojapan: are you happy about all developments that take us closer to nuclear war?
[11:10:48] <megane> that would probably end all human suffering
[11:10:51] <amigojapan> megane: well it is a bit worrying that they may not take out all of human life
[11:11:06] <amigojapan> megane: it needs to be planned right
[11:11:24] <as2333> amigojapan you should start experimenting on yourself
[11:11:25] <DPA> I think first, we'd need some way to either drastically reduce the amount of people on the planet, or find ways to massively increase the spaces we can live on. If there was maybe 1-10% of the current populations,
[11:11:25] <DPA> I'm sure there would be enough leftover space for machines to fully automate necessary things like food production and such.
[11:11:37] <amigojapan> Shut up as2333
[11:11:44] <as2333> amigojapan lawl
[11:12:01] <as2333> amigojapan so you want freespeech for you to massacre humanity
[11:12:02] <amigojapan> as2333: pretty sure it is against channel rules to tell someone to kill themselves

[11:17:50] <amigojapan> I think it is unethical to let most humans suffer
[11:18:35] <DPA> Nobody wants to die. Many humans even preffer some suffering over dieing.
[11:19:07] <amigojapan> Nobody is too encompassing
[11:19:36] <DPA> If suffering is the concern, we could just engineer people to be incapable of experiencing pain and suffering.
[11:19:55] <amigojapan> That's ok with me
[11:20:43] <DPA> There may be some purpose to having pain, though. It makes us want to avoid it.
[11:21:00] <as2333> It's OK.

[12:03:27] <pussipupu> well you can wake up for half an hour to deal with that and then curl back up
[12:03:46] <arryana> that sounds reasonable to me
[12:03:49] <luminousnine> My system doesn't work quite like that, even though i would want to
[12:04:00] <arryana> course, I can't comment, i'm still jetlagged
[12:04:18] <pussipupu> Yeah mine neither to be honest, always takes me at least some days to recover from a bad night
[12:04:45] <pussipupu> Part of why the small gods are normally locked in the living room at night

[12:05:16] <arryana> admittedly, often we defect to various beds in the house overnight depending who is snoring or bed-hogging
[12:05:17] <DPA> I probably have suffered quiet a bit, but forgotten about it. I once broke my arm. I needed the dentist to fix things. I know some of it was painful. But I can not remember the pain such as to feel it again, mostly I can't remember it at all. But I still think to live is a good thing.
[12:05:41] <arryana> haha, a broken arm is not exactly the pinnacle of suffering

[12:06:29] <arryana> wow
[12:06:36] <arryana> i have a lot of missing pieces, and a few extras
[12:06:48] <arryana> I've got some wired ribs, and a seven inch plate and ten screws in my left ankle
[12:06:59] <arryana> i had a plate in my right when i was younger, but they took it out a few years after it went in
[12:07:11] <pussipupu> I think I broke a toe
[12:07:14] <arryana> haha
[12:07:19] <luminousnine> Aww
[12:07:27] <arryana> no limp, though, i worked hard on that
[12:07:28] <pussipupu> but short of borrowing an x ray machine from work I can't be sure
[12:07:47] <luminousnine> I mangled my toe in the bike's wheel thingies when i was 5, but it wasn't broken
[12:07:56] <arryana> i can say, though, that none of the broken bones were in the top five painful experiences of my life
[12:08:08] <mannequin> k i think it's time for some lecture
[12:08:10] <arryana> and that includes when i broke my shoulder, collarbone, scapula, and four ribs at the same time
[12:08:26] <pussipupu> the radial bits that connect the hub to the rim? that's the spokes of the wheel
[12:08:37] <pussipupu> just in case you needed to know the word :p

[12:09:09] <arryana> having to stitch my own hand was slightly more painful than the broken collarbone
[12:09:40] <arryana> but pain and suffering are not always the same thing

[19:48:42] <Ungwelian> The astounding idea that what we experience is actually mostly true!
[19:48:57] <ldlework> if some belief depended on the temporal ordering of two events, then two people with powerful telescopes might disagree on some things assuming they are computationally bounded

[19:50:02] <causative> they would agree on what each other saw
[19:50:24] <causative> and they would agree on what would be seen from other viewpoints
[19:50:28] <ldlework> that's not how relativity works, they would need too much information that they'd need to compute over (aka, all the details of spacetime between them) in order to resolve the contradiction
[19:50:39] <ldlework> oh sorry, these two people are also very far apart from each other
[19:51:02] <causative> well, of course if they are not allowed enough time and information, they cannot reach the same conclusions
[19:51:16] <ldlework> Sure but some things are just epistemologically unavailable
[19:51:17] <causative> but we were operating under the assumption that they *are* allowed enough time and information
[19:51:53] <ldlework> As long as they don't have infinite time, it's not enough time.
[19:52:40] <causative> this is rather far removed from everyday experience - if you want agents to come to the same conclusion about cosmic phenomena like that, you basically need to put them outside the universe, with as much time as they need to study it
[19:52:54] <ldlework> In everyday experience the situation is even harder
[19:53:00] <causative> the pragmatic truth in that case is a counterfactual
[19:53:01] <ldlework> Because our epistemological boundaries are even smaller
[19:53:10] <causative> it's always a counterfactual, just not as obviously
[19:53:22] <causative> the pragmatic truth is *not* the conclusions two people *actually* come to
[19:53:39] <causative> it's the conclusion they *would* come to, *if*, counterfactually, they had all the information and time and arguments they needed
[19:53:51] <causative> could be a million years of thinking

[19:54:33] <ldlework> Taking it closer to home, it becomes even harder for agents to converge
[19:54:58] <causative> no, if you give them all the time they want and situate them outside the universe so they may study any point in time at their leisure, they would come to the same conclusions
[19:55:16] <causative> I didn't say it is "too" far removed from everyday life
[19:55:21] <ldlework> you're just making the case that the universe itself has a principle of sufficient reason
[19:55:24] <ldlework> most people agree with that
[19:55:28] <ldlework> but epistemology is what fucks it up
[19:55:39] <causative> I said it is removed - as a way of explaining why it is necessary to put them outside the universe
[19:55:46] <ldlework> it isnt useful to say "two people outside the universe with all the facts and same models would arrive at the same conclusion"
[19:55:57] <causative> I didn't say "same models"
[19:55:57] <ldlework> it comes of as tautological
[19:56:07] <ldlework> i'm giving you even more

[19:56:58] <causative> this is not a tautology
[19:57:05] <ldlework> yes, that is me expressing that I understand the conclusions of your thesis
[19:57:15] <ldlework> its a tautology because the presumption is they are rational agents
[19:57:18] <ldlework> you said so before
[19:57:27] <ldlework> so of course they will converge given the same information
[19:57:27] <causative> you didn't state the premise correctly
[19:57:32] <causative> "same models" is not in the premise
[19:57:35] <causative> it's in the conclusion
[19:57:39] <ldlework> it's an inevitable outcome
[19:57:56] <causative> also I am not saying they are "rational" agents
[19:58:02] <causative> they are idealized agents of a sort
[19:58:14] <ldlework> assuming everyone has the mental capacity to understand everything
[19:58:23] <ldlework> aka, rational agents
[19:58:35] <causative> the word "rational" is vague while giving the impression of being specific
[19:58:44] <ldlework> i never get anything out of engaging you
[19:58:47] <causative> there are many kinds of agents that could be called "rational" that might reach different conclusions from the same data
[19:58:48] <ldlework> oh well
[19:59:04] <ldlework> causative: given enough time they will converge on all details and models
[19:59:11] <causative> that is not necessarily true
[19:59:22] <ldlework> all rational agents will converge, because it is the rationality that is the lever that allows for convergence in the first place
[19:59:25] <ldlework> necessarily
[19:59:57] <causative> well, we can certainly *formally specify* agents that would reach different conclusions from the same data
[20:00:03] <causative> the only question is which of these you wish to call "rational"
[20:00:03] <ldlework> you can give them additional properties like mood or whatever, but if the only property they have is that they are able to follow syllogisms then they will eventually understand all domain facts and have the same models
[20:00:16] <causative> and you do not have a formal notion of "rational" so you cannot formally specify which of these disagreeing agents are rational
[20:01:16] <causative> for example, suppose agent A is "rational," and agent B has the same mind as agent A, except agent B accepts the proposition "Flargh is wibble," which has no connection to any other facts
[20:01:23] <ldlework> the formal definition of rational would be to exclusively accept valid/sound arguments
[20:01:37] <causative> no matter how much evidence you present agent A and B, agent A is never going to be convinced that "flargh is wibble," while agent B will never be convinced out of it
[20:01:47] <ldlework> that's just vagueness like any fact

[20:02:41] <ldlework> as long as they only exclusively accept valid and sound syllogisms, they will eventually converge at "pragmatic truth"
[20:02:59] <causative> syllogistic reasoning is a very small portion of what a mind does
[20:03:11] <causative> we very rarely make pure deductions
[20:03:22] <causative> and usually we can only make them in imaginary domains
[20:03:24] <causative> like math
[20:03:26] <ldlework> it seems you don't even believe your own thesis as soon as its conclusion identified as foregone from the premises
[20:03:28] <ldlework> which is hilarious
[20:03:39] <ldlework> because a conclusion becoming foregone from the premises is exactly what reason entails
[20:03:52] <ldlework> more hilarious because I cannot even help but to use language like "entails" to describe the notion
[20:04:07] <causative> no, what I'm saying is, for agents *like us*, there is probably a single pragmatic truth that two agents would agree on after sufficient consideration of facts and arguments
[20:04:17] <causative> but there could be agents *unlike us* for which this is not the case

[20:04:32] <ldlework> we do have a formal definition of what it means to be rational
[20:04:37] <ldlework> it's defined in terms of the logic
[20:04:40] <ldlework> what we don't have
[20:04:46] <ldlework> is what is meant by "agents unlike us"
[20:04:51] <ldlework> along a metric that is relevant to this matter
[20:04:54] <causative> you have a formal definition of what it means to be rational?
[20:04:58] <causative> I would love to see it
[20:04:59] <ldlework> aka, not height, pigmentation, etc
[20:05:22] <ldlework> causative: to be rational relative to some formal system, is to apply the rules of the system without err
[20:05:31] <ldlework> not very mysterious
[20:05:41] <causative> I wouldn't call that rational, what if the formal system is garbage?
[20:06:06] <ldlework> > based on or in accordance with reason or logic.
[20:06:06] <causative> then you'd reach garbage conclusions
[20:06:22] <ldlework> you want rational to mean something beyond what it does
[20:06:32] <ldlework> some romanticism
[20:06:38] <causative> oh yes, the single canonical "reason or logic" we've all heard about, can you tell me which axioms to use?
[20:06:40] <ldlework> it just means you applied some rules without err
[20:06:49] <causative> is the axiom of choice canonically reasonable, or not?
[20:06:51] <ldlework> everything that just came out of my mouth
[20:06:57] <ldlework> implies there are multiple logics and formal systems
[20:07:01] <ldlework> you're reacting now
[20:07:31] <causative> there are multiple logics and formal systems and some of them give garbage results
[20:07:36] <ldlework> It even converges with your contention about "different agents"
[20:07:52] <causative> a complete idiot could be called "rational" under your definition if we could work out a formal system describing his behavior
[20:08:15] <ldlework> this is the only useful sense in which there would be "diffrent kind of agents"
[20:08:20] <ldlework> we don't care about their height differences
[20:08:26] <ldlework> nor their metabolic systems
[20:08:48] <ldlework> if we're talking about the qualitative differences between agents with regards to their ability to take all universal facts at converge towards shared propositions
[20:08:52] <ldlework> then it by way of some system of logic
[20:09:15] <ldlework> the "differences" is going to be in what systems of logic, by which these perfect reasoners are divergent
[20:10:34] <causative> okay, so we may be in agreement, that there can be different agents that apply their reasoning "perfectly" but that work according to different systems of reasoning and reach different conclusions from the same data
[20:11:01] <ldlework> Assuming they're perfect reasoners in their own system of logic but for some reason can't contemplate other systems of logic.
[20:11:11] <ldlework> And which system of logic they employ is built into their physical biology
[20:11:24] <ldlework> And therefore cannot ever broach the subject of which system of logic they should employ in discourse
[20:11:57] <causative> we could imagine that they can talk about other systems of logic and reject them
[20:12:07] <ldlework> we could imagine anything
[20:12:13] <causative> because the other systems of logic are inferior by the criteria of the logic they already have
[20:12:57] <causative> because the other systems of logic reach conclusions that the logic they already have says must be false
[20:13:02] <ldlework> That's again assuming they cannot escape some biologically rooted system of logic
[20:13:25] <ldlework> And don't have some form of generalized "turing completeness" able to engage any system of logic and consider its outputs, etc.
[20:13:44] <ldlework> Most systems of logic are representable in other systems of logic
[20:13:51] <causative> no, it's not assuming they are unable to engage other systems of logic
[20:13:58] <ldlework> So assuming they couldn't "run the OS" of another logic ontop of their logic
[20:14:01] <causative> it's the opposite of that
[20:14:10] <causative> they *can* run the OS of another logic on top of theirs
[20:14:14] <causative> and they judge it is all wrong
[20:14:37] <ldlework> Only if they use their fundamental logic to judge the secondary logic.
[20:14:42] <causative> which obviously they would
[20:14:48] <ldlework> But if they're capable of directly using other logics to make such considerations
[20:14:59] <ldlework> Then it's completely parametric on which logic they purposefully employ
[20:15:22] <causative> agent A would be capable of understanding "agent B would think X" without agent A needing to think X himself
[20:15:51] <ldlework> Right but agent A can also see why agent B would think X from B's perspective, unadultered by their own natural logic
[20:15:59] <causative> yes
[20:16:00] <ldlework> if they are indeed able to engage with logics on their own terms, consciously
[20:16:09] <causative> but that is still different from agent A thinking X himself
[20:16:17] <causative> it's not a matter of "purposefully employing" anything, agent A just operates by different rules from agent B - the rules by which the agents operate *are* the agents
[20:16:17] <ldlework> agent A can take on a belief in X
[20:16:22] <ldlework> even if their natural logic would refute it
[20:16:27] <causative> no he can't
[20:16:39] <causative> if his natural logic refutes it, then A doesn't believe it
[20:16:42] <ldlework> as long as he can see why B would believe it, unadultered by A's natural logic
[20:16:52] <ldlework> see you're refusing to let A make considerations beyond his natural logic
[20:17:02] <ldlework> you presume an "unconscious bias" or process where in
[20:17:05] <causative> A can see why B would believe X, and judge B's reasons for believing X to be stupid, and reject them
[20:17:24] <causative> conversely, B can see why A would believe not-X, and judge A's reasons for believing not-X to be stupid, and reject them
[20:17:29] <ldlework> but A can also see B's reasons for using system of B for taking on X
[20:17:37] <ldlework> the same way A can see why B took on X using reason B
[20:17:53] <causative> B doesn't have a "reason" for using the system of B
[20:17:53] <ldlework> you're assuming that the only logic that A can actually utilize at the end of the day is logic A
[20:18:00] <causative> the system of B is B
[20:18:06] <ldlework> causative: that's to say that A doesn't have any reason for rejecting B's system of logic
[20:18:07] <causative> it's not a choice B makes
[20:18:12] <ldlework> of course it is
[20:18:18] <ldlework> otherwise you can't engage any alternative system of logic
[20:18:26] <ldlework> and A can't really understand why B takes X
[20:18:42] <causative> B can *simulate* other systems of logic just fine
[20:18:59] <ldlework> You just said that B has no reason for taking his primary system of logic
[20:19:10] <ldlework> But if there are no reasons which drive which primary system of logic is employed
[20:19:19] <ldlework> Then there is also no reason why A has to reject B's system of logic over their own
[20:19:30] <ldlework> Since A also has no reason for prioritizing their own system of logic
[20:19:34] <ldlework> Also, this is meta-logic
[20:19:37] <causative> yes there is, the reason is that A already has his own system, which says B's system is wrong

[20:20:22] <ldlework> right i identified that you were entraping the agents biologically
[20:20:23] <causative> it's unwarranted, but it's what A was given by virtue of being A
[20:20:31] <causative> all agents are "trapped" in this way
[20:20:32] <ldlework> long ago
[20:20:41] <ldlework> then no agent really ever engages any other logic
[20:20:45] <ldlework> in any meaningful sense
[20:20:50] <causative> I would object to saying "biologically" though
[20:21:14] <causative> these are formal, idealized agents, capable of considering evidence over any amount of time - we should not assume they have any biology
[20:21:18] <ldlework> you are saying their psychology is powerful enough to consider other logics, but not strong enough to directly employ them
[20:21:28] <ldlework> their fundamental logic can't be set aside
[20:21:36] <ldlework> therefore it's not a matter of the software/understanding they have
[20:21:41] <ldlework> but how their brain physicall works
[20:21:44] <causative> these idealized agents are mathematical constructs, not physical entities
[20:21:51] <ldlework> so?
[20:22:07] <causative> so that's why I object to saying they are trapped by their "biology"
[20:22:09] <ldlework> there's an infinite number of mathematical constructs that each have their own mechanisms
[20:22:11] <ldlework> same for brains
[20:22:14] <ldlework> physicality is irrelevant
[20:22:20] <causative> it's not biology, it's math that traps them - the axioms defining how they reason
[20:22:33] <causative> if you want to say "traps"
[20:22:35] <ldlework> if you cannot see the analogy it explains much of the difficulty in discourse
[20:22:54] <ldlework> it's beyond analogy, its correspondence
[20:23:07] <ldlework> computation, proof and physical evolution are all the same thing
[20:23:08] <causative> physicality does matter in the sense that a physical brain cannot work forever and cannot stand outside the universe to observe it
[20:23:13] <ldlework> see curry-howard, wolfram, et al
[20:23:41] <causative> we have to work with an idealized abstract agent, not a physically realized, messy actual agent that can be "persuaded" by such arguments as head trauma or brain surgery
[20:23:50] <causative> or old age
[20:23:54] <ldlework> whatever properties a physical agent might have
[20:24:00] <ldlework> you can encode into some mathematical system

[20:24:39] <causative> a Turing machine can do what they do, but not vice versa
[20:25:02] <ldlework> that's totally inconsequential
[20:25:37] <ldlework> we can presume perfect machines who's mathematical properties correspond to their physical evolution. sure they break down, i wonder why literally no one ever mentions that in literature
[20:25:49] <ldlework> (because they're not on the internet trying hard as possible to avoid dialectic)
[20:26:13] <causative> if we are presuming perfect machines then we are dealing with mathematical abstractions, not physical objects

[20:26:28] <causative> (and also this is what people do when they talk about Turing machines in the literature)
[20:26:45] <ldlework> which is why the proposition "which we talk about is totally arbitrary and inconsequential and your stoping the conversation demonstrates you were confused about this correspondence until just now"
[20:26:54] <ldlework> is true
[20:27:39] <causative> the distinction between the physical object and the idealized formalization of it harkens to Plato's theory of forms
[20:27:49] <causative> it's something you have to acknowledge as significant
[20:28:03] <ldlework> no it's not, and no one else does either
[20:28:14] <causative> of course they do
[20:28:51] <causative> everyone knows that a simulation is not the same as the physical system, or that their desktop computer can't *actually* run a Turing machine
[20:28:53] <ldlework> having read a number of books on both philosophy and computation, no, no they don't
[20:30:14] <ldlework> If you can find a paper that refutes curry-howard, because after all, who's going to oil the turing machine, let me know.
[20:31:22] <causative> wtf does "refuting curry-howard" have to do with the distinction between a physical object and a mathematical abstraction? are you saying that curry-howard relates programs to proofs, it relates physical objects to abstract entities? I have news for you, the programs mentioned in curry-howard are abstract entities too, not physical objects
[20:31:44] <ldlework> programs and proofs is just the original correspondence which has since then been extended to physical systems
[20:31:59] <ldlework> i just assume you have non-zero awareness of the things we're talking about, sorry
[20:32:28] <causative> you have some kind of misunderstanding and you are being aggressive and derogatory about it
[20:32:35] <causative> instead of engaging in dialectic
[20:32:42] <ldlework> lol engaging in dialectic would be
[20:32:56] <ldlework> "it doesn't matter whether we talk about physical systems or mathematical constructs"
[20:32:58] <ldlework> "sure"
[20:33:05] <ldlework> but rather we got
[20:33:08] <ldlework> "machines break down"
[20:33:14] <ldlework> as if that's relevant whatsoever to the point at hand
[20:33:40] <causative> it's relevant in that you should accept it as an obvious fact, and move on to talking about mathematical constructs
[20:33:54] <causative> it's not tremendously relevant to the main subject, but it shouldn't be a sticking point
[20:33:59] <ldlework> it's irrelvant to the qualtiative properties we care about
[20:34:03] <ldlework> no one else makes this point
[20:34:10] <ldlework> it's conventional to do what I did
[20:34:12] <causative> bandwagon fallacy
[20:34:21] <ldlework> it's unconventional to talk about the rust of physical systems
[20:34:22] <causative> and not even valid, because people do acknowledge the distinction
[20:34:26] <ldlework> they don't!
[20:34:34] <ldlework> because it doesn't bear upon the point that's being made
[20:34:42] <ldlework> when people talk about the correspondence between physical systems and proofs/programs
[20:34:59] <ldlework> it's a true but utterly irrelevant fact that doesn't bear upon what's being observed
[20:35:07] <ldlework> it's a non-sequitur
[20:35:09] <ldlework> a red-herring
[20:35:13] <ldlework> it's something you say
[20:35:22] <ldlework> when you feel like you have to refute any thesis provided by the person you're talking to
[20:36:03] <ldlework> like "you're fundamentally entrapping some agent in a system of logic, as if that was the logic employed by the implementation of their biological brain"
[20:36:32] <ldlework> yes, you could do the same in a mathematical construct, or a program, but it isn't a point of contention.
[20:36:52] <causative> it's actually a rather important distinction, because what *is* the appropriate formal system to model how a human would ideally think if they had unlimited time and memory?
[20:37:08] <causative> we don't actually know that, and translating messy biology into something ideal, that still approximates the biology, is far from trivial
[20:37:13] <ldlework> it doesn't matter at all, what we care about is that there is some system of reasoning
[20:37:22] <ldlework> the point was not that their brains are biological
[20:37:36] <ldlework> but that you've presupposed they're trapped to only ever directly engage 1 system of logic
[20:37:51] <causative> if you formally specify how they think, then they are "trapped" by how you specified them
[20:37:56] <causative> they can never do anything other than what you specified for them
[20:38:05] <causative> that's what it means to specify something mathematically
[20:38:11] <ldlework> that's like saying they can only really ever use whatever system of logic is employed by their biology, limiting what kind of reasoning they can really do psychologically
[20:38:17] <ldlework> dude
[20:38:28] <ldlework> it's unreal
[20:38:41] <ldlework> it's like you don't really understand correspondences deep down
[20:39:32] <causative> just engage in dialectic, if you want to. Don't try to insult the other person, try to reason with them, if you value dialectic.
[20:39:56] <arryana> good god, all the hot air in here could power a perpetual motion machine forever.
[20:39:59] <causative> if you think I don't understand something, it's not your job to insult me. It's your job to try to persuade me of (what you think is) my error.
[20:40:00] <ldlework> if you truly don't understand correspondence, dialectic is hopeless until that fact that you don't is identified and remedied
[20:40:17] <ldlework> causative: I've already tried that
[20:40:21] <ldlework> you just reiterate your thesis
[20:40:28] <ldlework> that somehow math and systems are different some how
[20:40:31] <ldlework> when the whole world knows they're not
[20:40:53] <ldlework> we went through the articulation of why they're not
[20:40:58] <arryana> this is like watching two children with their fingers in their ears yelling 'lalalalala I can't hear you!' at each other.
[20:40:58] <ldlework> and at the end you just reiterated your thesis
[20:41:06] <ldlework> so it would seem that you don't truly appreciate the nature of correspondences
[20:41:20] <causative> "the whole world" meaning except Plato, or mathematical fictionalists, or whoever wrote https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine#Comparison_with_real_machines

[20:41:26] <arryana> haha
[20:41:32] <arryana> how's you, then
[20:41:44] <causative> basically any introduction to Turing machines will tell you they are not real, physical machines
[20:41:51] <causative> they are an idealization
[20:41:59] <ldlework> causative: who's idealization has a correspondence!
[20:42:06] <ldlework> an real, mathematical correspondence
[20:42:27] <ldlework> any given system corresponds to some mathematical proof or program
[20:42:29] <ldlework> you never have to say
[20:42:39] <ldlework> "let's just use mathematical constructs, because that's what they are"
[20:42:45] <ldlework> because we could easily as well talk in terms of programs

[20:48:24] <causative> there may be a formal correspondence, but how do we specify it? How, for example, do we *formally* determine when a particular pattern in Conway's game of life is a Turing machine?
[20:48:27] <ldlework> I mean I personally don't know who was the first
[20:48:32] <ldlework> but it's not really hard to google

[20:48:41] <ldlework> https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta/rose3.pdf
[20:49:07] <ldlework> Plenty of stuff coming out of Wolfram Research on this as well
[20:49:54] <causative> does this paper answer my question exactly - "how do we specify the formal correspondence between the physical system and the formal, mathematical idealization?" or is it just tangentially related?
[20:50:53] <causative> I've asked around on physics and philosophy stackexchange for what a "physical system" is, formally and mathematically, and received no useful answers
[20:51:15] <ldlework> It's a formalization of a correspondence between the category theory used in curry-howard, and topology
[20:51:27] <causative> that doesn't sound like an answer to my question, then
[20:51:40] <ldlework> I don't know what possible other answer you could want.
[20:51:51] <ldlework> Physics is topology
[20:52:05] <causative> is Conway's game of life topology?
[20:52:13] <ldlework> yes?
[20:52:27] <causative> in what way?
[20:52:53] <causative> what's the topology, do you mean just the topology of the underlying grid?
[20:52:58] <ldlework> i'm not prepared to explain the way in which geometries arise out of almost every area of mathematics
[20:53:15] <causative> because that is not sufficient to specify the behavior of Conway's game of life
[20:53:37] <ldlework> You wouldn't use terms from topology to specify conway's game of life on its own terms
[20:53:43] <causative> the majority of Conway's game of life is the update rules, which do not seem to be topological, though I wouldn't rule out the possibility of some kind of topological interpretation
[20:53:46] <ldlework> But certainly there is a topological accounting for automata
[20:53:57] <ldlework> This is literally what led to the Wolfram physics project
[20:54:13] <causative> the Wolfram physics project deals with another kind of automata that are obviously topological
[20:54:22] <causative> Conway's game of life is not the same as that kind of automata
[20:54:22] <ldlework> Have you read NKS?
[20:54:25] <causative> yes
[20:54:29] <ldlework> The whole book is a precursor to the physics project
[20:54:33] <ldlework> Then you remember the back of the book
[20:54:47] <ldlework> where he specifically talks about how the ideas of automata led him to thinking about physics
[20:54:47] <causative> the notes?
[20:54:51] <ldlework> no
[20:55:02] <ldlework> chapter 9
[20:55:23] <ldlework> in wolfram's live talks he regularly references the fact that automata are what got him thinking about the structure of spacetime
[20:55:30] <causative> yes, I recall that
[20:55:30] <ldlework> the physics livestreams
[20:55:53] <ldlework> there are even parts in NKS where he directly talks about automata in terms of their topoligical properties
[20:56:33] <ldlework> seriously, "why do nearly all areas of math come loaded with a geometry" is a huge question in meta-mathematics right now
[20:57:12] <causative> I don't think this paper answers my question
[20:59:56] <causative> here's one of my attempts at answering it:  https://pastebin.com/raw/PdqWChqF
[21:00:12] <ldlework> this is just a parting gift, I've tried to encourage you in the past, but in the interm I made a playlist
[21:00:14] <ldlework> https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNw6S-KKWA6FsvJMu5WEFx3JD7NU5K6m
[21:00:43] <causative> it's a deep question.  The question is, what is a system, formally and mathematically?
[21:01:09] <causative> to answer this we need to first say what a physical universe is, formally and mathematically, in a way general enough to include most or all kinds of universes we want to talk about
[21:01:26] <causative> and then we need to say how we formally locate a system within the universe, and track its states and inputs over time
[21:01:47] <arryana> we're adjusting the heat here too, just turned it on this week
[21:02:01] <causative> and then we need to deal with the fact that a *formal* system, like a Turing machine, usually cannot be exactly embedded into the universe
[21:02:10] <arryana> oddities of living In a different house, still adjusting the radiators
[21:02:20] <causative> because of problems like limited energy or machines breaking down or colliding with other machines
[21:02:45] <causative> it's not easy to solve, I've asked around and I don't know of anyone who has solved it
[21:03:05] <causative> I'm trying to solve it - I've taken a stab at several different formalisms for it, each of them limited in some way
[21:03:48] <causative> but it's an important question, how do we *formally* say when a system is present, versus the informal hand-waving that usually goes on now?
[21:04:20] <pussipupu> We have a wonderful fireplace (very high heat storage and efficiency) and old walls, so we end up overheating the living room temporally but that hearts the house for days
