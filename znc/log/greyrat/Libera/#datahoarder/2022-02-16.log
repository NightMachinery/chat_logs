[16:08:09] <merpaderp> NeoThermic: no raid, I will use software raid, like I already do with mobo's sata ports
[16:08:32] <merpaderp> I think the card I was looking for before had 4 sas which can do 8 sata or something? that is more than enough for my needs
[16:08:53] <merpaderp> its really basic card, ~50 bucks and is flashed with something to disable its hardware raid capabilities
[16:08:57] <unfinity> ・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\_o​< quack​!
[16:08:58] <NeoThermic> so you're looking for a simple 8i card, that'll have two SFF ports and you just need a breakout cable
[16:08:59] <NeoThermic> ,bang
[16:08:59] <unfinity> NeoThermic you shot a duck in 2.702 seconds! You have killed 372 ducks in #datahoarder.
[16:09:00] <merpaderp> I just don't remember how it's called
[16:09:22] <NeoThermic> 6G fine or do you require 12G (or better? :P )
[16:09:33] <merpaderp> sata 6G?
[16:09:37] <NeoThermic> ya
[16:09:52] <merpaderp> 6G is fine, didn't knew there is anything else
[16:10:08] <NeoThermic> I mean, if you have the money, they go up to 24G currently :D
[16:10:28] <merpaderp> it will run good old lazy 3.5" HDDs
[16:10:50] <NeoThermic> but yeah, an lsi 9211-8i would suffice
[16:11:05] <NeoThermic> it's non-raid capable, so it should just be HBA-ready
[16:11:19] <NeoThermic> and you just need two SFF-8087 to SATA breakout cables
[16:11:28] <NeoThermic> and that'll get you 8 SATA ports
[16:11:55] <merpaderp> and that is all I basically need
[16:12:12] <NeoThermic> hit up the ebay and they're like 30-50, cause it's technically old stuff but if you just want 6G SATA it'll suffice and work
[16:12:17] <merpaderp> looks like prices are a bit higher for these than I checked before
[16:13:03] <NeoThermic> it also provides an upgrade path because a lot of rack cases use SFF8087 as the backplane connector, so you can eventually upgrade to a rackmounted thing with that backplane and run an SFF to SFF cable
[16:13:22] <merpaderp> I will put it in my "desktop" server
[16:13:32] <merpaderp> or rather "server" in quotes
[16:13:44] *** Joins: MrZeus__ (~MrZeus@185.248.85.53)
[16:13:47] <NeoThermic> yeah, everyone starts out that way
[16:13:56] <merpaderp> not sure why are they making motherboards with such little count of sata ports these days
[16:14:09] <NeoThermic> because most people don't have storage requirements that high
[16:14:24] <NeoThermic> 2xM2 slots and two SATA ports covers 99% of peoples storage needs
[16:14:57] <merpaderp> my mobo has no M2 ports, I have NVMe drive on PCIe expansion card setup
[16:15:16] <NeoThermic> this is also technically why M2 drives stay around 1 or 2TB, because the market doesn't yet demand more and the cost of making them isn't too expensive vs making larger
[16:15:29] <merpaderp> btw what's up with these offers on ebay? the all sound the same, it's side hussle of datacenter people to sell off old equipment this way?
[16:15:47] <NeoThermic> so old cards get pulled from prod often
[16:15:57] <merpaderp> they specifically mention zfs, freenas and unraid
[16:15:59] <NeoThermic> these days a 6G card in a DC is like, super legacy :D
[16:16:08] <merpaderp> that makes sense
[16:16:14] <NeoThermic> yeah, as they want to make sure you get the right card (and hit key words, too)
[16:17:17] <merpaderp> description says these things require agressive cooling 
[16:17:28] <merpaderp> makes sense since they are made for servers
[16:17:34] <NeoThermic> yes! well, ish!
[16:17:42] <NeoThermic> they require high airflow
[16:17:59] <NeoThermic> but a lot of people who slap them in non-server cases just attach a 40mm fan to it and call it done
[16:18:21] <NeoThermic> https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/8u7syj/how_i_cooled_my_lsi_sas92118i_card_with_a_noctua/ stuff like this
[16:19:10] <NeoThermic> I did the same for a number of years too, but now at least I have a server case, so I get the proper cooling
[16:19:10] <merpaderp> this guy did finger test! must be some sort of scientist
[16:20:24] <merpaderp> so these cards are 50 bucks and below if shipped from china, in EU those are 70 eur and beyond, lame.

[16:21:39] <NeoThermic> https://i.imgur.com/3JypWVz.png you sometimes need to do this for things like 10G network adapters that are also designed for server airflow
[16:26:23] <merpaderp> okay, then just figure out what size HDDs to get
[16:26:29] <merpaderp> currently have 5x 2TB 
[16:26:53] <NeoThermic> so.. if the budget is there, forget anything smaller than 8TB
[16:27:07] <NeoThermic> IIRC 14 or 16 is the sweetspot of $/TB
[16:27:56] <merpaderp> that indeed aligns with my research 14,16TB is sweet spot per TB
[16:28:07] <merpaderp> albeit it was weird hitatchi HDDs, but it hardly matters I guess
[16:28:46] <NeoThermic> don't think it does, I still cheap out and shuck WD externals because those are the cheapest per TB
[16:47:46] <merpaderp> these days it's quite easy to get serious amount of storage or so it seems
[16:47:54] <merpaderp> 16TB times 5 
[16:48:03] <merpaderp> minus one for parity, iirc
[16:48:10] <merpaderp> so thats 64TB
[16:49:01] <NeoThermic> IMO at that size, I'd have two parity
[16:49:30] <NeoThermic> ,wa 64TB/6Gb/s
[16:49:30] <merpaderp> because rebuild would take forever and stress the living shit out of them ( down the road, once they are old )

[16:49:53] <NeoThermic> yep, as the above is like, BEST CASE 
[16:50:11] <NeoThermic> also you get a small readspeed bonus ;)
[16:50:33] <merpaderp> that makes sense, so two extra drives on tops.
[16:50:56] <merpaderp> man, I am bad at calculating raid needs, I am good at using raid, however
[16:51:52] <NeoThermic> FWIW I run an 8x8TB array in RAID6, so I have 43.6TB after _everything_ is taken away from the 64TB RAW
[16:52:31] <merpaderp> some random calculator on teh internet says I can have 6 disks in raid6 with 64TB and 2 drive failure tolerance.
[16:52:51] <NeoThermic> 6x16? yes
[16:52:56] <merpaderp> it says 48 about yours, so about right
[16:53:13] <NeoThermic> 4*16 = 64TiB RAW, and a bit less once your FS is there
[16:53:16] <merpaderp> okay, so raid 6 it is, noted.
[16:53:26] <merpaderp> yea, the magic of units advertised vs used
[16:53:42] <NeoThermic> yeah, 48TiB raw, 43.661TB raw, and a little bit less once NTFS came along for it
[16:54:23] <merpaderp> do you defragment your ntfs?
[16:54:42] <NeoThermic> I mean, yes and no. Not active, but windows does it in the background if/when required
[16:55:02] <NeoThermic> but a lot of the items written to the array are large and sequential, so it doesn't often need to move anything on a defrag
[16:56:04] <NeoThermic> if I was doing a lot of CRUD with smaller files and then doing Rs with big files, yeah, there'd be work done on the defrag
[16:58:55] <merpaderp> I have one directory where I keep github sources I find interesting
[16:59:00] <merpaderp> I also call it lazy directory
