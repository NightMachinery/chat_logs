[02:05:13] <wasamasa> I've considered writing a blog post on these few cases where it's needed, but realized I don't really understand it at all
[02:05:52] <bpalmer> it does use macros, incidentally; cl-incf, for example.
[02:06:03] <parsnip> what would you call your linting package?
[02:06:25] <wasamasa> sure, but org-string-nw-p isn't one
[02:06:33] <bpalmer> some sort of eval-and-compile or eval-when-compile is often suggested when using the cl stuff.
[02:06:48] <wasamasa> yes, for a very specific reason
[02:07:10] <wasamasa> so that the import isn't performed at runtime, thereby avoiding pollution of the namespace
[02:07:16] <bpalmer> ha, I completely bypassed cl-defun.
[02:07:24] <bpalmer> ah well.
[02:07:36] <wasamasa> cl-lib doesn't need this anymore
[02:07:51] <wasamasa> so I suspect remaining uses of eval-when-compile are the result of mechanical translation of old code
[02:08:01] <wasamasa> except special cases like cc-mode
[02:08:16] <wasamasa> anyway
[02:08:45] <wasamasa> the one example aside from terrible emacs packages I've found, where you want eval-when-compile is to perform compile-time substitution of some constant value
[02:08:49] <bpalmer> I think you still want it if you want macros to be expanded when you batch-byte-compile it, or?

[02:46:40] <bpalmer> That's been one of the theories: they invaded Crimea when Ukraine was on the verge of opening some of its offshore  fields; they invaded this year as Ukraine was about to open something else

[06:57:53] <rdrg109> bpalmer: Yes, but I want the list to be (?a ?b ?c). I don't want ? to be interpreted as a converter of a to 97.
[06:58:04] <bpalmer> rdrg109: just like 'a' in C *is* 97. a char is just an int. ? is just a way of writing things. (Similarly, #x10 is the same as 16)
[06:58:32] <bpalmer> rdrg109: if you want to control how things look, perhaps you want to create a list of strings.
[06:58:51] <johnjaye> rdrg109: lookup the "lisp reader" and "lisp printer" in the emacs manual. it will fill you in on the specifics
[06:59:15] <johnjaye> but basically lisp when it reads your code has to decide what each syntactical element translats to
[06:59:17] <bpalmer> (mapcar (lambda (i) (format "?%c" i)) '(?a ?b ?c))
[06:59:43] <johnjaye> when you write ?a the lisp reader translates that to an integer 97

[07:03:23] <bpalmer> Or, to be clearer, (symbol-name (car '(\?a))) => "?a"

[07:04:05] <rdrg109> As you can see there, the "?" doesn't convert the character "a" to 97
[07:04:06] <bpalmer> johnjaye: sure, most characters are valid symbol constituents in lisps.
[07:04:12] <johnjaye> well anyway the short version is both sbcl and elisp have a reader and a printer and certain syntax is interpreted in certain ways
[07:04:17] <johnjaye> in this case they disagree
[07:04:53] <bpalmer> the answer is to escape things in elisp, or see if slime-eval can accept a string to evaluate instead.

[14:41:52] <bremner> afidegnum: what are you trying to do?
[14:42:51] <bremner> you can apply lambdas scheme style, just by writing them in the function position: (let ((x 1)) (  (lambda (x) (+ x 3) (print x)) 7) )
[14:42:55] <afidegnum> this is what I got let: Symbol’s function definition is void: \,

[14:43:10] <afidegnum> ok
[14:44:06] <bovid-19> afidegnum: You are creating an anonymous function inside the let binding.  The function is a closure, so its 'x' is not the same as the one in let.  You would have to give it another name to be able to access it.  And you do not provide it with an input.
[14:44:20] <bovid-19> (let ((x 1))
[14:44:20] <bovid-19>  (lambda (y)
[14:44:20] <bovid-19>    (+ y 3) (print y)) x )
[14:44:44] <bremner> all that being true, it's still a strange function
[14:44:47] <bovid-19> works as you want
[14:44:50] <bremner> the (+ x 3) is useless
[14:44:51] <bovid-19> (let ((x 1))

[18:48:26] <jbe> like, yes, maybe a lot of functionality of third party libraries should be in some kind of standard library instead, but it's basically moving towards that anyway as it is (like, jquery is basically obsolete now). you can make a stupid library in any language which has one (or more) package managers

[21:59:51] <technomancy> the more you have to deal with data coming from outside your type system, the harder it is for the type system to help you, I Guess
[22:00:07] <bpalmer> there are those window managers that, to change configuration, insist you recompile the program.
[22:00:21] <bremner> part of it is that Haskell type errors can be pretty inscrutable to me
[22:00:37] <zebrag> bremner: static languages are a hell to setup initially, that for sure: you type 10 time as much of usafe language when you type one line of safe static code

[23:38:37] <Bayes> does it bother anyone else when you name your variable `height` and then you adjust it, you get a new variable called `adjHeight` and not `heightAdj` ?
[23:38:50] <Bayes> `height` and `heightAdj` being lexicographically closer just make more sense
[23:38:52] <Bayes> in my brain
[23:39:22] <Bayes> cause you start typing height and you get all the offspring variables related to the `height` variables
