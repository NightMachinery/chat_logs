[02:30:04] <Evolver> panella32: I guess it depends on the base model, if any, and what the nature of the captcha is.
[02:30:12] <Evolver> and what kind of accuracy you need
[02:32:54] <Evolver> panella32: can consider some of the links here: https://paste.ee/p/QuVDB
[02:33:11] <panella32> I appreciate your helpful replay @Evolver. Some example of the captcha can be found here. Also the problem is that I have not too much time to make a big dataset with proper name. That's the only problem.
[02:33:22] <panella32> https://imgur.com/a/Bama0hA
[02:34:50] <Evolver> Look at the preexisting work, like what I linked, etc. to see if they offer shortcuts via a pretrained model or clever techniques or something that's ready to use
[02:34:59] <panella32> Do you have any suggestion which solver can be more appropriate for this kind of captcha considering I don't know much about ML.
[02:35:13] <panella32> Thanks I'll check it out.
[02:35:53] <panella32> overall 5k is too low?
[02:36:16] <panella32> Just like to have a number in mind.
[02:36:37] <Evolver> 100 for each character, so 3600
[02:37:11] <Evolver> 5k should be fine
[02:37:52] <panella32> Ah great. Thank you again. 
[02:40:21] <Celelibi> It really depends on the model. Its sheer size and the training method you use.
[02:40:49] <Celelibi> Which in turn should be derived from the complexity of the task. But here, these captchas seem simple enough.
[02:40:54] <panella32> Evolver before coming here I was going to go with this repo https://github.com/coldnew/twse-captcha-solver-dl4j and make a relatively small dataset. I'm not sure how good it structured.
[02:40:54] <TitlesBot> 03⤷ GitHub - coldnew/twse-captcha-solver-dl4j: A deeplearning based captcha solver for http://bsr.twse.com.tw/bshtm/
[02:41:53] <Celelibi> I'm pretty sure on these captchas you could get a decent accuracy by just hand coding the tool.
[02:41:54] <panella32> Celelibi Thanks for the information. May I know what do you think of that repo and its method of training? Any helpful for my case?
[02:42:40] <Evolver> In your case, because there are a hundred ways in which to crack such an easy captcha, you'd want to focus on performance too
[02:42:44] <Evolver> so you can do it fast on a cheap cpu
[02:42:54] <Evolver> rather than use a giant model that is expensive to run
[02:43:55] <panella32> That's truth and I have never thought about the performance aspect of it. 
[02:44:57] <panella32> I wish there was a simple tool for that. I tried some OCR but it didn't manage to solve the captcha. But was very easy to use.
[02:45:10] *** Quits: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso) (Quit: I am not a quitter!)
[02:45:20] <Evolver> If it were simple, then it would be a totally useless captcha
[02:45:45] <Celelibi> panella32, it looks like the letters are usually easily separable. Then you have some gaussian blur and some shadow. You can't do anything about the blur (well, that's not entierly true), but you can easily detect and erase the shadow.
[02:46:07] <Evolver> Celelibi: how would you separate the two letters that look stuck together?
[02:46:19] <Celelibi> Then there's just a linear transformation remaining: shearing and rotating.
[02:46:45] <Celelibi> Evolver, That's why I said "usually". Those PN stuck together are harder.
[02:47:01] <panella32> what about the random angle of characters? can the letters be rotated or it's a complicated task that I'm not aware of?
[02:49:51] <Celelibi> When they're isolated and cleaned up, I'm sure most models would do the job.
[02:50:36] <Celelibi> But another way to go could be to find the font that's used. It's probably a very standard one. There are websites that ask you questions about the font and suggest font names.
[02:50:56] <panella32> (btw I've checked the source and I can safely confirm that in %75 of cases there no any stuck together characters. And I'm totally fine with that amount of accuracy just to make it more easier to do.)
[02:51:49] <panella32> Celelibi how knowing the font name can be helpful? 
[02:51:54] <Celelibi> If you have the font you can easily have a reference for the 36 characters.
[02:51:59] <Evolver> Two letters can still be vertically overlapping even if they're not stuck together
[02:51:59] <Celelibi> To compare to.
[02:52:18] <panella32> even with having the angles?
[02:52:30] <Evolver> Looks like Times New Roman or such
[02:52:31] <Celelibi> Evolver, if they're not touching you can isolate them by segmenting.
[02:53:24] <Celelibi> Yeah, looks like a very common font. I'm just not good at remembering their names. ^^
[02:55:43] <Celelibi> panella32, with reference characters, I guess you could either try to be smart and perform a gradient descent on the linear transformation matrix.
[02:56:13] <Celelibi> Or be stupid and fast and just generate 1000 examples with various linear transformations.
[02:56:23] <Celelibi> Then you can compare pixel by pixel.
[02:57:59] <Celelibi> panella32, how good are you are programming? Have you ever used opencv?
[02:58:00] <panella32> I'm not sure how complicated the first option would be but I'm down. Just need some blueprint on github or somewhere to see and learn how to perform a gradient descent on the linear transformation matrix.
[02:58:15] <panella32> Never nothing :)
[02:58:27] <panella32> Just some php & python!
[02:58:28] <Celelibi> Well, then this might be difficult.
[02:58:45] <Celelibi> Oh. If you're not entierly new to programming that's already something.
[03:00:13] <Evolver> The other theoretical way to solve it (without ML) is to crack its RNG
[03:00:23] <Evolver> but don't try that at home
[03:00:30] <panella32> RNG?!
[03:00:47] <Celelibi> panella32, I gotta tell you. Your problem looks interesting. Much more interesting than grading assignments as I should be doing right now. ^^
[03:00:51] <Evolver> the random number generator used to create the character sequence and transformation sequence
[03:01:15] <Celelibi> panella32, but your lack of experience makes me think you're up to something nasty here.
[03:02:05] <Celelibi> Evolver, nowadays, the default RNGs are pretty secure.
[03:02:49] <panella32> Celelibi much respect for you professor with your generous time. I do my best to figure it out whats the best approach to solve the captcha.
[03:02:52] <Celelibi> But I gotta say, it's always a delight to find a custom one and find some weakness. ^^
[03:03:51] <Celelibi> panella32, may I ask where those weak captchas come from?
[03:04:38] <panella32> I wish I could tell you but for several reasons honestly I'm not allowed.
[03:04:53] <Celelibi> You understand this looks shady, right?
[03:05:28] <panella32> the captcha itself or the case I'm looking for solving this captcha?
[03:05:47] <Celelibi> The fact that you're trying to break it.
[03:05:49] <Evolver> it's ok. it's a weak captcha anyway. real sites use differential equation problems.
[03:06:06] <panella32> Celelibi yes I admit it.
[03:06:30] <Evolver> Don't get in trouble for violating the CFAA
[03:06:31] <Celelibi> BTW, there are online services to solve captchas for you. With real indian people solving them for you.
[03:07:25] <Celelibi> But honnestly, it really looks like a shady business as well.
[03:09:13] <Evolver> Don't scrape at a high rate
[03:09:19] <Evolver> because that's the biggest path to getting IP blocked
[03:09:28] <Evolver> to gettin 429 errors
[03:10:23] <Evolver> so occasionally enter wrong answers too for the captcha
[03:10:40] <panella32> Celelibi I know you guys will have zero interest to help me knowing what kind of intention I could have but it's not a big deal you may think and it's just for myself and there's no business behind it. But I know you don't do it anyway.. 
[03:11:01] <Celelibi> Evolver, Depends which captcha service. One with such a weak captcha might not even have an IP ban system in place.
[03:11:24] <Evolver> Sometimes the webserver has a builtin ban feature
[03:11:28] <Evolver> at least a temp ban
[03:12:06] <Evolver> Celelibi: yeah I'm  amazed that anyone actually uses such a weak captcha
[03:12:20] <Evolver> because I've seen things nearly 20 years ago that were harder 
[03:13:08] <Celelibi> Yeah, this looks like the "hard captchas" of 20 years ago. Right when they started to make image transformations on the fly.
[03:13:48] <Celelibi> In custom systems, there were also sometimes some way to solve it without looking at the image.
[03:14:01] <panella32> Any chance @Evolver you help me somehow break it? This way the webmaster will eventually find out that they need a more secure captcha!!
[03:14:03] <Celelibi> Some would give your browser the answer in a cookie or in a hidden form field.
[03:14:31] <Celelibi> Sometimes hashed, sometimes just base64 encoded. ^^
[03:14:39] <Evolver> yeah look for this panella32 
[03:14:45] <Evolver> look at the image metadata too
[03:14:52] <Evolver> This is the haxor way
[03:15:44] <panella32> Actually it sends as a parameter of the body of the POST request. 
[03:15:52] <Evolver> Celelibi: There was this Nasdaq site that was blocking me with a captcha. I soon realized they block http 1.1 but not any other version of http. Problem solved.
[03:16:08] <Celelibi> lol
[03:16:11] <Evolver> Sometimes giving them a bullshit useragent is enough
[03:16:16] <Evolver> sometimes some other headers are needed
[03:16:42] <Celelibi> Yeah, user agent filtering. I see that a lot, even today.

[03:17:57] *** Joins: Codaraxis_ (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis)
[03:17:58] <Celelibi> Like for wget or curl. You often only have to put "mozilla" in your user-agent string when the download is refused.
[03:19:29] <Celelibi> panella32, here you're not looking for how your solution is sent to the server. You're looking if the server sends the solution to your browser at the same time as the captcha image.
[03:21:03] <panella32> I already sniffed all the https request made by the browser. But you right there might be some request having the answer as a header or in the body. idk
[03:21:16] <panella32> I'll check it out btw.
[03:21:17] <panella32> Celelibi speaking for programming experience may I know how much times does it take for you or a well experienced user to overcome this captcha with a decent accuracy?
[03:21:38] <panella32> for => of
[03:21:53] <panella32> times => time
[03:22:49] <Celelibi> I don't know. First version in maybe an hour or two because I don't have a lot of experience with opencv.
[03:23:17] <Celelibi> But then refining it to make it work better might take a few times that amount.
[03:23:48] <Celelibi> Also depends on the stupid bugs you spend waaaay too long to track.
[03:25:16] <panella32> wow just few hours. I already spent like tons of hours on github looking for a easy to use solution but almost all of them asking for a "training" step and I don't understand that step quite fine (mostly because they are not well explained)
[03:25:57] <Evolver> just watch some opencv tutorials then on youtube
[03:26:08] <Evolver> and don't worry about this problem while you watch them
[03:26:41] <Evolver> although there are a number of python packages for image processing
[03:26:53] <Celelibi> panella32, you look very new to ML. There's a lot of boilerplate knowledge to get before you can do anything with it.
[03:27:19] <panella32> Celelibi I'm capturing the traffic and hopefully it's not verified in server-side. Also maybe the answer is encoded base64 or something like that that's why I can't find it using "find" tool of fiddler..
[03:28:03] <panella32> Celelibi I know epsilon about ML. Doesn't know even print a "hello world" lmao
[03:28:04] <Celelibi> panella32, look for the obvious. Like a form field with type="hidden". Or a cookie value that change for every new captcha.
[03:28:14] <panella32> Evolver Thanks I'll check it out on youtube.
[03:34:46] <panella32> Celelibi there's no any hidden input in the html code and also there is only one property=value in the cookie (pcah=ejRKZ3NMMWpidkxwcmdpdXorL0pHRy9mdEljZjFUZmovajR4cDlRT3pERT0K)
[03:35:24] <panella32> I'm not sure if it's a just a generated string or an encoded version of something..
[03:35:53] <panella32> maybe google knows more about cookie: pcah=<somestring>
[03:36:05] <Celelibi> Check if it changes when you get another captcha. When you get another page without a captcha.
[03:36:22] <panella32> yes I checked and it changed 
[03:36:32] <panella32> Sorry.
[03:36:45] <Celelibi> For every page?
[03:37:06] <panella32> If I reload the page and load anthor captcha it changes. But let me see what happens for non-captcha pages..
[03:39:36] <Celelibi> BTW, it looks like some data encoded twice in base64.
[03:39:56] <Celelibi> 256 bits of data exactly.
[03:40:52] <Celelibi> Do you happen to know the captcha when you got this cookie?
[03:41:45] <panella32> I think for each and every request the pcah cookie changes. I can see that.
[03:41:56] <panella32> No matter the page has cookie or not.
[03:42:06] <Evolver> can continue this non-ML chat in #ml-ot
[03:42:37] <Celelibi> I think we'll just leave it at that.
[03:42:41] <panella32> there will be always a set-cookie in response header always.
[03:43:02] <panella32> Celelibi bad news we can't continue. I know you don't have too much spare time..
[03:43:52] <Celelibi> I hope you learned something and wish you well in your endeavor.
[03:44:40] <panella32> Thanks for your time and it was really helpful because you gave me some insight what I need to do. Thanks again.
[03:44:54] <panella32> Also thanks to @Evolver for his ideas.
