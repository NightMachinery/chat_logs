[00:06:59] <llua> it did the correct thing, executing echo ls /

[00:07:37] <jensen> are there any caveats if i explcitly export $HOST? i use bash as secondary shell to debug since all my scripts are in sh/bash. bash uses $HOSTNAME instead of $HOST which is not reliable for zsh. otherwise, hostname binary is the most reliable but calls an external process which is unnecessary if simply exporting $HOST on zsh works

[00:20:43] <jensen> my simple needs of simply having commands/scripts do X/Y depending on the machine and also considering if there are situations where bash inheriting $HOST/$HOSTNAME from zsh's $HOST is ill-advised

[00:43:10] <cassepipe> llua: It's just an exercise. I have to write a basic shell that behaves like bash.
[00:43:32] <cassepipe> I thought it would be a good time to learn some basic shell scripting in order to run tests
[00:44:02] <cassepipe> But I wanted to write with zsh, because it's the cool (no so) new thing
[00:44:18] <larryv> you're, uh, putting a lot on your plate
[00:44:32] <cassepipe> larryv: Gotta start somewhere
[00:44:48] <cassepipe> larryv: At least it motivates me for learning
[00:45:03] <cassepipe> I get to learn concept and to practice scripting
[00:45:43] <larryv> ok. if you were writing this scaffold in bash at least you'd be learning the scripting language that you actually have to imitate, but you do you
[00:46:03] <larryv> this is closer to what you intend: diff =(./my_shell =($@) ) =(/usr/bin/bash =($@) )
[00:46:10] <larryv> just ... call both in the same way
[00:47:32] <cassepipe> larryv: I only have to implement pipelines and redirections
[00:47:50] <cassepipe> larryv: Thanks for the tip. Yes it seems better

[00:56:59] <cassepipe> Oh right as you said it will expand to the first word only
[00:57:34] <larryv> no, it will expand to all the args
[00:58:03] <larryv> but the way you were using it before, only the first one ends up mattering. and even if you fixed that, the shells would still not be running the same commands

[01:51:04] <brocellous> I'm considering creating a git repo in my home directory for the purpose of tracking dotfiles

[01:51:26] <larryv> brocellous: the disable-patterns style
[01:51:42] <larryv> there is an example in zshcontrib(1)
[01:51:54] <Mikachu> you can also just check yourself before calling vcs_info
[01:51:56] <brocellous> Yes I tried disable-pattern, but it disables based on PWD, not repo root
[01:52:09] <brocellous> cd if I cd ~/somedir it displays again
[01:52:29] <Mikachu> since it's called "patterns" did you try putting a * at the end?
[01:52:29] <brocellous> somedir-that-is-not-also-a-git-repo
[01:52:46] <brocellous> wouldn't that disable it for every repo under my home dir?
[01:52:56] <Mikachu> is your homedir a git repo?
[01:52:57] <brocellous> that's where all the git repos I want to use it for are
[01:53:15] <Mikachu> that feels extremely dangerous
[01:53:23] <Mikachu> eg, if you think you're in a git repo but you're not, and you run git reset --hard or something
[01:53:54] <Mikachu> anyway, in that case you probably need to check yourself since the condition is pretty complicated

[05:03:42] <llua> cat just happens to be what reads from it
[05:04:27] <dg1727> Although your code sample doesn't actually show that the "echo bar" phrase has a valid stdin, do I understand right?
[05:05:28] <llua> > print foo | { { echo bar>&3; cat } 3>&-; echo baz; }
[05:05:28] <machabot> llua: /dev/stdin:1: 3: bad file descriptor
[05:05:28] <machabot> llua: foo
[05:05:28] <machabot> llua: baz
[05:05:55] <dg1727> Thanks, that makes sense.  Anyway, the 3>&- is supposed to be a modifier to a {} I take it?
[05:07:01] <llua> its just redirection, it can be applied to compound commands just like simple commands
[05:08:02] <llua> > if true; then echo hello; echo world; fi > /dev/null
[05:08:02] <machabot> llua: No output, exitstatus: 0
[05:09:12] <dg1727> OK
[05:09:33] <dg1727> I meant, as opposed to being a separate command on a line of its own

[05:11:35] <dg1727> I was trying to use  3>&-  on a line of its own, which seems to be why it was closing stdin
[05:12:23] <llua> 3>&1 on a line of its own will invoke $READNULLCMD, usually cat or less

[05:16:13] <dg1727> Is there a way to modify the  3>&-  syntax to accomplish that?
[05:16:40] <llua> if input is coming in on a fd that you want to ignore, the idiom of way of doing that is sending it to /dev/null
[05:16:56] <dg1727> I don't want to ignore the input; I want to close the output
[05:17:23] <llua> which does the same thing, in a more aggressive way
[05:17:37] <dg1727> I thought the input & output were independent of each other?

[05:21:28] <llua> that doesn't do what you claim
[05:21:45] <dg1727> I don't claim that it does.  I'm wondering what syntax will do what I'm hoping to do here.

[05:23:14] <dg1727> The inner closing '}' will close fd 3 perhaps?
[05:23:29] <llua> its only open for output_cmd, not even the inner {}
[05:24:29] <dg1727> I also want a syntax such that I can write line after line to a named pipe & an EOF will propagate to the reading process only when I choose

[16:37:20] <cassepipe> osse: Oh right. 
[16:37:27] <cassepipe> osse: Trying to get my head around that
[16:39:17] <cassepipe> So something like :  diff =($MINISHELL < =(echo $@) =(/usr/bin/bash < =(echo $@))
[16:39:26] <cassepipe> Would that work ?
[16:39:48] <cassepipe> Where MINISHELL is my toy shell program 
[16:39:56] <osse> I don't see why not
[16:40:02] <danielsh> because echo
[16:40:19] <danielsh> (interprets escapes.  use <<<) 
[16:40:21] <cassepipe> Out of curiosity is there a way not to need the echo ?
[16:40:40] <osse> cassepipe: but someshell -c "$@" and someshell < file are interpreted differently

[16:41:48] <osse> what about it?
[16:41:55] <cassepipe> danielsh: Not sure I get your point
[16:42:13] <cassepipe> diff =($MINISHELL < =(echo $@) =(/usr/bin/bash < =(echo $@)
[16:42:35] <cassepipe> This works but is there a way I can get rid of echo ?
[16:43:00] <osse> what is $@?  is it just a string? an array?
[16:43:21] <cassepipe> osse: In zsh I was told it was an array
[16:43:40] <osse> you're the one filling it up, so you have to know
[16:43:58] <danielsh> cassepipe, echo isn't safe for arbitrary input
[16:44:01] <osse> but as it stands, it'll get munched anyway, so you can do $MINISHELL <<< "$@"
[16:44:09] <danielsh> so do what osse just said
[16:44:28] <osse> which is the same as what danielsh said
