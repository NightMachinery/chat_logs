[00:00:38] <pyzozord> can I summarize it like this: pointer or not I can define only one method with that signature for a receiver
[00:01:17] <pyzozord> and when calling method on a value it will be automatically upgraded to value or a pointer depending on how the method was declared
[00:02:17] <pyzozord> ?
[00:02:27] <fizzie> Well, almost. There is that distinction on what the types' method sets are like that I've been trying to bring up. In one direction it is just changing the call, but in the other it's not.
[00:03:29] <b0nn> The method set understanding is correct
[00:03:55] <b0nn> That is, one signature no matter what the type of receiver
[00:04:26] <pyzozord> i am confusied about method sets, don't know what they are, I don't think they were mentined so far here https://go.dev/tour/methods/19
[00:04:40] <fizzie> `func (t T) Foo()` makes `Foo()` a method in the method sets of `T` and `*T`, so both types implement `interface { Foo() }`. Conversely, `func (t *T) Foo()` makes `Foo()` a method only in the method set of `*T`, so only the pointer type implements that interface. But a _call_ like `var t T; t.Foo()` is still legal, and acts like the call `(&t).Foo()`.
[00:05:05] <b0nn> The ability to call a method defeined on a pointer receiver depends on the type of the caller, and you can magic your way in
[00:05:22] <fizzie> Yeah, maybe the tour writers thought it's a little overly abstract. But that's how the language specification defines it.

[00:05:56] <fizzie> https://go.dev/ref/spec#Method_sets: "A type has a (possibly empty) method set associated with it. The method set of an interface type is its interface. The method set of any other type T consists of all methods declared with receiver type T. The method set of the corresponding pointer type *T is the set of all methods declared with receiver *T or T (that is, it also contains the method set of
[00:05:58] <fizzie> T)."
[00:06:23] <b0nn> A pointer type can call all of the methods, but the ones defined with value receivers will behave as though they are dealing with a value type
[00:06:46] <mrig> There really is only one case for which you want a method on a pointer and not on a receiver, and all this is just a formalisation that fits that bill.
[00:09:25] <mrig> not on a value rather, when you want to mutate it without returning by value.

[00:18:10] <b0nn> It might be helpful to remember that the receivers is syntactical sugar
[00:18:48] <b0nn> really the call is (from memory) func Foo (RECEIVER, ...)
[00:19:07] <pyzozord> what is the point of `func (t T) Foo()` making `Foo()` a method in the method sets of `T` and `*T`. Why add method to *T method set? Why not just convert all t *T; t.Method() to (*t).Method()
[00:19:24] <mrig> This also relates indirectly to whether the heap or stack is used, you can avoid needing the heap oftentimes, by simply returning by value.

[01:04:57] <fizzie> You're missing the `.i` part at the end.
[01:05:19] <pyzozord> ah so & has lower precendence than .i
[01:06:57] <fizzie> Yeah. `(&struct...)` is a pointer to a struct; `(&struct...).i` is an int (using the fact that field selection implicitly dereferences the pointer); and `&(&struct...).i` is an *int.
[01:07:56] <fizzie> I used to write it as `&(*&struct{ i int }{123}).i` earlier, which is nice, because you'd kind of think that should be exactly the same as `&(struct{ i int }{123}).i` but it isn't.
[01:08:06] <pyzozord> ah the implicit dereference threw me off for a moment
[01:08:33] <pyzozord> also interesting that &struct{ i int }{123}.i is illegal but p := struct{ i int }{123}.i; &p is legal

[01:11:58] <fizzie> C allows `&(int){123}` because C's compound literals can be of scalar type (though the anonymous object's lifetime might not be sufficient), but Go's composite literals only allow struct/slice/map/array types, so you can't just write `&int{123}` or something.
[01:14:33] <fizzie> There's a proposal out there to add a syntax for that, though last I looked at it, they were talking about extending `new` to allow initializing the value. So you'd write (I think) `new(int, 123)` to get that.

[01:19:17] <fizzie> mrig: But the point is, you have to have the inner &: `&(struct{ i int }{123}).i` is *not* legal.

[01:40:29] <_cyclops_> Hi all - i'm fairly new to go, and i'm more an OO programmer. I'm working on a set of small tools that basically act as little micro services. The thing is that  i have a main function and some logic in there (like command line parameters and so on). That main function is /mostly/ the same for the a number of the programs and i would like to understand how i can avoid copy/pasting the code into each program

And indeed the latest version of https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes/typed/apps/v1#DeploymentInterface has a method `Create(ctx context.Context, deployment *v1.Deployment, opts metav1.CreateOptions)` but your call on the line you link to doesn't have thta many parameters.

[02:14:59] <sztanpet> a slice is just https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#SliceHeader behind the scenes, that is what gets copied
[02:15:14] <fizzie> That's the semantics, yes. Of course as an empty struct, there isn't exactly anything to copy.
[02:16:47] <b0nn> hrm it's *not* a slice header

[02:18:21] <pyzozord> well I don't really know any of the languages you listed so I can't say
[02:18:39] <pyzozord> but in javascript actually things get copied only shallowly
[02:18:41] <fizzie> Isn't what grossly inefficient?
[02:18:54] <b0nn> variable length arrays, as you may know from C - just cannot happen in memory - because otherwise an infinite amount of memory needs to be reserved to allow a slice to grow

[02:19:12] <b0nn> The growth is O(1)
[02:19:31] <fizzie> Depends on what the "entire struct" contains.
[02:19:38] <fizzie> In this case, it's a `struct {}`, so no.
[02:19:51] <fizzie> If you think it's big, you can of course always use a pointer receiver.
[02:20:19] <pyzozord> right
[02:20:38] <sztanpet> but first, its best to measure, because the indirection introduced by the pointer might be more than the overhead of copying it would be

[02:26:08] <pyzozord> I am trying to do a while loop

[02:28:00] <fizzie> Strictly speaking, `for n, err := Read(); /* some condition */; n, err = Read() { ... }` is also an option, but repeating the call is just ugly.
[02:30:28] <pyzozord> yep
[02:31:05] <fizzie> I confess I sometimes wish there'd be a `for` statement variant that has a single semicolon, and made `for InitStmt; Condition { ... }` equivalent to `for { InitStmt; if !Condition { break }; ... }`. It'd almost be consistent with `if` and `switch` and the other control structures that can take an initial short declaration.

[02:35:20] <fizzie> I guess it'd admittedly be a little confusing if `for X; Y { ... }` did run X every time around, but `for X; Y; { ... }` didn't.
[02:35:50] <fizzie> No, `range` only works over strings, slices, maps, channels and arrays.

[14:02:59] <evilop> {} format is imo much nicer
[14:07:42] <evilop> "{pkgname}/{pkgver}-{pkgrel}\n    Date: {pkgdate}" vs "%s/%s-%s\n    Date: %s"  since go doesn't have a syntax for named replacement

[14:18:19] <evilop> python has a syntax for naming things with % formating, but its somewhat horrible
[14:18:22] <fizzie> fmt.Sprint(name, "/", version, "-", release, "\n    Date: ", date) is an option.
[14:18:52] <evilop> fizzie: but not when you want to define the template one place and then (re)use it in another
[14:19:05] <fizzie> As is "text/template", with all its overhead, but once it gets to multi-line things I don't think it's unwarranted.
[14:19:35] <fizzie> I don't think string interpolation usually works "when you want to define the template one place and then (re)use it in another".
[14:20:30] <evilop> in the case of rust 1.58 its not like f"" strings, it just got the ability to capture the local scope
[14:20:54] <evilop> can still reuse with passing in explicitly

[17:48:13] <fizzie> Not sure how that'd work, since the type of the key is part of the type of the map. If you have a `map[uint64]T`, its keys must be `uint64`s, and if you have a `map[myuint64]T` its keys must be `myuint64`s, so converting them to anything else "in place" wouldn't really make sense. And if it's a `map[interface{}]T`, then uint64(0) and myuint64(0) would just be different keys.

[22:44:45] <borring> Dus10: You'll need to do it in 2 separate steps.. First create a slice of strings, then `append()` to it.
[22:46:36] <borring> I don't think it's possible to do everything in a single "line" like you're going for.. Unless you make some kind of transformation function to turn those keys into a slice

[23:47:25] <b0nn> twaapo: can I ask why you are wanting a more human friendly key?
[23:48:04] <b0nn> I'm thinking that you transform input/output from the human readable format to the internal representation during your read/write functions

[23:57:24] <b0nn> You can write your own custom marshal/unmarshal
