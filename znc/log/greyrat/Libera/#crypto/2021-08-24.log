[02:43:08] <snappy> what is import secrets, does that contain a secure rng?
[02:43:20] <Peng> Yes.
[02:43:41] <Peng> It's a new wrapper for Python'
[02:43:48] <Peng> It's a new wrapper for Python's random.SystemRandom() class.
[02:44:21] <Alipha> So it falls back to mersenne twister if it can't import secrets?
[02:44:22] <ms7821> I thought ESR was driven out of the python community
[02:48:19] <Peng> Yes. secrets is new-ish, added in Python 3.6 with a backported version available on PyPI
[02:48:48] <Peng> the Mersenne Twister PRNG is seeded with a CSPRNG if possible (/dev/urandom / getrandom / getentropy / CryptGenRandom)
[02:49:00] <Peng> I don't know what it's seeded with on weird OSes
[02:49:04] <Peng> if any still exist
[02:49:22] <Alipha> How big of a seed does it accept?
[02:53:43] <Peng> For me, using strace, Python 2.7 seems to read 2500 bytes from /dev/urandom by default, and 3.8 reads 2496 bytes with getrandom().
[02:53:56] <Peng> I dunno if it uses 'em all!
[02:54:12] <ericonr> Peng: why don't they at least use the random.SystemRandom class?
[02:54:42] <ericonr> falling back to unavailable module is ~fine, since it's a "recent" addition, but using a bad RNG kinda sucks :/
[02:55:26] <Peng> ericonr: Purpoted OSes where the bad implementation works and the good implementation doesn't that are using an old version of Python.
[02:56:31] <ericonr> lmao
[02:56:33] <ericonr> ok
[02:56:58] <ericonr> Peng: secrets.py literally just wraps around SystemRandom
[02:56:58] <Alipha> So it's not using the current system time to seed?
[02:57:07] <ericonr> maybe that's a good argument to use ?
[02:57:15] <Peng> I think it may have been changed by accident -- it used to use random.SystemRandom() -- honestly.
[02:57:27] <Peng> ericonr: Maybe they'll just stop using secrets...
[02:57:41] <ericonr> "to keep consistent with python 3.6+ secrets, use SystemRandom in the fallback"
[02:57:45] <Peng> Alipha: It's seeded securely if possible. I assume it seeds poorly on weird OSes, but I haven't looked at how.
[02:57:49] <ericonr> or just always use SystemRandom, that works too
[02:58:11] <ericonr> hm, is mersenne twister considered safe if seeded properly?
[02:58:17] <ericonr> I thought it still wouldn't be
[02:58:45] <ms7821> it's safe until you start using its output
[02:58:58] <Peng> If you read a small amount of output I doubt it's practically exploitable.
[02:59:04] <Peng> But it's still a no-no.
[02:59:11] <Peng> And I'm not a cryptographer anyway. :P
[03:02:40] <mmlj4> so if I have a luks device, and the filesystem or partition it lives on gets corrupted... fsck might be able to fix it, but what does that mean for the data inside the encrypted luks container? will most of it still exist, or does it go *poof* ?
[03:02:47] <Peng> ericonr: I thought about making the "secrets.py literally just wraps around SystemRandom" argument, but didn't at the time, and I'm not sure I can phrase it politely now.
[03:03:33] <ericonr> ms7821: lol
[03:03:45] <ericonr> Peng: I leave the politicking to you :p
[03:03:54] <Peng> Noooooooooooooooooooo
[03:10:24] <Alipha> Is this a util that generates a key once per run? ie, only generates one key per time it's seeded
[03:12:57] <sarnold> mmlj4: it depends if the block was a data block in a file, or unused space, or some important filesystem metadata
[03:13:13] <mmlj4> fair enough, thanks
[03:17:27] <Peng> Alipha: It generates 20 keys, I think.
[03:17:57] <Peng> I'm not sure how much it reads from the PRNG. Likely a 32-bit int per output character, but I dunno.
[03:18:22] <Peng> Or output two-characters, for the hex-encoded part.
[03:18:30] <Peng> Alipha: It might generate 10 keys, I'm not sure what the implementation is.
[03:18:59] <Alipha> Peng: so potentially if someone had some of the keys, they could predict the rest?
[03:19:39] <Peng> Alipha: Yes, but an expert would have to figure out how practical that is.
[03:19:59] <Peng> E.g. if you expose 20 bytes from a Mersenne Twister, that's probably not useful for reconstruction the state?
[03:20:15] <Peng> Only in a "2^impossible to smaller but also 2^impossible" way
[03:20:20] <Peng> <- not an expert
[03:21:50] <Peng> One of NTPsec's first alleged design principles was to remove support for old OSes so that they could improve and simplify the code, but apparently that's more flexible now. :P
[03:22:20] <Peng> (Of course, taking a hack-and-slash approach to code also introduces serious bugs and security bugs sometimes, while fixing many others.)

[03:38:34] <sarnold> when I read through the chrony sources I don't think I found *any* bugs, or maybe just piddly things that were unlikely to actually be problems. That's just so rare.
[03:38:40] <sarnold> oops.
[03:38:48] <Peng> They had accidentally introduced it during a hack-and-slash refactoring, and accidentally fixed it during another hack-and-slash refactoring a few months later.
[03:39:06] <sarnold> that's the bazaar, baby!
[03:40:28] <Peng> NTPsec was really buggy back in 2017. (But I was running it from Git, not stable releases.) Which is half fair, and half exposes their cowboy development approach.

[18:00:01] <ms7821> Peng, that is some super sus code
[18:00:26] <ms7821> dude has literally removed the logic that makes it safe

[18:03:17] *** Quits: LiSyn (~lisyn@user/deepspace-link) ()
[18:04:13] <Peng> Yeah, I was really confused by that comment, until I noticed that it used to use SystemRandom. :D
[18:04:33] <Peng> I'd totally missed that the old code used SystemRandom the first time I read the diff.
[18:08:24] <piou> "The seed is ignored by random.SystemRandom" -> could it be that the only reason for the change is the dude wanting to have a deterministically seeded PRNG for his tests?
[18:09:09] <Peng> From what was written on GitLab, I think the change was an accident, TBH
[18:09:40] <ms7821> just seems typical of the code in this project
[18:10:10] <ms7821> the whole "let's pick characters between 0x24 and 0x7e because our keyfiles have comments starting #" instead of just using base64
