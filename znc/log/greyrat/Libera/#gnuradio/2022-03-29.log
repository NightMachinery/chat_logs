[05:33:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> Could also be baseband low-level stuff.  If you're operating very close to the bottom end of the ADC range, your outside signal isn't adequately swamping internal effects.  On the other hand, too much gain can cause intermod effects.

[21:56:45] <subspace1486[m]> hey everyone. I'm trying to understand how to extract symbols from a binary-FSK receiver that I am developing in GNU Radio. I can properly demodulate and filter the signal, and I have 8 bits per baud. Visually it all looks correct and reliable. I have figured out how to use the Correlation Estimator block to tag the beginning of the known preamble. However, I simply do not understand the Symbol Sync block enough to reliably decimate
[21:56:45] <subspace1486[m]> it down to the 1s and 0s of the symbols. Is this the best place to ask about this?

[22:01:25] <subspace1486[m]> This is the flowgraph that I have so far. There's a bit more below where I take the symbol stream and dump it into a file and to the GUI.
[22:03:47] <subspace1486[m]> I've never done this before, feel free to criticize and call me out if I'm taking a poor approach. I'm attempting to build this thing to be relatively generic and fairly sensitive to a lower SNR if possible. I'm confident that all the blocks are working reliably all the way up until the Symbol Sync block, as I simply do not understand this block or the involved math enough to known how to properly utilize it. The Correlation
[22:03:47] <subspace1486[m]> Estimator block is correctly tagging the start of the preamble though.

[22:41:07] <subspace1486[m]> Thanks. I can upload the GRC file if you want, I think everything here so far matches up with the blog posts and StackOverflow posts that I've seen, and I think my math in the Translating FIR Filter and the Demodulation blocks works, I'm just uncertain about the Symbol Sync or other methods of extracting the bits
[22:41:42] <funkylab[m]> so, can you maybe share a picture form your "Filtered Signal" sink?
[22:41:52] <subspace1486[m]> I have a working FSK transmitter as well, so the clock sync problem is the last piece before I can put them together into a larger tool
[22:42:35] <funkylab[m]> it'd probably be best to first test the transmitter directly connected to your receiver before inserting real-world transmit and receive hardware :)

[22:43:24] <subspace1486[m]> That's demodulated, and that's the preamble. -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, ...
[22:43:49] <funkylab[m]> nice!
[22:45:12] <subspace1486[m]> I had also tried a moving average, but the low-pass filter is doing a pretty decent job. The only downside is that I have this magic number of 6 as the gain setting in the block, as it seems to get the numbers up to -1 and 1

[22:46:55] <subspace1486[m]> The Correlator block is correctly tagging the start of the preamble, which I defined as eight 0s followed by that -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, ... pattern
[22:47:20] <funkylab[m]> but your receiver won't care about the actual amplitude being 1
[22:47:27] <funkylab[m]> it will just decide based on whether the number is positive or negative
[22:47:39] <funkylab[m]> so, don't worry too much about the gain
[22:47:46] <funkylab[m]> (we can do that later on, still)

[22:52:06] <subspace1486[m]> the wiki said I needed to use a pointer, but I don't have any idea how to state that in the parameter
[22:52:11] <funkylab[m]> nah
[22:52:42] <funkylab[m]> that's fine. But you really shouldn't have to use the `samp_per_sym` repetition of every element
[22:53:02] <funkylab[m]> the interpolation should be done by the correlation estimator, seeing that it has knowledge of the number of samples per symbol
[22:53:24] <subspace1486[m]> but I need to repeat that bit samp_per_sym times, not the whole sequence samp_per_sym times

[22:54:09] <subspace1486[m]> Is this decent? I honestly know very little about the math here
[22:54:56] <subspace1486[m]> hold on, digital.constellation_bpsk().base() shouldn't even be in there, this is an FSK signal, not PSK
[22:55:02] <subspace1486[m]> I don't know know where that came from
[22:55:48] <subspace1486[m]> now it doesn't run, as it does need a constellation...
[22:56:00] <funkylab[m]> funkylab[m]: scratch that, you need to do it the way you're currently doing it, judging by the source code of the correlation est
[22:56:17] <funkylab[m]> subspace1486[m]: it is PSK at that point!
[22:56:30] <subspace1486[m]> huh? its a square wave
[22:56:34] <funkylab[m]> BPSK, to be exact: you're looking for values that are +1 or -1 (or scaled versions of that)
[22:57:02] <subspace1486[m]> okay, I put that back in
[22:57:23] <subspace1486[m]> do the rest of the factors seem okay to you?
[22:57:42] <subspace1486[m]> I know TED Gain is the tricky one that requires some kind of analysis outside of GNU Radio
[22:59:58] <funkylab[m]> kinda, I'd not use Mueller and Müller here, as it's [kind of a very binary approach](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/discuss-gnuradio/2015-07/msg00610.html) to synchronization, but it should work. I think you should further reduce your Loop bandwidth – it defines how quickly your synchronizer is able to "jump onto" a signal that does symbol transistions once in a while, but the higher the bandwidth, the more likely you will also fall
[22:59:58] <funkylab[m]> prey to noise or be sensitive to long streaks of identical symbols.
[23:02:22] <subspace1486[m]> Okay, I dropped it down to 2 * math.pi * 0.02
[23:02:38] <subspace1486[m]> what detector would you suggest instead?
[23:03:04] <funkylab[m]> go down by another factor of 10! 
[23:03:21] <funkylab[m]> subspace1486[m]: you have a nice SNR, try Gardner, it should take the same parameters

[23:05:31] <funkylab[m]> subspace1486[m]: oh, that's no good!

[23:06:01] <funkylab[m]> ah, thinking about this, your burst might simply be too short for the symbol sync to converge in that time
[23:07:33] <funkylab[m]> the output looks really confusing to me
[23:07:34] <funkylab[m]> hm
[23:09:00] <subspace1486[m]> this is 2400 baud, and there's around 880 bits total from all three packets of data
[23:09:33] <BjoernKerler[m]> did you have a look at the gr-satellite workshop video ?
[23:10:03] <subspace1486[m]> I have not, but I'd like to. I'm currently setting up a mast to hold a rotatable log-periodic antenna for satellite use
[23:10:10] <BjoernKerler[m]> daniel explained some some stuff on these things
[23:10:18] <BjoernKerler[m]> s/some/quite/
[23:11:16] <BjoernKerler[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDbs6l4rMhs
[23:11:19] <BjoernKerler[m]> this might help
[23:11:46] <subspace1486[m]> I feel a bit challenged because I'm so used to thinking about things algorithmically. I think "okay, we've tagged the start of the preamble, and we know the baud rate, can't we just extract that part of the stream and start pulling symbols?" but I know that there's a lot more to it
[23:12:41] <BjoernKerler[m]> yep. it's all about hints and tricks. daniel had quite some in that video.
[23:13:32] <BjoernKerler[m]> and even it's its not explained enough, daniel's clearly the guy who can tell you what you need to do :)
[23:14:02] <subspace1486[m]> I'll have to watch the thing, 2 hour video lol
[23:14:31] <BjoernKerler[m]> yep, watched it yesterday. he also published his blocks.
[23:14:55] <subspace1486[m]> I suspect I've just got poor parameters in my Symbol Sync block, I think examples like this will really help
[23:15:42] <BjoernKerler[m]> is your signal centered to 1 ?
[23:15:52] <subspace1486[m]> yes
[23:16:16] <subspace1486[m]> wait, it's centered at 0
[23:16:40] <subspace1486[m]> it's demodulated at that point, so it's shifting above and below 0
[23:17:07] <BjoernKerler[m]> sps 8 ? sounds very low
[23:17:26] <funkylab[m]> BjoernKerler[m]: why?
[23:17:35] <subspace1486[m]> I can easily set it to 16 or whatever, I had read that the Symbol Sync had issues if it was above 8

[23:21:02] <BjoernKerler[m]> what happens if you use the constellation plot ?
[23:21:28] <BjoernKerler[m]> is it circling around ?
[23:21:32] <subspace1486[m]> instead of a time sync?
[23:21:36] <BjoernKerler[m]> yes
[23:21:40] <subspace1486[m]> time sink
[23:21:53] <subspace1486[m]> let me see. You want that after the Symbol Sync block?
[23:22:00] <subspace1486[m]> or right after demodulation?
[23:22:41] <BjoernKerler[m]> after symbol sink
[23:22:47] <subspace1486[m]> ok
[23:23:09] <BjoernKerler[m]> screenshot would help of course :D

[23:25:33] <BjoernKerler[m]> funkylab: my mistake, I saw 3.62904 in daniel's sample, which is of course lower than 8
[23:26:08] <BjoernKerler[m]> mhmmm that doesn't look that good ...
[23:27:17] <BjoernKerler[m]> let me show you how it should look like (according to daniel's course)

[23:30:25] <BjoernKerler[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Simulation_example:_BPSK_Demodulation
[23:30:50] <subspace1486[m]> Just to confirm, I'm picking up a binary-FSK signal, demodulating it into a square wave, running that through a filter, correlating the preamble, and then trying to extract the symbols, and this pattern should be a PSK signal at this point that can draw a scatter on this plot?
[23:31:09] <BjoernKerler[m]> I'd say clock recovery failed or low pass filter options, just a guess
[23:32:03] <subspace1486[m]> <subspace1486[m]> "image.png" <- Here's the demodulated signal after the low-pass filter
[23:32:28] <subspace1486[m]> I'm just stuck on this clock recovery steps
[23:33:00] <subspace1486[m]> and the Correlator block does seem decently reliable at identifying the start of the preamble, but somehow after that the recovery falls apart
[23:35:13] <subspace1486[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Guided_Tutorial_PSK_Demodulation#Recovering_Timing hmm

[23:38:08] <BjoernKerler[m]> sorry, my gnuradio install is currently broken, I need to fix it first before I can be of any help, lol.
[23:39:55] <BjoernKerler[m]> is that signal something you've taken from the radio with noise ? If yes, do you use some sort of agc ?
[23:40:49] <BjoernKerler[m]> the constellation plot looks like you have a lot of noise in between
[23:41:15] *** Quits: jacobk (~quassel@utdpat242030.utdallas.edu) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:43:11] <BjoernKerler[m]> ok, now I'm confused. I assumed you have a bpsk signal, but now I see you mean fsk signal.
[23:43:22] <BjoernKerler[m]> then ignore all I've said before
[23:43:47] <funkylab[m]> well, the output of the quadrature demod is BPSK, effectively
[23:43:57] <funkylab[m]> (not the thing on the air, though)
[23:45:44] <BjoernKerler[m]> if it is bpsk, then the signal is too noisy because it doesn't seem to be centered around 1 / -1, but all over the place between 1 - -1
[23:46:22] <funkylab[m]> <subspace1486[m]> "Here's the demodulated signal..." <- looks pretty good, doesn't it?
[23:47:10] <funkylab[m]> my working assumption is that with proper symbol synchronization, you'd hit the +-1 spots
[23:49:12] <BjoernKerler[m]> haven't seen any frequency plot. based on the time plot it looks good.
[23:51:44] <BjoernKerler[m]> but I think funkylab is right :)
[23:52:22] <funkylab[m]> sadly, I'll have to take my leave for tonight
