[01:11:37] <Bayes> was hoping for a nicer way to scale a matrix blockwise than this https://pastebin.com/raw/KmQKVTwf

[18:21:16] <Kabouik> Say I have a series of temperature data over several years and want to calculate the longest period of consecutive days > 40°C, how would I proceed?
[18:22:03] <Kabouik> Ideally I would like to return each series of consecutive days > 40, and in another column add the date, so that I can rank those series by year or month
[18:22:52] <fendur> Kabouik: could create a logical column (T/F) with the test, and then use rle to find the runs and manipulate them
[18:23:15] <Bayes> Kabouik oof I want to say there must be something specialized for that, a function call that would give you your result one line
[18:23:17] <Kabouik> Ha, that is exactly what I was currently investigsating, but didn't find how to return the dates with it
[18:24:13] <Bayes> some wild thoughts: cumsum(ifelse(temp > 40)) should give you a vector like this 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6,
[18:24:17] <Kabouik> I was going with `rle(df %>% mutate(Temp = ifelse(Temp >= 40, 1, 0)) %>% filter(Month == 8) %>% select(Temp))`, but then didn't know how to get further
[18:24:41] <Kabouik> Oh right, cumsum is a good idea Bayes
[18:24:47] <Bayes> and diff(ifelse(temp > 40)) should give you 1 when the series enters and abandons the 40 threshold
[18:26:45] <fendur> i think you're going to end up recreating rle with that route
[18:26:50] <Bayes> also I just learned there's something rle
[18:26:54] <Bayes> yeah didn't know that existed
[18:26:55] <Bayes> xd
[18:27:19] <Bayes> rickyrick do you know of any sensible method to find blocks in a correlation matrix?
[18:27:31] <Kabouik> I'm not sure how to rank longest series with rle and show another variable (Date) with it so that I can tell when was the longest series
[18:31:49] <Bayes> extract all Date subvectors s.t. temp > 40, compute the length and date of every Date subvector
[18:32:19] <Bayes> (talking off my head here, disregard if doesn't make much sense)
[18:35:23] <Kabouik> Hum turns out I'm not there yet, my rle object just lists a length of 1 and the TRUE/FALSE values, but not the length of consecutive identical values
[18:35:51] <Bayes> if you really need more specific advise, you'll need to share a mwe I'm afraid
[18:39:47] <Kabouik> Here is what I have Bayes: https://p.teknik.io/Simple/JYOd0
[18:40:38] <Kabouik> But I don't understand the lengths of the rle object, there's only one value in it
[18:41:30] <Kabouik> Maybe increase the sd to 5 just in case, to increase the likelihood of consecutive rows >40

[19:09:11] <Bayes> okay, np Kabouik but that's the same idea
[19:09:18] <Bayes> so rle will give you a list with two elements
[19:09:35] <Bayes> if you feed rle a named vector, it will keep the names
[19:09:56] <Bayes> so if you use your Dates as names, you'll get the dates back ^_^
[19:10:00] <Bayes> which is what you want to do
[19:10:10] <Bayes> allegedly
[19:11:04] <Kabouik> That is what I want indeed, but somehow the counting of series of consecutive values seems off at the moment, I have years with 717 days of consecutive air temperature apparently :p
[19:11:23] <Kabouik> 717 days > 40°C
[19:11:27] <Kabouik> In one year!
[19:11:35] <Bayes> crazy, I was just trying to do something I couldn't figure out, was googling it and the first answer I found says "use rle for this" xD
[19:11:39] <Kabouik> That was an unusually warm year.
[19:12:03] <Kabouik> Same, I was investigating it before asking here because I was kind of clueless with how to use rle()
[19:12:19] <Bayes> `cumsum(rle(x)$lengths) + 1` that returns me where a sequence changes values, awesome
[19:12:29] <Bayes> time to add that snippet to my personal notes :D
[19:16:36] <confuzeus> Kabouik: if you cannot get the hang of rle, you can trivially implement something to achieve that with the advantage that you increase your r horizon.

[19:36:00] <Bayes> match doesn't pop in my mind as often as it should

[20:35:26] <Kabouik> But I need somehow to add an extra column with the corresponding year to that table
[20:45:36] <confuzeus> you need to think carefully. like what happens if it is span over two years?
[20:48:24] <Kabouik> I thought about it. Theoretically this would be the most elegant way to do it. Realistically this will never happen because temperatures never is even close to 40°C in Dec and Jan
[20:48:40] <Kabouik> This would be an issue if I was using a threshold other than 40, but this won't be relevant here

[20:55:24] <confuzeus> you could subset the interest meeting some condition of your choise
[20:56:01] <confuzeus> s/interest/year/
[20:56:54] <Kabouik> Yes but I actually want to apply that calculation on series of >30 years to see when the longest heatwaves occured, so going through manually would be an issue. I can of course use a for loop but I would rot in hell for that
[20:58:02] <Kabouik> Using Bayes's suggestion with `rle(setNames(df$T >= 40, df$Year))`, I can actually get the Year as attr in the rle object, but am still investigating how to extract that and include it as row.names in the table
[20:58:53] <Kabouik> It's not straightforward because when 40°C is not met for several years, rle() returns only one value with a longer series (>365 days)
[21:00:36] <confuzeus> that is why i thought you could implement something custom that meets your needs. it would take into how you intend to further process your data
[21:08:37] <confuzeus> also there is max() that you could use to get longest lengths?
[21:09:08] <Kabouik> Getting the table is actually not bad, as it gives me an idea of how far was the second to longest heatwave
[21:10:19] <Kabouik> I just need to find how to add those damn years in the output table, the issue being that the table is (in that case) 50 rows long, while the rle object contains only 47 values. Probably due to the fact that rle sometime countes multiple series within one year, or none for several years
[21:11:08] <Kabouik> s/sometime countes/sometimes counts
[21:15:42] <confuzeus> the table should not matter. lets say you have all the information you need to identify the hottest temps, you could remove multiple instances of lengths for each year. that would then be your output table
[21:16:11] <confuzeus> if the information is already columns of your data.frame
[21:18:49] <confuzeus> the other option is to provide an MRE showing a sample of the data and the expected output. that way folks here can engage with it more i think

[23:37:16] <rickyrick> Matrix norms?
[23:37:29] <rickyrick> Matrix metric spaces*
[23:37:30] <rickyrick> :^)
[23:39:39] <Bayes> rickyrick thanks, I have many matrixes and I'm trying to cluster them by similarity
[23:40:06] <rickyrick> Yeah so long as you define the right metric to capture your desired similarity, you're good to go :^)
[23:40:15] <Bayes> well that was my issue o_O
[23:40:34] <rickyrick> That is indeed the fundamental issue in most clustering problems
[23:40:41] <rickyrick> Most just wave their hands and use the L2 metric or something
[23:40:53] <Bayes> what's the right metric I want to use to say that matrix A is more similar to matrix B than matrix C
[23:41:15] <Bayes> well yeah, but L2 metric for a matrix? are you thinking a norm(dist(A, B)) kind of thing?
[23:41:16] <rickyrick> Depends on what you mean by similar
[23:41:28] <Bayes> really, I want to talk correlation
[23:41:30] <rickyrick> Yeah the Frobenius norm is just the L2 norm for matrices
[23:41:52] <rickyrick> Well
[23:41:59] <rickyrick> That's kind of hard to define
[23:42:33] <rickyrick> On one hand you can just compute the correlation by treating both matrices as a collection of A_ij values
[23:42:37] <Bayes> As in... cor(A, C) where A = [a1 a2 ... an]^T and a1, ..., an are vectors
[23:44:20] <rickyrick> If you take a step back and consider Var(A) first then the covariance of a matrix valued random variable is a tensor
[23:44:45] <rickyrick> A lot of people just treat such cases as Var(vec(A)) instead
[23:44:58] <rickyrick> At which point you can just do cor(vec(A), vec(C))
[23:45:32] <Bayes> vec as in ... as.vector, ie flattening the matrix as a vector?
[23:45:34] <rickyrick> Yes
[23:45:55] <Bayes> ah gotcha, I forgot to mention something
[23:45:58] <rickyrick> On the other hand, you can compute cor(σ(A), σ(C)) where σ is the vector of singular values
[23:46:03] <rickyrick> Which could also be what you want
[23:46:10] <Bayes> A and B have the number of rows but not the same number of columns (they measure different stuff)
[23:46:54] <rickyrick> Okay so are A and B actually a matrix of observations of a vector-valued random variables?
[23:47:08] <Bayes> imagine A, B, C, ..., M being matrixes with `n` rows but different number of columns
[23:47:28] <rickyrick> But the ith row in each corresponds to the same observational unit?
[23:47:33] <Bayes> yup
[23:48:02] <Bayes> tbf, a1, a2.., an are functionals:D  which I'm loosely treating as vectors until I can learn to do anything better
[23:48:12] <rickyrick> lel
[23:48:47] <Bayes> in a sense, if I were smarter, I'd getting straight to "compute the correlation between functional responses measured on the same observational unit"
[23:48:54] <Bayes> make sense?
[23:49:04] <rickyrick> Yeah it's probably easier to tackle that directly
[23:49:08] <Bayes> so yeah, ith row = ith observational unit
[23:49:12] <rickyrick> Because now you'd be thinking about functional norms
[23:49:48] <Bayes> yep, I wish I was better at FDA
[23:50:29] <Bayes> im sure somebody who works with fda would say "oh that's a fda 101 question" :P
[23:50:44] <rickyrick> I mean
[23:51:01] <rickyrick> It goes back to defining how to quantify the similarity between two functions a_i and b_i
[23:51:08] <rickyrick> i.e. pick your metric
[23:51:37] <Bayes> yup, the functional norm is the right answer
[23:51:41] <rickyrick> And again, what lots of people do is assume a_i and b_i are over the same domain and apply the functional equivalent of the L2 norm
[23:51:41] <rickyrick> :^)
[23:52:25] <Bayes> and from the norm I can move onto the correlation
[23:52:40] <Bayes> similar to what you do with vectors I guess
[23:53:20] <rickyrick> AFAIK 80% of FDA is trying to boil it down to be a finite-sized representation
[23:53:34] <rickyrick> e.g. KL basis expansion
