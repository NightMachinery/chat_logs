[23:15:52] <sunyibo[m]> how would I invest money in foss friendly businesses? I guess the f in foss messes up the capitalistic prospect, but anyhow...
[23:17:05] <artectrex[m]> it's free as in beer though :P
[23:17:18] <artectrex[m]> * it's not free as
[23:18:25] <sunyibo[m]> I'd like to invest in companies that have understood that there is free and better software. And producers of hardware that support foss. And then something like red hat share and sell.
[23:19:22] <sunyibo[m]> Although I don't particularly like red hat, proxmox, ubuntu, and stuff.
[23:19:41] <afontain[m]> there are companies making hardware and investing in software, like Purism and System76
[23:20:08] <sunyibo[m]> yeah, I don't know how much I would bet on them
[23:20:23] <afontain[m]> they are a bit different from those who sell linux computers in that they actually do development
[23:20:24] <sunyibo[m]> I'm more thinking like Lenovo. Good stuff, runs Linux.
[23:21:04] <afontain[m]> there is also the Fairphone, which is actually supporting some mainlining of their devices
[23:21:18] <artectrex[m]> so you want to buy IBM and lenovo shares :P
[23:21:20] <sunyibo[m]> Definitely supporting FAirphone
[23:21:29] <artectrex[m]> artectrex[m]: interesting xD
[23:21:48] <afontain[m]> afontain[m]: but definitely to a much lower scale than what Purism is doing
[23:22:11] <sunyibo[m]> as the name implies...
[23:22:21] <artectrex[m]> Sinon /e/ or something?
[23:22:46] <sunyibo[m]> How much percent of your savings would you bet on Purism?
[23:23:14] <afontain[m]> well, for now they didn't run out of money
[23:23:44] <sunyibo[m]> I'm a bit freaked but Librem. I wouldn't invest in that
[23:23:55] <afontain[m]> I can definitely understand
[23:24:23] <afontain[m]> they did run a profitable busyness selling computers, but they definitely have trouble with their phones
[23:24:43] <afontain[m]> system76 seems fine I guess
[23:24:53] <afontain[m]> I don't know about "why! computing"
[23:24:56] <sunyibo[m]> I would love a working phone...
[23:25:16] <NilsDmitriAlainA> There also is Pine64
[23:25:27] <afontain[m]> but "why! computing" is local :)
[23:25:50] <NilsDmitriAlainA> They made the pine phone, and have a lot of other projects
[23:26:08] <NilsDmitriAlainA> I believe that it is gods hardware
[23:26:13] <NilsDmitriAlainA> Foss*
[23:26:17] <sunyibo[m]> I've never seen a physical pine phone 
[23:26:32] <NilsDmitriAlainA> Me neither, but I would love to
[23:26:44] <afontain[m]> Pine64 is cool in that they provide hardware to work on, and they have pretty good prices
[23:27:00] <sunyibo[m]> It's just a general impression: Hey industry, why are you spending gazillions on stuff that doesn't work.
[23:27:02] <afontain[m]> they don't really give a lot of money to each projet in comparison though
[23:27:37] <afontain[m]> still pretty cool of them to provide hardware :)
[23:27:52] <afontain[m]> I have two pinephones if you're interested
[23:27:59] <artectrex[m]> I have a pinephone as well
[23:28:04] <artectrex[m]> collecting dust
[23:28:11] <afontain[m]> one braveheart and one postmarketOS edition
[23:28:14] <artectrex[m]> I should try updating it to see if things have gotten better
[23:28:34] <NilsDmitriAlainA> afontain[m]: Well Iâ€™d love to see one irl
[23:28:52] <sunyibo[m]> I cannot say no to hardware
[23:29:24] <afontain[m]> "hardware is hard" â€” Purism, 2017â€“2021
[23:29:27] <afontain[m]> :D
[23:29:30] <afontain[m]>  * :P
[23:30:02] <sunyibo[m]> I hate to advertise it, but Netflix is pretty cool for foreign languages...
[23:30:09] <NilsDmitriAlainA> Yeah purism really messed up with the librem 5
[23:30:34] <artectrex[m]> sunyibo[m]: Better than torrents? I doubt it
[23:30:43] <afontain[m]> They possibly did quite some mistakes in retrospect
[23:30:54] <artectrex[m]> artectrex[m]: Sonarr+radarr+jellyfin UX cannot be beat imo
[23:30:58] <afontain[m]> but at least now we have phosh
[23:31:09] <NilsDmitriAlainA> Yeah thatâ€™s true
[23:31:31] <NilsDmitriAlainA> Did purism make libhandy ?
[23:31:40] <afontain[m]> yup
[23:32:07] <artectrex[m]> Can't wait for threading support in Matrix
[23:32:08] <NilsDmitriAlainA> So thankfully, they didnâ€™t only make mistakes
[23:32:09] <sunyibo[m]> I don't do torrents, so I can't tell. Wink, wink. But even then I guess the linguistic abundance is unbeatable.
[23:32:37] <afontain[m]> libhandy is honestly quite neat
[23:32:43] <artectrex[m]> Yeah it's pretty good
[23:32:59] <artectrex[m]> most of it should be merged into Gtk proper imo
[23:33:20] <artectrex[m]> some of it got put into gtk 4 I think?
[23:33:22] <afontain[m]> Well, for GTK4 it is now libadwaita, so, huh
[23:33:39] <NilsDmitriAlainA> Rip theming
[23:34:14] <artectrex[m]> Does anyone want some money for working on a client for peertube by the way, I got funding but don't have time
[23:34:22] <afontain[m]> tbh I think GNOME is taking some odd decisions those day
[23:34:31] <NilsDmitriAlainA> Yeah same
[23:35:01] <NilsDmitriAlainA> Ubuntu too, but I really like gtk apps though
[23:35:16] <afontain[m]> artectrex[m]: I think I could spend like 1 day a week or something
[23:35:21] <NilsDmitriAlainA> Switching to kde will be pretty hard ðŸ˜…
[23:35:25] <artectrex[m]> afontain[m]: then why didn't you lol
[23:35:35] <afontain[m]> because first weeks hard
[23:35:48] <artectrex[m]> Anyone can have the project really, I barely have time to work on my other project
[23:35:50] <afontain[m]> or unknown idk
[23:36:02] <afontain[m]> * or first weeks unknown idk
[23:39:35] <afontain[m]> I wonder what would have happened if Purism went with Plasma Mobile
[23:43:15] <afontain[m]> s/I wonder what would have happened if Purism went with Plasma Mobile/I wonder what would have happened if Purism had gon with Plasma Mobile/
[23:43:18] <afontain[m]> s/I wonder what would have happened if Purism went with Plasma Mobile/I wonder what would have happened if Purism had gone with Plasma Mobile/
