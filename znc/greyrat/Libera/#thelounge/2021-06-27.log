[17:25:37] <bookworm> just pull in their CDN
[17:25:45] <bookworm> cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hack-font@3.3.0/build/web/hack.css
[17:26:37] <bookworm> or in other words, scroll (and read) to the bottom of the page you just linked ;)

[17:32:17] <bookworm> in human understandable terms, they already host the font for you, you just need to use the url

[21:55:13] <eliocamp> Ok, I'm coming back with my issue about css things not applying if I add them on a theme. I've checked and the same exact css works well if I add it as a custom stylesheet, but it doesn't load the image I put in content if added to a theme. 
[21:55:32] <eliocamp> Here's the css snippet working: It hides a channel name and adds a logo: https://i.imgur.com/4REQ5H2.png
[21:55:46] <eliocamp> (the logo is too big, but that's another issue)
[21:56:54] <eliocamp> And here's the result of putting that css snippet inside a custom theme:  https://i.imgur.com/mWaJA5y.png

[22:47:52] <bookworm> eliocamp: chrome devtools grey out css properties if they are overwritten somewhen later
[22:48:47] <eliocamp> So they are not being replaced :S (which is reasonable, because the only thing that's failing is the logo; the text is not displayed)
[22:50:56] <eliocamp> Ah! I found the issue! (I think). Hovering over the url, chrome tells me that url(img/logo_datahouse.svg) is actually pointing to /themes/img/logo_datahouse.svg
[22:56:00] <eliocamp> OK. moving the logo to  /usr/lib/node_modules/thelounge/themes/img actually worked! 
[22:57:48] <aab_> can we see the finished image

[23:27:13] <aab_> thats where many css from my own NPM theme is referenced so should be exactly the same for an image
