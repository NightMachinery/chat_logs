[00:00:53] <Sammitch> the people behind it are absolute pillocks
[00:01:32] <Sammitch> they can write code, but they cannot design a system to save their lives
[00:02:08] <Sammitch> my last job included maintaining a standalone install, and I have worked with another guy who had to make the standalone version HA
[00:02:47] <Sammitch> it's... bad. hopoefully it's less so now, but a few years ago it was laughable.
[00:03:20] <Sammitch> not to mention their hardware plans for moving gitlab.com out of the cloud and onto self-managed metal that basically got laughed at so hard they scrapped it
[00:07:01] <Sammitch> I found a couple of them at a booth at a convention in 2017 and I was going to be mean to them in person, but it was just like... a table with a printed gitlab banner, and two dudes in tshirts surrounded by huge custom booths with actual staff
[00:07:44] <judah> I like the hosted version. Do not care at all for the self-hosted version. There is also the small detail that they keep making free features paid but thats besides the point
[00:08:13] <judah> Definitely not great but I agree, miles better than BitBucket. Much prefer it over GitHub as well, but for entirely different reasons
[00:08:36] <Sammitch> they are the #2 git service purely by virtue of there being 3 major players, and one of the two eating paint chips and surviving entirely through JIRA integration requirements.
[00:08:58] <Sammitch> *one of the three
[00:10:45] <Albright> I'd like to try Phabricator some day
[00:12:32] <judah> I played with this for a bit, lots of fun and does the job https://gitea.io/en-us/
[00:19:17] <Sammitch> I appreciates that gitea is still unabashedly simple
[00:19:53] <Sammitch> I wish I would have picked that instead of gitlab
[00:20:35] <Albright> I have a reflexive distrust of things associated with Google, and that includes projects written in Go by association
[00:22:32] <Albright> I know that's somewhat irrational, but I'm not sure why anyone would use Go anyway when there are so many other alternatives out there that aren't associated with Google.
[00:22:33] <Sammitch> go is a weird little language, but it is _just_ a language :P
[00:22:53] <Sammitch> afaik google doesn't _own_ it, it just originated there
[00:23:09] <Albright> Yeah, I know.
[00:23:10] <judah> I am also against AJAX for the same reason Albright, cant trust it
[00:23:28] <Albright> And yes, the PHP developer is judging others' taste in programming languages, ha ha ha
[00:23:40] <Sammitch> ehehe
[00:24:04] <Sammitch> Headline: Pot Comments on Blackness of Kettle
[00:24:18] <Albright> judah: Are you saying AJAX is associated with Google?
[00:24:56] <judah> Albright, Google "invented" AJAX for their maps product. They needed to be able to load map images and overlays in the background without overloading the client. Google did, perhaps indirectly, make AJAX
[00:25:00] <Sammitch> avoiding abstract concepts because of their association witha company? that's next-level
[00:25:01] <judah> At least the concept of it
[00:25:40] <judah> It was meant to be a friendly jest, poking fun at you for not liking a language. I was joking that I didnt like an abstract development concept for the same reason
[00:25:57] <Albright> judah: Hmm. I don't think that's quite correct. If anything XMLHttpRequest was a creation of Microsoft.

[01:58:35] <gamara> sorry they are in the context of an if statement
[01:58:35] <gamara> so the null is being converted to falsy

[01:59:25] <stenno> `data['t']['r'] ?? NULL` seems nonsensical though

[01:59:34] <stenno> yep
[01:59:35] <gamara> I think it is a redundent check in an if statement
[01:59:52] <__adrian> at least, not here. if you were assigning to a variable or something it might
[02:00:00] <stenno> __adrian: huh?
[02:00:20] <stenno> in which case does `$foo ?? null` make sense?
[02:00:34] <stenno> or `expr ?? null` rather
[02:00:53] <gamara> I was testing it in a php compiler and it seems in the context of an if parameter its redundent
[02:01:06] <stenno> i would like to know where it isn't redundant
[02:01:17] <stenno> i dont understand the 'assigning to a variable' part
[02:01:18] <gamara> if you were assigning a value
[02:01:25] <stenno> yes?
[02:01:41] <stenno> if i was to assign a value then what
[02:01:50] <gamara> The null collesence operator assigns the value after it if the value before it is null
[02:02:00] <stenno> correct
[02:02:25] <gamara> so for instance if $data = null, and you had $test = $data ?? true; then $test = true
[02:04:45] <stenno> the value after it is null though
[02:04:45] <stenno> so
[02:04:45] <stenno> how does that make sense
[02:04:46] <stenno> that is my question lol
[02:04:46] <stenno> so this reads: 'if the expression evaluates to null, don't assign it, but assign null instead'

[02:06:46] <gamara> you might be better off asking in symfony freeman_h1
[02:06:57] <stenno> so the evaluation of the expression is fine, but the assignment is not?
[02:07:03] <__adrian> because ?? is like isset(): it doesn't error if the operand doesn't exist.
[02:07:06] <stenno> yes
[02:07:11] <stenno> that is what i thought
[02:07:13] <stenno> it is some magic
[02:07:25] <stenno> wouldn't you say that doesn't make sense
[02:07:35] <__adrian> well, it's a very well-defined intent and implementation
[02:07:55] <stenno> its not intuitive
[02:08:12] <__adrian> no, i wouldn't say that. the reason for adding ?? is so people didn't have to do  $x = isset($y) ? $y : $something
[02:08:39] <__adrian> i can see some people not being familiar with the concept
[02:08:46] <stenno> i thought it was so that people don't have to do is_null($y) ? $bla : $y
[02:08:53] <__adrian> nope
[02:08:59] <stenno> jesus christ
[02:09:25] <__adrian> that whole isset() pattern is fairly common. and many other languages have a null coalesce operator.
[02:09:39] <stenno> yes, javascript for example
[02:09:44] <__adrian> i'm really not sure why you're so upset over it, but... ok, you don't have to use it
[02:10:13] <stenno> in javascript, you evaluate expressions, and they throw or don't throw
[02:10:40] <stenno> in javascript, if you had: const foo = throwing_expr ?? something_else; it would throw because it would evaluate throwing_expr
[02:10:47] <__adrian> freeman_h1: that does indeed sound like a symfony question, if it's more complicated than "pass $entity as an arg"

[02:17:16] <__adrian> "stenno> as we just found out, assigning a variable to something undefined will throw"  // ah, no; that's not exactly what's happening.
[02:17:42] <__adrian> ?? is like using isset() on the lhs.
[02:17:43] <stenno> biberu: if you had: const foo = throwing_expr ?? 'bla'; , js would throw
[02:18:02] <biberu> sure
[02:18:03] <TML> I suppose you might be able to do it with extract() or some similar magic, but I'm hard-pressed to come up with one on-the-fly
[02:18:05] <__adrian> without it, you _are_ trying to access a value that doesn't exist, and without the benefit of checking via isset().
[02:18:34] <__adrian> and i do understand your js example, but realize that it's not relevant to this issue at all.
[02:19:28] <stenno> using isset and ?? is basically like wrapping try-catch around it
[02:19:36] <stenno> is that correct?
[02:19:49] <stenno> for _any_ error thrown by throwing_expr?
[02:19:52] <stenno> (in php)
[02:20:59] <gamara> I think they both do the same thing
[02:21:06] <stenno> why not just use @
[02:21:32] <__adrian> no
[02:21:40] <stenno> $foo = @$bar[$lol];
[02:21:46] <biberu> that's not that it does
[02:21:56] <__adrian> $a ?? $b  is the same as   isset($a) ? $a : $b
[02:21:56] <gamara> if(isset($data['sdfsd') and if($['sdfdsf'] ?? null) would basically give you the same result
[02:21:57] <stenno> ok

[02:23:00] <stenno> isset is still magic
[02:23:10] <__adrian> it's a lookup
[02:23:18] <TML> yes, but it's intentional magic
[02:23:27] <stenno> i wouldn't call isset magic if the signature was isset(array, key)
[02:23:35] <stenno> oslt
[02:23:36] <TML> Why?
[02:23:53] <biberu> isset(scope, name)
[02:24:03] <__adrian> this isn't scope
[02:24:08] <TML> and if that was the signature of isset(), how are you going to check the current scope
[02:24:18] <biberu> conceptual example
[02:24:31] <stenno> well, shouldn't i always know if a _variable_ has been properly declared?
[02:24:33] <__adrian> for awareness, isset() takes multiple args
[02:24:53] <__adrian> stenno: arguably. but you don't always. as above, with inputs
[02:24:57] <stenno> do you use isset to check if actual _variables_ are set? that seems like a bad idea
[02:25:05] <__adrian> also note isset() is not _only_ "exists?"
[02:25:23] <__adrian> it's "exists and not null?"
[02:25:51] <Blondie101010> that's the only point I disagree with it
[02:25:53] <__adrian> this might have been driven by implememtation details, but is nice imo
[02:26:26] <stenno> i see now how ?? is syntax sugar for isset($foo) ? $foo : $bar
[02:26:58] <TML> stenno: So how do *you* check to see if actual _variables_ are set?

[02:32:48] <stenno> its like `with` in js
[02:32:59] <Blondie101010> but either way, variable or array element, no difference
[02:33:04] <stenno> it is a difference
[02:33:08] <Blondie101010> nope
[02:33:12] <stenno> what is the situation then
[02:33:16] <TML> stenno: so you think that any instance of a function with optional parameters is "code smell"?
[02:33:17] <__adrian> i'm not arguing you shouldn't know what's defined and what's not. i know. but i use ?? quite often, and even ?? null
[02:33:21] <Blondie101010> you're refering to something that either exists or not
[02:33:23] <stenno> TML: no.
[02:33:34] <stenno> TML: i am arguing that i would know if $foo _exists_ or not
[02:33:39] <stenno> not if it is null or not
[02:34:01] <TML> stenno: You're writing f() - you have no idea whether people are going to call you with 1 or 2 arguments. How do you do that without isset/??
[02:34:20] <stenno> TML: like you did. with assigning null as default value, for example
[02:34:26] <TML> stenno: I did it by using ??
[02:34:33] <stenno> unction f($x, $y=null)
[02:34:36] <__adrian> they mean the arg
[02:34:56] <__adrian> but note, that ^ is how i often use ?? anyway
[02:34:57] <stenno> i know that assigning $y to anything will not throw because its not defined
[02:35:05] <Blondie101010> you can't distinguish in php whether it's null or unset
[02:35:22] <stenno> in which situation would a _variable_ be unset
[02:35:27] <Blondie101010> hmmm actually you could but not directly
[02:35:45] <Blondie101010> unset($stenno) // done
[02:35:52] <BadAdviceCat> stenno, I partially agree with what you are saying. I draw the line in the sand for when the data is coming from outside sources. To put things in perspective: Anyone can send any $_POST variable to your server. Or change the JSON structure. It's not guaranteed to be in the shape as your application expects it to be. So it is necessary for me to always check via isset.
[02:36:45] <stenno> using isset for array elements is different then using isset for a _variable_ which was apparently _declared_ without proper checking
[02:36:50] <BadAdviceCat> We can just go into HTML inspect. Then remove the POST variables. So now those would be missing after submitting the form. The app would expect it, but it's missing from the http request.
[02:36:50] <TML> stenno: From the perspective of the PHP language, given "$y = null;" - $y is considered an unset variable
[02:37:31] <stenno> TML: but $foo = $y; // would not throw if $y is null, but would throw if $y was unset
[02:37:48] <__adrian> it's null in both cases
[02:37:56] <__adrian> anything undefined is null
[02:38:07] <__adrian> the difference is the error
[02:39:27] <stenno> i am still waiting for a real example where you have a _variable_ where you don't know if it was unset or not
[02:39:37] <stenno> for me that sounds like you didn't properly checked during assignment
[02:40:09] <stenno> regardless of where the data comes from

[02:45:21] <__adrian> stenno: distinction: it's an error, not an exception.

[02:45:26] <TML> stenno: Maybe I just don't know what you mean by "throw" in this case, because "<?php var_dump($thisvariabledoesnotexist);" doesn't _throw_, either.

[02:51:10] <biberu> difference though, trying to read from an undeclared variable seems like a logical error

[02:52:14] <stenno> BadAdviceCat: ah yeah, you are checking for existance during declaration, like i suggested

[02:52:49] <__adrian> biberu: you should know. but php doesn't require advance declaration of variables. this is a design choice, not a flaw. so being able to check is necessary.

[02:56:28] <stenno> how can you declare a variable in php without initializing?
[02:57:01] <TML> lambdas
[02:57:22] <TML> function arguments
[02:57:27] <TML> class properties
[02:57:50] <stenno> for me, class properties are not variables, they are properties of variables
[02:57:50] <TML> those are just off the top of my head, I'm certain there are probably even more tricksy ways
[02:57:56] <BadAdviceCat> stenno, I can only think of for template libraries, when the https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.extract.php is being used. Where the User of the library can toggle an option to catch errors for when the template files itself attempt to use non-existing variables, or make it so that templates can happily use variables that doesn't exist in such a way that that app won't blow up in the developer's face like a Bad science/chemistry experiment.
[02:58:16] <TML> stenno: Classes are variables?
[02:58:27] <TML> I can't follow your logic there
[02:58:29] <stenno> class as an instance, yes
[02:58:39] <TML> I'm not talking about instances. Those are different.
[02:58:40] <stenno> or what do you mean with class properties
[02:58:54] <TML> I'm talking about the class itself, before any instance of it exists.
[02:59:02] <stenno> like $foo = Bar.zomg; ?
[02:59:15] <stenno> zomg would be a variable in your understanding? i'd call it a property
[02:59:21] <stenno> but maybe php lingo is different
[02:59:39] <TML> like class foo { public $bar; }
[02:59:45] <stenno> right
[02:59:54] <TML> foo is not a variable
[02:59:56] <TML> it's a class
[02:59:58] <stenno> nope
[03:00:00] <TML> $bar is a variable
[03:00:21] <stenno> isn't it a class property
[03:00:31] <TML> Yes, class properties in PHP are variables.
[03:00:40] <TML> > A class may contain its own constants, variables (called "properties"), and functions (called "methods").
[03:00:40] <stenno> oof
[03:00:41] <BadAdviceCat> Ah, good example.
[03:00:58] <stenno> well thats semantics then though
[03:01:13] <TML> Were we ever discussing anything OTHER than semantics?
[03:01:17] <stenno> i feel like i could have presented my claim better if i knew what things are called
[03:01:45] <stenno> if i have a variable $foo, i might not know if it is NULL or not
[03:01:45] <TML> and I feel like I would have had less discussion with you if you bothered to know what things were called before registering opinions on them ;)
[03:01:52] <stenno> no
[03:02:27] <stenno> if i have a variable $foo, i might not know if it is null or not. i will, however, know if it has anything like null assigned to it
[03:02:33] <stenno> if i don't, i wrote bad code
[03:02:34] <TML> Not sure what you mean "no" - I definitely DO feel that way, regardless of your "no"
[03:02:41] <stenno> sure, sorry
[03:03:10] <stenno> your feelings towards that are valid, i just don't share that feeling
[03:03:26] <TML> stenno: You can only say "I will know if it has anything like null assigned to it" if you are the only person who ever calls your functions
[03:04:01] <stenno> TML: with your own code example from earlier, you did function bla($foo = null)
[03:04:07] <stenno> assigning null as default parameter
[03:04:26] <BadAdviceCat> stenno, well, there are footguns, as long as you know how to avoid them.
[03:04:51] <TML> correct - but that's only the use-case where no one passed a value; you cannot possibly know every possible value a 3rd party may pass into your function
[03:05:08] <TML> if you never have 3rd parties calling your code, sure you can know that

[03:05:59] <stenno> ok then let me summarize this whole thing
[03:06:14] <TML> none of my commentary above is about undeclared variables
[03:06:19] <TML> only about _unset_ variables
[03:06:27] <stenno> i must always know if a variable is unassigned or not. if i don't know, and i have to test afterwards, then its code smell
[03:06:37] <stenno> this was my whole point and issue regarding isset($foo)
[03:07:24] <TML> Again, you're mixing terms
[03:07:49] <stenno> you just told me it was the correct term..
[03:07:56] <stenno> oh no!
[03:07:56] <TML> the only thing we've established in this conversation is taht you must always know whether a given variable is _DECLARED_ or not. You don't know if it's unassigned, you don't know if it's unset.
[03:07:58] <stenno> my bad
[03:08:01] <stenno> i mean undeclared
[03:08:08] <stenno> mixed that up
[03:08:11] <TML> s/taht/that/
[03:08:41] <stenno> yes, my bad. i meant undeclared
[03:08:43] <stenno> what a mess
[03:08:45] <stenno> time to go to bed
[03:08:45] <TML> stenno: I would agree with you that you should always be able to know whether variables are declared or not.
[03:08:51] <stenno> ok, then we agree
[03:09:10] <stenno> it was indeed just about semantics after all like you said
[03:09:14] <TML> and, to my point, if that's what you had said to start, I would have not felt the need to discuss it
[03:09:20] <TML> :)
[03:09:37] <TML> I'm confident that a good 90% of human communication is just about semantics
[03:09:42] <stenno> it is
[03:09:45] <TML> we just don't recognize it most of the time

[09:55:30] <Togra> weird, why is it around at all if it's just a waste? seems like it should just be removed to reduce confusion
[09:56:42] <TinoDidriksen> The case for \ is Windows UNC paths a'la \\?\C:\... - if you aren't working with UNC paths, you don't need \. Also, Windows Registry paths need \, but you almost certainly won't be hitting the registry from PHP.
[09:58:50] <TinoDidriksen> \ was needed before Windows NT - so, on Windows 98 and ME. But the NT kernel supports / in almost all paths. Explorer and the GUI tools took longer to catch up.

[12:30:33] <panella32> I had python in mind at first but for some reason it was more handy for me to write it in php. But your point is on. probably I also have to help them how to run the script.
[12:32:02] <panella32> I've recently started writing and coding stuff and tbh have zero experience with C++. Is it good enough to deal with https requests?
[12:33:39] <panella32> I think I can also run the script on a azure vm and make a basic html/php website.
[12:34:47] <panella32> So there is no need to install php and edit php.ini (pure-pain) for everyone who is going to use the script.
[12:37:38] <TinoDidriksen> If you're running it on a VM, then there's again no need for Windows support.
[12:41:04] <panella32> Yes you right. But I have a cloud pc and its internet speed is almost 10x faster than my host setup. I just had in mind that maybe sometimes specially for big videos it's good idea to run it on that cloud pc.
[12:41:43] <panella32> But maybe I have to use something like Cygwin on windows server.. right?
[12:44:34] <panella32> TinoDidriksen I'm going to abondon windows version right away! if and only if there is a way to run my php script on windows cloud pc (on something like crygwin)
[12:45:39] <panella32> that way I can run the exact same version I'm running on mac, on windows cloud without any change right?
[12:45:42] <TinoDidriksen> You can certainly run Cygwin and WSL on a remote Windows machine, but I question why you even have a Windows VM and not a Linux VM.
[12:48:59] <panella32> The windows vm is actually for other stuff like downloading/uploading/torrenting and doing ordinary windows-related stuff faster and 24/7. I haven't tried linux-vm because everything so far I need I've already been able to do on mac or that windows-vm. This is the first time I see a need that mac/windowsVM mix can't handle well.
[12:50:44] <TinoDidriksen> Downloading/uploading/torrenting can be done via a cheap headless Linux VM. Command line tools exist for it all.

[13:17:55] <hbjy> So I have a function, TypeHelper::getModel(string $typeName); -- it basically lets us dynamically grab models by a name we store in the database for metadata.
[13:17:58] <hbjy>  In that function, if we can't find a custom model that exists, we return an anonymous model instead that lets us rely 100% on this returning us a model.

[13:27:30] <Naktibalda> I think that your code changes value of the field that belongs to ContentModel
[13:27:48] <mishehu> yeah, tableName is static, meaning it's one value for all instances.
[13:28:06] <hbjy> mishehu, Naktibalda, but shouldn't it be creating a new instance of it every time?
[13:28:07] <panella32> TinoDidriksen I thought there's only one WSL :) Okay I'm going to google them. I hope I can install all three and run the code on each to report the differences if there is any. I'm scared of the process maybe another pain awaiting me.
[13:28:13] <hbjy> As in a new anonymous class
[13:28:19] <hbjy> Not as in a new instance of the same class
[13:28:49] <mishehu> hbjy: ok, but explain what you are attempting to do by declaring 'protected static $tableName;'
[13:28:50] <Naktibalda> hbjy: your class extends ContentModel and static field is shared between all instances of ContentModel
[13:29:31] <hbjy> mishehu: That's a workaround because we're using Eloquent -- we need to be able to call static functions on it occasionally, and so we needed to store the tableName in a way that wouldn't get wiped if Eloquent returns a new instance of the model with new data
[13:29:49] <hbjy> Naktibalda: tableName doesn't exist on ContentModel, only on this class

[14:25:07] <FightingFalcon> lol
[14:26:52] <AllenJB> That looks suspiciously like someone has used '$oid' instead of "$oid" (single quotes so variable doesn't get parsed, or something that creates that effect)
[14:28:38] <FightingFalcon> i tried to get the value but couldnt

[14:28:48] <FightingFalcon> didnt work
[14:28:49] <TinoDidriksen> Could be many reasons a $ wound up there. The term "oid" is pretty common for unique object IDs.
[14:28:56] <TinoDidriksen> Use '$oid'

[15:22:22] <TinoDidriksen> panella32, if you want to wait for all background tasks to complete, loop https://www.php.net/pcntl_wait until it returns <= 0

[15:36:33] <TinoDidriksen> On Posix platforms, if you want to background a process entirely then both stdout and stderr should be disconnected from the parent.

[20:16:34] <varrg> Structural question: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9N54MQhK I need to call read() with a callable, or otherwise it should determine the callback from a lookup table on the mime type. Code is pseudo, I am looking for a concise way to A) keep the lookup table (in an abstract class in this example) B) type hint
[20:17:07] <varrg> thoughts? Would be nice to accept a classname in read() as well. But I can't typehint strings to a class implementing an interface.
[20:17:33] *** Joins: Nekomander (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat)

[20:18:52] <__adrian> i'd recommend an interface over just any callable
[20:19:14] <__adrian> but the idea of "use this one if provided; else lookup" is fine
[20:20:57] <varrg> okay. And the only sane way to check if the passed classname implements an interface is with is_a or class_implements at runtime?
[20:22:23] <varrg> otherwise require a callback: read('myfile.txt', MyXMLParser::parse(...)) & write('myfile.txt', $mydata, MyXMLParser::render(...)) or ...(..., ..., fn($data) => parse_stuff($data))
[20:22:38] <panella32> TinoDidriksen Now works fine. But it prints whole log each time (as you can see here https://i.imgur.com/JwVCPlu.png). Is it possible to print the log only once and just replace the numbers?
[20:23:24] <varrg> I will supply with a few parsers which will all be classes. But I would like the user to be able to supply a simple closure or other for his own parser
[20:25:07] <__adrian> varrg: no, typehint it

[20:27:46] <varrg> well, in the constructor I accept filenames but not parser, so it will call read($filename), but if it can't determine parser it will fail so the user should do: new Config(Config::read('myfile', $myparser))
[20:28:07] <__adrian> "varrg> also, a parser can parse or render, or both"  // also recommend making these separate
[20:28:12] <varrg> Config accepts arrays as well
[20:28:21] <Jonos> @adrian what was the php method you told me to use the other day for php forms and writing to sql db i had to reinstall windows and lost the link .
[20:28:48] <__adrian> question is why isn't the config an instance?
[20:29:29] <varrg> __adrian, for the automatic parser detection from mimetype, I need a lookup table. So I need the user to be able to register it (register_parser() in the example), having them seperate would make 2 lookup tables. Would be fine, but most parsers do both so it would ease if they could just register it once for both
[20:30:07] <panella32> __adrian can you please help me?
[20:30:12] <__adrian> so is this meant to generate multiple configs from multiple files/parsers/etc.?
[20:30:19] <varrg> the config is an instance, the read method is static because at the moment the constructor doesn't ask for a parser, and if the automatic detection fails, users need to pass Config::read() to the constructor
[20:30:33] <__adrian> gotcha
[20:30:35] <varrg> it is meant to import data from multiple files/arrays
[20:30:48] <__adrian> (_could_ still be a $ConfigBuilder object ;)

[21:00:54] <varrg> SrainUser, something else happened between php5 and php7. It should always be parsed as a character code, it's only when you output it that it may be rendered as a new line
[21:01:21] <SrainUser> but its not and i cannot find the solution
[21:01:45] <varrg> if it wasn't saved to the database as a character code for new line but instead as a literal "backslash n", then it would not be parsed as a newline when you get it

[21:36:15] <nucc1> so, if you really want to store the string literal "\n" in your database, you shoudl be using "\\n" on INSERT.
[21:36:25] <SrainUser> nucc1 thanks will triple check
[21:36:56] <nucc1> your database should contain "\n" in there, and I think that the query will retrieve it as you expect.

[23:55:04] <Howdy_McGee> Hello, I'm trying to use Imagick to rotate an image. The issue I'm running into is that the image does rotate but when I view the image in a browser it's doesn't show the rotation.
[23:55:34] <Howdy_McGee> Presumably, I need to update the image EXIF data but when I ->getImageOrientation() it comes back as undefined.
[23:56:54] <TinoDidriksen> Browsers generally don't look at EXIF orientation at all.
[23:57:29] <TinoDidriksen> You need to actually rotate the data for browsers to render what you want.
[23:57:53] <Howdy_McGee> Hmm, any ideas of why the image would be rotated locally but not showing so when viewing the file in a browser? https://pastebin.com/vfmaq4eA

[23:58:49] <Howdy_McGee> I thought maybe browser caching but it seems to be an issue x-browser.
