[21:27:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @mori#6536tz Hmm... that is clear and concise. But I think it hints too much on the results not the algorithms...
[21:30:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Also, if a "general" (multi-type, multi-dimensional) outlier identifier (or anomaly detector) is made using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, `Math::Outliers` a good place for it?
[21:30:53] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I am browsing the packages under Math right now.

[21:35:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Do any of those seem good? 1)  `Math::Outliers::1DIdentifiers`  2) `Math::Outliers::AnomalyDetectors`

[21:55:29] <guifa_> When in doubt, you can always change later.  The advantage with Raku is that you can provide the same module under two separate names, and with use Foo:auth<bar>, it's okay for two people to have the same name to a module
[21:55:51] <guifa_> Early in the ecosystem it's probably a bit hard to tell what the best organization/naming structure is
[21:59:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @guifa_ Ok. Then I will go with the name most clear _and_ expected to me. (`Stats::OutlierIdentifiers` .)
[22:00:55] <guifa_> I'll actually be doing that fairly soon.  I have a module Intl::UserLanguage which made sense in the context of my international work
[22:01:22] <guifa_> but then as I made Intl::UserTimezone I realized that was starting to stretch it
[22:02:08] <guifa_> so I'm going to move them to a new namespace User:: or UserInfo:: where other similar get-info-about-user's-environment modules would fit in

[22:43:48] <guifa_> am I going crazy or did there used to be a thing about Hash subclasses not having BUILD called on them?

[22:45:12] <lizmat> that's quite possible...
[22:47:19] <guifa_> aaaah there was
[22:47:28] <guifa_> but only when bless isn't called manually
[22:47:55] <guifa_> m: class A is Hash { method BUILD { self.BIND-KEY: "a", 1 }; method TWEAK { self.BIND-KEY: "b", 2 }; }; say A.new

[22:49:05] <lizmat> well, yeah, you could argue that there's a problem in core that .bless is not called for subclasses of Hash
[22:49:23] <lizmat> like it is e.g. done with Date / DateTime
[22:51:51] <guifa_> It's by design per https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2716 
[22:52:08] <guifa_> It's easy enough to just add a .new or even directly call a .bless
[22:56:06] <guifa_> although tbh I had never thought of just directly call Foo.bless

[23:30:09] <MasterDuke> guifa_: re your benchmark from earlier. you need to be carefull about running different things in the same script. there's a decent chance that spesh might optimize the first thing it sees, and depending on how similar the subsequent things are, you could run into a situation where the first thing is artificially faster, regardless of which one it
