[01:58:46] <Hunterkll> i mean, the price of actually paying for it isn't bad

[01:59:41] <Hunterkll> fuck if i know

[02:01:33] <Hunterkll> HCI is the 60-day trial one
[02:02:14] <Hunterkll> hub's the 'azure in a box' one, HCI is the more traditional hyper-v like stack with a bunch of azure hooks/integrations

[02:02:34] <Emet-Selch> ah alright, thanks for explaining it Hunterkll
[02:02:46] <Hunterkll> in the 'real' configuration hub requires a minimum of 4 servers, HCI 2
[02:02:47] <Hunterkll> etc
[02:02:51] <DrGibby> aaaaaand fuck this I'm going home

[10:50:04] <SirSceptalot> I have really no idea who saint disco is though
[10:50:33] <SirSceptalot> did disco stu die and get sactified?
[10:50:42] <euphoricallysane> She hung out with klingons and killed em, and now we are here. I wish
[10:51:17] <SirSceptalot> oh, st disco = star trek discovery?
[10:51:21] <euphoricallysane> yeh
[10:52:20] <SirSceptalot> the star trek show with the human that has been raised by vulcans and is introduced as a human with total control over her emotions, before going on to be literally the most emotional character ever in the history of film?
[10:52:32] <euphoricallysane> Riiight
[10:52:49] <SirSceptalot> A woman who proceeds to base 100% of her decision on her emotions and gut feelings?
[10:52:56] <euphoricallysane> Hence, the fun to be made
[10:52:58] <SirSceptalot> who doesn't follow chain of command one single time?
[10:52:58] <DoTheNeedful> s/does/dose
[10:52:59] <layer8> SirSceptalot meant: "who dosen't follow chain of command one single time?"
[10:53:23] <SirSceptalot> yeah there were a few "issues" with that show
[10:53:38] <SirSceptalot> for instance: the plot
[10:53:54] <euphoricallysane> Hence, the fun to be made
[10:53:57] <euphoricallysane> while drinking
[10:54:03] <SirSceptalot> but it's not like the other star trek shows weren't like that honestly
[10:54:15] <SirSceptalot> take TOS for instance
[10:54:24] <euphoricallysane> TOS had how many eps a season?
[10:54:55] <euphoricallysane> TNG, compare
[10:54:59] <euphoricallysane> scale for time
[10:55:14] <SirSceptalot> I remember this show where an outpost needed additional shipments of salt, because some weird last-of-the-species alien was living there disguised as a human
[10:55:25] <euphoricallysane> I'm channeling John Chrichton
[10:55:54] <SirSceptalot> all the damn thing wanted was a salt shaker, to survive
[10:56:06] <SirSceptalot> but instead, they shot it and then said "too bad, that was a really unique lifeform"
[10:56:21] <euphoricallysane> Weak sauce, obv
[10:57:04] <SirSceptalot> yeah I'd pick having a tastier meal over saving a unique alien species any day of the week
[10:57:31] <euphoricallysane> Saving a species is difficult
[10:57:41] <euphoricallysane> A steak does what you want
[10:59:09] <SirSceptalot> anyway, I actually enjoyed discovery, the annoying protagonist notwithstanding
[10:59:20] <euphoricallysane> I really dug s1
[10:59:32] <euphoricallysane> I have been annoyed ever since
[11:00:03] <euphoricallysane> I watch it for my partner.
[11:02:02] <SirSceptalot> I know this is obvious, but with star trek, you just can't start paying attention to how unrealistic stuff is
[11:02:37] <SirSceptalot> and I don't mean the obvious stuff
[11:02:55] <euphoricallysane> It is about the 70% bonding/face camera time, lack of plot, lack of anything
[11:03:09] <euphoricallysane> Picard was better than this, the show
[11:03:41] <SirSceptalot> haven't seen that yet
[11:03:46] <euphoricallysane> It is shit
[11:03:55] <euphoricallysane> don't show it to your partner
[11:04:20] <SirSceptalot> I mostly don't watch sci-fi with her, she's not into it
[11:04:38] <euphoricallysane> I guess, in that, I am lucky... for both
[11:05:18] <euphoricallysane> Appologies, I forgot where I was
[11:05:25] <SirSceptalot> there are a few things she can stand.. She enjoyed.. eum.. the movie with the big robots fighting weird aliens
[11:05:36] <SirSceptalot> lol, do you get that a lot?
[11:05:46] <SirSceptalot> pacific rim, that's the one
[11:05:55] <SirSceptalot> even though that movie was worse for realism
[11:06:04] <SirSceptalot> worse than star trek
[11:06:08] <euphoricallysane> Multiple partners, or a sudden loss of memory upon subjects of passion?
[11:06:35] <SirSceptalot> I meant forgetting where you were
[11:06:58] <euphoricallysane> Oh, I was speaking with regard to the given channel that I am in
[11:07:07] <euphoricallysane> I was rude
[11:07:11] <euphoricallysane> I appologise
[11:07:31] <euphoricallysane> Kinda wasted, and, no
[11:07:40] <SirSceptalot> you were rude?

[12:44:08] <teh_f4ll3n> I'm old...
[12:44:12] <CableNinja> lancehead, looks good to me
[12:44:23] <lancehead> That is the longest one to be fair 
[12:44:37] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> thats what your mom said
[12:44:37] <CableNinja> you could do 1 tee for each
[12:44:50] <CableNinja> for each line I mean
[12:45:06] <lancehead> That's exactly what I came here to avoid though xD 
[12:45:13] <CableNinja> ah lol
[12:45:23] <CableNinja> well then you're about as oneline as you're gonna get then

[12:45:55] <lancehead> lol 
[12:45:57] <CableNinja> lancehead, you dont wanna see the oneliners I write :D
[12:46:14] <CableNinja> the CTO and I are tied for 'worst one liner in company history'
[12:46:14] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> ive written some disgusting shit
[12:46:47] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> i need my onenote off my old laptop i had one truly deplorable 1 liner in there
[12:46:59] <lancehead> I'm about to... I have an echo that goes "blacklist <protocol> 36 times

[12:47:20] <lancehead> s/"blacklist <protocol>/"blacklist <protocol>"
[12:47:20] <layer8> lancehead meant: "I'm about to... I have an echo that goes "blacklist <protocol>" 36 times "
[12:47:35] <CableNinja> I used to have a text file of various oneliner commands for quick use... they were enasty af
[12:47:45] <lancehead> heh
[12:48:02] <lancehead> I also have no fucking idea on how to format code so that's gonna be fun 
[12:48:16] <CableNinja> bash dont give a fuck, new lines and ; do well enough
[12:48:29] <CableNinja> python wants tabs
[12:48:36] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> the feds broke down my door and killed my dog for how offensive and disgusting one of my commands i had saved in onenote was
[12:48:36] <CableNinja> or spaces
[12:48:37] <lancehead> nah I mean things like tabbing for readability in this case 
[12:48:45] <CableNinja> lancehead, oh, just think logically
[12:48:55] <CableNinja> if its data stepped into an if block, tab it in
[12:49:25] <lancehead> With these echo strings I'm currently tabbing the | sudo tee -a until they line up on the right side
[12:49:42] <lancehead> no clue if that's how you do it 
[12:49:57] <CableNinja> normally shouldnt, but it wont have any effect either way
[12:50:25] <CableNinja> you could strip out 90% of the spaces\tabs in bash and bash wouldnt care as long as things had proper semicolons where they needed to be
[12:51:16] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> no spaces

[12:56:35] <lancehead> How's this then 
[12:57:09] <CableNinja> looks good. only other thing I mentioned was spacing after the # for each comment, but thats minor nitpick
[12:57:27] <lancehead> Oh you did mean the comments in my bash script \
[12:57:32] <CableNinja> yeah
[12:57:35] <CableNinja> but those too
[12:57:36] <CableNinja> lol
[12:57:44] <lancehead> ah, both
[12:59:00] <lancehead> watch me send this to one of our software engineers and have him ask "why are there spaces in your comments"
[12:59:16] <CableNinja> given all the sudo's I would likely remove all of the sudos, and put something like this at the top: `if [ $EUID -ne 0 ]; then echo "This must be run as root"; exit 1; fi`
[12:59:34] <CableNinja> then you just sudo <your script>
[13:00:02] <CableNinja> thats not required, it achieves the same thing, just with less sudoing

[13:08:37] <SirSceptalot> like I would ever remember that
[13:10:28] <CableNinja> I did one of those years and years and years ago.

[17:05:12] <lancehead> but they're 3 feet long... 
[17:05:28] <lancehead> wait no that's not right

[17:05:45] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> These fucking idiots thinking a digital signal needs to have a $1300 cable less than 10 feet long
[17:05:51] <lancehead> 10 feet
[17:05:55] <lancehead> is how long they are 
[17:06:38] <lancehead> they have two 3.5mm connectors going into the headphones. normally both sides use ground/tip/ring, philips decided to go L - ground/tip, R- ground/ring
[17:06:56] <lancehead> had to get a eur 90 custom cable just to get something shorter than fucking ten feet...

[19:31:57] <DrGibby> oh god that looks like shit in discord lol
[19:31:58] <lancehead> uhh
[19:32:13] <Hunterkll> lancehead: think of it like writing software to add kernel functionality
[19:32:14] <Hunterkll> i guess
[19:32:16] <Hunterkll> in a fancy language
[19:32:21] <teh_f4ll3n> is it like IGRP vs EIGRP?
[19:32:25] <Hunterkll> no
[19:32:26] <signofzeta> The e means extended.  It's like BPF 2.0, basically.
[19:32:27] <mistiry> enhanced or something i'd guess. i have not used BPF before tho

[19:32:29] <DrGibby> E I G R P
[19:32:32] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: it's a JIT runtime inside the kernel

[19:33:15] <Hunterkll> lancehead: the point is to do it in such a way (like macOS's new system extensions vs old kernel extensions) to provide a way to do such things without writing direct kernel modules

[19:34:18] <lancehead> gotcha Hunterkll. I'll probably turn it off, there's no reason for this system to have it enabled

[19:40:27] <Hunterkll> but yea do make sure instant change notification is turned on at the AD level
[19:40:36] <Hunterkll> but by default, replication time is every 10 minutes

[19:40:57] <Hunterkll> of course, in this case, i'd be making sure repadmin / dcdiag is flying through cleanly 
[19:41:04] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: really you shold just delete the old DCs and rebuild
[19:41:08] <mrghostman> should have just demoted the DCs first

[21:55:05] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> maybe i can show an example
[21:55:06] <monr0e> Its been a while since I looked at PS
[21:56:13] <int0x1C8> like if I want to use the managed EWS API I have to do [Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.Data]::ExchangeService(Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.Data.ExchangeVersion.Exchange_2016)

[21:59:41] <int0x1C8> that puts everything in current scope so I can just do 'svc = ExchangeService(ExchangeVersion.Exchange_2016)'
[22:00:19] <int0x1C8> iunno maybe there's some fancy powershell voodoo for making that cleaner, but I don't know it
[22:00:22] <monr0e> What are you trying to do with powershell int0x1C8?
[22:01:22] <int0x1C8> I'm just explaining that powershell is cool at first for messing with DLLs, but gets really verbose
[22:01:47] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> he's just saying that calling the namespaces is tedious/ugly in ps since they cant really be aliased
[22:01:56] <int0x1C8> yes that's it
[22:02:14] <monr0e> Oh. Yeah, if you're fucking aroudn with any sort of library I'd probably suggest you build a little console app for it. Or if its something you need to do over again,maybe a little winforms app that you can add to over time
[22:03:05] <int0x1C8> its my one use case for ironpython, and it does pretty well for that
