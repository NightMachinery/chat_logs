[00:23:41] <Kerr> then how would I go about doing this?
[00:24:02] <Kerr> will I be able to do it from a live cd (flash drive)
[00:24:05] <ananke> no such thing as 'growing it from the bottom', as the filesystem would have to be moved, then it can 'grow from the top'
[00:24:21] <qman__> You can only grow partitions from the end, not the beginning
[00:24:21] <ananke> Kerr: yes, gnu parted, they have live iso
[00:24:45] <Kerr> hmm.. "well crap" is the answer then?

[01:32:43] <hodapp> similar but a bit more extensive than ECC
[01:32:49] <ayecee> kind of, except ecc both detects and corrects errors.
[01:32:59] <ayecee> crc would only be used to detect errors.

[03:47:47] <Kerr> I'm thinking of setting up my desktop with ssh so I can get to/work on stuff when I'm away. (The machine is normally on 24/7) But am concerned about inviting attacks by doing this. Do you have any advice on how to set up openssh more securely?
[03:47:50] <Dagmar> Spunk: It leaks memory and crashes on the four common platforms we've been testing it with
[03:48:14] <Spunk> works fine in arch
[03:48:15] <Aura_Mancer> My laptop has not had any issues with crackiling. But my dekstop has them. And they popped up again after a reinstall.

[04:50:48] <goddard> firefoxs new tab sleeping thing is super annoying
[04:50:56] <gry> you have two monitors, they are two outputs, their resolution is normal. i'm not clearly understanding what you are trying to configure
[04:51:41] <akk> gry: X can map those two physical displays into a large virtual screen that has them side by side, or one above the other, or whatever.
[04:51:55] <uwharrie> it's traditionally called the viewport
[04:51:56] <gry> akk why would you wish to do that?
[04:52:06] <akk> gry: Lots of people like using two monitors at once, side by side
[04:52:14] <akk> and being able to drag windows from one to the other, etc.
[04:52:25] <gry> you can do that when they are two different outputs too

[04:52:30] <gry> why the virtual screen feature?
[04:52:49] <akk> That is how the side-by-side thing is implemented.
[04:53:36] <akk> So e.g. if you move a window onto the monitor that's on the right, its x coordinate will be larger than the width of the monitor on the left
[04:53:51] <akk> because the (virtual) screen width is the sum of the two monitors.
[04:54:20] <akk> I'd give you a screenshot, but I can't because while fiddling with this, xrandr has just reset itself and now is using the right size.

[06:45:45] <bn_work> > -p   extract files to pipe (stdout).  Nothing but the file data is sent to stdout, and the files are always extracted in binary format, just as they are stored (no conversions).

[12:00:29] <hexnewbie> Gustavo6046: Poe's Law is the opposite of what you asked - people who appear sarcastic but aren't. You asked about some people not getting the sarcasm, which is RFC 1855 for the Internet, and damaged prefrontal cortex for real life.
[12:00:40] <Gustavo6046> Oh
[12:01:30] <Gustavo6046> really? I thought it was the opposite. Maybe I didn't read (1) with sufficient attention, (1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_Law
[12:02:08] <hexnewbie> Gustavo6046: Well, I guess the warning from RFC 1855 generally covers both, so yeah, you probably read it right

[12:03:29] <hexnewbie> Basically, the initial warning is that in the Internet sarcasm is harder to pick out even if your brain can pick sarcasm, which rises to Poe's law when you get enough population that themselves takes the views assumed to be absurd as serious.

[13:46:02] <roxlu> hi, I'm creating a function that connects to a tcp server but accepts a timeout. I'm following the steps as described in several posts (using non-blocking sockets, use select, etc.). Though when I call `connect()` I get a ECONNABORTED. I would expect a EINPROGRESS/EWOULDBLOCK. Does someone know what might cause this? I'm trying to connect to 127.0.0.1, maybe that might cause this? (or is this the
[13:46:05] <roxlu> wrong channel?)
[13:46:35] *** Joins: unixcorn_ (unixcorne@applejack.urlab.be)
[13:46:35] <phogg> this is never the wrong channel, but there might be better ones (e.g. ##programming)
[13:46:48] <phogg> there's no reason connecting to localhost would make it not work
[13:46:54] <hexnewbie> laureee: There are a multitude of ways a password makes it into a disk, it's very probable it appears in a thousand places:  Any overwrite event using the preferred method of creating a new file + rename(). Any time a program using the password was swapped out. Any time the program stored the password to a temp file to avoid passing it as a command line argument (recommended for mysql), etc.
[13:47:08] <roxlu> ok thanks phogg, I'll check ##programming too
[13:47:21] <hexnewbie> And if you use ZFS, every write to the file block creates a new copy, hence the “thousand”

[13:52:35] <hexnewbie> laureee: Safe way to overwrite a file on POSIX is to write to .file.new, then rename(".file.new", "file"); That would make copies of your password elsewhere on disk
[13:52:35] <phogg> laureee: prepare to be surprised

[14:01:57] <jim> laureee, I dunno what your needs are here, but just note that many people define "safe" as "has a backup"

That's too paranoid, regardless. If a thousand overwrites work, likely one does too. Problem in 2022 is that a thousand overwrites don't really work.

[14:08:13] <hexnewbie> laureee: Heck, writing zeroes should work just fine too. Your provider giving your disk unzeroed to someone else would demonstrate *lazy* incompetence. It would preclude your data from reappearing after a simple zeroing due to a complex storage system on the host.

[18:28:01] <domicron> quartz, the only thing a privacy VPN does, is mask your IP address to anybody who isnt capable of fingerprinting. Because you're like living in 2022, an example would be Google will know you used to use a certain ip, and suddenly you switched to a privacy VPN service - so they still know your IP right

[19:32:56] <boris[m]12> can this be an oracle thing?

[19:33:36] <tirnanog> boris[m]12: alright. I just tried ufw in a VM. 100% clean slate, ufw started from scratch. it does _not_ add any rules to the INPUT chain other than a series of rules to jump to "ufw-" prefixed custom chains. which sort of makes sense for a wrapper.

[20:21:46] <tirnanog> no politiciankit for you, xiaomiao?
[20:21:53] <deodatus> I had to switch distro
[20:22:02] <xiaomiao> tirnanog: I'm waiting for the proper rewrite
[20:22:14] <deodatus> And I found this polkit thing which kept on breaking everything
[20:22:17] <xiaomiao> that would be #7 if I didn't miscount
[20:22:18] <grodzio> if anything then polkit might hurt security more than help it
[20:22:24] <Elw3> Id like to get rid of it but meh,changing stuff makes work.

[23:50:07] <omegatron> pff - i have here a remote machine in the network, which is sometimes so extremely busy (cpu and/or network) that my local connection to it is dropped (maybe due to ssh timeouts on whichever side)

[23:50:37] <justanotheruser> any idea what other logs I might check?
[23:50:52] <justanotheruser> otherwise I'm going to turn firewall logging on and wait for it to happen again
[23:50:57] <justanotheruser> it happens maybe twice per week
[23:51:03] <ananke> justanotheruser: literally any log, look around the time when it happens.
[23:51:09] <omegatron> yes, look for intrusion detection, in case you have it installed
[23:51:26] <ananke> justanotheruser: journalctl, dmesg, /var/log/{syslog,messages}, etc

[23:51:57] <omegatron> is the remote machine physically accessible to you?
[23:52:02] <ananke> justanotheruser: for all we know it may be something like a sudden IP change
[23:52:12] <Pickchea> uwharrie, I have that installed actually, but it seems it's only for querying.
[23:52:12] <omegatron> or a plugged cable

[23:52:29] <uwharrie> if it happens at a specific cadence, have you check your DHCP lease times to see if they correlate?
[23:52:35] <ananke> justanotheruser: and without any evidence at hand, or a system that's currently affected, it's impossible to tell you what to look for
[23:53:00] <uwharrie> Pickchea: that package has config and init system files for doing things at boot

[23:54:17] <justanotheruser> I walked to the other room and power cycled to get my ssh access back
[23:54:17] <ananke> justanotheruser: uhmm, how are those different?
