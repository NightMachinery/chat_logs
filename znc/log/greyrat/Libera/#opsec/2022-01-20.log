[16:18:16] <inky_> >on purpose.
[16:20:26] <inky_> that is the problem with conspirological thinking. i value a lot the questioning of the role of the state and the government. but i think often people undervalue the power of human stupidity and the power of chaos. the world is chaotic. many players with different agendas.
[16:20:29] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[16:20:52] <Joanna> Hi inky_
[16:20:54] <inky_> i rive in one of the most militarized regions in the world.
[16:21:05] <inky_> hello, Joanna!
[16:21:26] <inky_> i don't rike living in such a region.
[16:21:42] <Joanna> I guess you had quite a lot of discussions to catch up with :)
[16:22:02] <inky_> but i see that the people, both on our and 'enemy' side are often not rational.
[16:22:33] <Joanna> I feel like almost everything I was ever told is a lie
[16:22:59] <inky_> both don't understand that the zero sum game will eventualry read to the new wac, living the other side humiliated and unsatisfied.
[16:23:25] <inky_> both sides are having trouble moderating nahionarism.
[16:23:27] <Joanna> I think we want a heroic leader to believe in but it’s all a fantasy
[16:23:50] <inky_> though i consider myself a nationalist in a sense that i am pro state.
[16:24:26] <inky_> but what i hear around is frightenitg.
[16:25:02] <inky_> and i had some aqcuaintances from their side, and i saw how strange they became during the war.
[16:25:21] <Joanna> I think sometimes you romanticize the west and I probably start to do the same with other countries
[16:26:37] <inky_> if a couple of years ago we were able to sit and discuss problems, and even share a drink (though i don't drink alcohol) but during the war they were writing such a nazi bullshit i was hardly believing my eyes.
[16:27:03] <Joanna> I’m pretty cynical by now but a lot of people still get excited about every election. I remember last year when people thought trump was going to be a hero
[16:27:06] <inky_> also i would better understand them if instead ef wcitig that they'd be on the frontline risking their lives.
[16:27:20] <inky_> as my close frdend did first day ef the war.
[16:27:26] <inky_> friend.
[16:27:54] <inky_> yes, maybe i do romantisize the west. maybe you do tde same with other countries.
[16:28:02] <Joanna> People get emotionally manipulated and then sent of to kill or be killed
[16:28:38] <inky_> i think i read a lot about the crisises and problems of western sogiety, and understand those. but i think we need to grow up to reach those problems.
[16:29:17] <inky_> moreover sometimes local armenian community discuss problems of the west and take those closer to heart than local problems.
[16:29:47] <Joanna> I used to read rt a lot and it had a lot of propaganda and military parades and bragging about how great Russia is but it also had articles that made Russia look bad .
[16:30:16] <inky_> letszsay a good example is gender pronounce. we just don't have this problem because in our language we don't have he/she, we only have one, used for both, or should i say, all genders.
[16:30:48] <inky_> i think japanese is also like that?
[16:30:54] <Joanna> That’s true , they try to get people worrying about things beyond their control and ignoring what is in front of them
[16:31:19] <inky_> rt is a shame. especially for me because tde director is ethnicly armenian.
[16:31:45] <Joanna> Japanese has different ways of talking for men and women
[16:32:04] <inky_> i think in japanese he/she/they is a same word?
[16:32:10] <inky_> oh.
[16:33:14] <Joanna> Rt I think is just as bad as western media. I stopped going there because I got tired of being ambushed with disturbing news stories. Also I caught them lying...
[16:34:10] <Joanna> In Japanese there are two ways to say I that only men use
[16:34:10] <Atque> _inky: They don't really have those words in the same way. Like kare wa means "he", but it is more commonly used for addressing boyfriends etc. Japanese people don't say "kare" very often.
[16:34:43] <Atque> Joanna: Yeah, and personal pronouns are less common in Japanese too tbh
[16:35:19] <Atque> Like... o genki desu ka? hai, genki desu. ...no pronouns there.
[16:35:31] <Atque> You, I, etc. are not said as often as in English.
[16:36:33] <Joanna> I don’t really pay too much attention to the current gender hysteria. However when I was younger I did think it was ridiculous to have to define gender for everything and tried to use word they.
[16:37:33] <Atque> Yeah, it's a pretty Anglo-American phenomena, isn't it? I wonder how it goes in languages like French, with stronger grammatical gender than English.
[16:38:02] <Joanna> There are definitely ways of communicating gender in all languages because gender is really important to know.
[16:39:27] <Joanna> Spanish is obsessed with gender even for gender less things like chairs
[16:42:01] <Joanna> Languages reveal a lot about the culture of the people using it. In some African languages they have separate words for every possible type of relative such as mothers brother is not same word as fathers brother

[16:43:06] <Joanna> Japanese language cares a lot about birth order and has different names for older and younger brothers and sisters
[16:47:47] <Atque> Joanna: Yeah, there's different honourifics for sure. I don't know if they're still used as much as textbooks may convey.
[16:49:16] <Joanna> It’s interesting how the word of I can be said so many different ways
[16:50:41] <Joanna> Atque: your name seems Spanish?
[16:51:07] <Atque> I'm not Spanish
[16:52:01] <Joanna> Didn’t think so :)

[18:17:33] <inky_> i cannot think of a way how genderzcan be communicated in armenian, other than by directly mentioning sex or husband/wife/brother/sister/mother/father positions.
[18:18:11] <inky_> from the regular sentence without a context you cannot figure out the gender.
[18:20:50] <inky_> there was a poet in constantinopolis who 'invented' 'she' for armenian and used it in his poetry
[18:21:19] <inky_> but it was not used by anyone else except him.
