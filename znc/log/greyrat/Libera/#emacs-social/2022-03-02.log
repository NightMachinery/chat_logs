[19:22:31] <GNUHacker> hi from emacs 28.0.91!
[22:50:13] <corwin> GNUHacker: o/   how goes it so far?
[22:55:31] <GNUHacker> my gtk version is old, emacs crash (27 and 28 version) with multiples frames
[22:57:46] <corwin> Oh, ouch.  Probably needs upgraded, that.
[22:58:16] <GNUHacker> Ive this issue https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/221
[23:00:16] <corwin> Wow, reading this you can understand where emacs devs (like Po) seem to be frustrated with the GTK team. > This bug has become entirely pointless.
[23:00:46] <corwin> User: it crashes my system  Dev: *closing "useless" bug report*
[23:03:10] <GNUHacker> yeeah
[23:03:39] <GNUHacker> maybe must I compile emacs without gtk? idk

[23:50:26] <aidalgol> FWIW, I'm not opposed to messing with internet infrastructure to hurt the Russian government; I'm opposed to the scorched-earth response of completely nuking every .ru domain.
[23:50:27] <corwin> fair warning: IDK if it will happen but a political discussion might move here from #emacs
