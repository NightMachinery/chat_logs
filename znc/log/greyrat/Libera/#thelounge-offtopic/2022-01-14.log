[01:37:12] * xnaas moves from main chat
[01:37:13] * xnaas coughs
[01:37:14] * bookworm waits patiently
[01:37:26] <xnaas> Microsoft encourages emoji passwords and then removes a shitload of them
[01:37:32] <xnaas> including, but not limited to ðŸ–•
[01:37:33] <xnaas> smh
[01:37:38] <shadoozo> no coughing!!!! keep distance!!! :P
[01:37:53] <xnaas> I'm finally the last person in the office, just took my mask off not too long ago.
[01:37:55] <xnaas> Feels so free.
[01:37:56] <xnaas> :P
[01:38:03] <bookworm> did they?
[01:38:22] <xnaas> Microsoft will render ðŸ–•, but you can't type it with their emoji keyboard.
[01:38:24] <bookworm> can they even? I mean just literally emit the bytes
[01:38:26] <xnaas> Same with all flags.
[01:38:31] <bookworm> o god...
[01:38:45] <xnaas> Of course, you can still make flags the old fashioned way
[01:38:49] <xnaas> with two letters
[01:38:56] <xnaas> but that's just ridiculous :P
[01:38:58] <bookworm> about as nice as Android making a fucking water pistol out of a real one because a real one is offensive
[01:39:14] <xnaas> https://emojipedia.org/pistol/
[01:39:16] <xnaas> they all did it
[01:39:18] <xnaas> basically
[01:39:18] <xnaas> :/
[01:39:19] <bookworm> I mean come on there are nations out there that aren't as prude as the US
[01:39:55] <xnaas> I assume the ones that still show real guns are old, no longer updated emoji sets.
[01:40:05] * xnaas hasn't bothered to verify, however
[01:41:34] <bookworm> I wouldn't use any chars in a password that I couldn't type on a run of the mill keyboard in my country though
[01:41:41] <bookworm> that'd be stupid
[01:41:50] <xnaas> I haven't typed a password in ages!
[01:42:05] * xnaas is exaggerating
[01:42:14] <bookworm> I do all the time... need to unluck my computer and pw store somehow right
[01:42:15] <xnaas> For my system logon password, I concur.
[01:42:25] <bookworm> unlock*
[01:49:17] <xnaas> Got curious and tested it. ergo lets you set and use emoji passwords no problem lol
[01:49:19] <xnaas> idk about libera
[01:52:37] <bookworm> none of them should care
[01:53:18] <bookworm> all they need to do is shove the raw bytes into a hash function (which is all just byte input anyhow) and compare the hash to the stored one
[01:55:25] <bookworm> if they look at the pw in any way it's broken
[01:59:13] * xnaas operates under the assumption everything is broken garbage until proven otherwise
[02:00:02] <xnaas> I mean, you've used the web ever in your life; you've seen all sorts of awful, horrible, "lowercase letters only, up to 12 characters" and other trash lol
[02:19:26] <Snuupy> bookworm is too good for emojis in their password
[02:24:35] <xnaas> Obviously he just needs to get a Logitech Pop keyboard or whatever
[02:24:40] <xnaas> the one with the emoji buttons
[02:24:58] <xnaas> (or any good keyboard you can program any keypresses/characters into :P )
