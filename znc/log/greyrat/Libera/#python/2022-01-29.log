[00:02:49] <lseactuary> sorry i made a mistake
[00:02:54] <SnoopJ> mike18_, yes. Not for what you're doing, though. Probably you need to group your URLs before you send them to your workers.
[00:03:08] <mike18_> SnoopJ: how to group?
[00:03:17] <fdsdf> not really
[00:03:33] *** climax is now known as gentooclimax
[00:03:39] <SnoopJ> mike18_, the itertools docs have an example of a function that can do this. The more_itertools library also provides it.
[00:03:48] <nedbat> fdsdf: what win32 systems are you considering? You can't assume Python is installed on any of them, so where is the 2.5 number from?

[00:04:51] <SnoopJ> mike18_, if you want to give each worker multiple URLs, you will need to give each worker multiple URLs. So, grouping them will be the first step here.

[00:12:25] <BrenBarn> what does "search the value in self.hierarchy" mean?

[00:15:34] <BrenBarn> ok, so next question is did you read the documentation for `successors`?
[00:15:37] <novapy> Can someone look at my pkg config and tell me what im messing up: https://bpaste.net/M4FA
[00:15:46] <lseactuary> yes, it includes all children, so it wont work
[00:16:06] <lseactuary> but i was at least trying to get B,D,E for A, at the moment im not even getting this
[00:16:15] <lseactuary> which means i think the tree is not building correct?
[00:16:30] <BrenBarn> D?  there's no D in your example
[00:16:45] <lseactuary> sorry i was looking at another screen
[00:17:04] <lseactuary> B,C,E
[00:17:19] <BrenBarn> the documentation for successor says "A successor of n is a node m such that there exists a directed edge from n to m."
[00:17:19] <BrenBarn> i.e., that is only "direct" children
[00:17:22] <jinsun> novapy: looks fine (the indentation in build-system requires is a bit bad but that doesn't really matter I think)
[00:17:31] <BrenBarn> your example gives `["B", "E"]` because those are the only nodes that you can get to from A
[00:17:34] <mike18_> SnoopJ: is it called grouper or groupby?

[00:18:47] <lseactuary> can you show me?
[00:18:51] <BrenBarn> also, your graph includes a None node so that is going to show up as a leaf node
[00:19:10] <SnoopJ> mike18_, groupby() is a method defined in itertools that does not do what you want. grouper() is a function that exists only in the documentation that does what you want.
[00:20:22] <jinsun> novapy: no, it needs to have the stuff you need to build you package, if you use setup.cfg then you want setuptools there, and wheel to build wheels

[00:42:18] <SnoopJ> lseactuary, that error indicates that a Series is being hashed somewhere, probably as an attempt to use it as the key in a dict.
[00:42:21] <novapy> Should I not have?
[00:42:30] <SnoopJ> (and indeed, Series are mutable and therefore not hashable)

[00:42:43] <lseactuary> BrenBarn  -- yes the code was very helpful, thank you!
[00:42:45] <SnoopJ> lseactuary, it means that the object can change, so trying to compute its hash is total nonsense
[00:42:51] <BrenBarn> that error can arise if you try to use a Series as a node in a graph for example
[00:43:10] <BrenBarn> (because networkx graphs require the nodes to be hashable)

[00:45:49] <FMBR> Hi guys, I have a super dumb question since... well, haven't used Python in a few years.
[00:45:50] <FMBR> Basically, trying to use os.walk to proceed over a bunch of files that have multiple versions (eg file_v0001.txt thru file_v0004.txt) and I only want to keep the latest one.  That's not a problem, however, I can't seem to figure out the logic to stay in that directory and not also grab the next directory, if that makes sense.  Logically the
[00:45:50] <FMBR> answer is "while root doesn't change it's name do thing" but I'm not sure how to go about doing that.  Basic paste here: https://bpa.st/TQFQ mostly just to show off the folder structure since it's pretty much just a basic os.walk
[00:45:57] <lseactuary> SnoopJ  i still dont get the error. in the example i have a pandas dataframe also which is a series?
[00:47:01] <nedbat> FMBR: you could use os.walk to just visit the directories, and then os.listdir to get the files in the directory.
[00:47:59] <mike18_> SnoopJ: please some feedback to: https://ideone.com/VGYHIV
[00:48:20] <novapy> jinsun__: yeah it was in the tree, it was feedutils.py, heres the error: https://bpaste.net/K5RA

[04:28:46] <sveinse> First attempt: aiohttp with json API and react frontend. Data from aiohttp is very fast, but rendering in react is slow (2s). Second attempt: aiohttp+jinja2. Slow (3s). Third attempt: uwsgi cgi+jinja2. Slower (4.4s). Winner: Ye old uwsgi CGI script (820ms)

[04:50:49] <c4017w_> I have a python/javascript question. I have a simple python script that does `sys.stdout.write("\n"); sys.exit(0)`, and I'm running this via `child_process` in javascript. However, the child_process returns "\r\n"! I'm trying to figure out at which point the conversion is happening. Is sys.stdout converting it based on some 'console type' flag coming from child_process? Or is child_process converting it when it receives it?

[05:57:04] <sveinse> is execute_... a regular blocking function? I don't see any await statements
[05:57:36] <lseactuary> yeah
[05:57:52] <lseactuary> for results in results: execute_query(result)
[05:58:04] <lseactuary> is basically execute_query(select blah from table;)
[05:58:11] <lseactuary> results is a list
[05:58:17] <lseactuary> with 2000+ sql queries
[05:58:24] <lseactuary> so im trying to batch process not sequential process
[05:58:34] <lseactuary> in the function execute_query i already call a new server
[05:58:53] <lseactuary> so i think i can use asyncio to create multiple tasks and send off batches of 100 result from results?
[05:59:29] <sveinse> Then no, asyncio is a concurrent library, not paralell execution, so you'll need an async sql library for that. Once you call a blocking call in an async function it'll block everything else

[06:02:10] *** Quits: JordiGH (~jordi@user/jordigh) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[06:02:13] <sveinse> No, not at the same time, but concurrently. That is, only one is running at any given time, but it will multiplex between the various tasks on what it executes.
[06:03:28] <sveinse> But if the sql library were async, it would have been written as await execute_query() and it'll send off the request and do something else while waiting for the reply
[06:03:36] <lseactuary> if a function exeuctes 100 things on a server, then executing this function twice will work no?
[06:03:42] <lseactuary> i dont want sequential basically
[06:03:45] <lseactuary> i want in parallel
[06:05:02] <sveinse> If your execute_query() is blocking, then no, it won't work
[06:05:09] <lseactuary> what does blocking mean
[06:05:37] <sveinse> you call it in python and wait an amount of time until you get a value returned
[06:06:05] <lseactuary> ah
[06:06:10] <lseactuary> no its not blocking
[06:06:15] <lseactuary> i dont need a result from it

[06:07:09] <sveinse> Then you can do for...: execute_query() and be done with it, right?
[06:07:28] <lseactuary> yes but that will run each query in the list sequentially
[06:07:43] <lseactuary> say its [select 1 from table, select 2 from table, select 3 from table]

[06:08:46] <sveinse> well, then your execute_query() is blocking, since it doesn't fire them all in quick succession
[06:08:49] *** Joins: Elodin (~weechat@user/elodin)
[06:09:24] <lseactuary> right but i can do like for results in result: execute_query(results[0:100]) and then next line execute_query(results[101:200])
[06:09:32] <lseactuary> issue is execute_query(results[101:200]) runs after execute_query(results[0:100])
[06:09:36] <lseactuary> not in parallel
[06:10:37] <lseactuary> you know what i mean?
[06:11:21] <sveinse> and you won't be able to change that unless you use a sql library that is built for async or starts with multiple threads

[06:11:31] <lseactuary> but its a functio
[06:11:42] <sveinse> ?
[06:11:43] <lseactuary> it still will run query 0...100 sequentially
[06:11:48] <lseactuary> and 101...200 sequentially
[06:11:50] <lseactuary> that is fine
[06:11:57] <lseactuary> but 0...10 can be run on one server
[06:12:01] <lseactuary> and 101...200 on another
[06:12:02] <lseactuary> no?
[06:13:07] <lseactuary> execute_query sends the SQL's to a server so we can parallelise the function call, not the internals of the function

[06:13:45] <sveinse> In async I would write something like this:   for result in results:  asyncio.create_task(execute_query(some_parameter))  This would fire off results number of concurrent requests. But this requires that the sql lib, execute_query, is an async function.

[10:04:42] <SnoopJ> energizer, BrenBarn I believe what's happening there is that it's being tokenized to NAME as "𝕋𝕣𝕦𝕖", and then the grammar rule that issues the expected SyntaxError will fire, and *then* you'll pass through NFKC on your way to a Name node in the resulting AST, and from there you're on easy street: you get exactly what you'd expect from the UAX #31 support, vars() contains "True" and not
[10:04:44] <SnoopJ> "𝕋𝕣𝕦𝕖", but the latter normalizes to the former when you go looking for a name *at runtime.*

[11:16:03] <SnoopJ> energizer, hmm, I think I see what you're saying.
[11:17:27] <energizer> so in my reading the emphasis is on the point that they must be in an ascii superset

[11:18:42] <energizer> and if you leave that to python's unicode, it will use locale.getpreferredencoding(), which means the ops person now needs to have read the spec
[11:19:06] <energizer> so the library should not do that
[11:20:19] * SnoopJ nods
[11:21:35] <SnoopJ> The library has not necessarily implemented HTTP because the locale cannot be guaranteed to be consistent with the spec
[11:22:02] <SnoopJ> but (unfortunately!) the unreliable behavior will genreally be correct...except when it isn't and then it might be really pernicious

[15:58:43] <lola> I have a question? we were using mkdir for replicantOS project wiki migration scripts, but we realise we need to use makedirs instead, nontheless Im not sure if we should keep the same arguments for permissions in folders. in "os.makedirs(parent_dir_path, mode=0o777, exist_ok=False)"
[15:58:43] <lola> Given it was suggested for "Permission errors when directory is created with priveliges, [...]" it's not an issue, as users are expected to handle that instead
[15:58:43] <lola> The right fix is something like that (assuming your user is irelativism): chown irelativism:irelativism -R $PWD.

[16:08:19] <petaflot> if there are no coins, raise an exception (because since the X-Y grid is distributed, the fact I do't have a pile does't mean my friend over there doesn't have a pile on _his_ grid ; so if I have no pile there - and before saying "nothing-is-here" I need to ask my friends)

[19:37:17] <The-Compiler> Deneb: https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial_api.html#serial.Serial.read - "With no timeout it will block until the requested number of bytes is read."
[19:37:46] <coc0nut> does 'if variable == "1" or "01"' do any difference from 'if variable == "1"' im curious because im making a calculator with different math operations. when i used "1" or "01" all operations turned additions instead of multiplication, division and so on
[19:38:10] <bjs> coc0nut: `if variable == "1" or "01"` is the same as `if variable == ("1" or "01")` which is the same as `if variable == "1"` yes
[19:38:16] <bjs> maybe you meant `if variable == "1" or variable == "01"` ?
[19:38:24] <coc0nut> okok
[19:38:29] <coc0nut> thx :D

[19:38:49] <Deneb> The-Compiler: thanks, but I don't know the expected number of bytes. The program ust has to si waiting until a burst of data appears. The burst in not terminated (i.e it is binary data not CRLF terminated text). When something appears it has to capture it and pass it to the program for processing. Will give read(0 a go though.
[19:38:57] <Deneb> *read()
[19:39:21] <The-Compiler> Deneb: huh, and your burst of data has no kind of terminator?
[19:39:54] <The-Compiler> Deneb: usually even binary protocols have either a size somewhere, or a marker marking the end of data, it's very unusual to have to guess based on bursts

[19:47:21] <Deneb> The-Compiler: the data length does follow a pattern in that there is a pre-able, a data header, a data block of 512 bytes plus checksum all of which are of a predicatble size and combine to fdorm a dataset, but the burst can include multiple datasets which makes it difficult to predict the total length of the data

[23:46:44] <SnoopJ> I have used Qt and wxPython, I would say wxPython was the simpler of the two but that was one major version ago, I have no idea what it's like now. Qt is powerful but you really have to get into its mindset. I hear good things about the pyside bindings, though.

[23:48:15] <mmalter> It's funny after all those decades how gui programming is still an area of CS that hasn't been solved once and for all
[23:48:43] <SnoopJ> yes the docs are a little cryptic

[23:49:33] <mmalter> SnoopJ: Well, if you want to pass a packet from one computer to the other, usually nobody really talks about it, people use TCP IP
