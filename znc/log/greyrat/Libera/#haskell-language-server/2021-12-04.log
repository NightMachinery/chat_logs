[20:23:56] <anton-latukha[m]> One of the thing that it may be possible to address - is to detect targets & run only needed tests, with probably can be done through the skip-duplicate-actions or in other way - but would need quite a work & increase the complexity of the CI. But that of course means tests would run partial & so the primary thing is that a bunch of tests seem unstable. And you already knew that 8)
[20:25:36] <anton-latukha[m]> I am just sitting here the second day waiting for the tests to pass in the puzzlement are those because of changes in CI code, or it is randomness.
[20:28:36] <anton-latukha[m]> Just wanted to sort-out is it me, or share the experience.

[21:58:13] <anton-latukha[m]> One of the things possible, that may improve the situation - is to enable `--enable-deterministic` on builds, maybe it would somewhat increase the stability of build results.
[22:00:12] <anton-latukha[m]> Or it is removed from Cabal docs & that may mean it now enabled always?
[22:01:11] <jneira[m]> hi! 
[22:01:53] <jneira[m]> testa are flaky indeed, and windows+9.0.1 get stuck quite frequently
[22:02:16] <anton-latukha[m]> Nope. It is just not documented:
[22:02:33] <anton-latukha[m]> command cabal v2-build --help | rg deterministic
[22:02:33] <anton-latukha[m]>  --enable-deterministic         Enable Try to be as deterministic as possible
[22:02:33] <anton-latukha[m]>  --disable-deterministic        Disable Try to be as deterministic as possible
[22:02:34] <jneira[m]> for rerun a workflow you can try add a comment with `/rerun-workflow <workflow-name>`
[22:02:54] <jneira[m]> for example `/rerun-workflow Testing`
[22:03:58] <jneira[m]> please dont remove the `concurrency`section, yesterday i had to cancel a bunch of bench workflows from your pr to make room for the other prs about to be merged
[22:05:05] <jneira[m]> you want enable deterministic to fix or alliviate flaky tests or for other reason?
[22:07:00] <jneira[m]> for alliviate flaky tests i am trying to reuse the tasty logs between attempts of the same run, once one matrix job is sucesful, it will not be tried again in the next attempt, so it will not fail (and the run will be faster)
[22:07:31] <jneira[m]> (the proper fix is trace the root cause and fix it of course, but it will take some time)
[22:11:48] <anton-latukha[m]> <jneira[m]> "please dont remove the `..." <- I talk in above messages. GitHub stopped allowing main `concurrency` entry in the PR.
[22:11:58] <anton-latukha[m]> It literally built with the code.
[22:12:30] <anton-latukha[m]> & next day I advanced the hackage timestemp & github was blocking on concurrency entry.
[22:12:56] <anton-latukha[m]> * was blocking all workflows in PR on concurrency
[22:13:12] <anton-latukha[m]> * github was repeatedly blocking, * blocking all workflows in PR on concurrency
[22:15:17] <anton-latukha[m]> It was blocking on:
[22:15:17] <anton-latukha[m]> ```
[22:15:17] <anton-latukha[m]> group: ${{ github.head_ref }}-${{ github.workflow }}
[22:15:17] <anton-latukha[m]> ```
[22:15:42] <anton-latukha[m]> I removed the `concurrency` entries & PR code became working again.
[22:16:26] <anton-latukha[m]> s/I removed the `concurrency` entries & PR code became working again./Therefore I removed the `concurrency` entries & marked that commit to reversal before merge & PR code then worked as nothing happened./
[22:16:48] <anton-latukha[m]> `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`
[22:20:42] <anton-latukha[m]> Therefore way back when we talked about HLint - I said about quota situations that arise when one runs the setup & CI builds a bunch. I keep encountering a lot of things like this, especially during CI development.
