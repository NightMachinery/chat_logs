[06:39:54] <AhmedAmerican> sorry skip `Dr,` it's happens with `Jr.,`
[06:40:38] <AhmedAmerican> sometimes `Jr;` :S
[06:47:22] <AhmedAmerican> full case is here https://regex101.com/r/U7AtJO/1 some records cached correctly and some not.
[06:51:37] <digitok> can you use 'regex' module or only 're'
[06:54:06] <AhmedAmerican> i can use regex yes.
[06:55:12] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/JIttkh/2

[14:23:07] <digitok> well, if your javascript version supports lookarounds, you can use (?<=<)\w+(?=>)
[14:23:41] <digitok> but the more common approach would be <(\w+)> where "div" would the full match would be "<div>", and "div" would be returned in group 1
[14:23:47] <UltraBlackLinux> So the lookarounds allow you to search for a character but not include it in the match?
[14:23:57] <digitok> yep
[14:24:17] <UltraBlackLinux> and why the = and the double < at the start?
[14:24:20] <digitok> s/where "div" would/where/
[14:24:21] <rebot> 14digitok meant: but the more common approach would be <(\w+)> 07where14 the full match would be "<div>", and "div" would be returned in group 1
[14:24:51] <digitok> the first one is a positive lookbehind (?<= ...) and the second one is a positive lookahead (?= ...)
[14:24:59] <digitok> the other < and > are literal
[14:25:03] <UltraBlackLinux> oh interesting
[14:25:09] <UltraBlackLinux> okay thank you!

[14:28:16] <UltraBlackLinux> For clarification, this was the challenge: https://regexone.com/problem/matching_html - and (?<=<)(\w+) worked
[14:29:31] <digitok> ok, then you do not need the lookbehind

[20:42:38] <re101-sloth-25> hello guys
[20:42:41] <re101-sloth-25> I have a regex https://regex101.com/r/xgOXMK/1
[20:44:30] <re101-sloth-25> I want to fix this regex so that a string containing any type of character without spaces must start with / and may end with /
[20:45:37] <re101-sloth-25> some samples -
[20:45:52] <VectorX> https://regex101.com/r/xgOXMK/2
[20:46:24] <VectorX> thats any type of character without spaces
[20:47:03] <re101-sloth-25> thanks for sharing. it's not matching 2nd and 4th sample
[20:47:08] <mysticspiral[m]> ^\/\S+$
[20:47:43] <VectorX> sorry I missed that, https://regex101.com/r/xgOXMK/3
[20:50:03] <re101-sloth-25> thanks for sharing I added one more sample
[20:50:06] <re101-sloth-25> https://regex101.com/r/xgOXMK/4
[20:50:19] <re101-sloth-25> 5th one - this should not pass the regex

[20:54:12] <re101-sloth-25> wow!!!
[20:54:18] <re101-sloth-25> amazing

[21:27:56] <Wellso> I'm struggling with backreferences... and regex in general :(
[21:28:22] <Wellso> I'm trying to match the first group (Assisi), and then match the content of that group multiple times throughout the text but I'm a bit lost how I do it
[21:28:31] <Wellso> https://regex101.com/r/fg7ux7/1
[21:37:49] <karhunkynsi> Will there always be a random character in between?
[21:40:10] <Wellso> yeah its kind of like a sentence where Assisi has been inserted between letters
[21:40:23] <Wellso> The outputs meant to read Offri servizi di trasloco a Cerignola con Ernesto
[21:40:32] <karhunkynsi> And you want to remove Assisi?
[21:40:50] <Wellso> yeah, but I have other examples and I think there must be a common solution to them all
[21:41:06] <karhunkynsi> Right, i see.
[21:41:11] <Wellso> trying to get some something reusable
[21:41:26] <Wellso> sorry, its a weird technical test that I'm struggling with
[21:43:34] <Wellso> its like I need to match the first full word up until the next capital letter, which I've kind of done with a group, but then I need to match against the result of that group
[21:45:46] <mysticspiral[m]> this one works when it may use the last word instead https://regex101.com/r/fg7ux7/2
[21:46:13] <mysticspiral[m]> cant you use two regex's?
[21:46:32] <mysticspiral[m]> one for getting the word and then use the result in the second regex?
[21:46:58] <Wellso> yeah maybe that's the logical step and I'm over complicating it
