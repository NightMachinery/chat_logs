[05:17:11] <lalia> Still not sure what's to say about JP, but I'm also way over caring to figure it out. It's not an issue for philosophy communities outside of online spaces: he never comes up.
[05:17:34] <lalia> So I mean... no idea. :D
[05:19:28] <Thilastiko> what "philosophy communities" do you hang out in?
[05:19:56] <T3ddy> what do you mean if he was honest he'd be an atheist
[05:20:02] <T3ddy> don't you mean agnostic?
[05:20:56] <lalia> Mostly either academic communities like SPEP or the APS or otherwise education-based organizations like P4C and Ethics Bowl.
[05:21:05] <Thilastiko> nope, he be just another "new atheist". same as Sam Harris
[05:21:12] <lalia> Thilastiko: but also a few special interest groups having to do with Attic Greek and skepticism.

[05:22:48] <lalia> I'm working on some scholarship related to ancient skepticism ATM.
[05:23:39] <lalia> And I'm real interested in skepticism as it relates to epistemic disagreement.
[05:24:09] <Thilastiko> ... I've only read a little plato and aristotle....
[05:24:40] <lalia> Plato and Attic tragedy are the areas I've spent the most time on since grad school.
[05:25:01] <lalia> Aristotle to some degree too... but I'm a lot less interested in his work TBH.
[05:25:03] <Thilastiko> coolio, so where is the lost city of atlantis??
[05:25:17] <lalia> More than likely in Plato's head. :D

[05:25:45] <T3ddy> it's near the azores islands lol
[05:25:53] <Thilastiko> everyone should be aristotle-like, but not "Aristotelian"

[05:27:26] <Thilastiko> he never meant to start a BS field for mideval theologans to waste their lives in

[05:28:20] <Thilastiko> metaphysics is just the name of the book aristotl's students put all the stuff he wrote after he wrote the book "physics"
[05:28:42] <Thilastiko> it was not intended to signify a "branch" of philosophy
[05:29:00] <lalia> That sounds like a standard opinion on how to read Aristotle's surviving corpus. I'm just not into it.
[05:29:06] <lalia> Not a hater tho. :)
[05:29:14] <lalia> Just an opinionated classicist.
[05:29:31] <Thilastiko> like derrida..?
[05:29:50] <Thilastiko> just make it up, the experts are too busey to disagree wit hyou
[05:30:42] <lalia> Maybe? Maybe like Nietszche a little bit too, but honestly probably neither. I've spent years developing my own stances on the ancient records based on research evidence. :)
[05:30:58] <lalia> So probably more like my own bullshit at this point really.

[05:32:54] <lalia> Not sure about that, my area has been mostly focused on the socratic Plato pieces and tragic narratives like the fall of the house of Atreus.

[05:33:28] <lalia> It takes a lot.

[05:44:16] <lucky> and I guess that's about as close to defining metaphysics (as popularly used today) I could get right now
[05:44:22] <lucky> anyway it's time for my evening walk bbl :)

[05:52:01] <brigand> you're relaxing through horror narratives?
[05:52:13] <lalia> AD&D is the one that used thac0 but there was also a more basic ruleset that avoided those mechanics.

[05:52:53] <lalia> Ravachol's default storyline for the game is escaping from a werewolf attack.

[06:02:37] <lalia> Nice family. Dexter's a cool cat too, last I checked. And real successful too: I think he has his own hot sauce now. :D
[06:02:40] <brigand> some songs are good. sometimes his voice is a bit unnerving though xD
[06:02:53] <lalia> Did you know he's got a PhD?
[06:02:58] <brigand> no
[06:03:19] <lalia> molecular biology
[06:03:23] <lalia> Wild guy.
[06:03:57] <brigand> nice
[06:05:26] <brigand> have you got a phd?

[06:06:24] <lalia> No, I'm an eternal grad student. I got a decent teaching job before I finished my thesis. :P
[06:06:39] <lalia> Someday maybe.
[06:06:43] <lalia> We'll see, I guess.
[06:08:01] <brigand> aren't we all eternal students? :p
[06:08:08] <Thilastiko> your project could be how to break the curse of the atreids
[06:08:46] <lalia> brigand: a solid outlook really. :)
[06:09:49] <lalia> Thilastiko: according to Aeschylus, this was achieved through the trial of Orestes and the advent of the Athenian court system.
[06:09:58] <lalia> There's a lot of text on it already. :P
[06:10:05] <lalia> I'm gonna avoid that topic actually.
[06:10:37] <Thilastiko> is that why the spartans were always digging up his bones?
[06:11:13] <Thilastiko> the curse is apparently still around 30,000 years in the future, in Dune
[06:12:15] <lalia> Thilastiko: the deal with Orestes bones had to do with fulfilling a prophecy related to ensuring victory in a decisive battle.
[06:12:26] <Thilastiko> coolio
[06:12:27] <lalia> I can't remember a lot about it tho, that's not really my area.
[06:13:00] <lalia> The histories are cool and I've worked through them before but it's been ages.
[06:13:01] <Thilastiko> you ever notice that the cursed people in greek mythology are named after earth=tone colors?
[06:13:07] <Thilastiko> pelops-brown
[06:13:08] <lalia> :D
[06:13:12] <Thilastiko> atri - black
[06:13:38] <Thilastiko> was it the cursed king gave his name to the color? or vice versa?
[06:16:22] <lalia> Might review some of Descartes commetary from a few texts tonight just to refresh my perspective on his so-called method of doubt.
[06:16:34] <lalia> Rules for the Direction of the Mind is overlooked a little too often, IMO.
[06:16:50] <lalia> It's a great read along side Method.
[06:17:44] <lalia> Haven't been through it in some years tho. Hopefully I find something I've missed before this time. Fingers crossed.
[06:21:37] <brigand> wish i could stay concentrated even for a short book

[06:32:48] <brigand> yeah, i just thought about it xD i gave it to my sis as a present

[20:47:12] <brigand> yo my man
[20:47:33] <Autoclesis> hey brigand
[20:48:15] <brigand> hi Autoclesis
[20:49:25] <Autoclesis> What philosophic topics have been puzzling the good folks here of late?
[20:51:35] <brigand> .wt Autoclesis
[20:51:36] <ro-bot-o> [wiktionary] Autoclesis — noun: 1. (rhetoric) The arousing of interest in something by mentioning it in a negative or dismissive way
[20:52:00] <brigand> the latest topic was garden work
[20:52:24] <brigand> before i shared this but nobody cared http://youtu.be/uJmlwumQke0
[20:52:25] <ro-bot-o> [YouTube] ⁨GTAA Philosophy Friday Livestream: Philosophy and Humor w/Brian Mondy⁩ | 1h 36m 23s | Channel: ⁨Ben Burgis⁩ | 475 views | 2021-07-17 - 01:45:40
[20:55:25] <Autoclesis> That's a pretty good definition.
[20:55:35] <Autoclesis> But it need not be negative. More like, "at all"
[20:56:34] <brigand> arousing interest by just mentioning it?
[20:56:57] <Autoclesis> Yes, that was my understanding in the book where I came across it
[20:57:15] <Autoclesis> A lot of these rhetorical terms are rarely used
[20:57:31] <Autoclesis> We might say "mere exposure effect" these days
[21:03:00] <brigand> i will use it next time someone does it
[21:03:40] <Autoclesis> :)
