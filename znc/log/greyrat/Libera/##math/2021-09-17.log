[04:42:17] <harwiltz> Hello all. I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the proof that Zorn's lemma => choice given in Terry Tao's "An epsilon of room". It looks to me like he's using choice in the proof, which of course doesn't make sense.
[04:43:02] <twoisprime> PlanckWalk: Right, so the law of excluded middle does not apply here
[04:43:34] <PlanckWalk> The law of excluded middle would say "either 60% of all penguins are male, or it is not true that 60% of all penguins are male"
[04:43:48] <twoisprime> I would tend to agree
[04:44:03] <harwiltz> Basically he starts by defining a partial choice function as a pair (F, f) where f is a choice function for F, which is a subset of P(X) (powerset of X). He then shows that there's a maximal partial choice function. But how can you justify the existence of these partial choice functions without the axiom of choice?
[04:44:05] <twoisprime> So I'm still looking for the name of the logical (argument?)

[04:45:28] <PlanckWalk> It's just arithmetic
[04:45:47] <twoisprime> No, that was just an example.
[04:46:13] <twoisprime> The arithmetic part isn't really the heart of the argument
[04:46:29] <twoisprime> It's more that if you argue that one must be true, then you're also arguing that the other must be true as well

[05:10:35] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: by the way, did you ever work out what your z |-> z + 1/z  does visually? Let |z| > 1 and Im(z) > 0.  Say Re(z) > 0 too, so z is strictly in the first quadrant, and going from 0 to z goes up by some positive angle theta = arg(z) and some length > 1.  But now 1/z has length < 1 and has angle -theta, so start at z and now adding 1/z means you travel back down at angle -theta, but now you still end up strictly in the first
[05:10:35] <Z-module> quadrant since the incremental length you go is |1/z| < 1 < |z|.    Similarly if Re(z) = 0, adding 1/z just comes back down along the vertical axis but using a distance < |z| so you're still in the upper half-plane. Similarly for Re(z) < 0.
[05:11:45] <Z-module> and it's not that hard to show that every point in the upper half-plane is reachable this way.

[09:25:08] <tusko> I don't understand multiplicative inverses with respect to modular arithmetic
[09:25:52] <qergle> they are defined thusly. x and y are multiplicative inverses mod m, if xy=1 (mod m)
[09:27:05] *** Joins: rain3 (~rain3___@2a02:2f09:d100:8700:1ae4:6be9:2a58:7de6)
[09:27:15] <qergle> now not all numbers (mod m) have multiplicative inverses. it is a necessary (and sufficient) condition that the number be coprime with the modulus.
[09:28:28] <tusko> oh, actually that's the most clear explanation I've seen all night
[09:29:09] <tusko> So if xy are coprime with m, their product is congruent to 1 mod m?
[09:29:26] <somiaj> Finding them is the tricky part, though the general eculidan algoritim is one of the most efficent.
[09:29:32] <somiaj> tusko: no
[09:29:43] <somiaj> tusko: if xy = 1 mod m, then x and y are coprime with m
[09:29:47] <qergle> no, if gcd(x,m)=1 then x has a multiplicative inverse mod m. and that inverse (call it y) is such that x*y=1 (mod m)
[09:30:04] <somiaj> but just because x,y are coprime with m isn't enough to be inverses.
[09:30:17] <tusko> oh
[09:30:25] <qergle> if gcd(x,m)>1 then x doesn't have a multiplicative inverse (mod m)
[09:30:46] <somiaj> though corpime is enough to ensure existance of an inverse, finding it is still a chore.
[09:31:09] <qergle> so, as an example, 3 doesn't have an inverse (mod 6). there is no y where 3y=1 (mod 6)
[09:31:27] <qergle> but it does have one (mod 7). there does exist a y such that 3y=1 (mod 7)
[09:32:09] <pikapika> qergle, is the inverse unique
[09:32:16] <qergle> why not 6 but yes 7? because gcd(3,6)=3 (not coprime) and gcd(3,7)=1 (coprime).
[09:32:23] <qergle> pikapika: you tell me
[09:32:33] <tusko> So I have that x = 3 mod 7 and x = 4 mod 9. Using the information that x = 7y+3 = 4 mod 9 I tried to reduce it down. It seems clear that 7y = 1 mod 9.
[09:32:34] <pikapika> well I mean besides the fact of higher multiples
[09:32:52] <tusko> Maybe the takeaway there is that 7 is the multiplicative inverse of y?
[09:33:14] <qergle> tusko: come again?
[09:33:18] <tusko> I hadn't noticed that

[09:33:48] <tusko> but then is there some operation that I can use to simplify 7y = 1 mod 9
[09:33:54] <somiaj> pikapika: depends on what you mean by uniquness
[09:34:33] <qergle> tusko: i don't know what you're doing now., you're solving a system of congruences?
[09:34:52] <tusko> That's right, but more I'm trying to understand how these are solved procedurally.
[09:35:10] <tusko> I've read about 4 artickles on the chinese remainder thm and I just can't piece it together.
[09:35:50] <qergle> ok, that's a very important theorem to understand, you should invest in getting it right.
[09:36:16] <qergle> don't move on until you understand it completely
[09:36:58] <tusko> N = n1n2 = 7*9 = 63. r1 = 3, r2 = 4. and so sum_[i=1 \to 2] r_iNx_i = (3*63x_1) + (4*63x_2)
[09:37:09] <qergle> btw, it used to to be that you could google "crt" and get tons of beautiful sites about the chinese remainder theorem. now all you get are u.s. based sites about "critical race theory"
[09:37:19] <qergle> is that an indication of the impending apocalypse?
[09:38:10] <tusko> Is it a valid operation to say 7y + 3 = 4 mod 9 => 7y = 1 mod 9?
[09:38:31] <qergle> no
[09:38:41] <tusko> ofc not, I'm such a blockhead
[09:39:03] <qergle> oh sorry, yes
[09:39:28] <qergle> i'm the blockhead, i misread and thought you get -1 (mod 9) when you subtract 3
[09:39:51] <qergle> you can add and subtract to both sides of a congruence as you normally do with an equality
[09:40:26] <tusko> What is it about 7y = 1 mod 9 that allows me to find the unique solution (promised by crt) of x = 3 mod 7 and x = 4 mod 9?
[09:41:23] <qergle> 7 is guaranteed an inverse (mod 9) because 7 and 9 are coprime.
[09:41:45] <qergle> in other words, that y does exist.
[09:41:47] <tusko> right, that's what I'm thinking is its something to do with y being the multiplicative inverse of 7 mod 9
[09:42:10] <tusko> so y is the solution?
[09:42:21] <pikapika> tusko oh right I am dumb
[09:42:34] <pikapika> Anything 3y+7 will also be an inverse
[09:42:41] <pikapika> but yeah in that sense of the smallest y
[09:42:43] <pikapika> is that unique
[09:43:05] <pikapika> I meant y+7k is also an inverse if y is one
[09:43:21] <pikapika> sorry it was meant for somiaj
[09:43:51] <pikapika> other than different numbers in the sense of y+7k
[09:44:00] <pikapika> can inverses exist
[09:44:23] <tusko> So I can rewrite it as y = 7^-1 mod 9?
[09:44:26] <pikapika> (ie for 3y mod 7 = 1 as an example)
[09:44:38] <pikapika> 15 seems thef irst number that fits
[09:44:50] <pikapika> I mean 5
[09:44:58] <somiaj> pikapika: they are often considered unique, but the fine line is unique mod(n)
[09:45:08] <pikapika> 3*5=15, 15 mod 7 = 1
[09:45:11] <qergle> ok, the plug & chug (non-crt) method is x=3 (mod 7) -> x=7k+3 -> x=4 (mod 9) -> 7k+3=4 (mod 9) -> 7k=1 (mod 9) -> k = 4 (mod 9)
[09:45:15] <pikapika> somiaj, yeah thats what I meant

[09:45:40] <qergle> x=7*4+3=31
[09:46:12] <tusko> qergle, yes I think you are right, but how did 7k = 1 mod 9 become k = 4 mod 9?
[09:46:16] <qergle> in other words, once you find k (you called it y) you plug it back in to get x.
[09:47:01] <qergle> tusko: the algorithmic way is euclidean algo
[09:47:11] <qergle> but the modulus was small enough, i did it in my head, testing numbers

[09:47:26] <tusko> I can only imagine 7 = 7 mod 9 or 7 = -2 mod 9
[09:47:47] <pikapika> I need to study the NTT some time
[09:47:53] <qergle> you know it's not 1, since 7*1 = 7 (mod 9) and 14 isn't 1 (mod 9) etc
[09:48:16] <qergle> so 1,2 are out. 21 isn't 1 (mod 9), but 28 is (it's one more than a multiple of 9: 27)
[09:48:20] <qergle> so i got 4 rather quickly
[09:48:27] <tusko> So in your head you're calculating 7*1, 7*2, 7*3, ... looking for a number 1 mod 9?
[09:48:40] <qergle> looking for a number that's 1 more than a multiple of 9, yes.
[09:48:47] <tusko> oh, that's interesting
[09:49:00] *** Joins: bowlofeggs (~bowlofegg@fedora/bowlofeggs)
[09:49:23] <tusko> and so then that justifies k = 4 mod 9 because k = 4 + 9*?
[09:49:49] <qergle> because 7*4 = 28 and that's 1 more than 27 which is a multiple of 9.
[09:49:54] <qergle> so i know 28 = 1 (mod 9)

[09:52:04] <qergle> you want to solve 7k=1 (mod 9)
[09:52:35] <qergle> so you are looking for a k in [0,8] such that 7*k=1 (mod 9) and that is 4.
[09:52:55] <tusko> ohhh
[09:53:02] <qergle> it is guaranteed to exist because (7,9)=1 and it's unique.
[09:54:04] <tusko> and so x = 7k + 3 => 7(4) + 3 = 31
[09:54:09] <tusko> the unique solution
[09:54:21] <tusko> mod 9
[09:54:31] <tusko> no
[09:54:33] <tusko> mod 63
[09:54:51] <qergle> and you can test it
[09:55:21] <qergle> 31 leaves a remainder 3 on division by 7 and a remainder of 4 on division by 9.

[14:39:04] <int-e> you can get the same set of events for multiple intervals

[14:40:09] <int-e> Well, it depends on Omega. But it could be that, yes.
[14:40:45] <CuriousErnestBro> didn't you define omega as {1,2,3,4,5,6} just now?
[14:40:53] <int-e> No.
[14:41:03] <CuriousErnestBro> "Y is the result of a roll of a (fair) die"
[14:41:04] <int-e> That's just the outcomes of Y.
[14:41:16] <int-e> You can do that over much richer probability spaces.
[14:41:40] <CuriousErnestBro> What do you mean by "richer"?
[14:41:57] <CuriousErnestBro> can the die example have a different probability space?
[14:42:06] <CuriousErnestBro> well the set of outcomes is the same
[14:42:19] <int-e> Y could be: pick a uniformly random real number in [0,1) (so *that* is your probability space). Multiply it by 6, add 1, and truncate the result to an integer.

[15:10:13] <Franciman> they somehow render in a new way the old christian idea of one and three
[15:10:19] <int-e> The conjugate thing, on the other hand, explains pretty much everything.

[15:10:25] <int-e> Franciman: --> offtopic
[15:10:36] <Franciman> I was answering to CuriousErnestBro
[15:10:38] <Franciman> sorry
[15:10:58] <CuriousErnestBro> yeah I'm going to ask my prof to work through this example
[15:11:02] <cadmio> so that's not true only for (12) but for all permutations simga, tau that commute
[15:11:15] <CuriousErnestBro> so that I learn what sigma algebra's vs smallest sigma algebra's mean
[15:11:21] <CuriousErnestBro> and what it means to be measurable
[15:12:28] <int-e> There are some potential surprises... e.g. (1 2)(3 4)(5 6) commutes with (1 3 5)(2 4 6).
[15:12:54] <Franciman> CuriousErnestBro: unfortunately I can't answer more, because it seems I am offtopic
[15:13:00] <CuriousErnestBro> I see.
[15:13:19] <int-e> measurability would be on topic
[15:13:50] <Franciman> oh well then
[15:13:57] <Franciman> CuriousErnestBro: sigma algebra is problematic is it?
[15:14:06] <Franciman> I like to see it in this way
[15:14:16] <Franciman> suppose I can measure the whole space
[15:14:21] <Franciman> and one of its subsets
[15:14:30] <Franciman> can I measure the complemtary of this subset?
[15:14:46] <Franciman> (i.d expect measure(X - A) = measure(X) - measure(A) )
[15:14:47] <Franciman> lol
[15:15:36] <Franciman> the axioms defining when a set is a sigma-algebra
[15:15:47] <Franciman> hinge on the fact of how to build measurable sets from measurable ones

[18:29:30] <isekaijin> Instead, Zariski uses the inductive hypothesis as his first step: L = K(x1)[x2,...,xn] is algebraic over K(x1). And only then he shows that x1 is algebraic over K, thereby establishing that K(x1) = K[x1].
[18:31:50] <int-e> kobalt: my computer disagrees. Meanwhile I'm wondering why you even care about a case with an odd digit sum.
[18:32:52] <kobalt> sorry i mistyped, two odd and one even digit.
[18:33:52] <qergle> not 250?
[18:35:18] <int-e> qergle: funny, I'm getting 260
[18:35:28] <int-e> also I'm past doing these variations manually
[18:35:30] <qergle> i'm very confused on variants now
[18:35:49] <qergle> i get 300 (2 odd, 1 even, >= 10)
[18:35:55] <int-e> and is it > 10 rather than >= 10
[18:36:02] <riv> it could be solved with a computer program that just checks numbers
[18:36:05] <int-e> qergle: yes, that I agree with
[18:36:14] <Z-module> isekaijin: yeah, it's a very nice proof.
[18:36:14] <qergle> and 260 is you use >10
[18:36:21] <qergle> which is new (we'd been doing ≥ so far)

[18:49:52] <isekaijin> Damn, my Algebra test will have sequential questions. Once you move on to the next question, you cannot modify the answer to the previous one.
[18:50:10] <[itchyjunk]> sounds horrible
[18:50:15] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: There is a proof that pi is transcendental, which is an even stronger property than being irrational.
[18:50:31] <[itchyjunk]> i like moving around with problems
[18:50:48] <[itchyjunk]> oh i might have forgotten definitoins of irrational and transcendental
[18:50:57] <[itchyjunk]> transcendental just means non algebriac ?
[18:51:21] <isekaijin> Yes, and algebraic means that it is the solution of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients (not necessarily monic).
[18:51:31] <kobalt> i have heard somewhere that transcedental numbers are bad.
[18:51:39] <mornfall> if a decimal expansion of a number is finite, that number is in ℚ

[19:10:29] <[itchyjunk]> What do you call things that are almost rings but not quite?
[19:10:44] <[itchyjunk]> Googleling almost rings lead to some stuff that's called "almost ring" already
[19:10:47] <somiaj> [itchyjunk]: not quite in what way?
[19:10:52] <[itchyjunk]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_ring
[19:11:02] <[itchyjunk]> somiaj, as in some of the axioms are weaker or non existant
[19:11:21] <somiaj> but which ones? That could affect what people may call it
[19:11:22] <[itchyjunk]> maybe no requirement for associativity or existence of * identity element or somesuch
[19:11:32] <somiaj> for instance is the group of addition just a moniod instaed of a group?
[19:11:35] <[itchyjunk]> well i just want a list of them all
[19:12:05] <somiaj> well rings don't necessaraly require an idenity element for multiplication, though in many cases it is useful, so lots of places say consider a ring with identity
[19:12:06] <[itchyjunk]> just to see what kind of weakenings has been done and studied
[19:12:36] <[itchyjunk]> my courses and artin defined rings to have one
[19:12:51] <[itchyjunk]> but there must be a list of things that are almost rings but off by a little bit
[19:13:09] <somiaj> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring
[19:13:38] <[itchyjunk]> right thats one without inverse
[19:13:50] <somiaj> if you want to relax assicitivity, I think this gets into lie algebras
[19:14:06] <[itchyjunk]> i guess no one made a list of these
[19:14:10] <somiaj> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-associative_algebra
[19:14:14] <[itchyjunk]> apparently not for group either, minus this one picture
[19:14:15] <[itchyjunk]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(algebra)#/media/File:Magma_to_group4.svg
[19:14:45] <somiaj> Anyways, there are various things with weaker structure, but it depends on what you weaken for what it is called
[19:15:01] <[itchyjunk]> but there is no look up table to see them all?

[22:29:43] <somiaj> Julian: does coarser mean more or less edges?
[22:30:27] <Juliu> I mean like I could represent each cycle in the graph with a node and connect it to everything the cycle is connected to. That way you get a coarser version
[22:30:50] <Juliu> But this only seems to work for certain graphs, for example planar graphs maybe
[22:30:53] <somiaj> As your question states you just need to know the answer to my question, then you can either add or take away edges, that easy
[22:30:56] *** Quits: riv (~river@tilde.team/user/river) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:31:05] <somiaj> what is your definition of a coarser graph?
[22:31:13] <Juliu> If you do that for a graph that forms a tetraeder, you'll get a new tetraeder, so nothing coarser sadly
[22:31:56] <Juliu> I'd like a graph with less nodes where each node represents a set of nodes in the old graph. And the new node should of course be connected to everything the old nodes were connected to as well
[22:32:55] *** Joins: riv (~river@tilde.team/user/river)
[22:33:01] <somiaj> so maybe if you have a subgraph that is an equivalence relation, represent each equivalence class as a single node?
[22:34:00] <somiaj> so something like let G1 subgraph of G be an equivalence relation of maximal size, then turn all equivalence classes into a single node?
[22:34:24] <Juliu> I have a graph given and I'd like a coarser version of that graph
[22:35:14] <somiaj> Just making a graph coarser or finer is easy, just add/subtract edges. But it seems that you had additional conditions, so make those conditions clear.
[22:35:44] <Juliu> For example if the given graph is two cycles that are connected, then a coarser version could maybe be just to represent each cycle by a node and connect those 2 nodes with an edge
[22:36:06] <somiaj> My last comments were about your statement, "I'd like a graph...." and to me equivalence classes seemed natural for that
[22:36:13] <Juliu> I somehow want to get rid of cycles
[22:36:39] <Juliu> It's just a graph. Nothing with equivalance classes or stuff like that
[22:37:46] <somiaj> just getting rid of cycles maybe a bit more problematic which is why I suggested thinking of it as an equivalence relation. For instance if you had two cycles a->b->c->d->a and a->b->e->f->a how would you get rid of those two? Do you want those to be two distinct nodes in your new graph?
[22:39:01] <somiaj> I know it is just a graph, but all graphs can be viewed as relations on the nodes, and since they are already symmetric, you just need transitive to have an equivalence class, so to me it seemed to be a natural way to condense multiple nodes into a single node

[22:39:42] <somiaj> I guess they are actually antireflexive relations, but you could assume reflexivitivty for this.
[22:40:26] <somiaj> note cycles may not be transitive with all points in the node, so you are just thinking of a bit weaker version of what I was suggesting.
[22:40:59] <somiaj> but because cycles may not make all the points transitive, this leads to the example I pointed out above you'd have to decide what to do with it.

[22:43:46] <Juliu> somiaj, yes, I'd like 2 distinct nodes in the new graph for your example
[22:43:50] <Juliu> I think
[22:45:40] <somiaj> The problem with using cycles vs equivalence classes is deciding what the new nodes are going to be, but I think you do have a good idea of what you want, you just need to decide what to do about it
[22:46:01] <somiaj> but sounds like you want to turn each distinct cycle into a single node, and connect it to any node (not in the cycle) any node in the cycle is connected to
[22:46:10] <Juliu> I wonder if you do what I explained, represent each cycle in the old graph with a node in the new graph, and then repeat this iteratively, for what connected graphs does this result in a single node?
[22:47:47] <Juliu> somiaj, yes, indeed, that is what I meant. Or to be more precise, connect two new nodes in case one of the node they represent is connected with one of the nodes the other new node represents

[22:48:46] <somiaj> the other issue I see with doing this with cycles over equivalence classes is you will destroy some info about the graph, which you maybe okay with
[22:51:04] <Juliu> Of course a coarser graph contains less information, that's no problem :)
[22:54:13] <somiaj> yup, but if you knew what the equivalence classes were in the original graph + new graph in my original suggestion, you could rebuild the original graph.
[22:54:22] <Juliu> I want to know for what kind of connected graphs this procedure leads to a single node if you iterate it

[23:20:19] <Z-module> you should
