[01:32:00] <bpalmer> so, e.g., if you have void f(std::string s), which is a reasonable c++ function, you might want to provide an extern "C" { void exported_f(const char*p) { f(std::string(p)); } } which also handles going from a C type to a C++ type

[07:58:45] <parsnip> to be clear, i was still going to suggest -q

[14:37:46] <wasamasa> twb: because EU regulations
[14:38:39] <twb> wasamasa: I dunno about EU, but they're routine in South Asia
[14:39:17] <twb> wasamasa: but if you watch videos in Hindi they just say "cooker".  If you watch American videos, they often say "instant pot" instead of "pressure cooker"
[14:39:35] <ecraven> can't you get pressure cookers in europe fine too?
[14:40:16] <wasamasa> your options for big pressure cookers are limited
[14:40:27] <wasamasa> like, big enough to sterilize many jars of food
[14:40:45] <twb> instant pot is only about 10 or 15 litres I think
[14:40:55] <ecraven> ah, sorry, didn't read far enough back. we just have one of the "normal" ones for making potatoes and stuff
[14:41:00] <twb> home canning setups are usually much bigger

[20:28:46] <kenran> I managed to do it by appending something to my theme switching function. There I read the current cursor color by doing (face-background 'cursor). Now this works except for when I start emacs via `emacsclient -a '' --create-frame`. Then my normal cursor color is white, which means that the (face-background 'cursor) is wrong.
