[00:34:58] <Atsuko> question about subtitle tracks
[00:35:20] <Atsuko> if i have two tracks, one default with english subs for a japanese dialogue
[00:35:45] <Atsuko> and one forced that covers things like signs/nametags ect...
[00:35:58] <Atsuko> is there someway to merge them into 1 track
[00:36:17] <Atsuko> or if i have the default track selected the force track will also kick in when nessessary
[00:36:41] <kepstin> usually they're completely separate tracks, and the default one will include both dialog and sign translations
[00:38:06] <Atsuko> ahh i see

[01:05:50] <Pepe_vulgaris> hi guys, any idea what container format to use with alac?
[01:07:00] <Pepe_vulgaris> I'm trying to transcode an ogg(flac) stream from icecast into another icecast stream
[01:07:25] <Pepe_vulgaris> my first go-to format was ogg, but it can't seem to accept alac
[01:10:46] <Hello71> lol
[01:13:39] <kepstin> you'd normally put alac into mp4 container (specifically the "ipod" variant that you get with the 'm4a' extension)
[01:14:26] <kepstin> that's not a streamable container tho. i didn't even know you could use alac with icecast
[01:22:59] <Pepe_vulgaris> yeah, that was my second guess, and as it's not streamable, unsuitable for my purpose
[01:23:36] <Pepe_vulgaris> I tried ismv and mpegts, neither really works, but at least the transcoding starts
[01:24:19] <Pepe_vulgaris> Unsupported codec with id 100359 for input stream 0 is what I get when I try to ffprobe -i the other side of icecast
[01:25:04] <Pepe_vulgaris> ffmpeg does warn me about the audio being muxed as a private data stream
[01:25:10] <JEEB> ismv is an old crappy thing before fragmented mp4 was specified
[01:25:38] *** Joins: Nact (~l@host-85-27-122-107.dynamic.voo.be)
[01:25:44] <JEEB> if you want fragmented mp4 you want -f mp4 -movflags dash which enables fragmentation, plus probably min/max frag duration since all audio packets are "keyframes"
[01:26:54] <JEEB> yea, -frag_duration but heck if I see what the time base for that is :)
[01:27:10] <JEEB> that is, if icecast supports fragmented mp4 ingest :P
[01:27:52] <JEEB> ah, it is in AV_TIME_BASE_Q
[01:28:03] <JEEB> which is 1:1000000
[01:28:08] <JEEB> so 1 second is 1000000

[01:52:28] <Pepe_vulgaris> not for the cupertino brand folks
[01:53:05] <furq> yeah that's an even bigger problem
[01:53:23] <Pepe_vulgaris> on the other hand, there's already an nginx in front of icecast which does support hls iirc
[01:54:03] <furq> there's a plugin for it
[01:55:50] <furq> i have no idea if the nginx stuff supports alac though
[01:56:14] <furq> although all you really need is an httpd and then something that generates the fragments, and i guess ffmpeg can do that
[01:56:48] <Pepe_vulgaris> it should be agnostic, as long as it can make sense of the container format

[20:37:18] <JEEB> Flole: shouldn't be an error unless you specifically enable Werror
[20:37:33] <JEEB> also trusty is EOL since 2019 :)
[20:37:52] <JEEB> centos also sounds like old compiler. I would expect newer compilers to actually be *stricter*
[20:38:22] <JEEB> it's basically a readability warning, "you might want to add parenthesis around X | Y"
[20:39:11] <Flole> Yeah I know, so that's not a normal ffmpeg compile option?
[20:39:37] <Flole> Ah actually seems like -Werror=parentheses is set
[20:40:23] <JEEB> yes, we set some specific ones.
[20:40:29] <Flole> Ah look at 375 of the common.h
[20:40:31] <Flole> #if (!defined(__INTEL_COMPILER) && AV_GCC_VERSION_AT_LEAST(5,1)) || AV_HAS_BUILTIN(__builtin_add_overflow)

[20:41:45] <JEEB> for the record in master I can't see Werror=parenthesis
[20:41:52] <Flole> So I guess the others do fullfill that requirement, just trusty and centos aren't so they go into the #else
[20:42:02] <JEEB> yea trusty has 4.8 I think
[20:42:09] <JEEB> also centos actually should have newer toolchain available
[20:42:13] <JEEB> just like RHEL has
[20:42:29] <Flole> Shouldn't we just fix this and add those parantheses? Seems to be just that line ;D
[20:43:29] <JEEB> > if ((int64_t)(a^b | ~s^b) >= 0)
[20:44:12] <Flole> Yeah and I think it wants them like this: if ((int64_t)((a^b) | (~s^b)) >= 0)
[20:44:31] <JEEB> yea
[20:44:35] <kepstin> the ffmpeg 4.4 branch/tag isn't setting -Werror=parenthesis either tho
[20:44:41] <JEEB> yea
[20:45:22] <JEEB> so while it might be more readalbe to have the ^ stuff in parenthesis
[20:45:25] <JEEB> it should not fail at that
[20:46:07] <Flole> It's not more readable either :D
[20:46:13] <Flole> Just makes it more complicated
[20:46:29] <JEEB> but yea, check what sets that Werror for you
[20:46:45] <JEEB> we specifically seem to be in one configure check disabling parenthesis warnings o_O

[20:46:58] <JEEB> > check_disable_warning -Wno-parentheses
[20:48:09] <Flole> Uhm, if I set -Wall does it stills say [-Werror=parentheses]?
[20:48:50] <kepstin> by default, ffmpeg only sets specific -Werror= categories
[20:48:59] <kepstin> you're not setting -Werror=all or anything like that, right? :)
[20:49:09] <kepstin> (or just -Werror, i think)
[20:49:27] <Flole> -Werror could be set
[20:49:28] <JEEB> yea all of those that FFmpeg sets can be found in the configure script
[20:49:37] <JEEB> everything else would then probably come from user
[20:49:45] <Flole> I am not sure though as this is another makefile calling the ffmpeg makefile
[20:50:20] <Flole> It was working fine before I bumped ffmpeg to 4.4
[20:51:32] <Flole> Hm yeah that code was changed from 4.3 to 4.4 and the code with the missing parentheses was added
[20:54:27] <JEEB> in any case, it *really* feels like your build system is adding that flag
[20:54:32] <JEEB> so check that out

[21:00:37] <JEEB> also for the record, I am *very* happy I no longer have to care about trusty
[21:01:10] <JEEB> like, you had to know of and install a vlc gnutls lib to actually make modern TLS work at the end
[21:01:39] <JEEB> also the toolchain you definitely wanted to upgrade to one of those newer ones
[21:01:59] <JEEB> since while gcc 4.8 might work for FFmpeg, various deps definitely have boogs with it

[21:18:05] <Flole> Looked like I did indeed specify -Werror in another Makefile and that made it into the ffmpeg Makefile
[21:20:11] <JEEB> Werror can be useful, but it really depends on the compiler version and code what it ends up barfing about.
[21:23:03] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[21:23:17] <kepstin> (as a person who has done distro packaging, we have to patch projects to remove -Werror every now and then as compilers add new warnings over time…)
[21:23:53] <kepstin> the specific small number of settings enabled by ffmpeg hasn't caused any problems as far as I've seen, tho
[21:24:27] *** Quits: finsternis (~X@23.226.237.192) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:27:47] <Flole> I just disabled werror now for trusty and centos, trusty already went through and centos hasn't run yet. I still think those parentheses should be added, do I need to propose this patch properly to the mailing list then or is there any other, easier way for such small changes?
[21:31:20] <JEEB> kepstin: yea as they get a specific name and are considered useful, they generally do the same thing between versions
[21:31:38] <JEEB> Flole: if we were setting that Werror, we'd do something about it to be honest :P but we don't
[21:32:21] <JEEB> but in general yes, patches go to the mailing list
[21:32:55] <Flole> Okay I'm not going to annoy everyone for 2 sets of parentheses :D Thanks for your help!
