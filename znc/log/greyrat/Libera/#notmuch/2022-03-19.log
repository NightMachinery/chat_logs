[07:44:45] <seanw> Hm, looks like if I index List-Id using 'notmuch config set index.header.List List-Id' then there isn't a way to search for "has no List-Id"
[07:44:50] <seanw> right?

[19:44:14] <seanw> bremner: oh ho
[19:48:27] <seanw> bremner: hmm, it includes lots of List results afaict.
[19:48:40] <seanw> I did: notmuch search \(not \(List \*\)\)
[19:51:44] <seanw> I'm gonna reindex just to be sure, but I am pretty confident my List custom thing is working
[19:56:16] <seanw> yeah, problem remains.
[20:01:17] <seanw> It's very weird.  That query (from Emacs this time) doesn't seem to have any relation to whether messages have a List-Id.  In fact I can't see any pattern between what messages it selects and which it doesn't, e.g. within one Emacs bug report here it selects some but not all messages.
[20:03:53] *** Joins: nlhowell (~nlhowell@172.58.87.84)
[20:10:55] <bremner> seanw: you need to specify --query=sexp if you want the sexp query parser
[20:11:40] <bremner> personally I would use quoting rather than escape everything, but you can check the results with NOTMUCH_DEBUG_QUERY=t in the environment
[20:12:36] <seanw> ah, thank you, that works

[20:19:20] <bremner> seanw: correct. Although I just posted a patch to allow embedding sexp queries in infix ones via sexp:
[20:21:05] <seanw> e.g. sexp:(not (List *)) and foo and bar can be typed into Emacs thanks to that patch?
[20:21:22] <bremner> up to quoting, yeah
[20:21:40] <seanw> well that is the only sexp query I need...
[20:22:08] <bremner> so far :)
[20:22:17] <seanw> well it would allow me to dump my sieve script.
[20:22:45] <seanw> currently the fact I can't distinguish between List-Id being present or not means I have to use folder:inbox/folder:lists in all my saved searches, and a sieve script to split mail between those
[20:23:20] <seanw> thanks for the updates.  I guess I will make a note that I can implement this when notmuch 0.36 comes out.
[20:41:15] <seanw> bremner: 'notmuch config set squery.Lists "(List *)"' and now I can do "List and foo or bar" from Emacs!
[20:41:31] <seanw> "Lists and foo and bar" *
[20:44:30] <seanw> ah no, it seems query:Lists can't refer to a sexp query from an infix query.
[20:54:30] <bremner> yeah, I think you'd still need the sexp: patch, so sexp:(Lists)
[21:07:15] <seanw> bremner: I'm tempted to backport, given how much this could simplify my usage.  probably not a release until late april?
[21:09:21] <bremner> yeah, that sounds about right.
