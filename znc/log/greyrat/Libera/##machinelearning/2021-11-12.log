[21:47:47] <FeedBot> [13Fb:Research] Cross-Domain Imitation Learning via Optimal Transport: We propose Gromov-Wasserstein Imitation Learning (GWIL), a method for cross-domain imitation that uses the Gromov-Wasserstein distance to align and compare states between the different spaces of the agents. Our theory formally characterizes the scenarios where GWIL preserves optimality, revealing its possibilities and limitations. → https://j.mp/3oqbRIN
