[00:46:19] <alkisg> But some DEs come on their own without desktop environments to accompany them
[00:46:20] <themachine> if floating is more your thing though then Openbox is solid.
[00:46:37] <akk> +1 for openbox
[00:46:51] <uwharrie> right, a WM is one of the applications a DE is going to attempt to "standardize" on
[00:47:03] <jfcaron> I think I once tried a tiling WM but I got super lost.
[00:47:08] <alkisg> A window manager is what places the windows around the screen, while a desktop environment is also a file manager, a notepad, a control panel, a panel/menu etc etc

[01:43:46] <Tony80> BCMM An extremely good point! Extremely likely!

[01:44:16] <Tony80> it's slowly coming back to me - it's been about 5 years!
[01:44:37] <BCMM> Tony80: "fast startup" is enabled by default. it means that, when you press "shut down", what windows actually does is more like "log out and then hibernate"
[01:44:44] <Tony80> Essentially, I **think** you can't do it with it enables
[01:44:57] <BCMM> this means that the c:\ drive is not actually unmounted

So I have shrunk my Windows partition as it didn't seem that I could specify how much hard drive space I wanted dedicated to Linux. I have created some extra space (somewhere in the region of 255gb) which is currently just "free space". From there, I am thoroughly confused with the install process.

[03:57:11] <jim> Tony80, you need a partition for /; I also recommend a partition for /home, one for swap space, at the very least

[03:58:34] <matsaman> they're nice to have, but yeah, you can use a file
[03:58:46] <matsaman> you can do a lot with a swap partition

[03:59:29] <jim> Tony80, how much space is available for linux?

[04:00:07] <Tony80> mb*
[04:00:09] <matsaman> Tony80: you just need a partition for root (/) and a swap partition or a swap file on the aforementioned partition
[04:00:11] <BCMM> matsaman: a swapfile is more flexible, and has effectively the same performance on modern kernels
[04:00:19] <matsaman> BCMM: it's not, though
[04:00:24] <jim> so 250 gb?

[04:31:07] <jim> Tony80, I would probably put the boot loader on the same partition you're reserving for /
[04:31:23] <BCMM> no. on an efi system, the bootloader is just a file that needs to be installed in the ESP
[04:31:25] <jim> (in this case :)

[04:34:54] <Dagmar> For UEFI there's only _one_ place grub goes

[16:55:35] <Amadiro> Masklin_Gurder, sure, depends on how you want to stress test it though

[16:56:23] <Masklin_Gurder> euouae: What's that?
[16:56:41] <Amadiro> If your particular benchmark does not work headless, you might need to spin up an X server before you can run it
[16:56:42] <euouae> a theoretical binary that stresses the gpu of the server
[16:56:56] <Masklin_Gurder> -_-
[16:57:11] <euouae> well pretty much that's more or less what you can do Masklin_Gurder...
[16:57:21] <Masklin_Gurder> Amadiro: Wouldn't that stress-test the local gpu?
[16:57:27] <Masklin_Gurder> Hmm maybe not...
[16:57:47] <Masklin_Gurder> I guess the connection just sends the results of the calculations
[16:57:51] <Amadiro> Masklin_Gurder, you wouldn't forward the x-session to your local machine in that case
[16:58:00] <Amadiro> But just let the benchmark run on the remote X session
[16:58:11] <Masklin_Gurder> I'm not sure I know what you mean
[16:58:30] <Masklin_Gurder> When people talk of X11, all I know is you use it to have GUIs on your local screen from a remote machine.
[16:58:33] <Amadiro> There's plenty of games too that have a commandline switch like --run-benchmark or similar, so you can start a game from your steam library for instance and make it run as benchmark.

For benchmarking gameplay-performance, this would be a good idea
[16:59:54] <Amadiro> if you're more interested in server applications, you'd probably run a headless benchmark like some scientific CUDA benchmark or similar

[20:44:56] <peetaur> and FYI the reason it looks overly complicated is that I found you really had to cause memory pressure for a while before you can allocate more, repeat, etc. before you really wasted all the RAM. If you just allocate it all once, some stuff gets freed up and you don't get any oom killing. But of course oom killing isn't what you want ...so you'll have to redefine what you want in the end.

[23:06:10] <jim> short blerb on the pieces of lvm and how they work together...
[23:06:15] <jim> with partitions, you make partitions using a partition tool, format them with a filesystem directly, and mount the partition with the filesystem. with LVM, instead of putting filesystems in partitions directly, you put 'LVM physical volumes' in partitions, then you make a 'volume group' (which is just a list of physical volumes), and put physical volumes in the volume groups, then you can make 'logical volumes', and these are what you would format and
[23:06:15] <jim> mount, and they got allocated from a volume group.
[23:06:20] <paulcarroty> so lvm+btrfs looks like abstraction-abstraction-volume
