[03:44:58] <KirkMcDonald> Note that there is an important difference in these operations: One reverses in-place, and the other makes a new list.
[03:45:00] <stewie925> so reverse() is more efficient
[03:45:18] <SnoopJ> stewie925, they don't do the same thing, as KirkMcDonald points out
[03:45:30] <SnoopJ> reverse() *changes* the list, slicing creates a new list (which is why it is slower: it has more work to do)
[03:45:36] <KirkMcDonald> reverse() takes less time because it is doing less; it does not need to allocate a copy.
[03:45:59] <stewie925> thank you gentlemen
[03:46:06] <KirkMcDonald> But: I do suspect doing this mathematically would be faster than either.

[04:06:21] <bjs> stewie925: to clarify KirkMcDonald's point, divmod's with powers of 10 can "split" a number up:  divmod(123456789, 10**4) gives you (12345, 6789)

[05:18:35] <ldericher> You should switch the order around to be sure
[05:18:50] <ldericher> like run _index first, then _pop or w/e
[05:18:57] <stewie925> ok, I can do that :)
[05:19:08] <hypoon> BtbN: I don't disagree. Is there a way to write a package for setuptools that doesn't depend on a nested package manager?
[05:19:27] <ldericher> again: without more context, should I prefer a map() call, or a generator/list comprehension?

[05:19:51] <KirkMcDonald> I would default to preferring comprehensions.

[05:23:55] <BtbN> I doubt bootstraping setuptools is impossible, would be a weird chicken&egg problem
[05:24:46] <hypoon> BtbN: Gentoo calls setup.py and doesn't get the error that I get. I don't know why.

[05:25:07] <ffledgling> I have a simple question that seems to be stumping me - what's the correct way to specify the sort function for a tuple which has (Priority: Enum, deadline: int). The tuples should be sorted in order of descending priority, but ascending deadline (i.e high priority, closest deadline first). I'm looking at the Python Sorting HOWTO and it mentions that I can rely on the stable sort behaviour and then simply chain sorts to get what I want...
[05:25:07] <ffledgling>  but I don't understand how this works?
[05:25:36] <ffledgling> ref: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sort-stability-and-complex-sorts
[05:26:22] <grym> sorted(thetuples, key=lamda x: x[0])  (or x.Priority, if this is a namedtuple)

[05:27:27] <stewie925> ldericher, yes in all cases, switching the order of the function calls always show the rindex is the fastest :D

[05:29:12] <stewie925> thanks so much ldericher
[05:29:23] <ffledgling> grym: That will simply sort based on priority. I need a complex sort where the ordering is Priority (descending) and deadline (ascending). The howto says I can do this with sorted(tuples, key=x[0]), followed by a sorted(tuples, key=x[1]). Wouldn't the sorting based on [0] get shuffled around with the second sort based on [1] ?
[05:30:49] <grym> ffledgling: oh.  then you can either sort twice, or write a more complicated function for the key

[10:18:44] <powftw> can i get rid of double slash while showing it to frontend? i wanted to pass it to my html file where it shows double slash
[10:19:20] <powftw> if i only return a single string, it shows without double slash, when we return a dict, it shows double slash
[10:19:56] <KirkMcDonald> If you want to format the dict in some other way, then you'll need to do that yourself.

[10:22:24] <powftw> exactly

[10:23:59] <grawity> so dicts can't really *exist* in HTML, they have to be stringified in some way... and when you just ask python to show a dict as a string, it always gives you the same kind of output as you'd use for input
[10:24:20] <grawity> if you define a dict like {"value": "\\something"}, it's completely normal that it'll be printed the same way
[10:24:21] <KirkMcDonald> Stringify the dict. Serialize the dict.

[11:52:08] <TML> You'll see there are _3_ characters in this string: the letter "a", the letter "b", and between them, a single "reverse solidus" character "\"
[11:52:59] <TML> But because \ is _also_ used to escape strings, when we mean a literal \, we have to write two of them, so the parser can understand we mean "<a><reverse-solidus><b>" and not "<a><escape-character-b>"
[11:54:10] <TML> powftw: In the same way, the string "s\tu" means the _3_ character sequence "<s><escaped-tab-character><u>", not the _4_ character sequence "<s><reverse solidus><t><u>"
[11:54:26] <TML> If we want the latter, we have to say "s\\tu"
[11:54:57] *** Joins: EvilDMP (~textual@django/moderator/EvilDMP)
[11:55:01] <TML> And if we want to pass that same state on to JSON, depending on how we do it, we may even have to say "s\\\\tu"
[11:55:50] <TML> (Python's parser eats "\\\\" down to "<reverse-solidus><reverse-solidus>" - or "\\", and JSON eats "\\" down to "<reverse-solidus>")
[11:56:21] <TML> but again, far far better to stop using <reverse-solidus> as an escape/special character in your logic
[11:56:41] <TML> it's a terrible decision for all these reasons, plus many we haven't even begun to touch on

[13:58:25] <pyzozord> hmm, how about using sorted?
[13:58:37] <logithack> Timvde: Yes, I've read about the preservation of insertion order having become a feature in 3.7. However, I've just fiddled around a bit and upon tens of thousands of dictionary creations, the entries always were of the same order.

[14:04:56] <The-Compiler> Zweimer: There's normally a proper solution for the problem; and this is global state which can break things in subtle ways - consider how things would fall apart if multiple libraries you are using messed with sys.path

[14:05:37] <deniska> Zweimer: fun one is having one module imported multiple times as distinct module objects
[14:06:35] <deniska> so far the only "real life" usecase I had for sys.path.append is running a wsgi app inside a… strange wsgi server
[14:06:36] <Timvde> aniketgm: So that confirms what I said, right?
[14:07:13] <jinsun> another one is  doing sys.path.insert and expecting file.py to be imported, but that doesn't happen because you imported file.py from another location before sys.path changed
[14:07:21] <aniketgm> yes, but more like 'absolutely' rather than 'sort of'
[14:07:27] <lxer> Is it OK to use @classmethods when these methods are only used internally in the class? I mean, is that 'code smell', or is it sometimes acceptable?
[14:07:34] <Timvde> aniketgm: "absolutely" starting from 3.7, but the question was about 3.6
[14:08:27] <jinsun> lxer: it is acceptable, just start the name of the function with underscore if it is internal
[14:08:43] <deniska> lxer: does it have to be a classmethod, or can it just be a free standing function?
[14:08:55] <deniska> (i.e. does it use `cls` parameter?)
[14:09:03] <Zweimer> Maybe I was asking the wrong question: I am using importlib to import a certain file (using an absolute path). This file however imports other modules and scripts inside the directory and also subdirectories. A simple exec_module on the certain file results therefore in a ImportError. I thought of adding the whole directories and subdirectories to

[17:17:01] <novasenco> if I do r = range(10) and use r in multiple loops (for i in r: for j in r: ... eg) it works. If I do r = ((i,j) for i in range(10) for j in range(10)) and use in multiple (separate) loops like  while not converged: for i,j in r: ...bla... it only goes through one iteration and then the iterable stops. Are ranges, in fact, different, from generators? I guess so, huh...? Damn that took me an hour to

[17:18:32] *** Joins: bloody (~bloody@user/bloody)
[17:19:25] <bjs> afidegnum: which part?  if you want to use `d` outside the loop you need to make sure that (1) d exists at all, that is, there were children and (2) that it is not None (because then it won't have an .id)
[17:19:29] <grym> i had no idea range was reusable
[17:19:44] <novasenco> is it bad? should I just not do that?
[17:20:03] <deniska> I sometimes reuse ranges
[17:20:05] <novasenco> I don't really care. I thought it might speed up the loop a tiny bit bc wouldn't have to create object over and over
[17:20:14] <novasenco> it's in a very computationally heavy loop
[17:20:25] <deniska> also I sometimes do `a = range(x, y)` and then `if z in a:…`
[17:20:50] *** Joins: BSaboia (~bsaboia@187.18.140.125)
[17:21:15] <deniska> novasenco: iterating over things in python is already relatively "heavy", creating or not some simple object won't make much difference
[17:21:51] <novasenco> I was thinking that, too. oh whale.
[17:21:56] <powftw> i'll ask this way. i've a flask app, which returns a json object, frontend uses fetch to fetch the json object, it a function i call foo() and it also returns the json. Now, after i recieve the json object, how i'm i able to display it in my html?<h1>  {{ foo().MYNAME }} </h1>  <-- this is not correct. But i'm asking..
[17:22:37] <novasenco> lmfao. for this assignment, we needed to use multiprocessing just for proof of concept, but it is so much slower than just doing it in parallel for obvious reasons. It's kind of funny.
[17:22:47] <aniketgm> powftw: void is fine. but better to loop it otu first.
[17:23:07] <afidegnum> bjs this implementation is also not successful https://dpaste.org/JcY6#L11
[17:23:33] <novasenco> whoops. I was accidentally copying a numpy array over and over.. that's what was so slow
[17:23:44] <aniketgm> oh so it's a flask app. i missed your earlier chat. Check out Miguels tutorial. he has some pointer on how to deal with this.

[20:50:11] <bjs> afidegnum: I'm not sure, I can't see what you're seeing so I can't tell
[20:50:21] <SnoopJ> okay, I guess they haven't fixed the issue themselves, then. yea, I'd try a newer Python

[20:50:33] <SnoopJ> good to know
[20:50:50] <SnoopJ> you may not have to come that far into the future judging by people reporting success with 3.7, 3.8, but 3.9 is nice :)

[22:08:45] <gambl0re> what is the iter method actually doing
[22:08:45] <SnoopJ> gambl0re, please don't paste in the channel, use https://bpa.st/+python
[22:08:55] <gambl0re> from my understanding...
[22:09:06] <gambl0re> the iter is a special python method that creates a generator
[22:09:09] <SnoopJ> __iter__ returns an iterator for the object: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iter__
[22:09:17] <gambl0re> which creates an iterable object
[22:09:49] <gambl0re> the yield statement acts similar to a return statement which returns the value and adds it to the generator
[22:09:52] <gambl0re> is that correct?
[22:10:58] *** Joins: sandb0y (~pirate@user/sandb0y)

[22:15:06] <SnoopJ> pycode1, if the locale is currently configured, I think you can do: `locale._override_localeconv = {**locale.localeconv(), "frac_digits": 0}; locale.currency(...)` but you may have to mess around with it a bit.

[22:17:37] * SnoopJ isn't sure if there are locales that group currency differently than arbitrary numbers, but suspects there are
[22:17:46] <pycode1> Wooble, yes exactly i need INT but i need to separate thousands
[22:18:05] <pycode1> Wooble, i try

[22:19:37] <SnoopJ> you could also look at localeconv()["decimal_point"] and strip off the part you don't care about, but I'm not crazy about that idea
[22:19:41] <pycode1> >>> locale.format("%d", 1000000, grouping=True)
[22:19:41] <pycode1> '1000000'
[22:20:03] <Wooble> pycode1: then your locale isn't set to something with separators
[22:20:17] <SnoopJ> or is a locale where LC_NUMERIC and LC_MONETARY are grouped differently
[22:20:43] <SnoopJ> pycode1, try adding monetary=True
[22:21:00] <pycode1> >>> locale.format("%d", 1000000, grouping=True, monetary=True)
[22:21:00] <pycode1> '1000000'
[22:21:08] <SnoopJ> welp
[22:21:35] <Wooble> does locale.currency() actually use the right separators right now?

[22:23:35] <Wooble> formatted_thing.partition(YOUR_DECIMAL_SEP)[0]?
[22:24:08] <SnoopJ> yea, ^ that is not a bad way to go if you can't make it work with format_string(), although I agree with Wooble, it sounds like maybe your locale was messed up in the most recent test
[22:24:30] <pycode1> wait wait
[22:24:31] <pycode1> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'it_IT.utf8') <---
[22:24:35] <pycode1> i added this and now
[22:24:36] <pycode1> it works
[22:24:40] <SnoopJ> which "it"
[22:24:45] <pycode1> >>> locale.format("%d", 10000000, grouping=True)
[22:24:45] <pycode1> '10.000.000'
[22:24:55] <pycode1> SnoopJ, ? is not correct?
[22:24:58] <SnoopJ> pycode1, if this is a currency I would still recommend setting monetary=True
[22:25:07] <SnoopJ> otherwise it's going to use LC_NUMERIC which might be wrong in some cases
[22:25:07] <Wooble> definitely suspicious if monetary=True wasn't using the same seps as currency() to begin with.

[22:26:53] <SnoopJ> pycode1, I have not said the word "switch" in this conversation, I don't understand your question. If you are working with monetary values, you should set monetary=True in your format_string() call.

[22:33:04] <bjs> novasenco: what is "it" ?
[22:34:07] <bjs> how much multiprocessing speeds up or slows down your program entirely depends on what your program is doing, how it was doing it and how you're using multiprocessing

[23:48:14] <Daemonick> What is the starting date of the seed for the python random number generator that reaches the current one in milliseconds
[23:48:33] <bjs> Daemonick: it just uses the current date
[23:48:46] <Daemonick> From when?
[23:48:47] <bjs> that's why if you restart your program you get different random numbers

[23:48:57] <bjs> Daemonick: what do you mean?
[23:48:58] <jwhisnant> Daemonick: you can also set it programatically
[23:49:15] <Daemonick> seed must be an enormous number in digits
[23:49:28] <philipp64> Hi. I'm still figuring out the landscape of modules for Python, and here's a question I've not been able to figure out... Is there a module for generating various well-known integer sequences, power series, etc?  A particular problem I'm working on requires computing complexity... and uses A001700 (https://oeis.org/A001700) but I suspect other series will be coming up soon... What's out there?  Thanks
[23:49:35] <Daemonick> Other P/Ls use UNIX epoch
[23:49:46] <bjs> Daemonick: yes,  it'll be the unix epoch
[23:49:56] <bjs> which is a large but not very big number

[23:51:14] <bjs> Daemonick: well, the random module will try proper randomness sources first (urandom), if they're available
[23:51:41] <philipp64> Daemonick: why not use /dev/urandom or a wrapper for it, like Openssl's random_bytes()?

[23:52:23] <Daemonick> Sorry guys but I am a newbie in python with lack of advanced knowlegde
[23:52:47] <bjs> Daemonick: let me try another approach then,  what do you want this information fo?
[23:52:49] <bjs> for*
[23:53:15] <Daemonick> For my own engine in a lottery game
[23:53:39] <bjs> Daemonick: and you want to use the default seed rather than your own?
[23:54:19] <Daemonick> yeap
[23:54:26] <jwhisnant> philipp64: that page seems to shows a python implementation and a citation  ...
[23:55:04] <jwhisnant> (its less than 10 lines) in the PROG section
