[00:12:30] <mhmd> yes, I'm thinking of the website as something closer to a blog, rather than a resource, elixirschool would be a better place as a resource, it's very comprehensive, and anyone can help

[00:36:33] <sepow> Ah fair enough. Well I guess both are good for seo
[00:37:47] <rawtaz> mhmd: are you creating a website with either of those two domain names?
[00:37:57] <rawtaz> if yes i have relevant input
[00:38:20] <mhmd> rawtaz: yes
[00:38:32] <mhmd> if it's ok?
[00:39:51] <rawtaz> sure
[00:39:55] <mhmd> Although for now I'm just registering the domain, I'll have to work on it in my free time
[00:40:38] <rawtaz> my thoughts are that the former sounds more like a resource or collection of articles, whereas the latter sounds more like something the visitors would follow, more like if you were to describe and write about your journey actually programming with elixir
[00:40:56] <rawtaz> in other words, the latter is a "follow along" type of name, the former is more of a resource collection name
[00:41:08] <sepow> mhmd: https://elixir-lang.org/trademarks

[00:49:03] <mhmd> as long as I'm not claiming that the website is related to the book, it should be fine, right?
[00:53:41] <sepow> If it's all in Persian or whatever I doubt anybody would care, but you could always write Dave Thomas on twitter or where ever he hangs out and ask I guess
[00:54:20] <sepow> I'd just start creating content before thinking about this, that's the hard part

[13:22:57] <serafeim> i don't know much erlang but after you know elixir erlang is a piece of cake.
[13:23:11] <serafeim> actually elixir is *thin* layer over erlang
[13:23:16] <serafeim> very thin actually
[13:23:33] <serafeim> so if you know elixir then you definitely know erlang

[13:24:45] *** Quits: fwg (~fwg@user/fwg) (Quit: .oO( zzZzZzz ...)
[13:24:58] <serafeim> i mean I've understood that elixir has taken inspirations from two languages
[13:25:07] <serafeim> one good (erlang) and one very bad (ruby)
[13:25:33] <nox> josevalim should make a series of streams where he changes Elixir's compiler to produce Core Erlang code instead of Erlang code, now that would be cool :p
[13:25:47] <serafeim> if elixir wouldn't have taken that ruby (and phoenix from ror) inspiration it would have been the greatest thing
[13:26:14] <serafeim> but you can't have it all i guess
[13:30:23] <nox> AFAIK the only stuff inspired from Ruby for Elixir is syntax
[13:30:31] <nox> and syntax is not that important in the end
[13:31:27] <serafeim> hmmm well ok but phoenix was inspired by the ror
[13:32:20] <serafeim> think how better would phoenix be if it was inspired from django
[13:33:26] <Nicd> or worse :D

[14:21:10] <v0idpwn> nox: elixir doesn't produce erlang, it produces erlang bytecode.
[14:21:36] <nox> v0idpwn: …because it produces Erlang code and then uses the Erlang compiler on it
[14:21:42] <v0idpwn> no, it doesn't

[14:24:50] <v0idpwn> i think you're being more flexible in what you call "erlang"
[14:25:16] <v0idpwn> (which doesn't mean you're wrong)
[14:25:21] <nox> You are though
[14:25:43] <nox> It produces Erlang forms that it feeds to the Erlang compiler, and it certainly does not produce Erlang bytecode directly.
[14:26:59] <nox> Mentioning Erlang bytecode is at the very least nonsensical when I was talking about targetting Core Erlang instead of Erlang.

[15:40:28] <serafeim> any idea why the `console.log("FOO")` is not run ? 
[15:40:47] <Nicd> do you have an element that has the Tick hook?
[15:40:59] <serafeim> how can i add that ?
[15:41:09] <Nicd> read the hook documentatoin
[15:41:27] <serafeim> why this must be so compicated ?
[15:43:07] <Nicd> maybe you can imagine how it should work in your opinion and then write a library that does that
[15:43:14] <serafeim> lol
[15:43:24] <serafeim> i just want to execute a function 
[15:43:38] <serafeim> why i need to pray to the dark gods to do that
[15:44:06] <Nicd> a function that does what?
[15:44:44] <Nicd> the only prayer you should say is to wish for the energy to read the documentation
[15:47:05] <serafeim> ha ha ha ha
[15:50:10] <serafeim> i fixed it
[15:50:21] <serafeim> i had to put this on an element: <div id='board' class='board' phx-update="append" phx-hook="Tick" >
[15:52:15] <Nicd> exactly
[15:52:25] <Nicd> preferably the element the hook is related to
[15:52:38] <serafeim> yes ok this isn't related to an element
[15:52:46] <serafeim> that's i guess my problem
[15:53:02] <serafeim> i hope i will remember that till next time :|
[15:53:25] <Nicd> then I'd put it on the rootmost element of the LV. dunno if you can put it on <body> with the default setup
[15:54:10] <serafeim> i don't have a body on that page it's on root.html.heex
[15:59:13] <serafeim> on every tick i'm seeing this on my js console: `phx-FsBQGGlXXlmTwgFB update:  -  Object` 
[15:59:17] <serafeim> is there a way to not see it ?
[15:59:33] <serafeim> oh
[15:59:40] <serafeim> could this be because i've got: `liveSocket.enableDebug()`
[15:59:46] <Nicd> yes
[15:59:50] <serafeim> ok thank you
[16:14:56] <serafeim> i was also able to fix the down key handlers

[17:04:24] <Nicd> the clock element can have a hook that hides it 200ms after mounted(). using innerHTML like that will be a pain to maintain
[17:08:29] <hmans> Hi, anyone here happen to build something with Unity that talks to Phoenix Channels? There are two Phoenix Channels client implementations out there (only one of which I can actually still find, <https://github.com/Mazyod/PhoenixSharp>), but neither has been updated in years.
[17:09:53] <hmans> I'm assuming the Phoenix Channels internals aren't terribly complicated, so if everything else fails, I would probably just try and whip up my own implementation. Just checking if anyone is already active in this space. :S

[19:16:22] <hoppity> Hi guys, I am trying to setup a navigation bar that shows the user at a glance what path he/she is at in my Phoenix app. Is there a recommended way to achieve this?

[22:02:28] <hoppity> Ankhers: I have, but always though it was just a way of displaying the information to the user. Is it something more?
[22:02:51] <hoppity> I guess my question is *how* does one implement breadcrums in Phoenix.
[22:03:23] <Ankhers> Yeah, that is just about display. Is there something more that you need?

[23:13:55] <hoppity> Ankhers: How to "know" what to present in the breadcrump. I know Phoenix has some functions to check the current path but the problem is that some views are live and some views are "regular" views in my app and I'm not sure how to *for sure* know the current path regardless of the kind of view.
