[01:06:23] <nedbat> i'm having to move a site to a new hosting provider, and I'm a php configuration newb.  Is this channel right for questions about .htaccess/php.ini/etc?
[01:07:49] <Blondie101010> .htaccess is a Apache httpd configuration file, so no, but php.ini is a PHP configuration file so yes
[01:08:12] <Blondie101010> you should just ask your specific quesiton
[01:09:03] <nedbat> Blondie101010: on my old host, phpinfo() shows: "Scan this dir for additional .ini files: /home/nedbat/webapps/main"  my new host shows "/etc/php74/conf.d" for that value.  How can I affect that setting?
[01:09:46] <Blondie101010> if you don't control the host, which seems to be the case, you don't change that, you just use the information to put your own configs in the right plac3e
[01:10:43] <Blondie101010> do you have write access to /etc/php74/conf.d ?
[01:11:39] <nedbat> Blondie101010: no
[01:12:14] <nedbat> I tried setting user_ini.filename in my .htaccess, but it had no effect.
[01:12:17] <Blondie101010> then you may not be able to change any PHP config, but that depends on the host.... some have ways to do it in their control panel
[01:12:30] <nedbat> Blondie101010: i'll check the panel
[01:12:37] <Blondie101010> I don't get your previous line
[01:12:50] <Blondie101010> "user_ini.filename in my .htaccess"
[01:13:54] <nedbat> Blondie101010: aiui, user_ini.filename is a PHP setting for a filename to look for alongside .php files being served.  I thought I could set it to pick up my local php.ini
[01:16:28] <Blondie101010> depending on the webserver config, you could be allowed to pass some php ini directives through .htaccess: https://davidwalsh.name/php-values-htaccess
[01:18:58] <Blondie101010> if you do that and get a 5xx http response, then you either made a mistake or did something that is not allowed
[01:23:03] <nedbat> Blondie101010: thanks, i'll keep working at it
[01:26:13] <Blondie101010> np
[01:34:14] *** Quits: freeworld (~cracker@chello085216193138.chello.sk) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[01:52:20] <__adrian> nedbat: note that passing php ini settings in your htaccess file is not a php feature, it's an apache feature (of very questionable value)
[01:52:34] <nedbat> __adrian: right, I understand
[01:53:16] <nedbat> I have a ~/.php/7.4/phprc file that I can put settings in, but I would like to get a php.ini file in my site's directory to be read.
[01:53:20] *** Quits: genom (~g@37.214.25.247) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:53:51] <__adrian> that would be a question for your host
[01:54:05] <__adrian> (and it's an approach i would not recommend)
[01:54:18] <__adrian> (but depending on your host... options may be limited)
[01:54:27] <Blondie101010> but that config file could perhaps allow to specify another include directory
[01:54:34] <__adrian> maybe
[01:55:25] <nedbat> __adrian: sorry, what is an approach you would not recommend?
[01:55:44] <__adrian> trying to put ini settings anywhere other than in an ini file
[01:56:08] <nedbat> __adrian: it is an ini file, but because it is about this particular site, I wanted it to be part of the site.
[01:56:56] <nedbat> the docs for user_ini sound like they would do what I want, but it's not
[01:57:45] <__adrian> different ini settings for different sites is also a little bit suspect
[01:59:04] <nedbat> __adrian: in this case, it's just one site, but I wanted to keep its configuration together
[01:59:46] <__adrian> understood; i'm saying config (imo) shouldn't go in the ini file.
[02:00:26] <__adrian> i'd put it in a config file  :)
[02:02:13] <nedbat> __adrian: i don't understand: what is an example of a config file?
[02:02:39] <__adrian> it's a file that you provide to your applciation with config settings
[02:02:58] <__adrian> e.g., it might be a json file or provided by env vars
[02:03:19] <nedbat> __adrian: i thought that's what i was doing with php.ini.  Can you point me to a resource that explains that style of configuration?
[02:08:07] <__adrian> i don't have something specific. ini files are effectively "global" settings for php, as opposed to belonging to a particular project/application
[02:09:42] <Blondie101010> my interpretation was something like wanting a different memory_limit per site or similar
[02:10:43] <nedbat> Blondie101010: i need to adjust the include path, for example, but maybe I'll just put it in my ~/.php and move on.  my old host reads the local files, and I don't know why
[02:11:12] <__adrian> i'd very highly recommend NOT relying on include_path, ever. recommend always using fully qualified paths.
[02:12:31] <Blondie101010> yeah, that makes troubleshooting so much more annoying
[02:14:01] <Blondie101010> an easy way to handle relative path includes is to make them relative to the initial script that gets called with its __DIR__
[02:14:17] <nedbat> Blondie101010: do you have an example I could see?
[02:14:58] <Blondie101010> you have the site, so you put the right paths in your includes
[02:15:09] <__adrian> e.g.,  require "foo.php";  // no
[02:15:10] <Blondie101010> it's hard to provide an example of a full deployment
[02:15:16] <__adrian> require __DIR__ . "/foo.php";  // yes
[02:15:21] <nedbat> Blondie101010: i'm in the process of moving it from one host to another.  The full paths would have to change.
[02:15:39] <Blondie101010> if it was already done that way, no change would be needed
[02:16:05] <__adrian> mooving sites does not prevent you from doing this - in fact that's a problem it solves
[02:16:21] <__adrian> make your project root directory a config setting, or const
[02:16:40] <__adrian> e.g., in your project root dir,  const PROJECT_ROOT_DIR = __DIR__;
[02:16:42] <nedbat> __adrian: __DIR__ solves it, yes.  "put the right paths in your includes" would have to change.
[02:16:49] <__adrian> require PROJECT_ROOT_DIR . "/foo.php";  // yes
[02:16:57] <__adrian> yes, it would
[02:17:16] <nedbat> thanks for the advice
[02:17:27] <Blondie101010> the project root const is my 2nd option as it depends on handling a config file
[02:27:03] <__adrian> welcome
[02:46:27] <nedbat> __adrian: you said, "in your project root dir, const PROJECT_ROOT_DIR = __DIR__;".  What file would that go in and what would ensure that file is read?
[02:47:09] <da_wunder> first entrypoint of your application like index.php
[02:47:13] <__adrian> ^
[02:48:16] <nedbat> at the risk of being told I am doing it wrong again, I have many .html files. Apache is configured to treat them as PHP.  Each has require_once("inc/reactor_class.php") at the top.
[02:48:41] <__adrian> if you aren't using a single point of entry, then you (should consider changing that, or) would need to put it in a common setup/"bootstrap" file
[02:49:10] <__adrian> yeah, single point of entry is far preferable
[02:49:11] <da_wunder> I really recommend to use single entry point file
[02:49:45] <__adrian> in your case, that common "reactor_class" file might be a place to put it
[02:50:10] <nedbat> __adrian: sorry, a place to put what?  I can't read that file yet.
[02:51:54] <__adrian> that's one of the problems with not using a single point of entry - you have many entry points to account for  :)
[02:52:06] <da_wunder> ^
[02:52:14] <__adrian> that first common include file would need to be spelled out each time
[02:52:30] <da_wunder> just start to use single entry point for your application
[02:59:16] <__adrian> "being told I am doing it wrong again"  it's much more good-natured than that makes it sound  :)
[02:59:51] <Albright> Can someone explain to me in little words why using a DI library like https://container.thephpleague.com/4.x/ is better than just hard-coding the dependencies into your classes themselves? I don't understand what good the abstraction does.
[03:00:14] <Albright> I mean, I guess the dependencies are still hard-coded anyway…
[03:00:20] <__adrian> no
[03:00:24] <Albright> "What is it you say you do here?"
[03:00:29] <__adrian> it's not the library you need, just the "DI" part  :)
[03:00:35] <nedbat> da_wunder: tbh, i'm unlikely to make that large a change, but how would it work? I need many different .html URL to use PHP logic in the pages.
[03:01:43] <__adrian> maybe you'll use a library, but the point is to pass things you need as arguments.
[03:02:18] <__adrian> this makes things less dependent. more flexible, easier to change (and test), easier to debug, harder to break.
[03:02:26] <da_wunder> or just simple mod_rewrite rule
[03:04:00] <__adrian> nedbat: yeah, not a big a change as it sounds. might be as simple as making a map of all your existing routes, use FallbackResource to send everything to your new entry point. from there you do the setup work and then require PROJECT_ROOT . "/pages/that-one.html";
[03:04:17] <Albright> Yeah, I get the basics of DI. I'm just missing what this library does to improve or enforce things.
[03:04:38] <__adrian> for bigger projects, a library can handle things like configuration and autowiring
[03:04:57] <__adrian> but in the end, a library might be useful to you, or useless.

[04:29:09] <sams> what do i need to do to get the dynamic 'items' section inserted from another function? is there a trick to inserting the array structure? https://developer.paypal.com/docs/business/checkout/server-side-api-calls/create-order/#1-add-server-code
[04:30:13] <Blondie101010> sams:  isn't that a string?
[04:30:30] <__adrian> you need to switch to the php example
[04:31:20] <__adrian> sams: "items" is an array, assigned to the main array's [purchase_units][0] array
[04:31:24] <__adrian> you assign with  =
[04:31:51] <__adrian> i.e.,  $array["purchase_units"][0]["items"] = $your_array_of_items
[04:32:22] <__adrian> (verify; i just skimmed that example)
[04:33:15] <sams> the second blob of code is where i am at, the items there, i tried doing a return with the similar code in items but wont accept it
[04:33:45] <sams> im trying to inject some specific items then parse it
[04:33:49] <__adrian> do you know what you want the array to look like?
[04:34:10] <__adrian> if so, please share, and also share the code you're using to try to build it. (use a paste site, not here on the channel)
[04:34:23] <sams> similar to whats there just different products and prices
[04:34:26] <__adrian> if you don't know, then you need to figure that out first - that's a paypal question
[04:34:36] <__adrian> k. make us an example.
[04:34:41] <__adrian> e.g., on 3v4l.org
[04:37:52] <sams> my code is the same as on there it is basically blob 2, where i am trying to dynamically change the stuff in 'items' before i parse it
[04:38:27] <__adrian> i can't help you with your code if you don't show me your code
[04:38:41] <__adrian> and that includes making sure you clearly understand what you want your code to do
[04:38:46] <sams> tried add a function under items which points to the type of structure in 'items'
[04:38:50] <__adrian> make us an example
[04:38:59] <sams> ok
[04:46:12] <sams> https://3v4l.org/0IFiZ
[04:47:05] <da_wunder> would be nice to provide working example
[04:47:28] <__adrian> ok, so first, seems you don't understand the syntax. that's  necessary first step.
[04:48:07] <__adrian> second, it seems like you have the idea of building _code_ out of strings. doesn't (thankfully) work that way.
[04:50:25] <Blondie101010> somehow I knew exactly what his code looked like
[04:51:04] <Blondie101010> but yeah, use arrays and structured code
[04:51:48] <sams> so rather than a string in the function make it an array?
[04:51:53] <__adrian> yes
[04:52:13] <__adrian> you want an array so build an array.  start with  function paypal_items() : array {}
[04:52:25] <__adrian> you'll get an error if you don't return an array  :)
[04:54:24] <__adrian> start with an empty array, which will hold your list of items. loop to build each $item and add it to that array. then return that array.
[04:54:52] <Blondie101010> any comments on the alternate syntax here? (yuck)
[04:54:52] <__adrian> $item = ["name" => $name, ...etc.];
[04:55:02] <__adrian> the alternate syntax is a syntax error
[04:55:11] <__adrian> that's why i made point #1, learn the syntax
[04:55:47] <__adrian> don't use alt syntax. but more importantly, don't try to use BOTH syntaxes.
[04:55:54] <__adrian> use { braces }
[05:12:59] <sams> made the array, returned it but same result?
[05:13:32] <__adrian> show us
[05:15:13] *** Parts: nedbat (~nedbat@python/psf/nedbat) (Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[05:15:46] <sams> https://3v4l.org/OXj9FT
[05:16:38] <__adrian> "don't try to use BOTH syntaxes"
[05:17:05] <__adrian> use { braces }. don't use the alternate syntax.   foreach () { yes }   foreach: no endforeach;
[05:17:47] <__adrian> so, this is also not a working example. add "mock" data (i.e., not coming from a DB that doesn't exist on 3v4l) so we (and you) can see what it does.
[05:18:02] <__adrian> then at the end, add  var_dump(paypal_items());
[05:18:10] <__adrian> and we'll be able to see the return value.
[05:19:09] <__adrian> "sams> made the array, returned it but same result?"  and no, this would not produce (remotely) the same result.
[05:21:30] <sams> ok that was silly of me with the foreach, sorted now. :P
[05:23:16] <sams> by same result i mean it isnt parsing
[05:23:28] <__adrian> ok. what's the error you see?

[05:25:55] <__adrian> that doesn't contain an actual error message. is this your system? are you logging the messages to file?
[05:27:15] <sams> thats the error it is psitting out

[05:30:22] *** Quits: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm) (Quit: "")
[05:30:36] <sams> ignore the first one, latter is the paypal message
[05:30:51] <da_wunder> and really that code where you use that $blah - really refactor that
[05:31:20] <__adrian> k. so for starters, don't make the paypal request until you know your array looks like you expect.
[05:31:30] <__adrian> then, make sure you've got error reporting set up correctly
[05:31:33] <__adrian> !+error reporting
[05:31:33] <php-bot> Set `error_reporting = -1` in your php.ini (to see errors on your webpage, also set `display_errors = 1`) and be sure to restart your webserver/fastcgi-listeners. Using `ini_set()` and `error_reporting()` is less reliable - for example, in the case of parse errors. See https://php.net/errorfunc.configuration or "/msg php-bot error logging" for more.
[05:31:43] <da_wunder> and if the issue that paypal is returning you that kind of message - please check what you're actually sending there
[05:32:07] <__adrian> see my comment above re: var_dump() to see what your array looks like
[05:32:17] <da_wunder> ^
[05:32:34] <sams> k
[05:36:18] <sams> https://3v4l.org/H53bX
[05:37:11] <__adrian> good. so now compare that to what you _want_ it to look like (it's easier to read formatted). is it the same?
[05:38:50] <sams> i know how i want it to look like, i just dont know how to do it in main section? all i got there is a call to the function.
[05:39:33] <__adrian> "sams> i know how i want it to look like"  // yes, i understand that. i'm saying you need to compare what you want to what your code is producing. are they the same?
[05:40:25] <sams> no they arent
[05:40:47] <sams> needs to be in the format of thatpaypal url?
[05:40:53] <__adrian> no
[05:40:55] <sams> the second blob
[05:41:02] <__adrian> forget about URLs and http requests
[05:41:15] <__adrian> that doesn't matter until the array is right. do the array first.
[05:41:34] <__adrian> show us the comparison.
[05:42:58] <sams> https://3v4l.org/Wu0iY this is what it needs to look like for it to work for me
[05:43:39] <sams> so that function needs to bring that not an array?
[05:45:36] <__adrian> "this is what it needs to look like"  show us the comparison. both that, and the array your code produces.
[05:45:37] <sams> if i have that in main section everything works as is, but i cannot import something like that based on dynamic items
[05:46:18] <sams> hence why i used a sting in function
[05:46:46] <__adrian> do you understand that strings ≠ code?
[05:47:52] <sams> well im just trying to bring in the same syntax, shrug
[05:49:36] <__adrian> strings are (effectively) text
[05:50:02] <__adrian> building a string of text does not make code.
[05:50:16] <__adrian> it's important to understand that distinction
[05:51:20] <__adrian> the next thing, as i said above, is we need to see your expected vs. actual results, compared. this is how you troubleshoot and debug code. find the specific differences, and that will show you which part of your code is not doing what you expect.

[16:05:04] <olle> Anyone heard of "change coupling" before?
[16:05:21] <olle> Similar to logic coupling, where software artefacts change together, historically in the commit history.
[16:05:25] <olle> artifacts*
[16:05:43] <olle> It's possible to base fault prediction on it, it seems.
[16:06:28] <olle> But you can't find out by only analyzing the code, you need the history of the code.
[16:14:26] <[twisti]> sounds like a typical client/server development
[16:14:42] *** Joins: mIk3_08 (~Thunderbi@user/mik3-08/x-2852566)
[16:14:57] <[twisti]> where each server version only works with a specific client version, and they are only coupled by the deploying people knowing what commit goes with what
[16:21:33] <olle> [twisti]: No, this happens in all software.
[16:21:57] <olle> Because there's never a 1-to-1 relation between change request and software artifact. Sadly.
[16:22:03] <olle> Cross-cutting concerns etc
[16:22:23] <olle> Well, sometimes there are such a 1-to-1 relation. :)
