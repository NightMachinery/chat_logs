[00:01:06] <LibertyDillo> and the one I am with uses a standard Texas lease form, so it's all very much legal

[00:45:32] <TXDillo> good little 50cc
[00:45:51] <murthy> TXDillo: +1
[00:45:59] <TXDillo> it may lack power, but it's hard to beat 90-100mpg

[02:13:52] <artao> when Soren was here maybe. but this is the first I've heard ot that
[02:13:59] <artao> you'd think they'd inform the tenants about such a thing
[02:14:25] <artao> and difficulties renting "...  due to, as the applicants say, a “dumpy” appearance"
[02:14:35] <louipc> cover it up with a tarp. then its not clutter anymore

[02:33:29] <louipc> murthy: that is a good policy man
[02:33:56] <SteppenwolfVM> i started using irc through ircnet, i'm not on there anymore but the general tenor there was "just pm to pm, don't ask", i was quite confused when i found several places on freenode, many years ago already, where the topic asked to ask for permission before pm-ing. 
[02:34:10] <SteppenwolfVM> i mean, if i don't want private contact with someone, i just ignore whatever they send me

[03:10:24] <Bakunin> I am not a heavy music listener much anymore, other than like Tool or maybe 70s art/prog shit 
[03:10:29] <murthy> Bakunin: oh wait, did you hear that solo
[03:10:40] <Bakunin> this one band, however, sometimes, makes me think that alchemy exists
[03:10:46] <Bakunin> yeah
[03:10:47] <murthy> Ya
[03:10:58] <murthy> Omg I am getting euphoric
[03:11:06] <murthy> Every time
[03:11:21] <Bakunin> yes
[03:11:53] <Bakunin> their latest LP was unfulfilling to me personally.. vocals too strained n weird on Omens.  Couple great moments tho
[03:12:05] <Bakunin> Have you heard Lore?
[03:12:33] <Bakunin> this is the closest thing to Reflections that rules equally as much :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzDm6ImLtHc

[03:17:00] <murthy> Ya
[03:17:43] <murthy> That diwali sweet gifts seems attracted my mind
[03:18:05] <nativetexan> so i had a very unusual morning
[03:18:16] <murthy> That big one?
[03:18:27] <murthy> 5000+ one?
[03:18:29] <nativetexan> something woke me up around 4:30am and sounded like bush brushing against my window
[03:18:43] <nativetexan> then it sounded like something was in my attic
[03:18:45] <murthy> Oh
[03:18:56] <nativetexan> like maybe a squirrel
[03:19:22] <nativetexan> but then it sounded too heavy to be a squirrel and it sounded like it was on my roof
[03:19:48] <nativetexan> like a 200 pound person on my roof walking across my bedroom on the roof
[03:19:52] <nativetexan> so i get up

[03:21:07] <artao> Anyone like that can pretty much fuck right off at the get go, self important assholes.
[03:21:16] <nativetexan> i went and turned on my rear patio light and i could here someone running across the roof and jump off

[03:33:41] <SteppenwolfVM> murthy: i had cut suger out of my diet entirely some years ago, until i helplessly asked a policeman at an train stop that i feel aggressive for no reason whatsoever despite not eating any sugar and all and if he knew what i could do before this mood puts me in trouble 
[03:33:54] <louipc> we should have a screaming/growling comprehension test

[03:34:28] <louipc> need to train up my ears again

[03:46:36] <louipc> oh u said u want a real drum and that your kit sound robotic or something
[03:46:38] <macrobat> I like some electronic sounds, but electronic music is often boring wrt phrasing, rhythm, groove
[03:46:55] <louipc> SteppenwolfVM: u dont know bout triggers? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(drums)
[03:46:56] <Janet> ^ In drumming, a trigger is an electronic transducer that can be attached to a drum, cymbal or other instrument to enable it to control an electronic drum unit or similar device. Specialised triggers are produced for specific instruments.
[03:47:23] <nativetexan> back, i agree with macrobat on the elctronic music
[03:47:33] <louipc> attach trigger to real kit
[03:47:40] <louipc> but some ppl think its robotic too
[03:47:52] <murthy> nativetexan: wb
[03:47:55] <nativetexan> ty
[03:48:04] <louipc> i guess it is, i think they become more advanced/dynamic tho
[03:48:26] <murthy> nativetexan: SteppenwolfVM is on same page with macrobat
[03:48:32] <SteppenwolfVM> louipc: there are several definitions of "trigger". i was thinking of step sequencer triggers, hence the confusion 
[03:48:52] <SteppenwolfVM> i like constant music with not too much change, actually
[03:48:56] <SteppenwolfVM> aside of hardcore 
[03:49:26] <SteppenwolfVM> even in the hardcore music i like, there is a constant, kinda droning base sound present
[03:49:28] <louipc> triggers kinda like pickups for drums i guess 
[03:49:33] <SteppenwolfVM> if this sound is removed, and things get too wild, i'm out
[03:49:38] <SteppenwolfVM> ah
[03:49:39] <nativetexan> it's tough to beat the human musician touch on an instrument

[03:50:53] <SteppenwolfVM> :D

[03:52:43] <artao> it IS lame
[03:52:47] <artao> and i won't be evicted
[03:52:52] <SteppenwolfVM> for example, even the wildest hardcore still has an constant, ongoing rhythm or bass line or whatever
[03:53:00] <artao> i've already remedied the "problem" even tho it's ridiculous and petty
[03:53:12] <buZz> SteppenwolfVM: try Igorrr
[03:53:22] <SteppenwolfVM> however, some bands really remove all constant events, so you're left with nothing to listen for but pure chaos, and that really irritates me then
