[17:25:33] <Joanna> Mac OS lets you download apps with some safe guards
[17:28:58] <Joanna> The problem with iOS is you might have to use the language they want which is currently swift.

[17:29:16] <Joanna> Hey iz welcome
[17:29:21] <iz> hi all
[17:29:55] <Joanna> I didn’t know hash owns other channel I thought Nijan started it.
[17:30:19] <iz> he squatted a bunch of general name channels at the switch over
[17:30:48] <iz> and i think w/ #security, he like gave the name back in exchange for being made an op or something like that
[17:31:01] <Joanna> It’s really strange there it’s like all the ops active on freenode don’t op anymore and just lurk
[17:31:50] <iz> he's still squatting on #physics and he gave back #crypto, but goes in that channel pretty often to complain about how no one appreciates that he gave the name back and everyone should be thanking him all the time!!
[17:32:09] <Joanna> I don’t think he is opped according to flags
[17:33:17] <iz> last time i was in security, he was bringing him stupid bot in and had the op flag and was ironically telling me i needed to learn how to talk to people, so i just left.  I have no need or desire for any of that kind of bullshit
[17:33:23] <iz> *his
[17:34:25] <Joanna> Do you know anyone else there who is unhappy with the situation? If so please tell them that there is an alternate channel
[17:35:41] <Joanna> It does seem like he controls the channel along with the lame link in the topic.
[17:36:24] <iz> not really, but i already see a lot of familiar names here, so hopefully ppl will figure it out.. i'm gonna refer anyone looking for security chats to this channel in the future though, vs just not recommending anything
[17:37:34] <Joanna> Trolls are definitely not allowed to troll here
[17:38:17] <Joanna> In other channel it seems like some of the ops are kind of hostile to people asking questions also
[17:41:54] <Atque> Joanna: Do you know if Apple approves cordova, reactnative, phonegap etc. (frameworks for iOS/Android) apps for the appstore?
[17:42:48] <Joanna> Sorry I have no idea I’m not an iOS developer maybe there is an iOS or Mac channel that might know
[17:43:19] <Joanna> Hmm
[17:43:39] <JimBuntu> Atque, I can say that they approve of reactnative
[17:44:02] <Joanna> There is an ##ios channel with 9 members
[17:45:11] <Atque> Joanna: Yeah, was probably more an ##mac or ##apple question I guess. >< It is interesting, there's a security benefit, but I feel like the loss of autonomy for developers is a bigger problem (even ignoring anti-competitive elements, like requiring swift).
[17:45:16] <Atque> JimBuntu: Cool
[17:46:41] <Joanna> I’ve heard there are ways to develop without swift but they might be complicated
[17:47:19] <Joanna> I’d like to make apps for iOS but I’m not using swift

[17:53:48] <Joanna> I don’t much care for the treadmill of learning new languages I just want to be really good at one or two languages
[17:59:51] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@5.77.171.254) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[18:01:44] <Atque> Yeah, I agree tbh. There's all these duplicate things you need to learn and keep up to date with. I always imagined Java, C++ etc. would stay dominate forever. golang, swift and koitlin all have their pros, but it makes it hard to be a generalist developer I guess.
[18:04:47] <Joanna> It is completely unnecessary in my opinion. It’s like they don’t want older developers to have job security. It’s also bad from a security perspective for all these people to be programming in languages they hardly know which have many defects such as no type checking in javascript.
[18:07:47] *** Joins: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn)
[18:08:02] <iz> much of the concepts are the same regardless of language though -- it's just syntax
[18:08:41] <iz> if you know how to do OOP, you can do java or C++ or golang or python or ruby or whatever
[18:09:24] <Joanna> That’s true . It’s easiest for me to write down algorithms in English then translate into computer code.
[18:09:25] <iz> pointers and data types are common concepts that happen in most languages, etc
[18:10:10] <Atque> iz: Yeah, some languages lean toward functional programming I guess (Scala, F# and Huskell). C++, Java, Koitlin, Swift etc. are all pretty similar OOP/imperative programming type languages.
[18:10:52] <iz> yeah, functional langs are kinda its own category.. but procedural languages will have a lot in common
[18:11:10] <Joanna> I think some languages are more prone to mischief than others though. I’m sure you have all heard about malware hidden in plain sight in normal looking code.
[18:11:21] <iz> funcitonal langs are more like pure math than programming, imho
[18:12:18] <Atque> Joanna: Yup, memory safety is important too tbh. It's less of an issue nowadays on up-to-date OSes, but C is a bit risky still in that space than something like golang I guess.
[18:12:30] <Atque> iz: Haha, yeah, lambda calculus :)
[18:12:38] <iz> yup, i think that's why places use "newer" languages over like C or the old standards
[18:13:05] <iz> like just doing everything in rust or some language that is safer can solve a lot of issues before they even come up
[18:13:40] <iz> and save a lot of time and cost that would usually go into catching/finding/fixing those bugs
[18:14:44] <Joanna> Atque: c programmers are rather arrogant and are very proud of themselves:)
[18:15:41] <Atque> iz: Yup, I would far prefer debug a scala program than deal with seg faults and all in C. Haven't had an opportunity to play with rust sadly.

[18:15:53] <Joanna> From what I’ve heard it is very difficult not to make deadly mistakes in c :)
[18:17:03] <Atque> Joanna: Yeah, I would say a lot of vulnerabilities originate in C code more than C# and what not.
[18:17:35] <Joanna> String handling.. I’m no expert in c ..
[18:18:12] <Atque> Yeah, it's easier to create buffer overruns in C.
[18:18:54] <Atque> You can do that in C++ too, depending on a programmer's style. Some people avoid STL like the plague for some reason and treat C++ similar to C, which is probably not the best practice imo.
[18:20:15] <Joanna> C++ seems more pleasant than c but probably inherited the flaws of c

[18:23:38] <Atque> C++ more unnecessarily complicated tbh... has a lot of moving parts.
[18:24:20] <jessicara> it often feels like the line between extra library and standard library blurred
[18:25:53] <Atque> Yeah, the C++ standard library and BOOST seem to blur as the standards go up.
