[00:00:33] <gwern> so you'd expect just as many 'psilocybin made me smell again!' or 'DMT made me smell again!' LSD should only be, like, half of the anecdotes on either the social-contagion-placebo or neural-annealing viewpoints
[00:00:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Almost entirely
[00:00:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Actually, it's a bit worse / more complicated than that
[00:01:08] * gwern finally finds the real space leak and is really surprised. wow, memory use went *way* down
[00:01:15] <ggreer> https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14146-gay-brains-structured-like-those-of-the-opposite-sex/ lol imagine that study coming out today
[00:01:16] <Robomot> Gay brains structured like those of the opposite sex | New Scientist (Brain scans have provided the most compelling evidence yet that being gay or straight is a biologically fixed trait)
[00:01:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> If I sniff something with a strong scent, I get the *sensation* of smelling it, but there's no perceived scent
[00:01:41] <two2thehead> huh
[00:01:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's pretty weird
[00:01:59] <two2thehead> 2008, yeah I read the study
[00:03:02] <two2thehead> tl;dr got the brainscan from a group of straight men, a group of straight women and a group of gay men. Averaged the group together, and compared between groups
[00:06:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The full-blown version is rare (though not vanishingly so; I'm treating a patient with this right now), but very mild persisting hallucinations seem to be pretty common." ... and can also happen with things other than LSD; for example, I once had this with weed for well over a year
[00:07:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> (of HPPD)
[00:09:29] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, if you are blinded, does the sensation go away if you do not know but by smell if there is smell nearby?
[00:10:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: First of all, I don't have nearly enough sensitivity to know if there's a smell just "nearby"
[00:11:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am talking about e.g. opening a jar of peanut butter or a bottle of soy sauce and putting it right up to my face
[00:11:53] <kuudes> I mean, if you put febreze or pepper or similar to a container, and then an assistant brings that or empty container under your nose while you are blinded, do you get the sensation of smell if there is true smell and not if there is not?
[00:12:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have no idea
[00:12:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't have any assistants sitting around to try this with
[00:13:07] <kuudes> :-(
[00:13:15] <kuudes> in any case, my condolences :-(
[00:13:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> thx
[00:13:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> So ok, the tl;dr of this LSD/anosmia post is ... predictive processing???
[00:15:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... gasp
[00:16:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Scott links to readthesequences.com :O
[00:16:46] <mst> \o/
[00:17:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I dunno. I'm certainly not about to drop acid to try and fix this shit (yet)
[00:18:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't wanna get my cognitive priors weakened
[00:18:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's how you get dumbass posts about woo on LW
[00:20:12] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: "I get the *sensation* of smelling it, but there's no perceived scent"  Wow, this sucks in a way I didn't expect it to.  (When I lost the sense of smell due to COVID, it didn't feel like I could smell things.)  Sorry about this.  If my mom tries Semax to fix her on-and-off post-COVID sense of smell, I'll tell you about the results.
[00:21:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: Definitely do. Probably I'd be more willing to try that than LSD
[00:21:30] <gwern> perhaps the trick would be to set up a bunch of aromatics and perfumes etc during your LSD trip, and focus hard on those, and avoid thinking about oneness with the All And Everything
[00:21:35] <ggreer> "semax"? there's no way you'd name a compound that- ohhh it's russian
[00:21:56] <dbohdan> ggreer: Yeah
[00:21:57] <ggreer> semax sounds like something you'd sell at nightclubs to drunk bros
[00:22:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah it's one of those "an iron curtain has descended over psychopharmacology" ones
[00:22:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm guessing I can get my hands on it if I wanted to though
[00:22:45] <RiversHaveWings> dbohdan: ...can you get it without ordering it online where you are?
[00:23:29] <dbohdan> FWIW, I've taken it and didn't notice any psychoactive effects (nor should I have)
[00:24:37] <dbohdan> RiversHaveWings: Yep.  It's either OTC or by prescription in the ol' People's Republic.  (I am not sure, because pharmacies rarely ask for prescriptions.)
[00:24:45] <RiversHaveWings> Thought so~
[00:25:18] <dbohdan> ggreer: There have been more recent studies comparing gay male and female brains.  For example, https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203189
[00:25:19] <Robomot> Multimodal MRI suggests that male homosexuality may be linked to cerebral midline structures (The neurobiology of sexual preference is often discussed in terms of cerebral sex dimorphism. Yet, our knowledge about possible cerebral differences between homosexual men (HoM), heterosexual men (HeM) and heterosexual women (HeW) are extremely limited. …)
[00:25:47] <ggreer> dbohdan: yeah. I was just commenting on how that 2008 study would get the authors cancelled if it were published today
[00:26:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,4168.msg313.html#new weird argument
[00:26:37] <Robomot> Educationrealist: number of white students in academically intensive schools is low partly by choice (Educationrealist: number of white students in academically intensive schools is low partly by choice)
[00:26:57] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: that's why I read him
[00:27:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Although this part is true-ish: "Opinion: whites are uninterested in the NYC specialized high schools because of the Asian immigrant culture." ... with the caveat that s/uninterested/less interested/
[00:27:32] <adiabatic> he also fails to point out that most black students who can hack it at stuy are probably getting sucked up into the local private schools on a full-ride scholarship
[00:27:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I can tell you that nobody thinks that any local public schools are better than Stuy/BxSci/BkTech
[00:27:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's just a ridiculous claim
[00:27:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or even as good
[00:29:10] <dbohdan> ggreer: I've read it before, and I am not sure.  It doesn't seem different enough from the 2018 one I linked to make one cancel-worthy and the other not.
[00:29:14] <adiabatic> maybe, but they might have _enough_ of a high-pass filter to make them worthwhile
[00:31:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, anyone been watching https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)#Reception ?
[00:31:46] <Robomot> Harley Quinn (TV series) - Wikipedia [Reception] (Harley Quinn is an American adult animated superhero television series based on the DC Comics character of the same name created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm. …)
[00:35:36] <gwern> educationrealist doesn't seem to actually run the order stats. whenever I've run them, hunter and the magnets etc always seemed pretty plausible
[00:35:50] <adiabatic> 'order stats'?
[00:35:57] <gwern> yes, the tail effects
[00:36:14] <adiabatic> The tail effects of…?
[00:36:16] <gwern> (he notes a disparity on taking the exam, but that's as easily effect as it is cause)
[00:36:24] <gwern> oh, IQs and/or exam scores
[00:37:01] <adiabatic> like, there are lots of kids there who all get 1600s on the SAT but have fairly varying IQs because the SAT only goes up so high?
[00:37:45] <gwern> no, just that since east asian > white > hispanic > black and those schools are selecting on >3SDs, you will get multipliers like 5:1 or 15:1
[00:37:48] *** Joins: inky (~inky@46.36.116.211)
[00:37:50] <adiabatic> or are you talking about how two bell curves with means of 100 and 105 will have, on the far right of both, have lots of people in the 105 group
[00:38:08] <gwern> the further out on the tail you go, the wilder the disparity becomes because the tail drops off so rapidly with each additional SD
[00:39:02] <gwern> if you ask what the ratio of >=1 SD (for one group) vs >=2 SD (for another group penalized by 1 SD), it's relatively modest, like 2:1. if you go to >=2 vs >=3, or >=3 vs >=4...
[00:39:30] <two2thehead> hmm
[00:39:39] <gwern> so at the magnet schools or SMPY or hunter, it's perfectly possible to have like 30:1 Asian vs hispanic or whathave you
[00:40:18] <gwern> there is no need to invoke additional motivations like 'hispanic mothers just don't like magnet schools and won't have their kids apply'
[00:40:54] <two2thehead> is that what the official term is for that?

[00:46:43] <catern> no this was worse than that
[00:47:00] <catern> i put some pizza sauce on my frozen naan in preparation to make it into a mini-pizza and after I did that I noticed mold on the pizza sauce lid
[00:47:03] <catern> so I had to throw it out
[00:47:17] <gwern> oh no ;_;
[00:47:34] *** Quits: galambo (galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:47:37] <catern> exactly
[00:48:01] <two2thehead> catern, the pain you are feeling, is second to naan
[00:49:05] <gwern> it is so large that it is... Naan
[00:49:21] <dbohdan> Frozen NaN.  Every food you add it to becomes frozen NaN.
[00:49:41] <kuudes> XD
[00:49:55] <gwern> dbohdan: well, it's moldy naan now. so if you add any good good to it, it just becomes naan. like the joke about sewage and vats of wine
[00:50:10] <two2thehead> kuudes, pls! Don't laugh at his pain
[00:50:22] <catern> i appreciate the messages of support, all
[00:54:11] <mst> I ... would've thrown out the sauce jar but assumed cooking it would kill the mold
[00:59:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> So I read that Jacqueline Carey story in this collection I am reading... it was good. Carey is a solid writer, can't deny that, and the story did not feature Phedre at all (the viewpoint character was Anafiel Delaunay), so I appreciated not having to put up with the whole "Phedre is the best and wins at everything forever" thing that turned me off when I tried to read the Kushiel series
[01:00:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> But still I couldn't help but feel... well, basically, the way I felt about this story (and also one of the big problems I had with the Kushiel series) was like... you know those memes of Stalin going "Very funny! You go to gulag!"
[01:00:50] <mst> I've read all 9, and I suspect I'll only ever re-read the first trilogy
[01:01:05] <mst> the other two kinda felt like re-runs thereof
[01:01:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, the background assumption for any of this shit to take place is that 100% of these characters are so rich that their lives can revolve entirely around this soap-opera / court-intrigue bullshit
[01:03:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> So it's just ... "oh no! this dude got beaten at court intrigue and/or romantic plotting by this other chick! now he's *just* a rich asshole who is automatically financially secure for the rest of his life without having to do anything!"
[01:03:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> And just ... go to gulag
[01:04:25] <mst> "do not pass go, do not collect 200 kulaks"
[01:06:00] <ggreer> https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1422616981681881091 people definitely did that at work events. now that we're on zoom it's an internal mental check
[01:06:30] <|dbotdan> Paul Graham (@paulg, 2021-08-03 17:54): ‘People do this constantly in the Bay Area. Not in England yet, though, at least not in the rural bit I live in.’
[01:07:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then there's another story that's written by some woman whose claim to fame, as far as I can deduce from the author bio, is that she's, like, Ms. Feminist SF
[01:07:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the story itself is absolutely the most shamelessly stereotypical "supernatural romance" pure-female-masturbation-fantasy shit imaginable
[01:08:58] <gwern> empowering females to masturbate, sounds feminist
[01:09:26] <rmmh> that's the majority of kindle
[01:10:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> An English teacher takes a job in Texas, where she meets this dude who has this wolf, whom he rescued from having been abused or something, and adopted it, and now he takes care of this wolf all day because he cares so much; she accompanies dude + wolf to the forest (because wolf needs a run, obviously) and there's a scene where they come back from the forest and dude is drenched in sweat and he casually takes his shirt off in
[01:10:09] <Obormot\Arcturus>  front of Ms. English Teacher and she just *swoons*
[01:10:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> THEN it turns out he's a drug dealer; she's very angry; but he offers to abandon his drug dealing ways and change, just for her; and she swoons again
[01:10:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> etc. etc.
[01:11:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Then there's some supernatural shit which is predictably nonsensical, like the author was not even bothering to make it coherent - I mean, why bother, right? Who even cares)
[01:12:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Tuttle I mean look at this bio
[01:12:00] <Robomot> Lisa Tuttle - Wikipedia (Lisa Gracia Tuttle (born September 16, 1952)[2] is an American-born science fiction, fantasy, and horror author. She has published more than a dozen novels, seven short story collections, and several non-fiction titles, including a reference book on feminism, Encyclopedia of Feminism (1986). She has also edited several anthologies and reviewed books for various publications. …)
[01:12:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Encyclopedia of Feminism!
[01:12:18] <catern> and he's a werewolf or something?
[01:12:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Or something
[01:12:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Tuttle's fiction often focuses on gender issues and includes "strong-willed women" who question their identities. British author David V. Barrett wrote that her stories are "emotionally uncomfortable", and that "they not only make you think, they make you feel".[1]" ... oh yeah, I'll just bet
[01:13:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Her science fiction works have been associated with feminist science fiction, and The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English said that many of her stories use elements of science fiction and horror to "dramatize aspects of the human, and specifically the female, condition".[6]" ... uh-huh
[01:13:40] <gwern> questions her identity as what, a lesbian? a schoolteacher? a woman?
[01:16:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> The protagonist of this story is a college instructor, naturally
[01:17:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's this one scene where one of her students walks by and sees her sitting in the car (a big black SUV, no less!) of this wolf-friend and/or drug dealer and does a double take, and she thinks "Hah! See, your boring English teacher has a life outside the classroom!"
[01:18:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the kind of story element that makes you go "Hmmmm"
[01:19:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> The best of modern fantasy fiction, folks
[01:19:47] <kuudes> "Orban is so admired by so many Americans obsessed with the Clinton Foundation" <- is this true? that sounds odd
[01:19:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> You may not like it, but this is what peak sf looks like
[01:20:40] <kuudes> "American media personalities express admiration for Orban" <- does someone who matters admire orban from usa? O_o
[01:21:08] <gwern> aha, she questions her identity as a college instructor rather than kindergarten teacher
[01:21:29] <kuudes> oh, trumpists, ok
[01:21:43] <gwern> I think more nrx-y and maybe tradcaths
[01:21:59] <gwern> I can't imagine that a lot of the MAGA base like the qanoners really know or care about orban
[01:22:23] <kuudes> yeah, I guess
[01:25:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bone_Flute
[01:25:54] <Robomot> The Bone Flute - Wikipedia ("The Bone Flute" is a science fiction short story by American writer Lisa Tuttle, first published in the May 1981 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. The story won the 1982 Nebula Award for Best Short Story, a prize that Tuttle refused, becoming the first (and so far only) author to do so.[1] …)
[01:26:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, so the author bio mentioned this too and now I'm curious
[01:26:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In 1982, the story was selected as one of the finalists for the Nebula Award for Best Short Story. Tuttle became aware that writer George Guthridge, also nominated in that category for his story "The Quiet", was campaigning his story by sending out copies of it to SFWA members with a covering letter written by The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction editor Ed Ferman at his request.[2]
[01:26:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Disapproving this situation, Tuttle sent a letter to Nebula Awards director Frank Catalano, asking to withdraw her story from the competition as a sign of protest, her complaints being that the awards weren't making sure that all items up for consideration were sent around to all the voters, also asking to disqualify works which were campaigned for by either the authors or the editors. If these requests were not considered,
[01:26:31] <Obormot\Arcturus>  she considered the whole Nebula Awards a farce in which she did not want to be involved. "
[01:27:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Then she won anyway but also refused anyway)
[01:27:24] <gwern> that sounds semi-reasonable, if you aren't supposed to campaign. you legitimize cheating if you don't protest or accept the award
[01:27:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Tuttle still refused the award, and asked Grant that her reasons for refusing be made clear at the awards ceremony, which she didn't plan to attend, a request that Grant assured her would be granted.
[01:27:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> At the ceremony, however, editor John Douglas accepted the award on her behalf and no comment was made on Tuttle's reasons for her refusal." ... ah yes, this is part of the "SFWA are assholes" saga
[01:27:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yes, I agree, this definitely inclines me to respect her
[01:28:02] <kuudes> wow
[01:32:06] <mst> sounds like I might not appreciate her work or politics but her spine is impressive nonetheless
[01:35:12] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: I do deeply appreciate the contortions necessary for strong independent woman who needs no man to get into a situation to swoon over a muscular shirtless dude
[01:39:27] <rmmh> that's a lot of romance setups though. you have to work through the guilt/shame to let people fully embrace the fantasy
[01:39:50] <rmmh> see also all the "oh nooo, the law requires us to get gay married" fanfics

[01:45:31] <ggreer> very glad
[01:46:21] <kuudes> "description: a person and a dog in a parking lot"
[01:46:40] <rmmh> neural style identification: doggy
[01:48:02] <kuudes> though, if it was sort of consensual sex, whats the harm
[01:48:15] <kuudes> sounds like there were no other people but the tweeter present
[01:48:25] <rmmh> "in europe, this is normal"
[01:48:54] <kuudes> well, over here the police would, after someone complained, tell those people to stop
[01:49:10] <kuudes> specifically, the police can't do anything if no one complains
[01:49:39] <kuudes> someone has to say they don't like it, then it is up to the persons doing it to stop it
[01:49:58] <kuudes> and if they disobey the police command, then the police can fine them of that disobedience
[01:50:20] <kuudes> but in this case the tweeter complained, so I guess the police should have come to tell them to stop it
[01:50:32] <rmmh> the real trick is there's only a 3 month window where it's possible to do that in finland
[01:50:33] <kuudes> though they did rather soon stop it, so harm does not seem that great
[01:50:33] <ggreer> I'm sure lots of people complained. it's in the middle of a city
[01:50:44] <kuudes> to the police?
[01:50:46] <ggreer> but cops won't do shit in SF
[01:50:47] <ggreer> yes
[01:51:48] <kuudes> rmmh, I think the background here is in the civil war etc
[01:51:58] <kuudes> back then there were a lot of people who owned no land and had no room
[01:52:17] <kuudes> so there arise this whole meme of landowner having public sex being ok and poor person having public sex being arrestworthy
[01:52:30] <rmmh> no the background is puritanism
[01:52:30] <kuudes> and then there was that whole thing where landowners and poor people shot each other a lot
[01:52:48] <kuudes> so we have some cultural background on "lets try to get along, will we"
[01:52:49] <rmmh> being naked in public is illegal in most of america
[01:52:50] <Jayson_Virissimo> When I was attending App Academy and living in the Tenderloin, I used to go study at the Starbucks on Market/10th or somewhere very close tot here.
[01:53:02] <kuudes> what if you have no clothes
[01:53:21] <gwern> 'a person and a dog' furries everywhere
[01:53:38] <Jayson_Virissimo> One time this dude comes in wearing a skirt and proceeds to visit each woman in the store and lift up his skirt in front of them. Of course he wasn't wearing anything underneath.
[01:54:18] <Jayson_Virissimo> He went ahead and helped himself to the food out front, like bananas and little cakes.
[01:54:23] <kuudes> that sounds indeed criminal
[01:54:36] <Jayson_Virissimo> The barista called the police.
[01:55:12] <Jayson_Virissimo> The dude had zero fear of the cops. Stayed another 20 minutes and then left.
[01:55:30] <Jayson_Virissimo> Some PD pulled up about an hour later, right when the guy just happen to come back.

[01:58:47] <ggreer> how? the democratic party controls the city
[01:58:49] <rmmh> because the two party system ensures that votes are split juuust enough to make actual progress that the consituents care enough impossible

[01:59:14] <kuudes> form a 100 person party with the platform that is better? surely other people want better government as well?
[01:59:22] <ggreer> meowcat: I don't think anyone in SF has a concealed carry permit
[01:59:52] <rmmh> aren't CA CCW permits issued at the govt's pleasure, i.e. not
[02:00:13] <meowcat> i still find it baffling how bad SF is at all the things, compared to any other city in the area
[02:00:31] <meowcat> like, put up a freakin public toilet occasionally and there would be less poo on the sidewalk.
[02:00:34] <Jayson_Virissimo> IIRC, CA doesn't issue, so you have to get it from city or county.
[02:00:57] <Jayson_Virissimo> SF will never issue for any reason, whereas the county will, but apparently that requires a bribe of some sort.
[02:01:08] <adiabatic> if they have more public toilets they'll be occupied all the time by men having sex with each other

[02:05:08] <ggreer> most people get permits because it means you can carry in other states that require permits. annoyingly reciprocity is a huge pain. not all states recognize other states' permits

[02:05:51] <rmmh> reciprocity in drivers licenses is hilarious to me

[02:06:37] <kuudes> isn't that the international green card / international driver's licence thing?
[02:06:40] <adiabatic> rmmh: but we're a loooong ways away from the autobahn so it doesn't matter much
[02:06:51] <Jayson_Virissimo> two2thehead: that was in 2015, so I'm sure its much worse now
[02:07:02] <ggreer> I can carry in washington and idaho, but if I travel approximately 1,000 feet south, I can't carry (because I'm so close to oregon and oregon doesn't recognize any other state's permit)
[02:07:13] <ggreer> I've applied for an oregon permit but my interview isn't until september
[02:07:42] <two2thehead> Jayson_Virissimo, one thing I always recommend to my friends is, if possible have what I call universal body cams
[02:07:52] <ggreer> also oregon only grants nonresident permits to people in neighboring states, and even then it's "may issue"
[02:08:05] <two2thehead> Basically optimize on the variable that the median number of cameras in your friend group is >2 
[02:09:08] <ggreer> I think universal body cams would ruin social interactions. there's so much I say that could be taken out of context

[02:10:49] <two2thehead> that's certainly a possibility
[02:11:31] <Jayson_Virissimo> There's a jewelry wholesaler in SF with an active permit.
[02:12:23] <rmmh> wonder how many times he was robbed before they granted the permit

[02:49:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> So anyway, how about that Cuomo shit, eh
[02:50:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Lt. Gov. being all "I believe and applaud these brave women" is particularly shameless
[02:50:21] <adiabatic> not my farm, not my donkeys
[02:50:33] <adiabatic> are they having sex out in the open and scaring the city slickers or something?
[02:51:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: No the state attorney general just came out with a big investigation like "Cuomo sexually harassed a bunch of women"
[02:51:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's *hilariously* transparently political
[02:51:55] <adiabatic> so basically a Klingon promotion ceremony by other means?
[02:52:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's exactly what this is
[02:53:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, like, I don't even particularly doubt that Cuomo did the kinds of things they say he did, or even worse (although I simultaneously don't doubt that at least some of the specific women who are accusing him right now are just making shit up wholesale)
[02:54:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just totally orthogonal to anything resembling the truth or any kind of justice
[02:56:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, apparently they're gonna require proof of vaccination for bars and restaurants and stuff here
[02:56:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/nyc-to-require-restaurant-customers-to-show-vaccination-proof

[02:57:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is particularly ludicrous given that the existing vaccines pretty clearly do not protect against infection by and transmission of the new strain
[02:58:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (They protect against the most severe consequences of getting the new strain, but *what the hell does that have to do with proving you're vaccinated*??)
[02:59:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you think about this policy for more than two seconds, the rationale collapses; it's obviously public health theater
[02:59:18] <ggreer> from the people who brought you the TSA....
[02:59:30] <ggreer> it's not like policies ever make sense at that level
[02:59:49] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: makes sense to me. if people get vaccinated the hospitals don't fill up from people getting fucked over by delta
[02:59:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The move by de Blasio is the latest step to encourage New Yorkers to get vaccinated." ... "encourage"! Can you believe these fuckers

[03:00:58] <kuudes> test pass would make sense
[03:01:10] <kuudes> I agree vaccination pass does not make much sense indeed
[03:01:22] <ggreer> show a positive antibody test or show a positive covid test from more than a few weeks ago
[03:01:41] <kuudes> if infected vaccinated transmit as much as infected unvaccinated, and vaccine only cuts 1/2 - 8/9 of infections

[03:01:50] <two2thehead> kuudes, what's the turnaround time for these tests? Two, three days was the time when I last checked
[03:01:56] <ggreer> shawwwn: I enjoyed that thread yesterday
[03:02:06] <kuudes> two2thehead, same day usually, quick tests hours

[03:02:29] <two2thehead> damn, innovation really DOES progress fast
[03:02:37] <Betawolf> kuudes: you mentioned this before and it's misleading given lower rate of infection in the vaccinated.
[03:02:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "“The safety of our staff family and our guests are our main concern,” Tren’ness Woods-Black, of Sylvia’s Restaurant in Harlem, said during de Blasio’s briefing. “It is a matter of life and death here.”" ... lol.
[03:02:41] <two2thehead> kuudes, +1
[03:03:01] <kuudes> Betawolf, what do you mean?
[03:03:16] <kuudes> that 7/8 is the top of infection prevention for 2 dose pfizer I have seen?
[03:03:46] <kuudes> I guess vaccinated people could take more precautions, which is meaningful in <<100% exposure situations
[03:03:50] <Betawolf> 'infected vaccinated' is conditioning away the relevant situation, vaccinations massively reduce chance of infection.
[03:03:57] <kuudes> no
[03:04:00] <kuudes> they don't
[03:04:11] <rmmh> they do
[03:04:15] <kuudes> they seem to multiply infection probability by 1/9
[03:04:16] <rmmh> but not at a 95% level
[03:04:18] <pompolic> i'm confused, myself
[03:04:26] <kuudes> and recently by about 1/3
[03:04:37] <pompolic> when someone states it as "vaccines don't protect against delta infection" i get upset
[03:04:39] <rmmh> immunity isn't a binary state
[03:04:44] <kuudes> rmmh, well indeed, that depends on definition of "massively"
[03:04:50] <kuudes> imo 1/9 factor is not massive
[03:04:54] <ggreer> that's ridiculously effective for a vaccine. seriously go look at how effective measles vaccines are, or polio vaccines
[03:04:56] <kuudes> 1/20 could be massive by some counts
[03:05:30] <kuudes> the point is that 1/9 factor means that it brings prevalence of 200 to prevalence of 22
[03:05:37] <kuudes> and 22 is too large
[03:05:51] <kuudes> testing will bring it much lower
[03:06:02] <kuudes> and if it is just 1/3, then it brings 200 to 70
[03:06:32] <kuudes> the point of covid passport domestically would be to enable the society to tolerate larger prevalences
[03:07:08] <kuudes> and well, it allows some enlargement. but not as much as wanted
[03:07:21] <kuudes> basicly we are seeking around 20x enlargement, but we may get just maybe 3
[03:07:28] <ggreer> https://twitter.com/CarlosdelRio7/status/1421841919152427009 here are some nice graphs showing the relative risks

[03:07:36] <ggreer> basically the vaccines turn covid into the flu
[03:07:45] <kuudes> over here we will get 100% exposed in next 8 weeks if things go bad.
[03:07:51] <kuudes> then indeed it is just up to vaccine

[03:11:11] <two2thehead> shawwwn, before I forget, how did your job interview go?
[03:12:04] <kuudes> ggreer, will you bet me my 15 euros against your 1000000 dollars that I don't die within 2021?
[03:12:05] <Jayson_Virissimo> Of course, when I worked at PD, the forensics people would give matter-of-fact takes about the "race" of a victim even if their body was very decayed. I never heard anything like "They were native American...we think."
[03:13:14] <Jayson_Virissimo> Maybe they were overconfident, or maybe it's just not that hard to tell when you do it regularly.
[03:13:15] <ggreer> kuudes: my point is that: 1. there are plenty of infectious diseases going around, so worrying about covid specifically (at least once you're vaccinated) doesn't seem worthwhile
[03:13:16] <ggreer> 2. let's say vaccines never get better and covid sticks around forever. would you live your life like you have for the past 20 months? I wouldn't. life is for living. it sucks that risks have increased but the whole point of life is to have fun 
[03:13:27] <kuudes> I can wire you 15 e in btc now
[03:14:11] <kuudes> you are a betting man. will you take it?
[03:14:39] <Betawolf> how will you collect if you're dead?
[03:14:52] <kuudes> he can wire it back to my btc account my heirs have codes to
[03:15:20] <Betawolf> and you should probably specify 'from covid'.
[03:15:38] <kuudes> hard to specify, I can halve it to 15 to 500000 $
[03:15:44] <ggreer> why would I bet such ridiculous odds? your chances of dying in the next year are way more than 0.0015%
[03:15:55] <kuudes> this year
[03:16:05] <kuudes> there is less than half a year left
[03:16:14] *** Quits: srhm (~ascii@user/srhm) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[03:16:47] <ggreer> a year is 0.15%. divide by 2 and that's 0.075%. that's 50x more than the odds you're giving
[03:16:57] <kuudes> ok. 15 to 50000
[03:17:36] <RiversHaveWings> "Inferring race from gray squares shouldn't be possible though" they weren't "gray squares"
[03:17:37] <ggreer> and obviously I'm not taking that bet. I'm not going to lock up $50k for 5 months
[03:17:46] <RiversHaveWings> A high pass filter leaves the edges in
[03:17:49] <ggreer> and I don't want you to die so I'd feel terrible if I won the bet
[03:17:57] <RiversHaveWings> They should not be showing it as a blank gray square but should instead be normalizing so the lowest value in the image is black and the highest is white.
[03:18:07] <RiversHaveWings> This would show you something that more resembles the information that the AI can see.
[03:18:14] <kuudes> no, if you won you would just keep the 15 e and be merry with me that I live
[03:18:18] <kuudes> if I die, you lose
[03:18:34] <kuudes> I am gauging what you actually believe to be my chances to die here.
[03:18:47] <kuudes> clearly it is not 0.015%
[03:19:12] <kuudes> but thank you for that information, it is useful
[03:20:19] <Betawolf> I am worried that people (+ governments) will find it really hard to stop obsessing about small ongoing covid risk they can't do much about. I underestimated the general government and societal reaction level the first time, so I don't know how much confidence to put in my belief that people will chill out soon.
[03:20:44] <kuudes> I would want the gov here to make restrictions once more, to get us to october
[03:20:55] <kuudes> then we would have about everyone willing vaccinated twice
[03:21:13] <kuudes> currently we still have vaccination queues
[03:21:55] <kuudes> so we will lose some 1000-3000 persons, ie 1/5000 - 1/2000 of population
[03:22:16] <nshepperd> bets with extreme odds are difficult. you get a better risk adjusted rate of return on pretty much anything else so it's rarely worth it
[03:22:17] <kuudes> we can still take that 1/10x down
[03:23:10] <kuudes> nshepperd, sure. though if one party is overpessimistic (me) and one party is overoptimistic (ggreer) then there may be information to be gained with money
[03:23:33] <kuudes> I would so like to know I really am overpessimistic
[03:23:35] <rmmh> Betawolf: governments move too slowly. it'll take another 6 months for them to let go of "my reelection chances depend on the case numbers"
[03:23:37] <kuudes> I guess soon I will know
[03:24:32] <Betawolf> But you have to be able to offer something as compelling as ~7% market returns for just ignoring you. A 0.015% return is worse than just leaving the money in a savings account.  
[03:25:31] <kuudes> unsure
[03:25:52] <kuudes> if we take that route, then generally betting is not useful even with perfect odds
[03:26:23] <shawwwn> two2thehead: "I apologize for the delayed response. I just realized that I never hit send on my email."
[03:26:25] <kuudes> because betting does not produce in itself profit, the money is at the table, it does not accrue interest
[03:26:26] <quanticle> gwern, Obormot\Arcturus: https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/07/the-dangerous-ideas-of-longtermism-and-existential-risk

[03:26:51] <kuudes> quanticle, yeah, I saw that, it seems like a sneerclub piece
[03:26:56] <Jayson_Virissimo> Very dangerous looking blokes
[03:27:02] <kuudes> unsure if it is useful to spread toxo
[03:27:11] <two2thehead> shawwwn, lol
[03:27:21] <two2thehead> I feel bad for laughing
[03:27:22] <nshepperd> current sneer club affairs
[03:27:44] <quanticle> It's very sneerclub
[03:27:45] <shawwwn> two2thehead: as a bonus, it was a rejection email. Just kidding, I'm talking with some director of engineering next. But it would be funnier as a rejection
[03:27:49] <quanticle> That's why it's funny
[03:28:17] <kuudes> they seem to have very high stakes on hiring you, shawwwn
[03:28:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Oh no
[03:28:22] <Betawolf> The issue is the lack of reward affects the recovery of information. If I put up tuppence on a bet that aliens will invade within a year, and offer odds that ask you to wager 100k, there's no reason for you to take that bet even if you think the odds are accurately reflected, because keeping that money around is more of an inconvenience to you than the possible return.
[03:28:35] <kuudes> I mean, how much work hours have they already burned just in ascertaining you are good
[03:29:12] <shawwwn> kuudes: eh, that's part of the process of finding decent people.
[03:29:13] <kuudes> why would you keep the money in better credit class than you are yourself
[03:29:15] <kuudes> that is costly
[03:29:30] <kuudes> if the other party has bet with you, surely they accept your credit risk
[03:29:40] <shawwwn> keeping money in better credit classes is how you find better candidates
[03:29:40] <kuudes> they have not demanded any collateral or anything
[03:29:47] <shawwwn> the credit risk is inversely proportional to their talent
[03:30:00] <kuudes> shawwwn, it was to Betawolf
[03:30:06] <nshepperd> lol
[03:30:16] <kuudes> sorry
[03:30:25] <shawwwn> if a candidate demands collateral, it tends to be a good sign that negotiations are proceeding well
[03:30:34] <pompolic> i think this is just my brain telling me things, but i kind of feel like the sneerclub is losing
[03:30:55] <RiversHaveWings> ...What have they done lately
[03:31:11] <pompolic> i don't keep up, I'm using it as a stand-in for the style of cognition
[03:31:16] <RiversHaveWings> Oh
[03:32:02] <kuudes> Betawolf, ie if you don't expect your total to fall under the desider level, surely you don't need to alter your investment portfolio
[03:32:06] <PapuaHardyNet> "if a candidate demands collateral" shawwn, what do you mean by collateral here
[03:32:14] <kuudes> ie in the unlikely event that you lose, you just pay out from your general equity
[03:32:18] <nshepperd> there's also the fact that 100k is more than 50m x as much utility as 2 cents, because of the logarithmic utility of money
[03:32:38] <nshepperd> so bets tend to work better when all the numbers are small
[03:33:02] <kuudes> doesn't the logarithmic utility mean that larger amounts of money are less useful than linearly predicted?
[03:33:09] <kuudes> but the small money side has accepted that
[03:33:10] <PapuaHardyNet> so is collateral equity?
[03:33:14] <nshepperd> no
[03:33:42] <kuudes> ln(100_000) < 50_000_000*ln(0.02)
[03:33:46] <PapuaHardyNet> is collateral renumeration for time of the candidate spent in negotiating an offer?
[03:33:55] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, no. it was confusion
[03:34:00] <Betawolf> kuudes: I was struggling to understand you but I think I do now. You mean the money should still be mine somehow no matter what, so I can sell my house or whatever? The issue is if I would've decided that I really like hookers and blow and/or hot stock tips instead of imbalanced bets.
[03:34:00] <kuudes> ignore that discussion.
[03:34:07] <PapuaHardyNet> very well
[03:34:21] <nshepperd> specifically, losing 100k is more than 50M x of gaining 2 cents
[03:35:09] <nshepperd> if your net worth is exactly 100k then it would be -inf utility
[03:35:17] <PlanckWalk> Ehhh
[03:35:30] <nshepperd> (under the logarithmic model)
[03:35:37] <PlanckWalk> I'm pretty sure that having zero net worth is not infinitely bad
[03:35:51] <PlanckWalk> Oh.  Why are you using such a model?
[03:36:01] <nshepperd> it's a good approximation
[03:36:08] <PlanckWalk> It's a terrible approximation
[03:36:12] <nshepperd> wrong
[03:36:35] <gwern> quanticle: I read torres's draft a year ago or so. it's dumb and despite his pretense of research, he fucks up several citations
[03:36:44] <PlanckWalk> Being concave is fine.  Having a singularity at 0 net worth is a terrible approximation.
[03:37:21] <PlanckWalk> Otherwise you conclude things like "poor people should be killed for their own good"
[03:37:30] <nshepperd> no
[03:37:42] <rmmh> does climate change count as x-risk
[03:37:45] <quanticle> gwern: How did you manage to read his draft a year ago?
[03:37:54] <Betawolf> rmmh: no, but it's still bad.
[03:38:03] <gwern> quanticle: there's a pdf somewhere which got posted to /r/thisisthewayitwillbe, iirc
[03:38:11] <quanticle> rmmh: It depends on whether there is a runaway process that leads to the Earth turning into Venus.
[03:38:19] <kuudes> eu has now strictly better vaccination coverage than usa apparently
[03:38:30] <gwern> I haven't read this current affairs version, but it being CA I assume it will be bad for my blood pressure to read the CA version on top of torres's original faux-scholarly one
[03:38:37] <kuudes> ie larger fraction of population 1 dosed and larger fraction of population 2 dosed
[03:38:45] <kuudes> still lacking from uk level though
[03:38:51] <quanticle> gwern: Yeah, fair enough
[03:38:56] <PlanckWalk> There isn't such a runaway process, not on the scale that we can reach by burning fossil fuels anyway.
[03:39:13] <rmmh> climate change is finally affecting me

[03:44:01] <ggreer> you're welcome

[03:46:08] <kuudes> hmm. does owid have old data or is there some disrepancy?
[03:46:19] <kuudes> how many percents of us population is currently 1 dosed? how many 2 dosed?
[03:46:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[03:46:45] <gwern> catern: we aren't very elite, but starspawn0 is sorta like a neurosciencey gwern

[03:47:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> This seems obvious to me
[03:47:03] <Robomot> COVID-19 Data Explorer - Our World in Data (Research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems)
[03:47:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But, conversely, ignoring climate change because its effects are miniscule in the grand scheme of things mostly does make sense)
[03:48:09] <PlanckWalk> No, it doesn't.
[03:48:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why not
[03:49:01] <PlanckWalk> Because it is still likely to have large effects on any scale that matters to current human civilization.
[03:49:21] <ggreer> kuudes: one is adults. one is total population
[03:49:36] <nshepperd> ai will kill us all before climate change does
[03:50:09] <PlanckWalk> Just because we're one group of upright apes on an insignificant dot about a glowing speck in an enormous universe doesn't mean that we don't matter to us.
[03:50:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Large compared to what? Bostrom's point is that this is precisely *not* the case
[03:50:13] <gwern> (climate change will not kill us all to begin with)
[03:50:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Like, what you just said is a total non sequitur, because none of the longtermisms are disputing that
[03:50:50] <kuudes> ggreer, https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7tlsEQXoAQZQeX?format=jpg&name=large and https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7pHOdhXsAcRTIc?format=jpg&name=large don't seem to be equivalent? which of them is true?

[03:51:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Take what I said against a background of assuming that value is value to humans, etc.
[03:51:18] <kuudes> ggreer, ah, yeah, that makes sense (adults vs population)
[03:51:19] <PlanckWalk> What you're saying is the non-sequitur
[03:51:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> -_-
[03:51:32] <ggreer> oh and those second images are all stats versus just delta variant
[03:51:49] <PlanckWalk> Just because there are large-scale things worth considering doesn't mean that anything smaller scale should be ignored.
[03:51:55] <kuudes> so on delta we are only protected from death by 24x?
[03:51:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Ok I think you're just mentally rounding off what I'm saying to the nearest cliche you can think of... no point in continuing this until you stop doing that
[03:52:26] <kuudes> 24x is good but it is much less than 417x
[03:52:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: I mean, did you even click on the link? Do you know what Bostrom's argument is? I'm guessing no
[03:53:15] <PlanckWalk> Yes, I did click on the link, I have read a fair bit of Bostrom's stuff.
[03:53:36] <kuudes> I guess my preference would be somewhere around 100x
[03:53:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: So you disagree with his economic argument? Which numbers do you dispute, specifically? Or what is your disagreement?
[03:55:12] <PlanckWalk> I disagree with the bald assertion that short-run effects are independent of long-run effects.
[03:55:14] <ggreer> kuudes: I assume an age breakdown would show that only super old vaccinated people die of covid
[03:55:26] <ggreer> IIRC the average age of death for breakthrough cases was around 82
[03:55:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Who asserted that?
[03:55:29] <kuudes> they are about 2/3 of deaths, yes
[03:55:38] <kuudes> but 1/3 is still <70
[03:55:49] <ggreer> which is much higher than the average unvaccinated death age of early 70s
[03:56:44] <kuudes> https://i.imgur.com/YvXznMI.png is the cases per death over age as observed in finland
[03:57:07] <kuudes> the open question is how many unobserved cases we have had. a decent guess is that we have observed about 1/3 of true cases
[03:57:25] <ggreer> I guarantee that phil torres (and those who agree with him) would prefer that all of humanity die on earth if the alternative is "everyone on earth dies, but people with differing political views manage to colonize space"
[03:57:34] <kuudes> it could be as low as 1/7 in extreme, but also is not better than 1/1.5
[03:58:04] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Depends on whether you consider second order effects: https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1422689848012550146 Interesting hypothesis
[03:58:04] <|dbotdan> Rob Lee (@RALee85, 2021-08-03 22:44): ‘I would bet failed responses to environmental crises caused by climate change will be one of the most likely causes for political leaders to lose power in the future.’
[03:58:24] <kuudes> basicly factor of 3 moves it up by half a square, because 3^2 ~ 10
[03:58:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Ok, look at the word "fulfilling" on that CA page and tell me if you agree: I think "fu" should be a ligature
[03:58:57] <gwern> I refuse, CA is a memetic weapon
[03:58:58] <quanticle> I mean, I want to say eff you as classily as possible, so of course I think "fu" should be a ligature
[03:59:01] <kuudes> and 24 moves it up by 1 square and then little less than half a square
[03:59:13] <nshepperd> the risk of politics caused by climate change is something that certainly could interfere with immanentization of the eschaton
[03:59:41] <kuudes> climate change will cause politics because everything will cause politics though?
[03:59:44] <gwern> (and I expect I would disagree because I've hated every 'fu' ligature I've seen to date except in display fonts meant to be unreadable; outside fancy display fonts, I regard them as a 'fu' to the reader)
[03:59:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: ... hmm, hard to say. On the one hand, politicans don't lose power all that often these days, so what even are the base rates?
[04:00:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Wait, where have you seen an 'fu' ligature?? I've never seen it!
[04:00:06] <nshepperd> like if all the microchip factories got nuked or something
[04:00:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or have I? None come to mind...)
[04:00:19] <kuudes> ggreer, but if you sum about 1.5 squares and 0.5 squares you get about 2 squares
[04:00:25] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: dunno but I hate the idea the same way I hate 'fi'
[04:00:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> whoa whoa whoa
[04:00:58] <kuudes> and if you go from age 40 in the chart, you will end up then to about 100000 cases per death
[04:01:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why do you hate 'fi'
[04:01:29] <kuudes> which is 1/100_000 or 0.001%
[04:01:34] <nshepperd> PTSD from all the text mutilation in pdfs caused by ligatures
[04:01:48] <gwern> it is too unfamiliar and the loop people tend to use really sticks out
[04:01:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... loop??
[04:02:35] <kuudes> I guess. I hope it is that way
[04:02:37] <pompolic> is that what having a parse error feels like
[04:02:53] <kuudes> yeah, it could be

[04:07:29] <adiabatic> speaking of needing JS: did you know that img lazy loading only works if you have JS enabled? It's for anti-tracking purposes.

[04:07:47] <gwern> oh, fallback
[04:07:48] <kuudes> yeah, I guess being exposed to covid is little less than 3 weeks for me
[04:08:05] <shawwwn> I told Emily I got rejected and she joked she was gonna quit in protest lol
[04:08:17] <gwern> shawwwn: aw. did they say why?
[04:08:28] <kuudes> and without vaccines it would be 72 weeks, or more than 1 year then
[04:08:40] <shawwwn> They never say why. But I’m actually meeting with the director of engineering next
[04:08:49] <quanticle> adiabatic: Huh? Why would image lazy loading require Javascript to avoid tracking?
[04:09:00] <quanticle> Unless I'm misunderstanding what you're saying.
[04:09:12] <shawwwn> I wonder how long till she figures it out…
[04:09:25] <adiabatic> because you can track about how far people get through an article if you can tell what images one particular IP address loads and when
[04:09:25] <gwern> quanticle: well, you'd be able to track JS-less scrolls through the page based on the image requests

[04:09:38] <PlanckWalk> Obormot\Arcturus: The argument that says "we can ignore little considerations like collapse of civilization, because one day there will be 10^50+ people who matter more" is based on it.

[04:09:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> What a name
[04:10:03] <adiabatic> quanticle: but if you have JS enabled, you can do that anyway with intersection observers and other shenanigans
[04:10:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Which is not the argument I was talking about, so that's completely irrelevant
[04:10:23] <PlanckWalk> Obormot\Arcturus: Which one are you talking about?
[04:10:26] <nshepperd> my favourite ligature is 'ffi', as in 'insu cient'
[04:10:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> -_-
[04:10:32] <nshepperd> thanks pdfs
[04:10:35] <gwern> lol :(
[04:10:37] <PlanckWalk> That's the one referenced in the linked article.
[04:10:38] <adiabatic> ahahahahahhaha
[04:10:47] <quanticle> Ah, okay. So in this case, disabling JS is a signal that you don't want to be tracked, so they disable other things that could be used to track you even without JS. With JS, it's lol gg, so who cares?
[04:10:58] <adiabatic> quanticle: exactly
[04:11:31] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: if I were 10 or 15 years younger, I'd probably take this list and set up a script to auto-replace all those words with the ligature form :)
[04:11:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: The article in fact references two different arguments, only one of which is that one...
[04:11:34] <adiabatic> I mean, I think I've used lazy loading only like once in my life
[04:12:04] <adiabatic> but it's a magnificently appropriate use 
[04:12:11] <gwern> and then look for excuses to... /squint talk about 'scarabæoid' a lot
[04:12:13] <quanticle> nshepperd: Insu cient? No, no, I assure you, our PDFs are quite sa sfactory
[04:13:23] <nshepperd> e typography is perfectly ne, I'm sure
[04:13:40] * gwern is having ashbacks now
[04:14:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: In any case there is no "bald assertion" as you said, regardless of which argument you mean; it makes very little sense to say you disagree with a "bald assertion", then reveal that actually you're just inferring things from *other* things that are actually said (never mind that you also got the things that are actually said *wrong*)

[07:09:33] <quanticle> Nah, oolong wouldn't have missed that rabbit
[07:09:42] <rmmh> the angle was bad
[07:10:11] <gwern> I'm not sure. cats are very grayscaled vision and hyperfocused on movement. they don't *need* to detect a static rabbit because they'd've been watching it for the past hour planning their stalk or ambush
[07:10:15] <nshepperd> feep: amazing
[07:10:18] <quanticle> Anyway, I'm surprised you could get that close to the rabbit without it bolting

[07:13:34] <quanticle> I should get a real camera
[07:15:02] <rmmh> the first two videos are just a pixel 5
[07:15:22] <rmmh> but a proper tele lens is crucial for animals :3
[07:15:39] <rmmh> the last video is shot from about 10 feet away, through a window
[07:15:39] * quanticle has a Pixel 3A. The camera is good but not great
[07:15:51] <rmmh> I don't think the camera materially changed from the 3A to the 5
[07:16:22] <quanticle> Hmmm... I guess I just need to practice my Elmer Fudd skills then
[07:16:30] <quanticle> To stawk the wabbits
[07:17:09] <gwern> the last video is pretty impressive. that uses a tele lens on a pixel 5?
[07:17:37] <rmmh> err, no, the last video is a fuji xt-3 with the 50-200mm lens and a crop from 4k to 1080p
[07:18:51] <gwern> aw. and here I was thinking smartphones had gotten OP and hax
[07:20:17] <rmmh> talking about zoom is irritating, "5x zoom" is just the ratio from the minimum to the maximum focal length. photographers generally convert the focal lenths to what the equivalent would be on a full-frame camera and use that instead
[07:21:37] <rmmh> large sensors are still king for low light, video, and shallow depth of field, but smartphones are better for basically everything else
[07:24:02] <PlanckWalk> Long focal lengths reduce light levels, so I guess that means large sensors perform better there too.
[07:29:13] <rmmh> right, but it's all square-cube law. light gathering follows the square of the sensor diameter, but the lens weight (~= cost) follows the cube
[07:30:34] <rmmh> you *can* buy tele lenses that have as much light as much shorter ones, but they are huge https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS589x442~articles/3133419616/lens01.jpeg

If treatment worked, he said, it was because patients were chosen for their good prognosis and
[09:05:30] <nshepperd2> were given special treatment: "insulin patients tend to be an elite group sharing common privileges and perils".[16] Prior to publishing "The insulin myth" in The Lancet, Bourne had tried to submit the article to the Journal of Mental Science; after a 12-month delay, the Journal informed Bourne they had rejected the article, telling him to "get

[09:06:03] <quanticle> Well, "engineering and logistics" is just another way of saying "physics", to be honest. Oil and gas drilling rigs can drill fast because they have to make a hole that's like a meter across. Given that the volume of material to be removed goes up by the *square* of the cross sectional area of the hole, it's no surprise that oil and gas drilling rigs can move much faster than TBMs. They simply

[12:41:50] <kuudes> hmm. would it be sane if the vaccination leader here would be driving the population to get infected after getting vaccinated, so that people would have also infection provided immunity with lower death price in order to counter lambda and later variants that breach vaccination protection?
[12:49:40] <dbohdan> kuudes: Something I'd consider is, how does infection after vaccination affect the antibody count curve?  Could it speed up the decline in the number of antibodies somehow?
[12:52:56] <nshepperd2> that seems like a quite bad idea
[12:54:19] <nshepperd2> for one thing, deliberately infecting vaccinated people would encourage variants to evolve

[13:03:14] <nshepperd2> also, depending on how much individual variation there is in immune response, the benefit is less than you would assume. in the extreme case, 80% of people are almost fully protected and gain no benefit, while 20% of people are not protected at all and gain all the usual risk

[14:47:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Whatever the reason, the burger from Washington D.C.'s Good Stuff Eatery was at once quite tasty, and soul-crushingly, maddeningly, frustratingly terrible. Like a child star who ends up doing second-rate sitcoms his whole life, Good Stuff's offense is its failure to fulfill its potential. "
[14:48:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I want to start by saying that I'm well aware that nothing I say here is going to stop the massive crush of lines that form at this place. It's in an awesome location, it's a reasonable value for the neighborhood, and fact is, in the end, the burger is quite tasty—salty and beefy, with some nice fresh toppings. But what destroys Good Stuff for me is a combination of a total lack of soul and care, coupled with some of the

[22:32:21] <two2thehead> dbohdan, nitpick, that's insulting to droids and it doesn't fully capture the cruelty and narcissism of these people
[22:32:58] <two2thehead> my first impression is that droids and middle management are categorically closer

[22:48:17] <Obormot\Gaia> nshepperd, Ralith: Ok, suggestions wanted: I decided to tweak my shepherd salad a bit, by (a) using cherry tomatoes, and (b) adding some fresh cranberries. (a) worked great and I 100% recommend it (if you can get good ones), but as for (b), it was good but left the flavors unbalanced; I feel like the result needs some sweet and/or something else to balance out the sour of the cranberries. I could just increase the amount of
[22:48:18] <Obormot\Gaia>  bell pepper, but that seems crude ... any ideas?
[22:50:08] <Ralith> I don't have much experience with shepherd's salad, but cranberries are really sweet
[22:50:13] <Ralith> I wonder if you actually need more acid
[22:50:55] <gwern> fresh cranberries are really sweet? I thought they were bitter and you had to add a ton of sugar to make them palatable straight
