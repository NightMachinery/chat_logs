[00:06:06] <mycroftiv> this topic of ultrafilters and model production and formalization can seem really abstract, but id actually like to find useful applications to productive computational algorithms, which I think are implicit in the Moerdihk/Palmgren work
[00:06:56] <mycroftiv> *Moerdijk. Because its constructive mathematics, the production of the nonstandard models should be computationally effective so you should have computationally usable 'infinitesimals' and/or nonstandard naturals
[00:07:14] <Cale> I don't really know the context, but won't all the computable ultrafilters be principal?
[00:07:43] <mycroftiv> cale: technically its not ultrafilters, its just filters, it gets to the same place, is what Moerdijk and others proved
[00:07:51] <Cale> ah, interesting
[00:08:14] <mycroftiv> Moerdijk and Palmgren showed you can do an intuitionistic version of the classical ultrafilter based construction in the category of filters
[00:08:25] <mycroftiv> thats what im trying to formalize
[00:08:48] <mycroftiv> the constructive analog of the classical nonstandard models of arithmetic or nonstandard analysis that use nonconstructive ultrafilters
[00:09:35] <mycroftiv> which are well expressed in papers by Moerdijk and Palmgren with sheaf techniques that ought to translate to agda but its not easy for me
[00:10:56] <mycroftiv> in theory i have a fairly complete formalization of the basic setup of the category and its morphisms but i have gotten aspects of it wrong and fixed them several times already and the actual production of real models is a lot more elaborate

[02:17:18] <dude12312414> if you're asking if every C^infty function has a Taylor series with nonzero radius of convergence at each of its points, then that's not true
[02:18:19] <dude12312414> the classic counter-example is the function f(x) = e^{-1/x^2} (x != 0) and f(0) = 0.
[02:18:56] <dude12312414> oops
[02:19:25] <Ethos> No, no, my question is if, given g(t) a C^infty function such that g(0) = 0, can I conclude that h(t) = g(t)/t if t=!0 and g'(0) in t=0 is C^infty written down g(t) using the taylor's theorem I linked.
[02:19:27] <dude12312414> actually what i should have said is that the Taylor series does not necessarily converge to f
[02:19:48] <Ethos> This has nothing to do with analiticy of functions (even if it sounds like it).
[02:20:07] <Ethos> analyticity*
[02:21:11] <Z-module> I think it's possible for f to be C^infty at some x_0, but its Taylor series at x_0 is divergent?
[02:21:25] <Ethos> http://mathb.in/69287
[02:21:32] <Ethos> That's the precise statement.
[02:21:45] <PlanckWalk> Z-module: It's Taylor series at x_0 is just f(x_0)
[02:21:55] <dude12312414> well at x0 the taylor series always converges since the higher order terms are all 0
[02:22:00] <Ethos> Yeah.
[02:22:31] <Ethos> The anwser I saw for that question uses the taylor's theorem to conclude that h is C^infty but i am not sure if it makes sense.
[02:22:33] <dude12312414> Ethos: ah okay
[02:22:43] <dude12312414> that sounds plausible
[02:23:10] <dude12312414> not sure you can use taylor's theorem to prove it in generality though
[02:23:10] <Ethos> I am just trying to see if an answer I've seen makes sense, i already solved that statement with a different approach.
[02:23:23] <Z-module> I meant for *some* f

[02:24:30] <Z-module> right
[02:24:34] <PlanckWalk> The Taylor series will be about some other point.
[02:24:35] <Z-module> just at x_0 itself

[04:18:27] <isekaijin> I'm talking nonsense, sorry.
[04:18:33] <isekaijin> I was thinking of a cell decomposition.

[04:20:00] <rex> can't we just use the hypercubes?
[04:20:12] <isekaijin> You can, but you need to do a little bit more work.
[04:20:26] <isekaijin> Your faces are *cubes*, not simplices.
[04:20:44] <isekaijin> So you need to split them into simplices, which you can do.
[04:21:03] <rex> ah
[04:21:22] <rex> so a square itself would also be not a simplex
[04:21:37] <isekaijin> When I said “square”, I meant just the perimeter.

[04:57:30] <isekaijin> rex: Okay. Consider the map F : R^3 -> R^4 given by F(x,y,z) = (x^2 - y^2, xy, xz, yz). Notice that, for any p = (x,y,z) \in R^3, we have F(p) = F(-p).
[04:58:33] <rex> ok
[04:58:39] <isekaijin> Now let S^2 be the Euclidean unit sphere in R^3, and let f be the restriction of F to S^2.
[04:59:20] <isekaijin> Since f(p) = f(-p) for any p \in S^2, then f : S^2 -> R^4 actually factors through RP^2, i.e., it can be expressed as a composition of maps S^2 -> RP^2 -> R^4.
[04:59:55] <isekaijin> Show that the resulting map RP^2 -> R^4 is an embedding.

[20:14:11] <Gurkenglas> ...on reflection, "map every c to the ways to consume a c" does deserve to have the ^op more on the C side than the Set side.

[20:17:10] <olspookishmagus> hello, I'm passing this: (x+7)^((x+7)^2) to derivative calculator and I'm being shown a "generalized power rule" as a step: http://mathb.in/69297
[20:18:09] <sedeki> olspookishmagus you mean the chain rule
[20:18:14] <olspookishmagus> is this... really a thing? I haven't seen it in many cheat sheets
[20:19:24] <Gurkenglas> olspookishmagus, when you change x, how much does u^v change? it's the change in u^v that passes through u plus the change in u^v that passes through v.
[20:20:40] <olspookishmagus> yeah that's what I thought that this must be a special version of the chain rule
[20:21:33] <PJBoy> d/dx f(x)^g(x) = dx/x exp(ln(f(x)) g(x)) = exp(ln(f(x)) g(x)) d/dx ln(f(x)) g(x)

[20:31:10] <mycroftiv> gurkenglas: there is a lot of math studying the possibility of exhaustive enumeration of proofs, it is a very interesting space but Turing and Gödel as well as practical combinatorial explosion of possibilities limit things
[20:32:35] <mycroftiv> the most relevant results to your thinking are probably proof theory using ordinal analysis and aspects of reverse mathematics
[20:33:56] <mycroftiv> assessing how strong different systems need to be to prove things, using a stronger system to prove consistency of a weaker one. the proof via ordinal induction up to E_0 that peano arithmetic is consistent is a starting place

[21:17:44] <Decker> mycroftiv that's pretty much the point; although it doesn't produce the same outputs... they're actually the right outputs not approximations...  And offers other features... like getting a difference between two orienttions or rotational velocities
[21:18:39] <Decker> if it was the same old complex stuff; I wouldn't be quite so motivated... ya know if it was the same thing with just different sin(a)sin(b)cos(c) sort of combinations where you still work in some abstract linear coordinate system

[21:19:42] <Decker> like I mean sure - I could say axis-angle is 2 angles that define an axis and then the direction around that... and move the normal of the vector to two angles, and the length of the vector as the third - it's just shuffling numbers
[21:20:26] <Decker> mycroftiv I have picked up that I seem to be conveying disagreement
[21:22:12] <mycroftiv> decker: if you demonstrate  that you understand the usual system, and you arent claiming that usual math & physics is somehow wrong in a quantitative way, you are just proposing what you think is a better system for notation and calculation

[21:25:16] <mycroftiv> i have no idea, im just talking about general presentation so people grasp what you are doing and why, its really simpler than a specific issue of that hopf fibration, just providing a summary that is simpler and more direct
[21:25:33] <Decker> (there is that one tiny hook 'lnQexp(q) -> {quaternion}'   ... which is used to emit the rotations to existing libraries...
[21:25:43] <mycroftiv> i may be wrong about all this, i just empathize with the struggle to do work and present it and have other people understand
[21:26:19] <Decker> you've mentioned some points I can address... I'm just sort of hashing how how

[21:28:39] <mycroftiv> its a lot like

[21:29:03] <Decker> 'general presentaion' hey I'm rotating things- like quaternions or matrices - only not at all.... so I more see saying anything about those things 1) insults the intelligence of the reader 2) doesn't offer a lot of insight them 3) doesn't offer anything other thna parroting(?) I dunno.. like because of (2) there's no insights to be gleamed from eeither of those
[21:29:20] <Decker> and trying to say this comes from either is wrong... they are the shadow on the wall... but see
[21:29:31] <mycroftiv> well, it may be the readers just need to learn more and try harder
[21:29:33] <Decker> I realize that's not the standard.
[21:30:04] <mycroftiv> but overall its just hard to be understood even if you are trying as hard as you can to be simple and clear, if the topic is technical
[21:31:33] <mycroftiv> especially if you have any non-conventional viewpoint or framework, and you hope to convince people its worth investigating an alternative to something they already know, or youd like them to learn your system vs the usual

[21:46:01] <Decker> that was in 2015 July
[21:46:03] <Gurkenglas> Is there any reason not to think of a vector space as an algebra of the monad ((_->R)->R)? (where the (_->R)->R is linear)
[21:47:33] <Decker> I don't see one?
[21:47:38] <mycroftiv> in theory shouldnt we always think of mathematical objects as being simultaneously every formally valid description of them, that we can manage to simultaneously remember and apply? :)
[21:48:20] <mycroftiv> sometimes all of math seems like just providing 500,000,000 names for what you can do with integers
[21:49:02] <Gurkenglas> (it's a *little* different: you can take any finite linear combination of vectors, but also an infinite linear combination so long as the coefficients don't add up to infinity)

[21:53:11] <isekaijin> Because v -  v + v - v + ... is an infinite linear combination where the coefficients (1, -1, 1, -1, ...) don't add up to infinity.
[21:54:13] *** Joins: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@87.227.196.109)
[21:54:24] <Gurkenglas> isekaijin, yeah absolute values, so the (_->R)->R always outputs something finite
[21:54:25] <isekaijin> And, if this is the case, is there any good reason to favor the 1-norm so much? Why not consider linear combinations where the sum of squares of the coefficients is bounded instead?
[21:56:41] <Gurkenglas> the _->R interprets every point as some finite number of your choice before they're added up; if every negative coefficient's point is interpreted as -1 and every positive coefficient's point as 1, then that's the sum of absolute values and no other interpretation can go to infinity
[21:56:57] <isekaijin> In any case, no idea how a computer scientist looks at things, but for most other people who use math, vector spaces arise primarily as geometric objects, e.g., tangent planes to submanifolds of R^n.

[21:58:37] <Gurkenglas> it's not like i don't get to use my visual cortex :)! the -> perspective results in lots of diagrams.
[21:58:46] <isekaijin> So a good *definition* of vector space should emphasize the geometric intuition, and only secondarily maybe use some abstract nonsense, only to the extent that it's actually helpful.
[21:59:31] <Gurkenglas> too many abstract-nonsense papers have too many letters and too few pictures.
[21:59:47] <Gurkenglas> words are fine, i'm talking about the equations.
[22:02:03] <int-e> Vector spaces should work without bases. So that's an argument against ((_ -> F) -> F) stuff.

[22:03:43] <int-e> okay now it's getting circular, where do you get a set of vectors from?
[22:04:50] <int-e> One fault here is that you really need a vector space structure *before* you can speak about linearity.
[22:05:23] <Decker> in what context? is there a context?
[22:05:29] <Decker> is it because it's context free?
[22:05:40] <Gurkenglas> int-e, take any set V. equip it with an algebra ((V->F)->F)->V. that is, it should map dirac distributions to the spike and send a ((((V->F)->F)->F)->F) to the same V either of the two possible ways.
[22:06:00] <Gurkenglas> this enforces linearity
[22:06:53] <riv> any basis is equally valid

[22:08:59] <Gurkenglas> V->F is any function. (V->F)->F is required to be linear in the usual ring sense.
[22:09:41] <Gurkenglas> if you like you can require everything to be continuous and then you get slightly different, but still sensible results.
[22:09:47] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: How does it even help to say that “a vector space is an algebra for some seemingly random monad”?
[22:10:04] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: i was making an entirely general comment and NOT endorsing that specific comment whatsoever
[22:10:07] <isekaijin> I mean, it seems like a cool observation, but why would anyone sensible want to use that as the *definition* of vector space?
[22:10:31] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: isnt it just 'A definition' not 'THE definition' ?
[22:10:38] <isekaijin> If a definition of vector spaces is unusable for constructing Grassmannians and vector bundles, then it's useless.
[22:10:57] <Gurkenglas> isekaijin, then i can produce other cool observations to explain the likes of why entropy involves a logarithm, and then i can swap out parts of the construction without everything else breaking.

[22:13:47] <Gurkenglas> mycroftiv, even worse: i expect my definition is *slightly different* and can do whatever those are anyway
[22:13:53] <Gurkenglas> aka not isomorphic
[22:14:31] <int-e> Gurkenglas: have you proved that this actually works as a definition?
[22:14:42] <int-e> I don't understand how this is supposed to work at all.
[22:14:49] <int-e> This may be a me problem, of course.
[22:16:01] <Gurkenglas> int-e, i mean, you sure can write turn every such ((V->F)->F)->V into a vector-space-as-usual V.
[22:16:05] <Gurkenglas> -write
[22:16:20] <int-e> But I thought I did understand how (B -> F) ->_{lin} F would correspond to F^B.
[22:17:10] <int-e> I'm also not sure I care since I have an understanding of vector spaces that works without all this (abstract) nonsense... maybe I should just stop participating in the discussion.
[22:17:33] <isekaijin> I'm going to say (even more explicitly) what I've been (not so subtly) implying for a while. I'm annoyed by the attitude of programmers, especially Haskell programmers, who learn a little bit of mathematics, and then think that the entirety of mathematics has to be redefined to suit the little bit that they know.
[22:18:02] <Gurkenglas> isekaijin, so Gr(k,V) is the linear injections from R^k into V. What structure would you like on that space?
[22:18:20] <isekaijin> There's a lot more to mathematics than what can be expressed in Haskell, or even Haskell + <fantasy extension that not even GHC has>.
[22:18:41] <isekaijin> Gurkenglas: It has to be an algebraic variety, or a manifold if the ground field is R or C.
[22:18:56] <Gurkenglas> i havent done haskell for years, this is from category theory
[22:19:23] <Gurkenglas> (uhh, probably i read some small amounts of haskell in there.)
[22:19:31] <isekaijin> Gurkenglas: You also have to get the canonical vector bundle that, to each point of Gr(k, V), assigns the corresponding vector subspace of V.
[22:19:35] <Gurkenglas> (there = those years)
[22:20:30] <isekaijin> If the ground field is C, I would like to easily construct the obvious Kähler structure on Gr(k, V).
[22:20:51] <Gurkenglas> isekaijin, presumably one does R^k because that gets you all the injections so long as V is itself finite-dimensional. If V is infinite-dimensional do you also want the infinite-dimensional subspaces?

[22:22:34] <isekaijin> So, to avoid trouble, I would say that k has to be finite, even though we might allow V to be infinite-dimensional.
[22:23:16] <isekaijin> I'm not merely trying to find cool redefinitions. I actually want to compute geometrically useful stuff like Chern classes.
[22:23:29] <Gurkenglas> ah you'd like to be able to say everything about a space in terms of smaller spaces, without fixed-point business.

[22:27:02] <Z-module> and there are always 2^|B| = 2^dim(V) = |Pow(B)| such distinct subsets B'
[22:27:25] <Gurkenglas> more weakly held prediction: these troubles arise because you can only have finite linear combinations with the usual definition and my definition, which provides a notion of infinite linear combination, helps.
[22:28:05] <isekaijin> Gurkenglas: Oftentimes a geometric problem can, after some amount of work, be rephrased as “Can we find sections of this vector bundle satisfying such and such algebraic properties?”
[22:28:50] <isekaijin> For example, “Is a manifold orientable?” is equivalent to “Can we find a nowhere zero section of the determinant bundle of the (co)tangent bundle?”
[22:28:57] <Gurkenglas> isekaijin, the wikipedia page on Kähler structure gives multiple pieces of structure that I'd have to construct - pick on, please?
[22:29:03] <Gurkenglas> *one
[22:29:35] <Gurkenglas> (or did i misread and any one of the three works)
[22:30:10] <isekaijin> Any two, and the third can be recovered from those two.
[22:31:14] <isekaijin> But, in any case, my point is that linear algebra is used for more serious things than merely contemplating the beauty of something a vector space.
[22:31:20] <int-e> Wait, is this supposed to model a double dual? If so, both arrows in (V -> F) -> F need to be linear, and it'll only work (algebraically) in the finite-dimensional case, or (with continuity) for Hilbert spaces.
[22:32:07] <int-e> (And then linearity of the first arrow poses the problem that you need a vector space structure on V before you even start.)

[22:33:39] <int-e> I'm really skeptical about that right now.
[22:33:51] <Gurkenglas> that's true for any monad.
[22:34:16] <isekaijin> What's the “double dual” for an arbitrary monad to begin wtih?
[22:34:23] <Gurkenglas> but let me draw up that diagram, in case i made a mistake.
[22:34:57] <isekaijin> The notion of “double dual” makes sense in some categories like the category of vector spaces / modules, but not in others.
[22:35:15] <Gurkenglas> isekaijin, the double dual is the monad :) ((V->F)->F)->V says "go from V** to V"
[22:35:56] <int-e> You also have to show that you actually get a monad structure for ((_ -> F) -> F) when "->" is "linear maps".
[22:39:25] <isekaijin> Gurkenglas: Now that I think about it, if you require vector spaces to be isomorphic to their double dual, then do you even have enough vector spaces for all linear maps to have a well-defined kernel?
[22:40:07] <isekaijin> Note that not having enough kernels is a serious problem.
[22:40:29] <[itchyjunk]> I wonder if I have arithmophobia.
[22:40:40] <isekaijin> We pass from the category of vector bundles to the category of sheaves of modules to *fix* the issue of not having enough kernels.
[22:41:48] <isekaijin> (Not enough kernels or cokernels means that the usual tools from homological algebra are not available, and how are you going to tackle hard problems while being so handicapped?)

[23:22:32] <int-e> yes, you're doing double duals. what you're not doing is to define a vector space.
[23:23:34] <int-e> Because V is already an F-vectorspace before you can properly talk about the (V -> F) -> F part.

[23:50:41] <int-e> You still haven't defined a single thing at this point. You're picking known fields and vector spaces and pick an element from ((V -> F) -> F) -> V that happens to be a bijection and linear. Which is just the double dual (for cases where it produces an isomorphic space) in action.
