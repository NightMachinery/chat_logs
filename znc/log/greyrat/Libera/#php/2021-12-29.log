[01:11:20] <impliednude> anyone know of a bypass for magento2.4.x install without having elasticsearch. it screws up the install, even when there is a proper remote instance.
[01:14:49] <da_wunder> most likely just wrong credentials or you cannot access that from magento server
[01:17:48] <impliednude> da_wunder> it works when I have access to the admin area on other instances. Just not from cli

[01:22:52] <TML> impliednude: I understand. Just trying to make sure you're not being sold a bill-of-goods
[01:22:58] <__adrian> which means, i don't follow the problem. if you _have_ ES, why do you need to make magento install without ES?
[01:23:33] <TML> I can't assist on the magento side, I wasn't even aware it required ES
[01:23:35] <impliednude> __adrian> it doesn't work when installing a fresh instance of magento2.4.x

[01:23:55] <__adrian> do you know what "deosn't work" means?
[01:24:01] <TML> paule32: can you try rephrasing the question, maybe?
[01:24:23] <impliednude> now that installing an instance with a remote ES cluster, magento 2.4.x. refuses to install and blames the ES

[01:25:03] <impliednude> but if I side load an existing m2 instance I can setup in the backend with our cluster just fine
[01:25:29] <impliednude> using ./magento install from cli and the right information doesn't work.
[01:26:18] <TML> impliednude: The question was, what does "doesn't work" actually look like in this case? Is there a particular message being printed?
[01:26:27] <da_wunder> I'm still quite sure that this is the issue - 23:44 < da_wunder> most likely just wrong credentials or you cannot access that from magento server
[01:26:39] <impliednude> it literally says Could not validate a connection to Elasticsearch. Unknown error from Elasticsearch null
[01:27:37] <impliednude> but if I use the cred's with an existing magento db and change it to the right values in the admin config area via http. it works
[01:27:38] <da_wunder> read my message once again
[01:27:51] <da_wunder> confirm that you can access that ES instance from your server
[01:28:05] <impliednude> da_wunder> I can. but magento can't from cli
[01:28:22] <judah> Perhaps different env on cli vs web?
[01:28:44] <da_wunder> so you can access it from CLI but magento cannot? are you sure that magento is really using CLI?
[01:28:44] <impliednude> perhaps different code they use
[01:28:52] <impliednude> da_wunder> yes.
[01:29:04] <judah> Have not been keeping up, but Magento is super picky about what ES versions it will connect to. Sometimes it will work, sometimes it will silently fail
[01:29:15] <TML> impliednude: https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/318831/magento-2-4-0-getting-error-could-not-validate-a-connection-to-elasticsearch seems to suggest you can do a "module:disable {Magento_ElasticsearchCatalogPermissions,Magento_Elasticsearch,Magento_InventoryElasticsearch,Magento_Elasticsearch6,Magento_Elasticsearch7}" to get past this
[01:29:35] <impliednude> TML> which no longer works. -sighs-
[01:29:51] <TML> *shrug* Start editing code?
[01:29:53] <impliednude> TML> you have to have installed the m2 instance to do that. using module_disable says sorry

[01:30:11] <impliednude> TML> I just hoped I didn't have to
[01:30:22] <TML> I couldn't tell you - never used Magento
[01:30:35] <TML> I'm just a "bigger hammer" kind of guy
[01:31:27] <impliednude> TML> the problem with magento2 is that in order to run ./magento module:disable you have to have installed the system. so if I do ./magento install. it has not created the files or the db stuff at all
[01:32:10] <impliednude> TML> yeah, I get ya. I think I will clone, change path's as needed within .sql file. then load it into the system, then change the ES so it works correctly.
[01:32:42] <impliednude> I just hate big hammer's
[01:34:31] <judah> Magento is not exactly great to work with either. The entire stack is designed as a technical proof of concept where convoluted code is celebrated, documentation is frowned upon, and exceptions are silenced. The more I use it the stronger I recommend against using it.

[09:09:27] <tirnanog> using an RFC 822 conforming parser that can do exactly that seems sensible enough. the real issue is the unstructured and irregular nature of whois data.

[09:11:39] <Hash> Here's the bit of code
[09:11:50] <Hash> Here's a list of ips that hammered my server with targeteed junk last night
[09:12:12] <Hash> I am trying to find a good way to grab abuse emails for those ips and send one email to them all with the data.
[09:12:18] <Hash> logs etc.
[09:12:40] <Hash> It stops after 62. in the array as per the log file generated
[09:12:43] <tirnanog> I understand. but just as a random example, whois 8.8.8.8 would not match your 'Abuse contact for' constraint. anyway, the parser you mentioned can extract email addresses fine.
[09:13:07] <Hash> if it doesn't math a grep, it should just get nothing.
[09:13:18] <Hash> if you search somethign and grep fo rwhat doesn't exist, you get nothing.
[09:14:33] <tirnanog> yes, obviously. all I'm saying is that whois data is not presented in a uniform manner. there are plenty of ways to list abuse contacts that would be missed by filtering out lines that don't match the pattern you're using there. if you accept that, fine.
[09:14:52] <Hash> I see.

[09:15:19] <Hash> Let's see if I get 1023 lines of abuse emails in my log

[09:18:53] <tirnanog> I think you should at least check the exit status of whois so that you can keep track of errors. it's being lost by your current code. or maybe find a first-class library for issuing whois queries for php.
[09:19:00] <Hash> Oh
[09:19:10] <Hash> how would I do that?
[09:20:18] <tirnanog> I'm not even sure you can get the exit status with shell_exec. what version of php is this?
[09:20:40] <Hash> which ever you want me to have
[09:20:43] <Hash> I don't mind.
[09:20:55] <Hash> PHP 8.0.14 (cli) (built: Dec 20 2021 21:22:57) ( NTS )
[09:22:08] <Hash> best is to get the entire whois db from somewhere
[09:22:11] <Hash> for local use.
[09:24:13] <tirnanog> if you cut out grep and execute only whois, you can get its exit status. look at exec() - where the exit status is $result_code in the synopsis - or even proc_open(). you'd have to filter - or iterate over - the lines in php rather than use grep then, but that's not much of a problem.
[09:24:31] <tirnanog> if the status isn't 0, somethign went wrong.
[09:24:43] <tirnanog> and that would be a good reason to back off.

[09:28:07] <Hash> usually they have the word 'abuse' in the email.
[09:28:59] <tirnanog> you can't get the exit status with shell_exec(). it's completely discarded. but, also, if you use a shell pipeline, and even if you're using a php function that _can_ return the exit status value - such as exec() - you're only getting the exit status value of the last command in the pipeline. that's no good because whois is the first command in your pipeline.
[09:29:56] <tirnanog> that's why I suggest to execute only whois and check the result_code to see if it failed.
[09:30:11] <tirnanog> if it didn't, iterate over the array containing the lines from stdout and do your matching there.

[09:36:22] <Hash> Oh
[09:36:24] <Hash> ok
[09:36:32] <tirnanog> and then, getting rid of the pipeline addresses the issue of getting the exit status value of whois itself.
[09:36:53] <TML> i.e., in some cases you'll find an OrgAbuseRef or abuse-c field, and you'll want to grab those even if they aren't "abuse@"
[09:37:04] <Hash> ok

[09:37:40] <tirnanog> some shells can work around it but, as far as shelling out from php is concerned, you have to assume it's just plain posix sh.

[09:50:17] <TML> > Registered users can also use our Abuse Reporting API or Fail2Ban Integration to automatically submit abuse reports to our database.
[09:51:43] <TML> honestly, your best solution is to just block that IP and move on

[13:33:24] <TML> I don't understand your question there - but here's an example for you of how to do bound parameters: https://replit.com/@tml/TurboFewEngine#main.php
[13:34:23] <TML> you really need to get away from string interpolation, especially where you have user-supplied values coming into your database
[13:35:09] <TML> php-bot: tell sambauer74 about why pdo
[13:35:35] <TML> hmm - does that not work anymore?
[13:35:38] <TML> !+why pdo
[13:35:38] <php-bot> For the most part, what PDO does is give you access to parameterized queries, which are fundamentally different than escaping. In parameterized queries, "data" (such as your variables) and "code" (the SQL) are sent along different paths, so that there's no *possible* way for "data" to leak over into the space of "code", which is fundamentally what is happening when you have SQL injection.
[13:35:45] <TML> good enough, I suppose
[13:44:30] <sambauer74> okay, thank you
[13:44:42] <sambauer74> in this code ($_POST['product-expired'] ?? "")  what is ?? "" doing?

[14:36:08] <Naktibalda> NakedKing: you need lock field in database
[14:37:09] <AllenJB> PHP has no idea if a page is being viewed or when it stops being viewed on a browser. You could set a record with a timestamp when a user clicks into the edit page, then clear the timestamp if they save or cancel. But this wouldn't account for users clicking other links on the page or closing the browser.
[14:37:32] <AllenJB> You can then say if another user started editing the page less than x minutes ago, display a warning
[14:37:45] <Naktibalda> timestamp and username or id of the user who is editing.
[14:38:09] <AllenJB> (which of course doesn't account for a user having a page open to edit for more than that amount of time)
[14:38:11] <Naktibalda> you can leave that on page close event in javascript to unlock the page

[14:38:56] <AllenJB> You could enhance this with a periodic AJAX call that fires, for example, every 1 minute while a user has the page open to edit.
[14:38:57] <Naktibalda> yeah, so the lock should timeout in predefined period of time. If editor is openned it could use ajax requests to refresh lock

[20:58:01] <TML> I'm honestly shocked hashphp is still up
[20:59:02] <TML> if someone wants to take over long-term hosting of hashphp.org, LMK - the current hosting is with caffinated's old employer, they're doing it as a memorial to him, which could dry up at any time and without notice
[20:59:48] <__adrian> i'll talk to my employer
[21:00:24] <__adrian> do we have the source?
[21:00:55] <judah> Im happy to host it, if we are letting any random on the internet volunteer
[21:01:17] <TML> I can probably get it, but if I need to do that, I can certainly host it myself. The question was more like "who wants to take a stab at building something with it"

[21:05:56] <__adrian> i don't know what that would look like
[21:06:03] <__adrian> but sounds interesting
[21:06:31] <__adrian> phpsadness is out of date, and i always thought it was more informative/funny than sad.
[21:07:36] <__adrian> first thought to my mind was a snippet blog
[21:08:02] <__adrian> and a starter tutorial, of course. so we can stop saying "learn the basics."  how?  "i don't know"

[23:09:31] <shinbet> hello, I've started some 480 hour php studies and I'm hoping for some IDE recomendation, we got php storm license but I refuse to use it, and I currently used KATE which is cool and now I'm installing Atom to try, I suspect people here might know a thing or two about floss IDEs for php

[23:16:01] <judah> shinbet, use phpstorm. Its popular for a reason
[23:16:22] <judah> If you dont want that recommendation, then use whatever you like because at the end of the day its up to you
[23:17:15] <judah> If it makes you feel any better, JetBrains has been a great supporter of the PHP ecosystem for quite a while. It might be closed source, but the company has a good reputation
[23:17:50] <AllenJB> You could look at VSCode which I believe is open source and people have had some success configuring for PHP. But I would personally recommend PHPStorm - it's the best in class and nothing else I've tried is as good.

[23:20:59] <AllenJB> Indeed JetBrains are good to the PHP community. They're part of the new PHP Foundation being set up to help fund core development. And they've employed PHP core developers to work on PHP core.
[23:27:17] <shinbet> ok, I understand. I just avoid things that gives you free trial for 6 months and then you just have to pay for habit. I mean in highschool we used CodeBlocks IDE for writing C++, and theres no autocompletion or similar fancy features except that it was more comfortable to compile and debug. Like they got me used to SolidWorks for CAD and that has astronomical price for a little individual like me. However I now tried this Atom editor and it
[23:27:17] <shinbet> has that fanciness of suggesting things in more fluid manner than Kate does as you type. Thing is that I doubt that I'll ever be a full time PHP programmer, I'mean I'm gonna need it and after 8hours of lectures PHP was proven tome as an awesome scripting language

[23:30:54] <shinbet> also as little basics of php as I got in those 8 hours filled some of my skill gaps already, now I have a nicer idea of webscrapping, lots of potential for writing useful bots and theres even plenty of telegram bot APIs in php

[23:32:49] <Albright> Use Nova if you're on a Mac. Not free but well worth the cost.
[23:33:13] <Nekomander> PHPStorm is the be-all-end-all for working with PHP.
[23:33:24] <Albright> I wouldn't use an Electron-based editor (Atom or VSCode) if my life depended on it.
[23:33:50] <Nekomander> If you're cheap, use their EAP (Early Access Program) version of PHPStorm which you do not have to pay to use.
[23:34:06] <Albright> The Java-based ones (including PHPStorm) are only marginally better. But this is my unpopular opinion.
[23:35:00] <Nekomander> As with using any bleeding edge next/beta version of software, don't expect perfection (In my experience, has been great)
[23:36:42] <Nekomander> When I'm not using that, I'm on gEdit for Linux. Sometimes, Komodo Edit, all of which are free. Komodo IDE became free, so you can use that too.
[23:41:50] <Nekomander> I've had great experience with Electron-based software, from Typora to Obsidian. I'm not going to pretend that every Electron based app is great, but the ones I use are good. :) - As far as memory consumption and etc goes, I have no idea. I just use em, and it's very responsive.
[23:43:42] <shinbet> Nekomander, so have you tried Atom ?
[23:46:24] <judah> Atom will get the job done, but its apples to pears in comparison. Its a good editor, but its not an IDE
[23:46:44] <Albright> Ah, we're splitting that hair, are we?
[23:47:30] <Albright> I don't mind pure editors. IDEs often try to do too much and end up doing stuff I don't need it to do.
[23:48:22] <Nekomander> shinbet, I haven't.
[23:48:40] <Albright> Nova's precursor Coda had a built-in MySQL client I never used because I just use Sequel Pro, an built-in terminal I never used because I just use Terminal, a built-in documentation viewer I never used because I just used Dash or a web browser…
[23:49:57] <shinbet> Albright, dash is it that version of shell or something else ?
[23:50:08] <Albright> So I personally am fine with using a competent editor over a full IDE, but that's my opinion.
[23:50:30] <anyone> {shell + editor + compiler} is an IDE too, ya know
[23:50:32] <Albright> shinbet: Not sure I understand your question, but the Dash I'm referring to is a documentation searching app.
[23:50:43] <Albright> https://kapeli.com/dash
[23:50:59] <shinbet> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dash
[23:51:03] <shinbet> Dash (Debian Almquist shell)
[23:51:07] <shinbet> I thought this dash
[23:51:34] <Albright> Ah, no.
[23:51:42] <da_wunder> I would just use jetbrains IDE's
[23:52:49] <shinbet> well I'm familiar with shell very much and have already some sysadmin skills so I'm not worried about manually dealing with sql or launching scripts from terminal, and your opinion seems to prove my doubts about needlessly getting addicted to some IDEs
[23:54:15] <Albright> Well… use the tools that work best for you. I just disagree with the "correct" answers of heavy Java IDEs and crappy slow Electron editors personally and want people to know there's alternatives.
[23:54:18] <wutzelputz> Some 50c from me, a php dev for salary since about 12 years: every buck I spent on phpstorm was repaid at least 100x in both productivity and peace of mind.
[23:55:05] <da_wunder> personally used jetbrains products since 2011, and going back - also sometimes I use eg. vscode or old-good ultraedit for specified tasks - but like 98% just those jetbrains products for coding
[23:55:56] <da_wunder> and I can confirm what wutzelputz said
[23:56:44] <Albright> And I feel the same way about the license fees I've paid for Nova/Coda, Dash, etc. Again, just my opinion. :P
[23:57:12] <anyone> There is this "uncanny" valley of latency where latency exists and does practically affect people without them noticing it to be there. For example, a 25ms roundtrip to an ssh-ed host.
[23:57:17] <da_wunder> yeah, everyone has own opinion of tools what they want to use and it's ok
[23:57:39] <da_wunder> although you could just use EAP versions of jetbrains product for free
[23:57:46] <anyone> and beefy terminal emulators and IDEs also have the same latency fallacies - https://lwn.net/Articles/751763/
[23:59:33] <shinbet> Albright, yeah I wrote 2 variants of webscrapping bot, used what I knew from shell scripting and basic php of what I've learned from 8 hours of study, lecturer recommended everyone to learn shell. I think I'll avoid IDEs for couple of months and if it will make me lag behind majority of students because they use php storm them maybe I'll consider it :D
