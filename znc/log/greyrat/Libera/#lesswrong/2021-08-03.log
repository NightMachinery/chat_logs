[01:07:29] <Robomot> Racial bias in AI - is it a big deal? (Racial bias in AI - is it a big deal?)
[01:07:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Essentially a medical algorithm is able to identify self-reported race with +90% accuracy from features in scans that humans can't even detect. The AI appears to be able to get good accuracy from x-rays that humans can't even identify as being x-rays to begin with."
[01:07:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This difficulty in isolating the features associated with racial identity is really important, because one suggestion people tend to have when they get shown evidence of racial bias is that we should make the algorithms ‚Äúcolorblind‚Äù ‚Äì to remove the features that encode the protected attribute and thereby make it so the AI cannot ‚Äúsee‚Äù race but should still perform well on the clinical tasks we care about.
[01:07:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here, it seems like there is no easy way to remove racial information from images. It is everywhere and it is in everything."
[01:08:13] <ggreer> it's almost as if... nevermind

[01:09:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://lukeoakdenrayner.wordpress.com/2021/08/02/ai-has-the-worst-superpower-medical-racism/ from one of the authors of the paper

[01:10:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The paper is extensive, with dozens of experiments replicated at multiple sites around the world. It comes with a complete code repository so anyone can reproduce any part of it (although a minority of the datasets are not publicly available, and a few more require an approval process). It even comes with the public release of new racial identity labels for several public datasets, which were obtained with the collaboration
[01:10:29] <Obormot\Arcturus>  of the dataset developers." ... ok, props to them for this
[01:10:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> "One thing we noticed when we were working on this research was that there was a clear divide in our team. The more clinical and safety/bias related researchers were shocked, confused, and frankly horrified by the results we were getting. Some of the computer scientists and the more junior researchers on the other hand were surprised by our reaction. They didn‚Äôt really understand why we were concerned." ... rofl
[01:12:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> What amazes me, personally, is that there's a single word in this that makes a total mockery of all of this hand-wringing

[01:13:14] <RiversHaveWings> ?
[01:13:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do you in all seriousness pearl-clutch about an AI "seeing race" or w/e if the racial category assignments you're matching are "self-reported" in the first place?
[01:13:40] <RiversHaveWings> They are probably just highly correlated with whatever the AI is detecting?

[01:16:39] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: almost like everything is correlated, eh?
[01:16:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I‚Äôm going to try to lay out, as clearly as possible, that this AI behaviour is both surprising, and a very bad thing if we care about patient safety, equity, and generalisability.
[01:16:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> The argument will have the following parts:
[01:16:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... 3. Humans cannot identify the racial identity of a patient from medical images. In medical imaging we don‚Äôt routinely have access to racial identity information, so human oversight of this problem is extremely limited at the clinical level." ... ahahaha

[01:17:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Unlike smart AIs, we dumb humans can't tell what race anyone is, so we can't manually make the AI ignore relevant data" amazing
[01:18:01] <RiversHaveWings> Also the features aren't racial identity, they're just something really correlated with it.
[01:18:06] <saturn2> the worry is that the AI will spontaneously become white supremacist because it can detect race?
[01:18:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> RiversHaveWings: Someone needs to link him the Sequence post about "by definition", lol
[01:18:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "4. The features the AI makes use of appear to occur across the entire image spectrum and are not regionally localised, which will severely limit our ability to stop AI systems from doing this." looool
[01:19:10] <ggreer> the worry is... unclear. every possible thing can be used as evidence of racism. too many clinical trials with predominantly white men? racism because the data might not apply equally to other races. too many clinical trials with predominantly black men? racist medical experimentation!
[01:19:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yeah basically? Let me quote steps 1 and 2 I guess:
[01:19:14] <RiversHaveWings> Like what is the alternative here? They investigate what these newly discovered features actually *are* and... get pilloried for being racist?
[01:19:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "1. Medical practice is biased in favour of the privileged classes in any society, and worldwide towards a specific type of white men.
[01:19:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. AI can trivially learn to recognise features in medical imaging studies that are strongly correlated with racial identity. This provides a powerful and direct mechanism for models to incorporate the biases in medical practice into their decisions."
[01:20:25] <saturn2> my god, it's bias all the way down
[01:20:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man there's so much to quote here

[03:43:30] <PlanckWalk> There are some people who want that.
[03:43:47] <PlanckWalk> I wouldn't say "full of" though
[03:44:23] <quanticle> Not just Australia: https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/07/10/some-britons-crave-permanent-pandemic-lockdown

[03:45:07] <quanticle> "Even more strikingly, a sizeable minority would like personal freedoms to be restricted permanently. A quarter say nightclubs and casinos should never reopen; almost two in ten would support an indefinite ban on leaving home after 10pm 'without good reason'."
[03:45:30] <Betawolf> there was a post about that poll where they ran the same thing but rephrased the question and it dropped massively
[03:45:51] <Betawolf> still pretty weird, but question framing might be a thing for that percentage figure
[03:46:10] <ggreer> if you tried this in the US, you'd get chaos. people would riot
[03:46:33] <PlanckWalk> Note: the Army personnel in that effort are unarmed, while the police are armed.
[03:46:57] <Betawolf> so the police can just- wait no.
[03:46:58] <ggreer> how many people have been fined or arrested in the US for not wearing masks, not staying at home, etc? I'm pretty sure it's close to zero

A clever game outlined below illustrates the basic idea. Players 1,2 and 3 are asked to make (simultaneous) choices to earn prizes (money for the adults and older kids, points for toys for the younger kids). [‚Ä¶])
[03:56:19] <gwern> quanticle: yeah, it's pretty interesting. you don't usually get such a clearcut piagetian example of the limitations of many adult humans' ability to think
[03:57:04] <gwern> it's a very sharp algorithmic limitation: they just can't do the recursion. it's not like vocab where it's like a few thousand words vs a few thousand words, big diff
[03:57:35] <ggreer> a lot of people can't do hypotheticals
[03:57:46] <gwern> right, and this is a nice clear example of that
[03:57:47] <quanticle> But I'm sure that with the right training we'll turn them all into web developers, amirite
[03:58:18] <gwern> it's framed as a game, is perfectly straightforward, incentivized, no weird mechanics, no "well maaaaybe luria's peasants are lying because they're afraid of the big bad government" excuses
[03:58:22] <gwern> yet, they can't do it
[03:59:17] <gwern> because of GPT-3 and stacked sigmoids, I've been increasingly thinking that this sort of learning curve / plateau / breakthrough on algorithmic abilities may be a big part of the overall picture of 'what is intelligence and how do we brain'

[04:11:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh, someone explain the rules of this game to me
[04:11:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Player 3 is simply asked to match a shape."
[04:11:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Match what shape? With what?
[04:11:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> This diagram explains nothing
[04:12:06] <Betawolf> square blue a matches to square red c because square
[04:12:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh the diagram is backwards
[04:12:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> For some reason
[04:12:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow that's odd
[04:12:58] <Betawolf> yeah that image is a bit weird.
[04:13:01] <gwern> yeah, it flows right to left
[04:13:09] <gwern> I had to think about it too
[04:13:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> So P3 picks C, P2 picks B, P1 picks B

[04:14:42] <quanticle> Yep
[04:14:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok
[04:15:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> "children interested in STEM fields perform better (n.b. this implies that contrary to some opinions the STEM set are _better_ at social interaction)" ... why does it imply that
[04:15:36] <quanticle> Because it implies that you're better at judging what other people are going to do or something
[04:15:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> It does not
[04:15:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dunno why anyone would conclude that from this
[04:15:58] <Betawolf> they're leaping from 'better at handling abstractions we say are about people' to 'better at modelling and empathising with people'
[04:16:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Quite
[04:16:07] <quanticle> ^
[04:16:39] <quanticle> Or rather, I think Alex Tabbarok is doing that
[04:16:53] <Betawolf> the actual answer is STEM nerds can solve all three elements of this simple puzzle because they ignore the 'what does a person think' the question purports to embed
[04:16:54] <quanticle> I don't think that's from the actual paper
[04:19:01] <quanticle> Here's the actual paper, by the way: http://isabellebrocas.org/Research/levelkids.pdf
[04:19:02] <Robomot> PDF (42 pages; 1.9 MB) - Steps of reasoning in children and adolescents ‚Ä¶
[04:19:10] <Betawolf> cheers.
[04:20:04] <PlanckWalk> To the extent that it was really about people, player 1 would be assessing whether player 2 can judge what player 3 is going to do, and play based on that.
[04:20:29] <quanticle> Not on Sci-Hub surprisingly enough, even though it's from last year.
[04:20:35] <PlanckWalk> Not what player 2 woudl play if they were perfect.
[04:21:01] <Betawolf> but you don't actually know anything about any of these people so you just pretend humans are going to get the correct answer and remove them from the question
[04:21:11] <PlanckWalk> Yes, in practice
[04:21:34] <PlanckWalk> Ah great, the paper itself
[04:22:11] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, looks like they probably did know the other players
[04:22:25] <PlanckWalk> They're all recruited from the same school.
[04:23:54] <PlanckWalk> But yes, in practice I expect all players that were capable at all didn't consider anything more than just a simple model for the other players
[04:25:10] <quanticle> Yeah, I don't think anyone went to the level of, "Well, I know Joe is P2, and Joe is an idiot, so I'm going to guess randomly because I know Joe is going to guess randomly"
[04:25:43] <filipepe> gwern: do you think psychotherapy works?
[04:26:17] <PlanckWalk> Maybe modelling would work better in repeated games with the same players, if you were player 2
[04:26:38] <quanticle> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict#History
[04:26:39] <PlanckWalk> E.g. you might notice that player 3 is an idiot and consistently matches colour instead of shape.
[04:26:39] <Robomot> Dodo bird verdict - Wikipedia [History] (The Dodo bird verdict (or Dodo bird conjecture) is a controversial topic in psychotherapy,[1] referring to the claim that all empirically validated psychotherapies, regardless of their specific components, produce equivalent outcomes. It is named after the Dodo character in Alice in Wonderland. ‚Ä¶)
[04:26:43] <gwern> filipepe: most psychotherapies work, for certain degrees of 'work', and they're all the same, unfortunately: the dodo bird verdict. what makes CBT remarkable is that it seems to work a bit better regardless of the therapist
[04:27:10] <gwern> quanticle: no, it's from this year
[04:27:26] <Betawolf> looking at it, they were in repeated games, so you could learn that a player is an idiot
[04:27:35] <gwern> you're just looking at a 2019 or 2020 working paper (I checked in GS, just haven't gotten around to jailbreaking the 2021 published version)
[04:27:39] <quanticle> Oh. Was it published this year? The date on the paper says November 2020
[04:27:46] <quanticle> Ah, okay
[04:27:47] <PlanckWalk> Ohh, this could change things.  They were previously asked to play a "lying game".
[04:28:21] <quanticle> Are there likely to be big differences between the working paper and the final publication?
[04:30:08] <PlanckWalk> Ah okay.  "anonymous partners drawn randomly after each trial"
[04:30:30] <PlanckWalk> So there's no real possibility of assessing the other players except as a mass.

[04:30:51] <PlanckWalk> Also no feedback after each trial.
[04:30:53] <gwern> quanticle: the graphs/tables are usually a lot nicer and in position. the working paper tends to include the kitchen sink. if you're looking to take down a paper, you'll want to compare the working paper and published version carefully to see what they changed, because it'll typically be to make it look better
[04:31:11] <Betawolf> ah, missed that
[04:31:35] <gwern> particularly in economics, sometimes the interpretation or numbers may change a *lot* as someone points out major issues while they spend years shopping around the working paper
[04:32:00] <quanticle> I think the biggest result is, "the vast majority of participants either play always at equilibrium or they play at equilibrium only when they have a dominant strategy. There are a few random players, and virtually no one exhibits an 'intermediate' level of reasoning (i.e. plays at equilibrium when it requires two steps of reasoning, but not when it requires three steps)." Like gwern said,
[04:32:02] <quanticle> either you get it or you don't.
[04:32:22] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that part is definitely important
[04:34:30] <gwern> yeah, it's an interesting sharp distinction. you would normally epxect something like, I dunno, 50% of players getting all 3, 25% getting 2, and the dumbest 25% getting level 1. not a sharp separation between 3 and 1
[04:34:58] <gwern> if you were to test reading literacy or reading comprehension of a table, or a driver's license, or something, you would get a smooth spectrum
[04:35:31] <gwern> here, it's just binary. you either get or don't get recursion. like piagetian levels: you either get conservation of volume, or you don't
[04:35:48] <quanticle> "Finally, differences across schools and across tracks within schools are also associated with differences in sophistication. In particular, we find that students enrolled in different programs or in different GPA-based tracks within programs exhibit different levels of sophistication."
[04:35:50] <quanticle> I'll take, "How do you say 'IQ' without saying 'IQ' for 800, Trebeck"
[04:36:04] <PlanckWalk> Haha
[04:37:14] <filipepe> ah, Metacognitive therapy
[04:37:58] <gwern> quanticle: I would be shocked if it wasn't... raven matrix tests are like that too, incidentally, you either solve a problem or don't, there's typically not much additional thinking does to help you
[04:38:03] <quanticle> "Working with a population of children and adolescents presents important methodological challenges."

[04:38:29] <adiabatic> kids are less than ideal organisms for study
[04:38:36] <adiabatic> they're not, like, planaria
[04:40:00] <gwern> not as bad as cats, though
[04:40:31] <quanticle> PlanckWalk: Okay, I finally got around to reading the experiment design, and yeah, does the fact that this experiment took place after two trials of a lying game bias things?
[04:41:09] <quanticle> gwern: Speaking of which, I got a Slack message from my co-worker around noon today: "Sorry I can't review your PR. I'm in the urgent care clinic"
[04:41:16] <quanticle> me: "Oh no, are you okay"
[04:41:33] <quanticle> him: "Nothing life threatening; my cute but idiotic cat bit me and I need antibiotics"
[04:41:58] <gwern> :( it's funny when you're young and healthy, but when you're old and/or senile, not so funny
[04:42:10] <adiabatic> does he know cats are made of meat and does he eat meat and does his cat know that he knows that it's made of meat
[04:42:27] <gwern> adiabatic: the cat definitely knows *he* is made of meat
[04:42:33] <adiabatic> yes
[04:42:33] <quanticle> adiabatic: Look, just because it's made of meat doesn't mean you can eat it
[04:42:46] <quanticle> I mean, cows are made of meat and I don't eat those either
[04:42:51] <PlanckWalk> I don't think the previous lying game would affect the main result of the sharp cutoff.
[04:43:09] <adiabatic> quanticle: I just want everyone to know what's on the table, that's all
[04:43:28] <quanticle> Not cat meat, that's for sure
[04:43:34] <quanticle> Well
[04:43:36] <quanticle> Maybe your table
[04:43:38] <quanticle> Not mine though
[04:43:50] <adiabatic> I wouldn't want to prep the cat myself; the meat/bone ratio is gonna be on the low side
[04:44:03] <adiabatic> but then again I wouldn't want to have to bother to pluck a chicken
[04:45:51] <quanticle> I've scaled a fish and that was quite enough for me thank you very much
[04:46:43] <quanticle> This was when I was in the Boy Scouts. We were all very proud of our fishing and filleting skills. Then my mom visited. "You're wasting like *half* the fish"
[04:46:56] <quanticle> "No don't throw away the head, the head's the best part!"
[04:48:00] <quanticle> *under her breath* "Americans, I swear to god"
[04:49:26] <gwern> (which one)
[04:50:02] <quanticle> Which... one? There's only one Boy Scouts?
[04:50:19] <gwern> which god would be concerned with the waste of perfectly good heads?
[04:50:30] <quanticle> Oh, Lakshmi probably
[04:50:39] <gwern> (and actually I expect in a few years there may well be more than one boy scouts, trademark/naming issues aside)
[04:50:57] <quanticle> She's the goddess of prosperity and I was told as a child that if I threw food away, Lakshmi would not visit our house any more
[04:51:24] <gwern> 'wealth, fortune, power, health, love, beauty, joy and prosperity' hm, I'd expect a food-specific god(dess) but I suppose under 'waste not want not' lakshmi makes as much sense
[04:53:07] <Betawolf> We just weren't allowed to leave the table until we'd eaten the food. Divine authority is not necessary.
[04:53:27] <quanticle> Now that I think about it, there aren't that many food specific gods or goddesses in Hinduism
[04:53:35] <quanticle> I can't think of anything analogous to e.g. Bacchus
[04:53:41] <gwern> really? but what about cows and dairy?

[05:22:35] <quanticle> the time. It's not ugly, per se, but the game's action pauses often enough for cameras to linger on the blurry stuff and make players wonder what the heck Nintendo's 'HD' team was thinking."

[09:38:32] <rmmh> first contact books so often succeed or fail based on their gimmick and their deus ex machina, don't they
[09:38:51] <rmmh> but you have to understand that I normally consume a literary diet of 95% refuse, so this is a marked step up
[09:39:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh
[09:39:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> This short story collection I am reading is ... mostly kinda mediocre (all the "women's fantasy" stuff is amusing at best) but then there's some gems
[09:39:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's one by Neil Gaiman and it's excellent
[09:40:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And also almost indescribably British)
[09:40:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I could *hear* the characters' accents as I read it)
[09:40:30] <rmmh> there's some writing that you can kind of appreciate in the abstract, but definitely feel like you're not the target audience

[09:45:25] <Obormot\Gaia> And I'm like "sorry, who???"

[09:48:21] <Obormot\Gaia> "Snodgrass helped recover a version of the award-winning Star Trek: The Next Generation episode The Measure of a Man by saving an old VHS cassette.[5] This allowed a new version to be re-constructed from existing film shots, and an extended cut with 13 minutes of additional footage was released in HD in 2012.[5]" ... wow what a hero
[09:48:42] <rmmh> ...they *lost* an episode??

[09:49:16] <Obormot\Gaia> That is some sf street cred

[10:31:05] <PlanckWalk> Carpet in a kitchen isn't very good either though.  Splashes of various liquids and food spills are pretty common too.

[12:05:16] <adiabatic> that does seem kind of weird
[12:05:25] <rmmh> the german constitution is like 300 pages
[12:05:30] <rmmh> I'm sure it has weirder clauses
[12:05:54] <kuudes> my point is that it is in the header, sort of

[12:06:05] <kuudes> executive summary

[12:06:11] <kuudes> abstract
[12:06:11] <kuudes> etc
[12:06:13] <quanticle> I mean, the Constitution also mandates that Congress establish patents 
[12:06:26] <rmmh> To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;
[12:06:31] <rmmh> is this why defense bills happen so often
[12:06:35] <kuudes> quanticle, with what word?
[12:06:39] <saturn2> the amendments don't have any more or less legal force than the rest
[12:06:49] <kuudes> saturn2, sure
[12:06:55] <kuudes> and the point is not that
[12:07:15] <kuudes> it is imo just similar to competition law being in the beginning of treaty of european union
[12:07:45] <rmmh> do other constitutions have the same default-deny structure as the US?

[12:09:18] <feep[work]> rmmh: the german constitution certainly *had* weird clauses when it was made :D
[12:09:19] <quanticle> Yeah, well, nobody cares about the bankruptcy thing either, which is why I'm surprised that kuudes chose that
[12:09:25] <kuudes> quanticle, that is still more abstract
[12:09:36] <kuudes> it is not about patents, but is also about copyrights etc

[12:14:13] <quanticle> I think Montana can still do it on state highways, but not the Interstate
[12:16:35] <quanticle> Okay, I looked into it just now. Montana doesn't have "reasonable and prudent" on its state highways either. That was the result of a *state* Supreme Court ruling that said that the "reasonable and prudent" limit gave too much discretion to the state, making it unconstitutionally vague.
[12:16:39] <PapuaHardyNet> the german constitution is on github?
[12:16:52] <saturn2> eroded seems like the wrong word, these changes were made very suddenly
[12:17:49] <rmmh> Montana meets the letter of the law by fining violators $5 for ‚Äúan unnecessary waste of a natural resource.‚Äù But, in spirit, Montana is telling the feds to shove it.
[12:18:59] <quanticle> Yeah, Montana was where I found out that a Honda Odyssey is *remarkably stable* at 100mph

[12:20:06] <nshepperd2> they tried to make USA an American Union, but it wanted to be a country instead
[12:20:58] <rmmh> was robert e lee the first union buster?
[12:20:59] <quanticle> Well, if you're referring to the Articles of Confederation, then yes. But the Constitution was an explicitly federal system from the get-go
[12:22:10] <quanticle> And funnily enough, it was a series of debt and currency crises that caused the change

[12:24:08] <feep[work]> the question isn't flexible day or week
[12:24:08] <quanticle> Oh, you don't care about times, just dates?
[12:24:14] <feep[work]> the question is, can a holiday be on no time at all.
[12:24:48] <feep[work]> not even dates, just is "not any particular time at all" a valid state for a holiday object
[12:24:50] <quanticle> Well... not official holidays, but many companies in the US offer their workers one or two days of "floating holiday" that they can can take whenever.
[12:24:54] <quanticle> Does that count?
[12:25:05] <feep[work]> okay, yes if I was modelling holidays in general
[12:25:09] <feep[work]> probably not in this case :p

[12:26:14] <quanticle> Probably sound
[12:27:45] <kuudes> feep[work], what about those "ascension of emperor"?

[12:28:44] <nshepperd2> surely that's the future's problem
[12:28:49] <feep[work]> it is.
[12:30:57] <kuudes> what about those new russian "nonworking days"
[12:31:17] <kuudes> which are with aim of stay-at-home but people used them for visit-the-elderly
[12:31:38] <kuudes> which were things that putin or mayor or someone declared *now*
[12:32:09] <kuudes> ...what is your definition of holiday?
[12:32:10] <saturn2> a holiday without a day would be a holi
[12:32:34] <saturn2> so you should make a holi class and a holiday class that inherits from it
[12:32:44] <kuudes> birth of universe?
[12:34:09] <nshepperd2> surely all days are equally holy
[12:34:22] <feep[work]> first among holies

[13:27:01] <gry> I don't have a reliable source that would fill the blanks in "people often have ___ months active antibodies after being sick with covid, and ____ months active antibodies after being fully vaccinated with ____"
[13:27:03] <saturn2> (not me)
[13:27:05] <gry> that's what I mean
[13:27:26] <gry> in Australia the official leaflet for the vaccine says that they don't know how long lasting it is - and that's official
[13:27:55] <kuudes> saturn2, yes. but we have more legible state so it is harder
[13:28:07] <nshepperd2> i wouldn't feel bad about getting a third dose via the 'show up at the clinic when they're about to close' route
[13:28:37] <kuudes> over here we have electronic patient records nationwide
[13:28:41] <nshepperd2> if they were going to throw it out anyway...
[13:28:47] <kuudes> but I suppose I could threaten them with violence
[13:29:23] <kuudes> or well, I guess I could try to plea to some doctor that I will otherwise die or something
[13:29:45] <saturn2> if you show up without any ID will they turn you away?
[13:30:11] <kuudes> likely yes, unless I can plausibly present to be an asylum seeker or something
[13:30:13] <saturn2> or do they have retinal scanners or something
[13:30:23] <nshepperd2> unless your healthcare workers are all faceless automatons, i imagine you could find one willing to bend the rules and not record it if the vaccine would otherwise be thrown out
[13:30:41] <kuudes> yeah, could be
[13:30:58] <kuudes> but ok. so getting an antibody test could be useful
[13:31:21] <kuudes> now afk
[13:32:10] <kuudes> feel free to write info to my backlog. I will read it and appreciate it
[13:33:03] <saturn2> there's a bunch of discussion here https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/fBGzge5i4hfbaQZWy/usd1000-bounty-how-effective-are-marginal-vaccine-doses
[13:33:05] <Robomot> ($1000 bounty) How effective are marginal vaccine doses against the covid delta variant?  - LessWrong 2.0 viewer (Since I got vaccinated I‚Äôve started working in-person, going to restaurants, travelling and whatever. But the delta variant might change this risk calculation. Some of the same buzz that got covid right early on, the first time around, is now buzzing about delta potentially being very bad. ‚Ä¶)
[13:44:10] <nshepperd2> 'I was told by one of researchers that the risk side is accumulation of ‚Äúwrong antibodies‚Äù which may eventually target own tissues as autoimmune diseases. Any new shot increases this small risk. This is more true for complex vector vaccine like AZ, as they trigger generation of antibodies not only to carrier but also to vector. Anyway, I
[13:44:10] <nshepperd2> already got third shot of a vector vaccine.' heh

[19:02:28] <RiversHaveWings> I updated it to support init images btw
[19:02:31] <feep> oo
[19:02:40] <feep> can you do zoom
[19:02:52] <feep> actually, *lateral* zoom would be cool.
[19:03:12] <RiversHaveWings> zoom how?
[19:03:14] <feep> er, s/lateral zoom/panning/ "also called a"
[19:03:30] <feep> RiversHaveWings: some people made zoomed animations by just rescaling the image bigger while I think updating with a constant learning rate or sth
[19:03:36] <RiversHaveWings> oh
[19:03:41] <RiversHaveWings> idk if you can with diffusion
[19:04:02] <feep> well I mean, features get smaller as it progresses, right?
[19:04:05] <RiversHaveWings> bc of the dependence on initial conditions
[19:04:06] <nshepperd> like, shifting the image to the left every couple of steps, and filling in the gap with something?
[19:04:07] <feep> generally
[19:04:17] <feep> nshepperd: yeah
[19:05:00] <RiversHaveWings> the init images for diffusion are combined with the appropriate level of noise and then diffusion is started at an intermediate timestep
[19:05:21] <feep> right, I think zoom would just work the same way, right?
[19:05:41] <RiversHaveWings> temporal consistency is going to be a problem
[19:05:44] <nshepperd> can you do conditional diffusion? hold part of the image constant and generate the other half?
[19:05:46] <feep> or is the problem you would ... hn
[19:06:11] <feep> RiversHaveWings: I mean, hang on, does the network keep state across steps *other than* the image?
[19:06:19] <RiversHaveWings> no
[19:06:19] <feep> ie. does it keep activations or something
[19:06:42] <RiversHaveWings> but the gradient I condition diffusion with is not deterministic due to GPU stuff
[19:06:52] <feep> okay then .. like, if we're assuming it's reached convergence, then shouldn't it just work to keep the diffusion timestep at "close to max" and just do zoom, step, zoom, step, zoom, step?
[19:07:10] <RiversHaveWings> you're just going to get blur is the problem
[19:07:18] <RiversHaveWings> you have to rewind a *lot* of steps, like 500
[19:07:30] <feep> mh
[19:07:37] <feep> oh
[19:07:42] <feep> and then you won't get the same descent again
[19:07:44] <feep> I get it
[19:07:55] <RiversHaveWings> there might be some way but it doesn't occur to me rn
[19:08:39] <feep> something like...
[19:08:46] <RiversHaveWings> i need to do @silvio's other optimization now that i forked the diffusion repo to allow init images
[19:08:56] <feep> take the center square of the image, blow up by a factor of 2, like, a big one, rerun from 500, repeat
[19:09:05] <feep> then glue it together into a zoom shot semi-manually
[19:09:10] <RiversHaveWings> that would take the process from 2 forward passes + 1 backward per timestep to 1 forward + 1 backward
[19:09:32] <feep> or even more than 2
[19:09:48] <RiversHaveWings> you could try that
[19:10:02] <feep> mh nh, you'd get discontinuities all over the place
[19:10:20] <RiversHaveWings> you would need to fade the small image in as you zoomed
[19:10:25] <RiversHaveWings> and it would look visibly fade-y

[20:03:08] <RiversHaveWings> Let me look
[20:04:48] <RiversHaveWings> oh, there isn't, it's to modify pred_xstart
[20:04:54] <nshepperd2> it seems to be important to add the appropriate level of noise for the timestep
[20:04:57] <RiversHaveWings> Yeah
[20:05:05] <RiversHaveWings> It will wreck diffusion otherwise

[20:25:55] <RiversHaveWings> Ah
[20:29:23] <nshepperd2> i guess the noise destroys too much of the masked part during the early timesteps. it couldn't really see what it was supposed to be conditioning on until the later steps

[21:31:08] <nshepperd2> though it doesn't really help with the large scale structure being not completely related

[21:36:06] <gwern> nshepperd2: strictly speaking, I don't see any reason you couldn't use non-homogenous noise, it's just a different bit of noising applied... although I dunno what the math says
[21:36:30] * feep puts a checkmark on that feature
[21:36:37] <feep> still needs int i <- foo; declarations.
[21:36:37] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: i suspect it would do something weird in the output
[21:37:02] <nshepperd> when i tried it with no noise the sampling collapsed
[21:37:16] <gwern> my thinking is that if you applied highly varied noise patterns, the U-net might have to do more thinking work to figure out which part it wants to denoise more heavily, but it doesn't seem impossible
[21:37:35] <RiversHaveWings> if it were trained that way

[21:37:57] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: yeah, that's what I was replying to
[21:38:00] <nshepperd> what's the difference between the p method and ddim method
[21:38:01] <RiversHaveWings> ahh
[21:38:25] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd: ddim is faster and i think deterministic but it doesn't give me nice clean pred_xstarts to feed to CLIP
[21:39:12] <nshepperd> i see
[21:39:30] <RiversHaveWings> it tends to have inconsistent quality when guided by CLIP
[21:39:41] <RiversHaveWings> at least w/ my current methods.
[21:40:03] <RiversHaveWings> but you can use DDIM schedules as short as 25 steps?
[21:40:11] <RiversHaveWings> if you are not using CLIP guidance
[21:40:23] <gwern> (CLIP has a weird way of seeing the world. it may not be DDIM's problem, we should always recall, it may just be CLIP being CLIP)
[21:40:41] <RiversHaveWings> the intermediate pred_xstarts are actually kinda bad
[21:41:06] <RiversHaveWings> you are supposed to have a noise level conditioned classifier to use with DDIM
[21:41:39] <RiversHaveWings> so you don't have to feed pred_xstart to it
[21:41:42] <RiversHaveWings> but x_t

[21:45:41] <nshepperd> hmm. so if i mask out the samples with noisy init_image, and pred_xstart with the original init image, it should make clip a bit more smarter about the guidance
[21:46:53] <nshepperd> the clip gradient would be fully conditional, even though the diffusion gradient wouldn't be due to noise

[23:30:17] <two2thehead> My favourite story this weekend was the very successful ‚Äúget vaxed, get a sausage‚Äù campaign in the German state of Thuringia running into flak from opponents who felt it was unfair to all the people who had already had a vaccine shot without getting a free sausage
[23:30:24] <two2thehead> It's just the Wurst :V
[23:30:54] <dbohdan> *groan*
[23:31:08] <two2thehead> dbohdan, pls!
[23:31:19] <two2thehead> Societal Equity is very important!
[23:31:39] <dbohdan> Sausage equity
[23:32:06] <two2thehead> same
[23:34:57] <kuudes> I don't think we have much vaccine hesitancy, we just don't have much vaccines :-/
[23:35:15] <kuudes> if only we could manage to keep the virus in bay until october or so :-(
[23:35:51] <two2thehead> why october? that's when it gets colder in the northern hemisphere
[23:36:00] <two2thehead> Dec, Jan, Feb is winter iirc
[23:36:51] <kuudes> by october we would get possibly to 90% of 2 dosed
[23:37:04] <kuudes> we get about 300k doses per week
[23:37:24] <two2thehead> ah, and the vaccine-supply is the only limitation. Gotcha
[23:37:27] <kuudes> which is about 5.5% of population
[23:37:28] <kuudes> yeah
[23:37:32] <two2thehead> bottleneck, I should say

[23:39:16] <kuudes> is he from africa
[23:39:37] <two2thehead> no, no. That's Chadian
[23:41:02] <kuudes> chad country is landlocked unlike virgin islands
[23:41:53] <two2thehead> No, no. That just means Chad is socially comfortable and close with his friends :-))

[23:44:04] <catern> Betawolf: lmao
[23:44:25] <catern> oh you didn't just come up with that
[23:44:30] <catern> well, good addition
[23:44:39] <Betawolf> it's kuudes' really.
[23:45:18] <catern> it's better than that version two2thehead linked

[23:51:41] <catern> is it insufferable and lame for me to basically just link to my relevant blog posts in discussions and when making comments?
[23:52:06] <catern> e.g. https://lobste.rs/s/j18lvd/heptagon_configuration_software#c_dsbevu
[23:52:06] <Robomot> Heptagon of Configuration (Software Engineering) | Lobsters []
[23:52:12] <gwern> I do it all the time, but I do think mine are worth linking
[23:52:32] <adiabatic> catern: you ought to introduce your blog post with like a sentence or two, if only to say "I wrote up a bunch of ideas on this very theme"
[23:53:21] <catern> gwern: hmm well I don't at all think it's insufferable and lame when you do it, but that's because you're high status
[23:53:30] <catern> maybe
[23:53:44] <catern> adiabatic: yeah I do do that...
[23:53:45] <dbohdan> I think it's fine, but I second what adiabatic said.  It needs a few more sentences of context for the link.
[23:55:21] <gwern> yeah, that's just basic politeness. even a sentence summarizing it, if the title doesn't, or laying out more detail about how exactly it connects
[23:55:49] <catern> true, true, true...
[23:56:27] <catern> yeah okay there was probably not enough context in that post
[23:56:37] <catern> but if I put enough context, it's fine? that's reassuring
[23:56:46] <catern> um, not enough context in that comment, I mean
[23:57:21] <adiabatic> also if your main point is buried in the middle of your blog post, have subheaders or other intra-document linking that you can use to link to a particular paragraph, or at least get comfortable telling people "ctrl-f for‚Ä¶"
[23:57:41] <gwern> true, I make a point of having lots of very precise links

[23:58:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is super relevant to my interests, let's see what Scott says...
[23:58:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Anosmia sucks worse than you would expect." yes :(
[23:58:24] <catern> adiabatic: agreed, but do you know about http://catern.com/config.html#:~:text=This%20programmatic%20modification
[23:58:25] <Robomot> Write code, not configuration
[23:58:26] <adiabatic> sense of smell, right? becaus eyou don't seem like the acid type
[23:58:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[23:58:33] <adiabatic> catern: that's a Chromeism
[23:58:40] <catern> adiabatic: yeah but it's useful :)
[23:59:04] <gwern> the LSD/smell thing is a pretty weird one. there's a lot of smoke, so I suspect there's something there. it's just so weird and out of the norm. I don't think I've ever encountered an anecdote about something other than LSD doing that
[23:59:11] <adiabatic> For Chrome people, sure.
[23:59:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> "By the end of a year 95%+ have recovered" ... ok, that makes me feel better
[23:59:42] <kuudes> lsd seems to me to turn up the temperature parameter
[23:59:54] <gwern> true, but you could say that of a lot of psyechedelics
[23:59:59] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: your sense of smell still AWOL?
[23:59:59] <kuudes> yeah, I guess
