[02:30:26] <sasano> I guess if the firmware in the maskrom is small enough that it can be reviewed it shouldn't be too bad that it can't be changed

[02:31:03] <tpefreedom> But smaller?
[02:31:21] <clever> tpefreedom: x86 bios tends to be stored on external flash chips, so it can be changed
[02:31:36] <DiffieHellman> If a piece of software is burned into hardware and such is verified not to be malicious, it can be treated as a circuit.

[02:34:42] <clever> sasano: for the entire VC4 lineup (pi0 to pi3), the maskrom can boot from 8 sources: https://github.com/librerpi/rpi-open-firmware/blob/master/docs/rom.txt#L11-L33
[02:34:59] <clever> sasano: each one is enabled by a different bit in OTP memory, which you can dump, to see what sources are enabled
[02:35:21] <clever> sasano: for each source, it will try to load bootcode.bin, and if found, execute it, then the rom ceases to have control
[02:35:30] <sasano> DiffieHellman, well I understand that rule, however some maskroms are sophisticated enough that they run a small OS, and while sometimes they are not malicious, they can have a vulnerability that you can't patch.
[02:35:40] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: No sadly. Cheapest PPC "computer" with a checked boot{rom,loader} is a Wii I guess.
[02:36:40] <tpefreedom> Or an old ppc mac
[02:37:55] <DiffieHellman> sasano: Depends on the vulnerability really. Sometimes such vulnerability is useful, as it allows you to flash your own 2nd stage bootloader. Such is only really a problem if such maskrom likes to boot things from the internet I guess.
[02:39:18] <tpefreedom> *intel boot agent*
[02:39:19] <sasano> clever, I see.
[02:39:51] <tpefreedom> I disabled NIC boot completely to turn off that BS on my new refurbished laptop.
[02:39:58] <clever> sasano: for the pi3, step 6 (usb-device) was modified slightly, to also support usb-host, where it can then either access a usb stick, or use tftp over the internal usb nic

[02:40:38] *** Joins: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247)
[02:41:06] <clever> sasano: the pi4 radically overhauls all of that, and only 3 options remain, recovery.bin on SD, bootcode.bin in SPI, or usb-device mode
[02:41:22] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: I hope it doesn't have AMT - certain AMT enabled computers (from like 2011) have zeroconfig enabled by default - even if AMT is disabled in the BIOS.
[02:41:56] *** Joins: lazzurs (~lazzurs@user/lazzurs)

[02:52:04] <clever> https://github.com/librerpi/lk-overlay/tree/master/app/signing-dump
[02:52:21] <clever> sasano: but my LK code includes an app that can dump the keys on demand, if your on a compatible maskrom
[02:52:30] <clever> so if you have a pi4 in your posession, you can dump your own keys
[02:52:53] <clever> that requires loading an unsigned start4.elf, using the already signed (and closed-source) SPI firmware
[02:53:08] <clever> start4.elf isnt verified by default, so you can execute whatever you want from there
[02:53:36] <clever> the process to make start4.elf be verified, is behind NDA, so ive given up even asking on the forums
[02:53:59] <clever> anybody that can answer that, would get into legal trouble by doing so

[03:01:39] <sasano> this is an example of a malicious maskrom
[03:02:42] <clever> ?
[03:04:17] <sasano> if a maskrom stops you from installing your modified version of the software by cryptographic checks it is considered a malicious circuit
[03:04:26] <clever> ah
[03:04:48] <clever> for the VC4 series (pi0-pi3), that check is disabled by default
[03:05:01] <clever> so its not a threat until some malicious actor effectively bricks your pi
[03:05:31] <clever> for the bcm2835 (pi0/pi1), there is a timing exploit, that can let you guess the signature
[03:06:08] <clever> for the pi4/pi400/cm4, the signed firmware will happily run unsigned firmware, then you can dump the keys, and the signing is effectively pointless
[03:07:03] <clever> sasano: which ones would you still consider malicious?
[03:09:04] <sasano> clever, the pi4 series where sig checking is enabled and you don't have the keys
[03:09:31] <joepublic> okay, the 128 bit key you dump gets xor'd with another key in the maskrom.  then what?
[03:09:45] <clever> joepublic: hmac-sha1
[03:09:59] <sasano> clever, if you can circumvent it you it is still malicious, you have simply circumvented the malice

[03:10:21] <clever> joepublic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC
[03:10:47] <clever> joepublic: xor a constant with the key, then sha1(thatresult ++ payload)
[03:11:04] <clever> joepublic: then xor the original key with a different constant, and sha1(thatresult ++ previoushash)
[03:11:15] <clever> that 2nd hash, is the signature
[03:11:47] <clever> for hmac-sha1, its a 20 byte signature
[03:13:35] <clever> joepublic: once you have the key material, you can sign a .bin file with this tool: https://github.com/librerpi/rpi-tools/blob/master/signing-tool/sign.js

[15:18:47] <kaiod> Actually, I have the option to take the printed materials, but the exams are online. So in this case, even if the school gave me these alternatives, it wouldn't solve the case. Also, I am fully aware of the risks and problems with the priority software, I think of the other students not even knowing what they are doing with their data.
[15:20:13] <DiffieHellman> How online are these exams? Can you just show up to a location to take the exam>
[15:20:34] <kompowiec2[x]> in my opinion, it is not worth making them aware because the matter is lost in advance.

[15:22:42] <kompowiec2[x]> and ask for an alternative, eg. Psyhical exam
[15:22:52] <kaiod> The exams are 100% online, on a platform made by the state. Only the student and the teacher can access it, there is no printed option. And by the way, if I claimed there was no way to do it on my devices, they would tell me to use the school computer at a pre-arranged time.
[15:23:15] <DiffieHellman> kompowiec2[x]: I tend to not bother in the most case only because lots of normies have grown to love proprietary software for unknown reasons. Online, though...

[22:39:39] <scara> Whenever I go to a website like fsf or even stallman, I see weird formats like .ogv and .midi, I asume those formats are free? Does FSF maintain a list of formats?
[22:39:40] *** Joins: mulin-c (~mulin-c@dynamic-170-245-37-221.fibramaxbandalarga.com.br)
[22:41:32] <joepublic> there is a file format collection page in the free software directory, not exhaustive, listing common file formats.  https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Collection:File_format
[22:41:46] <bandali> ogv, ogg, webm, etc are patent-unencumbered indeed. there's https://audio-video.gnu.org/docs/formatguide.html fwiw but may not be exactly what you're looking for
[22:44:44] <scara> Thank you
