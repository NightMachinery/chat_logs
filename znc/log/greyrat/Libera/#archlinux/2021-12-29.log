[03:36:46] <mick> Hi, I have a question concerning https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide#Install_essential_packages
[03:36:46] <mick> When it says "The base package does not include all tools from the live installation ... In particular, consider installing: "
[03:36:46] <mick> Do I have to install additional packages during installation using `pacstrap` or could I install it later after reboot with pacman ?
[03:36:46] <mick> Also, they don't provide any example of required package for file system, firmware, networking, text editor or man pages. Could it be better to provide example of commonly used packages ? Do you have a list of those packages that should be installed ?

[11:25:19] <h4rd3n3D_> amosbird: alternatively; Network Time Protocol is the most common method to synchronize the software clock of a GNU/Linux system with internet time servers. It is designed to mitigate the effects of variable network latency and can usually maintain time to within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet. The accuracy on local area networks is even better, up to one millisecond.

[15:24:38] <oprypin> I'm using KDE. I had set up GPG so that when signing a Git commit it didn't ask me for a GPG password. Now that I set everything up on a new computer, it asks me for the password every time. I don't remember what I had done that let it not ask me, and can't find again. Did I somehow save that in KWallet? I don't see such an option in the popup  https://i.imgur.com/jsxffpP.png
[15:28:38] *** Joins: blindguard (~blindguar@2a02:908:1864:c200::12)
[15:29:43] <grawity> the popup only supports libsecret (which is typically backed by gnome-keyring, and occassionally by KeePassXC, but unfortunately not by kwallet)
[15:30:02] <grawity> I mean kde did have plans for libsecret support, but that was 10 years ago
[15:31:27] <oprypin> Mhm.  At this point it seems more likely that I did some very insecure solution such as removing the password from it.  And I'm sure "pinentry-kwallet" (that I'm running across now) wasn't involved.
[15:32:06] <grawity> never heard of pinentry-kwallet
[15:32:26] <grawity> though makes sense for it to exist
[15:32:53] <grawity> but it's not part of standard pinentry, only a generic pinentry-qt is

[20:50:04] <grawity> it's not really critical, though very old tools used to default to 63 which just didn't make any sense in modern hardware... but that still only loses some performance, doesn't *break* anything really

And <1B/s over 10s (or whatever the period is now) is with near full certainity equivalent to “connection lost”, not merely being sluggish — so there is rarely anything to wait for.

[23:18:47] <OverCoder> mpan, by the way my phone which is on the same network stack seems to work fine with arch.nixlab.pl
[23:18:52] <OverCoder> my computer is being stupid
[23:18:55] <OverCoder> that's the conclusion
[23:18:56] * OverCoder hates linux now
[23:19:22] <Dieterbe> wunit, Ghosthree3 : turns out i3 -V (verbose mode) is what i needed, and more. it logs all window events, renames, etc, and tells me how it applies all my matching rules. super cool. thanks both!
[23:19:24] <OverCoder> this is why I keep leaning over buying a Mac despite the insane cost
[23:19:36] <OverCoder> Mac just works, using linux for a PC is like signing up for a full time sys admin job

[23:28:10] <mpan> OverCoder: let’s put it like this. On Arch you could get response from people, who can peek into the code and at least eliminate some possibilities or suggest ways to circumvent the problem. Not to mention #archlinux contains devs themselves. :P

[23:52:57] <MrElendig> or you can start the whole steam ui from the terminal
[23:53:27] <MrElendig> you can also start the game binary directly without starting steam, that sometimes works better than starting the game trough steam if the steam install itself is semi-borked
[23:53:45] <MrElendig> (mostly a problem with non-native games though)
[23:54:30] <samson-Arch> well csgo is native linux game  will try now from terminal start to see what error will give
