[01:58:37] <Gnuman> Skyz, ok.... what is your question?
[01:58:54] <Skyz> Well, I'm wondering how viable go is a language
[01:59:09] <seebs> things are written in it and they run?
[01:59:12] <seebs> so, i guess viable enough
[02:00:15] <Skyz> The POC is what gets me though cuz I don't get the gc
[02:00:33] <Skyz> Is gc a problem for low-level?
[02:01:40] <Gnuman> Skyz, The company I work at uses Go for nearly everything on the back-end. It's fast, it scales well, and it's simple to learn. I wouldn't use it to program an operating system or anything low-level (like kernel programming), but you'll have to evaluate that for yourself. Most low-level stuff is done in C/assembly, or maybe Rust.
[02:01:47] <rudi_s> Skyz: What do you consider low-level?
[02:02:14] <src> src: because I'm probably doing something stupid, though I didn't do it in the end

[02:02:40] <Gnuman> src, ah, understood =)
[02:02:51] <src> got another question, something like https://play.golang.org/ simply doesn't work, short variable declarations in conditional statements? example is just for illustration, not real world code example
[02:03:16] <src> * https://play.golang.org/p/PrtKa4QY9rK
[02:03:43] <rudi_s> src: You have to declare y before the if.
[02:03:45] <b0nn> just scope
[02:03:54] <seebs> What do you mean by "low-level"? What do you mean "a problem"?
[02:04:02] <Gnuman> src, right, because `y` goes out of scope right after the if block ends.
[02:04:04] <src> b0nn: oh I see, that explains it
[02:04:06] <b0nn> what do you mean by what do you mean
[02:04:14] <seebs> Does GC have a non-zero cost in CPU time and memory? Yes. Does it prevent us from writing backend code? No.
[02:04:57] <seebs> I wouldn't probably be sold on it for a kernel language but I dunno, maybe with some adaptation. TinyGo targets some very small boards.
[02:06:58] <Tv_> Skyz: you can write a kernel with gc if you're careful, it's been done
[02:07:44] <Tv_> Go wouldn't be my #1 choice for that task for writing a kernel in, but it's possible and been done
[02:09:29] <seebs> it'd be easier to respond to a more concrete statement of what the question/concern is.
[02:10:18] <Skyz> How do I get paid to write a kernel?
[02:10:27] <seebs> in general you don't
[02:10:39] <seebs> you might be able to get paid to work on a kernel if there's an existing one you want to work on
[02:11:05] <Tv_> step 1: rewind time to the 90s
[02:11:14] <seebs> basically, "write a kernel" is either a hobby project that doesn't pay, or something being funded by something the size of Google (see, e.g., fuchsia).
[02:11:26] <Tv_> seebs: fuchsia's kernel started as a hobby project afaik
[02:11:44] <Tv_> these days the best most likely way to get paid to write a kernel is academia
[02:11:45] <seebs> i'm curious now
[02:12:07] <Skyz> 90s rewind
[02:12:18] <Tv_> you won't be funded to continue working on it after the paper is published though ;)

[02:38:33] <Tv_> seebs: symbian was kinda stupid limited. Nokia had great prototypes running Linux at the time, but my conspiracy theory is they couldn't do much with those because they were publicly and/or contractually committed to symbian
[02:38:56] <seebs> i liked the psion back in the day, and i honestly think a big part of what killed them was bluetooth
[02:39:15] <seebs> they had no USB support at all, of any kind, for years, and every year they'd say "yeah, we know the serial port thing sucks, but bluetooth will fix that", and then bluetooth was like five years late

[02:39:59] <seebs> not totally surprised. well i guess slightly.
[02:40:13] <seebs> because i have never yet had an android phone that didn't have incomprehensibly stupid problems.
[02:40:42] <seebs> open phone app. bring up keypad. press two or three numbers. phone delays up to a second then rushes out the first couple of numbers all at once in playing them back, because there is no mechanism by which it could respond more quickly than that.

[02:43:30] <seebs> i just honestly can't even imagine what's happening. does the phone app need half a second to get access to audio? is it loading predefined files from media rather than synthesizing the touch tone sounds? WHO KNOWS.
[02:43:34] <Tv_> but it's tricky, because you normally need the app involved to get the screen to paint right, and it's just yet another process on a linux box

[03:30:35] <Tv_> Wessie: that seems overly bureaucratic and hard to understand, with that many channels
[03:31:11] <Tv_> Wessie: why not just send function values to a background runner?
[03:32:33] <Tv_> Wessie: you can make the sender not block by having the background runner receive them and put them into an unbuffered queue in a local variable, and do the actual work in a yet another goroutine, with a for { select {
[03:33:09] <Tv_> but that's a fixed number of channels and very straight forward functions

[05:17:58] <StankDusky> I'm a go newbie exploring the Gif library source code. I'm confused by the beginning of the decode() function here. How exactly is it checking for ReadByte() when the Reader interface only asks for Read()? Link: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/bcecae2af6ee43abebf84411385d538ec4e7d0ea/src/image/gif/reader.go#L219

[05:23:23] <KirkMcDonald> StankDusky: It's checking whether the type assertion `r.(reader)` succeeds, where `reader` is defined here: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/bcecae2af6ee43abebf84411385d538ec4e7d0ea/src/image/gif/reader.go#L27

[11:48:07] <gpeskens[w]> Anyone know how I can prevent an os.Pipe to return EOF? I need to interface with a library that takes a fd to which it sends 1 byte notifications, if I just do Read on the returned file from os.Pipe it eventually returns an EOF err, while that is technically not true (it's just not yet ready for reading)

[11:53:28] <alb> gpeskens[w]: is that the EOF signaling to the reader that there are no more writers that have the pipe open? I don't recall the details from memory but there are very particular semantics about pipes around that (not Go specific, just in general)

[11:54:35] <rudi_s> gpeskens[w]: Are you sure that the write end isn't closed? Pipes should only return EOF when that happens.
[11:54:39] <gpeskens[w]> Yea I just figured it out as well ;) Since my code doesn't use the writer directly except to extract the FD from, golang will GC the writer somewhere int he body of my for loop
[11:55:22] <gpeskens[w]> There was a way to keep a variable alive in an idiomatic way, but I have forgotten it :/
[11:55:43] <rudi_s> gpeskens[w]: Global variable?
[11:55:46] <gpeskens[w]> no
[11:55:48] <rudi_s> Not sure if that's idiomatic.
[11:56:43] <gpeskens[w]> No Golang can decide to GC variables that are not referenced anywhere later, closing the pipe etc. There is a way to prevent that in an idiomatic way but I forgot it
[11:56:56] <gpeskens[w]> As a work around I just close the writer post loop
[11:57:08] <gpeskens[w]> that way it get's referenced somewhere past where I need it to exist
[11:57:12] <gpeskens[w]> And it doesn't get GC'd

[12:01:36] <rudi_s> So no finalizers will be executed for global variables and they won't be gced.
[12:01:56] <rudi_s> Ah, misread you ... I wanted to say "use global variable" ;-)
[12:01:58] <gpeskens[w]> At the start of my function I open a selfpipe, pass the write end to a C library, then read the readend in a for loop
[12:02:11] <rudi_s> But in your case KeepAlive is obviously the proper solution.

[20:48:27] <Tv_> and the "look for it in parent dirs" logic sometimes is utterly unhelpful
[20:48:48] <Tv_> and redo the python project is actually crazy slow when you start having lots of these tasks
[20:48:58] <icholy> the windows devs always complain about makefiles
[20:49:39] <icholy> I've switched to having a make.go with // +build make
[20:50:12] <jawn-smith> I'm seeing some odd behavior with buildmode=pie. When I don't use it, go build creates an executable, but when I add buildmode=pie go build creates a shared object instead. Any idea why that might be?
