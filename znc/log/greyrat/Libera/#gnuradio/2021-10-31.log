[00:32:20] <johncc3_> Hi all. I've been updating my old GRC installation and have been battling to get it working. First I tried to install 3.9.3, which I finally could compile but after a while I detected it wasn't supporting rtlsdr/cosmosdr (read something that a driver has yet to be ported to python3) Please correct me at any mmoment...
[00:33:22] <johncc3_> So I went back to 3.8.4, got it compiled ok, tried to install several versions of osmosdr, but had compilation issues:
[00:34:11] <johncc3_>   Target "osmosdr_swig" links to target "gnuradio::gnuradio-blocks" but the target was not found.
[00:35:21] <johncc3_> I found several references to that issue being solved in osmosdr-0.2.2 but could find the source code for that version.
[00:36:06] <johncc3_> Help!
[00:38:57] <johncc3_> Correction: ...but could NOT find the source...
[00:41:49] <drmpeg> ClaytonargiloVE3: Are you around?
[00:42:07] <ClaytonargiloVE3> Yep.
[00:43:15] <miek> johncc3_: which versions of gr-osmosdr did you try and build for use with gr 3.8.4?
[00:43:18] <drmpeg> I've started my ATSC 3.0 transmitter project. But I always have a difficult time reading the spec. So I have an equation question for you.
[00:44:20] <johncc3_> miek, gr-osmosdr-gr3.8 and the latest git
[00:44:56] <drmpeg> Here's the spec. https://muygs2x2vhb2pjk6g160f1s8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/A322-2021-Physical-Layer-Protocol.pdf
[00:45:54] <drmpeg> I'm trying to implement section 6.1.3.1
[00:46:43] <drmpeg> And there's this equation I'm pretty sure I have wrong.
[00:48:04] <drmpeg> M1 + {(x - M1 + m x Q2)} mod M2
[00:48:48] <drmpeg> And I have that coded as:
[00:49:29] <drmpeg> p[m1 + ((ldpc_tab_2_15N[row][col] - m1 + (m * q2)) % m2)]
[00:49:37] <johncc3_> miek, and tried gr-osmosdr-0.2.0 too.
[00:50:13] <drmpeg> But I wonder what those braces mean.
[00:51:28] <ClaytonargiloVE3> Sometimes equations are written with different styles of parentheses as different layers, so it could be that.
[00:52:52] <ClaytonargiloVE3> I expect your code is correct.
[00:53:54] <drmpeg> Okay, more debugging then.
[00:54:23] <johncc3_> drmpeg, Completely ignorant about the protocol. I did sin against cols/rows being inverted once. Is that a possibility?
[00:54:49] <drmpeg> i don't think so.
[00:55:34] <drmpeg> Clayton, are you interested in helping out on the project, or are you too busy at work?
[00:56:57] <drmpeg> I was able to get the complete validation and verification files from ATSC.
[01:01:38] <ClaytonargiloVE3> I would be interested in helping out. I recently moved and now live within range of an ATSC 3.0 station (WMYD), so I've been thinking about ATSC 3.0. I don't have a receiver yet but might grab a HDHomeRun FLEX 4K.
[01:02:35] <ClaytonargiloVE3> I'd love to see ATSC 3.0 tx (& rx!) in GNU Radio.
[01:02:50] <drmpeg> Cool. I have a few blocks implemented already.
[01:03:51] <drmpeg> Some it's exactly like DVB-T2, so I've been able to take advantage of that.
[01:04:22] <drmpeg> But some of it is different, like the stuff I just posted.
[01:06:37] <drmpeg> I can put what I have on Github. I'm stuck in two blocks right now.
[01:07:13] <drmpeg> And have three blocks finished.
[01:08:26] <drmpeg> And there's still a lot to go.
[01:10:49] <drmpeg> After I put it on Github, I'll send you an e-mail with all the details.
[01:11:09] <ClaytonargiloVE3> üëçÔ∏è

[04:28:32] <muaddib[m]> drmpeg: mentioned the tune command for UHD. IIRC you call the API function in the frequency parameter of the UHD sink. I usually open the examples in gr-ieee80211 when i want to reference it cause i know it‚Äôs used there.
[04:29:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> UHD.tune_request(freq,offset)
[04:30:39] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also on B2xx make sure your bandwidth setting is large enough to account for the offset. That bites me from time to time.

[16:54:26] <johncc3_> No problem. Have been struggling for several days ;-(
[16:58:48] <drmpeg> With the new CMake, there's a find_package debugging option. Just add -DCMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE=ON to your CMake invocation.

[17:07:53] <drmpeg> Yeah, it's pretty verbose.

[17:49:12] <Hoernchen> cmakes package finding is not related to pkgconfig, it looks for .cmake files in the usual places
[17:49:33] <Hoernchen> i.e. /usr/local/lib/cmake
[17:50:42] <Hoernchen> and those cmake files might then use pkgconfig
[17:55:41] <johncc3_> Hoernchen, Thanks for the info. How does cmake/find_package know where to look for the cmakes? I did find a cmake dir in /usr/lib64
[17:57:00] <Hoernchen> well, CMAKE_MODULE_PATH or CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH can be used to convey non-default locations...
[17:57:31] <Hoernchen> i don't know anything about slack, but your best bet is to use cmake-gui to manipulate the paths until they point at the right dir
[17:59:28] <Hoernchen> it's a lla  pile of cards, there might even be a problem with cmake finding the cmake file, trying to use pkgconfig, but pkgconfig also needs a custom path...
[18:02:10] <johncc3_> Never really had so many problems with cmake... Seeing cmake-gui now
[18:03:32] <Hoernchen> you're honestly the first person using slack that i've been aware of during the past, uh, 10 years of gr stuff..

[18:05:54] <Hoernchen> yes, as expected
[18:08:10] <johncc3_> should CMAKE_MODULE_PATH be defined as a string?
[18:09:22] <Hoernchen> i suppose so, it's just a semicolon separated list

[18:15:05] <willcode4[m]> v3.9.4.0 is released. This fixes a couple regression in v3.9.3.0 and add useful stuff recently added to master.
[18:15:25] <johncc3_> Ah... It even detected Gnuradio_DIR as /usr/lib64/cmake/gnuradio
[18:15:30] <Hoernchen> well i kinda expect it to be aware of slackware defaults, but for some reason those do not suffice to let it find your blocks
[18:18:34] <johncc3_> So, it seems the problem is localized in gr-osmosdr-gr38. 
[18:20:18] <johncc3_> And compare with gr_osmosdr-0.2.0 which does compile (and I suspect is newer).
[18:21:43] <Hoernchen> can you just checkout https://github.com/osmocom/gr-osmosdr/tree/gr3.8 and give that a try? i have no idea what people are packaging..

[19:37:17] <johncc3_> miek, There's a python dir in build, with nothing but a CMakeLists.txt and __init__.py
[19:37:40] <johncc3_> Sorry...
[19:38:54] <johncc3_> in the project root is that python dir... In build/ is one with CTestTestfile.cmake cmake_install.cmake Makefile

[22:28:36] <johncc3_> Guys, I need another hand. On GR 3.8.4, with gr-osmosdr-gr38 successfully compiled and installed, I cannot seem to import
[22:29:12] <johncc3_> osmosdr in Python. The error I get is: ImportError: /usr/lib64/libgnuradio-osmosdr.so.0.2.0: undefined symbol: _ZN2gr12msg_accepter4postEN5boost13intrusive_ptrIN3pmt8pmt_baseEEES5_
[22:29:46] <johncc3_> I understand that that symbol after c++filt really means: gr::msg_accepter::post(boost::intrusive_ptr<pmt::pmt_base>, boost::intrusive_ptr<pmt::pmt_base>)
[22:30:12] <johncc3_> How do I solve this?
[22:31:41] <funkylab[m]> looks like you've linked against a different version of GNU Radio
[22:33:19] <johncc3_> funkylab[m], Gnuradio is 3.8.4, 'home' compiled. No doubt there. How do I check the rest?
[22:34:55] <funkylab[m]> Ok, need to rephrase: the : /usr/lib64/libgnuradio-osmosdr.so.0.2.0 you're using **is** linked against a different version of GNU Radio, the error means exactly that. Why was it installed to /usr/lib64 if it was home-compiled? Is it maybe not actually the thing you've home-compiled but the library from your Linux distro, and you have that installed "in conflict" with your self-build version?
[22:36:53] <johncc3_> Slackware installs by defect in /usr/lib64. GR is working well, I only need the module for gr-osmosdr.
[22:37:16] <johncc3_> 'by defect' <- by default...
[22:37:21] <funkylab[m]> :) 
[22:38:15] *** Quits: Macuser (~Macuser@216.30.159.201) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz‚Ä¶)
[22:39:19] <johncc3_> So I created a 'slackbuild' package to compile GR 3.8.4 and it compiled (and runs) cleanly. I also compile rtlsdr without issues (test programs run fine)
[22:39:28] <funkylab[m]> again, nothing you say changes the fact that the library you're trying to use was *not* built against the version of the GNU Radio library found on your system, there's no disputing that!
[22:39:28] <funkylab[m]> Can you please try to build this all in a clean container? Trying to package for a currently unsupported distro and then having multiple versions of dependencies installed, that's really just going to lead to tears
[22:40:33] <funkylab[m]> I don't know anything about slackbuild, so I can't tell what that means. But if it's an isolated environment, then that would solve the issue that you're building libgniuradio-osmosdr against a different version of gnuradio than what is found at runtime.
[22:42:28] <johncc3_> Is there no way to find out which part is causing this issue? The problem is not directly with GR. If start python3 and do a simple import osmosdr, I get the same problem.
[22:42:56] <funkylab[m]> But I told you what is causing the issue, two times now?
[22:45:22] <johncc3_> Ok. I'll try and find out where if there are old libs laying around. Cheers
[22:45:40] <funkylab[m]> :) Cheers!
