[22:22:06] <kurahaupo> bin: "expected value" has a specific meaning in statistics, and numerically it equates exactly to the mean or average over the relevant population. So "life expectancy" is by definition what the "average person" will live to. What it's not is what "most people" will live to; that's basically the median, as a threshold value.

[22:24:24] <lall-> i would be surprised if there's stats so granular.
[22:24:29] <kurahaupo> Life expectancy goes up as one ages, since you've already survived the chance if death at a younger age. So at birth my life expectancy was about 77. Now it's about 84.
[22:25:29] <lall-> that's why people talk about averages, not individual
[22:25:50] <lall-> on all counts, japan seems to be leading
[22:26:11] <lall-> might be genetics, but i think there's nutritional factor there too.

[22:26:19] <kurahaupo> lall-: If the stats aren't fine grained, they'd be inaccurate and useless.
[22:26:19] <kurahaupo> btw "granular" means "lumpy", which is the opposite of fine-grained
[22:26:56] <lall-> most stats are inaccurate and useless, but it's all we got
[22:27:16] <bin> usually they just exclude data for deaths under 18, but it's been a long time since I've seen anything like that 
[22:27:48] <kurahaupo> lall-: age-at-death is pinpoint accurate in over 99% of cases, so it's not one of the "inaccurate and useless" stats
[22:29:01] <lall-> i meant that as stats in general, but in this case, yeah. i agree. japanese die older so there must be a reason
[22:31:14] <kurahaupo> The problem with statistics isn't that they're inaccurate; by definition they're accurate for whatever they measure. The problem is that they are often misrepresented as meaning something else. It's unhelpful to give blanket assertions like "they're all wrong" - or indeed "they're all correct"
[22:32:31] <lall-> it's a problem to be 2 dimensional
[22:33:21] <lall-> there was a pool in Thailand, about people approving or disapproving of opening of bars serving alcohol
[22:33:36] <lall-> statistically. it turned out tha tmost people don't want that to happen
[22:33:46] <kurahaupo> eg if you survey 100 people and ask them whether they will vote for bananas or onions in the upcoming election, then you have a 100% accurate statistic on "what people said when you asked them what they would vote for out of those two options"; what you don't have is what they would vote for given other options, or whether they will in fact vote as they said, or even vote at all
[22:33:46] <lall-> they questioned some 2000 people or so.
[22:34:00] <lall-> problem is they cherry picked people
[22:34:54] <lall-> that's a contextual problem, another is problem of bias
[22:36:35] <lall-> btw
[22:36:44] <kurahaupo> sampling methodology is understood by serious statisticians; that's why you don't trust conclusions written by untrained people 
[22:37:10] <lall-> as in?
[22:38:02] <kurahaupo> lall-: Really, most people. As I said, it's a misrepresentation problem
[22:38:45] <kurahaupo> We need people to be better trained in statistical analysis in high school
[22:38:50] <lall-> MOST people don't understand even basic math
[22:39:12] <lall-> so they turn around to the authority to tell them what to think, be that a doctor, politician or whatever
[22:39:14] <kurahaupo> lall-: And that's a heinous indictment of their education
[22:39:42] <lall-> you mean we need to train kids how to have critical thinking>
[22:40:41] <kurahaupo> "What's the point of me learning this hard math stuff, I'll never use it" → "It helps you to know if people are lying to you"
[22:42:22] <lall-> mmm. don't hav eto be college educated to know when somebody is full of crap.
[22:42:26] <kurahaupo> lall-: Critical thinking yes, but also enough understanding of statistical modelling to know when someone else's analysis is rubbish/fraudulent
[22:44:18] <kurahaupo> At least to the level of understanding false positive vs false negatives, and conditional probability
