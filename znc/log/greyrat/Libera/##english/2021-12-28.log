[02:41:49] <Jong> how is empirical evidence different from just evidence? The word "empirical" always felt redundant to me.
[02:49:09] <FLHerne> Jong: In modern English it's mostly just an intensifier
[02:50:51] <FLHerne> or (slightly incorrectly) used to mean controlled research rather than anecdotes or personal experience
[02:52:47] <FLHerne> Until sometime in the 1500-1700 A.D. period, it was widely considered that things could be proven by philosophical reasoning rather than observation
[02:54:00] <Jong> FLHerne  haha I remember learning that in school. There was a time people thought they could just sit in cave and think up the truth about the world without looking at the world
[02:54:09] <FLHerne> so, for example, the Five Ways described by Aquinas were evidence of the existence of God
[02:54:56] <FLHerne> or various theories of Aristotle and Galen
[02:55:33] <FLHerne> my favourite book on that is "The Invention of Science" by David Wootton
[02:55:53] <Jong> I think writing an essay showing the fallacies in Aquinas's arguments should be required for graduating high school. It's a good test to see who can see the truth beneath specious arguments
[02:56:02] <FLHerne> it's not just a history of the scientific revolution, but a description of how the language and societal attitudes changed
[02:57:53] <FLHerne> for example the appearance of the word "science" itself rather than "natural philosophy"
[02:58:45] <FLHerne> also the shift in meaning of 'evidence' as above and several other things
[03:01:01] <Skunky> Jong: and now, we've gone full circle, people sit in their houses and think up "truth" about the world and push it all over the internet...
[03:02:05] <Jong> FLHerne  I'm reading a sample of that book "The Invention of Science." What do you like so much about it?
[03:02:09] <xenial-user5> The truth is on the other side.
[03:04:14] <FLHerne> Jong: What I said already really -- that it's not a simple history of "then X invented Y and discovered Z", but a history of how the societal perception of truth and research changed, and how language changed with it
[03:05:13] <FLHerne> My criticism would be that it repeats itself a bit, and it spends a lot of time refuting certain post-modernist views that I consider too silly to be worth refuting :p

[13:37:33] <Skunky> hi
[13:38:23] <D4mned> hey Skunky
[13:39:40] <D4mned> im trying to write a resume cover letter 
[13:39:49] <Skunky> ooooooooo, good luck with that.
[13:39:54] <D4mned> lol
[13:40:03] <D4mned> thanks
[13:40:59] <Skunky> there are all kinds of guides all over google on writing a "killer cover letter", that I wish I'd been able to read when I was actually looking for a job. 
[13:41:24] <D4mned> can you give your opinion on what i wrote so far ? 
[13:41:58] <D4mned> yeah they are over the top for my situation i guess 
[13:43:29] <D4mned> im just searching the web for companies that are in my field of work and just sending resumes 
[13:43:32] <D4mned> left and right 
[13:43:47] <Skunky> yeah, you need a cover letter, or they won't even look at your resume, most of the time.
[13:44:17] <D4mned> they just have a career section on their pages with no specific opening, just saying to send your resume
[13:44:23] <D4mned> yeah 
[13:45:02] <Skunky> that makes it harder, in my opinion.  you need a "hi, I wanna work for you because .... " cover letter.  for that, you need to know why you'd possibly want to work for them.
[13:45:23] <D4mned> can i pm you ? 
[13:45:37] <D4mned> id like to paste a couple of lines and see what you think about it 
[13:45:46] <Skunky> i'm putting on clothes and walking out the door in 2 minutes, gotta go to work. 
[13:45:54] <D4mned> oh alright 
[13:45:59] <D4mned> well thanks anyway

[21:46:02] <blackop> LuisM18: yea i feel that..
[21:46:47] <blackop> are you all agree "auto market" is wrong definition?
[21:47:04] <blackop> it is not physical store. it defines whole auto market in economy right?
[21:47:15] <blkshp> I have never heard that tr,
[21:47:16] <blkshp> term*
[21:47:20] <LuisM18> not necessarily agreeing to that :P
[21:47:44] <LuisM18> (to it being wrong)
[21:47:48] <blackop> okk then..
[21:47:49] <blkshp> It also depends where you're saying it.
[21:47:50] <blackop> auto store? 
[21:47:53] <blackop> auto showroom?
[21:48:00] <blackop> auto grocery maybe? :p
[21:48:03] <blkshp> Are you saying it in BrE, AmE, AuE?

[21:49:10] <blkshp> !d grocery
[21:49:12] <tinsoldier> grocery — Noun: 1. (usually groceries) retail foodstuffs and other household supplies., 2. A shop or store that sells groceries; a grocery store., — Verb: 1. (intransitive) To go grocery shopping., 2. (transitive) To furnish with groceries. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grocery

[21:49:35] <blkshp> "other household supplies" FINE! :D
[21:49:47] <blackop> well are you all agree with "auto showroom" ?
[21:49:59] <blackop> "lets visit auto showroom to check car prices" ?
[21:50:03] <blkshp> I'd say "car showroom" but I guess.
[21:50:09] <blackop> showrooms* actually
[21:50:10] <blackop> plural

[23:37:37] <blackop> i didnt mean SUV = 4x4
[23:37:45] <twb> "SUV" exists because it allows unsafe vehicles to be sold without breaking US laws.
[23:37:46] <blackop> SUV  and 4x4 are 2 different types

[23:38:56] <blackop> i am trying to translate something
[23:39:16] <twb> I don't know about en-US.
[23:39:29] <twb> I know they use "truck" to refer to both utes and lorries.
[23:39:35] <blackop> is passenger car definition something?
[23:39:38] <blackop> in literature?
[23:39:52] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[23:40:03] <twb> I would expect "passenger vehicle" to mean something primarily used to transport humans, rather than cargo.
[23:40:22] <blackop> exactly
[23:40:46] <blackop> a SUV or an SUV?
[23:41:00] <twb> "an SUV" because I spell out the acronym
[23:41:04] <blackop> ok
[23:41:14] <blackop> a used second hand car or an used second hand car?
[23:41:18] <twb> whereas "a URL" or "an URL" can go either way, depending if you say "you arr ell" or "earl"
[23:41:30] <blackop> i see
[23:41:33] *** Parts: fraggle (~fraggle@user/fraggle) (Leaving)
[23:41:42] <twb> "a used" beause you pronounce "used" with a [j] at the front
[23:42:11] <twb> As a clearer example, newsreaders used to say "an historic occasion" because in their RP accent, they did not say the 'h'
[23:43:07] <blackop> thanks
[23:43:09] <twb> I would also say "second-hand" to avoid misreading
[23:43:10] <blackop> one more thing
[23:43:15] <twb> because "hand" could be a noun
[23:43:19] <blackop> how do you call speed meters on roads?
[23:43:21] <blackop> radar?
[23:43:38] <twb> The thing that measures your own speed is called a "speedo" or "speedometer"
[23:43:44] <blackop> nope
[23:43:51] <blackop> the one government measures
[23:43:51] <twb> The thing police use I think is called a "radar gun" ?
[23:43:55] <blackop> or traffic polices
[23:44:09] <blackop> not gun actually
[23:44:17] <twb> It's called that because it is handheld
[23:44:18] <blackop> there are some stable radar devices to measure
[23:44:22] <blackop> without a human police
[23:44:29] <twb> The ones that are permanently mounted... I'm not sure
[23:44:38] <twb> They might still be called "radar gun"
[23:44:40] <blackop> yes i mean that mounted one
[23:44:47] <blackop> radar might be ok i guess
[23:44:56] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_gun
[23:44:59] <blackop> thanks a lot
[23:47:09] <twb> Oh
[23:47:17] <twb> There are also "speed cameras"
[23:47:38] <twb> These are a radar gun that are connected to an optical camera
[23:47:52] <twb> This is similar to "red light camera"
[23:48:25] <twb> In both cases it takes a photograph anytime someone does the bad thing, and then (nowadays) it's uploaded wirelessly to an OCR reader that finds the numberplate and fines the owner
