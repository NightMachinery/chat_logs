[18:10:29] <writir> Hi, I'm doing my bachelors dissertation on automatic fact verification on political text, specifically detecting internal inconsistencies as this seems more feasible than operating on and comparing with an external "true" knowledge base. It looks like the most straightforward method is by operating on knowledge bases. I am currently playing around with stanford openie, specifically the python wrapper, though 
[18:10:35] <writir> I am uncertain if the output is precise enough to then find meaningful contradications within. Should I be using open information extraction and then devising a method to filter the results, or would some traditional information extraction system (http://turing.cs.washington.edu/papers/acl08.pdf) likely be the better route and extract only a certain subset of relations? Does anyone have any good literature 
[18:10:41] <writir> recs, textbook chapters, on knowledge bases in general?

[19:16:18] <amazigh> How do you define "internal inconsistencies"?
[19:17:03] <amazigh> is that stylographie or something like that ?
[19:17:08] <amazigh> s/ie/y/
[19:17:44] <amazigh> Extracting triples and checking over an knowledge base seems more doable.
[19:18:11] <amazigh> writir: ^?

[19:38:45] <writir> amazigh: internal inconsistencies as in 1. build knowledge base from the political text 2. look at each new triple within the political text and check it on the constructed knowledge base. If does not match the KB, then mark it inconsistent, else add it to the knowledge base.
[19:39:03] <writir> Using an external knowledge base (eg dbpedia) is something I have considered, but this seems like it would double the size of my project and the relations I extract from the political text might not be checkable using external KB's anyway.
[19:39:35] <amazigh> imo forget about dbpedia, except if you know someone that already use it, and has the required hardware.
[19:40:01] <amazigh> You can build your own "oracle" knowledge base like a journalist would do
[19:40:42] <amazigh> that approach looks good, in any case it is a requirement for the "extarnal fact-checking"
[19:41:12] *** Joins: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech)
[19:42:02] <amazigh> Let's say there step 1) external inconsitencies and step 2) external inconsistencies
[19:42:08] <amazigh> sorry!
[19:42:15] <amazigh> Let's say there step 1) internal inconsitencies and step 2) external inconsistencies
[19:43:02] <amazigh> step 1 requires a large amount fo political debates, hence it will be better to try to detect inconsistencies across people, not in a single discourse. I assume it is rare to be inconsistent in a written speech.
[19:44:02] <amazigh> I am not familar with openie in particular; the rumor says IE is a PhD level work 
[19:44:06] * amazigh shrugs
[19:44:57] <amazigh> with that said, I think your into something!

[19:47:55] <amazigh> Checking inconsitencies in a single discourse can serve a test bed, for larger work, hence it more likely a good step forward
[19:48:09] <amazigh> My head yells "unit test".

[19:49:34] <amazigh> which is not easy to come by. An alternative approach would be to rely on indirect sources.
[19:51:22] <writir> Oh yes, I will be doing testing on selected speech to ensure the system functions as expected. We have had testing drilled into us pretty hard.
[19:52:06] <writir> Yeah I think I will focus on internal inconsistencies then
[19:52:35] *** Quits: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech) (Client Quit)
[19:53:34] <writir> Directly stated inconsistencies within a discourse is fairly uncommon so the KB will have to stretch over days and weeks
