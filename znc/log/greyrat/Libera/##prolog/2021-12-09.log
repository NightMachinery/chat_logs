[09:45:53] <pi0> hmm i think i am suppose to see how to write it properly 
[09:46:56] <cehteh> what do you try to archive?
[09:50:16] <pi0> trying to understand if the statement was written properly its an exercise
[09:50:55] <cehteh> properly for what? what kind of rule shall it express?
[09:51:37] <cehteh> a :- b, c.    --> a holds when b and c holds
[09:51:42] <pi0> i understand what you mean, we do not have the actual rule
[09:51:46] <pi0> we have the other side of it
[09:51:52] <pi0> and based on that line of code
[09:51:57] <pi0> is it properly formated 
[09:52:44] <cehteh> a :- b, c, ( d :- e, f).   << would be syntactically correct, but makes no much sense on its own
[09:56:05] <pi0> i understand what you mean
[09:56:14] <pi0> happy(X):- a , b. does appears to be writting properly right
[09:56:42] <pi0> i have my rule, variable plus a, b
[09:57:34] <cehteh> happy(X):- a , b.     << will give you a singleton variable 'X' warning
[09:58:05] <cehteh> so X can be anything and isnt used
[09:58:58] <pi0> oh so it should only have 1 variable a or b?
[09:59:02] <pi0> not both?
[10:00:53] <cehteh> happy(X):- smiles(X), healty(X).        
[10:01:06] <cehteh> translates X is happy when it smiles and is healty
[10:09:02] <pi0> oh i see that is how you would properly call the rule?
[10:09:15] <pi0> by those 2 other rules
[10:11:34] <cehteh> happy(X):- a , b.     is X is happy if a (is true) and b (is true) ... may make sense in some ways, but a and b have no relation to X 
[10:11:54] <cehteh> happy(X):- everyone_is_happy.
[10:12:01] <pi0> oh!
[10:12:06] <pi0> so it is written properly 
[10:12:29] <cehteh> syntactically correct doesnt say anything about sense right
[10:12:57] <cehteh> you can do such, but since it seems you are a beginner i suspect its more surprising to you
[10:13:20] <pi0> i am  :/
[10:13:24] <pi0> happy(X):- hasmoney(X) & has_friends(X).
[10:13:36] <pi0> now this i know is wrong only because of the & operator
[10:13:47] <cehteh> kindof    just  ,  is & in prolog
[10:14:17] <pi0> oh so , and & are interchangeable?

[10:14:47] <cehteh> would be correct
[10:15:15] <pi0> ah i see 
[10:15:44] <cehteh> and alternatives (or) are usually written in separate clauses
[10:15:51] <cehteh> happy(X):- hasmoney(X).
[10:15:57] <cehteh> happy(X):- has_friends(X).
[10:16:25] <cehteh> means  X is happy when X has money OR X has friends
[10:17:01] <cehteh> (and X is double happy, because 2 solutions exist) when X has money AND X has friends

[10:45:31] <cehteh> welll you can road(town1,town2). road(town2,town3). ... on a single line :D
[10:45:57] <cehteh> but still you have to define each road with start and end point as single clause
[10:47:04] <cehteh> one could simplify the data entry with  roads_start_in_town_to_destination(town1, [town2, town3]).    
[10:47:15] <cehteh> using lists
[10:47:31] <cehteh> or define one way and two way roads
[10:48:16] <cehteh> for rather complex settings this makes the data you type in simpler and easier maintainable, but needs more complex logic for querying
[10:48:56] <cehteh> and sooner or later you'll hit endless recursions/loops and other inplausible things
[10:49:32] <cehteh> avoiding that may significantly add complexity
[10:49:56] <cehteh> when there are more roads, finding the shortest route etc
[10:51:10] <pi0> ah 
[10:59:30] <pi0> cehteh: this is a little tricky https://dpaste.org/GvUD
[11:00:31] <cehteh> yes that one needs a bit more prolog knowleges .. esp about list handling and recursion
[11:00:42] <cehteh> but its a common beginner excercise
[11:01:05] <cehteh> usually 'member' is a buildin anyway :D
