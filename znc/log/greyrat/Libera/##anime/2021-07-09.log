[00:59:38] <Berlin36> oh cool
[01:00:02] <Berlin36> how to send emails through tor?
[01:00:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For personal email encrypting the actual content can be useful, but I tend to mainly use VoIP once in a while for acquaintances I care to keep up to date with.
[01:01:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Berlin36: Setup msmtp with your account credentials, set up its proxy port for the Tor SOCKS proxy and run Tor while you're sending stuff through it.
[01:01:44] <Berlin36> ok
[01:01:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Obviously privacy being maintained depends on having registered to the email provider over Tor and never having accessed them without Tor.
[01:02:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That has gotten annoyingly hard as of late
[01:02:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Most of them do stupid things like asking for a phone number when registering

[01:05:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They do if you try to signup with an anonymizer.
[01:05:47] <Berlin36> oh
[01:05:57] <hassoon> Aurora_v_kosmose: nah not really, environment around is poorly regulated/hygienic
[01:06:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hassoon: Heh. I was just messing around.
[01:07:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Both proton and tutanota also don't offer direct imap/pop/smtp access which isn't great. pop allows for keeping minimal info on the server. smtp is required to be able to encrypt emails without terrible user-experience.

[03:09:37] <S_T_A_N> Macer, again the federation does not deal in currency. Though other cultures still do
[03:09:49] <Nanobot> Sxem: Bitcoin's production costs (which is mostly energy cost) is basically: cost = (blockReward + transactionFees) * bitcoinPrice - profitMargin. The blockReward gets cut in half about every four years, eventually approaching zero. The transactionFees are expected to drop as the LN gains traction. The profitMargin approaches zero the more competition exists.
[03:10:04] <Macer> S_T_A_N: you are not understanding
[03:11:23] <Nanobot> Sxem: Regarding mining... Did you hear the news that China kicked out all the Bitcoin miners? The mining hashpower dropped quite substantially recently (and the mining difficulty has already adjusted accordingly)
[03:11:40] <Sxem> the Bitcoin's energy costs graph showed it just going up and up. but if it goes down eventually, that is good
[03:11:57] <Sxem> i hadnt heard
[03:12:12] <Sxem> so maybe bitcoin is now burning half as much coal

[03:14:40] <Nanobot> Sxem: The reason Bitcoin's energy costs have been going up is because the price of Bitcoin has been going up by more than double every 4 years. That isn't going to happen forever.
[03:15:19] <Nanobot> There's nothing in the technology that requires any particular energy cost. It's purely driven by market forces.

[03:17:13] <Nanobot> That's impossible. Ultimately the amount of *energy waste* will normalize to what it is in Bitcoin.
[03:17:15] <S_T_A_N> Okay but any energy at all spent on it is a loss of the world. It serves no purpose except as a means to extract wealth out of gullible fools

[03:25:13] <S_T_A_N> Sumida, notice how they are not even trying to refute that
[03:26:55] <Nanobot> S_T_A_N: Bitcoin is a secure decentralized system for transferring digital assets that can't be copied. That never existed before Bitcoin, and to this day nobody has found any substantially different way of doing it (unless you count PoW vs. PoS). Basically, it's the only way anybody has been able to figure out how to do actual digital currency that isn't subject to the whims of a single authority. That has fundamental value. The fact that you can also 
[03:26:55] <Nanobot> build other technology on top of it is just further value that traditional currencies can't do.
[03:29:09] <S_T_A_N> Nanobot, I am not argueing about blockchain. I am arguing specifically about bitcoin. 
[03:29:22] <Nanobot> Bitcoin won't be useful as a day-to-day currency for most people until the price stabilizes, and that likely won't happen until the price is much much higher than it is today. The price is volatile because it's been rising so quickly. As the block reward halving becomes less and less significant and the price reaches a point where a single rich person can't shock the market with a single transaction, we should see a more gradual incline in the price.
[03:29:31] <S_T_A_N> Blockchin can be used for stuff that matters. Bitcoin is not that though
[03:29:35] <S_T_A_N> Bitcoin is a waste
[03:30:10] <Nanobot> ...How is Bitcoin any more of a waste than any other cryptocurrency?
[03:30:14] <Toadisattva> random somewhat related question, with proof of stake is the validation algorithm far easier than proof of work? I understand stake determines who gets access to do the verification, but it's totes as being significantly less energy intensive, so does that translate to easier algorithms?

[03:31:37] <Sumida> they are all artificially generated scarcity - all made to extract wealth out of gullible fools
[03:31:44] <Jigsy> Someone should hang for this.
[03:32:28] <Nanobot> I'm talking about Bitcoin because it's the biggest and most likely to succeed in the long term, in my opinion. I haven't seen any compelling argument for any other cryptocurrency. Bitcoin keeps evolving and seems to be able to handle anything the other cryptocurrencies are doing.
[03:32:29] <Jigsy> I know they said something about doing some kind of maintainance on the 10th of every month.
[03:32:38] <Jigsy> But today is the 8th!
[03:32:49] <Jigsy> Oh, wait, it's the 9th now.
[03:34:32] <Nanobot> Toadisattva: PoW vs. PoS is a big debate topic. PoS basically asserts that those with more currency are more trustworthy and should have more control over the currency. It costs less energy, yes, but I wouldn't say it really competes with PoW in terms of security and decentralization, which is kind of the whole point of Bitcoin.
[03:35:14] <S_T_A_N> Nanobot, Okay. But none of that makes an argument for why Bitcoin isn't a waste. You speak of it's potential to be a useful digital currency if that was the point that's what it would be. It's not that. You say it will become that but why does that make it worth wasting on until it becomes stable? No one actually wants it stable. They want to keep pump&dumping it in cycles to extract actual wealth from fools they can convince to throw money in.
[03:35:47] <S_T_A_N> Bitcoin is not good for the world now, and it never will be,. 
[03:36:09] <Nanobot> You could say the same about money in general.
[03:36:41] <Sumida> I would say the same about (nearly all) trading of stocks

[03:48:33] <Nanobot> To be clear, PoW in Bitcoin isn't "solving complex math problems" like how a lot of stupid articles describe it. It's just a simple guess-and-check problem. "Find a value that, when added to your block header, hashes to something beginning with at least x number of 0 bits." That's it. So, what they're doing is trying out different numbers until one of them works. The whole idea is that it takes an adjustable amount of effort to solve, is a fair problem 
[03:48:33] <Nanobot> (if you have an equal amount of resources, you have an equal chance of solving it), and takes close to zero effort for anyone to verify a solution once one is found.
[03:57:42] <Toadisattva> so proof of stake uses the same process but which pool of computing power gets a chance to solve it is based on how much they have staked? how does this set up prevent all the chances from going to the single biggest (or few biggest) staker(s)?

[04:07:49] <Nanobot> Toadisattva: No, PoS doesn't use the same process. There are different ways PoS can be done, but basically participants can put up some amount of cryptocurrency as stake, which serves as something like a lottery ticket. If you're chosen, you get to publish the next block, wherein you get to claim some new additional coins. If you aren't chosen, you still have to verify that the chosen block is valid. If you fail or your block is rejected by the others, 
[04:07:49] <Nanobot> then you lose the coins that you put up as stake. Keep in mind that the technology has no way to tell one person from another, so one person could put up 51% of the stake and do whatever they want.

[04:09:25] <Roey> toady sativa: o/
[04:10:29] <Nanobot> sscout: You could try creating a cryptocurrency that works that way, but it won't be a decentralized crypto currency. And in that case, there isn't much point in doing all the PoW stuff in the first place.

[04:16:41] <Toadisattva> okay so my understanding is pow is based on sha-256 hashing, what protocol is pos based on?

[04:17:28] <Toadisattva> I know chia has proof of storage now
[04:17:38] <Nanobot> PoW can be based on any hashing algorithm. PoS also uses hashing algorithm. Hashes are used all over the place, and there isn't any particularly important difference between SHA-256 or any other secure hashing algorithm.
[04:18:05] <Toadisattva> I'm just curious mechanically why pos uses less electricity?
[04:19:04] <Toadisattva> I guess because it's less machines competing for the same blocks?

[04:23:27] <ImoutoBot> [title] Proof–of–Stake (PoS) – BitcoinWiki
[04:25:21] <Nanobot> Toadisattva: No, the reason is because PoS doesn't involve guess-and-check problems. With PoW, miners are just trying out different inputs until they get an output in the correct range. That's where the energy cost happens. The "correct range" automatically adjusts based on how quickly the problem is getting solved on average, so that it will take about 10 minutes on average (this pace allows for network stabilization between blocks). At this point, the 
[04:25:21] <Nanobot> difficulty is high enough that the miners are doing an average of 92 exahashes/second overall, to solve the problem once every 10 minutes on average.
[04:27:16] *** Quits: saxle_ (~saxle@91.90.120.176) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:28:00] <Toadisattva> then what method is pos using?
[04:28:22] <Nanobot> If miners were to stop trying so hard, the difficulty would adjust downward. For example, if I'm the only person mining Bitcoin, and the difficulty is 0, I could do one hash every 10 minutes and always solve it in my first attempt (because any value is acceptable). The difficulty would stay where it is, because I'm keeping the 10 minute pace exactly. But, as soon as someone else wants to compete with me, they're going to do hashes more quickly than that, 
[04:28:22] <Nanobot> which means the problem will get solved more quickly and the difficulty would adjust upward.
[04:28:24] <Toadisattva> I'm reading that wiki link but it's going over my head
[04:28:52] <Toadisattva> I understand the difficulty adjustment in a proof of work network
[04:29:58] <Nanobot> PoS cryptocurrencies don't all work the same way as each other. But, there's basically some deterministic way to roll a random number based on the state of the blockchain, to select one of a preexisting pool of participants to produce the next block.

[04:31:00] <Nanobot> But it does mean that those with the cryptocurrency get rewarded more cryptocurrency and more control over the network.
[04:31:25] <Toadisattva> right and that seems like a recipe for centralization
[04:31:54] <Toadisattva> I was reading they at least have a limit on age of coin and randomize how it's distributed to prevent every opportunity going only to the largest staker
[04:32:05] <Poeticode> damn, thx Nanobot, now I can better explain PoW and PoS to my normie friends
[04:32:11] <Toadisattva> still seems less secure than pow
[04:32:46] <Toadisattva> okay I think I get the gist of it, thanks for answering my dumb questions lol
[04:33:23] <Nanobot> I don't know where your 5 comes from. Basically, if I say, "I'm putting forward a stake of 200 lolicoins" and everyone else puts forward a total of 1800 lolicoins, that means I have a 10% chance of being selected. The selection is done in a deterministic way that anyone in the public can verify.
[04:34:12] <Roey> /nick TheOrgasmColor
[04:34:38] <Nanobot> But, again, there are lots of different ways to accomplish this and try to mitigate the risks, etc.
[04:35:01] <Nanobot> I don't pay close attention to all the different altcoins out there.
[04:39:42] *** Joins: Saxle (~saxle@91.90.120.176)
[04:40:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you don't care about the distributed aspect, GNU Taler has better privacy guarantees and energy efficiency. At the cost of being centralized.
[04:41:07] <Nanobot> Centralized digital currency is easy. Decentralized digital currency was believed to not only be impossible, but was believed to be *proven* impossible, before Bitcoin came around.
[04:41:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That just seems like presumptuous people who deemed it impossible.
[04:41:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I don't recall any formal proof that adversary-resistant consensus networks were impossible.
[04:42:36] <Nanobot> Well, it's still believed to be impossible in terms of cryptographic guards. What makes Bitcoin work is that it incorporates economic incentives to drive up the economic cost of attacks.
[04:42:57] <Nanobot> Specifically, the energy cost is what makes Bitcoin work.
[04:43:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or less prettily said, its computational inefficiency is what makes it resilient.
[04:43:18] <Toadisattva> from that wiki
[04:43:19] <Toadisattva> Work submission is hashed 10 times consecutively. Each consecutive hash maps to an individual unspent output in the blockchain. This is essentially a lottery drawing two sets of five winners. The first five hashes map to mandatory signatures, the final five hashses map to voluntary signatures.
[04:43:52] <Nanobot> Toadisattva: That sounds like one specific PoS implementation.
[04:44:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The lightning network has this unpleasant constant end-to-end connectivity aspect to it.
[04:44:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's pretty hard to maintain privacy in quasi-instantaenous networks.
[04:45:30] <Toadisattva> it does which I though was odd, but that's direct from the bitcoinwik under the mining process heading
[04:46:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Store & forward/DTN mixnets are the way to go.
[04:46:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As far as privacy goes.
[04:46:48] <Toadisattva> are there other coins that have successfully operated on proof of stake for a good bit of time?
[04:47:02] <Toadisattva> or is eth 2.0 gonna be the first kind of large scale live test of pos?
[04:48:52] <Nanobot> Toadisattva: That wiki page also says "It is most commonly used as a supplement to proof-of-work in Peercoin and a few other electronic currencies." which is a weird thing to say. It isn't "a few other electronic currencies", it's a freaking ton of altcoins.
[04:49:15] <Toadisattva> maybe is out of date
[04:49:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh right, given progressively worsening lawmaking from basically every large country or union, I recommend you folks freshen up on DTN protocols like UUCP & NNTP, as well as free-space optical coms.
[04:49:33] <Toadisattva> someone linked it above so I just started reading trying to see if I could figure out how it works
[04:49:52] <Nanobot> Looks like the page hasn't really been updated since 2018.
[04:49:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> We're heading for some bad times.
[04:52:11] <Nanobot> I remember some video where Andreas Antonopoulos argued that Bitcoin supports PoS. :P
[04:52:33] <Nanobot> But I think he was talking about something that's possible on the LN layer.
[04:53:43] <Nanobot> Toadisattva: I don't know the quality of this list, but it came up when I Googled: https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/proof-of-stake/

[09:00:35] <Nanobot> Fixing "!g" required changing how it scrapes one thing. Fixing "!c" requires changing how it scrapes a dozen or so different things.

[14:04:39] <Sumida> it probably won't take five years if you learn it in japan, but the learning never stops
[14:04:44] <Berlin36> I'm not
[14:05:00] <Berlin36> yeah, the learning never stops
[14:05:31] <Berlin36> I'm not even an adult
[14:07:37] <Sumida> no adult videos for you
[14:07:48] <Berlin36> o k
[14:08:13] <Berlin36> i hate that i can not read and listen to music at one time
[14:08:30] <Berlin36> i wanna learn something but i also love having music in the background
[14:08:35] <Berlin36> but it distracts me =D
[14:08:46] <Berlin36> sad face*  :C
[14:09:01] <Berlin36> i speak about books and stuff..
[14:09:14] <amigojapan> Right
[14:11:41] <Sumida> music in the background can work for some people but not if you want to actually focus on the music
[14:11:46] <MootPoot> Berlin36:  thats doable though
[14:12:00] <MootPoot> but yeah not if you want to focus on the music
[14:12:07] <Berlin36> yes
[14:12:10] <MootPoot> and also the music has to be insstrumental only
[14:12:24] <Berlin36> maybe classic 
[14:12:25] <MootPoot> we only have 1 language center of the brain not 2
[14:12:26] <Berlin36> yeah
[14:13:28] <amigojapan> Tomako can listen to music and study at the same time. Sometimes she listens to two songs at once and it drives me crazy

[14:16:22] <MootPoot> actually paying attention to 2 sonds and study at the same time
[14:16:25] <MootPoot> its not humanly possible
[14:16:46] <amigojapan> MootPoot: women are good at multitasking
[14:16:58] <Berlin36> well two songs is already not so usual
[14:17:04] <MootPoot> no such thing as multitasking in humans when it comes to advanced non-muscle memory tasks amigo
[14:17:14] <MootPoot> thats like saying humans have 3 brains
[14:17:27] <Berlin36> yeah but why listen to two songs
[14:17:36] <MootPoot> "multitasking" in humans is single threaded async computer at BEST
[14:17:42] <Berlin36> it doesn't sound too good, does it 
[14:17:42] <MootPoot> compute*
[14:17:55] <amigojapan> Dunno Berlin36 I have asked her to stop that many times
[14:18:13] <Berlin36> i mean there are a lot of reasons why this doesn't sound too good
[14:18:31] <Berlin36> welp if she likes it then why not, i guess
[14:19:05] <amigojapan> Yup Berlin36 
[14:19:12] <Sumida> singing two songs at the same time, that would be impressive
[14:19:31] <Berlin36> welp
[14:19:42] <MootPoot> Sumida:  thats possible but only by cheating
[14:19:43] <Berlin36> sing something on the instrument, and something else with your voice
[14:20:01] <MootPoot> the trick is to memorize your two seperate songs as one
[14:20:06] <MootPoot> so you're actually just doing one
[14:20:08] <MootPoot> from your brains POV
[14:20:31] <Sumida> yes, cheating is cheating
[14:20:50] <lastonestanding> Intial D Has Changed My Life :)
[14:20:56] <MootPoot> its two songs from the viewers perspective but from the players perspectice its just one
[14:21:27] <Berlin36> i don't think it works really that easy
[14:21:35] <MootPoot> it isent
[14:21:36] <Berlin36> but it is possible for sure
[14:21:55] <MootPoot> if you told the same person to play that one song and another one rather then the pair they originally memorized
[14:21:59] <MootPoot> they would not be able to do it
[14:22:14] <Berlin36> a good example is Fantasie Improptu by Chopin

[15:53:04] <amigojapan> Yes you would not know the budget by watching it
[15:53:14] <Berlin36> here, nobody cares
[15:53:22] <death916> if you  know the budget b4 watchig it u can kinda see it
[15:53:26] <death916> but if you didnt alrdy know you wouldnt
[15:53:28] <Berlin36> xD
[15:53:29] <amigojapan> Berlin36: you can but you will get 10 years in prison
[15:53:31] <death916> youd just hink it was shot that way
[15:53:36] <Berlin36> loolllll 
[15:53:40] <Berlin36> rough

[15:54:51] <amigojapan> death916: VPN can't help cause they track the ammout you upload to your ISP, but yeah seedbox may help
[15:55:31] <Berlin36> didn't know it's so serious
[15:55:33] <death916> how do u get movies? do u justa lways pay
[15:55:39] <death916> just always
[15:55:47] <death916> or stream sites
[15:55:49] <amigojapan> death916: they suspect you after 30gb uploads
[15:55:56] <death916> that sux
[15:56:03] <Berlin36> yeah
[15:56:04] <death916> what if u run a home server
[15:56:08] <death916> and upload ur pics to it
[15:56:13] <death916> or from it
[15:56:14] <death916> idk
[15:56:15] <death916> lol
[15:56:27] <amigojapan> death916: you can still stream. Somehow they don't consider that "downloads
[15:56:45] <death916> because the people that make laws arent technical people
[15:57:01] <death916> they are old
[15:57:03] <death916> and out of touch
[15:57:19] <amigojapan> death916: of it is over 30gb they will call you and ask you if you are downloading copyrighted materials
[15:57:52] <Berlin36> "you pirating?"
[15:57:52] <Berlin36> "no sir"
[15:57:52] <Berlin36> "good."
[15:57:59] <death916> lol
[15:58:11] <amigojapan> Berlin36: they will ask what you are doing
[15:58:16] <Berlin36> or
[15:58:24] <Berlin36> hack a wifi and download from it
[15:58:31] <death916> now ur just adding crimes
[15:58:36] <death916> doesnt seem like the solution
[15:58:36] <Berlin36> welp
[15:58:40] <amigojapan> Berlin36: and if it goes on too long you may get raided
[15:58:48] <Berlin36> wow

[19:23:09] <PancakeMatsuri> with bloody hooks
[19:23:12] <KatrinValerie> No
[19:23:21] <KatrinValerie> I will make a lisp machine in javascript
[19:23:40] <PancakeMatsuri> you can, but they pay for React

[22:38:01] <Matt|home> MysticPimp : futa is specifically hermaphroditism, typically without testicles. "dickgirl" is fairly generic and can refer to futa, crossdressing or trans as well. there's a specific word in japanese for trans but i don't know it off the top of my head, but these are generally reserved for porn
[22:38:17] <Matt|home> MysticPimp : and shota is little boy porn. the opposite of loli.

[23:07:46] <Matt|home> alright so part of the store has to do with art and expression - essentially there's an in-universe legitimate reason why they all dress like anime characters, and it's fairly complex actually. but each character has their own unique clothing sets and they're all fairly elaborate
