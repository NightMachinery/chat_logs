[06:22:24] <selwyn> why\
[06:22:37] <gilberth> This is ironic, since by default regex(3) of libc does match '^' and '$' at the beginning and end of input only, not at begin and end of line. You need to pass REG_NEWLINE to regcomp(3) to make '$' match the end of line too.
[06:25:27] <hayley> Because I am struggling to figure out how it matches up with Cheney's copying algorithm. There's "scavenge" and "transport" functions, those are indirect through a lookup table that Lisp code generates, and sometimes scavenging sets a forwarding pointer, sometimes transport does, so idk what does what.
[06:29:38] <selwyn> must be difficult
[06:29:58] <gilberth> So I will do that too. It's different in lexers though, where matching at begin and end of input only, would be odd. And a lexer matches every character in the input anyway.
[06:30:46] <gilberth> But it's unfortunate that the meaning of '.', '^', and '$' depends on an interpretation set up elsewhere.
[06:30:47] <selwyn> trying out the mcclim demos
[06:31:43] <hayley> So, scavenging reads the slots out of an object which is already in to-space, and transporting does the copy. Okay.

[08:50:27] <pl> shouldn't simple string also work for that?
[08:50:40] <gilberth> Isn't base-char a subtype of character? But then those array types are somewhat strange.
[08:50:48] <hayley> SIMPLE-STRING is also a supertype of SIMPLE-BASE-STRING or something.
[08:50:54] <gilberth> pl: No, SBCL has this silly 8-bit chars, too.
[08:51:09] <hayley> So you get dispatch on every AREF, which I learnt the hard way (after scymtym reminded me).
[08:51:43] <gilberth> Which is funny, as I always declare as (simple-array character (*)), so I have not noticed.
[08:52:53] <gilberth> But it's better these days, with CLtL1 it was a challenge to figure out the right element type for MAKE-ARRAY to construct a string.

[09:20:21] <hayley> Vega 1 had 24 cores/chip, all with shared memory.
[09:22:12] <hayley> But then 24 cores/chip * 16 chips = 384 cores, which is pretty far off.
[09:22:18] <dave0> is it really 864 times faster?
[09:23:11] <hayley> No, each core is slower. Apparently about 1/4 the speed of a typical x86 core.
[09:27:18] <dave0> i'm reminded of a futurama quote
[09:27:52] <dave0> one $300 dollar hookerbot, or three-hundred $1 dollar hookerbots
[09:29:26] <gilberth> Well, this was the idea of the Connection Machine, with 64k 4-bit processors.
[09:31:20] <gilberth> Or where they 1-bit even? Long ago that I read the book.
[09:32:16] <hayley> 1-bit I think.
[09:32:57] <gilberth> Then perhaps 4-bit was an idea never realized. Or I have just imagined it. /me shrugs

[09:35:13] <White_Flame> yeah, connection machines had a roadmap for further work
[09:35:23] <White_Flame> >1 bit stuff was certainly on there
[09:36:08] <White_Flame> also, AMD is going to probably hit 256 cores per chip in just a few years
[09:36:18] <White_Flame> (per socket, whatever)
[09:36:35] <White_Flame> not too far to get 864 full-speed cores soon
[09:36:48] <hayley> :O
[09:37:14] <moon-child> just get an 8 socket cpu 4head
[09:38:30] <hayley> I can't afford a 16 core 1 socket CPU though.

[13:17:23] <pl> selwyn: wasn't it UK again misusing it, just like with contract tracing?
[13:17:40] <selwyn> well, this one is claimed to be a 'clerical error'
[13:17:54] <selwyn> i am not really sure if i believe it
[13:18:30] <selwyn> could be a case of blaming a non-specific tech error to cover up more serious negligence
[13:18:58] <hayley> What if you wanted to optimize the GC but SBCL said no
[13:19:10] <pl> selwyn: consider that a big problem with brexit was how UK ports are often simply unprepared for modern trading, and used manually filled excel sheets for things like container ship data
[13:19:38] <pl> selwyn: meanwhile probably even north korean ports supported UN EDIFACT data files
[13:19:43] <selwyn> can believe that
[13:20:06] <selwyn> honestly, i don't understand how we have a tech industry sometimes
[13:20:17] <pl> (pre-brexit, considerable volume of cargo went to rotterdam, got reloaded on car, then went on roro-ship to UK)
[13:21:14] <selwyn> i read once that germany uses rotterdam a lot simply because it is the best port around, and their own ports get neglected
[13:21:46] <pl> it's well connected with other places in germany, but they also have a giant port in hamburg
[13:22:15] <pl> it's simply that there's probably enough manufacturing in germany to require more capacity
[13:22:24] <selwyn> they had a plan to establish 'freeports' after brexit but afaict it was quietly dropped
[13:22:51] <ck_> What about that small platform off the east coast (?), what was it called again
[13:22:52] <pl> selwyn: WTO is a bitch
[13:22:54] <ck_> "sealand"?

[13:23:58] <hayley> I'm still prefetching tospace rather than the pointer to follow. Fuck.
[13:24:30] <selwyn> there was also a plan to establish hong kong 2 on the coast somewhere
[13:24:43] <selwyn> always hard to see how seriously these plans are taken
[13:25:22] <Gnuxie> lwl
[13:25:24] <ck_> erring to the side of "joke" is probably best
[13:25:34] * hayley hurts head on how many pointers deep she is

[13:27:57] <selwyn> didn't that happen?

[13:29:27] <selwyn> now i remember the latest national tech news
[13:29:44] <selwyn> mi6 and other national intelligence agencies will use amazon for cloud storage/computing

[13:31:45] <selwyn> like what?

[13:38:44] <pl> especially since in last few years amazon added AWS DCs somewhere near london
[13:39:10] <selwyn> i would have guessed that a serious power would not want to use non-national tech full stop
[13:43:18] <kevingal> The US government has its own AWS regions. You have to have a certain level of security clearance to work on it directly.
[13:44:09] <kevingal> And you can only work on it from a Top Secret room.
[13:44:43] <pl> I think most of govcloud doesn't require SCIF, but there are zones that do
[13:45:14] <selwyn> the only serious security practices i have heard of in this country are at hedge funds
[13:45:49] <selwyn> during lockdown they similarly required devs to come in as it was against the rules to access the codebase from outside the safe room
[13:46:03] <selwyn> someone got sent to prison for selling secrets
[13:49:46] <kevingal> My old team-mate asked a govcloud employee where to find the secret room with the gun-bearing security guards.
[13:50:05] <kevingal> The govcloud guy became super shifty and asked him to stop asking about it.
[13:50:17] <pl> lol
[13:50:18] <kevingal> I'm guessing he had a microchip in his brain that would explode if he revealed any information.
[13:50:45] <pl> or probably wanted to avoid a mess of figuring if he was being phished or not
[13:51:28] <pl> because it's better to be shifty on non-secret info at times than having to become double-informant (playing on double-agent) later
[13:51:43] <pl> or so they said in my counterintelligence prep
[13:52:17] <selwyn> you mean having to feed them false information later?
[13:52:23] <pl> selwyn: or controlled
[13:52:36] <pl> generally being under supervision of counterintelligence service
[13:52:45] <selwyn> right
[13:53:05] <selwyn> 'the gun bearing security guards all fire blanks they are no problem'
[13:53:41] <pl> selwyn: funnily enough, pretty sure the equivalent of SCIF on our site was in publicly known place
[13:53:52] <pl> that made it easier for people without clearance to avoid it
[13:54:38] * pl also technically violated clearance rules several times, but he is unsure if supervision from officers with necessary clearance didn't ocver it
[13:54:41] <pl> *cover it
[13:57:58] <pl> coincidentally, Lockheed-Martin sucks, especially its Global Training & Logistics division (now renamed, probably because too many people who knew it raised too high in ranks)

[14:04:59] <selwyn> vaguely recall a story about american intelligence types setting up a 'top secret room' in a civilian british foreign office building in the early iraq war era
[14:05:10] <selwyn> with hilarious results
[14:06:48] <pl> why would it go hilarious? It's not like back in WW2 when they had incompatible classification standards leading to some issues
[14:07:21] <pl> unless some idiot on american side wanted to deal with /NOFORN in it?
[14:07:32] <selwyn> iirc they did not label the room
[14:07:52] <pl> (NOFORN means it can't be shared outside of USA entities)
[14:08:17] <selwyn> so diplomat types would sometimes walk in, not expecting to find intelligence operatives there
[14:08:49] <pl> well, that sounds like total failure in setting up the room
[14:08:54] <pl> if it was supposed to be SCIF
[14:09:08] <pl> because even if it's unlabeled you're not supposed to be able to simply barge in

[21:47:18] <shka> you would be simply an illegal alien iirc
[21:47:19] <pl> shka: the minimum period is 2 years, afaik 
[21:47:28] <pl> From declaration to exit 
[21:47:28] <shka> so there is time
[21:47:34] <selwyn> looking forward to the european dixie timeline
[21:47:41] <selwyn> who else will join the confederacy?
[21:48:05] <shka> how fucking idiotic this is
[21:48:07] <pl> Hungary? 
[21:48:18] <shka> yeah, suer, they actually can
[21:48:44] <shka> Fidesz is such a nest corruption that it puts even PiS to shame
[21:48:51] <pl> Not sure

[21:49:25] <shka> read it up, it is really astonishing
[21:49:51] <shka> i could not believe that they could be worse, but yeah, they absolutely are on another level
[21:50:06] <shka> but they are still more competent...
[21:50:07] <pl> Consider that pretty much every PiS member and their family is on some corrupted position... 
[21:50:33] <shka> yeah, this is true, but it is not different in Hungary
[21:50:53] <shka> AND they defraud EU funds on the massive scale
[21:51:04] <pl> That's in quick estimate 100k ppl 
[21:51:07] <shka> AND they do gerrymandering 
[21:51:11] <pl> And they also defraud a lot

[22:01:28] <shka> selwyn: the year 2030, pissed off Brits and Polish decide to form another country and apply for the EU membership xD
[22:01:40] <shka> what will the national anthem?
[22:02:12] <White_Flame> well, as an american, we do have ties to britain.  After brexit, we can certainly give them assistance and upgrade them to a colony of the USA
[22:02:37] <selwyn> hm
[22:03:22] <selwyn> the dambusters theme song?

[22:10:00] <pl> A mix of Dąbrowski Mazurek And Scotland the Brave 
[22:10:24] <pl> Cause of scot-french alliance 
[22:10:59] <selwyn> its hard to think of any predecessor states taht fit the bill
[22:11:02] <selwyn> hanseatic league?
[22:11:45] <pl> That was more a kind confederation of semi-autonomous cities 
[22:12:03] <selwyn> yeah
[22:12:10] <selwyn> but it sort of has some of britain and some of poland
[22:12:46] <pl> Not Scotland, and I think the English would still be stuck 
[22:12:57] <selwyn> well
[22:13:09] <selwyn> perhaps this idea will not work out that well after all :)
[22:13:46] <shka> if this is nation without a model, it should have an unique anthem as well 
[22:14:33] <shka> i suggest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xgwXkULDCs
[22:14:33] -ixelp- The Clash - Safe European Home (Remastered) [Official Audio] - YouTube
[22:14:49] <selwyn> whenever i try to talk to english remainers about poland and hungary, the response is usually bemusement
[22:15:56] <selwyn> for people who claim to be utterly invested in the idea of europe, they really don't have any idea what europe is like
[22:16:30] <selwyn> they think most of the place has the liberal politics of berlin or rotterdam
[22:16:32] <selwyn> which it doesn't
[22:19:06] * shka thinks that the idea anthem should be Ska Rock
[22:19:40] <shka> seriously though
[22:20:00] <shka> the join referendum passed with 80% or something
[22:20:20] <shka> and currently, it would have passed with like 90%
[22:22:34] <selwyn> can't they choose to just do it unilaterally
[22:22:44] <shka> they can
[22:23:17] <shka> but i would suspect that this would lead to violent protests 
[22:23:19] <shka> like 
[22:23:22] <shka> really violent
[22:23:33] <shka> street wars level of violent

[22:24:16] <shka> mfiano: does not work
[22:24:24] <mfiano> My ERC just crapped out

[22:26:12] <shka> sorry to hear it
[22:27:32] <APic> ;=P
[22:27:54] <shka> anyway
[22:28:22] <shka> selwyn: anglosaxonslavs for the better tomorrow :P
[22:29:21] <selwyn> think i mentioned once i met a polish nationalist here who wanted poland to leave the eu as well
[22:29:29] <selwyn> expect he is having a good time now
[22:29:36] <shka> yeah... those... 'people'
