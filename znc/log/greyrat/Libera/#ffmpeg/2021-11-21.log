[01:18:15] <BtbN> That makes no sense and I'd say if you didn't explicitly add a filter that did that, is impossible even

[01:24:06] <tuxd3v> it has tons of options and usually is end in errors

[01:24:38] <BtbN> I mean, it works, but is very unusual
[01:25:21] <BtbN> I see nothing wrong there with the video. If that gets messed up during playback, that's most likely on your player.

[03:19:30] <BtbN> You're still using vorbis though, and are not specifying an audio bitrate
[03:19:42] <tuxd3v> the trick to eliminate the panel... well just passed 1680x1011 resolution, it will automatically eliminate the lower part ...found it :)
[03:19:54] <BtbN> And the aspect argument is most likely doing nothing, and in the worst case breaking it, because it's not 8:5 anymore
[03:20:17] <tuxd3v> I don't know if its the way of doing it, but I am trying for several days and exhausted..
[03:21:00] <tuxd3v> ho, the aspect ratio, right, its not neded now , thanks
[03:21:03] <tuxd3v> :)
[03:21:34] <tuxd3v> about the vorbis, how can I solve it, and what is best?
[03:21:49] <BtbN> aac with 128k bitrate is plenty
[03:22:00] <BtbN> so just -c:a aac -b:a 128k
[03:22:11] <BtbN> keep in mind it's mono, so 128k is very overkill
[03:22:38] <tuxd3v> 64k?
[03:22:47] <tuxd3v> yeah its mono unfortunatly :(
[03:23:00] <tuxd3v> how does people get stereo, 2 microphones?
[03:23:20] <BtbN> Nothing wrong with mono if it's just voice

[04:26:56] <tuxd3v> :)
[04:27:49] <tuxd3v> one thing that I would love to have to complement the solution I have, is the capability to only add frames to file , if video changes..
[04:28:23] <tuxd3v> if video image is the same , mantain the same image, reducing in a colossal way processing power, and also size of the files
[04:28:29] <tuxd3v> that would be nice
[04:29:46] <tuxd3v> I read in simplescreenrecorder, they have that option, but its graphical app, so I don't know how to activate it via flags in the command..

[08:44:44] <kepstin> yeah, ffmpeg can use vaapi. looks like encoding h264 should work on your card
[08:47:05] <kepstin> https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/VAAPI#Encoding has some example command lines
[08:47:42] <kepstin> note that your graphics don't have a very good hardware encoder; it might be helpful for e.g. live streams if you don't otherwise have enough cpu power to encode, for example.
[08:47:49] *** Joins: waagrr (~waagrr@220.85.70.23)
[08:48:30] <kepstin> but if you're encoding files i'd probably recommend sticking with a software encoder, even tho it might be slower

[15:13:46] <video2go> hi. I think I have a problem with lack of knowledge and not finding the right words to get a result. We do a live production in 108p50 which is OK, but I have trouble of getting this to 1080i50 for TV production. I use Blackmagic Up/Down Cross converter, but I am not satisficed with the result. How could I use ffmpeg to get SRT stream and to convert 1080p50 to 1080i50?

[19:11:39] <tuxd3v> maybe the quality is not exactly the same as with  -crf 18 -preset superfast, but it seems unnoticeable
[19:14:12] <tuxd3v> and when playing the video, is uses less than half of the cpu, comparing to playing a video encoded by libx264

[22:45:35] <JEEB> I didn't look at the code, but your issue yesterday seemed to be that the timestamps were completely different between the buffers' inputs to the overlay
[22:45:39] <tuxd3v> -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset superfast - produces files that are half in size of- -c:v h264_vaapi -qp 18
[22:46:01] <JEEB> N77: the simplest way to fix that is to just make whatever is feeding your application to utilize something as a timestamp base
[22:46:11] *** Joins: Nick_d0gb0y (sid467444@id-467444.lymington.irccloud.com)
[22:46:14] <JEEB> that way it doesn't matter whether you started 10 seconds or 1 second ago
[22:46:16] <tuxd3v> also the bitrate of '-c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset superfast' is half of '-c:v h264_vaapi -qp 18'
[22:47:07] <N77> JEEB: Thanks for the suggestions, I tried that out along with converting between different time_base(s) like you suggested, but the video was still running slow. I wasn't sure of what else to do
[22:49:27] <N77> I can post the code that I modified in one of the functions to convert between the different time_bases(s) that you suggested if you want
[22:50:30] <JEEB> time base synchronization just means your timestamps should be read OK and passed to the filter chain OK. but since the timestamps were so different and you noted that things worked as long as you started inputs close enough - it sounds like your input isn't utilizing the same timestamp offset
[22:50:40] <JEEB> so you have something feeding that application
[22:50:53] *** Joins: Amoz (~alex@h-155-4-73-184.A192.priv.bahnhof.se)
[22:51:05] <JEEB> simplest would be to have something like input timestamp offset being the unix timestamp or something :P
[22:51:29] <JEEB> that way even if you start the inputs at different times, the timestamps should be in similar ranges when you start reading them
[22:54:32] <N77> That was my first thought. When I did that (before I posted questions here), one of the videos (the screen-grab video) was playing back very slow. When I implemented the change of converting from the AVStream time_base to the AVCodecContext time_base (before calling avcodec_send_packet()) then converting from AVCodecContext time_base to
[22:54:33] <N77> AVFilterContext time_base (before calling av_buffersrc_add_frame()), both videos were playing slower than expected.
[22:56:42] <N77> So, the suggestions worked concerning getting the final frame out of the av_buffersink_get_frame() call, but I'm not sure why they're playing back slowly...
[22:57:45] <JEEB> well you can check if your logic seems sound by using av_ts2timestr
[22:57:50] <JEEB> and logging that

[22:58:19] <JEEB> you first get packet from demuxer, and you log av_ts2timestr(pkt->pts, AVStream->time_base)
[22:58:44] <JEEB> then you convert to decoder's time base and do the same before feeding to decoder
[22:58:55] <JEEB> time base being the one you just supposedly converted to
[22:59:28] <JEEB> it will basically give you a string'ified representation of the pts on that time base
[23:00:03] <N77> Gotcha. Thanks I'll try that out, I'll let you know how it goes
[23:00:59] <JEEB> and if your log leve is higher than or equal to AV_LOG_VERBOSE f.ex. the buffersrc filter will log its configuration (including time base as tb)
[23:01:08] <JEEB> so you can attempt to verify such things
[23:01:30] <JEEB> as long as these timestamps are just correctly adjusted according to the time base they're being taken into, everything should be fine
