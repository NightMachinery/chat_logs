[00:17:00] <indigo> TIL enable/disable [a feature] is not inclusive language
[00:19:11] <imode> pardon.
[00:19:43] <Brekkjern> This is the kind of shit that needs to stop...
[00:23:13] <Church> indigo: Context?
[00:23:32] <gwozniak> indigo: was there an altenative proposed?
[00:27:37] <indigo> For work. The alternatives are turn on/turn off
[00:27:46] <Church> Ah
[00:27:52] <Brekkjern> But isn't that sexual language?
[00:28:03] <indigo> Brekkjern: +1 I brought that up
[00:29:28] <imode> who's saying this, exactly.
[00:29:34] <imode> and how hard did they hit their head.
[00:30:05] <indigo> My wife has a disability, and she was also confused about enable/disable not being inclusive
[00:31:10] <imode> I guarantee you it's not someone with a disability, but someone being offended on behalf of someone else. who is not offended.
[00:33:17] <companion_cube> or no one is offended, and it's paranoid people at $company who are afraid
[00:34:16] <indigo> Alternatively, it could be genuinely offensive for some. I'm OK to avoid the language as long as I understand why it shouldn't be used rather than blindly following the rule
[00:34:36] <imode> there is absolutely nothing offensive about that language whatsoever.
[00:34:48] <companion_cube> > blindly following the rule
[00:34:49] <imode> and I refuse to be gaslit into thinking there is by people who don't understand the gravity of the term.
[00:34:52] <companion_cube> how offensive to blind people
[00:35:19] <indigo> companion_cube: touché
[00:35:24] <imode> I'm disabled, my wife is disabled.
[00:35:32] <imode> my mother's disabled, my father's disabled.
[00:35:45] <imode> anybody wants to be offended on our behalf gets a baseball bat to the kneecaps.
[00:35:58] <indigo> If they get a baseball bat to the kneecaps, wouldn't they also become disabled?
[00:36:09] <imode> indeed.
[00:36:19] <imode> see if they feel offended now. :P
[00:36:34] <gwozniak> A friend of mine works closely with AbleGamers and they say "disability"
[00:37:09] <companion_cube> I think people might confuse disabled people with twitter users
[00:37:13] <companion_cube> some of which have diss-abilities
[00:37:32] <gwozniak> So I doubt enable/disable is language that they disagree with
[00:38:46] <indigo> I think it's using enable/disable in the context of something else (like a feature) rather than an actual disability
[00:39:19] <imode> such invented offense.
[00:39:50] <gwozniak> I suspect using 'cripple' might be a different story
[00:40:37] <indigo> Right, or "master/slave" and "sanity check"
[00:41:01] <Brekkjern> I know a dude in a wheelchair that has "Cripple" as vanity plates on his car.
[00:41:08] <imode> I really wanna meet someone who's offended by these terms.
[00:41:11] <Brekkjern> He's fucking hilarious
[00:41:21] <indigo> Also "grandfathered in"

[00:41:47] <imode> why in the world is that offensive. what grandpa is saying "DAMN YOU, YOU CAN'T SAY THAT".
[00:48:48] <jjuran> I suspect that the purpose of policing language is to establish a precedent of being an authority on acceptable behavior.

[00:50:31] <jjuran> We're not big on devoting an entire piece of furniture to timekeeping, but this clock was my grandfather's, so…
[00:50:43] <imode> there's a fair bit of background behind those, yes.
[01:08:14] <dimadima> enable disable
[01:08:41] <dimadima> i think the problem is that words can have multiple definitions and connocations
[01:08:57] <dimadima> connotations
[01:09:10] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:09:31] <Brekkjern> I remember watching a video with "retarded bombs" in the title
[01:09:48] <dimadima> what kind of bombs were these
[01:09:56] <Brekkjern> I spent waaaaaaaay too long wondering about that before I realized it's the technical term for bombs with a parachute on them...
[01:10:03] <dimadima> ah
[01:10:36] <Brekkjern> "I've heard about 'dumb' munitions, but 'retarded'? Isn't that going a bit far?"
[01:17:19] <imode> good stew, good wine, good bread, cold day, good work, good shows, comfortable temperature, life's good.
[01:17:45] <bkero> Cold day?
[01:17:48] <Brekkjern> Nice
[01:18:06] <Brekkjern> I was freezing my balls off while going to the exam today.
[01:18:10] <bkero> It's 15c here in Portland. 13C in Seattle.
[01:18:20] <Brekkjern> Was -11C here this morning :S
[01:18:25] <Brekkjern> Cold AF
[01:18:25] <imode> 12C north of Seattle.
[01:18:42] <bkero> 25c in front of my fireplace :)
[01:18:51] <Brekkjern> I wish I had a fireplace now...
[01:19:13] <jjuran> Linux's DRI subsystem has "dumb buffers", which grates on my nerves a bit.
[01:19:47] <imode> what distinguishes them from "smart buffers"
[01:20:05] <jjuran> Not because it's offensive to to the unintelligent (which I doubt it is), but because it's a poorly chosen term.
[01:20:52] <Brekkjern> The problem with "dumb" is that it is kinda overloaded
[01:20:54] <jjuran> I have the urge to make my point by pretending to forget the name and "mistakenly" call them stupid buffers, idiotic buffers, etc.
[01:21:11] <jjuran> asinine buffers :-)
[01:21:11] <Brekkjern> It's both "stupid" and "mute"
[01:21:27] <imode> why do they call them dumb buffers?
[01:21:30] <jjuran> I think in this case, it just means "simple"
[01:21:41] <imode> that's stupid.
[01:21:42] <Brekkjern> Why not call them "simple" then?!
[01:21:44] <Brekkjern> ARGH
[01:21:52] <imode> is there a contrasting buffer type?
[01:21:57] <imode> otherwise just call them... _buffers_.
[01:21:58] <Brekkjern> QoS
[01:21:59] <dimadima> smart phone dumb phone
[01:22:04] <dimadima> smart _____ ?
[01:22:09] <imode> smart dumb.
[01:22:11] <bkero> I'm thinking buffered pipes vs non-buffered pipes
[01:22:15] <Brekkjern> Prioritized buffers...
[01:22:22] <imode> then call 'em buffered!
[01:22:28] <dimadima> i think i'm just happy
[01:22:32] <bkero> Like mkfifo a; cat a & ; echo hi > a
[01:22:39] <bkero> without 'cat a' that echo would never enter the fifo
[01:24:02] <jjuran> I think "dumb" here means "not GPU-accelerated"
[01:24:27] <bkero> Or dumb == no aws service for it
[01:24:35] <imode> adjectives are contrasting. you call something <adjective> <noun>, you better have something you can call <antonym adjective> <noun>
[01:25:16] <imode> smart begets dumb, buffered begets unbuffered.
[01:25:26] <Brekkjern> Yeah

[02:46:14] <imode> ngoldbaum: yeah fuck that that's exactly why I can't search for it lmao.
[02:46:46] <indigo> imode: I don't see why not? Wine is just a compatibility layer
[02:46:53] <imode> aight.
[02:48:14] <indigo> What are you trying to profile? If it's not Wine-specific issues that are causing your grief, it might be easier to profile the app on Windows
[02:48:54] <imode> it's a game called Metroid Planets, and unfortunately due to the devs being manchildren, they refuse to release the source.
[02:49:29] <imode> it's a simple 2D metroid 1 clone.
[02:49:32] <imode> with a level editor.
[02:49:48] <imode> running on my T430 rockets my load average from 1 to 4 and nearly kills pulseaudio.
[02:50:03] <indigo> Interesting
[02:50:11] <imode> so, naturally, I wonder... _why_.
[02:50:49] <indigo> Good luck! I love performance optimization/benchmarking work :-)
[02:51:13] <imode> GPU load isn't captured in a load average, iirc. there is some bizzare setup where animated palettes for tiles are done with shaders, which.. I don't know why they don't just preprocess them and store them with the room.
[02:51:24] <imode> I need a flame graph. -_-
[02:51:46] <companion_cube> you can't build it, correct?
[02:52:00] <companion_cube> otherwise I'd say to link it with tracy and run it as root, it captures a shitton of stuff
[02:52:13] <imode> I can't build it. I don't have the source, and it was compiled with game maker studio 2.
[02:52:36] <indigo> Wow! Tracy looks awesome
[02:53:14] <companion_cube> tracy is awesome
[02:53:38] <companion_cube> it can import catapult files, too ♥
[02:53:58] <letoram> +1 for tracy.
[02:53:59] <indigo> Also re: wine + games; I've generally had poor luck with running games through it
[02:54:09] <letoram> should be recommended always, fucking awesome engineering behind that one.
[02:54:38] <letoram> it's manual is worth a read on its own
[02:54:59] <imode> indigo: what's bizzare is that other games run.. _fine_.
[02:55:17] <companion_cube> letoram: it dunks on mac OS 😂

[02:57:32] <imode> is there an easy flamegraph generator for perf traces, I saw a script for one.

[03:09:20] <imode> thanks.. this'll have to wait until a meetin'.
[03:11:28] <letoram> companion_cube: trying to build that kind of IPC on OSX is .. painful indeed
[03:12:02] <letoram> their "posix" "compliance" is quite the joke .. it's posix but 'oh not anything that has tied to realtime-posix, that's implementation defin..."

[05:00:25] <imode> why are metroid fans such manchildren.
[05:04:26] <imode> also, wait a minute. colorways are "available for a limited time"?
[05:04:58] <imode> who the hell decided that was a good idea.
[05:22:53] <dimadima> good evening
[05:23:00] <imode> allo dimadima.
[05:23:38] <dimadima> allo imode. someone tell you to fuck off and die?
[05:24:32] <imode> yep!
[05:24:38] <imode> always nice.
[05:25:12] <imode> "arch users are always arguing for stuff to be open source"
[05:25:19] <imode> "fuck off, die, shut up, go away"
[05:25:59] <dimadima> intense
[05:26:04] <dimadima> where was this
[05:26:17] <wrl> imode: the colourways limited time thing is one of the most boneheaded things i've ever seen in software
[05:26:46] <imode> a discord server for a fangame. it runs like shit on my machine and I did some rudimentary analysis and offered some feedback, asked lightheartedly if I could see the source so I could patch it for a local copy.
[05:27:16] <imode> wrl: I don't understand the motivation. someone's got a quota for something.
[05:28:23] <dimadima> well you know what they say about arch users..
[05:28:30] <dimadima> always want that open source
[05:29:55] <imode> I can't run the game without it pegging my CPU, so my hypothesis is that it's just shit programming and someone with an ego problem that can't take criticism. metroid fans and the metroid dev community for the past 20 years has been like it's guarding trade secrets.
[05:29:55] <dimadima> imode: you see that sweet post a while back about someone reverse engineering a json parsing bug in some game
[05:29:59] <dimadima> EA game i think
[05:30:02] <imode> rockstar.
[05:30:07] <imode> GTA 5's loading screen iirc.
[05:30:15] <dimadima> yeah that's right
[05:30:40] <dimadima> that was cool
[05:30:42] <imode> you stop tying code to your identity the moment you figure out how a decompiler works.
[05:31:02] <dimadima> why
[05:31:44] <imode> because anybody can figure out what you've done at that point. a lot of developers have "closed source" code because they guard their creation via obscurity.
[05:31:45] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[05:33:02] <dimadima> oh maybe i'm not sure what you mean by tie to your identity
[05:33:16] <dimadima> you mean like derive self worth
[05:33:16] <dimadima> or
[05:33:27] <dimadima> anonymity
[05:33:33] <imode> deriving self worth.
[05:33:36] <dimadima> ah
[05:34:11] <imode> "I'm special because I wrote this thing but because I'm a novice I have to keep its implementation details a secret."
[05:34:19] <imode> "So I can keep thinking I'm special."
[05:34:33] <imode> and then someone decompiles your stuff and posts it somewhere and then you get very, very angry.
[05:34:52] <dimadima> like when someone right-click-saves your NFT
[05:35:11] <imode> _yeah_, but for programmers.
[05:35:21] <dimadima> sounds intense
[05:36:14] <imode> there were death threats exchanged between devs in this scene for one dev using some simple graphics that the other also used.
[05:36:30] <imode> it's idiots arguing about nothing feeling important about being mediocre.
[05:36:31] <dimadima> lol
[05:36:38] <dimadima> crazy yo
[05:37:36] <dimadima> sounds like a bad scene!
[05:37:56] <imode> it really, really is. -_-
[05:39:00] <dimadima> i like how nicely java can be decompiled
[05:39:07] <dimadima> i've never tried a java obfuscator though
[05:40:31] <dimadima> working on anything now imode
[05:40:38] <dimadima> been checking the sunset?
[05:41:03] <imode> yeee, though it's been incredibly cloudy.
[05:41:21] <dimadima> one of the last shows i watched a lot of was madmen
[05:41:40] <dimadima> and i could have _sworn_ that in the last episode they watch the sunrise over the pacific
[05:41:50] <dimadima> after a night of meditating or something
[05:42:13] <dimadima> cause it's the 60s or something
[05:44:07] <imode> lmao, yeah that was a fad for a while.
[05:46:27] <dimadima> but the sun doesn't rise over the pacific?
[05:47:03] <imode> wait..
[05:47:11] <imode> _sunrise_ over the pacific? lmao.
[05:47:30] <imode> maybe over the mountain ranges, but not over the ocean.
[05:47:38] <dimadima> i could have sworn
[05:47:43] <dimadima> it was a beach scene for sure
[05:47:58] <dimadima> i could have misunderstood it

[06:16:52] <bkero> Starcraft too
[06:17:11] <jjuran> One of the issues I deal with in Advanced Mac Substitute is that the emulator is designed to run "all out" rather than emulate a clock speed, but some applications are designed to be the only thing running on a machine with no power management
[06:18:09] <jjuran> … where there's a fixed number of cycles per time period, so it doesn't matter whether you spend them in a busy loop or if the OS does
[06:18:12] <imode> the thing that irked me wasn't the poor perf, that could be put aside. it was the borderline "I'm protecting trade secrets therefore fuck your machine" attitude that nearly every dev in that space has.

[19:09:33] <indigo> I see a lot of “ex-Googler here, treat my opinion as gospel please”
[19:19:31] <Brekkjern> I mean... They demonstrated good knowledge of how to flatten a binary tree and some other algo shit during the interview that most bachelor students could manage to do with reference material...
[19:19:45] <Brekkjern> They are pretty much the elite of all of us, right?
[19:19:54] <indigo> But they didn’t use reference material, so they are elite!
[19:20:29] <Brekkjern> Pretty much
[19:22:07] <ngoldbaum> elite google doc coding skills
[19:22:44] <ngoldbaum> indigo: how often in your day-to-day do you find yourself inverting a binary tree in a google doc? must happen a lot
[19:25:47] <indigo> ngoldbaum: all the time. Also calculating the skyline formed by buildings
[19:26:23] <companion_cube> when you say "inverting", what does that actually mean?
[19:27:05] <indigo> IIRC, inverting is swapping all the branches recursively
[19:27:23] <companion_cube> like swapping left and right? not children/parent?
[19:27:43] <indigo> I think so
[19:27:59] <indigo> How would you swap children/parent? Which child wins?

[19:33:56] <companion_cube> indigo: well it'd be an inverted forest, not a tree anymore
[19:34:21] <companion_cube> heh, yeah, inverting that way is never useful
[19:34:47] <ngoldbaum> to demonstrate you are aware of recursion?
[19:35:19] <companion_cube> yeah it's a pretty simple thing
[19:35:25] <ngoldbaum> a secret handshake that demonstrates you may have seen undergrad CS curriculum
[19:35:28] <companion_cube> it's also fun to prove `invert (invert x) = x`
[19:35:45] <companion_cube> but otherwise, if you want proper recursion, there are more fun and interesting things to do, idk
[19:35:49] <edk> i don't understand the problem with this question tbh
[19:35:51] <ngoldbaum> the whole leetcode thing is there to exclude people who don’t have undergrad CS degrees or equivalent knowledge
[19:35:54] <companion_cube> even symbolic differentiation is cute and simple
[19:35:58] <edk> it's stupid, but it's also trivial

[19:42:25] <buttsbot> Twatter - lindsey - My jaw is on the floor. I just got an email from a grad student at a top-25-in-the-US CS school, offering me cash to help him with his homework.
[19:50:02] <dimadima> is that jaw dropping?
[19:52:05] <companion_cube> it's kind of surprising, in grad school you should be able to do your own homework, no?
[19:57:56] <ngoldbaum> also valences of sexism, younger woman faculty member gets cold-called for personalized help at a lowball rate for their time
[20:02:29] <dimadima> i guesssss, i mean, if you need help w/ homework in gradschool you probably shouldn't be in gradschool or at least you're not going to be a good academic most likely
[20:03:10] <dimadima> just need some help?
[20:03:15] <dimadima> sometimes?

[20:28:03] <hoistbypetard> dimadima: I don't think it's necessarily bad in a "cheating" way. and while i might suggest that grad school is a poor choice for those who feel the need to pay a tutor with the homework exercises there, that's not what rubs me the wrong way about it either. I think it's the presumption in the approach...
[20:28:21] <hoistbypetard> The student says he likes her lectures and Robert Morris'. And like her, I doubt he approached Morris. It is weird that it seemed "more OK" to approach her and ask if he could throw her $100/hr to tutor. But I think it could've even been an OK question if he'd reformulated to "Hey, I'm struggling with this material the way it's presented in my classes. I find your approach easier, based on your online lectures. Could you possibly
[20:28:21] <hoistbypetard> refer me to a tutor who approaches the subject in a similar way." (Possibly adding "My budget is $X"). I don't think that kind of formulation would've dropped anyone's jaw.

[22:34:35] <jjuran> indigo: Yes, more cases proves you're testing more effectively
[22:35:12] <indigo> Speaking of, I should probably use one of my many covid tests today
[22:35:24] <indigo> I ordered 20 but my company sent me 40 instead

[22:49:12] <Brekkjern> indigo: Likely the world's largest single outbreak of Omicron in Oslo after a party
[22:49:55] <ngoldbaum> outside of south africa anyway
[22:50:00] <indigo> Jeez
[22:50:32] <indigo> People are still coming in to the office and poorly masking here, I don't think anyone gives a shit
[22:50:39] <bkero> Until I heard otherwise this morning I would have believed that
[22:50:55] <bkero> Apparently the US got their second case today. Minnesota. From someone who went to an Anime con in NYC.
[22:51:15] <bkero> Anime convention = infection hotspot anyway
[22:52:30] <indigo> At least nowadays the smell probably isn't so bad if you're masking ;-)
[22:55:04] <ngoldbaum> you can pretty safely assume omicron is everywhere at this point
[22:55:27] <ngoldbaum> just like OG covid in jan/february 2020
[22:55:39] <companion_cube> does it seem to be less deadly? more?
[22:55:56] <ngoldbaum> no one knows yet
[22:56:09] <ngoldbaum> it takes time and careful measurement to tell
[22:56:33] <ngoldbaum> there are certainly still hospitalizations in botswana and south africa, and it seems to be highly transmissable
[22:57:54] <companion_cube> if it were more transmissible and less dangerous that'd be actually good
[22:59:34] <ngoldbaum> i’m not sure that’s clear actually, since if it’s more transmissable then ultimately more people (including more people who get severe outcomes) will contract it
[23:00:05] <ngoldbaum> so even if virulence goes down, if transmissability also goes up that might more than cancel the benefit from decreased virulence
[23:00:30] <companion_cube> to me, it's clear everyone will get covid sooner or later
[23:00:49] <companion_cube> so if a more contagious, less virulent variant occupies the space, we're safer in some sense
[23:01:20] <ngoldbaum> not if that knocks out hospitals while that wave of infection is being processed
[23:01:49] <ngoldbaum> thankfully turning the crank on rolling out a new vaccine isn’t so onerous, but it’ll still take at least a couple months
[23:02:25] <ngoldbaum> also probably the current vaccines offer at least some protection, possibly a lot
[23:02:26] <companion_cube> ah yeah, you're right, hospitals :/
