[01:26:29] <sharktamer> anyone got any idea why qutebrowser has gone all glitchy lately?
[01:26:34] <sharktamer> glitched rendering
[01:26:43] <sharktamer> I'm on arch linux and I did a package upgrade recently
[01:26:46] <The-Compiler> sharktamer: it's a mesa bug, see the pinned issues
[01:26:55] <sharktamer> yeah imagined it was a known bug
[01:27:38] <The-Compiler> Happened in December and affects more than just qutebrowser, yet somehow no fix is merged so far
[01:28:37] <sharktamer> erg
[01:28:47] <sharktamer> well I just did the reccomended downgrade, had the package in my cache

[02:17:20] <topcat001> does running a gl backed compositor help?
[02:24:49] <topcat001> For me picom with gl works around most of the issues.
[02:28:01] <topcat001> Incidentally when I use an nvidia card there are no issues, presumably because nvidia has it own libs.

[06:30:52] <bdju> so I've complained about this before, but this newer-than-I-had-been-using-lately qutebrowser has an annoying bug where characters get duplicated when typing sometimes. also the change to tab in the download file browser thing is horrible. but I said that once also
[06:30:58] <bdju> I wonder if I'm still behind a version
[06:31:06] <bdju> 2.4.0
[06:31:25] <bdju> oh, that's really the latest on github
[06:31:56] <bdju> wow there are so many issues I'm not sure I can find if there are any for these things yet
[06:32:11] <ectospasm> Welcome to open source!
[06:36:58] <bdju> I report issues a lot and usually things aren't this bad, but... yeah I guess
[06:37:18] <bdju> I mean it's a shame there aren't more contributors, no fault of the active ones really
[06:38:23] <ectospasm> I've only recently been using qutebrowser.  I had one idea for something to fix, but The-Compiler warned me against it.
[06:38:31] <bdju> interesting
[06:38:41] <ectospasm> The other one someone showed me something I didn't know.
[06:39:02] <ectospasm> Like open will show anything you have bookmarked, too
[06:39:14] <ectospasm> I thought it was just raw history

[15:09:51] <bdju> The-Compiler: the typing duplication thing is like when in the : box, doing o or O usually. I'll try to quickly enter the text for one of my quickmarks and hit enter and then I see some letters were duplicated and it's done a search instead. did not happen on older versions.
