[21:05:59] <flatcap> yes.  I just updated to F35 this week
[21:06:33] <flatcap> the latest shiniest toys without too much instability
[21:07:40] <adray> It's regular fedora and not silverblue, right?

[21:11:14] <adray> Were you ever a distro hopper?
[21:11:53] <flatcap> not really, no.  I used slackware in the 90s, then redhat, then fedora
[21:14:26] <flatcap> I've got a up-to-date compiler toolset, and a terminal emulator in full-screen
[21:14:51] <adray> Ah a very long time Linux user
[21:15:29] <flatcap> yeah, someone gave me a floppy with slackware on it, back in late 93, early 94
[21:16:29] <flatcap> well, the basic install was 6 floppies, which is nearly 9 Megabytes :-)
[21:17:28] <orin34> hi, could someone help me setting up pop3, i did configure "set folder = pops://...@.." , but how do i save mail in ~/mail/inbox now
[21:18:03] <adray> Did anyone help you or was it here some floppie#, install it?
[21:19:07] <flatcap> the latter, but it was pretty simple
[21:19:28] <flatcap> getting my machine to dual boot with Windows 3.1 (I think) took a bit of thought
[21:20:53] <flatcap> hi orin34.  you can tag emails with 't' or tag using patterns with 'T'
[21:20:56] <flatcap> https://neomutt.org/guide/advancedusage.html#patterns
[21:21:47] <flatcap> then 's' will save an email or ';s' which means <tag-prefix><save> will move the emails to another folder
[21:23:34] <flatcap> adray: what/when was your first non-Windows distro?
[21:28:51] <adray> while i played with ubuntu/fedora in high school, i consider my first serious/full time experience to be  between my sophomore and junior year of college (~2016) with fedora.
[21:30:39] <flatcap> I got hook on unix 2nd year at uni, too.   Sun Workstations, wow they were nice :-)
