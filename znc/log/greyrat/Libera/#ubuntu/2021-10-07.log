[09:05:55] <TheBigK> the answer for backported packages in lts is ppas, right?
[09:06:16] <TheBigK> i need a newer tar version in focal... but dont want dist-upgrade or compile it myself.. :/
[09:06:28] <TheBigK> i checked for ppas... but didnt find any...

[09:09:52] <TheBigK> danielssan: what means reboot of the backports team? so theres something ongoing with that?
[09:11:20] <danielssan> TheBigK: the old team didn't do much in the last few lts releases, that's why it was dormant, and they started a bit ago to reboot the backporting effort. but it's still ongoing before somebody can push backports
[09:11:30] <danielssan> TheBigK: btw, what are you looking for as a backport
[09:11:54] <TheBigK> a newer tar version
[09:12:20] <TheBigK> im building something inside docker but tar refuses to untar it...
[09:12:36] <TheBigK> when i donwload that package from jenkins
[09:12:42] <TheBigK> with newer tar version there are no issues

[09:15:26] <danielssan> TheBigK: so why not just building it yourself then? it's very straightforward
[09:15:46] <TheBigK> i know it is... but i lose the ability to update...
[09:16:03] <TheBigK> i mean... automatically
[09:16:19] <TheBigK> i could rebuild the debian package... and update that way... mhhh
[09:16:23] <TheBigK> how hard is that?
[09:16:35] <danielssan> TheBigK: which is very likely also with a ppa (in my opinion, as you can't be sure)

[12:20:36] <agvantibo> Hello. I'm having a trouble with the default Ubuntu icon theme (Yaru) - the back to windowed mode icon is not present. I've located the issue by switching themes via gnome-tweaks (it worked and the icon was replaced), but I really like Yaru and simply switching the theme wouldn't be a solution for me. A google search of the issue yields no sensible results. Here are pictures of what happens:
[12:20:38] <agvantibo>  screenshot of media player that utilizes the icon - no icon with Yaru theme: https://i.imgur.com/w47Feqp.png
[12:20:40] <agvantibo>  screenshot of the same player in the same condition but with the Adwaita icon theme https://i.imgur.com/V971bAl.png
[12:20:42] <agvantibo>  Here is the system version and other stuff. My system is 100% up to date. https://i.imgur.com/rPPDUCu.png

[15:04:55] <Peanut> Hi - my desktop is on 21.04, and I've been using my Nikon DSLR camera as a webcam since the whole pandemic thing for meetings. This is done through 4vl2loopback, gphoto2 and ffmpeg. However, recently this has stopped working. Camera shutter still opens, but no video.
[15:05:51] <Peanut> None of the packages mentioned above seem to have had recent changes.
[15:06:30] <EriC^^> Peanut: try to simplify it maybe and follow it step by step to see where it goes bad

[15:41:56] <Tuna-Fish> So here's a weird one: On 21.04 on a intel macbook (late 2008), ubuntu runs, but changing the display background more than once reliably hangs the machine (mouse doesn't move and no keyboard input does anything, nothing moves on screen). Machine turns off by holding power down key, then on boot the display background will have changed to what was last selected
[15:42:29] <Tuna-Fish> Nothing useful in logs.
[15:42:43] <Tuna-Fish> Anyone have any idea on how to even start figuring out what is wrong here?

[23:01:38] <wrsuser> as it installs a seemingly booting system... yet the screen is black until you hit the power button and then you see the purple text ubuntu screen briefly as it shuts down
[23:01:44] <t3nj1n> @donofrio, is it running in a program or is it running in a browser

[23:02:12] <jmiahjones> Cool, glad you figured it out though! If you really want to go that deep into configuring a really minimal system, knock yourself out.

[23:03:44] <jmiahjones> Not that that's really different from regular use, hah. wrsuser: Might I ask what problems you have with subiquity?
[23:03:48] <wrsuser> AH! "even if there's no prompt ALT-F2 works (switching to single-user mode), then you can login"

[23:04:19] <wrsuser> jmiahjones, it is too presumptuous in installing a load of stuff you might never need
[23:04:25] <wrsuser> and it's frickin huge
[23:04:30] <brainswithballs> Love this guys, keep going
[23:04:46] <wrsuser> and it's not as easy to use as the normal debian-installer ... looks like something gentoo would use 20 years ago
[23:04:56] <wrsuser> in short... over engineered

[23:07:44] <jmiahjones> wrsuser: It seems like it comes down to preference. Yeah, minimal it is not. But it simplifies things for people who aren't too concerned with some extra config and would rather subiquity just "figure it out."

[23:08:17] <jmiahjones> Have you thought about using cloud-init/ansible on top of a base image to deploy a minimal system?
