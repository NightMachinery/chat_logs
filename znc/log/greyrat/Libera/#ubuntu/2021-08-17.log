[06:22:25] <Guest7> the reason why you would want to do it is to capture a core dump?
[06:23:06] <leftyfb> Guest7: the core dump is only used to troubleshoot the issue that caused the kernel panic, which you never want to happen
[06:23:45] <SnoopJ> I think it's perhaps being too general to say this kind of troubleshooting is the only use of having a core dump in-hand.
[06:24:24] <SnoopJ> but I can't really think of what others there might be other than "I need to look at a core dump from this kernel right now" ?
[06:24:35] <leftyfb> SnoopJ: there's other, less crashy ways to get all the same information from your system for other purposes
[06:24:48] <SnoopJ> leftyfb, "the same information" being a core dump?
[06:24:52] <genii-core> I guess you could use it as some sort of state capture mechanism
[06:25:27] <leftyfb> all of that information should be in lsof and /proc/
[06:25:42] <SnoopJ> what if the information you want is the literal layout
[06:25:56] <leftyfb> layout?
[06:26:13] <SnoopJ> of kernel memory
[06:27:04] <SnoopJ> I mean, I get what you're saying, if you want [some particular information] then there is probably a better way to get it than crashing your system...

[23:27:59] <tarzeau_> and should i not be alone, is there a software watchdog checking internet and rebooting if gone? something small for cron @reboot poor mans version?
[23:28:03] <shinobi> tarzeau: Do you just have ... for an indicator?
[23:28:22] <tarzeau_> shinobi: no idea, it's 1200 km far

[23:30:14] <shinobi> tarzeau: I just solved a similar issue. The signal would get weak, or the router would try and switch to another band and network manager would get stuck. The router would also deauth the PC from time to time causing the same ... network prompt.
[23:30:32] <tarzeau_> shinobi: how was your fix?
[23:30:45] <shinobi> The solution was to have my modem/router just be a modem and upgrade my router. That solved all my issues. (Except for this on one boot.)
[23:31:35] <shinobi> Now I'm pulling 100Mbs over wifi down to my basement. :)
[23:31:50] <shinobi> (I only have 100Mbs service)
[23:32:07] <tarzeau_> well i've got an instrument taking measures, and it's too far for cable (another building), so i'm trying with wifi, which is nuts

[23:33:51] <shinobi> tarzeau: Do you have wifi in each building?
[23:36:08] <tarzeau_> one apple airport on 2nd floor, works fairly well on about 900m2
[23:36:33] <shinobi> shinobi: Because if you don't already have it. You could just get an access point that may have more range to hit the other wifi and penty of range to hit the wnic of the device taking readings.

[23:42:14] <shinobi> Rud0lf: Do you know what the expected behavior is if I have both my 2.4 and 5 networks set to "available to other users"? Does it connect to the best network at boot? Does it connect to the last one? Both are set to auto connect.
[23:42:40] <rud0lf> i think you can set priority
[23:42:54] <rud0lf> not sure if -1 is stronger or weaker than 1 tho
