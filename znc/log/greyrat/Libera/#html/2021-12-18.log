[21:00:57] <nbjoerg> at least not officially
[21:01:16] <nbjoerg> you can strictly speaking spell xhtml as valid xml, but most people don't

[21:14:00] <stenno> i thought xhtml being valid xml is all xhtml is about
[21:25:11] <nbjoerg> stenno: sorry, I meant you can spell html5 as valid xml, but it is not the expectation
[21:25:32] <nbjoerg> consider e.g. how <p> is used
[21:36:01] <stenno> well yeah you can, slash for self-closing tags is optional
[21:41:23] <nbjoerg> stenno: that would be <br>
[21:41:41] <nbjoerg> stenno: <p> is used as a separator tag in classic html(5) and as a surrounding block in xhtml
[21:41:49] <stenno> that would be <br />
[21:41:56] <stenno> that is valid xml, isn't it?
[21:42:03] <stenno> i meant the slash is optional
[21:42:12] <stenno> in html5, you can write it <br> and <br />
[21:42:19] <nbjoerg> sure, but <br> has no content, so it is boring
[21:42:24] <stenno> and <br /> is the xhtml-conform element
[21:42:40] <stenno> i _can_ do <p>Hello
[21:42:47] <stenno> but i also _can_ do <p>Hello</p>
[21:43:16] <stenno> i assume we are talkign about the same things, i am just a bit dense sometimes
[21:45:53] <nbjoerg> well, traditional html use would be: hello <p> world
[21:46:03] <nbjoerg> and not <p> hello </p><p> world</p>
[21:46:32] <nbjoerg> and expect the parser to fix it up
[21:46:59] <stenno> ...huh?
[21:47:50] <stenno> i am certain that this is not correct
[21:48:01] <stenno> foo <p> bar would be `foo <p> bar</p>`
[21:48:19] <stenno> and not `<p>foo</p><p>bar</p>`
[21:48:26] <nbjoerg> I don't disagree, it's just so very common
[21:48:40] <stenno> <p> are autoclosing
[21:48:50] <stenno> i have never seen p used as a seperator
[21:49:02] <stenno> also i thought autoclosing was a html5 feature

[23:04:40] <nbjoerg> lilmonkey`: not according to the spec, but according to what a lot of the real world used to do
[23:05:03] <stenno> you maybe mixed it up with self-closing <p> tags in html5
[23:06:29] <lilmonkey`> Yeah, no. I've been doing this for 25 years and that was never common. And how could it have been? It would have had undesirable results. Parsers never "fixed" that to what you suggested.
