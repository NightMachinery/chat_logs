[03:13:29] <Alipha> merpnderp: you're assuming that the website or whatever this password is for has picked a good password hashing algorithm. If the website is using MD5 or such, then an attacker can do billions or trillions with a small group of machines: https://gist.github.com/epixoip/a83d38f412b4737e99bbef804a270c40
[03:13:53] <merpnderp> Alipha: if my password manager is using md5, I've already messed up.
[03:14:40] <merpnderp> Every password manager out there is using something that limits attempts to at most 10's of thousands of attempts a second. 
[03:14:49] <Alipha> Oh, this is for a password manager? Okay. How long does it take for the password manager to decrypt its database, btw? I have my parameters set such that it takes about 1 second
[03:15:09] <merpnderp> I have no idea. 
[03:15:43] <merpnderp> I'm still trying to figure out a master password :D
[03:15:49] <Alipha> Is there a noticeable delay between you entering the password and your password manager opening up?
[03:15:51] <Alipha> Oh
[03:16:24] <merpnderp> I would assume that every password manager returns in constant time to protect against timing attacks. 
[03:16:53] <merpnderp> That's the first thing I'd do if writing my own. Success or fail, all return in 500ms. 
[03:17:41] <merpnderp> But if you mean attacking the actual vault, then I have no idea. 
[03:17:42] <Alipha> How fast it takes is a function of how powerful the computer is
[03:18:15] <Alipha> And how intensive you configured the hashing algorithm to be
[03:18:25] <merpnderp> But keepass uses the same algo as Bitwarden, so I assume its the optimal one.

[03:28:49] <Alipha> merpnderp: so, from what i recall, KeePass's default settings are a little lower than typically desired because they want the default settings to be responsive even on a low-end computer. i would suggest installing KeePass on the slowest computer you're going to have KeePass on (probably your phone, if you're going to put KeePass on your phone), and then go to the Database Settings -> Security. Change Key
[03:28:52] <Alipha> derivation function to Argon2, enter 3 iterations and 2 for parallelism, and then play around with appropriate Memory settings until you find a delay that you're comfortable with (you can click the Test button to determine the delay for the provided settings). For instance, on my somewhat beefy computer, i have 3 iterations, 128 MB of memory, and 2 parallelism. pressing Test takes about 0.9 seconds.
[03:29:02] <ash_worksi> is there a word for a hash result that differentiates itself from one that just bytes, as one that contains information such as the hash function, salt, rounds, etc?
[03:30:02] <merpnderp> Alipha: That's a good question. Why are people using PBKDF2 when ARGON2 is available? 
[03:31:32] <merpnderp> But even so, what's the faster that PBKDF2 can be hashed? 
[03:31:37] <Alipha> merpnderp: people aren't hip with the times? :-) um, compatibility.

[03:33:14] *** Joins: koolazer (~koo@user/koolazer)
[03:34:13] <Alipha> merpnderp: so, all password hashing or key derivation algorithms are customizable, to allow you to decide how fast or slow you want it to be. people typically run PBKDF2 with anywhere between 1000 to 100,000 iterations. you could run it with 1 iteration, whcih means it would be no better than a single SHA256
[03:34:53] <merpnderp> bit warden says they use 100,000 on the client and then server is 200,001. 
[03:35:21] *** Joins: Chouhartem (~fmoumou@epheme.re)
[03:35:55] <merpnderp> So if someone stole the vault off the client, that still seems like the most powerful attacker you'd face could only attack at maybe 100,000 hashes/second.
[03:36:00] <Alipha> and argon2 is much better than PBKDF2 because argon2 requires RAM to do its hashing and not just pure cpu speed
[03:36:19] <merpnderp> Yeah, if I use keepass, I'll definitely use argon2
[03:36:46] <ash_worksi> is `yescrypt` a thing that's in that debate?

[03:40:48] <ash_worksi> as opposed to generic hash function output (like 2c26b46b68ffc68ff99b453c1d30413413422d706483bfa0f98a5e886266e7ae)

[06:25:30] <LTCD> Hey. I came across this on Crypto StackExchange and I was wondering what LR means for the oracle? I guess it means Left and Right but no idea as to the context. https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/32201/lr-oracle-experiment-in-lindell-and-katz

[08:12:38] <tusko> @Alipha, I think that's exactly right. I only have (and wish to decrypt) a single block
[08:13:42] <tusko> Its one block, encrypted with a 64-bit key, of which I know the first 15 bytes are 0s (e.g. 000000000000000000000000000000??)
[08:20:20] <Peng> What.
[08:20:44] <Alipha> tusko: why wouldn't you just decrypt it instead of trying to encrypt all possible 256 plaintext blocks?
[08:21:14] <tusko> I'm trying to decrypt the known-ciphertext with all 256 possible keys
[08:21:48] <Alipha> Oh, sorry, I misread
[08:22:07] <tusko> but apparently openssl enc -d -aes128 -in ciphertext.enc -out plaintext.dec -k "$(printf "0x%0.32x" $key) is not the way to do it
[08:22:15] <tusko> where key is each of those possible strings

[10:55:54] <wasamasa> tusko: I really recommend to use your favorite programming language instead, where it becomes blatantly obvious if you get the format of the key wrong
[10:56:01] <wasamasa> tusko: it's -K, not -k
[10:56:28] <wasamasa> tusko: or so the synopsis in the man page claims, lol
[10:56:55] <wasamasa> tusko: but further down it mentions that -k derives a key from the password, which is not plain AES
[10:57:43] <wasamasa> tusko: use openssl or whatever other crypto library programmatically instead
[11:00:52] <wasamasa> tusko: ideally not openssl directly because it's full of footguns
[11:01:35] <snappy> but openssl cli is great for these exact scenarios of selecting modes, providing raw keys, etc. 
[11:02:06] <wasamasa> silent failure is not great
[11:02:47] <wasamasa> when you get no indication about mistaking -K for -k, you've goofed
[11:02:50] <snappy> oh you're right aobut the -k versus -K
[11:03:24] <snappy> yeah i mean it's got its warts, but using openssl cli is quick, avoid having to write code

[21:24:11] <tusko> openssl gave me a lot of problems
[21:24:25] <tusko> I wound up using pycrypto (which also was a bitch)
[21:25:12] <tusko> I now know that the ciphertext is 5beed72ac6c91e16e5a705cbb4cf4417 and the key is 00000000000000000000000000000042.
[21:25:36] <tusko> But even knowing that wasn't enough.
[21:27:12] <tusko> I had to convert both the ciphertext and all 256 keys to binary, then decrypt them using decipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EBC) --> decipher.decrypt(msg).
[21:27:28] <tusko> I still haven't figured out how to do this with openssl tho
[21:28:13] <ms7821> probably easier to use cyberchef
