[00:15:39] <oldlaptop> Unless the quoted price is per year, I'd guess it's per month.
[00:15:44] <epony> you can do the math on 100 Mbps/hr
[00:16:04] <davros> a user will typically get 50mb served per visit, i'm not exactly anticipating millions of visitors just yet
[00:16:05] <bomb> that's bandwidth vs transfer cap
[00:16:09] <epony> a month has about 720 hrs roughly
[00:16:36] <bomb> "100 Mbps/hr" does not make sense at all
[00:16:43] <epony> it does

[08:09:25] <furrykef> I find myself conflicted about conditionals of the form `if not foo: ... else: ...`
[08:09:57] <oldlaptop> I suppose it's *possible*, in theory, that form'd be the clearest choice sometime.
[08:10:32] <furrykef> I almost always avoid it, but sometimes the negative is far more likely
[08:13:26] <furrykef> Case in point, in my dictionary software, I just wrote code tantamount to, "If the infinitive ends with 'd', add 'ed' to the past stem, else drop the last letter from the past stem first and then add 'ed'"
[08:13:42] <furrykef> s/infinitive/infinitive stem/
[08:13:52] <furrykef> But the vast majority of infinitive stems don't end with 'd'
[08:14:39] <oldlaptop> I suppose it's down to whether you think that makes it clearer to express the logic in negative terms.
[08:15:38] <oldlaptop> (trying to put the more-likely branch "first" for performance reasons is the kind of micro-optimization you don't do without measurement, at least not when there's any cost to it whatsoever)

[14:17:06] <nomagno> Then the 'ret ID' jumps to the dynamic return
[14:17:34] <ProfSimm> nomagno: ah well you kinda did implement a call stack, the ret IDs form a linked list, which is also a stack :)
[14:17:47] <ProfSimm> But it's a more flexible stack I guess
[14:17:52] <nomagno> ProfSimm: yeah I guess it's just flat
[14:18:13] <nomagno> Like a preprocessor, it is equivalent to copy-pasting the subroutines in place :P
[14:18:46] <ProfSimm> I'm trying to avoid copying subroutines, while creating the semantics as if I am.
[14:19:00] <ProfSimm> Copy-on-Write basically
[14:19:10] <BASHitup> K, so I'm freshing up on first order logic to get into programming. In my textbook, there is an example of Taller(Claire, Max), which essentially translates into Claire being taller than Max. Do any actual programming langauges take that form? 
[14:19:20] <ProfSimm> Whole thing relies on Copy-on-Write (COW) for its life
[14:19:24] <nomagno> ProfSimm: a quirk I programmed in is if you happen to run into a 'func ID' instruction, it registers the subroutine start/end PCs and skips it
[14:19:32] <Inline> BASHitup: look into prolog
[14:19:39] <Inline> BASHitup: swi-prolog maybe
[14:19:48] <nomagno> So you have to put the subroutines at the start of the program, and they can't be executed without a call
[14:20:19] <nomagno> Or well, a 'jmp' to but if you jmp into a subroutine you're asking for the program to crash, and you know it :P

[14:24:03] <nomagno> ProfSimm: because it has RISC-like features in the instruction set sense, but it doesn't use the load/store architecture so it ends up being fairly primitive and 60s/70s-like
[14:24:39] <nomagno> ProfSimm: Hm... I don't know what you mean
[14:24:55] <ProfSimm> nomagno: I mean basically multitasking. Like how Erlang does it (no explicit threads)

[14:25:29] <nomagno> Oh I guess, I have no sense of local state
[14:25:33] <ProfSimm> nomagno: I mean you have foo and bar, you call foo, it wants to read a file (IO) and execution continues to an event loop where bar is executed while foo waits
[14:25:52] <ProfSimm> nomagno: then file data arrives, and foo is resumed

[16:47:34] <Bou> and yet it's all just clever statistics, I wouldn't call it "AI"

[16:47:47] <ProfSimm> Bou: I'm afraid we're there
[16:48:18] <ProfSimm> toulene: NN solutiosn tend to be MORE efficient, not less. Also running NN on GPU is outdated

[16:48:33] <toulene> do people like fpgas now
[16:49:24] <ProfSimm> toulene: no, modern ARM chips have dedicated NN hardware. And some startups are doing next generation work on it, that takes magnitudes less power than before on NN

[16:50:13] <toulene> i am not
[16:51:49] <ProfSimm> toulene: most of our intelligence can be described as spotting patterns, and learning what patterns to map those patterns to that lead to desirable outcomes.

[16:52:23] <toulene> i am not a NN naysayer, why are you trying to convince me
[16:52:39] <toulene> but if you believe you can put all these software companies making simulators, renderers, analyzers or whatever else, i'd have expected the non-NN software to be extinct by now

[16:56:58] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[16:57:06] <Bou> self-driving cars powered by NN, scary imo

[18:16:08] <ProfSimm> s*
[18:16:28] <beaky> i love borrowing
[18:16:36] <nomagno> I don't think I know the popular meaning
[18:16:38] <nomagno> I know what scope is
[18:16:49] <beaky> using borrowing i can be more ram efficient so i can save on ram instead of making copies everywhere
[18:17:10] <ProfSimm> beaky: so why ask if you should do otherwise:)
[18:17:49] <nomagno> I don't really see how the borrow checker makes rust any more safe most of the time
[18:18:16] <nomagno> Lifetimes become extremely arbitrary, and how is limiting borrows to one at a time safer than allowing as many as need be?
[18:18:44] <ProfSimm> nomagno: they're not arbitrary, they're kinda the exact opposite, known statically
[18:19:12] <nomagno> I've never been able to statically figure out rust lifetimes
[18:19:12] <ProfSimm> nomagno: borrows are not limited to one in general, only mutable ones. Because you can't mutate one thing from two places at once, causes corruption and data races.
[18:19:32] <nomagno> They always seemed like the compiler went 'this use is out of scope because I think so'
[18:19:43] <nomagno> No physical symbol to let me know, like braces in C {}
[18:20:01] <ProfSimm> nomagno: it's out of scope when you move it by passing it as an argument
[18:20:46] <nomagno> Data races and corruption only happen in multithreaded contexts
[18:21:08] <ProfSimm> nomagno: that's what Rust was made for
[18:21:25] <nomagno> But it is also enforced within a single function!

[18:22:30] <ProfSimm> nomagno: if you borrow a thing to a function you get back the borrow and you can use it again, that's the point of calling it borrow
[18:22:46] <ProfSimm> nomagno: the default semantic is not borrow, it's move
[18:22:50] <ProfSimm> So you need to borrow
[18:24:50] <nomagno> ... Why is this any better than dumb data copies, which carry just as low a risk and put less mental toll on the programmer?
[18:25:03] <ProfSimm> nomagno: if move and mutable borrow could clone references, then there's nothing to stop you from branching off those references to different threads.

[20:33:45] <torstenvl> I have a weird question for those who are self-taught programmers... once you got to a plateau of what you could learn entirely by yourself, how did you move on from the plateau?  I don't program professionally so I don't have any mentors or coaches at work.  I'm almost considering doing an online certificate or something just to have people to give me feedback

[20:38:19] <oldlaptop> There's no reason in principle you can't study the deeper stuff on your own too, of course. Whether that works out better for you than formal schooling or education is a different question.

[20:39:13] <oldlaptop> Sure would be nice if more government lawyers knew a thing or three about computers.
[20:39:19] <InPhase> torstenvl: Yeah, by that point your self-learning ability should be pretty solid.  It's reasonable to get some textbooks for the material in upper level CS courses and go through the content.

[20:40:49] <oldlaptop> I'm more concerned with the policy implications of ignorance
[20:41:24] <torstenvl> Well, my practice area is military justice (I'm a JAG) so, sadly but for good reason, nothing I do can really change policy that affects you :)
[20:42:32] <InPhase> torstenvl: Following along with a textbook gives the structure that is missing with trial and error.  You will probably end up with very small numbers of questions that don't get addressed by using a textbook in sequence.  You can filter that set of remaining questions that arise by googling, and then ask in communities like this or others the questions that remain.  It would go pretty smoothly.  
[20:42:38] <InPhase> (While noting for anyone else reading along that this strategy tends to work better for the vast majority of people after already having a formal education.)

[23:00:49] <ishan> Hi, I tried to implement sha256 but I am running into really weird issues. one of the test case is to just run it on an empty input. Test cases passes, the output there is the same as `sha256sum` but when I run the program on the same input, I get a completely different hash. The padded input is same but the final state is different. I tried to figure this out on my own but I can't spot the problem.
