[02:07:56] <VectorX> boblamont the number of chars matched in a lookbehind have to be the same, ie January and July are not the same amount of chars
[02:08:00] <VectorX> as one example
[02:08:50] <boblamont> VectorX: So I should do it as 12 separate passes (one for each month)?
[02:09:27] <VectorX> can you add a sample string you are trying to match to the link

[04:34:12] <boblamont> digitok: Thanks! Nothing I found suggested anything like that, much appreciated.
[04:36:04] <VectorX> boblamont what exactly are you trying to achive
[04:37:05] <boblamont> VectorX: I'm trying to change all the parenthesis to double underscores for highlighted markup in Zim Desktop Wiki 
[04:39:47] <VectorX> you should have just opened with that, https://regex101.com/r/3kC7Wa/5
[04:47:02] <boblamont> VectorX: When I try that one, if captures the date, as well as both opening and closing parenthesis, the one digitok: gave matches only the parenthesis, which is what I'm going for
[04:48:14] <VectorX> boblamont the link I posted has an example of the substitute, __$1__
[04:48:22] <VectorX> what language are you using>?
[04:48:28] <boblamont> pcre
[04:48:36] <VectorX> like PHP?
[04:49:23] <boblamont> I'm using it in a text editor, Bluefish
[04:51:37] <VectorX> boblamont so if you paste the pattern in your search and,  __\1__  in the replace with
[04:51:40] <VectorX> try that out
[04:53:10] <boblamont> VectorX: It does replace both parenthesis, but it replaces the date with $1 (an actual "$1", so all the dates are __$1__)
[04:53:23] <VectorX> note __\1__
[04:53:47] <boblamont> ah, old on
[04:54:37] <boblamont> yes, works as it should
[04:55:41] <VectorX> thats how you would typically do a replace using regex, so that you dont have to do lookaround gymnastics, its a much simpler match and you use the groups to keep what you want
[04:55:53] <VectorX> you can move things around, change the order etc
[04:56:46] <VectorX> ex, look in the substitute pane below https://regex101.com/r/3kC7Wa/6 
[04:57:41] <VectorX> made another change to capture the whitespace inbetween and reuse so it is the same as the original, ie if it was a tab etc https://regex101.com/r/3kC7Wa/6
[04:58:56] <boblamont> Oh. That's life altering. I've been doing a lot of lookaround gymnastics.

[15:51:32] <digitok> is your input a single line
[15:59:26] <Guest6570> digitok yes
[15:59:53] <Guest6570> actualy in format `image = "nginx:1.16.9:"`
[16:02:11] <digitok> so the input includes 'image = ""' ?

[16:07:08] <Guest6570> yes, but thats easy to implement
[16:07:22] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/qbDGdl/5
[16:07:23] <Guest6570> dont know how to separate docker image registry format
[16:07:46] <digitok> you can remove all of the 07\n from the regex
[16:08:04] <Guest6570> thanks, there is little thing...
[16:09:17] <Guest6570> image can be in format bitnmai/nginx or in nginx ( usually docker cli is prefixing it with library/ ), so we need to figure out how to parse image format, maybe negative lookahead for `/` char as a separator?
[16:10:01] <digitok> are you saying group 2 should include "bitnmai" if it's there?
[16:10:03] <Guest6570> image = "myregistry/still/content/of/registry/bitnami/nginx:latest" or image = "myregistry/still/content/of/registry/nginx:latest"
[16:10:16] <Guest6570> both are valid
[16:10:19] <digitok> i see
[16:10:54] <digitok> can it be anything other than bitnmai and nginx?
[16:13:13] <Guest6570> its in format <registry>/<namespace>/<image>:<tag>@<sha256>, but a lot of images dont have <namespace>
[16:13:31] <Guest6570> thus <registry>/<image>:<tag>@<sha256>
[16:14:05] <digitok> right, but "bitnmai/nginx" = image, correct?
[16:14:30] <digitok> or is bitnmai = namespace
[16:17:27] <Guest6570> bitnami is namespace
[16:17:37] <Guest6570> there is also image nginx without bitnami
[16:17:42] <digitok> ok so where do you want that to be returned
[16:17:56] <Guest6570> oh, sorry
[16:17:59] <Guest6570> its image
[16:18:07] <digitok> lol ok
[16:18:11] <Guest6570> :facepalm:
[16:18:12] <Guest6570> :D
[16:18:40] <Guest6570> docker image naming conventions are bit confusing
[16:19:04] <digitok> so can "image" be anything other than "bitnami/nginx" and "nginx" ?
[16:19:45] <Guest6570>  <registry>/<image>:<tag>@<sha256>  , where <image> can be in format <string/string>
[16:20:22] <digitok> ok so it's not always nginx

[16:25:15] <Guest6570> hmm
[16:28:30] <Guest6570>  docker.io/nginx is valid, and docker pull docker.io/library/nginx is valid too and they are same images ...
[16:29:02] <Guest6570> docker cli is adding library/ path by default, if is there no "namespace"
[16:31:46] <Guest6570> namespace can not contain "." char and registry is not valid without "." char probably

[16:33:17] <digitok> i see
[16:33:28] <digitok> so are you sure you don't want namespace as its own group?
[16:33:34] <digitok> or just keep it with image
[16:40:18] <digitok> this is what i have so far https://regex101.com/r/qbDGdl/6
[16:40:48] <digitok> this assumes registry always contains . in the portion before the first /
[16:41:12] <digitok> the issue i can see is for example in match 8
[16:41:46] <digitok> if the registry is there, the last portion before <image> will always be considered to be <namespace>
[16:42:18] <digitok> but i'm not sure how you could differentiate that from match 7 for example
