[00:58:26] <YorickPeterse[m]> Is there a nice way to keep track of user-triggered change counts per buffer? `vim.lsp.util.buf_versions` is also modified when e.g. formatting a buffer using LSP
[00:58:32] *** Quits: arthurpbs (~arthurpbs@168.121.99.40) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[00:59:17] <YorickPeterse[m]> For context: for https://gitlab.com/yorickpeterse/nvim-dd I made some changes so that diagnostics are not displayed if they are for an older buffer version, as new diagnostics will soon replace them anyway. I just now noticed that if a language server first formats the document, then produces the diagnostics, the buffer version changes, thus the diagnostics are not shown
[00:59:24] <YorickPeterse[m]> so you need another write/change to show them

[01:02:56] <YorickPeterse[m]> Hm actually, then I somehow have to map whatever that is to the LSP document version
[01:03:26] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah it’s hard
[01:03:34] <mjlbach[m]> We could pas through the ticks in context
[01:03:48] <mjlbach[m]> From on_lines
[01:03:59] <mjlbach[m]> Gets a little tricky with denouncing
[01:04:49] <YorickPeterse[m]> So the case that lead to this is something like this: you are in insert mode, and produce a bunch of diagnostics. using nvim-dd they are deferred until 1 second after you leave insert mode. If you then produce new diagnostics 0.8 seconds after leaving insert mode, that first batch of diagnostics is replaced quickly with the new ones
[01:04:55] <YorickPeterse[m]> this then results in "flickering" of signs, underlines, etc
[01:06:42] <mjlbach[m]> Yup

[01:16:21] <YorickPeterse[m]> since format requests don't trigger `didChange` requests in turn, I _think_ that could work

[01:23:52] <YorickPeterse[m]> I guess the hack I could do is defer my diagnostics again when the buffer versions mismatch, and ignore the versions that second time
[01:24:16] <bfredl> there is no such guarantee in the protocol IIRC
[01:24:21] <YorickPeterse[m]> If new diagnostics then come in, they cancel the defer anyway
[01:24:26] <YorickPeterse[m]> if not, they are shown
[01:24:26] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah there isn’t
[01:24:35] <bfredl> server updates diagnostics when it feels like.

[01:30:06] <YorickPeterse[m]> Mathias: Well the fix would be a new version of the spec that says everything is UTF-8, rather "it's UTF-8 except this one thing"

[01:35:09] <mjlbach[m]> Two options
[01:35:17] <YorickPeterse[m]> But setting that aside, I feel it's just bizarre MS went with UTF-16 for one part of the spec, and UTF-8 for the rest
[01:35:19] <mjlbach[m]> 1 allow sending text document specifiers
[01:35:34] <mjlbach[m]> So an editor can register its document version
[01:35:49] <YorickPeterse[m]> mjlbach: I had another idea: I can note down the buffer version when I first receive the diagnostics and defer them, then check if it's the same when I'm about to present them

[05:30:13] <barronpm[m]> So I haven't ever gotten _really_ good at using an editor before, the closest I've gotten is VSCode, where I know the basic keyboard shortcuts to do things like multi-cursor, selecting words, etc.
[05:30:13] <barronpm[m]> Are there any good resources for learning the different ways you can interact w/ nvim?
[05:30:13] <barronpm[m]> I've started using the tutor but I'm finding it hard to sit down and memorize all of the commands it teaches.

[11:44:00] <clason[m]> Well, just report the problem at vim/vim with the reproduction steps that don't require matchup (but link your matchup issue).
[11:45:07] <euoiaJamesPickar> Ah, it is already being tracked https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/6350

[11:45:53] <clason[m]> well, you could still link your issue (best to comment on the matchup issue with a link to the upstream issue)
[11:46:33] <euoiaJamesPickar> Yep, will do

[16:06:04] <bluemonksr[m]> Is there a way to setup luasnip with omnifunc?
[16:07:32] <clason[m]> not without a completion plugin that wraps omnifunc
[16:09:08] <bluemonksr[m]> i have a fork of completion-nvim that I have been updating for all the new API changes. I still prefer it becuase of all the ins-completion sources i can chain. like C-x-C-L for lines or C-K for dict when in latex etc.. 
[16:09:09] <bluemonksr[m]> was thinking if I can just do that with omni (ofcourse without the "auto" popup) then why bother with a plugin
[16:09:36] <bluemonksr[m]> but the biggest thing I miss is snippets expanding
[16:10:51] <clason[m]> yeah
[16:11:23] <clason[m]> you might be able to hack it with a `CompleteDone` autocommand
[16:12:07] <bluemonksr[m]> clason[m]: did not know of that autocommand! thanks
[16:12:41] <mjlbach[m]> Note it’s finnicky with the lsp omnifunc

[16:13:23] <bluemonksr[m]> mjlbach[m]: also i assume its not async?

[16:21:23] <hrsh7th[m]> I'm just curious, is neovim planning to bring most of the functionality defined in LSP to the core? (Snippets, LinkedEditingRange, SignatureHelp, CodeLens etc)
[16:22:16] <clason[m]> Yes, that's the goal as far as it's covered by the specification
[16:22:37] <clason[m]> (ideally in a way that benefits the whole editor, not just LSP)
[16:23:27] <clason[m]> hence https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/15579 ;)
[16:23:40] <hrsh7th[m]> So we should implement snippet expanding/jumping(selecting, choise) etc, right?
[16:24:17] <hrsh7th[m]> (of course, it should be overridable with external snippet plugin)

[19:55:13] <Shadman[m]> Ohh you meant luajit commit . Sorry
[19:57:41] <mjlbach[m]> If it happens reliably we could just do a git bisect in parallel with a ton of neovim containers
[19:57:53] <clason[m]> yeah, I think architecture and exact LuaJIT commit is the most important information here

[19:58:54] <kylo252[m]> maybe the issue should start including the luajit version 
[19:59:08] <kylo252[m]> * the issue template should start
[19:59:27] <clason[m]> most people won't be able to tell

[20:00:27] <clason[m]> That tells us pretty much nothing
[20:00:43] <clason[m]> LuaJIT has been on 2.1.0-beta3 for years; we need the exact commit
[20:00:57] <Shadman[m]> kylo252[m]: I think 3 years of commit has that same luajit version
[20:01:01] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: well that's one thing to consider fixing for the next release then 🥲
[20:01:16] <clason[m]> how?
[20:01:53] <kylo252[m]> there are more granular version generation by git than relying on a tag
[20:02:00] <clason[m]> if they build from source, we already know the pinned commit; if it's a distro, they just link to their distro library, and our build scripts have no idea

[20:10:31] <kylo252[m]> maybe people don't want to bother learning how to use the linker/build-system, or some legacy reason that's beyond me

[20:13:08] <kylo252[m]> gpanders: that's kinda the point I'm making, the build system is far simpler with a single free for all `-I ./src`

[20:31:35] <clason[m]> yeah, the compiled table operations are what I'm look at, too.
[20:31:53] <clason[m]> (if both people on the issue use ARM, tho, it could be something else)
[20:32:24] <clason[m]> I suspect there's an overflow somewhere, which only triggers since statusline updates constantly

[20:33:34] <kylo252[m]> isn't there a CI job for ARM? 
[20:33:55] <jamessan[m]> No
[20:34:40] <kylo252[m]> I had heard there's a qemu container that works pretty well for testing. I wouldn't be surprised that there are some mainstream gh actions to use something similar
[20:35:16] <jamessan[m]> I've looked before, because adding a big-endian CI is still on my list

[20:45:24] <kylo252[m]> if you don't care about ubuntu, then it's probably less fiddley to go with fedora for this. I think podman is shipped by default these days as well. so that should make setting up things even faster.

[23:03:37] <Mathias[m]> It uses the options supported by the language server protocol specification. What others would you want it to use?
[23:06:57] <kylo252[m]> Mathias[m]: the function does in general does, but the argument was about reading/parsing editorconfig which has more options in common with the protocol.
