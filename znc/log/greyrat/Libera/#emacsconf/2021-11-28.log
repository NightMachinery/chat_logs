[00:57:36] <opalvaults> It'd be nice to integrate unix pass, emacs, and nyxt along with some ad-blocking so I can replace Firefox for a more light way extensible browser.

[00:58:08] <maxxcan> I love this browser
[00:58:12] <kimjetwav> opalvaults: I should get back to it. I used it early and loved it, and then the dev added vim+cua keybinds and made emacs keys not the default and I lost track of how to use it, even though it's literally one funcall to get the keybindings back. It really is a great browser.
[00:58:16] <`andrea> `opalvaults definitely: they need a decent adblocking still

[00:58:49] <tgbugs> lounge-073: very late response, but the reason I talked about powershell more than the others is because it is the most different and required some explainiation, I also was :/ about that

[00:59:16] <Noisytoot> (if you add a '`' before my nick it doesn't highlight me)
[00:59:17] <NullNix> lounge-073: it's unfortunately necessary due to the number of website designers who override foreground colours to black without setting the background colour

[01:24:10] <esrh`> looks beautiful
[01:24:22] <opalvaults> I agree
[01:24:35] <NullNix> how much of that is just bigger margins and roboto though?
[01:24:39] <NullNix> roboto is beautiful
[01:24:41] <maxxcan> I love nano Emacs. I use it too
[01:24:52] <esrh`> i wonder if I can steal the splash screen and header line
[01:24:54] <opalvaults> I really think that the default emacs theme could use this kind of effort and scrutiny in order to improve it
[01:24:58] <NullNix> A4: good idea, but few people have A4 *screens*...
[01:25:14] <esrh`> holy crap it looks so good
[01:25:14] <Noisytoot> I don't think the default aspect ratio would work well on my screen (at least vertically)

[01:49:56] <sachac> We did the captioning using subed.el in Emacs, using the speakers' Org files or autogenerated captions from Youtube as starting points.
[01:50:06] <sachac> ooh, pad, will check
[01:51:03] <jrootabega> Oh yeah, will definitely find a way to volunteer next time!
[01:51:08] <opalvaults> Yeah absolutely, would love to donate.
[01:51:37] <sachac> for example, if some people could help with streaming alternate tracks, we could have longer talks and longer Q&As

[01:52:48] <sachac> so our current strategy is lots of short talks/demos, and then people can learn more about the stuff that they find interesting
[01:53:00] <zleap> sounds good
[01:53:01] <sachac> but it would be so nice to have more deep dives too
[01:53:05] <opalvaults> I think having alternate tracks is a great idea sachac, I think I noticed that speakers were very rushed because time was tight, and it'd be cool to that have that alleviated.
[01:53:27] <opalvaults> And it would likely reduce stress for you guys so that technical issues aren't as dire.
[01:53:30] <sachac> other conferences are more selective, I think, but... it's Emacs! we want everything!
[01:53:51] <zleap> sachac, maybe if we can figure out some topics that would be good to dive deeper into (attendee feedback) that could be looked in to
[01:54:05] <sachac> zleap: Maybe Org can spin off into its own conference

[01:56:58] <opalvaults> bandali: do you think there's a place for some kind of configuration management in this process? I'm DevOps lite, and curious how it could be streamlined if at all for Conf purposes

[18:49:39] <lounge-978> Agreed about the lack of formal grammar (only a proliferation of parsers) being a limiting factor. Maybe we could bridge directly to the available commands without going through a grammar though. A unified tree-editing framework across languages but definitely including Org would be awesome (ala lispy/etc).
[18:49:59] <Cairn> Wow, pretty Emacs setup
[18:50:53] <publicvoit> For Org mode, we do have https://github.com/200ok-ch/org-parser/blob/master/resources/org.ebnf EBNF which should be a good start IMHO.

[20:46:31] <ieure> I keep meaning to write some better randr/multihead stuff for EXWM, but I use it too infrequently for it to be a major annoyance, which is what drives most of my hacking.
[20:47:01] <bigodel[m]> i didn't realize Matrix uses the display name in the IRC rooms, instead of the actual username
[20:47:03] <opalvaults> ieure: I'm assuming that it alleviates some of those problems if the monitors are connected to a desktop that doesn't get messed with much.

[20:47:25] <ieure> opalvaults, Yeah, much better with a fixed setup.
[20:47:39] <opalvaults> I feel like that's a problem with all DE's/WM's though. Laptop/monitor integration can be a real pain.

[20:55:32] <ieure> bigodel[m], autorandr is like that, but much nicer.  You set stuff up how you want, then `autorandr -s home` (or work, or whatever).  Then you can `autorandr -c` and it'll autodetect the hardware config & apply the saved randr config.

[22:46:19] <paraparity> This has been really slick. Kudos for the captions including the Farsi characters and latin text.
[22:46:20] <sachac> Yay captions! =)
[22:46:26] <TDT> At first, I thought the captions would be unnecessary, but over time, understanding the accents for various individuals has been challenging, so the captions helped.

[22:51:37] <Cairn> Like johnw said in his review of Emacs 28, we're going to be getting a way to make temporary switching into an IME even easier. So it'll feel even more seamless.
[22:51:58] <TDT> I may have to try this, the IMEs I've used haven't been an issue too much in the past, but...maybe this would be better, at least I wouldn't have to worry about config on each qube.

[23:18:32] <Digit> clearly, imaginary programming needs a much longer talk.
[23:18:41] <matthewzmd> esrh: Yes, it uses PyQt5 and it's essentially painting the Qt frame on top of emacs, simulating a buffer. EPC is used for Elisp <-> Python <-> JS communication
[23:18:51] <aindilis> definitely.  this is a good intro though.
[23:19:07] <NullNix> tgbugs: idefun is implemented purely by its docstring, I suppose :P
[23:19:16] <ieure> jrootabega, I'm pretty sure that sound is in the talk recording.
[23:19:17] <opalvaults> Man, I really think it would be awesome to have shane be able to explain some of these ideas more in depth as they are obviously very deep topics. I'd love to help contribute next year to possibly creating a way to have multiple talks going on at once so people have more time to speak. I believe it was sachac who mentioned it yesterday.
[23:19:19] <aindilis> yeah that's a use-case, gen from docstring

[23:20:09] <lounge-459> libertyprime re slide 27, would it mean that 2 such "idefined" function would be the "same", meaning do the same thing the same way, given that they are defined without a "body"?

[23:42:34] <NullNix> hmm the bovination should move into a subthread really. It does get annoying with big C/C++ TUs too
[23:42:45] <NullNix> and it's just the sort of thing threads were added for
[23:43:31] <lilyp> CEDET predates threads by a decade though
[23:44:00] <tgbugs> this talk might fall into the emacs archeaology track
[23:44:02] <ieure> lilyp, This is the thing that implements (thing (eql :whatever)) specialization, should be a good starting point if you want (thing (string-match-p "^foo")): https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-generic.el#n1164
[23:44:04] *** Quits: lounge-459 (lounge459@front0.emacsconf.org) (Quit: EmacsConf The Lounge - https://chat.emacsconf.org)
[23:44:43] <Cairn> tgbugs: Emacs archaeology would be a wonderful thesis topic
[23:45:09] <tgbugs> Cairn: feels more like something that should be a prelim topic though
[23:45:25] <codingquark> I propose Emacs ship with modus-themes enabled by default
[23:45:31] <tgbugs> "prove that you are not trying to reinvent something that was finished 30 years ago"
[23:45:38] <NullNix> lilyp: oh yeah, it's a future change, not something that could possibly have been added when cedet was being written
[23:45:43] <Cairn> tgbugs: Fair
[23:45:46] *** Joins: lounge-544 (lounge544@front0.emacsconf.org)
[23:45:51] <NullNix> Eric never had a time machine, even if it looked like he did when wisent was written
[23:46:21] <gnu_ninja> @codingquark I think the modus themes are in elpa :/
[23:47:01] <codingquark> gnu_ninja: they indeed are. But what I'm saying is that instead of whatever thing Emacs first starts with, we switch that to use modus-themes
[23:47:04] <lounge-544> publicvoit : would it be worth considering a decoupling of the "orgdown" proposal into 1) just a proposal to rename "org" the markup as "orgdown" (vs "org-mode" for the piece of software running in Emacs), and 2) all the rest as in the levels/etc? Just to not put the first at risk of non-adoption because of the contents of the second? There seems
[23:47:04] <lounge-544> to be a lot of positive sentiment towards solving #1 for sure.
[23:47:25] *** Joins: matthewzmd (~user@72.138.17.58)
[23:47:30] <lilyp> ieure: thanks for the pointer, but I think I have some more pressing cl-defgeneric reimplementations to make before I touch that
[23:47:52] <lilyp> orgdown is not org, the markup
[23:48:06] <lilyp> orgdown is lightweight org, it does not have all the features
[23:48:07] <gnu_ninja> @codingquark I think they're going to be included in stock emacs. Prot is waiting for all the paperwork to be completed.
[23:48:18] <tgbugs> lounge-544: In general I agree, there will be issues with how to approach the levels
[23:48:25] <publicvoit> lounge-544: Valid approach but this train has left the station already by the decision of myself to provide OD1 to the public this weekend.
[23:48:26] *** Joins: marvinliu (bh2142@front0.emacsconf.org)
[23:48:27] <ieure> lilyp, Extremely fair.  One thing I didn't get to touch on is that you can extend generic functions from anywhere.  So you don't have to patch up cl-generic.el, you can define a new method for a generic function defined anywhere, in any file.  Which rules.
[23:48:43] * Cairn claps
[23:48:46] <TDT> Kinda curious what theme some of these people are using for their presentations.  Looks a lot different than mine.  Wondering almost if it's doom-macs or whatever that's called.
[23:48:55] <Cairn> loud
[23:48:56] <jeroentesttest[m> loud :)
[23:49:03] <jeroentesttest[m> better :)
[23:49:05] <codingquark> gnu_ninja: AIUI, wombat etc are also included in Emacs core right? Say, when I run `emacs -Q' what theme (if any) does it load?
[23:49:07] <tgbugs> od1 is fortunately minimally specified
[23:49:29] <ieure> TDT, I used the default theme on vanilla Emacs (+ 15 years of my hacks), and org-tree-slide.
[23:49:35] <lilyp> ieure yeah, I'll first try rewriting that part from my init.el before sending a patch, but still would be nice to have upstream support for regexp dispatch
[23:49:42] <lounge-544> lilyp : the larger point being the potentially contentious things to finalize about levels/etc (if any disagreement, but that's par for the course in the Emacs world), so we could fix this recurring naming thing that's come up many times in this chat so far, and build on this with the rest of the proposal.
[23:49:45] <zaeph> Don't forget to add your questions in the pad: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/emacsconf-2021
[23:50:19] <gnu_ninja> @codingquark Whatever the emacs default theme is. :/
[23:50:23] <ieure> lilyp, That it would.
[23:50:44] <tgbugs> lounge-544: the thing about levels is that they don't prevent more granular, featured based approaches
[23:50:45] <lilyp> To be fair, I personally don't think adding tiers to org-mode makes much sense
[23:51:01] <lilyp> We should rather have a feature matrix for stuff like pandoc to check against
[23:51:08] <ieure> The default Emacs theme is fine & I'll be cranky if I have to twiddle a setting to change it back.  That is all.
[23:51:10] <NullNix> I don't think the default colours constitute a theme, since themes are defined in terms of the change from the default (or, really, from whatever you're using now)
[23:51:23] <akrl> I loooove loop :)
[23:51:37] <ieure> loop / cl-loop is very good stuff.
[23:51:45] <tgbugs> lilyp: developing the test suite will get us there, and then we can have the discussion about how to market the levels
[23:51:51] <codingquark> NullNix: right, I suspected this and was trying to rephrase my question appropriately
[23:51:56] <akrl> half of native-comp is written in loop :D :D
[23:52:15] <bandali> :D
[23:52:26] <NullNix> codingquark: this is sometimes annoying, but of course it's an accident of history, in that emacs colour definition is decades older than themes...
[23:52:33] <lounge-544> lilyp tgbugs : both your comments highlight why it may be interesting to resolve the naming thing independently of the other aspects of the larger proposals (levels and such), to address only the recurring comments about this
[23:52:39] <ieure> I *hope* cl-loop is more efficient than building a bunch of intermediate lists when you chain map/filter/reduce operations.
[23:52:39] <NullNix> akrl: half of bindat is written in loop :P
[23:52:51] <lounge-544> lilyp tgbugs : just a thought though
[23:53:12] <corwin> ieure: it def is by the time it gets though nativecomp ;)
[23:53:20] <akrl> NullNix: loop party!!
[23:53:27] <tgbugs> lounge-544: I think we could adopt orgdown almost immediately without issue
[23:53:30] <lilyp> I don't really see a big issue with org-mode vs. org vs. orgWHATEVER though
[23:53:49] <tgbugs> there are major search and discovery issues with bare "org"

[23:54:04] <lilyp> Like what I use org for heavily depends.
[23:54:42] <lilyp> At one time, I'm calculating work hours, at another I'm writing (not Harry Potter, but still) fanfic.
[23:54:42] <tgbugs> I tend to use "org syntax" at the moment, but it isn't catchy enough
