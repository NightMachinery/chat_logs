[19:00:28] <sochotnicky> Heya folks, I've been moving things around - using org-mode + org-caldav to manage events/tasks etc. One thing that looks like it might help is to support recurring VTODO items (VEVENTs are already handled). 
[19:00:45] <sochotnicky> Specifically I can see RRULE handled in https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/org-mode.git/tree/lisp/ox-icalendar.el#n708
[19:01:38] <sochotnicky> but I don't see it a few lines below for VTODO - I'll go and play with patching things for that - just wondering if there's a specific reason for that omission?
[19:01:49] <sochotnicky> as far as I can tell the spec allows RRULE in VTODOs

[22:03:16] <aindilis> ty!  only consideration is how it roundtrips with existing Emacs org files.
[22:04:45] <sochotnicky> aindilis: well - I haven't tried :-) So far I mostly use org-caldav for events/todos (with nextcloud for actual backend) and orgzly for other document access/editing
[22:04:56] <aindilis> awesome
[22:05:48] <sochotnicky> I am still fighting with a few things, but it mostly it works... I am not much of lisp programmer, but I suspect sooner or later I'll have to dig in
[22:06:23] <aindilis> well, it seems pretty handy, and it certainly looks good.  If anything I could just do compatibility going forward.
[22:06:49] <aindilis> like create new .org files and use those in consistent ways with both Emacs and Organice
[22:08:42] <sochotnicky> in principle I do like caldav since its nice and supported in various ways so it's good from integration POV
[22:08:52] <sochotnicky> at least in theory...

[22:23:00] <aindilis> cool, I will check it out more.  I'm surprised that these systems haven't evolved beyond caldav (to my knowledge).  Especially since there have been efforts like CALO to make this stuff more complete.
[22:23:01] <aindilis> http://www.ai.sri.com/caloexpress/
[22:25:17] <aindilis> or integration with PDDL/OptaPlanner/etc
[22:26:29] <sochotnicky> At least for me - the last kinda missing piece is support for recurring tasks and proper two way sync of (most) edits.
[22:26:58] <sochotnicky> But yes, it's certainly not complete and more of a "DIY" puzzle pieces
[22:27:13] <aindilis> well sync is neat, so is recurring tasks.  I've implemented a Prolog-based languages for recurrences, but it's not quite as expressive as Org-mode's

[22:28:19] <aindilis> oh I see it doesn't have sync support?
[22:28:29] <aindilis> I thought you were saying it did both
[22:28:58] <aindilis> yeah, and then there's the whole privacy issue
[22:29:04] <sochotnicky> Yeah, I think for 99.9% of things I'd just need very simple repeats that can be supported in ical forma
[22:29:14] <sochotnicky> anyway - I do two-way sync
[22:29:22] <aindilis> cool
[22:29:26] <sochotnicky> but - todos currently do not support repeats at all
[22:29:59] <aindilis> yeah, it's insane
[22:30:07] <sochotnicky> and if you edit recurring event outside of org/org-caldav it kinda wipes the repeat on org side
[22:30:21] <aindilis> oh okay
[22:30:38] <aindilis> I tried to develop a task ontology to reify all the different distinctions with tasks
[22:30:50] <sochotnicky> for very basic one-off tasks it's more than fine (which is what I mostly use it for)
[22:31:46] <sochotnicky> basically I want something to quickly add a task and view my current events/tasks on my phone, but 90% of edits actually happen when I am at my computer
[22:36:32] <aindilis> https://github.com/aindilis/do-cyc/blob/main/do-cyc.subl
[22:37:07] <aindilis> This is a super primitive CycL ontology stub
[22:39:28] <aindilis> it can be easily converted to Prolog

[22:40:14] <aindilis> I kinda want to make the task management so feature complete that the system can manage it's own agenda without human intervention.

[22:45:19] <aindilis> I have terrible "executive function" and have been working 22 years to fix this problem, but am really no closer.
[22:50:21] <aindilis> I ought to give up.

[23:06:30] <corwin> This just let's me grab an org file from a browser automatically exporting to HTML (or PDF, or whatever) or execute babel blocks.  It doesn't have anything for updating org files, so far.
[23:07:12] <aindilis>  cool!
[23:07:25] <aindilis> how goes the "... sprawling probably org-mode zettelkasten for game management"?
[23:08:41] <corwin> fosshost has been eating my life last year or so, and now packaging Emacs for windows.  So, I haven't had much time to work on it, what with five kids and a day job :P
[23:08:48] <corwin> Thanks for asking!
[23:09:04] <aindilis> wow, that's amazing!  good job!
[23:10:24] <aindilis> I have a serious problem, on the one hand, it's easier to rely on the collective weight of everyone else's software (so I need to package it all),
[23:10:30] <aindilis> but on the other hand, I need specific solutions 1) to do that and 2) to scratch all my itches that I haven't found external software for.
[23:10:44] <corwin> highly relatable

[23:14:01] <aindilis> I guess I just have to buckle down and get Jason going.  I have 40 use cases for it (including packaging).  But I am loathe to program something "arbitrary."
