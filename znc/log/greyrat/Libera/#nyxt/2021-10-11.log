[12:38:38] <pjb> tekakutli: yeah, supermarkets are worse silos than Google!
[12:38:54] <pjb> They can only sell you fruits that transport and conserve well…
[12:44:41] <sirmacik> yup :<
[12:45:06] <sirmacik> this reminds me of that photo of oranges peeled and boxed in plastic box :D
[12:46:32] <sirmacik> can't find it right now :<

[12:58:50] <pjb> They discontinued them soon.  That could have been practical: peeling oranges sprays orange juice all over the place!  But the plastic is too gross…  it should be put to a better use.

[13:25:58] <sirmacik> I ave to say that I find it much more practical to cut orange in 4 and eat/suck it from the peel
[13:26:23] <sirmacik> no spraying and you can just enjoy your orange

[13:40:23] <ardon> Is it possible to use something resembling the WebRequest API to intercept network requests in Nyxt? I'd like to be able to open arbitrary pages in desktop programs without actually having to open the page and issue a keybinding to do so.
[13:41:27] <ardon> I'm aware I could potentially achieve this with hints, but I'd like to make it input independent

[21:34:13] <florhizome[m]> I saw webkit gtk is used for webapps (there are specific apps build with webkitgtk to host Webapps), so that would be a cool extension/functionality maybe? A Webapp manager... if you have configured your password manager already in nyxt that’s twice as useful. I liked that in opera where you could have a little sidebar with your webapps like whatsapp. (just icons)
[21:35:42] <edgarvincent[m]> florhizome: that would be very  useful
[21:36:58] <florhizome[m]> webapp–Mode
[21:40:06] <florhizome[m]> I don’t know anything about web apps, though^^ you might want to pass them an easy external  launch option when they are configured and create an entry in the desktop application folder.
[21:46:30] <florhizome[m]> ah i just checked what parenscript is. So that’s why @jmercouris said biwa–scheme is redundant in nyxt.
[21:49:02] <florhizome[m]> funnily enough I’m quite convinced in digging into guile more rn despite.^^
[21:50:04] <jmercouris> florhizome[m]: it's OK, we all make mistakes, even Guile :-P
[21:50:51] <jmercouris> florhizome[m]: Indeed, someone mentioned this idea of 'webapps' quite recently to us
[21:51:03] <jmercouris> I think it was an interesting idea, basically he wanted a hotkey to be able to launch any given app
[21:51:14] <jmercouris> and it to also be able to popout into a sort of standalone window
[21:51:22] <jmercouris> like for their slack chat or whatever
[22:04:20] <hendursaga> florhizome[m]: ParenScript isn't as hard to pick up as I thought
[22:04:28] <hendursaga> It's most that JavaScript sucks :P
