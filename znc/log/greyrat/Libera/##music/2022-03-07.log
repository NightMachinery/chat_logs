[19:07:27] <alex11> so i know this has likely been discussed ad nauseum but i am seeing a few positive comments wrt. epic's buying of bandcamp, namely that they tend to leave their acquisitions alone (even if the company itself is pretty rotten)
[19:07:46] <snake> louipc, i like it
[19:07:59] <alex11> i remain skeptical and sad, but hopefully bandcamp continues being good

[19:09:27] <louipc> bandcamp was nice but really a stopgap solution to indie music distribution in the grand scheme of things
[19:10:15] <louipc> anything that relies on central infrastructure is gonna get rekt

[22:08:46] <snake> wtf lol
[22:09:34] <artao> sometimes ya gotta have fun with your hair
[22:09:38] <efex_> I tried a beard on on side of my face for about 2 weeks once
[22:10:11] <efex_> not a long one, but it was there.. no one seeed to actually notice: that was of interest
[22:10:13] <SteppenwolfVM> i didn't cut or shave anything since a few years now
[22:10:25] <artao> another. i actually kept it this way for awhile. IIRC that's 3 yrs of beard
