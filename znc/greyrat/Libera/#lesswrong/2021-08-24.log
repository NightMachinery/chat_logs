[00:00:48] <gwern> no
[00:01:27] <ivan> gwern: do you know if any of the book scanning services are good enough for books containing photos?
[00:02:21] <ivan> oh hmm I could bet on openlibrary
[00:02:27] <gwern> ivan: like, high-quality photo photos, or just your usual 600dpi color scan? 1ds seems to work reasonably well for the latter
[00:02:38] <momus> (probably uses emacs)
[00:02:56] <momus> oh that's true, you do use evernote.
[00:02:57] <ivan> gwern: probably just the usual. thanks.
[00:03:28] <gwern> ivan: if you want to go with openlibrary, this is one I paid them to scan: https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780070340220
[00:03:29] <Robomot> The devil's DP dictionary : Kelly-Bootle, Stan : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive (xi, 141 pages : 20 cm)
[00:04:00] <ivan> gwern: do you know how long it was in the queue?
[00:04:56] <gwern> ivan: I paid on 21 june 2020, and I didn't see the result until jan 2021, although I don't know if that's because they didn't notify me or if it just took that long
[00:05:30] <ivan> Addeddate 2020-10-15 17:05:15
[00:05:41] <ivan> so 4 months
[00:06:38] <ivan> now it just needs to liberated to libgen :/
[00:07:15] <gwern> yeah. that's why I haven't used it since. it was expensive and I rather expected to be able to copy over to lg, but my drm stuff is broken
[00:07:24] <gwern> so I can't crack the adobe on IA or google play rn
[00:07:33] <gwern> back to scanning on 1ds
[00:08:02] <ivan> the JPEGs can be liberated from openlibrary using curl
[00:08:08] <ivan> but the cookie expires rapidly

[00:24:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, I see :(
[00:25:14] <ggreer> I think an email from a decade ago and... a woman who regretted a conversation with him a decade ago
[00:25:46] <ggreer> and de grey asked someone to make public some info that would exonerate him
[00:26:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ridiculous but not surprising at this point
[00:27:40] <gwern> why am I not surprised to see ggreer minimizing their profound emotional anguish at the comments and belittling their emotional labor in self-care for how de grey used them and instilled imposter syndrome while maintaining sexist structures of power?
[00:28:00] <ggreer> heh
[00:30:44] <Betawolf> He definitely should've waited for someone to make a public statement before sending that email.
[00:31:26] <kuudes> eh, that letter... he should have got an attorney, and no attorney would have ok'd sending that
[00:31:35] <saturn2> love to see structures of power not being maintained, which is totally what's going on here
[00:31:37] <kuudes> that can be read as basicly a threat
