[00:11:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the standard popular conception of America's wars in the ME is what? "We're bringing democracy", right?
[00:11:27] <saturn2> yeah
[00:11:46] * gwern realizes he has no idea what anton chekhov looks like
[00:12:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Well, that attitude is only possible if you think that everyone is basically alike, that everyone would prefer democracy if they could have it, and are only prevented from this by dictators; then we come in, overthrow the dictators, and the people say "oh thanks"; or (this is actually even worse) we first *teach* the people about democracy, and they go "oh of course! this is way better! thx!!"

[00:13:35] <gwern> 'I was taking pictures in the back and overheard one of the employees say to the manager, “Well, we can’t INTERRUPT him.”' <-- certainly not! chekhov was one of the greatest writers in history
[00:13:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: So that's "mistake theory" (though I think the idea is still fundamentally a wrong one, but that's the same attitude being pointed to by many of the people who talk about it)
[00:14:14] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: that seems pretty quokka-like (with a small exception for people they identify as an "evil dictator")
[00:14:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't it a massive distortion of "quokka" to describe, like, American intelligence community people, as quokkas
[00:15:06] <gwern> 'It took only a few moments of looking around with a stunned and confused look upon my face before a woman sitting in the row in front of me engaged me in conversation. She said she was “shocked” and “outraged” at how Barnes & Nobles would kick out an author who was trying to give a reading. She even walked up to a security guard who informed her that “Chekov” was not scheduled to...
[00:15:12] <gwern> ...read at the store. Offering my desire for “a souvenir” as reasoning, I excused myself for a moment to pick up one of the Chekov posters just in case the mission was going to be repeated in the Chelsea B&N. At one point she thought out loud that perhaps he wasn’t the real Chekov, but quickly dismissed the thought and returned to being furious with Barnes & Noble about how they treat...
[00:15:18] <gwern> ...respected playwrights. The woman asked me if I knew anything about Chekov and when I feigned ignorance she continued to tell me that he was a great playwright with many famous works and that she was currently in rehearsals for another Chekov play, “The Seagull,” and considered herself lucky to happen upon a chance reading by the author.'

[00:18:09] <gwern> 'He then pulled out his cell phone and made a call to a friend.

That’s funny.” “Yeah,...
[00:18:15] <gwern> ...that’s weird, well I think it was, I don’t know” “19th Century you think?” “I don’t know, this is weird.” “Well, he’s here.” “No, it’s definitely him, It must have been the 1960’s” “It only sounds old because it’s Russian”'

[00:48:27] <ggreer> also you don't have to make such wide tunnels. apparently the main cost is tunnel diameter
[00:49:39] <gwern> makes sense. area squared, then multiplied by length...
[00:49:41] <rmmh> the trips/hour is rather pathetic

[02:04:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is interesting to put this in contrast with Objectivists. As far as I know, smoking was considered rational and high-status among them.
[02:04:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> That might suggest that even in organizations that try to be rational, the instinct to copy high-status people is too strong, and members rationalize copying the personal quirks of the leaders as “doing the rational thing”. We need a rationality movement started by a heavy drinker who also happens to be a furry, and see what their followers will consider the most rational way of life."

You treat everybody with politeness and pleasantness, making life run smoothly and productively, helping people accomplish what they think they want even though you know that it is all "vanity and striving after wind". Your entire life starts to feel like working as a hospice nurse. Everyone around you is
[02:32:14] <Obormot\Arcturus>  suffering from a fatal condition that's impossible for you to cure, so all you can do is make things temporarily more pleasant for them. You have to learn to let go of any idea that the world can or should be any different than it is, or that it's actually possible to fix or cure them in any way."

The norms, which were designed in the 1990s to estimate the impact of
[04:37:42] <feepbot> socioeconomic factors on a person’s health, relied on a fraught set of assumptions to make connections between race and a person’s cognitive skills.

[05:07:35] <[itchyjunk]> oh right
[05:07:44] <[itchyjunk]> ah okay, that makes sense 
[05:08:12] <[itchyjunk]> like guessing that petal thing, random guessing would give me 33%
[05:09:19] <[itchyjunk]> the model was to predict something along the lines of "if this patient catches covid, how likely are they to develop complications". something about trying to figure out the high risk population already
[05:09:47] <[itchyjunk]> from what i understood from their slides, people who spend $100k in medical bills were the most likely to develop this complication
[05:10:27] <gwern> that sounds perilously like leakage
[05:11:19] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[05:12:24] <[itchyjunk]> ah, they shouldn't have used the bills in their training or somesuch?
[05:12:53] <gwern> yes
[05:13:56] <[itchyjunk]> apparently the hospital network had data analyst but using machine learning is a fairly new thing they are doing and some of the data had to be converted from paper format to digital format
[05:14:05] <[itchyjunk]> maybe they used everything available

[06:20:01] <[itchyjunk]> better than turning the fat color of a cow about to die from yellow to white
[06:25:01] <feepbot> <gwern> 'You may be surprised to learn that AI voices are starting to sound resoundingly human. Take a look at Faith, the AI voice over that went viral in 2020 as “the first AI that can cry.” Faith is incredibly emotional, realistic, and it’s hard to tell that it’s a synthetic voice. So can synthetic voices hold their own against real voices? The answer is gradually
[06:25:01] <feepbot> becoming a yes. AI and synthetic voices are most effective with short-form content. Longer content tends to require more work and management. It seems it’s not a matter of if synthetic voices are going to fulfill voice over jobs, but when. In the AI character voices experiment, Voice123 found that 8.6% of clients said that our AI voices were hireable.'

[07:11:12] <PlanckWalk> Ah okay, the Dualtron does
[07:12:33] <PlanckWalk> 8.3kW, so they could (in theory at least) lift a 100 kg person vertically at a speed of 8 m/s (19 mph)
[07:13:55] <PlanckWalk> I guess reduce that for the weight of the scooter (66 kg)
[07:16:10] <gwern> better lose weight, fatso

[07:17:31] <adiabatic> gwern: I haven't weighed 220 pounds for years
[07:18:10] <gwern> what a suspiciously specific denial. so you weigh 230 now?
[07:19:02] <PlanckWalk> So I guess 5 m/s vertically.  It looks like the steepest streets are on the order of 35% grade, so the maximum horizontal speed could be ~14 m/s (32 mph)
[07:19:22] <saturn2> "i haven't weighed 220 pounds for years - the years between ages 0 and 15"
[07:19:54] <PlanckWalk> "I haven't weighed 220 pounds for years, only the past few months"
[07:20:37] <gwern> "I haven't weighed 220 pounds for years, due to my long-term mars mission. Oh, did you mean *mass*?"
[07:21:13] <rmmh> "I haven't weighed 220 pounds for years; I weigh much more than that"
[07:21:15] <adiabatic> I went over 220 sometime in high school and dropped below it at the tail end of high school. Went back up over it when I was mega crippled and now I'm still too damn fat at 200.
[07:21:39] <adiabatic> Topped out at 245. 220 is merely a nice round number for fatsos, especially for foreigners.
[07:22:12] <adiabatic> I mean, I don't know how to do all this math in pounds and slugs and whatever else.
[07:22:12] <rmmh> go up 5 more pounds for a nice even lmao1plaet

[13:38:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Obvious question for the writer of the letter he quotes: why not suicide
[13:40:09] <Filipepe> he has said this harms the people left behind, among other reasons
[13:40:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, doesn't that seem like a sensible response and position? "Yes, sometimes life is suffering. In such cases, kill yourself! But most lives aren't like that, so having kids is perfectly fine."
[13:40:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Filipepe: Come now, that's a weak argument. Yes it harms the people left behind, but surely less than torturing the poor guy/gal!
[13:41:13] <LeoTal1> Note that your life might be worse than never being born, but better than death; that childhood sucks and suffering is much more curable in adulthood, so if you survive it you may end up wanting to live but regretting not committing suicide earlier; that suicide is really scary and hard.
[13:41:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah, I don't buy that
[13:42:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not nearly scary and hard enough to justify not doing it in a case like the described one
[13:42:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I don't buy the last option, that is, nor the first, for that matter)
[13:42:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The second one - regretting not committing suicide earlier - is ... not a priori impossible, but seems extremely unlikely to me)
[13:43:30] <LeoTal1> He says his main current problem is *fear* of death, which, uh, kind of a strange problem — "terrible food, portions too small"
[13:43:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's much more likely to feel like you would have committed suicide if you'd known what was ahead, but no longer wanting to (or wanting to have done it)

[13:47:29] <LeoTal1> Like I have this picture: "oh fuck I'm gonna be tortured daily until I'm 18 (realistically, even older, because I need job skills to get out), I should kill myself" "come on, stick it out! adulthood will be good enough that it's worth waiting it out!" "yeah ok" a few decades later "welp I stuck it out, and now life's good, but it definitely wasn't worth the wait. I shoulda killed myself the first time I thought of it". What scenario a

[13:50:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Kill yourself
[13:51:02] <capisce> sounds extreme
[13:51:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fair enough, maybe just deal with it and hope your life becomes worth living later
[13:51:31] <LeoTal> "which I have good reasons to believe, and am not just having distorted cognition due to depression, etc" I agree with that but that doesn't apply to OP, does it? Their main problem is fear of death! They want to be alive but they can't enjoy that time because they know it's sharply finite

[13:54:40] <capisce> programming
[13:55:15] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: This person strikes me as being a dumbass on purpose. People (and, like, machines) are capable of regretting their choices. This can be useful if similar choices are presented, or to provide advice to others (e.g. on "hey, WIBTA if I had kids?"). But even if the regret is useless, it's possible to think about the counterfactual! You don't have to go "la la la hypothetical questions are irrelevant and meaningless"

"Hell no they'll spend their whole childhoods wanting to die." Second the meaninglessness: I get that you don't like the question, but it's absolutely well defined.

[14:07:13] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: Hm? You know what happened (you got decades of suffering). You know what would have happened otherwise (you'd have died, end of story). So you have all the information to compare the two outcomes.

Again, the actual is much worse than the ideal." ... agreed, so stop having children until we perfect the world. But wait, we need technological and

[14:11:11] <rsaarelm> Also I don't really have a good picture of "thriving in a programming job" life path to aspire to. Most people I know in programming are in various stages of cynical and burned out.

[14:15:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: "training genius" is mostly impossible, child murder is a bad idea on net (for various moral and non-moral reasons), but eugenics is of course the way to go - embryo selection and all that
[14:15:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: Anyway, the view I'm describing is just Benatar + longtermism
[14:15:36] <PapuaHardyNet> also marry a woman/man who is philosophically similar to you or you'll get fucked spectacularly
[14:15:38] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: Wtf do you mean by "meaningless"? My assumption was "ill-posed" but you just agreed it isn't; another reasonable meaning could be "useless to inform any choices" but it's certainly useful for advising others
[14:16:07] <capisce> a bit hard to calculate how much I need since my ideal life style is a moving target
[14:16:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: It doesn't have any consequences even in principle
[14:16:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I disagree on "useful for advising others")
[14:16:28] <capisce> it involves affording to stay in a warm and sunny place during winter
[14:16:45] <capisce> and that depends a lot on various countries' visa policies etc
[14:16:54] <rsaarelm> Don't a lot of those have pretty low cost of living?

[14:17:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "A show might not be bad enough to leave, but would you have come at all if you knew how bad it would be?" ... someone needs to tell Benatar about sunk cost bias

[14:19:04] <PapuaHardyNet> capisce: take multiple scenarios of your lifestyles - you have a finite permutations of lifestyles to calculate for
[14:19:10] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: The argument it's not useful advice is "how do you know"? I agree that one person isn't super useful but it's useful when polling a large sample
[14:19:49] <rsaarelm> capisce: Do you have some open source work, independent research ambitions or something you might do if you had enough FIRE engine for living expenses so you didn't need to go to work?
[14:19:51] <capisce> PapuaHardyNet: yep... also if I end up aiming too low I guess I could go back to work or consulting for a period of time
[14:20:16] <capisce> rsaarelm: I don't have any really ambitious projects, but I also don't have any problem occupying my time without work
[14:20:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: Perhaps, but we've strayed rather far afield from the original question(s) if we're going to "polling large samples" (and, presumably, figuring out what the appropriate reference class is, how similar the advisee is to the modal member of the polled population, etc., etc.)
[14:20:46] <capisce> I'd probably invest more time in learning Chinese etc
[14:21:17] <capisce> there are many things that interest me, but I wouldn't necessarily want to have a job involving them
[14:22:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah Benatar's "performance not bad enough to leave" argument is just dumb
[14:22:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I've totally walked right out of a movie, by the way)
[14:22:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Went to see one of the Hulk movies, I forget which one. Walked in, watched a couple of minutes, walked right out)
[14:23:25] <PapuaHardyNet> Benetar probably means that on average people's lives aren't worth suicide, although some people can and should kill themselves
[14:24:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, yes, but his point is that it's possible, and not only possible but *pretty much universal*, for people's lives to be not worth living, but also not so bad as to be worth killing oneself
[14:24:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is a stupid argument
[14:24:22] <PapuaHardyNet> agreed
[14:24:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Perhaps Benatar should just be advocating for easier suicide methods
[14:24:54] <PapuaHardyNet> Benetar should be giving out fentanyl to suicidal people - gotta have skin in the game, right?
[14:25:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Get that activation (or ... deactivation) energy low enough, and we'd see his theory tested well and proper
[14:25:13] <nshepperd2> suicide booths on every street corner, right next to the gene hacking clinics
[14:25:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Set up some suicide booths, like in "The King in Yellow"
[14:25:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[14:25:56] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: An extremely common situation: "Hey I'm 16 and I want to fucking die". I say "Hang in there! You still have a few years of torture to endure, but then it gets amazingly better". You say… "I have no advice to give"?
[14:26:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The difference between a life not worth starting and a life not worth continuing partly explains why anti-natalism does not imply either suicide or murder. It can be the case that one’s life was not worth starting _without_ it being the case that one’s life is not worth continuing. If the quality of one’s life is still not bad enough to override one’s interest in not dying, then one’s life is still worth continuing,
[14:26:46] <Obormot\Arcturus>  even though the current and future harms are sufficient to make it the case that one’s life was not worth starting. Moreover, because death is bad, even when it ceases to be bad all-things-considered, it is a consideration against procreation – as well as against murder and suicide." ... talk about motivated cognition
[14:26:56] <LeoTal> My objection to easy suicide is that most suicidal people are responding to pain in the moment, not integrating over future quality of life (either failing to think of it at all, or underestimating it because that's what depression does)
[14:27:40] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, people should do some proof of work before they are allowed to commit suicide
[14:28:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: I mean, I'd say the same thing as you (in the hypothetical scenario where I somehow knew this to be the case, which is unrealistic, so actually I'd say "don't listen to that guy, he's talking out of his ass, he has absolutely no idea what your future holds or how bad or good it will be or when or for how long")

[14:29:35] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: I feel like you have some sort of objection to looking at typical life trajectories and using them to make individual decisions
[14:29:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: As for the suicide booths, well, if I were inclined to make that a realistic proposal instead of a casual comment, I'd say something like "mandate some test to determine whether the person is making a realistic estimate of future life quality" - more generally, obviously there's a lot of thinking to do before having anything implementable

[14:30:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: My objection is that you can't look at typical life trajectories and use them to make individual decisions
[14:30:30] <PapuaHardyNet> capisce: hell yes :3, but what would count as work? Helping other people commit suicide? Or helping other people in general?
[14:30:44] <capisce> sounds like a pyramid scheme
[14:30:48] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd say "helping other people commit suicide" would not be a good incentive
[14:31:01] <PapuaHardyNet> helping other people in general sounds like a very, very good proof of work
[14:31:17] <capisce> but helping others makes you feel good, so then maybe you don't want to commit suicide any more
[14:31:22] <PapuaHardyNet> if I have helped my friends go through hell and back, and have decided that I need to off myself, fuck it, I should be able to off myself
[14:31:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, it'd be Goodharted immediately, and a vague desideratum like that is extremely easy to Goodhart
[14:31:28] <PapuaHardyNet> capisce: that's the point!
[14:31:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Consequently it's a terrible proof of work
[14:31:32] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: That's out-there enough that I don't know which step we disagree on! To me it seems like a special case of, like, "statistics works"
[14:31:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> They don't, though
[14:32:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> (They only work statistically)
[14:32:34] <PapuaHardyNet> Obormot: well, true. It will be goodharted. Unfortunate. But I am curious whether a goodhart resistant method could exist. Perhaps one that doesn't rely on explicit measurements
[14:32:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's even easier
[14:32:57] <capisce> when I was down with the flu and a heavy fever a couple of weeks back I was thinking I'd rather die than continue endure another moment of that
[14:33:03] <LeoTal> Congratulations on being even weirder than Mr "we should kill the entire biosphere"
[14:33:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> If it doesn't rely on explicit measurements then it must require human judgment
[14:33:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> And human judgment can be subverted
[14:33:14] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps suicidechain's nodes (not miners) are simply people who validate a person's work

[14:33:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: Thanks but I don't think my view is all that weird
[14:33:48] <PapuaHardyNet> :< so we cannot have a decentralized suicide support
[14:34:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: We just have to find some clever hack
[14:34:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who will be the Satoshi Nakamoto of suicide??
[14:34:30] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: I would like you to explain it but I kinda get the vibe that you enjoy making it as hard as possible to figure out your views
[14:34:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: I don't :(
[14:36:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: All I'm saying is, anyone even asking questions like this is already unusual. The more you try to figure out anything in this domain about your own life, the more unusual you are. You (the hypothetical person asking, or being asked, any of these questions) are at the tails of *multiple* distributions. And you want to look at statistics, and derive from those statistics predictions about your own future life that are
[14:36:51] <Obormot\Arcturus>  certain enough to decide whether to *end* your life? That is an utter fool's errand
[14:37:39] <LeoTal> Like this whole conversation has been: I state a point, you say "no", I state my argument for the point, you say which part you disagree with, repeat until I find out that your argument against my original "childhood sucks" was "Francis Galton was a witch"
[14:37:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> For example
[14:38:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have never, at any point in my life, been in a position such that if someone asked me "what is your life going to be five years from now", I'd've been able to give an accurate answer
[14:38:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> *Never*.
[14:38:31] <LeoTal> This might not be the most important disagreement here, but I wish to register astonishment at "anyone even asking questions like this is already unusual"
[14:38:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe you don't interact with normal people enough
[14:38:56] <LeoTal> Praise the Lord
[14:39:12] <Gurkenglas> Improvising D&D theology. The lawful outer planes have positive curvature, the chaotic outer planes negative, the remainder zero. Thus Heaven, Axis and Hell are finite; Nirvana and Abaddon are infinite in the usual manner; Elysium, Maelstrom and Abyss are infinite in an exponential manner, such that you can get lost ludicrously in a short time. The Abyss is contracting; the constant overpopulation therefore 
[14:39:12] <Gurkenglas> converges to demons killing one another as fast as their density is forced up. Elysium is expanding; it therefore converges to animals breeding in a permanent state of r-selection. Abaddon is empty, so souls that go there can only survive by eating other souls that go there.
[14:39:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: Yes, agreed, but the consequence of this fact is your astonishment at what seems to me to be an obvious point
[14:40:22] <rsaarelm> Gurkenglas: Nice.
[14:40:36] <capisce> don't most life satisfaction by age curves show that it keeps dropping from childhood all the way until close to retirement age?
[14:40:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> For the record, I think that Francis Galton was probably not a witch (but one might've forgiven Puritans of earlier eras for being inclined to burn him, were he to show up in their milieu ... he was pretty exceptional, almost magically so, after all)
[14:41:25] <rsaarelm> Gurkenglas: So what kind of graph paper should I use when the players get in fights on the different planes?
[14:41:33] <capisce> though it seems strange that life satisfaction is higher in high school than in university on average
[14:41:35] <rsaarelm> Or for the dungeon maps.
[14:41:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> capisce: My point exactly; if that's true, then that's a strong argument against reasoning from statistics to life outcomes for people to whom our discussion applies, because, by construction, such people have terrible childhoods but more satisfying adulthoods
[14:41:50] <capisce> but maybe I'm not neurotypical enough
[14:42:02] <Gurkenglas> rsaarelm, google images of hyperrogue
[14:42:14] <rsaarelm> Having to take the class of non-Euclidean geometry of your current plane into account when you do dungeon cartography would be a fun way to mess with players.

[14:42:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Not bad, not bad
[14:42:48] <capisce> "According to 6 surveys recently conducted on life satisfaction around the globe, responses plotted by age show that, generally, people report high degrees of happiness in their late teens and early 20s. But as the years roll by, people become more and more miserable, hitting a nadir in life satisfaction sometime around the early 50s. Good news is that happiness rebounds from there into retirement."
[14:43:34] <capisce> seems like happiness is negatively correlated with work
[14:43:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas, rsaarelm: However, note that canonically, (at least some of) the extraplanar realms are infinite but bounded in three-dimensional space specifically because they have extension in a fourth spatial dimension
[14:43:52] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: Like, this scenario happens to me *all the time*: <young'un> "Yo I'm [14 to 20] living with abusive parents, I have crippling suicidal depression" <everyone over 25> "Yeah you and everyone else. Your life will continue not to be worth living until 1) you move out 2) you get meds/therapy 3) you have enough money not to be dependent on your abusers. That should only take a few years so hang in there, it gets better aft
[14:43:52] <LeoTal> er that."
[14:44:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas, rsaarelm: e.g. there's explicit reference in the sourcebooks to traveling in the ana and cata directions on Elemental planes
[14:44:12] <rsaarelm> I don't have kids and I think I pretty much torched my career so as long as I don't end up homeless I should be doing good on the middle age happiness thing.
[14:45:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: Right, except that the "and everyone else" is wrong, and also "it gets better after that" is often wrong
[14:45:57] <LeoTal> Gurkenglas: Wait, what happens to a soul that starves or gets eaten? Is there an afterafterlife?
[14:45:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: My experience is that I can look back on my own life and imagine all sorts of counterfactuals, and all of them are completely worthless for advising anyone else, because life is unpredictable and can go anywhere
[14:46:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: It's the Lower Planes, so the default answer's gonna be "eternity of suffering"
[14:46:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just, on general principle
[14:46:51] <Gurkenglas> It's mostly consensus that you cease to exist among theologists, as far as my character would say.
[14:47:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, those optimistic theologists
[14:47:20] <Gurkenglas> Though who knows - perhaps when Asmodeus has conquered all he will find a way to reach arbitrarily far back in time and give everyone their due.
[14:47:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe devoured souls feeds Asmodeus and hasten his rise
[14:47:46] <Gurkenglas> He's certainly incentivized to do so, and Asmodeus is the god of incentives.
[14:47:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is the 5e cosmology you're using for a basis, right?)
[14:47:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or is this PF)
[14:47:52] <Gurkenglas> PF
[14:47:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm, yeah
[14:48:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> PF version of Asmodeus is kind of unsatisfactory imo
[14:48:11] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: "and everyone else" is of course not literal, it means "you are a highly typical sample of a well-known phenomenon"; "it gets better after that" has occasionally proven wrong (inability to take off in the first place; consequences of trauma not fixed enough by meds+therapy; falling into a bad crowd) but it makes the expected value of survival definitely positive, though you don't believe in expected values so I don't
[14:48:11] <LeoTal>  know where that leaves us
[14:48:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> I believe in expected values, who says I don't
[14:48:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, you mean expected values of subjective probability distributions
[14:49:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I guess you could say I don't believe in those. I dunno, that's not quite right, but sure ok
[14:50:33] <Gurkenglas> All the lawful gods hope to overcome that pesky finite time limitation in the limit of time. Nirvana has more of an ultrafinitarian view: Who cares about the distant future? Souls should heal now.
[14:50:43] <Gurkenglas> *pesky linear time
[14:50:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> *ultrafinitist
[14:51:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man, this is just reminding me of how much I resent PF's simplification of the Great Wheel
[14:51:54] <Gurkenglas> Axis is going straight for technological victory; if the plot continues as it has with nobody winning against anyone else, it'll be *them* that unlock time travel first.
[14:54:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> The obvious way to achieve time travel is to thwart the PCs in Iron Gods, allowing Unity to ascend
[14:54:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> A superintelligence like that will surely invent time travel easily

Hell is a pyramid scheme and reinvests all power it gains in the material plane to grow; they're banking on the hope that as long as there's three people left alive, someone is gonna want someone dead.

[15:08:31] <Gurkenglas> Nirvana is also empty, but souls there heal over time instead of starving.

[15:10:17] <LeoTal> Gurkenglas: What happens when you die/otherwise enter those planes? Are you deposited at a special centre point, or a random point in the plane, or what?
[15:14:05] <Gurkenglas> LeoTal, two people with spacetimedistance x on the same time that both shift to another plane will end up no further than c*x from one another for some constant c.
[15:14:17] <Gurkenglas> -same time+same plane
[15:15:15] <LeoTal> Gurkenglas: c is constant wrt time? Or expanding along with the plane?

[17:49:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do not see this problem
[17:49:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Works fine
[17:51:34] <gwern> wow, this is so weird. there's some sort of multi-scroll problem going on here... mouse-wheel scroll (and Space?) acts totally differently from PgUp/PgDwn, and it's also stateful, so if I scroll with mouse wheel, it 'unlocks' the rest of the page for PgUp/Dwn...?
[17:51:57] <gwern> https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16348260051794887.png look at this, there's *two* scrollbars if you look closely

[17:52:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: In fact if you just click on the page it will also unlock it for PgUp/PgDn
[17:52:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> The two scrollbars, though, I don't see that either
[17:52:48] <gwern> why would I ever click on a page while I'm still reading it with PgUp/Dn? not good enough and also has practically no links/references anyway
[17:53:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm not suggesting that you would, I'm just noting the behavior
[17:54:01] <gwern> let's see... it's not ublock, disabling it makes no difference. but you're right, a single left click does 'unlock' it, although I also see no visual difference in the scrollbars so no hint of what's going on there
[17:54:25] <PapuaHardyNet> so is there an invisible clickable element overlaying the page?

[17:55:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's the same issue Gurkenglas was having the other day on that obscure web forum or w/e it was
[17:55:26] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm not finding any such issues: Firefox + ublock origin
[17:56:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> The <body> is the size of the viewport, and then there's a contained element which is the actual scrollable content container
[17:57:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> So when AKS does its restore-scrollability thing, it causes the body to be focused, and this is bad because scrolling the body does nothing (because it's no taller than the viewport)
[17:57:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Clicking or scroll-wheel-using within the content area switches the focus
[17:57:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I have no idea what the other issues gwern has are about
[17:57:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm not seeing those

[18:48:14] <Obormot\Gaia> So, Orion (son of Alveric and the titular elven princess) has grown up somewhat, he's a young man and at this point quite a skilled hunter. Also he's inherited some subtle magic from his mother, and so, one day, he's out in the forest with his carefully assembled and trained team of hunting hounds when he sees - a unicorn!
[18:48:46] <Obormot\Gaia> How does Orion respond to this? That's right: he decides to hunt and kill said unicorn
[18:49:31] <gwern> fucking pedophile rapists
[18:49:40] <gwern> good for the prince
[18:49:48] <Obormot\Gaia> So we have this extended scene of Orion and his dogs chasing this unicorn through the lands of men, tracking it, running it down
[18:49:49] <PapuaHardyNet> wait what
[18:50:09] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: why do you think they're so horny for young virgin girls
[18:50:26] <gwern> it's a brave volunteer who will let herself be used for bait
[18:50:58] <PapuaHardyNet> oh I see, I didn't know till now that unicorns are commonly known to only appear to young virgin girls
[18:50:58] <Obormot\Gaia> Finally the unicorn tires out, stops running; for some reason Orion decides it would be unsporting to just shoot it with his bow, so he takes out his sword and tries to stab it for a while, but the unicorn turns out to be able to fence with its horn and holds Orion at bay
[18:51:00] <gwern> and there is no chris hansen in the middle ages
[18:51:14] <Obormot\Gaia> Briefly it looks like the unicorn might get the better of Orion!
[18:51:30] <Obormot\Gaia> But nope, his dogs attack it and kill it

[18:52:09] <Obormot\Gaia> Of course the thing to do at this point is to cut off the unicorn's head for a trophy, which Orion does, while fending off the hounds, who just want to drink the beast's blood
[18:52:35] <gwern> what's wrong with that?
[18:52:39] <gwern> they worked hard for their kill
[18:52:44] <Obormot\Gaia> Finally he's got the unicorn's head and takes it back to the castle
[18:52:58] <Obormot\Gaia> And at this point Dunsany goes on an extended digression
[18:53:34] <Obormot\Gaia> WHich... I really must quote
[18:53:40] *** Joins: two2thehead (~user@124.195.204.230)
[18:54:23] <Obormot\Gaia> “This was the horn that was sent in later years as a gift from the Pope to King Francis. Benvenuto Cellini tells of it in his memoirs. He tells how Pope Clement sent for him and a certain Tobbia, and ordered them to make designs for the setting of a unicorn’s horn, the finest ever seen. Judge then of Orion’s delight when the horn of the first unicorn he ever took was such as to be esteemed generations later the finest
[18:54:23] <Obormot\Gaia>  ever seen, and in no less a city than Rome, with all her opportunities to acquire and compare such things. For a number of these curious horns must have been available for the Pope to have selected for the gift the finest ever seen; but in the simpler days of my story the rarity of the horn was so great that unicorns were still considered fabulous. The year of the gift to King Francis would be about 1530, the horn being
[18:54:23] <Obormot\Gaia>  mounted in gold; and the contract went to Tobbia and not to Benvenuto Cellini.”
[18:54:57] <Obormot\Gaia> “I mention the date because there are those who care little for a tale if it be not here and there supported by history, and who even in history care more for fact than philosophy. If any such reader have followed the fortunes of Orion so far he will be hungry by now for a date or a historical fact. As for the date, I give him 1530.”
[18:55:17] <Obormot\Gaia> “While for the historical fact I select that generous gift recorded by Benvenuto Cellini, because it may well be that just where he came to unicorns such a reader may have felt furthest away from history and have felt loneliest just at this point for want of historical things. How the unicorn’s horn found its way from the Castle of Erl, and in what hands it wandered, and how it came at last to the City of Rome, would of
[18:55:18] <Obormot\Gaia>  course make another book.”

[18:57:12] <Obormot\Gaia> "Deemed "the most unfortunate of the popes", Clement VII's reign was marked by a rapid succession of political, military, and religious struggles—many long in the making—which had far-reaching consequences for Christianity and world politics.[4]"

[19:01:15] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway, note, there is no historical reference at all in this story until this point
[19:01:42] <Obormot\Gaia> No indication of where or when it takes place, no familiar place names, no references at all that would even indicate that it's our world!
[19:02:05] <Obormot\Gaia> But then, bam: it's in 1530, this is the unicorn horn given to the Pope, etc.
[19:02:09] <Obormot\Gaia> Out of absolutely nowhere
[19:02:56] <Obormot\Gaia> Oh, except the preface, which in its entirety is as follows:
[19:03:01] <Obormot\Gaia> “I hope that no suggestion of any strange land that may be conveyed by the title will scare readers away from this book; for, though some chapters do indeed tell of Elfland, in the greater part of them there is no more to be shown than the face of the fields we know, and ordinary English woods and a common village and valley, a good twenty or twenty-five miles from the border of Elfland.”
[19:03:34] <Obormot\Gaia> One gets the distinct sense that Dunsany is mocking certain of his readers
[19:05:14] <mst> guided google translate is surprisingly effective provided you know enough of the lagnauge to be able to tweak the input until it does what you want
[19:05:49] <gwern> Obormot\Gaia: man, screw him, I want a map and detailed chronology and no backtalk!
[19:07:14] <Obormot\Gaia> Oh yes, and before this there's also a great scene where... so the events of the book start because the people of this land are like "man, our lives are boring, our kingdom isn't famous at all, you know what we need? we need our king to be a magic king instead of a boring regular king"
[19:07:48] <Obormot\Gaia> So they go to the existing king and are like "we want a magic lord to rule us" and he's like "ok sure" and he sends his son to Elfland to retrieve the King of Elfland's daughter and marry her, etc.
[19:08:05] <gwern> sounds like it worked out for them. they got cool unicorns, a beautiful elven princess, a badass half-elven (always the best kind of elven) prince...
[19:08:18] <gwern> I believe at this point he even has not one but *two* swords
[19:08:53] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway, so later in the story, right, Alveric has brought back the princess, had a son, then the princess ran off back to Elfland, Alveric went off after her, and the son is ... questionably magical but mostly mundane
[19:09:22] <Obormot\Gaia> So the people meet in council again and are like "man this sucks, we still don't have a magic lord"
[19:09:24] <PapuaHardyNet> Is Alveric the king or his kid
[19:09:38] <Obormot\Gaia> Alveric is the initial protagonist, who goes to Elfland
[19:09:53] <PapuaHardyNet> so the OG king's kig
[19:10:04] <LeoTal> Reminds me of 1) my crushing disappointment that _Going Postal_ refused to turn into a debugging-thriller over the workings of the clacks 2) my strenuous disagreement with the first example in _How Not to Write a Novel_, calling a conflict about type of sink drain joints "too slight"
[19:10:09] <Obormot\Gaia> Anyway, THEN someone mentions that a unicorn was spotted recently! That's magic, right??
[19:10:21] <Obormot\Gaia> And someone else is like "what, nah, sounds like fake news"
[19:10:26] <Obormot\Gaia> And they argue about it for a while
[19:10:32] <PapuaHardyNet> hilarious
[19:10:51] <Obormot\Gaia> Then someone's like "ok ok we have to settle this argument already. we have to settle it with facts."
[19:10:55] <Obormot\Gaia> "Let's vote on it."
[19:11:05] <Obormot\Gaia> So they *vote* on whether there is, or is not, in fact a unicorn
[19:11:24] <Obormot\Gaia> The vote comes out nay
[19:11:37] <Obormot\Gaia> And they're like "oh looks like there's no unicorn after all, bummer."
[19:12:32] <Obormot\Gaia> (At no point in this process do any of them leave the house of the one dude they're hanging out at, drinking mead)
[19:12:47] <gwern> (and then the prince comes in with the head, but nevertheless, The Voice Of the People Shall Not Be Gainsaid By Foreign Tyrants)
[19:12:52] <Obormot\Gaia> Haha
[19:13:05] <LeoTal> I agree that this is dumb as shit but it's certainly realistic
[19:13:06] <gwern> (it is clearly some sort of cow or beached narwhal head)
[19:13:48] <Obormot\Gaia> Right, he comes back with the head, and:
[19:13:52] <Obormot\Gaia> “So that the parliament of Erl met again in the forge of Narl. They sat at the table there debating the rumour; and others besides Threl had seen the head. And at first, for the sake of old divisions, some held to their opinion that there had been no unicorn. They drank Narl’s goodly mead and argued against the monster. But after a while, whether Threl’s argument convinced them, or whether as is more likely, they yielded
[19:13:53] <Obormot\Gaia>  from generosity, which arose like a beautiful flower out of the mellow mead, whatever it was the debate of those that opposed the unicorn languished, and when the vote was put it was declared that Orion had killed a unicorn, which he had hunted hither from beyond the fields we know.”

[22:31:28] <adiabatic> that said, most pageup/pagedown I do is in-browser, and that's always space/shift-space
[22:31:50] <galambo> I just use the touchpad
[22:32:16] <adiabatic> and touchpads on Macs are fantastic (conversely, touchpads everywhere else suck ass)
[22:42:04] <galambo> I predict macs will keep pulling ahead more and more from PCs
[22:43:14] <galambo> I think it will turn out to be a situation similar to iphones vs android. where the apple product is much faster but more locked down
[22:46:52] <adiabatic> eh, wait for world+dog's antitrust division to come down on Apple like a sack of bricks
[22:47:18] <galambo> apple is already beating android in perfomance by a wide margin. people dont even realise it
[22:48:00] <galambo> mind you I have an eink phone which is abysmally slow as a phone
[22:51:45] <spxtr> it bothers me that my 3 year old pixel 2 xl is no longer supported
[22:52:03] <galambo> spxtr, I also own a pixel 2
[22:52:16] <spxtr> it still works great, the battery lasts all day, it's fast enough for everything I do
[22:53:51] <galambo> spxtr, pixel 2 is an underrated phone. I still use my pixel 1 for free full res google photos uploads
[22:54:07] <galambo> and some misc things I cannot do on my eink phone
[22:54:41] <LeoTal> Windows is intolerable; free Unices (Linux, BSD) mean more maintenance work than I'm willing to put in; therefore I run OSX
[22:55:30] <galambo> LeoTal, what makes windows intolerable? I have always used windows. I tried linux briefly and it was a bit daunting to get used to a whole new OS. I never used macos. what am I missing out on?
[22:55:38] <spxtr> I enjoy the tweaking/maintenance of the free unixes.
[22:55:52] <spxtr> galambo: are you a programmer?
[22:55:55] <galambo> no
[22:56:15] <galambo> but doesnt windows have a linux subsystem?
[22:56:41] <spxtr> it does, but it's generally a hassle to use
[22:56:49] <feep> and why wouldn't it be
[22:57:03] <galambo> so if I am not a programmer, there would be no advantage to using linux or macos?
[22:57:12] <feep> uuh
[22:57:27] <feep> it depends on your tolerance of various design tradeoffs
[22:57:34] <spxtr> probably don't use linux. mac people like macos more because it's pretty or something silly like that
[22:57:37] <galambo> can you give an example?
[22:57:49] <feep> well, I haven't used windows in ages, and I am a programmer
[22:57:57] <LeoTal> galambo: Has all the mysterious failures I've endured on Linux; extremely fussy, constantly interrupting you with focus-stealing prompts for things that could wait; doesn't give you control (there's *ads* on it now, for fuck's sake!) and is increasingly full of spyware; poor compatibility with various standards (this one isn't super relevant if you're not a programmer or at least a power user)
[22:58:22] <feep> but mostly it's that linux, well, kde which I like, tends to be pretty unopinionated about correct desktop design, it's completely customizable from stock
[22:58:30] <feep> it also seems snappier than windows
[22:58:42] <galambo> I dont see ads. I acknowledge the spyware is an issue but I can use an enterprise version to avoid spyware
[22:58:45] <feep> and it's genuinely easier to get problems fixed ime
[22:59:07] <spxtr> linux is flossy and so you feel smug and superior to everyone else, which I like
[22:59:13] <feep> well by the time you start shopping for the mysterious secret enterprise version, you have already put in more effort than it generally takes to get a linux running
[22:59:21] <Betawolf> using an enterprise edition just changes how the spyware works
[22:59:45] <feep> but also there's simply a different incentive gradient
[22:59:57] <feep> opensource software wants to be useful, and for you to like it.
[23:00:19] <feep> it's held back, when it is, by a lack of skill or consensus
[23:00:22] <galambo> I am curious about what I am missing out on. I havent had major reliability issues with my windows setup
[23:00:45] <feep> windows wants, as the first-rate goal, to make money for microsoft
[23:00:54] <LeoTal> Windows is also fundamentally single-user, in that if you aren't root you can't do shit
[23:00:58] <feep> you liking it, or being useful, is an instrumental goal
[23:02:46] <spxtr> galambo: you can try out various linuxes in a vm pretty easily if you're bored someday
[23:02:56] <feep> experience won't be as good ofc but yes
[23:03:13] <feep> which like ... is the point, and the reason windows has linux vm support :p
[23:04:23] <galambo> do you guys recommend a certain distribution?
[23:04:35] <feep> depends what you're using it for
[23:04:45] <galambo> also again what should I look out for as an advantage over windows?
[23:04:48] <feep> like, do you want stability, do you want widest support, do you want gaming
[23:04:51] <galambo> doesnt linux use fedora?
[23:04:55] <galambo> linus*
[23:05:04] <galambo> I want them all :D
[23:05:05] <spxtr> mint or ubuntu are good for noobs I though
[23:05:06] <feep> idk but linux is a programmer :p his interests are not necessarily aligned
[23:05:07] <spxtr> thought*
[23:05:15] <feep> ubuntu is good for noobs, but I hate the interface
[23:05:19] <spxtr> same
[23:05:43] <feep> galambo: more customizability or less customizability? vaguely mac-like or vaguely windows-like?
[23:05:50] <feep> linus*
[23:06:07] <feep> galambo: anyway, the question about gaming ... I should ask this differently
[23:06:13] <galambo> what do you mean by customizability?
[23:06:17] <feep> do you want the hot newest features, even at the expense of stability?
[23:06:17] <cpopell> I am potentially going to be forced to get a Mac for a new job. I will just boot into Windows.
[23:06:29] <spxtr> yeah go for artix that's the best for noobs
[23:06:30] <galambo> what kind of features?
[23:06:43] <feep> like, would you trade a crash a month for the ability to run windows games with raytracing
[23:07:08] <PapuaHardyNet> Just buy two computers, and use one as a gaming machine with windows on it
[23:07:18] <PapuaHardyNet> or ubuntu + wine
[23:07:28] <feep> yeah but then you have to run ubuntu, which egh ugh eugh
[23:07:28] <galambo> stability I dont like crashing

[23:07:35] <feep> kay, not a rolling distro then probably
[23:07:35] <PapuaHardyNet> tbh, I use wine on arch linux and it is great, no complaints
[23:07:39] <Robomot> [Less Wrong [frontpage]] Noticing the Value of Noticing Confusion by TheTrueSquidward - https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/jzv63zmgmkRjHprPu/noticing-the-value-of-noticing-confusion
[23:07:56] <spxtr> fwiw I use a rolling release distro and haven't had a crash in months
[23:08:09] <spxtr> or years? idk
[23:08:11] <galambo> also I use kind of niche software. like an application that modifies the frequency curve of my audio output to make my headphones sound best
[23:08:11] <spxtr> been so long
[23:08:13] <feep> galambo: okay, there's basically plus or minus two desktop shells.
[23:08:25] <feep> gnome and kde
[23:08:26] <galambo> or an application that tracks my last.fm
[23:08:39] <feep> clementine can do that~
[23:08:53] <feep> not sure about frequency filtering, I think that's a bit messy to set up
[23:08:55] <galambo> or tells me how much internet each of my applications are using and allows me to limit them
[23:08:59] <feep> not sure if it gets easier with pipewire
[23:09:16] <feep> okay, gnome is the ubuntulike, super simple, fast to learn, not much room for customization
[23:09:20] <feep> er, the maclike
[23:09:40] <feep> kde is the windowslike, options out the wazoo, probably gonna look&feel more familiar and if not you can change it
[23:09:50] <feep> but has a bit less polish in some corners, simply because it has more corners
[23:09:55] <feep> you can run either on every distro
[23:10:16] <feep> so if you want stability and supportedness, and are coming from windows, I'd just grab kubuntu, or grab ubuntu and install kde-meta (same thing)
[23:10:53] <spxtr> I've been having some crackling sounds with pipewire that I've been meaning to look into. I feel like it's new enough that it's still quite rough
[23:11:15] <feep> ubuntu makes a new long-term support version every four years, so you should not have to upgrade everything for a while
[23:11:39] <feep> full disclosure: I love kde and dislike gnome :P

[23:13:06] <feep> galambo: to get ubuntu, you either grab a livecd or a usb stick and follow https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview
[23:13:07] <Robomot> Create a bootable USB stick on Windows | Ubuntu [] (Ubuntu is an open source software operating system that runs from the desktop, to the cloud, to all your internet connected things.)
[23:13:20] <feep> if you have a cd burner, you can just stick the iso on a cd instead
[23:13:41] *** Joins: two2thehead (~user@124.195.204.230)
[23:14:04] <feep> um, you need to know how to boot from a usb stick; this may depend on your computer. just know if there's awkward steps in there, it's 100% microsoft's fault.
[23:14:13] <galambo> I did try linux before. it ran very well on an old computer I had. I was impressed.
[23:14:31] <feep> well that's kinda playing to its strengths
[23:14:47] <feep> lots of time to get hardware supported plus low resource use
[23:15:21] <feep> galambo: anyway, fair warning in advance: you can absolutely get equalizer support on linux, but it will require console steps :p
[23:16:05] <galambo> feep, hmmm

[23:16:10] <feep> that said, it's actually probably a bit more flexible: the equalizer is just a sound card that you can play music to, so you can in principle do stuff like have one setting for music and one for discord
[23:17:11] *** Joins: pompolic (~bruh@91-137-144-5.opticon.hu)
[23:17:41] <feep> actually let me double check that's true, it might be stupid
[23:18:54] <feep> yeah okay bleh, that doesn't work
[23:19:23] <feep> hm maybe? lemme try
[23:19:28] <galambo> OK I will lay this plainly. I should have used linux 10 years ago. if I did I would have been familiar with it and known all its nuance and command line and stuff. but I am using windows and I feel comfortable with it. all the smart people are using linux. this is strong evidence that I am missing out. I am willing to invest time and effort into linux. but can you guys please let me know what I will gain?
[23:19:30] *** Quits: two2thehead (~user@124.195.204.230) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:20:04] <galambo> I am not a programmer but I do like computers
[23:20:18] <feep> the problem is I have no idea what your workflow is like
[23:20:50] <galambo> its mainly internet music irc anki word
[23:20:55] <galambo> games sometimes
[23:20:57] <feep> so I can only say generic shit like "it can do some things windows can't do, it cannot do some things windows can do (mostly run windows software :P), it does a lot of things differently, try it and see if it feels better"
[23:21:07] <LeoTal> bash is much much much better than cmd and somewhat better than powershell, so I'd get bash (comes free with, say, git) and learn it, and later consider switching oses
[23:21:12] *** Joins: two2thehead (~user@124.195.204.230)
[23:21:27] <feep> well anki should just work
[23:21:46] <galambo> I have a couple of cmd tools that are pretty neat. like youtube-dl and also some app that downloads music from deezer
[23:21:48] <feep> word might have compat difficulties, fair warning, libreoffice is pretty good but word is not a layout tool and the fonts are different
[23:22:03] <galambo> but I dont tend to use cmd
[23:22:03] <feep> everything that uses the commandline is going to be worlds better, just, no comparison
[23:22:22] <galambo> I do realize that cmd is a more efficient way of interacting with the computer than a gui
[23:22:23] <feep> firefox is firefox anywhere..
[23:22:27] <feep> chrome is also chrome anywhere
[23:22:49] <feep> irc, well, there's plenty of options
[23:22:55] <feep> music likewise~
[23:23:22] <feep> galambo: I mean, it's operating systems. they all basically do the same things
[23:23:41] <feep> like, linux doesn't have a magic special sauce that makes you go "this would never have been possible in windows even in theory"
[23:24:18] <feep> I use it because every time I've tried to do dev things on windows they've been either awkward or commercialized
[23:24:29] <feep> but that's not relevant to you
[23:24:45] <LeoTal> Also OSX comes with `say` out of the box, so I can make my computer insult me out loud
[23:24:49] <feep> haha
[23:25:02] <PapuaHardyNet> galambo: deemix doesn't work anymore unless you have a hifi account
[23:25:08] <saturn2> if you haven't bumped into any of windows's limitations there's not much benefit to switching to linux
[23:25:19] <PapuaHardyNet> (if you do, do throw me an ARL, I'd like to download some FLACs)
[23:25:27] <feep> eh. I think linux is genuinely better day to day
[23:25:52] <feep> for one, nobody dares anymore to change absolutely everything without offering a way back, because at this point they know the community will be like "no fuck you we'll stay where we are"
[23:26:07] <feep> which is definitely not an assurance you have on windows :p
[23:26:44] <kuudes> I still am suspicious of drm and telemetry on windows and os x
[23:26:49] <saturn2> if all you do is launch a browser, music player, anki, and word, linux will just be the same but with more bugs
[23:26:55] <feep> or less
[23:27:05] <galambo> PapuaHardyNet, I use deemix and it works ok. I dont have a pro account
[23:27:08] <feep> it is possible.
[23:27:11] <adiabatic> galambo: I dual-boot my windows machine into linux sometimes and things are just a little bit more annoying on linux. I should not have to run Discord setuid root, but there it is, asking for root permissions
[23:27:17] <galambo> it downloads 320kps sometimes and sometimes 128kps
[23:27:31] <feep> adiabatic: that ... really sounds like a discord bug :o
[23:27:40] <adiabatic> feep: very possible, don't care
[23:27:54] <feep> adiabatic: it doesn't do that for me at any rate.
[23:27:59] <adiabatic> like
[23:28:03] <adiabatic> I download the discord installer
[23:28:07] <saturn2> maybe discord is doing something underhanded
[23:28:09] <adiabatic> look at the permissions bits
[23:28:18] <adiabatic> and say "fuck no" and then just run it in Firefox
[23:28:22] <adiabatic> and it works just fine!
[23:28:24] <feep> waitwait permissions bits? :O
[23:28:28] <feep> you *downloaded* it setuid?
[23:28:34] <adiabatic> no, unpacked it
[23:28:37] <PapuaHardyNet> galambo: yeah you'll get only mp3s now, just saying
[23:28:37] <feep> oh okay
[23:28:47] <adiabatic> bbl, hours of meetings
[23:28:53] <feep> -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 127567112  9. Jul 22:15 /opt/discord/Discord
[23:28:55] <feep> fwiw
[23:29:19] <LeoTal> Yikes. unfollowed
[23:29:48] <feep> maybe gentoo does something to unfuck it
[23:30:18] <feep> anyway, I've always had the opposite experience on windows, every time I boot it it's awkward
[23:30:28] <saturn2> in the linux world, downloading installers from some website is usually not a good idea
[23:30:35] <kuudes> discord seems to crash both browser and pidgin consistently
[23:30:48] <galambo> PapuaHardyNet, I used to use smloadr and it was perfect. but it suddenly stopped working
[23:31:57] <feep> oyeah, here's another good linux thing. if there is an issue, the operating system doesn't hide anything from you.
[23:32:28] <feep> like, everything logs.
[23:32:51] <feep> hm, what else.... I think the folder layout is a lot more sensible, but that's kinda down to taste
[23:33:19] <feep> installing software is *usually* easier and more standardized
[23:33:27] <feep> and there's a blessed absence of vendor crap.
[23:34:35] <LeoTal> Also package managers exist
[23:34:43] <LeoTal> (Windows has chocolatey but ehhh)
[23:35:05] <rmmh> feep: windows has better logging functionality that linux
[23:35:15] <rmmh> it's a bit harder to get to
[23:35:19] <feep> rmmh: depends whether you mean os logging or app logging
[23:35:25] <LeoTal> OSX is in the amusing position of having one of the best package managers out there despite not having one
[23:36:04] <feep> hm, one somewhat niche benefit
[23:36:09] <feep> linux filesystems are just faster.
[23:37:27] <saturn2> the linux kernel is much faster than the windows kernel in pretty much every way
[23:37:43] <rmmh> LeoTal: hard to agree given how osx continues to try to lock down /usr/bin
[23:38:36] <LeoTal> rmmh: I don't remember brew having a problem with that, but then I don't remember shit
[23:39:10] <LeoTal> feep: Sure, ext4 is good, but reiserfs is killer
[23:39:17] <feep> I mean
[23:39:20] <feep> it genuinely is tho :v
[23:39:24] <LeoTal> [user was banned for this post]
[23:40:14] <saturn2> everyone's getting into true crime these days, maybe reiserfs can make a comeback

[23:57:37] <spxtr> I moved into an apartment with a coin laundry machine and quickly discovered that quarters are also in shortage somehow
[23:57:47] <gwern> spxtr: although in some areas the dog shortage long-predated covid anyway. spay and neuter has been so successful that some areas have run out of dogs, period, and they import them. like the US north is in a dog deficit, so there are orgs to export from the american south which always has a surplus. they have big 16 wheel trucks shipping dogs
[23:58:15] * gwern mentioned that he drove behind one for a while. he estimatd that it could easily have several hundred dogs in it, given reasonable packing
[23:58:47] <gwern> coins have also been in a shortage, but that one is corona, afaik. I'm not sure why there, but for a while you'd see signs all over about a coin shortage and requiring exact change
[23:59:10] <kuudes> why don't they mint more?
[23:59:14] <spxtr> huh, interesting about the dogs
[23:59:26] <gwern> kuudes: dunno. maybe the workers were furloughed?
[23:59:26] <spxtr> kuudes: what I've seen is that they are minting the same as usual, there's some circulation issue instead
