[16:51:56] <ikaronen_relex> Anyone know how to run a single JUnit test from JRuby's test suite?

[16:53:05] <ikaronen_relex> Also, it seems that "mvn -Ptest" isn't running any tests from the core/src/test/java/org/jruby/exceptions directory. What am I doing wrong?
[17:03:48] <ikaronen_relex> Well, I got it to work by moving my test class to core/src/test/java/org/jruby/test. Still very slow since I have to run the whole test suite each time, but at least I can confirm that it reproduces now. :/

[17:11:12] <ikaronen_relex> nice, ping timeoutâ€¦
[17:50:59] <ikaronen_relex> Anyway, the issue and test case I wanted to report is now at https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6972
[17:55:45] <ikaronen_relex> I do wish I could some day learn how to build and test JRuby locally without a bunch of stuff breaking all the time. It would've saved me several hours of work just with this single bug report. Anyway, have a nice evening y'all. (I'm assuming there are actually people reading this channel and that I just showed up at a super quiet time.)
