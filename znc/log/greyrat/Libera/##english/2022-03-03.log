[08:06:59] <Voxel> LjL, like a person said  - "I need a server to configure.", hence the question.
[08:07:35] <LjL> why "is assumed"?
[08:07:43] <LjL> "What kind of server do you need?" seems like the obvious question
[08:09:21] <Voxel> They assumed something thus I asked for a clarification.
[08:09:29] <Voxel> They don't need a server, but assume I know which one
[08:10:37] <LjL> i don't understand. "I need to configure a server" would mean that they already have a server, and they must configure it. "I need a server to configure" means they don't have a server, but need to get one so they can configure it.

[19:35:02] <GuiToris> hello, what does this sentence mean? He admitted to a partial relapse during the COVID-19 pandemic
[19:35:22] <bin> GuiToris: which part, "partial relapse"?
[19:35:29] <GuiToris> uhum
[19:35:39] <GuiToris> I have no idea what that means
[19:35:43] <bin> It means someone went back to using drugs partly during the pandemic
[19:35:52] <bin> or sex or whatever their addiction was
[19:36:08] <GuiToris> drug yes, thank you
[19:36:23] <bin> yeah "relapse" means losing sobriety
[19:36:30] <mizzunet> AFIK, relapse means, grow worse one's health condition
[19:36:36] <bin> partial relapse means partially, maybe they just had 1 drink
[19:36:55] <bin> vs going back to using regularly
[19:37:16] <GuiToris> is alcohol considered to be a drug?
[19:37:19] <bin> mizzunet: yes, when referring to an illness it means one's sickness has returned
[19:37:22] <bin> GuiToris: yes
[19:37:49] <bin> There are different levels of sobriety too.
[19:37:49] <GuiToris> thank you, whenever I hear the word drugs I can only think of heroin or cocaine
[19:38:02] <bin> Some people can drink alcohol without issue but had cocaine addiction
[19:38:05] <mizzunet> same for me
[19:38:10] <mizzunet> :D
[19:38:18] <bin> or some people have alcohol addiction but can use cannabis or pain medication safely
[19:38:56] <bin> GuiToris: yeah there's definitely a different attitude toward alcohol and it's a shame really
[19:39:10] <bin> alcohol destroys lives. It's an addictive toxin.
[19:39:34] <bin> but it's socially acceptable. Cocaine and heroin once were too. I am pleased to see cannabis becoming more acceptable given its safety.
[19:40:29] <GuiToris> interesting that you also say that alcohol is worse than cannabis, some people say that
[19:41:26] <pussipupu> This reminds me, I need to make some alcohol
