[00:00:16] <pteague> there are so many conspiracy theories going around ... the big question though is which of those conspiracy theories will no longer be a conspiracy theory, but will be front page news in 6+ months ...
[00:00:18] <mixfix41> you should apologise
[00:00:31] <mixfix41> theres politics-unban i believe
[00:01:08] <mixfix41> its 1on1 so im not sure why you are expressing it here..
[00:01:16] <pteague> oh, right ... unseat cpu & try with no heat sink ... i need to plug psu back in
[00:02:10] <mixfix41> they obviously tell you never to do it again so i suggest you should cause ive never tip them off before and i express some comedic things there before
[00:03:04] <mixfix41> i almost agree that politics maybe shouldnt have a place on libera 
[00:03:11] <mixfix41> i should agree 
[00:03:30] <coeus> you just block your oppenent, and then when they are off balance hit him back hard or make them turn sideways, throw him or do something to force him back, then use your finishing strike 
[00:03:38] <mixfix41> say if i ever acquire a golden uzi i will never politic on irc

[04:56:37] <ButterNoodle> tbh I forgot about terra formers.. I've been seeding it for years
[04:57:56] <cthulchu_> It was actually intriguing at first, but then the quality quickly dropped. It's actually common in Anime for the quality to drop with time.
[04:58:08] <ButterNoodle> yep.. deadlines
[04:58:23] <cthulchu_> so like the first-second episode becomes A LOT better than tenth
[04:58:31] <cthulchu_> I mean, even story-wis
[04:58:34] <cthulchu_> wise
[04:58:35] <ButterNoodle> I think I passed on it when it aired.. I think either clockwork planet or worlds end took its place as a better anime
[04:59:07] <ButterNoodle> worlds end was pretty good..
[04:59:32] <ButterNoodle> I still remember it years later.. so its eiter terrible, or real good

[10:37:29] <amigojapan> MootPoot: set that timer on daily repeat
[10:37:31] <DunceCotus> we know death happens to all living things but that's about it
[10:38:02] <DunceCotus> like people who say you need to come to terms with you're going to die.. but what does that mean?
[10:38:04] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: all living things have cells
[10:38:07] <DunceCotus> non-existence? Why is that assumed?

[10:39:48] <DunceCotus> its possible that life evolves to develop the organism that will break out of this egg

[10:51:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: what is called reincarnation is actually all within the same life stage
[10:51:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we live out all reincarnations simultaneously
[10:51:24] <DunceCotus> per life stage
[10:52:02] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so when people are remembering a 'past life' its actually a parallel life
[10:52:28] <DunceCotus> cause the life stage covers a duration of time
[10:52:42] <amigojapan> I don't remember any part life. I think those people are full of poop DunceCotus

[10:55:07] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you are credulous, I am skeptical
[10:55:13] <DunceCotus> no immediate profit, and generally people in modern age just think you're crazy etc

[10:56:46] <DunceCotus> now we should have some skepticism particularly surrounding very detailed descriptions of experience
[10:57:05] <DunceCotus> like people saying they met Jesus or they had detailed visions of the future etc.
[10:57:24] <DunceCotus> however that could be embellishments on a real religious/spiritual experience they had
[10:58:09] <DunceCotus> we have to also take into account that people will interpret these experiences through the modern religious lenses we have to work with
[10:59:31] <DunceCotus> like really bad experience = hell, or really good experience = heaven, or encounter with a power beyond ourselves and what we know = God etc.

[12:28:36] <amigojapan> Ok MootPoot I understand that
[12:28:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: when I was a child I felt like I had access to some arcane knowledge
[12:29:12] <DunceCotus> but that quickly faded with inculcation into good sense, modernity
[12:29:38] <amigojapan> I see DunceCotus 
[12:29:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: then in 2013 onwards I started to experiment with weed and psychedelics
[12:30:14] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: and it became clear that there's a lot we simply don't understand, layers of consciousness we are hardly scratching the surface of in modern life
[12:30:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you frigged up your brain like me. That is all that happened
[12:30:41] <DunceCotus> no I wouldn't say that
[12:31:22] <JesseDesu> i spent 4 hours trying to solve something in my database form
[12:31:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: besides I don't think there's any wastage in life
[12:31:29] <JesseDesu> i finally got it to work
[12:32:26] <DunceCotus> as horrible as suffering can be or as seemingly wasteful as certain uses of time can seem
[12:32:41] <DunceCotus> its all productive, it all feeds into production
[12:33:01] <DunceCotus> wasted years can lead to changing one's outlook etc.
[12:33:09] <DunceCotus> so not truly a waste
[12:33:43] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: 'frigged up brain' doesn't stop desire
[12:33:51] <Bco1981> activating XP in 2021... it can't connect online activation...
[12:34:16] <PancakeMatsuri> JesseDesu typical
[12:34:30] <PancakeMatsuri> of programming issues
[12:34:44] <JesseDesu> PancakeMatsuri, i dont program
[12:34:48] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: do you agree that the brain is an electrochemical device? And that chemicals can alter it's activity?
[12:35:06] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yes
[12:35:21] <amigojapan> Alright DunceCotus 
[12:36:21] <JesseDesu> i was so concentrated on my task that i forgot to piss
[12:36:28] <JesseDesu> and i'm hungry asf now
[12:38:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but the brain is simply one mode of organisation
[12:38:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we are not limited to any one mode of organisation
[12:38:46] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: seems to be the organ that causes consiousness
[12:38:52] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the modern consciousness however is symbiotic with this mode of organisation
[12:39:24] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: production of production
[12:40:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: think of it like Escher's hand drawing hand (drawing hand etc.) sketch
[12:40:47] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: brain produces consciousness produces brain
[12:40:48] <Bco1981> phone activation still works
[12:41:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: however there is I think strata of consciousness that is not limited to biological organisations (but instead is symbiotic with other organisations)
[12:42:05] <DunceCotus> it is in this sense it is wrong to think of an origin point of consciousness, or of brains
[12:42:05] <JesseDesu> lol i am starting to forget what i'm looking at on the screen

[13:50:45] <JesseDesu> i need sleep now
[13:50:52] <JesseDesu> i've been awake 22 hours
[13:50:55] <mexen> the point is why are you using base? I'm intrigued... there's a guy at work who uses access... I find access and base to be a bit too simplistic for what I want to do so I end up just going with a web app, stick a mariadb or postgresql in the back and call it a day. Nothing wrong with using base, I'm just curious
[13:51:02] <amigojapan> Access is the worst database program from Microsoft. They should have stuck with fox pro
[13:51:03] <Urchin[emacs]> I've had a misfortune to work with an accounting program that used Access databases as it's back end

[13:54:22] <mexen> JesseDesu: all right fair enough, my first "DB" was an Excel sheet. I moved to Access that semester in first year before I ever found out about mysql etc
[13:54:49] <mexen> Is the app for personal use?
[13:54:56] <mexen> form rather
[13:55:27] <JesseDesu> the form is
[13:55:49] <mexen> amigojapan: oof, I feel you... ever since we came back to the office 2 weeks ago, all we do is hold Teams meetings... yikes... so I am also bored a lot of the time haha
[13:56:20] <JesseDesu> honestly dont know if the form is convertible to other formats
[13:56:50] <amigojapan> Ouch mexen also. Your company should not have gone back to the office in the middle of Corona
[13:57:57] <mexen> I don't know about now but in my team, you needed base to open the forms...you might get some integration with calc or even writer. So I can see someone who is a heavy office user building simple, useful tools to do some of their work. Some guys here even use base to prototype DBs.

[14:00:33] <mexen> eh when it will end lol
[14:01:03] <mexen> night MootPoot ... my MBA M1 came in a fews ago BTW and it is probably my favourite laptop. Ever.
[14:01:12] <JesseDesu> i should sleep too
[14:01:26] <amigojapan> Gn Jesse
[14:01:33] <MootPoot> It's pretty good 
[14:01:34] <PancakeMatsuri> JesseDesu yeah, that counts
[14:01:35] <mexen> JesseDesu: most certainly, mister
[14:01:38] <MootPoot> I have had a few issues 
[14:02:03] <mexen> OK, tell me all about them when you wake up bud
[14:02:20] <MootPoot> The battery life is a little bs
[14:02:41] <MootPoot> Once you get actual programs on it and run it, your real battery life is like 8h
[14:02:49] <MootPoot> Not 14-15h
[14:03:11] <MootPoot> Or if you plug in an external HDD to deal with the pathetic storage 
[14:03:35] <MootPoot> And nonsense with apples own file system and refusal to work with ntfs without workarounds 
[14:03:39] <JesseDesu> ok, 1 more hour then i bed
[14:03:47] <amigojapan> MootPoot: as you know I am a very heavy use. And my battery life is like 12h continuous use
[14:04:02] <MootPoot> amigojapan: you have a MacBook Air with the M1?
[14:04:22] <amigojapan> Oh MootPoot I did not know you meant that
[14:07:18] <mexen> I suppose with time I will get there, I should be at 52%, last charged it 4 days ago but I have been using it for ssh, scripting and admin stuff, some wireframing and documentation
[14:07:38] <mexen> I imagine once I actually open vscode or similar, I will be looking at similar times to yours MootPoot 
[14:07:41] <JesseDesu> you need that macbook air with an M1 garand rifle
[14:07:56] <mexen> amigojapan: what laptop are you using?
[14:08:21] <amigojapan> mexen: I am not using a laptop. I was talking about my phone
[14:08:49] <amigojapan> mexen: it's a Sharp phone
[14:09:07] <mexen> ah, so. My xiaomi is a tank. I turn it on at 4am and immediately start using it. By the time  I go to bed at midnight, it's usually at 42%
[14:09:18] <MootPoot> ni-mh batteries are annoying
[14:09:28] <MootPoot> they dont hold charge if you leave them charged for a month
[14:09:40] <mexen> wow a Sharp phone! Only in Japan! hehe kidding
[14:09:43] <JesseDesu> hassoon would say you have a shar'ap phone
[14:10:06] <mexen> nah hassoon has a dooooooooooooooooooooooooooood phone obviously
[14:10:26] <amigojapan> mexen: sharp aquos phone
[14:11:12] <amigojapan> mexen: it also only coated 300usd new like a year ago
[14:11:29] <amigojapan> Costed*
[14:11:42] <mexen> Cost* /me winks
[14:11:51] <mexen> ay!
[14:12:12] <JesseDesu> rolling my own
[14:12:29] <mexen> my xiaomi was 200 bucks but the exchange rate was a mess when I bought it, so it really is around $120-$150
[14:13:06] <MootPoot> Banana
[14:13:06] <JesseDesu> i have a xiaomi poco f2
[14:13:08] <amigojapan> I see mexen .I really like this phone. The screen is nice and large
[14:13:37] <JesseDesu> i paid like $500 for it
[14:13:48] <mexen> Used to despise big phones (just get a tablet!) but now, I find them very useful while still being portable
[14:13:55] <MootPoot> mexen: I got a small expansion dock and two external drives for the Mac to make it useable
[14:13:58] <amigojapan> Both MootPoot and Jesse said they were going to sleep and are still here
[14:14:18] <MootPoot> A 500gb external ssd and a 5tb external hdd
[14:14:29] <mexen> MootPoot: online? Can you link me?

[14:31:21] <MootPoot> My mailbox is farther then 15m away
[14:31:22] <MootPoot> Lol
[14:32:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: with the new mall. I have an electronics shop 15min away by foot
[14:33:11] <amigojapan> My mailbox is on my door
[14:35:03] <JesseDesu> my mailbox is literally a slot in my garage door, with a cardboard box behind it to catch the mail
[14:35:21] <MootPoot> I bought a solar panel for camping
[14:35:27] <amigojapan> Now you know you can blow up my apartment by sending a bomb to my post box

[14:35:44] <MootPoot> amigojapan: lol wat
[14:36:04] <amigojapan> MootPoot: cause I said it is on my door

[14:36:37] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[14:37:01] <JesseDesu> why would you camp just to use electronics that feed on power banks
[14:37:41] <amigojapan> I don't get that either Jesse

[14:39:29] <amigojapan> Bears I think you can use pepper spray
[14:39:37] <JesseDesu> are there cabin logs or do you pitch a tent
[14:40:17] <amigojapan> Last time I went camping I stayed in a camper. But I prefer to pitch a tent
[14:40:30] <JesseDesu> i dont see how camping is safe at all
[14:40:37] <JesseDesu> especially in a tent
[14:40:55] <amigojapan> There are risks, yes
[14:42:22] <amigojapan> Jesse back in Mexico when I was a kid. The school would take us on a camp trip pretty often
[14:43:06] <amigojapan> We would have a huge fire.i love the smell of burning wood
[14:44:18] <DunceCotus> I hate fires
[14:44:23] <amigojapan> Theoretically fire repels animals too
[14:44:30] <JesseDesu> fires hate you
[14:44:32] <DunceCotus> smoky and doesn't heat you up unless you're directly on it
[14:44:33] <amigojapan> Why DunceCotus 
[14:45:00] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: was not in cold weather. I like smoky
[14:45:21] <DunceCotus> im pretty sure my life expectancy has been cut a few decades from sitting in front of camp fires
[14:45:22] <DunceCotus> xD
[14:45:25] <JesseDesu> if you sleep while the fire is burning you could easily bring down the forest
[14:45:28] <DunceCotus> smoke is awful

[14:50:02] <amigojapan> Those were good days
[14:50:14] <amigojapan> Ouch MootPoot 
[14:50:21] <MootPoot> But anyway
[14:50:36] <MootPoot> The point of camping is to chill outside
[14:50:44] <MootPoot> Not to become bear Grylls
[14:51:25] <MootPoot> I really rather like watching anime in the forest air
[14:51:37] <amigojapan> MootPoot: can you really chill with all the electronics you bring?
[14:52:26] <MootPoot> Yeah, why not
[14:52:52] <MootPoot> I can chill with any amount of electronics
[14:52:58] <amigojapan> Dunno. I just can't relate
[14:53:24] <MootPoot> My idea of a relaxing time is not disconnecting from computers completely
[14:53:36] <MootPoot> Well, I am gen z technically
[14:53:53] <MootPoot> So there was no point in my life that I was disconnected digitally
[14:54:03] <MootPoot> Unlike you

[14:56:48] <MootPoot> My Swiss Army knife finally got accepted
[14:57:02] <MootPoot> At the repair center 
[14:57:09] <MootPoot> I sent it off like a month ago 
[14:57:18] <MootPoot> Was sitting in intake until just now 
[14:57:28] <MootPoot> They say 3 weeks for it to be fixed 
[14:57:31] <JesseDesu> why would you send it without being accepted first
[14:57:38] <Sapphirus> I have this weird nostalgia for an era that I've never lived in.
[14:57:47] <Sapphirus> Still am unable to reconcile why.
[14:58:07] <MootPoot> It's already accepted, but they're backlogged so even when it got there it was sitting in a pile for 3 weeks 
[14:58:19] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: the 80s?
[14:58:25] <MootPoot> Before it got accepted into their system 
[14:58:31] <Sapphirus> 80s-90s, amigojapn, yeah.
[14:59:13] <amigojapan> I see yeah Sapphirus . Probably you have watched things from that time

[20:05:42] <HubertFarnsworth> yes Guest1539 
[20:05:55] <HubertFarnsworth> Inferno is just a part of it btw
[20:06:28] <HubertFarnsworth> there are also purgatory, heaven
[20:06:30] <amigojapan> Guest1539: yeah
[20:07:10] <HubertFarnsworth> there are different translations btw, check out them and see what you like
[20:07:11] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: there is a hell for fat people in it
[20:07:19] <HubertFarnsworth> yes amigojapan 
[20:07:50] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: there is also hell for unbaptized, lazy, those who don't help others
[20:08:00] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: the Buddhist hell is also similar
[20:08:34] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I wood be in multiple hells hahaha
[20:08:36] <HubertFarnsworth> woah, Buddhists have hell?
[20:08:43] <HubertFarnsworth> true amigojapan 
[20:09:20] <Guest1539> sometimes the bible seems like anime
[20:09:32] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: yeah I'm it depends on what sect of Buddhism. Some believe hell is a place. Some believe it is a state of mind
[20:10:16] <HubertFarnsworth> what mind? our brains are nothing but decaying organic matter after death
[20:10:18] <amigojapan> Guest1539: well. Dante's hell is not the Bible
[20:10:49] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: state of mind while you are alive
[20:10:57] <HubertFarnsworth> ah
[20:11:17] <HubertFarnsworth> I wonder if people really fear hell though amigojapan
[20:11:36] <amigojapan> I did when I was in the cult HubertFarnsworth 
[20:11:49] <HubertFarnsworth> I mean even though we have all kinds of hell people commit crimes without second thought
[20:12:11] <Sxem> hell only scares children. adults pretend to be scared of hell
[20:12:12] <Guest1539> looking into Dante's hell
[20:12:32] <HubertFarnsworth> beaky: have you seen rurouni kenshin movie? Kasumi is in that movie
[20:12:55] <Jigsy> Hell is other people.
[20:13:00] <HubertFarnsworth> I love how he opens the inferno
[20:13:25] <Jigsy> Hell's such a weirdly stupid concept.
[20:13:31] <Jigsy> "If you do X, you're going to hell!"
[20:13:32] <Guest1539> that's mean
[20:13:38] <Jigsy> Okay, but does it work retroactively?
[20:13:45] <Jigsy> Like, what if it was okay before a point?
[20:13:54] <Jigsy> So fucking stupid.
[20:14:24] <Jigsy> Like if say... jaywalking suddenly sent you to hell.
[20:14:24] <Guest1539> it's a complicated topic man
[20:14:45] <HubertFarnsworth> no need for that Jigsy, one can pray and be forgiven for all their sins
[20:14:49] <amigojapan> Jigsy: I think Dante's hell at least purgatory, you could escape after a while
[20:14:51] <Jigsy> And Jaywalking isn't even a crime in most countries.
[20:15:02] <HubertFarnsworth> and if one makes enough donations, they can dine with god
[20:15:05] <Guest1539> interesting how judas is stuck in Dante's hell
[20:15:13] <Guest1539> and so is some other historical figures
[20:15:37] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah Guest1539, all philosophers are in hell
[20:15:42] <Jigsy> And then there's murder...
[20:15:45] <HubertFarnsworth> Guest1539: and also the great kings
[20:15:47] <Jigsy> Are soldiers exempt?
[20:15:50] <amigojapan> Jigsy: well they would say it is not crime but "sin"
[20:15:53] <HubertFarnsworth> nope
[20:16:50] <Guest1539> It's like hell from Fusion Reborn
[20:16:53] <Guest1539> in DragonBall Z
[20:17:19] <Jigsy> I'm still down on my census as a firm believer in the Church of Planeptune.

[20:21:32] <HubertFarnsworth> btw Dio wrote the lyrics for that
[20:22:11] <HubertFarnsworth> I like Jesus in Southpark. He is good guy.
[20:22:50] <Guest1539> what about hinduism and lord shiva?
[20:23:31] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't believe in any religion Guest1539 
[20:23:53] <Guest1539> why not?
[20:23:59] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I read it
[20:24:00] <HubertFarnsworth> basically they all say the same which is, don't be a dick
[20:24:05] <coeus> It's my guess that Jesus didn't have name for the rich man because his name was not in the book of life so it didn't even matter
[20:24:27] <coeus> another words, he was already dead 
[20:24:44] <amigojapan> coeus: yeah Jesus started the hell idea in Western religions
[20:25:03] <coeus> he did not have life
[20:25:58] <HubertFarnsworth> Guest1539: ah, do you want to get into this now? I believe in Science. In an causal universe, there can't be any god.
[20:26:00] <coeus> what does it mean to have life? it means to become like Lazerus, a poor man who loved God and obeyed his commandments instead
[20:26:05] <Guest1539> best be careful when talking bout this
