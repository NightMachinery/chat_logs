[00:00:21] <gwozniak> No one is writing new register allocators and optimiziers for IRs
[00:00:25] <riv> I wonder if there's a browser addon to bring back dislikes
[00:01:48] <epilys> gwozniak, yeah my bad
[00:02:15] <gwozniak> I see other people saying the same thing
[00:02:36] <ngoldbaum> gwozniak: from rustc’s perspective it’s a backend
[00:05:27] <gwozniak> Is someone trying to make rustc target GCC?  I know of at least the Rust GCC project, which aims to bring a Rust front end to GCc
[00:05:46] <gerikson> at this point, it's worth for a project to use Discord just to avoid Drew shwoing up
[00:05:51] <Geekingfrog> ouch
[00:06:01] <epilys> https://lwn.net/Articles/871283/
[00:06:02] <buttsbot> Rust and GCC, two different ways [LWN.net]
[00:07:08] <gwozniak> So targeting the GCC backend/IR
[00:07:20] <gwozniak> Still not a backend, imo
[00:09:45] <gwozniak> I think targetting GCC with the libgccjit is... questionable in the long run.  I don't know enough about it, but GCC's IR was not designed in any way to be targetted by anything other than GCC front ends.  I would not be surprised if some kind of wall was hit
[00:10:44] <gwozniak> But I guess it depends which IR is being targetted, since there are 2 or 3, depending on how you look at it
[00:11:32] <ngoldbaum> seems like gccrs is also an enormous challenge
[00:11:49] <gwozniak> Yes.  It has its work cut out for it
[00:11:53] <ngoldbaum> they haven’t done the borrow checker yet, as of that lwn article
[00:14:09] <gwozniak> Hrm, libgccjit might be okay, actually, now that I am looking into it more.  Still not sure at what level it is being applied, but it's the usual GCC hackery mess, so who knows
[00:14:50] <gwozniak> LTO is goddamn mess in GCC that mostly works, but working with it is a nightmare
[00:19:15] <gwozniak> libgccjit looks like you're bascially mapping to C types
[00:22:38] <gwozniak> https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/topics/types.html
[00:22:38] <buttsbot> Types — libgccjit 12.0.0 (experimental ) documentation
[00:23:29] <gwozniak> So roughly speaking, the libgccjit route is Rust -> C and having GCC compile the C, but not actual C code
[00:24:20] <gwozniak> I guess I'd have to see what the gcc_jit_* calls do internally
[00:24:36] <gwozniak> Probably translate to GIMPLE

[01:58:23] <riv> it's 100% true
[01:58:44] <Brekkjern> We can't agree on how lift is generated by wings even...
[01:58:56] <manicennui> I don't doubt that there was a point in history when we didn't understand how insects fly.
[01:59:00] <Brekkjern> I mean, there is an accepted common theory, but it doesn't explain it properly
[01:59:10] <Brekkjern> Fluid dynamics. Not even once.
[01:59:49] <manicennui> Brekkjern: We understand it well enough to know how to take advantage of it and optimize it.
[02:00:07] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Sure, ish
[02:00:22] <manicennui> Is there anything in science that we truly understand absolutely?

[02:01:07] <buttsbot> How Does A Wing Actually Work? - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFO4PBolwFg
[02:01:17] <skyl4rk> kind of requires diving deep into what it means to understand something
[02:01:33] <manicennui> Do bird and insect wings even work the same way?
[02:01:47] <manicennui> I guess one stage of flight might.
[02:01:58] <riv> i don't think they work the same way no
[02:02:17] <manicennui> The way birds take off might be similar.
[02:02:22] * manicennui has no idea.
[02:02:28] <manicennui> And then there are birds like hummingbirds.
[02:02:34] <Brekkjern> Insect wings do not work the same way as fixed wing aircrafts do.
[02:02:43] <Brekkjern> Or, that's not entirely correct, but again...
[02:03:12] <Brekkjern> Both fixed wing and insect wings work on deflection of air, but the mechanism is somewhat different.
[02:03:47] <riv> https://www.straightdope.com/21342288/is-it-aerodynamically-impossible-for-bumblebees-to-fly this was fun
[02:03:51] <buttsbot> Is it aerodynamically impossible for bumblebees to fly? - The Straight Dope
[02:04:05] <skyl4rk> without looking it up I would say that at least small birds and insects is simple newtonion physics, push down mass of air -> mass of bird goes up
[02:04:46] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but you are missing the low pressure zone that builds up on the top of the wing which is part of bernoulis principle
[02:05:31] <Brekkjern> Either explanation works, but they don't explain the entire effect
[02:05:38] <Brekkjern> Only in combination do they do that
[02:05:47] <Brekkjern> Or, well enough to explain most of it...
[02:05:48] <manicennui> skyl4rk: That simple explanation wouldn't explain how they don't go down when the wing comes back up.
[02:05:51] <Brekkjern> Fuck fluid mechanics.
[02:05:56] <skyl4rk> haven't done physics for years, ceartainly not avionics anyway
[02:06:16] <Brekkjern> I only did this for a paraglider certificate, and I didn't quite finish it
[02:06:44] <skyl4rk> manicennui: my answer to that would be that just like when you row, it's about how you tilt the oar/wing compared to the movement axis
[02:07:18] <manicennui> Is there rowing where you don't lift the oar to move it back into the starting position?
[02:07:44] <manicennui> The resistance of air and water are very different.
[02:07:49] <Brekkjern> Yes, but you wiggle the oar from left to right instead of front to back
[02:07:54] <manicennui> Also, how do penguins swim underwater?
[02:08:06] <Brekkjern> They use their wings
[02:08:15] <skyl4rk> ok, perhaps not for rowing in the classical sense, but you could
[02:09:02] <Brekkjern> You could rotate the oar so the drag is lower when pushing the oar forward, but it's more effective to just lift it out of the water
[02:09:44] <skyl4rk> next time you stand around in a lake (distributing swords) take your right hand and move it to the left in front of you holding it so that the palm is perpendicular to the movement axis (thumb up), then turn your hand so ninety degrees and move back, you will not face the same resistance
[02:09:45] <Brekkjern> Water has considerably more drag than air, so even if you don't rotate the oar for the lowest profile, you will still come out on top by just lifting the oar out of the water
[02:10:03] <manicennui> "Penguin wings are paddle-like flippers used for swimming. The motion of the flippers resembles the wing movements of flying birds, giving penguins the appearance of flying through water. The wing and breast muscles are well developed, to propel penguins through water - a medium much denser than air."
[02:10:12] <manicennui> So are the physics similar?
[02:10:17] <Brekkjern> skyl4rk: You are describing angle of attack
[02:10:21] <manicennui> There is no "lift" in water, is there?
[02:10:35] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Kinda, but water isn't compressible, so there are a lot of things about bernoulis principle that don't work as well
[02:11:04] <mgdm> Not lifting it all the way out of the water and letting the boat drag it backwards over you is not fun and is called “catching a crab” in the part of the world I’m from
[02:11:17] <riv> :O
[02:11:20] <riv> that is really interesting!
[02:11:21] <Brekkjern> Technically speaking you will have a high and low pressure zone on opposing sides of the flipper in water, but it will be marginal

[02:11:31] <buttsbot> How Do Penguins Swim? | TheDeepHull - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKDR2EV_UCE
[02:11:40] <skyl4rk> Brekkjern: I'm not sure if you are annotating my water exercise, or saying that I'm describing a different phenomena
[02:11:43] <manicennui> They do flap them, but also get a lot out of minimal movement.
[02:12:42] <Brekkjern> skyl4rk: Angle of attack is what angle you push your "wing" through the medium
[02:13:13] <skyl4rk> yes
[02:15:05] <Brekkjern> Man, I wish I remembered more about this, because stall mechanics are rather interesting
[02:15:10] * manicennui had forgotten all about Rands in Repose.
[02:15:11] <Brekkjern> And complicated
[02:15:26] <skyl4rk> so my point is that a bird or insect can fly by flapping their wings and adjusting the angle of attack during the stroke to achieve the desired effect
[02:15:33] <Brekkjern> Exactly
[02:15:48] <riv> According to all known laws of physics, penguins should not be able to swim
[02:15:54] <skyl4rk> ha!
[02:16:12] <Brekkjern> Which is the same way a helicopter works, but helicopters just keep the rotor moving in one rotational direction
[02:16:23] <Brekkjern> Instead of moving it back and forth that is
[02:16:25] <skyl4rk> yes
[02:16:29] <skyl4rk> lazy helicopters!
[02:16:34] <Brekkjern> lol
[02:17:21] <Brekkjern> Honestly though, helicopters scare me, because they will have more lift on the forward rotation than the backwards one, which means that in my head a helicopter should always roll to one side
[02:17:29] <manicennui> Can you imagine how terrifying our flying machines would be if they flapped huge metal wings quickly?
[02:17:45] <Brekkjern> Dune ornithhopters, let's go!
[02:17:59] <skyl4rk> damn you, I was about to post about the dune ornithopters
[02:18:05] <Brekkjern> Hahaha
[02:18:17] <Brekkjern> They also make zero sense from an aerodynamics perspective
[02:18:24] <skyl4rk> I'm referencing the books though, bet you were referencing the movies pfft
[02:18:41] <Brekkjern> Been too long since I read the books to remember how they were described there
[02:18:45] <Brekkjern> Other than that they had flapping wings
[02:19:06] <skyl4rk> ...well that's kind of my situation as well, to be frank (herbert)
[02:19:07] <Brekkjern> And considering they go by the name "Ornithopters" I bet they are more like birds than insects
[02:19:20] <skyl4rk> haven't seen the movie though
[02:19:28] <Brekkjern> You should. It's good.
[02:19:47] * manicennui wonders whether the movie is back on HBO Max yet
[02:19:56] <Brekkjern> Yarr harr!

[02:21:09] <skyl4rk> yeah, for being such a heavy scifi cornerstone, and additionally having a controversial filmatization already (Lynch's), I find just the fact that there seems to be no large scale general disappointment with this version a pretty promising sign

[02:21:58] <manicennui> skyl4rk: Geeks are too busy being mad about women and non-whites in entertainment.
[02:22:24] <skyl4rk> I've been away from "watching movies" for so long by now though, so even movies that I guess even ones that would have a pull on me fail to.
[02:22:30] <manicennui> The kind of geeks who get really upset about adaptations that is.
[02:23:58] <Brekkjern> Honestly, I think people were just starved for decent movies to come out, so nobody really wanted to criticize Dune
[02:24:03] <manicennui> Obviously they didn't put a lot of thought into the physics of ornithopters, but is there a point at which size becomes a problem with flapping wings?
[02:24:11] <skyl4rk> bleh, that last sentence was word salad
[02:24:14] <Brekkjern> Well, momentum for once :P
[02:24:22] <Brekkjern> And stiffness of the wing
[02:25:00] <Brekkjern> I am also betting that the ends of the blades will break the sound barrier, which is generally bad on rotary aircrafts for reasons I don't fully understand
[02:27:16] <Brekkjern> Aerodynamics be complicated yo
[02:27:32] * manicennui sticks to CRUD software.
[02:27:40] <Brekkjern> Also, I never had to worry about my wing ever reaching anywhere close to the sound barrier, so we didn't go into the physics of that during the paraglider certification
[02:28:49] <skyl4rk> well, imagine you're in the tower, and you've just getting your first cup of coffe, and then someone comes and bangs through the sound barrier, coffee all over your shirt
[02:29:19] <skyl4rk> *coffee
[02:29:20] <Brekkjern> Heh
[02:29:32] <skyl4rk> friggin one word I should be able to spell correctly
[02:29:58] <Brekkjern> AFAIK, breaking the sound barrier is much more difficult at lower altitudes because the air is much denser
[02:30:14] <skyl4rk> makes sense
[02:32:17] <Brekkjern> My understanding of supersonic flight is pretty weak though :P
[02:34:19] <Brekkjern> Related, but the speed of sound varies with the medium it travels through. The same is true for light.
[02:35:04] <Brekkjern> IIRC, the speed of light in a fiberoptic cable is 0.7c, which means radio actually has lower latency.
[02:37:25] <skyl4rk> wave propagation perhaps, but I'm not gonna switch out my desktop copper for a wifi connection anyway
[02:37:47] <skyl4rk> and that's not even fiber
[02:38:37] * manicennui sells thick air to gamers to increase wifi speeds
[02:38:50] <manicennui> Wait, thin air
[02:39:03] <skyl4rk> gamer vacuum
[02:39:10] <manicennui> Yeah.
[02:40:31] <skyl4rk> buy the set: can of compressed air for cleaning out your computer, can of vacuum to increase network speed and gaming performance
[02:41:18] <skyl4rk> chance to win a scratch and sniff nft
[02:42:38] <Brekkjern> Hehe
[02:43:39] <Brekkjern> Fun fact, converting network signals to light in fiberoptics also has a significant latency
[02:44:25] <skyl4rk> sure, the beacons of gondor takes some stoking
[02:44:25] <Brekkjern> High frequency trading networks usually rely on microwave to get their signals there faster than their competitors
[02:45:01] <Brekkjern> This is usually not really a problem for normal deployments :P
[02:45:56] <skyl4rk> doubt that's because the transmission speed of the medium as such, but more that fiber goes through switches and stuff each adding its own little amount of latency, whereas microwave is direct line of sight
[02:46:30] <Brekkjern> It's actually because the light bounces inside the fiber, meaning the path the light has to take is longer than the length of the cable
[02:46:55] <manicennui> I imagine installation is also super expensive.
[02:47:17] <Brekkjern> For fiber or radio?
[02:50:35] <Brekkjern> Fiber is probably the most expensive as you have to dig a trench in as straight a line as possible, while radio can be put on rooftops
[02:50:40] <skyl4rk> are you saying that the difference in speed between a point-to-point fiber link and a microwave link is big enough that it matters for hft? If so that's amazing, in a kind of disgusting way (since I'm not fond of the finance market)
[02:53:02] <skyl4rk> from what I understand the main argument against wired telecom infrastructure (in the US) is the land ownership laws, it's much more difficult to decide to build infrastructure than <lots of other places>
[02:54:57] <Brekkjern> Not all that familiar with US law, but your first message there is correct
[02:55:27] <manicennui> Brekkjern: For fiber.
[02:55:43] <Brekkjern> Also, fiber links are rarely straight. They are often routed through nodes which makes the distance much longer than radio
[02:55:53] <skyl4rk> me either, but it's related to $work in a distant cousin kind of way
[02:56:24] <Brekkjern> Radio is a very cheap tech in most cases, but it can also be influenced by a lot of factors you won't have proper control of
[02:57:21] <Brekkjern> It doesn't really work like lasers do. It is actually a field that takes up space between the two ends of the system, which means you need proper space around the "beam"
[02:57:36] <Brekkjern> I think it's called Fresnel lensing, but I'm not 100% on that
[02:58:12] <Brekkjern> Radio is one of those things I looked at and thought I didn't want to really learn. Kinda regret it now because the physics are pretty cool
[02:59:25] <skyl4rk> dunno, I'm not in the physics side of it, but from my studies that included radio, it's basically like everything in physics, that if you place something far away enough you can ignore its effect
[03:00:02] <skyl4rk> don't remember fresnel lensing as a term, but I only took the required basics
[03:00:45] <Brekkjern> I didn't have to know as I just did network engineering, but we were shown the systems and given a very rudimentary introduction to it
[03:01:18] <Brekkjern> Ah. It's Fresnel zone. Not lensing
[03:02:12] <Brekkjern> I always get the terms confused... Fresnel did a lot of stuff it seems
[03:02:14] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_Networks
[03:02:14] <buttsbot> Spread Networks - Wikipedia
[03:05:38] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I'd imagine that the practicality of fiber wins out at some point
[03:06:09] <Brekkjern> If you can get it going in straight enough lines, then it might be easier than dealing with obstructions for radio
[03:07:12] <skyl4rk> reading the first parts of fresnel zones on wikipedia I can say that it is not a topic that was covered, but from what I know about constructive and destructive interference, and propagation paths I can at least go "hmm, yes, makes sense"
[03:07:26] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[03:07:55] <skyl4rk> it's not even specific to the dark magic that is radio
[03:08:03] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[03:08:15] <Brekkjern> It seems a lot of this is kinda universal in physics

[03:10:00] <prussian> I still worked today though, (at home lol)
[03:10:34] <skyl4rk> I comb and I comb
[03:20:17] <ngoldbaum> skyl4rk: not really radio specific, just optics, lighthouse lenses are fresnel lenses
[03:20:41] <skyl4rk> yep
[03:20:58] <skyl4rk> the ones in your common burglary alarm motion detector as well
[03:21:23] <skyl4rk> and glued to the back window of many buses
[03:21:37] <skyl4rk> or at least used to be
[03:22:16] <skyl4rk> it's all about the surface angle of attack heh
[03:29:09] <prussian> Light houses sometimes too
[03:29:12] <prussian> I mean
[03:29:16] <prussian> Greenhouses
[03:55:42] <manicennui> And outhouses

[19:08:14] <gerikson1> this static vs dynamic post is dumb
[19:11:51] <riv> yes
[19:58:03] <imode> if you're anywhere in the pacific, please observe your local tsunami warnings.
[20:02:45] <pja> imode: Drowning bad.
[20:03:30] <gerikson1> jfc
[20:07:50] <imode> less than a meter observed in alaska, but japan is gonna get hit with a 3 meter tsunami.
[20:08:59] <ngoldbaum> scary
[20:09:05] <ngoldbaum> thankfully japan is pretty prepared for that
[20:09:39] <ngoldbaum> i remember when the tohoku earthquake happened and a bunch of boats got wrecked in the santa cruz marina
[20:12:17] <jlindgren> 3...meters?? thats horrifying
[20:17:15] <gwozniak> gerikson1: yes, that post is really dumb
[20:25:58] <gwozniak> Just reading about this volcanic eruption now. Wow.
[20:57:41] <gerikson1> gwozniak: MovableType had its data in a DB, but it wrote out content to files before serving them
[20:57:46] <gerikson1> static or dynamic?
[20:58:01] <gerikson1> and that was in frickin' 2005 or something
[20:58:35] <gerikson1> huh took a while for this crap to slither over from HN to here https://lobste.rs/s/fojdfg
[20:58:36] <buttsbot> Is the madness ever going to end? | Lobsters
[21:02:05] <imode> not until someone arrives with a better "web".
[21:04:26] <gwozniak> Can't decide if I'm going to flag or hide
[21:05:28] <gwozniak> Because it's just a garbage post
[21:15:55] <gwozniak> I would love to actually talk to someone like this person and confront them on what they think a solution would actually be
[21:16:16] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[21:16:17] <gwozniak> Guaranteed they would not have a useful or even remotely practical answer
[21:16:51] <imode> I agree with him except for the existing infra worship. the web sucks.
[21:16:57] <imode> and it sucked before node.
[21:17:25] <gwozniak> Yeah, it sucks.  Everything sucks.  That's how it works
[21:17:45] <imode> it really shouldn't be how it works. native apps should be the thing we're doing.
[21:18:07] <imode> defeatism and acceptance of bullshit is how we got here.
[21:18:08] <gwozniak> We'd be complaining just as much, although I agree that I'd rather use native apps
[21:18:22] <imode> the problem is that building a native app sucks so fucking hard.
[21:19:00] <gwozniak> But the amusing part is that it doesn't seem to be a whole lot better or easier with webapps
[21:19:12] <imode> you can at least write some HTML and have it "work".
[21:19:30] <imode> it's a file your browser can execute, that's _something_.
[21:19:48] <imode> to get a similar experience you need a word processor.
[21:20:01] <imode> and the experience isn't the same.
[21:20:20] <imode> like, my wife could write some HTML. she can't write the equivalent native windows/*nix app.
[21:20:45] <imode> 'doze got close with visual basic and their form designer, I will say that.
[21:21:09] <gwozniak> Which is what the "worse is better" essay gets at, and it's something that will probably always happen
[21:21:43] <imode> worse is better applies when programmers don't dog food their shit.
[21:21:49] <imode> if you aren't using it, who gives a shit.
[21:22:16] <imode> if you aren't suffering because of some inane requirements, who gives a shit.
[21:22:36] <imode> if nothing is affecting the developer directly, they will not care about how well their software performs for other people.
[21:22:41] <gwozniak> Worse is Better talks about "getting something that sort of works" always winning over "getting something right"
[21:22:51] <imode> extend that to corporations and you have "why is all of the things we ship shit".
[21:23:15] <imode> yeah. because "getting something that sort of works" is a beneficial option when you don't have to account for outside consequences.
[21:23:37] <imode> nobody's going to give a shit if I complain that a 2D game drops to 3 FPS on my T430.
[21:23:47] <imode> because the developer doesn't work on underpowered laptops.
[21:24:00] <imode> despite the fact that it's totally possible for it to run on my machine if they got it _right_.
[21:24:29] <imode> when you are disconnected from consequences in usability and performance as a developer, you can write any code and accept anything.
[21:25:51] <imode> there are two ways you can induce change. create a large enough market share to complain about thing X, inducing change Y by threat of monetary loss, or change/fix it yourself.
[21:27:04] <imode> so if this dude is pissed off, try getting everyone experiencing performance issues to speak up in a counter campaign against various non-native electron apps from large services.
[21:27:08] <imode> or build your own damn web.
[21:27:50] <gwozniak> The thing is most people don't really care that much.  They just put up with it.
[21:28:13] <imode> hence why option B is more achievable than option A. 'tis a sick irony.
[21:28:17] <gwozniak> My wife doesn't even let me complain about things on her behalf anymore
[21:29:12] <imode> apathy is the number one problem for humans these days.
[21:29:34] <gwozniak> It's more that they care about other things more
[21:30:51] <gwozniak> This, I believe, is the mistake those trying to change how we program computers are making: not many people really want to program their machines to do custom things
[21:31:31] <imode> treat open systems as if you're designing for disability.
[21:31:53] <gwozniak> So even if you come up with a more accessible way to program, I don't think it will matter much
[21:32:43] <gwozniak> fyi: I don't mean accessible in the sense of those with disabilities
[21:33:12] <imode> yeah I know, just that it's a good marker. someone needs to be able to hook up something weird to your stuff eventually.
[21:33:17] <imode> to foster their needs.
[21:33:25] <imode> treat it as serious as designing for disability.
[22:03:55] <manicennui> https://i.redd.it/mjnaaqeanub81.png
[22:05:07] <gwozniak> I will be skeptical on that exchange, but it is totally plausible
[22:06:07] <manicennui> It's definitely parody.
[22:06:40] <gwozniak> I know very little about Rogan, aside from the fact he's overblown
[22:07:29] <manicennui> He was occasionally entertaining in the past, but always had some crazies on his shows.
[22:07:45] <manicennui> Now his guests seem to be mostly assholes.
[22:07:47] <gwozniak> The little I have heard of his podcast tells me that I will not want to spend my time listening to it
[22:07:53] <manicennui> And he always pushes his biases.
[22:08:09] <manicennui> gwozniak: It can be good when he has a really good guest on who does almost all of the talking.
[22:08:38] <manicennui> The Daryl Davis episode is my go to recommendation to see what it could be.
[22:10:25] <imode> I'll spare exposing myself to that fucking nut-head douchebag's voice and providing him views/listens.
[22:10:50] <manicennui> I wish I knew of another great interview with Daryl Davis.
[22:11:32] <manicennui> One of the good parts about his podcast, and others, is that they'll just let people talk for hours.
[22:11:52] <manicennui> Nothing has to be soundbites that fit in between commercial breaks.
[22:12:18] <manicennui> Much shorter video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw

[22:12:25] <manicennui> Also very different tone.
[22:15:55] <imode> damn.
[22:16:18] <manicennui> He tells tons of stories on Rogan's podcast and gives lots of background.
[22:16:23] <manicennui> His life is pretty nuts.
[22:16:30] <manicennui> And he is a good musician as well.

[22:17:29] <buttsbot> Daryl Davis | Amazing Boogie Performance - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHM7qwOHskM
[22:18:25] <manicennui> He tells a story on Rogan's podcast about playing in a band at redneck bar and his playing sparked the interest of a local racist.
[22:18:44] <manicennui> Guy said he didn't think black people could play like that.
[22:22:07] <manicennui> He has a bunch of robes and hoods from people who left the Klan.
[22:23:13] <imode> this dude is most likely successful because he is.. well, successful. you don't kill someone like him that has a name for himself, even in just a few states, without getting caught, even if you are a klansman.
[22:24:47] <manicennui> I think people just genuinely like him.
[22:24:54] <manicennui> And it confuses them.
[22:25:16] <manicennui> Must... hate...
