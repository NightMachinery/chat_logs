[06:24:59] <isekaijin> Hello. Let f : X -> Y be surjective open morphism of varieties. (A variety is an integral scheme of finite type over a field.)
[06:25:10] <isekaijin> Then, in particular, f sends the generic point of X to the generic point of Y.
[06:25:56] <isekaijin> Errr, no wait, I am getting confused in the formulation of my question.
[06:26:04] <Guest59> uh, hm, I've only heard of varieties of ideals of polynomials
[06:27:26] <isekaijin> Consider yourself blessed. No need to deal with this scheme nonsense.
[06:28:42] <isekaijin> I am only using scheme nonsense because I want to reduce my problems to raw commutative algebra.
[06:29:30] <isekaijin> And the theorems you can find in any commutative algebra book (e.g., going-up, going-down) work better if you use schemes. You need the funny generic points.
[06:29:46] <Guest59> hm, well, sorry then as I won't be any help to you
[06:29:57] <isekaijin> It is okay. :)
[06:30:17] <Guest59> I'm still not really sure why anyone would care about algebraic geometry

[06:32:04] <isekaijin> The main reason is that it is beautiful. It is undisturbed by ugly compromises with the “real” (hehe!) world such as bump functions, or functions that are smooth but not analytic, etc.

[07:57:33] <cuppajoeman> I understand this
[07:58:09] <Batzy> well ok
[07:58:21] <devcpu> Batzy: if he was to prove that sqrt(7) is not rational, would he change the assumption about c?
[07:58:54] <Batzy> you could prove that in a very similar way as to what he's doing here
[07:59:26] <Batzy> it's not an assumption about c, btw
[07:59:42] <Batzy> he's saying if m and n have a common factor (which he calls c) then ...
[07:59:58] <Batzy> the gist of this one is he's using WOP to say this m exists
[08:00:35] <Batzy> that combined with the assumption that sqrt(2) is rational means you can pick some minimal m for which sqrt(2) = m/n
[08:00:37] <isekaijin> To prove that sqrt(7) is not rational, you use the fact that Z is factorial, hence normal, hence Q does not contain square roots of any elements that are not already squares in Z.

[08:02:58] <int-e> Which btw is an actual trap for cranks... they write gibberish and expect it to be taken for serious math.
[08:04:20] <int-e> so... factorial ring is another name for a unique factorization domain. now what's normal...
[08:04:29] <Batzy> int-e: oh it is?
[08:05:30] <Batzy> int-e: "define a normal ring to be a ring whose localizations at prime ideals are integrally closed domains."
[08:06:19] <isekaijin> Actually, what I meant is “factorial = uniquely factorization domain” and “normal = integrally closed domain”, but “factorial” and “normal” sound way cooler.
[08:06:32] <isekaijin> unique*
[08:07:01] <Batzy> im not sure why you'd know that, and then also be unsure about the proof of the irrationality of sqrt(2)
[08:07:41] <Batzy> since "integrally closed domain" is like, a little bit into undergrad algebra but the other thing is very early elementary number theoryu
[08:08:07] <isekaijin> “Z is a unique factorization domain” goes all the way back to Euclid.
[08:08:22] <isekaijin> Cannot get more elementary than that.
[08:08:42] <isekaijin> Since elementary methods is all that the ancient Greeks had.
[08:09:07] <Batzy> I would disagree with you
[08:09:18] <cuppajoeman> Ok I stared long at the limit, I thilnk that the limit "lim h -> 0  (f(x + h) - f(x) - h f'(x))/h = 0" means that our approximation: f(x + h) - f(x) - h f'(x) is going to zero faster than h is going to zero is that right?

[08:15:14] <cuppajoeman> So df_a is taking the place of hf'(x)
[08:15:44] <cuppajoeman> They don't actually define what it is, but I feel like we should know how to construct it right?
[08:15:58] <Batzy> they do define what it is
[08:16:16] <isekaijin> There is no universal recipe for constructing df_a.
[08:16:16] <Batzy> it's something that minimizes that limit, pretty much
[08:16:41] <isekaijin> You just have to be lucky that f is an easy enough function that you can sort of see what df_a could be like.
[08:17:00] <cuppajoeman> how are they defining it here? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/65SRF70u/image.png
[08:17:46] <Batzy> cuppajoeman: it's a linear transformation that minimizes that limit
[08:17:47] *** Quits: Trigo (~NeedMathH@64.201.115.44) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[08:17:51] <cuppajoeman> Right
[08:18:18] <cuppajoeman> How did they know this was the right definition of differentiable in multi variable
[08:18:41] <int-e> they took inspiration from "lim h -> 0  (f(x + h) - f(x) - h f'(x))/h = 0"
[08:18:51] <isekaijin> There were probably lots of false starts.
[08:19:20] <Batzy> i dont get it
[08:19:24] <Batzy> oh it is multivariable
[08:19:24] <Batzy> i see
[08:19:25] <isekaijin> Doubtlessly someone tried the “obvious” (and sadly wrong) definition where f is differentiable if all the partial derivatives exist.
[08:19:29] <int-e> you just replace h f'(x) by a linear map... and then you show that this is reasonable
[08:19:50] <int-e> in particular that the map df_a is unique when it exists
[08:20:17] <cuppajoeman> How did they know you would be replacing h f'(x) by a linear map though?
[08:20:22] <cuppajoeman> it could have been anything?
[08:20:31] <isekaijin> cuppajoeman: The whole point to derivatives is finding linear approximations.
[08:20:38] <PlanckWalk> h f'(x) *is* a linear map
[08:20:42] <isekaijin> Why linear? Because linear is easier than anything else.
[08:20:43] <int-e> cuppajoeman: sometimes you just have to try and get lucky
[08:20:50] <cuppajoeman> Ok
[08:22:20] <cuppajoeman> https://i.imgur.com/hlKLdhd.png so here this was a linear function and then I was able to figure out that alpha was f'(bar(x))

[08:24:03] <int-e> cuppajoeman: you can fix components of h to be 0

[08:24:42] <devcpu> int-e: Batzy: i am confused =) but i am trying to get less confused, just watched a proof by contradiction instead of wop, that sqrt(2) is not rational, and that was an easy one to understand
[08:26:33] <cuppajoeman> In the limit or how?
[08:28:28] <devcpu> Batzy: if he was to proof that sqrt(16) is rational would he still assume that m is the smallest?

[08:49:55] <int-e> devcpu: sqrt(7) is just the same as sqrt(2), you start with sqrt(7) = m/n with m minimal, then show that 7 divides m, then show that 7 divides n as well, and that's the end because sqrt(7) = (m/7) / (n/7) would have a smaller numerator

[15:07:29] <Z-module> hmm
[15:08:10] <rubiksdream> i have a way to see it, but i think it is too complicated, my idea was note that P has finitely many critical values, so assuming some point in a bounded component of C U {infinity} - D is sent to the unbounded component of C U {infinity} - E, we can lift a path in the unbounded component from that image point to some other point not hit by P from the bounded component, this path must enter P^{-1}(E), which is impossible

[17:55:46] <Z-module> because it sends each component to a connected set, and a connected set is a subset of one component
[17:56:42] <rubiksdream> yes, but why is it the entire component?
[17:57:01] <rubiksdream> it is certainly a connected subset of the entire connected component

[17:58:06] <rubiksdream> (without invoking some complicated argument)
[17:58:28] <Z-module> f sends f^-1(E) onto E, so f being surjective on X means it sends f^-1(X\E) onto all of X\E since none of those points can get sent to a point of E

[18:04:09] <rubiksdream> im not sure where this is going
[18:04:57] <Z-module> so it sends f^-1(E) onto all of E, and it sends each component of C^ \ f^-1(E) into some component of C^ \ E , so the *only* way f can be surjective overall is if it sends each component of C^ \ f^-1(E) onto some full component of C^ \ E

[18:10:44] <rubiksdream> in other words, what precludes f sending one of the bounded components , say b_1 to the unbounded component
[18:11:07] <Z-module> if E = {z : Re(z) = 0 or 1/n for some natural n while |Im(z)| <= 1,  or,   Im(z) = 0 or 1/n for some natural n while |Re(z)| <= 1 }, then E is compact, and it has countably infinitely many disjoint interior square regions in its complement.
[18:11:49] <Z-module> I mean 0 <= Im(z) < 1,   0 <= Re(z) <= 1,  in there
[18:12:43] <rubiksdream> what im saying is, suppose X - f^{-1}(E) has countably infinitely many bounded components, and the same for X - E. For the former let the bounded components be {b_1,....} and the latter {c_1,...} , say f maps b_2 surjectively onto c_1, b_3 surjectively onto c_2, etc, and f maps b_1 into the unbounded component of X - E, and of course f maps the unbounded component of X - f^{-1}(E) into the unbounded component of X - E
[18:13:06] <rubiksdream> then f(b_1) U f(unbounded component of X - f^{-1}(E)) = unbounded component of X - E

[18:13:22] <rubiksdream> and f(unbounded component of X - f^{-1}(E)) need not be the entire unbounded component of X - E
[18:13:24] <rubiksdream> do you see what I mean?

[18:58:56] <loller_> I'm not sure I follow
[18:59:10] <rubiksdream> okay, the one-simplex is a subset of R^2
[18:59:13] <loller_> so if that line segment's components do satisfy the requirements
[18:59:18] <rubiksdream> to specify a subset of R^2, you specify its points

[18:59:27] <rubiksdream> its points are 2-tuples, (x_0,x_1)

[19:13:20] <loller_> that's where I get myself confused I think
[19:14:11] <isekaijin> If you set 0 <= x_i <= 1, you get a cube, not a simplex.

[19:14:33] <loller_> and x_2 the extent along the unit vector e_2
[19:14:33] <rubiksdream> yes
[19:14:35] <loller_> or projection I should say

[19:15:34] <loller_> yeah but now I wonder where I started doing that lol
[19:15:40] <loller_> oh right the Wiki definition uses that
[19:15:44] <loller_> and I went with that first
[19:16:01] <isekaijin> Anyhow, let's do it in 2D first.
[19:16:07] <isekaijin> x, y >= 0 and x + y <= 1
[19:16:23] <isekaijin> Clearly you get a right triangle with vertices at (0,0), (0,1) and (1,0).
[19:16:56] <isekaijin> (By “triangle”, I mean “including the inside”, not just the contour, of course.)
[19:17:13] <loller_> well I see how if the unit simplex is the line segment joining (1,0) and (0,1), and x_1 and x_2 are the respective components of the points along that line segment (the position vectors describing them)
[19:17:27] <loller_> then the inequality x_1 + x_2 <= 1 applies
[19:17:41] <loller_> or actually the equality x_1 + x_2 = 1 I guess if u go with the normal definition
[19:18:05] <loller_> isekaijin: right, and that's actually my 1-simplex right?
[19:18:28] <isekaijin> If you use the segment x + y = 1, then you get a 1-simplex.
[19:18:30] <loller_> only that we  are now also considering the area between it and the axes
[19:18:40] <loller_> right
[19:18:44] <isekaijin> If you consider the area between it and the axes, you get a 2-simplex.
[19:18:53] <loller_> and then we go to x + y + z = 1, we get the 2-simplex
[19:19:02] <loller_> that we see here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex#/media/File:2D-simplex.svg
[19:19:07] <isekaijin> Yes, and the area between it and the coordinate hyperplanes is a 3-simplex.

[19:32:31] <loller_> but I would like for it to be shown how
[19:32:36] <loller_> even if just a glimpse
[19:32:44] <loller_> it shouldn't be something that's shown to u 3 years later
[19:32:58] <riv> so f(X)/(X-3) = (X^2 + 3X + 4)(X^2 - 3)
[19:33:01] <loller_> especially since this destroys the beauty of math in my opinion
[19:33:12] <loller_> the incredible thing is how everything is tied together
[19:33:16] <loller_> and not disjoint at all
[19:33:21] <riv> let define g(X) = (X^2 + 3X + 4)(X^2 - 3)
[19:33:30] <riv> the splitting field of f is the same as the splitting field of g
[19:33:31] <loller_> but this is not how math is taught in the West, at least not anymore

[19:34:37] <riv> rex_victor: so this makes it a bit easier, we can add a sqrt(3) to our finite field, to get F_25 and then we can just check if X^2 + 3X + 4 splits or not

[19:34:50] <loller_> I have to find some way to reconcile with his style

[19:35:53] <rex_victor> riv: yeah
[19:36:16] <riv> this is basically the same as that, L = F_5[w]/(w^2 - 3)

[19:36:34] <rex_victor> riv: how do I know the 25?
[19:36:43] <rex_victor> because it's a quadratic?

[19:37:19] <loller_> In some approaches to quantum gravity, such as Regge calculus and causal dynamical triangulations, simplices are used as building blocks of discretizations of spacetime; that is, to build simplicial manifolds.
[19:37:22] <loller_> there we go I guess
[19:37:35] <riv> it's size 25 because every element is of the form  a + w b

[19:37:47] <loller_> Regge calculus sounds familiar
[19:37:51] <riv> so we can list all 25 elements, we can add and multiply them

[19:39:55] <riv> this is tedious because there are 25 of them to check
[19:40:14] <riv> but there are 2 roots, so it does split - so the splitting field is just F_25
[19:40:52] <rex_victor> riv: ok so the elements a + wb, I can treat them as a + b sqrt(3) mod 5 right?
[19:41:05] <riv> yes
[19:41:09] <rex_victor> so e.g. (bw)2 = 3b^2 ?
[19:41:16] <riv> that's right
[19:41:48] <riv> you have to be careful when taking square roots in finite fields though, half of the square roots already exist
[19:42:44] <rex_victor> ok so I'm starting to understand it
[19:42:47] <riv> e.g. sqrt(3) is not in F_7, but sqrt(2) is (3^2 = 4^2 = 2 mod 7)
[19:43:40] <rex_victor> coming back to the definition of L
[19:44:09] <rex_victor> strictly speaking, it's elements are polynoms + the ideal generated by (w^2 - 3)
[19:44:32] <rex_victor> so f + (w^2 - 3) e.g. right?
[19:45:13] <riv> that's true, it is a polynomial ring quotiented by an idea
[19:45:15] <riv> ideal*
[19:45:24] <riv> but it's ok to call the thing sqrt(3)
[19:45:36] <rex_victor> yeah because of isomorphy

[19:45:53] <riv> you may also write  blah blah mod (5, w^2-3)

[19:46:11] <riv> it's not exactly an isomorphism
[19:46:17] <riv> there is no ring F_5[sqrt(3)]
[19:46:25] <riv> it's an abuse of notation
[19:46:31] <riv> it's one that we can get away with

[21:46:11] <dude12312414> yes
[21:46:15] <cuppajoeman> Because given some basis element of the box topology it looks like (j, k) x (p, q) and so the inverse image of it is this rectangle scaled in some way
[21:48:35] <Z-module> there's an edge case when ab = 0, but in those cases, inverse images of open rectangles are either infinite open strips or all of R^2
[21:48:47] <Z-module> so it all works out

[21:50:46] <cuppajoeman> how does it change it?

[21:53:08] <dude12312414> yeah
[21:53:36] <HenryTheLongshot> Z-module: ahhh I see that's clever. Yeah taking log of both sides yields log(a) * log(b)

[22:02:56] <newpy> I'm not sure why this is the case
[22:03:07] <qergle> why ambiguous?
[22:03:37] <cuppajoeman> To show the function f(x1, x2, x3, ... ) = (a1 x1, a2 x2, a3 x3, ... ) is continuous in the box topology we would take an arbitrary basis element of the box topology and check if the inverse image of that set is open right?
[22:03:44] <newpy> qergle, https://youtu.be/wfr4XbR5VP8?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60UlabZBeeqOuoLuj_KNphQ&t=202
[22:03:46] <dude12312414> cuppajoeman: ok actually your example should be continuous in the box topology too.
[22:03:52] <dude12312414> And yeah to check this from scratch, you'd look at an arbitrary basis set around (y1, ..., yn, ...) which looks like (y1 - e1, y1 + e1) x ... x (yn - en, yn + en) x ...
[22:04:10] <dude12312414> for some positive e1, ..., en
[22:04:26] <qergle> newpy: ok, in x^2+1=0, what does the quadratic formula give?
[22:05:06] <Z-module> newpy, well, here, a = 1, b = 0, c = 1, so the quadratic formula  -b/2 +/- sqrt(4ac - b^2)  amounts to just  +/- sqrt(-1).  But "sqrt" isn't defined as a single value for arguments other than non-negative reals. It doesn't matter, though, because the only two complex numbers having sqaure = -1 are i and -i.
[22:05:10] <dude12312414> the preimage is just the product of these rescaled intervals (or R if an = 0) and all of those are basis neighborhoods in the box topology so it works out
[22:05:11] <qergle> a=1,b=0,c=1. so ±(sqrt(-4)/2, yes?
[22:05:11] <newpy> (0 +/- sqrt(0 - 4))/2
[22:05:20] <dude12312414> so yeah exactly the same argument
[22:05:22] <cuppajoeman> dude12312414:  Whats the y = (y1, ..., yn, ... ) point for?
[22:05:29] <Z-module>  I forgot the /2 under the sqrt....
[22:05:30] <qergle> newpy: right. and sqrt(-4)=2*sqrt(-1)
[22:05:35] <cuppajoeman> I thought we just take some basis element?
[22:05:38] <cuppajoeman> Not around some point
[22:05:46] <dude12312414> i mean any point in the image, like f(x1, ..., xn, ...) = (y1, ..., yn, ...)
[22:05:48] <newpy> yesqergle, sure
[22:05:52] <dude12312414> but yeah
[22:05:56] <qergle> so you end up with ±sqrt(-1) which is ±i
[22:05:57] <dude12312414> actually that's irrelevant
[22:06:12] <qergle> the +sqrt(-1) corresponds to +i, and likewise the other.
[22:06:41] <dude12312414> the reason i got confused is that some facts about products work when you use the product topology but not the box topology
[22:06:43] <newpy> qergle, ok but he says it's ambiguous "which" formula results in which root
[22:07:06] <newpy> as in b^2 + 2*sqrt(-1) could be -i?

[23:13:34] <loller_> in the sense of "common" or "unproblematic"
[23:13:54] <loller_> "Normalbereich" would have the same translation more or less
[23:14:49] <loller_> it bugs me though that there is seemingly no English language equivalent that I can find though since I want to connect it to what I am reading elsewhere in English
[23:15:33] <loller_> rather than "smooth" functions I should say continuous btw
[23:16:00] <joel135> Seems like it is called "simple domain"
[23:17:25] <loller_> I can't find any mention of that term online however

[23:17:40] <loller_> as far as I can tell this is a specifically German line of reasoning
[23:17:53] <loller_> and the theory is constructed in other ways in other places
