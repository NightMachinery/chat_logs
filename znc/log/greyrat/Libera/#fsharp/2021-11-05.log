[15:40:27] <MatthiasVance> biberu: I get what you mean with regards to the Seq.rev, next step should be to read backwards instead
[15:41:32] <MatthiasVance> So: state |> Seq.unfold fillSomeBuffer |> Seq.collect Seq.rev will load all buffers
[15:41:39] <MatthiasVance> that is bad
[15:41:40] <MatthiasVance> :D
[15:41:58] * biberu downloads more ram
[15:42:41] <MatthiasVance> I would love to be able to profile this on a code line level
[15:42:49] <MatthiasVance> Like, see what is happening allocation wise etc
[15:43:07] <MatthiasVance> Maybe I should step through it when testing
[15:43:12] <MatthiasVance> And check allocations
[15:43:32] <MatthiasVance> The standard diagnostic tooling in VS seems .. not necessarily very easy to use
[15:49:39] <lind{at}yahoo> morning MatthiasVance 
[15:52:58] <MatthiasVance> morning lind{at}yahoo, how are you?
[15:53:23] <lind{at}yahoo> great, did you see the poem I wrote for jennifershareshuman?
[15:54:57] <MatthiasVance> I did, it was nice. One note: I don't get the second line
[16:00:55] <lind{at}yahoo> which line?
[16:03:14] <lind{at}yahoo> btw it was inspired by her video: https://www.tiktok.com/@jennifershareshuman/video/6934798428325121286?lang=en&is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=7023484900557325830
[16:06:12] <MatthiasVance> lind{at}yahoo: The first two lines talk about how being 1 is strong, but also how being together is 1, in that regard I find them conflicting. The rest of the poem continues on the "1 is strong" part I feel
[16:06:19] <MatthiasVance> Can't watch the video right now
[16:07:12] <lind{at}yahoo> I'm saying one is so much more than strong: it is whole
[16:09:12] <lind{at}yahoo> Jen and I are both very strong people, conceptually we don't need anyone else. And she's not sold that she wants any romantic relationships anymore, while she's on good terms with her ex-husband she is doubtful about going down that path again. But my argument is that we are so much more together than apart
[16:10:08] <lind{at}yahoo> we've been very romantic, but we hit some bumps and she tried to friendzone me, but its been slowly moving back in the other direction the last few weeks
[16:17:15] <MatthiasVance> Ahh, yeah
[16:17:28] <MatthiasVance> I hope it will keep moving in the right direction
[16:19:58] <lind{at}yahoo> I think it will

[20:24:01] <indomitable> I hope this won't turn into one of those "stalker" stories
[20:24:07] <indomitable> getting serious stalkery vibes

[20:41:19] <biberu> O_o
[20:42:24] <indomitable> i didn't click any of the links. Is lind{at}yahoo into magic rocks?
[20:42:27] <indomitable> that is another danger flag
[20:47:41] <biberu> that site appears to be into people that are into magic rocks at least
[20:55:55] <indomitable> biberu, you're too young, you don't recognize the signs of crazy yet
[20:55:57] <indomitable> one day you willl
[20:55:58] <indomitable> -l
[21:02:52] <indomitable> biberu, did you read all the pratchett things i told you to yet
[21:12:01] <lind{at}yahoo> indomitable: the semi-precious stones have a nice story, I bought the neckless because I thought Jen would like the looks of it, but she will really enjoy the history behind it too
[21:18:08] <indomitable> i really hope you don't murder her and wear her skin

[22:25:27] <indomitable> :O
[22:41:44] <biberu> i'm busy with dentists and animal bites today
[22:42:20] <biberu> i wasn't bitten by a cephalopod
[22:50:20] <biberu> (not a dentist either)

[23:23:42] <indomitable> endothermic?
[23:23:46] <indomitable> uhhh
[23:23:48] <indomitable> seems implausible
[23:31:06] <biberu> it's a star trek reference :)

[23:31:52] <indomitable> hmm why are mammals "endothermic"; I thought endothermic things didn't hear their environment
[23:31:56] <indomitable> heat'
[23:33:00] <indomitable> (like an endothermic reaction - takes energy from its surroundings)
