[07:59:01] <relejek[m]> supp. hope you guys had a good night's sleep
[07:59:11] <iamak[m]> When I start my computer, dwm always takes a minute (approx) to load all the windows for the first time, including dwm bar. I think it is a cache issue but idk for sure. Does anyone know how to fix it?
[08:00:54] <Arya[m]> X issue?
[08:00:54] <Arya[m]> try starting different window manager
[08:00:54] <Arya[m]> or vanilla dwm
[08:01:28] <iamak[m]> I use vanilla dwm only
[08:01:57] <iamak[m]> No patches 
[08:07:55] <Arya[m]> oh
[08:08:03] <Arya[m]> try git cloning the rpeo
[08:08:15] <Arya[m]> maybe there was issue that was fixeed
[08:08:28] <iamak[m]> Okay. I should have thought of this lol
[08:08:38] <Arya[m]> lol
[08:17:15] <iamak[m]> Didn't work
[08:30:04] <Zbnssn[m]> <Arya[m]1> "leftist privacy?" <- Leftist as in they dont support authoritative regime, the government controlling and spying on us and then selling our personal data to companies who manipulate us to buying their products
[08:34:16] <Arya[m]> having fidel castro as their picture doesnt help the message they are trying to send 😆
[08:35:15] <Zbnssn[m]> never seen anyone like that tbh, your painting your own foe and complaining
[08:35:53] <Zbnssn[m]> Lol I remember this one Google Open Source webinar our college told me to join
[08:35:54] <Zbnssn[m]> hosted on cringe zoom platform
[08:36:25] <Zbnssn[m]> All were 3rd/4th year college stus One was working w Redhat
[08:36:25] <Zbnssn[m]> I asked him about FOSS/FLOSS
[08:36:41] <Zbnssn[m]> he said uhhh it's different from opensource FOSS is a political movement
[08:37:34] <iamak[m]> Yes
[08:37:55] <iamak[m]> FOSS, FLOSS, Free Software and Open Source are all different things
[08:38:13] <iamak[m]> Source: I have offended many people by using the wrong term xD
[08:38:40] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah I understand it now
[08:39:17] <Zbnssn[m]> even richard stallman was offended on being called Father of Open Source kek
[08:39:33] <iamak[m]> Lol
[08:40:12] <Zbnssn[m]> pretty much any opinion you have these days, is turned political and i hate the political compass memes so much it's so retarded "wow so ur this of the 4 colors"
[08:42:10] <iamak[m]> I just want software which I know for sure doesn't invade my privacy and can make changes to ¯_(ツ)_/¯
[08:43:31] <iamak[m]> s/¯/¯\\/
[08:43:38] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah really looking forward to web 3.0 where (hopefully) the evils of bigtech would cease to be
[08:43:54] <iamak[m]> Keep hoping xD
[08:44:02] <Zbnssn[m]> lol
[08:44:08] <iamak[m]> Whenever there is money to be made, it will be made
[08:44:38] <iamak[m]> Initial internet was like that but it has turned into modern internet

[11:16:31] <Arya[m]> you can always make a private federation for your friends and family for example pretty easily
[11:16:37] <Arya[m]> so 
[11:16:44] <Arya[m]> no metadata leakage
[11:16:50] <relejek[m]> if you really don't want someone else to control your communication host your own instance like Govindas  did. heck run your own home server on a r-pi.

[11:30:04] <palwd[m]> Ive heard they're very resource heavy
[11:30:25] <Sayon[m]> lol its not resource intensive
[11:30:35] <Sayon[m]> i ran a thinkpad server for 1 month or so
[11:30:51] <palwd[m]> Oo
[11:30:59] <Sayon[m]> connected ethernet and ubuntu
[11:34:26] <Govindas[m]> palwd[m]: my CPU usage is like 2% with that running and multiple other things
[11:34:56] <Govindas[m]> it's mostly internet intensive, CPU not so if you're the only user
[11:35:15] <Arya[m]> what about bots
[11:35:16] <Govindas[m]> if you're having issues, you can avoid joining rooms with more than 2000 members to reduce load
[11:35:25] <Arya[m]> you have port forwarding?
[11:35:34] <Govindas[m]> no, not needed
[11:35:41] <Govindas[m]> you can use cloudflared Argo tunnel
[11:35:50] <Arya[m]> with udp?
[11:35:53] <Govindas[m]> reduces privacy sadly
[11:35:53] <Arya[m]> doesnt matrix require udp
[11:35:59] <Arya[m]> can you share your argo config
[11:36:12] <Arya[m]> I want to try hosting a whatsapp bridge lol
[11:36:20] <palwd[m]> Yeah me too
[11:36:41] <palwd[m]> Ive given up on trying to get mu friends to switch to other alternatives
[11:36:41] <Govindas[m]> I don't know about that, it works for me
[11:36:48] <palwd[m]> So I thought of bridging
[11:37:04] <Govindas[m]> Arya[m]: sure, give me some minutes
[11:37:14] <Arya[m]> k
[11:37:38] <Arya[m]> you are using dendrite or synapse
[11:37:44] <Govindas[m]> synapse
[11:37:49] <Arya[m]> oh nice
[11:38:12] <palwd[m]> It would be good if gnulinuxindia hosted their own matrix server too right
[11:39:35] <Arya[m]> no
[11:39:40] <Arya[m]> discoveerability
[11:39:55] <Arya[m]> many spaces i have seen
[11:40:01] <Arya[m]> have one on matrix.org

[11:43:53] <Arya[m]> most people dont
[11:43:53] <Govindas[m]> a room/space does not belong to a single server, they're decentralized

[11:54:59] <Arya[m]> ig i dont have any excuse other than the vps pystardust got is too small to handle this \xD
[11:55:19] <palwd[m]> Lol
[11:55:55] <Arya[m]> ig i can use argo but then idt my cold and dead i3 4thgen can handle  100s of msgs a day
[11:56:18] <Arya[m]> Govindas: whats the specs of ur sever
[11:56:23] <palwd[m]> Wait even I've got a basic 5 dollar vps, so you're saying that even that won't be able to handle setting up a homeserver?
[11:56:27] <Govindas[m]> it's raspberry pi 400
[11:56:41] <Arya[m]> oh wow
[11:56:52] <Arya[m]> ig my pc can handle it
[11:56:54] <Arya[m]> 4 gigs or 8
[11:57:01] <Govindas[m]> but if you host for others, you will need A LOT of storage, fast internet
[11:57:08] <Govindas[m]> 4gb ram is the only model
[11:58:03] <Govindas[m]> my matrix synapse storage takes 8gb~ and I am the only user
[11:58:04] <Arya[m]> oh yeah forgot abt that
[11:58:13] <Arya[m]> i think 8 gig is only for rpi 4
[11:58:28] <palwd[m]> Govindas[m]: Wow that's a lot
[11:58:47] <Arya[m]> how big is your sd card
[11:58:52] <Govindas[m]> you can go around it by deleting old data, but I don't wanna lose anything, so I am going for keeping it permanently xD
[11:58:55] <Govindas[m]> I don't use sd card, ssd
[11:59:06] <duuooo[m]> Arya[m]: whats the spec
[11:59:12] <Arya[m]> I really dont want to dedicate my 256gig ssd for it
[11:59:22] <Govindas[m]> I have dedicated 256gb ssd to it
[11:59:24] <duuooo[m]> Arya[m]: wtf, it feels like they did it on purpose so people wont self host
[12:00:05] <duuooo[m]> Govindas[m]: .
[12:00:24] <Arya[m]> duuooo[m]: linode 5$
[12:00:29] <duuooo[m]> we should listen the boomer and skip matrix 
[12:00:32] <Govindas[m]> I personally haven't yet ran into situation where 4gb ram would be not enough for selfhosting all services I need
[12:00:33] <duuooo[m]> straight to xmpp
[12:00:34] <Arya[m]> duuooo[m]: xDD
[12:00:46] <Arya[m]> duuooo[m]: lo
[12:00:47] <Arya[m]> l
[12:00:52] <Arya[m]> Govindas[m]: holy
[12:01:28] <duuooo[m]> Arya[m]: i have the same one
[12:01:30] <duuooo[m]> http://0x0.st/-Fwe.png
[12:01:43] <duuooo[m]> good for smol tasks
[12:02:11] <Govindas[m]> by the way the 8gb accumulation is from running it for about 6 months
[12:02:52] <Govindas[m]> so with multiple users you're going to need either terabytes of storage or auto-deleting data that is older than x months
[12:03:03] <Arya[m]> oof
[12:03:15] <Arya[m]> i have a 1 tb hard drive but thats really loose connection
[12:04:02] <Govindas[m]> most space is taken by images/videos that have been sent to me throughout the time
[12:04:09] <Govindas[m]> then like 1/5 of that is messages
[12:05:48] <Arya[m]> oof
[12:05:58] <Arya[m]> can you make it autodelete images every month 
[12:06:01] <Arya[m]> btw
[12:06:04] <Arya[m]> try dendrie
[12:06:09] <Arya[m]> i have heard its way better
[12:06:19] <Arya[m]> *dendrite
[12:06:35] <duuooo[m]> Govindas[m]: wait, by 8gb did you mean ram or storage 
[12:06:53] <palwd[m]> Storage I think
[12:07:29] <Govindas[m]> yes storage
[12:07:36] <duuooo[m]> lol, that makes sense , i thought it was ram
[12:07:56] <Govindas[m]> I don't know how much ram it uses, but under 1gb I think
[12:08:26] <Arya[m]> oh oice
[12:08:49] <duuooo[m]> Arya[m]: linode $5 could do that
[12:10:43] <NeoVoid[m]> <iamak[m]> "When I start my computer, dwm..." <- same issue here.

[13:23:26] <relejek[m]> Neo Void: i am not sure, the site works just fine for me.
[13:25:08] <palwd[m]> gtlsgamr: Oo okie
[13:25:33] <NeoVoid[m]> relejek[m]: yes in plain firefox it just works fine
[13:25:38] <NeoVoid[m]> but in dot...........
[13:29:10] <Arya[m]> fuck dot
[13:29:13] <Arya[m]> use librewolf
[13:29:38] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: the git ui is fixed ?
[13:29:39] <Arya[m]> noice
[13:30:04] <Arya[m]> btw do you have a guide on using patches instead of PRs
[13:31:55] <pystardust> duuooo[m]: yeah, matrix is so heavy, we can host xmpp on the server we have rn. It would be nice if we get contributions for the server then we can have a bigger one, rn its shared hosting cheapest plan on linode
[13:32:54] <Arya[m]> https://github.com/alberthier/git-webui
[13:33:01] <Arya[m]> pystardust: this webui seems interesting
[13:34:14] <palwd[m]> pystardust @pystardust:libera.chat:  I'd be down to contribute
[13:35:05] <pystardust> Nice, we can have a webpage that shows contribution and how long the server will be supported with those contributions to be transparent
[13:35:44] <Arya[m]> noice
[14:39:21] <gtlsgamr> I'm willing to contribute. But once the site gains some traction. Suppose, we get at least 3 or 4 contributions in the form of content or something... Then we can do something to make it worthwhile.
[14:39:26] <gtlsgamr> What do you think pystardust?
[14:40:36] <pystardust> Yeah, we need to put up content and also could provide lightweight services like xmpp
[14:41:09] <gtlsgamr> So once some services comeup, I'll definitely give in my contribution
[14:41:30] <klimi[m]> if something doesnt work with xmpp you can hit me up... i host our faculty ejabberd instance

[14:53:06] <gtlsgamr> People! Please submit tutorials, guides, whatever little linux tid bit you find useful and we will post it on the site if it's at the least usable! No bar for quality, you know about the ls command? Make an article! New linux users will want that info! Make sure to make it informative so that people who visit will find it useful
[15:00:30] <klimi[m]> "No bar for quality".... why making article about ls? we already have man and tldr
[15:05:51] <gtlsgamr> You know it, we know it. New users might not know about those. Maybe an article about man pages or tldr
[15:05:54] <gtlsgamr> You get the gist
[15:06:18] <gtlsgamr> Let's try and not do elitism here
[15:19:06] <NeoVoid[m]> Is there any similar tool like jq to transform one line css into well organized way?
[15:21:21] <gtlsgamr> I think you can open it in vim and do gg=G
[15:25:59] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: didnt worked
[15:26:38] <gtlsgamr> NeoVoid[m]: you mean one line css or inline?
[15:27:27] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: look at this for example all one line no indentation or proper format
[15:27:43] <NeoVoid[m]> https://cdn.simplecss.org/simple.min.css
[15:28:46] <gtlsgamr> You don't want to use online tools I suppose?
[15:28:59] <gtlsgamr> This is minified css, you can unminify it using a number of online tools
[15:29:42] <gtlsgamr> NeoVoid[m]: here, this is your thing https://mrcoles.com/blog/command-line-css-unminifier-utility/
[15:31:03] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: wait minifying just means making it one liner? does that really helps or just for preventing peoples to copy it lol
[15:31:05] <NeoVoid[m]> * copy it? lol
[15:33:40] <klimi[m]> NeoVoid[m]: minifying means it tries to make it as small as possible => remove unnecessary spaces, newlines, replace long strings if possible etc
[15:34:27] <NeoVoid[m]> klimi[m]: so it doesnt have to do with page loading times right?
[15:34:31] <NeoVoid[m]> s/times/time/
[15:34:37] <klimi[m]> shouldn't
[15:34:44] <klimi[m]> i mean... it tries to optimize bandwidth
[15:34:54] <klimi[m]> not necessary performance
[15:41:11] <NeoVoid[m]> <klimi[m]> "i mean... it tries to optimize..." <- ohh may be its better to minify it after editing i guess.
[15:41:51] <NeoVoid[m]> <gtlsgamr> "Neo Void: here, this is your..." <- thanks for this utility. 
[15:41:51] <NeoVoid[m]> It would be cool to have it in linux without npm

[17:28:44] <iamak[m]> Even in terminal I don't need &
[18:04:34] <Hemishhehim[m]> I installed the runit version of artix, and then I had problems with booting, I fixed by fiddling with runit files, but now I can't start swaywm. It says some error: could not aquire seat, logind blah blah. I think that's something related to absence of systemd-logind in non-systemd distros, but for the replacement of logind, there is elogind (as told by artix wiki) which I have installed and is started on boot. What could be the
[18:04:35] <Hemishhehim[m]> potential problem?
[18:17:45] <Arya[m]> <Hemishhehim[m]> "I installed the runit version of..." <- do you have seatd runit service running

[18:41:06] <Hemishhehim[m]> Sway worked now: I had seatd installed, but seatd needed to be enabled and I had to install seatd-runit to have runit startup files for seatd

[19:59:47] <Arya[m]> idc about occasional spam
[20:16:25] <telegram_8037364> <Sayon[m]> "> <Sayon> where is exec ?..." <- exec is not necessary i think , it replaces sh with dwm
[20:17:38] <telegram_8037364> <iamak[m]> "> <@telegram_803736417:t2bot.io>..." <- oof, i dont know than
[20:17:53] <telegram_8037364> it might me gfx related
[20:18:01] <telegram_8037364> did you try clean dwm build
[20:18:17] <telegram_8037364> have anything in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
[20:24:12] <iamak[m]> <telegram_8037364> "did you try clean dwm build" <- Yes
[20:24:27] <iamak[m]> This issue has been there since the beginning. I was just lazy to fix it😂
[20:24:34] <iamak[m]> <telegram_8037364> "have anything in /etc/X11/xorg...." <- I'll check wait
[20:26:59] <iamak[m]> It has to do with input. I don't think that affects the loading
[20:27:08] <iamak[m]> Like I said it might be an issue with caching
[20:27:46] <iamak[m]> Since it occurs only on startup. It does not occur when I close dwm (without shutdown) and restart it
[20:54:49] <glizzster[m]1> what laptop yall use for college work?

[22:11:36] <NeoVoid[m]> <Arya[m]> "lets see if the spam situation..." <- captcha can only prevent bots not human who can read and click. technically anyone among us (linux users) can also post spam if they want to.
[22:11:36] <NeoVoid[m]> So it is practically impossible  to prevent spam. Because you can't read mind/typing buffer of the user beforr they post it.  but you can only delete it and ban the spammer. So lets not overthink it.
