[00:11:49] <hoppity> matsaman, I don't know anything about utility CSS -what is that?-. I just use TailwindCSS for the nice classes that seem to just work for me.
[00:12:13] <matsaman> "utility" is what people call all these idiot fad CSS libs like tailwin
[00:12:14] <matsaman> d
[00:12:18] <matsaman> that pretend CSS is HTML
[00:12:52] <hoppity> matsaman, what do you use for your CSS?
[00:14:43] <matsaman> CSS
[00:14:57] <hoppity> matsaman, literally hand written CSS? not even SASS?
[00:15:24] <matsaman> not even SASS
[00:15:38] <matsaman> can't imagine wasting time on something complicated enough to really benefit from such things
[00:15:51] <matsaman> if your CSS is that beastly, you're doing it wrong
[00:16:22] <doc|home> SASS is easy enough to get benefit out of. The nested CSS alone makes it worth it
[00:16:55] <hoppity> that may be true but for example, if you want to implement something like dark mode, or give the user the possibility of changing their color scheme, variables is the way to go.
[00:17:10] <hoppity> I was responding to matsaman not doc|home
[00:17:15] * doc|home nods
[00:18:09] <matsaman> dark mode, something else not worth doing

[02:55:39] <entuland> I don't follow
[02:55:47] <entuland> you have the code there, just use it
[02:59:26] <wallbroken> it doesn't work

[03:00:02] <wallbroken> https://jsfiddle.net/6b4z1w58/
[03:00:13] <wallbroken> i det two images
[03:00:21] <wallbroken> it should be 1
[03:00:41] <entuland> put placeholders there so that we can see what's happening
[03:01:36] <entuland> if you have two images where there should be just one, chances are you pasted it twice or something
[03:02:15] <wallbroken> https://jsfiddle.net/6b4z1w58/1/
[03:02:17] <wallbroken> you see?
[03:02:37] <wallbroken> this is one item with two images that are shown when you hover with a mouse
[03:02:55] <wallbroken> but when i made the soldout edit, i see the two images as two different items
[03:03:24] <UsrLocalLibera> Hello, anybody know how to add images to JSFiddle's CSS?
[03:03:43] <entuland> first, disable the hover effect, cause it's getting in the way of inspecting your page, wallbroken
[03:03:51] <entuland> UsrLocalLibera, you just put the full URL of an image there
[03:04:01] <wallbroken> i need it
[03:04:02] <entuland> if your images can't be accessed over the internet, use placeholders
[03:04:09] <wallbroken> why should i disable ?
[03:04:17] <wallbroken> entuland: i added placeholders
[03:04:23] <wallbroken> don't you see them?
[03:04:27] <UsrLocalLibera> entuland: Doesn't seem to work: https://jsfiddle.net/usrlocallibera/anwy24xk/16/
[03:04:36] <UsrLocalLibera> I tried with postimage.org
[03:04:41] <entuland> don't mix conversations up, wallbroken, that message wasn't meant for you
[03:05:10] <entuland> wallbroken, you have to disable the hover effect temporarily because it makes it more difficult to debug your page
[03:05:24] <entuland> one thing at a time, wallbroken, disable that hover effect so that we can find out why you are getting two images
[03:05:39] <entuland> UsrLocalLibera, I can see the kitten just fine in your fiddle
[03:05:48] <wallbroken> how to disable it?
[03:06:03] <UsrLocalLibera> entuland: Nope but the image in the CSS, `background-image: url("https://i.postimg.cc/NFnRzCBC/test.png");`
[03:06:07] <entuland> wallbroken, you find the CSS rule that applies the hover effect and you disable it
[03:06:34] <entuland> UsrLocalLibera, that service may not let you embed images directly
[03:06:47] <UsrLocalLibera> Maybe not, but IIRC it used to
[03:06:56] <UsrLocalLibera> Any idea which service I may use instead?
[03:07:22] <entuland> imgur seems to have the option to link images directly, but I'm not entirely sure
[03:07:46] <UsrLocalLibera> hmmm worth a shot!
[03:08:21] <wallbroken> entuland: https://jsfiddle.net/6b4z1w58/2/
[03:09:16] <entuland> okay, as you can see, there are two images in your source
[03:09:30] <wallbroken> yes, so?
[03:09:45] <entuland> you complained about having two images instead of one, remove one
[03:09:45] <wallbroken> in the original code they are overlayed with a flip effect
[03:09:51] <UsrLocalLibera> It should work either way. If I move the image from the CSS into the HTML it works just fine.
[03:09:51] <wallbroken> ...
[03:10:00] <wallbroken> entuland: are you kidding me?
[03:10:12] <wallbroken> if yes, tell me. i'll go away
[03:10:23] <entuland> wallbroken, no, I'm not kidding you, but you must understand that it's hard to help you if you don't explain your problem properly
[03:10:35] <wallbroken> do you know what the flip effect is?
[03:10:50] <wallbroken> two images overlayed that you switch between on mouse hover
[03:11:05] <wallbroken> and before applyng the "sold out" it was working flawlessly
[03:11:06] <entuland> yes, but then the problem is not that you have two images instead of one, the problem is that your flip effect got broken when you added the sold out effect
[03:11:16] <wallbroken> exactly
[03:11:25] <wallbroken> and that's why i'm assking help here
[03:12:02] <entuland> okay, first find out what is the code that is applying the flip effect, and verify what it is doing to the pair of images
[03:12:24] <entuland> chances are that that code is hiding the image and you are interfering by showing it with your soldout rules
[03:12:53] <wallbroken> https://jsfiddle.net/6b4z1w58/
[03:12:57] <wallbroken> line 326 - 335
[03:13:07] <wallbroken> this is the part which is applying the flip effect
[03:13:22] <wallbroken> but why do you want to investigate on flip effect?
[03:13:32] <wallbroken> it was working perfectly before adding sold out
[03:13:39] <entuland> because if you don't want to break it, you need to understand how it works
[03:13:43] <wallbroken> so the problem is "sold out". don't you think?
[03:13:59] <entuland> yes, the problem is the rules that you have added for the sold out effect
[03:14:16] <entuland> but in order to fix it, you need to understand _why and how_ you broken it
[03:14:20] <wallbroken> ok
[03:14:43] <entuland> so, inspect the second image in your fiddle, the one that should _not_ be shown, and see if your new rules are interfering
[03:15:17] <entuland> UsrLocalLibera, the imgur direct links to the images seem to be working, did you check that already?
[03:16:11] <wallbroken> entuland: good. i'm asking here for help and you are telling me to find out the problem by myself
[03:16:16] <wallbroken> very well
[03:16:41] <UsrLocalLibera> entuland: Yes sir
[03:16:56] <entuland> wallbroken, you should _at least_ try to find out for yourself, otherwise you're learning nothing and you're still stitching code together blindlessly
[03:17:13] <UsrLocalLibera> entuland: Postimage works too, the error must be elsewhere, I'm gonna try recreate it locally, brb
[03:17:19] <entuland> as explained multiple times, I'm not interested in doing the work for you, if you want, I can help you learn how and why those things aren't working
[03:17:20] <entuland> BUT
[03:17:26] <entuland> you need to show effort and will to learn
[03:18:05] <wallbroken> entuland: and what makes you think i did nothing to figure out the problem before coming here to ask?
[03:18:28] <entuland> show that you are trying, explain how you have inspected the image and have failed to find the conflicting rules
[03:19:52] <entuland> for one, check if the flip rules are getting applied to your sold out images at all
[03:20:09] <wallbroken> OBVIOUSLY they are not
[03:20:18] <wallbroken> becouse i get two separated images
[03:20:27] <entuland> no, that's not what I meant
[03:20:38] <entuland> they could be applied _and_ overridden by your new rules
[03:20:44] <entuland> or they could not be applied at all
[03:21:21] <entuland> considering that your working pair has the IMG tag direct children of DIV.flip, and considering that your broken pair has an additional DIV wrapper around the IMG tags, chances are those rules aren't matching anymore
[03:22:36] <entuland> this means that either you remove those wrappers and find a different way to add the sold out overlay, or you alter the flip rules so that they match with the different markup
[03:22:57] <entuland> I would make sure that the two cases (sold out and not sold out) use the same markup and only differ by class
[03:25:22] <entuland> key selector being ".flip img:nth-of-type(2)"
[03:26:48] <entuland> I could tell you half a dozen different ways to change that and make it work, but it would be useless if you don't try and understand for yourself why and how the flip effect works and why you have broken it with your additional wrappers
[03:34:47] <wallbroken> entuland: maybe i found the problem

[14:24:23] <FunkyBob> ah... img { vertical-align: top; }
[14:25:00] <FunkyBob> no... it's flagging the jigsaw URL, not yours
[14:25:34] <scara> oh
[14:25:54] <scara> Ay, that worked well
[14:28:38] <hassoon> scara: remove the gap:1px so you make all the images adjacent, i just added it to recognize each image individually { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1px;
[14:29:12] <scara> I didn't add "gap 1px;" whare are you seeing that??
[14:29:25] <scara> where*

[14:35:01] <hassoon> scara: what ??
[14:35:03] <scara> The flex solution didn't work
[14:35:41] <hassoon> why ??
[14:36:03] <scara> As I recall flex also tries to fill all of the space right? but I don't have all 262k images downloaded yet so the last few images of each line is missing, actually I don't even have all the lines lol
[14:37:24] <hassoon> scara: your images are there, i don't get it
[14:38:10] <scara> I added the display flex and flex wrap but it doesn't display them properly, try doing this on the actuall page and you will see
[14:38:24] <entuland> hassoon, did you check the horizontal scrollbar? that "page" overflows to the right by a big deal
[14:39:10] <hassoon> entuland: sure, he has hundreds of images
[14:39:23] <hassoon> entuland: how else can he put them all together ?
[14:39:49] <entuland> no idea, just pointing that out about the potentially missing images
[14:40:14] <hassoon> scara: you do have a very long horizontal scrollbar fyi
[14:40:37] <scara> no not with that flex stuff

[14:40:52] <hassoon> ??
[14:41:05] <scara> Try to load the page then add flex stuff and see it changed
[14:41:24] <scara> Ah these load slowly
[14:42:37] <scara> go to the bottom left ok? and see it doesn't say 0,0 thats how you can most easily see that flex has moved the images around
[14:42:40] *** Parts: iateadonut (~dan@121.177.17.154) ()
[14:42:54] <scara> anyway, the img vetical top thing worked too so imma use that
[14:43:12] <FunkyBob> there's a few other values that'll also work, but, yeah

[23:40:56] <scara> Isn't position: absolute; what I need to use to put a picture at some exact cordinate?
[23:43:04] <holmes> yes?
[23:43:30] <scara> I said position: absolute; left: 0; bottom: 0; so it should be at the bottom left of the screen right? but its at the bottom of the screen of the first screen, so it doesn't work when I scroll
[23:44:55] <scara> oh seems that I wanted relative not absolute
[23:46:13] <holmes> when you use position: absolute, the element is positioned absolutely in context to its closest positioned relative
[23:46:36] <holmes> so if one of that element's ancestors is position: relative or something, it'll be positioned absolutely to that element
