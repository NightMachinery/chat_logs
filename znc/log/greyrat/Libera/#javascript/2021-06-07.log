[17:52:15] <hmw[at]> entuland: console.log() only increases the count at this "n hidden" text, while console.error() is shown. I seem not to find anything that hides normal messages, so I suspect a bug
[17:52:35] <entuland> oh, I thought you referred to the coloring thing

[17:58:52] <peteyboy1> what exactly is the biggest complaint with bootstrap?

[17:59:27] *** Quits: Naan (~Naan@user/naan) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[17:59:29] <peteyboy1> i often hear "it looks bootstrappy". of course it does if you don't customize a thing. is that not right?
[17:59:54] <entuland> plenty of people that try to use it to speed up their development but then they have no idea of how to use it and end up doing lots of odd overrides fighting against the framework
[18:00:05] *** Joins: Naan (~Naan@user/naan)
[18:00:35] <peteyboy1> but it's still much easier to override, and overall not that complicated to customize, in comparison to for example material ui, no?
[18:01:13] <entuland> oh I refer to stuff like "this is not centered" or "I want these in a grid" and so forth
[18:01:16] *** Joins: DarkSeid_ (~textual@90.204.112.98)
[18:01:33] <entuland> and instead of using the facilities, they just override such layout stuff with custom CSS that messes things up here and there
[18:01:50] <peteyboy1> i haven't used in some months now so i forgot, but, i can just its buttons and inputs without messing with its layout stuff, right?
[18:02:23] <peteyboy1> why the f am i missing words on this chat lately... i haven't used it* i can just use its*
[18:02:38] <entuland> if you know the framework and use its facilities to achieve what you want, I'd say it's okay
[18:02:41] <DnzAtWrk> maybe your client has been infected by shitty js
[18:02:44] <DnzAtWrk> like most popular websites
[18:03:03] <peteyboy1> DnzAtWrk, is that for me or entuland?
[18:03:19] <hmw[at]> https://harald.ist.org/paste/images/2021-06-07_15-32-45.png -- essentially doing console.log = console.error here. Only strings get through tho
[18:03:32] <entuland> just like jQuery in the past or other libraries / frameworks, it really depends on whether you really need all the framework facilities (or a large enough chunk of it)
[18:03:44] <DnzAtWrk> I still like jquery
[18:04:05] <DnzAtWrk> I like it because it's a single self-contained file that gave you tons of additional features which were historically lacking
[18:04:13] <DnzAtWrk> standardizing a lot of missing stuff
[18:04:14] <peteyboy1> ok, so if i just want some basic quick stuff and customize it a bit - button, input, modal, i don't need css from zero or material ui, right?
[18:04:35] <entuland> it really depends on how much of its facilities you need
[18:04:46] <entuland> sometimes it's faster to go vanilla if you know enough JS and CSS
[18:04:52] <DnzAtWrk> I also like standard libraries > tons of third-party deps
[18:05:10] <DnzAtWrk> I'd much rather have a huge standard library made by a trusted group of people
[18:05:42] <peteyboy1> based on my last little project, i started using material ui because i needed an autocomplete input, but i had to use its form elements and whatnot because the inputs don't work in a normal form if i remember, which i don't think is the case in bootstrap
[18:06:31] <entuland> DnzAtWrk, you seem to have all levels shown, but you still have hidden messages, not sure why
[18:06:45] <entuland> try the old "restart" with the new settings and see if the problem persists
[18:06:57] <entuland> you should totally not get hidden messages with no chance to see them somehow

[18:07:46] <peteyboy1> that said, i ended up using MUI "only" for inputs, buttons and a dropdown menu (when clicking on the user in the header)
[18:07:52] <hmw[at]> entuland: hence my assumption of a bug somewhere
[18:07:52] <DnzAtWrk> I wonder if you can insert a canvas in console.x
[18:08:06] <peteyboy1> are some styling/UI frameworks much more valued than others in the industry?
[18:08:11] <DnzAtWrk> well, if you can't, you could probably insert a base64 encoded image
[18:08:21] <hmw[at]> DnzAtWrk: you can dump the canvas object, but I don't think you can dump actual images
[18:08:23] <entuland> can't be grouping cause that's the round red circles with the numbers inside
[18:09:01] <hmw[at]> entuland: That was my fallback by using console.error - at least those messages show up and I have a *chance* to debug my stuff :)
[18:10:09] <entuland> what happens if you click on the cog wheel on the right?
[18:10:19] <hmw[at]> Perhaps that proxy doesn't support transferring objects, with all the "fancy" live updating of objects (which I never want. Why would I like to inspect an object 10 hours after it was logged)
[18:10:21] <entuland> there are things you can toggle there
[18:10:45] <entuland> no, if you get the number there about the hidden messages, your dev tools _are_ receving them and you ought to be able to see them
[18:11:15] <hmw[at]> depends on what arrives.
[18:11:55] <entuland> if it doesn't arrive at all wouldn't show as hidden either, that would be completely screwed otherwise
[18:12:05] <entuland> what are your toggles in the cog wheel configuration?

[18:12:51] <entuland> these toggles: https://i.imgur.com/5uhMNJt.png
[18:13:02] <hmw[at]> I imagine that there would be a need for a "live" connection between dumped objects and the memory of the browser, so they can be retroactively analysed and displayed, once the dev uncollapses them. I can see how an open source proxy isn't capable of doing that. Pure conjecture tho.

[18:39:35] <hmw[at]> DnzAtWrk: 1) Don't log in a loop 2) Put your stuff inside console.group()  3) close the console after starting  4) use a kill script that stops your browser before it rips down your OS through excessive RAM usage
[18:39:46] <DnzAtWrk> I log in requestAnimationFrame

[18:42:20] <DnzAtWrk> I don't know why canvas is so fast in chrome compared to firefox
[18:42:24] <hmw[at]> DnzAtWrk: You can't really log in animation frame programs (simply too much) - wich such programs, I use a special log facility that renders certain things on screen instead. Another possibility is let first_frame = true; -- log only the first frame and set first_frame = false; when you have logged the first frame (or a few frames)

[18:42:56] <hmw[at]> ok
[18:42:59] <hmw[at]> lol nice idea
[18:43:12] <hmw[at]> I'd rather % the time or frame number tho
[18:43:19] <hmw[at]> (modulo=
[18:43:20] <DnzAtWrk> if you keep track of it
[18:43:48] <hmw[at]> you can   next_log_time = Date.now() + interval;

[18:45:16] <DnzAtWrk> just throws an error after logging
[18:45:49] <hmw[at]> I don't see where to use that, can you elaborate a bit?
[18:45:57] <hmw[at]> what is the effect
[18:46:23] <hmw[at]> pause execution?
[18:46:30] <DnzAtWrk> if I use console.log in rAF, it would just continuou spamming it forever so I can't read anything
[18:46:35] <DnzAtWrk> so I just crash the program after logging
[18:46:47] <hmw[at]> Perhaps try  debugger;  instead
[18:46:59] <DnzAtWrk> meh, the debugger is a chore to use
[18:47:09] <hmw[at]> it halts the program without error tho
[18:47:16] <DnzAtWrk> yeah but it hardly matters

[20:21:16] <ljharb> why would you need a sourcemap of react itself??

[20:21:23] <wroathe> That issue is two years old, and they've still got building with sourcemaps disabled in their build scripts. I almost wonder if the Facebook devs themselves use alternate build tooling internally, and maintain these limited rollup scripts for the public separately
[20:21:30] <ljharb> you shouldn't be debugging react itself, only your own app code
[20:21:58] <jaawerth> ljharb: if you are developing on react or trying to figure out an internal react error thrown?
[20:22:02] <ljharb> you shouldn
[20:22:03] <ljharb> 't be
[20:22:08] <ljharb> file an issue and let the react team do it
[20:22:14] <ljharb> anyways the react team is obsessed with size; they wouldn't ship sourcemaps anyways because the in-file comment adds bytes
[20:22:30] <jaawerth> so nobody but the react team should contribute to react?
[20:22:34] <ljharb> jaawerth: i suppose the "developing on react" part is fair
[20:23:09] <ljharb> but yeah i do think that's kind of what the react team wants
[20:23:25] <ljharb> (primarily only the core team contributing to react, i mean)
[20:23:25] <jaawerth> yeah I mean, either if I wanted to contribute or - WAY more likely - if you hit a bug, and don't want to/can't wait on the devs getting back to you, being able to clone it and build a dev copy with sourcemaps would still be useful
[20:23:43] <ljharb> i'm sure you could send a PR that tweaks their rollup config to do that
[20:23:53] <jaawerth> right, it's weird that they're being obtuse about it though is my point
[20:23:57] <ljharb> not sure how valuable it is tho, they don't do much transpiling
[20:24:13] *** Joins: heatwave (~heatwave@23.81.176.160)
[20:24:45] <jaawerth> true, and if there's little transpiling then at least you can use an unminified build. It's still a pain to manually figure out where in the giant bundle to look in the src though
[20:24:52] <jaawerth> that is, to manually map the source\
[20:25:07] <jaawerth> like even for the react team itself it would be useful for them to have it
[20:25:38] <ljharb> you can, for dev
[20:25:43] <ljharb> unminified builds are all over the place
[20:25:55] <jaawerth> lol no
[20:25:58] <ljharb> jaawerth: https://unpkg.com/browse/react@17.0.2/umd/react.development.js
[20:26:04] <jaawerth> I mean even with unminified sourcemaps would still be useful

[20:26:28] <jaawerth> because with one big bundle it's not always trivial to know where line N is in the src
[20:26:48] <jaawerth> you generally gottaj ump around or hope there's a unique function name nearby
[20:27:13] <jaawerth> if I were on the react dev team that would annoy me pretty quick lol
[20:27:41] <jaawerth> granted the user who submitted this issue just sounds like they wanted to poke around so I get the "why is this important to you" questions, but I also think the OP is right that it's weird not to have it
[20:27:56] <ljharb> i see what you mean
[20:28:02] <ljharb> but i haven't found it a huge impediment

[20:29:11] <onosendi> jaawerth: you were talking about keyboard accessibility with me last night regarding that menu... last component at the bottom: https://invoice.dlindegren.com/ - I just listen for up/down/enter keys when the menu is open. Does this seem fine?
[20:29:44] <hmw[at]> Btw, installing Chrome on an iPhone doesn't really get me a new browser, right? It looks like all alternative browsers just wrap Safari somehow
[20:29:50] <onosendi> Is this*
[20:30:11] <jaawerth> sorry I don't really have time to review anything today. I was just mentioning that when possible it's best to let the brower do its thing via markup via tabindex and such, to maximize a11y and whatnot (plus hijacking the keyboard from js in and of itself is best avoided whenever possible)
[20:30:35] <onosendi> jaawerth: np

[20:34:54] <jaawerth> ljharb: this is something we run into sometimes with fennel - there's an internal sourcemap implementation so that when you run the compiler live you get back the original foo.fnl locations (and a function for turning lua stacktraces into fennel ones), but the sourcemaps aren't exportable yet so if you compile + bundle (thanks to macros the compiler is also a basic module bundler by turning
[20:34:56] <jaawerth> `require` into `include`!), following stacktraces in AOT-compiled code is annoying

[20:40:08] <ljharb> jaawerth: right, i think there's a pretty big difference tho between "basically normal JS, smooshed together in a bundle" and "converted to JS from not-JS", absent sourcemaps
[20:40:20] <ljharb> jaawerth: but yeah not a strong argument for avoiding them at least in the dev build
[20:40:52] <jaawerth> yeah. if they did more transpilation I would say it's nuts that they don't have them, but with just bundling it would simply be annoying
[20:41:56] <jaawerth> in the case of fennel it can be one or both of bundling/compilling, but fortunately the lua output is super readable anyway so it's not hard to figure out. also there's a reverse compiler called anti-fennel that isn't perfectly symmetrical but closer than I thought it would be lol

[22:45:07] <wroathe> Also, consultations with lawyers are usually free. If someone is trying to bully you legally it's worth reaching out to a lawyer to see if what they're saying holds any water
[22:47:15] <jaawerth> in cases like this (particularly since they used to be an intern and a lot of companies have a "we own stuff you make if you came up with the idea here" contract that is, strictly speaking, not super enforceable, but in practice these situations are almost always won by the side who can throw the most lawyers at the situation

[22:50:13] <jaawerth> hard to say. some companies just send the threat figuring people won't want to go through the trouble of fighting it, but the company doesn't *actually* want to bother with it either. sometimes they're worried they could lose a patent if they don't defend every possible infringement

[22:56:16] <wroathe> jaawerth: Regardless, it's still worth reaching out. The lawyer can then advise you what the path to go down is. If there is no such clause and they have no legal leg to stand on, I'm guessing most lawyers will be happy to send the employer a legal "fuck off" notice.
[22:57:33] <onosendi> wroathe: agreed, definitely wouldn't have hurt.
[22:57:40] <jaawerth> true. plus, not allowing companies/other large entities to get away with throwing stuff like that around with the assumption that it will just cow people is never a bad thing - even if they DO move forward and you have to cave, at least you made them work for it lol
[22:58:25] <jaawerth> it reminds me of how landlords do lots of illegal things in terms of security deposit and such figuring the tenants won't have the resources/time/knwoledge to fight them on it
