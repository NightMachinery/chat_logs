[00:32:04] <manicennui> Two-thirds of the marriage applications in Buncombe County last year that involved at least one person under 18 originated from people who lived outside of North Carolina, Reisinger said, noting that a 49-year-old man and 17-year-old girl recently came from Kentucky seeking a license.
[00:32:43] <manicennui> "The state is currently one of 13 that allow children under 16 to wed"
[00:32:48] <manicennui> WTF
[00:33:31] <manicennui> "The proposed legislation would raise the minimum marriage age from 14 to 16 and limit the age difference between a 16-year-old and their spouse to four years."
[00:33:32] <manicennui> ...
[00:34:09] <manicennui> Why does anyone under 18 need to get married?
[00:34:15] <manicennui> Even 18 is pretty insane.
[00:39:37] <bkero> Why would we need to know the reasons why?
[00:40:01] <bkero> Why is anybody allowed to put pineapple on a pizza?
[00:40:28] <bkero> Both have the potential for child abuse.

[02:29:14] <gwozniak> Yeah, the video on that PineNote announcement is mostly a bunch of stuff I don't care about
[02:29:37] <gwozniak> I hope the device is good. I'm not going to get one, but I wish it well
[02:31:18] <cb> pine stuff tends to be a bunch of tinker toys for nerds, not a readymade product. to be fair, that's what they expicitly say and aim for, no false pretense
[02:38:07] <gwozniak> I don't like note-taking devices in general, aside from pen and paper, so I doubt I'd ever get one.
[02:39:38] <gwozniak> I have enough device junk anyway, so I'm not going to go out and buy more of it
[02:48:46] <cb> i have no need for a modern device i wont use. vintage stuff, absolutely though

[12:41:33] <buttsbot> Did America just lose Afghanistan because of WhatsApp? – Preston Byrne
[12:59:39] <riv> people are trying to pin things on biden but i feel like he's just some dude that has nothing to do with any of this?
[13:00:10] <riv> the clip is pretty embarassing but like, he's obviously just repeating a line he's been told to say - politicans do this
[13:01:00] <riv> "Conventionally, the United States did everything right" I think that's debatable
[13:08:33] <Brekkjern> No, I do believe they did everything right "conventionally"
[13:08:52] <Brekkjern> But they weren't fighting a conventional war and refused to acknowledge that
[13:09:53] <Brekkjern> I bet the Polish cavalry did everything correctly from a conventional viewpoint as the German tanks blitzkrieged across their borders. They still lost.
[13:09:56] <quanticle> gerikson: The hncels are really on one
[13:11:13] <Brekkjern> To me it sounds like the US overestimated the value of intelligence gained from monitoring WhatsApp and similar communications compared to the the value Taliban gained from using them
[13:12:25] <quanticle> gerikson: So I actually read the piece, and it's really as dumb as it sounds.
[13:12:32] <quanticle> The Taliban didn't win because of Whatsapp
[13:13:00] <Brekkjern> I think them winning because of WhatsApp is a rather reductive take, yeah
[13:13:13] <quanticle> They won because they did exactly what all successful conquerors of Afghanistan have done since Alexander The Great: convince local forces to switch sides: https://scholars-stage.org/fighting-like-taliban/
[13:13:14] <buttsbot> Fighting Like Taliban – The Scholar's Stage
[13:13:37] <quanticle> Now, they may have sent messages using Whatsapp, instead of text messages, or human messengers
[13:13:50] <quanticle> But that doesn't mean that Whatsapp was somehow "key" to their victory
[13:14:00] <quanticle> Or that their victory would have been apprciably slower without it
[13:14:33] <Brekkjern> Agreed, but they would have had a much more difficult time to do anything productive if WhatsApp, Twitter, Signal, etc was disabled in the country.
[13:15:09] <quanticle> Well, they managed to almost conquer Afghanistan in 2001, before Whatsapp, Signal, Twitter or even smartphones were invented
[13:15:16] <quanticle> So... I'm not sure, actually
[13:15:20] <Brekkjern> Absolutely
[13:15:29] <Brekkjern> But they set up a government practically overnight
[13:15:33] <quanticle> No
[13:15:42] <quanticle> They spent twenty years setting up a government
[13:16:00] <quanticle> 50 years if you count their experience in the Afghan Civil War and their experience fighting the Soviets
[13:16:50] <Brekkjern> I'd bet that if they didn't have access to any of those comms services, they would not be able to present such a united front  across the entire country
[13:16:53] <quanticle> Like, this is what insurgency and counterinsurgency is: it's not about winning and then setting up a government. You set up the government, and you convince people that your government *works*
[13:17:14] <Brekkjern> I get that
[13:17:24] <Brekkjern> I'm saying the strategic values are disproportionate here
[13:17:42] <Brekkjern> The US valued the intel greater than the benefit to the Taliban. I'm not sure that was the correct call.
[13:18:22] <quanticle> That's exactly what I'm disputing. The strategic values aren't disproportionate. All conflicts have tipping points like these, where the fact that Taliban are winning goes from individual knowledge to common knowledge.
[13:18:44] <quanticle> And you don't need Whatsapp to engineer such a tipping point.
[13:18:54] <Brekkjern> That is not what I'm saying
[13:19:32] <quanticle> You're suggesting that the Taliban's victory would have taken place more slowly if the US had cut Afghanistan off from 21st century social media and communication technologies, yes?
[13:20:00] <Brekkjern> They have been using these communications platforms for quite some time to coordinate across the country. Disrupting that coordination would presumably give the US a greater chance of creating a stable Afghan government that the locals could see as the strong party.
[13:20:47] <quanticle> Yeah, no. I don't think the Taliban were using these communication platforms in a meaningful sense until very recently. They know full well that using cell phones invites US drone strikes.
[13:20:48] <Brekkjern> If any coordination between cells would require sneakernet, they would end up sluggish and would rarely be able to engage with numbers greater than the local cells
[13:20:55] <quanticle> They've had that lesson beaten into them.
[13:21:45] <Brekkjern> I'm not talking about tactical communication here. I'm talking about strategic.
[13:21:47] <quanticle> Nope, that's incorrect, because during the Soviet invasion, that's exactly what they had to use. Sneakernet. They knew that any sort of radio communication would be intercepted by the Soviets. And yet, they were able to muster and coordinate far greater numbers of troops than they do even today.
[13:22:25] <quanticle> They were able to coordinate an insurgency against an enemy far more willing to invest blood and treasure to keep them out. And they did it with '70s tech.
[13:22:40] <Brekkjern> True, but the Soviets did not have the intel and force projection capabilities that the US has
[13:23:09] <quanticle> No, their intel and force projection capabilities were *far greater*. Remember, to the Soviet Union, Afghanistan is *literally* next door.
[13:23:29] <quanticle> Remember, back then, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, etc, were all Soviet Republics
[13:23:44] <quanticle> Afghanistan occupied the same position for the Soviets that Mexico does for the United States
[13:24:54] <Brekkjern> Proximity does not necessarily have an impact on either force projection or intel. Not when you have multiple large bases in the country and neighbouring countries
[13:25:19] <quanticle> It's not like they had to build this precarious supply line across thousands of miles of ocean, and cross a semi-hostile country (Pakistan) just to get supplies to their troops.
[13:26:01] <Brekkjern> No, they usually got resupplied through Rammstein Airforce Base in Germany
[13:26:15] <quanticle> And you think the Soviets didn't have large bases in Afghanistan? Who do you think we inherited Bagram from?
[13:26:27] <Brekkjern> I absolutely do think they had bases there
[13:26:45] <Brekkjern> I'm saying the force projection from those bases was lacking
[13:27:12] <quanticle> That's totally false, btw. We sent *troops* through Bagram. But their supplies? Those were trucked up through Pakistan. You can't send meaningful amounts of heavy equipment, such as Humvees, by air.
[13:27:42] <quanticle> The vast vast majority of our stuff in Afghanistan went in through Pakistan, and when we left, it went out through Pakistan
[13:30:55] <quanticle> Yeah, I'm saying you're uninformed about the facts of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which is understandable given that the US media (both at the time and continuing up even through the present day) presents a very simplified narrative that paints the Soviets as these blundering buffoons who were kicked out by insurgents (and whose defeat precipitated the fall of the Soviet Union
[13:30:58] <quanticle> itself). But that's wrong. The Soviets fought hard in Afghanistan, and they fought better than the US did in Vietnam. They managed to set up a government that was, if not self-sustaining, at least stable enough to survive as long as Soviet arms and weapons kept flowing.
[13:31:32] <quanticle> The Communist regime in Afghanistan only collapsed when the Soviets stopped being able to reinforce with cash and guns.
[13:31:46] <quanticle> But the US regime in Afghanistan? All the cash and guns in the world couldn't have saved it.
[13:32:04] <Brekkjern> I think you are misunderstanding what I am trying to say...
[13:32:45] <quanticle> You're suggesting that I give this article about WhatsApp playing a role in the collapse of the US regime in Afghanistan more than zero credence.
[13:33:01] <Brekkjern> No
[13:33:05] <Brekkjern> That article is shit
[13:33:11] <quanticle> Then we're agreed
[13:33:17] <quanticle> What were we arguing for?
[13:35:04] <Brekkjern> But Taliban has had free reign across every SoMe platform for the last 10+ years to use for coordination and creating a viable alternative government. The US has allowed them this access "Because intell!" which I believe they have overvalued greatly over the benefit it has had for Taliban.
[13:35:26] <Brekkjern> Sure, they fought the Soviets without it, but during that time they were not a viable alternative for the local population
[13:35:28] <Brekkjern> Now they are
[13:35:35] <Brekkjern> But I gotta run. Lunch.
[13:35:53] <quanticle> Okay, but the fact that the Taliban conquered 90% of Afghanistan *without* social media means that, no, they didn't actually need it to win.
[13:37:16] <quanticle> Like, in 2001, the Taliban had *just* assassinated the leader of the opposition movement, the Northern Alliance, and were making their final offensive to retake the last stronholds that had held out against their rule. They were *this* close to conquering all of Afghanistan before the came in, like Gandalf with the Rohirrim.
[13:38:13] <quanticle> Yeah, anyway, I could go on about this for hours, but I have a laptop to install Linux on.

[20:34:23] <indigo> We still have a space force guys
[20:35:56] <gwozniak> hahaha
[20:36:47] <gwozniak> You just know that Musk and Bezos think that the Space Force is the coolest thing ever
[20:42:35] <companion_cube> 5$ say that Musk thinks of himself as space batman
[20:45:46] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I don't know why Biden felt the need to say that, and things like that tend to become the focus instead of anything worthwhile.
[20:46:05] <Brekkjern> I didn't know he said it before I saw that picture
[20:47:07] <manicennui> /r/conservative is of course full of posts about how Biden screwed up Afghanistan.
[20:47:12] <gwozniak> I don't entirely trust the quote (could very well be true), but I do appreciate the Space Force flag
[20:47:17] <manicennui> Didn't the withdrawal start under Trump?
[20:47:36] <gwozniak> As I understand, it's been in the works for a while
[20:47:41] <Brekkjern> Ahem... "Mission Accomplished"
[20:48:00] <gwozniak> Time for a banner
[20:48:03] <manicennui> 8th submission is basically that image.
[20:49:39] <indigo> I mean, would /r/conservative have rather stayed in Afghanistan indefinitely?
[20:49:52] <manicennui> They would also be mad if we did that.
[20:49:55] <manicennui> And blame Biden.
[20:50:19] <manicennui> But this is the perfect thing to latch on to, because everyone agrees that it's a shitty situation.
[20:50:32] <indigo> So basically it doesn't matter what happens, just what administration it happens under
[20:50:51] <indigo> If it was a Republican president maybe they'll be saying "oh well, you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs"
[20:50:56] <manicennui> That doesn't even matter because they are experts at blaming things that happen under Republicans on previous Democrats.
[20:51:09] <ngoldbaum> everything is partisan and the rules don’t matter
[20:51:42] <manicennui> Democrats definitely tend to blame Republicans for the economies they inherit, but there is pretty definitive evidence that the economy sucked when they entered office.
[20:52:03] <manicennui> I don't think anyone will dispute that the economy sucked when both Obama and Biden were inaugurated.
[20:52:33] <indigo> Yeah but the stock market did so well under Trump!
[20:52:43] <manicennui> At best you could blame the pandemic in this case.
[20:54:32] <manicennui> It did well under Obama too.

[21:22:56] <bkero> Error budgets, deployments, risk, holidays
[21:24:59] <mgdm> Error budgets are basically a number for how on fire do you want to be /s
[21:26:04] <bkero> How on fire can you *afford to be*
[21:26:08] <dcz> medium rare plz
[21:27:20] <gwozniak> Nice and rare here
[21:28:14] <dcz> tbh it's useful to have a way to compare the importance of different values: reaching new customers and staying reliable
[21:37:26] <indigo> bkero: There could be a ton of things on fire that aren't user-facing
[21:37:38] <indigo> Eg. pages that aren't actionable, pipelines that are flaky, etc
[21:37:47] <indigo> Those usually don't go into an error budget
[21:38:13] <bkero> It sounds like you need a better-defined error budget domain then
[21:38:41] <Brekkjern> There can also be a ton of shit that's broken and user facing, but the users don't have any options for the service, so they are SOL
[21:40:05] <Xe> is it overengineering to break out sqlite to do a spreadsheet thing?
[21:40:23] <indigo> I think I just need a holiday
[21:40:34] <Brekkjern> Xe: Is a CSV not doing it for you?
[21:40:59] <indigo> What spreadsheet thing are you trying to do?
[21:41:21] <Xe> Brekkjern: i have some gnarly queries like `INSERT INTO costs SELECT printf('%s set (1hr) Discord: %s', name, discord) AS name, rate AS cost, FALSE AS hst_exempt FROM djs WHERE rate IS NOT NULL;`

[23:46:58] <manicennui> People seem to be mostly giving up on wearing masks here.
[23:47:06] <manicennui> Even on the CTA, where they are still required.
[23:50:55] <ben> ya i haven't seen many here lately either
[23:52:31] <mouseghost> same here
[23:53:45] <ben> feeling somewhat cautious about delta variant but the number of breakthrough cases is still crazy low

[23:57:17] <indigo> My main worry are the unvaccinated taking up ICU beds
[23:59:02] <ben> ya
[23:59:46] <Brekkjern> At some point they are going to be triaging based on who is more likely to survive with the help from the ICU
[23:59:56] <Brekkjern> Unvaccinated are unlikely to be prioritized there
