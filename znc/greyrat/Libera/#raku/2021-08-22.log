[00:14:30] <moon-child> casaca: use of ternary in OTP.rakumod seems weird.  I definitely would either turn that into a straight if/else or factor out the 'current-time ='.  But you can also do $current-time = $!posix-time || now.to-posix.head.Int - T0
[00:16:17] <moon-child> casaca: Generate.rakumod: '$secret = $secret.encode('ascii')' can be '$secret .= encode('ascii')'

[05:38:53] <casaca> moon-child: thank you for the notes. 
[05:40:07] <moon-child> actually, on further consideration, 0 seems like it should be a valid value for posix-time.  So maybe use // instead of ||, and don't have a default of 0

[13:55:35] <nine> I couldn't even connect via ssh
[13:56:15] <rba> nine: I guess resource issues from a trial to login with different users.
