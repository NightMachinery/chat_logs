[00:02:50] <pyzozord> so that vim can act as vi/ed fulfilment on systems that want to be posix but don't want real ed/vi
[00:03:20] <jinsun> Manjaro is Arch for noobs, so it doesn't include the difficult stuff, it replaces ed and vi with nano, which most people were going to do anyway
[00:03:57] <seraphim_> nano looks good enough but they shouldn't remove support for vim.

[00:41:17] <seraphim_> pyzozord: autocomplete and vertical blocks are two completely different and unrelated things. one works semantic level, other works on string manipulation of the actual code. they are not even comparable. that being said, autocomplete is also one of the frills like highlighting in my books.
[00:41:25] <seraphim_> pyzozord: there you go.
[00:41:51] <pyzozord> you'd usually write :.,+10s/^/\/\// but that's more confusing with the slashes, so alternative s:pattern:replace: form is useful

[03:55:52] <joebrandin> well if you dont know use google lol
[03:55:55] <[itchyjunk]> so i guess i need a starting point. beaky what class do i start with to learn gui crap in java?
[03:55:57] <joebrandin> oop is piece of cake
[03:56:13] <[itchyjunk]> maybe it gets easy after using it for a long time
[03:56:23] <beaky> in java swing is the standard gui gramework swing is the one to search for
[03:56:31] <rty> in java especially it can be highly educative to write e.g. sort filters, where the user can choose how the list is displayed based on parameters specified

[04:00:42] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[04:00:48] <joebrandin> better do all in one

[04:02:24] <pulse> you always need an interface, you can start out with a terminal interface though
[04:02:27] <pulse> a lot of programs actually start out that way
[04:02:36] <pulse> as terminal utils that later on get some kind of UI
[04:02:37] <rty> yes. ideally your program should be enough encapsulated and modularized so that adding gui is an iterative improvement, and not something that you have to put instead of something else
[04:02:52] <pulse> but without the interface you don't have any way to interact with your program
[04:03:04] <pulse> i would disagree this is a good approach though - you probably want to decide if it's a GUI application before you even start
[04:03:06] <joebrandin> bingo
[04:03:14] <joebrandin> i say develop all at once :)
[04:03:41] <pulse> or write your core functionality as a library
[04:03:48] <pulse> and then you can have both terminal and GUI version of the frontend
[04:03:50] <rty> having a cli-only interface at first will also help with automating your program and testing it
[04:03:53] <pulse> or even web, or what have you

[10:59:32] <lockywolf> having a dedicated disown would have been better
[10:59:34] <novns> lockywolf, because nobody knew about these problems when things were invented, and fork became the standard

[11:01:22] <novns> lockywolf, disown is about job table and HUP signals
[11:01:33] <novns> it's not about child processes

[13:55:41] <GeDaMo> Hi alycidyne :)
[13:56:31] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: I just found the first useful introduction to ld's scripting language - in, like, several years ^^   https://wiki.osdev.org/Linker_Scripts
[13:56:32] <bayaz> Title: Linker Scripts - OSDev Wiki 
[13:57:18] <GeDaMo> I've never used linker scripts
[13:58:18] <alycidyne> I know, but for me it was a big mystery
[13:58:47] <pyzozord> I hear about them first time. I assume that might be the interface gcc uses to communicate with ld
[14:00:02] <GeDaMo> It's more about how the linker lays out the executable
[14:00:48] <GeDaMo> So when it's loaded, the different sections can get put at particular locations in memory
[14:02:51] <pyzozord> That's cool. I guess that's the best way to produce standalone executables but still have images and other resources available in your program
[14:03:37] <alycidyne> Now, this is also very important because, in a system with single-level store, all administration boils down to administration of the system's memory layout. So the linker is the most important application in such a system
[14:03:45] <GeDaMo> Also, some systems e.g. Harvard architectures have specific requirements

[14:04:57] <alycidyne> So, if this linker scripting language could be made easier to use interactively, it could become a shell - potentially making sh and most of its concepts redundant
[14:05:02] <smallville7123> so far none of the cross platform GUI toolkits i have looked at both look nice/modern, and support BOTH android and ios, in addition to windows, macos, linux

[14:10:15] <Akronymus> Wait, I think I may have misunderstood it.
[14:10:44] <Akronymus> So, it is (x,y,width,height) rather than (x1,y1,x2,y2)?
[14:11:07] <smallville7123> eg parent x 10, child x 10, child width 10,   child absolute width = parent x + child x + child width

[14:14:08] <smallville7123> tho it should be renamed

[14:14:36] <smallville7123> yea
[14:14:38] <Akronymus> Rather than top left corner + size
[14:15:11] <smallville7123> tho i dont want to duplicate my position call just to rename its x, y, width, height variables

[16:49:52] <Rashad> My problem is: I want to find non-active companies at a certain date. if I do `select cmp where valid_to < SYSDATE`, and if the company has a record with a `valid_to` that is `NULL`, then the company will still be active today just that it was suspended sometime in the past.
[16:50:04] <smallville7123> that is what i currently do
[16:50:06] <networker> do you guys usually include standard headers in your self-made headers too ? like when i create a new.h and is included by my main.h when compiling and functions inside new.h does require some functions from <stdio.h> which was already included in the main one, so do you guys still include it in new.h or just let it be ?
[16:50:23] <akronymus> But you said you are doing point + size
[16:50:42] <Rashad> so somehow I need to check that all the records for such a company have a valid_to that is not NULL and < SYSDATE
[16:50:49] <smallville7123> except for my Position class its variables are named differently
[16:50:53] <Rashad> how do I do that?
[16:50:59] <smallville7123> but it still contains 4 variables
[16:51:27] <pyzozord> Rashad: "is not null" doesn't work?
[16:52:14] <smallville7123> networker: it is good practice to include required headers in all self-made headers
[16:52:15] <pyzozord> Rashad: have you googled for it yet? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/138493/how-to-do-a-sql-not-null-with-a-datetime
[16:52:15] <bayaz> Title: How to do a SQL NOT NULL with a DateTime? 
[16:52:59] <networker> smallville7123: does doing that increase any memory or it will stay the same ?
[16:53:24] <akronymus> `Select unique * from table where company not in (select company from table where valid_from < SOMEDATE and (valid_to is null or valid_to > SOMEDATE))`

[16:53:34] <smallville7123> networker: headers should be if-guarded or `#pragma once`
[16:53:35] <Rashad> pyzozord I think I need a group by statement: SELECT MAX(VALID_TO) FROM COMPANIES GROUP BY COMPANY_CODE
[16:53:54] <smallville7123> networker: it only affects the compiler's compilation speed
[16:53:54] <Rashad> but I need to see how MAX handles null
[16:54:18] <akronymus> But you only want those that are not valid at a certain date.
[16:54:22] <smallville7123> eg it needs to parse more headers but can skip headers that have already been processed if they contain an ifdef guard
[16:54:27] <networker> smallville7123: huh so i guess it wont' eat up more memory then
[16:54:28] <akronymus> which should work with the query I wrote
[16:54:29] <smallville7123> or a #pragma once
[16:54:38] <smallville7123> networker: in your program, NEVER
[16:54:52] <smallville7123> except if the headers allocate global/static storage
[16:55:04] <Rashad> akronymus: looking into it
[16:55:04] <smallville7123> eg if a header contains int mem[5000]
[16:55:05] <pyzozord> Rashad: I'm not sure that you do. select * from companies where valid_to is not null and valid_to < [now] seems to be reasonable
[16:55:16] <akronymus> smallville7123 redundant data is a HUGE cause of problems.
[16:55:28] <smallville7123> yea
[16:55:37] <akronymus> So, I'd say only use one representation for location and size
[16:55:40] <smallville7123> since it often leads to duplicate definitions and such
[16:56:04] <akronymus> And have a extra function to convert to a different representation but that isn't part of the object itself
[16:56:37] <networker> smallville7123: probably gonna include #ifndef if that is what you meant
[16:56:42] <networker> if it is already included then do nothing
[16:56:46] <Rashad> pyzozord that doesn't work because the same company might be active now (valid_to is null) and also was suspended before (valid_to < now)
[16:56:49] <smallville7123> networker: no
[16:56:55] <smallville7123> networker: for example
[16:57:08] <smallville7123> #ifndef MY_HEADER_H
[16:57:10] <Rashad> pyzozord remember that the records repeat even for the same company
[16:57:14] <smallville7123> #define MY_HEADER_H
[16:57:17] <akronymus> `from2pointstopointandsize(twopoints) { return {x1,y1,x2-x1,y2-y1}}`
[16:57:18] <smallville7123> / my header
[16:57:20] <smallville7123> #endif
[16:57:31] <Rashad> pyzozord the records are not the current status of the company, but records of periods of activations 
[16:57:38] <smallville7123> that is an #ifdef heard
[16:57:48] <smallville7123> that is an #ifdef guard      *
[16:57:48] <Rashad> I should have called the table "activations" rather than "companies" earlier 
[16:57:59] <smallville7123> or rather #ifndef guard
[16:58:07] <akronymus> And `frompointandsizetotwopoints(pointandsize) {return {x,y,x+widht,y+height}}`
[16:58:20] <akronymus> Those two should work, with somet adjustements for oyu smallville7123
[16:58:35] <akronymus> Didn't make it correct code but it should convey the idea
[16:58:52] <smallville7123> akronymus: yea
[16:58:56] <akronymus> Basically: Internally use only one representation.
[16:59:08] <networker> smallville7123: oh, so that #define is gonna include my header in ?

[21:13:02] <droid3> I am wondering is there any difference between n = a/b and math.floor( n )
[21:13:20] <Izem> yes
[21:13:28] <droid3> interms of computers do integer division if both things are integers 
[21:13:33] <Izem> a/b is truncate(a)
[21:13:59] <Izem> hmm, I guess it is the same?
[21:14:12] <deniska> truncate is different from floor for negative numbers

[21:14:19] <Izem> right
[21:14:31] <droid3> 10/3 = 3 and  floor( 10/3) = 3
[21:15:11] <droid3> = floor( (double)10/(double)3 )

[21:17:29] <pyzozord> I just realized I don't know how to print last ten lines using sed.

[21:18:53] *** nekodesu_ is now known as nekobit
[21:18:57] <Lope> Because they said in MongoDB, every key in every document, consumes RAM/storage
[21:18:58] <droid3> it seems by default integer division is giving us the floor function. So why would be need such floor functions in math libraries

[21:20:44] <droid3> I mean even if you had two double numbers it would give you back a double result that all you have to do is cast to an int to get the floor
[21:21:23] <Izem> pyzozord sort | seq 10q is the easy way :P
[21:21:25] <pyzozord> Izem: not sure good question. I think it's possible with gnu version, but maybe the in posix version it's not possible
[21:21:34] <Izem> sort -r or something
[21:21:34] <Stefan26> 'cast to int' is truncate? so -0.8 becomes 0?
[21:21:35] <droid3> if you had two integer to divide then its even easier you just do the division and get the integer division result 
[21:21:48] <Izem> Stefan26 yeah I think so
[21:21:56] <droid3> because all it is ...is truncating off the decimal part how is this different then floor???
[21:22:10] <Stefan26> floor(-0.8)=-1

[21:23:47] <droid3> ya Stefan good point but if your restrict your floor(x)  where x always >= 0 then it should be fine. It only is different / doesnt work in the negative number realm
[21:24:09] <droid3> correct me if  i am wrong
[21:25:52] <droid3> I was working with only x>=0 numbers anyway that why i was thinking do i even need floor functions in those case rather then just using casting or truncating with integer division instead.

[23:00:56] <DarkCthulhu> That's a fair analogy pyzozord.

[23:03:53] <[itchyjunk]> Given a task and 2 possible algos, if you don't really deal with algos you will just ask someone which one you should use
[23:04:08] <[itchyjunk]> and they will tell you a) or b) if you are resource constrained or somesuch
[23:04:28] <[itchyjunk]> but for your customized task, it might be better to tweak either one even at the cost of memory

[23:05:36] <DarkCthulhu> pyzozord, by never up leveling the abstractions we think in, I think there's more to lose though. Also I would think that the shift towards higher levels of abstraction has been occurring for a long time now.

[23:34:29] <DarkCthulhu> ...which makes sense 
[23:35:23] <[itchyjunk]> they purchased that AI startup
[23:35:28] <[itchyjunk]> and completly fucked them over

[23:35:41] <[itchyjunk]> and their investment in "blockchains" fucked up
[23:36:04] <[itchyjunk]> they tried foundry and that fucked up too, right?
[23:36:09] <[itchyjunk]> i think they sold it to Intel?
[23:36:13] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm i can't remember :(
[23:36:34] <DarkCthulhu> I think when it comes to integrating a startup into the company, I like Apple's track record. Very specific acquisitions that seem to work well at least from what I hear. 
[23:36:54] <Izem> brilliant I just got an idea
[23:37:16] <Izem> I market plan9 as blockchain and we get os research going again :P
