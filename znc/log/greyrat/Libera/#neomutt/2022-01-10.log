[00:24:05] <ciphrCat> the copy-message command copies all headers to the target file.  Is there a way to copy the msg while excluding all headers that don't appear when viewing a msg?
[00:25:05] <ciphrCat> an organization has asked me to give them 100+ messages.
[00:25:34] <ciphrCat> i used grepmail to create an mbox file with all those msgs, which naturally includes all headers
[00:26:03] <ciphrCat> mutt may not be the best tool for this
[00:27:10] <ciphrCat> maybe a formail filter is better
[00:28:54] <flatcap> searching using `~b` only searches the body -- it'd be fairly quick for local mail...
[00:30:16] <flatcap> alternatively, '|' <pipe-message>, I think, has an option to only pass the headers you'd see in the pager
[00:31:23] <flatcap> you'll want: `set pipe_decode = yes`  `set pipe_decode_weed = yes`
[00:33:00] <ciphrCat> pipe works indeed.. just piped to "cat > somefile.txt" and it produced a minimal set of headers.  Now I just need to try that on 100+ tagged msgs
[00:33:13] *** Joins: blaub (~blaub@194-208-201-025.tele.net)
[00:33:27] <flatcap> pipe should work ok with tag
[00:34:43] <ciphrCat> yup, it worked.  Thanks!
[00:35:00] <flatcap> np
[00:37:34] <ciphrCat> is mbox the best format for this, assuming the org that requested the emails is in the tech industry?  I guess if it were a non-tech org I'd be trying to get the msgs into PDF perhaps using wkhtmltopdf.
[00:39:14] <flatcap> yeah, mbox is simplest
[00:56:39] <ciphrCat> looks like the HTML gets stripped by pipe-message
[00:57:15] <ciphrCat> normally that's ideal, but in this case i guess mutt can't help
[00:59:20] <flatcap> ah, well
[00:59:46] <ciphrCat> and it looks like formail can't do this job either… formail can force some headers to be included, but it can't strip headers
[01:00:53] <ciphrCat> i think i can selectively strip out headers with formail by including a blank header, but then i have to name all the headers i want stripped
[01:04:19] <ciphrCat> this procmail hack may be the answer → https://www.mhonarc.org/archive/html/procmail/2005-07/msg00265.html
[01:06:10] <flatcap> ok
[01:06:35] <elshize> flatcap: actually something I meant to bring up: ~b was terribly slow on my local maildir; granted, there were many emails, but I found it much slower than mblaze, which surprised me that there's such a difference
[01:08:37] <elshize> (talking about limiting, so when it searches for all matching emails)
[01:10:06] <ciphrCat> i might have to give mblaze a try.  I use grepmail and that's quite slow as well
[01:10:37] <flatcap> do you have the header cache enabled?
[01:11:13] <elshize> from my measurements, when I limit messages in my archive with ~b and for one term, it's about 200 times slower than with mblaze (looking through body)
[01:11:46] <ciphrCat> ah, nevermind.. mblaze is Maildir only
[01:12:02] <elshize> flatcap: I'm not sure, but how does that help with body search? not sure if I understand what header cache does
[01:12:52] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@2806:265:5401:8cd:18b:fa2e:c948:1d68)
[01:12:58] <flatcap> it caches the contents of the headers in a database, so neomutt doesn't need to parse them each time
[01:13:09] <elshize> ah
[01:13:22] <elshize> let me check
[01:14:32] <elshize> so I have `header_cache` and `message_cachedir` paths set
[01:14:43] <elshize> is there an additional flag that needs to be on or just the paths?
[01:15:18] <flatcap> no, that should be enough
[01:15:33] *** Parts: ciphrCat (~ciphrCat@user/ciphrcat) ()
[01:17:03] <elshize> I can see the header cache file
[01:17:32] <elshize> anyway, this is not a big deal for me ever since I set up notmuch
[01:17:37] <flatcap> if it's built into neomutt, then lmdb is a fast choice of database
[01:17:40] <flatcap> set header_cache_backend = "lmdb"
[01:17:52] <flatcap> yeah, notmuch will always win :-)
[01:19:18] <elshize> yeah, I used to use other clients with notmuch, but I prefer to have regular maildir with only keyword search backed by notmuch, this setup seems to work for me best, and I managed to set it up in neomutt
[01:20:29] <elshize> anyway, not complaining about speed, just thought i'd mention it; as far as i know mblaze doesn't cache anything in db, and still is super fast (I mean, relatively, not even close to notmuch)
[01:21:02] <elshize> goes through 25k messages in about 15 seconds, which is not bad
[01:23:22] <flatcap> yeah

[02:04:19] <dcpurton> For the hard one: I mentioned in the PR, I think I'll write a `find_body_previous()` function.
[02:04:46] <dcpurton> This needs recursion, and I've often tried to workaround this by counting backwards and checking levels, which can be done in a single loop.
[02:05:15] <flatcap> yeah, sounds good
[02:05:16] <dcpurton> But it's obviously not reliably enough. And a proper function to get the previous body will be much better
[02:05:48] <flatcap> I've just updated the bad2.rc test case.  I've managed to simplify it further
[02:06:09] <flatcap> the README.md shows diagrams before and after
[02:06:14] <dcpurton> Ta
[02:06:23] <dcpurton> I'll look it at.
[02:07:06] <flatcap> also, I've pushed my automation code to flatcap/compose (just a couple of commits)...
[02:07:14] <flatcap> ./configure --debug-compose
[02:07:16] <dcpurton> Cool
[02:07:41] <flatcap> it does 1000 runs of 100 random operations in compose: add file, group file, move up/down, delete file
[02:08:15] <flatcap> I've done several thousand tests and it's only crashed at bad2 and in my code (now fixed :-)
[02:09:05] <flatcap> to run the test code, you just need to enter the compose screen -- it's very hard-coded, atm
[02:09:26] <dcpurton> BTW, with your delete_attachment fix
[02:09:41] <flatcap> it logs every ACTION: that it performs so you can convert that into push commands
[02:09:47] <flatcap> yeah?  it was just quick hack
[02:10:07] <flatcap> just so I could keep on automating
[02:10:39] <dcpurton> It's fine, but do you care that the first test (actx->idxlen == 1) should (in theory) be caught by the second
[02:11:07] <dcpurton> If it's not, it's an indication of some other problem elsewhere
[02:11:17] <flatcap> oh yes, good point
[02:11:52] <flatcap> my only worry was if it was safe to dereference `actx->idx[0]`

[15:23:42] <flatcap> hi adray 
[15:29:21] <adray> how's it going?
[15:32:09] <flatcap> good thanks.  busy, but not with my own work...
[15:32:45] <flatcap> been inventing creative methods to break dcpurton's compose/attachment code :-)
[15:32:56] <dcpurton> Ack
[15:33:05] <flatcap> it's nearly ready for prime time!
[15:33:14] <flatcap> hi dcpurton :-)
[15:33:25] <dcpurton> I just put in a find_body_previous() and now it crashes again :(
[15:33:35] <flatcap> oh :-(
[15:33:49] <dcpurton> but I have high hopes that eventually this wil help
[15:34:04] <flatcap> good
[15:34:28] <flatcap> anything you need from me?
[15:35:07] <flatcap> adray: how are you?  did you get anywhere with the tri-state notmuch config?
[15:38:42] <adray> i'm doing well; starting my new job today so that's a bit nerve-racking
[15:39:09] <bremner> adray: btw, did you see my patches for the memory leak? No big hurry, just curious if they got lost.
[15:39:43] <flatcap> ooh, good luck
[15:40:34] <adray> not as far as i'd like. admittedly, i got a bit frustrated working on it since there's quite a few checks preventing an empty string. i'll pick the work back up later this week
[15:41:06] <adray> bremner: i saw the emails, but haven't read them. i'll check them out sometime this week
[15:41:12] <adray> flatcap: thanks, i appreciate it
[15:42:51] <bremner> adray: sure, as I say no panic. I want to freeze for 0.35 in a few weeks, so before then would be good.

[18:21:03] <dcpurton> flatcap: I've changed (yet again) how the grouping code works. It's supposed to get better every time, but who knows.
[18:21:23] <dcpurton> It works for all the errors you have found
[18:21:26] <dcpurton> and my tests
[18:21:36] <dcpurton> But I haven't checked you random automated ones

[19:28:28] <artagnon> honza: I think we can write a feature to merge Sent with INBOX, picking out the correct Reply-To MessageIDs and displaying a richer thread. We should be able to search by MessageID fairly quickly, but I think we need a new `spool_file_aux` configuration option to specify the Sent spool to merge into the main spool.

[20:57:16] <honza> artagnon: flatcap: thanks
[20:57:23] <flatcap> np
[20:58:09] <honza> i keep hearing things about virtual inboxes so i guess i should give it a try
[20:58:09] <flatcap> artagnon: thanks for the PR.  so you want to store username/password (sort of things)?
[20:58:29] <artagnon> flatcap: Yeah.
[20:58:32] <flatcap> if your mail's local, then notmuch is very powerful
[20:58:58] <artagnon> I want to avoid putting the password in the plaintext file, even if it's GPG encrypted.
[20:59:17] <flatcap> artagnon: ok, that makes sense.  I'll have to find some mac users to help
[20:59:20] <artagnon> git and pine both use Keychain on macOS.
[20:59:45] <flatcap> ah, ok
[21:01:05] <flatcap> Linux's Gnome has a similar keychain, unlocked when you loging

[21:03:06] <flatcap> I don't know how much of NeoMutt's code you've read (some of it's quite scary), but...
[21:03:54] <flatcap> there are `struct Account`, which has private data, `struct ImapAccountData`, which has a `struct Connection` ...
[21:04:36] <flatcap> when you open a folder, there's a callback to get credentials (or unlock a keychain)
[21:04:56] <flatcap> so, in theory, adding your keychain shouldn't be too complicated
[21:05:03] * flatcap chuckles
[21:07:45] <flatcap> are there cli tools to extract a password?

[21:56:45] <JulienTant> Also, is there a way to "combine" a color for index+indicator? I would like to have something that says when the indicator is above a line in the index, reverse the color (pseudo code `color index_indicator reverse default default`)
[21:57:08] <flatcap> not yet. possibly next release
[21:57:51] <JulienTant> Cool! Thank you for your work on neomutt, I'm having a pretty good time customizing it lol
[21:58:01] <flatcap> branch [flatcap/colour] is a WIP, but it allows merging colours

[22:03:04] <artagnon> I'm having trouble finding the code location of the date-display in the index view. This is rather embarrassing :\
[22:04:12] <artagnon> flatcap: Thanks for the heads up!
[22:06:48] <artagnon> I looked at the callers of mutt_date_localtime_format, and there seems to be only one relevant one in browser.c
[22:06:58] <artagnon> Unless vscode is broken.
[22:08:01] <artagnon> I don't get it -- doesn't every display require to display the time in a localized manner? Whether it's a local directory, IMAP server, or NNTP server.

[23:10:03] <flatcap> artagnon: have a look at index_format_str() in hdrline.c -- case 'd' and beyond...
[23:10:46] <flatcap> quite a few of the expando-format (%x) functions aren't called directly, but by passing a formatting function as a parameter
[23:12:04] <flatcap> mutt_expando_format() is the engine
[23:12:08] <artagnon> Wonderful! I kept searching for mutt_date_localtime_format, and completely missed mutt_date_localtime :P Thanks :)

[23:51:50] <JulienTant> I do use a macro to refresh my emails by called a custom script, it's working fine. I tried to use the exact same code into a timeout-hook but it's failing with this message: "<shell-escape>~/.local/bin/sync-mail: unknown command". My config looks like this: `timeout-hook '<shell-escape>~/.local/bin/sync-mail &> /dev/null &<enter><sync-mailbox><check-stats>'` - is <shell-escape> not allowed here?
