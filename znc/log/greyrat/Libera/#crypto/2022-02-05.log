[00:24:29] <sarnold> oh no
[00:24:34] <sarnold> I'm already doing three wordles a day
[00:25:00] <yawkat> ive avoided it so far, but cant avoid this one.

[00:25:41] <sarnold> yeah these are *so* long..
[00:26:13] <sarnold> omg and you *have* to use the letters you got right on the previous line! it's nothing like real wordle
[00:26:18] <hg> I feel like there's a balance
[00:26:28] <yawkat> sarnold: i think thats called hard mode
[00:26:46] <hg> on the one hand, it's harder to come up with candidate words because they're so much longer (and there are just fewer words that long)
[00:26:59] <hg> on the other hand, the likelihood of revealing more letters-per-guess goes way up
[00:27:08] <sarnold> yawkat: oh hmm I never clicked around much in the 'usual' wordles
[00:27:13] <hg> yawkat: which I think is rather poorly named; I think “strict mode” would be much more accurate
[00:27:36] <hg> yawkat: it's also not completely strict (e.g., it still allows you to guess words with greyed letters)
[00:28:13] <yawkat> yes i think this one allows you to place other letters too

[00:55:43] <wasamasa> chainsaws work once you figure out how to use them

[00:56:40] <kashire> Who needs to be an expert. Pointy end away from body. vroom time.
[00:56:54] <wasamasa> one thing I like about john is that it comes with these whatever2john scripts
[00:57:06] <wasamasa> I'm not sure whether the same exists for hashcat
[00:57:19] <wasamasa> but it sure helps getting the format of the hash right
[00:57:49] <SlimmyJimmy> Yes, it's not needed for my case. It is if you're trying to crack KeePass which I started to do but failed.
[00:59:48] <wasamasa> I keep seeing tutorials where people tell you to use the john script and edit the output for hashcat, so I guess not
[01:00:30] <SlimmyJimmy> Oh, right, I remember that from the KeePass attempt. It was an easy edit.
[01:01:28] <SlimmyJimmy> John gives you something Like $KeePass$:<hash here>, you just remove the beginning $KeePass$ part.
