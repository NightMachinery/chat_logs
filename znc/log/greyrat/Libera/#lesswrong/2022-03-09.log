[00:24:10] <two2thehead> Betawolf, yeesh
[00:24:38] <two2thehead> gwern, I guess today's executive order was the kick in the pants US Shale needed to start up
[00:24:39] <galambo> my landlord pays the bills. Im surprised they havent negotiated our contract yet
[00:24:59] <ggreer> fun fact: drag racing in the US is run by the NHRA. their safety rules dictate that if your car can run a 1/4 mile in under 11.5 seconds, you need a roll bar and 5 point restraints. if your car does a quarter mile in less than 10 seconds, you need a chassis certification and competition license
[00:25:10] <ggreer> if your car finishes the quarter mile with a top speed over 150mph, you need a parachute
[00:25:10] <galambo> (I tend to turn down heating and wear jackets while at home though)
[00:25:32] <Betawolf> this is day-ahead pricing, which is not what households usually pay
[00:25:38] <ggreer> the model s plaid does a quarter mile in 9.3 seconds with a top speed over 155mph. so you'll get kicked out if you take it to a drap strip
[00:25:39] <Betawolf> but some businesses do

[00:26:09] <two2thehead> 'National Hot Rod Association'
[00:26:10] <ggreer> the model 3 performance does it in the low 11 seconds, so you'll get kicked out for not having a roll bar

[06:39:02] <Betawolf> yeah, the nazi militias in Ukraine are real and were a focus of a few pieces by western journalists before now (those journalists mostly keeping quiet now I guess), but the idea that they're a key invasion goal is hilarious
[06:39:26] <nshepperd2> i'd say i prefer the ukrainian government to the russian one, but like other than that
[06:39:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Probably yeah
[06:39:52] <Betawolf> this conflict is so hard because on the one hand invading places is cool, but on the other hand I want the far-right nationalists to win.
[06:39:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Ukrainian government as it stands now and lately seems mostly just corrupt and kleptocratic but not *that* much?
[06:40:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, Zelensky is lining his pockets, funneling millions into offshore accounts, ok, but as far as anyone can tell that's probably the worst that he and his administration have done
[06:40:51] <nshepperd2> right
[06:40:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> No polonium assassinations, no defenestration sprees
[06:41:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not a tough choice imo
[06:41:26] <nshepperd2> only light oppression of lgbt people
[06:41:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: What if I told you
[06:41:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: That they're *all* far-right nationalists
[06:41:46] <Betawolf> can the world be so kind?
[06:41:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> It can! It is!
[06:42:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can root for anyone you like, and either way, the far-right nationalists win!

[06:42:30] <Betawolf> truly, the lord Hitler-Squared provides
[06:43:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile... seeing a lot of people discussing sanctions ... can they work (most people say no), etc. ... and it just seems like... ok, so the main sticking point is, how much economic hardship will the Russian people tolerate, before they rise up and overthrow Putin. Right?
[06:43:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let's just ask that again
[06:43:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> How much economic hardship
[06:43:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Will the RUSSIAN people tolerate
[06:44:02] <nshepperd2> hmm
[06:44:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Do we have any historical data to answer this?? I feel like we just might
[06:44:31] <Betawolf> The sanctions might materially affect the war effort, but perhaps a lot slower than some people think

[06:47:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: As far as "oppression of lgbt people", yeah, someone (on ACX or DSL, I forget) made that point in response to Scott's hilarious "how Westernized and democratic are Ukrainians - super very Westernized or maybe super duper ultra Westernized??" - like, dude, the opinions of the average Ukrainian "man on the street" about race, immigration, sexuality, gender, etc., etc., would make him, like, further right than 100% of
[06:47:11] <Obormot\Arcturus>  all American politicians, even the extra-crazy ones
[06:47:31] <Betawolf> Those lists of oligarchs being targeted by name are basically Western leaders attempting to put together a team.
[06:49:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, I hear gas prices in some parts of the U.S. are up to $7/gal.
[06:50:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Turns out banning imports of Russian oil has economic consequences!
[06:50:26] <nshepperd2> yeah
[06:50:37] <adiabatic> I've only seen $6/gal memes
[06:50:42] <adiabatic> is it $7/gal in LA yet
[06:50:48] <Betawolf> Don't worry, the US can import more oil from their friends in *checks notes*... Venezuela?
[06:51:14] <adiabatic> mexico
[06:51:18] <adiabatic> mexico has lots of oil too
[06:51:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "“We’re moving forward with this ban understanding that many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us,” [Biden] said. “The United States produces far more oil domestically than all of Europe. So we can take this step when others cannot.”
[06:51:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> But he said the US was working closely with Europe to develop a long-term strategy to reduce dependence on Russian energy, adding that the crisis could spur the Western transition to renewable energy."
[06:51:37] <nshepperd2> Mohammed bin Salman can cough up a bit more to subsidize our uber rides
[06:51:39] <adiabatic> we buy lots from them though already
[06:52:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's your key line, guys
[06:52:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> This "could spur the Western transition to renewable energy", allegedly!
[06:52:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Therefore we have much broader political support
[06:52:45] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: sounds like the "don't like it? build your own …" Stonetoss comic, only the Russians have a chance of doing it as long as they can sell oil and gas

[06:52:57] <nshepperd2> -politicians, 20 years ago
[06:54:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Apparently we're also gonna cut off trade with Chinese companies that sell chips and stuff to Russia
[06:55:41] <nshepperd2> we'll make our own china
[06:55:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which, to me, kinda sounds like "we will forbid our two biggest rivals from trading with each other, and one of them from trading with us; this definitely won't result in driving them closer together"

I am trying to display all the flaws in the photo. The state in the photo. Look at the real photos! You get what. I will be glad to cooperate.)
[12:00:55] <synthmeat> "stainless steel" is a thousand things with wildly different characteristics
[12:01:02] <kuudes> and washing cutting surfaces is better for hygiene
[12:01:14] <kuudes> what was it, listeria and salmonella
[12:01:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Research shows that wooden cutting boards have superior antibacterial properties to plastic ones
[12:01:50] <synthmeat> i mean, i obviously do wash it if i cut nasty shit on it, but doesn't wood kinda choke the bacteria?
[12:01:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> ^
[12:02:05] <kuudes> it is not alcohol
[12:02:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> (To be precise, the bacteria are sucked into the wood, where they die)
[12:02:34] <nshepperd2> people assume that plastic cutting boards are better against bacteria because of a superficial appearance of cleanliness
[12:02:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But in fact they're much worse)
[12:02:45] <kuudes> but. local customs differ because local environments differ. usa washes eggs iirc and uk does not
[12:02:50] <spxtr> no, they're better because you can put them in the dishwasher
[12:02:55] <kuudes> nshepperd2, they need to be cleaned
[12:02:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[12:03:10] <nshepperd2> kuudes: yes indeed
[12:03:13] <spxtr> hot, soapy water for hours does good work against bacteria
[12:03:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... after every use?
[12:03:36] <synthmeat> and in plastic surfaces, those cuts aren't bacteria death traps like in wood, they're breeding grounds
[12:03:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> ^
[12:03:50] <nshepperd2> and the result is worse because bacteria who get into the crevices in the plastic from constant cutting survive instead of dying
[12:03:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> yep
[12:04:19] <spxtr> yes after every use, because the only cost of washing your cutting board is like 5 seconds to put it in the dishwasher and 5 seconds to take it out
[12:04:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> So what I'm hearing is that you don't cook much
[12:04:55] <spxtr> I have a set of 5 plastic cutting boards so there's always 2 or 3 in the dishwasher and 2 or 3 outside
[12:05:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ridiculous
[12:05:06] <spxtr> very efficient
[12:05:16] <synthmeat> i have one big and one small wood surface. i barely use the small one.
[12:05:54] <synthmeat> if i had a nice big butcher block, that'd be all i use ever.
[12:07:11] <Ralith> yeah my dishwasher is way too full of plates and bowls and stuff to waste space on 5 cutting boards
[12:08:06] <synthmeat> i'm much more worried about my sponges, tbh
[12:08:41] <spxtr> Ralith: there's only ever a couple in there at a time, and they're small. They take one plate spot each, more or less.
[12:09:17] <Ralith> your cutting boards are too small
[12:09:38] <spxtr> that may be so
[12:09:44] <spxtr> they're very convenient, though

[12:56:56] <capisce> too bad once your BMR drops you can't just stop eating PUFAs to reboot it, since the PUFA already stored in your adipose tissue sabotages the process

(https://nitter.ca/pic/media%2FFNW93HQUUAEj4D5.jpg)
[13:11:12] <PapuaHardyNet> this "trans teens should have access to hormones" is a "scissor" topic. I feel guilt for either opinion, and I can imagine people hurt either way
[13:11:38] <saturn2> this seems like a topic for #lw-politics
[13:12:39] <PapuaHardyNet> I very much agree
[13:13:04] <capisce> true
[13:15:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: The solution is to stop, forever, caring what other people think of your opinions
[13:16:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just remember that you have a right to think whatever you want, even if it's like Nazi shit or something, and if anyone says otherwise, fuck 'em, they're assholes and you owe them nothing
[13:17:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then, once you internalize this fact, contemplate the additional and further fact that on most topics, having *any* opinion, at all, in support of any "side", actually affects nothing, because your "vote" doesn't count and your actions do not affect whatever it is
[13:17:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Therefore just as you're free to have any opinion, you're equally free to have no opinion at all
[13:18:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Thereby banish all guilt about your opinions, or lack thereof, on any and all topics whatsoever
[13:23:14] <PapuaHardyNet> I do care
[13:23:34] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't want people to suffer.
[13:24:04] <PapuaHardyNet> But what you are saying is very, very realpolitik, and I will try to learn to follow your advice
[13:24:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're missing the point
[13:24:53] *** Quits: phill_ (uid429774@id-429774.ilkley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[13:25:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am saying that you can "not want people to suffer" all you like, but there's no actual connection between that and caring what people think about your opinions
[13:25:15] <Otthorn[m]> Arcturus: You seem to put a large difference between opinion and action. But I believe that they are highly linked. Someone with nazi idelogy (to take your example) is more likely to take actions that align with their ideas.
[13:25:19] <PapuaHardyNet> I feel guilty when I imagine someone suffering *because* of what happens if my opinion becomes reality
[13:25:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Arcturus is the name of the computer I'm on)
[13:25:39] <PapuaHardyNet> it's about a trans teen, not about some random loser calling me names and ostracizing me
[13:25:55] <Otthorn[m]> my bad
[13:26:04] <kuudes> I try to send money toward things I care about
[13:26:21] <kuudes> recently I have sent money to ukraine's armed forces, so that they can shoot more
[13:26:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: That's a reason to take (or not take) certain actions, it is not a reason to give other people the right to dictate what thoughts you think
[13:27:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Most people have a really hard time distinguishing between these things, but there's an absolutely ironclad separation, and if you lose sight of it you will accomplish nothing except torturing yourself to absolutely no purpose
[13:29:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Otthorn[m]: That is only relevant if you think that ideas and thoughts are like some sort of external agents that can come into your brain and make you do things you prefer not to do
[13:29:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Otthorn[m]: If you do not think that, then the thing you said doesn't have any bearing on my point
[13:30:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> In other words, what if I see someone I don't like, on the street, and I want to punch them? Is that wrong? Wanting to punch them?
[13:30:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> No.
[13:30:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it wrong to think about punching them?
[13:30:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> No.
[13:30:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it wrong to punch them?
[13:30:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes.
[13:30:56] <Otthorn[m]> Maybe I misunderstood your point then. But I think it is more clear with this example thanks
[13:31:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> But won't thinking about punching them make it more likely that I'll punch them? Notice that *however you answer this question*, it does not actually change the fact that *doing the thing* is what is actually wrong
[13:32:42] <synthmeat> that sounds like a surface level thinking through it though. people will absolutely try to figure out what you think, and punish you if they deem it wrong.
[13:32:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course
[13:32:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> They totally will
[13:32:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that's wrong
[13:33:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> And *that* should be punished
[13:33:39] <synthmeat> but it's frequently not and we're talking realpolitik stuff here (at least it was mentioned)
[13:33:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not by me :p
[13:34:05] <Otthorn[m]> I guess its the whole point of "Presumption of innocence"
[13:34:08] <PapuaHardyNet> well, our discussion spans multiple points and I'll try elaborating. I care about the *thing* (I don't want trans teens to suffer because I empathize, which is why any opinion I have of this makes me feel guilt because someone will get fucked). I don't care what the public thinks about my *opinions* (so I don't talk about it with people). I care about what people I respect think about my opinions (which is why I'm talking to you about this).
[13:34:23] <Otthorn[m]> People can think whatever they want at least they do not act

[13:34:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: No! No one will get fucked! This is what I'm trying to tell you! Your opinion doesn't affect anything about this situation at all!
[13:35:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can literally be the most hateful person ever, you can sit there all day just thinking about how much you hate trans people, *and that will affect nothing* and will cause no one to suffer (except yourself possibly)
[13:36:32] <PapuaHardyNet> fuck, that's a worse thought, the powerlessness
[13:36:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, perhaps. But it has the virtue of being true :p
[13:37:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is indeed hard for many people to accept, but: thoughts aren't magic, and you can neither cause harm by sinful thoughts, nor - and this is key - do good by virtuous thoughts
[13:37:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> You just cannot
[13:38:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> You want consequences, you gotta act. No way around it
[13:38:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> And don't think of it as powerlessness, anyhow; think of it as liberation
[13:38:30] <synthmeat> again too idealistic, i guess. "thinking" leaks through, and given enough people thinking similar "bad thoughts", it can spiral out of control extremely easily. that's why they want to control and police what you think :)
[13:38:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: Nah
[13:39:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: Perfectly possible to think and not speak... :p
[13:39:18] <synthmeat> it's quite literally modus operandi of every major goverment in last at least half a century
[13:39:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do not agree with your characterization
[13:39:49] <synthmeat> well, i'd have trouble hiding absolute disdain of something. my body language would betray me.
[13:40:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think you overestimate the degree to which people can tell what you're thinking
[13:41:33] <PapuaHardyNet> see, my beliefs always have a policy behind it. I won't hate a certain person without actually having implicit policies of how I behave with them in mind.
[13:41:53] <PapuaHardyNet> a belief without a policy is about as useless as an overripe banana
[13:41:59] <PapuaHardyNet> beliefs must pay rent
[13:41:59] <saturn2> you shouldn't feel guilty about your thoughts, but it can make sense to feel ashamed of your thoughts
[13:42:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, of course; "beliefs are for actions", as gwern puts it
[13:42:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Well... perhaps, but I think that's an advanced moral technique, as it were
[13:42:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: The "don't feel guilty about your thoughts" really must be internalized first
[13:43:00] <saturn2> sure
[13:43:12] <nshepperd2> overripe bananas are quite useful, you can make them into bread
[13:43:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, or smoothies
[13:43:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Man now I'm thinking about how I miss bananas...)
[13:44:44] <saturn2> anyway, it's undesirable to eliminate all suffering
[13:44:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also true)
[13:45:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Anyway, the thing I was saying before: this is not powerlessness but liberation. You are forever excused from having to manage the contents of your thoughts with an eye toward their effects on others, because there are no such effects. Therefore you are free to think whatever thoughts are necessary or useful to think in order to achieve your actual external goals!
[13:47:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Let's say you want to help a bunch of people in some way. But oh no, to do this, it is somehow helpful or even necessary to think "problematic" thoughts! No problem at all, because you can think whatever thoughts you damn well please and it's 100% ok. Only actions and consequences matter
[13:48:13] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, yeah I'll do that
[13:48:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And, of course, this allows you to, without the slightest guilt or concern, make all best efforts to believe *true* things)
[13:48:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And thereby to become... less wrong)
[13:49:01] <capisce> but should you disclose those beliefs when people ask you for the reason behind your actions?
[13:49:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> capisce: That's a complicated question and the answer is necessarily situation-dependent
[13:49:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sometimes yes, sometimes no
[13:49:27] <nshepperd2> only if doing so is tactically advantageous
[13:49:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, and/or in accordance with other principles you might have, such as apply to the matter
[13:50:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's perfectly permissible to value honesty, for example (but also totally permissible (and indeed recommended) to have an understanding of honesty that doesn't involve never saying literal falsehoods, etc.)
[13:51:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> capisce: Perhaps the most general useful answer that can be given here is "you do not have a universal obligation to tell people your reasons for your actions"
[13:52:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sometimes, contextually, you do! But as some sort of general, like, moral rule? Nah
[13:52:11] <synthmeat> ok. if we play along, brainwashing is perfectly moral. after all, you're not influencing anything but thoughts of others!
[13:52:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> -_-
[13:52:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who said anything about influencing or not influencing thoughts of others?
[13:52:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did I say such a thing? No
[13:52:48] <PapuaHardyNet> influencing the thoughts of others is an act. See: grooming
[13:52:52] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: personally, 'natural' puberty was the worst thing that ever happened to me, so i certainly wish i had access to puberty blockers back then
[13:53:11] <saturn2> trying to completely remove yourself from any form of culpability for anyone's suffering is about like trying to leap out of your own skin
[13:53:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure, yeah, but pretending that you're potentially culpable for the suffering of anyone about whom you have any information is at least as silly
[13:54:00] <synthmeat> no, i understand it's an act. but it's not influencing anything but other people's thoughts, and that is supposedly irrelevant, only their actions matter.
[13:54:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> And possibly sillier
[13:54:20] <synthmeat> this would make brainwashing noop
[13:54:37] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: this is exactly what I mean - I worry that I might be responsible or can influence the decisions of a trans person and I want to do my very best to not have them suffer. My thoughts aren't problematic, it is the fact that I may have the power to prevent suffering but did not, that is
[13:54:55] <capisce> Obormot\Arcturus: true, often it seems better not to give your true reason, to avoid getting into culture wars
[13:54:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: No, it would not, because modifying something nonconsensually can be wrong even if that something can take on any particular value without moral implications
[13:56:02] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: well idk what you may or may not be able to do about it personally, possibly the answer is nothing
[13:56:56] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: if you're influencing a specific person you should probably focus on that person rather than generalizing about all "trans teens"
[13:56:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: It's like: am I allowed to eat any (or no) flavor of ice cream, morally speaking? Yes, totally, vanilla is ok and strawberry is also ok and hating ice cream is also ok. But what if you force-feed me strawberry ice cream, is that bad? Duh, yes. But why, if strawberry ice cream is perfectly permissible morally???
[13:57:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: See how dumb that scenario is? Well, it's the same as your "brainwashing" thing... :\
[13:57:20] <nshepperd2> yes that too
[13:57:21] <PapuaHardyNet> I dislike the idea of "leaning into my powerlessness", but yeah, I think I might consider it, since what obormot says makes sense. that is also liberation
[13:57:50] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: perfect. I should stop worrying so much about a generalization
[13:58:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Let me be clear - the whole "think of it as liberation" thing is a way to accept the fact, but it's a fact regardless of whether you accept it or how you do so
[13:58:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> In fact you cannot affect most things - that's just how it is
[13:59:06] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, it's just hard to accept, you know? it is so much more easier to continue when you believe you matter, when your actions matter
[13:59:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: You should read namespace's thing about this
[13:59:49] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, do you have a link? I'm unfamiliar with namespace's literature

One scenario is that the conflict is contained and reaches some equilibrium. In that situation, stocks go up.

[21:45:46] <kuudes> aaa
[21:46:02] <ggreer> seems like the best compromise would be "kids can do X as long as their parents are ok with it"
[21:46:46] <feep> aaaaand suddenly I'm fine with the AI apocalypse!
[21:47:08] <ggreer> I'm also fine with this applying to things like cosmetic surgery, tattoos, etc
[21:47:28] <capisce> ggreer: how about ufai?
[21:47:47] <ggreer> what? what does that have to do about the idaho anti trans bill?
[21:48:00] <zebrask> I feel like there's a decent amount of low hanging fruit in terms of disaster preparedness that I should do (and to some extent I do it), but one thing that's annoying is that I'd really like to buy like a month's worth of food and eat it oldest first (since this is just storage costs), but most of the stuff that I actually eat is not shelf stable.
[21:48:05] <capisce> I mean if kids should be allowed to do it
[21:48:31] <ggreer> might as well ask if kids should have access to nukes. it's a silly question
[21:48:35] <zebrask> My diet is mostly cottage cheese, yogurt, fresh fruit and vegetables and meat. I eat rice and grains in moderation and very little pasta.
[21:48:52] <ggreer> zebrask: do you go camping often? that should give you some idea of what sort of gear you'd probably need
[21:49:08] <zebrask> ggreer: I don't ever go camping.
[21:49:24] <ggreer> also what kind of disaster are you preparing for? earthquake? urban riot? flood? etc
[21:49:47] <capisce> keeping kids from doing stuff will just make them want to do it even more
[21:50:19] <ggreer> the main risk where I live is megathrust earthquake. that means all infrastructure on this side of washington/oregon gets destroyed. roads are out. water's out. electricity obviously gone
[21:50:32] *** Joins: schmudde (~schmudde@2001:b07:ae6:7d19:63f0:cd64:66b4:636d)
[21:50:40] <zebrask> ggreer: I'm not necessarily looking to prepare for a specific disaster, I'm saying that there are probably things where the cost is very low with a bit of foresight and the potential benefit in rare situations is disproportionately high.
[21:50:56] <capisce> zebrask: beans might be an ok protein source with a long shelf life
[21:51:33] <zebrask> Like if you already have a big house and 60-70% of your calories comes from shelf stable foods already, the cost of just buying a month's worth of food and consuming it in a buffered way is ridiculously low.
[21:52:30] <ggreer> I have about 20 gallons of water stored, some emergency food, some flashlights, some basic cold weather gear, some usb batteries (to power my phone & laptop for a few days)
[21:52:59] <capisce> you could buy cheap shelf stable foods that last a long time, without necessarily planning to eat them if you don't have to
[21:53:06] <ggreer> have you ever tried to eat a cold can of beans? not fun. also messy
[21:53:17] <zebrask> I used to keep a canister of gasoline in my garage and use it to refuel my motorcycle. Whenever it got low I'd just pop it in my truck and refill it, and I always had some spare gas.
[21:53:21] <capisce> and then when they're about to expire buy a new batch
[21:53:33] <ggreer> gasoline gets old. water gets in it. also some of the chemicals separate

[21:53:57] <Robomot> SpaceX
[21:53:58] <capisce> you mainly need carbs and protein I guess
[21:54:04] <zebrask> ggreer: Yeah, but I was actively using enough gasoline that that didn't come up, and I had a ready store if I needed it.
[21:54:04] <kuudes> oh yeah, it went
[21:54:33] <ggreer> my motorcycle is carb'd so it'll run on shitty gas. fuel injectors might get clogged though
[21:54:44] <zebrask> capisce: Yeah but the cost of buying food you would only eat in a disaster is significantly-enough higher than the cost of maintaining a buffer of food you already eat.
[21:54:54] <ggreer> I'd do some threat modeling instead of generic disaster preparedness
[21:55:20] <capisce> zebrask: sure, but then you don't have to compromise as much
[21:55:37] <zebrask> I think you guys are missing the point.
[21:55:53] <ggreer> because while there are some universal basics, the details are important 
[21:56:53] <zebrask> I'm not looking to be prepared for disasters, that's something I'm considering as well but it's easy enough to approach it ­— do threat modelling  like ggreer suggests and prepare for the disasters that you think are likely and where preparation is cost effective.
[21:57:15] <ggreer> I'd just prepare for a 3-4 day power/water outage. you're guaranteed to experience one of those at some point in your life
[21:58:12] <capisce> ggreer: how do you keep your usb batteries charged?
[21:58:27] <zebrask> I'm saying that there is a whole other class of thing where it's effectively free or nearly free to prepare for stuff, so you barely have to consider the potential benefits.
[21:58:27] <ggreer> when I'm camping? a solar panel. otherwise they're usually charged
[21:59:42] <zebrask> Like if you are a regular camper you could just have your camping stuff ready to go. You know you are going to spend the time preparing it next time you go camping anyway, and there *will* be a next time, so have it packed and ready to go in the basement and you get a "bugout bag" for free.
[22:00:30] <ggreer> https://geoff.greer.fm/photos/idaho_hot_springs_loop_2016/DSC_0112.jpg <-- the solar panel is strapped to the back of my bike. it fully charged a 75 watt-hour battery over the day

[22:02:12] <capisce> ggreer: nice
[22:03:07] <ggreer> you also probably want an am/fm radio and a cb radio

[23:36:22] <feep> grah!
[23:36:40] <feep> there's a part of my mind that takes in theories and digests them
[23:36:52] <feep> digestion means either they become part of my body (mental), or they are destroyed
[23:36:57] <feep> yes I'm still on salbianism
[23:37:01] <two2thehead> hm
[23:37:04] <two2thehead> so binary
[23:37:17] <two2thehead> so binary?
[23:37:17] <feep> I think I may need to write a post titled "Destroying Salbianism"?
[23:37:29] <two2thehead> ah, accepts them or rejects them
[23:37:34] <feep> no
[23:37:41] <two2thehead> I was thinking along the lines of retain in memory
[23:37:44] <feep> incorporates them or *destroys* them
[23:37:49] <feep> rejection is not sufficient
[23:37:57] <two2thehead> sure
[23:38:07] <feep> that which can be destroyed by the truth should be: conversely, that which is not the truth must itself be destroyed.
[23:38:34] <Betawolf> that doesn't follow
[23:38:36] <feep> rejection is the very thing that salbianism notes as a coping strategy
[23:38:51] <two2thehead> the converse seems kinda out there
[23:38:55] <feep> if salbianism is to be defeated, it must be unmade with its own axioms. I believe this is possible
[23:39:06] <two2thehead> also, what's salbianism? :V

[23:39:33] <two2thehead> ah
[23:39:51] <feep> I think it's a real thing, there's a lot of commenters writing they recognize the impulse
[23:40:03] <feep> I think it's a specific miscoupling of the symmetry sense to moral impulse
[23:40:18] <Betawolf> wasn't the moral of that story that obsessing about internet fiction makes you gay?
[23:40:28] <feep> I'm bi
[23:40:34] <Betawolf> see, it's started
[23:40:44] <feep> little of A causes B, little of B causes A
[23:41:24] <feep> anyway, I think the core of the attack has to be that the notion that correct action is thankless deconstructs the role of pain in its description
[23:41:44] <feep> using this we can decouple the whole bleak thankless world from reverse face instruction entirely
[23:42:03] <feep> this robs the theory of all motivating force
[23:42:09] <Betawolf> I am happy to report that the worldview described was totally alien to me. 
[23:42:33] <feep> Betawolf: I can instantiate the worldview in my head, luckily it does not breach containment
[23:42:46] <feep> but for safety reasons, I need to engineer an escape/recoherence path from inside it.
[23:43:05] <feep> this may have some general use.
[23:45:18] <feep> however, like the joke about the mathematician who says "a solution is possible" and then goes back to sleep, I, well, yes.
[23:45:47] <two2thehead> lol
[23:48:12] <two2thehead> 'There were two men trying to decide what to do for a living. They went to see a counselor, and he decided that they had good problem solving skills.
[23:48:13] <two2thehead> 'He tried a test to narrow the area of specialty. He put each man in a room with a stove, a bucket of water, and an empty pot on the stove. He said, “Boil some water in the pot.” Both men filled the pot with water from the bucket and turned on the burner to boil the water.
[23:48:13] <two2thehead> 'Next, he put them into a room with a stove, a bucket of water, and a pot full of water on the stove. Again, he said, “Boil the water in the pot.” The first man immediately turned on the burner. The counselor told him to be an Engineer. The second man emptied the pot and proudly said that now the problem is reduced to the previously solved problem. The counselor told him to be a mathematician.'
