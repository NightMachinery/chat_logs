[07:47:38] <exodrifter> hostname resolution suddenly stopped working on my computer. I use NetworkManager and systemd-resolved. I tried changing /etc/systemd/resolved.conf to use 8.8.8.8 as the DNS server, but /etc/resolve.conf lists the nameserver as 127.0.0.53 which doesn't make any sense to me. I'm not sure what's wrong or what to do? I can ping 8.8.8.8 and my router but I can't reach google.com, though other devices on my network can.

I read the article my VPN provider gives on the topic, but it's not clear to me what they're talking about.
[09:02:24] <grawity> 1) you're not the first one with it being the problem
[09:02:47] <grawity> 2) it doesn't cause all other network interfaces to stop working, it causes *DNS* to stop working because it is set as the preferred interface for all DNS queries

[09:04:25] <grawity> for regular IP packet routing, IPv4 and IPv6 have separate routing tables, so the VPN app wants to avoid the situation where e.g. vpn0 is default for IPv4, but eth0 remains default for IPv6
[09:04:48] <grawity> they could solve this the easiest by just setting up IPv6 (even dummy IPv6, not necessarily full working IPv6) on their VPN
[09:04:49] *** Quits: jpic (~jpic@82.142.20.182) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:05:01] <grawity> but instead they create a separate interface that becomes the default for IPv6
[09:05:05] <grawity> a bit weird but ok
[09:05:29] <grawity> but then they *also* think that DNS in systemd-resolved has separate "defaults" for v4 and v6 (which doesn't make sense)
[09:05:51] <grawity> so they set this dummy interface as the "default route" for DNS (maybe that particular terminology is what causes the confusion)
[09:06:25] *** Joins: jpic (~jpic@82.142.20.182)
[09:06:27] <grawity> so when your real VPN interface is gone, this dummy "catch IPv6" interface remains the only interface with the "DNS default route" flag in systemd-resolved

[11:10:51] <mpan> Oh, ayekat was quickier.
[11:11:01] <ayekat> it doesn't look like the i915 module exposes any parameter that would allow it to set that value upon loading (e.g. with modprobe.d) :-/

[11:51:15] <mpan> Things like gitlab and flyspray, to name two major packages, depend on PostgreSQL. So it would not be responsible to even consider rolling out 14 as just another version bump.

[12:28:55] <rcf> Gagis: you're probably going to be fine with whatever, because you have been managing them manually and just find it tedious. The reason that recommendations of helpers is often frowned upon here is that new users aren't trying to automate something that is tedious, but rather something they don't understand. 
[12:29:12] <Gagis> thats fair
[12:29:13] <Khorne> Sid127, tried a different port? That might indicate not enough power delivery
[12:30:12] <Sid127> I've tried all the ports my PC has, as well as multiple different laptops
[12:30:19] <ayekat> [czar]: it's just how things are: the more components/abstraction layers you add to something, the more complex it becomes, and thus more likely to stumble somewhere
[12:32:09] <mpan> [czar]: nearly all AUR helpers are also removing the conceptual barrier between AUR and proper repositories, which makes the user think about the situation in a different manner. That may be by itself bringing trouble, in particular if coupled with some helpers not requiring you to manually review sources before they are used.

[13:38:44] <bug2000> To dual boot with Windows it is recommended to configure Windows to use UTC, rather than Linux to use localtime. (Windows by default uses localtime [1].) 
[13:38:52] <bug2000> Oh! That is a new one. It used to be suggested the other way around.
[13:39:04] <grawity> because that Windows option used to be broken
[13:39:25] <grawity> I think it existed since Win2000, but broke sometime later and only got fixed in Win10

[14:24:34] <grawity> tbh on this laptop here I suspect I'm having a hardware issue, like the actual Wi-Fi antenna wires going bad, since it reports a way too low RSSI
[14:25:22] <bug2000> Sounds possible.
[14:25:47] <mohan43u> What is RSSI? Is this the value I should check?
[14:26:12] <Tom^> grawity: i wonder if one can HW mod the transmit power :p
[14:26:19] <grawity> I was investigating occassional dropouts that I'm having despite being literally 2m away from the AP, found about `iw event -r` which shows me when the kernel thinks "RSSI too low, time to rescan"
[14:26:22] <bug2000> I know that most devices have good reception at some spot in my home, except for this one guy device who fails to use the network. I tell him his device is problematic and he just responds, it works at that other place. The problem must be in your house.
[14:26:24] <grawity> Tom^: the laptop's or the AP's?
[14:26:24] * bug2000 shrugs
[14:26:29] <Tom^> grawity: both
[14:26:48] <Tom^> grawity: would be cool in a really crowded area, just outpower everyone. one wifi to rule them all :D
[14:27:15] <bug2000> Tom^, I don't know physics. But would a really big antenna help?
[14:27:24] <grawity> Tom^: probably, I guess high-gain antenna or something like that? or in a crowded area you could get one of those PtP bridges that are semi-directional (use something like a patch antenna)
[14:27:36] <Tom^> grawity: yeah
[14:27:43] * bug2000 once built a cantenna never to be used.
[14:27:51] <grawity> there are even a few where you're supposed to connect your own antenna over coax

[21:29:00] <mpan> mattf: → #videolan
[21:29:18] <mpan> Most likely because VLC is simply not supporting that. But they will be able to explain that much better.

[21:29:55] <mattf> no it is much older
[21:30:10] <greenhamster> mattf: that specific m3u fails because some URLs inside generate are 403 http errors
[21:30:18] <mattf> oh
[21:30:26] <greenhamster> starting vlc from a console prints them
[21:30:39] <mattf> can't vlc ignore those?

[21:32:42] <mpan> … though for me none of the first dozen URLs work.
[21:32:43] <mattf> yeah i thought so
[21:33:39] <greenhamster> I just verified with a random radio station from https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Internetradio/Stationen/#Radiosender-Kanada that I can download the m3u and play in VLC - the issue is this specific m3u and the data/server it points to, not vlc.

[23:13:46] <jkc> If XMP was enabled by default, and the DIMMs in the system weren't capable of running with an XMP profile, you wouldn't be able to get into UEFI/BIOS to disable XMP. That's why its disabled by default, and you have to turn it on if you're running XMP-capable modules.
