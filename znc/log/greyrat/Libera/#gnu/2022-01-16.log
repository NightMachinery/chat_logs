[10:10:21] <robin> Ribby, what issue are you seeing? with respect to bios/uefi specifically, gnu/linux distros should ordinarily 'just work' if secure boot is off
[10:10:52] <Ribby> I typed it on guix, but I could relay.
[10:11:05] <robin> oh, i'm in #guix too, nm
[10:11:51] <Ribby> Should I relay on this channel?
[10:17:10] *** Joins: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps)
[10:17:32] <robin> Ribby, if it's a guix issue, #guix is better. i looked at the screenshots and concur with the people saying the problem probably isn't uefi-related, if the 'cannot open shared object file' message is the problem you're currently facing
[10:18:14] <Ribby> I was suspecting it too at first assumption. Miscompiled OS?
[10:19:21] <robin> probably not as they're the same disk images everyone else uses to install guix, but perhaps the filesystem is corrupted somehow?
[10:20:05] <Ribby> It's possible. Nevertheless, the usb I have failed in result.
[10:20:18] <robin> (i'm assuming you downloaded one of the ISO files from the official website)
[10:20:27] <Ribby> Oh no.
[10:20:37] <Ribby> I got it from a online store.
[10:20:51] <Ribby> So maybe they didn't know what they are doing?

[11:33:37] <jason1236> no idea, maybe pkgsrc will help you?  the magic command to compile i.e. to build a new netbsd kernel:  mconfig autobuild 9.1 amd64      <-- all is then done like magic: source:    "https://gitlab.com/openbsd98324/mconfig/-/raw/master/src/mconfig.c"  
[11:35:08] <bugweiser> pkgsrc? whats that?
[11:37:15] *** Joins: freep (~freepppp@62.1.174.38.dsl.dyn.forthnet.gr)
[11:38:19] <jason1236> pkgsrc is a BSD method to make from source a package. 
[11:38:58] <bugweiser> you give it a tar file with source and it does all the rest?
[11:39:02] <jason1236> It shows well how much innovative is BSD, compared to Linux. Still at X11R7. No wayland, never ever moving to Wayland ever.
[11:39:34] <jason1236> bugweiser: I just do :   mconfig  pkgbuild www/dillo  editors/vim  editors/emacs  
[11:40:05] <jason1236> it does all into a single command line, it builds. It is working on BSD over many many years. 
[11:40:05] <bugweiser> wait, you are that person writing fltk apps right?
[11:40:14] <jason1236> one of them.

[11:42:21] <jason1236> i moved from linux to netbsd on my desktop ... it was too slow Linux. I see that netbsd is quite superior in many ways, but have lack of dev's (persons) for making drivers, like GPU.
[11:42:55] <bugweiser> yeah, I do agree with jrmu theres some interesting parts to bsd
[11:43:33] <bugweiser> including some userland, which is why minix went with bsd userland
[11:44:11] <bugweiser> I don't think there is a bsd machine on onworks.net ...
[11:44:13] <jason1236> the superiority of BSD is that the installation is done from source 
[11:44:29] <jason1236> basically all BSD universe is built directly from source. 
[11:44:34] <bugweiser> yuk..
[11:44:44] <bugweiser> surely they have install isos ?
[11:45:09] <jason1236>  mconfig autobuild 9.1 amd64  <-- example would never work easily on linux, like a just a command. it is x1000 times more cumbersome on linux
[11:45:20] <jason1236> sure
[11:45:41] <jason1236>  "https://gitlab.com/openbsd98324/netbsd-live/-/raw/master/live/9.1/amd64/v5/netbsd-live-image-2000mb-v5.img.gz"   <-- you can run that to test, with startx
[11:46:09] <jason1236> this is a memstick live with grub and X11 preintalled - just for testing, but it helps to fix PCs.
[11:46:35] <bugweiser> wow.. 2000 mb ???
[11:46:37] <bugweiser> wow
[11:47:26] <bugweiser> not my cup of tea... how long does it take before you know what each and every single file is and does?
[11:47:40] <jason1236> it has grub + netbsd (all stuffs) + slackware amd64 (running on ramdisk). ultimate swiss technology
[11:47:42] <bugweiser> tinycore linux at 12mb is already taking me over a year...
[11:48:05] <jason1236> tinycore? 12 mb??
[11:48:17] <bugweiser> ok, 16 with desktop.
[11:48:38] <jason1236> bugweiser: ah, how long. no idea, i use linux and bsd for 30 years maybe now or more. no idea
[11:48:55] <bugweiser> ok, a little over 20 mb when humans can use it, couse you need approx 4.8 mb for midnight commander.
[11:50:07] <bugweiser> thats quite some time
[11:50:42] <bugweiser> I wasted 2/3 of that on windows
[11:51:13] <jason1236> windows is bad... it changes. BSD stays and remains same. so you might learn.
[11:51:29] <jason1236> learning linux is too a waste.
[11:51:41] <bugweiser> up to win8 windows didn't change (or you used the wrong methods/interfaces...)
[11:51:51] <jason1236> it becomes powerful when the technology can be compiled from source - any time on any Arch. 
[11:52:11] <jason1236> then,... BSD comes in play. So long you can compile it from source you are save.
[11:52:15] <jason1236> safe.
[11:52:40] <bugweiser> yeah.. just that compiling basically almost never works
[11:52:55] <bugweiser> and that users shouldn need a full blown developer machine burdoned with 40 years of crap
[11:53:00] <jason1236> take an example ... DAVEPANEL
[11:53:21] <jason1236> you can work on the same application for 50 years, and it will always work and compile with any C compiler.
[11:53:23] <bugweiser> and more importantly that users shouldn't need to know 4 decades worth of compilers, libraries, headers and basically every possible library.

[11:53:43] <bugweiser> and even MORE importantly, that NORMAL USERS shouldn't need to do what developers already find hard: debugging
[11:53:54] <bugweiser> and even MORE important than that...
[11:54:00] <jason1236> https://gitlab.com/openbsd98324/davepanel   <-- try this super code !
[11:54:17] <bugweiser> that users shouldn't need to fulli digest a source code AND DEBUG it from someone else.
[11:54:46] <jason1236> davepanel is really a nice example that you can learn over 50 years and compile still your code on any planet / OS ... so that, it shows that learning is possible. On windows, forget.
[11:55:05] <bugweiser> I call that javascript.
[11:55:18] <bugweiser> what I coded 23 years ago, works today. ZERO maintenence
[11:55:24] <bugweiser> ANY platform
[11:55:28] <bugweiser> oh, and it got gui
[11:55:40] <jason1236> zero maintenance is my good goal of programming
[11:55:46] <bugweiser> <insert powerpoint 97 drums here>
[11:55:54] <jason1236> since I know that I can do it alone, I make sure that it work.
[11:56:11] <jason1236> like MAKE, that one broke all the time. I coded "GIRMAKE" to make it work.
[11:56:18] <bugweiser> here, shar-utils: no mortal can compile that ...

[11:56:27] <bugweiser> call it a 'challenge'
[11:56:29] <bugweiser> lol
[11:57:15] <bugweiser> no mortal can even read it. you got some weird code that modifies source code, which then modifies other source code etc.. One doesn't even have a clue what is sent to the compiler.
[11:57:40] <bugweiser> actually happens in that sharutils above also.
[11:57:47] <jason1236> well
[11:57:51] <jason1236> try to compile latex
[11:57:59] <jason1236> pdflatex and so on. this is too quite hell
[11:58:12] <jason1236> mumble is too terrible source code
[11:58:17] <bugweiser> but it was so simple :)  (kidding, slightly)
[11:58:39] <jason1236> try with pkgsrc !
[11:58:44] <jason1236> pkgsrc might work on linux
[11:59:00] <jason1236> i prepared a cross thing on debian to use pkgsrc
[11:59:29] <bugweiser> ok,which linux do I pick on onworks.net ?
[11:59:30] <jason1236> mostly I use pkgsrc on raspberry pi on my desktop (netbsd), but I think that maybe this share gnu utils could be in.
[11:59:44] <jason1236> solene on openbsd does that kind of job . to make pkgs.
[12:00:01] <jason1236> onworks.net?
[12:00:05] <bugweiser> yeah
[12:00:11] <jason1236> what is onworks?
[12:00:25] <bugweiser> free virtual desktop, NO registration
[12:00:40] <bugweiser> they provision you with a machine in 25 sec
[12:00:45] <bugweiser> then load the os of choice
[12:00:54] <jason1236> wow
[12:00:55] <bugweiser> and you get vnc in the browser. 1 minute tops
[12:01:01] <bugweiser> password is 123456 for user and root

[12:05:26] <jason1236> it is a clone of linux
[12:06:03] <bugweiser> no? did sortix fix the braindead memory design of linux ? In linux they think that this works:  a+b=c, therefor c must fit into a
[12:06:03] <Ribby> No, I barely touched the Linux brands.
[12:06:10] <bugweiser> (hence no hibernation possibility)
[12:06:59] <AIM[m]> bugweiser: bugweiser:  Explain pls
[12:07:06] <AIM[m]> I'm learning Linux, so
[12:07:23] <AIM[m]> How does the thing you described work?
[12:07:24] <bugweiser> yeah, they should warn new unixlike users with this one on the get go
[12:07:30] <bugweiser> forget about hibernation.
[12:07:42] <AIM[m]> Like can you give me explanation for the memory bug
[12:07:57] <bugweiser> there is just one sane solution (so microsoft uses that, and therefore ther exist no alternative couse linux don't want to do anything like windows does, sigh)
[12:08:02] <bugweiser> ok
[12:08:06] <bugweiser> total system ram=
[12:08:13] <bugweiser> virtual + physical, right?
[12:08:20] <AIM[m]> Yep
[12:08:47] <bugweiser> now, if you want to hybernate.. you gotta store your physical somewhere, (windows creates a hibernate file, the size of your ram, doh)
[12:08:58] <AIM[m]> By virtual you mean the swap or the virtual memory access?
[12:09:10] <bugweiser> yes, total swap space
[12:09:14] <AIM[m]> s/access/addressing/
[12:09:21] <AIM[m]> Oh okay
[12:09:31] <AIM[m]> And what does Linux do?
[12:09:36] <bugweiser> so  total_swap_space + physical_ram = total_system memory
[12:09:38] <AIM[m]> For hibernation
[12:09:53] <AIM[m]> bugweiser: Okay
[12:10:00] <bugweiser> yeah, if you want to hibernate, then total_system_memory must fit into total_swap_space
[12:10:12] <bugweiser> bada kshhh  (poor drumsound)
[12:10:29] <jason1236> back
[12:10:45] <bugweiser> literally this: a + b = c, so then c must fit into a  (where a = swap, b=physical, and c=total).
[12:11:01] <bugweiser> that is why you can't hibernate in linux
[12:11:01] <jason1236> bugweiser: no idea, he did stdio.h and all base from bare hand.
[12:11:11] <bugweiser> broken memory design from the get go.
[12:11:20] <jason1236> anyhow, it is sys V. I need a V5 BSD ! 
[12:11:25] <jason1236> i need a bsd tech, not linux
[12:12:00] <bugweiser> oh, so you think, Oh, i'll be clever. I'll reserve a hibernate file (size of ram), and make some script that does a swapon that hibernate-file JUST before hibernating. Problem solved.. right?
[12:12:03] <bugweiser> NOPE
[12:12:30] <bugweiser> couse then there is more than 1 swap location and... "i'm sorry hal, but I can't let you do that"
[12:13:13] <bugweiser> so, we can fix drivers all day long to support hibernation.. but the required memory design to start with is broken.
[12:13:24] <bugweiser> so, suppose you are in the train (or whatever)
[12:13:33] <bugweiser> and your computer says it's low on battary, like 15 minutes left
[12:14:06] <bugweiser> good luck with that race against the clock, trying to complete enough stuff that is open so your swap-usage is low enough that physical can fit into it..
[12:14:34] <bugweiser> and HOPE no system maintenene program automatically starts... just as you hibernate.. couse one byte to less, and everything is gone
[12:14:43] <bugweiser> see ? braindead
[12:14:58] <bugweiser> forget about ever geting a normal laptop.
[12:15:41] * jason1236 jason looks at PINE64 notebook arm, thin and 80 euros only
[12:15:52] <bugweiser> Oh, and here is the equally braindead kicker: solutions are offered as: 'remove ram from your computer and sell on ebay'...
[12:16:32] <bugweiser> ok, deal, I shouldve said: forget about getting a laptop working normally on linux
[12:16:51] <bugweiser> where as long as you have 5 minutes of power, you are GUARANTEED you can do a hibernate

[13:06:40] <bugweiser> also, I think this particular version strips trailing padding '=' if the filename is base64 encoded.. (but the base64 example, not mentioned in the bug-rapport, has '=' padding ...)

[15:18:54] <jason1236> ah yeah. proc is not available for security, it runs on VM machine-
[15:19:02] <jason1236> anyhow 
[15:19:07] <jason1236> you shall not need /proc
[15:19:18] <jason1236> to compile, the source code must be written to be clean.
[15:19:43] <bugweiser> lol, this is gnu code
[15:19:47] <jason1236> if it needs /proc, the source code needs improvements.
[15:19:55] <jason1236> sure, /proc is gnu.
[15:20:47] <jason1236> for instance, on bsd, we can compile and run things without having need of root
[15:21:05] <jason1236> the cross compilation of kernel on bsd can be done over a regualr user (so no root at all).
[15:21:40] <bugweiser> ok, so we can't compile sharutils ?
[15:21:56] <jason1236> it is  a very bad habit to use root for anything.
[15:22:25] <jason1236> good question.
[15:22:30] <bugweiser> and we can't even just compile uuencode.c (couse all kind of magic scripts must first change the sourcecode and add/copy all kind of files)?
[15:23:09] <jason1236> is sharutils into pkgsrc?
[15:23:26] <bugweiser> i'm suspecting some libopts must write the code to parse the options..
[15:23:29] <jason1236> ah yeah
[15:23:32] <jason1236> it is called: 
[15:23:35] <jason1236> gsharutils
[15:23:42] <jason1236> so it seems that freebsd has it.
[15:23:55] <bugweiser> but then I get the wrong version I think, no?
[15:24:06] <jason1236> yeah so bsd can compile it on the fly with pkgsrc
[15:24:30] <bugweiser> the wrong version isn't gonna exibit the behaviour we are after
[15:24:34] <jason1236> mconfig pkgbuild archivers/gsharutils 
[15:24:41] <jason1236> mconfig pkgbuild archivers/gsharutils    <--- that might work maybe on linux
[15:24:58] <bugweiser> but why would I build the wrong version?
[15:25:05] <jason1236> ah 
[15:25:21] <jason1236> it shows here serveral version. no clue.
[15:25:49] <bugweiser> lol, I don't even have a clue what version this specific tar-ball is ...
[15:26:11] <bugweiser> as you said, autocrap etc..
[15:26:34] <bugweiser> but.. after compiling it, one can run it and query the version that the compiler gave it :)
[15:27:05] <jason1236> with --version
[15:27:15] <jason1236> or less -f and digg digg.
[15:27:19] <bugweiser> yes, and -v 
[15:28:44] <bugweiser> so, how would I solve this 'bootstrap failure: early death'
[15:28:50] <bugweiser> not much clues there..

[15:34:07] <bugweiser> oh, I misunderstood, I thought you wanted to whip up a bsd machine to try and compile sharutils
[15:35:08] <bugweiser> how will X help compile gnu sharutils ?
[15:35:08] <jason1236> maybe it is possible. i have to think how.
[15:35:26] <jason1236> you dont need x for x gnu sharutils  
[15:36:18] <bugweiser> then lets not waste the time to install x :)

[15:38:12] <jason1236> i forgot what is postinstall
[15:38:43] <Ribby> Yes, those instructions were very very clear. At least I got this far by my reading skils.
[15:46:12] <bugweiser> i tried autoreconf and got a bunch of errors, the last ones suggest to try: 'automake --add-missing'

[16:41:27] <jason1236> currently I run 3 to 4 VM machines. 
[16:42:16] <bugweiser> jrmu was kind enough to provision me with 2 boxes, 3gb bsd and 1gb debian (the bsd is really as remote desktop as I clearly need it... lol)
[16:42:19] <jason1236> i have managed to get qemu -curses on a netbsd disk, then, I install irssi from source, and i can hold a stable machine that stays connected on irc.
[16:42:38] <jason1236> a desktop
[16:42:40] <jason1236> wow
[16:42:52] <jason1236> long time i havent been using a remote desktop

[16:43:59] <jason1236> i need to modifiy sortix or change netbsd kernel to get it to work on i486
[16:44:00] <bugweiser> and the 1gb debian box is for tinkering (and writing tuts thereof)

[16:49:37] <jason1236> 9 or bsd, anyhow it is closer Unix
[16:49:42] <jason1236> so long it is not linux
[16:50:06] <jason1236> bsd and 9 are quite compatible 
[16:50:21] <jason1236> since both are descendants of BSD/UNIX / Vx family.
[16:50:29] <jason1236> it is "bsd"
[16:55:35] <bugweiser> there certainly are some things that i like better in bsd world (well, after looking behind the curtains and under the hood).
[16:55:55] <bugweiser> it's clearly more 'true' (though I usually hate such words) to unix
[16:56:00] <bugweiser> and things like 'a spec'
[16:58:24] <bugweiser> lol, still can't get mc to work properly 
[16:58:43] <bugweiser> but perhaps not just its fault, I couldn't use arrow keys etc anyway.
[16:59:12] <bugweiser> I have that on some other shellaccounts also, no clue why
[16:59:42] <bugweiser> also, I wouldn't know what to do to get gnu sharutils to compile
[17:01:58] <bugweiser> also i'm awake now for almost 36 hours :(
[17:02:43] <bugweiser> its 14:30 locally ..
[17:03:59] <bugweiser> I fear I have to abort. As always, compiling is next to impossible (but perhaps.. I only tried to compile stuff that was interesting and I didn't find any other solution to obtain information otherwise, so probably i have only tried to compile crap software up to now...
[17:04:56] <jason1236> eternal_valley (sanctum) is really a very beautiful map on Sauerbraten/cube2 !!
[17:04:58] <jason1236> who wants to play sauerbraten/cube2?
[17:05:02] <bugweiser> if gnu would just provide binaries, then now 24 hours woud have been saved...
[17:05:23] <bugweiser> well.. if gnu would document their obscure non-standard fileformats... a week nay a month would have been saved...
[17:05:42] <jason1236> maybe a virtualmachine would be ok with netbsd - you need 20 gb to comnpiel with pkgsrc.
[17:05:50] <bugweiser> kill the vm jason1236  and know I thank you very very much !!
[17:06:15] <jason1236> w3e can install qemu -curses and run netbsd on VM on ircnow
[17:06:23] <jason1236> but we need qemu -curses.
[17:06:24] <bugweiser> can you run it through this magich pkgsrc ?
[17:06:36] <jason1236> or maybe 
[17:06:40] <jason1236> ask thunix
[17:06:55] <jason1236> visit thunix and ask maybe for a vm... i dont know if you can get one.
[17:07:10] <jason1236> but iof you have one, then you can run my vdisk.img  over qemu to run netbsd on it.
[17:07:36] <bugweiser> if I understand you, there is some magic tool, called pkgsrc, which will do what we fail to do
[17:07:55] <jason1236> pkgsrc is automatic package maanger on bsd
[17:07:59] <bugweiser> and you give it a tar-ball, and it compiles it for you (which we fail to do)

[17:09:43] <jason1236> and it is done.
[17:09:59] <jason1236> pkgsrc does very everything
[17:10:06] <bugweiser> I don't understand..
[17:10:09] <Ribby> ok.
[17:10:27] <bugweiser> mconfig pkgbuild archivers/gsharutils   <<< where do we tell it what source-code to compile?
[17:10:30] <jason1236> the best is that I show you once
[17:10:40] <jason1236> pkgsrc will fetch it
[17:10:56] <bugweiser> but how do we know it is our version
[17:10:59] <jason1236> pkgsrc will get the code tarball, will prepare the libs,... until it is done.
[17:11:07] <bugweiser> how do we know it is not a version later or sooner ?
[17:11:14] <jason1236> it is a big project. all BSD*s are working on it.
[17:11:28] <jason1236>  oh... good question
[17:11:34] <jason1236>  /join -libera #pkgsrc
[17:11:44] <jason1236>   best is to ask the PROs  #pkgsrc
[17:11:48] <bugweiser> yea we want specifically the version that i linke dto
[17:11:58] <jason1236>  i dont know concerning versions
[17:12:53] <jason1236> bugweiser: or ask directly at #netbsd

[18:03:00] <epony> one way of thinkging is to assume there is only Linux..
[18:03:54] <epony> the more competent way is to know there is Unix-derived systems which are more technically consistent than the Linux downstream plays
[18:04:14] <bugweiser> true
[18:05:20] <epony> Linux distributions seem to argue about their own doings between each other about the packaging tool and format, and the desktop environment and set of applications pre-packaged
[18:07:04] <epony> while in reality the idea about the ports tree (prepared source compiled tooling) from which to create packages comes from the Unix-derived systems, and only some Linux distributions use it, it's gaining popularity and traction instead of "packaging models"
[18:08:06] <epony> in that note, a porting application system is the generator for packages and package installers / managers are just the consumer frontend for the end users
[18:08:13] <Ribby> Got a question, what is the best desktop interface environment/design?
[18:08:54] <bugweiser> i agree epony
[18:08:55] <epony> you have two choices, one that someone else chooses for you, and one that you choose for yourself
[18:09:16] <epony> Ribby, so, which choice is more like the one you need ;-) ^
