[02:35:15] <tib> mjgardner Nice post! I think you posted twice the Raku snippet whereas you wanted to post a pure Perl 5 version in the « Perl feed finder » part + there is 2 words without space « typesused »
[02:35:24] <holyghost_> anyway, hacking perl5 for third Ph.D. Will work more on AI-NLP later on.
[02:35:57] <tib> But this is a great post with a lot of interesting links as usual (you know I’m a fan)
[02:43:03] <mjgardner> Thanks tib. The hazards of crossposting to another CMS…
