[09:31:49] <epony> so UNIX history follows Bourne Shell and then it gets replaced with Korn Shell as standard implementations
[09:32:27] <epony> the Bash is another shell that is neither, and is late to these and has incompatible changes which are portability problems
[09:33:32] <epony> also you can't confirm zsh is a better alternative as "blanket" statement, you have to compare and evaluate, it's not included in Unix descendant systems and is too new to be considered stable and standard
[09:34:19] <epony> new does not mean reliable or standard or "better" whatever that inconclusive superlative that might mean for you
[09:36:30] <epony> also see

[09:38:22] <epony> ^ the standard covers aspects of Bourne and Korn shells, and some problems with System V shell
[09:38:44] <epony> "is better" means nothing
[09:39:34] <epony> and "many versions" does not provide an argument in that support (and is also incorrect)

[14:12:40] <epony> M3RELATIVISM[m], I'm a programmer.. for 40 years and know UNIX and it's historic details including shells.
[14:13:03] <epony> I've read the pages before linking and reviewed them at the time of linking as well.
[14:13:39] <epony> you might stop advertising zsh as better and suitable for scripting, same applies to bash
[14:13:57] <labrador> bash = scriptable epony 
[14:14:02] <labrador> zsh isn't tho
[14:14:13] <labrador> bash is the defacto linux shell
[14:14:23] <epony> no, that is the GNU shell
[14:14:33] <epony> Linux is a kernel
[14:14:36] <labrador> >defacto
[14:14:50] <labrador> everyone uses bash
[14:14:57] <epony> nope, just you.
[14:15:17] <epony> check the POSIX standard again
[14:15:32] <labrador> epony, stop being out of touch and look at the fact that most linux installs use bash
[14:15:44] <labrador> sh is a pita to script
[14:15:53] * epony yawns..
[14:16:37] <epony> portable scripts are in Shell which is Sh, a mode of the shells that is portable, and also most shells have a POSIX mode too, but Sh is a subset
[14:16:53] <epony> nobody is scripting in bash ;-)
[14:17:04] <epony> it's the sh mode 
[14:17:30] <labrador> epony, if you used arrays(which everyone does cuz the alt to it in sh is hard af) you're using bash
[14:17:33] <labrador> so no
[14:17:37] <epony> and moreover, scripts are Korn shell
[14:17:55] <labrador> i dunno what korn shell is
[14:18:13] <epony> that's quite ignorant as usual ;-)
[14:18:44] <epony> read backlog, there are links
[14:18:51] <labrador> imo bash >> sh just because it has arrays
[14:18:57] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell#Features
[14:19:00] <labrador> theyre so useful
[14:20:41] <epony> http://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1#POSIX_mode ; http://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1#Strict_Bourne_shell_mode
[14:20:59] <epony> don't know why you think arrays are not available in sh mode
[14:21:22] <labrador> cuz sh doesn't have easy to use arrays?
[14:21:29] <epony> maybe your favourite shell is incorrectly operating in sh mode too, other than in posix and bash mode
[14:21:36] <epony> that's nonsense ;-)
[14:23:16] <labrador> object-oriented-programming (since ksh93t) 
[14:23:19] <labrador> ksh is cool
[14:24:19] <epony> yeah, it's not the default though, optional package
[14:24:30] <epony> because the extra features are not portable
[14:24:41] <labrador> oh
[14:24:45] <epony> and it's not validated for robustness and programming style
[14:26:04] <epony> "The functionality of the original KornShell, ksh88, was used as a basis for the standard POSIX.2, Shell and Utilities, Command Interpreter (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992.) Some vendors still ship their own versions of the older ksh88 variant, sometimes with extensions."
[14:26:12] <epony> typically public domain korn shell (pdksh)

[20:02:59] <isf> and nonfree software
[20:03:13] <isf> the only way to have free software is license your software as a free software.
[20:03:30] <isf> that mean put a free software license in your software.

[20:04:03] <isf> the only way for have free software, is put the software under a free software license.
[20:04:58] <isf> becouse you need have the 4 freedoms, if you have it weak or only 3 or only 2 or only 1 that mean that software is propietary software and nonfree software so that mean dont respect the users freedom of you as a individual and your community if you participate on the sociaty

[20:07:38] <isf> the only way to make your software as free software is license it with a free software license as GPLv3 or later.
