[06:22:31] <ayecee> craigevil: the origin of the problem is that the default keyserver was very recently shut down.
[06:22:55] <craigevil> dpkg doesn't check keys of a local package, or you can feed apt the untrusted command
[06:22:57] <quartz> Do you guys think I can just proced to step 6? Or am I good?
[06:23:20] <Dagmar> Sure... What's the worst that could possibly happen that doesn't happen pretty regularly on Arch
[06:23:53] <ayecee> quartz: as long as the keys that are used to sign the packages you want to install and update, are installed, then you're good.
[06:23:57] <quartz> pamac is really nice though. Is there nothing equivalent for apt?
[06:24:01] <craigevil> i played with manjaro for a couple of weeks on my pi400 until a kde/gpg key updated gave me a blank desktop
[06:24:13] <ayecee> quartz: really the only way to find out is to update a package and see if it fails with a key error.
[06:24:29] <Dagmar> quartz: No, it only has dpkg source packages made by sane people

[10:27:59] <[a]> Good day to all - I hope that you're doing all great. I need some help on something...
[10:28:00] <[a]> That is, if anyone in here is familiar with VMware vSphere Web Client.
[10:28:00] <[a]> [Scenario]
[10:28:01] <[a]> I can't seem to find this...  " Configure IP Settings from the vSphere Web Client"  https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.esxi.install.doc/GUID-8C70FB9B-D2AB-424E-BBBD-B77AC33C6EF8.html     at my dashboard,   https://pasteboard.co/K7TqUeI.png .
[10:28:01] <[a]> I've checked and saw that I have vSphere Client version 6.7.0.48000... but then again I cant seem to find "Virtual adapters." at https://pasteboard.co/K7TqUeI.png .
[10:28:02] <[a]> Can someone please tell me if I have missed something obvious... (scratches his/her head).
[10:28:02] <[a]> I'm new to VMware vSphere client adminstration and my objective is to assign a static IP and (its DNS entries later on) to my newly-created VM named 'elastic4.<redactedDomainName.blahBlah>' . I haven't found the appropriate documentation for that at www.mware.com ...so can any of you, um, give me some tips on how to configure an IP address for a VM
[10:28:03] <[a]> from the vSphere Web Client this, please? Thanks in advance.

[12:29:03] <autopsy> What kernel was GNU software written on?

[12:30:35] <autopsy> Unix. Ok... GNU means Generally Not Unix though.
[12:30:56] <autopsy> Maybe it was Unix.
[12:31:23] <autopsy> Got me. I'm unsure of where GNU software bundle originated.
[12:31:58] <Sauvin> I don't know the details. I think Stallman wrote a pile of stuff against his Hurd, but Hurd didn't develop quickly enough, so when Torvalds released the kernel, Stallman grabbed it and adapted all his stuff to the Linux kernel.

[14:24:03] <autopsy> bewees, yes thats a good plan. Thats exactly what I would do but you want to keep a private copy of the package hashes and the keys seperate from the outside world. You want nobody to be able to infiltrate that server and protect that repository metadata with anything something simple like another sha512sum and another package manifecst.
[14:24:05] <bewees> this attack would require access to root and access to the private key; but double checking the hashes from another mirror will make this attack harder, as the attacker would need to control all those systems and make sure only my host gets the modified package. as a wide package attack would immediately be noticable by the community, this attack works only individually

[15:58:39] <PlanckLort> Hello! I have a driver with a GPIO triggered interrupt which schedules a workqueue task (in a workqueue created with the flag WQ_HIGHPRI) in the workfunction a SPI message is called. This happens at a frequency of 2 kHz. My issue is that when measuring the time between the IRQ and when SPI transfer has finished I sometimes get a time of 2 or more milliseconds which is to slow for 2 kHz. I need some
[15:58:41] <PlanckLort> ideas on how to decrease the time between the IRQ and for the workqueue function to start executing, any help is appreciated! :)

The only diference comes with BBU Raid, which isn't much of an actual improvement, but reliability factor improvement, slightly. Bigger thing is, portability, you can always access the mdadm RAID on any Linux system, where-as with the HW Raid, you have to have the same manufacturer's brand, sometimes even the exact same model or line of models.

[22:16:08] <SpeakerTomeat> CoolerX, I would personally try a different resolution first. it's a displacement of every other line so it looks like a sync issue. maybe hardware failure, but by changing sync speed with a different resolution I'd check to see if it changes first

[22:19:32] <SpeakerTomeat> CoolerX, but... sincerely, if this is a sync issue, the interlaced draw is most probably a protocol between lcd and gpu, so I'd suspect hardware issue.

[23:20:05] <TheFreim> I've never had *much* issue with PA, only a couple times over the last ~year I've been full time linux.
[23:20:09] <Kyv> So does ALSA.
[23:20:18] * Khaytsus rolls eyes
[23:20:38] <Khaytsus> Then you gotta add mixers and fix every modern app to somehow twork with alsa again directly.
[23:20:40] <TheFreim> I must say that ALSA works just as well once you configure it properly to have multiple audio playing at once
[23:20:44] <Khaytsus> So silly.
[23:21:00] <Khaytsus> PA just works and no configuration needed for mixing ;)
[23:21:02] * Khaytsus shrugs
[23:21:04] <johnnyapol> PA usually worked fine for me, but I switched to pipewire and have been pretty happy with it. There's the occasional hiccup
[23:21:04] <clarity> ALSA used to work just fine, then PA came and messed everything up
[23:21:05] <Kyv> Maybe you have a dated experience with it too.
[23:21:05] <TheFreim> but PA works fine as well
[23:21:18] <TheFreim> I really don't care either way, both work fine and since I am used to pulse i stick with pulse.
[23:21:26] <akik> i think it's this line in default.pa "load-module module-suspend-on-idle" so disable that by commenting it out
[23:21:34] <Revelator> Khaytsus: And overall there is a tad difference between high speed and the so called "category 1" hdmi cables, mostly when it comes to 4k and hz though from what I've experienced.

[23:57:58] <Psi-Jack> 301 may or may not be correct, actually. 301 is intended for absolutely permanent relocation.
[23:58:06] <c705> if you want https to work, then you need a signed cert for that domain
[23:58:08] <droptone> I literaally want users, viaa either http or https, when accessing domaina.com, to auto-forward to domainb.com
[23:58:18] *** Quits: rigid (~rigid@user/rigid) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:58:27] <Psi-Jack> droptone: The certificate has to be valid for /both/ domains to forward https to https./
[23:58:28] <droptone> So even though I'm 301 redirecting the domain to aanother domaian entirely, I still have to buy a cert for the domain to be forwarded
[23:58:37] <Psi-Jack> Yes
[23:58:38] <droptone> ok
[23:58:43] <droptone> Well thank you, that explains it
[23:58:48] <Psi-Jack> Or just use Let's Encrypt. :p
[23:58:56] <c705> you don't have to purchase a cert, but you need a signed certificate
[23:58:57] <droptone> let's encrypt?
[23:59:05] <Psi-Jack> Free SSL Certificates. Look it up.
[23:59:16] <rob`> certbot is magical
[23:59:25] <Psi-Jack> No, certbot sucks. acme.sh is where it's at.
[23:59:29] <droptone> Yup, I'm on it, I'll just do self signed if the various mainstream browsers have it listed as a CA
[23:59:42] <Psi-Jack> Let's Encrypt is browser accepted.
[23:59:50] <droptone> great, thanks much
[23:59:58] <Psi-Jack> droptone: if you self-sign, users would still get stopped.
