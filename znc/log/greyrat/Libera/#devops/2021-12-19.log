[01:32:35] <Joel> rawtaz if you're already using ansible for cm, adding packer is just another un needed piece of software
[01:32:45] <Joel> rawtaz ansible can launch an ec2 instance, shut it down, and make an ami out of it
[01:32:52] <Joel> it's just three tasks.
[01:33:07] <Dus10> I pissed off some people with my opinion of using "other languages" instead of a DSL for IaC
[01:33:11] <Dus10> I feel proud
[01:33:20] <Dus10> if you get pissed about that, you're insecure
[01:33:21] <rawtaz> yeah. just doesnt seem like a job for ansible. its similar with tf - ansible can do most of what tf can, but you still use tf :)
[01:33:42] <rawtaz> Dus10: you mean the pulumi discussion?
[01:33:47] <Dus10> yeah
[01:33:56] <rawtaz> people in here?
[01:34:00] <Dus10> Joel: Packer is amazing, it isn't a burden to add it
[01:34:04] <Dus10> no, somewhere on Reddit
[01:34:16] <rawtaz> oh, so you made a comment somewhere
[01:34:18] <Dus10> as a matter of fact, Packer enhances Ansible
[01:34:40] <Dus10> Packer + Ansible is like Bread + Butter
[01:34:54] <Dus10> Packer just basically creates a scaffold and hands it off to Ansible
[01:35:01] <Dus10> when you're using the Ansible provisioner
[01:35:16] <Dus10> like, bye bye worrying about authentication
[01:35:19] <Dus10> Packer handles it
[01:35:39] <Dus10> I am thinking more and more that Ansible as a Pipeline should be a thing

[01:58:26] <rawtaz> Dus10: when you use packer, where do you send and store the artifacts? some local repo or directly to aws or similar?
[01:59:10] <Dus10> well, it depends on what you mean by artifact
[01:59:18] <Dus10> if you're talking image... it is build into it
[01:59:53] <Dus10> the nomenclature that they use isn't so hot...
[02:00:01] <Dus10> they use "source" instead of "resource"
[02:00:16] <Dus10> and "source" is where you define both the "source" and the "destination"
[02:00:35] <Dus10> so a source would be "azure-arm" for instance
[02:00:56] <Dus10> the capture of the image happens on the platform where it is executed, so the image resides there
[02:01:11] <rawtaz> well what you produce with it, i suppose it's an image regardless of type
[02:01:28] <Dus10> well, you could have things in addition to an image
[02:01:33] <Dus10> maybe logs, whatever
[02:01:42] <rawtaz> right yes
[02:01:43] <Dus10> packer just handles it, mostly
[02:01:45] <rawtaz> i mean the image :)
[02:01:54] <Dus10> if you define AWS, the image is going to live in AWS
[02:01:57] <rawtaz> let me rewind, where does your packer run? in some cloud or on prem?
[02:02:05] <Dus10> wherever you want
[02:02:12] <Dus10> PC, pipeline, etc
[02:02:16] <Dus10> just like Terraform
[02:02:17] <rawtaz> yes but in your case. but perhaps you have several
[02:02:35] <Dus10> I generally run mine in a pipeline
[02:02:44] <rawtaz> i was just curious if when you run it locally you shoot images it produces right up to e.g. aws image repos or if you store them locally instead
[02:02:52] <Dus10> Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions, Gitlab
[02:03:11] <Dus10> the images are local to where Packer is executing
[02:03:21] <Dus10> they're local to the platform where they're being produced
[02:03:38] <Dus10> if I am running Packer on my PC, the image is never on my PC
[02:04:07] <Dus10> if the "source" is "azure-arm" it build a VM in Azure and takes an image from it... and the image is in Azure
[02:04:28] <rawtaz> sure ok
[02:06:27] <Dus10> Packer is just talking to an API, just like Terraform
[02:06:59] <rawtaz> yeah
[02:07:06] <Dus10> so, bare bones... in Azure... it will spin up a Resource Group, a Virtual Network, a VM, and a Public IP Address that it locks down to your egress IP
[02:07:13] <Dus10> the VM runs in Azure
[02:07:41] <Dus10> at the end of the build, it tells Azure to create an image... that image, Packer doesn't download it... it leaves it in Azure
[02:07:53] <rawtaz> exactly
[02:07:57] <rawtaz> i agree
[02:07:58] <Dus10> you direct it where it Azure to store it, however
[02:08:25] <rawtaz> im mostly thinking of when you run it locally. if people then ever have it upload the resulting images to the cloud.
[02:08:28] <Dus10> like you can say to have a Managed Image and that just becomes some image in a Resource Group
[02:08:31] <rawtaz> or if that makes no sense ever :>
[02:08:32] <Dus10> or you can store it in a Shared Image Gallery
[02:08:48] <Dus10> it doesn't work that way
[02:08:58] <Dus10> the only way it could is if you run it against a local hypervisor
[02:09:13] <Dus10> but then you have to worry about image formats and if they're compatible
[02:09:27] <Dus10> you could easily do this with Hyper-V and Azure... but it would be silly, in my view
[02:09:56] <rawtaz> yes of course you'd have what you need to build it locally, e.g. a hypervisor or similar
[02:10:29] <rawtaz> but youre saying that i couldnt build an azure or aws image using a local packer?
[02:19:01] <Joel> rawtaz what are you using for config management now?
[02:20:24] <rawtaz> nothing
[02:20:52] <rawtaz> just dockerfiles and compose files, although that doesnt count
[02:21:45] <rawtaz> i dont have the type of environments you guys do
[02:22:21] <Joel> I mean honestly, that's the desired state.
[02:22:49] <Joel> a lot of people seem to have hard ons for packer, but in aws land, if you're already using ansible, there's 0 need to bring in packer.
[02:22:49] <rawtaz> to not have the type of envs you guys do? :-)
[02:23:29] <Joel> 100%
[02:23:38] <Joel> 99.9% of what I work with is ecs/fargate
[02:23:55] <Joel> plain ec2 instances is 2000 and late
[02:23:57] <rawtaz> i'd love to do that more. i know hwat i need to do to use these tools but i never get a chance to use them
[02:24:01] <rawtaz> it sucks
[02:24:11] <rawtaz> nice :)
[02:24:19] <rawtaz> but i guess you get tired of that in the end
[02:26:27] <rawtaz> so are you only doing aws stuff Joel or azure etc as well?
[02:26:56] <Joel> rawtaz only aws. I've not done time in azure/gcp land
[02:27:02] <rawtaz> :D
[02:27:31] <rawtaz> ive got a client who's slooowly luring me into azure land :F
[02:27:57] <Joel> I did a little time in oracle's cloud
[02:27:59] <Joel> noooo thanks
[02:28:25] <Joel> I should push into the other clouds, but I'm close enough to retirement idgaf
[02:28:52] <Joel> There's enough to keep me swamped in aws land
[02:29:10] <rawtaz> first it was just office 365. then a service needing to connec to AD DS, which requires a VPN to azure and some more stuff. and now it's looking like we need some contianer stuff in there as well, with additional VPNs and stuff around that
[02:29:24] <rawtaz> yeah, why bother. you're good where you are with aws :)
[02:29:49] <rawtaz> what was it you didnt like with oracle cloud? i have *no* idea what it "looks" like or how it is to work with, never saw anything about it
[02:32:00] <Joel> other than oracle? to get access to non intel hardware was something I spent 16 months chasing, and never got anywhere with, even though it's suppsoed to be a clear offering
[02:32:19] <Joel> and honestly, why else would you use them?
[02:36:12] <rawtaz> yep
[02:36:22] <rawtaz> they shouldnt be used at all
[02:36:26] <rawtaz> hm i wonder if larry has any friends
[02:44:16] <Joel> you know the difference between larry and god don't you rawtaz?
[02:44:23] <Joel> God doesn't think he's larry.
[02:45:21] <rawtaz> xD
[03:11:31] <Joel> rawtaz are you devops type role, sre, dev?
[03:18:55] <rawtaz> no general it consultant but with a programmer background as well as sysadmin, linux, mac, windows, networking, services, you name it
[03:19:59] <rawtaz> so i really do a lot of everything, but i have mostly small companies so there's never a point in making something cool like devops stuff
[03:21:24] <rawtaz> the systems i set up or get brought in to fix are the type that runs for years, not the throw away type needed for scaling
