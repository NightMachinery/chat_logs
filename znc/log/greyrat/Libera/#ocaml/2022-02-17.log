[01:16:13] <d_bot_> <anmonteiro> they both vendor the same deps so there are linking issues

[04:34:52] <d_bot_> <daccord77> Looking for a lightweight note-taking tool (not the Notion-like type:)) with native NFT support, any suggestions? I randomly found a project (web link): metanotey.io which looks promising. But still in early beta
[04:37:58] *** Joins: azimut (~azimut@gateway/tor-sasl/azimut)
[04:42:04] <companion_cube> I don't think people here particularly like NFTs
[04:58:32] <d_bot_> <mnxn> why on earth would you need NFTs in a note taking app?
[04:58:33] <d_bot_> <mnxn> this reads like an advertisement and also has nothing to do with ocaml
[05:00:23] <companion_cube> hu, good call
[05:04:09] <d_bot_> <mnxn> @admin I think this is advertising spam and should be removed
[05:04:41] <d_bot_> <mnxn> the user isn't even in the discord server anymore
[05:06:35] <companion_cube> lol, ok
[05:06:53] <d_bot_> <Perry> They remove the message, but the user was already gone.
[05:10:37] <d_bot_> <Perry> I presume everyone reported the spam btw, that alerts Discord.
[05:11:59] <d_bot_> <NULL> A Google search brought 3 results with one saying users reported the website as a scam, but I registered in (through Tor) and it looked decent and didn't try to make me buy stuff (not outright). So weird
[05:12:41] <companion_cube> a NFT editor can't be anything but a scam
[05:13:26] <d_bot_> <Perry> A spammer is a scammer.
[05:13:28] <d_bot_> <NULL> It looked like a notes app, nothing with NFT on the main page of the app
[05:13:53] <companion_cube> @Perry true.
[05:13:58] <d_bot_> <NULL> Not trying to appeal the ban/deletion at all, it looked way to suspicious
[05:14:35] <d_bot_> <mnxn> their core feature is a context menu to publish notes to an NFT marketplace
[05:15:34] <d_bot_> <mnxn> and it doesn't matter whether the website is legitimate or not, advertising like that is bad enough

[20:27:06] <d_bot_> <kurtz> late to the conversation but the "desktop" client doesn't have the report spam feature either which simply makes no sense to me?
[20:27:44] <d_bot_> <orbitz> I did notice if you go to the users profile you can report the user as spam
[20:27:51] <d_bot_> <kurtz> the best you could do is just block someone
[20:27:55] <d_bot_> <kurtz> hmm i must have missed that
[20:28:31] <d_bot_> <orbitz> oh wiat, maybe it's only the DM view.. which is odd

[21:16:01] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> Blocking's nice but I want Discord to have knowledge of the user's wrong doing, so that if a threshold of spam reports is reached, the user is suspended for review or something. Right now spam-bots have a field day in some servers.

[21:40:16] <d_bot_> <RegularSpatula> I had a small script and about 50% of the runtime was in the `Core.String.split` function.  So I did a quick benchmark on a couple of different string split function (Core's, a specialized version of Core's, and the OCaml stdlib's `split_on_char`).  Core's string split was a good bit slower than the stdlib's...it just got me wondering if there are any more benchmarks comparing Core and Stdlib.

[22:35:24] <d_bot_> <Butanium (@me on answer)> Does the Core one split on strings or on char ?
[22:36:47] <companion_cube> impressive that `split` is so much slower
[22:36:51] <companion_cube> I guess it's bound checks?
[22:37:07] <companion_cube> oh wait, you don
[22:37:14] <companion_cube> don't use String.index_from

[23:02:04] <d_bot_> <RegularSpatula> Here is Core's version: https://pastebin.com/5U0Fejpy
[23:02:57] <d_bot_> <RegularSpatula> ccube: The split you see there is basically Core's minus the part where they use an anon fun for checking the delimiter
[23:04:07] <companion_cube> that's in Core? :o
[23:04:22] <d_bot_> <RegularSpatula> yeah
[23:04:27] <companion_cube> I'm surprised, I would have expected some unsafe_get
[23:06:01] <d_bot_> <RegularSpatula> Yeah the stdlib one uses unsafe get to get the current char and check if it is the `sep`...core uses `str.[index]`
[23:06:18] <d_bot_> <RegularSpatula> Core's string `sub` function is also different from the stdlibs...
[23:06:26] <companion_cube> also, having the same function that handles a list of separators
[23:06:33] <companion_cube> clearly going to be less optimized
[23:07:17] <d_bot_> <RegularSpatula> yeah you can see in the little bench that just making a dedicated split function for one `char` and not changing anything else even helped a lot
[23:09:24] <d_bot_> <RegularSpatula> just for fun a did a split function that takes an already allocated array and fills that instead of a list (obviously brittle) ...it was a bit slower than stdlib split, but used half the words
[23:09:29] <companion_cube> tbh if you want real perf, of course, you shouldn't really split
[23:09:41] <companion_cube> just iterate on slices, without calling `sub`
[23:11:30] <d_bot_> <RegularSpatula> yeah thats true
[23:13:52] <d_bot_> <RegularSpatula> core has a slice, but it does allocate a new string for each slice...just give me the bytes (your favorite topic lol)

[23:34:21] <d_bot_> <keegan> is there a lib for emitting compiler diagnostics, e.g. in a compiler for highlighting lines and providing warnings/errors. even if I could use the one that the ocaml compiler uses if it's published on opam
