[00:30:39] <theprophet> guys, since python for loops and django template language loops are same, why do people still use DTL loops instead of direct python for loop?
[00:31:23] <theprophet> is there a specific reason for that? or its just a preferable thing?
[00:32:04] <Wooble> how are they "the same"?
[00:32:49] <theprophet> well, for example, in the scenario where you loop trough the database ,
[00:33:49] <theprophet> obj = Page.objects.all() ,,,, for o in obj works as well.
[00:33:55] <theprophet> like
[00:34:08] <Wooble> generally in a template you want to render each item in your iterable with some HTML; hardcoding that HTML in python code and then sending that to the template would be weird.

[00:34:58] <theprophet> wait, weird how?
[00:36:03] <Wooble> your view/logic should be separate from the template/display. having HTML in your python code breaks that separation. (plus you'd have to turn off autoescape)
[00:36:25] <theprophet> Wooble i see
[00:36:30] <Wooble> are you coming from PHP?
[00:36:41] <theprophet> no
[00:36:48] <theprophet> python is my first language
[00:38:06] <gordonjcp> theprophet: think about it this way - the view generates a bunch of stuff that is to be displayed but says nothing about how it is to be displayed
[00:38:12] <gordonjcp> theprophet: the template does the displaying
[00:38:14] <theprophet> i know the MVC rule but , for me to write a direct python for loop, makes more sense , rather then doing the same in DTL
[00:38:17] <gordonjcp> theprophet: you can change the template
[00:38:59] <theprophet> gordonjcp can you be more specific about 'the template does' part?
[00:39:18] *** Joins: GinFuyou (~GinFuyou@reya.cloud.tilaa.com)
[00:39:22] <gordonjcp> theprophet: the template takes a bunch of totally unstyled information and turns it into some sort of output
[00:39:28] <gordonjcp> theprophet: it doesn't even have to be HTML
[00:39:34] <Wooble> it makes more sense up until the point where the thing you want to do to each item in your loop is "throw some <li></li> around it and show it to the user"

[12:01:34] <humanBird> hrm. it still appears to be a django settings issue.   What is settings_module = os.environ.get(ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)
[12:01:48] <humanBird> ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE seems like a really weird name for an enviornment variable.
[12:02:07] <humanBird> this is inside the django project itself (not user code)
[12:02:16] <serafeim> lol
[12:02:32] <serafeim> is it `settings_module = os.environ.get(ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)` *or* `settings_module = os.environ.get('ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE')`  ?
[12:03:14] <humanBird> settings_module = os.environ.get(ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)
[12:03:34] <humanBird> copy pasted from this __init__.py file in django/conf
[12:03:36] <serafeim> well this means that the ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE is a variable that is set somewhere
[12:03:45] <serafeim> dont know where
[12:04:36] <humanBird> this isn't user code.  Shouldn't this be set somewhere? i see no where in the django docs a mention of this magic ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE
[12:07:14] <humanBird> hrm. how do i break there and put a watch etc?  or is this something terrible to do in python/django?

[14:07:04] <pendragon> hello
[14:13:33] <pendragon> I have some problems with static files and django. I am following a video tutorial from zappy code, but I have my project running on an digital ocean droplet with nginx and gunicorn, and I think that might be why I can't find the static files
[14:13:34] <pendragon> https://dpaste.org/cZYF
[14:14:28] <pendragon> I feel that I have tried alot, and I think I need someone else to point me in the right direction
[14:14:51] <GinFuyou> It's says found though...
[14:15:31] <pendragon> Yes that is what I think is weird
[14:15:42] <pendragon> localhost/static/portfolio/akersvika.jpg gives me a 404
[14:15:50] <GinFuyou> > STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static/') I hate such naming, most confusing, if it's from a tutorial, slap the author
[14:16:46] <pendragon> That is from the gunicorn tutorial I think
[14:16:47] <pendragon> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-20-04
[14:17:00] <apollo13> pendragon: try localhost/static/akersvika.jpg
[14:17:07] <apollo13> that file is not in the portfolio subfolder
[14:18:02] <pendragon> still 404. I have run collectstatic, so it's now both in my portfolio app (static/portfolio) and "base static app" in my main project

[14:19:47] <GinFuyou> "static/" is a default and typical dir for *source* of static files. naming STATIC_ROOT which is the destination of those, and putting it in project dir (and likely repo) - I don't understand who thought it's a good idea

[14:21:52] <apollo13> oh btw did you run collectstatic?

[14:23:00] <apollo13>         raise Http404
[14:23:03] <pendragon> Ok, so what harm can be done if I give you the url?

[14:23:49] <GinFuyou> likely, but well, caching...
[14:23:59] <apollo13> if you want to serve static files from gunicorn use whitenoise
[14:24:13] <apollo13> the builtin views only work for debug=true more or less
[14:24:34] <apollo13> you could use from django.conf.urls.static import static and serve via that, but…
[14:24:46] <GinFuyou> Or since you are doing it with nginx, serve static with nginx, which it does nicely
[14:24:51] <moldy> i know that many people like videos, but honestly: follow the official docs
[14:25:20] <moldy> videos might be plain wrong, or they might not cover your use-case
[14:25:40] <pendragon> I find it so weird, I can go to admin/css/autocomplete, and no problem, but portfolio gives me a 404 https://ibb.co/NrCzvNG
[14:27:07] <pendragon> Thank you for your help. But I think this is above my understanding. I'll look into whitenoise
[14:27:42] <moldy> how does the webserver config look like?
[14:29:11] <pendragon> https://dpaste.org/kBMg
[14:29:18] <pendragon> That is the gunicorn file
[14:50:25] <pendragon> So, I installed whitenoise, changed STATIC_URL to 'staticfiles', and STATIC_ROOT to BASE_DIR / "staticfiles", ran collectstatic and now it works!
[14:50:38] <pendragon> Thanks for all your help!
[14:50:46] <apollo13> you can keep STATIC_URL to static/
[14:51:12] <pendragon> No, that gives me an error
[14:51:37] <apollo13> which error?
[14:51:49] <pendragon> 404, it tries to open /static/akersvika.jpg
[14:52:05] <apollo13> then you still have something handling that URL or so

[14:52:45] <pendragon> Yeah I bet I have :(
[14:52:56] <pendragon> Is that a major problem further on?
[14:54:46] <moldy> you cannot serve static files with django / gunicorn (except if you use whitenoise)
[14:55:11] <moldy> you need to set up a webserver that serves them for you. or you can use django-storages with digitalocean spaces.
[14:55:32] <moldy> ah you switched to whitenoise, i missed that :)
[14:55:58] <apollo13> well you can serve them with django if you use the builtin serve() view, but that is not really recommended
[14:57:44] <pendragon> It's really just for testing if I can get a portfolio/resume thing up and running. For the first time I actually get the hierarchy/architecture of django, and how urls.py, models.py and others "talk" with eachother (on the most basic level, that is)
[14:58:13] <moldy> i thought the serve() view disables itself if DEBUG=False
[14:58:31] <pendragon> I make maps, so this is something brand new

[17:18:28] <tm007> What should be a good approach? Should I save the images in the given 3 sizes?

[17:19:44] <GinFuyou> what are other options?
[17:20:34] <tm007> Small is 256 px, medium: 1024, large: 2048
[17:20:36] <GinFuyou> Well, between 2, I'm not sure how we could know what your case requires
[17:20:37] <tm007> Width
[17:21:19] <tm007> Do you want me to describe my task more vividly?
[17:21:45] <GinFuyou> well, at least usage of different sizes of images
[17:22:07] <tm007> For example when displaying thumbnail
