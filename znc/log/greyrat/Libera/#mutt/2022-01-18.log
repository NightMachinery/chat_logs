[18:20:05] <ofm> hi all. Question: is possible to organize new recieved emails into a specific folder? if so, where I can find that information on how to configure?
[18:21:59] <ofm> the idea is to get new emails and send them to that specific folder, to read them latter... looks like a filter or so, but I am not sure
[19:07:50] <taman> ofm: yes (if I understand you...) but not with mutt. Look into 'sieve', probably available from your email provider.

[19:45:49] <dld> ofm: A very common organization is to use something like `getmail` to acquire email from a server, `procmail` to process (and filter, organize, etc.) mail, and then `mutt` to view/interact/send mail
[19:46:47] <dld> ofm: it is also possible to interact with email over IMAP, perhaps using a program like `imapfilter` or something.
