[09:00:34] <AsenMx> Hello, terraform question here. I have projects X and Y, they are both on AWS and use pretty much almost the same services (ecs,rds,route53) for example. I was wondering how to structure the terraform code, should I have 2 repositories X and Y and have a modules folder where I have modules for ecs,rds,route53 in each repository. Or have repository Z that holds ecs,rds,route53 modules,  source them in the X and Y project and just pass the variables to the 
[09:00:34] <AsenMx> modules. Not sure if my question make any sense, if it doesn't let me know.

[15:27:06] <rawtaz> AsenMx: if it makes sense to make parts of that stuff reusable, i dont see why you wouldnt do it. that is, assuming its possible to keep it generic enough so it doesnt become more complicated than its worth.

[22:04:24] <AsenMx> rawtaz, thanks for the answer. However, the problem is, that there are some modules that can't really be that reusable and I'm not sure what to do with them.
[22:11:40] <slaughter> Could you modify them in ways that would make them reusable? That would be the best bet. If you can't, IMO I'd still keep them in their own repo
[22:25:23] <rawtaz> AsenMx: if they cant be made reusable youll simply have to use them as they are. nothing wrong with that
