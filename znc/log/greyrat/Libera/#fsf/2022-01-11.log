[00:39:19] <zleap> i dunno
[00:39:24] <zleap> it is just confusing
[00:39:42] <Legend> I prefer a Pixel loaded with GrapheneOS
[00:39:45] <epony> blame the ARM chips
[00:39:55] <Legend> ARM is actually really damn good
[00:39:56] <epony> and the celluler cornpanies
[00:39:57] <Legend> security wise
[00:40:03] <epony> as good as shit
[00:40:10] <epony> I mean it has all the x86 flaws
[00:40:11] <zleap> so pixel is yet another phone thing, and grephene yet another OS that nothing runs on
[00:40:24] <Legend> personally, I think that Pointer Auth, and Memory tagging are excellent
[00:40:30] <epony> that it says it did not have, but it has them and is a trailing design with 10-20 years
[00:40:47] <White_Flame> pinephone isolates the cellular etc chips from the main memory system, so it's more secure, but not necessarily 100% freedom
[00:41:00] <Legend> zleap: GrapheneOS is based on android, Pixels are a brand of phones made by Google
[00:41:01] <epony> and USB is not necessarily isolation
[00:41:09] <zleap> ok
[00:41:14] <epony> DMA ftw
[00:41:28] <epony> I bet you can run code on the main CPU sent by the cellular network..
[00:41:43] <epony> just like you can on Apple and Android
[00:41:52] <Legend> White_Flame: there's something called IOMMUs
[00:42:07] <epony> and USB debug on the CPUs
[00:42:25] <Legend> and actually, pinephones are quite insecure
[00:42:28] <White_Flame> if the hardware switch does power down the cellular chip, then that measure of security would work, but yeah if there are still runtime means of access, who knows
[00:42:41] <epony> let's not get forgetful, ARM SoCs have management engines too
[00:42:51] <Legend> what's wrong witht that
[00:43:05] <Legend> zleap:  are you looking for a phone or something?
[00:43:23] <Legend> Intel ME is not a backdoor, nor is the ME in ARM
[00:43:25] <epony> everything in a mobile phone is an antennae
[00:43:52] <epony> and HW CPU bugs in ARM chips replicate the same faults as the ones in x86 chips
[00:44:00] <zleap> Legend,  not right now, I like the look of pinephone but it does not run the mastodon app
[00:44:03] <epony> "we're so advanced"
[00:44:28] <Legend> I mean, is there any alternative?
[00:44:41] <zleap> Legend, no idea, the ecosystem is confusing
[00:44:51] <Legend> not sure if x86 memory protection keys are as good as memory tagging
[00:45:05] <Legend> but they accomplish different things I believe
[00:45:12] <zleap> maybe what ewe DO need is a set of good tools for developing apps, and a community around that to help developers

[00:46:39] <epony> or, to use an own wireless repeater that you control completely
[00:47:02] <epony> (and use a cable link to your phone)
[00:47:04] <zleap> well a 4g/5g usb dongle thingy would do it, or

[00:47:48] <zleap> I try and look at things from a user viewpoint 
[00:47:49] <epony> why do you want to install the cellular network malware on your computers all the time?
[00:48:27] <epony> do you have some "special relation" to cellular ISPs?

[00:49:41] <epony> look after Stallman, he's a smart person
[00:49:50] <zleap> yeah
[00:50:06] <epony> that example may not be practical, but is indicative
[00:50:26] <zleap> ok so if I buy a phone, i don't want one that has all the google stuff on, i want to be able to disable tracking and instll the apps I want on
[00:50:36] <epony> he admits borrowing phones from people
[00:50:46] <epony> so.. many people can share a combined phone then

[01:04:17] <junebug> It's kind of unethical what corps are doing with our code. They don't contribute back or support individual developers. Some outright take your code and built a whole product around it making billions of your hard work.
[01:04:30] <junebug> off*
[01:04:42] <White_Flame> "freedom" means others can do things you disagree with, because they have freedom, too
[01:05:18] <White_Flame> and many people write code for it to be used, not to hold it ransom for fees

[01:09:33] <epony> the fact that Genera failed at commercialisation does not mean it was because it was social or socialist or technically sound..

[01:12:30] <White_Flame> "if all agree with each other" is idealism that can't apply to general masses of people

[01:22:56] <White_Flame> however, they might just use the AGPL, offer source, and still make billions and not pay
[01:23:14] <White_Flame> if their offering is more service/data/network-effects oriented, then the source code isn't the biggest thing of value
[01:23:27] <White_Flame> so you have to be willing to accept them able to do that
[01:23:43] * echoSMILE the world is doomed, even fsf website has popups!

[01:24:00] <White_Flame> if your primary "open source" license bars commercial use over $XXX, then you won't find such a contract under any fsf umbrella
[01:24:03] <junebug> I personally don't want them using my source code anywhere if they are a company. Only individual users should be able to do that

[01:24:17] <White_Flame> right, that'd be a non-fsf license
[01:24:27] <White_Flame> they're out there, nobody here is likely to be an expert on that
[01:24:29] <junebug> Ok. I'll look around

[09:15:32] <alMalsamo> Hey it would be pretty cool if the FSF gave some press to the Session messenger, which is GNU GPLv3 licensed and has end-to-end encryption by default (unlike Telegram) and has no central server like Signal, Telegram, Wickr, and Whatsapp for example, but rather a decentralized network of Sybil resistent service nodes around the world, so all Session traffic is onion routed, and it doesn't require an email 
[09:15:38] <alMalsamo> address or phone number or anything else to create a Session ID

[16:10:59] <lisbeths> Some blockchain technologies lend themselves to their code being audited.
[16:11:10] <lisbeths> Therefore it is possible to write webservices in the blockchain that are free software
[16:11:37] <lisbeths> It would enable something like gmail but instead of being centralized to google's servers it would run code everyone can read

[16:14:13] <DiffieHellman> There's not much point keeping every email around forever and there are much better implementations than what you can do with a blockchain for that sort of thing.
[16:16:29] <lisbeths> you could encrypt the mail

[16:20:28] <clever> DiffieHellman: ive seen an example of how you could use blockchains in a game, record the history of a weapon, and its sale between players, to a blockchain, and make is such that the more blood the blade is soaked in, the more powerful it gets, all logged in a blockchain
[16:20:55] <lisbeths> blockchain is not just for auditing processes but for general purpose computing
[16:21:47] *** Joins: ewwegweg (~ewwegweg@user/ewwegweg)
[16:21:58] <DiffieHellman> clever: Or just store the blood level into a database and update the value each kill?
[16:22:16] <clever> DiffieHellman: that requires a central authority to manage the database
[16:22:33] <clever> while a blockchain could let the game live on, even after the author ceases supporting it
[16:22:34] <DiffieHellman> A central authority is required to run the game anyway.

[16:23:34] <DiffieHellman> Yes, but all the servers need to keep in sync and the issues with syncing allows for individual peers to cheat a certain amount.
[16:23:38] <clever> and a blockchain is ome way to stop people from just cheating in items
[16:23:58] <DiffieHellman> Games already out-last the publisher as long as they're not chock full of digitial handcuffs

[16:24:55] <DiffieHellman> A free software game kept in the original state is not going to just stop working. The game can be ported to different OS's as the need arises too
[16:24:55] <clever> but you also have cases like the wii shop
[16:25:09] <DiffieHellman> The wii shop is still online.
[16:25:13] <clever> now that the shop has been closed, you cant download any games, including games you paid for
[16:25:24] <clever> i heard that nintendo shut it down years ago
[16:25:31] <clever> the services for the original wii console
[16:25:40] <DiffieHellman> There were a few
[16:26:07] <DiffieHellman> I'm pretty sure you can grab the proprietary games off NUS, and if you have the AES key, you can decrypt them. The store just doesn't give the AES key anymore.

[16:26:28] <clever> ah
[16:26:47] <clever> so basically, they deleted the database of who paid for what, and stopped handing out decryption keys
[16:26:54] <clever> and now your only choice is to pirate the games?
[16:27:30] <DiffieHellman> Nintendo Wi-Fi connection shut down years ago as gamespy decided to stop hosting the game servers (but wiimfi effectively replaced this, just with only limited support for certain games.).
[16:29:05] <DiffieHellman> clever: Please don't say "piracy", unauthorized copying is not morally equivalant to kidnap and murder on the high seas. In this case, this only authorized copying happens, as NUS agrees to serve an encrypted copy of WiiWare to anyone who asks
[16:29:37] <clever> NUS being?
[16:29:45] <DiffieHellman> Nintendo Update Service.
[16:29:48] <clever> ah
[16:30:06] <DiffieHellman> They seem to use the same servers for everything, so it'll all be up for a while yet.
[16:30:24] <clever> and they just havent garbage collected all of the old wii games?
[16:30:33] <clever> so its hosting files that nobody can official decrypt?
[16:31:03] <DiffieHellman> Well, you can decrypt them with a key provided by the wii shop in the past.
[16:31:29] <clever> but if i had to say factory-reset my wii, and then login with my old credentials, i'm screwed?
[16:32:41] <DiffieHellman> The shop just won't work, everything else will work though. You probably want to homebrew to avoid problems in tfe future.
[16:32:53] <clever> yeah
[16:33:53] <clever> the point i was kind of making, is that you could store the shop database on a blockchain for example, but you may need some nodes to act as a gateway for "light wallet" style clients
[16:33:54] <DiffieHellman> The connection test thing tries to connect to a domain that may eventually no longer exist, and at that stage, homebrewing will be a pain as you won't be able to use any internet based methods.
[16:34:01] <clever> so you dont have to store the entire chain on every console
[16:34:56] <DiffieHellman> A blockchain isn't really suited for that task, a distributed hash table would likely be better 
[16:35:27] <DiffieHellman> blockchains only really work if everyone has the blockchain.
[16:35:43] <clever> i usually think of a DHT as only persisting in ram, so a reboot of the entire network would wipe it
[16:35:47] <clever> but it could persist as well
[16:35:58] <clever> ipfs is one hybrid solution in that region

[16:36:34] <DiffieHellman> IPFS sadly lacks privacy - people can determine what you download.
[16:36:46] <clever> ipfs also basically acts like a tracker
[16:37:03] <clever> basically, the ipfs client creates a long-term keypair
[16:37:16] <clever> and every time your online, it stores your public ip in a dht, keyed by your pubkey
[16:37:28] <clever> so if i know your pubkey, i can track your ip in realtime, and know if your online

[16:54:40] <DiffieHellman> *aren't
[16:56:01] <DiffieHellman> The AGPLv3+ allows for freedom both in the software and in the usage of a webservice really.

[20:03:34] <zleap> is that before you move to a new school
[20:03:35] <AndrewYu> Having a hard time converting them from WC to XMPP, mostly because I don't use it much (UNIX philosphstuff)
[20:04:46] <AndrewYu> zleap: (We have nine years of missle school here, I'm at mid-eight)
[20:05:31] <zleap> ah ok
[20:05:50] <AndrewYu> I'm absolutely in favour of HyperbolaBSD
[20:06:01] <irelativism> that is smart
[20:06:14] <irelativism> linux kernel direction is not that sustainable
[20:06:26] <AndrewYu> I actually got fed up with Linux (and GNU) and moved to OpenBSD, seeing something like HBSD pop up is nice
[20:07:02] <irelativism> the benefits of copyleft paired with security
[20:07:07] <AndrewYu> Aww, life's so good now:  learning about the NH bill, HBSD, writing more emails (lol, the last one hasn't passed the mods yet), etc
[20:07:09] <irelativism> it is a huge undertaken though
[20:07:16] <zleap> I have a netbook with freeBSD on
[20:07:21] <irelativism> Hyperbola needs support from the movement
[20:07:22] <zleap> partly to play Nethack vulture
[20:07:27] <AndrewYu> Not mainly security I'm caring abouut, and yes
[20:07:38] <irelativism> if we want to se a viable alternative to Linux kernel
[20:07:56] <AndrewYu> I like GNU's political philosophy, but I don't like GNU software, too bloated
[20:08:08] <AndrewYu> The BSD userland utils are much cleaner
[20:08:33] <zleap> so hpw are you involved with Hyperbola ?
[20:08:38] <irelativism> security is just a consequence
[20:08:50] <AndrewYu> yes
[20:08:59] <AndrewYu> zleap: not much, I just looked it up

[20:15:55] <zleap> er ok
[20:16:03] <irelativism> so kernel will be packaged under the name hyperbk
[20:16:05] * zleap is not that technical when it comes to these things
[20:16:07] <AndrewYu> I'd say OpenBSD is a good approach.  Simple, free (the no-headers thing aren't suppoesd to be nonfree, contact-the-dev-to-add-header would work ig).
[20:16:16] <AndrewYu> Secure, of course.
[20:16:36] <AndrewYu> However, good luck getting the kernel to run on multi-core CPUs correctly
[20:16:48] <irelativism> the idea of modularity is off the the unix way and also to make it easy for other distributions like maybe funtoo or guix to use it
[20:17:19] <AndrewYu> True
[20:17:28] <irelativism> no need for multicore AndrewYu given this distribution goals
[20:17:33] <AndrewYu> I prefer the Lisp way of doing things though

I have much more success converting people to use Session, you should get your friends to install Session instead of XMPP (session is onion routed and there are no centralized servers like with XMPP and it doesn't rely on shitty DNS like XMPP does and it is not as metadata leaky)
[21:40:54] <alMalsamo> AndrewYu: https://getsession.org  (there is whitepaper linked on the home page for more info)

[21:44:31] <zleap> how much of this is do-able in china
[21:44:32] <alMalsamo> Session doesn't require e-mail address *or* phone number to use, and the service nodes provide onion routing that obscure your IP address automatically.

[21:48:38] <zleap> labrador, I am asking as AndrewYu is from China,  we are suggesting thjings like Session, Tor etc which is fine as long as people are able to use that within China
[21:48:55] <alMalsamo> But they tell me that they are afraid to use Tor because the CCP does deep packet inspection on Tor users and might interrogate or arrest you for using Tor

[21:49:06] <kompowiec> alMalsamo, you can send wikipedia articles via email if you want

[21:49:39] <zleap> alMalsamo, so based on that, if session routes in Tor then it could cause problems
[21:49:55] <alMalsamo> kompowiec: I do not like SMTP very much, it's unencrypted and metadata leaky and uses DNS and requires servers.
[21:50:17] <zleap> you can use gpg with e-mail
[21:50:33] <zleap> protonmail is e2e 
[21:52:26] <alMalsamo> zleap: Hmm but Session doesn't use Tor at all, it uses an entirely seperate onion routing network of Oxen Service Nodes (there are about 1.750 of these nodes all over the world atm), and it requires staking 15.000 Oxen cryptocurrency to run one of these nodes so there is a financial barrier to run a node preventing Sybil attacks.  These service nodes route all messenges for Session messenger and also route 
[21:52:32] <alMalsamo> Lokinet traffic, and also confirm transactions on the Oxen blockchain using Proof of Stake consensus mechanism (no shitty electricity-wasting mining) and Oxen is a CryptoNote-based coin so it is very private (fork of Monero)
[21:53:28] <zleap> a lot of this conversation is just too technical for me
[21:53:29] <alMalsamo> zleap: yeah I've used GnuPG in the past for conducting business via SMTP, but fat chance you could ever get the masses to adopt it, it is far too complicated.  Bringing advanced crypto to the masses requires a user-friendly app that hides the complexity of key management, and Session does an extremely good job of this.
[21:53:59] <alMalsamo> zleap: Which part did you not understand?
[21:54:05] <zleap> thunderbird seems to hide a lot of the complexity, but yes,  good point
[21:54:17] <kompowiec> in essence, it deprives you of the ability to manage them.
[21:55:22] <zleap> alMalsamo,  run a node preventing Sybil attacks. for a start
[21:55:43] <jacobk> I read somewhere that reccomending encrypted email is a bad idea because it's so complicated to get right.
[21:55:45] *** Quits: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy) (Quit: exiting 3.3)
[21:56:02] <alMalsamo> zleap: Also webmail providers storing GPG keys for you to make it easier to use but then it defeats the purpose of using GPG in the first place... back when I was doing business via SMTP a lot of people were using Hushmail but that service is not trustworthy to manage your private GPG keys server-side.  I don't know how Protonmail could solve this for example but I haven't looked into their service.
[21:56:10] <jacobk> "Recommending email encryption to at-risk users is malpractice." - https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html
[21:56:28] <jacobk> I don't know enough about encryption to know if it's true.
[21:56:41] <zleap> i agree it is too complex for many people
[21:56:50] <alMalsamo> jacobk: even if you encrypt SMTP messages there is still tons of metadata and the SMTP server can still track your location (unless you go extra and configure Tor) and it STILL relies on DNS
[21:58:10] <zleap> I tend to sign e-mail
[21:58:25] <zleap> the last e-mail i encrypted was to techlearningcollective
[21:59:55] <alMalsamo> zleap: Sybil attacks are a common attack on decentralized networks in computer security realm where a malicious actor can subvert a system by creating multiple identities.  On Tor for example the barrier to congfiguring a malicious exit node (or many) is extremely low, and the more nodes a malicious actor controls, the more likely it is this actor can deanomymize users.  See:
[22:00:00] <alMalsamo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack
[22:01:05] <alMalsamo> but with Oxen Service Nodes it requires 15.000 Oxen cryptocurrency to stake from the Oxen wallet software (which locks up these 15.000 coins and you can't spend them or transfer them anywhere else, but they still remain in your private wallet account) so there is a financial barrier to setting up a node which greatly slows down the process of starting malicious nodes
[22:01:36] <alMalsamo> These Oxen service nodes like I said are waht onion route Session messenger traffic (and Lokinet traffic)
[22:01:48] <alMalsamo> It's the only messenger app that doesn't rely on centralized servers
[22:01:58] <alMalsamo> and it is GNU GPLv3 licensed
