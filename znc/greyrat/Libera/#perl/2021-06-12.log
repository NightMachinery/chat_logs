[00:00:05] <Gin> I suppose it is an object, right?
[00:00:55] <Gin> Since "hello"->$len() works in my first snippet, I suppose "hello" should be an object since it isn't a class name according to perlop.

[00:12:41] <Adura> Yeah, Perl coders don't use camel case.
[00:15:06] <kaitlyn> "hello"->$sub works in that the right hand side is a sub routine reference so it doesn't need to be resolved, the left hand side is given as the first argument.  There is really two things going on, the first is resolving the method to call Foo::Bar->blee(1) will try to find the method in blee in Foo::Bar, and resolved it will function as
[00:15:06] <kaitlyn> Foo::Bar::blee("Foo::Bar", 1).  $obj->blee(1) will try to find the method blee in the inheritance path of $obj, then call it as Class::For::It::blee( $obj, 1).  "hello"->$sub, $sub is already resolved, and it's called, passing "hello" as an argument.  At least that's how I understand it.
[00:16:18] <simcop2387> kaitlyn: um, actually, that's all wrong.  completely, utterly wrong.  it's actually... :)
[00:19:09] <Grinnz> Gin: 'hello'->shift doesn't work because you have not defined a sub named 'shift' in the package 'hello'
[00:19:39] <Grinnz> Gin: bareword methods only are found within the inheritance tree of the class or object they are called on
[00:20:03] <Grinnz> 'hello' is not an object, but it is a string that can be used as a class name

[00:21:04] <Grinnz> Gin: perlop is kind of wrong there. if the right side is a coderef, the left side has no requirements
[00:21:46] <Grinnz> because a coderef doesn't require inheritance lookup
[00:23:07] <Gin> Grinnz: Doesn't the left hand side have to be an object?
[00:23:13] <Grinnz> no.
[00:23:31] <Grinnz> for bareword method calls, it can be an object or a string
[00:23:36] <Grinnz> for coderef calls, it can be anything
[00:24:16] <Gin> Grinnz: What do you by " 'hello' is a string can be used as a class name"?
[00:24:28] <Grinnz> any string can be considered a class name
[00:24:44] <Grinnz> but to actually have methods available in that class, you'd have to define them
[00:24:46] <Gin> A class name is also a type?
[00:24:50] <Grinnz> ?
[00:25:00] <Grinnz> a class name is a package name
[00:25:16] <Grinnz> hang on, i think you need to learn what objects are in perl
[00:25:27] <Grinnz> perldoc perlootut
[00:25:27] <perlbot> Grinnz: Your documentation is available at: https://perldoc.perl.org/perlootut
[00:25:44] <Gin> Ok
[00:26:06] <Gin> Actually I haven't learnt object in Perl yet.
[00:26:22] <Gin> But the question I had is related to object.
[00:26:47] <Grinnz> yes. so it's hard to answer until you understand what objects are
[00:26:54] <Gin> Ok
[00:27:27] <Gin> What I meant is that I regard the left hand side as a literal string
[00:27:44] <Gin> So the subroutine can manipulate it.
[00:27:57] <huf> "Foo"->bar() is the same as Foo->bar()
[00:28:16] <Yaakov> I LOVE YOU ALL WITH A GREAT HUGE LOVE
[00:28:26] <huf> unless of course, you have a sub Foo() {} defined :D
[00:28:38] <huf> in which case it's Foo()->bar() :DDDDD
[00:28:51] <Gin> But I just can't understand how a class name is passed in as an argument
[00:29:11] <huf> the thing to the left just becomes the first argument
[00:29:17] <huf> the other arguments come after
[00:29:18] <huf> that's all
[00:29:58] <Grinnz> it's how the arrow operator works
[00:30:20] <Grinnz> for both bareword method calls and coderef calls, the invocant (left side of arrow) is passed as the first argument
[00:30:28] <Yaakov> Grinnz: I ❤️  THE PERL 5 OBJECT MODEL

[00:32:25] <huf> that's a lot of love

[07:35:32] <GEttR> thanks Grinnz, simcop2387 - I only need SASL for some VPNs they've blacklisted, so i'll just avoid those
[07:36:25] <simcop2387> yea, it'll happen but it's not there yet.  i like using znc myself since i have a large number of clients and networks anyway so having a central spot to manage things is useful
[07:36:28] <GEttR> er VPSs
[07:36:40] <simcop2387> i'm sure there's VPNs at this point too :)

[14:50:19] <kensanata> package Foo; our $bar; $bar = 1; sub bar { 2 }; package Baz; print $bar; # prints 1 without qualification with Foo; is there a way to call bar() instead of Foo::bar()?
[14:52:21] <kensanata> Hm, I guess Exporter is the answer.
[14:53:25] <lopid> Baz doesn't know what bar() is, so yes
[14:53:25] <ology> Heh. I was typing that, but then was confused by the code and wasn't sure.
[14:57:17] *** Joins: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.113.167)
[14:57:50] <kensanata> OK. My next problem is that I'm in a plugin loading situation, so Foo.pl has package Foo; our $bar; $bar = 1; sub bar { 2 }; do "Baz.pl"; and Baz.pl used to say package Foo; our $bar; print $bar, bar(). Now I want Baz.pl to say package Baz; use Foo qw($bar bar); print $bar, baz(); but "use Foo" is weird, since it's Foo that's loading Baz via the "do" statement.
[14:58:00] <kensanata> Or am I overthinking it and Foo doesn't get loaded a second time?
[14:58:29] <kensanata> Probably faster to just give it a try...

[21:44:11] <mattf> no
[21:44:36] <Grinnz> if you're installing without root access to that system perl, it would do it anyway
[21:44:43] <Grinnz> perlbot: .bashrc local::lib
[21:44:44] <perlbot> Grinnz: If CPAN set up your local::lib and can't find the modules it installs, remove the lines it added to .bashrc and add the line: [ $SHLVL -eq 1 ] && eval "$(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)"
[21:45:08] <simcop2387> neat didn't know about that factoid

[21:46:50] <Grinnz> mattf: and to be clear, it's a better idea to use a local::lib than to install to system perl as root
[21:46:59] <Grinnz> perlbot: why not system perl
[21:47:02] <perlbot> Grinnz: 1) You can cause system libraries to find newer versions of modules than they were expecting, 2) If the package manager upgrades perl, your CPAN-installed modules will be broken, 3) On perls older than 5.12, updates to dual-life modules must overwrite core modules or they will appear not to update due to @INC order

[21:48:17] <Grinnz> yes. please do the thing suggested above
