[01:50:43] <ctcx> I dd-ed Arch ISO to a USB. Then I needed it back to normal use, so tried first Gparted. No partitions detected; creating one got error "device busy". So had to use wipefs to wipe the ISO stuff in USB. Now I could create partition and there's some data there already.
[01:50:48] <ctcx> However, maybe out of error or experiment, I ended up mounting /dev/sdX block device as type ISO9660. I expected it to fail... surprise: succeeded. Not just that: still some of the past stuff previously there, i.e., Arch's ISO stuff.

[04:44:41] <nothereisnotanam> probably an update to pango or something
[04:44:54] <nothereisnotanam> does it error out or just give a warning when started normaly

One of the monitors is connected via HDMI, the other via DisplayPort. Whenever I turn on or wake my system, if the DisplayPort-monitor wasn't already turned on and active beforehand, my system launches with the monitor disabled in
[06:57:40] <sleepyFairy> nvidia-settings.
[06:58:18] <sleepyFairy> What I've done so far is try to force the settings via the config to recognize the monitor regardless of whether it is on or not, with no success.

[07:45:05] <rcf> sleepyFairy: you don't normally do anything about it at all, identd is only really useful for multiuser systems to verify that a given logged-in user is who they say they are when connecting. 
[07:45:27] <sleepyFairy> yeah but if I do nothing about it I can't connect as I get disconnected directly after
[07:45:40] <sleepyFairy> or is the being disconnected unrelated to the ident thingy?

[07:48:06] <rcf> sleepyFairy: if you look at the hosts in each join/part message, you'll notice that nearly all of them have the ~ in front of the user. That means they are lacking an ident response as well.

[14:03:53] <gh555222> how do you make pacman work on a system that really has no gateway (only http, https, and socks proxies)
[14:05:28] <gh555222> I keep getting errors such as error: proxytunnel: signature from "Arch Linux ARM Build System <builder@archlinuxarm.org>" is unknown trust
[14:05:34] <Namarrgon> did you try the usual $http_proxy env vars?
[14:05:45] <mpan> gh555222: you may use the `XferCommand` setting in pacman.conf to configure arbitrary downloader (at the cost of not having parallel downloads and nice progress bars). Also pacman is using curl internally, so see if setting the relevant proxy environment variables is not enough.
[14:05:49] <grawity> that message isn't related to gateways
[14:06:01] <thurstylark> also
[14:06:02] <thurstylark> !alarm
[14:06:03] <phrik> If you're here because of an issue with your Raspberry Pi or other ARM device, join #archlinuxarm
[14:06:05] <grawity> it's related to the fact that importing keys isn't the same as trusting/approving them (unlike in apt)
[14:06:22] *** lordrishav_ is now known as LordRishav

[14:06:59] *** Joins: ncuxo (~ident@ip-109-43-115-219.web.vodafone.de)
[14:07:04] <grawity> pacman looks at GnuPG's WoT trust indication, so you'd need to e.g. sign it with your installation's local key (via `pacman-key --lsign`) or something similar
[14:07:50] <grawity> regular arch has two tiers (local key -> lsigns 'master' keys -> sign dev keys), not sure how it works in arch-arm with its central build system
[14:08:15] <Foxboron> grawity: lsigns the build key which signs all builds
[14:08:35] <Foxboron> which is what Arch would be doing with a central key scheme. Maybe even have master key holders sign the build key (but thats for the future)

[15:12:37] <evilop> grawity: so turn on headphone and it connects to your phone instead of the computer which is what you wanted it to connect to
[15:12:50] <evilop> and then you ahve to manually diconnect on the phone etc
[15:13:02] <evilop> and then google assitant randomly breaks because of that etc
[15:13:29] <evilop> its pretty sad because many headphones actually have hardware that supports 2 or 3 connections, they just don't enable it in the firmware

[15:15:21] <The-Compiler> on a completely different note, any idea why I have broken DNS in Docker and never managed to fix it? I get e.g. "Temporary failure resolving 'archive.ubuntu.com'", the /etc/resolv.conf in the container has "search home" (huh?) and "nameserver 10.10.0.2", and I use systemd-resolved outside of the container...

[15:16:43] <The-Compiler> According to the Arch wiki "Additionally, a special case is handled if 127.0.0.53 is the only configured nameserver. In this case, Docker assumes the resolver is systemd-resolved and uses the upstream DNS resolvers from /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf." - that's the case for me, and /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf contains 192.168.1.1 and some ipv6 nameservers - so where the hell is that

I'm trying to set-up my ssh keys for two separate github accounts by specifying in OpenSSH ~/.ssh/config file the `CertificateFile` with public key, but it seems to be ignored and I end up being authed to github with wrong account.

[18:47:11] <famus> I'm not positive but I feel like the "exit" command after the systemctl suspend causes the script to exit. So it would suspend, wake up, exit the script, and therefore be not running.

I replaced pulseaudio with pipewire and followed everything on the wiki, including forgetting the 2.4ghz wifi networks so i dont accidentally connect, but something is still wrong. it seems that on reboot if i connect to it it works okay but still stutters
[20:37:10] <bin> a little, but then if i disconnect and then reconnect it stutters all the time. my music player is mocp but i confirmed the issue in vlc as well.
[20:37:38] <bin> interestingly when i first connect to it, mocp seems to freeze, and then if i switch back to internal speakers it unfreezes

[21:58:27] <agvantibo> Hello, I have a Lenovo C5621 PCI WWAN modem up and running with ModemManager + NetworkManager + ModemManager GUI, and I have a voice-call capable SIM on hand (my phone's, incidentally). How can I make and receive phone voice calls with it? I googled this question before, but nearly all answers I found have either mentioned only SMS or stated that the SIM wouldn't allow voice calling. A graphical solution would be doubly appreciated. Thanks in 
[21:58:27] <agvantibo> advance.
[22:00:28] <teraflops> bin the only reason I keep using pulseaudio is because there is AAC LDAC and APTX for bt
[22:00:40] <teraflops> no other reasons ohnestly
[22:00:44] <bin> i think pipewire has that 
[22:00:45] <gehidore> only reason I keep using it is I'm too lazy to switch
