Imagine native DLL with c# marshaling wrapper as static functions inside .exe assembly.

[03:43:08] <k0fein> possible?

[10:49:56] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: It is REALLY shitty that Tado doesn't work without internet.
[10:50:13] <MatthiasVance> app / plans
[10:50:57] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: yes
[10:51:08] <Nasp> Have you run into an issue?
[10:51:42] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I have had "no internet" at 2 seperate times in 24h
[10:51:46] <MatthiasVance> Rebooting router worked
[10:56:20] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Also getting floor heating in several places this year so need zone valves which means more Tado thingies, maybe I have to review if Tado is the "final" solution :D
[10:56:33] <MatthiasVance> I would love to be able to hide the water temperature tile as well since that ALWAYS needs to be at max
[10:56:42] <MatthiasVance> Granted I have never e-mailed them :P
[11:00:27] <Nasp> I wish more iot had local control
[11:00:34] <Nasp> Kinda what you should aim or when buying
[11:03:01] <Suchiman> hmmm... VS2022 is really unstable at work for me, like, i click somewhere and it just freezes, "This delay will be reported"...
[11:03:05] <Suchiman> at home it seems to work fine, weird
[11:03:42] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Yeah it's a bullshit reason for Tado I suppose too? They already have that tiny hub that could just send things over the network
[11:05:03] <MatthiasVance> Keeping the schedules in there and a timer chip doesn't seem "too hard"?
[11:12:47] <entropygain> how do people put all the cables in the "back" of cases? no matter what I do I have to have some floating on top of the mobo .. I try to ziptie and all but my cable management is cringe compared to things I see other doing ..
[11:13:07] <entropygain> I had to change my PSU + RAM and it took me almost 2 hours because I had to take out so much stuff to reach what I need
[11:13:14] <MatthiasVance> entropygain: I feel that so much
[11:13:35] <MatthiasVance> entropygain: I aso have figured out some stuff! It depends on your case and where your PSU is
[11:13:52] <MatthiasVance> And sometimes special cables
[11:14:56] <entropygain> I feel like I just have to start all over if I want to do a better job
[11:15:09] <entropygain> im just not even sure that all the cables would fit through the hole the case provides
[11:15:38] <entropygain> but the PSU is below the mobo if you were to lay the comp on the side and look at it from an eagle eye view
[11:17:51] <Suchiman> entropygain: another pain point is the GPU which is so tight in the case xD
[11:18:21] <entropygain> yep and i have to have things going around it
[11:18:28] <entropygain> GPU itself needs power too
[11:18:59] <entropygain> i had to take out the GPU and liquid cooling stuff so that i can get the PSU hooked up right
[11:19:16] <Suchiman> entropygain: do you have an appropriately sized power brick for the 850W RTX 4090 :P ?

[11:28:21] <peterR``> *** Memory leak detected: 5 allocation(s) not deallocated ***
[11:28:50] <peterR``> it also happens when debugging and stepping over the final brace of main
[11:29:06] <Suchiman> peterR``: that's some native dependency that is running with a debugging memory manager
[11:29:34] <peterR``> hmm, like a native nuget package you mean?
[11:29:50] <Suchiman> peterR``: well anything that does PInvoke and executes like C or C++ code
[11:30:01] <Suchiman> peterR``: that's not a .NET message
[11:30:24] <peterR``> OK, thanks - I will look at the native packages - there are some
[11:31:01] <Suchiman> peterR``: however that is not necessarily the fault of the native dependency if you have forgotten to Dispose stuff that can cause leak in native components too :P

[12:04:31] <MatthiasVance> then again, I believe you start with an SP, then create a scope and that's a new "scoped SP" right?
[12:07:17] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: But their hub isn't offline as i remember?
[12:07:42] <Nasp> Everything should just be zigbee, and then we should have some standard for a zigbee hub to send data to cloud

[14:03:14] <smallvil_> would this
[14:03:15] <smallvil_> ArraySegment<float> f = new(points, offset, count - offset);
[14:03:45] <smallvil_> be equivilant to    float * f = ptr;    f + offset;
[14:04:15] <canton7> I don't know what you mean by 'float * f = ptr;    f + offset;'
[14:04:59] <canton7> Note that ArraySegment<T> has basically been replaced by Span<T> these days
[14:05:23] <Suchiman> smallvil_: basically, + that it also restricts how far you can advance the pointer
[14:06:19] <smallvil_> 20:34:12 canton7: I don't know what you mean by 'float * f = ptr;    f + offset;'
[14:06:23] <smallvil_> its from C++ code
[14:06:29] <smallvil_> Suchiman: hmm ok
[14:07:04] <Suchiman> smallvil_: but yeah nowadays Span is used which is a uniform abstraction over any kind of linear memory
[14:07:15] <Suchiman> smallvil_: be it array, stackallocated memory or native memory
[14:07:51] <canton7> smallvil_, right, but 'f + offset;' on its own does nothing.
[14:09:31] <canton7> Did you mean 'f += offset' maybe? Or perhaps 'f = ptr + offset'? And the C++ code doesn't have 'count', so it can't be exactly equivalent
[14:10:04] <smallvil_> the exact C++ code i am trying to port is this
[14:10:22] <smallvil_> https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/libs/hwui/jni/android_graphics_Canvas.cpp;drc=2dc632aee35ff3ae39c23baea8d080583b5bfe1e;l=277
[14:10:57] *** Joins: exvicesindaco (~exvicio@user/exvicesindaco)
[14:13:07] <canton7> smallvil_,  'Span<float> f = points.AsSpan(offset, count)' would be idiomatic these days
[14:13:49] <canton7> Note that in your linked code, I think 'count' is the number of elements to take after 'offset', which doesn't quite line up with how you used it in your 'ArraySegment' snippet
[14:15:14] <smallvil_> the drawLines converts to https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/libs/hwui/SkiaCanvas.cpp;drc=00af5271dabd578397176eda0cd7a66c55fac59a;l=456

[14:25:20] <teegee> or do I have to make events to post data back?
[14:27:05] <Nasp> Is there a prettier / easier way to do a route like this? [Route("/DoThis/{type:regex(^(foo|bar)$)}")]
[14:27:11] <smallvil_> oh
[14:28:08] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Well we did all the ceilings, walls and electricity etc and knocked down a wall to the kitchen when we bought the house, now it's time for bigger roof so we have a good office there, putting sand under the floor and pouring concrete, extension at the back for washer/dryer etc.. replacing all windows + glass, new bathroom and toilet downstairs and floor heating in most places so yeah pretty big project..
[14:28:44] <MatthiasVance> Putting in 40+% of the original purchase price for this remodel :o

[14:31:40] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  At what point is it cheaper to just bulldozer the entire thing and build a new house?
[14:31:52] <Nasp> My brother have done about the same and spent more money on renovating a house than just bulldozing it
[14:32:32] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: That point is way higher :P
[14:32:42] <Nasp> Houses are cheap to build
[14:32:46] <Nasp> Location isn't D:
[14:33:32] <MatthiasVance> It would need to look the same as the other houses in the street though and stuff like that
[14:33:37] <MatthiasVance> So there are a lot of caveats there
[14:36:21] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: You're right you pay for location
[14:37:02] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: You live in a place where that's required?
[14:37:11] <Nasp> Like zoning rules
[14:37:17] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I think in most places in NL that's the case
[14:37:26] <Nasp> Do you like in an old house?
[14:37:27] <MatthiasVance> Unless you have a big swath of land
[14:37:30] <MatthiasVance> 1965
[14:37:36] <Nasp> So not that old
[14:37:41] <MatthiasVance> Or somewhere around there
[14:37:49] <MatthiasVance> Haha no but it feels old since nobody has upgraded it since
[14:37:50] <Nasp> More like if you were living in an older part of a town where they didn't want to ruin the esthetics
[14:37:57] <MatthiasVance> Ahh no
[14:38:04] <Nasp> Like my fathers house is from the 1700s
[14:38:11] <Nasp> He isn't allowed to change the look of it
[14:38:32] <Nasp> But in general i would assume most zoning laws you can still build a new modern house
[14:38:38] <Nasp> Unless it has to be a special style
[14:39:01] <smallvil_> hmmm
[14:39:09] <smallvil_> why does this work      pts[i].X = points[pi + 0]; pts[i].Y = points[pi + 1];
[14:39:46] <smallvil_> but this fail      pts[i].Set(points[pi + 0], points[i + 1]);       /* ... */    public static void Set(this SKPoint point, float x, float y) { point.X = x; point.Y = y; }
[14:40:16] <Suchiman> smallvil_: the extension method takes SKPoint by value while the array access is by reference
[14:40:29] <Suchiman> smallvil_: try this ref SKPoint point
[14:40:41] <smallvil_> hm ok
[14:40:57] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Technically I am not allowed to choose paint color of the outside I think, I say technically because that's not an issue I think but it's in the old rules
[14:41:19] <smallvil_> so        `this ref SKPoint point`      ?
[14:41:28] <Suchiman> smallvil_: that's what i said :P
[14:41:33] <smallvil_> ok :)
[14:41:54] <smallvil_> also if it is a ref does that mean i cannot invoke it with point as null?
[14:42:02] <smallvil_> eg   Set(null, 0, 0);
[14:42:09] <Suchiman> smallvil_: well you couldn't do that in either case
[14:42:12] <smallvil_> even if Set checks for null point
[14:42:26] <Suchiman> smallvil_: i assume SKPoint is a struct right
[14:42:32] <smallvil_> yes
[14:42:43] <Suchiman> smallvil_: structs cannot be null and C# does not allow ref's to be null either
[14:42:49] <smallvil_> ok :)
[14:44:01] <smallvil_> should i reference always this by reference in extension functions?
[14:44:09] <Suchiman> smallvil_: depends
[14:44:25] <Suchiman> if you intend to modify the original value and it's a struct, yes
[14:44:30] <Suchiman> by necessity
[14:44:45] <Suchiman> if you don't want to modify it but the struct is very large and copying overhead is significant, also consider ref
[14:44:52] <Suchiman> (or in if that works, cant remember)
[14:44:58] <Suchiman> (`in`)
[14:45:19] <Suchiman> smallvil_: otherwise no, for classes there's little point in doing that
[14:48:03] <smallvil_> alright

[15:08:50] <MatthiasVance> Almost yes
[15:08:56] <MatthiasVance> 3.5 months to go
[15:09:17] <Nasp> Some ELM, backbone, jquery, angular / whatever else what hot at some point
[15:09:19] <MatthiasVance> Kingsy: First thing that comes to my mind .. you don't go to the same website when you go by IP ;)
[15:09:31] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Yeah same
[15:09:31] <Nasp> Should you still write .NET Core when it's 5/6 and up?
[15:09:37] <bomb> that's half fucking decade. I remember I discussed it with a guy when I was super-drunk, it was new and shiny
[15:09:46] <Nasp> Isn't that the only name that kinda says it's the "newer" .NET
[15:09:56] <Kingsy> its 100% the same. I basically its a local minikube cluster. if I hit the nodeport it works when I hit the dns in my hosts file pointing to the same ip. I get that error in the console.
[15:10:00] <Kingsy> but it renders the html
[15:10:47] <MatthiasVance> We need more context, like some code :D
[15:10:58] <bomb> what is a nodeport?
[15:11:07] <MatthiasVance> Kingsy: Is it configured to host a website for that DNS record?
[15:11:14] <MatthiasVance> Kingsy: Because just patching it through it not the same
[15:11:31] <MatthiasVance> *is not always the same
[15:11:44] <Kingsy> there isnt really any custom code. I just ran dotnet new mvc -o HelloWorldAspNetCore
[15:11:56] <MatthiasVance> Ah so it's running Kestrel
[15:12:01] <Kingsy> MatthiasVance: the k8s cluster is yes.
[15:12:10] <Kingsy> let me show you the dockerfile
[15:12:38] <Suchiman> Kingsy: where do you get that error? browser?
[15:12:58] <Kingsy> https://bpa.st/KPXA
[15:13:10] <Kingsy> Suchiman: yeah in the dev tools console in the browser.
[15:13:21] <Kingsy> it renders the markup. just no css or anything
[15:13:32] <Suchiman> Kingsy: what does the server actually reply? does it look correct?
[15:13:44] <Suchiman> Kingsy: check the network tab
[15:13:51] <Kingsy> oh yeah the markup is correct. and there are no 404s
[15:14:11] <Suchiman> Kingsy: content-type?
[15:15:32] <Kingsy> hello-world.info in the network tab has a Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
[15:16:04] <MatthiasVance> Why do you have an index.html when you have an MVC application?
[15:16:21] <Kingsy> ah I just meant its called "index" as a source of the error
[15:16:25] <MatthiasVance> ohh
[15:16:49] <MatthiasVance> Have you done a comparison of the source?
[15:16:52] <MatthiasVance> (in the browser)
[15:16:56] <MatthiasVance> And requests etc
[15:17:17] <Nasp> Why is it people find oauth so complicated
[15:17:24] <Nasp> They look at it for 2 seconds "nope" give me my api keys
[15:17:32] <Kingsy> MatthiasVance: um moment.
[15:18:41] <ki9d> I love svelte! bomb
[15:18:43] <Nasp> EU needs to be gas independant of Russia
[15:18:50] <Nasp> Instead countries like Qatar instead

[15:22:33] <MatthiasVance> How can that even happen lol
[15:22:36] <MatthiasVance> Scam?
[15:23:25] <xb0o2> Turns out someone has basically gone to the industry database and put a duplicate supply in for the same meter and they're trying to bill me for it
[15:24:08] <xb0o2> So, according to the industry database, there are two different 'supplies' into the same meter.
[15:24:30] <xb0o2> Good database.
[15:24:37] <MatthiasVance> Wow okay
[15:25:11] <xb0o2> I've pointed this out to the random new supplier and they've basically said "well we searched the database and we came up so pay us".

[15:26:34] <xb0o2> And of course, as the consumer with no actual way to resolve the issue, I now need to chase them around to get them to sort it out.

[18:52:23] *** Guest78 is now known as jonp
[18:53:31] <canton7> alguien, any more details? Where exactly are you looking?
[18:53:34] <alguien> jonp, yes, that's the TSource. I understand that it is a value type and and its default is a value. But the return type of the Method is TSoruce?
[18:53:53] <alguien> canton7, I'm looking for FirstOrNull :)
[18:54:00] <canton7> What is FirstOrNull? :)
[18:54:04] <jonp> the return type of FirstOrDefault<TSource>() is TSource, yes.
[18:54:09] <MatthiasVance> Lukky: You need a new one?
[18:54:31] <alguien> jonp, it's TSource? according to my intellisense
[18:54:33] <canton7> For an unconstrained generic type `T`, `T?` means that `T` is "defaultable" -- if `T` is a reference type, then `T?` means that the reference can be null. If `T` is a value type, `T?` has no meaning
[18:55:02] <alguien> canton7, wut. I did not know that
[18:55:09] <canton7> It's annoying that `T?` means different things depending on whether `T` is constrained to a value type, or is a reference type / unconstrained
[18:55:15] <alguien> yes
[18:55:18] <canton7> It's part of the nullable reference types stuff in C# 8
[18:56:34] <alguien> I haven't had a chance to work on a project which uses that feature yet
[18:58:15] <alguien> But why wouldn't T? mean T-nullable? Is there a reason why it's ignored for value types?

[18:59:03] <jonp> `int?` is `Nullable<int>`
[18:59:20] <jonp> `string?` is still just System.String, with a C# attribute saying "won't be null"
[18:59:41] <alguien> you mean might be null?
[18:59:44] <jonp> `T Method<T>(…)` can't return "both" `Nullable<T>` *and* T
[18:59:51] <jonp> alguien: er, yeah
[19:00:13] <alguien> so why would `T?` where T=int be int and not `int?`?

[19:00:46] <alguien> codebase limitations
[19:00:50] <jonp> `new int[].FirstOrDefault()` will return `int`, not `int?`
[19:01:01] <jonp> and will have the value 0
[19:01:02] <alguien> yes
[19:01:26] <jonp> while `new string[0].FirstOrDefault()` will return `string?`, with value null
[19:01:31] <alguien> And that's fine because it's called FirstOrDefault
[19:01:36] <MatthiasVance> Nullable reference types drove me away from C# :P
[19:01:44] <jonp> MatthiasVance: :-(
[19:02:01] <MatthiasVance> jonp: Still on .NET!
[19:02:27] <canton7> I like them. In practice I think they work better than the alternatives that other languages have come up with
[19:02:30] <alguien> But why couldn't I make FirstOrNull that returns T?, and then be forced constrain FirstOrDefault that returns T? to reference types, and add a one that returns T for value types?
[19:03:14] <canton7> What *is* FirstOrNull? Is it a typo of FirstOrDefault?
[19:03:33] <MatthiasVance> Can you overload the default? :D (that would be crazy?)
[19:03:34] <jonp> alguien: you could do a `T? FirstOrNull<T>(IEnumerable<T> sequence) where T : class`
[19:03:43] <jonp> but you'd need the constraint for it to make sense
[19:03:44] <alguien> canton7, no, it's a hypothetical function that returns null given an empty array of value elements
[19:04:13] <canton7> alguien, how does that differ from FirstOrDefault? Does it return a Nullable<T> for value types?
[19:05:01] <canton7> If so, you're out of luck. You can't overload based on generic type constraints annoyingly, so you can't have one overload which returns Nullable<T> when T is a value type, and another overload which returns T? for reference types
[19:05:09] <alguien> jonp, no, I want FirstOrDefault to have to be constrained. Otherwise, as I undersatnd, FirstOrNull for value types can't be done (which is how it is now)
[19:06:03] <alguien> canton7, *sad nod*
[19:06:33] <canton7> But you can write a FirstOrNull which applies just to value types of course, then T? will mean Nullable<T>
[19:06:36] <Nasp> I just found a bit of a funny bug. Someone starts a background timer in a Request. This timer is for updating an InMemory cache of items that needs to be fast to acess, but the logging still thinks this is in a Http request because that's where it originated
[19:06:43] <alguien> canton7, but that's not what I need :D
[19:06:55] <canton7> Well, I'm still struggling to find out what you need
[19:07:23] <alguien> canton7, I really want to use a default if no element matches the predicate
[19:07:36] <alguien> I guess I can compare with `default`..
[19:07:48] <alguien> default coalescing operator ;)
[19:08:07] <canton7> alguien, can you give an example? "Use a default if no element matches the predicate"?
[19:08:31] <canton7> Presumably that's a different meaning of 'default' to the one in 'FirstOrDefault', i.e. it doesn't mean 'default(T)'?
[19:08:51] <alguien> canton7, yes
[19:09:04] <canton7> So, what default do you want to use? Something that you specify?
[19:09:07] <alguien> it's complicated. I have a dictionary of regex-to-delegate pairs
[19:09:15] <alguien> if a URL matches a regex, I want to call the delegate
[19:09:24] <canton7> i.e. is this DefaultIfEmpty(x)?
[19:09:44] <alguien> var whatToCall = dict.FirstOrDefault(x => x.IsMatch(myUrl))?.Value ?? defaultDelegate
[19:11:01] <alguien> canton7, no, it's just that no regex may match. That's the case in which I want to call the defaultDelegate
[19:11:34] <canton7> dict.Where(x => x.Key.IsMatch(myUrl)).Select(x => x.Value).DefaultIfEmpty(defaultDelegate).First() ?

[19:11:53] <alguien> canton7, hm
[19:11:57] <canton7> The annoying part is the .Value projection
[19:12:05] <alguien> nah, that's fine
[19:13:07] <alguien> I'm just concerned it may not be very lazy. It won't filter everything first, before plucking out the first thing, right?
[19:13:42] <alguien> (I'm basing this assumption off of nothing)
[19:13:57] <canton7> "plucking out the first thing"?
[19:14:18] <canton7> They're both as lazy as each other, but mine will do a bit more work, simply because there are more linq calls
[19:19:07] <alguien> canton7, I appreciate the solution

[19:27:29] <alguien> it's all in one spot that way
[19:28:03] <alguien> i just don't like that it has to regex-match the whole url for the default case
[19:28:35] <alguien> it's also not fool proof
[19:28:58] <canton7> I don't follow -- regex-match the whole url?
[19:29:13] <canton7> Oh, you mean the ".*". I meant I preferred the 'var whatToCall = dict.FirstOrDefault(x => x.IsMatch(myUrl))?.Value ?? defaultDelegate'
[19:29:41] <canton7> Also remember that dictionaries do not guarantee order, so "at the end" has no meaning. The ".*" entry can be checked first
