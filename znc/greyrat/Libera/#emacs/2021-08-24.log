[00:39:31] <carbonfiber> hope this is not off-topic. Does anyone know which editor was the first editor to support highlighted text selections? Was it GNU Emacs? Does anyone know of  a webpage that has some history on the early days of text editors with support for highlighted text selections?
[00:41:20] <rpav> surely it was mother of all demos but it was almost certainly a lot older than emacs

[00:49:49] <hodapp> 'highlighted' can also be a little vague, e.g. if you can set a mark and deal with a range of text, does that count as highlighting?
[00:51:04] <carbonfiber> highlighted means visually highlighted. so visually changed somehow.
[00:54:37] <rpav> how recently did emacs even _get_ 'hilighting' vs mark/point
[00:55:00] <rpav> i thought the transient mark or whatever was post-xemacs stuff
[00:55:15] <carbonfiber> hmm. no idea.
[00:55:29] <carbonfiber> i thought emacs had it from the beginning.
[00:55:55] <carbonfiber> does mg have highlighted selections/marks?

[00:57:37] <carbonfiber> vi (from 1976) is probably the first commonly used editor that had a visual cursor you could move. The first emacs release is according to wikipedia from 1985. So was there really no other editors in-between that time period?
[00:58:10] <bremner> there was earlier versions of emacs, I think
[00:58:32] <bremner> I used emacs on multics in 1985, and it was at the end of it's life cycle, not the beginning
