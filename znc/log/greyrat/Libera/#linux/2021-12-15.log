[04:27:17] <[R]> thad_the_man: 1) depends on the UI library, most should have the capacity for it though.  2) Possibly, X was designed in such a way that a remote system can create a window, there's no way for the X server to reliably know the PID of such a client.
[04:27:30] <Dagmar> Without that you're kinda screwed because X isn't generally aware of process ids

[04:32:49] <[R]> That would lead to bad problems
[04:33:11] <thad_the_man> Why?
[04:33:29] <[R]> Someone tries to kill a window by PID instead of by window-id

[04:42:08] <blackgatonegro> you just ended disabling it due to wanting more speed
[04:42:28] <Dagmar> Fake transparency leads to fun scenarios like not realizing there was an update to th window that was half-under something else

[04:48:15] * n4dir wonders what the heck expose might be
[04:48:28] <blackgatonegro> On Linux you can just program the windows key to just to tab without the need of alt
[04:48:40] <kveroneau> It's called "Present Windows" on Linux, Apple called their version Expose.
[04:48:58] <Dagmar> That's the thing htat shows you vignettes of all the app windows at once, right?
[04:49:00] <kveroneau> There's a hyphen on the last "e".
[04:49:15] <Dagmar> That's not a hyphen.  heheh
[04:49:17] <kveroneau> Yup, in a bunch of live thumbnails.
[04:49:33] <blackgatonegro> I wanna name a dog windows so when it leaves a "present" is funny
[04:49:41] <kveroneau> Super useful when you can't find a specific window, or it's just hiding under something else.
[04:50:12] <Dagmar> I chuckle becuase I just had to bend some "rules" with respect to a process involving CSV
[04:50:31] <blackgatonegro> CSV stands for?
[04:50:31] <kveroneau> Ever since KDE 3.5, I started really loving Linux more so for it's productive eye-candy I couldn't find on Windows.
[04:50:39] <Dagmar> The data supplier is sending what _mostly_ conforms to CSV, but there are user's names with i18n characters in them, which is very much not ASCII
[04:51:00] <blackgatonegro> cause it sounds like a file name extension to me.
[04:51:05] <n4dir> i decided long ago the best idea for me is to simply know where my windows are
[04:51:14] <Dagmar> I had to cook up a regex to handle those appropriately without risking something stupid on the far side winding up in an escape scenario elsewhere down the line
[04:51:16] <kveroneau> SuperKaramba had some really use widgets, at least when compared to the current offerings of Vista, it's no wonder a lot of people never used Vista widgets, there wasn't any worth using.
[04:51:26] <kveroneau> s/use/useful/
[04:51:40] <blackgatonegro> People still use Vista?
[04:51:47] <Dagmar> So much fun to create a regex that singles out things from 8859-1/15
[04:51:49] <Dagmar> :/

[07:17:44] <dfcnvt> I've decided to take a "trouble-shooting" by utilizing the htop tool...And the usage to memory has goes to the max..Or rather is up to 90% or so.
[07:17:56] <ayecee> dfcnvt: what is it normally

[07:19:23] <ayecee> it's worse than useless, because it makes you think you've found the problem because it's a high number.
[07:19:53] <dfcnvt> If I'm right -- the status for the memory in the htop basically describe what is concurrently using the memory -- as we speak -- and that's too much memory is currently too busy -- and hence the interpretation for me to see that it is due to hogging the memory -- not sharing memory smoothly.

[07:24:14] <ayecee> these are not pieces of the system that consume significant resources.
[07:24:28] <dfcnvt> I suppose, I should take a picture now -- (the cpu & memory in htop) and have it restarted my computer -- then resume back on htop -- take another picture, then go by comparing if it's any correct.  And if I am not experiencing any issues with my supposition whether it's a memory hog or not, just issues and problem is obvious on my computer.  And...if it ever come back again, i can just take a look again in

[09:44:58] <Duchess> mikebutash_, okay sounds good thanks for the heads up.  Pretty wild working of this Curved monitor.  The font and icons are really small.  If I increase the size 200% in gnome all the screens increase on size. Is it possible just to change the Sumsung monitor text and icon size?

[11:26:15] <tirnanog> bencc1: probably not. still, it's good to know the underlying mechanics.
[11:26:20] <bencc1> I'm running a task in a docker container and it takes 0.7 of single cpu core
[11:26:43] <bencc1> but when I run 4 containers with the same task it takes 4 x 1.5 core instead of 4 x 0.7 core
[11:26:59] <tirnanog> as for logging, I'm afraid that the standard kernel doesn't log resource oversteps. generally, you'd expect individual applications to report errors in response to the inability to open any new file descriptors.
[11:27:08] <tirnanog> so there's no one single answer.
[11:27:17] <bencc1> the server has 32 cores, 128GB, fast nvme drive and 1Gbps so it's a software bottleneck and not a hardware limit

[12:51:16] <otisolsen70> When I try to mount an NFS share, I get this error: "mount.nfs: requested NFS version or transport protocol is not supported ". On the server, nothing is in the logs. The share is defined like this in fstab: "server:/data/video /net/video nfs nfsvers=3,timeo=60,intr,rsize=16384,wsize=16384,noauto,user 0 0"
[12:51:54] <otisolsen70> This share can be mounted just fine from other machines on the LAN. Only this one client seems to fail. The server and the other clients are debian 10. This one client that fails is debian 11. And this is the only debian 11 client. So I guess something must have happened to NFS between those versions?

[17:19:49] <Helenah> msiism, I've recently implemented a filesystem into my cli BBS.
[17:19:55] <xx> patching it is the only way of configuring it, that definitely "sucks less" than having an options file

[22:18:15] <superkuh> Hi. My ~/.xsession-errors ballooned to 120 GB for a stupid reason. I caught it before my disk filled. I then, stupidly, deleted it will the filehandle was still open instead of clearing it with > ~/.xsession-errors. Anyway, something happened. ncdu and other disk scan utilities report the file is gone and I have free space. But df -h reports that that 120 GB file is still filling things up and I have 1.3 GB left. Do I have to restart the X process to get
[22:18:15] <superkuh>  it to let go of that filehandle in or something?

[23:57:38] <u0_a2831> Hi
[23:57:39] <Common-Lisp> tirnanog: why would $0 having been subject to pathname expansion matter to my script?
[23:57:44] <Common-Lisp> Wouldn't $0 in that case be the expanded form?

[23:58:00] <tirnanog> Common-Lisp: because then you would have no idea what you end up executing.

[23:58:46] <tirnanog> also, the zeroeth argument is always technically under the control of the parent process. that's part of the problem. there is a lot more information on this topic in faq 28.
[23:59:01] <uwharrie> $0 would have been expanded before exec was called on it

[23:59:43] <Common-Lisp> tirnanog: right, the process can always be renamed etc., but usually won't be, and it's ok if that fails sometimes. I still think it's worthwhile to include this logic if it won't fail all the time.
