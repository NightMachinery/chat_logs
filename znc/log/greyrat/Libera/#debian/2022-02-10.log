[00:29:10] <somiaj> and you are running this as the user that is running kde (haven't su'd to some other user)
[00:29:27] <invra> from what i have notused is that gtk apps that require root priviledges will work. example synaptic will open with the popup prompt. thing is that the prompt for gtk apps is using PolicyKit1  while plasma apps im guessing are using kdesu
[00:29:49] <invra> somiaj: no, jsut a normal X session on the only user i got
[00:30:34] <somiaj> https://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?p=707978 I did find that
[00:31:38] <somiaj> though seems the best suggestion I see is, "First of all, it is highly recommended not to use kdesu or kdesudo to run graphical applications as root or with administrative privelages."
[00:31:45] <somiaj> have you tried kdesudo instead of kdesu?
[00:32:09] <invra> no i havent. this is jsut what was automatically pulled when i installed the desktop enviroment
[00:33:06] <somiaj> what program are you trying to run as root?
[00:33:45] <invra> its in the screenshot, ksystemlog
[00:34:39] <somiaj> for logs it is probably better to give some group the ability to read logs you want to be read by your normal user
[00:35:14] <somiaj> anyways, others might hvae better advise on this than me. I don't use desktops (only window managers) and don't run anything grpahical as root, if I wanted to read a log I would use grep/less/etc from a terminal
[00:35:32] <somiaj> Though that forum post might be releveant. It was for buster, but the same maybe true in bullseye
[00:36:21] <somiaj> there is a debian kde channel on irc.oftc.net, might be able to talk to other kde users about what is best policy over there.
[00:37:54] <invra> somiaj: what is the channel name?
[00:38:05] <somiaj> !debian irc
[00:38:05] <dpkg> The offical Debian IRC network is OFTC (irc.oftc.net). Please connect to OFTC for debian support and development communities. See https://wiki.debian.org/IRC for a list of channels. See also <oftc>, <oftc move>, and <libera>.

[01:41:10] <cosimone> try something like apt-mark showmanual | grep mate

[02:33:46] <greycat> I don't know if there *is* one any more.  There used to be, some fundamental lib.
[02:33:50] <greycat> !remove gnome
[02:33:50] <dpkg> To remove or purge GNOME 2.x: aptitude remove ~nlibgnome ~nlibbonobo2 ~nliborbit2 ~nlibgnomeui ~nlibgnomevfs2.  Use 'purge' instead of 'remove' if that's what you want (ask me about <purge>).
[02:34:02] <greycat> That's an old factoid.  GNOME 2.
[02:34:42] <Tangent-Man> To be honest I am not completely adverse to just leaving it on my system...
[02:34:57] <greycat> The way people recommend it nowadays is to remove the high-level package (task-gnome or whatever) and then let "autoremove" prune the no-longer-dependent packages.  This relies on autoremove being sane.
[02:35:22] <Tangent-Man> Hmmm...

[12:25:52] <hegemoOn> thank you

[15:49:04] <jelly> gurkenglas, ^

[16:14:55] <jelly> gurkenglas, don't expect there's a single tool to answer your question of the day.  The skill lies in mixing everything that's in the toolbox
[16:15:51] <gurkenglas> I agree that the tools should be not problem-specific! But a tool that, like, follows a piece of data around my computer as programs react to it sounds like it would be useful for a lot of things.

[21:42:14] <sney> the zpool command is in that package. you need to have /sbin in your path in order to use it.
[21:42:19] <sney> !buster su
[21:42:19] <dpkg> Starting with buster, su no longer overrides PATH by default, requiring that you use "su -" or "su -l" for login shells (which is not really a new thing at all...). See https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster#Changes for details.
