[15:14:34] <flatcap> morning all
[15:19:00] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[15:19:38] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[15:20:02] <dcpurton> hi
[15:20:33] <flatcap> hi dcpurton 
[15:20:56] <gahr> hi dcpurton 
[15:21:44] <flatcap> dcpurton: don't worry, alias/query is top of my list (after cornflakes)
[15:22:07] <dcpurton> :) no more bugs for you today
[15:22:17] <flatcap> :-)
[15:22:42] <flatcap> gahr: #3299 is the last big thing I wanted to get in before we talked about the R-word
[15:22:43] <neo-bot> PR by @flatcap "Eliminate menu_loop()": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/3299
[15:23:21] <flatcap> that should fix all/most of any lingering repainting problems
[15:23:40] <flatcap> (or at least leave them with simple(r) solutions :-)
[15:30:41] <flatcap> dcpurton: I fixed the <query>...<mail> losing its addresses, but the workflow wasn't quite the same between alias/query completion/direct
[15:30:43] <flatcap> https://github.com/neomutt/gfx/tree/main/arch#alias--query---dialog--completion
[15:33:48] <dcpurton> oh ah
[15:34:48] <flatcap> some routes, after selection, you drop back to the `To:` prompt, others don't
[15:35:50] <flatcap> also...  if you go to the Alias/Query dialog *directly* (not auto-completion), what should happen after you run <mail>?
[15:35:53] <dcpurton> do you care that `complete.gv` doesn't have an abort line for a blank subject like `direct.gv` does?
[15:36:19] <flatcap> should you *return* to the selection, or drop back to the index?
[15:36:35] * flatcap looks carefully...
[15:37:51] <flatcap> you're right, there should be an abort from "Subject:"
[15:38:36] <dcpurton> If you <query>example<enter><select-entry> it should put what you select into the To: field
[15:39:12] <flatcap> yes, I think so too
[15:39:15] <dcpurton> Going straight to Subject: would annoy me in case I wanted to alter anything at that point
[15:39:44] <dcpurton> This is what current behaviour is
[15:40:05] <flatcap> I was playing with upstream mutt last night, but that's a little inconsistent (who'd a thought it?)
[15:41:28] <dcpurton> I confess I don't use aliases. All my addresses are looked up used lbdbq linked to a variety of backends
[15:41:47] <flatcap> and after we've mailed from the Query Dialog?
[15:41:54] <flatcap> Back there (user might want to do more)
[15:42:11] <flatcap> or back to the Index (the user's done what they wanted to do)?
[15:42:36] <flatcap> I (slightly) prefer the back-to-index
[15:42:50] <flatcap> it's more similar to the auto-completion case
[15:43:13] <flatcap> (one I fix the 'To:' prompt)
[15:43:17] <dcpurton> Yes, once you've sent the mail it should back to the index. I would never want to return to looking up at addresses
[15:43:43] <flatcap> yeah, good
[15:44:09] <dcpurton> I like your diagrams except I'd like to see the To: prompt in `direct.gv`
[15:44:27] <flatcap> thanks.  yep, I'll fix that
[15:44:44] <flatcap> they were pretty helpful in understanding too
[16:00:13] <gahr> flatcap: yup 3299 is scary
[16:00:19] <gahr> do you need a thorough review? :)
[16:02:00] <flatcap> hehe, it's *not* quite as big and crazy as it seems
[16:02:46] <gahr> yeah I think you did an eccellent job with those self-contained commits!
[16:03:06] <gahr> did it just happen or did you re-arrange them after the fact?
[16:03:07] <flatcap> thanks.  that took me half of the development time :-)
[16:03:15] <gahr> question answered.
[16:03:19] <flatcap> it was a LOT of post-processing
[16:03:32] *** Quits: kzak_ (~kzak@nat-37.starnet.cz) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[16:04:15] <flatcap> if you're happy with what I've done with one of the simple dialogs
[16:04:51] <flatcap> then I can spare your the Menu/dialog changes -- they only happen in one case: certificate verification
[16:05:03] <flatcap> you could check _that_ works too
[16:05:27] <flatcap> really, I just need people to start looking for any visual "quirks"
[16:05:43] <flatcap> not painting, when it should
[16:05:54] <gahr> yup building the branch now
[16:05:56] <flatcap> visible cursor, when it shouldn't be
[16:05:58] <flatcap> thanks
[16:07:05] <flatcap> now, pretty much *all* the repainting starts at the *one* call to `window_repaint()` in the dialog's event loop
[16:07:42] <gahr> yeah the general event loop refactoring is good
[16:07:50] <gahr> you showed that to me a few days ago
[16:07:58] <flatcap> thanks!  I'm really pleased with it
[16:08:59] <flatcap> and I've managed to remove the "dialog" lines from `struct Menu` -- they've bugged me for years
[16:09:02] * flatcap shudders

[16:09:37] <gahr> :)
[16:13:22] <gahr> I think tag-compose in the query browser doesn't work
[16:13:36] <gahr> i query for "fr", tag two entries, tag-prefix compose
[16:13:51] <gahr> the To confirmation line says fr, <second tagged entry>
[16:14:02] <gahr> instead of <first..>, <second..>
[16:14:37] <gahr> let me double check master
[16:14:52] <flatcap> ah yes, 23b03a69f in master fixes that
[16:15:26] <gahr> not in your branch?
[16:17:17] <flatcap> that fix came after I'd made the PR
[16:17:51] <gahr> ok
[16:18:43] <gahr> weird
[16:18:47] <flatcap> oh, I'm wrong.  it IS in the branch
[16:19:11] <gahr> yeah
[16:20:00] *** Quits: bitigchi1 (~bitigchi@user/bitigchi) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[16:21:55] <gahr> you don't account for menu->tag_prefix
[16:22:09] <flatcap> ok, thanks
[16:22:23] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/23b03a69f7c4131cf603af105a389a9173b5272f/alias/dlg_query.c#L424
[16:22:28] <gahr> weird, it's there, but commented
[16:22:56] <flatcap> hmm...
[16:22:59] <flatcap> thanks
[16:23:25] <gahr> from ecdd541194295f2a15ef87d2684e717c06791610
[16:23:28] <gahr> interesting
[16:24:29] <dcpurton> I don't think that's fixed in master
[16:24:40] <flatcap> I wonder if I've messed up a rebase
[16:25:54] <dcpurton> oh - yest it is. It's the <complete-query> path that isn't fixed
[16:28:58] <gahr> it's not fixed in master
[16:29:09] <gahr> if you tag entries in the query then tag-prefix compose
[16:29:32] <gahr> it's fixed if you don't tag
[16:30:51] <flatcap> ok, thanks
[16:31:11] <gahr> I think I'd reset it once and for all inside if (retbuf)
[16:31:11] <dcpurton> Isn't this just the various combinations covered in #3300
[16:31:11] <neo-bot> Issue by @dcpurton "Various <query> and <complete-query> issues": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3300
[16:31:28] <gahr> oh I haven't read that sorry
[16:31:29] <gahr> let me double check
[16:31:53] <gahr> yes, it's your first failure
[16:31:57] <gahr> F6
[16:32:12] <gahr> s/first/third/
[16:32:42] <dcpurton> all those failures still occur in master
[16:33:07] <dcpurton> <F5> also was broken, but that was fixed
[16:33:22] <gahr> I think F4 and F6 are the same bug
[16:34:33] <dcpurton> probably
[16:34:52] <gahr> it's just a different number of tagged entries?
[16:35:01] <gahr> or what's the difference between the two?
[16:35:24] <gahr> yeah 1 vs 3 tagged addresses
[16:35:50] <gahr> flatcap: do you want me to push the patch or you're on it?
[16:36:21] <flatcap> I'm on it.  I need to re-arrange the workflow for the two dialogs

[17:45:23] <gahr> wow I just got an IMAP-related crash on master.. hadn't happened in a while
[17:46:03] <flatcap> damn!  any thoughts to the cause?
[17:46:51] <gahr> we go over the heap allocated by mx_alloc_memory doing qresync
[17:48:40] <flatcap> oh
[17:49:56] <gahr> this has happened in the past
[17:50:15] <flatcap> there are 9 upstream qresync/imap patches that I started looking at [flatcap/qresync]
[17:50:16] <gahr> somehow something happens and we either don't get the right number the first time, or I whatever
[17:52:09] <flatcap> hmm... that sounds a bit vague :-)
[17:53:12] <gahr> :)
[17:53:32] <gahr> #3303
[17:53:32] <neo-bot> PR by @gahr "Make sure we have enough memory for a new email": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/3303
[17:54:18] <flatcap> hehe, fair enough
[17:54:46] <gahr> if only m->emails was an ARRAY :/
[17:55:03] <flatcap> soon!
[17:55:47] <flatcap> I'll leave that PR for a second (just in case you think of something different/better)
[17:58:42] <gahr> sure
[17:58:55] <gahr> so I would need to refresh my mind on that state machine
[17:59:18] <flatcap> ok
[17:59:29] <gahr> but what I think could happen is that we're sending FETCH commands and we're handling the responses
[17:59:41] <gahr> we expect a number of responses, but we might get spurious EXISTS or something
[17:59:48] <gahr> and that might screw up our state
[17:59:56] <flatcap> ah ok
[18:00:05] <gahr> so we end up iterating over more emails than we pre-computed
[18:03:09] *** Quits: qyliss (~qyliss@2001-ba8-1f1-f0bc-0-0-0-2.autov6rev.bitfolk.space) (Quit: bye)
[18:03:36] <gahr> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501#section-7.4.2
[18:03:40] <gahr> This response occurs as the result of a FETCH or STORE command, as well as by unilateral server decision (e.g., flag updates).
[18:04:11] <gahr> so if we get an unsolicited FETCH response while (or before) the list we expect, we'll probably screw things up

[18:06:39] <gahr> but it's a speculation
[18:06:56] <gahr> I'd really need to rewri^H^H^Had that code
[18:07:24] <flatcap> :-)
[18:08:21] <gahr> there's a poor man attemp to a check 
[18:08:21] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/4806c12014edddbc877e17e24962284aeabb8dbd/imap/message.c#L1188
[18:08:39] <gahr> so it means the situation is realistic
[18:09:07] <flatcap> I see
[18:09:20] *** Joins: qyliss (~qyliss@atuin.qyliss.net)
[18:09:23] <gahr> but that only checks for messages out of range
[18:09:38] <gahr> when we're evaluating the header cache, we might have holes
[18:09:59] <gahr> so if I ask for [1:10, 15:20] I probably pre-allocated 15 emails
[18:10:13] <gahr> if I get an unsolicited FETCH response for msg 12, foobar happens
[18:10:14] <flatcap> eek
[18:10:31] <gahr> I should stop speculating and read the code some more.

[19:35:44] <immae> Hello! How do we know which keybindings we should set for special keystrokes? I’m trying to assign shift+right, and when I run "read" it says "^[[1;2C". But when I set "bind index \e[1\;2C" in the neomuttrc file it says "key is not bound" (but I can see the definition in the binding list)
[19:37:30] <flatcap> try <s-right> in your config
[19:37:58] <flatcap> you can run   :exec what-key   to see what names neomutt expects for which keys
[19:38:14] <immae> Ah nice
[19:38:16] <immae> Thanks!
