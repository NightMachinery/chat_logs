[00:42:58] <Agiofws> is there a way to display or parse  curl output to html ?
[00:43:51] <__adrian> like anything else, decide what info you want to display, and then make html templates

[00:47:35] <Agiofws> i'm trying to connect to an oauth2 server through an oauth2 client  or imitating one through successfull curl comands via linux terminal and i  with post and get  methods i get succesfull tokens and bearer from which i can get  a users info.(goal)  my obstical here is that i don't know how to implement his through a browser
[00:48:10] <__adrian> browser? or do you mean, a php script?
[00:49:04] <Agiofws> i have found this generic client  https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/ but i don't even know how to set it up or use it...
[00:49:27] <Agiofws> if a php script can do it i'd go that way...
[00:49:49] <__adrian> that's a php library, so no, you can't use it in a browser.
[00:50:00] <__adrian> how much do oyu know about (a) php (b) how oath works?
[00:50:31] <Agiofws> i know the theory o oauth but php zero ...
[00:50:44] <__adrian> then you're going to need to learn a bit about that first
[00:50:56] <Agiofws> for example how do you use a library ? through php ?
[00:51:21] <__adrian> for example, php runs on your server, not in the user's browser. do you _need_ something that works in the browser?
[00:51:30] <Agiofws> you call the library's functions?
[00:51:47] <__adrian> that's not the first thing to learn/worry about
[00:51:52] <__adrian> do you _need_ something that works in the browser?
[00:51:54] <Agiofws> no php lives on my lamp server
[00:52:46] <da_wunder> hmm, isn't lamp === Linux Apache MySql PHP
[00:52:58] <Agiofws> yes thats  it
[00:56:01] <Agiofws> i have a wordpress site and i would like users to oauth2 (authenticate) to a generic oauth2 server which will redirect them to certain url of my site.  but after  that  i need to display the users info through a post and get method which i can do with curl via terminal i just need to do the same thin through php? to produce the html?
[00:56:24] <__adrian> ok, so that's important context.
[00:56:40] <__adrian> you're wanting to us eoauth with wordpress - so you need to be looking for a wordpress plugin.
[00:57:40] <Agiofws> eoauth?
[00:57:57] <__adrian> s/ e/e /
[00:58:28] <__adrian> google gives a few likely results, but i'd ask on a wordpress-focused channel/forum.
[00:58:51] <da_wunder> ^
[00:59:14] <Agiofws> i've searched for plugins  but all of them have a static redirect URL that i can't change in the plugin so that won't work
[00:59:47] <Agiofws> only payed version will allow me to change the redirect url
[00:59:50] <__adrian> that seems unlikely, but i wouldn't know. you should ask on a wp-focused channel/forum (this is not a wp-focused channel)
[01:00:34] <da_wunder> and if you need that and some paid version gives you that, then just buy it - if you really need that
[01:00:58] <Agiofws> i'm not asking how to get this done in wordpress  if i know how to get this done on a simple apache html page i will learn how to do it in wordpress
[01:01:32] <Agiofws> wouldn't pay 300E for something so simple
[01:02:50] <Agiofws> any tips on how to user curl php and display a page ?
[01:03:09] <da_wunder> imho - 300€ is really little - that is just like ~1-3 hour worktime that you get with that
[01:03:10] <__adrian> i wouldn't pay that either, but realize that, starting from zero, you're going to be investing a ton more than 300€ figuring out how to do it.
[01:03:50] <da_wunder> ^
[01:04:02] <__adrian> (a) "how do i show curl on a webpage" doesn't make sense, that's got nothing to do with what you want to accomplish.
[01:04:03] <Agiofws> investing on knowledge...
[01:04:06] <da_wunder> and most likely you don't cover all the corner cases
[01:04:15] <__adrian> (b) php has curl functions.  https://php.net/curl
[01:04:25] <Agiofws> i know it does
[01:04:32] <__adrian> (c) you need to learn how to wirth php code _first_, before either of these things.
[01:04:46] <Agiofws> if i can get some examples maybe i can get it right
[01:05:01] <__adrian> (d) after that, you're going to need to learn how to write code for wordpress, which is a whole other thing.
[01:05:48] <Agiofws> ok simple curl functions to  get  json files and display that in html ...
[01:05:51] <__adrian> to be clear, this is a few weeks of work at a minimum, IF it turns out you're well-suited to programming. it's not something that can be explained in a few minutes over IRC.
[01:05:58] <da_wunder> and after that all, you should realize that 300€ is not so much...
[01:06:12] <Agiofws> it is for me
[01:06:20] <__adrian> if you want to go this route, that's cool, and sure, you can get help with questions that come up.
[01:06:33] <__adrian> but you're not going to be hitting that big question for quite a while.
[01:06:34] <Agiofws> ok
[01:07:09] <__adrian> first, you need to look at the language itself. learn how to read php.net. learn about syntax, control structures, and so forth.
[01:07:12] <da_wunder> so you're not calculating your own work costs at all?
[01:07:16] <__adrian> do you already understand html?
[01:08:15] <Agiofws> can  you store things like  clientid , redirecturl, scope, code,  etc... in a file and call those strings through php to insert the parameters in url through curl ?

[01:09:18] *** Joins: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@pop.92-184-105-97.mobile.abo.orange.fr)
[01:09:23] <da_wunder> and also I would ask question - do you real need that oauth at all? - specially if you cannot afford to buy some plugin to handle that for you
[01:09:27] <__adrian> if you already know the curl (cli) command you want to use, then converting it to php is fairly straightforward.  IF you know how to write php code. you're still jumping too far ahead.
[01:09:46] <__adrian> https://php.net/manual/langref  ← recommend starting here.
[01:09:53] <__adrian> do you already understand html?
[01:10:17] <Agiofws> a bit
[01:10:44] <__adrian> you're going to need to know html at least well enough to write the html markup you want to use to display your results.
[01:11:04] *** wyre_ is now known as wyre
[01:11:06] <Agiofws> there is a plugin that does what i want but it seems it jumps to far ahead
[01:11:53] <__adrian> the advantage of a plugin is that someone else already did the programming work (and if you find a well-reviewed and well-used plugin, hopefully it's done well)
[01:12:10] <Agiofws> https://wordpress.org/plugins/gsislogin/#description
[01:12:14] <da_wunder> so create an issue to that plugin repository where you explain your issue
[01:12:16] <__adrian> in many cases, using a wp plugin doesn't touch code at all.
[01:13:22] <Agiofws> it connects exactly to the provider but the instructions assume things i don't know how to implement
[01:13:57] <__adrian> you should ask the plugin author, then, or see if they have a support channel or community.
[01:14:19] <__adrian> these are questions we casnnot answer here. this is not a wordpress-focused channel.
[01:14:28] <Agiofws> i understand
[01:16:10] <Agiofws> you think i should'nt re invent the wheel again?
[01:16:26] <__adrian> generally speaking, you should not reinvent wheels
[01:16:51] <da_wunder> specially if you're not familiar with php
[01:16:54] <__adrian> if you want to learn, and use this as an opportunity to learn, cool. but realize that's *NOT* a fast path. it's a very slow path.
[01:17:07] <da_wunder> ^
[01:17:15] <__adrian> ...a path which would likely start with learning how to use existing solutions
[01:17:33] <Agiofws> so even if i can get this done in php.  another obstical will be how to set this up in wordpress?
[01:17:55] <da_wunder> and then compare again that 300€ bill for your own time - and really you should calculate what _your_ time really cost
[01:18:01] <__adrian> to clarify: wordpress is a content management system, not a programming language. it's written in php.
[01:18:27] <__adrian> but yes, integrating into WP will be yet another huge thing to undertake.
[01:18:32] <da_wunder> for that 300€ you should literally just get something like 0.8-3h
[01:18:52] <Agiofws> i'm not getting paid to do this
[01:19:00] <__adrian> i'd be very surprised if there's not something readily available, decently good, that's frfee.
[01:19:03] <__adrian> *free
[01:19:16] <Agiofws> its done on my free time to help get theings done faster in work

[01:21:41] <__adrian> yeah, sorry. that ^
[01:21:55] <da_wunder> and really if your employer cannot understand that, then I would recommend you to change job

[01:22:12] <__adrian> about exactly what you're doing
[01:23:04] <Agiofws> yeah but i can't afford to change a job i just want to make things at work better for everyone
[01:23:22] <__adrian> ok - so seems da_wunder got it right  :/
[01:23:35] <__adrian> your job wants you to spend your own money on a work project??
[01:23:55] <da_wunder> that is fucking BIG red sign
[01:24:23] <__adrian> before anyone piles on, Agiofws, is that what you mean?
[01:24:36] <Agiofws> no it doesn't  but it won't spend money on a web dev either
[01:25:12] <Agiofws> it can't or won't
[01:25:13] <__adrian> well, if they don't want to invest in it, they're not going to get a good result
[01:25:24] <__adrian> that's not a problem for _you_ to solve
[01:25:30] <da_wunder> ^
[01:26:17] <Agiofws> but  it elevate the enviroment and get things done faster if users authenicate
[01:26:17] <da_wunder> and if your company is saying that is _your_ problem - then sadly - you're in hostile company - and I would recommend you to leave that place
[01:26:36] <Agiofws> its not  private sector
[01:27:01] <da_wunder> it doesn't matter if that is private or public sector
[01:27:08] <__adrian> Agiofws: i'm not saying it would be a bad idea to make it better. i'm saying they should invest in making it better, and that if they won't, then it's their own self-imposed problem, and NOT something for _you_ to solve.

[01:31:51] <__adrian> so, considering everything, i'd suggest going with finding a plugin and learning how to use it. from there, you can start learning more about php (and programming) in general, if that interests you.
[01:31:52] <da_wunder> in that case you really should start the talk at your work about that issue and get some answers from product owner(s) and actual users
[01:32:19] <Agiofws> i think i'll send the plugin dev. a meesage tomorrow seams to install in wp. just go to know how to use the plugin to talk to the auth2 server

[17:32:49] <AllenJB> The second I would file a bug for, but it'll probably get closed because there's a stupidly obscure page in the manual somewhere that basically says "any function can return false for 'reasons'"

[17:47:39] <krux02> sorry, I am really new to php, I am just learning it. How do I import a module?
[17:48:04] <Naktibalda> krux02: what is a module?
[17:48:58] <krux02> like a package, some form of container that has php functionality that is not built in
[17:49:09] <Naktibalda> have you read about composer?
[17:49:23] <krux02> no, I didn't
[17:49:59] <Naktibalda> krux02: in the old days you had to require files containing classes and functions, since PHP 5.0, files are automatically loaded then non-existing class is used.
[17:50:07] <Naktibalda> this feature is called autoloading
[17:50:46] <Naktibalda> so you don't have to import anything, but you can use  `use statements` to create shorter aliases for namespaced class names;
[17:51:03] <krux02> I have a set of autogenerated protobuf files, and I would like to use them to parse a protobuf message
[17:51:12] <krux02> that is my quest for now
[17:51:46] <krux02> So when everything is in the same directory it is 'autoimported'?
[17:51:59] <Naktibalda> composer is a tool used to install libraries, and it provides autoloading, so nobody is writing their own autoloaders anymore
[17:52:10] <Naktibalda> no, it isn't
[17:52:10] <krux02> and when it is in a subdirectory? Does this introduce implicitly a name in php?
[17:52:51] <krux02> well these protobuf files are not an external package, I just generated them
[17:52:55] <Naktibalda> with composer autoloader, you can specify that some namespace is in specific directory: https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload
[17:54:26] <krux02> now I see json

[17:55:35] <krux02> scala, Java, C++, Rust, Nim, haskell
[17:55:36] <__adrian> krux02: php does _absolutely nothing like_ "importing."
[17:55:46] <krux02> emacs lisp
[17:56:15] <krux02> bash, fish, prolog
[17:56:29] <Naktibalda> krux02: you could start by reading https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php
[17:56:54] <Naktibalda> and https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
[17:57:02] *** Joins: systemovich (~User@197-99-67-4.ip.broadband.is)
[17:57:03] <__adrian> `use` makes an alias for a classname. "autoloading" is what happens when you use a classname for a class that hasn't been defined yet; php will use your autoloading functions to try to load the class definition. as Naktibalda says, composer's autoloader is the go-to these days.
[17:58:06] <krux02> so in other words I could also just include everything and there is no downside of it (except code maintainability)
[17:58:08] <__adrian> also note there's no such thing as a "module" as you might expect from other languages. classes can be namespaced, but that only affects the classname (it doesn't create any kind of modular structure)
[17:58:15] <stutz> krux02: cool, I couldn't follow Naktibalda neither but the thing is php does not do any of that stuff automagically like java. if a class is not found PHP crashes but now you can just unless you either manually loaded the class file or tell php how to find that file (thats the autoloading part)
[17:58:22] <Naktibalda> yes, you could require_once all files
[17:58:24] <__adrian> there's the downside of loading a bunch of junk you don't need
[17:58:56] <krux02> __adrian, yea
[17:59:15] <krux02> in go, importing modules that are not used is a straight up compiler error
[17:59:19] <krux02> that is annoying as well
[17:59:22] <stutz> there is a standard used in the php community (https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) for autoloading files and composer (depedency manager for php) can generate / handle psr-4 autoloadings by defining autoload on the composer.json
[18:00:03] <krux02> just a question as I come from the lisp world, does php have some form of metaprogramming?
[18:00:07] <stutz> krux02: the fact that go won't compile if it finds unused code is one of its good features :D
[18:00:48] <__adrian> krux02: there are https://php.net/attributes but that may or may not be what you're looking for
[18:00:53] <krux02> stutz, I agree that it should be a warning, but a compile error is really annoying especially if you uncomment some debug print message and then compile error because you didn't used fmt anymore
[18:01:33] <__adrian> if it's not what you want, then the answer is probably "no"
[18:01:36] <krux02> but generally yes, unused imports should be detected and removed. In C++ that also uses #include is is pretty much impossible to detect unused includes
[18:02:00] <skyroveRR> Hey guys, I'm working on a hobby point-of-sale project for vehicle spares. I've got zero knowledge of javascript and XML and stuff, and on top of that, I felt a little comfortable when it was mentioned on hashphp.org that noscript is becoming increasingly popular, so any progress made in terms of learning javascript/jquery/ajax stuff is more or less going to be a little futile. Basically I don't have to learn
[18:02:02] <skyroveRR> something that's probably going to be blocked in the future. Of course, feel free to correct me, folks. Anyway, coming back to the vehicle spares POS hobby project of mine, would it be prudent to write a bulk order page in PHP? I can't seem to find an appropriate example on the net that does not utilise javascript. I've already made a single-product sales page, but I'm hoping someone in here would provide a
[18:02:04] <skyroveRR> tangible idea for writing a bulk sales per order page in PHP without javascript/ajax. Like, multiple items per order, how the page could possibly look like, that kind of stuff.
[18:02:06] <stutz> use println() then instead of fmt.Println, problem solved. also your editor should automatically import/remove import things used
[18:02:32] <stutz> go aside though. read up on PSR-4 Autoloading and the composer settings and you should be good to go!
[18:02:57] <krux02> __adrian, tagging types with information is one part of metaprogramming
[18:02:58] *** Joins: Akimb (~Akimb@82-135-197-171.static.zebra.lt)
[18:03:08] <krux02> the other part is using that information to generate code
[18:03:21] <krux02> (or to refactor existing code)
[18:03:47] <krux02> stutz, thanks
[18:05:21] <__adrian> yep, "nope" to the second part.
[18:05:29] <Naktibalda> skyroveRR: it is a crazy idea that javascript will be blocked in the future
[18:05:56] <__adrian> many IDEs provide varying amounts of generation/refactoring stuff
[18:06:31] <Naktibalda> "increasingly popular" probably means that a number if users doubled to 2
[18:06:32] <skyroveRR> Naktibalda: "Be aware that JavaScript can and will be disabled, and that AJAX is therefore an extension, not a baseline. Even if most normal users leave it on now, remember that NoScript is becoming more popular, mobile devices may not work as expected, and Google won't run most of your JavaScript when indexing the site" <- http://hashphp.org/
[18:06:47] <__adrian> "it was mentioned on hashphp.org that noscript is becoming increasingly popular"  that's ...old, and did not turn out to be a real thing
[18:06:55] <hans> skyroveRR: for webdev you absolutely should learn javascript, it's not going away, and only nerds use noscript, it's probably a small part of your target audience
[18:07:10] <stutz> wtf is hashphp and why do you think they are correcrt skyroveRR ?
[18:07:34] <skyroveRR> stutz: check it out for yourself.
[18:07:48] <stutz> I don't want to unless there is a real reason why I should.
[18:07:59] <krux02> Naktibalda, where will javascript be blocked in the future?
[18:08:18] <stutz> point is, js is not going away and without it half the internet is unusable so yeah - the site is wrong :D
[18:08:18] <Naktibalda> krux02: nowehere. read what skyroveRR wrote
[18:08:56] <stutz> though I would go as far as saying there might be no real reason to pick up jquery in 2021 given the modern js tool/frameworks
[18:09:00] <Naktibalda> that statement is probably 15 years old
[18:09:43] <hans> $=document.querySelectorAll.bind(document);
[18:09:48] <krux02> when the problem is, that people disable js and you need it to analyze them, make everything rely on js, then they can't disable it.
[18:10:27] <skyroveRR> hans: Naktibalda: __adrian: well ok so javascript is not going away. Still, is writing a bulk sales script more ok in javascript or in plain PHP + HTML where a cashier logs in, clicks "New order", and takes orders in a one item per page fashion before finally clicking on "Conclude order" when javascript isn't involved?
[18:10:34] <hans> krux02: counterpoint: people *dont* disable javascript. its extremely rare
[18:10:36] <krux02> make the website an empty html document that loads its actual content through javascript, then nobody can use noscript. (performace will be ass, but who cares)
[18:11:05] <stutz> don't use it if you don't need it skyroveRR - its that simple
[18:11:06] <krux02> hans, I did use noscript for a while, but the web becomes more and more useless
[18:11:26] <krux02> with javascript it is still shit, but at least usable
[18:11:28] <stutz> https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/
[18:11:45] <skyroveRR> stutz: yeah I know that site.
[18:12:33] <skyroveRR> stutz: then there's "better" mofo website. Last I checked, there were about five more websites, each actually being even more shittier in looks than the previous one.
[18:12:33] <krux02> stutz, yea I totally agree
[18:13:18] <krux02> I think the worst incarnation of garbage websites are all "single page application" websites
[18:13:43] <krux02> it does everything from the toolbox that breaks responsiveness and usability.
[18:13:54] <stutz> yeah well the thing is, as a php developer I really don't care about that stuff. I provide an API and let the frontend peeps do the rest :shrugs:
[18:14:42] <krux02> the only good thing about websites that don't actually contain the content but have scripts that load them is, you can use it to block ads.

[19:02:59] <krux02> Naktibalda, ?
[19:03:27] <Naktibalda> instead of using 20 require statements
[19:03:32] <krux02> you speak a language that I don't understand
[19:03:41] <Naktibalda> read about autoloading and composer :)
[19:03:52] <krux02> the 20 require statements where easy to generate
[19:04:42] <Naktibalda> anyway, it is 20 require statements too much

[19:05:19] <krux02> that is the language I understand
[19:08:07] <krux02> Naktibalda, in oder to speak to mea, you have to define first what, 'namespace' is in php and what 'autoload rule' in composer.json is
[19:10:28] <krux02> Naktibalda, do you know how to specify a namespace in protoc?
[19:11:38] <AllenJB> In PHP namespaces allow libraries (or even domains / bounding contexts within a single application) to not worry about class name collisions. They're basically a "prefix" on the class name.

[22:32:39] <Albright> I think some documentation is using their own client library and some isn't… some of the code samples introduce variables out of nowhere without explaining what they are instances of…
[22:32:51] <Albright> Well, I've already got it working for Apple Wallet. That was relatively easy.
[22:33:37] <judah> I once had to explain to a Google engineer that setting the value of a field that doesnt exist to null does not constitute a proper "work around." I shit you not. Best programmers in the world but scared of their own code.
[22:34:13] <relipse> why would you set a value that doesn't exist to null?

[22:37:44] <judah> Yeah. I escalated that within Google until I managed to get one of their senior developers on the project. We emailed back and forth and the end result was that they could see and reproduce the problem, but since they didnt really understand how the API generation worked they couldnt fix it
[22:38:12] <relipse> i'm trying to get away from google
[22:38:16] <Albright> Lol so their response is "please set this property manually to make our code work because we can't be assed to set a default value on an object property"?

[23:08:45] <Albright> Creepy ads is their entire business model.
[23:15:06] <noord> Albright: it is ads company, what would you expect?
[23:15:13] <NoiseEee> for now, until for $3.99/monthly you can search ad-free

[23:18:38] <judah> I have never once, not once ever, deliberately clicked on an ad. I have no idea what the business model is for advertising
[23:19:43] <judah> Even for ads on the radio. I have no intention of ever going into the local mattress store, but I do know that they interrupt my music a lot with their terrible ads. If I ever need a mattress I will go out of my way to get it from somewhere else that has less annoying ads
[23:19:59] <Albright> We are not normies. I swear by AdGuard and SponsorBlock.
[23:20:20] <Albright> But I do keep DDG unblocked and have clicked ads returned with their search results a few times.

[23:33:08] <CorvetteZR1> hello.  i have an issue after updating to php8.  the code is not mine and i'm not much of a programer, so not sure how to fix it.  this line is causing an error:
[23:33:10] <CorvetteZR1> $files = array_diff(scandir($dir), ['.','..']);
[23:33:46] <CorvetteZR1> the error is: PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught TypeError: array_diff(): Argument #1 ($array) must be of type array, bool given
[23:34:17] <CorvetteZR1> it was working in php7.4 prior to update (it was probably throwing a warning and needed to be addressed then, but again, not my code)
[23:34:34] <CorvetteZR1> anyway idea how to refactor this to make php8 happy?
[23:35:11] <AllenJB> I'd expect to also see a warning from scandir() as to why it failed (you may need to adjust error_reporting or set up log_errors / error_log)
[23:35:31] <Albright> CorvetteZR1: The call to scandir() is returning false because the directory can't be read. http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.scandir.php
[23:35:40] <CorvetteZR1> hmm, i may have seen something about scandir too, let me check
[23:35:59] <Albright> array_diff() can't operate on a bool, hence the array.
[23:36:49] <CorvetteZR1> right, there is a warning for this:       PHP Warning:  scandir(): (errno 20): Not a directory in
[23:36:53] *** Quits: ge (~g@37.214.43.102) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:36:58] <Albright> You should probably be doing something like `$files = scandir($dir); if ($files === false) { // error out here } $files = array_diff($files, …);`
[23:37:57] <CorvetteZR1> hmmm, ok, let me see if i can make sense of this.  thanks for the direction
[23:39:00] <Albright> Or have some other sort of code to assure $dir is both readable and a directory before trying to read it.
[23:39:59] <Albright> PHP is gradually becoming more serious about types, so I'm glad this has become a fatal error.
[23:40:31] <Albright> You may disagree given current circumstances. :)

[23:42:20] <CorvetteZR1> i don't disagree and this isn't super critical
[23:43:18] <CorvetteZR1> what's trippy though, this application has a 2 factor auth option.  for users who have 2fa disabled, it doesn't get this error and the function works.  for users who have 2fa enabled, it fails here with that error
[23:43:35] <CorvetteZR1> in terms of directories, they are the same for both types of users...
[23:49:00] <CorvetteZR1> hmmm, looks like there is something release serious messed up with session cookies and that may be tripping this
[23:51:14] <relipse> maybe you need to hire a php programmer CorvetteZR1
[23:51:42] <CorvetteZR1> relipse, naw, not for this.  it's my own project, i need to learn it myself...no revenue for this
[23:52:34] <CorvetteZR1> this particular function is not my code; i just copied it from somewhere some time ago.  the rest of the application is mine...and it's...well, amateur :P
[23:53:09] <CorvetteZR1> this session cookie thing is definitely on me and probably needs to be reworked
