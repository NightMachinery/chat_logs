[00:01:53] <kenran> Hey everyone, I'm having some problems: I'm on NixOS, and while the distributed version 2.2.3 of Nyxt runs, it crashes on site loading with the webkit sandbox issue, so I've exported the variable to set this to 0. But then loading something like https://www.google.de I just get a blank screen. I can see the title of the window being correct, as well as view-source, but just no "picture".
[00:02:24] <kenran> (With the bundled version 2.2.4 to download I don't seem to have this problem, but there I can't get the gstreamer stuff to work.)
[00:04:28] <kenran> So I've decided to build from source, entering the nix-shell and performing a `make` and it worked! But I'm running into the same issues with it being "blank" now :( any idea what this could be?
[00:05:22] <kenran> One thing to note: ./nyxt --version shows me 2.1.1-1823-g57ae8bc0, where the 2.1.1 looks strange, but the last part matches the latest git revision, so I guess that's just a tiny mismatch.

[13:35:21] <taiju> Hi,
[13:35:23] <taiju> I tried to read the release notes but it was a server error.

[19:18:44] <lagash> Or maybe we could create our own format! /s https://xkcd.com/927/
[19:20:44] <lagash> Also, prepare for a potential influx of Smalltalk users, lol
