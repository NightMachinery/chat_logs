[01:14:47] <GuiToris> I heard Americans substituting shall for should. Instead of 'shall we go' they just said 'should we go'
[01:15:23] <LjL> that would be "substituting should for shall", no? :P
[01:15:37] <LjL> anyway "should we go" is fine per se, but it has a different ring to "shall we go"
[01:15:50] <LjL> so i'm not sure i'd talk about substituting, rather of different nuances
[01:16:45] <GuiToris> I meant to say that, I didn't focus enough
[01:18:08] <GuiToris> in what sense do you use mustn't? when you are not allowed to do something? 'You mustn't pull that lever'?
[01:18:38] <StayHungry> GuiToris: look it up in the dictionary, no?
[01:18:54] <GuiToris> StayHungry, you mustn't talk to me like that!
[01:19:48] <LjL> i'd also use it in like "that mustn't be a very hard problem"... it kind of takes the emphasis away from the "not" so that it doesn't sound like i'm saying something "must not"
[01:20:12] <LjL> but, i said "i'd also use it", in reality i'd mostly not use it :P so maybe i'll shut up and leave the floor to someone who does use it
[01:20:54] <LjL> StayHungry, that's not a very nice reply... of course they can look it up in the dictionary but this is about nuances, not the obvious literal meaning of "must not" which i think GuiToris gets
[01:20:58] <GuiToris> that's the other meaning of 'must', I thought you wouldn't use in this sense
[01:21:07] <LjL> GuiToris, i might be wrong
[01:21:07] <StayHungry> LjL: modal verbs are essentials, not something that very different between dialects
[01:21:37] <GuiToris> LjL, no, you are right, I was curious about the usage, I know 'must'
[01:21:47] <GuiToris> StayHungry, wrong
[01:21:56] <LjL> well, since american dialects mostly wouldn't use the stated negatives, i'd say we're already past proving that untrue
[01:22:08] <GuiToris> StayHungry, British people don't say; He must not be rich!
[01:23:22] <StayHungry> LjL: 'in what sense do you use mustn't?' -> in the very same sense as everyone else
[01:23:58] <GuiToris> StayHungry, you didn't read what I wrote, did you

[01:26:18] <GuiToris> Dictionaries don't say if I should use the given word or I shouldn't
[01:28:01] <LjL> GuiToris, not finding much, but https://englishlive.ef.com/blog/language-lab/english-grammar-use-must-mustnt/ claims that something *similar* (but imo not quite identical) to my example is wrong wrong wrong, so maybe you're right, and i'm wrong. but it also says that in the negative form of such a statement you'd have to replace *mustn't with "couldn't" or such, but it doesn't address whether there's any context where "must not" makes sense but "mustn't" doesn't

[01:48:36] <StayHungry> GuiToris: it seems, being a foreigner, you find it difficult to formulate questions precisely. yesterday he asked me if the expression 'some time' consists of two words, I confirmed it, after which you became indignant as to whether the expression was appropriate. now the situation is repeating itself: you asked if the Americans use 'mustn't and what it means with them. answer is they do and it's same thing. and now you show us the 
[01:48:36] <StayHungry> British are expressing disbelief differently by using can't instead of musn't, which is special case that I have never denied.

[01:52:25] <StayHungry> you can't be rich (BrE) vs you musn't be rich (AmE) is a special case. it has nothing to do with usual with common use of musn't which is the same between these dialects, e.g. 'you mustn't let them go outside, there is covid-19!' means the same in AmE and BrE
[01:54:41] <GuiToris> this is another sense, what the heck are you talking about?! Isn't this what I was asking?
[01:55:16] <GuiToris> [23:48] <GuiToris> in what sense do you use mustn't? 
[01:55:47] <LjL> apparently they get to decide what's normal and what's special ;P
[01:56:10] <MetaNova> GuiToris: an easier question to answer would have been, "How did you use mustn't?"
[01:56:32] <MetaNova> because then you don't have to both agree on 'what sense' it was used in
[01:57:06] <GuiToris> I'm used to using the word 'sense' because the dictionary that I use separate senses
[01:57:15] <MetaNova> ah
[01:57:51] <GuiToris> I thought everyone used 'sense'
[01:59:34] <GuiToris> thanks for helping!
[02:04:45] <StayHungry> ok, let's refresh the essentials then
[02:04:57] <StayHungry> I mustn't X means that it is imperative that I not do X
[02:05:06] <StayHungry> I can't X means that it is not possible for me to do X
[02:05:18] <StayHungry> but
[02:07:08] <StayHungry> when the meaning of must is 'logical conclusion', the usual negative is cannot (can't)
[02:07:28] <StayHungry> e.g. If you said that, you must be mistaken / If you said that, you can't be telling the truth
[02:08:00] <StayHungry> when the negative of must has the meaning 'it is not necessary', 'there is no obligation', need not (needn't) is used
[02:08:15] <StayHungry> e.g. Must I answer all the questions? No, you needn't answer them all.
[02:08:30] <StayHungry> and there are other 'special' cases like that
[02:09:53] <StayHungry> but in the original sense of the imperative, musn't is used in both dialects, although this one is predominantly in BrE

[08:20:38] <sbrown2> hackinghorn: There was a brief discussion about the use of "colleague" earlier this year on the Miriam-Webster podcast.
[08:20:57] <sbrown2> Just looked it up - https://www.iheart.com/podcast/867-word-matters-70240508/episode/47-a-totally-original-history-of-84260057/
[08:21:39] <sbrown2> They discuss the difference between colleague and coworker at the 13 minute mark (you can skip to it at the bottom of the screen after pressing play)
[08:23:00] <sbrown2> The main topic is the word "stereotype" but after that, they talk about "colleague".
[08:23:24] <hackinghorn> ah, interesting, thankss sbrown2 
[08:31:21] <twb> sbrown2: is the only difference that the former doesn't imply any work takes place
[08:35:09] <sbrown2> well, "colleague" is often used in a friendlier way whereas "coworker" tends to be more neutral (not positive or negative).
[08:36:22] <sbrown2> And that's drawing from the discussion on the podcast from the dictionary makers.

[08:37:13] <sbrown2> But neither of the words address a hierarchical relationship like the word "boss", as hackinghorn was asking about originally.
[08:37:45] <hackinghorn> interesting
[08:38:11] <hackinghorn> I assume dictionary makers know better hehe
[08:38:40] <sbrown2> I actually started listening to it again after posting that link, so it's fresh in my mind again.

[23:16:05] <GuiToris> hello, another question for the American ones. I've been struggling with this for a while now. How are 'has to' and 'had to' pronounced? hazto: https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/media/english/us_pron_ogg/h/has/has_t/has_to__us_1.ogg or hasto: https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/media/english/us_pron_ogg/h/has/has_t/has_to_1_us_1_rr.ogg
[23:16:36] <GuiToris> and hadto: https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/media/english/us_pron_ogg/h/had/had_t/had_to_1_us_1_rr.ogg or hatto: https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/media/english/us_pron_ogg/h/had/had_t/had_to_1_us_2.ogg
