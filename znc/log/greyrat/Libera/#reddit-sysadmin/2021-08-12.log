[07:04:56] <JollyRgrs> why do you need a kernel larger than 1GB?
[07:04:58] <xe0n> the intended use...isnt it?
[07:05:07] <CableNinja> > PXELINUX doesn't limit the size of an initrd or memdisk; in practice, they
[07:05:08] <CableNinja> > need to fit into memory uncompressed.  If you're using a Linux kernel,
[07:05:08] <CableNinja> > it needs to specifically fit into the "kernel" part of the memory space, which
[07:05:08] <CableNinja> > is usually just under 1 GB.
[07:05:10] <JollyRgrs> are you trying to PXE boot to full blown OS?
[07:05:14] <xe0n> ^^
[07:05:38] <JollyRgrs> directions: do not use except as intended
[07:05:41] <CableNinja> JollyRgrs, it normally wasnt that size but a change led to our netboot kernel blowing up in size and we discovered that issue
[07:05:58] <JollyRgrs> so you blame PXE for your own faults?

[07:08:52] <xe0n> im not trolling!
[07:08:52] <JollyRgrs> CableNinja: what we don't understand is what changes are you making to a pre-boot environment?
[07:09:15] <xe0n> i literally pxe booted a machine yesterday lol!
[07:09:22] <xe0n> and installed the os, no wakkas
[07:09:27] <JollyRgrs> you only need the PXE boot image to be enough to set the parameters you need before saying "ok, copy this .wim/file/whatever to the HDD and then reboot"
[07:09:38] <xe0n> ^
[07:09:40] <CableNinja> JollyRgrs, it was a netboot cd, and we have a custom kernel that is also used on the cd. an option got left off during build that didnt clean out unused kernel symbols and resulting in an iso 3x larger than usual
[07:09:58] <JollyRgrs> ok... so... not PXE's fault

[07:41:42] <JollyRoger> I've also been experimenting with topping the burger with different things than fast food joints usually do, like sauteed red pepper slab or a slice of pan seared zucchini, or even putting the cheese into the pan and letting the cheese fry on the griddle until it browns and becomes crispy, then sticking it onto the burger patty with a bit more fresh cheese. 
[07:41:53] <misspwn> mmm

[07:43:20] <misspwn> one of my favorite combos is goat cheese/bacon jam
[07:43:26] <JollyRoger> Yeah. I don't always make the hamburger patties myself though, because it's a lot more work... but what I *did* try was buying those Costco branded kirkland sirloin burgers, wrapping them in bacon, and then frying them in the pan like that.
[07:43:31] <JollyRoger> Woah, that DOES sound really good! 
[07:44:07] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> I got ground turkey for $1.50/pound (sell by today special), so I grabbed a giant dented can of kidney beans. I made a huge pot of delicious, cheap chili. Eat it straight, or throw it over cascatelli pasta. Delicious.
[07:44:32] <JollyRoger> Mmm, chili!!
[07:44:50] <xe0n> did you say steak?!
[07:44:50] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> Bacon wrapping is great, but you might not sear the internal layers.
[07:44:53] <xe0n> I MEANT MISTAKE
[07:44:56] <xe0n> OHHHH YOU GOT ME ALL EXCITED
[07:45:01] <JollyRoger> xe0n: Ahahahahahahahaha
[07:45:23] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> Steak chili is awesome, but you work with what’s on sale.
[07:45:46] <JollyRoger> Yeah. It has to be cooked slower than a normal hamburger because the inside of the burger won't sear at all, and if you're not careful it just comes out overcooked >_<.
[07:46:16] <JollyRoger> I made this mistake the first time and the burger came out really overdone, and without that "grill" flavour.
[07:46:48] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> Cook the burger to some-pink, cook the bacon until it’s only slightly loose, then assemble and try your luck.
[07:46:54] <JollyRoger> I think I will try that!
[07:47:08] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> The bacon-burger patty is probably your best bet, if not visually.
[07:47:34] <JollyRoger> Something I've enjoyed doing for chili is actually using a piece of eye of round, because you can buy that stuff for really cheap at Wholesale Club or Costco and usually you can walk away with a two kilogram slab of beef, for around thirty dollars (Canadian). 
[07:47:49] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> Or just pretend you’re Harley Morenstein: https://youtu.be/4fL2A_PTJkY
[07:48:08] <JollyRoger> Don't get me wrong it *is* tough if you just prepare it like that but if you slow-cook it with the chili overnight it will become nice and soft and fall apart under the pressure of a fork.
[07:48:21] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> Oh, of course, JollyRoger. As long as it’s tender, it’s great.
[07:48:24] <JollyRoger> Yeah!
[07:48:54] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> Chili can impart strong flavors, so you can throw in almost anything.
[07:49:03] <JollyRoger> But it needs to be cooked for at least the night and never boiled over, if it boils it just becomes tough and dry.
[07:49:26] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> I tossed in some leftover peas one time. Not awful, but it prevented food waste.
[07:49:32] <JollyRoger> Makes sense!
[07:49:55] <xe0n> i do fried rice sometimes when i need to use up random shit
[07:49:58] <xe0n> chuck it all in a wok
[07:50:04] <xe0n> got yourself a fry rye!
[07:50:14] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> I’ve done that too. It’s more work but it works!
[07:50:18] <xe0n> ++
[07:50:20] <JollyRoger> Yeah! Or if you have some soup stock!
[07:50:43] <zetorian> Fried rice is my go-to to clean out the fridge.
[07:50:48] <xe0n> nice!
[07:50:50] <JollyRoger> Makes sense.
[07:50:57] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> I make my own bone broth. I save up all my chicken bones until I have enough for a pot.
[07:51:36] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> Then you can make regular lentils or white rice that’s actually amazing. Add whatever mix-ins.
[07:51:39] <JollyRoger> Wow. I should start doing that, that's a great idea, come to think of it.
[07:52:06] <JollyRoger> Think maybe what I could do would be to keep a tub of bones in the freezer and just save them up until I have enough to make a big pot all at the same time.
[07:52:58] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> I have power outlets on my deck, so I’ll throw bones, skin, gristle, onion husks, water, and herbs in a slow cooker outside. Cook on low for a few days. If the bones turn to sand when you press on them, you win.
[07:53:31] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> I went to donate blood one time after making and eating soup. My iron levels couldn’t be measured.
[07:53:47] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> (No danger. It was right after eating.)
[07:53:49] <JollyRoger> Brilliant. I think I could run a cord out my window onto the balcony, that would keep the thing from steaming up the place. 
[07:53:55] <JollyRoger> Hoho wow!
[07:54:26] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> Boiling bones, organs, and other waste smells awful. But the result is wonderful — and healthy!
[07:54:35] <JollyRoger> Yeah!
[07:54:35] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> So do it outside.
[07:54:42] <JollyRoger> Got it! I will do that then! 
[07:55:14] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> Look up the paleo recipes. I’m not anymore but they do it right.
[07:55:35] <JollyRoger> I will!
[07:55:49] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> The bones turn to sand (when squeezed) because you leech out all those minerals and nutrients.
[07:55:55] <JollyRoger> Wow. 
[07:56:33] <JollyRoger> I'm gonna definitely take full advantage of this, I've been starting up an exercise regimen and I'm gonna need all the good food I can get.
[07:57:20] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> Just keep the heat low. You don’t want to boil the gelatin apart. But if you screw up, you have regular stock, and that’s also tasty.
[07:57:39] <JollyRoger> Got it, keep the heat low, don't boil it... writing that down.
[07:57:43] <zetorian> I distinctly remember enjoying crushing the bones when my gran used to make soup. that's the best stuff.
[07:57:57] <JollyRoger> Hahaha I guess that's how they make bonemeal~!
[07:58:10] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> Oh yeah. Homemade soup in the winter? Awesome.
[07:58:36] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> I’ve never even thought about bonemeal, but I guess that’s a thing you could do afterwards.
[07:58:52] <JollyRoger> Yeah. Could save it for other things or give it to the pets.
[07:59:32] <JollyRoger> Yeah, soup in the wintertime is boss. I used to carry a thermos to work, since it could get pretty cold at times. 
[07:59:42] <sd> 09<s​ignofzeta> I haven’t tried this, but some people get a cheap $5 rotisserie chicken from Costco (or your local store). Eat the meat. Use the bones.

[17:58:02] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> how big Mike?
[17:58:06] <JollyRgrs> :P
[17:58:08] <xe0n> fat images suck
[17:58:18] <PublicWiFi> ^
[17:58:19] <fritzwastaken> Thin image, then configure with scripts
[17:58:20] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> we've always been Eaton for the big boys, APC for desktop crap
[17:58:24] <PublicWiFi> I wouldn't do that much awmv 
[17:58:48] <PublicWiFi> and yeah JollyRgrs is right, a lot of that can be set via GPO
[17:58:50] <JollyRgrs> everything you "sysprep" into an image, you gotta redo the image all over again next time you need to update any of that software
[17:58:53] <PublicWiFi> no need to hardwire it into an image
[17:59:02] <xe0n> task sequence ftw
[17:59:05] <xe0n> mdt bro
[17:59:06] <PublicWiFi> yeah MDT/WDS is wayyy better
[17:59:08] <PublicWiFi> yeah
[17:59:13] <JollyRgrs> script what you can, install/run that script during OSD
[17:59:14] <PublicWiFi> then you can update the packages without having to re-capture
[17:59:15] <corn266> @onenerdyguy that's how we're doing it currently Eaton seems decent
[17:59:21] <MikeSpears> 1080VA 650W is the current one that just died
[17:59:31] <JollyRgrs> use MDT to install the applications, and script the installer if you need other config things done in registry, etc.
[17:59:35] <PublicWiFi> ^
[17:59:45] <PublicWiFi> pretty sure you can script sql install yeah?
[17:59:51] <awmv> I'm trying to reduce the manual configuration after the deployment as it prevents me from developing software which is supposed to be my real job. I know nothing about deploying os images.
[17:59:52] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[17:59:55] <MikeSpears> I kinda wanna go slightly bigger this time around, but that size is fine
[17:59:59] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> then find someone who does
[18:00:02] <PublicWiFi> yeah that's what i'd do awmv 
[18:00:03] <JollyRgrs> awmv: right... that's what a TASK SEQUENCE does
[18:00:04] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you're a dev doing ops work, and you're doing it wrong
[18:00:06] <PublicWiFi> what JollyRgrs says
[18:00:14] <PublicWiFi> check out MDT awmv 
[18:00:17] <JollyRgrs> you were mentioning to upload it to MDT earlier.... MDT can do tasks both before AND after OS install
[18:00:23] <PublicWiFi> its life changing for windows image work
[18:00:36] <PublicWiFi> JollyRgrs: ++ 
[18:00:43] <MikeSpears> Vertiv appears to have some nice smaller UPS'

[20:07:54] <DoTheNeedful> Quote #382 added, check it out on https://dotheneedful.online
[20:08:32] <PublicWiFi> I was having a bad day at work one time and was rushing and really struggling to get shit done. An old guy that worked they told me something that I've really tried to keep. "Slow down there son, you'll get more done."
[20:08:46] <PublicWiFi> it makes perfect sense
[20:09:14] <gibby> Meaning, not a lot on our plate currently. I was elaborating on automating the easy, trivial shit, so when we're actually busy we can work on those items with our full attention
[20:09:28] <catbeard> "hope you don't do everything that fast big boy"
[20:09:31] <teh_f4ll3n> It is common practice (although not universally so) to add comments to code to help
[20:09:31] <teh_f4ll3n> anyone reading the code to understand what the code does, what its intent was, any
[20:09:31] <teh_f4ll3n> design decisions the programmer made etc.
[20:09:43] <teh_f4ll3n> not universally so...
[20:10:01] <catbeard> i add code to my comments
[20:10:03] <JollyRgrs> teh_f4ll3n: anyone reading the code... including one's own self
[20:10:03] <teh_f4ll3n> not commenting should be a criminal offence
[20:10:11] <mistiry> well, i mean its not. either the devs are lazy, or code has been optimized and/or minified to meet certain constraints
[20:10:16] <gibby> And then finding something that engages the individual so they're enjoying the work they do. If that RL when everything else is complete, fine.

[20:12:20] <ThatOneRoadie> the database servers are a little... beefy.
[20:12:21] <JollyRgrs> the point gibby was saying was that a sound mind gets more work done. if you are 100% work work work and no time to "let it simmer"... your head asplode!
[20:12:35] <catbeard> workworkwork workworkwork
[20:12:39] <JollyRgrs> ThatOneRoadie: what's the cpu/ram for SQL?
[20:12:44] <ThatOneRoadie> Yes.
[20:12:49] <teh_f4ll3n> wokwokwokwokwok wokwokwokwokwok
[20:12:53] <ThatOneRoadie> All the CPU, all the RAM
[20:12:54] <JollyRgrs> and you are running SQL on a diff server than the site servers i presume?
[20:12:55] <gibby> JollyRgrs++++++++
[20:12:58] <catbeard> gentlement, affairs of state must take precedence of affairs .. of state
[20:13:10] <ThatOneRoadie> Yeah, SQL is its own host cluster
[20:13:14] <JollyRgrs> i'm srsly thinking about trying to move the SQL to the primary server (we only have ~50k devices)
[20:13:26] <ThatOneRoadie> That was our biggest improvement back when we had 50k devices
[20:13:34] <ThatOneRoadie> stood up a SQL HA Cluster on SSD's
[20:13:40] <ThatOneRoadie> holy shit it was greased lightning
[20:13:45] <ThatOneRoadie> until we got to about 250k devices
[20:14:19] <JollyRgrs> ThatOneRoadie: any tips for getting console to run faster from endpoints (laptops)? everyone has to use jump servers b/c console is soooooooooo slow on their own devices
[20:14:37] <ThatOneRoadie> Console is hot garbage
[20:14:40] <ThatOneRoadie> we installed it on Horizon
[20:14:43] <JollyRgrs> yeah, that's true
[20:14:53] <ThatOneRoadie> bunch of horizon VDI's near the server
[20:14:58] <JollyRgrs> and that was host.... yeah, near the server
[20:15:02] <ThatOneRoadie> it makes like 500-1000 requests for everything you click
[20:15:08] <JollyRgrs> that's what we're doing with our jump server right now
[20:15:10] <JollyRgrs> IKR!
[20:15:12] <ThatOneRoadie> so we have it on a 10 gig to the sccm server
[20:15:22] <ThatOneRoadie> and just have it as a horizon app
[20:15:24] <JollyRgrs> "i clicked the item, now I wait 2 minutes before I can right click"
[20:15:53] <JollyRgrs> I wonder if I could get my company to go for that
[20:16:05] <JollyRgrs> I doubt it though, not enough people using it at the moment for them to "splurge" on that
[20:16:18] <ThatOneRoadie> yeah, we already had the horizon environment
[20:16:26] <JollyRgrs> however, we're moving to a "global" L1 support... so it might be closer to needed
[20:16:27] <ThatOneRoadie> so it wasn't a huge cost for a ~50 user app
[20:16:32] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[20:16:52] <JollyRgrs> that's the thing... at my old job (hospital) we had horizon all setup and stuff... adding another wouldn't be bad
[20:17:08] <JollyRgrs> here, we just had citrix and we're moving everyone off of that and into azure things
[20:17:43] <ThatOneRoadie> I think you can get horizon cloud on azure for somewhat reasonable cost
[20:17:51] <ThatOneRoadie> I mean, it's azure, so reasonable is relative
[20:17:53] <ThatOneRoadie> but still
[20:18:03] <JollyRgrs> but we have no one to manage it

[20:28:20] <oxipital> do you think apple understands ajax and search term prediction
[20:28:52] <ThatOneRoadie> Well, CSAM isn't Ajax
[20:29:07] <oxipital> sure, just saying
[20:29:45] <ThatOneRoadie> it's "Hash every image in your photo library, and if the Hash matches a blacklist provided by the kiddie porn alliance, https://i.imgur.com/IWPisMn.gif "
[20:30:01] <ThatOneRoadie> Because Apple hasn't heard of hash collisions before or anything
[20:31:50] <ThatOneRoadie> Pure of heart
[20:31:52] <ThatOneRoadie> Dumb of ass.
[20:31:56] <JollyRgrs> ThatOneRoadie: so apple says this will trigger internally, and someone will manually inspect to verify if it is CP or not before alerting authorities, etc.
[20:32:01] <mistiry> so, first, Apple can't arrest you. most they can do is report you. and its not really the same, in one you have a sysadmin that doesnt understand web technology, in the other you have actual content on a device that, based on hash, appears to match a known list of illicit content.

[20:32:16] <oxipital> hahahah
[20:32:19] <oxipital> stay classy
[20:32:31] <oxipital> this guys a douche both at work and home
[20:33:36] <ThatOneRoadie> My worry really is that second bit. Appears to match a list of illicit content. A list provided by a third party, with no way to determine if what they put on it is actually illicit content or not, and no method to fight any claims they or apple may make.
[20:33:53] <ThatOneRoadie> It's one of those "who watches the watchmen" things, and (for me) it's beyond the pale
[20:33:56] <JollyRgrs> oxipital: why is he a douche?
[20:34:04] <PublicWiFi> eset is really going to make me create a Non-RFC1918 zone -.-
[20:34:06] <JollyRgrs> i wouldn't want a pee/poopy dog in my house that wasn't mine
[20:34:17] <oxipital> heh
[20:34:17] <PublicWiFi> i usually do a !($PrivateRanges) type deal, rip
[20:34:30] <PublicWiFi> anyone have a list handy? LOL
[20:34:51] <JollyRgrs> ThatOneRoadie: did you see what i just said?
[20:35:03] <mistiry> ThatOneRoadie: that's why there is more review they have to do. the matching hash is just a flag that there _might_ be something illicit.
[20:35:06] <JollyRgrs> the hash alerts a real life person to verify the content
[20:35:12] <JollyRgrs> only then, is action taken
[20:35:23] <mistiry> so then they have verification against the flagged content to actually verify if further action is needed
[20:35:56] <ThatOneRoadie> So if something is close enough, my photo is automatically sent to someone to look at, without my permission or consent. Cool. Now, if someone adds a hash of, say, the windows logo to their database.

[20:36:45] <PublicWiFi> wonder if this is all of them lol
[20:37:13] <mistiry> also, hash collisions are exceedingly uncommon, its not like you take a random photo at the beach and its suddenly flagged as CP
[20:37:32] <ThatOneRoadie> It's pretty well known that Facebook's Content Moderators pretty much all get shitty depression and PTSD. https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/facebook-moderators-ptsd-settlement/
[20:37:37] <JollyRgrs> ThatOneRoadie: close enough? no... if your photo matches the exact hash that the CP group maintains of KNOWN photos of CP...
[20:37:50] <PublicWiFi> im not sure how well it would work anyways, manipulating the picture at all would create a new hash right?
[20:37:57] <PublicWiFi> it would only catch the dumbest of criminals
[20:38:02] <ThatOneRoadie> That's just it. We're all collectively trusting/justifying that "a trusted" third party is maintaining that list
[20:38:11] <ThatOneRoadie> now let's expand that third party a bit.
[20:38:33] <ThatOneRoadie> Say the NSA wants to do the same thing, but for pictures of, say, known radioactive material logos.

[20:40:01] <mistiry> also NSA has their own mechanisms, they dont need to inject images into a CP hash db, what point would that serve?
[20:40:04] <ThatOneRoadie> That's adorable
[20:40:16] <mistiry> ThatOneRoadie: they've fought against the FBI trying to force them to unlock a phone
[20:40:25] <mistiry> they do have a bit of track record when it comes to fighting against that kind of thing
[20:40:28] <ThatOneRoadie> Yeah, that was because they literally had no keys/backdoors
[20:40:31] <ThatOneRoadie> it was technically impossible
[20:40:35] <mistiry> no it wasnt
[20:40:36] <ThatOneRoadie> now it's technically possible.
[20:40:43] <mistiry> the FBI did it, just not with apple's help
[20:41:08] <mistiry> apple refused to assist. fbi paid someone else to figure it out. 
[20:41:29] <mistiry> it wasnt impossible, it was not something apple was legally required to do, so they didnt
[20:41:33] <corn266> some business out in isreal
[20:41:45] <corn266> they sell the thing to police departments now
[20:41:45] <ThatOneRoadie> Sure; the FBI was asking apple to use a backdoor code or break the encryption, which they couldn't do. Someone else did something apple wouldn't (like probably detached the secure enclave chip, made a copy, and hammered a pin until it matched)
[20:42:16] <mistiry> right, they told FBI to fuck off they werent going to do help them break into the device.
[20:42:33] <ThatOneRoadie> They're not going to inject into a CP hash DB; they're going to tell apple, in a secret, sealed FISA warrant, that they have to allow CSAM access to some alphabet agency somewhere.
[20:42:39] <mistiry> they *could* have helped if they wanted to

[20:43:03] <ThatOneRoadie> lmao
[20:43:37] <mistiry> ThatOneRoadie: but it was YOUR example about NSA injecting an image

[20:43:50] <mistiry> now you say they wont do it
[20:43:58] <ThatOneRoadie> It's the inherent trust of a third party
[20:44:03] <iphone> all you ladies must be jealous of this glorious nick
[20:44:15] <mistiry> you realize you trust tons of third parties NOW, right?
[20:44:21] <ThatOneRoadie> Yeah, we all agree to the T&C's of apple, and with any device, you trust the manufacturer isn't actively fucking you over
[20:44:27] <corn266> i don't trust a single one of you fucks
[20:44:45] <iphone> mistiry: not necessarily. Lots of people in tech don't use tech all that much
[20:44:45] <corn266> except a1
[20:44:52] <iphone> a1 auto?
[20:44:58] <ThatOneRoadie> but now the manufacturer is publicly saying "hey, we're going to be NeuralHashing all of your images, and we get to look at anything that matches what a third party is providing to us"

[20:45:07] <ThatOneRoadie> "But it's for the kids"

[20:46:26] <mistiry> iphone: a person is trusting third parties just by virtue of using the internet
[20:46:28] <zetorian> They will make a big public stink about the 'for the kids' part. Then a real quiet announcement when they start looking for media IP like pirated music.
[20:46:36] <iphone> decent ricky. what kind of cut are you going to use?
[20:46:40] <zetorian> They are trying to divert the public outrage to something they can defend.

[20:47:36] <corn266> we have a local farm nearby that sells massibe ribeye roasts that you can cut into your own steaks
[20:47:38] <iphone> but, it still tasted awesome
[20:47:54] <corn266> steak always tastes awesome
[20:48:00] <corn266> unless it's well done
[20:48:16] <ThatOneRoadie> Well, the exception to that is Brisket
[20:48:20] <ThatOneRoadie> Brisket is way past well done
