[00:08:48] <thblt> Wait line-numbers stuff wasn't migrated, the C version is a new impl.

[03:05:26] <gg> ah ? Not that on my Debian I have not the latest emacs
[03:06:40] <ytc> ido mode is coming by default in 28.  i don't know about 27.  and it has "recent-files" feature i guess.
[03:06:48] <gg> for example I had to go to emacs 26 for .. I don't remember what, when I tried to use a LSP, but i did have to install emacs 26

[03:09:33] <ytc> but i know for sure that xah packages won't be default since it changes emacs's structure.

[06:48:53] <trevoke> wkmanire: oh, uh, the readme for 2.0 needs significant revamping, as I have managed to make a large amount of the configuration optional and better bounded to the package through custom variables, so if you're familiar with elisp, the source code might actually be more helpful than the readme right now
[06:50:01] <Cairn> twb: I'm actually trying to use it for most of the symbols on a regular keyboard, along with many that aren't.
[06:50:08] <wkmanire> I'm pretty familiar, but no expert.
[06:50:47] <Cairn> I'm planning to write an Emacs interface to replace compose (for this specific purpose), so that I can use tab complete and other benefits. But I'm sticking with it for now.

[14:35:30] <Pickchea> Hello! Why is it usually the case that functions have to be added to hooks like (add-hook 'x-hook (lambda () (y-mode))) instead of (add-hook 'x-hook y-mode)?

[14:38:42] <schmudde> I'm not an elisp expert, but I assume it's because you want to delay the evaluation of y-mode until the x-hook is called.
[14:38:53] <schmudde> In the second example, y-mode would be evaluated when you set the hook.

[14:51:59] <jamzattack> Pickchea: In that example, wrapping y-mode in a lambda is entirely redundant -- https://jamzattack.xyz/tmp/hook-explanation.org
[14:52:08] <bpalmer> Pickchea: note that (add-hook 'x-hook 'y-mode) would work just fine.
[14:52:36] <bpalmer> Pickchea: the reason you can't use an unquoted y-mode is because elisp is a lisp-2.
[14:53:58] <bpalmer> (schmudde's point is somewhat apt in slightly different situations, but this is a more general issue)
[14:54:00] *** Quits: sm2 (~sm1@2601:44:8701:9420::76d) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[14:54:58] <bpalmer> one reason you sometimes see people use lambdas is because they want to pass an argument; for example, if y-mode were a minor mode, you might want to make sure to turn it on by calling (y-mode 1)  instead of just (y-mode)
[14:54:59] <schmudde> bpalmer: I thought Lisp-2 only had to do with how a symbol was bound? Is binding the reason you have to pass it as a literal?
[14:55:02] <Pickchea> jamzattack, wow, thanks for the write up! :-)
[14:55:52] <bpalmer> schmudde: (defvar foo 7)  (defun foo () 2) <-- foo's function slot is bound to a function that returns 2, but if you evaluate the expression "foo" by itself, you get its value slot
[14:56:22] <bpalmer> (add-hook 'x-hook y-mode) <-- that takes y-mode's value slot and puts it on the hook.

[14:57:01] <schmudde> oh it does have to do with binding but not in the way I thought. Thanks for the explanation, bpalmer. 
[14:57:06] <bpalmer> run-hooks will go over a specified list and, if it's a lambda or raw function, calls it directly; if it's a symbol, it looks up the function slot and calls that.

[14:58:32] <bpalmer> you're right, though, there are potential late binding situations; for example, (add-hook 'x-hook 'y-mode)  and then you redefine y-mode with (defun y-mode () ...) , run-hooks will look up the latest definition of y-mode and call that at run time
[14:59:11] <bpalmer> but (add-hook 'x-hook (symbol-function 'y-mode)) adds the function in y-mode's function slot at the time of the add-hook

[15:06:41] <gueorgui> Another elisp newbie question: what's the right way to define temporary variables to use within a function? I thought using `let` would do the trick but emacs complains that I'm referring to a free variable for `days-since` and `weeks` in here: https://gist.github.com/gueorgui/9b9c5730f1e6fccc98ae30c6061e3626
[15:08:31] <jamzattack> gueorgui: `let' doesn't allow let-bound variables to reference other variables bound within the same let form -- use `let*' for that
[15:08:56] <bpalmer> conceptually, all the variables inside a let are bound "at the same time"
[15:09:27] <jamzattack> from the `let' docstring > All the VALUEFORMs are evalled before any symbols are bound

[15:15:47] <bpalmer> dragestil: (note that #emacs is often topic unlocked, so don't actually edit the topic unless you mean to)

[15:36:48] <bpalmer> Pickchea: yes, basically. the standard hook functions do not support that sort of expression.
[15:37:28] <bpalmer> you could write your own hook like thing that handles lists separately, but run-hooks does not do that
[15:37:57] <thblt> Pickchea: your (eval) example is invalid, you'd need `(funcall (lambda` for it to work.
[15:38:39] <bpalmer> Actually, ((lambda () 3)) => 3  ; lambda in head position is special cased.
[15:39:27] <thblt> erm, sorry, thanks.
[15:39:37] <bpalmer> Not very common, though.
[15:39:44] <thblt> Thinking out loud: wouldn't it make sense that add-hook accept arbitrary forms and wrap them into a lambda if they're not (functionp)?
[15:39:54] <bpalmer> I'm not sure if the equivalence argument is about how things are (in which case they're not equivalent except, I guess, under eval); or how things should be.

[15:41:06] <bpalmer> Pickchea: what's the error?
[15:42:26] <thblt> bpalmer: indeed, that's probably a better idea. The performance cost would be minimal anyway.
[15:42:51] <Pickchea> bpalmer, Symbol's function definition is void: dired-omit-mode. But when I evaluate (load "dired-x") everything works just fine, which tells me that (load "dired-x") is not evaluated when I open a directory with dired.
[15:44:06] <Pickchea> Also, before interactively calling (load "dired-x"), I get no auto-completion for dired-omit-mode, but after loading it, I do.
[15:44:14] <s-liao> Load and eval are different things
[15:44:28] <Pickchea> s-liao, indeed.
[15:44:47] <rnkn> Pickchea: you just (require 'dired-x)

[15:47:34] <bpalmer> Pickchea: I'm not sure  when dired-load-hook is run; the general approach which should work for dired-x as well is (with-eval-after-load "dired" (require 'dired-x))

[15:49:53] <rnkn> Pickchea: dired-MODE-hook not dired-LOAD-hook
[15:50:50] <s-liao> It is like the extra file for dir module.
[15:51:05] <Pickchea> rnkn, I swear to God, it says (add-hook 'dired-load-hook (lambda () ("dired-x"))).
[15:51:40] <rnkn> are you there God? it's me, rnkn
[15:51:45] <rnkn> no answer
[15:51:50] <Pickchea> and then (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook (lambda () (dired-omit-mode 1))).
[15:51:57] <Pickchea> which is exactly what I have.
[15:52:14] <rnkn> you can avoid these errors by using the built-in options interface, M-x customize-option
[15:52:21] <thblt> dired-load-hook is obsolete in 28.1
[15:52:37] <rnkn> so, M-x customize-option RET dired-mode-hook, add dired-omit-mode, then it's all pancakes
[15:52:39] <thblt> You could just (with-eval-after-load 'dired (require 'dired-x))
[15:52:50] <Pickchea> rnkn, guess what I was doing before writing it manually into my init file.

[18:21:21] <rpav> (and they prefer "smart" interpretation to command-oriented interfaces)

[18:25:46] <rpav> right, thus don't think about "understanding"

[20:01:09] <rpav> like if the shell is a problem that's almost entirely a user issue rather than a dependent-app issue

[20:02:04] <johnjay> yak shaving is more like when you have to fix a bug A. that leads to problem C. to fix that you need D. etc

[20:07:30] <Devon> That was easy, the hideif maintainers (Marick, LaLiberte & Lee) actually documented it.  So unusual!  In addition to turning the mode on, I have to activate it with an additional command.
