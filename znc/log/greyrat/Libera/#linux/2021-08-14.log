[04:51:40] <ciphrCat> ayecee: i overlooked your comment about losetup.  I believe this is why fsck didn't detect the filesystem.. because the file contained a whole volume & had partitions within it.  Losetup is needed to ensure that fsck is run on just the partition within, as follows: https://chrisdown.name/2011/06/01/fsck-partitions-inside-an-image.html  /cc simbaclaws rascul

[04:59:47] <ayecee> but sometimes it's that a particular function is not thought to be able to fail in a particular way
[04:59:49] <Gustavo6046> plus what if something is slanted sideways against the camera? the part closest to the camera would just render as the same distance as where the centre hit
[05:00:09] <mlu> or even if unintentional, it probably just got ignored due to actual indended uses
[05:00:09] <rascul> it's very rare that i come across a tool that can't handle a relative path

With MBR extended, and definitely worth GPT, the partition "table" is actually a series of chunks in between the partitions themselves, so if you move them you overwrite the data

[07:04:21] <omero> it depends. tabernae is a common 'definition'

[10:53:44] <ayecee> you can't see a reboot and just assume it was a panic.
[10:53:59] <ayecee> a panic is a specific event, and a reboot can happen without that.

[12:25:36] <folaht> It's the first time I'm building a vm using vagrant.
[12:25:44] <ayecee> looks like "vagrant ssh", after the error, lets you connect to the vm, if i'm understanding this right
[12:26:07] <ayecee> if that works, from there you could run journalctl
[12:27:11] <folaht> That doesn't work because the box has not been built.
[12:27:13] <chives> Yall know is there a way to ... idk if im doing this right but i really dont like the facebook tracking thing in all my web pages... so what i've done is tried to container it to one tab in firefox... but... even though im not logged in in the generic/default container... its still in the background of these websites according to firefox trask manager "tracking"
[12:27:31] <chives> so i was wondering if somehow i could block facebook maybe in containers by default?
[12:27:37] <ayecee> folaht: i don't follow. that sudo command, is it running in the vm or outside it?
[12:28:10] <Praxis> so why would ubuntu use eno1 instead of the eth1, through eth4? and why does it move when it reboots?

[12:29:43] <matsaman> Praxis: stupid persistent names for servers with multiple network devices
[12:29:49] <ayecee> Praxis: it's part of "predictable network interface names", and the devices would normally have separate names based on the index numbers provided by the firmware/bios.
[12:29:57] <ayecee> for some reason all your interfaces were given the same name.
[12:30:05] <matsaman> you can disable it from GRUB, but that's really no fun to do in Ubuntu
[12:30:06] <ayecee> maybe they all have the same index in the bios.

[12:31:07] <ayecee> Praxis: this gives a background of how it works. your options are to disable it or change the policy it uses to name the interfaces. https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/

[12:34:00] <ayecee> chives: as you can firewall by ip but not by name, you'd have to first identify the network ranges for facebook first.
[12:34:16] <folaht> ayecee, I don't follow it either, because it should be running in the vm as part of an automatic packaging process where the iso gets downloaded, loaded in a hypervisor, then several commands are called according to a configuration file, but I only see the boot command being called, which install ssh configurations. I suppose what happens after that is that packer then calls `vagrant ssh` logs in and then calls the shutdown command.
[12:34:44] <ayecee> chives: dns queries would be some, but it's kind of a game of whack-a-mole that way.

I got an email complaining abuse of ssh service, lots of authentication requests coming from my IP, looks like I have some malware in my network... unfortunately I don't have a firewall and the modem logs don't seem very helpful and there are 30+ devices online right now geographically dislocated... any tips on how I could identify the offending host?

[17:58:09] <phogg> I am not familiar with split archive zip files. How does one join them?
[17:58:31] <phogg> I generally split with split(1) and then join with cat(1) because it's easy.
[17:59:10] <rapha> apparently under linux you have to cat(1) them and then repair them before unzip will work
[17:59:24] <rapha> s/under linux/on the commandline/
[17:59:46] <phogg> some quick searching suggests that zip natively understands how to re-join files created from zip -s
[17:59:57] <rapha> the last time i had to deal with them was in my 1336 w4r3z days as a teenager
[17:59:58] <kfrench> I've never seen a cat be useful.

[20:13:37] <siwica> I've been capturing network traffic with wireshark on a system and countet ~20.000 incoming packets within 100s. By comparing the numbers in /proc/softirqs before and after this period I found that ~29.000 NET_RX soft interrupts were triggered during these 100s. Can I assume the excessive ~9.000 NET_RX irqs stem from Unix Domain Sockets or is it possible that an incoming packet triggers more that one interrupt?

[20:13:42] *** Joins: Nimzowitsch (~nimzo@user/nimzowitsch)
[20:14:12] <Psi-Jack> Well, amixer would generally change the actual volume of the sound card, rather than the pulseaudio mixer volume.

[20:45:53] <dreamcat4> hi there guys, i seem to have a memory leak on my system. it's about 10gb usage after reboot. that creeps up now to 45gb used ATM (and keeps getting higher)
[20:46:23] <dreamcat4> any way to find out what it actually is? tried quitting a lots of apps, it will free (at most) about 10gb of that
[20:46:58] <dreamcat4> on my shortlist not tried (remaining to check is): zfs, gdm3, and pipewire
[20:47:58] <ayecee> how much memory do you have
[20:48:13] <dreamcat4> 64gb. (but that will all get eaten eventually)
[20:48:20] <ayecee> what happens when it gets eaten
[20:49:06] <ayecee> let's see the output from free -m, in a pastebin
[20:49:10] <dreamcat4> the whole system becomes really unresponsive. until i quit some programs. but that only delays the need to reboot and puts it off a bit

[20:52:11] <ayecee> what you're describing sounds like normal memory use over time, with the cache growing to fill unused ram. except for the last part where it becomes unresponsive when it's full, which sounds like what would happen if you either didn't have swap or fiddled with the swappiness.

[23:22:06] <tgarder> lol i just heard Linus Torvalds uses microemacs still to this day, and pico was based on microemacs, and nano emulates pico so Linus basically uses nano. Good stuff for the elitists out there.

[23:23:04] <tgarder> University of Washington's simple text editor Pico was based on MicroEMACS 3.6. Pico's featureset and interface would later be emulated in the free software clone GNU nano due to its ambiguous licensing terms.[5]
