[02:05:31] <rendar> yeah, i meant with 'sudo'
[02:05:38] <rendar> let me tell you my problem
[02:06:22] <rendar> i'm using zfs filesystem, and to sync my zfs filesystem to a remote machine, the way to do that is: `zfs send params ... | ssh remotehost zfs recv params ...`
[02:06:25] <wuseman> sudo sh -c "echo 'foo' >> /etc/sudoers" works fine
[02:06:37] *** Quits: CaCode (~CaCode@user/cacode) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[02:06:41] <rendar> the problem in this way, is that zfs should be run as root
[02:07:46] <rendar> and, i can't do `sudo zfs send params ... | ssh remotehost sudo zfs recv params ...`
[02:08:11] <rendar> so, i thought to add to sudoers to allow to run 'zfs' from user, without asking a root password
[02:08:37] <rendar> but i don't want to leave to a single user the power of doing anything with the zfs command, so even erasing volumes and unmonuting disks
[02:08:40] <tgq> you can add it manually. You have to do it only once
[02:08:42] <rendar> any clean solutions?
[02:08:46] <tgq> ahh
[02:09:24] <tgq> you can ssh as root, but remote root logins are advised against
[02:09:32] <tgq> ssh root@remotehost command

[02:12:35] <rendar> yes, that would be a much better solution

[03:45:30] <earendel> it has been said already. it wasn't. it's just that uniq or sort -u  is the edge case to keeping commands atomic, and oriented on serving a single specific goal.
[03:47:17] <earendel> probably the reason why it has been picked. it still doesn't justify the doit function with a million parameters and lot of exceptional behavior.

[07:02:20] <up_running> Let’s say you have a Firefox webpage you’re viewing with a lot of bold text in red. I opened Developer Tools and went to Inspector.
[07:02:27] <up_running> There, I searched for #ff0000, which is the color red. After that, I went to the “This Element” area on the right and unclicked the box for the color #ff0000.
[07:02:34] <up_running> My problem is there are about 78 elements like this on the page and I was thinking there has to be a better way than just manually unchecking all 78 boxes.
[07:02:41] <up_running> Here’s the link for a visual:

[07:12:55] <up_running> I was referring to the coding part as the last time I posted here, a user mentioned that most posters here focusing on scripts.
[07:13:14] <tirnanog> not Javascript, however.
[07:13:21] <e36freak> !bashis
[07:13:21] <greybot> Bash is a shell. That's a program which can do simple math, logic, I/O and run other programs. It's NOT a terminal, it's not a kernel, it doesn't manage the system's authentication or environment, it's not your OS and it's not X, KDE or Gnome.
[07:13:43] <tirnanog> besides, it seems like an odd way of going about it. there are add-ons that allow for custom CSS to be applied,  such as Stylish.
[07:14:19] <tirnanog> so if you wanted a lead, that is my offering.
[07:15:13] <up_running> tirnanog: I wanted to avoid addons, if possible as I feel a simple script could handle it. I'm just not sure which one.
[07:15:34] <up_running> I did notice though that what is happening is this:
[07:16:45] <up_running> before I click the element button =>  "color: #ff0000;"
[07:16:48] <jmdaemon> what is your favorite bash shell script, alias or function?
[07:16:48] <up_running> after I click the element button => "/*! color: #ff0000; */"
[07:17:16] <earendel> !pe
[07:17:16] <greybot> Parameter Expansion expands parameters: "$foo", "$1". You can use it to perform string or array operations: "${file%.mp3}", "${0##*/}", "${files[@]: -4}". They should *always* be quoted. See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 and "Parameter Expansion" in man bash. Also see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe.
[07:17:24] <up_running> So, clicking the element adds `/*! */` to the #ff0000 element.

[11:27:30] <eternal_peril> Hi.   I have a bash script that runs in lighttpd.  Basically it loops and grabs a jpg image and I can create a mjpg.  It works great for one camera but for another, it sends additional data before the jpg comes though and corrupts the jpg.  Is there any easy way to ignore all data on the screen before I get the actual image
[11:27:31] <eternal_peril> https://pastebin.com/iNx36gEN is my script.   response I get is:  https://pastebin.com/gtepUY1i
[11:27:31] <pasteban> Paste is available without ads on https://pastebin.com/raw/gtepUY1i
[11:28:51] <lopid> imagine we don't know anything about this camera or what "additional data" is
[11:31:39] <eternal_peril> so my curl command just loops the jpg over and over again, like a webcam.   This camera though is sending in a bunch of stuff before the jpg.  My second pastbin.    So the goal woudl be to ignore everything from HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized  to HTTP/1.1 200 OK as it loops
[11:32:54] <lopid> curl -i: Include response headers
[11:33:34] <eternal_peril> I need the header though

[12:06:18] <genr8eofl_> that will work
[12:06:45] <genr8eofl_> but i need the original function's text so I can munge it and redefine it

[12:16:51] <genr8eofl_> thaanks! i can work with that
[12:17:00] <tirnanog> genr8eofl_: that still doesn't address the question of why you can't define a function of the same name that actually does what you want.
[12:18:00] <tirnanog> but anyway, there you have it. I probably don't want to know anyway.
[12:18:10] <earendel> he needed an example of what that function does or sth. you know. at least the signature.
[12:18:47] <earendel> so you say it shouldn't be a problem to rewrite it? thats good news i think.
[12:18:52] <tirnanog> that wasn't what was stated. the requirement was specifically stated as needing to munge the existing definition of a function.
[12:19:04] <tirnanog> which means taking shellcode and transforming it into something else.

[22:36:40] <olspookishmagus> how to have bash parse a text file containing lines with field separators $'\n' and record reparators $'\n' and put them into an "array"?
[22:36:54] <olspookishmagus> IIRC "array" is not a very popular term in here, amirite?
[22:37:14] <olspookishmagus> I will use that array then to do lookups, as in if the first field, matches, get the next fields
[22:37:15] <NRK[m]> bash has arrays
[22:37:23] <libc> for example: ls asjfdlakj | less
[22:37:45] <libc> instead of redirecting lsdfjsdlk to less i want it to be printed to stdin as usual

[23:27:23] <boreas> libc: if you write "progA | progB", the shell first creates progB to be able to read. If progA fails, progB is already runnint

[23:28:50] <earnestly> boreas: It creates the pipe and then executes (fork+exec) both at the same time (so-so)
[23:29:44] <boreas> earnestly: agreed, but the reader must exist alrady before a write can write
[23:29:56] <earnestly> No it blocks
[23:30:10] <earnestly> Uh

[23:39:44] <michigan> No, I've been looking for him for months now
[23:39:50] <michigan> Ever since the incident
[23:40:12] <boreas> ok,usually a parent process creates a pipe, and calls fork() causing a child to inherit the pipe, too. stdout of the parent is connected to stdin of the child using the pipe. If the writing process wrote something before the pipe connection, it would be lost and could not be redirected to the child afterwards.
[23:40:54] <emanuele6> "stdout of the parent is connected to stdin of the child using the pipe." that is not how it works

[23:42:24] <emanuele6> when you run `cmd1 | cmd2', the main shell fork()s once to create a subshell for cmd1 and fork()s another time to create a subshell for cmd2
[23:42:57] <emanuele6> then it connects its stdin to cmd1's stdin, cmd1's stdout to cmd2's stdin and cmd3's stdout to its stdout
[23:43:10] <emanuele6> it's not cmd1 that fork()s to create cmd2
[23:44:11] <emanuele6> am i wrong?
[23:44:16] <e36freak> nope
[23:44:35] <emanuele6> :)
[23:45:08] <e36freak> michigan: "the incident" ?
[23:45:13] <earnestly> Surely the pipes are setup first?
[23:45:34] <twkm> yes, it's the only way it can work.
[23:45:36] <e36freak> yes, redirections and pipe setup happens befor ethe exec
[23:45:37] <geirha> yes, so the pipe(s) can be inherited by the two forks
[23:47:38] <boreas> emanuele6: there's a difference between bash, who processes all pipelines in a subshell, and ksh who only creates a new process for the reading part
[23:48:09] <emanuele6> well, it could have also been something like fork() -> create pipe -> (fork and repeat for the other parts of the subshell).. -> exec()
[23:48:21] <emanuele6> i think
[23:48:37] <earnestly> ksh, which bash implements some of iirc, does have tricks for obviating forks for simple cases
[23:48:43] <emanuele6> but that can't possibly how bash implements it since then PIPESTATUS could not be implemented
[23:49:09] <boreas> agreed
[23:49:24] <emanuele6> s/of the subshell/of the pipeline/
[23:49:40] <earnestly> E.g. I think ksh can do foo=$(bar) without needing a subshell
