[02:18:47] <jasonwryan> imgur pages with the url structure imgur.com/a/foo won't load, but they do with --temp-basedir; what config settings should I isolate?
[02:19:13] <jasonwryan> other imgur pages (imgur.com/gallery/foo) load fineâ€¦
[02:20:27] <keir> jasonwryan: have you tried running `:adblock-update`?
[02:20:50] <jasonwryan> couple of times 
[02:21:16] <keir> and your python-adblock is up to date?
[02:21:24] *** ml_ is now known as ml
[02:22:22] <jasonwryan> I use a hosts file
[02:22:37] <keir> a custom hosts file?
[02:23:13] <jasonwryan> yep
[02:23:18] <keir> isolate that then
[02:23:43] <keir> try your usual qutebrowser set-up without it
[02:24:21] <jasonwryan> no change
[02:24:32] <jasonwryan> that should have broken the rest of imgur, presumably
[02:25:02] <mornfall> depends on how broken; might be nuking some external script
[02:25:18] <keir> ^^ the response i was just typing
[02:25:27] <mornfall> (but --temp-basedir presumably wouldn't fix that)
[02:25:30] <jasonwryan> yeah, I'm not sure of the diff between an album and a gallery
[02:25:55] <keir> it what way won't it load?
[02:25:59] <jasonwryan> the rest of the web works fine, fwiw (the parts I visit, anyway)
[02:26:22] <jasonwryan> starts to load, then just a dark page
[02:27:21] <keir> does `:devtools` confirm a DOM has been built?
[02:27:51] <keir> does network tab in devtools show assets have been downloaded
[02:28:23] <keir> (may need to reload with devtools open to see assets loading)
[02:29:33] <jasonwryan> https://0x0.st/-d_a.png 
[02:29:56] <jasonwryan> no idea
[02:30:15] <keir> look at the Network tab in devtools
[02:30:22] <keir> do a reload with it open
[02:30:35] <keir> look to see if there are any errors in the list of assets
[02:31:16] <keir> then move from the Network tab, and check the Console tab for any messages
[02:34:08] <jasonwryan> theres some stuff that is blocked (facebook, mostly), but also this https://0x0.st/-d_Q.png
[02:35:55] <jasonwryan> most of it seems to be blocked on successfully loaded pages as well tho
[02:36:26] <keir> are you getting all the same messages?
[02:36:33] <keir> including those TypeErrors
[02:37:02] <jasonwryan> no, the typeerrors are specific to the /a/foo failed loads
[02:37:10] <keir> that might be bingo then
[02:37:50] <jasonwryan> seems that way: any idea what they relate to?
[02:38:40] <keir> those are javascript files, webengine is reporting a TypeError
[02:39:12] <keir> that could be a mistake in the code that an Imgur dev has made, and a fix is inevitable
[02:39:24] <keir> or there's a problem your end
[02:39:42] <jasonwryan> can you load, for example, https://imgur.com/a/0Fv9BRi
[02:39:44] <keir> most likely removing your webengine caches will help
[02:39:55] <jasonwryan> ok, I'll try that
[02:40:51] <keir> there are files stored in the both .cache/qutebrowser and .local/share/qutebrowser
[02:41:01] <keir> I'd remove .cache/qutebrowser first
[02:41:12] <keir> then if no luck, .local/share/qutebrowser
[02:41:28] <keir> but that does contain your browsing history too
[02:41:36] <keir> if that is something you want to backkup
[02:42:07] <keir> `history.sqlite` is the ifle
[02:42:12] <keir> s/ifle/file
[02:43:12] <jasonwryan> removing .cache/qutebrowser didn't work, I'll go nuclear now
[02:43:15] <keir> you will lose cookies and local storage by remove .local/share/qutebrowser too
[02:43:23] <jasonwryan> thanks for the help keir !

[11:12:35] <patwid_> it used to work fine up until version 32 of pipewire
[11:13:09] <patwid_> when i test screensharing on webrtc gumtest page from mozilla with newer versions of pipewire i get an error:

[11:14:07] <patwid_> interestingly, it still works on chromium though
[11:14:48] <patwid_> oh and it happens also when i launch qutebrowser with temp-basedir
[11:17:41] <patwid_> and with the latest qutebrowser qt5 and qt5-webengine update screensharing works neither with v32 nor with v38

[11:35:39] <The-Compiler> jasonwryan: because if it's really not ~/.cache/qutebrowser and ~/.local/share/qutebrowser it kinda needs to be ~/.config/qutebrowser
