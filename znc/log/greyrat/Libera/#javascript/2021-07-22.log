[00:12:44] <huria4> There are various libraries like three.js that can do impressive stuff in javascript as if it was on a desktop. Is there any major difference in power capabilities in using raw javascript vs say webassembly?
[00:14:20] *** Joins: Akimb (~Akimb@86.100.13.100)
[00:14:47] <GreenJello> wasm gives you higher potential compute performance, but also overhead in copying buffers
[00:15:12] <entuland> compiling to webassembly is likely going to give a performance boost but a lot of the magic there is done with shaders in the GPU anyways, and that stuff gets compiled for the GPU regardless of whether you are running JS or wasm, for the little I understand about all of it

[00:16:33] <GreenJello> yeah, there's usually a way to make the CPU not be the bottleneck
[00:17:04] <entuland> it probably depends on how much you're doing in JS or in the shaders (and how good the code in both cases is, bad code compiled to wasm is likely going to stay bad)
[00:17:09] <GreenJello> unless you're trying to really push the limits of what's possible at your target frame rate
[00:19:19] <howdoi> Alexendoo: so, in `IsLooselyEqual` where is the case where `x` is null and `y` is Number
[00:19:53] <huria4> In terms of web gaming, how much can I push the limits with javascript alone? As in, no wasm.

[00:21:10] <onosendi> I'm having trouble highlighting a dynamic form field when there's an error. The problem is express-validator returns the index of the item. On the React side, I'm able to target the field by index, but the issue arrises when new fields are added/removed, as the index has changed. It would be nice to somehow get the id of the item in the validation result, something like `items[`id`].quantity`.

[00:47:36] <wroathe> dante443: Yes. It would be less important to do so with session storage.
[00:48:25] <wroathe> dante443: But in both cases you should seek to keep user data in storage for as little time as possible on the client.
[00:49:04] <dante443> What is the typical encryption method for client side encryption like this?
[00:49:20] <GreenJello> dante443, only if you're going to prompt the user for a decryption key / password
[00:50:01] <ljharb> dante443: don't do clientside encryption, period

[00:50:04] <jellobot> dante443, Don't try to do encryption or cryptography in browser JavaScript. https://web.archive.org/web/20150512024954/http://matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/
[00:50:31] <ljharb> dante443: if you can't trust an SSL cert with HSTS, you're 100% screwed anyways, since the attacker can control the encryption code itself
[00:50:53] <dante443> ljharb so you disagree with wroathe about storing data in sessionStorage with encryption?
[00:51:05] <ljharb> yes
[00:51:09] <ljharb> sessionStorage is fine
[00:51:13] <ljharb> "with encryption" is useless
[00:51:18] <wroathe> dante443: I said "less"
[00:51:21] <stenno> localstorage is still scoped for the origin
[00:51:28] <ljharb> i agree with wroathe that you should minimize how much time important data lives on the client tho

[00:56:18] <ljharb> yep
[00:56:27] <wroathe> stenno: Or a super l33t h@x0r kid could just see you accessing the site from a distance at the library and decide to have a seat after you leave and forget to log out, and the kid could just pop open the browser and open devtools
[00:56:46] <stenno> wroathe: yeah, can't prevent that
[00:56:55] <wroathe> stenno: No, the difference is that when they close the browser window the session is cleared
[00:57:02] <wroathe> stenno: Local storage persists
[00:57:17] <stenno> yeah but if they dont
[00:57:20] <wroathe> stenno: And when I say "forget to log out" I mean of the computer, and not the site
[00:57:27] <ljharb> cookies don't always clear on session end.
[00:57:48] <wroathe> Because presumably the library administrators have it set up to clear user profile data between logins in this scenario
[00:57:56] <wroathe> Which would fix that problem, if the user correctly logged out of the machine
[00:58:08] <wroathe> So the issue here is persistence duration
[00:58:22] <wroathe> Which is why I said that session storage is "less" of a concern, because it will be cleared when the browser window is closed
[00:58:41] <wroathe> Whereas local storage persists between browser sessions

[03:07:39] <wroathe> hans: That might be the worst thing on the internet.
[03:11:11] <hans> wroathe, well haven't seen anyone else make a better version (well there was one guy who made something similar in Python, https://github.com/josh-perry/pokemon-hm-slave-finder )
[03:12:09] <hans> but that one isn't exactly pretty either, "get_pokemon_from_raw_html.py
[03:12:09] <hans> " - and my version is way more convenient
[03:12:32] <wroathe> hans: Well, I told you how to make a better version yesterday. Pull down the machines and merge them into a single JSON file, and send a single request from the browser
[03:12:45] <wroathe> hans: The fact that that makes 1400 requests from my browser is unacceptable
[03:13:01] <wroathe> Or maybe it was the day before, I don't remember
[03:13:15] <hans> could do that.. but then i'd have to maintain it once a year xD
[03:13:33] <hans> hmm, or could i get Github Actions or something to maintain it for me? perhaps, not sure
[03:14:01] <wroathe> hans: You could literally just write a script that does the pull, merges it in, and then checks it in and pushes it
[03:14:09] <wroathe> hans: So once a year it'd be one single command

[06:31:38] <domhnall> wroathe: yeah, its on the fly code at top and example from docs at bottom
[06:31:54] <wroathe> And you're setting a filter property on it, but then expecting .each to be defined on it later
[06:32:07] <wroathe> Nowhere here are you importing lodash or underscore
[06:32:24] <domhnall> no need to import, its in npm package.json
[06:32:24] <xsznix> how are you running your javascript? in a browser? in node?
[06:32:29] <domhnall> node
[06:32:34] <domhnall> via Atom
[06:32:56] <domhnall> I think at first I didn't have my node setup correctly.
[06:33:01] <wroathe> domhnall: What makes you think you don't need to import lodash in node?
[06:33:15] <xsznix> have you tried adding this line at the top: const _ = require('lodash');
[06:33:29] <domhnall> wroathe: other than it doesn't complain... the docs have alternative options to usage.
[06:33:49] <domhnall> xsznix: no, didn't see that suggestion anywhere
[06:33:54] <wroathe> domhnall: Which docs are those?
[06:33:55] <domhnall> might be useful
[06:34:14] <domhnall> er, from the lodash and underscore sites
[06:34:24] <wroathe> domhnall: The lodash site explicitly says you must import it
[06:34:28] <wroathe> domhnall: And gives options for doing so
[06:35:17] <domhnall> I see
[06:35:45] <domhnall> so this must be underscore working then
[06:36:25] <xsznix> this is from 2019 but it summarizes importing modules in node pretty well: https://adrianmejia.com/getting-started-with-node-js-modules-require-exports-imports-npm-and-beyond/
[06:36:30] <wroathe> domhnall: Underscore also says you must import it
[06:36:42] <wroathe> domhnall: Can you point me to where you read that you don't need to import it?
[06:36:55] <domhnall> wroathe: hm, I don't doubt that... its just working now without importing. but will do
[06:37:19] <domhnall> wroathe: doesn't say I don't need to...I just didn't do it.
[06:37:33] <wroathe> domhnall: Well, if it's not documented behavior it shouldn't be relied upon.
[06:37:35] <domhnall> xsznix: thank you
[06:37:46] <wroathe> domhnall: Also, you'll want to prefer lodash over underscore.
[06:37:57] <domhnall> wroathe: yeah, I'm seeing that now
[06:38:25] <wroathe> domhnall: Underscore is the older, more limited, parent of lodash

[08:41:08] <ljharb> lind{at}yahoo: anyone who isn’t stuck in the Stone Age will use a bundler and be able to transform CJS to whatever they want

[08:50:09] <ljharb> lind{at}yahoo: to be clear: your TS can and should use import/export (ie, be authored in ESM)
[08:50:16] <GreenJello> lind{at}yahoo, the youtube thing needing a global function at a specific time is an outdated pattern that's not really compatible with native ESM support in the browser

[08:51:57] <GreenJello> and if included with a normal <script> it'll create a global

[08:52:33] <GreenJello> that won't work either, unless you're using a bundler, and then you have to expose it globally yourself or ask the bundler to do so

[17:12:22] <DPA> console.log handles those things nicely.
[17:13:18] <entuland> depending on the object that could be okay, but in complex cases with cyclic references or the alike you may want to implement the persistence yourself (if that's what you're after)

[19:06:02] <ljharb> it has less users, but that’s because on most channels, most users were people that haven’t participated in years, but their irc clients continue to connect

[21:41:54] <Intelo> ok..

[21:44:55] <teut> it does

[21:45:03] <ljharb> it really, really doesn't.
[21:45:03] <systemfault> Did I ever mentioned performance?
[21:45:07] <teut> java is bad agreed
[21:45:09] <Alexendoo> Faster doesn't mean you have to like it
[21:45:19] <teut> faster means you gotta use it

[21:45:27] <systemfault> Not sure where's the link...
[21:45:28] <ljharb> teut: ok so then systemfault didn't mention anything about perf, so how is "java is faster" relevant
[21:45:31] <ljharb> teut: no it doesn't.
[21:45:40] <l__q> how to use cli apps in javascript? I have stockfish in cli version and I want use it along with javascript, but how to call a cli program on unix (macos) and send commands?
[21:45:40] <l__q> in cli you run `stockfish` and then you can send commands, how do that in js? call cli app and then send commands. Not as -parameter, first call a cli app then send commands.
[21:45:41] <GreenJello> teut, there are faster languages than Java with better type systems, like Rust
[21:45:41] <ljharb> teut: and JS is incredibly fast for most use cases.
[21:45:45] <ljharb> ^
[21:45:47] <systemfault> ^
[21:45:48] <l__q> I dont want to use a `stockfish.js` becouse latest vesrion is 12 and I need version 14, and I want to learn how to call CLI app and then send and read outputs.
[21:45:56] <teut> i dont like java, I like c++ python
[21:46:11] <teut> i neither like js but , its a necessary evil
[21:46:23] <GreenJello> teut, but most of the time performance is limited by the actual code you write, not the max possible performance of a language
[21:46:27] <systemfault> If the only metric that matters is "performance", we'd all be writing C.
[21:46:44] <systemfault> Or even assembly..
[21:46:52] <teut> not only that GreenJello , it s also by optimizations by the compiler

[21:49:40] <l__q> Im thik is C not c++
[21:49:40] <GreenJello> l__q, depends on the program, but if it's a simple readline CLI, you can spawn a child process and write to its stdin

[23:57:47] <dante443> I have a race condition with useReducer. useReducer is dispatching a 'status' field and a 'data' field, and it seems the status field gets to the component quicker. I am testing for empty array with length > 0. Is useReducer a bad choice for this setup?
[23:57:57] <dante443> sheetjs remarkable2 is amazing
[23:59:06] <sheetjs> you have one?
[23:59:16] <dante443> Yes, I use it all the time
[23:59:42] <sheetjs> did you get a marker or marker plus?
