[00:02:52] <indigo> I feel like using a heap to solve this is going into esoteric territory
[00:02:58] <indigo> "hey let's use this just because we can"
[00:03:01] <Brekkjern> Yeah...
[00:03:08] <indigo> But then again the whole problem is esoteric :P
[00:03:58] <Brekkjern> Yep
[00:04:04] <pja> Bautista was great in BR2049. Looking forward to seeing him in Dune.
[00:04:17] <pja> More CS homework Brekkjern?
[00:04:19] <indigo> Good job on solving it though!
[00:04:23] <Brekkjern> pja: Yeah...
[00:04:35] <pja> Heaps, heaps. Heaps of Heaps.
[00:04:45] <Brekkjern> pja: Both Bautista and Skarsgård did an amazing job
[00:05:09] <Brekkjern> Jason Momoa didn't manage to ruin it too, so that's good :P
[00:05:13] <pja> CS teachers like heaps, but they’re mostly bad in the modern world I suspect. Not very cache friendly.
[00:05:42] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:05:57] <pja> Dune has such a great cast. Looking forward to seeing it next month...
[00:06:24] <Brekkjern> I bet implementations that work on a single array will be vastly superior to any implementation that uses a heap
[00:06:49] <Brekkjern> Even if it is way worse in big-o notation...
[00:07:26] <ngoldbaum> yeah sadly jason mamoa is a bad actor
[00:07:33] <ngoldbaum> he has presence though
[00:08:07] <Brekkjern> His role is OK in this movie, but I'm not sure I'd like him in the followups...
[00:08:46] <manicennui> Hot take: big O notation is garbage.
[00:08:57] <Brekkjern> That is a pretty tepid take in here...
[00:09:12] <ngoldbaum> if we get children of doom that would be a huge mistake
[00:09:30] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:09:36] <ngoldbaum> let’s just pretend frank herbert died after dune came out and the sequels didn’t happen
[00:09:51] <Brekkjern> I'm not convinced they will be making the sequels though
[00:09:59] <ngoldbaum> lmao the syfy miniseries versions of the dune books
[00:10:00] <Brekkjern> This isn't the fucking MCU
[00:10:02] <ngoldbaum> so bad
[00:13:33] <manicennui> Will almost certainly depend on how well it does.
[00:13:58] <pja> ngoldbaum: Are they going to do any of Dune Messiah?
[00:14:02] <manicennui> The latest covid spike will probably have died down by the time it releases in the US.
[00:14:05] <Brekkjern> Well, yes, but I also don't think Villeneuve wants to do a long series.
[00:14:26] <pja> Or are we just getting the hero’s story without the author’s followup that deliberately undercut that narrative?
[00:14:28] <manicennui> Brekkjern: https://www.slashfilm.com/595048/dune-sequel-ready-to-go-for-2022-if-greenlit-says-director-denis-villeneuve/
[00:14:28] <buttsbot> Dune Sequel 'Ready To Go' For 2022 If Greenlit, Says Director Denis Villeneuve
[00:14:32] <ngoldbaum> i hope they have the sense to end it at the end of dune and not try to hobbit this
[00:14:47] <manicennui> Filthy Hobbitses.
[00:14:51] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Yes, I know about the second movie, but we're talking about the second book and such
[00:14:56] <pja> Randomly watched Sicario last week, which I didn’t realiseaws another Villeneuve movie.
[00:14:57] <ngoldbaum> add evangeline lilly as a fremen lady that does something to pad the runtime
[00:15:00] <pja> Disturbing.
[00:15:11] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Oh, I thought you mean a sequel to the movie, period.
[00:15:27] <Brekkjern> Srsly, Dune does not need to add shit to pad time. There's already so much happening.
[00:15:51] <Brekkjern> I'm actually of the opinion that the pacing is a bit too fast in this movie
[00:15:51] <ngoldbaum> i’m not sure there’s enough for three movies
[00:16:01] <Brekkjern> There's easily enough
[00:16:11] <manicennui> LOTR is still the best franchise with 3+ movies in the last several decades.
[00:16:14] <Brekkjern> But now they have made the decision I think it's a bit late to do anything about it :P
[00:16:21] <ngoldbaum> there’s just not that much that happens after the time jump
[00:16:45] <pja> Paul kills everyone. The end.
[00:16:48] <Brekkjern> I'm not saying shit about anything that happens in this movie. Gotta go watch it for yourself :)
[00:17:04] <pja> (OK, just the odd billion people.)
[00:17:05] <manicennui> I'm surprised no one has tried to do a Culture franchise. I guess the problem is that the books aren't tightly related.
[00:17:21] <pja> The Culture is hard to relate to perhaps?
[00:17:27] <ngoldbaum> i’m not sure what a movie would look like
[00:17:35] <ngoldbaum> a player of games movie would be boring
[00:17:44] <ngoldbaum> and that’s the most accessible one
[00:17:51] <pja> How do you establish the stakes?
[00:18:00] <pja> Would need a really good writer.
[00:18:14] <manicennui> Consider Phlebas would make a good SW-style movie.
[00:18:14] <pja> Didn’t Amazon have the rights at one point, but the family pulled the project?
[00:18:16] <Brekkjern> I haven't read much of The Culture series. I need to...
[00:18:29] <ngoldbaum> excession might work but it would be weird and confusing and hard to communicate all the context without a narrator
[00:18:53] <ngoldbaum> yeah a tv show would be easier, more time to do exposition dumps
[00:18:56] <manicennui> I think the SW model is the one they would need to use, but the problem is establishing the base.
[00:19:01] <pja> There’s a Dr Who book which is basically Dr Who meets the Culture.
[00:19:05] <manicennui> Just a bunch of stories set in the same universe.
[00:19:08] <Brekkjern> Only book I've read in the series is Surface Detail
[00:19:11] <riv> you hear they are doing Foundation? im so hyped
[00:19:19] <Brekkjern> I think that story could work as a movie though
[00:19:26] <ngoldbaum> an algebraist movie might be interesting
[00:19:32] <manicennui> riv: I just imagine that one will be more "inspired by" than anything.
[00:19:34] <ngoldbaum> but that’s not the culture
[00:21:56] <pja> I’m not hopefuly for Foundation. Suspect they’re going to miss the point.
[00:22:25] <pja> The Algebraist is nicely self-contained & has a decent charactor arc.
[00:23:19] <manicennui> It's kind of sad that the best way to "make it" these days as an author is to have your work adapted.
[00:23:57] <manicennui> So many works are being optioned.
[00:24:55] <pja> manicennui: Don’t knock it.
[00:24:59] <pja> We all have to eat.
[00:25:07] <manicennui> I'm not blaming the author at all.
[00:25:35] <manicennui> But I'll refrain from my rant about the holders of capital making all of the money on the backs of creative people.
[00:26:45] <Brekkjern> I'm happy that they are adapting stuff that hasn't really had a shot yet though
[00:27:15] <Brekkjern> I mean, there's been so many remakes the last few years. It's a bit boring.
[00:27:19] <Brekkjern> Either remakes or franchises.
[00:27:43] <pja> manicennui: It’s the same for journalism I’m told - what’s feeding a lot of long-form journalism right now is that decent work can get optioned for a film.

[00:27:46] <buttsbot> 125+ Books Becoming TV Series We Cannot Wait to See << Rotten Tomatoes – Movie and TV News
[00:28:22] <pja> (You’d think for factual stuff you wouldn’t need to pay a journalist for rights to their article, but I’ve read that it’S what happens.)
[00:28:42] <manicennui> Probably worth it because they've done all the research.
[00:28:47] <pja> streaming services must have gone out & bid up every franchise out there.
[00:28:49] <manicennui> And they don't actually pay that much.
[00:29:02] <manicennui> Even if you write the screenplay you don't make that much.
[00:29:12] <pja> manicennui: It’s a lot more that the journalism itself pays apparently.
[00:29:18] <manicennui> Yeah, I don't doubt that.
[00:29:31] <manicennui> But that's because we pay the people who are actually important in society barely enough to live.
[00:29:46] <manicennui> So the heads of the studios/companies can make more.
[00:30:01] <manicennui> And the 15 levels of administration between them and the creator.
[00:31:36] <dimadima> shadow banning - losing strategy?
[00:31:58] <Brekkjern> Que?
[00:32:08] <dimadima> i'm trying to figure out how to address the problem of spammers w/o creating an invite system
[00:32:27] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(series)#Television_series_adaptation
[00:32:27] <buttsbot> Silo (series) - Wikipedia
[00:32:34] <manicennui> Well, guess I will have to get Apple+.
[00:32:42] <dimadima> Brekkjern: i've kinda launched a messaing platform and it's already attacting some spammers
[00:33:04] <Brekkjern> dimadima: 1-to-1 or 1-to-many?
[00:33:11] <dimadima> 1-to-many :(
[00:33:41] <manicennui> dimadima: Engage a hitman.
[00:33:43] <Brekkjern> Shadow banning could work, but it's easier for the spammers to know that they are being blocked
[00:34:06] <dimadima> manicennui: that's my instinct but i want to succeed in life and not end up in jail :(
[00:34:10] <Brekkjern> Alternatively you could aggressively rate limit them
[00:34:42] <pja> I didn’t like Wool all that much, but it’s a great setting.
[00:34:44] <Brekkjern> There's something... A social network platform where every post requires a blood sacrifice :P
[00:34:44] <dimadima> Brekkjern: i figure spammers have no soul so the longer you keep them thinking they are spamming, the better? if you openly block them, they'll make new accounts?
[00:34:46] <manicennui> dimadima: Pay off the police.
[00:34:53] <manicennui> pja: I loved the entire series.
[00:35:03] <Brekkjern> dimadima: Yeah. Make them work for it :P
[00:35:07] <pja> I kind of bounced off it.
[00:35:18] <pja> Don’t think I read the sequel (Dust?)
[00:35:39] <manicennui> Good news: Another Dan Brown movies is being adapted.
[00:35:41] <Brekkjern> 100% solutions are impossible. Just keep them working for it.
[00:35:55] <dimadima> Brekkjern: this spammer is crazy
[00:35:58] <riv> is that good?
[00:36:06] <manicennui> "What We Know So Far: Manhattan and A Teacher’s Ashley Zukerman — pictured, center, in a first-look image from the series — stars as famed Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon. In the series, he must solve various puzzles to save his kidnapped mentor and thwart a chilling global conspiracy."
[00:36:10] <dimadima> his spam is a link shortener scheme that allegedly pays you to shorten links
[00:36:17] <dimadima> so he's sending ppl links shortened with this link shortener
[00:36:35] <manicennui> riv: I was being sarcastic actually.
[00:36:36] <dimadima> he or she or they, no idea actaully
[00:36:49] <Brekkjern> If they are spamming via DM's then shadowbanning is a decent solution
[00:37:25] <dimadima> Brekkjern: they're all DMs, it's a messenger. some accounts are "closed" meaning a friend request type thing is required to contact them. but some people have "open" accounts that you can just message
[00:37:25] <Brekkjern> Also it should be easy to detect that someone is sending messages to a lot of different users within a short period of time, so you can apply it automatically.
[00:37:33] <manicennui> Dan Brown is like the poor man's Umberto Eco.
[00:37:33] <indigo> But what if they are spamming via... IDM
[00:37:43] <dimadima> Brekkjern: this person literally spammed me lol
[00:37:46] * indigo plays some Boards of Canada
[00:37:50] <dimadima> by repsonding to the welcome message
[00:37:56] <dimadima> and then a lot of other ppl
[00:37:58] <riv> manicennui, i wasn't sure -i know his books are kinda trashy but maybe a film version could be good if creative liberties were taken. I have no idea if they've made some already
[00:38:14] <dimadima> makes me wonder what their, uh, intelligence level is or something
[00:38:15] <manicennui> riv: They have. He was huge for a while.
[00:38:17] <manicennui> Tom Hanks was in them.
[00:38:28] <manicennui> They adapted DaVinci Code and one or two of its sequels.
[00:39:02] <manicennui> Dawn by Octavia Butler is being adapted. That is actually good news.
[00:39:10] <manicennui> She is finally starting to be recognized it seems.
[00:39:15] <manicennui> A few of her works are being adapted.
[00:40:28] <dimadima> when did lobsters go invite only?
[00:41:01] <indigo> Wasn't Lobsters always invite only?

[00:41:51] <riv> oh
[00:42:12] <riv> do you know a good site that gives movie recs? based on me putting in what i've watched + ratings or something
[00:42:25] <Brekkjern> riv: I've had luck with Taste.io
[00:42:35] <riv> (or alternative good ways to find films)
[00:42:38] <riv> i will try it!
[00:43:03] <manicennui> I tend to start with a film I like, and then look at the "customers also watched" on various sites.
[00:43:08] <Brekkjern> It even has functionality to recommend a movie based on the profile of another person you are watching with
[00:43:37] <manicennui> I have far too many movies on my list of things to watch though.
[00:44:26] <dimadima> indigo: no idea, i only looked into registering a few months ago and it was already invite-only
[00:45:33] <Brekkjern> dimadima: I think it has always been invite only.
[00:46:06] <dimadima> i see thank you
[00:46:28] <manicennui> Showtime is adapting Let The Right One In again.
[00:46:38] <manicennui> As a series this time.
[00:48:57] <pja> The film was pretty good.
[00:49:39] <pja> riv: Try justwatch.com
[00:49:52] <pja> They at least try to give recommendations.
[00:50:10] <gwozniak> I quite liked both versions of the movie.  I'll wait and see if a series will appeal to me
[00:50:22] <Brekkjern> I haven't seen it
[00:50:34] <Brekkjern> I should probably do that. I've heard good things.
[00:50:37] <gwozniak> dimadima: yeah, invites are one of the defining features of Lobsters
[00:50:54] <riv> cheers!
[00:51:22] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: The other is a fascination for antiquated computers, BSD's and Rust.
[00:51:48] <dimadima> gwozniak: and it still doesn't totally keep spammers out ey
[00:51:53] <Brekkjern> s/fascination/unhealthy obsession/
[00:52:00] <gwozniak> No, but it's better than without
[00:52:34] <Brekkjern> dimadima: No one feature will do it all. Invitaion + long cooldown before you can post + moderation + banned domains, etc
[00:52:36] <dimadima> i'll always wonder whether i should have gone invites. from the spam perspective and from the business perspective
[00:53:28] <dimadima> Brekkjern: yeah makes sense
[00:53:34] <dimadima> i think i'll go with shadow banning for now
[00:54:01] <Brekkjern> You can automagically apply shadow bans on people who DM a lot of different users in a short amount of time too
[00:54:02] <dimadima> i mean, my first approach was messaing this person politely and asking them to stop. but i don't anticipate that'll work
[00:54:36] <Brekkjern> People who aren't interacting with your community in good faith are not going to care what you ask them to do
[00:54:46] <dimadima> i suspect, but you never know
[00:54:59] <dimadima> sometimes there's a facelessness on the Internet that turns people into shit
[00:55:02] <Brekkjern> "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know I wasn't supposed to be spamming my ad-riddled links to get revenue. I'll stop." :P
[00:55:04] <dimadima> and maybe if you show some humanity...
[00:55:38] <dimadima> Brekkjern: yeah i suspect that'll be the case heh
[00:55:47] <dimadima> hence my anxiety and building this (shadow?) banning now
[00:55:53] <dimadima> in anticipation

[01:50:39] <manicennui> I found that one packet was okay for 32 oz of water, but two packets is a bit much.
[01:50:39] <riv> huh false lemon is a thing you can buy on amazon
[01:53:41] <quanticle> Is it an edible product? Because when I think of "false lemon" I think of those wax fruits that they use for decoration.

[19:32:48] <cb> llvm is written in sepples guys
[19:32:51] <cb> we can't have that
[19:32:57] <gwozniak> Which will be great once the Arm SoCs get more popular
[19:33:02] <cb> or risc-v...
[19:33:05] <gwozniak> Yup
[19:33:27] <gwozniak> and you realize that making a compiler that targets multiple archs is, in fact, pretty fucking complicated
[19:33:42] <gerikson> ``chibicc is yet another small C compiler that implements most C11 features.''
[19:33:48] <gerikson> "most"
[19:34:45] <gwozniak> Duddits!
[19:36:07] <gwozniak> Going to Toronto for a team lunch (outside)
[19:36:31] <gerikson> omg
[19:37:45] <gwozniak> I should really look at the codegen for one of these simple compilers some day
[19:37:51] <gwozniak> But, today is not that day
[19:38:46] <gerikson> shoemaker's kids don't get C compilers
[19:38:56] <gerikson> ok that doesn't make sense
[19:47:41] <gerikson> ironically I e-know people who'd love that shit , btu the irony is they are fanatical GPLers
[19:48:57] <gerikson> that person is currently trying to make a frame-buffer only experience because X11 is tainted

[20:42:09] <indigo> What's the state of the Linux desktop again? X11 is bad, and Wayland is worse
[20:46:59] <manicennui> I don't know why people even focus on those things.
[20:47:22] <manicennui> IMHO the biggest problem is config.
[20:47:42] <manicennui> Attempting to get everything even looking somewhat similar means configuring several frameworks/libraries.
[20:48:02] <manicennui> And really basic things like changing mouse/trackpad settings might be done in one of half a dozen ways.
[20:48:29] <manicennui> This is kind of why a minimal Gnome install still seems to be best.
[20:48:45] <manicennui> GTK is heavily used, and there are halfway decent config tools.
[20:48:46] <cb> gwozniak: i'm in hell
[20:48:47] <cb> (gdb) p *_Errno()
[20:48:47] <cb> Cannot access memory at address 0xffffffffffffffe0
[20:49:01] <indigo> Yeah I like for things to be opinionated
[20:49:08] <indigo> manicennui: No love for KDE?
[20:49:21] <cb> kde has no opinions other than to pass the buck
[20:49:27] <manicennui> indigo: Far fewer apps use KDE's libraries.
[20:49:33] <indigo> cb: If you say the address out loud, the GDB boogieman will come for you
[20:50:02] <manicennui> If you configure GTK, far more apps will be taken care of.
[20:50:28] <manicennui> I suppose you could try really hard to use KDE apps.
[20:50:31] <indigo> IMO GNOME jumped the shark after 2
[20:50:42] <manicennui> I don't have problems with 3.
[20:50:54] <indigo> Same here, but I always thought that 2 was better
[20:51:01] <manicennui> I basically only use it to launch apps.
[20:51:08] <manicennui> Super key, type, enter.
[20:51:32] <cb> i kinda like gnome 3
[20:51:35] <manicennui> Window management is what it is without a tiling window manager, but there are some tiling add-ons for Gnome.
[20:52:00] <manicennui> Gnome 3 on my desktop is faster than Windows.
[20:52:03] <indigo> I like stacking but with the option of tiling
[20:52:21] <indigo> Eg. press a key combo to move a window to 50% left, or 25% top left corner, etc
[20:52:37] <manicennui> The second set of problems with Linux on the desktop are all related to running Linux on laptops, which is still subpar.
[20:53:30] <manicennui> I have a Dell XPS 13 with Ubuntu pre-installed. Battery life and the trackpad are a joke.
[20:54:03] <indigo> IMO Macbooks still remain the best laptop experience
[20:54:04] <Brekkjern> Best way to get Linux on your desktop is as WSL
[20:54:04] <buttsbot> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.
[20:54:09] <manicennui> indigo: Absolutely.
[20:54:17] <manicennui> Brekkjern: No it isn't.
[20:54:25] <dmc[m]> https://i.redd.it/0z07yh7ds1o71.png
[20:54:53] <dasm> dmc[m]: xD
[20:55:21] <manicennui> There just isn't any reason to run any Linux desktop software.
[20:55:22] <buttsbot> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.
[20:55:37] <manicennui> Tiling window managers are the only argument I can see.
[20:55:48] <indigo> Join us now and share the software; You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.
[20:55:55] <manicennui> Which leaves CLI stuff, which you don't need WSL for.
[20:56:20] <manicennui> WSL felt just like running Linux in a VM to me, which it basically is.
[20:56:27] <indigo> It's a very nice VM
[20:56:41] <manicennui> And on a Mac, I don't even need actual Linux half the time.
[20:56:43] <indigo> Sadly running WSL2 also runs Windows in a VM
[20:56:49] <manicennui> OS X is Unixy enough in many cases.
[20:56:56] <indigo> And there is a slight performance impact
[20:57:09] <manicennui> Running Windows is always a slight performance impact.
[20:57:36] <manicennui> I'm very tempted to just get rid of Windows on my desktop and rely on the many, many games that run on Linux at this point.
[20:59:39] <indigo> Go for it! I can't get rid of Windows because of Ableton Live and Apex Legends
[20:59:56] <manicennui> I only play Overwatch now, but I mostly don't enjoy it.
[21:00:04] <manicennui> It's more of a habit than something I truly enjoy.
[21:00:10] <manicennui> Like once per week I'll have a really fun game.
[21:07:10] <manicennui> Several years from now I'm going to be really upset when the cats I follow on Twitter pass away.
[21:07:21] <manicennui> I already experienced this once with a comic creator I follow.
[21:13:24] <companion_cube> gerikson: what is X11 tainted by? First time i hear that :D

[22:14:36] <manicennui> The last movie will be on Netflix next month.

[22:19:28] <manicennui> What is this person talking about?
[22:20:06] <manicennui> I can only imagine that they are referring to a "city" that is really like 500k people or something.
[22:21:08] <manicennui> Uber and public transportation have gotten a little worse in Chicago, but delivery services became huge.
[22:21:33] <manicennui> And I can still walk to the grocery store, restaurants, etc.
[22:21:53] <manicennui> Some restaurants went out of business, but I still have dozens of options within a short walk.
[22:23:43] <wrl> what i really missed during the pandemic was just being in a city that was alive
[22:23:53] <wrl> and now that the fog has been lifting a bit, i've been biking around more
[22:23:53] <gerikson> manicennui: lockdowns
[22:24:01] <wrl> and just... appreciating the city i live in more
[22:24:24] <manicennui> gerikson: Which didn't affect delivery services here, and grocery stores were still open, and many restaurants switched to pick-up and delivery.
[22:24:40] <manicennui> wrl: I can see that, but I don't think the pandemic destroyed urbanism.
[22:24:58] <wrl> no absolutely not
[22:25:10] <wrl> if anything is destroying urbanism, it's the international housing crisis
[22:25:18] <wrl> rents keep going up, private investment keeps snapping up units
[22:25:29] <manicennui> These people are either discussing cities that weren't that great or dense before the pandemic, or they are the suburbanites who move to the city and then want it to become the suburbs and buy a car and drive everywhere.
[22:25:41] <manicennui> Yeah, all they build here is luxury rentals.
[22:25:49] <gerikson> concern trolling
[22:25:54] <manicennui> And the older builders get gut rehabbed.

[22:27:40] <manicennui> I don't know whether the situation is much better since I was there over a decade ago, but SF didn't really seem that great as far as public transportation goes. It was just far better than most American cities.
[22:28:06] <manicennui> The main routes were covered, but there were large swaths with no good options.
[22:28:15] <manicennui> Here there is a bus just about every half mile at least.
[22:28:22] <manicennui> Running along the grid.
[22:29:02] <manicennui> And most of the routes aren't insane like the SF bus routes.
[22:29:30] <manicennui> The buses here are usually mostly east/west or north/south.
[22:29:37] <manicennui> So it's harder to get on the wrong way.
[22:29:46] <manicennui> As long as you know the general direction you want to go.

[23:34:17] <manicennui> dimadima: Do hydraulics scare you?
[23:34:26] <bkero> Mortal Engines?
[23:34:31] <Brekkjern> If you aren't scared of hydraulics, then you are dumb...
[23:34:45] <manicennui> Why would I be scared of them?
[23:34:48] <dimadima> manicennui: fwiw i do like to stay as close to the ground as possible unless there's a good reason
[23:35:02] <manicennui> Being afraid of them is different from not acting like an idiot around them.
[23:35:17] <dimadima> but no i'm not particularly afraid of elevators
[23:35:43] <Brekkjern> It's not like I have a phobia of just something that runs on hydraulics, but it's one of those things that you just avoid fucking with unless you know EXACTLY what you are doing.
[23:35:55] <Brekkjern> Same thing with electricity.
[23:36:38] <dimadima> yeah i'm in the same boat
[23:36:58] <dimadima> science is powerful
[23:37:12] <dimadima> forklifts are terrifying for example
[23:37:19] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[23:38:35] <dimadima> i wish they'd show more gore in high school
[23:38:39] <dimadima> or any gore, for that matter
[23:38:45] <dimadima> i would have been a lot less reckless
[23:39:05] <Brekkjern> "This is what happens if you stick your hand into a gearbox while it's running. Don't do that."
[23:39:06] <dimadima> there was a cliche that in drivers' education they would show you car accident scenes and shit
[23:39:13] <dimadima> but i never got any of that
[23:39:28] <dimadima> or any kind of belt
[23:39:36] <dimadima> stay away from belts even if they're not on right this second
[23:40:18] <dimadima> it's hard to appreciate how soft and fragile the human body is w/o seeing what happens when shit goes wrong
[23:40:24] <manicennui> Now we have reality shows to show us that many people in physical jobs are kind of idiots and do dangerous shit.
[23:40:53] <dimadima> yeh kind of the opposite
[23:40:59] <manicennui> I also worked a bunch of physical labor jobs after high school and saw some of it first hand.

[23:44:17] <riv> O_O
[23:44:19] <riv> how?
[23:45:20] <manicennui> So imagine a loading dock with two huge depressed areas for dumpsters outside.
[23:45:39] <manicennui> Basically you could walk out the dock onto a cement pier and be at the same level as the top of the dumpsters.
[23:46:11] <manicennui> We had giant boxes (maybe 6' x 6') that we'd fill with packaging and other garbage as we worked.
[23:46:37] <manicennui> To empty them, two people would stand with one foot on the pier and one foot on the edge of the dumpster and tip the giant box so everything dumped out of it.
[23:47:00] <manicennui> It was icy, and his foot on the dumpster slipped. He hit his side on the dumpster, then fell to the ground next to the dumpster.
[23:50:04] <dmc> lol
[23:51:15] <riv> AAAAA
[23:51:27] <manicennui> I believe they said someone on a forklift had hit a water pipe before and flooded the warehouse.
[23:51:31] <manicennui> I wasn't there for that.
[23:51:48] <manicennui> Definitely saw a lot of damage to items from forklifts.
[23:55:38] <manicennui> Watching Violet Evergarden makes me think we should all send more letters.
[23:56:06] <dimadima> yeah forklift are fucked
[23:56:10] <dimadima> what's violet evergarden
[23:56:17] <manicennui> Anime
[23:56:21] <dimadima> i guess that's a google
[23:56:22] <dimadima> ah
[23:56:25] <dimadima> they write letters in that?
[23:58:28] <manicennui> Without giving anything away, it is about Violet, who fought in a war, coming home and trying to figure out what to do. She becomes an "auto memories doll". They write letters and other things for clients. Set in a time before computers and such.
[23:58:32] <manicennui> Whole setting is fictional.
[23:59:30] <dimadima> ah cool. yeah i also wish there was more letter writing but alas, computers
[23:59:58] <dimadima> the messenger i'm going to launch soon is a non-instant messenger that i'm hoping will give people a way to do that sort of thing online
