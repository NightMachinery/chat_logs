[00:39:22] <jcbjoe2021> Im used to gparted for erasing a disk and labeling it. I would like to use the terminal. Should I dd the disk let's say to exfat then label with exfat label tool?
[00:40:34] <sney> 'dd to exfat' doesn't make sense
[00:41:07] <greycat> exfat is a file system type
[00:41:23] <jcbjoe2021> sney: i probably said it wrong
[00:41:32] <sney> use wipefs to erase the partition table, use fdisk or parted to make a new one and create a partition, then use mkfs.exfat to create the exfat filesystem on the partition
[00:41:35] <sney> dd is not involved here
[00:41:43] <sney> and the wipefs step is technically optional
[00:42:07] <jcbjoe2021> Ok
[00:42:28] <greycat> if you use dd to copy a partition, you will be copying the *entire* partition, including the file system's metadata, fragmented files, corruption, etc.
[00:42:48] <tomreyn> there are separate utilities for partitioning, creating and configuring intermediate layers such as LVM, MD, DM, and for creating file systems
[00:44:50] <tomreyn> fdisk is probably going to work well for partitioning (and flagging and labeling partitions, which is optional). for creating an exfat file system, there is probably mkfs.exfat

[00:45:23] <sney> I think parted is the recommended tool nowadays but my muscle memory prefers fdisk

[08:25:07] <somiaj> you can try to clean up space. If it is just the downloads take up to much space, you can link /var/cache/apt/archives to another location you do have space for the download
[08:29:12] <yanmaani> hmm, seems like I have a lot of old kernels
[08:29:18] <yanmaani> how do you remove those safely again?
[08:29:29] <somiaj> just use apt

[13:57:39] <MaxFrames> hello. I'm having a hard time identifying a device (probably a printer) on a remote site, which is online, has ports 22,23,80 and 443 listening, but won't accept connections on any of those
[13:57:57] <MaxFrames> I've already ruled out firewall issues (unless there is a firewall on the machine itself, which is a possibility)
[13:58:41] <MaxFrames> I'm trying to figure out what the device is using curl, but curl gives an SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL error upon attempting the connection
[13:59:17] <MaxFrames> I thought it may be because the device is using a deprecated version of TLS, so I tried this workaround: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1250787/when-i-try-to-curl-a-website-i-get-ssl-error
[13:59:30] <MaxFrames> but the result is the same: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL
[13:59:35] <Khepra> MaxFrames: and port 80 without ssl is not responding?
[13:59:40] *** Quits: JohnML (~JohnML@ip-37-201-129-30.hsi13.unitymediagroup.de) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:59:54] <MaxFrames> at the same time any SSH or telnet or http/80 connection attempt is denied instantly
[14:00:07] <Khepra> denied how?
[14:00:37] <MaxFrames> curling http gives this: "curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer"
[14:00:50] <MaxFrames> I'm thinking: firewall on the device
[14:00:55] <Khepra> MaxFrames: what about ssh and ftp?
[14:01:31] *** Joins: JohnML (~JohnML@ip-37-201-129-30.hsi13.unitymediagroup.de)
[14:01:36] <Khepra> oh sorry you said 23 not 21. well anyway, what about ssh?
[14:02:25] <MaxFrames> "ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host"
[14:02:47] *** Quits: eht (~eht@user/eht) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[14:02:48] <MaxFrames> some HP printers did have a firewall of sorts which you could enable in the firmware
[14:03:02] <MaxFrames> it seems the device is accepting connections, but denying access
[14:03:21] <Khepra> well then at this point I'm not sure this is a debian issue in any way. if there's nothing listening, or is but is closing connection, nothing you can do about it on the client side
[14:03:23] <MaxFrames> i.e. I can reach it on the ports, it does not time out
[14:03:34] *** Joins: eht (~eht@user/eht)
[14:03:43] <kline> MaxFrames, can you firewall it from the network?
[14:03:48] <MaxFrames> ok, just wanted to make sure I had tried every trick to get this device to tell me what it is
[14:04:15] <Khepra> MaxFrames: you can use openssl s_client to inspect the TLS thingy. If it's SSLv3, you'll need an older debian to try that out, or rebuild openssl with SSLv3 enabled
[14:04:28] <MaxFrames> kline: my device has full admin access to that remote network; to see if I can access the device from the LAN I'd need to be there
[14:04:43] <Khepra> I don't remember when v3 was dropped... stretch or before that maybe
[14:04:51] <kline> MaxFrames, heres my tip: firewall it off from the network completely, see who calls in to IT to complain
[14:04:54] <MaxFrames> might as well try
[14:05:18] <Khepra> that's actually a useful debug method. shut it out, see who phones in.
[14:05:20] <MaxFrames> kline: trouble is, the device is prolly a printer so it's being used within that lan
[14:05:32] <kline> yes, its important that its used
[14:05:40] *** Joins: Anasko (~Anasko@user/wikiwide)
[14:05:43] <kline> if its not used, nobody will complain that its unavailable
[14:05:58] <MaxFrames> but I can't firewall it... unless.... I can try to identify the lan port and disable it on the switch. good idea
[14:06:12] <Khepra> meaning there's a dead, unused, but powered up printer somewhere in the complex.  my OCD would go berserk on that one :)
[14:06:13] <MaxFrames> just need the mac address
[14:06:30] <MaxFrames> Khepra: indeed, I think that is the case
[14:06:32] <kline> firewall it off, when someone phones in, ask them to go to it and read the serial, model number, etc, then thank them for this information that allows you to "fix" it
[14:07:06] <kline> free remote hands
[14:07:20] <kline> and you can say you're doing your due diligence on unknown devices on the network at the same time

[14:43:05] <MaxFrames> I'm beginning to question my sanity. I've tracked down the device to a certain switch (the main building switch "sees" it on port 26 which is the uplink to switch 6) but I can't find the mac address on switch 6 at all....
[14:43:45] <Bushmaster> howdy folks, may be not the right place to ask, but what happened is, my internet was out of connection, but now its back, i had ports open, for external port 80, for internal, do i need port opening for 5 computers port 22?
[14:44:00] <Bushmaster> now all the ports are gone

[15:03:37] <Bushmaster> randall,  well, i just realized in home network, i do not need to open port 22 at all
[15:03:40] <Bushmaster> i did not know that
[15:04:16] <Bushmaster> now outside of home network, for all my Debian servers, I will need to open port 80 and port 443 for my Debian based Apache Server
[15:04:28] <randall> !context
[15:04:28] <dpkg> Try to give enough context! For example, let us know which command/program you are running, what you expected, and what you got instead. Try to be as specific as possible. If your command produced output, share the complete command (with all parameters!) and its output on https://paste.debian.net.
[15:04:41] <Bushmaster> what happened was my internet connection was out of order, but they have fixed it, now all the port I added before is gone
[15:04:53] <MaxFrames> bingo. it was switch 6 itself. someone had configured an IP address on one of the vlans, which is not used for management

[18:56:59] <randall> OliPicard: As long as you're running Debian stable, you can ask any support question here.
[18:59:10] <OliPicard> Super! So I am running Debian Buster server that’s running KVM. I have setup a bridge network that worked really well my VM’s could get to the internet. I then decided I wanted to add an additional IP address and made it a static route so one of my VM’s is fully exposed to the internet. I have a MAC address configured via DCHP but still I’m having problems with configuring the network. Here’s my current config

[23:16:36] <R0b0t1> hmm
[23:16:38] <R0b0t1> I'm not sure
[23:16:48] <R0b0t1> usually you would use an opengl tracing tool

[23:17:10] <R0b0t1> also, sometimes it is poor performance on the cpu leading to poor render performance as well, not just an IO throughput thing but poor multitasking or what have you
[23:17:20] <R0b0t1> you can definitely check utilization
[23:17:42] <R0b0t1> so if you have high utilization but poor perf your card prolly just can't do what you're asking it to -- which could mean unoptimal opengl
[23:17:49] <R0b0t1> if you have low utilization and poor perf -- cpu issue
[23:19:22] <PerfDave> Tweaking graphics options seems to make a huge difference, so I'm assuming it's literally one shader or something that's weird.

[23:31:44] <Khepra> R0b0t1: what kind of franken things do you have there?
[23:34:41] <R0b0t1> Khepra: Not really anything too bad, bookworm but accidentally installed sid on top of it because I messed up my package priorities
[23:34:56] <R0b0t1> this computer has an onboard BMC that emulates a VGA adapater but it's locked to 1024x768
[23:35:01] <R0b0t1> so anyway, I know my graphics stack works
[23:35:12] <R0b0t1> plasma is up just really low res
[23:35:41] <R0b0t1> it's the amdgpu driver that is definitely failing
