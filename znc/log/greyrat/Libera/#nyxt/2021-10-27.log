[04:22:45] <jmercouris> As long as it is “supported” by cl-cffi-GTK it should be ok
[04:23:44] <jmercouris> I wish I knew more about GTK to comment on potential version mismatches and incompatibility
[04:29:47] <waleee> I decided to check cl-webkit's test-suite again, but commenting out the function-tests that looked like they took some time before. Spoiler: they must have hanged, about 44 other tests fail on clearlinux
[04:31:49] <waleee> lots of :UNDEFINED for various js data type-related functionality
[04:34:40] <waleee> eg.  (webkit:make-jsc-class (nil "Empty" context) evaluates to #<CL-WEBKIT2:JSC-VALUE undefined: UNDEFINED>
[04:59:03] <jmercouris> Hm that’s no good
[04:59:13] <jmercouris> Maybe it is loading the wrong shared library
[04:59:21] <jmercouris> I can’t think they changed the API that much

[05:28:27] <jmercouris> I just didn't load it properly
[05:28:31] <jmercouris> 85 checks passed

[19:03:32] <jmercouris> Why would they be for sale there?
[19:03:56] <jmercouris> My favorite memory from Malmö was seeing chickens at the bus stop

[19:05:43] <jmercouris> They went “bock bock bock”

[19:06:03] <jmercouris> Oh I see
[19:06:13] <jmercouris> That makes sense
[19:06:31] <jmercouris> I didn’t realize that was considered a city
[19:06:41] <jmercouris> Maybe I’m getting confused
[19:06:47] <jmercouris> Im think of trellleborg
[19:06:55] <jmercouris> Malmö is indeed a city
[19:07:34] <jmercouris> No chickens at the bus stop in Malmö
[19:07:55] <jmercouris> What amazed me is that in Trelleborg people just left their bicycles unlocked all over the town

[22:05:26] <waleee> jmercouris: success. Something in the gi-gtk renderer, the old gtk one works
[22:06:06] <jmercouris> AHA
[22:06:13] <jmercouris> well you can just use the GTK renderer
[22:06:22] <jmercouris> it contains no practical improvements for you if it doesn't work
[22:06:28] <jmercouris> now, the only caveat is that dialogs may freeze your machine
[22:06:39] <jmercouris> BUT if you use the Nyxt specific dialogs, you should be OK
[22:06:47] <jmercouris> for example, for file selection, download path, etc
[22:09:34] <jmercouris> speaking of which, that reminds me, I wanted to help that user with automatically querying the download path
[22:11:28] <waleee> hm https://github.com/andy128k/cl-gobject-introspection/issues/78 something similar to this could cause intresting behaviour I guess
[22:13:40] <jmercouris> hm, perhaps
[22:13:49] <jmercouris> I have a feeling it has to do with some arbitrary nonsense
[22:13:59] <jmercouris> if you look at the gi-gtk renderer you see it is completely nonsensical that it changes things
[22:14:10] <jmercouris> it is just a magical incantation that I discovered whle implementing a pure GI renderer
[22:14:46] <jmercouris> it must have something to do with magic variables/state that must be set when creating a GTK program
