[10:35:59] <Fiji_> wtf
[10:36:40] <tammy> yeah, this is the year of toys.
[10:36:52] <tammy> so hopefully they last me a few years. laff
[10:37:15] <tammy> I've been rocking 2 gtx970's in sli for what feels like forever now.
[10:37:28] <tammy> and this array had been around for over 5 years now.
[10:37:52] <Fiji_> any drive failures?
[10:38:09] <tammy> so I got my money's worth from it. but disks are starting to fail and zfs is giving me issues removing a degraded disk from the pool and I've not troubleshot it properly yet.
[10:38:16] <Fiji_> ouch
[10:38:48] <Fiji_> i dont think ive ever used the past tense of "troubleshoot" like that
[10:39:05] <Fiji_> i always use it like "havent gotten around to troubleshooting it yet"
[10:39:24] <tammy> 2 disk started reporting errors so I've replaced 1, flawless victory. but the second one... I must be doing something wrong cause I can't remove the old disk that's been resilvered on a replacement from the pool for some reason, then when I reboot it starts the resilvering process all over again
[10:39:46] <Fiji_> if you used a gold drive you wouldnt need to resilver it

[23:18:07] <evilgohan2> [11:01:04] <ThePendulum> yeah they still think he can win the next election
[23:18:32] <evilgohan2> Don't put it past it to be possible. He came damn close this time around, and that's *after* winning in 2016 when no one thought he would even be the nominee.

[23:20:05] <Fiji_> i dont know if i see a path to win for him save biden dying or being hospitalized before the next election
[23:20:16] <Fiji_> i do see a path to him getting close though. he was pretty close with the EC this time
[23:22:42] <ThePendulum> does the next election have to be against a republican or can it be against another democrat?
[23:23:13] <ThePendulum> don't get the idea Biden has even remotely the momentum Obama did
