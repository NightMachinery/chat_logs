[03:37:45] <Square> "Break the emulsion" is probably the term im looking for. Saw it mentioned a couple of times in the recipe for Bearnaise sauce.
[03:40:32] <darsie> Milk is an emulsion.
[03:51:08] <pinkie> is breast milk correct to fit in this situation?
[03:55:13] *** Quits: Everything (~Everythin@37.115.210.35) (Quit: leaving)
[03:56:08] *** Joins: kerfluffy (~kerfluffy@user/kerfluffy)
[03:59:56] <tinwhiskers> emulsions are oils in water (like breast milk). The mixing of milk (already an emulsion) and jam isn't really creating an emulsion since both the jam and the milk are largely water, they are just mixing.
[04:00:29] <tinwhiskers> If they are not mixing well due to being different viscosity then the "home mom" term is lumpy :-)
[04:01:38] <Me-me> I don't know, I feel like an emulsion of an emulsion is still a valid use of the term. It's all to do with miscibility.
[04:02:04] <tinwhiskers> I don't think you'd call mixing milk and jam an emulsion.
[04:02:58] <Me-me> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion Nothing in this definition appears to exclude it.
[04:03:18] <Me-me> Although I guess it would only apply if the jam and milk did intermix.
[04:03:25] <tinwhiskers> "that are normally immiscible" - jam and milk are not immiscible 
[04:03:33] <Me-me> Semantics.
[04:03:38] <tinwhiskers> no, defintions
[04:04:03] <tinwhiskers> it means, for example, water and oil don't mix (immiscible) so they can form an emulsion.
[04:04:10] <Me-me> We are referring specifically to the evntuality of immiscibility of the jam and the milk. Their ordinary behaviour is not in question here.
[04:04:17] <tinwhiskers> Milk and jam do mix just fine, and do not form an emulsion.
[04:06:00] <Square> Home mom was just a bad translation from my native language. I guess I fishing for the common people term rather than the chemistry version.
[04:06:41] <tinwhiskers> yeah, so if you mix two water-based things of very different visconsity they'll go lumpy
[04:06:52] <tinwhiskers> (unless you do it right)
[04:07:07] <Square> im not specifically talking jam and milk. Just one example. This happens when you mix fat and non fat liquid liguids i guess? 
[04:07:35] <Me-me> There's also phase separation. That's another technical term, though.
[04:08:04] <Me-me> Colloid is another technical term.
[04:08:05] <tinwhiskers> ok, if you're talking about oils and water specifically then yes, an emulsion is the right term
[04:08:27] <Me-me> tinwhiskers: He is very expicitly not talking about anything specifically.
[04:09:01] <tinwhiskers> yeah, but he's hoping for a cover-all word and emulsion is specific immiscible materials only
[04:09:09] <Square> In my language (swedish) we say "the mixture *cuts* itself"
[04:09:18] <tinwhiskers> ok
[04:09:20] * darsie made a ternary mixture: oil, isopropanol and saturated calcium chloride in water solution.
[04:12:21] <darsie> heterogenous mixture
[04:12:59] <Me-me> I don't know of a colloquial term for the process. Wikipedia just brings me to all sorts of technical terms.

[21:16:29] <furrykef> So I looked it up and apparently the pronunciation of this word is variable all over the world
