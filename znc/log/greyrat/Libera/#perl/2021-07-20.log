[00:52:01] <xenu> brtastic: because perl parser is stupid and uses heuristics to differentiate between map EXPR and map BLOCK
[00:52:16] <Grinnz> put the list inside the block in () to unconfuse the parser
[00:52:54] <xenu> typically people put ; after { to force the BLOCK interpretation and + before { to force EXPR

[07:24:46] <genio> simcop2387: If the creator of the winlibs bundle is ok with that, I may use it as a starting point. because, why not? for now, I'm seeing how annoying it is to build mingw/gcc from msys2
[07:25:16] <simcop2387> i'm gonna have to do the mingw/clang bit for arm64 regardless.
[07:25:40] <genio> the clang build of winlibs is just plain huge
[07:26:12] <simcop2387> i think the bigger issue you might run into is that i believe a number of things inside strawberry depend on the posix emulation from msys2 (aka a fork of cygwin)
[07:26:33] <simcop2387> which is where i'm still mostly stuck while trying to figure out how to build that and then port it to arm64 for them
[07:26:38] <genio> LLVM/Clang/LLD/LLDB  in one of the bundles they ship is over 1GB

[19:16:15] <lopid> thanks, Paperbot, you added a lot 
[19:16:17] <simcop2387> omg but its dead, use rust and go
[19:16:21] <Altreus> Botje-: can't say I've noticed
[19:16:48] <Altreus> Establishing an ssh connection takes an unknown amount of time, so I don't notice the proportion of that which is actually loading the shell
[19:17:02] <Altreus> Plus, shared dev server = contention = slow as molasses anyway
[19:17:42] <simcop2387> Altreus: msster connection stuff, faster for multiple connections.  
[19:18:03] <LeoNerd> simcop2387: up until your network breaks
[19:18:29] <Altreus> what is this thing you say
[19:18:36] <simcop2387> thats usually not too bad to deal with still
[19:18:40] <LeoNerd> Ugh, it's terrible
[19:18:46] <simcop2387> https://www.anchor.com.au/blog/2010/02/ssh-controlmaster-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/
[19:18:49] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ SSH ControlMaster: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly - AWS Managed Services by Anchor ]
[19:18:57] <LeoNerd> it requires you to `rm` the socket off the disk when the network breaks
[19:19:13] <LeoNerd> and it takes _aaaages_ to recover after little packetloss or somesuch
[19:19:29] <LeoNerd> It looks a good idea on paper but I ended up turning it off again because it just gets more annoying
[19:19:39] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: what? not even close.  just close the ssh processes
[19:19:46] <LeoNerd> That doesn't help
[19:19:49] <LeoNerd> that leaves the socket on disk
[19:19:54] *** Joins: jplesnik (~jplesnik@nat-pool-brq-t.redhat.com)
[19:20:03] <LeoNerd> ssh tries first to close the TCP connection and _after_ it has done that it'll unlink the socket
[19:20:05] <simcop2387> i have never in 10 years needed ro rm the socket
[19:20:16] <tm604> likewise, killing the ssh process is always sufficient
[19:20:19] <LeoNerd> If the network is so broken you can't exchange FIN packets, that does'nt happen. control master socket remains on disk
[19:20:24] <LeoNerd> huh then maybe I am doing it wrong

[19:20:34] <tm604> and low timeouts for unreliable connections - using ssh without ControlMaster would be a nightmare I would not like to relive
[19:22:42] <tm604> just tried again to confirm - if there's a leftover socket file on disk and the original owning process has gone, ssh will automatically remove it and start from scratch
[19:22:54] <LeoNerd> Huh.. it's never done that for me
[19:23:06] <simcop2387> what version openssh?
[19:23:38] <mmlj4> ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm_socket/%[email protected]%h:%p
[19:23:49] <simcop2387> lol email
[19:23:51] <mmlj4> I had no idea it was that easy to use :-/
[19:25:34] <simcop2387> you do have to usually kill the ssh processes in the angry path but the speed up in the happy path is so hugely better it's worth it.  from 2-6 seconds over a slow vpn to 100ms or so for a new ssh connection to a machine you're already on
[19:25:54] <LeoNerd> I usually do kill mine, but the socket remains
[19:26:27] <simcop2387> yea even without it you still have to do that sometimes
[19:28:46] <tm604> mjgardner: I don't think that article is likely to change opinions by much - might be more effective by starting with an example of Perl that _doesn't_ look like line noise, rather than trying to persuade people that line noise is good for them!
[19:29:52] <mjgardner> I post that kind of code most weeks.
[19:29:52] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: do you add ControlPersist maybe? i've always avoided it
[19:30:13] <LeoNerd> ControlPersist 1s
