[02:21:39] <ButterNoodle> thats a 65*% w the arrows
[02:21:44] <ButterNoodle> so they call it
[02:21:48] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: i mean i googled 60% and none of those have the function row
[02:21:49] <theholyduck> :P
[02:21:56] <theholyduck> but 10-12 years ago 
[02:21:58] <ButterNoodle> so they are 60%
[02:22:14] <theholyduck> im pretty sure function keys was like the 60% size
[02:22:21] <theholyduck> i.e choc mini and similarly sized keyboards
[02:22:24] <ButterNoodle> when did the first vortex poker release
[02:22:36] <ButterNoodle> and then the kits before
[02:22:57] <theholyduck> poker was a few years later. 
[02:23:00] <theholyduck> like id say 2014?
[02:23:01] <theholyduck> or 15
[02:23:12] <ButterNoodle> pretty sure the purists would never have arrow keys on their 60%
[02:23:13] <theholyduck> and im almost entirely sure we used to call those 40% 
[02:23:30] <ButterNoodle> no a 40% would be a plank or a vortex core
[02:23:38] <ButterNoodle> a 4 row board

[02:25:33] <theholyduck> make a choc mini-alike with a decent keycap set

[03:04:57] <ButterNoodle> tru.. that would be a bit difficult to adapt to
[03:06:19] <theholyduck> most of my ergo dox thing was that at the time i didnt split the layout 50/50
[03:06:32] <theholyduck> like my right hand moved over 1 more row compared to my left back then
[03:07:20] <theholyduck> like my right pointer would index on H rather than j
[03:08:00] <theholyduck> which caused problems because i hit B with my right hand. where as on the ergo dox it was on the left

[03:12:31] <theholyduck> klaxa: :P well the reason ergo dox does it that way is thats the row it would end up in if you didnt stagger the keyboard
[03:12:32] <klaxa> i know it's easy to switch, but i don't want to :P
[03:13:11] <theholyduck> TGB is the same row on the keyboard once not staggered. and soo. b has to switch to the left side :P

[03:29:39] <Nanobot> So, I think the U.S. Congress might have just accidentally banned Bitcoin mining.
[03:30:34] <Nanobot> The amendment to fix it didn't pass, because it required unanimous consent, and someone objected over wanting some extra military spending.
[03:32:06] <Nanobot> Indications are that the administration doesn't intend to go after Bitcoin miners or the other parties that got mistakenly lumped into the definition of brokers, but... it's now legal gray area.
[03:32:33] <Nanobot> (assuming the infrastructure bill is passed, which looks to be a near certainty)
[03:33:34] <Nanobot> If I understand correctly, it won't go into effect until 2023 anyway, so there's time to fix it. But I don't know how difficult that is.
[03:35:59] <klaxa> so that means price will surge?
[03:36:43] <Nanobot> News tends to not affect the Bitcoin price much.
[03:37:08] <Nanobot> The Bitcoin price is heavily affected by block reward halving, and then technical trading stuff.
[03:37:12] * klaxa points at march 2020
[03:37:14] <klaxa> yeah it does
[03:37:44] * Nanobot points to all the people who, like me, were planning to sell around $60k regardless of any news.
[03:37:47] <klaxa> there is a lot of belief/trust in the trustless design in there
[03:38:40] <klaxa> it's not just math and tech, it's a lot of marketing as well
[03:39:02] <klaxa> not necessarily paid marketing, but marketing nonetheless
[03:39:17] <Nanobot> To be clear, when I say "technical trading stuff", I don't mean technical as in technology.
[03:39:38] <Nanobot> I mean technical as in professional trader stuff
[03:39:52] <klaxa> i see

[03:41:17] <Nanobot> The only surprise I've seen this year in terms of the Bitcoin price is that the drop never got as low as $27k. It's been more bullish than I expected.
[03:41:44] <klaxa> the thing i'm most anxious about in bitcoin is the whole tether situation
[03:42:15] <klaxa> because tether doesn't seem to be backed by actual dollars and they put tether on the chain in huge chunks
[03:43:28] <Nanobot> I don't really pay attention to altcoins. Most of them are scams. And the ones that are centralized (like Tether) miss the point of what makes Bitcoin valuable in the first place.

[04:25:18] <klaxa> dunno, neural net stuff could be used for all sorts of stuff, many expect it to expand for quite a bit before it becomes obsolete, given that expectation having hardware ready for fast inference on mobile devices doesn't seem too stupid
[04:25:33] <klaxa> but for the time being it's a gimmick

[08:24:34] <theholyduck> thats a crazy transformation
[08:24:52] <emmeka> well, it was a time when the Japanese anime industry thought selling DVDs was the end all be all of revenue
[08:25:16] <theholyduck> i mean it helps they were selling them at like 400 bucks a series
[08:25:27] <emmeka> they didn't really care about some stupid website in the US
[08:25:39] <theholyduck> wehn you are selling that anime fix for hundreds of bucks each hit to otaku 
[08:25:58] <theholyduck> thats why they were always so worried about reverse imports and shit
[08:26:06] <theholyduck> like you could buy a dvd of an anime series for 1/10th the price in the us

[08:30:54] <emmeka> yes, at the very tippy top of the pyramid, they're all owned by Sony conglomerate
[08:31:07] <emmeka> but they're completely different ends of the company reporting to different people
[08:31:13] <theholyduck> for now
[08:31:16] <emmeka> for years, the de facto situation was that Sony was competing with itself.
[08:31:26] <theholyduck> i mean if you are buying crunchy though
[08:31:30] <theholyduck> you are trying to make a anime conglomerate
[08:31:33] <emmeka> and since anime is so small of a blip though, they barely noticed.
[08:31:40] <theholyduck> soo. maybe makes sense putting the aniplex bit into it
[08:31:41] <emmeka> American anime licensing specifically, too
[08:32:16] <theholyduck> seeing as they own the stuff all the way up anyway. they are presunmably free to transfer the various parts over to 1 "sony anime liscencing and production"
[08:32:17] <theholyduck> or whatever
[08:32:47] <emmeka> theholyduck they already partially rectified the situation with Aniplex like... last year? In that they changed Funimation's ownership structure so that instead of just Sony Pictures Television owning it, Aniplex also got a share of the company
[08:33:14] <theholyduck> ok so you think its all going to fall sort of under aniplex
[08:33:16] <emmeka> which is a confusing and sort of stupid way to do it, but the result was Aniplex's shows appeared on Funimation
[08:33:17] <theholyduck> that actually produces anime in japan
[08:33:25] <emmeka> I think that's unlikely.
[08:33:26] <theholyduck> emmeka i mean theres a LOT of aniplex shows,
[08:33:43] <theholyduck> they are big  players in the like more grown up stuff
[08:33:51] <emmeka> Aniplex subcontracts all of its actual localization work out. It's a suboffice of the much larger Japanese producer.
[08:33:59] <emmeka> it does basically nothing.
[08:34:30] <emmeka> Funimation is a full fledged licensor though, it has its own voice acting studios for dubs and does tonnes of shit
[08:34:41] <theholyduck> emmeka: i mean providing funding and distribution for the production of anime isnt nothing though . 
[08:34:47] <rando25902> so millions pumping in that machine funimation
[08:35:09] <theholyduck> emmeka:  like so many of the shows i love were funded/produced with aniplex
[08:35:18] <emmeka> yes, Aniplex Japan.
[08:35:31] <emmeka> this may be confusing, but I'm talking about Aniplex USA.
[08:35:41] <rando25902> since they pay the illustators
[08:35:54] <theholyduck> well the aniplex japan is the ones who owns a bit of funi
[08:36:01] <emmeka> Aniplex USA is a subsidiary of Aniplex Japan whose sole purpose is basically to directly market Aniplex shows within the USA without having to go through other licensors.
[08:36:02] <theholyduck> if im reading this right they own 95% of funi?
[08:36:10] <emmeka> you're reading incorrect.

[08:37:54] <theholyduck> if they now own both funi and soon will own crunchy
[08:38:09] <theholyduck> they dont really need a seperate us distrebution arm
[08:38:11] <emmeka> that will depend what Aniplex Japan wants, because Aniplex USA is basically their puppet

[08:38:42] *** Joins: volki57 (~volki57@95.70.134.1)
[08:38:46] <emmeka> Aniplex USA's sole purpose is for Aniplex to directly bypass all other licensors and let Japan market anime the way they want to market anime (by selling expensive blurays and airing it on late night TV)
[08:39:09] <emmeka> Aniplex USA's business model is straight out of Tokyo circa 2005
[08:39:18] <theholyduck> ;D 
[08:39:45] <emmeka> they don't have a streaming platform. they don't have their own studios. they charge absurd prices for blurays, which are released in parts
[08:39:56] <theholyduck> emmeka: apparently they USED to have a streaming platform 
[08:40:04] <emmeka> basically all they do is take the Japanese release, and subcontract out the sub/dub work
[08:40:11] <emmeka> theholyduck very briefly, and it never really worked.
[08:40:11] <theholyduck> what is absurd? last i checked japanese prices is like 70 bucks for 2 or 3 episodes of anime
[08:40:44] <theholyduck> emmeka: but sure you are describing like trying to be the japanese market
[08:41:13] <theholyduck> i do thin kthey could have more vision to try and break out of the fucking niche they are in
[08:41:36] <theholyduck> anime in general that is
[08:41:52] <theholyduck> the japanese anime strategy is part of why so much of anime is so.. for lack of a better word
[08:41:54] <theholyduck> problematic

[08:43:17] <rando25902> its ok not here to argue 
[08:44:10] <emmeka> Crunchyroll also subcontracts out its dub work, and Funimation has taken to outsourcing some of its dubs (since they're currently stuck with a massive backlog) to the same studios that Crunchyroll uses. So my guess is that everything will roll under the umbrella of Funimation, either with the weird situation with Aniplex persisting, or a whole new frankencompany being created
[08:44:35] <MootPoot> I'll consider them when they let me download
[08:44:39] <theholyduck> i mean aniplex of america sort of exists to let traditional tv and stuff put shows on it

[08:44:47] <MootPoot> If they dont they can gtfo
[08:45:02] <emmeka> theholyduck no, not really, considering Funimation licenses out their shows to Adult Swim too

[08:47:14] <theholyduck> in theory atleast

[08:47:52] <mattmob> anyone watch doom patrol or stargirl?
[08:48:10] <theholyduck> emmeka:  sure. but the timeshifting argument doesnt make sense for a streaming service

[08:48:20] <theholyduck> emmeka: im not  saying you have NO legs to stand on 
[08:48:28] <emmeka> theholyduck sure it does. you know what isn't available 24/7? internet access.
[08:48:34] <amigojapan> Hey MootPoot
[08:48:44] <theholyduck> just saying you can find points of distinction
[08:48:46] <MootPoot> at least with mp3s here in canaderp I remember there being something about its okay to download but illegal to distribute?
[08:48:49] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  hai
[08:48:53] <theholyduck> between the betamax rulings and the rulings today 
[08:49:03] <emmeka> theholyduck anyway this is tested sufficiently to the point where fairly large companies exist built around providing ripping streaming sites as a service
[08:49:22] <theholyduck> really? i mean ive seen people do it with RTMP dumping stuff
[08:49:29] <theholyduck> but i never seen anyone offering a service to let you do dthis
[08:49:46] <emmeka> yeah. mathu's around, what was that one I pointed him to when he asked for it...
[08:49:50] <emmeka> I can't remember it now

[08:56:35] <theholyduck> soo you need to re-encode what you are getting
[08:56:43] <emmeka> MootPoot the courts disagreed, saying that Sony was not liable for any misuse of their devices for piracy, and also saying that recording TV programs for the purposes of timeshifting was fair use.
[08:56:48] <theholyduck> ofcourse that means you would then needd to watch the entire thing through 
[08:56:51] <theholyduck> to make a copy

[08:57:41] <theholyduck> as far as i can tell from the description it does not grab the video stream you are getting in
[08:57:50] <theholyduck> it captures the display area and saves that as a video file
[08:58:19] <emmeka> theholyduck the ripping of a stream by recording it. you don't have to "watch the whole thing" yourself. it does that for you, on the cloud, as some sort of bullshit cloud-based DVR

[09:00:31] <mattmob> why was his bkack magic soecial
[09:00:37] <emmeka> theholyduck easily, betamax case, same thing I've been saying the whole time. whether it's on a fileserver or on magnetic tape, it doesn't matter, so long as *you* are the one copying it for *your* personal use. This becomes illegal as soon as *you* share it with someone else.
[09:00:44] <mattmob> soery ik really high, whos tomako?
[09:00:48] <mattmob> oh waitt..
[09:00:49] <emmeka> and the service itself, is not liable for this.
[09:00:52] <theholyduck> emmeka:  but yo uarent copying it for your personal use 
[09:01:00] <theholyduck> you are telling this service to copy it on the internet
[09:01:02] <theholyduck> and then send yo ua copy
[09:01:14] <amigojapan> Mattmob tomako is my wife
[09:01:15] <theholyduck> i think the distinction on the cloud thing is way bigger
[09:01:26] <mattmob> oh hi hello ^^
[09:01:30] <emmeka> no, you're telling them to copy it and leave it in the place where they're supposed to put the copied material.
[09:01:35] <emmeka> ie, identical to a betamax player...
[09:01:36] <MootPoot> >The Court explains that a manufacturer of a product is not liable for contributory infringement as long as the product is "capable of substantial noninfringing uses"
[09:01:37] <emmeka> it's the same.
[09:01:40] <MootPoot> From the wiki
[09:01:44] <theholyduck> emmeka:  its not REALLY the same :P
[09:01:49] <emmeka> it really is though.
[09:01:50] <theholyduck> like if we go back to old school
[09:01:52] <mattmob> wow yoy guys write rwally fast
[09:01:55] <emmeka> this is why it is legal.
[09:01:58] <theholyduck> i dont think the betamax case would ahve covered
[09:02:04] <theholyduck> sending a mail to company y
[09:02:07] <MootPoot> So it can't be an accessory to piracy if you can't come up with legal uses for it?
[09:02:08] <theholyduck> to make a copy of show Z on tv
[09:02:13] <amigojapan> Mattmob tomako is sleeping now
[09:02:13] <theholyduck> and have them mail you the tape
[09:02:13] <emmeka> this is why the service I just linked you to has actually been around for years
[09:02:23] <mattmob> kk
[09:02:30] <theholyduck> emmeka: its also super tiny and i have never heard of it
[09:02:34] <theholyduck> maybe nobody has bothered yet
[09:02:49] <theholyduck> like i think once it leaves something you have direct control over
[09:02:53] <theholyduck> and start happening on somebodys server somewhere
[09:03:02] <theholyduck> we left the analogy of recording at home
[09:03:03] <emmeka> theholyduck it does copy: ripping a live feed from radiowaves, saving it to magnetic tape in a place it was never intended to be saved, using a third party device, and then keeping that copy stored indefinitely.
[09:03:05] <MootPoot> mattmob: ur Asking me to spoil like the first 3 seasons lol
[09:03:11] <mattmob> .. pm?
[09:03:14] <theholyduck> emmeka: yes. if you do that you are fine
[09:03:22] <theholyduck> but if you then SOLD that copy 
[09:03:23] <theholyduck> to somebody else
[09:03:25] <mattmob> i dont wave time to watch ahain
[09:03:27] <theholyduck> that would be illegal
[09:03:35] <emmeka> theholyduck yes. that is the betamax case. can we move on?
[09:03:39] <mattmob> if not is ok
[09:03:43] <MootPoot> Eh
[09:03:45] <theholyduck> emmeka: how is their cloud service selling you a copy
[09:03:54] <MootPoot> Black power= bad
[09:03:57] <theholyduck> NOT more analagous to me
[09:03:57] <mattmob> zetamax is best :D
[09:03:59] <theholyduck> than to you?
[09:04:08] <MootPoot> Good + bad power = extra strong
[09:04:09] <theholyduck> you arent making a copy they are
[09:04:12] <emmeka> it's not selling you a copy anymore than Sony selling you a betamax recorder is selling you a copy.
[09:04:18] <MootPoot> Mostly everyone else is only good or bad power
[09:04:21] <MootPoot> That's it
[09:04:23] <emmeka> or the store selling you a blank betamax is selling you a copy.
[09:04:25] <theholyduck> emmeka:  sure. because YOU operate the betamax
[09:04:29] <theholyduck> in your home
[09:04:31] <MootPoot> In the simplist way
[09:04:32] <theholyduck> and you dont sell the tape
[09:04:43] <emmeka> theholyduck they're not selling you the copy.
[09:04:47] <theholyduck> sure they are
[09:04:50] <theholyduck> they charge for the cloud service
[09:04:52] <theholyduck> in credits
[09:04:54] <emmeka> no, they're not.
[09:05:03] <emmeka> again: this is identical to selling magnetic tape.
[09:05:12] <MootPoot> Fight! Fight! Fight!
[09:05:16] <theholyduck> no. because they put the stuff on the tape allready
[09:05:21] <theholyduck> they arent selling you blank tapes
[09:05:28] <mattmob> may i ask what tge oeoginal discussion was on.. in kinda curipus
[09:05:28] <theholyduck> they are selling you tapes with your shows on it
[09:05:29] <emmeka> why are we even fighting about this? my point is proven by the fact that this exists and has for years.
[09:05:29] * MootPoot starts taking bets on beaver vs duck fight
[09:05:44] <theholyduck> emmeka: just because nobody has sued them out of existance yet
[09:05:46] <theholyduck> doesnt mean they wont
[09:06:14] <MootPoot> True on a technical sense but they haven't yet for a reason
[09:06:19] <emmeka> yeah I'm sure the 5000 lawyers Hollywood has on payroll literally combing everything to throw cease and desist orders at, just missed this
[09:06:29] <emmeka> for years.
[09:06:37] <emmeka> and the other services like it
[09:06:59] <emmeka> and the people who do this themselves or make free services to do it
[09:07:01] <theholyduck> again i have never heard of this company before and the computer thing they offer i think fits the analogy of tape recorder
[09:07:15] <theholyduck> its their more recent cloud service
[09:07:18] <theholyduck> im like.. wat..
[09:07:40] <emmeka> it's literally identical.
[09:07:48] <emmeka> I'm sure their lawyers advised them of the same.
[09:07:48] <theholyduck> the cloud part changes erverything though
[09:07:53] <MootPoot> Btw say the betamax case went the other way and Sony left the USA. If people imported those devices 3rd party and used them would they be illegal then? 
[09:07:53] <emmeka> no, it changes nothing.
[09:08:05] <emmeka> whether it's on a cloud or on a tape is irrelevant, what matters is whether you share it.
[09:08:11] <theholyduck> yes exactly
[09:08:19] <theholyduck> what they are running is essentially a warehouse full of betamax machines
[09:08:28] <theholyduck> where you send in a buck and tell them what shows to record
[09:08:33] <theholyduck> and they send you back a tape with those shows on it
[09:08:36] <theholyduck> thats VERY DIFFERENT
[09:08:41] <theholyduck> from using the betamax machine in your own home
[09:08:42] <emmeka> no, that's hardly accurate.

[09:08:52] <theholyduck> emmeka:  thats what putting the thing in the cloud is..
[09:09:16] <mattmob> werk
[09:09:17] <theholyduck> once it leaves the sanctity of your house and a device you operate 
[09:09:24] <theholyduck> onto a cloud service. 
[09:09:24] <MootPoot> They don't record it in the same real time way though as recording from a tv signal
[09:09:32] <MootPoot> There is a difference there
[09:09:36] <theholyduck> MootPoot: also note how their cloud service works on fewer services than their desktop one
[09:09:44] <theholyduck> itake it they have infact been sued and forced to stop supporting
[09:09:48] <theholyduck> some services
[09:09:48] <MootPoot> They get given the master for with the express permission to share it

[09:10:04] <kingme2> test.
[09:10:11] <theholyduck> MootPoot: they dont though
[09:10:12] <emmeka> a more accurate analogy would be a warehouse full of spaces to put betamax machines, where you rent a place to put your betamax machine, and then buy a number of blank tapes from them. you have the cable company hook up your services to that warehouse, and then there's a guy at the warehouse who sits there and presses record when you tell him to.
[09:10:14] <theholyduck> netflix does that
[09:10:40] <theholyduck> emmeka:  except they are providing the betamax machines . and the tapes and the dude
[09:10:51] <emmeka> the distinctions here are important: 1) they're not selling you copies, they're selling you storage space and the means to MAKE copies.
[09:11:16] <emmeka> 2) the services they're recording from are ones you legitimately have the right to make copies of, personally.
[09:11:41] <theholyduck> i dont dispute 2. but by not only being the provider of the means to do this
[09:11:44] <theholyduck> but actually being the ones doing this
[09:11:48] <theholyduck> it changes things
[09:11:49] <emmeka> anyway, this is pointless, because my point is proven by the fact that this exists already and has for many years.
[09:11:59] <theholyduck> emmeka: except their cloud thing clearly has faced SOME issues
[09:12:04] <theholyduck> as it works on fewer services
[09:12:21] <theholyduck> i asume those companies either sued or threatened to sue
[09:12:23] <amigojapan> MootPoot it will be 37c here today
[09:12:27] <MootPoot> 2021 is crazy, I'm watching a farmer and his duck argue copyright law
[09:12:31] <emmeka> and your counterargument is just that somehow the legion of corporate lawyers out to DMCA everyone just missed it somehow
[09:12:32] <MootPoot> amigojapan: oof
[09:12:41] <MootPoot> Its going to be 35 on the weekend here
[09:12:46] <MootPoot> I was thinking about going camping
[09:12:48] <theholyduck> emmeka: its a thing a) basicly nobody uses and B) would cause a ton of bad press
[09:13:15] <theholyduck> theres a lot of stuff going on on the internet thats just blatant copyright violation
[09:13:29] <theholyduck> and companies chose not to go after because of all the bad press they got due to the RIAA and mpaa suing kids
[09:13:29] <theholyduck> and shit
[09:13:35] <MootPoot> This is how to take care of an angry duck https://youtu.be/Kx76F4yR134

[09:14:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot I would not go camping in mid summer
[09:14:07] <emmeka> theholyduck the desktop one is only unlimited in what platforms it supports because it is literally nothing but screen capture software that runs in the background
[09:14:19] <emmeka> the cloud one has to directly interface with specific platforms
[09:14:27] <theholyduck> emmeka:   like most of the big companies are pretty chill about anyone small time doing anything . its why they allow people to make memes with star wars or whatever 
[09:14:30] <emmeka> and it supports all the major ones, looking at it.
[09:14:36] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: hi
[09:14:48] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: hi
[09:14:50] <amigojapan> Hi butternoodle
[09:15:59] <theholyduck> emmeka:  im not saying it isnt a useful tool. and im not saying its not atleast plausible legal
[09:16:14] <theholyduck> im just saying. if you were a lawyet arguing this in court you could atleast make a distinction
[09:16:21] <rando25902> yea vhs quality is shoddy
[09:16:24] <emmeka> it is legal beyond any shadow of a doubt and there's well established case law about it
[09:16:27] <emmeka> is my point.
[09:16:41] <theholyduck> emmeka:  eh as i said. i think theres a distinction to be made
[09:16:49] <rando25902> industry shoots the consumer once again
[09:16:51] <emmeka> and, so, if you want to watch content on streaming services you subscribe to yourself offline, download it.
[09:16:52] <theholyduck> it might be a distinction without a difference depending on the judge you get
[09:17:19] <theholyduck> and it might not be worth spending the money on an expensive ass lawsuit like this from such a small time player
[09:17:33] <theholyduck> like they hafve 1500 ratings on the google app store
[09:17:48] <theholyduck> 1400 on the ios one
[09:18:40] <theholyduck> emmeka: basicly i think my argument would be. if a big enough player tried running this scheme. some lawyers would atleast try to make that distinction. but this thing is so tiny its not costing anyone any money. and the rips they make are going to be too shit to be worth redistributing anyway

[09:18:45] <emmeka> and have been around for like 15 years, by the looks of it
[09:18:50] <theholyduck> the desktop one yes
[09:18:53] <theholyduck> the cloud thing is newer
[09:19:36] <emmeka> yes and I'm sure a company that's been that long in the industry of something as legal-battleground-y as home video recording would have had lawyers sit and think on this one before doing it.
[09:19:36] <theholyduck> the loud thing is 5 years old. 
[09:19:53] <theholyduck> emmeka: again. they have like maybe a few thousand users?
[09:20:03] <theholyduck> is it really worth it to cause a stink over something like that?
[09:20:13] <emmeka> you think 3000 ratings = a few thousand users?
[09:20:54] <theholyduck> like less than half a million id say yes
[09:21:05] <theholyduck> probably a lot less
[09:22:44] <theholyduck> playstore says its been downloaded more than 100k
[09:22:46] <theholyduck> but less than 500k
[09:23:57] <emmeka> sounds substantial, considering that excludes iOS and PC users. But, really, why am I still arguing about this, I was just trying to point out to MootPoot that "I can't download copies of streaming services" is factually untrue, because it is.
[09:24:12] <theholyduck> indeed you absolutely can
[09:24:50] <theholyduck> thats 100k total downloads mind you over 5 years
[09:25:00] <emmeka> it's sufficiently true that this exists aboveboard, and is sufficiently legal that nothing has destroyed it for years, and that there is strong caselaw to support its existence, to the point where any consumer could expect to do this without legal trouble.
[09:25:05] <theholyduck> anyone who gets a new phone and installs the app again would b e counted twice :P

[13:10:17] <emmeka> Abrax also, it's kind of rude to just randomly spam everyone in a channel with invites to your own channel, please do not do this.
[13:10:25] <emmeka> Publios yes
[13:10:53] <Publios> legit
[13:11:47] <emmeka> Publios the maple trees are the females of the Canadian species, and Canadians are a parasitic lifeform. We reproduce by connecting hosts to our maples and infecting them.
[13:12:18] <Abrax> all canadians or just the natural born ones?
[13:12:20] <emmeka> Publios look at the bright side, now you get to drink better beer and have healthcare
[13:12:48] <Publios> drink better beer, like what, molson?
[13:12:49] <Publios> :p
[13:12:50] <emmeka> Abrax all, those who apply for citizenship get walked out to the maple trees for conversion after they take their oaths
[13:12:58] <Publios> we have great microbreweries here in the USA now
[13:13:02] <Publios> tho no healthcare
[13:13:03] <Publios> :p
[13:13:08] <Abrax> hah
[13:13:37] <emmeka> Publios I mean, Molson is basically our shit tier beer, and if I was to set one in front of you beside a Bud or a Coors, which would you choose :P
[13:13:52] <Publios> I'd probably flip a coin
[13:14:15] <Publios> coors is more likely if I had to choose
[13:14:16] <Publios> :p
[13:14:26] <emmeka> back to the maple tree with you
[13:14:46] <Abrax> eh could be worse
[13:14:50] <Abrax> you could be american

[15:30:26] <DunceCotus> though sure they are likely lamps
[15:32:14] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: did you know that the red pill in the matrix movie is an allegory for hormone replacement therapy?
[15:32:50] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: yeah
[15:33:35] <death916> theres nothing in the movie that implies that
[15:33:36] <KatrinValerie> kinda makes it really ironic that the alt-right coopted the term
[15:33:49] <KatrinValerie> death916: The author herself confirmed it though
[15:34:04] <death916> they added that explantion after they transition which is fine and all but its revisionist
[15:34:11] <death916> the switch character i can understand
[15:34:25] * KatrinValerie shrugs
[15:34:28] <death916> but the red pill had no subtext or any underlying tones implying anythign related to someone trans
[15:34:32] <KatrinValerie> It is a cool movie no matter how you read it
[15:34:50] <death916> ya im not against it i jus hate when meaning gets added that wasnt there and makes no sense in contect
[15:34:52] <KatrinValerie> death916: it has the subtext for those that are trans
[15:34:56] <death916> how tho
[15:35:00] <death916> theres nothing there
[15:35:05] <death916> u cant just say it is
[15:35:09] <KatrinValerie> You just cannot recognise it when you are not trans
[15:35:14] <death916> my brother is
[15:35:14] <berlin36> I didn't watch the matrix
[15:35:16] <berlin36> Lul
[15:35:22] <death916> thaexplin it then
[15:35:29] <KatrinValerie> It is certainly not explicit at all
[15:35:33] <death916> therws no explanation except wachowski said
[15:35:35] <KatrinValerie> And you need meta knowledge
[15:35:39] <death916> i have meta knowledge

[15:35:47] <death916> its mad eup liek jjkrowling makin characters gay
[15:35:57] <berlin36> I didn't watch a looooot of popular movies :|
[15:36:01] <death916> i can belive the switch character was supposed to be and removed tho
[15:36:02] <KatrinValerie> The colour of the pill is a reference to the HRT pills they were taking
[15:36:10] <death916> hmm ok mayb idk what color they are
[15:36:13] <death916> id have to ask my bro
[15:36:23] <berlin36> They are so popular and i heard about them a lot of times that now i don't even have the interest to watch them
[15:36:57] <death916> like i said im not against the subtext or w.e being there i jus hate when its added post fact soley by "author said so"
[15:37:07] <death916> and not some film making skill
[15:37:08] <KatrinValerie> death916: they prescribe different colours now, most Estradiol Hemihydrate pills come as blue pills and the pills back then were premarin not estradiol.
[15:37:13] <DunceCotus> Dumbledore as gay kinda makes sense though
[15:37:16] <DunceCotus> his name is Dumbledore

[19:21:10] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, onee-chan, if you start a fired chicken restaurant you could name it Katrin's Fired Chicken! :D
[19:21:12] <amigojapan> Sadale: but it needs to have trans chikens
[19:21:28] <Sadale> amigojapan, lol nah that's too costly.
[19:21:37] <Sadale> Too costly to do transgender operation to the chicken
[19:22:09] <amigojapan> Sadale: just inject it with female hormones
[19:23:14] <amigojapan> Sadale: it could be a very expensive restaurant
[19:25:21] <Sadale> I don't think trans chicken would be any tastier than non-trans chicken tho
[19:25:33] <Sadale> and it'd be costy af to make trans chicken
[19:25:46] <amigojapan> Sadale: but trans people would like it
[19:25:51] <Sadale> LOL
[19:25:53] <Sadale> maybe
[19:26:16] <Sadale> Not sure if it'd be marketable in real life for a restaurant located in a physical place tho.
[19:26:33] <Sadale> If it's internet yes you could market someone and sell them to all those trans people on the internet

[19:30:51] <amigojapan> Trans chikens
[19:31:26] <Sadale> Llamamoe, and amigojapan suggested that Katrin's Fired Chick would sell fired transgender chicken.
[19:31:39] <Llamamoe> That sounds somehow scary 
[19:31:56] <Llamamoe> How would you even make a chicken transgender? Can chickens even develop that kind of abnormality? 
[19:32:03] <Llamamoe> Or do you mean raising male chickens on female hormones? 
[19:32:08] <Llamamoe> That's also kinda weird?
[19:32:29] <Llamamoe> I mean raising animals for meat is already fucked up abuse, so this isn't much worse, but why

[20:25:53] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you are in danger of getting eaten by us
[20:25:59] <Sadale> Bco1981, like color for individual keys
[20:26:01] <Bco1981> and light isn't passing through very well
[20:26:37] <Bco1981> Sadale: you can put a gif on each key if you want. but it will cost you.
[20:26:48] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I think that makes you more attractive for Chinese traditional medicine
[20:27:30] <Sadale> Bco1981, oh that's not that I mean. I mean each key would have a programmable RGB color that you can set using a program. And perhaps you could animate that.
[20:27:46] * MootPoot runs away into a protected crab sanctuary at some university
[20:28:15] <Sadale> Bco1981, technically it should be possible to do that. But I think it may not be commercial viable to do that tho because most users wouldn't have the time to program the animations.
[20:28:29] <Sadale> In fact, technically speaking, it should be rather easy to make such a keyboard.
[20:28:38] <Bco1981> yeah.
[20:28:44] <Sadale> Just not commercially viable.
[20:28:58] * amigojapan nukes MootPoot's lab
[20:29:00] <Sadale> Bco1981, So now, my question is, does this kind of keyboard actually exist?
[20:29:07] <Sadale> as far as you know.
[20:30:28] <Bco1981> not one i know of, maybe ButterNoodle does
[20:30:57] <amigojapan> Bco1981: Sadale it does exist. It's expensive
[20:31:07] <Sadale> amigojapan, any particular examples?
[20:31:18] <Sadale> If so I'd like to know the name of this kind of keyboard.
[20:31:55] <Bco1981> this one says "ANY COLOR. ANY COMBINATION. MULTIPLE EFFECTS. NO SOFTWARE NEEDED."  ... that sounds hard to do each individual key color
[20:31:58] <amigojapan> Sadale: I will need to search for it. But I know they exist. one minutes
[20:31:59] <Sadale> BTW, I do have one of these small size RGB keyboard that you could program the color of individual keys. But it doesn't support animation if you're in the individual-key-programmed mode.
[20:32:10] <Sadale> Bco1981, oh. Software's needed.
[20:33:19] <Bco1981> well, this is what i get for $30
[20:33:21] <Bco1981> 40*
[20:33:54] <Bco1981> atleast it's fairly silent.
[20:35:40] <Sadale> oh. It took me a while to figure out what you mean by silent.
[20:35:55] <Sadale> I was thinking if your keyboard had a fan or something for cooling. You're talking about the keypress.

[20:45:06] <Sadale> totally irrelevant. I think I should find a time to publish my alien writing system to somewhere. :p
[20:47:01] <amigojapan> Sadale: I thought you already did that
[20:47:27] <Sadale> amigojapan, yes. But I haven't publicly announced that.
[20:47:38] <amigojapan> I see
[20:47:42] <Sadale> Actually I'm thinking if I should publish that to omniglot
[20:48:05] <Sadale> I've seen someone who invented an alternative Chinese writing system. It seems that it's rather easy to publish one there
[20:48:38] <amigojapan> Sadale: good luck with that

[21:18:30] <MootPoot> ye
[21:18:31] <Sadale> There're a few kind of RFID tags tho. Make sure that the one installed into your hand would be compatible with all common RFID standards
[21:18:45] <MootPoot> or a phone when you pick it up it unlocks
[21:19:11] <Sadale> Newer phone has fingerprint unlocking
[21:19:32] <MootPoot> yes, but there are 2 problems with that
[21:19:35] <MootPoot> 1.) gloves
[21:19:58] <MootPoot> 2.) goverments know about fingerprints on phones and they can legally make you give it up
