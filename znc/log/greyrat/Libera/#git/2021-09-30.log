[11:09:18] <A_Dragon> using maintenance, I dont particularly want emails from cron unless something breaks (appears I get a commit hash?) currently I modified the cronjob to dump output to devnull (--quiet did not do as expected). Is this about expected or have I made some oversight?
[11:11:07] <Marquel> A_Dragon: cron mails all job output. always.
[11:11:35] <Marquel> so your jobs need to take care not to produce any output (and exit with error code 0) if nothing noteworthy happened.
[11:11:39] <A_Dragon> Marquel: this I know, my question is more if quiet is supposed to drop output (man says errors, but nothing about other output)
[11:12:16] <Marquel> i've yet to see a single git command not producing any output.
[11:12:27] <A_Dragon> Im hesitant to just modify the edits `git maintenance start` makes to my crontab as they will be overwritten

[11:20:07] <A_Dragon> oh you mean modifying your local crontab, yeah it can be annoying
[11:20:10] <Marquel> even if changes are reverted with maintenance stop. it's a no-go. a tool with a cron-job should(!) be able to leave all configs, that includes crontabs, fully untouched and work around any requirements (like, f.ex. not actually running cron jobs while in maintenance mode) by itself.

[11:21:39] <A_Dragon> I don't get your meaning. `start` simply adds `0 1-23 * * * "/usr/libexec/git/git" --exec-path="/usr/libexec/git" for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=hourly` and two others to crontab, you can happily run `run` if you don't want it to be automatic
[11:22:12] <A_Dragon> https://git-scm.com/docs/git-maintenance#_background_maintenance_on_posix_systems that would be the entire point of the `start` subcommand

[17:04:29] <very_sneaky> ahh. okay. There's actually a bit of indirection between my patch and git - this is part of patching existing source files for a conan recipe, but I can see their provided `tools.patch()` function has a `fuzz=True` parameter that I can pass :)

[17:43:37] <fuzzybear3965> Aghh, I tried to trim out the timestamps. Sorry gang.
[17:43:47] <fuzzybear3965> But, I still have that question.
[17:44:01] <fuzzybear3965> In case it matters, it looks like the branch that I'm rebasing may have some `git merge master` commits threaded into its history (the person with this PR branch is a sloppy git user).
[17:44:06] <very_sneaky> for interest, the problem was that the underlying patch library, `patch_ng.py` has some bugs
[17:44:35] <fuzzybear3965> `_ng` as in "next generation"?

So I add/commit a version on stream, checkout to my branch and start working, my plan is, then when a new upstream is
[23:25:53] <SpeakerToMeat__> released, I commit/stash my work, checkout upstream, unzip the new one add and commit all change (with a version tag probably), then checkout my branch, and merge from the upstream branch into mine... should that work? it's a sane solution?

[23:47:01] <nightstrike> I can use git commit --amend with local changes, unlike a rebase, where I have to stash everything first.  Is there a way to commit something, inserting it one before the current HEAD, without also having to rebase and thus stash all changes?

[23:55:57] <Guest7858> rebase is similar to git push
[23:56:04] <rewt> no it isn't
[23:56:06] <nightstrike> I wanted the functionality of amend, where stashing isn't required
[23:56:18] <rewt> what's wrong with stashing?
[23:56:32] <rewt> you can stash, do the rebase to reorder the commits, then stash pop to get back to where you were
[23:56:35] <Guest7858> can anyone explain 3 way merge
[23:57:13] <nightstrike> stash is a pain when you have a lot of changes
[23:57:21] <rewt> why?
