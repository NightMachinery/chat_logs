[19:10:39] <brownorange> A short summary of the situation is this. In math there exists sentences like "2+2=4", but also we can reference any math sentence by giving it a number. then you imagine a predicate A(x) meaning sentence with number x is true. blah blah blah. You get to a point where a sentence can reference it's own provability. Specifically to even deny its own provability.
[19:10:54] <assan> you look gentle Lumine are you?
[19:12:09] <Lumine> I'm not sure what that means
[19:12:51] <brownorange> My concern is that the ability to self-reference is more illusory than people think. Because the encoding portion can apply to everything.
[19:12:59] <pussipupu> we have Fierro and tonic with a hint of pomegranate
[19:13:12] <Lumine> pussipupu: sounds tasty

[19:13:34] <Lumine> A. Le Coqs
[19:13:46] <Lumine> Lithuanian beer
[19:14:30] <assan> i would take that as a no Lumine
[19:14:42] <brownorange> if I said imagine a predicate A(x) where x is a number for a plastic fork in a box of forks. There is some sense in which x is now referring to a particular plastic fork. But should we care?
[19:16:25] <brownorange> A(872) is a bent fork.
[19:17:39] <brownorange> the sentence "A(872) is a bent fork.  "  is not a bent fork. it's also kind of nonsensicle to ask if the sentence is a bent fork or not.

[20:58:42] <absentia> brownorange: is this not addressed by the diagnolization lemma
[20:58:44] <absentia> 2.4
[20:59:23] <absentia> it's claiming that from the formal system F, if we can deduce a sentence D, then a formula A in the system F at the godel number for the sentence D is also true
[20:59:28] <absentia> and the converse holds as well
[21:00:20] <absentia> i mean this section is even titled "self-reference" so it seems to address exactly your point
[21:00:24] <absentia> about the encoding not being the thing itself
[21:00:32] <absentia> this is asserting a direct biconditional relationship
[21:00:39] <brownorange> I doubt the biconditional on the basis that the A predicate doesn't do what it appears

[21:01:46] <absentia> great now i have to read the proof
[21:01:48] <brownorange> how do we know such predicate can exist meaningfully? the input godel number is just a number, albeit unique to a formula, but beyond that i see no reason to believe it does anything
[21:01:50] <absentia> gods spare me
[21:02:49] <brownorange> if the predicate is faulty than you don't know what's returned by it is the truth value for the sentence D, so biconditional may be wrong
[21:03:03] <absentia> brownorange: are you making a constructivist argument
[21:03:23] <brownorange> possibly?
[21:03:33] <absentia> i agree i've never actually seen an actual A predicate
[21:04:29] <brownorange> does the godel number reference the formula or does it really MEAN it . we could use any encoding we wanted. the operation appears to take place in our intent or mind
[21:04:47] <brownorange> it appears to me it just references.

[21:13:18] <absentia> so sure - consensus appears to be that godel's completeness theorem relies on a non-constructivist proof
[21:13:20] <brownorange> excluded middle is about truth not provability. even many who accepts excluded middle, know this
[21:14:04] <brownorange> but maybe we are getting confused because bivalent propositional (a or not a) is different than the other l.e.m
[21:16:12] <absentia> `(A <-> (A /\ |/- A))` this appears to be conflating the mathematics with the metamathematics
[21:16:19] <absentia> |/- is not a boolean logic operator
[21:16:28] <absentia> it's a metamathematical statement about the provability of mathematical statements
[21:16:53] <absentia> it's not clear to me how one even evaluates `A /\ |/- A` in propositional logic
[21:16:57] <absentia> I'm claiming it's not a well-formed formula
[21:17:09] <brownorange> math and logic have been used in metamathematical results. but to be fair there's a literal provability predicate you must accept for Godel's own proofs
