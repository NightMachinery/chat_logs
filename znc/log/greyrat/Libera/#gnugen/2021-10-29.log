[12:59:30] <afontain[m]> the GNOME calculator is actually pretty good
[13:07:41] <typedef[m]> Pretty good indeed
[13:07:46] <typedef[m]> I usually use python, though
[13:07:53] <afontain[m]> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[13:08:07] <afontain[m]> I do that from time to time
[13:08:29] <afontain[m]> the "_" shortcut is a nice trick
[14:00:31] <Orbstheorem> Y use I python or ghci
[14:08:04] <Notkea> what do you use to take notes? A friend sent me https://obsidian.md/ but it's not open source and it's yet another Electron app, but it has a nice feature to generate a graph from the links between documents and can show cross-references inline. Do you know a similar solution which is open source and integrates with usual text editors? There is org-mode but I can't really use that with vim :/
[14:10:27] <Notkea> just found https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg which looks promising, but it's using yet another markup… Hmm…
[14:12:35] <afontain[m]> poor's man hyperlink: gf (go file) will open the file under your cursor
[14:12:56] <Orbstheorem> A markdown file
[14:13:16] <Notkea> how do you show the cross-references?
[14:13:26] <Notkea> or generate a graph?
[14:13:39] <afontain[m]> I don't
[14:15:21] <Orbstheorem> Or vimwiki, if I need task support, which isn't great but gets the job done.
[14:17:27] <Notkea> hmm
[14:18:02] <Orbstheorem> Notkea: I don't
[14:20:15] <Notkea> I think I'm falling down a rabbithole: either writing a pandoc importer for vimwiki and neorg, or writing a vim plugin that just uses ripgrep to find cross references in the same directory…
[14:37:19] <afontain[m]> what do you use a graph for actually?
[14:52:25] <Orbstheorem> <afontain[m]> "what do you use a graph for..." <- This is a good question.
[14:57:21] <Orbstheorem> <Notkea> "I think I'm falling down a..." <- My experience with vimwiki has been average at best, navigating in and out of documents is slow (though, that may be taskwiki's fault) and the keybindings usually get in my way too often (so much, I literally only load vimwiki when I enter the index and am afraid of opening vimwiki in a vim session that I intend to keep (e.g. code)).
[15:00:11] <Orbstheorem> I like the idea of vimwiki though, I think it's in the right direction.
[15:31:34] <Notkea> so, for my personal notes, I just use markdown and ripgrep and it's good enough. But this is no longer workable for academic research, which is in great part about references between articles. I need a quick way to link those and visualise what links back to some article. This should facilitate exploring a topic and gathering the references back for the bibliography of the final article
[16:21:44] <Orbstheorem> Quelqu'un serait motivé à faire un petit hackaton gtk4[/rust]demain matin/après-midi ?
[18:08:12] <LaurentRoro[t][m> ça pourrait être marrant, mais je suis déjà pris
[18:24:59] <Orbstheorem> :(
[18:25:27] <Orbstheorem> artectrex ? ^^
[18:34:20] <typedef[m]> Je vais déjà avoir pas mal de trucs à faire ce week-end :(
[18:35:03] <artectrex[m]> Je suis à Zurich..
[18:35:24] <artectrex[m]> même si le sujet me parle
[18:39:22] <Orbstheorem> On peut se retrouver dans un café à Berne ? ^^
[18:39:34] <Orbstheorem> Autrement, on peut l'organiser pour la semaine prochaine ^^
[18:40:35] <artectrex[m]> heu
[18:40:40] <artectrex[m]> la semaine prochaine je suis à Dublin
[18:42:03] <Orbstheorem> Trop bien x)
[18:45:12] <Orbstheorem> Next tuesday afternoon?
[18:45:29] <Orbstheorem> (I don't want to run a framadate, cause it makes it a 'complicated' event.)
[18:46:14] <Orbstheorem> Simply a warm get toguether, hacking and jokes, just like once upon a time at the clubroom.
[19:15:45] <artectrex[m]> What about the week after that? When I'm not in the middle of midterms anymore lol
[19:16:10] <artectrex[m]> For example the week-end of the 13th
[19:17:09] <artectrex[m]> Sorry to keep saying I can't but I'm really behind on everything and have to move around all the time :/
[19:25:53] <Orbstheorem> The 13th is my bday x)
[19:26:00] <Orbstheorem> I was planning to go to locarno x)
[19:26:09] <Orbstheorem> But a hackaton sounds fun too :D
[19:26:20] <Orbstheorem> Weekend of the 13th then? :D
[19:26:36] <Orbstheorem> Cc afontain ^^

[19:44:22] <afontain[m]> On a pas la geekerie le 14?
[19:44:32] <artectrex[m]> le 21
[20:29:09] <afontain[m]> Du coup c'était https://unil.esn.ch/swiss_train_rallye
[20:45:07] <afontain[m]> Du coup ça dépend un peu de si les gens d'ESN veulent un peu de staff :P
[21:20:43] <afontain[m]> d'ailleurs, qqn qui connait OSM veut bien donner un peu de temps d'ici là ?
[21:21:17] <afontain[m]> parce que fun fact: j'ai jamais touché à Street Complete
[21:55:46] <artectrex[m]> <afontain[m]> "parce que fun fact: j'ai..." <- Ça s'explique tout seul si jamais
[21:55:57] <artectrex[m]> Faut un compte OSM par contre
