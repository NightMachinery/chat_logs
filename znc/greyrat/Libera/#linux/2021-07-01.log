[00:19:58] <curdlesnoot> dag: to elaborate, the behaviour of secure erase is generally well defined for ssds. they have an internal key by which data is decoded, and a secure erase is simply a case of writing a new key, invaliding the old data after which it appears to have been determinstically zeroed. for hdds, the behaviour of ata secure erase can vary but I would consider dd to be ok, short of physical destruction.

[05:39:46] <Kyv> how should I put it?
[05:39:51] <rascul> problem is that there's nothing about an ip in the spec that correlates it to any location so to get that information you have third parties trying to discover on their own or by voluntary submission where an ip address might be located
[05:40:18] <rascul> then you get a list from one of those third parties and have no way to verify the accuracy
[05:40:18] <sickdyd> what if I use a page like this https://ghostpath.com/servers/country/United%20States and run a whois on each address get the IP
[05:40:35] <sickdyd> and get the IP *
[05:40:40] <rascul> the whois isn't telling you anything about the physical location the ip is being used
[05:41:04] <sickdyd> yeah, but the website tells me those servers are located in the US (I guess I can trust this)

[07:59:21] <quartz> Kyv: Just out of pure curiosity, why do you use Artix?
[07:59:27] <jim> sem, for a wireless, it's often a good choice to go with network-manager
[07:59:30] <Dagmar> sem: You ever used a Nintendo 3DS?
[07:59:52] <vwork> Kyv: I have. So Artix is on traditional init then?
[08:00:02] <sem> iirc network-manager has a cli version
[08:00:15] <Kyv> vwork: well, OpenRC is available, and a few others
[08:00:17] <jim> sem, network-manager would show you the networks near you in a list you can choose
[08:00:30] <Dagmar> sem: It had a weird thing in it called "Streetpass" which was to sort of trade virtual stickers if you ever got your 3DS handhold _near_ another person's 3DS handheld... but that doesn't really work in the US.
[08:00:35] <Bashing-om> Guest87: 'sudo df -ih/ ' <- To list statistics about inode usage.
[08:00:41] <vwork> Kyv: But deliberate avoidance of systemd, I mean.
[08:00:52] <Kyv> quartz: it is like the minimalism and full control of Arch but moreso, given it doesnt use systemd.
[08:01:06] <quartz> Kyv: What is wrong with systemd?
[08:01:14] <Guest87> hmmm so it seems i have 1.9m free
[08:01:17] <Dagmar> sem: So tehy made "Streetpass Relays" which were where the 3DS would basically chat up open access points with certain names (like 'attwifi') and contact a central server to store some virtual whatnots for the next people that passed that same AP to pick up
[08:01:26] <Dagmar> sem: The entire thing was driven by the MAC address of the AP.
[08:01:37] <Guest87> so i guess that may not be the problem and it is a disk storage problem? I only have 2Gb left on my live usb
[08:01:51] <Dagmar> sem: So, appearing to be at a Starbucks in San Bernadino just required you know the mac address of the AP there and _spoof it_

[08:05:37] <Dagmar> You set the mac address _before_ you associate because the association with the AP is *bound* to the MAC address

[14:16:48] <geirha> blofish: when your program prints something with e.g. printf(), it doesn't actually get sent to stdout immediately. It gets sent to a buffer. If stdout is a tty, it typically gets flushed to stdout immediately. If stdout is not a tty, it will store it in that buffer until the buffer is full, then flush it.

[14:17:22] <DPA> Many programing languages such as python, but also c standard libraries such as libc, implement buffering for files. In C, that is the stdbuf stuff for FILE* objects: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setbuf.3.html
[14:17:22] <DPA> The destination file type affects the kind of buffering. Things like terminal device files are line buffered by default, but files are fully buffered. So unless the buffer fills up or the program calls fflush, nothing is written.

[14:35:35] <DPA> I think the best course of action at this point is to "strace -f" the binary, and check what exactly it does at the time.

[15:40:50] <jim> some ISPs will confiscate equipment if they have to deal with heavy dos caused by the client
[15:41:07] <p0g0> I get the spam stuff, but this ISP already has such a low reputation that outbound mail from their IP gets me tagged as spam in a lot of places... so, I am not sure that their plan is really about anything but $.  If they actually managed to clean up spam from their public IP address, I might buy into the $5.
[15:41:11] <DrEeevil> jim: that sounds ... unlikely

[18:50:30] <varaindemian> can I create multiple windows of chromium abd then kill only the pid of one particular window?
[18:50:34] <varaindemian> or they all get killed?
[18:51:03] <matsaman> varaindemian: I think you probably can
[18:51:22] <matsaman> and even if you couldn't, you could probably use utils that grok window information to manage it still
[18:51:37] <matsaman> like wmctrl, devilspie/2, etc.
[18:52:02] <matsaman> varaindemian: something else you can usually do with browsers (Firefox, at least), is run them with separate profiles
[18:52:36] <matsaman> and ... I'm pretty sure people have figured out fairly straightforward ways to run entirely separate processes of the same technical browser

[20:05:57] <curdlesnoot> jiffe: it's easily explained. you have a pipeline in the LOGCMD function. the pipeline has two parts, one which runs eval, and the other of which runs tee. both of these commands will executed in two distinct subshells. in the first subshell, cd command is carried out, after which the subshell in question dies. the current working directory of the parent shell remains the same.

[23:44:24] <PaulFertser> ignapk: load_cycle_count increases also without powering off. When you're on battery power laptops spin down disks after a minute if configured to do so, and some are.

[23:47:11] <ayecee> like, something to be aware of, but not something you really need to micromanage
[23:47:16] <ayecee> disks gonna disk
[23:47:34] <PaulFertser> ayecee: yes, this drive is likely just a random accident judging by the smartctl output. One might probably start worrying when reallocated sector count got above 1-2.
