[03:59:29] <rickame> is it bad practice to put a hr after a header? it's a thematic break which hr is for, but is that already implied by the header so hr is redundant?
[04:03:03] <nbjoerg> rickame: I would use border or so for that purpose
[04:03:52] <rickame> well the nice thing about hr is the browser renders it
[04:04:00] <rickame> so even with css turned off the page is more readable
[04:04:58] <nbjoerg> who does that? I mean even for screen readers, you already get a wrapping for semantic elements like headers
[04:05:30] <rickame> ya true
[04:05:49] <rickame> im afraid to leave out disadvantaged ppls
[04:07:09] <nbjoerg> what I found is that the only way to really make sure something works for people with a physical handicap is to actually test it
[04:07:27] <nbjoerg> especially when we are talking about something more involved than a simple data dump page
[04:10:50] <Visage> I'm visually-impaired; please don't break my UX and expectations, kthx. :)
[04:12:23] <nbjoerg> may I ask roughly on which part of the spectrum?
[04:13:00] <nbjoerg> e.g. do you depend on assistance software?
[04:36:43] <Visage> I zoom in more often than not, and one thing that really annoys me is when websites disable zoom functionality on mobile devices.
