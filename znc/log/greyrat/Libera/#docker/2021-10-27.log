[11:27:24] <emx> programmerq, Hi. Do you remember my issue of yesterday being able to ping IPs but not resolving domains? On Centos I had to add the docker net interface to the trusted zone with "firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-interface=docker0"

[11:30:44] <Syzygy> i'm trying to run CMD ["R", "plumber::pr('server.R')"]. However the second command executes before the first has finished, so it's ignored. What can I do there?
[11:31:53] <emx> Syzygy, My suggestion: write a script or add "&&" between the two commands (given that the first command must return error-code 0 for the second to be called).
[11:32:25] <emx> ... but I don't recognise a second command in CMD
[11:33:15] <Syzygy> emx, it's supposed to execute from within R
[11:36:00] <emx> Syzygy, Could you please identify the first command and the second command? What I know now is that you run R probably as a server and that server is supposed to call a function. The nature of calling commands and functions is that (without any additional precaution) the called function (in R) ends and only then the calling function/process ends (R itself).
[11:37:28] <Syzygy> the first commands starts an R session, similar to running python session in the command line, the second command is supposed to execute within the R session.
[11:38:27] <emx> Syzygy, and you expect R session to end before the executed command in R ends?
[11:38:55] <Syzygy> I expect the R session to persist
[11:42:04] <emx> Syzygy, I see. Show me how you run the docker image.
[11:44:34] <Syzygy> https://bpa.st/3YLQ This is the Dockerfile
[11:45:01] <emx> And the command you run the docker image with?
[11:45:09] <Syzygy> docker run -it  -p 8000:8000 r-server:1
[11:46:33] <Syzygy> keep in mind that what I keep changing the CMD of the dockerfile for now. e.g. earlier it was CMD ["R", "pr(plumber)"]
[11:47:04] <emx> Syzygy, is that a public image? I can't find it.
[11:48:00] <Syzygy> I gave you the dockerfile for that image.
[11:48:18] <Syzygy> the dockerfile that creates the image
[11:48:44] <emx> OK, so r-server:1 is built from that Dockerfile.
[11:49:31] <Syzygy> correct. The only thing you don't have is the R script that is copied into the image. If you're actually try to reproduce this I can give that to you as well.
[11:50:40] <Syzygy> https://bpa.st/LWFQ note that currently I have install.packages('plumber') running both in the Dockerfile, as well as the script, because it keeps telling me that plumber isn't installed.

[11:57:18] <Syzygy> yes.

[12:05:47] <emx> COPY failed: stat /var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-builder094562417/oddpub_server.R: no such file or directory
[12:06:46] <emx> I suggest you create one docker file that handles the software part and another docker file that is for configuration/running R.
[12:07:02] <emx> That way you don't lose the builds just because a file is missing.

[18:02:28] <tabakhase> prob technically in the end simple todo, pipe to xargs and grep or so.. - just not a "once command" deal ;D
[18:02:53] <Windy> docker ps -a --filter volume=<id> ?  should that work?
[18:03:30] <tabakhase> actually it may.. but not sure if filter can descend that deep
[18:03:40] <tabakhase> kinda should tho...
[18:04:00] <Windy> i found that on a stack exchange post, but it returns nothing.  the volume may not have a container associated...
[18:04:30] <Windy> i may try a docker volume prune --filter volume=<id> which should only prune it if it's not in use, right?
[18:04:31] <programmerq> filter really only works with a few things. a small bash loop can help. just do this: for c in $(docker ps -aq); do docker container inspect $c | grep VOLUMEID && echo $c; done
[18:05:00] <programmerq> Windy▸ that prune command looks correct, yes. if you try to delete a volume that's attached, you'll get an error.
[18:06:50] <Windy> i like the idea of your bash script but it doesn't return, some syntax error maybe

[20:01:24] <kittonian> hi all. i'm wondering how people are structuring their docker network vs the localhost. the reason I ask is that this server has a public IP address and that is what is configured in DNS for various domain names. However, on the server itself I cannot use an FQDN because all of my server software is in various docker containers. Instead I am having to use the docker container name.
[20:02:01] <kittonian> this is generally not an issue, but it's a major issue when it comes to specifying mail domains from within various server software (i.e. nextcloud, various php stuff that sends mail, etc.)
[20:02:28] <kittonian> I really need the ability to use the FQDN for the mail server so that the certificate can be verified, but am not sure how to go about doing so

[20:03:30] <kittonian> btw, everything is running on the same server, but dns is from a different server (though I have installed bind on the main server as a caching setup)

[20:09:37] <tabakhase> kittonian mail&docker is an extra hump... - to some extend that looks like your elooking for a split-brain? may just be able to cheat that with hostsfile..
[20:10:52] <kittonian> tabakhase, i am just using standard docker networking with the bind driver and docker dns
[20:11:20] <tabakhase> for web, if you have just one IP, let a loadbalancer sort this out as mentioned above (traefik is one, caddy is often seen too in docker, also nginx but rather rarely (its dns support sucks a bit and no api))
[20:11:22] <kittonian> i'm open to suggestions on how to make this work so that from other internal apps I can use the fqdn of the mail server I want to connect to
[20:11:30] <kittonian> all the web stuff works just fine

[20:13:26] <tabakhase> email domain doesnt matter, just the MX
[20:13:39] <kittonian> right, all the different domains use their own domain for the mx record
[20:13:40] <tabakhase> and for "new ones" you need to alter the certtificate anyhow
[20:13:43] <kittonian> so they are all different
[20:13:55] <kittonian> even though they point to the same ip address
[20:14:10] <kittonian> all separate certificates (one for each domain)
[20:14:58] <kittonian> without docker, since the public ip address is the address of the server, everything just works
[20:15:16] <kittonian> with docker, i cannot ping mail.domain.com from the server, only from remote systems
[20:15:39] <tabakhase> and? doesnt change a thing in the point that "to add one, you have todo 'something' anyhow" - so ifg that 'anything' becomes 1 step more, thats what it is.
[20:15:55] <kittonian> fine, but what is the correct solution?
[20:16:59] *** Joins: withered_wolf (~withered_@1437135-v103.1561-static.stchilaa.metronetinc.net)
[20:19:28] <kittonian> one thing I considered is statically addressing each docker container and then using bind as the main nameserver with an internal vs external setup and creating the various domains in there, but that's a huge amount of work to create and manage
[20:19:29] <luva7> When i set up iptables in input output chain etc, docker will not care right? it uses its own rules in forward 
[20:19:57] <tabakhase> network alias should cut it pretty much perfectly...
[20:20:06] <tabakhase> and simmplest to maintain too
[20:20:09] <kittonian> luva7, it definitely cares. you need to use the docker-user chain for all the ports you wish to open. i would also recommend setting the default policy on input to drop

[20:20:25] <luva7> kittonian, if Id theoritically set up iptables -A INPUT -j REJECT will still let docker containers talk to each other
[20:20:30] <kittonian> tabakhase, cool. i googled for network alias docker-compose and don't see anything
[20:21:16] <tabakhase> https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#networks
[20:21:21] <kittonian> luva7, not only will docker containers still talk to each other, the outside world will be able to access your docker containers too. this is why you set the default policy on input to drop and then use the docker-user chain to accept whatever port connections you want
[20:21:22] <luva7> thats why I talked about specific INPUT, OUTPUT... it doesnt matter for docekr does it? kittonian

[20:22:10] <kittonian> luva7, i don't believe so
[20:22:30] <tabakhase> luva7 can you reword that to an actual problem/thing you wanne do/not do? - question isnt entirely clear...
[20:22:35] <tabakhase> (the inital one)
[20:22:52] <kittonian> tabakhase, i saw that link, but i'm not trying to give multiple names to a network. i need the fqdn to be able to resolve to a docker container, so i'm not sure how network aliases would be utilized for this
[20:23:11] <luva7> Okay, initial question. I noticed, that as kittonian said right now, docker containers are still possible to talk to each other and available from the internet even if INPUT chain is rejecting everything
[20:23:21] <luva7> So the input, output chain are not used by docker
[20:23:33] <luva7> that is correct in, any rules there dont matter to docekr and will not affect operation
[20:23:40] <tabakhase> luva7 correct
[20:23:48] <luva7> alright. Thats all i wanted to know for now
[20:23:58] <tabakhase> "if you want" to influence docker - there is the extra chain as was mentioned above
[20:24:02] <luva7> And I will set up as kittonian said to me in the specific chain of docker
[20:24:09] <kittonian> luva7, right. the input and output chain are not specifically used by docker BUT they do play a part in the overall security of the system, which of course influences docker as well. if you look at the FORWARD chain you'll see a docker-user entry at the top.
[20:24:15] <tabakhase> otherwise, as long as you dont break the NAT its all good :P
[20:25:08] <luva7> Alright, just wanted to make sure if I understood correctly, you both helped me good kittonian and tabakhase
[20:25:11] <luva7> Thank you
[20:25:50] <kittonian> luva7, also, as a heads up, i realized that when having my own separate chains, even though they were all set to drop various connections, nothing was actually working because I needed to add them to the input, output, and forward chains at the top, before the docker stuff
[20:26:12] <luva7> yes, I came to this conclusion also  the hard way
[20:26:51] <kittonian> ok, so now back to my issue
[20:27:27] <luva7> kittonian, im not sure, just flew over your problem
[20:27:30] <kittonian> how does aliasing a network name help me to resolve an fqdn that is using the docker container name?
[20:27:34] <luva7> but do you know about the swag container?
[20:27:49] <kittonian> no, never heard of the swag container
[20:27:53] <luva7> https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-swag
[20:27:58] <luva7> not sure if you can do what you want with it
[20:28:10] <luva7> but might be
[20:28:33] <kittonian> ahh, nothing to do with my issue, but it looks nice for some people
[20:28:40] <kittonian> i already do all of that individually
[20:29:09] <kittonian> i have a docker container called postfix
[20:29:32] <kittonian> instead of typing postfix in the mail server name, i want to be able to type mail.domain.com
[20:29:34] <kittonian> that's it
[20:30:03] <luva7> okay
[20:30:26] <kittonian> for example with nextcloud, it will send e-mail notifications. i had to figure out a lot of stuff in order to get it to work and basically had to disable all security for internal sending, and use postfix as the mail server name
[20:30:49] <kittonian> i would much rather just have it work with mail.domain.com so I don't have to do any of that stuff, but no one seems to know the answer
[20:30:58] <kittonian> and I would think this is a pretty normal thing to do
[20:31:57] <tabakhase> kittonian https://paste.debian.net/1217083/
[20:32:28] <kittonian> thank you for the paste
[20:32:34] <kittonian> i understand how network aliases work
[20:32:42] <kittonian> but that doesn't solve the issue as far as I understand it
[20:32:53] <kittonian> that just means I can use the fqdn to connect to that network
[20:32:59] <kittonian> that's not what i need
[20:33:08] <kittonian> i need a docker container name alias
[20:33:28] <kittonian> docker container = postfix
[20:33:38] <kittonian> mail server name has to also = postfix
[20:33:49] <kittonian> because that's what docker dns is using
[20:33:53] <kittonian> doesn't matter the network
[20:33:58] <tabakhase> it does precisely what you asked for, make other containers be able to resolve the full name
[20:34:35] <tabakhase> "doesnt matter the network" is not a thing. - connect the stacks where needed if those are multiple compose files ((declare the network as external: true on "one side")
[20:38:28] <kittonian> wow. you're absolutely right
[20:38:43] <kittonian> very cool. doesn't make any sense to me why that works, but who am i to argue
[20:39:50] <tabakhase> docker certainly has its quirks - and i dont agree with everything it does/how it does either :D
[20:48:38] <kittonian> well, i really apprecaite you just saying the equivalent of shut up and try it because this is how you do what you need :)
[20:49:00] <kittonian> off to do more stuff now. talk soon!

[21:19:17] <programmerq> bieb▸ you can do some pretty funky stuff to get a "desktop" in a container, but you really need to go out of your way to do so. a docker container isn't a machine-- there's no framebuffer. there's no bios/boot. it's just processes running in your host's already-running kernel.

[21:19:54] <bieb> programmerq: thanks
[21:20:01] <programmerq> you can run an x11fb to get a software framebuffer, and then use something like VNC to connect to it, but I wouldn't go through all that to just try out distros.
[21:20:27] <programmerq> that approach is really more handy for stuff like selenium test automation where you don't actually need a person to interact with the framebuffer directly.
[21:20:48] <bieb> yeah.. me either.. I figured if it was quick and easy I would try it..
[21:29:27] <akik> bieb: try webtop

[23:10:14] <gajus> Is there a way to copy docker images between two systems?
[23:10:25] <gajus> I have two Debian VMs running

[23:11:33] <gajus> I need to use `cp` in this case
[23:11:54] <gajus> and I don't have specific images, I want all of them
[23:12:08] <gajus> for context, I am trying to speed up boot process of CICD runners
[23:12:29] <gajus> I am evaluating if there is a way to just copy all the cache from one of the existing runners
[23:13:12] <programmerq> assuming you're just running an overlay2 driver, I *think* you can rsync or cp the /var/lib/docker, but I haven't tried it in a long time.

[23:58:51] <tabakhase> sure?
[23:58:52] <kittonian> i have a docker container running apache as my frontend. sometimes it's proxying to other things, other times it's just serving pages
[23:59:10] <kittonian> one of the sites is an awstats log analyzer that requires geoip
[23:59:28] <kittonian> i have geoip installed and working on the host just fine. fail2ban needed it as well as proftpd
[23:59:31] <kittonian> all that is good
[23:59:46] <kittonian> however, i'm not sure that geoip is working for awstats
[23:59:59] <kittonian> does this mean I would need to install it in the apache container as well?
