[02:20:17] <bobdobbs> Hi all.  I have two stacked boxes. I want the box on top to have a shadow that is visible underneath it, even when it has no bottom margin and the box below it has a background colour
[02:20:20] <bobdobbs> https://codepen.io/sunilwilliams/pen/yLbPqyY
[02:20:55] <bobdobbs> I'm sure that that I've solved this problem before, but I can't remember how
[02:21:38] <bobdobbs> In my codepen mockup, the shadow is visible. But it becomes invisible when the margin below it is removed.
[02:22:32] <bobdobbs> I thought that maybe using z-indexes would help: if I gave the top box a higher z-index, then the shadow would show? But that doesn't seem to work.

[02:28:04] <farn> "z-index; 200px ;" was probably supposed to be "z-index: 200;"

[02:46:09] <stenno> z-index is an indicator that your markup is crap
[03:01:14] <farn> well, what markup would you suggest in this particular case?

[03:23:36] <entuland> uhm... I see a shadow in the pen above, isn't it already doing what you want?
[03:24:21] <stenno> its adjusted already
[03:26:25] <bobdobbs> Yeah, I gotta admit - if I have to use z-index then I sense that something has already gone wrong
[03:26:34] <bobdobbs> but sometimes it just... solves the problem.
[03:44:34] <entuland> the alternative to using z-index there would be reverting the order in the markup and reverting the order they are displayed within the layout, so z-index is probably the least evil

[03:46:15] <entuland> I don't think there is anything wrong there per se - it's just an effect that goes against the grain of the default stacking order, which is arguably subjective - it happens to be like this just because they decided it to be so
[03:47:05] <entuland> in another universe they could have decided that the stuff that appears first in the markup gets stacked higher, reverting the x-index

[08:06:01] <scottwillmoore> Hi everyone, if anyone wants a challenge I've got a CSS problem that I just cannot seem to solve. It uses both CSS grid and aspect-ratio.
[08:06:51] <scottwillmoore> I am trying to create a responsive connect 4 board (7x6, square tiles), that fits the window on both portrait and landscape devices.
[08:07:00] <scottwillmoore> You can find the current example at: https://codepen.io/scottwillmoore/pen/XWRVrzJ
[08:07:37] <scottwillmoore> So far, it scales correctly when the device is in a portrait orientation but I can't find a way to make it work in a landscape orientation.
[08:08:26] <scottwillmoore> I believe it has something to do with the width of the grid, however I cannot find a way to make it auto-fit the content and fill the height of the viewport.
[08:09:35] <scottwillmoore> It may be possible to use viewport units (vw, vh), however I haven't tried this yet as I would prefer the solution to work alongside other content in nested containers.
[08:10:48] <scottwillmoore> In addition, in it's current state I get different behaviour in Chrome, Firefox and Safari, which may also indicate that there are browser specification compliance errors in some browsers?
