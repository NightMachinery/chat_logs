[00:06:15] <nshire> I don't know if hexchat interprets the acpi shutdown signal properly/at all

[00:06:34] <tomreyn> s/second/minute/
[00:06:42] <nshire> so it doesn't have time to send the shutdown signal, it just gets killed and then the connection times out

[08:08:18] <toddc> z1haze: the other option is reinstall with ZFS the learn and use snapshots
[08:08:33] <tango_uniform_xr> for backups to separate drive/partition i usually use rsync

[12:39:43] <jelly> toddc, it's specifically's Ubuntu's issue to make sure software has sensible defaults for Ubuntu users
[12:40:42] <jelly> and moreso, given the need to update sooner rather than later, that requires changes in packaging instead of relying on upstream
[12:41:56] <toddc> yes for the repositories, lts normally does not update but then this not a normal situation
[12:42:05] <jelly> precisely
[12:42:39] <jelly> now you're at the point where I was when I asked the question :-)
[12:44:06] <jelly> I'm going to ask debian to push the relevant changes to stable-updates; Debian probably only needs to add libera to the set of networks, I _think_ the client there defaults to irc.debian.org (OFTC) anyway but I haven't used a default config in decades
[12:45:14] <jelly> it's possible it uses upstream defaults; those would need fixing
[12:45:43] *** Quits: s1 (~s1@fedora/s1) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:45:49] <toddc> since we can add libera to the currnt version and hexchat is not a default installed program so I would lean toward not but it is not up to me

[23:19:31] <dc> Hi. I'm running latest ubuntu and have a monitor which should support resolution 2560 x 1440 @ 60hz, cable is hdmi. but settings only lets me choose 1920 x 1080. I have tried some stackoverflow answers adding new resolutions and assigning then using xrandr, and then cahnging in the control panel but when i do the whole screen goes black and i can see a smaller version of my mouse and it just
[23:19:33] <dc> flickers. nothing else works
[23:19:40] <dc> any help is appreciated :)
[23:20:06] <dc> at that point i have to restart the machine which seems to reset the display

[23:22:09] <oerheks> maybe 2560 x 1440 @ 60hz, is only viable with DP displayport
[23:22:22] <oerheks> .. or an premium hdmi cable
