[00:38:50] <gog`> and that experiments with it didn't lead to performance gains
[00:39:12] <sonny> apparently Cpython being the living standard makes it difficult for PyPy to catch up
[00:39:21] <alycidyne> sonny: that doesn't change the fact that it said 'slow language'. That alone is meainingless

[00:40:03] <alycidyne> sonny: perhaps, but it still stands that another implementation (JIT in particular) is possible, and that doing so is a human problem in most cases

[02:15:15] <pulse> <pulse> ProfSimm, opinions are like assholes
[02:15:29] <apotheon> In a system with both composition and inheritance, inheritance can serve as a significant reduction in boilerplate for specific cases of things that would otherwise be composed, which can help make code more reliable and maintainable.
[02:15:51] <ProfSimm> apotheon: if it allows diamond inheritance it avoids some problems and causes others.
[02:15:52] <apotheon> It depends on sane use, though.
[02:15:57] <ProfSimm> apotheon: both types frankly suck
[02:16:19] <apotheon> ProfSimm: If it allows diamond inheritance, it's trying to solve a composition problem with inheritance, and creating problems no code should have.
[02:16:38] <ProfSimm> It's just a badly thought out hack. Back when computers needed every byte saved, and simple static transforms were prevalent way of composing code
[02:17:03] <ProfSimm> apotheon: what is inheritance if not static composition
[02:17:21] <apotheon> I understand why diamond inheritance happened in the first place, but creating new languages with inheritance systems that allow diamond inheritance problems is not a well-considered strategy.

[02:54:26] <apotheon> NoSQL stuff will be reliable when it has essentially reimplemented the whole of what you get with an SQL-oriented RDBMS.
[02:54:32] <sonny> apotheon I think it's just for pedagogy
[02:54:41] <sonny> or maybe that's how it started
[02:54:47] <apotheon> sonny: People say that about SML, too, but it's awesome.
[02:55:10] <sonny> oh, for SML I heard that was an AI language, or compilers
[02:55:54] <sonny> I'm so far away from using concurrent or parallel programs and it's rather frustrating at this point
[02:56:04] <sonny> serial code goes brrr I guess
[02:56:14] <ProfSimm> sonny: those seem to replicate a lot of the traditional statement oriented structure of C/C++/Java
[02:56:32] <apotheon> I hadn't heard anything substantive about AI research for SML.
[02:56:35] <ProfSimm> sonny: mine's more of a expression-everything language
[02:56:49] <ProfSimm> With focus on a simple unit that's used for everything
[02:56:57] <sonny> pretty sure both ones I linked are expressions ...
[02:56:57] <ProfSimm> values, expressions, tuples, closures, classes
[02:57:59] <ProfSimm> sonny: dunno they may be but many of the lines here look like statements: http://gracelang.org/applications/documentation/grace-in-one-page/
[02:58:12] <sonny> yeah ... read a bit
[02:59:04] <ProfSimm> sonny: I'm reading but it even throws exceptions and has try/catch blocks
[02:59:20] <ProfSimm> sonny: the method structures are interesting though
[02:59:29] <sonny> oh that's what you don't like?
[02:59:54] <ProfSimm> sonny: not that I don't like it, but it makes me wonder
[02:59:54] <apotheon> ugh, Grace
[02:59:57] <sonny> it has all the common oop stuff but this one is made to avoid gotchas
[03:00:03] <apotheon> Inconsistent delimiter management always annoys me.

[03:05:54] <apotheon> Actually, I misread the code.  It's the code sample that's inconsistent.

[09:17:50] <InPhase> Affliction: Well, I think the core problem is that the Android (and iPhone) platform developers seem to be in a constant war with the app developers over what apps can or should be able to do, resulting in everything working in a variety of sandboxes with odd borders and rules for when things can be active.  This ends up working for basic apps, but is not as flexible as a traditional trust-level 
[09:17:57] <InPhase> security model.
[09:18:22] <Affliction> Yeah, having to protect users from themselves.
[09:18:59] <InPhase> Most modern Linux systems, on the other hand, start with a base of thousands of packages with a modest level of trust assigned to them.
[09:19:14] <amigojapan> InPhase: also just a lack of apps for say like google maps, or other phone oriented apps for linux
[09:19:32] <InPhase> amigojapan: Yes, that's the core problem.
[09:19:40] <amigojapan> it is usually up to "killer apps"
[09:20:05] <Affliction> That's true. Being in .qld.au, google maps was damn useful figuring out which roads were flooded over the last week.

[09:20:21] <Affliction> I don't know of an alternative that has the same realtime data.
[09:20:29] <Affliction> And, it's hard to collect such realtime data without a huge userbase
[09:21:05] <InPhase> Ordinarily a company like Google would just go open platform with such a project.  But here they have a vested interest in their own platform.

[16:07:31] <mason0> novs, maybe I am missing somethinf. while I dislike all-encompassing NULL as much as anyone, go doesnt seem very special in that regard, because languages that dont have that are rather rare

[16:10:06] <novns> pyzozord, bytes.ReplaceAll returned []byte(nil) when the body argument was empty, and it failed then to be inserted in the database because that field doesn't allow NULL values

[16:17:49] <novns> because what would they use instead

[16:20:13] <mason0> GeDaMo s cant  e NULL though, becauae it is an array. still, pyz's view is a bit c-centric. in some high level languages it is not clear what is a pointer/reference and what isnt

[16:39:47] <pyzozord> as far as I know nil or null are only for pointers
[16:40:07] <pyzozord> fundamentally each variable, pointer or not, is a set of bits
[16:40:32] <user51> maybe nil is just 0 in pointerspace :P
[16:40:35] <pyzozord> when all bits are 0, that can have a special meaning, or in golang terms "a zero value"
[16:40:49] <pyzozord> pointers with all bits set 0 zero point to address 0, and that is nil
[16:41:05] <pyzozord> integers with all bits set to 0 represent integer 0

[17:09:36] <jokoon> I can't hit services, not smart
[17:09:41] <Amadiro> jokoon, but the better option would be to just get the whole URL from whereever you got the string from -- thats better than guessing :)
[17:09:53] <jokoon> I would only have the string
[17:10:19] <Amadiro> Why's that
[17:10:20] <jokoon> length, yeah... reddit img links also don't have caps
[17:10:47] <Amadiro> Yeah, it's entirely possible that some given imgur identifier is also a youtube identifier
[17:10:50] <jokoon> Amadiro, well, for all the bad reasons

[17:18:44] <jokoon> I wonder if they wrote some C function to convert from/to an integer
[17:19:00] <jokoon> and implemented this function to their database engine
[17:19:18] <Amadiro> mobidrop, I think youtube IDs are pre-coordinated and allocated in blocks, UUIDs you can just straight-up parallelize, so it's a lot simpler with less infrastructure
[17:19:24] <jokoon> Im curious what kind of identifier they use
[17:19:36] <Amadiro> UUIDs obviously have some drawbacks like being terrible to type off, but if you don't care...

[17:21:12] <mobidrop> Amadiro, yeah but I think it's a lazy solution sometimes
[17:21:52] <jokoon> I tried to think about shortening geohash by prefixing the nearest city, but it was a bad idea...
[17:21:59] <Amadiro> mobidrop, that's true, but ain't nobody wanna run extra infrastructure and deal with those points of failure unless there's a return for the investment
[17:23:37] <Amadiro> jokoon, you can use a mipmap-pyramid of geohashes if you want (multiresolution basically)
[17:24:12] <jokoon> any example for that?
[17:24:24] <jokoon> or illustration?
[17:25:04] <Amadiro> jokoon, you just make the curve less fine-grained, which will result in each geohash covering a large area (being less precise). That way you can get very short hashes (if you don't need the precision) but refine later
[17:25:33] <jokoon> yeah sure, you just reduce the geohash length

[23:27:20] <nomagno> I usually take ideal encapsulation as a tool of proprietary software, and the particularly annoying kind. I honestly think providing encapsulation-indicating structures is better than actual enforced encapsulation
[23:28:08] <nomagno> Essentially, data structures and naming conventions that lend themselves to knowing when you're doing an ugly hack and it when you're accessing the intended parts of the API surface

[23:28:41] <ProfSimm> nomagno: way you said it, directly implies you consider it very important that you can do "ugly hacks". Why tho
[23:29:04] <ProfSimm> nomagno: this is not about being proprietary, it's about reducing coupling surface.
[23:29:42] <nomagno> I said I associate it, not necessarily that it is an inherent, exclusive characteristic
[23:29:59] <smallville7123> basically i have this https://imgur.com/a/OOBNlzv where the green square covers the entire view, and i want to split the green square up into regions such that where the orange square is would be "empty space"
[23:30:03] <BASHitup> What is the shell code to disown a process from the terminal and not print the output? 
[23:30:23] <GeDaMo> nohup or something like that?
[23:30:40] <BASHitup> ... I have a script that does one thing, then opens a browser Window and I'm trying to supress the output in the terminal, along with disowning the spawn.

[23:31:39] <BASHitup> Well, all pricess are daemons in Linux ... they're all called daemons 
[23:31:42] <EdFletcher> BASHitup: (where `command` is your command) 
[23:31:53] <BASHitup> and you can monitor them in BASH with systemctl etc 
[23:32:01] <ProfSimm> pulse: you inherit "behavior" only if you use an object as a whole, without ad-hoc patching it. Otherwise you inherit code snippets
[23:32:04] <BASHitup> systemctl <process> status 
[23:32:12] <flakland> lol
[23:32:37] <ProfSimm> pulse: composition uses an object as a whole, inheritance offers a bunch of ways to break that object.
[23:32:41] <sonny> GeDaMo any idea why this is a fork and not a hook in J? (>./ - <./)
[23:32:44] <EdFletcher> BASHitup: that's only if you've configured that systemd service. what i showed doesn't require systemd at all. also, not all processes are daemons.

[23:34:24] <BASHitup> Trouble is ... eternal trouble of technical people not using the linguistic expressions to convert said language to human readable form. 
[23:34:29] <ProfSimm> pulse: composition is like having a team and you being the boss
[23:34:31] <pulse> ProfSimm, you have a very skewed perspective about it :p
[23:34:39] <ProfSimm> pulse: I have a perfect view of it
[23:34:43] <pulse> composition is fine, but inheritance solves some problem classes way more elegantly
[23:34:48] <BASHitup> And we could go in circles about that all day. you guys to me are essentially human calculators with a full emotional spectrum. 
[23:34:48] <pulse> ProfSimm, that's bias
[23:35:09] <BASHitup> Tis bias on my end 
[23:35:16] <ProfSimm> pulse: I respect encapsulation, because when you don't respect it you get unexpected interactions, and undefined behavior
