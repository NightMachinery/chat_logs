[08:55:56] <adlai> cool, place ain't overflown.
[08:56:26] <adlai> I have a question that arguably is for this channel, since there doesn't appear to be one for discussing etiquette.
[08:58:00] <adlai> is it a lesser evil to notify someone that their contact info will be wiped, instead of doing so without giving notice?
[09:00:18] <adlai> /topic says to "Provide context!", so: the general context here is conversations with contacts in smartphone apps; and specifically, conversations that, upon review, seem increasingly one-sided.
[09:02:44] <adlai> for example, before deleting my Facebook account, I made a public post, and sent direct messages to a few people; looking back on this, years later, it's quite possible that folks who got neither notice could be insulted due to thinking that I'd simply blocked them.
[09:03:15] <Me-me> That's a cultural matter. Different communities and different cultures will have different etiquette.
[09:04:06] <adlai> sure
[09:04:55] <adlai> I suppose the politest approach is to never delete anyone ever, although then you die in a rolodex avalanche before you have ever been invited to take in the view from the tower of babylon.
[09:06:07] <Me-me> Contact data tends to be pretty light load in terms of storage. If I'm deleting data it's for organisation purposes - and in that case, better organisation, categorisation, keywords, etc, would seem better.
[09:07:10] <Me-me> That said, I can imagine scenarios where it's a symbolic or practical move - remove the temptation to contact one's ex is one I've heard is relevant for some people.
[09:07:21] <adlai> there are a few other situations where I might intentionally lose access to contact data
[09:07:24] <Me-me> s/move/moving
[09:07:25] <chat> Me-me meant to say: That said, I can imagine scenarios where it's a symbolic or practical moving - remove the temptation to contact one's ex is one I've heard is relevant for some people.
[09:07:27] <Me-me> Woops

[09:07:32] <chat> Me-me meant to say: That said, I can imagine scenarios where it's a symbolic or practical move - removing the temptation to contact one's ex is one I've heard is relevant for some people.
[09:07:47] <adlai> right, there is that one
[09:08:12] <adlai> another that occurred to me eventually is not wanting to have someone's contact information, in case a third party looks through my contacts.

[09:08:33] <Me-me> In any case, I can't imagine a scenario where it's better to tell someone you're deleting them. That seems performative, to me. "Look at how much I'm ignoring you," sort of aesthetic.
[09:09:19] <adlai> for example, I was given the number of a bartender by a shift manager, and deleted it after a while when I realized that it did not belong there.
[09:10:52] <adlai> I actually got a positive response once to a similar statement... the exception that proves the rule?
[09:11:05] * Me-me shrugs.
[09:11:14] <adlai> it was not quite "thank you, please delete"; more like "lol, this is actually good news!"
[09:11:14] <Me-me> As I said, cultural and community-based.
[09:12:06] * adlai has forgotten the details.
[09:12:38] <Me-me> This is just my own nebulous code of conduct.
[09:12:41] <adlai> I suppose it is definitely not a useful notice to send if there was no communication of any sort for a long time, say, years.
[09:13:16] <adlai> s/(of any sort)/$1, from either side/
[09:13:16] <chat> adlai meant to say: I suppose it is definitely not a useful notice to send if there was no communication $1, from either side for a long time, say, years.

[09:13:30] <chat> adlai meant to say: I suppose it is definitely not a useful notice to send if there was no communication of any sort, from either side for a long time, say, years.
[09:15:18] <adlai> maybe a good goal is to minimize the chance that I encounter such a situation again in the future
[09:15:40] <adlai> anyway, thank you for voicing your opinion, Me-me :-{

[09:20:06] <adlai> I am too stupid to waste their time with frivolous nonsense along the lines of "what is the most seemingly useful field of mathematics, that is actually of no practical use".
[09:20:26] <adlai> this question seems better-suited to ##not-physics
[09:20:33] <Me-me> Up to you.
[09:21:14] <adlai> there is also a ##math-offtopic.
[09:21:33] <adlai> they might be more open

[21:28:34] <hajonnes> 'I have put in (the application) for a new job', some words have been omitted, the ones in (). Is it the same for 'She'll put him up for the night.' ?
[21:34:31] <enick_937> It *might* be a contraction of "put in an application". Not sure.
[21:34:44] <enick_937> However, "to put up" seems unrelated.
[21:35:33] <enick_937> There are a lot of phrasal verbs in English.
[21:39:32] <enick_937> And even just "put up" has a lot of different meanings: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/put_up
[21:41:26] <FLHerne> I agree 'put in for' is probably a contraction
[21:42:40] <FLHerne> My guess is that 'put up' is in the literal sense of beds (in England) nearly always being upstairs
[21:42:55] <FLHerne> both of them are old enough that no-one seems to actually know :p

[23:09:14] <hajonnes> FLHerne, enick_937, Ok, thanks for your input. Good thought about beds upstairs. https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/167044/what-does-put-somebody-up-actually-mean-and-where-does-the-phrase-originate suggested among other things "She put him up (accommodated him in the loft of a thatched cottage accessed by ladder) on a shakedown (an improvised bed) in the hurl (the loft space over the kitchen)"
[23:10:21] <enick_937> Yeah, most of these probably come from long-forgotten contractions. :-)

[23:12:28] <kiki_faithmaster> Hello, I have a question: Which grammatic rule/wiser approach does apply in the usage of the indefinite article? I struggle fairly with the production of texts as it always 'feels' like a bumpy road because of the constructions with nouns and their appropriate article. E.g. the sentence: "He emphasised the irrelevance in such a study of any conception of a divine law." 'Divine law' could go without the article in my book, 
[23:12:28] <kiki_faithmaster> yet it is written like that by a british author. Are there maybe subtle differences between AE and BE or is it semantic, etc?
[23:14:19] <hajonnes> enick_937 agree :)
[23:18:51] *** braxas_ is now known as braxas
[23:20:03] <hajonnes> kiki_faithmaster, for me, not native English speaker, there are differneces in meaning between 'a divine law' and 'divine law'. So the 'a' depends on what you whant to say...

[23:23:53] <hoyhoy> If some of you have some time :D
[23:26:11] <hajonnes> blkshp, is it not correct to say "not a native English speaker" ?
[23:26:33] <blkshp> It is correct.
[23:26:52] <hajonnes> blkshp, but I should have added the 'a' ?
[23:27:05] <blkshp> You should :)
[23:27:30] <hajonnes> hehe... ok very good, to the point of discussion then :D
[23:27:46] <hajonnes> the discussion...
[23:27:56] <hajonnes> ?
[23:28:15] <blkshp> I'm watching a movie right now. I saw an error and corrected it and I'm happy to answer direct questions but not to follow a discussion.
[23:28:35] <hajonnes> ok have a good movie night!
[23:29:05] <blkshp> Thank you. I'll be done in an hour or so
[23:29:36] <hajonnes> :)
[23:30:54] <hoyhoy> blkshp which movie ?
[23:31:38] <blkshp> I'm not actually sure what it's called. It's an Australian film where there's zombies and his wide has been bitten.
[23:31:51] <blkshp> She's oozing orange shit lol
[23:31:58] <kiki_faithmaster> hajonnes, thank you! I was just thinking that the author actually means 'divine law' as there is only one you could refer to, yet he writes 'a divine law' as if there were several ones to choose from. In another sentence he states: "The law of nature now reverted to being exclusively on reason." An article in this case before the noun reason even changes the meaning of the word, completely.

[23:37:51] <hajonnes> kiki_faithmaster, of course I have no cristal ball, but I would say that "a devine law" makes sense to me in the concept of e.g. a world with many religions or that he does not academically want to marginilize the concept by only pointing out the anglosaxian (~Chrisitian) discurse.

[23:45:30] <kiki_faithmaster> hajonnes, interesting! It is not about religion, but more about an abstract approach and therefore couldn't it be treated like a specific term, the same as the word 'reason'.?
