[00:24:11] <ravindUwU> Hi there! I've got 2 EF core `DbContext`s in my project and therefore the dotnet CLI shows a "More than one DbContext was found" error.
[00:24:41] <ravindUwU> Is there any  way to "hide" a `DbContext` from the .NET CLI?
[00:24:55] <bpmedley_> ravindUwU : You can specify the context via --context, I believe
[00:25:38] <ravindUwU> bpmedley_, that's right; and it works! But in my case one of the `DbContext`s a base class to the other so I wouldn't ever want to use it üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[00:27:20] <ravindUwU> So `class Ctx1: DbContext`; `class Ctx2: Ctx1`. I wanna hide `Ctx1`, which has some common overridden logic, while `Ctx2` has the `DbSet`s that I actually need üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[00:28:29] <jonp> you can't hide intermediate types, unless you use "reference assemblies" or "bait and switch" assemblies
[00:28:47] <jonp> and then things get "complicated"
[00:28:58] <jonp> no idea why EF errors out if there's more than one DbContext, though
[00:29:00] <jonp> that seems weird
[00:29:29] <brianonymous> type conflict?
[00:29:54] <ravindUwU> hmm makes sense; jonp thanks!

[00:30:59] <ravindUwU> Oh BTW another question‚Äî`dotnet ef` seems to use my connection string defined in appsettings.Development.json, but I understand that this happens only if ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT variable is set to "Development" (which in my case, it isn't)... thoughts on how `dotnet ef` still picks it up?
[00:32:03] <ravindUwU> I've got an appsettings.json with the keys + empty strings, and an appsettings.Development,json with the actual development values substituted
[00:33:17] <ravindUwU> I do have a launchSettings.json with 1 profile, which defines ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT but I doubt this is used because launchSettings is VS-related ...isn't it?
[00:33:27] <ravindUwU> Or at least, ASP.NET Core? And not EF?
[00:34:55] <Nasp> brianonymous: I've watched all of  operation room, they are really good, a shame he havent produced more
[00:35:19] <brianonymous> nasp: totally agree. they are a fascinating study
[00:36:31] <Nasp> ravindUwU:  Why do you have more than one db context?
[00:36:44] <Nasp> Also it makes perfect sense it bitches about it

[00:38:40] <ravindUwU> Nasp, to override OnModelCreating with common logic (planning to add another DbContext)
[00:39:08] <Nasp> Another dbcontext?
[00:39:14] <ravindUwU> I'll have to specify it either way I guess
[00:39:16] <Nasp> What's in those db contexts?
[00:39:29] <ravindUwU> Nasp, yeah to connect to a different database?
[00:39:42] <Nasp> Ohh so you have different databases in your project
[00:39:59] <Nasp> So 3 databases?
[00:40:07] <Nasp> Sounded like you did some inheritance hell
[00:40:36] <ravindUwU> 2 dbs with shared OnModelCreating
[00:41:12] <jonp> do you have to use inheritance to share OnModelCreating()?
[00:41:56] <Nasp> Nope
[00:42:09] <Nasp> I dont see why you'd want to share OnModelCreating
[00:42:13] <ravindUwU> I guess I could move the logic to a helper class
[00:42:13] <Nasp> It's different databases right
[00:42:21] <Nasp> So what do they share?
[00:42:50] <Nasp> Also if they inherit, doesn't that make both databases... the same?
[00:43:05] <Nasp> As in same schema, where maybe on DbContext have more tables than the other?
[00:45:24] <ravindUwU> So... if a date column should default to GETUTCDATE() AFAIK the only way to set it is via HasDefaultValueSql?
[00:46:15] <Nasp> I just set them clientside
[00:46:30] <Nasp> But you can use conventions
[00:47:25] <Nasp> Does both your databases have all the same tables?
[00:47:57] <ravindUwU> My OnModelCreating just loops through the entities where clrtype inherits from the interface, find the property and sets HasDefaultValueSql
[00:48:04] <ravindUwU> Nasp, conventions for defaults?
[00:48:13] <ravindUwU> Nasp, nope
[00:48:40] <Nasp> Hmm maybe i'm wrong and EFCore never added conventions, can't find it
[00:48:53] <Nasp> But yeah would be better to move that to something shared
[00:49:07] <Nasp> Do you have 3 dbcontext then, one for shared logic, and then two that inherits from it?
[00:49:15] <ravindUwU> yeah lol
[00:49:25] <Nasp> So inheritance for the sake of inheritance :D
[00:49:25] <ravindUwU> maybe a bit overkill
[00:53:52] <brianonymous> youd probably be better off with a transform delegate
[00:54:50] <Nasp> Also i just prefer setting the Date fields client / server side (not database)
[00:55:38] <ravindUwU> brianonymous, a "transform delegate"?
[00:56:02] <ravindUwU> Thanks Nasp, jonp! üòá

[00:57:45] <Nasp> Did you figure out the appsettings stuff?
[00:57:45] <brianonymous> ravindUwU: thats one way, sure
[00:58:06] <ravindUwU> Nasp, lol nope; no clue how it picks up appsettings.Development.json

[01:59:06] <Harm133> Hey guys, I'm creating a little API. In the same project I want a backgroundworker that does some work every X minutes. Is this a good idea?
[02:00:20] <bpmedley_> Harm133 : Yes!!
[02:00:32] <Harm133> Sarcasm?
[02:00:55] <bpmedley_> Harm133 : https://github.com/brianmed/SpeedyCdn/blob/main/HostedServices/EdgePruneCachesHostedService.cs#L37  <-- This is how I do that..
[02:01:18] <bpmedley_> Works real well.  There was a new timer added in .Net 6 that makes this easier.  Not sarcasm..
[02:01:48] <Harm133> Because I tried my hand at one and now I'm running into memory leaks :)
[02:01:57] <Harm133> or at least, no GC in the backgrounworker job
[02:02:02] <bpmedley_> Hope mine doesn't leak.. heh..
[02:02:34] <Harm133> it was very subtle, but when I decreased the work from X minutes to every 5 seconds
[02:02:38] <Harm133> it was quite clear what was happening :)
[02:02:44] <Harm133> I'll check out your example, thanks!
[02:12:33] <Harm133> I'm a bit confused by the "return Task.CompletedTask;" call
[02:12:38] <Harm133> where does that return to?
[02:13:48] <bpmedley_> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio#ihostedservice-interface  <-- Harm133 , have you seen this?
[02:14:21] <Harm133> Yea
[02:14:36] <Harm133> Ah so the applicationhost will trigger it?
[02:14:41] <Harm133> or am I misunderstanding
[02:14:57] <bpmedley_> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio#timed-background-tasks  <-- I copied this example and modified the timer
[02:15:07] <bpmedley_> Also, yes, via the AddHostedService call
[02:16:43] <Harm133> Hmm, but does it get instantiated every time?
[02:17:02] <Harm133> I have a constructor in the singleton I use now, which holds some values that the periodic work will update
[02:17:03] <bpmedley_> My understanding is that the hostedservice will be around for the lifetime of the app.
[02:17:08] <Harm133> Ah that is nice
[02:17:23] <Harm133> since scoped services can consume the values from that specific singleton

[02:39:59] <Harm133> bpmedley_: Still leaking :(
[02:40:32] <Harm133> I guess it makes sense, as long as the object is not disposed it will not get released for the GC to do its thing
[02:41:29] <Harm133> so I guess that means your job also will leak?
[02:41:42] <bpmedley_> Is the memory increasing in a step ladder fashion?
[02:41:51] <Harm133> yes
[02:42:32] <Harm133> I've dumped the core, and checked it out. I have a bunch of objects just sitting there, getting initiated every time my job runs

[02:43:33] <bpmedley_> I was debugging with every few minutes.

[02:52:20] <_genuser_> bpmedley_ the research people are basically casting a wide net. So it's over linked and fairly certain not a scam. they'd have an expert come in and tell them, stuff like most of the windows source code is/is-not available. And how to find it. and then look at specifics with them. And that 12 isn't a thing yet.

[03:12:33] <bpmedley_> Where is the space actually used, Telgareith  ?
[03:12:47] <Telgareith> the Packages directory should only exijst while the solution is being built

[03:13:07] <bpmedley_> Telgareith : I see.  So, just keep the solutions clean?
[03:13:23] <brianonymous> Telgareith: compromise will the nuget pull on build, and then add a nuke dir for the end step. winwin

[03:20:39] <_genuser_> so the market is hot. all you gotta do is look for another job.
[03:20:46] <Telgareith> I'm looking
[03:20:51] <brianonymous> yeah, im getting that feel too
[03:20:54] <Telgareith> I'm terrible at interviews
[03:21:03] <Telgareith> but I'm getting better
[03:21:27] <Telgareith> one problem, if you can't tell, is I don't want to do actual coding all day
[03:21:39] <Telgareith> I want devops
[03:21:40] <brianonymous> one of my mentors once told me, even if im not looking for a job, i should try to interview once every 3-5 years
[03:21:52] <Telgareith> and everybody wants docker
[03:22:30] <Telgareith> I gave up too easily in 2017 when all people wanted from a devops guys was that they know docker exists

[03:24:04] <brianonymous> hold the phone, theres a html5 leisure suit larry?
[03:24:04] <_genuser_> forget interviewing every 3-5 years.
[03:24:10] <Telgareith> no
[03:24:15] <Telgareith> but I'd make one
[03:24:17] <Telgareith> XD
[03:24:21] <_genuser_> should be interviewing every 6mo, imo.
[03:24:25] <Telgareith> maybe webasm with Unity
[03:24:32] <_genuser_> keep a finger on the market pulse.
[03:24:33] <brianonymous> now there needs to be a sierra game engine -> html5 converter

[03:25:38] <brianonymous> avoid VC as much as you can if you do that
[03:25:41] <Telgareith> it's just some sprites and text scrolling /s
[03:25:42] <_genuser_> are you on linkedin?
[03:25:44] <irwiss> _genuser_: your browser or addons are probably fucking it up, my thelounge tab runs for weeks without any slowdown issues
[03:25:46] <Telgareith> yes
[03:26:09] <Telgareith> brianonymous: It's not a product I expect to make HUGE profits
[03:26:16] <brianonymous> even more of a reason then
[03:26:19] <Telgareith> its an idea for a retention management framework
[03:26:28] <_genuser_> irwiss I'm using chrome. So highly likely that it's getting messed up by chrome. My gmail windows also clog up heavily after a few days. And I've not changed the extensions I use in 10years.
[03:26:34] <brianonymous> better off just finding a rich dude who wants a fixed return
[03:26:36] <_genuser_> only the browser has been getting updated.

[03:27:45] <Telgareith> work is pathetic
[03:27:54] <_genuser_> Telgareith maybe I should move to firefox. although it's .... firefox. ew
[03:28:05] <Telgareith> except for the social stuff
[03:28:21] <Telgareith> I can replace both sysadmins and maintain my own position
[03:28:26] <Telgareith> here's a story
[03:28:32] <Telgareith> we're migrating a SQL server
[03:28:41] <_genuser_> Telgareith if you have linkedin, fix up the entire profile like a resume. Just as good. Details. Put your Technical skills there. And mark yourself open for work. Recruiters will start pinging you.
[03:28:50] <Telgareith> oh
[03:28:56] <Telgareith> I have 2-3 interviews a week
[03:29:08] <_genuser_> Telgareith start interviewing with all those recruiter. While improving your interviewing skills. improving what you have previously said. And then with employers the same thing.
[03:29:13] <Telgareith> I just get D/Q'd because I don't have docker exp
[03:29:25] <_genuser_> Telgareith D/Q?
[03:29:30] <Telgareith> disqualified
[03:29:33] <_genuser_> oh.
[03:29:41] <_genuser_> so devops requires docker experience?
[03:29:43] <brianonymous> arguably you should start studying up on it
[03:29:47] <Telgareith> absolutely
[03:29:50] <Telgareith> I am studying
[03:30:03] <Telgareith> but I'm very much an apprenticeship based learner
[03:30:05] <_genuser_> docker it something I'm keen on learning too but haven't really done so.
[03:30:15] <brianonymous> its dirt simple with .net... things go sideways when you start doing php stacks
[03:30:27] <Telgareith> so it's very hard for me to watch videos or read books without a tangible product in mind
[03:30:46] <_genuser_> clarification - I've done docker image creation, instance creation off the image, running it, resetting it, hosting it on Azure container registry, etc. etc.
[03:30:56] <_genuser_> but nothing in detail where you start seeing the corner cases.
[03:31:11] <Telgareith> I haven't even gotten the main cases yet
[03:31:26] <Telgareith> I'm thinking about hosting a flash emulator site
[03:31:49] <_genuser_> well I have done a sprint MVC/Boot based web service. It added two numbers. Hosted in a docker container.
[03:31:51] <_genuser_> just do that.
[03:31:52] <Telgareith> where its a, what's the protocol? RPC? connection to the container running flash
[03:32:03] <_genuser_> host a web service in a docker container, that adds two numbers (or whatever and return that.
[03:32:10] <_genuser_> next add in a DB.
[03:32:13] <Telgareith> I can do that
[03:32:19] <_genuser_> hehe. I have no clue how I'd handle the DB.
[03:32:31] <_genuser_> in docker, or in a separate docker, or just an azure hosted DB.
[03:32:33] <Telgareith> you need a docker compose file fdor that
[03:32:40] <Telgareith> or terraform
[03:32:57] <brianonymous> ive even seen dockers that build dockers
[03:33:15] <_genuser_> I've done some terraform. can't say I'm a big fan.
[03:33:21] <Telgareith> I'm currently disecting matrix-docker-ansible script
[03:33:29] <Telgareith> I'm a HUGE fan of terraform
[03:33:40] <Telgareith> it has it's issues
[03:34:09] <Telgareith> but slightly buggy terraform vs out of date documentation?
[03:34:12] <Telgareith> terraform pls
[03:35:06] <_genuser_> been a year already. so I've forgotten a bit. But if you make a change ot the environment that was stood up with terraform, omg, the whole thing goes sideways.
[03:35:10] <Telgareith> I think I'm going to start scamming microsoft
[03:35:19] <Telgareith> oh
[03:35:23] <Telgareith> yes
[03:35:25] <_genuser_> terraforms throws a bigger fit than brianonymous would if someone stole his popcorn
[03:35:29] <Telgareith> you have to be careful with state
[03:35:49] <Telgareith> forget what you know
[03:35:56] <Telgareith> read Terraform up and Running
[03:35:57] <_genuser_> hehe. I'd gotten very used to deleting state files, re-trying. And if not just blowing the whole env and redoing the application.
[03:36:06] <Telgareith> yea
[03:36:10] <Telgareith> that's not how you terraform
[03:36:21] <Telgareith> you `taint` the bad resources
[03:36:30] <_genuser_> my main issue was I wanted to be able to try things first by hand to see if they'd even work. Then code it up. And terraform would have preferred that nobody touch that environment.
[03:36:40] <Telgareith> you keep your eye on what auto `taint`'s stuff
[03:36:52] <Telgareith> correct
[03:36:54] <Telgareith> which
[03:36:59] <Telgareith> is the entire point :O
[03:37:20] <_genuser_> ideally you have two environment's. one where you experiment, the second where you code and update.
[03:37:41] <Telgareith> terraform deploy
[03:37:45] <Telgareith> terraform destroy
[03:37:53] <Telgareith> there's your experiament
[03:38:11] <_genuser_> overall, it was a decent experience. We handed over terraform scripts to the customer, they'd run them in pipelines and then run code release pipelines against that. and done.
[03:38:33] <Telgareith> yup
[03:38:37] <Telgareith> and
[03:39:07] <Telgareith> work is currently paying about $2000/mo to host our main income source
[03:39:23] <Telgareith> give me an extra developer and the reigns
[03:39:29] <Telgareith> and it'd be $200 a month
[03:39:55] <Telgareith> SLAs would be 30x faster
[03:40:04] <Telgareith> RPO's would be non existant
[03:40:30] <_genuser_>  hmm host it on azure?
[03:40:43] <Telgareith> and this is on something that processes 10k transactions a day of which we make $0.2 each
[03:40:55] <Telgareith> and thats not including the montly 'storage' cost
[03:41:10] <Telgareith> yes
[03:41:19] <Telgareith> work has a stick up it's butt about azure
[03:41:28] <Telgareith> I'm not too bothered about that
[03:41:44] <Telgareith> except when they talk about uh
[03:41:57] <Telgareith> TPM but its the server level
[03:42:14] <Telgareith> anyway, its $2500 a month on azure, and $1000 on aws
[03:42:33] <bomb> I can host it for you for $200 on Hetzner
[03:42:49] <Telgareith> no you can't
[03:42:56] <_genuser_> hetzner. is that your own cloud somewhere in germany?
[03:43:00] <bomb> it was a joke, dumbass

[03:46:03] <bomb> _genuser_ aye Hetzner and OVH/Kimsufi are cheap resource of inexpensive server hosting
[03:46:36] <bomb> _genuser_ I don't do no .NET anymore. decided to go minimal, and left several technologies behind, and focused on Java few years ago :)
[03:46:52] <Telgareith> would YOU be suspicious of a deed to your house if it had 2000 charachters of jibberish included in it?
[03:47:13] <bomb> _genuser_ I don't even bother to keep JavaScript in my arsenal. browsers are moving target :\
[03:48:11] <Telgareith> our corporate standard is "how do you explain this to a jury"

[03:49:04] <_genuser_> bomb very interesting. I'm trying really stop saying I can do front-end angular stuff because while I can do it, it's just more things to stay up to date on.

[03:50:48] <_genuser_> what I would like to see is fully encrypted disk and hosted VMs. With full guarantee that the provider can't go through the data.
[03:51:12] <_genuser_> so I can quit building big machines and worrying about backup. That way you just remote into a VM and work and also you can access it anywhere.
[03:52:28] <_genuser_> I know we could do that on an Azure VM or an AWS VM, but those will cost quite a bit with 24hr run. I'm thinking more along the lines of a Iaas/Paas type thing for individuals, maybe at 50/mo an upwards price point.

[04:12:35] <Telgareith> it's all so obvious to me I think I have to be wrong

[04:13:29] <Telgareith> when a single error can cost us $200,000+
[04:13:56] <Telgareith> hint
[04:14:16] <Telgareith> if your mortgage company ever sends you something and says sign it we made a mistake

[11:46:19] <MatthiasVance> But I wonder if the IRCCloud mobile app strips the metadata off it
[11:46:23] <bomb> DO EET NAO
[11:46:32] <bomb> upload to imgur, it does
[11:48:03] <MatthiasVance> Too cumbersome though
[11:52:14] <bomb> but your actual cat :(

[18:53:27] <moose> I have a few TiB of photos on there.
[18:53:32] <MatthiasVance> Also for shared in family?
[18:54:10] <moose> Do you mean like sharing the subscription to a family or sharing photos with family?
[18:54:53] <moose> If the latter, yeah it supports public and private links, groups, the usual.
[18:55:09] <moose> You can also make shared galleries which look decent.
[18:55:19] <moose> And if you already use Lightroom or something, there's a photographer subscription that is pretty dang cheap.

[19:01:02] <sysRPL> hi
[19:01:06] <moose> greetings
[19:01:19] <sysRPL> is anyone here familiar with gcc c builds?
[19:01:57] <sysRPL> i am having a problem compiling the quickjs c project with gcc as a shared library. perhaps someone could give me a few some suggestions?
[19:02:24] <sysRPL> the make it uses to build works, but only outputs a static lib i.e. libquickjs.a
[19:02:34] <sysRPL> gcc -shared -o libquickjs.so c-sources -lc -lm ... doesn't do it
[19:02:43] <sysRPL> https://github.com/bellard/quickjs
[19:05:11] <moose> A shot in the dark here but try placing -o libquickjs.so at the very end of your parameter list.
[19:10:50] <lz_> i tried firefox with ubuntu; tabs were eating my cpu resources like crazy, even inactive/hidden ones. can't believe firefox is so shitty performance wise
[19:11:20] <moose> You can thank overactive js on websites for that CPU utilization.
[19:11:33] <lz_> sure but at the same time edge/chrome mitigate this
[19:11:43] <moose> I have not observed that.
[19:11:57] <lz_> edge is "sleeping" tabs to disk. not sure what chrome is doing but it's doing it better than ff
[19:12:33] <lz_> ff has a similar feature but only does it "when memory is low" which almost never happens when you have a lot of memory
[19:12:43] <moose> Both of those have billions of dollars in data harvesting and marketing enterprises behind them, just remember.
[19:13:38] <lz_> I really love the container addon in firefox so I'll probably try to find some extension that works well for sleeping tabs. the one I tried I wasn't convinced, it was reloading the tab from scratch when I activated it
[19:13:46] <moose> Yeah, I have 4 GB of RAM absolutely free right now (wasted). 47 GB is cached files lol.
[19:16:27] <MatthiasVance> moose: Sorry, ehh. With Google Photos my wife and I had a separate library but could still build a "complete" library for ourselves
[19:16:50] <moose> Probably going to need to use the google or apple products then for such nice integration :p
[19:16:59] <moose> I like iCloud for this, but then again I am deeply into the apple ecosystem
[19:17:19] <MatthiasVance> I liked being able to tag people as well
[19:17:26] <MatthiasVance> I guess Apple has that too
[19:17:29] <moose> Yeah
[19:17:45] <MatthiasVance> Maybe I should give iCloud another try
[19:17:52] <sysRPL> nevermind i got it working
[19:17:57] <moose> You could go the oldschool platforms... flickr? lol
[19:18:01] <MatthiasVance> nah
[19:18:04] <MatthiasVance> I tried them all
[19:18:08] <MatthiasVance> Google Photos is/was the best
[19:18:21] <MatthiasVance> Until they removed the Drive sync thing from it so now you have no way of accessing your photos
[19:18:26] <lz_> I host my own stuff, I hate the idea of depending on a 3rd party service
[19:18:26] <MatthiasVance> (except exporting "Your Data")
[19:18:34] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Yes sure that would work, any suggestions?
[19:18:36] <lz_> if for one reason they ban you, you're fucked
[19:18:38] <moose> Yes, all of the off-prem in-the-cloud overseas-probably-not-sedcure facial recognition is great with the googs.
[19:18:40] <sysRPL> i had to modify the Makefile to add -fPIC to the CFLAGS
[19:18:44] <moose> secure, even
[19:18:48] <lz_> MatthiasVance: any cloud storage service, + I wrote my own code for versioning stuf
[19:18:57] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Yeah that's one reason why I'd want a 1:1 copy on my local disk xD
[19:19:02] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Ah so nothing special for photos? :)
[19:19:06] <moose> MatthiasVance: Lightroom does this :p
[19:19:15] <MatthiasVance> Does what exactly? :o
[19:19:27] <lz_> MatthiasVance: I never take pictures but the few I have are in some folders there
[19:19:33] <moose> The local copies plus with the adobe integration you can tag people and make shared albums it turns out
[19:19:34] <MatthiasVance> Also I don't need to back them up, I already have a backup, I just want them to be easily accessible and searchable
[19:19:48] <moose> Also they let you classify and search entirely locally.
[19:19:53] <lz_> MatthiasVance: in that case I'd go for sth like owncloud
[19:20:22] <moose> MatthiasVance: It also might be worthwhile asking the folks in #photogeeks for suggestions
[19:20:32] <MatthiasVance> Hm good idea
[19:20:32] <lz_> I dunno maybe google pictures is the easiest way, but then I'd use a separate account just in case
[19:20:51] <lz_> having all services tied to just one account is fucking scary
[19:20:59] <MatthiasVance> :D
[19:21:26] <MatthiasVance> That's why I'm the one pushing data to Google instead of having to pull it out, so I control the data :)

[19:30:38] <lz_> MatthiasVance: btw the day the changed the drive sync client was the day I removed everything from their stuff. I already had a self host thing but I rewrote it from scratch and put everything in there
[19:30:58] <lz_> google drive was already pure shit, so when they said they removed it in favor of sth else that was the last straw
[19:31:14] <MatthiasVance> yeah I did the same, if you don't allow me to easily pull my files out of your cloud .. what are we even doing :D
[19:31:24] <moose> It would be neat if storage was cheap enough to have something like github for photos.
[19:31:27] <lz_> funny thing is, I was using google's cloud services too, and I closed that account too
[19:31:36] <moose> Free, limitless, and just simple as fuck with all of the nice toosl.
[19:31:37] <moose> tools*
[19:31:47] <MatthiasVance> In my case, I don't care about free
[19:31:52] <MatthiasVance> I want the best solution first, then we'll talk cost
[19:32:05] <lz_> now I sort of need google drive back but just for maching learning
[19:32:26] <moose> I am willing to build you a bespoke system with every feature you need on a time and materials contract. XD
[19:32:28] <lz_> I'd rather do the compute locally though, I hate the idea of distributing my datasets to google etc
[19:32:32] <MichaelLong> the only cloud file sharing service I'm using is OneDrive for Business because of work. Totally don't like the inflexibility and general usability under Windows. I can basically only use it properly with rclone..
[19:32:59] <MatthiasVance> moose: If we're going that way I might as well do it myself XD
[19:33:16] <moose> Hey you said you wanted best and cost is a non-issue :p
[19:33:17] <MatthiasVance> Do you also do demolitions? :D
[19:33:33] <moose> I am sure I can figure it out
[19:33:45] <lz_> storage isn't cheap, I can't see how this could be free. btw I wonder how github makes money; maybe with pro accounts? then why offer free ones?
[19:34:05] <moose> lz_: That's why I said it would be neat if storage were cheap enough
[19:34:36] <MichaelLong> lz_, my guess: github organizations, e.g. my company uses it. but only $4 per user
[19:34:42] <moose> My company uses it too.
[19:34:59] <lz_> and free accounts help get ppl to use it and get used to it maybe
[19:35:04] <MatthiasVance> $4 / user is more than what they pay for disk/bandwidth I'm guessing? :)
[19:35:11] <MatthiasVance> It's not like everyone will be storing tons of data on there
[19:35:21] <moose> Yes, it's much more than they pay.
[19:35:32] <moose> They probably don't have bandwidth limits.
[19:35:41] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, sure. E.g. Backblaze B2 would be roughly $5 per TB per month
[19:35:48] <lz_> it's also a "free" code dataset for them to run their ml experiment on :)
[19:36:07] <moose> Private orgs are not subjected to that.
[19:36:11] <moose> Unless you opt in
[19:36:34] <MichaelLong> the problem with services like github is, they could become dumpster fires like sourceForge and many many other services.
[19:36:38] <lz_> I was talking about the point of offering the service for free and what they get in return
[19:39:00] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: How does one become a dumpster fire?
[19:39:23] <lz_> didn't sourceforge add bloatware or sth
[19:39:45] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, e.g. changing terms? raising costs. acting hostile towards users. etc.
[19:40:04] <MatthiasVance> ahh yeah so they didn't have a good business model so they had to "do stuff" and by that time it was too late
[19:40:05] <moose> MichaelLong: GitHub has been around for a lot longer than SourceForge or CodeProject was before they became dumpster fires. GitHub isn't a dumpster fire as is.
[19:40:32] <moose> I've seen GitHub get better over the years.
[19:40:40] <jonp> moose: yes, but neither SourceForge nor CodeProject were owned by Microsoft, either
[19:40:59] <MichaelLong> moose, I didn't said that and I did no imply it. but it is a potential issue with giving up services to somebody else in general.
[19:40:59] <jonp> GitHub can command resources, so long as it grows
[19:43:10] <moose> jonp: Sure. But I don't see it going the dumpster fire route any time soon :)
[19:43:25] <moose> In the future, it will, sure... but that's every service and provider.
[19:44:28] <moose> MichaelLong: You implied that code hosting providers uniquely turn into a dumpster fire in some way, but I just don't see it is all I am saying.

[22:26:56] <MatthiasVance> redoc: I actually remember something that was definitely a pluggable thing - back in the days - but not a floppy
[22:27:11] <MatthiasVance> It was solid, like a cartridge, but huge
[22:27:18] <MatthiasVance> Any clue?

[22:30:16] <MichaelLong> we will probably never find out
[22:30:18] <redoc> really? lol
[22:30:27] <MatthiasVance> In my mind it was something like a 20MB floppy disk xD

[22:33:34] <redoc> 10"
[22:33:36] <MatthiasVance> Seems to be a mix of floppy disks, hats and boobs
[22:34:14] <MatthiasVance> redoc: Yeah it wasn't a floppy :(
[22:34:30] <MatthiasVance> Maybe removable hard drive?
[22:34:34] <redoc> and it wasn't any kind of tape?
[22:34:54] <redoc> oh wait i think i know
[22:35:02] <MatthiasVance> No it definitely wasn't tape
[22:35:49] <redoc> nope nevermind

[22:37:59] * Suchiman remembers a zip drive
[22:38:22] <redoc> zip drive was my first "large" external storage, i loved it
[22:38:27] <redoc> stole money from my mom to get it
[22:38:50] <MatthiasVance> redoc: Hm SyQuest does look a BIT like it maybe, but hard to say because of the dimensions
[22:39:09] <MatthiasVance> If they always looked like that then it isn't one
[22:39:19] <MatthiasVance> Plus they seem square

[23:58:29] <Harm133> Hey guys
[23:59:36] <Harm133> Is there an easier way of getting claims for a user in a contoller in a web project?
[23:59:53] <Harm133> Or am I bound to using User.Claims.First(x => x.Type == ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier).Value every time
