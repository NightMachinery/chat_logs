[10:13:24] <labrador> Its batshit crazy to replace whatsapp with tg tbh
[10:13:33] <labrador> Whatsapp uses the signal protocol

[10:14:02] <iamak[m]> I have been trying for 3 years but people don't want to install signal just to talk to me

College it seems fun coz it provides sort of freedom from the life you had of school and home. then again individual's freedom comes with responsibilities. and those responsibilities are what people here are talking about being not

[11:16:30] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> * wait isn't this that crazy kernel dev who is going to remove bloat from linux kernel
[11:16:42] <theo[m]12> labrador: wait, microcode is included in the kernel?
[11:16:42] <theo[m]12> then, the amd-ucode package is something else?
[11:16:49] <theo[m]12> ElJohnSepiol[m]: yeah lol
[11:16:51] <theo[m]12> ingo
[11:17:09] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> > <theo.> wait, microcode is included in the kernel?
[11:17:09] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> > then, the amd-ucode package is something else?
[11:17:09] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> it is proprietary one i think
[11:17:29] <theo[m]12> ElJohnSepiol[m]: is it okay if i uninstall it?
[11:17:29] <theo[m]12> time for some fun ig
[11:17:30] <theo[m]12> lol
[11:17:33] <purpux> ElJohnSepiol[m]: Most distribution kernels have modules built in, so only those modules would be loaded. If you did get a huge jump in FPS, you probably did not install microcode for your binary/precompiled kernel correctly. You do get FPS gains with a compiled kernel, but not in the 200+ range
[11:17:36] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> lol
[11:17:55] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> purpux: it was minicraft
[11:18:07] <purpux> ElJohnSepiol[m]: Yes, I know
[11:18:12] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i have a kvm but i didn't put virtualization modules cuz i could just useanother kernel for that
[11:18:19] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> + i got audio, my keyboard, mouse
[11:18:21] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> to work
[11:18:24] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> xfce worked
[11:18:27] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> nvidia drivers worked :>
[11:18:56] <purpux> ok, but you don't get huge improvements like that from just compiling a kernel and removing modules that would not have been loaded anyways

[11:18:58] <theo[m]12> and the url points to git.kernel.org
[11:19:09] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i mean
[11:19:12] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> minecraft just works like that
[11:19:14] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> 💀
[11:19:21] <purpux> ElJohnSepiol[m]: fair enough lmao
[11:19:31] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i can get 2.5k fps in minecraft with 1366x768 on lowest settings lol
[11:19:53] <theo[m]12> ElJohnSepiol[m]: epic brrr
[11:19:53] <theo[m]12> try 320x240 lmfao
[11:19:58] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> ok lol
[11:20:08] <purpux> ElJohnSepiol[m]: wasn't there some guy who got 4k + fps on minecraft with like a 2x2 texture pack at 720p with a RTX 3090 ?
[11:20:13] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i play a lot of minicraft pvp lol
[11:20:16] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> purpux: yeah
[11:20:23] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> but thats not enough for a 3090
[11:20:33] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i can hit 3k fps on my 1650 super
[11:20:40] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> cuz i use optimized gentoo
[11:20:43] <purpux> He ran it on Windows unfortunately
[11:20:51] <purpux> ElJohnSepiol[m]: Lmao same. Hello fellow Gentoo user
[11:20:55] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> Lol
[11:20:59] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> hlo
[11:21:31] <purpux> ElJohnSepiol[m]: do you compile firefox as well ?
[11:21:32] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> so giys anyone use emacs
[11:21:45] <purpux> or do you use the binary ?
[11:21:50] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> no i don't my cpu to fry me meat for 2 days
[11:21:55] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i use the binary
[11:22:04] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> for firefox librewolf and ungoogled chromium lol
[11:22:12] <purpux> Fair enough lol
[11:22:14] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i have 3 browsers installed and call myself minimalist 💀
[11:22:47] <theo[m]12> > <theo.> microcode update image, it says

[11:22:47] <theo[m]12> i uninstalled amd-ucode, recreated the grub config, rebooted and artix booted fine
[11:22:54] <theo[m]12> dunno why amd-ucode is for
[11:23:01] <AryaK[m]> <purpux> "Arya K: are you running Xorg..." <- wayland sway with nouveau
[11:23:05] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> you went back to artix?
[11:23:12] <AryaK[m]> no i use void
[11:23:16] <purpux> AryaK[m]: interesting....
[11:23:19] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i was talking to theo
[11:23:38] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> AryaK[m]: don't the latest nvidia drivers work perfectly with wayland
[11:23:41] <purpux> AryaK[m]: is it smooth ? I always got errors saying I was missing .so files
[11:24:47] <theo[m]12> ElJohnSepiol[m]: yeah lol
[11:24:47] <theo[m]12> i did
[11:24:59] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> sed i still use systemd
[11:25:13] <AryaK[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: free sw
[11:25:24] <AryaK[m]> plus 495 didnt work with wayland for me
[11:25:25] <AryaK[m]> idk why
[11:25:36] <purpux> AryaK[m]: old drivers probably
[11:25:38] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i think it is possible to install openrc on already systemd installed gentoo
[11:25:39] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> is it
[11:25:45] <purpux> ElJohnSepiol[m]: it is
[11:25:55] <purpux> I think it's easier the other way around though
[11:25:56] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> is there a wiki page for it
[11:26:01] <purpux> uhhh
[11:26:03] <purpux> I don't nkow
[11:26:05] <purpux> *know
[11:26:12] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> they do
[11:26:13] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> have
[11:26:25] <purpux> You should try openrc if you have an old system
[11:26:34] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i have a modern system
[11:26:35] <purpux> if you have like lots of cores though, stick with systemd
[11:26:40] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i bought it for gayming
[11:26:43] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> 8 cores
[11:26:47] <purpux> ElJohnSepiol[m]: Yeah, if you want speed, stick with systemd
[11:26:53] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> oh ok
[11:26:55] <purpux> ElJohnSepiol[m]: SMT or no SMT ?
[11:27:03] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> its amd
[11:27:09] <purpux> oh ok
[11:27:19] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> idddddddddddddk if they have one
[11:27:32] <purpux> they do, they're all hyperthreaded
[11:27:43] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> oh lol

[11:28:39] <theo[m]12> and nobody i knew had an amd ryzen, everyone had an intel and an nvidia
[11:28:39] <theo[m]12> thank god i made that choice lol
[11:29:05] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i bought nvidia cuz gayming XD
[11:29:25] <theo[m]12> ElJohnSepiol[m]: loved it at a point of time,

[11:34:49] <theo[m]12> feels good, man
[11:35:02] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> lol
[11:36:41] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i forgot html
[11:36:50] <purpux> labrador: yep, you get some performance and RAM usage decreases quite a bit, but it's not what ElJohnSepiol described
[11:37:06] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> yeah
[11:37:12] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> even i use distro kernel cuz it just werks
[11:37:45] <theo[m]12> ElJohnSepiol[m]: you can always look it up tho
[11:38:00] <purpux> ElJohnSepiol[m]: Just spend the time to make a custom kernel config. Perhaps just once, then you can just carry it forwards into whatever future kernel version you want
[11:38:01] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> just google and stack overflow copy paste
[11:38:05] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> webdev ez
[11:38:10] <theo[m]12> ElJohnSepiol[m]: i would keep a distro kernel just in case if something breaks
[11:38:25] <theo[m]12> ElJohnSepiol[m]: kek
[11:38:36] <theo[m]12> purpux: the .config file?
[11:38:47] <purpux> theo[m]12: yeah, just make one
[11:38:49] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> yeah the .config
[11:38:56] <purpux> then on the next version, copy the .config file
[11:39:00] <theo[m]12> purpux: would do hehe
[11:39:01] <purpux> and `make oldconfig`
[11:39:40] <theo[m]12> purpux: gotta copy the config into the folder tho, amirite?
[11:40:25] <purpux> theo[m]12: yes, /usr/src/linux
[11:40:39] <purpux> or whatever you have set the symlink to 
[11:40:43] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> isn't /usr/src/linux a symlink to whatever kernel u seleceted
[11:40:50] <purpux> ElJohnSepiol[m]: yes it is
[11:41:32] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> if i had amd gpu i would have switched to openbsd lol
