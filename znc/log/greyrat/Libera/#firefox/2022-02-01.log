[04:34:18] <t4nk_freenode> and a crashed tab once, which is also pretty rare
[04:35:28] <t4nk_freenode> on a daily site
[04:35:53] <idwer> this is more like *poof* session is gone
[04:35:57] <t4nk_freenode> yep
[04:36:04] <idwer> :sigh:
[04:36:11] <t4nk_freenode> had that just yesterday or so
[04:36:15] <idwer> 95 is quite stable
[04:36:28] <t4nk_freenode> can't remember that ever happening before
[04:36:49] <idwer> a crashing tab can be restored, afaik
[04:36:59] <t4nk_freenode> sure
[04:37:39] <t4nk_freenode> but a *poof* is rather definite ;)
[04:39:16] <t4nk_freenode> well, I've been having some kde plasma issues too lately, but it's remarkable that I had the poofs too

[17:54:41] <Cork> they can overwrite navigation after first load though
[17:55:02] <Cork> (meaning second forward can be replaced)
[17:57:19] <MJCD> mm that's what I thought

[17:57:45] <Cork> your not using private tab or something like that?
[17:57:50] <MJCD> nah just normal lol
[17:57:57] <MJCD> I do use strict privacy etc

[17:58:32] <Cork> you could try creating a new profile and test if the same happens there
[17:58:45] <MJCD> it's on 2 pc's
[17:58:47] <MJCD> but same profile
[17:58:52] <Cork> what os?
[17:58:56] <MJCD> Win 10
[17:58:59] <MJCD> l8est
[17:59:28] <MJCD> I doubt it would be a blacklist tho because it DOES still let me get there and shows up in duckduckgo
[17:59:35] <Cork> try C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe -no-remote -profile %TMP%\test-profile
[17:59:39] <MJCD> so realistically it's like 1 click difference
[17:59:40] <MJCD> okay
[17:59:46] <Cork> won't affect anything except that instance

[18:02:27] <Cork> (else i'm not sure why you ask here...)
[18:03:13] <MJCD> newuser: yeah cork is pretty much correct lol just make a vid.html => <body><video ... ></body>

[18:03:29] <MJCD> and it's not redirecting
[18:03:38] <MJCD> and it's just this one url xD
[18:03:39] <Cork> well if you want to play a local mp4 you use a video player
[18:03:40] <MJCD> so odd
[18:03:42] <Cork> not a browser
[18:03:50] <MJCD> Cork: a browser contains a video player tho :O
[18:03:53] <MJCD> why install 2 things
[18:04:00] <MJCD> it's behavior rn is dumb tbh
[18:04:06] <MJCD> for a long time you could just drag em in
[18:04:12] <Cork> no it can get a video stream, but mp4 is propriatery so firefox can't play it natively
[18:04:13] <MJCD> now it just... redownloads itself?
[18:04:23] <MJCD> ofc it can, it can play anything the system can play ;)
[18:04:30] <MJCD> it's no vlc etc...
[18:04:37] <Cork> no it can't
[18:04:39] <MJCD> but anything is a-ok if you have the codec.
[18:04:41] <MJCD> yes, it can :P
[18:04:42] <Cork> not even close
[18:05:14] <Cork> firefox has 3 encodings it can play, and 2 it can support through propriatary plugins
[18:05:35] <Cork> last i checked it can't even play .wav files...
[18:06:03] <Cork> (not that any sane ppl would stream .wav over the net...)
[18:06:41] <MJCD> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers
[18:06:44] <MJCD> quite a few ;)
[18:07:00] <Cork> thats containers not encodings
[18:07:14] <MJCD> ... it will play using any of those
[18:07:32] <Cork> uh so you play your video with winrar? -_-'
[18:07:33] <MJCD> and subcodecs are down to the system level renderer
[18:07:37] <Cork> its containers not encodings
[18:07:37] <MJCD> that's codecs for ya
[18:07:46] <MJCD> containers, that implement....
[18:07:48] <MJCD> lol...
[18:07:56] <MJCD> it's a pretty moot argument anyway
[18:07:58] <Cork> containers is packagings
[18:07:59] <MJCD> where's my 1 url
[18:08:48] <Cork> h264 and h265 is encodings and those for example are propriatery and can't be played by firefox as it is opensource (license forbid it)

[18:13:39] <timur_davletshin> Cork, https://mastransky.wordpress.com/2020/09/30/firefox-on-fedora-with-openh264/
[18:14:45] <Cork> timur_davletshin: hmm is that a special fedora enablement then?
[18:15:01] <Cork> cause firefox has for a LONG time actively prevented decoding with that plugin
[18:15:20] <timur_davletshin> I believe so.
[18:15:28] <Cork> (it actually have a filter preventing decodings to event try to use it)
[18:15:39] <Cork> event==even
[18:16:00] <Cork> weird, well mozilla are mozilla
[18:16:52] <timur_davletshin> anyway, openh264 is slow and old in Firefox. For some reason they stuck with 1.8.x
[18:17:17] <Cork> kinda weird that only open source focused distros would so happily jump onto a closed source blob like "openh264"..
[18:17:48] <Cork> timur_davletshin: ya, cause it is only meant to be used for video conferancing
[18:17:56] <timur_davletshin> Is it not hosted on github?
[18:17:56] <labrador> isn't x264 free Cork?
[18:18:15] <Cork> timur_davletshin: "yes and no" the source is there but you can't ever use it
[18:18:21] <timur_davletshin> Cork, is it the reason to be slow?
[18:18:35] *** Quits: vukky (~vukky@wikipedia/vukky) (Remote host closed the connection)

[18:19:01] *** Joins: vukky (~vukky@wikipedia/vukky)
[18:19:03] <Cork> that is why firefox downloads it instead of just bundling it
[18:19:29] <timur_davletshin> Yeah, but Cisco provides 2.0.x
[18:19:36] <timur_davletshin> And it is faster.
[18:19:58] <Cork> labrador: no x264 is just an opensource implementation of the byte packing, you still can't use it
[18:19:59] <timur_davletshin> Anyway, there is a bug reported for that and no explanation.
[18:20:14] <Cork> cause again patented
[18:20:34] <timur_davletshin> Cork, you can use it. Firefox uses third party codecs.
[18:20:46] <labrador> Cork, oh so patents...
[18:20:48] <Cork> timur_davletshin: sure you can use a binary blob
[18:20:59] <Cork> that is kinda the point of this entire discusion
[18:21:06] <Cork> it is closed source blobs
[18:21:34] <Cork> you can't take the source modify it as you se fit, compile it and use it leagaly
[18:21:57] <timur_davletshin> Binary what? I have no binary blobs in my Debian and hone is noexec mounted, so plugins just fail to start. Yet I watch Netflix somehow.
[18:22:20] <Cork> what you can do is take the code, read it and "well that is fucked up" and then go oh well, and use the binary distribution
[18:22:33] <Cork> only option
[18:23:22] <timur_davletshin> So, in real life even license-concerned distributions like Debian can play h264.
[18:23:52] <Cork> as long as they are ok with distributing closed source binary blobs, sure
[18:24:17] <timur_davletshin> They don't use closed source binary blobs.
[18:24:25] <Cork> then no they can't
[18:24:39] <Cork> you can't ever build openh264 from source your self

[20:40:03] <Caspy7[m]> advcomp2019__: perhaps you need to define "check on a process" a bit more. Are you unable to open a new tab whenever that bad tab is open?
[20:40:49] <Timvde> advcomp2019__: whta do you want to "test"? If you want to report a bug, record a performance profile
[20:42:17] <advcomp2019__> Caspy7[m], yep.. i do see when have process explorer open, one of the the firefox processes eats up my 32gb of ram
