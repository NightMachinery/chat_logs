[00:57:00] <ville> using the ctor-initializer is not about "avoid a copy" really
[00:57:51] <ville> semantically the ctor-initializer list is/was the only place where you could _initialize_ a member variable. x = 0; in ctor body is assigment
[00:58:54] <ville> even though it may end up producing the same assembly, the language rules still say they are different things: initialization and assignment and you may end up in a situation where you must initialize for code to compile
[00:59:00] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[00:59:19] <Alipha> and if `baz` is not a constant, but instead something passed into Foo's constructor, you can't use the default initializer syntax anyway

[01:13:17] <RandomReader> pflanze - it's just normal initialization rules, same as    T foo ...    where ... is the same expression you use either in the member initialization list, or the default member initializer
[01:13:44] <RandomReader> e.g. constructor() : member{v}     is the same as    T member{v}
[01:14:31] <RandomReader> so nothing unique here about moves, same rules as normal .. which admittedly aren't entirely simple to begin with, but at least they're not different here!

[04:07:23] <RandomReader> my preference in general is to use    auto var = ...   with one of 3 patterns:  T{} for a useful default, like "empty" or "zero";  T{...} for logically filling in a value, like entries in a container;  T(...) for logically generating the value from parameters, as if I were calling a function
[04:07:58] <RandomReader> I'll use the same patterns for the member initializer list, but type member initializers are just annoying all around since you can't use "auto" syntax anyway, so those I just wing it based on what I'm trying to do
[04:08:06] <RandomReader> which is usually "= something"
[04:08:31] <RandomReader> sometimes that means repeating,   T member = T(...)    but what can you do

[12:27:38] <smallville7123> what would be a very simple way of implementing this?
[12:28:26] <TinoDidriksen> You can use va-args to simulate overloading macros, but why?
[12:28:34] <TinoDidriksen> Why are you using macros at all?

[12:29:43] <TinoDidriksen> If you want to expand even if there's missing arguments, that's effectively overloading.
[12:30:07] <smallville7123> im writing a C pre-processor for a custom language
[12:30:56] <TinoDidriksen> You can just re-use the C preprocessor.

[12:34:10] <TinoDidriksen> Also, if you're adding code generation, adding the C/C++ preprocessor is not a good idea. That's one of the worst examples of macro/codegen.
[12:35:10] <smallville7123> im writing my own subset of the GLSL language which is based on a subset of C and included the C preprocessor

[12:37:54] <anyone> The only reason I can think of that GLSL may want a preprocessor is because it's conceivable it might emit C/C++/etc. code that happens to have preproc statements that eventually need to be resolved.
[12:40:49] <smallville7123> the spec seems to justify this as:
[12:41:08] <smallville7123> • The extension mechanism relies on the preprocessor so this would need to be replaced.
[12:41:08] <smallville7123> • The #define, #ifdef, #ifndef, #elsif and #endif constructs are commonly used for managing different versions and for include guards.
[12:41:08] <smallville7123> • There is no template mechanism in GLSL ES so macros are often used instead.

[14:22:06] <anyone> When vector<T> has to resize, what would it commonly do when one of the T(T&&) invocations throws?
[14:23:19] <PJBoy> it copies the elements if T(T&&) is not noexcept
[14:23:26] <PJBoy> unless there's no copy ctor
[14:23:43] <anyone> in which case... it just yolos it?
[14:24:08] <anyone> (I really remember seeing vector doing copies, but it does not prevent compilation when copyctor is e.g. deleted)

[14:29:15] <PJBoy> except constexpr expressions aren't required to diagnose unspecified behaviour
[14:29:37] <PJBoy> but then this is in a stdlib function, so it wouldn't be diagnosed anyway
[14:32:13] <furrymcgee> it is not undefined behaviour, you can catch the exception and use the vector even if the state is unspecified

[18:42:32] <pflanze> OK, fair enough.
[18:43:01] <PJBoy> figuring out the best way to do this kind of "customisation point" is still a hot topic FWIW
[18:43:34] <PJBoy> I'm surprised hash didn't end up being an ADL type thing
[18:43:40] <PJBoy> like size/begin etc
[18:44:00] <pflanze> I wonder if anyone ever reported needing a cache on a builtin type (that also wouldn't have been OK stored as a global).
[18:44:40] <PJBoy> the hash in question could be something generic that doesn't care about the specific type
[18:44:45] <Alipha> pflanze: what does your Symbol struct look like?
[18:44:57] <PJBoy> and hence would cover builtin types
[18:45:18] <pflanze> Alipha, it contains an integer type and a boolean.
[18:49:01] <pflanze> Ah, I can provide the hashing and equality types to the unordered_map template; I guess then I can at least save myself the head spin around template instantiation inside std.
[18:58:14] <pflanze> I'm getting "error: non-static const member ‘const uint8_t Symbol::is_upper’, cannot use default assignment operator" when trying to copy a Symbol. Why can it not copy an uint8_t?
[18:59:28] <GyrosGeier> the default operator= would overwrite all members in turn
[18:59:36] <GyrosGeier> this member is const, so it cannot be overwritten
[19:00:22] <pflanze> Oh my, but it's about copying the whole Symbol. I think of that as replacing it. And the slot holding the whole Symbol is not const.
[19:00:51] <GyrosGeier> you copy a whole symbol by copying its members, recursively
[19:00:57] *** Joins: sa02irc (~mbax@155-079-043-212.ip-addr.inexio.net)
[19:01:07] <GyrosGeier> and you assign a while symbol by assigning its members, recursively
[19:01:18] <GyrosGeier> that's what the default copy constructor and assignment operator do
[19:01:41] <GyrosGeier> the default copy constructor has no problem, because the member is initialized as part of the initializer list
[19:01:47] <urdh> const members are generally very awkward
[19:01:50] <pflanze> Yes, I get that, it's just surprising, because I think of such a replacement as a wholesale thing, not on members.
[19:02:19] <urdh> you typically want to enforce that invariant implicitly instead, precisely for this reason
[19:03:06] <pflanze> I'm also surprised because I thought the default operation for copying structs is simply a memcpy, like in C.
[19:03:23] <urdh> only for trivially copyable types
[19:03:37] <GyrosGeier> you could define Symbol &Symbol::operator=(Symbol const &rhs) { void *memory = reinterpret_cast<void *>(this); this->~Symbol(); return *new(memory) Symbol(rhs); }

[19:03:53] <GyrosGeier> I mean, it works, but it is wrong
[19:04:21] <pflanze> So, I don't use const then?
[19:04:25] <GyrosGeier> memcpy requires the destination to be non-const
[19:04:47] <urdh> yeah don't use const

[19:05:20] <urdh> if it's important that the member does not change, it should be private and your member functions should just not change it
[19:08:05] <pflanze> GyrosGeier, memcpy would not have a problem here since the slot holding my Symbol is not const; only its members were.  Symbol a; const Symbol b { .. }; a = b; or memcpy(&a, &b, sizeof(Symbol))
[19:08:31] <pflanze> And I'm not sure but I thought C would allow the a = b just fine here.
[19:09:27] <pflanze> So I'm filing this in things to look out for when porting C to C++.

[19:16:00] <CodeMouse92> I've always preferred type alignment (https://dev.to/codemouse92/cc-pointer-alignment-style-a-justification-13po), but I also appreciate the counterpoint in the comments :)

[19:17:37] <GyrosGeier> that's why I write * and & next to the variable name
[19:17:51] <urdh> once you realize that the "declaring multiple variables" case is irrelevant, aligning with the type becomes a no-brainer tbh

[19:21:44] <pflanze> urdh, interesting, I wasn't aware of that; I guess I only used initialization by another struct, not assignment, in such cases.

[19:22:09] <urdh> copy construction works fine in both C and C++ even with const members
