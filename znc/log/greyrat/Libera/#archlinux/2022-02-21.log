[00:46:39] <evilpyro> Hello, tomorrow I'm starting in a new job and my boss has asked me to bring a linux live usb If I have a distro of preference, I was thinking of installing arch but since Its been a long time since i installed it, and I just follow the docs, maybe using archinstall is the best option. Or so I thought... I tried it on a virtualbox machine and everything seemed alright until I rebooted and i got "Error: Invalid cluster 0" just after the Loading 
[00:46:39] <evilpyro> initial ramdisk message
[00:47:24] <evilpyro> does anyone know what could have been wrong? I literally just booted into the live usb and ran archinstall, no extra steps

[00:52:14] <Feri> The mute led is not on but the volume drops to 0%

[07:47:51] <mpan> Bisdro: currently they are reporting an error on something that doesn’t look like Arch. Giving a benefit of doubt and assuming it’s really just a blackarch repo added, there is quite noticeable inconsistence between the mirrors they report, what the said mirrors actually contain and what is visible in the screenshots.

[07:50:15] <mpan> Corshine: having said that, “mirror.telkomuniversity.ac.id” seems broken.
[07:51:22] <mpan> It seems their database is older than the files they actually serve.

[08:58:07] <cedb> oh yeah, it s just i dont see what the purpose of having an automated timer+service if you manually replace the file anyways
[08:58:32] <cedb> just seems like conflicting advice na mean?
[08:58:34] <mpan> No, you overwrite your own mirrorlist, not the pacman’s mirrorlist.
[08:59:18] <mpan> The examples overwrite “/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist”, which is a part of the pacman package. You may instead overwrite your own mirrorlist.
[08:59:45] <cedb> ahh
[09:00:05] <thurstylark> the mirrorlist is shipped in its own package
[09:00:13] <mpan> thurstylark++
[09:00:21] <mpan> Right, which is a part of pacman-mirrorlist package. :)

[09:01:04] <thurstylark> which is why reflector is setup the way it is by default
[09:01:42] <cedb> i still think the Usage warning kind of contradicts the fact that all the examples are under the section "automation" on the wiki
[09:01:46] <mpan> The warning is about reflector overwriting that file, not pacman. reflector will happily overwrite anything you ask it to overwrite. Hence the warning.

[09:04:43] <cedb> ill go RTFM on how to include my own mirrorlist "with higher priority" file generated by reflector in pacman
[09:05:47] <mpan> There is no higher priority.
[09:05:54] <cedb> oh
[09:06:22] <mpan> pacman uses THE mirrorlist it is configured to use. It has no builtins that has to be overriden.

[09:07:05] *** Joins: ursatempest (~ursatempe@user/ginko)
[09:07:29] <mpan> Strictly speaking “mirrorlist” is a human concept in this case: pacman is just including `Server=` options from another file. They may as well be defined in pacman.conf directly, though that is inconvenient.
[09:07:31] <cedb> I though pacman usd the first mirror in line order in the file that works
[09:08:10] <cedb> so youd want the fastest/unreliable first and the most reliable after kind of thing
[09:08:13] <mpan> It uses `Server=` lines in order they are present in the configuration file for the given repository.
[09:08:52] <mpan> That is a weird notion. Aside from the question of having more than one mirror at all, having unreliable mirrors first is even weirder. :)

[21:14:29] <red_> what irc clients does everyone like to use?
[21:14:45] <angelsl> how does that work tho, this is an odd failure mode 
[21:14:53] <d42> i'm thinking, geforce now wants to run in full screen only, but i want it windowed. i tried running it inside Xephyr but i had issues with the mouse cursor 
[21:15:02] <d42> what do you think, fellow archlinux users 🤔
[21:15:13] <angelsl> also, if libseccomp is broken i would expect more issues across the system
[21:16:16] <Namarrgon> the application itself configures the seccomp filters
[21:17:05] <angelsl> yes, i know, but i can't really fathom how that leads to such a specific failure
[21:17:09] <mpan> bin: yes. Is thanking a community “just that”?
[21:17:10] <Namarrgon> red_: cli? irssi/weechat. gui? hexchat. the wiki has a list of applications you cnan slog through and test all of them
[21:17:32] <angelsl> the rest of firefox uses seccomp too, but it doesn't seem like anything esle is broken
[21:17:49] <angelsl> parts of systemd also uses seccomp, systemd doesn't seem broken
[21:17:52] <red_> Mamarrgon: yeah I have it. I'm pretty much a terminal newbie but I'm not opposed to running it kb only.
[21:17:53] <angelsl> also use*
[21:18:06] <red_> I'm on konversation right now but it's ugly..
[21:18:22] <Namarrgon> angelsl: it's using different filters, not everything would necessarily  explode at the same time
[21:18:28] <Namarrgon> i'm just guessing anyway
[21:18:52] <red_> I don't mind using a cli based client, sounds very comfortable. I just have to memorize the shortcuts like anything else.
[21:18:54] <angelsl> hmm, the way libseccomp works, i don't really expect it to just break for certain filters lol
[21:18:55] <Namarrgon> d42: what exactly doesn't run in fullscreen? "geforce"?
[21:19:24] <angelsl> i presume you know how libseccomp works?

[22:50:26] <Namarrgon> weltio: are you sure this was generated by the same makepkg call?
[22:50:52] <Namarrgon> weltio: which package owns the already existing file?
[22:51:10] <lambda> Namarrgon: the file is in the builddir, probably not owned by anything
[22:51:11] <weltio> Namarrgon: its in the builddir - no packacge owns that
[22:51:14] <Namarrgon> Chocobo: do you use DE?
[22:51:34] <lambda> i.e. debug-prefix-map didn't work
[22:51:37] <BrainDamage> Namarrgon: debug strip does behave like that, it generates 2 packages, one with the debug symbols and one without
[22:51:52] <weltio> lambda: i see, makes sense, but at which point would that occur? from my pov it looks fine 
[22:52:06] <BrainDamage> and both should be in pkgdest
[22:52:29] <Namarrgon> BrainDamage: yes but the symbols should be moved  in either case, !strip and strip, to $pkgdir
[22:52:35] <Chocobo> Namarrgon: I am using i3 (Regolith). I think the answer is "No"
[22:52:47] * Namarrgon looks up regolith
[22:52:50] <lambda> weltio: DEBUG_C(XX)FLAGS should contain an -fdebug-prefix-map directive what is passed to GCC to rewrite the paths in the debug info from the builddir to /usr/src/debug

[23:28:09] <evilpyro> hi, Is there a way to uninstall gnome-extra without uninstalling gnome? I want a basic gnome install

[23:30:26] <ramblebamble> evilpyro, I havn't looked at the packages in that group but `pacman -Rss` might be a good place to start
[23:30:50] <j-james> evilpyro: i have gnome installed without gnome-extra, so i'd suspect just removing the packages is fine
[23:31:20] <j-james> lambda: iptables shows INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT as policy ACCEPT
[23:31:37] <lambda> j-james: no firewall then
[23:31:48] <evilpyro> j-james, well, but I dont really want to uninstall one by one, I was wondering if theres a smarter way
[23:32:30] <lambda> evilpyro: what happens when you do pacman -Rss gnome-extra?
[23:32:32] <j-james> evilpyro: i believe there's a command to uninstall a group - check pacman -R --help
[23:33:10] <j-james> ^^ what lambda said
[23:33:20] <evilpyro> lambda, It aks if i want to uninstall gnome-tweaks
[23:33:40] <evilpyro> only that package
[23:33:55] <lambda> evilpyro: are you sure you have any other packages from that group installed?
[23:34:09] <lambda> j-james: so your server is running, right? is it listed in ss -ltnp?

[23:35:47] <j-james> it was running when i did the nmap scan though
[23:35:57] <evilpyro> lambda, Well, I just have so much extra packages, like a software app to install packages, calendar, music player, etc
[23:36:24] <j-james> ss -ltnp now shows a listener on *:25565 which seems right
[23:36:27] <lambda> evilpyro: all of those are in `gnome`
[23:37:01] <evilpyro> wtf

[23:37:31] <lambda> j-james: alright, so you should be able to do `nc localhost 25565`
