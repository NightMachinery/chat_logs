[04:06:16] <artao> Lady: Why did you right that?
[04:06:29] <artao> Dude: I didn't write it. Paul McCartney wrote it. The Beatles?
[04:06:33] <artao> Everyone: Who?
[04:06:43] <artao> ^^ basic premise of the movie
[04:07:01] <artao> he's in a bike accident and when he comes to the Beatles never existed, but he remembers all their songs
[04:07:04] <artao> perfectly

[04:12:50] <murthy> Just4laughs have released their music for sale, but I can't find it in their listing
[04:13:16] <murthy> imho thats an awesome guitar cover of house of the rising sun
[04:15:07] <artao> at the risk of sounding egotistical, i do (well, used to do, but probably still can .. mostly ..) a SWEET rendition of House Of the Rising Sun on trumpet

[04:16:07] <murthy> artao: You can so that with a trumpet?
[04:16:13] <murthy> artao: also don't for now
[04:16:18] <artao> some jerks in an apartment across the street from where I generally played trumpet would always blast Miles Davis out the window to fuck with me

[04:16:26] <murthy> the dust has settled now only
[04:16:40] <murthy> :D
[04:16:41] <artao> "you can so that .." ....... uh ... .typo?
[04:16:43] <artao> i assume
[04:16:48] <artao> cuz that sentence makes no sense
[04:17:18] <artao> hmm ... i wonder
[04:17:36] <murthy> I am going to eat something and go to bed
[04:17:38] <artao> i DO play it quite low. which is easier than high notes
[04:17:44] <murthy> you all have a nice day
[04:17:49] <murthy> see you all later

[04:48:14] <artao> my computer
[04:48:15] <artao> :P
[04:48:15] <louipc> or just phone/computer thing
[04:48:16] <artao> no
[04:49:09] <artao> the mic is an el' cheapo Neewer NW-700 that came as a package with the boom arm mic mount
[04:49:14] <louipc> cool
[04:49:58] <artao> into a Behringer Xenyx 1002B, then the mains from that into my computer via focusrite scarlett 2i4 2nd gen
[04:50:18] <artao> the mic is surprisingly good (to me) for being total crap LOL
[04:50:28] <artao> i intend to SOON buy a Shure SM57
[04:50:46] <artao> that is actually the first time i've tried recording trumpet with this mic
[04:51:00] <artao> it had to be like 3 ft away from me to not redline
[04:51:09] <louipc> kool i got a scarlett too
[04:51:09] <artao> :O
[04:51:17] <artao> an SM57 would suit me well methinx
[04:51:21] <artao> which one?
[04:51:30] <artao> their drivers kinda suck. i'm disappointed
[04:51:31] <louipc> same
[04:51:38] <artao> next interface i'll try another brand
[04:51:45] <louipc> i didnt use it much tbh

[04:53:05] <artao> how ?
[04:53:06] <artao> o.O
[04:53:11] <artao> mine is always in use
[04:53:22] <artao> in fact, due to how it's all hooked up, it never turns off
[04:53:31] <louipc> that was about the time i yeeted out of music
[04:54:02] <artao> computer into audio interface, ch1&2 from that into mixer, mixer master out back into audio interface (1/4" plugs) and also out to my amp (RCA plugs)

[18:31:02] <jazz> i would probably choose the stereo version because I like mixes with hard pans left/right 
[18:31:40] <jazz> on my home setup. but the mono mix for my phone/car

[18:35:51] <murthy> jazz: ya
[18:36:39] <jazz> some versions are cheap. but I just looked on discogs for the uk mono on vinyl and the cheapest I see is $200 lol
[18:36:39] <murthy> Corporate bastards
[18:37:06] <jazz> the beatles weren't even on itunes for a long time because of a copyright dispute with their original label (Apple Records)
