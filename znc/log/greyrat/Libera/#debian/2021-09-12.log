[00:13:42] <yetkind> ahhh ddd
[00:13:47] <yetkind> thank you
[00:14:19] <somiaj> xft fonts made things way easier, just took a long time as anything in linux to be widly adopted
[00:14:50] <somiaj> fvwm supports both bitmap and xft fonts, so you can use the old ones for the retro look if you want, and motiff
[00:14:55] <knotMez> xcolsel, xfd and xfontsel
[00:15:35] <knotMez> somiaj for the most part I'm no fan of old bitmapped fonts some old programs still use them though
[00:15:55] <knotMez> I only have the bitmapped fonts installed i need too
[00:16:10] <knotMez> which is a trick in itself to pull off
[00:16:47] <somiaj> Yea, I haven't used them in years, though I find I use so little software to compared to most, xterm, firefox, gvim, evince, and libreoffice are the only software I use that isn't ran in a console in xterm
[00:16:56] <knotMez> like i don't have the whole xfonts package installed
[00:17:27] <knotMez> just so bitmapped fonts have less of a chance of getting picked

[00:18:15] <knotMez> somiaj I think everyone just has a short list of software they mostly use
[00:18:41] <somiaj> I do use a lot of stuff in the command line, but gui software I rarely use
[00:18:48] <knotMez> it's hard to learn how to use software
[00:18:50] <somiaj> outside of a browser, and I wish I could not use them
[00:19:27] <knotMez> well maybe not hard per se but it takes some time and effort to get good at it
[00:19:58] <somiaj> A lot just depends on what one wants to do

[05:15:58] <Hydragyrum> any reasonably easy way to check which files in /etc differ from the defaults shipped with packages?

[05:29:33] <Mr_Queue> You could probably get the lions share of changes with a ls -hartl /etc/
[05:29:45] <Hydragyrum> I know that during an apt update if the config files changed on upstream and so did my local version it tells me

[05:33:59] <Hydragyrum> the problem with time-sorted ls is that I've installed/updated packages with files in /etc all the way up to yesterday

[05:37:52] <Mr_Queue> What I would do then is backup the application configs I needed out of /etc like apache, mysql, shorewall, whatever to someplace safe and just reinstall.
[05:38:46] <Mr_Queue> You don't need most of the stuff in there but sync the whole dam thing somewhere safe and cherry pick out what you realized you forgot. Will be a lot fast. Then get your git repo going on the fresh one.

I apologize for asking this, because, for somebody who uses it often it is probably very obvious: I can't figure out how to generate a Release/Release.gpg for a new distribution codename that I added (hirsute). I ran `reprepro -b /var/www/repository includedeb hirsute *.deb`, which ends up seemingly succeeding, and it does track the versions
[05:41:38] <kevr> of the packages in a database related to hirsute

[14:22:49] <tesseract> i will install and use it on the same computer

[14:23:59] <tjcarter> nothing particularly special about it AFAIK‚Äîunless it has some dependencies on RPF utilities somewhere
[14:25:19] <tesseract> why isn't pihole in repo?
[14:25:47] <tjcarter> either because it does, or because nobody packaged it.
[14:27:45] <tesseract> tjcarter: what do you mean by "it does"?
[14:29:43] <Khepra> "[...] it has some dependencies on RPF utilities somewhere"
[14:30:00] <tesseract> i see
[14:32:46] <tjcarter> It's likely just that nobody's bothered to package it.
[14:33:27] <Khepra> I'd stay clear, far away from packages that as #1 installation method recommend curl|bash; not even  sudo bash but you go ahead and curl it as root to begin with.
[14:33:34] <tjcarter> pihole is a Big Project and being packaged in Debian would mean taking on a pretty high volume of bug reports and the like. Even if most of them get forwarded upstream, it's kind of a committment to package something like that.
[14:33:58] <Khepra> It shows how security minded the developers are, and is indication of the security practices elsewhere in the code.

[16:16:54] <tjcarter> If that's how he wants to run it, he can have "leenode" to himself.
[16:18:26] <tjcarter> But I don't really do the whole "cancel culture" thing. Everybody seems to wind up targeted sooner or later, and that creates an atmosphere of fear, rage, and hostility. This stuff should be about merit, respect, and cooperation. I'm not fool enough to think personalities don't clash (mine has with others often enough), but the ideal is one to strive for.

[16:21:09] <ZMarkC> I think it is based on my journal output
[16:21:13] <ZMarkC> its DHCP thats slow

[16:21:23] <tjcarter> ZMarkC: is it one you need for the system to boot/is available at boot, and are you willing to deal with it by hand if it isn't available?
[16:21:24] <ZMarkC> I have network.online then mount, then DHCP
[16:21:34] <tjcarter> if so, Khepra's on the right track
[16:21:44] <Khepra> how do you have dhcp _after_ network-online ?
[16:21:53] <ZMarkC> I have no idea
[16:22:07] <Khepra> how's the network set up? ifupdown, NM, networkd, ... ?

[16:23:24] <tjcarter> ZMarkC: it's kind of a differnt way of doing things
[16:23:33] <Khepra> however, network-online.target doesn't actually verify routability. I've had issues with bind9 failing to obtain DNSSEC keys due to that and then going belly up  ;;  for that reason I whipped up a simple ping service that actually verifies routability (a tiny scrit that doesn't exit u ntil ping returns ok), and then I made bind9 dependent on that

[16:36:24] <Khepra> ZMarkC: _even_ with the mountpoint slated after network-online.target ?
[16:36:41] <ZMarkC> I didn't try that yet
[16:36:47] <ZMarkC> It's certainly gonna be the fix

[16:39:59] <ZMarkC> maybe I made it worse with my static ifupdown config

[16:41:35] <ZMarkC> but enp2s0: link is not ready is after network.online target
[16:42:36] <Khepra> problem with log timestamps is that you can't tell when a specific action happened, only when it's logged. that cifs mount could've started much earlier, timeout iin the meanwhile, and then get logged

[19:12:11] <alkisg> It's for personal use, I share it to my school IT teachers, but it works great so far
[19:12:15] <tjcarter> I'd hope to basically have it figure out what supports/requires EFI or CSM and only show the options that make sense on the system it's booted on (unless GRUB can do that trick Hackintosh systems do to fake EFI when you only have CSM? I can't recall what's the preferred loader for that nowadays)
[19:12:17] <alkisg> The windows files come from the windows usb stick, as microsoft makes it
[19:12:29] <alkisg> It supports EFI and BIOS

[19:19:05] <alkisg> That's an UEFI/BIOS choice, not a loader choice
[19:19:24] <tjcarter> It can be a loader choice
[19:19:26] <alkisg> I'm using the last grub that can load 32bit kernels in uefi
[19:19:32] <alkisg> I don't see how
[19:19:37] <alkisg> It will emulate the BIOS/UEFI calls?
[19:19:51] <alkisg> Sure, if you embed a tianocore in grub or elsewhere...
[19:20:01] <tjcarter> a UEFI loader can load CSM
[19:20:02] <alkisg> But that's not about booting anymore, it's a whole emulation layer
[19:20:10] <alkisg> No
[19:20:11] <tjcarter> (if the host system supports CSM at least)
[19:20:18] <alkisg> The uefi firmware itself can decide to fall back to csm mode

[19:26:57] <tjcarter> But EFI GRUB can still chain off to start something CSM-only (it's a firmware function, but it can do it)
[19:27:49] <Khepra> no_gravity: all that's in /proc/net/netstat, with even more cluess,  btw

[19:29:07] <tjcarter> anything at a TCP/IP level (which is reasonably what matters to you I'd guess) can be logged with it.
[19:29:15] <no_gravity> tjcarter: Maybe I can use something more basic? I prefer to not install new debs until necessary.

[19:52:15] <tjcarter> That's what I was wondering about
[19:52:21] <tjcarter> The other part of that is being able to either start e.g. a Debian distribution using EFI or ask the firmware to start it in CSM

[19:52:44] <alkisg> I'm not aware of any recent distros that are uefi-only or csm-only
[19:53:39] <alkisg> But, a certain version of grub is needed to load 32bit kernels under uefi; after last year, that ability was dropped upstream in grub :/
[19:53:45] <tjcarter> There are some older systems where bugs might cause you to want to start certain Linux distributions in CSM mode, even if Windows can run in EFI on them.

[22:53:18] <peepsalot> hello, i'm building a package from source for local install, and the instructions from project developer are to call "dpkg-buildpackage", then "dpkg -i" on the resulting .deb file
[22:54:36] <peepsalot> the dpkg-buildpackage command returns an errorcode because it is unable to sign the .dsc   however it still successfully builds the .deb files for me
[22:55:04] <peepsalot> is the correct way to bypass this error to run "dpkg-buildpackage --no-sign" ?
[22:55:13] *** Quits: GenTooMan (~cyberman@2601:547:437f:e5c6:21f:5bff:fefe:a883) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[22:55:33] <sney> the usual instruction is to use 'dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc' but if you get workable packages, you can just ignore the warning
[22:55:50] <sney> looking at the manpage, --no-sign would be fine too
[22:56:22] <peepsalot> when i do that, its just slightly concerning that the last line is "dpkg-buildpackage: info: full upload; Debian-native package (full source is included)"
[22:56:42] <peepsalot> but i assume it wouldn't actually upload anything if there's no signature?
[22:56:54] <sney> actual uploads are done with a different tool, dput
[22:57:06] <sney> when it says "full upload" it just means the files are prepared for that
[22:57:36] <peepsalot> ok, thanks
[22:57:39] <sney> np
[22:58:39] <Khepra> and it's not like you can upload anything to begin with, without a DD status and credentials and all
[22:59:02] <sney> that too

[23:48:33] <brutex> but i got verification failed on kernel boot
[23:48:45] <somiaj> peepsalot: you can include a -b for binary only package, I use dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b a lot becuse I don't need/want to build the source package
[23:49:13] <somiaj> brutex: are you using secure boot?
[23:49:28] <brutex> somiaj yes
[23:49:31] <brutex> secure boot
[23:49:53] <somiaj> then you need to do extra steps to sign the kernel
[23:50:02] <brutex> somiaj: how
[23:50:10] <somiaj> not sure, I don't use secure boot
[23:50:27] <brutex> somiaj : you mean in kernel configuration
[23:50:32] <somiaj> https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot -- you may also ahve to create your own keys since you aren't using debian's presigned kernels
[23:50:35] <somiaj> no
[23:50:48] <brutex> mm
[23:51:20] <somiaj> I would personally just disable secure boot, as I'm unsure what other things need to be done in the package creation to ensure the kernel gets signed when built into the kernel package
[23:51:27] <somiaj> but I don't have your use case

[23:53:26] <somiaj> but I don't think make bindeb-pkg will sign as part of the process, so you'll have to sign the kernel after you install the package. I think the kernel signing is done in the debian/rules build on the sign package, but here I have no experience
