[05:42:03] <drobilla> I'm trying to not be a jerk here, and it's hard in text, but... this has nothing whatsoever to do with supercomputers, at all
[05:42:11] <Guest9966> ethereum used
[05:42:18] <dimadima> this is a supercomputer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer#/media/File:IBM_Blue_Gene_P_supercomputer.jpg
[05:42:19] <mockturtle> [ Supercomputer - Wikipedia ] - en.wikipedia.org
[05:42:32] <drobilla> It seems to be largely a mobile IDE which is like...... the opposite of a supercomputer?
[05:42:33] <Guest9966> don't worry. it's experimental term
[05:42:53] <drobilla> I can't even afford the power bill of a supercomputer, let alone the computer itself
[05:43:43] <Guest9966> if 100k devices working together then supercomputer i think like other decentralized 'super' computers
[05:44:14] <dimadima> is animationcpu like that?
[05:44:26] <drobilla> After some digging I found out there is indeed a VM in there somewhere, so I guess "CPU" is _kind of_ fair enough in comparison... but it's a VM.  We have a term for that.  "VM"
[05:45:13] <Guest9966> yes, animationcpu can connect to ethereum or make custom software or blockchain
[05:45:39] <Guest9966> not sure is blockchain is good
[05:45:50] <Guest9966> supercomputer for common metaverse computations
[05:45:58] <Guest9966> maybe key is here
[05:46:11] <drobilla> Even 100k typical mobile devices with a "whatever inherently massively latent internet connection you have" doesn't really meet the supercomputer bar
[05:46:34] <Guest9966> CPU because architecture is CPU based with registers and DMA
[05:46:45] <dimadima> i'm not a successful person, but my understanding is that when trying to introduce a new thing, it's best to use conventionally understood terms
[05:46:46] <Guest9966> just another interested experiment
[05:46:58] <drobilla> The top ten list these days is on the order of MILLIONS of cores, in a single centralized location with a ridiculously fast interconnect that isn't even in the same league as high end consumer anything
[05:46:59] <dimadima> so that people can understand it as easily as possible
[05:47:08] <Guest9966> but why ethereum is 'super' computer?
[05:47:28] <dimadima> Guest9966: i don't think it is, i think that' just marketing talk. and they can afford to do that because they're already established
[05:47:31] <drobilla> It's not and you should never listen to cryptocurrency people
[05:47:32] <Guest9966> why not for mobiles? billion devices
[05:47:47] <dimadima> it should also be pointed out that that kind of marketing talk turns many people off of ETH and crypto in general
[05:47:56] <dimadima> it depends whether you want to run that risk
[05:48:20] <drobilla> Absolutely.  "crypto", I'm immediately out.
[05:48:35] <dimadima> as drobilla says, a supercomputer in real technical terms is a computer with tons of cores in physical space together
[05:48:36] <imode> we're still addressing the troll?
[05:48:44] <dimadima> it's not anything that distributes computation
[05:49:02] <dimadima> not reading this as a troll? but i have bad troll-dar
[05:49:42] <Guest9966> i'm not troll, sorry
[05:50:03] <imode> they're either 100% trolling or trying very hard to pass as legitimate. everything that they've posted is wrapped in buzzword soup, and a majority of the things that they've posted as "proof of concepts", like their... web3 crypto wallet, are nothing but fancy shader demos.
[05:50:20] <imode> not entirely uncertain that a majority of their code is from other projects.
[05:51:02] <imode> down to the licensing. I found it funny that you specify "THIS CODE IS PROVIDED BY THE FREEBSD PROJECT", while including copyright notices in the base repo.
[05:51:04] <Guest9966> imode, are you tech guy?
[05:51:25] <cot> I think everyone here is a "tech guy"?
[05:51:42] <imode> I'm Johnny Mnemonic.
[05:52:35] <Guest9966> web3 crypto wallet is demo app
[05:52:41] <Guest9966> like react-example
[05:52:43] <imode> that does nothing related to anything web3.
[05:52:44] <Guest9966> acpu is react
[05:52:45] <imode> at all.
[05:52:47] <drobilla> I don't even see the code anymore
[05:52:48] <imode> oh my god lmao.
[05:52:58] <Guest9966> why you think?
[05:52:59] <drobilla> So I guess simultaneously both code and "nocode" is fine by me!
[05:53:04] <Guest9966> you analyzed the code?
[05:53:14] <Guest9966> are you saw the video demo?
[05:53:22] <imode> yeah I read your code. it's either stolen or generated, or just verbatim GLSL.
[05:53:26] <Guest9966> here is nocode and code
[05:53:27] <imode> it's a bunch of nonsense.
[05:53:40] <Guest9966> yes the pr is poor and supercomputer is bad
[05:53:50] <imode> are you a bot that just generates buzzword soup.
[05:54:00] <Guest9966> but i'm dev and asking the questions
[05:54:03] <Guest9966> not troll
[05:54:43] <drobilla> In terms of what the actual thing is/does, as far as I can tell (which is near-impossible)... mobile IDE is one of the main points I gather?
[05:54:48] <drobilla> This is not a thing anyone actually wants
[05:55:32] <drobilla> It is, perhaps, neat, but why on earth I or anyone else would want to work on a dinky little phone or whatever, restrictive in every way, is beyond me
[05:55:35] <imode> it's not even a mobile IDE. the things that're shown are just shaders.
[05:55:42] <Guest9966> imode you understand code shaders because you're know glsl
[05:55:54] <Guest9966> but you don't know ACPUL
[05:56:08] <Guest9966> here is the code for HTTP

[05:56:41] <cot> Guest9966, ...I think we've seen enough of that code
[05:57:04] <cot> Not to be rude but it's just.. you know, dumb?
[05:57:27] <imode> if that's an HTTP request you've done quite a bit to obfuscate it.
[05:58:05] <Guest9966> its programming language
[05:58:12] <drobilla> Networking code should be about a billion miles away from graphics code anyway, if you ask me
[05:58:13] <imode> I can see that.
[05:58:41] <Guest9966> its looks obfucsates for you because you don't know how it works
[05:58:46] <cot> Guest9966, how old are you?
[05:58:52] <imode> I can infer, it's sequential execution.
[05:59:44] <Guest9966> drobilla because you don't know architecture too
[05:59:52] <drobilla> Guest9966: ... why would we?

[06:02:07] <imode> so.
[06:02:31] <Guest9966> imode you're think right
[06:02:37] <imode> either you have some very impressive mockups you did in aftereffects.
[06:02:50] <imode> or I'm missing how someone's supposed to run this.

[06:03:26] <drobilla> Missions from god, much more entertaining than... I dunno.  Buzzwords
[06:03:52] <imode> now I'm actually curious, what does that repo contain.
[06:04:16] <drobilla> I love me a good totally unhinged programming effort, but it has to be almost completely isolated from the real world to be any fun.  That's kind of the point
[06:04:19] <Guest9966> imode acpu-server is not public
[06:04:42] <imode> then nobody can run your stuff.
[06:05:03] <Guest9966> because its not open 100%

[06:05:34] <imode> and the rest of your code.

[06:15:04] <imode> do it and I'll support you lmao.
[06:15:13] <drobilla> Here's the thing.  Long-time programmers unavoidable develop instincts about such things.  We can take a glance at code and suss out a whole bunch of stuff with pretty good accuracy
[06:15:25] <drobilla> This isn't confusing because I don't understand all the deep details.  It's confusing because it's confused.
[06:15:26] <Guest9966> imode should be amazing :0
[06:15:37] <drobilla> unavoidably*

Am I just like... imagining things? Definitely a situation where I would love to check timestamps on all files on my phone right about now...
[06:16:02] <freshgumbubbles[> drobilla: really the fundamentals are mostly the same in all programming languages, so yeah
[06:16:31] <drobilla> Language wise it offers nothing beyond a bone stock sequential imperative programming language, except it's very weird and confusing to people who know, well, programming languages
[06:17:28] <drobilla> Being understandable to programmers is kind of a big deal as far as qualities of programming languages go

[06:43:17] <Guest9966> here is code and nocode

[06:43:56] <Guest9966> yeah i'm not English speaking
[06:44:05] <cot> kronk: Yes, that is definitely an issue
[06:44:50] <drobilla> On that, I'm curious.  Is whatever Ukranian maps "programmers" to grammatically masculine?
[06:45:05] <cot> Guest9966: Two things wrong there, which have been pointed out previously: first, your definition of "super computer" is wrong, and second, it's a pretty wild claim and hard to believe
[06:46:01] <kronk> I'm guilty of overhyping my projects and I'm familiar with English, I can't imagine what it might be like to do that and translate it to English.
[06:46:10] <Guest9966> old define w/o supercomputer
[06:46:18] <Guest9966> AnimationCPU is mobile development iOS App for make games and apps. Code on your iPad
[06:46:23] <kronk> I see a parser there.
[06:46:56] <kronk> Also, I can't download the app on iOS. TestFlight is also not an app distribution substitute.
[06:47:16] <Guest9966> its not public right now
[06:47:26] <kronk> Curious as to why.
[06:47:33] <Guest9966> a lot of bugs
[06:47:45] <kronk> Buggy software can be made public.
[06:47:49] <drobilla> That sounds... accurate?  What it is, what it's for, what's notable
[06:48:56] <ndwk> This reminds me of V lang.
[06:49:06] <Guest9966> kronk i have a project plan
[06:49:14] <drobilla> Straight up revert of the tagline would be a massive improvement.  grammar nits: "is /a/ mobile ...", "for /making/ games..."
[06:49:17] <cot> V lang wasn't nearly as bad though, ndwk. I mean, at least it compiled stuff.
[06:49:28] <cot> And wasn't full of buzzwords.
[06:49:33] <Guest9966> most bugs is fix and i can go to TestFlight and talk here
[06:50:11] <Guest9966> drobilla thanks
[06:52:25] <Guest9966> V lang probably a scam

[07:00:12] <Guest9966> drobilla "it's a web browser alternative" is p2p or just a browser?
[07:00:26] <drobilla> No offense or anything, but the model seems to be "dump the whole thing in one messy everything commit in 2014, do nothing since, engage hype machine in 2021"

[07:28:44] <Guest9966> a) CPU because ACPUL 1.0 have a floating point registers and DMA in architecture. For programming and education purposes

[23:35:53] <ignaloidas> thought about it, you should definetly be able to remove one of <>, one is enough, you can emulate the other with the right memory setup and instructions
