[09:48:47] <matsaman> well, it's easier since a numpad is a fixed layout
[09:49:08] <matsaman> would definitely be more work to make it adapt to whatever altered layouts you'd want
[09:49:34] <matsaman> but um
[09:49:47] <matsaman> you honestly might use display: table/-cell & friends
[09:50:00] <matsaman> grid would work, too, I suppose, theoretically
[09:50:27] <matsaman> if you wanted to actually represent the relationships meaningfully, you would actually use a real HTML <table>
[09:51:05] <matsaman> because these aren't really philosophical concepts. Numpads are a rigid structure, as are most keyboard layouts
[10:08:13] <friend> I found a really convenient way to apply grid to it: https://codepen.io/cuirPork/pen/MWOgewE?editors=0100
[10:09:17] <friend> So I can setup the keys and just chunk them into a grid as peers and they move where they need to. Before I was nesting rows and columns and it was a mess.
[10:14:44] <matsaman> pretty light $

[21:02:06] <Howdy_McGee> I was hoping to do this without any inner divs but I'm thinking I don't have a choice.
[21:02:23] <Howdy_McGee> Trying to keep the markup simple
[21:02:56] <eXtr3m0> So the purple area shouldn't be there at all?
[21:03:29] <Howdy_McGee> I was trying to use the purple area as a left buffer.
[21:04:02] <Howdy_McGee> Otherwise if it was just 2 divs I wasn't sure how to keep it aligned with the red area on bigger screens.
[21:04:23] *** Quits: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa) (Quit: Bye!)
[21:04:46] <eXtr3m0> So you are looking for: Header row, Content+SidebarRight row, Footer row. And mobile everything in its own row?
[21:04:47] <Howdy_McGee> The last div I do need continuing off the right side of the screen, outside a normal container.
[21:06:13] <Howdy_McGee> The end goal is to have the greenbox always align with the red box and have the black ".bar" class take up the remainder of the screen space, outside a normal container.
[21:13:42] <Howdy_McGee> I think I'm just going to need to right-align an inner div inside the greenbox.
[21:13:52] <eXtr3m0> https://jsfiddle.net/yform3cw/3/ like this?
[21:14:32] <Howdy_McGee> On larger screens, the green div doesn't align with the red box.
[21:20:09] <Howdy_McGee> Yeah I think it's gonna have to be like this unless anyone else has a simpler markup -> https://jsfiddle.net/5rxL4fuo/
[21:22:39] <eXtr3m0> Howdy_McGee: like this: https://jsfiddle.net/yform3cw/4/
[21:23:49] <Howdy_McGee> Close, but then the black doesn't extend out of the container.
[21:24:11] <Howdy_McGee> That's the part that needs to continue on while the left side I'm looking to contain/align with the red area.
[21:24:41] <eXtr3m0> Okay, I get it

[23:35:31] <Andrew> Hi guys.  I've got fcm.andrewyu.org, two problems: the major column clips out of #content, and the footer, which is outside of #content, is put on the second column, rather than after everything
[23:36:06] <Andrew> How do I 'stretch' the hright of #content so that #major-column fits into it, and how do I get the footer down?
[23:36:09] <Andrew> Thank you@
[23:36:13] <Andrew> s/@/!/
[23:38:15] <matsaman> #content { overflow: auto; }
[23:38:33] <Andrew> Oh, thanks!
[23:38:57] <matsaman> or don't 'float' whatever is going to be longest
[23:39:14] <matsaman> you should only have to float the "side" area
[23:39:35] <matsaman> good idea to use overflow: auto; for the container of both sides regardless, though
[23:40:53] <matsaman> footers don't really belong on websites, but you can fix it if you really want
[23:41:18] <Andrew> What do you mean by footers don't belong on websites?
[23:41:23] <eXtr3m0> I never knew that overflow:auto did that. I would have gone for #content::after { content: ''; display: block; clear: both; }
[23:41:29] <matsaman> footers, conceptually, are for paged media like physical pieces of paper
[23:41:39] <Andrew> And yes, I'm having problems with the footer... understood
[23:41:47] <Andrew> It's clipping inside the columns
[23:41:47] <matsaman> eXtr3m0: that approach was heavily over-publicized, yeah
[23:42:08] <Andrew> I heard of the ::after approach, conceptually too ugl

[23:42:33] *** Quits: horseface (~horseface@user/horseface) (Client Quit)
[23:42:46] <eXtr3m0> I agree. I rarly find a place for float nowadays thanks to display:flex
[23:42:50] *** Joins: horseface (~horseface@user/horseface)
[23:43:02] <Andrew> Ah, true.
[23:43:13] <Andrew> Maybe I should use flexboxes instead...
[23:43:18] <matsaman> you could
[23:43:20] <matsaman> although you don't have to
[23:43:52] <matsaman> you don't really want to treat 'body' as your main container
[23:43:59] <matsaman> it's too problematic, including for situations likes this
[23:44:03] <eXtr3m0> Yup. Flexbox is just more flexible and you can cover waaaay more edgecases easier. But in a simple example like your's, float is fine.
[23:46:00] <matsaman> given <wrapper>...<content/><footer/></wrapper>, you could use html, body { height: 100%; } wrapper { min-height: 100%; } content { padding-bottom: 50px; } footer { height: 50px; position: absolute; left: 0; bottom: 0; width: 100%; }
[23:46:07] <matsaman> for one approach
[23:46:20] <matsaman> but you should just scrap it
[23:46:31] <matsaman> people who disrespect copyright do it whether you have a notice or not
[23:46:38] <matsaman> copyright is by default in places that matter
[23:47:02] <matsaman> and again, footers are for paged media; the information you put in a footer can be put in a dedicated 'about' page, 'terms' page, or so on
[23:47:57] <Andrew> matsaman: License, and site navigation?
[23:48:08] <Andrew> For example 'public domain' and links to other sites
[23:48:22] <Andrew> I was just copying all that from GNU, so I used body as the main container, would change
[23:48:30] <matsaman> yup, put a link to your copyright/license/whatever info in your nav
[23:50:42] <Andrew> Oh xD
[23:51:13] <Andrew> How do I make a flexbox wrap only when the viewport is small enough?
[23:52:26] <Andrew> I'm trying to implement the columns with flexbox, and I need it to be responsive

[23:54:16] <matsaman> flex-wrap: wrap; & width, & maybe add another @media selector for the dimensions you're dealing with
[23:55:57] <Andrew> matsaman: If I use flex-wrap: wrap, wouldn't it automatically wrap everything even on large displays?
[23:56:11] <matsaman> depends
[23:56:53] <Andrew> And, I would like to resize them according to content size, so flex-basis: auto...
[23:57:50] <Andrew> @media selectors just don't seem nice enough, but yes, they'd work
[23:58:16] <Andrew> I'm kinda looking for a flat-css (i.e. no selectors) way of flexing that
[23:59:21] <Andrew> The question: How do I use wrap: wrap with basis: auto
[23:59:24] * Andrew looks it up
