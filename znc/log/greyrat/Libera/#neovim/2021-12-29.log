[05:06:15] <whompyjaw[m]> aye.. so running into another problem... when I go to "install" it, it somehow installs the debug version. So I just want to clarify, you run 
[05:06:15] <whompyjaw[m]> `make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` this makes a Release build in `build` 
[05:06:16] <whompyjaw[m]> then you run:
[05:06:16] <whompyjaw[m]> `make CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/opt install` and this should install the Release build into `opt` right? Or do I need to add the build type as well? 
[05:08:16] <whompyjaw[m]> the neovim wiki doesn't mention this so just want to make sure
[05:08:19] <ii14[m]> you shouldn't need to specify it for install
[05:08:49] <whompyjaw[m]> i figured so not sure what is going on lol
[05:09:22] <ii14[m]> run `make distclean` before `make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, just to be sure there is no garbage from previous builds
[05:09:35] <whompyjaw[m]> ya pretty sure I did
[05:09:58] <whompyjaw[m]> im just gonna reclone the repo lol
[05:10:13] <whompyjaw[m]> and i deleted all things nvim in the `opt` folder
[05:10:14] <ii14[m]> well that's weird, where does it take the debug build from then
[05:10:35] <ii14[m]> you sure you're running the nvim version you have in opt directory?
[05:10:42] <whompyjaw[m]> ya, what was werid is when i ran this command after building `./build/bin/nvim --version | grep ^Build` it returns `Release`
[05:10:55] <whompyjaw[m]> so then i ran that install command, and it then returned Debug
[05:11:13] <whompyjaw[m]> (after i called nvim and `:checkhealth` and saw build type was debug)
[05:11:32] <whompyjaw[m]> aye
[05:11:44] <ii14[m]> you're running just `nvim` or `/path/to/opt/nvim`?
[05:12:13] <whompyjaw[m]> `export PATH=/home/user/opt/bin:$PATH`
[05:12:21] <ii14[m]> maybe it's some other version
[05:12:25] <whompyjaw[m]> then i call `nvim`
[05:12:30] <ii14[m]> not the one you just installed
[05:12:48] <whompyjaw[m]> if i call it rn, it returns `/home/user/opt/bin/nvim: No such file or directory`
[05:14:09] <whompyjaw[m]> i can't install it in root, so there isn't anything in my user dir with nvim. and when i `rg nvim` nothing returns

[13:53:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> It'd be very nice to have natively, but also strikes me as something that could be relatively easily with a decorateion_provider
[13:53:52] <sunjonSenghanBri> a big chunk of the code in all the plugin solutions deal with tracking if you're in search mode, which isn't exposed
[13:54:45] <rj1> i love neovim!
[13:54:54] <sunjonSenghanBri> if it were, a very basic version would be < 10 lines in an on_win() that sets an ephemeral extmark
[13:56:42] <clason[m]> exposing that could be useful for a bunch of things, true
[13:57:28] <clason[m]> but that PR is a 15 line diff (including comments), so strikes me as the path of least resistance ;)
[13:59:23] <daniel_ntk[m]> hi do you know if it is possible to have conditional key mappings depending on the number of diagnostics? I'm thinking of going to th next diagnostic if ther is only one, otherwise show a list of all diagnistics in telescope
[13:59:45] <daniel_ntk[m]> s/ther/there/, s/diagnistics/diagnostics/
[14:00:47] <numToStr[m]> dayum! I tried the PR and it works beautifully ❤️
[14:02:00] <n00bvim0[m]> daniel_ntk: You may make the mappings conditional. E.g. they may do <Nop> if there are no diags.
[14:02:51] <daniel_ntk[m]> could I write a function that is executed for the mapping that gets the list of diagnostic messages from the lsp and then decides what command to execute?

[20:20:58] <YorickPeterse[m]> Anybody have any tips/examples on how to use `vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()` in insert mode (e.g. after completing a function snippet)? I can obviously trigger it manually, but I'm not sure how you'd have that done automatically 
[20:22:37] <mjlbach[m]> No, you would need to map an autocommand that checks, per insert, for the existence of the trigger chars and calls the pop-up
[20:22:45] <mjlbach[m]> There is an oustanding PR that would make this easier-ish

[20:23:47] <YorickPeterse[m]> Ah bummer
[20:23:52] <mjlbach[m]> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16011
[20:24:02] <YorickPeterse[m]> 👀
[20:24:37] <mjlbach[m]> That's super naive though, it doesn't use trigger characters
[20:24:53] <mjlbach[m]> I'm ok with adding a utility that maps the autocommand for that 
[20:25:06] <mjlbach[m]> (I don't have opinions on that specific implementation though)
[20:27:47] <YorickPeterse[m]> Not sure either how you'd best do this without running Lua code on every character you type
[20:27:50] <YorickPeterse[m]> Though you could debounce it
[20:28:16] <YorickPeterse[m]> Ideally the LS could tell you if you're in a function or not, that way you don't do this when it's never going to find anything
[20:28:27] <YorickPeterse[m]> Though I guess you could do that if you throw TreeSitter into the mix
[20:29:19] <mjlbach[m]> Well, that's what trigger characters are supposed to be for
[20:29:59] <mjlbach[m]> checking whether or not the last character was a trigger character is pretty cheap
[20:30:33] <mjlbach[m]> Also, yorick, I think I figured out how to get the unified formatting interface to work

[20:38:55] <YorickPeterse[m]> oh?
[20:39:11] <mjlbach[m]> Yes
[20:39:52] <mjlbach[m]> basically in _vim_exit_handler check all outstanding requests, and allow marking certain requests as "blocking"
[20:40:43] <mjlbach[m]> that would allow `:wq` to appropriately block
[20:40:46] <mjlbach[m]> (for format on save)
