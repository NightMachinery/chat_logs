[12:40:26] <Faux> Absolutely hate the idea that someone would just walk into my house and take stuff.
[12:40:41] <Faux> Not installing barred windows though.
[12:41:17] <T`aZ> indeed
[12:41:41] <T`aZ> never got robbed yet. old the neighbour downstairs did.
[12:42:23] <Faux> Never had anything stolen from the old house, but it was very off the street.
[12:42:44] <Faux> We're quite a bit more exposed in the new place.
[12:42:58] <T`aZ> the police is not doing anything though, and that doesn't help. you got the guy trying to break in, and the police will start making trouble for you instead of this peace of shit east europe stealers
[12:43:34] <T`aZ> so they know thye can try without getting arrested
[12:45:06] <ERROH> i'm trying to avoid capitalism, so stealing things doesn't scare me so much
[12:45:56] <Faux> All of our capitalism stuff is furniture, flooring etc. which is probably less likely to get stolen.
[12:46:05] <Faux> The things which would be inconvenient to steal would be my gpu.
[12:46:09] <MaNI> is belgium the european version of south africa?
[12:46:12] <MaNI> it starts to sound like it
[12:46:19] <ERROH> meeting an attacker in my house would probably kill me with heart attack or stroke
[12:46:45] <ERROH> isn't south africa an african version of belgium?
[12:46:53] <Faux> ouh lah lah
[12:47:26] <MaNI> more accurate I guess
[12:47:50] <ERROH> yeah, whites were first, let's not forget that
[12:54:51] <Renderwww> T`aZ: must be all the EUrocrats robbing us
[12:56:18] <Renderwww> isn't robbery forcing someone to hand stuff over under the threat of violence?
[12:56:30] <Renderwww> oh, it even says so in the image
[12:56:34] <T`aZ> philosoraptor moment right there
[12:56:45] <Faux> Renderwww: I'm interpreting "by force" as including "smashing a window".
[12:57:02] <Faux> In contrast to e.g. shoplifting, or stealing a bike left on the street.
[12:57:17] <Renderwww> sounds wrong
[12:57:23] <T`aZ> there aren't many valuables in my appartment either, but the ghought of having of of the stuff destroyed, including the door etc, is scary
[12:57:29] <T`aZ> thought*
[12:57:31] <Faux> Wikipedia looks like it agrees with you (there has to be assault to a person).
[12:58:03] <Renderwww> I think there is a huge different between getting threatened with violence and stuff disappearing
[12:58:11] <Renderwww> it's both shit but robbery is worse
[12:58:26] <Faux> I dunno, people experience severe psychological shock from having their homes violated.
[12:58:40] <Faux> Wife's flat was robbed while she was asleep in it once.
[12:58:48] <Renderwww> burglered
[12:58:56] <Faux> burglarised
[12:59:08] <Renderwww> if we had gun laws like the burgers have all those problems would vanish!
[12:59:44] <T`aZ> lol
[13:00:27] <dukwon> i once slept through a burglary while staying at my aunt & uncle's house. they had 2 dogs (guide dog brood bitches) but the one that barked at strangers was away for some reason. 
[13:00:36] <dukwon> the burglars fed the cat
[13:00:45] <Renderwww> is hamburglary worse than just stealing things lying around, like nicking a bicycle? law wise

[13:02:00] <dukwon> the cat was a feral one that occupied the garage and used to perch atop the freezer next to the door and try to take chunks out of your ear when you entered

[13:02:10] <Faux> dukwon: :D
[13:02:32] <dukwon> it was called "fluffy"
[13:03:45] <dukwon> it got sick later in life and they managed to take it to a vet, who groomed and shaved all the matted fur. became a lot friendlier/more docile after that
[13:04:22] <Faux> My sister's dog is a complete shithead and the only person on the planet who has the patience for it is this teenager who works at the groomers.
[13:04:39] <Faux> Happy to spread an appointment out over three weeks, pausing when the dog decides it's going to bite you, etc.
[13:05:19] <dukwon> tbh i think i might like to be an animal groomer
[13:05:36] <dukwon> i wish my actual job were just a hobby

[13:07:23] <dukwon> yeah
[13:07:37] <dukwon> elderly labradors only
[13:08:00] <Renderwww> can dogs appreciate the fabulous colors? thought they are more or less colorblind
[13:08:14] <dukwon> dogs are pretty colourblind
[13:08:41] <dukwon> iirc they only have cones for yellow and blue
[13:08:44] <Faux> I think dogs can distinguish most colours, except red/green?
[13:08:55] <Faux> Like, probably can't appreciate colours, but can distinguish them.
[13:09:46] <dukwon> https://ethology.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DogColors5-1.png
[13:10:40] <Renderwww> can we put those color blind glasses on dogs?
[13:11:19] <Faux> How do those things work?
[13:11:27] <Faux> I've only seen videos of people crying with them on.
[13:11:39] <dukwon> they're coated with onion juice
[13:11:42] <Faux> I assume they shift colours (like red in the above image) to nearby colours.
[13:12:26] <Renderwww> magic! I have no clue but they are supposed to work only for certain types of color blindness
[13:12:29] <Faux> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EnChroma#Technology
[13:12:56] <Faux> So it's not even shifting; it's "just" filtering out bits that confuse the brain.
[13:13:08] <dukwon> ~yellow i guess
[13:13:23] <Faux> I want glasses so my brain has less work to do.
[13:13:44] <Renderwww> I want gasses that filter out outdoor ads
[13:13:51] <dukwon> but surely it should be no different to looking at a RGB screen?
[13:14:00] <dukwon> since that only has 3 particular wavelengths
[13:14:08] <dukwon> not a continuous spectrum
[13:14:32] <dukwon> unless the R or G is too close to the problematic wavelength
[13:14:38] <Faux> Suspect the pixels in an rgb screen are intentionally not single wavelength.
[13:14:54] <Faux> Oh, they're not even crazy expensive; like â‚¬300; many people pay more than that for regular glasses or fashion sunglasses here.
[13:15:11] <dukwon> single wavelength pixels is the cheaper option
[13:15:26] <Faux> https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew-Woods-20/publication/228988571/figure/fig3/AS:300722185883654@1448709164541/Color-spectrum-of-an-example-LCD-monitor-LCD04.png
[13:15:43] <Faux> ^ is what I'd expect; LCD monitor.
[13:15:48] <dukwon> ah I was thinking LEDs
[13:16:13] <Faux> Don't think we have any microled monitors at the high end, do we?
[13:16:33] <Faux> I guess we have phone screens.
[13:16:47] <Renderwww> lcd is just some white light from the back with filters

[13:17:14] <Faux> Renderwww: Yeah, but is that my monitors (IPS, TN, etc.)?
[13:17:23] <dukwon> huh, much broader peaks than i would have expected
[13:18:03] <Faux> They're still just blue/uv lights with phosphors, right?
[13:18:08] <Renderwww> if you don't have a micro LED one it probably is how all of them work
[13:18:26] <Faux> I thought making single-colour leds was hard, like, mid/high end laser hard.
[13:18:26] <Renderwww> oh, maybe the oled ones
[13:19:14] <Faux> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode#Discoveries_and_early_devices oh fuck, look at that science experiment, I've got a boner.
[13:20:40] <Faux> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:White_LED.png there's a curve for a phosphor'd blue/uv led, but targeting white, not some other colour.
[13:21:48] <Faux> https://astragroupuk.com/narrow-spectrum-led-lighting/ these people area selling narrow-spectrum lighting and the spectrum is relatively wide.
[13:22:10] *** Quits: sbrothy (~sbrothy@213.83.133.231) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:22:44] <Faux> But it may be practical lighting (i.e. a carefully designed, vaguely efficient led) instead of a very efficient led with 99% baleeted by a mask.
[13:23:23] <dukwon> from my cartoonish understanding of LEDs, the frequency should correspond to the size of the band gap at the junction
[13:23:44] <dukwon> but maybe it's not constant across the junction like in the simplified diagrams
[13:25:00] <dukwon> wow, scintillators also have broad peaks in their emission spectra
[13:25:47] <Faux> > Each photon emitted from an LED is the product of an electron-hole pair recombination. Charge carriers (electrons/holes) in a semiconductor have an energy distribution which is a function of dopant concentration, density of states of the semiconductor and the Fermi distribution. At elevated temperature the Fermi distribution is stretched out and results in a wider range of electron and hole
[13:25:49] <Faux> energies.
[13:25:51] <Faux> SO, 3 upboats.
[13:26:23] <Faux> < CF> Fermi paradox strikes again!!!
[13:38:57] <Carbonflux> heh, that was a really long winded way of saying light is emitted when the electrons change valance.
[13:44:33] <Carbonflux> actually be reading a lot of stuff about electron holes or well as the age of spintronics emerges.
[13:45:25] <Renderwww> I just came across something very carbonfluxian: "I've been thinking lately that I may be reborn as someone else in my next lifetime, and everyone on the planet is actually me?"
[13:45:27] <Carbonflux> gunna be good for batteries.
[13:46:02] <Carbonflux> heh, you give me too much credit Renderwww 
[13:46:57] <Carbonflux> the idea that everyone in a dream is you is both ancient and modern.
[13:46:58] <Renderwww> imagine the horror of not only being reincarnated into some other poor sob along the timeline but being reincarnated into everyone 
[13:47:19] <Carbonflux> a horror God knows all to well.
[13:52:19] <T`aZ> imagine not being reincarnated
[13:53:53] <Carbonflux> you notice how when you get mad at people it makes you unhappy, under the feeling of righteousness? That is because you are not getting mad at them but at a projection of your imagination, a projection produced by your own mind, so in effect getting mad at a compartmentalized version of yourself.
[13:54:47] <Carbonflux> but conversely, realizing you are being reincarnated as everyone at once could be a rational ground for compassion, but normally we just get mad about it.
[13:57:12] <Carbonflux> an endless cycle of self hate based on a pattern of ignorance presenting itself as individual sentience.
[14:05:42] <T`aZ> you should write a book or scrips for a scifi show
[14:07:57] <Renderwww> scripture!
[14:08:23] <Renderwww> maybe Carbonflux is an avid fan fiction writer
[14:08:42] <Renderwww> Harry Potter and the cycle of reincarnation
[14:20:33] <Carbonflux> thats how i think of conspiracy theories, fan fiction of the intelligence community.

[17:11:29] <hinst> If you create a small game just for fun, then it is prolly best to avoid embedding a scripting language; to save time. Providing a sensible API for a scripting language seems not trivial; it is a lot of work Modulo5k

[19:27:26] <Modulo5k> what'd I miss
[19:28:11] <Modulo5k> where do all the programmers hang out to talk
[19:28:37] <Modulo5k> are there hacker / not cracker / not nabisco channels?
[19:28:40] <T`aZ> !topic
[19:28:41] <nolyc> #C++ is strictly for Standard C++, including potential and future standardizations. Stay on topic in #C++. #C++-general is less strict, meant for libraries, projects, compilers, and tools in the wider C++ ecosystem, but still must pertain to C++ in some way.
[19:29:01] <T`aZ> lol, doesn't even mention this chan
[19:29:09] <T`aZ> !fun
[19:29:10] <nolyc> #C++ is a topical channel. There is No Fun Allowed in #C++.
[19:29:23] <T`aZ> !sex
[19:29:24] <nolyc> T`aZ: Error: "sex" is not a valid command.
[19:29:31] <T`aZ> what was the command again ?
[19:30:07] <Modulo5k> So why bother with anything after C++11
[19:30:19] <Modulo5k> hows that for on topic
[19:30:19] <T`aZ> because it's better
[19:30:36] <Modulo5k> yeah, but when do you USE it
[19:30:55] <T`aZ> all the time
[19:31:03] <Modulo5k> maybe 14 but 17 or 20?
[19:31:19] <Modulo5k> I guess GCC11 supports it so.... sigh
[19:31:49] <Crocodillian> Modulo5k: I switched my project to 17, that's new enough to have just about everything you need, and old enough to not cause people problems
[19:32:18] <Crocodillian> Modulo5k: 11 is good enough for most things, and you can often backport some headers from newer versions for your projects
[19:32:40] <Crocodillian> Modulo5k: e.g. I backported the make_unique header from 14 when I was using 11
[19:32:45] <Modulo5k> I needed std::atomic, std::mutex and that's about it
[19:33:02] <Crocodillian> yeah really you can get by with 11 for just about everything
[19:33:12] <T`aZ> ctad is nice
[19:33:20] <T`aZ> std::optional also
[19:33:32] <Crocodillian> yeah I switched to 17 for std::optional
[19:33:36] <Crocodillian> mostly
[19:33:53] <Crocodillian> but you can probably just use the header for that for older versions, I dunno
[19:34:21] <Modulo5k> C++ had to swallow boost and it choked
[19:35:09] <T`aZ> there is a maybe class implementation that I used before C++17 indeed, close to stdoptional
[19:35:12] <Crocodillian> yeah ctad is in 17 too
[19:39:16] <Renderwww> !focus-social
[19:39:17] <nolyc> #C++-social focuses on sex. The channel is unfocused at the moment. Please try again when the channel is focused.
[19:39:21] <Crocodillian> Modulo5k: there's also ##programming and it was amazing 10 years ago, now it's mostly dead like most of libera aka freenode
[19:39:56] <Modulo5k> Crocodillian - thanks for the tip, I'll pop in
[19:40:30] <Renderwww> the c++-social factoid should be changed to "focuses on tunnels and shitposting"
[19:40:37] <Crocodillian> we used to have ##C++-beginners or something, and it was also excellent, but I'm not sure there's anyone there now
[19:41:22] <Modulo5k> there are lots of lurkers and lots of people 'online' at least
[19:42:02] <Crocodillian> yeah there are a bunch of channels with idle people who've been idling there for over a decade with a znc from their vps or whatever
[19:42:22] <Crocodillian> you go into a channel with 800 people and it's completely dead
[19:43:54] <Modulo5k> anybody know any gamedev channels?
[19:44:02] <Crocodillian> ah yeah that channel is actually called #c++-basic
[19:45:04] <Crocodillian> dunno, there's #sdl if you're using that
[19:45:17] <Modulo5k> I'm over at #allegro
[19:45:25] <Modulo5k> I may write an SDL2 driver for my GUI
[19:45:53] <Renderwww> there is, or was, a #gamedev channel
[19:45:57] <Renderwww> or maybe ##gamedev
[19:46:00] <Modulo5k> yeah I see it
[19:46:01] <Renderwww> never went there
[19:55:00] <Modulo5k> whats your favorite *nix flavor
[20:00:23] <Crocodillian> the most intresting linux distributions right now are nixos and guixsd
[20:00:44] <Crocodillian> I haven't tried guixsd yet, but I've been using nixos for a while and it's very nice
[20:02:27] <Crocodillian> one thing with nixos is that it doesn't use FHS, so you'll have to adjust any linux instructions for it
[20:02:33] <Crocodillian> I think guixsd is easier in that sense
[20:05:42] <Modulo5k> Crocodillian: well, never even heard of em
[20:06:23] <Modulo5k> what are they based on
[20:09:46] <Crocodillian> linux kernel, nixos is systemd and guixsd is their own thing called shepherd

[20:41:19] <BigBadWolf> Anyone wanna take a look at my C++11 Gui Library and offer comments?
[20:41:41] <Crocodillian> BigBadWolf: suse is a quality traditional distro, but I suggest tumbleweed not leeap
[20:41:50] <Crocodillian> BigBadWolf: tw is rolling release like arch
[20:42:07] <Crocodillian> BigBadWolf: I have that on my server right now actually
[20:42:09] <BigBadWolf> I only upgrade every few years or so
[20:43:07] <Crocodillian> you can't really do that anymore
[20:43:10] <Crocodillian> everything will break
[20:46:36] <BigBadWolf> Not in a VM
[20:47:26] <Crocodillian> oh are you on windows
[20:47:33] <BigBadWolf> yup
[20:47:46] <Crocodillian> don't even bother with linux then, use powershell
[20:48:13] <BigBadWolf> I like portability
[20:48:18] <BigBadWolf> That's how I test
[20:48:33] <Crocodillian> you can use a linux from wsl to test stuff
[20:48:37] <Crocodillian> with wslg for the gui
[20:49:34] <Crocodillian> would you like to see my powershell guide
[20:49:45] <BigBadWolf> whats that?
[20:49:49] <BigBadWolf> why not
[20:50:06] <Crocodillian> something I've been working on a lot lately: https://github.com/rkitover/windows-dev-guide
[20:50:23] <Crocodillian> I even got banned from the powershell discord for not calling someone's mother a hamster
[20:51:31] <Crocodillian> yeah and if you're testing gui stuff, wslg is actually accelerated unlike anything you'll get in a vm
[20:53:09] <Renderwww> opensus tumbleweed 
[20:53:29] <Crocodillian> I think there's an opensuse for wsl too
[20:53:33] <Crocodillian> I used it a while ago
[20:53:38] <Crocodillian> and you can switch it to tw
[20:54:04] <Crocodillian> but probably best to use ubuntu in wsl, it's the most supported with the least problems
[20:54:09] <Renderwww> I have tumbleweed on a laptop, the only bad thing I can say about it is that it comes with a gazillion packages installed and updates are gigantic
[20:54:27] <Renderwww> ewwwwwsl
[20:54:33] <Crocodillian> yeah they are not exactly doing rebuild deps very sanely
[20:54:52] <Crocodillian> so one pkg upgrade triggers like 100 pkg upgrades
[20:55:41] <Crocodillian> SUSE is a quality organization
[20:55:48] <Crocodillian> I've done some work related to this stuff
[20:55:59] <Crocodillian> they have a system called OBS which is like a github for their packages
[20:56:15] <Crocodillian> so if I want to fix something in a package, I can make a sort of pull request
[20:56:47] <Crocodillian> I can also host my own packages on OBS and it will auto-build them and let people install them as an extra repo
[20:58:53] <Crocodillian> BigBadWolf: but yeah, if you want to install suse in hyperv to play with, nothing wrong with that
[20:59:35] <Crocodillian> BigBadWolf: make sure to add this to the kernel command line parameters: video=hyperv_fb:1920x1080
[20:59:48] <Crocodillian> or whatever resolution you want
[21:00:02] <BigBadWolf> I've had the most pleasure from opensuse. Ubuntu doesn't interest me until they come out with this years version
[21:00:16] <BigBadWolf> Not impressed with 20.04
[21:00:32] <BigBadWolf> I'm dabbling with Cali and FreeBSD
[21:00:56] <Crocodillian> freebsd 14 is very nice
[21:01:03] <Crocodillian> has pretty much full hardware support now
