[01:28:48] <quanticle> Yeah, I also just realized that the entire point making these things NFTs is to make them highly resistant to specifically that attack
[01:29:33] <gwern> ironically, yes. just as scarcity is about to end, NFTs invent a way to manufacture it. but that's fine, as long as people can opt into scarcity as it's useful

[01:30:06] <shawwwn> I think l4rz's catgirl simulator has lots of NFT potential, because people can see their own face in it

[02:31:43] <pompolic> i suppose the most likely examples i could think of would be from infosec. you have one type of attack, and the best-practice defense against it, on some level of abstraction
[02:31:52] <gwern> '"responseText": "{\"errorMessages\":[],\"errors\":{\"customfield_11401\":\"Affected URL can't exceed 255 characters\"}}",' ahahahaha
[02:31:52] <feepbot> TNG edit 20 - Goodnight, sweet BEEP - YouTube
[02:33:07] <pompolic> suppose you have a filter that checks for a certain string and removes it. but alas, your strings are composed from smaller building blocks, and there are alternate ways to encode the string
[02:33:32] <pompolic> abandoning the conventional encoding, and going down a level of abstraction would increase your degrees of freedom there
[02:33:52] <shawwwn> flaunting danger is still the best though https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rYMykaNW6s&list=PLKA_WqdzIF5XlKBO60F4YBW20qElfoQ6y&index=21&ab_channel=byroTube
[02:33:53] <pompolic> ...i'm not sure if this will build up to "this is an antimeme"
[02:34:04] <feepbot> TNG edit 24 - Flauting danger - YouTube
[02:35:59] <gwern> what makes this error particularly stupid is that no arxiv search query URL is as short as 255 characters!
[02:36:16] <pompolic> but now the defender doesn't just have to deal with canonical string, but all the ways you can compose the string from said smaller blocks
[02:36:24] <pompolic> thus the dimensionality of their problem domain has increased
[02:37:21] <pompolic> for a specific toy example: imagine everyone sends messages in allcaps for some reason, but the system permits the full ASCII set
[02:37:30] <pompolic> and you want to filter out the string "LMAO"
[02:38:01] <pompolic> by noticing you have an alternate semantically equivalent way of encoding that, "lmao", you can smuggle the string past the filter

[02:38:08] *** Joins: [_] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[02:38:12] <pompolic> moreover, you can also send "LmAo" "LMAo", and so on
[02:38:35] <pompolic> so it's not as simple as adding more strings to the blacklist, if you want to do it right
[02:38:44] <pompolic> but you have to add a notion of case insensitivity to the filter
[02:38:52] <pompolic> is this an antimeme? i have no idea
[02:39:09] <pompolic> but i think it does increase the dimensions of the problem domain for the defender
[02:39:16] <gwern> it's a meme with some useful mechanisms for propagation defending it against enemies

[02:41:57] <pompolic> the act of dropping down a level of abstraction (probably related to Unseeing) only to assemble something at a higher level abstraction again might be an antimeme
[02:42:07] <feepbot> TNG edit 31   Worf's Anniversary - YouTube
[02:42:41] <gwern> I think this is just a bad use of 'antimeme'. this isn't the opposite of a meme. it's just a meme with some unusual defenses/tricks
[02:43:02] <gwern> sam's definition of antimeme is a very natural one: if a meme is about spreading, then an antimeme is about unspreading
[02:43:23] <pompolic> #1 and #3 are more about unspreading
[02:43:27] <gwern> 'you can get our racist memes through spam filters by writing in cyrillic characters' is just a meme
[02:43:45] <gwern> it's no more 'antimemetic' than memes like 'kill the unbelievers' or 'it is a sin to edit the holy book'
[02:44:00] * Obormot\Arcturus is currently catching up on spider SCPs
[02:44:02] <pompolic> yeah
[02:44:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's some new ones since I last looked!
[02:44:25] <pompolic> i tried to come up with an example of increasing problem space dimensionality
[02:44:39] <gwern> this is more of a 'stealth meme' or 'polymorphic meme'
[02:44:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> None of the new ones I've read so far are as good as the colony of communist revolutionary spiders
[02:44:49] <gwern> cryptomeme
[02:44:54] <gwern> esomeme
[02:45:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that's a high bar
[02:45:05] <pompolic> the filter evasion definitely doesn't match #1, and #3 is ehh also, but damn if it isn't hard to get people to understand you can just pop levels of abstractions
[02:45:27] <pompolic> i think #1 might be doing most of the work in lsusr's definition
[02:45:36] <pompolic> "Learning it threatens the egos and identities of adherants to the mainstream of a culture"
[02:45:50] <gwern> if you decrypt an esomeme to an exomeme, it's usually a lot easier to understand but less interesting
[02:46:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> A lot of people seem to be like "I'm gonna write an SCP about spiders. It'll be like, these spiders are scary and eat you"
[02:46:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that's boring
[02:46:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are already spiders that are scary and could eat you if they wanted...

[02:47:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> And of course the spider communists was tops
[02:47:37] <pompolic> so what i call (probably picked up from LW diaspora) outside view vs. inside view
