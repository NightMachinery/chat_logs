[01:19:12] <Skaface> when you compile xscreensaver, it creates a header file for each image that is in an images directory

[03:13:33] <Codaraxis_> Ah. So, you'd rather explicitly set new access rights/groupings explicitly than risk restoring them as they were and granting something other than they should have

[03:13:42] <ayecee> Codaraxis_: by far, yes.
[03:13:48] <ayecee> Codaraxis_: just like a new employee
[03:14:06] <Dagmar> Generally that's the _sane_ thing to do.  1. De-activate the account.  2. Tar up their homedir.  3.  Delete their homedir.  4. Tar a copy of any files outside of /home they may own and shove that list in an admin's face for possible deletion
[03:14:18] <phogg> We had someone re-hired recently who had not worked at the job for ~2 years and came back in to a different role. His account was still there, so they just reset the password... and he was immediately locked out of it for being years overdue on mandatory security training.

[04:56:05] <craigevil> Kernel: 5.15.4-v8+ aarch64 bits: 64 compiler: N/A Desktop: MATE 1.24.1 info: mate-panel, plank wm: marco 1.24.1 vt: 7 dm: LightDM 1.26.0 Distro: Raspberry Pi OS base: Debian GNU/Linux bookworm/sid
[04:56:26] <bruda> I tried the Debian based one. Raspberry Pi OS or whatever it was called. Was sufficient for general use and building a server with a desktop frontend to manage the system.
[04:56:45] <boingolov> yeah, the issue is they don't do 64 bit yet, last I checked
[04:57:02] <Dagmar> It's not much of an issue
[04:57:06] <boingolov> my pi 4 has 8gb of ram, so if I wanted to do the official release I'd have to do pae
[04:57:10] <boingolov> and why do pae
[04:57:23] <boingolov> Dagmar: it's 2021.  why run 32 bit?
[04:57:29] <craigevil> the arm64 rpios runs just fine
[04:57:48] <Dagmar> boingolov: Why run 64-bit?
[04:58:09] <Dagmar> It'
[04:58:21] <bruda> I have an original Aspire One that's 32bit. Still makes for a decent local server for voice chat, basic web serving, etc.
[04:58:27] <Dagmar> It's a _Pi_.  If you want to run a database with 6Gb tables, you should really be using something else.
[04:59:19] <boingolov> looks like they do have an official arm64 build of the raspberry pi os now
[04:59:29] <boingolov> that wasn't true when I started going down the rabbit hole

[05:00:50] <bruda> Yea Ikey built Budgie. I miss that dude sometimes. Great coder.
[05:00:58] <boingolov> oh, raspberry pi os 64 bit looks like it's still beta

[05:01:11] <Dagmar> Those are generally kind of unstable.

[05:08:26] <auctus> eMMC wont die as easily as an SD card
[05:08:31] <Dagmar> So... at the moment I'm working up an "A/B" system so the ones we ship out in the future will take advantage of the fact that 16-32Gb is really _lots_ more storage than they need

[05:39:06] <bruda> I did hear it was getting to be pretty fast.
[05:39:14] <Khaytsus> Dagmar: Question is, will you download that mp3 over HughesNet faster than Starlink will deliver the system to you
[05:39:19] <Dagmar> boingolov: Well, mainly I'm looking to get out from under the imbecilic 1.2Tb cap
[05:39:29] <Dagmar> I _expect_ the support to be garbage.
[05:39:49] <boingolov> Dagmar: lol.  they usually offer an uncapped home service, you just have to pay extra

[05:41:49] <Dagmar> Not, strictly speaking, illegal things, becuase I'm careful about contracts, but occasionally emails get sent through automated systems before people can stop them
[05:41:54] <boingolov> I can see it in the gateway logs
[05:42:16] <boingolov> they're doing iptables connection tracking and I suspect that's what informs their usage reports
[05:42:21] <Dagmar> in SF we had an ISP that gave us 10 addresses, _and_ routed whois and abuse@ emails to us
[05:42:27] <Dagmar> That saved so many headaches
[05:42:36] <boingolov> probably a lot more scalable to have the gateways do the connection tracking than to pull that information from their routers

[05:47:13] <Dagmar> Because Company A will contract Company B to send them leads, and Company B _swears_ they're not breaking any rules, so if you report to Company A you'd like to not get spammed, they'll ignore you
[05:47:23] <bindi> is it worthwhile trying to make a script for this, or just hard link by hand? I have two directories: /bigboi/media/tvshows and /bigboi/media/downloads/tvshows.

[05:54:36] <cousin_luigi> So, I've updated an old laptop with a recent (openSUSE Leap 15.3) distro and now a few programs are segfaulting. I traced the problem to either X11 or more likely the radeon driver: what would you start disabling in xorg?

[05:56:20] <[[R]]> what did you update

[11:20:46] <Disposeable-Nick> tirnanog, I'm curious about IRC output of various shell applications, as the exec is very limited with regards to IRC, it is TCL exec, and advice I've gotten about making more complex commands work properly, are these examples: you want to use list literal quoting using braces | Not double quote strings | use list literal around all the shell args | {'s/jdjajjdn//%'} etc... | https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Dodekalogue | <<< Basically gives

[11:47:25] <tirnanog> you can use printf instead of $'' if it needs to work in sh(1).
[11:48:46] <tirnanog> although, if you get to the point of needing to care about posix conformance, you really have to work with octal instead. not that's a major issue. the ascii(7) man page helps.

[12:17:48] <exfalso> Hi, I'm building a kernel with a custom burnt-in initramfs using CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE. The build runs in a sandbox and always starts from scratch, which takes a while. I was wondering, is there a way to produce a "half-linked" kernel, and link in the initramfs cpio using some objcopy/ld magic? I understand I'd need to replicate the vmlinux link and the bzImage compression steps? Any guide on how to do
[12:17:54] <exfalso> this?

[12:22:19] <exfalso> PaulFertser: This is needed for a confidential compute VM (AMD SEV-SNP), where we need to measure the full VM image. The most secure way of doing this is to link together the kernel+initramfs+cmdline (measuring them separately causes issues as the hypervisor qemu does some modification to the blobs as it passes them to the guest)

[18:11:34] <selckin> how much typing you have to do
[18:11:43] <phogg> arash: some commands support only one or the other, some support both
[18:12:11] <n4dir> in some cases it is more easy, to some, to remember the long version.
[18:12:23] *** Joins: gmzamz1 (~gmzamz@user/gmzamz)
[18:12:30] <arash> so in this one -A is just a shortcut?
[18:12:36] <phogg> arash: GNU usually follows the pattern --long-opt ARG or --long-opt=ARG (allowing either), but not always. Short options are almost never going to allow an = and *usually* require a space, but not always. It's up to each program to decide.
[18:13:06] <arash> ok. thank you
[18:13:27] *** Joins: cozmo (~user@c-73-235-114-131.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[18:13:36] <phogg> arash: Historically short one-character options were the only thing that existed. The long form came later. GNU style is to use two - and then words, like --after-context. Some others kept a single - and then words (e.g. openssl is like this). There is a lot of variation.
[18:14:20] <phogg> arash: there was even disagreement about what switches of the one-char form should look like -f is "minus f", so turn the f flag off. Therefore, +f is logically "turn the f flag on". Right? Some tools work that way, e.g. xset
[18:15:01] <phogg> consistency would be nice, but you can't force people to be consistent (and changing existing tools breaks expectations)

[19:06:31] <n4dir> sounds a bit like a mess though, i don't do enough for having to handle such problems
[19:06:31] <HiccupJul> that's true, i could use virtual desktops
[19:06:39] <cousteau> rcf: sounds good.  But I was actually thinking on a less destructive option than an oom killer
[19:06:40] <HiccupJul> but it seems a bit like overkill
[19:06:53] <cousteau> Or is earlyoom not an oom killer?
[19:06:56] <n4dir> HiccupJul: yeah, i know it was not the perfect idea.
[19:07:07] <HiccupJul> i know you can rename windows with xdotool, but that's not persistent if the windows changes its own title, also no gui for that
[19:07:19] <cousteau> rascul: let me check
[19:07:21] <HiccupJul> plus still, window titles would be too long to show on my taskbar...
[19:07:28] <punchbag> HiccupJul: Or maybe have more monitors
[19:07:37] <HiccupJul> yeah that's the ultimate solution
[19:07:47] <HiccupJul> but i'm looking for a software/free solution ;)
[19:07:57] <HiccupJul> i could try a vertical taskbar
[19:08:08] <punchbag> HiccupJul: There's only so much real estate one screen can give XD
[19:08:14] <HiccupJul> yeah
[19:08:28] <HiccupJul> although this seems like an obvious flaw of the standard taskbar
[19:08:39] <HiccupJul> at least on small 4:3 screens
[19:08:51] <n4dir> you probably did already check all plugins for the panel you use? I heard kde and such also have widgets.
[19:08:55] <rcf> ayecee: you'll get that eventually, but doing it in userspace means it 1) actually works reliably and 2) is configurable as to what is actually killed.
[19:08:56] <ayecee> cousteau: i don't think fiddling with swappiness will do much to help here, unless you set it to some low value in the past.
[19:08:57] <n4dir> there should be a solution, i guess
[19:09:07] <cousteau> HiccupJul: you could enable the feature to group windows of the same program into a single button
[19:09:28] <cousteau> Or use multiple lines on the task bar, I think KDE at least allows that
[19:09:29] <HiccupJul> n4dir: there is a plugin to have a drop-down list of all windows, in the taskbar
[19:09:33] <ayecee> rcf: oom killer is configurable too. every process has a score adjustment you can frob.
[19:09:43] <HiccupJul> but yeah, multiple lines would be nice if possible in cinnamon
[19:09:53] <HiccupJul> grouping seemed too slow for me - too many clicks
[19:09:59] <cousteau> Or reduce the font size / screen dpi to make everything smaller and fit better
[19:09:59] <punchbag> HiccupJul: I mean, are you grouping the windows by program, e.g. all terminal instances opened under the same icon on the panel?
[19:10:15] <HiccupJul> i'll post a screenshot
[19:10:44] <ayecee> rcf: android, for instance, uses this extensively. programs that don't have focus have much higher scores, and that's what triggers their eventual eviction in the background.
[19:10:53] <punchbag> yeah , what cousteau said
[19:10:56] <cousteau> Virtual desktops are an awesome tool I use often.  Well not too often, I just have 2, do everything in the first and move to the second when I need space
[19:10:57] <lastshell> does oom still need to tweak /proc or there is a tool now for that ?

[19:13:31] <ayecee> cousteau: default is 60, and it's a pretty good value
[19:13:45] <HiccupJul> at the moment, its hard to quickly get to the window i want, because all the titles are shortened (or generic)

[19:19:43] <cousteau> ... Maybe I should just buy more ram
[19:19:53] <HiccupJul> SSDs can "take" less writes than a HDD

[19:22:10] <HiccupJul> although i'm not sure if desktopfolder acts as a "window list". seems more like customisable desktop icons.
[19:22:32] <rcf> One of the fun things about swap is that -- when relying on the kernel to deal with OOM -- systems recover much more quickly without swap, because there is no choice but to just kill something.

[23:27:10] <jim> is there any way to form the data structure of those dependencies? if so, then you can probably make a graphviz of it

[23:35:34] <jim> -generally- speaking, you either have to have what's needed to mount / -in- the kernel, or you would build an initrd with those modules, and it needs support for ramdisk device and its filesystem in the kernel, in order to support that
[23:35:48] <msiism> DPA: No idea. But you could see if it appears in the output of `lsmod` and, if so, unload it, I guess.
