Would it be a bad way of building my deployment strategy? I feel like it would be beneficial to have an image that contains all of my build tools that, instead of making use of com CI-service's different strategies for different areas of my application.

[17:18:32] <queeq> Hi. If a user ID in the container is the same as a user ID in the enclosing system, then files in a volume accessible by the container user would also be accessible by the outside user: docker sets o=x permissions on the /var/lib/docker/volumes/<volume_name> folders, and then deeper in the tree owner ID is the same. Is there an easy way to prevent this?
[17:19:53] <artok> having own docker daemon running somewhere and using tls certs to connect to it, have just docker cli installed on CI thingie, it connects to that "remote" docker server and you don't need to do bind mount for the socket...
[17:22:03] <gordonjcp> queeq: make it run as a different user

[17:23:31] <queeq> gordonjcp: you mean --user option?

[17:25:09] <Lutin> gordonjcp :D
[17:26:19] <artok> it usually involves you to slightly modify some ready-made docker images.. some docker images are intelligent enough to do correct root->desired uid de-escalation, you set environment variable UID and entrypoint reads it after sanity checks and makes sure that service can be run with that UID
[17:28:04] <queeq> artok, so system users created by, say, install scripts should be "renumbered" into the desired range?
[17:29:49] <tabakhase> queeq thats valid, but also a "shouldnt be a problem" thing a little... multi-user-linux is pretty dead
[17:30:04] <tabakhase> so "having this problem" is a little off..

[17:36:42] <tabakhase> (and if those users have docker access, they arte all root anyhow)
[17:37:00] <queeq> tabakhase, maybe you're partly right, but it is not the reason to increase attack surface. Also if something is able to escape the container then it could get access to files the same user ID from other containers has access to, which is easy to prevent if there's separation.

[22:14:20] <tabakhase> GET /v2/_catalog && GET /v2/<name>/tags/list + pagination
[22:15:38] <qilx> yes, that will give you list of all tags for image, but without information about digest, so you would need to then do separate api request for each tag to get digest, which could be bit much

[23:55:58] <jrgilman> Hey there, I'm having issues with docker/docker-compose resolving DNS, I've been trying to debug this sinec the morning but it's fighting with wireguard in some way that has never happened before
[23:56:52] <jrgilman> When I turn off wireguard, or use my phone as a hotspot + wireguard is on it works
[23:57:07] <jrgilman> so something has happened between the way docker, wireguard and my host network interact
[23:58:02] <Lutin> artok are you willing to test this ?
[23:58:08] <Lutin> I'm investigating some problem with the restart of a freeipa server after installation, we have an issue with --dns= read-only and --net The container fails then. Is anyone able to test such a container ? https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa-container 
[23:58:27] <Lutin> artok it would tell us more about --dns and --net (and read-only)
