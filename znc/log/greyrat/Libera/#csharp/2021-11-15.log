[01:14:44] <MatthiasVance> Nah no need
[01:14:44] <Diablo-D3> 27" implies 1440p
[01:14:48] <Diablo-D3> 1440p is a cursed res

[01:15:34] <Diablo-D3> inches isn't even relevant unless you're depending on a specific distance to eyeballs for angular scaling
[01:15:44] <Diablo-D3> as in, 27" 1080p means just push the monitor further away

[01:16:19] <MatthiasVance> Anyway time for zzzz, this was a long day with least 5 modes of transportation
[01:16:20] <Diablo-D3> due to how technology converged, 1080p or multiples thereof are required

[01:16:37] <bomb> 9" front of your face is bad for your eyes, and reputation in public

[01:18:46] <Diablo-D3> bomb: depends, is his dick tiny or not?
[01:18:52] <Diablo-D3> if yes, guilty
[01:18:55] <mechano> case in point^
[01:19:12] <bomb> what if he has a big clit
[01:19:13] <Diablo-D3> bomb: to be absolutely fair though, the entire case is a clustefuck
[01:19:13] <tlf> he clearly has a humungous dick, given his giant boom stick
[01:19:29] <mechano> this is quite disturbing content
[01:19:33] <bomb> Diablo-D3 political, you say
[01:19:35] <Diablo-D3> he did things that were obviously shit stirring and immoral, but we're a system of law not a system of justice
[01:19:37] <tlf> mechano, I would think you're misdirected if you're taking any life advice from an antiquated chat medium
[01:19:50] <mechano> righto
[01:19:51] <Diablo-D3> ergo, he may very well get off on a technicality, even though no woman will ever get off on him.
[01:20:16] <bomb> Diablo-D3 but people he shot had guns as well
[01:20:22] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yeah, thats the issue
[01:20:34] <JakeSays> rittenhouse will get a new trial if found guilty.
[01:20:39] <Diablo-D3> the guy who testified either lied on the stand, or lied to investigators
[01:20:45] <tlf> he'll get off and that city will burn
[01:21:01] <Diablo-D3> I think he was basically blackmailed by whoever is bankrolling rittenhouse's defense
[01:21:19] <Diablo-D3> but that doesnt make rittenhouse automatically guilty, it just means this entire case is fubar.
[01:21:42] <tlf> which is what defense wants, ergo mistrial
[01:21:50] <bomb> aren't they simply agent provocateurs ruined the BLM protests? why left wing is defending those?
[01:21:59] <Nasp> JakeSays: It adds immutability as a language feature
[01:22:00] <Diablo-D3> like, dont get me wrong, I think racism is an outdated mode of tribalism that doesn't work in today's western society, and has been weaponized against the 99%
[01:22:09] <Diablo-D3> bomb: the problem is, they BOTH are.
[01:22:10] <bomb> genuinely curious. I only learned about the trial few days ago
[01:22:15] <Nasp> brianonymous: What od you have backing grafana
[01:22:19] <Nasp> Prometheus / influx or?
[01:22:22] <JakeSays> Nasp: immutability was available as a language feature
[01:22:28] <bomb> Diablo-D3 ah, that's problematic
[01:22:29] <Diablo-D3> they BOTH showed up to shoot somebody, and had firearms, and both pointed guns at each other
[01:22:32] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  I'm also only on one 27" when im at work
[01:22:34] <brianonymous> nasp: i think its prometheus and some custom jobbies

[01:22:54] <Nasp> People still use nagios?
[01:22:55] <JakeSays> Nasp: of course it was
[01:22:56] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yeah, its severely problematic, rittenhouse is a racist who showed up to start shit, but *so were some people that showed up as part of BLM*
[01:23:00] <brianonymous> Nasp: only the legacy
[01:23:11] <bomb> Diablo-D3 our criminal is better than your criminal shitshow going on then
[01:23:15] <Diablo-D3> yup
[01:23:19] <tlf> oh 100%
[01:23:39] <Diablo-D3> bomb: I cant just go "lol liberal bias" and dogpile on the racist here

[01:27:09] <Diablo-D3> bomb: but yeah, the media reporting of the case is a shitshow

[01:29:20] <Diablo-D3> the civil war should have ended this over 100 years ago.
[01:29:38] <Diablo-D3> several generations have been handed down the family racism and butthurt over losing the civil war
[01:29:44] <bomb> oh
[01:29:59] <Diablo-D3> and have acted to destabilize their own communities as some sort of "if I cant have it, then no one can" childishness
[01:30:51] <bomb> Diablo-D3 was confederate vs union separation (under different names obv.) was a thing before 1776?
[01:30:54] <Diablo-D3> and they've acted in unison to hold offices of power to continue their criminal acts against their own people
[01:31:03] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yes, but no
[01:31:10] <bomb> like, were loyalists in American Revolution are today's liberals or something
[01:31:19] <Diablo-D3> the 13 colonies formed the US, and they all had different beliefs

[01:32:08] <Nasp> From the BLM / corona street mess
[01:32:35] <bomb> I'd argue EU started with Crusades, but I got your point
[01:32:38] <Diablo-D3> bomb: but basically, slavery is a specific form of cheap labor; battles over cheap labor vs the rich have always existed, and may always exist
[01:33:18] <Diablo-D3> a truly free state can never stop that fight, the moment you look away, more racists pop out of nowhere and start causing shit

[01:33:43] <Diablo-D3> I mean you "will" but it'll be missing anything objectionable

[01:34:15] <Nasp> REgardless it's stupid to show up at a rally with a gun

[01:34:29] <bomb> wigs?
[01:34:50] <Diablo-D3> the wigs were the british party of the left, and all of our founding fathers were wigs
[01:34:58] <Diablo-D3> after they founded the nation, we basically didnt have parties

[01:35:39] <bomb> hmm
[01:35:41] <Nasp> Is that allowed?
[01:35:50] <Diablo-D3> thats a complex question... because the prosecution is saying he carried it illegally
[01:35:56] <bomb> Virginia mafia, or what were they called
[01:35:57] <Diablo-D3> the defense found a technicality that allowed him to carry it
[01:36:36] <Diablo-D3> kids can borrow guns from adults who legally own guns for the purpose of hunting; it was not a hunting rifle, yet the law does not explicitly state "for hunting"
[01:36:50] <tlf> Nasp, each state defines it differently

[01:37:19] <tlf> oh they can drive younger than that

[01:38:36] <Diablo-D3> 21.
[01:38:39] <JakeSays> bomb: in most places, yes
[01:39:00] <Nasp> I saw this video once of a european who bought a sandwich and a beer and wanted to eat and drink it in a park
[01:39:01] <tlf> there's certain areas where you can drink in public, but they narrow it to a small local in the center of bars
[01:39:07] <Nasp> And got in a lot of trouble, and he was so confused
[01:39:13] <Diablo-D3> so before this escapes, so bomb, the republicans were originally the progressive left, and believed that *all* men should be considered adults and have ownership of themselves, not merely white people
[01:39:45] <bomb> Diablo-D3 that's great. so when they turned into racists?
[01:40:07] <tlf> when it got "carried away"
[01:40:07] <Nasp> I've always felt like someone made a mistake when they made the US laws regarding drinking and driving, shouldn't it rather be drink 16, drive 21
[01:40:13] <bomb> oh shit, i think I know when. since Wilson?
[01:40:21] <Diablo-D3> so they fought a war, the south said "but wait, without slave labor, how can we afford to farm, which you northeners require to survive", but the north said, "but we have industry, and we can afford to pay our guys a living wage in our factories, so you're full of shit"
[01:40:37] <Diablo-D3> bomb: when did they turn into racists? forever.
[01:40:42] <tlf> bomb, because letting african americans be "free" was simply a matter of speech at the time. you were still owning them by red-lining and owning their property
[01:40:47] <Diablo-D3> their great grandparents were racists when they lived in europe
[01:41:00] <Diablo-D3> racism is taught and handed down through the generations
[01:41:04] <Diablo-D3> kids are not just born being racist
[01:41:04] <tlf> but the "purists" became less and less and realized their implied power was being given to the "undersirables":
[01:41:05] <bomb> yeah, fucking Europeans
[01:41:19] <tlf> Diablo-D3, not entirely true
[01:41:32] <tlf> babies were studied to be able to recognize certain differences in each other
[01:41:33] <Nasp> 99% are racists where i live
[01:41:36] <bomb> the word "slave" comes from Slavs
[01:41:39] <Diablo-D3> bomb: well, its worse because the british sold us those slaves before and after 1776; and *black people* sold the *black people* to the british. everyones a fucking shitlord here.
[01:41:51] <Diablo-D3> we won, but sorta still lost.
[01:41:54] <JakeSays> tlf: that's not racism
[01:41:55] <tlf> its the environmental effects that drive that into racism
[01:42:29] <Diablo-D3> bomb: so, the north said "fuck it, everyone should be otherwise equal", and we just killed every fucking racist we got our hands on, and they killed us back just as hard.
[01:42:36] <bomb> Diablo-D3 so what's the rationale behind white racist banning slavery?
[01:42:51] <Diablo-D3> a white racist didnt ban slavery, a white progressive did.
[01:42:58] <JakeSays> bomb: good politics
[01:43:01] <Diablo-D3> whats fucked up is the republicans were taken over by the south.
[01:43:14] <bomb> ah, "we don't need slaves anymore, so why do we keep feeding them? they should just work their asses of for pennies like every worker"?
[01:43:20] <Diablo-D3> post-civil war south took up the republican party as all the next generation progressives became the first democrats
[01:43:29] <Diablo-D3> bomb: kind of yes, kind of no
[01:43:36] <Diablo-D3> they didnt think that at the time
[01:43:49] <Diablo-D3> the next generation of assholes just transitioned to working people to death of *any* color
[01:44:24] <Diablo-D3> they dropped white exceptionalism and just transitioned to classism as their form of slavery
[01:44:35] <Diablo-D3> history is full of transitions in both directions
[01:44:46] <Diablo-D3> when one stick stops working, you dont switch to carrots, you switch to a different stick
[01:44:55] <bomb> it's like slavery wasn't abolishing, instead everyone becomes a slave of corporations, because industry
[01:45:02] <Diablo-D3> qyup
[01:45:05] <Diablo-D3> thats exactly what happened
[01:45:29] <bomb> shit, that makes sense now
[01:45:38] <Diablo-D3> we freed the blacks, but what we got in exchange was everyone became a "negro" in the eyes of the super rich
[01:45:42] <JakeSays> and it all leads to trump
[01:45:58] <Diablo-D3> bomb: so now skip like 50 years and two+ wars
[01:46:11] <bomb> so why are white and black still fighting each other, they're both slaves, they should be fighting their masters: corporations
[01:46:11] <Diablo-D3> we get to the post ww2 era and the export of US labor to foreign countries
[01:46:31] <Diablo-D3> we turned foreign countries into an entirely new generation of cheap slave labor
[01:46:34] <JakeSays> bomb: because the 'masters' keep stirring the shit
[01:46:41] <Diablo-D3> yeah, the "masters" divide and conquer
[01:46:51] <bomb> fair
[01:46:57] <Diablo-D3> black people today still believe entirely racist ideal: "all white people are bad"
[01:47:23] <Diablo-D3> while white people today believe the truth: "all rich people who don't pay their taxes and use loopholes to move their wealth to tax havens are bad"
[01:47:30] <bomb> thus hardworking white folks are obviously confused
[01:47:39] <Diablo-D3> until *everyone* is on the same page, we cannot move forwards
[01:47:54] <Diablo-D3> the current republican strategy is to destroy anyone trying to fix the black communities in the south
[01:47:55] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: i don't believe that.
[01:48:20] <JakeSays> i am of the "we get exactly what we vote for" mentality
[01:48:49] <bomb> fixing black communities, as in influencing them to fight against capitalism instead of just whites?
[01:48:51] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: but some areas are so badly gerrymandered that a minority of white racists overrule the vote of everyone else
[01:49:03] <Diablo-D3> bomb: as in, making sure they get out and vote, and that their vote matters
[01:49:17] <Diablo-D3> look at how hard it was to win georgia, one of the most fucked up states
[01:49:26] <bomb> hmm
[01:49:32] <Diablo-D3> huge black population, all self-deluded with "why vote, we just wont be counted anyways"
[01:49:41] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: and the root cause of said gerrymandering is?
[01:49:44] <Diablo-D3> even though it was 50 years ago their vote truly started to matter
[01:49:53] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: racists afraid of losing their power and wealth
[01:49:57] <JakeSays> no
[01:50:04] <bomb> personally, both parties look same to me from here, because they have more or less the same foreign policies
[01:50:19] <Diablo-D3> bomb: well, thats my problem
[01:50:21] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: the root cause is the voters.
[01:50:24] <Diablo-D3> Im so far left that both parties are the same.
[01:50:27] <JakeSays> we get what we vote for
[01:50:30] <Nasp> It's also strange to think about that 100 years ago women didn't have voting rights
[01:50:34] <Nasp> We really haev a long way to go
[01:50:38] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: yes, but what happens when they vote for one guy, and they're the majority, but the other guy gets elected?
[01:50:38] <JakeSays> Nasp: it is isn't it
[01:50:44] <Nasp> We feel advanced, but we are only fucking ants
[01:50:48] <bomb> Diablo-D3 hehe, understandable
[01:51:23] <Diablo-D3> bomb: younger democrats *are* trying to live up to the party's name, but a lot of the older ones in power need shut the fuck up and resign, they're republican lite to most americans.
[01:51:36] <Diablo-D3> if you do anything but vote to improve the lives of americans, you're a shitbag.
[01:52:01] <bomb> Diablo-D3 it's kind of sad, you could shout out loud "I will nuke entire Asia, but I #BLM" and then you're basically a hero of 'liberals' in the US
[01:52:07] <Diablo-D3> yeah
[01:52:11] <Diablo-D3> and those people are the problem too
[01:52:22] <Diablo-D3> I reject that sort of politics, its just tit for tat bullshit
[01:52:39] <bomb> #metoo
[01:52:46] <bomb> too bad I don't have any voting rights in the US
[01:52:53] <Diablo-D3> I dont care what party you're from, I care about what sort of person you are, and a lot of people are just shitty fucking people who only care about themselves, the whole "I got mine, so fuck you" mentality
[01:53:11] <Diablo-D3> its why theres such a strong socialist streak in millennials and gen z
[01:53:17] <JakeSays> bomb: don't knock #metoo - it's done a lot of good
[01:53:19] <bomb> I feel Trump won simply by being not Clinton
[01:53:26] <Diablo-D3> we saw how much socialist programs in the US helped
[01:53:28] <tlf> Diablo-D3, I have a good living and my sister and mother are degenerates that live on the system
[01:53:34] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yes, but its more complex
[01:53:35] <tlf> but I support my taxes going to the system
[01:53:48] <tlf> because not everyone needing help from the system is a degenerate
[01:53:57] <JakeSays> tlf: exactly
[01:53:58] <Diablo-D3> tlf: well thats the thing.
[01:54:03] <Diablo-D3> republicans strongly reject that
[01:54:11] <Diablo-D3> so I have trouble even identifying them as human
[01:54:30] <bomb> JakeSays oh it did
[01:54:31] <Diablo-D3> they're just some weird "other" that represents unchecked psychopathic bullshit
[01:54:51] <JakeSays> i have a good friend who is staunch republican. it's sad.
[01:55:25] <bomb> why don't you guys have a strong third option?
[01:55:32] <Diablo-D3> bomb: because of republican lites
[01:55:34] <JakeSays> no one wants one
[01:55:44] <tlf> because that takes votes away from the 2 ruling classes
[01:55:45] <Diablo-D3> they will conspire with the republicans to make sure there is no further left party.
[01:55:49] <bomb> it's a little too binary right now
[01:55:49] <tlf> so its immediately dismissed
[01:56:18] <Diablo-D3> like, I support bernie as a presidential candidate, hes the closest I can get to someone that actually represents my politics
[01:56:28] <tlf> we do need a more hex-like voting candidacy in the us
[01:56:29] <Diablo-D3> he's basically forced to be a democrat to even show up on the radar
[01:56:30] <Nasp> I have no idea what ataunch republican is
[01:56:38] <JakeSays> the last strong 3rd option we had was perot, and all he did was manage to put clinton in office
[01:56:41] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: a closet racist.
[01:56:43] <bomb> me too. it's sad he lost to the warmonger Bitch
[01:56:53] <Diablo-D3> and re: clinton, it was a clusterfuck
[01:57:09] <tlf> hey, war was great for me
[01:57:11] <Nasp> Diablo-D3:  So everyone
[01:57:18] <tlf> so much blacking out and hookers, so much
[01:57:26] <JakeSays> Nasp: republican beyond reason
[01:57:26] <Diablo-D3> shes republican lite, she committed crimes against the nation but wiggled out of it, and then the russians "helped" by releasing all the emails off her super secret email server at the worst time for her campaign possible
[01:57:27] <Nasp> I thought it was a political party
[01:57:36] <Diablo-D3> trump won because the russians did a hit on her.
[01:57:51] <bomb> what are good republicans called? cheating republicans?
[01:57:56] <JakeSays> Nasp: it is
[01:57:56] <Diablo-D3> which is bad for trump, because that basically started the whole fucking russian investigation into him and all his buddies
[01:57:59] <Diablo-D3> bomb: basically yeah
[01:58:11] <JakeSays> bomb: RINO
[01:58:16] <Diablo-D3> bomb: if you vote for the good of your constituency instead of loyalty to the party, they do whatever it takes to get rid of you short of murder.
[01:58:31] <Diablo-D3> RINO and DINO are mostly outdated terms, but yeah
[01:58:55] <JakeSays> basically if trump calls you a rino then you're a good republican
[01:59:15] <Nasp> I find it so hard to compare the US political system
[01:59:17] <Diablo-D3> like, ron paul was a rino... devout christian, a practicing doctor, came from a texan voting district....
[01:59:17] <bomb> it's the name of my flirt back in university
[01:59:22] <Diablo-D3> but hes basically republican bernie
[01:59:32] <bomb> republicen bernie lol
[01:59:51] <bomb> oh who was that guy nicknamed Zodiac Killer
[01:59:57] <Nasp> Is Bernie Republican?
[02:00:04] <JakeSays> Nasp: no
[02:00:08] <bomb> no Nasp bernie of the republicans
[02:00:08] <Diablo-D3> even though he refused to perform abortions, he understood his religion shouldnt effect other people as per the exact wording of the first amendment... so he had a doctor he referred patients to for that, instead of just fucking them over like most whackjobs would
[02:00:14] <bomb> like jmer of men kekeke
[02:00:24] <Nasp> ahh good
[02:00:28] <Nasp> Else i just thought i understood nothing
[02:00:42] <bomb> they're all aged 80+ by the way
[02:00:46] <JakeSays> Nasp: lol
[02:00:47] <Diablo-D3> yeah
[02:00:51] <Diablo-D3> ron paul has since retired
[02:00:55] <Diablo-D3> and bernie will fight to the day he dies
[02:00:59] <bomb> I mean, don't they already fought in the Civil War. just retire ffs
[02:01:03] <JakeSays> now we have rand paul
[02:01:11] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Because wasn't he  quite the socialist and therefor should be a democrat
[02:01:23] <Diablo-D3> I feel sorry for ron... the GOP took their revenge on him by turning rand paul into a gop drone
[02:01:35] <JakeSays> Nasp: bernie? yeah bernie would be a socialist if that party existed
[02:01:36] <Diablo-D3> just poured that koolaid into him until he was a koolaid man of hate
[02:01:42] <Diablo-D3> bernie *is* asocialist
[02:01:48] <Diablo-D3> dont insult him by saying hes not
[02:01:53] <JakeSays> he's a democrat
[02:02:01] <Diablo-D3> hes a DINO.
[02:02:01] <bomb> deno
[02:02:07] <bomb> that one XD
[02:02:15] <Nasp> I once again ask for your help
[02:02:17] <Diablo-D3> hes also held office as a socialist
[02:02:41] <bomb> why is Limp Bizkit so hated besides their music, btw. they're pro-Trump o rwhat?
[02:02:41] <JakeSays> few things in this world are more fucked up than american politic
[02:02:43] <JakeSays> s
[02:02:51] <Nasp> I just remember he always mentioned Denmark
[02:02:59] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yes/no; hes a shitty musician, thats primarily why hes hated
[02:03:05] <Nasp> And hate these coffee meetings with danish democrats
[02:03:05] <Diablo-D3> like, why was his music on the radio all during the 90s
[02:03:17] <bomb> Carlsberg is fine
[02:03:17] <Diablo-D3> nobody liked him, it was just garbage shit music
[02:03:29] <tlf> hey hey now
[02:03:30] <JakeSays> lol i've never heard of him
[02:03:30] <Diablo-D3> bomb: recently, hes become more vocal about his politics, but is also an antivaxxer
[02:03:38] <bomb> but he's not the only rapping nu-metalist in the 00s Ducki_
[02:03:41] <bomb> sorry, Diablo-D3
[02:03:43] <tlf> dont be dissin my man fred durst and the chocolate flavored water
[02:03:49] <tlf> hot dog flavored water*
[02:04:00] <bomb> my way or the hi way
[02:04:02] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: he basically was manufactured by his label as a result of a focus group
[02:04:07] <JakeSays> lol
[02:04:12] <tlf> yeah Diablo-D3 so just keep rollin rollin rollin
[02:04:15] <Diablo-D3> a lot of late 90s, early 00 bands were
[02:04:17] <Nasp> Diablo-D3:  Well he might have been a better candidate than those last 4 years :D
[02:04:51] <Diablo-D3> its why a lot of people my age basically exited pop music and went balls deep into lesser tiny bands that would have never made it under a traditional label
[02:04:51] <bomb> change the law and make Obama president again?
[02:05:02] <Diablo-D3> bomb: obama wasnt a good president. he was a mediocre one.
[02:05:06] <bomb> he was everyone's dearest in the US AFAICT
[02:05:11] <Diablo-D3> he looked good purely because of who he followed.
[02:05:20] <Diablo-D3> and he looks even better because of who followed him
[02:05:23] <JakeSays> yeah obama was very middle of the road, which is fine
[02:05:31] <Diablo-D3> but lets face it, biden ended the war, obama didnt.
[02:05:36] <bomb> he destroyed middle east lol
[02:05:44] <JakeSays> bomb: who did?
[02:05:55] <Diablo-D3> no, bush sr did, and clinton left it on the back burner, and bush jr set that on fire again
[02:06:03] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: nooo trump ended the war. just ask him.
[02:06:09] <Diablo-D3> obama's crime was merely not ending the war that he did not start
[02:06:21] <Diablo-D3> biden did it, so he will forever have one positive point I shall remember.
[02:06:42] <bomb> who was the president in 2010?
[02:06:43] <JakeSays> that he did
[02:06:45] <Diablo-D3> I grant biden one fuckup I will not call him on his shit over in exchange
[02:07:08] <JakeSays> bomb: obama/trump
[02:07:23] <Diablo-D3> I think the traditional answer is "I dont know, but Im going to find out"
[02:07:40] <JakeSays> bomb: lol just obama
[02:07:49] <JakeSays> misread ? as 's
[02:07:55] <bomb> XD
[02:08:02] <Diablo-D3> naw, dont you know, trump our first and only president, and is immortal
[02:08:10] <Diablo-D3> his orange paint confers him immortality and good looks
[02:08:28] <Diablo-D3> [ cheetoh in chief grunts approvingly ]
[02:08:39] <JakeSays> i'll say one thing - no one beats a dead horse better than trump
[02:09:09] <tlf> Diablo-D3, our chief supplier of brawndo
[02:09:15] <Nasp> Did i show you this one we had at the office? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/eX218kMk/image.png
[02:09:16] <tlf> no one delivers brawndo like Cheeto
[02:09:26] <Diablo-D3> ï¼£ï¼¨ï¼©ï¼®ï¼¡
[02:10:17] <Diablo-D3> its been 6 years since https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrfE9I8_hs came out
[02:10:58] <Diablo-D3> there is not a day where this isn't fucking hilarious
[02:10:59] <Nasp> It's also been a while since we've seen these https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJuqyb22ecA
[02:11:35] <Diablo-D3> a man who, thanks to his russian benefactors, basically fucked over china/american trade relations.
[02:11:42] <bomb> Diablo-D3 uhh, what's that guy tryina, though?
[02:11:43] <Nasp> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oguvSPdtHQ8 Ahh here it was
[02:12:33] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: jesus christ I forgot these existed
[02:13:04] <Nasp> They are great
[02:14:02] <bomb> FL is one of the southern states. is it safe for a foreigner?
[02:14:06] <Diablo-D3> no
[02:14:11] <Diablo-D3> its not even a "southern" sate
[02:14:13] <Nasp> I wonder if we as human race will keep disagreeing politically forever
[02:14:15] <Diablo-D3> its in its own category of florida.
[02:14:19] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: yes.
[02:14:35] <Diablo-D3> some people promote the health and wellbeing of not only their tribe, but all tribes
[02:14:42] <bomb> Wikipedia says it is
[02:14:44] <Diablo-D3> and some people are content to mongle cock.
[02:14:47] <Nasp> So yes we will never agree
[02:15:10] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: so, lets try this
[02:15:11] <Diablo-D3> I'm white
[02:15:13] <bomb> https://s3.amazonaws.com/multistate.us/shared/hubspot/export/2019%20Legislatures%20by%20Party%20Map%20Only.png
[02:15:18] <bomb> red ones are bad, then
[02:15:20] <Diablo-D3> lets say I believe that white supremacy is a valid ideal
[02:15:36] <Diablo-D3> if white people really are so supreme
[02:15:38] <bomb> only CO and NM don't have sea lol
[02:15:48] <Nasp> Arent' the blue ones bad as well
[02:15:50] <Diablo-D3> should we not be ruling by example?
[02:15:55] <bomb> Colorado and North Minnesota or what
[02:16:08] <bomb> blue good nasp
[02:16:18] <Diablo-D3> red bad, blue bad, purple bad, clearly
[02:16:23] <Nasp> Aren't democrats bad
[02:16:26] <bomb> oh wtf is that purple one
[02:16:32] <Diablo-D3> purple is mixed
[02:16:32] <bomb> are they pro-Canada or something?
[02:16:47] <Diablo-D3> bomb: notice this is a map of state legislature
[02:16:51] <tlf> Im pro canada, they have harry and meaghan
[02:16:57] <bomb> legiswho
[02:16:58] <Diablo-D3> it *sort of* indicates political bent of that state
[02:17:07] <bomb> I just wanted to see who voted Trump who voted Biden
[02:17:17] <Nasp> Are Democrats normally represented with blue, and republicans vice versa?
[02:17:24] <Diablo-D3> demo is blue, gop is red
[02:17:32] <Diablo-D3> bomb: you cant see who voted what here
[02:17:44] <Nasp> That seems quite confusing because here they are represented opposite
[02:17:46] <bomb> not person by person Diablo-D3
[02:17:48] <Diablo-D3> a surprisingly large number of registered democrats basically voted "not hillary"
[02:18:00] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: no it doesnt
[02:18:02] <bomb> can't we see who got the most votes in, say, Nebraska?
[02:18:19] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: this is a map purely of who is the majority in the state senate
[02:18:24] <Nasp> Ahh
[02:18:27] <Diablo-D3> bomb: you can, theres lists of this, even on wikipedia
[02:18:29] <Nasp> I thought it was the color of the parties
[02:18:36] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: its *also* the color of the parties
[02:18:49] <Nasp> Ok, but then it is confusing, because our democrats are red
[02:18:54] <bomb> oh what's WV never heard of it before
[02:18:55] <Diablo-D3> according to this map, most states have a republican-lead state senate, which is interesting because several of those states are blue states
[02:19:00] <bomb> Wisconsin is WI
[02:19:04] <Diablo-D3> bomb: west virginia
[02:19:15] <bomb> ah, founding fathers land
[02:19:33] <Diablo-D3> bomb: part of virginia broke off during the civil war because they identified as northern
[02:19:50] <Diablo-D3> and just stayed that way
[02:20:16] <bomb> hmm
[02:20:19] <Diablo-D3> virigina was the most northern slave labor farming state, but WV was primarily coal and coal-related industries
[02:20:39] <Diablo-D3> they considered themselves both sons of virigina, but would never see eye to eye
[02:21:18] <bomb> is it true that Abraham Lincoln had a boyfriend?
[02:21:30] <Diablo-D3> doubt it
[02:21:32] <Diablo-D3> but also dont care
[02:21:45] <Diablo-D3> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election
[02:21:50] <Diablo-D3> btw, wikipedia is a list of lists.
[02:22:05] <bomb> Powell?
[02:22:11] <bomb> I hope it's not Colin Powell
[02:22:13] <Nasp> Why are your colors all switched around
[02:22:21] <Nasp> Like just look at the picturs those are right on that wiki Diablo-D3
[02:22:34] <Diablo-D3> you mean why are our republicans red?
[02:22:38] <bomb> lol it's actually Colin Powell haha
[02:22:40] <Nasp> Diablo-D3:  yes
[02:22:43] <Diablo-D3> I dont know
[02:22:50] <Diablo-D3> also, why are our right other people's left?
[02:22:57] <bomb> referring to rednecks?
[02:23:01] <Nasp> Hmm isn't that the same
[02:23:09] <Diablo-D3> its weird
[02:23:11] <Nasp> Like left and right have always been opposite right?
[02:23:35] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: maybe? the concept didnt exist until the first political compass
[02:23:36] <bomb> there are greens in Europe
[02:23:43] <Diablo-D3> but its also why theres an up/down too
[02:23:48] <Nasp> Our left winged parties are on the right, and right winges on the left
[02:23:55] <Diablo-D3> like you can be fiscally conservative but not authoritarian
[02:24:01] <Nasp> Due to back in french time due to their position from the king
[02:24:12] <Nasp> Something something like that if i remember anything from school
[02:24:18] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: yeah, its just weird
[02:24:29] <Nasp> And yes it's quite confusing
[02:24:35] <bomb> fiscally conservative? what does that mean
[02:24:35] <Diablo-D3> its easier to just be on an authoritarian/socialism scale
[02:24:41] <Diablo-D3> bomb: dont want to spend money.
[02:24:56] <bomb> I'm communist, but I run own this factory
[02:25:05] <Diablo-D3> republicans claim to be fiscally conservative, but then incur the largest increase in the national debt and pass the biggest national budgets (ie, they lie)
[02:25:14] <bomb> ah, conservative as in convservative
[02:25:16] <Nasp> bomb:  Yeah not sure if you are joking or actually serious
[02:25:31] <bomb> Nasp was just pointing out the oxymoron
[02:25:43] <Diablo-D3> I'm socialist, but am also fiscally conservative
[02:25:56] <Nasp> I'm probably liberal
[02:26:01] <Diablo-D3> money should not be spent unless it is proven to actually be an effective use of the money.
[02:26:07] <bomb> that sounds like a personal thing, rather than a financial structure you support
[02:26:14] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yes and no
[02:26:55] <Diablo-D3> its not uncommon for republicans to be personally fiscally conservative, but want to spend everyone else's money on themselves
[02:27:10] <Diablo-D3> primarily, because they're dicks.
[02:27:14] <bomb> are socialists in the US appreciate Lenin or Marx & Engels, by the way?
[02:27:20] <Diablo-D3> no
[02:27:28] <Diablo-D3> socialists in america are more like nordic ones
[02:27:32] <Diablo-D3> fuck the communists
[02:27:42] <bomb> I mean, they fought Stalin
[02:27:44] <bomb> what's your excuse?
[02:27:51] <bomb> s/excuse/reason/
[02:27:53] <Nasp> Diablo-D3:  We have waaay to many of those
[02:27:57] <Diablo-D3> I do not approve of us allying with Stalin
[02:28:12] <Nasp> don't go the social route unless you want 50%+ taxes
[02:28:12] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: why not?
[02:28:14] <Diablo-D3> so, of that era, you had primarily 3 bad guys.
[02:28:24] <Diablo-D3> stalin, mao, *then* hitler
[02:28:24] <bomb> who are they?
[02:28:41] <Diablo-D3> all three of them killed their own for political gain
[02:28:48] <Diablo-D3> hitler was not the highest.
[02:28:51] <Diablo-D3> yet we shit on him the most
[02:28:57] <Nasp> Diablo-D3:  No Mussolini on that list?
[02:29:04] <JakeSays> hitler wasn't killing his own for political gain.
[02:29:18] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: no, he worked for hitler thus doesnt get his own name on the table
[02:29:21] <bomb> I highly doubt it
[02:29:28] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: yes he was
[02:29:44] <Diablo-D3> he was elected into office for the sole purpose to reclaim the glory of the rhineland. ie, murder jews.
[02:29:48] <JakeSays> no. he killed his own out of hatred.
[02:29:49] <Diablo-D3> read his fucking book.
[02:30:06] <Nasp> Mein kampf?
[02:30:11] <Diablo-D3> its a manual on how to overthrow a modern western government, as written from the perspective of a traitor.
[02:30:13] <bomb> moooods, diablo just told us to read Hitler's book XD
[02:30:21] <Nasp> There's a netflix series about that
[02:30:23] <Diablo-D3> bomb: I think everyone should, tbh
[02:30:24] <Nasp> Can't remember it's name
[02:30:30] <Diablo-D3> you need to know what to look for when you're presented with it
[02:30:47] <Diablo-D3> trump quoted mein kampf openly, yet most people never read it, so never knew it
[02:30:52] <Diablo-D3> they voted for orange micro-hitler.
[02:31:00] <JakeSays> hitler's means may have been political, but his motivation was pure hatred.
[02:31:05] <bomb> arbeit mach frei
[02:31:06] <Nasp> I still find his orange appearance so funny looking
[02:31:13] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: there is very little difference
[02:31:32] <Diablo-D3> republicans kill blacks because of hatred, but do it as a matter of political affiliation.
[02:31:34] <JakeSays> that's not true
[02:31:34] <Nasp> Does he just down a liter of beta caroten a day
[02:31:41] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: no, its spray tan
[02:31:47] <Nasp> Isn't it beta caroten?
[02:31:53] <bomb> WWI fucked up Germany real bad. it's unfortunate Hitler was the guy who fooled the Germans afterwards
[02:32:00] <Diablo-D3> no, pretty sure the shit they use is toxic
[02:32:08] <Diablo-D3> bomb: WW1 was a complete fuckup period
[02:32:26] <Diablo-D3> hitler wanted revenge on who he thought was the cause, but ... just veered off into crazyland
[02:32:32] <Diablo-D3> his own government sent him to die
[02:33:07] <Diablo-D3> I dont get where he thought his government was secretly ran by the jews, thats the weird part
[02:33:16] <Diablo-D3> the royal family that ran germany *also* hated the jews.
[02:33:18] <bomb> England
[02:33:36] <Diablo-D3> fun fact, the royal family of europe is basically related to only itself
[02:33:47] <Nasp> Diablo-D3:  Ofc
[02:33:55] <Diablo-D3> generations of interbreeding with very little new genetic material removed them from being related to any population they ruled over
[02:33:59] <Nasp> That's how it's been for a long time
[02:34:10] <Diablo-D3> ww1 was, basically, a spat between memebers of the royal family
[02:34:23] <Nasp> I still find the Royal family a bit strange from time to time
[02:34:25] <Diablo-D3> the last tzar of russia, overthrown by the october revolution, was also part of that family
[02:34:31] <Diablo-D3> all cockboags.
[02:34:33] <bomb> Brits propaganda machine worked like crazy when they're trying to convince the US to join the war
[02:34:39] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yeah
[02:34:42] <Diablo-D3> and we shouldnt have
[02:34:44] *** Quits: kenanmarasli (~kenanmara@user/kenanmarasli) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:34:47] <Diablo-D3> we had no business in ww1
[02:34:51] <Diablo-D3> we came too late to change the outcome
[02:34:57] <Diablo-D3> and we had the most deaths
[02:35:07] <Diablo-D3> it was such a fuckup that we almost didnt enter ww2
[02:36:01] <Diablo-D3> which means cockbag supreme would have taken over europe, took a bunch of meth, his scientists would have tech rushed the nuke
[02:36:16] <bomb> Nazis making soaps out of death bodies was actually the rumor said for Belgian deads in WW1
[02:37:01] <Diablo-D3> ww1 and ww2 was a fucking mistake
[02:37:48] <bomb> was it?
[02:38:06] <bomb> I mean, it was, for the humanity
[02:38:38] <bomb> but how could Aramco become a thing today if there wasn't WW1
[02:38:58] <Diablo-D3> bomb: well
[02:39:06] <Diablo-D3> germany and britian should have both been bombed into the ground
[02:39:14] <Diablo-D3> by us.
[02:39:18] <Diablo-D3> both. kaboom.
[02:39:21] <bomb> heh
[02:39:26] <Diablo-D3> both were wrong.
[02:39:37] <Diablo-D3> both. were. wrong.
[02:40:00] <bomb> it was an imperialism race
[02:40:16] <Diablo-D3> it was fucking stupid
[02:40:19] <bomb> how the US bombing UK & Germany different?
[02:40:28] <Diablo-D3> we shouldnt have came to the aid of the UK
[02:40:30] <Diablo-D3> it didnt change.
[02:40:40] <Diablo-D3> it was still the shithole it was that we left in 1776
[02:41:04] <Diablo-D3> and germany, you know how many fucking germans came here before and after the founding of our nation because of how shitty germany was?
[02:41:07] <bomb> in return, Brits gave you the Middle East after the war
[02:41:15] <Diablo-D3> naw, the middle east existed because of rome
[02:41:30] <bomb> existed?
[02:41:32] <Diablo-D3> after the fall of rome, a power vacuum existed which the ottoman empire filled
[02:41:36] <bomb> I mean, human civilization started there
[02:41:56] <Diablo-D3> the ottoman empire was having its own adventure during ww1, and thats about when it finally fucking died
[02:41:57] <bomb> I'm saying, US couldn't have Middle East without participating in WW2
[02:42:03] <Diablo-D3> not at all
[02:42:04] <Nasp> Are you saying US shouldn't have entered WW2 at all?
[02:42:17] <Diablo-D3> Im saying we should have entered, but only to protect the innocent
[02:42:21] <Diablo-D3> the UK was not innocent
[02:42:40] <Diablo-D3> the people of germany were, and were being fucked over by their brand new government
[02:42:50] <bomb> Ottoman Empire was being sliced in WW1
[02:42:54] <Diablo-D3> they had the right idea, overthrow their own cockbag, but they installed an even worse cockbag
[02:42:58] <Diablo-D3> bomb: its complex
[02:43:13] <bomb> explain
[02:43:21] <Diablo-D3> the ottoman empire was already starting to disintegrate due to racial tensions and division of political belief
[02:43:26] <Diablo-D3> it was happening at the same time of ww1
[02:43:29] <Nasp> I'm just wondering when we will get the next WW
[02:43:30] <bomb> racial tensions?
[02:43:37] <Diablo-D3>  yes
[02:43:56] <Diablo-D3> white people hate white people, asians hate asians, blacks hate blacks, arabs hate arabs
[02:44:09] <Diablo-D3> there are just as many divisions amongs themselves as theere are of us white people
[02:44:12] <bomb> lol
[02:44:20] <Diablo-D3> its still happening today
[02:44:32] <Diablo-D3> muslims kill muslims because they're the wrong type of muslim
[02:44:38] <Diablo-D3> or the wrong shade of brown
[02:44:41] <bomb> I don't think you're very well versed in history outside of the US
[02:45:10] <Diablo-D3> Im well versed enough to understand about 2000 years of european history
[02:45:27] <Diablo-D3> maybe not enough to do a phd dissertation, but enough to understand the finer points
[02:45:58] <Diablo-D3> ww1 and the end of the ottoman empire influenced each other, but did not cause each other, and would have had the same outcomes if the other didnt exist
[02:46:33] <Diablo-D3> the UK thought they could run a side game and fill that power vacuum of the ottoman empire falling apart, their last great hurrah
[02:46:44] <Diablo-D3> this bled into ww2 as well
[02:46:47] <bomb> I mean, there are many Armenian and Greek ministers and other officials in Ottoman government during WW1
[02:46:53] <bomb> to start with
[02:47:26] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yes, but they were already having issues with people saying they were the real ottoman empire and the other people werent in the period inbetween ww1 and ww2
[02:47:47] <Diablo-D3> eventually they all just became their own governments, approximating pre-ottoman and sometimes pre-roman lines
[02:48:23] <Diablo-D3> it didnt become ultra-clusterfuck plusplus until post-WW2 allied forces sauntered in and invented the modern state of israel.
[02:48:29] <bomb> obviously that was the idea. divide and conquer
[02:48:46] <Diablo-D3> divide and conquer works, look at how rome fell
[02:49:16] <bomb> of course
[02:49:31] <Diablo-D3> they internally divided over what language to do catholic liturgy in, which we now know was driven by external factors
[02:49:51] <Diablo-D3> and then what became the ottoman empire went in and fucked over half of rome.
[02:49:54] <Nasp> Israel will never be fixed until one side have completely annihilated the other
[02:49:54] <bomb> being internally divided is a good thing
[02:50:03] <bomb> it means nations didn't assimilate
[02:50:06] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: its stupid anyways
[02:50:17] <Diablo-D3> either we externally recognize both, or we recognize neither.
[02:50:31] <Nasp> Recognize neither and make them figure it out
[02:50:38] <Diablo-D3> america has no right to interfere except purely protect the innocent.
[02:50:41] <bomb> Israel wouldn't be a thing without WW2 either
[02:51:21] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yes, israel was the end result of basically 100% genetically german jews (who still had a claim of lineage) that left to their "homeland"
[02:51:32] <Diablo-D3> which didnt exist, and had not existed for over 2000 years.
[02:51:41] <Diablo-D3> and had been subsumed into other nations multiple times
[02:52:07] <Diablo-D3> but I guess going to the middle of a godforsaken desert is better than dying in a death camp
[02:55:48] <bomb> I'm just sad Brits got away with all the crap
[02:56:07] <bomb> reality hit Germans hard, but Brits are still the same
[02:56:15] <Diablo-D3> yeah
[02:56:22] <Diablo-D3> and its all because we took sides
[02:56:32] <Diablo-D3> like, I understand hitler, but hes still a cuck either way
[02:56:42] <Diablo-D3> he killed his own just to take out his rage on some random minority
[02:56:53] <bomb> it took a lot of efforts, though
[02:57:05] <Diablo-D3> the minority that fucked him was the 1%.
[02:57:13] <bomb> UK hired dozens of writers to create pro-war material, get them published in the US
[02:57:17] <Diablo-D3> yup
[02:57:23] <Diablo-D3> and then our own president, although not wrong, helped.
[02:57:42] <JakeSays> man you guys still on this shit
[02:57:43] <JakeSays> ?
[02:57:44] <Diablo-D3> FDR basically forced us into WW2
[02:57:57] <Diablo-D3> he wasnt wrong, but jesus christ fuck manufactured consent
[02:58:00] <bomb> Hitler had to be stopped, that's for sure
[02:58:05] <Diablo-D3> yup
[02:58:16] <bomb> yeah. so many lies told to get there
[02:58:18] <Diablo-D3> the moment he started invading other nations just to do that shit
[02:58:25] <JakeSays> hmm. so fdr flew those jap bombers to hawaii?
[02:58:37] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: I dont get why people say shit backwards
[02:58:52] <Diablo-D3> the pacific theatre happened at what would have been the end of ww2
[02:58:54] <bomb> Jake is DINO XD
[02:58:57] <Diablo-D3> and extended it for another ~5 years
[02:59:28] <Diablo-D3> it literally came out of nowhere, nobody expected the head of the japanese military to order an attack on the US without permission of his government
[02:59:45] * gufi just spent the last 2 hours cleaning the transmission case for the car
[02:59:50] <Diablo-D3> and then nobody expected japan to just back him anyways
[03:00:03] <gufi> cant imagine how long that would have taken without the little steam cleaner i bought
[03:00:03] <JakeSays> so the war was coming to an end in 1941?
[03:00:25] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: the war basically came to an end the moment hitler shot himself in a bunker under whats now a mcdonalds parking lot.
[03:00:50] <Diablo-D3> if japan wouldnt have done what they did, the conquering of berlin by US and Russian forces would be the last chapter in that book.
[03:00:53] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: but you said that had japan not hit hawaii the war would've ended
[03:01:00] <Diablo-D3> yup.
[03:01:12] <Diablo-D3> japan basically after the credits scened us for a sequel.
[03:01:22] <Diablo-D3> ww2 part 2
[03:01:40] <JakeSays> huh. i think you're full of shit. the war was far from over in 1941.
[03:02:04] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: hitler killed himself in 1945, btw
[03:02:09] <JakeSays> i am aware
[03:02:15] <Diablo-D3> it wasnt truly over until that.
[03:02:21] <JakeSays> ya think?
[03:03:10] <Diablo-D3> hitler was already unable to win in 1941, japan knew this and knew they could not come to his aid.
[03:03:18] <Diablo-D3> there was nothing they could do except piss us off.
[03:03:51] <Diablo-D3> its backwards to say "japan entered the way before hitler lost"
[03:04:03] <Nasp> Never nuke a country twicw
[03:04:05] <Diablo-D3> no, they entered the war after hitler lost.
[03:04:35] <JakeSays> well, that whole timeline thing, you know, events happening one before the other, kind of says your'e full of shit.
[03:04:38] <bomb> 1941, during Operation Barbarossa yeah
[03:04:52] <Diablo-D3> yeah, operation barbarossa sealed his fate
[03:05:00] <JakeSays> Nasp: never nuke a country once when you can do it twice
[03:06:22] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: except japan bombed hawaii in december of 1941, barbarossa started in june and had already failed before japan's attack
[03:07:02] <Diablo-D3> the japanese military officer that ordered it did so as some sort of misguided bullshit to uphold japan's honor and their ally, germany
[03:07:29] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: dude.. that was a fucking battle. hitler didn't lose until the war ended.
[03:07:44] <Diablo-D3> it took us 4 years to finally conquer berlin after this mistake, but he lost the eastern front because of this push into russia
[03:08:00] <Diablo-D3> if this was a video game, 1941 is where you rage quit.
[03:08:34] <JakeSays> your whole argument about shit being backward is absolutely irrelevant.
[03:09:19] <Diablo-D3> you said japan bombed hawaii in a timeframe that was described as anything but "the end of the european theatre"
[03:09:30] <JakeSays> its like the drivel never stops with this one
[03:09:41] <Diablo-D3> as if Im not thinking the same of you.
[03:10:07] <bomb> Mussolini was a dumbass btw
[03:10:31] <JakeSays> bomb: indeed he was
[03:10:50] <bomb> he couldn't even conquer Greece without Hitler's help
[03:13:58] <JakeSays> i need to print a raspi case
[03:15:54] <bomb> ah JakeSays I wanted to ask you something about rpi
[03:16:24] <bomb> I want to make a dual-monitor setup to watch stock markets
[03:16:41] <bomb> heavy TradingView stuff on Chrome with several indicators and stuff
[03:17:01] <bomb> would RPi 4 model B a good idea?
[03:17:32] <JakeSays> on chrome?
[03:17:45] <bomb> Raspberry Pi OS + Chromium
[03:17:49] <bomb> browser
[03:17:53] <JakeSays> it'd work, but not sure how well
[03:18:04] <JakeSays> well, just get the 8gb one
[03:18:33] <Nasp> bomb:  Ohh that tradingview looks nice
[03:18:34] <bomb> not cheap enough to just to test
[03:18:37] <Nasp> I don't have realtime on my exchange
[03:18:57] <JakeSays> what's tradingview?
[03:19:07] <Nasp> A place with stock graphs
[03:19:13] <Nasp> Hmm does it only have nasdaw or
[03:19:17] <bomb> Nasp aye TV is great. paid version (15 bucks or something) also have server-side alarms and stuff
[03:19:32] <bomb> I only use it for cryptocoin stuff :)
[03:19:38] <Nasp> Alerts i can get, but 15 minutes delayed
[03:19:46] *** Quits: tlf (~tlf@mobile-166-170-21-118.mycingular.net) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[03:19:48] <JakeSays> huh. interesting.
[03:20:02] <JakeSays> i do have live ticks. i should try it out
[03:20:29] <Nasp> I am almost at the 20% profit  margin
[03:20:48] <bomb> JakeSays RPi 4 supporting dual 4K monitors @ 60 Hz sounds like it has a great GPU, but I might be wrong
[03:21:35] <JakeSays> bomb: i don't really know much about the gpu on the 4.
[03:22:03] <Nasp> I remember earlier version of raspberry pi could barely use a browser
[03:22:11] <Nasp> I think this was a rsapberry 2 maybe
[03:22:13] <JakeSays> Nasp: lol yup
[03:22:16] <irwiss> depends what "supporting" means, just pumping framebuffer to display is one thing, having enough execution units and pixel fillrate to do anything but that is entirely different
[03:22:20] <JakeSays> it's even sluggish on the three
[03:22:50] <Nasp> I wonder if the 4 will be better
[03:22:56] <JakeSays> i've been meaning to buy a pi 4 to use as my kvm controller
[03:22:58] <Nasp> Because would be nice to be able to use for an information screen
[03:23:05] <Nasp> We still haven't found good hardware or software for that at work
[03:23:24] <JakeSays> Nasp: jetson nanos work well for that
[03:25:15] <BSaboia> This thing of having to set VSTEST_HOST_DEBUG env var to 0 in order to debug a test project seems so hacky... but I cannot think of a better way
[03:25:35] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Can you but those?
[03:25:44] <Nasp> Also Raspberry pi 4 has like atleast one month delivery time
[03:25:45] <bomb> yeah, I was thinking as an information screen
[03:25:51] <irwiss> https://old.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/qtprya/gta_the_trilogy_has_a_metacritic_aggregate_score/hklm614/ kek
[03:25:54] <bomb> dual 1080p, not even 4K
[03:28:43] <Nasp> irwiss:  Should i read the reddit part of the article it links to?
[03:29:00] <Nasp> Ohh gta thought it was raspberry pi
[03:29:04] <Nasp> bomb:  PRetty sure it says 4k
[03:29:41] <Nasp> I'm almost out of stuff to drink :/
[03:32:50] <bomb> Nasp I mean, my setup is going to be dual 1080s, not even 4Ks they advertise
[03:32:53] <irwiss> Nasp: nah just the headline and the comment :P
[03:33:13] <bomb> of you fucker irwiss
[03:33:28] <bomb> I was wondering why I watched a 9-min video regarding what's removed from the original in GTA Trilogy
[03:33:54] <BSaboia> dotnet --list-sdks | grep -v '6.0.100' | awk '{ print $1 }' | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -I '{}' -0 sudo dotnet-core-uninstall remove '{}' --sdk --force --yes bye-bye, old SDKs :(
[03:37:39] <Nasp> nice
[03:37:52] <Nasp> That must mean you've upgraded everything
[03:38:13] <BSaboia> Nasp, yeah. Lost my lovely Sunday with that
[03:38:17] <irwiss> bomb: tldr nothing of value was added, music removed because rockstar want a cashgrab with minimum investment, games break in the new "more fps modes" anyway and if you bought it on day 1 you couldn't play it for over 12 hours because rockstar DRM servers are powered by 2 malnourished hamsters
[03:38:28] <BSaboia> This .NET Core 6.0 seems to be faster, so...
[03:38:47] <bomb> irwiss I hate DRM
[03:39:00] <JakeSays> Nasp: can i but what?
[03:39:14] <BSaboia> Nasp, this is the equivalent for runtimes: dotnet --list-runtimes | grep -v '6.0.0' | awk '{ print $2 }' | uniq | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -I -0 '{}' sudo dotnet-core-uninstall remove '{}' --runtime --yes
[03:39:26] <BSaboia> I am sometimes amazed how smoothly .NET Core runs on Linux
[03:39:28] <irwiss> to be fair tho, anyone still buying rockstar games on day 1 is a retard, i'm not even mentioning people preordering broken shit
[03:40:20] <JakeSays> Nasp: ah. you mean buy the nanos. yes
[03:40:33] <BSaboia> irwiss, then you should thank them. Otherwise everyone would've been waiting for others to buy, and then nobody would buy, and nobody would do the games
[03:40:35] <gufi> blech, i cannot get the taste of atomized oil out of my fucking mouth
[03:40:55] <bomb> irwiss I have downloaded thousands (all licensed releases) of NES, SNES, Sega Master System & Mega Drive ROMs. gaming is a solved problem here in my home.
[03:40:56] <JakeSays> gufi: next time use a water based lube
[03:41:16] <gufi> lol. spent 2 hours steam cleaning the transmission for the car
[03:41:24] <Nasp> BSaboia:  Only a sunday
[03:41:35] <bomb> irwiss NES is Famicom if you're outside of the US, Sega Mega Drive is Sega Genesis if you're inside the us.
[03:41:44] <irwiss> nah, everyone would buy games like you used to be buying before preorders, when game was actually released and not on promise of broken-on-release "but don't worry we have 33 pages of roadmap, we'll fix it soon(tm)"
[03:42:01] <irwiss> so, no i don't thank them, nor there is need to, they're retards buying into hype
[03:42:38] <Nasp> Rockstar and EA games -> poop
[03:43:10] <irwiss> bomb: yeah if you'e into pis there's even retropi
[03:43:46] <irwiss> wonder how it'll look like when steamdeck comes out, can probably load up thousands of roms and have gameboy on steroids
[03:43:49] <gufi> retro pi is pretty cool
[03:43:56] <bomb> irwiss Steam Deck is KDE!
[03:44:00] <JakeSays> finished my first spool of filament
[03:44:03] <bomb> isn't that awesome
[03:44:11] <bomb> they finally ditched the GNOME clusterfuck
[03:44:14] <gufi> JakeSays, grats! 30 more to go and you've matched me!
[03:44:27] <Nasp> I still wonder why nobody have made a console where oyu can chromecast
[03:44:28] <JakeSays> 30.. damn!
[03:44:35] <bomb> irwiss btw this is where I downloaded ROMs: https://r-roms.github.io/
[03:44:49] <irwiss> nice, wonder if there's plans to put some changes upstream
[03:44:53] <gufi> a ton of the filment i used was printing random bullshit for a while
[03:44:57] <JakeSays> gufi: i ordered a new printer today too
[03:45:10] <irwiss> cause kde is nice but has issues with some touchscreen stuff
[03:45:15] <bomb> possible. KDE guys are much more friendly than GNOME dipshits
[03:45:34] <gufi> started designing my own shit and it slowed down a ton. did design new shelf hangers and shit though because the ones at home depot are fucking garbage unless  you spend 3-4 bucks a piece
[03:46:15] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Which one?
[03:46:18] <Nasp> And do you have two now
[03:46:26] <Nasp> I havent set mine up yet
[03:46:42] <Nasp> Or set it up after it took it a bit aprt
[03:46:52] <BSaboia> Nasp, that was fast, wasn't it
[03:47:05] <BSaboia> But I am not sure that nothing broke. Tomorrow is another day
[03:47:10] <JakeSays> Nasp: just a cheap creality ender 3 v2 and yes
[03:47:11] <BSaboia> At least it is a holiday here
[03:48:20] <Nasp> We have no holyday on this side of the year, only christmas :/
[03:49:08] <Nasp> All holidays are in april, may and a single in june
[03:49:36] <Nasp> Ohh right there are no christmas holidays this year :/
[03:51:26] <JakeSays> did christmas get canceled?

[04:33:08] <bomb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MmCJvyfXqM
[04:33:08] <JakeSays> so then your vendor sold you a shitty power supply
[04:33:09] <irwiss> and basically running x11 and vnc practically paralyzed it for any other workload anyways
[04:33:25] <JakeSays> i have three of them and they work great
[04:33:35] <JakeSays> although i dont use them as a desktop
[04:33:40] <irwiss> it doesn't really matter, it could just barely run basic x11 desktop at 1080p
[04:33:57] <gufi> nano wasn't designed for that anyway was it?
[04:33:57] <irwiss> we just dumped them in the trash and got a few decent htpcs for the job

[13:02:36] <MatthiasVance> (sorry, a F# thing)
[13:02:45] <MatthiasVance> Or do you mean a source generator?
[13:03:15] <MaNa3k> something similar to this https://app.quicktype.io/ but for csv file
[13:05:30] <MaNa3k> a glass generator for deserializing a csv source to objects
[13:06:49] <biberu> MaNa3k: too many columns to type comfortably? if so i usually just copy the column names into an editor with regex capabilities and use those to generate a skeleton
[13:07:11] <MaNa3k> biberu, i usually use excel
[13:07:20] <biberu> but regex
[13:07:23] <MaNa3k> actually i first use notepad ++
[13:07:31] <MaNa3k> regex to remove all the delimitors
[13:07:37] <MaNa3k> then add newline to all the columsn
[13:07:42] <MaNa3k> then paste them to excel
[13:07:55] <Inge> regex search-replace in notepad++ is amazink
[13:08:01] <biberu> yeah
[13:08:02] <MaNa3k> then add all the nessasarry source code + column name + etc in bulk
[13:08:15] <biberu> you can do that directly in npp MaNa3k
[13:08:30] <Inge> the only reason I got around to learn about regex capture groups :S
[13:08:40] <biberu> if you mean e.g. adding getters, setters, semicolons etc?
[13:08:47] <biberu> (setters evil!)
[13:09:48] <MaNa3k> public string MyColumn {get;set;} this is how usually most of my columns are made to
[13:11:40] <biberu> MaNa3k: in npp, if you have a file with the lines foo/bar/baz: search for: `(.+)`, replace with: `public string \1 { get; set; }`, end result: three lines like public string foo { get; set; } / public string bar { get; set; } / public string baz { get; set; }
[13:11:41] <MaNa3k> in the old days, i used to do array[0] = col1,  array[1] = col2
[13:11:45] <MaNa3k> these days i just use reflections
[13:11:54] <MaNa3k> but is a pain doing all this every time,
[13:12:01] <biberu> MaNa3k: note the \1 in the replacement, it's a reference to the capture group
[13:13:10] <MaNa3k> mhm
[13:14:54] <Nasp> Is this how you guys code?
[13:15:02] <biberu> MaNa3k: does that help or do you still need excel? :)

[16:57:21] <planetcall|work> MaNa3k, use AutoMapper
[16:57:49] <planetcall|work> or create a class yourself which takes the old object and maps to the new structure
[16:58:15] <biberu> ew, automapper
[16:58:35] <MaNa3k> planetcall|work, well i went for csvhelper lib, works really nice
[16:58:55] <MaNa3k> i generated the sourcecode here https://toolslick.com/generation/code/class-from-csv
[16:58:56] <sysRPL> so canon once sold cameras like the powershot g1-10 ... and although they are 15 years old, i think they are still a good deal to buy for < $20
[16:59:10] <planetcall|work> CSVHelper deals with CSV files. You didn't mention it in your problem statement
[16:59:44] <sysRPL> because they can shoot 4k stills and have the guts inside to allow for remote camera control via usb
[17:00:36] <interop_madness> sysRPL, "guts inside to allow for remote camera control via usb" - link/elaborate?
[17:00:53] <sysRPL> which when hooked up with a power adapter and a pc can be used for great continuous timelapse movie capture when plugged into a pc with the right tools
[17:01:00] <MaNa3k> i still got my nikon d7000 dslr, takes nice pictures
[17:01:21] <interop_madness> nice
[17:01:29] <sysRPL> interop_madness: they had a canon sdk that allowed you to remotely controls their cameras
[17:01:56] <sysRPL> then MS went and scrwed the pooch with vista incompatibility after they shoveled out WIC
[17:02:02] <interop_madness> that sounds like a nice use case for a glaringly obvious home surveillance camera^^
[17:02:08] <sysRPL> WIC Windows Image Capture
[17:02:09] <MaNa3k> i think you can hookup a otg cable from your android phone to your dslr, and use this dlsr app to control em
[17:02:24] <sysRPL> and NO ONE uses WIC
[17:03:19] <sysRPL> well i wrote a whole toolkit on top of the open source libgphoto2

[17:03:45] <sysRPL> the G was originally for these G line of cameras

[22:47:21] <biberu> yes, but it makes it easier to contain to the initialization point
[22:47:53] <biberu> validating fields one by one isn't enough anyway, often you need to check the state is valid as a whole
[22:48:02] <JakeSays> indeed
[22:48:17] <JakeSays> well, sometimes isn't enough
