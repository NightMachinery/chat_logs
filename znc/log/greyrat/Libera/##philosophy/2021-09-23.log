[02:10:03] <biys> I_Am_M00t: well sure i mean...  mercaptan
[02:10:10] <biys> that isn't how it's typically done though
[02:10:27] <biys> duct isn't designed to be a sealed system
[02:10:32] <biys> unless it is
[02:11:16] <biys> which is typically associated for significant amounts of safety.  like a lab or something
[02:11:41] <biys> your common residential dwelling or an apartment, for eaxmple, would likely be allowed to leak as spec'd
[02:11:47] <biys> sometimes upto like 15%
[02:12:05] <biys> how it's typically tested is a random section of duct is disconnected and blocked off
[02:12:40] <biys> then they dump in a certain amount of cfm in one side and hope to get the same out the other
[02:13:15] <biys> actually i can't remember how they test it.  it would probably be like a blower door test in a residential house.

[02:13:18] <I_Am_M00t> biys: hmm, ill look up mercaptan. This is about a food odor issue between apartments
[02:13:39] <I_Am_M00t> so i was thinking spray something (safe) up the ducts of one apt, and see if it smells in the other
[02:13:51] <I_Am_M00t> to figure out which apartment the source of the odor is
[02:14:03] <biys> mercaptan is what they mix with natural gas to make it smell like rotten eggs
[02:14:14] <biys> but H2S also smells like rotten eggs... but if you smell it you're ded
[02:14:17] <biys> *shrug*
[02:14:19] <I_Am_M00t> right, huh.. lol. It doesn't have to smell bad, the thing we spray up
[02:14:25] <I_Am_M00t> it just has to smell of something, and be safe
[02:14:40] <I_Am_M00t> like it's just to test if there's "leakage"
[02:14:43] <biys> i'd.  blow a hoot into it
[02:14:54] <biys> if i was degen
[02:14:58] <biys> which i'm not
[02:15:06] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[02:15:06] <bougyman> You're a degen Ape.
[02:15:08] <bougyman> Admit it.
[02:16:12] <I_Am_M00t> cant you spray air freshener?
[02:16:15] <I_Am_M00t> or is it unsafe?
[02:16:43] <biys> idk what you mean unsafe
[02:16:58] <biys> will it explode?
[02:17:01] <biys> will it kill people?
[02:17:04] <biys> will it cause a fire?
[02:17:09] <biys> highly unlikely
[02:17:29] <I_Am_M00t> hmm ok, so is it "allowed" according to code?
[02:17:36] <I_Am_M00t> lol, like could you do that as a professional?
[02:17:37] <biys> when you watch that fuckin show with bruce willis when he's crawling through the inside of a duct
[02:18:04] <biys> on the inside of duct is just air
[02:18:05] <biys> so
[02:18:12] <biys> maybe some dust
[02:18:17] <I_Am_M00t> ye, but idk the regulations
[02:18:18] <biys> a bunch of pointy screws
[02:18:22] <biys> that would rip you to pieces
[02:18:32] <I_Am_M00t> yea, it's just metal tubing and air, but fuck do i know
[02:19:00] <I_Am_M00t> im gonna ask my stupid landlord to do it, i wanna make sure they dont have some defensive safety arguments
[02:19:54] <biys> i would think you couldn't be held responsible for the smell that crossed to a room
[02:19:57] <biys> if anything they would
[02:20:04] <biys> if you happened to spray some shit near the vent
[02:20:07] <biys> like air freshner or something
[02:20:12] <biys> and someone happened to smell it from their suite
[02:20:25] <biys> i really couldn't see any situation where you'd be held accountable for anything
[02:20:36] <biys> you might have additional neigbbours who smell it
[02:20:38] <biys> they might not be impressed
[02:20:47] <biys> but again... that isn't your problem
[02:22:06] <I_Am_M00t> i mean the other way around, the other apartment needs to spray
[02:22:12] <I_Am_M00t> i need to smell, to check if they are actually the source
[02:22:59] <I_Am_M00t> the landlord is shit slow to diagnose the problem, but they found an apartment who had an oven fan that was too strong, so it ruined the pressure in the central pump
[02:23:26] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[02:23:30] <I_Am_M00t> the food odor might leak due to that fan, but they're not gonna do "smell tests", but are simply replacing the fan
[02:23:48] <I_Am_M00t> they're too stupid to test things, they just replace blindly
[02:24:01] <biys> ruined the pressure in the central pump
[02:24:06] <biys> that's definitely interesting
