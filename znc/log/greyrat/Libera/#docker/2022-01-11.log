[00:36:07] <GunArm> can i change the "shell" by which docker exec {command} gets run from?  
[00:36:28] <GunArm> would it require a wrapper script as an entrypoint?
[00:39:31] <GunArm> trying to avoid    docker exec {shell -c} "{command}"
[00:40:29] <ikke> The entrypoint would be the receiver of {command}
[00:45:10] <larsks> ...is that true for docker exec?
[00:46:14] <larsks> ikke: I've just checked, and then entrypoint is *not* the receiver of the command in `docker exec`

[00:50:16] <ikke> larsks: as the command suggests, it execs the thing you specify
[00:50:29] <ikke> so there is no shell involved
[00:50:43] <larsks> ikke: you said "The entrypoint would be the receiver of {command}", which is not the case.
[00:50:45] <ikke> docker exec -it foobar 'true && echo bar'
[00:50:53] <larsks> The docker ENTRYPOINT isn't involved.
[00:50:59] <ikke> larsks: yeah, in a normal run context, not for exec
[00:51:26] <ikke> But, like I said, there is no shell involved either
[00:52:18] <ikke> So if you want a shell, you need to explicitly provide it
[00:52:28] <GunArm> interesting, "no shell involved", there has to be some default shell right?  something has to parse the args and feed them to the executable?

[00:52:42] <GunArm> maybe those words don't make sense...
[00:53:06] <ikke> GunArm: your shell is parsing the args, and provides them to docker exec
[00:53:21] <ikke> which in turn forwards everything after the container name to exec 
[00:53:39] <ikke> You don't need a shell to execute commands

[00:56:49] <ikke> Without a shell, you can only execute a single command (ie, exec does not know about ;
[00:57:23] <GunArm> offtopic, but i would have thought, without a shell, there's nothing to translate your input string at all, and you'd be left with assembly instructions or something
[00:58:03] <ikke> The kernel can execute programs without needing a shell
[00:58:28] <GunArm> hm ok I'm probably melding the shell and the kernel together in my mind
[00:58:41] <ikke> your shell does a syscall to execute programs, but other programs can use those syscalls as well
[00:59:19] <rawtaz> GunArm: think in terms of `man 3 exec`
[00:59:59] <GunArm> oh right ok

[03:54:49] <GunArm> dumb question:
[03:54:58] <rawtaz> super dumb
[03:55:01] <rawtaz> :>
[03:55:18] <GunArm> i've got this (windows) docker server I set up 2 years ago, and I need to update it, but I can't figure out how I installed it, to update it
[03:55:31] <GunArm> as of today my impression is docker desktop is the only windows way to install it
[03:55:37] <GunArm> but that was not installed, only the service
[03:56:21] <GunArm> i tried to install newer docker desktop over it, and they were both running (the new one couldn't start though probably cause the old one was holding locks) and then I uninstalled the new one and the old one chugging along
[03:56:46] <GunArm> what have I done lol?  is there some weird way to install it with powershell repos?
[03:57:49] <GunArm> this is specifically for running windows containers
[03:58:14] <GunArm> which might be relevant since there seems to be alterative ways to install it (WSL2) that I suspect don't allow windows containers
[03:59:16] <rawtaz> hm i have no idea, but maybe if you look at some older documentation for that docker version on how to install it in windows?
[03:59:22] <rawtaz> im guessing it was some WSL thing?
[04:00:14] <GunArm> lol.  so 2 years ago I wrote a wiki about this
[04:00:19] <GunArm> internal wiki
[04:00:21] <GunArm> `Install-Package Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -Force`
[04:00:45] <GunArm> its enterprise edition i guess

[17:57:34] <programmerq> Rohambili▸ https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/41831 - this seems to be describing the issue you're talking about? You might be able to use KillMode=mixed or KillMode=control-group in the systemd unit in question to help kill all processes in the container if you're not using an init (like docker run --init ...)
[17:58:53] <programmerq> Okas▸ if you're doing development, it's not unheard of to bind mount the copy of the code you are working on to the container. That way you can run your text editor/ide/whatever on your regular host with all your regular settings and the changes are reflected in the bind mount in the container in real time.
[17:59:48] <programmerq> if you're just occasionally trying to do some editing/inspection when your run vim inside a 'docker exec' session, then there's no really good/clean way to copy those files out without a wrapper script or bind mount.

[20:35:33] <pikaro> Hi! I'm having a problem with writing to stdout in supervisord-spawned scripts in this setup: https://github.com/dr-yd/stdout-permission-denied/tree/development despite being owned by the correct user, /proc/$$/fd/{1,2} are not writable by scheduled scripts. there are some references to this issue but none are very helpful and they all seem to result in bad workarounds like running as root etc.
[20:35:35] <pikaro> sample output is provided in the readme, I've made the example as minimal as I could.
[20:36:13] <pikaro> Are there any obvious mistakes I'm making here?

[20:56:46] <tabakhase> that aint making much sense
[20:58:29] <tabakhase> and fireing supervisord with "&" into the background makes this even less reasonable :D

[21:00:08] <tabakhase> either supervisord becomes the daddy - or more-dockerish, your script likely belongs into its own container...

[23:12:12] <gebbione> upgrading that is out of scope for now
[23:13:00] <tabakhase> 2.4 should be rather problemfree - but yes i agree that that kinda shouldnt be the problem
[23:17:28] <gebbione> The output of docker compose images -> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/pTCM948GBz/ I have an override file too but that does not contain an image: specification. It is just needed to build some files that get copied over in these images (composer is run, if you are familiar with that)
[23:18:23] *** Quits: vidbina (~vid@213.94.3.130) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:19:18] <tabakhase> hm then first inbetween, your "depends_on: composer" likely should be inside your override file as well ;-)
[23:19:41] <gebbione> ohhh yea
[23:20:01] <gebbione> but i bet that does not make a difference :)
[23:20:14] <tabakhase> and then that seems to be working as intended, but your containers have drifted
[23:20:40] <gebbione> interesting though, on rancher it does not complaint about that depends
[23:21:04] <tabakhase> flip your images against a "docker-compose config" and see what tags it prints
[23:21:15] <tabakhase> maybe your $TAG isnt set there - what would be that drift...
[23:21:52] <gebbione> so run docker-compose config without the TAG variable?
[23:21:56] <gebbione> or with
[23:22:01] <gebbione> i ll try both

[23:23:17] <gebbione> :( i dont get it
[23:23:25] <tabakhase> key here would be that "docker-compose images" is `List images used by the created containers` -- doesnt give a shit about your compsoe-file "technically"
[23:23:39] <gebbione> make sense
[23:23:55] <tabakhase> so maybe thats an XYProblem now? :D what ya actually wanne do? :P

[23:27:22] <tabakhase> so its not "image: registry.gitlab.com/bizmate/app/php5:"  but actually "image: registry.gitlab.com/bizmate/app/php5:SomeTagYouHadUsed"? - then ye, its just that those images moved/tags deleted and your container is an older gen i think
[23:27:43] <gebbione> indeed
[23:27:49] <gebbione> you can see the tag in the last line
[23:27:57] <gebbione> of the first paste
[23:28:09] <gebbione> the one for rabbitmq
[23:28:21] <gebbione> so yea looks weird
[23:30:05] <tabakhase> if normal "up" doesnt line things up everything may be just fine but it doesnt know :D - in that case you can try adding a "--force-recreate"
[23:30:54] <gebbione> i m forcing a build right now
[23:31:01] <gebbione> lets see if i get new hashes
[23:31:23] <gebbione> somehow with caching it was not building things again
[23:31:37] <gebbione> (or maybe i am just tired of looking at the screen for so long)
[23:32:16] <gebbione> ok something is not quite right
[23:32:25] <gebbione> docker-compose push also does nothing :/
[23:35:18] <gebbione> you were right about being disaligned btw
[23:35:24] <gebbione> --force-recreate did it
