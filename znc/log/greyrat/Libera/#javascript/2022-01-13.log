[00:13:55] <Howdy_McGee> Hmm, yeah that does it. I guess during the catch() the Promise isn't quite fulfilled yet? I was hoping to console.warn it there and not return anything.
[00:14:13] <Decker> right
[00:14:48] <Decker> during a catch you have the ability to replace the failure with a success
[00:15:16] <Howdy_McGee> That makes sense. Thanks!

[04:01:32] <systemfault> It's a bundler, by default it's a JS bundler
[04:02:08] <systemfault> There are plugins to generate HTML and a ton of other things... but they have to be installed and configured
[04:02:59] <systemfault> Your config will only take your ./src/index.js file and bundle it with its dependencies to a file called main.js

[04:05:34] <bobdobbs> The guide says to "open the index.html from the dist directory..."... so I assumed that the file index.html would actually be generated there.
[04:06:42] <systemfault> Webpack doesn't even know that "page.html" exists
[04:07:21] <systemfault> page.html is just some dummy page that loads the generated bundle

[05:44:34] <dimino> whatever two things being compared there are called lol
[05:45:04] <gehn> ah if you're talking about only the "modules" part, then sure that makes more sense
[05:45:36] <gehn> they're called "ES Modules" and "CommonJS"
[05:45:40] <dimino> ah okay
[05:45:47] <gehn> as in, it's what's in the title
[05:45:58] <dimino> so what's the ES there mean vs ES in ES6?
[05:46:07] <gehn> ECMASports
[05:46:39] <dimino> so I was right initially then :)
[05:46:47] <gehn> and it's the same in either case
[05:46:56] <gehn> ecma is still ecma
[05:47:24] <gehn> dimino, er, no... you originally asked if you should be "writing es6"
[05:47:42] <gehn> that phrasing is asking about language version, not about modules
[05:47:45] <dimino> yeah it's the second major revisiion to javascript

[05:48:06] <dimino> 6*
[05:48:19] <gehn> these days it just goes by the year
[05:48:32] <gehn> ES6 isn't really a thing anymore
[05:48:40] <dimino> commonjs is an alternative specification
[05:48:57] <dimino> so "should I write commonjs or es6" is a valid question
[05:48:58] <gehn> dimino, you're confusing the language with the modules system
[05:49:03] <gehn> dimino, it is not
[05:49:06] <dimino> specification
[05:49:10] <dimino> they are two different specifications
[05:49:14] <silly> it's cjs vs esm
[05:49:23] <dimino> code is written to a specification
[05:49:28] <silly> esm is part of es6
[05:49:30] <Slade> dimino, "should i write in commonjs or usbc"
[05:49:44] <dimino> well that's a fine point
[05:50:12] <dimino> "should I write javascript that conforms to the ES6 or commonjs specification?"
[05:50:20] <gehn> nope
[05:50:27] <dimino> yep?
[05:50:29] <gehn> nope
[05:50:31] <silly> lol
[05:50:34] <dimino> yep * infinity
[05:50:40] <gehn> esm vs commonjs makes sense to ask about
[05:50:54] <silly> the answer to your question depends on who you ask
[05:51:02] <gehn> should I drive a car or a fish bowl?
[05:51:09] <silly> i'd suggest writing es6 with cjs

[05:52:11] <silly> if you build your frontend with webpack in node, then use esm
[05:52:19] *** pmercado_ is now known as pmercado
[05:52:27] <samsch> dimino, it's ESM vs CJS. ES6 is an old fake name for ES2015, and nobody should be writing ES2015 at all because you would use ES2021 right now (and that would be with either ESM or CJS).
[05:52:59] <dimino> I do build my frontend with webpack, and that does use esm
[05:53:04] <silly> es6+ is popular too

[05:53:41] <dimino> but for the backend you're saying cjs is going to be the thing ppl still expect?
[05:53:57] <silly> as i said, depends on who you ask
[05:54:00] <gehn> I mean, cjs *is* node
[05:54:05] <gehn> like that's where cjs came from
[05:54:06] <samsch> dimino, Yeah, sort of. Webpack can parse ESM, though it actually fakes it and makes it work like CJS, because ✨reasons✨
[05:54:28] <samsch> CJS is the safer bet for Node code.
[05:54:51] <Slade> relinking https://xkcd.com/927/
[05:54:54] <dimino> is it a valid reason to want the code front and back to look as similar as possible to try and coax shy developers towards the backend?
[05:54:58] <samsch> Both specs will continue to be used in Node, and CJS will continue to work better because of the mistakes made introducing ESM.
[05:55:08] <dimino> ahhh mistakes in implementation
[05:55:13] <dimino> nope I want nothing to do with that
[05:55:14] <silly> there's nothing unsafe with esm in node
[05:55:28] <silly> it work and won't stop working
[05:56:07] <silly> it's just not downwards compatible unless you use babel and i think it's still an experimental feature
[05:56:15] <silly> and i think it's terrible
[05:56:45] <silly> with .mjs and you have to use filename extensions when importing and you can't import json
[05:56:56] <dimino> oh gross
[05:56:56] <samsch> Who said anything about "unsafe"? I said CJS works better, and it does. They are both "safe" in any meaningful ways. But like, that's true of JS in general outside of external apis (fs), and a few language features you avoid in 99.9% of cases, like eval.

[05:57:57] <silly> thought the opposite was unsafer bet...
[05:58:18] <silly> and i doubt that there is better and worse...
[05:58:23] <samsch> "unsafe" and "safe bet" have different connotation contexts and applications
[05:59:05] <samsch> "safe bet" has nothing to do with safety. "unsafe" is more literally "dangerous"

[06:00:12] <samsch> dimino, Wanting to use the same module system for front and back is a valid desire, and you might find that merit to be higher than the benefits of CJS. Or you may find it makes more sense to use CJS in both places
[06:01:03] <samsch> why tf am I still on IRC at 9:30pm though
[06:01:07] <silly> my suggestion is you keep esm with webpack/eslint and use cjs with node
[06:01:41] <dimino> hm ok, I'll think about it, it doesn't sound like I'm totaly crazy but it comes with some tradeoffs
[06:02:49] <samsch> The problems with ESM for Node are *much* worse for packages than for projects.
[06:03:52] <silly> as a package maintainer you can just provide both
[06:04:07] <samsch> In either case, you can "use" them via Babel and compile them to CJS, which fixes most of the problems (except conditional/dynamic synchronous import). And you can also use .mjs files, which works fine-ish.
[06:05:11] *** Quits: dodobrain (~dodobrain@user/dodobrain) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:05:14] <samsch> You can provide both, but the cross-compile results are still nasty in either case, and if your package is stateful at all (looking at you, React), it can break things if you have deps importing the two different versions.

[09:48:55] <bobdobbs> I'm creating a webpack config. I've installed the devserver module, and have configured it to run on port 9000 while webpack watches for file changes. Currently when I run 'npx webpack', the command prompt doesn't return, so I assume that webpack is watching. However, if I visit 'http://localhost:9000', my browser basically shrugs at me. "This site can't be reached"
[09:49:02] <sickdyd> what would you reccomend for a simple static website? Gatsby? I'd like to use React
[09:49:08] <bobdobbs> This is my config: http://pastie.org/p/4OBl1k9398YTXjquHsmJXi
[09:49:17] <sickdyd> I used Next.js previously, but it would be nice to try something new
[09:49:19] <matsaman> javascript has the advantage of already being supported OOTB client-side in browsers, but ... I mean these days you could use python client side on the fly if you really wanted to
[09:49:31] <theskillwithin> sickdyd yes Gatsby
[09:50:14] <theskillwithin> sickdyd yes knowing both Next.js and Gatsby is a very good thing

[09:51:48] <oscurochu> i was having a conversation with gehn about organizational updates, and how tedious it is to change stuff around all the time. thats when he mentioned writing bash scripts. then he mentioned bash actually sucks, and that it would be worth my time to learn python even if the only thing i used it for was for bash style scripting
[09:53:23] <matsaman> oh helll yeah https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatsby_(sandwich)
[09:53:29] <oscurochu> i get really nervous about automated updates with scripts, so i've always stayed away from it. but i should be even more nervous about wasting hours of time doing everything manually just to organize my file structure differently if somehow i realize the orginazational structure is no longer working

[09:55:36] <matsaman> yeah pretty ugly syntax sometimes, at least compared to python
[09:55:57] <matsaman> especially if you try for multi-sh-compatible sh rather than bash alone

[09:56:09] <matsaman> not ordinarily
[09:56:17] <matsaman> bash is highly available
[09:58:24] <oscurochu> what i dont like about python is the lack of support in their discord chat. if you have to start your own chat, and if you don't get your questions answered in a predetermined period of time, you have to open a new chat and ask your question again. and there are too many chats, so there is no way you are going to get more than one perspective about your problem. i havent tried the python irc chat yet. but their discord sucks imho

[11:41:24] <silly> yes, don't worry if your confused, b/c it all is confusing
[11:41:27] <fef> where to ask npm + webpack question
[11:42:11] <oscurochu> bobdobbs whats your package.json file look like?

[11:42:34] *** Quits: Betal (~Betal@user/betal) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[11:45:30] <oscurochu> i haven't used a file that looks like that, except maybe when i was first playing with webpack.
[11:45:42] <bobdobbs> ok, something might be happening after removing the 'watch' parameter... If I navigate to http://localhost:9000 the browser hangs
[11:45:43] <oscurochu> what is your goal once you get webpack setup?
[11:46:17] <oscurochu> i feel like webpack is the hard way.
[11:46:20] <bobdobbs> So it doesn't return a "browser shrug". something might be listening.
[11:46:31] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: webpack is webpack the hard way
[11:46:48] <oscurochu> so what is your goal once you setup webpack?
[11:46:55] <oscurochu> have you considered using express?
[11:47:03] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: bascially two things:
[11:47:32] <bobdobbs> thing one: set up build tooling for basic React apps (I don't know React yet)...
[11:47:40] <silly> https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#overlay is only valid in {devServer:client:{...}}
[11:47:41] <oscurochu> awesome.
[11:47:59] <bobdobbs> thing two: build tooling for basic html/css/js stuff. ie, for wordpress plugins
[11:48:14] <oscurochu> i highly recommend you skip over the whole webpack thing. its not exactly a good stepping stone. anything you do now, you will have to do again later do fit into your react app
[11:48:18] <bobdobbs> thing three: prove to myself that I'm not a clueless loser stuck in the 1990's web
[11:48:23] <oscurochu> would you mind taking a different approach to all this?

[11:48:50] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: I'm a bullheaded idiot fixated on the idea of bending webpack to my will. Sorry. I will be difficult to dissuade
[11:49:14] <oscurochu> npx create-react-app my-app; cd my-app; npm start
[11:49:21] <oscurochu> webpack is built into react
[11:49:34] <silly> not into react
[11:49:38] <oscurochu> there is nothing useful you are going to get out of what you are doing if you are planning on using react anyways
[11:49:43] <silly> but into cra
[11:49:53] <silly> cra = create-react-app
[11:50:57] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: well, I need to learn modern tooling anyway. I'll be doing other stuff besides React.
[11:51:03] <oscurochu> setting up a react server that already has webpack stuff token care of is going to save you a huge headache.
[11:51:23] <silly> which i have never used, i still stick to plain webpack/babel/eslint/react
[11:51:23] <bobdobbs> sure. that'll solve one of my problems. And not another of my problems
[11:51:31] <oscurochu> what is the other problem
[11:51:58] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: I want to use modern build tooling for things I'm already doing...
[11:52:46] <oscurochu> i guess i'd have to know what you are doing to understand how webpack would help you then
[11:53:16] <bobdobbs> At the moment I'm using gulp for concatening/minifying js and sass.. But gulp needs to be wired to something like webpack anyway to use things like js's 'import'
[11:53:36] *** Joins: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo)
[11:53:46] <bobdobbs> I figure if I'm going to be learning modern js, then I should learn modern tooling.
[11:53:57] <bobdobbs> When I ask people which tooling I should use, they keep pointing to webpack
[11:54:23] <bobdobbs> I know that when I'm trying to set up webpack, people say "you shouldn't use webpack, you should use Product X"...
[11:54:26] <silly> i'm not sure you still need gulp with webpack, i've never use those 2 together
[11:54:54] <bobdobbs> ... but if I ask for support with Product X people will just say "that's dumb. you should use Product Y".
[11:55:08] <bobdobbs> I figure instead of jumping all over the place I should just learn... something
[11:55:12] <oscurochu> it only seems that way
[11:55:18] <bobdobbs> and webpack seems as good as anywhere to start
[11:55:24] <oscurochu> i disagree.

[11:57:38] <oscurochu> but for backend, there arent many worth spending your time on, in my opnion. i wouldnt waste my time with webpack.

[11:57:53] <oscurochu> webpack is like trying to code javascript web sites with c++
[11:58:09] <oscurochu> they both work but one way is just going to be  a lot more boilerplace

[11:58:42] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[11:58:57] <silly> if you want to skip webpack configuration, use cra or any webpack-react-boilerplate from github
[11:59:00] <bobdobbs> oh yeah... preferably it'd be well-documented and have a community around it that caters to people trying to learn it
[11:59:13] <silly> cra uses webpack
[11:59:41] <oscurochu> react uses web pack, which is why you should not use webpack
[12:00:01] <silly> there's nothing wrong with not using cra
[12:00:04] <oscurochu> because by using react, you are automatically using webpack. but without the boilerplate of setting up webpack.
[12:00:12] <silly> and no react doesn't use webpack
[12:00:15] <silly> at no point
[12:00:17] <oscurochu> oh
[12:00:21] <oscurochu> im wrong again
[12:00:22] <oscurochu> lol
[12:00:27] <silly> react and webpack have nothing to do with each other
[12:00:38] <silly> cra uses webpack
[12:00:48] <oscurochu> oh
[12:00:50] <silly> and does the configuration for you
[12:01:36] <The_Blode> Good morning all happy new year. Quick question.
[12:01:41] <bobdobbs> silly: that's fine. But if I do the config myself then I can fix things when they break
[12:01:55] <The_Blode> Javascript...does the Javascript engine care if we terminate lines properly?
[12:02:01] <silly> yes, and if you do it yourself they are more likely to break
[12:02:08] <bobdobbs> truedat
[12:02:17] <silly> nothing wrong with it
[12:02:20] <The_Blode> For example var = 1; (this is my default style) and then var = 1 var_two = 2
[12:02:25] <The_Blode> No line termination

[12:03:55] <bobdobbs> Sooo... if I decided to give up on webpack now and just use cra for React things... what would be good for non-React things?
[12:04:09] <The_Blode> So I've been coding with semicolons by default. I have noticed some devs in my team not terminating lines.
[12:04:23] <The_Blode> So we have to rely on ASI if the engine supports it
[12:04:24] <bobdobbs> Like, just for processing js/sass while running a dev server with browsersync?
[12:05:31] <silly> bobdobbs, at this point, i'm all react/webpack, so i'm out of the loop, dunno about the outside world
[12:05:33] <bobdobbs> ... and for extreme bonus points, when I get stuck using it and ask questions, will have a userbase actually big enough to entertain noob questions?
[12:05:39] <oscurochu> i'd rather spent 5 minutes on cra than spend a week setting up webpack. if my webpack gets messed up, what if it takes me another week to get it fixed. if i use cra, if something gets messed up, in five minutes i have a working setup, no config necessary. it even watches my files for me
[12:06:41] <silly> The_Blode, asi is part of the specification, so every engine will support it
[12:07:07] <silly> The_Blode, you should also use eslint with a sane configuration
[12:07:21] <silly> when i say you, i mean your team
[12:07:41] <silly> so that everybody follows the same style guide

[12:08:01] <oscurochu> bobdobbs yes exactly
[12:08:10] <The_Blode> For me, I prefer the guys to terminate lines manually as is traditional

[12:10:49] <bobdobbs> I can't do this without using newer js... which I can't do with my current tooling

[12:23:35] <bobdobbs> (as far as I can tell anyway)
[12:24:13] <bobdobbs> Like... just setting up a toolchain with transpilation, live server, sass etc

[12:44:53] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: having that same tendancy, I should probably follow that same path
[12:46:06] <oscurochu> i like anything that integrates well into npm though, because npm provides the packages that can be imported as modules. you can make your own npm packages also. npx doesnt really have that much to offer. npm can give you npx, but npx cant give you npm.
[12:48:18] <oscurochu> if i wanna setup 5 servers, im probably not going to want to setup webpack for all of them, then setup react, then setup babel, etc. that takes too much time, its really easy to make mistakes that just slow you down.
[12:50:08] <oscurochu> i dont have very much experience with webpack to have a positive review on it. all i can say is that if i've been using webpack this whole time, and i've been able to do everything i need to do still using modern js, do i really need to learn that "one thing" ?

[12:51:31] <Maxdamantus> Dunno. But I'm guessing some popular website just turned it on, not sure what.
[12:51:58] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: my understanding is that it is pretty experimental. Apache doesn't even an http3 module yet, partly because they don't the stability of the spec yet
[12:52:42] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: afaict, the only reaons http3 is available at all is because LiteSpeed chooses to support an unstable spec... partly to claw a little bit more marketshare
[12:53:01] <bobdobbs> but it's out there alright.
[12:53:17] <bobdobbs> There are plenty of sites powered by LiteSpeed
[12:53:56] <bobdobbs> And if you are an admin running LiteSpeed then you've got no reason not to turn on http3. I believe it's enabled by default
[12:56:09] <solrize> are there any http3 clients to speak of?
[12:56:16] <bobdobbs> yes

[13:08:15] <Maxdamantus> In general you don't really need to. http2 should basically just transparently work as an automatic optimisation of http2.
[13:08:25] <Maxdamantus> er, automatic optimisation of http1.1
[13:09:36] <Maxdamantus> If you're using typical modern http software (for servers this is at least true for reverse proxies), then you're probably already using http2.

[13:10:50] <Maxdamantus> and if you're using a reverse proxy, the main benefit will be between the user's browser (which probably supports http2) and the reverse proxy (which might support http2 if it's somewhat recent).
[13:11:01] <oscurochu> Catch me before I get too far, but adonisjs looks really promising. and It might not be very hard to migrate from express. I'm not sure if I should continue unit testing or if i should start the migrations sooner than later, and build the new tests aronud the new changes
[13:11:12] <Maxdamantus> between a reverse proxy and your application is unlikely to be very important, because generally that connection will be low-latency anyway.

[14:56:27] <jaawerth> oscurochu: my philosophy on that front is to do my best not to get so overboard that I'm working against the flow of the lang. e.g. in teh case of JS, if you really try to do so to the point of parity was an actual FP language then every interaction will have to be through a library ecosystem and you mgiht as well use a functional compile-to-js language instead
[14:56:50] <jaawerth> so I try to strike a compromise for multi-paradigm languages like JS and give some ground to OOP
[14:56:57] <jaawerth> and/or procedural code

[14:59:45] <jaawerth> if you can control every level of a projct to the point that you're always going through, like, the fantasyland ecosystem or everything is using ImmutableJS then ok, otherwise it's going to end up being definitely cleanly where everythign is and isn't pure

[15:20:39] <silly> at least fashion wise, their lifestyle doesn't seem to be much different from the rest of the community, they get to wear hoodies like everybody else https://www.teepublic.com/hoodie/2048821-fantasyland

[15:41:39] <jaawerth> I often don't bother to babel on backend but that doesn't mean it isn't a good idea. that said, that plugin is one of a number of ways people have workedo ut to hack around having to use relative paths when requiring/importing local modules
[15:42:42] <jaawerth> by using compilation to turn it into a relative require based on the root dir known at require time. I've used similar before (babel-plugin-transform-module-resolver or -transform-module-alias or something, one was deprecated for the other I think). it works, but.. I don't really recommend it
[15:43:08] *** Joins: mishiranu (~mishiranu@78.129.171.229)
[15:43:17] <jaawerth> it adds an extra layer of abstraction between you and what's going on in the project and it will confuse any tooling that isn't integrated directly with babel when it's parsing the code

[20:38:35] <banana_> ljharb: basically because youre leveraging the flexibility of js supporting functions as first class citizens?
[20:38:37] <ljharb> z1haze: it's something PHP also has
[20:38:48] <ljharb> z1haze: like if VAR has "foo", then `${{VAR}}` is like `${foo}`

[20:39:04] <z1haze> why would you ever do that?
[20:39:10] <z1haze> i guess that's more my question
[20:39:15] <ljharb> z1haze: people do all kinds of crazy things, i dunno
[20:39:24] <z1haze> haha, i mean their docs do it

[20:39:50] <banana_> ljharb: and that flexibility is not needing to replace an instance with an instance with the same set of methods, but instead replace the function value with the one you want?

[20:41:05] <ljharb> z1haze: that might be github actions substitution stuff
[20:41:11] <banana_> I'm trying to figure out the precise answer why it's more flexibility to use first class citizen function values vs instance methods
[20:41:25] <banana_> and I think it's because instance methods youre tied to an instance
[20:41:27] <ljharb> z1haze: hard to be sure with no context

[20:41:35] <jellobot> banana_, In JavaScript, verbs are equally important as nouns. http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html

[20:42:05] <z1haze> the context of executing a script, here's the actual `sfdx force:org:create -f config/project-scratch-def.json -w 60 --setalias CI-${{steps.vars.outputs.sha_short}} --durationdays 10 --setdefaultusername --json --loglevel fatal`
[20:42:09] <banana_> I already read that
[20:42:17] <banana_> but maybe I could read it again.
[20:42:45] <z1haze> i think im reading the ${{ }} is evaluated as an expression
[20:43:02] <z1haze> which in this context i dont believe makes sense, as its not an expression
[20:44:11] <banana_> I think the flexibility of just using function values, that arent instance methods, is it's easier to replace a different function with the same interface than an entire instance with the same interface

[20:48:01] <ljharb> banana_: read that until you understand it
[20:48:14] <banana_> what I think I'm figuring it out
[20:48:17] <ljharb> banana_: and yes, that is also true - prefer composition over inheritance
[20:48:19] <banana_> right arent I
[20:48:47] <banana_> yeah but with instances you can use composition so I dont think that describes it further why using functions is better
[20:49:05] <banana_> you can compose an instance in another instance method or function
[20:49:38] <banana_> I'm talking about why functions themselves are superior to instance methods
[20:49:40] <ljharb> the instance itself is not composed of other things
[20:49:58] <ljharb> and since instances almost always imply shared mutable state, it's actually not easy to compose them with other things
[20:50:03] <banana_> oh that's what you meant
[20:50:12] <banana_> like a function can compose another function
[20:50:28] <banana_> instead of an instance method that just calls a bunch of private instance methods
[20:50:32] <ljharb> yes

[20:52:49] <systemfault> I was definitely tainted by Java... but you know, a few years of seeing a psychologist can fix that!
[20:53:32] <Covrus> I like using JS classes like java, except where they're radically different, then I try to use them like they're JS
[20:54:01] <ljharb> Covrus: they're radically different in almost every way. just not in the surface syntax.
[20:54:48] <systemfault> ljharb: On a more practical level, I'd probably write my FP stuff as classes because of chaining (Better DX) if it wasn't that methods can't be tree shaken
[20:55:32] <ljharb> i mean, not to push anyone towards classes, but if treeshaking provides you a benefit it means you were sloppy and imported more than you needed
[20:55:41] <ljharb> but sure, pipeline will fix the DX of that

[22:19:30] <EdFletcher> woah wait, you mean there's more to a job as a software developer than _just_ sitting in front of a computer and banging out lines of code? and maybe our interview processes should take that into account instead of focusing on one narrow aspect of a well-rounded team player?

[22:23:22] <ljharb> that seinfeld episode was like what, 30 years ago?
[22:24:27] <ox1eef> in a way 20 years, even 30, feels like yesterday
[22:25:16] <ljharb> how old are you and me both that that's true
[22:25:36] <silly> who's seinfeld?
[22:25:37] <ljharb> also, that article called seinfeld "vintage" - wtf economist, what'd i ever do to you
[22:26:25] <silly> stupid paywall, reading iz in devtools network pane ;/
[22:26:55] <KevinX> "vintage" :(

[22:28:37] <KevinX> i'm 39 so this show was a part of my childhood (after saved by the bell, of course). I'm vintage I guess. It hurts
[22:28:49] <systemfault> I can relate...
[22:28:52] <EdFletcher> i kid you not, i had a (terrible) manager once who told a friend, who was themselves going into management soon that their only goal should be (and i quote because i recall it so clearly): "use your people to make you look good."
[22:28:54] <EdFletcher> not only is this just awful, but i'm just realizing now it fits this "performative work" concept (TIL!) -- i've seen it a bunch but never really had a term for it, this is great. thanks for the link silly!
[22:29:10] <ljharb> KevinX: yes same but that means we watched *reruns*, not initial syndication
[22:29:18] <ljharb> KevinX: saved by the bell at least was actually new for us
[22:29:36] <ljharb> KevinX: seinfeld came out in the 80s, hopefully well before either of us watched it
[22:30:00] <KevinX> I remember the finale hype though
[22:30:15] <EdFletcher> oh and it was such a terrible episode of TV too :/
[22:30:46] <KevinX> I didn't actually watch much TV in high school though. Only on the weekends I think
[22:31:44] <EdFletcher> we definitely watched Full House & America's Funniest regularly as kids. loosing Bob Saget recently was a gut punch.
[22:31:45] <KevinX> So I probably watched reruns of everything except family matters and the simpsons or whatever was on friday nights at 8
[22:32:14] <EdFletcher> oh boy Urkle, haven't thought about that show in years. such a hit.
[22:32:23] <KevinX> I saw Saget live without being warned he wasn't the guy from my childhood lol
[22:32:28] <EdFletcher> LMAO
[22:32:41] <EdFletcher> yeah the real Bob Saget was _nothing_ like "as seen on TV" 😆
[22:32:52] <EdFletcher> which was what made him _so awesome_
[22:32:58] <ljharb> KevinX: lol
