[02:35:42] <NC256> Is there somebody who could give me a hand with this weird FFmpeg behavior I'm experiencing? Or at least lend me their ear? I've run out of ideas on how to troubleshoot
[02:36:30] *** Quits: wootehfoot (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:37:10] <durandal_1707> what is the issue?
[02:37:48] <NC256> I'm trying to use the NVENC encoder to, well, encode, but it keeps silently failing with no error messages
[02:38:08] <NC256> It spits out a file with a couple dozen bytes and then FFmpeg just stops, no crash messages, just silently dies
[02:38:38] <NC256> Even with debug level logging there's no *obvious* error messages anywhere
[02:38:53] <NC256> Nvenc initializes successfully, and then encodes nothing
[02:39:04] <durandal_1707> sorry, not really into nvidia encoders..
[02:39:49] <NC256> Would you happen to know anybody or anywhere that would be?

[02:40:42] <durandal_1707> reddit/ffmpeg or here at random time, try latest drivers?
[02:40:42] <BtbN> Does the video you are encoding contain complex SEI data?
[02:41:05] <NC256> How would I find out?
[02:41:19] <BtbN> No idea
[02:41:25] <BtbN> try -extra_sei 0 and see if it stops crashing.

[02:43:40] <BtbN> Nvidia fixed this crash in driver 495+
[02:43:46] <BtbN> (which is not released yet...)
[02:44:12] <NC256> Good to know and good to know...
[02:44:33] <NC256> I guess I need to figure out what SEI data is while I'm waiting for that driver release

[02:45:04] <BtbN> and a bunch of other random stuff
[02:46:24] <NC256> Good to know
[02:46:36] <NC256> Well thank you so much, I was honestly not expecting to find a solution to this problem :p

[19:04:15] <Arifd> Hi guys, I have looked into a bug on the bug tracker, and I don't believe it's a bug. Can I make a post explaining why, and then one of you review it to make sure i'm not being dumb, and then delete it if yes
[19:06:40] <durandal_1707> which bug report?
[19:07:12] <Arifd> https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/9410
[19:08:08] <Arifd> The reason is I tested it with the official library sample video (the skiing one) and it works, I get black borders as expected: http://public.hronopik.de/vid.stab/features.php?lang=en

[19:09:53] <durandal_1707> Arifd: just write your thoughts there
[19:10:28] <Arifd> okay, can i upload the sample video anywhere?
[19:10:52] <Arifd> basically, if you follow michael's process with the sample video, instead of the testsrc2, you get the black borders that he's expecting
[19:11:12] <Arifd> I don't know why it doesn't appear for testsrc2, but it may be due to the mechanics of the plugin.
[19:11:24] <Arifd> if you run his commands but with optzoom=1 it does in fact zoom in
[19:17:13] <durandal_1707> just tell him this
[19:17:22] <durandal_1707> he is clueless sometimes
[19:18:11] <Arifd> Okay. :)

[21:21:04] <hyrcanus> if i just had a tool for remastering old b/w films that would give me previews of all the scenes, and set gamma/contrast/brightness for each, quickly
[21:22:28] <hyrcanus> there's a tool for scene-splitting, and ffmpeg can generate snapshots.
[21:28:59] <Arifd> So you want a GUI to play with settings which then outputs an ffmpeg command?
[21:30:20] <Arifd> can you open ffplay in one thread, and then send commands to it from another?
[21:38:00] <hyrcanus> i imagine a big scrolly page of the movie, split into rows by  scenes, contrast/brightness/gamma sliders for each scene, with two or three preview images for each scene, both before and after applying the eq filter
[21:38:45] <hyrcanus> this would let you identify those too dark, or too-grey scenes, quickly adjust, then save to a ffmpeg script

[22:23:11] <Arifd> GREAT! I just wrote a program in Rust that dumps the compressed webcam image (jpg) to stdout, and i can pipe it into ffplay to see it :)
[22:23:33] <Arifd> but if I dump the raw (YUYV) data, ffplay is not happy. does anyone know why?
[22:24:24] <hyrcanus> without header info, how would ffplay know how to decode it
[22:24:53] <Arifd> hmm, do I have to add a header to every frame, or just add header info to ffplay?
[22:25:22] <hyrcanus> all i know is that, as a rule, you have to tell a decoder what format your raw data is in
[22:25:38] <Arifd> yeah, i thought ffplay can figure it out though (it figures out jpeg just fine)
[22:25:42] <Arifd> i'll have a play
[22:25:50] <hyrcanus> jpeg has header
[22:28:02] <Arifd> thanks for pointing me in the right direction. I have to tell ffplay what it is
[22:28:15] <Arifd> im close, i can almost see myself (lots of green bars) I have to play with the pix_fmts
[22:36:00] <furq> if it's raw yuv you could wrap it in y4m

[22:42:56] <Arifd> nice thank you. If i can get away without wrapping it, i will
[22:46:15] <furq> it's less effort in the long run to wrap it
[22:46:15] <furq> otherwise you always need to set the framerate, image size and pixel format in ffmpeg/ffplay/whatever

[23:00:43] <Arifd> so I want to take my webcam input, do some image processing in Rust, then send it out to ffplay to see it.
[23:02:06] <Arifd> Am I supposed to wrap every frame of the image in the wrapper, or once, like a setup?
[23:02:16] <Arifd> because if i do it in my hot loop, seems dumb
[23:02:23] <Arifd> i'd rather just call ffplay with the correct args
[23:03:10] <furq> you just need FRAME\n before every frame

[23:10:45] <Arifd> Oh, so send the header once, then in my hot loop prepend FRAME\n to every stdout write?

[23:28:43] <Arifd> so if I want to do NO color transformations, just manipulate pixels, the number of planes, is a grouping of one pixel, is that correct?

[23:30:35] <Arifd> so for example I think YUYV422 has 4 planes. that means if I split the array into 4 chunks, and know the width and height, I can do simple math, like cropping for example?

[23:35:35] <furq> yuyv is packed, not planar

[23:43:17] <Arifd> RGB packed = RGB,RGB,RGB,etc. ?
[23:43:58] <Arifd> RGB planar = R,R,R,etc.G,G,G,etc.B,B,B,etc. ?
[23:44:47] <JEEB> and then you have half-packed like NV12, where you have Y in one plane, then packed Cb,Cr in another
[23:45:14] <DeHackEd> also the planer version usually has an array of planes with each in a separate array element
[23:45:27] <DeHackEd> though this may be just a representational thing
[23:46:20] <JEEB> but yes you cannot expect all planes to be in a single, continuous buffer
[23:46:46] <Arifd> I looked at the FFmpeg code a little, but not a lot. is there some internal datastructure that all formats are converted to so that filters can use the same API, or does each filter have to manage each format?
[23:47:15] <JEEB> that's why filters advertise which pixel formats they can habla
[23:47:22] <JEEB> or overall in the FFmpeg libraries

[23:48:06] <Arifd> hmm this is harder than I thought
[23:48:32] <Arifd> is a "crop" filter the easiest filter i can build to understand pixel formats?
