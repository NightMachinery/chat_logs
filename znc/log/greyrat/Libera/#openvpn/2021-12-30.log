[04:26:41] <crompyfoo4> I have a head scratcher. I have a openvpn running on a firewall connecting to a VPN service and the tunnel will randomly drop.Â  It could drop while there is data currently moving over the tunnel or when its quiet.Â  Using tcpdump I can see the keepalive packets every 10 seconds when there is no data moving over the tunnel. This has happened over
[04:26:42] <crompyfoo4> many different VPN services so it must be a config issue on my end.Â  I thought maybe it might be a firewall states issue but then I wonder how could the firewall drop the state while I'm actively moving data over the tunnel.Â  I'm lost
[04:28:03] <xx> crompyfoo4: any logs?
[04:28:33] <xx> I've seen these things happen sometimes when people wanted to connect from two separate devices using the same config files (and certs/keys)
[04:28:51] <xx> and they totally forgot that they also had openvpn running on their phone/tablet
[04:31:15] <crompyfoo4> Its always the inactivity timeout log. Which doesn't make sense to me since I'm actively using the tunnel
[04:31:17] <crompyfoo4> Sat DecÂ  4 03:05:45 2021 us=446129 [Hidden IP] Inactivity timeout (--ping-restart), restarting
[04:31:32] <crompyfoo4> I can provide more log if needed but thats the only thing that stands out
[04:32:09] <crompyfoo4> I've read lots about the double config issue too.Â  I suppose that COULD be the issue but the VPN provider allows a number of logins at the same time
[04:33:17] <xx> is it udp or tcp?
[04:33:23] <crompyfoo4> UDP
[04:33:46] <crompyfoo4> i'm waiting for it too fail again while I watch the firewall states
[04:33:56] <crompyfoo4> to see if there is an issue there
[04:39:14] <crompyfoo4> I thought that maybe my firewall rules on the tun interface itself was blocking any of the keepalive pings but apparently those don't show up on the tun interface, only on the physical external interface were i do see the pings every 10 seconds if there is no other data moving
[04:39:52] <crompyfoo4> I am on freebsd using the PF firewall if that matters
[04:40:49] <xx> well 'Inactivity timeout (--ping-restart), restarting' is pretty clear
[04:40:59] <xx> so you need to find out what causes that to be blocked at some point
[04:44:35] <crompyfoo4> yes I do agree.The connection will drop for whatever reason and THEN I get the inactivity timeout roughly 60 seconds later.Â  So it seems openvpn is functioning correctly.Â  Thats why I was wondering about firewall states, which I'm still looking into

[12:02:38] <UncleKiwi> hello - i have been doing a bit of testing with openvpn on my andoid and have been impressed by all except the way it seems to demolish my battery 
[12:02:54] <UncleKiwi> is there any way to reduced this demolishment

[12:29:04] <UncleKiwi> if I create two VPN servers can I make there be a priority ie always use v1.domain.com and only connect to v2.domain.com if v1 is offline - then to switch back when v1 is online again
[12:29:40] <UncleKiwi> I could make it less atuomatic and just have the ttl for the A record set for like 5min 
[12:29:57] <UncleKiwi> then change the Arecord to the backup in the event of an outage
[12:30:12] <UncleKiwi> just curious of ur views
