[01:17:26] <karthink[m]> What is a good way to map over a structure like this? (def vofv [[1 2] [3 4] [5 6]])
[01:17:27] <karthink[m]> I want to transform each entry and not lose the structure of the list: (map #(map inc %) vofv)
[01:18:36] <karthink[m]> For a depth of 2 this is ok but I often see a depth of 3 or 4 (e.g. tensors)
[01:23:05] <Para> mapv
[01:23:20] <Para> Which is pretty much same as (into [] (map ...))
[01:23:39] <Para> And beyond that, you need some kind of recursive function for the mapping.
[01:24:26] <karthink[m]> I was wondering if there's a function or macro like that in the standard library
[01:26:04] <karthink[m]> (map (fn [d1] (map (fn [d2] ... is hard to understand
[01:26:44] <karthink[m]> Basically something that walks through a tree and applies a fn to each element
[01:28:37] <Para> Well, there's the whole clojure.walk namespace if you want to go that route :)
[01:29:06] <Para> https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.walk
[01:29:54] <Para> Note how you in fact asked an entirely different question after the initial one. :)
[01:33:40] <karthink[m]> Are the two questions unconnected?
[01:35:15] <karthink[m]> Ah, clojure.walk does exactly that. Thanks
[01:36:16] <karthink[m]> Wouldn't the first example be handled by (walk inc identity vofv)?

[14:36:58] <Solid> selfsymmetric-mu: I don't think it's lazyness; compiling with Strict and StrictData does not change the result that much
[14:38:31] <Solid> Looking at the core when compiling with -O0 (this takes about 3 seconds; so it's much slower than -O2's 400ms, but also still faster than Clojure's 9-10s) there's not any magic there http://ix.io/3I7t/haskell
[14:39:45] <Solid> -O2's core is much more verbose, but apart from unpacking and cleverly unrolling some steps (at least that's what I took from it---I'm far from an expert in reading core) I can't see any "this only works in Haskell" optimisations
[14:41:38] <Solid> I suppose the `(defn go [args] ... (map (go new-args) xs))` idiom is just not one that the JVM can optimise very well?
[14:42:27] <Solid> What would be the idiomatic Clojure way of writing something like that (even giving up some declarativeness, if necessary :/)?
[15:05:33] <ridcully> i can share mine - it's loop/recur and does a BFS with a queue (like wikipedia suggested).  and a defprotocol for the two constraints.  i'd not say, that it's great, but it runs here with 1.2s.  so let me know

[20:58:21] <Solid> now that I need to look a little bit closer at certain aspects of the language, what book/resource would be good for someone "just starting out"? (I already have experience with FP)

[21:55:23] <manicennui> Solaris is still a thing.
[21:59:56] <neirac> manicennui illumos is what opensolaris was, the joyent public cloud was run using illumos (SmartOS)
[22:00:43] <manicennui> Sure, but I mean Oracle still sells support for their own version of Solaris and does some minimal amount of development.
[22:01:11] <manicennui> I imagine it is only used by people who have old Sun servers and can't easily move away from them.
[22:01:19] <manicennui> And insist on Oracle support.
[22:02:23] <neirac> manicennui oh no, it runs on x64 has bhyve and kvm for virtualization, is a nice platform , illumos does not have oracle support as is not solaris is the openbits from solaris.
[22:03:25] <neirac> is it possible to only pass keys as fn paremeters? I tried  (fn {:a :b :c}) but complains as is does not have even number of forms, something like that

[22:26:06] <tatsumaru> Really nice essay on paradigm lock by Paul Graham: http://paulgraham.com/identity.html
[22:32:03] <Para> I guess Paul Graham is Silicon Valley's Uncle Bob.
[22:34:07] <Solid> but no language truly has a paradigm lock, do they?  it's just a matter of how annoying the other way is to use :)
