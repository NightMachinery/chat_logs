[02:18:50] <Nothing4You> kevr: peripherals that are not connected?
[02:19:00] <kevr> but your keyboard is connected
[02:19:02] <mingdao> Nothing4You: Sounds like you're missing modules that you need.
[02:19:04] <Nothing4You> not in the vm
[02:19:17] <kevr> it is clearly hardware specific
[02:19:20] <kevr> but
[02:19:20] <Nothing4You> mingdao: no i mean it's working with usbhid.ko being the only hid match
[02:19:29] <kevr> they should fix that edge case that's clearly busted here

[02:20:03] <Nothing4You> does this mean xhci_hcd is the module?
[02:20:08] <Nothing4You> or is that in another line?
[02:20:12] <mingdao> xhci_hcd is for USB3.0
[02:20:18] <mingdao> Not exactly low speed.
[02:20:32] *** Joins: sogens (~gruntspla@gateway/vpn/pia/gruntsplatter)
[02:21:00] <Nothing4You> this one is going through front panel headers, let me check the one directly on the board
[02:21:02] <kevr> xhci_hcd is for the usb controller, not specific devices plugged into it

[02:22:42] <Nothing4You> i'd assume the module should already be loaded at this point anyways, so it probably wouldn't log that anymore?
[02:22:51] <Nothing4You> or would it still do that?
[02:23:02] <mingdao> Nothing4You: My Logitech kbds use more than just usbhid.
[02:23:03] <mingdao> mingdao@workstation ~/Cisco $ lsmod|grep usbhid

[02:24:34] <Nothing4You> i have both the logitech keyboard (g910) and the dell keyboard connected and the only hid modules loaded are mac_hid and usbhid

[02:25:53] <sheep> usbhid should be sufficient for a ducky one
[02:26:01] <sheep> and most usb keyboards
[02:26:20] <Nothing4You> yeah i mean both keyboards are working right now

[02:28:58] <Nothing4You> yes, when i built the initcpio with autodetect from the physical host it works
[02:29:10] <mingdao> Yes, that figures.
[02:29:13] <Nothing4You> when i build it on the vm (same disk) it strips something that is needed
[02:29:20] <mingdao> You could also try the fallback image from your bootloader, as it is not filtered by autodetect.
[02:29:33] <mingdao> initramfs-linux-fallback.img
[02:29:57] <Nothing4You> i'm assuming it won't break again, i primarily used this as a rescue environment
[02:30:08] <Nothing4You> so future generations will be running on the host directly again

[07:57:55] <sheep> the main initramfs-linux.img uses the mkinitcpio autodetect hook to remove modules that it thinks aren't necessary to boot. Usually it doesn't remove modules that you need, but sometimes it does, and you may need to use the fallback initramfs to boot if you change your hardware

[15:39:41] <joe_colben> Hi, sometimes it is possible to exit suspend (S3) with pressing key on keyboard, sometimes it is possible only by pressing the power button. Anybody knows how can I analyze this behaviour? I also had a problem which i mostly sorted by disabling usb wakeup events in /proc/acpi/wakeup. But for example when I plug AC, system will also exit suspend and I don't see any more stuff which can be disabled in /proc/acpi/wakeup for S3 except powerbutton

[18:28:08] <lunario_> hi. i recently tried to change my luks passphrase of my encrypted system. since then i have to enter my key 2 times upon boot. i checked the keys used by luks with luksdump and it says that both slot 0 and slot 1 are enabled. can somebody please confirm that this is the reason for the 2 password prompts? (just so that i dont remove anything that should be there)
[18:28:27] <lunario_> i.e., does a normal full-disk encrypted system use just one key slot, as I assume?

[18:35:33] <tirnanog> any key slot can be used to unlock a luks volume. having more than one populated slot wouldn't, by itself, be a reason to prompt twice for a single volume.
[18:37:05] <lunario_> ok, then i guess i will have to look for another reason why it requests the pw two times
[18:37:12] <earnestly> I used a binary file as a key for luks volume once, it's gpg encrypted as well so it gets passed via --key-file -.  I can't add a new key using this method because it doesn't seem to find anything on stdin

[19:36:57] <nilshi> I am playing Factorio through Steam on a second X Server/TTY and the game stops working when I switch back to X on TTY1. This is already in the load screen but also when hosting a multiplayer game. If I just minimze the game it keeps on working. I wrote a small python program that counts up and that keeps working when I switch TTY. So it specific to steam or factorio itself. Does that ring a
[19:36:59] <nilshi> bell? Any way I can trick the program to think everything is normal?

[19:49:02] <kevr> when you boot your computer up
[19:49:03] <kevr> what happens
[19:49:52] <kevr> if i were you, i would just launch up an arch iso, so that you can inspect your drives from a linux perspective.
[19:50:04] <kevr> your drives may have changed their dev identifiers if you changed where they were plugged in.
[19:50:06] <Archdemon> well it boots to windows fine but when i try to boot to my linux install it fails because it cant find the device and when i manually edit to change disks it still doesnt boot and im sure its because im probably putting in something wrong
[19:50:29] <kevr> launch up the arch iso
[19:50:46] <kevr> mount your drives as you did during the install, and arch-chroot into the root mount
[19:50:46] <Archdemon> well funny thing is that i have an older arch install on another drive and it boots fine so there could be some conflict
[19:51:10] <kevr> alright, hold the fuck up
[19:51:14] <kevr> let me just say off the bat
[19:51:25] <kevr> we should be trying to reduce the amount of factors in this equation
[19:51:36] *** Joins: samgranieri (~samgranie@user/samgranieri)
[19:51:42] <kevr> if you have _another_ arch install, it doesn't really matter.
[19:51:59] <kevr> what matters is your problematic install at this point and how we would restore your booting to it
[19:52:02] <kevr> yes?

[19:56:53] <kevr> i suppose, technically
[19:56:54] <Archdemon> also thought the gpu was going bad so i went to a friends with the same mobo and cpu and it did the same thing in his
[19:57:08] <kevr> the mobo and psu both being bad could allow the psu to overvolt your cpu too much, maybe there was some sort of voltage spike
[19:57:21] <kevr> really though, we can't find out now :)
[19:57:24] <Archdemon> its possible

[21:24:51] <archdemon> cryptsetup open /dev/nvme1n1p2 root is what i used but im not sure thats right 
[21:25:22] <kevr> archdemon: so, this is how it works in general; when you run `cryptsetup open /your/raw/device dmname`, it opens an unencrypted "tunnel" to /your/raw/device which is specified by `dmname`. Once you've done that, it should  be available at `/dev/mapper/dmname`
[21:25:29] <kevr> so, with your command
[21:25:38] <kevr> `/dev/mapper/root` is going to be your opened version of `/dev/nmvme1n1p2`

[23:48:49] <kevr> gpu prices got absolutely fucked the last year
[23:49:09] <bloodfart69> How you know all of this? What's your secret
[23:49:16] *** Joins: tzlil2 (~tzlil@user/tzlil)
[23:49:26] <kevr> yeah, so if you sell two, you can probably get like 800-1k, which would give you enough to get a newer than 5x0 series cards

[23:51:04] <kevr> bloodfart69: big tip for you, if you're going to buy a used gpu, buy one locally and have the person show you that it works before you pay.
[23:51:19] <kevr> and get furmarks on it
[23:51:53] <bloodfart69> Damn. Well, Dark souls has trained me well on the arts of suffering. I usually perfer new out of the box, but covid has been brutal.

[23:55:40] <bloodfart69> I didn't even know that. I am literally lacking in a lot of knowledge in a way. Probably didn't even bother to search around those specific areas. I've been so busy rebuilding my system. I skipped a shit-ton of steps. Money is tight, and would still look into a new card. But for right now, I'll do the multi-thread mGPU sdk/vulkan and just play with mods
