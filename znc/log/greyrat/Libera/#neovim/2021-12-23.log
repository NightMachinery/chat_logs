[08:28:06] <amosbird> Hello! How can I use my local clangd ser
[08:28:09] <amosbird> server,  https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/issues
[08:28:20] <amosbird> The downloaded version doesn't work for me
[08:30:09] <mjlbach[m]> What downloaded version?
[08:30:25] <mjlbach[m]> lspconfig just calls "clangd" in a spawned process, by default it will use whatever is first on your path
[08:31:01] <mjlbach[m]> you can also override `cmd` to be a table where the first entry is the absolute path to the executable, copy the subsequent entries from the default `cmd`
[08:32:43] <amosbird> mjlbach[m]: hmm, how can I override the cmd?
[08:33:01] <mjlbach[m]> I would read `:help lspconfig`
[08:33:19] <mjlbach[m]> cmd is one of many parameters you can pass into `setup { } `
[08:34:28] <mjlbach[m]> It's probably simpler to just make sure the clangd you want is first in your path

[17:49:19] <dundargoc> For OG vim it doesn't get better than user manuals. For neovim specific stuff it's harder ro give a definitive answer. First section of lua.txt (the one that isn't a reference) is nice. Nanotees lua guide is a good option

[17:59:33] <ii14[m]> lua manual or guides won't explain to you the different vim mechanisms, probably just how to translate vim script to lua
[17:59:50] <ii14[m]> also you still have to do some stuff in vim script
[18:00:09] <ii14[m]> and that's what you're using on the command line
[18:01:17] <ii14[m]> there is no point in writing `:lua print(vim.inspect(vim.g.some_variable))` when you can just `:echo g:some_variable`
[18:02:18] <dundargoc> The "Learn VS the hard way" feels a bit all over the place. I think the user manuals are better structured and more complete.
[18:03:49] <dundargoc> I feel like the user manuals also have a better separation between the useful parts of vimscript and the "here be dragons" part (`usr_41.txt`). The Learn VS feels like it matches both interchangibly which I'm not a fan of.
[18:04:27] <dundargoc> My vote goes to user manuals, but both are probably good choices.
[18:05:20] <alex1> Alright, so basically start with `:help`, skip the sections with content that's too familiar, and then proceed linearly, maybe taking a short detour to peruse lua.txt?

[18:09:42] <dumbdemic[m]> <alex1> "The learning path isn't clear to..." <- Might depend on your learning style but I find starting with minimal `init.lua` and learning based on what you need makes learning more practical than formal which imo is more fun.

[18:10:53] <ii14[m]> one things with reading manuals, is that it's sometimes good to go over the sections you already know too, because you can find out some small things and "tricks" you didn't knew about. but maybe you don't have time to do that

[18:24:37] <alex1> ah nice, I need to make some notes
[18:24:41] <ii14[m]> regex stuff in `:h pattern-overview`
[18:24:50] <sunjonSenghanBri> shtaaaap
[18:25:13] <sunjonSenghanBri> there's helpgrep
[18:25:21] <sunjonSenghanBri> and the rest is well layed out and indexed
[18:25:32] <sunjonSenghanBri> pointing out random chapters is a bit useless
[18:25:45] <smolck> your move, ii14
[18:25:53] <sunjonSenghanBri> as are anki cards
[18:26:06] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's not a foreign alphabet you're learning
[18:26:42] <ii14[m]> I'm not pointing to random chapters, but to indexes of different stuff
[18:27:16] <ii14[m]> from these points you can jump deeper and get more detailed explanations
[18:27:33] <alex1> eh, respectfully disagree. Anki cards were a big help in initially helping me understand and get into vim. Shouldn't be the only approach, but definitely helps address the memory curve.
[18:28:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> but you're going to learn what?
[18:28:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> commands that you may never use?
[18:28:26] <sunjonSenghanBri> the foreign alphabet metaphor was apt
[18:28:31] <sunjonSenghanBri> you can't dodge any letters/sections
[18:28:52] <sunjonSenghanBri> with vim, it's going to be far better to tackle issues as you encounter them
[18:29:11] <alex1> `:h functions` and `:h events` seems like good content to commit to memory
[18:29:31] <sunjonSenghanBri> if lua's your focus, start a small project. Copy a plugin for the sake of it. That'll generate real life scenarios 
[18:29:36] <alex1> I won't be encountering anything, because I'll be on a beach, far away from a computer.
[18:29:39] <sunjonSenghanBri> again
[18:29:48] <sunjonSenghanBri> no need to remember random section titles
[18:30:03] <sunjonSenghanBri> there's :h reference_toc
[18:30:23] <sunjonSenghanBri> that lists the sections and their descriptions exhaustively
[18:30:35] <alex1> Anyway, thanks everyone for the links and the input. I'll try to combine all the aforementioned as best I can in my quest to level up over the holidays.
[18:32:08] <ii14[m]> alex1: I don't know if to memory necessarily. I don't remember all of the stuff from functions, because it's hundreds of them

[18:37:40] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's a personal fave here too.
[18:38:36] <dundargoc> Yup, me too. On windows you can just type `:hardcopy` but on linux you need `postscript` installed. Maybe it was `ghostscript`. Also maybe it was on mac and not linux. 
[18:39:19] <alex1> I'd prefer to use https://fennel-lang.org/ over plain Lua. I suppose that should only come after getting a good grip on Lua?
[18:40:49] <dundargoc> Probably.
