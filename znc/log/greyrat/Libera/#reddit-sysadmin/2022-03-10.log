[00:06:28] <monr0e> п...ки is quite literally a self-censor. On its own it could be roughly translated to "fuck", although that isn't a direct analogue. In the context of that sentence, it has the same kind of meaning as "coward", only in the profane. Thus, "pussy" is the more meaningful translation. It should also be noted that it is something of a slur, in that context - much like the temr "pussy" in this.

[11:41:04] <kerat58> Dowd:  You can't be expected to know everything about every decision the MSP does, but if they document the main parts, should there be a problem later on, another MSP might be able to do the detective work.
[11:42:37] <kerat58> Example:  There is a RADIUS server, it runs on [xyz] physical server as of [date].   We should also know the primary IPs of each server
[11:43:45] <kerat58> Even something basic like that is infinitely helpful.  I've been thrown into situations of  :  "Well we have Asterisk somewhere around here.  I heard it runs in that old server up in the crawl-space on the 3rd floor.  Or wait, was it that old 486 that is under the secretary's desk that we were told to not unplug under any circumstances...Meh, dunno, there is PROBABLY an Asterisk box 
[11:43:45] <kerat58> around here somewhere though"
[11:44:41] <kerat58> Yes, that's an actual story, and I ended up having to go around box to box in various floors and rooms when business was closed for the day, unplugging the ETH cable, waiting sevceral seconds and seeing if we still have phones
[11:44:48] <kerat58> It was not EITHER of those two suggested servers BTW
[11:45:12] <kerat58> Once I unplugged the LAN from some random server and realized we finally lost phones, now I knew where the Asterisk box was :)
[11:45:55] <sd> 06<D​owd> Yeah but thats MSP to MSP, my point is when you have an MSP do all the setup, then say like 1 month later, something goes wrong with RADIUS or some other server, in a typical fashion who would be the one to diagnose and fix it.

[11:46:19] <kerat58> That's where the 'M' part comes in :)  Managed
[11:46:33] <kerat58> That's part of the support contract / SLA that the business has with the MSP

[11:47:08] <kerat58> You'll slowly pick up this stuff over time too
[11:47:44] <kerat58> You can remain the main point of contact for people within the company, but you'll have a close relationshpi with the MSP staff.
[11:47:55] <sd> 06<D​owd> which I have no problem with, I just don't know whats a typical scope for an on-premise IT admin and a MSP. I am completely fine giving everything to the MSP and learning these things individually as I go, but I dont want to hear from my bosses that something mission critical is down and they are unhappy with the response time.

[12:40:31] <Oliber> use the windows certificate store, it's all builtin to the OS
[12:40:43] <interop_madness> C# has an API for keycontainers, but it seems the API assumes people only want to generate keypairs on the fly, never put existing ones in

[12:41:18] <interop_madness> (and if yes, how)

[12:43:47] <interop_madness> Not super knowledgeable, but it contains "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY"

[12:49:32] <interop_madness> assuming that if the server is compromised with a user who is allowed to access either the file or the certificate in the store via ACL, it's game over anyway
[12:50:59] <interop_madness> I mean obviously, from an admin standpoint it would be better in the cert store, because it's all in one location, can be updated via GPO etc
[12:51:17] <csws> yeah well DPAPI would be good for keeping it away from prying eyes since you can use the user creds to encrypt
[12:51:36] <interop_madness> yeah
[12:51:49] <Oliber> i don't know about DPAPI, but there is a lot of existing documentation/work around the builtin certificate store; you can store the cert in 3 different places- per user, per service or per computer
[12:52:20] <Oliber> if you want the app to be portable to other OSes, not relying on a builtin windows component does have advantages
[12:52:27] <csws> DPAPI is what they use for powershell securestrings
