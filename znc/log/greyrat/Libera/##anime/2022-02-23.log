[13:29:45] <JesseDesu> SO COLD
[13:30:13] <emmeka> that's above freezing.
[13:30:15] <JesseDesu> i know you canadians are laughing
[13:30:27] <JesseDesu> but this is unusual for SF
[13:30:38] <emmeka> JesseDesu celsius lesson: 0¬∞C is the freezing point of water.
[13:30:52] <emmeka> any temperature in positive ¬∞C is in fact, not "freezing"

[13:32:55] <emmeka> JesseDesu once when I was in Florida in winter I went swimming in the Gulf, which ofc had water temps around like 50¬∞F at that time of year. That's a temperature normal for coldwater lakes in northern Canada in summer, though. But this one guy, he runs up to us *wearing a parka* and says "you kids better get out of there, you'll get hypothermia"
[13:32:56] <MootPoot> its already halfway throug the night

[13:35:09] <JesseDesu> in 30 years of using computers i've never had this happen until this year
[13:35:27] <emmeka> best thing was the time I was at a diner somewhere around the Florida-Georgia border and this waitress hears our accent, and says in thick drawl "y'all from Canada?!" and we're like uh, yes, and she gets this gleam in her eyes and again in deep drawl says all proudly "I saw snow once in Alabama!"

[13:40:03] <pokhu> anshupatia: try bakarina, a political thriller
[13:40:06] <JesseDesu> whats wet white and sticky and comes out of a ball under centrifical force

[13:41:05] <JesseDesu> are you over 18
[13:41:13] <emmeka> pokhu if you think about it, really, Villainness is like the antithesis as an anime to things like Death Note or Code Geass
[13:41:24] <JesseDesu> or want to be real soon
[13:41:34] <DunceCotus> so many crap animes 
[13:41:45] <JesseDesu> so many dunce cotuses

[13:42:13] <emmeka> anshupatia well, there's no shortage. So you like darker things with political intrigue, though? Given Steins;Gate etc.
[13:42:15] <DunceCotus> I liked Deatho Noto

[13:43:11] <anshupatia> I'm not exactly sure what you mean by political intrigue but yeah anything as dark as death note is great too

[13:43:44] <emmeka> I mean it's the most basic of basic recommendations
[13:43:51] <emmeka> but not on your list of otherwise basic series
[13:43:58] <JesseDesu> let me recommend you something
[13:44:05] <JesseDesu> its an anime mecha romance
[13:44:07] <anshupatia> I've seen some people watch attack on titan, not a big fan of giant titans though
[13:44:09] <JesseDesu> called eureka seven
[13:44:17] <emmeka> anshupatia well, it's not really about them.
[13:44:28] <JesseDesu> i read that as giant tits
[13:44:36] <JesseDesu> from far away

[13:45:25] <JesseDesu> we agree that much
[13:45:35] <JesseDesu> yes the world is fart
[13:45:43] <pokhu> anshupatia: bakarina had a famous prequel called bakatest, it might be better to start on that
[13:46:20] <JesseDesu> actually jupiter saturn ur anus and neptune probably smell like farts

[13:47:43] <Nanobot> I was writing an erotic story about a demon milf, and I needed to do some worldbuilding, so I invented a new food. Now I'm just hungry, and the food I want doesn't even exist.

[13:49:18] <pokhu> nanobot: worldbuilding food? could you describe it
[13:49:21] <DunceCotus> Attack on Titan was more unsettling in manga form
[13:49:33] <HubertFarnsworth> no shoujo or sol anime anshupatia?
[13:49:35] <DunceCotus> like something from Ito
[13:49:49] <anshupatia> also cowboy bebop and I like mecha gundam
[13:49:53] <emmeka> anshupatia but let's see... a list of action shounen series fairly dark in theme besides that, that I can recommend in good faith. First up let's try the two basic master class isekais, Moshoku Tensei or Re:Zero (you might as well *start* with those if you're going to watch isekai). Besides that.... Eighty Six, Assassination Classroom, Dr. Stone, Eden of the East, Demon Slayer, No Game No Life, Haruhi Suzumiya, Youjo Senki.
[13:49:59] <emmeka> in no particular order.
[13:50:05] <JesseDesu> i'm hoping for a nuclear exchange between US and Russia so i can end this stasis painlessly underneath the explosion of a 450 kiloton warhead
[13:50:14] <DunceCotus> Re: Zero gets so boring
[13:50:24] <emmeka> DunceCotus ?!
[13:50:25] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, cowboy bebop is good
[13:50:32] <emmeka> re:zero just gets to be like 5D chess
[13:50:37] <DunceCotus> Haruhi manages to not outstay its welcome, but there is the endless eight etc.
[13:50:40] <emmeka> which is only boring if you don't like searching for clues
[13:50:43] <anshupatia> emmeka: I'll check those anime out later

[13:51:00] <DunceCotus> emmeka: not caring about the characters is more the issue
[13:51:09] <Nanobot> pokhu: Well, it looks like a flaky pastry with a pressed rim. The outside is a bit salty and buttery, but it's fluffy below the surface and slightly sweet. But then the pastry has a rich steamy filling that's a bit like mutton soup but in a thick savory brown sauce.
[13:51:14] <DunceCotus> clues are great if you're invested in the characters/story
[13:51:28] <Nanobot> *mutton stew
[13:51:36] <amigojapan> mexen:a member of my team made the music
[13:51:41] <JesseDesu> the coolest scene in cowboy bebop is when he uses his gun like a retro rocket like in a space manned manuevering unit
[13:51:42] <emmeka> anshupatia but I would also recommend you broaden your horizons, your picks are all very I guess introductory anime, and you should be at the point of trying new things instead of trying to pick out more things that resemble the small number of genres you've tried.

[13:55:55] <DunceCotus> nor a North one
[13:56:00] <emmeka> sscout yeah but that's due to imperialism and the UK has now self-owned itself into obscurity
[13:56:01] <JesseDesu> for one, they probably have a body gaurd

[13:59:31] <HubertFarnsworth> it's an epic saga
[13:59:48] <JesseDesu> if you assume, that makes an ass out of u and me
[13:59:51] <emmeka> it's an epic saga that's sub-only and quite involved.
[13:59:54] <anshupatia> I watch subtitled anime, I don't know much of japanese
[14:00:17] <HubertFarnsworth> later

[16:18:15] <MootPoot> maybe, although they are delaying the launch until they have a full debian and full android 13 ( or 12 , dont remember ) stable build
[16:18:47] <amigojapan> \why would someone use android?
[16:19:09] <MootPoot> if they want to use it as a HTPC or something, or a driver for a smart TV
[16:19:11] <MootPoot> idk
[16:19:20] <MootPoot> but thats what they are officailly providing it with
[16:19:27] <MootPoot> armbian will probably come out with a build later
[16:19:41] <amigojapan> I see
[16:20:04] <amigojapan> MootPoot:if the price stayed at 5USD even later, I would get one
[16:20:12] <MootPoot> but in terms of power, its faster then most desktop computers from 2015 and before
[16:20:25] <MootPoot> even though it only eats 10w
[16:20:41] <MootPoot> might get even faster if we can overclock it with a fan

[16:21:20] <MootPoot> lol amigojapan dont be that cheap
[16:21:34] <MootPoot> its only 5usd to put in the preorder price
[16:21:45] <MootPoot> preorder, then you get the discount code that gives you 50 off
[16:21:48] <MootPoot> then you re-order
[16:21:54] <MootPoot> so minimum price is about ~100
[16:22:07] <amigojapan> MootPoot:tomako is closely watching what I spend
[16:22:16] <MootPoot> although now that the rpi is in short supply and this performs so much better this is the better choice really
[16:22:17] <darkwitch> amigojapan, I can see some typos even when you have the delete key :D
[16:22:39] <MootPoot> darkwitch: you should drink some coffee
[16:23:01] <amigojapan> MootPoot:better performance iws not the always a deciding factor, the rpi has a lot of comunity projects that you wont have on that
[16:23:08] <darkwitch> MootPoot, my stomach has been a bit unhappy recently, so I think not
[16:23:20] <amigojapan> darkwitch:lol I never said I would type perfectly
[16:23:27] <MootPoot> I know, but mostly all of those projects I just run in a VM on my server or run something similar like that in a VM amigojapan 
[16:23:46] <MootPoot> so for me I just need power

[16:24:10] <MootPoot> darkwitch: lactose intolerant?
[16:24:36] <darkwitch> MootPoot, no, too much acid or something
[16:24:38] <amigojapan> MootPoot:so called "IoT" projects too
[16:25:03] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I was planning on making the rock5 into a linux docker system 
[16:25:12] <MootPoot> the rpi isen't powerful enough to pull that off
[16:25:17] <MootPoot> smoothly at least
[16:25:35] <MootPoot> just two docker containers nearly max out the rpi 4
[16:25:43] <MootPoot> darkwitch: acid?
[16:25:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot:why not just do that on your server?
[16:26:13] <MootPoot> amigojapan: server is running near capacity
[16:26:26] <amigojapan> darkwitch: are you sleepy?
[16:26:26] <MootPoot> and also it uses a lot of power
[16:26:27] <darkwitch> MootPoot, I got a proton-pump inhibitor and it is helping
[16:26:47] <MootPoot> I had to google that

[16:27:29] <MootPoot> amigojapan: also the other thing is that docker containers are tied to cpu architectture, running x86 docker on ARM is really bad

[16:43:20] <darkwitch> it says the cabbage extract is useful as: Membrane repair ingredient - repairs damaged gastric mucosa
[16:43:45] <amigojapan> darkwitch:nice, it really works for me, but I take it every day
[16:44:13] <amigojapan> darkwitch: of course you can just eat cabbage, which is what I am lacking
[16:44:21] <MootPoot> amigojapan: hmm.....if the vegetables are fresh you can just bake them
[16:44:25] <MootPoot> baked cabbage is an option
[16:44:28] <darkwitch> some of the other ingredients works as an antacid (neutralizes the acid)
[16:44:53] <amigojapan> MootPoot:I could try that, no guarantee i will like it tho

[16:45:42] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I like cabbage rolls tho, so maybe
[16:45:59] <darkwitch> proton pump inhibitors are different in that they lower production of acid instead of neutralizing it, so it works for longer too
[16:46:31] <amigojapan> darkwitch:hmmm,, sound a bit scary tho
[16:46:53] <amigojapan> darkwitch:dont we need the acid to brake down food?
[16:47:37] <darkwitch> sure, but it's not like any of the drugs totally stop that
[16:47:53] <darkwitch> they just make it less nasty
[16:48:14] <darkwitch> so it doesn't also try to break down your stomach as well as the food

[16:53:10] <darkwitch> no
[16:53:15] <amigojapan> ah ok
[16:53:52] <amigojapan> darkwitch:by the way those Japanese coctails of drugs are very effective
[16:53:58] <amigojapan> especially for the cold
[16:54:22] <darkwitch> on the other hand it does contain sodium bicarbonate (aka baking soda)
