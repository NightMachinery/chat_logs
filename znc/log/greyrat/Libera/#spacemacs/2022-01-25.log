[01:39:51] <FromGitter> <Jeff-avatar> Terminal Emacs binds ESC key to be the meta key. This is very annoying when using terminal emacs. I would like the ESC key just used for switching from insert mode to normal mode, and use Atl key as the meta key. There is not so much useful info online. Anybody can help? Thanks.

[02:07:18] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> evil-search-next and evil-ex-search-next should provide similar behavior, in that (define-key evil-motion-state-map "k" 'evil-search-next) and (define-key evil-motion-state-map "k" 'evil-ex-search-next) should more or less provide the same results, no?  While fighting bug #15266, I realized that after removing the colemak package, setting evil-search-next to a key results in a binding that searches for 
[02:07:18] <FromGitter> ... the previously searched keyword (a word selected by pressing '*') in backwards order.  Can anyone else replicate this?
[02:11:18] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> You can find the state with `M-: evil-state`... pink is lisp state
[02:15:05] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Ah, thanks!
[02:15:37] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Do you know about `SPC s s`?
[02:16:40] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I think I usually use that... not sure how often I use `/` (I do, just I don't know how frequently)
[02:21:04] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> I was just reading about that in the documentation.  That does seem like a good option (although I do like ```/```).  I believe there is something broken with evil-search-next though.

[06:50:55] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Maybe I am unaware of how evil-search-next should work...I assumed it should be similar to evil-ex-search-next.
[06:51:28] <bdju> does the tab key makes spaces by default? I did a fresh install recently and the inconsistency of tab was confusing me. seems to differ based on the above line's word lengths or something

[16:16:21] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> @Oliver721: Do you have an ~/.emacs file, in addition to your ~/.emacs.d directory?
[17:39:42] <FromGitter> <rappie> hi, i'm new to spacemacs/emacs. i'm trying out layers & workspaces but i feel like i'm missing the point a bit because things dont work as i'd expect. first i created a new layout by opening a project with `SPC p l` and chosing a git directory. this works fine, i can now open files in the project with `SPC p f`. then i create a new workspace using `SPC l w 2`. now when i try to open files with `SPC p f` it says 
[17:39:42] <FromGitter> ... "You're not in a project". as workspaces are part of a layer, i'd expect to stay in the same project across workspaces. the name of the project is also still there in the left of the powerline. what am i missing here? :) thanks
[18:41:10] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I never used layout/workspace. My general suggestion to people is to buy an additional monitor if possible...

[20:56:03] <FromGitter> <thanhvg> workspace is one level bellow layout, it is tied to a layout but when you create a new workspace Spacemacs will  show you the default home buffer which doesn't belong to any layout, `spc tab` to go back to your previous buffer then those `spc p ` things will work
[21:01:13] <FromGitter> <thanhvg> I agree that layout/workspace are confusing, but they are amazing when working on multiple projects at the same time. However, even in that case you only need layouts most of the time.

[22:03:31] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I just have one dedicated Emacs frame for one project. And I manage the frames with my tiling window manager. Within each project, I use layout commands of Emacs. This avoids lots of confusions.
[22:09:03] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> "workspace" is very much overloaded. In LSP it's a synonym to (a projectile's) project. ‚èé And in general it's more related to a set of filea you are working on. ‚èé But we somehow made it related to layouts. This is counterintuitive in my opinion.

[23:20:48] <FromGitter> <rappie> `SPC TAB` indeed helps. so a project is tied to a buffer and not to a layer and/or workspace?
