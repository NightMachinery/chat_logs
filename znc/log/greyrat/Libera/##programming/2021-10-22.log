[00:49:32] <pyzozord> pulse: member the short discussion we had about optimization and Knuth?
[00:50:07] <pyzozord> Casey Muratori introduced me to a very neat word that descibes well what I think we meant "non-pesimization"
[00:50:18] <pyzozord> meaning "don't do the dumb things"
[00:50:29] <pyzozord> and "optimization" then means "do clever things"
[00:52:25] *** Joins: merijn (~merijn@83-160-49-249.ip.xs4all.nl)
[00:52:35] <pyzozord> in that sense "premature optimization is the root of all evil" makes perfect sense because it doesn't give a free ticket for "pesimization" (aka doing dumb things)
[00:53:59] <pyzozord> and I believe this is the proper way to take the Knuth's quote. "Don't be too clever too early". That is very different from "you can be dumb" which I think is how many people interpret the Knuth's quote

[04:46:50] <InPhase> Perl was absolutely spectacular for fast easily written text processing.  But Python provides easy writing of just about anything that's not too large.
[04:48:07] <oldlaptop> the particular thing that you're complaining about is almost certainly that they had the temerity to add something to the standard library, and someone else had the temerity to use it - insofar as that can be called a "weakness", it doesn't really apply to perl
[04:48:50] <InPhase> In perl it used to be something like, "Look how easily I can write a CSV parser and write some statistical analyses for this!"  In Python it's "I just load the csv and call the statistical analysis routines."

[08:07:45] <Jong> If a piece of code like an unnecessary copy happening every millisecond severely slows down a program, is it considered a bug? It's not crashing the program. The math isn't wrong. It's just an unneeded operation happening. Is it considered a bug?

[18:42:18] <[itchyjunk]> if you really wanted, you could look at part time programming job etc
[18:42:51] <chives> Thats where I feel like I guess I need to meet a recruiter because they can take all those things in to account and say you would probably be an ok fit here rather than me trying to force cookie cutter things in to something specific
[18:42:59] <[itchyjunk]> I am looking at some now and I am surprised how many of them wants you to move.
[18:43:13] <[itchyjunk]> they post with my area code etc, so they are targetting people here.
[18:43:22] <[itchyjunk]> But then they want people to move to different places.
[18:43:25] <pyzozord> merijn: if you are not using doing pointer arthmetic you are not programming. Real programmers only write microcode.
[18:43:29] <[itchyjunk]> Not sure what the stratigy behind that is
[18:43:36] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[18:43:43] <chives> thats another reason... because a lot of the cities are suspicious sounding to me
[18:43:56] <[itchyjunk]> chives, if i was a recruiter, i'd just put you in the spot that makes me the most money
[18:44:06] <pyzozord> merijn: using butterfly wings.
[18:44:34] <merijn> Most of the programmers bragging about that kinda thing barely even know what microcode is >.>
[18:44:55] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I didn't fully wrap my head around it until building a redstone computer.
[18:45:17] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Ben Eater's videos are good for that sort of stuff.
[18:45:25] <merijn> I don't think you can even have microcode in a redstone computer
[18:45:36] <Thedarkb-Desktop> You can't, that's the problem.
[18:45:52] <pyzozord> redstone as in in Minecraft?
[18:45:52] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I ended up having to have floors of combinational logic because it would've taken up too much space.
[18:45:55] <merijn> Unless your redstone computer is on a whole new level :p
[18:46:16] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I suggest building a Minecraft computer to everyone ;)
[18:46:21] <merijn> pyzozord: People have built entire x86 computer in minecraft, yes
[18:46:27] <Thedarkb-Desktop> What I don't suggest, is making it bit serial, because it's incredibly ball achingly slow.
[18:46:30] <pyzozord> I know, I love minecraft
[18:46:55] <pyzozord> minecraft is absolutely turing-complete
[18:46:55] <[itchyjunk]> Thedarkb-Desktop, so  you like physical construction of computers?
[18:46:56] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I was building it in survival on a friend's server with a few others and I was using shift registers for memory and had a bit serial ALU because it used less resources.
[18:47:02] <[itchyjunk]> so like FPGA kinda stuff too?
[18:47:09] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Never messed around with an FPGA>
[18:47:27] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: I mean, I wouldn't really call FPGA "physical" construction of computers

[20:09:34] <GeDaMo> If you tell frame to repaint itself, it will tell all its contained components (including your panel) to repaint themselves
[20:09:54] <[itchyjunk]> yes but `frame.repaint();` isn't doing anything

[20:39:28] <Jaran> you can see how the component only draws one rectangle based on the coordinates of the mouse
[20:40:09] <Jaran> that super.paintComponent() basically repaints the background of the component, thereby removing the previously drawn rectangle
[20:40:49] <Jaran> if you get that running instead of using a mouselistener you can use a timer and call that moveSquare() method based on coordinates you calculate

[20:51:14] <mawk> what's stopping you
[20:51:16] <mawk> yes mrig 
[20:51:18] <mawk> you can give a placement hint to mmap
[20:51:22] <mawk> it will give an error if it cannot honor it if the address is already used
[20:51:24] <mawk> but that shouldn't happen if you pick a specific address in the right range
[20:51:26] <mawk> why are you doing this though
[20:51:30] <mrig> GeDaMo: I'm not sure as I've never used mmap before, I think it is.
[20:51:32] <GeDaMo> [itchyjunk]: you can't loop continuously in paint, it will likely freeze the GUI

[21:56:18] <Psybur> So the language I am writing in (Carp) is licensed under Apache 2. My source code will be importing headers from the standard library. Does that mean I have to copy a notice if Carp provides one?
[21:56:19] <vdamewood> Psybur: Oh, the LGPL also has a notice-like requirement saying that if you give credit in your program at run time, you also have to give a specific notice along the lines of "Uses the foo Library, licensed under the LGPL blah."
[21:56:47] <vdamewood> Probably not, in that case.

[22:00:08] *** Joins: humky (~humky@user/humky)
[22:00:21] <merijn> Psybur: Because MIT/Apache/LGPL say "yes, you can distribute the binary derived result of these IFF you include notices"
[22:01:00] <merijn> So, yes, you have to include those notices in the binary you produce
[22:01:14] <vdamewood> There's also the distinction between documentation notices and runtime notices.
[22:01:37] <merijn> I mean, runtime notices are pretty trivial to fix, so easier to just do it
[22:01:39] <vdamewood> All the licenses require documentation notices. the LGPL has a runtime notice requirement if any runtime notices are given.
