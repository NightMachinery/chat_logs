[12:23:20] <yetoo> I am trying to replace the end of a string of a field with nothing. The end of the string would consist of = and any numerical number so (...=5). I have a basic test that just replaces =5 here:  echo $(printf "asd=5 >> textfile" |awk -F' ' ' {gsub(/=5/, "", $1); printf "%s %s", $1,$3}') How would I change the gsub command so target includes = as well as a range of 0-9 next to = (something like ...gsub(/=[0-9], "", $1)...)
[12:27:22] <yetoo> so it's just that [0-9], that solves it i guess, I tried to use :digits: or \\D(+) and it didn't work

[18:34:56] <jensen> How can I print only lines that don't have an empty second field? It is delimited by colon, e.g. it should print the first 5 lines for this data: http://ix.io/3Bnc
[18:35:37] <jensen> `awk -F ':' '$2 !=""' <file>` still prints every line
[18:36:46] <emanuele6> because there is a space after the colon in your input
[18:36:52] <emanuele6> so $2 will be " "
[18:37:25] <emanuele6> you could use: awk -F: '$2 !~ /^[[:space:]]*$/'
[18:38:03] <emanuele6> this will print only lines in which $2 is empty or blank
[18:38:16] <emanuele6> s/is/is not/
[18:40:19] <jensen> Thank you, I'm a smooth brainer
[18:42:03] <emanuele6> another option is: awk -F':[[:space:]]*' '$2 != ""'
[18:44:12] <emanuele6> this will make all the spaces that come after : part of the field separator and they will not get included in the field
[18:44:34] <emanuele6> s/spaces/whitespace characters/
[18:44:50] <jensen> That looks like the safer approach, I will do that
[18:45:11] <emanuele6> # printf 'a   : bc  d\n' | awk '{print "$ is "$2}'
[18:45:13] <shbot> emanuele6: $ is :
[18:45:18] <emanuele6> oops
[18:45:26] <emanuele6> # printf 'a   : bc  d\n' | awk -F':[[:space:]]*' '{print "$ is "$2}'
[18:45:28] <shbot> emanuele6: $ is bc  d
[18:45:39] <emanuele6> # printf 'a   :        bc  d\n' | awk -F':[[:space:]]*' '{print "$ is _"$2"_"}'
[18:45:41] <shbot> emanuele6: $ is _bc  d_
[18:46:07] <emanuele6> # printf 'a   :        bc  d:c\n' | awk -F':[[:space:]]*' '{print "$ is _"$2"_ and $3 is _"$3"_"}'
[18:46:09] <shbot> emanuele6: $ is _bc  d_ and $3 is _c_
[18:46:45] <emanuele6> # printf 'a   :        bc  d\n' | awk -F':[[:space:]]*' '{print "$1 is _"$1"_ and $2 is _"$2"_"}'
[18:46:46] <shbot> emanuele6: $1 is _a   _ and $2 is _bc  d_
[18:47:15] <emanuele6> if you use '[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*' $1 will be "a"
[18:47:24] <emanuele6> # printf 'a   :        bc  d\n' | awk -F'[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*' '{print "$1 is _"$1"_ and $2 is _"$2"_"}'
