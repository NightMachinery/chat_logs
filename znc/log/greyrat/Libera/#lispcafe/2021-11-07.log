[00:07:05] <selwyn> shka: did i understand right that you would like to see org mode implemented in common lisp?
[00:07:19] <shka> more of a wiki
[00:07:51] <selwyn> hm
[00:07:55] <shka> actually, something close to xanadu concept, with version control, cross-links and so one 
[00:08:07] <shka> as a note taking application
[00:08:15] <selwyn> xanadu is a very overloaded term for me :s
[00:08:27] <shka> but org syntax is ok 
[00:08:56] <shka> selwyn: Nelson's Xanadu
[00:09:00] <selwyn> had no idea about this xanadu
[00:09:15] <shka> Nelson of the computer lib/dream machines fame
[00:10:06] <gilberth> IIRC You would need real hyperlinks for that. That is links that go both ways and not just one way, like those with the WWW.
[00:10:19] <shka> yeah
[00:10:30] <shka> that's the idea 
[00:10:37] <gilberth> Sth I at times miss with the WWW.
[00:10:39] <selwyn> was the success of the www destined to be?
[00:10:52] <shka> wikipedia is a little bit like that honestly
[00:11:13] <shka> but i think it would make a great note taking application 
[00:11:21] <gilberth> selwyn: I would say, yes.
[00:11:42] <selwyn> there is a collaborative mathematics project that takes place almost entirely on wiki
[00:11:49] <gilberth> I mean, the internet before the WWW already had links.
[00:11:54] *** Joins: Jacobis9000 (~jonaholuf@host109-150-58-122.range109-150.btcentralplus.com)
[00:12:03] <Jacobis9000> hi
[00:12:06] <selwyn> hi
[00:12:17] <Jacobis9000> how's things selwyn?
[00:12:22] <selwyn> not bad
[00:12:25] <selwyn> relaxing saturday
[00:12:26] <shka> the problem with xanadu is that it was not universal
[00:12:37] <shka> it was trying to be what wiki is right now
[00:13:08] <gilberth> Are you talking about a concrete implementation?
[00:13:19] <shka> gilberth: about the concept
[00:13:27] <shka> xanadu was supposed to be a library/archive
[00:13:33] <shka> WWW is simply not that
[00:13:41] <gilberth> ok. I was curious, because I only know the concept.
[00:13:51] * Alfr thinks that org-mode like other such things I know, can't seem to represent following structure: (section some-text (subsection some-excursion) now-that-we-got-that-out-of-the-way-more-on-the-topic ..)
[00:14:11] <selwyn> collapse the subsection?
[00:14:17] <selwyn> oh, right
[00:14:18] <shka> and I do think that we missed out on a potential for a really good document system on the internet
[00:14:19] <selwyn> i see
[00:14:32] <shka> WWW/HTTP can do that, but not all that well honestly 
[00:14:47] <shka> and currently it is used more as a application platform
[00:14:48] <gilberth> Alfr: Even dead trees don't have that.
[00:15:10] <Alfr> selwyn, I see how that's totally going to fail in print, but still sometimes I like such a representation.
[00:15:32] <shka> so in summary, yeah, i think that Xanadu is something that could be revisited today 
[00:15:42] <shka> and wikipedia is the closest thing currently operational
[00:15:44] <gilberth> Alfr: Would make sense.
[00:16:17] <Alfr> gilberth, it feels more like, because dead trees don't have that I also don't have it in a fancy editor.
[00:16:46] <gilberth> What I would like to have is (1) universal back-links for the WWW and (2) A universal support for arbitrary annotation [without the cooperation of the site owner]
[00:17:23] <Jacobis9000> What, I make a site and you write all over it?
[00:17:27] <shka> i personally would want just a really good note taking application 
[00:17:30] <gilberth> Item (2) I once considered to do on a P2P basis, as this tech was still hot.
[00:18:00] <selwyn> gilberth: i see you have encountered the clim spec :)
[00:18:17] <Jacobis9000> I just take notes in a notebook
[00:18:22] <selwyn> shka: it seems there is a market for note taking apps/organisers
[00:18:24] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: Not over, but about. It's the client which then could show what others have written about what you have written.
[00:18:29] <selwyn> but org-mode has longevity
[00:18:30] <shka> selwyn: not that much 
[00:18:42] <selwyn> well, i see them advertised fairly frequently on youtube
[00:18:52] <shka> gilberth: p2p documentation archive is honestly not a stupid idea 
[00:19:01] <gilberth> Jacbis9000: And you could scribble into my hosting of the CLIM spec, if you wish.
[00:19:26] <Jacobis9000> What would be the advantage of this?
[00:19:58] <gilberth> Apart from the database part, which would be more hayley's domain, it could just be a plug-in or proxy, which puts references into the page, I currently browse.
[00:20:36] <Alfr> gilberth, how do you ensure that notes stay useful, i.e. the contents of a certain page doesn't change?
[00:20:47] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: The advantage is to link information.
[00:20:50] <Alfr> *don't
[00:21:02] <Jacobis9000> It sounds like a recipe for disaster, because most people are not trustworthy
[00:21:20] <Jacobis9000> Especially on the pseudonymous web
[00:21:52] <selwyn> would say the clim spec has not turned out too bad in that respect
[00:22:09] <gilberth> When the content changes too much, at a certain threshold, I would mark the comment as referring to an earlier version. The presentation would be entirely up to the client. That's the idea.
[00:22:44] <Jacobis9000> Maybe I am not following what is actually entailed here
[00:24:39] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: You browse some information and have a remark, a new reference to somewhere, some interesting related idea, say. You could publish in your blog today. But with my idea, you could put your remark, idea, critique into a shared database, so that when someone else browses that original page again, he could see what you wrote about it.
[00:24:59] <Alfr> After a while most notes in such a system would refer to earlier documents. Not a fan of people investing the time to read and respond on something only for the author to yank the piece because in the end he didn't like how it was received.
[00:25:22] <gilberth> And perhaps we would need spam filters, like with email. Or a reputation guess, like Google does it with search results. That's up to the client.
[00:25:55] <Jacobis9000> The Web is dross these days anyway
[00:26:15] <Jacobis9000> It's just marketing, constantly churning itself out
[00:26:18] <gilberth> Alfr: A lot of things stay quite static. News articles don't change, blog posting don't, technical specs don't.
[00:28:04] <gilberth> Anyhow, I still like that idea. I even have a name "Annototia". IMHO way more useful than the so called Metaverse.
[00:28:40] <selwyn> i'm impressed by how well the bbc managed to preserve old articles
[00:29:02] <gilberth> And there could also be non-shared private annotations. As with real paper, you could add marks on anything you use for reference or sth.
[00:29:36] <selwyn> perhaps they were traumatised by losing old doctor who episodes
[00:29:57] <gilberth> selwyn: spiegel.de (a news paper) was online early and essentially has every old news article online.
[00:30:50] <Jacobis9000> Well I guess your scribble over the net idea is ok
[00:30:56] <Jacobis9000> I think people would just take the piss
[00:31:46] <selwyn> i expect britain will try to ban anonymity soon
[00:31:51] <Jacobis9000> Look at the fascist bureaucracy that Wikipedia has to be just to keep things under wraps
[00:31:52] <selwyn> which will make the internet cringe anyway
[00:32:37] <gilberth> selwyn: This is a never ending war. Every now and then some German politician has the same brilliant idea.
[00:33:17] <selwyn> issue is that there is now no countervailing voice 
[00:33:18] <gilberth> There is a word for it: "Klarnamenzwang" :)
[00:34:03] <selwyn> the assumption is that we can solve every problem with racism, sexism etc. by simply handing over even power to big tech and expecting it to police everyone in a fair way
[00:34:07] <selwyn> this is not realistic
[00:34:17] <selwyn> *even more power
[00:34:19] <gilberth> selwyn: That bad? Well, when in doubt use UUCP. I read it's still in use in China for a reason.
[00:34:41] <selwyn> i am planning to spend much less time online, except to have fun on #lispcafe
[00:35:50] <gilberth> So now, if you wished to be anonymous here, could the authorities really prevent that?
[00:35:58] <selwyn> uh
[00:37:02] <selwyn> short answer no, but i don't know what the law will be in the future
[00:37:25] <Jacobis9000> we have a fundamental right to be known as any name we wish
[00:38:09] <Jacobis9000> the Government cannot force you to use the name on your birth certificate
[00:38:11] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: Tell that to old men with ballpens and fax machines.
[00:38:45] <selwyn> return to fax
[00:39:06] <gilberth> It's still is frequent use.
[00:39:15] <gilberth> * is in
[00:39:17] <Jacobis9000> Chopin's Nocturnes are incredible
[00:40:08] <Jacobis9000> I think I am going to listen to the 3 gymnopedies now though
[00:40:29] <gilberth> Anyhow, I get an allergic reaction, when politics wants to demolish civil rights for no good reason, as there can't be one.
[00:41:04] <shka> selwyn: regarding python and hasing
[00:41:07] <Jacobis9000> The left wing have always wanted to abolish civil liberties
[00:41:09] <shka> *hashing

[00:41:17] <gilberth> I am not anonymous here, but that is my personal choice. Everyone should be able to keep anonymous, if he wishes.
[00:41:47] <selwyn> shka: yes i see
[00:42:06] <shka> it is pretty annoying
[00:42:12] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: Not over here. Here it's the right wing.
[00:42:41] <selwyn> jacobis9000: get ready for the tories to pass legislation on this
[00:42:46] <selwyn> there is cross party consensus on this matter
[00:43:10] <shka> selwyn: it works only because hash collisions in such a small set are very unlikely 
[00:43:15] <shka> but still... uh
[00:43:31] <Jacobis9000> I don't think Boris will
[00:44:24] <White_Flame> left wing & right wing are both interested in abolishing different subsets of civil liberties
[00:44:34] <gilberth> selwyn: Curious, what is the justification his time?
[00:44:58] <selwyn> well, a dark subject
[00:45:24] <gilberth> "Think of the children!"?
[00:45:26] <selwyn> mostly 1) the murder of an mp and 2) the rape/murder of a woman by a serving police officer
[00:46:14] <selwyn> so there is a heavy atmosphere recently
[00:46:34] <gilberth> That little is the cause?
[00:46:48] <White_Flame> media & outrage mechanics determine what's little and what isn't
[00:46:50] <selwyn> well
[00:47:35] <gilberth> White_Flame: Sure. But such crimes just happen, everywhere, all the time. Have and will.
[00:47:53] <selwyn> the real issues here are, how can people trust the police, and where is politics if mps are not safe
[00:48:07] <White_Flame> when it happens to/from people entrusted to power by society, then it is a bit bigger of a deal by nature
[00:48:09] <selwyn> but these are difficult issues to confront, which media has little appetite for
[00:48:30] <selwyn> so instead the answer is to crack down on online abuse
[00:48:53] <gilberth> selwyn: So when there is little trust in the police, giving even more power to the authorities is the answer? I must be missing something.
[00:49:02] <White_Flame> all sorts of politicians & lobbyists have their crackdowns they're desiring, and jump at any flash issue like this to push it through
[00:49:09] <selwyn> problem: anonymity/online abuse were not particularly implicated in incidents 1) and 2) that i mentioned
[00:49:33] <gilberth> Of course not.
[00:49:36] <selwyn> gilberth: this is the british way :(((
[00:49:45] <White_Flame> s/british/political/
[00:50:13] <White_Flame> can't grab power as a pol without first granting the state the power

[00:50:25] -ixelp- Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance OST - Collective Consciousness Extended - YouTube
[00:51:16] <gilberth> Remember the school shootings? If it were by the propaganda here, evil murder-games like Counterstrike turn you into a murderer by just playing it. Does Quake count? Half-Life? I must be a very violent person. Curious, I have not noticed.
[00:51:22] <selwyn> at the moment, i am favouring a monolithic org-mode style where i keep nearly everything in one file
[00:51:28] <selwyn> but this doesn't have to last
[00:51:39] <Jacobis9000> It's actually the media that causes school shootings
[00:51:44] <Jacobis9000> the news
[00:51:47] <White_Flame> what?  no
[00:52:00] <White_Flame> well, you could say that it popularizes it, which might instigate copycats
[00:52:01] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: Are you brain-washed?
[00:52:08] <White_Flame> btu it's not the fundamental cause
[00:52:30] <White_Flame> 1) nutjobs just born that way, 2) cultural failings both empowering and disposing of people
[00:52:56] <Jacobis9000> the sensationalisation of these events imprint the events on more young minds
[00:53:14] <White_Flame> kids hate school, and the kids within
[00:53:22] <White_Flame> it doesn't take much to push a kid over the edge
[00:53:39] <White_Flame> especially as the school systems just treat the kids as nuisances instead of actually investing in them
[00:53:41] <selwyn> have heard that most of them are on disassociative drugs
[00:53:45] <Jacobis9000> if there were no reports of school shootings, I will bet you £100, there would be a dramatic decline in the number of school shootings
[00:53:49] <selwyn> which is why they can't weigh up consequences very well
[00:54:00] <White_Flame> selwyn: schools nowadays overprescribe meds in a bad way, for any deviation from perfection
[00:54:17] <White_Flame> I don't think there's going to be much correlation with the meds
[00:54:19] <gilberth> Neglect in school. Being harassed at school and nobody cares, having no perspective in life. That also are causes. To say that sth else is the prime cause, is just hypocritical.
[00:54:34] <White_Flame> and the school shootings iirc were a thing before the hypermedication of students
[00:54:41] <selwyn> ok
[00:54:50] <Jacobis9000> why are the French such good composers for piano?
[00:55:01] <gilberth> Especially if that are so easy answers like "computer games", or "the wrong music".
[00:55:13] <White_Flame> Jacobis9000: they are? :-P
[00:56:31] <White_Flame> gilberth: easy answers are what the media & politicians need to market themselves
[00:56:53] <White_Flame> which of course has nothing to do with reality, but a lot to do with mindshare
[00:57:38] <gilberth> White_Flame: Yep. And, I keep repeating myself, easy answers.

[00:58:32] <White_Flame> and of course with the extreme polarization becoming more extreme due to social media algorithmic influence, people have their own easy answer of "It's $OTHER_GROUP's fault for everything bad!"
[00:58:34] <Jacobis9000> Yes they are
[00:58:40] <Jacobis9000> sorry I am semi afk
[00:58:43] <gilberth> Just outlaw Counterstrike and we won't see school shootings anymore. Must work.
[00:58:46] <Jacobis9000> Smoking a spliff out my window
[00:58:49] <White_Flame> Jacobis9000: you mean classical or modern or what?
[00:59:00] <Jacobis9000> modern
[00:59:00] <White_Flame> most names that come up for me are germanic or polish
[00:59:03] <White_Flame> ah
[01:00:09] <White_Flame> gilberth: clearly since there's been 2 games recently again, you should be pointing to DOOM ;)
[01:01:02] <gilberth> The most hypocritical thing was, just after one major school shooting here some 20 year ago, a gamer's party (one of those where a few hundred come together and bring their hardware to play games) was de facto forbidden, while a weapons fair no 30km from the school in question, was ok.
[01:01:19] <White_Flame> of course
[01:01:37] <White_Flame> idiot reactionaries taking advantage of a situation to exert power
[01:01:46] <gilberth> White_Flame: id games are not legally available here. ;)
[01:01:51] <White_Flame> lol
[01:02:00] <gilberth> It's true.
[01:02:11] <White_Flame> because of nazi bad guys, or because of violence?
[01:02:25] <gilberth> Because of the former.
[01:02:27] <White_Flame> didn't know the whole company was banned
[01:02:46] <White_Flame> I knew individual games were
[01:02:57] <gilberth> Not exactly, but since then id software not even attempts to get their games cleared here.
[01:03:14] <White_Flame> I wonder if the persona/SMT games are banned there, too
[01:03:20] <White_Flame> ah
[01:03:59] <White_Flame> https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/0/00/HitlerBoss.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20170215164651
[01:04:05] <gilberth> There are a few games I smuggled from Danmark here in times as DVDs were still a thing. Helped to be in Danmark at least once a year.

[01:06:30] <gilberth> In late 80s and early 90s I also operated "illegal" modems.
[01:06:35] <White_Flame> heh
[01:07:07] <White_Flame> I know with anime, there had been some things that have become illegal even though they're not to any reasonable reading deserving of it
[01:07:15] <White_Flame> by umbrella laws & stupid definition
[01:07:52] <gilberth> Because of what? Being suspect to be child porn?
[01:07:55] <White_Flame> (while also certainly acknowledging that some other of that content certainly would violate other countries' laws)
[01:08:08] <White_Flame> yeah, or related closely enough to to it
[01:08:42] <White_Flame> I know there's also movies (non-anime) which have become retroactively illegal for all sorts of varying reasons
[01:08:46] <White_Flame> it's all crazy
[01:09:03] <White_Flame> I have a musical instrument that is probably illegal to own now, because of the wood it's made from
[01:09:19] <Jacobis9000> where are you from White_Flame?
[01:09:21] <White_Flame> not illegal to produce, but illegal to own
[01:09:23] <White_Flame> usa
[01:09:25] <gilberth> Sad thing is, I have the impression it gets more and not less crazy with time.
[01:09:28] <Jacobis9000> Biden?
[01:09:35] <White_Flame> huh?
[01:09:44] <White_Flame> yes, that is the president of the usa
[01:10:00] <White_Flame> gilberth: of course.  you only have to look at the incentive structure of legislators
[01:10:12] <Jacobis9000> Is he the source of any of this mad legislation?
[01:10:14] <White_Flame> there is zero incentive to actually pass good law, or to clean up existing bad law
[01:10:25] <White_Flame> Jacobis9000: I'm talking about stuff that's happened across the last 20+ years
[01:10:47] <Jacobis9000> Oh so Obama
[01:10:49] <gilberth> At times, I question myself: Why? What's the purpose? Is there an agenda?
[01:11:00] <White_Flame> personal agenda of career advancement
[01:11:12] <White_Flame> for the lobbyists, and for the politicians
[01:11:20] <White_Flame> and for those hiring the lobbyists
[01:11:44] <White_Flame> no overall agenda, just the composite of individual agendas that don't care about the fallout damage to the system of law
[01:12:03] <gilberth> What puzzles me, is that people still vote those guys. They either believe the stories told, are stupid, or don't care.
[01:12:10] <White_Flame> propaganda works
[01:12:20] <White_Flame> doesn't matter if 15% of the people don't fall for it, if 85% do
[01:12:28] <Jacobis9000> Most people don't understand anything. 
[01:12:43] <Jacobis9000> I've noticed that. 
[01:12:47] <White_Flame> people are in a constant state of information overload.  there's no time for depth into anything, just headlines & tik tok soundbites
[01:13:04] <White_Flame> people give articles something like 3 seconds each, if they "read" them
[01:13:10] <Jacobis9000> Well they understand THEIR things, maybe. But not wider things.
[01:13:37] <gilberth> White_Flame: So what do we do? There is no place we could escape to. It's everywhere. Although Germany still feels like a pretty liberal island.
[01:13:51] <White_Flame> Jacobis9000: people don't understand "their" things either, they just wave their polarized flag, cheer things under them (without understanding), and throw hate at those not under them (without understanding)
[01:14:12] <White_Flame> gilberth: all this stuff exists on pendulum swings
[01:14:19] <Jacobis9000> no I mean, for example, if someone is a Master thatcher, it doesn't mean he is a Master at politics
[01:14:42] <White_Flame> well yeah, understanding of their field is different than an understanding of broad issues
[01:14:57] <gilberth> White_Flame: The pendulum is going all this way for decades. When is the turning point?
[01:15:00] <White_Flame> and politics, by definition, is all about broad issues
[01:15:38] <White_Flame> gilberth: I view social health as a sawtooth wave.  There's degeneration downwards, then a big spike up in social revolution
[01:15:51] <White_Flame> and then complacency back into the downward trend
[01:16:50] <White_Flame> already there's a notion that facebook is a boomer's platform for dumb extremist pushing agendas, and rejecting that
[01:16:56] <White_Flame> from younger generations
[01:17:14] <White_Flame> (obv succeptible to other manipulations, but when things get bad they do get noticed in a groundswell)
[01:17:22] <gilberth> White_Flame: Ok then, when I look at our current teenager generation, I'll probably have to wait for the next generation after them.
[01:17:40] <Jacobis9000> Oh teenagers grow up don't worry
[01:17:55] <Jacobis9000> Even Socrates was saying of the youth how awful they are
[01:18:07] <White_Flame> some quote like "If you're young and are conservative, you have no heart.  If you're old and liberal, you have no brain"
[01:18:39] <White_Flame> "those youths are terrible" dates back to sumeria or earlier
[01:19:09] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: Sure, but the mindset of those <30yo is to value civil rights less than my generation. And when people grow up they usually become more conservative and/or authoritarian.
[01:19:27] <White_Flame> yep, because they don't have the exposure to lack of civil rights as prior generations had
[01:19:52] <White_Flame> so they don't understand why it'd be so bad to curtail "a little bit of free speech here & there" or whatever
[01:20:26] <White_Flame> also, child worship from parents makes for incapable, underdeveloped kids who cannot adult
[01:20:42] <White_Flame> which certainly is another long-swinging pendulum
[01:20:51] <gilberth> Don't get me started on that topic.
[01:20:54] <White_Flame> heh
[01:21:31] <gilberth> It's outright neglect of todays parents by my definition.
[01:21:39] <White_Flame> but the flip side is it's much easier for teenagers to stand way above their peers just by displaying simple competence ;)
[01:21:59] <White_Flame> gilberth: yep, but not just "today's parents" but for a few generations now
[01:22:14] <gilberth> Like what? Walking alone to school?
[01:22:25] <White_Flame> I mean entering the workforce, mostly
[01:22:45] <White_Flame> like actually showing up and doing something resembling work puts you in the 99th percentile :-P
[01:23:20] <Jacobis9000> I wish I could farm data and find out how many people have achieved the highest marks at intellectual history
[01:23:21] <gilberth> "Actually showing up" You're kidding.
[01:23:29] <Jacobis9000> and compare that to the general population
[01:26:43] * White_Flame is afk

[02:25:50] <selwyn> yeah he has a real vibe
[02:26:08] <selwyn> young michael rosen
[02:27:06] <selwyn> old english is generally not popular here
[02:27:19] <selwyn> i knew english students who had to do it, and they did not like it
[02:27:48] <gilberth> Heh, I don't have to, perhaps that's the difference.
[02:27:56] <selwyn> yeah
[02:28:18] <selwyn> my name has an uncertain etymology but it is somewhat likely that it comes from old english
[02:29:00] <gilberth> And this Old English still has gender. Easy to handle for a German :-p
[02:30:01] <gilberth> selwyn: My sister has the kewler name of both of us children, she is named Gwendolyn.
[02:30:20] <selwyn> i used to live on 'gwendolyn avenue'
[02:30:32] <gilberth> Anyhow, let me finish my meal and that video. bbl
[02:34:19] <sham1> I do sorta wonder why grammatical gender developed
[02:34:35] <selwyn> i read a good explanation at one point but forgot
[02:35:36] <sham1> At least from my very limited experience it only seems to be an Indo-European thing
[02:38:12] <selwyn> you can get gender in non indo european languages, as well as more exotic distinctions
[02:38:30] <selwyn> i.e. animate vs inanimate, edible vs inedible
[02:38:40] <sham1> That seems like a given, it'd be weird to have only developed once

[02:39:35] <selwyn> i found the book on languages that i read
[02:40:18] <hayley> gilberth: How about this: as well as optimistic stack allocation, we have the compiler do local lifetime analysis, and we reuse optimistically stack allocated memory iff the object has a compile-time local RC = 0 and it hasn't escaped?
[02:40:37] <selwyn> the german grammar system originated so long ago that we can't trace how it came about
[02:40:39] <hayley> The "compile-time local RC" would be the very hard part, admittedly.
[02:41:19] <selwyn> but it is plausible that it originated as a simple classification system that mutated 
[02:41:26] <gilberth> So, I learned Old English has gender and you could shuffle phrases within a sentence, there is no fixed order. Sounds like German. Easy.
[02:41:30] <selwyn> since this can be observed in contemporary languages
[02:41:35] <sham1> Or Latin

[02:42:06] <selwyn> book gives the example of an aboriginal australian languages that decided to put aeroplanes in the 'vegetable' gender
[02:42:22] <sham1> According to Wikipedia, the most reliable source, originally Proto-Indo-European might have had a split between animate and inanimate
[02:42:52] <selwyn> there are two genders: vegetable and non vegetable
[02:43:03] <gilberth> sham1: Danish has that.
[02:43:42] <gilberth> selwyn: Curious.
[02:44:27] <sham1> Swedish also has common and neuter
[02:46:22] <gilberth> selwyn: So you say, nobody knows where German syntax comes from? Or are you referring to the grammar as a whole?
[02:48:12] <sham1> But it is interesting how some language families had this stuff while others don't. Like for example the Uralic languages don't have grammatical gender, neither do Sino-Tibetian  from what I can tell, and also Japanese and Korean fit into this. It'd be interesting to maybe get some sense into why these groups didn't develop it while a lot of their neighbours did
[02:48:46] <pl> well, we might have issue tracking /germanic language family/ evolution (it's possible) but afaik what you find in textbooks as "german" would be somewhat conlangish design that happened in 19th century thanks to unification, AFAIK
[02:50:51] <hayley> .oO(Where is Henry Baker's email address when you need it?)
[02:51:03] <gilberth> sham1: How do we know, that it isn't lost? I mean it's almost lost in English.
[02:51:17] <sham1> Well could be also that
[02:54:07] <gilberth> My impression is that languages deteriorate. German is loosing its genitive with time. And the "e" suffix on nouns in the dative case is already almost gone. But then I have little exposure to different languages, and none outside the indo-germanic family.
[02:54:57] <semz> which raises the question how languages acquire features
[02:55:52] <semz> afaik this loss of features over time is nearly universal
[02:55:54] <gilberth> idk, all I see is languages loosing features.
[02:56:35] <gilberth> Read older German texts, you find grammar used, which although understood, is just out of use.
[02:57:12] <sham1> Well some languages seem to be gaining them, although they're not necessarily the European ones or so
[02:57:40] <gilberth> And we have only four cases left. Latin has more, Russian has more, and Lithuanian has more. Where is the rest?
[02:58:34] <pl> Polish has 7
[02:58:38] <pl> all in use
[02:58:46] <gilberth> The question I always ask me, given the complicated grammar of German, say, or Latin. Was this developed, or invented?
[02:59:09] <gilberth> pl: Yep, sorry, I forgot about Polish.
[02:59:44] <pl> gilberth: evolved then codified is the usual case, afaik
[03:01:32] <gilberth> Well, I ask because we have a bias. Common people won't leave texts for us to read. And written language is not necessarily the same as spoken language. And modern German was constructed in an attempt to unify all those existing dialects.
[03:02:39] <pl> gilberth: some languages have somehow survived less changed over time than others
[03:02:43] <gilberth> Not really constructed per se, but a common language was gathers. Like Common Lisp is the codification of a multitude of different Lisp dialects.
[03:03:12] <pl> I mean, germanic languages might be actually unusual in how much they fucked around and changed
[03:03:58] <gilberth> pl: Yes. And I learned that Lithuanian is pretty old compared to many other European languages and quite a bit different.
[03:04:29] <pl> With polish, the main issuee is lack of written polish of old, though the oldest record is 1) of peasants talking 2) grammar is familiar to modern ear but vocab heavily differs
[03:04:58] <pl> but then Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had Latin as official language till 17th century or so?
[03:05:27] <pl> (and not the kind of latin you learnt in "classical studies" by memorizing rules and reading Caesar)
[03:05:42] <gilberth> pl: Well, I have real trouble understanding Bavarian. And there is Low German, which qualifies as a different language and not just a dialect. Still in day to day use until the 60s, 70s. In fact it's the native language of my mother, standard German is her second language.

[03:07:00] <pl> gilberth: I spent few weeks in area where all natives speak Low German in addition to standard german, and this helps with the cross border exchange with the other low german area, netherlands ;)
[03:07:30] <gilberth> A Bavarian will definitely not get a word of Low German.
[03:08:09] <gilberth> pl: That kind of Low German in "Ostfriesland" near the Netherlands, I don't speak and can barely understand.
[03:09:11] <pl> gilberth: a lot of areas somewhat close to Berlin only started fully speaking german dialect shortly before unification, afaik
[03:09:38] <gilberth> The local Low German up towards the Danish border, I could understand almost perfectly, although my parents spoke standard German all the time. My father also was raised with standard German.
[03:10:20] <gilberth> It used to be a bit of a class thing, too.
[03:11:23] <gilberth> pl: Really? I wasn't aware.
[03:12:04] <pl> gilberth: german dialects arrived with settlers from today western areas and with upper classes that had german tutors
[03:12:22] <gilberth> Maybe it's a historical thing, as the idea that there is a German nation is pretty new, compared to the other European nations.
[03:13:08] <pl> I think I've read that Western Slavic languages died off only around 17xx in today's north-east germany
[03:13:49] <pl> and one of the demos for Clerk (a clojure "notebook" thing) plots presence of slavic languages by mapping surviving slavic place names
[03:14:29] <gilberth> The time frame would make sense. It's only since radio and TV essentially, that common people would start to use standard German.
[03:15:44] <gilberth> pl: I find place names interesting, because when looking at a map, you see a gradual shift in suffixes used for "town" which are not congruent with national borders.
[03:17:12] <gilberth> Each region has it's suffixes. You find a lot of "-büttel" and "-bühl" around here, further up north it's often "-by", like in Danmark. A gradient.
[03:18:21] <gilberth> You could see that with rivers, too.
[03:20:24] <gilberth> But it's probably everywhere the case unless you have a central power which outlaws local dialects. And modern media do level things out, too.
[03:21:34] <gilberth> It's a difference, if you watch national TV all the time, read national news papers, or you never leave your little village with little contact and being illiterate.

[04:08:09] <pl> hayley: yes, though it's recommended to compute your own (global mass reuse of known shitty values was core of logjam attack against TLS)
[04:08:32] <hayley> I want to compute them only when the server starts, which is how I did scrypt before.
[04:08:33] <pl> openssl has a command to prepare a file of them
[04:09:01] <pl> hayley: for high security, you precompute them per machinee
[04:09:10] <pl> you don't need to recalc them on each start

[04:12:44] <hayley> But I figured out why I didn't want to change to DH: it's just that I know KDFs pretty well, and I have to ask pl if doing so and so with DH is okay.
[04:13:11] <hayley> This is Java, but same difference. (Also why I don't want to do anything on short notice - can't test it, no magical type system, no test suite...)

[11:40:53] <hayley> One problem with the compile time refcounting stuff: we have to refcount values, but our IR consists of locations. With assignment and aliasing those are very different.
[11:43:43] <selwyn> kind of reluctant to backup personal things in the cloud

[11:45:21] <selwyn> that could work
[11:48:12] <shka> selwyn: i was expecting some remarks about quantum computing in this moment 
[11:49:13] <selwyn> oh right lol
[11:49:56] <shka> i have no idea how gpg and quantum mixes
[11:50:52] <selwyn> issue is that quantum computers can break certain algorithms, like rsa
[11:51:00] <selwyn> and looking at it, probably elgamal and others
[11:51:09] <shka> but not all
[11:51:12] <shka> right?
[11:51:15] <selwyn> well
[11:51:22] <selwyn> this is the challenge
[11:51:40] <selwyn> to invent cryptography that is resilient to quantum attacks
[11:52:12] <selwyn> which is a wip iiuc
[11:52:51] <selwyn> for example, there was hope for elliptic curve crypto, but it turns out that you can break that too
[11:54:24] <selwyn> i don't think that the nsa ever tried to build a large qc, but you can never be sure
[11:55:33] <hayley> Are you Shor of it?

[12:00:21] <shka> i thought that the archetypic of British engineering is PIAT 
[12:00:25] <shka> but ok
[12:00:45] <gilberth> hayley: Again. What I gather from the other benchmark you posted is that Rust runs the DFA mindlessly from each character position again, and thus doesn't implement our grep operator at all.
[12:01:04] <hayley> gilberth: Also perhaps that it interprets the DFA^WNFA too.
[12:02:09] <selwyn> an anti tank weapon?
[12:02:13] <shka> yes
[12:02:32] <shka> they took time to design very effective warhead
[12:02:38] <gilberth> hayley: So while we match in O(nm), n being the size of the input, m the number of equivalence classes which is bound, and thus in O(n), Rust does in O(n^2), despite advertising a DFA.
[12:02:57] <shka> and then they decided to hurl it on task using a giant spring
[12:03:15] <shka> which is, frankly, terrifying
[12:03:23] <hayley> gilberth: For ab|ac with the old OMRN compiler (which didn't use grep[], rather just backtracked) it was only about 1/2 the speed. Not 1/85.
[12:03:33] <gilberth> hayley: And then of course O(exp(n)) for running the NFA for submatch addressing.
[12:03:55] <selwyn> well i guess i meant the post war era, now i come to think about it
[12:03:59] <hayley> Brilliant.
[12:04:19] <gilberth> 1/85? And what's OWRN?
[12:04:31] <hayley> But I think the slowdown is due to interpretation mostly. Same for PCRE2 with and without JIT.
[12:04:36] <hayley> OMRN = one-more-re-nightmare
[12:04:50] <gilberth> Of course.
[12:04:53] <hayley> Rust is 85x slower at (aa|a)* [sic] than OMRN.
[12:06:36] <gilberth> I see. Well, I was curious because we get in big trouble for a(a|b){n} with our grep operator as we have O(2^n) states then. One "bit" essentially for every position, we might otherwise backup to.
[12:08:48] <hayley> Yeah, idk. Bailing to a reasonably well designed interpreter was one idea I had, though it only handles the Lisp compiler being slow, not having O(2^n) states. Or we could bail without grep[] and act dumb.
[12:09:17] <gilberth> I have not worked that out yet, but I image we could use a hybrid approach. Let a(a|b){n} use the grep operator for up to a small number of n we could feasible handle, say k. And then backtrack in chunks of k characters. I have the feeling that this must work, I just don't know how yet.
[12:09:38] * hayley nods
[12:10:44] <gilberth> What you would get is a hybrid NFA/DFA essentially. This calls for some interesting theory.
[12:11:20] <hayley> gilberth: FWIW I think they advertise either a DFA or NFA, using the DFA where possible but falling back to NFA if your RE sucks, or for submatching.

[12:12:23] <gilberth> Ok.
[12:13:18] <hayley> And my old compiler did generate a DFA, but naively scanned every position, rather than grep[] (assuming there was nothing for Boyer-Moore). O(n^2) is very different to O(2^n).
[12:14:09] <hayley> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT3cERVRoQo
[12:14:28] <hayley> So I don't think it's really a NFA, even if it's stupid.
[12:14:50] <gilberth> But in general you could always map you alphabet. You could either expand a character into it's bit sequence, our craft a new alphabet by grouping symbols. So instead of having \Sigma being [abc] say, you could transform that to match sth on \Sigma = [abc][abc]. Brain hurts; another time.
[12:16:23] <gilberth> hayley: In my book, a backtracking matcher still is not a "proper" DFA. But, yes, O(n^2) isn't that bad for most cases.
[12:16:27] * hayley needs a hobby research project that makes some money.
[12:18:08] <gilberth> A hobby research project? What should that be? And how would that make money? Can't you just bite the bullet and hack anything silly, stupid, and/or tedious for food?
[12:18:11] <hayley> Well, grep[] sort of backtracks if it goes NULLABLE, sheds the grep[] wrapper, then loses later (e.g. (ab)* scanning abababa). The scanner has to backtrack a tiny amount (back to the last a, rather than the position after it).
[12:20:12] <hayley> gilberth: Based on university classes, I fear I would lose brain cells doing that.
[12:20:28] <gilberth> Yep, but it doesn't really backtrack, all the information of possible alternate matches in codified in the state. This is what makes a(a|b){n} being O(n^2), as there are n^2 positions for a previous a(a|b){k}, k < n, seen.
[12:21:07] <gilberth> hayley: You don't need to take your brain with you. Leave it at home, where it's probably safe.
[12:21:29] * hayley wonders if anyone would notice if she doesn't fix A* not clearing registers.
[12:21:49] <hayley> Given that most RE engines are very broken and no one cares, I don't think anyone would.
[12:21:55] <gilberth> hayley: For high speed scanners, you usually want to avoid backtracking. Scanner generators usually could tell you, whether there is backtracking.
[12:22:38] <hayley> For very high speed these days, IIRC you're supposed to go branch-free and SIMD ideally. But handling submatches and a DFA of indeterminate size with SIMD seems too hard.
[12:22:39] <gilberth> hayley: I would care. I believe it's time for a correct POSIX RE implementation.

[12:23:41] <gilberth> hayley: I wonder if SIMD could really buy me much in case of a tokenizer. I'm not greping.
[12:23:51] <hayley> I wouldn't know.
[12:24:06] <hayley> I do weird things with SIMD sometimes, but not DFAs.
[12:24:27] * hayley does hash table probing, string subsearch, "Bloom filter" lookup, that's about it.
[12:25:14] <gilberth> I could do statistics, like how much white space skipping is there for some random C program. What the average length of a token is, etc.
[12:27:06] <hayley> It'd probably help to go branch-free for constant substrings, moreso with my minimum length inference.
[12:28:40] <gilberth> What I have in mind is essentially seeking for a character from a small subset, like seeking for "\" and """ in a string constant, or for #\newline within a comment, or perhaps for "*/" in a C comment.
[12:29:07] <hayley> But I think I will wait for the "NNNx faster than cl-ppcre" effect to wear off before I bother.
[12:29:38] <hayley> I'm already on https://common-lisp.net/libraries#header1-500
[12:29:43] <gilberth> I never really digged SIMD techniques, but I guess that would be almost trivial.
[12:30:16] <hayley> The one SIMD DFA I found only allowed 16 states and no submatching.
[12:31:24] <hayley> Say we simulate multiple DFAs running in parallel, and each has a position. Then maybe we hit a lookup table to advance each DFA on a byte. Problem: we have a lookup table.
[12:32:48] <hayley> http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~orestis/damon16.pdf does lookup tables. On the last page, you can see that the throughput goes to shit as they run out of cache with larger DFAs.
[12:33:12] <gilberth> Well, when I just look for a character 'a', I could xor with 'a'{n} and find a null octet. I assume SIMD can do that. But, I didn't dig that.
[12:33:46] <hayley> There are packed = instructions, but pretty much yes.
[12:34:08] <hayley> That is almost what I want to do with SIMD prefix scanning, but that's only for prefix strings and not a full RE.

[12:37:01] <hayley> The problem with selling portable Lisp systems for microcontrollers is that you can't sell hardware bundles, because no one needs those.

[12:37:15] <hayley> Admittedly I like it, but it's poor marketing.

[12:39:31] <hayley> And the worst case for optimistic stack allocation is very bad (you get to scan the whole stack) -- eh, maybe it's not worse than having to scan the whole stack to start GC (which I would make incremental for obvious reasons).
[12:40:44] <hayley> Concurrent GC with optimistic stack allocation and compile-time RC should kick butt for the average case.
[12:41:16] <gilberth> Still no market for that.
[12:41:39] <hayley> I disagree, as they sold more than 0 PyBoards or whatever.
[12:42:51] <gilberth> Yes, but why invest so much time into a programming language nobody wants to use to sell hardware nobody needs? The ROI is not particular good.
[12:43:38] <gilberth> Boards got real cheap, there isn't much left with each board sold.
[12:43:50] <hayley> Right, I can't sell hardware cause there's literally no point.
[12:45:20] <hayley> But see https://core-electronics.com.au/micropython-pyboard.html - $56.95 (36.45 EUR) for a STM32 board.
[12:47:10] <hayley> Or US$29 for a bytecode Scheme running on another STM32 https://shop.lambdachip.com/products/lambdachip-alonzo-board-standard-version
[12:47:23] <gilberth> How much does it cost to develop? How much to manufacture one board in small quantities at first, and how much do you have to sell? Also considering taxes.
[12:47:55] <hayley> The good thing about portability is that you don't have to make hardware, so the hardware is dead cheap. The bad thing is you get no money from hardware.
[12:48:22] <hayley> idk, I don't design microcontroller boards.
[12:55:31] <hayley> gilberth: But, remembering our favourite optimisation video: we can handle lookups fast, so no pin = blah.pin caching bullshit, we can inline so no loop unrolling or inline assembler, and we have fancy stack analysis, so forgetting to reuse a buffer is only slightly bad.
[12:58:04] <hayley> Maybe I should name the manual after https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZHDc3RmZgE
[12:58:58] <gilberth> Which manual?
[12:59:18] <hayley> For this hypothetical Lisp implementation.
[13:03:01] <ln43> anyhow i was trying to load an obj model but i cannot see anythig and the sad thing is that there is no error...
[13:03:26] <ln43> at least nothing of descriptive to help me solving the problem
[13:03:30] <hayley> I mean, you do basically nothing and the program magically runs fast. Paraphrasing the Unix Hater's Handbook, not having JIT and stack analysis and all makes a 200MHz ARM microcontroller run like a 16MHz ATmega chip.
[13:05:37] <ln43> and then i have a full model for an airplane and textures for the wings, the body, the tail and so on but i don't know how to identify each part simply
[13:08:42] <hayley> gilberth: So, no type annotations, no user-visible stack/heap allocation distinction, and little indication that there is even a compiler. I think, if we don't say it's there, someone would think we just wrote a fast interpreter.

[19:21:40] <sham1> Good early evening
[19:27:12] <gilberth> Yep, perfect time to get up as it's dark outside already.
[19:42:08] <selwyn> northern european life
[19:51:23] <shka> or unlife
[19:51:35] <selwyn> yes it is shit
[19:52:22] <selwyn> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLaiFmjUzi0
[19:52:47] <selwyn> really is like one of those strategy games
[19:52:51] <selwyn> a ridiculous situation
[19:53:00] <gilberth> Shit? I like it up north, although this isn't really that north.
[19:53:11] <selwyn> do you like the lack of sunlight
[19:53:15] <selwyn> well, i guess you do actually
[19:54:19] <shka> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jpVtYQIols
[19:54:26] <gilberth> Yes, I do. And remember: In summer it's the reverse.

[19:55:57] <gilberth> Or who else still has plenty sunlight at 23:00?
[19:56:46] <sham1> It's the reverse and in many ways it's worse. It makes it very difficult to sleep
[19:57:06] <gilberth> And, yes, I am a bit strange. While others suffer from winter depression, I actually don't like the summer, I do way better in winter time.
[19:57:26] <gilberth> shma1: Just sleep later. Problem solved.
[20:21:35] <selwyn> you are a real goth then :)

[20:41:41] <selwyn> tonight will be a mathematica night
[20:43:13] <gilberth> Sounds tedious. I'll have a clean-up-mess-and-write-some-documentation-night. Did I mention, that I hate writing documentation?
[20:43:39] <selwyn> mathematica is a good concept executed poorly
[20:44:14] <gilberth> Poorly? How so? I never used it.
[20:44:16] <selwyn> but more importantly, i managed to reduce a proof to a fuckton of algebra
[20:44:37] <selwyn> i am kind of a purist mathematician and like pen and paper approaches
[20:44:40] <selwyn> but i have my limits
[20:45:34] <selwyn> gilberth: it crashes quite a lot, it fails at doing hard numeric work (when this need not be the case), it is sort of a lisp in m-expr syntax, with all the baggage that entails
[20:45:40] <selwyn> the wolfram language is line noise
[20:45:43] <selwyn> i could go on
[20:45:56] <gilberth> Unless I really need to calculate some actual result, it never occurred to me to use anything else than pen and pencil.
[20:46:00] <selwyn> now i come to think of it, it is kind of like lisp in perl syntax
[20:46:43] <gilberth> Has it ties to Macsyma, or how come it uses m-expressions?
[20:47:09] <selwyn> beach wrote a pattern matcher engine (or sth similar) which he offered to wolfram but with no response
[20:47:17] <selwyn> a rule rewriter engine
[20:47:30] <selwyn> gilberth: it is somewhat of a rip off of macsyma
[20:47:47] <selwyn> i have very little macsyma experience so i can't comment in detail
[20:48:04] <selwyn> but when you learn mathematica it is obvious that they have dragged themselves halfway to lisp
[20:48:24] <selwyn> hence the m expressions
[20:50:09] <gilberth> There also is Reduce. As I was a teenager I had a nice CP/M 68k machine with a 20MB hard disk, 1MB of RAN, Lisp and Reduce for loan to further my hacking skills. Never returned it. Still have that monster, but I'll not fire it up because I would need to check the PSU first.
[20:51:39] <gilberth> Price tag was like DM 10,000. I had it for free. :-)
[20:52:21] <gilberth> selwyn: I have very little experience, but used Macsyma^WMaxima once in a while. I have little use for math which could be done with pen and paper.
[20:52:47] <gilberth> * could NOT be done ;I should stop thinking too positive.

[21:01:08] <selwyn> lucky you
[21:01:52] <gilberth> Indeed, I was pretty lucky and I am grateful for that.

[22:57:22] <mfiano> Not semantically 
[22:57:29] <mfiano> It is purely a convention
[22:57:52] <gilberth> A convention saying what? I see that a lot and wonder.
[22:58:07] <mfiano> The style guide says:
[22:58:09] <mfiano> You can use a leading underscore to indicate that a variable or function should not be used outside the package that defined it.
[22:59:08] <gilberth> ok. Makes little sense though, when I don't write a package, but just some script.
[22:59:27] <mfiano> For methods, it means "should not be used outside of this class"
[22:59:54] <gilberth> mfiano: Thanks. I take it now as being the same as "static ..." in C in spirit.
[23:02:21] <mfiano> Except not enforced, and doesn't change semantics like C vars.
[23:02:28] <mfiano> Think of it more like % in CL
[23:05:29] <gilberth> Well, it only changes linkage in C not semantics per se. And of course, I am aware that we talk about just a convention, which is why I said "in spirit".

[23:52:04] <edgar-rft> they want you to pay more tuition fee?
[23:52:42] <Jacobis9000> no
[23:52:46] <Jacobis9000> I have to program in Scratch
[23:53:52] <Jacobis9000> the first program I have to make is a program to record the number of tree species pupils in a class collect, and add them to lists depending on the percentage of species they find
[23:54:48] <gilberth> From scratch?
[23:54:59] <ln43> xd .. in scratch
[23:55:36] <Jacobis9000> in Scratch, the graphical programming language developed for kids
[23:56:18] <Jacobis9000> this version of it is called OUBuild, it's a specially modified version for the Open University
[23:56:18] <shka> hmmm
[23:56:21] <ln43> and that is a good tool to start...
[23:56:21] <Jacobis9000> on license from MIT
[23:56:26] <gilberth> So you scratch in scratch from scratch to scratch head?
[23:56:29] <edgar-rft> I didn't know that there is a programming language developed especially for me :-)
[23:56:33] <ln43> otherwise there is processing  (https://processing.org/)
[23:56:38] <shka> Uni courses sure are different nowadays 
[23:57:03] <Jacobis9000> this is the introductory module
[23:57:13] <Jacobis9000> the next module is programming with Python
[23:57:48] <Jacobis9000> I am beginning to wonder whether I should have gone for a postgraduate degree in computer science

[23:58:32] <edgar-rft> is this an uni where you get a math degree if you can cout up to three?
[23:58:34] <shka> programming!
[23:58:37] <Jacobis9000> but the fees for this undergraduate degree are £7.5k, and the grant for living costs is £18,000, so they're paying me £10,500 to do the course
