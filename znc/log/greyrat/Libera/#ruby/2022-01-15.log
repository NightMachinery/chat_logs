[01:36:50] <Guest43> Hello. I toyed a bit with Ruby years ago and recently found my way back. I was looking into the tooling and it seems like a straight `gem install foo` would install a package/library globally but if I wanted to keep them local to a project in a given directory, I'd use Bundler. Is that correct?
[01:38:35] <leah2> yeah
[01:40:43] <Guest43> Cool, thanks. And Bundler installs packages, not versions of Ruby.
[01:40:48] <leah2> yes
[01:40:57] <leah2> that's rbenv or other tools
[01:41:29] <Guest43> Right. Pretty sure I used rbenv back in the day. Looks like there's a handful of options there.

[04:41:30] <ox1eef> i remember when rbenv was released, and rbenv's author called rvm "obnoxious". The RVM author really took it to heart and more or less left open source. The lesson: be kind.
[04:43:16] <adam12> Seems we've had that problem more than once.
[04:47:55] <adam12> Is ruby-core dropping minitest for test-unit? I wonder what's going on with that.
[04:48:25] <ox1eef> i thought test-unit was dropped for minitest. full circle.
[04:49:02] <adam12> ox1eef: Yeah. That's why it's unclear.
[04:55:39] <ox1eef> that situation is confusing for sure, even when minitest was brought in i think there was a compatibility layer in place.
[04:55:43] <weaksauce> that's a bit of an extreme reaction though 
[04:57:09] <ox1eef> weaksauce: yeah, i can understand that. In this case i think he had just put his heart and soul into it, including being on irc to help people troubleshoot issues they had. 
[04:58:02] <leah2> i wrote a tiny virtual ruby thing and never got why people would get so invested in that stuff
[04:58:26] <weaksauce> yeah ox1eef it's unfortunate
[04:58:52] <weaksauce> it's not bad software per se  but it does a bit too much nowadays 
[04:59:10] <leah2> except for one gnarly rails project my distro ruby was always good enough for my stuff
[04:59:31] <weaksauce> and it always seemed to break too often
[04:59:38] <weaksauce> so i switched to chruby
[05:00:01] <weaksauce> and that didn't play well with vscode
[05:00:05] <weaksauce> so rbenv

[05:19:01] <adam12> I've been using frum for no reason other than it's only one tool and not multiple. I only use it for having a repl conveniently at hand. Everything else ends up in a Docker DevContainer because inevitably I want it to be similar to the prod environment for what I'm working and it's just simpler. VSCode supports it out of the box and then all the
[05:19:01] <adam12> extensions / etc work well.
