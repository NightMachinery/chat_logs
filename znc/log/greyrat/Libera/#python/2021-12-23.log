[02:50:36] <SnoopJ> rovanion, it's generally best to invoke pip as `python3 -m pip` to be sure you get a pip that is associated with the interpreter you want to use, but I'm not entirely sure that would fix this problem. More reading: https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/

[04:51:51] <grym> i don't know what the verb and noun of that sentence mean
[04:52:09] <blei> for example, a function
[04:53:45] <blei> python users would like to know whether they can persist a byte-compiled representation of a function object as a dictionary value (possibly persisted to ie BDB as mentioned in the python docs), avoiding any 'serialization / deserialization'
[04:54:53] <grym> pickles are serialised
[04:55:09] <blei> that is correct
[04:55:13] <grym> def foo(): ... ; {"foo":foo} is legal
[04:55:31] <grym> i still have no idea what shelve and bdb mean
[04:55:43] <blei> shelve is a core python module
[04:55:58] <grym> never used it
[04:56:00] <blei> its a persisted dictionary, with a connector to Oracle Berkeley DB, a key-value store
[04:56:15] <grym> i try to avoid both pickles and the works of oracle; perhaps that explains it
[04:56:38] <blei> in terms of performance, oracle has the best available databases (such as TenTen). however, they can be expensive. Berkeley DB is free
[04:56:43] <blei> *TimesTen
[04:57:00] <blei> and recommended in the Python docs.

[04:59:47] <blei> it would be cheapest if it was pre-compiled, you pulled the function out of the database, and ran it
[05:00:09] <nedbat> blei: that's unusual to store code in a database.
[05:00:30] <blei> not really. AWS Lambda stores code in a key-value store, S3
[05:01:54] <blei> the usefulness is not really in question, considering that the overhead is microseconds and therefore negligible for many potential use cases.
[05:02:17] <nedbat> blei: pickles don't store code anyway, so they won't help you

[05:02:33] <blei> dictionaries store arbitrary python objects.
[05:02:59] <blei> a shelve is a persisted dictionary. shelve + BDB is a persisted dictionary backed by a high performance key-value store
[05:03:28] <nedbat> blei: ok, shelve might do what you want, I'm not sure.
[05:03:32] <nedbat> blei: pickles won't.
[05:03:46] <MacGyver> nedbat: pickle can handle functions defined at the top level of a module.
[05:04:06] <MacGyver> Not that I think anyone should, mind, pickle is here be dragons territory.
[05:04:23] <nedbat> MacGyver: yes, but it doesn't store the function, it just references it, and counts on the same module being available when unpickling
[05:04:24] <MacGyver> Oh wait, this is about the code.

[05:05:17] <nedbat> blei: why do you need to avoid serialization? you have to deserialize

[05:05:47] <blei> how to speak in bytes
[05:05:52] <nedbat> blei: storing data in a database suggests a stream of bytes
[05:06:46] <blei> i agree; how to get the byte repr of a python function?
[05:07:41] <nedbat> blei: you should look into how .pyc files work.  they are an entire module.

[15:36:50] <flower_> Note
[15:36:50] <flower_> Because liblo creates its own thread to receive and dispatch messages, callback functions will not be run in the main Python thread!

[15:38:08] <bjs> flower_: well, that's a hard question to answer?  You should be aware the callbacks won't run in the main thread?

[15:41:53] <dvyd> I'd like to create a nested loop where I iterate through objects and also iterate through fields or computations on fields of those objects. I think I need to use "exec" but I cannot figure out how to do it. In the simple case, I just get the value of the field. In the more advanced case, I get the value and then perform some computation like
[15:41:54] <dvyd> len(field). Here is a nonworking example: https://pastebin.com/iQNXHeKJ

[18:05:20] <jinsun> having `__str__` method means you can do str(reset), not that it will be called automatically when you add it to strings

[18:05:48] <SnoopJ> e.g. `"test" + 3` is also an error, but this isn't a fault, it's just that the + operation isn't meaningful between these types
[18:06:16] <bjs> randall: what you want is string formatting. `print(f"{fg.red}some text{reset}")`  (or a library that can do these kind of ansi escaping for you for text)

[21:04:44] <kittonian> this is for an iOS app where an email needs to be verified via OTP so I'm generating a random number
[21:04:46] <ChrisWarrick> I wouldn’t solve it in the script you showed
[21:04:51] <kittonian> but I need to send that number via e-mail
[21:04:58] <kittonian> ok, what's your suggestion
[21:05:14] <oscarplaisant> just about readability, maybe using str(...) instead of digit[...] could be better
[21:05:40] <ChrisWarrick> kittonian: call the script once in your zope code, save the result in a database or stuff
[21:05:53] <kittonian> i don't want to save it in a database
[21:06:14] <kittonian> i want a variable I can reference so I can display the generated number in multiple locations
[21:06:17] <ChrisWarrick> kittonian: if you want the code to be different for every user, but one value for a given user, you can’t do it otherwise
[21:06:25] <oscarplaisant> also, you want to generate a random number with 4 digits, and you want to be able to change easily the number of digits
[21:06:27] <kittonian> sure i can
[21:06:28] <ChrisWarrick> 18:36:14 <kittonian> i want a variable I can reference so I can display the generated number in multiple locations
[21:06:32] <ChrisWarrick> ↑ that’s a zope question
[21:06:41] <kittonian> no it's not
[21:06:48] <oscarplaisant> you can simply use random and math.floor ! no need for a string or anything
[21:07:00] *** Joins: lethu (~lethu@user/lethu)
[21:07:16] <kittonian> right now this is an external method in zope
[21:07:28] <oscarplaisant> OTP = math.floor(random.random() * 10 ** nb_digits)
[21:07:40] <kittonian> if I call to it in the two places I need it via <dtml-var generateOTP> it generates two different random numbers
[21:07:49] <ChrisWarrick> kittonian: see, that’s a zope question
[21:07:55] <kittonian> it's not
[21:07:56] <ChrisWarrick> kittonian: how do I call an external method in zope once and store the result
[21:08:23] *** Joins: clarkk (~clarkk@host86-165-12-159.range86-165.btcentralplus.com)
[21:08:25] <kittonian> because if I do <dtml-with generateOTP></dtml-with> then I can reference a variable of <dtml-var OTP> inside in multiple places
[21:08:31] <kittonian> so I need a variable of the output
[21:08:38] <kittonian> which was my initial question
[21:08:43] <bjs> kittonian: can you make a Python variable?
[21:08:46] <bjs> OPT = generateOPT()  somewhere
[21:09:08] <bjs> I'm not sure where this "self" comes from in your generateOTP function though
[21:09:10] <kittonian> bjs, of course i can
[21:09:23] <kittonian> don't worry about self, it's a zope thing for external methods
[21:09:23] <bjs> kittonian: doesn't that answer your question then? I'm a bit confused
[21:09:58] <kittonian> bjs, how does that change anything from calling generateOTP multiple times, if I just call the variable that equals generateOTP multiple times?
[21:10:02] <kittonian> that's the same thing
[21:10:08] <bjs> kittonian: what do you mean "call the variable"
[21:10:22] <kittonian> seriously. this cannot be that hard to understand
[21:10:27] <bjs> kittonian: if I go `OPT = generateOPT()` it calls the function generateOPT once and stores the value in the variable OTP

[21:11:51] <kittonian> because it's the same thing as running <dtml-var generateOTP>
[21:12:02] <kittonian> it's not a zope question. it's standard programming and works the same in any language
[21:12:04] <bjs> is it the same? I don't know zope but why would it be the same
[21:12:20] <kittonian> fred = blah()
[21:12:27] <kittonian> call to fred it runs blah
[21:12:27] <bjs> <dtml-var name> is clearly a zope thing and zope would define what it does, I'm not sure what you mean.  My paste shows you how to do this in Python
[21:12:34] <kittonian> call to fred again, it will run blah again

[23:00:52] <BinarySavior> also, during the runtime of my script, i noticed RAM is going to 99% capacity, but I dont see the SDD being used more than 1 or 2 %
[23:01:25] <BinarySavior> if python runs out of memory does it start to use the hard drive for additional storage or does it stop itself before it gets to that point
[23:01:43] <SnoopJ> BinarySavior, the OS determines whether or not you'll get swapping
[23:03:25] *** Joins: rickybob (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob)
[23:03:32] <BinarySavior> so if python is trying to load an object into memory, but RAM is at 99%, OS does not provide swapping, what happens to the python program?
[23:04:03] <SnoopJ> BinarySavior, any allocation call to the OS will fail, and Python will wrap that failure in an exception, probably MemoryError
[23:07:27] <SnoopJ> CPython, that is. I'm not sure about other implementations, but *hopefully* they will do the same.
[23:08:20] <BinarySavior> so since my program made it through the 99% RAM, it's safe to assume the OS provided swapping, right?
[23:08:47] <BinarySavior> if that's the case, why didn't I see a spike in disk io bandwidth to 100%?
[23:08:53] <SnoopJ> I wouldn't assume anything, I would find out
[23:09:47] <ChrisWarrick> BinarySavior: what OS are you on?
[23:09:56] <BinarySavior> windows 10 unfortunately
[23:10:06] <ChrisWarrick> BinarySavior: windows is a reasonable operating system
[23:10:20] <ChrisWarrick> BinarySavior: it has swap by default
[23:10:27] <BinarySavior> ah okay
[23:10:50] <SnoopJ> yea if you're at the RAM ceiling and not crashing, something is probably swapping somewhere if allocs are continuing to happen
[23:10:57] <ChrisWarrick> linux, on the other hand, goes haywire if you run out of memory
[23:11:18] <BinarySavior> yea i've noticed that too haha
[23:11:25] <SnoopJ> sometimes the oomkiller eats your program :(
[23:11:45] <ChrisWarrick> SnoopJ: oh, I’d love it if the oomkiller ate the correct program
[23:11:51] <SnoopJ> heh
[23:12:03] <ChrisWarrick> it instead eats a random chrome/electron process but not the culprit
[23:12:19] <BinarySavior> i once let a genetic sequencing program (metabat2) run on linux and it ate up all my ram and started using the hard drive, I could not do anything but let it do it's thing.  the peripherals were unresponsive, but i let it go and came back the next day and it had finished the job
[23:12:32] <SnoopJ> it's usually my program that it eats because ours are very RAM hungry, but learning about RLIMIT_RSS has at least helped me avoid some of that headache
