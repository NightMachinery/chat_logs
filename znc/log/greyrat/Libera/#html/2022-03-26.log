[15:46:39] <Bushmaster> Hi, not sure its the right place, to ask, but CSS may be right channel, but I ask here first and see what some of you folks say, my website layout changes from browser to browser, in Firefox browser it looks all fine, but in Microsoft Edge the layout gets changes, especially borders at the bottom of the page ...any idea how to ensure nothing gets changes from browser to browser?

[16:10:05] <[twisti]> Bushmaster: adjust and test until it looks the same in at least the four major browsers + phones and tablets
[16:10:34] <[twisti]> its a ton of work but youll get used to having a dozen browsers and emulators open
[16:10:36] <[twisti]> welcome to webdesign :(
[16:13:50] <Bushmaster> [twisti], thanks a lot, yes it certainly changes hugely in mobile devices like tablet and cell phones, and also I noticed, if I click the minimize window from the top left of the browser, the design does not adjust itself, so landing page of my portfolio site's words gets overlap with images on the left 
[16:15:47] <[twisti]> you may want to google 'responsive design' and read up a bit on that

[16:44:43] <Bushmaster> [twisti], yes you are very right, is it hard to pick up responsive design?
[16:49:30] <[twisti]> its more tedious than hard
[16:53:25] <Bushmaster> [twisti], hehehe yes, good word, these are tedious and annoying, I just found out, in CSS class, if I change values unit from px to percent, then screen minimize automate texts and does not overlap with images set to lets say 40% than 40px 
[16:58:22] <Bushmaster> actually percent works well than px or pt unit in width and height units 
[17:00:16] <[twisti]> Bushmaster: check out https://css-tricks.com/fun-viewport-units/ which are very helpful
