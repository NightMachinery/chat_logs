[02:47:25] <ggreer> kuudes: that quote is out of context. the prosecutor said he had an image on his ipad that he wanted to pinch-zoom to show to the jury. he said it was a copy of an image that had already been admitted into evidence, but claimed that zooming would show that rittenhouse was pointing his rifle at someone before rosenbaum chased him
[02:48:20] <ggreer> so the defense went "whoa whoa whoa" because that image hasn't gone through the normal chain of evidence. the prosecutor could have fucked with it or chosen a photo viewing/editing app that used scaling algorithms that happened to introduce artifacts that made rittenhouse look guilty
[02:49:43] <ggreer> this is the same prosecutor that one witness already claimed had asked him to alter his sworn testimony to help incriminate joshua ziminski
[02:50:04] <ggreer> and today the prosecution's expert witness admitted to using a "smart resize" feature of amped five for the image that the prosecution claims shows rittenhouse pointing a gun at someone before any shooting happens. nobody except software engineers at amped know what algorithm was used to upscale the original image
[02:50:22] <ggreer> and nobody in that courtroom had any clue how any resizing algorithms worked (including the expert witnesses)
[02:50:27] <kuudes> hmm
[02:51:07] <ggreer> the expert witness actually got nearest neighbor wrong. when asked if there were blue pixels adjacent to red pixels in an original image, what the color would be "between" them in a nearest-neighbor upscaled image, he said they'd be purple

"How, gwern, can Nome, where half the year it is a death sentence to be out overnight, and which has like 1 traffic light, have 'a homeless problem'?" I'm glad you asked. it's a fascinating intersection of perverse incentives, subsidies, and social dysfunction. so the way the alaskan medical system works is a triage...
[04:57:01] <gwern> ...hub-and-spoke model where each level kicks you up to the next. if the nurse in your remote alaskan village throws up their hands, you need to fly to the next level. but flying is very expensive when you're a subsistence First Nations-type. fortunately, they have royalties, and you get an automatic plane ticket to/from Nome when you get kicked up from the Nome-village-feeders to Nome, and...
[04:57:07] <gwern> ...the hospital also has an attached dorm-hotel for obvious reasons (there being like 2 tiny hotels in Nome). sensible, right? here's the kicker: because indigenous peoples are *so* incredibly dysfunctional around alcohol, all of those villages are legally 'dry'. except... Nome. Nome has liquor stores. so when villagers get a ticket to Nome, they will raid the liquor store to bring home booze...
[04:57:13] <gwern> ...to the clan. ok, weird. it gets worse: people will fake or exaggerate medical problems just for the liquor trip. well, that's bad but it's still basically the indigenous peoples' money they're blowing, so not a big deal. worse: when they've bought all that liquor for their relatives who can't handle their liquor, they can't handle their liquor either... and they miss their flight back,...
[04:57:19] <gwern> ...voiding their ticket, and have nowhere to stay because the hospital has kicked them out. Their relatives, being so poor (which is why they needed to scam the ticket to Nome in the first place) may not be able to stump up a plane ticket until the welfare checks come, many moons later. and in the mean time, look what they have a suitcase stuffed full of... apparently there is exactly 1...

[05:28:22] <gwern> ...blood... by the end, after advising her to euthanize the vermin, he'd threatened to smash all the windows, the mother had fled the house, he'd left for a hotel to spend the rest of the visit there, and they may never talk again

[05:31:46] <Betawolf> wait, so he brought the pet ferret with him to see his grandchild, or it was already there?
[05:33:19] <Betawolf> I'm also unclear on how smashing all the windows in the house would've helped matters, but I sense he might have moved on from kind advice at that stage of the conversation.

[07:18:44] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: alaska is a state in USA, how is flying expensive? I thought flight prices should have been normalized throughout the US by now.
[07:19:15] <gwern> you're not hopping on a fully loaded jumbojet to las vegas and getting amortized rates from first class, you know
[07:19:35] <gwern> plus, these are subsistence level people. if you have money, you can spend it on booze
[07:20:41] <gwern> nothing in alaska is 'normalized' unless you've forgotten all about costs of scale, distance, and other friction which is why the law of one price is not 'law of one price everywhere and everywhen'
[07:21:29] <PapuaHardyNet> rmmh: people who use GPT-3 instead of using open source models always make me cringe unless they are companies. Why are they so eager to give their personal data (especially what you would say to your late fiance) to openai?
[07:23:27] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: right, that makes sense
[07:23:55] <rmmh> well, GPT-J wasn't available when this was starting
[07:25:39] <PapuaHardyNet> rmmh: a sensible man would use GPT-2 huge and collect training data as he used it and wait for an updated open source model to be released
[07:25:40] <gwern> indeed. I had to tell him about it

[07:26:06] <rmmh> ot
[07:26:25] <rmmh> it requires several orders of magnitude more equipment and programming to train your own GPT model vs calling an API
[07:26:35] <PapuaHardyNet> so is he running his virtual fiance using gpt-j now? that's good to hear
[07:26:44] <rmmh> idk what he's doing now, he's weird
[07:27:29] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, calling an API is easy, but would you want openAI people to sit in the same room as you and your fiance all the time? chilling effects, you know
[07:27:38] <gwern> I mean, rohrer wasn't himself talking to his dead fiancee. I think she's fine. that was one of his more sympathetic users
[07:27:48] <gwern> who knows what that user is doing these days. might be at novelai or something
[07:29:07] <PapuaHardyNet> novelai uses prompt tuning to finetune its models cheaply. that's one problem solved
[07:30:00] <PapuaHardyNet> so long term memory is solved, to a certain extent
[07:30:50] <PapuaHardyNet> for short term memory, we have no sensible solutions, the limited input token length means long conversations or texts lose context
[07:31:14] <PapuaHardyNet> AID tried to use a "summary" to compensate for this but that seems to be a rather awkward workaround

[07:33:53] <gwern> no, it's the new book summarizer

[11:26:16] <Obormot\Gaia> saturn2: No, you do
[11:26:39] <Obormot\Gaia> saturn2: You pretty much have to inline it in order to not get the flash
[11:29:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, the tricky part is avoiding the flash *while* also having user-configurable dark mode
[11:29:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that part requires inlined JS and inline CSS
[11:31:21] <rmmh> just put the mode in a cookie
[11:31:28] <rmmh> and serve differential css based on a cookie value
[11:31:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> -_-
[11:32:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> You understand that gwern.net is a static site, right
[11:32:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Furthermore, doing it that way will *definitely* cause a flash of white
[11:33:14] <feep[work]> huh? no, like, only even send the required mode
[11:33:19] <saturn2> there's no flashes for me on GW and it works the way rmmh said
[11:33:45] <feep[work]> ie. if the server knows the client is in darkmode, send only darkmode css, else if lightmode, only lightmode css, else send both and set a cookie
[11:33:59] *** dxdx is now known as dx
[11:34:04] <feep[work]> problem: you do get a flash when you navigate to the side after changing mode in your os.
[11:34:14] <feep[work]> since the site has to reload itself once.
[11:34:25] <feep[work]> so sending both is probably better.
[11:35:02] <ggreer> just obey the browser's setting. don't add a manual toggle
[11:35:09] * Obormot\Arcturus facepalm
[11:35:11] <ggreer> it's simpler. it requires no cookies
[11:35:40] <feep[work]> css (less than) twice the size, but it compresses well anyways.
[11:35:52] <ggreer> use css variables

[11:36:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some people, actually, do not want their websites to be dark when they have their system set to dark mode!
[11:37:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> I know! It sounds crazy! *And yet it is true.*
[11:37:11] <feep[work]> oh, that, I see.

[11:37:48] <ggreer> let them complain
[11:37:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Sometimes this is because their system *can't* be set to dark mode!)

[11:39:59] <kuudes> refrigerator!
[11:41:04] <saturn2> relying on every individual web site to implement dark mode correctly was a very silly decision
[11:41:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> I agree but that's where we are
[11:42:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> So as a doer-of-websites your choice is "correctly implement dark mode" or "people point and laugh at you and never read your website at night"
[11:42:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> For some websites it's not worth the effort, but gwern.net is for sure not one of those
[11:44:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Anyway, as far as "send twice the CSS" goes, that's not how it is. We *do* use CSS variables, just as ggreer suggests... there's a (small!) set of "dark mode styles", which is sent in all cases, and which just consist of setting said CSS variables to appropriate values; and the effect of the toggle is just to switch between "the dark mode styles are active" / "the dark mode styles are not active" / "the dark mode
[11:44:54] <Obormot\Arcturus>  styles are active or not active according to the system setting" [the default]

[23:06:50] <mst> if anybody's training an NN with duplicat detection, here's a free input image: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FEAMhqpVkAINaHs?format=jpg&name=900x900
[23:07:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: btw let me just say that it's super weird to click on News and be taken to your substack when all I want is a list of the newsletter pages -_-
[23:07:34] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: It's like... 3-4 extra clicks :\
[23:07:46] <gwern> Obormot\Gaia: bah, those are like, oldsletters
[23:08:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok well that's what the "News" link at the left takes you to!
[23:08:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> It sucks!
[23:10:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: "On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models"?
[23:10:31] <gwern> yes
[23:10:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> (btw there's a stray closing-square-bracket in the extract there)
[23:11:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, no, this one is fine
[23:13:28] <gwern> let's see... https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/image.png is that what it's supposed to look like? I thought it was stretched out
[23:14:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope, that's correct
[23:15:41] <gwern> oh. ok, then I guess you are right about it being /index specific then
[23:16:08] <gwern> anyway, now that I am not busy petting oolong who is upset about me being gone and strangers present, what do you think 'News' *should* link to?
[23:16:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whatever it linked to before you made it a substack link
[23:16:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was just a list of newsletter pages iirc
[23:16:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Reverse-chrono
[23:16:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Simple, effective, useful, quick to navigate (and navigable via popups, by the way, unlike the substack link!)
[23:17:12] <gwern> hm. maybe it should just link to the latest issue?
[23:17:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> But why
[23:17:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> What was wrong with how it was??
[23:17:23] <gwern> it *would* be the newest news
[23:17:34] <gwern> and I linked to substack originally with the idea in mind of increasing subscriptions
[23:17:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did it?
[23:17:47] <gwern> had to say. didn't exactly do a RCT
[23:18:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, well, maybe include a substack link in the newsletter list page. I dunno
[23:18:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> All I know is, the way you have it, it's an additional pain in the ass for ... no user-beneficial reason
[23:18:49] <gwern> (it makes signup faster, that benefits a user)
[23:19:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does it, though
[23:19:21] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:19:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, put a link on the page, then
[23:19:30] <gwern> all users benefit from signing up to my mailing list, whether they realize it or not
[23:19:49] *** Joins: src (~src@user/src)
[23:23:04] *** Quits: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:32:54] <gwern> shawwwn: yes, I know about it. using features from a CNN classifier embedding is a very old GAN trick. it wasn't available to us because we don't have any decent anime classifiers. deepdanbooru *might* have some we could've used, but no one has actually done it. CLIP embeddings would probably also work, but also not available
[23:33:30] <gwern> two2thehead: it's a 4h drive one way, so 8h+ total. exceedingly excessive for a book which is merely a public service to put online
[23:35:58] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: in other news, I have *finally* fixed most of the sporadic backlinks errors that'd been occuring. turns out I had underescaped a few special chars in strings. /sigh. that was miserable to figure out, quoting/escaping always is because you confuse yourself and what you see is by definition not what you get... I also figured out how to disable popups on...
[23:36:04] <gwern> ...indexes/link-bibliographies, so on eg https://www.gwern.net/docs/nicotine/index if a literal popup is possible, it goes straight to that instead of simply popping up the annotation a second time
[23:37:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cool

[23:52:37] <SDr> :/
[23:55:21] <gwern> SDr: so what do people say now instead of any of those...
[23:56:44] <SDr> gwern, so, I have the same rss reader since '05, and there are pages and pages of people, topics, and sites that are _just dead_.
[23:57:04] <gwern> SDr: right, but are they saying 'people on tiktok', 'the twitterverse' or what
[23:57:35] <gwern> like, sure, 'tumblr' is pretty dead. 'blogs' are dead. but people spend more time than ever on social media yakking away
[23:57:44] <gwern> so what's the missing set of terms in those google trends
[23:58:13] <SDr> that's the thing. There is no "communal name" because it's not done by the community; people refer to the services -tiktok, twitter-because the algorithm is the dominating factor, while the community is merely a bunch of parameters
