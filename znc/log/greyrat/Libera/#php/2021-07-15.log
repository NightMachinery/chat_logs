[00:00:02] <TinoDidriksen> Don't know if Arch has a helper, but you can just ask phpinfo() where php.ini is.
[00:04:35] <Ox151> do you just enable and disable modules you want from the php.ini file?
[00:05:11] <guidoc> Ox151: sudo echo extension=intl | tee /etc/php/conf.d/override.ini
[00:05:29] <guidoc> this way it won't be overwritten when you upgrade php
[00:06:10] <guidoc> echo extension=intl | sudo tee /etc/php/conf.d/override.ini *
[00:06:25] <guidoc> er that's not right either
[00:07:20] *** Quits: Akimb (~Akimb@86.100.13.100) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:07:45] <guidoc> nevermind it's echo extension=intl | sudo tee /etc/php/conf.d/override.ini
[00:08:29] <Ox151> what is extension=intl?
[00:08:49] <Ox151> ah ok i see it from the class page
[00:08:50] <guidoc> internationalization functions, which includes the class you linked
[00:08:55] <Ox151> i linked
[00:09:23] <Ox151> than you i will try that out.
[00:09:57] <guidoc> remember to sudo systemctl reload php-fpm
[00:12:09] <Ox151> ok thank you, if I wanted to add other modules, would I just add a new extension=stuff, or would it be extensions=intl, stuff
[00:12:18] <Ox151> a new line
[00:12:56] <guidoc> add lines
[00:12:59] *** Joins: P1RATEZ (piratez@user/p1ratez)
[00:19:04] <Sammitch> assuming that the intl extension is bundled in with arch's base PHP package, which would be odd to bundle but not enable...
[00:20:39] <Sammitch> which, after a cursory googline, doesn't look like is the case. you'll need to install php-intl which may or may not automatically add the config to enable it
[00:21:07] <guidoc> yeah it's a separate package
[00:22:47] <Ox151> good point, just installed it, it was in the repo. my system doesn't seem to have php-fpm to restart though
[00:23:11] <Sammitch> what httpd are you using?
[00:23:58] <guidoc> then restart your web server
[00:24:11] <guidoc> for apache, sudo systemctl restart httpd
[00:24:20] <Ox151> i am just using php -S localhost:8080
[00:24:42] <Sammitch> yeah uhhh, don't use that for anything other than the most basic testing, and even then... maybe not
[00:24:48] <Sammitch> but for now, restart that process
[00:28:59] <Ox151> ok, that worked thank you. yes the php -S localhost:8080 is just for practicing with php
[00:30:09] <Ox151> is there a module for turning numbers into roman numerals? or does a function have to be created for that?

[00:34:18] <Sammitch> yeah the more esoteric stuff is going to be in composer packages, if anything
[00:35:51] <nobodies> will this if statement do what I think it should, e.g. check that there csrf token in either a get or post matches the one in session; if (isset($_GET['csrf_token']) && $_GET['csrf_token'] || isset($_POST['csrf_token']) && $_POST['csrf_token'] === $_SESSION['csrf_token']) {
[00:36:25] <nucc1> nobodies use $_REQUEST
[00:36:59] <nobodies> oh OK
[00:37:30] <nucc1> https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.request
[00:38:25] <nobodies> thanks I'll take a look at that :)
[00:38:48] <Sammitch> honestly you should explicitly know if the request is a GET or POST and check the relevant superglobal
[00:39:19] <nucc1> Sammitch there are times when you don't care
[00:39:25] <Sammitch> lots of stuff gets munged together into REQUEST which makes it... gross to use
[00:39:51] <Sammitch> sounds like a red flag to me, but you do you
[00:42:01] <nucc1> nobodies on php version > 7, I think you can also do: $csrf_token = $_POST['csrf_token'] ?? $_GET['csrf_token']; // this will take the value from post, and if not, from GET.
[00:44:50] <nucc1> nobodies https://ideone.com/8zzM2O
[00:45:20] <nucc1> test first of course :)

[17:47:11] *** Joins: gefd (~gef@user/gefd)
[17:47:16] <Daulity> the php code doesn't display the contents generated in a certain function
[17:48:12] <Daulity> when i look at the source it does display the <h1></h1> but then the function called after doesn't actually display anything on the page. two other functions underneath do how ever work and show content
[17:48:31] <Daulity> i am trying to debug why this is, but i am no expert on php (i have programming experience)
[17:50:39] <Daulity> in side that function i can do a echo and it does display on the page
[17:50:54] <Daulity> maybe something in the logic for generating the output is wrong then.
[17:51:20] <Nomikos> can you pastebin the offending code?

[17:58:24] <__adrian> there are several conditions there that could lead to the function (correctly) doing nothing.

[17:59:36] <Daulity> atleast one difference
[17:59:48] <__adrian> not necessarily.  if ($index != 1 && $index != count($result))  if (count($package) == 3)  if any one of those conditions isn't met, it would do nothing
[18:00:12] <Nomikos> or if $result is empty

[18:01:28] <Nomikos> the code looks correct

[22:41:44] <__adrian> arash: !+error reporting
[22:41:44] <php-bot> arash, Set `error_reporting = -1` in your php.ini (to see errors on your webpage, also set `display_errors = 1`) and be sure to restart your webserver/fastcgi-listeners. Using `ini_set()` and `error_reporting()` is less reliable - for example, in the case of parse errors. See https://php.net/errorfunc.configuration or "/msg php-bot error logging" for more.
[22:42:01] <__adrian> arash: rather, !+error logging
[22:42:01] <php-bot> arash: rather, In addition to configuring error reporting (/msg php-bot error reporting), set log_errors=1 and error_log=/path/to/your/error.log in your php.ini file. This allows you to simply tail the log to see errors, and to disable display_errors (e.g., during production).

[23:04:07] <arash> I set "error_log=/var/log/phperrorlog.log
[23:04:07] <arash> " in php.ini file in /etc/php.ini but in phpinfo() it shows /var/log/php-fpm/www-error.log for error_log. why ?

[23:13:15] <Sammitch> phpinfo() should also tell you what ini files PHP is actually loading
[23:18:51] <__adrian> arash: if by "from linux" you mean from a shell, you need to understand that that's a different config (possibly even a different install or even version) of php

[23:19:30] <__adrian> check  php -i  for the cli. check  phpinfo()  (via the browser) for the web.
[23:20:41] <arash> __adrian, I added a phpinfo() in a file and run it via browser the address of php.ini is /etc/php.ini so i think its override with apache settings
[23:21:09] <__adrian> phpinfo() will also tell you the settings actually applied
[23:22:50] <arash> yes, it should be error_log=/var/log/phperrorlog.log but its /var/log/php-fpm/www-error.log. i don't know exactly what caused this

[23:32:44] <arash> can i change the location of error_log in a php file ?
[23:33:53] <__adrian> no
[23:34:07] <__adrian> fix your server config if it's not logging in the place you want
[23:34:58] <__adrian> i.e., figure out what's changing it and change it back
[23:35:40] <__adrian> "no"* well, unlikely. and it would be non ideal and less reliable.
[23:39:22] <Sammitch> even if its a human user that can copy/paste you the error message instead of a telegram callback, that's a pretty shit method of collecting error messages
[23:52:29] <arash> what about using xdebug.org ? its a same php error log with more details and features ?
[23:53:03] <__adrian> xdebug is for debugging. it's not a logger.
[23:53:58] <__adrian> why wouldn't you fix the configuration?
[23:55:54] <arash> __adrian, i findout there is no problem to tail /var/log/php-fpm/www-error.log for now, what configuration should i check ? i didn't find anything in http.conf or .htaccess. what other places should i check ?

[23:56:25] <__adrian> i oculdn't answer that; talk to whoever set up your server
[23:56:28] <__adrian> *couldn't
[23:57:08] <arash> __adrian, ok. then i think i should leave it for now. thank you
