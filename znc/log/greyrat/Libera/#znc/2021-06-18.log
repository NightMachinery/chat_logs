[01:35:28] <CoreISP> So regarding buffers. Automatic clearing the buffer apparently means that when using different clients, they cannot be in sync unless they're connected at the same time. Disabling this feature however apparently causes a retransmission of the buffers on each connect? Then there's apparently a module "Clientbuffer", but installing it is apparently not recommended for 1.8.2. So what is the best way to keep various clients in sync whilst them
[01:35:28] <CoreISP>  being connected at the same time will not always be the case? 
[01:37:52] <orangeboxcutter> i use clientbuffer on 1.8.2, haven't had any issues

[01:53:51] <CoreISP> orangeboxcutter: so when you use that module, if I understand it correctly, it'll keep the exact same buffer for all clients (limited to your buffer limit of course) and they will sync their own buffer without retransmissions upon reconnect? 
[01:56:07] <MetaNova> more or less
[01:56:34] <MetaNova> the "persistent buffers" is what enables/ensures each client gets the playback
[01:56:50] <MetaNova> *clientbuffer improves this by having an independent buffer per-client
[01:57:13] <MetaNova> meaning you can do things like clear a buffer (channel/query) for one client but have the other client's buffer intact
[01:57:21] <CoreISP> Well what Im really trying to achieve is that when I connect from my phone's IRC client and I login an hour later the client on my Mac that it doesn't expunge all traffic. I want it all to show up on my Mac as well :) 
[01:57:51] <CoreISP> (Including any message I may have sent from the phone)
[01:58:01] <MetaNova> the absolutely minimum requirement for that to be accomplished is having route_replies loaded and persistent buffers enabled
[01:58:24] <MetaNova> clientbuffer is recommended, though, in addition to that, but it's not technically necessary
[01:58:44] <MetaNova> as far as seeing your OWN messages, that depends on what each of your clients are, and if they support the self-message cap
[01:58:54] <MetaNova> I think I made a redirect at [[self-message]
[01:58:58] <MetaNova> [[self-message]]
[01:58:59] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/self-message
[01:59:35] <CoreISP> The persistent buffer I cannot seem to find in the settings, I did find route_replies
[01:59:52] <MetaNova> CoreISP: it's not a single setting
[01:59:59] <MetaNova> example of configuring persistent buffers:
[02:00:07] <MetaNova> /msg *status loadmod controlpanel
[02:00:13] <MetaNova> /msg *controlpanel set AutoClearChanBuffer $me false
[02:00:19] <MetaNova> /msg *controlpanel set AutoClearQueryBuffer $me false
[02:00:42] <CoreISP> Ohh I have those two disabled
[02:00:58] *** Joins: fb61 (~Frank@ip-109-40-129-147.web.vodafone.de)
[02:01:23] <CoreISP> Apparently Textual has support for self-message, but IglooIRC (the phone client) isn't on the exhaustive list; so guess I'll have to ask the dev or in their channel
[02:02:29] <CoreISP> "a client must request the znc.in/self-message capability in order to receive self messages in buffer playback" - is the client supposed to do that automagically?
[02:02:50] <orangeboxcutter> palaver does i believe
[02:02:54] <orangeboxcutter> for ios
[02:04:58] <CoreISP> It is on the list indeed
[02:05:27] <CoreISP> I had downloaded Igloo because it seemed to be under development, whereas Palaver looked a bit outdated and hasn't seen any updates in 2021 
[02:05:34] <CoreISP> You got good experience with Palaver? :)
[02:06:17] *** Joins: XrD (~LvH@simplemachines/serverteam/CoreISP)
[02:07:26] <orangeboxcutter> it's simple but works great with znc
[02:07:27] <MetaNova> CoreISP: most clients negotiate all the CAPs they support, some do not - weechat, I know, specifically, requires the user to activate/specify what CAPs they want weechat to negotiate
[02:08:22] <CoreISP> That sounds a wee bit annoying. (Sorry, couldn't resist.)
[02:08:28] <CoreISP> Hmm, I'll have another look at Palaver then
[02:08:56] <CoreISP> I don't need anything advanced, I mean... it's IRC after all and I've been used to BitchX for years, nothing overly fancy
[02:12:03] <CoreISP> Thing is. Igloo has dark mode :')

[03:54:13] <CoreISP> if so, any problems with it?
[03:56:03] <CoreISP> I keep getting stuff from "route_replies" complaining something ain't working right: https://pastebin.com/fCvbHJTe 
[03:56:14] <CoreISP> I think this started happening after I connected with Palaver 
[03:57:58] <MetaNova> >Last request: ISON *status *clientbuffer *Palaver *route_replies
[03:58:14] <MetaNova> strange that your client is trying to check ISON for modules
[03:58:55] <MetaNova> (it shouldn't be)
[03:59:24] <CoreISP> I'm not sure which client is responsible for it, but I'm guessing Palaver since I've been connected with Textual for hours with no errors :P
[03:59:43] <MetaNova> between the two I'd guess Palaver is being silly as well
[04:00:00] <MetaNova> probably adds whatever you've queried to the ISON list
[04:00:10] <MetaNova> [how peculiar]
[04:01:31] <CoreISP> Can you see the message from XrD?
[04:01:35] <gothkat> I remember Palaver did something weird that screwed up notify in other clients when i tried it.i think you're right about it sending ISON for open chats
[04:01:41] <XrD> Test
[04:01:53] <CoreISP> Oh there it goes, its just extremely slow 
[04:02:21] <gothkat> That was a while ago. last time i got a new phone before covid. lots could have changed by now
[04:03:14] <CoreISP> What's odd is. This user I'm talking with now is connected directly to Libera using Textual. But the users connected through ZNC seem to have a significant delay when *sending* something to the channel or trying to join a channel. *Receiving* messages goes in real-time. 
[04:03:34] <CoreISP> gothkat: Alright, hmm... It does seem to function, so is it best to tell route_replies to stop sending me warnings or better use another IRC client heh
[04:04:00] <CoreISP> So when I send something through ZNC, it takes a while before it shows up here on the directly connected user. 
[04:04:47] <CoreISP> Thank you all for your patience by the way and the many questions =D 
[04:05:35] <gothkat> There isn't really a rule that says a client can't send ison for whatever. the problem without route replies is that Hexchat will see an ison reply and think everyone is offline
[04:07:50] <gothkat> ideally znc would give a positive reply to ison to a *modules nick but... it shouldn't really make any difference. 
[04:10:12] <XrD> "If you receive "This module hit a timeout. This is a BUG!" in a query from *route_replies, please report this to the devs. If you know what caused this, this bug is quite easy to fix." Heh 
[04:10:12] <MetaNova> um
[04:10:13] <MetaNova> hmm
[04:10:18] <MetaNova> this reminds me of a certain module
[04:10:29] <MetaNova> [[Modules_online]] maybe? might be helpful
[04:10:29] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Modules_online
[04:10:49] <MetaNova> yup!!
[04:10:50] <MetaNova> "This module fakes the online status of ZNC-*users, so that ISON and WHOIS commands to *status e.g. return something that makes the IRC client believe the user is online."
[04:10:58] <MetaNova> CoreISP: load *modules_online
[04:11:01] <CoreISP> so if I enable that it ought to be problem solved?
[04:11:01] <MetaNova> that should fix your issue
[04:11:10] <MetaNova> I think so, at least, yes.
[04:11:11] <CoreISP> Alrighty let's have a look

[04:13:22] <MetaNova> sorry that I didn't think of it sooner, I've never had a need for it myself
[04:14:37] <CoreISP> Ok the delay issue is caused by Palaver, there's a 40 second delay when sending anything from Palaver; whilst receiving is real-time. wtf.jpg
[04:15:11] <MetaNova> huh
[04:15:25] <MetaNova> I have no immediate insights on that
[04:15:33] <CoreISP> Test
[04:15:52] <CoreISP> ^ sent that message at exactly the same time from Palaver (user XrD). We'll have to wait a bit for it to arrive, heh. Really weird.
[04:16:17] <MetaNova> if I were dealing with a client connected through ZNC where there was such an enormous delay, I'd be tempted to put either the client or the ZNC instance into raw/debug mode
[04:16:20] <CoreISP> MetaNova: I'm afraid it didn't sort the problem
[04:16:22] <MetaNova> to try to see what was going on
[04:16:25] <gothkat> i hated irc from my phone so i gave up pretty quickly 
[04:16:33] <MetaNova> CoreISP: aw. did you reconnect your client to ZNC?
[04:16:49] <MetaNova> the *modules_online module might not take effect until a new ISON list is created
[04:16:51] <MetaNova> (just a guess)
[04:17:17] <gothkat> Is there a ison list? i thought it is just a command/reply without state? dunno how the module works of course
[04:17:33] <MetaNova> well, "list" being what the client wants to query ISON against
[04:17:41] <XrD> Test
[04:17:42] <CoreISP> lol I guess the message sent through Palaver never arrives if I disconnect it *before* it finally ends up sending it xD 
[04:17:47] <CoreISP> Oh it does there it is :')

[21:13:08] <ColdKeybo[a]rd> I tried adding irc.libera.chat with 6697 as well as +6697 and both of them don't work. First complained about (SASL access only) then Disconnected from IRC (Connection reset by peer). Reconnecting...
[21:13:11] <andreas303> ColdKeybo[a]rd: I had issues with it today.
[21:14:13] <Byteflux> ColdKeybo[a]rd: "SASL only" is when Libera doesn't trust the IP you're connecting from, so it requires that you authenticate with SASL before you can continue.
[21:14:46] <Byteflux> I assume you're trying to run ZNC from a VPS or similar, the IP range has possibly been restricted by a SASL requirement due to abuse.

[22:20:46] <ColdKeybo[a]rd> Are you guys using SSL (+6697) or just 6697?
[22:21:07] <chymera> hi guys, sorry to ask this again, but how do I add a server when I use ZNC? I found out a few weeks ago but forgot again, it was only half explained on a page on the ZNC wiki but now I can't find it :(
[22:22:44] <ColdKeybo[a]rd> chymera You can /query *status help and it will list commands
[22:23:15] <ColdKeybo[a]rd> addserver is the command you are most likely looking for ie. "addserver irc.network.com port"
[22:23:43] <Ramses> ColdKeybo[a]rd +6697 is the way
[22:24:15] <ColdKeybo[a]rd> Ramses do you need any additional modules for ssl loaded?

So all normal until here. The "strange" behaviour was that it was going to continue asking me for it. I didnt flag "remember this choice" and while loding page browser continued to require me to signin with a cert
[23:46:19] <DoctorD90> the loop ended when i just flag it. So is it normal? or maybe multiple things on the page start to ask for it?
