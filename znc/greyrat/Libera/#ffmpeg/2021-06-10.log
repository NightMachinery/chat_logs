[01:21:30] <JEEB> yea it seems like it only gets set by the wrapper if it's >= 0
[01:21:41] <JEEB>         if (ctx->row_mt >= 0)
[01:21:42] <JEEB>             codecctl_int(avctx, VP9E_SET_ROW_MT, ctx->row_mt);
[01:22:02] <kiroma> So essentially defaults to false
[01:22:10] <JEEB> so in other words, it defaults to whatever libvpx itself defaults to
[01:22:19] <JEEB> it doesn't set it either way, unless you specifically set it
[01:22:25] <kiroma> Oh, I see
[01:22:30] <JEEB> (to true or false)
[01:24:41] <kiroma> "non-deterministic multithreading"?
[01:25:06] <kiroma> Sounds like data races
[01:25:46] <BtbN> It's just not deterministic anymore
[01:25:52] <JEEB> x264's rate control is also non-deterministic with multithreading if you set maxrate+bufsize
[01:26:24] <JEEB> but yea, something depends on which exact frames got done in which order in libvpx's rate control, I guess?
[01:26:44] <kiroma> Oh okay
[01:27:17] <JEEB> or whatever row-mt causes being done :)
[01:27:37] <JEEB> sounds like tiles
[01:30:33] <kiroma> Looks like it defaults to false inside of libvpx

[10:32:44] <Terrence> Anyone know how I can create a C# wrapper using one of FFMPEG's filters?
[10:33:37] <kohlrak> Terrence I'm not too familiar with C#, but you'd simply want to look into the C interface and how you import that into C#.
[10:33:54] <kohlrak> most languages do have a way to do this
[10:34:19] <Terrence> Where can I find the C interface?
[10:36:51] <kohlrak> https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html under "libraries documentation"
[10:37:00] <kohlrak> never did it myself, but that's almost certainly the way to go
[10:39:33] <Terrence> Thank you so much
[10:40:00] <kohlrak> You'll also likely need to look into "calling unmanaged code in C#" if you've never done that before.
[10:40:25] <JEEB> there's also examples in the repo under doc/examples. libavfilter has two APIs: one is where you can specifically connect filter contexts to each other in a chain, and I think the one that's shown in examples and utilized in ffmpeg.c etc is the one where you take in a string which is a description of a filter chain, and then libavfilter tries to build that chain
[10:40:35] <kohlrak> i recommend trying things like printf, scanf, etc before ffmpeg just for practice
[10:40:56] <JEEB> `site:ffmpeg.org doxygen trunk libavfilter` is probably a good spot to search with keywords
[10:41:47] <JEEB> https://lists.ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/group__lavfi.html etc
[10:42:01] <Terrence> JEEB are you saying I can just run an API to return the output for me?
[10:42:10] <Terrence> if so that would be a lot easier

[22:54:45] <bencc1> is it possible to change frame rate without re-encoding?
[22:55:03] <bencc1> I have a file with variable frame rate which I want to change to stable 25fps
[22:55:23] <bencc1> is it possible to drop and duplicate packets without decoding&encoding?
[22:56:09] <JEEB> not really since you most often have some inter dependencies. retiming in theory is possible and there's an initial patch for doing that in ffmpeg.c, but the problem ended up being... b-frames
[22:57:18] <bencc1> I'm trying to mix several videos with variable frame rate
[22:57:22] <JEEB> since with b-frames you not only have to take a frame rate and re-time each packet, but also look at the delay flag(s) of the bit stream
[22:57:31] <DeHackEd> mix how?
[22:57:33] <bencc1> I could use the xstack plugin but I need to change the inputs dynamically
[22:57:38] <bencc1> create a mosaic
[22:57:44] <DeHackEd> any use of filters requires reencoding
[22:58:02] <bencc1> so I'm building a libav* app
[22:58:26] <JEEB> in that case just decode and handle the frame rate post-decoding
[22:58:27] <bencc1> is there something that gives me constant frame rate from a stream with variable frame rate?

[22:58:42] <JEEB> there is the fps filter if that's what you want
[22:58:45] <DeHackEd> there is an fps or setfps filter... forget the exact name
[22:59:07] <bencc1> better to use this filter or maybe drop and duplicate frames myself?
[22:59:22] <DeHackEd> the filter will do that work for you
[22:59:41] <JEEB> the only problem with the filter is that if you get no frames
[22:59:43] <bencc1> good. I can also combine it with a resize filter that I'll need anyway
[22:59:54] <JEEB> it will only return something after you get your next frame
[23:00:01] <bencc1> ok
[23:00:02] <JEEB> that's a general thing with libavfilter
[23:00:07] <JEEB> it doesn't take into account real life time
[23:00:09] <bencc1> maybe that's a problem in my case
[23:00:39] <bencc1> I wish I could change the filtergraph (xstack) dynamically few times over the run
[23:00:42] <DeHackEd> if your inputs are variable fps, there could be "fun" involved in figuring out which input wants more feed
[23:00:44] <JEEB> if you are dealing with live inputs, maybe just keep a buffer of the latest decoded frame?
[23:00:57] <JEEB> and then at each XYZ seconds pass all frames into your stacking
[23:01:03] <JEEB> well, not seconds but frame rate or something
[23:01:03] <bencc1> yes, I'll probably keep the last frame
[23:01:16] <bencc1> yes, that's what I'm planning to do
[23:01:26] <JEEB> that way you don't really care about the frame rate in that sense
[23:01:45] <JEEB> you just keep replacing the frames with the latest one as the streams get input
[23:01:53] <bencc1> true. the stacking will take the last frame of each input every X time
[23:01:58] <bencc1> right
[23:01:59] <JEEB> and at each XYZ ms you create a mosaic
[23:02:15] <bencc1> it's not real time though
[23:02:22] <bencc1> it should run as fast as possible
[23:02:27] <bencc1> but I get the idea
[23:03:18] <JEEB> if it's not real time then the buffering until next isn't such a big problem, I think?
[23:03:28] <JEEB> well, it can be but at least you're not missing live output
[23:04:03] <JEEB> with live the problem is that if you lose input for a few seconds and are using a filter that will wait for the next frame to figure out if it needs to duplicate or drop or whatever
[23:04:14] <JEEB> you will not have output at all for those few seconds
[23:04:19] <JEEB> since the filter chain is not getting any input
[23:04:21] <bencc1> right. it's just a matter of deciding "when" to print the next stacked frame
[23:04:28] <JEEB> this is not a problem if you're not doing live

[23:11:48] <kepstin> my plan was to make a filter that takes N inputs, has a parameter for output video size, and internally uses swscale to resize the input videos so they all fit tiled into the output (including the ability to have videos be added/removed based on start/end timestamps).
[23:12:04] <kepstin> frame sync plan was to send an output frame whenever any of the inputs updates - putting an fps filter on each input before sending to this filter would be optimal.
[23:12:42] <bencc1> similar to what I'm trying to do
[23:12:48] <bencc1> but seems like a huge project
[23:12:52] <kepstin> i've honestly only got the format negotiation and swscale initialization done so far, heh
[23:13:12] *** Quits: floor-hihan (~user@b29be7d2.rev.stofanet.dk) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:14:15] <kepstin> i currently use a ruby script that generates a really nasty ffmpeg filter pipeline and encodes video in segments as inputs are added and removed. but it works well enough for the time being.

[23:14:40] <bencc1> if you have a change after 2 minutes
[23:14:46] <bencc1> change in layout
[23:15:05] <bencc1> you create first video for 0-2min and another for 2min-X?
[23:15:44] <kepstin> yes, and then generate a playlist as input to the concat format for the final mux that combines the audio.
[23:16:08] <bencc1> that works well if you have a small number of layout changes
[23:16:33] <kepstin> we... have a lot of layout changes :/
[23:16:39] <kepstin> it works well enough.
[23:16:40] *** Joins: Flabb (~Flabb@89.169.84.117)
[23:16:45] <bencc1> but every time you have a change and you start a new segment, you need to skip all inputs to the correct frame
[23:16:51] <bencc1> doesn't it kill performance?
[23:17:06] <kepstin> seeking in indexed input files is fast enough that it hasn't been an issue
[23:17:21] <bencc1> what is indexed input files?
[23:17:47] <kepstin> most video file formats have an index in them that allows quickly finding the spot in the file which corresponds to a particular timestamp.
[23:17:50] <bencc1> for each segment you use xstack with the ffmpeg command line?
[23:18:10] <kepstin> this code predates xstack, it's using hstack and vstack :)
[23:18:36] <bencc1> how do you make sure segments continue seamlessly?
[23:20:27] <kepstin> actually, it's public open source, if you're up to reading some long-winded ruby. https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/develop/record-and-playback/core/lib/recordandplayback/edl/video.rb
[23:21:09] <kepstin> not doing anything special, if there was a re-layout then the videos all jump around anyways. but I haven't seen issues even when there was no re-layout, so it seems fine.
[23:21:22] <bencc1> nice
[23:21:28] <bencc1> I'll ready it. thanks
