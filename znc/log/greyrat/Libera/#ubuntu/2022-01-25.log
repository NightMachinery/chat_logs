[00:02:29] <pycurious> I've a new machine (30L Desktop) from HP. How do I boot it in Ubuntu. Currently it just boots in windows - doesnt do anything if a usb is plugged in or not.
[00:02:46] <pycurious> Do I have to do some safeboot enablement + UEFI Bios changes to boot from usb?

[00:03:42] <pycurious> matsaman: It does go inside boot - but it seems HP has very few things I can change inthe boot menu
[00:03:52] <pycurious> F10 takes me to bios
[00:04:08] <matsaman> in the "bios" you could also look for boot order, and what is allowed/disallowed for booting
[00:04:10] <pycurious> What exact UEFI changes does one need to do? Do I want to disable UEFI?
[00:04:29] <matsaman> you can't really disable UEFI, but if you see an option for "legacy" boot mode, that could potentially help you
[00:04:37] <matsaman> although it could confuse your Windows install

[00:47:05] <justaj[m]> hello, when will the next chromium update be available in the 18.04 repos? I'm usually not in a hurry or anything but I'm trying to get a certification for something and the online learning platform is dependent on drag&drop, which is currently broken: https://old.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/s8wh0a/anyone_else_cant_move_chromium_tabs_after_latest/

[00:49:34] <tomreyn> justaj[m]: i can't answer your original question, but you could try the snap instead
[00:49:41] <sarnold> justaj[m]: you could try grabbing older versions from launchpad, https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+source/chromium-browser , and see if that helps out. it'll trade risks of fixed security bugs being exploited against the feature break..
[00:49:44] <matsaman> or a different browser
[00:51:09] <justaj[m]> matsaman: I tried FF but I think since I'm blocking Canvas elements the learning platform also breaks there.

[01:04:40] <rdr> Brave has some quirks, it's Chrom(e,ium) with some features added/removed.  It's controversial for having an adblock by default, but I install ublock Origin to block more stuff.  It also compensates creators by allowing you to automatically or manually "tip" creators using cryptocurrency gained from voluntarily viewing ads through the optional Brave Rewards program, which I don't use

[04:18:34] <matsaman> juno__: I doubt it will go anywhere, but you can back it up by copying it from /boot/ to elsewhere if you want
[04:18:41] <juno__> Ok
[04:18:46] <matsaman> should be relatively small files
[04:19:00] <matsaman> what I would probably do next, if I were you, if I had the time right now is
[04:19:09] <matsaman> try a newer kernel version than the one you ended up on that didn't work
[04:19:13] <matsaman> sometimes regressions just get fixed
[04:19:26] <juno__> Would I need to download and install the kernel?
[04:19:33] <matsaman> if that doesn't work, you might have to compare the kernels and see what changed
[04:20:12] <matsaman> in some manner, yes
[04:20:28] <matsaman> unless there is an Ubuntu-specific archive for a more recent version of Ubuntu you could use

[04:21:06] <juno__> Thank you as well tomreyn and Maik
[04:21:11] <matsaman> it does take a certain amount of time usually on the order of 5-20 minutes to compile, depending on how many things you enable
[04:21:51] <matsaman> juno__: does 'zcat /proc/config.gz | head' produce output?
[04:22:17] <matsaman> juno__: if so you can use 'zcat /proc/config.gz | tee some/file.txt' to backup the current kernel's config

[08:59:12] <canurabus> Is there any way to upgrade an EOL version of Ubuntu (non LTS?). I have groovy and would like to avoid reinstalling everything. It doesn't seem to work with `do-release-upgrade`. How do offline upgrades work? I'm trying to find a way to go from groovy -> hirsute -> impish. If I boot with a hirsute ISO will I be able to upgrade my existing install?

[09:00:06] <ubottu> canurabus: End-Of-Life is when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop. Make sure to update Ubuntu before it goes EOL so you get updates promptly for newly-discovered security vulnerabilities. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOL and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more info. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[09:00:41] <Bashing-om> canurabus: ^ short answer - yes.
[09:01:28] <JackFrost> But don't skip versions in the meantime, the upgrade path can be painful.

[10:41:11] <gombara> hello. I have been trying to automate install of Ubuntu 21.10 desktop. All the information I could found online points to modifying grub.cfg to provide command line options to kernel. but for some reason I could not get it working. after the boot it lands in live session desktop instead of starting the install. any ideas?

[10:47:18] <alkisg> Hello! I have two NICs; one gets a proper IP and the other one doesn't, on purpose. My problem is that `NetworkManager-wait-online.service` is in failed state.
[10:47:18] <alkisg> Can I somehow tell network-manager that one connection to the Internet is enough, and that it doesn't need all connections to start before I'm "online"?
[10:48:07] <alkisg> This in turn is causing other issues, like systemctl status saying "degraded state", openssh-server delaying its start etc

[11:01:13] <alkisg> @ravage thanks; unfortunately that would mean that I'd have to create a connection for all interfaces in all my servers that are e.g. connected by mistake to a vlan and don't receive an IP from that interface
[11:01:21] <alkisg> I.e. I'd prefer some solution where I wouldn't have to list any interfaces
[11:01:46] <ravage> and what do you need the service for? i dont use it on any of my servers
[11:02:30] <alkisg> Some services depend on nm-online state; so e.g. openssh-server just starts later, and I think some may even not get started at all because of this
[11:02:54] <alkisg> Depending on if they declared 'After' or 'Requires'...
[11:03:39] <ravage> you could just change ExecStart to /bin/true then ;)
[11:04:41] <alkisg> That would make services start before an IP/DNS exist; so they might do the wrong thing
[11:05:00] <ravage> depends on the services of course yes
[11:05:02] <alkisg> Omitting the -s works fine, but I'm worried why it's not the default...

[12:14:47] <ogra> Kilos, and why would  swapfile be better ? alkisg's claim stands, they both d the same thing and sit at the same location for their lifetime ... it would only help if you re-created the swapfile at each boot ...
[12:15:13] <ogra> else they are effectively the same
[12:15:49] <Kilos> ogra  I just follow what the clever people say
[12:16:23] <Kilos> there is a difference I am sure. my ssd is now 3 years old and still working fine
[12:17:34] <Kilos> and it was a second hand windows drive that crashed to bad to repair
[12:17:43] <ogra> even with a swap partiton yur controller has wear levelling and will try o compensate ... it is true that swap shortens the lifetime ... but thats rather something like from 10y to 9y with modern SSDs... you will likely not hit the threshold before you switch to a new disk

[18:36:03] <ubottu> Liblx: Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.

[23:24:55] <morganu> question: what desktop environments are "real ubuntu" so I can get support here? I looked on the web and didnt find it (bad search terms maybe) so I ask. Mate? Cinnamon?  -- are there problems in 21.10? Am I pretty safe installing that? What are the advantages?. (2 questions in one)
[23:25:20] <tomreyn> !flavors | morganu
[23:25:21] <ubottu> morganu: Recognized Ubuntu flavors build on Ubuntu and provide a different user experience out of the box. They are supported both in #ubuntu and in their flavor channel. For a list, see https://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu-flavours
[23:25:28] <morganu> great thanks

[23:27:31] <tomreyn> there are certainly open bug reports and *some* issues in every release, nothing is perfect, or nothing is perceived as perfect by everybody. generally, LTS releases tend to get more developer love and polish than 9 month support life releases such as 21.10.
[23:27:39] <Maik> rdr: it indeed isn't

[23:29:39] <tomreyn> morganu: Newer Ubuntu releases come with newer software, but that newer software may also be available as backports or third parties on the latest LTS release. But you shouldn't expect non-LTS releases to actively harm your computer.

[23:42:04] <morganu> 2 april 2020. so they dropped some since 20.04 came out? I noticed 20.04 in the title Sunrise
