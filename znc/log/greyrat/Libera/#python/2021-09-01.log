[00:02:16] <bjs> rud0lf: broken pipe is a very generic error,  probably a queue got destroyed before it was finished or something
[00:02:31] <bjs> rud0lf: as for repeating forever that doesn't sound like something multiprocessing would do,  does your code have a loop in it?

[00:30:58] <raxor2k> and your suggestion is ?
[00:31:10] <bjs> raxor2k: i don't really understand how you ended up with random exercise dicts and what are these average dicts anyway and why do you want to merge them and how come your average dicts have two different values for exercise_ID 1
[00:31:18] <bjs> and 2
[00:31:29] <raxor2k> bjs: its from different tables in the DB
[00:33:04] <bjs> raxor2k: so, you read from one table into one list and from the other table into another list and then write some code to "merge" the two into a shared thing
[00:33:15] <bjs> raxor2k: why is that over-complicating it?  isn't that the simple/obvious way.
[00:33:32] <bjs> Isn't one of the benefits of databases to be able to do this stuff for you? e.g. SQL JOIN
[00:33:39] <raxor2k> bjs: i will figure this out myself, and i will send you over the code once im finished
[00:33:42] <raxor2k> and then you will understand
[00:34:21] <bjs> raxor2k: I recommend making little examples from this, make a blank file and some lists containing the average dicts and a list containing the exercise dicts and then write code to try merge them
[00:34:35] <bjs> so you can kind of forget about the rest of the code and focus just on the thing you're trying to do

[01:28:05] <MDP87900> a file decompressor
[01:28:30] <bjs> MDP87900: can't you just read the part of the file you want and then pass it to the BitStream object?

[01:51:33] <hodapp> what about it?

[01:54:39] <stewie925> just makes me feel like I don't even know half of python , which is not the case lol
[01:57:08] <InPhase> Big-O notation is mostly language independent.  It comes from the study of algorithm analysis and data structures.
[01:57:46] *** Quits: manti7 (~manti7@176.10.104.94) (Quit: WeeChat 3.1)
[01:58:06] <stewie925> so understanding the Big O notation makes me code more efficiently?
[01:58:27] <InPhase> Which also means you wouldn't normally pick it up just from learning a specific language.  But it's hugely important for designing efficient code that scales well.

[02:00:52] <InPhase> I did end up with a calculation running during my postdoc that was going to take 30 years to finish.  I decided to stop it a little early.  It would not have finished yet by now.
[02:00:54] <hodapp> it's a good idea to study up on what the asymptotic complexity is of some common operations - e.g. linear search of a list, binary search, common sorting algorithms, hash table, matrix multiply
[02:01:19] <hodapp> I doubt they'll expect you to understand amortized complexity, but they might
[02:01:24] <InPhase> I was doing some symbolic algebra that got a little out of hand and did not scale well.
[02:01:53] <hodapp> InPhase: it's fine, sometime when I was around 18 I wrote an algorithm that scaled with something like O(n^(n!))

[03:46:41] <gloin> Hey, I'm having trouble accessing a nested dict entry from a get() method. Here's an example of what works/doesn't - I feel like I'm formatting the query improperly: https://bpa.st/E5EA
[03:47:28] <gloin> The carat on the resulting syntax error happens right at the opening paren "get(device"

[03:49:18] <gloin> nedbat: so I just sort of lucked into it by choosing "name" as the first parameter?

[03:50:01] <gloin> At any rate, I really need to scope the interfaces.get to only devices associated with the instant device_id
[03:50:06] <nedbat> Gamara: with pytest you could use @pytest.mark.parametrize to supply B implementation classes
[03:50:58] <gloin> that whole bit about device['id] = host_id is mandatory as there can/will be a great many hosts with interfaces named "eth0" for example

[05:10:15] <midnite> if you don't have a use for 32-bit python, then maybe don't use it
[05:10:42] <blackop> i just wanna learn why separated versions
[05:10:43] <midnite> presumably, there are people out there who download and install it, and so they keep it as an option
[05:11:14] <blackop> i mean if i develop an app via 32bit, is it being 32bit app?
[05:11:24] <blackop> what is the difference technically?
[05:12:11] <midnite> I'd assume it's a version of the python interpreter that can run on 32-bit systems, but I may be wrong.
[05:12:55] <domhnall> blackop: it will still just be a python app
[05:12:59] <stealth_> 32bit is more of a limited resources and how much data can be processed at one given time.

[05:14:07] <stealth_> if your software doesn't use a lot of resources, it matter if its running on 32/64bit
[05:14:29] <midnite> also, I'd assume python is run on more than just people's desktops and laptops. maybe things like embedded systems as well
[05:14:36] <stealth_> *doesn't matter
[05:14:43] <blackop> i see
[05:15:04] <midnite> so those embedded systems could be old 32-bit devices
[05:16:02] <midnite> x86 is definiely not the strangest platform Python is supported on: https://www.python.org/download/other/
[05:17:15] <stealth_> blackop, also on 32bit you are technically limited to 4GB of ram (not that you will get to use it)

[09:49:33] <evidlo> I don't remember the details, but for my project it meant that I had multiple configuration files instead of a single setup.py
[09:49:49] <evidlo> it's been about a year since I looked at it

[11:13:16] <stealth_> deniska, doesn't the package-manager handle removing what isn't supported?
[11:13:26] <aphysically> right now I mostly stick to gentoo on desktop/workstation and debian on servers
[11:13:29] <The-Compiler> I think the upgrader asks you to disable PPAs, yeah - but it's been a while since I used Ubuntu
[11:13:35] <deniska> also '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages' is in the default sys.path of a python from deadsnakes which is… debatable decision
[11:13:47] <The-Compiler> btw I use Archlinux (or something)
[11:13:56] <aphysically> but I'm a bit unsatisfied with debian, I always find myself getting peeved with needing dependencies that are too new about 6 months before a new debian release
[11:14:02] <stealth_> deniska, o wow
[11:14:36] <aphysically> so I might switch to something with a bit of a faster release cycle than 2.5 years or whatever debian ends up with realistically
[11:14:49] <The-Compiler> as a developer of a somewhat popular Python project (qutebrowser), Debian and Ubuntu LTS are a pain, yeah
[11:15:21] <stealth_> rolling release are the best!!!
[11:15:28] <deniska> stealth_: so, imagine you're on ubuntu which uses python3.6 and have python3.8 installed from deadsnakes. You upgrade to ubuntu which uses python3.8. The package manager compares python3.8 version you have already installed to the version from the new release, deadsnakes is newer, so it keeps it

[11:23:09] <The-Compiler> theprophet: it's still an iterable, and there are ways to consume it without explicitly looping over it - for example, list(it) would turn it into a list (by iterating over it internally)
[11:23:12] <deniska> theprophet: for example you can do list(iterable) and it will construct a list with items iterable returned

[12:31:23] <desophos> hi, i'm having a peculiar issue with runpy. i'm using runpy.run_module to run a 3rd-party package's __main__.py, which uses subprocess.Popen to launch an executable. the issue is that the executable refuses to exit by any means short of a forced "end task" until my app is closed. my app needs to open and close this other exe during its operations. i was using subprocess.run with `python -m ...`, which worked fine, but bundling my
[12:31:23] <desophos> app into an exe means the python interpreter is unavailable. i know this is a niche and complicated issue, but i would really appreciate any clues! thanks :) relevant code: https://bpa.st/2GSQ

[14:17:40] <lericson> i would be fine with a factory or something
[14:17:59] <FunkyBob> you can, but I'll hate you for it...
[14:18:01] <Tat> Regex groups can kind of be typecasted. I mean if it matches [-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+(?:[eE][-+]?[0-9]+)? it's a floating point number. etc.
[14:18:09] <FunkyBob> why would you return an exception, instead of raising it?
[14:18:26] <lericson> because sometimes you want to return an error, not break control flow
[14:18:32] <Tat> def get_exception() ?
[14:19:11] <FunkyBob> i've seen this pattern encroach from other languages that don't have exceptions, or cheap exception handling...

[14:24:06] <lericson> yeah i would have upgraded but dependencies rely on old tensorflows and yada yada yada
[14:24:20] <stealth_> lericson, why not `Optional[Union[Exception, ResultType]]`
[14:24:33] <lericson> that means either you return both or None?

That way in my unit tests, I can write a mock "request" class that issues an expected response.

[21:25:15] <jaggz> Akuli, mefistofeles phy1729: So, I mentioned briefly what this is for, but in case you're wondering or it wasn't clear or you had me on ignore:
[21:25:21] <Akuli> jaggz, i would solve this by first making a function to find a prefix list of consecutive integers, like [2, 3, 6, 7] --> [2, 3], and then calling that repeatedly until i arrive at the end of the list
[21:25:49] <jaggz> I'm classifying audio samples at home.  Part of this process is to repeat a patient's voice so it will be more clear, louder, and generally audible to caregivers (in particular her aging mother)
[21:26:38] <jaggz> at present it accuratly, using a neural net, recognizes her voice, and I have it repeating her.  But now I want to clean up the audio, since I designed this to be ultra-convenient, so it just uses a room mic, which can be pretty far from her
[21:27:15] <jaggz> so this step is for noise reduction -- I want to automatically gather background noise samples and use those for the noise-profile

[21:27:22] <raxor2k> bjs: now tell me why this is not working? https://bpa.st/LRLQ
[21:27:25] <raxor2k> doesnt make sense..
[21:27:41] <jaggz> since my neural net already does classification, and already distinguishes between "noise" and "patient" and "other" (it does a lot more, but I simplified it right now)
[21:27:51] <jaggz> then I can just grab those noise samples and generate a noise profile from them
[21:28:06] <Akuli> raxor2k, you are looking for dicts that have the same primary and secondary id
[21:28:12] <Akuli> maybe that's not what you intended?
[21:28:26] <zware> raxor2k: As a general suggestion, using names that describe the object you're naming will usually help make the code understandable, to you and to others
[21:28:28] <jaggz> but for increased reliability, I want to make sure I get sequential spans of noise.  There are plenty of random 1-off misclassifications, and I don't want to suddenly call those things noise
[21:28:38] <raxor2k> akuli: yes? thats exactly what i want
[21:28:43] <raxor2k> merging the points together :)
[21:28:43] <jaggz> if there are multiple ones in a row, that's more reliable

[23:15:37] <Payam> bjs, this is my __init__ in the directory. So I want to log stuff in classes in the same directory. I only need to do a import logging and then logger=logging.getLogger(__name__) and start logging right?
[23:15:41] <Payam> bjs, https://bpa.st/Q7CA
[23:17:11] <bjs> Payam: so the way "real" libraries usually do this is that each file goes something like `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
[23:17:45] <Payam> yes. and it will pick up the setting in __init__ right?
[23:17:51] <user_> jinsun, this seems close, but I just gave a few lines from the dataframe, there are many more lines like these with different timing,  so for every sensing line, need to next 'done biosensing' asctime date

[23:21:56] <foo> matsaman: is that the primary value of set?
[23:22:01] <bjs> Payam: here's an example of doing stuff in a real library, https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/main/src/urllib3/__init__.py#L45

[23:22:53] <bjs> Payam: it by default has a NullHandler (do nothing on log) and the library exposes a function to install a "log to stderr" handler on the libraries logger(s).  Presumably you'd do something similar

[23:22:56] <grym> sets are extremely useful for existence testing

[23:50:59] <jinsun> user_: well you could just shift the whole thing down, and assuming that the first row will not have "Done biosensing" fill it with False

[23:52:11] <jinsun> user_: so change the second line in that paste to `df["group"] = (df.message == "Done biosensing").shift(1).fillna(False).cumsum()`

[23:59:41] <ioistired> are "".join(random.choices(string.digits, k=5)) and format(random.randrange(100000), '05') equivalent?
