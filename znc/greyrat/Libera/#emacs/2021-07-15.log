[00:00:50] <rpav> not sure never seen it
[00:00:59] <TRS-80> I was sort of half joking
[00:01:11] <TRS-80> but when you started to talk about touch hestures...
[00:01:32] <rpav> well this is for a tablet and this wm already like 85% works with some cobbled-together gesture stuff
[00:01:44] <TRS-80> I mean, it is being developed for smart phone interface, but I guess you could put it on bigger monitor, it it had some touch sensors..

[19:13:42] <loskutak> Hi, I have an issue with notmuch and its handling of drafts. When I save a draft and later resume editing it by pressing 'e' (notmuch-show-resume-message) and finally I save the draft again, it creates a new draft, so the drafts start piling up. I want to be able to create a single draft, which I can edit at any time without creating new drafts. Am I doing something wrong? Any idea how to solve
[19:13:44] <loskutak> this?
[19:13:45] <fsbot> this is to that as the other is to itself, selah.

[22:57:02] <TRS-80> Well just think about what you could see there.  Even if secrets are encrypted, you can see names of all acoounts, etc.  But this on your own computer so maybe I am overstating it.  I don't like it but maybe it doesn't matter.  At the end of the day, most important is understanding your threat own surface.

[23:00:54] <hoppity> technomancy: what "pass"?
[23:02:00] <grift> you do not have to name the secrets after accounts, also integrity is wider issue, not just limited to named of files

[23:03:25] <technomancy> grym: I understand; I'm asking under what threat model is that a problem?

[23:11:30] <grift> ie regardless if you dont have business there then you just dont get access for that reason alone
[23:12:19] <grift> phyiscal security is another topic and relatively a non-issue compared to online security at least for me

[23:13:17] <agra>  Just guessing but if pass used hashes of entries instead of entries, would this problem be half-solved?
[23:13:31] <technomancy> agra: sure, and then you wouldn't get auto-completion
[23:15:17] <agra> Yeah, auto completion is nice
[23:15:25] <ajak> and you'd have to remember paths beforehand
[23:16:00] <roxlu> I'm trying to set the font of a `org-mode-emphasis` element but with the same font naming I see a different font in Chromium then in Emacs. Maybe I'm doing something wrong when setting the font .. but not sure. Is this the correct way to set the font? https://gist.github.com/roxlu/5c334378ec4b15c75ebc4e8091bf2e27

[23:23:07] <mwnaylor> The `git config --global credential.helper store` hint helped. First time I tried a push from magit, I got the prompts. Values stored in .git-credentials. Was my old password, but I replaced that with the token. Killed emacs and restarted. magit push workd w/o prompt. Succesful response displayed in the magit-process buffer.

[23:56:41] <rdrg109> [Q] Let's say I start instrumenting a function with Edebug. Is there any way to know which function called the functino which is being instrumented. I am asking this because I have a functino and I would like to know which function is calling it.
