[01:53:16] <Spunk> but if you want confirmation
[01:53:18] <Spunk> use -c

[01:54:27] <TheDcoder> It only checks if the data which is being written is correct
[01:54:36] *** Joins: ugubok (~ugubok@user/ugubok)
[01:55:09] <slimefoot> rsync always compares source and destination, so with -c, it has to read the destination file as well to calculate the checksum
[01:55:29] <TheDcoder> "Note that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking a whole-file checksum that is generated as the file is transferred, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this option’s before-the-transfer "Does this file need to be updated?" check."

[01:56:36] <TheDcoder> slimefoot: No, it's pretty clear that the -c option has nothing to do with the after-the-transfer check
[01:56:48] <TheDcoder> topcat001: I hope not, but it's possible
[01:57:15] <topcat001> So to be totally sure, copy, unmount, remount and then diff? Dunno.
[01:57:28] <TheDcoder> I might end up writing my own copy program...

[01:58:11] <topcat001> haha I understand your pain. I have pretty bad OCD (not implying you do).
[01:58:34] <slimefoot> TheDcoder: I read that part more as a "rsync *always* checks the checksum as it writes the file, but not when deciding whether a file needs update, and -c changes that by forcing rsync to always read back the destination file" - basically what the first section in the explanation for -c says
[01:58:34] <TheDcoder> topcat001: I might actually have some form of OCD too

[01:59:10] <Spunk> slimefoot, that's why I suggested the use of -c
[01:59:16] <Spunk> it seems like what he is asking for
[01:59:22] <Spunk> is an after the fact check
[01:59:30] <slimefoot> yeah, to me it also seems like -c is what they want
[01:59:43] <Spunk> I don't know how else to help
[01:59:48] <TheDcoder> No, I think you are misunderstanding it, -c is only to determine if a certain file is to be copied over to the dest
[01:59:57] <TheDcoder> It's pointless when there's no file in the destination
[02:00:17] <TheDcoder> Spunk: Don't worry about it, thanks for trying :)
[02:00:18] <Spunk> so 
[02:00:21] <Spunk> you want it to check
[02:00:25] <Spunk> but not to copy
[02:00:30] <Spunk> if a target files does not exist?

[02:01:03] <Spunk> agreed

[02:01:48] <TheDcoder> slimefoot: No problem, thanks for the advice about diff, I didn't know I could use that with binary files
[02:02:35] <topcat001> diff is pretty fast to test bit perfect equality.
[02:03:08] <TheDcoder> ...the man page for diff doesn't even mention anything about binary :-/
[02:03:23] <Spunk> for f in /my/files; do diff $f /target/$f done

[02:04:45] <TheDcoder> diff isn't suitable for my use case
[02:05:25] <Spunk> yeah, cmp is better suited for byte by byte comparison
[02:05:27] <topcat001> diff will actually work, but technically that's abuse ;)
[02:05:56] <slimefoot> yeah, not sure why diff isn't "suitable" here
[02:06:16] <TheDcoder> topcat001: exactly, don't want it to actually compute a diff patch
[02:06:36] <Spunk> slimefoot, cmp stops whenever it finds the first byte that is different 
[02:06:39] <Spunk> diff will keep on going
[02:06:49] <topcat001> I think it makes no difference.
[02:06:50] <slimefoot> does that also apply to `diff -q`?
[02:07:06] <topcat001> You just want a binary retrun status

[02:07:57] *** Joins: LiaoTao (~LiaoTao@gateway/tor-sasl/liaotao)

[02:08:09] <TheDcoder> yup
[02:08:15] <topcat001> diff will also say "binary files differ" so clearly it works with binary files too.

[02:16:07] <TheDcoder> This was in reply to my question if rsync re-reads the file
[02:16:20] <slimefoot> yes
[02:16:25] <babyface> does anyone know how to change the login screen resolution?
[02:16:25] <TheDcoder> Thanks for quoting it, and as you can see, the answer is "no"
[02:16:34] <slimefoot> TheDcoder: yes, because you didn't mention -c at all
[02:16:47] <slimefoot> so the answer is for the default case, without -c
[02:17:04] <TheDcoder> slimefoot: they made no comments about -c
[02:17:07] <BrainDamage> it does it even without -c
[02:17:30] <TheDcoder> and they didn't object when I quoted the man page which says it's irrelevant
[02:17:31] <slimefoot> TheDcoder: but our whole discussion was precisely about using -c to force rsync to do pre-copying checking
[02:17:34] <BrainDamage>               Note that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking a whole-file checksum that is generated as the  file  is  transferred,

[03:20:13] <TheDcoder> The best way to keep up with "the news" is to subscribe to the arch-news mailing list
[03:21:01] *** Joins: ursatempest (~ursatempe@user/ginko)
[03:21:20] <gunix> yea guys. We have tons of servers running arch and they are on autoupdate. There is no time to read the news every day. if they crash, they crash. It happens only once per year and only 5-10 servers get affected before we find the issue. We fix it, and we add the fix to the automation and just restart the update process that picks a few servers per day and updates them
[03:21:20] <TheDcoder> Someone should edit the wiki to mention that, when I went through the installation guide only 3rd party scripts to fetch the news were mentioned
[03:22:13] <TheDcoder> gunix: Subscribe to the mailing list, and only read the news when there's actually news

[03:22:48] <gunix> TheDcoder: i will open a jira ticket for the devops team to subscribe to the mailing list :-D 
[03:23:06] <TheDcoder> I tend to prefer email as it's a good habit to check it daily
[03:23:37] <thursdaylark> the news posts are actually usually the *only* times where manual intervention is required, so it's basically required reading for every user
[03:23:39] <TheDcoder> gunix: Good, perhaps someone can write a script to open a new ticket everytime news is published
[03:23:56] <gunix> TheDcoder: that is actually a very good idea
[03:24:05] <thursdaylark> there are also pacman hooks that check the news for you and fail the transaction

[04:40:05] <et09> patience turns the mulberry leaf into silk 
[04:40:05] <ectospasm> Yeah, it can take a while if you have large disks.
[04:40:30] <ectospasm> You can use `df -h` to see which disk is near/at 100 percent.
[04:40:33] *** Joins: defragger (~random@i59F506AC.versanet.de)
[04:41:02] <ectospasm> And then instead of searching the root, do `du -csh /path/to/full/mountpoint | sort -h`
[04:41:14] <Elodin> ectospasm: it's the / disk
[04:41:36] <rcf> Elodin: it needs to stat() every file on the filesystem, so it will be slow most of the time

[04:42:18] <BrainDamage> ncdu will to it interactively and give you a nice sorted graph
[04:42:41] <ectospasm> Elodin:  OK, if I'm searching / with du, I usually do `sudo du -csh --exclude={dev,proc,sys,<any large disk mountpoint} /* | sort -h
[04:43:02] <ectospasm> I've never seen the one-filesystem option work very well.
[04:43:39] <rcf> Elodin: which also has the fun property of making it slowest for every full unit of disk space when dealing with the smallest files.

[04:45:18] <TheDcoder> I used gdu recently and it's nice and simple

[07:51:48] <noobaroo> I'm looking at the latest news on main page. I have a question. If I enable the mentioned kernel option, will my 4.19 kernel be able to utilize linux-firmware? I'm a little confused by the wording. I can't tell if it's just saying that kernels older than 5.3 need to enable the kernel option for proper function, or if it's saying that all kernels need to enable the kernel option but it won't work
[07:51:49] <noobaroo> on older than 5.3?

[07:57:35] <Scimmia> Right, but the option is only on 5.3+
[07:59:10] <noobaroo> Second question... 5.10lts and 4.19lts runs fine for me. But kernel 4.4lts freezes at KMS. I can only boot up on 4.4 with KMS disabled completely. Setting early KMS didn't help. Anyone have suggestions? 
[07:59:18] <gumbo> i don't know what i want in a distro, i use i3 so everything looks the same until i go to the command line its either apt , emerge or pacman
[07:59:43] <Scimmia> 4.4? Yeah, forget about it
[08:01:09] <noobaroo> Well, I didn't have proper linux-firnware installed. Could that be the reason for KMS freeze?
[08:01:09] <Scimmia> Looks like even upstream is dropping that next month. I'm actually surprised it even works on Arch at this point

[08:05:12] <Scimmia> Quoting Wikipedia won't get you anywhere
[08:05:39] <Scimmia> kernel.org is the actual upstream
[08:06:12] <Scimmia> and even if it was sticking around, I wouldn't expect Arch to work on it, anyway
[08:06:18] <espresso> gumbo: I came from slackware always-rolling-everything and arch struck a chord. dev station, server, desktops, kept that 'new boxes' smell even after 5 years with scarce any downtime
[08:06:34] <Ghosthree3> idk why you'd ever want to use such an old kernel? just use the latest lts if thats your thing

[08:08:11] <noobaroo> IDK either honestly, but IMO Arch's goal is creating the system I want exactly how I want it.
[08:08:12] <gumbo> nice espresso 
[08:08:18] <mpan> noobaroo: Wikipedia gives February 2022 as the end of 4.4 support. What you are quoting is a note, which mentions a separate project (CIP Core), which is willing to support 4.4 independent of the Linux LT.

[08:11:01] <Ghosthree3> if you want to use an old kernel (again why) ...sure, go ahead, but arch doesnt support that officially afaik

[16:45:56] <mexen> What's the community consensus on yay vs paru? I used Arch years ago (only yay existed then). I have been thinking to try out Arch in a VM and see if I should return to daily driving it.
[16:45:56] <mexen> So... yay or paru?
[16:45:56] <mexen> Thanks
[16:46:50] <Ghosthree3> both work, i think paru has a better future
[16:47:09] <alad> neither
[16:47:25] <alad> how many of those AUR packages do you use anyway
[16:47:41] <mexen> Ghosthree3: Oh, I see. Why is that, you reckon?
[16:47:44] <alad> phrik: give mexen aurhelpers
[16:47:45] <phrik> mexen: Do not recommend AUR Helpers before establishing they fully understand the process of using makepkg. Also read http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/04/09/helpers/
[16:47:50] <Ghosthree3> alad: pacman -Qqme | wc -l     34

[16:48:16] <GuiToris> 68, I win
[16:48:23] <mexen> alad: hm, back then, I think a total of around 6-8. I don't know about now because some may have made it to the main repos
[16:48:27] *** Joins: ghost08 (~ghost08@adsl-dyn-18.95-102-48.t-com.sk)
[16:48:32] <alad> mexen: have you considered using email notifications for those 
[16:48:51] <alad> then whenever one of your packages needs an update, you're notified right away
[16:49:04] <GuiToris> as a matter of fact, I thought I would have much more :/
[16:49:18] <alad> GuiToris: my record is slightly over 800
[16:49:23] <alad> it's not a win, only a loss :D
[16:49:24] <Ghosthree3> mexen: the primary feature developer for yay had differences with the lead maintainer with how they wanted to include stuff so made paru, they're pretty much the same now though i believe paru has improved on a few things at this point. for general installation and removal 99% of the time you wont know the difference though
[16:49:46] <GuiToris> alad, oh, I'm not even close
[16:50:09] <mexen> Ghosthree3: Oh, I see.
[16:50:42] <newuser> alad, is there any email subscription available for aur update?
[16:50:54] <mexen> alad: there was a tool I used to use for that... hm, it never notified me via e-mail but it showed what needed updates even from AUR
[16:51:03] <mexen> Final question
[16:51:12] <mexen> can yay and paru run side by side
[16:51:21] <alad> newuser: enable notifications on the website for an aur package should notify you on upgrades, yes
[16:51:34] <alad> mexen: do you know how aur helpers like yay and paru operate
[16:51:35] <Ghosthree3> yea they could but idk why you'd choose to do that
[16:51:48] <Ghosthree3> ^ the fact that you have to ask means you dont know what they do really
[16:51:58] <mexen> alad: their innards? not really, no.
[16:52:03] <alad> mexen: no, the basic principles

[16:52:51] <mexen> All right, thanks.
[16:52:55] <Ghosthree3> aur helpers are not like pacman, they dont keep their own db which tracks the installation of aur packages, pacman is responsible for that, they use pacman
[16:54:06] <alad> Ghosthree3: reminds me of some pathologic cases, which haven't heard of local repos, and make an sqlite db of whatever aur packages they built instead :D

[19:29:19] <cburgard> hey everyone, I'm struggling to setup my bluetooth headset on my brand new arch laptop. I'm using pulseaudio+bluez+blueman, and the headset is a Bose QC 35 II. I can successfully connect and pair with the device, but it doesn't show up as a card in pactl. I've searched the web, but everyone just tells me to restart bluetooth and pulseaudio, and I've done that multiple times now. any suggetsions?
[19:29:37] <mxbl> luigibu: yes, should work fine if you aren't running yay at the same time
