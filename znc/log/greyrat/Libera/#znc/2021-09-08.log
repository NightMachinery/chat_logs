[21:37:20] <Casper> You mean asking if anyone is here is useful? :p
[21:38:01] <DarthGandalf> Sparr0w: you'd be surprised how often people ask whether they can ask or not, without actually asking what they want
[21:38:28] <DarthGandalf> And re your question...
[21:38:39] <DarthGandalf> maybe noone said anything while you were away?
[21:38:40] <Sparr0w> All I said what hello and asked if anyone was around.
[21:39:01] <DarthGandalf> yes, and that by itself is not a useful question
[21:39:31] <Sparr0w> If you say so.  It was useful to me and you‚Äôve responded.  So, now I know that I wasn‚Äôt having connection issues. 
[21:39:51] <Sparr0w> It was similar to old radio check request.
[21:39:59] <DarthGandalf> see, the bot verified your connection
[21:40:01] <DarthGandalf> not me
[21:40:10] <Sparr0w> haha. I didn‚Äôt want to talk to a bot.
[21:40:18] <DarthGandalf> why not?
[21:40:54] <Sparr0w> because I like real people.  bots never help much at all.  I am familiar with some of the new chat bots for ‚Äúservice‚Äù systems, and they suck.
[21:41:22] <DarthGandalf> nah, ZNC-Linker is not like that

[21:44:10] <Sparr0w> I don‚Äôt know about it as I am trying to learn about znc.  I used IRC years ago. Didn‚Äôt even know it was still alive and I found it was and trying to get back into it.  I am trying to figure out how to take advantage of the buffer that is supposed to allow scroll back when one is away or offline, but I keep getting an error that the buffer is empty.  Is the bot going to help me fix the issue?
[21:44:45] <DarthGandalf> That's not why the bot is here
[21:44:47] *** Joins: stac (~stac@user/stac)
[21:44:53] <DarthGandalf> And no, it won't
[21:45:03] <DarthGandalf>  
[21:45:03] <DarthGandalf> [08 —Å–µ–Ω—Ç., 18:08:27] <DarthGandalf> And re your question...
[21:45:03] <DarthGandalf> [08 —Å–µ–Ω—Ç., 18:08:39] <DarthGandalf> maybe noone said anything while you were away?
[21:46:09] <DarthGandalf> you can disable auto clearing of the buffer, and you'll receive more of it
[21:46:18] <DarthGandalf> but then you'll receive the same messages again and again
[21:46:26] <Sparr0w> ok, then I am not sure why the bot is here.  No, I can see there are 83 messages according to palaver client in one of the channels, I try to issue ‚Äú/raw znc playbuffer #channel, and I receive ‚Äúthe buffer is empty‚Äù
[21:46:38] <DarthGandalf> so, you ARE connected
[21:47:07] <Sparr0w> Yes, I am connected.  I just can‚Äôt seem to view playbackbuffer or it is always empty.
[21:47:16] <DarthGandalf> if you saw these 83 messages already, what kind of playback do you want to see?
[21:47:20] <DarthGandalf> to see them again?
[21:47:30] <Casper> More and MORE of all the same. :p
[21:48:20] <Sparr0w> didn‚Äôt see anything at all.  Is it incorrect to think that ‚Äú/raw znc playbuffer #znc‚Äù would read back the last X lines according to ZNC settings in web admin module?
[21:48:36] <DarthGandalf> You said you saw them
[21:48:43] <DarthGandalf> But now you say you didn't see them
[21:48:43] <Sparr0w> no sir. I didn‚Äôt
[21:48:52] <DarthGandalf> Then how do you know you had 83 messages?
[21:48:56] <DarthGandalf> If you didn't see them
[21:49:23] *** Joins: chat (limnoria@user/metanova/bot/chat)
[21:49:29] <Sparr0w> The Palaver app shows message count, on a screen next to channel name, but not the messages unless one clicks into the channel.
[21:49:54] <DarthGandalf> so palaver shows empty channel?
[21:50:43] <DarthGandalf> If it shows that there are messages, but refuses to show them, that sounds like a palaver issue
[21:50:43] <knolle> try disconnecting for an hour
[21:51:41] <Sparr0w> just channel names and message count until one clicks on the channel.  Should, ‚Äú/raw znc playbuffer #znc‚Äù show the last 50 messages, regardless of client used with ZNC?
[21:51:54] *** Quits: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c) (Quit: :P)
[21:51:59] <DarthGandalf> by default, only if it didn't send them yet
[21:52:04] <knolle> if you're connected to it, it is supposed to show nothing by default
[21:52:06] <DarthGandalf> which it does
[21:52:21] <DarthGandalf> it will automatically show the buffer when you connect, and clear it
[21:52:36] <DarthGandalf> but you can try to <DarthGandalf> you can disable auto clearing of the buffer, and you'll receive more of it
[21:54:21] <Sparr0w> Is there somewhere I could read more about how the function should work?  That is good to know. Thank you.  How do you disable buffer clearing?  I read through the ZNC but it seems to just show questions to things outside of here is what comes with base functionality.  I am finding it difficult to start to finish simple to complex at any point in the wiki.
[21:54:23] <DarthGandalf> there is such command, playbuffer, but it's not very useful
[21:54:47] <DarthGandalf> did you use webadmin?
[21:54:54] <DarthGandalf> it has a checkbox in the channel settings
[21:55:04] <Sparr0w> which command is more useful to playback, just leave channel and come back later an watch the last 50 messages scroll?
[21:55:10] <Sparr0w> yes, I‚Äôll check web admin.
[21:55:23] <DarthGandalf> no, if you leave the channel, you leave the channel
[21:55:35] <DarthGandalf> if ZNC is not on the channel, it won't see any messages
[21:55:48] <DarthGandalf> but if you disconnect the client, that's a more usual use case
[21:56:02] <Sparr0w> Oh. knolle posted to disconnect for an hour.
[21:56:36] <knolle> you might get how it's supposed to work then
[21:56:46] <knolle> because i don't think you do
[21:57:28] <DarthGandalf> knolle: that sounds rude
[21:57:35] <Sparr0w> ok, so what is a simple test to verify that znc is operating with a playback buffer?  close the client and open it out hour later?  I was hoping I could force a playback to see if the buffer is capturing messages.
[21:57:42] <knolle> wasn't meant to be
[21:57:56] <DarthGandalf> make some other connection, and while you're disconnected, send some message on the same channel
[21:58:02] <DarthGandalf> e.g. from libera's webchat or whatever
[21:58:20] <DarthGandalf> then connect back, and see that message
[21:59:40] <Sparr0w> It comes off rude, though, it is correct, I don‚Äôt know.  I find that society is losing its etiquette with the advent of trying to communicate by typing. The written word is the hardest to master.  If knolle and I were in the same room, the body language and voice inflection would likely indicate truth.

[22:01:42] <Sparr0w> Thank you DG and knolle for responding.  I appreciate your time.  I will close this client and come back later and see if I can witness the znc buffer.  I will also try to turn off auto clean from web admin and see if I can try the playbuffer command again that way.  If there are any other tips or links that you feel might help me learn more about znc, I would appreciate that.  
[22:02:10] <DarthGandalf> Sparr0w: unfortunately, ZNC is only for IRC; it won't stay for you in a physical room with other people while you're not in that room
[22:02:53] <Sparr0w> Haha.  We have our znc-Linker bot for that.  He stays in the room and barks at real people.  haha.
[22:03:11] <knolle> the playbuffer command isn't really needed 99% of the time
[22:03:26] <knolle> you just get everything when you connect again
[22:04:01] <Sparr0w> Surprised znc-Linker bot didn‚Äôt say, knolle that comment sounds abrasive. haha. (no worries, joking here)
[22:04:34] <Sparr0w> Thank you knolle.  The default in web admin is buffer = 50
[22:05:25] <knolle> if you don't auto clear it, you will just get the last 50 every time you connect (you might have already rad them)
[22:06:34] <Sparr0w> ok. So, I‚Äôll leave autoclear on. Sounds good.  How is DG calling out my name with the yellow highlight, was that a direct message?  What is that command?
[22:06:52] <DarthGandalf> ?
[22:07:00] <DarthGandalf> that must be your client doing something
[22:07:04] <knolle> just type the nick, or tab-complete it
[22:07:31] <Sparr0w> ok. thanks.  Yes, Palaver is the iOS irc app everyone raves about.
