[03:14:35] <KevinCarbonara> Allie: the airtags look good, but do they only work with apple? Also, what's the max range? It looks like chipolo only works with bluetooth or something similar, and beyond that range, they don't have any effectiveness. Ideally I'd like something that could do both GPS and bluetooth (or some other closer range tech), but that's probably not available
[03:28:01] <superkuh> 900 MHz is line of sight.
[03:28:34] <superkuh> So, range is a function of what's between you and it in terms of buildings, valley, hill, etc.
[03:28:47] <superkuh> Most likely a couple blocks.

[03:55:12] <scara> also kinda like popcorn being poped in a microwave
[03:55:18] <scara> a mixture of those 2 sounds
[03:55:32] <joepie91> scara: toshiba by any chance?
[03:56:02] <scara> no, its seagate baracuda st8000dm004
[03:56:08] <joepie91> hm, not sure about those
[03:56:32] <joepie91> I have a toshiba that makes a ton of noise in normal use
[03:56:34] <joepie91> so it's not unheard of
[03:56:47] <joepie91> has it been doing this since recently or since it was first used?
[03:57:17] <scara> Ok, I'm just trying to be a little careful with my new hdd, I don't want it to die like the old one but to be fair it was good for a long while, like 2ish years
[03:57:35] <scara> joepie91: like since day one, I got it a few days ago
[03:57:48] <riff-IRC> 2ish years is good? no it
[03:58:06] <riff-IRC> 2ish years is good? no it's certainly not unless it was having the daylights abused out of it
[03:58:21] <joepie91> scara: right, if it's new then I would recommend running a full disk read/write cycle
[03:58:26] <scara> yea it has, almost always been reading and writeing to that disk
[03:58:33] <joepie91> and checking if there are any SMART errors afterwards
[03:58:37] <scara> joepie91: how do I do that?
[03:58:37] <joepie91> also, 2ish years is junk even under active use
[03:58:52] <joepie91> scara: I don't recall the name
[03:58:56] <joepie91> of the tool
[03:58:57] <scara> it was external hdd to tho
[03:59:14] <scara> gnome-disks is showing no problems with this disk
[03:59:57] <scara> hmm its almost silent now, could just be becuse it was in use?
[04:00:14] <joepie91> argh what is that damn tool called again
[04:00:20] <joepie91> scara: it will likely only make noise while moving the readhead
[04:00:29] <joepie91> ie. during I/O, especially random I/O
[04:00:35] <scara> Guess I'm just being paranoid
[04:01:18] <joepie91> badblocks! that's the one
[04:01:33] <joepie91> it has a write mode that will basically write your entire disk full of a pattern and verify afterwards that nothing screwed up
[04:01:41] <joepie91> note that it will wipe whatever is on it
[04:02:27] <joepie91> if the disk makes it through a full cycle of the entire drive capacity without dying or read errors and the like in SMART data, it'll be fine and the noise is likely just normal operation
[04:02:55] <joepie91> you'll want to run badblocks over a SATA connection and not as an external HDD, if at all possible
[04:03:27] <joepie91> (external HDD controllers vary wildly in quality and some are prone to causing read errors for no reason)
[04:03:37] <scara> already have alot of data in it, not possible to move it elsewhare. hope its just normal hdd useage
[04:03:39] <JTL> joepie!
[04:03:42] * JTL waves
[04:03:53] <scara> no bad blocks have been showen so far
[04:04:14] <scara> or "sectors" those are the same right?
[04:04:32] <joepie91> JTL: hi
[04:04:35] <JTL> sup?
[04:04:38] <joepie91> scara: yeah afaik
[04:06:01] <scara> I'm being dumb, smart is enabled and disks is reporting no errors, guess its just the sound thats weird for me
[04:06:20] <joepie91> scara: SMART data is not the be-all-end-all
[04:06:31] <joepie91> there's a reason I suggested badblocks in write mode :)
[04:06:52] <joepie91> when a HDD fails due to mechanical failure, noise is usually a precursor for physical damage caused by the read head
[04:07:06] <joepie91> and so the SMART data will not reflect the damage until it's too late
[04:07:23] <Peetz0r> SMART is not gonna predict that I'm gonna drop my laptop down the stairs tomorrow ;)
[04:07:24] <scara> Do HDDs come with warrenty
[04:07:27] <JTL> *BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT*
[04:07:31] <joepie91> the point of a badblocks write test is to go through a long-enough cycle that if something were fucked it would've failed catastrophically, before you store your actual important data n it
[04:07:35] <joepie91> on it*
[04:07:40] <Peetz0r> (fun fact, I don't have a harddisk in my laptop and no stairs in my house)
[04:07:59] <joepie91> so it's a useful way to check "is this noise a sign of impending mechanical failure, or just a poorly-designed noisy drive"
[04:08:10] <JTL> joepie91: Reminds me of a batch of WD Black 1TBs that were "normal" in terms of SMART data, but would go "clunk, at a certain interval, and dur
[04:08:10] <joepie91> JTL: am working on JS streams stuff
[04:08:15] <JTL> during use
[04:08:28] <scara> brb, lemme see if I can find online what hdds are supposed to sound like
[04:08:37] <JTL> Needless to say, said drives had a premature failure, and replacements of the same model but different batch were better
[04:08:48] <JTL> (in terms of noise)
[04:08:57] <JTL> scara: It can vary between drive models
[04:09:17] <Peetz0r> some hard drives are pretty quiet, but many hard drives make weird noises. most older hard drives make a lot of noises that can be terrible if you're used to modern solid state storage

[08:12:35] <KevinCarbonara> is this TPM 2.0 requirement for Windows 11 real? It sounds like any computer more than a couple years old won't be able to run Win11, but that sounds too dumb for Microsoft
[08:15:44] <rmmh> not just that
[08:15:53] <rmmh> they're saying anything older than 8th gen intel / zen 2
[08:15:56] <rmmh> won't be supported (lmao)
[08:16:16] <rmmh> AVX2 isn't _that_ good, guys
[08:18:24] <rmmh> but obviously this is a business-driven deprecation, not an actual engineering requirement. the beta builds don't require a TPM or CPU made in the last 3 years to run

[12:42:18] <evilgohan2> KevinCarbonara: technically, it's TPM 1.2. Also, apparently it can be bypassed by injecting a DLL from Windows 10. At least, for now. We'll see if that persists through the release.
[12:42:34] <evilgohan2> This TPM requirement is honestly dumb.
[12:43:06] <evilgohan2> It functionally cuts out the vast majority of the enthusiast / custom build market.
[12:43:22] <evilgohan2> Hell, even a lot of existing hardware will be rendered as "obsolete" by it.
[12:43:45] <evilgohan2> I'm talking stuff being sold right now - complete builds and laptops - that don't have TPM chips.
[12:44:01] <evilgohan2> sorry, modules.
[12:45:42] <evilgohan2> If I'm not mistaken, the only current usage is BitLocker. So, unless the position of Microsoft is that they're enabling forced encryption on all devices (which I *seriously* doubt given that it is Microsoft), the only conclusion that I can draw as the likely reason for this - particularly given the apparent requirement for Secure Boot - is that they're requirement for TPM 2.0 + SecureBoot 
[12:45:42] <evilgohan2> is for DRM purposes.
