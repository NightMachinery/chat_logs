[01:08:22] <bomb> hxx I'd like to say, yes. not as dynamic, but it's flexible and productive enough for scripting
[01:08:36] <bomb> you want to use Mono to embed, though

[01:23:19] <jonp> so after 2016 (when Microsoft bought Xamarin, which developed mono), there was an effort to make the BCL & higher level assemblies *identical* (-ish)
[01:23:30] <jonp> so that semantics would be *more* similar
[01:24:01] <hxx> Speaking of mono, how does the mono debugger and profiling tools compare to jetbrains dotultimate/rider programs?
[01:24:21] <bomb> you mean monodevelop?
[01:24:54] <jonp> i believe VSCode can debug mono apps

[06:08:04] <ravindUwU> Thoughts on the C#9 new operator? Specifically, it's usage as an argument to a method when the param type can't be inferred from the method name?
[06:08:42] <xsperry> what's the new operator?
[06:08:44] <ravindUwU> e.g. CreateToken(new() { ... }), where `new ()` actually creates a SecurityTokenDescriptor
[06:09:33] <ravindUwU> xsperry, you can omit the type name during construction, if the compiler can infer it, from C#9 onward :)
[06:09:40] <ravindUwU> List<string> s = new();
[06:11:55] <xsperry> that seems like it could be useful. how would the call look without the new operator?
[06:12:38] <bpmedley> ravindUwU : I really enjoy using new() when I feel the brevity adds readability.  I feel it's better than "var" everywhere.
[06:13:17] <ravindUwU> bpmedley, even to replace the object name in an object initialiser?
[06:13:51] <ravindUwU> `Subject = new(new[] { ... })` for example, instead of `Subject = new ClaimsIdentity(new[] { ... })`
[06:14:31] <bpmedley> I think I might prefer the later.  The one that specifies ClaimsIdentity.
[06:14:46] <ravindUwU> VS suggests that I use the former over the latter; I think the latter's a bit more readable, but then again, one wouldn't assign anything else to `Subject`, so the former doesn't hurt
[06:22:43] <ravindUwU> bpmedley, yup!
[06:23:27] <bpmedley> I will forget the type of new in that scenario and spastically mouse around trying to find the type.. :-0
[06:23:35] <bpmedley> that being the first scenario.

[06:54:05] <moose> I give exception to things like really crazy linq results or when type names are prohibitively long or equally confusing.
[06:57:07] <moose> The new thing is kinda cool for arrays in constructors. Makes it more readable I think, especially for some of the types like claims as mentioned.

[07:02:48] <xsperry> I use var everywhere if the method is small and simple (and mine usually are), so I think I'll like the new operator

[07:09:46] <ern> ezio: I hope you are nice to the cats. It's important.
[07:10:55] <ezio> Super, super nice.
[07:11:17] <ezio> Animals are innocent.
[07:11:22] <ezio> Sometimes they can be dicks.
[07:11:29] <ezio> But they don't know any better.
[07:18:30] <ezio> I actually had to separate them.  I've been watching a lot of that Jackson dude from Animal Planet just to make sure they were adjusting well.  Bonkers, I felt, was playing too roughly, even those she's the smallest by far.  She actually just got dewormed and first vaccines on Monday.  She and her sister.  And up until this morning they were play fighting and just getting rougher and rougher, so I'm doing a four-day break for Bonkers and then a careful
[07:18:30] <ezio> reintroduction according to Jackson.  And already it's having immensely-positive results.  The other two cats are starting to not ignore each other so much.  They just didn't care, but now they're playing a bit.  It's like a soap opera, but where they're mostly getting along and interacting well.  Hopefully Bonkers will be less annoying to the other two and thus get her ass kicked less.
[07:18:54] <moose> Humans are animals. I disagree that all animals are innocent lol
[07:21:12] <ern> Cat is important.
[07:22:11] <ezio> Technically correct.  We all have animal cells.  But we are very different in nature.  We are intelligent, and they are reactive.  So we are responsible for our actions.  You can't charge a dog with murder.  It doesn't understand how wrong murder is.  We can.
[07:22:22] <ezio>  
[07:23:47] <ezio> If a cat or dog pisses on the carpet, it's your fault and your responsibility to figure out why it happened and be there for your friend.
[07:38:18] <ern> Usually dogs with bad owners behave like shit.
[07:38:32] <ern> Cats tend to behave as long as litter box is clean
[07:41:20] <ezio> I clean regularly and I have four, one more than the number of cats, so they're happy in that regard.
[07:50:01] <ern> Good!
[07:50:25] <ern> I want to have a cat too, but not possible.
[08:03:42] <ezio> Happy and lucky to be in a no-pet-clauses-void jurisdiction.  Been 20 years since I had a cat.

[08:29:10] <moose> Humans are pretty reactive.
[08:29:21] <moose> There's no dispute in the scientific community that humans are animals.
[08:30:03] <moose> If we were so intelligent, we wouldn't be reacting to every situation every day. Each thing we do is for a now-need, not some magical future thing we're doing to head off issues. In the big picture, we're just reacting.

[10:22:19] <JakeSays> to say that we don't do things for the future is myopic.
[10:22:34] <moose> Oh. I didn't say that, though.
[10:22:54] <moose> I said we simply conduct ourselves in a reactive fashion, which is by necessity.
[10:23:14] <moose> That doesn't mean we aren't setting ourselves up for the future at all.
[10:23:29] <JakeSays> "Each thing we do is for a now-need, not some magical future thing we're doing to head off issues."
[10:23:33] <moose> Yes.
[10:23:40] <JakeSays> which is false.
[10:24:03] <moose> Give me one thing you've done which isn't for a now-need on an evolutionary scale for the species in the last 24 hours.
[10:24:31] <JakeSays> stuck $4k in a savings account.
[10:24:49] <moose> That's not on an evolutionary scale by any stretch of the imagination.
[10:25:18] <moose> The exception would be if that cash is dedicated toward paying for education for a child you are or have brought into the world, I suppose.
[10:25:21] <JakeSays> "Give me one thing you've done which isn't for a now-need on an evolutionary scale" - it's what you asked for
[10:26:01] <moose> I disagree. You put cash into a savings account and to believe that somehow this simple behavior isn't reactive is silly
[10:26:19] <JakeSays> what did i react to?
[10:26:37] <moose> Unfortunately I am not a mind reader.
[10:26:37] <JakeSays> absolutely nothing happened today that would cause me to save money
[10:26:48] <moose> But I suspect you're likely feeling pressure to have savings for retirement.
[10:26:57] <moose> Or perhaps for a specific goal
[10:27:03] <JakeSays> "I am not a mind reader" - right - so stop saying stupid shit that you know nothing about.
[10:27:09] <moose> Wow.
[10:27:12] <moose> Why are you so volatile?
[10:28:10] <moose> I think taking the comments personally is pretty crazy honestly.
[10:28:14] <JakeSays> "You put cash into a savings account and to believe that somehow this simple behavior isn't reactive is silly" - because you're claiming to be a ind reader.
[10:28:23] <JakeSays> *mind
[10:28:47] <moose> I am not at all.
[10:28:55] <moose> I think reactivity is natural and required for survival.
[10:29:11] <JakeSays> of course it is
[10:29:33] <JakeSays> but to say that saving money is a reactionary behavior is fucking stupid.
[10:30:01] <moose> Only if you fail to consider anything but your own perspective.
[10:30:07] <moose> And why you're so angry is baffling.
[10:30:15] * JakeSays yawns
[10:30:24] <JakeSays> that was reactionary.
[10:30:24] <moose> See ya, have a good sleep.
[10:31:20] <moose> I'd argue that you couldn't possibly have made the decision to save money unless you had an experience that indicated saving money was beneficial in some capacity, and reacted to it
[10:31:40] <moose> To have an experience and do something with that, is reactionary.
[10:34:26] <moose> ezio: To touch on your point about murder. I am not so sure we understand that murder is wrong but rather than we understand there are consequences. Different people also perceive things differently.
[10:35:58] <moose> And it's pretty well accepted that most animals know when a decision is wrong, including killing.
[10:36:26] <moose> There have been studies of animals that save other animals or let other animals die in situations they could assist in... even of varied species.
[10:36:40] <moose> Dogs try to save humans from fires pretty often.
[10:36:44] <ezio> I believe that we have certainly, exhaustively studied the philosophy of criminality, especially murder, and that we as a society agree that murder, more importantly rape, are heinous acts.  Animals understand that killing is wrong sometimes, but I would argue they don't understand rape very well.
[10:37:05] <moose> From a societal perspective, yes we have this general sort of understanding that murder is bad,.
[10:37:23] <moose> But that doesn't boil down to an individual person recognizing the moral aspect of that and saying "Murder is bad because it is morally wrong."
[10:37:30] <ezio> But humans can reason why rape is wrong.  We know it's wrong.  We feel it in our gut that these injustices cannot stand.
[10:37:36] <moose> It usually boils down, from the perspective if criminal psychology, to deterrent effects and social conditioning.
[10:37:53] <moose> Most people refuse to acknowledge that they'd be fine murdering someone for their resources if there were a guarantee of no social consequences.

[10:38:39] <moose> But in a double blind assessment of criminal psychology it was concluded that people with no criminal record and no history of violence are usually satisfied with committing murder if there's no consequences. Harming under another person's authority is also very common.
[10:39:18] <moose> There's been countless studies on harming under authority which were provoked by military actions that were carried out for the purposes of genocide.
[10:39:34] <ezio> I don't know.  I think humans are keenly aware it's not cool to murder regardless of the consequences.  And I think you might be putting too much emphasis on a small minority of retards.
[10:40:13] <ezio> I would bet, if you could look into the minds of most people, they would truly believe murder is wrong.
[10:40:14] <moose> Yes, people are aware it's not cool to murder, but is it a result of social conditioning or is it instinctive for survival or is it because of the deterrent effect?
[10:40:52] <moose> In governments with very little effective law enforcement, murder rates are substantially higher. That's not casual, because usually conditions are also poor in those localities but it's part of the equation.
[10:40:54] <ezio> I thoroughly disagree with that.  It's in our nature to abhor murder.
[10:41:10] <moose> ezio: I tend to agree with you, that instinct says lets not kill each other.

[10:42:39] <JakeSays> but it's more than murder. as a species we value life above all else.
[10:43:29] <ezio> I think in cases of genocide, it's often crowd mentality that causes atrocities.  But if was not in our nature to protect life, we wouldn't be so firmly on this side of the argument as a collective society in the first pace.

[13:26:29] <jmer> yesterday I bought new coffee... Thought I would try a "cheaper" brand so I bought the stores own brand of whole beans...
[13:26:45] <jmer> then when I get home and see the weight of the contents... It's 200 gr. bags of coffee...
[13:26:55] <jmer> so this is actually slightly more expensive than the usual coffee I drink >.<

[13:31:56] <jmer> kobo: it grinds the beans.... I mean... it fullfills it's primary purpose xD
[13:32:05] <jmer> So yes it's "good"
[13:32:30] <kobo> :D well idk but in coffee expers the grinder seems to be of utmost importance
[13:33:39] <jmer> kobo: I think the most important part is that you can change the coarseness
[13:33:43] <kobo> anyone have any experience with mulesoft, is it any good?
[13:34:01] <kobo> jmer, yep! but ive read that the coarseness can vary, like you still get some "chunky" powder instead of a fine powdered
[13:34:20] <jmer> The grinder I have can make it look like that pre-ground coffee you can buy
[13:34:29] <jmer> and it can make it really chunky (for french press)
[13:34:48] <kobo> cool. does it make a difference in taste vs just buying pre-ground?
[13:35:14] <jmer> I always buy whole beans... preground has a flatter taste
[13:35:32] <jmer> I even bought the same coffee beans, preground and whole bean and I think the whole bean tastes a lot better
[13:35:46] <jmer> same brand, same type etc. to do a valid comparison.

[13:52:51] <jmer> kobo: I'm more thinking that we would like to avoid a dependency to some kind of XML lib in our frontend...
[13:52:56] <planetcalls|work> jmer, use header to identify what client wants. A client might use `Accept` header to indicated accepted format
[13:52:59] <pandem> lol no one uses xml outside of .net
[13:53:28] <jmer> planetcalls|work: this is more like... they have a .net app, that wants to use chromium (or some paid derivative) to re-use our web frontend deeply integrated into their .net app
[13:53:28] <kobo> yep and it should be slower using xml as well
[13:53:38] <jmer> and they want to send params to and from the web frontend using XML...
[13:54:00] <pandem> does .net core automatically support xml for controllers
[13:54:07] <pandem> do you need to do something to make it work
[13:54:08] <jmer> I doubt the XML in this case is big enough to really be a performance impact
[13:54:18] <planetcalls|work> jmer, the situation doesn't help understand why xml vs json is of concern
[13:54:21] <jmer> pandem: the frontend is using Adobe Experience Manager...
[13:54:41] <planetcalls|work> if your webapp is hosted within a wrapper, it is still YOUR webapp!
[13:54:44] <pandem> no idea but doesnt sound good
[13:54:45] <jmer> planetcalls|work: because the people writing the application wants to send XML to OUR Frontend
[13:54:57] <jmer> and wants us to send XML back to them
[13:55:05] <jmer> and I want to tell them "no, you can get JSON" :P
[13:55:08] <planetcalls|work> so your webapp has a form on the page they want to submit to?
[13:55:16] <jmer> Something like that
[13:55:58] <planetcalls|work> if it is an API they are consuming within your application, they can instruct the format using the headers
[13:56:06] <jmer> they refuse to call any of our APIs
[13:56:08] <jmer> for some reason
[13:56:15] <planetcalls|work> you can use libraries to automatically convert response model to JSON or XML. It is inbuilt in ASPNET

[14:20:11] <moose> Oh my goodness
[14:20:22] <SKull> moose: i'm hoping to get my passion for it back after doing something else for a while
[14:20:23] <moose> I can understand, but surely the pay disparity is real between contact tracing and software engineering
[14:20:35] <Nasp> jmer:  Why do they call your js frontend?
[14:20:38] <Nasp> Sounds very strange
[14:20:44] <SKull> moose: i don't care about money.
[14:20:46] <blez`> SKull how are you gonna trace them? :)
[14:20:48] <moose> SKull: Fair enough then.
[14:20:49] <Nasp> SKull:  You quit your job right
[14:20:51] <moose> Happiness > *
[14:20:56] <jmer> Nasp: they are trying to re-use our web frontend instead of writing their own native WPF stuff (I assume)
[14:20:58] <Nasp> You can also become a tester, it pays well
[14:21:04] <Nasp> Corona-tester
[14:21:09] <SKull> Nasp: nah, they kicked me out.
[14:21:15] <Nasp> jmer:  And are they paying for this or?
[14:21:23] <Nasp> But i dont get why they call the frontend?
[14:21:24] <jmer> Nasp: Not sure... xD
[14:21:27] <moose> Nasp: internal customer it sounds
[14:21:31] <Nasp> Do they scrape the html or whatever
[14:21:43] <jmer> Nasp: they have stated they can't call API endpoints because we use API management... or some such nonsense
[14:21:50] <Nasp> SKull:  Does that contract tracing even work
[14:21:54] <Nasp> I think it's an easy lazy job
[14:22:23] <jmer> Nasp: they're not scraping anything, they're starting up chromium browser control that visits our page and have eventhandlers on that control that integrates with the javascript events.
[14:22:35] <SKull> Nasp: i guess in theory it works. but they don't have nearly enough people to do it right
[14:22:54] <kobo_> Nasp, I do think they manage to do a bit of tracing, where I live alof of people that worked as servers in restaurant/bars are now contatct tracers
[14:22:58] <jmer> They involved the home guard for contact tracing here because people just ignored the phonecalls xD
[14:22:58] <Nasp> jmer:  Sounds very hacky
[14:23:07] <kobo_> so it's kinda a job where alot of people who lost their living work with now until covid is 'over'
[14:23:14] <jmer> Nasp: yes I am not at all a fan of their approach, basically because it leaves a lot of work on our plate
[14:23:21] <Nasp> SKull:  From what i read a few months ago contact tracing had like traced down 10 people over a year or so
[14:23:37] <Nasp> kobo_:  Most servers are corona testers here
[14:23:52] <Nasp> Pays 5-6000 euro a month
[14:24:00] <kobo_> yeah, probably here as well
[14:24:15] <kobo_> wait what, 6000 euro a month for corona testing? where do i sign up
[14:24:17] <Nasp> jmer: So they reuse your frontend
[14:24:21] <Nasp> And add extra stuff no top?
[14:24:22] <bomb> that's mid-level sysadmin salary
[14:24:26] <SKull> Nasp: i really don't know the numbers here, or how effective it is. it's probably a drop of water in a bucket. but i could really need a break from IT, and this sounds promising to me
[14:24:38] <jmer> Nasp: something like that except they want us to create a slimmed down version without all the extra menus...
[14:24:48] <Nasp> But they are paying?
[14:24:53] <blez`> SKull so you test people with a swab waiting in queue?
[14:24:55] <jmer> I don't know who pays
[14:25:04] <Nasp> if they dont pay just tell em no?
[14:25:08] <SKull> Nasp: sure they are paying. i don't know how much though.
[14:25:08] <Nasp> But i would still keep it json
[14:25:15] <Nasp> But it sounds painful to support
[14:25:18] <jmer> It's not my decision whether we do this or not.
[14:25:19] <Nasp> If you change anything their shit will break
[14:25:24] <jmer> indeed
[14:25:24] <bomb> is corona tester b like tasting coronas, like wine sommeliers?
[14:25:31] <SKull> blez`: no. you basically call/text people who have been in contact with COVID positive people
[14:25:34] <jmer> Nasp: it will be brittle
[14:25:40] <SKull> blez`: and i guess you urge them to quarantine and get testet
[14:25:44] <SKull> *tested
[14:26:04] <SKull> i really don't know what it all entails yet.
[14:26:24] <blez`> never thought that's an actual job (or at least outside china)
[14:26:25] <moose> I wonder if it's fun to be told to quarantine. Maybe a little exciting.
[14:26:26] <SKull> but who knows, and the end of it i want to go back to IT, and that medical service company that i applied to maybe needs a dev then
[14:27:22] <bomb> moose in case Milla Jovovich in her prime comes to rescue you...
[14:27:30] <moose> I have no idea who that is
[14:27:44] <bomb> never seen Resident Evil?
[14:27:47] <SKull> or maybe working in contact tracing sucks balls and i'm about to shoot myself in the foot. but i'm trying to be optimistic ^^
[14:27:47] <moose> I have.
[14:27:50] <moose> I love that movie.
[14:27:57] <moose> Is that the main character lady?>
[14:28:02] <bomb> yeah
[14:28:07] <moose> She's pretty hot if I recall correctly.
[14:28:17] <bomb> your damn correct
[14:28:25] <moose> But I also thought Angelina Jolie was hot in hackers, and she is no longer attractive I found out.
[14:28:26] <Seng> I've had hot dreams of her in my younger days
[14:28:41] <Seng> The Resident Evil chick ^
[14:28:47] <bomb> I said _in her prime_ tho
[14:29:01] <moose> Aye
[14:29:15] <Nasp> On my 4th day trying to merge 4 lines of code with route changes
[14:29:18] <Nasp> Takes forever
[14:29:51] <bomb> she's also the cute alien in The Fifth Element
[14:30:30] <SKull> Seng: moose: it seems to me that #MeToo and all the feminist rants on the web for the last couple of years were all for nothing when i watch you two talk about actresses.
[14:30:33] <moose> Do like a real man: take local changes, commit -S -m "Making it all better", push --force
[14:31:05] <Nasp> moose:  What should that help
[14:31:07] <moose> SKull: Eh, why do you say that?
[14:31:21] <moose> Nasp: Less merging haha
[14:31:31] <bomb> welcome to the club hahah
[14:31:41] <bomb> you're being canceled by Skull
[14:31:47] <moose> I am usually the one cancelling people
[14:31:55] <moose> Calling out what's his face for being a racist ass
[14:31:56] <Seng> SKull, should I supress my decade own feelings about someone because of a #metoo campaign ?
[14:32:11] <SKull> moose: because there are a lot of factors to criticize an actor by. and you guys went straight to 'hot' and masturbatory fantasies.
[14:32:14] *** Quits: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:32:23] <SKull> moose: but by all means, go on. i'm not a woman. i don't have to deal with it ^^

[14:32:34] <moose> SKull: Ah, but here. I can provide an actual discussion about this.
[14:32:48] <kobo_> popcorn time!
[14:32:51] <Seng> I can't help what I feel and think, but I can choose not to act on it. So I can think she looked hot, as long as I don't go and grab her ass or cat call her.
[14:33:09] <moose> I am pretty educated about women's rights, about the struggle women have, all that. It's hard. I get it. But also, I am not educated about film or the qualities of actresses and actors. However, I can objectively state someone is attractive.
[14:33:12] *** Joins: csrf (~csrf@user/csrf)
[14:33:26] <moose> Simply saying that an actress or actor is hot, isn't oppressive.
[14:33:48] <Seng> I should probably stop calling my wife hot. She gets offended rather easily.
[14:33:50] <Nasp> moose:  But it is merged, just taken days to deploy
[14:33:55] <moose> If I went up to her in person and grabbed her ass and sexually assaulted her, that's a different story. If I went up to her face and said "You've always been on my to-do list if you know what I mean, loved you in Hackers" that's also terrible.
[14:33:58] *** Joins: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb)
[14:34:03] <moose> Nasp: Oh, that's even stranger. Why days to deploy? lol
[14:34:08] <SKull> guys, you really don't have to defend yourselfes. i'm just bored and made a snarky comment :D
[14:34:13] <Nasp> Because the pipeline keeps failing :/
[14:34:13] *** Quits: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:34:15] * Seng takes mooses hand
[14:34:27] <moose> SKull: I just saying you made a comment you thought was woke and actually your commentary is more harmful than either of ours.
[14:34:27] <Nasp> Flaky tests and all nd it takes like 1-2 hours to go through
[14:34:32] <Seng> Come on mate, let's watch hackers together and comment on Angelina
[14:34:37] <Nasp> And when it fails i ahve to start the run all over
[14:34:45] *** Joins: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb)
[14:35:08] <SKull> moose: i'm not even sure what woke means. so no, i didn't think my comment was woke.
[14:35:23] <Seng> Nasp, that sounds like my job. The development cycle is not very pleasant.
[14:35:53] <moose> SKull: You did, as you think you have some crazy enlightened perspective because you know the struggles worse. You wanted to make a point to show us all that you are involved, actively engaging and combating the evil doers who say anything slightly related to sexuality about a woman.
[14:35:53] <Nasp> Well we have the old monolith and microservices
[14:36:01] <Nasp> Microservives takes 5 minutes to run tests and deploy
[14:36:16] <Nasp> But the older shit, you end up using 1 week to add 3 lines of code
[14:36:38] <Diablo-D3> Wait, why are we talking about the sexuality of a woman here?
[14:36:45] <Diablo-D3> Computers don't have a gender.
[14:36:49] <Seng> moose, I think you can leave SKull alone now :) It's the internet - you can't (and shouldn't) win.
[14:36:52] <SKull> moose: thank you for assuming that i am that smart :D
[14:36:53] <moose> Diablo-D3: Some AI does, arguably.
[14:37:05] <Diablo-D3> AGI doesn't exist, and may never exist.
[14:37:23] <moose> Seng: It's not about winning, it's about cancelling people who try to do the cancelling for the sake of their own benefit because I truly believe it's quite harmful to gender equality in tech.
[14:37:24] <Seng> Diablo-D3, please address my laptop as 1001/0110, thank you.
[14:37:36] <Diablo-D3> And its probably a borderline hatecrime to even think they'd even *want* a gender
[14:37:45] *** Quits: bin101 (~bin101@user/bin101) (Quit: goodbye)
[14:37:45] <SKull> to be perfectly clear: i'm not mad at you guys, nor do i think less of you. i did just make a snarky comment. that's all.
[14:37:52] <bomb> Diablo-D3 are you saying computers are non-binary?
[14:38:04] <Diablo-D3> bomb: ... okay, that was a good pun.
[14:38:10] <moose> bomb: A+
[14:38:19] <Diablo-D3> Goddamnit.
[14:38:22] <moose> SKull: I am not mad at you either.
[14:38:27] <Seng> SKull, no bad feelings from me :) I disagree that we went too far, but I also have the approach in life, that it's okay that not everyone shares the same ideas of everything.
[14:38:45] <moose> ^
[14:38:48] <Diablo-D3> Im not even angry, Im impressed
[14:38:55] <moose> I mean if your views are insane, that's a different story.
[14:38:58] *** Joins: bin101 (~bin101@user/bin101)

[14:39:38] <moose> That's the second time someone has posted that in front of me.
[14:39:40] <moose> In like 3 days
[14:39:44] <Seng> <3
[14:39:49] <Diablo-D3> I'm going to say something I've said for years. If you get offended, you're the wrong kind of person.
[14:40:05] <moose> Diablo-D3: lol what
[14:40:22] <moose> I think that's so illogical is comical. I dunno if that's the intent, but it's great.
[14:40:25] <Diablo-D3> The problem with nazis is, if your solution doesn't involve pushing the entire planet into the sun, your solution isn't very final.
[14:40:28] <Seng> moose, only thing I loose sleep over disagreeing with on the internet is my own code :D
[14:40:46] <moose> Seng: I've gotten used to just dismissing people who are retarded and say stupid shit about my code.
[14:41:01] <Seng> can one dismiss oneself?
[14:41:03] <SKull> Diablo-D3: there's plenty of reasons to be offended about and speak out, but on the internet it's definitely of no use.
[14:41:09] <moose> I don't criticize my own code.
[14:41:16] <Diablo-D3> SKull: bUt My RiGhTsSsSs
[14:41:19] <moose> SKull: I disagree with you there.
[14:41:26] <Seng> ohh dear..
[14:41:37] <Babbage> anyone know how to get raw html out of a webview2 control? everything I read points me to string html = await Browser.ExecuteScriptAsync("document.documentElement.outerHTML;"); however the output is encoded html \u003Chtml> etc. rather than <html>
[14:41:48] <SKull> moose: well i'm glad for you that you don't have reasons to be offended then.
[14:41:50] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, generally from what Ive learned is, most people are just fucking garbage
[14:41:54] <moose> Seng: Oh come on now, don't expect me to rant about everything.
[14:41:57] <SKull> moose: and that wasn't sarcastic.
[14:42:03] <moose> SKull: I'm not offended by anything you say really.
[14:42:05] <Diablo-D3> doesnt matter what gender, color, religion, country of origin, socioeconomic class
[14:42:19] <moose> Diablo-D3: I can get behind that sentiment.
[14:42:49] <SKull> moose: i never assumed you were.
[14:42:53] <Diablo-D3> Its irritating, you'd think we would have all learned how to be better people by now
[14:42:58] <moose> SKull: Right-o there chap.
[14:43:11] <SKull> it takes a couple beers for me to actually say offensive things
[14:43:18] <moose> Diablo-D3: I think some folks have. But also the definition of "better people" is a little warped by society. Your idea if better is not someone else's probably.
[14:43:19] <Diablo-D3> Nope, entire fucking population is obsessed with tribalism until they work themselves into an early grave on things that don't benefit anyone
[14:43:34] <moose> Right now society seems to think that to be a better person is to side heavily on one extreme of politics, at least in the US.
[14:43:52] <Diablo-D3> moose: yeah, and I blame all of them for the current state of affairs in the US currently
[14:44:12] <moose> You either have to call everyone out about being racist, sexist, *phobic, etc (some of this is good, IMO, but a lot of it is insanity and people trying to be hip) or deny vaccines and science. There's legit no middle ground.
[14:44:13] <Diablo-D3> they won't just stand the fuck up and become adults. some of these people are 70 year olds in congress.
[14:44:30] <Diablo-D3> thats the thing moose, there is no legit middle ground
[14:44:33] <moose> People think I support radical right-wing extremism when I say I am moderate lol
[14:44:55] <moose> Or if I say I am constitutionalist, they have no clue what it means and assume I am amassing nuclear weapons in my house
[14:45:04] <Diablo-D3> I mean, if you're truly a moderate, then you're still allowing for extremism
[14:45:12] <moose> The thing is, I am not truly moderate lol
[14:45:30] <Diablo-D3> I'm extremely far left in my politics. People are downright frightened of me because I have ideas about things.
[14:45:44] <Diablo-D3> Literally, they freak out because of what lives in my head, as if somehow it can escape and get them
[14:45:45] <moose> But moderate in today's context means "Aligning with some of the left and right ideology in limited contexts", but I guess that indeed does open up for some extremism which I think everyone will follow into at some point.
[14:46:33] <Diablo-D3> the only extremism I will ever accept is being an extremist to extremists.
[14:46:53] <moose> An extremist left-leaning thing I believe in is absolute body autonomy (pro choice, but more) for example. I will disagree with anyone who says there's a good reason for the opposite.
[14:46:55] <Diablo-D3> not to make everyone a moderate, but to truly curb the actively hostile violent barbarians
[14:46:55] <SKull> the thing about ideals is, they usually only work out if everyone is on the same page. but i do think it's important to have ideals nonetheless, as long as they're treated as such: just personal ideals
[14:46:56] <moose> It's technically a radical view.
[14:47:11] <Diablo-D3> SKull: yes, I agree
[14:47:25] <Diablo-D3> and the easiest way to destroy a country is to have as many pages as possible. divide and conquer.
[14:47:41] <Diablo-D3> this a basic concept that people refuse to understand
[14:47:41] <moose> But at the same time, I am not going to say someone is a lunatic idiot for believing that people shouldn't use abortion/
[14:47:59] <moose> It's just differences in opinions. We have no clue what is best for everyone.
[14:48:05] <Diablo-D3> moose: the issue with that is... its none of anyone's fucking business and does not involve someone harming another.
[14:48:08] <moose> I think SKull said it more concisely. Personal ideals. We know what is best for us.
[14:48:24] <Diablo-D3> its maybe the most moderate political view I have
[14:48:25] <MatthiasVance> It's HOT.
[14:48:37] <MatthiasVance> 🔥
[14:48:44] <SKull> Diablo-D3: luckily i live in a country where the government isn't all mighty and out to get its people.
[14:48:44] <Seng> hey admin!! Over here!! If a too #metoo comment could spark this debate, can we get a mute on the channel now? moose mentioned abortion!!
[14:49:02] <moose> My goodness Seng.
[14:49:07] <Diablo-D3> Seng: you forgot your /s
[14:49:12] <Seng>  /s
[14:49:16] <Seng> whoops :=
[14:49:18] <Seng> :)
[14:49:33] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, I find it fucking amazing that politics in the US are polarizing an issue that doesn't fucking involve them
[14:49:40] <moose> lol
[14:49:59] <moose> Diablo-D3: Yes.
[14:50:01] <Diablo-D3> are you a woman? are you a pregnant woman? are you a pregnant woman having an abortion? no? then it doesn't effect you, its between the woman and her doctor.
[14:50:06] <SKull> Diablo-D3: if they'd be polarized about real issues, they run the danger of actually changing something ;)
[14:50:09] <moose> SKull: Which country?
[14:50:16] <Diablo-D3> SKull: honestly, thats one of my pet theories
[14:50:20] <SKull> moose: Switzerland
[14:50:29] <Diablo-D3> they're bringing it up now because they ran out of ways to divide the people
[14:50:30] <moose> Diablo-D3: Men are carrying children too, don't forget.
[14:51:02] <Diablo-D3> a lot of slowly-becoming-ex-republicans are getting vaxxes, wearing masks, drowning out the voices calling for violence, etc
[14:51:06] <Seng> isn't it switzerland where assisted suicide is legal?
[14:51:16] <moose> I think in Switzerland plain suicide is legal.
[14:51:23] <SKull> Diablo-D3: i have an issue with the whole 'they try to divide' and conspiracies in general. i've never heard a polititian that i'd deem smart enough to pull that off
[14:51:33] <Diablo-D3> SKull: you dont have to be smart to do it
[14:51:42] <Diablo-D3> its built into people, its called tribalism
[14:51:54] <Diablo-D3> too many people run purely on emotions, and have zero actual logic anywhere in their noggin
[14:52:06] <Diablo-D3> ZOMG THAT DIFFERENTLY COLORED DUDE IS GONNA STEAL MEH JERBBBBBB
[14:52:07] <moose> SKull: Well, Russia literally provoked the BLM movement in the United States - so yes there are threat actors trying to divide the nation
[14:52:12] <bomb> women are annoying
[14:52:40] <Diablo-D3> you know who stole yer jerb? the rich people when they shipped it to china during the 70s.
[14:52:46] <SKull> moose: not exactly @ suicide. we have assisted suicide, for people that are terminally ill and the only outlook they have is pain and suffering. but even then it entails some steps you have to take before you can drink the poison.
[14:52:58] <Diablo-D3> your job isnt yours, it isnt your property, you dont own it. it also doesnt define you who are and doesnt own you.
[14:53:02] <moose> SKull: Can I be charged with the crime of suicide if I commit suicide in Switzerland?
[14:53:20] <bomb> lol jail time
[14:53:21] <moose> Because in the US you will be charged post-mortem and your estate will be assessed fines.
[14:53:44] <moose> Your estate can even be sued after death by private people if it was particularly traumatic for them, like discovering a hanged body in a park.
[14:53:44] <SKull> moose: no. if you try to commit suicide and fail, they put you in a hospital for three days and make a shrink appointment for you.
[14:53:55] <Diablo-D3> then dont fail.
[14:54:06] <bomb> yeah nobody likes failures
[14:54:08] <moose> I can't imagine failing at suicide. It's really not difficult.
[14:54:25] <bomb> Chinese rope maybe
[14:54:26] <moose> But I guess the mechanism by which people do it is part of the mental illness that brings it on probably.
[14:54:32] <SKull> Diablo-D3: as someone who actually has failed a suicide attempt: it's not that easy man! ^^
[14:54:57] <bomb> reminds me of an opposition leader in Tsardom Russia, he criticized the Tsar after they failed to hang him
[14:55:01] <moose> Statistically, anyone who fails an attempt is more than 75% likely to succeed at some point in their life. It's a high figure like that.
[14:55:04] <bomb> rope was broken
[14:55:27] <SKull> yeah, i learned from it, and my backup plan now entails a sure method.
[14:55:39] <bomb> and then they hanged him again with another rope lol
[14:55:52] <SKull> not that i plan do kill myself at any time soon
[14:56:15] <moose> SKull: Just remember you can dial 143 if you ever need any assistance or feel like you need to talk to someone.
[14:56:16] <Diablo-D3> SKull: oh its really easy, tbh. spend a lifetime of eating the diet prescribed to you by the government, low in nutrition, full of plant-derived oxidized oils and other refined products, die of a heart attack in your 60s, if you dont die from that, follow a low salt diet, and that'll finish you off.

[14:57:23] <moose> Even though they had no possible way of knowing your state or anything.
[14:57:30] <Seng> tough. I mean, I'm reeeally bad at doing much, if possible I just scroll on my phone or watch youtube. I can't start to imagine how a drepression would effect me ._.

[15:04:15] <moose> But also your sodium concentrations can get out of whack quite quickly when they get high enough at all. The increase is compounding.
[15:04:36] <moose> Diablo-D3: Yes, I am aware of the modern research on this topic.
[15:04:54] <Diablo-D3> tl;dr is figure 1B and 2B.
[15:05:03] <Seng> Babbage, try with System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Unescape(outHtml);
[15:05:27] <moose> Large amounts of potassium can slow hypertensive crisis onset in people with very high serum sodium concentrations

[15:06:00] <Diablo-D3> I mean, sure, bananas are both high in carb but also low in potassium (ironically)
[15:06:02] <SKull> that is a lot of Bananas
[15:06:17] <moose> But lets assume you took a potassium supplement instead.
[15:06:20] <Diablo-D3> and yes, the banana industry has been shuffling that lie around for decades
[15:06:22] <moose> You still have the same issue.
[15:06:26] <Seng> Babbage, also please don't parse HTML with Regex, if you intented to do so. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags
[15:06:44] <bomb> parse HTML with Regex
[15:06:50] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, eating 12g/day of sodium is just as dangerous as eating 2.
[15:06:53] <Seng> bomb, it'll blow up!!
[15:07:14] <moose> Diablo-D3: That is simply not true.
[15:07:19] <Diablo-D3> the FDA currently recommends under 4g/day, or left of the bottom of that curve.
[15:07:29] <Diablo-D3> moose: take it up with the authors of that paper.
[15:07:36] <bomb> FDA can eat dirt lol
[15:07:49] <Diablo-D3> bomb: they probably do.
[15:07:52] <Babbage> hah id rather go nowhere near using regex
[15:07:52] <moose> You are wrong again, the FDA says it should be under 2.3g/day
[15:08:00] <moose> The WHO says it's supposed to be 2g and the AHA says 1.5g
[15:08:08] <Diablo-D3> moose: jesus christ, thats 350 million counts of attempted murder then.
[15:08:24] <Diablo-D3> science clearly says otherwise, and Im going to listen to the scientists on this one.
[15:08:25] <moose> You are not making any sense :/
[15:08:30] <moose> I am a scientist but ok
[15:08:34] <Diablo-D3> read. the. paper.
[15:08:55] <moose> I will indeed read it, but I don't think your comments are accurate at all.
[15:09:09] <moose> You said the FDA recommends 4g/day, which is wrong
[15:09:10] * SKull puts a fruit basket in the room, with only two bananas in it.
[15:09:17] <Diablo-D3> sure, thats wrong *now*
[15:09:21] <Diablo-D3> they updated it recently
[15:09:28] <Diablo-D3> and no, I said *under* 4g
[15:09:46] <moose> Yeah and now it's recommended under 2.3g/day
[15:09:57] <Diablo-D3> yeah, thats absurd
[15:09:57] <moose> When do you think they changed it, since you said recently'?
[15:10:05] <moose> And not really, it's still pretty high
[15:10:14] <Diablo-D3> they should be recommending between 4 and 6g/day.
[15:10:23] <moose> Why do you say that?
[15:10:42] <Diablo-D3> read. the. paper.
[15:10:56] <moose> Yes, it's unrelated to consuming sodium and the cardiovascular effects with respect to daily intake.
[15:11:02] <Seng> danish authorities recommends 5-6g but says 1.5g is enough to function.
[15:11:13] <Diablo-D3> Seng: yeah, you dont want to "just function"
[15:11:31] <moose> It's talking about sodium excretion. A person can function just fine with 750mg/day of sodium when performing moderate exercise if they are at a healthy weight.
[15:11:39] <Seng> also states that the average dane consumes 9-11g/day
[15:11:50] <Diablo-D3> Seng: yes, and that seems rather high
[15:12:07] <Diablo-D3> they'd be international outliers then
[15:12:11] <moose> Denmark is also well known for having issues with hypertension among adolescents
[15:12:22] <Diablo-D3> hmm, maybe it is true then
[15:12:24] <Diablo-D3> thats absurd
[15:12:46] <Diablo-D3> because of the trend towards low sodium in the american diet, I actually have trouble meeting the requirements.
[15:12:59] <moose> The requirement of what?
[15:13:08] <Diablo-D3> the functioning of a human body for the rest of my life.
[15:13:17] <moose> If you are eating typical american food, there's no way you are under 1g/day of sodium.
[15:13:30] <moose> And more than likely not under 2g/day.
[15:13:34] <Diablo-D3> again, at least load the paper and look at figures 1 and 2.
[15:13:40] <moose> I did.
[15:13:55] <Diablo-D3> low sodium *and* high sodium kills.
[15:13:58] <bomb> what's the source of "30-day water + electrolytes fasting" trend in the US lately?
[15:13:59] <moose> It does.
[15:14:02] <moose> I am aware.
[15:14:16] <Diablo-D3> bomb: facebook, and they're doing nothing to shut that shit down
[15:14:31] <Diablo-D3> moose: then notice the fda recommendation is in the dangerously low area on that graph.
[15:14:38] <bomb> heh
[15:14:44] <moose> That graph is about sodium excretion, not serum concentrations
[15:15:09] <Diablo-D3> yes, but you piss out all of the sodium and potassium you eat in a day
[15:15:17] <moose> That's not how it works.
[15:15:28] <Diablo-D3> its a ridiculously good way of measuring intake without having to measure intake
[15:15:45] <moose> You excrete a portion of your sodium and potassium, this is moreso with sodium than potassium, but basically the more you take in, the higher the percentage of sodium you will excrete
[15:16:19] <moose> As you take in lower amounts of sodium, you only excrete around 20% of it at the 1.5g/day intake mark.
[15:16:23] <moose> And it also depends on your serum concentration
[15:16:46] <moose> If you have high blood volume, you will excrete a lesser percentage sodium with higher intake
[15:16:49] <Seng> I think I'll go grab another cup of coffee.
[15:17:00] <Seng> If not the salt kills me, the caffeine probably will :)
[15:17:06] <moose> Caffeine is pretty safe :p
[15:17:19] <Diablo-D3> yes, people generally are aware of the sodium conserving problem of the renin–angiotensin
[15:17:36] <Diablo-D3> system
[15:17:55] <moose> No, people are not generally aware of it
[15:18:05] <Diablo-D3> let me rephrase
[15:18:06] <moose> But endocrinologists are.
[15:18:11] <Diablo-D3> people who actually *care* about this are
[15:18:21] <Diablo-D3> which is also why I find doctors' standard advise looney
[15:18:27] <Diablo-D3> the less salt you eat, *the more it holds onto*
[15:18:49] <moose> But you are assuming it's absolute.
[15:18:56] * Seng eats yet another piece of cake
[15:18:57] <moose> This is why there are specialists who study this :)
[15:19:05] <moose> Seng: You gonna share?!
[15:19:07] <Diablo-D3> high blood pressure because of sodium *increases* once you cross the threshold on that system
[15:19:15] <Diablo-D3> moose: yes, there are specialists who study it
[15:19:25] <Diablo-D3> and I think "modern medicine" should, you know, defer to the experts in the field
[15:19:45] *** Quits: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo) (Quit: Lost the game...)
[15:20:13] <Diablo-D3> we've ended up with a system that gives dangerous advice to people, and nobody is called on the carpet for it
[15:20:19] <Diablo-D3> and its been that way my entire life
[15:20:29] <moose> Dangerous advice is to tell people to eat 6g/day of sodium.
[15:20:52] <Diablo-D3> dangerous advice is to tell them to eat under 2.3
[15:20:54] <Seng> Diablo-D3, ever seen a politician lie on live tv?
[15:21:02] <Diablo-D3> Seng: dude, ever see trump talk?
[15:21:17] <moose> Diablo-D3: I don't think you understand how little your body can function on and how little it needs to be optimal.
[15:21:19] <Seng> We live in a world where there are no consequenses for giving wrong information to people.
[15:21:28] <Diablo-D3> his face says one thing, his hands and body posture say another, and then his words are something else entirely
[15:21:34] <Seng> Diablo-D3, I didn't want to make it political :b
[15:21:48] <Seng> like, concretely political *
[15:21:49] <moose> Diablo-D3: I am comfortable limiting my intake of sodium to under 1.5g/day personally and that's with actual exercise every day and consuming quite a bit of water.
[15:21:49] <Diablo-D3> the mirror neurons in my brain go NOT HUMAN, DO NOT TRUST
[15:22:04] <moose> It's difficult only because our food contains quite a lot of sodium.
[15:22:07] <Diablo-D3> moose: Im not comfortable with dangerously low levels like that.
[15:22:13] <moose> It's not dangerously low at all.
[15:23:02] <moose> I would say when you start getting as low as 500mg/day then you are pushing it as an adult male.
[15:23:13] <moose> That's a minimum I would be comfortable with, absolute minimum though.
[15:23:52] <moose> The minimum amount of sodium intake for survival is around 75mg/day
[15:24:21] <moose> Plenty of people have endured famine and survived at 75mg/day or even less. It's not fun, it would suck, there will be acute health consequences much lower than that.
[15:24:35] <moose> 500mg/day is just fine.
[15:24:35] <Diablo-D3> the point of this study is to get people to die less.
[15:24:51] <jmer> Soo how much salt is that?
[15:25:00] <Diablo-D3> for me to piss out 4g/d of sodium, I'd have to eat that much.
[15:25:02] <moose> Yes, nobody is dying with 500mg/day of sodium intake due to hyponatremia unless there is a systemic health issue going on like a dysfunction of regulatory systems.

[15:26:34] <jmer> of TUC?
[15:26:37] <moose> With respect to only sodium, assuming ideal uptake and that the labeling on those is accurate.
[15:26:37] <moose> Yep.
[15:26:50] <moose> And that's if you are not exercising heavily or excessively drinking water.
[15:26:54] <jmer> I just put salt on my food until it's tasty
[15:27:04] <jmer> I only excessively drink coffee
[15:27:06] <Diablo-D3> jmer: so about 39%.
[15:27:25] <jmer> 39% of what? food weight? - in that case, no :P
[15:27:26] <moose> jmer: 30 puts you at the recommended limits as per the American Heart Association
[15:27:35] <Diablo-D3> of the salt weight.

[15:46:20] <moose> Did they announce that they will or say it could be done?
[15:46:22] <moose> Last I heard "It could be done"
[15:46:26] <Diablo-D3> moose: oh?
[15:46:46] <bomb> moose it was the Biontech guy said it could be needed another 3-shot vax for omicron
[15:46:50] <moose> Diablo-D3: Yes, a dutch scientist isolated oxalic acid which is probably the best part about that stuff.

[15:49:03] <moose> :(
[15:49:06] <Diablo-D3> I am the dishwasher :(
[15:49:15] <Babbage> if I remember, some of the `detergents` used in e.g. bars/pubs to clean glasses are formulated in a way that actually removes glass, which can make some glasses weaker in long term (more likely to break, throw em out mr bar owner)
[15:49:20] <bomb> moose this is where he mentions the 3 dose thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPv_GxJEABE
[15:49:20] <Diablo-D3> but in the US, ever since they took the phosphate out, every dishwasher detergent went to shit
[15:49:38] <Diablo-D3> Babbage: they exist, but I dont think they're commonly used
[15:49:55] <Babbage> yup
[15:50:16] <moose> Diablo-D3: If you really have crazy needs, you can put on gloves and eye protection and use a tiny amount of lye and wait for it to cool.
[15:50:30] <moose> But I advise against it, one wrong splatter and you lose your skin/eyes
[15:50:44] <Diablo-D3> oh yeah lye is nasty
[15:52:05] <moose> So, I run a health physics business and I have to prepare a lye solution for removing contaminants that are stuck to metal
[15:52:16] <moose> The level of precaution has to be very high
[15:52:29] <Diablo-D3> yepnope, do not want
[15:53:01] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, Ive never had issues with bar keepers friend
[15:53:08] <Diablo-D3> its cheap, it works, it doesnt harm glass or metal

[19:21:57] <Diablo-D3> but then also attack microsoft for a corner case that involves team being installed, not logged in, but also set to your phone app
[19:22:02] <bomb> HN isn't a single person, though

[19:24:48] <Diablo-D3> if it involves RoR, it goes in one eyeball and out the other
[19:25:10] <bomb> nvm, I was just saying everyone was Rails fan on HN, and people using Java, C#, Python, PHP, etc. were almost bullied
[19:25:23] <Diablo-D3> when the fuck was that ever true?
[19:25:35] <Diablo-D3> I think I developed my raw unrestricted hate of ruby because of HN.
[19:26:18] <bomb> is that bingo card dude still posting?
[19:26:26] <kobo_> rails were really popular on hn before
[19:27:08] <Diablo-D3> it was popular on HN when it was popular
[19:27:18] <Diablo-D3> the window of ruby popularity is an extremely short one

[19:35:26] <Diablo-D3> why would you intentionally use null this way?
[19:35:38] <Tazy> well my library accepts null, and then defaults, but if you don't provide a value in the config scetion, you get 0 , but now since its a string, I need to parse it
[19:37:57] <Tazy> Diablo-D3, so normally one would just have "ConfigName" : "" right? but that then leads to issues when you parse
[19:38:09] <Diablo-D3> so, go through your config after parsing
[19:38:16] <Diablo-D3> and then set "" to null

[19:55:26] <_Shurik_> Don't have that one
[19:55:49] <bomb> then buy one. problem solved, next!
[19:55:50] <_Shurik_> it's between Las Paul and Ibanez Steve Vai signature at this point
[19:56:35] <bomb> I love hollowbody guitars
[19:56:53] <Diablo-D3> bomb: I do not play guitar
[19:56:54] <_Shurik_> for accoustics sure
[19:57:04] <xb0o2> I don't like playing Les Pauls
[19:57:04] <_Shurik_> not for solo gutars, jeez
[19:57:21] <bomb> it's fine for solo, depending on your genre
[19:57:23] <_Shurik_> xb0o2: why?
[19:57:24] <xb0o2> But that Ibanez also looks gaudy as hell
[19:57:26] <bomb> you don't do no jazz, I'm guessing
[19:57:57] <_Shurik_> Les Paul's tone is legendary
[19:58:27] <_Shurik_> And Ibanez SV is for pure shredding.  Low action, locked tuners and a whammy bar
[19:58:28] <bomb> it's too meowy for hard rock
[19:59:19] <_Shurik_> also you can fight off pretty much anyone with Las Paul.  Thing is heavy AF
[19:59:52] <bomb> important factor
[20:00:04] <_Shurik_> I don't have Gibson though, but Epiphone that I have is really good.  I don't even see a reason to go with Gibson
[20:00:21] <bomb> SG is awesome
[20:00:34] <bomb> but a little redundant after your LP
[20:00:47] <_Shurik_> right
[20:01:07] <_Shurik_> I think the only other electric guitar I'd get is Fender SRV signature
[20:01:12] <_Shurik_> I really liked that one
[20:01:28] <_Shurik_> very well balanced
[20:02:10] <bomb> nice jbass sunburnt colors
[20:02:35] <bomb> what kind of music you play?
[20:03:29] <_Shurik_> I actually primarily play bass
[20:03:47] <_Shurik_> solo guitar is just something I want to advance on.  I'm a pretty good bass player as is
[20:04:23] <_Shurik_> I play mixture of stuff. But rock-ish mostly
[20:04:32] <_Shurik_> no jazz... it hurts my brain

[20:05:57] <_Shurik_> of course
[20:06:19] <_Shurik_>  My go-to bass is G&L 5 string.  I fucking love that thing
[20:06:45] <bomb> find Undurskin on Youtube/Spotify. they're one bass one drum band
[20:06:46] <_Shurik_> And thinking about buying Bongo 6 string
[20:07:23] <bomb> can't dare to try 5 string yet lol. I can even do with one string most of the time
[20:07:41] <_Shurik_> oh I absolutely have to have 5 strings
[20:07:49] <bomb> my 'style'  ->  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aoH-1ZfqZ0
[20:07:50] <_Shurik_> 6 - is really just for the looks as I don't play bass solos
[20:07:55] <bomb> so you solo a lot?
[20:07:56] <_Shurik_> but gotta have me my low B
[20:07:59] <_Shurik_> no
[20:08:03] <bomb> why 5 string then
[20:09:20] <_Shurik_> Low B because
[20:09:38] <Diablo-D3> but why not 8
[20:09:48] <_Shurik_> Diablo-D3: cause no need
[20:10:06] <Diablo-D3> but how else will you make argent metal?
[20:10:08] <_Shurik_> 4 is fine too, but with 5 you get a hidden weapon

[20:50:33] <_Shurik_> this is what I'm planning to jam to today with my solo teacher to show my current skill:

[21:01:11] <ern> Only. Base.
[21:04:47] <bomb> holy shit man
[21:05:02] <bomb> GTA Vice City was set in 80s, right? 1986 precisely
[21:05:20] <bomb> and the game was released in 2002. 16 years difference
[21:05:31] <bomb> but Vice City itself is 20  years old now lol

[21:13:58] <Diablo-D3> so I think I may have fixed my wsl2 issues
[21:14:50] <bomb> removed it completely?
[21:15:05] <Diablo-D3> no
[21:15:12] <Diablo-D3> the issue isnt wsl2 itself, that works surprisingly well

[21:15:18] <Diablo-D3> like, really well, its absurd
[21:15:38] <Diablo-D3> I remember when anything in hyper-v was god awful
[21:16:03] <Diablo-D3> the issue is portproxy
[21:16:30] <Diablo-D3> its a very ancient piece of code that was just jammed in badly and never really fixed
[21:16:37] <Diablo-D3> all it does is allow NATs
[21:16:53] <Diablo-D3> it comes from the vista era, and wasnt written by what you'd consider the "core networking team"
[21:17:03] <bomb> do you pronounce it like "W, S, L, two", or just "weasel" like I do?
[21:17:09] <_Shurik_> bomb: well I know all of that
[21:17:17] <Diablo-D3> it was written by the "get ipv6 to work no matter what, because we need features to sell team"
[21:17:40] <Diablo-D3> guess what handles portproxy, even though its not an ipv6 feature per se
[21:18:05] <Diablo-D3> ipv6 support does. on pre-8? machines, you cant even have portproxy running on that network adapter unless it has ipv6 enabled
[21:18:06] <bomb> dreamrock sucks balls btw
[21:18:12] <bomb> gen z is dumb
[21:19:12] <Diablo-D3> so, where portproxy's service, iphlpsrv or whatever its called, starts up at a bad time
[21:19:27] <Diablo-D3> it starts up when networking does, yet networking is eclipsed inside of fast startup.
[21:19:49] <Diablo-D3> yet, as far as I can fucking tell, this issue *isnt* fast startup related, as in, turning it off doesn't fix this
[21:20:06] <Diablo-D3> yet every fucking thing Ive read online indicates it is
[21:20:22] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, I have a script that runs on user login that does all the shit
[21:20:44] <Diablo-D3> removes firewall rule, makes firewall rule, resets portproxy, reconfigs portproxy
[21:20:51] <Diablo-D3> and sometimes it'd just not fucking work
[21:21:40] <Diablo-D3> or it stops working after a few days
[21:23:23] <Diablo-D3> so my script now does exactly one more thing
[21:23:30] <Diablo-D3> restarts the iphlpsrv

[21:49:07] <bomb> alright. it's cute :)
[21:49:17] <DevJohnC> I used to use more typical hair dye products but they striped out of my hair very quickly and the constant application is very damaging to hair
