[01:59:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Abbreviate, perhaps? `rl/meta-learning`?
[01:59:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> The problem with your suggestion is just that nobody will get it unless they look real close
[01:59:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> People aren't used to distributing like that
[01:59:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> They read such things as individual units
[02:01:47] <gwern> even if I decide to rename 87 files to rl/, that doesn't help other cases. in genetics/, for example, something could easily be tagged under genetics/heritable, genetics/correlation, genetics/selection/dysgenics, and more besides which don't happen to exist yet
[02:02:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> no no
[02:02:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't rename anything
[02:02:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just have the *link text* be rl/
[02:02:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> The actual path can still be reinforcement-learning
[02:02:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I take your point about genetics/ and so on...
[02:02:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Perhaps the real solution is collapsing the tag list when it gets long
[02:03:32] <gwern> (that might be necessary in popups but is against the spirit of tag-directory's indices)
[02:03:52] <gwern> also, we don't have any CSS set up for inline collapsing
[02:04:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Correct, it'd have to be de novo
[02:04:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> As for directory indices, well, leave it full there
[02:04:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's no space constraints there!
[02:05:46] <gwern> probably be good to collapse in popups regardless. even with +compression, they'll still get uncomfortably long
[02:06:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> + compression is no good

[02:06:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> For the reason I said

[11:10:27] <Obormot\Gaia> Let me elaborate
[11:10:50] <Obormot\Gaia> On a different machine, `ssh -V` tells me `OpenSSH_6.9p1, LibreSSL 2.1.8`
[11:10:58] <feep[work]> mine is OpenSSH_8.4p1 Ubuntu-5ubuntu1.2, OpenSSL 1.1.1j  16 Feb 2021
[11:10:59] <Obormot\Gaia> Do you see how it's not clear which of these is newer
[11:11:04] <Obormot\Gaia> Or what these version numbers even mean
[11:11:10] <feep[work]> no? the second one is newer
[11:11:12] <feep[work]> 9 > 2.
[11:11:21] <Obormot\Gaia> Ok I guess?
[11:11:52] <feep[work]> I assume the second half is because ssh doesn't actually do all the really important crypto things
[11:12:00] <feep[work]> so you want that broken out in a separate version
[11:12:05] <feep[work]> well, *you* presumably don't

[12:54:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: How does this 80k hours essay account for the fact that the EA movement has suffered from severe entryism, toxic behaviors and environments, and miscellaneous other afflictions?
[12:56:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just reading this "The bottom line" section... it seems as if the author of this piece is taking an *extreme* "mistake theoretic" approach, where everyone he is speaking to has only the noblest intentions, but sometimes, due to human frailty and imperfection, fails to achieve their intended results
[12:56:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are no malefactors, bad actors, freeloaders, or enemies
[12:57:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Through trade, coordination, and economies of scale, individuals can achieve greater impact by working within a community than they could working individually.
[12:57:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> These opportunities are often overlooked when people make a ‚Äúsingle-player‚Äù analysis of impact, in which the actions of others are held fixed. This can lead to inaccurate estimates of impact, missed opportunities for trade, and leave people open to coordination failures such as the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma.
[12:57:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Coordinating well requires having good mechanisms, such as markets (e.g. certificates of impact), norms that support coordination, common knowledge, and other structures."
[12:57:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Communities of entirely self-interested people can still cooperate to a large degree, but ‚Äúshared aims‚Äù communities can likely cooperate even more.
[12:57:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> For the effective altruism community to coordinate better we should:
[12:57:20] <Obormot\Arcturus>     Aim to uphold ‚Äúnice norms,‚Äù such as helpfulness, honesty, compromise, and friendliness to an exceptional degree, but also be willing to withhold aid from people who break these norms.
[12:57:20] <Obormot\Arcturus>     Consider the impact of our actions on ‚Äúcommunity capital‚Äù ‚Äî the potential of the community to have an impact in the future. We might prioritise actions that grow the influence of the community, improve the community‚Äôs reputation, set an example by upholding norms, or set up community infrastructure to spread information and enable trades."
[12:57:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> etc., etc.
[12:58:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> The table of contents does not seem to indicate any part of this essay that deals with any seriously conflicting goals, any "community members" who don't hold the shared goals, etc.
[12:59:00] <PapuaHardyNet> entryism: I agree. toxic behaviors and environments: I haven't heard about this yet. however, I entirely agree with you that this entire article advocates a very mistake theoretic approach.
[12:59:17] <feep[work]> <Obormot\Arcturus> I think that's a mistake.
[12:59:24] * feep[work] flees
[12:59:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't actually know if it is
[12:59:59] <PapuaHardyNet> the essay does deal with conflicts actually. First off, it talks about co-ordination failures, and then with every prescription of how to act, it also describes why it is rational for someone to act that way
[13:00:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> It might be deliberate - enemy action, a false flag
[13:00:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> But my purpose here is not to argue with the essay's author, who isn't here, but to make these points to e.g. PapuaHardyNet, who is here
[13:00:35] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, the essay doesn't deal with subterfuge, and where it does, it recommends caution, and an exponential backoff approahc to forgiveness
[13:00:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: That's not "conflicts"
[13:01:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also let me just say as a sort of side note
[13:01:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is kind of hilarious to read, in these sorts of analyses, parts like this
[13:01:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> "One way to avoid a prisoner‚Äôs dilemma is to give power to another entity that enforces coordination. For instance, if each prisoner is a member of the mafia, then they know that if they defect they‚Äôll be killed. This means that each prisoner will be better off by staying quiet (regardless of what the other says), and this lets them achieve the optimal joint outcome. Joining the mafia changed the incentive structure,
[13:01:15] <Obormot\Arcturus>  allowing a better result.
[13:01:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> We do this in society with governments and regulation. Governments can (in theory) mandate that everyone take the actions that will lead to the optimal outcome, then punish those who defect.
[13:01:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Governments can also enforce contracts, which provide another route to avoiding coordination failures. Instead of the mafia boss who will kill prisoners who defect, each prisoner could enter into a contract saying they will pay a penalty if they defect."
[13:02:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Using the mafia as an example of successfully solving coordination problems and thereby enabling cooperation and the creation of value! The "optimal joint outcome"!
[13:02:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Quite common, of course
[13:02:18] <feep[work]> doesn't it?
[13:02:19] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. I'd like to point out one thing: I grew up in a very conflict-theoretic environment. this stuff is especially helpful for me because I want to maximize my value to communities like ours, and to people like us.
[13:02:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> But pretty much no one who writes like this seems to stop and say
[13:02:40] <nshepperd2> well is suppose it is common for people in prison
[13:03:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> "first of all, the mafia kills people, extorts more people, and otherwise destroys value, and generally speaking they are the enemy of decent people"
[13:03:28] <nshepperd2> the true answer to the prisoner's dilemma: actually who cares, these people are probably in prison for a good reason, screw 'em
[13:03:30] <feep[work]> I think there's a difference between saying the mafia is evil and saying the mafia is ineffective.
[13:03:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> "second of all, historically, mafias were and are the source of a constant stream of violence and mayhem"
[13:03:54] <PapuaHardyNet> isn't that obvious though? the goal is to show a solution to a co-ordination failure, and use that to our own (positive) ends
[13:03:59] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: so were states.
[13:04:27] <feep[work]> hell, countries. governments in general.
[13:05:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Uh-huh, and tell me, during which historical period would you prefer to live in a region of the U.S. where the Mafia had a strong presence compared to one where it did not?
[13:05:17] <nshepperd2> yes, 'governments are just good mafias' is the standard response to that
[13:05:21] <feep[work]> objection: nobody is saying the mafia is better than the us government
[13:05:31] <feep[work]> objection 2: I just explicitly said there's a difference between good and effective
[13:05:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then what's the point of the "tu quoque"?
[13:05:52] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: if we're looking at technical effectiveness, moral alignment is secondary
[13:06:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course it's not secondary
[13:06:32] <PapuaHardyNet> okay okay hold on
[13:06:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whole point is effectiveness *at achieving desirable ends*

[13:06:55] <PapuaHardyNet> having someone in power is literally a solution to preventing co-ordination failures
[13:06:58] <nshepperd2> to begin with the prisoner's dilemma is about two convicted felons conspiring to get one over on the government
[13:07:01] <feep[work]> hang on, but the mafia isn't trying to prevent violence
[13:07:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> They are! They do!
[13:07:17] <feep[work]> it is trying to create value, for the leadership, and I assume it's good at that or nobody would do that
[13:07:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> No!
[13:07:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> All of what you're saying is wrong
[13:07:34] <feep[work]> kay
[13:07:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Literally all of it
[13:07:39] <kuudes> they prevent intercriminal violence
[13:08:45] <nshepperd2> in the example, the mafia involved does result in a better outcome, for the criminals in question
[13:08:57] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: okay, afaics you have two points: 1. the violence is inherent in the system and 2. the system doesn't even work for its perpetuators?
[13:09:07] <nshepperd2> who get to leave prison sooner and go and stab someone new or w/e
[13:09:30] <nshepperd2> obviously this is a worse outcome for everyone else
[13:11:07] *** Joins: o (~niko@libera/staff/niko)
[13:12:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: I have two points: 1. The *supposed* example of successfully solving a coordination problem seems to be associated with massive negative externalities *and* simultaneously also massive *intended* zero (or even negative) sum consequences, why is this? is it a coincidence or is it a fundamental feature of this class of "solutions"? have we checked? 2. The alleged solution isn't actually even a very good solution, and
[13:12:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>  historically seems to often fail, why is this? is it a coincidence or etc. (ditto as above)
[13:12:36] <feep[work]> does it seem to often fail?
[13:12:41] <feep[work]> I'm not sure it actually does
[13:12:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> It does, yes
[13:13:05] <feep[work]> I mean, like, germany has gone through four states in maybe living memory
[13:13:22] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't get it. When the state has a monopoly on violence, there's no issue, but when the mafia enforces a monopoly on violence, now this co-ordination solution is bad?
[13:13:25] <feep[work]> like, I'm not actually sure if the average mafia has a shorter or longer lifetime
[13:13:49] <nshepperd2> the answer to point 1 is conflict theory
[13:14:07] <feep[work]> "evil people who can coordinate can evil better" nobody questioned this
[13:14:08] <nshepperd2> the mafia is evil, not good, so of course it has negative externalities
[13:14:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Where are you getting the idea that there's such a thing as "the mafia" that has ever successfully enforced a monopoly on violence (without actually in fact being the state)?
[13:15:14] <PapuaHardyNet> in the example given, two criminals have equal amounts of violence they can unleash on each other. However, by threatening murder for betrayal, the mafia enforces such a significant power by coercing the other members to agree to the rules
[13:15:22] <PapuaHardyNet> that this counts as a monopoly on violence
[13:15:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Yes, indeed, but the question is whether the mafia's evilness is orthogonal to solving coordination problems by killing people who defect, or whether there might perhaps be some correlation or maybe even a causal relationship somehow
[13:15:40] <nshepperd2> oh well
[13:15:55] <nshepperd2> killing people for defecting is falling out of fashion in democratic governments

[13:16:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[13:16:28] <PapuaHardyNet> you know what, I think we are getting really off-base here. what better alternative do you propose for ensuring a better outcome for the two criminals? what better co-ordination solution do you have in mind? I'm curious

[14:10:11] <Gurkenglas> Catalonia wants to be independent because it's net negative on tax flow, what's Spain's claim against? That Catalonia would have chosen to commit to remain from what it expected a long time ago?
[14:12:13] <PlanckWalk> Hmm.  I'm now wondering whether my region is net negative on tax flow.
[14:12:21] <PlanckWalk> And by my region I mean my 1000m^2
[14:12:32] <PapuaHardyNet> you own a lot of land, I see
[14:13:14] <PlanckWalk> I do receive benefits of many government expenditures.  I'm just not sure *how much* benefit.
[14:13:28] <PlanckWalk> In a quantifiable $ sense.
[14:13:55] <PapuaHardyNet> how much is your land worth? I hesitate to even estimate, 1km^2 is huge
[14:14:08] <Gurkenglas> 1000m^2 is not 1km^2
[14:14:21] <PapuaHardyNet> what
[14:14:29] <Gurkenglas> (1000m)^2 is not 1000(m^2)
[14:14:33] <feep[work]> 1km^2=1000000m^2
[14:14:39] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, oh yeah
[14:15:06] <PapuaHardyNet> that's not a lot then, 1000m^2 is basically a normal house size
[14:15:11] <Gurkenglas> oh man that would have been a neat wrong belief to have in you as a dm as i wreck the magic system
[14:15:26] <PlanckWalk> Though not far from where I am, 1 km^2 is not much :)
[14:15:45] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd love to play dnd with you as the dm. the amount of insanity that would occur would be very entertaining

[14:19:14] <Gurkenglas> i'd be open to running the following ~freestyle game: everyone writes a character description in prose. magic/scifi/whatever. I read the character descriptions and in my head scale the power levels to be matched. When you do something i decide how likely it is it'd work. we see what happens. can you find some players?
[14:19:18] <PlanckWalk> Plus a few much larger properties
[14:19:19] <dutchie> i guess you are also going to be different if you are comparing area of the footprint to actual usable area in the house
[14:19:32] <dutchie> because to a first approximation a two-storey house has double the usable area
[14:20:15] <Gurkenglas> If there were agreement on whose territorial claims are currently legitimate, we could set up a market for those claims. I wonder whether, given that there's disagreement on whose claims are legitimate, we could set up the market to keep track of the disagreement, such that it decreases over time...
[14:22:00] <PapuaHardyNet> that's more of a moderated group roleplaying game - while we can find people willing to do that in the roleplaying communities, I'm a bit hesitant that they are people we should do a game with.

[14:22:49] <Gurkenglas> The only context was my last line on Catalonia.
[14:23:51] <Gurkenglas> yes i dared bring up a random topic while you were talking about VR catboys. if someone wants to have me derail their conversations less say so.
[14:24:21] <PlanckWalk> Catboys, Catalonia, obvious connection.  Seems legit.
[14:25:22] <feep[work]> catalonia, dogtogetheria
[14:26:10] <Gurkenglas> it's not a good sign for my pattern recognition's calibration that it keeps being this impressed with nominative determinism
[14:27:03] <Gurkenglas> I'm curious about Catalonia specifically because it seems to be a clear-cut case of what you'd think independence is always about when the cows are spherical.
[14:27:33] <PlanckWalk> I know approximately nothing about Catalonia
[14:27:36] <feep[work]> tfw the cows are spherical
[14:28:13] <Gurkenglas> Then we can work in the abstract! What legitimate argument could your ruler make against you separating just because your tax flow is negative?
[14:28:39] <feep[work]> "we'll arrest you"
[14:28:48] <Gurkenglas> i said legitimate
[14:28:56] <feep[work]> monopoly on force!
[14:29:06] <Gurkenglas> assuming the consequent
[14:29:18] <feep[work]> observing the actual :P
[14:29:41] <Gurkenglas> suppose we hadn't observed that.
[14:29:52] <feep[work]> then we'd be in a state of nature and there'd be no ruler
[14:30:24] <PlanckWalk> "You're using a terrible metric and separating will make everyone worse off"
[14:30:34] <feep[work]> the point is of course that legitimacy is totally undefined and subjective.
[14:31:56] <Gurkenglas> PlanckWalk, that's something! So the vassal thinks that the ruler comes out ahead a lot and the vassal behind, and the ruler says that the ruler comes out ahead a lot and the vassal barely ahead.
[14:32:52] <PlanckWalk> Eh, I guess that's one subcase sure
[14:33:42] <Gurkenglas> PlanckWalk, is the more general case that everyone agrees that the vassal comes out behind, but the ruler says that the correct utility function to have is to take the average of everyone's?
[14:34:27] <PlanckWalk> No, that's a different subcase
[14:34:30] <Gurkenglas> (worded that poorly in the sense that it's obviously not "more general" than the previous)
[14:34:52] <Gurkenglas> PlanckWalk, like, what do you mean by "everyone worse off"? Pareto? Average?
[14:34:55] <PlanckWalk> The more general case is just "vassal thinks they currently come out behind" (compared with being a separate state) and the rules disagrees.
[14:35:03] <PlanckWalk> ruler*
[14:35:33] <Gurkenglas> What's the difference between that and my first subcase?
[14:35:50] <PlanckWalk> You added more restrictive quantifiers.
[14:38:12] <Gurkenglas> Accepted. So the cure is... make an agreement that in the future, when the situation is more clear, Catalonia will be compensated if it turns out it would have been better off leaving?
[14:38:17] <PlanckWalk> By "everyone" I wasn't referring to any specific metric.  There are certainly individuals who will come out ahead (according to their own utilities), so if we're drillign down to the level of individuals such a statement wouldn't be applicable.
[14:39:07] <Gurkenglas> so instead say "You're using a terrible metric and separating will make you worse off", right?
[14:39:16] <saturn2> "if you leave our mutual defense arrangement, you've given up your right not to be attacked by us, so we'll attack you" what part is illegitimate?
[14:39:37] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, the duress
[14:39:38] <PlanckWalk> Gurkenglas: Ehh, not what I intended but it works too.
[14:40:10] <PlanckWalk> I did intend "both the vassal's new state and the rest of the original state will both be worse off"
[14:40:14] <saturn2> ok so you're an anarchist
[14:40:50] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, i'd like to know whether I should support Catalonian independence.
[14:41:08] <saturn2> no
[14:41:08] <PlanckWalk> Now whether this is *true* or not will depend uponthe situation.
[14:41:19] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, why not?
[14:41:50] <PlanckWalk> Even "true" isn't really the right word.
[14:42:24] <saturn2> you should support the abolition of all governments, therefore you shouldn't support the formation of a new government in catalonia or anywhere else
[14:42:26] <PlanckWalk> As for cure, I have no idea.
[14:42:56] <PlanckWalk> I don't think the proposed one woudl be a cure, though.  Way too many bad incentives.
[14:43:33] <PlanckWalk> Especially since they're all surrounding a historical counterfactual
[14:43:48] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, that proof is by contradiction, i'd like a constructive one.
[14:43:57] <PlanckWalk> Those don't tend to get any more clear over time
[14:45:37] <saturn2> or i suppose you could support recursive independence movements until each government only covers one person
[14:45:53] <ivan> can someone explain the joke in the topic for me, is it like a corruption of human memory
[14:46:16] <PlanckWalk> I shoudl let you know that my rebellious personality aspect wants to declare independence from the rest of me.
[14:46:17] <nshepperd> i too would like to be in a state of no duress without requiring military defence
[14:46:37] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, i agree that if everyone with negative tax flow separates soon you have no tax flow. Why have tax flow?
[14:46:45] <nshepperd> perhaps i could move to Solaria
[14:47:29] <PlanckWalk> I'll join you there!  Err, hmm...
[14:47:55] <PlanckWalk> I'll wish you well and go somewhere very similar!
[14:47:59] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd, i can imagine a military defense setup without tax flow.
[14:48:01] <nshepperd> lol
[14:48:22] <nshepperd> can you imagine a square triangle
[14:48:30] <Gurkenglas> yeah
[14:48:37] <nshepperd> impressive
[14:49:21] <Gurkenglas> via a trick. put 3 corners on north pole, 2 on the equator, connect them via the surface of the earth, 3 right angles :P
[14:49:29] <Gurkenglas> *1 of 3
[14:51:21] <PlanckWalk> Well, equilateral right-angled triangle.  I guess that's square-like
[14:51:50] <nshepperd> squarish, if you squint while high on acid
[14:52:55] <PlanckWalk> I was trying to think of some abstract figure that might have four equal sides separated by right angles.  Three right angles, so that it's a triangle.
[14:53:49] <PlanckWalk> But couldn't come up with anything.
[14:54:58] <PlanckWalk> (In some suitably horrible abstract space, of course)
[14:56:14] <Gurkenglas> Four sides separated by three angles? How many angles does each side separate?
[14:56:16] <PlanckWalk> I do like the right angled hexagons in hyperbolic space.
[14:56:33] <PlanckWalk> Gurkenglas: Two!
[14:56:54] <Gurkenglas> uh, i mean a. how many angles does each side have and b. how many sides does each angle have
[14:57:01] <Gurkenglas> two is @b presumable
[14:57:05] <Gurkenglas> *presumably
[14:57:06] <PlanckWalk> That was rather the problem :)
[14:57:30] <PlanckWalk> I was trying to think up some weird space where that could be resolved.
[14:58:56] <PlanckWalk> At any rate, you'd definitely need to find some very noncentral examples of both "square" and "triangle".
[14:59:54] <Gurkenglas> suppose there is a "relation" list of pairs (side, angle), where there are 4 sides and 3 angles. if every angle is related to 2 sides then the sides can't all be related to the same number of angles.
[15:00:02] <PlanckWalk> An octahedron can be viewed as a 3D generalization of both squares and triangles.
[15:00:40] <Gurkenglas> if every side is to be related to the same number of angles and every angle to the same number of sides (and you can't have duplicate pairs) then every side is related to every angle.
[15:01:57] <PlanckWalk> Yes.
[15:02:08] <Gurkenglas> so every "side" has three spots at which an angle can be attached. a tetrahedron has four sides and three (three-dimensional) angles :)
[15:02:30] <Gurkenglas> warp space a little and those angles can be right.
[15:02:59] <Gurkenglas> wait, no. 4 angles. dang.
[15:03:31] <Gurkenglas> i assumed it must be 3 angles but missed that every side is unrelated to one angle.

[15:17:31] <Gurkenglas> sew three strips of cloth into a stack at the two ends. one can continously transform 1->2->3->1 in 3D space, holding the ends constant, such that the resulting 3D shape doesn't intersect itself.
[15:18:20] <Gurkenglas> this shape has 2 corners, 3 curved edges, and 3 sides.
[15:20:11] <Gurkenglas> analogously: sew four triangles into a stack at the three corners. continuously transform 1->2->3->4->1 through 4D space, holding the edges constant. 3 corners, 3 edges, 4 sides, 4 "3D-surfaces".

[15:22:16] <Gurkenglas> aaaaanyway. therefore we're allowed to suppose unlikely hypotheticals. what legitimate arguments are there for vassaldom?
[15:22:57] <Gurkenglas> Planck's argument is that the vassal might be mistaken about wanting to leave.
[15:24:07] <Gurkenglas> The argument I can think of is that regions might *expect* to benefit from relinquishing their right to leave even if they later don't.
[15:29:38] <Gurkenglas> <PlanckWalk> I shoudl let you know that my rebellious personality aspect wants to declare independence from the rest of me. <- Consider satisfying it in some way not destructive to your other plans!
