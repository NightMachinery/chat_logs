[12:28:07] <GuiToris> what would you use there?

[20:49:03] <no_gravity> Good evening!
[20:49:36] <paul424> MetaNova, context is in Polish "akcje " == actions means share bonds
[20:49:59] <paul424> so some people say "actions on the stock market " ... is that correct ? 
[20:50:07] <no_gravity> Does this sound right? "Click on an engine or type the first letter of its name to search"
[20:50:36] <bin> paul424: i do not understand what it is that you're asking.
[20:50:52] <bin> are you asking if buying bond shares is considered acting on the market?
[20:50:54] <bin> if so, yes.
[20:51:00] <paul424> haaaaaaaaaaahahhh
[20:51:07] <paul424> no.
[20:51:12] <paul424> the word "action"
[20:51:23] <paul424> does it mean the same AS "bond share"
[20:52:15] <bin> no
