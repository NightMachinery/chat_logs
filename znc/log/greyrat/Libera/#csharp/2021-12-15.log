[01:14:49] <entropygain> first thing i think is that it is just not reaching the end of configureservices
[01:15:25] <Arokh> entropygain it does. I can reach it with debugging.
[01:16:23] <entropygain> the second thing that comes to mind then is some small mistake you'd have to just get another pair of eyes on it
[01:17:23] <biberu> Arokh: break and check what is being waited on?
[01:21:19] <Arokh> biberu I did step through but the last thing it reaches is https://gist.github.com/DvdKhl/6aa7adeb89b8b09e7d20baa9e683a3ba line 3. After that anon method and doing another debug step it hangs.
[01:21:35] <biberu> Arokh: are you using vs?
[01:21:51] <Arokh> Yes VS2022
[01:22:45] <biberu> check if debug > windows > threads or parallel stacks give you any insight
[01:25:47] <Nasp> What secret stuff do you have in your startup?=
[01:25:53] <Nasp> you wouldn't be chance have hardcoded credentials?
[01:26:20] <Nasp> So with debugging it does hit it?
[01:29:35] <Arokh> Nasp, just pasting the startup isn't really helpful since the registering happens in other files but here you go: https://gist.github.com/DvdKhl/4b9d26eba4a88c7db71f2cc6ec1d2f05
[01:30:58] <Arokh> biberu sadly nothing that really helps https://imgur.com/a/DANwbPG
[01:31:06] <entropygain> it's just odd because even if there was some orphaned task i wouldn't expect that to hold up the configure method
[01:31:11] <entropygain> something would have to be awaiting on it

[01:34:57] <biberu> Arokh: is it stuck i receiving deltas?
[01:36:13] <Arokh> That is at least what I see after starting the project waiting for a bit and then hit pause. So I guess yes.
[01:36:36] <biberu> never tried, but appears that there's logging you can enable for that step, i guess it's this: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/v6.0.101/src/BuiltInTools/DotNetDeltaApplier/StartupHook.cs
[01:37:02] <biberu> note LogDeltaClientMessages
[01:38:23] <Arokh> let me check
[01:40:13] <biberu> looks like it might be supposed to stay in that loop, but the log should show if it's going at least
[01:41:56] <Lukky> In your opinion, are JetBrains products worth their price? A guy I work with is trying to sell me into getting their all-in-one package

[12:51:21] <MatthiasVance> But mostly VPNs are to get to the machine, but the machine can communicate with the world freely
[12:51:34] <Tobbi_> Ah, I see...
[12:51:39] <MatthiasVance> So it could connect to whatever system you use to push updates
[12:51:55] <Tobbi_> *maybe*
[12:52:52] <Tobbi_> Actually...
[12:53:03] <Tobbi_> The customer's machine would have to do something as well, no?
[12:53:10] <MatthiasVance> What do you mean?
[12:53:18] <MatthiasVance> You need to install an agent there yes
[12:53:22] <Tobbi_> right...
[12:53:31] <MatthiasVance> An "auto updater" as it were
[12:53:36] <Tobbi_> Yeah, I get it...
[12:53:49] <Tobbi_> Sounds interesting...
[12:54:04] <MatthiasVance> I know, just reiterated it with a different term because customers might not like "installing an agent" but they are fine "installing an updater" :D
[12:54:09] <Tobbi_> :D
[12:54:17] <Tobbi_> You're right.

[12:54:58] <jmer> MatthiasVance: why? xD
[12:55:14] <MatthiasVance> jmer: That is fine for single-client software I think, but not when you're deploying things to multiple customers if you know what I mean
[12:55:19] <MatthiasVance> Difference from pulling vs pushing
[12:55:30] <jmer> I am not following the entire chat, I am in a meeting xD

[12:56:15] <MatthiasVance> I guess the difference I wanted to mention is that with a real auto-updater you might not have vision over what customer has installed what version
[12:56:23] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: haha, yes!
[12:57:38] <Tobbi_> MatthiasVance: Once, a couple years back I was in an IRL meeting with a customer... I installed an AutoIT application to handle Microsoft Word macro errors that pop up. And the coworker I don't get along with mentioned something along those lines to make me seem bad in front of the customer...
[12:57:50] <Tobbi_> he expected this to cause a problem.
[12:57:59] <Tobbi_> And them to not want arbitrary software on their system.
[12:58:22] <Tobbi_> But after I explained to them what it did, they were fine with it.
[12:58:26] <Tobbi_> So at least that's that...
[13:00:19] <Tobbi_> Still an asshole move.
[13:00:34] <Tobbi_> I could've passed the ball back to him since he's the one responsible for Excel macros.

[13:01:47] <Tobbi_> They are indeed.
[13:01:56] <Tobbi_> We're working on replacing them with EPPlus.

[19:07:00] *** Quits: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[19:07:05] <Nasp> yes preferable a db context per operation
[19:10:53] <Flonk> jonp, it says "stored per thread" so I guess it's not as simple as setting a `initialCapacity` in the constructor or whatever
[19:11:05] <jonp> yup
[19:11:16] <Flonk> It also looks like the array doubles in size when it fills up so that' like 10 reallocations until we get into the 100k's of elements
[19:11:23] <Nasp> Ohh that how it does it
[19:11:31] <Flonk> Whatever, it's probably not worth thinking about :p
[19:11:51] <jonp> Flonk: and part of the point there is that you have concurrent consumers and creators
[19:12:01] <jonp> so why would the bag reach 100k elements?  what are the consumers *doing*?
[19:13:54] <Flonk> I guess so, that probably doesn't happen often. In my case I use Parallel.For to deserialize a bunch of data into a ConcurrentBag but I need all of it done before I can continue processing.
[19:14:20] <Jck_true> So I have using System.Threading; and NO reference to System.Windows.Forms But I'm getting a warning "'Timer' is an ambiguous reference between 'System.Windows.Forms.Timer' and 'System.Threading.Timer'"
[19:16:22] <jonp> Jck_true: add: using Timer = Whichever.Namespace.You.Want.Timer;
[19:16:50] <Jck_true> But... Where is System.Windows.Forms comming from?
[19:17:12] <MaNa2k> jonp, what is that? are we getting concurrency control in blob storage queue?
[19:17:21] <jonp> Jck_true: you have a `using System.Windows.Forms` from somewhereâ€¦
[19:17:30] <jonp> MaNa2k: ?
[19:17:39] <MaNa2k> jonp, forget it
[19:17:55] <MaNa2k> was thinking about duplicate control like service bus queue has it
[19:17:55] <Jck_true> So anywhere in the namespace... I don't reallly get it
[19:18:17] <canton7> Jck_true, what .NET version are you using?
[19:18:27] <Jck_true> .NET6 in VS2022
[19:18:38] <jonp> you might have an "implicit using"?
[19:18:48] <canton7> Jck_true, that introduced "Global Usings" -- It might be that winforms projects automatically include some System.Windows.Forms namespaces now
[19:18:54] <Jck_true> Ahhh
[19:19:11] <Nasp> Can't wait to get implicit usings
[19:19:22] <Nasp> Will be nice to get rid of all those standard imports
[19:19:22] <Jck_true> What a weird design choice
[19:19:51] <canton7> Set <ImplicitUsings>disable</ImplicitUsings> in a <PropertyGroup> in your csproj to disable it
[19:21:35] <canton7> Yeah, that's a level of magic I just don't get along with

[19:42:12] <shadowchaser> is hangfire good library for retries?
[19:42:41] <MatthiasVance> I'm busy, please try again later.
[19:42:51] <MatthiasVance> shadowchaser: ERROR. ERROR.
[19:43:04] <MatthiasVance> shadowchaser: What kind of retries? :)
[19:43:34] <shadowchaser> MatthiasVance :) requests to rest api
[19:43:40] <edcba> well
[19:43:44] <MatthiasVance> shadowchaser: In that case I'd look at Polly
[19:44:02] <Nasp> Depends on what kinf of retry
[19:44:08] <Nasp> But can't you leverage a bus
[19:44:14] <Nasp> Also have a max retry policy please
[19:44:27] <edcba> yeah it depends on whether you really want to pass that call or not :)
[19:44:33] <shadowchaser> MatthiasVance cheers, however hangfire is used in code i've inherited, so question is rather should it be on my to replace list or can stay?
[19:44:41] <Inge> MatthiasVance: ClosedXML is small and easy to use and has no dependencies on office dll's and stuff...
[19:45:01] <MatthiasVance> Inge: Shiver when a library would actually require office to talk to XML files :D
[19:45:15] <MatthiasVance> shadowchaser: I thought hangfire was more for long running tasks
[19:45:28] *** Joins: BSaboia (~bsaboia@177.37.198.227)
[19:45:29] <MatthiasVance> shadowchaser: So maybe it works at a higher level in the application (and not the HttpClient level)
[19:45:56] <MatthiasVance> So if there's a retry mechanism "try to do X", then that might make sense as well in the big picture
[19:46:02] <edcba> here i'm using polly+rabbitmq
[19:46:30] <shadowchaser> MatthiasVance it's used to retry given method which does http request and other things
[19:48:00] <Nasp> Throw message on a bus and let it handle it
[19:49:10] <edcba> yeah throw the call under a bus if it doesn't survive someone will create a ticket maybe
[19:50:07] <edcba> anyway the question is how long do you want to retry and what if your app crash in meantime
