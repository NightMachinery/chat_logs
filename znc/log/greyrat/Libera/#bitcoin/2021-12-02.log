[17:54:36] <jess> well, if you'd like to get a phd in psychology, by all means

[17:54:58] <Librarian> Fortunately that extent isn't necessary. We can learn the signs as laypeople, at home.
[17:56:13] <Librarian> In fact it's a service that's often provided to, say, victims of domestic abuse to help them recognize when they should get out of a dangerous situation.

[22:25:35] <skipper> atleaset they can add libera since that website is very old and famous

[22:45:18] <jess> luke-jr: but can i do it anyway?
[22:45:22] <jess> transparency and all that.
[22:45:26] <luke-jr> jess: I don't recall it, so rather not
[22:45:30] <jess> :)
[22:45:42] <buZz> wouldnt that log -aid- your recollection then?
[22:45:51] <luke-jr> jess: are you willing to let #anime move off freenode to Libera? that's ultimately all that matters
[22:46:01] <luke-jr> buZz: if it wasn't a waste of time
[22:46:17] <jess> the outcome of that discussion hasn't changed, if you're currently admitting your only beef with libera chat is #anime then i'd ask you to stop saying we destroyed freenode
[22:46:17] <buZz> recollection isnt a waste of time , it leads to insight in your own actions
[22:46:39] <luke-jr> jess: how didn't you? it was fine up until you guys did stuff
[22:46:40] <earnest> luke-jr: Bypassing all of this drama stuff, I think the only real question is whether or not #bitcoin should continue to exist on freenode given its current state or not; I don't mind either way but hoping to cut through the noise
[22:46:40] <buZz> and possibly remorse over time
[22:46:43] <jess> don't let that one thing colour your opinion of what happened, it sounds dishonest :)
[22:46:49] <luke-jr> jess: also, that wasn't even the first time you stole a channel

[22:49:46] <luke-jr> I have better things to do
[22:49:53] <zemzem> this is high quality content
[22:50:03] <buZz> like argueing #anime should exist as non-anime channel
[22:50:16] <earnest> buZz: Isn't the behaviour in question regarding the management of the channel, being hostile towards bitcoin, rather than politics
[22:50:21] <luke-jr> it is an anime channel too
[22:50:34] <buZz> earnest: totally, but the behaviour is catered by staff
[22:50:40] <luke-jr> just stuck on freenode because of Libera hypocrisy
[22:50:41] <buZz> which makes it political
[22:50:52] <buZz> luke-jr: why not make it a 100% anime channel
[22:51:03] <buZz> and just start #animedevs or something next to it?
[22:51:12] <buZz> sounds like jess was willing towards that
[22:51:14] <luke-jr> buZz: won't help
[22:51:17] <buZz> why not
[22:51:36] <luke-jr> then it's just off-topic
[22:51:46] <buZz> anime is offtopic in #anime ?
[22:51:46] <luke-jr> and then Libera staff won't let it move for that reason
[22:51:51] <luke-jr> off-topic on the network
[22:52:01] * buZz looks at ##gardening 
[22:52:14] <buZz> is that off-topic on the network too? its started by libera opers
[22:52:54] <luke-jr> complain to Libera staff for more hypocrisy I guess
[22:53:07] <buZz> what would i complain about? i like ##gardening
[22:53:17] <earnest> buZz: Do you think offtopic channels are allowed if 'unofficial' (##)?
[22:53:17] <luke-jr> for the hypocrisy, not the channel :P
[22:53:45] <buZz> earnest: that would make more sense to me, but some 'off interest' channels are single # too
[22:53:54] <NetSysFire> as long as it doesnt violate the network policies, everthing offtopic is allowed in "unofficial" channels
[22:53:54] <buZz> like #steamlug , is clearly about proprietary software
[22:54:09] <earnest> Yeah that's not very consistent, but oh well
[22:54:23] * NetSysFire has a channel in which a specific videogame genre is discussed
[22:54:28] <buZz> right, so there's plenty of leeway (hahaha what a pun)
[22:54:41] <earnest> buZz: Seems like ##anime could easily exist then, single or double
[22:54:42] <buZz> NetSysFire: #rtsfps? :D
[22:54:50] <buZz> earnest: i bet it does :P
[22:54:56] <luke-jr> ##anime might be okay, but that's the channel Libera gave to the hostile takeover
[22:55:02] <buZz> and it does, ##anime has 200 people inside
[22:55:28] <NetSysFire> buZz: hah, no
[22:55:29] <Maximalist> I dont understand what a "hostile takeover" of an IRC channel really means
[22:55:46] <buZz> Maximalist: i guess 'it already exists and i have no ops!'
[22:55:49] <NetSysFire> buZz: but in that direction, yeah. naming wise atleast. and with another #
[22:55:51] <luke-jr> Maximalist: staff gave malicious third parties ops instead of the legit founder
[22:55:52] <earnest> Maximalist: It means the channel owner being replaced without consent
[22:55:57] <buZz> NetSysFire: np :)
[22:56:05] <buZz> luke-jr: whats malicious about them?
[22:56:22] <luke-jr> buZz: taking over the channel with dishonest tactics
[22:56:32] <buZz> amigojapan is malicious?
[22:56:37] <earnest> Maximalist: (You can typically find that information from /q chanserv help)
[22:56:40] <buZz> dude, that user is -superfriendly-
[22:56:45] <buZz> i've spoken to them often
[22:56:50] <buZz> its like the inverse of zoltan
[22:56:59] <luke-jr> nevertheless, he participated in this bad thing
[22:57:12] <buZz> in what bad thing , the thing you said 'might be okay' ?
[22:57:19] <luke-jr> buZz: in taking over #anime
[22:57:27] <luke-jr> and forcing the real channel to remain on freenode
[22:57:40] <buZz> so, you agree that ##anime might be okay, and it exists by users from #anime before
[22:57:55] <luke-jr> no, #anime remains on freenode because of Libera's actions
[22:57:57] <buZz> so , whats malicious about it? it seems to even be about coding
[22:58:07] <buZz> the actions which you say are okay, noted
[22:58:09] <luke-jr> ##anime here is a hostile takeover
[22:58:15] <luke-jr> I didn't say they are okay
[22:58:19] <buZz> how can it be hostile -and- okay
[22:58:25] <buZz> 20:24:56 < luke-jr> ##anime might be okay
[22:58:26] <luke-jr> I said the channel name might be okay
[22:58:32] <buZz> and it exists
[22:58:34] <luke-jr> why are you cutting it out of context
[22:58:36] <buZz> as the channel
[22:58:40] <luke-jr> no, it doesn't
[22:58:44] <luke-jr> it exists as a hostile takeover
[22:58:54] <luke-jr> #anime remains on freenode still as a result
[22:59:18] <NetSysFire> i think you are both going in circles

[23:11:54] <jess> I'm willing to bet bitcoin-public-domain is zoltan
[23:11:55] <luke-jr> depends on if freenode gets their act together and restores it or not

[23:14:23] <luke-jr> I'm not sure the claim is even true
[23:14:30] <luke-jr> did Satoshi ever use freenode?
[23:14:51] <jess> well, bitcoin initially used freenode to bootstrap the blockchain
[23:14:54] <luke-jr> no
[23:14:56] <jess> so i'd be surprised
[23:15:00] <luke-jr> it was some other network iirc

[23:25:49] <Victorsueca> luke-jr: IIRC Bitcoind used to use #bitcoin on freenode to bootstrap peers. It was removed many years ago and replaced by a DNS seed precisely because the channel being taken over was always a possibility to consider.
[23:27:14] <Victorsueca> I also recall some clients joining the channel with bitcoind's user agent long after IRC bootstrapping was deprecated, so someone had to set a ban on that user agent with a reason explaining that it was deprecated.

[23:35:33] <luke-jr> there is no value to POW itself

[23:35:57] <Maximalist> without that input bitcoin would be worthless
[23:36:05] <Maximalist> cant create value from nothing
[23:36:51] <Librarian> Yep. So the value of bitcoin depends on its security, which depends on electricity.

[23:37:04] <Librarian> Pretty cool design.
[23:37:28] <earnest> Science fiction often uses the idea of using energy as a form of currency

[23:41:08] <Common> yup i did a quit PoS search on the page
[23:41:08] <Common> ty
[23:41:35] <Librarian> But every time you point out to him that bitcoin is open source, so if it's based on nothing he should be able to create 10,000 of them out of thin air immediately, he shuts up and goes away
[23:41:49] <Librarian> And then comes back weeks later and says it again.
[23:42:15] <earnest> Common: I don't know if anyone has written anything more indepth about the relationship between 'work' and the security of the numbers of our screens, but I'll keep an eye out
[23:42:32] <Librarian> So you gotta kind of keep on his ass: "Have you created your 10,000 bitcoins out of thin air, and sold them to become the richest person in the world yet? No? Oh, okay, we must be correct that its value is dependent on electricity and processing capability instead."
[23:43:16] <Common> yeah i guess there isnt as much of protection because its PoW but a much greater incentive to act in accordance to the protocol
[23:43:33] <earnest> Hm, but value is subjective.  There are many things to value about bitcoin besides that, but there is an implicit relationship to how security is obtained while maintaining open access
[23:44:10] <Common> in a PoS system do stakers have less of an incentive to act fairly?
[23:44:13] <Librarian> Yeah, some people don't care at all about not inflating the supply. They're doing just fine with their Dogecoin.
[23:44:29] <earnest> Common: "Security through incentive", I note this a few times and is one of the most facinating aspects
[23:44:44] <Librarian> Common, define "fairly." Wait, no, you can't: you don't have proof-of-your-own-stake. So what you think defines "fairly" is irrelevant.
[23:44:57] <earnest> Common: I think PoS has existed long enough to demonstrate these flaws already
[23:45:29] <Librarian> I have a dollar-denominated savings account, but even though I have *some* stake, I don't have *enough* to prevent the people who control the dollar supply from inflating it and stealing its purchasing power from me.
[23:45:33] <earnest> Remember, PoS is fiat, and fiat is "by decree" (usually by a king).  I'm not trying to associate it with dollars insofar as it's also fiat
[23:45:35] <Librarian> I define that as "unfair," but they don't care.

[23:46:31] <earnest> Common: PoS systems have showen us that a few can make radical decisions, splitting the network, changing the quantity of tokens, etc. on whim.  Something to be mindful of I think is to note how many of these 'altcoins' are usually just companies
[23:46:33] *** Quits: Talkless (~Talkless@mail.dargis.net) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[23:46:59] <Common> so almost like the large stakers with more stake can fork without interference?
[23:47:23] <earnest> This has happened
[23:47:50] <Common> lol how are people so fucking blind
[23:47:52] <zemzem> its crazy how easily Vitalik can make changes to ETH
[23:47:57] <Common> disgusting
[23:47:58] <zemzem> like crazy easy
[23:48:11] <Librarian> Who says it's "blind?" They know exactly what they're doing.
[23:48:23] <zemzem> Librarian with the syntax
[23:48:43] <earnest> Common: If you think of 'crypto' as a bubble, just as dotcom was a bubble, be careful not to be holding pets.com when it pops :P
[23:48:46] <Librarian> Oh, you talking about *us* who don't have sufficient "stake" to stop them? Yeah, agreed: that's why so many of us are here doing this, and not there doing that with them.
[23:49:59] <earnest> It's pretty clear that many people are using it as an investment opportunity, to try and gamble a bit like they would in currency markets.  There's going to be so much distortion, and it's probably necessary.  I hope bitcoin takes a long, long time to adopt because I'm more concerned that sudden shocks can break its fragile state
[23:50:42] <Common> do you think enough social engineering could be done to sway the masses off of the PoW bitcoin chain?
[23:50:50] <earnest> (It's a very interesting project, combining some of the hardest aspects of computer software, combined with game theory)
[23:51:07] <Librarian> Common, it's been tried a few times.
[23:51:13] <zemzem> is bitcoin's 'state' still considered to be extremely fragile?
[23:51:15] <earnest> Common: I've come to realise that the masses don't really matter, they will do what they're told
[23:51:24] <earnest> (And most, correctly, don't care about these details either)
[23:51:25] <Librarian> There's still an ongoing namespace-collision-attack attempt underway (for several years now) as we speak.
[23:51:50] <earnest> zemzem: I think it's fragile simply because it hasn't been substantially attacked yet
[23:52:05] <Librarian> And, humorously, the attacking faction has undergone many additional forks ever since, suffering under the same internal dishonesty and centralization attempts.
[23:52:18] <earnest> Literally all countries could, via UN cooporation or whatever, ban it.
[23:52:24] <Common> so if im sooo entwined on PoW i would just follow that fork even if its not the largest fork of bitcoin, is that my only hope if a social engineering attack is sucessful in changing away from PoW
[23:52:28] <earnest> That might not matter technically, but it does socially

[23:53:48] <Common> yeah, got me thinking lol
[23:54:18] <earnest> I think that bitcoin has resisted all of them is probably a testament to its stability, or resistence to change at least
[23:54:22] <Librarian> Speaking of which, what's up with Craig Wright's trial? When is that supposed to start up again?
[23:54:38] <earnest> See BCH, or some attempt to make mining easier, etc.
[23:55:30] <earnest> Some of the forks were to speed up transactions, but honestly lightning is probably better because it uses bitcoin as the baselayer
[23:55:56] <earnest> Common: Apparently there are a 105 forks lol
[23:56:00] <Common> yeah ive been in the space a while, but ive been kind of worrying about large scale social attempts, larger than blocksize war
[23:56:10] <Common> 105 forks off of BCH?!?!
[23:56:15] <earnest> bitcoin
[23:56:20] <earnest> Apparently 74 considered active
[23:56:36] <Common> their poor autistic souls
[23:56:51] <earnest> It's dotcom bubble again, many pets.com, only one google.com
[23:57:39] <Common> ahh i see the metaphor now
[23:57:46] <Common> im from the early 90s lol
[23:57:50] <Common> so that didnt all matter to me at the time
[23:57:59] <earnest> I didn't live through the dotcom bubble either

[23:58:33] <Common> you run a lightning node?

[23:58:42] <Common> ahhh
[23:58:52] <Common> im looking for some larger well connected nodes to link with
