[07:11:06] <jarthur> P2WPKH txes interpreted by segwit-aware clients have a slightly smaller scriptPubKey. That could be part of what you're thinking about in that last bit: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/10/28/segwit-costs/#serialisation-costs
[07:11:16] <luke-jr> but applying the discount to pre-segwit sigs *and* allowing blocks >1MB would be a hardfork

[19:56:43] <Diablo-D3> one of them is a 486 under his bed
[19:57:30] <the-scientist> no, he is renting a server for $50 / month
[19:58:17] <jarthur> BUSY re "<BUSY> yea i realized that you have at least one more merkle root, right[?]", if you're talking about the existing/main merkle tree, it would probably be more accurate to say it adds one more leaf or leaf level. Sorry you didn't get a response to that, I had to remember back to where the witness commitment lived.

[20:10:10] <bugs_> china broke before the network did
[20:10:16] <the-scientist> Digital Currency Group is a hostile entity and so they pool the Foundry USA poses a significant threat to Bitcoin especially because they making deals with the U.S. government

[20:26:45] <buZz> or any tax payer in US would be hostile
[20:26:52] <the-scientist> China China China China Russia Russia Russia China Iran Iran Chinaaa, every day every community, the Bitcoin community and all other community repeating this mantra like some zombie who can't speak other words. It is not China who want to murder Julian Assange

[20:27:12] <buZz> the-scientist: oh, hi zoltan
[20:27:12] <the-scientist> yes buZz it is severe hostile entity if its deals with the U.S. government
[20:27:24] <buZz> every taxpayer deals with US gov
[20:27:28] <buZz> every US taxpayer
[20:27:35] <the-scientist> and everyone is upset
[20:27:38] <buZz> hell, even many that arent paying tax
[20:27:54] <buZz> so? its their nation, their elected gov gives them the program they voted for

[20:28:04] <the-scientist> lol
[20:28:05] <buZz> seemingly guns and violence and oppression , w/e
[20:28:25] <buZz> yes i agree, twoparty systems are just communism with extra steps
[20:28:40] <s1gyn> redstar loves communism though
[20:28:44] <earnestly> The trick is understanding how it is, in fact, a one party system
[20:29:00] <NetSysFire> s1gyn: what about redstar OS? the north korea thing which is actually real
[20:29:15] <s1gyn> I've never tried it
[20:29:23] <earnestly> https://sizeof.cat/post/fun-with-redstar-os/
[20:29:25] <s1gyn> probably has spyware
[20:29:26] <buZz> i like communities
[20:29:38] <buZz> and communally organised camps etc
[20:29:50] <buZz> so i'm probably big comrad already
[20:30:01] <s1gyn> That sounds more like left anarchism
[20:30:08] <s1gyn> which doesn't require violence
[20:30:17] <buZz> s1gyn: yeah if you dont appoint leaders it would be anarchism
[20:30:29] <s1gyn> unlike communism under the marxist definition.
[20:30:33] <buZz> usually those camps etc are >3000 ppl , so need some kinda hierachy
[20:30:37] <buZz> right
[20:30:38] <s1gyn> which by it's nature involves violence
[20:31:00] <buZz> but even here, -i- dont consider myself 'leader' over you , just because i have +o access and you dont (i think)
[20:31:41] <buZz> and i'd fear to see myself grabbing to the 'gun' just to get ppl to listen to me

[20:42:44] <buZz> but so many of such forums lack export-whole-forum functions
[20:43:05] <buZz> if they had such functions (possibly open to archive.org even?) those forums could be revived later
[20:43:53] <NetSysFire> discourse is an okay forums software. its a bit gamified but still okay-ish since it actually tries to make you contribute to the specific community (not discourse) more
