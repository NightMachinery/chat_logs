[02:27:30] <e1f> there was a resurgence of westerns on tv too, in the 50s because people were tired of war movies
[02:27:56] <BrokenCog> there was a HUGE production of Westerns during the 50s.  and there were DOZENs of TV Western shows.
[02:28:06] <e1f> but definitely not /all/
[02:28:41] <e1f> all three networks had a western show in the 50s
[02:28:42] <BrokenCog> hodapp: that's the "inspiration" for Blazing Saddles ... such a glut of mono-story plots.

[02:33:06] <hodapp> thanks, I'll read
[02:33:19] <hodapp> I had seen that movie some dozen times when I learned that the Blazing Saddles theme song was written by someone who was never told that the movie was a joke
[02:33:34] <hodapp> which is probably part of why it sounds so perfect
[02:34:12] <BrokenCog> hah!  I didn't know that.  yeah, I don't think one could knowingly write such a perfectly appropriately inappropriate song
[02:34:48] <BrokenCog> Brooks was a genius like that.  wasn't he known for telling some cast to "ad lib" and not let others know?
[02:35:00] *** Quits: dot0 (~dot0@user/dot0) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:35:09] <BrokenCog> maybe I'm confusing that with the Carol Burnnett Show, which did a lot of ad-lib because of the live set recording.
[02:35:12] <hodapp> I hadn't heard that about him, only Kubrick
[02:35:22] <BrokenCog> oh, mabye that's where.
[02:35:38] <hodapp> supposedly, almost all of Dr. Strange
[02:35:48] <BrokenCog> supposedly.
[02:35:55] <hodapp> ...Dr. Strangelove was done that way - the actors were told they were just doing a warm-up and to be as over-the-top as possible
[02:36:04] <BrokenCog> it's too well scripted to me to be adlib but ... who knows.  those were some very talented people.
[02:36:44] <BrokenCog> ah, maybe they had scripts but with blanks and then the improved the characters persona.  that woudl fit with the movie for sure.

[04:32:05] <Ox151> hello, does anyone use the package Dashboard with org-agenda? I am trying to get the dashboard agenda view to show the date attached to the current task, but it doesnt show it. And example of what i mean is https://www.philnewton.net/assets/blog/2021/emacs-dashboard.png i tried `dashboard-agenda-prefix-format` but org-agenda-prefix-format doesnt seem to have a date variable, only time-of-day seen here

[04:35:48] <TRS-80> Ox151: Maybe I am misunderstanding, but do you have SCHEDULED, DEADLINE, or an active timestamp in the items?  I don't know about Dashboard, but that is required for a date to appear in regular agenda anyway.
[04:36:24] <TRS-80> grym: It's a bit 'weird' at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's awesome IMO.  Not unlike Emacs itself.  :D

[06:32:24] <e1f> so edgar-rft 's example should do what you want

[06:32:53] <edgar-rft> the avantage of using add-to-list instead of push is that add-to-list only adds key/value pairs that do not alreay exist in the alist, but therefore it needs to traverse the list like append

[08:03:52] <gnoo> (in the call to sv)

[08:04:35] <gnoo> the file, chmod +x ~/service/service_name/run
[08:06:20] <gnoo> you'll get error about environment variables soon enough, so it's better to either start it with your shell during login (in say ~/.bash_profile) or if you use a de, use ~/.config/autostart instead of using /etc/sv/runsvdir-username. although keep using the current one until it stops working
[08:08:07] <Guest63> oh
[08:09:02] <Guest63> i added `exec /home/sere/emacs/bin/emacs --daemon` into bash_profile i should  reboot now

[08:09:37] <Guest63> libgccjit ;(
[08:10:04] <gnoo> remove that line. by start in ~/.bash_profile, i mean the runsvdir call that you've put in /etc/sv/runsvdir-username
[08:10:47] <gnoo> or just `touch /etc/sv/runsvdir-username/down' and then in bash_profile, assuming you login in tty1, put:
[08:11:47] <gnoo> [[ $(tty) = /dev/tty1 ]] && { /etc/sv/runsvdir-username/run & disown ; }
[08:11:48] <Guest63> I've removed runsvdir-sere .
[08:11:58] <Guest63> I'm using xfce
[08:12:19] <gnoo> oh, then just use ~/.config/autostart/runsvdir.desktop
[08:12:53] <gnoo> .desktop files are not shell scripts so you should search how to write one
[08:13:09] <Guest63> oh thank you
[08:13:21] <gnoo> and in the Exec= line, use `runsvdir /home/username/service'
[08:15:11] <Guest63> I've created on login autostart from session and startup in xfce.
[08:15:12] <gnoo> Guest63: subnut in #voidlinux has some instruction to use libgccjit, you should ask there. you left before he responded

[10:48:15] <bpalmer> I am curious
[10:49:12] <bpalmer> After all, they're giving away free games every day/week
[10:49:14] <aidalgol> I think brand loyalty to Steam was a large part, but they rubbed a lot of people the wrong way with their strategy of buying (timed) exclusive rights to a lot of new releases.
[10:49:59] <aidalgol> They were (and still are, I think) also lacking some really basic features, which greatly frustrated the people who *were* trying it out, such as no shopping cart.
[10:49:59] <bpalmer> BUt they don't mind xbox/playstation/nintendo doing the same thing?
[10:50:09] <aidalgol> no, because brand loyalty
[10:50:23] <aidalgol> It is particularly strong in that industry.
[10:51:12] <aidalgol> The excuse for why it's OK when console vendors do it is because it "helps the platform".
[10:51:17] <aidalgol> which makes no sense
[10:51:53] <aidalgol> There's also an element of "fuck Tencent", but that seems to be the least significant factor.

[18:04:29] <Guest63> rpav , i want to natively compile emacs , so i need libgccjit, but i want alternative to libgccjit
[18:04:44] <bjc> i don't think there's an alternative to libgccjit
[18:05:13] <rpav> i'm not sure why one would think an alternative could even be possible in this case
[18:05:26] <wasamasa> either you enable native comp by providing libgccjit or you don't use native comp at all
[18:05:51] <rpav> i guess emacs provides a bunch of options for other libraries like GUI so maybe it's not a hugely unreasonable thought

[20:29:24] <afidegnum> yes, I know, but at times, representing a model to the client is kind of complicated for him to grasp, instead, he needs a wireframe or a template he can be comfortable in viewing how the design will be upfront before implementation, hence hence the purpose of adding data points so if the client agrees, I can then build up a model from what's being discussed.

[21:59:50] <technomancy> bjc: I think of it more as a parasitic relationship; open source appropriates a protective coating of "openness" and you end up with a situation where (for example) facebook is thoroughly user-hostile and yet contributes huge amounts of code to "the commons" without that free licensing having a slightest beneficial impact to actual humans.

[22:02:21] <technomancy> the open license is of zero social benefit

[22:03:44] <bjc> my issue with a lot of corporate open source is that they work with it long enough to get their system working, then try to get patches upstream to externalize the maintenance burden. it's parasitic

[22:07:37] <lemacs> I wanted to do in the file buffer itself
[22:07:46] <cvandusen> git-gutter does that.
[22:07:57] <lemacs> cvandusen know the command on git-gutter? I use vc-diff because git-gutter was buggy here
