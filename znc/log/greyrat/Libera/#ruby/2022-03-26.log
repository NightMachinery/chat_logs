[02:09:09] <a1eaiactaest> hello, anyone has experience in writing homebrew formulas?
[02:26:08] <weaksauce> a1eaiactaest just ask and if someone knows they will help you
[02:28:24] <a1eaiactaest> ok, so im trying to write home brew formula but it's downloading all files from tor, and my question is it possible by ruby to launch tor browser in background (it enables sock5 proxy) and then download it as

[02:29:15] <a1eaiactaest> and download from .onion site zip file, rest is trivial
[02:29:46] <a1eaiactaest> short: homebrew formula but get files from .onion site
[02:33:33] <weaksauce> should be able to since it's just ruby
[02:34:01] <ox1eef> i suggest checking if tor service is enabled, and if it is not tell the user to connect to the tor network / enable the tor service. there is no easy way to do it with the browser, youd have to try control it remotely. so the easiest way is to bail and inform.

[02:35:04] *** Joins: jmcgnh (~jmcgnh@wikipedia/jmcgnh)
[02:36:30] <a1eaiactaest> so if user doesnt have tor enabled just print something like: run tor browser in background for example and then do the rest?
[02:37:16] <ox1eef> does the tor browser have to be used? because that is enabling tor for one process, the tor service would be better
[02:41:17] <a1eaiactaest> well, something that enables socks5 proxy. I know tor browser does. don't know about tor service tho.
[02:41:57] <a1eaiactaest> what about https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tor
[02:42:02] <a1eaiactaest> it's not tor-browser
[02:44:49] <a1eaiactaest> contacted a friend, he says that only running a tor service would technicaly work.

[03:02:18] <a1eaiactaest> if not there could be a way to do it in ruby. new to ruby so i don't know much about it. gonna learn a lot in next few days for sure
[03:03:17] <ox1eef> if you want to go that route then id look into remote debugging options on FF.
[03:03:42] <a1eaiactaest> what is FF?
[03:04:04] <ox1eef> chrome has something similar, and on top of it chrome-driver was built, which you can use to control the browser from code.
[03:04:09] <ox1eef> FF means FireFox
[03:04:16] <a1eaiactaest> ok
[03:04:37] <a1eaiactaest> no i just want it to run in the background so proxy is enabled
[03:05:18] <ox1eef> https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home
[03:05:27] <ox1eef> sounds like firefox would have something similar
[03:06:35] <ox1eef> seems over the top for a homebrew formula though
[03:07:16] <weaksauce> you could use applescript to figure out if tor is around
[03:07:21] <weaksauce> and tell it to open
[03:08:04] <weaksauce> write a custom function that does the checking and opening. firefox probably has headless too but not sure 
[03:08:41] <weaksauce> applescript is pretty awful though
[03:09:50] <a1eaiactaest> ox1eef mantioned it eariler: browser could be unnecessary, tor service could make a job
[03:10:27] <a1eaiactaest> wait a minute i'll test it
[03:11:00] <ox1eef> apple script was a cool idea
[03:13:34] <a1eaiactaest> oh i think i figured it out
[03:13:44] <a1eaiactaest> is there a way in ruby to call curl?
[03:13:59] <a1eaiactaest> something like system()
[03:17:42] <weaksauce> sure you can use system or `` i imagine or even popen if you need something stronger 
[03:17:57] <a1eaiactaest> great
[03:18:28] <weaksauce> osascript is what you'd want to use for scripting 
[03:18:33] <weaksauce> if you go that route
[03:18:55] <weaksauce> guess it depends on how robust you are trying to make it
[03:21:23] <a1eaiactaest> if everything goes as planned i'll send you PR link tomorrow or day after
[03:21:28] <a1eaiactaest> thanks for help!
