[04:54:13] <xx> nothing about locale stuff though
[04:54:36] <xx> anyway, onto another problem: I have PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" in my ~/.profile
[04:54:52] <xx> but when I start xterm or xfce4-terminal, it starts a bash that doesn't have that in the PATH

[04:57:07] <xx> (but even non-login shells should already use what's set up in the environment before they get started, and PATH should be set up)
[04:59:16] <tomreyn> maybe you have ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login so that bash won't read ~/.profile

[06:12:55] *** Quits: faktor (~factor@72.192.71.12) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:13:17] <xx> because it is not actually set when I'm then starting new shells with setpriv, so I wanted to know what actually sources that file and when
[06:14:02] <xx> and that's causing problems because everything then assumes I don't have utf8
[06:14:33] <Blondie101010> what is the command you run?
[06:15:04] <Blondie101010> environment variables are not passed magically from one program to another, they are passed by how the program is executed
[06:15:04] <xx> `setpriv --reset-env -- bash -l`
[06:15:29] <Blondie101010> hmmm, and when you `echo $LANG` in there it's empty?
[06:15:33] <xx> yes
[06:16:20] <xx> so my login shells are not actually running whatever is necessary to source the /etc/default/locale in order to have LANG set
[06:16:24] <xx> hence I went looking for it
[06:16:34] <Blondie101010> does it do the same without '--reset-env'?
[06:16:58] <xx> without --reset-env, LANG remains whatever it was before
[06:20:56] <xx> it's a bit weird, but it looks like a default installation of debian11, running xfce/lightdm, uses lightdm init file to source LANG into the whole environment that comes afterwards

[17:00:14] <dvs> heh
[17:03:07] <xx> is it even possible to tell whether the next pull of the trigger will shoot by the change in weight distribution of the revolver due to the single round in it?
[17:03:27] * xx is looking to cheat at russian roullete
[17:03:52] <Khepra> just use a Nagant M1895 and your chances of survival increase
[17:04:11] <xx> heh
[17:04:17] <PMT> Cheating at Russian Roulette sounds like a good way to get the other players to play all remaining rounds against your skull if caught.
[17:04:18] <Khepra> or LeMat :)
[17:04:22] <amacater_> Get the gun handed to you by the on set armourer and ... ?
[17:04:29] <xx> though with that one you can see whether the round is in the right spot
[17:04:44] <xx> PMT: that's a very good point that I haven't considered
[17:05:08] <xx> amacater_: too soon
[17:05:27] <Khepra> Where's the Soon(tm) cat

[17:06:23] <at0m> ok #d-o
[17:06:37] <PMT> we probably don't need a detailed account, just the key bullets. :P
[17:06:43] <amacater_> If there is only one round and the revolver is very well oiled and maintained - in theory, the round should always drop to the bottom when you spin it, so you're a couple of rounds away ...
[17:07:13] <Khepra> that theory is patently wrong
[17:07:56] <amacater_> At least one person has tried Russian roulette with a Browning 9mm semi-automatic ... that up's the certainty :(
[17:08:01] <sussudio> i'd just fill it up. play stupid games, get stupid prizes.

[23:35:09] <dadinn> I am trying to boot Debian LiveCD in Qemu/KVM, and interact with it through serial console using expect. I've managed to get it working by waiting for the "Booting Debian Installer with Speech syntesis..." text, pressing tab, and sending " console=ttyS0\n". Afterwards everything is printed on the terminal, and I can interact with it. Now I am trying to use UEFI boot option by passing "-bios
[23:35:15] <dadinn> /usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd" option to qemu-system-x86-64. The proble is that it seems GRUB doesn't print stuff on serial console anymore :(
[23:35:54] <dadinn> Is there any way to get GRUB to print on serial console even when booted in UEFI bios?

[23:56:07] <sney> SpeakerToMeat: there are a few ways to back up the list of installed packages, I prefer the one with aptitude:
[23:56:12] <sney> !aptitude clone
[23:56:12] <dpkg> To clone a Debian machine using aptitude (or install your favourite packages) use aptitude search --disable-columns -F%p '~i!~M!~v' > package_list; on the reference machine; xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < package_list; aptitude install; on the other machine.  This preserves information about "automatically installed" packages that other methods do not.  See also <reinstall>, <things to backup>, <debian clone>, <apt-clone>.

[23:56:33] <sney> but as the bot suggests, it's only needed if you are trying to copy your debian install to other systems, it's not really a typical step
[23:56:38] <somiaj> SpeakerToMeat: you don't need to save a list of installed packages, but it is one thing you can do.

[23:57:12] <somiaj> Since in my setup, 95% of the packages are dependencies of what I need, I usually just focus on the names of the small 5% (or less) main/meta packages I use.
[23:57:29] <somiaj> and I just prefer to reinstall them vs pull in the full list

[23:58:37] <vlt> dadinn: I create a live CD with a running openssh-server (and dhclient).
[23:58:43] <SpeakerToMeat> sney, the issue is this, I'm installing a debian on docker for a friend. And in case we ever upgrade or have to reinstall I want to restore all installed packages easily.... I guess I don't mind a list of everything installed including what's in base since if I reinstall based on that list everythign that's there already, will be ignored. But I wonder, with this I would need to crontab the process.
[23:58:45] <SpeakerToMeat> Is there anything built in instead? if not, I'll crontab it.
[23:59:10] <SpeakerToMeat> somiaj, the problem with that approach (which is ok) is that we need a human to be on top of the ball, to remember adding the right packages to the list by hand
[23:59:24] <SpeakerToMeat> I think I'll crontab the command sney shared
[23:59:32] <sney> yep, that seems viable
