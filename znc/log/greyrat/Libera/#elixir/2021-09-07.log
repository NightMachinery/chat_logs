[13:41:27] <hauleth> Hmmm… I think that `Code.put_compiler_option(:warnings_as_errors, true)` in `test_helper.exs` should be default
[13:45:13] <Nicd> so I use :httpc in a mix task and it gives a warning "warning: :httpc.request/4 defined in application :inets is used by the current application but the current application does not depend on :inets.". but this is a development only task and the project otherwise doesn't depend on :inets
[13:45:31] <Nicd> I released the library as is but it warns about it for every user of that library too
[13:45:36] <Nicd> what's the proper solution for this?

[14:10:30] <el1x1r> Is it declared as a dev dependency? 
[14:11:18] <Nicd> no, because while the task is for development use, the actual library code is for production use

[16:26:33] <Nicd> hauleth: in the library? will it affect projects that use the library? what is the implication of it?
[16:27:41] <hauleth> Nicd: the implication is that `inets` will be included in release of such application (not started, just included)
[16:28:05] <Nicd> in a mix release?
[16:28:21] <hauleth> Yes
[16:28:32] <Nicd> but that's the opposite of what I want
[16:28:49] <Nicd> the mix task is not going to be in a mix release, there's no reason for inets to be in a release either
[16:29:05] <hauleth> Elixir do not know that
[16:29:42] <Nicd> feels like a hack to include unused applications in a release due to some deficiency / misunderstanding of Elixir
[16:30:04] <Nicd> I'd rather just see the warning and not include inets in the release for all library users for no reason
[16:30:12] <hauleth> Well, yes, but you cannot be sure that someone will not call given code in production as well
[16:30:45] <Nicd> they can't call a mix task in a release without doing some extra legwork and I'm not going to be responsible for that :P
[16:32:00] <hauleth> AFAIK there is no other solution right now
[16:33:08] <Nicd> that's a shame
[16:33:30] <Nicd> maybe I'll just write a shell script using curl instead

[18:53:23] <josevalim> Nicd: you can exclude per module
[18:53:32] <josevalim> `xref: [exclude: [:httpc]]`
[18:54:48] <Nicd> Exactly, I could make the same mistake with httpc in the rest of the actual code and it would be masked.
[18:54:54] <Nicd> Though I guess the chance is slim
[18:55:47] <josevalim> I see, you want to exclude this warning in particular, not all other warnings that may be related to httpc
[18:56:33] <Nicd> It may also be that I'm stupid and doing things I shouldn't
[18:57:28] <Nicd> But you can add language_colours 1.0.0 as dep, compile and it will complain. I'd like it not to do that.
[18:59:33] <josevalim> so, xref: [exclude: ...] is the way to go
[18:59:48] <josevalim> we might add a way to skip this warning in particular later on so you get the undefined function warnings still

[21:00:51] <hoppity> I want to make a search box where  a user can search for a name and then select the name from the found results and have the database ID for said name be sent to my live view. Can anyone point me in the right direction for this?
[21:01:08] *** Quits: bit4bit (~bit4bit@190.128.123.78) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[21:01:23] <hoppity> It is easy to implement the autocomplete, I already did that, but I can only send the name string back to my liveview I see no way to send the ID for said name.
[21:01:48] <benwilson512> hoppity: I mean you could have a hidden field that you populate but
[21:01:59] <benwilson512> how are you proposing you find the database ID?
[21:02:36] <hoppity> so when I mount my liveview I create an assign @names where my list of name maps resides
[21:02:48] <hoppity> and my plan was to use datalist with that
[21:03:14] <hoppity> the @names assign contains ID, name and last name for each name
[21:08:02] <hoppity> If I could add a phx-click to the suggestions that my search box already shows I could take it from there but haven't been able to find an example of this
[21:10:10] <Nicd> just adding phx-click doesn't work?
[21:11:32] <hoppity> Nicd: but would't that triger upon clicking the search box instead of triggering when clicking the suggestions?
[21:12:52] <Nicd> add the phx-click to the suggestion
[21:13:29] <hoppity> Nicd: that is what I am trying to figure out hwo to do but can't find examples or doc about it
[21:14:17] <Nicd> it would depend on how you are showing the suggestions
[21:14:57] <hoppity> Like this: https://dpaste.org/rnf5
[21:15:26] <Nicd> and it renders a datalist with option elements?
[21:16:26] <Nicd> or you render it yourself?
[21:16:29] <hoppity> https://dpaste.org/LG1Q
[21:16:36] <hoppity> that includes the datalist now
[21:17:02] <Nicd> did you try adding the phx-click to the option?

[21:23:30] <Nicd> looks like datalist options don't have good support for onclick :( https://stackoverflow.com/q/30022728
[21:24:44] <hoppity> thank you, I guess there isn't a good way to do this then :(
[21:25:20] <Nicd> you could try phx-change on the input element itself and other things like that. or hooks. but it might be hacky with datalist
[21:25:31] <benwilson512> hoppity: why is it a problem to send the name to the liveview and have it do the lookup/
[21:25:52] <hoppity> benwilson512: godd question, the reason is that you can have many people with the same name
[21:26:37] <benwilson512> how does the suggestion box distinguish between them?
[21:26:50] <hoppity> by database ID
[21:27:43] <hoppity> <option value="<%= match.id %>"><%= "#{match.unit_number} #{match.name} " %></option>
[21:28:13] <hoppity> btw I've been saying names but these are actually pieces of equipment
[21:28:27] <Nicd> I'd probably use a select element with something client side like select2
[21:30:01] <hoppity> I might just have to do something like that. I was considering phoenix_form_awesomplete but couldn't get it to work with the few documentation examples
[21:30:17] <benwilson512> hoppity: I guess I'm confused you talked about it being a text box w/ suggestions but now you also have a select box?
[21:30:37] <hoppity> no, there is not select box sorry if I caused confusion
[21:30:46] <Nicd> I think it's an autocomplete select field that they want
[21:31:18] <hoppity> ^ this describes it well
[21:31:22] <benwilson512> is `<option>` allowed under anything other than a select?
[21:31:56] <hoppity> I am currently using <option> to show suggestions unders my text field 
[21:32:02] <benwilson512> ah
[21:32:25] <benwilson512> that seems like a solid solution IMHO
[21:32:31] <hoppity> benwilson512: here is the exact implementation  https://dpaste.org/LG1Q
[21:33:43] <hoppity> And it does "work" but the problem is that when the user clicks on one of the displayed suggestions the ID for that suggestion gets put into the text field which confuses the user.
