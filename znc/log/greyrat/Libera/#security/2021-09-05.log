[04:00:26] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@106.203.195.217) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[04:01:03] <TimMc> If you put it in localstorage, then it's *definitely* susceptible to XSS.
[04:02:55] <Hash> TimMc: how?
[04:03:43] <shad> TimMc: react escapes anything you throw at it, so how would that work ?
[04:03:46] <TimMc> Well, there's only one way to get something into the localstorage, and that's via Javascript. So if you use localstorage for the token, it's basically by definition vulnerable to XSS (if there's a XSS vulnerability, of course).
[04:04:34] <shad> That's my point exactly, why do I bother with httpOnly cookies if the only threat to localStorage is XSS, if XSS cannot happen ?
[04:04:39] <TimMc> shad: While it is indeed wonderful that React escapes things for HTML by default, there can still be XSS vulnerabilities.
[04:05:18] <Hash> localStorage.getItem(someitem)
[04:05:26] <Hash> You need to know the item
[04:05:30] <Hash> For one
[04:05:40] <Hash> You need the unique identifier
[04:05:47] <TimMc> Sooner or later you allow an <a href="javascript:...">...</a> or use a library that uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML or some such.
[04:06:06] <Hash> I mean it's possible, to read/write local store with js, but I'm talking about cross site.
[04:06:27] <Hash> How exactly would that work? You'd have to disengage multiple types of internal protections
[04:06:35] <Hash> You have CORS for one
[04:06:43] <Hash> You have cross site js disabled by default
[04:06:48] <TimMc> Hash: "Cross site" is a misnomer. The name XSS is probably never going to go away, but it is better termed a "javascript injection vulnerability".
[04:06:55] <Hash> Ohhh
[04:06:57] <Hash> Ok.
[04:07:03] <Hash> Then I can see how it would work.
[04:07:08] <Hash> The whoel cross site confused me.
[04:07:22] <TimMc> Yeah, it's not a good name. :-/
[04:07:27] <Hash> Hey thanks
[04:07:29] <shad> I got my flask app to output a Ì€`Set-Cookie:  accessToken=eyjf....` header, but i don't know how does that work in a React PWA
[04:08:31] <TimMc> There's this newer feature that you can lean on, called SameSite cookies or something like that. It's a pretty solid CSRF protection, but only works in newer browsers. Worth it, though.
[04:08:39] <shad> I don't know how to set it as a `Authorization: Bearer ${cookies.accessToken}Ì€  nor how to move from the login page to the application reserved space
[04:09:04] <shad> That does work only if the API is behind the same host, which it isn't
[04:09:40] <shad> The idea is to have the front behind `shad.io` and the api at `api.shad.io`
[04:09:57] <Hash> I owned #crypto
[04:10:11] <Hash> The ##crypto people asked me to forward it, so I dropped it, let them manage it
[04:10:20] <Hash> I think ##crypto also moved to #crypto
[04:10:38] <shad> Also i want to deploy production in a kubernetes cluster, i don't know if it makes sense to still use cookies

[04:16:14] <TimMc> An HttpOnly cookie and appropriate CORS settings on the API server is probably sufficient.

[13:33:56] <tomreyn> theoretically, those could be anyone's code signing certificates just having "Corel" and "symantec" as a CN
[13:34:23] *** Joins: Enitin (~Enitin@82.102.22.86)
[13:35:35] <tomreyn> the "signature info" paragraph just states that the file is signed with a 'valid' signature, which can mean as much as that the signing certificate was available to verify that it had produced this signature, but it may not indicate at all that this signing certificate is trustable.
