[02:20:14] <DarkFeather> Joanna: not much. Just working on getting a body of work together to bypass the HR cybersec gatekeeping.
[02:21:15] <DarkFeather> "What do you do in your current role?" "PCI / vuln scan audits, NIST remediations, CVE escalations, devops and access control, firewalls..." "But  you don't have security in your job title." "No." "We decided to go with someone more aligned with the position." "Kay."
[02:21:32] <DarkFeather> Guess I'll go f' myself.

[02:59:42] <Joanna> DarkFeather: employers have always been like that. I bet the gate keepers don’t even know about security they are just given a checklist. I’ve seen those programming tests that people who have been programming for a long time can’t pass ...
[03:03:02] <Joanna> I once saw a test on oop and inheritance that someone was doing and it made no sense it was as if it was a test from some college textbook.
