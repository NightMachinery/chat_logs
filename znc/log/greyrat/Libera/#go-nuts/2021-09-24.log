[03:39:15] <bpalmer> As I understand (and after simple testing), you can't "promote" a read lock to a write lock with sync.RWMutex; you have to drop the read lock and then try to obtain the write lock
[03:39:42] <bpalmer> I don't suppose there's a common place mutex that supports this?
[03:40:55] <rewt> that can create a deadlock -- if 2 goroutines hold read locks, and both want to promote to write locks, they'll wait for each other to drop their read locks before they can get promoted
[03:41:08] <bpalmer> ... good point.
[03:41:44] <bpalmer> OK, I guess I don't want that after all :)

[07:14:05] <Seirdy> anybody know how i could make this a little less repetitive? https://termbin.com/kaq2
[07:14:25] <Seirdy> i just re-wrote something in Python that used generators
[07:14:57] <Seirdy> i know generics are in 1.18 but i wanna keep compatibility with 1.15+
[07:16:15] <Seirdy> essentially, i have an interface that i'm implementing by adding methods to a slice-based type that return new slices, each resulting slice being the result of calling the same method from each element.

[14:34:57] <Sam> go mod init should be creating a file called "go.mod". Go run creates a binary in /tmp or somewhere equivalent and then runs it.
[14:35:14] <Sam> go build would create the binary locally

[15:39:16] <Yukkuri> hi, regarding https://play.golang.org/p/ffwc2UqYNz0 implementation of closech() -- is there any issue (e.g. race condition, platform-dependence) other than being very poor architectural approach, for problem that is best solved by idiomatically closing channel at writing side?
[15:42:49] <Yukkuri> i.e. is it correct to treat chan as a pointer, as it follows reference semantics?

[15:46:00] <sztanpet> good question, i feel if the solution was "this easy", there would be official support
[15:49:20] <sztanpet> i thought i understood the problem you are trying to solve with this, but i realize i dont, can you define the problem to which this is the solution
[15:50:42] *** Joins: jaca122 (~Thunderbi@89-65-136-254.dynamic.chello.pl)
[15:51:54] <sztanpet> you dont want to panic on sending to a closed channel?
[15:53:24] <Yukkuri> in narrow scope, i want to atomically set channel variable to a nil, also closing this channel if previous value wasn't nil - as if closing on reading side a channel that is never being written to.
[15:54:34] <Yukkuri> in broader scope, i'm facing delibirate limitation of sync.Cond.Wait() API not acceptin any timeout to wait for condition and try to simulate same broadcast behavior by closing a channel, but as it happens concurrently - i need to make there wouldn't be closing of nil channel
[15:55:07] <Yukkuri> need to make sure*
[15:55:18] <Yukkuri> also to rearm the condition, a new channel would be needed
[15:58:03] <Yukkuri> as long as lines 15 and 16 have no issues with race conditions and `swappedch` is guaranteed to be channel before swap, rest is trivial.

[16:15:37] <sztanpet> no, it cannt
[16:16:02] <Yukkuri> at the same time, replacing atomic swaps with `swappedch, ch = ch, swappedch` produces race errors when executed with -race
[16:16:38] <Yukkuri> at very least it does detect obvious race condition in this case
[16:16:50] <sztanpet> yup yup

[16:20:14] <Yukkuri> well, i'm just bummed that sync.Cond.Wait() isn't havin any option to timeout the wait. this limitation was pointed out in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9578 but largelly ignored

[16:57:57] <Sam> Yah, I was going to say the same thing; if you want people to be able to use your project, please consider a more established, "real" license. MIT and BSD are basically the same thing, except they don't use colloquialisms and aren't meant as a joke.

[17:01:22] <Yukkuri> if nothing i do would be used by google, i can consider it only as a good thing
[17:02:28] <Sam> It can't be used by normal people either who in good faith want to use your work as intended under the law and don't want to risk a license that may or may not be enforceable depending on jurisdiction

[17:03:16] <Sam> I mean, I'm not against changing to a source available license to stop Google or whomever form using it, but do it in a way that only singles out big companies and what not, not in a way that's going to make normal people acting in good faith unsure what to do.
[17:03:47] <Yukkuri> with wtfpl there is  basically nothing to enforce
[17:04:07] <Sam> Maybe. Or maybe it's an invalid license in some jurisdictions and it means your works are fully copyrighted.
[17:04:24] <A_Dragon> WTFPL is radioactive until its tested in a court, which will be problematic
[17:04:46] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[17:04:56] <Sam> Right. License proliferation is bad; if you're serious about releasing your software, don't use somebodies joke and take it seriously.
[17:05:16] <Sam> That being said, I keep considering using the Commons Clause on new things recently and as far as I know it hasn't been tested either.
[17:05:33] <Sam> But it's at least a serious license vetted by some lawyers.

[17:19:08] <Tv_> Sam: CC wasn't meant for software though
[17:19:30] <siXy> MIT/BSD 3-clause are reasonable alternatives if you want the effect of wtfpl but want to write useful things.
[17:19:34] <Sam> I know, who said anything about CC?
[17:20:03] <siXy> If you dislike having your code used by big corps, AGPL is fairly effective
[17:20:13] <Sam> Oh, you mean the Commons Clause? It was made for software, that's not a Creative Commons thing
[17:20:21] <Tv_> Sam: sorry too early
[17:20:36] <Sam> AGPL also just hurts the little guy IMO. The network rule thing is just way too vague.
[17:20:52] <Sam> I mean, sure, it stops Google from using it, but it stops a lot of other people who are acting in good faith too.
[17:21:16] <siXy> I don't know why people are so worried about this. Google isn't gonna use your code anyway.
[17:21:44] <Tv_> Commons Clause seems to hurt the little guys too?
[17:21:45] <Sam> FWIW, the commons clause FAQ specifically states why it's not creative commons and why it's not AGPL :) I tend to agree with them, though again, I haven't used it yet because it's not widely used either which makes me cautious: https://commonsclause.com/
[17:22:04] <Sam> How so? I mean, it says, "don't sell" but in a clear way, not a way that's going to get a small person acting in good faith sued
[17:22:14] <Tv_> but at least Commons Clause it's 100% honest about not being "Open Source"
[17:22:39] <Tv_> Sam: oh sure, it might be less ambiguous, or differently ambiguous
[17:23:01] <Sam> I don't think it's differently ambiguous, it's pretty straight forward, uses all the normal words that have legal definitions, etc.
[17:23:12] <Tv_> but i have very little love for the "you don't get to host this" war
[17:25:06] <Tv_> Sam: i'm not 100% convinced this sentence is clear: "You just can’t sell a product that consists in substance of the Commons Clause software and does not add value."
[17:25:23] <Tv_> Sam: i changed the background color! value!
[17:25:46] <Sam> Yes, that's a normal thing for courts to decide. When you say "in substance" that is generally well litigated in most jurisdictions
[17:25:51] <Sam> That is how you write an actual legal license
[17:26:10] <Tv_> Sam: just saying, little guys cannot predict what the court will decide
[17:26:21] <Sam> That's not the point I was making though
[17:26:50] <Sam> The little guys don't *have* to because it's already been well litigated and you at least have the option of doing your research and making an informed decision. As opposed to the network thing which no one big or little knows what it means.
[17:27:17] <Tv_> i'm not 100% convinced it is. just recently France threw out the concept of enforcing licenses via copyright.
[17:27:24] <Sam> The little guy vs. big buy stuff was an entirely different point: on some licenses the big guy can say "yah, we probably can get away with using WTFPL because if they sue us we'll argue that it wasn't legally binding anyways", the little guy doesn't have the resources to do that
[17:27:40] <Sam> Sure, not in all jurisdictions, but this is literally how you have to write legal licenses and they are all written with this sort of vaguery.
[17:28:00] <Tv_> anyway, sorry, don't mean to rag on you. just read Commons Clause for the first time, and i have mixed feelings about this whole development in the ecosystem.
[17:28:07] <Sam> Otherwise you'd have to list every possible change for every possible bit of software, that obviously can't happen, so instead you use terms like "substantial portion" or a list of things that's non exaustive
[17:28:20] <Tv_> or you just don't go there...
[17:28:37] <Tv_> me, i wouldn't want to build an empire on Commons Clause *or* AGPL
[17:29:15] <Sam> I mean, if you don't care how your software is used yah, don't go there. If you're a business and don't want your thing sold but want nice people to be able to use it you've got to have some alternative.
[17:29:35] <Sam> Or, in my case, I just want Google (or whomever, I know literal Google won't be using my stuff most likely) to not be able to use it.
[17:29:50] <Sam> Although I wish there was a "unless you're a cooperative or non-profit, then you can sell it" license
[17:30:03] <Tv_> Sam: wouldn't that be more like a second license you offer to select parties
[17:30:23] <Sam> Tv_: yah, that's what I was thinking. Something like the commons clause except with that caveat

[17:30:58] <Sam> But something you add to an existing license so I could just do BSD or Apache and not have to worry about the new thing not being vetted or not being properly severable if the "don't sell" clause is bad somehow
[17:31:08] <Tv_> Sam: i'm trying to say use Commons if you want, and then have a "non-profits please contact with proof of your legal status for a more free license"
[17:31:29] <Tv_> non-transferable etc
[17:31:37] <Tv_> then you don't have to enumerate the conditions and worry
[17:32:06] <Sam> Oh yah, sure, I just don't want to have to manually keep track of it, having a license just lets everyone use it and if you find out they're lying then you can sue to enforce (or more likely just message them and tell them they're not in compliance and ask why, probably can't actually afford to sue anyways)
[17:32:16] <Sam> But you're right that you could grant exceptions too
[17:32:21] <Sam> I just prefer default open to default closed

[17:32:48] <Tv_> sure, but then you need to write a contract/license yourself ;)
[17:33:05] <Sam> Right, that's why I haven't done it.
[17:33:07] <Tv_> automation by means of paying a lawyer to program a license, the irony
[17:33:58] <Tv_> i have to say naming Commons Clause with the same initials as Creative Commons was a mistake
[17:34:05] <Tv_> especially sharing one word
[17:34:29] <Sam> They both involve the Commons, so I dunno why CC would get a monopoly on mentioning that :)
[17:34:40] <Tv_> not a monopoly, but a first mover advantage
[17:34:46] <Sam> The initials I guess could be confusing, but I've never heard anyone refer to it as CC so I've never seen them be confused, but I could see how that could happen
[17:35:09] <Sam> That sentence got away from me. That's a lot of "could"'s. It's early, sorry.
[17:35:17] <Tv_> just like you probably shouldn't create a Great Program License now
[17:36:42] <Sam> I dunno, there's nothing that makes you want to use "great program", but if you're about the commons it seems like you want it in the name, so in theory I agree but I think those are different and I'm not sure what else they could have done
[17:37:01] <Sam> "Commons License Clause" or something I guess? Not quite as catchy
[17:39:40] <Tv_> Software Commons ;-)

[22:45:18] <canurabus> hi. I'm having some trouble understanding how to use Context. I want to call a function in some package that takes a Context. From what I read, I can create an empty (Background), WithTimeout or WithCancel context. When I pass this to the function, I can have it return early if I explicitly cancel it or the deadline I specified is met. So if I call the function do I usually assume its a long-running, blocking function?
[22:46:07] <canurabus> If its blocking, how would I call 'cancel' on it?
[22:46:29] <novns> in another thread?
[22:47:42] *** Joins: independent56 (~independe@195-154-105-157.rev.poneytelecom.eu)
[22:47:55] <canurabus> Ok. So functions that take a Context as their first arg by convention are 'synchronous'? And may take a long time to complete
[22:47:58] <bpalmer> indeed; probably some other goroutine needs to handle it, although it could also be handled by a callback in the same
[22:48:44] <bpalmer> canurabus: go does not have 'asynchronous' vs 'synchronous' functions at a language level. (There's somewhere a famous blog post about programming with different function colors; go does not do that)
[22:49:40] <bpalmer> canurabus: a function that takes a context is likely to involve something that needs a context; contexts can carry information including deadline and cancellation details, but can also carry other information
[22:50:31] <Tv_> canurabus: everything in Go looks "synchronous"; nothing in Go *is* synchronous
[22:50:53] <Tv_> canurabus: imagine a world where async was a natural part of the language
[22:51:11] <bpalmer> Good function documentation should typically mention when behavior continues asynchronously (for example, see net/http's ServeTLS)
[22:52:57] <Tv_> "continues" is a funny word there.. ServeTLS spawns goroutines, but it doesn't return until everything is done
