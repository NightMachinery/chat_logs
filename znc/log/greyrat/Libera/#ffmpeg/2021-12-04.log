[00:03:33] <Flat> Trying to encode a vp9 webm with transparency, I'm passing -pix_fmt yuva420p and ffmpeg shows the encoder output as using that format however ffprobe shows yuv420p and the video does not have alpha. Any ideas?
[00:03:55] <Flat> source is rawvideo bgra
[00:04:18] <furq> what are you playing back the video in
[00:04:35] <furq> the lavf vp9 decoder didn't support alpha last i heard, you had to force the libvpx decoder
[00:04:49] <BtbN> Pretty sure the resulting video will in fact be yuv420p, and some special magic entirely separate alpha channel.
[00:05:08] <furq> lavc i mean
[00:06:10] <Flat> playing in MPV, chrome and firefox, all have a black background instead of typical transparency
[00:06:21] <furq> with mpv you need --vd=libvpx-vp9
[00:06:26] <furq> it should work in browsers though
[00:07:16] <BtbN> mpv will not turn its window transparent, if you expect that.
[00:07:42] <furq> it should show a chequerboard pattern

[00:08:24] <Flat> No, but it should show a checkered background, which it does with --vd=libvpx-vp9 so I guess everything is fine and it's just not actually yuva, and the browsers don't make a difference unless it's on a webpage overlaying something else I suppose.. so nothing wrong thanks lol
[00:08:58] <furq> yeah vpx encodes the alpha channel in some weird way
[00:09:12] <JEEB> it's a separate video stream packed nearby, basically
[00:09:21] <Flat> Yeah, I guess whatever version of electron discord uses doesn't support it either.
[00:09:21] <furq> i thought ffprobe mentioned it as side data or something but i don't have one to hand
[00:09:21] <JEEB> so you need a separate decoder instance for it etc
[00:09:32] <BtbN> Seems like VP9 also just doesn't support it? Only VP8?
[00:09:34] <JEEB> I did some initial hacking on it but as soon as you hit multithreading
[00:09:40] <furq> vp9 does support it
[00:09:50] <JEEB> BtbN: I think it's in both, although I think I only poked at VP8
[00:09:52] <furq> i think it wasn't supported in browsers for a long time
[00:09:54] <furq> only vp8
[00:10:02] <furq> maybe that's still true idk
[00:10:18] <JEEB> not sure if both utilize the same matroska packing way
[00:10:19] <Flat> ffprobe only shows one stream, but apparently sets alpha_mode to 1 in the metadata
[00:10:54] *** Joins: teebz8 (~tcb@66.51.154.90)
[00:11:55] <furq> apparently it's supported in firefox and chrome so maybe it's an hwdec issue
[00:12:04] <JEEB> https://github.com/jeeb/ffmpeg/commit/1c8bdb404c67bdd36611afb66bd925fad6588660
[00:12:10] <JEEB> that was my hack, basically
[00:12:17] <JEEB> only worked with a single thread, of course :D
[00:12:37] <JEEB> so with the packets you get AV_PKT_DATA_MATROSKA_BLOCKADDITIONAL
[00:12:47] <JEEB> and that contains a packet for the completely separate alpha video packet

[00:13:36] <JEEB> and yes I would expect for hwdec you'd have to bring up multiple instances
[00:13:41] <JEEB> one for the base layer
[00:13:47] <JEEB> and another separate decoder for alpha
[00:13:53] <JEEB> and then merge the results, naturally
[00:16:14] <furq> Flat: if it's just a short loop with no sound then maybe use webp or apng
[00:20:38] <Flat> furq: yes it is, I'll give that a try, thank you!
[00:21:38] <furq> also if you use webp then test that in a browser because lavc doesn't decode animated webp at all
[00:21:54] <furq> ffmpeg can encode it through libwebp though

[17:51:55] <ea3c> I cannot figure out how to invoke the exposure filter. Do I use -vf?
[17:53:28] <BtbN> Yes.
[17:54:06] <ea3c> That's what I thought, but it doesn't work in the version of ffmpeg that I have.
[17:55:27] <ea3c> I use something like this: ffplay -vf exposure=1.0 22503300.AVI
[17:57:14] <ea3c> I am using this version:ffplay version 3.4.8-0ubuntu0.2
[17:59:45] <BtbN> That's ancient
[18:00:01] <ea3c> As I thought.
[18:00:18] <BtbN> Also, don't use AVI, it's horrible. And if you don't specify what codecs to use, who knows what you end up with.
[18:00:24] <ea3c> What version do I need?

[18:37:13] <SnowCode> Hello. I need help with Whatsapp preview
[18:37:29] <SnowCode> I've recorded my screen with ffmpeg using this command:
[18:37:44] <SnowCode> $ ffmpeg -f x11grab -i :0.0 -preset ultrafast file.mkv
[18:38:01] <SnowCode> Then I've re-encoded it using this command:
[18:38:27] <SnowCode> $ ffmpeg -i file.mkv -vcodec libx265 -crf 28 file1.mp4
[18:39:07] <SnowCode> None of the two files have a preview in whatsapp
[18:39:15] <SnowCode> So my old trick was to run this command:
[18:39:43] <SnowCode> $ ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -movflags faststart file2.mp4
[18:40:24] <SnowCode> But then file2.mp4 is not accepted by whatsapp at all because it's "unsupported"
[18:40:26] <BtbN> Well, iirc WhatsApp supports precisely h264+aac in mp4. And nothing else.
[18:40:42] <BtbN> So your first file is mkv, and fails because of that.
[18:40:48] <BtbN> Second file is HEVC, and fails because of that.
[18:40:58] <BtbN> Third file is whatever mp4 defaults are.
[18:41:12] <BtbN> Also, re-encoding that many times will trash the quality.
[18:41:19] <SnowCode> I've also tried to replace libx265 by libx264 in the second command and it said the file wasn't supported

[18:45:54] <SnowCode> This site seems to be able to convert my file1.mp4 into a whatsapp video: https://webservice.online-convert.com/convert-for-whatsapp
[18:46:03] <SnowCode> But I would like to be able to do it with ffmpeg anyway
[18:46:11] *** Quits: triko (~triko@87.68.195.89) (Quit: Connection closed)
[18:48:20] <BtbN> Like I said, you need mp4, with h264 and aac
[18:51:48] <SnowCode> so something like that would work:
[18:52:11] <SnowCode> $ ffmpeg -i file.mkv -vcodec libx264 -acodec aac -crf 28 file1.mp4
[18:52:19] <SnowCode> ? or do I have to remove crf ?
[18:54:49] <BtbN> you absolutely do want to specify a crf, or some other quality options. The defaults are bad.
[18:54:59] <BtbN> And you'll also want to specify an audio bitrate, no idea what the default is
[18:55:10] <BtbN> and both -acodec and -vcodec are deprecated. Use -c:v and -c:a.

[18:58:38] <SnowCode> BtbN:The thing is that there is no audio to the video
[18:59:03] <BtbN> Just drop any audio options then
[18:59:39] <JEEB> r/56
[18:59:49] <SnowCode> ?
[19:00:44] <SnowCode> BtbN:I've run:
[19:01:07] <SnowCode> $ ffmpeg -i file.mkv -c:v libx264 -crf 28 file1.mp4
[19:01:17] <BtbN> Yeah, looks fine to me.
[19:01:21] <BtbN> But is still a pointless re-encode
[19:01:23] <SnowCode> The file cannot be uploaded to whatsapp because whatsapp say it's unsupported
[19:01:34] <BtbN> I see nothing unsupported there.
[19:01:49] <SnowCode> Me neither. I hope whatsapp will soon die tbh it's such a bad platform
[19:02:08] <SnowCode> Maybe whatsapp upgraded to libx265, because that's supported, but still no preview
[19:02:11] <BtbN> Is it too big maybe? Limit is 16MB according to their docs.
[19:03:03] <SnowCode> Not at all it's a 20 seconds video the original file is 1.4M and the converted file is less than 500k
[19:03:20] <BtbN> paste ffprobe of the file.
[19:03:28] <BtbN> And I still don't understand why you encode twice.
[19:03:34] <BtbN> That pointlessly kills the quality
[19:03:46] <SnowCode> You mean first and second commands? (record and encode)
[19:03:55] <BtbN> The record command very much encodes as well
[19:04:02] <BtbN> Might as well encode to correct format right away
[19:04:19] <SnowCode> yes but my computer isn't powerful enough to encode it like that.
[19:04:28] <SnowCode> That's why I have the ultrafast preset
[19:05:54] <BtbN> Use that for the final video then
[19:06:07] <BtbN> Not like re-encoding it with a slower preset later will make it better. Quite the opposite.
[19:06:24] <SnowCode> Here's the output of the ffprobe command for the re-encoded video: https://x0.at/dUYc.txt

[19:07:16] <BtbN> That seems a bit unneccesary

[23:43:10] <Atsuko> hey all
[23:43:28] <Atsuko> trying to demux pcm audio from a bluray source to wave and ffmpeg gives me this error
[23:43:30] <Atsuko> [wav @ 0000020f7aa13d00] Filesize 8221465542 invalid for wav, output file will be broken
[23:44:01] <Atsuko> what is my filesize limit here, and what are my options?
[23:44:05] *** Quits: betelgeuse9 (~betelgeus@94-225-47-8.access.telenet.be) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:44:06] <JEEB> yup, wav is limited in file size
[23:44:15] <JEEB> w64 is one alternative that some applications support
[23:44:43] <JEEB> the limit is 32bit integer I think
[23:45:02] <JEEB> yea UINT32_MAX
[23:45:18] <furq> Atsuko: -rf64 always
[23:45:20] *** Joins: betelgeuse9 (~betelgeus@94-225-47-8.access.telenet.be)
[23:45:29] <furq> is the most compatible thing if you really need wav
[23:45:50] <furq> you're probably better off just using flac though
[23:45:51] <Atsuko> im only going to wav so i can then encode to flac
[23:45:58] <Atsuko> yeah can i go directly there?
[23:45:59] <furq> just go to flac directly

[23:46:13] <furq> lavc flac with -compression_level 10 is roughly as good as flac -8
