[00:48:38] <lantech19446> like @here or @all aren't gonna do shit because @ has a different meaning in irc the closest i could conceive of would be #reddit-sysadmin and i don't think that works either

[00:50:56] <lantech19446> so wait you're telling me if I do @here in irc and someone is connected via discord which I didn't even know was possible until like 30 seconds ago it'll ping them?
[00:51:29] <Cl0udNinja> pretty sure
[00:51:48] <Cl0udNinja> I know theres `@everyone` that will absolutely ping an entire discord channel

[10:00:18] <JollyRgrs> trying my best to use 3 external monitors along w/ my laptop's own screen... Dell TB16 has DP, mini-DP and HDMI... laptop also has HDMI... I was hoping at least some combiation of the 4 would afford me this elusive third extra monitor
[10:01:32] <SirSceptalot> captain obvious here: does the iGPU support 4 monitors?
[10:01:41] <SirSceptalot> or discrete gpu if it has one

[10:04:44] <JollyRgrs> catbeard: uh... why would I care about ARC?
[10:05:17] <JollyRgrs> SirSceptalot: well, that's the thing... i think the iGpu only supports 3 total... but it also has a quadro m620
[10:05:23] <JollyRgrs> i would hope that could drive 4 total monitors
[10:05:27] <yuken> SirSceptalot, yes, way too early
[10:05:31] <yuken> noon is about when you need to wkae
[10:05:47] <JollyRgrs> that's the road i'm going down to see if that'll work. might need to adjust BIOS or something to force using that as primary
[10:20:55] <Hunterkll> unless it's not wired to the video ports 
[10:21:17] <Hunterkll> you're probably limited to the iGPU's supported display assortments

I got 3 on top, laptop full-open to use as a monitor in center-bottom and i'm getting hardware to VESA mount the TB16... I just need M2.5 screws for the 2 screw holes on the back

[16:27:49] <xe0n> as in...forward a copy of a msg to somewhere else after you send it? transport rule
[16:29:46] <SirSceptalot> that was my first thought too, but teh_f4ll3n said "deposited there from an app" so I assumed the mails would be injected into the folder without actually being sent
[16:30:49] <xe0n> it would be sending mail using smtp...so you'd make a transport rule that can detect the application's mail
[16:30:56] <teh_f4ll3n> I said no such thing
[16:30:59] <xe0n> whether it has a certain subject, or whatever
[16:31:10] <xe0n> it's probably using the user's mailbox to send it out
[16:31:29] <SirSceptalot> oh sorry teh_f4ll3n, I meant DrZak 
[16:31:29] <xe0n> like...an application that sends email is using...smtp..and if its ending in the user's sent items, then its using their mailbox
[16:31:46] <xe0n> or you would just...just add a cc\bcc to the email msg? lol

[17:51:55] <estranger> its pretty but sucks balls at scale, and when things go sideways its hard to stand back up
[17:52:02] <PublicWiFi> it CAN be someone's business if they hired you with the agreement you wouldn't do those subtances
[17:52:09] <PattyCakes> nah, fuck them
[17:52:09] <fritzwastaken> r/antiwork seems to have recovered from that Fox interview well
[17:52:14] <PublicWiFi> signing a contract agreeing to it and then getting pissed you get in trouble for it is retarded
[17:52:23] <fritzwastaken> Who says im getting in trouble for it?
[17:52:31] <PattyCakes> pffft, this is Texas bro
[17:52:34] <PublicWiFi> no I'm just saying its not that simple lol
[17:52:34] <PattyCakes> there are no employment contracts
[17:52:39] <PattyCakes> it really is that simple though
[17:52:40] <PublicWiFi> there are agreements
[17:52:48] <fritzwastaken> My company is based in California they have been legal for like a decade
[17:52:55] <fritzwastaken> theres nothing in my contract about it
[17:52:56] <estranger> my agreement says "try not to be high at work"
[17:53:01] <PattyCakes> hahah estranger
[17:53:06] <PublicWiFi> lmfao that's amazing
[17:53:11] <estranger> california man
[17:53:22] <PattyCakes> really it comes down to this "BE A FUCKING ADULT AT WORK'
[17:53:26] <PublicWiFi> I mean if your employer hired you and said "we don't care what you do so long as you do good work blah blah" then sure 
[17:53:31] <estranger> we used to have #drugs on slack haha but that got shuttdown
[17:53:32] <PattyCakes> if a little weed makes the day better and your job work more productive
[17:53:34] <PattyCakes> go for it
[17:53:41] <PattyCakes> but getting high and falling asleep on the couch
[17:53:43] <PattyCakes> is not acceptable
[17:53:44] <PublicWiFi> yeah lmfao
[17:53:45] <PattyCakes> too often
[17:53:58] <PattyCakes> ngl - hgave absolutely done that
[17:54:06] <PublicWiFi> I've done that once, not fun xD
[17:54:09] <PattyCakes> just don't make it a habit
[17:54:12] <PublicWiFi> couldn't even pour myself a glass of sweet tea
[17:54:21] <PattyCakes> iit all comes back to being an adult
[17:54:23] <PattyCakes> be a reasonable adult
[17:54:25] <PattyCakes> and everyone is happy
[17:54:26] <PublicWiFi> cotton mouth with no sweet tea... redneck's nightmare
[17:54:28] <estranger> customer: "we need your guys to be drug tested to work with our stuff" company: "no"
[17:54:32] <estranger> unless its federal work hehe
[17:54:36] <sintax> lol
[17:54:52] <PattyCakes> I straight up declined a contract at RackSpace because they were gonna test
[17:54:55] <PublicWiFi> I have to agree to being Drug Free‚Ñ¢ cause medical
[17:54:57] <PublicWiFi> rip
[17:54:59] <PattyCakes> I went to my boss and said "I ain't gonna pass that test"
[17:55:08] <PattyCakes> boss was like "Ok, we'll get you another contract"
[17:55:09] <PublicWiFi> even our vendors are subject to drug tests if we wanted cause it can come back on us or some shit
[17:55:18] <PublicWiFi> maybe I made that up
[17:55:19] <estranger> federal background checks kinda require it..... i got out of federal work for that an other reasons 
[17:55:20] <PublicWiFi> xD
[17:55:28] <estranger> the fed makes large enterprises look efficient ... annoys me
[17:55:35] <estranger> but... they have a bottomless wallet
[17:55:43] <PattyCakes> Fed isn;'t my market
[17:55:45] <fritzwastaken> Weed is on the same level as caffeine or nicotine for me
[17:55:47] <PattyCakes> plenty of other work out there for me
[17:55:49] <fritzwastaken> it aint on the same level as booze
[17:55:50] <PublicWiFi> interestingly, I learned that 10mg adderall daily will show up on a pee test BUT not be a dark enough line to actually get in trouble over PattyCakes 
[17:55:51] <sintax> estranger you mean bottomless tax paying people.
[17:55:54] <sintax> got it
[17:56:03] <estranger> oh and when its part of the military and you got some  half cocked general running it... they are often assholes
[17:56:07] <PublicWiFi> i mean I have a legit script so it doesn't matter but I thought that was interesting lol
[17:56:10] <PattyCakes> PublicWiFi that depends ENTIRELY on the test you take
[17:56:13] <estranger> sintax, exactly.... or they just print more money
[17:56:15] <PublicWiFi> yeah prolly true
[17:56:18] <PattyCakes> some tests are more reactive than others
[17:56:21] <PublicWiFi> the simple ones you dip
[17:56:36] <estranger> if you have an aderroll rx you just show your script and should be ok
[17:56:40] <PattyCakes> ^
[17:56:44] <PublicWiFi> we had some chick brag about her coke binge one weekend

[19:06:33] <teh_f4ll3n> I mean mainstream, not extended
[19:06:46] <teh_f4ll3n> I know extended ends next year
[19:07:13] <signofzeta> Office 2013 is still supported.
[19:07:26] <signofzeta> But if you want to use Modern Auth, you need SP1 + some update + another update, and you need to set a registry key.
[19:07:34] <signofzeta> so it can *look* like it's unsupported.
[19:08:50] <signofzeta> (Office 2010, on the other hand, *is completely* unsupported, and Outlook 2010 is now blocked from Exchange Online.  But 2013 still works, with help.)
[19:09:07] <DrZak> '13 is unsupported too
[19:11:04] <signofzeta> nope, extended support runs until April 11, 2023
[19:11:19] <DrZak> yea, for Office 2013
[19:11:25] <DrZak> but, its isnt supported with Office 365
[19:11:26] <signofzeta> you might be thinking of Office 2013 *without SP1*, which went out of support on April 14, 2015.
[19:12:00] <signofzeta> no, I still have ExO users using Outlook 2013 (against my will).  You do need to set the EnableADAL registry key so that it will use Modern Authentication, though.
[19:12:13] <signofzeta> out of the box, Office 2013 only uses Basic Auth, which sucks/doesn't work, depending on your setup.
[19:12:42] <DrZak> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/endofsupport/microsoft-365-services-connectivity
[19:12:49] <DrZak> We won‚Äôt take any active measures to block other versions of the Office client that are still supported and are up to date, such as Office 2013 with Service Pack 1, from connecting to Microsoft 365 services. But these older clients may encounter performance or reliability issues over time.
[19:13:17] <fritzwastaken> There is something magical about those little 2x3 packs of peanut butter and cheddar cracker sammiches

[19:59:44] <vinrock> any time i have to do long runs or go outside i use fiber to elimitate a ground path
[19:59:54] <PublicWiFi> i just visited the /u/ address for one of my reddit accounts and it got a NSFW warning?
[20:00:01] <PublicWiFi> I've never posted anything nsfw lol
[20:00:02] <vinrock> u bigol perv
[20:00:13] <PublicWiFi> wonder if its cause of my politcal subs I visit lol
[20:00:18] <vinrock> probably
[20:00:29] <vinrock> i constantly see posts and profiles that have the nsfw warning for no apparent reason
[20:00:34] <vinrock> i assume its being used for other purposes internally
[20:00:58] <PublicWiFi> I've also noticed some accounts have their comments hidden sometimes and you have to click it to show
[20:01:02] <PublicWiFi> literally 1984
[20:01:05] <PublicWiFi> ;P
[20:01:10] <vinrock> i wiped my reddit history and never used the site again after spez edited a comment
[20:01:12] <vinrock> yep

[20:17:51] <PublicWiFi> the hidden comments?

[20:18:20] <PublicWiFi> I only visit a select few subreddits and I've only ever seen it hide "uncommon" viewpoints lol

[20:19:06] <PublicWiFi> any state or city subreddit is that way
[20:19:19] <vinrock> yeah i discovered this weekend after opening up r/ottawa
[20:19:24] <PublicWiFi> you gotta remember that reddit is a piss poor sample of the general public
[20:19:27] <PublicWiFi> same for twitter
[20:19:33] <vinrock> reddit is right up there with twitter
[20:19:38] <PublicWiFi> yeah for sure

[20:21:58] <vinrock> yeah
[20:22:15] <vinrock> when i started playing eve in 2009, our alliance was made up of different groups from all the big forums
[20:22:21] <PublicWiFi> I've been looking for some old school forums that line up with my pol beliefs but they are all dying or dead lol

[20:22:29] <vinrock> thats the internet i miss
[20:23:02] <vinrock> bdenlinger the new jersey sub is basically wealthy elites in north jersey spewing absolute hate for their neighbors
[20:23:10] <DomLS3> @bdenlinger sure there are. But statisically speaking the crime rates are significantly lower in areas that are not ethnically diverse
[20:23:28] <vinrock> and people posting photos of the breakfast sandwiches
[20:23:33] <DomLS3> and that's not being racist it's just the truth
[20:23:38] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> oboy you sure do love to trigger me

[20:24:05] <PublicWiFi> turns out when you put a few differing cultures all shoved together things tend to get rough over time

[20:24:15] <DomLS3> of course they do
[20:24:31] <PublicWiFi> now there's definitly value to having multiple cultures mixed, BUT for whatever reason (globally) when they are all really close together overtime it gets weird
[20:24:56] <PublicWiFi> differing cultures means differing values and stuff, so it makes sense there would be conflict
[20:25:05] <PublicWiFi> even on a small scale that happens, so imagine it on the scale of half a city
[20:25:19] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> yea know if *those people* would just learn our culture we'd be fine
[20:25:33] <vinrock> thats what each group thinks of the other
[20:25:35] <PublicWiFi> in reality having places like "china town" and whatnot are nice for those cultures
[20:25:49] <PublicWiFi> cause they can be around their like minded folk, but also integrate in the society as a whole as well
[20:26:05] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> vinrock that's how you end up with the Canadian Indian residential schools
[20:26:21] <PublicWiFi> its super neat to read about
[20:26:22] <vinrock> oh i learned a lot recently about how canadians treat natives
[20:26:25] <vinrock> i was kinda shocked
[20:26:31] <DomLS3> The sad part is... the ones who complain the most about racial bigotry are the ones segregating themselves and causing more racial issues. Imagine if there were a TV channel created called White Entertainment Network
[20:26:40] <DomLS3> or someone wearing a T-Shirt that says Proud To Be White
[20:26:45] <PublicWiFi> yeah its all a shit show
[20:26:52] <vinrock> i learned about the thing where the cops would drive native people out to the middle of nowhere in the freezing night with nothing to stay awrm
[20:26:58] <vinrock> theres a name for this practice because it was so common in canada
[20:27:02] <vinrock> i cant remmerb it tho
[20:27:05] <PublicWiFi> I even saw a picture of a college with a POC area only or some shit lol
