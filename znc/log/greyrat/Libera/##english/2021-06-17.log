[07:50:30] <pussipupu> It's probably better to keep them as noun-phrases rather than trying to make each list item into a full sentence

[07:51:29] <hoglahoo> why did you change your mind?
[07:52:15] <Izem> it's like, the name of something

[07:56:24] <LjL> pussipupu, close enough, they both come from the french words that have a clear noun-verb relationship

[13:19:25] <tenochtitlan> I do know that "to steal a kiss" means "to kiss someone in a quick and sudden way" according to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary. But in this scenario, LaBoeuf is an adult man and Mattie Ross is a teenager.

[16:47:05] <tinsoldier> racy — Adjective: 1. Mildly risqué., 2. Having a strong flavor indicating origin; of distinct characteristic taste; tasting of the soil., 3. (figuratively, by extension) Exciting to the mind by a strong or distinctive character of thought or language; peculiar and piquant; fresh and lively., 4. (programming) Involving a data race or a race condition. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/racy
[16:47:18] <kurahaupo> twb: Since nth cousins share a nearest common ancestor n+1 generations back, that makes one's nieces & nephews 0th-cousins once removed, and one's own children are minus-one-th cousins once removed. 😋

[17:02:39] <drbean> I thought brunette was some kind of brownish hair (not-black) hair.
[17:05:10] <kurahaupo> drbean: My understanding too. the world is going mad saying the word "black" can't be used for the absence of light because "racist"
[17:05:47] <masoudd> world?
[17:06:17] <kurahaupo> The world is going mad because some people say…
[17:06:50] <kurahaupo> … and other people accept, and turn instead to contorting the meanings of words like "brunette"
[17:07:00] <NewB> words as words aren't bad, what makes them bad is the way you use them
[17:07:44] <kurahaupo> And we let those99,99 people get away with saying really stupid shite like "brunette includes black hair". Hell no.
[17:08:10] <TimMc> kurahaupo: I don't think I've heard anyone say that, and I run in some fairly "woke" circles. You might have heard someone *parodying* woke culture and saying that, though.
[17:08:11] <NewB> I was told that yesterday and I  believed it 
[17:08:27] <kurahaupo> TimMc: phew.

[17:09:43] <TimMc> e.g. I'm on board with getting rid of the "master/slave" language around databases, and using primary/secondary or even master/replica.
[17:10:14] <TimMc> but some people are hot for getting rid of the term "master branch" in git, which doesn't actually mean master as in master/slave
[17:11:24] <TimMc> I'm also fine with replacing blacklist/whitelist with blocklist (or denylist)/allowlist, because black/white there have "moral" connotations rather than actually being about colors.
[17:11:32] <masoudd> ok slavery is bad, but why do we need to remove the _word_ "slave" from the entire language?
[17:11:52] <masoudd> that word didn't hurt anybody
[17:12:09] <TimMc> masoudd: I think the idea here, in the case of disks and databases, is that it trivializes slavery.
[17:12:24] <masoudd> Does it really though?
[17:13:02] <TimMc> I think it does. Not horribly, but to some degree, yeah.
[17:13:29] <TimMc> There's also a really good point that it's *inaccurate*, and obscures the real technical situation -- primary/secondary are objectively better terms.
[17:14:32] <TimMc> (Same for blacklist/whitelist -- why obscure with metaphor?)
[17:15:47] <TimMc> On slavery, it's easy to forget just how truly horrifying it is, and using the term metaphorically in a casual way probably does not help with that.
[17:16:27] <masoudd> Sure what's next? removing the color black from chess?
[17:16:54] <masoudd> Isn't it kinda racist that the white moves first and black second?
[17:18:28] <TimMc> heh
[17:19:25] <TimMc> I'm sure someone has advocated for that. It's a big world out there.
[17:19:32] <hoglahoo> or bowling where the black ball beats up all the white pins
[17:19:49] <masoudd> Nevermind the origin of chess where it was invented long before european ships even reached the american continent
[17:20:10] <TimMc> OK, so here's my own concern with all this: I think that placing all of these things in a racial light actually makes things worse, via stereotype threat.

[17:20:49] <TimMc> For example, now every time I hear "master branch" in the context of git, I think of "master/slave". That connection wasn't in my mind before, and now it's impossible to remove.
[17:21:06] <TimMc> I'm white. But what if I were black? Wouldn't this actually make my life worse?
[17:21:25] <masoudd> I don't know the ethymology of blacklist/whitelist. But just assuming racist motivations for it is somewhat childish. Even in Persian we have equivalent words for them that have "black" and "white"

[17:21:50] <TimMc> (Stereotype threat is a phenomenon whereby people who are stereotyped as less intelligent actually do worse on e.g. standardized tests if there are cues reminding them of those stereotypes.)
[17:22:39] <TimMc> "Master/slave" is pretty blatant -- you can make the association with no outside help. But *adding* connotations where they didn't exist before? Probably harmful.
[17:23:00] <TimMc> masoudd: The trouble here is that it's only partly about etymology.
[17:23:03] <masoudd> And there is the hilarious case of white people insisting on calling indians "native americans" even though they want to be called indians
[17:23:09] <TimMc> Well, that varies.
[17:23:18] <TimMc> Not even by nation, but by individual.
[17:23:32] <twb> masoudd: if you're talking about chess, shatranj came from chaturanga
[17:23:51] <TimMc> and it's also really irritating to have two dimetrically separate groups of people called Indians. :-P
[17:24:03] <twb> I'm not sure if the pieces were ivory and ebony back then, or jade, or what
[17:24:19] <TimMc> (I used to hear "dot or feather?" but not recently, heh.)
[17:24:30] <hoglahoo> they were blond and brunette <twb> I'm not sure if the pieces were ivory and ebony back then, or jade, or what
[17:24:40] <twb> "The colours are not those of the two camps, but mean that the frogs have two colours, yellow and green."
[17:25:07] <masoudd> I doubt people in india who came up with ideas about chaturanga really meant to signify the differences of people's skin color in the future in a distant continent
[17:25:37] <twb> hoglahoo: an awful lot of whitefallas get bhindi and bindhi confused, too
[17:26:49] <TimMc> masoudd: Again, it's not just about etymology.
[17:28:12] <masoudd> What part of a Master/Slave database hierarchy is offensive?
[17:28:43] <TimMc> I don't think it's useful to use the word "offensive", by the way. I think that obscures things.
[17:28:54] <masoudd> Problematic?
[17:29:39] <twb> I think it's popular in America because they prefer to rename unequal groups instead of fixing the actual inequality
[17:29:39] <TimMc> That might be more accurate, yeah.
[17:29:45] <TimMc> heh
[17:29:57] <TimMc> Yes, I've joked about how all hierarchical terms should be banned. :-P
[17:30:16] <twb> Having said that, if it's easy to relabel stuff, just do it instead of bitching about it
[17:30:35] <huf> is the master/slave thing something requested mostly by black people because it's problematic
[17:30:36] <TimMc> twb: That's definitely one of those haha-only-serious observations.
[17:30:39] <huf> or mostly by woke white people?
[17:30:46] <huf> I think that's the first thing we have to figure out
[17:31:00] <TimMc> ^
[17:31:09] <huf> because if the first, let's drop the terminology
[17:31:21] <TimMc> I mean, I mostly only know woke white people, so it's hard to tell. -.-
[17:31:28] <huf> if the second, then ... it's probably just idiots trying to appear to do something about racism without fixing racism
[17:31:31] <huf> TimMc: yeah
[17:31:41] <TimMc> But... if you only know one black person, they're not even necessarily representative.

[17:33:03] <twb> (Which is not a new observation; Gil Scott-Heron was pointing it out 50 years ago)
[17:33:15] <masoudd> I wonder if at all it's a good idea to change your language because a group of people say they don't like it?
[17:33:28] <TimMc> I think it can be.
[17:33:35] <huf> masoudd: being polite?
[17:33:39] <huf> yes, it's a good idea in general
[17:33:45] <huf> being kind to people is also a good idea
[17:33:52] <masoudd> That's a very slippery slope if you ask me
[17:33:53] <TimMc> Depends on the situation.
[17:33:56] <twb> masoudd: I think it is polite to refer to a group with the terms they prefer
[17:34:00] <huf> and changing your language a bit is not a huge hassle
[17:34:07] <TimMc> huf: It's harder with software. -.-
[17:34:11] <twb> masoudd: in law, we have a thing called a "reasonable person test"
[17:34:23] <twb> masoudd: it's how you deal with "slippery slope" concerns
[17:34:49] <twb> You say "OK a reasonable person would say case A is clearly fine, and case C is clearly bullshit, and case B is kinda debatable"
[17:34:51] <TimMc> Also note that the "git master" thing didn't go as far as the master/slave database thing, in terms of people making actual changes.
[17:34:58] <masoudd> So what if a group of muslims decide the word "pork" is offensive to them?
[17:35:12] <twb> masoudd: there's an existing case similar to that
[17:35:14] <TimMc> Listen to their concerns, evaluate them, make a decision.
[17:35:26] <TimMc> There's no hard and fast rule.
[17:35:31] <twb> masoudd: in orthodox Judaism it is rude to use God's real name.
[17:35:32] <TimMc> Ignore people who say there is.
[17:35:51] <twb> masoudd: so you could go around waving a sign with "Yahweh" written on it, and it would be really rude
[17:36:05] <twb> masoudd: but in practice they would probably just ignore you
[17:36:05] <masoudd> That's hilarious
[17:36:26] <twb> gentiles gonna gentile, y'know
[17:37:11] <twb> masoudd: OTOH if you wrote "definitely not pork" on a beef and pork ragout, that would probably violate food labelling or honesty in advertising laws
[17:37:54] <twb> Which caught me recently when I bought a lasagne that said "NEW IMPROVED RECIPE" on it, instead of "NOW HARAM"
[17:38:08] <TimMc> oh no
[17:38:19] <onmra> You should weigh the benefits and the negatives. If changing a word makes some people happier  but does no harm to anyone, why not change it?
[17:38:28] <TimMc> And now you know what "improved" means.
[17:38:31] <twb> onmra: right.
[17:38:43] <twb> TimMc: pigs are cheaper
[17:38:55] <masoudd> onmra, So change your name to onmra2 because it makes me happier and does not harm anyone
[17:39:23] <onmra> It would make me unhappy to change it.
[17:39:25] <twb> TimMc: beef is about 20 times more expensive than pig, 50 times more expensive than chicken, and 100 times more expensive than mealworm or cricket.  For the same amount of edible end product.
[17:39:41] <masoudd> onmra, But does it harm you?
[17:39:49] <onmra> Yes, by making me unhappy.
[17:39:57] <twb> masoudd: yes, in terms of reputation management and logistic costs
[17:40:13] <TimMc> masoudd: Also, you're probably just one crank.
[17:40:17] <masoudd> Then I hereby do declare any changes to any words in the English language makes me unhappy.
[17:40:24] <masoudd> Done
[17:40:29] <TimMc> Can't make everyone happy.
[17:40:50] <TimMc> (in the name change situation)
[17:40:53] <twb> masoudd: the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
[17:41:03] <onmra> Like I said you can weigh the postiives and the negatives.
[17:41:21] <masoudd> I don't care either way. This just seems so irrational to me I find it amusing
[17:41:25] <twb> however if you want to stop changes to the english language there is an established method
[17:41:32] <twb> it's called "publish a bible"
[17:41:42] <onmra> What's your argument against changing language though?
[17:42:18] <masoudd> Changing language of the basis of feelings of a minority is a bad idea
[17:42:26] <masoudd> on the basis*
[17:42:28] <onmra> Why?
[17:42:59] <masoudd> There will be no end to groups of offended people with various good or bad motivations
[17:44:00] <onmra> But what's the harm in it?
[17:44:03] <twb> So far, the main downside seems to be you wasted an hour complaining about it
[17:44:23] <twb> When you could've been pressing a nice shiraz
[17:44:29] <TimMc> haha
[17:44:46] <hoglahoo> could have been mastering the evolution of language
[17:44:50] <masoudd> Meaning of words can change. If a word was truley considered rude, then people would stop using it on their own. Don't need a group of rabid woke people canceling whoever dared to use it
[17:45:07] <TimMc> masoudd: Well, now you're talking about something different.
[17:45:25] <onmra> I've literally had someone tell me they didn't feel like adding an extra syllable to  their speech sometimes even if it saves people from dying... It's a very ridiculous stance to take  imo.
[17:45:41] <twb> onmra: "aluminium" ?
[17:46:12] <TimMc> "If a word was truley considered rude"
[17:46:18] <onmra> If that was true, why are people still using the n word?
[17:46:22] <TimMc> well, that's what we're considering right now, it's it?
[17:46:30] <TimMc> No one's rabid here.
[17:46:33] <TimMc> I've had all my shots
[17:46:45] <hoglahoo> sometimes we want to be rude, and we need words for those situations
[17:46:57] <twb> onmra: because hate speech laws in some countries are shit?
[17:47:11] <masoudd> onmra, How can a word be offensive when the people it's supposed to be offending use it themselves?
[17:47:18] <twb> onmra: because sometimes speech is *meant* to offend?
[17:47:32] <masoudd> That makes no sense
[17:47:41] <onmra> Because nuance exists, a word can be offensive in one context and inoffensive in another.
[17:47:43] <twb> masoudd: endonym vs. exonym
[17:48:19] <twb> Or to take a completely different example, in Australia it is offensive to use the name of a recently dead person
[17:48:47] <twb> So if their name was "red" you couldn't say "forehead", you would have to say "top of head" or something
[17:50:54] <TimMc> I *have* considered trying to "kill" a word by giving it a false (or merely misleading) etymology and seeing if I can get people to stop using it.
[17:50:59] <twb> Likewise, some words cannot be said in front of certain people.  Some words are secret and can only heard by men, or only by women.
[17:51:29] <twb> Some words cannot be spoken in front of your mother in law
[17:51:56] <twb> So like you might have to say "bird" in stead of "kookaburra"
[17:52:02] <masoudd> pish posh. I'll say to her whatever I want!
[17:52:24] <TimMc> masoudd: Would you, if it was in the context of people you actually cared about?
[17:52:28] <twb> masoudd: well, that would be like shitting in her mouth, or walking around with no clothes on
[17:52:28] <TimMc> not just internet randoms
[17:52:57] <twb> Customs don't have to make sense
[17:52:59] <TimMc> Imagine a friend came to you and said "hey, this one term really upsets me because <gives explanation>", would you just ignore them?
[17:53:02] <masoudd> I don't have a mother in law :). What is that about kooaburra? why is that offensive?
[17:53:24] <twb> masoudd: that was just an example word.  A kookaburra is a kind of fish-eating bird.
[17:53:52] <twb> The mother-in-law words are different for each language, and I don't know any examples
[17:54:05] <twb> In my part of the country, they do not have that custom
[17:54:45] <masoudd> Ah OK. I see what you mean. There are cultural norms. And I do agree, it's best we follow most of those or else it would be rude
[17:55:57] <masoudd> But cultural norms don't get made by a vocal minority with alteriour motives. Or, they shouldn't be
[17:56:13] <twb> well, in practice they do
[17:56:46] <twb> Like when the ruling mughal minority said "everybody must speak farsi now"
[17:56:57] <twb> and then the ruling british minority said "everybody must speak english now"
[17:57:24] <masoudd> People listened to those because there was an army behind it
[17:57:49] <masoudd> Sure, if you hold a gun to my head I'd say whatever you want
[17:57:52] <twb> So your complaint isn't that a minority wants a change, but a *weak* minority wants a change
[17:58:27] <masoudd> No I didn't mean if you had an army it would be ok then
[17:58:35] <hoglahoo> calling these dangling appendages by my sides 'arms' trivializes the word 'army' and all the awful things armies have done
[17:59:17] <masoudd> Now they have to be called "twin upperbody appendages"
[17:59:36] <onmra> You still haven't explained what's bad about reforming language.
[18:00:30] <onmra> Alluding to some "minority" just seems like being reactionary for the sake of being reactionary.
[18:01:31] <masoudd> I don't have any problem with language being reformed through culture and time. My problem is with the fact that a group of people want to twist everybody's arm to do what they say.
[18:03:22] <onmra> Yes, well, if you can't explain the reasoning behind it then I guess this conversation isn't going to go anywhere. :P
[18:04:02] <masoudd> That's ok. Sorry if I offended anyone. Maybe I need to think more about this
[18:04:25] <masoudd> And mostly just wanted to practice my English. Thank you

[18:08:19] <twb> Oh I have another example
[18:08:44] <twb> in a mental health forum, it's considered offensive to use words like "Oracle" and "Red Hat"
[18:09:00] <twb> even though those same people use those words all day at work
[18:12:07] <masoudd> why is "red hat" offensive to them? What's the different meaning there?

[21:03:50] <thojanssens_> why ##english channel and not #english?
[21:04:16] <zoidberg> Single # is reserved for official foss community
[21:06:36] <zoidberg> Since this is run by old freenode admins, the rules apply here.
[21:06:42] <pussipupu> single hash channels are the on topic channels of peer directed projects with the same name
[21:07:02] <zoidberg> It was a mess in old freenode where some old channels didn’t comply with rules.
[21:07:18] <zoidberg> Ah yeah, that too.
[21:10:14] <pussipupu> slightly broader than what you said but broadly the same
[21:10:45] <blkshp> Community channels can have a # too sometimes
[21:11:21] <blkshp> The definition of which is somewhat open to interpretation and staff discussion. The criteria for this, i am unaware
[21:15:14] <thojanssens_> so what is the #english channel for then?
[21:15:21] <thojanssens_> there're ppl in there
[21:15:50] <blkshp> IT was just registered
[21:16:15] <blkshp> If i could get hold of the channel i'd forward it here.
[21:18:12] <LjL> i don't think #english should be a valid community channel
[21:18:22] <LjL> but indeed the definition is somewhat whatever
[21:20:39] <zoidberg> Maybe if the queen is on irc then..
[21:20:44] <blkshp> LjL: why don't you. To be honest i haven't even a guess at what the criteria is! glguy's not sure but the community registrations are paused for now so maybe in the future and we'll see what happens.
[21:21:06] <zoidberg> I don’t mean Freddie Mercury, the other queen.
[21:21:25] <blkshp> The Queen with a capital Q.
[21:21:28] <zoidberg> Joking

[21:23:35] <thojanssens_> well I saw some ppl asking questions in #english so that's fail
[21:25:09] <LjL> blkshp, because things defined as "on topic" by the policies involve FOSS and peer-directed projects. so to me that means #linux can exist even though it's not linux's official channel, and #programming could very well be directly relevant to FOSS. #english much less so. and also, is something in #english is okay, then why do ## channels still exist for? (which they do, explicitly, although i still maintain that the chanreg page somewhat contradict the policies 
[21:25:09] <LjL> page on the matter of whether any ## channel is actually okay)
[21:25:32] <blkshp> #windows ?
[21:26:01] <LjL> blkshp, that was cited as something that had a big historical community blah blah or whatever
[21:26:10] <blkshp> YEah, i do get what you mean
[21:26:13] <LjL> honestly i think the new distinctions are worse than the old distinctions
[21:26:20] <LjL> i also think that it was the worst possible time to change things
[21:26:29] <LjL> since people were already stressed enough with securing their channels and accounts
[21:26:35] <LjL> but i was told that it was either now, or never
[21:26:47] <blkshp> Definitely.
[21:26:54] <LjL> i'd have preferred never but i'm barely allowed to have my ## channels so
[21:29:43] <zoidberg> I hate that fuss about maintaining channels, those commands and drama.
[21:30:47] <hoglahoo> typing commands is really stressful, yes

[21:38:29] <huf> RP isnt _the_ standard pronunciation either
[21:39:02] <blkshp> Certainly not.
[21:39:41] <zoidberg> I always thought RP is like standard, the proper way, international..
[21:39:49] <huf> .hu has a standards body but I really dont know how much actual influence they have
[21:40:10] <blkshp> Maybe once, not anymore.
[21:40:21] <zoidberg> Many languages have have bodies that maintain them.
[21:40:21] <huf> they set the spelling but it's fiddling at most, I dont think the spelling has changed much since the 18hundreds
[21:40:50] <zoidberg> You mean in Hungarian?
[21:40:59] <huf> and most people dont really care about the nooks of the spelling anyway

[22:37:41] <blkshp> That is the first in the collection I just purchased.
[22:38:20] <zoidberg> Ah yes, Stephen Fry is a fan of PGW. We usually call Wodehouse master.
[22:38:57] <zoidberg> Fry has a written letter from the master himself btw. That lucky lucky guy!
