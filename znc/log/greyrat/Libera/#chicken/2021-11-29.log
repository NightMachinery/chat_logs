[15:44:15] <wxallowed> Did anyone used chicken-scheme as FastCGI client?
[15:44:52] <wasamasa> someone definitely did with C4
[15:45:24] <wasamasa> https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/spiffy-cgi-handlers
[15:45:46] <wasamasa> but no documentation for the fcgi bits

[15:48:38] <wxallowed> spiffy-cgi-handlers: ``Support for the FastCGI server-side specification.  This allows you to run FastCGI client processes like Rails or PHP as backends to be accessed from Spiffy.''
[15:51:03] <wxallowed> fastcgi: yes, I've seen that, but it's bare, I hoped spiffy implemented it already as another option. This means I have to reimplement spiffy's functionalities with intraweb and fastcgi.
[15:51:41] <wxallowed> Intarweb*
[15:52:00] <wasamasa> yup
[15:52:11] <wasamasa> it's a mystery to me why anyone would willingly use fcgi these days
[15:52:35] <wasamasa> when it's a lot easier to just write a normal application and hide it behind nginx
[15:53:01] <wasamasa> or expose it directly to the internet
[15:53:50] <wasamasa> what about call-with-query?
[15:56:18] <wasamasa> wow, loads of dependencies
[15:58:51] <wxallowed> Does it even exists in C5?
[15:59:52] <wxallowed> wasamasa: I have httpd.
[16:00:00] <wasamasa> no, it doesn't
[16:02:03] <wasamasa> going by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4003714/nginx-and-perl-fastcgi-vs-reverse-proxy-psgi-starman there is no clear advantage

[19:11:35] <vandusen> [eggs] Error fetching CHICKEN 4 .release-info file for the following eggs: dbi
[19:21:43] <sandra> I read about htmx the other day. But. My dream is for a web that (when you have JavaScript turned off) works like the old web. For all your scraping and wget and edbrowse purposes
[19:22:15] <sandra> All of the AJAX shenanigans should only be gravy, to make things look smoother and faster, it shouldn't be necessary
[19:23:19] <amazigh> bring back telnet!
[19:23:21] <amazigh> ;)
[19:23:26] <amazigh> mdhughes can help.
[19:23:40] <sandra> I used JavaScript on https://idiomdrottning.org/along_for_the_ride (tap the screen or press space to scroll synced up to the comic panels) but the same image gallery works with JavaScript turned off too
[19:24:42] <sandra> And for people who can't load the images, they get a prose version of the same story
[19:27:16] <sandra> Re the fly.io post. I do maintain a Phoenix/Elixir site and it kinda sucks in this regard (that is, the "working without JavaScript", a.k.a. "Degrading Gracefully" regard).
[19:31:08] <mdhughes> Bring back HTML imagemap
[19:31:18] <mdhughes> Or, as previously noted, Gopher
[19:32:48] <sandra> Imagemaps were awful for the whole scrapey, parsey, mashupy way of interacting with the internet that I love so much. Gopher is fine. There's a SSL-enabled Gopher-like thing called Gemini
[19:33:55] <sandra> Htmx does looks very fun to combine with SXML
[19:37:38] <sandra> OK, HTMX doesn't look so bad now, I'm sorry for dismissing it. (As long as you take care and also make sure the site just works without it, too.)
[19:40:14] <mdhughes> Client-side imagemaps are fine, it's server-side that you can't parse.
[19:40:29] <mdhughes> Lynx even just shows the list of links for client-side.
[19:43:34] <sandra> Back in the day sometimes you didn't get the links. Also, in the browsers at the time an image map sitie was always a pain because the whole "search for a word in the link to go to the page" workflow broke. Searching for text generally didn't work.
[19:43:34] <sandra> Also I couldn't really see what's going on in them because they were low rez and blurry. The problem more generally was rendering text as graphics (to get control over fonts and stuff). A literal map where you can click on a city to read about that city is fine (if you have the list of links under the way Lynx does now).
[19:44:32] <sandra> Image map support was added to Lynx in 2005.
[19:45:44] <sandra> A couple of years after they were the scourge of the internet. By 2005 it was instead the time of the "broken puzzle pieces" (SWF and jar).
[19:45:50] <sandra> Uh I don't wanna do this lecture any more

[20:08:28] <florz> ... and javascript, so that people can then invent HTML forms on top of imagemaps!
[20:16:08] <sandra> HTMX is way more awesome than Hotwire, I belatedly & embarrassingly am realizing, but... I wanna change something in HTMX. In this example: https://htmx.org/examples/tabs-hateoas/ if the attributes were real hrefs, the page would work (just slower and with more flickering) with JS turned off, too. That'd be awesome♥
