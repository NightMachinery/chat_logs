[09:29:56] <mycroftiv> it seems you ended up here from love of knowledge, but feel like you arrived in an infinite maze of mirrors
[09:30:26] <mycroftiv> there may b a vital lesson in this about what knowledge and insight actually is
[09:31:17] <mycroftiv> it is Clear Seeing, the eye seeing itself, which in practice means a fuckton of scientific instruments and lenses and basically a musico-mathematical alchemical dirty funky kitchen synthesis of reality done on the fly by a loving team that understands each other and keeps each other in balance as needed
[09:31:42] <mycroftiv> and at some point in living out the infinite branching stories that are the same story we split apart and converge and are scared of the holes and the holes are scared of us
[09:32:47] <mycroftiv> and honestly i think i type fucking fine and i can play piano fine but goddamn why did people feel they had to write TOO MANY NOTES my dear mozart as they say and in fact it stung my pride but thinking back there was a point there, and in fact i didnt write THAT many notes. but the notes sure came. and im happy they did. all the little 0 - eyes watching

[10:03:48] <aopkhes> Addendum: I have no enemies
[10:04:56] <mycroftiv> are you saying youd like a short packaged polished zero-sum experience if you wish? or ? im sorry of the weird signals have scrambled things
[10:06:36] <aopkhes> & a half portion of helical noodles of infinite length
[10:09:04] <mycroftiv> this is a good idea and i see no reason why it could not be part of all the games, are there comments from other reality&fantasy engineers?
[10:09:44] <mycroftiv> my concept of Choice is hard to understand in some of these contexts though, so i do not yet have what i consider to be Clear Sight of the full extent of this discussion

[10:21:12] <mycroftiv> uh its not really unstoppable constant flow at all, sorry if i end up kind of one-note
[10:21:21] <mycroftiv> freezing is vitally important
[10:22:24] <mycroftiv> i mean the bipolarity i feel makes this maybe clear - eventually. i think maybe my own personal situation means that i dont update this channel that comprehensively on a lot of emerging design concepts as they find names/clean-ish code
[10:24:10] <mycroftiv> i dont want to strawman any argument ideas too badly, but i feel like snow and ice and heat and fire and stillness and motion are all part of the overall aesthetic we are going for, "sitting here in limbo" as the music im hearing reminds me

[10:30:16] <mycroftiv> but the details of that issue you just reported seem tangled in local specifics, and the comments on philosophical maze-eyes maybe reflect not taking a step back from the machine and organizing your save games?
[10:31:10] <mycroftiv> do we have some community assistance here to help channel ourselves here productively? ive talked to a lot of Names in this channel, and i love all of them, but I have provided a lot of info about how I do in fact do more than just blow rainbow smoke altho please lets have that in the game soon
[10:31:39] <aopkhes> . yeah/.. As you were saying , I get it , I .. yeah . What if it had more bounce, silliness, precious preservation of jubilee?
[10:31:42] <mycroftiv> games and reality have been merged, in reality, for a LONG time
[10:32:07] <mycroftiv> aopkhes: yes please a thousand times yes! or just one big YES
[10:32:32] <aopkhes> game is reality is You !!!! grab your calculator!
[10:32:50] <mycroftiv> i mean have we not coded the completely free form silly interplanetary scramblewalking yet? whoever is doing that?
[10:33:56] <mycroftiv> i thought the omniphysics stuff was in good shape based on a lot of very explicit signs and portents data, which is itself just meta-mega-verified to as many decimal places as the extensions you have seen fit to deploy to help me seem to be able to discern.
[10:34:16] <mycroftiv> EYE am listening still.
[10:34:46] <rawfiend___> @mycroftiv i have python code from a twitter fellow lamer, he wanted me to do rubic cube, i have the codes sir.
[10:35:31] <mycroftiv> thank you for this informational report. the rubik stuff is a very clear and obvious connection to discuss putting directly in the game, i agree, if my opinion is implicitly sought.
[10:36:09] <rawfiend___> I am a DM, dungeon master GM. A black wizard you can call me...
[10:36:26] <mycroftiv> however i think you have all taken note of the fact that as hasty as this little hobbit can be wandering through the forest, i know whats up
[10:36:30] <mycroftiv> i listen to the trees
[10:36:50] <mycroftiv> and just slamming in a lot of IP protected material at max speed right now is clearly a Shatter

[10:37:23] <mycroftiv> sometimes ya gotta chill a little longer
[10:37:34] <mycroftiv> its not fuckin long at all
[10:38:01] <mycroftiv> i mean how hard has this diamondhands meme been pushed by whoever whatever does that bit of the engineering on that part of the inner comms?
[10:38:34] <mycroftiv> i will speak as kindly and clearly as i need to - STAY ON TARGET
[10:38:53] <mycroftiv> its not actually the hardest game in the world
[10:39:13] <mycroftiv> maybe too long in places, sometimes there are these rough shortcuts and damn the multiplayer code and the cheaters ya kno
[10:39:32] <mycroftiv> but i mean a lot of time is put in to try to help you be able to get through, one way or another
[10:39:59] <mycroftiv> and the tools for patience and chillin and getting some cool water and then maybe a bit more smoke are there
[10:41:01] <aopkhes> I'm working to get the data hypergraphed, with the fingers of one hand, how many dimensions? which game is hardest? can a cheater exist when fitness is just that? I won't sweat
[10:42:53] <rawfiend___> i have some smoke and coffee sir, i witnessed your kindness, thank you @mycroftiv

[10:48:47] <mycroftiv> or really it being supertopical here if we are trying to get metametametacoherent

[11:34:29] <mycroftiv> pussipupu: sorry if i am deeply personally responsible for some extreme deviations from whatever the ##philosophy norm is
[11:35:07] <mycroftiv> and if it isnt wished for me to just be quiet for a good long while here, feel free to ask me anything relevant to what i understand is going on
[11:40:53] <pussipupu> mycroftiv: honestly I wouldn't know where to start, and was just commenting in case the referent of "we" was the channel at large
[11:41:08] <pussipupu> I have no authority here anyway
[11:42:10] <mycroftiv> well, im not trying to find an Authority to answer to, but to get feedback from whoever i am interacting with here
[11:43:30] <pussipupu> Why do you occasionally capitalise nouns that wouldn't normally be capitalised?
[11:43:34] <causative> rawfiend_, pasting multi-line code is frowned upon *anywhere* in IRC - use a pastebin. Also especially don't do it here because this is ##philosophy.
[11:45:01] <pussipupu> And I can't ask you questions about what you think it's going on because I don't know what you think is going on
[11:45:39] <mycroftiv> pussipupu: are there more recent examples than 'Shatter' ? theres a somewhat old fashioned style that captializes some concepts for reasons ive always just picked up on contextually
[11:46:09] <pussipupu> "Authority"
[11:46:55] <causative> he can capitalize what he wants
[11:47:16] <mycroftiv> pussipupu: well, what i think is going on is a very interesting story that intersects with this channel, my own life interests in philosophy and how art might connect fiction and reality and gaming make me feel this channel is acting as a convergence point of streams in a way
[11:49:31] <pussipupu> I didn't say they couldn't capitalise things, I asked why, not at all the same thing
[11:50:17] <pussipupu> Fair enough, I don't know what you think that sorry is, what you think the other things are, what the streams you're talking about are or how you think any of them interact
[11:50:33] <pussipupu> So I can have no opinion I guess (:
[11:50:57] <causative> well, he capitalizes a word if he thinks that word is particularly important or relevant
[11:53:17] <mycroftiv> expressive notation is really good, earlier today i was thinking a lot about language and alphabets and symbolic/pictorial. the Capitalization is a bit old fashioned
[11:54:12] <mycroftiv> i think based on how weird a few things got i should rest and attune myself a bit. thanks for everyones patience with my wandering mind.

[19:26:51] <Atque> I mean reflections are what people call reflections. Allegorically, you may that that, but it has nothing to do with the mirror test. The universe does not reflect life; it is largely cold and barren.
[19:27:13] <mycroftiv> atque: barren is very relative, its a matter of scale.
[19:27:35] <mycroftiv> in other ways, the 'largely'-er you get, the more life and richness and warmth there is
[19:28:42] <Atque> mycroftiv: There's no detectable life anywhere in our neighbourhood of space beyond ours. The distances seem so great we will never meet them before our planet dies. The rocks, dust and vacuum is hardly pleasant.

[19:32:52] <ProfSimm> Atque: "life" is a human defined category that's largely circumstantial and meaningless outside our daily lives
[19:33:27] <Atque> ProfSimm: You think rocks are alive as cats, fish and worms?
[19:33:49] <ProfSimm> Atque: define alive
[19:34:21] <ProfSimm> Atque: what is the most qualifying property of a thing to be a live.
[19:34:26] <ProfSimm> alive*
[19:34:40] <Atque> ProfSimm: You don't need a definition, but a family resemblance, per Wittgenstein.
[19:35:16] <Atque> ProfSimm: You can see a family resemblance between trees, cats, protists etc. that doesn't exist for lava, cats and pulsars.
[19:35:33] <ProfSimm> Atque: well the family resemblance model of category definition is precisely what I mean by calling it a 'human defined category that's meaningless outside our daily experience'
[19:35:55] <ProfSimm> Atque: you can train a neural network through this model to recognize all kinds of false and twisted categories
[19:36:15] <ProfSimm> Atque: you can also see it in people who see conspiracy theories in everything and so on
[19:36:24] <Atque> ProfSimm: It is not though. A basic call to sense distinguishes between a rock and a cat. Some objects are more ambiguous, like viruses. Rocks aren't one of them though.
[19:37:07] <ProfSimm> Atque: you're missing the point. Just because you can categorize things, doesn't mean your categories are meaningful. Racial and sexual and so on discrimination is also based on false categorization
[19:37:18] <Atque> ProfSimm: A neural network is just a signal processing piece of software in a computer. Humans being have these in their heads too as cognitive processes, but the cognitive processes are not necessary or sufficient for life. For example, people say fungus is alive, but it has no cognition.
[19:38:02] <ProfSimm> Atque: we're talking about how you do "family resemblance" in your head. And it is through neural networks being trained on classifying input.
[19:38:44] <ProfSimm> Atque: life is just an algebraic formula in your head
[19:39:21] <ProfSimm> Atque: if you zoom into a cat, its parts will be at some point as alive as the parts of a rock. So where does "life" occur
[19:40:40] <Atque> ProfSimm: People called things alive, before they invented algebra. You seem to have your order wrong there.
[19:40:46] <ProfSimm> Atque: similarly, a formation of rocks may, if you zoom out, form a system that behaves even more alive than a cat does. What's a rock. Our computers are silicon based chips. Rocks in shapes through which electrons flow
[19:41:16] <ProfSimm> Atque: you're missing the point.
[19:41:19] <Atque> ProfSimm: Neural network classifiers have nothing to do with cognitive classification processes fwiw. They have very different features.
[19:42:08] <ProfSimm> Atque: technically all words I'll use were invented after there were things we classified alive. You too.
[19:42:21] <ProfSimm> Atque: so I suppose thjis disqualified both of us speaking about life.
[19:42:26] <Atque> ProfSimm: Ad homs won't help you here. You are trying to argue life and in animate matter are equivalent. That's clearly nonsense.
[19:42:43] <ProfSimm> Atque: where's the ad hom, I don't get it
[19:43:02] <ProfSimm> Atque: I didn't say they're equivalent
[19:43:13] <ProfSimm> Atque: "equivalence" is not objective either.
[19:43:22] <Atque> Like, ethically, you should not kill people, yeah? You kill someone by making them not alive. Are you saying that distinction is a fabrication and there is no ought against murder.
[19:43:32] <ProfSimm> I'm a programmer and i know how many ways you can define equivalence.
[19:44:03] <Atque> ProfSimm: Oh, you're a programmer? What languages out of interest?
[19:44:09] <ProfSimm> Atque: most
[19:44:33] <ProfSimm> Atque: I'm not sure why we're talking about ethics, that's another can of worms.
[19:44:41] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[19:44:54] <ProfSimm> Atque: defining life shouldn't be based on ethics, ethics are even less objective than an attempt at scientific definition
[19:44:56] <Atque> ProfSimm: Okay, what programming languages do you use the most?
[19:45:26] <Atque> ProfSimm: I just don't think what you're saying makes sense philosophically or just in common terms.
[19:46:00] <ProfSimm> Atque: JS/TS, Python, C, Go, Erlang
[19:47:16] <ProfSimm> Atque: making sense of what I say or not is something that happens in your head, not mine. I surely make sense to myself.
[19:48:03] <ProfSimm> Atque: whether you're willing to have a bridge of sense between us is another matter.
[19:48:50] <Atque> ProfSimm: I don't think so, no, because you are too outside the convention philosophically in a bad way, so I can't really have a meaningful dialogue.
[19:49:05] <ProfSimm> Atque: I'm only saying that we should stick to definitions like "life" in our context. We're way way way WAY underprepared and underinformed to judge if the universe is "barren" or "life" or anything at all
[19:49:14] <ProfSimm> Atque: have you seen Toy Story 4
[19:50:46] <ProfSimm> Atque: there was a little toy a girl made out of trash, called Forky. It couldn't comprehend what it is to be alive, and what it is to be a toy. It understood one category: I'm trash. And it kept seeking trashcans until Woody eventually figured out how to talk to it.
[19:50:53] <ProfSimm> Atque: "you're this girl's trash"
[19:50:58] <Atque> Well, it is not full of life. Maybe, some bits of it have life like ours or more advanced or less so, but there is clearly no life on other plants for lightyears and lightyears.
[19:50:59] <ProfSimm> And then Forky understood
[19:51:23] <ProfSimm> This is basically what happens with us when we try to contemplate the universe when we only understand few basic things from our immediate experience
[19:52:08] <ProfSimm> Atque: isolated island tribes tend to think their island is the center of the world and they're the only humans.
[19:52:27] <ProfSimm> Atque: it's a pragmatic assumption. But basically never correct
[19:52:40] <ProfSimm> Atque: of course pragmatic and correct are often at odds
[19:52:44] <Atque> ProfSimm: But we don't just understand a few basic things. We have physical models that quite accurately explain movements of planets, bodies etc. You worldview seems like you picture some pre-Enlightenment world where spirits lay behind every rock, cliff and tree.
[19:53:20] <ProfSimm> Atque: at any point in their history, humans thought they know quite a lot. And were wrong. But I'm 100% sure you're right this time /s
[19:53:23] <Atque> ProfSimm: There is a great deal of certainty that the world doesn't work in that way.
[19:54:07] <ProfSimm> Yes there's a great deal of certainty.
[19:54:19] <ProfSimm> Certainty is on the pragmatic side, so you can sleep at night
[19:54:26] <ProfSimm> So we evolved to be very certain
[19:55:18] <ProfSimm> As Lovecraft said, one of the most merciful things in the universe is how fragmented our knowledge is, and how ignorant we are, because if we weren't we'd be terrified.
[19:55:53] <ProfSimm> Well that's his take as a horror writer. My take is we'd be confused. Like monkey on a physics exam.
[19:56:02] <ProfSimm> But sufficient confusion leads to terror.
[19:58:31] <ProfSimm> Atque: look what my example with "zooming into cat and rock" were trying to show is that our categories have context. Outside this context they are meaningless. You can't determine life when looking at cat atoms and rock atoms or can you
[19:59:02] <ProfSimm> Atque: what makes you think you're ready to judge the whole universe. It's simply arrogant, and maybe laughable to someone aside observing this conversation who knows a bit more

[20:00:21] <ProfSimm> You assume, you're certain. Of course.

[20:45:35] <mycroftiv> and i ALSO LOOKED AT THE PICTURES, forgive my all caps
[20:45:36] <em> I say "hey google" but that doesn't do anything if the screen isn't already active.
[20:46:01] <mycroftiv> em: can i ask if the fingers that are typing right now are mostly piano fingers or mostly IF fingers?
[20:46:25] <mycroftiv> and the pictures showed happy kids getting food i think
[20:46:45] <em> What's IF? My fingers aren't very big I guess.
[20:47:00] <Delf> I was thinking maybe you can teach me a thing or two about it
[20:47:17] <mycroftiv> and i dont give a fukk really in the final analysis about whether kids get fed because of plazma physics or what-have-you that is more real - mean it matters - but sacred work is feeding the kids, however it happens
[20:48:08] <Delf> The fields coming in the level of strength that our bodies are able to absorb, similar to that from the food we ingest
[20:49:07] <Delf> It's not your respect I want mate. You mentioned a condition you have which I thought perhaps can be reversed
[20:49:24] <mycroftiv> but we are all babies and we all need feeding and the science of growing food and recycling is sure in great need too
[20:49:25] <Panther>  So if I make General Tsuo's chicken and gave it to a dog and the dog refuses to eat it, it is still my General Tsuo's chicken?
[20:50:51] <em> Yes because it is your dog.
[20:51:21] <Panther> Well.. I didn't say it was my dog, but does that make a difference?
[20:52:45] <mycroftiv> i personally just want stuff to be efficient and if we are freeforming to me voluntary family cannibalism is classic idea, have a garden, fertilize it, etc
