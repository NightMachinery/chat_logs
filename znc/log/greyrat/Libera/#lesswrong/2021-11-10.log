[00:23:18] <RiversHaveWings> i was thinking of training a vae+diffusion hybrid at some point to try to get a small latent to condition on that could maybe be more disentangled/interpretable, like a GAN's latent space
[00:24:14] <RiversHaveWings> like, image goes into encoder, encoder outputs means + log variances for a latent, you sample from the output distributions, and condition the diffusion decoder on the sampled result
[00:24:24] <RiversHaveWings> encoder and diffusion decoder are trained end-to-end
[00:24:49] <RiversHaveWings> encoder has KL loss vs N(0, 1) on its output distributions.
[00:25:27] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: that one looks a lot more plausible. utsuho from touhou maybe...
[00:25:43] <RiversHaveWings> (i have already done diffusion autoencoders and diffusion discrete VAEs, the continuous VAE would probably work too)
[00:27:03] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: the endpoints for that one were two existing images i had laying around
[00:27:38] <RiversHaveWings> i have pushed the script that produced these grids to the repo
[00:28:41] <RiversHaveWings> you can pick between a random latent and an arbitrary starting image for either endpoint
[00:29:25] <RiversHaveWings> I should probably add a function to compute log likelihood/bits per dimension, if I could figure out how this is done

There is a sense that the individuals are trying to protect themselves and/or escape from a possible threat of bodily
[02:35:28] <feepbot> injury.[6] Although people may seem to be awake during a night terror, they will appear confused, be inconsolable and/or unresponsive to attempts to communicate with them, and may not recognize others familiar to them. Occasionally, when a person with a night terror is awakened, they will lash out at the one awakening them, which can be dangerous to that individual. Most people who

[03:31:22] <kuudes> saturn2, rsaarelm would the paint mixing be useful concept of thought? if you pour blue paint into a container where there is yellow paint carefully, so that you then have a volume of blue paint and volume of yellow paint, you are in state A. and when you take a tool and mix them, you get mixed paint that is green, state B. you could theoretically apply some sort of specific movements to reverse from B -> A but in practice you can't, because there are so 
[03:31:22] <kuudes> much more states that are alike B than there are states that are alike A. therefore A has lower entropy, B has larger entropy
[03:36:10] <kuudes> or if we feel that blue and yellow are still too culturally defined (they are not, because they are color of sky and color of sun); we could use the contaner that has gas. if you project force into the container, the gas will lag by inertia, and then flock to one side of the container, causing internal pressure differential - in extreme one side of container could be empty of gas. this is state A. then when the force ceases, the random heat movement 
[03:36:10] <kuudes> causes the gas molecules to bounce from each other and spread about evenly, equalizing pressure, state B. it is possible that the random heat movement would also cause the gas to flock to one side and leave another empty, but this is vastly less probable than the other way around, therefore A is rarer state than B and A is therefore lower entropy and B is higher entropy

[04:11:06] <PlanckWalk> Entropy is basically a measure of volume in some state-space.  If you pick any single configuration you (surprise!) get to say that it's low-entropy.
[04:11:41] <PlanckWalk> The mistake is then to conclude that entropy is observer-dependent.
[04:12:36] <PlanckWalk> The only observer-dependent part is that the observer gets to decide which region they're measuring the volume of.

[04:31:57] <saturn2> kuudes: whatever state the universe ends up in after the big bang is also unlikely
[04:35:29] <kuudes> yes, but less unlikely than the state of big bang
[04:35:51] <saturn2> i don't think so
[04:35:57] <kuudes> why?
[04:37:36] <saturn2> there are more possible ways the universe could go after the big bang, but there's only one way it actually did go

[04:40:11] <kuudes> I am uncertain on if that is true

[04:40:42] <saturn2> as unlikely as it is for every particle in the universe to jump back inside a basketball-size sphere, it's even less likely for them all to jump back to the exact state they were in yesterday
[04:41:03] <kuudes> I think that is false
[04:41:19] <kuudes> yesterday's configuration seems much more likely to get than the basketball of light
[04:41:35] <kuudes> both are very unlikely, that I agree on
[04:42:49] <kuudes> feynmann's idea is that basicly the world is sort of doing constant back-and-forth in time somehow, and much more than 1 path for a particle gets actually drawn
[04:43:03] <kuudes> but as most of them cancel each other out, the average is usually what remains
[04:43:47] <kuudes> ie when you throw a ball, it can go in various trajectories other than a parabola of gravity, but mostly those alternative trajectories get each cancelled out by backwards in time paths
[04:44:04] <kuudes> so what remains is about the same as parabola of gravity path
[04:44:50] <saturn2> how does that relate to entropy?
[04:44:53] <kuudes> I guess basicly macroscopic things would just be also quantum foam, but the standard deviation of quantum fluctuations is just too small to observe
[04:45:08] <kuudes> it relates to "<saturn2> there are more possible ways the universe could go after the big bang, but there's only one way it actually did go"
[04:49:14] <saturn2> if the universe did go back to the state it was in at the big bang, it's very unlikely that the planet earth would form again the same way and have the same history, right?
[04:49:53] <kuudes> I think so, yes
[04:52:30] <kuudes> hmm, I am envisioning a thought tool: lets take a tree, where we start with a node. for each travel step, we pick from all nodes connected to the current node and a new node with uniform random. ie we start with 0 nodes, so we create a new node A with p=1 and move to that. then we have 0 nodes connected to that so we create a new node B and move to that with p=1. then we either move back to node A with p(A)=1/2 or create new node C with p(C)=1/2. we 
[04:52:30] <kuudes> repeat this process
[04:53:02] <kuudes> big bang is node A. earth having been formed is node GHEAS...BAA
[04:53:24] <kuudes> our current state is GHEAS...BAA...KHW
[04:53:57] <kuudes> so it is much easier to move to yesterday's configuration, than to big bang
[04:55:19] <kuudes> but it indeed clearly is possible to move back to node A, and also then to move back to current state
[04:56:30] <kuudes> I guess the most probable thing in that sort of game is to keep near the edge where there are few nodes, and create new nodes? but also travel some amount back in time
[05:15:11] <catern> my knowledge of geopolitics and twitter gossip and ??? helped me earlier today - my partner and I were wondering why this falafel restaurant we ordered from had such lavishly over-designed packaging, and such a finely decorated and designed interior (which we saw on pictures on google). we were wondering this until we turned the packaging over and saw - "Established in Dubai in 2017"
[05:15:44] <catern> the lavish overdesigning is the product of some Arabian failson's endless family money
[05:16:34] <catern> clear, this random single NYC location of their international brand is their attempt to be a Successful Entrepreneur using their oil and shipping money
[05:16:45] <catern> clearly*
[05:20:20] <kuudes> sounds like a potentially good place to eat
[05:20:53] <catern> it's similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GarfieldEats
[05:21:03] <kuudes> ie the company might make loss, so if it does not make too much mistakes, at least the customers could eat well and get better than their money's worth

[05:21:20] <catern> kuudes: no, it's not like a startup burning VC money
[05:21:24] <kuudes> I suppose the local operators could pocket the loss profit though
[05:21:27] <kuudes> hmm
[05:21:48] <catern> the food was just okay - it's only the branding and concept that they lavishly overspent on
[05:21:54] <catern> rather than it evolving through natural selection

[05:27:31] <kuudes> so indeed with the proposed rules the frontier expands, but slower than just creating a new state at each point, and the current state is mostly very near to the edge of the newly created states, but not on the edge
[05:28:16] <kuudes> on average, states have little less than 2 connected states, ie past and future

[06:09:16] <SDr> probably the best I heard so far is forced interoperability: by making timelines available via API (via rss/pubsub/etc), other peeps could launch competing social networks in a decentralized fashion (like email), breaking network effects; and those other services could provide filtering / etc that would be non-user-hostile

[15:28:48] <feep[work]> "read twenty extraordinary tax stories" no thank you :D
[15:34:10] <rsaarelm> So they took my money and used it to make videos about how cool it is that they get to take people's money.

[18:01:10] <catern> so it's like the opposite of the practice of including a length or window size in your messages so that the recipient knows how big of a buffer to allocate
[18:04:54] <catern> unrelatedly, what's a good word that's halfway between "project" and "team"/"group"?

[21:58:31] <kuudes> also it was not even just the minimum, but about 2 degrees worth of work in study points
[21:58:43] <kuudes> so something like 11 years studying in 1 year
[21:59:14] <kuudes> gwern, if some of your friends wants extremely smart people, she seems like a good candidate

[22:13:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> linear: "One downside to mention is that it does seem challenging to keep some styles of baked goods crunchy with allulose as the only sugar" ... what is the cause of this?
[22:13:19] <vrs> one year is essentially no cost in terms of soft skills
[22:13:50] <kuudes> she also has in long math either the second best or best grade
[22:14:34] <linear> Obormot\Arcturus: that's a great question, especially because I'm not sure I actually know. Gonna see if I can find out rq perhaps
[22:14:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> linear: (Also, if it's 70% as sweet, then I'll have to add almost 1.5x as much of it to a baked good to get the same sweetness, but that'll seriously affect the texture, rise, etc., won't it? Or will it?)
[22:14:42] <kuudes> laudatur, best grade
[22:15:02] <kuudes> so she has at least top 5% in both mother tongue and mathematics, likely higher
[22:15:20] <kuudes> no obvious lacks in any subject, much more subjects than typically
[22:16:13] <kuudes> ah, all other grades are laudatur but english and russia are only eximia, second best grade
[22:16:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> linear: Another (less important but still relevant) question: does yeast eat allulose, and are the results the same as if yeast is fed white sugar or honey?
[22:16:28] <two2thehead> kuudes, hm
[22:16:59] <two2thehead> ah those 4 hour sleeper people
[22:17:18] <linear> Obormot\Arcturus: might be the case, but one assumption I usually have with people that like baking with alternative sugars/flours/etc is that it's often common that they actually want it *less* sweet than is typical, and a 30% reduction in the sweetness of e.g. most cookies I think would be more than fine
[22:17:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This is much more likely to occur if you, for example, eat an entire batch of allulose cookies by yourself (who would do such a thing..!?)" ... >_>
[22:18:15] <linear> <_<
[22:18:22] <linear> also no studies in yeast afaict, mostly was humans/mice
[22:18:57] <kuudes> so mother tongue, long math, social studies, history, long english, long german, medium swedish, philosophy, religion are laudatur and short russian and short hebrew are eximias
[22:19:32] <kuudes> so general intelligence is top of charts, both verbal and process, though preferences are verbal clearly
[22:19:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> linear: Hmm, so this is an interesting point but I don't think is a satisfactory answer, because: 1. It's true that many (most?) (especially, though not exclusively, *American*) published dessert recipes have too much sugar, so a reduction in sweetness is just the thing; BUT, 2. A recipe that has *already* been calibrated for more reasonable amounts of sweetness (and attendant adjustments, if need be, of other ingredients for
[22:19:47] <Obormot\Arcturus>  texture and so on) will suffer significantly if its sweetness is cut by 30%!
[22:20:56] <linear> yeah, and this is biased by my own views, since, like, I find most american desserts excessively sweet too

[22:21:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> linear: e.g. if you took most of the recipes I make (that I've selected or optimized, and now endorse), such as https://wiki.obormot.net/Cookbook/BirdsMilkCake ... if you then cut the sweetness by 30%, they become unworkable

[22:29:22] <Obormot\Gaia> BUT IN THEORY I CAN >:(
[22:29:45] <linear> it should be pretty much the same then, since honey seems to just be fructose+glucose, several of the studies use those for benchmarks as well
[22:29:57] <Obormot\Gaia> The same as
[22:29:58] <Obormot\Gaia> allulose?
[22:30:13] <linear> as in allulose vs. sugar <-> allulose vs. honey would be very comparable 
[22:30:29] <linear> but also one reason I think it's notable is because e.g. eating a pizza vs. eating a pizza with a bit of alllulose, the latter should be *better*
[22:30:37] <linear> so it's beyond just a substition effect of 'this means you will have less sugar'

[23:45:34] <catern> gwern: what do you mean? I agree Hanson's thing is the paradox of the firm, but this Matt Levine thing about options is an interesting observation about the structure of limited liability
[23:45:55] <catern> which is that if you combine two corporations into one, they can't independently go bankrupt anymore, which is why you'd prefer to have them separate
[23:46:14] <catern> so maybe that's an answer to why you can't just buy two companies and not touch them

[23:47:59] <catern> I guess my point is: paradox of the firm would apply even if there wasn't limited liability - even if we didn't have limited liability, I think we'd still have firms (for the usual reasons)
[23:48:46] <catern> but limited liability is an extra reason why we have firms which I hadn't thought through until right now... and maybe that implies the usual arguments for firms aren't as strong as I thought they were
[23:49:07] <ggreer> (mistrial with prejudice is done when the prosecution knows they're going to lose, so they deliberately fuck up to create a mistrial and therefore retrial. mistrial with prejudice means there can be no retrial)
[23:52:44] <saturn2> it's amazing how everyone thought the 2020 riots were going to be world-changing and now hardly anyone cares

[23:53:39] <saturn2> all they really wanted was biden all along
[23:53:47] <ggreer> "You decided you needed to run because of the fire in the Duramax?" "Yes." "Why? What was so urgent?" (baffled) "It was a fire?"
[23:56:11] <gwern> saturn2: they should've just been biden their time, instead of provoking a trumplash
[23:57:32] <catern> gwern: oh, I confused myself, lol. I see what you mean now. yes true, it's the same paradox of the firm at a different size
[23:57:35] <catern> it also raises the same (very practical) question "why don't companies simply buy large numbers of slaves and let them act freely and just sell their incomes as a security"
[23:57:57] <gwern> that one at least has clear incentive problems
[23:58:41] <catern> well, they'd retain 50% of their income or something
[23:59:03] <catern> or... they'd be compensated in... their own stock...?
[23:59:21] <gwern> but if you only get half your income, you're still discouraged from working, just like with a 50% income tax
[23:59:24] *** Joins: Urchin[emacs] (~user@user/urchin)
[23:59:41] <catern> yes, so I suppose this is another reason why you can't just buy a company and not touch it
[23:59:44] <gwern> anyway, companies can't buy such slaves because the government already owns them all :)
