[01:25:28] <wasamasa> mario-goulart: not sure whether readline allows for this actually
[01:25:31] <wasamasa> mario-goulart: might make more sense to instead reimplement history yourself
[01:26:45] <wasamasa> mario-goulart: for MAL I had to repeatedly call add_history with lines from a file on startup, then append to that file for every readline call
[01:27:01] <wasamasa> mario-goulart: that omits all the nice configurables for the history library, but eh

[23:11:16] <siiky> Bunny351: RE Git rebasing (b): that's just the nature of the model and references. How do other VCSs do this? Not that anyone mentioned Hg, but from the brief time I was forced to use it, it looked similar (except it was slow AF!)
[23:12:17] <siiky> about being confusing/hard to use, yeah, it's a fair bit... but that's not being over engineered, it's having a bad UI/UX
[23:12:45] <Zipheir> Rebase and squash are EVIL.
[23:14:10] <Zipheir> siiky: It's also one of the few VCS systems that treats commits as objects that can disappear if branch structure changes.
[23:14:56] <Zipheir> Of course, a lot of them have *added* the ability to make commits disappear due to git's popularity.
[23:16:15] <Zipheir> I have to emphasize that there's nothing in git's model that forces you to use those features, though.
[23:21:58] <fantazo> Zipheir: ssshhh... git was envisioned by one of the greatest master minds ever in computing: linus torvalds. it must be perfect. never criticize the work of gods!
[23:24:44] <Zipheir> fantazo: Hahah.
[23:25:51] <Zipheir> (Linus: Decentralized VCSs are superior! Fast merges are all you need.  Also Linus: Here's a bunch of nasty tools so you don't have to merge.)
[23:26:42] <Zipheir> Sorry, enough harping from me.
