[00:05:03] <SleePy> Next to our main network closet is a stair case.  So up in the crawl space is a big cavity..  Extra fiber/network cable just gets tossed into it..  Don't know how much is in there, but yea..
[00:05:21] <sintax> sounds like you got fiber to run in your house haha
[00:06:01] <vinrock> or wait til copper hits $4/lb again
[00:06:04] <iphone> I just dumped some fiber

[00:06:30] <vinrock> im talkin scrap value for copper
[00:06:47] <vinrock> it went over $4/lb like 9 years ago

[00:08:16] <SleePy> All mobile devices/tablets at our work require it.  Desktops in the office don't, but are capable of doing it

[00:09:43] <iphone> back in the day pcs used to have locks on them. 
[00:09:45] <SleePy> easier to dispose of the drives?  Just pop the drive and toss it in a bin.  Unless they get your recovery key, that data is useless.  Without a matching PC with the right TPM key, its not booting either
[00:10:14] <sd> 02<W‚Äãant a new job!> I guess thats it.
[00:10:39] <sd> 02<W‚Äãant a new job!> But they have to know how to get to the hard drive

[00:11:49] <vinrock> i did all nvme drives in these desktops when i did the win10 upgrade and bought new hw
[00:11:59] <vinrock> curious how they hold up over time
[00:12:11] <SleePy> Our goal with bitlocker was to ensure if a device is stolen, no company data is at risk..  They can reformat it and have a computer, but no company data can be taken.

[07:48:55] <Hunterkll> @Roca Essentials DOES allow you to set up hyper-v role
[07:49:13] <Hunterkll> IF and ONLY IF you install just the hyper-v role on essentials, then install essentials in a hyper-v guest VM, that's what the Essentials windows license covers 
[07:49:28] <Hunterkll> You can use any other windows licenses, linux, whatever, in the system - there's no technical/license limit on amount of VMs you have
[07:49:36] <Hunterkll> it's just how many windows licenses you have that is your "real" cap
[07:50:16] <Hunterkll> do NOT actually install the essentials role though, iirc.... 
[07:51:09] <Hunterkll> the ONLY role you can install is Hyper-V and supporting features (such as iSCSI to access iSCSI remote volumes, etc)
[07:58:47] <xe0n> is it 5pm?
[08:02:15] <sd> 12<R‚Äãoca> Ah, you are correct! It's nearly to call it a night, but we'll see what happens with this HyperV role is done installing. Maybe we will start our weekend early LOL

[16:54:26] <Joe-Developer> so the teachers have archived all the teams from last year
[16:54:29] <Activ8> pish it real good
[16:54:33] <Joe-Developer> but some kids still have overdue assignments
[16:54:36] <Activ8> push*
[16:54:41] <Joe-Developer> and can't get rid of them because the teams are archived
[16:54:48] <Activ8> iPhone autocorrecting lol
[16:55:03] <thegodsquirrel> RIP Wayne Static
[16:55:08] <technonerd> dont worry i thought to salt n pepa too
[16:55:20] <Oliber> Joe-Developer: course rollover is always horrific
[16:55:31] <PublicWiFi> "only you sexy people"
[16:55:39] <Joe-Developer> yeah
[16:55:40] <PublicWiFi> damn guess I can't dance, thanks salt-n-pepa
[16:55:44] <Joe-Developer> I can't find anything anywhere about it
[16:55:46] <Activ8> Ha ha 
[16:55:49] <PublicWiFi> technonerd: ++
[16:55:54] <Joe-Developer> the only solution I've found is remove them from the team
[16:56:01] <Joe-Developer> but then what if they have work they want to look back at
[16:56:01] <Activ8> is that like a parody to salt and pepper 
[16:56:25] <Oliber> it's like Teams isn't ready to be an LMS
[16:58:56] <Joe-Developer> I just hate it
[16:59:03] <Joe-Developer> can't wait until it's all automated
[16:59:06] <Joe-Developer> and staff don't make the teams
[16:59:29] <cryptic1> should have made notes each year
[16:59:30] <Joe-Developer> which *fingers crossed* will be for the start of the next academic year if we find the money
[16:59:46] <cryptic1> why would anyone assume previous years contact would be available for review
[16:59:54] <cryptic1> s/contact/content
[16:59:54] <layer8> cryptic1 meant: "why would anyone assume previous years content would be available for review"
[17:00:08] <PublicWiFi> so i have a weird situation
[17:00:11] * Joe-Developer thinking
[17:00:12] <PublicWiFi> with my automation project
[17:00:20] <xe0n> its TOO good
[17:00:23] <xe0n> so they'll get rid of you?
[17:00:31] <xe0n> shit dawg, coded yourself out of a job, good one
[17:00:32] <PublicWiFi> there are 2 pieces of information i need to store in this database in order to pull accurate reports
[17:00:34] <xe0n> living the dream
[17:00:43] <PublicWiFi> but they are 100% manually entered values that can CANNOT use automation to gather
[17:00:48] <Joe-Developer> nah you code yourself out of a job but don't tell anyone
[17:00:52] <PublicWiFi> Joe-Developer: ++++
[17:01:13] <Joe-Developer> that's annoying PublicWiFi 
[17:01:14] <PublicWiFi> so I need a way to import these 2 manual values to the DB... maybe I should setup a simple web app?
[17:01:21] <Joe-Developer> possibly
[17:01:25] <PublicWiFi> but then someone could enter garbage data
[17:01:27] <PublicWiFi> ugh
[17:01:27] <Joe-Developer> can you give context or not really
[17:01:33] <PublicWiFi> yes but itll make you sad
[17:01:37] <xe0n> LOL
[17:01:40] <Joe-Developer> go for it
[17:01:41] <xe0n> no, you already make us sad
[17:01:42] <xe0n> but go on.
[17:01:43] <Joe-Developer> I'm far too happy atm
[17:01:50] <xe0n> LOL
[17:01:53] <PublicWiFi> all of our data comes from a really old program that is now hosted as a SaaS product
[17:02:02] <xe0n> anddd thennn
[17:02:07] <PublicWiFi> the only way I can get data out of thier database on their side is in the form of RTF, TXT, or CSV
[17:02:08] <Joe-Developer> andd thennnnnnn
[17:02:13] <PublicWiFi> so im parsing hella CSVs lol
[17:02:14] <Joe-Developer> AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN 
[17:02:32] <Joe-Developer> xe0n, I was legitimately thinking about that as I saw you send it LOL
[17:02:35] <PublicWiFi> i take said CSVs, parse them, and enter the data i need from them into a postgres DB
[17:02:46] <xe0n> :P
[17:03:02] <PublicWiFi> then use another script to pull the data from the DB and put it into some bullshit excel template they want me to use
[17:03:09] <Joe-Developer> https://youtu.be/oqwzuiSy9y0
[17:03:13] <PublicWiFi> but with the 2 pieces of info missing and i can't make the full report
[17:03:21] <xe0n> why not parse the csvs into a spreadsheet?
[17:03:21] <xe0n> lol
[17:03:35] <PublicWiFi> well
[17:03:37] <PublicWiFi> sorry
[17:03:41] <xe0n> :P
[17:03:46] <PublicWiFi> its up year-to-date info
[17:03:56] <xe0n> doesnt solve the problem of you needing manual data, just more so to make you fuck around more
[17:03:56] <xe0n> thats all
[17:03:58] *** Quits: jesse (~jesse@user/jesse) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:04:02] <PublicWiFi> easier to parse each month and add to the DB than keep up with lots of excel sheets
[17:04:17] <Joe-Developer> I can understand the database middleman
[17:04:17] <xe0n> yeah best to save them as word perfect files instead
[17:04:20] <xe0n> :D
[17:04:22] <PublicWiFi> xD
[17:04:44] <PublicWiFi> so I just need to find a way to get these 2 pieces of data into my DB after the fact without fucking up the data integrity
[17:04:52] <Joe-Developer> hmm
[17:05:01] <PublicWiFi> but -I- do not want to be the one to enter the data cause Im not in the Billing dept
[17:05:03] <PublicWiFi> lol
[17:05:11] <Joe-Developer> so
[17:05:15] <Joe-Developer> make an MS form or something
[17:05:39] <PublicWiFi> I geuss my issue is
[17:05:55] <PublicWiFi> i need a way to tell who add what to the DB and have the ability to revert or some shit lol
[17:05:57] <Joe-Developer> are you wanting to avoid any human error possible?
[17:05:58] <PublicWiFi> like a fuckin wiki 
[17:06:00] <PublicWiFi> yes
[17:06:08] <PublicWiFi> but with 2 manual info pieces its hard to do :S
[17:06:16] <sd> 12<f‚Äãelda> Realizing that I'm not that brainy, but I am filled with passion / rage at life, so I do IT out of spite.

A Twitch Turbo for one month costs $8.  3 hours of fucking around vs just buying Twitch Turbo Hmmm yes I do spe
[17:06:19] <Joe-Developer> i mean
[17:06:26] <Joe-Developer> if the human error isn't made by you
[17:06:28] <sd> 12<f‚Äãelda> (‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè)
[17:06:31] <Joe-Developer> it's not *your* issue
[17:06:34] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[17:06:45] <technonerd> copy pasta fail
[17:06:47] <PublicWiFi> I guess so long as they have the ability to re-write the data again to fix it
[17:06:52] <Joe-Developer> Soon I won't touch the onboarding process
[17:06:55] <xe0n> wtf felda
[17:06:59] <PublicWiFi> i mean they would only have the ability to insert data into those 2 columns...
[17:07:01] <xe0n> LOL
[17:07:05] <Joe-Developer> HR will input new starters into our MIS and a bit of software will do the rest
[17:07:07] <xe0n> you taking those weed pills again?
[17:07:14] <Joe-Developer> so if their name is spelt wrong or whatever it's HR's problem
[17:07:27] <sd> 12<f‚Äãelda> xe0n sometimes I wonder how my brain even keeps me alive lel
[17:07:48] <technonerd> brain must be running pfsense
[17:08:06] <sd> 12<f‚Äãelda> my brain runs on ip tables
[17:08:11] <PublicWiFi> so
[17:08:17] <sd> 12<f‚Äãelda> I need to upgrade to a better filter
[17:08:21] <crustacean> iptables are fine
[17:08:24] <crustacean> i like iptables
[17:08:28] <PublicWiFi> Joe-Developer: think some shitty php/javascript solution on an internal web app would do it?
[17:08:28] <crustacean> they are easy
[17:08:39] <PublicWiFi> I mean I just need to find a way to authenticate so just no rando can change shit ofc
[17:08:39] <xe0n> he's running pihole with lame lists that block pornos
[17:08:42] <xe0n> so he's going a bit crazy
[17:09:01] <crustacean> xe0n: Please I am getting bored I need to do something with the lab
[17:09:08] <xe0n> wtf
[17:09:10] <crustacean> Enligthen me 
[17:09:14] <Joe-Developer> PublicWiFi, yeah I reckon that'd work. Depends how much time you wanna spend on it
[17:09:21] <xe0n> if you cant work that stuff out yourself, maybe this aint for you
[17:09:22] <xe0n> lol!
[17:09:31] <Joe-Developer> the easy but more "clustered" option is an MS form that spits out a spreadsheet
[17:09:33] <xe0n> :P
[17:09:41] <Joe-Developer> but then you've got more shite and you can't pump info from the db into the form
[17:09:43] <xe0n> use the lab instead of just installing shit
[17:09:46] <xe0n> thats a good idea :P
[17:09:54] <Joe-Developer> so the php page would deffo be ideal
[17:09:58] <crustacean> Mostly depression setting in and having no long term goal
[17:10:02] <Joe-Developer> coz you can read and write via that
[17:10:04] <PublicWiFi> right
[17:10:05] <xe0n> why not just use windows integrated auth?
[17:10:08] <PublicWiFi> ^
[17:10:11] <Joe-Developer> add in some authentication
[17:10:12] <PublicWiFi> thisis what i was thinin
[17:10:22] <PublicWiFi> just gotta figure out how to do that in JS or whatever
[17:10:24] <Joe-Developer> or heck use sso
[17:10:27] <xe0n> something something AD group something something IIS
[17:10:29] <PublicWiFi> I know my dokuwiki instance does that, its dope
[17:10:42] <PublicWiFi> auto-login using windows auth
[17:10:46] <Joe-Developer> yeee
[17:10:49] <Joe-Developer> that's just
[17:10:52] * Joe-Developer chefs kiss
[17:11:03] <xe0n> errr sure, or just restrict who can view the page via a group
[17:11:04] <PublicWiFi> hmmm
[17:11:06] <xe0n> but okay sure
[17:11:09] <PublicWiFi> xe0n: right!
[17:11:11] <PublicWiFi> well
[17:11:14] <PublicWiFi> not auto-login
[17:11:21] <PublicWiFi> but im saying I know a non-windows server can do it
[17:11:23] <PublicWiFi> so there's a way :D
[17:11:32] <Joe-Developer> depending how handy you are with webdev
[17:11:40] <PublicWiFi> not handy at all
[17:11:42] <Joe-Developer> I can recommend laravel as a good php framework
[17:11:47] <xe0n> loll
[17:11:54] <PublicWiFi> took me 3 hours to build a simple form to validate addresses using USPS API lol

[17:45:35] <PublicWiFi> okay i think some of you are coming into this mid=convo
[17:45:38] <csws> wait so your exchange box is all basic auth?
[17:45:51] <PublicWiFi> I have a form I want to put on an internal web page that lets certain users insert data into a DB
[17:45:56] <PublicWiFi> so its a super simple thing, just need auth
[17:46:08] <PublicWiFi> also dont wanna buy a windows std license just for 1 shitty form lol
[17:46:13] <PublicWiFi> or windwos 10 pro
[17:46:14] <csws> haha
[17:46:15] <PublicWiFi> xD
[17:46:17] <csws> I had an idea
[17:46:22] <csws> let's just throw this out there for xe0n's reaction
[17:46:25] <csws> you've got an exchange box
[17:46:26] <PublicWiFi> yes pls

[17:46:42] <PublicWiFi> i mean it would work but that's fucked
[17:46:44] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[17:46:46] <CptLuxx> solid solution
[17:46:51] <csws> hahaha
[17:47:15] <PublicWiFi> i mean if the nginx plugin uses LDAPS I'm sure its fine
[17:47:19] <PublicWiFi> pretty old standard
[17:47:58] <csws> yeah hardest part there is getting it to trust your CA lol
[17:48:16] <PublicWiFi> right? ezpz
[17:48:18] <csws> you don't need to use LDAPS unless you're doing password resets too
[17:48:28] <csws> and that behaviour can be turned off if you're a lunatic too

[22:33:56] <CoJaBo> PhotoDNA is a visual/image hash, not a file hash.
[22:34:33] <CoJaBo> Ours works in a similar way; file hashing doesn't work for this task, as uploading an image or video file is almost guaranteed to change the hash.

[22:36:16] <CoJaBo> The apple one is unusually creepy, because they scan encrypted data, and send hits to humans to review. So people are rooting thru any pics you take on your phone everytime there's a false-positive.

[22:41:50] <CoJaBo> Hotmess: The point was, calling it "porn" normalizes it, makes it look like it's just taboo and not a heinous crime.
[22:42:39] <sd> 06<A‚Äãda> it is porn tho
[22:42:51] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> thats a pol discussion not a techinal one

[22:43:39] <sd> 06<A‚Äãda> but maybe my brain is just strange with language
[22:43:49] <CoJaBo> They're using the term "porn" to imply it's consensual when it's not. We don't like to enable paedos by using paedo terminology for criminal acts.
