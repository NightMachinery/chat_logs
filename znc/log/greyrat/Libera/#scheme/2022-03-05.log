[05:37:41] <aeth> Geometry goes back over 2000 years. Perfectly-valid, modern geometry. Elements was a textbook for over 2000 years and it's about 2300 years old.
[05:38:02] <aeth> But then there's some things like Lisp that date to the '50s/'60s
[05:38:51] <aeth> But for people born after the 1960s, both seem like they have been around "forever"
[05:40:22] <aeth> OK, someone's going to say that "modern" should mean "non-Euclidean" or whatever and is thus a 19th century invention, but "The debate that eventually led to the discovery of the non-Euclidean geometries began almost as soon as Euclid wrote Elements." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry
[05:40:45] <aeth> But I mean, Euclidean geometry is something we still use today. Unlike whatever science they were using 2300 years ago

[18:54:05] <edgar-rft> jcowan: there are things that are well-known but not well-understood.
[18:54:06] <Zipheir> jcowan: What dpk said.
[18:55:22] <edgar-rft> in the sense of: everybody knows what it is but nobody knows how it works
[18:55:39] <Zipheir> "nobody before 1706 had the idea of observing things"  What do axioms have to do with observing things, though?
[18:57:01] <Zipheir> But I know that some talk of "the analytic sciences" in addition to the empirical, so I suppose it's a matter of terminology.
[18:57:35] <Zipheir> Aristotle totally had the idea of observing things, BTW, but his reasons for doing so were backwards by our current model.
[18:57:43] <dpk> i meant more to reject the notion that 'the scientific method' is a single concept which just sprang into existence at the Enlightenment
[18:58:15] <edgar-rft> maybe nobody before 1706 had observed that idea? :-)
[18:58:17] <Zipheir> The Enlightenment would be way too late, in any case.
[18:58:43] <Zipheir> dpk: But otherwise I agree.
[18:59:03] <Zipheir> Lots of pieces.
[19:07:33] <Zipheir> jcowan: I haven't emailed the ml yet, but I'm currently still in favor of keeping the "polyvariadic" form of lambda*.  I haven't seen any particularly confusing behavior with it.
[19:08:24] <Zipheir> Of course, Marc considers the whole thing confusing, so it's a matter of taste.
[19:08:32] <jcowan> Okay, thanks
[19:11:29] <Zipheir> I have been trying to come up with nasty examples!  But nothing to justify cutting it, yet.
