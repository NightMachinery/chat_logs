[13:49:49] <maximilian90> hey, I try to set up Bitcoincore on my Debian11, it tells me it will download and process the whole Bitcoin block chain, 420GB big. Does it mean, I need to have 420GB free of space on my HDD to use bitcoincore as a bitcoin wallet?
[13:51:44] <yoda> 420 GB?
[13:51:48] <yoda> how so?
[13:53:12] <maximilian90> Well it says to me: "When you click OK, Bitcoin Core will begin to download and process the full Bitcoin block chain (420GB) starting with the easliest trasnsaction in 2009 when Bitcoin initially launched.
[13:53:52] <yoda> It is 375 GB
[13:54:31] <yoda> You don't have SSD?
[13:54:54] <maximilian90> no, I don't have
[13:55:26] <maximilian90> Is there no wallet for Linux which doesn't take much space
[13:55:31] <yoda> answering your initial question, yes, you need that free space to use Bitcoin Core as your wallet
[13:55:39] <yoda> there is
[13:55:47] <yoda> https://electrum.org
[13:56:08] <yoda> you don't need to download the entire blockchain with electrum.

[14:08:44] <maximilian90> Also can I use prune mode right from the start? As far as I read, I need to open the wallet first, then I can edit the configuration file. But I cannot open the wallet before I created it (which I don't know how to do without prune mode)
[14:17:23] <yoda> maximilian90 dodo want you to run the taproot enabled node, you are not required to do so, electrum is great for privacy especially when using Tor with it.

[14:18:17] <AndyS2_> yoda: so the electrum server doesn't get your ip, but they still know which UTXOs are yours
[14:18:29] <yoda> who cares?
[14:18:42] <yoda> Bitcoin is public by design
[14:18:48] <AndyS2_> not everything is public
[14:19:21] <muhkey> you can also prune the chain
[14:19:36] <muhkey> if you still want to use core and not store it all
[14:19:56] <AndyS2_> "nobody" knows you own two UTXOs that correspond to different addresses if you didn't tell anybody or reused addresses
[14:20:29] <muhkey> if you are able to "hide" the fact you own a given address
[14:20:36] <AndyS2_> using an electrum server may leak that info (i.e. that those utxos are connected) even if you don't make a tx that uses both utxos
[14:20:39] <muhkey> btc is fairly pseudonimous
[14:21:07] <muhkey> yeah if you want full anonimity you need something like xmr
[14:21:27] <muhkey> you can use electrum over tor that can help somewhat
[14:22:10] <AndyS2_> If you want to support Bitcoin, don't spread info that can be abused and that might make coins less fungible
[14:22:56] <muhkey> AndyS2_, fair enough but never forget the fact as said before that btc is a transparent ledger
[14:22:59] <AndyS2_> We don't need another ten companies that slurp up all that sensitive data to sell them to the highest bidder
[14:23:00] <yoda> AndyS2_ muhkey only those need to hide whom are up for something bad, you can use electrum with Tor and use a different address all the time, you can also select the coins you want to use, electrum also has feature to freeze coins which are undependable until you unfreeze them.
[14:23:26] <AndyS2_> muhkey: until it isn't anymore :)

[14:24:14] <muhkey> we were talking about current implementation
[14:24:40] <yoda> AndyS2_ exposing public keys is very-very bad idea
[14:24:41] <muhkey> AndyS2_, yeah but that alone will allow to do some interesting things that will help in that sense afaik
[14:25:18] <AndyS2_> yoda: who cares which coins you select when your client asks the electrum server if they know about tx for <sends list of all your addresses> (not sure if electrum works like that in detail, but AFAIK it's something like that)

[14:26:28] <muhkey> also not as "anonymous" as most think
[14:26:37] <AndyS2_> first we had people thinking it was anonymous. then most people figured it's not, and now that privacy tech for bitcoin is becoming more widespread, people think it still can't be done, which is wrong
[14:26:52] <muhkey> I agree that chainanalysis is not very scalable and that alone will break it at some point
[14:27:42] <AndyS2_> yoda: The client subscribes to its own addresses (nit: sha256 hashes of scriptPubKeys) so that it would be notified of new transactions touching them. It also synchronizes the existing history of its addresses. This means the client sacrifices some privacy to the server, as the server can now reasonably guess that all these addresses belong to the same entity.
[14:27:59] <AndyS2_> so i guesss electrum "only" leaks hashes of the public keys in the general case
[14:28:12] <AndyS2_> https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html
[14:28:17] <yoda> s17 we disagree in that one, bitcoin should be public as possible, transparency is a key to success, a project which hides all the finances and the movement of the coins is very possibly up to something bad in which federal agencies maybe interested.

[20:52:59] <Caitlin454> Hello, I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Caitlin, the coinbase wallet's cloud mining salesman.
[20:52:59] <Caitlin454>   Right now the coinbase wallet encourages people to provide liquidity to their trading pool by posting smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain, you usually have to pay a fee for USDT tokens, become "gas", deposit the tokens to get an authorized node connection and will do a bonus of about 0.02 ETH and start the mining mechanism. Are you
[20:53:00] <Caitlin454> interested?

[23:45:52] <Klinda> 21:10] <Guest76> Hi, sorry to disturb you. I am Linda, the cloud mining salesperson of coinbase wallet.
[23:45:54] <Klinda> [21:10] <Guest76>  the coinbase wallet encourages people to provide liquidity to their trading pool by issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. You usually need to pay a fee to buy USDT tokens, which become "gas", deposit the tokens to obtain authorized node connections, and give 0.02ETH and start the mining mechanism. Are you interested?
