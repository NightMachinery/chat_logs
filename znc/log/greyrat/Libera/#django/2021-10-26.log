[00:35:48] <theprophet> can somebody please explain this text copied from django docs to me?
[00:35:50] <theprophet> The include() function allows referencing other URLconfs. Whenever Django encounters include(), it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.
[00:36:18] <theprophet> how is this part exactly works? can somebody give me an example?
[00:37:05] <dang`r`us> I think the tutorial has one
[00:37:23] <theprophet> yes but i am non english speaker and it confuses me
[00:37:39] <theprophet> The include() function allows referencing other URLconfs. Whenever Django encounters include(), it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.
[00:37:40] <theprophet> The idea behind include() is to make it easy to plug-and-play URLs. Since polls are in their own URLconf (polls/urls.py), they can be placed under “/polls/”, or under “/fun_polls/”, or under “/content/polls/”, or any other path root, and the app will still work.
[00:37:46] <theprophet> this is the full text
[00:37:54] <theprophet> but i dont understand in practice.
[00:37:59] <dang`r`us> hm no not the tutorial, but see here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/urls/#including-other-urlconfs
[00:38:47] <dang`r`us> so basically ... if you include() something, it takes the urls from "something" and puts it behind the path associated with the include
[00:39:23] <dang`r`us> let's say your aggregator app has a url 'home/'  and you do    path('community/', include('aggregator.urls')   then the final url will become 'community/home/'
[00:39:24] *** Joins: dre (~dre@120.156.30.159)
[00:39:36] <dang`r`us> and this is done for all urls that get included
[00:39:42] <dang`r`us> so, it's like a prefix
[00:40:11] <dang`r`us> (my link also has a concrete example; search for '/credit/reports/' there)
[00:40:46] <theprophet> what is final url?
[00:41:40] <theprophet> i know what url is
[00:41:47] <theprophet> but what do you mean final url?

[01:03:14] <dang`r`us> theprophet, the URL clients will be able to access
[01:03:23] <dang`r`us> you could also say "resulting" url
[01:03:31] <dang`r`us> "completely constructed" etc
[01:03:43] <dang`r`us> https://yourhost/credit/reports/
[01:03:55] <theprophet> so what include means is
[01:04:06] <theprophet> youtube/upload/video/hq
[01:04:11] <theprophet> like this?
[01:04:21] <theprophet> couple of links can work together?
[01:04:27] <theprophet> and next is triggered?
[01:04:50] <theprophet> dang`r`us
[01:05:10] <dang`r`us> it's not a chain of options, no
[01:05:15] <dang`r`us> it's concatenation
[01:05:24] <dang`r`us> adding a prefix
[01:05:39] <dang`r`us> I'm sorry to say but if you don't know these terms you will have a very hard time writing software
[01:05:45] <dang`r`us> unfortunately it's very English centered

[01:06:07] <theprophet> dang`r`us
[01:06:14] <dang`r`us> include does the opposite of chopping off
[01:06:24] <theprophet> but it says chop off
[01:06:26] <theprophet> litteraly
[01:06:42] <theprophet> it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.
[01:07:06] <theprophet> oh sigh
[01:07:08] <dang`r`us> yes, but the final result is a concatenated URL; the documentation explains it from the url dispatcher side, I'm explaining it from the browser side
[01:07:11] <theprophet> i am so confused
[01:07:30] *** Joins: AnselmoCampanas (~AnselmoCa@190.99.69.41)
[01:07:38] <theprophet> why there is no video example for this
[01:07:56] <dang`r`us> so the dispatcher sees: path('credit/', include(extra_patterns))
[01:08:19] <dang`r`us> it turns this into credit/reports, credit/reports/<int:id>, credit/charge
[01:08:38] <dang`r`us> each url from `extra_patterns` gets 'credit/'  prepended to it
[01:09:03] <dang`r`us> (this will only make sense if you look at my link)
[01:09:25] <dang`r`us> (because there is the definition of extra_patterns - a list of URL patterns)

[01:12:46] <theprophet> thank you

[01:13:10] <theprophet> i know that , in that urlpatern list i can include() urlconfs
[01:13:28] <theprophet> but what i dont understand is
[01:13:30] <theprophet> it says
[01:13:44] <theprophet> matched up to that point
[01:13:52] <theprophet> what is meant by matched up to that point?
[01:13:59] <theprophet> to what point exacly?
[01:14:17] <dang`r`us> in your example, 'polls/'
[01:14:34] <theprophet> and what is that point?
[01:14:36] <theprophet> where?
[01:14:39] <theprophet> when?
[01:14:50] <dang`r`us> it might be a bit confusing because your `polls.urls` only has an empty url
[01:15:19] <dang`r`us> but let's say `polls.urls` had an entry path named 'index/'  then you'd have 'https://your-site/polls/index/'
[01:15:23] <AnselmoCampanas> theprophet, generally, in Django project you have different applications. Each application, usually, you have a specific urls.py that manages all urls matching a path
[01:15:32] <theprophet> my polls url has this
[01:15:33] <theprophet> from django.urls import path
[01:15:34] <theprophet> from . import views
[01:15:34] <theprophet> urlpatterns = [
[01:15:35] <theprophet>     path('', views.index, name='index'),
[01:15:35] <theprophet> ]
[01:15:54] <dang`r`us> the "point" is when django tries to determine the view to call from the URL a client/browser/user requested
[01:15:55] <theprophet> AnselmoCampanas yes  i know that
[01:16:14] <AnselmoCampanas> so in the general urls, you include each of the app's url under a specific path
[01:16:24] <theprophet> dang`r`us i see, and that point what include does is?
[01:16:31] <dang`r`us> yes, your path is '' here, so it's not obvious what this "include" business is doing. if your path were 'index/' it would be 'polls/index'
[01:16:47] <dang`r`us> theprophet, include is a tool for organization
[01:17:10] <dang`r`us> everything related to polls will be found under https://your-site/polls/...blah whatever...
[01:17:56] <theprophet> ok so if i have many urls, i use include
[01:18:02] <dang`r`us> basically
[01:18:19] <theprophet> and one more little question
[01:18:26] <theprophet> and i will be forever greatful
[01:18:45] <theprophet> i am broke, and i will get job and wont be homless to be honest. if i learn django
[01:19:13] <PaulWay[w]> Not sure if that's the question yet.
[01:19:20] <theprophet> so if include is chop opossite
[01:19:50] <theprophet> it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point
[01:21:09] <theprophet> to point when you said the "point" is the "point" is when django tries to determine the view to call from the URL a client/browser/user requested
[01:22:02] <AnselmoCampanas> theprophet, here there is an Spanish tutorial for the first steps to create an application
[01:22:06] <theprophet> i dont understand why its saying chop what is it choping?
[01:22:06] <AnselmoCampanas> https://docs.djangoproject.com/es/3.2/intro/tutorial01/
[01:22:32] <theprophet> i am not spanish :(

[01:23:03] <AnselmoCampanas> ups, sorry
[01:23:29] <theprophet> AnselmoCampanas can you tell me what is it choping? i got the rest
[01:23:36] <theprophet> i understand the rest of it
[01:23:51] <theprophet> why does the django doc say chop ?
[01:26:09] <PaulWay[w]> I've missed something - what docs are you talking about theprophet?
[01:26:19] <theprophet> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/urls/#including-other-urlconfs
[01:26:43] *** Quits: Steve-Dusty (~Steve-Dus@user/steve-dusty) (Quit: Client closed)
[01:26:46] <AnselmoCampanas> it means that the main urls.py will pass the remaining of the matching url to the includes urls.py
[01:26:57] <PaulWay[w]> 'chops off' - removes, truncates, deletes, erases.
[01:27:15] <AnselmoCampanas> if the requested URL is http://localhost:8000/polls/2/
[01:27:16] <theprophet> yes i know what chops off mean i know translation
[01:27:27] <PaulWay[w]> Then I don't understand why that's confusing you.
[01:27:43] <theprophet> AnselmoCampanas ok then what?
[01:27:50] <AnselmoCampanas> the main urls.py that has something like path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
[01:28:47] <AnselmoCampanas> will get the http://localhost:8000/polls/2/ URL, will "cut" the "/2/" and will let to manage the "2/" url to the specific url files included in that sentence
[01:29:27] <AnselmoCampanas> so, anything matching with "http://localhost:8000/polls/" will be managed by polls.urls.py
[01:30:28] <AnselmoCampanas> and the urls defined by polls.urls.py are not aware of any part of the first part of the url ("http://localhost:8000/polls/"), but it will be aware of the rest of the request url

[01:34:50] <PaulWay[w]> If 'something' matches the URL pattern in `polls/urls.py`, yes.
[01:35:02] <theprophet> ok
[01:35:16] <AnselmoCampanas> you have to have something like: path('something/', aFunctionView), in polls.urls.py
[01:35:23] <theprophet> yes
[01:35:51] <theprophet> i need to calculate in my brain what you said to fully understand
[01:36:20] <PaulWay[w]> Or `path('<slug:str>', aFunctionView)`.
[01:36:43] <PaulWay[w]> I.e. a pattern which matches 'something'.
[01:37:50] <theprophet> i tought, that urlpattern list was like chain like polls/something/something/something/
[01:38:32] <AnselmoCampanas> does will not work at least you have:  path('something/something/something/', aFunctionView), in polls.urls.py
[01:39:12] <theprophet> i see now, thank you anselmo i will be forever greatful my friend. if you ever come to georgia, big feast is on me. KING FEAST.
[01:39:34] <PaulWay[w]> Sorry, btw, I got the arguments wrong above - it should be `path('<str:slug>', a_function_view)`
[01:39:48] <PaulWay[w]> Data type, colon, argument name.
[01:39:50] <theprophet> thank you PaulWay[w]
[01:40:24] <PaulWay[w]> That will match `something/something/something/` and put it into the argument 'slug' and pass that as an argument to a_function_view.
[01:40:50] <PaulWay[w]> So a_function_view would then need to be declared as `def a_function_view(request, slug)` or similar.

[17:27:23] <theprophet> please somebody help me with this, i copy this text from django docs and i dont know what is what in here.   The include() function allows referencing other URLconfs. Whenever Django encounters include(), it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.
[17:27:57] <theprophet> i know it is talking about this    - from django.contrib import admin
[17:27:57] <theprophet> from django.urls import include, path
[17:27:58] <theprophet> urlpatterns = [
[17:27:58] <theprophet>     path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
[17:27:59] <theprophet>     path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
[17:27:59] <theprophet> ]
[17:28:25] <theprophet> and i know the chops off means that  polls'/ will be removed.
[17:29:00] <theprophet> but my problem is , when it says whatever part of the url matched up, does it means in browser or in django ?
[17:29:39] <theprophet> what is meant by whatever part of URL?
[17:30:41] <theprophet> where its pointing out? what is meant by url? exactly what part? browser , in django or where?  does it mean this? -->  path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),

[18:00:20] <deepy> theprophet: what it means is that when you go to :8000/polls/hello then the polls/ will match your include('polls.urls') and the URLs defined in there will get the remainder, so your polls application will only get the hello
[18:01:47] <theprophet> deepy omg thank you, thats exactly what it is?
[18:02:19] <deepy> This is especially useful if you want the same application in multiple places or if you want it in a different place, like I'm Swedish and might want it to be on /omrostningar/
[18:02:43] <deepy> or maybe my manager is allergic to long urls and will fire me if it's not at /p/ instead of /polls/
[18:03:50] <deepy> theprophet: yup, it's there to make it easier, if your polls.url had to be aware of everything then the configuration would quickly get messy :-)
[18:04:19] <theprophet> deepy wow thank you my friend.
[18:05:26] <theprophet> deepy one small question tho.
[18:06:20] <theprophet> so to be 100% sure
[18:06:30] <theprophet> when i type :8000/polls/hello
[18:06:39] <theprophet> hello gets triggered
[18:06:44] <theprophet> but not polls same time
[18:06:49] <theprophet> thats include?
[18:07:04] <theprophet> is that correct?
[18:07:11] <theprophet> deepy
[18:10:16] <pycode1> does anyone have ever used splitarrayfield ?
[18:10:31] <pycode1> i have an arrayfield i need to create more than one input to add to that array
[18:10:41] <pycode1> but i have read the source code and i must pass the size parameter
[18:10:56] <pycode1> i do not know the size bacause  i will add more elements from JS
[18:12:37] <deepy> theprophet: your application will only see the part after the path, so if you do path('my/cool/polls/hello', then your application will still think it's just /hello
[18:12:40] *** Joins: pro_z (~pro_z@37.214.49.15)
[18:13:22] <deepy> err sorry, path('my/cool/polls', and then go to :8000/my/cool/polls/hello
[18:14:02] <theprophet> deepy thank you so much.
[18:14:21] <deepy> theprophet: the idea is that when you write your application you shouldn't need to worry about how the user gets there
[18:15:13] <theprophet> deepy i see. thank you.
[18:16:07] <theprophet> deepy i want to practice this now, so i can see it with my eyes. but i am not sure how.
[18:16:24] <deepy> write some urls, try using different paths
[18:16:39] <deepy> be radical and write a second application and include that application in your first and see what happens :'D
[18:17:06] <theprophet> ok :D

[22:04:15] <stdout> this is using PIL, pdf2image and numpy. https://paste.centos.org/view/9b14565c numpy is used for lines 9 through 19. i'm hoping someone can help me accomplish the same without numpy since it doesn't play well in python venv's and this is running in mod_wsgi. any help or pointers is appreciated.

[22:08:49] <stdout> meh... just google "numpy mod_wsgi"
[22:09:42] <Wooble> so a bunch of people don't know how to point their crappy apache plugin to the right venv and that means numpy doesn't work in venvs generally?
[22:10:32] <stdout> i pointed mine correctly and it still hung when trying to do the function that referenced numpy
[22:10:52] <stdout> that's why i looked it up in the first place
[22:11:04] <nedbat> stdout: "numpy doesn't work well with venvs" is just misleading
[22:11:32] <stdout> that wasn't my intention, just my understanding.
[22:11:39] <Wooble> "numpy doesnt work well with mod_wsgi unless you add WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}" maybe less misleading?
[22:12:16] <stdout> but WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL} makes mod_wsgi use the global python environment of the OS and not the specific venv right?
[22:12:57] <Wooble> stdout: no, it just makes it use the interpreter mod_wsgi spun up initially; that can still come from a venv
[22:14:31] <ProtonBit> hello
[22:15:24] <ProtonBit> has any worked with using the asgi support in django?
[22:16:07] <stdout> Wooble, so, would I still use the same WSGIDaemonProcess string?
[22:16:36] <stdout> the same that I used to point at my venv
[22:16:41] <Wooble> stdout: yes.
[22:17:35] <Wooble> stdout: anyway to answer your initial question, I don't think there's any good way to get data back into a PIL image without a numpy array...
[22:17:49] <stdout> thanks
[22:17:56] <stdout> i had tried that. don't remember the error off the top of my head. let me change over to that config and i'll post errors.
[22:18:06] <stdout> i must be missing something somewhere.

[22:19:46] <theprophet> Wooble can you please deconstruct this part for me? from django docs, Whenever Django encounters include(), it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point
[22:20:11] <theprophet> i dont understand what part of url they are talking about.
[22:20:31] <theprophet> which url they have in mind saying that?
[22:20:48] *** Joins: MrGlass (~mrglass@user/mrglass)
[22:20:53] <ironbeard> Is there a way to specify to_field_name on a ModelForm if I'm using the `fields = ['field1', 'field2']` setting in Meta to specify which fields (i.e., as opposed to defining the fields outside of Meta)
[22:21:45] <Wooble> theprophet: the URL sent in the actual request you're currently handling.
[22:22:09] <ProtonBit> does anyone know how I implement the async def on the call method for an class based view?
[22:22:12] <theprophet> Wooble the one in the main project url or my app url?
[22:22:55] <Wooble> theprophet: any given request it to a single unique URL. whatever the user typed into the address bar or got to through a link. that's the URL being matched against your url handlers
[22:23:17] <Wooble> s/it to/is to/
[22:23:37] <theprophet> Wooble ok i got that, so from that, what part is chopped off there?
[22:24:08] <theprophet> i understand the url is this http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/
[22:24:21] <MrGlass> Does anyone have experience using parallel tests & coverage? I've followed a few guides and im at a point where tests run and coverage files are made, but coverage report says there is no data
[22:24:23] <carlio> If your url looks like '/polls/votes/blah' and the urls.py in the main has `'polls/', include('polls.urls')`' then it chops of "polls/" and passes "votes/blah" to the polls.urls patterns, and they match from there.
[22:24:45] <stdout> soooo... i think it's working using my venv. is there something similar to a php info page i can use to confirm that django is running from my venv?
[22:25:27] <nedbat> MrGlass: are you using coverage directly, or with pytest-cov?
[22:25:45] <carlio> stdout : if you have DEBUG=True, you can just go to "/lala-does-not-exist" and it'll dump the environment variables in the error message, which would include things like the path to the code running, bit of a hacky way but it'd work I guess
[22:26:07] <stdout> carlio, that'll work. thanks
[22:26:26] <theprophet> carlio my url is just 8000:/polls/
[22:27:36] <stdout> carlio, that's not giving me a full dump page, just a 404 and some info about my urls.py file
[22:27:42] <theprophet> '/polls/votes/blah' what you by this vote? second url in polls/ url. py?
[22:28:00] <theprophet> carlio
[22:28:08] <theprophet> what do you mean*
[22:28:09] <carlio> stdout: yeah sorry I realised after I typed it, you need something that torws an exception to get the environment variables sorry!
[22:29:25] <carlio> theprophet: think of it like a heirarchy : "http://localhost:8000/polls/_something_else" is handled first by the browser, which decides where "http://localhost:8000/" should go. Then, the main Django application (urls.py, the one next to your settings.py) decides where to send "polls/_anything_after"
[22:30:00] <carlio> so "polls/lalala" and "polls/popsicle" and "polls" are all given to the polls/urls.py
[22:30:14] <carlio> except with "polls" removed - the main urls.py has consumed that, as it were
[22:30:19] <theprophet> carlio yes i understand that part.
[22:30:23] <carlio> ah sorry
[22:30:50] <theprophet> but why does it remove(chop off) the name part in this path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
[22:30:56] <theprophet> carlio
[22:31:25] <carlio> that's the bit I meant by "consumes", for URL matching, the "polls/" part was already taken
[22:32:51] <theprophet> but if its consumed, how am i still able to go to this link 8000:/polls/   ? carlio
[22:33:19] <Wooble> theprophet: polls.urls.py will get "/" there, and do the appropriate thing.
[22:33:30] <Wooble> (probably call an index() function or something.)
[22:34:08] <Wooble> err... polls/urls.py, obviously.
[22:34:21] <theprophet> path('', views.index, name='index'), like this?
[22:34:35] <Wooble> right.
[22:34:45] <theprophet> so its not choping of anything ffs
[22:34:51] <theprophet> off*
[22:35:20] <carlio> the main urls.py is giving what's left to the pattern matching in polls/urls.py ; that's what it means by chopping off (or consuming)
[22:35:23] <Wooble> theprophet: it's chopping off "polls/" before handing off to the polls handler, so polls/urls.py doesn't need to know about the polls/ part
[22:37:10] <theprophet> carlio ok so even if i have this written path('polls/', include('polls.urls')), as you see "polls/" is there , its still considered as chopped off?
[22:37:33] <theprophet> Wooble right...
[22:38:24] <carlio> polls/urls.py does not see "polls/" when it does its pattern matching, it's not there as far as it is concerned.
[22:38:44] <theprophet> carlio yes i get it now, FINALLY
[22:39:53] <theprophet> whatever part of the URL matched up to that point
[22:40:01] <theprophet> means before include
[22:40:18] <theprophet> so everything before include is meant by this part in django docs
[22:40:48] <carlio> yep
[22:41:13] <theprophet> all other included urls right? carlio
[22:41:37] <carlio> it basically says "anything after the polls/ part of the URL, polls.urls you handle that please"
[22:43:33] <theprophet> carlio Wooble jfc guys, thank you, for 2 days ive been struggling with this 24 hour non stop. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFIENG THIS FOR ME !!!
[22:43:47] <carlio> yw
[22:44:11] <Wooble> theprophet: do you have an actual app you're having trouble with? if not, I'd suggest not studying the docs too much.
[22:44:33] <theprophet> Wooble yes i do.
[22:45:31] <theprophet> Wooble whatever part of the URL matched up to that point <-- this is the part that confused me most, ,, now i realize that , whatever part URL is the any url before django sees the include()
[22:45:51] <theprophet> now its all clear to me.
