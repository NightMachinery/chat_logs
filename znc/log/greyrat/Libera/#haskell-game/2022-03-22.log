[06:33:54] <abastro[m]> > <@f-a:libera.chat> 136 replies to «I feel Haskell is dying», has to be a record
[06:33:54] <abastro[m]>  * I am sorry for that. I did not know if it was a regularly visited topic, or it would be such a lengthy topic.
[06:33:58] <abastro[m]>  * I am sorry for that. I did not know if it was a regularly revisited topic, or it would be such a lengthy topic.
[06:35:17] <abastro[m]>  * I am sorry for that. I did not know if it was a regularly revisited topic, or it would be such a lengthy topic.  Supposed to be a small rant with call for clarification to clear up my doubts, but it exploded..
[06:39:48] <sm> did you start it abastro ?
[06:40:00] <abastro[m]> I'm sorry again..
[06:40:13] <abastro[m]> * sorry again.. yes I started it
[06:40:16] <sm> aha! :)
[06:40:54] <sm> nothing wrong with the topic. I just read the thread. It seemed some people got frustrated at (among other things) your constant gloomy replies 
[06:41:15] <sm> the other things were .. not you :)
[06:41:27] <sm> good discussion though
[06:41:37] <abastro[m]> Yea, I should have not had so many gloomy replies
[06:42:24] <abastro[m]> Rants are not healthy, but I somehow.. did it. Sorry about that.
[06:42:42] <abastro[m]> For an upside, I can now see that haskell is going great!
[06:43:10] <sm> it wasn't a rant.. we'd recognise a rant :)
[06:43:32] <sm> parts are.. there's always lots of room for improvement
[06:44:10] <sm> have you invested much time in haskell so far ?
[06:45:09] <abastro[m]> I think I am not solely invested in haskell, so it would be about 4 years of haskell experience with lots of holes in between. To be honest, I am not a CS major either.
[06:46:00] <abastro[m]> Btw by rant, I mean:
[06:46:00] <abastro[m]> > Hm. Last I checked, Clojure, F#, and Common Lisp are all becoming out of fashion - while stuffs like Go, Python and JS are getting more and more traction. Could be me though.
[06:46:57] <abastro[m]>  * Btw by rant, I mean:
[06:46:57] <abastro[m]> > Hm. Last I checked, Clojure, F#, and Common Lisp are all becoming out of fashion - while stuffs like Go, Python and JS are getting more and more traction. Could be me though.
[06:46:57] <abastro[m]> So I was more worried about FP. But ya I don't think langs like Go would go afloat high with its current state.

[06:48:24] <sm> that's not a RANT
[06:49:10] <sm> most haskellers aren't CS majors I'd guess
[06:49:28] <sm> well, I wonder
[06:49:53] <sm> have you been able to build much useful stuff in haskell ?
[06:49:55] <abastro[m]> Yep, I think. IIRC CS majors typically learn imperative programming first.
[06:50:29] <abastro[m]> No, I am not inclined to building useful stuffs - mostly because I am (for now) a hobbyist programmer
[06:50:48] <abastro[m]> * am not currently inclined to
[06:51:00] <sm> just learning it for fun ?
[06:51:36] <sm> well that sounds useful
[06:51:45] <abastro[m]> Yep, for fun and my personal automation tasks.
[06:52:05] <abastro[m]> Oh, I use xmonad for my laptop, it is simple and fancy!
[06:52:12] <abastro[m]> * and fancy! So that is a use.
[06:52:18] <sm> I think once you've been productive with it, you start to value it as a tool for thought/personal productivity, whether it takes over the world or not
[06:53:00] <abastro[m]> I see! Thank you for a great answer
[06:53:31] <sm> btw it wasn't mentioned in the thread but haskell is often a favourite choice in banking, finance, cryptocurrency applications
[06:53:48] <sm> eg it powers the very well regarded cardano
[06:54:30] <sm> it processes millions of facebook spam checks per second, etc. Maybe you have seen the lists of industrial users (incomplete as they may be)
[06:54:34] <abastro[m]> Interesting! I guess with its niche alive, I don't need to worry about death
[06:54:48] <abastro[m]> * worry about its death
[06:55:22] <sm> no, not death. It has achieved immortality. How much bigger it gets / how long it stays hot is the only question
[06:55:55] <abastro[m]> Right. Unless I am looking for a job, of course
[06:56:17] <abastro[m]> Thankfully I am not currently looking for a programming job.
[06:57:22] <sm> I think if you wanted a haskell job you could get one now
[06:57:22] <abastro[m]> Now I wonder why I was so worried. Thank you, sm, again for reassuring!
[06:57:46] <sm> check the frequent recruiting posts on /r/haskell these days
[06:59:09] <abastro[m]> Honestly, sometimes it surprises me how many recruiting posts there are compared to typical posts.
[07:00:15] <sm> they have been increasing steadily
[07:00:31] <sm> the cryptocurrency/finance boom is part of it
[07:00:52] <sm> but not all

[14:00:45] <f-a> abastro[m]: haha no worries, I am just amused by the amount of replies. Some could say it is a touchy subject
[14:03:15] <abastro[m]> Oh, thank you, I still think I should have avoided negative comments there. Discourse is not a platform for venting yet I ended up venting. Sorry for that, and I now think haskell is going good enough!
[14:05:40] <f-a> venting *is* good, it is much better than some of the alternatives, like putting the head in the sand. The thread had good suggestions
[14:05:55] <f-a> (also it might have drawn some attentions to Haskell Discousrse, which is always good)
[14:13:03] <abastro[m]> Thank you for putting it in good terms! And at least I am not going to make similar threads of complaining.  (I do find out that some ppl like to complain, I should avoid such behavior)
[14:14:42] <ManofLetters[m]> it seems you stroke a vibe; must be scary experience when you summon a monster and then it gets out of control ;D

[22:26:50] <marijan> Hey, anyone using haskell.nix and having GLFW-b as a dependency? Unfortunately GLFW-b is not pulled from a nix binary cache and built from source. The build of the dependency "bindings-GFLW" fails due to a missing X11 header file. I would like to add the missing xorb.libXext as a native build input, but I'm unsure how to achieve this. Any ideas?
[22:28:04] <ManofLetters[m]> no clue, perhaps some nix or haskell-need room would know or Haskell Gamedev discord

[22:58:23] <f-a> thanks
[23:29:57] <f-a> what is the most sensible structure to represent a Gamebook (those «choose your own adventure» type of games)? A tree? a graph?
[23:30:51] <ManofLetters[m]> it can loop, right? or only be a DAG?
[23:31:25] <f-a> yeah it can loop
[23:44:35] <ManofLetters[m]> then graph
[23:44:52] <ManofLetters[m]> or a tree and your walk over the tree is a graph
[23:45:10] <ManofLetters[m]> and then some jumps are special, because they are backward
[23:45:25] <ManofLetters[m]> up the tree
[23:45:40] <ManofLetters[m]> but that's probably not a useful distinction in your game?
[23:48:30] <f-a> mhhh I do not think I have backward jumps
[23:56:12] <ManofLetters[m]> if it can loop, then if you represent is as a tree, you have to have jumps up the tree
