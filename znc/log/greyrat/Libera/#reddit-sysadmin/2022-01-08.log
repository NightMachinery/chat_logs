[00:10:23] <ny0x> our spf record has too many dns lookups
[00:10:25] <ny0x> how do I fix
[00:10:43] <int0x1C8> specify ip not domain where possible?
[00:11:15] <ny0x> most of the lookups are nested from vendors.
[00:11:20] <ny0x> netsuite has 4 lookups wtf
[00:11:55] <int0x1C8> how many entries are there in your record?
[00:12:26] <int0x1C8> or just blame the vendors

[01:57:59] <mistiry> if its that big of a deal
[01:58:13] <int0x1C8> I only use vi when forced to
[01:58:30] <mistiry> and i only use anything but vim when forced to
[01:58:41] <int0x1C8> like running "viconfig" on the pfsense to change https to http so I can get back into the web GUI that my coworker locked us out of
[01:59:13] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> I use it a lot. Def my go to text editor unless I‚Äôm in a gui and have vscode
[01:59:18] <mistiry> yep
[01:59:21] <mistiry> vim or vscode
[01:59:26] <mistiry> 99.9% of the time
[02:00:37] <mistiry> int0x1C8: here is why vim would be nice for that. say you had to replace that https with http in 200 places. ez in vi to slap down a regex and replace it all. 
[02:00:46] <mistiry> i mean, you could do it outside an editor entirely and just sed replace it
[02:00:48] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> I‚Äôm still bad at remembering the binds for fancy stuff but the basic stuff is pretty easy once you play around for a while. I also really like the ability to like execute shell commands within vim against the current file.
[02:01:31] <mistiry> or say you only wanted to replace https with http in part of the file. you can easily in vim pick a block of lines and execute the regex only against that
[02:01:39] <int0x1C8> except I just needed to remove a single character in a single file, so fuck off with that shit
[02:01:40] <mistiry> and many, many more powerful things you can do
[02:01:56] <mistiry> yes, which is also super simple to do 
[02:01:57] <int0x1C8> if I need to do more with text I'll script it
[02:02:38] <mistiry> do '/https' to find it. cursor to the 's'. hit x. save and quit. or faster, :%s/https/http/g and then save and quit. dont even have to find it in the file.
[02:03:15] <mistiry> or like i said, dont even open an editor and just use sed on the file
[02:03:17] <int0x1C8> well whatever already did it, now I have to stop it from endlessly redirecting http to https
[02:03:47] <mistiry> or better, fix https so it works
[02:03:52] <mistiry> instead of forcing it to http

[02:05:53] <mistiry> uhh version number sort? i dont really use that

[02:06:20] <mistiry> nice. that makes sense

[02:06:37] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> And I hate unsorted lists or like when IP sorts are stupid
[02:06:41] <mistiry> yep
[02:07:11] <mistiry> but yeah, calling external command directly is very nice 
[02:09:20] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> Yeah it‚Äôs pretty great. Sometimes I just open vim so I can copy paste lists of IP addresses into vim, sort, then copy back out
[02:10:09] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> Because like during reporting each finding will have affected IPs, so it‚Äôs just a faster workflow when I‚Äôm being anal about sorting lol

[02:22:54] <catbeard> herp
[02:22:56] <catbeard> pf ftw
[02:27:32] <int0x1C8> so who here has a vlan'd open public wifi network and how do you prevent them from being able to access the management interface of the router (in this case pfsense) ?
[02:27:49] <int0x1C8> because that's what started all this
[02:28:12] <catbeard> whitelist the ip on the lan interface
[02:28:58] <int0x1C8> on samsung phones under wifi connections there's a "Manage router" link, and my boss noticed that if you press that while connected to our guest network, it brings you to the web gui for login
[02:30:25] *** Joins: arlion (~arlion@user/arlion)
[02:30:45] <int0x1C8> to me it should be as simple as adding the guest wifi subnet to a deny ACL for access to the GUI interface
[02:31:30] <int0x1C8> fuckit I'll deal with it next week

[02:42:12] <CoJaBo> Huh, so this is weird. ARP or something is broken somehow. Usually I'd start with trying to arping the router, but arping isn't installed, and I can't install it because my internet is out because ARP is broken. Wtf.

[22:57:33] <CableNinja> got a new mouse yesterday... first 'real' gaming mouse I've had.. has configurable weights and shit... which cool, whatever, you can customize the feel, but then the mouses software detects which weights are where.. I dont know why.. but it blows my fucking mind
[22:57:53] <CableNinja> I kinda wanna send one of these to BigCliveDotCom and have him take it apart to see what he thinks lol
[22:59:06] <Casteil> damnit, can't remember the name of the tool I'd looked into for automating setup of linux deployments
[22:59:20] <CableNinja> fog? ansible? chef?

[22:59:30] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> Puppet
[22:59:35] <Casteil> ansible, bingo... thanks guys :P
[23:01:10] <CableNinja> also regarding the mouse... I'm thoroughly convinced that no mouse manufacturer has any idea what a hand actually looks like, or how people rest hands on their mice... either that or I have really fucked up hands
[23:07:46] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> Send hand pics and we'll tell you.
[23:08:01] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> And maybe wank to them too
[23:08:31] <CableNinja> please subscribe to my onlyhands
[23:09:32] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> You don't have lobster claw hands, right?
[23:09:37] <CableNinja> lol
[23:11:30] <CableNinja> idk what it is about these mice, I tried a few different ones at the store, and they all had issues on way or another... the one I bought, the 3rd thumb button requires that I actually shift my entire hand forward to hit it. and then theres 2 buttons behind the mouse wheel, as if peoples fingertipss can touch all the way to the originating knuckle
[23:14:13] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> The mouse wheel buttons are for adjusting dpi, which isn't something you usually do. I do agree with the thumb buttons though.
[23:14:59] <CableNinja> the wheel buttons on this one change between profiles. but yeah, not something done often, but it bothers me on the placement
[23:15:07] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> I usually map them to back/undo and forward/redo. Maybe a 3rd one for tab complete or something.
[23:15:39] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> But why would I have my hand on the mouse while typing...
[23:15:42] <CableNinja> do mouse designers have like monster long thumbs? is my thumb short? does no one know what a hands proportions are generally?
[23:16:11] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> Or tiny hands
[23:16:15] <CableNinja> yeah I never have my hand on the mouse while typing. 
[23:16:25] <sd> 11<H‚Äãotmess> Had to use a cheap mouse over a razor
[23:17:54] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> I rather have a fancy keyboard over a fancy mouse. Still using some random HP mouse from a decade ago.
[23:18:52] <CableNinja> I dont have a measuring tape near by... with my hand on a standard keyboard from the left side (keyboard 'vertical'), base of palm at the edge of the keyboard. my middle finger reaches I, my thumbs reach about 1/2" over the space bar, pointer finger reaches J
[23:19:32] <CableNinja> I'd say I have 'average' hands? lol
