[01:41:53] <shibboleth> i remember visiting berlin long ago. one of the locals got shitfaced and i had an early start the next day, i got him to the nearest bahnhof. in retrospect, sure, it may have looked like that, but the number of times various groups of "skinheads"/etc yelled out "schwoli" along the route was... not less than ten
[01:42:28] <shibboleth> ofc, i didn't know what it meant, so...
[01:42:39] <rpifan> you mean schwul?
[01:42:57] <signofzeta> I know what "schwula" means.  Is that the same word?  (I don't speak German or know tenses.)

[03:03:20] <sd> 06<P​hasey> Its pretty interesting actually I will do more research on my own time regarding it
[03:03:20] <signalblue> I remember being on the Discord server BEFORE the IRC bridge
[03:03:33] <signalblue> without all the bots all over the place
[03:03:39] <sd> 06<P​hasey> you were a peasant like me at one point?
[03:03:48] <signalblue> No.
[03:03:54] <signalblue> I used IRC at that point as well
[03:04:05] <signalblue> but this channel and Discord were not connected
[03:04:32] <sd> 06<P​hasey> When i first joined the server
[03:04:42] <sd> 06<P​hasey> i was so fucking confused why bots were talking to each other
[03:04:43] <mistiry> this channel predates the existence of discord itself by like 5 years lol
[03:04:46] <signofzeta> We're just glad to have you.  Like I said, Discord is my mobile solution to IRC.
[03:04:49] <sd> 06<P​hasey> I genuinely thought it was some AI shit
[03:04:49] <sd> 06<P​hasey> lol
[03:05:11] <signalblue> mistiry that would be like 2010 ish
[03:05:18] <mistiry> that would be correct
[03:05:18] <signalblue> also LOL
[03:05:24] <sd> 06<P​hasey> it was kinda intimidating
[03:05:37] <sd> 06<P​hasey> then I realized for some reason you guys were actual humans
[03:05:44] <catbeard> wait what
[03:05:48] <signalblue> @Phasey IRC was developed in 1988
[03:05:52] <catbeard> who told you that
[03:05:52] <signalblue> if you didn't know
[03:05:58] <sd> 06<P​hasey> and then today I learned you guys are talking through a old ass communication
[03:06:00] <sd> 06<P​hasey> holy shit
[03:06:02] <sd> 06<P​hasey> way before my time
[03:06:04] <sd> 06<P​hasey> LMAO
[03:06:06] <signalblue> old protocol*
[03:06:13] <sd> 06<P​hasey> does it still get updated
[03:06:18] <signalblue> you were 8 when discord came out
[03:06:18] <catbeard> no
[03:06:20] <xe0n> errr we were u sing irc before you were a thought
[03:06:20] <xe0n> lol
[03:06:24] <xe0n> using*
[03:06:29] <signalblue> and yes it still gets updated
[03:06:35] <mistiry> IRC servers and clients do yes
[03:06:36] <signalblue> IRCv3 is around the corner
[03:06:39] <catbeard> i was using IRC when your grandfather was in die-a-pers
[03:06:45] <mistiry> the protocol not so much, though IRCv3 is "being worked on"
[03:06:49] <signalblue> but the protocol is just like a protocol
[03:06:57] <signofzeta> Yes, @Phasey, IRCv3 is long since out.  IRCv3.2 is done.  There's still more to do.
[03:07:04] <signalblue> just like RDP/SSH/VNC/SMTP/HTTP/DNS and what not
[03:07:07] <signofzeta> We won't get multimedia or anything, but we're still here.
[03:07:12] <signalblue> we don't need that
[03:07:15] <signalblue> we can post links
[03:07:18] <xe0n> we get ascii

[03:18:54] <catbeard> but worth a try
[03:19:34] <shibboleth> also, on the topic of mail clients. thunderbird is a bit top-heavy with constant sec issues due to being a wrapper on top of firefox
[03:19:59] <shibboleth> is there a simple-as-dirt- portable email client that can do pop and imap anyone'd care to recommend
[03:20:14] <signofzeta> You're not wrong, shibboleth, but if you're talking about the latest STARTTLS issues, those affected a lot of clients and servers.

[03:21:33] <signofzeta> Also, shibboleth:  ActiveSync/MAPI is still provided by a plugin.  I agree it should get baked in.
[03:22:36] <shibboleth> well, it's also several hundreds of megs, umpteen and ever changing "advanced" settings for security/privacy

[03:23:25] <shibboleth> surely there is a... keep-it-simple-stupid dumb-as-rocks basic pop/imap to mbox/etc foss client?
[03:23:41] <signofzeta> I've used Exchange Online via IMAP, and for my rare uses on Linux, it was functional.  You're not wrong, though.  MAPI should be baked in.  It's certainly easier than the old RPC-HTTPS!

[03:23:58] <shibboleth> mutt
[03:24:05] <signofzeta> Well, not Windows Mail, if you want mbox.
[03:24:15] <shibboleth> as for mapi, i suspect licensing issues
[03:24:19] <signofzeta> Claws-Mail?
[03:24:28] <signofzeta> Oh yeah, licensing might be a factor.
[03:24:55] <shibboleth> msft licensed out activesync for ios, droid integration and there are now feature-parity foss implementations
[03:25:16] <shibboleth> but mapi? iirc gnome evolution can do mapil, but then we're talking overkill/bloatware
[03:25:39] *** Joins: Joe-Developer (~Joe-Devel@user/joe-developer)
[03:25:43] <signofzeta> and don't forget, MAPI-HTTPS is the new default, but it's off by default on older-but-still-current versions of Exchange Server.

[07:31:27] <Hunterkll> @nakade yea, but you get 750 hours for 1 linux and 1 windows

[07:31:53] <sd> 10<n​akade> @Hunterkll yeah, practically same deal as AWS.. block of hours, you can eat it with 1 VM or eat it faster with multiple VMs etc etc.
[07:32:09] <sd> 10<n​akade> i think we're all on the same page there anyway
[07:32:09] <sd> 10<n​akade> bottom line

[07:32:15] <sd> 10<n​akade> its your lab
[07:32:22] <Hunterkll> ah yea
[07:32:26] <Hunterkll> it is that way
[07:32:27] <Hunterkll> You can create multiple instances of services for free if your total usage is within the usage limit. For example, you get 750 hours of a B1S Windows virtual machine free each month with your Azure free account. Use 750 hours in any combination you want. You can create 5 B1S Windows virtual machines and use them for 150 hours each.
[07:32:39] <Hunterkll> but 
[07:32:45] <Hunterkll> the question is
[07:32:46] <sd> 10<n​akade> get comfortable, once you've figured the tech out, how to admin, etc., you can then figure out billing & other things and get more comfortable with sizing & spec'ing a game server
[07:32:46] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> still says I have 100 usd total credit
[07:32:48] <Hunterkll> is there two pools of hours?
[07:32:55] <sd> 10<n​akade> single pool
[07:32:55] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> even though I been using those machines for a couple hours
[07:32:56] <Hunterkll> one for linux, one for windows 
[07:33:04] <Hunterkll> b/c the free tier page lists winodws and linux separaately
[07:33:07] <sd> 10<n​akade> oh, yeah, one for B1 linux, one for B1 windows
[07:33:29] <sd> 10<n​akade> but that's it.. so if you run 3x B1s for 3 hours each.. that's 9 hours out of your 750 hr bucket
[07:33:33] <Hunterkll> yea thats what i was talking about 
[07:33:42] <Hunterkll> so you can run 1 windows and 1 linux 24/7 
[07:33:46] <Hunterkll> which is what i meant by two vms 
[07:33:48] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> where do i see how much I tapped into that 750 hours
[07:33:49] <Hunterkll> at least, thats what it looks like
[07:33:52] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> and I dont think its per month
[07:33:54] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> only the first month
[07:33:57] <Hunterkll> no
[07:33:59] <Hunterkll> it's 12 months
[07:34:03] <Hunterkll> the documentation literally says that
[07:34:04] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[07:34:08] <AnonymooseReddtr> R T F M
[07:34:10] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> but it says I can renew it every year?
[07:34:10] <Hunterkll> so does the site i linked 
[07:34:17] <Hunterkll> you have a student account 
[07:34:18] <Hunterkll> which is different
[07:34:19] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> so i essentially have 12 month vm?
[07:34:21] <Hunterkll> we are not talking about that
[07:34:24] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> ohhhh
[07:34:39] <Hunterkll> also, your usage against your credit (if it hits that) might not show up till tomorrow or shit
[07:34:41] <sd> 10<n​akade> @therottenapple best guess.. subscriptions.. i dont know, the azure accounts i have all have paid agreements so I haven't seen what a free tier looks like in forever
[07:34:43] <Hunterkll> its not instant updating
[07:35:03] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> lmao wait until it says I have like 50 bucks left
[07:35:05] <Hunterkll> @nakade and he doesn't have a front-customer facing free tier account, he has an education account 
[07:35:18] <sd> 10<n​akade> exactly, i have no idea whats in that then
[07:35:20] <Hunterkll> which is a different set of benefits all together
[07:35:27] <sd> 10<n​akade> but being education, gonna be a point of contact that can check
[07:35:52] <Hunterkll> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-students-faq/
[07:35:56] <Hunterkll> or you can just RTFM
[07:36:45] <AnonymooseReddtr> Setup auto shutdown on your vm's 
[07:36:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> setup cost alerts and budets
[07:36:51] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> I have that ^^
[07:36:52] <AnonymooseReddtr> you'll be fine
[07:36:55] <Hunterkll> Subscriptions provide access to Azure products. Azure for Students gives you 100 USD credit for 12 months and access to more than 25 free products, including compute, network, storage, and databases. Any charges incurred during this period are deducted from the credit. To continue using Azure at the end of 12 months or after you've exhausted your 100 USD credit, whichever occurs first, you must upgrade to a 
[07:36:55] <Hunterkll> Pay-As-You-Go subscription by contacting Azure Support. After you provide a valid credit card, you remove the spending limit on the subscription and get access to the free products as part of your upgraded account.
[07:36:55] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> good suggestion
[07:37:10] <Hunterkll> seems like it's just extra $100/mo credit on top of the regular free tier 
[07:37:12] <sd> 10<n​akade> that's nice, they've put in breaks to ensure you dont bankrupt yourself
[07:37:21] <sd> 10<n​akade> in that respect Azure is better than AWS
[07:37:26] <Hunterkll> bah!
[07:37:39] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> aws requires credit card?
[07:37:41] <Hunterkll> I pointed a VM at my credit sub and it ran over and my pay-g side took over
[07:37:41] <Hunterkll> lol
[07:37:52] <sd> 10<n​akade> what, you don't learn until you provision your first x1.32xlarge? 😄
[07:37:54] <Hunterkll> ended up owing like $80 on a GPU compute VM i forgot to delete
[07:37:54] <Hunterkll> :D
[07:38:22] <Hunterkll> but yes
[07:38:26] <Hunterkll> if you're using the B1S standard VM 
[07:38:34] <Hunterkll> you do get the 750 hours / month free on student
[07:38:41] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> plus the 100 bucks
[07:38:42] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> thats a steal
[07:38:43] <Hunterkll> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/

[07:38:48] <Hunterkll> ^ all listed there
[07:39:02] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> I know github allows students to host websites too
[07:39:13] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> but the experience for setting up tls and a domain is probably worthwhile
[07:40:11] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> looks like I can only have 4 virtual vpus
[07:40:39] <Hunterkll> you need to use the B1S VM configuration 
[07:40:46] <Hunterkll> https://azurelessons.com/how-to-host-a-website-on-azure/
[07:40:47] <Hunterkll> ^ 
[07:40:57] <Hunterkll> you can also just host your site on azure free instead of running a stupid webserver
[07:41:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> you can get a free SSL Cert from letsencrypt
[07:41:10] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> or cloudflare I think
[07:41:30] <Hunterkll> cloudflare does SSL on the front end, you still need SSL on your side 
[07:41:34] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> you mean like selfhosted?
[07:41:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> If i were to setup a new site right now it would be setup using Azure DevOps, a CI/CD pipeline, GoHugo and azure static websites
[07:41:46] <Hunterkll> cloudflare will give you a certifiate they sign to put into your website but it's not a publicly trusted one
[07:41:52] <sd> 08<t​herottenapple> oh
[07:41:53] <Hunterkll> without that, your server -> cloudflare is unencrypted
[07:42:04] <Hunterkll> it's only cloudflare -> end user that sees the cloudflare pubclyl trusted SSL 
[07:42:16] <sd> 10<n​akade> Azure does free SSL certificates for most things I believe now
[07:42:28] <sd> 10<n​akade> so, yeah cloudflare's doable, but if you're going to learn Azure.. use what Azure has.
[07:42:29] <Hunterkll> so you still need a valid cert (the one cloudflare gives you, which is only good for you -> cloudflare, or a regular public trusted one) to encrypt you -> cloudflare 
[07:42:36] <Hunterkll> I mean
[07:42:40] <sd> 10<n​akade> then once you've learnt Azure, go branch out
[07:42:45] <Hunterkll> for a website i literally just linked the perfect tutorial :P

[17:09:54] <sd> 12<S​obia> There's not really a way to differentiate between "small needed programs" and "large malicious programs" with intune that I know of. It's either they can install things or not. The only option around this is probably with logon scripts or GPO. I don't think Intune has a built in whitelist of programs or anything.
[17:10:40] *** Joins: vinrock (~vinrock@user/vinrock)
[17:11:02] <sintax> You'd need SCCM to be able to build a software repo for users that would then allow them to install without admin creds. 
[17:11:08] <sintax> Or something simliar
[17:11:18] <sd> 12<S​obia> It may be more work for the IT team, but I always prefer the "no you can't install things" option. You could also grant admin account to very specific users who would help alleviate that work. Example users might be heads of departments. I would still require basic security training before granting them an admin account that they don't use to login and only use for authorization.
[17:12:25] <sd> 08<l​ennchanteur> But SCCM requires on Prem setup.
[17:12:25] <sd> 08<l​ennchanteur> We work remotely and thatsy migrated to the cloud AD
[17:13:20] <sd> 08<l​ennchanteur> We currently follow that system of making them fill up a form to grant the privileged access
[17:13:49] <sintax> Next best move then would be just probably setting up AD groups for software that will install for them over VPN being part of the group. 
[17:13:57] <sd> 08<l​ennchanteur> But, how can we consider that a good security practice? 🙁
[17:13:58] <sintax> You can't have that many people that need one off software for each person. 
[17:14:11] <sintax> Using ad groups for software?
[17:14:48] <sintax> That is best practice as far as I know. What you don't want is a cluster of different software and then trying to support it. 
[17:14:58] <sd> 08<l​ennchanteur> Azure AD groups for software ?
[17:15:12] <sintax> one second
[17:16:26] <sd> 12<S​obia> Honestly having trained IT personnel review the request and granting it is the most secure version of what you're asking for. However, it's not scaleable. Thus why, depending on your size, training some select staff who request admin creds and then not allowing the account to actually login to workstations and only authenticate is another option at that size. IF GPO and logon scripts aren't a possibility. I still prefer using GPO or logon scripting,
[17:16:27] <sd> 08<l​ennchanteur> Best thing would be to have a company portal where whitelisted softwares appear and users can download from that list, just like Software Center did for onprems

[18:17:40] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> need to install the openssh-client program
[18:17:43] <thegodsquirrel> I think it is all about how you use a mouse
[18:17:56] <Sousapro> I use a trackball for work lol
[18:18:09] <Sousapro> Maybe that's it 
[18:18:10] <thegodsquirrel> I try to use the proper posture and use my whole arm to move the mouse
[18:18:12] <JollyRgrs> thegodsquirrel: if that were the case, ppl would only get CT in one wrist
[18:18:33] <thegodsquirrel> ^^
[18:18:36] <thegodsquirrel> True
[18:19:02] <JollyRgrs> I think it is more of the angle (usually bending up) at the wrist and that strain while trying to move/manipulate with your fingers/palm while at that extreme angle
[18:19:06] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> cubital tunnel is pretty annoying too
[18:19:13] <JollyRgrs> wrist rests help you have a more parallel angle of attack
[18:19:17] <thegodsquirrel> But I think most CT is caused by improper mouse movement
[18:19:29] <JollyRgrs> so people use mouse with both wrists?
[18:19:35] <thegodsquirrel> No no
[18:19:50] <sd> 10<n​akade> @therottenapple website says 19c/hr or 29c/hr -> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-bastion/
[18:19:56] <JollyRgrs> so people normally only have single-sided CT?
[18:20:15] <thegodsquirrel> I believe it is cumulative a bulk of repetitive damage
[18:20:48] <JollyRgrs> yes, I view CT as a result of RSI
[18:21:17] <JollyRgrs> but again... mouse issues should not really affect anything with the non-mouse hand in this case
[18:21:21] <thegodsquirrel> And it hard for folks to make themselves change posture and how they do things
[18:21:39] <thegodsquirrel> Of course, I agree

[20:24:30] <PublicWiFi> csws: yeah a few
[20:24:46] <vinrock> nerds
[20:24:50] <csws> yeah so PublicWiFi the issue is that netbox 3 has secrets removed from the core. they were talking about implementing it as a plugin but no idea if that has happened
[20:25:20] <csws> the issue I had was I removed all my secrets and moved them to keepass but because the changelog still contained references, it freaked out

[20:40:51] <signofzeta> I just had to enable WPA1 on a network.  Life isn't fair.  At least I got the user's manager to make him reach out to the vendor for firmware updates.
[20:42:18] <Bru^> WPA1?
[20:42:20] <Bru^> is that even legal?
[20:42:24] <PublicWiFi> wtf?
[20:42:26] <Bru^> is this 1981?
[20:42:31] <PublicWiFi> WPA1 has been pwnd forever
[20:42:35] <PublicWiFi> why would you ever need that
[20:42:55] <ender> I've got an old ereader that only supports WPA1
[20:43:03] <signofzeta> Yeah, it makes me sad too.
[20:43:09] <ender> but it's useless for browsing the internet, so I don't bother at all
[20:43:19] <signofzeta> The user will ask the vendor for WPA3 support, so they'll probably wind up with WPA2, which will be good enough.
[20:43:49] <signofzeta> It might support WPA2+TKIP, but I don't feel like troubleshooting that hard.
[20:43:54] <signofzeta> Not unless I have to.
[20:44:10] <csws> response from the vendor: change it to an open network
[20:44:21] <signofzeta> It actually was an open network until yesterday
