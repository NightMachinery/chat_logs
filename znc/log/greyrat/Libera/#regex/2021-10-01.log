[07:04:47] <maroon> i cant read php, but 1 thing i do when a script doesnt work is insert an echo showing key info. like showing the arguments to a function, to make sure there really should match/branch, and if it should have matched/branched, to see exactly what the if() was
[07:05:15] <maroon> does your code have something for shuffling the deck?
[07:07:54] <jargon> No.
[07:08:04] <jargon> It just unshuffled prior.
[07:08:50] <jargon> For now I am just attempting to import all the QBasic data already used past.
[07:09:17] <jargon> Shuffling the deck doesn't make any sense in Roe.
[07:09:25] <jargon> Because it doesn't.
[07:09:43] <jargon> It wouldn't make any sense to shuffle cards.
[07:10:34] <maroon> you're kidding
[07:11:00] <maroon> isnt it sorta like the game of war, where the top cards compete against each other?
[07:11:48] <jargon> https://pastebin.com/B3bAT2k9
[07:12:30] <jargon> No, more like a cross between Chess and Gauntlet with an inventory of cards similar in connotation to Diablo.
[07:13:18] <maroon> so everyone starts with the same cards, and the strategy is when to use them?
[07:13:29] <jargon> It is a Dungeon Crawl.
[07:14:28] <jargon> Cards are arranged in a 3 layer 16x16 matrix, each with their own statistics per cell and sub-cards.

[07:21:22] <maroon> so there's 16*16*3=768 cards?
[07:27:12] <maroon> so if your regex is not matching something, insert a debugging echo before that line of code, then ask why a specific echoed string and echoed pattern don't make a regex match
[08:07:03] <jargon> maroon What did I do wrong? :< https://regex101.com/r/p2GBEW/1/
[08:07:53] <jargon> maroon, each cell can hold an additional 15 cards.
[08:12:51] <jargon> Roe is huge for how compact it is, and it runs, but doesn't compile, in QBasic.
[08:13:10] <jargon> Also the turns take seemingly forever to complete.
[08:16:13] <maroon> i added the /g flag so it's possible to have more than 1 match (cough), and then i took out a bunch of literal <enter> and replaced them with ^ https://regex101.com/r/p2GBEW/2
[08:20:20] <maroon> there's a flag for ignoring whitespace, but i dont think that allows you to include <enter> for readibility

[13:39:13] <maroon> to be clear, you want to match the word following the wird 'user'? and does it matter whether the following word is inside quotes?
[13:39:56] <maroon> is "bin" always going to be the 8th spaces-delimited token?

[19:28:54] <vhx> that's code from your script. what you need is >> JUST the regex pattern in the top box, your sample text to search in the big box
[19:29:10] <maroon> re101-quail-81, can you edit your regex to put a test string in the bottom box, which it should be matching?
[19:29:11] <vhx> looks like this is your pattern: (\d+?)\s
[19:29:28] <re101-quail-81> Yes, that is my pattern
[19:30:22] <maroon> your pattern can have \[(\d+)\]
[19:30:31] <vhx> what's your test string/data?
[19:30:50] <maroon> hopefully he's busy putting it in
[19:30:53] <re101-quail-81> An example of the string is this: "127 m².    -Vedi dettaglio"
[19:31:13] <maroon> re101-quail-81, please update your regex with your test string
[19:31:14] <re101-quail-81> And I would need only 127, but with my pattern I get [127]
[19:31:19] <re101-quail-81> Ok

[19:32:11] <maroon> next time you can click update instead of save
[19:32:23] <re101-quail-81> Oh sorry, first time using this tool
[19:32:39] <maroon> there are no square braces in your test string
[19:32:42] <vhx> do you have any sample text with the brackets taht are showing up? that just returns 127
[19:32:52] <re101-quail-81> I didn't explain myself
[19:33:11] <re101-quail-81> Regex will give me a result as I want, but it will give it between brackets...
[19:33:25] <re101-quail-81> So the result is 127, but the string that gets outputted is [127]
[19:33:33] <maroon> you did not give a regex which matches
[19:33:40] <vhx> what scripting/programming language are you using?
[19:33:44] <re101-quail-81> Pyhton
[19:34:30] <maroon> you say you are getting a match, but having the wrong match - you did not give a test string which gives a match, wrong or otherwise
[19:34:34] <vhx> i don't know anything about python...but if your input string has no square brackets, then it's something in your code that's adding those
[19:34:54] <re101-quail-81> No I'm sure it's regex
[19:34:58] <re101-quail-81> It didn't do it before
[19:35:07] <vhx> your input string has no brackets though
[19:35:27] <re101-quail-81> Yeah, that is because when regex gives an output, it places it inside the brackets
[19:35:31] <maroon> your test string is not even matching
[19:35:51] <vhx> that added output is coming from your regex engine, not your regex pattern

[19:36:17] <vhx> i have no idea, that's going to be however you're implementing regex in python

[19:37:23] <re101-quail-81> Mmm, it's so frustraing
[19:37:53] <maroon> add debugging echo immediately after the regex, is the square brace there already?
