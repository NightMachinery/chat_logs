[17:19:23] <jotham> hy
[17:19:25] <jotham> why
[17:19:38] <jotham> what's destroying african economies is european free trade deals
[17:19:45] <jotham> not some guy headbutting a few dollars of pasta
[17:20:02] <hinst> though I am not sure; maybe he cooks the pasta afterwards
[17:20:09] <jotham> it wont help
[17:20:16] <jotham> it's as dumb as saying recycling helps
[17:20:26] <jotham> macroeconomic forces are destroying countries
[17:20:31] <jotham> not a guy whacking his head into some pasta
[17:20:55] <jotham> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlPZ0Bev99s 
[17:21:03] <jotham> that's a pretty good DW doco on the problem
[17:21:07] <jotham> they have a few more
[17:27:52] <Renderwww> "art"
[17:28:57] <jotham> i learned in school art is literally just doing a mixture of craft and philosophy
[17:29:04] <jotham> if you miss either of them it's not art
[17:29:10] <jotham> but you also don't have to be good at either
[17:29:17] <jotham> i way prefer cool pictures and good music
[17:29:19] <jotham> to art
[17:29:30] <jotham> it's like how craft beers are obsessed with hops
[17:29:35] <jotham> doesn't seem like beer at that point anymore
[17:29:42] <jotham> just some subculture masturbation
[17:31:04] <Renderwww> not art: video games, art: headbutting pasta
[17:31:06] <Renderwww> it's simple
[17:32:24] <jotham> we do the same thing with programming culture
[17:32:36] <jotham> pretty sure most of oop is absolute obnoxious bullshit, right
[17:32:46] <jotham> but was quite commited to it at one point
[17:33:24] <jotham> anyway only point was making is you don't have to airquotes art, it's its own thing unrelated to good pictures and good music or whatever
[17:33:33] <jotham> mostly we just want good craft not good art
[17:35:23] <Renderwww> didn't you have a fine arts degree?
[17:35:44] <jotham> yes
[17:35:56] <jotham> that's why i know people mocking art is dumb
[17:36:03] <jotham> like i said, most of art is like craft beer
[17:36:09] <jotham> it's too hoppy for a normal person to drink
[17:36:19] <jotham> or like programming culture, oop went absolutely bananas for a period there
[17:36:28] <jotham> subcultures aren't really what outsiders want to consume
[17:36:38] <Renderwww> call me a philistine but I'm okay with mocking taping a banan to a wall and calling it art
[17:36:38] <jotham> we just want good craft
[17:36:43] <jotham> so things don't crash and look pretty
[17:36:54] <Renderwww> also it's all just a money laundering scam
[17:36:56] <jotham> yeah that's the point i was trying to make above
[17:37:09] <jotham> you're mocking the hoppy beer or the oop wank
[17:37:11] <jotham> which is fine to do
[17:37:17] <jotham> but art isn't really what people want
[17:37:22] <jotham> they just want the craft 
[17:37:27] <jotham> in any domain
[17:37:42] <jotham> a beer that tastes nice, a picture that looks nice, a program that doesn't crash (even if it's formally correct)
[17:37:53] <jotham> they want craft
[17:38:03] <jotham> mocking art is just mocking a subculture that isn't really part of the normal world
[17:38:14] <jotham> but it's always presented as 'this craft isn't very good'
[17:38:42] <jotham> ha ha ha, this picture of a tree is terrible! https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*kEhRMqZiKb4GWCSWTVvszQ.jpeg
[17:38:49] <jotham> it's not a useful distinction to make
[17:39:32] <jotham> haha, anyway not trying to have a go
[17:39:44] <jotham> i just don't think "art" is a meaningful concern for people into craft
[17:39:46] <jotham> like all of us
[17:40:05] <jotham> same as how people describe bands as 'musicians bands' 
[17:40:27] <jotham> i'd still headbutt a few dollars of pasta
[17:40:31] <jotham> it's probably some asmr shit
[17:41:33] <jotham> also that picture of a tree is very famous and probably costs millions of dollars because, like you say, wealthy people tie up money in a very tiny market of successful art works
[17:41:56] <jotham> and i think the craft value is very low
[17:46:29] <hinst> I like lewd arts
[17:46:54] <jotham> netherlands public seem to be engaged in lewd arts right now
[17:47:01] <jotham> burning scooters and trashing their public places
[17:48:12] <hinst> I do not know much about Netherlands but I am pretty sure I have a different kind of lewd arts in mind
[17:53:17] <jotham> well that is very surpising
