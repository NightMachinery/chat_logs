[05:01:45] <michigan> Can English people understand this? https://kvf.fo/utvarpstidindi?sid=128762
[05:06:54] <tinwhiskers> it's not in English, so likely no.
[05:07:04] <furrykef> Do you mean English *speakers*, or English *people*?
[05:07:13] <furrykef> (I'm American, so I'm an English speaker, but not an English person)
[05:08:03] <furrykef> Faroese? It's completely incomprehensible to me
[05:10:45] <furrykef> Why did you think we might understand it?
[05:11:06] <michigan> furrykef: English people
[05:11:31] <twb> michigan: people in England are much more likely to speak French than Faroese or Danish
[05:11:32] <michigan> It's the language of the first place above England
[05:11:56] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_England#Languages
[05:11:57] <michigan> twb: I see
[05:12:10] <michigan> I hear English is very similar to Dutch too
[05:12:23] <twb> They're both Germanic languages.
[05:12:36] <furrykef> Lots of people in England can't understand other people in England (e.g. a Londoner trying to talk with a Geordie).
[05:13:49] <michigan> I didn't know that
[05:14:07] *** zzaps is now known as zzap
[05:14:19] <michigan> One thing I've noticed however is that Welsh is eerily similar to Norwegian
[05:15:10] <twb> I'm not convinced Geordie and RP are mutually unintelligible
[05:16:06] <LjL> how on earth is Welsh even remotely close to Norwegian?!
[05:16:28] <LjL> they're not even the same branch of IE
[05:16:49] <Losher> michigan: I speak UK English, and cannot understand it. It is double-dutch (UK slang for "incomprehensible") to me
[05:17:54] <Losher> UK'ers speak French about as well as US'ers speak Spanish, and for much the same reason. 
[05:18:31] <LjL> "fairly shoddily but in some more than tiny percentage?"
[05:22:59] <Losher> LjL: non-existent/unserviceable for the most part. Or able to read French, and perhaps understand some of it, but not to speak it, since teaching people to *speak* French is labour-intensive and impractical in larger classes.
[05:24:49] <michigan> I'm trying to understand. There's been a lot of cases, but I can't remember them first-hand.
[05:25:47] <michigan> My friend is from Anglesey, Wales, and the first thing that struck me was how the name "Engeløya" means "Island of Angels" in Norwegian
[05:26:52] <michigan> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engeløya
[05:26:53] <Losher> I don't know much Welsh, and when we visited, we noticed e.g. local shopkeepers in conversation with regulars would shift from English into Welsh when we entered the store

[05:28:32] <LjL> Losher, so more or less the way people here know English if simply out of school and with no other experience :P
[05:28:38] <Losher> Anyone else watching Ragnarok?
[05:29:32] <Losher> LjL: the big difference is that speak English daily. Unless you go to a very enlightened school, that's not gonna happen with your French. 
[05:31:01] <LjL> michigan, twb: Engeløya may well mean "island of the angels", but the Norwegian word for England is "England" while Engeløya "is an island in the northern part of Steigen Municipality in Nordland county, Norway"
[05:31:21] <LjL> Losher, yeah, same as it's not gonna happen with my English here!
[05:32:29] <Losher> Learning to speak a language as an adult requires someone to listen and correct you. With 30 kids to a class, that's not gonna happen. 
[05:34:07] <LjL> at the same time, i learned much more German in a (weekly afternoon) class than i learned the year after that with a private (non-professional) teacher
[05:34:27] <LjL> although to be fair i guess i learned little german in both years
[05:35:05] <michigan> LjL: The Norwegian word for England is "engeland" which means "land of meadows"
[05:35:25] <michigan> "engelsøy" means "island of angels"
[05:35:53] <LjL> michigan, just so i know, are you mostly just testing if we can quickly spot bullshit?
[05:35:55] <michigan> eng = meadow
[05:35:57] <michigan> engel = angel
[05:36:36] <LjL> maybe
[05:36:43] <LjL> but the Norwegian word for England is not "engeland"

[06:09:14] <michigan> Accent Expert Gives a Tour of U.S. Accents - (Part One) | WIRED - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1KP4ztKK0A
[06:10:55] <CuriosTiger> michigan: "Engleland" is a compound word in Norwegian, meaning "land of angels". It is not, however, the name of any country. But neither is "Engeland".
[06:11:47] <CuriosTiger> As LjL correctly pointed out, Norwegian also uses "England", with the same meaning and etymology as in English. Just a slightly different pronunciation.
[06:12:48] <michigan> Sure, but "england" means "land of meadows" in Norwegian.
[06:14:10] <CuriosTiger> That, ironically, would be "Engeland". "Eng" does mean meadow, but you need a linking vowel to combine the two.
[06:15:23] <michigan> Yep.
[06:15:26] <CuriosTiger> England, however, simply means the land of the Angles, referring to an area that is now in either northern Germany or the Netherlands.
[06:15:43] <CuriosTiger> The resemblance to the Norwegian word "eng" is coincidental.
[06:15:59] <michigan> No, that would be "engel-land".
[06:16:24] <CuriosTiger> If you were forming it as a word, yes. But it was borrowed as a proper noun.
[06:16:35] <michigan> I'm not sure about the origins, but it would make far more sense for the vikings to name it "land of meadows" than "land of angels".
[06:16:51] <CuriosTiger> The origin is that they repeated the name from the people whose country it was.
[06:16:57] <michigan> I suspect the first thing the viking saw when they landed was meadows.
[06:17:07] <michigan> * vikings
[06:17:49] <CuriosTiger> You can make up your own etymology all you want, but that won't change history.
[06:18:28] <CuriosTiger> Adding to that, the languages they spoke back then -- Old Norse and Old English, respectively -- bore little resemblance to their modern-day descendants.
[06:18:52] <michigan> History says that vikings settled all of North England.
[06:19:31] <michigan> And over centuries bred with the locals.
[06:19:32] <CuriosTiger> They settled IN much of North England, yes, an area known as the Danelaw. But there were people there when they arrived.
[06:19:53] <CuriosTiger> The Angles, the Saxon and the Jutes were already there.
[06:20:08] <michigan> There's a large debate whether the vikings were defeated.
[06:20:15] <CuriosTiger> (They had in turn displaced the former Celtic population a few centuries earlier)
[06:20:17] <michigan> Or whether they just left.
[06:20:34] <CuriosTiger> No, there isn't.
[06:20:39] <michigan> Yes there is.
[06:20:41] <CuriosTiger> Google "The Battle of Hastings".
[06:21:01] *** Joins: Cashlin (~hp@user/cashlin)
[06:21:31] <michigan> The very word "norman" is Norwegian.
[06:21:31] <CuriosTiger> The vikings weren't deported, but they lost control over the Danelaw area to the Norman French. Who were, incidentally, other vikings who had settled in Normandie and adopted French language and customs over the centuries.
[06:21:34] <michigan> It means Norwegian.
[06:22:01] <michigan> Those were the Danish vikings, not the Norwegian ones.
[06:22:09] <CuriosTiger> Actually, that's "nordmann" in modern Norwegian, but yes, the Normans were originally vikings. They were not, however, the same vikings who invaded England in the 8th and 9th century.
[06:22:22] <michigan> The Norwegian ones, from what I gather, were also the ones who first discovered the U.S.
[06:22:53] <CuriosTiger> Thinking in terms of modern borders is a mistake. Norway did not exist as a kingdom back then, and while Denmark did, it was pretty loosely defined.
[06:23:19] <CuriosTiger> the vikings were seafarers, and basically the same culture existed in what became Denmark and what became Norway.
[06:23:51] <CuriosTiger> (and also in Iceland, the Faroes, the Orkneys, the Shetlands and, as you pointed out, the Danelaw)
[06:25:18] <CuriosTiger> As for who first discovered the US...pretty sure that was the native Americans.
[06:25:27] <michigan> I agree.
[06:25:39] <CuriosTiger> But the first Europeans to land in North America were vikings, as far as we know. Specifically, Leif Ericsson.
[06:25:47] <CuriosTiger> (Or Leifr Eiriksson in Old Norse.)
[06:25:49] <hoglahoo> Thinking in terms of modern borders is a mistake. Norway did not exist as a geopolitical area back then
[06:26:02] <hoglahoo> oops, copy pasta
[06:26:06] <michigan> To put things into perspective, you could say the Danish vikings conquered Middle England, while the Norwegian vikings conquered Northern England and Iceland.
[06:26:13] <CuriosTiger> He didn't discover the US, however, but rather Canada. Specifically, Newfoundland.
[06:26:36] <michigan> And over hundreds of years, they all became indistinguishable from the locals.
[06:26:46] <CuriosTiger> Except it wasn't that neatly divided. The Norwegian and Danish vikings were, to a large extent, the same people
[06:26:54] <CuriosTiger> they spoke the same language and participated in the same raids.
[06:27:13] <CuriosTiger> it'd make as much sense to distinguish between vikings from Møre and vikings from Romsdal.
[06:27:18] <michigan> Which again is why I asked whether any English-speaking person could understand Faroese, as it seems to be a strange mix between Old English and Old Norse.
[06:27:37] <pussipupu> Neither Canada nor the US had been invented to be fair :p
[06:27:42] <CuriosTiger> Old Norse and Old English were quite similar. To the point that they could understand EACH OTHER.
[06:28:03] <CuriosTiger> Someone who grew up in England 1000 years ago would have an easier time with Faroese than someone who grew up in England today.
[06:28:26] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: Indeed. "What has since become Canada" is what Leif Ericsson discovered. :P
[06:28:28] <pussipupu> modern English is a strange mix of OE and ON (plus a bunch of stuff)
[06:28:58] <pussipupu> That's where the cases went, friction between two not quite compatible systems
[06:29:00] <CuriosTiger> Like Norman French, ecclesiastical Latin, some Celtic grammatical substrates and a smattering of loans from across the erstwhile British Empire.
[06:29:31] <CuriosTiger> Pretty sure it was the Norman French who screwed up cases. But I'd be interested in learning about the influence of Norman vikings on the French language. :P
[06:30:41] <michigan> Is there any influence?
[06:31:01] <michigan> At first glance there doesn't seem to be any.
[06:31:40] <CuriosTiger> I don't speak French, so I don't know.
[06:31:46] <michigan> However, I can tell that the French guttural-R conquered all of Europe.
[06:32:11] <CuriosTiger> but given the importance of the Normans in French history, "none" would appear unlikely, even if it's probably much more limited than the Norman French influence on English.
[06:32:39] <michigan> Supposedly it was this prince with a speech impediment.
[06:32:47] <CuriosTiger> michigan: Not all. There are Swiss and Austrian dialects of German that roll their Rs. As do most of Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sweden and Norway, to mention a few.
[06:33:04] <CuriosTiger> but it did influence much of the continent, yes.
[06:33:24] <michigan> His way of (mis)-pronouncing the R became trendy
[06:33:32] <CuriosTiger> Oh, Russian also has a rolled R. As does Scots.
[06:33:57] <michigan> And made its way up North, this is particularly evident in the Netherlands
[06:34:09] <CuriosTiger> Sure. Even in Danish.
[06:34:25] <michigan> Not so much so.
[06:34:37] <michigan> But Western Norwegian yes.
[06:34:49] <CuriosTiger> The Danish R is the same as the German/French R (again, some dialects excepted)
[06:35:18] <michigan> Danish language - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-mOy8VUEBk
[06:35:35] <CuriosTiger> The Norwegian R is rolled, with the exception of Bergen and some surrounding areas, where Hanseatic influence popularized the German pronunciation.
[06:35:48] <CuriosTiger> Kaamelåså, yes. Quite funny.
[06:35:57] <michigan> CuriosTiger: Indeed.
[06:36:46] <michigan> The Hanseatic league brought over the Dutch, which influenced both their language and their architecture.

[10:21:08] <The_Blode> In America, we have "nervous nelly" right for someone that is nervous.
[10:21:23] <The_Blode> What about someone is always telling you "You shouldn't do that" or "that's not a good idea"
[10:21:33] <The_Blode> Like, kinda like a nagging thing
[10:23:19] <michigan> The_Blode: Sounds like somebody you should avoid
[10:24:11] <michigan> I think that someone is a naysayer?
[10:24:41] <The_Blode> That person is me. :)
[10:25:14] <The_Blode> My friend is having chest pains and she's smoking 20 a day and I wanna say "You shouldn't do buy more cigs"
[10:25:38] <The_Blode> I hope it's not naysaying, I want to naysay against smoking cigarettes though.
[10:25:43] <The_Blode> But maybe it's not my place to do so
[10:25:47] <The_Blode> It's their life it's their body
[10:25:51] <The_Blode> And I need to respect it
[10:26:27] <michigan> I think you're more of a busybody.
[10:27:43] <The_Blode> Ok so I should just not try to advise on such things right?
[10:29:43] <The_Blode> Since I am here though, I have a question about English.
[10:29:49] <The_Blode> Another question :-)
[10:30:01] <The_Blode> I've been told by people that I don't have an accent.
[10:30:12] <The_Blode> So my question is, how can I develop an accent?
[10:32:15] <pussipupu> Everyone has an accent so they're making an error “unaccented English” isn't a thing
[10:32:35] <pussipupu> But if you want to develop a specific accent you could consciously modify your pronunciations
[10:32:59] <The_Blode> Thank you pussipupu
[10:33:26] <pussipupu> And move to where the accent is used of course

[10:35:10] <The_Blode> I was born and bred in the city.
[10:36:47] <The_Blode> pussipupu would you agree with michigan about me being a busybody?
[10:37:03] <The_Blode> My friend is smoking 20 cigarettes a day and she's complaining to me about chest pains.
[10:37:14] <The_Blode> My natural response is "you shouldn't smoke more cigarettes"
[10:37:27] <The_Blode> Is that really being a busybody or is just showing concern for one's health

[10:41:13] <The_Blode> My condolences Tiger
[10:41:19] <CuriosTiger> Thanks.
[10:41:43] <The_Blode> My mother also liked to smoke and drink.
[10:41:56] <The_Blode> I'm a little anti-smoking and anti-drinking.
[10:42:12] <jessicara> i think i'd be more anti-smoking if i never smoked before
[10:42:15] <The_Blode> But I don't ram it down people's throats or anything. Everybody has free will.
[10:42:39] <jessicara> yeah having smoked before, that's a harder addiction to break than anything else experienced
[10:43:06] <jessicara> much better to never even start in the first place
[10:43:26] <CuriosTiger> I don't get why people start. I get it's addictive, and I'd prefer a ban. But before you protest, I know it wouldn't work.
[10:43:26] <The_Blode> Unfortunately, when I was in secondary school, I didn't have that many mates so I never got to be in that group of kids that experimented with smoking. This led to me not learning the correct smoking technique (whether to suck or to blow on the cigarette) and therefore, I missed the opportunity to begin smoking. I'm 33 now and I have no desire to start.

[10:43:53] <The_Blode> I missed my chance to start years ago.
[10:43:54] <CuriosTiger> I have no idea why you prefaced all that with "unfortunately". Sounds like you dodged a bullet.
[10:43:59] <jessicara> started because at that young age you don't believe what are being told because everything else is demonstratably wrong
[10:44:28] <jessicara> so assume are wrong about smoking, so don't have a clue what are getting in to
[10:45:16] <The_Blode> Yeah maybe it is fortunate I dodged all that lifestyle. I don't want to promote smoking but I have been told that smoking provides certain beneficial effects like anxiety relief...and that is something I crave. I wish I could have that in a non damaging form.
[10:45:35] <CuriosTiger> You can. There's medication that a doctor can prescribe.
[10:45:52] <CuriosTiger> or a psychiatrist.
[10:45:59] <jessicara> i mean listen to this nugget of anti-wisdom was told growing up: that girls have a floating rib and this is why it's dangerous to exercise
[10:46:13] <The_Blode> Apologies Tiger, I'm kinda anti-medication too. Just based on my own experiences with certain medications. It stupid because I haven't tried every medication ever invented.
[10:46:37] <CuriosTiger> I share that, based on my experience with being put on ritalin by well-meaning parents listening to a well-meaning pediatrician.
[10:46:41] <jessicara> going from that to "probably wrong about smoking and drugs" isn't much a leap
[10:46:44] <The_Blode> Psych sounds great...only problem for is the cost is quite high where I am.
[10:47:13] <CuriosTiger> I had ADHD as a kid, and I'm sure the ritalin made me more manageable. But it also made me feel like a bit of a zombie. Like I wasn't really myself.
[10:47:17] <The_Blode> Floating rib?
[10:47:22] <The_Blode> I've never heard anything like that.
[10:47:48] <CuriosTiger> Heck, I still have some symptoms of adult ADHD, but I've found ways to live with it that don't involve medication.
[10:47:51] <The_Blode> Yeah I've heard about Ritalin from my old Asperger support groups.
[10:48:09] <CuriosTiger> Have you been diagnosed with Asperger's?
[10:48:13] <The_Blode> Also, it's mentioned in the Foo Fighters song.
[10:48:17] <CuriosTiger> (not required to answer, obviously. I'm just curious.)
[10:48:33] <The_Blode> Yes I have been.
[10:48:39] <The_Blode> I don't usually tell people that though.
[10:48:47] <The_Blode> But it's okay.
[10:49:09] <The_Blode> If I do say it, I fear people will treat me differently.
[10:49:26] <jessicara> The_Blode: yeah it's taking medical terminology and using it very incorrectly
[10:49:34] <The_Blode> I get offended when people say "hey buddy"

[10:50:57] <jessicara> and have to recontextualize lol
[10:51:15] <CuriosTiger> The_Blode: I have a Brazilian coworker who says "hey buddy" in Teams messages.
[10:51:34] <CuriosTiger> I consider that inappropriate as I'm not his friend, just his colleague -- but since he's a non-fluent speaker of English, I can forgive it.
[10:51:47] <CuriosTiger> and therefore forgive him
[10:52:05] <CuriosTiger> It still raises my hackles just a tad when I hear a Teams message come in from him, though.
[10:52:20] <The_Blode> I think one of my old colleagues at work put it quite succintly. He took me aside and said "Dude, you're logic is completely flawed"
