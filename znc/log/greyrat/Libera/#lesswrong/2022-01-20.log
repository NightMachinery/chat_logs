[00:00:01] <ggreer> scott's review of galef's book hits the nail on the head: the only bias that matters is confirmation bias. believe whatever you want as long as you have some idea of what would change your mind
[00:00:04] <zebrask> Like I don't know galambo, but I doubt I've met people.
[00:00:36] <galambo> I think the main advantage of being involved in the rationality community is that there are no taboos about saying things the way they are. so you spot loopholes or glitches in the matrix
[00:00:40] <galambo> like bitcoin
[00:00:45] <galambo> or covid early on
[00:01:00] <ggreer> or covid now
[00:01:14] <zebrask> Part III of "I can tolerate anything but the outgroup" really resonates with me.
[00:01:17] <galambo> its like a bunch of people playing slay the spire but in real life
[00:01:39] <zebrask> Wherein Scott does the numbers on exactly how much of a bubble he lives in.
[00:01:40] <spxtr> yeah there's a handful of scott alexander posts that I think do a better job than most of the sequences combined
[00:01:48] <galambo> (the purpose of slay the spire is to break the game by using a weird combination of cards that synergises into crazy combos)
[00:02:09] <spxtr> isn't that called munchkin?
[00:02:16] <galambo> yes yes munchkin
[00:02:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Was that a Dasha N reference
[00:02:32] <zebrask> Like I probably know more people who have attended Ivy League universities than regularly watch NASCAR.
[00:02:47] <galambo> zebrask, is your username a play on zefrank?
[00:02:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know anyone who watches NASCAR ever
[00:03:05] <galambo> I do like formula 1. does that count?
[00:03:25] <spxtr> I think one of my uncles watches nascar? Most of my friends irl attend ivy league, if you count Stanford as ivy league :)
[00:03:27] <kuudes> I presume it is from sc2
[00:03:53] <kuudes> though that has extra n I suppose
[00:04:19] <galambo> I know a lot of people who watch soccer/non-american football. I dont watch it anymore though
[00:04:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've actually seen the Indy Speedway! And even so I don't know anyone IRL who's into car racing
[00:04:31] <zebrask> galambo: No, it's a name. Zebulon Rask
[00:04:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> (It's very big)
[00:05:37] <kuudes> sc2 had zebransk
[00:05:54] <galambo> I think the yearly formula 1 documentary series on netflix is pretty good
[00:06:04] <galambo> I think its the only sports related thing I watch
[00:06:29] <galambo> its like peak engineering and peak driving skills pushed to their limit
[00:07:04] <galambo> and I dont even drive a car

[00:07:57] <Betawolf> lol that list says you need a 130 IQ to write a novel
[00:08:30] <zebrask> Betawolf: Or a legible article!
[00:08:32] <galambo> iq 130 is smarter than 98% of the population
[00:09:12] <kuudes> there are not very many novelists, or are there?
[00:09:28] <spxtr> remember that adult literacy is 86%, and was much lower a few decades ago.
[00:09:52] <spxtr> Your IQ is probably higher than you think if you only compare yourself to other educated peers and have never taken a test.
[00:10:03] <galambo> I feel so blessed. I am smrter than 90% of the population and my penis is bigger than 99.99% of the population
[00:10:36] <galambo> ok I exaggerated a bit. its 99.98%
[00:10:39] <gwern> zebrask: oh sure, it won't make you filthy rich *now* after cryptocurrencies have gone mainstream
[00:12:36] <zebrask> gwern: I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have made me filthy rich back then.
[00:13:44] <catern> lol
[00:13:56] <catern> i just got prescribed adderall
[00:14:06] <gwern> more of a chance than you had otherwise, and plenty of rats made out like bandits
[00:14:29] <catern> through this thing https://www.donefirst.com/ a consultation with some doctor (a nurse practitioner I think)
[00:14:30] <Robomot> Done. ADHD Managed | ADHD Treatment Made Just For You (Personalized ADHD treatment delivered. Book an appointment with our licensed psychiatric providers as soon as the next day.)
[00:14:31] <zebrask> Yeah, I mean I have $10k in BTC because I bought modafinil for 13 BTC 12 years ago and there was some left over 😛
[00:14:34] <gwern> sad to say, other correct calls like cryonics or AI don't deliver quite the same rapid extremely-concentrated-money returns
[00:14:41] <zebrask> But if it were anything but a trivial amount, I would have sold it long ago.
[00:15:14] <galambo> gwern, how can you make monetary gains from betting on AI?
[00:15:42] <gwern> galambo: exactly. that's why crypto is going to be a once-in-a-life chance for rationality to show its value in a way that translates to millions of dollars within a few years
[00:16:18] <gwern> we are right about many things far far more important than cryptocurrencies... but none of them are as rapid or deliver super-exponential returns in hard currency
[00:17:05] <catern> here's how the consultation went: her: "hello" me: "hello" her: "what brings you to me today?" me: "um... I made an appointment on DoneFirst for an ADHD consultation?" her: "what ADHD symptoms are you having?" me: "uh... I'm distracted at work and can't focus on a single project, and I miss appointments a lot" her: "ok, do you know what adderall is? I'm prescribing you adderall 5mg"
[00:17:24] <kuudes> indeed, it answered "if you are so smart, why aren't you rich"... but but
[00:17:25] <catern> then a bunch of disclaimers about adderall. that's literally, literally all it was.
[00:18:25] <gwern> kuudes: people will move the goalpost, as if opportunities like cryptocurrency should be expected to come along every few years, but the ones in good faith will think about it
[00:20:31] <zebrask> gwern: I think one thing I'm unclear about is whether using actual rationality techniques would make you want to invest in cryptocurrencies like that, or if it's more of a social network effect that made rationalists more likely to be early investors.
[00:20:44] <rmmh> catern: lmao
[00:20:57] <kuudes> gwern, indeed.
[00:21:30] <catern> and... the prescription just came in via text
[00:21:49] <galambo> zebrask, yes but the same people were worried about covid very early on
[00:21:51] <gwern> zebrask: I don't think it was social networks. it didn't come from the top - vitalik, for example, was nobody on LW. wei dai was against bitcoin for the most part because he disliked its monetary policy etc. nick szabo was pretty quiet and uninfluential. finney didn't pump it. etc
[00:22:28] <galambo> I like to keep gloating I bought a mask in january
[00:22:36] <galambo> 2020
[00:22:55] <gwern> you could argue that *I* was the 'top', I guess, since I did do some writing about it and people did buy in because of me, but it certainly didn't feel like it at the time
[00:23:48] <zebrask> I guess I just mean that social proximity to the kinds of people working on "black swan" type technologies means you are much more likely to hear about these things before other people.
[00:24:33] <galambo> I see people around me doing stupid things all the time
[00:24:47] <galambo> and its a social faux pas to call them out on it
[00:24:58] <zebrask> My thought at the time was, "I am a grad student and I have no money, so I'm not going to waste $100 on this." but if I had heard about it 2 years later I'd be like, "What is $100?" — but I also would have sold it all when that $100 became $100k. Was that me being irrational?
[00:25:28] <gwern> zebrask: I feel like that's inadequate because bitcoin was *so* famous early on. like, anyone slightly interested in tech would've heard of bitcoin in like 2013 when it was what, $50? $100? that's not all that different from buying in at $1
[00:25:44] <gwern> or even in like 2019, bitcoin was flirting with... $2k?
[00:25:46] <zebrask> Oh I was talking about buying in at $1.
[00:25:59] <rmmh> >tfw you read the bitcoin white paper when it was 5 cents, but were a broke college kid
[00:26:05] <kuudes> iirc it was still less than 10$ when I heard of it, which was around 2013 I think
[00:26:05] <galambo> fwiw metaculus is making bold predictions about bitcoin
[00:26:28] <zebrask> I remember when it hit parity with the dollar and everyone was like, "This is way overheated, no way it's worth this much."
[00:27:09] <gwern> my point is, maybe you could not have easily become a bitcoin billionaire by the time you heard about it, shorn of social networking advantages, but you could still have easily become a millionaire

[00:29:43] <zebrask> In any case, I'll concede the point that rationality is probably very useful for this sort of thing, I guess.
[00:30:08] * gwern shrugs from atop his pile of utility
[00:30:31] <zebrask> It feels weird to concede that because I think I may have gotten into a position where I was arguing against something I actually believe, which is that rationality is in general useful for you daily life.

[00:31:32] <zebrask> I guess I'm not convinced that you can take people and run them through the sequences and have it dramatically alter the median or modal person's life circumstances.
[00:33:45] <rmmh> Before enlightenment; chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment; chop wood, carry water.
[00:34:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: Of course not, because the median or modal person won't even understand most of it!
[00:35:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: The median or modal person is like 100 IQ!
[00:36:31] <zebrask> Oormot\Arcturus: Yeah, but the people who will understand it are also almost certainly in high demand in various white collar industries.
[00:37:03] <catern> bitcoin certainly was a disproof of my outside-view-focused philosophy
[00:37:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: Y...yes? And?
[00:37:53] <gwern> I would say bitcoin is more of a disproof of arguments like those givewell used to make about, essentially, thinking everything is normally/exponentially distributed and ignoring fat tails
[00:38:10] <gwern> even at 1% chance of success, the startup-esque outcomes of bitcoin made it a screaming buy
[00:38:59] <catern> yes, but my reason for not buying bitcoin was pure "anyone who wants you to do something weird-by-normal-standards is scamming you" reasoning
[00:39:04] <zebrask> Obormot\Arcturus: I think the median / modal person who will grok the sequences may already be living life on "easy mode" anyway, rationality or no.
[00:39:30] <gwern> "you mean I can, for a few hundred dollars and an hour or two of work, buy a meaningful chunk of equity in a fantastic startup which could become worth as much as hundreds of billions of dollars, and never need to lift another finger again, and there is exactly zero downside whatsoever?"
[00:39:31] <zebrask> I wasn't trying to become a software engineer, I have a PhD in something totally different, but you know, markets decided to reallocate me.
[00:39:52] <catern> obviously anyone actually looking at the EV from inside-view would buy, but...
[00:40:19] <kuudes> it didn't seem to me a hour or two until a bitcoin atm came near me sadly :-(
[00:41:24] <gwern> "and *also* I can us it to buy drugs?"

[01:22:03] <zebrask> When I moved to NYC my PCP was super weird about continuing to prescribe me adderall, which I had been on for like 6 years (and then another 10 years on concerta before that).

[01:22:49] <catern> 5 minute consultation

I'm distracted at work and can't focus on a single project, and I miss appointments a lot" her: "ok, do you know what adderall is? I'm prescribing you adderall 5mg"
[01:22:57] <zebrask> He wanted all kinds of documentation from doctors who had left Kaiser and such and I was like, "When this prescription I already have runs out, I will lose the executive capacity required to fulfill any of your requests..."
[01:23:08] <zebrask> I ended up just switching PCPs.
[01:23:41] <kiboneu> catern: neat thanks
[01:23:42] <zebrask> Heh, yeah, I was here for that.
[01:24:22] <zebrask> It's got me mildly worried for the inevitable moral panic about how someone is making too much money pumping wall street full of adderall.
[01:24:38] <kiboneu> i was just going through my backlog and realized that i missed catern's message
[01:24:42] <kiboneu> probably due to adhd
[01:24:49] <kiboneu> (from yesterday)
[01:25:13] <zebrask> Which will probably put up more bureaucratic barriers in front of people least capable of navigating bureaucracy.
[01:26:02] <zebrask> I think about 10 years ago was the first time a doctor started saying they wanted me to come in and do follow-up visits, in person, once per quarter, if I wanted to keep getting stimulants. I think one of my PCPs wanted to drug test me since then.

[01:26:51] <zebrask> The quarterly visits seem to be universal now, though. Luckily with the pandemic I can do them as telemedicine, but they definitely feel like a way for the doctors to have something they can bill insurance for to compensate themselves for the risk they are taking by prescribing controlled substances.
[01:27:38] <catern> kiboneu: which message?

[03:14:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, I am reading this ACX post and am reminded of something that always confuses me when I read discussions of the American health care system:
[03:15:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> So people are like "health care in the U.S. works like so-and-so, and this is [ good | bad ] in these-and-such ways". But.
[03:15:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> As far as I understand, if you are a customer of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Permanente then the way health care works for you is very different from the way it works for people who are customers of, like, other health insurance plans or w/e!
[03:16:00] <Robomot> Kaiser Permanente - Wikipedia (Kaiser Permanente (/ˈkaɪzər pɜːrməˈnɛnteɪ/; KP), commonly known simply as Kaiser, is an American integrated managed care consortium, based in Oakland, California, United States, founded in 1945 by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser and physician Sidney Garfield. Kaiser Permanente is made up of three distinct but interdependent groups of entities: the Kaiser Foundation Health …)
[03:16:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And they have like double-digit millions of customers!
[03:17:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I pretty much never see discussions of American healthcare be like "if you have Kaiser, it is like X; otherwise, like Y; the differences are because Z; X is [ better | worse ] than Y, because W; [ Y | X ] exists despite [ X | Y ] being better for reason U ..."
[03:17:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> But without a discussion like that, everything else said in all such discussions is suspect!
[03:18:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like I recall *once* in *one* of Scott's healthcare posts he just goes "oh yeah and uh Kaiser exists and I guess uh some stuff is different there" and then he just drops the subject forever
[03:18:54] <kuudes> can people outside california join kaiser?
[03:19:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[03:19:09] <kuudes> is that expensive?
[03:19:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I DON'T KNOW
[03:19:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the point!
[03:19:19] <kuudes> *nods*
[03:19:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh and *inevitably* there's people in the comments going "I have Kaiser and it's very different from everything you said and is great" and then ... nothing comes of that
[03:19:54] <kuudes> is it known how much it costs if you suddenly would not fall ill, ie some sort of membership fee or something
[03:20:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have literally no idea
[03:20:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> about any of that or almost any other question you're going to ask
[03:20:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're good questions!
[03:20:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> But isn't it *super weird* that none of this is mentioned or discussed in all these long in-depth dives into "how and why is American healthcare"
[03:21:13] *** Joins: Mateon1 (~Thunderbi@user/mateon1)
[03:21:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> "KP's quality of care has been highly rated and attributed to an emphasis on preventive care, its doctors being salaried rather than paid on a fee-for-service basis, and an attempt to minimize the time patients spend in high-cost hospitals by carefully planning their stay. However, Kaiser has had disputes with its employees' unions; repeatedly faced civil and criminal charges for falsification of records and patient dumping;
[03:21:25] <Obormot\Arcturus>  faced action by regulators over the quality of care it provided, especially to patients with mental health issues; and faced criticism from activists and action from regulators over the size of its cash reserves."
[03:21:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Those upsides seem amazingly good and at least half those downsides aren't even downsides at all
[03:22:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why is *everything* not Kaiser
[03:22:20] <kuudes> do you know what you should contact if you want to consider joining kaiser?
[03:22:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well they don't operate in NYS
[03:22:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not just CA but it's also not the whole country
[03:22:40] <kuudes> hmm, ok
[03:22:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I don't know why *that* is either!)
[03:23:10] <kuudes> ... if a kaiser person from cali gets ill while in nyc what happens (no on knows?)
[03:23:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean I sure don't know
[03:23:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> No doubt *someone, somewhere* knows...
[03:23:38] <kuudes> you could try to join them and report what happened? :D
[03:23:38] <gwern> if kaiser is so great, perhaps they just pay for a first-class ticket home that day :)
[03:24:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway it's just ... this big gaping hole in these discussions
[03:24:22] <kuudes> "permanent emperor" sounds ominous
[03:24:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it makes me suspect every other thing said in those discussions of being bullshit

[03:49:56] <saturn2> if you're in kaiser you know you're in kaiser and nothing else applies to you, if you're not in kaiser you also know that and the normal rules apply

[03:52:56] <gwern> the first rule of kaiser club is you don't talk about kaiser club?
[03:53:22] <saturn2> and all insurers have rules about what you can do while travelling, most people ignore them and just roll the dice on getting stuck with hundreds of thousands in medical bills
[03:54:41] <adiabatic> kaiser club isn't on the internet
[03:54:53] <adiabatic> they're mostly normies
[03:55:25] <adiabatic> also most people are leery of talking about their medical problems on the internet for all sorts of reasons
[03:55:56] <adiabatic> so if you have to actually engage with your medical provider, then you probably get a handful of anecdotes you only want to share face-to-face with friends or maybe coworkers
[03:56:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: That doesn't really answer any of the questions
[03:57:20] <saturn2> why isn't everyone in kaiser? because the employers decide and the quality of care is only marginally relevant to them

[10:17:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... lol: when you create a new Share Extension project in Xcode (to add custom functions to the Share context menu in Cocoa apps), the default boilerplate code for the extension's view controller has an isContentValid method which checks for shared text length
[10:17:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it's hardcoded to check for "<= 140 characters"
[10:18:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess that's just, like, a general feature of the universe
[10:18:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> That things you share on social media of any kind can't be longer than 140 characters
[10:22:27] <quanticle> Well, it used to be, but Jack Dorsey (a.k.a. God) rewrote that particular fundamental constant before he retired.
[10:22:43] <quanticle> I guess Apple didn't get the memo.
[10:23:31] <quanticle> Alternative formulation: the original calculation for the fundamental constant length of social media messages was off by a factor of two, and thus we find that the actual limit is 280 characters, not 140.
[10:23:53] <quanticle> Unless you're using CJK script, in which case, the characters count as double-wide and the limit is still 140.
[10:24:27] <quanticle> Think of it this way: it's a refinement of the original discovery, much like Einstein's Relativity was refinement on top of Newtonian Mechanics

[18:15:00] <zebrask> I'd like some variation of the "curbcut effect" to trickle down from people trying to max out their stats to play basketball or ballet or biking or something.
[18:17:13] <zebrask> I can't even find anyone trying to cheat at sports that require significant flexibility. As someone who is very, very inflexible and has never managed to change that with any stretching program I've engaged in, I'm definitely ready for an injection or a pill or something that makes it so you can touch your toes.
[18:19:38] <phill> ethics people would be furious
[18:22:37] <kuudes> personally I am for the sport participants having higher and final say on doping rules
[18:23:29] <kuudes> medical community and ads could advice, but imo there should be some sort of parliament-like thing which should be elected to represent the athletes, which should make the actual decision on what the rules are

[18:24:58] <PapuaHardyNet> "it's not FAIR that they are using hormones to be able to lift more than me!" ethics people are annoying. ubermensch bullshit aside, why don't they focus on real problems like ensuring UBI or social safety nets globally
[18:26:18] <phill> nah, they're more afraid of the dangerous side effects of people taking substances to the extreme
[18:26:24] <phill> (as many athletes would do in a heartbeat)
[18:27:06] <phill> kuudes: leagues like NBA and NFL have player unions who usually negotiate with the league for stuff like that
[18:33:33] <zebrask> It would be convenient for my position if it were the case that people already take substances to the extreme, but they currently do it in a way that is more likely to cause harm to themselves because they have to optimize for effectiveness, safety and not getting caught.
[18:33:54] <zebrask> Whereas in a "no substances banned" situation, they'd be optimizing for just effectiveness and safety.
[18:34:26] <phill> nah, they don't really care much about safety
[18:35:01] <zebrask> Clearly they have to care about safety enough that they don't die before they get to make use of their enhancements.
[18:35:50] <zebrask> It's probably true that doing it in the open would be safer than what they are doing now, but also that many more people would do it and overwhelm the net safety benefits.
[18:36:55] <phill> especially the higher you go, it's "whatever will give me the competitive edge"
[18:37:04] <phill> ofc if you die, you can't compete
[18:37:04] <kuudes> well, sportspeople already die in their thirties in some sports
[18:37:41] <pompolic> i have an idea
[18:37:55] <phill> i know quite a few of my teammates who would have done almost *anything* to get that competitive advantage

[18:39:52] <mst> also most serious athletic careers start young enough that where it comes to safety the rules are acting as a substitute for judgement they don't have yet
[18:40:23] <kuudes> hi mst
[18:40:26] <phill> and i was only at a college level, for people who weren't even paid that much. i can only imagine at the pro level it's even more exacerbated
[18:40:46] <PapuaHardyNet> phill, you were a college athlete?
[18:40:53] <phill> (and in addition to what mst said, sometimes it's not even them making the decision...it's a coach/parent)
[18:40:53] <PapuaHardyNet> what sport?
[18:41:07] <phill> PapuaHardyNet: track and field and american football
[18:44:06] <PapuaHardyNet> darn, that's impressive
[18:44:26] <PapuaHardyNet> well, you need an impressive physique to even be in american football - that's what I think is impressive
[18:44:43] <phill> football only for 2 years though
[18:44:55] <phill> and i wouldn't call it "impressive"
[18:45:09] <phill> i was a lineman/thrower, so i was pretty strong
[18:45:24] <phill> but not the most aesthetically pleasing
[18:45:30] <zebrask> I imagine that the underlying justification is actually some sort of naturalistic conservativism on the part of fans and players, but there's an argument to be made that because sports are purely positional zero-sum games, you want to set the rules so that the competitive equilibrium isn't one where people are incentivized to take a lot of risks.
[18:47:17] <zebrask> People who engage in competitive sports do take risk already, but if you could perfectly enforce "no banned substances" and you banned any substances that can have significant negative side effects, everyone will be better off (except fans who want to see someone with unnatural speed or strength do something — but most fans just care about relative ability, not absolute ability).
[18:49:05] <zebrask> Still I think that embracing human enhancement could easily be beneficial for a bunch of people, so there are likely at least some positive externalities that come along with sports people trying to optimize for some sport or another by any means necessary.
[18:52:14] <zebrask> I'm still kinda bummed that I can't find anyone trying to chemically improve their flexibility, though. Maybe I wouldn't even benefit from an "all enhanced olympics", considering that no one seems to have bothered finding ways to "cheat" at this.
[18:54:10] <PapuaHardyNet> zebrask: have you thought of going to a licensed uhh, medical expert in physiology and flexibility?
[18:54:53] <gwern> (8k to go...)
[18:55:32] <mst> I mean, in terms of things like "what are the safe limits for steroid use", hollywood action movie stars are conducting that experiment for us already
[18:55:46] <gwern> .note adiabatic in yt naother gotcha, the (mt) archives in the academic databases only go to 2010 for some reason, so that may be why a 2013 article doesn't show up in GS, just not there upstrea
[18:57:08] <zebrask> PapuaHardyNet: Does the "uhh" mean like the kind of licensed medical expert who operates out of the back of a van? Or like, "Maybe talk to your doctor first before hanging out behind Cirque du Soleil trying to score from the contortionists."
[18:58:44] <zebrask> Every time I talk to doctors about this stuff they're like, "Yeah, stretching is important." and I'm like, "Well I wasn't even able to comfortably sit cross-legged when I was 8 years old so I think stretching might just make me *less* pathologically inflexible, not actually flexible."
[18:58:57] <PapuaHardyNet> the "uhh" was basically me blanking out on the name for the medical experts. There's a small set of sports physiology experts that cater to extremely well paid sports stars and sports teams
[18:59:38] <PapuaHardyNet> those people seem like the sort of crowd that may help you, partly because they have the knowledge, both theoretical and practical, and also the willingness to try unorthodox things to gai nresults
[19:01:43] <gwern> zebrask: it's not clear stretching is important, or at least the kind you're thinking of
[19:02:16] <zebrask> gwern: Like you mean static stretching?
[19:02:19] <gwern> yes
[19:03:17] <zebrask> Yeah, I am not sure. I try to do PNF stretching where possible, and range of motion exercises.
[19:03:55] <zebrask> I don't think it actively hurts, and there are people who increase their range of motion with static stretching, so I suspect it might be a case where static stretching is non-optimal but does something.
[19:04:47] <zebrask> Apparently there's a steroid called Winstrol that can increase flexibility. I wonder if I can get a doctor to give it to me off-label for pathological inflexibility.

[23:41:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Well I am not an expert in pretty much any of the technical fields involved with this plan, but to my totally layman's eye it seems like a good one?
[23:41:16] <kuudes> nice
[23:41:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems like there's some hidden costs though
[23:41:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like relocating the ferry port
[23:41:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is on the part of the shoreline that wouldn't be shoreline anymore
[23:42:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the river width gets shrunk
[23:42:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> So how does that affect ship/boat traffic up the East River?
[23:42:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> But presumably (?) they have good answers for these questions?
[23:43:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> I certainly see no reason to object to the basic principle
[23:43:30] <Ralith> I hear good things about the framework
[23:43:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> I like that the expansion involves putting Governors Island to good use
[23:44:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a solid chunk of largely wasted land right now
[23:44:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh I didn't even notice the proposed bridge and G subway line extension
[23:44:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's even better
[23:45:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> That actually may be one of the best features of this plan, lol
[23:46:06] *** Joins: voltage (voltage@user/voltage)
[23:46:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the other hand it's also one of the biggest reasons it's unlikely to proceed
[23:46:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> NYC ain't exactly good at building subway stations/lines quickly these days
[23:47:04] <PapuaHardyNet> as usual, the solution to my problem was to abandon the use of a library function causing me an issue and either roll my own implementation, or use the default jax implementation
[23:47:31] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)

[23:53:19] <catern> hm I should make it easier to follow my projects I guess
[23:53:55] <catern> someone just asked me "how can I follow what you're doing" and tbh I don't have a great answer other than "check what I'm doing on github"
[23:54:10] <gwern> if they can't just read your diffs, do they *deserve* to follow it
[23:54:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Construct a unified RSS feed of all your project commits
[23:55:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: And auto-post it to your site also

[23:56:12] <Robomot> Jordan Peterson takes the black pill and goes to town on those who just stand by (Here is his rant on why he's leaving his position at the University of Toronto You really need the whole thing to realize how blackpilled it is, but here's a few bits. [This means we’re out to produce a generation of researchers utterly unqualified for the job. And we’ve seen what that means already in the horrible grievance …)
