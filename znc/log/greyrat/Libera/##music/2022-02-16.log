[00:02:41] <morlog> scuse me
[00:02:57] <murthy> Don't you feel sad when you leave things behind
[00:03:20] <morlog> nope
[00:03:26] <murthy> Don't you have an ounce of attachment at all?
[00:03:51] <morlog> not much of one
[00:04:08] <murthy> Those things going to suffer
[00:04:37] <morlog> growing up my dad used to take all my things and throw them away every now and then
[00:04:48] <morlog> didn't have much
[00:05:32] <morlog> moved a lot so I didn't have many friends
[00:05:32] <murthy> You know what, you and me should go beat the sht of your dad
[00:05:59] <morlog> I'm nd of hard for me to attach to anything
[00:06:06] <morlog> kind of hard
[00:06:17] <murthy> I understand
[00:06:36] <murthy> It's very very strange though for me
[00:06:49] <murthy> I have strong attachment to things

[00:14:09] <morlog> I don't know
[00:14:57] <murthy> It's not like you hate all the places right? For example you like Iowa right?
[00:15:16] <morlog> it's the people
[00:15:36] <murthy> Yep, nice people is all we need
[00:16:55] <morlog> also it's poor living conditions
[00:17:04] <murthy> Oh

[00:17:19] <morlog> in a tent in Texas really sucks in the summer
[00:17:30] <murthy> morlog: indeed
[00:17:46] <murthy> Texas is testing weather
[00:17:52] <morlog> it's something I can do from a distance for the most part

[00:19:28] <morlog> you know, I'd rather not go without just to make other people happy

[00:42:46] <MusicalDillo> Hi murthy
[00:43:53] <murthy> MusicalDillo: you people are enjoying Superbowl?
[00:44:40] <MusicalDillo> I didn't watch it
[00:44:49] <MusicalDillo> That was last Sunday
[00:44:54] <murthy> Oh ok
[00:45:20] <MusicalDillo> and Texas wasn't in it :P
[00:45:25] <murthy> I thought it was like a world football matches
[00:45:39] <murthy> Goes on for like weeks
[00:46:03] <MusicalDillo> No, they have all the play-offs long before that
[00:46:12] <MusicalDillo> that's a very long process
[00:46:13] <murthy> Oh ok
[00:46:15] <MusicalDillo> over months
[00:46:27] <murthy> Right
[00:46:34] <MusicalDillo> then the best of the AFC and the NFC play each other
[00:46:43] <MusicalDillo> at the Superbowl
[00:46:46] <murthy> So super bowel is a final match
[00:46:50] <MusicalDillo> yes
[00:46:54] <murthy> Ok
[00:47:01] <MusicalDillo> super bowel lol
[00:47:21] <murthy> That makes sense of nativetexan's enthusiasm
[00:47:26] <MusicalDillo> that would be a farting contest?
[00:47:43] <murthy> Super Bowl :)

[00:49:39] <murthy> I found hitchhiker's guide wiki online
[00:50:05] <murthy> Seems India is a bad place to hitchhike
[00:50:40] <murthy> One reason is we use rail for long distance travel
[00:50:58] <murthy> Indian railways is one of the world's biggest
[00:51:43] <murthy> If you travel by road and you have spine problem you are ded
[00:51:52] <piercedwater> :(
[00:52:03] <MusicalDillo> They were a big part of transportation in the US before 'suburbanization' after WWII
[00:52:19] <murthy> MusicalDillo: ya
[00:52:58] <murthy> Rail fans in India wish for railways to become big in US
[00:56:23] <MusicalDillo> If gas prices get high enough there may be a comeback
[00:57:12] <MusicalDillo> There has been much talk of building a bullet train in Texas from Houston to Dallas through San Antonio and Austin using Japanese tech
[00:57:49] <MusicalDillo> Texas Central Railway - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Central_Railway
[00:57:49] <Janet> ^ Texas Central or Texas Central Partners, LLC, is a private railroad company that is proposing a high-speed rail line between Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston. It plans to use technology based on that used by the Central Japan Railway...
[00:58:25] <MusicalDillo> Dallas to Houston in 90 minutes would be very cool
[01:09:43] <murthy> Wow, nice!
[01:10:10] <murthy> MusicalDillo: also those Elon trains
[01:10:42] <MusicalDillo> HyperLoop?
[01:10:46] <murthy> Ya
[01:11:23] <MusicalDillo> Austin is thinking about building a subway system, and Elon has moved his tunneling company here
[01:11:34] <MusicalDillo> so who knows...
[01:11:53] <murthy> Yes get probability
[01:12:00] <murthy> Great
[01:12:05] <MusicalDillo> seems like the smart thing to do if you want to decrease the number of cars people have to use
[01:12:19] <murthy> Ya

[01:21:13] <R2robot> houston built a light railway system and within a year it set a record for the number of crashes for rail systems. -_-
[01:23:41] <MusicalDillo> haha, hadn't heard about that
[01:24:19] <MusicalDillo> The ones in Dallas in Austin work well afaik
[01:24:37] <MusicalDillo> and they're going to be expanding the commuter rail system in Austin
[01:24:42] <R2robot> "the system averaged six crashes per month, 20 times worse than the national average for light rail systems. The high rate of incidents gave rise to local derogatory nicknames among detractors such as the "Wham Bam tram" and "Danger Train"
[01:24:50] <MusicalDillo> yipes
[01:25:13] <sublim20> how are there crashes
[01:25:16] <R2robot> yeah, it's kinda nuts
[01:25:17] <sublim20> its on a rail
[01:25:25] <R2robot> car/train crashes
[01:25:30] <sublim20> but how
[01:25:32] <R2robot> train/pedestrian crashes
[01:25:38] <R2robot> because it's a poor design
[01:25:44] <sublim20> i'd have to look at it
[01:25:47] <R2robot> runs through city streets
[01:25:55] <sublim20> ahhh
[01:26:00] <R2robot> also, people don't pay attention
[01:26:07] <sublim20> yeah, they have something like that in buffalo
[01:26:15] <R2robot> hell, even I almost got hit and i knew it was there. lol
[01:26:29] <sublim20> its crazy, cause its super easy to just turn onto the rail, and start driving down the rail
[01:26:33] <sublim20> (ask me how i know)
[01:26:50] <R2robot> walking to lunch and the signs are at eye-level so you can't see it coming.. and it's electric so you can't hear it coming.. I almost walked in front of it
[01:27:05] <sublim20> that makes sense
[01:27:06] <R2robot> sublim20: lol
[01:27:50] <sublim20> the train here is fucking bonkers with constant warnings about 'mind the gap'
[01:28:05] <sublim20> all because some drunk bitch like 15 years ago fell between the platform and the train
[01:28:22] <sublim20> so now there's endless signs, and constant verbal warnings about the gap
[01:28:31] <R2robot> poor drivers + poor design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq6W45lG1Jg

[01:28:57] <sublim20> SPLAT!
[01:31:11] <R2robot> mind the sharp edges on the mind the gap signs
[01:32:00] <sublim20> the story that kicked it all off was kind of funny
[01:32:11] <sublim20> cause at first it started with 'poor young woman falls under train and dies'
[01:32:23] <R2robot> O.o
[01:32:32] <sublim20> and then there was this huge hubabaloo about the gap sizes between the platform and the train
[01:32:49] <sublim20> so they put up all the signs and stuff
[01:32:54] <sublim20> and the warnings, going overboard
[01:33:07] <sublim20> then like a year or two later, it comes out that the woman was drunk and high as fuck
[01:33:46] <sublim20> cause even if you fall down, theres space down there that a person could 'scoot' into and avoid the train
[01:34:01] <sublim20> you know, instead of like putting their bodies / head on the rail 
[01:35:05] <R2robot> sheesh
[01:35:33] <sublim20> its a classic case of the ratchet effect
