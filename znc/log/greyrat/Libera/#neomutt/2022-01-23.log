[12:58:50] <bookworm> flatcap: have fun with your crossword, no rush to respond. For the bot, do you want to exclude old issues (default on the bot is 1 year) even though someone specifically requested the issue number? I fail to see why this is desirable, considering that's all manual and not a webhook.
[12:59:37] <bookworm> also, auto-rejoin on kick seems... strange... if you kick the bot that means you don't want it anymore and it should probably terminate, no?

[13:50:20] <flatcap> morning all
[13:51:32] <flatcap> bookworm: thanks :-)
[13:52:11] <flatcap> yes, kick should probably kill the bot
[13:52:47] <flatcap> it's run as a service anyway, so it'll be reborn
[13:53:31] <bookworm> not if you terminate the bot with exit 0, assuming you mean RestartOnFailure in systemd terminology
[13:53:44] <bookworm> and a kick pretty much means: go away unconditionally
[13:54:03] <flatcap> good point. I'll check my systemd service (and check it into the repo)
[13:54:43] <bookworm> I mean up to you, my eybrowse just rose a tad when I saw the auto rejoin on kick infinite loop
[13:54:52] <flatcap> neo-bot: we love you really ♥
[13:54:59] <bookworm> eyebrows*
[13:55:41] <flatcap> :-)
[13:56:06] <flatcap> the plan for the age-limit was to prevent false-positives
[13:56:20] <bookworm> how can there be false positives?
[13:56:34] <flatcap> #num less than a year old is probably meaningful
[13:56:55] <flatcap> if I went to the #1 pizza parlour
[13:57:06] <flatcap> I don't want to talk about issue number 1
[13:57:18] <bookworm> mkey, I'll leave it in
[13:57:32] <bookworm> and you explicitly want to ignore that restriction on pm?
[13:57:45] <flatcap> if we talk to the bot directly, neomutt: #num, then ignore the limit
[13:57:49] <bookworm> ok
[13:58:41] <bookworm> ehm, wait a sec. by "talk to the bot directly" I am referring to a query, you seem to mean "ping" as in mention the bot name?
[13:58:59] <flatcap> github has the same problem with backtraces which often have the #1, #2, unless `protected`
[13:59:10] <bookworm> that's not what the bot currently does if I read the code directly
[13:59:18] <bookworm> neo-bot: #1

[17:24:11] <bookworm> not that I know of, we could change the formatting of the types or add additional stuff but that's up to you really
[17:24:41] <flatcap> I might drop the emoji for now (until there are other discussion categories)
[17:25:04] <bookworm> fair :D I don't like them particularly but you had them in your query so....
[17:25:15] <bookworm> same for num_comments
[17:25:58] <flatcap> the number of comments _might_ be of interest. we'll see
[17:26:02] <bookworm> if all that you *really* want is title / url  / date / author for everything we could simplify the code significantly
[17:26:30] <bookworm> as then you can go back to a single dataclass with those fields and simply set the type param in addition
[17:26:52] <flatcap> ah, I wondered that looking at the separate classes
[17:27:18] <bookworm> they are just there because you could modify the individual things rather than all of them

[23:23:27] <bremner> slightly odd to "back off maintainership" without announcing a replacement, but what do I know
[23:28:30] <flatcap> it's the rational thing to do, if you have a life, family etc
[23:28:39] <flatcap> (and aren't really invested in the project ;-)
[23:29:10] <flatcap> perhaps I'll put my name in the hat, to take over :-)
[23:29:38] <bremner> As a non-mutt user, I would totally vote for you :P
[23:29:50] <flatcap> thanks :-)
