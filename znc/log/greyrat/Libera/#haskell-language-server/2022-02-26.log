[21:16:53] <michaelpj> nope
[21:17:05] <michaelpj> I would guess your `hie-bios` dist-newstyle cache is busted
[21:17:23] <michaelpj> maybe you killed something at an odd time - I know cabal can get into a confused state about what files it's created or not
[21:22:54] *** Joins: dpratt (sid193493@2a03:5180:f:1::2:f3d5)
[21:27:50] <dpratt> getting back to Haskell after a while and as usual, I'm struggling with IDE stuff; I have the ghcide plugin configured in VS Code and it seems to work at a basic level, but when I add a package to the .cabal file, ghcide doesn't seem to know about it; that is, it flags imports from the package as errors; I can `cabal build` just fine
[21:29:19] <dpratt> I have not attempted to explicitly configure a "cradle", but I had the impression the default configuration should work in a typical project
[21:29:40] <dpratt> any thoughts about how to figure out where I'm going wrong here?
[21:38:30] <fendor[m]> dpratt: how do you launch HLS? Also, please use the Haskell VSCode plugin as it is actively being maintained
[21:38:56] <fendor[m]> in your terminal, you can give `haskell-language-server-wrapper --debug <path-to-file>` and paste errors if there are any
[21:39:11] <fendor[m]> <michaelpj> "I would guess your `hie-bios..." <- probably. Not a great UX
[21:42:27] <fendor[m]> but hard to change at the moment
[22:36:21] <dpratt> fendor[m]: I installed the Haskell plugin and things are looking better, thanks!
[22:37:50] <dpratt> I did see this pop-up: "haskell-language-server 1.6.1.0 for GHC 8.8.3 is not available on Linux.  Falling back to haskell-language-server 1.5.1" -- I'm going to assume that is of no concern, unless someone tells me otherwise
[23:02:09] <fendor[m]> dpratt: It basically means, you don't get the latest and greatest HLS because we don't support ghc 8.8.3 with the latest HLS anymore
