[00:00:35] <kveroneau> Good question.  Let me look that up.
[00:00:47] <vdamewood> hxx: Just make sure to use PySide instead of PyQt.
[00:00:56] <hxx> What difference does it make?
[00:01:03] <vdamewood> PyQt is GPL, not LGPL.
[00:01:16] <nomagno> kveroneau: My VM is also made specifically for a game, the difference is I'm not sure how it fits in a racing game outside an Easter egg and/or possibly some very advanced mechanic
[00:01:22] <vdamewood> Well, also, PySide is developed by The Qt Company.
[00:01:30] <nomagno> Perhaps I could use it for automation of car driving in a special mode? :O

[00:04:55] <hxx> I don't actually own a mac, so cocoa touch would be useless for me. I like objective-c because it's a very strict superset of C, more than C++.
[00:05:09] <kveroneau> vdamewood, I cannot find anything specific, but I don't see how a application couldn't be designed in Lazarus to be HIG-complient.  It has all the same widgets available in all popular widgetsets across all platforms and APIs.

[00:05:39] <vdamewood> kveroneau: Because the different HIGs for various desktops contradict each other in places.

[00:06:31] <deniska> vdamewood: there's only so far you can go without designing different GUIs for each OS
[00:06:40] <vdamewood> kveroneau: For example, on mac, the Okay/Cancel pair place the Okay button on the far right, the Cancel button just to the left of the Okay button, and the 'Fuck it, I don't care' button to the far left.
[00:06:43] <nomagno> hxx: Objective-C is tad bit too heavy, requires either GNU runtime or Apple runtime
[00:06:45] <nomagno> Not specified either
[00:06:51] <kveroneau> So, if you took the same Lazarus code with a menubar on the Linux desktop, where it's where you'd expect, and then compile on macOS against Cocoa, the menubar will be at the top of the screen where a macOS user would expect it.
[00:07:01] <vdamewood> kveroneau: On windows, they are all centered, and the okay button is on the left.

[00:30:27] <kveroneau> Yes, but when when you compile to Mac or Windows, your application also now needs to ship with all these libraries.
[00:31:05] <kveroneau> Whereas a Lazarus app, it just uses the native widgets of the target platform with minimal to no code changes on the developers side.
[00:31:17] <pyzozord> btw, js uses 64 bit floats exclusively, doesn't it mean that the ALU will be underutilized and the program will be slower than it could be?

[02:28:39] <vms14> hmm
[02:28:49] <pyzozord> in communities like this irc people often have more developed ideas and consider clean code primitve or even simply wrong

[02:29:51] <vms14> I mean about taking words from others, specially irc xd

[03:21:05] <PlanckWalk> Yes, whether the internals are exposed, whether the methods are implemented as functions or function pointers or whatever isn't so important.
[03:21:12] <[itchyjunk]> does C have objects i nthat way?
[03:21:23] <vms14> just helps you to represent something, but it could do much more
[03:21:35] <decker> anonymous strcutres can give you inhertiance
[03:21:35] <PlanckWalk> C doesn't have objects except by convention
[03:21:46] <vms14> and btw I'll tell you a thing that I've read some time ago in some random programming book
[03:21:52] <decker> but you apply attributes with has-a instead of is-a ... like a cat has-a animal representation
[03:22:02] <decker> rather than cat is-a animal
[03:22:03] <vms14> Data representation is more important than algorithms
[03:22:04] <[itchyjunk]> i mean can you create a data type and set of methods that interact with it?
[03:22:09] <macaw> [itchyjunk]: "when one says X the other seems to pick from some list relating to X" => Look into behaviour trees (gamedev, although I do not know much about this field); or more generally (CS), Theory of Computation - grammars - for this example, non-deterministic FSMs are what you're looking for.

[03:22:21] <PlanckWalk> [itchyjunk]: You can do that even in Turing machines.
[03:22:23] <vms14> and it happens that the algorithm depends on how you represent the data
[03:22:32] <PlanckWalk> The question is how much support the language gives you for it.
[03:22:34] <[itchyjunk]> interesting
[03:22:37] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: the language C does not have a notion of classes or objects (at least not in the OOP sense).  But it's of course a general-purpose programming language and you can build those abstractions yourself
[03:22:38] <PlanckWalk> And C gives you very little.

[03:23:45] <PlanckWalk> Some libraries develop their own object-like structures and conventions, but they usually aren't compatible with the structures and conventions from other libraries.
[03:24:06] <PlanckWalk> So you have to write a lot more interface code to translate.
[03:24:08] <[itchyjunk]> macaw, ive not come across graphs yet

[03:26:17] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well we're even using the word "points" here!  so yes it has pointers in that sense

[03:27:00] <kennyd> most civilized languages don't
[03:27:02] <decker> almost think the problem in C is non-pointer types.  When you go to python or JS you have no issues with everything is a pointer... 
[03:27:06] <karstensrage> java is a c based language but the designers specifically took out memory management and pointers to make it easier on programmers
[03:27:07] <PlanckWalk> Yes, instead *every* non-primitive variable is really a "pointer"
[03:27:14] <[itchyjunk]> yeah, C had something like var = blah then var* was a pointer to var or somesuch

[03:44:55] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I think they're trolling you :P
[03:44:59] <decker> it's just windows is such a huge attack surface
[03:45:02] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[03:45:38] <apotheon> Linux has been trying really hard to catch up with Windows for the virus support feature, but traditionally in the Unixy world there's far less opportunity for a virus to execute, because it far more often requires user intervention.
[03:45:41] <[itchyjunk]> virus are kind of a bot too? i guess we'ed have to define one if we ever wanna talk about it
[03:45:44] <flakland> and sometimes when they fix the vulnerability it opens up a new one!
[03:45:45] <KillerWasp> There are no viruses in Linux because there are only good guys there.
[03:45:56] <apotheon> Linux the ecosystem, not the kernel (as far as I know).
[03:46:09] <decker> right noone's gotten caught putting exploitive code in the kernel
[03:46:13] <[itchyjunk]> so as automation in linux increases, shouldn't vectors for viruses?

[03:46:41] <apotheon> A virus is not something in the kernel.
[03:46:43] <kennyd> there are no viruses in linux for the same reason there are no games, photoshop, premiere. linux is a red headed step child when it comes to non-server software, and people don't tend to spend time to port their programs for the tiny minority of the users who would use it 
[03:46:53] <apotheon> That would be a malicious vulnerability.

[03:48:21] <CaCode> some sort of genius who basically invented malware
[03:48:26] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: No, a virus is a type of malware.
[03:48:35] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: A worm is a different type of malware.
[03:48:36] <KillerWasp> It is only surpassed by the number of mobiles.
[03:48:37] <kennyd> what's the percentage of desktop users using linux?
[03:48:45] <apotheon> [itchyjunk]: . . . and adware is another different type of malware.
[03:48:51] <decker> trojan
[03:48:51] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: wikipedia defines it as a computer program that replicates itself.  Which seems like a reasonable definition
[03:48:52] <PlanckWalk> The main feature of a virus is that it replicates, usually with some user action.
[03:48:54] <[itchyjunk]> okay so not all malware are virus
[03:48:56] <KillerWasp> But really windows and macintosh is already obsolete.
[03:49:02] <[itchyjunk]> ah self replication, cool
[03:49:08] <PlanckWalk> Those that replicate entirely by themselves are usually called worms
[03:49:17] <[itchyjunk]> oh..
[03:49:20] <kennyd> let me know when I can use photoshop instead of gimp on linux and I might be interested
[03:49:25] <[itchyjunk]> i thought worms = gives you backdoor
[03:49:32] <decker> but a virus also often has a payload that is triggered later
[03:49:39] <apotheon> PlanckWalk: On Windows, it rarely requires user action.
[03:49:42] <KillerWasp> [itchyjunk]: no, a trojan have backdoor
[03:49:50] <[itchyjunk]> oh right, trojan is backdoor

[03:51:57] <apotheon> decker: On a system where software isn't allowed to just run at various times because the OS thinks it's a great idea to execute shit willy-nilly, user intervention may be required to execute the relevant software that causes the virus to replicate.

[04:07:51] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: they submitted patches to the linux kernel, and I don't believe any of them got it.  The chance they actually committed any real crime is pretty low
[04:08:02] <spokojni> average, too much birocracy

[04:08:23] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, is there any law around such things though? i guess open source is not really legally protected
[04:08:26] <[itchyjunk]> lot of good faith
[04:08:33] <isekaijin> kennyd: The main (only?) reason why regular desktop Linux is not a commercially attractive platform for consumer software is that it gives users too much freedom.
[04:08:42] <PlanckWalk> [itchyjunk]: Anyone who uses the kernel with malicious patches can sue.
[04:08:48] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: computer law varies wildly from country to country

[04:12:47] <[itchyjunk]> recursive in that sense?
[04:12:48] <spokojni> I'll just wait, in 2022 plague will be gone.
[04:13:15] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: it means that worms don't need another program to help them, they can do it themselves
[04:13:32] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: so 1 worm makes 2 copies, and each copy can make 2 copies and then each can make 2 more copies...
[04:13:40] <[itchyjunk]> say i have file.blah and i run file.blah. how does it copy itself?
[04:13:48] <[itchyjunk]> it can't open itself because file is already in use?

[04:19:14] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: this is the classic computer "worm".  Some "classic" worms spread because people run files in emails then the file copies itself and opens your email client and sends more copies of the emails out

[05:38:51] <InPhase> flakland: I've written firmware for hardware I've designed, for which the rational place to put the binary blob was in the driver I wrote.  But ultimately this is identical to sitting there and laying out an ASIC circuit to do the same sorts of things that the firmware blob does.  Moving it into a blob, or having no blob, is essentially no different in terms of the freedom to act that a piece of 
[05:38:57] <InPhase> hardware has.  It is just easier to fix problems when you have more of that behavior in a loadable piece of firmware, which is why this is done.  Hardware development time is shorter, and the ability to fix errors after the sale / deployment becomes possible.

[05:39:04] <InPhase> Sorry, that should have been addressed to Guest80.
[05:39:45] <InPhase> Guest80: Fundamentally, the right perspective is that none of your hardware is "open source" whether there is a firmware blob or not.
[05:40:34] <norias> InPhase: i know it wasn't directed at me - but i'm appreciative of the insight
[05:40:40] <InPhase> Guest80: You can even use generic FPGA or very simple microcontroller devices with open source firmware, and it's still not open source because you can't actually see what is happening inside the chips.
[05:41:20] <InPhase> It is important to assess this properly in risk models, because manufacturing chains for hardware matter a great deal in establishing a trustworthy system.

[07:12:47] <[itchyjunk]> i thought learning data strucutres first would help learn coq
[07:13:03] <[itchyjunk]> but seems like knowing coq might help with learning data structures..

[07:14:55] <[itchyjunk]> haskell is kinda dependently typed right?
[07:15:02] <[itchyjunk]> so maybe haskell is a good one?

[07:16:01] <beaky> yes once you become familiar with specifying data and constraints with formal approaches like coq or alloy and also using those tools to help you prove algorithms correct then it makes things easier since you will be used to the kinds of ways data structures get specified and stuff

[07:17:22] <beaky> not haskell because haskell lacks dependent types unlike coq or agda so you lack the power to specify even simple constraints like "x is equal to y"

[07:23:39] <beaky> but pseudocode is not the way to go because it tries to present itself as a proper formal language but is not actually adequate enough to work with directly unliek actual formal approaches to algorithm and data structure specification and verification where you can for example directly 'code' the  algorithm in an expressive way that's pretty much executable (unlike pseudocode, python as
[07:23:41] <beaky> "executable pseudocode" notwithstanding) and directly apply inductive arguments to that formal version of the algorithm or data structure and get proofs that way
[07:23:50] *** Quits: geenvoud (~geenvoud@user/geenvoud) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[07:24:59] <beaky> with a formal approach you get to study all the important proofs on the data structure by stepping through the proof and watch it fold and unfold the parts of the algorithm and rewrite terms into the propositions being verified

"NoSQL" is so broad as to be a useless category, but an awful lot of those systems expect you to operate at a much lower level, and even in the event that some nice declarative query language emerges for them, to be really useful that language would have to impose some of the very structure

[11:06:07] <average> nosql-vs-rdbms is a debate that has been proposed and packages and sold to millions of devs worldwide, and it's totally nonsensical and almost identical to the act of jerking off..
[11:06:12] <average> *packaged

[11:07:07] <apotheon> If so, you're arguing against straw men.
[11:07:19] <average> pyzozord: you know why you don't understand the differences? it's because you don't know much about the implementation of either ! because that's expensive, to read source code and algorithms of both of them, and understand how they work
[11:07:33] <average> pyzozord: so how can you possibly compare them, if you don't understand either of them at a deep enough level..
[11:08:03] <pyzozord> actually i did read things about how they work internally
[11:08:08] <oldlaptop> apotheon: It's unfortunate that RDBMSes have the worst of both worlds in that SQL has won so comprehensively that it isn't really practical politics to experiment with different language designs, but they still all differ enough that interoperability is painful

[12:06:22] <merijn> It's mostly that I've done a bunch of GPU matrix/image processing stuff and 2D convolutions are, like, the most basic element of any of those. And convolutions are like hammers, when you've got one, every problem looks like a nail ;)

[14:38:58] <ProfSimm> It's interesting when you have async technically there's no simple way to transmit 1 and 0. It's just 1, which comes at arbitrary times.
[14:39:14] <ProfSimm> Of course you can still encode info that way.
[14:39:24] <ProfSimm> Say by sending an impulse alongside different paths
[14:39:25] <GeDaMo> it's 1 or 0 with an enable signal :P

[20:54:16] <Pickchea> Hey, I have an array of posterior probabilities and a function computing them. How should I call them to avoid name conflicts? `posteriors = posteriors_fn(...)' or `posteriors_arr = posteriors(...)'? I don't really like function names like `calculate_posteriors' or `get_posteriors' or something. Sounds so procedural, doesn't match the rest of my code.

[20:58:23] <austincheney> Pickchea, my recommendation for identifiers is: 1) uniquness within a limited context of availability, 2) a name that is meaningful yet concise.  Don't over think naming, as code identifiers can be arbitrarily changed later.  Data identifiers require more refactoring to change

[21:01:45] <oldlaptop> if the reason it's not is that the language would make that inconvenient, I suppose an ugly name matches that ugly situation. If the reason is that repeated references to the function would be inefficient, I would think something involving "_cache" is a pretty meaningful and concise explanation of why it exists.

[21:35:51] <pyzozord> problem with gold as a store of value that it's essentially useless
[21:35:52] <vdamewood> I googled and did some math, 20kg of gold would be about 1036 cubic centimeters.

[23:00:09] <[-_-]> wait, it may not have to, just cause there is update doesn't mean I have to print it
[23:00:15] <InPhase> [-_-]: Okay.  There are two ways to do this.  One is the simple way that will be appealing to "I am not a CS student" which is to not do it at all the way you're planning, and instead just make a single routine that decides which of these to check at each loop based on how much time has passed since the last time it was checked.
[23:00:15] <GeDaMo> Why doesn't loop1 just read memory and battery and print everything out?
[23:00:39] <vms14> [-_-]: then you want async stuff?
[23:00:45] <[-_-]> o.o
[23:01:01] <[-_-]> GeDaMo: then I don't need loop0
[23:01:10] <GeDaMo> How often do you want to print out?
[23:01:20] <InPhase> [-_-]: The way a software engineer ideally approaches this scenario with true parallelism is to setup a multithreaded system with event loops where some of the event loops are running timers to poll the information, and they send update messages to the display thread.
[23:01:20] <[-_-]> that is also a variable
[23:01:25] <vms14> I've made a package in perl to simplify loops
[23:02:03] <vms14> you just write the whole process in lines and it takes every line and wraps it inside a function that will execute one line every time is called
