[03:19:50] <Irishmanluke> It's very hard to argue without appealing to intuition but I have succesfully walked people through a line of reasoning that causes their intuitions to line up with mine when previously they hadn't
[03:21:02] <inhahe_> Well, I'm curious about your argument.
[03:23:15] *** Joins: medium_cool (~medium_co@2605:a601:a9aa:f800:68c6:1034:8cf9:5a2d)
[03:23:32] <Irishmanluke> Well I guess I would start by pointing out that any materialist theories of consciousness that have been put forth so far really only address the physical correlates of consciousness and don't contain within them any implication that what they're defining as consciousness ought to actually imply the existence of experience, in other words they fail to address the hard problem
[03:25:19] <Irishmanluke> This I think is what started moving me in this direction, when I was in college thinking about consciousness this fact bothered me a lot and the more that I thought about it the more convinced I became that this wasn't just a failing of the theories that had been put forth so far but a failing of the materialist framework in general
[03:28:47] <Irishmanluke> I realize there's a lot of overlap here but any theory that applies to emergence also carries with it the same flaw to me.  I think I understand emergence fairly well and what emergence can't really do is cause a fundamentally different type of phenomena to pop into existence.  In the case of emergence higher level phenomena really are just an abstract way of conceiving of the ineractions
[03:28:53] <Irishmanluke> between a bunch of lower level phenomena.  It's not clear at all how this sort of thing could help explain the existence of experience
[03:32:19] <Irishmanluke> Like a game of life pattern clearly is just a way of conceiving of a bunch of cells turning on and off in a particular order.  The idea that for instance the sensation of happiness really is equivalent to some pattern within he brain just doesn't make sense on its face

[05:12:17] <causative_> there's a world of difference between being uncertain about something, and saying it's just a matter of opinion or subjectivity
[05:12:37] <causative_> to say you are uncertain is to admit first that there *is* some truth of the matter, and some chance that your belief is *wrong* by failing to match the truth of the matter
[05:13:31] <causative_> the possibility of being wrong is what distinguishes mere opinion from substantive claims

[07:22:10] <kish`> mycroftiv, what is that in english
[07:22:59] <mycroftiv> kish`: ok explosions in chemistry are molecular rearrangements releasing energy i think
[07:23:16] <mycroftiv> like that guys famous blog posts 'sand wont save you this time'
[07:23:30] <mycroftiv> sand may save us this time, but thats another story
[07:24:04] <mycroftiv> but society and economy is also like a complicated molecule, and our socioeconomic patterns might recrystallize their arrangement
[07:24:32] <mycroftiv> this could have 'explosive' effects on the organizational level it exists on, just like molecular chemical rearrangements cause literal explosive effects
[07:25:05] <mycroftiv> effective processes of change that are not harmful have to control potentially exothermic reactions
[07:25:34] <mycroftiv> you dont really want to liberate an uncontrolled amount of energy too fast in a small volume of spacetime, or explode peoples brains with ideas too radical to assimilate
[07:26:11] <mycroftiv> being a catalytic agent for change requires awareness of the thermodynamic properties of the recrystallization and reharmonization processes in an intelligent way
[07:26:39] <mycroftiv> and as powerful as 'chain reactions' are, they are also quite dangerous if they go supercritical and reach Trinity or something
[07:27:17] <mycroftiv> ive been pushing my whole life on a lot of boundaries and borders and thinking about how to dismantle some fences
[07:28:00] <mycroftiv> amazingly i think im at the place now where just my tools of thought and communication may have the catalytic ability to dissolve certain fences and initiate catalytic reactions of change in peoples minds
[07:28:36] <mycroftiv> but i realize that to whatever extent this power of communication of ideas and potential for acting as a seed crystal is\
[07:28:36] <mycroftiv> \
[07:29:33] <mycroftiv> sorry, mistake type. to whatever extent ideas for the possible change to society at this moment are realizable, the exothermic properties of this kind of alchemy has to be considered carefully
[07:29:59] <mycroftiv> the lothlorien coop is probably a kind of alchemical vessel for a test reaction
[07:30:44] <mycroftiv> where we can see if this alchemical recrystallization has desirable properties and its information can replicate and the exothermic proprties (or endothemric inputs!) are workable

[07:42:50] <kish`> mycroftiv, i'd like to see the toppling of a liberal democracy
[07:43:15] <mycroftiv> kish`: if by 'toppling' we mean 'the system changes and a different and better one emerges' then yeah lets do that
[07:43:27] <mycroftiv> language is so ambiguous
[07:43:43] <mycroftiv> one person says 'toppling' and is maybe thinking a happy joyous shared cooperative process
[07:43:58] <mycroftiv> another hears they might be the thing getting toppled
[07:44:20] <mycroftiv> if toppling is happening people usually want to be the topplers and not the topplees
[07:44:31] <mycroftiv> or of they are gonna get toppled, theyd like a soft landing
[07:45:03] <mycroftiv> so toppling is really interesting, my city madison wisconsin had some statue toppling recently and i generally kinda support the spirit, but the execution was kinda buggy maybe
[07:45:28] <mycroftiv> you really want to know exactly what you are toppling and why and what the consequences will be as much as possible
[07:46:03] <mycroftiv> some kind of plan for what will be erected in place of that which needed to be toppled
[07:46:59] <mycroftiv> this is why to me, the detailed mathematical-chemical analysis of the structural molecules of society and calculation of a catalytic change reaction is a more detailed metaphor than just a topple
[07:47:37] <mycroftiv> studying the stories of revolutionary change movements of the past and their effects on history is vital to make new ones, cliche cliche but so it goes
[07:48:18] <mycroftiv> the model of 'leave the machine the same, just knock the controller out of the seat and put a new controller in' or 'break the machine and build a better one' or what it is exactly
[07:49:00] <mycroftiv> somehow 'make the machine grow organically yet rapidly to a new shape and offer new collaborative control mechanisms' is a bit metaphorically complex and indirect but its more the spirit that is ultimately needed perhaps
[07:49:34] <mycroftiv> any feedback?

[10:51:35] <iryith> mycroftiv, do you have a background in mathematics?
[10:56:57] <mycroftiv> iryith: ive learned a lot of mathematics yes, not sure what 'background' is though
[10:57:23] <mycroftiv> but at this point i feel very comfortable with formal logic and mathematics of the infinite especially, ultrafilters
[10:58:18] <mycroftiv> iryith: are there any particular mathematical topics you were going to mention? im very interested
[10:59:08] <iryith> no no, I was just wondering why you were always trying to tie together everything into a mathematical construct
[10:59:41] <mycroftiv> iryith: to make things practical and doable from an engineering point of view
[10:59:56] <mycroftiv> its just like medicine - we do statistical trials to measure what medicine is helpful and effective
[11:00:13] <mycroftiv> the mathematics is just a tool to try to achieve good outcomes, however we wish to define good
[11:00:30] *** Quits: ttree (~ttree0@c-73-97-116-42.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[11:00:41] <iryith> mathematics would be a good tool to define a desirable outcome, but the implementation of it would probably be impossible
[11:01:02] <mycroftiv> we already have this implementation, its our economy of dollars and cents mostly
[11:01:14] <mycroftiv> its kind of buggy, but better than just shouting BRING ME BEANS at the world
[11:01:44] <mycroftiv> we can improve this real world decision making mechanism with mathematics and software
[11:02:08] <mycroftiv> we are already in the procecess of doing this continuously in government and banking, but that proceess is controlled by social software called 'laws'
[11:02:17] <mycroftiv> as well as language-cultural practices
[11:02:27] <mycroftiv> the de facto law of our day to day conduct
[11:03:12] <mycroftiv> by understanding what it means to be kind and loving and open and sharing, and projecting this pattern in a replicating and self-sustaining way into the living networks of information, we make our garden healthier and more diverse
[11:03:48] <mycroftiv> its not really any more mathematical than the idea of constant practice of loving compassion and mutual listening to needs
[11:04:05] <mycroftiv> and trying to collaborate to achieve that with best-effort
[11:05:23] <mycroftiv> if one person has two slices of cake and the other person has 1 when there was an agreement to share, the person with less may point this out, and the response 'why do you have to make it about math and numbers?' is kinda not the point
[11:05:57] <mycroftiv> its just trying to share the cake fairly, and for that matter figure out how to bake it deliciously, and write down the recipe and share it with others
[11:07:11] <mycroftiv> accomplishing these real world goals effectively, which are only 'about' math in the sense that information and transmission of information through time in symbolic form and description of physical data like quantity7 and baking time and temp is needed
[11:08:18] <mycroftiv> its nice if we dont have to think too hard about mathy stuff all the time if we dont want to
[11:08:39] <mycroftiv> its great if you can just bake the cake and let everyone take all they wish and the chef operates on love and feel and theres plenty
[11:09:08] <mycroftiv> but in the real world, you dont want to waste ingredients, you need to know how many people are gonna show up to the party since cake for 5 and cake for 50 is different
[11:09:56] <mycroftiv> lot of stuff goes into throwing a fun party, and a bit of math can help even if its not a Math Party
[11:10:34] <mycroftiv> im just volunteering to do what i can as volunteer for the party planning committee
[11:11:02] <mycroftiv> which is mostly kinda on the math side since i dont dance too well and my fingers cant play piano any more really, so some math and words and code it is
[11:14:06] <Ungwelian> The problem with math is that it's essentially abbreviations. And that masks demarcation problems underneath.
[11:14:17] <Ungwelian> Especially in social issues this can be dehumanizing.
[11:16:04] <iryith> well, it's also intangible in most social applications. I'm trying to tie together reality with what mycroftiv just said, but it seems to me to just be a conglomeration of ideas that don't really jive together
[11:17:51] <mycroftiv> iryith: well im working in actual reality to make it real in my daily life currently
[11:18:12] <mycroftiv> with all the value i have managed and am managing to create in the world, and all the connections i have
[11:18:38] <iryith> sure, but you made those contacts and the change on a social level, not from a mathematical construct
[11:18:42] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: please help me make sure to not behave or contribute to anything dehumanizing, although allowing us to merge and unmerge freely with AI minds and stuff seems cool
[11:18:55] <mycroftiv> iryith: isnt the internet and computers 'made of math' ?
[11:19:09] <mycroftiv> i lived in a completely different world as a child without cellphones and stuff
[11:19:28] <mycroftiv> and it is mathematics made into technology and software structuring communication that have radically changed my actual life and world
[11:19:53] <mycroftiv> i am trying to work to make those software structures that control my life have a mathematical structure which is less harmful to me
[11:20:28] <mycroftiv> because the power they given the corps and governments without giving me equal power, and the benefits they give to others by taking from me without giving me benefit, is unfair, and this is mathematical as i stated in analogy with cake
[11:22:07] <kmh> you betcha
[11:22:15] <kmh> tech has turned evil
[11:22:30] <kmh> mostly thanks to greed and lobbyism
[11:22:55] <Ungwelian> mycroftiv, no worries. This kinda came to mind because I'm just filling a medical form :)
[11:22:58] <iryith> I'm sure the metaverse will turn out just fine.....

[20:16:23] <Delf> To NOT fuck someone up is different than providing a helping hand for someone that is doing things they should not

[20:20:19] <Delf> Lets address the second one. Honesty. This one is heavy also. But it's more of a way of modulating the way you share your opinions and thoughts
[20:21:32] <Delf> Suppose I make music, and it sucks horse shit. Will you admit to me that it sucks shit? If I'm a valued friend of yours

[20:23:18] <arryana> you'll already know if it sucks shit.  why would anyone have to tell you?
[20:23:20] <Delf> So you value your own honesty above my feelings? You will deny me happiness?
[20:23:21] <mycroftiv> but i know enough about music to give you a reason why some might consider it good, rather than a claim it is somehow inherently bad
[20:23:54] <mycroftiv> even if i dislike it myself personally. i dont like Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker at all, but its one of the most popular pieces in the repertoire
[20:25:30] <Delf> arryana: Lets pretend I think my music doesn't suck shit because I like it. I have a shit for taste of music. Will you admit?
[20:26:04] <arryana> if it's something i don't like, i admit if i don't like it.  but that has nothing to do with how inherently 'good' it is.
[20:26:18] <arryana> my other half and i have totally different musical tastes.  that doesn't mean his 'suck shit'
[20:26:32] <Delf> Good/bad is totally opinion oriented when it comes to music, is it not?

[20:32:42] <Delf> Fuck it, bad example. The point is to demonstrate that honesty can be problematic
[20:34:00] <arryana> not as problematic as dishonesty

[22:30:30] <Delf> Prove them wrong how?
[22:30:58] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[22:31:26] <xx> that even those 4 parts of the bible contain things that are either factually incorrect, or greatly inconsistent with each other, or inconsistent with what jesus is usually represented as teaching
[22:31:51] <xx> but I'd have to do that without any reference to any other parts of the bible
[22:32:01] <xx> which is a challenge
[22:32:12] <Delf> They believe in the archetype of jesus thy christ?
[22:32:51] <Delf> My uncle believes in christ but he does not consider himself christian
[22:32:53] <xx> I guess. It's hard to say what they believe, if they only pick those 4 parts.
[22:33:28] <Delf> Irrespective of the sources of that archetype, it's an honorable one, is it not?

[22:33:48] <xx> I don't really see honor as something worthy of consideration
[22:35:46] <Delf> So now we know why you want to find religious channel and also how you want to prove them wrong. The following question is why do you want to prove them wrong?
[22:36:08] <xx> because they said "Prove me wrong, you can't"
[22:36:38] <xx> they fully reject the rest of the bible, saying it is inconsistent, hearsay, written by other authors, ...
[22:36:55] <Delf> Well, in your game, you might prove them wrong. In their game, they can simply disregard any proof you provide as inadequate, setting you up for a no win scenario
[22:36:56] <xx> so it would be nice to show that even those 4 parts they hold dear are also full of the same problems
[22:37:25] <xx> well at least it would prompt them to find better arguments
[22:38:19] <Delf> What is the nature of your communication medium with them?
[22:38:21] <xx> all the online resources from the typical atheist or whatever sources deal with issues from the entire bible, and not just the specific parts
[22:38:42] <xx> Delf: internet, but I know them in person
[22:39:13] <Delf> Do you think they're capable of having a decent conversation in good faith, without souring your relationship?
[22:40:03] <xx> yes
[22:40:11] <xx> but I also don't really care if I lose them as a friend
[22:40:15] <xx> I have enough friends
[22:40:20] <Delf> :)
[22:40:36] <Delf> Strength in numbers eh
[22:40:56] <xx> having enough friends is great because it means one is not forced to endure shitty friendships
[22:41:25] <Delf> That's not even a necessity
[22:41:40] <xx> it's not necessary, but helps
[22:41:43] <Delf> You can have 0 friends and still not be forced to endure shitty friendships
[22:41:50] <xx> indeed
[22:42:28] <xx> yeah if anyone could point me in the right direction regarding my search for knowledge, that'd be great
[22:42:40] <xx> I don't particularly want to read the bible myself and try to find issues in it
[22:43:02] <Delf> Consult atheists who are well versed in the subject if you're looking for ammo
[22:43:53] <xx> I don't know any atheists
[22:44:09] <Delf> None of your friends are atheists?
[22:44:31] <xx> religion doesn't ever come up, so I don't know
[22:44:45] <xx> religion doesn't even play any part in my life either
[22:44:52] <xx> but I don't know if that's what atheism means
[22:45:43] <Delf> It's nice to know the religious affiliations of your friends
[22:46:02] *** Warbarz_ is now known as Warbarz
[22:46:05] <Delf> Some are encouraged by their religion to cut your head off, for example. You might want to avoid those
[22:46:29] <xx> given that they never mentioned it, I'd guess I'm fine
[22:46:55] <Delf> Clearly your head is where it's supposed to be
[22:47:10] <Delf> Know thy friends!
[22:47:22] <xx> nah, knowing your enemies is more important
[22:47:32] <Delf> I know exactly which friends to ask for help... when moving and which to ask for help when moving bodies
[22:48:06] <xx> all my friends would help me move bodies
[22:48:15] <Delf> Hahahh :D
[22:48:16] <xx> nobody really likes the gov
[22:49:16] <Delf> Have you heard the saying, friends help you move and real friends help you move bodies. I find it funny :)
[22:50:38] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[22:51:42] <xx> I don't make a big distinction between furniture and bodies
[22:51:58] <xx> I'm sure they had their reasons, and it's not like I'm gonna run to the gov to tell on them
[22:52:38] <xx> they should make duels a thing again
[22:55:35] <xx> best I can find is that there are those stories about walking on water and creating lots of food from some fish and bread. They could claim that those are metaphors, so I'd need to find something in the gospels that they consider as literal truth and ask them why they pick that part as literal truth and other parts as metaphors.
[22:55:58] <xx> I just need to find some crazy stuff in the gospels now that christians commonly take as literal truth
[22:57:15] <Delf> Thing is, most benevolent people are at a severe disadvantage so granting super powers to a benevolent character is kind of nice
[22:58:45] <Delf> It brings some kind of missing balance

[23:22:22] <Delf> If they're being benevolent because they believe in some benevolent character with super powers then it's best to let them. Better than having no reason to be benevolent
[23:22:49] <I_Am_M00t> what is this word "benevolent"?
[23:23:00] <Delf> Look it up, you might like it
[23:23:05] <I_Am_M00t> is this a mythological tale?
