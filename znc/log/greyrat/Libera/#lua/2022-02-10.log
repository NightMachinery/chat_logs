[04:18:00] <nmz> https://termbin.com/92av
[04:18:03] <jaawerth> it just resolves the path, so you can do your own loading or for debugging the resolution ago

[04:19:12] <jaawerth> oh you mean loadall. I dunno what tht does
[04:19:55] <jaawerth> oh make sure your package path and cpath don't have any paths that lack a ?. that will cause it to resolve *every* module to that path
[04:20:21] <jaawerth> oh loadall is ust the catchall
[04:22:47] <jaawerth> anyway if you installed it with luarocks maybe try `eval $(luarocks path)` first to get all the loader stuff set up. if otherwise.. maybe more knowledgable peole than me have suggestsions
[04:25:04] <nmz> I managed to get it to load now, but now it gives an error, probably because its trying to load the lua5. whatever library.
[04:25:27] <jaawerth> it's in your 5.4 path though. and you're presumably on 5.4
[04:25:29] <jaawerth> how did you install it?
[04:25:38] <nmz> luarocks
[04:26:30] <nmz> but I had to configured it to use the 5.3 headers, and I was hoping using --lua-version would be enough for luarocks to install correctly
[04:26:57] <jaawerth> the 5.3 headers? hrm
[04:27:22] <jaawerth> --lua-version usually does it but I dunno what impact the headers would be. sounds sus though
[04:27:42] <jaawerth> fwiw lfs is also on a lot of distro package managers

[04:50:44] <jaawerth> well, those are def some god poiints. and it drives me nuts that it holds so many things to 5.1 without even icnludin compat patches like __pairs
[04:51:01] <jaawerth> py5pyfurious
[04:51:41] <q66> pretty sure it still has this corruption bug that randomly shows up on large codebases that nobody will ever fix because it's impossible to isolate or reliably reproduce
[04:52:24] <q66> it's real fun when your application segfaults about once in 40 runs and changing as little as a comment in the lua code makes it stop happening
[04:53:05] <q66> have fun debugging mike's spaghetti assembly
[04:53:15] <jaawerth> oh. I think I hit that once in the a fennel compiler patch and I got real confused because I absolutely could not isolate the repro. but that ws on, like, 2.0beta3 or something and I haven't seen it since. but to your poit it's indeterminate to begin with, so hard to say
[04:53:58] <tumn> I have a friend who works with luajit who figured out the mysterious segfault problem while working on a big project
[04:54:21] <jaawerth> on the other hand I end up using it a lot due to other things I use that leverage and it and it usually just works

[10:23:25] <tumn> it's not debian's fault
[10:24:00] <tumn> debian follow a very particular release cycle and philosophy for package updates that has high demand in people running sensitive systems like servers that can't break under any circumstance
[10:24:33] <tumn> if u knew the amount of work that went into a 3 year debian release I don't think you would hold that sentiment anymore
[10:25:45] <tumn> it's not just a matter of being slow, as security patches are delivered extremely quickly, usually the same day for disclosure of critical bugs
[10:26:10] <tumn> check out the debian wiki for more info, particularly a page called DontBreakDebian if you are installing programs manually, since that's actually a really bad idea
[10:26:33] <furq> testing finally updated luarocks and made it not unusable
[10:26:37] <furq> at least as far as i can tell from the path notes
[10:26:40] <furq> c
[10:27:05] <tumn> good reason to wait for debian 12 then
[10:27:44] <furq> why wait when you can install it now
[10:28:00] <tumn> eh actually you're right
[10:28:04] <tumn> but..
[10:28:28] <tumn> well testing is okay for desktop systems I guess that don't need security patches and guaranteed compatibility quite as fast
[10:28:38] <tumn> but I usually wouldn't recommend it 
[10:28:50] <furq> i would always recommend testing unless it's a production server or something
[10:29:08] <tumn> I recommend stable or oldstable 
[10:29:09] <furq> certainly since the gtk3 guys stopped breaking everything constantly
[10:29:13] <tumn> stuff done on testing won't always translate to a production server

[10:29:46] <furq> huh
[10:30:00] <nmz> I remember running backported pidgin, why? because pidgin broke all the time because protocols change
[10:30:57] <tumn> nmz: assuming u are on the stable branch, I would bet money that the reason u experience most breakages because of what the debian wiki calls Shiny New Stuff Syndrome, and not because of debian's release methodology
[10:31:18] <furq> well it is because of debian's release methodology
[10:31:27] <furq> specifically that he picked the wrong one
[10:31:49] <tumn> stable is the correct branch for debian
[10:31:59] <tumn> if you need to use testing or unstable u need a different distro
[10:32:01] <furq> if you want new stuff then use a rolling distro

[10:34:29] <tumn> I would also say debian really isn't designed to support users who are using federated stuff (like pidgin + xmpp) that is constantly going through protocol changes and needs to be on the bleeding edge to work with other peoples systems
[10:34:56] <tumn> although xmpp is pretty stagnant so that problem surprises me
[10:35:38] <tumn> but yea if u need that, trying to shove it into a debian system destroys all of debian's strengths and makes the system pretty much useless

[10:40:51] <tumn> or just has a bunch of systems running the same version of debian

[13:16:42] <MattJ> tumn, XMPP is far from stagnant, but Pidgin's XMPP support pretty much has been for a decade. There's hope we may see some improvement there, but Debian's release cycle isn't much to do with that.
[13:18:13] <MattJ> It happens that Pidgin will still work with 99% of XMPP servers, because XMPP doesn't break backwards compatibility needlessly, however Pidgin misses out on a whole load of modern improvements
[13:19:43] <MattJ> The state of Lua 5.4 support in current Debian stable is... less than ideal
[13:21:49] <MattJ> It's now fixed for the next version, just a shame that's another year or two away

[17:55:07] <MattJ> tochigi, as an upstream developer I have those problems :)
[17:55:31] <MattJ> Since Fedora does not support the range of Lua versions that Debian does
[17:55:36] <tochigi> go downstream
[18:00:18] <MattJ> One reason we are keeping 5.1 support so long is because Fedora only lets you choose 5.1 or 5.4. Probably our next release will target 5.4, but by then Fedora may have dropped it.

[20:22:55] <technomancy> that's real bad
[20:23:16] <MattJ> The "X is dead" statement can, I think, be applied to anything that's not the trendy thing of the moment, no matter how many people are actually using or depending on it.
[20:23:47] <MattJ> This includes Lua, and definitely IRC. Probably most Linux distributions qualify as "dead" too :)
[20:24:29] <Elw3> what did they do?
[20:26:04] <MattJ> Elw3, Fedora? As I noted above, they don't support multiple Lua versions. They have 5.1 (as "lua-compat") and a "lua" package that generally tracks the latest Lua release.

[21:58:41] <technomancy> the modern web is capitalism having found a technical loophole in the fact that all the specs are open in that it's impossible for non-corporate humans to implement them because they're way too complex.
[22:04:25] <Albright> I think that's what the Gemini people are trying to fix. They just tend to all come off as a bit fanatical for some reason.
[22:09:34] <technomancy> "for some reason" could be because their manifesto is explicitly glorifying being exclusionary and elitist, who'd have thought
[22:17:28] <Albright> I think you could get pretty far by specifying out a subset of HTTP/1.0 with (optional?) TLS where the main content-type is text/markdown. That way existing web server daemons could be used along with existing HTTP connection libraries and Markdown parsers/renderers for clients. Gemini chooses to reinvent wheels though.
[22:18:33] <technomancy> yep! all the technology is there and very easy to use already; the point of gemini is it's gratuitously incompatible.
[22:19:30] <technomancy> rfc 1866; do you speak it?
[22:20:09] <Albright> Well, I get wanting to avoid HTML due to its complexity, but sure, a strict subset of that could work as well.
[22:20:17] <Albright> I find Markdown more pleasant to write though.
[22:20:50] <technomancy> HTML 5 is complicated; HTML 4 is complicated. HTML 2 is suuuuper easy.
[22:21:44] <technomancy> half the RFC is just sgml shit you can ignore
[22:29:22] <Albright> Bruh
[22:29:27] <Albright> I'm falling in love with my own idea here
[22:29:37] <Albright> It's going to my head.
[22:30:05] <Albright> Might have to try to spec it out if I can find the time.
[22:30:55] <technomancy> serving markdown over HTTP you mean?
[22:31:30] <Albright> A subset of HTTP, yes
[22:31:43] <technomancy> it's not a bad idea if you just prefer markdown; it's just silly to say there's no simple way to do HTML
[22:32:39] <Albright> Well, MD itself is basically a subset of HTML, right?
[22:33:08] <Albright> Like, forget styling, forget JS, let's just make a document here.
[22:33:10] <technomancy> you can dump HTML directly into MD so it sounds more like a superset
[22:33:55] <technomancy> aaaand then you get into the other problem with markdown; its official definition is a pile of perl regexps. =P
[22:33:56] <Albright> In theory. In practice many implementations don't let you do that.
[22:34:05] <technomancy> I guess you probably actually want commonmark?
[22:34:10] <Albright> Well, yes.
