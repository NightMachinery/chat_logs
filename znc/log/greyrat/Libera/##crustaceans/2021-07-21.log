[08:50:29] <jjuran> I use nearlyfreespeech.net
[08:50:58] <jjuran> So, today I bought a Thunderbolt cable
[08:51:29] <jjuran> I figured 2m (over 6.5 feet) was overkill, so I got a smaller one
[08:52:28] <jjuran> But the only smaller option was 0.5m, or 1.6 feet, and I failed to consider how short that was
[08:52:49] <jjuran> Why there's no 1.0m option, I have no idea
[08:54:50] <jjuran> The laptop I'm vacating has keyboard problems, including a dead T key
[08:55:10] <jjuran> But the OS still works, so I was able to reboot into Target Disk Mode
[08:55:41] <jjuran> Oh, and unlike the Mac Mini, it ignores external keyboards at boot
[08:56:20] <jjuran> Because you can just use the internal keyboard, right?
[08:56:27] <jjuran> The one that fails and can't be replaced
[08:56:31] <drakonis> o dang
[08:56:38] <drakonis> i wanna play some morrowind online now
[08:58:04] <jjuran> The Linux installer I tried has Thunderbolt support and I can see the Mac show up under /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices, but no new /dev/sd* files appear
[08:58:39] <jjuran> I thought maybe rebooting would help, but it booted off the target-disk-mode machine instead of the USB flash drive
[08:58:59] <jjuran> And holding down Option didn't give me the option (to boot off USB)
[09:00:09] <jjuran> So I'm booting from the Recovery partition over Thunderbolt and using dd in Terminal to copy the main partition

[13:09:06] <quanticle> Eh, I'm not that concerned about joyrides. After all, if a joyride is leaving debris up there, something has gone very wrong.
[13:09:39] <quanticle> So people are going to take precautions so that they themselves don't end up as part of said debris field
[13:10:03] <quanticle> To me Starlink is a way bigger threat that some Bezos rockets (which aren't even orbital yet)
[13:10:25] <Brekkjern> I'm no more fan of Starlink though
[13:11:07] <quanticle> Yeah, I was responding to the "now space, too has been ruined by capitalism"
[13:11:27] <quanticle> It's like, dude, space was ruined by capitalism the moment they lauched Telstar 1
[13:11:30] <quanticle> In the '60s
[13:11:39] <quanticle> A bit late for you to be noticing now
[13:12:08] <Brekkjern> The only redeeming factor for Starlink is that they are in such a low, unstable orbit that they can't really contribute much to the kessler syndrome unless you hit one and yeet it into a higher orbit
[13:13:07] <gerikson> starlink sucks because it's essentially gov-subsidised pollution
[13:13:18] <quanticle> How is Starlink government subsidized?
[13:13:40] <gerikson> aren't the launches subsidized?
[13:13:42] <gerikson> maybe not
[13:13:45] <gerikson> *shrug*
[13:14:12] <quanticle> I mean, when it comes to government subsidized space pollution, my first thought is Iridium
[13:14:25] <gerikson> if a Kessler event happened, what would be the real world implications? Woudl it knock out GPS?
[13:14:28] <quanticle> Which was bailed out by the US government because the CIA and DoD found it so useful
[13:14:44] <quanticle> They couldn't let it go bankrupt when it turned out that approximately no one else actually needed a satellite phone
[13:14:54] <gerikson> lol
[13:15:40] <quanticle> re: Kessler syndrome, it depends on which altitudes are sprayed with debris
[13:15:53] <quanticle> The big concern is that it makes it impossible to launch new satellites
[13:16:04] <quanticle> Because they'd have to cross this field of high-speed shrapnel
[13:17:12] <quanticle> So even if everything is fine for the moment, eventually GPS degrades and dies because the existing satellites wear out and it's impossible to launch new ones to replace them.
[13:19:13] <Brekkjern> I'd imagine anything in geostationary orbit would be somewhat safe from kessler syndrome as they are practically motionless in comparison to each other
[13:19:28] <Brekkjern> Not sure if GPS is in geostationary though
[13:19:57] <gerikson> I think they're in LEO but I dunno
[13:20:32] <Brekkjern> GEO would give bad coverage in many places of earth, so I'd imagine so, yeah
[13:24:05] <Brekkjern> RE sattelites: I worked a place where we had a rented connection over satelite from Norway to the Middle East, and the users were complaining about latency over that link (citrix, yay...). The upper manglement ordered the network team to make it better, but it's not like you can speed up the signal any more. It's already moving at C, so not much to do there. They explained that this was physically impossible, and the only solution would be to
[13:24:05] <Brekkjern> reduce the travel distance for the signal. With satelite that would mean lowering the orbits. The manglement answered with "Great! Do that!"
[13:29:26] <quanticle> GPS is in MEO
[13:29:34] <quanticle> Between LEO and geostationary
[13:29:54] <quanticle> Heh "manglement
[13:30:02] <quanticle> What an appropriate typo
[13:30:11] <Brekkjern> Not a typo :P
[13:30:53] *** Joins: mercerist (~mercerist@user/mercerist)
[13:31:31] <quanticle> Lol
[13:31:53] <quanticle> I think the correct thing to do in that case is to just lie
[13:32:22] <quanticle> "Yep, we did it" "What? No, whatever you did didn't work" "Oh, okay, well, let me see hmmm... well, let's try something else <go away for a week>"
[13:32:30] <quanticle> rinse and repeat until they forget
[13:32:42] <quanticle> Or until some other priority comes up
[13:33:06] <quanticle> "Oh, yes, I did look into that, but Project Alpha is a priority, don't you agree?"
[13:33:41] <Brekkjern> The solution is to either deploy a new citrix server closer to the users, or to give them standalone machines and pipe their network over that connection instead.
[13:33:56] <Brekkjern> Pitch the ball back to the server ops :P
[13:34:07] <quanticle> Yeah, that works too.
[13:34:14] <quanticle> Not my problem.
[13:34:35] <Brekkjern> exactly :P
[13:44:33] <pja> GPS is LEO IIRC. The constellation of visible satellites is changing all the time.
[13:45:12] <pja> (ah, quanticle says MEO, sure.)
[13:45:21] <pja> Not goestationary anyway.
[13:45:30] <pja> gooey stationary?
[13:47:44] <quanticle> Yeah, GPS can't be geostationary, because you need multiple orbital planes in order to get enough coverage over the earth.
[13:48:18] <quanticle> So even if you launched them high enough to have a 24-hour orbital period, they still wouldn't be *stationary*
[13:58:00] <epilys> because multiple geostationaries would be more expensive, right?
[13:58:06] <epilys> more in quantity
[13:58:25] <quanticle> Well, no, it's because a geostationary orbit is only stationary if it's above the equator
[13:58:39] <quanticle> If you incline an orbit at that altitude, it's no longer geostationary
[13:59:03] <epilys> can't you "see" the entire hemisphere from the equator?
[13:59:12] <epilys> on these altitudes
[13:59:31] <quanticle> It would be a pretty poor GPS if it only worked when you had a view south
[13:59:42] <quanticle> (Or north if you were in the southern hemisphere

[14:26:53] <quanticle> Yeah, I'm just thinking like 20 years from now
[14:26:59] <epilys> I first found out about this book while reading about orbital mechanics after playing Kerbal Space Program (back when it was first released)
[14:27:17] <epilys> then some years later I was working at the university library and a professor donated a bunch of books including this
[14:27:18] <quanticle> Is KSP 2.0 out yet?
[14:27:25] <epilys> haven't played since then quanticle
[14:27:26] <epilys> no idea
[14:27:50] <epilys> anyway, the library was about electrical engineering so I suggested it was worthless for the library and took it afterwards..
[14:27:54] <quanticle> Ah, same. I haven't played it in years, because my desktop died and my laptop is too potato
[14:28:17] <epilys> if potatos could mine bitcoin, we would have a potato famine
[14:28:28] <quanticle> But I will be upgrading my laptop soon, so maybe that book will come in handy
[14:29:36] <epilys> iirc it is considered a "classic"
[14:32:24] <quanticle> Also, wrt "printlexia" I suppose I should find it heartening that the market share of e-books has basically stabilized.
