[00:44:25] <bruda> hexnewbie: heh yea that I can imagine. Though by time I was downloading Linux ISO's I had finally got cable internet. So it wasn't as miserable of a loss.
[00:45:07] <jiffe> configuring auditd to log everything I think this will be very useful along with what I'm logging from the signal handler
[00:45:12] <nabblet> keir: the later... or at least that´s what I think I need. atm I jsut end up with an unsorted collection of files with notes of arbitrary quality.

[03:22:56] <bruda> Typically the keys are for outgoing ssh connections in my experience. So if the client machines pub is added to the 'authorized_keys' file the clients should be able to connect. The known_hosts file is usually related to outgoing ssh connections as well in my experience. Usually when connecting to a server it'll ask you to confirm the host or whatever.
[03:24:09] *** Joins: LogicAside (~LogicAsid@user/logicaside)
[03:24:10] <bruda> The .ssh directory and it's authorize_keys file should be in the home directory of whatever user being connected to on the server.

[03:31:45] <bruda> Ssh problems usually aren't too complicated though. If the right files are added to the systems you are trying to connect to ssh can usually find it's way through. But if there are other issues standing in the way then the problem is more complicated.

Either it's for interactive use, in which case the alias is the more informative answer, or it's for scripting, in which case why should take a closer look at why they think they need to record the path lookup at all. And if aliases are enabled in a script, the reasoning for that should be looked at even more closely.

[06:29:38] <keir> not that i've had it in years
[06:30:06] <BinarySavior> [[R]] I'm trying to set up nextcloud docker image, the environment variable I'm trying to set is NEXTCLOUD_TRUSTED_DOMAINS

[06:32:12] <sebastorama> BinarySavior: well.. by the name of this env var, it's just the domain to which your nextcloud deployment will accept and respond to
[06:32:52] <BinarySavior> sebastorama, that's what I initially thought, but I am getting:  Please contact your administrator. If you are an administrator, edit the "trusted_domains" setting in config/config.php like the example in config.sample.php.
[06:32:52] <BinarySavior> Further information how to configure this can be found in the documentation.
[06:33:04] <sebastorama> Could be really anything... If you set it to be "binarysavior.com" .. and you point a "decimalsavior.com" to your docker container, It will deny access
[06:33:25] <sebastorama> BinarySavior: well.. put the address to which you use in your browser to hit it
[06:34:30] <BinarySavior> sebastorama, yes exactly, I put "nc" as the trusted host in the docker-compose.yml file, then I edited my /etc/hosts file to add <nextcloud host ip> nc
[06:34:44] <BinarySavior> then i accessed from browser http://nc/

[06:42:49] <sebastorama> I'm really dumb at networking stuff
[06:43:23] <sebastorama> But my guess would be something like, since you setup a local name resolution for the address "nc", it's not getting picked up anywhere by your container
[06:43:36] <sebastorama> since your local machine is translating the address before sending the request
[06:43:50] <BinarySavior> it gets picked up by the packets
[06:43:50] <sebastorama> you need some reverse proxy telling your container "hey.. here's a request from nc.."

[07:58:55] <gorgonical_> I'm trying to make busybox work inside a virtual machine. I get a kernel panick from init dying because, presumably, the init script fails. The dmesg prints to ttyAMA0 fine, but I don't see output from busybox init. If I put an infinite wait either in the init script or in a super long sleep c program it won't kill init
[07:59:29] <a1> man, I thought they had mambo number 5 on the floppotron
[07:59:30] <gorgonical_> I've tried redirecting output to console, ttyAMA0, tty0, ttyS0, but I'm not getting anywhere. Is there something I should try? This exact busybox initramfs successfully boots the hypervisor
[07:59:47] <ayecee> how are you redirecting output
[08:00:01] <gorgonical_> in the init script it's just exec test > /dev/ttyAMA0 or whatever
[08:00:15] <gorgonical_> where test is naturally in the root of the initramfs
[08:00:51] <ayecee> have you set the console parameter when booting the kernel?
[08:01:35] <gorgonical_> No, but I could try setting console directly. I found out after setting it in the hypervisor that it was finicky and the default worked well
[08:01:41] <ayecee> like, console=ttyAMA0

[08:04:10] <ayecee> what do you use for a bootloader
[08:04:26] <gorgonical_> Currently it's all in qemu, but it's arm64 so u-boot into the hypervisor
[08:04:49] <gorgonical_> It does partially run on a pine64 too
[08:04:50] <ayecee> does the kernel support ttyAMA devices?
[08:05:11] <gorgonical_> Yeah. I get dmesg output for the entire boot sequence. Just when I try to drop into the /init process I lose output
[08:05:18] <ayecee> ah, i guess it must, otherwise the kernel messages wouldn't be there.
[08:05:19] <gorgonical_> This is all on qemu's serial port
[08:06:28] <ayecee> well shoot.
[08:07:08] <gorgonical_> The irony is that I have kdb running also but can't break into it via sysrq for some reason. I can't figure out how to make qemu send it, so I only get kdb after init panicks
[08:07:26] <gorgonical_> I tried installing gdb-multiarch but apparently 18.04 is so ancient that the gdb-multiarch doesn't know what "aarch64" is

[08:09:14] <gorgonical_> Evidently not, anyways
[08:10:12] <ayecee> i wonder if you'd need some devices in /dev pre-populated, before udev runs.

[12:48:19] <sunny93> hey guys I have a silly question. let's say I have a computer A behind a router  (public ip a.b.c.d and private ip 192.168.1.1). If computer A initiates a connection to the outside world e.g. www.google.com, when the ip packet comes back, and cross the router. What is the source ip address does my computer A see? Is it always 192.168.1.1, the
[12:48:19] <sunny93> router's private ip ?

[14:47:56] <mishugana> Hello folks, got some questions about alpine linux (posted this on the alpine-linux channel as well, awaiting response)
[14:49:02] <mishugana> I've got v3.15.0 (latest stable) and when I tried installing `fzf` (for example), it failed with an error saying that the package could not be found. I found that this package is available only on the `edge` tree, so I tried to upgrade to `edge` following the wiki page https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Upgrading_Alpine#Upgrading_to_Edge)
[14:49:06] *** Joins: tomato (~tomato@user/tomato)
[14:49:35] <mishugana> However, even after rebooting, I still find the version unchanged (3.15.0), and installation of some packages still fails with the same error. Anyone else face this? Something I'm doing wrong?
[14:49:52] *** Joins: AndroUser (~androirc@myyr.colleduc.ee)
[14:50:01] <rouji> you should probably upgrade all installed packages after you do that
[14:50:06] <mishugana> I'm using a macOS Host and using alpine-linux in `sys` (disk-backed) mode on VirtualBox
[14:50:27] <mishugana> rouji: Hey, I did that too - both the apk-tools and all the packages themselves.
[14:50:58] <mishugana> When I do `cat /etc/alpine-release`, I should see `edge` as per the wiki, but I still see `3.15.0`.
[14:51:13] <rouji> what does your /etc/apk/repositories look like?

[14:53:00] <mishugana> The wiki says `../edge/main`, but I could try out `.../edge/community` and see
[14:53:22] <rouji> fzf is in community, not main
[14:53:33] <rouji> you'll need *both*
[14:54:05] <mishugana> rouji: Hmmm

[18:23:44] <SpeakerToMeat> donax, I think he means something more akin to: for i in `find /a -type d -name "c"`;do find $i -type f -exec "rm {}";done
[18:24:01] <donax> the find command in the new toolset is actually quite versatile. But the main thing here is that the file you find can be selectively only regular files.

[18:27:13] <donax> SpeakerToMeat: Yes debnet answered so that I see there are some files in a (set of) "done" dirs which are to be manipulated (deleted)
[18:27:29] <donax> debnet: That can be done, indeed.
[18:27:32] <debnet> @donax Exactly, thanks for clarification.
[18:27:52] <SpeakerToMeat> donax, his use of **/c/* makes me think his structure is not static and he's trying to find all "done" subdirectories on a parent directory, and not necessarily at the first level even
[18:28:52] <donax> SpeakerToMeat: Yes, and that is also what I think now. Then nesting the find-commands is VERY useful.
[18:29:16] <donax> debnet: You must read the comments by SpeakerToMeat
[18:29:35] <debnet> Hum. My structure is always of that form: base/application/[done|todo|running]/<files>
[18:29:42] <SpeakerToMeat> It could probably even be nested by using just find and exec, but I've always had troubles working with complex things in exec so I avoid it if possible

[23:24:30] <ayecee> /proc/sys/kernel/printk controls the severity of messages that appear on the console, among other things. you could adjust that so they no longer appear, and see if you're satisfied with that.

[23:30:42] <gajus> the base VM is 20GB+. `docker save` is taking about 12 minutes just to prepare archive

[23:30:48] <uwharrie> TideLC: you mean like https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Preload ?
[23:31:12] <ayecee> no, preload primes the cache, it doesn't make them stay there.
[23:31:14] <TideLC> I dont want to keep the contents of the files in memory just the directory structure so I dont have to wait for all 50k+ files to load to find one
[23:31:45] <ananke> TideLC: say what?
[23:31:50] <ayecee> TideLC: there's no way to lock it in memory. the closest you could get is to list the directory periodically.

[23:39:18] <ayecee> definitely feels like you're on the wrong track. it's an ssd, so it doesn't have the seek time that would make loading a directory slow.
[23:39:55] <ayecee> also, using it regularly doesn't seem to affect the performance, and it would if it were the directory loading that was slow.

[23:48:12] <TideLC> are you asking me how many folders are in this directory or if dolphin in general is loading folders slowly?

[23:48:37] <ananke> TideLC: I'd suggest running 'vmstat 1' in a terminal window, then attempt that operation, then ctr-c the terminal with vmstat. that output would be useful in identifying potential issues
[23:48:38] <ayecee> the second thing. whether this performance issue occurs with one directory, or every directory
[23:50:15] <TideLC> ayecee: if it is it's not by any noticeable amount. I dont have any other folders with a large number of files to compare against.
[23:50:28] <ayecee> multiple directories but not every directory would also be a useful response. then we could examine how the affected directories differed from others.
[23:50:47] <ayecee> how many files in this directory
[23:51:07] <ayecee> ballpark figure is fine
[23:51:15] <TideLC> 63,000

[23:58:51] <ayecee> TideLC: one way to see if it's disk io that's making it slow, is to use iostat. "iostat -kx 5" would show disk util% for each 5 second interval. if that's over 80% for that whole 30 seconds, that could confirm that part at least.
