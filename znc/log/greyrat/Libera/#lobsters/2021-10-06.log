[03:22:12] <technomancy> literally the whole reason we use grpc at work with 95% clojure is that we introduced microservices with golang and golang was *so* bad at json that no one wanted to do that

[03:23:28] <indigo> Oh wow, you have to make your own struct to parse JSON
[03:23:41] <ignaloidas> also, I like how golang "has no exceptions" except you can handle panics, and that's what JSON module does a lot
[03:24:21] <shapr> yeah, I have strong opinions on both of those points
[03:25:06] <shapr> If golang had sum types, I could build an Either (what's that called in Rust?).

[17:18:27] <dimadima> hah
[17:18:58] <rhn> "he definition of mole was adopted in November 2018 [...] revising the previous definition"
[17:19:36] <dimadima> tbh is that even a metric thing or an iupac thing

[17:20:07] <prussian> I thought that is what the Mole always was. At least that's I remember from highschool chem
[17:20:19] <prussian> or did it only become an SI unit formally with that definition?

[17:27:30] <prussian> is cord imperial?
[17:29:46] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: it comes from redefining the kilogram in terms of fundamental constants, avogadro’s number is one of those constants
