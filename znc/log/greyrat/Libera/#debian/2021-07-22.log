[01:08:40] <jhutchins> greycat: It's pretty common when the router is the public interface.
[01:09:10] <jhutchins> Razva: You might want to google "linux port forwarding" - you'll get a lot more detail than we can give you here.
[01:09:25] <greycat> You mean "I want to add some port forwarding to my existing router", sure.  Yeah.  But in the ABSENCE of the thing already BEING the router between two physical networks, it just makes no sense.

[05:03:47] <edufmass> Hello, I have an old Athlon X2 5200+ with 4gb of ram and I have 2 x 4tb wd red and 3 x 2tb wd green hard disks, Can I a make a nas or fileserver with this hardware?
[05:03:57] <sney> totally
[05:04:12] <sney> could host a few VMs on it too 
[05:04:24] <PMT> Depending on what the VMs are doing, of course.
[05:04:36] <sney> right, conventional home lab stuff 
[05:04:39] <sney> plex and so on
[05:04:48] *** zerobeholder is now known as ZeroBeholder
[05:05:16] <edufmass> nice! Which fs should I use for fileserver?
[05:05:32] <PMT> That sounds like a personal opinion question.
[05:06:31] <edufmass> In desktop pc and notebook I have ext4 for daily use. This server will be for home
[05:07:35] *** Parts: jsrnop (~mark@user/jsrnop) (The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[05:07:36] <sney> ext4 is perfectly fine. with md and/or lvm for various redundancy and snapshot features etc. or not, depends on what's going on the nas. that's for you to decide. 
[05:07:51] *** ZeroBeholder is now known as zerobeholder
[05:08:03] <sney> zfs can do a lot of that stuff too, though I don't remember if 4GB is really enough memory in practice 
[05:08:07] *** zerobeholder is now known as ZeroBeholder
[05:09:42] <edufmass> I want to centralize some docs, videos. Maybe I will install gitlab just for me
[05:09:45] <PMT> ZFS will run with much less. It'll perform better with more for its caching, of course, and you might want to tell it to cap the usage lower than its defaults if you want to use a great deal of it, but it'll run.
[05:10:58] <sussudio> i have a NAS that runs ZFS with 128MB of RAM. it runs like utter shit and the files get corrupted.
[05:11:22] <sney> my first home server with zfs was a very old dell poweredge tower with a prescott p4 (the first intel amd64 cpu!) and ecc, and I don't remember if it had 4GB or 8. But it was more than sufficient for everything I was doing. I'd probably still use it if the power supply hadn't died 
[05:11:28] <PMT> sussudio: 128 MB total or 128 MB for the cache? And if it corrupts things, you should report a bug.
[05:12:00] <sussudio> 128MB total, and i don't think the Aldi where i got it takes bug reports.
[05:12:27] <PMT> I meant against OpenZFS. :P
[05:12:57] <sussudio> they managed to make the next incarnation of their NAS even worse though. it wouldn't even start until you agreed to a screen with their terms/had to be connected to the internet. i returned the fucker.
[05:13:31] <PMT> (Assuming it's running a version released in the last few years - I would not anticipate such a report getting much attention if it were against a release from 2016, for instance, other than a request to try something newer.)

[06:09:50] <zykotick9> edufmass: I'd suggest 128MB might not really be enough RAM for using zfs.  zfs is _great_ but... it's also very RAM hungry.  ymmv?  good luck.
[06:10:30] <sney> the 128MB was someone else and I'm not convinced they weren't trolling 
[06:10:54] <zykotick9> sney: ummm.  thanks.
[06:11:31] <PMT> I've seen at least one person run it with 32 MB for the ARC.
[06:13:30] <PMT> I never heard them comment on how it ran, but they didn't complain about it torching everything in sight.
[06:18:23] <zykotick9> my arc is currently sitting at 32G for a 3x3G raidz1 pool NO DEDUP. 32MB?!?!
[06:21:26] <PMT> 32 MB is the hardcoded minimum below which it will ignore you attempting to set it.
[06:22:37] <jochum> edufmass: have a look at gitea it has a much smaller footprint than gitlab
[06:23:00] <PMT> Oh sorry, it was 64 MB, 32 MB is the requirement for arc_min.

[16:39:36] <dthpulse> ratrace, what that means, that b4 upgrade I had to install this package and then it would work? Or it's different topic
[16:41:24] <ratrace> dthpulse: I don't recall where "false" was before usrmerge. I'm saying taht if you upgraded from stretch to buster and didn't install "usrmerge" package, you would not have /{s}bin merged with /usr/{s}bin, and thus /bin/false and /usr/bin/false would not both exist (and be the same binary actually)

[18:53:37] <ratrace> xx: yes, but debian backports (important) security fixes
[18:53:52] <ratrace> and then on point releases, rebases the kernel to a newer (but not latest) upstream version
[18:54:53] <ratrace> I kinda dislike that too (primarily because upstream doesn't mark security fixes as such and wants everyone to run latest kernels) so I'm using kernel.org kernels, it's easy beacuse there's .deb making target in the sources

[19:10:45] <randall> xx: What ratrace said. Debian stable only adds security fixes to the kernel in the stable security repo. Any other regular bugfixes to the kernel go through the stable-updates channel, which will only be released after thorough testing to avoid regressions.
[19:12:19] <randall> xx: Also note that the kernel devs might have other goals than Debian developers. The former will release bugfix releases and expect the latter to report any regressions. Which is why there is a delay between kernel.org release and Debian release.

[20:30:21] <ZeroBeholder> I think the difference in the install prompts is because of how qemu/kvm gets the installer going. In the qemu/kvm guests it asks about additional cd sources. Linaro provided a patch for those debconf entries... and it worked for me.
[20:30:22] <jochum> did you restart ssh?
[20:31:49] <ZeroBeholder> I can log in as root on the console with the password I set in the preseed.cfg. I have previously reset it with passwd. I did systemctl restart sshd . Regular unprivileged users can ssh in and the system responds to pings over the bridged networking.
