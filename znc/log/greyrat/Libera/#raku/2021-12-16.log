[11:44:10] <atroxaper> Hello! is there a way to take an access to private attribute of an object from a method of its class? Like class A { has $!a is built; method plus(A:U: A $one, A $two) { A.new(a => $one!a + $two!a) }
[12:06:36] <moritz_> do you want it to initialized in .new generally, or do you want that option only inside the class? If the latter, you need to write a private constructor.
[12:13:47] <atroxaper> moritz_: I need to get an access to privete attribute inside a class method. method foo(A:U: A $var) { $var!attribute } means call !attribute method instead of !attribute attribute
[12:15:47] <atroxaper> moritz_: In C I can manipulate private attributes of not only 'this' object, but any object of the class inside of a class's method.
[12:26:53] <moritz_> C doesn't have anything private, I believe :D
[12:27:10] <moritz_> and in C++, you know at compile time that the object is of that class
[12:27:24] <moritz_> currently I don't know how raku handles it
[12:33:31] <atroxaper> moritz_: I think there should be some syntax construction. Because $var!private-method works. I found solution only in creation a method !a() {$!a}

[13:37:41] <moon-child> well, I think no one is _disinterested_ in such things, but it is no small effort, and there are other things that are farther up on people's priority lists
[13:38:14] <moon-child> so for it to happen requires somebody to take an interest and make a concerted effort
[13:39:41] <synthmeat> everyone needs their thing :)
[13:40:13] <ssaint> I get you. Indeed Raku is great...so I was just wondering why the developers are not giving much attention to desktop/mobile development.

[13:40:39] <synthmeat> they're paying a lot of attention to a lot of things
[13:41:12] <lizmat> and they're generally not getting pid for what they do
[13:41:24] <ssaint> and mobile/desktop development is not necessary as at now? That is strange!!
[13:41:32] <moon-child> what synthmeat said.  But, here is something concrete: most mobile devices run arm, and the only performant raku implementation (moarvm) does not have an arm target

[13:42:19] <synthmeat> that's something ongoing, right?

[13:49:54] <synthmeat> aww

[13:51:25] <ssaint> I have been jumping around programming languages but I think Raku seems to have got things RIGHT. Nice Powerful Language. It only pains me I can't use it for mobile apps.'=(
[13:52:07] <lizmat> ssaint: well apart from walled gardens like on Apple making it hard to do anything that is not within company policies

[13:52:31] <lizmat> *mobile
[13:52:52] <lizmat> and maybe performance isn't such a big issue for the things that one may want to do on mobile apps
[13:53:01] <lizmat> at least for some applications

[14:37:57] <El_Che> synthmeat: what do you need specifally? There are up-to-date linux packages and zef
[14:49:03] <synthmeat> El_Che: i guess someone to make a binary build newer than 2021.04 and put it on https://rakudo.org/star
[14:49:33] <synthmeat> and for rstar specifically, i've no idea what to choose from ecosystem (which json/csv parsing libs, etc.) so i welcome someone picking out those
[14:49:46] <synthmeat> so that's what i like about it, is all
[14:50:07] <synthmeat> that someone went out and confirmed all those run fine
[14:51:18] <El_Che> synthmeat: so the only thing you miss is someone recommending a library?
[14:52:43] <El_Che> synthmeat: install this https://github.com/nxadm/rakudo-pkg, and use zef to install whatever you need from here https://github.com/rakudo/star/blob/master/etc/modules.txt
[14:55:14] <El_Che> synthmeat: I don't think there will be a rakudo star release any time soon. I don't think there is a star release manager any more (I may be wrong)
[14:55:46] <synthmeat> okie, that's good enough for me. thanks.
[14:56:24] <El_Che> I pkg the linux packages, so feel free to ping me
[14:56:41] <synthmeat> cloudsmith. cool.

[15:13:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> do you guys know how "is cached" works? let's suppose my function returns an object. Do I get the same object when a cached call is made?
[15:13:50] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> or do I get a new copy?
[15:14:09] <lizmat> you get the same object
[15:15:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> that makes more sense
[15:15:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> thanks

[18:33:58] <atroxaper> Am I right that if I want to avoid parenthesis when calling a sub or a method then I need a colon for method and do not need colon for sub. Why there is a difference?
[18:37:25] <atroxaper> Is this because we can control subs' signatures at compile time, but not method signatures?
