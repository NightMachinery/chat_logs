[11:43:30] <headius> if you are asking if we want to make it happen, yes we do
[11:44:36] <headius> I would say priority at the moment is getting to 9.4 so we are caught up with Ruby 3 compat (like release in January if possible) and then we can take a step back and fix up missing Java integration bits
[11:45:23] <headius> adding more info about these features, with specs or tests you'd expect to pass, can help move it along
[11:47:18] <headius> klobuczek: I forget what issues we had open for this... but this one is related: https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/5310
