[11:27:36] <adigitoleo> I have a fairly general question but I wonder if you fine people have any ideas about it: Say I export the method `foo()` which can raise a `MyError` type if something goes awry. Should I necessarily export the error type as well? I haven't at the moment, and my test suite uses it as MyModule.MyError but it feels wrong, because "only test public API" etc.
[11:29:04] <adigitoleo> My only hesitation comes from not wanting to clutter the namespace with a bunch of MyErrorFoo, MyErrorBar etc. types
[11:32:43] *** Joins: Erutuon (~Erutuon@user/erutuon)
[11:34:44] <ninjin> In the old days when we exported everything and the kitchen sink the answer would have been “Yes”, but I am not so sure these days as the community has started to switch towards `import` over `using` for pretty much everything apart from operators.

[12:48:40] <energizer> i think you are conflating export and publish
[12:49:18] <energizer> or i should say, exported and public
[12:53:59] <adigitoleo> so I should consider public API to comprise more than just exported names?
[12:59:08] <adigitoleo> or rephrased: isn't the export list the only way to indicate that some API is "more stable" than other stuff in Julia?

[19:49:20] <mns> I've got Julia installed on a FreeBSD/amd64 but keep getting the following:  "ble to find compatible target in system image"  when I start julia on the command line.  I've tried to set JULIA_CPU_TARGET=generic but that doesn't work either.  I'm not sure what I"m missing to get to the REPL prompt
[19:50:12] *** Quits: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:52:26] <mns> I'm using Julia 1.7.1
[19:52:39] <mikko> are you using official binary from julialang.org ?
[19:53:17] <mikko> i guess freebsd only has tier2 support so it isn't guaranteed to work
[19:54:43] <mns> mikko: I'm using binary from FreeBSD pkg system
[19:55:22] <mns> I'm totally new to Julia,  was looking to start learning it and so installed it.  
[19:56:03] <mikko> mns: might be worth trying the official binary, i don't know about freebsd but many (most?) packaging systems get the build wrong
[19:59:19] <ninjin> I would check in #freebsd over on the Julia Slack as much as it hurts me recommending proprietary nonsense. FreeBSD is great, but the community for it is very small. It *should* be working though if I recall the test status from a few weeks ago.
[20:02:28] <mns> ninjin: dont have slack and dont want it.  I notice that there is a 1..7.2 in the FreeBSD ports setup, so I'll take a stab at building it and seeing if that changes anything.  
[20:02:41] <mns> also will give the official binary a try as well
[20:03:31] <ninjin> As someone that has been involved with packaging Julia, absolutely go with the official binaries.
[20:05:26] <mns> will take a look at that.  have it downloading in the background
[20:06:05] <mns> is there a way to tell in Julia how it was built ?  Like what options were used, etc ? 
[20:07:38] <ninjin> mns: Yes, there should be a variable set in base. Let me see…
[20:08:16] <mns> I still need to get to doing "hello world" first :-)
[20:09:43] <ninjin> Ah, dang… Good point.
[20:10:00] <ninjin> It should be embedded in the binary, `strings`?
[20:11:10] <ninjin> There is at least this `Base.BUILD_TRIPLET = "x86_64-linux-gnu-libgfortran4-cxx11"`, but I am pretty sure there is more.
[20:11:15] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[20:11:23] <ninjin> Was a while since I read the build code.
[20:12:12] <mns> that probably just says what autoconf triplet to use.  so there must be something that contains the configure options used.
[20:20:09] <ninjin> Closing in on 02:00 so I have to go to bed, but you can check the build script and see if you can trace it from there. Took a stab, but failed.
[20:24:07] <mns> have a good night.  I'll see what I can come up with
