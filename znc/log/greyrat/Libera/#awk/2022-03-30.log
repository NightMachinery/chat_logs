[01:32:35] <tangy> hello, can awk variables be used in regexes? `ps aux | awk -v pid="$PID" '/pid/ { print $11 }' ?
[01:33:23] <tangy> I've read most of the manual, but I'm still putting it all together
[01:34:37] <tangy> ...possibly a strongly typed regexp constant....

[01:36:59] <geirha> $0 ~ pid
[01:37:37] <geirha> you can think of '/foo/' as a shorthand of '$0 ~ /foo/'
[01:38:05] <geirha> though in this case, I'd use exact matching instead
[01:38:33] <geirha> awk -v pid="$pid" '$2 == pid { print $11 }'
[01:39:04] <tangy> huh. okay

[01:39:55] <tangy> with the /pid/ I'm getting ~50 lines of ps output, and from $2 == pid I've got no output at all
[01:40:33] <tangy> oh, PID  was unset for some reason
[01:41:38] <tangy> lol
[01:41:54] <tangy> oh, right, it's just something I made up.... :-p
[01:44:55] <tangy> thanks geirha
[01:46:46] <geirha> also, don't forget that ps can take the pid as argument
[01:50:40] <tangy> okay. working on it

[22:02:14] <user51> first steps toward a parser generator in awk: http://0x0.st/oqJO.c
[22:02:53] <user51> still quite a bit of work to do - but i'm happy with what i've written so far
[22:03:32] <user51> the big comment at the beginning is the output. i've put some comments in the program to explain what's going on.
[22:13:16] <Patsie> #!/usr/bin/awk -f on line 49 is as usefull as a piece of used toiletpaper sticking out from my pants after going to the toilet
[22:16:02] <Patsie> apart from that, it looks fancy
[22:16:16] <Patsie> haven't really looked into the details or function
[22:19:46] <nmz> is that a fashion statement
[22:29:07] <xmb> what u say a parser generator is mate, im interested
[22:29:46] <xmb> i can then parse html with it ?
[22:31:06] *** Joins: YaoNai (~YaoNai@user/yaonai)
[22:31:25] <xmb> i see
[22:31:39] <user51> if you've never done any parsing before, i think a simple recursive descent parser is a good start.
[22:31:54] <xmb> what i have not done dude, ur code is the noob code, not mine
[22:32:22] <user51> why is my code noobish?
[22:32:36] <xmb> well sorry, dont assume im new
[22:32:46] <xmb> your code, is contra optimized
[22:32:59] <xmb> after 3 years of awk coding ( from now on ) ud write 5x faster variants
[22:33:16] <xmb> i dont get what ur doing much i just see OLDSTYLE OUTDATED UGLY CODE sorry not mean to harm u just saying
[22:33:20] <larryv> user51: xmb likes to thinks everyone is a noob except him. don't worry about it
[22:34:02] <xmb> old comparable code:
[22:34:56] <xmb> http://0x0.st/oqJG.bin    - it has its bugs, i need since long to write it new - it converts file tree's to bash code according to the dirs files are in
[23:03:17] <Patsie> user51: what larryv says is true
[23:03:24] <Patsie> so don't worry about it
[23:06:22] <Patsie> your code looks very clean and neat. easy to read
[23:06:50] <Patsie> clear naming, good variable names
