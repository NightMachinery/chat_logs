[07:00:29] *** Joins: apocalyptech (~apocalypt@wilug/apocalyptech)
[07:01:26] <apocalyptech> Hello all!  So.  Running unit tests w/ a database configured requires that your database user has permissions to create a `test_foo` database (which gets destroyed once the tests are done).
[07:01:49] <apocalyptech> I've *got* this set up on a system I'm working on migrating elsewhere, using a MariaDB backend, but damned if I can figure out how in the world I've got it configured on the database side.
[07:02:41] <apocalyptech> I know this question is more MariaDB than Django, but I'm hoping someone here may have run into this and know what's up.
[07:03:14] <apocalyptech> Whatever permissions it is doesn't show up in 'SHOW GRANTS': https://gist.github.com/apocalyptech/dda9751c2fd9141d3608e574d8f0c895
[07:04:06] <bparker> I don't see any permissions granted for test_hextest
[07:04:38] <bparker> only hextest.*
[07:04:46] <apocalyptech> *right*, neither do I
[07:04:52] <apocalyptech> I have no idea how in the world it's working.  :D
[07:05:10] <bparker> I thought you said it wasn't
[07:05:33] <apocalyptech> It's working on this current box, but I want to migrate this service elsewhere and I can't for the life of me figure out *how* I configured it originally.
[07:05:56] <bparker> just add the proper command for test_hextest anyway ?
[07:06:02] <bparker> regardless of how it already works
[07:06:22] <apocalyptech> That `hextest` user can create `test_hextest`, create tables in there once it's created, and then DROP it, but nowhere in MariaDB's permissions can I find references to it.  Looked directly into the `user` and `db` tables there, as well
[07:06:49] <apocalyptech> Mm, yeah, I suppose.  I hadn't really played around with much at the new host 'cause this threw me through a loop
[07:06:52] <bparker> because you have grant usage on *.* ?
[07:07:24] *** Quits: PantelicGR (~PantelicG@user/pantelicgr) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:08:36] <apocalyptech> Nah, the 'USAGE' priv doesn't really grant anything concrete.  And if it *was* something that applied to `*.*` I'd expect to be able to create *any* database, but it can seemingly only create `test_hextest`
[07:09:19] <apocalyptech> Mm, although, I *do* see that I *can* create other DBs if they start with `test_`.  Hmmm.  Got a wildcard hanging around somewhere, then, at least.
[07:09:30] <apocalyptech> I hadn't noticed that before (had just tried other prefixes like `foo_hextest` originally)
[07:10:35] <bparker> ok the usage thing apparently means nothing, way to go sql folks
[07:11:09] <apocalyptech> Ohhh, okay, yeah, that was the key.  I'd only been looking for stuff that matched %hextest% previously.
[07:11:13] <apocalyptech> heh, yeah
[07:11:24] <apocalyptech> I got it, though; turns out it's not bound to any particular user, which is also why I wasn't seeing it
[07:11:27] <apocalyptech> https://gist.github.com/apocalyptech/8f6128bbddc304401ce2e60aae5e983b
[07:11:43] <apocalyptech> Apparently I'd just allowed any valid database user to do whatever they want with `test_%` databases, including creating 'em
[07:11:55] <bparker> so why isn't that in 'show grants; >
[07:11:58] <bparker> ?
[07:12:08] <apocalyptech> Thanks for responding and pushing me in the right direction!
[07:13:14] <apocalyptech> I'm guessing that `show grants` only shows stuff *explicitly* granted to the user, ignoring sort-of implicit stuff like this
[07:13:41] <apocalyptech> Anyway, I imagine it's a very wonky setup I've got here anyway; I think I'll just tighten it up properly on the new host
[07:13:44] <apocalyptech> THanks again!
[07:18:24] <apocalyptech> I'm guessing my original thought must've been "well, this way if I have multiple django installs hitting the same database, this way I won't have to do separate GRANTs to allow them to run tests against the db."
[07:18:44] <apocalyptech> I think whatever hypothetical time I may have saved myself by doing so in the past has been soundly eclipsed by the amount of time I've spent trying to track it down tonight.  :D

Although, years passing by, my system happens to break. And to set back the system up it gets really difficult : incompatibilities between python version, django version, database version… I am looking forward to change my way with these things not to have this
[23:02:58] <proph73> kind of problems again. So I was seriously considering using docker. To start projects I generally use a cookiecutterdjango template and happily it comes with a docker configuration file. I am new to docker but in this file I can’t see django and python versions stated, so I tend to think it just uses the last version of each as the stack is set up. But then I would be prone to have the same compatibility problems in the future... What
[23:02:58] <proph73>  do you think about it ? What do you use ? What do you advise me ?

I am new to docker but in this file I can’t see django and python versions stated, so I tend to think it just uses the last version of each as the stack is set up. But then I would be prone to have the same compatibility problems in the future...
[23:03:29] <proph73> What do you think about it ? What do you use ? What do you advise me ?
[23:04:32] <papa-dinkle> @proph73 i am not an expert but i'd suggest looking up examples on using pip and requirements.txt
[23:05:08] <papa-dinkle> I just switched from using virtual environments to making a docker container for all my django projects
[23:06:42] <proph73> I already use git and requirements. Git is good for the source files, requirements is for the libraries to work with python. But what about python version itself ? What about other system modules like postgre ?
[23:06:49] <doismellburning> proph73: If you are not pinning your dependencies using something like requirements.txt or Pipenv or Poetry you are likely to have problems
[23:06:52] <doismellburning> ah ok good
[23:07:08] <doismellburning> proph73: then yes; I quite enjoy Docker for isolation at the level you're looking at
[23:10:26] <proph73> What do you think would happen if you 'd come back to your project 5 years from now ? Do you precise the versions of all the modules (I mean besides the ones in requirements) ? It is a question I have to ask on a docker channel. Thank you for sharing with me your usage.

[23:11:43] <dodo> proph73: if you pick a stable os for your image, after five years not much should have changed
[23:11:46] <doismellburning> proph73: most of my projects from 5y ago seem fine
[23:12:18] <papa-dinkle> @proph73 i like to use precise versions in requirements.txt because anyone who is using my project will have same as when i implemented. they can update as needed.
[23:13:02] <papa-dinkle> but this is a question that I have too. setting the version to a specific outdated version flies in the face of my instinct to always use latest versions of all libraries etc
[23:16:06] <dodo> papa-dinkle: do you mean not pinned when you say always the latest?
[23:16:33] <papa-dinkle> @dodo: i am not familiar with the term 'pinned' so i am not sure
[23:17:02] <dodo> papa-dinkle: you can put specific versions into the requirements file
[23:17:09] <dodo> see e.g. pip freeze
[23:17:24] <dodo> or, any modern dep management tool can do that for you
[23:17:47] <dodo> if you don't specify versions that will lead to random breakage, e.g. during restarts, tests, deployments etc
[23:18:23] <papa-dinkle> @dodo nice to learn a new term hehe. ok then my intuition was correct. always pin your requirements
[23:18:50] <dodo> yup
[23:19:22] <dodo> though even then sometimes things can break ;) some package versions can be deleted off pypy etc
[23:19:51] <papa-dinkle> what do you guys think about running venv inside your isolated docker containers? i really don't want to add another layer of complexity but I wonder if there are any benefits
[23:20:09] <dodo> papa-dinkle: yes, you don't break the os
[23:20:21] <dodo> which might not be a major concern in a container, but it's still a good practice
[23:21:16] <papa-dinkle> @dodo i can see how that'd be an issue if you were running some specific libraries for django but also running a web server or something in the same container
[23:21:29] <papa-dinkle> some other service
[23:23:06] <dodo> you shouldn't run multiple services in one container
[23:24:24] <dodo> but you could e.g. break the os package manager if it's written in python, that would prevent you from installing/upgrading packages
[23:25:43] <papa-dinkle> @dodo that makes sense. i'm still going to be a maverick and avoid venv in my personal development until an employer requires it hehe
