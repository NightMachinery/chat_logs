[00:44:01] <tricon> It's a hope.
[00:44:05] <Noisytoot> psymin: That would still be bad, WSL and the rest of windows is nonfree

[00:44:19] * psymin nods.
[00:44:22] <Noisytoot> preinstall GNU/Linux then

[00:44:38] <Noisytoot> Why are you using Windows 11?
[00:44:42] <Arsen> Noisytoot: won't work, people need office and adobe
[00:44:50] <Arsen> tpefreedom: I saw it in KDE a few years ago ;)
[00:44:56] <Noisytoot> Arsen: There is libreoffice
[00:44:59] <tpefreedom> So if I had to use it for whatever reason, I would install classic shell.
[00:45:03] <Noisytoot> and many free PDF viewers/editors
[00:45:37] <Arsen> and they don't work for many offices because the MS document formats are a mess and screw up in libreoffice
[00:45:51] <tricon> I manage a blended environment (yes, I've been introducing more FLOSS and am hoping to continue this nudge). Getting users over to web Office is a small win, but it at least breaks the automatic dependency upon desktop Office they think they need. Still an issue with non-libre JS.
[00:46:05] <Arsen> I'd know, I tried converting our business to libreoffice, only to be stumped by all the word 2003 forms being broken
[00:47:01] <tricon> We've been wanting to crack down on Office macros, and to my knowledge we don't use them much; so hopefully that would ease our transition to something else.
[00:47:02] <Noisytoot> tricon: Why not switch them to LibreOffice?
[00:47:30] *** Joins: wolftune (~aaron@75.164.131.0)
[00:47:35] <Noisytoot> Arsen: Actually, they screw up in microsoft office, libreoffice implements them more correctly
[00:47:55] <Arsen> does it matter? they produce the correct result in one and not in the other
[00:48:04] <tricon> Noisytoot: We actually do have some LibreOffice here and there. There's a lot more human-friction to moving users to LibreOffice than Office online; but I would like to utilize LibreOffice more.
[00:48:10] <Arsen> and there's volumetrically too much to just rework it all
[00:48:14] <tricon> TBH, much of it is user-training and fear.

[00:49:21] <Arsen> I personally use 100% foss, but you have to understand legacy cruft
[00:49:32] <Arsen> it's one of the things that needs to work with foss in order for preinstalls to work
[00:50:02] <tricon> Non-free JS across the web aside, I'm on Guix myself, and it's truly the future of operating systems. It's incredible.
[00:50:25] <Arsen> I never found much appeal of nix/guix' in desktop personally
[00:50:28] <Arsen> I prefer a simpler system
[00:50:46] <Arsen> however having a fully reproducible system for servers, allowing that to be shared transparently and freely, now that's beautiful
[00:50:50] <tricon> For myself, determinism is powerful. I've been teaching it to my peers.
[00:50:53] <tricon> Yah.
[00:50:54] <tricon> Exactly.
[00:51:10] <Noisytoot> Why is an fully reproducible system not useful for desktops?
[00:51:22] <tricon> "Oh, doesn't it suck that Windows update broke that thing again? Well guess what I can do in Guix..."
[00:51:25] <Arsen> well nix and guix are more than that
[00:51:48] <Noisytoot> Arsen: Being able to roll back your system if something breaks is useful
[00:51:55] <Arsen> and the "more than that" part is the interfering part, otherwise, yeah debian is quite well reproducible etc
[00:52:13] <Noisytoot> packaging for nix/guix is also easier than for many other package managers

[05:28:20] <tpefreedom> oops
[05:28:41] <tpefreedom> jxself: the first question is whether we need free culture for a free society.
[05:29:10] <jxself> Free culture is a thing that needs to exist yes. If you ask me all the things should be free.
[05:29:56] <tpefreedom> IMO patents and copyright are dumb as fxck.
[05:31:16] *** Quits: betelgeuse (~john2gb@94-225-47-8.access.telenet.be) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[05:31:21] <tpefreedom> Maybe the fsf should start promoting free culture but initially as more of a side project and then start pushing for it more once there is more free culture material out there.
[05:31:45] <jxself> In a world where the free software and free culture movements won, all the things everywhere were free, and no one ever made proprietary stuff then in that hypothetical world maybe an argument could be made that copyright isn't needed and could be safely retired. Until then, it remains a good strategy to ensure collaboration and protect freedom, via the strategic use of copyleft.

[05:32:35] *** Joins: betelgeuse (~john2gb@94-225-47-8.access.telenet.be)
[05:33:25] <dragestil> and it makes sense to focus on the freedom issues of js
[05:33:50] <dragestil> given that it is far from being fixed
[05:35:01] <nurupo> some websites are just a single <script></script> tag, no other html, a js app rendered client-side /o\
[05:35:15] <dragestil> many "free services" are not librejs compliant, including jitsi, bbb, peertube, mastodon

[05:36:49] <tpefreedom> At least that is how I understand it.
[05:36:51] <jxself> It needs to say it's free, via some way that LibreJS recognizes. Else it can't know.
[05:37:03] *** Joins: betelgeuse (~john2gb@94-225-47-8.access.telenet.be)
[05:37:32] <dragestil> afaik most of the time it is caused by unlabelled scripts or scripts without copyright notices
[05:37:42] <jxself> Like any program needs to tell you it's free, via some way you can tell. Otherwise you won't know.
[05:38:06] <dragestil> sometimes it is librejs bug
[05:38:25] <tpefreedom> At the same time, some of those things can just be done through true local clients.

[20:47:21] <bone-baboon> I have registered the #free-software-directory channel on hackint. That channel can be used as a replacement for the previous hackint channel if that is desirable.

[20:53:44] <marusich> I see.  Does "under evaluation" mean that there is some existing work already done to evaluate it?  The page and its discussion page are empty, so I'm not sure where that information is.  I'd like to collaborate but am not sure how to.

[21:04:23] <marusich> craigt, OK.  Do you know who is currently working on it, or where their notes are?  Also, is there a "checklist" beyond just https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.en.html and https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html ?
[21:04:27] <craigt> marusich: By picking up where they left of, some work might be repeated, but it is better to look at it as double-checking the work (vs. redundancy).

[21:17:47] <bone-baboon> I think it is nice to have another option for people in addition to Libera. hackint came up many times in the FSF and GNU IRC meeting. I looked into it then and it has a easy registration process that does not use Google captcha or JavaScript.
[21:18:39] <bone-baboon> It may be worth adding a hackint channel back to the FSD page as an option.
[21:19:27] <bone-baboon> I can put in the #free-software-directory topic a refence to this channel.
[21:21:24] <craigt> marusich: If you go the entry's history you can see who created the entry and what edits they have made.
[21:23:21] <marusich> I see.  Why doesn't it show up on the page?  Because it isn't approved?

[21:26:05] <craigt> adfeno: Hi. welcome. Yea, I don't think rufus is free, but I never looked that far into it.
[21:27:12] <craigt> marusich: Do you see the message "This page is a submission in progress..."? 
[21:27:21] <tpefreedom> craigt: Natively (See FSD antifeatures: Claims to build and run olny on windows.)
[21:27:44] <marusich> I don't think I can finish a review today, but I can try to put something together.  I will plan to basically walk through the things here https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Requirements and take notes on what issues arise.
[21:28:17] <marusich> Maybe next week I can share those notes and ask for advice on next steps.
[21:29:49] <marusich> Thank you for the tips; I think this is enough to help me get started.
[21:30:10] <bone-baboon> craigt: I have not reived a response from FIGlet yet. 
[21:30:50] <adfeno> marusich: also, look at the FSD:Participate page
[21:31:09] <adfeno> It also links to a page with scripts that can help you.
[21:33:41] <adfeno> marusich: I also like to point out the existance of the FSD Script Aid: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate/Script_aid
[21:34:04] <craigt> marusich: Very good. Thanks for the interest. It may seem like a lot of info at first, but it smooths out in a short amount of time. We are also very open to feedback, and if you have something lengthy, you can send it to https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/directory-discuss
[21:34:18] <craigt> We are into hour two of this week's Free Software Directory Meeting. If you are new or just want a refresher, check out the participation guidelines. https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate We also have the directory-discuss mailing list which you can sign up for at https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/directory-discuss
[21:34:30] <adfeno> Which helps finding possible things that need to be considered.

[21:36:39] <Noisytoot> craigt: You could use PyLink to bridge it (I run a PyLink bridge with libera (clientbot), hackint (clientbot), and pissnet (unrealircd/server)), but it must be bridged to at least 1 network where it is linked as a server. You could also use matterbridge, which is what #techrights uses
[21:37:56] <adfeno> I mostly find bridges complex to install, since many FSDG-fit distros don't have all the packages, so we don't know if they are free/libre or not.
[21:39:08] <bone-baboon> A while ago I was playing with cowsay's -f option. I remembered see odd results. I looked at it again this week. These are my observation that I would appreciate feedback on:
[21:39:08] <bone-baboon> Fictional characters can be protected by copyright and trademark. This is an explanation that uses Disney characters as an example but it applies to the following as well.
[21:39:08] <bone-baboon> <https://info.legalzoom.com/article/legal-use-disney-characters>
[21:39:08] <bone-baboon> Playing with cowsay's -f option I ran across what appear to be problematic files. All of the following characters are likely trademarked and copyrighted (however I have not verified that).

[21:41:11] <bone-baboon> It does not look like these problematic files are going to be fixed upstream as the CONTRIBUTING.md file says "Issues and pull requests ... will be ignored."
[21:41:13] <bone-baboon> A simple patch could be to remove the problematic files.

[21:44:20] <craigt> bone-baboon: We only really needed one or two example to warrant looking into it.
[21:44:23] <panosalevro> adfeno: i will look into that. i shouldnt add them on the entry im working on, though, right?
[21:45:32] <craigt> bone-baboon: A paste would work, and adding the list to the entry's discussion page would be useful as well.
[21:45:39] <bone-baboon> craigt: I looked at all the files in the cows directory of the cowsay repo and those were the ones I identified as questionable.
[21:46:11] <adfeno> panosalevro: You can add in the "Software prerequisites" tab, as mediawiki style-internal links (example: [[Libfoo]]), please *do not* add version information in that tab, only the entry's page.

[21:47:18] <craigt> adfeno: Thanks!
[21:47:22] <panosalevro> last question. what exactly am i supposed to add to license copyright and license note?
[21:47:55] <craigt> panosalevro: double checking...
[21:49:09] <craigt> panosalevro: The License Copyright should have the copyright notice which would include the name of the copyright holder (normally the author, but not always).
[21:49:17] <bone-baboon> craigt: Okay I will add what I shared here to the discussion page of cowsay on the FSD. Should I email to the directory-discuss mailing list sharing a linking to the cowsay discussion page on the FSD once I have that done?
[21:49:35] <adfeno> As far as I remember, when I was a reviewer, I used to use "License note" for describing file/paths governed by such license, if  they do differ from the license with "no note"
[21:50:38] <panosalevro> unfortunately they dont have neither a copyright notice nor a license note... they just pasted the gpl text

[21:51:44] <craigt> panosalevro: License note is supposed to have link to the COPYING file, but is also a good place to add any additional information related to the licensing for the project.
[21:52:15] <panosalevro> craigt: hmm ok, then i can add the licenses of the third party libraries used
[21:53:28] <adfeno> panosalevro: if there are dependencies (third-party libraries) I think you should add then to their respective FSD entries.

[21:54:55] <craigt> bone-baboon: Thank you. You can always email the directory-discuss list. That is a good way to get attention on a matter, especially if it is a priority.
[21:55:27] <adfeno> (and, as I hinted before, look out for any files which might have different licenses)
[21:56:03] <panosalevro> thanks adfeno

[21:56:50] <adfeno> You, as well as marusich , can also perhaps benefit from using a script to scan for possible things to look into, such as this one:
[21:57:02] <adfeno> https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate/Script_aid
[21:57:49] <panosalevro> i will look into that, thanks
[21:59:02] <adfeno> The script is really portable, you probably already have all that is needed to use it.
[21:59:33] <craigt> bone-baboon: But it is a good exercise for the review process. I would follow through with what you are doing, and we can see how it all works. (and if it works efficiently)
[22:00:26] <bone-baboon> craigt: Okay
[22:01:14] <bone-baboon> cowsay may be a higher priority for operating systems distributing cowsay. They may not want to run into trademark or copyright enforcement action.

[23:30:01] <bone-baboon> craigt: If the cowsay repository is unmaintained then it might be easier to make an unmaintained fork of the cowsay repository with the only change being the removal of the problem files. This could maybe even be easier than looking for an already existing fork of cowsay that does not have the files. Maybe this should be brought up in the email I write to the directory-discuss mailing list. Someone on that mailing list might know of a
[23:30:01] <bone-baboon> fork without the problem files.
[23:30:13] <craigt> panosalevro: Manually checking for the licensing of a project typically works. For the most part if the main directory has a COPYING file and/or the copyright and licensing is declared in a README file, that works, but it is inadequate. 
[23:30:13] <adfeno> Oh, OK, thanks craigt and all ;)
[23:30:37] <panosalevro> craigt: noted
[23:30:43] *** Joins: ChristopherBurg (~Christoph@64.91.16.185)
[23:30:56] <craigt> panosalevro: it is inadequate because each significant code file should have a copyright/licensing notice header.
[23:31:11] <craigt> Yup, that's a wrap. Thanks everybody for another great meeting.
[23:31:13] <panosalevro> so i need that tool, right?
[23:31:51] <adfeno> panosalevro: also, it is inadequate since, in the side of the reviewer, assuming that the README/main file is the only one that could have that notice is a dangerous assumption.
[23:31:52] <craigt> bone-baboon: That is a good call.
[23:32:37] <panosalevro> adfeno: right
[23:32:55] <adfeno> (I was once surprised to see a project which had a problematic license hidden in the many source files it had)
[23:33:03] <craigt> panosalevro: What scancode-toolkit is good at finding is proprietary or commercial licensed code files (based off the headers) slipped into the code base.
[23:34:05] <adfeno> This is why we often say that for a package to be free/libre, one can't be sure of that just by checking the main file or the README.
[23:34:27] <adfeno> s/ we / I /
[23:34:41] <adfeno> (sorry for assuming others would say the same)
[23:35:12] <bone-baboon> adfeno: Are you the person that suggested I join FSD's free software evaluation project team?
[23:35:16] <panosalevro> what i dont get is where else i should look for the license of the project
[23:35:31] <bone-baboon> What is the FSD's free software evaluation project team?
[23:35:34] <adfeno> bone-baboon: Yes, it was I ;)
[23:36:11] <bone-baboon> I read the link where can I find more information on it?
[23:36:52] <adfeno> bone-baboon: that project team often looks up for packages/entries which have some complexity or which, due to their popularity, deserve some careful evaluation.

[23:38:39] *** N is now known as ProtoMan
[23:38:48] <adfeno> bone-baboon: Mostly, that page is all that is about the project, but you can also send MemoServ message to David_Hedlund here in this Libera IRC.
[23:38:53] <craigt> panosalevro: I emailed you the scancode-toolkit, focus on the license__name & license__short_name columns. I open it in Calc and use a filter.
[23:39:32] <adfeno> bone-baboon: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Free_software_evaluation
[23:39:33] <panosalevro> craigt: thanks. what exactly should i look for though?
[23:39:49] <adfeno> David_Hedlund is the Team Captain of that project team.
[23:40:43] <adfeno> Hm, let me check if he is indeed registered here in this IRC.
[23:40:52] <adfeno> (otherwise sending memos will fail)
[23:41:46] <craigt> panosalevro: Look for code files tagged as 'proprietary' or 'commercial' for sure. Sometimes it will say 'unknown' and those are worth looking at.
[23:42:07] <craigt> panosalevro: Scancode does return false-positive, but one just works through it.
[23:42:12] <craigt> *false-positives.
[23:42:48] <bone-baboon> adfeno: David replied in that email thread and told me to participate in this meeting when I asked for further information.
[23:43:06] <adfeno> bone-baboon: OK, forget about MemoServ, David likes to be contacted by other means when offline it seems.
[23:43:25] <panosalevro> craigt: there are some 'proprietary' and 'commercial' results, but it's just the README.md file
[23:43:59] <adfeno> bone-baboon: Hm… OK'll check the emails.
[23:44:06] <craigt> panosalevro: Yup, false-positives. It is not a perfect solution
[23:44:12] <craigt> panosalevro: :)
[23:44:40] <panosalevro> haha ok. but is the lack of other results indicative of it being libre?
[23:45:36] <adfeno> bone-baboon: Oh I see now, … I think he was supposed to show up, but might have had an urgent matter to attend.
[23:45:49] <adfeno> I can't see him online in other channels also.

[23:46:59] <bone-baboon> panosalevro: Probably not because that raises the problem of false negatives.
[23:47:20] <craigt> panosalevro: I would classify the lack of other results as simply poorly licensed source code, but small code files don't usually have the copyright/licensing header.

[23:48:35] <panosalevro> craigt: right. so the less clear the licensing is, the more work for us to identify libre software 
[23:48:53] <craigt> panosalevro: Code files without headers are generally consider to be under the COPYING file in the main directory or other place (example: in the subfolder along with the code files)
[23:49:11] <craigt> panosalevro: Pretty much.

[23:54:48] <craigt> panosalevro: Besides the proprietary and commercial, we need to make sure all the other licenses listed are on the license list https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html 
[23:55:23] <craigt> panosalevro: This is slow at first, but you'll start to become familiar with what is on the list over time.
[23:56:39] <adfeno> panosalevro: Re: when: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/FSD:Requirements are met, and as my own observations: when there is copyright and license notices for all files (be it in master file or in each file, but always check for all cases), each license is compatible, and there are no "additional restrictions" put by the copyright holders.
[23:56:51] <panosalevro> thats the process i followed when i checked the licenses of the libraries
[23:57:16] <panosalevro> yeah i understand

[23:59:46] <adfeno> Sometimes FSDG-fit distros also contribute to the reviews, although they might as well be suffering from the licensing but, if any found by the FSD.
