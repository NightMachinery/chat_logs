[04:31:08] * hayley contemplates reworking how SBCL manages its new area set, to make it more like the actual parallel GC she should be implementing.
[04:32:20] <hayley> For some reason, when the set of new pages to scan is small, SBCL maintains two sets, works on one to completion, and pushes work to another. Then the first set is cleared, and the two sets are swapped. But the more common way to do this seems to be to use one set, which we push and pop from concurrently.
[04:34:32] <hayley> This matters since I've merely parallelised that two-set procedure, and it introduces some time where one GC thread might have work, but is waiting for the others to complete.

[04:59:26] <hayley> <https://simonmar.github.io/bib/papers/parallel-gc.pdf> presents the wrong terminating condition for a GC thread. If you only finish when the pending set is empty, then you can lose GC threads if all pages are concurrently being processed when you observe the set. The termination condition is when no other threads have work, and the pending set is empty.
[05:02:42] <hayley> Aha, the actual algorithm on pages 4-5 is correct though.
[05:02:48] <hayley> The simple version on p.3 was wrong.
[05:06:06] <hayley> w.r.t parallelism when you have few parallel pointers (e.g. too many linked lists), I wonder if there's a sort of "trial marking" as a dual to "trial deletion" in reference counting. There was a paper where they randomly decided objects were live, which gave additional parallelism at the cost of keeping random data live. You could hypothetically represent "these objects are speculatively live iff this object is live". idk

[13:40:43] <humasect> learning JP was a trip, hacked english to death, and hebrew now... because writing is intimately tied into visual processing, writing right-to-left with right hand is... all right ??
[13:40:49] <humasect> yeh =)
[13:45:07] <kakuhen> my favorite part in writing japanese is when i get to make really nice and compact axes labels for graphs
[13:45:26] <kakuhen> because for horizontal axis, I simply write horizontal right -> left, then for labels on vertical axis, i just write vetically
[13:45:57] <kakuhen> or if you have a graph with bins on horizontal axis and you want to neatly pack them, writing vertically helps a lot
[13:46:19] <selwyn> what kinds of graphs do you make? do you publish in japanese?
[13:47:13] <kakuhen> i do not publish anything, but i used to make a bunch of my own ltitle charts and graphs when discussing finance with some friends and shared with them

[13:49:00] <kakuhen> most math departments will only take english, german, or russian
[13:49:12] <selwyn> you can publish in german?
[13:49:17] <kakuhen> i think even in japanese universities, most math papers will be written in english unless it's lecture notes for some class
[13:49:19] <humasect> what about french being main politick language
[13:49:56] <kakuhen> yes, some german mathematicians decide to write papers or textbooks in german out of "linguistic pride," so to speak.
[13:49:57] <kakuhen> and you can apparently find lots of useful literature in combinatorics that's still only in russian
[13:50:16] <selwyn> in quantum computing, there are like 2 foundational papers in russian that i don't think have been translated

[18:32:58] <gilberth> Good morning #lispcafe!
[18:35:22] <gilberth> It's depressing how much RENDER is based on bitmaps. When I want to draw a triangle with a certain colour, I need two auxiliary bitmaps: One filled with the colour I want and one serving as the clip mask. Even if the colour is just an RGBA tuple and the clip mask is a simple rectangle, I need to render both to a bitmap.
[18:35:49] <phoe> ouch
[18:37:41] <gilberth> Yes, and as the clip mask needs to be sharp, that is not anti-aliased, while I want the shape itself rendered with anti-aliasing, I cannot in general clip my triangles analytically.
[18:38:19] <phoe> I've been using Vecto recently
[18:38:29] <phoe> have you ever looked at it?
[18:39:36] <gilberth> Never. Actually, I believe I don't want to follow the low-level route and rather use libX11 and libcairo by FFI.
[18:40:31] <White_Flame> but the triangle itself can be antialiased by teh server?
[18:40:55] <White_Flame> so it sounds like clipping needs to happen as part of your triangle tesselation, as opposed to the clip mask
[18:42:10] <gilberth> White_Flame: The triangle is rendered with anti-aliasing by the server. But as I said: The clip mask must be sharp. That is a _bit_mask with discrete alpha values either being fully-opaque or fully-transparent on the pixel grid.
[18:42:22] <White_Flame> what are you trying to use the clip mask for?
[18:42:39] <scymtym> phoe: vecto is built on top of cl-vectors and cl-aa. McCLIM has a backend (and other extensions) using the latter two. the rendering is nice but pretty slow. this example uses parts of the backend to produce a raster image: https://techfak.de/~jmoringe/clim-raster-graphic.png
[18:42:59] <gilberth> Subwindows and responding to exposure events.
[18:43:42] <White_Flame> and subwindows are rectangular?
[18:43:53] <White_Flame> or at least don't have any subpixel effects?
[18:44:10] *** Quits: santiagopim (~user@44.pool90-167-219.static.orange.es) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:44:25] <gilberth> White_Flame: They could be any shape, but they must be sharp.
[18:45:05] <gilberth> So that I could render a single subwindow anew without needing to render all ancestors too.
[18:46:34] <scymtym> gilberth: are only top-level sheets mirrored in your system?
[18:46:35] <White_Flame> that does make sense
[18:47:20] <gilberth> And yes, when a clip mask, which comes from the subwindow shape, the exposure event at hand and the user clipping region is not a rectangle list, I already render it to a bitmap with my core X11 backend. And at times with Cocoa and Cairo too. My point was that, even for the simple case that the effective clip mask is just a rectangle list, I need to render that to a bitmap with RENDER.
[18:47:57] <gilberth> scymtym: With X11: yes, only the top-level sheets are mirrored.
[18:48:29] <scymtym> gilberth: makes sense, thanks
[18:48:39] <White_Flame> of course, by going bitmap with that, it's the same speed & message size no matter the complexity of the number of windows affecting the clip
[18:50:51] <gilberth> White_Flame: But me needing to allocate and deallocate the underlying bitmap server resources. But I could go with a stack of aux buffers the size of my back buffer, which is the size of my top-level window at hand.
[18:51:41] <gilberth> scymtym: I do this for double buffering and for scrolling not triggering a round-trip.
[18:52:51] <selwyn> whats the best place to store data
[18:53:53] <White_Flame> it does sound like you could use singleton bitmaps for the common cases
[18:54:03] <White_Flame> but yeah, annoying to manage if it's always just the base case render
[18:54:26] <White_Flame> selwyn: the nsa
[18:54:43] <scymtym> gilberth: you can only avoid the repaint part of the roundtrip, right? the best case i can image is that you have the pixmaps/images prepared and only have to draw them onto the mirror of the top-level sheet in response to the input event (or timing event, whatever)
[18:54:56] <gilberth> White_Flame: Indeed. That I have a pixmap cache inbetween for non-trivial cases doesn't make it any easier.
[18:56:09] *** Joins: humasect (~humasect@2001:1970:57e0:4100::1ae0)
[18:56:42] <gilberth> scymtym: I can do better: Anticipate the exposure event and just send the needed drawing requests beforehand, note that the exposure will come in and then ignore it. McCLIM does (did?) that. You can also play tricks with the background pixmap of the scrolled windows.
[18:57:53] <scymtym> gilberth: if you are talking about drawing to the off-screen buffer, sure, i can see that
[18:58:56] <gilberth> I decided against this approach. It's way easier and nicer to handle this with non-mirrored sheets also for double buffering. I can't see how you can have the latter with mirrored sheets. That is, when you resize or scroll with Free-CLIM, all needed redrawing is made in the back buffer and then a single CopyArea request is send to the server once done => Look ma, no tearing.
[19:01:00] <gilberth> scymtym: You can do the former without an off-screen buffer. You know, which areas are exposed with you change the scrolled subwindow position. Just send then right away. I have no idea, if that is still present in McCLIM. I called that "negative exposures", as I maintain a list of the anticipated exposure to ignore them, when they come in.
[19:01:41] <phoe> gilberth: TIL, thank you
[19:01:45] <scymtym> right, i also use single-mirroring, an off-screen buffer and CopyArea once a frame should be displayed on the monitor
[19:01:55] <phoe> oh goodness that is a mahjong tile
[19:01:59] <phoe> I want to go and play some riichi now
[19:02:36] <scymtym> phoe: yeah, some time ago you asked about options for producing raster images and didn't want to mention CLIM without making sure it works first
[19:03:18] <phoe> :D
[19:03:34] <selwyn> white_flame: great, wonder if i can do crypto cloud mining on there as well
[19:04:02] <shka> cloud mining
[19:04:05] <gilberth> scymtym: With my design the back-buffer is optional, I also could do without. And when [non-mirrored] subwindows are just moved -- which also happens when scrolling -- I blitter those pixels that just moved within the back buffer without calling the repaint handler.
[19:04:06] <shka> that's a new one

[19:07:26] <scymtym> gilberth: right, that's more sophisticated. do you force sheet transformations to result in integer positions? otherwise scrolling factional pixel amounts could give different results depending on whether the rectangle copying optimization or the repaint handler was used
[19:09:01] <gilberth> scymtym: BTW there is the DOUBLE-BUFFER extension with X11, which works just fine, but for one annoying issue: Whenever the top level window is resized, the back-buffer is too, there is no hysteresis implemented at the server making opaque resize painfully slow.

[19:10:05] <gilberth> scymtym: Yes, I round sheet coordinates to the port's physical grid/pixel resolution.
[19:10:45] <scymtym> gilberth: i knew it existed but i heard it was flawed, so i haven't looked into it yet. so far, having the off-screen buffer as a pixmap, drawing into that and copying to the mirror to "flip" buffers has worked ok
[19:10:48] <gilberth> Which could be pretty coarse in case of a TTY backend, which I am also working on.
[19:12:12] <gilberth> scymtym: The major flaw is resizing the backbuffer each time the top-level window resized. What is the real pity though is, that the implementation of DOUBLE-BUFFER doesn't use the real back-buffer.
[19:13:00] <gilberth> In the OpenGL sense where your graphics boards has a single screen-sized backbuffer to be flipped on vsync.
[19:13:08] <scymtym> funny, i just added hysteresis-style resizing of off-screen buffers
[19:13:45] <gilberth> Funny indeed. Should make things way more responsive with opaque resize.
[19:14:27] <scymtym> wouldn't using a screen-sized buffer in applications interfere with compositing (was that the term?) window managers?
[19:15:31] <gilberth> No, composing works by each window having its own window sized buffer to be blittered by the window manager into another buffer for display.
[19:17:08] <gilberth> That's an awful long chain of buffers. Your back-buffer => the compositing back-buffer => the window manager's back-buffer => screen. Three needless copies.
[19:17:58] <scymtym> that is my understanding as well. which is why i don't see how applications could use, which would imply sharing(?), the global back buffer
[19:18:30] <gilberth> The "traditional" approach is you painting to the graphics board's backbuffer and the flip on vsync is just a single bit flip on the graphic boards to tell it which buffer to scan and send to the display.
[19:18:58] <scymtym> but i should study the double buffer extension first instead of making assumptions and speculating
[19:19:33] <scymtym> sure, that's the traditional opengl model i know
[19:20:02] <gilberth> scymtym: The problem is: The existing implementation of the DOUBLE-BUFFER extension doesn't do anything different from what you do. In theory it could give you access to the real back-buffer, in practice it does not.
[19:21:03] <scymtym> i can somewhat see that, but still wonder how multiple application wouldn't draw over each other's stuff with a single shared real back buffer
[19:21:44] <gilberth> How is that prevented for the front-buffer with core X11?
[19:23:30] <scymtym> fair point. i was thinking "access" = upload to/download from the buffer arbitrarily, but it doesn't have to be like that
[19:26:17] <scymtym> one thing, though. if the display server was literally "flipping" between buffers instead of repeatedly copying an off-screen buffer to the screen, the application would get an "outdated" back buffer to draw onto and would have to either clear and redraw from scratch like in opengl or redraw in some more complicated way
[19:27:27] <gilberth> Well, if you just upload stuff to the back-buffer, that back-buffer isn't your back-buffer anymore. The whole idea of the back-buffer in the GL sense is to be the temporary buffer you do your actual rendering on. The idea: "I prepare a bitmap on my own and send that to some other buffer" is the new IMHO flawed thinking.
[19:29:09] <gilberth> scymtym: Indeed. The old-school GL does just that. You get an outdated back-buffer and render anew. These days, you could also indicate that the back-buffer keeps its contents.
[19:30:49] <scymtym> i understand, but say you render to buffer A, then A is displayed and you render to buffer B, then B is displayed and you render to buffer A again. the (say uncleared) buffer A you get does not have the things you drew to B
[19:32:01] <gilberth> Correct. Unless you have hardware which copies your back-buffer on a flip.
[19:33:22] <gilberth> What you describe is the original GL model. At a different time, with slower copying speeds and on the rationale that a new frame needs to rendered anew anyway, because you view and animate some 3D scene.
[19:34:22] <scymtym> right, with moving cameras and such, you probably can't keep any regions in the general case
[19:34:46] <scymtym> i have to ride to the office now, sorry

[21:19:34] <gilberth> But in theory, we have all bits and pieces to render to just a bit array. I could perhaps craft a VNC backend. Or use it as an all-Lisp bitmap file medium.

[22:27:07] <shka> will i get approval for https://github.com/marijnh/Postmodern/pull/294 ?
[22:27:08] -ixelp- Added retry-transaction restart in the call-with-transaction function. by sirherrbatka · Pull Request #294 · marijnh/Pos [...]
[22:27:22] <phoe> shka: I have no postmodern competence to be able to approve that
[22:27:34] <phoe> I think I have a bit of knowledge regarding restarts, but postmodern is still mostly opaque for me
[22:27:38] <shka> moral approval :D
[22:27:48] <phoe> oh, wait
[22:27:52] <phoe> there's a restart there
[22:28:02] <shka> i am trying to be a good boy
[22:32:29] <phoe> there

[22:32:42] <phoe> three comments and it should be good for merging
[22:33:50] <shka> oh
[22:33:51] <shka> ok
[22:34:05] *** Joins: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth)
[22:34:50] <shka> phoe: remind me what is the deal with find-restart 
[22:34:52] <phoe> 1) INVOKE-RESTART will signal a CONTROL-ERROR if a restart is not found
[22:34:53] *** Quits: treflip (~user@user/treflip) (Quit: good night)
[22:35:07] <phoe> and you probably don't want that, because e.g. CL:CONTINUE does not do that
[22:35:36] <phoe> 2) a missing report will mean that the restart will be displayed like [RETRY-TRANSACTION] RETRY-TRANSACTION in sldb
[22:35:43] <shka> ok, but is it better to silently fail?
[22:36:05] <phoe> silently fail where?
[22:36:30] <phoe> if you are in the debugger then calling (retry-transaction) will return NIL in the new scheme, but you will still be in the debugger
[22:36:56] <phoe> in your current implementation, when you are in the debugger, calling (retry-transaction) will cause you to end up in a recursive debugger with a CONTROL-ERROR
[22:37:23] <phoe> (if there is no restart with that name)
[22:37:41] <shka> ok, but what if handler-bind?
[22:38:05] <phoe> you want your HANDLER-BIND to decline handling a condition and let something else handle it
[22:38:15] <phoe> or do you want it to signal a CONTROL-ERROR out of nowhere
[22:38:39] <shka> i would actually prefer control-error...
[22:39:23] <phoe> a control-error means that control flow in your program is fucked
[22:39:23] <shka> because failing to retry transaction is just a fatal programming error
[22:39:46] <shka> well, i would actually say that it kinda is at this point
[22:39:50] <phoe> in other words:
[22:39:52] <phoe> it doesn't matter
[22:40:29] <phoe> unless someone calls RETRY-TRANSACTION when there is no transaction to retry
[22:40:30] <shka> but whatever you can just keep calling invoke-restart manually
[22:40:48] <phoe> calling it manually? what do you mean?

[22:41:40] <shka> phoe: handler-bind ((database-error (lambda (c) (invoke-restart 'postmodern:retry-transaction)))...
[22:42:00] <phoe> so you want to retry a transaction for all database errors
[22:42:00] <shka> instead of calling retry-transaction function
[22:42:14] <shka> no, 
[22:42:19] <phoe> yes
[22:42:24] <phoe> this handler-bind says exactly that
[22:42:28] <shka> that was example
[22:42:31] <phoe> :D
[22:42:39] <shka> because i didn't want to write check for the error code
[22:42:48] <phoe> OK, understood
[22:42:52] <shka> which is supposed to be 40001
[22:43:00] <phoe> oh
[22:43:14] <phoe> so you only want to offer the RETRY-TRANSACTION restart when the error code is 40001?
[22:43:19] <shka> no
[22:43:36] <shka> i want to offer it all times, and let the user check 
[22:43:45] <shka> separation of concerns and all that
[22:43:59] <phoe> OK
[22:44:09] <phoe> that works
[22:44:10] <shka> also, variable active transactions are kinda evil IMHO
[22:44:36] <phoe> my nitpick is, what do you do when there is *no* transaction to retry
[22:44:42] <phoe> like, there is no transaction in progress whatsoever
[22:44:52] <phoe> and that would be calling (retry-transaction) with no active transaction
[22:45:07] <shka> yes, i would expect that to be some kind of error
[22:45:12] <phoe> OK, that works then
[22:45:27] <shka> because dude, your transactions don't work the way you think they work
[22:45:33] <phoe> fixed my comment
[22:45:49] <phoe> you need to add the condition object to FIND-RESTART so you don't end up invoking a restart associated with another condition
[22:45:50] <shka> and i would rather get slapped in the face at this point then debug silent failure
[22:46:01] <phoe> so, no WHEN there
[22:46:41] <shka> very well
[22:46:56] <shka> i am tempted at signaling error when restart is nil
[22:47:12] <phoe> when restart is nil?
[22:47:16] <phoe> INVOKE-RESTART will do that for you
[22:47:30] <phoe> unless you want a custom error message
[22:47:32] <shka> not a descriptive error 
[22:47:33] <phoe> then that'll work
[22:47:42] <phoe> oh, yes, (error "No transaction in progress.") or something
[22:47:55] <shka> also, postmodern has custom condition types, let me check that
[22:48:09] <phoe> OK
