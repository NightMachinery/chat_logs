[12:45:17] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> It works out of the box here
[12:46:44] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> It looks like it uses the defautl service which is 'wordnik'
[13:08:38] <FromGitter> <svenpanne> After updating things today I got the `Wrong number of arguments: (1 . 1), 2` message. Then I followed the tip above and nuked all *.elc files, but this made things only slightly better, now I have the `Wrong number of arguments: ((t) (candidate) (require 'flx) ...` problem of the OP, and Spacemacs is effectively unusable. Alas, I removed the data needed for a rollback already, are there any tips/local fixes to 
[13:08:38] <FromGitter> ... resurrect Spacemacs? Somehow helm seems to be seriously broken at the moment...
[13:15:21] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Refactor the banner display? Ah, well I have not looked very much into that...
[13:16:44] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I guess extra documentation is always welcome (although info about the banner probably has no priority, and these things can easily be found using the `SPC h d` functions)
[13:17:38] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Well maybe not that easily indeed...
[13:29:48] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Maybe you could switch to Iyv or Compleseus layer for the moment?
[13:32:54] <FromGitter> <JDawson-Camlin> I did `SPC f e U` to update Spacemacs' packages and now Spacemacs has this problem (https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/15438). How can I undo the package update? How can I do a package rollback?
[13:34:34] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @JDawson-Camlin From the Spacemacs home screen
[13:36:36] <FromGitter> <JDawson-Camlin> @dalanicolai, thank you!
[13:38:46] <FromGitter> <svenpanne> I just added a comment to the commit above: Reverting `helm-fuzzy-highlight-matches` to its previous state makes things usable again. That function should definitely be more flexible in what it accepts, waiting for other packages to adapt to that change is not a good idea IMHO: Spacemacs is totally unusable in its current state.
[13:41:13] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I am not using helm... but if the problem is just in helm-flx... then maybe you could just comment out `helm-flx` from the `helm-packages`list...
