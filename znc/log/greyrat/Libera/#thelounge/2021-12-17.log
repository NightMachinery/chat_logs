[05:31:43] <Warr1024> Got that "Disconnected from the network, and will not reconnect. Use /connect to reconnect again." error again.  Happens sometimes with Twitch's IRC bridge.  No explanation other than that.  Is this fixed in latest yet?  I was gonna stick with stable but I'll update if it's fixed there...

[05:40:34] <Warr1024> Huh, ick, looks like something causes an irc "close" event and there doesn't look like a good way to differentiate that from a voluntary disconnect, other than maybe keeping track of that state elsewhere?

[16:18:08] <Warr1024> Also there wouldn't be access to network.userDisconnected there, would there?  So it would have to keep track of the state it's supposed to be in separately.

[16:20:39] <bookworm> Warr1024: TL passes autoreconnect=true or some such to irc-framework. However to avoid spamming networks the framework only honors the option if you're connection was stable for more than 5s. So if you reconnect, that succeeds but you immediately drop after a second it stops reconnecting

[16:21:17] <bookworm> your*
[16:27:34] <Warr1024> Okay, that sounds like an explanation of why the problem is, but then what should be done to fix it?
[16:28:15] <Warr1024> Either IRC framework needs to remove that 5s restriction, or offer some way to override it, or TL needs to work around it ... or I need to keep working around TL
[16:30:05] <Warr1024> It also sounds like something that should have entirely different symptoms to what I'm seeing, i.e. a "disconnected, will not reconnect" error out of the blue.  I was about to try poking around at steps to repro, because it seemed almost like getting a FIN instead of RST, like might happen if the IRC server itself is restarted ungracefully.
[16:30:25] <bookworm> the framework maintainer said they'd merge a pacht that makes it configurable, someone just needs to do it
[16:31:09] <bookworm> you get it without any reconnect prior to the won't reconnect state?

[17:09:45] <Warr1024> Yeah.  I think I have had it in a reconnect state as well, but I've also had just "disconnected, will not reconnect" completely out of the blue.  I also wondered whether it could be like a stateful firewall timing out the connection, which ping timers should usually prevent, but maybe it was some weird transient.
[17:10:36] <Warr1024> I guess the problem is that when it comes to networking, "weird, unreproducible transients" are sort of the norm :-)

[17:39:57] <danny> I'm seeing some weirdness that I don't understand take place with thelounge. A small subset of clients see this error when trying to connect to an IRC network that's running on the same host as thelounge: "Connection closed unexpectedly: Error: Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established"
[17:40:07] *** Quits: Warr1024 (~Warr@user/warr1024) (Quit: Warr1024)
[17:40:17] <danny> different clients with the exact same settings have varying results, which is perplexing
[17:40:47] <danny> when I enable ircFramework debug logs, I can see the failed clients error out with: NetTransport socketError() Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established
[17:43:59] <bookworm> I mean the error pretty much explains what happened... the remote hung up for some reason prior to the handshake being successful... google points to some defect in proxy settings or firewall
[17:44:25] *** Joins: Warr1024 (~Warr@user/warr1024)
[17:45:01] <bookworm> do you run a god awful TLS stack in the ircd that tries to speak TLSv1 or some such?
[17:46:00] <bookworm> although that should yield a different error I think
[17:50:00] <Warr1024> "socket disconnect before TLS" errors can be rather generic, i.e. when it got a TCP connection to the server but failed anywhere during the TLS process.  Can happen when you connect to a not-TLS port, when the connection is dropped by a firewall, some kinds of timeouts, etc.
[17:50:18] <Warr1024> I dunno if thelounge specifically catches some of those scenarios but elsewhere I see it a lot.

[17:52:10] <Warr1024> Are there some settings that would be good to set for thelounge to help debugging a rare transient issue on an otherwise production system?  i.e. I'd like to be able to capture more logs, but not like the "every packet" or "every message" level of verbosity...

[17:54:26] <danny> ugh why did i ever agree to running all this infra
[17:54:54] <danny> oh wait, it's back - i guess it takes a while to load the buffers from the logs
[17:55:45] <danny> Warr1024 there's a raw debug thing but I haven't turned it on yet, I figured it would be too verbose
[17:56:50] <Warr1024> guess I can try debug.ircFramework at least; it was off for me.
[17:57:29] <danny> yeah that's a fairly healthy amount of log ime
[17:57:38] <Warr1024> Also interesting that socket.io transports is set to ["polling", "websocket"]; any reason that shouldn't be ["websocket", "polling"]?
[17:57:59] * danny squints
[17:58:04] <danny> that definitely looks like the same thing
[17:58:44] <Warr1024> {polling:true, websocket:true} and {websocket:true, polling:true} would be the same thing.  ["polling", "websocket"] vs ["websocket", "polling"] clearly imply something different though.
[17:59:19] <xnaas> websockets are something you "upgrade" a connection to, so it makes sense to try polling first? Dunno for sure
[17:59:25] <Warr1024> In my case I'm pretty confident that my reverse proxy handles websockets correctly, so if those are more efficient I'd want to make sure they're used first.
[17:59:45] <xnaas> Having websockets first...I run into a lot of issues on iOS tbh, it could be the cause, might not be. 
[18:00:06] <xnaas> I know Apple (iOS Safari) and websockets have had lots of issues in the past. 
[18:00:52] <Warr1024> Hmm, okay, I don't use iOS or Safari anywhere ... I was just wondering if there might be other unexpected consequences...

[18:25:27] <bookworm> that's gonna be rather verbose
[18:27:27] <bookworm> as far as logging of messages is concerned, yes TL doesn't log errors to the dbs as that's not something which is IRC traffic. Same as we don't log it if you enter a unknown command or mess up the syntax
[18:27:51] <bookworm> there's also a bunch 8f message types that's not logged... wallops, mode replies etc
[18:29:02] <Warr1024> Seems like ideally stuff like that could go to a separate log.  It may not be messages, but it's activity, and important context.  If something doesn't show up in my message log is that because it wasn't said there, or because I wasn't connected at the time?
[18:29:41] <bookworm> we do log joins, you'll see those
[18:30:48] <Warr1024> Yeah, that works for channels, I guess.  Not so useful for private conversations maybe.  Would also like to have a record of server announcements at least...
[18:31:18] <bookworm> yeah, have to check why that was inhibited, doesn't make much sense for me either
[18:31:20] <Warr1024> I mean it just seems like anything that's important enough to display in a window would be logged.
[18:31:31] <bookworm> not really
[18:31:45] <Warr1024> Especially since it would make the experience consistent in that restarts are more or less transparent as far as scrollback goes.
[18:32:04] <bookworm> TL uses it a lot for "you messed up, try again" kind of messages and they don't make sense later
[18:32:57] <bookworm> almost every user interaction we have is by the means of a synthesized "message"

[18:33:26] <bookworm> logs as you call them are meant for IRC message logs, not TL usage
[18:33:44] <bookworm> if we are talking sqlite amd text logs
[18:34:10] <bookworm> the server log would be what's spewed into stdout when TL runs
[18:34:26] <bookworm> and has completely different semantics and usage
[18:34:58] <Warr1024> Yeah, probably it's because they're also the mechanism by which text in windows persists across restarts.  It's at least a Least Surprise violation to have them be so selective.
[18:35:03] <bookworm> (and frankly besides startup we don't emit much there I think)

[18:36:42] <Warr1024> TL does a good job of not loading a bunch of log junk until it's actually asked for, so I'd at least like the option to log everything visible and I could manage my own log cleanout if I really wanted to.  Wouldn't have to be on by default necessarily.
[18:37:12] <bookworm> it does actually a very bad job at that
[18:37:25] <bookworm> it just tries to hide it from you
[18:37:30] <Warr1024> Okay, granted there are aspects of it not so great
[18:38:02] <Warr1024> but it's not like my entire 700MB sqlite file gets read out every time I open a client, at least I'm fairly sure... :-|
[18:41:44] <Warr1024> Either way a few network status messages aren't gonna make much difference ... and I guess I should probably setup some kind of archival process...
[18:42:50] <xnaas> Yeah, I keep meaning to deal with my sqlite shit someday. Basically no reason to keep logs past 1 year for any server other than my own.
[18:43:53] <Warr1024> My tentative plan is to dump out rows to some sane serialization format like jsonl or something, and then xzip chunks of those.  The server I have TL hosted on restarts weekly, so I can just run the process right before each startup.

[22:29:28] <bookworm> that you shutdown TL prior to doing that should be delf explaining really
[22:29:48] <bookworm> you never migrate something that's still running, certainly no DB
[22:30:19] <bookworm> and if you do, use a fs that can do snapshots so that you have a consistent state
[22:30:47] <bookworm> cp -r certainly won't do if anything is still actively writing to it
