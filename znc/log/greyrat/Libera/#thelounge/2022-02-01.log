[00:27:58] <d76d5436757> Of course! Thanks for all of the input bookworm MaxLeiter fnutt. I try to stay away from JS but this feature was just too tempting and nobody was working on it.
[00:28:11] <bookworm> good plan
[00:28:36] <bookworm> (sending the PR and avoiding JS, both)
[00:37:51] <bookworm> MaxLeiter: johncs all deps from sindresorhus (file-type, filenamify, got, read-chunk) are frozen in time forever... the dev has strong opinons on ESM and forces it in their packages. Considering that I've never looked into ESM vs commonJS, what's your opinon there? Do we need to find some other things that can do whatever those packages are doing?
[00:38:25] <bookworm> or can we switch to ESM?

[00:42:38] <bookworm> oh, add chalk to the mix, that's the same dude
[00:45:52] <johncs> i'm not sure i totally understand, but i don't see any issue with changing to esm. i think all of the node versions we support support it anyways.
[00:47:16] <bookworm> barely, node 12 has it behind a future toggle... --experimental-modules
[00:48:06] <bookworm> re my comment above, the dev mentioned major version bumped all their packages and made them ESM only
[00:48:18] <bookworm> and that's quite a lot for us

[00:53:04] <johncs> there's not a lot that will be difficult to deal with i suspect. inline imports are different in that they'll be promise based instead, but I suspect we can figure everything out alright.
[00:53:32] <johncs> do you think we can get away with making it so that node has to be started with a new command-line-argument on the versions of node that require --experimental-modules?
[00:53:50] <johncs> because there's also a project we can use for those older versions at least: https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm
[00:53:53] <bookworm> honestly? Just version bump node
[00:54:06] <johncs> ah yeah, that's fair
[00:54:12] <johncs> 12 is pretty old
[00:54:47] <bookworm> realistically speaking all affected distros that would mind ship an EOL version of node in the repo anyhow and you need to get the one from nodeforge
[00:55:01] <bookworm> and then it really doesn't matter whether you pull in the last LTS or the oldest

[00:57:56] <johncs> for sure. sounds like just transitioning to esm will be fine then. i'm not sure whether we'll have to transition all-at-once or not. There's an option in package.json that you need to flip to import your own stuff using the import syntax, and I'm not sure if that makes it so that require doesn't work.

[22:59:17] <timsan> I don't use apache or nginx, just straight https on Port 9000
[22:59:27] <xnaas> The best and most permanent solution is to use a reverse proxy like apache or nginx.
