[02:07:47] <TJ-> Exterminador: there's a generic interface to sound devices using snd_hda_intel. To actually use the devivce behind that interface there needs to be a codec driver and the pinctl (connections) need configuring. Your kernel log doesn't show those last two things, which makes me think that device has a unique codec

[08:43:05] <tomreyn> NeilRG: you can prevent it from using it as an input source, and you can mute it. you can't prevent it from connecting to the mic, because Ubuntu is a software, the connection is in hardware.
[08:43:36] <NeilRG> tomreyn, great, I just need to prevent it from using it as an input source, since it puts my headphones into headset mode

[08:45:25] <NeilRG> I want to keep using it as an output device, just prevent the microphone from being used

[08:46:40] <Croran> i think it chokes on unicode/emoticons and that's the source of some of the line spacing issues.
[08:46:42] <tomreyn> NeilRG: you can use pavucontrol to select input sources, set volumes, and mute sinks
[08:47:05] <Croran> anyone have a recommendation for a good IRC client for ubuntu? preferably without third-party repos?
[08:47:12] <Croran> something simple preferably.
[08:47:30] <NeilRG> tomreyn, when I plug in the USB device, it connects to everything by default.  I want to change this connection behavior
[08:47:33] <tomreyn> NeilRG: but if thi sis a matter of selecting the right bluetooth audio profile (headset vs. headphones) you may need to look for a device specific solution
[08:47:35] <sarnold> NeilRG: there's a ton of flexibility in alsa and pulse, this might be easy or it might be hard, I'm not sure :) this guide may help you find something useful https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2021/02/07/audio-stack.html
[08:47:55] <sarnold> Croran: I've been using irssi for ~18 years, I like it pretty well. weechat is also popular.
[08:48:18] <Croran> sarnold: good. what do you like about it? is it simple? polished?
[08:48:53] <NeilRG> sarnold, thanks, this is quite complicated for me :/
[08:49:03] <sarnold> Croran: it can handle a few hundred channels / queries and a dozen networks without any real trouble. there's loads of scripts available if you want to customize something, and writing your own isn't terrible if you want to
[08:49:08] <sarnold> NeilRG: aye :(
[08:49:26] <NeilRG> is there some keyword I can google for the autoconnection behavior to microphones?
[08:49:52] <Croran> sarnold: ok but what if i don't want to customize anything. is it good out of the box? complies with ubuntu's theme? has no annoying little issues?
[08:50:57] <sarnold> Croran: it'll probably require a bit of configuration out of the box, https://irssi.org/documentation/startup/ describes many of the common things

[10:07:23] <alkisg> It might be because you have many tabs in chrome, or it might even be because there's a memory leak elsewhere, wasting your RAM

[11:48:46] <cetex> afaik

[12:15:24] <cetex> TJ-: Yeah. Maybe not. But i'm pretty sure it does reach that in my scenarios as there's no matching GTLD.. So then the question is, recompile systemd or add 50 hostnames to /etc/hosts. :)

[12:24:10] <cetex> developing a service where we have global + regional apis / hostnames + each customer has their own subdomain so it quickly grows to a long list of hostnames we need to support, and we want to test everything locally.
[12:24:29] <TJ-> cetex: in which case use a DNS server!
[12:25:09] <cetex> Yeah.. Was looking into this to see if it was possible to do without dnsmasq. Don't want dnsmasq on my laptop so i think i'll just add them to /etc/hosts like before.
[12:25:32] <TJ-> BIND with views (split DNS) can do that
[12:26:02] <TJ-> dnsmasq is often already installed as a dependency of network-manager
[12:26:20] <TJ-> or libvirtd, and a few other common tools
[12:26:39] <cetex> Not a dependency for network-manager for some time on ubuntu
[12:26:59] <cetex> ubuntu switched to systemd-resolved quite some time ago.
[12:27:30] <TJ-> cetex: it's a recommends for network-manager so is usually pulled in by default

And even if I statically assign one, and even though it can ping e.g. the router and some (not all) of the other devices on the network, any attempt of doing TCP over IPv4 just fails, whether to the Internet or on the LAN. I've verified that netfilter/iptables is empty, I've

[15:46:15] <madduck> without openvpn, I would not be able to look into this. I mean, consider this: the machine does not get a v4 lease by DHCP, but v6 works. So OpenVPN manages to establish a tunnel via v6, which allows me to SSH into the machine. So I am now debugging an IPv4 stack while logged into the machine on the other side of the world (I am in NZ, machine in DE), because OpenVPN-over-v6 is remarkably stable ;)
[15:47:10] <tomreyn> you could also try booting an earlier kernel

[18:49:27] <not-a-boxer> I was upgrading to a higher Ubuntu release

[18:56:39] <TJ-> not-a-boxer: OK, it's pretty simple. When the GRUB menu shows hilight an entry (the default will do) and press 'e' to edit it. Then navigate down to the line beginning "linux ...".

[19:07:33] <TJ-> not-a-boxer: oh, you typed literally "resume"? that was not what I meant. When its in maintenance mode, tpying "exit" or pressing Ctrl+D should exit that shell and return to the recovery menu and/or continue booting normally. If it returns to the recovery menu you'd choose "resume"

[21:16:02] <Mathisen> ash_worksi, yes and no.. you can setup keybinds in i3 to do whatever you need it to in an "easy" way in the config ~/config/i3/i3config
[21:16:44] <ash_worksi> Mathisen: like, if some application triggers a prompt I could could use a keybinding to confirm it?

[23:50:00] <agvantibo> Hello. I am trying to connect a nokia e50 to my Ubuntu 21.04 via bluetooth. So far they see each other and communicate (kinda), but my Nokia prompts for a "16-digit passcode",  a google search yields no results, 0000, 1234, 1111 and their respective 16-digit counterparts also fail). Output below...
