[22:02:16] <glik22> is there consensus on whether or not to use gofmt as part of the build/test process? i see a lot of repos using the golangci-lint github action but not with gofmt turned on.
[22:06:00] <Sam> They say not to, but I disagree. Just do it and if it ever becomes a problem disable it temporarily.

[22:06:37] <Sam> I mean, it is more work when you end uo with two versions of go that revert eachothers changes, but it's worth knowing imo
[22:07:35] <Tv_> the only time that hurts is when there's two versions of gofmt in wide use
[22:07:44] <Tv_> they have changed the layout
[22:07:56] <Tv_> if you control what your developers run, then it's not much of an issue
[22:08:09] <Tv_> me, i can't even `git add` things without gofmting them
[22:08:17] <glik22> Sam: i'm not quite sure i follow. who say's don't use it? and it just feels wrong to me that you could check in really weirdly formatted code.
[22:08:19] <j416> could also just use a sane setup
[22:09:06] <glik22> Tv_: that's one way, but i've found it difficult to ensure an entire team sets up pre-commit or other hooks. j416 do you have an example of a sane setup?
[22:09:31] <Sam> The faq on the go site says not to IIRC, or something like that. I just remember the official stance being "don't use gofmt in CI"
[22:09:32] <glik22> i'm new to go and we're ealy on in a project. i like getting this tooling setup as early as possible.
[22:09:34] <Tv_> glik22: then you'll likely also find it hard to ensure they run the same version of gofmt, when things change
[22:09:47] <jimeh> personally I actually lint with gofumpt even, for app repos that build a binary/docker image, everything is just one version of Go, for package repos that run tests against multiple Go versions, I run the linting checks against the oldest supported Go version only...
[22:09:56] <glik22> Tv_: unless i use something like github actions which will always use the same version
[22:09:59] <Tv_> Sam: flip side, the go core devs are notorious for committing un-formatted code
[22:10:11] <Sam> I run it and when it's broken I just add a commit fmting their changes before merge.
[22:10:14] <j416> glik22: configure the editor to run gofmt on save
[22:10:30] <Tv_> glik22: and break builds for everyone who isn't on the same version; upgrading what your CI does makes for a bad day for everyone
[22:10:40] <j416> Tv_: wat, really
[22:10:47] <j416> why'd the commit un-gofmt'ed code >.>
[22:10:53] <j416> s/the/they/
[22:10:56] <glik22> this is a very interesting discussion :)
[22:11:04] <Tv_> j416: manual steps will *always* be left out
[22:11:14] <Tv_> hence editor-save + git-add for me
[22:11:24] <glik22> yea, it's easy to commit unformatted code by accident or negligence
[22:11:38] <j416> Tv_: ah, they don't have it automatic o_O
[22:11:40] <j416> weird.
[22:12:09] <Tv_> `*.go filter=gofmt`, `[filter "gofmt"]\nclean = gofmt` is all you need
[22:12:14] <glik22> i guess i'm too new to go to understand differnt versions etc. i'm coming from a python background where it's the norm to have the ci pipeline run a linter.
[22:12:36] <Tv_> glik22: sure, if you make it a *lint* and not a fail...
[22:12:39] *** Joins: lauraaah (uid156848@id-156848.charlton.irccloud.com)
[22:12:45] <Tv_> but then you've just added noise
[22:13:12] <glik22> Tv_: in our python builds the build fails. maybe there's a way to auto-commit the linted code. not sure.
[22:14:19] <jimeh> personally I would always run a linter as part of CI, and I would probably consider a litn fail a CI fail, but I'm a pretty picky person... lol
[22:14:34] <Tv_> golint explicitly has false positives
[22:14:47] <Tv_> go vet doesn't
[22:14:57] <Tv_> staticcheck is.. in between, but mostly exactly what you want
[22:15:14] <jimeh> thankfully I really haven't run into many false positives so far :)
[22:15:19] <glik22> jimeh: i tend to agree with you
[22:15:36] <glik22> the go faq leads to this https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#gofmt
[22:15:45] <Sam> me too. I do something like this on most projects: https://git.sr.ht/~samwhited/xmpp/tree/main/item/.builds/validate.yml
[22:16:11] <jimeh> I'm coming from a Ruby background myself, where rubocop is the linter of choice, which has thousands of configuration options, so pretty much every project has it's own rules, and most projects have a rubocop todo file that's +200 lines long :P
[22:16:42] <jimeh> gofmt and it's complete lack of configuration was one of the main reasons Go initially grabbed my attention years ago :D

[23:28:44] <src> interestingly a large const number with decimals can't overflow a float
[23:28:55] <src> but a large whole number can overflow an int mhmhm
[23:29:31] <src> https://play.golang.org/p/35CShWSgbh_H
[23:29:33] <lungaro2> is there a way to skip a single package when using ... with a test?
[23:29:36] <Tv_> define "overflowing a float", they just become Inf
[23:30:06] <Tv_> lungaro2: no. some people resort to go list and grep, some use build tags, some filter by test name
[23:30:25] <lungaro2> its stupid generated code I didn't write that has tests
[23:30:26] <lungaro2> lol
[23:30:32] <lungaro2> i might just trash it
[23:30:50] <Tv_> lungaro2: i often do a if ... { t.Skip thing
[23:31:06] <Tv_> lungaro2: e.g. my slow integration tests don't run unless you ask for trouble
[23:31:23] <Tv_> subtests make controlling that pleasant
[23:31:57] <fizzie> Judging from the sample code, "overflow" in this case meant "loss of precision", which I guess is kind of a given when the input is a decimal constant, given that no binary floating type can represent 0.1 exactly.
[23:32:23] *** Quits: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech) (Quit: Bye.)
[23:33:11] <fizzie> If you make a too large untyped floating constant, it is still a compile-time error (instead of turning into Inf) to try to assign it to where it don't fit: https://play.golang.org/p/HNeZGPfBC_M
[23:39:17] *** Quits: Garb00 (~Garb0@user/garb0) (Quit: Garb00)
[23:40:00] <src> fizzie: so floats handle precision with some freedom, but can still overflow if the value itself is too large
