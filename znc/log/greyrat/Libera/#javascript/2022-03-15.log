[01:20:56] <mikrosis> the other stuff is half a decade old
[01:21:28] <Dorward> mikrosis: React is geared around managing data for rendering in the browser viewport. The Notification API is for displaying messages outside of the viewport when the page isn't even loaded. There's not a whole lot of reason for React and Notifications to interact without each other at all.
[01:22:16] <mikrosis> Dorward: well, reducers, app state and such
[01:23:00] <mikrosis> also because it should also work with iOS Safari (that doesn't support Web Notification API or Push API) I use SSE for notifications. And there I play a sound. The best thing closest to a native app. And the other browsers should still use the Web Notification API.

[01:49:51] <Maxdamantus> (But if I'm designing an API and I want to allow multiple requests at the same time, I'm just going to make one type of request that takes an array, rather one request that takes a singleton and another that takes an array)

[01:53:33] <buu> Return an array of responses =]
[01:54:06] <buu> I mean, isn't this the point of keep-alive
[01:54:16] <Maxdamantus> Yes, naturally, but should the HTTP status code reflect the outcome of any of those array members?
[01:55:40] <Maxdamantus> It's sort of related to `keep-alive`, but it will very likely still be suboptimal to rely on that, unless you've got pipelining enabled.
[01:56:03] <Maxdamantus> Servers are known to implement pipelining incorrectly, so HTTP clients normally have it disabled by default.
[01:56:43] <Maxdamantus> It is also addressed by using http2 rather than HTTP/1.

[01:58:29] <Maxdamantus> And I'm not sure I've ever read an API that specifies whether the server supports pipelining, so I've only ever enabled it in cases where I'm talking to something internal.

[02:03:55] *** Quits: vbgunz (~vbgunz@35.141.71.47) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[02:05:18] <Maxdamantus> also, even if you do have pipelining enabled, that's still suboptimal because with pipelining enabled you need to hold onto the request until you get a response.
[02:05:32] *** Joins: vbgunz (~vbgunz@35.141.71.47)
[02:06:37] <Maxdamantus> (since when making pipelined requests, those requests can be visibly ignored by the server returning an earlier `Connection: close`, in which case you should resend the later requests)
[02:08:04] <Maxdamantus> That's possibly one reason to not enabled pipelining even on internal services where you know it's implemented correctly, though I haven't looked into whether any clients do the optimisation of dropping the request data for non-pipelined requests.

[04:51:42] <dea_> do you think is there anyway to know if an object is a Proxy
[04:52:41] <ljharb> dea_: it depends
[04:52:48] <ljharb> dea_: on what it's claiming to be a proxy *for*
[04:53:05] <ljharb> dea_: if it's claiming to be a proxy for a non-array builtin, you can! if not, you can't, and that's part of the design
[04:53:11] <dea_> mostly on native libs on browsers
[04:53:26] <ljharb> dea_: oh also, if it's claiming to be a proxy for something that has private fields, or uses identity to track things, then you can tell, but that's pretty niche
[04:53:29] <ljharb> dea_: such as?
[04:53:49] <ljharb> do note that using Proxy outside of a membranes implementation is an obscene misuse of Proxy, since that's all it was designed for - so don't do that

[09:15:49] <EdFletcher> yeah there ain’t no terraforming this place, not with our current pop growth anyway. gotta find new rocks.
[09:15:56] <ashnur> planets are dangerous and difficult
[09:16:05] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: "in a vacuum" is a term people use when they want to be specific about how it can be measured.
[09:16:14] <EdFletcher> ashnur: this one is no different 😜

[09:16:56] <EdFletcher> ashnur: Haha can’t argue with that, it is unarguably the best planet yet still full of risks
[09:17:04] <ljharb> ashnur: it's the act of surviving away from earth that matters

[09:17:40] <ljharb> ashnur: not sure i agree, but it's irrelevant. if we can survive in a ship to get to a planet, we can survive in a ship

[09:18:54] <ashnur> ljharb, you mean you are not aware, but that doesn't mean I have  to forget too
[09:18:56] <ljharb> ashnur: perhaps, but that's not an opinion i've heard espoused, and either way is NOT one that is proven
[09:19:00] <xisop> we have to wait for that worm hole to be opened near saturn
[09:19:07] <ThePendulum> I'd think we'd have to leave the solar system to get out of whatever situation would require us the evacuate earth
[09:19:09] <dave0> science can't even make a toupee that doesn't get laughs

[09:24:50] <EdFletcher> theskillwithin: yup great point, even the initial lift is extraordinarily expensive (as ljharb noted earlier) and that won't support actual colonization for like ten years anyway. it's a long game for sure.

[09:25:19] <ashnur> ljharb, basically, even if you actually want to colonize planets, first you have to develop safe space habitats, that can transport you there

[09:25:56] <systemfault> sickdyd: Haha
[09:26:08] <ashnur> ljharb, so if you have space habitats, that gives you more diversification than another planet
[09:26:12] <ljharb> ashnur: um, no?
[09:26:20] <ljharb> ashnur: that gives you the ability to support a very fixed population

[10:05:48] <systemfault> I watched a serious documentary about Mars called Total Recall, it's totally possible to create oxygen by melting Mars' ice core!
[10:05:48] <ljharb> and terraforming would include increasing a magnetic field and also atmosphere for radiation shielding

[10:05:58] <ashnur> you can't increase the magnetic field just like that
[10:06:08] <ljharb> ashnur: nor can you terraform just like that
[10:06:20] <theskillwithin> umm I think elon musk would have thought of that, we'll be fine
[10:06:34] <Maxdamantus> Terraforming will be a lot easier than creating a magnetosphere though.
[10:06:36] <ashnur> it's a matter of degrees. the differences are measured in orders of magnitude

[10:07:29] <ljharb> and yes, i agree without a sufficiently strong magnetic field, a planet wouldn't be suitable for life
[10:08:01] <ashnur> just because it's easy to say and write, doesn't mean there aren't differences in real life, and just because the first step is not achievable, doesn't mean we shouldn't care that one of the steps is practically impossible
[10:08:25] <ashnur> with the effort to build a magnetic field for Mars, we could probably build an armada of artificial moons
[10:08:42] <ljharb> each of those would need a magnetic field too
[10:08:46] <ashnur> nope?
[10:08:52] <ashnur> you don't live on the surface
[10:09:32] <ljharb> then the same could be said of a planet, including mars
[10:09:52] <ashnur> there are differences
[10:09:56] <ljharb> such as?

[10:11:14] <Maxdamantus> How many rocks hit Jupiter every year?
[10:11:24] <ashnur> lol, artificial moons can be moved, unlike planets, or rather, moved with less difficulty :D
[10:11:39] <theskillwithin> planets are kind of like a large rock, so its all just rocks hitting rocks
[10:11:40] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: a shitload, but a gas giant is hardly a comparison
[10:12:00] <Maxdamantus> ljharb: well, it demonstrates that more gravity means more rocks.
[10:12:13] <ljharb> it's a tradeoff; the larger the place you live, the more things will hit it, and the less it will matter that they do

[11:02:32] <systemfault> Hi
[11:02:37] <systemfault> airbnb
[11:02:47] <thojanssens> I know about AirBnB style guide and JS Standard Style: https://standardjs.com/index.html#why-should-i-use-javascript-standard-style
[11:02:55] <thojanssens> systemfault, what do you think about the latter?
[11:03:27] <systemfault> Well, I believe that "standard" not forcing semi-colons is bad.
[11:03:44] <thojanssens> ouch... you got me already convinced if they don't enforce semi colons
[11:03:49] <systemfault> BTW, "standard" is just a name here... it's not standard in any way
[11:04:05] <thojanssens> ehhh... another reason to ignore then
[11:04:12] <systemfault> thojanssens: They do have a version with semi-colons, it's just not the default one
[11:04:32] <systemfault> This one https://github.com/standard/semistandard
[11:04:42] <thojanssens> yeah nah i'll go with airbnb

[11:27:00] <Cork> *have no defined*
[11:27:17] <Decker> the async function returns a promise anyway  - you might not have to wrap it in another promise
[11:27:18] <farn> Promise.all doesn't start promises. They start when they're created
[11:27:30] <Decker> since it's own promise might be enough for the resolve
[11:28:08] <Decker> just return the value from the function
[11:28:13] <farn> yeah, are you maybe looking for `Promise.all([someAsyncFunction(), someOtherAsyncFunction()])`?

[14:46:45] <matsaman> usually I let the story tellers tell me what they want to tell me

[14:46:51] <han-solo> `fetch(..).then(res => res.json()).then(data => ...)`
[14:46:53] <han-solo> or use await
[14:47:14] <Folsgaard> tried await but gave some error about async.
[14:47:37] <han-solo> `const res = await fetch(...); const data = await res.json();` with proper error handling
[14:47:43] <Folsgaard> Man been programming since mid 90's JS is the only language to give me troubles, its syntax is just so foreign compared to C like languages
[14:48:13] <han-solo> hrm, the onChange seems like it has to be a normal function, if yes, then just use the `.then`
[14:48:16] <Folsgaard> ty han-solo will tinker
[14:48:47] <matsaman> Folsgaard: it's pretty random based on whatever particular vintage of feature you're using, indeed

[18:19:42] <tokie> is there a library that wraps console.log with a logging framework that has toggleable log levels/filters/etc?
[18:20:17] <tokie> it's always confusing searching for this kinda thing on npm because it's difficult to know what is meant for the browser or not

[18:24:36] <austincheney> tokie, here is how I did it:  https://github.com/prettydiff/share-file-systems/blob/master/lib/browser/localhost.ts#L25-L55
[18:25:12] <austincheney> tokie, I wrapped console.log in the browser in a function that reports the logged artifacts to the terminal where you can do whatever with them
[18:25:48] <austincheney> tokie, in most cases that is fine, but in some cases it can result in an endless loop that blocks other operations.  You just have to know the limitations of your own application

[18:34:35] <austincheney> blueagain, in fact the only interest in the application, as far as I know, is in front-end developers examining how an OS GUI in the browser works and how I achieve 120ms page load including state restoration

[20:07:26] <trafficjam> bit stuck, can't decide if i should keep trying to get both libraries to place nice, or to rewrite the react-checkbox-tree for chakra-ui
[20:07:32] <trafficjam> *play nice
[20:08:59] <trafficjam> specifically the issue is that the <Checkbox /> (chakra ui) component's state does not get toggled when clicking on the react-checkbox-tree's <label> elements

[21:28:30] <samsch> I replaced the Checkbox with a simple debug component, and it looks like it should work
[21:29:42] <samsch> Chakra docs seem to show `isChecked` for the Checkbox prop?
[21:30:13] <samsch> I think that might be the issue
[21:30:14] <trafficjam> correct
[21:30:58] <samsch> If you change your code to use isChecked, does that fix it?

[21:47:20] <systemfault> buu: A thread is a unit of parallelism, a channel is a way to communicate between threads (A bit like a blocking queue)
[21:47:37] <systemfault> Some languages have small differences... but the general idea is that
[21:48:25] <systemfault> When I say "communicate between threads", I'm not being "right"... they're usually used to communicate between coroutines
[21:48:56] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[21:49:06] <systemfault> And while coroutines can be backend by kernel threads, they can also be backed by lightweight "green threads"
[21:50:09] <buu> systemfault: haha
[21:50:30] <buu> systemfault: That reminds me of larry wall's quote about the difference between a script and a program

[21:55:49] <stenno> i would say so
[21:55:50] <buu> I think so
[21:55:52] <systemfault> Or it's just an idea that was added on top to make it more practical
[21:55:57] <buu> Eh
[21:56:00] <systemfault> Fair enough

[21:56:06] <sheetjs> people join a forum
[21:56:14] <buu> But I think people generally assume new threads will be constantly created
[21:56:17] <buu> often based on topic
[21:56:36] <sheetjs> threads represent individual conversations within the forum and it has a natural ending inasfar as most individual discussions have a natural ending
[21:56:52] <systemfault> sheetjs: Said like that, it makes sense
[21:56:53] <stenno> well but its still different than a channel
[21:57:06] <buu> If you look at just this "channel" then it's made up of a number of conversations that ebb and flow
[21:57:09] <buu> Like this one =]
[21:57:11] <stenno> a channel will not end because a discussion ends
[21:57:32] <buu> So would the channel benefit if this particular discussion was somehow hidden/minimized/etc ?
[21:58:25] <stenno> its part of the natural channel conversation
[21:59:00] <sheetjs> discord uses "thread" to refer to deeper discussions within a channel.  it's a relatively new feature and currently has an inactivity timer
[21:59:18] <buu> Yeah, so does slack and teams
[21:59:21] <buu> and I find them incredibly annoying
[21:59:26] <buu> But I'm not sure why
[22:00:11] <systemfault> I'm not used to that either... I don't like it because I actually like to easily follow multiple concurrent discussions
[22:00:15] <sheetjs> conversations don't evolve in a tree fashion as envisaged by threads
[22:00:20] <systemfault> But then, I'm just an old IRC kid
[22:00:36] <buu> Yeah
[22:00:40] <sheetjs> it just all melds together, and the irc model is probably closest to how we understand and communicate with the world
[22:00:44] <buu> Maybe it's the lack of visibility
[22:01:15] <buu> Or the enforced and somewhat artificial boundaries?
[22:01:33] <buu> Certainly having 3-4 conversations going on inside a channel is basically impossible

[22:02:25] <sheetjs> it's like the difference between excel and databases
[22:02:45] <sheetjs> for many uses cases, both suffice, and arguably people should use databases
[22:03:03] <buu> I feel like the main difference there is just ui
[22:03:08] <stenno> so you can have 3-4 discussions at the same time, people usually know which statement belongs to which conversation, even though it might get confusing
[22:03:25] <sheetjs> Excel has inherent flexibility, while databases have inherent power from the limitations
[22:03:50] <buu> really?
[22:04:29] <sheetjs> it's easy to go off-schema and add a random comment to a row in an Excel database
[22:04:43] <Rockwood> sheetjs, o/
[22:04:45] <stenno> power mostly means performance maybe?
[22:04:47] <sheetjs> on the other side, databases will catch a class of common error that Excel won't
[22:05:02] <stenno> ok and robustness
[22:05:08] <sheetjs> power means you can build atop databases, leaning on the restrictions
[22:05:14] <sheetjs> twitter API for example
[22:05:29] <sheetjs> had this hilarious field whose values were 0, 1, 2, ..., 99, "100+"

[22:05:42] <stenno> blep

[22:07:43] <buu> One of my formative ephiphanies about technology and ux and so forth was how wikipedia in specific ended up working with actual users. My approach as a programmer would have been to try to create these super specific UIs designed around the intentions of the users, e.g. a form with like 10 fields for putting in details about an author or a complicated system to input geopgrahical data for countries

[22:08:01] <sheetjs> "power" doesn't just mean "performance" in context -- consumers of the data benefit from restrictions, while producers of the data benefit from flexibility
[22:08:15] <buu> It would have been very efficient and formalized and prevented mistakes and allowed for lots of data reuse
[22:08:30] <buu> And no one would have ever used it
[22:09:13] <buu> Instead wikipedia just had basically a giant textbox with the ability to link and some formatting codes and people built these really complicated systems
[22:09:50] <buu> And sure people are copy and pasting stuff all over the place and things go out of date occasionally and the same information is in slightly different formats in different pages
[22:09:53] <sheetjs> the giant textbox optimizes for production
[22:09:57] <buu> Yep
[22:10:18] <buu> This is part of my thesis about why powershell is dumb
[22:11:08] <sheetjs> CSV is successful for the same reasons
[22:11:22] <buu> Every so often people (programmers) look at bash and go, "you know what the problem with bash is? It's not rigorous and formalized enough!" then they came up with some super pedantic overly specified language that's easy for computers to handle
[22:12:10] <buu> It's easy to think "if only every <bash> tool output well formed json then pipes would be even better!"
[22:12:25] <buu> But of course none of the tools would even exist because nobody wants to write a program that has to output json
[22:12:48] <buu> We write programs to solve problems for humans and humans very rarely have problems that involve wanting to see a page of json spewed at them
[22:13:05] <sheetjs> jq is great

[23:09:55] <systemfault> So, in a Java context... which is somewhat similar to JS, it's the "reference" is that copied by value

[23:10:36] <systemfault> nwoob: So, depending from what language you're from.. reference could mean something different
[23:11:27] <nwoob> systemfault: but defination should be consistant. Pass by reference means passing reference of a variable so that if value of variable is changed in a function then it is also reflected outside the function.
[23:11:39] <systemfault> That's the C++ version.
[23:11:44] <systemfault> And no, JS doesn't support them
[23:12:05] <nwoob> We cannot have multiple defination of a programming concept that changes by language
[23:12:24] <stenno> we can, and we do
[23:12:29] <Maxdamantus> nwoob: in C++, you can define a function like `void foo(int &x) { x = 4; }` then when you call that function `foo(y);` it will modify the `y` variable.
[23:12:32] <nwoob> that's not good
[23:12:34] <systemfault> We do, all the time. The C standard mentions the idea of "object" but it doesn't refer to OOP

[23:13:01] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Quit: The Time is Over)
[23:13:09] <Maxdamantus> nwoob: JavaScript doesn't allow you to define functions that modify their argument variables. Whenever using a variable as an argument to a function in JS, only the value is passed.
[23:13:34] <ljharb> !pass by reference @ nwoob
[23:13:34] <jellobot> nwoob, JavaScript has call-by-value semantics in which references to objects are considered to be a type of value. Direct assignment to an argument will never be visible outside of a function. For a detailed explanation, see: https://web.archive.org/web/20161005155047/http://www.jon-carlos.com/2013/is-javascript-call-by-value-or-call-by-reference/
[23:13:42] <nwoob> Maxdamantus: well that's passs by reference on your example so ofcoure it does change varialbe
[23:13:42] <ljharb> nwoob: JS is not and can never be pass by reference
[23:14:09] <Maxdamantus> nwoob: in C++, yes, but you can't define such a function in JS.
[23:14:13] <ljharb> nwoob: the definition is that *assignment* inside the function is visible outside it. mutation is not assignment; assignment is not mutation.
[23:14:30] <Maxdamantus> nwoob: after the `foo(y);` call in my sample code, `y` will have value 4.
[23:14:52] <Maxdamantus> nwoob: because `foo` received a reference to the `y` variable, rather than only receiving its value. It was able to modify the `y` variable itself.

[23:16:20] <samsch> Perhaps more correctly: `obj['360']`
[23:16:24] <motsu> at the same time though, JS does not copy objects on assignment. im not the best to speak of the actual mechanics, but its bitten me before where i make an array off a bunch of objects, then modify one element in the array and they all change

[23:16:39] <ljharb> nwoob: yes, that's mutation, not assignment, and has nothing to do with the definition of pass by reference

[23:16:43] <ljharb> motsu: yes, it does copy

[23:32:29] <stagas> and for the queueMicrotask, since you want it to go at the end of the event loop for some reason, why send 5 times the same command there? again you'd want to throttle it

[23:36:13] <ljharb> stagas: you're misusing rAF if you aren't drawing all the time. the point of it is to use math on the timestamp to determine what things should look like. it's like a react component where the timestamp is the prop.

[23:41:18] <systemfault> Yup, that's why it doesn't matter if rAF is called 10 times in a frame, because they're all going to be deferred to that specific moment where the browser does its redraw
[23:41:40] <ljharb> stagas: its purpose is also for you to use the timestamp to deterministically compute whatever you need
[23:41:49] <ljharb> stagas: it shouldn't matter if it's invoked a thousand times a second or once an hour
[23:41:51] <systemfault> That why I've been telling you that if rAF is called too many times.. rAF is not the problem, it's the producer
[23:42:21] <systemfault> So... if there's something to "throttle", it would be your mousemove or whatever event you're using
[23:42:43] <stagas> but if raf is called 10 times in a frame, it's called with a callback which is costly, i don't want my draw() function to run 10 times next frame, it should run 1, so it has to also be throttled to 1 invocation per frame
[23:42:58] <systemfault> Then invoke it LESS

[23:56:56] <systemfault> If '#/definitions/MyClass' was enough or you had to specify { $ref: '#/definitions/MyClass'}
[23:57:47] <Brewster> oh yeah I missed the $ref in items
[23:57:59] <Brewster> that is the correct form
[23:58:09] <Brewster> {$ref: whatever}
[23:58:20] <systemfault> We use typescript at work... so we generate the schemas from code

[23:58:36] <Brewster> what do you use to generate the schemas?
[23:58:38] <systemfault> So I sometimes forget small details like that
[23:59:14] <systemfault> We have our own thing but it works like Typebox (https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox)  or SureType (https://github.com/grantila/suretype)
[23:59:28] <Brewster> cool
[23:59:29] <Brewster> thanks!
