[02:38:09] <Voxel> Hey all ^^
[02:38:37] <Voxel> Is it okay to say "It should be possible to successfully transfer the message?"
[02:38:41] <Voxel> Like, in the future.
[02:38:55] <Voxel> The question mark is typo.
[02:39:28] <blkshp> Yes it is.
[02:39:38] <Voxel> Like, for example: You won't have any issues transferring the message. The message is encrypted and it should be possible to successfully transfer the message.
[02:39:58] <blkshp> Should means that it is not definitely going to work,.
[02:40:03] <blkshp> But you believe it will.
[02:40:12] <Voxel> I see.
[02:40:25] <Voxel> Thank you ^^
[02:40:40] <blkshp> if you replace should with "will" that means that it will work.

[02:43:41] <Voxel> "I believe that you will transfer the message successfully"
[02:46:02] <LjL> that really does not entail "believing in them"
[02:46:05] <blkshp> What's the3 aum?
[02:46:09] <blkshp> What's the aim?
[02:46:13] <blkshp> (finger was a little to the right!)

[02:59:08] <Voxel> How would you reclarify someone's question. For example, would this work: "Is the issue that..."
[03:02:43] <StayHungry> Voxel: 'the problem is possibly with‚Ä¶', 'perhaps the problem is that‚Ä¶'
[03:02:48] <Voxel> Would this work? "I'm sorry, but just to clarify. Is transferring the encrypted message the issue?"
[03:05:56] <StayHungry> Voxel: 'Let me clarify. Message transmission is not working as you expect, right?'
[03:07:05] <Voxel> "There's an issue in transferring an encrypted message. Is that correct?"
[03:07:25] <Voxel> StayHungry, I'm trying to omit orders.
[03:07:43] <Voxel> Like, *let me*.
[03:09:48] <StayHungry> 'let me' is suggesting that you are asking for permission or an opportunity to do something
[03:11:58] <StayHungry> e.g. ‚Äî Let me open the door for you. ‚Äî Sure, go ahead.

[20:43:38] <LjL> okay, that's not how "have children" in english works
[20:43:43] <darsie> Oh, so huf was wrong.
[20:43:53] <LjL> no
[20:44:05] <LjL> you are wrong in thinking that "having children" means only the STATE of having them
[20:44:21] <darsie> Can to have children mean to make children?
[20:44:30] <LjL> yessssssssss
[20:44:35] <darsie> But huf said no.
[20:44:42] <huf> never saw it used that way
[20:45:12] <LjL> this seems like a waste of time.
[20:45:16] <huf> I guess "let's have a child" and "let's make a child" are similar
[20:45:23] <huf> LjL: most of darsie's questions of this sort are
[20:45:30] <huf> this one's one of the better ones
[20:45:55] <darsie> Ok, I'll stick with have.
[20:46:05] <LjL> https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/have-a-child  do you see it says "to be OR BECOME" a parent?
[20:46:11] <huf> at least it's about English, not basic decency or common sense :)

[20:47:40] <darsie> I meant his response to my initial quesition.
[20:48:13] <darsie> But yes, that, too.
[20:48:14] <huf> yes. have is from the start of birthing to actually raising the child
[20:48:17] <huf> make is before pregnancy
[20:48:18] <huf> and weird
[20:48:30] <huf> that's the range of meanings these things have
[20:48:54] <darsie> Maybe I should say don't conceive children.
[20:49:16] <darsie> .w conceive
[20:49:18] <tinsoldier> conceive ‚Äî Verb: 1. (transitive) To develop an idea; to form in the mind; to plan; to devise; to originate., 2. (transitive) To understand (someone).(intransitive or transitive) To become pregnant (with)., 3. To generate or engender; to bring into being. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conceive

[20:49:53] <darsie> It's ok to give birth, once you're pregnant. I just want ppl not to make children.

[20:54:03] <bin> it's not in the dictionary!

[20:54:18] <bin> someone used it... *shudder*... om social media
[20:54:30] <bin> nah equivalence isn't countable
[20:54:34] <huf> is too
[20:54:36] <bin> equivalency is countable
[20:54:43] <bin> but the plural for that is equivalencies
[20:55:19] <TimMc> "Have children" is definitely the correct phrasing here.

[20:56:04] <pussipupu> Equivalence can be countable, especially in various mathematical and logical contexts
[20:56:38] <bin> huf: within a math context, maybe, but you don't have "false equivalences"

[20:57:24] <bin> NEVER

[20:58:23] <bin> /wrist
[20:58:23] <pussipupu> That's definitely an extant usage
