[00:26:58] <companion_cube> so that's the one thing HN will not stand?
[00:28:57] <indigo> Somehow I feel like if the photos weren't scanned on the device (but in the cloud instead), they wouldn't be so upset
[00:29:11] <indigo> They can't scan in the cloud because the photos are E2E encrypted
[00:31:59] <pja> Aren’t they only scanning photos you’ve synced to the cloud?

[01:03:13] <pja> But possibly only the synced ones?
[01:09:05] <gwozniak> I suspect when I read this it will sound like a lot of screaming about things not being perfect, which seems to be all I hear from the EFF these days
[01:11:59] <bkero> The second part makes it sound like they're doing actual image analysis, not just hashing.
[01:12:24] <bkero> If you count "intentional backdoor" as "not perfect" then yes
[01:15:49] <gwozniak> Honestly, I'm at the "meh" standpoint when it comes to this stuff at this point
[01:16:58] <gwozniak> I'm a bit tired of the screeching. Maybe it's relevant and warranted, but I'm kind of screeched out
[01:18:07] <gwozniak> I'm also not convinced strong encryption for all at all times is going to make anything better
[01:18:47] <gwozniak> Doesn't mean I support constant surveillance, mind you
[01:18:57] <bkero> It's a good thing nobody listens to you, that would be a damagingly naive and misguided interpretation.
[01:19:37] <gwozniak> Maybe, but I suspect that if we had the encrypted world lots of people push for, we'd be worse off

[16:06:32] <prussian> like... the site is foss, I imagine it doesn't drift much from upstream.
[16:07:17] <prussian> i don't use apple stuff so I don't have a useful opinion or comment about what apple does.

[16:07:56] <prussian> this was years ago though.

[16:28:01] <Brekkjern> There's no real "why should you read this" unless you have the exact same problem
[16:30:27] <prussian> I find it refreshing to just show what you're doing. I don't think everything has to be well composed.
[16:30:48] <prussian> but yes, It doesn't really say anything new. it's more just a rallying cry for nix adoption.
