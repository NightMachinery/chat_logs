[08:27:19] <guiverc> have you tried using a /mnt/ (instead of /home/) ?
[08:27:30] <brombomb> I have not

[08:38:28] <brombomb> okay so a few days ago I was trying to clean up some old HDD, and I installed the ubuntu package usbmount to help auto mount USB devices
[08:38:38] <brombomb> well after a reboot that was conflicting with my fstab
[08:38:47] <brombomb> I unsinstall usbmount, rebooted and It's fixed
