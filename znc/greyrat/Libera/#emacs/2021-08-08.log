[04:57:33] <bpalmer> himesama: I don't really recommend this, but one way to use the same regular expressions as you do in emacs is to literally call emacs in batch mode with a function that does the grep
[04:58:44] <bpalmer> himesama: e.g., emacs --batch -f print-lines-matching '\bwhatever' *.txt
[04:59:09] <bpalmer> where print-lines-matching is a function you write that looks at the variable command-line-args to figure out what to do.
[05:01:23] <himesama> bpalmer: good point.  although i am using grep and xzgrep for speed, i wonder what the emacs speed is.  also i'd have to contend with a legacy script base of grep re vs. interactive or script emacs

[07:11:54] <bkhl> Well, there were other types of games that had 3D movement long before then, like Elite and so on.

[07:14:04] <rnkn> I don't think you can count either Elite or flight sims as 3D movement given they're just changing points in empty space
[07:14:32] <rnkn> the only difference with flight sims is if that point got low enough Y axis you died
[07:15:16] <edrx> anyone knows how to make vterm call a program that is not the shell _with extra arguments_?
[07:15:20] <rnkn> Descent is really the first 3D-movement-in-3D-space I can think of
[07:15:30] <edrx> for example, I can make vterm run julia by doing this:
[07:15:37] <edrx> (let ((vterm-shell "lua5.1")) (vterm))

[07:17:36] <edrx> rnkn: yes!
[07:17:38] <hodapp> it's... kind of all just changing points in space
[07:18:33] <rnkn> hodapp: well no, only if you omit the key word "empty"

[11:56:06] <susam> By the way, how many are still interested in the Mastering Emacs book club I was doing? I am going to resume that. Planning to do it every weekend and go through a few pages of the book.
[11:56:58] <Viking667> I'd love to, but I don't think I've got a physical copy. And I can't remember if there's an online version.
[11:57:24] <Viking667> (additionally, timezones really get in the way for me down here at almost the bottom of the world)
[11:57:50] <susam> That is right. A PDF copy can be bought from its website. It is expensive. But I did buy it in order to host the book club meetings. The author has granted the permission to host the book club meetings with the book on display.
[11:58:04] <susam> So I share the book on screen during the stream.

[13:22:49] <edgar-rft> we're all emacs slaves
[13:23:14] <wasamasa> well, there's been someone in here complaining about the same thing and pulling out a bug report
[13:23:21] <wasamasa> https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=49645
[13:23:25] <irek> Rogach: `(setq bookmark-fontify nil)' looks like what you need
[13:23:36] <wasamasa> > There's been so much pushback on the highlighting (in addition to it not working very well) that I'm wondering whether we should just revert it at this point.
[13:23:38] <irek> to disable that feature
[13:24:47] * edgar-rft totally forgot that ugly hilight colors are an emacs feature
[13:24:48] <herjazz> ok to ask Doom Emacs questions here?

[16:26:12] <Viking667> For example, if I were to do "some random keycombo", I'd like emacs to be brought to the front of whatever workspace I'm actually on. I think xmonad calls them scratchpads

[16:41:52] <Viking667> I want to make sure I've got correct what things I've mentioned.
[16:42:16] <Rogach> Viking667: I meant a global keybinding, I think that's doable in Gnome Shell as well.
[16:42:30] <Rogach> Not advertising Gnome Shell in any way :)
[16:42:47] <Rogach> I'm an Xmonad user myself, and no way I'm using anything else.
[16:43:07] <Viking667> Global keybindings are certainly there in Gnome Shell, it's just hooking up scratchpad as a concept. I haven't seen that done anywhere outside of xmonad
[16:43:48] <Rogach> Well, with enough xlib hackery you can do basically anything. But if you do enough xlib hackery then why just don't use xmonad ;)
[16:44:03] <Rogach> Wait, but Gnome Shell is on top of Wayland nowdays, isn't it?
[16:44:23] <Viking667> Possibly. I haven't made the move to Wayland.
[16:44:48] <Rogach> Since you're an xmonad user you're not moving to Wayland anytime soon =))

[21:08:49] <ytc> hello.  i'm using emacs-28 with native compilation.  i wonder that if compiling packages with native-comp prevents me from changing them.
[21:09:55] <ytc> since they are binary files, changing definition of a function on fly should be affectless i thought.
[21:10:01] <ytc> am i mistaken?
[21:11:22] <gnoo> i don't think it should, after all, you can override definitions in byte compiled .el files
[21:11:32] <tali713> I would assume so, not on28, myself, but I can't imagine why that would be the case.  I would assume that the newsest definition is the current definition, regarless of location.
[21:12:09] <tali713> gnoo: more than that, you can override definitions in the C files, which is rather tricky to reverse.
[21:13:03] <gnoo> ytc: a simple test case could be: open emacs -q and defun message to kill-emacs and see what happens.
[21:13:25] <ytc> so can we say that native compilation has no disadvantages rather than long compile times?
[21:14:27] <gnoo> mostly, some hiccups might occur, as some have found for debugging but those should vanish in time
