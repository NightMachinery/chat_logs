[00:38:30] <elderK> Hi all :) I've come here seeking to learn more about how I can backup Git. I'm currently running a small personal server which hosts a bunch of Git repositories. I have a basic backup system in place but I'm concerned about backing up files that might not be fully "written."
[00:39:05] <elderK> I was wondering how you guys go about backing up your Git servers? How do you make sure that when you take a copy of all the stuff, that it's truly consistent? Say, all updates have been written and such.
[00:39:31] <elderK> Someone on another channel suggested I have the system wait until there are no active git processes running. When there are none, taking an LVM snapshot, and backing up from that.
[00:39:34] <elderK> What are your thoughts? :)
[00:39:56] *** Joins: howdoi (uid224@id-224.lymington.irccloud.com)
[00:40:43] * imMute would probably just use a post-receive hook that pushes to another server.   that would get the git contents anyway.

[00:42:18] <elderK> Ideally, I'd have backups in several places. One, to USB disks. Two, to a server I have storage on. The downside of the second option is that the server isn't a VPS and I can't run Git on it. I can ssh to it, however.

[00:44:22] <ikke> If you want consistent snapshot, cloning repositories with --mirror would work best
[00:44:56] <ikke> the downside is that it's not a complete backup (missing things like configuration, reflog (if enabled), unreferenced history, hooks, etc
[00:47:14] <elderK> ikke: Would I need to perform that for each repository on a server?
[00:47:21] <ikke> yes
[00:47:43] <elderK> It'd be great if there was some safe way to atomically copy the whole area on disk where the repositories are being stored.
[00:47:50] <elderK> Provided that all operations were complete.
[00:48:03] <elderK> ikke: Also, would mirror require a recipient git server?
[00:48:17] <ikke> it would be a local clone

[01:56:16] <texasmynsted> Is it possible to set a remote with a branch prefix? Say I have an origin set like `git remote add git://foo.com/bar.git` and I want to make a remote for private branches like this
[01:56:54] <texasmynsted> `git remote add git://foo.com/bar.git/private` or something.
[01:56:56] *** Joins: ZacSharp (~ZacSharp@user/zacsharp)
[01:57:44] <texasmynsted> The idea being to be able to push a branch to a remote that is the same as origin but prefixed with something like private/myname or something.
[01:58:06] <imMute> not really. you can setup the fetch refspec to put them in something like  refs/remotes/$REMOTE_NAME/foobar/ instead of refs/remotes/$REMOTE_NAME/  but that doesn't seem to be all you want
[01:58:36] <texasmynsted> The goal being to let developers push commits to a private location each day, then later squash or otherwise re-write history before pushing they changes into the "real" branches.
[01:58:57] <imMute> they'd have to setup the tracking stuff to push to the "private" location
[01:59:14] <imMute> (you can easily set it up so the branch name on the remote is not the same as the branch name locally, but it's setup per-branch)
[02:00:08] *** Joins: hbautista (~hbautista@187.171.124.146)
[02:00:15] <texasmynsted> I am trying to reduce complexity but still let developers push work each night, and still be able to rewrite history before pushing to a real location.
[02:01:28] <texasmynsted> I could give every developer their own private copy of every repo, then they could setup a private remote for their daily changes push there daily and to the real repo when all is well.
[02:01:43] <texasmynsted> The problem with that is making a bunch of private repos
[02:02:31] <imMute> yeah that's overkill.  I just have developers push to branches prefixed with their username.  so they'd push a feature branch to "imMute/feature-foo" for example.  and then use MRs to merge those feature branches into the shared dev branch.
[02:02:38] <texasmynsted> They could nightly push to /private/myname/feature-foo or whatever but that would be a lot to remember for branching
[02:02:50] <imMute> since it's got their name on it, they know they're the "owner" of the branch and can push/rebase it all they want.
[02:03:08] <imMute> you only have to take the time when you create a new branch.  after that it becomes "git push"
[02:03:37] <imMute> the setup would be something like "git push --set-upstream origin feature-foo:imMute/feature-foo" for the previous example
[02:03:38] <texasmynsted> yeah. I have done this before with /private/myname
[02:04:23] <texasmynsted> I was just hoping there was another option these days.
[02:08:13] <texasmynsted> I suppose this is really not much of a burden really. People have plenty of local branches. It is one more step to set a prefixed remote for the local branch, and clean up after that local is no longer needed.

[12:15:03] <Guest22> Hello everyone!:)  I have a problem i get a error when i try to push my first commit to Azure. I get this Error "Error: LibGit2Sharp.LibGit2SharpException: cross host redirect not allowed" and i dont know what it means. I have tried to find a solution on Google but nothing helped me so far. Does somebody know where this error comes from?

[12:24:10] <canton7> Guest22, it looks like you're trying to push to domain1.com, and that's issuing a redirect to domain2.com, which libgit2 doesn't like
[12:24:21] *** Quits: Sulky (~Sulky@195.130.222.199) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:25:39] <canton7> Guest22, presumably you're pushing over http, of course? I'd access the url you're pushing to in a browser (with the developer console up) and just see what redirect you're getting. If it's to somewhere sensible (i.e. it looks fairly generic, and not like the address of a specific machine somewhere), you can probably just update your git config to
[12:25:39] <canton7> push there instead

[17:17:20] <ztrawhcse> f-a: sure, just check it into the repo and push it as a revision ;)
[17:18:54] <ztrawhcse> Also your site doesn't seem to have been validly rsynced, it doesn't have the .git directory
[17:19:46] <ztrawhcse> Also also: git push is like rsync except specially designed for git, so it's probably better to use it

[17:23:36] <f-a> Why does git not recognise this as a repository?
[17:28:34] <ztrawhcse> https://www.git-scm.com/docs/http-protocol#_dumb_clients
[17:29:14] <ztrawhcse> You need to do a bit of extra work if you don't have a git daemon running on the remote. I'm not positive what creates the info/refs file, actually.

[18:21:00] <ztrawhcse> f-a: I can successfully clone that repo, but I need to add .git/ to the end because that is a checked-oit repo instead of one that is created by git init --bare and pushed to
[18:21:25] <f-a> oh
[18:21:31] <f-a> I did not init it with git init bare
[18:21:33] <ztrawhcse> Also when I do clone http://ariis.it/link/repos/test-git-repo/.git/ I get an empty master branch and a valid origin/master branch
[18:21:35] <Nei> f-a: if you want to make a repo that is similar to the one github exposes, try "git clone --bare your/work/repo myrepo.git"
[18:22:02] <Nei> then in myrepo.git folder, run "git update-server-info"; then rsync the folder
[18:22:06] <f-a> let me tryyyyyyyyy
[18:22:19] <ztrawhcse> So yeah, you probably want to clone your repo with --bare into your server upload staging directory
[18:22:23] <f-a> Nei: don’t have a github repo, `git init --bare` will do, right?
[18:22:37] <Nei> you can also start a fresh repo with init --bare
[18:22:46] *** Joins: Thanatermesis (~Thanaterm@191.92.148.122)
[18:22:51] <Nei> but keep in mind you cannot "work" with a bare repo,m you have to clone it first
[18:23:01] <ztrawhcse> And then git pull in the staging directory to update from your worktree, don't use rsync
[18:23:23] <ztrawhcse> Actually you can use the post update hooks in that case ;)
[18:24:28] <Nei> the problem with using a dumb server with ftp only is that you cannot "push" to it
[18:25:19] <ztrawhcse> Yes but apparently there is a staging directory locally, which is synced using a tool that does have upload access
[18:25:35] <ztrawhcse> So you can push to the local staging directory as if it were the server :D
[18:25:40] <f-a> ok, this is wat an `init --bare` repo should look like, am I wrong? http://ariis.it/link/repos/test-git-repo/
[18:26:02] <ztrawhcse> Yes
[18:26:12] <Nei> yes but if you want to use this repo from multiple computers you will need to rsync the server side repo and cannot use the normal git pull/push
[18:26:42] <f-a> I would not use git push
[18:26:45] <f-a> but git pull would be handy
[18:27:08] <f-a> I think I understand this a little bit better, thanks everyone
[18:27:14] <ztrawhcse> Although it is missing the info/refs file you generated before.

You can use this hook to do things like make sure none of the updated references are non-fast-forwards, or to do access control for all the refs and files they’re modifying with the

[23:04:17] <CarloWood> Hello. I made quite a few changes and the 'git diff' became unpleasantly large. But the largest part is caused by renaming 'VulkanWindow' to 'SynchronousWindow'. Is there a way to have git diff ignore that change?
