[14:02:45] <amoe> I have a project that's using a CSS framework that applies global styles to 'table' elements among other things (I have to use this framework).  I am trying to override some styles in certain cases.  The framework sets 'display: flex' on 'tr' elements, I want to set them back to 'display: table-row'.
[14:03:47] <amoe> When I try to disable the framework's rules interactively in Chrome inspector, the layout looks correct, and I'm only changing the 'display' value.  But when I override them in a CSS file the layout looks different, even though I can see that the same 'display' value has been set
[14:03:55] <amoe> Wh would that happen?
[14:07:08] <thykka> amoe, your override rules' specificity is the same or lower than what the framework has?
[14:08:24] <thykka> like, if your file has "tr { display: table-row; }" and the framework has "tr { display: flex; }", whichever style element is last, wins.
[14:09:12] <thykka> or maybe the framework has "table tr { ... }" and you only have "tr { ... }" in which case the framework always
[14:09:14] <thykka> wins
[14:10:25] <amoe> thykka: I applied a special class to the tr, so my rule is more like 'tr.fixme { display: table-row; }'.  Inspector shows the display value from my CSS file being applied

[15:02:19] <msfninja_mob> well, i don't know what particularly you're trying to achieve, but you can make the submenus appear below the main element by setting z-index to a negative value om the `nav ul ul` selector. beware that main's background is transparent, so they'll still be visible behind the text. just set a non-transparent background on main in that case
[15:04:04] <msfninja_mob> https://jsfiddle.net/5a8o3j4u/
[15:17:18] <gitesh> msfninja_mob: thanks got it
[15:17:46] <gitesh> I was not trying to achieve anything i wanted to see why nav ul ul is overlabpping main

[15:19:40] <hassoon> ah that overlap thing
[15:19:50] <hassoon> well.. yw
[15:20:52] <msfninja_mob> i think css makes relative, absolute and fixed positioned elements appear above statically positioned ones
[15:21:05] <msfninja_mob> well not css, the browser

[16:21:13] <hassoon> hellow1204: what do you want to do ? remove the border surrounding the buttons ?
[16:23:15] <hellow1204> that's okay I figured it out
[16:23:30] <hassoon> well you posted a question again anyway
[16:23:52] <hellow1204> I used *:focus {    outline: none !important;}
[16:24:27] <hellow1204> one more question, how do I change the colour of the button temporarily when clicked?
[16:25:27] <hassoon> hellow1204: button:active
[16:26:07] <hassoon> hellow1204: you don't need a !important for outline:none
[16:26:14] <hassoon> it works fine without it
[16:26:39] <hassoon> hellow1204: the border you are seeing is the UA border, not the outline
[16:26:54] <hellow1204> ahh okay no worries thanks
[16:27:20] <hellow1204> do I place button:active inside button { } ?

[16:39:17] <hassoon> hellow1204: using the :focus is a better approach https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/434 , but it also includes focusing on the button using the tab key
