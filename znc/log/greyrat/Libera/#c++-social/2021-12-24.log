[01:55:13] <ERROH> i've read today how pegasus imessage hack worked on some level
[01:56:33] <Renderwww> is that the one where getting a sms is enough to get haxxored?
[01:56:40] <ERROH> yeah
[01:56:51] <ERROH> can't find that, suspisious
[01:57:02] <ERROH> it involved building a virtual architecture
[01:57:19] <Renderwww> apple should do something against it, those pegasus guys a circumventing the app store fees!
[01:57:50] <ERROH> a buffer overflow in jbig2 implementation they used (which they needed for pdfs) allowed for xor and shit
[01:58:08] *** Joins: LunarJetman (~LunarJetm@user/zogatribe)
[01:58:13] <Faux> riir
[01:58:23] <ERROH> so they built a virtual arch that could run their code and break out of jail
[01:58:25] <LunarJetman> isn't it tho?
[01:59:38] <Faux> Was reading the Apache Arrow implementation today; it's all unsafe / cast garbage, like the C++ impl, and they are doing an arrow2 using actual programming. Neither is well documented.
[02:00:04] <ERROH> https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html
[02:00:21] <ERROH> i've only read like the second half
[02:00:37] <ERROH> what's an arrow
[02:00:40] <Faux> It's a relatively reasonable project to use unsafe in if you hate yourself.
[02:01:02] <Faux> Arrow is their big data containers / simd project.
[02:01:23] <ERROH> eww
[02:06:08] <Faux> It's essentially "how should you lay out data in memory", c.f. numpy data frames.
[02:06:36] <Renderwww> kek, those people write tens of thousands of lines of code just to use arrays
[02:06:42] <Renderwww> enterprise software!
[02:11:08] <Faux> Yup.
[02:11:14] <Faux> Webscale arrays.
[02:12:47] <Faux> One of the overlooked aspects of enterprise, make everything worse on purpose so there's some chance of interoperability or vendor swapping.

[02:33:51] <ERROH> when i was still team red i kept trying it every couple months before i realised they don't really care about my model
