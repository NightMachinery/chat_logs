[00:08:45] <DarthGandalf> JohnComputation: probably most of them are here now
[00:09:25] <JohnComputation> Hopefully. I'm gradually attempting a rejoin of most, if not all of them
[00:09:34] <JohnComputation> the news is quite saddening, yes
[00:09:40] <JohnComputation> but yeah
[00:10:15] <JohnComputation> also switched to a socat configuration as noted out in the Wiki, because proxychains is also no longer for me
[00:10:32] <JohnComputation> no longer working
[00:10:52] <JohnComputation> well, I need to test, but I lost connection to everything for some reason 
[00:11:22] <JohnComputation> probably not going to test, because socat works nicely
[00:12:13] <JohnComputation> well, just for the sake of helping out, I will at some point
[00:12:46] <JohnComputation> make sure it wasn't a fluke
[00:13:12] <JohnComputation> encountered that a while ago
[00:14:29] <JohnComputation> was using proxychains3... the devs for proxychains-ng still haven't fixed that background process issue, last time I checked
[00:27:58] <Nothing4You> autoop is not working when you have a large number of channels due to rate limiting, as it will receive "unchallenged" responses with the note that it could be caused by lag. is there any workaround besides increasing the timeout and compiling the module myself?
[00:40:54] *** Joins: mg55 (mcg@user/mg55)
[00:58:42] <DarthGandalf> Yes, use services
[00:58:43] <DarthGandalf> :)
[00:58:51] <DarthGandalf> ChanServ, etc
[01:00:21] <DarthGandalf> if each bot is only on one channel, it will be simpler for them to not time out
[01:00:31] <DarthGandalf> So you can set up a number of bots
[01:00:41] <DarthGandalf> As opposed to do everything from a single connection
[01:01:40] <Nothing4You> i actually use it for non-bot connections
[01:02:14] <Nothing4You> but i guess since freenode is now essentially officially closed it doesn't matter anymore
[01:03:44] <DarthGandalf> No, I meant use bots to manage channels, if ChanServ is not available
[01:03:52] <DarthGandalf> If it's Efnet
[01:04:20] <DarthGandalf> But if the question was about freenode, my advice it to just leave it
[01:04:23] <Nothing4You> i didn't want to register on "new freenode"
[01:04:35] <DarthGandalf> s/it/is/
[01:04:35] <ZNC-Linker> DarthGandalf meant: “But if the question was about freenode, my advice is to just leave it”
[01:04:36] <Nothing4You> but i didn't get around to migrate all stuff yet
[01:04:55] <Nothing4You> now i'm effectively locked out so it's dead anyways
[01:05:04] <Nothing4You> even more than before
[01:05:30] <Riccardone> how can I set *sasl module ?
[01:05:37] <Nothing4You> services do make things easier tho
[01:05:46] <Nothing4You> Riccardone: do you mean load?
[01:06:15] <DarthGandalf> [[sasl]]
[01:06:15] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/sasl
[01:08:33] <Riccardone> Nothing4You: I've alreay loaded *sasl module, but something wrong because sometimes it tells me that "RequireAuth fails"
[01:09:18] <Riccardone> Nothing4You: so i'm obligated to set "RequireAuth no", identify myself with NickServ, and then "REequireAuth yes"
[01:10:26] <Nothing4You> Riccardone: then something in your sasl config is incorrect as sasl auth is failing
[01:10:48] <Nothing4You> did you verify that the network supports sasl? which auth type are you using, user+pw or cert?
[01:11:29] <Riccardone> "SERVER /password"
[01:12:28] <Riccardone> Nothing4You: the *sasl module has the Mechanism EXTERNAL
[01:12:57] <Nothing4You> external is for use with [[cert]]
[01:12:57] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/cert
[01:13:03] <Nothing4You> not user+pw auth
[01:13:17] <Nothing4You> for user+pw auth you need plain mode i believe
[01:14:47] <MetaNova> by default *sasl tries both EXTERNAL and then PLAIN
[01:15:27] <MetaNova> if you specifically told it to only try EXTERNAL and it's failing, then, there's an issue with *cert and/or the destination network not having the correct fingerprint on file
[01:16:02] <Riccardone> MetaNova: so i've to generate again the certificate ?
[01:16:20] <MetaNova> that depends on what you're trying to accomplish
[01:16:53] <MetaNova> are you just trying to get SASL auth working or are you specifically trying to do SASL EXTERNAL?
[01:17:28] <Riccardone> MetaNova: i'dlike to connect to znc with cert method
[01:17:41] <MetaNova> what does '/msg *cert info' say?
[01:17:53] <MetaNova> wait
[01:17:56] <MetaNova> connect TO znc?
[01:18:30] <Riccardone> MetaNova: yes, to connect to znc
[01:18:46] <MetaNova> then you need neither *sasl nor *cert
[01:18:50] <MetaNova> you need [[Certauth]]
[01:18:50] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Certauth
[01:19:08] <MetaNova> and the login method in your client does not change - Server Password is still required
[01:19:14] <Riccardone> MetaNova: You have a certificate in: /home/R/Riccardone/.znc/users/Riccardone/networks/Libera/moddata/cert/user.pem
[01:20:13] <Nothing4You> MetaNova: not entirely - you don't need /the/ password, just anything set there
[01:20:17] <Nothing4You> > From now on you can log in to ZNC with any password but it cannot be blank. E.g. you can just send an "user@identifier/network:" as the server password. 
[01:20:19] <Riccardone> MetaNova: CertAuth module is loaded (within WebAdmin)
[01:20:38] <Nothing4You> Riccardone: /msg *certauth list
[01:20:41] <MetaNova> okay, what happens when you do '/msg *certauth add'?
[01:21:16] <Riccardone> <*certauth> No keys set for your user
[01:21:44] <Riccardone> <*certauth> You did not supply a public key or connect with one.
[01:22:12] <MetaNova> you need to create a client certificate, reconnect to ZNC while your client is using it, then add the fingerprint to *certauth
[01:22:28] <Nothing4You> the client cert already exists
[01:22:32] <Nothing4You> it was imported to *cert
[01:22:41] <MetaNova> cert and certauth are not related
[01:22:58] <Nothing4You> except it's not needed in *cert unless you also want to use it for auth from znc to the irc server
[01:22:59] <Nothing4You> yeah
[01:23:31] <Nothing4You> i just meant that a cert already exists

[03:26:15] <tuvok> this is what i make
[03:26:22] <tuvok> when i compile a new version
[03:26:50] <sheep> what is the path to the znc binary that you're using?
[03:27:41] <MetaNova> I bet they're just calling 'znc' and it's calling the still-installed packaged version
[03:27:53] <MetaNova> tuvok: what happens when you call /home/bnc/znc/bin/znc ?
[03:28:08] <MetaNova> (or whatever the actual full binary path is)
[03:28:39] <tuvok> ähm /home/bnc/znc/lib/znc/sasl.so <- sorry i have post not the correct path 
[03:28:52] <tuvok> this /home/tuvok/znc/lib/znc/sasl.so
[03:28:55] <tuvok> moment
[03:28:57] <tuvok> i will test it
[03:29:54] <tuvok> than will this message show [ !! ] ZNC is already running on this config.
[03:30:14] <MetaNova> that means ZNC is already running, and using that config
[03:30:36] <tuvok> Opening config [/home/tuvok/.znc/configs/znc.conf]...
[03:30:39] <tuvok> this is the config path
[03:30:50] <MetaNova> so
[03:30:52] <sheep> what is the current PID of the ZNC process? check 'readlink /proc/<PID>/exe' when you know the PID, and thatr should give you the path to the znc binary that it used
[03:31:01] <MetaNova> ZNC is already running
[03:32:42] <tuvok> sheep 27914 is the pid
[03:32:52] <tuvok> but readlink /proc/27914
[03:32:54] <tuvok> will not run?
[03:33:02] <sheep> readlink /proc/27914/exe
[03:33:09] <tuvok> ah
[03:33:24] <tuvok> this is the link /home/tuvok/znc/bin/znc (deleted)
[03:33:50] <sheep> is that the right path?
[03:33:54] <tuvok> yes
[03:34:00] <tuvok> its version 1.7.1 i think i will compile a new
[03:34:08] <sheep> and that's the prefix yuou used with ./configure?
[03:34:26] <tuvok> wget https://znc.in/releases/znc-1.8.2.tar.gz;tar -xzvf znc-1.8.2.tar.gz;cd znc-1.8.2;./configure --prefix=/home/$USER/znc/;make;make install;cd ..
[03:34:28] <tuvok> this is what i make
[03:34:30] <tuvok> in one line
[03:34:40] <tuvok> but also for the older version

[17:37:56] <DarthGandalf> nackjicholson: libera password should go to [[sasl]] instead
[17:37:56] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/sasl
[17:39:48] <DarthGandalf> Khaytsus: what do you mean?
[17:40:18] <MetaNova> I am also unfamiliar with what "snake mittens" means
[17:40:28] <MetaNova> I know "snake oil" but I don't think that's related
[17:41:32] <MetaNova> ah, urbandictionary has "snake mittens: an ill-conceived idea which is spectacularly useless"
[17:42:10] <MetaNova> Khaytsus: if I have multiple devices in my house and I want each to share the same nick(s)/network(s), there's nothing wring with using ZNC as a local multiplexer
[17:45:17] <Khaytsus> MetaNova: Yep there are certainly use cases, experimenting or using mulitple clients..  and there's potentially complexity and cost involved but I still think running znc inside the lan is like using a F1 race car to do the grocery runs.
[17:45:37] <MetaNova> so what you're saying is
[17:45:43] <Khaytsus> And yes, snakes don't have hands :P
[17:45:47] <MetaNova> it's "impractical" but "incredibly fun" :P
[17:46:26] <Khaytsus> If I absolutely couldn't or didn't want to run a znc outside the lan I'd likely have one inside too, to be fair
[17:46:41] <Khaytsus> Since I use about 3 or 4 clients, just depends on the situation
[17:47:06] <DarthGandalf> It all depends on what you want ZNC for
[17:47:37] <DarthGandalf> Some use cases require running it outside, some require running it inside, for some it doesn't matter

[19:45:55] <Wammy_> Hey there - hoping I can get some assistance getting znc setup here. I am using the container version - went through making a config - I've adjusted settings via webadmin, and have configured SASL, generated a certificate and assigned the fingerprint to my nickserv account. 
[19:46:26] <Wammy_> I cannot get it to connect, using --debug I can see it is trying to authenticate, the last command I see is ZNC -> IRC [AUTHENTICATE+] (queued)
[19:46:36] <Wammy_> sits there until the connection resets and then it tries again
[19:48:43] <Khaytsus> Be more specific; ZNC can't connect to IRC networks or your client can't connect to ZNC
[19:49:07] <Wammy_> ZNC to network
[19:49:12] <Wammy_> client to ZNC works
[19:50:07] <Wammy_> I was having the same issue on sasl plain (instead of external using the certificate)
[19:50:36] <Wammy_> it would hang on ZNC -> IRC [ AUTHENTICATE PLAIN {hash} ] (queued)
[19:52:00] <Khaytsus> The container has networking that works I assume right?  try to exec into it and ping out or something maybe?
[19:52:24] <Wammy_> yes the container has networking
[19:52:25] <MetaNova> I think I remember someone saying containers need to be told which ports they can access externally

[19:57:51] <MetaNova> did you specify the user and password in *sasl?
[19:57:51] <Wammy_> thats got ot be related. 
[19:58:09] <Wammy_> yep
[19:58:46] <Khaytsus> Curious, have you tried a normal client from the same location the docker container is running on?  Some networks/vpn/etc are blocked by libera unless using a cert
[19:58:51] <Wammy_> yes

[20:10:15] <MetaNova> interesting
[20:10:30] <Wammy_> can't join channels or pm
[20:11:04] <MetaNova> you said you generated a certiuficate, were you trying to do SASL EXTERNAL?

[20:11:12] <Wammy_> yes
[20:11:27] <MetaNova> well, set MECHANISM to EXTERNAL PLAIN
[20:11:32] <MetaNova> or EXTERNAL
[20:11:40] <Wammy_> yes I had tried that, same result
[20:11:46] <MetaNova> and this is assuming you loaded/configured cert correctly
[20:11:56] <MetaNova> what is the output of '/msg *cert info'?
[20:11:58] <Wammy_> did it per the instructions on the website
[20:12:16] <Wammy_> You have a certificate in /znc-data/users/wammy/networks/Libera/moddata/cert/user.pem
[20:12:39] <MetaNova> what is the output of '/msg nickserv cert add'? (no additional arguments)
[20:13:35] <Wammy_>  insuffiient parameters
[20:13:44] <MetaNova> then the cert was not supplied
[20:13:51] <MetaNova> how did you generate the cert?
[20:13:58] <MetaNova> check file permissions?
[20:14:06] <Wammy_>  .msg nickserv cert list lists the cert fingerprint
[20:14:07] <MetaNova> /ownership
[20:14:31] <Wammy_> used this: https://libera.chat/guides/sasl and this https://libera.chat/guides/certfp
[20:14:39] <Wammy_> got the fingerprint as it is specified in those links
[20:15:01] <Wammy_> and copied/pasted the contents of the generated pem file into the webadmin under the Certificate configuration
[20:15:01] <MetaNova> Wammy_: `ns cert list` doesn't matter when libera does not see you as having connected with a client certificate
[20:15:14] <Wammy_> MetaNova, well if I disabled SASL I did not
[20:16:06] <MetaNova> SASL auth is independent of a client certificate being offered/accepted
[20:16:28] <Wammy_> Ok
[20:16:34] <MetaNova> if you /whois yourself you should see, "Has client certificate fingerprint <fingerprint>"
[20:16:54] <Wammy_> the connection from ZNC -> IRC gets authenticated to nickserv, if sasl is disabled then it did it via the cert module
[20:16:55] <MetaNova> and if you are connected with a cert, '/msg nickserv cert add' adds the currently-seen fingerprint
[20:17:07] <Wammy_> I cant send any commands to IRC from ZNC
[20:17:15] <Wammy_> in fact, even PONG replies are failing
[20:17:20] <Wammy_> connection keeps resetting due to ping timeout
[20:17:23] <MetaNova> if it says insufficient parameters it means you are not connected with a certificate ..
[20:17:34] <Wammy_> I understand
[20:18:37] <MetaNova> I would re-generate the cert, and this time follow [[Cert]]
