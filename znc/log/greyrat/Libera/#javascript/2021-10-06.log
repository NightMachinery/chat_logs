[02:52:08] <ljharb> `fetch`, not Fetch
[02:52:11] <ljharb> also `response`.

[02:52:29] <ljharb> CoJaBo_: yes, there's lots of good ways
[02:52:35] <CoJaBo_> Yeh, it's probably spelled correctly in the app, as it's working
[02:53:14] <ljharb> CoJaBo_: `const response = fetch(‚Ä¶); response.json().catch(async error => { console.log(await response.text()); })` or something like that
[02:53:14] <CoJaBo_> Surely I'm not the only person to ever hit this lol; what is the best way to handle logging bad JSON?
[02:53:24] <ljharb> CoJaBo_: but, if your server has invalid json then use another server
[02:53:43] <ljharb> invalid json is exceedingly rare because to get it, you'd have to be hand-writing JSON, which is an incredibly universally known bad practice
[02:53:50] <CoJaBo_> ljharb: I need to figure out how/why it is invalid
[02:54:00] <CoJaBo_> I assume something is dumping an error message, but that's just a guess
[02:54:10] <ljharb> CoJaBo_: the `error` in the catch callback is the error message
[02:55:13] <ThePendulum> I figured the single letter it gives to point where the parse failed just wasn't quite enough

[02:58:30] <CoJaBo_> Once its read, you can't read it again, which is where my frustration lies
[02:58:40] <ljharb> CoJaBo_: that's false
[02:58:44] <ljharb> CoJaBo_: you can read it a million times
[02:58:44] <CoJaBo_> I have to read it out as text and then parse it as json, apparently
[02:59:01] <ljharb> CoJaBo_: it's a promise. promises have no limit on how their values can be extracted.

[02:59:05] <ljharb> CoJaBo_: i am quite certain.

[03:01:07] <CoJaBo_> Grossness confirmed tho.
[03:01:08] <ljharb> CoJaBo_: then yes, you have to extract the text first and then parse it manually

[03:02:05] <ThePendulum> I'm not sure it's stupid that you can't read it twice, I think the body data might still actually be on the server?

[03:02:46] <ljharb> CoJaBo_: lol

[03:03:07] <spynxic> ljharb: could it be reduced into an array
[03:03:43] <ljharb> CoJaBo_: right, so you can open it and reload the page
[03:03:52] <ljharb> spynxic: yes, but first let's see if `.forEach` is provided directly on headers instances.
[03:03:56] <ThePendulum> I do wish chrome had a way to start tracking activity in the dev tools before it's opened, maybe it does
[03:04:05] <CoJaBo_> ljharb: It's an intermittent error

[07:11:12] <Rockwood> really i just back after afk
[07:11:15] <Rockwood> okay
[07:11:27] <chovy> i'm just trolling ljharb
[07:11:33] <Rockwood> is it any kind of framework?
[07:11:47] <chovy> think node without all the garbage and typescript
[07:12:08] <Rockwood> ah okay
[07:12:33] <Rockwood> why typescript is too much famous?
[07:12:41] <Rockwood> is it backend too?

[07:13:40] <chovy> ya
[07:14:04] <Rockwood> so TS replaced Node?

[07:14:22] <chovy> ignore ljharb he'sa a hater
[07:14:31] <Rockwood> i am confuse now
[07:14:49] <Rockwood> who is correct and who is trolls?
[07:14:58] <chovy> of course i'm correct
[07:15:12] <chovy> ljharb is grumpy old node guy
[07:15:22] <chovy> like old perl mongers
[07:15:45] <Rockwood> i used PHP as backend
[07:16:20] <Rockwood> another question, what should do for IOS and android?
[07:16:34] <hexology> i'm in a nodejs project where the source code is under `src/` and there is a package.json file alongside src/. i ran the `node` repl, but it said "module_not_found" when i tried to require() something inside the project. is there a way to set that up?
[07:16:35] <chovy> Rockwood: svelte-native
[07:16:59] <hexology> and/or is there some 3rd party repl that the cool kids use?
[07:17:17] <hexology> the project uses yarn instead of npm if that's relevant at all
[07:17:38] <chovy> i was goiong to help you until you said yarn i don't support facebook
[07:17:53] <Rockwood> chovy, am right https://svelte-native.technology/tutorial?
[07:17:53] <hexology> i don't know any better :)
[07:18:03] <hexology> but it looks like the answer is `yarn node`
[07:18:18] <chovy> hexology: yarn install probably then `yarn start`
[07:18:39] <hexology> i just want to open a repl to explore some things interactively, i don't want to run the server
[07:18:49] <chovy> hexology: node
[07:18:54] <Rockwood> could be React  fail after FB server down?
[07:19:07] <chovy> react is facebook garbage
[07:19:29] <Rockwood> but its famous also
[07:19:51] <chovy> charles manson is famous too
[07:20:15] <Rockwood> i think simply its a JS framework
[07:20:31] <Rockwood> and JS never outdated

[08:31:42] <tusko>   history = document.querySelectorAll("#history-list > a")
[08:31:42] <tusko>   console.log(history[0])
[08:31:54] <tusko> for example
[08:33:36] <tusko> is that the wrong way to index this thing?
[08:34:33] <hexology> ljharb: what is PnP?
[08:34:51] <tusko> party and play, duh
[08:46:09] <ljharb> hexology: a yarn feature that breaks node's module resoution
[08:46:24] <hexology> hm, how would i know
[08:46:25] <ljharb> tusko: that should work fine. what's `history.length`?
[08:46:34] <ljharb> hexology: maybe something in yarnrc?
[08:48:18] <hexology> we don't appear to have one in this project
[08:48:55] <tusko> history.length was like 42
[08:49:50] <tusko> but console.log(history[1]) says undefined or worse
[08:51:22] <ljharb> hexology: maybe it's a block in package.json
[08:52:17] <hexology> well i was wrong, it just doesn't find them at all, even with `yarn node`
[08:52:23] <hexology> it seems like they aren't in node_modules at all
[08:52:25] <ljharb> hexology: then they're not installed
[08:52:34] <ljharb> hexology: did you skip the install step? you have to run `npm install` or `yarn install` first
[08:52:38] <ljharb> hexology: on any node project
[08:52:41] <hexology> i did `yarn install`
[08:52:55] <tusko> console.log(history) definitely gives me an object it says [history%20object]
[08:52:56] <hexology> let me see how this is actually run
[08:52:58] <thykka> is it possible to convert a string into a number, which - when used as a sorting "index", would end up sorted by code point?
[08:53:26] <ljharb> thykka: huh?
[08:53:30] <hexology> i have this in package.json  --  `"dev": "npx cross-env NODE_ENV=developmemt nodemon -e js,graphql src/index.js"`
[08:53:34] <thykka> i thought about converting each character to it's codepoint, but then anything with just one more character would get a very big number
[08:53:36] <ljharb> thykka: what do you mean when used as a sorting index
[08:53:40] <ljharb> hexology: ok so `yarn dev`
[08:53:54] <ljharb> thykka: what is your actual use case? why would you ever want to sort by code point
[08:54:03] <hexology> ljharb: i'm not trying to run the server, i want to open a node repl and be able to import and use the modules in the project
[08:54:04] <thykka> ljharb, my database has a sorting column that only accepts integers
[08:54:06] <ljharb> tusko: that console log doesn't make sense
[08:54:14] <thykka> ljharb, but the API i'm consuming is providing a string
[08:54:19] <ljharb> hexology: ok well then node_modules needs to be there
[08:54:31] <ljharb> thykka: ok so then your database needs to be changed
[08:54:33] <thykka> sometimes the string is a number, sometimes something less sensical, like 'z' and 'zz'
[08:54:33] <hexology> i do have node_modules. all the 3rd party deps are there
[08:54:43] <ljharb> thykka: you don't want to be hacking around an insufficient data model
[08:54:51] <ljharb> hexology: ok, so then `node` should open a repl in which they're requireable
[08:54:55] <thykka> changing the db is not an option here
[08:54:56] <ljharb> hexology: what are you trying to require that's not working?
[08:55:03] <ljharb> thykka: then sorting based on a string really isn't either
[08:55:04] <tusko> ljharb, my script is very simple https://pastebin.com/eW9QEiBA

[08:55:15] <hexology> thykka: why would it be one big number? i don't know how js strings are represented, but at least _conceptually_ the string should be a sequence of numbers

[08:55:44] <tusko> Yes, but it doesn't for some odd reason
[08:55:48] <ljharb> hexology: yes, it's wrong
[08:55:55] <ljharb> hexology: if it's inside src then you need `./src/a/b/c`
[08:55:55] <thykka> ljharb, okay, if it's unsolvable otherwise, that's good enough for me.
[08:56:02] <thykka> thanks
[08:56:03] <tusko> if that console.log were console.log(history[1]) it doesn't work
[08:56:05] <ljharb> tusko: make a jsfiddle or a codesandbox then
[08:56:14] <ljharb> tusko: that reproduces it
[08:56:22] <ljharb> hexology: `.` is the current directory in node
[08:56:39] <hexology> ljharb: aha, i need both '.' and 'src'
[08:56:46] <hexology> i didn't realize those were literally file paths
[08:56:46] <ljharb> yes
[08:56:48] <ljharb> yes
[08:56:51] <ljharb> everything is literally file paths
[08:56:54] <tusko> wtf is a jsfiddle
[08:56:54] <hexology> noted
[08:57:06] <ljharb> anything that doesn't start with `.` is a "bare specifier", and that starts loading from node_modules
[08:57:11] <tusko> javascript sucks

[08:57:32] <shan> https://github.com/VPanjeta/ModiScript/tree/master/website ok so i'm poking around in this source code, and I can't seem to figure out where the classes like d-flex etc are coming from. Is that a vue thing? The class names feel similar to Bootstrap, but i can't find that anywhere in the source, either.
[08:57:49] <ljharb> thykka: you can do that but unless you left-pad everything with zeroes, you'll get weird conflicts
[08:57:50] <tusko> I wouldn't call it skill
[08:57:54] <ljharb> tusko: and yet
[08:58:03] <thykka> hmm
[08:58:04] <tusko> C is a much better language

[08:58:10] * ljharb pats head
[08:58:12] <ljharb> ok then
[08:58:47] <hexology> thykka: does javascript allow you to sort by some collection or sequence? instead of concatenating them into a string
[08:58:48] <ljharb> thykka: but also this is going to make for very very large numbers
[08:58:54] <ljharb> hexology: JS does but their DB doesn't
[08:59:10] <hexology> it sounds like their db only supports numbers
[08:59:16] <ljharb> tusko: anyways if you want free expert help, make a jsfiddle and i'll solve it for you

[09:00:33] <hexology> that's quite a mess the db admin has made then
[09:00:53] <ljharb> lol yep
[09:01:13] <hexology> this isn't a one-time thing? like you need some arbitrary string->integer function such that order is preserved?
[09:01:41] <thykka> ljharb, zero-padding would indeed seem to work. But then I'd first need to determine the longest string in the bunch... so yeah, would seem like they'd end up at least 42 digits long D:
[09:02:00] <thykka> i'll just raise a flag about this with the people providing the API
[09:02:05] <hexology> if you only need to do this as a one-off, you can probably strip these down to their shortest unambiguous prefixes
[09:02:15] <ljharb> thykka: what kind of data is this tho
[09:02:19] <ljharb> thykka: and what's the "sort" for
[09:02:20] <thykka> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[09:02:25] <thykka> ah
[09:02:50] <thykka> these are contacts. i assume the sorting is for the display order in listings
[09:03:12] <thykka> but seeing the data is what it is, i'd be guessing implementation details anyway..
[09:03:17] <ljharb> ok - and the API provides that sort order?
[09:03:27] <ljharb> if it doesn't, then it clearly doesn't matter, right? so you can just shove it on the end
[09:03:55] <ljharb> and if there's an algorithm to apply, like "alphabetical" or something, then why would you need a sort index in the first place
[09:04:03] <thykka> yeah, it provides strings with alphanumeric content. I'm guessing their side has an input box where there should be a number input...

[09:09:00] <ljharb> tusko: ok so it looks like you have script tags in the HTML which is weird
[09:09:14] <ljharb> tusko: all JS should only be in a .js file, never inline in an HTML page
[09:09:30] <tusko> I know, right? BUt actually those are just 'searches' I did that are in the results page
[09:09:40] <tusko> here, I can do better than this give me one sec
[09:09:44] <ljharb> tusko: ok so the real issue is that "history" is a special name in browsers
[09:09:49] <ljharb> tusko: pick literally any other variable name
[09:09:58] <ljharb> tusko: like "hist" or something
[09:10:14] <ljharb> `history` is `window.history` which is the browser's browsing history.
[09:10:43] <ljharb> and don't forget to declare every variable with `var`, `let`, or `const`.
[09:11:47] <tusko> ljharb, https://jsfiddle.net/hc5uev2o/

[09:14:23] <tusko> oh
[09:14:32] <tusko> that's strange
[09:14:54] <ljharb> you just got lucky and named the variable the one thing that won't work
[09:15:08] <tusko> So, let's say that I wanted to test if hist[i].text matches a certain pattern
[09:15:28] <ljharb> what pattern
[09:15:33] <tusko> like if it starts with <script> I want to exclude it and go forward to the next item until I find one that doesn't begin with <script>
[09:15:41] <ljharb> ok that is a very different thing
[09:15:48] <ljharb> you can not parse HTML without an HTML parser

[09:18:00] <ljharb> that free book might help
[09:18:12] <tusko> I'm pretty experienced as a programmer. I doubt it would be too tough to get up to speed with javascript again
[09:18:21] <tusko> its been years since I wrote it

[09:19:11] <tusko> its a different language now

[09:19:42] <ljharb> it is vastly different
[09:19:48] <Intelo> ljharb I guess this is not a good time to talk about the inheritence. When it would be for you?

[09:24:38] <Intelo> ljharb I am using knex. simply. And just reusing some queries that are mostly used. It floats my boat

[09:27:08] <ljharb> Intelo: no, i'm still not sure sure
[09:27:27] <ljharb> tusko: JS has no i/o, so the answer is "your question is flawed from the start, ask a better question"

[15:30:14] <prussian> maybe you can use it to find bugs I guess.

[15:32:09] <DnzAtWrk> That is silly

[18:09:36] <joepie91> honestly, for anybody else who feels like there's no way out: please talk to a friend, or if you feel like there's nobody you can consider a friend (you'd definitely not be the first to feel like that), talk to whoever you are closest to - even if it feels like you barely know them... chances are you'll find them happy to listen to you and talk with you, and they may well end up being a closer friend than you expected. I'll skip the
[18:09:36] <joepie91> usual "it'll get better" platitudes that you've probably heard a hundred times before, but even when things suck, it's certainly much easier to get through it and build up a better life when you have friends to do it with.

I talked to him for a bit about it but figured he'd be okay. 2 weeks later he shot himself.
[18:52:46] <gamara> if only friends were more like parent scoped variables in closure

[18:53:32] <stenno> merpnderp: its difficult if you have two different group of friends but those groups don't like each other
[18:53:55] <stenno> so the one group will shout at you for hanging out with the other one and vice versa

[19:57:24] <Intelo> efdee ljharb if you observe one thing (one thing for this one example, though there can be many others), the table name does not needs to be written every time. As the model already has it. The findOne or findWhatever etc (more reusable functions) don't need to be imported. So these small things to make things resuable might not work with simple
[19:57:25] <Intelo> functions (unless prototypicaly inherited).

[19:58:53] <Intelo> The reason I am asking is that besides the fascilities of this approach, I also agree with ljharb and efdee. And prefer composition IF inheritence is needed

[19:59:07] <Intelo> Rockwood sleep well
[19:59:07] <Rockwood> true people
[19:59:16] <Rockwood> yeah i will do
[19:59:47] <Rockwood> Intelo, every one hates me every where :d
[19:59:55] <Intelo> no me.
[20:00:05] <Rockwood> lol
[20:00:11] <Intelo> :)
[20:00:45] <Rockwood> i am not talking about non English people
[20:00:48] <ljharb> Intelo: even if you "need" inheritance, you should still minimize the parts that use it
[20:00:59] <ljharb> Intelo: the table name SHOULD be written every time. explicitness is a feature.
[20:01:12] <ljharb> Intelo: same with imports versus "functions are magically available"
[20:01:16] <Rockwood> Intelo, i have point why do you wanna like this?
[20:01:27] <Intelo> it is minimized. I do the shared quries like findonebyid and table/col names via models
[20:01:29] <Intelo> thats all
[20:02:24] <Intelo> ljharb well why would you say it should be written. It will make one param more on each line (though it could be just not mentioend)

[20:10:09] <Intelo> well "UserMode" will speak that the table name would be of user model. The thing here is that if dev types the tablename, he would have to use more brain cells.  + go to some models (or user mode), search its name there OR do import tablename from UserFile. Then user tablename.   Thats ok and fine. Just more time and brain consuming. Not a big
[20:10:09] <Intelo> thing. But I got your idea.

[20:14:32] <prussian> If you think it makes sense to inherit from some base DAO class, do it. #yolo.
[20:14:57] <stenno> hexology: you should consider key-value pairs to be unsorted

[23:18:26] <KDev> perfect, it worked btw, thank you! I'm basically just trying to add padded 0's for an intToHex function, so if I do intToHex('09A', 6) it will pad 3 zero's to the left

[23:52:40] <goldmund> codebam, The Apollo blog has a pretty decent checklist https://www.apollographql.com/blog/graphql/security/why-you-should-disable-graphql-introspection-in-production/
[23:53:06] <codebam> oh I'll check that out thanks
[23:53:11] <codebam> I meant in staging though, not prod
[23:53:33] <codebam> I guess all the data there is fine if it leaks anyways

[23:54:42] <codebam> but I'll be sure to disable it in production. does anyone happen to know how I would do that? can I just set each one to process.ENV.NODE_ENV?
[23:54:49] <codebam> or I mean
[23:55:04] <codebam> process.env.NODE_ENV === 'staging'
[23:55:17] <codebam> or I guess 'development'
[23:55:24] <codebam> not sure what the standard is for that
[23:56:21] <goldmund> The standard with most build tools e.g. webpack is to set NODE_ENV to "development" any time you are serving locally with a dev server / HMR and "production" any time you run an actual build...which means you probably need to override it manually
[23:56:32] *** Quits: mei (~mei@user/mei) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:56:48] <goldmund> for example, at my job we have dev, qa, po, and prod envs - NODE_ENv by default is always "production" for all of them (using Webpack 5 and Vite)
[23:57:01] <goldmund> This tends to trip some of our newer devs up
[23:57:10] *** Joins: mei (~mei@user/mei)
[23:57:43] <goldmund> Assuming you have a CI pipeline, you would want to set it there
