[02:12:26] <geirha> depends. Normally, you only get the exit status of the last command in the pipeline, which is what you want when the last command is a grep
[02:13:42] <geirha> you can enable the pipefail option to have the pipeline return non-zero if any commands in the pipeline returns non-zero. Make sure you disable it again afterwards.  set -o pipefail; unzip ... | gzip ... || die ...; set +o pipefail
[02:13:51] <yaymukund> What's the best way to declare an array for use only within a function. I'd like to call the function multiple times and start with an empty array each time. I tried doing `declare -a foo` but that appears to be global.
[02:13:59] <earnestly> I'd just not use a pipe
[02:14:21] <earnestly> yaymukund: local
[02:14:22] <geirha> !pf euo > ted-ious, see this for why not to enable pipefail for the entire script
[02:14:22] <greybot> ted-ious, see this for why not to enable pipefail for the entire script: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#pf60 -- Don't do this! -- set -euo pipefail
[02:14:38] <ted-ious> Well I have to or else I end up writing a huge file and having to delete it immediately.
[02:14:59] <earnestly> That's okay
[02:15:04] <geirha> declare -a foo will also make it local if you do it inside the function
[02:15:19] <geirha> though -a is unnecessary
[02:16:12] <earnestly> ted-ious: In bash you can use pipestatus
[02:16:39] <earnestly> And use if statements instead of misuing logic constructs like || or &&
[02:17:17] <ted-ious> Are || and && considered bad or maybe not portable?
[02:17:48] <earnestly> Or, case ${PIPESTATUS[0]}-${PIPESTATUS[1]} in 1-1) both unzip and gzip failed ;; 1-*) unzip failed ;; *-1) gzip failed ;; *-*) both succeeded; esac

[02:21:40] <earnestly> pipelines are good for when the data is something that can be flowed through it like a sieve such that invalid inputs are obviated while only the valid flows through
[02:22:08] <earnestly> When your pipeline is essentially a sequence of conditions then it's better to be more proceedural/imperative
[02:23:09] <earnestly> Think of it like: if ! unzip then ...; fi | gzip -c ... what would that error condition send to gzip so that gzip knows something went wrong?  It becomes a weird thing to reason about
[02:23:41] <earnestly> Fortunately for these rare cases where you want to avoid reading large stuff twice bash's PIPESTATUS can be used to check after the fact

[03:34:07] <phy1729> If you want to follow posix, you have simple commands (a builtin, function, or external binary). A pipeline is a sequence of simple commands joined by |. An AND-OR list is a sequence of pipelines joined by && or ||. And a list is a sequence of AND-OR lists separated/terminated by ; or & (or newline).

[03:40:12] <phy1729> so echo hello world is all by itself a list
[03:40:28] <kurahaupo> rtn0: in your pipeline are 3 commands. The last one is a compound command that has more commands inside it
[03:41:12] <rtn0> so the number of commands is always equal to the number of pipes, plus one?
[03:41:29] <kurahaupo> rtn0: the grammar is recursive
[03:41:48] <rtn0> a | b | c | d | echo $suchnsuch
[03:42:02] <rtn0> the above would be 5 commands
[03:42:04] <kurahaupo> A pipeline has one fewer | symbols than it has subcommands
[03:42:07] <rtn0> seperated by 4 pipes
[03:42:15] <rtn0> kurahaupo: yes, that
[03:42:57] <kurahaupo> That's implied by the grammar; like a fence has one more post that it has panels
[03:43:41] <kurahaupo> You can't put a spare | at the start or end of a pipeline, if that's what you're asking
[03:43:47] <rtn0> so just to make sure that im using the terminology correctly -- proper linuxisms...: the filesizecomparison Pipeline is a *pipeline*, containing 3 commands?
[03:44:01] <kurahaupo> yes

[03:44:29] <kurahaupo> s/contains/is/
[03:44:45] <rtn0> ahhh, yes
[03:44:51] <rtn0> and the 3rd command is a while loop
[03:44:58] <kurahaupo> rtn0: yes.
[03:45:02] <rtn0> so basically, the 3rd command is the "while" command
[03:45:33] <rtn0> and the "while" command has 3 parts to its form:   conditional; do condition; done
[03:45:43] <rtn0> and the "while" command has 3 parts to its form:   conditional; do statement*; done
[03:45:48] <kurahaupo> It's the whole loop; if you say "while command" people might think you're referring to just the keyword "while"
[03:46:09] <phy1729> rtn0: while <list>; do <list>; done
[03:46:17] <phy1729> # help while

[03:46:24] <kurahaupo> rtn0: it's more general: while COMMANDS ;  do COMMANDS ; done
[03:46:33] <rtn0> okay.
[03:46:35] *** Joins: Gamma (~Gamma@zsh/user/Gamma)
[03:46:42] <rtn0> makes sense.
[03:46:48] <phy1729> where COMMANDS is what POSIX calls a list
[03:47:04] <kurahaupo> the condition is the exit status of the last command before the "do"
[03:47:32] *** Joins: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha)
[03:47:56] <kurahaupo> so you can write « while printf 'prompt> ' ; read input ; do something with "$input"; done »
[03:48:36] <rtn0> so just ot make sure i understood you, kurahaupo, if the last command in the list of commands before the first ; symbol returns (1), then it goes to the "; done" portion?
[03:48:52] <rtn0> otherwise, it continuously does whatever is between the first and second ; symbols
[03:48:54] <kurahaupo> phy1729: Note that compound commands themselves do have an exit status
[03:49:12] <kurahaupo> yes, it exits the loop
[03:49:20] <kurahaupo> if the condition fails
[03:50:41] <kurahaupo> Another common idiom is the equivalent of do-while in other languages « while dostuff ; test here ; do :; done » where the ":" command does nothing
[03:50:58] <rtn0> the condition fails if the exit status of the very last command before "; do" returns 0. got it.
[03:51:05] <rtn0> oops
[03:51:10] <rtn0> the condition fails if the exit status of the very last command before "; do" returns 1*. got it.
[03:51:38] <kurahaupo> Any non-zero is "failure"
[03:51:39] <tirnanog> returns > 0
[03:51:47] <kurahaupo> 1-255 specifically
[03:51:54] <rtn0> the condition succeeds (and keeps looping, doing the "do statement"'s contents) if the exit status of the very last command before "; do" returns 0. 
[03:52:04] <kurahaupo> correct
[03:52:10] <rtn0> okay thanks
[03:52:22] <rtn0> returns > 0 is fail. got it.
[03:52:29] <phy1729> kurahaupo: indeed, even function definition has an exit status
[03:52:34] <rtn0> can it return less than 0? is that even possible?
[03:52:39] <kurahaupo> It's very gratifying to see light bulbs go on in other people's heads
[03:52:47] <kurahaupo> no, strictly 0-255
[03:53:07] <kurahaupo> That's a kernel limit, not a shell limit

[04:24:15] <rtn0> and the kernel system calls are actually functions of the kernel binary itself? y/n/m? and they are written in C? y/n/m?
[04:25:13] <phy1729> system calls are how you get the kernel to do stuff yes; the language they are written in depends on your kernel
[04:25:18] <tirnanog> yes and usually, respectively.

[04:25:44] <rtn0> okay... that almost answers everything...
[04:25:57] <rtn0> but why the need for the "wrapper functions"?
[04:26:12] <kurahaupo> rtn0: The Linux kernel is mostly written in C; and syscalls behave as if they were function calls, except that the compiler needs to generate different code to call them. Within the kernel yes they're typically implemented as separate functions, behind some special despatch code
[04:26:38] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[04:26:51] <kurahaupo> The wrapper functions can be called just like ordinary functions, without the compiler needing to know how to invoke system calls
[04:27:18] <tirnanog> compatibility, portability, being able to transparently use new kernel features as and when appropriate.
[04:28:00] <rtn0> so the usefulness of the wrapper functions is that they can be used from the shell?
[04:28:18] <kurahaupo> In a few cases, the wrapper functions re-arrange the parameters. When stat64 was introduced, the stat function in libc was adjusted to call it if it was available, instead of the old stat syscall
[04:28:33] <kurahaupo> no, they can be called from normal C code
[04:28:38] <tirnanog> they can't be used from the shell. they are used by the shell.

[07:26:34] <autopsy> 234 MB times 10 would be 2,340 MB 2 GB so that times 3 will fill mostly all the memory in 8 GB system.

[15:42:46] <geirha> autopsy: still a big guess. Could be a mounted external drive that is not part of the OS, or inside a homedir
[15:42:54] <autopsy> exec is shorthand english for execute.
[15:42:55] <tirnanog> autopsy: fair enough, but we don't know what "file" is at this juncture.
[15:43:09] <autopsy> Yes true so I could be wrong.

[15:43:39] <Soliton> it was also specifically included in the quotes.

[15:46:32] <Soliton> do you see the error message above?
[15:46:39] <twkm> because as Soliton showed ''exec VAR=value program'' doesn't work unless DEBUG=1 is actually a program that can be invoked with "program" as its argument.
[15:47:03] <rendar> what about `unset DEBUG; exec program` ?
[15:47:14] <Soliton> what about it?

[15:47:42] <rendar> oh, ok right
[15:47:56] <geirha> rendar: ah, so you were not actually running exec DEBUG=1 program  you exported DEBUG at an earlier point and are just running exec program?

[15:50:41] <rendar> If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the -u option.
[15:50:49] <rendar> the docs says this
[15:50:54] <rendar> "If this is set to a non-empty string"

[15:51:19] <Soliton> thus the opposite would presumably be unset or set to an empty string.
[15:51:20] <geirha> then unset PYTHONUNBUFFERED and PYTHONUNBUFFERED= will be considered the same

[15:51:31] <rendar> right

[15:51:56] <mot1> tirnanog: It was a folder I had a bunch of pdfs in
[15:52:00] <tirnanog> mot1: so you probably wanted to treat directories and files distinctly, such that directories have the 'x' bit enabled. for example: find stuffdir -type d -exec chmod 755 {} + && find stuffdir -type f -exec chmod 644 {} +

[21:14:50] <FreeBDSM> hi all. Is there a quick solution for this task: I need to capture all dirs in the current one (no recursion) excluding just a few. So `dirs=(*/)` captures all dirs into an array, but how to quickly remove some values (matching against some substring)?

[21:47:54] <Maxattax> how do I move AND rename a directory with mv? usage is not obvious to me, instead of renaming the folder it inserts it into a parent
[21:48:46] <greycat> mv /oldname /new/name
[21:48:51] <Soliton> are you trying to overwrite an existing dir?
[21:49:10] <Maxattax> `mv "${OVERLAYROOT}/usr/bats/Apps/WebTemplater/Templates/"* "${OVERLAYROOT}/usr/bats/www/templates/"` does what I want, but it requires a `mkdir -p "${OVERLAYROOT}/usr/bats/www/templates/"`
[21:49:15] <koollman_> Maxattax: mv oldpath/oldname newpath/newname
[21:49:34] <koollman_> and, yes, you can't move to a path that does not exist yet
[21:49:40] <greycat> that * at the end of the first argument tells me you're not trying to "move and rename a directory"
[21:50:04] <koollman_> Maxattax: what about: mv ${OVERLAYROOT}/usr/bats/Apps/WebTemplater/Templates ${OVERLAYROOT}/usr/bats/www/templates
[21:50:18] <Maxattax> this is what I'd like to do: `mv "${OVERLAYROOT}/usr/bats/Apps/WebTemplater/Templates" "${OVERLAYROOT}/usr/bats/www/templates"`
[21:50:37] <Soliton> so do that and make sure the www dir is there.
[21:50:53] <Maxattax> but it fails because /usr/bats/www/templates "does not exist" (I am trying to rename Templates to templates so in my mind this should work)

[21:51:33] <koollman_> Maxattax: not for that exact command, at least
[21:51:43] <greycat> do not mkdir -p ../templates
[21:51:47] <koollman_> Maxattax: don't have a / at the end of the destination

[21:54:09] <greycat> You CANNOT do this in a "one-liner" with standard POSIX utilities.  Unless your one line has both mkdir and mv in it.
[21:54:10] <Soliton> there is no single command that creates the parent dir.
[21:54:34] <Maxattax> but my parent dir is being moved and renamed, is that not valid?
[21:54:41] <greycat> *sigh*
[21:55:04] <Soliton> does the www dir exist?
[21:55:11] <Maxattax> yes, www exists
[21:55:18] <Soliton> then it already works.
[21:55:28] <Maxattax> but it doesn't work T_T

[23:46:49] <queso> After upgrading to a newer version of Debian, the behavior of ctrl-w has changed.  Previously the text one_two would have been deleted with a single ctrl-w, but now it takes three of them.  Is there a key-combination that invokes the previous behavior?  Both are useful.
