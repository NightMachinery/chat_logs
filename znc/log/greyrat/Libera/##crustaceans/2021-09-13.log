[00:04:29] <Brekkjern> Finally!
[00:06:22] <riv> i realized today
[00:06:31] <pja> Brekkjern: well done :)
[00:06:34] <riv> if you want encrypted chat, it's better to use IRC with a plugin
[00:06:41] <riv> than e.g. matrix or some other thing
[00:06:52] <riv> the server doesn't need to know or care about encryption at all
[00:06:59] <pja> riv: I don't think that will obscure metadata, but I guess you could do it over tor?
[00:07:00] <Brekkjern> pja: Now I only have to write the pseudocode, do the big-o analysis and do the 3 other tasks :P
[00:07:08] <riv> metadata?
[00:07:36] <pja> Brekkjern: Well, it's 2 deques & a tiny bit of bookkeeping, so the big O analysis should be a mostly a copy+paste.
[00:07:48] <Brekkjern> Kinda, yeah
[00:08:04] <pja> I look forward to more algorithm related WTFery from you in the future :)
[00:10:20] <Brekkjern> I bet there will be more :S

[15:59:40] <prussian> sign me up
[16:00:17] <Brekkjern> AFAIK it's impossible to sign away your copyright to something. It's inherently the creators right.
[16:00:28] <Brekkjern> What you can do is give license for unlimited use
[16:00:39] <Brekkjern> Which is essentially what NFTs are trying to be
[16:01:08] <gerikson> kinda sorta maybe
[16:01:29] <gerikson> this is a decent overview https://reason.com/2021/03/30/are-nfts-dumb-a-scam-or-secretly-useful/
[16:01:30] <buttsbot> Are NFTs Dumb, a Scam, or Secretly Useful? – Reason.com
[16:01:45] <gerikson> ``In a lot of cases, the NFT you just shelled out good money for might end up merely "proving" that you own a broken link. NFTs need to point to something. Usually, this is in the form of a URL that leads to a JSON metadata file. If whoever is hosting the URL goes out of business or just decides not to host that file anymore, well, tough luck.''
[16:01:54] <prussian> I ain't no legal man, but isn't the point of a Copyright assignment contract to literally transfer/sign away your copyright to another?
[16:02:28] <prussian> I imagine most places with contract law and copyright have some kind of framework for this.
[16:02:48] <Brekkjern> Might be. I am not a lawyer :P
[16:03:05] <Brekkjern> Also, laws vary by region, so...
[16:03:09] <gerikson> me neither
[16:05:21] <Brekkjern> In Norway there isn't really a "copyright" but more of a "creators right"
[16:06:18] <Brekkjern> It's impossible to sign away that you created something. It's inherent in the work. But you can sign over licenses to do things with that work.
[16:09:15] <gerikson> tbh haven't studied the Swedish legislation
[16:10:44] <Brekkjern> Me neither, but it came up when volunteering for The Gathering
[16:22:14] <edk> Brekkjern: i feel like that's the same most places, you're just calling it something different
[16:22:29] <Brekkjern> Kinda is, kinda isn't
[16:23:07] <edk> we have a "moral right" to say you created something you created, and you can't give that up, though it's difficult to enforce if you didn't claim to have created it at the time

The organization, a 3rd party not-for-profit corporation in Spain called "Fundación PostgreSQL," did not give any indication to the PostgreSQL Core Team or PGCAC that they
[21:55:09] <manicennui> would file these applications.
[21:55:12] <manicennui> What a bunch of fucking assholes.
[21:56:36] <manicennui> When presented with an additional cease and desist and the updated terms in which the PostgreSQL Core Team and PGCAC would be willing to settle, Mr. Hernández Tortosa indicated that he would only drop the trademark filings under his terms, which include the weakening of the PGCAC and the potential for outside entities to control the PostgreSQL trademarks.
[21:57:03] <Brekkjern> Can he please go fuck himself?
[21:58:02] <manicennui> "Welcome to Fundación PostgreSQL! Our goal it to promote the Open Source software known as PostgreSQL at the national and international scope, with a special emphasis on the Spanish-speaking community."

[22:05:35] <manicennui> Email is still the best decentralized communication system that exists.
[22:06:11] <manicennui> Funny that you mention early 2000s, since that is when "forums" were popular too.
[22:06:43] <Brekkjern> That was my point...

[22:53:20] <prussian> the
[22:54:56] <ngoldbaum> wasn’t eskimo mitming people’s converations on the ios app he sold?
[22:55:41] <prussian> That's what some claim. I can ask him to share me the code I guess. I know he punted it to a friend to be ported to Android, but it stalled out. He doesn't seem to care about the app
[22:55:53] <prussian> and ya, he makes the IglooIRC app
[22:56:38] <prussian> idr the details of the contraversy. He is scummy, for many a reasons, but I doubt he went that far.
[22:57:29] <ngoldbaum> i saw logs at some point where he was threatening to spread someone’s nudes
[22:57:40] <ngoldbaum> that he got from mitming a conversation
[22:57:57] <ngoldbaum> blackmail is certainly scummy
[23:02:41] <prussian> ya something like that.

[23:25:02] <indigo> > Nobody is writing news articles about people who drive their Teslas without any issues. I’ve had my model 3 for over 2 years, not a single issue, no oil changes, no maintenance done on it whatsoever. 25k miles.
[23:25:05] <indigo> Lol, HN
[23:29:00] <gerikson> most boring blog ever
[23:29:12] <gerikson> "Day #456 with my car: no issues"
[23:29:37] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: tbh I'm growing more and more disillusioned with TR
[23:29:57] <gerikson> and Dr. Roy was all aboard the Lee train because Lee was pro-RMS
[23:30:05] <gerikson> or rather anti-anti-RMS
[23:30:27] <gerikson> then they screwed over the FSF and he had to admit he was wrong
[23:30:31] <ngoldbaum> the chud-o-sphere
[23:34:55] <dimadima> boring car blog is a good car blog, in some ways

[23:36:49] <gerikson> cars are commodities, excellence (well, free-of-problemness) is assumed to be the default
[23:37:20] <gerikson> no-one mentions "it's been 3 years since I had any sort of bad interaction with my bank/insurance company/utility"
[23:37:33] <gerikson> them working flawlessly is normal
[23:37:41] <gerikson> you only complain when there's something wrong
[23:40:47] <gerikson> I kinda like these reminders we aren't all robots on this site https://lobste.rs/s/8fzzmz/what_are_you_doing_this_week#c_lx84sc

[23:47:02] <manicennui> They aren't a robot because they have problems other than technological ones, or because they express real emotions?
[23:50:51] <gerikson> por que no los dos?
[23:51:13] <gerikson> "my wife left with my best friend, and I sure do miss him"
[23:51:57] <indigo> gerikson: I just think it's funny that in an article about a battery replacement (which is something that every Tesla owner will need to do once the car hits a certain age/mileage if they still have the car), the commenter is talking about how their two year old car has no problems whatsoever
[23:52:06] <gerikson> hah
[23:52:20] <indigo> My Corolla also had no problems at two years old :P
[23:52:43] <bkero> A Corolla isn't even broken in yet at 2 years.
[23:52:58] <bkero> Give it another decade an 150k miles, then it'll start to be broken in.

[23:58:40] <manicennui> Jesus. There are a lot of anime series with over 1000 episodes.
[23:58:50] <gerikson> one of these things are not like the others
[23:59:18] <manicennui> Which band?
