[02:04:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> dv^_^: Most people don't like resizing their windows
[02:04:36] <adiabatic> dv^_^: sensible widths for text only top out at about 60–80 characters
[02:04:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> ^
[02:04:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I wouldn't say quite that few, but not too far off)
[02:05:38] <adiabatic> like, if I go to danluu.com I usually have to _shrink_ the window to get a sensible column width
[02:06:15] <gwern> luu is very special and enjoys the retro hacker esthetic because it saves him 1 or 2 lines of css
[02:06:31] <dv^_^> that's the point though. you can trivially resize the window to make it smaller, but you can't resize it to make the content wider
[02:06:45] <adiabatic> you are the second American I know who spells "aesthetic" like that
[02:07:54] <adiabatic> also the nice thing about what luu does is if he has a ginormous table, he doesn't have to tear his hair out trying to find a way to have most text be kept to 70ch, but images and bigass tables to however big they need to be
[02:08:02] <gwern> I believe it should be spelled either 'esthetic' or 'æsthetic'. people who spell it 'aesthetic' are cowards! *intend your dipthongs, coward!*
[02:08:08] <adiabatic> and he HAS had ginormous tables

[02:11:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Window resizing is only convenient and trivial if you don't use tabs
[02:11:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I use tabs, tabs are good
[02:11:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Thus your argument is wrong
[02:11:42] <adiabatic> tabs are kind of a cope
[02:11:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> no

[03:18:30] <saturn2> is it ok to become a supervillain because molnupiravir costs $700 a dose and you can't afford it?
[03:19:01] <quanticle> Only if you make your supervillain name "Hammer Breaker" or something along those lines
[03:19:13] <saturn2> oh ok
[03:19:22] <kuudes> basicly the point is that the law says they have to act to prevent generally dangeours infectious disease (specific legal list, covid is on it) spread, and that they have taken specific decisions such as limiting testing on vaccinated or children or banning informing parents on if there has been covid recently on other children at school etc
[03:20:04] <kuudes> because the strategy was changed in around august, and restrictions were specifically ceased
[03:20:40] <kuudes> and now the 0-10 years olds have something like >700 /100k-14d incidence
[03:21:13] <kuudes> and everyplace is breaking previous records on cases, hospital patients, icu patients etc
[03:21:43] <kuudes> and some hospitals have had to move to restrict electable treatments to make room for covid, and to transfer patients to other cities etc
[03:23:00] <kuudes> previously it was that businesses challenged the restriction decisions in administrative court, but if there is a decision to not to act, that is not challengable in administrative court but instead you need to file a notice for possible crime to police to investigate if it needs to be criminally prosecuted
[03:23:38] <kuudes> it is rather deontological, I guess
[03:24:38] <kuudes> could have caused changes though, maybe, now that there is some amount of threat that as a singular headmaster or doctor or city official you would personally be brought to criminal court for indirect manslaughters
[03:25:36] <kuudes> at least some local officials have shut up on twitter, but I don't know how the suits are going on behind the scenes
[03:28:36] <kuudes> I guess there are some past cases similar to this - for instance an chief of engineering of a city and his underling got sentenced to half a year of prison in probation because in a school a pupil died to a malfunctioning liftable splitter of a gym, where the user of the lift could not supervise the area under the splitter, and this had been notified in the acceptance inspection of the building that it should be fixed before use, and had not been fixed in 
[03:28:37] <kuudes> 5 years
[03:29:59] <kuudes> personally I used such to get a construction company to fix some light fixtures which were made out of bad plastic and dropped from the ceiling; I referred to the relevant cases and reminded that personally the people receiving the email are now liable for the indirect manslaughters or assaults if someone dies or gets maimed.
[03:30:04] <kuudes> then they fixed those
[03:30:36] <kuudes> ie the company might have to pay something, but you as the manager would get behind bars possibly as a person.

[14:00:27] <quanticle> That's really strange, but, at the same time, I don't know anything about training ML models, so you're probably better off talking to someone like gwern, shawwwn or nshepperd

[17:06:42] <PapuaHardyNet> we have one python package that used to work great for it - guildai - however the people I worked with did not use it, and now I have to deduce variable values such as batch size used based on logs (obviously this is my fault since I didn't log enough)
[17:07:07] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, guildai's latest packages don't work due to an upstream dependency changing their API
[17:08:35] <PapuaHardyNet> since the functioning of guildai is not really specific to python, I'm sure I could write a golang reimplementation that has less dependencies, is more stable, and suckless (and therefore easier to learn and use)
[17:09:52] <PapuaHardyNet> the main reason I say golang is (1) more stable API and dependencies, and (2) single binary

[19:33:24] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Jokes aside, Rakuten embraced early something that many ecosystems will in the coming years: payments makes existing franchises stronger. Their core loop is getting someone onto their payment rails as a convenience to use the core business, capturing their payments business outside of their own ecosystem (which is margin accretive), rewarding their users with points for
[19:33:24] <feepbot> that business, and making those points most useful within their own ecosystem than they are outside of it. This brings the users back and encourages them to move more of their business to Rakuten’s (many, many) product lines versus their competitors. This isn’t dissimilar to the reason why every bank wants payment rails: it keeps you with the bank, earns the bank revenue even
[19:33:24] <feepbot> when you’re not transacting directly with the bank, and will bring you back to the bank’s product lines in the future. Increasingly, the same logic will apply to non-bank firms which have broad user bases. It may even eventually apply to large user bases centralized around something which is not traditionally described as a firm. (A potentially interesting fintech interview

It is emphatically not true. “There is no dog sleeping in Madonna’s former bedroom,” said a person with direct knowledge of the deal. “This is a totally made up story. The broker is talking nonsense. There is no dog. There never was a dog. The owner thought it would be a fun way to score a reality TV show. That’s it,” the source
[21:28:24] <feepbot> said. What is true: Assouline and her husband Ethan are listing the waterfront home for $31.75 million. But their client, the real owner, is not a dog. He’s a wealthy — albeit eccentric — 65-year-old Italian entrepreneur from Tuscany named Maurizio Mian...When confronted by The Post with the lie Mian said, “It’s complicated.”...“A dog doesn’t own the house,”
[21:28:24] <feepbot> admitted Mian, “but there is a foundation [for the care of the dog.]” He went on to confess that, “The dog belonged to someone else.” Legal experts confirmed that in the United States it is impossible to leave property to a pet — although money can be set aside in trust for their care...The Gunther hoax had already been called out way back in 2005, when Mian’s shell
[21:28:29] <feepbot> company Gunther Corp. paid $7.5 million for the home. “Mian once admitted to an Italian newspaper that the countess never existed,” the Tampa Bay Times reported https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2000/07/14/mystery-group-buys-madonna-s-miami-home/ . The truth, our source says, is that the owner, Mian, “borrowed” or “rented” the dog and that, “The whole story is one big
[21:28:29] <feepbot> lie.” “The fake story goes back 20 years,” they said, “Maurizio wanted to get into the film business and made up this fake story. He is the son of a billionaire. The caretaker told me the whole story, too. It is the biggest scam. It is a joke. I would like someone to put an end to to this nonsense. Right now, they have hired a dog and are filming him at the house. They
[21:28:29] <feepbot> hired a dog 20 years ago and now they’ve hired another — it is a scam.” It’s the doghouse for these publicity-starved storytellers. ' https://nypost.com/2021/11/18/a-dog-isnt-really-selling-madonnas-former-florida-mansion/

[22:51:42] <shawwwn> so for the past three weeks I've been trying to get groq's C2C links working. what are C2C links? they're basically the corpus collosum. colossum. colowhatever. They're like the wires in a TPU pod that let two different cores talk to each other. No C2C links, and it's like having 4 independent tpus. useful, but not as useful as high speed links
[22:52:35] <shawwwn> challenge #1 was even locating a box that had these magical links at all. turns out, it's easy to get boxes with groq chips. but groq chips with C2C links? no one knew where to find them. no one even had interacted with them on my team, till me.
[22:52:58] <shawwwn> so API lead refers me to Guru, the one magical person who knows All The Things
[22:53:05] <quanticle> I guess it doesn't have to be liquid for it to be in a jug: https://www.homedepot.com/p/Snow-Joe-Melt-10-lb-Jug-Premium-Environmentally-Friendly-Blend-Ice-Melter-with-CMA-MELT10EB-J/205668839

[22:53:33] <shawwwn> he says ok, let's ask in #labrats, and they'll set you up on a box with c2c links
[22:53:45] <shawwwn> so we ask. and wait.. and wait.. and a full day goes by...
[22:53:53] * quanticle has a jug like that in his garage
[22:54:12] <shawwwn> finally I promise him that I won't break anything, and could I please just use one of the ones on the spreadsheet
[22:54:17] <quanticle> C2C links?
[22:54:21] <shawwwn> he says ok
[22:54:33] <gwern> shawwwn: how did no one in groq not need or want to use chip interconnects? were they just training tiny models in data-parallel fashion or just accepting the pessimization?
[22:54:58] <quanticle> Oh, never mind, you explained above.
[22:55:01] <shawwwn> so I ssh in, and crack my knuckles. finally! c2c links
[22:55:11] <shawwwn> except... no... now the fun begins
[22:55:17] <shawwwn> acquiring the c2c links was only step 1
[22:55:25] <shawwwn> *using* the c2c links requires Voodoo
[22:55:33] <shawwwn> or more specifically, Guru
[22:55:55] <gwern> Voodoo is decades out of date, you know that
[22:56:41] <shawwwn> so I try running the multichip example, and it dies. Guru points out that it's dying because this particular box has 8 chips, divided into two groups, A and B -- so e.g. /dev/groqB0, /dev/groqB1, /dev/groq{A,B}{0,1,2,3}
[22:56:54] <shawwwn> except ... for unknown reasons, /dev/groqA0 just ... didn't exist
[22:57:00] <shawwwn> maybe the hardware died. who knows
[22:57:12] <shawwwn> so I switch to group B. C2C, finally! here we goooo
[22:57:16] <shawwwn> no
[22:57:30] <shawwwn> it dies with "unable to bring up C2C links"
[22:57:49] <shawwwn> so after spending an hour or so figuring out how to enable debug logging -- always good -- I see that it's dying with "HAC out of phase"
[22:58:03] <shawwwn> what a HAC is, I have no idea, and I don't think I'll ever know
[22:58:33] <shawwwn> all I knew was that it was less tolerant than <edgy joke elided>
[22:59:04] <shawwwn> so I go to Guru and explain the problem, and he says ah! there are new changes in head to fix this issue. People are using precalculated HAC values, you see
[22:59:11] <shawwwn> and the changes in head calculate them automatically
[22:59:22] *** Joins: CryptoDavid (uid14990@uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[22:59:32] <shawwwn> great! ... except, I remind you, I ssh'ed into this box. So riddle me this: How do you get the changes from head, onto the box?
[22:59:39] <shawwwn> yes -- that sure was fun
[22:59:55] <shawwwn> so I spent the next three days or so learning the devops side of groqops
[23:00:41] <shawwwn> until finally, I had the changes in head, on the box, but using `python setup.py develop` (e.g. so I can make changes to the code -- if you pip install a package, it's really hard to make changes interactively, because it's installed. python setup.py develop just leaves the code wherever you put it)
[23:00:53] <shawwwn> so I can has C2C links now
[23:00:55] <shawwwn> no
[23:01:00] <shawwwn> HAC still out of phase
[23:01:36] <quanticle> I swear, the deeper I get into your machine learning stories, the less sure I am that reading something real versus some made-up Star Trek fanfic. "Captain! The C2C links are failing, and the Guru system is unable to diagnose the error." "What do you suggest, Lieutenant Laforge?" "I don't know, it seems like a problem with the HAC phasing, but to fix that would require a full disassembly and
[23:01:38] <quanticle> overhaul of the warp cores."
[23:01:40] <shawwwn> at this point, I've been bugging Guru off and on for almost three weeks about this problem, and I'm starting to feel like either I should be forcing Guru to solve this problem, or I am incompetent and am wasting Guru's time
[23:01:51] <shawwwn> so I err on the latter, and think really hard about how to solve it myself
[23:02:06] <shawwwn> I reason: okay, HAC is out of phase. That means a log message is printing an error somewhere
[23:02:16] <shawwwn> I'm going to find that error, and comment it out
[23:02:45] <quanticle> Well, at least finding what's printing the error will give you some idea as to why the error is being printed, right?
[23:02:48] <shawwwn> so I found the error, and it turned out that the HAC tolerance was set to 10 and 30 respectively. The error said HAC out of phase: 37
[23:03:01] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[23:03:08] <shawwwn> so in my Biggest Brain Moment, I change the hac tolerances to 50 and 50 respectively
[23:03:23] <shawwwn> presto. everything works. the multichip example worked flawlessly the first try.
[23:04:00] <two2thehead> "Distractor suppression refers to the ability to filter out distracting and task-irrelevant information. Distractor suppression is essential for survival and considered a key aspect of selective attention. Despite the recent and rapidly evolving literature on distractor suppression, we still know little about how distracting information is suppressed. What limits progress is that we lack mutually agreed upon principles of how to study distractor 
[23:04:00] <two2thehead> suppression."
[23:04:02] <shawwwn> so that's the story of how I spent 3 weeks trying to get C2C links working, and ended up getting them working by basically commenting out the error check
[23:04:20] <shawwwn> I don't think there's a moral. at least I hope not.
[23:04:31] <quanticle> "I've solved the problem, Captain." "What was the issue, Mister Laforge?" "The HAC phase tolerance was set to 10 and 30. I've retuned the phasing to be 50 50. Our warp cores are now fully operational."
[23:04:50] <shawwwn> RIGHT? emily literally said "what is this, star trek?"
[23:04:55] <shawwwn> and I fully agree
[23:04:56] <gwern> does this story end with the 8-chip cluster burning out in a month?

[23:41:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bah
[23:41:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Guess I'll re-ignore feepbot for now, until feep responds -_-

[23:42:35] <two2thehead> gwern, lies! Emperor Xi does NOT make mistakes
[23:42:39] <two2thehead> Everyone else is wrong

[23:43:03] <gwern> two2thehead: of course emperor xi is not at fault. it's the markets being irrational and capitalist and subverting the china dream
[23:43:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Almost two weeks with no reply from Pinboard support
[23:43:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Motherfucker is still tweeting
[23:44:00] <shawwwn> I.. what? https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1462073230932549634?s=21
[23:44:08] <saturn2> maybe pinboard support is never going to reply
[23:44:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Surely that can't be true
[23:44:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> He wouldn't just take money and not provide the promised service
[23:44:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> That would be wrong!
[23:44:40] <shawwwn> maybe pinboard’s only support is maciej
[23:44:42] <gwern> maciej is so noble and virtuous. he must be advised by poor customer support
[23:45:34] <shawwwn> It was a one time $20 payment (for people who signed up over a decade ago) and is like $20/yr. Hard to be mad at that kind of value
[23:45:56] <shawwwn> Offering Obormot a whine line was probably a bad business decision
[23:46:06] <shawwwn> Support: *links api docs*
[23:46:13] <shawwwn> “It’s a json tree”
[23:46:41] <shawwwn> *magical hand motions*
[23:47:02] <shawwwn> “You use your api key”
[23:48:46] <two2thehead> huh "As Americans enthusiastically gobble up the new EV unicorns, the Chinese are busy confronting something they left behind four decades earlier: Rationing"
[23:48:48] <two2thehead> TIL
[23:52:42] <quanticle> shawwwn: Welp, no saving that cat now, it's in Narnia
[23:52:46] <two2thehead> "Traders are instead putting their money into staples, such as soy sauce maker Foshan Haitan Flavoring & Food Co., whose $78 billion market cap is now higher than Xiaomi’s"
[23:53:04] <two2thehead> I'm trying to think of a similar analogue for the US
[23:53:20] <two2thehead> 'Nestle now has a higher market cap than Google'?
