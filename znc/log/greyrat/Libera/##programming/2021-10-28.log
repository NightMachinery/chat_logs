[00:52:32] <bud> he created BSD0

[00:56:27] <dre__> I mean, for me personally, I'd want to put something open source, and then just be able to say "Dre[underscore][underscore] made this project originally, xyz just improved it in some way"
[00:57:41] <bud> yeah , i think its something one has to make up their own mind about. but i am very much in BSD license camp, i think landley is right. and i always been a "but forcing a license, is the opposite of freedom" kind of guy.
[00:58:10] <dre__> and I feel like gpl has the most firepower to kinda defend that;
[00:58:19] <dre__> freedom needs to be defended imo.
[00:59:09] <bud> i defend it by making sure i don't include any GPL libs so i can freely chose the license i want.

[01:06:12] <bud> he thought he could write a 100% bash compatible shell from scratch in much less lines of code. he had no idea how weired bash really is.
[01:06:25] <dre__> yeah bash is weird
[01:06:30] <white5moke> re-engineer bash? why?
[01:06:39] <bud> so it isn't GPL :D
[01:06:42] <dre__> I think we should make "yet another standard" 
[01:06:55] <dre__> cue xkcd comic
[01:07:06] <white5moke> oh
[01:07:23] <bud> also this is not a new shell, it is 100% bash compatible, but written from scratch.

[03:10:06] <dre> mawk, yeah it's like the average distance from the average for any point.
[03:10:16] *** Parts: nulleip_ (~luiz@189.34.167.234) ()
[03:10:22] <dre> if you look at the maths, it's / N
[03:10:54] <dre> but I would say in this case N = 3 because you do definitely have 2 points (min and max)  plus the average point is known as well. 
[03:11:15] <dre> no idea where you pulled 12 from tbh. 
[03:11:32] <dre> yjsy
[03:11:52] <dre> that's why it's the "standard(ized) deviation from the mean"

[09:09:37] <Decker> 'we want to be able to load from anywere' *stuffs it in /windows* there.
[09:10:18] <vdamewood> Yeah, the problem is Windows NT 4.0 installed to C:\WINNT

[09:14:39] <smallville7123> that does not sound right :)
[09:15:10] <vdamewood> So yeah, that "Not for NT 4.0" label was a combination of a Borland Developer hard-coding things in, and a previous owner not knowing how to fix the hard-coded path.

[22:51:09] <cq-work> I was mostly joking but... NULL only implicitly means "end of string". It's not specifically designed for that. It wouldn't make sense for a character specifically designed to mean end of string to be a valid character.
