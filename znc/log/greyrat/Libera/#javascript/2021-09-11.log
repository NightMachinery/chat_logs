[00:00:46] <AMPed> Must a child of, in my case, a span always be a string? I'm hoping to create '<span>${some_number}</span>'. Or do I need to 'parseInt' ${some_number} when I want to use it?
[00:03:15] <GreenJello> not sure what you're asking. Am I missing some context?
[00:03:26] <GreenJello> did you try that and run into an issue?
[00:04:39] <AMPed> I haven't yet. Just wondering, because I see there's such a thing as document.createTextNode, but I don't see anything like document.createNumericNode or whatnot.
[00:05:24] <GreenJello> there aren't number nodes in the DOM
[00:06:22] <GreenJello> but createTextNode probably implicitly converts numbers to strings
[00:06:40] <GreenJello> if you needed to do that explicitly, you could write String(3.14)
[00:06:45] <silly> i guess it'll always do .toString()
[00:07:27] <AMPed> Right, so if I wanted a number both to display, and to manipulate, I suspect I need to createTextNode for display and parseInt when I want to add or decrement.
[00:07:28] <silly> n> {}.toString()
[00:07:28] <jellobot> (fail) SyntaxError: Unexpected token '.'
[00:07:35] <silly> n> ({}).toString()
[00:07:36] <jellobot> (okay) '[object Object]'
[00:07:59] <silly> everybody has seen that in webpages before
[00:08:18] <GreenJello> AMPed, it's usually best to only write to the DOM, but not read from it when you don't need to
[00:08:19] <silly> n> 5..toString()
[00:08:19] <jellobot> (okay) '5'
[00:08:46] <GreenJello> AMPed, so you'd keep the number in JS, manipulate that, and write it to the DOM as a string after changing it each time
[00:09:08] <AMPed> GreenJello: just add a non-displaying attribute?
[00:09:21] <AMPed> 'data-value' or something?
[00:09:22] <ezzieyguywuf> is there a way from the command-line to recursively generate a list of all dependencies for a given module?
[00:09:38] <GreenJello> AMPed, no, just a variable or object property in your code
[00:10:10] <GreenJello> attributes are also always strings

[01:05:21] <GreenJello> this is JS, not C
[01:05:34] <AMPed> GreenJello: you get what I mean :)
[01:06:26] <shan> celphi: there's a few reasons you might want to use campfire: 1) you might have an existing vanilla js application to refactor, and having little helpers for 1) reactive data 2) element creation would make that a lot easier, without having to restructure your entire application like Svelte or Reeact would cause you to do. 3) As for building new applications, it's a lot simpler to get started
[01:06:28] <shan> with than something like React or Svelte or Angular since you don't have to learn either a) some kind of DSL (in the case of Angular) or b) some entirely new language and system of properties and stuff (React with its JSX, Svelte). I guess what Campfire competes with most closely is Alpine, though. 4) also, while i strongly recommend using a transpiler+bundler with TypeScript, campfire allows
[01:06:31] <shan> you to just import it with ESM, which makes getting started/futzing around with it for a bit really really easy (and in fact this was going to be the only distribution mechanism before i realised how miserable not having type hints was)
[01:06:40] <shan> Woops, that got a bit long.

[01:18:15] <sheetjs> systems that don't support commonjs actively go out of their way not to support it
[01:18:47] <GreenJello> ezzieyguywuf, a compromise for things you want to publish to npm is to use ESM syntax, but have babel generate common.js modules using require/module.exports
[01:19:14] <ezzieyguywuf> GreenJello: sounds like a fair compromise
[01:19:20] <GreenJello> for a CLI package it doesn't super matter, but publishing ESM code to npm will break things for anyone not using it

[03:04:49] <FlorianBad> Can someone explain why WRP doesn't happen upon click? https://jsfiddle.net/b6uya14q/4/   Since I have the eventListener as false, the click event should first happen on the child (#current) and it does, but when it doesn't propagate down to the parent which is #wrp, and I think it should...
[03:05:39] <FlorianBad> s/but when/but then/

[03:06:23] <FlorianBad> wroathe: oh.... hmm I didn't know the difference! Thanks a lot
[03:07:01] <wroathe> FlorianBad: Events in the DOM "bubble". Meaning that they are fired on the "target" (the element you interact with), and they climb from parent to parent triggering any event listeners found. Each element that has an event listener that is triggered will be the "currentTarget"
[03:07:46] <FlorianBad> otherwise the `target` is the original one?
[03:08:02] <wroathe> FlorianBad: The "target" is usually the innermost element the user interacts with

[04:47:35] <celphi> AMPed: ^
[04:47:46] <AMPed> yes, but I thought I'd be clever and make the items objects of class ShoppingItem, with constructor(name, qty) {this.name = name, this.qty = qty, this.id = Date.now()}

[04:50:43] <AMPed> The list can (it is hoped) add ShoppingItem.objects, sort them by name or qty (ascending or descending), increment or decrement their qty, and delete them.
[04:52:04] <AMPed> I wanted ShoppingItem.objects to be able to increment or decrement their own counts, and I wanted to be able to increment an existing ShoppingItem if the user enters in the name of an already-existing item.
[04:52:26] <AMPed> I think I'm getting too clever for a homework assignment.
[04:52:28] <celphi> ok so add/remove/display what else?
[04:53:01] <AMPed> That's about it. That and increment and decrement the count ("qty").
[04:53:11] <AMPed> And sort by name or qty.
[04:53:17] <celphi> yeah that's a result of adding and remove  right?

[08:55:25] <theskillwithin> unrelated, but your code editor probably has a go to line shortcut.  for me i think its ctrl + g.  and if type 300 it takes me to line 300.  if i type 300:10 it takes me to line 300 and places the cursor 10 chars in
[08:55:38] <y0shi> I'm thinking that I should find a direct reference to 'module' in 'charting_library.esm.js', preferrably around line 313. Or indirect reference in a file imported/called from this file. Is my thinking wrong here?

[09:02:35] <wroathe> The fact that pastebin shows the "raw" version of the file right below the file is so annoying for finding code
[09:03:12] <GreenJello> y0shi, actually, the problem might be that babel is running on this file, and converting the export to module.exports
[09:03:20] <matsaman> give me the raw version only every time
[09:03:25] <GreenJello> i.e. babel introduces the 'module' reference
[09:03:30] <matsaman> if I can't find line numbers on my own I can't help you anyway
[09:03:56] <GreenJello> but if webpack is expecting it to be an ES module, then it won't provide a 'module' variable
[09:03:58] <wroathe> matsaman: In general I don't pull down other people's code into my editor if I'm helping someone debug somethign over IRC
[09:04:06] <y0shi> matsaman: the link does not have line numbers on the side for you?
[09:04:12] <wroathe> matsaman: So I do like having rudimentary line numbers and syntax highlighting

[09:07:13] <wroathe> matsaman: I used to work with a developer who insisted on use vim with no syntax highlighting (really nothing at all in his .vimrc) when working on large Scala applications
[09:07:34] <wroathe> No intellisense, no syntax highlighting, nothing
[09:08:26] <GreenJello> It could be worse. It could be ed.
[09:09:30] <y0shi> GreenJello: I think you might be right
[09:10:03] <y0shi> GreenJello: how would I determine what webpack is expecting though?
[09:11:41] <GreenJello> I don't know how webpack makes the decision on how to interpret a module
[09:12:02] <y0shi> theres so many moving parts in js ecosystem. not sure i'm a fan
[09:12:42] <y0shi> how would you go about resolving this? turn off babel and see what happens?
[09:13:21] <GreenJello> probably just disabling the modules transform
[09:14:04] <GreenJello> it's `modules: false` in the env preset options, if you're using that
[09:15:01] <y0shi> in .bablerc?

[09:37:54] <y0shi> GreenJello: it suggests installing 'babel-plugin-transform-class-properties --save-dev'
[09:39:29] <GreenJello> that would be for babel 6, which you aren't likely using

[14:01:55] <victor> Hey! Requesting some feedback on a design :) I want to build an application that shows two options to two different users, and when you guess the right answer, you'll be scored depending on how quick you answer. First idea was just to measure the time from options presented until user clicked and send that over to the backend, but that's easy for the user to cheat around. Second idea was to measure the time in the backend instead, but then latency
[14:01:55] <victor> might ruin the timing. Last idea I had was to before presenting the options, do some quick syncing between client<>server to see what the latency is like, and then measure on the backend, but that's vulnerable to latency jitters/inconsistent latencies instead. Anyone have any other ideas that might work for this?
[14:02:20] <victor> ^ not really a #javascript question but a general programming one, if someone know a better channel where I can ask this, please let me know :)

[14:05:16] <victor> hah, glad someone else finds it interesting :)
[14:05:28] <theskillwithin> hell ya
[14:05:33] <theskillwithin> i have no answers tho
[14:05:45] <victor> I'm also struggling to find good search terms to find existing answers, that would help me too :)
[14:06:25] <victor> as soon as you use frontend/backend + gaming/games everything is just job ads
[14:07:13] <theskillwithin> well like in a game like counter-strike, each user is in a sense literally running the server locally,  and then its synced with the gaming server there connected to
[14:07:56] *** Joins: comatory (~ondrejsyn@93.99.127.7)
[14:08:54] <victor> theskillwithin: hmm, how "literally" you mean? Last time I looked at the Source Engine multiplayer, they have a client<>server architecture
[14:08:59] <theskillwithin> and sometimes no matter how hard you try, u really can't get that full accurate result cuz latency
[14:09:42] <victor> I think my problem is slightly different than real-time multiplayer though, my constraints are way fewer and also the timing resolution doesn't have to be thaat great
[14:10:56] <theskillwithin> if u want to be sure of hooman response time i think gotta be within 150ms
[14:11:58] <victor> it's not real-time so no "minimum latency" should be required. If the measure happens in the frontend together with the "latency gatherer" I mentioned in the last solution, the latency can be 1s for all we care
[14:12:50] *** Quits: comatory (~ondrejsyn@93.99.127.7) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[14:13:01] <theskillwithin> you said on how quick they answer
[14:14:12] <victor> theskillwithin: indeed, how quick they answer relative to when the options were presented. So if the two users have different latencies (100ms vs 1000ms for example), but answered the questions from the same time after seeing the options, they should have the same score
[14:14:47] <theskillwithin> i think a user can manipulate their latency tho
[14:14:57] <theskillwithin> technically
[14:15:20] <theskillwithin> those were really the first hacks in video games i think
[14:15:34] <victor> sure, but they wouldn't gain/lose anything by it, since the timing would remain the same no matter what latency you have...

[19:13:14] <mikrosis> An ES class extends a google maps class.
[19:13:15] <mikrosis> https://github.com/javidalpe/map-label-rotated/blob/master/rotated-label.js#L1
[19:13:22] <fakuve> So like this is working https://termbin.com/s8es  (it's got another file called script.js)
[19:13:29] <mikrosis> however - that google maps class has to be loaded asynchronously
[19:13:35] <mikrosis> which means the build will fail (ES webpack)
[19:13:41] <mikrosis> do I have to add some ES definitions?
[19:13:44] <fakuve> With only one line such as `Cookies.set("ieatwebsites", "true", { expires: 2});`
[19:13:45] <mikrosis> or some other trick? thanks

[20:16:17] <wroathe> Intelo: I know you're not asking me, but in my experience TDD requires you to have some idea of what the interface is for the thing you're trying to build, and to commit energy to writing tests for that interface, and when your assumptions about that interface don't pan out you'll have wasted time and energy on useless tests that need to be discarded. For simple tasks it may be trivial to define the
[20:16:23] <wroathe> interface and the tests, but more difficult scenarios require design-on-the-fly.  In my experience it's usually better to get a rough outline of what you want in place, and then push forward with testing.

[20:34:57] <Intelo> ljharb interesting. Why not do TDD? why make tests post development/coding?
[20:35:01] <ljharb> Intelo: ie, "i have less than 100% coverage" is only justifiable in polyfill-like use cases, otherwise there's no excuse to have less than 100%
[20:35:04] <Intelo> ljharb ok
[20:35:19] <ljharb> Intelo: because there's not actually much value from writing tests first, and it's annoying to do that
[20:35:34] <ljharb> Intelo: and because you have to see what the implementation will *be* before you can write good tests for it
[20:35:53] <Intelo> ljharb I see. but if you follow the principle to write only enough to pass, the code will be streamlined
[20:35:59] <ljharb> Intelo: and "there's only two extremes" is an absurd simplification, it's a spectrum and nobody's on the same part of it consistently.
[20:36:11] <ljharb> Intelo: then you're only making the tests pass, which isn't the same thing as building software
[20:36:42] <ljharb> Intelo: of course you should have a plan - measure twice cut once, etc - but that doesn't mean you must not write code prior to writing the tests
[20:39:25] <Intelo> ljharb I see. when do you write tests? every dayend? weekend? before delivery?
[20:39:37] <Intelo> also you don't think these would help ? https://imgur.com/El9pcdC.png
[20:41:16] <onosendi1> With REST URIs, what would be a better practice. A comment's parent ID can be null. If the parent ID is null, it's a comment. If it has a parent ID, it's a reply to a comment, where the parent ID is the ID of the comment. Which would be correct? `/api/comment/:parentId` or `/api/comment` and send the parentId in the body?
[20:43:38] <wroathe> onosendi1: Comments like that form a tree. Depending on your needs you could have an API for accessing a specific comment by path: /api/comment/:commentId, /api/comment/:commentId/:commentId, /api/comment/:commentId/:commentId/:commentId

[20:44:51] <ljharb> Intelo: the order of writing is not important.

[20:47:45] <wroathe> onosendi1: It could, but now that I think this through more there's really no reason to do that if you maintain a list of child comment ids for a comment
[20:47:52] <wroathe> onosendi1: It can just be /api/comment/:commentId
[20:48:07] <wroathe> onosendi1: Whether it's a comment on another comment, or a comment on a comment is immaterial

[20:49:15] <wroathe> onosendi1: So /api/comment/:commentId would return a comment that may or may not have child comments (and potentially also a parent comment), and then you'd access either the children or the parent through /api/comment/:commentId too

[20:50:20] <onosendi1> yeah, gotcha. Thanks.
[20:50:25] <wroathe> onosendi1: If, for some reason, you need the entire comment tree you could then just make it a query string parameter: /api/comment/:commentId?view=expanded

[21:54:04] <sept> Hi, new to Javascript. I need a permanent URL for each of two small text file that I want to edit using the browser once a day. I need a URL so that others can access the config info. Is there an easy way to go about this?

[21:54:55] <ljharb> sept: make a github repo and use github pages
[21:55:47] <sept> ljharb: So, it's a really easy API to edit and download files?
[21:57:41] <sept> Because I want to upload a text file that is generated by my Javascript code in the browser.
[21:57:55] <sept> Or replace a text file with another at the same URL
[21:58:04] <ljharb> sept: i mean, you can edit file contents in github's web UI

[21:58:49] <sept> There will be no manual editing. I want it all to be done with Javascript code automatically.
[21:59:12] <GreenJello> why would that run in the browser?
[21:59:36] <ljharb> sept: what exactly do you want to achieve
[21:59:48] <ljharb> sept: like what's actually in these text files
[22:00:11] <sept> ljharb: I need a way to exchange SDP files used to make WebRTC connections between peers.
[22:00:42] *** Joins: Snyp (~Snyp@49.207.220.4)
[22:00:47] <sept> There are only two peers.
[22:01:04] <sept> I mean, the code is just to connect the same two peers.
[22:01:07] *** Joins: nomic (~nomic@185.192.69.176)
[22:01:40] <sept> This isn't some kind of app. I'm just trying to exchange SDP files (text files) between the same two peers.
[22:02:01] <sept> And automate it in the browser.
[22:02:39] <sept> GreenJello: I don't understand. What wouldn't run in the browser?
[22:03:48] *** Joins: friend (friend@c-73-43-171-169.hsd1.ga.comcast.net)
[22:04:07] <GreenJello> people close browser tabs, put their computer to sleep, or the browser can essentially sleep individual tabs
[22:04:18] <GreenJello> so they aren't great for background/cron work
[22:04:26] <ljharb> sept: there are no "files" in the browser
[22:04:36] <ljharb> sept: and if you have a URL, then you already don't just have two peers - you have two peers and a server
[22:04:43] <ljharb> sept: so at that point why not just host it on the server
[22:05:17] <ljharb> sept: keeping text files in sync between machines is also already a solved problem - you can use rsync over ssh, or Dropbox, for example

[22:07:45] <sept> ljharb: It needs to be in the browser. So download a text file and parse it with JSON or something. Also, I do have an EC2 instance running already for the TURN server used in WebRTC. But I'm new to this. I thought it would be easier to use some JS API and free service.
[22:08:38] <sept> Also, I can't use SSH in the browser...
[22:09:02] *** Joins: silly_ (~silly@user/silly)
[22:09:43] <sept> So, that would be a problem with using EC2 I think. Unless you can replace webpage files with HTTP, and not require SSH?

[22:12:25] *** Quits: silly (~silly@user/silly) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[22:13:40] <sept> So, I'm guessing the answer is obvious then. I just don't have any experience doing this stuff, so it's not obvious to me. Should I host a webserver? Would I be able to easily replace files on a webserver?
[22:14:08] <GreenJello> you could use S3, which would be free for your intended use, but you don't want to give out keys that can upload arbitrary files out on the public internet
[22:14:47] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[22:14:56] <GreenJello> so you'd have the clients post to your server so you can verify the requests, and probably do authentication

[22:16:15] <GreenJello> and yes, you can write files with whatever server side platform you use
[22:17:18] <sept> GreenJello: I'm hoping the keys would only be valid for the webserver and not the EC2/S3 instances, correct? It would be between two family members across the country.
[22:17:47] <sept> In other words, the authentication would be webserver specific.

[22:18:55] <GreenJello> you could share a key over email or a chat program and have them copy/paste it into the website
[22:19:20] <ljharb> sept: why does it need to be in the browser?
[22:19:28] <ljharb> sept: if you're downloading or uploading a file you're already out of the browser
[22:20:07] <ljharb> sept: like why is it ok for the automation to only be in the browser, but the other steps to be manual - rather than having the automation on the commandline?
[22:20:40] <sept> ljharb: You're not out of the browser if you can do it with an HTTP webserver? Once the server is set up, I want it to be browser only.
[22:21:42] <sept> ljharb: Can't you upload text to a website using JS?
[22:21:45] <ljharb> sept: no
[22:21:49] <ljharb> sept: you can't touch the filesystem with just js
[22:21:57] <ljharb> sept: the user always has to manually select the file to upload

[22:22:44] <sept> I don't want to use files at all. Only JS strings.
[22:22:49] <ljharb> sept: a webSERVER file, sure, but that's not browser only, since literally anything can talk to your server
[22:22:55] <ljharb> sept: ok but you keep saying "text files"
[22:23:02] <ljharb> sept: and wait a sec, JS strings? like live code?
[22:23:12] <ljharb> sept: why would a user be providing code directly in the browser?
[22:23:32] <ljharb> other than, like, jsfiddle and friends, i don't know why you'd want that
[22:24:30] *** Quits: duds- (~duds-@gateway/tor-sasl/duds) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[22:24:58] <sept> ljharb: JS generates an SDP string. I want to take that string and post it to a URL (that remains the same when it's updated with a new string).
[22:25:15] <sept> The URL needs to be constant.
[22:25:35] <sept> So I need to be able to edit the text associated with the URL.
[22:26:00] <sept> I have a hard time believing this can't be done.
[22:26:04] <ljharb> sept: then yes, you need some kind of webserver that's stateful so it can receive input, and persist it for successive outputs
[22:26:22] <ljharb> sept: it can't be done only with a browser because you need persistent storage, and browsers aren't open 24/7.
[22:26:30] <ljharb> sept: (what's an SDP string?)
[22:27:02] <sept> ljharb: It's config info for WebRTC.
[22:27:37] <sept> It describes your IP and other stuff. So, for most people, that doesn't change much, unless you reset your router.
[22:27:40] <ljharb> and it's generated in one client's browser because it's info describing that client?
[22:27:41] <ljharb> gotcha
[22:27:50] <ljharb> then yes, you need some kind of logic-ful webserver
[22:28:03] <ljharb> and it'll be pretty trivial to implement both the client and server code for that.
[22:29:17] <sept> ljharb: Ok. I appreciate all the advice. What things do I need to research now? I'm guessing fetch(), POST, and what else?

[22:32:45] <codebam> for my frontend how should I be reading environment variables? process.env.API_URL doesn't work on the frontend because I guess it's reading from the browser

[23:43:52] <GreenJello> teut, maybe Grid doesn't accept a className prop
[23:43:57] <matsaman> unfortunately I probably won't
[23:44:08] <teut> everything accepts a className pop
[23:44:09] <Slade> well that makes me happy too :)
[23:44:13] <matsaman> I'll just be watching something on Netflix and every time it'll be nagging in the back of my mind
[23:44:15] <teut> thats not the problem
[23:44:18] <matsaman> =P
[23:44:26] <GreenJello> teut, not true
[23:44:54] <Slade> <html> <script>
[23:45:14] <Slade> and custom components

[23:47:01] <teut>         in another file I ve used this
[23:47:07] <teut> this worked
[23:47:32] <teut> ok , sandbox time
[23:48:18] <sheetjs> is JS date parsing locale-dependent?
[23:49:18] <GreenJello> I don't think that's specified
[23:49:28] <sheetjs> Note: Parsing of date strings with the Date constructor (and Date.parse, they are equivalent) is strongly discouraged due to browser differences and inconsistencies.
[23:49:35] <sheetjs> yeah sounds like it isn't specified
[23:50:37] <silly_> teut, did you mean className="cardsList"
[23:50:52] <teut> I can try that just a sec

[23:50:58] <codebam> how do I use runtypes to validate that an array is of a specific type?
[23:52:39] <GreenJello> it has an 'Array' export
[23:52:53] <GreenJello> not to be confused with the Array JS class
[23:53:04] <GreenJello> I would import it aliased
[23:53:17] <GreenJello> import { Array as ArrayOf } from 'runtypes'
[23:53:18] <teut> nope not appearing on it
[23:53:25] <teut> in the inspector
[23:53:41] <silly_> maybe className={"cardsList"}
[23:53:43] <silly_> weird
[23:53:49] <GreenJello> these are all the same
