[00:00:54] <__abbe__> what if my type is also being part of another type which does not have custom unmarshaler implemented how would unmarshal take place then ?
[00:00:55] <Mathisen> foobaz, yes that wored to to use go run "multiple files here"
[00:01:00] <__abbe__> e.g. https://paste.sr.ht/~abbe/5f6cae54084d6f86e903c4583cb1d97a8e3ca421
[00:02:09] <__abbe__> as right now, as I noticed that the other fields of the bindIQ struct are initialized to default values, and not what's in the XML when unmarshalling
[00:02:45] <__abbe__> if I purge my unmarshaller implementation for stanza.IQ, then it works as expected (except the validation for a certain field is missing)

[06:46:21] <blacked> What backend framework does golang uses?
[06:46:32] <blacked> i mean i can use for building backend.
[06:46:55] <seebs> i don't think that question makes any sense. go has an http package in stdlib, which works fine, some people use stuff on top of it, it's not usually very framework-ish.

[06:50:15] <blacked> confusing what should i use :/
[06:50:45] <blacked> after a long time, i've choosing golang as main thing, now againg confused what framework should i use
[06:51:05] <blacked> seebs is there official framework out there which golang supports the most out of those?
[06:51:11] *** Quits: schaeffer (~schaeffer@user/schaeffer) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[06:51:36] <seebs> (1) i know not of "golang", there is a language called "go" (2) there is no official framework, at all, because go does not usually do "frameworks".
[06:52:05] <seebs> the stdlib net/http package can be used to do a backend. it is not a framework. there are frameworks, but i don't know of anyone using them happily. i can say that one in particular is *bad*; if you really need a framework, avoid "iris".
[06:53:02] <blacked> oh ok :)

[15:42:29] <wyre> hi guys, I'm trying to build a debian package for gotify, ... but ... as you can see https://bpa.st/7R7A golang debhelper has problems to met some dependencies (which aren't actually packaged for Debian). At the beginning I thought the problem was because of the golang debhelper was setting GOPROXY=off, but as you can see I've set to its default value in the debian/rules file ... and the verbose
[15:42:32] <wyre> shows it's properly set to this default value https://bpa.st/PFIA#1L232
[15:42:48] <wyre> but I'm not sure if this will imply that `go install` will automatically download these dependencies

[16:13:19] <wyre> another thing is ... I'm not sure if I should skip the testing stage ... and if all Fails are normal (I think the debhelper is not actually building the package because tests failed)
[16:14:41] <wyre> the question is now if I actually could mix both, and use GO111MODULE but just for modules I cannot retrieve from Debian repos

[18:20:47] <mrig> Hello :)
[18:21:06] <wyre> will go install call first go build?
[18:21:33] <mrig> Does anyone think that there might be any value in using structs to setup sql queries by way of the tags on the structs, or is this really over complicating things?
[18:22:22] <mrig> cant really make up my mind where to settle my abstractions, also seems like a bit of a pain to be looking up db table names when most of the time they do map to structs.
[18:23:53] <mrig> not sure if using empty structs like this would be wise or appropriate, that is to say that one could structure a statement by supplying an array of structs.
[18:26:30] <antarus> mrig: in the past I have used go-pg (which is now https://github.com/uptrace/bun)
[18:26:46] <fizzie> wyre: I don't know if `go install` strictly speaking "calls" `go build`, but it does the same steps of compiling the named packages and accepts the same flags, so effectively yes.

[21:18:43] <piwu> How do I get the name of a variable inside another variable? https://go.dev/play/p/pPt-UyL3uEZ (see 'err:')
[21:19:38] <bpalmer> piwu: go, like most compiled languages, does not preserve information about a variable
[21:19:55] <piwu> so that's why
[21:19:58] <bpalmer> it doesn't care whether you write 'x := foo(); bar(x);' or 'y := foo(); bar(y);'
[21:20:04] <piwu> bpalmer: can I do it with types or something?
[21:20:27] <frm> what is the problem you are trying to solve? why do you need the name of a variable in another variable?
[21:20:41] <piwu> each character position uses a different mapping dictionary
[21:21:03] <bpalmer> (or, for that matter, bar(foo()) , although some other languages, like C++, might have side-effects as it affects how often things are copied, etc)

[21:22:04] <piwu> I have a dirty solution of replicating the same thing as strings https://github.com/mikroskeem/gohipku/blob/master/pkg/internal/dictionary/key.go
[21:22:33] <bpalmer> piwu: perhaps you just want to use a map[string][]string ?
[21:22:49] <bpalmer> that lets you associate a string with each []string
[21:23:09] <piwu> the downside there is that map is unordered
[21:23:11] <piwu> I could though
[21:23:40] <piwu> like instead of map[string], the string would be type stringAndPos struct { str string; pos int }

[21:29:22] <bpalmer> why can't you find it there efficiently?
[21:29:38] <piwu> for looping through it doesn't sound as fast?

[21:34:07] <piwu> doing 'get pos by string' once is fine, but if you do it 10k times, performance adds up
[21:34:56] <seebs> yeah, that feels like a thing that would probably want to be mappish. i'd probably spell that as map[string]struct{}
[21:35:08] <bpalmer> so do a sort of the slice and binary search, or a schwartzian transform and then sort and binary search, or  build a trie , if you want to stick with []string
[21:36:58] <piwu> https://go.dev/play/p/5ODLeKV-g7R
[21:37:38] <piwu> uh in the first example I missed a point

[23:34:39] <bpalmer> ikke: what happens with go build utils/*.go , if there isn't a package main?
[23:34:44] <wyre> fizzie, I guess this is valid for gotify server ... but I'll still be in a missing dependencies scenarion, won't I?

[23:35:51] <bpalmer> it's documented as checking to see if it compiles and then throwing away the output; I assume there are some combination of build flags that cause it to stay around

[23:42:06] <b0nn> hmm, I'm hazy on building .a files
[23:42:23] <b0nn> I think that that's achieved with no main

[23:47:19] <ikke> I find it hard sometimes to find usefull package names
[23:47:31] <ikke> (naming things is hard)
[23:53:48] <fizzie> I would imagine `go build <name of a non-main package>` would also still leave at least some build artifacts in $GOCACHE aka ~/.cache/go-build somewhere.
[23:53:52] <fizzie> wyre: Not quite sure what "missing dependencies" specifically meant here.
