[00:19:41] <perryprog> This is a question I've always meant to ask—it's not Raku specific in the slightest, but I'm really curious what y'all's perspectives on it might be. How do you put into practice languages that you are teaching yourself? That is, how should one "come up with" projects/tools/scripts to write in with a language they're learning?
[00:22:01] <MasterDuke> i've done rosalind http://rosalind.info/ and project euler https://projecteuler.net/ problems 
[00:22:23] <perryprog> (Ugh that reminds me, I need to work on projecteuler again)
[00:23:02] <MasterDuke> synacore and matasano challenges also
[00:24:02] <perryprog> I suppose projecteuler and similar things are definitely nice, but I've often felt like a lot of the challenges lend themselves more towards small, self-contained problems that are encapsulated in single functions. They don't tend to be something you could call a "project", if that makes sense.
[00:26:10] <MasterDuke> yep. synacore and matasano are a little better in that regard
[00:26:34] <perryprog> MasterDuke, hmm https://www.vanbeeknaturalscience.com/products/companion/synacore
[00:27:01] <MasterDuke> https://challenge.synacor.com/
[00:31:32] <perryprog> Matasano looks /super/ interesting. Does it have a website? I just found the info from this git repo, but the link it has is dead: https://github.com/mteodoro/crypto_challenge
[00:32:30] <melezhik> I had some problems with posting my latest post about mybf.io principles on HN, hopefully this attempt will be more successful - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28870006 
[00:33:54] <MasterDuke> huh. don't know, haven't looked at it in a long time
[00:34:48] <MasterDuke> https://cryptopals.com/ maybe a continuation of it?

[13:10:31] <Manifest0> I'm trying to get single keypresses from stdin. The docs have this "Using getc to get a single keypress from a terminal will only work properly if you've set the terminal to "unbuffered". "
[13:10:55] <Manifest0> but what does this mean? In bash i just do "read -n1". How can i achieve the same in Raku?
[13:13:54] <mfiano> I would assume `read` does the unbuffering itself.
[13:14:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't know but the meaning is rather clear: stdin is typically more greedy than waiting for sole characters, it has a buffer and that buffer is filled whenever you are asked for input
[13:15:17] <mfiano> There are various ways to control the chunk size in Linux
[13:15:33] <mfiano> one way is the unbuffer command from expect
[13:15:54] <Mondenkind> Manifest0: it is a pain.  You must mess with ioctls
[13:16:18] <mfiano> Another is stdbuf from coreutils
[13:16:19] <Mondenkind> I suggest looking at Term::termios
[13:16:52] <Mondenkind> Manifest0: https://github.com/krunen/term-termios
[13:17:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> is "read" bash-exclusive or a program?
[13:17:09] <mfiano> its part of bash
[13:17:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> well meh, then I'm not sure if it would work with qx
[13:17:43] * Manifest0 checking Term::termios
[13:18:49] <Manifest0> is github down? :-(
[13:19:01] <mfiano> It's just you
[13:19:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> just you, can confirm 😄
[13:20:21] <Manifest0> "No server is currently available to service your request. Sorry about that. Please try refreshing and contact us if the problem persists."

[15:23:02] <cialandro> I see a lot of raku scripts written with a shebang line to rake and a "use v6;" line. The v6 line seems redundant or am I missing something?
[15:23:28] <lizmat> Just a "use v6" is redundant nowadays
[15:23:46] <lizmat> use v6.c, use v6.d, use v6.* use v6.e.PREVIEW
[15:24:03] <lizmat> are meaningful though, as they indicate a language level version
[15:24:53] <cialandro> Got it. Thank you.

[18:30:23] <mfiano> Does the file extension of a module matter? Reading an older book before the rename that recommends .pm or .pm6

[18:31:35] <mfiano> I'm not sure what is new

[18:32:06] <mfiano> It was
[18:32:08] <mfiano> Right
[18:32:24] <Altai-man> at the very least, .pm will bring you some issues with Comma
[18:32:40] <Altai-man> for a module a recommended one is .rakumod

[18:37:41] <Altai-man> [Coke], yes, that's one possible way to proceed. I hope the solution won't be to create an examples team to delegate. :P
[18:38:48] <[Coke]> Altai-man: can you submit that branch as a PR for examples?
[18:39:18] <[Coke]> Altai-man: I assume the end result is we get nice examples somewhere, so let's update them in place for now, and if they end up in docs, fine.
[18:39:21] <Altai-man> [Coke], sure, note it's only half baked (the web bit migration needs more tinkering).
[18:39:29] <[Coke]> ah
[18:40:14] <[Coke]> it may be difficult to incorporate then. I'll see what I can do. I think I want to get the site generating again (at least once by hand), then we can pull in those bits. Thanks, looks like you did a lot of stuff already.

[18:42:03] <Altai-man> [Coke], opened one, feel free to tinker one.
[18:42:29] <[Coke]> Thanks!
[18:42:55] <[Coke]> Sorry if I'm stepping on toes. I just wanted to fix the Euler issue and then yak shaving started.
[18:43:09] <Altai-man> no-no, I know how it goes
[18:43:13] <Altai-man> it's a long story though
[18:43:35] <Altai-man> the thing is, my main concern about this repo is the website looking silly
[18:44:29] <[Coke]> Agreed, could use a facelift just on styles (but also a bunch of other stuff)
[18:44:30] <Altai-man> it's not about contents being outdated or something, it just looks very 2009 and IMO does the opposite to attracting new users. creates a negative image? maybe this fits
[18:44:56] <[Coke]> I think it's the same as an older version of docs.
[18:44:56] <Altai-man> so I wanted to completely remake it, did some work
[18:45:07] <[Coke]> Is that in this branch?
[18:45:28] <Altai-man> [Coke], we don't have a "new" version of docs, it's exactly the same design. :P
[18:45:39] <Altai-man> [Coke], no, no UI changes in my branch, only content.
[18:45:56] <Altai-man> But then people said "Oh, why bother with this, just improve the docs".
[18:46:28] <Altai-man> So I went and re-imagined the docs website, fixing the silly UI, broken search, added modern features etc
[18:47:13] <Altai-man> then it was ditched with insults and bikeshedding
[18:47:28] <Altai-man> thus we have docs from 2009 and examples from 2009
[18:47:35] <Altai-man> but what I think is that if we have it this way
[18:48:06] <Altai-man> then fixing docs tickets (like missing documentation bits! please, write docs, folks) is more efficient towards users

[19:33:43] <mfiano> This is the third day I spent all day reading Raku literature, and at this point I got a pretty good idea of the language. I just want to take this time to express my intense excitement over this wonder language. Thanks to the team and community!
[19:34:36] <[Coke]> ... I'm glad you're still here after three days of that. :)
[19:34:41] <[Coke]> We're glad to have you.

[19:58:33] <mfiano> There is only 1 thing I don't agree with about the language so far, but that may change.
[20:00:06] <mfiano> Normally languages that have multiple dispatch do not associate methods with classes...they are separate toplevel constructs. I can't see would want to couple behavior to state like this, as it is much less flexible.
[20:00:54] <Altai-man> mfiano, there is no need to associate methods with classes.
[20:01:11] <mfiano> There is no need to even allow it is my point.

[20:04:59] <mfiano> I'll keep this oddity in my mind while I continue reading more about the language. It was just 1 thing that stuck out at me, being familiar with several languages with multiple dispatch
