[00:35:01] <Solbu> I have a friend who is trying out znc for the first time, I have never used it myself. We have a server with 32 IPv4 addresses and a large 48-bit IPv6 space. he has using one IPv4 and one IPv6 for his own use. Can znc bind to both of them, or must he choose one or the other, which is what I suspect he needs?
[00:36:44] <kurahaupo> Solbu: I believe it's possible to bind to multiple addresses
[00:38:00] <Solbu> So he can define two BindHost in the config file?
[00:38:29] <Solbu> He is blind, which is why I'm the one here, and not he himself. ;-)
[00:45:10] <DarthGandalf> What exactly you mean by binding to both of them?
[00:51:30] <Solbu> He want to use both IPs on IRC, dependent on what the server he connects to supports.
[00:52:12] <DarthGandalf> you can configure bind host per network, sure
[01:01:40] <MetaNova> Solbu: to make a network's bindhost (or a user's bindhost, which all networks will use unless a bindhost for the network is specified) listen to a specific ipv4 and a specific ipv6 (or more than one of either) bind to a domain
[01:02:06] <Solbu> He has done exactly that.
[01:02:16] <MetaNova> (and have the domain have an A and AAAA recored)
[01:02:23] <MetaNova> s/red/rd/
[01:02:24] <ZNC-Linker> MetaNova meant: “(and have the domain have an A and AAAA record)”
[01:02:29] <Solbu> a domain points to both an IPv4 and an IPv6, and I have configured PTR for the IPs.
[01:02:36] <MetaNova> oh, cool
[01:03:22] <Solbu> i even managed to fix letsencrypt cert for his client. :-)
