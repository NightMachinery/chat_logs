[01:54:15] <JEEB> so the mov/mp4 parser in FFmpeg is clearly reading that stream
[01:54:40] <joel1nux> So, when I play, it throws up the first frame, the Xine logo "shimmers" and it's over, all within like 2 seconds

[03:03:24] <aphysically> no
[03:03:57] <joel1nux> So, in windows, this played fine...I'd be kind of disappointed if Linux couldn't.
[03:04:40] <JEEB> let me guess, on windows hw decoding got utilized?
[03:04:52] <JEEB> sw decoding should be pretty much the same between OS
[03:05:36] <JEEB> the discrete decoding hardware is usually on graphics side of the hardware, so what is your active GPU?
[03:05:44] <joel1nux> 1060
[03:06:35] <joel1nux> Wouldn't be surprised if windows did hw decoding...how do I use that in linux?  mesa/glxinfo has my card loaded
[03:06:59] <JEEB> ok, so while on windows there is a generic interface implemented by everyone (which can be utilized either through DirectX9 or 11), on linux it's a mess. are you using nvidia drivers or the reverse engineered stuff?
[03:08:08] <joel1nux> nvidia
[03:08:14] <joel1nux> but they seem to support it:  https://developer.nvidia.com/ffmpeg
[03:08:24] <JEEB> well, you mentioned mesa :P
[03:08:32] <JEEB> and mesa is not the official nvidia drivers
[03:08:46] <JEEB> but if you are using the official blob drivers then it is relatively clear

[03:10:05] <JEEB> nvidia used to have another interface called vdpau but they seem to have more or less dropped it

[06:35:32] <Wieku> HI, I have a question regarding ffmpeg cli. I'm sending raw frames and audio through 2 separate named pipes. And I noticed that the audio pipe is being opened only after sending 12 video frames. Is it possible to change that behavior? I couldn't find anything of use in documentation. Thanks
[06:37:49] <aphysically> oh well I'll just parse it out
[06:38:22] <aphysically> I'm writing that ASS style joiner in Python now, and it's a lot faster to read the extradata by dumping the hex with ffprobe than to try to extract the entire ass subtitle

[14:48:04] <btzy> Hello!  I'm trying to figure out the proper ffmpeg command to download some videos from m3u8 streams, and I asked on StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68890149/download-multiple-files-with-ffmpeg-keep-one-stream-from-each-according-to-def) but didn't get any answer.  I'm asking here again in the hope that someone knows.
[14:48:05] <btzy> Essentially, I want to download from multiple m8u8 files, taking the best video and audio streams of each (according to ffmpeg's default definition of "best"), and then mux them into a single file (that will have multiple video and audio streams).
[14:48:16] <btzy> This would work, but uses temporary files:
[14:48:19] <btzy> ffmpeg -i http://example.com/test0.m3u8 -c copy output0.mp4
[14:48:19] <btzy> ffmpeg -i http://example.com/test1.m3u8 -c copy output1.mp4
[14:48:20] <btzy> ffmpeg -i http://example.com/test2.m3u8 -c copy output2.mp4
[14:48:20] <btzy> ffmpeg -i output0.mp4 -i output1.mp4 -i output2.mp4 -map 0 -map 1 -map 2 -c copy output.mp4
[14:48:28] *** Joins: der_richter (~Akemi@p4fde4358.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[14:48:33] <btzy> Is there any way to do it without temporary files?
[14:49:29] <c_14> ffmpeg -i m3a8 -i m3a8 -i m3a8 -c copy out.mp4
[14:49:33] <btzy> (I looked at filter and filter_complex, but those require me to already know which stream in each m3u8 I want)
[14:49:47] <btzy> c_14 Nope that would keep only one video and audio in the output
[14:49:47] <c_14> though I wouldn't output to mp4
[14:50:01] <c_14> oh, best of each
[14:50:01] <btzy> I want to keep one from **each** input
[14:50:06] <btzy> yeah

[21:22:23] <averne_> Hello, I'm working with the H264 parser/decoder. Is there a way to tell how many times a given frame will be used as a reference?
[21:25:08] <JEEB> that goes into such internal specifics that you may be best served by the trace_headers bit stream filter that dumps the NAL units' data
[21:25:18] <JEEB> then you can interpret that data if you really want to
[21:25:58] <JEEB> (there is as far as I know no nice API for it yet, so `ffmpeg -v verbose -i INPUT -map 0:v -c copy -bsf:v trace_headers -f null - 2> trace_headers.log` or so)
[21:31:31] <averne_> that's okay, I'm working with libavcodec not the CLI tools so I assume I'm not as limited
[21:31:46] <averne_> What field of the NAL header should I look for?
[21:32:02] *** Joins: anotheruser (~user@41.44.111.13)

[21:32:47] <JEEB> basically you'd have to check which poc (?) values are utilized as reference in another slice/picture
[21:32:59] <JEEB> pocs might reset at a GOP's end
[21:33:17] <averne_> heh, I'll start reading the spec then. Thanks for the info
[21:33:18] <JEEB> just not sure if AVFrames expose which pocs got referenced
[21:33:39] <averne_> I've seen some things in H264Picture's
[21:33:55] <JEEB> since you generally aren't able to tell from a coded frame how many other frames utilize it, it's just which frames are being utilized by a frame
[21:34:02] <JEEB> (or well, technically a slice probably :P)
[21:34:35] <JEEB> so in any case you only figure out how many times a picture was utilized after you've parsed/decoded the whole GOP
[21:35:00] <averne_> Ah. Basically I'd like to know how long I need to hold a frame in memory.
[21:35:38] <JEEB> with the built-in decoder I don't think that's something you have to think about :D

[21:35:51] <JEEB> you feed it AVPackets and receive AVFrames back

[21:36:46] <averne_> That's in the context of writing a AVHWAccel. Maybe I should've asked in -devel
[21:38:58] <JEEB> right, that's internal development and it highly depends on the API you're trying to build against
