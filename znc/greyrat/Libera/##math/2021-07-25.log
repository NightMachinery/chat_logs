[03:13:55] <anovick> Hey guys, I've conjectured a hypothesis in Linear Algebra that if I have two orthonormal bases B_1 = (v1,...,vN), B_2 = (u1,...,uN) of N-dimensional inner space then for any scalars a and b, the set (av1 + bu1,...,avN + buN) is also an orthonormal basis for the space.
[03:14:07] <anovick> turns out this is false when B_1 = B_2 and a = -b
[03:14:22] <anovick> but I'm trying to grasp restrictions that make it true
[03:15:18] <qergle> maybe orthogonal is better since normality is quickly lost when you scale them
[03:17:26] <anovick> qergle: yea I can see that. isn't there a way to scale them proportionately though? something like C = (t*v1 + (1-t)*u1,..., t*vN + (1-t)*uN) for some 0<t<1 ?

[03:41:17] <tusko> when we're integrating from -5 to -3 we go under the x-axis but there isn't any function bouding below really.
[03:42:11] <tusko> Its this piecewise function { {-4x-14, -5 < x < -3}, {5x/3+3, -3 < x < 0}, {-5x/2 + 3, 0 < x < 4} }

[03:45:34] <qergle> yes, you sign it becuase the integral isn't finding the actual area but a net sum of "signed areas"
[03:46:02] <qergle> for example, if you integrate cos(x) from 0 to 2π you get 0
[03:46:50] <qergle> let's do sin, instead for pedagogic reasons
[03:46:56] <qergle> so sin(x) from 0 to 2π gives 0

[03:50:34] <qergle> ok, so you can add three triangular areas together
[03:50:55] <tusko> You'd have to figure out what the x intercepts are first to get the lengths of the bases.

[05:39:30] <hammond_> or maybe a metric is a distance between two vectors?

[06:01:00] <hammond_> two vs in one g makes it seem like they were the same vector.
[06:01:03] <buster> hammond, g(u,v) = g_{ij} u^i v^j = <u, v>. geometrically, g(u,v) is the product of the lengths of the vectors and the cosine of the angle between them (this is the only thing that defines "length" and "angle"). so if u=v, just the squared length. ok?
[06:01:17] <hammond_> the whole deal of a metric is to equip the manifold with a sense of distance.
[06:03:35] <johnkeats6> not really.
[06:03:41] <buster> distance between two points on a manifold depends on the path between them.
[06:03:45] <hammond_> to me or him?
[06:04:09] <johnkeats6> the point of a metric tensor is to have inner products between vectors.
[06:04:17] <johnkeats6> you can get a distance, but it's stronger than that.

[06:04:28] <Fangs> hammond_: metric on a manifold lets you give the notion of distance and angle in the tangent space at each point
[06:04:35] <Fangs> you can still only do things locally
[06:04:35] <johnkeats6> buster, well, no, the distance is defined as the infimum over all paths.
[06:05:48] <buster> fair enough
[06:06:37] <Fangs> johnkeats6: I thinkn what buster meant you dont directly get the notion of distance, you have to talk about measuring length of a path frist and then take the infinimum
[06:08:13] <buster> yeah. it's a few steps on from just having a metric. but idk if that's what hammond_ was asking about.

[06:09:45] <hammond_> lol this subject really throws a wrech in my gears.
[06:09:59] <Fangs> hammond_: its the greatest lowerbound, you can think of it even in the usual R^n
[06:10:08] <Fangs> there are many ways to get from (0,0) to (1,1)
[06:10:32] <Fangs> a path of length 2 from (0,0) to (0,1) to (1,1)
[06:10:49] <Fangs> or you know.. you can take the hypothenuse, with length sqrt(2)
[06:11:07] <Fangs> the idea is to mimic the notion of distance by selecting the 'smallest' of these bunch
[06:13:31] <Fangs> hammond_: when you are in a manifold, its not entirely obvious what a straight line between two points is
[06:13:38] <Fangs> a metric lets you define that
[06:13:53] <Fangs> moreover, there can be more than one 'straight line' joining two points

[10:34:35] <rue_mohr> ;) sweet
[10:36:18] <rue_mohr> I'm working on a program to help me design a steam engine
[10:36:49] <rue_mohr> I need to make sure the peak torque does not exceed whats available from the available pressure
[10:37:04] <rue_mohr> oof, and its not even 1am
[10:40:30] <HisShadow> how is this integral derived exactly
[10:40:46] <rue_mohr> its a crank
[10:40:51] <rue_mohr> like a bicycle
[10:41:10] <rue_mohr> when the pedal is in-line with you, you can apply no rotary torque
[10:41:31] <rue_mohr> but when the pedal is straight out, you can apply peak torque
[10:41:44] <rue_mohr> so the question is, if you know the average torque, whats the peak
[10:41:58] <rue_mohr> in this case the goal is a 2HP steam engine
[10:42:38] <rue_mohr> so the average torque can be worked out also given its running at 900 rpm  (to be 11.671362 foot*lbs)
[10:42:55] <rue_mohr> ultimitly I need to work out the limit on the piston size
[10:43:28] <rue_mohr> at 200psi, there isn't enough area on a 1cm dia piston to develop that much torque
[10:43:58] <rue_mohr> .. ok there is more to it, but less be said, average and peak relationships need to be known
[10:44:51] <rue_mohr> oh, but the torques do add

[11:28:36] <Fangs> anovick: let V = R^2 and U = span(1,0) and W = span(1,1)
[11:28:44] <Fangs> take the dot product on R^2

[11:30:07] <anovick> I thought the orthogonal decomposition theorem just gives this immediate result

[18:25:02] <pikapika> Koen_, matters might be more subtle in a galois field
[18:25:18] <pikapika> after all, the "normal" way involves square roots
[18:25:31] <cherim> I think |D_{2m}|=2m is group theorist style, |D_m|=2m is genral mathematician/physicist
[18:25:41] <pikapika> And i dont know if square roots can be done in the normal manner in galois
[18:25:56] <Z-module> group theorists violently disagree on the issue
[18:26:23] <pikapika> After all there is no such thing as a square root in a field
[18:26:37] <pikapika> So you may have to manually search for an element whose square equals the number in question
[18:26:56] <riv> some numbers have square roots
[18:27:07] <PlanckWalk> |D_6| = 6 makes perfect sense by analogy with |S_6| = 6.

[23:04:29] <Z-module> [-_-]: I just wanted to comment about the page http://www.suitcaseofdreams.net/properties_modulus.htm that Inline referred you to earlier. I dislike their proofs of #2 and #3, because really those both quickly follow from #1 and shouldn't really get detailed new proofs as they do there. ALSO, #2 and #3 are a bit dumb here: the righthand side should actually be  | |z_1| - |z_2| |
[23:04:56] <Z-module> (what they have on the page is true but is far too weak)
