"i'd rather sit on the floor shoving table knives into live electrical outlets than run webmin on an exposed server."  Removed from Debian post-Sarge, see http://bugs.debian.org/343897 .  The Debian package from webmin.com is of poor quality.  See <free whcp> for alternatives.
[01:48:33] <Rohambili> Unsafe? Bullshit. Not open ports to public .
[01:53:22] <Rohambili> needs to use webmin without open port 1000 0

[02:02:27] <Rohambili> this way you dont need to open to public port 22 or anything to control your server.
[02:02:33] <somiaj> that factoid is not for someone who knows what they are doing and knows the strenghts and limitations of webmin.

[14:31:01] <strk> tried and failed, and I was overreactive by upgrading the whole system from Debian10 to 11...
[14:31:05] <Khepra> well it clearly supports it, regardless of any message you're getting. maybe it checks UA, and you can fake that

[19:04:44] <rawtaz> abrotman: im not harassing anyone. it was a fair and square question. and no, they previously asked something, that i replied to, and then later instead of commenting on that they just asked another quesiton.

[19:05:11] <rawtaz> it's basic courtesy (+speling :-) to at least look if somene replied before you ask another question, IMO

[19:05:47] <rawtaz> no. not even close. what part of what i wrote do you think is wrong, and why?
[19:06:10] <rawtaz> how is it not reasonable to expect that they reply back when they get help, at least when they evidently are online again?
[19:06:22] <abrotman> Show me the contract you or they signed that says you are required to respond before asking another question.
[19:06:31] <abrotman> Cool, carry on! :)
[19:07:11] <rawtaz> abrotman: i never suggested there was any contract. can you please answer the question? if you think my simple rationale isnt fair or reasonable, why?
[19:08:33] <abrotman> It's not.  They can do as they please.  If you don't the way they interact with you, feel free to ignore all future questions.  Good luck

[19:09:25] <rawtaz> abrotman: i am fully aware of that. i never suggested anything else. but that doesnt answer my question. if you are going to sit here accusing me of harassing people, then at the very least when they explain their rationale explain what you disagree wiht?
[19:09:30] <rawtaz> seriously, how hard can this be?
[19:09:54] <rawtaz> but fine. we'll just add to the record then that you dont seem to be able to explain why you think what you say, and move on.

[19:11:46] <abrotman> *thank you
[19:12:10] <rawtaz> abrotman: i agree. and thats why i asked them whats going on. and FWIW, it's still the basic reasonably behavior that if you ask a question and later return to the chat, then *obviously* you scroll up to see if anyone replied. in this case they cannot have missed any replies, because there has hardly been any other chatter going on :)
[19:12:33] <rawtaz> im not trying to argue with you but you seem to think that theres no basic level of effort to be expected by someone actually getting help ;)
