[10:44:57] <gtlsgamr> What do you use?
[10:51:24] <Arya[m]> sway
[11:14:12] <pystardust[m]> <iamak[m]> "Edit in dwm wala config.h?" <- Yes, and recompile

[12:00:30] <gtlsgamr> Arya[m]: So if you use wayland... can you still play games using nvidia card?

[12:37:18] <vipul[m]> For color emoji use joypixel font
[12:37:30] <iamak[m]> Thanks
[12:41:26] <Arya[m]> <gtlsgamr> "Arya: So if you use wayland..." <- I use 2 pcs
[12:41:53] <Arya[m]> one intel in which i use sway and another one which has exwm or some other wm 
[12:42:20] <Arya[m]> <gtlsgamr> "Arya: So if you use wayland..." <- sway wont even run on nvidia non-free lmao
[12:42:31] <Arya[m]> unless you use wlroots-eglstreams fork
[12:43:12] <Arya[m]> if you use non-nvidia they should work normally due to xwayland most of the time
[12:43:27] <Arya[m]> i cant test it out tho because the sway pc is an absolute potato

[14:54:03] <gtlsgamr> What's up
[14:54:17] <Arya[m]> hi
[14:54:48] <gtlsgamr> Whatchoo doin!
[14:55:05] <Arya[m]> rewriting my sway config 
[14:55:43] <Arya[m]> i based it on endeavour's one a while back but now the way they arranged it is starting to irritate me
[14:59:46] <gtlsgamr> What are the major difference you encountered between xorg and whayland?
[15:00:01] <Arya[m]> nothing big for me
[15:00:04] <Arya[m]> its smoother
[15:00:20] <Arya[m]> i have not had that many big issues with wayland compared to xorg
[15:00:33] <Arya[m]> xorg breaks basically every major update for me
[15:00:52] <gtlsgamr> I think that is an Arya[m] issue not an xorg one XD
[15:01:15] <Arya[m]> lol
[15:01:51] <gtlsgamr> I've been planning to move to wayland, just because it is more modern.. but my current setup is too comfortable to get out of
[15:02:21] <Arya[m]> gtlsgamr: lol
[15:02:23] <Arya[m]> DWL should work
[15:02:36] <Arya[m]> i got dynamic tiling on sway with i3-ipc-dynamic-tiling
[15:03:21] <gtlsgamr> But it's still not x though. Not only dwm there's a lot of other shit that makes my Xperience
[15:03:24] <gtlsgamr> get it? ;)
[15:03:26] <gtlsgamr> Xperience
[15:03:35] <Arya[m]> lol
[15:04:03] <Arya[m]> The thing is you cant use wayland software easily on X
[15:04:26] <Arya[m]> I wanted to try waydroid once, but i couldnt because X
[15:04:42] <Arya[m]> the issue is still there for wayland but not as bad due to Xwayland
[16:58:33] <iamak[m]> <Arya[m]> "xorg breaks basically every..." <- Why? Never happened with me
[16:58:51] <Arya[m]> i have had a lot of bad issues with xorg
[16:58:56] <Arya[m]> maybe its just the wms i use 
[17:04:53] <iamak[m]> F
[17:05:29] <iamak[m]> I installed dwm this year but have been using Arch with X for quite a while (mostly kde)

[18:19:38] <telegram_8037364> bros is there a way to get pid of the mpv process launched here, i tired & $! but it returns pid of bash https://x0.at/TlvH.sh... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/41b6f6a7dc4ef25837f90bac2533e8535e5d6eb2)
[18:47:29] <pystardust> telegram_8037364: it should return mpv's only, check again
[18:50:21] <pystardust> on a side note, wait will wait for all the subprocess spawned by the current script (it is not necessary to explicitly mention its pid (unless you want to wait for it specifically))
[18:50:28] <gtlsgamr> pystardust: can u see the symbols?
[18:50:36] <pystardust> no, its boxes
