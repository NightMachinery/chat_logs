[01:03:01] <sybariten> hey
[01:03:27] <bagder> o/
[01:04:56] <sybariten> i have this mega vague network related question/problem/idea that probably spans over a coupla different technologies so i may definitely be lacking in the required skills but i figured the people of #curl might know something about what i need to look into, at least

[01:05:44] *** Joins: spare (~qrlij26rj@user/spareproject)
[01:06:02] <sybariten> So: given a measly basic home LAN with a coupla machines, what is the required components i would need in place on a linux machine, to be able to receive a HTTP POST request, and have that actually do something to the machine?
[01:06:26] <sybariten> With "do", i was thinking something like echo a hello world to a file in /tmp
[01:06:43] <bagder> you need an HTTP server running on one of the machines
[01:07:06] <bagder> then you'd have to do something to make a POST to it do what you want it to do
[01:08:14] <sybariten> background: i have a printer connected to this machine and the end goal is actually to print to this printer. There is an android app called "autoshare" that allows you to share almost anything to a HTTP POST request, they say, annd i wanted to try if its possible to do this from the phone to the printer in the LAN
[01:08:44] <sybariten> and i figure maybe people try out POST things with curl sometimes, so that i could start in that end
[01:08:49] *** Quits: spare (~qrlij26rj@user/spareproject) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:09:22] <sybariten> bagder: do you think i need to go full apache, even though i'm technicallly not planning to do much "web" ? Or are there more specialized servers just for this?
[01:10:41] <bagder> I don't know exactly what alternatives there are, but I bet most of them will do "http server" in general terms and then you end up with something like http apache or some alternative
[01:11:07] <sybariten> Hmmm ok
[01:11:11] <bagder> and for you, just using a server, I doubt there's much difference
[01:11:43] <bagder> I think the bigger question is how you want to program the POST receiver thing in the server
[01:12:22] <bagder> but I'm not an expert on http server side installations or solutions
[01:12:34] <sybariten> oh my goodness i think someone (as is often the case, innit) posted the perfect question for me, at superuser  https://superuser.com/questions/709649/whats-needed-to-have-a-shell-script-run-via-http-post-request
[01:13:04] <bagder> right and ... "I would install Apache and PHP on the server" ...
[01:14:38] <sybariten> yep

[18:34:19] <}8]> hi. im trying to figure out the correct POST request to make that triggers a file download. using a browser clicking the download button on "https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/" sends you to a page to choose the server to download from. clicking a server button somehow does a request that returns (i think) the final url to the file. im missing something but cant figure out 
[18:34:19] <}8]> what. anyone mind taking a quick look?

[18:56:25] <ajak> bring up your browser's "dev tools" (probably hit f12) and look at the network tab to see what request is made that produces the file download
[19:00:13] <}8]> i did check with `http live headers` and `TamperData` extentions in firefox. i get get the file id (id=1998) and server id (server_id=2) but the last POST i see that actually results in the save file popup, doesnt contain either of those
[19:00:58] <}8]> its a bit confusing. i shouldve prefaced with, im not a http/web/js guy at all so just winging it here, and failing so far :\
[19:06:37] <moparisthebest> Dev tools? That's illegal!
[19:08:36] <ajak> }8]: it looks to me like you POST to a /download/ URL whichhas the id and server_id but the response code there is a 302 so you get redirected to the mirror of your choosing, which you GET
[19:12:16] <ajak> hm, i'm not sure how to produce curl commands that would demonstrate this for you as you need to see the response headers (usually a HEAD request) and do a POST to get the redirect, but obviously can't do both at the same time :P
[19:13:13] <ajak> oh, just -v is fine; http://dpaste.com/9X3KF4M9T
[19:13:33] <ajak> you can see at the bottom you get 302'd to location: https://us2-dl.techpowerup.com/files/X5eIUiRJ73FpXODRom4LbQ/1636774977/GPU-Z.2.43.0.exe and that's the location of the exe you want
[19:14:01] <ajak> bagder: congrats! :)

[19:25:43] <compnerd> Hmm, I'm seeing an odd thing - in the last ~2 days, an unresolved symbol has shown up: `Curl_connect_done` being referenced from `Curl_detach_connnection` on Windows
[19:27:56] <compnerd> I suspect that its related to f0b7099a10d1a7cfbbe8f67b0ecdff5846f9805b, but I'm going to do another build and see if it was something in an odd state

[19:39:39] <}8]> hi ajak, had to run a quick errand and just back now. lemme check out your paste real quick. thank you for checking btw!
[19:40:29] <ajak> no problem
[19:43:01] <}8]> yeah that works like a charm! so it was just a matter of revealing hidden headers in the response :)
[19:43:10] *** Joins: Jaxx (~Jaxx@user/jaxx)
[19:44:46] <ajak> yes, browser's dev tools are very helpful here since you can see each request being made and the response code to figure out exactly what the flow is

[20:00:00] <bagder> compnerd: built without proxy support?
[20:00:20] <compnerd> bagder: I believe so
[20:00:39] <bagder> then I think your issue is fixed in master
[20:01:10] <compnerd> ah, awesome!  thanks!
[20:01:36] <compnerd> set(CURL_DISABLE_PROXY YES CACHE BOOL "") - yeap, double checked, it is indeed with proxy support disabled

[20:04:54] <compnerd> thanks bagder!  hadn't dug into it yet, figured Id ask early and save myself some trouble in case it was already known
