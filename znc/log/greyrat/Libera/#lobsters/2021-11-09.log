[00:04:08] <kline> looking this up, the other thing i found is that puzzle rings have existed since antiquity, being deliberately difficult to put on correctly and in pattern, so that it was easier to spot infidelity since it was difficult to remove and replace the ring without assistance
[00:04:24] <JordiGH> I kind of like how you can put anything into a QR code. There's no size limit either, is there? I can put the complete works of William Shakespeare, verbatim, into a QR code?
[00:04:42] <gerikson> uh
[00:04:49] <gerikson> well I guess it's up the resolution?
[00:04:55] <kline> JordiGH, the limit is to do with readability
[00:05:01] <ngoldbaum> would be hard to get that in a single photo
[00:05:13] <JordiGH> Aerial photography at high resolution.
[00:05:14] <kline> at large size there are various photographic realities that make it difficult to read
[00:05:17] <wink> I love: "Netherlands [if not Catholic], Norway and Spain (except in the Catalan-speaking regions)."
[00:05:29] <varjag> see
[00:05:32] <varjag> it's the catholics.
[00:05:34] <ngoldbaum> i fucking hate how menus are qr codes now btw
[00:05:52] <JordiGH> ngoldbaum: If that happens and they don't have a physical menu, I just ask the waiter to tell me what to get.
[00:05:59] <JordiGH> Lucky for me I'm not picky.
[00:06:12] <varjag> but now i know how to spot a married swede in a crowd of norwegians
[00:06:18] <ngoldbaum> i understand that menus suck at restaurants for the owners and employees but i hate how it forces everyone on their phones at the beginning of a meal

[00:14:12] <JordiGH> I think the only one I like is "Player 1" and "Player 2" because it's the only one that isn't just based on someone else's story... but then there's the problem of deciding who is 1 and who is 2.

[00:21:09] <varjag> in which way it did

[00:22:08] <JordiGH> Or am I setting the bar too low?

[14:37:03] <bsandro> yeah I agree; some (mobile) internet providers inject their garbage into plain http though, that can be irritating
[14:37:48] <bsandro> in general I'm fine with http as well, just couple of internal resources got plaintext auth that is not a good idea to send absolutely unencrypted.

[14:43:25] <dacav> also, of course if there's auth there must be https, definitely.

[19:35:55] <asthasr> the basic gist is that if you have w = f(v), x = g(w), y = h(x), z = j(y) or some similar tree of dependent functions, the input at the UX/primary usage level should be just "w" (or the minimal set of inputs) and they should be passed to a function or API as a group and the result passed back as a group.
[19:36:31] <asthasr> The idea being to eliminate erroneous intermediate state that might cascade "downward" through the tree and compound into surprising error
[19:37:16] <asthasr> (such as is encouraged by React et al. with change handlers and state that isn't "connected" at all)

[20:36:28] <Teckla> I have never used Facebook, for moral and ethical reasons.
[20:36:53] <wink> varjag: well I still used them in the late 90s, very early 00s
[20:37:10] <iDrougge> Teckla: But the argument was about Facebook, wasn't it?
[20:37:13] <wink> maybe they were deader already than before, but defo still around
[20:37:23] <varjag> comp.* hierarchy was pretty decent
[20:37:31] <varjag> but soft subjects, well
[20:37:41] <gwozniak> varjag: yeah, I stopped paying attention to all but one newsgroup by 2003
[20:37:42] <varjag> it was already a preview of social networks
[20:37:45] <iDrougge> wink: I think they died somewhere around 2005, perhaps as early as 2003.
[20:37:49] <Teckla> iDrougge: True :)
[20:38:10] * Teckla still visits Usenet once every week or two
[20:38:42] <iDrougge> varjag: Usenet was probably just as bad as Reddit, but at least it wasn't owned and controlled by Reddit. It was a commons.
[20:38:45] <wink> I mean.. I got online at 98 and the web was kinda formative for me, in computing and teen years. I'm not saying I'm not biased
[20:38:45] <gwozniak> Usenet was a wonderful world of insanity when I started being online, but I quickly found it to be a cesspool
[20:39:22] <varjag> iDrougge: i feel subjectively it wasn't as bad as reddit, but perhaps due to relative obscurity
[20:39:24] <gwozniak> varjag: comp.* was about the only decent place
[20:39:38] <varjag> the medians of extreme viewpoints were never as dramatic
[20:39:47] <wink> some rec.*.starwars was mildly interesting
[20:39:58] <iDrougge> varjag: Subjectively, I don't feel that either, but considering that the main audience is identical, it may be just subjectively.
[20:40:04] <gwozniak> alt.* was mostly horrible
[20:40:05] <c355E3B> Web Forums have UX issues that nobody has iterated on
[20:40:11] <c355E3B> whoo scrollback
[20:40:19] <gwozniak> c355E3B: yes
[20:40:35] <c355E3B> Discoruse did a pass and we have that
[20:40:41] <c355E3B> but there is nothing to play off of
[20:40:42] <iDrougge> The main UX issue is that they conflate data and UI.
[20:40:52] <gwozniak> following a convo on web forums always kind of sucked
[20:41:02] <varjag> yeah
[20:41:06] <varjag> it was inferior tech
[20:41:13] <varjag> but it worked in browser nicely
[20:41:17] <iDrougge> Most people used bad UIs for Usenet, but at least I didn't have to use the same bad UI as everyone else.
[20:41:31] <gwozniak> Eudora!
[20:41:49] <varjag> that's a word i haven't heard uttered in a long time
[20:41:51] <gwozniak> Or the Usenet Eudora clone whose name I have since forgotten
[20:43:41] <iDrougge> What usenet never really had, and forums have always had, was persistence. Those forums that are as old as the death of Usenet now have a wealth of information you can search through, some of it even written by dead people.
[20:44:34] <iDrougge> OTOH, every forum that has ever been closed or migrated to some incompatible platform, is gone forever unlike newsgroups which can survive on someone's hard drive.
[20:44:58] <gwozniak> Account management on web forums is a mess
[20:45:07] <gwozniak> At least, on the old ones
[20:45:22] <wink> I liked https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezboard
[20:45:23] <mockturtle> [ ezboard - Wikipedia ] - en.wikipedia.org
[20:45:47] <wink> free hosting, you had a shared account on all of them (think Stack Overflow) and could easily discover other topics
[20:46:04] <iDrougge> I think web forums bear a certain resemblance to the technologies that they were created in; PHP.
[20:46:19] <wink> technically ugly but gets the job done, yes
[20:46:35] <gwozniak> It was always fun to post HTML snippets
[20:46:37] <iDrougge> Awful UX.
[20:46:46] <gwozniak> See if they rendered wackily
[20:47:09] <gwozniak> I see the ezboard.com link goes to the internet archive
[20:47:27] <gwozniak> On wikipedia, at least
[20:47:35] <wink> > On May 31, 2005, ezboard claimed they were hacked, causing many boards to lose information, become inaccessible, or be completely wiped
[20:47:42] <iDrougge> So will Reddit.com, one day.
[20:47:48] <wink> it was definitely around 2000-2003 when I used it
[20:48:03] <Church> Now I'm just thinking of Ebaum's World
[20:48:19] <wink> > ezboard was written in Smalltalk VisualWorks 3.1 by Vanchau Nguyen with Jay O'Connor
[20:48:20] <wink> TIL
[20:48:23] <kline> stupidvideos.com
[20:48:34] <gwozniak> oh those days of crazy comedy sites
[20:48:38] <gwozniak> memories
[20:48:54] <gwozniak> ebaum's world will always hold a place in my heart
[20:49:03] <iDrougge> I wonder if they also write about the advantage it gave them so they can now sit and blog all days while they run their incubator.
[20:50:22] <gwozniak> I listened to a guy who used to work for College Humor who said that Facebook totally killed them because of how much FB lied about how effective their video feeds were
[20:50:42] <gwozniak> He was pretty pissed about it
[20:51:01] <wink> that all-in for video always sounded weird to me
[20:51:20] <wink> but I learned to not let my opinion cloud my judgement of the masses, so not claiming told you so here
[20:51:32] <gwozniak> So the biz folks went for the FB video feeds and there was, apparently, no way out

[23:34:29] <Brekkjern> Best part is that it doesn't even have any power requirements.
