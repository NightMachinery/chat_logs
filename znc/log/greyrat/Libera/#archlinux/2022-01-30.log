[00:04:41] <nij-> Hello :) I'm struggling with font configuration. My issue is that `fc-match monospace` keeps returning a font I don't want. As "monospace" is rendered in many places, I'd like to change this without removing that font from system. In `~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf` I set Inconsolata as the preference (https://bpa.st/6Z4Q), and indeed before starting X, `fc-match monospace` does return Inconsolata. I've checked both the global
[00:04:41] <nij-> settings and user X settings (eg /etc/X11/xorg.conf and /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d), they are not existent.. so I wonder what's happening here, and how I can change the behavior of `fc-match monospace` as I wish. Thank you so much!

[01:25:28] <thurstylark> just curious how that happens :P
[01:25:39] <BrainDamage> that's because the bridge has a shared buffer
[01:25:45] <kode54> yes
[01:25:57] <kode54> the bridge has a shared virtual matrix channel that contains the backlog of the channel
[01:26:03] <BrainDamage> so it bridges channels, besides the users
[01:26:06] <kode54> as long as a single bridged user is in the channel, the buffer gets filled

[04:18:07] <kevr> the hardware could just be misbehaving
[04:18:22] <kevr> did this just start recently?
[04:18:35] <thurstylark> I agree, but I think the misbehavior might be the cause of the lockups, not just logspam
[04:19:04] <kevr> perhaps, yeah
[04:19:05] <thurstylark> nah, started about a month ago.

[07:08:20] <rienske> first of all it's a great learning experience, and also i somehow feel that gui programs use way too many resources in some cases.
[07:08:22] <Gildric> not necessarily, but the right tool for the right job goes a long way
[07:09:17] <rienske> a machine like that eepc doesn't work well with everything gui. it would be a shame to not being able to use it.

[13:46:50] <The-Compiler> oh wait that's actually Qt 6, so it seems to be the same for both
[13:48:30] <The-Compiler> though I can't find the place where it's actually passed to Chromium's build stuff in Qt 6, in Qt 5 it seems to be here: https://github.com/qt/qtwebengine/blob/v5.15.8-lts/src/buildtools/config/common.pri#L73-L96
[13:48:35] <arojas> hmm "label": "Compile libs in debug and release mode" <- don't think this is what I want
[13:48:46] <arojas> but force_debug_info sounds right
[13:48:50] <The-Compiler> yeah
[13:48:59] <The-Compiler> but I have no idea honestly, so far I've always built a full developer build
[13:49:29] <The-Compiler> which is so slow you can't use it for day-to-day usage, so I love the work y'all (mostly Foxboron and you?) are doing
[13:50:22] <arojas> I'm just rebuilding packages, it's mostly Foxboron you have to thank

[16:52:03] <leana> I'm trying to create a customised keyboard layout, I added my own configuration to the french symbol file `fr` and added this entry to `evdev.lst` and `evdev.xml`. I can see the entry in gnome but when I type it's just plain qwerty. What's wrong ?

Here bindir defaults to /usr/lib/<arch triple> e.g. /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ Has arch such multiarch details? Is there usrmerge in arch?

[23:11:36] <BrainDamage> he's arguing that you still have the config, it's just a default one autosourced
[23:11:39] <teraflops> mkinitcpio -p linux -- --uefi /efi/EFI/Linux/arch-systemd.efi vs grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg?
[23:11:52] <teraflops> I don't get it
[23:11:52] <Earnestly> Well not autosourced, part of tool logic directly
[23:12:12] <Foxboron> teraflops: one generates a fragile and complicated config. One is litterally just a single file

[23:17:29] <BrainDamage> italian's version is "neighbour's grass/weed is always greener" and people turn it into "my weed's better tho"
[23:17:39] <teraflops> heh
[23:18:01] <Earnestly> No, grub is complicated, it is whole OS and config is sh script
[23:18:25] <teraflops> there's a lot of history behind having a garden in front of the hose full of grass

[23:18:47] <Foxboron> When you need 200+ patches to ensure things are not sideloaded + have a new verifiecation system because you want grub to run in a secure context.. well
[23:19:28] <teraflops> that's another topic, I though we were talking about config files
[23:20:04] <Foxboron> I'm a bit beyond that, but half of these issues has been the fact that grub isn't able to parse it's own files correctly
[23:20:11] <Foxboron> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
