[09:51:39] <corwin> FYI, office hour has ended for today; thanks all for attendign!
[09:52:04] <sachac> I'm trying to not look at submissions until they're anonymized, but it would be great if someone could send acknowledgements so that people don't stress about lost emails.
[09:52:23] <sachac> corwin: Any chance you want to take that on? :)
[09:52:32] <sachac> thanks for doing office hours!
[09:52:35] <edrx> np =)

[09:54:46] <corwin> sachac: yes, I think.  I need to hit the road first thing in the AM to join family for a vakay so I won't do it until Monday after work.  Would that be okay, do you think?
[09:55:07] <sachac> corwin: sounds perfect
[09:55:35] <corwin> then it's a plan!  I'll confirm when I'm digging in so you can flog me for slacking if needed :D
