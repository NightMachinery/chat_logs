[19:30:34] <merijn> "Haskell docs are so terrible!"
[19:30:41] <merijn> Meanwhile in python: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tracemalloc.html#tracemalloc.Filter.filename_pattern
[19:30:53] <merijn> How the fuck am I supposed to interpret that?!?
[19:31:58] <merijn> Does it accept wildcards? regexes? only literals?
[19:33:25] <abastro[m]> Is it frequently accessed library?
[19:33:50] <abastro[m]> Btw I think some ppl might even complain with mtl documentation
[19:33:57] <merijn> It's in the python standard lib, so...
[19:33:58] <abastro[m]> Because it sounds too technical.
[19:40:10] <abastro[m]> Oh, other side of batteries included
[19:43:17] <tdammers> merijn: that's par for the course for documentation in a dynamic language
[19:44:39] <tdammers> I mean, I give you https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/conj, for example
[19:44:51] <merijn> tdammers: I know it is
[19:45:09] <merijn> Which is why people bitching about haskell docs like they're worse than other languages annoy me so much
[19:45:33] <tdammers> "The 'addition' may happen at different 'places' depending on the concrete type" - OK, fine, but why the ominous quotes, and why won't you tell me which types it accepts and where the 'addition' happens for each of them?
[19:45:59] <tdammers> to which our resident clojure guru would say: "just read the source code"
[19:55:11] <abastro[m]> Well, they love learn by example I guess.
[19:55:23] <abastro[m]> I've seen that many do, unlike us haskellers
[19:55:48] <abastro[m]> So they just see a few examples and then understand how it works vaguely.
[19:58:59] <tomsmeding> merijn: "See the fnmatch.fnmatch() function for the syntax of filename_pattern."
[19:59:39] <tomsmeding> I mean, they could have added that to the parameter docs as well, but technically it's there

[20:53:50] <__monty__> Haskellers and people who like learning by example aren't disjoint sets.
[20:54:23] <tdammers> examples are great
[20:54:35] <tdammers> it's just that having nothing BUT examples is terrible

[21:53:42] <monochrom> I do symbolic examples, e.g., I write like "map f [a, b, c] = [f a, f b, f c]", rather than "map (+ 1) [1, 2, 3] = [2, 3, 4]". In general, I think of what the audience can extrapolate, what they can't, and design my example accordingly. It is amazing how much people can extrapolate correctly. Don't diss examples.
[21:57:44] <monochrom> Some symbolic examples (plus the audience's extrapolation power) are so powerful that I don't even bother to give a wordy "general" "explanation" (most of which are clumsy if it needs to be precise and unambiguous, therefore the audience always misread).

[22:04:36] <river> I think one thing that's tricky with being new to haskell is learning that you have permission to substitute equals
[22:04:51] <monochrom> Yes.
[22:05:56] <monochrom> When teaching Haskell, I explain that on day 1. I say "I won't say return, I will say equal, these are math functions, this is algebra".
