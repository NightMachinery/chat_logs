[02:02:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> jemius: baseband I/Q conversion means that the LO is at your tuned frequency. Which means that any leakage between LO and RF input will produce an auto correlated DC output. Many radios reduce this in hardware. If the hardware doesn’t you have to deal with it in software.

[02:21:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> But the IF amplifier might have a bit of DC offset on it.

[02:23:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> Derek Kozel: Indeed, despite your best efforts, you may still end up with small amounts of DC-offset and I/Q imbalance, ,which you have to remove digitally.  Although what I've noticed is that at least for DC-offset, the residual can *usually* be removed by adequately swamping the residual DC offset with actual external-world signal.

[03:27:27] <Yamakaja[m]> Wow, how'd you get your hands on that?
[03:28:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> It's not "ours"--we're working on a collaboration with the current site owners, who approached us to investigate use for radio astronomy.   The site was purchased "as is" from the Canadian Government a  few years ago.  It is, as you might imagine "solid".   Poured concrete walls everywhere, etc.

[03:30:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> Site isn't likely that suitable for most types of "deep sky" radio astronomy, because it's too close to civilization.  But for some projects, will probably be suitable.  We're doing some evaluation--both RF and mechanical.

[09:31:21] <junagarhi1[m]> Hi, I would like to inquire things about sampling rate, what is the relation of sampling rate used in different blocks of flow graph and the sampling rate of the SDR?
[09:35:39] <muaddib[m]> Have you looked at this tutorial?
[09:35:39] <muaddib[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Sample_Rate_Tutorial
[09:47:07] <junagarhi1[m]> I have just gone through the tutorial, the concepts used were somehow known to me, but my question is how the hardware such as usrp or any other sdr handles that rate for example my flowgraph gives 32k samples to usrp and usrp has sampling rate of 1M, what does this have effect on the transmitted signal.
[09:56:40] <muaddib[m]> You will probably experience underruns. Meaning the USRP is asking for more data than you are giving it.
[09:57:58] *** Joins: harish (~harish@158.140.144.42)
[09:58:42] <junagarhi1[m]> you mean that the sampling rate in the flow graph and the sampling rate of the sdr should be wqual

[10:09:29] <muaddib[m]> Sort of. In your case, you are telling the radio that it should expect 1 million samples per second, then only giving it 32,000. 
[10:09:30] <muaddib[m]> If you truly need your source sample rate to be 32ksps for a specific operation, you’ll need to upsample to the USRP rate before the UHD sink. 
[10:09:30] <muaddib[m]> What are you trying to do?
[10:11:27] <junagarhi1[m]> I was running bpsk tutorial in order to transmit it through some sdr and this question arised
[10:16:05] <muaddib[m]> So you’re splitting the simulation examine into TX and RX from this tutorial?
[10:16:05] <muaddib[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Simulation_example:_BPSK_Demodulation
[10:16:25] <junagarhi1[m]> yes!
[10:22:22] <muaddib[m]> Oh ok. I’m not at my machine to test but I would suggest inserting a rational resampler block before the UHD sink and also insert one right after the UHD source on the RX side. 
[10:22:22] <muaddib[m]> For TX, you will need to upsample, so change the interpolation value. A note with the rational resampler is that you’ll need to use an integer value, so you’re 1Msps rate should be an integer multiple of 32000. Such that:
[10:22:22] <muaddib[m]> UHD sampling rate = Input samp rate * interp value
[10:23:08] <muaddib[m]> On the RX side, you’ll need to decimate, so it’s the same process in reverse.
[10:23:57] <muaddib[m]> Which USRP are you using?
[10:24:15] <junagarhi1[m]> > <@muaddib:gnuradio.org> Oh ok. I’m not at my machine to test but I would suggest inserting a rational resampler block before the UHD sink and also insert one right after the UHD source on the RX side.

[10:39:22] <muaddib[m]> Oh ok. The hardware sampling rate considerations are different for the different SDRs. For the Pluto, it uses an AD9361 chip, you probly have a minimum sampling rate of 200ksps. On the TX side, I would set your hardware sample rate to 256ksps, the rational resampler interpolation value to 8. 
[10:39:22] <muaddib[m]> 32k * 8 = 256k
[10:39:22] <muaddib[m]> Make sense?

[10:40:04] <junagarhi1[m]> Yes I got it!
[10:42:44] <muaddib[m]> Great! 
[10:42:44] <muaddib[m]> FYI, the N210 is a little different though. It has a 100mhz clock rate for the ADC, so you’ll need to send in a sample rate divisible by 100. That may take a bit more thought in the design aspect. 
[10:42:44] <muaddib[m]> Try continuing with your Pluto for now and continue asking questions if you have them. 
[10:42:44] <muaddib[m]> Have fun!
[10:43:18] <junagarhi1[m]> Thank you very much
[10:44:52] <patchvonbraun[m]> N210 supports rates that divide 100MHz evenly, up to a divisor of 512, which is 195ksps or so
[10:45:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> factor-of-2 or factor-of-4 preferred
[10:45:45] <junagarhi1[m]> What if i increase the sample rate of every block to intended sample rate of the sdr, i think that should also work.
[10:47:27] <junagarhi1[m]> I have another question! ho does the gnuradio produce carrier out of the hardware? Also is it a sine wave or cosine wave? 
[10:47:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> Keep in mind that Gnu Radio has NO inherent notion of sample-rate, and MANY blocks other than hardware blocks that accept a sample-rate parameter are doing so merely to compute things like normalized fitlers.
[10:48:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> The hardware takes your complex baseband in digital form, and mixes it in a quadrature mixer along with a local-oscillator to produce the final output frequency.
[10:48:59] <junagarhi1[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: so the sample rate actually has not much effect overall withi the flowgraph?
[10:50:28] <junagarhi1[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: what will be the type of the signal upon which the message is modulated?
[10:50:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> Sample-rate is a concept that has "meaning" (in the actual real-world temporal sense) at the edges, where the hardware is.  GNu Radio just streams samples.  HOWEVER.  Lots of processing blocks need to "know" the sample rate in order to compute operational parameters.
[10:51:53] <junagarhi1[m]> I understand its meaning in real world, but the way it is used in gnu radio is very confusing for me
[10:52:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> junagarhi1: THere are literally *hundreds* of different ways that information can be impressed on a carrier signal.  The blocks in Gnu Radio are used to implement those methods.  The radio is, typically, "dumb".  It has no idea what the semantics of the signals are.
[10:53:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> junagarhi1: You probably need more background about digital signal processing.  Spend some time on the gnuradio.org website, whcih has pointers to general DSP stuff.
[10:53:50] <junagarhi1[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: I just want to understand what type of signal we will have in the air ? theoratically what we have studied is its modulation on sine wave or cosine wave!!
[10:54:26] <junagarhi1[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: yes you are right. i am trying to grasp these things!!
[10:54:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> Spend some time on the gnuradio.org site, AND the sites it points to about background.
[10:55:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> If radio is a mystery to you (and it sounds like it might be), then I can recommend the first several chapters of the ARRL handbook.
[10:56:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> Nobody here can teach you all the background information.  We're all reasonably friendly, but none of us can fill in all the background--there's too much of it.
[10:56:19] <junagarhi1[m]> patchvonbraun[m]: can you please provide a link to it?
[10:56:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> Google is your friend
