[00:01:56] <blkshp> It's a little much
[00:02:05] <blkshp> a simple VPN would suffice
[00:02:14] <GuiToris> VPN isn't free

[00:03:14] <blkshp> Yes, you should.
[00:04:24] <TimMc> There are free VPNs, as long as you don't mind the VPN owner *definitely* keeping logs of where you browse to.
[00:04:40] <TimMc> (which is generally fine for this kidn of purpose)
[00:04:56] <fkcen> so i was looking for someone who would kindly just take two screenshots for me (odds for next italian president on one or two major uk betting sites) and paste them somewhere for me (like here: https://pasteboard.co/ 
[00:05:02] <GuiToris> I can't see why blkshp is opposed to Tor, but ok, it's his choice
[00:05:02] <fkcen> and pass me the link :)
[00:05:22] <fkcen> that's all

[09:44:17] <wenxin> hi,there. Does keep English journal would improve writing skill? I had kept journal for couple months, but it's impossible for me to recognize the mistake. Is anyone would give me some advice on this?
[09:44:29] *** Quits: Awaru (Awaru@gateway/vpn/airvpn/awaru) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:45:05] <Me-me> Keeping a journal would help you practice, and in that way it can help you get better, but it won't give you skills at writing that you don't already possess.

[09:46:43] <twb> wenxin: what you are talking about is called "assessment".  It is important and it is very hard to do yourself.
[09:46:50] *** Quits: great_taste (~great_tas@user/great-taste/x-5798414) (Quit: Client closed)
[09:47:00] <twb> This is why schools and universities still exist, even though you could just buy a textbook and read it
[09:47:24] *** Parts: katsuragi (katsuragi@tilde.institute) (WeeChat 2.9)
[09:48:07] <wenxin> twb: i mean the normal writing, like writing a email or something like that
[09:48:10] <twb> wenxin: perhaps as a method that has built-in assessment, you could write to a "pen pal"?
[09:48:50] <twb> wenxin: just writing to yourself will not help much because there is no outside assessment.  So, as you say, you will not know when you make a mistake.
[09:50:28] <wenxin> twb: what kind of textbook it is ?
[09:50:52] <spinningCat> I heard something like bury the hatched but I dont know if it is correct. Is there an idiom similar to this?
[09:51:04] <twb> wenxin: for example when I was 9 I read a lot of particle physics textbooks
[09:51:10] <twb> spinningCat: "bury the hatchet"
[09:51:16] <spinningCat> heh
[09:51:26] <twb> spinningCat: a hatchet is a small (one-handed) axe
[09:51:26] <spinningCat> okay what does that mean?
[09:51:29] <CuriosTiger> wenxin: In my opinion, writing a journal does help practice writing and even thinking in a new language. However, having conversations with others helps more, and will give you important feedback on mistakes.
[09:51:39] <CuriosTiger> IRC is actually quite useful for that purpose.
[09:51:58] <twb> spinningCat: I don't know why, but it refers to ending an argument
[09:52:16] <spinningCat> ah so like close the subject
[09:52:29] <spinningCat> or stop talking about t
[09:52:31] <spinningCat> it*
[09:52:37] <spinningCat> lets bury the hatchet
[09:52:43] <spinningCat> does that make sense?
[09:52:54] <twb> spinningCat: usually it is about a family feud
[09:52:56] <wenxin> CuriosTiger: thank you. I can not agree with you more. :D

[09:53:52] <twb> spinningCat: but it could also be e.g. Hamas and Knesset
[09:54:31] <twb> spinningCat: and yes, "let's bury the hatchet" makes sense.  Like "Let's let bygones be bygones"
[09:54:40] <spinningCat> twb,  in Turkish we have some similar word i guess i understand you
[09:54:42] <spinningCat> ah
[09:54:45] <wenxin> CuriosTiger: I think that it would be more efficient if i share my journal whit people here, then the mistakes would be identified .
[09:54:53] <spinningCat> let bygones be bygones seems another idiom
[09:54:57] <spinningCat> am i correct?
[09:55:02] <twb> spinningCat: not necessarily become friends, but stop being enemies or stop an old grievance
[09:55:15] <twb> spinningCat: yes it is another idiom
[09:55:46] <wenxin> Can anyone help me with this idiom " make it count " mean?
[09:56:08] <CuriosTiger> "make it count" means to make sure your effort serves a purpose.
[09:56:11] <twb> I wonder if anyone in Turkey is still bitter/angry about when Turkey forced all its Christians to move to Greece (and Greece forced all its Muslims to move to Turkey)
[09:56:11] <spinningCat> okay let bygones be bygones is similar to bury the hatchet
[09:56:17] <CuriosTiger> spinningCat: Yes.
[09:56:24] <CuriosTiger> twb: Yes.
[09:56:30] <spinningCat> i heard bury the hatchet in british TV show
[09:56:41] <wenxin> which occasion should i use it ?
[09:56:44] <spinningCat> i bet let bygones be bygones is American alternative
[09:56:57] <twb> spinningCat: often it is used in a comedy case as a double entendre, where the other meaning is literal
[09:57:20] <twb> spinningCat: as in "yes, I will stop fighting your mother in law -- after I chop off her head with an axe and bury her and the axe"
[09:57:37] <spinningCat> yeah thats quiet literal
[09:57:56] <twb> to "bury" the axe in her chest/head
[09:58:08] <spinningCat> dont forget to bury corpse and axe at diffetent place :D
[09:58:12] <spinningCat> aha
[09:58:28] <spinningCat> yeah you can fantasize more about that killing scene
[09:58:37] <spinningCat> i guess you played game Outlast
[09:58:39] <twb> Like in The Shining where the novelist one-shots the caretaker
[09:58:43] <spinningCat> :D
[09:59:16] <spinningCat> understand
[09:59:26] <spinningCat> but you know what they say
[09:59:34] <spinningCat> what goes around comes around
[09:59:37] <twb> the caretaker is like "I'm getting psychic messages something is afoot" and he goes to the place like "I'll investigate" and the novelist is like "not today, Poirot!" and buries the axe in his heart before he even knows what is going on
