[00:31:33] <Seng> hey, I just dipped my toes in lua yesterday by writing a wireshark dissector (inspecting a proprietary protocol). I have a file to handle the protocol, and now I've made a second file to help fill some data into wireshark. We have our network protocol described in a bunch of XML files, which I've now successfully managed to read into a table.
[00:33:02] <Seng> Next step is that in my xml-reading file, let's call it xmlReader.lua, i have a `local xmlReader = { packageInfo = {} }`. And then I have a `function xmlReader.new()` which populates the `xmlReader.packageInfo` with my data.
[00:33:14] <Seng> ..and returns the xmlReader
[00:34:10] <Seng> This is where I want to use that returned xmlReader table and have some helper methods for looking up data. so I want to run `returnedXmlReader:getTypeInfo(typeId)`
[00:34:31] <Seng> but I'm very confused over the difference between : and .
[00:34:44] <Seng> So could someone ELI5 for someone who knows C# ? 
[00:35:22] <Albright> Seng: It's a common question. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32080972/lua-colon-notation-self-and-function-definition-vs-call
[00:35:33] <Habbie> C#, like many languages, knows how objects work
[00:35:35] <Habbie> Lua doesn't
[00:35:49] <Habbie> oh that looks like a good link, I'll stop talking first :)
[00:35:54] <Albright> Basically, with the colon, "self" is implicitly passed as the first parameter to the function
[00:38:12] <Albright> The answer to this question is quite a bit more succinct: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4911186/difference-between-and-in-lua

[01:19:43] <Habbie> a module that prevents many common mistakes

[01:20:06] <Habbie> thus preventing such typos
[01:20:20] <Habbie> depending on what the typo is, of course, i'm assuming a few things here
[01:20:46] <Elw3> Anything trying to prevent me from using globals sucks. I fucking love globals.

[01:37:59] <ubq323> being able to call functions without parentheses is mildly convenient i guess
[01:38:15] <ubq323> and not having to type "function" all the time is also mildly convenient

[02:35:20] <Albright> Some other things but I think that would be the hard part.
[02:35:44] <Albright> Might be fun if this can be done in Lua but I'm open to anything… but I'm still kind of a noob when it comes to desktop application dev.

[02:40:12] <Albright> And support different sizes?
[02:40:32] <technomancy> no idea, just meant it might be worth looking into
[02:40:41] <Albright> Okay, will do.
[02:41:03] <technomancy> but yeah love2d might also be a good contender
[02:41:47] <Elw3> Especially since you can publish this shit as a zip and it runs everywhere.
[02:41:50] <fcr> There's also: https://github.com/lgi-devs/lgi, which might be extremely overkill, but it's is very powerful (you can even create your own custom widgets from the lua side of things)
[02:42:34] <technomancy> Albright: where is the formatted text coming from?
[02:43:03] <Albright> technomancy: The internet, as a Markdown document.
[02:43:27] <Elw3> Do you want the mardown features?
[02:43:55] <technomancy> so not necessarily fully trustworthy, but also not the full onslaught of insanity you could get from raw HTML
[02:43:58] <Albright> Not sure what you mean by "Markdown features." 
[02:44:17] <technomancy> https://github.com/rdlaitila/LURE/ <- might get you a good chunk of what you want
[02:44:31] <technomancy> been meaning to try that out
[02:44:55] <Albright> Hmm, looks basically like Electron, which is not quite what I want
[02:45:14] <Elw3> well having its formating.
[02:51:55] <fcr> Albright: you will probably need to use one of the more powerful toolkits like gtk/qt/wxwidgets
[02:52:12] <fcr> there are bindings for all of them
[02:52:33] <fcr> zerobrane studio for instance uses wxwidgets
[02:52:43] <Elw3> Yea, using qt to display a text. Thats as nice as givnig yourself a headshot.
[02:53:28] <fcr> lgi can be used for gtk (and you don't need a full browser, a "simple" gtk_text_view supports styles and all of that)

[02:57:04] <fcr> Elw3: it's easier than implementing a text render by hand, specially considering that properly done text widgets support external input methods, grapheme clusters, right to left text, etc...
