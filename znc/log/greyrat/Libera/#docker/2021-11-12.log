[01:04:45] <artok> sounds like bug
[01:04:53] <programmerq> arash▸ your user needs to be able to access /var/run/docker.sock to talk to the docker daemon. make sure your user is in the docker group or just run "sudo docker ..." instead of "docker ..."
[01:05:34] <ash_worksi> if a particular program works on a debian:slim container but not alpine (segfault) does that point to anything in particular?
[01:05:36] <programmerq> yeah, usually a segfault means there's a bug in the binary that's running or one of the libraries it links to. you might need to run that same binary against a different userspace.
[01:05:48] *** Joins: nickdiaz1wag209 (~bjpenn_@13.110.54.41)
[01:05:56] <programmerq> ash_worksi since debian:slib is a glibc distro, and alpine is not, there could be a lot of differences.
[01:06:01] <programmerq> is this a statically compiled binary?
[01:06:11] <programmerq> were you the one who compiled it?
[01:06:32] <programmerq> there could be a bug with that problem that gets triggered when it's compiled against libmusl, for example.

[14:11:19] <tabakhase> may be your dns or hoster of the repo
[14:12:01] <mickey8> it's a system time issue, `nslookup` throws nslookup: clock_gettime(MONOTONIC) failed and `apk` throws 4157494160:error:0D0D90AD:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_TIME_adj:error getting time:crypto/asn1/a_time.c:330
[14:12:34] <mickey8> `ping 1.1.1.1` throws the same error as `nslookup`
[14:12:55] <mickey8> so yeah, it might be network related and not clock, but it has nothing to do with google
[14:13:15] <mickey8> also `date` returns "Thu Jan 14 01:57:20 UTC 2106" so there's surely some issue with it
[14:14:09] <tabakhase> uhhhh "error getting time" is the actual error you get :D - i read that "and now its just getting errors"-time - like party-time :D

[14:39:40] <mickey8> it does
[14:40:02] <mickey8> i mean im not very picky about the arch right now, but alpine misbehaves :/

[14:45:51] <ikke> 3.12 should work

[15:16:51] <Epistam> Good afternoon, I'm having trouble setting up Docker networking. I've reduced what I need to work to basically what is described here, but which I can't manage to reproduce : https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-standalone/
[15:17:06] <Epistam> Basically, my containers can communicate among themselves, but not with internet
[15:17:57] <Epistam> You can find my iptables here : https://dpaste.com/A69MV47RL ; docker network ls : https://dpaste.com/A3YNQKS4U ; docker network inspect default_ : https://dpaste.com/GK5QBGPEP
[15:21:12] <Epistam> So TL;DR : bridged networking, either default or user defined doesn't seem to provide connectivity (can't ping anything beyond my laptop's wlan interface IP), and I'm not sure why ; any help will be gladly welcome ! 
[15:23:04] <Epistam> Also, as a heads up : I would like to actually access internet *from* my container, not the other way around / expose a port / service, yada yada

[18:47:21] <programmerq> the first var tells compose to shell out to the docker build cli, and the second tells the docker build cli to use buildkit instead of the old builder.
[18:47:51] <programmerq> Celelibi▸ 'docker cp container:/path /dest' or 'docker export container > container.tar'
[18:49:02] <tabakhase> Celelibi the truth is "its complicated..." - if possible, start the container so it wont fail, then let it fail and investigate while youre in it   ((make it not fail by overwriting entrypoint/cmd to bash, then manually do do the entry/cmd and walk from there))
[18:49:48] <Celelibi> tabakhase, it's not that it fails, but if I re-run it, it will overwrite the file I want. And this file takes quite some time to be generated.
[18:50:51] <programmerq> Furai▸ there's also 'docker buildx bake' which can do the builds in a compose file and it can take a --builder argument so you can explicitly pick the builder.
[18:50:55] <tabakhase> "if you know you want files" progs mentioned "docker cp" is prob right on then yea (say, to copy test results out) -- "explore" sounded more like debugging ;-)
[18:50:57] <Celelibi> But I guess export would work.
[18:51:39] <Celelibi> Well, I said explore because I'm not sure where it is located or even if I actually managed to make it be generated.
[18:51:41] <programmerq> yeah, export just grabs everything on the fs. if you have a specific directory or file path that you are after, then docker cp is handy.

[19:46:23] <arash> can i merge two different images? for example nginx and mysql?
[19:47:32] <tabakhase> arash kinda - does that do what you want? likely absolutely not...
[19:47:34] <programmerq> rawtaz▸ sounds like you want a vulnerability scanner. I've used anchore before-- it can look at any images in a given environment and generate reports about what it found and what vulns there are. they have an open source version
[19:47:51] <tabakhase> arash use docker-compose and multiple containers & networks become a breeze
[19:47:53] <programmerq> arash normally you'd just run a mysql container and an nginx container.
[19:48:18] <lembron> Hi, I am looking for a docker image that I "remember to have seen once a while back" -> a webserver for testing purposes, with ALL sort of "junk" one could request via url -> from filetypes to delays to headers to location: and charset madness + status-codes(404,500...) any pointers? :(
[19:48:22] <programmerq> like you wouldn't want to have both of those pieces of software in the same systemd unit, you'd have two services.
[19:48:46] <Furai> programmerq, so there's no way to create builder in docker compose? I'd have to create it first in correct network and then supply it to the build?
[19:49:03] <programmerq> Furai▸ correct-- compose isn't buildkit aware.
[19:49:48] <Furai> compose v2 neither?
[19:50:01] <Furai> Thank you for your time and help!
[19:50:05] <programmerq> that is my understanding, yes.
[19:50:28] <calm-steam> i cannot make a request from a python script in my container to another container listening, could be an issue with the python package?
[19:51:04] <pycurious> has anyone seen this error: docker.errors.InvalidVersion: device_requests param is not supported in API versions < 1.40
[19:51:08] <tabakhase> calm-steam can you curl/wget/ping it?
[19:51:10] <programmerq> "cannot make a request" -- is it getting connection refused, dns error, timed out? some other error?
[19:51:19] <calm-steam> yes tabakhase 
[19:51:31] <calm-steam> you mean from the container?
[19:51:34] <tabakhase> calm-steam and that is from INSIDE that container right? ;-)
[19:51:44] <tabakhase> (so docker exec)
[19:52:11] <programmerq> pycurious▸ it sounds like you are using an old version of either dockerd or docker cli or you are setting an env var to pin an older API version
[19:52:21] <programmerq> what version of everything are involved, and what command is giving you that error?
[19:52:32] <pycurious> seems like my docker ce and docker-compose versions have a problem
[19:52:32] <calm-steam> ah, it's a python image, it doesn't have anything else tabakhase , should i change to alpine?
[19:52:41] <Furai> I wanted to use buildkit as it seems to be better/faster and has better support for stages in dockerfile, not building the whole thing always. But the problem I'm facing it's that buildkit doesn't support network in the build phase. And one of my dockerfiles is denedant on another network created via docker compose for another service. Oh well.
[19:53:11] <pycurious> programmerq: Docker version 18.09.2, build 6247962 + docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
[19:53:12] <tabakhase> calm-steam you can run another container "in it" with "docker run --rm -it --net container:NAME debian bash"
[19:53:12] <programmerq> Furai▸ it does seem wrong to have a networking dependency like that-- can you share a bit about what that dependency is?

[19:57:57] <tabakhase> arash if you have a hub account, login that doubles the limit - if you have some server somewhere, pull it there and transfer via `ssh debian@mew.com -p 22 "docker save 'IMAGE' | gzip" |  gunzip | docker load` or such :D - if youre at work and this happens ALL the time, get your admin to setup https://docs.docker.com/registry/recipes/mirror/

[20:01:03] <programmerq> pycurious▸ I just followed the repository instructions on that site and 20.10 is what was installed
[20:01:19] <programmerq> so double check you are really using the correct repo and that you don't have the package pinned or marked as hold
[20:01:27] <tabakhase> calm-steam not entirely sure what you mean there... - copypasta what it says - best in a nopaste with your files / comamnds you ran outputs you gotten... --- with debug going checking "with another tool (curl)" to another protocol (ping) to redoing the same on the container you try to reach (services binding to 127.0.0.1 by default is a common trap, should be 0.0.0.0 in dockerland) and go from 
[20:01:28] <tabakhase> there... unless you legit messed up config docker is likely not your fault ;-) (((and for that, wed need to see your config...)))
[20:01:59] <Furai> programmerq, I spin up API, next I spin up fronetend up which during build time has to access this API to get certain data for caching (it's nextjs app). To achieve that I've created proxy-netwok on API which I feed then as external network to the frontend app. If build didn't require that caching step then it would be easier. Also it's only affecting local. On staging/prod it just communicates
[20:02:02] <Furai> with the api over domain which is real one. I had to devise something that works locally on MacOS and Linux.
[20:02:23] <arash> tabakhase, what is this? docker save 'botpress/serve' Cowardly refusing to save to a terminal. Use the -o flag or redirect.
[20:02:26] <Furai> And docker desktop with the VM for linux isn't making stuff easier.
[20:02:50] <tabakhase> Furai  idk nex - but wouldnt you just COPY --from=image to grab em directly? why even bring http in there....

[20:03:53] <programmerq> Furai▸ what sort of data is it caching? I agree that a COPY --from=image (if that data is available as files in another image) would be more ideal.
[20:03:57] <Furai> I wish these were just file.
[20:04:08] <programmerq> could that caching just happen at runtime passively in the background?
[20:04:08] <Furai> It's data from running API
[20:04:25] <programmerq> populating a cache at build time definitely seems weird
[20:04:27] <Furai> That's the point of that cache that it happens during build time. Like static site generation.
[20:04:55] <Furai> Anyway, I'm working with what I'm given and have to solve problems which aren't really problems.

[20:43:29] <tabakhase> what does it do? - schema? -- for static things there should be a magic dbinit.d dir or so that runs any scripts in it during first-boot -- note the FIRST, so this likely wont help you - you want migrations, on an ongoing basis, so likely part of the upstart of your app, not db =)
[20:45:12] <programmerq> calm-steam▸ yeah, see "initializing a fresh instance" here: https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo
[20:45:46] <programmerq> you can make a .sh or .js file in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d and the included entrypoint script will run it when it detects the mongo db hasn't run before.
[20:46:40] <tabakhase> "running two things in one container" is a whole nother forbidden chapter in dockerland ;-) -- and actually not what you want anyhow given your setup-thing "ends" once its done --- so what one usually does is "strap entrypoint scripts infront of things", so start a entry that does migrations infront of your app and perfect is
[20:46:52] <programmerq> if your python script is part of your application, I'd say that logic belongs in the container where your code runs and it should connect to the blank mongodb and run any init/migrations needed.
