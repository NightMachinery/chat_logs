[01:51:37] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: On average, the life cycle of a house fly only lasts for around 30 days, which means they don‚Äôt live for long at all.However, in their short lifetime, they manage to accomplish quite a lot. House flies can lay up to 500 eggs in their lifetime which are usually in batches of around 75 to 150. So, although they don‚Äôt live long, an infestation can quickly arise through new generations.

[01:52:34] <mistiry> lol
[01:52:38] <mistiry> !flyfact
[01:52:38] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Studies show that theres a specific region within the eyes of a male fly called the love spot. It is pretty much used for detecting and chasing female flies. This spot is located within the dorsofrontal region of their eyes. This is typically used to detect small target motion, however, males also use it to stay locked onto potential mates during aerial pursuit.

House flies like the food we eat. When a fly lands on your lunch, it vomits on the food. Acids in the vomit dissolve the food so the fly can suck it up. Disgusting!

[02:38:16] <DrGibby> welcome to a typical chat here
[02:38:49] <MarsSpiral> lol
[02:39:00] <MarsSpiral> how do you reconcile your imposter syndrome with a raise 
[02:40:05] <Kiernian> the thing to remember is that sometimes you're a good fit because, while faking it, you're still managing to actually DO what's required of the job role and perhaps more, while someone else faking it might not get that far.
[02:41:41] <PattyCakes> ^ truth right there
[02:42:05] <PattyCakes> are you getting told you're doing things wrong all the time? Are you actively worried about getting fired because of your screw ups? No?
[02:42:08] <PattyCakes> you deserve a raise
[02:43:54] <MarsSpiral> well
[02:44:08] <MarsSpiral> i just lack self confidence in general and constantly think im incompetent 
[02:44:26] <MarsSpiral> management says im doing a good job and rewards me for it and i feel good maybe for like a week
[02:44:32] <MarsSpiral> then i go back into my old way of thinking
[02:44:51] <Hobadee> MarsSpiral: Well, are you incompetent?
[02:45:09] <MarsSpiral> maybe
[02:45:17] <MarsSpiral> but i guess not cause i got a big raise
[02:45:37] <Hobadee> MarsSpiral: Do you accomplish your assigned tasks within the expected timeframe?
[02:46:03] <MarsSpiral> well the thing about that, we plan our projects by quarter and almost everytime a few projects ends up getting pushed to the next quarter
[02:46:16] <MarsSpiral> everything else sure
[02:46:46] <Hobadee> MarsSpiral: Congratulations!  You aren't incompetent!  If you were incompetent you wouldn't be accomplishing things.
[02:47:06] <Hobadee> MarsSpiral: Now your level of competence is still to be determined, but you aren't incompetent.  :-P
[02:47:11] <MarsSpiral> lol good to get some external validation 
[02:47:21] <MarsSpiral> honestly I like this place, but I'm thinking of leaving for a 99% wfh position. would def lose a decent amount of money tho
[02:48:13] <MarsSpiral> i was actually planning on leaving for sure before i got the raise and bonus and now im not sure.. just waiting on the job offer from the new company
[02:49:21] <MarsSpiral> guess ill just have to weigh how much of a paycut im willing to take for wfh

[08:35:53] <PrincessZoey> we were trying to figure out which was hating which more - docking station or macbook and all of a sudden the 2nd screen came alive (hadn't had a 2nd screen hooked up since I got rid of my hackintosh in 2018) yeahhh https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/5wSfv0b4/cm___bumblebee__beginner_s_luck_by_bakki-dajgb3b.jpg
[08:36:45] <PrincessZoey> I mean it could have been worse but still not a good first impression when you're new lol
[08:37:04] <Kiernian> Ha!
[08:37:24] <misspwn> hah, it would also be unwise with all the memes or images i save if they just started slide show
[08:37:36] <Kiernian> right, THAT is the reason I don't do rotating wallpaper
[08:37:54] <PrincessZoey> I saw the pic and was like "where have I seen this... the hackintosh!" my main screen was mostly appropriate. 
[08:38:09] <PrincessZoey> I just make sure to keep VDI behind whatever I'm screensharing to hide it lol
[08:40:02] <mikespears> omg lmao
[08:41:49] <PrincessZoey> I am totally a professional systems analyst *nods*
[08:41:51] <Kiernian> one place I worked at had the IT department as part of the "tour" for potential clients since we had gigantic wall-mounted monitors with stats on them in the room so being lax about not locking your workstation was...bad.
[08:42:04] <PrincessZoey> how many screens had goatse?
[08:42:49] <Kiernian> we changed over from wallpaper switching to e-mailing the entire IT department from the unlocked workstation to declare "I like turtles". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNry4PE93Y
[08:43:23] <Kiernian> because...yeah, the wallpaper switching got out of hand.
[08:43:31] <Kiernian> and this way, EVERYONE got to see your shame
[08:43:50] <PrincessZoey> god I have so much shit to learn for work.
[08:44:02] <Kiernian> which was highly amusing when I eventually got both the MIS and the CTO
[08:44:09] <PrincessZoey> our "step by step" guide that doesn't have how to do each step is 17 pages x.x
[08:44:16] <sd> 13<J‚Äãay-Ros> we had a sales guy who refused to lock his desktop when he left for the day
[08:44:21] <Cl0udNinja> Kiernian, lmao wedid that too, did we work at the same place?
[08:44:23] <sd> 13<J‚Äãay-Ros> so I rolled over and set it as a unicorn
[08:44:32] <sd> 13<J‚Äãay-Ros> he couldn't work out how to change it back
[08:44:42] <Cl0udNinja> it got put to a stop after someone tried to outdo another person and put a cartoon dickpic
[08:44:43] <xe0n> imagine having a group policy that handles that stuff
[08:44:44] <xe0n> lol
[08:44:59] <Kiernian> It is entirely possible. Oh man, that must have happened after my time. I left that MSP in 2014
[08:45:01] <sd> 13<J‚Äãay-Ros> I mean, I had to remove it from the group policy to get the background to stick
[08:45:07] <csws> smh should've set him to portrait, swapped the left/right click and made the mouse super slow
[08:45:43] <csws> oh and change the browser default search engine to bing
[08:45:44] <sd> 13<J‚Äãay-Ros> nah, a lingering reminder was much more effective and didn't stop him bringing money into the company

[08:46:03] <csws> :(
[08:46:07] <sd> 13<J‚Äãay-Ros> yeah just do a windows update and it does the job for you
[08:46:52] <PrincessZoey> work really needs to fix whatever they fucked up on VDI that makes excel files open in citrix workspace and not excel. or let us be able to change associations and have them stick
[08:47:08] <Kiernian> ohhh.. that's ANNOYING
[08:47:27] <csws> lol
[08:47:45] <csws> I wonder how that even happened
[08:47:46] <PrincessZoey> went to open one today "wait, didn't I change this on Friday?!"
[08:47:47] <Kiernian> can you still have excel open locally, go file-> open and navigate to it?
[08:48:06] <csws> yeah well they're probably tearing down the hosts and rebuilding nightly
[08:48:08] <csws> we do that on horizon
[08:48:16] <PrincessZoey> yeah. can also right click open with excel 
[08:48:31] <PrincessZoey> makes sense, my screenshots in pictures keep disappearing and it's fucking annoying
[08:48:33] <Kiernian> yeah, so just an annoying extra step...but a long one when you forget to do it
[08:48:35] <csws> then again who knows with roaming profiles
[08:48:38] <csws> assuming they actually do that
[08:48:53] <csws> oh man this is exciting
[08:49:02] <csws> MS finally got to the bottom of why our 2008 r2 hosts aren't updating in azure
[08:49:08] <Kiernian> oh?
[08:49:10] <PrincessZoey> if I lose VPN and / or VDI and log back in good chance my photos I need to do my job go *poof*
[08:49:19] <csws> Kiernian, missing certificates causing verification errors with IMDS
[08:49:21] <PrincessZoey> if I didn't copy them out of there

[08:51:05] <csws> it wasn't even something like SQL server either

[08:52:03] <csws> filled with trashy vendor software
[08:52:07] <Kiernian> haha
[08:52:11] <csws> the confusing part is nobody knows who setup the dev environment
[08:52:18] <csws> and I just copied the dev environment when doing test
[08:52:25] <csws> so it's kind of ???? who made the the first mistake
[08:52:25] <csws> oh well
[08:52:35] <Kiernian> "I dunno, we just opened ports 22 and 3389 and one day this server appeared in our infrastructure"
[08:52:41] <csws> I think the vendor did it tbh. which is normally not how they do things here but there was a lot of yolo happening around that project

[08:59:07] <csws> total meltdowns about silly things like where a program is installed, but no care for the fact the vendor just logs in and does shit randomly
[08:59:08] <Kiernian> and yeah, it's absolutely a process thing.
[08:59:26] <csws> i'm just glad this box is patching now

[19:57:55] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> Yeah they always do. Always. Mine were 280GB checkpoint + 1GB avhdx checkpoints + 2GB vhdx from 5 years prior

[19:58:08] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> So it couldn't even merge
[19:58:35] <sd> 13<C‚Äãolour> Because it would try to copy the 280GB ontop of a 1GB avhdx and then it'd max out space and cancel the merge.

[22:48:45] <PattyCakes> A payer is required to issue you a Form W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings if you receive certain gambling winnings or have any gambling winnings subject to federal income tax withholding. You must report all gambling winnings as "Other Income" on Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR (use Schedule 1 (Form 1040) PDF), including winnings that aren't reported on a Form W-2G PDF. When you have gambling winnings, you may be required to pay an estimated tax on
[22:48:45] <PattyCakes>  that additional income. For information on withholding on gambling winnings, refer to Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax.
[22:48:56] <sd> 02<H‚Äãunterkll> the only capital gains involvement would be the difference between when you received it (current price), and when you sold it (sale price)
