[01:19:27] <dan01> Guys
[01:19:33] <dan01> Swear to God
[01:19:42] <dan01> I've that interview I was talking about
[01:19:47] <dan01> For a C# Developer Role
[01:20:09] <dan01> They've offered me a position as a Java 11 Developer.... what the actual hack?
[01:20:20] <jonp> lolwhat?
[01:20:41] <dan01> jonp: Yeah, like a full stack dev, with Java/Spring backend
[01:21:25] <dan01> Still thinking about it... But I mean, it's Java, it's disgusting, right?
[01:21:48] <jonp> it's not *my* favorite…
[01:21:55] <jonp> the real oddity is the "bait and switch"
[01:22:03] <jonp> interviewing for a C# role, and offering a Java role?

[01:22:51] <dan01> ap5: Why do he dislike Java so much?
[01:23:31] <jonp> in this case, it may be less a "dislike Java" and more a "omgwtfbbq interviewing for C# but offering Java…"
[01:23:33] <ap5> dan01, oh. Not because of Java, but because of the bait and switch
[01:23:35] <jonp> i mean, can you *trust* that?
[01:23:41] <jonp> wtf else will they lie about?
[01:23:43] <ap5> Exactly!!
[01:23:58] <dan01> Well, the idea is the project will end soon
[01:24:07] <dan01> So I will only work as a C# dev for some time
[01:24:18] <jonp> the C# project will end soon?
[01:24:23] <dan01> and then they want to bring something simillar in cloud
[01:24:27] <dan01> jonp: yeah
[01:24:39] <dan01> And they said, full-stack because of the cloud thing
[01:24:48] <dan01> btw, it's MicroFocus International

[02:29:37] <JakeSays> Nasp: the stack is so tall it touches the clouds
[02:31:06] <hseg> So I'm adapting one of my classes, and would like (for Join purposes) to have a constructor Derived(Base b, Addtion a) that basically clones b (and then I manually set the remaining fields from a)
[02:31:20] <hseg> is this doable?
[02:32:02] <JakeSays> hseg: yeah
[02:32:24] <JakeSays> just pass b to Base(Base x)
[02:33:31] <hseg> Base doesn't have such a constructor
[02:33:54] <hseg> was hoping there was a standard feature for that
[02:33:56] <JakeSays> hseg: then add one
[02:34:04] <JakeSays> there isn't
[02:34:23] <JakeSays> either add one or have derived initialize base's properties

[02:40:42] <hseg> and ofc, the reason I even need to write a separate adapter is that the DB design is as poor as the code design

[03:11:43] <JakeSays> that walking effect turned out awesome
[03:11:58] <Nasp> This migration project is actually coming along nicely
[03:12:07] <Nasp> But had a meeting the other day that we should also migrate all the stuff we dont use
[03:12:18] <Nasp> "It's easier to just migrate instead of finding out if it's still used"
[03:12:33] <Nasp> And i feel like it's kinda a shame to migrate unused code if it could just be deleted instead
[03:13:32] <JakeSays> Nasp: it's a huge shame
[03:13:36] <JakeSays> expensive as hell
[03:13:39] <Nasp> Yeah
[03:13:46] <Nasp> Since it's debt we are just going to keep
[03:13:53] <JakeSays> yup
[03:13:58] <Nasp> Also i am not sure if people have forgotten my plan is to leave behind all Mvc views
[03:14:12] <Nasp> And people think we just are going to migrate all controllers
[03:14:14] *** Joins: edcba (~edcba@78.193.195.38)
[03:14:31] <Nasp> But since we have been goign the SPA route for last 4-5 years i thought it would be better to not migrate them as well
[03:14:41] <Nasp> And just convert the fucking last part to SPA and avoid this mixed hell
[03:14:48] <Slade> so my school recently got a rep bump, and since then Adobe's been really trying to convince me how awesome Dreamweaver is..
[03:15:45] <Nasp> haha
[03:15:52] <Nasp> That product still exists?
[03:16:12] <Nasp> The 90s called and want their HTML editorback
[03:16:54] <Slade> yea. i'm so confused
[03:17:16] <Nasp> JakeSays: But yeah it kinda depends on what peoples goal are with this migratio
[03:17:20] <JakeSays> Slade: whats a rep bump and why would adobe care
[03:17:31] <Nasp> To just get to use .NET 5 whatever it costs, even though it would add more debt and make it worse
[03:17:40] <Nasp> Or use this oportunity at the same time to improve the codebase
[03:18:27] <Slade> JakeSays, basically additional federal level endorsements abilities.  your tech companies employee the cigarette policy to their products..  'hook them while they're young'
[03:18:43] <Slade> microsoft gives me something like 100,000 license of office for free, same concept
[03:18:58] <JakeSays> ah cool
[03:19:24] <Slade> Apple gives money off all their devices, adobe gives me cheap licenses
[03:19:56] <Nasp> Also what planning software do you use where you work?
[03:20:08] <Nasp> I feel like we are really missing some sort of good kanban software
[03:20:15] <Nasp> Since nobody can figure this out
[03:20:43] <BSaboia> Slade, like being famous. I remember that people gave so much stuff for free for Gisele Bündchen... after she never needed it anymore
[03:21:09] <Slade> i dont know if its appropriate to lump me i the same category as Gisele
[03:21:13] <BSaboia> Nasp, basically everyone uses Jira, hate it or love it
[03:21:29] <Nasp> We have Jira as well and its probably the worst tool
[03:21:39] <Nasp> If we switch to Jira i'd rather go manual kanban

[03:22:21] <BSaboia> I also like Trello
[03:22:32] <Nasp> Yeah it's great but it needs some integrations to work with Git right
[03:22:48] <Nasp> We use 3-4 different tools and it's quite annoying
[03:22:51] <BSaboia> Slade, well, your audience is  #csharp, her's is the world. So perhaps is similar
[03:23:04] <Nasp> I feel like we are missing a "planning" part and a "this is in the pipeline"
[03:23:56] <BSaboia> Nasp, it requires integration, yes. But I think that the more you go to fully-automated, the more it looks like Kira
[03:24:04] <Nasp> Jira is useless
[03:24:06] <Nasp> Can't use it
[03:24:07] <BSaboia> s/Kira/Jira
[03:24:17] <BSaboia> Yeah, I rather use Trello
[03:24:25] <Nasp> Else there's gitlab i think
[03:24:27] <BSaboia> Even if there is this integration
[03:24:30] <Nasp> Which wouldiintegrate more part
[03:24:31] *** Quits: hseg (~hseg@195.192.229.23) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:25:20] <BSaboia> Nasp, so the integration you mean is "PR is merged, pipeline pass tests/build, move kanban ticket to done"?
[03:25:34] <Nasp> Well really only "PR is merged"
[03:25:43] <Nasp> We don't have the other stuff already
[03:25:44] <BSaboia> Then move it to done?
[03:25:47] <Nasp> So yet would probably be move to do
[03:26:01] <Nasp> But problem is getting traction for this
[03:26:06] <BSaboia> I guess that this is somewhat easy to achieve with Gitlab + Trello
[03:26:17] <Nasp> Since we are already using two tools just for issue management is a sign we need a better tool
[03:26:22] <Nasp> Well we don't use Gitlab
[03:26:30] <Nasp> If we used Gitlab it would have those features i think
[03:27:52] <BSaboia> What do you use then?

[11:00:01] <jmer> where ASUS ? and congratulations
[11:00:04] <biberu> congratulations :)
[11:00:11] <jmer> Soul crushing despair?
[11:00:26] <ASUS> I've been practicing coding for a long time, like algorithm and math problems
[11:00:33] <ASUS> so my problem solving skills are good
[11:00:46] <ASUS> just never proper working in a job
[11:00:50] <biberu> don't forget soft skills
[11:00:52] <ASUS> yes
[11:01:00] <biberu> talking to people is probably the most important thing
[11:01:00] <jmer> solving the technical problems is the easy part... Convincing the business side that you shouldn't write shitty code constantly is usually the real challenge
[11:01:06] <ASUS> I have a science degree and an arts degree
[11:01:13] <ASUS> left and right bring
[11:01:15] <ASUS> brain
[11:01:31] <jmer> ASUS: I've met an artist he was even worse in regarsd to communication than business people xD
[11:01:36] <ASUS> I can write long essays and solve physics
[11:01:40] <biberu> jmer :D
[11:01:44] <ASUS> I don't mean fine arts
[11:01:48] <ASUS> I mean like the humanities
[11:01:51] <jmer> No no this wasn't fine arts either
[11:01:57] <jmer> he just went around the world with a camera
[11:02:05] <jmer> and recorded shit
[11:02:08] <jmer> and then it was "video art"
[11:02:14] <biberu> literally shit?
[11:02:24] *** Joins: kilobyte_ch (~kbch@77.109.171.167)
[11:02:27] <ASUS> jmer, Australia
[11:02:28] <biberu> (you never know with artists)
[11:02:32] <jmer> well no but more like... China apparantly built a copy of Paris
[11:02:38] <ASUS> I come from the land down under
[11:02:44] <jmer> but it's so low quality buildings nobody wants to live there so it's abandoned
[11:02:49] <jmer> he recorded that
[11:02:52] <jmer> with a guy walking around the place
[11:02:56] <ASUS> I bloody sprained my foot :(
[11:03:05] <ASUS> it is sooo painful
[11:03:25] <jmer> good thing you aren't using your feet to type :D
[11:03:29] <jmer> ... or are you?
[11:03:32] <ASUS> anyhow, I'm not allowed to use a laptop for work from home
[11:03:39] <ASUS> my boss is scared I will lose the laptop
[11:03:42] <jmer> what
[11:03:44] <ASUS> and then the codebase is leaked
[11:03:45] <jmer> MAJOR red flag
[11:03:56] <ASUS> also
[11:04:05] <jmer> That is easily solved with disk encryption
[11:04:19] <ASUS> he said I will need to install "security" software on my home PC
[11:04:25] <ASUS> I think it's more spying software
[11:04:31] <ASUS> tbh
[11:04:35] <jmer> I refuse working for companies that expect me to use my personal computer
[11:04:49] <biberu> wait, they want you to install that crap on your own pc?
[11:04:51] <ASUS> he said he would give me his old PC
[11:04:58] <jmer> ASUS: find another job ASAP
[11:04:59] <ASUS> so I have my PC I own
[11:05:06] <jmer> major, major red flag
[11:05:07] <ASUS> and his PC next to mine
[11:05:25] <ASUS> and I have to switch monitor
[11:05:32] <ASUS> to the work pc
[11:05:47] <ASUS> he also said he wasn't sure windows 11 would work, he only trusts windows 10
[11:06:22] <jmer> there is no compelling reason to upgrade to win11 so in that sense he is right
[11:06:26] <jmer> but allt he other stuff is just pure BS
[11:06:35] <ASUS> yeah
[11:06:39] <kobo_> meh just boot up a VM ASUS
[11:06:44] <ASUS> I even offered to use my own laptop
[11:06:52] <jmer> You odn't hire wood workers and then tell them "oh, btw you need to bring your own tools because I am afraid you will lose ours when you're out working"
[11:06:53] <ASUS> instead of asking for them to buy one
[11:07:05] <biberu> it's still a good thing to get your foot in the door though :)
[11:07:06] <ASUS> but he said no laptops allowed
[11:07:08] <kobo_> jmer, in US they do :P
[11:07:12] <biberu> but yeah, wouldn't plan to stay for a long time
[11:07:15] <jmer> kobo_: wtf
[11:07:19] <ASUS> yeah
[11:07:26] <ASUS> well, australia and usa are sort of similar
[11:07:37] <ASUS> all our culture is american
[11:07:40] <ASUS> lol
[11:07:48] <kobo_> ASUS, just create a VM and only use that VM when doing work stuff
[11:07:48] <jmer> well it's not so much these issues that is that big of a problem, but it's telling of the general mindset
[11:07:55] <ASUS> yeah
[11:07:58] <jmer> "low trust", "trying to save money where it doesn't make sense" etc
[11:08:07] <ASUS> I told him I would create a different partition
[11:08:13] <ASUS> and install win10
[11:08:19] <ASUS> also
[11:08:22] <jmer> Who's paying for the win10 license?
[11:08:22] <kobo_> jmer, lol... where im at right now we try to save money by only giving us 100gb hard drives
[11:08:29] <kobo_> so I have to use office online, which eats up ram
[11:08:35] <ASUS> I have a win10 licence from university
[11:08:42] <jmer> kobo_: it's so damn short sighted, trying to save on hardware
[11:08:43] <biberu> ASUS: don't use your personal equipment at all
[11:08:51] <jmer> ASUS: "from university" ?
[11:08:51] <kobo_> jmer, yeah I don't get it at all
[11:09:12] <ASUS> I get a CredSSP error when I try and log into remote desktop from windows 11 to windows 10
[11:09:17] <jmer> If it's a special students license I'm fairly sure you're breaking TOS if you're using it after studies ended
[11:09:19] <kobo_> i charge 80usd/hr and they mind giving me a pc for 1k but dont mind me waiting 3hrs/week on builds
[11:09:32] <ASUS> and my boss and I tried to try the fix
[11:09:34] <biberu> first it'll mess with your mind, it's hard to fell off work if you're at home and still in the same setting / using the same tools, and if something needs to get replaced it might get tricky with people like that
[11:09:53] <ASUS> what he wants
[11:10:06] <ASUS> I use my personal PC by remote desktop into his win 10 VM
[11:10:15] <ASUS> and do all my coding in his VM
[11:10:23] <kobo_> ASUS, that's how I work currently too
[11:10:28] <ASUS>  oh
[11:10:28] <jmer> that shouldn't require other software installed on your _PERSONAL_ PC
[11:10:35] <ASUS> I think
[11:10:39] <ASUS> if I use remote desktop
[11:10:44] <ASUS> the spyware will be installed on the VM
[11:10:47] <kobo_> jmer, well they might use Citrixor such
[11:10:51] <kobo_> Citrix or such
[11:10:53] <ASUS> so my boss can monitor me
[11:10:59] <biberu> no one has ever asked me to install spyware over here
[11:11:02] * jmer gets the shivers
[11:11:05] <biberu> is that a thing in .dk jmer?
[11:11:07] <ASUS> he said
[11:11:11] <kobo_> But is it really "spyware"
[11:11:13] <ASUS> if he lends me his old PC
[11:11:16] <jmer> ASUS: don't stop seeking jobs.
[11:11:20] <ASUS> it will have "security" software
[11:11:25] <ASUS> i think he is lying
[11:11:35] <ASUS> he says he needs to collect "security logs"
[11:11:47] <jmer> He's so full of shit he might as well be a septic tank
[11:11:54] <kobo_> I don't think it's such a red flag as you guys think
[11:12:05] <ASUS> I played dumb and pretended to believe him
[11:12:10] <jmer> kobo_: you're freelancing
[11:12:11] <jmer> it's different
[11:12:28] <ASUS> if I said to him, "it's spyware" it would create a problem
[11:12:29] <jmer> you get paid more to suffer this BS
[11:12:42] <kobo_> but I mean don't all office PCs have their security stuff on them
[11:12:50] <kobo_> 3x "antivirus" tools ec
[11:12:51] <jmer> Sure but then it's an OFFICE pc
[11:12:57] <ASUS> yeah
[11:12:58] <ASUS> anyhow
[11:12:59] <jmer> only for work
[11:13:06] <ASUS> for the next month, I can use remote desktop
[11:13:08] <jmer> now ASUS will get his phub browsing logged in the company systems
[11:13:10] <kobo_> jmer, oh I interpreted it that the work pc would have the software
[11:13:22] <ASUS> actually
[11:13:26] <kobo_> and that he just needed some RDP on his own pc
[11:13:27] <ASUS> if I use remote desktop
[11:13:31] <ASUS> I don't need the spyware
[11:13:39] <ASUS> only if I work locally
[11:13:42] <ASUS> I need to use spyware
[11:13:47] <jmer> at the very least you will need a VPN client
[11:13:47] <ASUS> on a different PC
[11:13:55] <kobo_> jmer, put that inside the VM
[11:13:57] <ASUS> nope
[11:14:04] <ASUS> I don't think we are using VPN
[11:14:09] <ASUS> just play remote desktop
[11:14:13] <ASUS> plain*
[11:14:15] <jmer> kobo_: I'm fairly sure that using a VM will require a double windows license.
[11:14:20] <jmer> WHo pays for that?
[11:14:24] <jmer> ASUS: WHAT
[11:14:33] <kobo_> jmer, kmspico pays for that
[11:14:42] <jmer> nobody who knows their stuff opens RDP to the public
[11:14:48] <ASUS> oh
[11:14:52] <jmer> it's like instant bruteforce from shady IP ranges
[11:15:02] <ASUS> he controls access to RDP with the firewall
[11:15:10] <ASUS> IP rules
[11:15:12] <jmer> that doesn't matter asus
[11:15:19] <jmer> You can spoof an IP quite easily
[11:15:27] <ASUS> I guess
[11:15:30] <ASUS> well
[11:15:38] <ASUS> he probably isn't the smartest cookie then
[11:15:39] <ASUS> my boss
[11:15:49] <ASUS> (he does live in a low socio-economic area)
[11:15:50] <jmer> we accidentally opened RDP publicly at one of my former work places
[11:16:02] <ASUS> my iPhone told me his suburb
[11:16:04] <jmer> and in minutes our logs was flooded with login attempts
[11:16:06] <ASUS> he lives in a poor area
[11:16:33] <ASUS> if he is my boss why is he living in crapville

[11:17:54] <jmer> I lived in what you would considder a "low income" apartment for many years after I finished studying
[11:17:59] <ASUS> I mean some people live in poorer areas if they want to afford to have a family
[11:18:18] <ASUS> having a multi bedroom house in a nice area is so expensive these days
[11:18:26] <ASUS> if you want a family you have to compromise

[11:19:03] <ASUS> yeah
[11:19:07] <ASUS> my cousin has a family

[11:22:41] <ASUS> is all you need
[11:22:43] <jmer> THey are tools with a specific purpose
[11:23:11] <ASUS> I mean, C is good, but it requires so much more code
[11:23:13] <jmer> well that's not a wrong statement but I think it will be alot slower writing line of business apps in C than c#
[11:23:31] <ASUS> C is more suited to low level coding

[11:53:47] <ASUS> "security logs"
[11:53:53] <khanred> hm
[11:53:54] <ASUS> seems like spyware more likely
[11:54:00] <jmer> that it's old hardware is less of a red flag than them expecting you to use your own hardware

[11:56:00] <ASUS> I'm not allowed to have a laptop, even if they provide it

[12:21:58] <MatthiasVance> LOTS of money

[12:22:09] <khanred> It's like dick sizes
[12:22:10] <MatthiasVance> kobo_: Indeed
[12:22:15] <Nasp> Even though a coca-cola is expensive, if you go to a petrol station it's still cheaper to drink gasoline than coke
[12:22:17] <khanred> except smaller is better...
[12:22:24] <jmer> khanred: are you often in situations where dicks are compared? xD
[12:22:30] <khanred> jmer, yes
[12:22:34] <kobo_> I mean my income tax rate is not really that high. but consider if I bill 80 usd, first its like 35% that just vanishes, then 35% on top of that in income tax, and then 25% VAT on anything i buy
[12:22:47] <kobo_> oh and vat on the 80 usd too
[12:22:58] <jmer> you have company tax at 35%?
[12:23:06] <irwiss> MatthiasVance: where is that not true? :D > "unless you have lots of money"
[12:23:10] <jmer> or is that the cut you give to the freelancer agency?

[12:24:10] <kobo_> so i bill 100usd/hr, 20 of that is vat. then I want that 80 usd as salary, then i pay 31.42% in employment fee. then of whats left, i pay income tax 30-50% depending on salary.
[12:24:47] <kobo_> then if I decide to buy a bottle of wine, that'd be taxed 25% vat, and also include alchol taxes as well
[12:25:17] <kobo_> which is like 3 usd / litre of wine

[15:03:27] <MatthiasVance> O
[15:03:29] <jmer> but this couldn't have been fixed by a code review
[15:03:33] <MatthiasVance> why not?

[15:03:38] *** Joins: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien)
[15:03:51] <MatthiasVance> yes of course
[15:04:00] <jmer> because he basically took a simple console app that reads data from a file andputs it into a database and made it into this overengineered piece of shit xD
[15:04:05] <MatthiasVance> I guess the entire team is to blame :D
[15:04:09] <MatthiasVance> If they allow that behavior
[15:04:20] <MatthiasVance> Or rather, have something to learn
[15:04:22] <jmer> I think it blindsided them that he did not put it into prod

[15:04:41] <jmer> it changes very rarely and it's ... super simple
[15:04:54] <jmer> I am ofc. insisiting that we pipeline the shit outta this so it's deployed together with the rest of the system.
[15:05:22] <MatthiasVance> One problem that you always have with manual deploys is that at some point you forget what is running where :D

[15:06:46] <MatthiasVance> that sucks
[15:07:01] <MatthiasVance> Ever since I switched tasks I am having better days :D
[15:07:02] <jmer> I managed to git reset --hard my work
[15:07:13] <jmer> because git changed to another branch when I did a reboot (I've never seen this happen before)
[15:08:07] <canton7> Given that the currently-checked-out branch is just stored in a file, sounds like an OS/disk thing?
[15:09:05] <jmer> canton7: yeeaaah I got that warning about some programs blocking for the reboot and I just clicked the "whatever, reboot bitch" button xD
[15:09:33] <jmer> and I had just git reset a branch with some extra logging code which was OK to throw away... so my mind thought "oh yeah I have to redo this after the reboot" and I totally frogot that I had popped my stash
[15:09:39] <jmer> So it IS my fault
[15:09:42] <jmer> but I prefer to blame git

[15:14:34] <canton7> jmer, right, but stashes *are* commits -- they just don't have a branch pointing at them
[15:15:27] <canton7> It's an impl detail -- it's just how git stores the stash. But it means the steps to recover a lost commit also apply to the commits which git created to store a stash
[15:15:33] <canton7> (apart from the reflog, annoyingly)

[15:17:59] <MatthiasVance> eurogos: At least you won't have to assembly a PC.. or were you going for a laptop anyway?

[15:18:34] <MatthiasVance> Ah nice
[15:18:40] <eurogos> pc is old though
[15:18:51] <eurogos> actually macbook is old too
[15:19:08] <MatthiasVance> I have my main PC that runs everything and is powerful and a laptop from work that I use as a thin client for that
[15:19:19] <MatthiasVance> So when I'm away .. idk .. I use VPN but I have no solution to have 2 devices lol
[15:19:29] <MatthiasVance> All those settings
[15:20:10] <eurogos> maybe i'll wait till gfx cards are reasonable again
[15:20:50] <jmer> eurogos: didn't AMD release (or at least mention) a new card time that was purposely bad at mining tasks?
[15:21:15] <MatthiasVance> nvidia too
[15:21:45] <eurogos> i'm one of those idiots that buys stuff way more powerful than they actually need
[15:22:53] <jmer> eurogos: I mean... my relatively OK gfx card can still be punched below 60FPS with Project Zomboid
[15:23:19] <jmer> and it's not exactly a "AAA graphics" game
[15:23:52] <irwiss> to be fair zomboid has one of the shittiest engines
[15:24:46] <jmer> irwiss: the point I failed to make was, that sometimes you need more power than  you expect if you want to run shittily written indie games xD
[15:25:21] <eurogos> but probably an epyc cpu is overkill ;)
[15:25:26] <irwiss> yea but lets be real there's always gonna be that N+1 game that's even shittier and will need more resources :P
[15:25:54] <jmer> irwiss: yeah I played ARK when it was still in early access and oculd barely run it at 30FPS with a decent computer xD
[15:25:58] <irwiss> and zomboid is like N+800, cause a laptop that ran overwatch at 60fps had the cpu throttle from heat when running zomboid XD
[15:26:22] <irwiss> jvm is just that shitty for games
[15:26:24] <MatthiasVance> I have a 1080 and for everything else a 3080 in the cloud :D

[15:26:52] <eurogos> 980Ti xD
[15:26:57] <irwiss> i got a 3060 ti like 6 months ago in the price dip, chugging along pretty well, unlikely to replace it until next-next console gen
[15:27:13] <jmer> eurogos: I gave away my old 980TI to a friend, he still uses it and says it runs God of War flawlessly
[15:27:25] <irwiss> a 680 lasted me almost 10 years... cause consoles practically cockblock any serious graphics improvements on pc
[15:27:33] <jmer> irwiss: yes :(
[15:27:40] <MatthiasVance> irwiss: Really? I thought they would just downport it?
[15:27:54] <irwiss> what do you mean?
[15:28:22] <MatthiasVance> Like they would make a great game for PC but then for consoles they would use shittier graphics :D
[15:28:35] <jmer> MatthiasVance: not everything can be downgraded...
[15:28:50] <jmer> Just look at the Witcher 3 on the Switch xD
[15:29:04] <jmer> or basically any modern port on the switch
[15:29:28] <irwiss> MatthiasVance: nope, the dev kits usually prevent you from making a "great game on PC" and then port it to console
[15:30:41] <eurogos> so I read that you can run dotnet on the switch like monogame or something
[15:30:47] <eurogos> how do you deploy it?
[15:31:52] <irwiss> MatthiasVance: especially for something like ps3 which had completely different arch... which is the reason why usually low effort console ports are so shit - the controls are usually halfassed, graphics look like it's the 00s even though you have 8gb vram, there's LONG ASS corridors you need to travel through hidden as "clever" design but it's in
[15:31:52] <irwiss> fact the areas where consoles get their shit together to load up from their slow ass HDD

[15:34:05] <irwiss> jmer: then you get other games like fo4 where if you run at superhigh fps you get faster loading times because bethesda's shitty engine from the 90ies is just that retarded :P
[15:34:44] <irwiss> jmer: and i don't mean actually run the game at high fps... just the loading screens... because naturally you tie your render loop to your disk asset loading loop :D
[15:34:50] <jmer> irwiss: I hate Bethesda for keeping that engine around for so long... At least I hope their space thing will be a lot better
[15:35:04] <irwiss> nah it'll be oblivion with guns, in space... like fallout
[15:35:30] <jmer> irwiss: if I can't fly a space shop to another planet that game will have lost my interested even before I start playing it.

[15:37:06] <jmer> I read an article stating it was because of how they did pathfinding
[15:39:05] <irwiss> iirc their engine has static pathfinding baked into levels... so you can't change the map at runtime in any way, just barely tinker with it using stuff like skse which basically intercepted function calls to actually do useful stuff for modding, and fix bugs left by bethesda
[15:39:43] <irwiss> also the pathfinding is stupid af, any melee enemy you can literally cheese by jumping up and down a rock cause the AI will walk around it... cmon >_>

[15:41:50] <irwiss> yeah morrowind spells were bonkers broken if you tried, but also fun af :P
[15:42:04] <jmer> it's a single player game it doesn't matter if it's OP or broken
[15:42:54] <irwiss> yep, totally agree... altho i'm like 90% sure the next bethesda game will have online only drm thingy that'll make it non-single player
[15:43:01] <irwiss> easier to milk

[18:14:32] <irwiss> probably extra practice for the orchestra, a little budget and there we go :P
[18:15:45] <xb0o2> hseg: no way :o
[18:16:01] <jmer> irwiss: well sure, but at some point someone have had to have said "All right guys, let's do Kyle's mom is a bitch next"
[18:16:06] <xb0o2> I think I might cry.
[18:18:04] <hseg> the feeling of causing change is great, isn't it?
[18:18:19] <hseg> especially with me having been so stubborn
[18:24:26] <irwiss> i'd consider a simple loop instead of aggregate, not everything has to be linq oneliners
[18:26:50] <xb0o2> I'd imagine for any reasonable performance you're going to be memoising values anyway
[18:27:06] <xb0o2> So you might as well make it an obviously imperative loop
[18:27:12] <ap5> I love simple loops
[18:27:39] <xb0o2> Unless you love functional code and have no concerns over performance in which case you could probably express it quite elegantly
[18:28:06] <irwiss> i mean you can make aggregate take list{x0} for initial value, f(list[-1], xi) for next... it'll just be butt ugl
[18:28:08] <irwiss> ugly*
[18:28:43] <xb0o2> Yeah you'd just end up with an imperative LINQ Frankenmonster
[18:29:23] <irwiss> not sure it'll reach n^2 tbh, unless f() is described weirdly
[18:29:52] <xb0o2> Well without the memoisation it would?
[18:30:09] <biberu> you don't need to memoize that
[18:30:22] <irwiss> yea but without memoisation you don't need aggregate
[18:30:25] <biberu> you can just call f with the previous value, next value
[18:31:20] <irwiss> the final result needs all previous results too... so you'll need to remember all results anyway... might as well just make a simple loop
[18:31:38] <irwiss> the final resulting array i mean, as described
[18:31:43] <xb0o2> Yeah.
[18:31:54] <biberu> could just implement it as a generator too

[18:43:04] <irwiss> biberu: the function yes, but scroll up, hseg asking for the entire sequence, not just the last member
[18:45:14] <biberu> sure, but he can still generate it while only keeping the last output (the tail of the seq so far)

[21:40:14] <hseg> and it's not like the class and the interface share member names
[21:41:12] <irwiss> 'as' never complains, it just returns null if cast is invalid, do c style cast and it'll raise exception
[21:41:27] <xb0o2> It's valid because there may be a subtype of C that implements I.
[21:41:51] <hseg> huh, ok
[21:42:19] <xb0o2> If you seal C, then there's no subtypes, so the compiler will provide the error.
[21:42:34] <xb0o2> (Not saying you should, just saying the compiler is aware)
[21:43:14] <xb0o2> And yeah, just be aware that `(I)a` will fail if a does not implement I but `a as I` will evaluate to null.
[21:43:19] <hseg> wait, why would a subtype implementing I mean I can cast C to I?
[21:43:21] <xb0o2> As irwiss just pointed out
[21:44:42] <xb0o2> Because the instance being talked about at the time of casting may well implement I

[21:51:13] <hseg> Ah -- you're saying that my List<C> might actually contain a mix of SubC's and NonISubC's, and my Select(a => a as I) will convert those it can and replace the rest with null?

[21:51:59] <hseg> and that if I do C-style casts I wll get an exception instead?

[21:52:48] <hseg> ok, til
[21:54:05] <xb0o2> May be helpful to think of it not as a collection containing Cs, just as a list of things of any type that inherit from C.
