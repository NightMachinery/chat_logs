[22:06:49] <sublim20> man
[22:07:10] <sublim20> its officially a week now since last having nicotine
[22:07:25] <sublim20> anyone trying to quit smoking / nicotine, seriously, try nicotine pouches.  
[22:07:40] <sublim20> by far the easiest form of nicotine i've ever tried quitting
[22:07:40] <nativetexan> dip pouches?
[22:07:47] <sublim20> there's a few different types
[22:07:52] <sublim20> there are 'dip pouches'
[22:08:01] <sublim20> but theres also just straight nicotine pouches
[22:08:04] <sublim20> the differences is confusing
[22:09:00] <Panther> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5x-KjBME_E
[22:09:00] <sublim20> for example, theres snus, which is probably what you're referring to as 'dip pouches', and then theres nicotine pouches.  the difference being wether the material / nicotine is synthetic or not
[22:09:03] <Janet> ^ (LISTEN TO THIS EVERY DAY) Earl Nightingale - The Strangest Secret (FULL) - Patrick Tugwell - YouTube
[22:09:25] <nativetexan> ah
[22:09:46] <sublim20> its absurdly confusing
[22:10:18] <sublim20> it gets even worse, cause they label the products by the amount of nicotine.  however, the amount of nicotine is NOT the amount of nicotine that can be released / absorbed.  
[22:10:23] <nativetexan> men don't think?....already don't like this video
[22:10:54] <sublim20> so you end up with situations where a 6mg hits less than a 4mg from a different manufacturer

[23:53:09] <DOMF> that's abuse
[23:53:18] <piercedwater> nah i emptied it about 5-6 times a day
[23:53:22] <DOMF> you should have N+1 boxen
[23:53:28] <piercedwater> they were well taken care of
[23:53:29] <DOMF> doesn't matter how many times you empty it
[23:53:33] <DOMF> cats are very territorial
[23:53:38] <DOMF> they like to have their OWN
[23:53:58] <piercedwater> well it worked
[23:54:55] <artao> depends on the cat
[23:55:09] <artao> "the rule" is to have 1.5 litter boxes per cat
[23:56:46] <artao> as such, i really should get one more litter box
[23:56:51] <artao> and clean the two i have
[23:56:59] <piercedwater> what kind of litter do you use
[23:57:11] <piercedwater> jw
[23:57:14] <artao> tidy cat light weight
[23:57:18] <piercedwater> i think we used arm & hammer

[23:58:19] <piercedwater> nice, the really cheap stuff is horrible about that i think
[23:58:30] <piercedwater> clumps everywhere they walk ;(
[23:58:37] <piercedwater> can't have kitties livin like that
[23:58:59] <piercedwater> nothing but the best for pets!
