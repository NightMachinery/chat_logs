[00:18:30] <Dagmar> You need to chop the salt off the ciphertext and pass it to openssl along with the plaintext password.

[01:54:05] <Saito552> the speaker/mic port thing was one of the easier things
[01:54:24] <stasp> I've actually decided not to use manjaro anymore, few reasons beeing working TUI installer and espeakup support in the official iso so no need to use talking arch.

[01:55:29] <Saito552> but for me still only being around a few years manjaro might still be for me
[01:55:35] <tinyweasel> so, maybe a bit off-topic, but what's a good way to reach an uptime of 10 years? I have a UPS and all, but accidents behind my server rack are too common, but generally, I'd only knock out the network for a few minutes

[01:56:01] <tinyweasel> but I did think about it, and in 10 years time, my servers would be nearing 20
[01:56:27] <tinyweasel> ideally, I'd want to stay on the same v4 kernel and all
[01:56:55] <f843d0> tinyweasel: maybe is just me, but... what is the *real* question?
[01:57:01] <tinyweasel> hmm
[01:57:11] <nomagno> tinyweasel: is 'accidents behind your server rack' an idiom or are people bumping against it/breaking it with a hammer all the time?
[01:57:38] <tinyweasel> oh, I go and plug in an ethernet cable, and I generally will just unplug the switch accidentally
[01:57:51] <tinyweasel> so, no, it's not an idiom
[01:58:41] <f843d0> tinyweasel: very well, you unplug cables and switches, so something gets offline... How does it relate with 10 years uptime?
[01:58:48] <tinyweasel> oh, hmm
[01:58:52] <nomagno> Yeah I think the only think separating you from datacenter-level reliability is being less clumsy

[02:15:28] <LordDragon> or you can force it to be at its maximum turbo 100% of the time

[03:41:53] <rascul> kubuntu is the same as ubuntu, just it has kubuntu-desktop installed by default instead of ubuntu-desktop

[08:26:02] *** Joins: NaTaSa21F (~KELEBEK@95.70.207.169)
[08:26:04] <jim> ok, some folks don't really like writing shell scripts, because it's kinda difficult, and then when you have to read the script again, that can be hard too
[08:26:08] <jim> so,
[08:26:22] <Gustavo6046> it seems like the issue was substituting dbus.service for dbus-broker.service, however, whenever I insert my password to login or to authenticate virt-manager or even 'systemctl restart NetworkManager', it takes an eternity to... I dunno, load up or something?
[08:26:33] *** Joins: betelgeuse (~betelgeus@94-225-47-8.access.telenet.be)
[08:26:48] <jim> I suggest you learn a -non- shell scripting language (examples of those, perl, python, lua, many others)
[08:26:59] <Gustavo6046> perl came to your mind before python?

[08:42:49] <iblackou1s> to use the terminal*
[08:43:23] <Gustavo6046> I think it should be like, two LRU trees, one for code and one for general data, and the code one would be split into active and inactive

[08:44:12] <Gustavo6046> once a library is unloaded, its LRU entry is marked as inactive
[08:44:18] <Gustavo6046> if the least recently used entry of the LRU tree is active, but there are inactive entries around, it is preferred to replace those
[08:44:45] *** Joins: Sauvin (~sauvin@about/linux/staff/sauvin)
[08:45:02] <Gustavo6046> if there are no inactive entries in the tree, entries that would otherwise be reserved for data files will start to be used for this

[08:45:48] <Gustavo6046> the way to do this is simple; since a LRU tree is a binary tree, you can specify whether there is a program or a data entry to the left or to the right of a node

[08:49:42] <Gustavo6046> so when adding a new data entry, you will only follow the LRU path along edges that are marked as leading to data file entries
[08:49:49] *** Joins: ThanatosJ (~Thanatos@105.112.41.209)
[08:50:14] <Gustavo6046> so say, a node has a data file entry to the left and a program file entry to the right, and it's the LRU path, but you wanna add a data file, so even if the program file is the one that is LRU, that edge is not marked as leading to a data file (bottom level edges are never marked as leading to both, for obvious reasons), so you instead follow the opposite edge

[08:51:58] <Gustavo6046> you may expect to never reach situations in which you're in a bottom node that leads to two entries where neither is the type you want, because that implies that the edge above that node is also only marked with that type, so you'd never follow that edge to begin with

[08:54:42] *** Quits: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[08:54:49] <Gustavo6046> this way, if you have a tree with 256 (0x100) entries allocated, the first 64 (0x40) of which are for programs and the remaining 192 (0xC0) are for data, and let's say all of the program file entries are occupied except one is inactive, you can follow the LRU path pertinent to inactive program entries
[08:55:40] <Gustavo6046> if there are no inactive program entries, neither of the edges from the root node will have the "(can lead to) 'inactive program file' type entry" flag set, so it will fallback to replacing the LRU data file entry
[08:55:48] <Gustavo6046> this is all btw what I thought could be done for the file cache in memory/swap

[12:39:08] <rahl> not sure where best to ask this. have got an `echo $$?` in a `Makefile` to output the return value of a test run. But it becomes the return value of `make` itself thus gets displayed like this: `make: *** [Makefile:#: test] Error <echo'd val>`

[12:43:06] <rahl> DPA: well, testing with more `echo`s, I now realise the `echo` is not the problem
[12:43:24] <lopid> probably not, just a possible workaround
[12:43:51] <rahl> my "test" case just runs the compiled executable - and it's its return val that raises the error (which kinda makes sense)

[12:44:17] <rahl> the recipe was simply `./executable && echo $$?`

[12:46:23] <lopid> in a shell script, yes, but a makefile isn't a shell script
[12:46:24] <Blondie101010> rahl:  2 things wrong with that command: a) if ./executable returns 0, there won't be an echo; b); $$? will output the PID

[13:17:10] <davidsong> Hi. I've got a compliance rule that says:  "machine or device control programs (software that operates the machine or device’s functions) shall test for possible corruption caused by failure of the program storage medium and all critical files"
[13:17:47] <davidsong> is there a way to solve this with the right choice of filesystem?

[13:18:32] <lopid> a filesystem that can't become corrupt?
[13:19:05] <p`> journalling (any modern fs) probably takes care of a lot of that, but ECC memory could be read as a requirement there too

[13:19:18] <deniska> davidsong: I'd guess you should consult someone specializing in that, but I feel it means something along the lines of "pull the storage media out and toss it in a fire. How easy is it to get the program going again?"
[13:19:55] <nomagno> Well ZFS is an option
[13:19:59] <p`> i don't want to give too much advice on compliance tho, who ever knows with that stuff?  could mean a lot of different things to different people.
[13:20:22] <deniska> It probably means having proper backup and (almost more importantly) restore procedures in place
[13:20:52] <davidsong> to add a bit of context, it's for slot machines

[17:50:37] <Dagmar> I worked at a PC repair shop once where the owner's husband was former military, so he _got_ the service manuals for everything

[17:51:54] <Dagmar> That was mainly becuase it radically speeds things along with printers... PCs not so much.
[17:51:59] <lericson> no decent car mechanic is following a step-by-step instruction when they diagnose a car, that's just not possible - you know how the thing should work, you look out for oddities, you try to come up with theories and disprove them

[17:52:23] <Dagmar> lericson: At dealerships they're generally going to have access to a service manual for each and every model
[17:52:53] <Dagmar> ...which is why dealership repair shops can cost more, but they will generally get it right the very first time
[17:52:59] <lericson> and dealerships are well known for being unable to fix anything but a simple R&R :p

[19:53:46] <ayecee> what that will tell me is that the cronjob is working, that there was an error in running the script, and the error was discarded because your line doesn't capture that
[19:54:11] <ayecee> to capture that, add 2>&1 between update.sh and |

[23:52:43] <boblamont> Pentium iMac running Lubuntu 12.10. Had problem that drive was full so it wouldn't boot. Somewhere along the way, the desktop manager, LDM, was removed so it gets stuck at fsck line on boot. It also can't connect to the network, seems to be DNS related. Otherwise still running cron jobs if left on. Not mine, trying to restore desktop and networking. What do I need to do?

[23:56:56] <gmcastil> I'm running Ubuntu 16 in a Virtualbox setting under Ubuntu 20 and the machine is aborting when I attempt to do large amounts of disk access - i'm a bit stuck and unsure as to where to find logs that might contain information of interest.
[23:56:56] *** Quits: Telvana (~capo@user/telvana) (Client Quit)
[23:57:05] <gmcastil> I've looked in /var/log/syslog

[23:57:59] <ayecee> if you don't normally look in there, it'll be hard to tell what's unusual
[23:58:05] <gmcastil> there are a few things that grepping for -i error pops with, but nothing that screams disk access
[23:58:16] <ayecee> don't use grep. use eyeballs.
[23:58:22] <ayecee> grep is good for looking for things you know are there

[23:59:01] <gmcastil> is that the best log to look in?
[23:59:05] <ayecee> cutting down the time period will reduce it from zillions to maybe a couple hundred
[23:59:11] <gmcastil> its about 2k

[23:59:41] <gmcastil> right before i start the process that aborts the guest
