[01:00:08] <artao> can you imagin zero g sex?
[01:00:16] <s98259> There would need to be health and safety assessments involved first.

[01:00:30] <artao> nah :P
[01:00:46] <s98259> It's hard enough getting astranauts up there, they require a LOT of training but that doesn't mean tourism can't be done.
[01:01:07] <s98259> And it would pay big money too.
[01:01:33] <artao> to operate the equipment they require training

[01:34:25] <murthy> Actually vpn inside vm :)

[01:35:18] <morlog> hey there
[01:35:49] <murthy> Ya vm leaks
[01:35:51] <morlog> you should read up on the security risks of using a vm
[01:35:59] <murthy> I know

[01:37:43] <morlog> yeah
[01:38:56] <murthy> s98259: I know, I do a lot of stuff in the background. For risky stuff I use a clone of a vm and destroy. I usually use TAILS for extreme risks
[01:39:14] <s98259> :)
[01:39:27] <murthy> :)
[01:39:41] <morlog> your better off running tails off a flash drive in a liveboot than you are in a vm

[03:17:21] <murthy> ya
[03:17:27] <murthy> I do think so

[03:18:51] <hype> murthy Thanks.
[03:22:53] <artao> FUCK man! .. This joystick is "Buy It Now" $150usd free shipping. .. It's been up long enuf that the seller added "Make an offer" ... I'm @ $130 now and like ... c'mon eh? 
[03:23:01] <artao> or i may as well just pull the trigger
[03:23:02] <artao> hehe
[03:23:11] <artao> pun intended. .. pretty loose pun
[03:23:20] <artao> ..... that's what she said
[03:24:30] <artao> Thrustmaster T.16000M HOTAS set
[03:24:52] <artao> it was designed in conjunction with Elite Dangerous .. which is what i'm currently playing
[03:25:14] <artao> but it's also awesome in other flying games. sooo many axisessez
[03:25:17] <artao> axes
[03:25:29] <artao> and buttons
[03:26:58] <artao> The plural of axis is axes or axises.
[03:27:01] <artao> well okay then
[03:27:13] <artao> I'll go with axises. 
[03:28:13] <artao> it has like 8 axises
[03:29:23] <artao> joystick has pitch, roll, yaw, and throttle slider. throttle attachment has throttle, yaw, and several assignable axises
[03:29:34] <artao> for adjusting things like scan range
[03:30:34] <artao> the yaw on the throttle will be sweet, cuz on joystick you have to twist it, which is awkward and eventually uncomfortable. on the gamepad it's akay, but has to be done useing both joysticks or one stick plus the triggers
[03:31:05] <artao> not intuitive. easy to get messed up and properly coordinate yaw/pitch/roll in turns. particularly long turns
[03:33:21] <artao> the throttle attachment has a rotary single-axis next to the pinky. In propeller plane sims like IL-2 Sturmovik i could use that to control propeller pitch
[03:33:46] *** Joins: ChromaCat248 (~ChromaCat@user/chromacat248)
[03:33:57] <artao> which is important to adjust along with the throttle to maintain stay in the best RPM range
[03:34:50] <artao> some ww2 planes even let you fully feather the propellers for steel diving
[03:35:09] <artao> </rant>
[03:35:10] <artao> sry
[03:35:17] <artao> i'll (try to) stop

[03:35:45] <TXDillo> The Constellation could feather it's props in reverse for quick stops
[03:35:59] <artao> i'm not fami ... wait

[03:36:21] <TXDillo> no a passgenger/eqpt transport
[03:36:28] <TXDillo> was used by Howard Hughes
[03:36:28] <artao> no wait, that's Constitution ain't it
[03:36:32] <morlog> most modern prop planes can nowadays
[03:36:34] <TXDillo> for his airline
[03:36:34] <artao> AH
[03:36:39] <artao> good ol' hughes
[03:36:55] <morlog> change the pitch of the props
[03:37:01] <artao> well nowadays most modern prop planes have jet engines
[03:37:01] <artao> hehe
[03:37:06] <TXDillo> The Constellation was the first airliner to offer cabin compression for commercial service
[03:37:16] <artao> but no. yeah

[03:37:53] <artao> it's so cool how detailed flight sims are these days
[03:37:56] <artao> including space
[03:38:10] <artao> the spaceships in Elite Dnagerous can actually be pretty complex

[05:05:52] <buZz> TXDillo: how do you like my weird french song
[05:09:51] <macrobat> 7/8 is normal
[05:13:53] <artao> WOOT just bobught the joystick \o/ 
[05:14:02] <artao> Thrustmaster T.1600M HOTAS
[05:15:41] <artao> $150
[05:15:50] <macrobat> my mouse is dumb and plain, so that I won't game

[05:17:18] <macrobat> for $250, I could buy another guitar, but then I'd have too many :/
[05:17:42] <artao> NEVER
[05:17:47] <artao> is that even possible?
[05:18:00] <artao> are you actually a REAL guitarist or just some string yanking poseur?
[05:18:02] <artao> hehe :P
[05:18:14] <artao> 250 wouldn't be much of a guitar tho to be honest
[05:18:28] <artao> now, a synthesizer?
[05:18:29] <artao> yeah
[05:18:37] <macrobat> more than some I already have
[05:18:47] <macrobat> find the meter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfLE9K5ONQY

[05:19:15] <artao> volca sample, nts-1, craftsynth, neutron
[05:19:17] <TomatoSynn> my brother has like 10 guitars like that, i always ask him why he doesn't just buy one nice one and be done.
[05:19:30] <artao> the neutron was 300, the rest under 250
[05:20:16] <TomatoSynn> i have a neutron. underrated.
[05:21:11] <artao> agreed
[05:21:25] <artao> i think some people were expecting something else LOL
[05:21:38] <artao> which is fair. but no reason to criticize the synth
[05:22:05] <artao> the delay is a bit weak. granted. when you mix it in you have to simultaneously increase the final output gain
[05:22:15] <artao> annoying, but whatever
[05:22:26] <macrobat> you want 1 nylon, 1 dreadnought, 1 humbucker, 1 singlecoil. four guitars should be enough?
[05:22:37] <LibertyDillo> haha
[05:22:37] <artao> people complained about the oscillators being voerdriven into the filter
[05:23:01] <artao> well .. yeah. that's part of the character. you can work around that be routing osc 1&2 into an attenuator then that into the filter
[05:23:06] <artao> whatever </rant>
[05:23:30] <artao> different brands of pickups too macrobat. and positions
[05:23:53] <artao> sound characteristics of the woods involved
[05:24:37] <artao> avoid rosewood unless they can prove it's properly acquired. it's wild endangered and poached

[05:33:31] <buZz> yes, i praise this
[05:33:44] <TXDillo> whereabouts in the bible belt?
[05:34:03] <buZz> 'Ede' in the netherlands
[05:34:16] <buZz> ;) many such belts around
[05:34:20] <TXDillo> ok
[05:34:33] <buZz> and i know my english does not suggest foreign nature
[05:34:39] <TXDillo> yeah the one in the US is generally some of the more Southern States
[05:34:56] <buZz> in NL its kinda the area around the rivers
[05:35:07] <buZz> the big rivers used for transport of cargo
[05:35:13] <TXDillo> Bible Belt - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Belt
[05:35:14] <Janet> ^ The Bible Belt is a region of the Southern United States in which socially conservative Christianity plays a strong role in society and politics, and church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's...
[05:35:46] <buZz> TXDillo: https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijbelgordel
[05:35:47] <Janet> ^ De Bijbelgordel ook wel Biblebelt, Bĳbelbelt of refoband, is een aanduiding voor een vrij brede strook die door Nederland loopt van Zeeland naar Overijssel. In deze strook wonen relatief veel bevindelijk gereformeerden.
[05:35:55] <buZz> oh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Belt_(Netherlands)
[05:35:55] <Janet> ^ The Bible Belt is a strip of land in the Netherlands with the highest concentration of conservative orthodox Calvinist Protestants in the country. Although the term is recent the Dutch Bible belt has existed for many generations.
[05:36:13] <buZz> conorthcalvprot , riiight
[05:36:21] <TXDillo> Hah, never considered such a thing could exist in Europe
[05:36:21] <buZz> totally unconditional love!
[05:36:58] <buZz> TXDillo: US is only a bad facsimile of european culture from yesteryear
[05:37:03] <TXDillo> So the Dutch have their own Bible?  That I also did not know
[05:37:08] <buZz> wanna hear a dumb US joke
[05:37:14] <TXDillo> absolutely
[05:37:23] <buZz> > whats the diff between US and a bowl of yoghurt
[05:37:34] <buZz> < yoghurt grows a culture within 800yrs
[05:37:34] <TXDillo> do tell...
[05:37:39] <TXDillo> hahahaha
[05:37:42] <TXDillo> good one
[05:37:46] <buZz> :)
[05:38:06] <buZz> its a good one cause its kinda honest to how the world sees this young nation :)
[05:38:07] <TXDillo> Well, the US is lots of different cultures of course
[05:38:20] <buZz> obv, as is europe
[05:38:26] <TXDillo> our common bond is The Constitution and Bill Of Rights
[05:38:26] <buZz> or any region really
[05:38:50] <TXDillo> Sure, the EU is made of of many different cultures
[05:39:36] <buZz> 99% of which is your origin
[05:39:58] <TXDillo> We've got people who speak French in Louisiana, and the neighboring State of Texas is majority Hispanic so you hear Spanish all the time
[05:40:05] <buZz> US is the colony that refused to give the land back to natives
[05:40:19] <buZz> i think the only colony on earth thats still like that
[05:40:25] <macrobat> Calvin was the calvin of calvin and hobbes
[05:40:33] <TXDillo> There are some pretty major Indian Reservations in the US
[05:41:03] <TXDillo> The Lakota Sioux have their own nation
[05:41:21] <buZz> all dutch ppl learn 4 languages in highschool, english, dutch, german and french, some also learn spanish, latin, ancient greek and/or esperanto
[05:41:24] <TXDillo> but yes generally the Native Americans got F'd :(
[05:41:36] <TXDillo> wow, that's impressive
[05:41:44] <buZz> since ages ago
[05:41:48] <buZz> maybe the 60s?
[05:42:14] <TXDillo> I learned a little French in school
[05:42:18] <buZz> its why on the street in .nl , you have ~80% chance the person you randomly meet is fluent in conversational english
[05:42:23] <TXDillo> but that was many decades ago
[05:42:37] <buZz> french and german you'll get much lower percentages
[05:42:39] <TXDillo> of course Canada is bi-lingual
[05:42:46] <buZz> some britpop? youtube.com/watch?v=_8YRx47oylM

[05:43:36] <buZz> i have friends in quebec though

[20:55:08] <murthy> morlog: I have a doubt about disk cloning, can you help? You can help me when you free
[20:56:13] <morlog> um, what kind of cloning
[20:56:24] <morlog> a backup or a complete clone of the drive
[20:56:36] <murthy> I am upgrading my 250 mb SSD to 1tb
[20:56:44] <morlog> clonezilla has a livecd that will do everything for you automatic
[20:56:45] <murthy> Want to clone it and resize
[20:57:01] <murthy> But the thing is the OS boot stuff is UEFI
[20:57:04] <morlog> well, what os are you using
[20:57:11] <murthy> And the bios is configured for it
[20:57:20] <murthy> KDE Neon
[20:57:35] <murthy> Also partition type is GPT
[20:57:39] <morlog> all the bootloader stuff should transfer over just fine
[20:58:12] <murthy> There is a fat32 partition that contains the UEFI stuff and..
[20:58:30] <morlog> you may have to change some stuff in fstab
[20:58:35] <morlog> yeah
[20:58:46] <morlog> when you clone it that will transfer over
[20:59:04] <morlog> go download clonezilla, it will handle all the heavy lifting for you
[20:59:06] <murthy> I was wondering where does the bios look for UEFI, the disk 0th sector or uefi partition
[20:59:20] <morlog> its on a chip on the mobo
[20:59:27] <murthy> Oh yes

[21:00:11] <murthy> Also can it tollerate the disk change as I remember newer versions of Linux uses uuid?
[21:00:27] <morlog> you know, you could just do a backup of your home folder, save it to a flash drive, and then reinstall and do a system restore
[21:01:10] <murthy> So I will just create a gpt filesystem on the new drive, copy all the partitions and resize?

[21:04:02] <morlog> especially when dealing with an open source os
[21:04:08] <murthy> Yes
[21:04:12] <morlog> check out timeshift
[21:04:17] <murthy> Ok
[21:04:40] <morlog> thats probably a bit easier than clonezilla and is probably already installed on your computer
[21:05:02] <murthy> Is timeshift related to btrfs?
[21:05:14] <morlog> should let you do a full backup and migration to a bigger drive
[21:05:31] <morlog> timeshift is just a system backup program
[21:05:44] <murthy> Oh ok
[21:05:58] <morlog> should be in the administrative section of your start menu
[21:06:12] <murthy> I will better have a supergrub disk ready
[21:06:12] <morlog> well, the linux version of the start menu
[21:06:35] <murthy> Kde one is kickoff

[21:06:51] <morlog> you can use dd to do a full copy over to the other drive to
[21:07:01] <morlog> you just need to edit fstab
[21:07:02] <murthy> Yes indeed
[21:07:19] <morlog> in fstab is where you put the uuid of the drive
[21:07:19] <murthy> Yes
[21:07:55] <murthy> I am guessing it won't boot because of wrong  root uuid

[23:13:44] <TXDillo> Going to have a carb mod installed which should make it more responsive, and we talked about a 70cc mod that would make a big difference

[23:14:46] <TXDillo> the 70cc mod includes a new head with new valves
[23:15:29] <morlog> yeah
[23:15:41] <morlog> there is also a 100cc mod
[23:15:56] <TXDillo> more than that available even
[23:16:01] <morlog> be aware that if you do that your supposed to reregister your scooter as a motorcycle
[23:16:11] <TXDillo> but it would take out out of the Moped class
[23:16:15] <morlog> yeah
[23:16:36] <morlog> the carb mod will probably do a lot more than you think
[23:16:51] <TXDillo> They said the 70cc mod looks just like the 49cc, and would probably pass inspection
[23:16:54] <morlog> because the engines are so small a little does a lot
[23:17:16] <morlog> thats if they dont do a displacement test
[23:17:34] <TXDillo> true

[23:18:10] <morlog> my friend is loving the 150cc one he got
[23:18:27] <TXDillo> Again, since the appearance is the same, and it still says 49cc it might go unnoticed 
[23:18:34] <TXDillo> I'll bet he does :)
[23:18:51] <morlog> yeah, it will most likely not be noticed
[23:19:21] <TXDillo> I'm just trying to avoid having to go through the rigamarole of having to take classes and get a MC license
[23:19:23] <morlog> most of the people you see drivving those motorized bicycles have the 80cc motors
[23:19:35] <morlog> yeah
[23:19:53] <morlog> I'm thinking of taking them after i get my scooter paid off
[23:20:00] <TXDillo> We'll see what the carb mod does first.  Maybe it'll be enough
[23:20:25] <morlog> exhaust mods are also something good to look into
[23:20:33] <morlog> that also helps
[23:20:49] <morlog> also stator mods

[23:21:39] <TXDillo> hah, interesting
[23:21:50] <morlog> its what the motor uses to generate electricity for the spark plugs and lights
[23:22:01] <TXDillo> yeah, that I know
[23:22:13] <TXDillo> just never heard the term 'stator' before
[23:22:40] <morlog> the stator is actually a specific part
