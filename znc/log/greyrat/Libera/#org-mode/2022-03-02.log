[12:50:54] <morsing> pjb: Thanks, but I'd have to install a tonne of X software and libraries for that.

[12:51:54] <pjb> morsing: a good alternative, is to use emacs locally. so, on mac, http://emacsformacosx.com  and to use tramp to access files on the linux box.
[12:52:08] <pjb> morsing: the X server is Xquartz, installed with a single dmg
[12:52:14] <morsing> If I use Emacs locally, I can only access it from one place.
[12:52:53] <pjb> You can have several emacs instances, each on a different workstation, all accessing the same files with tramp.
[12:52:54] <morsing> No, the client end, the cloud server, needs hundreds of megabytes of X libraries install to run an X client.
[12:53:19] <pjb> You probably already have them, on a linux box…
[12:53:19] <morsing> Tramp? Ok, will Google that.

[12:55:42] <pjb> emacs detects when you open a file from different instances, or when you overwrite one.

[21:37:20] <Codaraxis> I'm considering coding in my own special property, "MEETING", so that I don't have to use DEADLINE/SCHEDULE but still get useful features like advanced warnings.
[21:37:27] <Codaraxis> Before I do, though, could someone explain why the canonical suggestion is to just use active timestamps?
[21:44:46] <konubinix> Codaraxis: I think this is an inversion of the burden of proof. If active timestamp and APPT_WARNTIME is enough for people, I assume you should explain to them what they miss in this scenario.

[21:55:48] <BerntH> Codaraxis:  What are you trying to achieve with your change?
[21:57:58] <Codaraxis> Ideally, I'd like a single property that a) allows me to set a time for a appointment; b) allows me to set advanced warnings on a per appointment basis; and c) would allow me to filter the agenda for just appointments with that property, since it would be redundant to add a  meeting  tag.
[21:58:44] *** Joins: Null_A (~null_a@c-98-210-133-39.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[21:59:51] <Codaraxis> (a) Can be done with active time stamps. (b) would require me to use SCHEDULED and DEADLINE in non-canonical ways, since those seem to be "scheduled to start work" and "work needs to be finished by" respectively. (c) This would just simplify things by having one fewer tag.
[22:01:35] <BerntH> if your meeting is a a fixed time what you do you SCHEDULED/DEADLINE for at all?  just put an active timestamp covering your meeting time

[22:04:00] <Codaraxis> BerntH, I can't do things like <2022-03-02 Wed 18:00 -3d> with active timestamps
[22:04:20] <Codaraxis> And there are occasionally meetings so far in the future or that are so important that I'd like to see them in the Agenda before I get to them
[22:05:15] <Codaraxis> If I were to do things semi-canonically, I'd create the meeting * My Important Meeting <2022-03-02 Wed 18:00>   and then create a sub-task, * TODO Prepare for my important meeting  with a DEADLINE set for that day
[22:05:52] <Codaraxis> but that seems inefficient, and sometimes it's literally just a case of, I want to just see the upcoming meeting so I know to plan around it, not necessary plan for it.
[22:06:42] <BerntH> okay... so DEADLINE: does what you want for alerts ahead of time doesn't it?  Having to manage a new property (which hides your date in the property drawer) is just different - why is it better?
[22:08:55] <Demosthenex> Codaraxis: to your point the other day, i have no issues with caches as intermediaries, even sqlite ;]
[22:09:04] <BerntH> Personally a meeting for me is something I Need to attend (and not prepare for).  If I am presenting then I have additional tasks to do the prep work ahead of time (and those have a DEADLINE -- the meeting is still at a fixed time so either just scheduled or an active timestamp for me - I usually use SCHEDULED so if I forget to mark it done it's in my agenda tomorrow
[22:09:40] <Demosthenex> my issue is always followup. sent an email, need a reminder in a week to follow up :P

[22:32:55] <Codaraxis> BerntH, Well, even then, it's nice to know in advance or have some sort of reminders. I have dentist appointments every 6 months, give or take. It's nice to be reminded that it'll be within a month without having to manually looking ahead in my calendar constantly
[22:35:24] <Codaraxis> And it'd take tiny modifications/additional hooks in a bunch of different places, probably. However, it would also save me from having to tag it with meeting, be good practice, and somewhat importantly to me, have the content of files reflect my mental model a bit better

[22:47:18] <Codaraxis> Demosthenex, I have a similar issue with followups. I mostly do that by having the main task be "Do the thing" and then having sub-tasks to Contact people or just log entries when I reached out without creating a task. Afterwards, I set the main task to WAITING and reschedule it for the day I want to follow up.
[22:47:23] <Codaraxis> I have a FOLLOWUP task state, but haven't mentally distinguished it with WAITING, since I'm usually waiting for them to get back to me and only want to follow-up if they don't get back to me first.

[22:48:18] <Codaraxis> And I really should probably use LOGBOOK notes, but for some reason, I'm not comfortable with them yet. It feels stifling, but I think that's irrational and will need to dedicate a couple weeks to just using them to get comfortable

[22:58:59] <bookdoorstop> Demosthenex: Exactly! `emacs --batch --no-init-file -l publish.el -f org-publish-all` is the command I'm running. Everything works fine and my website is generated, but this hook only works if I initialize emacs
[22:59:34] <bookdoorstop> "Initialize" meaning that a windows/tty has showed up
[22:59:58] <Demosthenex> yes, because your init.el is loading then
[23:00:19] <Demosthenex> --no-init-file may be disabling things
[23:00:37] <bookdoorstop> I'm running it with the `no-init-file` too, just omiting the `--batch` and opening the publish.el file
[23:01:01] <Demosthenex> publish needs org too? how are dependencies resolved?
[23:02:36] *** Quits: Codaraxis (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:02:47] <bookdoorstop> This is my current file https://paste.sr.ht/blob/344f1d5ec64a0770a85de979e245f1684e7cf9f0 . I'm installing dependencies with Nix however the hook only works if I eval the buffer inside emacs already
[23:03:16] <corwin> org is built in so you shouldn't have issues getting org to load (unless you have a different org in your .emacs.d/elpa tree in which case, I'm not sure but I suspect you might get the older version while using the no-init-file option
[23:04:02] <Demosthenex> i'm just saying that using org/emacs in a batch job isn't quite the same as loading it interactively, which is what you already said
[23:05:42] <bookdoorstop> corwin: I'm at `Emacs 27.2 (Org mode 9.5.2)`, I got these values at the output of my website
[23:06:04] <Demosthenex> like, i call emacs from a makefile. i call "emacs -nw --eval '(setq enable-local-variables :all)' -f org-export-as-latex -f save-buffers-kill-emacs $filename"
[23:06:46] <bookdoorstop> I can't run `--nw` on a CI as there's no tty :( 
[23:07:23] <Demosthenex> yeah, so skip that ;]
[23:07:41] <Demosthenex> notice i still load my config, i didn't specify --no-init-file
[23:07:48] <Demosthenex> org loads like it would interactively
[23:07:53] <Demosthenex> and all my settings for org load too
[23:08:05] <ieure> bookdoorstop, I build .ics files from my Org agenda in Jenkins, the CI command is `emacs -batch -l export.el` and export.el is all the code to make it run.
[23:08:10] <Demosthenex> then emacs opens the file, and executes M-x org-export-as-latex
[23:08:23] <ieure> bookdoorstop, I can share that code if it'd be helpful for you.
[23:09:13] <bookdoorstop> ieure: does it make use of `org-export-before-processing-hook`? This the only thing not working currently, my website builds just fine but I use this hook to get backlinks for my notes
[23:10:17] <ieure> bookdoorstop, No, I don't use that.  All the setup is in export.el, before it triggers the export.
[23:10:43] <ieure> It runs with a bare config, instead of my usual one, so it sets everything up from the default state.

[23:42:52] <bookdoorstop> I have no init file on my CI however my code should be self-sufficient, right?
[23:43:13] <bookdoorstop> It just read files with org

[23:47:42] <Demosthenex> have you tried starting your emacs without an init interactively?
[23:52:12] <bookdoorstop> yep, I installed only the needed module to test too
[23:52:23] <bookdoorstop> interactively it works, on batch mode it won't
[23:55:39] <bookdoorstop> don't worry! I'll find a way to do this
[23:55:44] <bookdoorstop> thank you so much, guys!
