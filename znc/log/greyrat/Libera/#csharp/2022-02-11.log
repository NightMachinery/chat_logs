[00:30:16] <Ownix> How can I provide a custom implementation of Dependency here? https://dotnetfiddle.net/Z0jbzM
[00:30:47] <Ownix> I have an ugly static class in a legacy library, that is used by 10 different apps. One of the apps needs to alter the functionality a bit.
[00:31:32] <Ownix> My first approach would be to create a static property like `public static IDependency dependencyImplementation { get; set; } = new DefaultDependency();`
[00:31:42] <Ownix> Then any caller could just change it by composition.
[00:32:33] <GetShwifty> and you're not using Service Locator?
[00:33:02] <Ownix> GetShwifty: Like Dependency Injection?
[00:33:08] <GetShwifty> yeah
[00:33:13] <GetShwifty> like MS Extension.dependency ..
[00:33:14] <Ownix> Unfortunately not, its very old legacy code
[00:33:26] <Ownix> The entire library is initialized with this static class as the entrypoint

[00:33:47] <GetShwifty> is the type going to be in an assembly loaded?
[00:34:08] <GetShwifty> so user provides name as a parameter. you do a  SHIT TON of security checks to make sure it's safe, / right type (and supposed to be exposed) before instantiating it?
[00:34:09] <Ownix> No, its just called in the Global.asax Application_Start method on every caller.
[00:34:51] <Ownix> Im not sure I follow
[00:35:16] <GetShwifty> what exactly is your question
[00:35:23] <GetShwifty> beacuse the question you asked seems pretty simple to me
[00:35:38] <GetShwifty> you have a way for a user to provide a type.  whether user provided, config provieed, etc
[00:35:59] <GetShwifty> you have a way to validate that it should be set so somebody can't just hijack your app and injet any type that is loaded in the app domain
[00:36:00] <Ownix> Well, im wondering if I should use composition, or if I should move Dependency to a class with a virtual GetString that I override
[00:36:14] <GetShwifty> composition would be the 'proper' way to do it imho
[00:36:51] <Ownix> GetShwifty: well, if the app gets hijacked and people can inject types and load stuff we have bigger problems
[00:37:22] <brianonymous> that could be true of methods themselves, to be fair
[00:38:05] * brianonymous alters ownix's jmp table
[00:38:07] <GetShwifty> only if you'r exposing them in the same ay brianonymous
[00:38:14] <GetShwifty> and in which case like i said
[00:38:24] <GetShwifty> make sure you have something that eaisly quickly ensures that it should be
[00:38:25] <Ownix> So... the problem is someone wrote this library that wraps all of our database calls. It calls a legacy Web Service to get the connection strings. The web service requires a token passed by the caller.
[00:38:29] <GetShwifty> e.g. i use an ExportAttribute
[00:38:36] <Ownix> Which is stored in the Web.Config. Its a nightmare.
[00:39:10] <GetShwifty> stuff that i have exposed as being able to be instantiated via 'magic strings' have to pass through a registration database matching a specific implementation type AND then once that's done if the type is not decorated it's not being instantiated
[00:39:49] <Ownix> The library is initialized by a single static class, theres a dozen properties like DBAConnectionString, DB2ConnectionString. If you call the getter on them, they invoke the web service to go get the data if it has not been done already.
[00:40:31] <Suchiman> Ownix: if you only need a GetString method though, you can just use a Func<string> :trollface:
[00:40:58] <Ownix> Ha Suchiman my first approach I thought of was a delegate since I prefer that.
[00:42:04] <GetShwifty> want to stab the idiots that introduced the stupid "delay in search/replace" registering what's going on bug
[00:42:32] <Ownix> Suchiman: in my example GetString takes an int, if I provide an alternative dependency, it wont need the int provided. So ill end up with `GetString(int payload){ return "hardcoded string that does not need payload int"; }`
[00:43:04] <Ownix> But the default dependency requires the int. So, maybe theres just no way around that.
[00:43:42] <Suchiman> if the user of the dependency and not the supplier of the dependency needs to provide the int, then yeah, there's no way around it
[00:44:42] <GetShwifty> 2 or 3 days of writing code wihout testing it :D

[02:32:21] <lz_> GetShwifty: actually I'm reading 62% of deaths are vaxed, and 80% of ppl are vaxed
[02:32:45] <lz_> being vaxed probably divides by 5 or 10 your risks of hosp/death
[02:32:47] <GetShwifty> yeah that statistic makex sense
[02:33:05] <GetShwifty> honestyu my take on everything is
[02:33:12] <GetShwifty> EVERYBODY has been SOOO fucking wrong about this whole fucking thing
[02:33:24] <GetShwifty> Texas and France are at polar opposites as far as policy opn covid
[02:33:26] <GetShwifty> and guess what
[02:33:27] <lz_> nah, not gonna brag but I was right since maybe march 2020
[02:33:32] <lz_> :D
[02:33:33] <GetShwifty> we're doing better trhan you guys
[02:33:37] <GetShwifty> like way better
[02:33:47] <GetShwifty> and we're not protesting because we've been locked up
[02:33:53] <lz_> I remember in march I went to a drug store and the clerc thought I was crazy when I told her we were all gonna get it
[02:34:04] <GetShwifty> everybody HAD to get it
[02:34:14] <GetShwifty> thats why the 'everybody wear masks ( useless) " everybody shut down so nobody gets it
[02:34:20] <GetShwifty> approach was the wrong approach from the get go
[02:34:27] <lz_> GetShwifty: lol I've read so many fucked up things about texas and covid, sorry but I don't believe you :D
[02:34:30] <GetShwifty> and after wave 2 , 3 and 4 . STILL is the wrong appraoch
[02:34:37] <GetShwifty> how so?
[02:34:44] <GetShwifty> our hospitals have not been over run for a long time
[02:34:49] <GetShwifty> people aren't dying in the streets
[02:35:01] <GetShwifty> our death rates are in line with our per capita
[02:35:04] <lz_> GetShwifty: isnt there a guy named "do santos" or sth in texas?
[02:35:15] <GetShwifty> there's a million do santos
[02:35:17] <GetShwifty> in texas
[02:35:22] <lz_> I mean a mayor or sth
[02:35:25] <lz_> but maybe it's florida
[02:35:33] <GetShwifty> florida has fucked up a lot
[02:35:41] <lz_> ah maybe I'm mixing up with florida nevermind
[02:35:54] <GetShwifty> but eeven flroida SORT of got it right
[02:35:58] <GetShwifty> in the fact that
[02:36:00] <lz_> ron desantis
[02:36:03] <GetShwifty> 'everybody has to get it'
[02:36:18] <GetShwifty> and that vaccinations ARE NOT going to be able to keep up with mutations
[02:36:29] <lz_> GetShwifty: omicron is still much less lethal than previous variants, especially with the vaccine. confinment, masks, all made sense
[02:36:33] <GetShwifty> yep
[02:36:43] <GetShwifty> thats why omicron was the best one to just let it run wild
[02:36:48] <GetShwifty> and just 'get it over with'
[02:37:01] <GetShwifty> but it still was the most vaccine evasive
[02:37:13] <GetShwifty> and the next could veryu well could be even more. and they've still not gotten a proper booster for omicron
[02:37:41] <lz_> yeah how much more contagious it got was crazy, there's no time to deploy a new vaccine when it spreads so fast
[02:38:55] <GetShwifty> i have a theory
[02:39:06] <GetShwifty> and that is it might not actaully be THAT much more contagious
[02:39:10] <lz_> ron desantis is a fucking douche, but yeah it's florida https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article255929071.html
[02:39:11] <GetShwifty> and while being LESS violent
[02:39:29] <GetShwifty> it might have had a 2 or 4x "completley asymotpomatic"
[02:39:39] <GetShwifty> meaning MORE people went to get tested
[02:39:40] <lz_> it absolutely is, it was known since december or november
[02:39:58] <GetShwifty> yeah
[02:40:00] <lz_> no, we know it is because of the % of the variant in the positive tests, it went 10 times faster
[02:40:12] <GetShwifty> lol
[02:40:29] <lz_> it went 10 times faster than delta to be the only variant spreading
[02:42:05] <lz_> GetShwifty: https://cdn-s-www.bienpublic.com/images/da3ea456-199a-46b5-a640-e524a51925bc/NW_listA/title-1638186408.jpg

[02:52:08] <DevJohnC> it's easier to tell your buddies you reckon it's airborne vs. guiding the entire governmental response by saying it's airborne
[02:52:14] <DevJohnC> though the CDC is kinda shitting the bed
[02:53:14] <lz_> DevJohnC: it was really obvious from the data at the time, but *even* if it wasn't obvious, putting masks or home made masks would have been the safe thing to do
[02:53:36] <lz_> instead they said no no don't put masks it'll give a "false sense of security" lol
[02:53:45] <DevJohnC> yeah, that was bad
[02:54:01] <lz_> and now ppl use this as an excuse for the government's mess with masks (they didn't have the stock they were supposed to have)
[02:54:50] <DevJohnC> well, that is kinda true for the US - our supply chain here is "just in time" so we did seriously need to keep masks around for healthcare workers, but I still think it was wrong to tell people that wearing masks wasn't the correct thing to do
[02:55:11] <lz_> here they had destroyed 90% of our mask stock a few months before the pandemic :D
[02:55:14] <DevJohnC> but now even with masks being the very least you can do to help stop the spread fucking nobody wears them around here
[02:56:38] <lz_> I understand it was important to keep them for health workers, but I still wish they asked ppl to make home made ones

[12:02:32] <MatthiasVance> *often
[12:02:53] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Ohh i have but he doesn't seem it as a problem
[12:03:09] <MatthiasVance> wuuut
[12:03:13] <MaNa2k> so im getting a vibe here that people usually just code without really testing until the end? isnt that considered bad practice?
[12:03:27] <MaNa2k> i have learned that one should be testing their code while coding
[12:03:44] <MatthiasVance> As usual: "it depends"
[12:03:45] <MaNa2k> ofc, simple stuff isnt that important to test
[12:04:03] <jmer> I test my code continously by pressing F5
[12:04:30] <MaNa2k> jmer, yea me too, im practically coding during debugging, watching the variables change, etc
[12:04:40] <jmer> I don't do that. xD
[12:04:45] <MaNa2k> oh oki
[12:04:56] <jmer> too easy to produce results that aren't realistic when the program runs normally
[12:05:04] <MaNa2k> hmm
[12:05:07] <jmer> but that might be a matter of taste
[12:05:22] <jmer> also edit and continue didn't work with 64bit code for a very long time
[12:05:23] <MaNa2k> i feel like i have better control that way, might be bad though
[12:05:32] <jmer> if it works for you, it works. xD
[12:06:07] <MaNa2k> well lataly edit\continue has become really shitty with all the new projects that are aimd against azure cloud
[12:06:30] <MaNa2k> in a simple console app, it works flawlessly
[12:06:54] <MaNa2k> maybe i should just start off making a console app, then at the end migrate it to a azure project
[12:07:06] <MatthiasVance> Or find a way to change your framework to allow some sample data
[12:07:09] <MatthiasVance> So you can just run tests
[12:07:10] <MaNa2k> like ex. function timer\servicebus\ etc app
[12:07:29] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, ? im on .net 6
[12:07:48] <MatthiasVance> Yes but you said you have some kind of framework for setting up new integrations
[12:08:06] <MatthiasVance> My advice, start out with the test first and the expected result
[12:08:26] <MatthiasVance> If you do HTTP calls you can have a HttpHandler which feeds the HttpClient sample responses
[12:08:34] <MatthiasVance> So you don't have to change much code
[12:08:48] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, ah, its baiscally how to structure the projects\ folders\naming, common code and some other stuff
[12:08:58] <MatthiasVance> Ohh okay
[12:09:47] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, we use restsharp for handling most of our http calls
[12:10:01] <MaNa2k> but got to run now, good talking to you

[12:10:47] <Nasp> MaNa2k:  Didn't we talk about TDD last week?
[12:11:25] <MaNa2k> nope
[12:11:28] <Nasp> We did
[12:11:30] <Nasp> We talked about test

[12:29:04] <ap5> I need to change team then, but yes sure why not xD
[12:29:17] <jmer> It has to become cheaper ap5
[12:29:25] <ap5> I am on it
[12:29:26] <jmer> hahaha xD
[12:29:36] <ap5> A flat round zero?
[12:29:54] <jmer> too obvious just give me last 2019 prices
[12:32:45] <MatthiasVance> Or increase the number of years on his contract
[12:32:47] <MatthiasVance> for the old prices
[12:32:50] <MatthiasVance> That might work?

[12:34:12] <Kim^J> Yes, the non-encrypted FTP.
[12:34:23] <jmer> the erorr I am encountering is that the file used for the past... I don't know... Probably decades
[12:34:28] <jmer> suddenly only have 9 fields instead of 18
[12:34:38] <Kim^J> :D
[12:35:53] <Kim^J> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_data_record
[12:36:11] <Kim^J> The world runs on old FTP servers passing CSVs around
[12:36:18] <Kim^J> And Excel files.
[12:36:22] <Kim^J> Soo many Excel files
[12:37:22] <jmer> is the suicide rate of developers higher than the norm?

[12:37:26] <jmer> ... if it is, this is why
[12:37:36] <Nasp> Kim^J:  FTP and binary file formats
[12:37:47] <Nasp> They were binary when i worked in telco and yes FTP
[12:37:59] <Nasp> Binary in a format that wasn't documented
[12:43:27] <Kim^J> jmer: I think the higher wages offset that
[12:43:46] <Kim^J> Nasp: Ah might be binary, I haven't opened any, I just manage the FTP servers
[12:44:04] <Kim^J> People order an FTP server, I deliver an FTP server.
[12:44:18] <jmer> Funny with all the focus on https
[12:44:21] <jmer> but no focus on ftps
[12:56:03] <Nasp> Kim^J: Pretty sure it's a binary format
[12:56:17] <Nasp> We couldn't get documentation on how to parse it
[12:56:26] <Nasp> So we found some c++ lib where somebody had made C# wrappers

[13:34:36] <jmer> hey Tobbi_
[13:35:15] <MatthiasVance> I am happy, just created a draft PR for my shit so we can discuss and change things next week and finish the implementation :D
[13:35:29] <Tobbi_> draft PR for your shit? alright?
[13:35:30] <MatthiasVance> It's a relief that I finally achieved something on this task
[13:36:05] <ap5> What have you been doing?
[13:36:09] <ap5> Printer thing?
[13:36:14] <MatthiasVance> Printer thing?
[13:36:35] <ap5> I have heard you talk about printer stuff
[13:36:45] <ap5> maybe you did something together since you mentioned a PR
[13:37:07] <MatthiasVance> I was having trouble working on some work project a few weeks ago so moved to other tasks that were more clear and in a known bounded context which was great but at some point I had to move back and help out and I finally made progress
[13:38:16] <MichaelLong> I would have a hard time doing that.
[13:39:59] <ap5> MatthiasVance, AAAAH xD
[13:40:32] <ap5> I read it as you talking to somebody here in this channel. I was just super pumped because i have made the nicest unit test ever
[13:40:54] <ap5> MichaelLong, it would nag you to the point where you didn't get any sleep
[13:41:08] <MatthiasVance> Ohh I see now ap5!
[13:41:20] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: Hard time doing what?
[13:41:34] <MatthiasVance> ap5: Neat! What is the unit test?
[13:43:06] <ap5> MatthiasVance, i have created a custom configuration provider that reads a json file from a folder and map it into a dictionary. The funky part is to get a string when you want a string, a number when you want a number etc, so i have coded it and covered it by a pretty sweet unit test that really test all cases :)
[13:45:10] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, moving to other stuff when knowning that there's an obstactle that I need to overcome anyway.
[13:45:36] <jmer> I am like MatthiasVance  in this regard... If you are stuck on something it can be nice to move to another task
[13:45:49] <jmer> ... like I've been hammering on this damn task since I got hired and random shit keeps popping up
[13:45:59] <jmer> and it feels so damn demotivating not finishing this shitty task.
[13:46:13] <jmer> and I don't have any interesting tasks to work on, on the side
[13:46:17] <jmer> only putting out fires
[13:46:21] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: Well, the thing that was blocking me was my state of mind / energy level
[13:46:39] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: So moving to a more familiar domain helped keep the balance :)
[13:47:39] <MatthiasVance> ap5: Why does it have to be a dictionary?
[13:47:54] <MichaelLong> yeah I know, and it is even recommended to do so. Still for me the success of "other" simpler tasks feels diminished in contrast to the waiting blocking task.
[13:48:11] <ap5> MatthiasVance, because i add it to the IConfiguration
[13:48:30] <ap5> And then it maps to an IOptions
[13:48:46] <ap5> I have a very edgy case where we need to do this
[13:48:49] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[13:48:55] <MatthiasVance> so you can't directly have it deserialize it?
[13:48:57] *** Joins: vim_fans (~pi@user/vim-fans/x-3284168)
[13:51:44] <ap5> No because they reside in different subfolders, and i need to prepend the folder names /secrets/SendGrid/config.json should be added as "SendGrid:Property" etc, so i can map "SendGrid:*" to a class named SendGrid etc :D
[13:53:10] <ap5> So when our infrastructure team says "there is new secret here: /secrets/verySecret/configuration.json" we just add it to our configuration and we can map it
[13:57:51] <jmer> aah so you are injecting secrets into your config like that

[14:34:35] <Nasp> Babbage:  Yes?
[14:34:39] <Nasp> Or is there an underlying question
[14:34:49] <ap5> Nasp, this isn't for docker. This is a consul agent that mounts a folder into our pod
[14:35:06] <Nasp> Well same same
[14:35:12] <Nasp> But why is an entire json file?
[14:35:20] <Nasp> How much does that json file contain
[14:35:37] <Babbage> nope, just out of interest. only really seem one project ehre going as far as doing all the service side of using DI, and the result is a bloody confusing nightmare to understand and maintain
[14:35:50] <ap5> It can be either an json configuration file og a file with a single line
[14:35:54] <Nasp> Babbage: As in static code or new it up yourself?

[14:46:42] <jonp> i have worked on some codebases which used DI, and despised it.
[14:46:59] <jonp> i understand that it can be useful, but i've never been in those situations
[14:47:46] <Nasp> What do you use instead?
[14:47:59] <Nasp> ANd do you just mean IoC containers
[14:48:03] <Nasp> Or no DI at all
[14:48:06] <jonp> i don't use DI at all
[14:48:16] <Nasp> Just gluing things tightly together
[14:48:45] <Nasp> What do you do for a db connection?
[14:48:46] <jonp> if i need "not tightly", i have interfaces and classes and virtuals
[14:48:48] <jonp> i don't need DI
[14:48:49] <Nasp> Just new it up when needed
[14:48:51] <jonp> and i don't use DBs
[14:48:57] <Nasp> Ahh
[14:49:00] <canton7> What about anything static? That's my main use for DI
[14:49:02] <Nasp> Well some domains are different that way
[14:49:19] <Nasp> But if you have certain types of resources you need to inject stuff
[14:49:19] <canton7> User manager, event bus, serial connection, navigation controller for a desktop app, etc etc
[14:49:37] <jonp> canton7: i don't think i'd want a static field controlled by DI
[14:49:37] <Nasp> canton7:  What do you mean with static is your main usecase for DI?
[14:49:44] <jonp> sounds like a disaster for unit tests
[14:49:50] <Nasp> Ohh yeah that sounds nasty
[14:49:57] <canton7> Nasp, as in, most of the services I inject are singletons, and without DI they'd have to be statics
[14:50:09] <Nasp> Although i've just considered making a threadstatic / asynclocal field with that
[14:50:18] <Nasp> But that's to fix all the existing code that's using static instead of DI
[14:51:20] <canton7> So DI is a way to avoid statics, and instead have single instances which are injected into the things that need to access them
[14:51:52] <Nasp> Yeah or more like the service who uses service X doesn't have to worry about if it's a singleton or not
[14:51:59] <Nasp> It's provided to them and it just uses it as is
[14:52:32] <canton7> Yeah. I new up the event bus in one place and just pass it to the things that need it, rather than having to store it somewhere static, and having everything that needs it access that static
[14:52:53] <Nasp> And by passing do you mean in ctor?
[14:57:33] <PMunch> Hmm, so I take it there is no way to get the size of a string written to a stream without calculating it myself then?

[15:51:59] <Nasp> MAybe someone should try and get burning of wood marked as not green
[15:52:00] <jmer> our current government is a bunch of clowns
[15:52:03] <Nasp> Then he will be in trouble
[15:52:07] <Nasp> Indeed
[15:52:09] <Nasp> More windmills!
[15:52:16] <Nasp> We need to fly green
[15:52:22] <Nasp> Instead of taking the train green first
[15:52:31] <jmer> More windmills won't make a difference before we find an effecient way of storing their output
[15:53:06] <jmer> Afaik we are overproducing power when it's windy...
[15:53:14] *** Joins: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy)
[15:53:15] <jmer> but we can't store it for the times when it's not...
[15:53:47] <Nasp> That's why we are going to use power to x, so we can store it and convert it to energy for airplanes
[15:54:07] <Nasp> And that is purely because some minister wants to fly to Brussels and say "Look we can fly green" but it doesnt help a damn thing
[15:54:11] <Nasp> It actually makes it worst
[15:56:13] <Nasp> jmer:  I dont get why we are so affraid of nuclear and wants the rest of the world to have the same belief
[15:57:04] <jmer> Nasp: Fukushima and Chernobyl is the reason we're so afraid :P
[15:57:21] <jmer> But from what I've read there are safer alternatives today. but all of them are very, very expensive
[15:58:14] <jmer> It'll give us a breather to figure out something that is zero emissions but it'snot like nuclear is a permanent fix, we're simply trading one form of pollution with another one.
[15:59:44] <jmer> https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/european-project-sets-a-record-for-fusion-energy-produced-by-a-tokamak/ <- we need this
[16:00:59] <Nasp> But fusion is a dream so far
[16:01:05] <Nasp> Only viable we have now i nuclear
[16:01:28] <jmer> I wouldn't call it a dream
[16:01:31] <jmer> progress is being made
[16:01:47] <jmer> but we might need to buy ourselves more time by investing in nuclear NOW.
[16:01:58] <jmer> but it's not like we can run on nuclear for ever
[16:02:15] <jmer> afaik we generate more nuclear waste than we can get rid of.
[16:02:37] <jmer> I think we should just eject it into space, nuclear waste... But if something goes wrong it could fuck our entire planet xD
[16:02:46] <jmer> (nuclear waste in orbit doesn't sound nice)
[16:03:43] <Nasp> But we can't wait for Fusion
[16:03:47] <Nasp> It's still 20+ years away
[16:04:00] <jmer> building a new clear power plant might actually take 20 years
[16:04:05] <jmer> nuclear*
[16:04:11] <jmer> new clear... lol
[16:04:16] <Nasp> Sounds like a bad idea to throw it all on a giant rocket
[16:04:26] <jmer> yes. xD
[16:04:30] <Nasp> Yeah, but so will a fusion plant
[16:04:40] <jmer> but only slightly worse than storing it in a deep hole somwhere
[16:07:09] <interop_madness> i found this reddit post an interesting take on the supposed nuclear waste problem: https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7v76v4/what_is_something_that_sounds_extremely_wrong_but/dtqd9ey/?context=3

[16:25:27] <MatthiasVance> Saw some documentary on that

[16:30:29] <interop_madness> actually, coal power plants emit more radioactivity (per amount of work) than nuclear power plants: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/
[16:30:44] <interop_madness> ackchyually, even
[16:31:26] <MaNa2k> why cant someone just dedicate a nuclear power plan for mining only, and that will be the end of all the discussion on miners hoging all the energy
[16:32:07] <Suchiman> MaNa2k: because bitcoin mining alone consumes as much power as all of afghanistan
[16:32:33] <MaNa2k> Suchiman, hmm, that dosnt sound much
[16:32:45] <MaNa2k> arnt they still burning sticks and coal there

[21:35:36] <DevJohnC> oh that might be a winner
[21:36:44] <brianonymous> im stacking super ultras, so im biased.. and i agree
[21:36:59] <DevJohnC> do you use a single system? or multiple computers?
[21:37:27] <brianonymous> single, tho i desperately need to add a smaller stack to my left for my macbook
[21:37:42] <DevJohnC> I'm curious how the KVM in these types of monitors work
[21:37:51] <brianonymous> you looking at the samsung?
[21:38:05] <brianonymous> i think only their newest model did the kvm stuff. i thought mine did, but it was lies

[21:39:58] <brianonymous> samsung is super good at displays tho
[21:40:09] <brianonymous> i mean, in the physical sense
[21:40:34] <DevJohnC> do they manufacture the panel? because just a few months ago I think I was hearing that LG is the only company that actually produces the panels
[21:41:10] <brianonymous> yeah.. they make the ones in the apples too
[21:42:15] <DevJohnC> I was leaning towards LG, I like their TVs
[21:42:20] <brianonymous> i just googled: correction - apple buys from both lg and samsung
[21:43:05] <brianonymous> I would go with LG for oleds, Samsung for advanced QLED/LED
[21:43:30] <brianonymous> not much beats the LG oleds.. but at the cost of playing the panel lotto

[22:13:53] <brianonymous> you dont know what you are missing cuz youve been budget monitor blinded
[22:13:55] <_genuser_> JakeSays hehe, now and then I look at the logo and go, WHAT? AOC? ... oh right the monitors.
[22:14:06] <JakeSays> lol
[22:15:01] <_genuser_> JakeSays these monitors lasted about 10years or so. Now they're hiccup'ing. On cold boot, the monitors just keep flipping on/off. non stops. The one does like 1hr or so before it warms up enough to finally stay on. Then it works fine.
[22:15:03] <JakeSays> brianonymous: i went from two 12 year old super way cheap 19"ers to two brand new super cheap 27"ers. my eyes orgasmed
[22:15:06] <_genuser_> the other one takes 10-20min.

[22:15:34] <JakeSays> that was two years ago and they still pretty
[22:15:43] <_genuser_> JakeSays the samsung wide is the replacement. I just need to replace the GPU that can handle the display port and HDMI outs for the new monitor.
[22:15:51] <JakeSays> _genuser_: never heard of aoc monitors
[22:16:06] <_genuser_> well I _could_ use those VGA/HDMI converters... but better to replace the GPU. Especially, since I have the GPU already.
[22:16:29] <JakeSays> i looked at getting one of those uber moitors but couldn't justify it given the quality of my eyes
[22:16:33] <_genuser_> JakeSays budget monitors. Pretty good for the money. https://us.aoc.com/en-US
[22:16:38] <brianonymous> my son had the same experience.. he was using one of my monitors - literally 15 years old - and i made him go by a 32" modern one, because he is a cheap bastard.. he does not regret it
[22:16:47] <JakeSays> soon as i get my lenses replaced then i'll go all out
[22:16:59] <_genuser_> JakeSays like I said these lasted 10years. Cost $130/monitor at the time. And have a super slim profile.

[22:17:38] <JakeSays> eyeball lenses

[22:23:11] <brianonymous> no, i kinda hope it does
[22:23:15] <JakeSays> LOL
[22:23:38] <brianonymous> and now i demand you test it
[22:23:43] <JakeSays> LOL
[22:24:11] <JakeSays> you want video of the tests?
[22:24:21] <brianonymous> a graph is acceptable
[22:24:31] <JakeSays> no way. you must watch the video.
[22:24:46] <brianonymous> well thats going beyond, so i wont complain

[22:31:52] <brianonymous> most legit use case of a mask ive seen in awhile.. ZINNNNG

[22:43:03] <brianonymous> what exactly does this engine manage
[22:45:37] <_genuser_> the framework manages engines.
[22:47:59] <_genuser_> although the fart conversation wasn't a let down for #csharp. So you're all free to revert to that.
