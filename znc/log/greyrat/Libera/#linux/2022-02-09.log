[05:21:38] <ayecee> akik: either incorrect address or no irc server on that port
[05:21:41] <kurahaupo> diamondo: it's important to understand that the VT console, like every other terminal and terminal emulator, receives a stream of bytes that mostly characters to print using the "current" colours and attributes. When you "change colour" by sending an escape sequence, that only affects text printed subsequently and until the next escape sequence that changes the current colour.
[05:22:09] <keir> akik: is this weechat?
[05:22:13] <kurahaupo> diamondo: it's the order that the text is printed, not its location on the screen, that determines its colour.

[05:23:10] <mlu> you can change the color definitions, etc.
[05:23:26] <guest29292> ivcz on the install file?
[05:23:26] <mlu> there should be a default foreground color that you can specify -- good luck
[05:23:26] <znf> just run a basic WM already with a framebuffer
[05:23:42] <mlu> hey, the framebuffer is plenty powerful: it's fun to play with it
[05:23:50] <znf> why are you subjecting yourself to a tty?
[05:23:56] <mlu> add a nice background, etc. -- it's simple and there, so why not?

[07:34:35] <znf> If you're not familiar - as I said before - IPMI (or iKVM, or KVM over IP, or BMC, or iLo, iDRAC etc) is usually a separate chip in the mainboard, often with it's own ethernet port (but not required), that allows you to control the system like you'd be in front of it
[07:35:00] <znf> You can enter it's BIOS/EFI, you can attach a "virtual" USB drive, virtual cd-rom (ie: mount an ISO), all remotely

[08:57:43] <Lebela> hi
[08:59:08] <Lebela> I asked a question in the #ffmpeg channel,  but the channel isn't that much frequented by people, so I will also ask here
[08:59:13] <Lebela> this is my question:
[08:59:15] <Lebela> https://dpaste.org/erFx/raw
[08:59:21] * mlu is too lazy to click
[08:59:25] <Lebela> hashtags are:  ffmpeg  and  animationmaker
[08:59:56] <sheep> can you ask the question here in one message? There's a common spam attack where people post a link on IRC that is some spam and not actually the question they're asking
[09:00:13] <mlu> Lebela: sounds like you might need to get more precise about the frames and reencoding
[09:00:22] <Lebela> sheep, that is a dpaste link to a raw (text) output...
[09:00:34] <Lebela> mlu, both have 30 fps
[09:00:35] <mlu> Lebela: what command are you using to concatenate your clips?
[09:00:48] <Lebela> one moment
[09:01:28] <Lebela> ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i videos.txt -c copy merged.mp4
[09:01:44] <Lebela> the file "videos.txt"  contains the names of the files, lead by file '  and ended with '
[09:01:52] <Lebela> *led
[09:02:26] *** Joins: ackyshake (~ackyshake@user/ackyshake)
[09:04:30] <Lebela> mlu, I just confirmed it, and it seems to be the very official way ffmpeg suggests it:   https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Concatenate
[09:04:43] <mlu> Lebela: ah, yeah -- that won't work nice
[09:04:48] *** Quits: ncuxo (~Ident@87.121.71.46) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:04:58] <Lebela> why not?  That's how I've always done it
[09:05:14] <Lebela> it's the first time I am getting into trouble,  and _only_ with the moviemaker outro
[09:05:19] <mlu> Lebela: you see, the specs may be different and the starting and ending bits may be off -- you really need to get down to each frame and make sure that they're a continuous stream
[09:05:20] *** Joins: VIA (~hummus@user/VIA)
[09:05:28] <Lebela> *animationmaker
[09:05:50] <mlu> Lebela: the outro may have some extra content up front or the previous video may have some padding towards the end
[09:06:30] <Lebela> let me rephrase it in my own words what my brain makes of this information:
[09:06:39] *** Joins: unz3r0 (~unz3r0@dynamic-077-001-170-189.77.1.pool.telefonica.de)
[09:06:47] <Lebela> 1) take the video from "animationmaker" and use ffmpeg to split it into every single frame as BMP
[09:06:56] <Lebela> 2) use ffmpeg to create a NEW video out of ALL the frames
[09:07:01] <Lebela> 3) concatenate the usual way
[09:07:05] <Lebela> is this the solution?
[09:07:10] *** Joins: bigRoo (~user@73.181.dsl.syd.iprimus.net.au)
[09:07:15] <mlu> 1/2 will do it quite nicely :)
[09:07:26] <Lebela> what does 1/2 mean?
[09:07:31] <mlu> but make sure your input is lossless to begin with
[09:07:32] <Lebela> 1 divided by 2,  or 1 or 2 ?
[09:07:35] <mlu> combination of 1 and 2
[09:08:25] *** Joins: trbp (~trbp@user/trbp)
[09:08:25] <Lebela> PNG would be lossless, right?
[09:08:34] <mlu> generally, yes
[09:08:38] <Lebela> the internet has taught me that BMP seems to be what ffmpeg is using
[09:08:49] <mlu> b ut your input videos: they may have already been compressed to begin with
[09:08:51] <Lebela> but I have never used BMP myself,  not sure if BMP or PNG wuld be ideal here
[09:09:01] <mlu> doesn't really matter: theyr'e all bitmaps at the end of the day
[09:09:43] *** Joins: mexen (uid495612@user/mexen)
[09:09:43] <mlu> the important bit, though, is if you start with a lossy source (i.e. mp4) and you re-encode, you will lose some data along the way

[12:56:01] <gry> I do not know about other distributions, I can tell you only about debian. It offers you two options in the installer: a rather minimal install without any gui, or a pre-installed desktop like xfce/gnome/etc. So 'doing the minimal install, then installing a wm' would do approximately the same thing. (The 'task-xfce' package, for example, includes xfwm, a set of xfce utilities, and a set of apps which the xfce desktop works well with.)
[12:56:46] <gry> So when you do a minimal install, and then you install a wm, you have around a few dozens of wms to choose from. Not all of them come with a set of applications curated for that wm.

[17:57:28] <mlu> even the Sn100e solder melts at 227degC

[17:58:08] <hexnewbie> You add SSD cache to deal with a critical performance bug, marketing decides to sell this as “SSD storage”. You run certbot to issue your domain a TLS certificate, your supervisor insists you add ‘certified to do web sites’ to your résumé.

[20:38:00] <SaltHillStroller> When you say less time-sensitive tasks, what are you referring to? My current vision, is a long lived thread that queries data from my device and buffers it in Kernel space. Periodically, the userspace daemon will query the device file for data

[20:38:22] <ayecee> SaltHillStroller: ah, that part sounds more like a daemon.
[20:38:56] <ayecee> SaltHillStroller: the daemon would be a long lived program that queries the device and stores data to a file, and responds to userspace requests for that data.

[20:39:37] <ayecee> storing data to files from within kernelspace is a hassle.
[20:40:08] <SaltHillStroller> ayecee: The daemon also living in kernelspace presumably? That's essentially what I have currently. However reading the documentation writing to file in kernelspace is really frowned upon. Hence I thought a device file would be useful for transferring the data to userspace
[20:40:16] <ayecee> no, the daemon is userspace
[20:41:05] <ayecee> it would query the device using the device file

[22:27:05] <Guest69> Can I install linux without a USB stick? I have this fresh 512GB SSD, an ancient archlinux running off a usb stick, and a downloaded ubuntu iso.

[22:27:47] *** Joins: Cold_Cat (~Cold_Cat@92.sub-174-247-224.myvzw.com)
[22:28:00] <Guest69> because that's what the archlinux is running on, so if i make a mistake that's bad.
[22:28:25] <znf> You can install Linux in many ways, depending on what distribution you choose.
[22:28:45] <alkisg> Guest69: dd the archlinux into the disk to use it as fallback, then create a proper usb stick
[22:28:50] <alkisg> I.e. just dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda
[22:29:03] <znf> But having limited physical media available will be a bit of a challenge, depending on your skillset
[22:29:05] <AeroNotix> alkisg: telling a newbie to use dd, it's a bold strategy
[22:29:05] <ayecee> Guest69: you can burn it to a cdrom, or write it to a second usb stick, or directly to an ssd or hdd, but not the one you want to install to.
[22:29:25] <znf> And, no offence - but if you are asking that question, your skillset may be lacking in this case
[22:29:41] <ayecee> probably coulda found a different way to phrase that eh

[23:57:27] <znf> can you compile a kernel without tcp/ip support?
[23:57:45] <ron1w> like six years asking if slackware is dead
[23:57:57] <hexnewbie> ron1w: Um, sorry, we played a little prank on you. Placed you in a time machine while you're slept, it's 9th now
