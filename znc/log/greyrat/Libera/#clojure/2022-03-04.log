[22:10:27] <sobel> cpython is usually used to distinguish python from pypy
[22:11:21] <selfsymmetric-mu> And yet the most important skill for interviewing is banging out minimally viable solutions in Python.
[22:12:01] <selfsymmetric-mu> Still the flakiest part of the interview for me. I should consider applying for senior-er roles.
[22:12:08] <sobel> they do love that minimum
[22:12:18] <sobel> minimum-viable-crap
[22:12:51] <tatsumaru> selfsymmetric-mu: just start your own company
[22:12:51] <selfsymmetric-mu> I have to keep a checklist. Eat a sandwich before the interview, read and understand the problem, come up with a solution, code it, improve it. In that order.
[22:13:25] <selfsymmetric-mu> tatsumaru: What do you think are necessary skills and personality traits for a technical founder?
[22:14:19] <sobel> if someone wants to interview me right, they should ask for a walk-through of whatever-the-hell is relevant to them. i tend to know my shit from a presentation standpoint and the best measure of success is confident interactions in the subject matter.
[22:15:03] <sobel> best hires i've made were on that basis. if they think they know stuff, i'm not here to second-guess that. i'm here to see if they are ready to deploy.
[22:17:43] <selfsymmetric-mu> I do the same thing in my own interviews. I main look for the presence of nuanced opinions. Not saying I know the silver bullet for interviewing, mind you.
[22:18:18] <tatsumaru> selfsymmetric-mu: a mild form of asperger's is quite helpful, it inhibits picking up on all these social cues that discourage you from pursuing creative original ideas. in terms of myers-briggs, I think INTJ is probably optimal for technical founders. other than that - thinking for yourself, systems thinking, complex coordination and all-around thirst for curiosity and worldly knowledge.

[22:18:56] <jeaye> We use CLJS on the FE and CLJ somewhere in the middle.
[22:19:30] <selfsymmetric-mu> jeaye: I've only written one Go program, a port of my Newtonian pathfinder. Other than that I've made some edits to my last job's routing pipeline, and read a bit of terrible, terrible, kubernetes-helm source code. I have accepted an offer two weeks ago, however.
[22:19:45] <selfsymmetric-mu> A Haskell gig, for what it's worth. Some Nix.
[22:20:20] <jeaye> Congrats!
[22:20:25] <selfsymmetric-mu> jeaye: Thank you!!
[22:20:27] <sobel> the magic bullet is looking for something *good* rather than looking for knockout criteria
[22:20:53] <sobel> it's not even a coding thing. it's just a people thing.
[22:21:03] <jeaye> Nix and Haskell is quite the progressive gig.
[22:21:12] <jeaye> Or s/progressive/academic/
[22:21:43] <selfsymmetric-mu> tatsumaru: I have the complex coordination down, as well as the all-round thirst for worldly knowledge, but I do think I'm prone to social discouragement.
[22:21:56] <ridcully_> so you are using cljc all the way, but you need a go dev?
[22:22:44] <selfsymmetric-mu> tatsumaru: For all the criticisms of MNTJ I do like it as a crude personality-binning method. I score as an ENTJ, almost INTJ.

[22:23:43] <sobel> I used to score/identify INTJ all the time but eventually I figured out that (for me) it's symptomatic of not spending enough time in the woods with my car 100% parked for at least 3-5 days in a row.
[22:23:47] <selfsymmetric-mu> jeaye: It is. My last job was Haskell, I use NixOS, they came highly recommended as an organization, and they paid better.
[22:24:04] * jeaye uses NixOS as well.
[22:24:21] <sobel> i should probably join that party
[22:24:22] <jeaye> Since 2015.
[22:26:47] <selfsymmetric-mu> Since 2019 for me. Nix is an awful language but NixOS is the only OS doing declarative builds, except Guix but I need too many unfree packages.
[22:27:15] <tatsumaru> selfsymmetric-mu: you can probably make it if you figure out a way to protect your creativity from the voices of mass insanity. it's a learnable skill. i am thinking about sponsoring some research on people with asperger's and possibly patenting a drug which intermittently induces mild asperger's as a defense against noise. I will call it Authentil.
[22:27:16] <jeaye> I was just in the middle of trying to phrase how much I despise Nix expressions.
[22:27:49] <jeaye> I've considered, multiple times, writing a Clojure DSL which generates Nix instead.
[22:28:10] <technomancy> surely a sexp->nix compiler has been done
[22:28:39] <technomancy> or I guess maybe that would just be guix
[22:29:15] <jeaye> I said Clojure, not sexp. Guix is a lot better, thanks to Scheme, but it's still Scheme.
[22:32:11] <jeaye> A lot of Clojure folks enjoy others lisps and schemes. For me, they all feel archaic.
[22:35:57] <Para> The whole Myers-Briggs is thankfully vaporwave, as it was taken context by its creator almost immediately and she couldn't run fast enough behind the feelgood wave to warn that it shouldn't be taken seriously.
[22:36:13] <Para> ...vaporware, as vaporvawe it'd be kinda pleasant, actually.
[22:36:36] <technomancy> yeah it's 100% a scam to sell books and management courses
[22:36:38] <Para> also: python is at least better than shell that hasn't been updated since 2011
[22:36:58] <tatsumaru> not really, it's quite useful, it's based on Jungian archetypes.
[22:37:07] <sobel> Para: i consider MBT measurements like thermometer readings
[22:37:08] <technomancy> it happens to fit certain people's self-descriptions well so they extrapolate and think it can be used to describe anyone

[22:37:25] <technomancy> tatsumaru: same thing
[22:37:35] <Para> tatsumaru: Jung's theories are seen these days as a necessary misstep in general progression, so it's still trash :)
[22:37:56] <sobel> they aren't types in the sense that most of us consider types to be at least somewhat static
[22:37:57] <Para> Same goes for Freud. But that's just how science works.
[22:38:14] <tatsumaru> Para: no need to appeal to authority, you can think for yourself
[22:38:18] <sobel> drop me in the right scene and i'm ENFP
[22:39:25] <sobel> i don't think the authorities are that interested in Para ;)
[22:39:50] <tatsumaru> it's probably the other way around
[22:40:03] <sobel> not that i've seen
[22:40:06] <Para> My two cents is that the fast/slow mind thing seems to be real and some are primed to start with slow/analytic while others go in from the fast/impulsive end. Everyone waves around.
[22:40:59] <sobel> that sounds way more descriptive of reality to me
[22:44:12] <tatsumaru> must be how it is then.

[23:08:23] <Para> I think someone in the past did mention running Clojure in an EAR.
[23:08:39] <technomancy> I think using a .war file was considered very old-fashioned back in 2014
[23:08:43] <leah2> i agree
[23:08:54] <leah2> but it could be good in a usecase i have currently
[23:09:02] <Para> Imagine Clojure deployed as WAR, and within it as an OSGi module.
[23:09:25] <leah2> would be nice to see some existing wildfly or tomcat setup, else i need to figure out everything from scratch
[23:11:14] <Para> Hmm, it shouldn't be that difficult. Jetty runs in tomcat at least natively with ease, and I'd imagine pedestal handlers are based on servlets. And even if they weren't, it can't be that hard to dig up ring a bit to make an adapter. Hmmmm.
[23:11:48] <Para> in fact https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/tree/master/ring-servlet
[23:11:49] <leah2> i think ring can do servlet w/o jetty?
[23:11:54] <leah2> but i dont have much clue tbh :)
[23:12:02] <Para> Looks like so :)
[23:12:34] <Para> There's `lein ring uberwar` apparently.
[23:12:48] <leah2> except we use pedestal, but i think that can do servlet too
[23:13:04] <Para> That sounds almost as good as Finno-Korean Hyperwar.
[23:13:13] <leah2> :p
[23:14:37] <leah2> i'm just not sure how the tomcat classloader interacts with the clojure one?
[23:14:55] <Para> The base classloader will be URLClassLoader IIRC.
[23:15:15] <Para> Clojure's own classloader is strictly incompatible with it, so it depends on ordering.
[23:15:25] <Para> (this is also why Clojure cannot be run on Azure Functions properly)
[23:18:10] <leah2> >  however, bear in mind that in order to implement this functionality, Tomcat must periodically check the modification time on every servlet. This entails a lot of filesystem activity
[23:18:15] * leah2 looks at age of book
[23:18:26] <leah2> > October 2007
[23:19:00] <Para> Back then a 7200rpm hard disk was premium.
[23:19:21] <leah2> even in 2007 file systems had buffers :p
[23:19:56] <leah2> or do people write things with 1000 servlets
[23:20:06] <Para> The job I had back in 2008 made a lot of its shock and awe from caching all rendered HTML.
[23:20:15] <Para> "How is your system so fast!?!"
[23:20:32] <leah2> well caching in front is still reasonable in 2022
[23:21:07] <Para> I've actually started slowly leaning back to backend rendering again.
[23:21:25] <Para> And jquery.
[23:21:31] <leah2> i'm so deep in the backend i dont even know this works
[23:21:38] <leah2> but i fixed jquery code for money in 2021 :p
[23:22:10] <Para> jquery is still maintained and it's kinda fun that its #1 selling point is still the small size, it's only 30kB
[23:22:20] <Para> That's less than most favicons these days.
[23:22:32] <leah2> preact is only 3k :p
[23:23:05] <leah2> and since browsers have Document.querySelector, it's quite bearable to write vanilla js
