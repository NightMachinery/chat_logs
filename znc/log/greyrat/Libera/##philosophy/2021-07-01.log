[00:43:44] <krb> i believe that if there would be a choice in anything, we would also have to be some kind of gods that was able to move beyond the "laws" of the universe, and also make choices in a sort of universe of our own. and that we in that other universe was able to make a decision based on eternal reasoning

[00:54:36] <krb> how can we claim we have actual choices
[00:54:53] <raincomplex> what is an actual choice?
[00:55:16] <Parf> it's a good question, usually people opt for either some sort of soft determinism and don't think about it too hard
[00:56:10] <Parf> really, i've wondered as well. i think we're all part of some pattern, but it emerges from the motions of the universe itself, so we're deterministic, but effectively we have choice since we are the "vehicles" of the universe
[00:56:15] <kmh> krb, isn't that obvious?
[00:56:37] <krb> i think when it's the evolved concept called social-interaction program a entity to delude itself to be a "i" individual and that "i" lives" through a "life" that program it in certain ways where it delude itself to think it had a "choice"
[00:56:38] <kmh> krb, the lees you understand the easier it is to claim
[00:56:54] <Parf> we are a sequence, it appears, but there also appears to be some slight sway one has. not direct control, but several tugs at the wheel can have some effect
[00:57:38] <Parf> it's also entirely possible our understanding is so limited that we're not even framing the question properly at all

[01:39:18] <Parf> i think he had a myopic view of quantum physics, as did some of the citizens who contributed to its then meaning. but it's been almost a hundred years since that page has been written

[01:42:27] <Beyondo> Suppposedly, one reason Einstein didn't like quantum mechanics
[01:42:29] <Beyondo> was that it
[01:42:37] <Beyondo> proposed random actions
[01:42:46] <Parf> spooky action at a distance
[01:42:56] <Beyondo> and he believed the universe is deterministic
[01:42:58] <Parf> it was the interrelation of seemingly disconnected objects
[01:43:08] <Beyondo> I think he didn't like the meaninglessness of randomosity
[01:43:08] <Parf> in any case, seemingly, he was wrong.
[01:43:23] <Beyondo> but I think, like everyone else, he was looking at randomosity wrong

[03:51:20] <raincomplex> i've tried to understand bell's theorem a couple times but i remain unconvinced
[03:52:58] <raincomplex> it feels very slippery
[04:05:27] <Parf> well, the point of all this is that it misses the predictive nature of quantum mechanics, and the fact that it works isn't even a question to einstein. he appears to be caught up in the idea of nonlocality
[04:08:24] <Parf> "Einstein argued that the hidden variables should obey the condition of locality" this was his hinging argument, and this appears to be bell's response. "In 1964, John Stewart Bell proposed his now famous theorem, which states that no physical theory of hidden local variables can ever reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics. Implicit in the theorem is the proposition that the determinism of classical physics is fundamentally incapable of describing
[04:08:24] <Parf> quantum mechanics" which to me only means that the language has changed, and likewise, the question.
[04:09:40] <Parf> by ruling out all the things that it can't be, you rule out a all of the "hidden variables"
[04:12:00] <Parf> in fact, one of the examples i posted earlier is a physical bell's test
[04:14:58] <Parf> https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10316.pdf "Here, we show operation of a fully functional three-qubit array in silicon and generation of a three-qubit Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state" which was just recently released in a paper here in 2021, the GHZ being important for: "The GHZ state leads to striking non-classical correlations (1989). Particles prepared in this state lead to a version of Bell's theorem, which shows the internal inconsistency of
[04:14:58] <Parf> the notion of elements-of-reality introduced in the famous Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen article."
[04:15:32] <Parf> hardly slippery when it's being functionally proven even here in 2021

[14:42:15] <TechTest> oh
[14:42:36] <TechTest> hope she'll be well :)
[14:42:44] <arryana> to be fair, she was never much interested in human food even before that
[14:42:49] <TechTest> mines are on a restrictive diet but only for weight loss
[14:43:12] <arryana> last test she was up to 60% function, which apparently isn't appalling for a 14 year old cat
[14:43:32] <arryana> she needs a more current test, but with the zombie apocalypse, there have been difficulties with that
[14:44:28] <arryana> she's still taking flying leaps off tables to land on the dogs, so i figure she's okay
[14:47:38] <TechTest> do you give her IV?
[14:48:09] <TechTest> I sometimes pet sit for a cat with kidney damage who takes IV and he has been doing a lot better since
[14:51:15] <arryana> no, she doesn't need any support

[16:18:09] <arryana> i don't really look at it that way

[16:20:59] <spruit11> how are wolves? I know they're social and I think more timid than dogs but that's about it
[16:21:04] <arryana> more yes than no, though the line is blurring for me somewhat, as i have been raising the shepherds as if they were wolves.
[16:21:18] <arryana> i wouldn't say they're more timid.  they are more cautious.
[16:21:33] <arryana> i had cats with the wolves too
[16:21:34] <softpaw> ok thx interesting
[16:21:40] <TechTest> arryana: do you mean actual wolves or the wolf breed?
[16:21:52] <arryana> the biggest difference is that to a dog, humans win because we're human
[16:22:04] <arryana> to a wolf, we're just wolves that don't see well, don't hear well, and don't run fast
[16:22:24] <pussipupu> don't scent well neither

[16:33:06] <TechTest> grammatically speaking?
[16:34:04] <softpaw> hehe George Carlin summing it up well ^
[16:34:17] <arryana> as a statement of fact.  it isn't true.
[16:34:51] <arryana> there is no media anywhere on the planet advising such
[16:34:58] <TechTest> well, many people do think that
[16:35:04] <arryana> no they don't
[16:35:09] <arryana> show me one.
[16:35:28] <TechTest> I could call my father for you
[16:35:37] <TechTest> but I don't want to hear him

[16:36:20] *** Joins: krb (~krb@80.232.98.53)
[16:36:28] <arryana> i very much doubt he believes it can be transmitted through an open window
[16:37:37] * arryana is not a fan of histrionic overstatement
[16:38:14] <TechTest> he used to think that
[16:38:18] <TechTest> now he got a vaccine
[16:39:07] <TechTest> anyways, there's wouldn't be much value in that conversation
[16:39:18] <softpaw> i think
[16:39:18] <softpaw> overuse of antibiotics causing new mutant strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria
[16:39:18] <softpaw> is analogous to
[16:39:18] <softpaw> overuse of vaccine causing new mutant strains of vaccine resistant bacteria
[16:39:26] <softpaw> i hope im wrong tho
[16:40:10] <softpaw> could that be why we seeing all these new strains sees pretty obvious to me
[16:40:24] <TechTest> there haven't been any new vaccines the last few years
[16:40:35] <TechTest> it's time to start producing vaccines again
[16:40:38] <TechTest> because $$$
[16:41:42] <softpaw> i hope im wrong and not a consiracy advocate but its seems just like that
[16:42:09] <arryana> what do you mean there haven't been any new vaccines?
[16:42:15] <arryana> how about ebola?
[16:42:26] <softpaw> it looks like an engineered corporate pharma multi billion $ scam
[16:43:20] <softpaw> engineer virus then make vaccines to cause mutant strains necessitating more vaccine repeat ad finitum
[16:43:24] <TechTest> Ebola was far away, so we didn't care
[16:43:46] <TechTest> same way we don't care about the fact 20.000 people/day die from hunger
[16:43:57] <arryana> uh, they developed a vaccine, at least a start at one
[16:44:07] <arryana> your statement that there are no new vaccines is fallacious
[16:44:11] <softpaw> or in my county 1 person die of cancer every hour
[16:44:21] <TechTest> because they are not dying here
[16:44:23] <arryana> cancer is not a simple mechanism
[16:44:29] <arryana> it isn't relatable

[17:05:26] <pussipupu> We're seeing new strains primarily in areas with low vaccination rates, because more transmission means more opportunity for mutagen mutagenesis
[17:05:48] <pussipupu> Well, with high infection rates, but that's related to low vaccination rates of course
[17:07:39] <arryana> yeah
[17:08:03] <arryana> here the vaccine uptake is high, but so is transmission
[17:08:18] <arryana> fortunately, hospitalizations haven't gone critical
[17:09:27] <softpaw> i know they told us antibiotics were good idea now we know there were not
[17:09:27] <softpaw> its more of a trust issue for me, i simply dont trust corporate medicine
[17:09:29] <pussipupu> Yeah, infections for vaccinated people seem much less severe
[17:10:07] <arryana> that's gonna have to be a personal thing.  i'm old enough to have known people who had polio.

[17:11:03] <arryana> the fact that everyone i knew with polio is ten years dead is more reason -for- vaccines, in my mind
[17:11:14] <softpaw> my point is everything is both case and dose dependant
[17:11:29] <arryana> life doesn't come with guarantees, it's not scripted.
[17:11:43] <arryana> when something novel happens, all anyone can do is the best they know at the time
[17:11:48] <arryana> including scientists.
[17:12:04] <softpaw> they do not test any intervention for optimal dose or type of medicine
[17:12:17] <softpaw> i mean muscle testing

[17:14:38] <pussipupu> I have no idea what you're trying to express
[17:15:55] <softpaw> basically anything u ingest should be tested using a Applied kinesiology technique to test for suitability and dose
[17:16:52] <softpaw> even if u think its good for you like an orange for vitamin c everything is dose dependant
[17:17:00] <softpaw> hormesis
[17:17:18] <softpaw> even toxic things are good for you

[20:37:40] <TechTest> chronometer says I need 3500 calories a day
[20:37:46] <TechTest> that's a lot of food
[20:37:57] <Panther> Flatiron steaks are nice :)
[20:38:06] <TechTest> and therefore a lot of cooking
[20:38:26] * Panther nods
[20:38:38] <Panther> Yes, you can certainly make the problem seem insurmountable.
[20:39:09] <TechTest> yes I've been doing that for very long
[20:39:15] * Panther smiles
[20:39:24] <Panther> Then you are prolly good at it. :)
[20:39:37] <TechTest> I gained some weight, but unfortunately these days I've pretty must lost what I've gained
[20:41:19] <Panther> Because it is a way of life, not a line to cross and be done with it.
[20:42:40] <TechTest> it's just that dietiting always focus on loosing weight because many people are overweight
[20:42:49] <TechTest> no one talks about gaining weight
[20:43:05] <TechTest> and gaining weight is a lot harder than loosing weight
[20:43:54] <Panther> It can be done.
[20:44:05] * Panther hasta split now before the storm comes.
[20:44:08] * Panther waves
[20:44:21] <TechTest> it can, but it's not easy
[20:44:31] <TechTest> people be like "just eat"
[20:44:41] <Panther> It is easy if you do it the right way, and that is not it.
[20:44:48] <TechTest> though if you are overweight they'll give you like 100 tips on how to lose weight
[20:44:55] <krb> what's you guys favorite foods?
[20:45:13] <TechTest> if you are underweight the only tip is "just eat"
[20:46:07] <krb> helps with lots of butter and sugar in things
[20:46:47] <krb> make things more tasty
[20:46:50] <TechTest> that's how I managed to gain weight, eating pizza and sugar
[20:47:13] <TechTest> then blood pressure hit big numbers
[20:48:20] <krb> i've heard some loose weight just by eating bacon and eggs
[20:49:08] <TechTest> yes that's me

[21:08:59] <plankers> if you want to gain weight lift weights
[21:09:16] <plankers> your metabolism will take care of the rest
[21:12:35] <TechTest> that's true
[21:12:54] <TechTest> I've been postponing going to the pool for like 1 month

[21:51:16] <kmh> pussipupu,  pretty much every industry does pseudoscience (as well)
[21:52:12] <kmh> pussipupu, essentially anytime science potentially conflicts with their profit goals (or agenda) an industry switches to pseudoscience
[21:53:14] <pussipupu> you'll notice I said "industry" not some specific one
[21:54:22] <kmh> i'm just suggesting instead of compiling a long list you might simply write down all
[21:59:01] <pussipupu> I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean
[21:59:20] <pussipupu> Also I'm full of delicious Vietnamese food and pie
[22:02:01] <pussipupu> I wasn't planning to make a list of instances of pseudoscientific behaviour or guilty parties though
[22:06:09] <Panther> Might you do it if you weren't full of delicious Vietnamese food and pie?
[22:06:35] <pussipupu> No, doesn't sound very worthwhile
[22:10:51] <Panther> Probably not
[22:11:49] <Panther> Then again, there might come a time when you wail and bemoan not having created it.
