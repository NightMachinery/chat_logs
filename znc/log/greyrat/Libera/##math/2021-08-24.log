[01:34:08] <Z-module> river, I think you're new enough here not to have seen me mention this before. This Russian guy Zudulin published a paper proving that at least one of zeta(5), zeta(7), zeta(9), zeta(11), zeta(13), zeta(15), zeta(17), zeta(19) is irrational.  Then shortly later, he published another one showing that at least one of those first four numbers is irrational. Good thing he did those in that order.
[01:34:53] <river> yeah I know of that result, pretty incredible

[05:25:39] <moon-child> well, you haven't specified the domain of your exponent.  I assumed it was integral.  In that case 7 is also 2^2.8 or so

[05:28:54] <AMDG> Contrived and somewhat arbitrary, yes, but it's for a good cause, I promise :)
[05:29:09] <moon-child> so, sum or difference of up to two natural powers of two
[05:29:18] <AMDG> Yes
[05:29:43] <AMDG> And if my hypothesis is false, how many values in a given range can be represented this way?

[05:31:22] <AMDG> And for values such as 11 and 35, the answer isn't immediately obvious especially given that we allow sum and difference.
[05:31:50] <moon-child> why is that?
[05:32:03] <AMDG> For all we know, it has some outrageously large set of two powers of two that manages to sum to 11 or 35.
[05:32:17] <moon-child> how could that be?
[05:32:35] <moon-child> the difference between successive powers of two gets larger and larger
[05:32:58] <AMDG> Yes, but the gap closes with negative powers of two.

[08:22:21] <Fangs> its a group when a =/= 0 and a connected group when a > 0
[08:22:46] <qergle> greenbagels: yeah, i think d is sometimes used, at least wiki says so.
[08:22:53] <greenbagels> does connected group mean the set is also a connected top. space?
[08:23:01] <Fangs> that's what I meant
[08:23:17] <greenbagels> with the topology somehow compatible with the group structure in some way idk
[08:23:42] <greenbagels> i dont know about topological groups
[08:23:51] <Fangs> its the set of translations in R, together with (invertible) scalar multiplication in R, so R*.. so the group is actually R x| R*
[08:24:05] <Fangs> more generally you can have R^n x| GL(n,R)
[08:24:12] <qergle> maybe barravince should rename his function A(m,n), the number of numbers from 1 to m that are divisible by n.
[08:24:25] <Fangs> its called the eucledean group apparently

[08:34:41] <Guest24> https://i.imgur.com/y0HJ6Qe.png for this one, the slope of the tangent line to the curve is given by: slope = lim_(h->0) (f(4+h) - f(4))/(h), right ?
[08:35:53] <qergle> Guest24: yes
[08:36:35] <Fangs> orange is the original set of points.. so g = (s,t) and points are (x,y), blue is g(x,y) and red is g(x,y)g^{-1}
[08:36:55] <Fangs> sliding s and t just changes which element of the group you're multiplying by
[08:37:06] <Guest24> by the function f they mean the "y" in y = 2+1/x, right?
[08:37:12] <qergle> yes
[08:37:25] <Guest24> thats easy then
[08:37:39] <qergle> in this case f(x)=2+1/x
[08:37:49] <Guest24> yea

[08:37:57] *** Joins: mbuf (~Shakthi@122.178.232.166)
[08:39:13] <Guest24> so doing the limit, f(4+h) means 2+1/(4+h) and f(4) = 2+1/4 = 5/2. Then we have: lim_(h->0) (2 + 1/(4+h) - 5/2)/h
[08:39:50] <qergle> i don't think so
[08:40:14] <qergle> f(4) should be 9/4 no?
[08:40:36] <Guest24> whoops
[08:41:27] <Guest24> but the fraction still doesn't simplify to eliminate the 'h' variable
[08:41:33] <qergle> it should
[08:41:46] <Guest24> ok i will try again
[08:41:56] <qergle> just consider the numerator, (2+1/(4+h)-9/4)
[08:42:45] <qergle> find an lcd, combine, and you should get some joy
[08:45:11] <Guest24> that simplifies to: -h / (16+4h). Then with the denominator of h, the top 'h' gets cancelled. Then since h->0 the 4*h term vanishes and we are left with: -1/4
[08:45:18] <Guest24> er, -1/16
[08:45:27] <qergle> looks good
[08:47:03] <qergle> and we can validate our limit, by taking the derivative of f(x)=2+1/x -> f'(x)=-1/x² -> f'(4)=-1/16

[09:04:24] <greenbagels> i guess that's kind of too vague to be a useful statement, sorry, let me rephrase

[13:53:50] <cadmio> the text uses D_8. But before applying the theorem I'd like to understand the problem from a combinatorics point of view
[13:57:23] <W> Three of one colour specifically has some conveniences that lets you get away without all this group theory; any of the gaps between them can be swapped. So you have eight red pearls to distribute in three interchangeable bins, which is small enough you can enumerate on paper; 8-0-0,7-1-0,6-2-0,6-1-1,5-3-0,5-2-1,4-4-0,4-3-1,4-2-2,3-3-2, ten bracelets
[14:00:05] <cadmio> so if I rotate the pearls in the bracelet that would be consider the same one, right?
[14:00:09] <W> (obviously counterproductive to your course, but I'm the kind of guy who would complain about the exercise not using larger numbers if that wasn't what they wanted you to do)
[14:00:25] <greenbagels> cadmio: yes

[14:07:01] <greenbagels> but take 4 of each color pearl for example; the bracelets corrseponding to RBRBRBRB and BRBRBRBR are the only two bracelets obtainable by rotations / reflections

[14:08:51] <greenbagels> i feel like im explaining this poorly
[14:09:26] <cadmio> for each combination there should be a certain number of equal arrangements that you could subtract from the binom
[14:09:32] <int-e> greenbagels: you're also forgetting about the rotations of BBRRBBRR
[14:09:48] <int-e> or maybe... oh... I get what angle you're coming from, I think
[14:10:13] <greenbagels> yeah i meant like, for any given final arrangement, there are not necessarily 7 other duplicate arrangements you've counted
[14:10:17] <river> burnsides theorem is |X/G| = 1/|G| Sum_{g in G} |X^g|
[14:10:27] <int-e> In either case, the point is, though, that not all strings with 4 Bs and 4 Rs have 8 distinct rotations.
[14:10:32] <greenbagels> BRBRBRBR only has 1 other duplicate (RBRBRBRB)

[20:13:51] <sg1> Hi. Sin and Tan have very identical value near 0 and other critical points. Is this being leveraged somewhere? E.g.: sin(0.2) ≈ tan(0.2) = 0.2027100355086725, i.e.: up to 16th place after dot…
[20:14:38] <river> its because their derivative at 0 is 1

[20:51:31] <sg1> also, far away from 0 but at the 0 points the values are still similar, though opposite in sign, e.g.: sin(3.1) + tan(3.1) = -0.000035
[20:52:20] <river> sg1, these functions are periodic
[20:52:20] <sg1> they alternate between the same and different sign
[20:52:30] <river> sin(x + 2pi) = sin(x)
[20:52:36] <river> tan(x + 2pi) = tan(x)
[20:52:36] <sg1> river: true…

[20:53:10] <cherim> What has happened to the QFT reading group idea?
[20:53:15] <river> you can see on the graph here, how similar they are at 0, 2pi, etc.
[20:53:29] <river> but they are very different around pi/4
[20:53:40] <river> sorry pi/2
[20:53:41] <river> btw
[20:53:48] <sg1> river: yes, you're of course right
[20:53:55] <river> it is interesting to look at how they are equal at pi
[20:54:01] <river> but they are not approximating each other at pi
[20:54:06] <river> because sin is going down, tan is going up
[20:54:17] <river> oh this is exactly what you just said
[20:54:51] <int-e> sin(x + pi) = -sin(x), tan(x + pi) = tan(x) <-- this explains the opposite signs.

[21:35:52] <drobi_> savask: for my function Descartes is inconclusive and Mathematica isn't able to compute the Sturm sequence (and it would take too long for me). Regardless, showing when the expressions of sturm are positive or negative would probably be too hard to begin with. I was hoping there might be quartic specific methods that would simplify the algebra
[21:37:08] <drobi_> my function is really f(a, b, x) but i'm interested in the value of x when f = 0.
[21:38:18] <savask> drobi_: So it's an abstract expression and the answer will depend on a and b?
[21:39:23] <drobi_> savask: yes, Descartes works for almost all values of a and b, but is inconclusive for some bounded range of values. I want to show that there are no negative real roots to prove a result
[21:40:12] <savask> drobi_: Hmm, maybe you can show that the minimum of your function on (-inf, 0) is greater than 0, or something
[21:40:44] <savask> The derivative is a cubic, but perhaps in your case it simplifies to something

[23:27:00] <Z-module> of what?
[23:27:08] <barravince> of any given sequence defined in R
[23:27:48] <Z-module> We don't speaking of those things of a *sequence* per se. We speak of the lim sup or the lim inf of the sequence, or some the sup or inf of the *set* of distinct values of the sequence (but these are different in general from lim sup, lim inf)
[23:27:58] <Z-module> or sometimes*
[23:28:35] <Z-module> plain old sup and inf (= least upper bound, greatest lower bound) apply to bounded nonempty sets of reals.
[23:28:39] <Z-module> That's a different thing from sequences.
[23:29:42] <barravince> well this is what I am referring to then, not the limits, but the sup and inf of a bounded non-empty set of reals
[23:29:50] <Z-module> OK
[23:30:01] <Z-module> there still isn't really a totally general way to deal with it

[23:46:54] <arseniiv> Guest64: if Ideals, varieties, and algorithms (Cox, Little, O’Shea) is available to you, I think there should be such a definition. The book deals with affine varieties though I have read it just for a bit years ago
[23:47:27] <arseniiv> (if that’s not your book already, in which case oops)
[23:47:29] <Guest64> well, it has defined the dimension of a linear variety...
[23:47:42] <Guest64> and yeah that is the one i have
[23:47:55] <arseniiv> linear varieties are way simpler though, oh
[23:48:31] <Guest64> yeah its just what you expect straight from linear algebra. But generally, for ~affine varieties~ idk
[23:49:14] <arseniiv> I’d think one would need to go through the number of equations of the system or something, but that seems like a bad way to do it in general, as there will be many caveats, so surely the definition should be something else

[23:49:37] <arseniiv> (of the system which defines the variety in some ℝ^n)
[23:49:56] <barravince> <arseniiv> yeah i meant Priestley, it was advised on the module handbook and I took it from library and I found it quite helpful and not too overly complex
[23:51:46] <arseniiv> if we did analysis, we’d try to obtain a dimension of a tangent linear space at a point, but the point should be a good one, no cusps and self-intersections and things like that, but that would be too general and too, well, unacceptable. Affine varieties are sufficiently good to have their own specialized way to know their dimension
[23:52:11] <arseniiv> barravince: complex ;) yeah

[23:54:52] <Guest64> I am on section 1.2 of that book looking through it. Maybe they define the definition of affine varieties, generally, later?
[23:55:09] <Guest64> also, why do we use the word "variety" ?
[23:56:29] <buster> Guest64, i wondered too, it's italian for 'manifoldigkeit' (manifoldness, multiplicity), originally in the sense of the bigness of the set of solutions to an equation
