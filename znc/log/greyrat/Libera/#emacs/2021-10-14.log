[07:01:06] <rnkn> but I do much appreciate the offers to help!
[07:02:27] <rnkn> if anyone is interested in the bug, it's something with this macro call: https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode/blob/master/fountain-mode.el#L3032

[07:24:38] <technomancy> the school content protection thing blocks access to games and so they can't load tic80.com but I published some of their tic80 games to my own domain and so they just use that since it's not in the database as a banned game-related site =D
[07:24:45] <Catie> I just did a byte-compile-file and loaded the resulting .elc, no error on fountain-mode entry

[07:25:20] <Catie> I absolutely love my Chromebook! It runs FreeBSD now, is devoid of basically all features, and makes an incredible thin client
[07:25:27] <rnkn> yeah this is so weird, it must have something to do with the way package.el is byte-compiling
[07:25:58] <Catie> rnkn: does it compile the files serially? Is the order the issue for some reason?

[19:56:16] <grym> EdwardIII: yes, that's part of the game
[19:56:29] <bpalmer> for many companies, december of year X is not particularly meaningful for year X's results (all the work had to be done in advance; and it's 12 months until year X+1 's results come in), so it's a chance to breathe.

[20:19:27] <EdwardIII> it also depends what we mean by 'consult' right? if you're going in somewhere, documenting stuff, making suggestions, training, then leaving - you can really do that as 1 person

[23:48:47] <judybot> aidalgol: the importance of the “I” in the “I’m”. “I’m” is a word that is often used in a negative way.
