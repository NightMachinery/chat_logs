[12:37:42] <sorta4> so it was the firewall of azure stopping me before
[12:38:52] <sorta4> I have 21G space available, how much would you recommend setting the buffer size to Andrio ?
[12:39:22] <Andrio> By default, your buffers aren't even stored on disk. That depends more on your RAM.
[12:39:33] <sorta4> 1g ram :(
[12:39:40] <Andrio> well, that's twice what my server has.~
[12:39:47] <sorta4> :O

[12:41:03] <sorta4> woah ok
[12:42:25] <Nacorid> Yeah, buffer doesn't take much
[12:42:43] <Nacorid> I think mine sits at 10k, but solely for one active channel

[12:55:42] <sorta4> I have no idea, should i go to #weechat instead?
[12:56:02] <Nacorid> Maybe someone else knows, I've never used it
[12:56:36] <Andrio> Pretty sure you have to set a config option for it to accept a self-signed cert.
[12:56:45] <Andrio> But if you have a domain, you can get a Let's Encrypt cert.
[12:57:37] <sorta4> I do hve one actually
[12:57:41] <Nacorid> I just ticked the box in hexchat because my cert script wouldn't copy the certs correctly when run as a crontab
[12:57:43] <sorta4> i use certbot for this
[12:57:50] <sorta4> even have a cronjob to auto renew it
[12:57:58] <Andrio> Why not have your ZNC use it then?
[12:58:18] <sorta4> i can?
[12:58:19] <sorta4> how?

[12:59:38] <sorta4> thank you 
[13:03:46] <sorta4> i should add these options in ~/.znc/configs/znc.conf right?
[13:04:53] <sorta4> can't i add this stuff from the web interface??

[13:08:53] <Nacorid> You shouldn't start znc as root, and if it's not root it can't read the certificate of your website
[13:09:14] <Nacorid> Follow the steps under LetsEncrypt for automating znc.pem creation
[13:09:17] <Andrio> Eh
[13:09:38] <Andrio> You could assign those files to a group that gives ZNC access.
[13:10:02] <Andrio> Or just copy the files into the ZNC working directory.
[13:10:59] <Nacorid> Wouldn't you have to reassign group access after an update anyway?
[13:11:23] <sorta4> oh nice it worked!
[13:13:24] <sorta4> let me get this straight, i need to point weechat to sattopadhyay.me:port or sattopadhyay.me/port ?
[13:14:19] <bookworm> Nacorid: no. At least not if you have a good CA renewer. Certbot honors user/group during a cert update iirc
[13:15:02] <mgedmin> oh, does it?  I always used a certbot hook to cp and chown the cert after a renewal
[13:16:30] <mgedmin> (besides all the privkeys/certs created by certbot live inside a directory accesible only by root)

[16:05:25] <sorta> how would i change the existing list of autojoin channels in znc? i couldnt find any option in the webadmin , please tell me where it is, if it is there and i have missed
[16:19:41] <style> sorta... u should go to Edit Network
[16:20:00] <style> go to https://url:port/mods/global/webadmin/edituser
[16:20:07] <style> Your Settings
[16:20:21] <style> under Your Settings u have the network(s) added to ur acc
[16:20:29] <style> and then edit the network u want
[16:20:32] <style> and u have the channels there
[16:21:24] <style> but u can part a channel from the irc client and the znc will remember that u removed it
[16:21:32] <style> and will not join it back when u reconnect
[16:22:21] <style> like... if i part now #znc, close the irc client (mirc in my case) and I open it again and reconnect to my znc account... will not be in #znc until I rejoin it myself
[16:25:40] <sorta> it seems like the channels i join are auto added
[16:25:47] <sorta> yeah this is alright too

[16:41:18] <Khaytsus> Yes, if you don't want znc to stay in a channel, part it.
[17:05:48] <aog> how do you delete a channel present on `listchans` ?

[18:24:39] <peetee> > By default, your buffers aren't even stored on disk. That depends more on your RAM.
[18:24:39] <peetee> Why? Convos does, thelounge does 
[18:24:40] <aog> Khaytsus so there's no way to remove it?
[18:26:24] <knolle> it lists the channels you're in... if you don't want a channel to be on there, don't be in it
[18:27:01] <aog> I am not in it
[18:27:02] <aog> and it's stil listing
[18:27:14] <Khaytsus> Part it.
[18:27:44] <knolle> did you use detach?
[18:28:52] <aog> yes, detach still didn't work
[18:29:06] <aog> part worked!
[18:29:06] <aog> thanks Khaytsus 
[18:29:09] <knolle> detach isn't supposed to work
