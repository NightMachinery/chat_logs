[00:21:54] <murthy> Who am I to deny, She was so good at being in trouble, so bad at being in love. Now that you're gone it's been a long, lonely time, It's a long, sad, lonely time...
[00:44:25] <Panther> Statistically, it takes 4.017 months for a meme to be funny before it loses value.
[00:44:41] <murthy> Panther: hi
[00:50:53] <SummerSkies> hey murthy
[00:52:51] <Panther> Hiya murthy :)
[00:53:21] <murthy> SummerSkies: hi
[00:53:29] <SummerSkies> how is it going
[00:53:40] <murthy> SummerSkies: I am good ty. How are you?
[00:53:43] <SummerSkies> morlog: are you gonna insult everyone in the channel and call it a shithole and then return under an hour later?
[00:53:52] <SummerSkies> strange behavior indeed, make decisions that you're confident in 
[00:54:17] <SummerSkies> murthy: not bad, 3 days out from having stopped smoking weed, just ignoring the tendencies

[01:04:45] <murthy> SummerSkies: wb
[01:05:37] <murthy> I am not sure if morlog is threatening or crying in his tent
[01:05:52] <murthy> threatening because he says he as a battle axe
[01:05:54] <SummerSkies> I know what he's doing; going about his sadness the wrong way.
[01:06:12] <SummerSkies> if you're not on here to seek help from a friend there's no reason to spill overly dramatic misery into IRC channels
[01:06:14] <murthy> SummerSkies: oh ya thats well known
[01:06:26] <murthy> I am the number one victim of him
[01:06:33] <SummerSkies> to be honest I'm kind of a hypocrite with that though
[01:06:59] <SummerSkies> but most of the time when I snap at someone or take them by strangle hold in what started as a friendly conversation, it's because i didn't realize the state i was in and once i do i try and log off as soon as possible
[01:07:04] <SummerSkies> this isn't a support group 
[01:07:14] <SummerSkies> I'd be happy to talk to his ass if he didn't act like a douchebag

[01:07:54] <murthy> ya
[01:07:57] <SummerSkies> here everybody, this is track 6 from my newest album, good vibes to recover with.
[01:08:18] <murthy> ok now that he is gone, lets talk behind his back, talk very bad about him
[01:08:27] <murthy> lets gossip
[01:08:33] <SummerSkies> I'm done
[01:08:38] <SummerSkies> i said what i feel alreayd 
[01:08:42] <murthy> first I will tell what happened
[01:08:56] <murthy> I will tell why that dude is upset
[01:10:21] <murthy> The house where he is staying in a tent in the backyard(rented) got burned by fire accident from electric
[01:10:48] <murthy> but when the fire marshal investigated, they found that the fire was not started by electricity
[01:11:45] <murthy> It was found that dude was the reason, dude was farting gas a lot and so the fire marshal sealed his hole and put a fire hazard sign on it
[01:11:56] <piercedwater> LOL
[01:12:14] <murthy> so now that dude is not able to fart gas, dude is exploding here
[01:13:52] <murthy> so in case he is says its burying here and I am hot, don't go near him, its not the fscking weather, he means literally
[01:13:58] <murthy> burning

[21:15:00] <LibertyDillo>  <nativetexan> i have mine set to google but i'm thinking about duck << startpage.com is good as they also don't track you.  I use startpage most of the time but use google when I'm looking for something really obscure or technical in nature
[21:15:26] <nativetexan> ok thanks LibertyDillo
[21:15:45] <nativetexan> i haven't heard of startpage
[21:16:39] <Panther> Google definitely doesn't work as well anymore, but it still gives more results.
[21:17:10] <Panther> It tries to 'understand' what you are searching for instead of just searching for what you tell it, and it usually fucks it all up.
[21:17:18] <nativetexan> lol
[21:18:47] <Panther> It has always been a little biased, cuz for one thing you can pay to have ADs put at the top.
[21:20:05] <LibertyDillo> startpage returns results starting with promotions, but they clearly label them as ads
[21:20:29] <Panther> It was nice back when things just worked without everyone constantly trying to take advantage of everyone else. It is a losing proposition for them to keep changing their algorithm to make sure that no one can continuously take advantage of it and exploit it.
[21:20:38] <LibertyDillo> I assume that's how they make their money, since they're not selling your data like google
[21:20:57] <nativetexan> yeah
[21:21:09] <Panther> What I am saying is, it would be nice to have a search engine that just searched. :)
[21:21:34] <LibertyDillo> everything's 'monetized' these days, Panther :/

[21:22:02] <Panther> That is because the economic system is over 500 years old, and is broken beyond repair for our modern society.
[21:22:22] <LibertyDillo> With what would you replace it?
[21:22:31] <Panther> A new one :)
[21:22:45] <LibertyDillo> Can you be a bit more specific?
[21:22:53] <Panther> I am about to start a show, so I can't get more specific right now.
[21:23:19] <Panther> However, it has to do with valuation. There is a massive discrepency in how things are valued.
[21:23:24] <nativetexan> just static right now Panther, the automation isn't playing anything
[21:23:55] <Panther> I am not gonna mess with it until after.
[21:24:06] <Panther> See if you can hear something.. I'll play.
[21:24:13] <nativetexan> aight
[21:24:41] <nativetexan> yes
[21:24:43] <Panther> Should be now.

[21:25:11] <nativetexan> and now it's off

[21:34:58] <Inline> hello nativetexan 
[21:35:00] <Inline> how are you ?
[21:35:09] <nativetexan> good thanks, yourself?
[21:38:26] * Panther passes a bong of Summit gamma laced with pure d-8 oil.
[21:38:57] <nativetexan> does this help boost your good mood?
[21:39:00] <nativetexan> hehe
[21:39:07] * nativetexan takes a hit and passes to the left
[21:39:33] <Panther> Sho 'nuff do dat.
[21:40:29] <Panther> The Summit is all CBD, so the d-8 adds a little touch, but it's not as powerful as d-9 like in the forbidden fruit, etc...
[21:42:13] <Panther> Still, since the Summit is natural it comes with some nice terpenes 0.55% and a little CBG, too.
[21:42:42] <Panther> Lots of the CBD 'flower' is sprayed with the chemicals.. these aren't.
[21:45:09] <Panther> I made a whole fresh bong a few days ago with a fresh packet of activated charcoal.
[21:45:16] *** Joins: cantelope (~cantelope@173-27-116-255.client.mchsi.com)
[21:45:31] <nativetexan> why activated charcoal?
[21:46:02] <Panther> It cleans out the water, and it also adsorbs particulates and other non-water soluble things.
[21:46:57] <nativetexan> so...what difference would clean water make? 
[21:47:01] <Panther> The terpenes, cannabanoids, etc.. are not really affected by it much.
[21:47:09] <Panther> Better filtration
[21:47:14] <nativetexan> ok
[21:47:36] <Panther> Healthier smoke to inhale... fewer irritating particles, carcinogens, etc...
[21:47:50] <nativetexan> healthier smoke, i see
[21:49:48] <Panther> It's arguable how much, but it is still better.. this is the charcoal they use to filter fish tanks so the fish don't die from an accumulation of crap in the water.
[21:50:35] <Panther> You have to rince it well first, cuz it's covered with coal dust.
[21:50:40] <Panther> rinse, too.
[21:51:34] <nativetexan> i've never had pet fish
[21:52:02] <Panther> I did, and there were also some at school we had to care for.
[21:52:16] <nativetexan> one of the guys does though, i feed them when i take of his dogs
[21:52:30] <Panther> Nice :)
[21:53:46] <Panther> One of my friends had a huge saltwater aquarium.... that's like 2 orders of magnitude more complex.
[21:54:06] <Panther> You have to constantly measure and adjust the water, and have sump pumps, etc...
