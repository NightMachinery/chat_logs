[14:48:23] <testuser[m]> cant invite anyone
[14:48:54] <AryaBackup[m]> i will but that will allow people to easily invite bots to the group

[15:56:19] <AryaBackup[m]> no matrix
[15:56:29] <AryaBackup[m]> he wanted a default setting to be changed
[15:56:31] <AryaBackup[m]> did it
[18:41:56] <NeoVoid[m]> why you migrated back?
[18:48:53] <NeoVoid[m]> hello. how do you install libxft-bgra in debian based distros?
[18:49:09] <pystardust> Wassup guys
[18:49:46] <NeoVoid[m]> pystardust: hello learning some redhat stuff
[18:50:23] <pystardust> ohh, hows it? compared to deb/arch
[18:51:51] <NeoVoid[m]> arch rules no matter what.
[18:52:13] <pystardust> AryaBackup[m]: hows ur neovim experience going?
[18:52:20] <NeoVoid[m]> compared to debian its kinda similar as in stability.
[18:52:31] <NeoVoid[m]> if we are talking about rocky linux btw
[18:52:49] <pystardust> NeoVoid[m]: tru, but if we live in a place with limited internet, I doubt if arch is good
[18:52:55] <NeoVoid[m]> but in package management i just learn dnf taking over yum
[18:53:37] <pystardust> i feel debian is the best. arch is good for tinkerers and ppl who want latest edge, but if i had a serious job and couldn't missout on anything. I would go for debian
[18:54:16] <NeoVoid[m]> pystardust: hmm may be. I know some bulky images for centos comes with alot of preinstalled packages ready to be installed ofline with installed
[18:54:17] <NeoVoid[m]> s/installed/installer/
[18:55:04] <NeoVoid[m]> pystardust: i feel like stuck in stable releases.
[18:55:23] <NeoVoid[m]> and its package manager also doesnt look neat
[18:55:42] <pystardust> but the software is good na. I don't see much point with latest software unless I wanna do ricing and stuff.
[18:56:16] <pystardust> package manager is good for debian, it's more easier to use compared to pacman for a complete beginner
[18:58:28] <NeoVoid[m]> right apt install is better than pacman -S
[18:58:58] <NeoVoid[m]> i loved synaptic package manager and missed it in arch
[18:59:14] <NeoVoid[m]> it was great old times
[18:59:38] <pystardust> true, the start days of using linux with ubuntu
[19:03:09] <AryaBackup[m]> <pystardust> "Arya (Migrated back to matrix...." <- rocky 
[19:03:26] <AryaBackup[m]> got a basic lua config after referring to a lot of guides
[19:03:34] <AryaBackup[m]> not as easy as emacs to get a basic lua config
[19:03:35] <AryaBackup[m]> imo
[19:03:47] <AryaBackup[m]> vimscript is abundant
[19:05:08] <AryaBackup[m]> any starter lua configs you recommend?
[19:05:18] <AryaBackup[m]> for emacs i started with daviwil's config
[19:05:32] <AryaBackup[m]> and uncledave dont forget him
[19:05:39] <AryaBackup[m]> they were both very well documented
[19:07:38] <NeoVoid[m]> gosh there are so much quality folks at linux community but so isolated and distributed in different part of internet its impossible to list all of them in one centralized list
[19:08:46] <AryaBackup[m]> got tmux setup tho
[19:08:56] <AryaBackup[m]> now need to find out how to implement it in my twm workflow
[19:12:49] <NeoVoid[m]> "he is talking to himself"
[19:12:50] <NeoVoid[m]> "let him be"
[19:12:50] <NeoVoid[m]> ðŸ™ƒ
[19:17:38] <pystardust> AryaBackup[m]: maybe try normal vimrc, with just some binds. If ur comfy with that then go into lua configuration
[19:18:08] <pystardust> all plugins can be installed perfectly with init.vim
[19:18:53] <pystardust> AryaBackup[m]: once tmux is there, ur wm gets kinda useless. I usually have only 2 windows in 2 tabs, one terminal with tmux and another browser
[19:21:30] <AryaBackup[m]> damn rudra uses arch btw now
[19:29:31] <pystardust> arch is being hyped too much don't u think?
[19:34:03] <AryaBackup[m]> no 
[19:34:06] <AryaBackup[m]> it always was
[19:34:13] <AryaBackup[m]> you should hyp cool distros
[19:34:16] <AryaBackup[m]> like bedrock
[19:34:18] <AryaBackup[m]> instead of arch
[19:34:23] <AryaBackup[m]> arch is like ubuntu imo
[19:34:25] <AryaBackup[m]> rocksolid
[19:34:29] <AryaBackup[m]> you never need to think about it
[19:45:04] <smud[m]1> <AryaBackup[m]> "any starter lua configs you..." <- tpope's sensible defaults?
[19:45:09] <smud[m]1> Oh wait you meant lua
[19:45:12] <AryaBackup[m]> what 
[19:45:39] <smud[m]1> Were you looking for sensible vim config to start off with?
[19:45:49] <AryaBackup[m]> neovim
[19:45:52] <AryaBackup[m]> lua
[19:45:57] <AryaBackup[m]> not default vim
[19:45:57] <smud[m]1> Same thing
[19:46:05] <AryaBackup[m]> smud[m]1: yes
[19:46:28] <smud[m]1> The thing about nvim lua is that you'll have to use vimscript even inside lua
[19:47:38] <smud[m]1> ```lua
[19:47:47] <AryaBackup[m]> what
[19:48:44] <smud[m]1> Even if you have a full lua config, it will still be using a lot of vim.api.* to run vimscript statements
[19:50:19] <smud[m]1> Like setting up highlights for example, there's no native lua api for that. You'll have to call vimscript from lua, using vim.api.nvim_exec
