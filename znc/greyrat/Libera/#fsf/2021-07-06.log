[14:20:32] <Veaugnu> Hello everybody. I'm looking for a way to getting started to learn Free/Libre Software programing or development, to understand the source code as a simple end-user. Have you any clues for this ?

[14:30:08] <damo22> using apt
[14:32:07] <damo22> then you can read it!
[14:36:33] <dragestil> Veaugnu: you can also try emacs if you haven't. it is an editor that invites you to tinker with the code

[22:01:11] <bugweiser> i'm here yrk
[22:01:36] <yrk> bugweiser: have you already written in to licensing@fsf.org, do you have a ticket going there with your questions?
[22:02:27] <bugweiser> no, I haven't written to licensing@fsf.org, predominantly as it appears I have so simple basic questions.
[22:02:49] <yrk> bugweiser: ok, so what was the question?
[22:04:33] <bugweiser> basically, i'm told that a licence text is copyrighted and that changing *anything* below the copyright notice *including* changing the 'copyright holder field' (so to say) (in for example the warranty disclaimer) constitutes as a derivative work.
[22:05:34] <bugweiser> that sounds strange, as, using for example ISC or MIT or 0BSD (etc. ) would kinda require me to change the text of for example the warranty disclaimer.
[22:06:09] <yrk> bugweiser: we'll need to separate the different issues here, because you are mixing two very different things
[22:06:23] *** Quits: Megver83 (~Icedove@pc-88-170-100-190.cm.vtr.net) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[22:06:34] * bugweiser pays close attention and thanks yrk in advance
[22:06:53] <yrk> bugweiser: to start, are you talking about the copyright notice of the license, or the copyright notice in the code the license applies to
[22:07:48] <bugweiser> the entire licence text as commonly 'given': that is copyright notice, carving-up-rights, legal-scaffolding (warranty disclaimer).
[22:07:59] <seabass> Whether a change constitutes a derivative work is more to do with how extensive the change is, rather than which part of the document it applies to :) 
[22:08:15] <yrk> bugweiser: ok, so we are talking about just a copyright license, and not the code it applies to
[22:08:22] <yrk> bugweiser: good, that is a solid clarification
[22:08:40] <yrk> bugweiser: you are right that those are texts that typically should not be changed
[22:08:52] <bugweiser> yes, only and purely about the public licence text to be added into the source-code (at the top)
[22:08:59] <yrk> bugweiser: for instance, the GPL's license states that changing it is not allowed
[22:09:33] <seabass> changing the 'copyright holder' field wouldn't be a derivative work as the change wouldn't be considered 'creative' - which is usually the criteria for eligiblity for copyright protection
[22:09:37] <bugweiser> yes, and the gnu website then contradicts that (and as side question, would that website then constitute as some ammendment to the licence text ?)
[22:09:48] <yrk> bugweiser: the fsf is lenient about it (as explained in their FAQ on the subject)
[22:10:17] <bugweiser> https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#ModifyGPL
[22:10:25] <yrk> bugweiser: that isn't a contradiction, but an explanation that if you do insist of changing the GPL, the fsf probably not going to come after you to sue you, but try to discuss why you want to do it
[22:10:59] <yrk> bugweiser: the FSF are not _required_ to prevent you from the changing the GPL, but they ask that you do not, and state that much in the license of the GPL (which is verbatim-only)
[22:11:00] <bugweiser> so we didn't really get a license either (as the licence text itself reserves the right to modification)
[22:11:15] <yrk> bugweiser: I don't understand that last statement
[22:12:12] <bugweiser> the gpl license text includes a public license statement about the license text (reserving the right to modification).
[22:12:38] <yrk> bugweiser: still don't understand. can you please quote the part of the gpl that you think says that?
[22:13:06] <yrk> bugweiser: I feel like we may be working around a language barrier, which doesn't make things easier (English is not my first language either)
[22:13:30] <yrk> bugweiser: so let's quote from the text so that we are not at cross purposes
[22:15:17] <seabass> if I can jump in to answer what I think bugweiser is asking: no, the GPL itself is not licensed under the GPL. However, the license that the GPL is under (use and copy but not modify) is defined inside the GPL itself.
[22:15:53] <panosalevro> kind of like CC-BY-ND :P
[22:15:58] <seabass> which would mean, essentially, that there's a mini license inside the GPL. that seems rather cute! :)
[22:16:22] <bugweiser> sorry it's taking me so long
[22:16:31] <seabass> pandakekok9, yeah, pretty much :) That said the CC-BY-ND is well-written for generic use by other projects
[22:16:42] <yrk> seabass: yes, since by default you are not allowed to further distribute a work for which you are not the copyright holder, without that license you would not be allowed to distribute a copy of the GPL!
[22:16:52] <seabass> I can't think that extracting single paragraphs from the GPL for reuse is going to go well pandakekok9 :D

[22:17:01] <bugweiser> seabass, I know I read that (even in stackoverflow questions, but fail to quote that at the moment)
[22:17:05] <seabass> yrk, yup, exactly
[22:17:37] <seabass> bugweiser, I'm intruiged as to whether the reason for asking here is the same as you asked in #osi a few days ago?
[22:17:47] <yrk> stackoverflow is terrible for many reasons, and for legal questions it is worse then terrible
[22:18:40] <seabass> this is an interesting discussion of course, but if I recall your earlier question correctly you were wanting to change the disclaimer to be more explicit?
[22:19:03] <yrk> ah, I think I remember something like that
[22:19:23] <bugweiser> seabass, yeah that's core reason why I'm trying to understand these things better.
[22:19:58] <bugweiser> lol, I missed it couse it's right at the top (and I looked at the bottom): 
[22:19:59] <bugweiser> https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html
[22:20:10] <seabass> bugweiser: ah, right :) I might add though that I personally don't think that adding a more explicit disclaimer is needed - Apache-2.0 is a great license if you need something like MIT but more explicit though.
[22:20:22] <bugweiser> Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
[22:20:22] <bugweiser> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
[22:20:57] <yrk> bugweiser: excellent. yes. that allows you to further distribute the license verbatim. without that, you would not be allowed to
[22:21:43] <bugweiser> seabass, the team wants a fixed 0bsd (which in turn is derived from ISC (or Mit according to fedora))
[22:21:51] <seabass> yrk, sorry to muddy the waters :D I've heard that some lawyers believe that contracts and licenses are inherently not eligible for copyright.
[22:22:11] <seabass> (not that it is a bad thing that the GPL contains that explicit notice)
[22:22:17] <yrk> seabass: I've heard lawyers believe lots of things; that's ok
[22:22:30] <bugweiser> :)
[22:22:44] <yrk> bugweiser: so why are we discussing the license of the GPL if you want to modify a bsd-style license?
[22:22:57] <bugweiser> anywho, before we get side tracked, the gpl text states you can't modify, the gnu website says you can :)
[22:23:08] <bugweiser> indeed
[22:23:15] <yrk> bugweiser: that's OK, both are written by the same people.
[22:23:32] <seabass> bugweiser, ah, right - maybe you could use a license like Apache and then add a special additional permission
[22:24:00] <panosalevro> ^ i think thats the only correct way to do it
[22:24:03] <bugweiser> Ok, so, what is the licence to the Apache licence text (as again we'd be creating a derivative work)
[22:24:33] <yrk> bugweiser: to be clear, the license notice at the top of the GPL makes it clear that you can indeed distribute verbatim copies. since it is only the FSF that can enforce the terms of the license, if they write exceptions of clarifications to that text in their FAQ, then that's their right
[22:25:09] <panosalevro> i dont think thats a derivative work. you use a license text verbatim, then you add your own term. as long as you specify that the term you added is not part of the original license, i think you're okay
[22:25:11] <seabass> bugweiser: I belive that adding an additional permission to Apache-2.0 wouldn't create a derivative work
[22:25:20] <seabass> haha snap, panosalevro :)
[22:25:24] <panosalevro> :)
[22:26:08] <panosalevro> this is why i believe the original question is a matter of legal technicalities and not something we can answer with pure certainty
[22:26:50] <yrk> panosalevro: I still don't understand what the original question is
[22:27:09] <panosalevro> the original question is about the copyright of the license text itself
[22:27:32] <seabass> yrk: looking more closely at my countries legislation, it seems as if contracts would come under literary work copyright
[22:27:34] <bugweiser> the original question initially was about copying someone else's warranty discalimer text (from their licence text, to ours).
[22:27:40] *** Joins: zleap (~zleap@user/zleap)
[22:28:02] <bugweiser> but then it was sayd that the warranty disclaimer text was part of a copyrighted document, ie the licence text where you copied it form.
[22:28:04] <yrk> bugweiser: ah; that's rather straighforward to answer
[22:28:07] <yrk> bugweiser: don't do that
[22:28:42] <yrk> bugweiser: pay a copyright lawyer who works in the relevant jurisdiction to pen the right license and the right warranty
[22:29:00] <yrk> bugweiser: you were right, it is a straighforward question
[22:29:14] <bugweiser> from there on it was said that EVEN changing someting that common sense might consider to be a 'field' to be filled out (corp/author name in warranty disclaimer text) was sufficient to create a NEW licence (being a derivative work). That's where my brain went 'poof'
[22:29:52] <panosalevro> in my opinion, that should not be considered a derivative work
[22:29:53] <seabass> bugweiser: nope, I'm pretty sure that would not be sufficient to be a derivitive work :)
[22:30:01] <panosalevro> we did it again seabass 
[22:30:13] <yrk> bugweiser: ideally, don't write a new license at all. license proliferation is bad for everyone. but if you absolutely have to, then the only way to do it correctly is with legal help
[22:30:15] <seabass> lol are our brains connected? :D 
[22:30:27] <seabass> M-x telepathy-mode RET panosalevro RET :D
[22:30:29] <yrk> bugweiser: don't ask a lawyer to code for you, and don't ask a coder to write a legal text
[22:30:47] <yrk> bugweiser: don't ask a surgeon to work on your car either...
[22:31:09] <seabass> yrk: you never know what hobbies surgeons might have :) Tinkering with cars is a hobby for some
[22:31:32] <seabass> much harder to do now that cars have ECUs in them... 
[22:31:39] <yrk> seabass: sure, and if you want a "hobby" job done on the car you drive your family in...
[22:32:01] <seabass> yrk: I have a funny story about that which I can tell you if you like :)
[22:32:02] <bugweiser> lol, then 0BSD?  Someone (well, at least 2 persons) take the ISC licence, remove exactly ONE part of a line, and call it 0BSD or Free software licence 1.0.0
[22:32:21] <bugweiser> Both are approved licences by the way.
[22:32:31] <seabass> bugweiser: the person who created the license never called it the Free Software License 1.0.0, IIRC
[22:32:51] <seabass> a different person who submitted it to the OSI called it that
[22:32:51] <yrk> bugweiser: note that the license approval process often includes consulting with _lawyers_

[22:39:34] <yrk> bugweiser: wait, how do you know that the specific warranty disclaimer is the right one if you don't have a lawyer telling you?

[22:40:39] <bugweiser> no, but all permutations i've seen of MIT (a LOT) and ISC and BSD neglect to include a phrase which makes you a criminal in this continent called australia.
[22:41:17] <bugweiser> there should be simply a updated family of those. 
[22:41:19] <yrk> bugweiser: you are contradicting yourself: if you knew enough to make a legal determination like that then you would know the answer to your own question
[22:42:05] <bugweiser> I only know this thing is real, and that all 'proper' licences have this hole plugged, in an identical fashion.
[22:42:33] <bugweiser> (and often add extra clarifications for australia and germany etc.)
[22:42:38] <bugweiser> just to be sure
[22:42:43] <yrk> bugweiser: I'm sorry, and please don't take this personally, but I don't believe you are basing your claims about the suitability of the warranty disclaimer on reality, but on your layman's perception of reality. unfortunately, if someone sues you then saying "but we really did our best and asked people on irc" won't work

[22:47:31] <yrk> bugweiser: the main issue at hand is that we all have to just take your word for it that you have an in-depth legal understanding of warranties in australia, and yet don't understand how derivatives work in copyright. that doesn't exactly add up.
[22:48:12] <yrk> I know that we are all hackers here, and we love to hack, and we hate to be told not to hack something. but a smart hacker knows what they don't know
[22:50:17] <bugweiser> a public licence generally isn't just tied to my juristiction, right? It's a legal contract which we offer world wide to utter strangers, right?
[22:50:55] <yrk> bugweiser: not really. one of the biggest changes between gplv2 and gplv3 is that they made it more international-friendly
[22:51:14] <yrk> bugweiser: many licenses have built-in assumptions about the local jurisdictions
[22:51:33] <yrk> bugweiser: writing a so-called "world-wide" license is actually really hard
[22:51:49] <bugweiser> do you mean setting governing law and jurisdiction?
[22:52:41] <yrk> bugweiser: a license with a "choice of jurisdiction" clause is typically considered non-free, but that is one way people get around the issue of differing jurisdictions
[22:52:43] <bugweiser> but, isn't for example MIT or ISC offered worldwide? You code something, modify that text, paste it on top of the code, post it on github. Seems standard practice..
[22:52:57] <bugweiser> that text = that license text
[22:53:14] <yrk> bugweiser: standard practice on github is absolutely terrible from a licensing perspective
[22:53:57] <yrk> ...so is just using github, but that's a different issue

[23:01:43] <bugweiser> I was under the impression that 'public license' is the proper name, as it is not a custom license brokered between 2 parties.
[23:02:07] <bugweiser> it's a license for everyone to take, without contacting the copyright holders and broker a custom license.
[23:02:47] <yrk> bugweiser: the gpl _is_ a custom license, and can also be only between 2 parties
[23:02:57] <bugweiser> and in turn the word 'license' encompasses also that it is a legally binding contract.
