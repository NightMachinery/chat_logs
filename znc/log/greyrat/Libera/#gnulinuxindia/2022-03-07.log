[06:34:35] <gtlsgamr> I have tried it but only ever got disappointed
[06:36:34] <Klisper[m]> gtlsgamr why did u get married
[06:36:37] *** Klisper[m] is now known as ElJohnSepiol[m]
[06:36:39] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> why live sad life
[06:36:49] <gtlsgamr> It was the next logical step.
[06:37:02] <gtlsgamr> I had finished my studies, got a job, got promoted.. earning good. 
[06:37:04] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> isnt it sad
[06:37:11] <gtlsgamr> Why would it be sad?
[06:39:06] <Abhi[m]> Not all married people sad
[06:39:12] <Abhi[m]> Many happy
[06:39:21] <gtlsgamr> exactly.
[06:39:48] <gtlsgamr> I don't know where ElJohnSepiol[m] gets this thing that marriage is a sad affair
[06:39:53] <Abhi[m]> > <Abhi> I will marry,if we both improves various aspects of our life, we like being with togather generally and well want to spend life together and want to make it official to get various benifits like tax benefits.. 
[06:39:53] <Abhi[m]> > 
[06:39:53] <Abhi[m]> > FYI - This is vague and didn‚Äôt put that much thought in this .
[06:39:53] <Abhi[m]> @ElJohnSepi0l my thoughts
[06:40:02] <Abhi[m]> gtlsgamr: Boomer jokes
[06:40:16] <gtlsgamr> True. Boomer jokes have made it worse.
[06:40:32] <Abhi[m]> gtlsgamr: How‚Äôs your wife doing ?
[06:40:40] <Abhi[m]> That sounds weird
[06:40:41] <Abhi[m]> lol
[06:40:57] <Abhi[m]> Let me rephrase hope you both happy

[09:22:21] <iamak[m]> <gtlsgamr> "‡§è‡§ï‡•á: My suggestion... don't..." <- Yeah which is why I was looking for other fs
[09:22:38] <iamak[m]> I will try exfat today
[09:29:33] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> is openbsd audio better than linux?
[09:53:07] <gtlsgamr> 11:22    iamak[m] ‚îÇ  I will try exfat today ))<-- I have been using ext4 with no issues since the past 1 year
[09:53:21] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i kinda hav doubt about ip addresses is the max number in ipv4 255 like can one number go above 255?
[09:54:24] <gtlsgamr> An IPv4 address is made up of four octets -- an octet being an eight-bit value.
[09:54:27] <gtlsgamr> When you have eight bits, the number of possible combinations is 28 which is 256. The numbering starts at zero, so the range for each octet (which we represent separated by dots) is 0 to 255.
[09:54:44] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> ok so
[09:54:57] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> 212.258.108.240
[09:55:02] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> would not be a valid ip?
[09:55:25] <gtlsgamr> no.. since 258.
[09:55:36] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> ok i got it thanks
[09:55:47] <gtlsgamr> 258 decimal to binary is 100000010
[09:55:49] <gtlsgamr> 9 bits.
[09:55:58] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> and 8 bits are the limit
[09:56:00] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> in ipv4
[09:57:17] <gtlsgamr> 4 octets
[09:57:17] <gtlsgamr> yes
[09:59:04] <iamak[m]> <gtlsgamr> "11:22    ‡§è‡§ï‡•á ‚îÇ  I will try exfat..." <- I want it to be readable by windows as well
[09:59:14] <iamak[m]> I only have 500GB HDD
[10:08:52] <gtlsgamr> but why keep windows?
[10:08:55] <gtlsgamr> it blows ::::(

[10:42:34] <gtlsgamr> what do you guys use for autocompletion in nvim>?
[10:43:11] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> wait the real question is
[10:43:14] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> why are you using nvim
[10:44:44] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp
[10:44:48] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> these seems ok
[10:50:23] <gtlsgamr> I use it for text editing, coding.
[10:53:08] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> vim does the same thing...
[10:54:02] <gtlsgamr> vim/nvim
[10:54:10] <gtlsgamr> what do i do to get autocompletion?
[10:54:25] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> <ElJohnSepiol[m]> "https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim..." <- .
[10:54:29] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> nvim-cmp

[11:02:12] <usrbinenvchad[m]> <ElJohnSepiol[m]> "https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim..." <- this is just the completion engine. it uses plugins like cmp-buf cmp-lsp to provide completion
[11:02:21] <usrbinenvchad[m]> <gtlsgamr> "what do i do to get autocompleti..." <- check out my nvim config.
[11:04:20] <usrbinenvchad[m]> <gtlsgamr> "what do i do to get autocompleti..." <- https://gitlab.com/pixeltee/nvim-init.lua

[11:09:05] <gtlsgamr> usrbinenvchad[m]: is it worth it? moving from init.vim to init.lua?

[11:42:23] <AryaK[m]> its more modern ig
[11:42:33] <AryaK[m]> plus all new features are prob gonna be on lua thing
[11:42:41] <AryaK[m]> even tho you can run lua code in init.vim
