[00:00:13] <Sensiva> Hello everyone, Does anyone know an energy monitoring solution that works on debian? Basically pulls energy readings from standard meters and log those readings in a database for processing.
[00:02:22] *** Joins: alMalsamo (~alMalsamo@gateway/tor-sasl/almalsamo)
[00:02:26] <amacater_> Sensiva: It depends :) "Standard" meters probably have non-standard proprietary protocols
[00:03:07] <Sensiva> then those are not standard
[00:03:34] <Khepra> which standard tho. there's 14 competing standards... ;)
[00:04:16] <kee> That's silly. Let's make one unifying standard instead.
[00:04:32] <Khepra> quick googling there are SNMP based power meters, so that's one standard

[00:08:19] <Khepra> I am assuming it's the dev package you want, as OpenAL is basically libs you need to use in your program

[01:31:07] <wez> crosspost? Does Debian have more than one channel here?
[01:31:46] <sney> they asked the same question simultaneously in #debian here and on OFTC

[01:32:24] <wez> Ah, I never knew about that server
[01:32:50] <wez> Does Freenode still exist?

[01:33:53] <sney> there are irc servers listening at freenode addresses, but the vast majority of communities left, and the new management also tried to push everyone to their own proprietary client
[01:34:16] <wez> lol
[01:34:21] <dvs> oh, I didn't know about the new client part
[01:34:26] <sney> OFTC was created during a much different freenode meltdown that happened in 2006
[01:34:46] <sney> so debian was only sort-of affected by this one
[01:34:51] <wez> so I can't use Debian's irssi package to connect to it?
[01:35:08] <Khepra> lolwut proprietary client?
[01:35:19] <sney> to current freenode? I believe you could, but you would have to log in with their thing first and set up an account
[01:36:04] <sney> there's not really a reason to go there anymore though so *shrug*
[01:36:17] <amacater_> Current freenode has almost no users at all - at one point there was a counter marking how many servers they had active compared to say Libera.chat
[01:37:06] <wez> heh
[01:37:27] <cheapie> There are bots relaying a few of the larger channels on current-freenode over to another network so we can watch - their biggest channel has like maybe one actual conversation a day.

[01:38:07] <amacater_> Ten thousand users max - fourteen thousand channels ... and they carried forward no content from the old servers

[01:45:16] <amacater_> Possibly take your mouse to the top corner of the screen?
[01:45:29] <badsektor> that menu doesnt have a login/logout option i am afraid, just options settings change background

[01:56:51] <sney> since the window manager crash (which is what this sounds like) happened after exiting a game, I'm guessing it was some weirdness with the video driver, maybe having to do with wayland as well

[13:46:37] <Khepra> you got that the other way around. "thank you #debian for providing me with free, unpaid advice, experience and help."
[13:46:41] <Khepra> you're welcome :)
[13:46:58] <xmb> i have a different question tho, .. it applies not just to my system but especially all and default debian and ubuntus
[13:47:12] <xmb> cool mate kheora i see it so also
[13:47:34] <xmb> but also back for reporting, .. all oss stuff
[13:47:49] <xmb> so my question is about the resource limit of 30 or 33 % found in default
[13:48:00] <Khepra> there is no such default
[13:48:27] <xmb> i let user fork bomb me, one bash started, nothing more, it made new processes fail but old ones stayed np'ly: just like my 96core 100g ram server project, where this limit was enforced more obviously, and made new stuff segfault even old
[13:48:46] <xmb> it went out of resources, hit, this is the limit
[13:48:59] <xmb> i set oom kill allocating task i dont think it ever ran
[13:49:03] <xmb> cause the 33% limit was hit
[13:49:19] <Khepra> please show the "33% limit" in a pastebin
[13:49:38] <xmb> i cant find it i searched for it, maybe its gone in newer releases, it was commented in a systemd like config file related to cgroups
[13:49:45] <xmb> but lemme search again
[13:51:26] <xmb> it may be cause i ditched and --purge'ed systemd* excepts udevd
[13:51:29] <Khepra> xmb: no such limit exists in debian by default. if you see any, again, please pastebin what you see. show the cgroup objects from sys and the configuration setting so.
[13:51:49] <xmb> this is real life experience mate, it happened on default ubuntu ( their stuff ) then on debian it was the same ( my variant )
[13:51:55] <xmb> i couldnt test disabled cgroups back then
[13:51:59] <xmb> ill let u know when i find the config file

[13:54:01] <xmb> dude i couldnt change it anyway, i did enter 100 comment delete nothing worked
[13:54:18] <Khepra> xmb: again, until you can literally show the limit from the cgroup sys objects, this is all meaningless.
[13:54:21] <xmb> k
[13:54:28] <xmb> can u gimme cgroups list command
[13:54:47] <Khepra> I saw aliens once too. but until I can prove it, it's meaningless trying to convince anyone.

[13:55:58] <xmb> i wished just to report my stuff, as i did see it ill be on the topic again
[13:56:02] <xmb> first thing is a cgroups free kernel
[13:56:17] <xmb> i didnt come to play to test that on the servers back then
[13:56:40] <Khepra> to give you the command, you need to know which cgroup it is. for example for a process that is limited you can cat /proc/<that PID>/cgroup and then you can check assigned controllers

[13:57:23] <xmb> uh i know success, but also fail
[13:57:37] <xmb> i havent looked yet at the cgroups proc file, can be understandable by me, may be not
[13:57:44] <Khepra> you said you saw 33% limit in cgroups. show the actual cgroup controller with that limit
[13:58:08] <xmb> i did cat /proc/[0-9]*/cgroup it said 80 files or so but all empty
[13:58:21] <xmb> it was some file named 'cgroup.default' or similiar
[13:58:23] <Khepra> that's not what we're after here
[13:58:26] <xmb> from that i got it
[13:58:57] <Khepra> xmb: cool, so pastebin the cgroup info showing 33% limit
[13:59:09] <xmb> u didnt read i cant find it nowadays ?
[13:59:20] <xmb> got an old ubuntu server ? =p
[13:59:41] <xmb> i assume when cgroup files in proc are empty no cgroups are loaded
[13:59:48] <xmb> also no cgroup moutns should be.. lemme check
[14:00:01] <xmb> yea no cgroup fs
[14:00:03] <Khepra> then NEXT time you see it, come with a pastebin. until then, this is meaningless.
[14:00:07] <xmb> k
[14:00:26] <Khepra> I am sure you understand that we can't help you fix some abstract issue you can't even describe properly, let alone even begin fixing...
[14:00:28] <xmb> what is the systemd target when using 'resource limit' keyword
[14:00:36] <xmb> or [resource] \n limit = 33%
[14:00:56] <xmb> i understand well, i just dont understand how u could question instead of assume users view
[14:00:57] <Khepra> xmb: systemd.resource-control(5) manpage explains those.
[14:01:11] <xmb> ill, try to fetch it
[14:01:12] <Khepra> that syntax "resource limit = 33%" does not exist in systemd
[14:01:26] <Khepra> I don't think it exists anywhere because...... what "resource" lol? memory? cpu? io?
[14:01:27] <xmb> what about [resource] limit ..
[14:01:35] <xmb> it was resource litarly i swear
[14:01:44] <Khepra> don't care about you swearing. SHOW IT
[14:01:58] <Khepra> pastebin the file that has that. next time you see it.
[14:02:04] <xmb> when i come over it i will lemme man that page i dont have it i bet
[14:02:08] <xmb> i will

[14:02:10] <jelly> you can ask here if you can reproduce the issue on a Debian installation
[14:02:11] <xmb> :)
[14:02:21] <xmb> i have debian only
[14:02:34] <xmb> u can reproduce maybe naybe i try it on laptop first
[14:02:35] <jelly> I do not count your non-root mostrosity as a Debian installation
[14:02:53] <xmb> shell forkbomb, first spawn htop or top, and watch if memory usage goes much above 33%
[14:03:12] <xmb> it will quit new proceses
[14:03:18] <Khepra> xmb: even if it does, that's no proof any "cgroup" is limited to 33% of memory
[14:03:19] <xmb> with resource limit and fork waiting, for me it did
[14:03:37] <xmb> but memory wontn show 100% ( i didnt test ill just test now on laptop brb )
[14:03:37] <Khepra> because correlation != causation
[14:03:56] <xmb> its the same error and case i had with the resource limit hit when on 96c
[14:04:01] <xmb> it was memory limit hit meant
[14:04:05] <Khepra> htop is also not a reliable metric because it is blind to transient states between two refreshes which is 1 second I believe, by default
[14:04:21] <xmb> htop -d 5
[14:04:31] <xmb> ill just test now brb, screen on server stays
[14:04:42] <Khepra> -d 5 is even worse, that's blind to transients inside 5 seconds
[14:04:49] <xmb> 0.5 s
[14:04:49] <Khepra> xmb: do you know any programming languages?
[14:04:51] <jelly> forkbombs will eat kernel and cpu more than RSS, if you want to test for memory limits, allocate memory

[14:05:38] <xmb> some basic to advanced .c but not exactly
[14:05:40] <Khepra> why do I ask? becuse you can EASILY write a reproducer. write a program that mallocs() infinitely in chunks of say 1MB and SHOW where it stops at 33% of memory
[14:05:55] <xmb> it wont, i never noticed, its some mass thingy
[14:06:01] <xmb> i know i can allocate 8gb of ram
[14:06:02] <Khepra> you can write it in C, or you can write a python script that infinitely grows a dictionary or a list....
[14:06:03] <xmb> without quitting
[14:06:18] <xmb> or in bash but thats not my point
[14:06:22] <Khepra> this is a PROPER reproducer. consistent, ....reproducible.....  without that, this is all moot talk.

[14:07:18] <Khepra> note taht you can't rely on oom.  if there was a cgroup limit, then THAT process would suddenly quit with an ENOMEM
[14:07:41] <Khepra> in a cgroup-limited system, OOM would never trigger. the malloc'ing process would get back an error that it can't malloc
[14:07:54] <xmb> some limit is, just like i can code well bash

[17:20:21] <kjetilho> sounds like you need a proper power cycle.  and possibly good backups.

[17:20:23] <sussudio> are you really using IDE drives
[17:20:42] <drbeco> this server is old, yes
[17:20:48] <kjetilho> drbeco: if you are off-site, you may be able to force a reset of the kernel by echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger
[17:21:03] <drbeco> kjetilho, thanks . I'm gonna try that
[17:21:04] <Khepra> nothing steels a (wo)man at the helm of a server more than decent libata cry for help!
[17:21:17] <kjetilho> but I expect your ATA controller will want a *real* power down.
[17:21:34] <sussudio> a forever power down
[17:21:55] <drbeco> nah... it is an important asset . Maybe a new HD

[17:26:28] <Khepra> reisub ain't needed, btw, if your filesystems went belly up into the R(ead)O(nly) mode. just plug the cord, no harm done. except if the PSU is old, it might have an objection in the shape of a burst capacitor.

[20:36:15] <somiaj> yea not sure what it means by committed memory there, but looking at the graph it appears to just be the total used for various reasons including swap
[20:36:26] <somiaj> !free memeory
[20:36:34] <somiaj> !free memory
[20:36:34] <dpkg> Unlike information, your computer's memory does *not* want to be free.  Free RAM is wasted RAM!  Linux tries to use free physical memory for caching files from disk which speeds up disk access considerably.  Linux releases RAM from these caches if programs need it.  To know how much physical memory the free(1) tool says you have left for program use, it's 'available', or roughly 'free' + 'buffers' + 'cache'.  Also ask me about <swapwake>.
[20:36:46] <somiaj> my guess is it is just reporting that the memeory is being used for something, which is normal with the linux kernel
