[02:27:13] <manicennui> Might just be what they redirect to for people in Nordic countries.
[02:28:05] <manicennui> "Whole Foods has 500 stores in North America and seven in the United Kingdom as of March 4, 2019.[2][6]"

[02:42:35] <Brekkjern> buttsbot is hosted on my server which is in the UK
[03:02:32] <dimadima> i was just eyeing up some sour gummies today in the trader joe's circular
[03:04:20] <dimadima> heh riv i was wondering who wrote that paean about static vs dynamic linking
[03:05:44] <dimadima> now i know
[03:06:31] <dimadima> in some spots he's running for gov, in some spots, for senate
[03:07:05] <dimadima> this was in a sidebar on the static vs dynamic post
[03:07:07] <dimadima> "In fact, if anything on this website contradicts something that has been said, written, or otherwise spoken by the Prophet, his counselors, members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, or any other General Authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, they are right, and I am wrong. In that case, please contact me, provide a source, and I will take down the offending material and
[03:07:14] <dimadima> issue a correction."
[03:07:22] <dimadima> made me think of manicennui
[03:07:37] <dimadima> ay caramba
[03:09:54] <dimadima> not even if anything concerning religion or LDS specifically, but *anything*
[03:09:59] <dimadima> that's terrifying

[04:00:25] <dimadima> in the vaccines piece he says
[04:00:26] <dimadima> "I took an oath to the Constitution of the United States, and I will stand by that oath and the Constitution, even if it means that I face persecution or worse. No, I am not going to rise up in rebellion; I’m not that stupid."

[04:30:49] <dimadima> not sure why i said "wow"

[05:29:32] <manicennui> Specifically the first paragraph of "Authoritarian personality type".

[05:43:25] <dimadima> heh thanks manicennui that's a good find
[05:43:51] <dimadima> i like how as late as 1922: 'Fromm received his PhD in sociology from Heidelberg in 1922 with a dissertation "On Jewish Law".'
[05:43:56] <dimadima> things really changed fast over there!

[20:20:01] <manicennui> The problem isn't people like Luke Smith. He is an obvious asshole on many topics.
[20:20:06] <skyl4rk> I missed that it said "(annoying)" at the top, well that would be a given
[20:20:06] <dimadima> now i'm up to 1 linux youtube i've seen
[20:20:10] <manicennui> The problem is all of the Linux YTers who are more subtle about it.
[20:20:29] <riv> it's not?
[20:21:01] <skyl4rk> dimadima: I did not understand how/why that would be an identifiable trait significant enough to put into one of these starterpack things
[20:21:20] <manicennui> riv: You're not going to watch hours of his content without realizing he is an asshole and then you can just avoid him.
[20:21:43] <skyl4rk> but I don't really visit youtube that much, try to keep it as little as possible, so maybe I'm out of touch
[20:21:43] <dimadima> skyl4rk: i don't even know what a starterpak
[20:21:55] <manicennui> dimadima: It's basically just stereotypes about a group.

[20:22:16] <dimadima> is that a meme of sorts?
[20:22:20] <dimadima> ("starterpack")
[20:22:22] <manicennui> Sure.
[20:22:26] <dimadima> i see
[20:22:36] <dimadima> well someone who knows about the linux youtube scene needs to answer that
[20:22:48] <skyl4rk> you could go to r/starterpacks reddit if you want to know more, not that I recommend it
[20:22:48] <dimadima> chan memes are generally a non-starter for me
[20:23:07] <dimadima> i wonder why mozilla is X'd out in that image
[20:23:21] <manicennui> I wouldn't say that Luke Smith is representative. He is one of the suckless zealots who is really open about his opinions.
[20:23:26] <skyl4rk> I think it's more reddit than a chan thing but I don't care enough to research it
[20:23:42] <manicennui> But there are certainly several other YTers like him.
[20:24:01] <manicennui> dimadima: They tend to be suckless zealots too.

[21:26:45] <dimadima> strange that hasn't occured to them
[21:27:21] <gwozniak> Those sorts of things ("written in C") appeal to those who run servers, not those who use them
[21:27:25] *** Joins: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat)
[21:27:30] <ngoldbaum> this is written by the kind of person who write things in C in 2021, so rust probably isn’t appealing
[21:27:41] <gwozniak> Bitbucket may be a beast, but it does a lot of things I appreciate as part of my daily work
[21:27:44] <dimadima> (/s)
[21:28:13] <dimadima> gwozniak: what is even the server appeal of things written in C?
[21:28:28] <gwozniak> Fewer dependencies, I expect
[21:28:29] <dimadima> static binary is huge, dynamically linked binary is ... dynamically linked
[21:28:44] <dimadima> i guess i'm not a C server app person :)
[21:28:53] <gwozniak> Nor should you be
[21:29:11] <gwozniak> There are much better choices :)
[21:29:38] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: mostly, they exist
[21:30:08] <ngoldbaum> i should rephrase, writing C in 2021 makes sense if you have a legacy thing and rewriting it would be unreasonable
[21:30:17] <ngoldbaum> writing greenfield C in 2021 is insane
[21:34:05] <deadk> i can see the appeal tbh
[21:34:08] <gwozniak> Negligent, arguably
[21:35:14] <deadk> there's a bunch of things where your options are c, rust, and c++ which is either the worst or best of both worlds depending on your point of view
[21:35:27] <deadk> and while i would pick rust for most things, it's kinda trash
[21:36:40] <gwozniak> I have found myself writing a program that communicates via a unix socket in zsh.  I see no reason to change direction at this point.  I guess I'll see how it goes.
[21:37:29] <skyl4rk> I'd probably be a c server kind of person, unless I thought perl was the more fitting language
[21:38:04] <skyl4rk> although maybe c++ instead of c
[21:38:25] <ngoldbaum> deadk: the trouble with C and C++ is you basically need a PhD and also be extremely vigilant at all times to avoid accidentally writing UB
[21:39:00] <ngoldbaum> sure there are tools that help but my impression is that even the experts are constantly writing UB and causing security issues
[21:39:29] * ngoldbaum looks at the shitshow that is Apple and ios these days…
[21:42:07] <deadk> it's much more that you need to be vigilant than you need a PhD. but i think it's not quite either; it's that at some point the program gets too complicated to model in one's head. you can write very tiny C programs easily, ones that are big enough to be useful are a bit more difficult, something the size of a web browser is probably impossible for any human however smart and careful
[21:43:57] <deadk> but pinning down the nature of C's problem aside, the problem is that rust has its own very scary problem in that it's impossible to write anything useful in rust without pulling in about five billion dependencies
[21:44:18] <ngoldbaum> i mean the same is true in C
[21:44:21] <gwozniak> yeah
[21:44:26] <deadk> it really isn't
[21:44:35] <ngoldbaum> you’re writing your own regex engine?
[21:44:35] <gwozniak> It's just that the dependencies are already on the system for you
[21:45:02] <gwozniak> Things like, "did you remember to put a newline at the end of the file?" are vigilance.  Deciphering a lot of the other stuff in the standard is pretty tricky
[21:45:07] <deadk> no, but POSIX provides one
[21:45:40] <deadk> but it's hard to depend on anything in C, so people tend to be much more conservative about doing it
[21:45:57] <gwozniak> So they write their own linked lists. Again and again.
[21:46:19] <ngoldbaum> people aren’t afraid to add C++ dependencies in my experience
[21:46:41] <ngoldbaum> C less so but also plenty of linux C stuff has very complicated dependency trees
[21:46:48] <ngoldbaum> and it’s a mess
[21:46:58] <manicennui> The thought that most problems requires C/C++ or Rust is silly.
[21:47:03] <ngoldbaum> rust just makes it more ergonomical to add dependencies
[21:47:07] <deadk> manicennui: oh, for sure
[21:47:19] <manicennui> s/requires/require/
[21:47:32] <manicennui> Geeks are annoying.
[21:47:55] <manicennui> These arguments are rarely about writing great software.
[21:48:18] <skyl4rk> manicennui: you mean most can be written in languages "known to be less performant"?
[21:48:24] <deadk> i can't think of any C thing i've built that's had as many dependencies as any rust program that speaks tls

[21:48:39] * ngoldbaum isn’t writing a web git frontend in rust either
[21:49:50] <deadk> the main reason you might use one of them is that most other languages need to reserve twice as much ram as they use and suck at doing very efficient IO
[21:54:13] <dimadima> fwiw it's probably cool to call into git directly from your web app
[21:54:41] <dimadima> using Git itself and not some other implementation or command line calls
[21:54:52] <deadk> if i were making a web app i'd probably want to explicitly avoid that
[21:54:59] <deadk> it seems like a good place to put some isolation
[21:55:20] *** Quits: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost) (Quit: mew wew)
[21:58:28] <manicennui> Just use libgit2. This is a solved problem.
[21:58:41] <manicennui> Or, argue about this nonsense endlessly.
[21:59:25] <deadk> yes, it's a solved problem if you want the thing that talks on the internet to dick around with git structures directly
[21:59:29] <deadk> but if you want that you're wrong
[22:01:05] <manicennui> I see you've chosen pointless bickering.
[22:01:13] <manicennui> Enjoy
[22:03:27] <dimadima> i think we could hash it out further
[22:03:32] * dimadima git joke
[22:06:46] <dimadima> i'd probably just call git CLI by interpolating arguments from the internet straight into CLI commands i build by concatenating strings
[22:09:17] <manicennui> good idea
[22:09:46] <ngoldbaum> https://media4.giphy.com/media/DBa308wq8XTMs/giphy.gif
[22:11:01] <dimadima> 'git er done!
[22:11:22] <gwozniak> string interpolation is the bees knees!
[22:11:23] <dimadima> in my enthusiasm i misplaced the apostrophe
[22:11:36] <dimadima> thanks gwozniak i think so too
[22:11:51] <gwozniak> It's fun, but mostly a bad idea, sadly
[22:14:22] <gwozniak> Along those lines: I wrote some logging in my compiler pass that added an indentation using the %* precision specifier for printf to do the indentation and it was incredibly slow
[22:14:59] <manicennui> Back in my day, we used string interpolation for SQL and command line arguments, and we liked it that way!
[22:15:03] <gwozniak> Since it only shows up in debugging output, it's acceptable, but using it in general would
[22:15:06] <gwozniak> be an issue
[22:15:33] <gwozniak> string interpolation and user input -> dumpster fire
[22:17:54] <dimadima> yeah just to be sure everyone understands i was joking along the sql injections / stack overflow answer line of joking
[22:23:22] <manicennui> Nah, I already did it in all of my code.
[22:23:27] <manicennui> Thanks a lot.
[22:53:53] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: agree Deepness.. >> A Fire...
[22:54:10] <riv> my memories not even good enough to know which was which
[22:54:20] <gerikson> it's fine
[22:54:38] <ngoldbaum> deepsness - spiders; fire - usenet
[22:54:41] <riv> I think gravitys ranbow was a bit wack
[22:54:44] <riv> i didnt finish it
[22:54:53] <riv> wait no
[22:54:56] <riv> not that
[22:55:13] <ngoldbaum> marooned in realtime is quite good
[22:55:25] <ngoldbaum> although it’s a sequel to another book that’s just OK
[22:56:47] <gerikson> Vinge is beloved by libertarians which I'm kinda leery of
[22:57:09] <gerikson> the Peace War was the one what introduced the null bubbles

[23:09:35] <manicennui> I support kitties wearing overalls

[23:13:52] *** Quits: damien3 (~damien@248.ip-149-56-13.net) (Quit: WeeChat 1.9.1)
[23:13:54] *** Quits: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:15:26] <manicennui> I bet overalls are really comfortable.
[23:15:41] <manicennui> I'm sure I wore them at some point as a child, but I don't remember them.
[23:40:35] <skyl4rk> overalls are nice, what I miss in mine is loops for a belt, or builtin pullstring to achieve the same kind of thing
[23:41:09] <skyl4rk> maybe pockets for kneepads
[23:41:36] <manicennui> Do you really need a belt with overalls?
[23:42:50] <skyl4rk> well perhaps not the kind that findus wears, but that is not what I personally associate with the term
[23:46:31] <skyl4rk> but yeah, if you bend over/stand/kneel/crouch a lot, the hips are a good place to "lock" your clothes, instead of just drape them from the shoulders and hope that it works itself out
[23:47:16] <skyl4rk> overall: https://img.byggshop.se/pimages/overall-blaklader-61511100__6c115b00-b34d-459d-b4ab-f336ab6d3abf.jpg
[23:49:25] <skyl4rk> seems the term in english also covers the kind of pant that has a "breastplate" and suspenders, and that might be a different thing, because suspenders can normally be adjusted
[23:54:23] <manicennui> Aren't those coveralls?
