[01:21:21] <systemfault> It also gives you a ton of utility functions (à la lodash) and they use "proper types" like "Option/Either" instead of returning undefined/null/-1
[01:21:41] <GreenJello> and Either means you can have typed errors
[01:22:36] <systemfault> And (it matters for me...) types are "first-party" unlike, I believe, lodash

[02:04:41] <entuland> that's not a good reason to try and sort out stuff in JS without knowing the basics (and such basic is pretty much the same as with other languages)
[02:05:47] <entuland> the fact that they are two separate files isn't meaningful either - if they're both loaded by the same page, and they put variables visible in the window scope, they should be able to interact and "see" each other's components

[02:29:14] *** Joins: nomic (~nomic@2a00:23c6:9910:1201:cdae:ea4b:93a4:1c59)
[02:30:36] <wroathe> kek_: You've already got the tools with the filter thing we discussed yesterday. It looks like the only thing you're missing is a routine that constructs a new object from the subset of keys you want in those larger objects
[02:31:29] <GreenJello> you could in theory skip parsing the JSON since filtering out keys only requires slice + concat
[02:31:57] <GreenJello> but you'd start with .map and see if the performance is unacceptable before trying this

[02:33:15] <wroathe> kek_: And then .filter().map(pickMessage); Since you've already filtered down the messages iterating over it again shouldn't be that big of a deal
[02:33:51] <wroathe> But if it is you can just do the whole thing in a forEach that pushes the messages you want into a new array and picks the keys at the same time

E.g. what you did makes sense if I see it but I'm too inexperienced (and also lack a lot of knowledge in js) to think of "yeah I could use this case of arrow function inside the map". E.g. you only provided part of the solution, currently I'm trying to figure out how to do it on one level higher and I just have way less tools in my head. I just know "I might be able to somehow

[03:28:40] <impliednude> entuland> something is interferring with the function from happening. not the onclick event. I tested with removing the function called *in this case PUM.open(1)* and put in console.log("the onclick event is working") and the console.log turns on for the right pages.

[03:31:42] <impliednude> nope. no errors at all.
[03:31:57] <impliednude> its just not calling it at all *Shrugs*
[03:32:14] <entuland> if the log happens also the call to open is happening
[03:32:22] <entuland> probably it's not doing what you expect
[03:32:29] <impliednude> its not if its called then calling the log

[03:39:02] <wroathe> kek_: And then click on the console and look at the object that it's logging.
[03:39:09] <kek_> entuland, nah that just gives me undefined so I figured that's because I don't have the () i.e. fucking up the mapping.

[03:42:42] <wroathe> kek_: See the result? That's the output you were asking for earlier.
[03:42:57] <kek_> wroathe, ah I tried that on an array. so now, what's the javascript way to apply such a function to an array of such objects? I first though I could use array.forEach but it's return type is undefined so I can't propagate any information "out of it".
[03:43:45] <wroathe> kek_: Huh? That's what this is doing.
[03:43:49] <wroathe> kek_: .map works on arrays
[03:43:53] <kek_> I tried to chain two maps() but that didn't work.
[03:44:10] <wroathe> n> [1, 3, 5].map(x => x ** 2);

[03:44:16] <wroathe> kek_: Study this carefully ^
[03:44:20] <entuland> it's not like you can't use forEach, it's that you'd have to use in a different way cause it won't take care of creating a new array for you
[03:44:41] <kek_> let me retry
[03:44:57] <wroathe> kek_: Retry what? Try to understand that code I just shared with you first.
[03:45:04] <wroathe> kek_: Just now in IRC.
[03:46:22] *** Quits: tex (~super@user/dix) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[03:46:29] <entuland> kek_, of course map() is the way to go there, but just to show how forEach() could achieve a similar behavior: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/3m1zxucn/ (check the console)
[03:47:31] <wroathe> Well, if .map was off the table I'd fall back to reduce
[03:47:41] <kek_> wroathe, I'd say I do get that map applies a given function to each element but that's not the hard part
[03:48:07] <entuland> it's not that it applies a function to each element, it also creates a new array with the result of each of those calls
[03:48:10] <wroathe> kek_: Ok, what's the hard part? That code I shared in that sandbox gives exactly the output you originally asked for.
[03:48:27] <entuland> not only*
[03:48:37] <wroathe> kek_: Ah, yes, maybe the piece you were missing is what entuland just said
[03:49:34] <entuland> the fiddle I shared is pretty much the same that map() would do, just creating and returning such an array for you without you populating it

[03:55:19] <kek_> wroathe, ah yeah that's the code you initially shared which is actually really nice. I then tried to apply that to an array of such objects. (sorry, I just confused myself)

[03:56:28] <kek_> wroathe, yeah, nah that's great but the actualy input I have is an array of such objects. So I tried to extend that to an arry of such json object, which I failed. then I mixed up those two issues I had, thus the impression I didn't look at the output.
[03:56:53] <kek_> but let me retry, might have had an insight
[03:57:03] <entuland> I asked a question the other day and I don't know if I got feedback and missed it, kek_ - wouldn't it be useful to put all of that data in a relational database if you're going to do a lot of handling?
[03:57:43] *** Joins: nomic (~nomic@2a00:23c6:9910:1201:cdae:ea4b:93a4:1c59)
[03:59:15] <kek_> entuland, nope, I don't need to query the data. sure one could do preprocessing before loading it into the actual application but then I think I'd rather use some document store. Also I'm generating a static homepage out of it, so I basically press "compile" and all that javascript that's needed for rendering won't be run afterwards.
[04:00:34] <entuland> well, if you're going to use a database of any sort, think very well whether you really want a document store. A relational database looks way better for that data.
[04:00:40] *** Joins: summersault (~summersau@2804:7f0:3886:c810:2130:6db7:5dde:9634)
[04:00:46] <entuland> sorry for the digression
[04:01:22] <wroathe> kek_: https://codesandbox.io/s/elastic-keller-3sw1v?file=/src/index.js
[04:01:26] <wroathe> kek_: Like so
[04:01:52] <wroathe> kek_: (ignore the clone stuff. that's just there so that the two objects in arr are different)
[04:02:18] <kek_> entuland, so what I do is: I scrape discord messages from some game's discord server. Like from all the devs. (no real reason, just for fun + I asked them). I get those json from those http calls. I store them, I read them into NuxtJS and generate my homepage. Resulting in this clunky, slow thing: https://paliapost.com/
[04:02:34] <wroathe> Man, this codesandbox thing is beautiful but a huge pain to use
[04:03:25] <entuland> so you're not going to keep a full trace of all the messages you get, only the most recent ones or something?
[04:04:09] *** Slade- is now known as Slade
[04:06:53] <entuland> my point is that if your data storage is going to grow and you'll keep using it all, it's safer to store it in a relational DB separating the data massaging required to put the data in the DB from the data massaging required to show it in the end page, with the advantage of faster and easier querying of large datasets (even just using sqlite with a single file)
[04:07:24] <kek_> entuland, what do you mean? I do intend to keep them but I do only scrape them each day. At some point, I'd probably have to limit it to "only get messages back 1 week" but that doesn't matter since if someone replys to a 2 week old message, I'd get that reply and thus the original message anyway since I do recursively follow the trail.
[04:07:56] <wroathe> kek_: Maybe this one is clearer: https://jsfiddle.net/1vx7t6j5/
[04:08:01] <entuland> the point is that keeping the data as JSON files is suboptimal for future queries
[04:08:10] <kek_> entuland, yeah sure at some point I guess that point is valid. especially since I want to add categories and thus indexing would be nice I guess?
[04:08:18] <entuland> absolutely
[04:08:33] <entuland> if ever you're going to use a DB, the sooner you add it, the better
[04:08:51] <kek_> entuland, the queries are really "dump" do, there is no complex relationship. but yeah for the point of simple processing, sure. probably.
[04:09:22] <kek_> entuland, I mean for now it's really just my fun side project I more or less do just for the fun of doing it ^^
[04:09:35] <entuland> sometimes you may want to get only the messages sent by a specific user, or messages containing specific text, or messages belonging to a specific channel and so forth
[04:09:42] <kek_> wroathe, sorry, that looks great and I noticed I think I really need to go back to some basics.

[08:13:59] <birkoff> why add event listener to entire body ?
[08:16:47] <wroathe> birkoff: Just for the example. You could add a div wrapping your option groups and bind it to that
[08:16:58] <wroathe> birkoff: It just needs to be bound to a common ancestor of your radios
[08:17:37] <birkoff> why not the radios themselves ? for event "click" ?
[08:17:47] <birkoff> well "change" is better I guess
[08:17:51] <wroathe> birkoff: Also, given that I responded almost two hours ago to you you should probably ping me if you want to get my attention. You got lucky that I happened to glance at my client :P
[08:18:12] <birkoff> right
[08:18:40] <wroathe> birkoff: What do you mean "why not the radios themselves"? This only requires a single event listener
[08:21:04] <wroathe> birkoff: This approach is 1. less code, 2. more elegant, 3. more efficient

[12:10:40] <Jonno_FTW> when I do a window.location.reload(true), it doesn't always reload everything, especially css
[12:10:58] <DnzAtWrk> that's normal
[12:11:09] <DnzAtWrk> firefox for example will normally not reload css or .html unless forced
[12:11:10] <Jonno_FTW> how do I force a reload of these things?
[12:11:19] <DnzAtWrk> or unless the css recently changed I think
[12:11:25] <Jonno_FTW> reload(true) should do a force reload though. I'm using chrome
[12:11:25] <DnzAtWrk> or unless the developer console is open I think
[12:11:34] <DnzAtWrk> maybe if the stars are aligned correctly it will also reload
[12:11:55] <Jonno_FTW> I know that chrome gives you the force reload options when dev tools are open, but I need to push changes to users

[13:59:33] <makara> "The Buffer class is within the global scope, making it unlikely that one would need to ever use require('buffer').Buffer."
[14:00:00] <makara> so i don't import it, and then i get "The moduleSpecifier "buffer" has no scheme but we will try to resolve it as remote module."
[14:00:08] <makara> and it fails

[18:50:40] <comatory> alien_lappy: I think generally "aborting requests" is not something that is possible via DOM APIs until recently with AbortController. You could probably do a fetch via JS and create img element after it has fetched the image with possibility to cancel the request.
[18:51:28] <comatory> alien_lappy: It sounds a bit strange why would you actually want to abort loading the image anyway? If you change `src` attribute for image to empty, the image is not visible anymore. Isn't that enough?
[18:51:34] <shailangsa> does anybody know if it's possible to add javascript to a joomla login form where if the username matches a string, redirect them elsewhere otherwise continue logging in?
[18:52:35] <comatory> shailangsa: not familiar with joomla but why would not be possible to just add javascript inline (or include it somehow) and just handle it yourself?
[18:54:36] <shailangsa> when adding the javascript, how to let it continue logging in using the joomla's system when the criteria is not met?
[18:55:48] <comatory> shailangsa: why don't you just listen to changes in login form username field and when you detect a certain pattern, do a redirect via javascript (window.location = 'http:/...')?
[18:56:56] <shailangsa> else it would continue logging into joomla as normal?
[18:58:23] <comatory> shailangsa: you're not really clear about what you're trying to achieve. Form the way you wrote it, it sounds to me like "I have a login form with username field. If username matches certain pattern, redirect user to some page." I assume the form has a login button so if you do not redirect the user, the user stays on the page with login form, finished entering credentials and logs in.

[19:00:13] <shailangsa> is it possible to listen on in the login form so that if the username matches a certain string, login using usernamex/passwordx?
[19:00:19] <comatory> shailangsa: To me it sounds like you want to run some check on given username and decide what to do next. Data for users lives in database so you probably want to do this on backend. I am not familiar with Joomla. I don't think changing anything on browser side will help you unless it's something very simple.

[19:39:09] <comatory> Honestly I haven't used it too much and if I wanted to, I'd probably read up more how to use that specific profiling so I'd know what it can and can't do and how to interpret the data.
[19:39:14] <alien_lappy> comatory: so, the reason is this, if the user clicks next, the current image (processed image with some progressive, so it comes in slow-ish), needs to abort, in order to not trigger all the events associated and then keep "loading" state for the next image... but more importantly, ...

[19:40:44] <alien_lappy> comatory: so, i've already rewritten stuff so it regularly checks abort status, so it can immediately stop
[19:41:55] <alien_lappy> the thing we get now is that the old one is still busy on server (which also takes resources, which also is a big issue), but then the session also having blocking issues, which means the new image only starts after the old one is finished... which makes them wait even longer...
[19:42:39] <alien_lappy> i've already done stuff with the ajax calls to handle aborts, but now i'm stuck on image loading on firefox
[19:42:55] <comatory> alien_lappy: Well speaking from the front end side, I think you're doing it a bit backwards. If you have hooked bunch of listeners on the old IMG element, you should also clean them up if it can cause trouble. So maybe on frontend the solution would be to remove all listeners. That way even if request finishes, the listener callback does not trigger and nothing happens. On backend side, you can
[19:42:56] <comatory> probably figure this one out by keeping some kind of queue which user is triggering what and introduce some quota. If you're worried about ppl overcrowding server, just introduce some kind of rate limiting.
[19:43:28] *** Quits: nomic (~nomic@2a00:23c6:9910:1201:cdae:ea4b:93a4:1c59) (Client Quit)
[19:44:06] <comatory> alien_lappy: To me it seems like the "right way" to handle things, basically when you don't need something, clean it up, call API endpoint and let backend know that you're moving onto something new. I think there's some indirection that is introduced by trying to "cancel request". Anyways, look into AbortController, it's a new browser API that actually let's you cancel out requests. I think
[19:44:08] <comatory> that would work for you.

[19:44:50] <alien_lappy> comatory: so, if you have a list of images and you are looking for the 4th one, and you skip to the next 3, you basically load the stuff and if each image would take 15secs then even though after 3secs you're on the 4th request, they all seem to wait on session blockage then thus you get the result only after 1 minute

[19:48:18] <comatory> alien_lappy: It kind of sounds like your system is not designed to handle that, so maybe you should look into that. You say you already have sessions on backend so you keep some state of what is happenning. Perhaps every time you "skip" something on frontend, you can call API endpoint and just mark processing for specifing document as "skipped" or "paused" or something like that.

[20:02:02] <MJCD> lol, no.
[20:03:53] <alien_lappy> well, the original question was: "does anyone know how to abort a specific img loading in firefox? i'm rewriting my server side to actually react on an abort event, but apparenly just setting src to '' doesn't actually abort the image loading (like in some other browsers)"
[20:04:42] <alien_lappy> i guess it got bogged down on why i want that
[20:06:04] <alien_lappy> i've already done the aborts with the xhr ajax calls, now i need to abort the image that is loading
[20:06:26] <alien_lappy> i got it working for chrome, with setting src=''
[20:06:38] <alien_lappy> but doesn't work for FF, apparently
[20:07:03] <alien_lappy> MJCD: i'm not perfect, but i try to ask a concise question
[20:07:22] <wroathe> alien_lappy: AFAIK there is no standard mechanism for doing that. The fact that some browsers abort loading when you set the src to an empty string is just a vendor-specific detail
[20:07:28] <MJCD> remove the img element from the dom.
[20:07:29] <MJCD> done.
[20:07:36] <comatory> alien_lappy: Each browser producer implements things a bit differently so relying on that will not give you exact results everytime.
[20:07:43] <MJCD> upon abort on client side
[20:07:50] <MJCD> nothing backend literally at all
[20:08:00] <alien_lappy> wroathe: comatory: that is what i found out
[20:08:02] <MJCD> if anything you should have most of your "assets" on a CDN
[20:08:07] <alien_lappy> MJCD: great, i'll try that
[20:08:38] <comatory> MJCD: Well there's that situation where img with src already exists and initiates request to server anyway. Removing the element will not get rid of the request really.
[20:08:54] <MJCD> the request is irrelevant
[20:08:58] <MJCD> it will resolve, or it won't
[20:09:06] <MJCD> you've already aborted in the frontend
[20:09:16] <MJCD> so it's discarded in either case :)

[21:06:03] <MJCD> le sigh
[21:06:07] <jaawerth> FightingFalcon: well, you can pass it as an arg, or two functions can share variables via a closure, but if they're defined separately, no. that kind of closure scope isolation is actually considered to be a good thing
[21:06:34] <MJCD> have a fantastic night and i'm glad the OP actually got an answer that seems to have helped them to the point they're not asking anything right now
[21:06:36] <FightingFalcon> jaawerth, as far as i know, if you declare a variable without anything, it automatically becomes global
[21:06:37] <FightingFalcon> like
[21:06:42] <FightingFalcon> myvar = 100;
[21:06:43] <MJCD> That's what i'm all about
[21:06:44] <FightingFalcon> instead of
[21:06:47] <MJCD> gnhf
[21:06:48] <FightingFalcon> var myvar = 100;
[21:06:50] <jaawerth> implicit globals? sure
[21:06:50] <FightingFalcon> or let mmyvar
[21:06:58] <jaawerth> that's in non-strict mode, aka "mistake mode"
[21:07:17] <jaawerth> in strict mode, implicit globals assignment will throw an error
[21:07:21] *** Quits: HaMsTeRs (~HaMsTeRs@210.3.201.132) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:07:47] <jaawerth> globals are best avoided - usually if you find yourself needing to do this in a function it's often a sign that the function should probably broken down into smaller component functions
[21:08:02] <MJCD> !globals
[21:08:02] <jellobot> MJCD, It's best to avoid global variables. As variables lose scope, they will be eligible for garbage collection. If they are scoped globally, then they will not be eligible for collection until the global namespace loses scope (e.g. when the page unloads). See also !IIFE and !modules
[21:08:36] <FightingFalcon> hm
[21:08:51] <MJCD> ie encapsulate your variables :)

[21:09:15] *** Joins: HaMsTeRs (~HaMsTeRs@210.3.201.132)
[21:09:25] <MJCD> at most a module should IDEALLY export a single variable, with all it's own variables needed, inside the class/module itself

[21:14:32] <FightingFalcon> i made an anti-spam system. My form is hidden. When a user clicks to unhide the form, JS sets md5 code of the website. And when the form is submitted, php compares md5 code of the site to the value submitted by the form. As spam bots will not click to unhide the form, it must work?

[23:23:21] <ljharb> what is reactos
[23:23:22] <samsch> adhd typing ^
[23:23:32] <ljharb> reactjs did yes
[23:23:40] <ljharb> but I’m not sure fb owns it yet
[23:24:50] <samsch> ReactOS is other project that was called "React" long before FB's React, that owns the #react (or ##react maybe) channel on freenode. And regularly had to redirect people to #reactjs and were kinda (rightfully) frustrated about having their name stomped on.
