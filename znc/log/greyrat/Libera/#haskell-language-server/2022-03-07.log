[01:13:38] <drsooch[m]> Is GHC2021 enabled anywhere in the HLS codebase?
[01:15:53] <fendor[m]> I suppose not, since we support ghc versions that don't support that language extension?
[01:16:31] <drsooch[m]> For whatever reason BinaryLiterals is enabled in the alternate number format golden tests in 9.2.1. From my understanding it has to be explicitly enabled am I missing something?
[01:16:50] <drsooch[m]> * whatever reason `BinaryLiterals, * BinaryLiterals`, *  extension is enabled
[01:18:55] <fendor[m]> what's the question? I don't believe GHC2021 is specified anywhere, so you have to explicitly enable BinaryLiterals? Seems sensible to me at a glance
[01:21:13] <drsooch[m]> The test files do not have BinaryLiterals enabled, but for whatever reason the code actions are acting as if it is enabled
[01:26:08] <fendor[m]> ah, I see. Maybe the plugin enables it? Or it suggests binary literals and afterwards you would get an compile error?
[01:27:31] <fendor[m]> I see that test/testdata/TIntDtoB.hs has BinaryLiterals enabled
[01:27:36] <drsooch[m]> For reference I wrote it haha.
[01:28:23] <drsooch[m]> Yes there are files that explicitly test for BinaryLiterals but for instance `TFindLiteralIntPattern` should only generate hex and octal formats 
[01:28:59] <drsooch[m]> I guess I'll patch it with a `NoBinaryLiterals` and come back to it
[01:31:36] <fendor[m]> yeah, I remember ;D 
[01:31:52] <fendor[m]> maybe we enable them somewhere in ghcide by default?
[01:32:30] <drsooch[m]> I grep'd and found no mentions of GHC2021 (which enabled BinaryLiterals) and BinaryLiterals itself which is just my test suite
[01:34:26] <fendor[m]> Why do you think it shouldn't generate binary literals?
[01:34:57] <drsooch[m]> The code action only provides alternatives when their extensions are enabled
[01:35:31] <drsooch[m]> Which I want to change but for now that's the expected result
[01:36:29] <fendor[m]> Ah, now I finally understand the issue
[01:40:34] <fendor[m]> drsooch: For me, your plugin doesn't suggest really binary literals, only hexadecimal and octal which apparently is a feature since Haskell98
[01:40:43] <drsooch[m]> which version?
[01:40:45] <drsooch[m]> ghc I mean
[01:41:15] <fendor[m]> I use ghc 8.10.7
[01:41:28] <drsooch[m]> yeah everything <9.2.1 is fine
[01:42:46] <fendor[m]> From https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0372-ghc-extensions.rst#proposed-change-specification
[01:42:52] <fendor[m]> > When ghc is used without an explicit language choice, the latest GHC20xx known to GHC is used. 
[01:43:06] <drsooch[m]> ouch...
[01:43:16] <fendor[m]> Maybe related?
[01:43:55] <drsooch[m]> I'd imagine, code actions in normal files don't give binary literals. And now I'm seeing failures in other numeric extensions as well

[18:18:35] <fendor[m]> I can't seem to overwrite the reviewer requirement for hie-bios, shouldn't I be able to do that?
[18:19:00] <fendor[m]> talking about this PR https://github.com/haskell/hie-bios/pull/338. After it is merged, I am going to make a release
[18:23:18] <michaelpj> fendor: are you an admin on that repo? if not, you probably shouldn't be able to
[18:23:30] <fendor[m]> I should be admin, afaict
[18:23:53] <michaelpj> oh, I don't think you can do it on a case-by-case basis, but I think you can just go to the settings, turn it off, and then turn it on again
[18:24:03] <michaelpj> tbh I am not 100% sold on it as a thing
[18:24:05] * fendor[m] uploaded an image: (16KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/TTVQFdLynPTapnrXUkAFhJNb/image.png >
[18:25:14] <fendor[m]> to me disabling the review requirement?
[18:27:48] <fendor[m]> or the error message cange in hie-bios? 
[18:30:33] <michaelpj> on all PRs requiring a review from someone else
[18:30:51] <michaelpj> I have no opinion on your PR :)
[18:33:10] <fendor[m]> yeah, I agree in general... Well, maerwald approved, maybe we should add him to the repository s.t. his approval counts?
[18:36:12] <michaelpj> you're the repo admin, not me ;) but I'm generally pro giving out commit rights

[18:40:53] <michaelpj> at this point I think the process is whatever the maintainers do ;)
