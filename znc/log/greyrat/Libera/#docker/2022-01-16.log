[01:10:40] <Sabinno> Hey folks. I'm REALLY frustrated and extremely confused today. I am not new to Docker at all (2 years experience now), but I just started out with swarm. I'm trying to write a Traefik 2 Swarm stack with a whoami container to test. Why on *earth* does Traefik not show me the whoami server when accessed? Config: https://pastebin.com/zEyPfrP2
[01:11:11] <Sabinno> My existing Traefik config on another server, not in Swarm mode, is almost identical to this one and works perfectly.

[01:28:59] <Sabinno> tabakhase: Unfortunately, adding the `reverse-proxy` network did me no good. Still "404" on Traefik.
[01:29:32] <tabakhase> enable traefik admin/dashboard and see what it discovers...
[01:34:21] <Sabinno> tabakhase: I'd love to. I guess the problem with that is that I can't see the dashboard using Traefik. :D
[01:36:07] <Sabinno> Yeah, so I went ahead and enabled the dashboard

[02:36:36] <dmj`> tabakhase: I'm using gitlab CI, and volumes won't mount because of docker-in-docker, which is fine, I can just do it locally, but I don't want to try to mount otherwise
[02:37:00] <dmj`> tabakhase: but yes my current approach is editing the docker compose file
[02:38:12] <tabakhase> dmj` gitlab-ci user myself, so im not sure about your "volumes won't mount because of docker-in-docker" o.O  -- are you maybe not actually using dind, but but a exposed host .sock? that used to be an older method...
[02:38:37] <dmj`> tabakhase: I am using dind
[02:39:00] <dmj`> tabakhase: build works fine locally, but when run in CI the test golden files are not found
[02:39:07] <dmj`> the volume mounts the golden files
[02:39:15] <tabakhase> dmj` and ye editing then is a bit fugly - using the merge feature is likely best - this a) works automagically for that override-yml, but also b) programatically with whatever number of yaml files you want, using "-f" or setting COMPOSE_FILE env-var
[02:40:44] <tabakhase> so you can "pick together your app" by setting COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yml:docker-bindmounts.yml:docker-extradb.yml" or such (this value can also be stored in the ".env" file)
[02:41:09] <dmj`> tabakhase: that'd be cool if you could template the docker-compose file
[02:42:05] <tabakhase> most stuff you can model with just using $Vars in there, where that doesnt cut it merging yaml files comes in^^

[02:49:09] <dmj`> tabakhase: I shared it works fine locally, but not in CI, the test files are found on the mount, file not found most likely means the volume isn't mounted. It's a fair assumption
[02:49:19] <tabakhase> (and call em bindmounts if thats what they are + yes those should work just fine in dind (((as under the hood the build folder of your docker executor is in a volume, and any service containers share volumes of the buildcontainer - so things are transparent both ways)
[02:50:14] <tabakhase> so, your compose shall have "./paths:/things" - no "/bla:/others"

Furthermore in the 'mysql' db, table 'user' row 'host' I've got four entries '%' and 3x 'localhost'. I believe that '%' allows me to connect from outside the docker system.
[14:31:14] <malmalmal> Now I am trying to user DBeaver to establish a connection providing 'localhost', port '3306', database name, user 'root' and either decclaring or not declaring password, but it tells me localhost is rejecting user root
[14:31:24] <malmalmal> Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'
[14:32:40] <malmalmal> So I assume I am doing something wrong with the connection. As apache is also mapped to localhost (and can be accessed from host browser in localhost) it may be I am telling the db manager to connect to apache instead of mysql
[14:32:54] <malmalmal> anyone can shed a bit of light on this please? thank you
[14:41:02] <malmalmal> Ok, ran lsof on host, docker-pr showed port 3307, switching port to 3307 on mysql manager solved it.

[15:38:04] <arash> Hello, I run a container, its a PHP app, how can I edit those files? should I stop container and then edit them or I can edit them live?
[15:38:53] <ikke> arash: you can mount a local volume in the container that contains the files
[15:39:09] <ikke> I mean, a local bind mount
[15:39:53] <arash> ikke, how can I do it? is there any tutorial? I'm using windows
[15:43:56] <ikke> I have no experience with docker on windows
[15:50:53] <wez> Yeah, don't use Windows :)
