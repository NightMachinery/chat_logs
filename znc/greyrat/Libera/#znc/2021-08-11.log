[03:08:01] <gothkat> Ok looks like a web interface bug. i can set the password including spaces with the addservers command, but the next time I edit the user in the web interface it discards half the password field again
[03:10:25] <gothkat> Actually it is even in the raw text field. Just the javascript that pretties up the "servers of this IRC network"

[03:18:46] <DarthGandalf> and even sends the password to IRC server correctly, prefixed with : ?
[03:19:43] <gothkat> I don't actually know for sure if it is prefixed. undernet accepts it. But it wouldn't surprise me if their ircd is sloppy and doesn't enforce the need for a : in this context. Want me to double check?
[03:20:32] <gothkat> Doesn't look to be written by *raw
[03:21:43] <DarthGandalf> Could you please send PR to fix the JS then?
[03:22:26] <gothkat> That is beyond my abilities. I can troubleshoot some but I can't write JavaScript. 
[03:30:14] <gothkat> Ok... I think it is line = line.split(" "); that does the split and then var pass = line[2] || ""; which sets the password. Since it is splitting at whitespace and then only taking element [2]? it needs to take more lines if they exist and append them separated by spaces?
[03:31:35] <gothkat> webadmin.js around line 145
[03:32:25] <DarthGandalf> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
[03:32:33] <DarthGandalf> pass the correct limit instead
[03:33:33] <gothkat> That won't help either. "but stops when limit entries have been placed in the array. Any leftover text is not included in the array at all"
[03:33:54] <gothkat> I think?
[03:35:48] <DarthGandalf> hmm
[03:36:57] <gothkat> add a loop to keep appending line[x] plus a space, increment x and repeat until we run out? 
[03:36:59] <gothkat> i'm a manager not a programmer.
[03:37:36] <gothkat> Or just regex the whole thing from the start, because regex makes everything better and never causes any additional problems
[03:38:48] <DarthGandalf> s/(.)\1/$1$1$1/
[03:38:48] <ZNC-Linker> DarthGandalf meant: “hmmm”
[03:40:16] <gothkat> ^(.*?) (.*?) (.*) maybe? group 1 would be the server, 2 the port number with optional + and 3 would be the password which is everything else
[03:40:40] <DarthGandalf> no, that won't work if there are not enough spaces
[03:42:41] <gothkat> Oh right. see. this is why you ask a programmer for programming advice. 
[03:43:22] *** Joins: riddle (riddle@user/riddle)
[03:43:36] <DarthGandalf> maybe JS editor should just pass the data via separate fields
[03:43:42] <DarthGandalf> and the backend should handle both cases separately
[03:43:58] *** Quits: Zoddo (uid143276@user/zoddo) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[03:45:14] <gothkat> I think the problem is only parsing data into the frontend. let me double check that.
[03:47:09] <gothkat> The JS does construct the correct text field. it is only when it parses the textfield from the server that here is a problem
[03:47:53] <gothkat> The backend could do the parsing and send a textfield for non-JS and pre-parsed structured data for JS to read I guess? Seems overkill since it would need changes in two places
[03:48:51] <gothkat> But because it parses wrong and writes that back, all you need to do to break your configuration is edit the user in the web editor and hit save and you lose data.
[03:49:08] <DarthGandalf> yeah

[17:44:11] <Koragg> I have pastebinned strange notify behavior, here RAW 600 is triggered (by a non-existant entry entirely): https://pastebin.com/7Ng9zv6A
[17:44:39] <Koragg> https://pastebin.com/q96DvtuG <--- confirmed that the notify entry (nick: why) is not "subscribed to" at all: https://pastebin.com/q96DvtuG
[17:45:07] <Koragg> [15:14] <*status> No such module watch <--- I checked in my webpanel as well, *watch is NOT loaded
[17:45:25] <Koragg> as this issue occurs cross-clients, it seems to be znc related
[17:45:43] <MetaNova> not everything cross-client is ZNC-specific, mind
[17:46:07] <MetaNova> "friends list" (MONITOR, ISON, plain WHO/WHOIS) for example
[17:46:33] <Koragg> AdiIRC's notify list as it is called is cleared, no entries, Weechat's notify list is also cleared (no entries)
[17:47:26] <MetaNova> https://pastebin.com/7Ng9zv6A indicates those are both sent from the server to ZNC/client
[17:47:37] <MetaNova> curious
[17:47:59] <Koragg> yeah but shouldn't in my on connect stuff be a confirmation that "why is now on your watch list" etc? there is a numeric for that I think
[17:48:05] <Koragg> (perhaps wrong wording but yeah)
[17:49:22] <MetaNova> well, if the nick "why" was put into your "friends list" (notify list, whatever) then the raw/debug output should, at some point, show ZNC (on behalf of your client) specifying that
[17:49:51] <MetaNova> we shouldn't dismiss the possibility icq-chat does something special/unique
[17:50:17] <Koragg> they use InspIRCd-3 incase this helps pinpointing it down
[17:50:22] <MetaNova> hm
[17:51:47] <Koragg> I wouldn't want to go so far as to claim there is a bug in the watch or monitor module (they do have both) but this behavior seems very odd, as there is no "approval" that the nick on the "notify list" is being requested by znc, my client, or anything, it just happens
[17:52:50] <Koragg> oh I fixed it, but in an odd way
[17:52:56] <Koragg> I reconnected the znc as a whole
[17:53:09] <Koragg> (it has not disconnected since I added and removed the client-sided "notify" entries)
[17:53:16] <Koragg> so it was somehow "stale" on the IRCd side
[17:53:27] <MetaNova> ah. I see.
[17:54:39] <Koragg> this does imply an IRCd sided bug though (/watch entries are not cleared until the client, the znc in this case, disconnects) (adi uses /watch rather than /monitor if both are available)
[17:55:04] <MetaNova> I'm not sure that qualifies as a bug
[17:55:24] <MetaNova> the server has no knowledge or indication that a client attaches/detaches from ZNC
[17:55:38] *** Joins: volki57 (~volki57@95.70.134.1)
[17:55:54] <MetaNova> as far as it knows, ZNC (the client) simply remains connected, meaning watch entries persist until the client reconnects
[17:56:24] <MetaNova> well, bug on the ircd side, anyway
[17:57:00] <MetaNova> I think there might be an open issue about ZNC maintaining a more curated watch list per attached client, though
[17:59:34] <Koragg> I am thinking as the znc never disconnected, the IRCd was still keeping track of the WATCH entry, poked Insp devs about it, can't hurt to at least see what they respond with
[17:59:48] <Koragg> (I'm thinking this would happen with any client that is always-on)
[18:00:24] <MetaNova> right
[18:00:31] <MetaNova> ZNC is just another client to the IRC server
[18:00:48] <MetaNova> and I'm nearly 100% certain there's nothing to be done on the IRCd-side of things about this
[18:00:55] <Koragg> yup, I am thinking it would have also done this for e.g. IRCCloud in premium tier, and I just happened to stumble onto it with ZNC heh
[18:01:14] <Koragg> luckily I do at least know which workaround to employ if I should be in this peculiar situation again
[18:01:45] <MetaNova> the "correct approach" (as correct as possible, anyway) would be to have ZNC actively curate the watch/monitor/ison list (communicating with the server, adding/removing entries as necessary) based on attaching/detaching clients
[18:02:13] <MetaNova> but even then, I'm beginning to talk about things I'm less familiar with
[18:02:35] <MetaNova> such as if the watch/monitor/ison list can even have a nick removed by an active connection

[18:09:07] <Koragg> actually yes it can be, usually prefixing the nick with a - e.g. /watch -nickname (but /monitor - nickname as it looks). also I noticed that znc uses unknown-nick for when the nickname is not yet known (e.g. for CAP dance). shouldn't it use * as placeholder for an unknown nickname?
