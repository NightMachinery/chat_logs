[01:06:29] <havenwood> nakilon: for reconnection, close the server onerror and reconnect onclose.
[01:06:38] <havenwood> nakilon: like https://github.com/socketry/async-websocket/blob/v0.19.0/examples/utopia/pages/client/client.js#L30-L43
[01:08:29] <havenwood> nakilon: hem, when you're not inside a reactor already, an `Async do` is like `Async::Reactor.new.run do`.
[01:09:27] <havenwood> nakilon: you need the block because the reactor closes when the block closes.
[01:09:52] <havenwood> lemme think, can you manually close it? I've never seen that pattern.
[01:12:02] <havenwood> nakilon: yes, looking at the code it looks like you can do: task = Async::Reactor.new
[01:12:14] <havenwood> nakilon: then: task.async do
[01:13:49] <havenwood> and: task.close
[01:13:56] <havenwood> maybe name it reactor and use #run

[04:06:47] <jaredo> honestly, ruby wouldn't be my first choice for a desktop app
[04:07:18] <jaredo> its my favorite language, by far, but every language has a niche and desktop apps isn't ruby's forte
[04:08:36] <fredlinhares> I see, I think I will use C++.
[04:09:40] <jaredo> that's probably what I would do

[04:17:04] <fredlinhares> I learned C++ in 2004, so I am used even to old C++.

[08:56:03] <Al-Khwarizmi> This and the IEEEtran.cls file define the components of your paper [title, text, heads, etc.]. *CRITICAL: Do Not Use Symbols, Special Characters, Footnotes, 
[08:56:06] <Al-Khwarizmi> or Math in Paper Title or Abstract.

[08:56:19] <Al-Khwarizmi> \section{Introduction}
[08:56:21] <Al-Khwarizmi> This document is a model and instructions for \LaTeX.
[08:56:24] <Al-Khwarizmi> Please observe the conference page limits. 
[08:56:26] <Al-Khwarizmi> \section{Ease of Use}
[08:56:29] <Al-Khwarizmi> \subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}
[08:56:31] <Al-Khwarizmi> The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
[08:56:34] <Al-Khwarizmi> column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
[08:56:37] <Al-Khwarizmi> alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
[08:56:39] <Al-Khwarizmi> measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
[08:56:42] <Al-Khwarizmi> and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
[08:56:44] <Al-Khwarizmi> as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
[08:56:47] <Al-Khwarizmi> Please do not revise any of the current designations.
[08:56:49] <Al-Khwarizmi> \section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
[08:56:52] <Al-Khwarizmi> Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
[08:56:54] <Al-Khwarizmi> separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
[08:56:57] <Al-Khwarizmi> formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
[08:57:00] <Al-Khwarizmi> proofreading, spelling and grammar.
[08:57:02] <Al-Khwarizmi> Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
[08:57:05] <Al-Khwarizmi> formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
[08:57:07] <Al-Khwarizmi> for you.
[08:57:10] <Al-Khwarizmi> \subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
[08:57:12] <Al-Khwarizmi> Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
[08:57:15] <Al-Khwarizmi> even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
[08:57:17] <Al-Khwarizmi> IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
[08:57:20] <Al-Khwarizmi> abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.
[08:57:22] <Al-Khwarizmi> \subsection{Units}
[08:57:25] <Al-Khwarizmi> \begin{itemize}
[08:57:27] <Al-Khwarizmi> \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
[08:57:31] <Al-Khwarizmi> \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
[08:57:35] <Al-Khwarizmi> \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
[08:57:39] <Al-Khwarizmi> \item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
[08:57:42] <Al-Khwarizmi> \end{itemize}
[08:57:45] <Al-Khwarizmi> \subsection{Equations}
[08:57:47] <Al-Khwarizmi> Number equations consecutively. To make your 
[08:57:50] <Al-Khwarizmi> equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
[08:57:52] <Al-Khwarizmi> appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
[08:57:55] <Al-Khwarizmi> but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
[08:57:57] <Al-Khwarizmi> sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
[08:58:00] <Al-Khwarizmi> sentence, as in:
[08:58:02] <Al-Khwarizmi> \begin{equation}
[08:58:05] <Al-Khwarizmi> a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
[08:58:07] <Al-Khwarizmi> \end{equation}
[08:58:10] <Al-Khwarizmi> Be sure that the 
[08:58:12] <Al-Khwarizmi> symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
[08:58:15] <Al-Khwarizmi> the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
[08:58:18] <Al-Khwarizmi> the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''
[08:58:20] <Al-Khwarizmi> \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}
[08:58:23] <Al-Khwarizmi> Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
[08:58:25] <Al-Khwarizmi> of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
[08:58:28] <Al-Khwarizmi> to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
[08:58:30] <Al-Khwarizmi> citations without having to go through the file line by line.
[08:58:33] <Al-Khwarizmi> Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
[08:58:35] <Al-Khwarizmi> \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
[08:58:38] <Al-Khwarizmi> environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.
[08:58:40] <Al-Khwarizmi> Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
[08:58:43] <Al-Khwarizmi> will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
[08:58:45] <Al-Khwarizmi> equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
[08:58:48] <Al-Khwarizmi> article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
[08:58:50] <Al-Khwarizmi> the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
[08:58:53] <Al-Khwarizmi> counting.
[08:58:55] <Al-Khwarizmi> {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
[08:58:58] <Al-Khwarizmi> data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
[08:59:00] <Al-Khwarizmi> bibliography you must send the .bib files. 
[08:59:03] <Al-Khwarizmi> {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
[08:59:05] <Al-Khwarizmi> subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
[08:59:08] <Al-Khwarizmi> referenced as Table IV-B3. 
[08:59:10] <Al-Khwarizmi> {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
[08:59:13] <Al-Khwarizmi> \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
[08:59:15] <Al-Khwarizmi> supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
[08:59:18] <Al-Khwarizmi> cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
[08:59:20] <Al-Khwarizmi> should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

[21:53:39] <micah> i am doing `bundle install` in a app directory, it installs rake (among other things), but then when I do `bundle exec rake assets:precompile` it tries to use the rake installed on the system, which is the wrong version.
[21:53:50] <micah> how can I tell bundle to use the one installed via `bundle install` ?
[21:55:29] <adam12> micah: what's the error you're getting?

[22:13:30] <micah> adam12: thanks for the help!
[22:15:40] <adam12> micah: did you get it to work?
[22:15:41] <analogsalad> havenwood: Not sure if this is the appropriate place for this question but is Roda a better choice for a new project? Seems more active on first glance.
[22:16:06] <adam12> analogsalad: I use Roda on multiple large projects. It works well, for the most part.
[22:17:32] <analogsalad> adam12: It certainly looks like something I'm looking for, I need a bare bones toolkit basically.
[22:22:00] <analogsalad> Btw, I'm coming to Ruby from another language. Any must-have dev tools I should be aware of? Linting, testing etc.
[22:23:01] <adam12> analogsalad: standardrb for linting (it builds on Rubocop, the basic defacto). Minitest for testing (tho some people prefer the DSL of RSpec). Definitely checkout the newly released Debug gem.
[22:25:26] <analogsalad> adam12: Thanks! I'll check them out. And to keep gems project specific and not global, it seems bundler is the standard, correct?
[22:25:41] <adam12> analogsalad: Yes. Stick everything in your Gemfile.
[22:26:28] <analogsalad> adam12: Is there a way to add things like standardrb as a "dev" dependency on Gemfiles?
[22:26:36] <adam12> analogsalad: Add it to the `development` group.
[22:26:50] <analogsalad> adam12, gotcha.
