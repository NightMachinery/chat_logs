[01:09:42] <sd_> 04<R​ootbear75> I didn't disconnect from discord, I finished my project and left. Instead of bringing your personal opinions to a simple fucking question just answer it and leave it there.

[01:09:45] <sd_> 09<Q​uasky> Honestly, There are a few profs and staff members that play games with students and/or assist with student orgs, so there are a few rouge steam installs around.
[01:10:04] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: so that neuters the argument right there, since pre-early 2020 exploit covers a huge swath of 'supported' platforms

[01:10:40] <sd_> 09<Q​uasky> I don't mind really. They don't get treated any differently when it comes time to reimage and swap computers. And all of them are pretty cool about it
[01:10:52] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: so again, that neuters the generation cutoff being because of chipset key argument right there
[01:11:08] <Hunterkll> and we go right back to HVCI being a performance killer on anything below 7th gen

[01:12:14] <sd_> 09<H​aise> so I can install whatever the fuck I want lol
[01:12:23] <Hunterkll> so we get right back to the real reason: HVCI enabled makes your system performance suck, and microsoft is attempting to mandate it entirely to styme malware 
[01:12:38] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00213.html
[01:12:47] <Hunterkll> you'll note the guidance was u pdated a year later after disclosure to cover more areas
[01:12:56] <sd_> 09<Q​uasky> I had a box in my homelab that I could RDP into, but I turned it off since I'd have brute force attacks all day long. Thought about putting it behind a gateway or different port, but It'd just end up the same.

[01:13:39] <sd_> 09<H​aise> if I'm outside of lab network
[01:14:10] <shibboleth> Hunterkll, seems intel claimed the issue was fixed > kaby, but wasn't.
[01:14:18] <Hunterkll> different attack
[01:14:28] <Hunterkll> same result, but different actual issue
[01:14:47] <shibboleth> so... same issue, diff vector
[01:14:54] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: either way, kaby lake is 7th gen
[01:14:58] <shibboleth> mhm
[01:15:03] <Hunterkll> which..... is allowed in a lot of areas in Win11 as minimum 
[01:15:10] <Hunterkll> so that still makes it a non-argument
[01:15:25] <Hunterkll> and we get back to the fact that HVCI does NOT kill performance on 7th gen, but does on 6th
[01:15:25] <shibboleth> again with the circular reasoning :)
[01:15:31] <Hunterkll> not really
[01:15:58] <Hunterkll> your argument falls flat on its face when Win11 allows supposedly already vulnerable platforms 
[01:16:08] <Hunterkll> and you're trying to say the cutoff was to get rid of those p latforms 
[01:16:20] <sd_> 09<Q​uasky> I've looked at some lab VPN stuffis, but since I moved our ISP killed my modem and we have to buy a new one. Just haven't gotten around to it yet.

[01:17:06] <shibboleth> <shibboleth> <shibboleth> Hunterkll, or that < = kaby platform keys were exposed with plundervolt
[01:17:09] <shibboleth> ok, and/or
[01:17:11] <shibboleth> you got me
[01:17:28] <Hunterkll> well, either way
[01:17:43] <Hunterkll> chipset key disclosure in kaby lake doesn't seem to be a blocker to Win11 requirements 
[01:18:15] <Hunterkll> so that can't be an argument for why the min reqs exist
[01:18:24] <Hunterkll> when the answer's been in front of everyone since 2018 
[01:18:27] <shibboleth> also also: iirc as of coffee exposure/enablement of ptt/ftpm was required
[01:18:46] <shibboleth> well, not ftpm, but for then-current amd
[01:18:49] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: not required at all?
[01:18:52] <Hunterkll> oh
[01:18:55] <Hunterkll> i dunno about AMD
[01:19:21] <shibboleth> Hunterkll, iirc coffee it had to be an option in the bios
[01:19:55] <shibboleth> sure, ptt has been there since haswell, but few consumer bios/mobo had the option to enable it
[01:19:56] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: nah, look at all the motherboard manufacturers that scrambled to release a bios update to add the PTT/fTPM functionality module to UEFI after Win11's announcement 
[01:19:57] <Hunterkll> lol
[01:20:19] <Hunterkll> even today, if you buy a new motherboard at microcenter, chances are you'll have to update the firmware to be able to enable it

[01:46:19] <Hunterkll> I refuse to fly southwest unless someone else is paying and I don't have a choice
[01:46:20] <Hunterkll> lol
[01:46:27] <shibboleth> i've had 2.4a usb-a though, so i macgyvered charging
[01:48:18] <shibboleth> again. not steerage, square peg, round hole. but *AC* (not dc) on planes... well, the onboard stuff certainly doesn't use ac
[01:48:40] <Hunterkll> yea, they generate it for the passenger sections
[01:48:54] <Hunterkll> but I had AC even on those tiny regional jets that have the undersized overhead bins 
[01:49:00] <Hunterkll> which annoy the fuck out of me but beyond that
[01:50:15] <Hunterkll> and we're talking CRJ 700's and Embraer 175's 
[01:50:24] <Hunterkll> i think american has all their boeings already refit too
[01:50:31] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> dc is easier to run
[01:50:40] <shibboleth> also, a lot less unsafe
[01:50:45] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> and its easier to current balance in event of a failure

[01:52:16] <Hunterkll> "
[01:52:27] <shibboleth> well... doesn't that kinda... you know, i don't wanna give anyone ideas as to how to... "persuade" flight staff
[01:52:40] <Hunterkll> i'm actually *surprised* when I get a flight without AC power 
[01:52:54] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> usally they need to run the ovens/microwaves
[01:52:55] <Hunterkll> makes me go "was this plane last refit 10 years ago?!?!"
[01:53:35] <Hunterkll> I think all the airbus ones now have AC outlets too now at this point
[01:54:03] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> anything that dosnt run on battery is AC generaly on a plane
[01:54:05] <Hunterkll> (this is for american airlines)
[01:54:19] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> but you dont need long distance transmission so DC is fine
[01:54:20] <shibboleth> also, may be that i haven't noticed. if we're talking flight times that extend beyond battery life i'mma be working hard on fighting jetlag

[02:06:29] <Hunterkll> in this case, it was the passenger's battery bank/pack
[02:06:31] <Hunterkll> not the laptop 
[02:06:40] <Hunterkll> but same response idea
[02:06:49] <Hunterkll> “Emergency personnel met the aircraft and customers remained onboard prior to the aircraft redeparting for Nassau,”
[02:07:34] <Hunterkll> the whole carry-on only thing for lithium ion batteries was a response due to all the incidents with them, apparently
[02:07:41] <Hunterkll> so that fire can actually be responded to

[02:45:27] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> didnt like the sound design much though
[02:45:41] <sd_> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> i loved it
[02:45:49] <sd_> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> thought it was fantastic
[02:46:13] <sd_> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> especially after watching it on my headphones and not having to deal with overdriven speakers at the theater
[02:47:36] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> honestly i am waiting for it on netflix
[02:47:56] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> also i hope they put in the stuff they left out in part 1
[02:48:08] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> thankfully everyone who HAD to die died the right way
[02:48:35] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> but honestly seeing jason mammoa as a mentat in movie 3-4 is gonna be quite an instresting casting
[02:48:43] <sd_> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> i never read the book, though after this movie i'm probably going to. I only got to like, ch. 3 or somethin
[02:48:51] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> read the back first

[02:49:21] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> i doubt it
[02:49:26] <CptLuxx> its amazing
[02:49:39] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> the sarduka anrt deployed the same way again
[02:49:56] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> they left out a few very important chairters from the books
[02:50:12] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> also gender bending lieit keyns made zero sence

[02:52:47] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> so the communitys/people that know prohibit female leadership out of self preserevation
[02:53:20] <sd_> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> they put out a really good little vid on why he made the movie the way he did and I appreciate the honestly
[02:53:20] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> so liet keyns would never be a leader of the fremen as a woman
[02:53:56] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> well i hope we get to book 5 and he dose it properly and we get to see the honored mattres
[02:54:09] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> yeah women take over
[02:55:52] <hirogen> guys whats the easiest way to find out how updates are deployed at work? 
[02:56:31] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> check the update event id
[02:58:23] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> Honestly the first book is the most boring
[02:58:23] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> But everything has to happen in a specific way for the rest of the 5000 years the books cover to play out correctly
[02:58:28] <JollyRgrs> hirogen: how do you mean? there's not many different ways and it is pretty easy to figure it out
[02:59:19] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> Like the birth of Paul's sister
[02:59:52] <JollyRgrs> SPOILER ALERT!
[03:00:04] <JollyRgrs> some of us haven't read the books so we won't get spoiled before the movie
[03:00:19] <hirogen> we got sccm here, lansweeper heard something about business updates being setup too, but honestly i dont know how they deploy patching if it's scheduled and actually work atm.. hearing that they've had issues updating phyical machines , i would ask systems guys but they're not good ppl, they're in for a shock as they've finally hired management for them
[03:00:52] <JollyRgrs> hirogen: i mean... what position are you currently at the company?
[03:01:22] <JollyRgrs> either you should have first-hand knowledge of what system is being used (if SCCM is installed, there's a very high chance it is SCCM)... or you don't and don't really have a "need to know" or you could simply ask the guy who handles it
[03:01:27] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> The biggest spoiler is considered non cannon anyway
[03:01:54] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> I look forward too see who works it out :)
[03:02:36] <hirogen> im a contractor in 2nd line, i tend to figure out stuff here though
[03:02:46] <hirogen> NHS but been here 6 months 
[03:02:49] <JollyRgrs> wtf does that mean?
[03:02:54] <JollyRgrs> "contractor in 2nd line"?
[03:02:58] <hirogen> like BAU support
[03:02:58] <JollyRgrs> you workin an assembly line?
[03:03:05] <hirogen> front line
[03:03:16] <Hunterkll> hirogen: i mean, does your system pop up a box that says "Will reboot in X hours" and "Your system administrator requires configuration changes to your computer" and shit?
[03:03:18] <hirogen> but i also do some basic scripting and use tools liek controlup, lansweeper
[03:03:19] <Hunterkll> if so, that's SCCM 
[03:03:20] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:03:22] <JollyRgrs> ok, so just ask whoever handles SCCM how they do updates if you wanna know
[03:03:45] <hirogen> dunno never seen it
[03:03:48] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> NHS have their own terms
[03:03:50] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:04:09] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> Check for sccm ports open else there is a reg key somewhere
[03:04:13] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: nah lets make him dig through a million log files 
[03:04:19] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> That lits the update method
[03:04:24] <JollyRgrs> look, no one cares if you made the Nat'l honor society, k?
[03:04:30] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess if they're using lansweeper to do updates, then the reg keys won't reflect that 
[03:04:38] <xe0n> morn
[03:04:41] <Hunterkll> they could still be pointing at the SCCM instance and configured as such
[03:04:42] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> Or pdq
[03:04:43] <JollyRgrs> check for SCCM ports? lol
[03:04:51] <Hunterkll> lansweeper pushes the binary to the machine and runs it locally 
[03:04:53] <Hunterkll> outside of the WU path
[03:05:02] <JollyRgrs> ports can be open, doesn't mean they are being used
[03:05:11] <sd_> 11<H​otmess> Pdq dose same thing
[03:05:14] <JollyRgrs> they could have lansweeper and SCCM, and yet just leave it to WUfB... or just WU in general
[03:05:17] <Hunterkll> and he already said they're using SCCM for other shit
[03:05:30] <Hunterkll> so the SCCM agent is already there and doing shit and talking to the SCCM mothership
[03:05:35] *** Quits: jesse (~jesse@user/jesse) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:05:52] <JollyRgrs> you could check SCCM software center to see if updates are coming in, or check the ccmcache folders to see if they contain patch binaries
[03:07:22] <JollyRgrs> but still, easiest way is just to ask the dang dude
[03:07:56] <xe0n> ^
[03:08:26] <JollyRgrs> this will also help if you want to move up in the company (become internal, move to sysadmin, etc.)

[14:06:44] <BWMerlin> Honestly, not good
[14:07:06] <BWMerlin> Started off on the back foot, I had most of the stuff installed that I needed to but missed one thing
[14:07:13] <BWMerlin> And then something else got missed
[14:07:21] <BWMerlin> So I spent at least an hour just trying to start
[14:07:52] <BWMerlin> So was always playing catchup and didn't feel I was able to learn as I had to just keep trying to find answers really quick to keep up
[14:08:20] <BWMerlin> Like when there was an issue I couldn't just read through the MS docs and understand how things were trying to work
[14:09:00] <BWMerlin> And it was only as we were leaving that some very key fundamental concepts actually clicked
[14:09:39] <xe0n> were you given a list of stuff to have prepared before you arrived?
[14:09:49] <BWMerlin> Was indeed
[14:10:21] <BWMerlin> Two things were missed, dot net and an extension
[14:11:23] <xe0n> do you continue tomorrow?
[14:11:57] <xe0n> no class notes provides\your own? can go over them in your own time
[14:12:05] <xe0n> plenty of coding stuff online to learn concepts etc
[14:12:21] <xe0n> you should look at the self paced video training stuff around, pluralsight, itprotv, etc etc
[14:12:34] <BWMerlin> Looks like the extension isn't mentioned in any of the install docs
[14:12:56] <BWMerlin> The class/course is going to be open sourced
[14:13:28] <xe0n> well there's plenty of coding training online, along with other stuff
[14:13:30] <BWMerlin> I think had I not been behind the ball I would of enjoyed/got more out of it
[14:13:48] <xe0n> look at getting access to some training sites and working through that
[14:13:52] <xe0n> i use pluralsight myself
[14:14:07] <BWMerlin> The guy who ran it works for pluralsight
[14:14:11] <xe0n> there ya go
[14:14:16] <xe0n> so you'll prob find his course online lol
[14:14:23] <xe0n> or similiar stuff

[21:40:14] <AnimalFarmPig> sorry, mention of brisket & eggs reminded me of breakfast tacos... mmmm....
[21:40:21] <fritzwastaken> I mean, when your hungry in Hungary
