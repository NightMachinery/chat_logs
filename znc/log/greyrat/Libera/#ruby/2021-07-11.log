[04:18:34] <nakilon> and maybe I need RRDTool, not Cacti
[04:18:43] <nakilon> I just need to see custom metrics
[04:19:36] <nakilon> and it appeared that I can't trivially add custom server data to Stackdriver, because it wants a "resource id" that has to be GCP or AWS
[04:20:02] <nakilon> and Stackdriver refuses to take data with older timestamp than was already pushed
[04:20:40] <nakilon> so I can't push from two servers to one timeline
[04:23:19] <nakilon> maybe I should just push it to some [no]sql and render on fly like this? https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/prog/rrdruby.en.html
[04:42:21] <nakilon> probably RRDB input timestamps also have to be in order

[20:18:23] <michigan> Hello, so normally I set my translations like `I18n.locale = :en` etc. But would something like this work `I18n.locale = :#{ something }`?
[20:19:48] <michigan> Or is it a "Ruby doesn't work like that" kinda thing? :-)
[20:19:55] <nakilon> adam12 I'll push the data to cloud nosql, then retrieve and pass via rrd ruby bindings
[20:20:44] <nakilon> I almost made it, the only thing left is to add the oauth to cloud run service, it's much less straight-forward than the rrd part
