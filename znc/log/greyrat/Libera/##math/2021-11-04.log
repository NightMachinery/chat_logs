[03:44:04] <dude12312414> and the induction step is that if it holds true for min(a, b) = m, it holds for min(a, b) = m + 1

[08:51:13] <cads> hey all, suppose I have two hypothetical speech signals from two smartphone microphones on my desk. Mathematically, is there a reason to expect that I can't expect to combine the two signals into a supermicrophone that appreciably lowers the noise floor of the two signals?

[08:57:33] <cads> does it help to think of the signals and noise in the frequency domain? I imagine the spectrum of the noise floor as some constant line f. I am not sure if I should think of the spectrum as a constant line, or a choppy and random distributional fuzz that touches f almost everywhere from beneath.
[08:59:32] <cads> the proof idea I have is that any signal that falls underneath this floor is simply drowned somehow, becoming unrecoverable for some reason
[09:02:09] <cads> But I believe I am missing a few key ideas about how we mathematically model the situation

[09:53:18] <droid3> I know algebraic varieties vs manifolds which one is more general? My thoughts is algebraic varieties are more general if you go with abstract rings or fields other then R and C.
[09:54:03] <droid3> However manifold are more general interms of function not being polynomials necessarily (aka smooth holomorphic function...etc)
[09:55:18] <droid3> So if one drops the requirement that an variety be algebraic and more generally cover any transcendental equation  as well over arbitrary fields
[09:55:37] <droid3> Would it then be more general the what you can make a manifold be.
[09:56:13] <droid3> So the question/talk is between algebraic geometries tool aka the variety and the differential geometry tool the manifold
[09:56:32] <droid3> which one is more general or can be made more general to incorporate the other one.
[09:57:02] <droid3> Or could one get so general as to make both variety == to manifolds in generality
[09:57:39] <droid3> there is many different types of manifolds from differential , riemman , complex ,...list goes on.
[09:58:16] <droid3> But usually we just consider varieties to be the algebraic type for polynomial set of points over rings/fields.
[09:59:21] <droid3> Just curious if varieties in the most general sense and manifolds in the most general sense are equivalent
[09:59:38] <droid3> in that whatever you do in one can be solved in the other.
[10:01:34] <droid3> I suppose varieties as general as you can define them are just tuples of points so in this sense has to be as general as any manifold definition
[10:02:38] <droid3> i guess its like comparing apples and oranges at times so its just brainstorming tonight not truely correct reasoning

[10:05:53] <droid3> Another word can system of polynomial equation solution graph be expressed as a  manifold
[10:06:39] <droid3> It seems true by trivial maps for the manifold
[10:07:24] <droid3> But going the other way not all manifolds can be realized as the solution of a system of polynomial equations / aka an algebraic variety in this sense.
[10:08:40] <droid3> Because all this talk is more about if there was a one to one corresponds between solving something with varieties or with manifolds
[10:09:19] <droid3> then if one proves something working with manifolds it would hold for that case of varieties as well.
[10:09:24] <droid3> and visa-versa
[10:10:15] <droid3> Like a cool way to switch to using manifolds if its easier to solve a problem using those or switch to varieties if its easier to solve a problem with those.
[10:10:44] <droid3> Some sort of bridge between algebraic geometry and differential geometry
[10:12:57] <droid3> so one could translate a problem from one subject area into the other. Or beable to form an equivalent problem in both subjects. So he could solve the problem using which ever is easier in that particular case.

Varieties are (in most books) assumed to be over algebraically closed fields, so extending to rings you enter the world of schemes and this is a different story. Comparing varieties over the complex number and manifolds, of course manifolds are (much) more general, since polynomials are but a small class of holomorphic functions

[14:58:51] <Franciman> there was a time in which elementary school mathematics was abstract
[14:58:56] <Franciman> they understood that it was useless

[14:59:30] <Franciman> that's why we got back to less abstraction
[14:59:44] <Franciman> now people change, maybe nowadays kids are smarter
[15:00:04] <Franciman> but I doubt you get much results on average
[15:00:22] <Franciman> ofc if there is one genious in your classroom, they will benefit
[15:00:32] <Inst> Franciman: i guess it's a difference in cultural attitude
[15:00:43] <Franciman> but they will not need school to be a genious and pursue their interests
[15:00:52] <Franciman> Inst: I said we tried the abstraction early on
[15:00:55] <Inst> if you read up shanghai maths, their program is more oriented around whole class teaching in mathematics

[15:03:04] <Inst> ah

[15:04:49] <Franciman> so you may be right
[15:05:11] <Franciman> but the thing is that we tried in the past
[15:06:30] <Inst> is had something called "new math"
[15:06:36] <Inst> where kids were introduced to set theory in elementary school
[15:06:43] <Franciman> possibly! yeah
[15:06:47] <Franciman> i don't remember the name
[15:06:54] <Franciman> they had geometry books without pictures
[15:07:06] <Franciman> and abstraction was presented early on
[15:07:19] <Franciman> they wanted to start with formalism early on
[15:08:03] <Franciman> Frattini was a much better pedagogist for mathematics
[15:08:23] <Franciman> he insisted that abstraction is like salt, put it too much in your dish and it sucks
[15:08:31] <Franciman> put it too little, and it sucks

[18:31:28] <greenbagels> you want to clear the denominator altogether
[18:31:43] <lavaball> then i did it all, and ended up with 1- = (x-2x^3/x^8-3x^6-4x^5-x^4+x^2) which isn't really 2, i think.
[18:32:02] <lavaball> i'm guessing a white out isn't the way to do that.
[18:32:52] <greenbagels> you do roughly what the link i sent mentions, but its a little more tricky
[18:32:57] <lavaball> anyway, thanks for the link. i'll look through it.
[18:33:11] <greenbagels> because you're going to take the least common multiple of polynomials, not of integers

You can solve that for x easily, and we have not trampled on extraneous solutions because we need all of x, x + 1, x - 1  to be nonzero for the original equation to make sense at all.

[18:45:27] <Z-module> Guest59: your integral works out to be "easily" divergent. But yeah, you need to split it into two pieces first.
[18:46:08] <Guest59> for sequences to converge, I need to take their limit and see if i get a number or not. for the sequence " a_n = (-1)^n sqrt(n) ", how do I take that limit?
[18:46:12] <Guest59> it is always alternating
[18:46:38] <greenbagels> (-1)^n 1/n has a limit, but alternates
[18:46:53] <Guest59> how do you do that limit?
[18:47:16] <greenbagels> you gotta think about limits in terms of what they actually mean rather than just techniques to calculate them
[18:47:22] <Z-module> Guest59, your sequence is unbounded (check that). Thus it can't possibly converge to any finite limit.
[18:47:39] <Guest59> dont i check that by taking the limit
[18:47:48] <Z-module> all convergent sequences are bounded, at the very least
[18:48:10] <Guest59> is the limit of that just 0, greenbagles
[18:48:16] <greenbagels> of what i wrote, yes
[18:48:20] <Z-module> (as long as we don't count "goes to +infty" and "goes to -infty" as "convergent")
[18:48:22] <Guest59> yeah
[18:49:36] <greenbagels> Guest59: think about what sequential limits mean

[18:50:18] <Z-module> There are plenty of covergent sequences whose limits we can't precisely express
[18:50:24] <greenbagels> it means if i want to get within any given distance i want of a supposed limit, i know an N where all terms after that Nth term are under that distance
[18:50:53] <Guest59> ok
[18:51:13] <greenbagels> so if a limit doesn't exist, it means you can always violate that requirement
[18:51:49] <greenbagels> you can always find a larger n > N where |f(n)-L| > epsilon, your desired distance to the limit
[18:52:12] <greenbagels> like Z-module said, unbounded functions always break that requirement

[18:56:32] <lericson> if p is a probability then the odds of p is defined as f(p) = p/(1-p), can you invert f(p)?
[18:57:11] <Guest59> also, if I am given a set of numbers {1,0,-1, 1,0,-1,...} this is also a sequence, but not written like i've seen with a_n = something. How do we tell if this is convergent or divergent ?
[18:57:53] <Z-module> The gaps between successive terms in any convergent sequence must get arbitrarily small. IN this, they don't.
[18:58:22] <Guest59> oh right..thats the whole definition isn't it
[18:58:31] <greenbagels> lericson: try my favorite high school method: swap your dependent and independent variables and solve :D
[18:58:35] <lericson> f^-1(o) = p(1+f(p))
[18:58:43] <lericson> greenbagels: it's late ok :p
[18:59:02] <greenbagels> i didnt mean it to be demeaning :D
[18:59:03] <Guest59> Z-module okay. Now what about the recursion formula thing?
[18:59:12] <greenbagels> more like a "this could have pitfalls i'm not aware of, i havent thought of it much since high school"
[18:59:39] <Z-module> Guest59: it's not an iff condition. For example, the gaps between successive terms of  a_n = 1/1 +...+ 1/n   do get smaller and smaller, and -> 0 in the limit, but that sequence does not converge.
[18:59:45] <lericson> i think it's just f(p)/(1+f(p))
[19:00:07] <lericson> yep
[19:00:17] <lericson> makes sense also
[19:00:24] <Guest59> ok
[19:00:29] <greenbagels> yeah mathematica agrees lericson
[19:00:35] <greenbagels> f(p)/(1+f(p))
[19:01:07] <Z-module> Guest59: You might like to ponder this simple generalization:  Any convergent sequence of integers must be eventually constant.
[19:01:20] <lericson> what i really want to know is, say i have probabilities p1, p2, p3, their joint is p1·p2·p3 assuming independence, their log joint is log p1 + log p2 + log p3. is the same true if we express them as odds o1, o2, o3?
[19:01:28] <Guest59> Z-module no thank you
[19:01:40] <lericson> i'll see what shakes out with the inverse function

[20:15:41] <Guest59> that was neat trick
[20:16:32] <brownorange> My best idea at the moment is because the set of natural numbers is infinite but no natural number itself is infinite, that's why math is incomplete. And math can't prove its own consistency without being complete, and if it could prove its own consistency that would be inconsistent with the facts about natural numbers

[20:17:48] <cherim> But even a probabilist would agree that anything by Peres should be worth
[20:17:55] <brownorange> if the formal language of math is encodeable into natural numbers, then we know because there is no infinite natural number but there is infinitely many natural numbers, that there will be unaccounted for formulas

[22:23:16] <dila> int-e: i was really only interested in the finite and infinite cases. that's all :)
[22:23:38] <int-e> Even that Z/2Z could be a subring of (Z/2Z)^2.
[22:24:06] <dila> yes i suppose i meant a field (with a generator)
[22:24:23] <int-e> In which case you'd have 2 more elements to discover... and you wouldn't get them through ring operations from the elements you know.

[23:42:45] <biberao> i know the one lim x->0 ln(1+x)/x=1
[23:42:47] <acegallagher> I have an odd question about pearsson's correlation coeffs. how would one quantify proportional contribution of a time series to a correlatoin. so, to give an explicit example, I'm correlating environmental temperatures with a range of related variables... and for some of them, I think the 'higher' correlation comes from a portion of he regime. i.e. low temperatures are highly correlated... but high
[23:42:53] <acegallagher> temperatures are not.
[23:43:05] <biberao> didnt know the inverse still works int-e
[23:43:13] <acegallagher> is the obvious solution, subsetting the time series based on a temperature threshold, the most correct way to look at it?
[23:44:45] <Pi-sistance> ok I dont understand how to do this loci problem even reading some workings out. show that the locus of the argument of (z-1)/(z-j)=pi/6 is a circle.. I made the same calculations as them didnt know how to proceed and in their workings they completely discard the denominator in 1 step
[23:45:40] <Z-module> Pi-sistance: your j is the complex unit, j^2 = -1 ?  (AKA the engineer's 'i' )
[23:46:39] <qergle> if j=i, i doubt this is a circle
[23:47:21] <Pi-sistance> as usual I used tangent and put the j terms on the numerator and real terms in the denominator. but its already a damn fraction extrmemly confusing. ill post the problematic step.
[23:47:36] <Pi-sistance> yes j=i. i sometimes forget to switch back to i in this room

[23:49:33] <Z-module> Pi-sistance: so that means   arg(z - 1) - arg(z - i) = pi/6 , right?
[23:49:54] <Pi-sistance> using the usual conjugate rule we end up with arg((x^2 +y^2 -x-y +i(x+y-1)/(x^2+y^2-2y+1)) =pi/6
