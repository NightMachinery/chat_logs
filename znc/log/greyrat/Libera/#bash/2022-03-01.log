[00:13:15] <mattf> using getopts is there a way to detect when an argument require values but it was used without passing a value?
[00:13:55] <mattf> because if i put a : after it it will only be matched when a value is passed, and if i dont ${OPTARG} is always empty

[01:53:15] <k8yun> I would like the VAR to e available without me logging into the bash
[01:53:43] <emanuele6> !environment
[01:53:43] <greybot> Each process has its own private variable space called the "environment". A child inherits a *copy* of the parent's. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Environment
[01:54:22] <emanuele6> what you say doesn't make much sense.
[01:54:57] <tirnanog> some display managers respect .profile but pam_env(8) is probably going to be the simplest way, if you have pam.
[01:57:00] <tirnanog> I say that because I interpret your last comment as meaning that you want it set in your operating environment without having to open a terminal emulator or run a shell in any capacity.
[01:58:08] <k8yun> pam_env... okay, I will look into that. I was going to stick that in in the `/etc/environment`
[01:58:32] <tirnanog> indeed, /etc/environment is read by pam_env.
[01:58:49] <tirnanog> not that it's a bash affair at this point, but you can read the pam_env man page for more details.
[01:59:15] <k8yun> pam is pretty new to me... but sounds like /etc/environment should solve it; I will later spend some more time on PAM
[01:59:17] <k8yun> thanks all

[06:19:54] <pj> Lebela: we don't charge for help, and tbh I would not accept help from anyone who demanded money on IRC for it.
[06:20:22] <pj> but ... your question appears to be off-topic for #bash, so you will likely need to find help in a more appropriate channel.

[06:21:40] <Lebela> I currently mount my external LUKS encrypted devices by using  "tail -f /var/log/syslog"  and seeing what new device comes in.
[06:22:01] <Lebela> then:   sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdc1 foo
[06:22:22] <Lebela> and then:  sudo mount /dev/mapper/foo   /mnt/foo

[06:22:43] <Lebela> but it's a lot of manual work.   (especially the tail -f /var/log/syslog  part)
[06:23:03] <Lebela> So, I was thinking about programming a bash script,  that gets run by a crontab job every X seconds, checking for new devices

[06:30:33] <Lebela_> otherwise, I must find some other solution
[06:30:43] <pj> well anyone here can help you with the bash scripting side, we don't have to be luks experts to do that.

[15:51:17] <shbot> emanuele6: var[b]: <hello>
[15:51:25] <jjakob> right now I have a function that defines n1_var_a, n1_var_b, ..., n2_var_a, n2_var_b,... and so on for n{1..4} and var_{a-d}, for example
[15:51:45] <emanuele6> # declare -A var=([a]=hi [b]=hello); x=b   printf 'var[%s]: <%s>\n' "$x" "${var[$x]}"

[15:54:18] <emanuele6> no!
[15:54:32] <emanuele6> n1_var_a gives you no protection against collision of name e.g. n(1_var)_var_(a) vs n(1)_var_(var_a)
[15:54:55] <emanuele6> so what prevents you from doing ${var[n1_a]} or something like that?

[15:55:25] <jjakob> right, but the n is always generated by the script via index variables in for loops so it's never not correct
[15:55:27] <emanuele6> you clearly have no expectation of collision safety with your variable name in variable design
[15:55:35] <emanuele6> also why would you need something like this?
[15:55:39] <jjakob> and the variable names are all predefined inthe script

[15:56:07] <emanuele6> exactly!
[15:56:25] <emanuele6> so why do you think you can't just concatenate the keys in the associative array? i don't get it
[15:56:35] <jjakob> why would I need collision safety if I never feed external input that may ne incorrect form
[15:56:44] <emanuele6> that is what i am saying.
[15:57:02] <emanuele6> i also don't even get why you need something like this at all, but that is unrelated.
[15:57:42] <emanuele6> you have asked for a "2 level associative array" and brought up that you need to keys, but that clearly makes no difference.
[15:58:22] <jjakob> you said "${var[n1_a]}" which would work for my use case too
[15:58:28] <emanuele6> why can't you just use ${arr[${k1}_${k2}]} or whatever?
[15:59:34] <jjakob> I could, I didn't think of it :)

[16:10:23] <emanuele6> i don't even get why they need something like that
[16:11:51] <jjakob> I'm writing a backup script that takes a list of mountpoints, gathers information about the filesystems, device types, etc., determines the optimal snapshot size for each, then shapshots and mounts them in order
[16:12:07] <emanuele6> that doesn't explain why you need that

[16:13:26] <furrymcgee> recutils offers a textbased database with bash plugin
[16:13:48] <jjakob> because if I have e.g. 4 mountpoints from 2 different LVM VGs, each with a different free extent number, and I want to make snapshots of correct sizes, I need to first gather all the VG names of each mountpoint, get the free extents for each VG, then use that in the calculation later when mounting

[16:17:59] <jjakob> yeah for example doing "50%FREE" would give you 50, 25, 12.5,..., without this you either give it a fixed size that may be too small or too large

[18:13:28] <Earnestly> ForeverNoob[m]: They're ECMA48 standard SGR sequences, so very portable

[18:15:18] <emanuele6> Earnestly: i think asa(1) is supposed to remove the first character from each line and perform an action based on it
[18:15:33] <emanuele6> it doesn't just remove CR
[18:16:04] <emanuele6> if you want to use it like that, you have to prepend a space to each line
[18:16:34] <Earnestly> Yes, this should be easy to implement in awk
[18:16:45] <Earnestly> Well, an awk with null split
[18:16:56] <Earnestly> Hm, no substr will work to get the first character
[18:17:11] <Earnestly> Then based on that, be it a space, +, 0, or 1, do whatever the manual says

[21:10:11] <Guest9893> tirnanog so not good idea to use that way?
[21:10:25] <jjakob> that's a bad idea as it relies on you being cd'd into the right directory to not nuke your whole filesystem
[21:11:27] <Guest9893> im in /mnt/example for example. and the user wich have access to this folder, cant cd into other dirs, and cat ls other dirs, and cant use /mnt/example, he can only use *
[21:11:36] <tirnanog> Guest9893: the gnu find method basically avoids two things. one is that, normally, globs don't match names beginning with a dot as you've already learned. the second concerns (potentially) exceeding ARG_MAX, which might happen in the case that a glob matches a very large qunatity of pathnames.
[21:11:36] <Guest9893> to manipulate things in that folder

[21:14:07] <Guest9893> i only want to delete everything in a folder, without to delete the folder self, and to delete truly everything, and if there are 39403827543095743057349594305703 dotfiles including millions of other "normal" files, everything should be deleted. so if i understand you right, i have to set ARG_MAX too ?

[21:15:53] <jjakob> if there really is that many files in there, rm will refuse to delete them anyway, as you'll exceed its maximum number of parameters. it happens very often, happened to me today when deleting a load of backups, when there were thousands of files
[21:16:20] <jjakob> if you really have that many files in there, find is your only choice, as it'll break them into smaller chunks

[21:17:14] <tirnanog> find -delete does not break into chunks. it simply unlinks for every pathname traversed. again, gnu only.
[21:17:15] <Guest9893> or rsync --delete $a_true_empty_folder $destination should work too?

[22:22:04] <Earnestly> How do you put yourself in a situation where this is a thing?
[22:22:17] <Earnestly> Why would you need to 'break' out of a case statement?
[22:22:33] <Earnestly> Like trying to break out of an if statement, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me
[22:22:55] <twkm> they likely want to avoid a long if.

[22:24:26] <jjakob> the same reason you'd want to use jump statements anywhere

[22:25:12] <Earnestly> jjakob: I've never wanted to do that lol
[22:25:43] <lechner> having spawned your brief off-topic, i'll throw in that debian polarizes because, as a distribution, it sometimes must pick sides. it leaves a lot of unhappy other halves. my apologies, i won't say more
[22:25:58] <jjakob> you can break out of a loop, why not a case
[22:26:14] <Earnestly> I learned proceedural programming and so end up trying to represent things in a certain way which precludes things like continue, break, goto, etc.  Not entirely, they have their uses, but not often
[22:26:28] <Earnestly> Although only ever use break

[22:28:38] <twkm> some people like goto, so not having it in bash can be aggravating for them.

[22:29:42] <emanuele6> Earnestly: you can break out a switch statement in C
[22:30:00] <emanuele6> because a switch statement is a jump table
[22:30:00] <twkm> doesn't want to have to run or indent the remaining code.
[22:30:01] <Earnestly> emanuele6: C has implicit fallthough

[22:30:24] <twkm> bash does too, though explicit.

[22:30:31] <emanuele6> ;&
[22:30:36] <jjakob> twkm: it's more like " 42) sometimeserrors; if error; break; fi; otherstuff ;;"
[22:30:52] <Earnestly> What are you breaking out of though?
[22:31:05] <Earnestly> If your case $foo is 42, and hits that branch, then it... just ends?
[22:31:06] <twkm> if ! sometimeserrors; then otherstuff; fi;;
[22:31:14] <Earnestly> Oh
[22:31:18] <Earnestly> lol
[22:31:22] <jjakob> it's an example, if break could be used to break out of a case, like it can be used in c switch
[22:31:48] <emanuele6> case is not really like a switch statement
[22:31:48] <Earnestly> That's beyond words
[22:31:49] <twkm> it can't, so stop hoping.  accept that you need an if (or so).
[22:31:52] <olspookishmagus> I got more than once that shuf isn't to be trusted on "true randomness" so I replaced it in all of my scripts with "shuf -R". care to comment?
[22:32:10] <emanuele6> case checks if a string matches one or more fnmatch pattern
[22:32:22] <jjakob> I knew a long time ago it can't, I'm just responding to whatever you ask me after that :)
[22:32:46] <twkm> not me.
[22:32:55] <Earnestly> I'd love to see a good example for such a need that isn't just bad use of control flow
[22:33:07] <twkm> i've pointed out the alternative you have to accept.
