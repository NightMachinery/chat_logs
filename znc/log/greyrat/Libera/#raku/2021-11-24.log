[04:07:26] <tbrowder> i‚Äôm looking at creating a raku module from perl/c components licensed under lgplv3. anything i should watch out for. essentially all i‚Äôm doing is converting the algorithms to raku.
[04:08:57] <tbrowder> i‚Äôve never had to worry about lgpl3 and am not a lawyer.
[04:11:07] <[Coke]> Are you doing this for a company? Do you expect to be able to make money on it, keep the source private?
[04:11:24] <[Coke]> if any of those questions are yes then you might want to consult someone.
[04:11:52] <[Coke]> </not legal advice>
[04:13:18] <[Coke]> (we always have to consult legal for anything, but gpl basically gets rejected and lgpl gets a very serious examination)
[04:20:31] <qorg11> how to use unix sockets in raku?

[04:53:27] <moon-child> tbrowder: you may want to look into clean-room reverse engineering.  Will require somebody else to help you
[05:06:59] <tbrowder> it‚Äôs for a public module
[05:09:05] <tbrowder> so just keeping same license should work i assume. my only concern was the conversion and some of the legal lingo about mods and such.

[08:32:12] <Xliff> Is there a way to tell if a CArray was allocated by Raku?
[08:32:43] <Xliff> If not, what would be the best way to add such a feature?
[08:32:55] <moon-child> could make your own table of them
[08:35:35] <Xliff> moon-child: No, you can't.
[08:35:39] <Xliff> It would not be sufficient.
[08:35:50] <Xliff> I don't want to call .elems on a C-allocated CArray. That will crash the script.
[08:36:26] <Xliff> And I don't want to deal with a table as said table might be out of scope when you need it.
[08:36:44] <Xliff> Unless said table is kept as a class value within the CArray type, itself.
[08:37:04] <Xliff> *sigh* -- the logic I need is in nqp.

[14:12:11] <jjatria> I've been playing around with AI::FANN, which seems to be very unmaintained, and I've made a bunch of changes to it. Now I'm wondering if there's a Raku equivalent to adopting a dist, specially since this is apparently a community module ü§î 
[14:13:21] <jjatria> I mean, I _could_ just release with a new auth. But I'd rather fix the dist we have
[14:25:56] <El_Che> jjatria: you are welcomed to adopt a community module as fair as I know
[14:31:20] <lizmat> jjatria: yes, if you want to take over maint of it yes
[14:31:32] <jjatria> Sweet :D 
[14:31:34] <El_Che> *far
[14:31:42] <jjatria> How does that work then?
[14:31:52] <lizmat> I could move the repo to your github ID so you have the whole history
[14:31:55] <El_Che> over to lizmat 
[14:32:00] <jjatria> El_Che++
[14:32:19] <jjatria> I guess we're not there yet with zef having org support
[14:33:17] <jjatria> But in the end, the net effect will still be a release with a different auth, I guess
[14:34:30] <lizmat> IMO that's fine
[14:34:56] <lizmat> as in Raku you can decide which auth of a module you would like to have
[14:35:07] <lizmat> and if you don't, you definitely don't care  :-)
[14:36:21] <El_Che> if you transfer it, github will redirect the old url, which is nice
[14:36:47] <lizmat> indeed... the same goes for renames of repos, btw
[14:37:09] <lizmat> so if you want to change all of your p6- repos to raku- repos, that's fine
[14:39:15] <jjatria> Ok, let's do that then. I already have a fork on my namespace. Would me deleting allow the move on your side, lizmat?
[14:39:41] <lizmat> yes, it would
[14:40:04] <jjatria> Ok, let me do that then üèÉ 
[14:41:05] <lizmat> what's your github ID ?
[14:41:23] <jjatria> jjatria, I'm boring like that :)
[14:41:35] <jjatria> Poof, gone. Ready when you are
[14:42:03] <lizmat> hhhmmm You can only transfer a repository from an organization to yourself at this time
[14:42:15] <lizmat> I guess it will be a two-step process then
[14:42:33] <jjatria> Thanks for taking the time!
[14:42:38] <lizmat> or I could give you the right access
[14:43:12] <lizmat> jjatria: should have an invite now
[14:43:23] <lizmat> should have rights to move it to yourself now
[14:43:47] <jjatria> Interesting. Ok, let me try
[14:45:11] <jjatria> That worked :D Thanks a lot!
[14:45:15] <jjatria> lizmat++
[14:46:05] <lizmat> ok, good luck!
[14:46:57] <lizmat> and thanks for the adoption!
[14:50:31] <El_Che> jjatria: I would have expected üêßjjatria!
[14:53:11] <jjatria> I'll have to open a ticket so Gthub allows emoji in usernames :P

[21:58:31] <tbrowder> lizmat: i just wonder if it‚Äôs ok to publish a module in our normal places if it‚Äôs NOT under an Artistic license.
[21:59:04] <lizmat> as long as it is under *an* open source license, I don't see any issue with that

[22:00:10] <tbrowder> ok, it‚Äôs clearly LGPL v3, so that should qualify i think
[22:00:28] <lizmat> https://raku.land/cpan:TYIL/Config::Parser::toml  does not have the Artistic license, e.g.

[22:06:22] <El_Che> I don't think Raku impose a license, but foss is certainly appreciated
[22:08:54] <ugexe> licensing should be handled through policy, but i'm not sure ecosystems are really the place to enforce such policy.
[22:09:29] <El_Che> you could do that in a distribution like star, by example
[22:09:55] <lizmat> foo   # just checking something :-)
[22:12:06] <El_Che> jjatria: maybe it could be useful for some people to look for modules depending on the license

[22:49:42] <avuserow> hey folks, I'm having intermittent installation failures with zef where it tells me that it doesn't understand a `git://` URL. Sometimes it works fine though. Here's a gist of a failure: https://gist.github.com/avuserow/5abddce31afcdaa99be3c17d7054fa8d - any pointers on how to narrow this down?
[22:50:06] <avuserow> it's running in a debian-based docker image, and it has wget, curl, tar, and git. not sure what else might be missing that zef would want.
[23:25:58] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/7d6b48db23eaca06c332fa6d0ca8ecae80ae83d4/lib/Zef/Service/Shell/git.rakumod#L104-L109
[23:26:04] <ugexe> thats what fires that check
[23:27:20] <ugexe> and yeah some heisenbug seemingly in rakudo causes this (either failing to spawn the process for some reason, or an issue with string handling)
[23:30:22] <ugexe> https://github.com/ugexe/zef/issues/352 is an old issue with similar behavior
