[00:35:24] <kalven> yep
[00:35:32] <PJBoy> std::distance isn't a problem
[00:35:38] <PJBoy> because you know it's slow

[00:36:08] <ville> PJBoy: why would anyone know it has slow mode?
[00:36:15] <PJBoy> it's slow by default
[00:36:16] <bpalmer> So why not apply that same philosophy to anything that uses lower_bound ? Assume it's slow, be happy when it's not
[00:36:23] <PJBoy> because you would never use std::distance on random access iterators

[00:37:14] <PJBoy> if you wanted to demand speed you'd use subtraction
[00:37:30] <PJBoy> std::lower_bound is a much more deceptive trap

[00:38:44] <PJBoy> std::distance isn't an algorithm
[00:39:10] <PJBoy> it's a hack to get around non random access iterator lack of subtraction

[00:44:18] * Alipha wonders if you could write a O(n log n) sort that doesn't involve copying back and forth from another container and uses only iterator operations (e.g., no std::list::splice like in https://github.com/alipha/cpp/blob/master/list_sort/list_sort.hpp )

[01:04:16] <PJBoy> and use --std=c++17 in your g++ command

[01:09:40] <PJBoy> fiesh, I think kalven put it best
[01:09:54] <Alipha> fiesh: one expects std::lower_bound to be O(log n). it's a surprise when it's O(n)
[01:09:54] <PJBoy> both in stating the problem and solution
[01:10:06] <Ox151> Alipha: yes, PJBoy suggested just changing to inline, but what if I did not use inline?
[01:10:46] <Alipha> Ox151: you're issue is that you should have `Cube* Cube::instance;` inside the cpp, not `Cube Cube::*instance;`. Those are two different things
[01:11:29] <fiesh> Alipha: it *is* O(log n) in terms of applications of the predicate -- simply the iterator increment takes O(n) when it must... anything else would be quite startling to me
[01:12:01] <Alipha> fiesh: how about std::lower_bound not compiling if you're not providing random-access iterators?
[01:12:02] <PJBoy> yeah and reverse_iterator could support forward iterators if it just did O(n) time increment operations
[01:12:10] <PJBoy> but no one wants that
[01:12:17] <Alipha> Ox151: the latter declares instance as a global "pointer to data member" variable, not a "member variable named instance of type Cube*"
[01:12:46] <Alipha> Ox151: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pointer#Pointers_to_members
[01:13:10] <fiesh> PJBoy: can't find anything about lower_bound by kalven, but it might be that I'd have to read the context, or it's farther back
[01:13:42] <PJBoy> [21:03]	kalven	I don't like apis with performance traps
[01:13:43] <PJBoy> [21:04]	kalven	there could have been two different names
[01:14:08] <fiesh> ah thanks
[01:15:06] <fiesh> Alipha: that would be meaningful if the function provided no benefit over a naive linear iteration -- but since it does, it would be a loss.  giving it two names as kalven suggested would be ok I suppose but have to navigated around in generic code
[01:15:15] <Alipha> Ox151: also, your destructor `Cube::~Cube(){ delete(Cube::instance); }` will never get called. and if it does get called, it'll be a recursive loop (`delete` will call the destructor which will call `delete` which will call the destructor, etc)
[01:15:59] <Alipha> Ox151: really, just use Scott Meyer's Singleton instead: http://laristra.github.io/flecsi/src/developer-guide/patterns/meyers_singleton.html

[07:45:04] <Alipha> lockywolf: that's a super weird constructor definition. You can only pass nullptr to the constructor (or pass nothing, and it is the same as passing nullptr).... Can you provide more context, so I can perhaps understand why this constructor exists?

[07:47:35] <lockywolf> well, the context is the program I want to use doesn't build on mingw64
[07:48:07] <lockywolf> and that constructor is autogenerated by something called cpprt or something like that
