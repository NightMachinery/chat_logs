[03:16:23] <Zgredu[m]> I was planning to go through the CLRS book and learn an interesting language along the way. Is Raku a good choice for learning algorithms?
[03:28:52] <guifa> Zgredu[m] Raku is nice because it lends itself to the various programming paradigms.  I've not used that book, but looking at the topics in the book, I think it should be rather nice for them.  It really just depends on how close to the metal the book gets
[03:30:01] <guifa> Ah I just found some samples of it online.  
[03:30:42] <guifa> Yeah, that psuedo code will translate rather nicely in Raku

[03:40:25] <Zgredu[m]> That's great to hear. I tried Racket and Scheme for a while but the way they handled arrays was a bit too strange. Go was OK but a bit too opinionated and poor in some aspects. Ada was almost ideal if not for the fact that all implementations are not garbage collected and Oberon-2 has no compilers at all. Raku just seemed like a nice language when I went through the examples on Rosetta Code and compared it with others
[03:40:31] <Zgredu[m]> Should I start with https://raku.guide/ or somewhere else?

[03:44:59] <guifa> Raku is also nice in that if something isn't working how you like, it's fairly easy to craft something that does and use it
[03:45:53] <guifa> raku.guide is nice.  also I think Laurent Rosenfeld has a book that dives into algorithms and such
[03:46:35] <Zgredu[m]> "Think Perl 6: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist"?
[03:47:30] <guifa> Yeah.  ALthough actually I just glanced through it, it's no where near as deep dive as CLRS — Rosenfeld calls it a book for beginners so it teaches a lot more fundamental concepts that you probably already understand fairly well
[03:47:48] <guifa> like the next to the last chapter goes over quick sort :-)
