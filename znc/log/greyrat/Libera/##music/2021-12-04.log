[00:00:13] <artao> CREEPIEST FUCKING THING EVER
[00:00:24] <artao> possesses people. makes them do bad bad bad things
[00:00:36] <artao> the actor playing him? wow
[00:01:01] <artao> he was just a set worker, and was accidentally in the shot and tried to duck out of the way so he'd not be seen
[00:01:16] <artao> but he WAS seen, and Lynch FUCKING LOVED IT cuz it looked so fucking creepy

[00:12:57] <artao> GREAT movie
[00:12:57] <morf> yeah
[00:13:08] <morf> and wants to put drugs on his anus
[00:13:15] <artao> based on a tale Rudyard Kipling told to King George V

[00:13:45] <artao> wow
[00:13:49] <louipc> sublim20: you can die
[00:13:57] <sublim20> pffffff
[00:14:01] <artao> depends on the drugs morf
[00:14:01] <sublim20> a small price to pay
[00:14:05] <murthy> Good night everyone
[00:14:12] <artao> a bit of medicated hemmorhoid relief cream?
[00:14:15] <artao> GREAT on the anus
[00:14:25] <artao> and you pretty much don't really wanna put it anywhere else
[00:14:26] <louipc> dang didnt know death was a small price
[00:14:46] <louipc> why's everyone so crying about it all the time
[00:14:59] <sublim20> cause they didn't die from a butt chugging
[00:15:04] <artao> i stole a VHS tape of Naked Lunch from Blockbuster Video because I felt they didn't deserve to have it on their shelves
[00:15:05] <artao> lol
[00:15:14] <louipc> oh
[00:15:16] <sublim20> how many people have you seen crying about someone dying from butt chug
[00:15:23] <artao> and i still have that tape
[00:15:31] <louipc> maybe 3
[00:15:36] <sublim20> cool
[00:15:40] <artao> i suspect that before long my VHS collection might actually be worth some nice money
[00:15:50] <artao> don't chug from butts
[00:16:08] <artao> also, don't go directly from anal back to vag or mouth
[00:16:12] <artao> that's just gross
[00:16:20] <artao> and entirely unsanitary

[00:16:36] <louipc> it could build immunity tho
[00:17:03] <artao> ATV is at least quickly remediable. a good wash after. and a good enema prior
[00:17:26] <artao> what builds immunity is eating out of dumpsters
[00:17:27] <louipc> you should make a blog about all these techniques
[00:17:37] <artao> louipc could i make bank?
[00:17:50] <louipc> then post the link on all the irc channels

[08:19:29] <morf> but as i read it's really important in the whole franko reich shit
[08:19:50] <Panther> Well
[08:19:52] <morf> Aachen developed from a Roman settlement and spa, subsequently becoming the preferred medieval Imperial residence of Emperor Charlemagne of the Frankish Empire, and, from 936 to 1531, the place where 31 Holy Roman Emperors were crowned Kings of the Germans.
[08:19:56] <morf> well
[08:20:07] <Panther> It's because he divided his kingdom, and his heirs fought over the split.

[08:20:14] <morf> fun fact
[08:20:30] <morf> i know all this random garbage about random things
[08:20:33] <morf> compeltely fucking useless
[08:20:48] <morf> here goes pepin the short
[08:20:55] <Panther> It is a Cáchy name.
[08:20:57] <Panther> :)
[08:21:06] <morf> After Roman times, Pepin the Short had a castle residence built in the town, due to the proximity of the hot springs and also for strategic reasons as it is located between the Rhineland and northern France.[14] Einhard mentions that in 765–6 Pepin spent both Christmas and Easter at Aquis villa (Et celebravit natalem Domini in Aquis villa et pascha similiter.),[15] ("and [he] celebrated Christmas in the town Aquis, and similarly Easter") whic
[08:21:06] <morf> h must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months.
[08:21:32] <morf> ch sounds different here but nice pun :) 
[08:21:51] <Panther> :)
[08:22:06] <Panther> I wouldn't trust anyone named Pepin.
[08:22:10] <morf> but i would probably go check aachen if i could 
[08:22:13] <morf> hehe
[08:22:20] <morf> yeah i bet they didn't 1k years ago
[08:22:28] <morf> sounds scatchy 
[08:22:34] <morf> and he was probably dwarf(ish) 
[08:23:01] <morf> Pepin's father Charles Martel died in 741.
[08:23:09] <morf> i wouldn't trust anybody called charles martel either
[08:23:12] <Panther> Damn.. I didn't even know he was sick.
[08:23:59] <Panther> Charles Martel sounds like a clothing designer.

[08:25:06] <Panther> Charlemagne was the father of many children. :)
[08:25:10] <morf> Historical opinion[who?] often seems to regard him as the lesser son and lesser father of two greater men, though a great man in his own right. He continued to build up the heavy cavalry which his father had begun.

[08:46:00] <morf> that's how shops looked like when we had commies
[08:46:18] <morf> Sven Seidel was appointed CEO of the company in March 2014, after the previous CEO Karl-Heinz Holland stepped down.

[08:46:35] <morf> ICH BIN KARL! HEINZ! HOLLAND!

[08:47:14] <morf> Seidel stepped down from his position in February 2017 after Manager Magazin reported he had fallen out of favour with Klaus Gehrig,

[08:47:34] <morf> Lidl announced plans to acquire 27 Best Market stores in New York and New Jersey
[08:47:35] <morf> rofl
[08:47:50] <morf> In August 2020, Lidl announced that it planned to open up another 50 stores in the U.S. by the end of 2021.
[08:48:25] <morf> Like fellow German supermarket Aldi, Lidl has a zero waste,[19] no-frills, "pass-the-savings-to-the-consumer" approach of displaying most products in their original delivery cartons, allowing the customers to take the product directly from the carton. When the carton is empty, it is simply replaced with a full one. Staffing is minimal.
[08:48:28] <morf> yeah
[08:48:54] <morf> i was bit shocked when i was in those old stores where everything was just bulk packed stuff 
[08:48:56] <morf> i was like ftw 
[08:49:19] <morf> In January 2012, Lidl launched bakeries in their stores across Europe. They consist of a small baking area with a number of ovens, together with an area where bread and pastries, such as croissants, are displayed for sale. The bakeries were initially trialed in a limited number of stores, to determine whether there was a demand for freshly baked products in-store.
[08:49:25] <morf> oh yeah german loves their ovens ehm
[08:49:30] <Panther> :)
[08:49:40] <morf> in this store the baking area smells so foul

[19:55:50] <Panther> See that rock face? Around the bottom are thickets of thorny bramble bushes.
[19:56:30] <murthy> oh ok. So why do yo say "a while ago"?
[19:56:34] <Panther> They come on slowly, especially if you are more focused on finding secure climbing holds, and not expecting to be encased in thorns.
[19:56:56] <murthy> oh you were referring the last time you went?
[19:56:56] <Panther> It was 6 days ago.
[19:57:00] <murthy> oh ok

[19:57:54] <Panther> I used running shoes with no socks :P

[19:58:26] <murthy> It would be very slippery
[19:58:31] <Panther> I am glad I had on shorts, actually.. the scratches on my legs are almost healed. If I had my pants on, I would have been truly caught.
[19:58:47] <murthy> ya
[19:59:03] <murthy> But I would say it was a good adventure
[19:59:13] <Panther> It was slippery.. it has been snowing that morning.
