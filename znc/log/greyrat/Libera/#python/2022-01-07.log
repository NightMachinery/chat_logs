[00:43:43] <yaf_lit1222> Hello! I am new to Python and working with it for one month. Right now I am trying to make a Sqlite-Database searcher. At the moment I have two main files: logic.py and gui2.py; In the logic I create the search sql command and in the gui2 I show the Database, in which can be added some more data. If I run the gui2 directly  with "app =
[00:43:44] <yaf_lit1222> QApplication(sys.argv)" its possible with "app.focusChanged.connect(self.focus_changed)" to track if the focus has been changed. But if I open the window with the logic.py with "self.w = MyWindow()" and "self.w.show()" its not possible to track it, because "NameError: name 'app' is not defined". I tried some things, but couldnt manage it. Can
[00:43:44] <yaf_lit1222> someone help me?

[01:21:53] <Yhg1s> Xano: the *class*'s __get__ isn't called when you access methods on it. Do you mean __getattribute__? Or do you mean the methods aren't methods, but callables that define their own __get__? (The methods' __get__ getting called is how they become methods, that's what the function object's __get__ is for.)

[01:45:14] <mat001_> In the .../bin dir of my virtualenv, created by pipenv, I have these python binaries: python, python3, python3.9. pipenv --py gives me "/virtualenvs/python-sdk-kPm-EHD0/bin/python". Which python is this? Could it be py 2?
[01:45:36] <grym> mat001_: in a venv, python _always_ means "the version of the interpreter used to create this venv"
[01:45:43] <grym> in your exapython
[01:45:55] <grym> in your example, python and python3 and python3.9 are the same file
[01:45:57] <Yhg1s> mat001_: all of those are the same python.
[01:46:01] <grym> or, point to the same place
[01:46:12] <grym> (exapython?!)
[01:46:56] <grym> mat001_: `ls -al /virtualenvs/python-sdk-kPm-EHD0/bin/` will probably show you that most of those are symlinks
[01:47:31] <mat001_> grym: yeah, I created venv with pipenv install --python 3.9. BUT I'm asking because flake8 gives me E999 error: E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax when I run it against requirements file. SO shows that's when you run the code with Py2 and lint with Py3. So I thought I might have been running my code with Py2. But looks like I am actually runing it with Py3.
[01:47:37] <mat001_> So where is E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax coming from/
[01:47:48] <grym> mat001_: those usually come with line numbers
[01:47:54] <grym> sometimes it's the line _after_ the problem
[01:47:57] <mat001_> ?? Line numbers?
[01:48:10] <grym> syntax errors have line numbers on 'em often
[01:48:12] <ChrisWarrick> mat001_: show your code and full traceback
[01:48:15] <Yhg1s> mat001_: can you show how you're running flake8 and the output you get?

[03:13:53] <BtbN> YakoYoku, I think I found it. cftime (and probably a bunch of other packages) download numpy as build-time dependency. And they just default to the latest version. So they grab 1.22, but the final env has 1.21, because something depends on <1.22.

[06:59:09] * SnoopJ would probably just write some tests 'a novo'
[07:00:14] <SamuelMarks> My latin sucks, but I assume au naturel SnoopJ :P
[07:00:23] <SnoopJ> de novo? new, specific to your parser
[07:00:45] <SamuelMarks> Ah yep, de novo Google told me the meaning of
[07:01:25] <SnoopJ> SamuelMarks, CPython doesn't really care about concrete syntax when it comes to whitespace, the language is pretty explicitly flexible about this. So you'll probably not find what you're looking for in CPython.
[07:01:37] <SamuelMarks> SnoopJ - Yeah that's what I've been going with thus far. - It's reasonably good at disambiguating, and it's two phases (scanner and parser) so it's much cleaner than first pass
[07:01:43] <SnoopJ> and even if you did, you are working on a much much more specific problem domain
[07:01:55] <SnoopJ> so you are probably a better judge of what is relevant to test to ensure operation of what you're building
[07:02:31] <SnoopJ> hypothesis could possibly be useful to "inflate" valid programs by adding whitespace in the places it's allowed, though

[07:03:55] <SnoopJ> SamuelMarks, I remember talking about this previously, and I am telling you that what you want is not something CPython really cares about

[07:04:32] <SamuelMarks> Which should be especially straightforward considering the only elements my manipulations touch are `Assign`, `AnnAssign`, the `.return` on `AsyncFunctionDef` and `FunctionDef` and the `Constant` or `Str` of a function/class (its docstring)

[07:07:43] <SnoopJ> "unparsed AST node" sounds like a direct contradiction in terms, but I think I understand what you mean: you are interested in doing source-to-source transformations that preserve features that would be lost from the concrete to abstract trees.
[07:08:11] <SnoopJ> If there were a great test suite for testing your tool, your tool would probably be attached to the far side of them, and you wouldn't have had to write it.

[08:46:58] <Sabry> Do you know why SnoopJ
[08:48:04] <SnoopJ> Sabry, because you are iterating what you read(), and iterating a byte object gives you integers

[08:50:27] <SnoopJ> Sabry, you can also maybe make use of `os.copy_file_range()` to copy 8K bytes at a time, although that's Linux-specific.

[15:12:09] <The-Compiler> As for *accessing* attributes of self, in other languages (like many C++ projects) you just end up with conventions like using "m_" for member variables. They are two inherently different namespaces, and I see no good rationale to merge them.

[15:21:48] <vanessa> then use `this` keyword. but now that I think about it, `this` is `self`, but in C++/Java land, as long as no local member conflict with a class member, `this` is not required.
[15:22:01] <The-Compiler> vanessa: conceptually, an instance variable and a local variable in a function are two very different things. Yet most languages have them in the same namespace. With "self" representing the instance, Python has them nicely separated, which I find much more reasonable

[16:48:24] <bancroft> Yhg1s: Then i'm fresh out of ideas how to install sqlite. I've pip installed with my pyenv pip (python -m pip install pysqlite3) and I get a module not found _sqlite3
[16:48:50] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[16:49:24] <ChrisWarrick> bancroft: sqlite3 is built into python
[16:49:38] <Yhg1s> bancroft: sqlite3 is a standard library module. it's not pysqlite3. the 'pysqlite3' pip package gives you 'pysqlite3'.
[16:49:39] <ChrisWarrick> bancroft: however, if you build your python without sqlite3 available in your system, it won’t exist

[16:50:14] <bancroft> So you're suggesting that this version of python from pyenv is broken, that makes sense
[16:50:26] <Yhg1s> bancroft: what you need to do is install the requirements for building Python's sqlite3 module with apt, and then rebuilding your Python interpreter so the build picks it up. It's probably libsqlite3-dev
[16:50:35] <Yhg1s> bancroft: it's not broken. It's just not built with sqlite3.

[18:25:04] <bjs> SnoopJ: I quite like thinking about testing, validation, linting, formatting etc all under the same bucket of "confidence building"
[18:25:19] <bjs> it's not about finding bugs (per se) but about gradually becoming more and more confident in the system
[18:25:33] <SnoopJ> bjs, I wouldn't quite put "formatting" itself in that category but I agree on the others
[18:25:52] <SnoopJ> (now, choosing a format that is consistent across developers...)
[18:25:59] <bjs> So many C security vulnerabilities because of `if (x = y)` have elevated styleguides to that role
[18:26:00] <bjs> (sadly)
[18:26:18] <SnoopJ> mm, and one-line clauses that become not-one-line
[18:26:23] <bjs> yes
[18:26:29] <SnoopJ> and someone thought it "looked better" without braces
[18:26:42] <bjs> a style that says you don't have those forms at all improves confidence
[18:27:37] <SnoopJ> including confidence in "we can go in here and work on this thing when it inevitably breaks without a lot of pre-work to get oriented"
[18:28:05] <bjs> (Although I agree a lot of style guides and unit tests and so on is _also_ about ease of the developers life)
[18:28:45] <bjs> in an ideal world, perhaps those ideas would be related (things that make developers lives easier would make software better) but who knows :P

[19:42:42] <Deneb> grym: just had a look at your link. It isn't available in the Ubuntu repository, but I see it can be installed using pip. Haven't really used pip myself. I seem to remember having a lot of trouble with it on Windows, but usually because there was a compile process that often failed - which never seemed to be a problem on Linux. Do devs use pip to install modules?
[19:43:17] <Wooble> Deneb: it's rarely even a problem on Windows these days; most packages provide wheels.
[19:43:21] <Deneb> Ubuntu/Mint O/S devs usually encourage sticking to apt so I have avoided it

[20:33:19] <SnoopJ> Guest40, are you asking about the pros vs conda envs?
[20:33:24] <Guest40> ya
[20:33:33] <SnoopJ> as I said, they don't do the same thing.
[20:33:35] <akk> Guest40: conda is way more heavyweight than just making a venv, and commits you to using the conda ecosystem for nearly everything.
[20:33:43] <Guest40> okay
[20:33:52] <SnoopJ> if all you care about is having an isolated Python environment, venv solves that problem quite well.

[21:06:44] <SnoopJ> Deneb, it should draw ticks by default. If you want to change where they're located, yticks() can do that. I recommend consulting the matplotlib gallery, there are a number of examples that should give you some ideas
[21:06:45] <akk> Is it considered bad style to import inside a function? For instance, if the package is only needed in that one function?

[21:09:26] <wyre> but ... anyway this is not apparently working as I expected
[21:10:08] <akk> SnoopJ: Where? In __main__  after parsing the args?
[21:10:08] <SnoopJ> akk, if the imported thing is necessary for the function, it might make sense to not even define the function when the condition is not met. Or there's the possibility of extras as grym pointed out. There aren't one-size-fits-all answers to this kind of thing, it depends very strongly on details
[21:10:15] <Deneb> SnoopJ: its the library documentation that I am trying to follow - with some difficulty. There seems to be no function that allows me to specify that I want a grid with range -4/+4 on the Y axis and -5/+5 on the X -axis.  If I specify 0-10 it will draw with a starting position of 0 and ending at 10. If I specify -5,+5 then it draws from -4.5 to +4.5. Does not make sense?

[21:10:56] <akk> The specific case here: pip_search uses rich for printing its table. But I'm adding an option to run it and get results back, without printing the table, so rich isn't needed except in the table-printing cases.
[21:11:18] <SnoopJ> Deneb, limits and ticks are completely separated from each other. The grid you are asking about will require you to control both. If you want gridlines too, there's grid().

[22:58:09] <SnoopJ> scrapy does both the "go get that document" and "parse that document" parts
[22:58:22] <SnoopJ> and it supports XPath 💙
[22:58:42] <akk> lantech19446: For instance, if there's a <table id="addresses"> and every row has first column being a name, second column is street address, third column is city, etc. then that's really easy to read in BS.
[22:58:59] <SnoopJ> you can get by just grabbing a document with the `requests` library and parsing it with BS4 or lxml, though, if you find scrapy to be a lot of library.
[22:59:01] <lantech19446> SnoopJ: yesterday I was told that it wouldn't pull from a url that I needed requests for that, that's why I wrote it that way lol

[22:59:43] <SnoopJ> lantech19446, whoever told you that gave you bad information. I don't know if scrapy uses requests on your behalf, but it most certainly will retrieve documents from URLs, that's one of its main functionalities.
