[00:16:55] <haslo> a little while ago i asked if i should stop ssh-agent processes when logging out so that other processes will not be able to get to the decrypted keys in memory. i did some digging around and i dont think the fear is warranted. both linux and windows do in fact prevent processes from reading/writing other processes memory. further, they memory gets blanked when the memory is given up.
[00:16:55] <haslo> (https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/29019/are-passwords-stored-in-memory-safe ) But the answer im linking mentions it being possible to read other processes memory using ptrace. but it is possible to prevent being ptraced, and ssh-agent does this (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-keyring/+bug/572045

[00:37:58] <hexnewbie> luva4: If the USB connection is stable and doesn't disconnect, sure, why not. If the USB host, gadget (enclosure), cable, janitor is shaky, then no, as you need to have swap on a more reliable storage, or a kernel panic may ensue on a disconnection. But if that disk also holds the OS, that would also not matter.

[07:38:59] <sheep> you might need to do that. If it's linux then by default it probably doesn't have the ip_forward sysctl option enabled, so it won't forward to 10.0.0.212
[07:39:03] <ayecee> nope
[07:39:10] <ayecee> no forwarding involved here
[07:39:17] <sheep> you also need 10.0.2.212 to forward packets to the other device through 10.0.0.17

[08:05:35] <ayecee> what a weird thing to google for
[08:05:38] <seanicus> But anyways, would openvpn possibly help?
[08:06:04] <rascul> it's just a different thing you have to setup
[08:06:07] <labrador> yeah it would stop weird firewall rules from being put up. The downside being you need to make your own killswitch
[08:06:21] <ayecee> nah. openvpn can set up the same kind of rules, for the same reason.
[08:06:36] <labrador> oh I didn't know

[10:13:51] <UPXTcgv7> I am not an unreasonable person, rustytaco.  I realize there are bugs, problems, and errors on every OS.  That said, desktops have been around for decades.  For a bug or error to be so bad that it crashes the whole machine while doing something extremely simple is terrible!  If this were a Microsoft OS, some might be threatening to sue!  I have no interest in a tablet.  If the linux kernel can't handle the software without crashing, it or other open
[10:13:51] <UPXTcgv7> source software that runs on must be to blame.  Surely you are not countering the kernel is stable if the software it runs crashes it?
[10:13:57] <cisco87> maybe he's conceiving a kid that will setup the linux box
[10:13:58] <joo-_> i think debian 11 has a pretty stable and decent desktop experience, so i am not sure why anyone would want to "contaminate" that with ubuntu

[15:23:31] <Donkey_A> https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=226579 and Realtek S1220A under Linux Mint 18.1 support for the S1220A chipset was introduced in Linux Kernel 4.11. Linux Mint 18.1 ships with kernel 4.4,
[15:23:33] <Gaboradon> Donkey_A: It's not that big of a deal as gaming isn't my primary thing these days, at least on linux, so I can live like this, but I kinda understand that I have a rather recent HW so the drivers might not be there, but it's been one year since I bought this mobo so yeah maybe there's an issue in my specific case.

[15:59:51] <p0g0_> stanrifkin, nope
[15:59:57] <Donkey_A> the driver is in kernel
[15:59:57] <ananke> cerl: and as a side note, I've been using linux in a professional setting since mid 90's. I've gone through ipfwadm, ipchains, iptables, now nftables/bpf. I have plenty of experience, but I still recognize the need for decent UI to exist for other people

[16:00:47] <cerl> I never meant any attempt to offend ananke nor did I wish to imply I was smart for using the command line. I just prefer the command line as a personal preference.
[16:01:05] <ananke> stanrifkin: right, but those are dedicated firewall/router appliance distros, not generic 'I have a desktop/laptop'. border firewalls have limited functionality, they won't protect your travelling laptop
[16:01:26] <p0g0_> Confesedicus, a major virtue of CLI stuff is that it is scriptable, something not so easy to do with a GUI.
[16:01:40] <ananke> cerl: and that's fine _for you_. what you need to realize is that there is a large world of users out there, with varied level of experience and familiarity

[16:02:21] <p0g0_> stanrifkin, the one I mentioned, Shorewall- been around for a couple of decades, proven, effective, and scalable... also all file based.
[16:02:23] <Confesedicus> As market share increases, wouldn't it be more of a target? And if so, wouldn't it be better for the more novice distros to setup the firewall & some sort of antivirus for users? A common approach for the kernel would be helpful. UFW not sure if that's exclusive to Ubuntu or already in there 🤔
[16:02:29] <djph> Confesedicus: although a "malware detector" in kernelspace would probably go against the LKML's bit about "the kernel shouldn't break userspace"
[16:02:32] <Confesedicus> Userspace**
[16:02:42] <cerl> There's hardly any viruses for linux in the wild though.
[16:02:57] <cerl> If you have an ad blocker you should avoid like more than half of malware.
[16:03:16] <Confesedicus> Userspace is just anything that's on top of a kernel right? And ah,
[16:03:18] <labrador> Confesedicus, the kernel won't do that,but a userland process can.

[16:03:39] <djph> as for firewall, that's debatable too -- the generally "open and listening for random connections" services out of hte box tend to be pretty low...
[16:04:03] <ananke> p0g0_: and it's not really a UI, it's just a front-end wrapper for iptables

[16:05:39] <labrador> cerl, does docker punch holes in firewalls?
[16:05:42] <djph> ananke: yeah, but I mean I can see why a distro doesn't put a "and drop everything" firewall in by default

[16:06:08] <djph> ananke: I'm not saying it's necessarily "a good idea" though

[16:06:14] <stanrifkin> cerl: does ufw alert when some "new" application wants to phone home?

[17:47:09] <Donkey_A> BCMM: While I agree with you, I also don't agree with you, I think words should always be allowed, I also feel sad about what RMS said, like something is crazy, i.e. "Even when it is uncontroversial to call the subject depicted a "child", that is no excuse for censorship," he added. "Having a photo or drawing does not hurt anyone, so and if you or I think it is disgusting, that is no excuse for censorship."
[17:47:14] <Common-Lisp> for example, Stallman's rant about pronouns manages to piss off EVERYONE, which is very funny.
[17:47:25] <Confesedicus> Ah so then yes, it's pretty much separated. Can't hit someone harsher just because they have a more public role. For e.g. can have an official account and then a personal one on Twitter. Being famous sounds like it sucks for life

[18:14:12] <Donkey_A> I think the first conversation in that case should be better put as in "Does a 17 years old have enough maturity to decide for himself? Should we test each teenager to see if he is mature enough?"
[18:14:29] <Donkey_A> but since we live in a society and we can't individually test everyone, we picked an average age
[18:14:34] <Donkey_A> at 18 for everyone
[18:14:34] <ProfSimm> stanrifkin: technically all laws are artificial. I've been thinking about similar things like tax brackets. You can "smooth them over" with a math formula, but then would the average bloke out pull their calculator and calculate a formula before they decide to bang a teen?
[18:15:01] <Very_Confused_Ag> there seems to be consistent levels, I dont think its completely arbitrary to have as a line in general, since you can really scan everyones brains to see what goes on. Plus social rules aren't bad
[18:15:04] <labrador> stanrifkin, well every age defined by the law will be bad,as its entirely binary. Either its illegal,or not.
[18:15:15] <obvs> Donkey, like someone said earlier, just because a view is oppressed or moderated, does not mean that view or oppression goes away. So, are you suggesting that 17 year olds do not engage in intercourse, or that the intercourse they engage in always lacks any form of consent due to their maturity?
[18:15:40] <Very_Confused_Ag> every time I type a it seems to ping someone, is that intentional or should I be doing something different

[18:16:01] <obvs> Because if that's what you're saying, I categorically disagree. I also put forward that, we do not know the full circumstances
[18:16:01] <ProfSimm> labrador: I propose probabilistic law. You throw dice, add the result to the age, and this determines if what you did is illegal
[18:16:06] <stanrifkin> i remind you that he defended his doctor father minsky, which i think he knew very good.

[20:37:28] <vitali64> Their netinstall iso is less than 512MB

[23:12:34] <Gaboradon> stanrifkin: Yes sound does work ,but it may be some kind of onboard AMD APU sound and not really the S1220A being fed into the Line Out.
[23:12:47] <Gaboradon> That's one of my theories.

[23:26:54] <Gaboradon> Confusing is this: device.vendor.name = "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD]", but SupremeFX S1220A is Realtek ALC1220, what does it have to do with AMD? Is it perhaps due to the chipset having sometihng to do with it?

[23:34:38] <monkeyPlus> need some help here...i can mount the usb drive on desktop. But when i do fdisk -l , it doesn show any partition
[23:34:57] <Cjefke_> partitions are not required.
[23:35:13] <monkeyPlus>  i see
[23:35:24] <monkeyPlus> can i apply a partition to a filled disk?
[23:35:41] <monkeyPlus> but i did make mkfs.ext4
[23:35:44] <monkeyPlus> dont understand
[23:36:07] <Cjefke_> e.g., if it is entirely an lvm pv then it may have lv's in it (perhaps partly).
[23:36:24] <uwharrie> that adds a file system to a block device. a whole disk is a block device, a partition is a block device, an LVM volume is a block device
[23:36:38] <uwharrie> you can mix and match those layers as you see fit
[23:36:51] <monkeyPlus> ok
[23:37:04] <Cjefke_> man this bridge prefixing sucks.
