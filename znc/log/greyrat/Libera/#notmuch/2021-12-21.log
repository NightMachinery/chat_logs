[05:39:05] <rlb> I can't recall (suspect I've asked this before), but is there some way to copy a url in an email, or even just expose the decoded href so I can copy it via normal emacs methods?
[05:44:07] <bremner> rlb: if it's an html part, then I think yes, otherwise it probably requires a bit of work
[05:44:42] <rlb> I just mean a buttonized link, say an "unsubscribe" link in a list mail, though yeah, in this case, I think it was html.
[05:44:50] <bremner> in html parts, you can look at the text-property "shr-url"
[05:45:05] <bremner> also there might be a keybinding
[05:45:20] <rlb> Yeah, I'd like to just be able to hit some key(s) or say right click and "copy link", or...
[05:45:24] <bremner> ascii 79 is shr-save-contents
[05:45:27] <bremner> s?
[05:45:33] <rlb> hmm
[05:46:11] <rlb> well plain s in the buffer is "notmuch search".
[05:46:29] <rlb> when the cursor is on the link
[05:46:50] <rlb> yeah, C-h m for that buffer doesn't list that function.
[05:46:54] <rlb> (here)
[05:47:47] <rlb> Anyway, context is that in some cases I may have multiple firefox instances/profiles open and I need to paste the link into a particular one...
[05:48:36] <bremner> try M-x shr-copy-url
[05:48:52] <bremner> (when on the link, in an html part)
[05:50:44] <bremner> I'd have to dig into the source to figure out what sets up links in the text parts. It should be possible to do something similar
[06:01:27] <rlb> Yep, that does it -- now the question is, did you already tell me that a while back and I forgot...  Thanks much, and I wonder where that'd best be documented (have to go see where it's defined first I suppose.)
[06:02:12] <bremner> C-u C-x = is how I found it
[06:02:21] <bremner> there's a keymap bound to links

[18:52:36] <monadgauge> apologies if this gets asked a lot, but why is hard to sync notmuch between multiple machines?
[18:52:37] <monadgauge>  the only reccomended solution i've been able to find is the remote guide on the website, and muchsync worries me a bit since it seemingly doesn't have a public mainling list.
[19:19:22] <martinj> I am quite dependent on muchsync nowadays... fortunately so far it has worked really well.
[19:22:12] <bremner> monadgauge: not sure if you really want to discuss the reasons or if you want suggestions for how to do it?
[19:23:17] <monadgauge> bremner: both, i would like to understand what the problem is as well as suggestions for solutions that i can try/look into
[19:23:53] <bremner> well, I guess the problem is that most people have something that is "good enough". Either muchsync or something based on dump/restore
[19:24:17] <bremner> for suggestions, you could try something using dump/restore
[19:24:51] <monadgauge> what are the issues with the dump/restore workflow? or just keeping the databse in sync using like syncthing or dropbox or something like that?
[19:25:42] <bremner> well, the database is much bigger than the output of dump. And you'd have to lock it to sync using a generic file syncher
[19:26:42] <bremner> the dump/restore stuff is all a bit homebrew. In principle you can use nmbug from the notmuch source; I'm not sure how many people use it that way
[19:27:41] <monadgauge> from my reading it seems that other than conflict resolution, tring to sync the database directly might be problematic because it might be implemented differently on different computers. is that right?
[19:28:03] <monadgauge> and if the database is bigger than the output of dump, is there infromation loss on dump/resotre?
[19:28:35] <bremner> no. But the database includes things that can be reconstructed by running "notmuch new"
[19:28:56] <bremner> afaik the database format is architecture independent
[19:30:32] <monadgauge> gotcha. does muchsync development happen somewhere i've missed?
[19:31:00] <monadgauge> does it esstentailly automate the manual dump/restore workflow or is it more complex than that?
[19:31:02] <bremner> I don't know, I think it's just one guy, but there is a public git repo iirc
[19:31:07] <bremner> it is more complex
[19:31:10] <bremner> and faster
[19:31:22] <monadgauge> yeah the git repo is public, but it's not exactly a publically developed project
[19:31:33] <bremner> you're welcome discuss muchsync on the notmuch list
[19:31:40] <bremner> the author subscribes
[19:31:50] <monadgauge> i see
[19:32:12] <monadgauge> if you don't mind me asking, what do you use for syncing?
[19:32:36] <bremner> dump > git, sync via git, restore
[19:33:19] <monadgauge> how long does a sync take for you on average?

[19:36:11] <bremner> about 15s, but it includes fetching from an imap server, and fetching another server via ssh
[19:41:42] <monadgauge> bremner: gotcha. thanks for the help!
[19:42:18] <bremner> good luck.
[19:42:34] <bremner> I should probably try switching to nmbug on dogfooding principle.
