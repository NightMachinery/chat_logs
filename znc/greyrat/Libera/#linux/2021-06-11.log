If the user elects not to overwrite, they can specify an alternative file. In that case, is there a way to determine where the output was redirected, from a variable or something?

[06:46:27] <yukiup> i like the taskbar on the top
[06:46:33] <Rakko> Is there any project that's like an overlay filesystem, such that if any files are created or files are renamed on that filesystem, it checks to see if the proposed filename has certain characters, and if it does, they're translated into something else?
[06:46:52] <Rakko> My use case is to have a $HOME that's guaranteed to be free of files with spaces and CRs in their names -- so I can more confidently use various Unixy utilities without worrying about the presence of those two characters.

[06:48:39] <Rakko> I know. But it does for me. I would much rather be able to just pipe the output of any arbitrary file-finding command to a filter program than have to wrangle special characters. Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty well-versed in find PREDICATE -exec CMD + and the like, but sometimes I'd like things to be simpler

[06:50:30] <ananke> problem is, fuse based $HOME is going to incur performance penalty that's _always_ present, as opposed to having to account for files with spaces, which occur rarely

[08:57:39] <rascul> but i don't seem to have a man page for covid, either
[08:59:04] <bkool> rascul, telling someone to get vaccinated doesn't make you an auth source on vaccines. enough people have been vaccinated that any hesitance is unwarranted. it's more of a PSA at this point.
[09:00:05] <rascul> it's almost like nobody considers that there might be adverse affects years later

Strace reveals a netlink -ELOOP message being returned. I narrowed it down to just the bridge itself, by removing all slaves. This worked fine for months and no recent changes. Reboot doesn't resolve it.
[09:09:18] <b0nn> Linux telling ppl to get vaccinated needs to be taken in context - someone started talking anti-vax on the kernel mailing list, so he told them it wasn't the place to do it, and that vaccines have saved millions of lives around the world

[17:34:34] <BCMM> just using the `sftp` command instead is a bad solution because it's a hell of a lot more complicated for simply moving a single file to a location you already know. rsync is great for many situations, but you have to have it installed on the server...
[17:35:31] <phogg> BCMM: agreed, and it all sounds good until you start looking in to the corner cases.
[17:35:49] <phogg> there probably can't be a drop-in replacement for scp that works without replicating its problems
[17:36:06] <phogg> that said, you can get a drop-in replacement that covers *most* typical usage. I expect that's where we'll land (eventually)
[17:36:46] <BCMM> that's why i think it would make sense for distros or individual sysadmins to decide whether to install such a command as `scp` or to give it a new name and thus preserve compatibility
[17:37:29] <BCMM> in much the same way that we tolerate `vi` being linked to editors that don't have perfect compatibility with *real* vi
[17:39:42] <BCMM> hah, the first hit for "sftp noninteractive" on google is "use scp instead"...

[19:05:47] <akk> I think a lot of problems like that boil down to developers tending to have fast modern machines so it never even occurs to them that there are other use models.
[19:05:52] <BCMM> pa: rather than improving the behaviour of the kernel oom-killer, you can run a daemon that tries to kill before the kernel would, like earlyoom
[19:05:58] <peetaur> iotop shows all kde and kate processes at low io wait ... stupid thing ....it's probably one of those stupid kde services I don't need that is doing something dumb on an unneeded disk...like to fill up the list of devices available when you "save as", it has to stat each fs ...maybe something stupid like that
[19:06:03] <hexnewbie> Oh, I'm having that too. Every day I would do something, and it hang for a moment as I hear a HD head unparking itself. But I attributed it to having symlinks to the hard drive in ~/ (I'd assume even mc is doing it)

[19:10:09] <pa> prussian, it's not just that, when the system freezes, i can see the System Load Viewer bar turning almost full red (sys time)
[19:10:09] <BCMM> pa: sorry, what's the context for "sys" cpu time?
[19:10:17] <hexnewbie> pa: One place that's available it's in the cpu lines in /proc/stat *but* it is not amount of system CPU%, it's time spent in system since boot, so you'd have to poll twice and compute
[19:10:24] <peetaur> are there even per-process sys/user/wait/etc stats? I only ever see that system-wide in tools, like top
[19:10:41] <hexnewbie> pa: It's also annoyingly in some arcane unit.

[19:11:57] <hexnewbie> pa: It's in clock ticks, the unit differs from machine to machine, you need getconf CLK_TCK to get it, then divide by the number you get to turn it into seconds.
[19:12:08] <pa> BCMM, not even that, i want to see when sys > 60%, then spin killall firefox

Yes, I could disconnect existing socketio connection with Bob and then connect with Frank else with 2 connections, message from myself will be reached to 2 users. I don't want that. Now the question is -- is there any solution to connect with Frank

[19:18:35] <pa> that might be a simpler way indeed

[19:31:28] <apocalyptech> Hola!  So when you have a source control conflict on a text file, you'll end up with a syntax which puts, for instance `<<<<<<< HEAD` at the top of the conflict, `=======` between 'em, and `>>>>>>> commitid` afterwards
[19:31:43] <apocalyptech> Or at least I've seen that as far back as the old CVS days, and git uses that syntax too
[19:32:06] <apocalyptech> I've always just gone through and resolved those "by hand," but is there a utility which'll let me just pick one and do that for me?
[19:32:40] <ananke> problem is, which one should it pick for you?
[19:32:55] <apocalyptech> Dunno why just *now* I decided to look for such a thing, after literal decades doing it by hand.  :D  My Googling is failing me, though, 'cause of the genericness of the terms involved

[19:33:14] <akk> meld can do that.
[19:33:15] <apocalyptech> ananke: Oh, no, like I'd tell it "I want HEAD", or "I want commitid", for the simplest case where I'm not mixing-and-matching

[21:25:27] <BCMM> elagost: this was *ages* ago, but they had a ddrescue package that was incredibly old

[23:27:55] <slackadelic> I don't think the message is an 'issue' per se, I've been having odd timeout issues with the GUI itself
[23:28:07] <slackadelic> So I've been doing my upgrades from the command line updater, works fine
[23:29:38] <Mathisen> hmm il see what i do, gonna try solve it. i was thinking of changing to seafile instead anyway. nextcloud is getting way to bloated for my usecase anyway these days.
[23:29:54] <slackadelic> I'll have to look at seafile myself
[23:29:56] <Mathisen> i used it for years, but soooo many features now days and i use like 4 of em
[23:30:34] <slackadelic> Yeah

[23:50:27] <Kyv> It must be dead.
[23:50:31] <hexnewbie> No, it *is* Unix time. But you don't need it for CPU time. stime = stime_ticks / CLK_TCK. You'd need it for, say, program uptime, as you'd get program's start time with starttime = btime + starttime_ticks / CLK_TCK
[23:51:08] <Kyv> I mean it has just come as part of connman.

[23:52:22] <VMGuy234> Do you think Zen or Regular kernel would be better for my Intel Atom laptop with 1gb ram
[23:52:52] <hexnewbie> Or system% would be (stime_ticks1 - stime_tick0) / (CLK_TCK * (time1 - time0)) (but beware that you can't get current time and stime together atomically, so that will always be off). Also don't divide by CLK_TCK unless you're using double or some kind of floating point, of course.
