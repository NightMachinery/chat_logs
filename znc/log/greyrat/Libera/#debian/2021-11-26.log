[00:22:03] <sussudio> what could go wrong...
[00:22:21] <sussudio> also, chown, not chmod.
[00:22:33] <hackers> no I mean, I want all files create in a directory by any user, owned by a specific user without having to chmod
[00:22:44] <somiaj> yea, I think I missunderstood the question, they want something like the set gid bit to make it so new files are owned correctly
[00:22:53] <hackers> like if root does: touch /home/myself/newfile, I want that file to be owned by myself
[00:22:58] <somiaj> well you mean chown, and no I don't think this is possible.
[00:23:20] <somiaj> why do you want some other user to own that file?
[00:23:26] <hackers> I tried chmod u+rwxs but it doesn't work
[00:23:35] <sussudio> ...
[00:23:51] <hackers> exactly to avoid having to chownd
[00:23:54] <hackers> chown*
[00:24:11] <somiaj> why are you running root enough to create files that need to be owned by your normal user?
[00:24:19] <somiaj> anyawys, the best you can do is via a group they are both in
[00:24:23] <hackers> yo...

[00:28:28] <somiaj> you can make it so files are even given permissions so they are all writable to users of the group too

[00:43:27] <hackers> :)
[00:43:55] <somiaj> Your issue seemed like one others would have had, so I assumed there would be a more standard solution than trying to force this at the permissions level
[00:44:02] <somiaj> and indeed there was
[00:44:36] <hackers> someone in #docker said my application should still run if all files are owned by root and that I'm doing this wrong
[00:44:46] <hackers> now that they say this I completely forgot why I'm doing this in first place
[00:45:08] <somiaj> It also appears that if you use docker cp (instead of COPY), you get cp -a, but this requires the uid being the same inside and outside the continaer
[00:45:33] <hackers> but very nice
[00:45:38] <hackers>  => [stage-1 3/5] COPY --from=builder --chown=zdu-agent:zdu-agent /usr/src/zdu-dashboard /usr/src/zdu-dashboard                    74.2s

[01:13:25] <sussudio> !debian clone
[01:13:25] <dpkg> One method of cloning Debian installs is to take a current Debian machine that is set up with the packages you want and run the command "dpkg --get-selections > ~/selectionfile".  Then, after the base install on other machines use that file and do: "dpkg --set-selections < ~/selectionfile && apt-get dselect-upgrade".  Also ask me about <aptitude clone>, <reinstall>, <things to backup> <apt-clone>.
[01:15:27] *** Joins: Hurricane (~Hawker@user/hawker)
[01:15:55] <somiaj> !aptitude clone
[01:15:55] <dpkg> To clone a Debian machine using aptitude (or install your favourite packages) use aptitude search --disable-columns -F%p '~i!~M!~v' > package_list; on the reference machine; xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < package_list; aptitude install; on the other machine.  This preserves information about "automatically installed" packages that other methods do not.  See also <reinstall>, <things to backup>, <debian clone>, <apt-clone>.
[01:16:03] <somiaj> as an alternative to save auto/manual status
[01:18:03] <kian> I don't think either of those accomplish what I'm looking for, because I can't run dpkg or apt-get/aptitude on the broken machine. I'm wondering if there's a way to basically install packages into a chroot using apt/dpkg from the host?

[03:22:15] <bugweiser> Then what am I doing wrong? I can't find these /usr/sbin/*tables-*  files, neither do I have this update-alternatives group 'iptables' (or ip6tables, arptables and ebtables   that ?should? be there by default, if I understand the wiki correctly ...)

[03:28:40] <somiaj> the first part of the wiki talks about 'reverting to legacy' xtables, that is all appropraite if you want to use the legacy xtables, but you said you wanted to use nftables
[03:28:58] <somiaj> all of those alternatives are part of the iptables package, which someone wanting to revert to xtables woudl probably have installed

[03:33:40] <bugweiser> so, instaling iptables package sets up the '*tables-* groups for upadate-alternatives, additionally gives these corresponding binaries. And then /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy (from the legacy group, for example) is when you remove nft from your system and revert back to whatever came before that, while /usr/sbin/iptables-nft (and friend) try to interpret old-school commants and translate them to the nft system. Correct ?
[03:34:10] *** Joins: cdown_ (~cdown@89.32.122.5)
[03:34:16] <somiaj> correct, this is all for backwards comapdability and is not needed if you want to manually set nftables rules
[03:34:46] <somiaj> So this is for users who have old style rules and don't want to update, or for some firewall software that hasn't been updated to use nftables directly
[03:35:23] <bugweiser> ok, so I check I have nftables installed by checking I have: /usr/sbin/nft --help
[03:35:38] <somiaj> yup, which is default so you should have it installed
[03:35:51] <bugweiser> (which I do), so I could skip to: systemctl enable nftables.service

[05:52:47] <sney> it's irc, you send 1 line at a time, so your 1st line went to dpkg (which didn't know what to do with it anyway) and the rest came to the focused channel
[05:52:49] <bugweiser> (and 'comments after indentation')
[05:52:51] <somiaj> you did paste to the channel, /msg foo only sends the first line in a message, the rest come tot he channel
[05:52:51] <sney> that is just how irc works
[05:53:10] <sney> if you want to paste a code block for some reason, put it on a web paste service and link here, but you may want to lead with your actual question
[05:53:39] <bugweiser> sney, that is what must have happened. Sometimes I expect to much of xchat :)
[05:54:35] <sney> xchat is the client, irc is a protocol from the 1980s. adjust your expectations accordingly

[05:59:05] <bugweiser> oh, I know: "can whitespace (space/tab) appear before a comment starts?"  and  "can config lines end with comments?"
[06:00:17] <sney> depends, sometimes, I'm not sure re: netfilter
[06:00:37] <LtL> use separate lines for comments
[06:01:30] <sney> there is probably a man page detailing the config file syntax and what is/isn't explicitly allowed, though if there isn't anything illuminating there, #netfilter will probably be able to answer those two questions
[06:01:46] <sney> but as LtL suggests, keeping comments on separate lines is preferable anyway, esp. as it's more readable
[06:02:29] <bugweiser> personally i'm a big fan of trailing comments, neatly in their own column

[06:54:47] <ChetManly> dont want compositing at all
[06:55:36] <sney> typically, compositing is good since it will use the gpu (even your integrated intel or whatever) to render the gui, rather than trying to do it all in software

[07:40:59] <kveroneau> Mate brought in Compiz?  That's new.
[07:42:04] <kveroneau> I installed MATE into an LXC and use XSpice to connect to it, and I don't recall running into any Compiz issues.  MATE does use a lot of hardware rendering though, and in the display manager you can opt to log into MATE using the software renderer.
[07:42:26] <jmcnaught> ChetManly: have you logged out of your MATE session and looked at the available session types on the login screen?
[07:42:32] <kveroneau> But if you are looking for a DE with less dazzle, I wouldn't use a DE that seems to enforce some sort of rendering like MATE does.
[07:42:56] <xx> which takes priority for screen blanking/putting monitor to sleep/switching off monitor/locking screen? xscreensaver or Xfce Power Manager settings? If I were to guess, I'd say xscreensaver, because as far as the Xfce Power Manager knows, an app is actively running so the Xfce Power Manager won't do anything. However my testing has been poorly designed so far.
[07:43:58] <kveroneau> The Xfce power management for at least the DPMS settings might work like how the "xset" command controls the DPMS settings, so it would depend on the timeout set.
[07:44:50] <kveroneau> If XFce PM is set to time out before XScreensaver even has it's chance to shine, then the monitors will probably turn off before the screensaver gets it's chance to even start.
[07:45:32] <ChetManly> kveroneau, I looked no options in lightdm I can see
[07:46:03] <kveroneau> There isn't an option to choose a different "Session"?
[07:46:43] <kveroneau> I believe in my MATE test machine, it shows two session options, one for software rendering should be there.
[07:47:34] <kveroneau> But that isn't disabling the desktop effects, as now they'll just be rendered using software.  I'm sure there is a way to just use a different Window Manager with MATE tho, although I haven't tried.
[07:48:28] <kveroneau> You could say install Metacity, and try running it after logging into MATE like this "metacity --replace"  I believe is the option to force it to replace the existing Window Manager.
[07:48:45] <kveroneau> Ultimately disabling the desktop effects of course, as Metacity doesn't support those.
[07:48:54] <ChetManly> looks like the two options provide the same result
[07:48:59] <jmcnaught> metacity is called marco now
[07:50:01] <kveroneau> Oh, didn't know that.  In Buster at least, apt-getting "metacity" still works, but keep that rename in mind ChetManly if you are on Bullseye.
[07:50:32] <ChetManly> this is buster
[07:50:50] <ChetManly> vlc was glitching like crazy in bullseye
[07:51:02] <kveroneau> Okay, so try installing metacity, and use it's --replace option after logging in to MATE.
[07:51:04] <ChetManly> same test works good in buster
[07:51:20] <kveroneau> If --replace doesn't work, check the manpage for the correct option.
[07:51:57] <kveroneau> Most of my systems are still Buster as well.

[08:14:07] <kveroneau> I really like that awesome has the concept of a main window, and then sub-windows, the main window is always assigned the largest space, so say your IDE is the main window, then the output and debug windows next to it are naturally smaller by default.  You can also swap which application is your "main" app with a hotkey of course too.

[08:36:01] <sney> !why recommends
[08:36:01] <dpkg> From Debian 5.0 "Lenny" onwards, apt-get and aptitude both install "Recommended" packages by default. From <policy> section 7.2, Recommends, "declares a strong, but not absolute, dependency. The Recommends field should list packages that would be found together with this one in all but unusual installations." You're not that unusual, trust us. By not installing "recommended" packages you will be missing functionality.
[08:37:05] <ChetManly> sney, well how do I loose the stuff like thunderbird and stuff I dont need then?
[08:37:27] <ChetManly> rm it later?
[08:41:13] <sney> sure
[08:41:37] <kveroneau> You can use the "debfoster" package to remove those after.
[08:42:22] <kveroneau> Personally whenever I use --no-install-recommends, I scour the list of "Recommended" and add whatever in that list appears to needed for proper operation, and neglect the rest.
[08:42:54] <ChetManly> good idea
[08:43:11] <kveroneau> But, I've been installing some packages on repeat so much that I know what's more needed than something else.  So still be cautious.
[08:45:27] <kveroneau> It's how everyone else says KDE Plasma feels so bloated to them, and takes so much memory, while my daily-use install of KDE Plasma 5 after boot to desktop takes less than 1GB of RAM, and runs very well and is super stable. :)

[08:53:31] <kveroneau> Since when I used OpenBSD both GNOME and KDE were pretty terrible at the time, fvwm just worked in OpenBSD, so I just stuck with it.
[08:54:20] <kveroneau> DSL was a good time.
[08:54:31] <ChetManly> :-)
[08:54:50] <ChetManly> couldnt believe it when I first saw it

[08:55:36] <kveroneau> Ah, the early days of LiveCDs.
[08:56:09] <ChetManly> what year is it now?
[08:56:13] <ChetManly> ugh
[08:56:53] <kveroneau> It'll be only 2 decades since I got into UNIX-like systems soon enough.
[08:57:49] <kveroneau> I still remember salivating over Xen in an issue of Linux Magazine I had, wishing I had the PC to run Xen so I didn't need to dual-boot all the time to try different distros.
[08:58:29] <kveroneau> Nowadays, I'm living the dream with a much beefer PC, I never dual-boot distros, I just have a ton of VMs to try out various ones easily and effortlessly.
[08:59:16] <kveroneau> Which is also why I choose Debian as my host OS, as it's super stable, and libvirt runs really well on it.
[08:59:56] <kveroneau> I'd rather not need to upgrade my host OS every few months haha

[13:15:54] <Cool_Fire> You can usually resize & move stuff around with gparted enough to make more space. It's a nice and permanent solution, but it takes some work (and time)
[13:15:57] <Khepra> in theory no. GPT table is just offsets. like, pointers
[13:16:09] <Alphare> I'm assuming there's *something* useful in /boot/efi
[13:16:17] <Khepra> it's the ESP yes
[13:16:22] <Alphare> (I really am not too informed about how these things work)
[13:16:49] <Khepra> ESP is like a "boot sector" for UEFI systems. it's not a sector but a FAT32 partition flagged as  "esp" partition type
[13:16:59] <Khepra> ESP = EFI System Partition
[13:17:11] <Alphare> right
[13:17:29] <Alphare> I see it in gparted, makes sense
[13:17:54] <Alphare> (I've set up this PC 2 and a half years ago with an encrypted lvm2 partition
[13:18:05] <Alphare> I don't remember much)
[13:18:08] <Khepra> but it needn't be first. it just needs to be in the table somewhere, and marked as ESP, and be FAT32. that's why I think you can move it and reuse its 512M combined with whatever that is for /boot
[13:19:19] <jelly> Alphare, quick, slightly possibly unreliable fix: replaces MODULES=most with MODULES=dep in /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf
[13:19:30] <jelly> instant smaller initramfses.
[13:19:48] <Alphare> so, to recap: downsize p3 (the big one I've not shown), make a new ext2 "/boot2" (p4) partition, merge it with "/boot" (p2) and somehow I'm ok?

[13:21:55] <Khepra> Alphare: btw... as I see /boot is p2 really... you can move IT, instead of ESP, and you don't need to merge anything, just leave the 250+ MB gap if that doesn't bother your OCD

[15:06:05] <Rohambili>  Hi people! I'm a newbie in iptables or nftables. Can I get some suggestions where to start searching tutorials or sample files? I have a Debian 11 and I want to configure as a router which connecting to the net with pppoe and masquerade to a eth1 which configured with DHCP server and ipv6 with radvd or how it's called. And masquerade to eth2 which is will be in DMZ. And eth3 which local network without Internet. Any idea?

[21:07:58] <bugweiser> all that said, yes there is a dire need for a new mini-licence (preferrably with selection of the common 0-4 rules) which got the international legal aspect right. To the very best of my knowledge, none exist that fill that particular gap.
[21:08:14] <PerfDave> If warranty is your concern, there's nothing stopping anybody offering a warranty on e.g. GPL-licensed code. It just means that the *authors* of the code do not offer any inherent warranty. If $randomcorp wants to say "we've reviewed this code and decreed it appropriate for use in $product and are prepared to back that up in court", then that's fine.

[21:54:53] <CorvetteZR1> hello.  i moved my debian 11.1 vm from one host to another, and because of this, ens3 interface changed to enp0s2.  i changed this in /etc/network/interfaces, it starts and get the IP, but the routing is messed up...it have to set the default gateway manually and other vms can't talk to it.  outbound traffic seems OK, but not inbound.  i made sure i disabled the local firewall, etc, but it's still not replying
[21:55:26] <CorvetteZR1> what is the proper way to handle network interface name change in debian 11.1?  it seems like it's more then just changing it in the interfaces file...
[21:55:35] *** Quits: rsx (~dummy@ppp-188-174-142-187.dynamic.mnet-online.de) (Quit: rsx)
[21:56:04] <CorvetteZR1> if i move it back to the old host, ens3 comes up ok, even though i still have enp0s2 defined in the interfaces file...which is really surprising, it's as if that file is being ignored entirely
[21:56:09] <jelly> and that's why we disable "predictable interface naming" on all our VMs
[21:56:38] <jelly> but really iface name probably shouldn't be hardcoded in many other places
[21:56:42] <CorvetteZR1> jelly, agreed.  but this is a minimal install with one non critical service which i'm using to test the new node :)
[21:57:01] *** Quits: _NetEcho_ (~NetEcho@user/netecho) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[21:57:11] <CorvetteZR1> i wasn't expecting to have this issue.  this started as a debian 9 vm, been updated to 11.1 since...and things seem different now
[21:57:50] *** Quits: Spawn (~spawn@user/spawn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:58:02] <CorvetteZR1> it's not a big deal for me to just build a new vm from scratch for this service, but i plan to migrate other vms that i wouldn't want to rebuild from scratch, so would like to figure this out...
[21:58:33] <CorvetteZR1> is systemd doing funky things?  even though this is a minimal install with no ui, is network manager interfering somewhere?
[21:58:56] <randall> CorvetteZR1: It's unrelated to systemd. udev is renaming interfaces, and likely network-manager is bring up the device.
[21:58:58] <CorvetteZR1> can't find much info about this by searching, so hoping someone here can help...
[21:59:28] <bugweiser> hackers: I haven't yet run into issues with doas. I know (not which of the top of my head) there are some things doas can't do that sudo can, so it appears that for most tasks it just works (and is simple to setup).
[21:59:49] <jelly> CorvetteZR1, well do something dumb for a start, see if there's mention of "ens3" anywhere else.  find /etc -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep ens3
[21:59:49] *** Quits: node1 (~node1@user/node1) (Quit: Client closed)
[21:59:54] <randall> CorvetteZR1: But I'd look into disabling predictable interface naming on all your VMs, that's something that should actually happen automatically. Might be that your virtualized network card is not in the exception list.
[22:00:12] <jelly> dpkg, listvals net.ifnames=0
[22:00:14] <dpkg> Factoid search of 'net.ifnames=0' by value (1): dpni.
[22:00:23] <randall> dpni
[22:00:27] <randall> !dpni
[22:00:27] <dpkg> To disable Predictable Network Interface naming and revert back to the old interface naming, run "ln -s /dev/null /etc/systemd/network/99-default.link" as root (without quotes). Creating this symbolic link prevents systemd from being able to change interface names. You will need to unplug/replug your device or reboot/reload module. Alternatively add net.ifnames=0 to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in /etc/default/grub then run update-grub and reboot.

[22:02:05] <CorvetteZR1> hmmm, ok.  wonder if with eth0 it'll have same issues.  k, i'll give this a shot
[22:02:22] <jelly> so, still changed from ens3, but consistent across PCI bus and device changes as long as you only have one
