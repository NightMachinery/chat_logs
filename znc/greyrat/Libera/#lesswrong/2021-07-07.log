[23:02:50] <gwern> 'As Romney was trying to become the first Mormon president, The Book of Mormon musical was selling out on Broadway. Co-written by South Park’s creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the show skewered Mormonism with gleeful profanity and depicted its adherents as simpletons. My initial reaction, after listening to the soundtrack, was exasperation that this was how affluent theatergoers were...
[23:02:56] <gwern> ...being introduced to my faith. But I also felt compelled to be a good sport—and I wasn’t alone. When Romney was asked about the show, he said he’d love to see it: “It’s a Tony-award winner, big phenomenon!” And the Church itself took out ads in the playbill that read, “You’ve seen the play. Now read the book.” (The show’s creators had apparently anticipated something...
[23:03:02] <gwern> ...like this: Stone would later recount that when friends asked if he was concerned about Mormons protesting, he said, “Trust us, they’re going to be cool.”) I remember being delighted by the Church’s response. Such savvy PR! Such a good-natured gesture! See, everyone? We can take a joke! But then I met a theater critic in New York who had recently seen the musical. He marveled at how...
[23:03:09] <gwern> ...the show got away with being so ruthless toward a minority religion without any meaningful backlash. I tried to cast this as a testament to Mormon niceness. But the critic was unconvinced. “No,” he replied. “It’s because your people have absolutely no cultural cachet.”'

[23:34:47] <gwern> ggreer: graeber was a pretty crummy dude himself. you believe that bullshit about 'apple was founded by democratic circles of 20 to 40 ibm engineers...' was 'garbled by the copyeditors'?
[23:34:49] <feep> catern: the entire scene is great
[23:35:00] <ggreer> yeah that's a super weird response
[23:35:01] <feep> it's just goethe totally shitting on german intellectualism for like ten minutes
[23:35:16] <gwern> it's just a lie. a very obvious one. there is no copyediting in the world which has ever resulted in a 'garbling' like that
[23:35:35] <gwern> not even when the copyeditors were high on lsd and weed
[23:36:04] <ggreer> I don't get why he'd try to save face that way. it's not plausible. it's perfect english but it's somehow garbled?
[23:36:17] <gwern> and it's a particularly striking lie because graeber is punching down and blaming low-status workers for his own extraordinary ignorance
