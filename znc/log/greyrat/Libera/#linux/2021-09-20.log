[07:09:59] <MinusOne> kubuntu, are you talking dual boot?
[07:10:05] <kubuntu> yes
[07:10:09] <GalaxyNova> you can access windows files from linux if that's what you mean
[07:10:21] <MinusOne> you can make a partition they can both access, I think fat32 is generally recommended for that
[07:10:21] <kubuntu> viceversa too
[07:10:34] <GalaxyNova> you'll need ntfs-3g IIRC
[07:10:50] <GalaxyNova> if you want to see ntfs partitions from linux
[07:11:01] <GalaxyNova> I mean you
[07:11:13] <kubuntu> I just wanna share codes between windows and linux
[07:11:24] <GalaxyNova> be be able to see them without ntfs-3g but you'll need it to access it
[07:11:25] <mlu> I can see my NTFS partitions from Linux in gparted just fine :)
[07:11:36] <mlu> reading the contents inside, however, is another story (psst: you need ntfs-3g)
[07:11:36] <GalaxyNova> yeah
[07:11:38] <GalaxyNova> my bad
[07:11:47] <mlu> sorry, was in a slightly snarky mood
[07:11:47] <MinusOne> then you can either make a partition they can both easily access (like a fat32 one) or install drivers on each to access one another's filesystems
[07:12:01] <mlu> I recommend UDF for flash drives and SD cards
[07:12:16] <mlu> FAT32 is a good choice for smaller devices in which you don't plan to have any file >4GB stored

[07:13:56] <justsomeguy> That's true; networked storage is the way to go.

[07:20:04] <MinusOne> I think vfat is the one I was trying to think of. Been a while since I needed to share files in a dual boot

[16:58:50] <Psi-Jack> ss -lnp or whatever optins you use for netstat works too.
[16:58:53] <TJ-> scara: rpcbind installs rpcbind.socket which tells systemd to listen on that socket and when a connection comes in start rpcbind.service
[16:59:16] <scara> Whats wrong with netstat?
[16:59:19] <Psi-Jack> Yep. TJ- is correct.
[16:59:21] <jim> ss is the newer netstat, you can look into how to do netstat things using ss

[17:27:49] <jim> ok, I was gonna get to borgmatic (once I remembered its name...), but first, it sounds like I might be doing wrong or questionable things... could you comment on these: I made a repo, then backed up / with --one-file-system, then backed up /usr, then /var, and /home to separate archives but the main point being, all in the same repo
[17:28:30] <Descartes> and that e872 number is different from the text number because coreutils sha256sum doesn't understand the Windows file format ananke?

[17:29:18] <akik> Descartes: it shows the downloaded file doesn't match the precalculated checksum

[17:32:20] <Descartes> I was asuming that the e807 number for my downloaded exe tron script file would be the same as the text file number starting with d604, but you guys told me they're different because Linux coreutils sha256sum doesn't understand the Windows file format
[17:32:47] <akik> Descartes: it's a different tool with different output
[17:32:51] <jim> that's probably accurate
[17:33:06] <tirnanog> message digest functions don't care about file formats.
[17:33:11] <Psi-Jack> jim: I do that all the time, but, I only keep data, not stuff that can be reinstalled.

[21:27:40] <hexnewbie> sybariten: The remote part kind of ruins it, as it depends on the remote having access to your local keyboard, which is only true if you have X forwarding (which you can't have on by default, as it unsecure)
