[09:35:32] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> Hi there. The font problem I mentioned before, does not exist on my other computer, so I guess it might be some kind of a bloated system's fault.. I also tried to follow steps to "make SpaceVim a PHP IDE", and I can't get the "go to definition" function working. The error I get is this:
[09:35:32] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> 
[09:35:33] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> ```
[09:35:35] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> Error detected while processing function phpcomplete#JumpToDefinition[16]..phpcomplete#GetCurrentSymbolWithContext[39]..phpcomplete#GetCurrentNameSpace:

[09:35:40] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> 
[09:35:41] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> I use Neovim, and apparently this relates to the "popup" feature in recent Vim versions which has a different counterpart "floating windows" in Neovim. Yet, I didn't expect to stumble for such  along time when I was simply following the recommended way... Anyone has a solution to this problem?
[10:29:17] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> I tried to replace neovim with Vim 8.2, and the same thing doesn't work again, though this time for a different reason:

[10:30:57] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> It's probably phpcomplete doesn't get along with EasyMotion, but whatever it is... it's really annoying (( has anyone got lang#php with completion working?

[15:33:58] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> @crocodile2u_twitter this is a bug of `phpcomplete`
[15:34:30] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> use `lsp` layer and `lang#php` layer.

[21:33:00] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> Thank you, will try that!
[21:36:19] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> @wsdjeg , maybe you can give an advice on how to set it up? I am getting the same errors, with both vim & nvim
[21:39:58] *** Joins: Haudegen (~quassel@178.115.237.87.static.drei.at)
[22:07:02] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> Also I don't get it I can remove disable `phpcomplete`
[22:09:29] <SpaceVimBot> <crocodile2u_twitter> (I mean, without having to remove the whole `lang#php`)
