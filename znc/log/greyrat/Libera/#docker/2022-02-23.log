[02:24:00] <extor> I'm totally new to docker, just trying to associate it with concepts I'm already familiar with such as VMs and paravirtualized ones in particular. My first task will be to examine microg's docker build system and try to translate it into a more orthodox VM so I can examine the scripts and modify them.

[02:30:22] <akik> extor: docker is not a vm but you can make it behave like one
[02:39:58] <extor> So this docker image that microg have made is what exactly then, just a script? https://github.com/lineageos4microg/docker-lineage-cicd
[02:42:01] <rawtaz> extor: others here aer pretty sensitive about not considering a docker image the same thing as a VM's disk image, and a docker container the same thing as a VM, because they are not really the same thing. but at a very high conceptual level i'd argue it helps to think of it that way, but thats really just for the basic overview
[02:42:09] <extor> In their FAQ the answer to the question "Why Docker?" is that is a more convenient substitute for a VM
[02:42:17] <rawtaz> the Dockerfile you could call something of a script. it's what defines what the docker image should contain.
[02:42:38] <rawtaz> well it sure is more lightweight, for starters :)
[02:43:00] <extor> Ok but how do I go and find the meat inside the docker image
[02:43:23] <rawtaz> you want to look at the Dockerfile that the image was built from
[02:43:31] <extor> And then extract those scripts into an ubuntu VM with a regular bash shell which is my natural habitat
[02:43:43] <extor> Hrmm I see
[02:44:22] <extor> So this is the master blueprint? https://github.com/lineageos4microg/docker-lineage-cicd/blob/master/Dockerfile
[02:45:46] <extor> Hrmm I found a bashj script, that seems kind of more the blueprint than the make https://github.com/lineageos4microg/docker-lineage-cicd/blob/master/src/build.sh

[02:47:48] <rawtaz> yes its the master blueprint. note that it has a FROM at the top - this means it uses another image as the base of this one, adding the stuff in this one to that base
[02:47:54] <extor> I think docker is a worthwhile framework to master if it's even leaner than OpenVZ
[02:48:10] <rawtaz> really, you should just read some introductory article on the net, theres a ton of them that explains the basics
[02:48:26] <extor> If it looks lioke I could use docker for other tasks I might as well deep dive into it
[02:48:26] <rawtaz> its definitely worthwhile to learn to use docker
[02:48:33] <rawtaz> i consider it a basic skill today
[02:48:59] <rawtaz> and im always surprised when people ask me if i know how to use docker, like in the context of work etc. of fucking course i do, who doesnt, and if so why dont they? its like knowing how to use a shell
[02:49:12] <rawtaz> its simply something that is so common nowadays that it should be something you know at least a bit
[02:49:22] <extor> When they say it's a SaaS does that mean that it is dependent on "the cloud" in some way, as in dependent on docker.com's good graces in the form of storing the code and data?
[02:49:42] <rawtaz> well, otehr tasks you say. i currently am running the openstack client tool, and the aws client tool, using docker containers. instead of having them installed on my local machine
[02:49:42] <extor> Yeah it is common, I've been hearing about docker all over the place
[02:49:55] <rawtaz> because it would take hours to compile the darn thing. so i just run them through docker
[02:50:26] <rawtaz> i have no idea what they are talking about when they say SaaS etc. thats outside of docker context, thats probably about their services
[02:51:24] <rawtaz> regarding inspecting the contents of an image, see this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/53481010

[02:51:33] <rawtaz> another way is to simply sping up a contianer using that image
[02:51:34] <extor> Docker is 100% free right? Like github is free but when you use github you leech off the resources of microsoft? Hence using docker you leech off docker.com's hosting and CPU power?
[02:52:19] <rawtaz> are you seriously asking if when you use docker.com's hosting you are using their cpu power? :-)
[02:52:53] <rawtaz> if you so much as go to e.g. hub.docker.com, of course you will use some of their resources
[02:53:03] <extor> >You should not start a container just to see the image contents. For instance, you might want to look for malicious content, not run it. Use "create" instead of "run";
[02:53:06] <extor> Hahaha
[02:53:23] <rawtaz> eitehr way works. both have pros and cons
[02:53:40] <rawtaz> if i wanted to look in an image i'd just spin up a container using it
[02:53:42] <extor> Well I am justr curious how docker.com makes money to keep operating
[02:54:28] <rawtaz> yeah, they recently introduced a subscription where if you make a lot of requests you have to pay for it

[04:27:25] <Geo> As I'm not an apache person, I was hoping someone had encountered it or had docs to work through it
[04:28:12] <tabakhase> well you arent entirely "wrong" here - the "youll have to publish a port2 thing is certainly docker special - "further complicated by not talking about docker-apache to other-docker" what 99% of the google results would talk about :D
[04:29:44] <tabakhase> but if you are not an apache person... why apache? especially as ingress?  - using some "more docker native tooling" like Traefik or Caddy will be much_much_much more fun there - not only can they handle letsencrypt&co all by themself, but traefik can even talk to the docker api, discover container and route to them "based on labels you put on it" :P

[04:31:10] <tabakhase> you are more than welcome to use whatever after that (and if its apache for mod_php and needing mod_rewrite and htaccess or such, be it :D) - but for like "the front door" apache is a bit clumsy...

[14:10:00] <xcm> tabakhase: i am trying to have wordpress behind nginx, while also being able to reach the db. i manage to have other services behind nginx without configuring any networking (ie allowing everything to use "bridge"). without network_mode:bridge, wordpress can talk to the db, but with it, it breaks.
[14:10:31] <xcm> do you mean i should try to put everything in some other bridge network?
[14:12:52] <tabakhase> xcm "i manage to have other services behind nginx without configuring any networking" --- so, you hardcoded ips or what? - cause the default network does NOT have service-discovery - what also means your nginx kinda breaks if you recreate some appcontainer on a new IP uh... you dont want that
[14:13:43] <tabakhase> so you use a named-network to have docker resolve "names" of containers/services - yep
[14:14:00] <xcm> no, i haven't hardcoded anything. for all i know nginx-proxy has some black magic where if a service declares certain environment variables, it finds them
[14:14:38] <tabakhase> and like, "network_mode: "bridge" should kinda do literally nothing, its the default value to all i know :D
[14:15:36] <xcm> without it, the services in this .yml file  do not appear in the "bridge" network, but only in their own network that is auto generated (as you described earlier)
[14:17:36] <tabakhase> and hm, then the wording is "nginx-proxy hardcodes these ips" - maybe you dont do it manually, but its certainly a fixed ip it looks up via "docker inspect" -- where as "with names" youd have some "proxy_pass http://wp0/" 
[14:18:01] <xcm> yes, in nginx.conf IPs are present
[14:19:55] <tabakhase> and "to be in a network called bridge" its technically seriveses: thing: networks: - thingnet + networks: thingnet: name: bridge" or such, - but this may be a "magic name" that triggers some stuff, all a bit spooky :D -> https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#network_mode

[14:22:22] <tabakhase> so ye, i very much prefeer the method to "give the ingress its own network and tap in as needed" - doing this on the default bridge is quite cowboy-ish :D
[14:22:49] <Johnsen> i'm wondering if you want to use a hostname for 2 services in a docker-compose file, do you use the service name, or the container name
[14:23:11] <Johnsen> i see in your compose file you try to connect to wp0, but thats the service name, not the container name

[14:25:14] <tabakhase> "WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: wp0 + wp0: image mysql" you mean? - thats fine, or even perfect yea -- container names dont belong into compose, and hostnames you kinda shouldnt need ever in docker ;-)
[14:25:17] <Johnsen> ok i just tested and it seems to be service name
[14:25:18] <xcm> so i took the compose file from here https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/ (though they use `docker stack`. was this my hubris?)

[14:28:27] <tabakhase> xcm we all clear then? - keye is rly just that compose has black magic to automagically make a network if you dont specify any, as soon as you put own stuff in there that stops and you a named (so not default-bridge) network to resolve-by-name --- try declaring that all explicitly as networks: and see if nginx still finds it (may have to name:"bridge" force that then)
[14:28:28] <xcm> even if i use the "Name" from `docker network inspect bridge` (which is prefixed with the generated name), i still get "getaddrinfo failed:" from wordpress
[14:30:06] <tabakhase> (once you declare an explicit name in compose the prefixing stops, works for networks but also container_name or volumes for example^^)^

[14:31:39] <xcm> it's using the directory name which is fine. i hear you about it being better to put everything in an explicit network, but i still don't get why this doesn't work to be honest

[14:39:12] <Johnsen> that seems to explain your issue,  with network_mode: bridge in your comose file dockercompose does not seem to create a network at all, and it says in the url you paste that the default one only does IP addresses, no dns
[14:40:10] <tabakhase> [11:42:52] <tabakhase> [...] cause the default network does NOT have service-discovery - [...] so you use a named-network to have docker resolve "names" of containers/services

[14:41:47] <xcm> i guess it would be wise to switch everything to compose files and rework the network as you describe. until then, i need to work on this so i'll use `link`

[14:43:25] <tabakhase> and nothign "has to switch to compose files" or such -- if your nginx isnt, no problem, --- they both (docker-cli or docker-compose) call the exact same API´s anyhow so "you can do everything with either" pretty much :P
[14:44:05] <xcm> i'm already fighting with two ways of talking to docker, and the greater devil is wasting your time and mine
[14:47:35] <xcm> thank you both for the help. i'll try to parse what you described
[14:47:36] <Johnsen> why don't you just run wp + db in same network as nginx?  or wp+db in a separate network but let nginx connect to hostip:exposedport of wp

[14:53:04] <tabakhase> in itself they are all farily "easy" indeed - but docker has no learnign curve, just a series of steps so its absolutely normal to run into bit of a wall and bang around until it goes click and the last 8 hours suddenly make complete sense :D
[14:53:35] <Johnsen> hehe i know, i still don't get most of it
[14:54:52] <Johnsen> i now have another issue, but its not docker related, moved from influxdb1.8 to 2.1, 2.1 uses gigs of ram, while 1.8 was happy with 100

[15:20:21] <kydd> Hi! I have a docker-compose with an oauth2 server and a client. How do I configure docker so that the oauth2-server is both accessible from the host network, but also internally?
[15:21:14] <kydd> Previously I avoided this problem by setting the network-mode to "host", so that the URLs to the oauth2 server was the same. But for compatibility reasons, this approach does not work anymore
[15:23:09] <tabakhase> kydd which part doesnt work?
[15:23:41] <tabakhase> (all you need may be an alias to bend the domain over for "dockers view" - but at this point its purely guesstimating ;-) )

[15:25:05] <zamba> i have a script that i need to run every now and then (usually i'd do this through cron).. but i want to have this as a docker container.. what makes the most sense to do here?
[15:25:14] <zamba> start a docker container from cron?
[15:25:17] <kydd> tabakhase The app redirects the user to `localhost:9011/oauth2/` to sign in. This works fine, because the docker container is bound to that port. However, when the app tries to reach this endpoint itself, it will still refer to "localhost", which iwll not work
[15:25:17] <XATRIX> Hi, can you advice, i'm trying to build dlib on a cross-compile host, but make && make install use only one job. I have 32 cpu threads, but make use only one of
[15:25:18] <zamba> docker run --rm?
[15:25:26] <XATRIX>  Is there any restrictions inside the docker to use more threads ?
[15:25:31] <XATRIX> i did "make -j32 JOBS=32" - doesn't make any sens
[15:25:37] <XATRIX> it does even give me : "Looking for pthreads - Successfull" duing make configuration
[15:25:43] <XATRIX> can you advice a bit ?
[15:26:20] <tabakhase> zamba nothing "wrong" with having a cron do "docker run --rm" yea --- but also "runnign a extra cron-container" isnt unseen -- or even "using one container and a restart-policy instead" is patterns ive seen in the wild...
[15:26:23] <XATRIX> https://imgur.com/tUZYlIE.png
[15:26:38] <XATRIX> this is a RUN string 
[15:27:10] <zamba> tabakhase: what would you do in this case?
[15:28:50] <tabakhase> kydd k then yea kinda a combination of the two, and gonna get away from using localhost --- oath.devdomain in your hostsfile, oath.devdomain as network-alias on the container, and you can publish to 127.0.0.1 and then the WHOLE range up to 127.255.255.254 to "get a free port 80/443 if needed"

[23:47:05] <naquad> tabakhase, https://github.com/mageddo/dns-proxy-server yup, found one. thanks
[23:48:09] <naquad> deuxexmachina, i'm not sure what you mean by "launching" as docker run doesn't display any info related to network. if docker run would be printing out some summary like ip address aside from container id i wouldn't have that trouble
[23:48:50] <programmerq> you can always script reading that outputted container id and then use it in a docker inspect command to grab whatever you need.

[23:51:48] <naquad> programmerq, how will that differ from a dirty hack with docker dns proxy? :)
[23:52:01] <deuxexmachina> naquad: you can get IP per container, sure
[23:52:17] <programmerq> just pointing out that the reason that docker outputs the id is so you can take that and do stuff with it if you want. that's all
[23:52:30] <programmerq> but my original advice of publishing the port if you want to interact with a container stands.
[23:53:00] <naquad> after i'll inspect it i'll have to put it somewhere so basically and after the container stops (that i need to track somehow) i'll have to remove it
[23:53:26] <programmerq> docker is extremely opinionated and container ips are supposed to be completely irrelevant unless it's container-to-container traffic, and then the ips are still not used since docker has container-to-container name discovery.

[23:58:11] <tabakhase> oh and "if someone else starts it", docker has a "event stream" your thing can subscribe to^^
[23:59:02] <tabakhase> said, if you are the one starting - just add the port in the first place :P  (docker can do random ports wich then can be fetched with the "docker ports" command as well)
