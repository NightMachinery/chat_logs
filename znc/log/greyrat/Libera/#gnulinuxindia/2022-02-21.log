[11:48:17] <Zbnssn[m]> <NeoVoid[m]1> "my pc greets me good morning..." <- fixed it yet?

[11:53:13] <NeoVoid[m]> Zbnssn[m]: ohh yeah. I had the similar problem before. I remembered it can be solved by chowning / root and all its contents.
[11:59:12] <NeoVoid[m]> The error probably got created because i kept other hdd's system partition mounted on.
[11:59:58] <Zbnssn[m]> ohh you have to umount before shutdown
[12:02:23] <NeoVoid[m]> yes

[13:01:16] <NeoVoid[m]> iamak[m]: i cant see any videos
[13:01:41] <iamak[m]> Bruh 
[13:01:44] <iamak[m]> Which browser?
[13:01:51] <NeoVoid[m]> any browser
[13:01:58] <iamak[m]> Check if it's throwing any errors in console
[13:02:13] <NeoVoid[m]> may be i messed up my firewall again
[13:02:39] <iamak[m]> Check once after stopping firewall
[13:02:49] <NeoVoid[m]> but it works on old un-updated artix installation
[13:03:10] <NeoVoid[m]> with old version of brave firefox and librewold and stuffs
[13:03:16] <NeoVoid[m]> s/librewold/librewolf/
[13:03:27] <NeoVoid[m]> iamak[m]: yeah
[13:03:38] <iamak[m]> It works for me on updated, unmodified librewolf

[13:03:56] <NeoVoid[m]> i cant play odysee either
[13:04:19] <iamak[m]> Idk what that is lol
[13:04:41] <telegram_1372692> iamak[m]: Video streaming site
[13:04:46] <telegram_1372692> I think
[13:05:20] <iamak[m]> Hmm
[13:13:48] <NeoVoid[m]> <iamak[m]> "Idk what that is lol" <- odysee.com
[13:16:39] <iamak[m]> So basically FOSS YT?
[13:17:53] <iamak[m]> How is it different from PeerTube?
[13:26:58] <NeoVoid[m]> <iamak[m]> "How is it different from..." <- bruh
[13:27:31] <iamak[m]> Sorry I haven't used either
[13:27:32] <iamak[m]> xD
[13:27:33] <NeoVoid[m]> are you kidding me
[13:27:33] <NeoVoid[m]> u dont know anything about odysee?
[13:27:41] <iamak[m]> No
[13:27:42] <Klisper[m]> Hello guys
[13:28:15] <iamak[m]> I don't use even YT (through frontends and all)
[13:28:17] <NeoVoid[m]> <iamak[m]> "How is it different from..." <- its uses its own protocol
[13:28:17] <NeoVoid[m]> lbry
[13:28:38] <NeoVoid[m]> remember lbry.com?
[13:29:13] <NeoVoid[m]> odysee is better frontend for lbry
[13:29:38] <NeoVoid[m]> i think they use blockchain
[13:31:09] <iamak[m]> NeoVoid[m]: Nope xD
[13:31:19] <iamak[m]> But I think I got the gist

[14:15:13] <iamak[m]> Privacy Redirect seems like a nice addon in FF
[14:28:02] <AryaK[m]> yes
[14:28:03] <AryaK[m]> it is
[14:29:08] <Tor[m]> <iamak[m]> "Privacy Redirect seems like a..." <- Does it really work tho
[14:29:17] <iamak[m]> Yes
[14:29:23] <Tor[m]> Using linux makes you stand out and with ublock and other add ons
[14:29:43] <Tor[m]> Makes us stand out like a sore thumb
[14:31:24] <iamak[m]> I don't think websites can detect addons
[14:31:46] <iamak[m]> And I don't think this particular addon makes any changes to a webpage or scope or etc
[14:32:19] <iamak[m]> Afaik it checks for changes to the webpage address, if the address belongs to a blacklisted website, redirects it to the FOSS frontend
[14:33:23] <Tor[m]> iamak[m]: That's nice i will try it later 
[14:33:23] <Tor[m]> Also me uses browser with js disabled 
[14:34:25] <iamak[m]> Js disabled will probably be more of an issue if you want to blend in
[14:35:15] <Tor[m]> The reason is my laptop is old it takes time to load js and bloat

[15:10:54] <iamak[m]> <Lolsomeone[m]> "image.jpeg" <- IITK seems down
[15:10:57] <iamak[m]> Other 2 are working for me
[15:11:10] <iamak[m]> (I pinged them. Idk if there is other way to verify if they work)
[15:15:08] <Lolsomeone[m]> <Tor[m]> "Ran puppylinux on love usb but..." <- Bro i guess there's is some sort of hardware failure prolly  due to corruption in your hdd
[15:19:15] <Aaron[m]1> <Tor[m]> "Main problem windows 7" <- I know it is ssl problem with letsencrypt certificate

[16:53:40] <AryaK[m]> wait
[16:53:46] <AryaK[m]> that computer can literally run arch lol
[16:54:34] <AryaK[m]> what happened to irc-open-up
[16:59:25] <Aaron[m]1> <JB[m]> "Suggest a distro for old laptop" <- I went for xubuntu
[16:59:33] <Aaron[m]1> Nevet regretted
[16:59:59] <JB[m]> <AryaK[m]> "what happened to irc-open-up" <- Its down...
[16:59:59] <JB[m]> I'll resurrect it soon
[17:02:00] <JB[m]> Aaron[m]1: Tested manjaro xfce , works fine... Had some issues with mousepad like single tap select, maybe fixable in settings menu didn't had time
[17:02:26] <JB[m]> Aaron[m]1: Ill check this one tonight
[17:07:28] <pystardust> JB[m]: single tap select is off by default. You could either use libinput cli or look for some gui (should be there in setting ig)
[17:10:05] <JB[m]> pystardust: ok I'll check
[17:26:38] <sla[m]12> <JB[m]> "Suggest a distro for old laptop" <- artix
[17:27:19] <sla[m]12> or anything, it can run any distro
[17:34:26] <Tor[m]> <iamak[m]> "Try some lightweight distro?" <- Cannot (yet ) i will miht install puppylinux 
[17:35:12] <Tor[m]> Anyother suggestion
[17:39:38] <iamak[m]> Depending upon how you configure it, Arch can be very minimal
[17:39:43] <iamak[m]> ðŸ’€
[18:01:23] <Lolsomeone[m]> <JB[m]> "Suggest a distro for old laptop" <- Manjaro minimalist
[18:43:00] <iamak[m]> Isn't Arch even more minimal than Manjaro?
[18:54:42] <smud[m]> Distros aren't minimal or bloated, they're all the same. It's what you install on it that makes it minimal
[18:58:08] <smud[m]> ...Unless it's the extreme case like using busybox or something
[19:00:45] <dakship[m]> <smud[m]> "Distros aren't minimal or..." <- but that is to distros which are alike, no?
[19:00:45] <dakship[m]> In the case of arch and manjaro, one comes with pretty much the core and the other comes with gui and other utilities
[19:01:31] <smud[m]> But wouldn't you end up installing most of those utilities anyway?
[19:01:57] <smud[m]> It's not like everyone uses arch with the tty

[19:02:14] <Klisper[m]> me who uses gentoo and doesnt really care about bloat
[19:03:42] <dakship[m]> smud[m]: Some but not many at least for me
[19:03:42] <dakship[m]> I guess if you want a "comfy" (what I mean is  a full DE with other utilities like a file manager) experience with arch you may get manjaro
[19:04:43] <dakship[m]> smud[m]: Some use window managers too tho
[19:04:43] <dakship[m]> thought I think there are WM editions for manjaro
[19:04:55] <dakship[m]> s/thought/but/
[19:07:29] <smud[m]> Yeah
[19:07:47] <smud[m]> You can always make a distro lighter by uninstalling stuff you don't use
[19:11:34] <dakship[m]> smud[m]: I wouldn't really do that if I could just start with a minimal install and install things I need on the way
[19:11:34] <dakship[m]> but true
