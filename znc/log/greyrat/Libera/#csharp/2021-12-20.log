[05:14:08] <sysRPL> would native aot actually be useful?
[05:14:26] <sysRPL> i am having a hard time deciding if it would be
[05:15:10] <moose> What do you think "native AOT" is?
[05:15:46] *** Quits: DarkSeid (uid394293@id-394293.helmsley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[05:17:39] <moose> Because really I think it would be quite useful for many things. One big thing is the potential for embedded development. Another is better cross platform support to things like phones or TVs.
[05:18:00] <moose> I don't see how reflection would be done though and so things like EF would suffer. Good thing I don't use that though :)
[05:18:11] <Nasp> Are you asking what it is or what we think it is
[05:18:20] <moose> Nasp: What sysRPL specifically thinks it is.
[05:18:23] *** Joins: phrosty (~phrosty@c-73-225-175-19.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[05:18:28] <moose> Hence why I asked "what do you think native AOT is"?
[05:18:33] <Nasp> Also refleciton shouldn't be an issue
[05:18:39] <Nasp> That's why they made source generators
[05:18:49] <moose> Nasp: I think it depends on what you think native AOT is then :)
[05:18:57] <sysRPL> i know what native aot is ... i'm just not sure if it is useful
[05:19:09] <moose> sysRPL: I ask not because I think you're an idiot/don't know, but because there's varying definitions.
[05:19:15] <bpmedley> sysRPL : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/webassembly?view=aspnetcore-6.0#ahead-of-time-aot-compilation <-- Is this the same feature you're speaking about?
[05:19:21] <moose> There isn't really a standard definition of what native AOT is.
[05:19:45] <sysRPL> this is what i am referring -> https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/NativeAOT/samples/NativeLibrary

[05:20:29] <_genuser_> hola migos
[05:20:31] <moose> Just interoperability to call C# libs?
[05:20:32] <bpmedley> sysRPL : Call Native AOT from C?
[05:20:41] <sysRPL> that is, compiling a c# project as either a static lib (.a on unix .lib on windows) or a shred lib (.so on linux .dll on windows)
[05:20:57] <sysRPL> * shared
[05:21:09] <sysRPL> bpmedley: sure or other languages
[05:21:24] <bpmedley> sysRPL : Think of the matlab use cases and other environments without c#!!
[05:21:35] <sysRPL> i'm not sure why i might want to call c# code
[05:21:42] <moose> Heh, I've never tried calling LoadLibrary against a C# dll. Anyone here tried it?
[05:22:11] <Nasp> Not sure i get what i need native AOT for
[05:22:28] <sysRPL> Nasp: hey, that's my position
[05:22:34] <moose> Nasp: sysRPL: Alright so what if there's a cool library out there that you want to use but you have an existing C++ code base?
[05:22:42] <bpmedley> Nasp : If I'm understanding correctly, the generated library would be self sufficient and not need any sdk or runtime installed.
[05:22:43] <moose> And it's a CLS compliant C# lib.
[05:22:45] <Nasp> moose:  I wouldnt
[05:22:53] <moose> Nasp: OK then maybe you don't need it. But other people have these issues.
[05:23:09] <moose> Also it's going to be considerably more performant in terms of instruction caching to have native AOT.
[05:23:14] <Nasp> Can't you still just invoke the dll like you've always bee nable to
[05:23:18] <bomb> I ended up watching the whole fucking video, I hope your happy now moose
[05:23:28] <moose> I don't know, honestly. That's why I asked about LoadLibrary haha
[05:23:34] <moose> I may just try it for fun now.
[05:23:51] <_genuser_> did you just rickroll him.
[05:24:00] <_genuser_> and he ended up watching the whole song....
[05:24:08] <bomb> no it was a 20 minutes of some car racing shit
[05:24:10] <moose> It's not a song _genuser_
[05:24:14] <sysRPL> i mean, if i want to use a dotnet assembly or feature, i'd just write a dotnet program
[05:24:22] <moose> It's a dude who does sim drift racing and seeing if he can do it for real in a drift car on the track. He succeeded, yes.
[05:24:24] <_genuser_> oh geez, now I"m gonna be singing "never gonna give you up" all day long.
[05:24:35] <bpmedley> Nasp : However, what about calling from a C or C++ app?
[05:24:45] <sysRPL> i can't see myself wanting anything from dotnet if i wasn't using dotnet
[05:24:52] <moose> sysRPL: So you would rewrite a massive C++ project in C# instead of just importing a lib?
[05:25:04] <moose> Seems like a waste of time/money in most corporate environments, where this will likely apply to.
[05:25:13] <sysRPL> moose: no, i'd just stay using that massive c++ project
[05:25:30] <sysRPL> moose: why would i need c# inside a massive c++ project?
[05:25:38] <moose> sysRPL: There are plenty of libs done only in C#
[05:26:03] <sysRPL> please provide an example?
[05:26:20] <sysRPL> and example where i might want it inside my massive c++ project
[05:26:22] <bomb> neva gona giv neva gona giv
[05:26:28] <moose> I am not going to invent use cases for you, sysRPL
[05:26:31] <bomb> giv u up
[05:26:34] <sysRPL> that's the p;oint
[05:26:35] <moose> If you don't ever think you will encounter that situation, so be it
[05:26:39] <sysRPL> i don't see a use case
[05:26:41] <bomb> we know each other
[05:26:44] <bomb> fo so lon
[05:27:13] <sysRPL> i mean in theory is sounds good, but i just can't see a good use case
[05:27:25] <bpmedley> sysRPL : What if a C or C++ project existed with lots of sloc and you wanted to gradually transition development to C#?
[05:27:58] <moose> sysRPL: There are a lot of image processing libs in C#
[05:28:00] <bomb> you sign the contract for C++ development but hired cheaper C# developers?
[05:28:17] <sysRPL> okay, in that case i would probably just write some c# parts for it and use ipc
[05:28:37] <bomb> C# makes a good scripting language IMO
[05:28:48] <moose> Accord .NET is pretty cool and there's nothing really equivalent in C or C++
[05:28:55] <moose> You can get the same functionality, but it's much more complex
[05:28:58] <sysRPL> bomb: there is one problem with that
[05:29:15] <moose> bomb: Yeah I like the idea of doing DLLs in C# for plugins or whatever
[05:29:19] <sysRPL> bomb: how do you prevent c# `scripts` from doing things they aren't allowed to do
[05:29:33] <bomb> hmm it's going to be user-submitted scripts?
[05:29:35] <moose> sysRPL: That applies to literally every scripting language or language in general.
[05:29:46] <bomb> https://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/sandbox/
[05:29:50] <moose> sysRPL: Perhaps you have official modules that people can download for your app that add functionality but not everyone needs them
[05:30:04] <moose> So in order to reduce dependencies and code size, you just ship what they want
[05:30:06] <sysRPL> moose: it doesn't apply to to a lot of javascript
[05:30:13] <bomb> didn't read the page, maybe it's something totally diff
[05:30:15] <moose> sysRPL: You are hilarious
[05:30:19] <moose> sysRPL: How does it not apply to JS?
[05:30:53] <moose> Chromium that was deployed to TVs and tons of headless devices was vulnerable to RCE via JS.
[05:31:50] <sysRPL> ecmascript doesn't have access to files or folders on your pc, it doesn't have access to sockets, it doesn't have access to multiple threads
[05:31:54] <moose> Anything that is untrusted and supplied input has serious problems, so it's a flaw to allow arbitrary code to run on a service.
[05:31:57] <Nasp> Mixing C# and c++ sounds like you are trying to solve one problem by creating two new ones
[05:32:05] <moose> sysRPL: It doesn't need to.
[05:32:09] <sysRPL> any by ecmascript, i mean ecmascript detatached from your browser
[05:32:24] <moose> Nasp: What if they're trying to transition out of a C++ codebase by rewriting pieces instead of the entire thing at once?
[05:32:35] <sysRPL> ipc
[05:32:35] <moose> I worked on a large migration like that once and it was quite a nightmare. It cost millions of dollars.
[05:32:51] <moose> We could've done it over time, in stages, and it would've been great if we had been able to pull pieces out into C#
[05:33:37] <moose> sysRPL: I don't see a use case for ecmascript outside of the browser :)
[05:33:54] <moose> JavaScript/ECMAScript is basically the devil to me
[05:33:58] <sysRPL> moose: i used it for adding scripting to my pinball simulator
[05:34:09] <moose> sysRPL: Well I don't have a pinball simulator, so it's basically pointless if it exists.
[05:34:17] <moose> See the issue here?
[05:34:27] <moose> This is basically your argument for no native AOT :)
[05:34:48] <sysRPL> moose: no. if you want to add scripting to your program, then ecmascript is a nice option
[05:35:01] <moose> I think I'd prefer C# or Lua or even C.
[05:35:06] <moose> Especially before ECMAScript.
[05:36:29] <sysRPL> and how do you stop file and folder access in a c# script?
[05:38:01] <moose> Whitelist approach to stuff you want to allow.
[05:38:11] <moose> You know, just like everything else.
[05:38:36] <sysRPL> so how do you whitelist methods or classes in c#?
[05:38:54] <moose> There's a lot of ways.
[05:39:16] <sysRPL> please give me an example way
[05:39:22] <moose> You are arguing by just asking exhaustive questions
[05:39:58] <bomb> I didn't read the convo, but both moose and sysRPL are wrong.
[05:40:02] <sysRPL> no, you are contending that c# is a good scripting lanuage, and i say it doesn't have a way to stop people from doing things in scripts they shouldn't be alllowed to do
[05:40:18] <sysRPL> and your explanation is "<moose> You know, just like everything else"
[05:40:34] <moose> Now you're quoting out of context.
[05:40:50] <moose> So how is this going to be productive if you can't be honest with your own argument even?
[05:41:12] <moose> You think I said C# is a good scripting language but the reality is that I said I'd prefer C#, Lua, or even C over ECMAScript.
[05:41:18] <sysRPL> okay, please tell me how to `whitelist` c# from reading or writing to your filesystem?
[05:41:38] <moose> I said that C# as a scripting language will experience the same issues as any type of executable code from an untrusted source.
[05:43:15] <sysRPL> an ecmascript in my application isn't going to have access to my file system, unlike c#, so they are not the same problems
[05:43:16] <moose> sysRPL: So again this is a basic Google. If you wanted to compile C# scripts directly from source in a folder, you could disable binding redirects and remote references and then whitelist the referenced assemblies in your CompilerParameters object.
[05:44:11] <moose> You could then even load those into a separate app domain and sandbox it even more by revoking all privileges and redirecting all assembly resolution via the AssemblyResolve event.
[05:45:08] <sysRPL> so you want to ban System.Runtime.dll ?
[05:45:59] <moose> You can also redefine anything basically in ECMASCript, so if anything in your code trusts anything from any portion of ECMASCript such as a trusted script then an untrusted script can redefine/mess with it and trigger vulnerabilities.
[05:47:17] <sysRPL> wait, did you mean to secure c# you should disable System.Runtime.dll?
[05:47:29] <moose> sysRPL: Where did I say that all?
[05:47:31] <moose> at all
[05:47:53] <sysRPL> well all the basic file and folder operations are in System.Runtime.dll
[05:48:11] <moose> rofl

[06:07:43] <moose> bomb: What about the simplest solution of all. "We just are"
[06:07:59] <moose> No evolution, no past even, just the current slice that has all of the things we think happened within it. Self contained. It's like a docker image.
[06:08:45] <sysRPL> but i deal with a lot of simplistic religious people all the time. and the idea of god comforts them because it provides them with simple solutions to problems like why are we here and what happens after we die
[06:08:58] <moose> And if there's any question of "How did the mind or universe form?!" it's tossed out quite easily because it never was. The concept is given to you as part of your state.

[08:41:27] <tsujp> do you lot prefer input validation in ASP.NET API-only in the controller or client/model?
[08:41:29] *** Quits: night_wulfe (~wulfe@cpe-174-103-156-213.cinci.res.rr.com) (Quit: And I'm out.)
[08:41:57] <moose> I use the built-in model validation stuff in the model
[08:42:34] <moose> But for complex security related validation, like ensuring characters are only in a whitelist, I add that in the controller directly with helper functions.
[08:42:48] <moose> My answer: controller and model
[08:43:58] <MatthiasVance> I wonder what you mean by client/model
[08:44:01] <MatthiasVance> Because model exists on both
[08:44:22] <moose> Maybe both?
[08:46:13] <tsujp> Ah I should clarify, in this case it's an API that doesn't map any model data we own, but rather calls another API (not ours) and returns data from that one
[08:46:32] <tsujp> Basically this shim api calls another 3rd party api
[08:47:01] <tsujp> I feel like validation would go in the controller for simple things like: numeric input, or alphabetic input etc
[08:47:11] <MatthiasVance> Instead of?
[08:47:23] <MatthiasVance> The consumer of your API?
[08:47:23] <tsujp> but for things that require also calling the 3rd party api that should be validated in the "client" (the thing calling the 3rd party api) right?
[08:47:53] <MatthiasVance> So the client is your "API library thing", then yes
[08:48:00] <MatthiasVance> At the lowest point, ensure data is valid
[08:48:23] <tsujp> Okay so imagine we have a method that accepts a user numeric user ID, the controller validates it's numeric but we also want to validate that it exists (not the best example I know) so validating it exists goes in the client, and also in the client is where we query that 3rd party api for details on it
[08:48:43] <tsujp> i realise in this case querying it and getting the details is the same but conceptually
[08:51:17] <MatthiasVance> "Has to exist" sounds like application logic
[08:51:22] <MatthiasVance> Like something you'd usually query the DB for
[08:51:48] <MatthiasVance> Then again it all depends :D
[09:02:33] <tsujp> Right I mean if this was our own model data I could query the DB
[09:02:40] <tsujp> but the "DB" in this case is the backing 3rd party API
[09:05:05] <pandem> i think your validation makes sense

[12:27:57] <MaNa2k> what a boring day to be working at today
[12:29:02] <MatthiasVance> Why?
[12:32:27] <MichaelLong> I'm already on vacation :)
[12:39:39] <MatthiasVance> :D
[12:39:50] <MatthiasVance> This is the first year I am not taking any around christmas / new year
[12:40:07] <MichaelLong> because it is your new job?
[12:40:33] <MatthiasVance> Yes and no. I can take vacation but I rather take them later for a better balance
[12:40:50] <MatthiasVance> And all the bank holidays are on weekends
[12:40:57] <MatthiasVance> So it would cost more days as well :D
[12:41:53] <MichaelLong> I use the the time around christmas to reduce my accumulated amount of vacation days
[12:42:16] <MatthiasVance> Not to get some rest? :D
[12:42:47] <MichaelLong> no, focusing on personal stuff
[12:44:54] <MichaelLong> I perceive the last two years as less stressful in regard of workload. the increased working from home situation is also  benefitial for me (I know that's not for everyone)
[12:46:17] <MatthiasVance> No I mean you made it sound like the primary reason was to "get rid of" vacation days :D
[12:46:53] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, because little stuff to do these days
[12:47:02] <MichaelLong> anyways, how is the lockdown going?
[12:47:12] <MaNa2k> MichaelLong, so your spending your vacation on irc ?
[12:47:43] <_genuser_> MichaelLong's on vacation?
[12:47:55] <MichaelLong> MaNa2k, yes approx. the same amount when not on vacation
[12:48:26] <MaNa2k> i would really like to pick up on android app developement again.
[12:48:36] <MaNa2k> ...when my vacation startst next week
[12:48:36] <_genuser_> MaNa2k you're an android dev?
[12:48:40] <MaNa2k> no
[12:48:43] <MaNa2k> im a c# dev
[12:48:51] <MaNa2k> but want to make this app for my self on android
[12:48:52] <MichaelLong> MaNa2k, then why not doing it if there's little to do? Invest into yourself
[12:49:10] <MaNa2k> MichaelLong, cant use work time for my own personal stuff
[12:49:12] <_genuser_> MaNa2k you said "again", sounded as if you've done some android dev.
[12:49:22] <_genuser_> MaNa2k so you haven't done any android dev before?
[12:49:27] <_genuser_> will this be a new project?
[12:49:38] <MichaelLong> MaNa2k, ok true, but does your company has some procedure for self education?
[12:49:58] <MaNa2k> _genuser_, ah, actually i stated learning a little last summer, and it all came to a sudden stop, so i would like to pickup from there again
[12:50:11] <MaNa2k> *i was learning
[12:50:35] <_genuser_> MaNa2k I see. I have done decent amount of android dev. kinda started looking cleaner with MVVM (imo much better than c# version of MVVM)
[12:50:41] <MaNa2k> MichaelLong, none that dosnt benifit them self
[12:50:49] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: Lockdown is not much different
[12:51:09] <_genuser_> MaNa2k I have a c# app for the desktop that I use almost daily, and I figured I should have a mobile version of it. So the latest project was coding up a mobile version of it. Which is also use on a regular basis.
[12:51:28] <_genuser_> but been ignoring it a little lately, because it needs some more features.
[12:51:34] <MaNa2k> mhm
[12:51:58] <_genuser_> also was fun coding the desktop side in c# with those concerns, and mobile side in java with mobile concerns.
[12:52:38] <MaNa2k> _genuser_, well i stated on kotlin after i learned google is going that direction
[12:52:42] <MaNa2k> *started
[12:53:06] <_genuser_> MaNa2k hehe, I started kotlin too but kinda gave up on learning that since the syntax and such were a little too different.
[12:53:22] <MaNa2k> mhm
[12:53:29] <MaNa2k> yea it is kind of wired
[12:53:33] <MaNa2k> *wierd
[12:53:39] <_genuser_> MaNa2k but I started writing the code in java and then right-clicking and selecting convert to kotlin. That also gives you a good idea on how the kotlin code would look like. But also helps learn a little better, imo.
[12:54:00] <_genuser_> it's not structured learning, tho.
[12:54:00] <MaNa2k> ah cool

[12:55:48] <MaNa2k> the app i want to make already exists on google play, but im still gonna make it for learning different stuff
[12:56:23] <_genuser_> right. the first one I wrote was a todo list app. I saw an app on someone's phone and modeled mine after that UI.
[12:56:40] <MaNa2k> cool
[12:56:42] <_genuser_> it was a good idea to have a ui/ux in view and then trying to code to that.
[12:57:53] <MaNa2k> im gonna make a reciept saver app. Mostly for keeping track of warranty left on stuff
[12:58:17] <MaNa2k> so the app will allow a user to take picture and save the app, probably on a server somewhere
[12:58:20] <_genuser_> so you scan the receipt and keep a copy ?
[12:58:28] <MaNa2k> yes
[12:58:36] <MaNa2k> and register som tags and stuff
[12:58:37] <_genuser_> hmm, that's a good idea. never occurred to me. at least not recently.
[12:59:11] <_genuser_> I guess I did use to have an idea like that. But I think it was more along the lines of something I had heard, scan everything, and the receipt is associated with how much you spend on what items monthly.
[12:59:16] <MaNa2k> tags like, store name, expiry date, buy date, etc
[12:59:42] <_genuser_> right.
[12:59:51] <MaNa2k> then you can search for spesific reciepts
[13:00:05] <_genuser_> so you use the backend like azure blob storage or something
[13:00:10] <MaNa2k> maybe also add an alarm or something for recipts that are about to exipre
[13:00:30] <_genuser_> then once the user reached 100 receipts, you're like oh mr. user, you should subscribe to be able to store more than 100 receipts.
[13:00:38] <MaNa2k> havent decieded on that part yet. it will probably be a c# back-end i guess
[13:00:42] <_genuser_> 100 - 200 is only 5.99/mo
[13:00:56] <_genuser_> 201 - 500 is only 7.99/mo
[13:00:58] <_genuser_> lol
[13:01:21] <_genuser_> then you get a bunch of instagram influencers to promotes this app.
[13:02:02] <_genuser_> 10,000 users paying 5.99/mo is like 59,900 per mo.
[13:02:16] <_genuser_> heh.

[13:53:40] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, we cant do Dell, because i think we have some wiered contract with lenovo
[13:53:49] <MaNa2k> so everything has to be lenovo
[13:53:53] <MaNa2k> even the monitors
[13:54:03] <pandem> i should get a new dell

[13:54:14] <pandem> i think the it department ordered it but havent heard anything
[13:54:26] <pandem> better dell than mac
[13:54:33] <pandem> especially cause i need to do framework sometimes
[13:55:18] <MatthiasVance> Parallels?
[13:56:37] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, ops sorry, i though i had written, "if someone could recomend med a good tinkpad laptop...."

[13:57:23] <MichaelLong> MaNa2k, X1 Extreme, probably? I was eying on a 14s (AMD-based) but it has not thunderbold
[13:57:40] <MichaelLong> we're also buying a lot of P1 thindpads
[13:57:45] <MaNa2k> mhm, thunderbolt it a must for me

[13:57:54] <MichaelLong> but yeah clunky bigger devices
[13:57:54] <MatthiasVance> Not the consumer ones
[13:58:11] <MichaelLong> specs alone doesn't cut it.
[13:58:20] <MaNa2k> i also need a numbpad
[13:58:26] <MaNa2k> dont htink the x1 has that
[13:58:26] <MichaelLong> MaNa2k, what??!
[13:58:31] <MaNa2k> numpad

[13:58:51] <MatthiasVance> WHAT
[13:58:54] <MatthiasVance> Buy an external one
[13:58:56] <MichaelLong> ok but especially that X1 might have it
[13:59:07] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, then i have to drag that shit around all the time
[13:59:09] <MaNa2k> and plug it inn
[13:59:17] <MatthiasVance> Hm right
[13:59:19] <MatthiasVance> But ergonomics?
[13:59:22] <MaNa2k> i write numbers waster on numpad
[13:59:24] <MatthiasVance> Wait!
[13:59:27] <MaNa2k> actually without looking
[13:59:33] <MatthiasVance> Don't get one with a numpad, but one where you can reuse keys as numpad
[13:59:35] <MichaelLong> MaNa2k, you don't use dockingstations?
[13:59:55] <MaNa2k> MichaelLong, yes i do
[14:00:11] <MaNa2k> then i have a numpad on my external keyboard
[14:00:20] <MaNa2k> but when im not on dock, i would still prefer a numpad
[14:00:23] <MichaelLong> then why do you need that shitty numpad on the device itself. you probably want to buy a nice keyboard anyways?
[14:00:37] <MichaelLong> but how often is that?
[14:00:58] <MichaelLong> that should not the main differentiator to buy a laptop

[17:06:15] <MaNa2k> niston, if you autogenerated it, then its probably somewhere in your config file
[17:06:35] <SKull> MaNa2k: the query string? no. the connection string: probably
[17:07:07] <MaNa2k> ah right, though you meant the connstr
[17:07:30] *** Joins: Jong (~Jong@163.114.132.6)
[17:07:58] <SKull> i love connection strings. they usually have a clear text password in it, and no one is bothered by it.
[17:08:05] <MaNa2k> if you do it in ssms, then you can see the view\query
[17:08:19] <MaNa2k> SKull, lol
[17:08:38] <SKull> and usually, it's the complete DB admin account in that file
[17:08:41] <MaNa2k> SKull, and people just add their connstring to config file and hoping its a safe place
[17:08:56] <SKull> MaNa2k: it is safe. to read.

[17:10:52] <MaNa2k> btw, whats up with peoples using google sheets as their db for their apps ?
[17:11:18] <SKull> MaNa2k: lazyness? stupidity? incompetence? there's no way to tell.
[17:11:27] <niston> yea no idea
[17:11:32] <MaNa2k> lol
[17:11:38] <MaNa2k> https://blog.coupler.io/how-to-use-google-sheets-as-database/
[17:12:01] <SKull> MaNa2k: i don't care about the 'how', i care about the 'why in the everloving fuck!'
[17:12:17] <SKull> niston: just search your code for 'DataAdapter', there has to be one of those i think
[17:13:16] <SKull> although, putting all your stuff into a google spreadsheet is a safe way to make sure that you don't have any data inciting violence or being racist. google scans its cloud content for that
[17:15:16] <niston> there's a tableadapter and it has a connection property. no SqlCommmand or similar on that one tho.
[17:17:19] <SKull> niston: does the connection have a command property?
[17:17:47] <SKull> niston: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection?view=sqlclient-dotnet-standard-4.0
[17:17:59] <niston> it doesn't
[17:18:15] <SKull> niston: i know it's the .net core one, but if i recall correctly, the old one used in *Adapter had that too
[17:18:32] <niston> it has a CreateCommand() function but no Command property
[17:18:55] <SKull> niston: just run that, that will give you an SqlCommand object that contains the query string
[17:20:28] <SKull> niston: but if you want to make changes to said string, that aproach won't work
[17:20:35] <niston> ok
[17:20:50] <niston> tableadapter.Connection.CreateCommand().CommandText is an empty string
[17:21:12] <SKull> niston: well, did you make changes in the dataset?
[17:21:15] <niston> no need to change it, I just want to read it
[17:21:17] <niston> changes?
[17:21:28] <niston> no changes, only data retrieval
[17:21:56] <niston> its just a select, not update/insert/delete
[17:23:11] <SKull> niston: if said SqlCommand object has a .Prepare() method, run that first. maybe that generates the string
[17:23:57] <SKull> .Prepare() "Creates a prepared version of the command on an instance of SQL Server."
[17:24:06] <SKull> whatever 'prepared' means in this scenario
[17:24:18] <niston> testing now
[17:25:01] <niston> nope.
[17:26:00] <SKull> niston: try Executing the command, maybe that will fill it o.O
[17:26:35] <niston> nope.
[17:26:43] <niston> oh well.
[17:27:08] <SKull> niston: see, this is why the last time i've worked with DataSet and automated DataAdapter crap was back in 2008 ^^
[17:28:54] <SKull> niston: also, it might help if you actually post some code
[17:29:00] <SKull> niston: maybe someone else has ideas
[17:29:09] <niston> well its not that important

[17:45:46] <niston> your code is automatically protected by copyright in Switzerland

[17:47:08] <SKull> niston: could be? we don't tax patent earnings. google makes a lot of earnings that way.
[17:47:30] <moose> Software only got copyright protection in 1983 in the equivalency of literary works

[17:47:50] <SKull> moose: and with a lot of lobbying from bill gates i assume
[17:47:52] <niston> I knew I remember that from somewhere
[17:48:33] <moose> SKull: Apple sued Franklin Computer because they reused a prepackaged BIOS from Apple II to make their machine compatible with the OS
[17:48:52] <niston> ah but SKull, doesn't that just mean that they can patent in other countries and we still won't tax them on the earnings ?

[17:51:02] <moose> Yep.
[17:51:12] <moose> But basically the 1983 ruling only applied to object code, not source code
[17:51:36] <niston> wait, so only your object code gains automatic protection ?
[17:52:35] <moose> From the 1983 ruling, yes. Source code was protected by a 1974 ruling
[17:52:42] <niston> ah.
[17:52:48] <moose> Well, 1974 case ruled in 1980
[17:52:56] <niston> "neuland" :D
[17:53:11] <moose> And that one was because of Apple and Microsoft fighting

[17:53:40] <niston> ah, Borland. Distinct memories of yellow text on blue background.
[17:53:56] <moose> Borland tried to say that they maintained rights to some object code or something if their compiler made it
[17:55:23] <moose> So basically Borland created a compiler with a certain look and feel and Lotus got mad. Apple got mad at Microsoft for the definition of a copy.

[17:58:09] <moose> It lets you connect to a database, execute a stored procedure, and get a result set back.
[17:58:22] <moose> You use SqlCommand and SqlParameter to do the things with the sproc.

[18:24:13] <moose> You could probably make something in a couple of days that pulls the sprocs, figures out their result sets, generates C# models for simple types, and implements methods that calls them.
[18:24:34] <moose> Then you could just shove them all into one static class for now.
[18:24:38] <kobo> moose, yeah and people down the line will swear by my tool that I created
[18:24:46] <moose> Yes, you'll be a god.

[18:27:16] <moose> It was indeed just a playbook with step by step instructions for a button masher.
[18:27:34] <moose> I assumed they had meant like... batch/bash/C# scripts.
[18:29:27] <moose> kobo: But here's what you can do, depending on how much you give a crap. Write your tool, automate the entire thing, and then release sprocs every couple of days. Make commits daily with a couple. That's at least a month of coasting.
[18:30:28] <kobo> Well this tool seems to exist: https://github.com/ErikEJ/EFCorePowerTools/wiki/Reverse-Engineering#sql-server-stored-procedures

[18:33:15] <kobo> moose, as an avid ORM hater(if I remember it correctlY) how do you do it
[18:33:28] <moose> Yes I despise ORMs. I find them absolutely unnecessary.
[18:33:56] <kobo> How would you do it then? If you have 2000+ sprocs
[18:34:32] <moose> If this is just to get some legacy stuff interoperable, I would definitely do what I mentioned before. I'd write something that generates static methods that take in a connection string and invoke the stored procedure and generates one giant class with all of the methods.
[18:35:25] <moose> If you need very long term maintenance of this and want it to be pretty and proper, I'd do the same thing but then sit down and group all of them by behavior manually and make repositories and extract common models.
[18:35:54] <moose> Unfortunately because the latter part of that is so complicated to do in code correctly, I'd prefer to do it manually than write a generator for it.

[19:52:01] <sysRPL> in the gist it takes on a pascal style of organization. that is `unit Name; uses list; types;`

[19:52:40] <canton7> Right, and IMO that's harder to read
[19:52:41] <sysRPL> if namespcae is more important than usings, then shouldn't namespace be the first line?
[19:53:14] <sysRPL> thank you for your feedback
[19:53:19] <canton7> Well, like it or not, the very top of a file tends to end up being noise: there's normally a copyright comment block, then the usings (which are just uninteresting). Then you reach the namespace and then the types, which are the bits you care about
[19:57:24] <sysRPL> if only pascal had assemblies and allowed for multiple files to share unit names
[19:57:48] <sysRPL> they kind of have assemblies with their super bpl file ... but that'a a delphi only thing

[21:58:17] <_genuser_> phrosty my understanding is that every time somebody does a project, they find something unique and then turn it into a pattern and then either write a grad school paper on it, or blog it. then it gets picked up by career bloggers like martin fowler.
[21:58:35] <_genuser_> who then evangelize it to bits.
[21:58:50] <_genuser_> and then it becomes the new it thing and every dev reading "IT blogs" is doing the new pattern.
[21:59:04] <phrosty> i don't know who martin fowler is but i agree, hype-driven developers  are everywere.
[21:59:22] <sysRPL> so i wanted to write an android program and display a list of items. the only approach, and the approach detailed by the team in charge of the ui toolkit was ...

[22:00:36] <sysRPL> to go to the list view base class, copy the entire draw items implementation code, derive from the list view class, override the draw items method, and paste the code you copied from the base class

[22:01:24] <phrosty> lack of trust in a professional relationship is always challenging
[22:01:25] <sysRPL> is that how things are still done in the android ui toolkit?
[22:01:44] <phrosty> in any relationship, i suppose :)
[22:02:22] <_genuser_> sysRPL new it's slightly better. You use a RecyclerView (or  ListView). You have a ListAdapter, which keeps track of your actual list (objects or primitive types). You write your ListAdapter and implement a specific interface.
[22:02:46] <sysRPL> be the way, the code you were supposed to copy was not an insignificant amount of code
[22:03:10] <_genuser_> sysRPL in your ListAdapter that provides the view of a single item, you can inflate any UI layout you want from a XML based UI Layout file. (for which there's a half-decent UI editor now)

[22:14:40] <moose> phrosty: I was more thinking of the first Windows Phone XD
[22:14:51] <_genuser_> sysRPL I never got into it. And the only movies I"ve really watched is one of the recent ones with the girl and the guy and the bad guy. :straightface: I suppsoe that could be all of them.
[22:14:52] <sysRPL> great, so do you remember these two interesting points from the original 1977 star wars film?
[22:14:52] <phrosty> to be fair, Windows Phone was pretty baller.
[22:15:06] <moose> I did like the gen 1 stuff but they didn't ever reach devs really
[22:15:15] <moose> There was very little utility
[22:15:30] <phrosty> easy to use, really well integrated, ran silky smooth in a way that Android has only just recently achieved.
[22:15:38] <_genuser_> jonp no way, the federation was an alliance of planets. the congress is a a bunch of really old times and a bunch of really young (think aoc) people, NONE of them knowing anything about stuff they makes rules about.
[22:15:53] <jonp> _genuser_: where's the argument?
[22:15:59] <sysRPL> 1) ben says before the empire the jedi kept order in the galaxy and 2) tokin said everyone that fear of the empire will keep everyone in line?
[22:16:01] <phrosty> tho Windows Phone 8 and Windows 10 Phone (i hope i remembered this correctly) were more and more terrible.
[22:16:13] <jonp> sysRPL: yes…
[22:16:20] <bomb> try Windows Phone 7.5 Mango
[22:16:22] <jonp> well, fear of the Death Start, specifically
[22:16:25] <jonp> Star
[22:16:54] <_genuser_> jonp alliance of planets seems like it was a joint purpose to help each other out. Not necessarily dictate rules for every civilization under it's control. whereas congress is all about forcing people into a specific way. so I see them as very different.
[22:17:08] <sysRPL> okay so the story goes like this ... after luke and the rebels destroyed the 2nd death start, the emperor, and vader what happens over the coming years is bad things
[22:17:13] <phrosty> i still keep my Lumia 920 around as a backup phone lol
[22:17:21] <jonp> _genuser_: Congress is about providing/creating *minimums*; states can go above and beyond.
[22:17:33] <jonp> or not
[22:17:48] <sysRPL> there empire destroyed the jedi, and luke broguth down the empire, and no one was left to keep everyone else in line
[22:18:08] <_genuser_> jonp I feel it _was_ about that. Now it's all about "some states aren't doing what we want, so we have to make a federal law." (applies to both major parties).
[22:18:32] <phrosty> _genuser_ how is that any different from setting a minimum
[22:18:39] <_genuser_> I always wanted a windows phone but somehow never got one. :(
[22:18:42] <sysRPL> luke didn't know it but he created a much worse time that either the time with jedi or the time with the empire, and luke was powerless to do anythign about it
[22:19:26] <_genuser_> phrosty I see a minimum as "live free and let live free" (example). Vs. current situation "live free, also don't say this, also don't do that, also must do this, also must do that". The extras.
[22:20:25] <_genuser_> re: phones - I've also quit buying the latest samsung android phones. I just use cheap nokia or motorola ones. $250 max.
[22:20:33] <sysRPL> without the jedi or the empire, local system warlords began to turn the galaxy in a mafia-like extortion racket, with the individual warlords killing offer all kinds of people and in order to exert their power and influence
[22:20:35] <phrosty> what do you mean? how have they done that in a way that isn't to ensure more people live free?
[22:20:50] <_genuser_> if I were to buy another one, I'd increase that to $400 and make sure it has enough space for a lot of apps or allows sd card expansion.
[22:21:19] <jonp> sysRPL: it's hard to predict the future. :-)
[22:21:24] <jonp> even *with* the Force
[22:21:37] <jonp> and who knows, maybe Palpatine would still have been worse?
[22:22:45] <sysRPL> then luke feel into a deep depression and took up life as a hermit in bens old home ... only venturing out to occasionally for his personal sustenance / buying things
[22:22:59] <jonp> sysRPL: *after* his attempt at a Jedi School failed
[22:23:08] <bomb> JakeSays is Jabba lol
[22:23:08] <sysRPL> sure after that
[22:23:11] <jonp> or rather, after he tried to kill Ben Solo
[22:23:24] <_genuser_> phrosty imo, the ensure people live free is enough. to ensure "more" people live free is always at the expense of everyone. because it creates segments of people and then tries to add a type of balance. which can easily be out of balance once populations shifts or ideas changes or society changes. so then it needs more input to balance that. it
[22:23:24] <_genuser_> keeps going.
[22:23:41] <jonp> well, yeah.
[22:23:48] <jonp> nothing is static
[22:24:02] <sysRPL> SO then han solo sees all this as a big opportunity to be the owner of a smuggling company, owning a fleet of smuggling vessels
[22:24:23] <_genuser_> if I can somehow manage to watch the older star wars (older sci-fi fx, etc.) I might have a lot of fun watching the star wars stuff.
[22:24:41] <phrosty> do you have an example?
[22:24:53] <sysRPL> they smuggle goods to places avoiding paying protecting money to the mafia-like warlords who demand a cut of all commerce in the areas they rule over
[22:25:03] <_genuser_> but when I asked friend which one to start with and someone gave me a DVD, it was just hard to start watching that.
[22:25:26] <_genuser_> now star trek TNG isn't that new either, but it's older format doesn't seem to bother me somehow because I'm used to the show/story/characters.
[22:25:47] <MichaelLong> _genuser_, ack
[22:26:04] <sysRPL> but one particular warlord sect eventually gets a bit more power than the rest and becomes even more sadistic and demanding
[22:26:07] <MichaelLong> _genuser_, once you get used to it and sunk in, it doesn't matter
[22:26:11] <sysRPL> are you guys following me?
[22:26:26] <jonp> the Hutts?
[22:26:49] <sysRPL> sure, a hutt derivative sect
[22:27:07] <jonp> why a "derivative"? the Hutts, full stop.
[22:27:19] <jonp> they've "only" been in control for generations of their little areas…
[22:27:31] <jonp> "little"
[22:27:38] <jonp> (if an entire planet can be called "little"…)
[22:27:52] <sysRPL> but these warlords like a mafia group or drug empire here on earth, they have a structure of underlings. captains, lieutenants, enforcers and so on
[22:27:54] <_genuser_> phrosty lol my example will bore you. But I tend to generally ignore thing other people might care about more. So in our example of people live free, it might sound like we're talking about people and their lifestyles and ethnic groups. None of which I bother with.
[22:28:38] <_genuser_> phrosty I tend to look more at stuff like the act creating the SEC. now that sounds like a good idea. protect consumers from market crashes and other charlatans who might takes investor money and run.
[22:29:13] <sysRPL> they are derivative because of all the people they now have in their organization to carry out tasks, and the inner circle of the hutts is now a protected group that doesn't do any of the dirty work personaally
[22:30:01] <sysRPL> okay so that is the settings / back story ... and the action begins when the hutts decide to step their game up
[22:30:03] <jonp> you think Jabba in ROTJ did "work personally"?
[22:30:09] <jonp> and that was *during* the Empire
[22:30:19] <_genuser_> phrosty but then it starts creating other rules. Oh, let's say people can't daytrade unless they have $25k or more. Then it adds more rules to it. Then it adds more rules to things like cryptos. Where people in other countries are free to trade cryptos. We have SEC and IRS trying to understand it. They didn't undrestand it in time, so they tried to
[22:30:20] <_genuser_> just make it look bad. And now they're slowly comes to grips with it. And even promoting it a bit. But only in a specific way where they feel they have control.
[22:30:24] <_genuser_> phrosty etc. etc.
[22:30:40] <jonp> _genuser_: i believe that's called "democracy"
[22:30:53] <jonp> shit happens.  all is complicated.
[22:30:55] <_genuser_> jonp hehe, darn it! you mean everybody gets a voice?
[22:31:03] <sysRPL> jonp: in the original star wars jabba personally met with han at mos eisley
[22:31:08] <jonp> well, not in *this* democracy…
[22:31:08] <moose> We already have crazy rules about hedge funds
[22:31:19] <moose> You can't invest in them without having $300k in annual income or something
[22:31:21] <jonp> sysRPL: no, that was one of the updates
[22:31:30] <moose> Maybe crypto could be the same way
[22:31:33] <sysRPL> it was in the original film and they cut it
[22:31:36] <DevJohnC> what the fuck is going on in here
[22:31:36] <jonp> sysRPL: regardless, it's not like Jabba was threatening to *personally* break Han's legs
[22:31:42] <jonp> he'd have an underling do that.
[22:31:47] <jonp> DevJohnC: i don't know
[22:31:56] <_genuser_> jonp yeah I like the original idea. Gov't provides protection against securities shenanigans. But then it agencies creates it's own rules.... it's out of congress oversight now. Which is where I see it can run out of control.
[22:32:02] <sysRPL> okay anyhow, the hutt mafia warlord group is a lot more complex now
[22:32:12] <sysRPL> and wastly more powerful
[22:32:20] <jonp> _genuser_: so Congress can provide more oversight.  It's been done before, will happen again.
[22:32:27] <_genuser_> DevJohnC we're talking about star wars and congress being like or unlike the federation from Star Trek.
[22:32:34] <jonp> we need a poll
[22:32:41] <sysRPL> but the hutts and the other warlords have some `issues` they want to address
[22:32:42] <jonp> pity this is IRC, and there are no polls
[22:32:58] <brianonymous> weirdly enough i watched a video last night that described the main elemental drivers of starwars vs star trek.. overall dystopian galaxy vs overall utopian galaxy.. and the resource acquisition methods/differences
[22:33:06] *** Quits: sacrebleu (~sacrebleu@c-73-79-254-54.hsd1.pa.comcast.net) (Quit: Client closed)
[22:33:22] <DevJohnC> I just got off a call asking how to justify being immune to the log4j exploit because we use 1.2 and apparently "it's fine to have older dependencies" isn't good enough
[22:33:27] <jonp> brianonymous: i suspect the Star Trek side was vastly underdeveloped.
[22:33:51] *** Quits: DarkSeid (uid394293@id-394293.helmsley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[22:33:51] <jonp> DevJohnC: on the one hand, yay, you don't have to worry about the first (and all other?) log4j issues.
[22:33:53] <_genuser_> jonp imo, it should provide less. easier said than done. For it to provide more oversight, it needs to be more educated about financials issues and cryptos. Which realistically isn't possible for every senator to learn everything about everything. Or even their staff. And then they still have to believe what their staff is summarizing. Then they
[22:33:53] <_genuser_> have personal feelings towards things. Then they direct policy that affects everyone.
[22:33:56] <brianonymous> jonp: yeah, it was more about why the ships of star wars tended to look like ass all the time
[22:33:56] <jonp> on the other hand, wow, 1.2 is old
[22:33:56] <sysRPL> warlord issue #1) smugglers like hans business not paying them #2) someone is going after warlord enforcers and stopping them but it's unknown who is doing this
[22:34:23] <_genuser_> jonp haven't people complained before too that a bunch of old people are making rules that affect young people.
[22:34:23] <jonp> brianonymous: Star Trek hasn't properly fleshed out how the hell economics work, especially considering "gold-pressed latinum"
[22:34:31] <DevJohnC> jonp, yeah but it works and we aren't vulnerable to any of the known exploits so I don't care much lol
[22:34:32] <jonp> *somewhere* in the ST universe they're still using money
[22:34:44] <jonp> how that interacts with "star trek" was never really fleshed out
[22:35:02] <sysRPL> so the hutt warlords concoct a secret plan to fix those two problems
[22:35:04] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: i thought 1.x was also vulnerable, just a little bit harder to exploit
[22:35:05] <brianonymous> in star trek, it seems like the primary currency has to be energy. cuz replicators
[22:35:58] <DevJohnC> there's a bigger problem than the Ferengi currency, Jean Luc Picard has this nice big mansion home on a vineyard and his friend lives in a trailer in a desert somewhere - how do those differences exist if the Star Trek world has "solved" poverty?
[22:36:17] <_genuser_> latinum bars are were typically used to trade with non humans, no?
[22:36:31] <sysRPL> and those plans involve finding this luke skywalker guy who is apparently living somewhere in hiding, and making an example out of han solo and the people who work for han
[22:36:41] <DevJohnC> Suchiman, well technically the vulnerability is JNDI and log4j just kinda makes it super easy to sploit (I think), but we did run a pen test
[22:36:51] <_genuser_> especially the ferengi who almost always have a converstion that revolves around latinum bars.
[22:37:19] <DevJohnC> but the ferengi aren't members of the federation so their use of currency isn't an issue
[22:37:25] <MichaelLong> erm gold pressed latinum....
[22:37:33] <_genuser_> yeah, humans didn't mention currency much.
[22:37:45] <sysRPL> the intro to this sequel starts with a big ass ship in space near tatooine
[22:38:06] <jonp> DevJohnC: stand-alone, the Ferengi & Federation aren't "a problem".  It's the intermixing of them which raises questions.
[22:38:10] <sysRPL> to crew about the ship who for han smuggling goods
[22:38:15] <_genuser_> expect for that one episode in TNG where they revive a trio of idiots cryo-frozen centuries ago and one of them is a rich guy and trying to flex how much his investments would have made.

[22:38:31] <jonp> how do you have a "non-monetary" federation interact with "monetary" Ferengi?
[22:38:36] <DevJohnC> jonp, there's still enough difference in outcomes within the Federation to indicate they haven't solved shit
[22:38:40] <jonp> yeah
[22:38:45] <jonp> nothing's been solved, really.
[22:38:49] <jonp> it's a TV show
[22:38:51] <jonp> SW is a movie
[22:38:54] <_genuser_> jonp lol it's easy. You walk to the nearest replicator, demand a gold-ressed latinum bar, takes to the ferengi and barter away.
[22:38:56] <jonp> don't look to them for truth
[22:39:16] <DevJohnC> and why is Chief O'Brien the only non-com?

[22:39:51] <jonp> too many characters makes the brain hurt
[22:40:01] <_genuser_> DevJohnC I didn't even realize that.
[22:40:05] <sysRPL> they've come out of hyperspace and are getting ready to land at mos eisley to deliver some cargo, and they are signaled unexpectedly by some small ships of the hutt warlord group
[22:40:15] <DevJohnC> everybody else is an officer
[22:40:28] <DevJohnC> O'Brien is a "chief" forever and the only one, WHY?!?!
[22:40:37] <jonp> i think i need to flee from these conversations. :-)

[22:41:39] <sysRPL> the hutt enforcers announce over comms that they suspect their ship of smuggling, they reiterate the penalty (summary agonizing death), and tell them to prepare for boarding
[22:42:03] <DevJohnC> is sysRPL writing a script? a fanfic?

[22:48:41] <sysRPL> the hutt enforcers them demonstrate their sadistic weapons which first painful pin a person to a fixture, then slowly dissolves that person in agonizing pain ... the do this to a young female engineer who is part of the han crew
[22:50:26] <sysRPL> after she dies the hutt enforcer asks the han crew who is 2nd in command. after the 2nd in commands identifies himself, the hutt enforcers dissolve the han ship captain in the same manner they used on the female engineer
[22:52:07] <sysRPL> then a fight break out as the han crew attempts to use the distraction of the captain being dissolved to overpower the enforcers. they fail and in the struggle the enforcers kills everyone but 4 of the remaining han crew
[22:53:46] <sysRPL> the leader of the enforcers does next what is typical of the enforcers. he announces a penalty that the entire ship and its cargo is forfeit. the crew is to land at a particular port at mos eisley and disembark
[22:54:53] <sysRPL> they are to tell anyone and particularly their `employer` (han solo) that this is what happens to smugglers
[22:55:29] <sysRPL> that is, to let other know not to cross with the hutts making other more fearful

[22:58:49] <moose> I have a proxy that monitors HTTP requests and enforces rules. These rules may change. I obviously don't want to query the API constantly and ask "Hey does this URL match any rules?" and would rather do as much locally as possible.
[22:59:22] <moose> Is there a best practice for notifying clients of updated content from a web server without resorting to polling?
[23:01:28] <moose> I was considering implementing something like policy versioning where the client would ask periodically, every 5 minutes or something, about updated rules and provide the version of the policy it has.
[23:01:47] <moose> But that seems like it doesn't scale well.
