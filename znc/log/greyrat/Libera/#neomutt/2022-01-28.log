[10:29:19] <bookworm> gour: virtual mailboxes was a notmuch specific thing. Named-mailboxes came later and by now supports most mail backends, including notmuch.
[10:29:38] <bookworm> You can use them pretty much interchangeably
[10:29:51] <bookworm> although I'd use named-mailboxes by now

[15:31:55] <flatcap> dcpurton: just ideas. shoot down the ones you don't like :-)
[15:31:57] <flatcap> gahr: not _much_, however I have a better idea...
[15:32:36] <flatcap> Discussions would be a much better place for them

[15:32:56] <flatcap> we could still release them weekly, say
[15:33:18] <flatcap> if we pick the "Announcement" type of discussion, then only we can add them
[15:33:32] <flatcap> and, of course, the users can comment on them!

[15:37:43] <gahr> you seem to be very fond of discussions :)
[15:37:56] <flatcap> I'm starting to see the light :-)
[15:38:28] <gahr> I see that discussions and issues/prs share the same labels
[15:38:32] <flatcap> they're a lot more interactive than pieces of pager on my desk
[15:38:34] <flatcap> yes
[15:38:46] <flatcap> we could add more discus-specific labels
[15:39:10] <gahr> can you create categories too?
[15:39:39] <flatcap> yes, but you can't sub-categorise
[15:39:52] <gahr> ah, by "Announcement" type of discussion you meant a category, not a label?
[15:40:14] <gahr> and you can choose who can generate discussions in each category
[15:40:24] * flatcap checks
[15:40:38] <flatcap> "Announcement" is a "Discussion format"
[15:41:21] <gahr> I see
[15:41:23] <flatcap> "Open ended discussion" is a plain list
[15:41:24] <gahr> looking at it
[15:41:43] <flatcap> "Question / Answer" allows "best" replies to be marked
[15:41:48] <gahr> so we can have a DYK category in Announcement format
[15:41:56] <flatcap> yeah
[15:42:38] <gahr> I guess we can try :)
[15:43:14] <flatcap> by promoting neomutt members to "maintainer" (repo settings) we can allow others to create posts in an "Announcement" discussion
[15:44:43] <flatcap> yes.  I suggest weekly, so we don't run out too quickly
[15:44:56] <flatcap> are you offering to run it?
[15:46:02] <flatcap> (oh and we can Pin up to 4 discussions)
[15:47:59] <gahr> I was considering writing a DYK about how I use a mailbox as a todo list
[15:49:34] <flatcap> nice
[15:55:56] <gahr> somehow I think we should do it via email :)
[15:59:05] <flatcap> yeah, it would be ironic not to
[15:59:55] <flatcap> but can you tell me the archive address of the users' mailing list? (without looking it up)
[16:01:25] <jindraj> it would be several guesses and bounces :)
[16:02:14] <flatcap> exactly
[16:05:50] <gahr> we can pin a discussion or an issue with a link I guess
[16:07:39] <flatcap> or cross-post to both (but that dilutes the feedback)
[16:13:25] <flatcap> [ALL] how would people feel if neo-bot replied in two messages, rather than one

[16:26:43] <jindraj> flatcap: description on one line and link on the next line? That would be nice :)
[16:27:04] <flatcap> yeah.  a second line would make it easier to parse
[16:28:52] <jindraj> parse = with human eye sight parser? :)
[16:29:41] <flatcap> yes
[16:32:03] <bookworm> up to 3 is IRC etiquette wise fine I think... could get noisy though if you mention multiple issues in a single request or in short order
[16:32:45] <bookworm> but to be honest, your channel, your rules
[16:32:57] <flatcap> yeah, the bot doesn't de-dupe either
[16:33:29] <bookworm> de dup would be trivial, cooldown for the same issue too
[16:33:52] <bookworm> so that specifying it within say 5min doesn't fetch it again
[16:33:58] <flatcap> ooh, nice!
[16:35:28] <bookworm> for all intents and purposes just make an issue on the bot repo what you'd like to have and assign me, I can always complain when I don't have the time

[17:13:16] <dcpurton> Looking at your list, I think the most useful feature would be the option to insert an attachment at the cursor position. This would also be not too difficult.
[17:13:59] <flatcap> yes, I think without that, users might get irritated :-)
[17:15:57] <dcpurton> If you can't think of any reason not to, I'd also dump the "Alternatives for" strings

[17:17:21] <flatcap> (yes, the user has _just_ created it, but perhaps it was a macro)
[17:17:25] <dcpurton> After that, patterns, expandos and colours
[17:17:38] <dcpurton> It is possible to show the type with the format
[17:17:50] <flatcap> those may require quite a bit of work, I haven't looked into them
[17:17:54] <dcpurton> and the default shows this
[17:18:12] <flatcap> yes, that sounds good
[17:18:27] <dcpurton> I'm not volunteering for the patterns, expandos and colours just yet 😁
[17:18:45] <flatcap> np.  if you can figure out _what_ we need, I'll have think
[17:19:17] <flatcap> the patterns are strongly tied to Emails, so it may be time for a pattern refactoring
[17:19:56] <dcpurton> yeah

[18:24:09] <flatcap> hmm... if the pattern-matching code were able to tell the caller _which_ part of the pattern matched
[18:25:54] <flatcap> patterns are only ever matched against one type of object, but we wouldn't be able to tell which field
[18:27:28] <ianmacd> What I'm trying to do here is set a different smtp_url, based on the domain of the recipient. I need to do this because it has become impossible now to reach some domains using my own MTA, because a couple of large networks have blocked the entire netblocks of the provider whose network my VPS is on, and they will not provide an exemption for my IP
[18:27:28] <ianmacd>  address.
[18:27:31] <flatcap> mutt_pattern_exec() would return: MUTT_PAT_TO, "jim@example.com"
[18:28:04] <flatcap> ouch! that sounds familiar :-(
[18:29:01] <flatcap> for now, you'd have to do it per domain "~t @outlook.com" "set smtp_url = ..."
[18:29:41] <flatcap> I think I can see a way to implement your suggestion (but it'd be quite time-consuming :-)
[18:29:58] * flatcap adds the idea to the master list
[18:30:36] <ianmacd> It's becoming harder and harder for small domains to manage their own email, because big tech is tightening its net all the time.
[18:31:32] <flatcap> yeah
[18:31:59] <flatcap> it's understandable, but no less infuriating
[18:32:20] <ianmacd> Yeah the problem is that I can't just do it for outlook.com, because any domain using outlook.com as its MX has the same problem, so I need to run dig dynamically to determine the MX hosts of the recipient domain and switch
[18:32:41] <ianmacd> to a different smtp_url on that basis.
[18:32:59] <flatcap> urgh
[18:35:30] <ianmacd> any domain that uses protection.outlook.com as its MX now bounces my email.
[18:36:08] <ianmacd> there's a delisting procedure which I followed, but it just says that my 
[18:36:47] <ianmacd> IP address is not blocked because they blocked the whole network belonging to my provider
[18:37:50] <flatcap> :-(
[18:38:18] <ianmacd> it's becoming harder and harder to run an independent mailshop these days many ISPs and VPS providers won't even open port 25 and if you do manage to convince them then big tech makes it very difficult for you to actually send email
[18:38:57] <ianmacd> I fear the internet is regressing we're actually in a much worse state than we were in 25 years ago.

[22:31:19] <flatcap> Herzog: great.  it's common to create ~/.neomuttrc or ~/.config/neomutt/neomuttrc
[22:33:20] <flatcap> neomutt will read /etc/neomuttrc by default https://neomutt.org/guide/configuration
[22:33:47] <Herzog> i made the second one, also applied the zenburn theme. It looks nice now and, which is more important, it's readable
[22:33:56] <flatcap> yeah!
