[10:34:54] <muaddib[m]> Welcome!
[10:34:54] <muaddib[m]> Yes there are trade offs and gains. While some can speak to the deeper theory much better than I can. The fir filter performs the filtering with a traditional time based fir model (accumulate and multiply). The FFT performs an FFT multiply operation which if over a certain number of taps (64 I think) will yield better performance. 
[10:36:49] <muaddib[m]> The tutorials have been getting a lot of attention and I’d suggest you check them out. Also, pysdr.org is an awesome SDR-based learning site for folks who are new to DSP. 
[10:36:49] <muaddib[m]> Those 2 tools will get you very far and id recommend you check them out. Ask questions here or on the discuss-gnuradio mailing list!

[17:52:46] <ahmad_sho[m]> Hi, used GRC examples to create a Tx/Rx ofdm. I added another Rx chain on the same chart (in parallel, as a second receiver), and the BER increased on both receivers. the channels are ideal (no noise, single tap). as soon as i remove one of the receivers, the BER is back to 0. any ideas?
[17:53:31] <tengamorref[m]> Hello, I'm new to GNU radio. I'm trying to make a simple tutorial with my RTL-SDR, but GRC complains about an error: ImportError: DLL load failed while importing osmosdr_python
[17:54:04] <tengamorref[m]> I'm running Win10 and installed GNU-radio using radioconda. 
[17:54:27] <tengamorref[m]> I also have a PlutoSDR, but thought it was easier to start with this.
[18:01:23] <RyanVolz[m]> tengamorref: What does your PATH look like? (`echo %PATH%`)

[18:04:34] <tengamorref[m]> looking through the thread now.
[18:04:38] <RyanVolz[m]> Well you have the same problem, so that's useful! They somehow didn't have the correct PATH, even though conda should take care of that.

[18:09:41] <RyanVolz[m]> Yeah, could be some interference, but in principal they should work together and conda has path priority right now. Do you have issues importing any Python extension, or just osmosdr_python? For instance, can you try to use your rtl-sdr with a soapy block?

[18:17:03] <tengamorref[m]> I'm searching for "Soapy" amongst the blocks, but have nothing of the sorts. I also rebooted the machine and I'm running GNU radio alone. Still same issue.
[18:17:44] <tcarls[m]> wonders if the DLL is being found but has dependencies that aren't present
[18:18:30] <tcarls[m]> ...I've only done development on Windows in the distant past and rarely, but IIRC, if that DLL was built with a version of Visual C++ for which you don't have the appropriate MSVCRT DLL, you could end up with an error of that flavor...
[18:18:41] <tengamorref[m]> I remember messing around with soapy on linux, but not on windows.
[18:18:56] <RyanVolz[m]> What version of GNU Radio are you running? Is it the latest radioconda, so 3.9.5.0?
[18:19:27] <tengamorref[m]> That is correct sir!
[18:21:06] *** Joins: Tof (~Tof@147.161.180.110)
[18:21:29] <RyanVolz[m]> Alright, let me boot up my VM. 3.9.5.0 comes with Soapy blocks, so it should be there somewhere. Regardless, it would be useful to know if anything runs in GNU Radio. Even a simple vector source to null sink or some such.
[18:23:00] <tengamorref[m]> I did a bunch of tutorials up to this point.
[18:23:40] <RyanVolz[m]> tcarls: It absolutely could be that some dependency is not being found. They all *should* be there though, including the appropriate MSVCRT.
[18:23:42] <tengamorref[m]> Then I really wanted to see a real signal, so I tried to use the RTLSDR
[18:24:01] <RyanVolz[m]> That's useful, so it seems related specifically to osmosdr or OOTs.
[18:25:34] <tengamorref[m]> Yes, the only errors I got was me trying to write 70M instead of 70 000 000
[18:25:35] <tengamorref[m]> etc
[18:25:36] <tengamorref[m]> (Which is weird, since that worked fine at first)
[18:25:58] <tengamorref[m]> I did the first 11 beginner tutorials from this page: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Tutorials
[18:28:39] <RyanVolz[m]> So there's really no Soapy RTLSDR Source block available? Should be under Soapy->Source
[18:30:09] <tengamorref[m]> Nothing what I can see, not under "Core", not under any other category
[18:31:28] <RyanVolz[m]> From the Conda Prompt, what do you get from `conda list gnuradio`?
[18:31:35] <BarryDuggan[m]> tengamorref: what about 70e6 ?
[18:32:02] <tengamorref[m]> BarryDuggan[m]: Cheers!
[18:33:33] <BarryDuggan[m]> you can use decimals too, e.g. 146.94e6
[18:33:58] <tengamorref[m]> RyanVolz[m]: No packages
[18:35:27] <RyanVolz[m]> That's puzzling and bad.
[18:36:14] <tengamorref[m]> I also feel bad, coming in here and messing with yer day. I know Win10 is not officially supported.
[18:37:07] <RyanVolz[m]> No no, I want to make this work for people and I'll never know that it doesn't work if people don't report issues!
[18:38:50] <tengamorref[m]> But I had a hard time getting the Pluto to work well in Linux, that's why I switched to Win. Also, the endgoal here is to build material for children in an educational setting, and we have mostly Win10 machines. So if it works well in there, I'll be really happy.
[18:38:51] <tengamorref[m]> children = young adults...
[18:39:57] <RyanVolz[m]> So no gnuradio packages reported makes me suspect that the conda installation is incomplete/broken, and makes me suspect that the GRC you're running is not from the conda installation since apparently it's not installed.
[18:40:49] <RyanVolz[m]> Maybe try (re-)installing gnuradio with `mamba install gnuradio`
[18:41:14] <tengamorref[m]> RyanVolz[m]: The only thing I did was to download the file: radioconda-2022.02.01-Windows-x86_64, and run it. The filesize is 670 MB, and I think it ran without issues.
[18:41:32] <tengamorref[m]> Should I uninstall something first?
[18:41:53] <RyanVolz[m]> No, just try that from the conda prompt.
[18:46:18] <tengamorref[m]> Encountered problems while solving:
[18:46:18] <tengamorref[m]>   - nothing provides requested gnuradio
[18:46:50] <tengamorref[m]> I installed mamba first with: conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
[18:47:05] <tengamorref[m]> Then i typed: mamba install gnuradio
[18:47:08] *** upekkha is now known as metta
[18:49:33] <RyanVolz[m]> This sounds like a separate conda installation than radioconda... and yep, I see now scrolling back that it's just Miniconda on your path. Ok, so I guess you just have a different conda prompt activated. Try to find the radioconda one, which should exist if the installer ran successfully.
[18:50:46] <RyanVolz[m]> > Then i typed: mamba install gnuradio
[18:50:46] <RyanVolz[m]> It can't find it here because it's on the conda-forge channel, which is not the default with a standard Miniconda installation but is with radioconda.
[18:52:26] <RyanVolz[m]> If you have no separate use for it, it might be least confusing to uninstall Miniconda.
[18:54:36] <tengamorref[m]> I have no separate use for it, but it's confusing that it's there since the only thing I did was to download the windows binaries
[18:55:59] <RyanVolz[m]> I don't know... maybe it's an old thing or was installed incidentally by something else.
[18:57:01] <RyanVolz[m]> The radioconda Conda Prompt shows up as "Conda Prompt (radioconda)" in my start menu, so it should be the same as yours.
[18:58:54] <tengamorref[m]> Well, miniconda dates back to october. I installed a software for electron microscopy analysis that day.
[18:59:17] <tengamorref[m]> I have an installer in my downloads-folder
[19:00:28] <MarcLichtman[m]> Anyone have or know of an example IQ file for NOAA HRPT weather imagery?  Trying to test something but all the links I've found are dead now
[19:00:48] <MarcLichtman[m]> It's the 1.7 GHz one
[19:01:13] <RyanVolz[m]> At first I couldn't remember how that other user solved the issue with your same error message, and that was only two days ago, so I don't blame you for forgetting.
[19:02:33] <tengamorref[m]> i had never heard about conda before this day :)
[19:04:14] <RyanVolz[m]> tengamorref: Not to push this off too far on a tangent, but I'm really curious how GNU Radio was running if not from the radioconda prompt. Did you use the start menu icon, or perhaps a different installation?
[19:04:40] <tengamorref[m]> uninstalling miniconda broke something anyway...
[19:05:16] <tengamorref[m]> i used the start menu-icon

[19:05:59] <RyanVolz[m]> Oh yeah, I see PothosSDR on your path so that's probably where the GNU Radio was running from.
[19:07:26] <RyanVolz[m]> At this point, I'd recommend a complete reinstall of radioconda, then make sure that you run "GNU Radio Companion (radioconda)" from the start menu or launch the "Conda Prompt (radioconda)" and use the command line.
[19:07:27] <tengamorref[m]> I'm trying to uninstall and reinstall radioconda now, I could not start GRC after uninstalling miniconda
[19:17:23] <tengamorref[m]> Well, I'm back at Square One. I can run the software, but get the same error with the SDR. But, when running the Conda prompt: conda list gnuradio i get some packages now.
[19:17:52] <tengamorref[m]> how do i launch grc from the conda prompt?
[19:18:32] <RyanVolz[m]> `gnuradio-companion` should do it.
[19:20:03] <tengamorref[m]> OK, so same error. And no Soapy-blocks.
[19:21:12] <tengamorref[m]> But, gnuradio-soapy is installed.
[19:21:54] <RyanVolz[m]> What version does GRC report under Help->About?
[19:22:14] <RyanVolz[m]> Sounds like it's still running the Pothos version somehow.
[19:22:56] <tengamorref[m]> 3.9.5.0 (Python 3.8.12)
[19:23:29] <RyanVolz[m]> Correct version, so must be a blocks path issue.
[19:26:54] <RyanVolz[m]> Let's see what `gnuradio-config-info --userprefsdir --prefs` says. You can also try clearing the directory that it returns for your user preferences dir.

[19:30:27] <tengamorref[m]> Ryan: I need to give on this for just this moment, I have saved the chat and will get back to you either later tonight or during the weekend. (Or when you happen to be around).
[19:31:57] <RyanVolz[m]> No problem. Parting words: the problem now seems to be a bad interaction with PothosSDR, so that's what needs to be figured out.
[19:32:06] <DerekKozel[m]> > global_blocks_path = C:\PothosSDR\share\gnuradio\grc\blocks
[19:33:20] <DerekKozel[m]> Yep, that's not where RadioConda should be looking. This sounds like another instance of when having the localized prefs directory/path would help. Hopefully that PR gets another review now that the 3.10/Ubuntu 22.04 focus is lifting.
[19:38:26] <tengamorref[m]> Thanks, I'll talk to you later.

[20:37:23] <tcarls[m]> Is there a conventional / best-practice way to represent a sequence of bits that may not satisfy `(len(bits) % 8 == 0)` (and thus may not fit well into a packed binary sequence)? Looking at PMT, I see support for vectors of uint8s, but not a vector-of-bits representation.
[20:38:24] <tcarls[m]> (to be fair, the amounts of data I'm handling are small enough that using a byte to represent each bit is not the end of the world).
[20:52:14] <JDemel[m]> tcarls: most software that doesn't require byte alignment expects a sequence of bits to start at a byte boundary and ends with e.g. the last 3 bit in the next byte as the 3 MSB bytes.
[20:52:35] <JDemel[m]> At least that's how I've seen things implemented.
[20:53:29] <tcarls[m]> Reasonable enough.
[20:53:30] <JDemel[m]> Besides, if you need small vectors, it is probably more convenient (and more efficient) to just have one bit per byte. packing and unpacking bits tends to take time.

[23:13:28] <willcode4[m]> jemius: The RC filter is simpler than the RRC, so you could just implement it in a python statement. For a more fun way, convolve the RRC with itself to get the RC. This is what happens when the tx and rx both apply a RRC.
[23:14:14] <jemius> willcode4[m], yeah, I was thinking about a similar "hack", but was too lazy ^^
[23:16:05] <willcode4[m]> Or, as a more wasteful variant, use two back-to-back RRC filters, effectively doing the convolution.
