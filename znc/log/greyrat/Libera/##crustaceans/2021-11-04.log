[13:13:58] <gerikson> since 1972 or whatever
[13:14:56] <gerikson> the reason for leap seconds is to keep UTC (=basis for civil timekeeping) in sync with UT (terrestial time, determined by astronomical calculations)
[13:15:32] <gerikson> because the second was determined after taking the mean of astronomical observations over a century or so
[13:15:52] <gerikson> so this raises the question, what is "real time" ?

[16:23:55] <gerikson> weirdly Google is seldom mentioned
[16:24:27] <dimadima> Rust cargo cult could be a pun

[16:37:40] <dimadima> telling me that _ is a privilege is pretty freaking obnoxious and inappropriate

[16:39:24] <dimadima> it's got it all, even "candy"
[16:39:36] <dimadima> albeit in the form of a domain name
[16:39:48] <gerikson> JFC
[16:40:37] <dimadima> i just went to that URL and wow
[16:41:03] <dimadima> it's worth looking at
[16:41:20] <dimadima> the sadness for humanity the content therein produces in me is ... substantial
[16:41:57] <dimadima> all the abuses of industrial capitalsim, all the colonial exploitation
[16:42:10] <dimadima> somehow does not trigger sadness as great in me as that page
[16:42:37] <dimadima> there's something special about potentially selling a $500 NFT of 2021 World Series ‚Ä®Gold Trophy
[16:42:48] <dimadima> that "drops" on 11/4/2021
[16:43:09] <dimadima> meanwhile the silver trophy is "Available at fanatics.com with $250 Purchase"
[16:43:59] <dimadima> it's something about the relationship these people envision with their consumer
[16:44:11] <dimadima> $500!! wow.
[16:44:18] <Brekkjern> I fucking despise the UX of Zoom...

[16:50:55] <Brekkjern> It's kinda funny how they are trying to introduce scarcity to something where infinite abundance is the point
[16:51:25] <dimadima> initially, some years ago when i heard of NFTs for the first time, i thought that was freaking awesome
[16:51:41] <dimadima> never in my wildest dreams could i have envisioned this
[16:52:58] <dimadima> Brekkjern: i totally appreicate you probably think it's pretty dumb to think "scarcity to something where infinite abundance is the point" would be "freaking awesome" -- i have no explanation
[16:53:20] <dimadima> i thought it was cool conceptually
[16:53:27] <Brekkjern> No, it makes sense for contracts and all that kind of stuff
[16:54:12] <Brekkjern> It just doesn't make sense for digital "objects" where ownership does not make any real sense
[16:54:48] <dimadima> so it's not ownership in the traditional sense of the word
[16:54:53] <dimadima> and it's a shame so many people think of it that way
[16:55:10] <dimadima> because obviously that makes 0 sense
[16:55:38] <dimadima> the confusion around that only makes the current NFT thing all the more pathetic

[17:24:32] <dimadima> the latter was particularly revelatory when i discovered it finally because i *knew* it just had to be possible
[17:25:18] <dimadima> there was a good DOS wordperfect thread on HN some time in the last few years. someoen big still uses it

[17:26:26] <companion_cube> I mean if you want clean design, don't use python in the first place :D
[17:26:35] <ngoldbaum> excuse me, luv 2 build a financial system on pickle
[17:26:45] <companion_cube> :DD
[17:26:50] <gerikson> otherwise Word is de rigeur in the publishing world
[17:28:17] <companion_cube> I feel like the same things, but on erlang, would be killer design

[17:57:25] <buttsbot> An oral history of Bank Python | Lobsters
[17:57:41] <ngoldbaum> in lots of places in finance money is treated as a continuous variable
[17:57:53] <ngoldbaum> so it would be incorrect to use integers or whatever
[17:58:04] <ngoldbaum> because you need to correctly track fractions of a penny
[17:59:49] <hoistbypetard> so when i've had to do that for accounting, we've declared "millicents" (or similar... i don't think we ever did microcents but I saw it once) our unit of currency
[18:00:18] <hoistbypetard> but i can see why projecting on a model would use floats
[18:02:04] <hoistbypetard> i think projections vs transactions was what i was missing in the article, really

[20:19:21] <dimadima> he really got his invite?
[20:19:36] <dimadima> i thought indigo was joking
[20:19:36] <indigo> Yes :-)
[20:19:50] <dimadima> omg he did
[20:19:54] <dimadima> sorry i missed that
[20:20:02] <indigo> The more users on the site, the higher the probability of someone getting an invite
[20:20:35] <dimadima> wow, weird
[20:24:39] <cb_> microsoft visual foxgirl
[20:25:00] <indigo> I think the invite-only thing doesn't work too well once you reach a certain size
[20:25:24] <indigo> Eg. if the chance of someone sending a spammer an invite is 1%, then if you have 100 people inspect a spammer's invite, that chance rises to 1 - (0.99)^100 = 63% :P
[20:25:26] <edm> that doesn't seem obviously true to me
[20:25:33] <edm> oh i see your logic
[20:25:38] <edm> i thought you were arguing the opposite
[20:26:26] <indigo> Of course this is in the land of set probabilities and spherical cows
[20:31:23] <jlindgren> aka a mathematicians dream!
[20:48:53] <dimadima> indigo: heh
[20:51:17] <dimadima> the answer should be then that you only get invite privileges if own a certain amount of land
[20:51:56] <Brekkjern> I'm almost afraid to continue the joke...
[20:52:47] <dimadima> i know ...
[20:52:57] <dimadima> that's about as far as i was willing to take it myself
[20:53:28] <dimadima> but i did enjoy the concept enough to make it in that form
[20:53:52] <dimadima> i've been listening to a lot of history podcasts, what can i say
[20:54:17] <dimadima> (i should have said--- "what joke?!?!")
[20:54:50] <dimadima> in a similar vein, i once joked to someone that politically i most strongly align with the conservative reactionaries
[20:54:56] <dimadima> i don't think they got it :(
[20:56:03] <Brekkjern> I don't either, but then again, both contemporary and historical American politics is nucking futs.

[21:52:51] <imode> yeah, it changes your money into my money.
[21:52:56] <indigo> I guess this way users with more points will get more say? Can't you just weigh polls with karma instead?

[21:53:32] <imode> you're not thinking in the eyes of someone who wants to make money, indigo. they don't give a shit about your communities or feature.s

[21:56:46] <dimadima> yeah i know

[21:57:34] <imode> mmm.
[21:57:35] <dimadima> discourse didn't invent that
[21:57:56] <dimadima> $100/month is... a lot though :(
[21:57:58] <imode> the more we pretend we are the same, the more people can exploit us.
[21:58:08] <dimadima> it should cost like 10$/mo + storage past some threshhold
[21:58:23] <imode> dimadima: but I can't extract money from you that way.
[21:58:24] <dimadima> < imode> the more we pretend we are the same, the more people can exploit us. | huh

[22:00:08] <dimadima> :)
[22:00:27] <imode> the problem is.. they're right.
[22:00:40] <indigo> You'd be surprised how many folks can't write a basic grocery list
[22:00:40] <dimadima> "the ability to write a grocery list" < some of us just go shopping, bra
[22:00:57] <ngoldbaum> innumeracy is a problem in society
[22:00:58] <companion_cube> you pleb, not even writing a shopping list on the web3
[22:01:05] <dimadima> lol
[22:01:10] <dimadima> imode: who's right
[22:01:10] <ngoldbaum> ‚Äúi hate math‚Äù is so common
[22:01:11] <imode> why can't my grocery lists be stored in the blockchain.
[22:01:17] <imode> dimadima: rau is.
[22:01:19] <companion_cube> indigo: how do you mean
[22:01:24] <companion_cube> they can't write a list of items?
[22:01:35] <dimadima> oh god "I am not arguing that folks who cannot write their own shaders are disabled"
[22:02:07] <imode> people don't want to think about computers because we have slowly and carefully lowered the barrier to entry to computing.
[22:02:11] <dimadima> imode: that may be true but why do people on lobste.rs keep using the term "disabled" in that context
[22:02:14] <imode> low barriers to entry are not good things.
[22:02:18] <imode> dimadima: I dunno, disability fetishes?
[22:02:21] <imode> v.v.v

[22:02:23] <dimadima> systemmicaly disadvantaged?
[22:02:55] <dimadima> lol that guy is pointing at a butt
[22:02:58] <imode> there are a few things in life where low barriers to entry are acceptable. basic necessities, for instance.
[22:03:06] <dimadima> peopel who can't read aren't disabled
[22:03:22] <imode> computing should not be one of them. I'm not saying we have to lock everything behind glorified obfuscation but a little friction gets people's brains working.
[22:03:23] <dimadima> people who want to be taken seriously should be precise with language
[22:03:59] <dimadima> imode: sure
[22:04:09] <imode> make people think.
[22:04:29] <dimadima> i mean, i remember just a few weeks ago you were discussing/debating how everyone who has any self respect should know how to do a trie
[22:04:32] <dimadima> i don't disagree with that
[22:04:35] <companion_cube> imode: what aspects of computing?
[22:04:47] <dimadima> conceptually
[22:04:48] <companion_cube> it's so large that every one of us needs low barriers somewhere
[22:05:05] <imode> that's right! you always need an introduction.
[22:05:09] <companion_cube> unless you want to write your own OS, compiler, editor, browser, drivers, and graphic stack
[22:05:15] <imode> that's not the barriers that I'm talking about.
[22:06:09] <imode> expecting someone to cross the "do everything from scratch" barrier is just unrealistic when they don't even have a concept of "how to do X in an organized fashion".
[22:06:13] <dimadima> my impression is that imode thinks that some things just require thinking, inescapably
[22:06:24] <dimadima> which  iagree with, at some point you need to apply effort
[22:06:27] <imode> they do, and shielding that from people is bad.
[22:06:46] <companion_cube> imode: I mena, in that list, most things I don't even know how they work
[22:06:58] <companion_cube> and yet I can use a computer to do the things I understand
[22:07:01] <imode> that's fine, you still understand where they fit in the conceptual hierarchy of things.
[22:07:11] <companion_cube> (insert joke about CS PhDs struggling with setting up a beamer)
[22:07:21] <imode> you understand what they are used for. you understand where they are used. you understand what problems they solve.
[22:07:52] <imode> to use a computer, you must compute. to compute it so exercise your logical thinkin' skills. organization, decomposition, abstraction.
[22:07:59] <companion_cube> heh, sure
[22:08:14] <imode> *to compute it so -> to compute is to
[22:08:21] <imode> clearly a cosmic ray hit my brain.
[22:08:44] <dimadima> bitflippin
[22:08:53] <imode> that seems like a pretty banal statement, but I have _programmers_ that can't compute.
[22:09:31] <imode> they cannot put two objects they've encountered together in their brain and derive what steps they should take next, despite all the information needed to do that being contained in those two objects.
[22:09:51] <companion_cube> :/
[22:10:14] <imode> it's one thing to be charitable starting out but I don't have time to entertain the development process for these programmer's logical thinking abilities.
[22:10:30] <imode> because eventually you just don't think. you find a path to a solution that's faster and easier than thinking.
[22:10:34] <imode> and then you use that.
[22:10:35] <companion_cube> you should incentivize your programmers on the web3, imode
[22:10:45] <companion_cube> place crypto auctions for tickets
[22:10:46] <imode> yeah your stock vests are now on the blockchain.
[22:10:55] <imode> lmao.
[22:11:14] <imode> but genuinely, this doesn't just apply to programmers at work, it applies to _people_.
[22:11:43] <imode> we aren't equipped to cross barriers without training, but that training isn't economical, apparently.
[22:11:46] <companion_cube> I tihnk excel is the closest we have to non programmers using computers 4realz
[22:11:56] <companion_cube> and it does require to think :D
[22:12:18] <imode> developing critical thinking skills is apparently not a core value, because if it were, facebook wouldn't exist. the computing landscape would be so different, along with a host of other things.
[22:12:38] <companion_cube> facebook the keeping in touch thing would exist I think
[22:12:40] <imode> people don't want to think because they're always offered the opportunity to go under the barriers in front of them, for a modest cost. be it time, money, or privacy.
[22:12:46] <imode> oh it would. that's a practical thing.
[22:12:48] <companion_cube> facebook the spying/disinformation network, perhaps not
[22:13:06] <imode> I don't think it would be on facebook.
[22:13:17] <imode> but "keeping in touch" is a platform-agnostic thing.
[22:13:32] <companion_cube> I think the networks effects are too strong
[22:13:37] <companion_cube> there'd be centralization anyway :(
[22:14:01] <imode> imo centralization is a function of the market.
[22:14:10] <imode> in that if you have enough money it just pops out.
[22:14:16] <imode> and if you don't, everybody does their own thing.
[22:14:23] <imode> case in point, old forum culture.
[22:14:35] <imode> nobody had the money to centralize computing. once someone did, they did it.
[22:15:01] <imode> what's even weirder to think about is that it used to all be centralized by default. university mainframes and timesharing.
[22:15:13] <imode> we finally got away from that and now we're deciding to go _back_.
[22:15:28] <Brekkjern> IMO, what "everyone" should learn in school is how to open a file with a programming language, read the contents, loop over it and concatenate a string with each line of the file and print it to the monitor.
[22:15:29] <imode> the next 50 years will tell us if this forms a wave or a curve.
[22:15:47] <imode> Brekkjern: that's not really a good measure of logical thinking skills.
[22:15:48] <companion_cube> Brekkjern: wrong!
[22:15:48] <Brekkjern> And I don't expect them to remember how to do it 5 minutes after the class
[22:15:53] <companion_cube> one must learn to produce a DOM with react.
[22:16:02] <imode> that doesn't apply to anything else I do in life.
[22:16:11] <imode> whereas the idea of an algorithm is actually very useful, you use it every day.
[22:16:13] <dimadima> Brekkjern: i was surprised to learn, and i think imode was the one who told me this, that some huuuge percentage of kids these days apparently get that instruction in school
[22:16:20] <Brekkjern> The point is to show people that it's rather simple to get a program to load a file and do something for each line in that file
[22:16:24] <dimadima> i would guess that leads you nowhere in the big picture
[22:16:27] <imode> Brekkjern: what's a file.
[22:16:28] <imode> what's a line.
[22:16:30] <imode> what's a program.
[22:16:33] <imode> what's "load" mean.
[22:16:38] <imode> what's "something".
[22:16:45] <Brekkjern> imode: Yes, that is what a class would have to teach them.
[22:16:51] <dimadima> kids need to be left alone to play and use their imaginations as much as possible, to discover and cultivate curiosity if they're capable of that
[22:17:00] <imode> the conclusion doesn't fit the effort to produce it.
[22:17:06] <imode> you need to be far more abstract.
[22:17:10] <Brekkjern> The point is to illustrate the strengths of a computer so they can identify idiotic tasks they could ask a programmer to do rather than doing it manually.
[22:17:15] <imode> computers are a specific case of things that algorithms apply to.
[22:17:35] <imode> not everyone is going to be a programmer, but everyone operates on some algorithm day to day. algorithms aren't tied to computing, they're a mathematical construct.
[22:17:39] <imode> they're an abstract construct.
[22:18:02] <dimadima> Brekkjern: that kind of literacy may jog something in a perosn's mind, but if they don't have curiosity, they won't get further than what they were taught formally
[22:18:06] <imode> teach a man to think in algorithms, and he'll know how to compute.
[22:18:18] <Brekkjern> dimadima: You mean like the poetry analysis I had in school?
[22:18:28] <dimadima> what was that like
[22:18:31] <imode> ah yes that forced pile of shit.
[22:18:33] <dimadima> i'm guessing it was bad
[22:18:39] <Brekkjern> Well, I don't know. It didn't jog my curiosity to learn about it.
[22:18:41] <dimadima> ____ in school turns out to be shit

[22:18:59] <dimadima> once you commodify that educational experience, it's pretty much rotten
[22:19:00] <Brekkjern> But my point is that for some people it was probably fucking amazing and they went into litterature
[22:19:12] <dimadima> i wouldn't be surprised
[22:19:15] <imode> because schools aren't for enriching kids to become people (in the same way that you enrich uranium), they're for babysitting them while the parents grind for money.
[22:19:27] <dimadima> Brekkjern: but i don't know, i doubt that it was for many
[22:19:41] <Brekkjern> The point of what I suggested was that non-developers would be able to identify mindless drudgery work that a computer probably could do faster, more efficiently, and more repeatedly than what a human could do
[22:19:41] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[22:19:56] <imode> that's great for people who want to go into computing.
[22:19:58] <Brekkjern> They wouldn't have to remember how to do it. I sure as hell can't analyse a sentence anymore for example.
[22:20:28] <companion_cube> Brekkjern: start by looking for the verb

[22:47:42] <imode> companion_cube: no wonder they're worried about their kids having guns. ;)
[22:47:45] <dimadima> they live in bad areas, their kids have bad influences (or are the bad influence)
