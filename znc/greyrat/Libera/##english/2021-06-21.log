[00:20:31] <MetaNova> although through exposure/common use I am most familiar with definition #2

[00:48:54] <paulo_> I thought I was right
[00:49:41] <raccoon_dog> I'm not 100% sure there is a "right" or "wrong" here -- if you want to keep "regime" and "regimen" distinct, that's fine; all the dictionary shows is that people do use them synonymously for some definitions.
[00:54:57] <raccoon_dog> And this is just M-W. You can do more thorough analyses of the usage itself. For instance, the answer by nohat analyzes the collocates of both words: https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1966/whats-the-difference-between-regime-and-regimen
[00:56:04] <raccoon_dog> And based on those analyses, it does seem that "regimen" is used more for diets, workout routines, etc., whereas "regime" refers to politics and manners of governing.

[03:46:30] <furrykef> Angle
[03:46:38] <furrykef> Land of the Angles
[03:47:11] <furrykef> In Old English, it was called "Engla land"
[03:47:19] <raccoon_dog> Land of the Angles? That's a protracted explanation.
[03:47:21] * raccoon_dog canned laughter.
[03:47:32] <furrykef> This contracted to "England" through a linguistic process called haplology, where repeated sounds get dropped.
[03:47:57] <furrykef> ("Haplology" is itself nicknamed "haplogy" to demonstrate the phenomenon)
[03:48:06] <raccoon_dog> Or get replaced with others. Like in Spanish, "le lo" becomes "se lo."
[03:49:30] <furrykef> That's not haplology, but yes, that can happen too.
[03:49:51] <raccoon_dog> Right; as in, that's another way to deal with the problem, even though it's not specifically called haplology.
[03:50:21] <furrykef> Why that happened in Spanish is still a bit of a mystery, I think, since other Romance languages don't do it.
[03:50:29] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, it is interesting.
[03:51:47] <furrykef> The word "king" underwent the same process; it was "cyning" in Old English.
[03:51:50] <raccoon_dog> Haplology also happens more than you think, though. For example, words like "probably" are often pronounced as "pro(b)ly."
[03:51:56] <furrykef> Yep.
[03:52:57] <r3> how does one pronounce "cyning" ?
[03:53:11] <furrykef> Hmm... do you know how to pronounce the German ü sound?
[03:53:18] <r3> uh
[03:53:20] <furrykef> Or the French "u" sound
[03:53:36] <furrykef> As in "omelette du fromage"
[03:53:42] <r3> oui
[03:54:21] <furrykef> OK, so you pronounce "cyning" as "kuning", where the "u" is that French "u".
[03:54:49] <r3> and the -ing is like the modern -ing?
[03:55:01] <rcm888> What does it mean "angles"? like geometry angles?
[03:56:02] <raccoon_dog> rcm888: No; it refers to a Germanic tribe.
[03:56:12] <raccoon_dog> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles
[03:56:28] <furrykef> Yep, those guys.
[03:56:50] <raccoon_dog> My "joke," if it can be called that, did try to take advantage of the double entendre, though.
[03:56:55] <furrykef> The reason they're called Angles is uncertain, but it's speculated that it may be related to the term "angling" (as in fishing).
[03:57:11] <raccoon_dog> Since protracted, protractor, angle protractor.
[03:57:45] <r3> furrykef: thanks for that - quite interesting
[03:57:50] <furrykef> You're welcome
[03:58:51] <r3> any other surprising Old English words?  Your top three perhaps?  ;)
[03:59:57] <furrykef> I can't think of anything off the top of my head...

[04:01:06] <r3> any haplology going on there?
[04:01:20] <raccoon_dog> Cwēn.
[04:02:14] <r3> eek ... as in "Engla cwēn"
[04:02:21] <furrykef> Yeah, nothing too special about that one.
[04:02:24] <furrykef> Oh, I remember one.
[04:02:24] <r3> heh
[04:02:33] <furrykef> "Lord" comes from "hlāford"
[04:02:39] <furrykef> Meaning loaf-ward
[04:02:47] <furrykef> Someone who guards the bread.
[04:02:51] <rcm888> I heard of some Inglings cultists...
[04:03:14] <raccoon_dog> Does that have to do with the Lord's Prayer? Since the Lord is supposed to "give us this day our daily bread."
[04:03:48] <r3> furrykef: really?  Guarding bread?  Very interesting.  I wonder if that meant literal bread or more of a figurative "supplies" or "food"
[04:03:52] <r3> oh, interesing, raccoon_dog
[04:04:07] <raccoon_dog> I'm just asking, though. I don't know if that is the etymology.
[04:04:14] <furrykef> Well, hlāf usually literally meant bread, but in this specific context probably meant food in general.
[04:04:19] <r3> no I mean I didn't think of it that way until you said so
[04:04:20] <furrykef> Hmm
[04:04:22] <raccoon_dog> I see.
[04:04:29] <furrykef> There's an Old English Lord's Prayer. Let me check it
[04:05:00] <rcm888> wait wait wait. bread is brod in Norsk.

[04:10:14] <rcm888> It is embarrassing that nobody know the right answer.
[04:14:23] <furrykef> Another interesting thing about Old English is people said "axe" for "ask" even back then. Or rather they sometimes said "axian" instead of "ascian".
[04:15:12] <raccoon_dog> I see; so that feature isn't just prominent in AAVE, but it has a long history.
[04:15:34] <rcm888> furrykef: nothing special, x is read as sc and sometimes in reverse, as cs.
[04:18:06] <rcm888> it comes from Samskrit actually, word "ska", the question. and the Q "kyu" is literally question. in Finnish sounds like kysymys. Starts with Q.
[04:20:36] <furrykef> Can't say I know what you're on about there...

[04:30:05] <rcm888> it is too simple, and that is why it is hard to believe.

[04:35:48] <r3> I was just kidding as folks tend to pronounce it like sequel
[04:36:53] <rcm888> sequel is alike consequences.
[04:37:36] <rcm888> Still anyone thinks that I'm troll?
