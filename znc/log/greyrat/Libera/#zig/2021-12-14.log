[02:43:38] <andrewrk> ifreund, yeah I find musl to be generally much cleaner and nicer
[02:44:00] <andrewrk> however I will note that I recently also had to do some creative engineering for musl stubs: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/tools/gen_stubs.zig
[02:44:48] <andrewrk> in this case they don't have metadata sitting around to describe what symbols are available on what targets, so I had to build musl for all the targets and then this script analyzes the libc.so files and generates libc.S with the differences represented with the preprocessor

[02:53:16] <andrewrk> just looked- hmm yeah I think I agree with you on both points
[02:54:14] <ifreund> one thing I realized about the waiting till after 0.9.0 though, we would then need to wait until after 0.10.0 to do the second rename
[02:54:47] <ifreund> cause we need one full release cycle of zig fmt magic fix, but if we re-use anytype we'd have a conflict if both are active at once
[02:55:21] <ifreund> that's fine though, it will just be even longer till I get to stop writing c_void :D

[02:57:47] <andrewrk> there's a small part of me that still wants to make inferred type parameters have the same syntax as inferred type variables, i.e. omit the colon and type expression entirely

[02:58:10] <andrewrk> the argument against that is that it makes it too easy to use inferred type parameters
[02:58:23] <andrewrk> but idk, I'm kind of fine with that
[02:58:58] <ifreund> hmm, I feel like that would look really weird for anytype fields
[02:59:07] <ifreund> which we need for std.builtin.TypeInfo sadly
[02:59:11] <andrewrk> mm good point

[03:00:24] <andrewrk> there are alternatives to solving that problem that remove the need for an anytype struct field from the language
[03:00:48] <ifreund> I'd love to see that happen, anytype fields are really weird
[03:01:07] <ifreund> much worse than anytype arguments IMO
[03:02:59] <ifreund> anhow, I really like anytype as the replacement for c_void, I think it makes a lot of sense and is consistent with the other anyfoo keywords. anyopaque feels wrong if I think a bit harder about the literal meaning of the keyword
[03:04:39] <ifreund> I also kinda wanted to get the usingnamespace -> mixin rename in for 0.9.0 to coincide with the semantics change and maybe ease confusion there, but I realized today that that rename isn't actually accepted yet
[03:04:45] <andrewrk> I see what you mean, but anytype makes it seem like this should be possible: `var x: anytype = 1234; x = "hello";`
[03:05:20] <andrewrk> I'm not sold on "mixin" yet; I feel that it has extra implications and encourages certain patterns that it's not meant to
[03:05:31] <ifreund> fair enough
[03:05:42] <andrewrk> I have ruby battle scars

[03:07:05] <andrewrk> is it merge-ready? it's still marked as draft

[03:08:22] <andrewrk> ok got it

[03:09:18] <andrewrk> it's a ton of investment that won't start paying dividends until we ship
[03:10:00] <ifreund> yeah, it's a quite ambitious compiler and will be awesome once it self hosts
[03:11:32] <ifreund> I'm flying back to the US for the holidays on saturday by the way and can't build zig on my laptop cause it doesn't have enough RAM
[03:11:53] <andrewrk> noooo
[03:11:55] <ifreund> so any locally tested patches from me will have to happen before then :D
[03:12:34] <andrewrk> saturday is 2 days before the release, hopefully by then it will only be release notes left to do :)
[03:12:50] <ifreund> yeah :)
[03:13:02] <ifreund> how you doing with release stress by the way?
[03:13:23] <andrewrk> pretty well actually because I gave myself a whole month to polish it, and planned out my time in a realistic schedule
[03:13:41] <ifreund> nice ^^
[03:14:04] <ifreund> it's also well timed with a nice holiday break afterwards for everyone to relax and update their projects

[04:31:47] <ifreund> probably something has changed on my system since then

[20:34:03] <ifreund> marler8997: I don't expect you could write that into the spec without introducing a lot of extra complexity...
[20:34:16] *** duck27 is now known as duck2
[20:34:16] <ifreund> if it's even possible to do robustly
[20:34:42] <marler8997> yeah could be, I'm thinking through how you could even detect it
[20:35:38] <marler8997> one way to consider is disallowing "x = ..." when x is not "undefined", unless x is apart of the assignment?   Already seems complex
[20:36:21] <companion_cube> a lot of variable reuses are conditional
[20:36:27] <companion_cube> good luck with that
[20:39:26] <marler8997> what's a conditional reuse?  If you modify a variable inside an if, and that variable is used after the if, that wouldn't be the "reuse" I'm thinking of
[20:40:18] <companion_cube> right, but you have to detect this use case
[20:41:32] <marler8997> oh I see, so you'd have to know whether or not the current codepath is "conditional", more complexity in the detection
[20:41:59] <marler8997> at an initial glance it does seem complex like ifruend said

[21:09:43] <marler8997> now that I'm in language thinking brain, look at this weird idea I came up with for addressing needing two scope to start a while loop with scoped variable: https://gist.github.com/marler8997/3c32084f6a30f14e9019555d85bca089
[21:10:14] <marler8997> after I wrote it though, I don't like it :)
[21:13:53] <ifreund> marler8997: have you actually run into a bug caused by the thing you're trying to prevent yet? I haven't
[21:14:37] <marler8997> ifruend you're talking about the reuse variable right, not the last thing I just sent?
[21:15:31] <ifreund> marler8997: either
[21:16:06] <ifreund> zig's strictness on shadowing makes it a non issue in my experience so far
[21:16:10] <marler8997> you probably haven't run into any "reuse variable" bugs because you write good code that doesn't reuse them.  I've written a few bugs with that feature a long time ago, and I see that bug manifest in code reviews fairly often
[21:16:18] <marler8997> talking about non-zig code though
[21:17:04] <marler8997> Zig's shadowing wouldn't have had an affect on the bugs I'm thinking of though
[21:17:47] <marler8997> The "inline while" example I showed doesn't prevent any bugs that I know of, it's addressing people's concerns about having to create 2 scopes when you have a simple thing like a counter loop.

[22:02:38] <mischief> marler8997: is there a linter that will apply that style?
[22:03:09] <marler8997> zig fmt is the only linter I know of, don't know if it applies all those rules though
[22:05:21] <ifreund> it doesn't enforce any naming rules or line length
