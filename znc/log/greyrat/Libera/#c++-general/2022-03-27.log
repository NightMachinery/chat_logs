[01:24:55] <rty> perhaps an weird question, but I have a text that contains things like '#', '\', and I want to paste the text verbatim into c++ source file conditionally (the text is a special control sequence, must be pasted verbatim). is there some macro library, or something, which has a routine, which consumes a string and escapes all the special characters somehow, and then I can control this macro
[01:24:56] <rty> somehow (e.g. by defining some variable in targeted source file)? basically, I need to escape special macro symbols and paste a wall of text verbatim

[01:43:51] <bobb_> Hi, why may somebody use an integer literal in std::uint64_t value = 123456789102u; ?
[01:44:21] <rty> the actual goal is to make the targeted source file scriptable, like you would do with a shebang. except that if you chmod +x a source file and run it in bash/zsh, it starts to be executed in sh/bash respectively, which allows it to self-compile, self-link, self-cache the temporary object etc. that's quite some fun. and now I want to 1) move the shell instructions outside of the targeted
[01:44:23] <rty> source file, 2) parameterize the shell instructions. goal: no build system, just ./source_file. re: parameterize, I can use shell arguments, but with that I cannot move it into a different file. if I move it into different file and #include it, as RandomReader suggests, I lose parametrization. tough! :)
[01:47:07] <rty> obvious solution is to have a daemon that watches the changes on the targeted source file and recompiles it automatically, but that is not as fun as not using any external introspection (extraspection?) at all
[01:52:35] <rty> bobb_: well, without literal you get either an int, or long int, or long long int. then integer conversion from signed to unsigned needs to happen. with literal you get straight to an unsigned int or unsigned long, or unsigned long long. smarter people will correct me
[01:57:14] <bobb_> rty okay, interesting. Do you know if a brace-enclosed initializer changes something on what you describe?
[01:58:10] *** Quits: meator (~meator@user/meator) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:58:39] <rty> afaik, braces prohibit narrowing conversions. afaik, signed to unsigned is not a narrowing conversion, bobb_
[01:59:29] <rty> if you were to attemt to initialize an unsigned with a double literal, e.g. 3.14, braces would prohibit that

[02:02:19] <bobb_> rty okay thats reasonable, thank you!
[02:02:38] <rty> happy to help
[02:08:31] <RandomReader> rty - maybe the "heredoc" concept would be useful: have the beginning exectuable part use the heredoc convention to extract the source, pass that to the compiler
[02:09:17] <RandomReader> (pass to compiler as stdin)
[02:10:07] <RandomReader> as long as you choose a unique marker, the source shouldn't need any transforms
[02:10:51] <RandomReader> that still makes this a shell script rather than C++ source though

[02:14:39] <RandomReader> for embedding things in C++ source, there's always raw string literals (which basically have the same unique-marker concept) .. although I'm not sure how that would help with the execution in this scenario
[02:16:27] <rty> now that you wrote about strings. actually I'm totally wrong. the macro way wouldn't have worked anyway. I cannot mix two contexts: preprocessing happens as part of compilation, and compilation is launched by the shell commands which must be already present in the source!

[02:20:23] <InPhase> rty: I have a C++ written executable I wrote back in 2016 called "mrun" that I use like #!/usr/local/bin/mrun   and then the subsequent lines in the script are just straight C++.  The mrun program strips the #! line off of the beginning, compiles to a temp file, executes, and then cleans up the temp file upon completion.
[02:21:08] <InPhase> rty: I wrote it because I found it "neat".  I confess I've pretty much never used it, because it is only conceptually neat, and I struggled to find practical utility.  But I like that it can be done.  :)
[02:22:53] <InPhase> rty: What you end up with is basically C++ as a scripting language, but where the script startup times are a little laggy.
[02:23:22] <InPhase> C++ is also a terrible scripting language unless you include a bunch of libraries to help, at which point the startup times get worse.
[02:24:19] <rty> yea. but just like python vm can compile files into .pyc bytecode, it is possible to do a primitive stat check between source file and a .o file, the latter being somewhere in /tmp, and speed it up :)
[02:24:23] <InPhase> rty: What would probably help as an upgrade to this, but I never bothered with, is caching compiled versions.
[02:24:34] <InPhase> Right.
[02:25:11] <rty> in my case I've blowned it up by having it to link to a 32Mb static library, so caching was the first thing I did xD

[12:54:57] <LordKalma> computerquip, if you want to know more, beyond vdamewood's excelent TLDR, https://youtu.be/wULu83jQmIQ?t=2037
[12:55:01] <LordKalma> from that timestamp
[13:00:21] <antto> so, i have a project on gitlab, i've sploshed a "COPYING.gpl-3.0.txt" in the root dir, is that effective enough?
[13:00:55] <antto> what else is needed, do i put license and/or copyright or other text in each .hpp/.cpp as well?
[13:01:13] <antto> or other additional files
[13:01:50] <LordKalma> https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html
[13:01:50] <LordKalma> " If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms." "To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
[13:01:51] <LordKalma> effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. "
[13:01:53] <LordKalma> you decide
[13:02:27] <LordKalma> It is -safest-, not mandatory, so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[13:02:53] <antto> it's not a program, it's my sort-of library for baremetal arm
[13:03:13] <antto> so mostly .hpp files
[13:04:09] <LordKalma> Read the definitions: "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
[13:14:59] <ville> antto: if it's a library then lgpl may be the way to go. if it's a progrma than agpl may be the way to go. as far as how to publicize your choice. i'd have an explicit "license" section simply stating: "this project uses XYZ license for code" in readme. so it's not burried in ton of text. on top of that have "license" file with the full text of the chosen license{,s}.
[13:15:31] *** Joins: gentooclimax (~gentoocli@81-64-65-213.rev.numericable.fr)
[13:18:07] <ville> antto: including the license in comment in the source files seems to be popular choice. i guess if someone is actively ripping off code from your project for a long period of time they will maybe forced to spend effort to removing that repeatedly or automate it
[13:19:31] <ville> antto: rather than including the whole license it would be more of an abbreviated version of it. sticking the whole text of agpl at the beginning of every source file seems excessive
[13:21:27] *** Joins: jsbach (~jsbach@2a01:c23:60ca:b800:23f:a914:574a:afa3)
[13:21:47] <Shell> ville: there's a standard header for source files included in the GPL. the GPL does have a whole section on how to apply the GPL to your software.
[13:22:18] <Shell> "How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs" at the bottom of the license text.

[13:27:23] <antto> nonono, i'm not putting the whole GPL text in the .hpp

[13:47:07] <ville> serious as in money-serious

[13:50:59] <ville> quality doesn't really matter. there're always lot of people looking to copypasta their way out instead of writing something
[13:51:35] <antto> it probably has bugs too
[13:52:03] <LordKalma> yes, if you keep the git history, anyone can fork at "gpl3-time"
[13:52:53] <antto> can the git history can be bleached?
[13:52:53] <ville> i wonder if you could retroactively legally change the license, even if git doesn't have the functionality
[13:53:12] <ville> just nuke the .git dir!
[13:53:14] <LordKalma> yes it can
[13:53:26] <LordKalma> (and then force push)
[13:53:34] <antto> the .git dir on gitlab or on my local copy?

[13:53:48] <LordKalma> this is the right way to do it
[13:53:55] <LordKalma> (but what ville said works)
[13:54:04] <antto> aww git commands x_x
[13:54:07] <ville> you can nuke the .git-dir locally, then i'd just remake the project on gitlab, if it's not been public
[13:54:10] * antto uses "git gui"
[13:54:31] <LordKalma> rm -rf .git; re-initialize the repo, and force push
[13:54:33] <LordKalma> not that hard
[13:54:38] <antto> i don't wanna loose the gitlab settings
