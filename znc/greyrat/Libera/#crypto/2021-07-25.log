[06:37:59] <JollyRoger> I just read that JavaCard v3.1 will be supporting ed25519. I'm quite stoked for this, but at this moment it looks like there are no smartcards that support v3.1 that I can buy. Really hoping that they'll make some J3H145-DI cards that will support v3.1. At the same time though I've kind of wondered why they won't also add X448 at the same time, since it'd require less memory than RSA4096, which the
[06:38:01] <JollyRoger> cards support, but offer greater psychological assurance.
[06:38:22] <JollyRoger> But I guess the standard's been made, so it's been made, that ship has sailed, I suppose.

[06:49:21] <JollyRoger> In unrelated news I just remembered it's been a year and two days to this day that the Third Round Candidates for PQC Standardization have been selected and they're now down to only four key exchange mechanisms, and only three signature schemes. I get the impression that this is gonig to take the longest time of them all.
[06:49:38] <JollyRoger> Well, not counting the Alternate Candidates.
[06:53:01] <onelegend> yo JollyRoger 
[06:53:05] <JollyRoger> Ahoy!
[06:53:32] <onelegend> it's the grapheneOS dev!
[06:53:53] <JollyRoger> Hahaha! Oh, no no no, you flatter me. I'm not a developer, not yet.
[06:55:18] <JollyRoger> Just a learner and someone interested in security/privacy. What can I do for ya? 
[07:11:56] <onelegend> JollyRoger: how do you make a plan for learning about security?
[07:13:38] <JollyRoger> onelegend: I'd probably say the same way I'd go about learning anything. Start with the basics, and then gradually try to expand my own understanding, seek out good, qualified mentors who can help me on my way...
[07:15:17] <JollyRoger> I think the important thing it took me a while to realize was not to try to start learning about security, but rather to start with the process of learning about computers at an abstract level, technologies like networking, operating systems... so then when security enters the mixture, to have a good foundation to build on.

[07:16:57] <JollyRoger> I made the mistake of trying to skip that step and start learning about security from day one early on, and I'm glad I changed that philosophy fast, because it's easy to end up trying to skip the basics and foundations and go straight to learning about security, and the problem I had with doing that was that all I was ending up learning to do was to learn to "make sacrifices to the machine god":
[07:16:58] <JollyRoger> "do this, then do this, then follow this how to" without knowing what I was doing or what the tradeoffs really were.
[07:17:04] <JollyRoger> Or what I was really doing.
[07:20:25] <JollyRoger> I'm wishing I'd made that shift in logic earlier. It would've saved me a lot of time, and a lot of effort, and a ton of spent money and energy I wasted on learning to make sacrifices to the machine god from influencers and snake oil sellers.

[16:57:09] <yawkat> but maybe i was remembering efail
[16:57:20] <Peng> no, your thing sounds vaguely familiar
[17:03:04] <Peng> Was it something about Enigmail not checking exit code, or gpg using 0? Or that gpg just displayed the error message and the data, and Enigmail failed to check for the error message?
[17:03:17] <yawkat> something like that
[17:03:47] <rqsd> I mean it's already an admission of defeat when things rely on parsing command line output and exit codes of unrelated third-party processes because actually handling PGP is too hard

[17:46:16] <MacGyver> Enigmail (in fact, many more than enigmail) consumers ignoring the auth error was part of the victim-blaming that GPG did in response to efail.
[17:47:15] <MacGyver> Efail was basically two things:
[17:47:30] <MacGyver> - S/MIME clients are screwed.
[17:47:37] <MacGyver> - Enigmail and friends are ignoring auth errors.
