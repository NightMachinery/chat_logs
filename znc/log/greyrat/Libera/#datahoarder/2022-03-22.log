[02:53:43] <rawktucc> fuck me. my ISP is doing traffic shaping I think?
[02:54:09] <rawktucc> im not sure why doing file transfers over SSH crawls, but when routing over a private wireguard VPN to a 10gbit server I get normal speeds
[02:54:12] <rawktucc> packet loss?
[02:59:47] <sarnold> rawktucc: this reminds me a lot of an issue a pal was telling me about..
[03:00:05] <sarnold> rawktucc: openssh was setting unexpected QoS flags that one of the cloud providers was just dropping..
[03:00:29] <sarnold> rawktucc: you may have something similar -- check the 'ipqos' thing mentioned here https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6110581 -- and try fiddling around with different qos settings for your ssh traffic
[03:01:21] <rawktucc> interesting, but the thing is, this has worked fine for months now, and only today for some reason the connection keeps dropping slowly but surely
[03:01:25] <rawktucc> when over a clear connection
[03:04:14] <rawktucc> additionally, it goes nice and fast over a VPN connection
[03:05:02] <sarnold> oh interesting
[03:05:22] <sarnold> I wonder if someone along the way upgraded a device that now does qos when it didn't before, or the other way around, hehe
[03:06:45] <rawktucc> so checking a wireshark capture shows nothing
[03:06:49] <rawktucc> no dsfield

[03:08:41] <rawktucc> there's some packet loss at a twelve99 provider, fucking hate those guys

[03:08:59] <rawktucc> but this could be ICMP packet discards
[03:10:17] <rawktucc> and there's no way they'd see what im actually moving because 1. ssh encryption 2. rclone encryption

[03:23:09] <ThePendulum> plane crash
[03:23:11] <rawktucc> plane crash in china
[03:23:16] <superkuh> Oh. Wow.
[03:23:50] <ThePendulum> and idk, they figured out China Airlines flight 611, 006, 120, Air China Flight 129, 140.... I am not going to fly on a Chinese airline, I think
[03:24:00] <sarnold> damn I've never seen so little plane left over from a plane crash... though that one that just went missing, that's a condidate..
[03:24:23] <ThePendulum> since it's an American plane, the NTSB will get involved, I do think China will let them, they might publish their own findings if the NTSB suggests pilot error or malice though

[03:24:39] <ThePendulum> what comes to mind is that plane that crashed in a field on 9/11
[03:24:53] <ThePendulum> this should settle some of those conspiracy theorists that didn't believe a plane could just vaporize. not that they will

[03:34:59] <ThePendulum> hm I should probably tell my dad, he's uploaded a bunch of stuff to vimeo because he didn't like youtube claiming ownership of the video
[03:35:08] <ThePendulum> which afaik they don't really, at least not the way facebook does
[03:35:29] <ThePendulum> what they do is reserve the right to use your video in promotional material, but afaik they can't stop you from doing whatever you want with it
[03:35:34] <rawktucc> yes, please do
[03:35:38] <rawktucc> you want me to download it right now?
[03:35:41] <rawktucc> PM me a link
[03:36:11] <rawktucc> your dad probably has access to grab their uploaded copy though, just like on youtube everything is recompressed
[03:36:16] <ThePendulum> he still has the originals afaik
[03:36:52] <rawktucc> then might as well just grab vimeo description files with youtube-dl
[03:38:05] <ThePendulum> he doesn't really have a major channel or anything, I guess it's not too urgent?
[03:38:17] <rawktucc> I'm not sure but it sure sems like vimeo is on the way out
[03:38:25] <rawktucc> $3500 a YEAR? that's stupid
[03:38:43] <rawktucc> you can rent an SX134 and run your own video server with peertube, plain mp4 streaming

[03:39:21] <ThePendulum> hm, where do you watch peertube?
[03:39:40] <rawktucc> I don't personally. Haven't found any specific channels or programs I'm really interested in
[03:39:45] <rawktucc> it's all on youtube ironically...
[03:39:48] <ThePendulum> I click the first video on their content selection list and the link's dead, d'oh
[03:39:59] <rawktucc> really?
[03:40:10] <ThePendulum> https://joinpeertube.org/
[03:40:12] <ThePendulum> the nothing to hide one
[03:40:20] <ThePendulum> ah so it seems like you have a bunch of independent client sites
[03:40:40] <rawktucc> oh
[03:40:54] <rawktucc> where is the video, i just get "The hacker wars"
[03:40:59] <rawktucc> ThePendulum, ? what do you mean
[03:41:17] <rawktucc> or if you mean peertube, yes that's what it's like
[03:41:24] <rawktucc> lots of small independent sites interlinking through federation
[03:41:33] <ThePendulum> it seems to regenerate, on some page loads I get a video "Nothing to Hide" that links to https://media.zat.im/videos/watch/35badfed-5322-48ac-b5c1-71b1ad88262e
[03:41:54] <ThePendulum> https://i.imgur.com/hxQ2eLK.png
[03:42:02] <rawktucc> I got it now, thanks yeah I should have refreshed
[03:42:31] <ThePendulum> I figured it was like torrents where you can't really break a video by removing one server
[03:44:18] <rawktucc> sort of, but that other server would have to have a stored copy
[03:44:31] <rawktucc> I would say it's more like DHT for torrents, where you can find another peer from a peer you're connected to
[03:44:34] <rawktucc> or in this case, video
[03:44:40] <ThePendulum> right ok
[03:44:52] <rawktucc> You are on peertubevideos.com, you see nothing to hide on zim.im, and you click that link on peertubevideos, it just calls the data from zim.im
[03:45:05] <rawktucc> you'd see it in stuff like ublock or umatrix, it'd be another URL appearing in the host list
[03:48:08] <ThePendulum> lol rip https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOYmINNXIAA3g0P?format=jpg&name=medium
[03:49:51] <rawktucc> i think peertube is a fantastic concept, idea, and it works well overall. but realistically separation of content is a killer
[03:49:53] <sarnold> "jw"?
[03:50:03] <rawktucc> it's why wiimmfi is probably better run as some closed source software
[03:52:55] <rawktucc> im actually worried about all the very cool movies on vimeo that would be lost if it went offline
[03:53:03] <rawktucc> you can buy movies there, i forgot about that
[03:54:06] <sarnold> a few years ago I supported a nichtlustig kickstarter project, and they sent me a dvd that I can't watch in my region.. the vimeo versions of those videos is the 'easy' way to watch them, but because it's vimeo, it was never actually easy to watch them..
[03:54:22] <rawktucc> Dammit! a video i wanted is GONE
[03:55:24] <sarnold> :(

[07:30:50] <skye0> and why was i looking at cars i couldn't afford earlier?
[07:31:15] <sarnold> because it's traditional
[07:31:16] <skye0> i likely don't need to drive most of the time but do plan on using my own transport for moving out (and may need it depending on the jobs I'm applying for if they're far)
[07:31:23] <skye0> traditional?
[07:31:34] <sarnold> yeah, everyone always looks at nicer cars than they can afford
[07:32:02] <skye0> i likely can't afford a car, and i've just started booking an appointment for some rather expensive private therapy
[07:32:12] <skye0> and i'm planning to start learning to drive too
[07:32:15] <sarnold> sweet, good job :)
[07:32:46] <skye0> even though i don't feel ready but i need it just for proof of ID, for moving out and for the awkward case when public transport will fail me (which it shouldn't most of the time thankfully enough)
[07:33:18] <skye0> been looking at EVs. the cheapest ones don't have a lot of room to haul shit around but at the same time it's likely to be a one-off thing for me to do
[07:34:21] <skye0> if i do manage to move out i'm wondering how i could keep paying for a car. EVs appeal to me in a way because not just of reduced gas dependency but also because it'll be a lot less of a headache to be totally exempt from like congestion charges and the like
[07:34:40] <skye0> in short they seem simpler to run apart from the initial steep cost for even owning one
[07:34:54] <sarnold> so many fewer moving parts..
[07:35:09] <skye0> with regards to the paperwork at least. range anxiety, depending on the model and how i use the car, can be a thing still
[07:35:59] <skye0> yup, because they're just big batteries with big motors with seats, brakes and suspension and other car parts attached to them
