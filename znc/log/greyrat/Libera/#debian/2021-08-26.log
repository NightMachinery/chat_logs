[00:05:50] <bgardner> I guess the graphics card could be at issue, but I don't use it for more than running a vanilla KDE.  No games or anything.
[00:06:28] <n4dir> you could try a WM to get at least KDE out of the way being the culprit
[00:07:23] <n4dir> i tend to also create a testuser and check if it might be some config i don't have in mind.
[00:07:46] <n4dir> both ain't my first guess in this case though
[00:07:47] <bgardner> Honestly, I could just remove X outright and run a console only.  It really is a server, I just use the browser to check email.  That'd remove a bunch of variables.
[00:08:28] <jhutchins> bgardner: KDE is suspect - too many moving parts.  My advice for wierd time-based problems is to re-seat all cards, modules, and cables.

[01:03:20] <Emil> why isn't localisation tied to the keyboard?
[01:03:33] <Mr_Queue> How could it be?
[01:03:53] <Emil> If I as a user select to boot with localisation support and select finnish, my Finnish keyboard should work straight, it shouldn't be us layout

[01:04:36] <blissful> Mr_Queue: this came pre-installed with ubuntu, would it be simpler to find a live usb that boots and run debootstrap that way, or do it on the installed ubuntu system (unsure how)?

[01:10:52] <pasiz> Emil: so when your gnome opens, you cannot select keyboard?
[01:11:45] <pasiz> n4dir: they are not installers, installer is initiated after live is booted
[01:12:10] <n4dir> uh. well. usually you don't install debian with a live-image
[01:12:42] <n4dir> and if you do, i seem to recall the live images use a different installer then the debian-installer
[01:12:53] <pasiz> i never install with those, but i have some understanding how the system works
[01:13:10] <pasiz> so in live environment, you fire up settings and select your keyboard
[01:13:32] <pasiz> cannot understand what is the culprit

[02:18:32] <greatgatsby> I'm grepping many many times for various things, the setup time doesn't matter
[02:18:38] <jhutchins> greatgatsby: consider that you are asking grep to process every character of every file.  It's gonna take time.
[02:19:10] <jhutchins> greatgatsby: Think of us old farts who had to submit the card deck, then come back for the printout the next day.
[02:19:11] <greatgatsby> sure, of course, but I'm trying to optimize this.  In-memory filesystem, different filesyste (reiser?).  
[02:19:19] <Blondie101010> greatgatsby:  if you ignore setup time and have enough RAM to put it there, then it should go *much* faster
[02:20:19] <greatgatsby> Blondie101010, the problem is it doesn't, at least in my very limited testing... I was expecting a very noticeable speedup, but didn't see any

[02:20:50] <Blondie101010> but that's certain

[04:23:26] <PMT> (Historically, when I've used ddrescue with a logfile, I believe I expect it to have noticed there was an issue with reading at the end of its current log and try starting at an offset and going back - if it's not skipping far enough, you could force it to go larger, or if it's not skipping at all, you could manually insert a "this errored" entry at the end to make it doso. You could also try using -O to make 
[04:23:32] <PMT> it reopen the device on error, but closing it will probably result in it vanishing at that point, so it's a question of whether you can convince the OS to make the disk reappear...)
[04:24:32] <bozra> ws2k3: could also be a controler error (try another port) but who has that luck
[04:24:53] <PMT> that is true, but would be slightly surprising for me to see fail quite this reliably.

[04:30:42] <PMT> well, like i said, you could hope it doesn't fall off again because it was just an issue with one or two areas, or you could play with ddrescue -O and poking the system to try and make the disk reappear, or ratelimiting it like the person above suggested (I've never had to do that, though, so I can't speak to it helping)

[07:41:53] <gordonfish> Question. How exactly does `apt --purge autoremove` determine what to remove? I was doing a buster->bullseye upgrade on a dragonbox pyra (an armhf based mini Linux laptop), which came with debian buster, with all the stop deb repos plus a pyra specific one.
[07:42:06] <Powerhouse6666> PMT, sweet! firewalld installed - nwo to remember how to open the ports lol
[07:42:17] <Powerhouse6666> PMT, activate services I should say
[07:42:49] <gordonfish> For some reason, `apt --purge autoremove` after full-upgrade'ing and rebooting, decides to remove a whole bunch of pyra packages:
[07:42:49] <gordonfish> pyra-config-all*
[07:42:49] <gordonfish>   pyra-config-initramfs* pyra-config-pulseaudio* pyra-config-systemd* pyra-icon-theme* pyra-lightdm-theme* pyra-mate-theme*
[07:42:49] <gordonfish>   pyra-slim-theme* pyra-themes*

[07:43:01] <gordonfish> oops, sorry about that
[07:43:11] <gordonfish> didn't mean to paste the whole line
[07:43:53] <gordonfish> But among those, pyra-config-initramfs being removed lead to a system that was unable to boot until I fixed it in initramfs.
[07:44:28] <gordonfish> So what would cause `apt --purge autoremove` to choose those, among all the expected stuff, for removal? What should I look for?
[07:45:27] <gordonfish> I was talking with people in their channel and it's a known problem, but it hasn't been sorted out yet so I thought I would ask here so that I could help them.
[07:45:42] <PMT> well, autoremove, I believe, picks "not marked important and not manually installed and not depended on by anything"
[07:45:53] <PMT> (I'm not confident about the first of those three)
[07:46:41] *** Joins: craigevil (craig@user/craigevil)
[07:48:03] <gordonfish> PMT: Really? I would have thought there'd be more to it. Clearly these packages were being used and not out of date or anything. Some of them are critical to the system (like system hardware specific startup scripts, things of that nature.)
[07:48:31] <PMT> gordonfish: "clearly" how? they're not marked manually installed, so that implies they were installed automatically to satisfy something's dependencies, and can be removed if nothing depends on them any more.
[07:49:33] <PMT> My guess knowing nothing about pyra would be that there was something installed that got removed or replaced during full-upgrade that pulled in all the pyra packages for you, and with it gone, they were no longer depended on.
[07:49:49] <gordonfish> (The pyra-config-initramfs one was a real dozey, as it has the scripts that handle the switching between the internal emmc and microsd for boot storage, and without it uses the wrong one, which made the system unbootable until I switched it manually in a initramfs shell and was able to continue the boot and reinstall the whole lot.
[07:49:51] <gordonfish> )
[07:50:33] <gordonfish> PMT: I don't quite get the "nothing depends on them" as a criteria, there are plenty of stand alone packages out there, no?
[07:50:37] <PMT> My more specific guess would be that pyra ships something in their custom repos that overrides a normal Debian package, but then the package in bullseye was newer.
[07:50:53] <PMT> gordonfish: sure, but you manually installed those.
[07:51:37] *** Joins: schmillin_ (~schmillin@user/schmillin)
[07:52:32] <gordonfish> PMT: Well originally they came installed, though I'm sure they were originally 'sudo apt install'ed, just like I did to install them back.
[07:52:57] <gordonfish> I also manually installed many standalone packages (sudo apt install ...) in general and I didn't see those marked for removal.
[07:54:20] <PMT> gordonfish: if you have a backup, it would be interesting to see what the state of things was before. But my guess would be, as I said, that they were all automatically installed as deps by a package they overrode that got replaced with a vanilla version (or just one that didn't do that Depends dance), et voila.
[07:54:59] <PMT> Do they have an apt repo somewhere I could look at?

[13:15:38] <Khepra> SymbioticFemale: do you have resolvconf package installed?
[13:15:52] <ecraven> SymbioticFemale: not a good solution, but I've done chattr +i to make it immutable, after setting it exactly as I like it
[13:15:59] <ecraven> that way, nothing actually modifies it
[13:16:00] <Khepra> no, that's a hack
[13:16:04] <Khepra> needless hack, btw. 
[13:16:19] <SymbioticFemale> Khepra: not installed, no
[13:16:31] <SymbioticFemale> ecraven: thats my backup plan
[13:16:33] <Khepra> SymbioticFemale: can you pastebin your NetworkManager.conf please?
[13:16:44] <ecraven> Khepra: some (stupid) vpn clients want to change that file, and have no switch to prevent it. networkmanager can probably be persuaded to do this properly, yes ;)
[13:17:17] <SymbioticFemale> Khepra: [main] plugins=ifupdown,keyfile ; [ifupdown] managed=false
[13:17:37] <Khepra> SymbioticFemale: so where did you put dns=none?
[13:17:53] <Khepra> it goes under the [main] section of NetworkManager.conf
[13:18:10] <SymbioticFemale> Khepra: [main] #dns=none ; rc-manager=unmanaged
[13:18:20] <SymbioticFemale> i tried dns=none and rc-manager=unmanaged
[13:18:42] <SymbioticFemale> both did something, which was not to put anything other than "#Managed by NetworkManager" in the file
[13:18:52] <SymbioticFemale> but it still overwrites the file just to taunt me
[13:18:56] <Khepra> can you actually pastebin the file? you're giving contradicting info which is also hard to read in single line. please pastebin, you might have a syntax error
[13:19:12] <SymbioticFemale> Khepra: it's not a single file and there is no syntax error
[13:19:22] <Khepra> would you kindly pastebin it anyway, please?
[13:20:15] <SymbioticFemale> ya but then i'm going to immediately use the chattr +i after

Now with bullseye, obmenu is no longer available in the repository. i see some openbox distro's move to jgmenu, but is there any security risk for me doing: 1) install debian buster with obmenu -> 2) upgrade to bullseye?

[18:21:15] <edufmass> Hello! Can I have any trouble if I install the system without recommends/suggests packages ? net install, X, a wm, browser, kvm..
[18:24:19] <Khepra> edufmass: you might
[18:24:43] <bozra> edufmass: no you can alway install again :P

[18:24:58] <PMT> i believe the definition of it is that you will likely be missing functionality people will notice without the recommends, but it should still work for many things. So it should still work, but you might be missing random features.

[18:31:27] <n4dir> edufmass: that depends on what what you consider "problems". For sure nothing serious. But some packages might not work as expected (many would though). 
[18:31:53] <n4dir> i for one never bothered to not install recommends per default, and whichever distro has that setting, i undo it
[18:32:17] <n4dir> really many do it though.

[18:34:44] <edufmass> n4dir, maybe I'm wrong, but I used arch sometime ago and installing xorg uses a few packages, debian install many devices packages, videos, etc. I thought withuot recommends it will be more lightweight 
[18:35:38] <n4dir> you could skip xorg and install only the parts you need. I forgot the details. Good example where i just use the quick solution (though here it is more of a metapackage than a recommends issue, i think)
[18:36:56] <greycat> Most people don't particularly care that they have a few unused packages sitting on their disks.  The time it takes to micromanage the dependencies is more important to them than the extra disk space being used.
[18:37:17] <greycat> So, for those people, "apt install xorg my-favorite-wm" is perfect.
[18:37:26] <n4dir> and the size of xorg is what? 100 MB? probably even less?

[18:42:07] <edufmass> nice, I think I'm being a perfectionist with something so simple, is just some extra mb lol
[18:42:23] <n4dir> anyway, edufmass, you can just try and see for yourself. Fool around with either not installing recommends per default or make it an argument to apt(-get,itude). The problems which might occur are quickly solved by installing the recommends "manually"
[18:43:31] <Khepra> edufmass: it's not just about space; see the smartmontools -> exim example I gave above
[18:43:58] <n4dir> back a decade at formums.debian a few were around always fiddling with "make it small, make it ressource-low". Not that sure if those threads still worth it (and still can be found)
[18:45:26] <greycat> The biggest single package on my system is fonts-noto-extra at 334238 kB.  It's bigger than kernels, web browsers, etc.  The biggest package that is "obviously" part of X.org (apart from lib* which has an 'x' in it) is libx11-doc at 10373 kB.  And then mesa-vdpau-drivers at 9963 kB.
[18:45:51] <PMT> you know what's bigger than those? kernel debug symbols. :)
[18:45:56] <n4dir> greycat: audio soundfonts can be outstanding huge :-)

[23:15:06] <teus> hi, wordpress is nagging me to upgrade PHP to 7.4 . i'm now on 7.3 . why should 7.4 be installed from a separate repository?
[23:15:43] <sney> you don't have to take wordpress's advice if you don't want to
[23:15:55] *** Joins: noarb (~noarb@user/noarb)
[23:15:58] <PMT> You can get PHP 7.4 in bullseye without a third-party repo.
[23:16:00] <sney> but to answer your question, debian stable releases have 1 version of major software, including php. 
[23:16:17] <greycat> ... usually.
[23:16:25] <teus> i see bullseye was released just recently, so i assume that has 7.4 then
[23:16:47] <sney> buster has 7.3, bullseye has 7.4, ondrej sury (the debian php maintainer) has a semi-unofficial extra repository with some extra php versions in it as well 
[23:17:11] <teus> aha, i see. interesting, one version of major software like that. i'll remember that, thanks

[23:19:53] <greycat> It's not unusual for a given version of Debian to offer 2 separate versions of a given thing.  Python is one of the most common instances of this.
