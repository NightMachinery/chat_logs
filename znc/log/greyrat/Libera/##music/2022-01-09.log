[21:43:52] <nativetexan> lol
[21:46:16] <Panther> Actually, I think I mentioned... my ex-fiancee never liked to put the decorations away, so there was one room that was always decorated for every holiday at the same time all year. :)
[21:46:49] <nativetexan> hehe
[21:47:01] <nativetexan> yeah, i've seen that in homes as well
[21:47:21] <Panther> Fortunately I managed to contain it to one room. :)

[21:49:48] <Panther> Our house was strange in that the 2nd floor was 2 suites and a bathroom, so we lived in one, and used the other as storage and a guest room.
[21:50:19] <nativetexan> i like large bedrooms
[21:50:50] <Panther> I do too, tho, they seem hard to find these days.
[21:52:47] <Panther> The nedroom here is kinda small, but it has part of the wall opened to the rest of the living room, so it doesn't seem so closed in.
[21:52:51] <nativetexan> that was a tasty jam, i'll add it to my list

[21:58:34] <louipc> just enough for a bed and something
[21:58:41] <nativetexan> you are in a nice location Panther, i'd give up space for your location
[21:59:40] <Panther> The queen size bed takes up a lot of space, and then there is a bookcase, a nightstand, and a few other things.

[23:40:19] <nativetexan> hehe, after i graduated high school, mom came up to me and said, i'm moving to atlanta and you're not
[23:40:29] <Panther> heh
[23:40:33] <Panther> hmm
[23:40:41] <nativetexan> so i went into construction
