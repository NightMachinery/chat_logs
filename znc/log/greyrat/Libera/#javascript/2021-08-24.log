[00:00:25] <celphi> but works with curl so it cant be a server issue
[00:01:16] <silly> paste the error message
[00:01:46] <celphi> it seems i only get an error when i add the header `"Content-Type":"application/json", `

[00:02:44] <silly> i mean response headers...
[00:02:54] <celphi> sure sec
[00:03:32] <celphi> so on first one where it says CORS error- there's no response header
[00:04:02] <silly> do you need authentication for this request?
[00:04:34] <silly> or authorization or w/e
[00:05:16] <celphi> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/hVlq3kej/image.png
[00:05:27] <celphi> is from the 2nd one
[00:05:32] <celphi> no authentication
[00:08:46] <silly> weird that it says 404
[00:09:29] <celphi> no idea what "preflight" means either

[00:22:31] <systemfault> An error should be visible in the network tab
[00:22:32] <celphi> works but if i add the content-type header it doesnt
[00:22:48] <celphi> yeah systemfault you see my image 10mins ago?
[00:22:51] <systemfault> Yes, simple requests don't need a preflight request
[00:23:18] <systemfault> Nope, I only look at the window 4-5 times an hour... because work :/
[00:23:54] <celphi> ok so right now-- if i make my server reply with json_encode([4]) it works by replying with [4] but if i try to json_encode($_REQUEST) i get an empty array as if the data is not posting right
[00:24:43] <systemfault> celphi: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request
[00:25:05] <systemfault> By changing the header, you go from a simple request to a preflighted one.
[00:25:38] <celphi> i see
[00:25:39] <systemfault> So, fix your backend... properly handle OPTIONS request.

[00:59:39] <systemfault> Normally, <script>s block when they're loaded... so if the DOM element their code targets are not loaded at that point in time, it won't work
[00:59:42] <seed0> cthulchu: from my understanding, it's about order, deferred scripts are only loaded after all other resources are loaded (html, css, other non-deferred scripts). Async scripts are different in that they are loaded as soon as theyre finished downloading
[00:59:55] <seed0> oops
[00:59:56] <seed0> lol
[00:59:59] <systemfault> "defer" will push the execution of those blocks after all the DOM is parsed.
[00:59:59] <seed0> systemfault: got this
[01:00:04] <cthulchu> no, I want something more certain
[01:00:17] <cthulchu> systemfault, parsed? so after dom ready?
[01:00:27] <cthulchu> after it's rendered and available for JS?
[01:00:34] <systemfault> "defer" will ensure that all the deferred blocks will be run in the order they were in the document.... "async" doesn't give a shit about order
[01:00:41] <seed0> ^
[01:00:45] <seed0> well said
[01:00:54] <cthulchu> then how is it different from sync?
[01:01:17] <systemfault> cthulchu: sync? You mean "normally"?
[01:01:22] <cthulchu> ye
[01:01:35] <systemfault> The code is executed when it's encountered
[01:01:46] <cthulchu> and in sync?
[01:02:18] <austincheney> my preferred approach is to shovel everything into a callback that fires on an event, such as the load event, and checks that a flag is set in the page validating everything is parsed and ready
[01:03:24] <systemfault> cthulchu: Maybe I should have been more clear about something hmm..

[01:03:29] <cthulchu> ok, so deferred implies async download, but execution is on dom ready I think
[01:03:36] <systemfault> Yes.
[01:04:04] <cthulchu> so if my script heavily parses DOM, then defer is a good way to ensure there's no racing with DOM
[01:04:15] <systemfault> There's never racing.
[01:04:55] <systemfault> When the page is loaded, normally, all script tags block the page while their content is loaded

[04:54:00] <theskillwithin> btw [`${currVal}`]   can be just [currVal]   probably
[04:54:32] <theskillwithin> ArchNoob I think whats happening here, is in your for loop, you are performing a return.  so it will never get past the first iteration cuz when you return to the reduce it moves onto the next
[04:55:09] <theskillwithin> see what i mean?
[04:55:21] <ArchNoob> I do.. thought of it too.
[04:55:57] <ArchNoob> and sure, [currVal] lol, there was somemore logic there and I changed it to just `currVal`

[08:44:25] <sheetjs> the behavior, however, most likely should've been

[08:47:03] <theskillwithin> sheetjs thats really hard to read, cuz of the '"'

[08:47:23] <sheetjs> the specification includes a pascal snippet of code

[08:47:58] <theskillwithin> the '"' is a ' then " then '   right?
[08:48:04] <sheetjs> that code checks if the first character is a double-quote.  if it is, it matches up to the second double-quote
[08:48:04] <theskillwithin> or is it ""
[08:48:15] <sheetjs> as an example of the confusion
[08:48:31] <sheetjs> Excel encodes a double-quote as """" (4 " characters)

[08:48:54] <Rockwood> bye cya
[08:48:58] <Rockwood> my office time
[08:48:59] <sheetjs> so according to the pascal code, """" is actually an empty string
[08:49:11] <sheetjs> it matches from the first " to the second "
[08:49:41] <sheetjs> the english text of the specification does not explain how to encode double-quotes within strings

[09:02:58] <theskillwithin> double-double is also my in-n-out order
[09:04:04] <sheetjs> so for example, `1,0\r\n""""\r\n` encodes a string value `"`
[09:05:21] <sheetjs> for a time when disk space and memory was at a premium, this format is particularly wasteful
[09:05:22] <theskillwithin> btw in-n-out is a hamburger restaurant on the west coast
[09:06:22] <sheetjs> there are a few in las vegas
[09:07:52] <theskillwithin> that seems like a lot for just "
[09:08:28] <sheetjs> any string that contains non-alphanumeric characters must be wrapped in quotes

[09:09:18] <theskillwithin> ahh
[09:09:19] <theskillwithin> ic
[09:09:39] <sheetjs> CSV limits it to 3 characters: double-quotes, the row-separator and the field-separator

[10:27:58] <cheater> i can hear you furiously googling that

[12:09:17] <thykka> would that not depend on cache headers?
[12:09:28] <cthulchu> as in document.createElement("script")
[12:10:27] *** Joins: ArchNoob (~maotora@user/archnoob)
[12:12:30] <cthulchu> well cache headers are requests. browsers can ignore those
[12:12:41] <cthulchu> for now, I'm just appending a query param to the url
[12:12:51] <cthulchu> changing the value of it on every build.
[12:12:58] <thykka> why would it ignore them?
[12:13:23] <silly_> they could if they wanted
[12:13:33] <thykka> :I
[12:13:34] <silly_> but browsers have no free will
[12:15:17] <thykka> cthulchu, in any case, why would caching have anything to do with how the resource ends up being used?
[12:15:38] <cthulchu> what?
[12:15:47] <cthulchu> I didn't get that question
[12:15:53] <thykka> surely you're first requesting the script, and then adding it to DOM, so the way it's added to DOM shouldn't have any effect on how it's cached?
[12:17:14] <cthulchu> you're wrong
[12:17:27] *** Quits: ArchNoob (~maotora@user/archnoob) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:17:30] <thykka> well that settles that then
[12:18:02] <cthulchu> after I add the script to DOM, the browser requests it
[12:18:19] <thykka> how can you add a script that hasn't yet been fetched?
[12:18:24] <cthulchu> what
[12:18:42] <cthulchu> by throwing the src attr to the added script obviously?
[12:18:53] <cthulchu> why would I ever want to add a script to DOM if I already have the source
[12:18:57] <cthulchu> I just execute it
[12:19:00] <thykka> right, but that's simply initiating the request, not adding the script. the script gets added once it has loaded
[12:19:18] <silly_> what you add is a script tag, then the browser does its thing behind the scenes
[12:19:25] <cthulchu> exactly
[12:19:37] <cthulchu> I add the tag, then it appears in dom, then the script gets fetched
[12:19:48] <thykka> and you're saying that for some reason the browser doesn't cache in this particular situation?
[12:20:04] <thykka> despite correct cache headers and all
[12:20:13] <silly_> i feel like everything is a special case :(
[12:20:18] <cthulchu> no, I'm asking if that particular situation has a different  caching logic from the default
[12:20:32] <silly_> cthulchu, i hope not
[12:20:38] <silly_> why would it?
[12:20:39] <thykka> yeah, never heard of such a thing
[12:20:44] <cthulchu> I think not too, just wanted to make sure.
[12:20:57] <silly_> it should be treated like any other resource
[12:22:00] <cthulchu> another question!
[12:22:06] <thykka> .next
[12:22:11] <cthulchu> :)
[12:23:40] <cthulchu> is it possible that a piece of JS executes literally inbetween two sync lines of JS? So like I assign 1 to qwe, and on the next line I console.log(qwe) and don't see that 1 cuz inbetween my assignment and logging it got rewritten by a different piece of code. I assume it's not possible due to JS being not multi-threaded, just wanna make sure
[12:24:20] <thykka> it is possible, at least if you're using getters/setters

[14:29:51] <ArchNoob> Hi, I'm trying to get occurance count of pair of object properties & their value in an array of objects but it seems to just run on one pair of property and value please help, here is a fiddle. https://jsfiddle.net/theskillwithin/j1pov46s/
[14:30:40] <DPA> If you have 10.56 and 20.12, and you want to multiply them, in fixed point, you'd do 1056n * 2012n = 2124672n. That would be 212 and 4672 (last 4 digits, because 100 * 100 = 10000)
[14:31:27] <thykka> ArchNoob, hmm, what should the return value look like?
[14:31:39] <ArchNoob> The desired output is {x-1: n, x-2: n, y-1: n, y-2: n} (n - is the number of times the value occurred) where input is [{x: 1, y: 1}, {x: 2, y: 2}]
[14:32:23] *** Joins: wondiws (~Jasper@d57c89aa.static.ziggozakelijk.nl)

[16:29:26] <onizu> Cork: I get the data in php POST when i use the content-type in headers as 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. But then the request body does not work properly
[16:29:37] <thykka> AndreYuhai, also, if you can narrow the targetNode down to something less huge than document.body, that will surely help with performance
[16:29:37] <onizu> Cork: sending JSON
[16:29:49] <Cork> onizu: then it isn't www-form-encoded...
[16:29:57] <onizu> yes
[16:30:02] <Cork> you want application/json
[16:30:13] <AndreYuhai> thykka, what if the node I want is added with JS?
[16:30:30] <onizu> so I think when JSON data is sent via POST, in PHP it is not received in $_POST
[16:30:34] <Cork> onizu: alternatively set the json as a string on a www-for-encoded variable
[16:30:40] <AndreYuhai> do I choose some outer node that's not added with JS?
[16:30:52] <Cork> onizu: ya, cause $_POST only reads www-form-encoded
[16:31:03] <onizu> I see
[16:31:25] <onizu> Cork: how to read the JSON POST data in PHP, any idea?
[16:31:41] <onizu> i found something as:  'php://input'
[16:32:15] <Cork> onizu: either set the json as a www-form-encoded variable or ya file_get_contents
[16:32:33] <thykka> AndreYuhai, yeah, the closest possible node to the one you want to act on
[16:32:45] <onizu> how do I set the json as a www-form-encoded variable?
[16:32:57] <AndreYuhai> thykka, Alright thank you so much!
[16:33:55] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/384
[16:33:57] <Cork> onizu: form = new FormData(); form.append('json', JSON.stringify(jsonData)); fetch(... {... body: form });
[16:34:08] <onizu> Cork: btw, the data i'm trying to send is coming from an html form, and I created a json out of it in JS, as I don't know how to pass the data in the form of www-form-encoded in the request body using fetch()
[16:34:35] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: you want to get mutation.addedNodes[0] to acces the .feedback element, but not mutation.target
[16:34:41] <Cork> onizu: new FormData(document.querySelect('form'))
[16:34:49] <onizu> in jquery form.serialize() used to work.. but I can't use jquery in this case
[16:34:50] <Cork> *Selector
[16:35:05] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, Oh I get it now. Thank you for the snippet! I'll try this in combination with thykka's suggestion
[16:35:11] <hassoon> since mutation.target is merely the body itself, which is the element on which you set the mutation bserver
[16:35:31] <onizu> Cork: ok, trying
[16:37:12] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: and yes, you always want to be careful with mutation observer's high triggering rate, you put a break in the end of the for loop, and you disconnect your observer completely when you have found your element, like here <
[16:37:16] <hassoon> https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/385
[16:37:43] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, but what if there's like a "load more" button that loads more of the same content?
[16:37:59] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: i don't get it
[16:38:01] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, is mutation observer not a good idea then
[16:38:25] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: you mean another upcoming .feedback  ?
[16:38:27] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, what I mean is sometimes you have posts on the page and when you scroll to the bottom there is a button that says "Load More Posts"
[16:38:33] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, yes
[16:38:35] <onizu> Cork: no, that doesn't create a proper body
[16:38:51] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: then in that case you don't have to do observer.disconnect()
[16:38:51] <Cork> onizu: it should
[16:39:34] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: the idea here is just to optimize how you're using mutation observers as mch as possible
[16:39:46] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: don't leave console.log() as well
[16:40:05] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, oh okay. Maybe I could bind the observer to run when a specific button is clicked as well.
[16:40:10] <hassoon> just use it for diagnosis purposes, otherwise you need to comment that in a prod environment
[16:40:32] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, Oh console.log was for experimenting I'll remove it
[16:40:51] <onizu> Cork: https://paste.ee/p/dzJz6  <---- XHR in firefox
[16:41:15] <Cork> that is www-fornm-encoded
[16:41:16] <thykka> onizu, JSON.stringify(Object.entries(new FormData(myFormElement))) <- simple forms can be serialized like this, but if you have array-like inputs, it only considers the last one..
[16:41:18] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: sure if you do know when exactly the new .feedback element(s) is/are going to show up, then it's better to open the mutation observer, then disconnect it
[16:42:15] <AndreYuhai> hassoon, after the initial page load the only way to get more is by clicking a button on the page so I'll bind it to that button. Thank you for the help!
[16:42:32] <onizu> thykka: that for headers with content-type 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' ?
[16:42:54] <onizu> Cork: yes
[16:43:21] <thykka> onizu, no, that would be for application/json
[16:43:27] <hassoon> AndreYuhai: alright, go for it, yw

Is there a way to 'fake' the `document` class that is provided in an actual web browser so
[18:55:07] <ezzieyguywuf> that I can do more of my devolopment in a remote terminal, or do I strictly need to do this in a browser?

[20:55:05] <austincheney> pycurious, the way to go is to progressively introduce new rules to impose more mature decisions in the code
[20:55:09] <systemfault> "YO PPLZ, my Arch desktop using OpenBox runs better with less ressources than Windows!!!!!" -> No shit Sherlock
[20:55:19] <seed0> lol
[20:55:25] <ljharb> pycurious: nothing like that exists that I’m aware of. Eslint can certainly report the number of violations, and there’s a “max warnings” flag
[20:55:46] <ljharb> pycurious: but yes, the solution is to keep your config small, and only enable a rule when you can force everything to pass it
[20:56:08] <ljharb> pycurious: better, make your rules strict but use overrides to loosen them for legacy files, and reduce the overrides over time as you clean them up
[20:56:16] <systemfault> pycurious: Maybe pylint does more than linting? (I don't know)
[20:56:56] <systemfault> In the context of a tool like eslint, I don't personally believe a "score" would make sense

[23:09:14] <Lewix> this is for a third party lib

[23:14:48] <sheetjs> so it isn't axios?
[23:17:22] <sheetjs> Lewix: i'd guess, based on https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-js/blob/master/src/channel.ts#L206 , that you need to do something like sendMessage().then(res => { console.log(res.headers); })

[23:27:24] <ljharb> ezzieyguywuf: because the first one returns the expression and the second doesn't return anything
[23:27:32] <ezzieyguywuf> doy
[23:27:35] <ezzieyguywuf> ljharb: thank you
[23:27:45] <ljharb> ezzieyguywuf: it's equivalent to `(h) => { return h.id === id; }` tho

[23:28:02] <ezzieyguywuf> how can I specify the return type in the lambdo?
[23:28:05] <ezzieyguywuf> *lamda
[23:28:08] <ljharb> JS has no types
[23:28:14] <ezzieyguywuf> blarg, *lambda
[23:28:20] <ezzieyguywuf> ohh, yea I'm doing it in typescript
[23:28:33] <ljharb> (JS functions aren't really lamdas, but that's a different debate)
[23:28:43] <ljharb> in TS, you specify it on the variable you put the arrow function in, i believe
[23:29:22] <ljharb> ezzieyguywuf: but in that case, it's a predicate, so you'd want the type to be something like `(x: unknown) => x is Thing` or whatever
[23:29:23] <sheetjs> its after the parens
[23:29:35] <ljharb> ah k
[23:29:41] <sheetjs> (h: ObjectWithId): boolean => h.id === id
[23:29:47] <Lewix> why would an sdk api not return the headers, I think this is important info . do you agree sheetjs
[23:30:00] <ljharb> ezzieyguywuf: btw TS is a distinct language from JS, not a superset, and you should definitely learn normal JS before trying to write TS.
[23:30:01] <ezzieyguywuf> lowercase `boolean` gives me an error too, it sayes it's a typename
[23:30:28] <ezzieyguywuf> ljharb: hm, I was hoping to just pick up js along the way
[23:30:53] <ljharb> ezzieyguywuf: JS takes skill and rigor to learn, you can't really just "pick it up" when writing "not JS"
[23:31:08] <cis> ljharb: what makes TS not a superset?
[23:31:18] <ljharb> ezzieyguywuf: it's also important to understand where TS fails
[23:31:21] <ljharb> cis: a number of things
[23:31:27] <ljharb> cis: TS can't type all JS, for one
[23:31:38] <sheetjs> Lewix: there's some logic in the API wrapper that potentially does multiple requests
[23:31:39] <ljharb> cis: also, TS generics syntax is ambiguous with valid JS syntax

[23:32:08] <sheetjs> so maybe they decided it best to avoid the confusion altogether and just hide the headers

[23:32:49] <ljharb> cis: the first part includes, TS can't represent null prototypes nor indexable objects with symbol keys
[23:33:27] <ljharb> also `this` in computed class property keys doesn't work in TS, spreading Maps/Sets doesn't work without downlevelIteration (which then transpiles wrong), and a bunch of other things
[23:34:59] <cis> ljharb: interesting, thanks

[23:35:41] <systemfault> In the real world though, I'd probably meet the dev who wrote code like that.. and have a nice talk about writing maintainable code..
[23:36:28] <ljharb> for the syntax one, of course i agree
[23:36:43] <ljharb> the other stuff is quite normal readable code, and perfectly idiomatic stuff in JS
[23:37:14] <ljharb> the syntax one is just in my list to silence the people who go "but but but the *syntax* is a superset, then!" after i point out that the semantics aren't.
[23:37:21] <ljharb> because no, nothing about it is a superset

[23:40:05] <pavonia> How do you usually deal with separation of model and view data in JS client code? Do you use observer patterns and such as you would do in languages like Java? Or just mix everything to keep the code easier?
[23:40:20] <systemfault> In some common contexts, TS is not able to figure out if something is a JSX tag or a generic
[23:40:49] <systemfault> People add an extra comma at the end of the generic parameter as a way to disambiguate
[23:40:51] <ljharb> pavonia: i deal with it by realizing that MVC is actually a really poor pattern, and avoiding it
[23:41:02] <cis> systemfault: ah, I haven't run into that one yet.

[23:42:59] <systemfault> cis: : function a<A>(a: A) { return <B,>() => {}}
[23:43:10] <systemfault> That comma after the B parameter is mandatory
[23:43:34] <systemfault> cis: Proof: https://tsplay.dev/N9JYJm
[23:43:49] <pavonia> ljharb: Why poor? I think for bigger projects it makes sense, but client programs tend to be small usually, so it's probably not worth the trouble
[23:44:28] <ljharb> pavonia: because web apps don't cleanly split into model, view, controller. also is the "view" the server render, or the client behavior? it just doesn't match up
[23:44:33] <cis> systemfault: hah, I'll watch out for that, thanks.
[23:44:44] <ljharb> pavonia: MVC is a backend dev's attempt to organize something they do not understand and are not competent enough to do so
[23:46:17] <pavonia> Maybe view and control are a bit convoluted, but model is usually clearly separated from the others
[23:47:16] <pavonia> At the moment I'm mixing everything in one place, but it feels wrong :p

[23:49:02] <GreenJello> with something like React you don't need a model, but rather object shapes (formalized as interfaces if using TS), and functions that transform them
[23:49:53] <GreenJello> and the approach of defining models as a class tends to be counter-productive
[23:50:04] <GreenJello> it's easier to just work with shapes
[23:51:46] <earendel> i think 'view' is poor when it comes to apps / as opposed to a more static, server controlled website.

[23:55:05] <earendel> apps are (in my world) more like programs running on the client. for which classic mvc model only provides view. while modern apps are more like programs running on a client. not just some server rendered static templates.
[23:55:16] <ljharb> pavonia: i agree, but if it's just "model" then it's not MVC
[23:55:44] <ljharb> pavonia: the reality is that you don't generally propagate the models to the JS code, even when you use them in the backend
[23:56:57] <pavonia> Well, it's model data and visual representation of that data. For example storing references to HTML elements where the model data is stored feels just wrong to me, so I thought about separating that somehow
