[00:02:38] <edgar-rft> I think there are only digital packages for emacs
[00:03:16] <lungaro_> Is it possible to encrypt and decrypt strings in a org file? i'm thinking that it'd be nice to store creds in a file in plain text (encrypted) but only decrypt 'em after asked for a password (or private key)

[02:17:13] <bpalmer> you first have to convert one number to float so that floating point division is triggered; then you can use the ceiling function.

[02:21:54] <bpalmer> if all the types are integer, then integer division is used; if one type is float, then the answer is float and float division is used, etc; if one type is bigfloat, then the answer is bigfloat and bigfloat division is used, etc.

[05:37:09] <lemacs_erc> hi, any suggestions on how can I make text replacement with regex easier? I'm using Swiper, but I use the fuzzy option by default, so I lose the option to filter with regex
[05:40:04] *** Joins: michaelrose (~fuckyou@c-73-83-241-164.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[05:40:35] <lemacs_erc> with that, I mark what I want, then use C-s to open Swiper, M-n to put the selection in it, M-r to enable the literal filter, then M-q to replace
[05:41:08] <lemacs_erc> I also tried the regex-builder and replace-regex, but didn't find a way to integrate them better
[05:41:47] <lemacs_erc> for example, I built a regex with regex-builder that had '\n', but replace-regex didn't understand that, and suggested C-q C-j instead

[11:16:18] <adgtl> Anyway to check what GUI Emacs has picked up for ulimit?
[11:16:29] <adgtl> On terminal when I do `ulimit -n` it says 64000
[11:16:37] <adgtl> Also with eshell in Emacs
[11:16:59] <adgtl> but is there way to check what max file and process limts, GUI emacs has picked up while starting?
[11:19:04] <bpalmer> if you are using an operating system with procfs support, see /proc/$PID/limits where $PID is the process id of your emacs
[11:19:40] <aidalgol> bpalmer: Do any operating systems that have ulimit not also have procfs?
[11:19:42] <adgtl> bpalmer: there is no /proc on macOS right?
[11:19:43] <bpalmer> linux and freebsd usually support procfs, I believe.
[11:19:57] <aidalgol> adgtl: ,TIAS

[11:22:05] <bpalmer> huh, plan 9 supports procfs. I did not realize.
[11:22:29] <bpalmer> OpenBSD dropped support for it, though; interesting.
[11:23:16] <bpalmer> aha, "macOS didn't implement procfs and user space programs have to use sysctl interface..."

[12:16:28] <hpfr> is `(decode-char 'ucs ...)` a no-op if your emacs prefers utf-8? I'm not sure what "decodes to the corresponding Emacs character" means

[12:18:56] <bpalmer> hpfr: so, yes, that should be effectively a no-op.
[12:19:10] <bpalmer> It has nothing with charset preference, however.
[12:19:32] <hpfr> yeah I didn't realize it meant emacs had an internal representation separate from charsets
[12:19:47] <hpfr> awesome, thanks. and are the charset symbols `ucs` and `unicode` the same then?
[12:20:17] <kitzman> Anyone tried metals on windows? I have this god forsaken VM. I managed to build and install it. When I run it from powershell, i get winapi console warnings, in cmd it seems to work, but if i run it lile emacs does (cmd.exe /c metals.bat) there s no stdout/in thing happening
[12:20:21] <bpalmer> Y-y- yeah, sure. I think so, but I should disclaim any expertise.
[12:20:59] <hpfr> I'm guessing they are, based on wikipedia and trying some random chars with both. thanks again

[22:49:10] <acdw> pkal: notmuch
[22:49:28] <pkal> kensanata: But that would probably be evaluated when the message buffer is created, so it wouldn't notice if the To field is manually changed
[22:49:41] <acdw> ^^ that appears to be the case
[22:49:41] <kensanata> pkal: Hm, true.
[22:49:57] <acdw> i'll ahve to dive deeper into message-templ or gnus-alias i spose
[22:50:13] <pkal> acdw: Don't know much about notmuch, but if you use message-mode, you can write a custom message-send-hook function that modifies the signature.
[22:50:24] <acdw> ahh, that is smart pkal, thanks
[22:50:38] <acdw> it's message-mode yeah
[22:51:31] <kensanata> I'd want to see it, though… Perhaps you can set up message-signature, and call message-insert-signature (perhaps with force), and if you like it, then perhaps there's a hook to put it on whenever you edit the To: header.
[22:51:39] <acdw> the thing is, even when i hit 'reply' it's not looking right
