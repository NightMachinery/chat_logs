[19:36:06] <lucerne> Recently, circe just silently fails to send messages sometimes.Looking at the messages, the only relevant thing is `Error running timer ‘irc-send--queue’: (error "Process irc.zii.lilf.ir<2> not running")`. I use `circe-reconnect`, but this message will just appear again. (BTW, the fact that the failure is silent is extremely annoying. How can I
[19:36:06] <lucerne> rely on circe if it silently fail to send messages, while the UI shows everything as okay?) circe continues to receive new messages just fine though.

[19:45:50] <Thaodan_> lucerne: I'm not sure what it is but to me it happens similar that when I was disconnect the message looks like it sends the message but immediate reconnects.
[19:51:41] <lucerne> I enabled the logs, and grepping for a message I sent, `C: PRIVMSG #fanfiction u9898298398` appears in the logs, but that message is not sent.
[19:55:44] <lucerne> Actually, the messages were sent after they appeared in the logs. I guess the problem solved itself for now, but this also happened earlier today. Isn't there someway to change the foreground of messages that are tet to be sent?
