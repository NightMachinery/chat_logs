[06:01:31] <artao> the "solution?" ......... bury it deeper <facepalm>
[06:01:33] <artao> <sigh>
[06:01:40] <louipc> what about the power of music?
[06:01:47] <artao> thorium fission is what we need. stop building plutonium reactors
[06:02:18] <louipc> i don't think you understand sir but sure those would be great
[06:02:33] <louipc> but why no music reactors?
[06:03:30] <artao> liquid cooled reactors literally cannot melt down
[06:03:33] <artao> or explode
[06:03:51] <artao> if there's an issue the metal solidifies and buries the reactor
[06:04:07] <artao> of course, it also completely ruins the reactor. ... but so does melting down or blowing up
[06:04:08] <artao> lol
[06:04:19] <artao> you know why we use plutonium reactors instead?
[06:04:33] <artao> thorium reactors can't make weapons grade material
[06:04:35] <artao> seriously
[06:04:43] <artao> that's the primary reason
[06:04:59] <artao> sure, they'er also harder to make
[06:05:08] <artao> but that's irrelephant these days
[06:06:16] <artao> way way way back in the 50s? okay. they didn't quite have the tech; but they had the tech to develop the tech
[06:06:27] <louipc> can music reactors explode with an abundance of artistic expression
[06:06:27] <artao> nowadays? those issues aren't a problem anymore
[06:06:36] <artao> oh yeah. SUPER dangerous
[06:06:47] <artao> they expose everyone for 1000s of miles to music
[06:06:49] <louipc> you will not be able to escape the tsunami of emotion washing over you
[06:07:20] <artao> it might snow this weekend
[06:07:25] <artao> fucking Wisconsin LOL
[06:07:34] <louipc> what if you eat a reaper
[06:07:43] <artao> i would surely die
[06:08:05] <louipc> it'll probably just melt wherever you look
[06:08:12] <artao> i have a very high heat tolerance
[06:08:16] <louipc> well at least your face will
[06:08:19] <artao> raw thai peppers? yummy
[06:08:30] <artao> jalepenos? no problem
[06:08:34] <artao> barely even notice
[06:08:54] <artao> habenjeros? use em in cooking ... but not eating alone

[06:19:33] <Panther> Q: Why does my EMF detector give very high (lethal) level EMF radiation next to metal frame glasses? Am I getting lethal radiation every day?
[06:19:40] <Panther> A: Since you are alive to type the question you are obviously not receiving ‘lethal radiation’ at all, let alone every day.

[18:00:10] <Rashad> kurd is phrygian, I think
[18:00:32] <Rashad> nahawand (if that comes up in the video) is the harmonic minor
[18:00:34] <macrobat> violin is pretty universal, the tuning isn't fixed
[18:01:20] <Rashad> yeah there is no frets 
[18:01:58] <Rashad> hijaz is harmonic minor but the root is the E
[18:02:02] <Rashad> instead of the A
[18:02:24] <Rashad> the name means that it comes from western Arabia, mecca and medina 
[18:02:45] <Rashad> so probably when the quran was first recited it was in this scale 
[18:03:00] <Rashad> you see Ajam at the end is the western major scale 
[18:03:10] <Rashad> "Ajam" means western/roman/etc

[18:06:01] <Rashad> the first is hijaz
[18:06:08] <macrobat> in equal temperament, you can transpose to any pitch and the relative intervals stay the same. practical when a song is out of your pitch range. this would be much harder in other systems. 
[18:06:26] <Rashad> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz

[18:06:39] <Rashad> well 
[18:06:55] <Rashad> piano is a big no no if you want to play any scale with half flats/sharps
[18:07:24] <Rashad> some people managed to create pianos that can change tuning by sliding something over the strings ("fluid piano") but it's just a novely

[18:19:59] <macrobat> aha, ibrahim maalouf
[18:20:18] <Rashad> yes yes!
[18:20:52] <Rashad> I would be content if on a digital instrument the flat third and 7th were made half flats instead of flats, so I can modulate between Rast and Major
[18:21:14] <macrobat> you can use equal temperament for the skeleton of the song and have notes from other systems as decoration
[18:24:58] <Rashad> this reciter is teaching how to modulate and gives an example where he modulates at 3:50 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7speWZDDj8

[18:58:31] <Rashad> if you don't get that right, it doesn't sound like itself 
[18:58:40] <macrobat> 31 edo is probably beyond maqam. every note sounds off, the familiar melody is almost not recognizable
[18:59:20] <Rashad> for example if you're playing C major and you stop at D, it always wants to go to C or E, but stopping at D is just Dorian.
[18:59:38] <Rashad> but it doesn't sound Dorian until you change the "rhythm" and then it doesn't want to go to C or E.
[18:59:52] <Rashad> maybe it shouldn't be called "rhythm" but that's the best way I can explain it
[19:00:03] <Rashad> macrobat yeah it doesn't sound good at all
[19:02:20] <macrobat> I think the harmonies would have to be reworked if you keep the melody close to the orig
[19:04:48] <macrobat> and the melody would probably not fit with the idea of rast anyway, as it is more than a scale

[22:40:36] <artao> i doubt that would taste good
[22:40:43] <artao> grind it down and put it in pill capsules
[22:40:44] <macrobat> I would guess it takes to long to absorb it through chewing

[22:42:22] <macrobat> there is yerba mixed with guarana, for more caffeine. would probably be the preferred method. I haven't tried
[22:42:26] <louipc> i guess helps break it down for absorbtion
[22:42:28] <macrobat> yerba mate
[22:42:28] <artao> they also sprinkle it over dead bodies
[22:42:43] <artao> yerba, guarana, ginsing
[22:42:44] <artao> mmm
[22:45:06] <macrobat> there is borrelia around here. a roomie had a mild case. just the bullseye rash

[23:22:57] <macrobat> I have a behringer compressor from the bargain bin that does absolutely nothing. I could use it if I ever solder my own effects

[23:23:10] <artao> lol
[23:23:30] <artao> i've heard their older stuff kinda sucks, which is why they have a bad rep and some people ridicule their synths

[23:23:51] <artao> i'm quite looking forward to the Pro VS
[23:23:59] <macrobat> a multi effect is so much better. costs like just a couple of pedals and you can save and recall presets

[23:28:28] <artao> it changes pitch, not volume
[23:28:40] <efex_> artao: history.. it became standardized hundreds of years ago, so the historic scores all use italian names for stuff.. that’s all
[23:28:48] <artao> or do i have them backwards
[23:28:53] <macrobat> you can vibrate with it, but slower bends isn't vibrato
[23:29:35] <artao> yeah
[23:29:36] <artao> "Tremolo is a modulation effect that creates a change in volume, while the "tremolo arm" on your guitar is actually vibrato, which is varying pitch."
