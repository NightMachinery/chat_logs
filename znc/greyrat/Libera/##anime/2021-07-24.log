[02:31:49] <mikau> I heard it handled better 2TB+ partitions.
[02:32:05] <Bco1981> i would say no... it gets in the way of me booting various flash drives.
[02:32:41] <MootPoot> honest question with all your linux peeps
[02:32:50] <MootPoot> did you just like
[02:32:53] <MootPoot> grow up with linux
[02:32:57] <MootPoot> was that your first computer
[02:33:07] <ButterNoodle> naa
[02:33:10] <mikau> Nope. Mine was Win97.
[02:33:15] <Bco1981> i abused a secondary pc to play with it first.
[02:33:43] <ButterNoodle> first actual pc with an OS... dos/win3.1

[02:34:53] <ButterNoodle> nt4.0.. almost had a service life as long as XP
[02:35:00] <Bco1981> yeah
[02:35:01] <MootPoot> yeah I think my first OS was win 98...but I only REALLY started using computers when XP hit
[02:35:18] <mikau> I remember having to buy a new machine because my home potato wouldn't handle the new Microsoft OS.
[02:35:28] <ButterNoodle> common problem mikau 
[02:35:54] <Bco1981> now you will experience that joy again, when windows 11 cums.
[02:36:11] <mikau> This one PC I'm using here ran so slowly with its native Win10. It was hell.
[02:36:23] <Bco1981> HDD ?
[02:36:27] <mikau> Yeah
[02:36:31] <Bco1981> windows 10 don't like that
[02:36:36] <Bco1981> get ssd fast

[02:53:50] <MootPoot> but anyway, legit, it costs you nothing, try out a dedicated DAC and get the most out of those HD 4.5s

[02:54:18] <MootPoot> yeah you can buy replacements
[02:54:23] <jessedesu_onaph> One side lost sound anyway
[02:54:42] <jessedesu_onaph> The 4.5 is bulletproof
[02:54:56] <jessedesu_onaph> The ear pad material is better
[02:55:20] <jessedesu_onaph> Hasn't ripped or deteriorated so far
[02:56:35] <jessedesu_onaph> I stepped on cable, had to replace that

[02:57:44] <MootPoot> lol
[02:58:27] <jessedesu_onaph> What if it disconnects
[02:58:32] <Bco1981> i even added a 9band equalizer to my setup
[02:58:34] <jessedesu_onaph> And goes to main speakers
[02:58:47] <MootPoot> idk about you but any BT I've ever used when it disconnects it auto pauses
[02:58:59] <MootPoot> you have to press play again for it to go to main speakers
[02:59:04] <MootPoot> or to connect to something else
[03:01:45] <jessedesu_onaph> My computer isn't smart enough to do that

[03:06:09] <jessedesu_onaph> Is dac input USB?
[03:06:20] <MootPoot> yeah
[03:06:23] <jessedesu_onaph> Is 2.0 ok
[03:06:27] <MootPoot> good enough
[03:06:33] <jessedesu_onaph> Or 3.0
[03:06:42] <MootPoot> it completely removes your computer's own audio circuits from use
[03:06:46] <MootPoot> 2.0 is plenty
[03:06:53] <MootPoot> audio isen't that high bandwidth
[03:07:17] <jessedesu_onaph> I'm looking at amazon
[03:07:46] <MootPoot> the highest bitrate audio you will realistically ever play is like 1200-1300kbit/s
[03:07:58] <MootPoot> usb 2.0 caps at likt 400-450Mbps
[03:08:11] <jessedesu_onaph> Ok
[03:08:18] <MootPoot> so like you'll be using 1.2/400 mbit of the total capacity of 2.0
[03:08:45] <jessedesu_onaph> Is the difference like night and day
[03:09:11] <MootPoot> the only reason why some dacs might be 3.0 is if its  more then just a dac ( mic or mixer board/ input board ) or you need to supply a bunch of power to the dac through usb
[03:09:13] <jessedesu_onaph> Will my ears cum
[03:09:16] <MootPoot> jessedesu_onaph:  night and day...hmm
[03:09:22] <MootPoot> to my ears I wont go back

[03:10:37] <jessedesu_onaph> With a shit ton of ports
[03:10:55] <MootPoot> all the onbuilt audio for computers is meh compared to a decent dedicated dac tbh
[03:11:23] <MootPoot> certain dedicated dacs can also work as an amplifier as well

[04:31:36] * MootPoot shrugs
[04:31:56] <MootPoot> idk about linux but changing audio output modes on win is just a menu and a dropdown away
[04:32:32] <emmeka> you'd think. I've got to do this through the command line, and it should be trivial, but the command just isn't working.

[04:40:18] <MootPoot> But that being said Linux is really lacking in the usability front 
[04:40:29] <emmeka> MootPoot I mean, with linux this comes with the territory, but that entirely depends on the distro.
[04:40:36] <emmeka> you will not get far with GUI in Arch.
[04:41:01] <MootPoot> Even the most Gui friendly Linux distros like Ubuntu are kinda lacking 
[04:41:03] <MootPoot> Tbh
[04:41:18] <MootPoot> Workable...but not nice 
[04:41:22] <emmeka> the GUI is there so randos can use it, not as your primary way to do things.
[04:41:31] <emmeka> you should know your way around the command line, it's not hard
[04:41:45] <emmeka> and few things in the world of computers beat the versatility of grep
[04:41:58] <MootPoot> With a distro like Ubuntu the primary method is supposed to be so randoms can use it though 
[04:42:05] <MootPoot> Its literally the main goal of the distro 
[04:42:19] <emmeka> well Ubuntu you don't need to, there's GUIs for everything a pleb would need
[04:42:27] <mixfix41> no it use to be a desktop target its a server target distro
[04:42:47] <mixfix41> at least i heard so by klaatu on gnuworldorder

[04:55:26] <MootPoot> .... How are you going to listen to audio without something to produce the sound 
[04:55:28] <mixfix41> because yes you can have a 'lame' inbetween setup
[04:55:47] <mixfix41> but its only because you save 300 hundred dollars but plateau your potential sound quality
[04:56:08] <mixfix41> while you spend 500 total on IEM then you have higher sound quality potential but i really dont want to go this far
[04:56:13] <MootPoot> Are you gonna look at the waveform on your computer and twang along on a metal cookie box lid
[04:56:15] <MootPoot> Lol
[04:56:17] <mixfix41> cause i will never measure the sound quality with equipment
[04:56:29] <mixfix41> im only an end user
[04:56:38] <mixfix41> mootpoot i just dont care at that point
[04:57:03] <MootPoot> I honestly have no idea what you're arguing 
[04:57:05] <mixfix41> the sound quality is in the headphones you have to consider my perspective and yes a dac will help i admit but for some reason i knee jerk argument about IEM
[04:57:26] <mixfix41> i dont know i just own IEM thats all ig
[04:57:33] <mixfix41> its probs a bad argument..
[04:57:39] <mixfix41> but it has a point
[04:58:01] <MootPoot> Yes...you still need IEMs / headphones/ speakers no matter what 
[04:58:06] <MootPoot> And good ones 
[04:58:07] <mixfix41> buy IEMs and you are set (which _could_ have a pitfall, its too exp, too much money on your ears while in public)
[04:58:10] <MootPoot> What's your pint 
[04:58:55] <mixfix41> my point is just consider it along with deciding to upgrade cans and a dac while considering the costs and have it a comparison rather than not consider IEM
[04:58:58] <mixfix41> that sall
[04:59:26] <MootPoot> IEMs are just another form of output device 
[04:59:28] <mixfix41> it get a saying cause its the more expensive option
[04:59:42] <mixfix41> like if OLED prices were to because budget prices from a reputable company
[04:59:46] <MootPoot> If you already have a good output device you're happy with 
[04:59:50] <MootPoot> Why change 
[04:59:56] <mixfix41> then say buy this budget luxury tv than the best IPA monitor
[05:00:03] <MootPoot> It doesn't matter what form factory they are 
[05:00:15] <mixfix41> tru
[05:00:32] <mixfix41> its a fullly loaded burger so this discussion drags..
[05:00:46] <mixfix41> you dont own IEM tho
[05:00:49] <mixfix41> so theres that
[05:00:54] <mixfix41>  and i dont have a usb dac eithe
[05:00:57] <MootPoot> The entire point of a dac is to get the best out of a set of good output devices 
[05:01:02] <MootPoot> That you already have 
[05:01:05] <MootPoot> mixfix41: says who?
[05:01:11] <mixfix41> i assume
[05:01:31] <MootPoot> I have IEMs, headphones, usb DACs and decent integrated dacs
[05:01:40] <mixfix41> what is the best tho
[05:02:00] <mixfix41> is it hearing everything or assuming u hear everything based on your judgement and efforts to reserach that data
[05:02:02] <MootPoot> Best for what scenario 
[05:02:22] <MootPoot> At home? = Headphones and dac
[05:02:31] <mixfix41> well i guess you do know
[05:02:33] <MootPoot> Outside? IEMs and dac
[05:02:33] <mixfix41> if you own IEM
[05:02:44] <mixfix41> basically just any sound file
[05:02:47] <mixfix41> so that is anywhere
[05:03:22] <MootPoot> IEMs aren't some magic thing that automatically guarantees the best lol
[05:03:29] <MootPoot> Its just another output device
[05:03:29] <mixfix41> really?
[05:03:31] <mixfix41> thats odd
[05:03:37] <mixfix41> cause it does
[05:03:40] <mixfix41> mine do
[05:03:51] <mixfix41> it seems like..
[05:03:59] <mixfix41> you hear everything (in the sound file)
[05:04:08] <MootPoot> Its literally just another speaker 
[05:04:12] <MootPoot> Headphones are speakers 
[05:04:12] <mixfix41> ...mm
[05:04:17] <MootPoot> Speakers are speakers 
[05:04:21] <MootPoot> IEMs are speakers 
[05:04:33] *** Quits: snake (~snake@user/snake) (Quit: Namae nado nai, omae to onaji da..)
[05:04:33] <MootPoot> IEMs are usually the worst out of all of them 
[05:04:39] <MootPoot> Due to the small driver size 
[05:04:43] <mixfix41> they have no bass
[05:04:50] <mixfix41> but you hear everything in teh sound file
[05:04:57] <MootPoot> You can get good ones, but a small driver is a small driver 
[05:05:04] <mixfix41> i have dual drivers in my IEM
[05:05:27] <MootPoot> mixfix41: if you can't hear the bass that the file was recorded with then by definition you can't hear "everything in the file"
[05:05:29] <MootPoot> Lol
[05:05:30] <mixfix41> which IEM do you have cause thats concerning viewpoint imo
[05:05:45] <mixfix41> yea but its a different medium
[05:05:58] <mixfix41> i think yuou are getting vision shrouded by the technical terms
[05:06:18] <mixfix41> cause my practical understanding of it is more relating to how i can explain it
[05:06:46] <mixfix41> which monitors do you have and how many drivers are inside?
[05:07:02] <mixfix41> my are only dual drivers
[05:07:08] <MootPoot> Arguing how many drivers the IEMs have is a technicality lol
[05:07:19] <mixfix41> okay but why are you beating around the bush
[05:07:22] <MootPoot> If I get this right 
[05:07:24] <mixfix41> just to get to the bottom of it
[05:07:26] <MootPoot> Your argument is 
[05:07:38] <mixfix41> dont tell me im for healthy discussion but not stoopid discussion MootPoot 
[05:07:53] <MootPoot> "IEMs are the best and deliver the best because I feel that they deliver the best for me"
[05:08:00] <mixfix41> well
[05:08:27] <mixfix41> fine but be that way i only want to helps someones 'consideration' not force them that they are dumb for not deciding this way only just to consider it
[05:08:29] <MootPoot> I have Shure SE-425s
[05:08:30] <mixfix41> so
[05:08:34] <mixfix41> its not a big deal
[05:08:37] <mixfix41> ok..
[05:08:39] <mixfix41> lemme see..
[05:09:18] <mixfix41> these are ear buds
[05:09:26] <mixfix41> you didnt even get an ear doctor mould
[05:09:44] <mixfix41> albiet more expensive ear buds
[05:09:51] <mixfix41> but
[05:09:52] <mixfix41> i mean
[05:10:07] <mixfix41> i sample 1964 audio basically this way and thought the same about the audio quality
[05:10:17] <mixfix41> so i mean i dont know its just my dumb opinion on quality
[05:10:30] <MootPoot> Custom ear moulds are just another way to get the most out of your output device 
[05:10:31] <MootPoot> Lol
[05:10:37] <MootPoot> Just like a dac
[05:10:52] <mixfix41> true i mightve put too much weight on ripping on dacs
[05:11:01] <mixfix41> well i did
[05:11:15] <MootPoot> And you already use DACs
[05:11:32] <MootPoot> But refuse to acknowledge it ( or did yesterday ) 
[05:11:43] <mixfix41> i never bought additional accessories
[05:11:49] <mixfix41> i dont get why you bring it up
[05:11:53] <mixfix41> or feel the need to
[05:12:02] <mixfix41> it increases dialogue and my responese..
[05:12:10] <MootPoot> Because you keep on ignoring how important DACs are 
[05:12:20] <MootPoot> You have IEMs right? What do you plug them into 
[05:12:20] <mixfix41> if i frame this dialogue i can highlight the important parts..
[05:12:24] <MootPoot> To get music 
[05:12:51] <mixfix41> my asus mobo or my portable sd card music player
[05:13:06] <MootPoot> Congratulations, both of those devices have onboard DACs 
[05:13:34] <mixfix41> why the sarcasm?
[05:13:41] <MootPoot> Anytime you convert an digital audio file to sound output you use a dac 
[05:13:58] <mixfix41> sometimes those dacs go through my lan big whoop
[05:14:14] <MootPoot> mixfix41: Because you're pretending like DACs are some stupid technicality when they are integral to the process of listening to music 
[05:14:25] <mixfix41> no
[05:14:26] <MootPoot> Also they don't go through the lan lol
[05:14:36] <MootPoot> Its a piece of hardware 
[05:14:41] <mixfix41> i meant dont upgrade your dac before you have custommould iem or consider that fact
[05:15:02] <mixfix41> you gotta see it clearer cause sarcasm like that just makes me kinda not like talking to you about it
[05:15:44] <MootPoot> mixfix41: yes, I agree with you here although slightly edited 
[05:16:04] <MootPoot> Its not worth getting a dedicated dac if you already don't have a good output device 
[05:16:23] <mixfix41> at the end of the day. IEM are a luxury. they are rich in sound and they might not get too much usage cause you throw something else on on loudspeaker, cheap headphones, tv sound etc
[05:16:38] <mixfix41> so maybe not a good choice to even have and waste money on 
[05:16:46] <mixfix41> its not a big issue if you dont have it just
[05:17:00] <MootPoot> I use full size headphones 99% of the time 
[05:17:05] <mixfix41> if you are 2-3 hundred dollars shy to this solution and you are buying then its still a good consideration
[05:17:31] <MootPoot> There's no point of investing in custom ear moulds when a good over ear cup does as good or a better job 
[05:17:41] <MootPoot> And I don't need the portability of IEMs
[05:18:01] <mixfix41> true its my opinion
[05:18:19] <mixfix41> you were firstly of all telling jesse about suggest setups
[05:18:22] <mixfix41> so i chime in about it
[05:18:26] <mixfix41> its that simple
[05:18:45] <MootPoot> The reason why is because Jesse was only concerned with sitting at home and listening at a desk 
[05:18:47] <mixfix41> i do think i wouldnt buy those monitors
[05:19:04] <mixfix41> if i go IEM route go with 1964 as the cheapest IEM option and get moulding 100%
[05:19:05] <MootPoot> Why would you get a portable set of IEMs when you don't need to be portable 
[05:19:17] <mixfix41> true its my opinion <=
[05:19:30] <mixfix41> and suggestions
[05:19:46] <MootPoot> He already has a good set of headphones 
[05:19:53] <MootPoot> Sennheiser HD 4.5s
[05:20:09] <mixfix41> yea and 100 dollar dac is a lot cheaper than IEM i understand
[05:20:24] <MootPoot> No, IEMs are cheap as well lol
[05:20:34] <MootPoot> Its just another output device 
[05:20:45] <MootPoot> You can get 30 dollar IEMs and 1500 dollar IEMs 
[05:20:51] <mixfix41> well dual drivers and custom ear mould expect to spend around five hundred
[05:20:55] <MootPoot> Just being an iem is not special 
[05:22:08] <MootPoot> Yes but again, the only thing that IEMs have going for them is small size and portability
[05:22:12] <MootPoot> That's it

[05:25:23] <mixfix41> these custom IEM wont drown out venting when you are in a bad mood but they kick a hella lot of sound
[05:25:36] <amigojapan> Good morning
[05:26:11] <mixfix41> something cans are probably better equip for anyway cause you can throw them on your head quickly 
[05:27:08] <MootPoot> These days I mainly just use 4 setups 
[05:28:06] <mixfix41> well also think about this company as well 1964 i only bought one pair so my vision is also skewed i have no other experience and wont with other companies but i still dont calculate how you talk about IEM are not special that makes me gawk inside
[05:28:20] <MootPoot> Airpods pro with Bluetooth, HD 599SE with dac, sony XM3 with Bluetooth or with my phone quad dac if it's low on battery 
[05:29:12] <MootPoot> I don't use the shures much 
[05:29:22] <mixfix41> see im hestitant to find the middle ground its not very practical for me. i go cheapest buds and let my player battery drain quickly and charge it again im happy
[05:29:29] <MootPoot> Speakers I use the Bose soundbar mini with a dedicated dac 
[05:30:00] <mixfix41> so your right my suggestion is a lot of money
[05:30:02] <mixfix41> its too much

[05:32:42] <MootPoot> I don't really buy from new unknown companies 
[05:33:44] <mixfix41> okay but my strategy isnt terrible. im saying use all the default speakers of the devices and just get that grand one too so it shouldnt have to be IEM its just the route i took
[05:34:47] <mixfix41> man ina minecraft stream was pretty entertaining this morning i dont know why

[05:37:03] <mixfix41> i own two beats one can (which i use to use) but i dont cause its uses two triple aaas and recently one side i need to repair now . and i dont really like them but i use to use them. and i have beats bt earbuds as a gift . they take up dust even if they were functional.

[05:44:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At the same time, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions" can be said in context of well-intended extremists.

[05:52:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The interesting aspect of consequentialism is that while "the end justifies the means" is perfeclty valid in it, it applies both way. Good intentions that led to disaster? Disaster is the outcome.
[05:53:17] <amigojapan> I see
[05:53:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm sure you can imagine how that'd be likewise problematic.
[05:53:38] <amigojapan> Right

[05:56:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Is the SMB host also a macOS?
[05:57:13] <MootPoot> No, it's windows 10
[05:57:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Then that'd be why.
[05:57:29] <MootPoot> Huh
[05:57:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> SMB is its own filesystem protocol which abstracts away the end storage backend.
[05:57:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Much like NFS for that matter.
[05:57:41] <MootPoot> Ah
[05:58:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically you're seeing the distinction between Networked Filesystem (Protocol) and Filesystem.

[06:57:25] <emmeka> what I was doing wasn't technically wrong I just... was uh... forgetting what program I was trying to mess with
[06:57:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: Yes, but it all defers everything to the sink object.
[06:57:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: Implementation is up to the sink, essentially.
[06:57:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I wouldn't be at all surprised if they're dynamically loaded too, so that arbitrary sink modules can exist.
[06:58:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's technically C but it's pretty much using objects.
[06:59:33] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: so you think both a person who wants to commit "ethnic cleansing"and someone that just wants to commit genocide cause they hate the group they are killing are equally as responsible? If they both act Upton it?
[06:59:35] <mixfix41> when i migrate to pipewire is probs when i will start using wayland
[06:59:41] <mixfix41> not yet tho
[07:00:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: In both cases it's crimes against humanity and the fact they considered themselves to be acting in good doesn't make it less so.
[07:00:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Arguably it's more disturbing.
[07:00:32] <amigojapan> I see Aurora_v_kosmose 
[07:00:36] <emmeka> uhhhhhh I'm really confused though, I am actually running pavucontrol as the audio mixer, which I think is for pulseaudio? That's probably why I thought it was pulseaudio... but does pavucontrol even work with pipewire?
[07:01:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: Pipewire provides a large part of the pulseaudio interface.
[07:01:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> s/interface/API/
[07:01:22] <marblesurf> is it better than pulse?
[07:01:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> marblesurf: It's intended to be and to unify JACK and pulseaudio in a single sound server system
[07:02:09] <mixfix41> marblesurf: no not if you have specific device that works
[07:02:18] <mixfix41> but it could measure up possibly
[07:02:24] <mixfix41> youd have to learn  it though
[07:02:25] <marblesurf> my mic has static and idk how to fix it
[07:02:33] <emmeka> and the taskbar plugin for pavucontrol for me is still called pulseaudio plugin even though I can see that pipewire is running and not pulseaudio... idk... anyway... time to figure it out all over again
[07:02:34] <marblesurf> arch wiki didn't help
[07:02:45] <ButterNoodle> JACK was named after its original coder Jack Mehoff
[07:03:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: Pavucontrol doesn't know it's not pulseaudio
[07:03:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: That's the point. So that it doesn't break existing tools and quietly takes over

[07:03:45] * ButterNoodle puts on his #archlinux hat
[07:03:57] <isekaijin> So it is an “if it acts like PulseAudio, it might as well be PulseAudio”-like thing?

[07:04:03] <ButterNoodle> Sounds like an upstream problem, go to #whatevertheproblemis

[07:08:58] <Sadale> isekaijin, just curious. Are web browsers in emacs run in text-only mode?
[07:09:47] <isekaijin> Emacs has (shitty) graphical web browsers too.
[07:09:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sadale: There's some unmaintained webkit widget. Use at your own risk

[07:10:24] <Omega037> do any of you guys have smart doorbell with cameras?
[07:10:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> nope
[07:10:34] <Sadale> I see. So modern web browsers won't work there :(
[07:10:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Omega037: If I ever get it, I'll make it myself. So it only talks to my infra and no one else's.
[07:10:55] <isekaijin> Omega037: Like, why would you even want that kind of thing? So that now the very entrance of your home can be remotely pwned?
[07:11:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Doorbell can mostly be annoying. Camera is spying risk.
[07:11:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A doorlock would be a much more problematic item if it could be remotely pwn'd.
[07:12:16] <Omega037> well, we had some packages stolen the other day
[07:12:25] <Omega037> that is basically why
[07:13:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Omega037: While cameras can serve as deterance, I find it most effective to simply have them delivered to a postal box inside of a mailing place I can simply go to and pick it up.
[07:13:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Of course since the pandemic I haven't done that since I'm always home anyway
[07:13:26] <Omega037> ok
[07:13:37] <Omega037> well, I am looking for a bell cam
[07:13:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But when I worked away from home I did that.
[07:13:50] <Omega037> was thinking about an Arlo, since they are direct wifi
[07:13:57] <MootPoot> Omega037:  afaik most of the porch pirates also just cover their face
[07:13:58] <MootPoot> tbh
[07:14:15] <Omega037> well, at least you know it is stolen
[07:14:24] <Omega037> Post to nextdoor
[07:14:24] <MootPoot> if you can, instead of that a 1 way lockable box
[07:14:30] <Omega037> it is usually neighborhood kids
[07:14:31] <isekaijin> You will eventually know it is stolen anyway.
[07:14:32] <MootPoot> or just get it posted online
[07:14:40] <MootPoot> posted to the local office*
[07:14:44] <MootPoot> for you to pickup
[07:14:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Omega037: Doesn't help you if you were waiting for something within a tight timespan
[07:14:49] <Omega037> Well, sometimes things are delivered to the wrong place
[07:14:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> local postal office pickup is best option
[07:15:09] <MootPoot> local office, or one way lockable box really
[07:15:10] <Omega037> A special dropoff box is not a bad idea
[07:15:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Depending on country & other stuff, it may or may not be free.
[07:15:18] <Omega037> Though a lot of our packages are larger
[07:15:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Upper limits for mine were pretty big.
[07:15:35] <emmeka> "By default PipeWire sets a global sample rate of 48kHz. If you need to change it (e.g. you own a DAC supporting a higher value) you can do it by editing the line default.clock.rate = 48000 in the configuration file /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf."
[07:15:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Though I did have some stuff just delivered at my workplace too. Like a computer case.
[07:15:43] <emmeka> ok, but, /etc/pipewire does not exist...
[07:15:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which I carried home through the metro.
[07:15:48] <emmeka> ughhhhh
[07:15:55] <MootPoot> emmeka:  what does your wife think about your mad IT skills
[07:15:59] <isekaijin> emmeka: sudo mkdir -p /etc/pipewire
[07:16:06] <Omega037> Anyways, was just looking for opinions on models
[07:16:09] <isekaijin> Errr, the -p is not necessary, silly me.
[07:16:17] <emmeka> isekaijin yes I am aware, this does not materialize pipewire.conf into existence.
[07:16:19] <MootPoot> Omega037:  for me I just use a tp link with an sd card
[07:16:29] <MootPoot> its not a doorbell cam
[07:16:50] <isekaijin> emmeka: Then you create it. There is probably a default configuration somewhere that you can just copy.
[07:16:54] <MootPoot> but just a camera that is restricted to local wlan and has its own sd card installed in a stealthy spot
[07:16:55] <MootPoot> thats it
[07:17:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: Look for stuff under /usr/share/doc/pipewire, /usr/share/lib/...
[07:18:50] <mixfix41> usr/share/pipewire/pipewire.conf
[07:18:50] <mixfix41>  
[07:19:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah right, some programs and libraries eschew the normal hierarchy when they believe they're large/important enough

[07:26:08] <emmeka> mixfix41 cool, it's there. but there's actually multiple .conf files... guess I'll just mess with em all
[07:26:19] <isekaijin> Aurora_v_kosmose: I just DuckDuckWent it. It seems pretty cool.
[07:27:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> :3
[07:27:14] <mixfix41> specifically to get the problem solve and its not just a source sink issue?
[07:27:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I expect emmeka's mess to be the breakdown of pipewire's emulation of pulseaudio
[07:27:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They probably need to use pipewire-specific stuff
[07:28:37] <Omega037> So I guess I am now de-turd from getting a door cam
[07:28:59] <Omega037> Or at least I recognize it wont probably solve the issue any more than just having a fake one
[07:29:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Omega037: More expensive and less safe than just having stuff delivered to a safer location

[07:34:28] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose yeah, I would, but they're in OFTC and I haven't bothered showing up over there.
[07:34:37] <emmeka> and ##anime has the best answers anyway
[07:34:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: #pipewire absolutely has a libera channel
[07:35:06] <emmeka> it's unofficial, but yeah, I found it... after I found the solution, ofc
[07:35:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> heh
[07:37:03] <emmeka> well, solution. I can't figure out how to change the actual sampling rate of the sink with pipewire... but I can change the default one it should make everything use... so we'll see if that works.
[07:38:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I can't really help you with that one, I've never used pipewire
[07:40:07] <MootPoot> by definition, a pipe is not a wire 
[07:40:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Except in servers for bandwidth
[07:40:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ::p
[07:40:25] <emmeka> well, that didn't work.
[07:40:30] <emmeka> go figures.
[07:40:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Technically wires are electron pipes.
[07:40:43] <MootPoot> not really no
[07:40:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Although electrons don't necessarily need a medium to move.
[07:40:55] <MootPoot> electronics jump from molecule to molecule
[07:41:03] <MootPoot> they dont go through an empty space in the middle
[07:41:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Electron gun vacuum tubes.
[07:41:19] <MootPoot> hmmm
[07:41:20] <isekaijin> Whoa, Nyxt seems pretty good so far.
[07:41:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: They're supposed to be gasless and there's an intervening empty space.
[07:42:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Particles usually stay around eachother, but that's not an absolute.
[07:42:23] <MootPoot> idk how they work

[09:46:08] <MootPoot> but anyway, the original point was that "there was no point programming on windows" , and the fact that .NET core dosen't yet ( but will soon ) support all the things is a reason why you'd code on windows ( and this is not even including years worth of legacy support for exising stuff )

[11:02:48] <JesseDesu> if theres a filipino checkmark box, i go for that
[11:03:05] <JesseDesu> usually clumped together with pacific islander
[11:03:27] <JesseDesu> i raced a vfr800 briefly on my way home
[11:03:33] <JesseDesu> then he made a left turn
[11:03:34] <ButterNoodle> nice
[11:03:41] <ButterNoodle> I like the vfr800
[11:03:56] <JesseDesu> i got ahead because skinnier profile
[11:04:10] <JesseDesu> i'm thinking of doing bar end mirrors
[11:04:18] <ButterNoodle> I hate those
[11:04:22] <JesseDesu> i'd have to get proper block off plates 
[11:04:39] <JesseDesu> ButterNoodle, i wish my mirrors would shapeshift
[11:04:55] <ButterNoodle> if ur on a naked, moto, or retro.. they are fine
[11:04:57] <JesseDesu> actually, i wish my whole motorcycle just turns into a jet fighter
[11:05:04] <ButterNoodle> actually I dont like them on naked
[11:05:18] <ButterNoodle> I want another 100hp
[11:05:32] <ButterNoodle> but they dont make that
[11:05:33] <JesseDesu> why do car mirrors have to be exactly the same height as motorcycle mirrors
[11:05:40] <JesseDesu> that pisses me off
[11:05:56] <JesseDesu> and sometimes i get a cbr600rr behind me while lane splitting
[11:06:00] <JesseDesu> and i hold them up
[11:06:04] <JesseDesu> cuz of the mirror clearance
[11:07:05] <JesseDesu> i have a jardine exhaust
[11:07:14] <JesseDesu> never heard of it before i bought it
[11:07:20] <JesseDesu> but it sounds awesome
[11:07:38] <ButterNoodle> they alright.. I like how they sound on the rc51
[11:08:01] <JesseDesu> i had an M4 on my nt650 honda hawk
[11:08:28] <JesseDesu> motorcycle cop stopped me once, saying my pipe is for track not street
[11:08:31] <JesseDesu> but he let me go
[11:08:35] <ButterNoodle> lol
[11:08:38] <ButterNoodle> CA be like that
[11:09:01] <JesseDesu> motorcycle cops like to stop other motorcycles
[11:09:09] <JesseDesu> cuz they know them better
[11:09:28] <JesseDesu> i was stopped by a cop car once for running a red light
[11:09:33] <JesseDesu> he let me go too
[11:09:35] <JesseDesu> lol
[11:11:30] <JesseDesu> but yea, historically i've been stopped for not yielding at a pedestrian crosswalk twice, one for license plate incorrectly mounted, one for illegal left turn, and one for a bad brake light
[11:11:33] <JesseDesu> and the pipe noise
[11:11:51] <ButterNoodle> speeding..
[11:11:55] <JesseDesu> never
[11:12:02] <ButterNoodle> thats all I've been stopped for
[11:12:42] <JesseDesu> what is your answer when they ask
[11:12:49] <JesseDesu> do you know how fast you were going?
[11:13:00] <ButterNoodle> I never answer that question...
[11:13:06] <JesseDesu> i thought so
[11:13:16] <ButterNoodle> "I was going a little fast"
[11:13:27] <JesseDesu> whats the best answer
[11:13:38] <JesseDesu> fenderbassist knows
[11:13:50] <JesseDesu> he's got links to those videos on how to talk to cops
[11:13:51] <ButterNoodle> you have to read the cop
[11:14:16] <JesseDesu> read their lips?
[11:14:22] <ButterNoodle> their attitude
[11:14:42] <ButterNoodle> if they are hot headed.. yes/no sir
[11:14:53] <ButterNoodle> extra proper and polite
[11:15:01] <ButterNoodle> cause ur getting a ticket
[11:15:32] <JesseDesu> that one time for the red light i was pretty sure i was gonna get a ticket
[11:15:33] <ButterNoodle> like the time I got pulled over on the concours
[11:15:36] <JesseDesu> but luck
[11:15:54] <ButterNoodle> I was going way over 100...

[11:25:31] <JesseDesu> yes
[11:25:45] <JesseDesu> its a mobile workstation
[11:25:47] <JesseDesu> technically
[11:26:00] <JesseDesu> i spent $500 on it in 2017
[11:26:07] <JesseDesu> back then it was only 5 years old
[11:26:11] <JesseDesu> so now its 9 years old
[11:26:30] <Bco1981> very often, laptop manufactures slack on the audio chip.
[11:27:01] <Bco1981> with a usb dac you bypass that, pretty sure it will give a nice effect.

[11:47:35] <il> good fer you :)
[11:48:00] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: nope.. not for me
[11:48:54] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: in Japan when they say they are chiropractors most usually they are just giving massage
[11:49:01] <il> Yeah, the hip cracking gives me the heebiejeebies
[11:49:17] <il> chripractice isn't medicine anyway
[11:49:23] <il> chiropractice
[11:49:31] <ButterNoodle> yea I curled up in a ball a lil when I hear that crunch il

[11:50:32] <amigojapan> il: it feels good, does not matter if it is not medicine
[11:50:36] <ButterNoodle> I'm falling apart anyway.. that shit would probably paralyze me

[11:50:54] <il> You sound old
[11:51:09] <ButterNoodle> I'd let a cute girl walk up my back.. I member that felt good
[11:51:16] <ButterNoodle> il: I am
[11:51:16] <isekaijin> You cannot possibly be doing that bad if you can chat on IRC right now.
[11:51:57] <ButterNoodle> naa, I've worked hard to get back in good health after a motorcycle accident and years of bad diet and heavy drinking
[11:52:04] <ButterNoodle> I'm doing ok
[11:52:28] <il> ButterNoodle, what motorcycle was it
[11:52:43] <ButterNoodle> concours 14
[11:53:08] <ButterNoodle> taxi made a u turn from the far right lane and ran into the side of me
[11:53:40] <il> Oh that's a touring bike
[11:53:55] <ButterNoodle> wasnt terrible.. but some soft tissue damage
[11:53:55] <il> Yeah, taxi drivers are a cancer of society
[11:54:06] <ButterNoodle> well if they didnt drive like animals
[11:54:15] <il> I hope he paid for all of it
[11:54:42] <ButterNoodle> nope.. he wasnt insured for enough
[11:55:01] <il> of course
[11:55:09] <ButterNoodle> can u imagine a taxi company only being required to be insured for 50K?
[11:55:25] <ButterNoodle> state minimum
[11:55:55] <il> Yeah, I don't know US laws, but I know I wouldn't live there unless I was paid a lot lol
[11:55:59] <ButterNoodle> the MRI's I had were 1/2 that
[11:56:12] <il> That's insane
[11:57:41] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: that is mostly your doctor ripping you off American style
[11:57:55] <ButterNoodle> well medicine is big business here...
[11:58:25] <ButterNoodle> and diagnostic imaging is where most of the money is made.. or a least a large amount
[11:58:41] <ButterNoodle> the doctor didnt make shit... that all goes to the hospital
[11:59:10] <amigojapan> isekaijin: if your standard to measure health is ability to come on irc, your standard is not very high
[12:00:24] <il> Yeah, irc is very accessible, imo
[12:00:32] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: what I say stands. Even if it is someone else ripping you off
[12:00:46] <il> Simplicity of the protocol makes it easy to write accessible clients
[12:00:56] <ButterNoodle> *healthcare is a ripoff in america
[12:01:31] <amigojapan> IRC is available by smartphone. You could be ircing from the er
[12:01:50] <amigojapan> Right ButterNoodle 
[12:02:01] <il> healthcare more like
[12:02:03] <il> healthnotcare
[12:02:51] <ButterNoodle> its only affordable to the poor (that just dont pay) and the rich that are capable of paying
[12:03:02] <ButterNoodle> middle class get fucked
[12:03:03] <isekaijin> Probably more like healthcare is paid for with taxes in most developed countries, but the US is not “most developed countries”.
[12:03:13] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I meant to ask you, do you have any advice on timing a beard. I have met it grow this time
[12:03:23] <ButterNoodle> Nice! 
[12:03:49] <ButterNoodle> for a shorter beard I just use hair clippers.. and find the attachment I like
[12:03:51] <amigojapan> :)
[12:04:02] <ButterNoodle> trim the neck beard off and I'm good
[12:04:04] <amigojapan> Ah
[12:04:16] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[12:04:18] <ButterNoodle> I dont like beards that stop at the chin tho
[12:04:32] <il> what
[12:04:43] <il> what do you mean beards that start at the chin
[12:04:55] <il> like when people trim their neck too high all the way up to their jaw line?
[12:05:01] <ButterNoodle> yep
[12:05:03] <ButterNoodle> line beard
[12:05:06] <il> Yeah, that's terrible
[12:05:08] <ButterNoodle> terrible

[12:05:25] <il> above*
[12:05:32] <ButterNoodle> fax rite there il
[12:05:44] <il> Yeah, I think most guys are learning it these days lol
[12:05:47] <il> most bearded guys
[12:05:52] <ButterNoodle> I havent shaved/trimmed since november
[12:06:00] <il> I've been shaving from the beginning of january until the beginning of july
[12:06:06] <ButterNoodle> I have the great sage level beard going on
[12:06:11] <il> and now I'm letting my 'beard' grow a little. It's pathetic
[12:06:20] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: funny thing, after my beard started growing I started programming something again lol. Samson theory holds
[12:06:21] <il> My cheeks are really very pathetic
[12:06:41] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: yes, beards are required for faster coding
[12:07:36] <il> The mustache retains the coffee which aids in programming
[12:07:39] <il> it's science
[12:07:55] <ButterNoodle> yes, the beard is the flavor saver
[12:09:57] <Bco1981> wow, there is almost no mods for 1.16.3...
[12:09:58] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: but I am also used to using sugar to boost my programming when I am tired
[12:10:10] <ButterNoodle> *coffee
[12:10:16] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: no sugar is hard
[12:10:23] <ButterNoodle> add heavy whipping cream
[12:10:31] <amigojapan> Alright
[12:10:45] <ButterNoodle> I'm going to make some coffee whip cream for snacking

[18:28:15] <amigojapan> Hey Aurora_v_kosmose 
[18:28:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: hey
[18:28:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> isekaijin: It used to be a better Java. But then Oracle realized that if they didn't fix their shitty language design choices they'd start losing major marketshare.
[18:29:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So Java started seeing a lot of usability improvements afterward.
[18:29:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Java <8 had some really questionable design choices.
[18:29:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Such as not reificating functions as lambda objects.
[18:31:22] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: Java have always disliked Java. Like how you still need to use i.equals(q)
[18:31:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> imo non-overloadable operators are a major design flaw in a language.
[18:32:15] <amigojapan> Yup
[18:32:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> On the other hand it's mostly because it's awkward in Java. (equals a b) and (= a b) have different meanings in Lisp.
[18:33:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> erh, (equal a b)
[18:33:16] <amigojapan> You could just have triple equal

[18:34:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> All with different levels of comparison.
[18:34:56] <amigojapan> Let me see
[18:36:11] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I guess it would help to be a bit more verbose in the naming
[18:36:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, trying to golf things often ends-up counterproductive
[18:36:49] <amigojapan> Agreed
[18:38:17] <Bco1981> oh... i have a defect...
[18:38:18] <Bco1981> Individuals and animals without a functional vestibular (balance) system are immune to motion sickness.
[18:38:34] <Bco1981> my balance works perfectly fine
[18:40:09] <amigojapan> Bco1981: for what it is worth.i tried the cardboard version and did not get motion sickness
[18:40:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Lisp kinda gets a pass because operators aren't in any way different from mundane functions
[18:40:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Except for a few basic ones from which everything else is implemented with.
[18:40:37] <Bco1981> nice, you are good to go. Because those things will get to fast.
[18:40:52] <Bco1981> *will get you fastØ
[18:40:53] <Bco1981> *
[18:40:56] <amigojapan> Right Aurora_v_kosmose 
[18:41:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You totally can redefine #'+ if you feel like it. It's a bad idea, but you can.
[18:42:11] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: did we start talking about lisp again?
[18:42:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yes.
[18:42:26] <amigojapan> Ok
[18:42:41] <amigojapan> I don't know how we got to lisp
[18:43:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: I was mostly comparing the "no overloading permitted" to "redefine whatever you want lol"
[18:43:27] <amigojapan> Ah ok gotcha
[18:44:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And the fact you can generally just use (eql a b) (eql a some-object) and usually always get sensible results.
[18:44:21] <amigojapan> Yeah. Overloading seems good to me
[18:45:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Most Lisp-derived libs tend to go for defining their operators as generic methods and implementing a few of them for what they provide in the lib
[18:45:49] <amigojapan> I see
[18:46:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Other languages  special-case it instead like this: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Eq.html

[18:46:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Erh, -_- 
[18:46:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Some languages offer a structured definition method. Others special-case it.
[18:46:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Rust goes the structured way.
[18:47:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's also partially special-case due to not directly interacting with the '= symbol.
[18:47:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> '==
[18:49:35] <amigojapan> I see
[18:53:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The reason I initially got a bit confused is there are some libs in CL that do this: https://github.com/alex-gutev/generic-cl/
[18:53:19] <ImoutoBot> [title] GitHub - alex-gutev/generic-cl: Generic function interface to standard Common Lisp functions
[18:53:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or basically converting the operators to all being generics you can define arbitrary specializations for.
[18:56:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Personally I'm fond of the generic and structural approaches.
[18:56:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They're more versatile and useful than special-casing things.

[18:59:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: You can use Scala :3 It's compatible with Java's libs.
[18:59:45] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: no special cars where you need to know how Java works?
[18:59:56] <amigojapan> Cases but cars
[19:00:08] <amigojapan> Cases not cars

[19:02:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: The easiest way would pretty much be to simply just use Scala libs

[22:25:19] * ButterNoodle hard passes
[22:25:27] <ButterNoodle> I run arch
[22:25:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> :p
[22:25:53] <ButterNoodle> mostly without a desktop, just like the gods intended
[22:26:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As far as source-based distributions go, I much prefer Guix and Nix.
[22:26:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Far saner design.
[22:26:44] <ButterNoodle> I tried nix.. and dont have time to learn a new way to maintain a box
[22:26:49] <ButterNoodle> its nice and all
[22:27:17] <ButterNoodle> I have about 50 arch installs to maintain
[22:27:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It gets rid of the dependency hell conflict nonsense, and replicable builds are much more the focus.
[22:27:24] <ButterNoodle> ansible be nice
[22:27:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Guix (and Nix) have something for management of remote nodes.
[22:27:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can also manage services and local stuff.
[22:28:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I don't really use it in that capacity. My servers are mainly Debian-based.
[22:28:21] <ButterNoodle> yea if I was wanting something bleeding edge that was release based for cloud it makes sense, as opposed to rolling release
[22:28:54] <ButterNoodle> *but if u -Suy everything at the same time its all on the same version :3
[22:28:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Eh, Guix has better rollback capacity than Arch and is about as easy to package for.
[22:29:40] <ButterNoodle> there really isnt any rollback in arch unless u use a user package or the arch-wayback machine
[22:29:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Indeed. Which means breakage is a bitch to fix.
[22:29:55] <ButterNoodle> which is nice
[22:30:18] <ButterNoodle> I will say there was a period of time where I was assed up every time I updated arch..
[22:30:38] <ButterNoodle> and was a real bother to the user community bitching about their lack of testing
[22:30:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> While it has been a lot more stable in the last few years, the lack of the feature still grates on me.
[22:31:02] <ButterNoodle> *I soldiered on - and have been running arch since 2005
[22:31:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But mainly I like my easily reproducible setup and sane dependency management.
[22:31:13] <ButterNoodle> I like alpine also
[22:31:45] <ButterNoodle> yea nix does make it repeatable, instead of using some kickstart or ansible to replicate nodes
[22:32:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's a godsend for dev work too.
[22:32:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "Works on my machine uwu"
[22:32:19] <ButterNoodle> absolutely.. eliminates that nonsense
[22:32:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Just grab a manifest, load it with guix environment and there ya go
[22:32:38] <ButterNoodle> relatively sterile environment with the flip of a config string
[22:33:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Forcing all packages to be recompiled with certain security options is also relatively easy.
[22:33:36] <ButterNoodle> tbh, I cant say I hate any one distro of linux... they all have relevant application
[22:33:52] <ButterNoodle> I think I have test vm's of most stuff in my lab
[22:34:03] <ButterNoodle> but ask me how I feel about bsd
[22:34:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's mostly that some have applications I don't relate to in terms of having a use for them.
[22:34:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Gentoo is on the performance end of tradeoff perf vs security.
[22:34:21] * ButterNoodle hunkers down in preperation to shit on bsd
[22:34:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And I am basically on the other end.
[22:34:50] <ButterNoodle> it all depends on ur practical application

[22:36:38] <ButterNoodle> snack 30
[22:36:46] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981 fix my windowsx
[22:36:55] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose I ended up solving my problem. Wanna know the issue. pipewire-pulseaudio doesn't support changing bit depths per sink at all. I ultimately had to roll back to pulseaudio to change things, and succeeded, and fixed my problems.
[22:37:12] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: what distro?
[22:37:31] <emmeka> like the command I was using was supposed to work, for pulseaudio, and thus nominally for pipewire-pulseaudio but it just doesn't have that feature right now
[22:37:45] <emmeka> ButterNoodle Fedora 34. Which switched to pipewire by default from 33
[22:37:52] <ButterNoodle> ic
[22:38:05] <ButterNoodle> that shit should just work as tested as it is
[22:38:23] <lastonestanding> fedora is for asshats
[22:38:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: Oh. Well that's bad.
[22:38:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: I don't suppose patching pipewire to use the depth you wanted for everything was an option?
[22:39:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> lastonestanding: Meh, it's not awful.
[22:40:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But the yearly upgrading is an annoying model I don't feel like dealing with.
[22:40:40] <lastonestanding> isn't yearly preferable to weekly or even daily?
[22:41:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> lastonestanding: Rolling releases tend to not have it be so disruptive and annoying since they're engineered around it.
[22:41:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Whereas non-rolling tend to make upgrading always feel like a half-assed downtime-causing disruption
[22:41:48] <lastonestanding> engineered of giving the users constant trouble?
[22:41:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> lastonestanding: No see, the shitty ones do that.
[22:42:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Guix and Nix don't.
[22:42:07] <lastonestanding> aha
[22:43:42] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose it might've been. But it doesn't matter now anyway: after messing around with the stuff in there a bit, I figured out that it was sample rate and not bit depth causing me problems. 32 bit 32khz works fine. So I'm switching back to pipewire now, since I can change JUST the sample rate in pipewire.
[22:44:11] <emmeka> by just setting up a config file
[22:44:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah I see
[22:44:34] <lastonestanding> https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/releases#0.3.32
[22:44:36] <ImoutoBot> [title] Releases · PipeWire / pipewire · GitLab
[22:44:38] <emmeka> this was much easier in pulseaudio though, kind of annoying
[22:45:02] <emmeka> <Aurora_v_kosmose> But the yearly upgrading is an annoying model I don't feel like dealing with. -- it's actually trivial, though
[22:45:23] <emmeka> you can do full version updates in the command line and it is basically no different than a normal update + a restart
[22:46:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: If nothing goes wrong and nothing requires manual intervention, which is a big if.
[22:46:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Every upgrade of non-rolling systems I've done required such manual steps.
[22:46:17] <emmeka> it never has for me, so long as I throw on --allowerasing
[22:46:36] <emmeka> Fedora version changes are very small changes, there's a new version every 6 months or so.
[22:46:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: That's for Arch, which is rolling.
[22:46:47] *** Quits: darkwitch (~darkwitch@user/darkwitch) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:46:47] <emmeka> well, breaking things in Arch isn't too surprising
[22:46:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah, Fedora has that too. I see
[22:46:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I meant the erasing ibt
[22:48:19] <emmeka> sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=34 --allowerasing, and then once that's finished installing, dnf system-upgrade reboot. And it just works, and takes no time. I've updated Fedora at least 10 times that way.
[22:48:44] <emmeka> I like it better than rolling release... and better than distros with huge changes less frequently
[22:49:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That last one is the most disruptive one, yes.
[22:49:44] <emmeka> I find rolling release distros tend to break things sort of continuously, requiring constant minor maintenance
[22:50:23] <lastonestanding> it can be fun
[22:50:29] <lastonestanding> like solving puzzles
[22:50:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hm, if something breaks on Guix I just rollback and wait until someone fixes it properly.
[22:51:09] <emmeka> it's not a bad thing, and fwiw, Fedora does have a rolling release bleeding edge spin called Rawhide.
[22:51:25] <emmeka> but it's just not what I want to boot up to in the morning
[22:51:38] <lastonestanding> doesn't every major distro have that?
[22:51:44] <emmeka> I like being able to do "big changes" whenever I have the time to sort out any potential issues.
[22:51:50] <lastonestanding> a development branch/release
[22:51:50] <emmeka> lastonestanding possibly?
[22:51:58] <emmeka> sure, but are they all rolling release?
[22:52:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Probably, but no one sane will do their daily computing on Debian unstable
[22:52:11] <lastonestanding> kinda
[22:54:10] <emmeka> brb, restarting to get pipewire going again and have everything all proper...

[22:54:42] <lastonestanding> that's for noobs
[22:54:45] <emmeka> yeah yeah
[22:55:09] <mathu> the issues i have on gentoo are dep cycles and blocks due to not updating my software nearly regularly enough. after resolving them i haven't actually had any technical issues in a few years. but i think that's probably because i have basically five packages i want to work: nvidia-drivers, xorg-server, awesomewm, firefox, and pulseaudio :P
[22:55:39] <mathu> haven't tried to see if my cross compilation setup still works
[22:55:44] <mathu> or android development setup
[22:56:02] <mathu> i should look into zig next time i need to cross-compile stuff
[22:56:14] <lastonestanding> why not use a container?
[22:56:17] <emmeka> lastonestanding need to change some config file stuff though, and killing it and restarting it made it behave weirdly considering I have in this session uninstalled pulseaudio, installed pipewire, and changed .conf shit
[22:56:28] <emmeka> so, I'm off to the pleb route

[22:57:30] <lastonestanding> you
[22:57:49] <mathu> why fix what isn't broken
[22:57:53] <lastonestanding> do you know docking?
[22:58:29] <mathu> i know what docker is but have somewhat more experience with lxc and systemd containers
[22:58:43] <lastonestanding> nice
[22:59:03] <lastonestanding> apparently docking does not mean using docker
[22:59:03] <mathu> and nsjail but that isn't containering
[22:59:10] <mathu> it's also a sex act
[22:59:19] <lastonestanding> yeah
[22:59:34] <lastonestanding> "A very intimate and intense sexual act performed by two uncircumcised men. Guy one pulls his foreskin back and holds it while guy two stretches his open and outward as far as possible over the head and shaft of guy one's penis."
[22:59:54] <mathu> wonder if docker ever tried to make that "docking" verb catch on or if they always knew
[23:00:29] <lastonestanding> and I wonder if men really do that docking thing...
[23:00:33] <mathu> there's a brunch place in my city that serves waffles made with a blue grain, described in the menu item description as blue waffles. i wonder if they know what that means to people who have been online a while
[23:01:37] <lastonestanding> well, I have no clue
[23:01:49] <lastonestanding> blue waffle is not something I would want to try
[23:02:02] <lastonestanding> reminds me of blue Fanta
