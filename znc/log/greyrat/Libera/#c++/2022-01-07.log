[03:06:34] <RandomReader> it'd be forcing everyone to write unnecessary statements, which could be messy if it requires constructor params from somewhere
[03:07:00] <RandomReader> an alternative would be annotating, maybe along the lines of [[fallthrough]], but I haven't seen anyone flesh that out
[03:08:13] <anyone> LargeT foo() { if (!x) never_return(); return make_large_foo; }  averted having to make a messy constructor call. Problem solved ;-)

[07:57:22] <leduyquang753> That's not what `auto` does.
[07:57:38] <leduyquang753> You can write `decltype(a) b;`.

[12:25:56] <Xardas> Why is it a poor motivation ? :D
[12:26:20] <ville> Xardas: if the solutions to code competitions are essentially one-offs and throw-away code you don't maintain over time, then there is a chance you will miss out learning about what sort of solutions don't suck in the long run

[16:30:12] <PJBoy> much better
[16:30:26] <RandomReader> neure - in the original, you didn't follow Rule of 5
[16:30:49] <RandomReader> (specifically, you declared a destructor in Key_binding, which suppresses auto-generation of other members)

[16:32:17] <PJBoy> there was move assignment in the OG

[16:32:43] <PJBoy> does that not get the implicit move ctor? :/

[16:37:44] <RandomReader> no
[16:37:54] <RandomReader> inheritance has nothing to do with this
[16:38:46] <RandomReader> the issue is that you declared a destructor in Key_binding, and nothing else .. meaning there's some kind of special behavior for this type, and so the compiler isn't going to assume it has any reasonable idea what a default move etc should look like

[17:52:53] <Schrostfutz> Hi, I want to have the first and last value of an inputstream, I'm not really interested in the rest. Is there a nice way to do this?
[17:54:36] <Oxyd> Sure. Read all the values and keep only the first and last.

[18:12:19] <pa> is it ok to erase elements of a map or unordered_map within a loop iterating the map itself?
[18:15:33] <irrenhaus3> pa: yes. maps are associative containers, so only the iterators to the erased elements are invalidated; you can keep iterating over the rest just fine
[18:15:43] <Eelis> pa: yeah but if you erase an element, you gotta do i=m.erase(i) instead of i++

[18:17:09] <Eelis> pa: no, because then you're incrementing i after removing the element it refers to, which is not allowed
[18:17:15] <Eelis> because removing the element invalidates the iterator

[18:50:32] <CarloWood> I have the following problem: I want the constructor of a base class to do all initialization, so that I can add members to that class that need the initialization of the member above them to be finished before they themselves are constructed. However, that initialization will depend on virtual functions of the derived class...
[18:50:37] <CarloWood> { B b; } struct A { A() { f(); } virtual void f() { cout << "A::f"; } }; struct B : A { void f() { cout << "B::f"; } };
[18:50:38] <geordi> A::f
[18:51:07] <CarloWood> And at the moment of calling A(), the constructor of the base class, those virtual functions can't be called yet? :/

[20:13:57] <sedeki> are you saying that access is exponential in sets?
[20:14:07] <PJBoy> nope
[20:14:19] <PJBoy> see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/lower_bound#Complexity
[20:21:41] <pa> the alternative would be to keep a map index, batch removals, and update the index for a batch in O(n)
[20:22:24] <pa> actually not even sure that's possible..
[20:23:55] <pa> this would require a map able to index both ways
[20:24:55] <Eelis> you can make containers with multiple indices with boost.multi_index

[20:34:43] <Schrostfutz_> I defined an operator>> for a type to read a list of values via an istream_iterator like so: `std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, Coord& c)`. This doesn't compile, because the compiler can't find the correct template, it lists all of the unfitting ones instead. Did I make a mistake in the signature?

[20:45:02] <Schrostfutz_> anyone: Hm, you're right, I also tried producing a minimal sample, that works... I can define operators for arbitrary types, even if they are declared elsewhere, right?
[20:45:17] <anyone> Schrostfutz_: if they don't conflict, I guess yes
[20:46:00] <Eelis> Schrostfutz_: use of the operator<<s will only be convenient if they comply with the ADL requirement that they're declared in a namespace related to one of the parameter types
[20:46:02] <anyone> Eelis: I was probably thinking about some stupid access pattern, like  for (const auto &e : set) { set[e.first]++; }
[20:47:28] <Schrostfutz_> I define the operator in no namespace, directly ahead of the function that attempts to use it
[20:47:59] <anyone> it's even more prominent in other languages like perl foreach (keys %map) { $map[$_]++; } that's quite n*log(n) if I'm not mistaken
[20:49:32] <sedeki> anyone yes you're right. i was a bit too quick
[20:50:33] <Schrostfutz_> Eelis: Oh wow, that was indeed the problem! Is there a downside to defining an operator in a "foreign" namespace, if I keep it in a implementation file?
