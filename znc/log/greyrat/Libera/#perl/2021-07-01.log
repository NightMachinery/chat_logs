[00:37:01] <leitz> If the close($fh); is there, it errors. 
[00:37:16] <Grinnz> "errors"?
[00:37:25] <Grinnz> close doesn't throw exceptions
[00:37:50] *** Quits: Judabuda (~ok@user/judabuda) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:37:54] <Grinnz> but the problem is that do block is discarding the contents it read, and then returning close()
[00:38:21] <Grinnz> also the close is unnecessary; it will be closed at the end of that scope
[00:38:27] *** Joins: Judabuda (~ok@user/judabuda)
[00:39:09] <leitz> Ah, makes sense on what it returns. I'm going through some perlcritic results and trying to learn and clean up at the same time.
[00:39:15] <Bossi> hi, how to track down   "Error in `/usr/bin/perl': double free or corruption"
[00:39:33] <Grinnz> if you're using the core perlcritic theme, note that several of those policies are stupid
[00:39:38] *** Joins: kitsunenokenja (~kitsunech@68.91.220.96)
[00:40:11] <leitz> Grinnz, just starting out with it, seeing how it makes things look. So far it's...well...
[00:40:19] <Grinnz> perlbot: perlcritic
[00:40:19] <perlbot> Grinnz: a highly configurable and extensible Perl source code analyzer. Comes with policies based on Perl Best Practices (PBP); but see http://p3rl.org/Perl::Critic::Community for our recommendations.
[00:43:06] <pflanze> I've always believed that calling close (*and checking its return value*, which this code was missing anyway) is necessary to give the OS a last chance to tell about errors.
[00:43:35] <pflanze> Especially since since <$fh> does not allow to check for errors in Perl.
[00:43:49] <Grinnz> it's useful for pipes, but doesn't really do anything useful for files due to how i/o works
[00:43:51] <ehuelsmann[m]> pflanze: I generally treat close() return values as warnings.
[00:44:02] <pflanze> Grinnz, there can always be bad blocks.
[00:44:28] <pflanze> Or the drive unplugged, whatever.
[00:44:32] <ehuelsmann[m]> pflanze: shouldn't that have been reported on write()?
[00:44:41] <Grinnz> on read/write yes, not on close
[00:44:59] <pflanze> OK, that may be.
[00:45:14] <ehuelsmann[m]> also, I doubt that the error on the bad blocks would even show on close, because close() doesn't flush().
[00:45:31] <pflanze> I was always hoping that the kernel would give an error on close, too, since <$fh> doesn't report read errors. Maybe that was a false hope.
[00:45:39] <Grinnz> yeah... "due to how i/o works" meaning most of this stuff gets obscured by buffering that isn't even known to perl
[00:46:32] <pflanze> I know that read errors (when reading from disk, not disk cache) *are* reported to user space.
[00:46:39] <Grinnz> pipes/sockets tend to have more useful error states though
[00:46:44] <pflanze> I just don't know the details about in which syscalls.
[00:47:25] <pflanze> man 2 close actually says that close can report EIO. Whatever that means.
[00:47:34] <pflanze> I guess that may be the socket case.
[00:52:17] <Bossi> from man 2 close "A  successful close does not guarantee that the data has been successfully saved to disk,"
[00:54:18] <curdlesnoot> pflanze: regarding <$fh>, you can check the value of $!, as explained by the documentation for readline (which is what it is).
[00:54:19] <Grinnz> it usually guarantees that a subsequent read will see the data as if it were, but yeah what happened in hardware is up to caching
[00:54:48] <OnlineCop> If I want to preserve $text when doing a =~ substitution, do I need to copy the contents of $text first?
[00:55:11] <ehuelsmann[m]> OnlineCop: which Perl version are you using?
[00:55:18] <Grinnz> (my $copy = $text) =~ s///; or on perl 5.14+, my $copy = $text =~ s///r;
[00:55:33] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. that.
[00:55:42] <OnlineCop> One of the 5's. Different on each of my machines. :D
[00:56:08] <OnlineCop> Okay, so $copy stays the same and $text gets modified?
[00:56:16] <ehuelsmann[m]> as long as the number is 5.14 or higher, use Grinnz's second example.
[00:56:32] <Grinnz> no, $copy is modified
[00:56:58] <OnlineCop> Cool; that's what I wanted. I didn't see that in perlop...
[00:57:21] <genio> s///r is a _really_ nice feature
[00:57:38] <Grinnz> OnlineCop: because =~ is not an operator, s/// is
[00:57:41] <genio> (whoever added that)++
[00:58:00] <pflanze> curdlesnoot, ah, I forgot about this. Actually my Chj::IO::File (not meant to stay) does this.

[02:17:26] <Grinnz> looks pretty consistent to me; the second one there's just no \E to end the escaping
[02:18:00] <Grinnz> (because the backslash is backslashed, and so isn't part of the escape sequence)
[02:18:23] <OnlineCop> A double-backslash doesn't match, though.
[02:18:39] <Grinnz> doesn't it?
[02:18:58] <Grinnz> looks like it matched \\ fine
[02:19:11] <OnlineCop> \Q\\\E matches \\ but a single \Q\\E doesn't match \
[02:19:30] <Grinnz> yes, because \Q\\E is the literal three characters \\E
[02:19:41] <Grinnz> and there's no E
[02:20:10] <OnlineCop> I thought everything between \Q and its \E would be literals, including any \
[02:20:20] <Grinnz> well, not exactly but yes
[02:20:29] <Grinnz> but there's no \E escape sequence in that one
[02:20:31] <OnlineCop> Like,  \Q\"\E matches \ followed by "
[02:20:32] <Grinnz> because the \ is \'d
[02:21:34] <Grinnz> it goes like this: \Q\\E -> quotemeta( character<\> . character<E> ) -> \\E
[02:22:33] <Grinnz> \\E is a backslash followed by an E; \\\E is a backslash followed by a \E escape

[02:23:40] <Grinnz> that's where it gets funky - i think the quotemeta happens before the unquoting
[02:24:06] <OnlineCop> Does it have to do with quotemeta() seeing a double quote as a doesn't-need-to-be-quoted, so it changes the \ before it to an escaped \ ?

[02:28:43] <Grinnz> it looks like it's quotemeta-ing after the unquoting, but then s/// is using the quoted backslashes literally
[02:29:24] <Grinnz> i think this is an unfortunate interaction with quotemeta being much more general than just "make regexes match literally"

[04:39:52] <mst> one of the aggravating things on IRC is that we often get a question we've been asked a hundred times before and it's theoretically annoying but the person -asking- it is only asking it for the first time so there's no call to be mean to them - to avoid people being snippy when responding to such questions we set them up as bot factoids so people can just trigger the information without accidentally being cranky
[04:41:53] <simcop2387> yea we do our best to not be stack overflow here
[04:43:10] <Grinnz> whereas on stackoverflow they just mark your post as duplicate and yell at you for not searching first (nothing against stack overflow, it's great for what it is which is google search manipulation)
[04:44:12] <simcop2387> i've seen times where someone edits your question to be slightly different so that they have an answer that applies to the new question, and then it gets closed as a duplicate of a question you didn't ask because of that

[04:45:33] <simcop2387> Grinnz: yea the whole tensorflow section of things on there is ripe for that kind of thing.
[04:45:34] <Grinnz> it's not designed for teaching or solving the real problem

[04:53:57] <Bossi> i tried creating threads for each data record i want to analyze, but thread creation puts a lot of time on everything, so i changed the concept to use a threadpool with inqueue and outqueue, need only initialized once,  and then speeds goes up through the ceiling

[05:13:47] <tejr> mst: I think I've got it now
[05:14:33] <mst> NewAndScaredButH: ok, immediate guess, that 'Assertion Failed' thing you said was the error you saw will be from one of the Athena::Util::Assert functions
[05:14:52] <mst> NewAndScaredButH: if you install Devel::Confess you can get a full stack trace by running the piece of code with 'perl -d:Confess'
[05:15:01] <nirnam> just saying, in theory can one make : memoize into an sub attribute? like raku is cached
[05:16:11] <NewAndScaredButH> mst ah okay! that is very cool! So I would asdd that to the script at the top like use Devel::Confess and then use 'perl -d:Confess' in the cmdline? 
[05:16:31] <mst> NewAndScaredButH: you don't need to add the 'use'
[05:16:49] <mst> NewAndScaredButH: 'perl -d:Confess' on the commandline is enough
[05:16:52] <NewAndScaredButH> okay got it!
[05:17:24] <mst> nirnam: I really dislike attributes' implementation but, yes, somebody already did that in 2013: https://metacpan.org/pod/Attribute::Memoize
[05:17:24] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Attribute::Memoize - A Memoize attribute - metacpan.org ]
[05:17:55] <nirnam> splendid
[05:18:29] <mst> nirnam: note, attributes do have limitations and I'm often not a fan, but they are pretty powerful
[05:18:36] <mst> personally I tend to prefer, instead of
[05:18:52] <mst> sub foo (...) :Blah(...) { ... }
[05:19:06] <mst> blah '...' => foo => sub (...) { ... ]
[05:20:19] <nirnam> I am probably not gonna using these, I did a little dip into raku for awhile and they have alot of great thing that I want it in perl
[05:20:23] <mst> NewAndScaredButH: '-d' means 'load the debugger' but perl has pluggable debugger implementations, and Devel::Confess just adds backtraces to all warn()s and die()s but implements the pluggable debugger API so you can write '-d:Confess' instead of '-MDevel::Confess' for convenience
[05:20:52] <nirnam> I know all those thing that raku have make it bloat and slow, but I don't mind it as an option to have in perl5
[05:20:54] <mst> nirnam: totally fair, Moose was based on the perl6 v1 metamodel, and the current v2 metamodel that raku uses was significantly based on Moose
[05:21:22] <NewAndScaredButH> love it!! And would I run that command and then add on the exact file name after it so cmdl knows which file to run that on? mst
[05:21:30] <mst> nirnam: we've been stealing stuff from each other for years and it's glorious
[05:21:54] <nirnam> I'm gonna look into .hyper next
[05:21:59] <mst> NewAndScaredButH: I normally make sure I have a test case - i.e. a t/foo.t file - that produces the error - then run 'perl -d:Confess t/foo.t'
[05:22:15] <mst> NewAndScaredButH: but I have no idea if that suits your situation
[05:22:24] <NewAndScaredButH> Awesome I got you 
[05:23:14] <mst> NewAndScaredButH: oh, also, can I see the assert module?
[05:23:17] <NewAndScaredButH> are there any reasons NOT to run it without doing the test case first that has the error first? mst
[05:23:36] <NewAndScaredButH> and yes let me see how I can get that file
[05:24:21] <mst> NewAndScaredButH: I don't see any reasons not to tbh, the main thing here is "what's the shortest way we get to getting more info about the error"

[06:01:10] <NewAndScaredButH> I'm running this in re.pl - it is a script to migrate data from one database to a new database

[06:06:16] <Grinnz> normally you check if it's valid json by trying to decode it and catching the exception if it fails
[06:06:27] <Grinnz> then, if it is valid, you already have it decoded
[06:07:14] <Bossi> i go for speed, just checking the first view bytes, since i deal with very big json stuff sometimes

[06:13:03] <NewAndScaredButH> okay i got you
[06:13:26] <mst> NewAndScaredButH: I know what re.pl is -normally- but I also recognise that somebody else might've made something with the same name
[06:13:49] <NewAndScaredButH> ahh good point!

[06:46:26] <Bossi> while some of perl scripts still run after 2 decades without modifying at all or minor tweaking, python1 is already gone python 2 is meanwhile gone too, and you cant run most older code on python3
[06:46:47] <NewAndScaredButH> oooooo, okay tell me more wise one so I called an anonomous function?

[06:50:07] <mst> yes exactly, that __ANON__ thing was the re.pl running the line you typed
[06:50:12] <mst> then _HandleCarePlans was called
[06:50:17] <NewAndScaredButH> yep yep!
[06:50:22] <Bossi> but about the anecdote at PUG, we decided to do a little coding dojo, and i implemented the task in awk, perl and sh
[06:50:26] <mst> and we can see the USERNAME in there
[06:50:34] <NewAndScaredButH> right! 
[06:50:52] <mst> but that calls _MapScheduleToRecords
[06:51:07] <mst> and *that* seems to be upset that *it* doesn't have USERNAME
[06:51:18] <NewAndScaredButH> correct OHHHHH
[06:51:27] <mst> so you need to look at /home/nmacklin/nmacklinstreams/prod/perllib/Athena/Athena/CarePlan/Util/Migration.pm
[06:51:38] <mst> line 1444 is where the error is coming from
[06:51:56] <mst> either _HandleCarePlans didn't pass the USERNAME down correctly
[06:52:15] <mst> or _MapScheduleToRecords didn't -see- the USERNAME it had been passed correctly
[06:52:27] <mst> can't say which of the two without seeing Migration.pm
[06:52:36] <mst> but that's definitely your problem, one way or the other
[06:52:51] <NewAndScaredButH> okay yep yep YEP that's correct _HandleCarePlans does not pass a username at all (at least from what is in the _HandleCarePlans args 
[06:53:32] <mst> NewAndScaredButH: and then _MapScheduleToRecords wants a username, and can't find it, and the assertion fires
[06:53:55] <NewAndScaredButH> But I also tried, (in debugging) to just take out USERNAME for _MapScheduleToRecords and then it said TASKMAPPING (same line 1444) and the next argument in that method, was "missing"
[06:54:37] <mst> right, so instead of taking out USERNAME, try modifying the code to pass it
[06:54:56] <mst> it may be it finds TASKMAPPING on its own if USERNAME is there
[06:55:07] <mst> at least if it doesn't we've fixed -something-

[07:46:09] <Bossi> ok, verstehe, you wont run dry of beer
[07:46:49] <mst> I can't speak german worth shit but some things are important :D
[07:47:19] <Bossi> sure, i also can say good morning in japanese
[07:47:59] <mst> got that at a YAPC in germany (I think the frankfurt one) where I ordered a drink in english
[07:48:00] <Bossi> ah now figured where lancaster is located
[07:48:28] <mst> but then when the waitress came around again I heard a german person re-order the same thing I was drinking
[07:48:36] <Bossi> it happens that i dont live far away from FRA (Frankfurt/Main)
[07:48:40] <mst> so I parroted
[07:48:46] <mst> and it totally worked
[07:49:06] <mst> other perl hackers at the table went "wait, I didn't know you spoke german"
[07:49:14] <mst> to which my reply was "yeah, cos I don't"
[07:49:16] <Bossi> lol
[07:49:35] <Bossi> you just observed an order and tried the same
[07:50:31] <Bossi> i'm still stuck with my threads-problem, but to make it worse my Net::Patricia data also does not work while running multithreaded :/

[07:55:43] <Bossi> i will have a look into it, but unfortunately time is running out, project is several months late due to several reasons and currently my mental situation is problematic
[07:55:59] <Sauvin> mst, good morning, miscreant.
[07:56:14] <Bossi> i see, you're good friends :D
[07:56:22] <Sauvin> Fucking A.
[07:56:40] <mst> Bossi: I know that problem but debugging threads.pm sucks for -my- mental health and most of the regulars here
[07:57:06] <mst> also, yeah, if that wasn't friendly, it'd've been a kickban ;0
[07:57:13] <Sauvin> I have a simple solution for debugging threads.pm. Don't use it.
[07:57:50] <Bossi> the first issue with it was also caused by Net::Patricia somewho, i was able to track it down by removing changes of 2 days, but now it can be every object
[07:58:07] <mst> right, p3rl.org/threads#WARNING
[07:58:25] <mst> says that even the people who write perl itself are saying "please don't"
[07:59:10] <Bossi> Sauvin, i got this advice already, but i share a lot of data and for quite a long time it worked like a charm, when you dont start and stop threads continuesly
[07:59:12] <Sauvin> Can't remember details, but I DO remember trying threads back in 1997 or so. Pushed CPU usage up through the roof.
[07:59:41] <Sauvin> And now you have problems? :\
[07:59:44] <mst> Bossi: yes, I agree, it works ... until it doesn't
[07:59:48] <Bossi> hmm, i remember my first try with perl-threads, was also back in the 90s, and dropped it that time

[08:00:31] <Sauvin> Honestly, I seem to have far better luck pushing data to another process and having IT do the sharing.
[08:00:53] <mst> Bossi: I'm not trying to be a dick here, just explaining what the people here to provide help for free for fun are wanting to help with and why
[08:01:19] <Sauvin> Eh, I'm just a know-it-all buttinsky.
[08:01:29] <mst> Sauvin: if you ever do need that, p3rl.org/Parallel::Map is a module I wrote for sysadmin friends to distribute things across cores via fork
[08:01:56] <Bossi> i saw that, i apprechiate the attitude, and not turning ppl down by just saying "dont do this or that"
[08:01:59] *** Joins: akaWolf (~akaWolf@akawolf.org)
[08:03:00] <Sauvin> Bossi, in another channel, we have folks of all different levels of experience. Some have virtually none. When they come in asking why this or that doesn't work, one of the first things we'll ask is "what are you trying to do?"
[08:03:03] <mst> Bossi: we think threads.pm is a terrible idea, but we can't and won't stop you, just, it's not fun to help with stuff we hate, y'know?
[08:03:32] <Sauvin> Folks sometimes get frustrated with that kind of approach and demand "Just answer the question, godamnit it!" - maybe we will, maybe we won't. 
[08:03:58] <Bossi> i know, i work with unix since mid of 80s, in early 90s i ported software on almost any existing unix platform around
[08:04:02] <mst> it's clear Bossi appreciated the "you're not eval, we're just not gonna help with that" attitude of here though
[08:04:05] <Sauvin> What we really mean when we asking that question is: "maybe you're using the wrong tools, or maybe you're using the right tools in the wrong way, or maybe you don't understand the problem you're really trying to solve".
[08:04:28] <Adura> MCE seems pretty interesting.
[08:04:30] <Bossi> and i hunted stack errors, buffer overflows, sometimes for weeks till i found the reason

[08:09:22] <mst> Bossi: oh, hell yeah, I know that feeling
[08:10:15] <Bossi> someday in was it late 92 or early 93 my unix on my 386 stopped working, and i tried to reinstall it for 3 days, inserting debugging output in the installation scripts, it was lying to me, it said "can not create filesystem ..." and shut down the system, since they didnt offer a rescue shell
[08:11:07] <Bossi> at that day Linux came into my life, installed it within 45 minutes ...
[08:11:40] <Bossi> as far as i remember it was kernel 0.99pl4
[08:11:42] * mst remembers being the dev system admin at a software house in 2001
[08:12:15] <mst> trying to figure out why the Tru64 Alpha server wouldn't talk to anybody
[08:12:47] <mst> took me an hour of fucking around at the console to realise that the rc scripts were in /sbin/rc.d not /etc/rc.d
[08:13:28] <mst> then another 5 minutes to realise one of the developers had broken into the network closet and stolen its patch port
[08:13:33] <Sauvin> That's retarded. :\
[08:13:57] <Bossi> yeah i see, you had also your learning curve. i've not just ported software but also managed several different systems in the 90s
[08:14:01] <mst> Sauvin: the /sbin thing was fair enough
[08:14:13] <mst> the "developer tried to repatch things" was not
[08:14:39] <Sauvin> I just installed shit on my 386 and swore at it.
[08:14:50] <Bossi> the famous SINIX from Siemens, had universes, so you could switch between sinix, sysv and bsd

[08:32:31] <Bossi> you should more like threaten them by installing some BSD

[08:33:21] <mst> Bossi: I wouldn't inflict both people on the BSDs ;)
[08:33:57] <Sauvin> Thing is, the BSDs are fucking picky about what kind of machine they'll run on. That lets out most machines you can get from Walmart.

[08:35:53] <mst> Bossi: aye
[08:36:13] <Bossi> one day i arrived at the customers office ... and they said "something had happened ..."
[08:36:53] <Sauvin> mst, of all the *nix you've used over the years, which did/do you like best?
[08:37:04] <Bossi> the remaining half of the day i sat in the basement installing an Ultrix machine from scratch from a TK60 tape
[08:37:27] <mst> Sauvin: tricky question
[08:37:44] <Sauvin> Not really. "I don't really know" is a valid answer.
[08:38:02] <mst> Sauvin: no, genuinely tricky
[08:38:19] <Bossi> what happened ... during the night a cron job was started to do some backup ... one part of that was to rsh to the Ultrix machine and carry out "cd .....; rm -rf *"
[08:38:35] <Sauvin> Oh fuck...
[08:38:47] <mst> - thing that did exactly what it said on the tin: SunOS 5.5 which said SysVr4 and was absolutely that which was in its own way ace
[08:39:02] <Bossi> so, the path where the cd should go didnt exist ... the rm had no mercy
[08:39:04] <mst> - thing that I could rely on everywhere; netBSD + pkgsrc
[08:39:14] <mst> - thing that was built by adults: FreeBSD
[08:39:42] <mst> - thing that gave me a linux kernel but was still mostly built by adults: Debian
[08:40:12] <mst> I also for a while did slackware with pkgsrc
[08:40:48] <mst> Sauvin: so yeah, that's why it's a tricky question, because i loved all of them in their contexts
[08:41:10] <Bossi> so my answer would be ... depends
[08:41:34] <mst> Bossi: well that's why I said that
[08:41:50] <mst> Bossi: just I gave details rather than an adult diaper brand :P
[08:42:00] <Bossi> Sun broke with the open source world when they started to bundle their c-compiler
[08:42:50] <mst> (also forget depends, if you're going to argue -that- right you want Abena M4 or Molicare Slip Maxi or Seni Quattro)
[08:42:51] <Bossi> i used to admin SunOS 5 from 1989 till 2006
[08:43:17] <Sauvin> You answered "Assurance"? I missed it.
[08:44:10] <mst> Bossi: yeah, I had sun's history group finding install media for me, so much "fun"
[08:44:18] <Bossi> i still own some ancient hardware, my first computer is CBM 4032 (Commodore Business Machines)
[08:45:59] <Sauvin> I remember wanting one of those, but at the time I did NOT have the $$$.
[08:46:16] <Bossi> after that i got a VC20, C64 and then turned to an Atari ST, where i started to run OS9, my first *nixis OS
[08:47:25] <Sauvin> My first experience with *nix was Coherent, which did NOT want to run on a 286 but did well enough on a 386.
[08:47:42] <Sauvin> And then I got a shell account, think it was Solaris but it might have been 386BSD.
[08:48:03] <Sauvin> So, first chance I got, you want to bet I put Linux on a personal machine!
[08:48:04] <Bossi> i remember stories of XENIX running on 286, and when you look at the source code you see a lot of "Microsoft"
[08:53:57] <Bossi> my first shell account was on a Altos machine

[20:19:04] <Botje-> LeoNerd: realistically, never. only series that made it past 34 is 2.4.x
[20:19:07] <simcop2387> thrig: we have to use mercurial for that then just like firefox

[21:05:14] <ether> you need to account for grapheme width to ensure columns line up?
[21:05:21] <huf> i dont think LeoNerd's asking how to do it
[21:05:29] <LeoNerd> eval: sprintf "%-40s| %s", "cafÃ©", "here"
[21:05:31] <perlbot> LeoNerd: cafÃ©                                    | here
[21:05:44] <LeoNerd> ^-- if the word "cafe" was a bunch of weirder Unicode that I can't type here, then printf will get confused
[21:05:59] <LeoNerd> It is important that printf insert enough spaces such that the | falls on the 41st terminal column
[21:06:03] <ether> printf should be unicode-aware
[21:06:18] <LeoNerd> So it must be able to determine the terminal width of the word "cafÃ©". Currently it will either count bytes or codepoints. Neither is correct
[21:06:27] <thrig> I made the mistake of stepping gdb into printf(3) once
[21:06:40] <ether> actually no, you're right, it counts codepoints, not width. so you can't really use %-40s for alignment as you would expect

[21:07:17] <thrig> your perl-form kung-fu is no good

[23:14:38] <gordonfish> sweval: package Foo { our ($x, $y) = qw(abc def); sub x { 123 } sub y { 456 } } BEGIN { *Foo::x = *Foo::y } [ Foo::x, $Foo::x ];
[23:14:40] <perlbot> gordonfish: [456,"def"]
[23:16:01] <haarg> i'd generally recommend \&{$name} or \&{$glob} rather than *{$name}{CODE}

[23:23:16] <simcop2387> EvanCarroll: some syntactical sugar for it would be nice too, a :deprecated(newMethod) would be nice
[23:25:10] <simcop2387> hmm that might actually be a nice way to do some other things...
[23:26:04] * gordonfish wonders if it wouldn't just be easier to just remove the sub routine? :)
[23:26:43] <thrig> kill them all, the linker shall know his own
[23:28:48] <simcop2387> gordonfish: just use Vigil already then.  https://github.com/munificent/vigil

[23:53:14] <pragma-> lol, vigil's readme is hilarious
[23:53:28] <pragma-> it had me in the first half
[23:55:12] <pragma-> i've followed munificent's blog posts and his programming language books. i really thought he would make a language like this.
