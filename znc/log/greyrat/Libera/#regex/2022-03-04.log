[21:43:32] <re101-turkey-9> if i want to add three more special characters * - !
[21:43:41] <re101-turkey-9> how will the regex be
[21:43:49] <OnlineCop> More difficult.
[21:44:13] <re101-turkey-9> it should match ---    !!!
[21:44:15] <purplex> i just edited it to make it a lookahead https://regex101.com/r/ONBgHS/3
[21:46:14] <re101-turkey-9> total four special characters #*-!
[21:46:18] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/ONBgHS/4
[21:46:38] <re101-turkey-9> they should match only identical characters which are repeated thrice or more than thrice
[21:46:39] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/ONBgHS/5
[21:47:15] <OnlineCop> 3 or more (with no max limit) would be `{2,}` or with a max of 5 would be "one less" in that range: `{2,4}`
[21:47:39] <OnlineCop> Also, don't use 's' since that means `.*` matches newlines as well.
[21:48:46] <purplex> another possibility i had in mind https://regex101.com/r/ONBgHS/6
[21:49:30] <purplex> maybe it allows you to control each character 
[21:50:42] <OnlineCop> That's not a bad idea either. More readable, and doesn't have that capture.
[21:51:08] <OnlineCop> Also has the flexibility of changing only !{12,} if you want, without affecting any of the others.
[21:52:53] <purplex> but yours matches something like --#----!!
[21:53:21] <purplex> while mine doesn't so it seems slightly different in 'purpose'
[21:57:34] <OnlineCop> You probably just need to wrap the stuff after the `(?=.*` to the `)` within a group.

[21:57:59] <purplex> yes https://regex101.com/r/ONBgHS/7

[22:32:58] <re101-turkey-9> okay Thanks alot
[22:33:45] <OnlineCop> I'd probably go with line 1.
[22:33:59] <re101-turkey-9> okay
[22:34:22] <OnlineCop> To me, it's simply a matter of being more readable. "I want three of #. Or, I want three of !. Or, I want three of -."
[22:35:11] <re101-turkey-9> yes, three or more than three
[22:36:25] <OnlineCop> Right. Trying to do a capture group then matching "one less than" however many you wanted is much less readable. I like purplex's design of breaking each one up so it's easier to read and understand.
[22:38:36] <re101-turkey-9> these three are same right?
