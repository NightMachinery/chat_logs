[00:03:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> there's a 1968 Chevrolet C10 online right now
[00:03:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> guy wants a bit more than i'd spend but thats an asking price lol
[00:03:33] <AnonymooseReddtr> he also has a 68 Mercury M100, and a 68 Ford F250
[00:03:35] <AnonymooseReddtr> all for sale
[00:03:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> and a 79 bronco.. that is a slick truck lol
[00:03:48] <vinrock> i love the old trucks but rust is tough to avoid
[00:04:02] <vinrock> oh the new broncho just finally started deliveries
[00:04:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> yea
[00:04:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> the C10 looks decent 
[00:04:14] <vinrock> i havent seen one yet tho
[00:04:17] <AnonymooseReddtr> he wants $9k CAD for it
[00:04:22] <vinrock> just shit shitty af bronco sport
[00:04:29] <vinrock> not bad
[00:04:30] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah the bronco sport is dumb
[00:04:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> the 68 F250 he wants $6500
[00:04:50] <vinrock> do you guys salt your roads
[00:04:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> yes 
[00:05:04] <AnonymooseReddtr> there's no way these are local trucks though
[00:05:19] <vinrock> id imagine a chevy living in canada for 53 years is gona be fulla holes
[00:05:22] <vinrock> ah
[00:05:29] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah
[00:05:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> exactly vinrock
[00:05:38] <AnonymooseReddtr> there is def. some rust here
[00:05:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> but they dont' look bad
[00:05:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> pic wise
[00:05:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> would need work
[00:05:53] <vinrock> you gotta look at the surface rust on the frame
[00:05:57] <technonerd_> desert trucks ++
[00:05:58] <vinrock> make sure it didnt thin out too much
[00:06:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> aye

[00:06:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> buddy of mine is a "car guy"
[00:06:52] <AnonymooseReddtr> he's working on a 66 mustang atm
[00:06:54] <vinrock> technonerd_, you go out west and its like everybody is driving a prerunner
[00:07:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> IF i did this i'd be getting him to come with me
[00:07:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> and it would likely live at his shop for a bit anyway
[00:07:38] <vinrock> im gona build something in a couple years when I go back to a car for my daily driver
[00:07:50] <vinrock> lookin to do a ~2000 land cruiser with a mercedes diesel
[00:07:55] <AnonymooseReddtr> see thats the thing I don't drive anywhere right now
[00:08:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> my daily driver is  2012 camry with 130k 
[00:08:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> KM on it
[00:08:16] <vinrock> well
[00:08:17] <AnonymooseReddtr> 80k miles
[00:08:25] <vinrock> at least its a camry and is probably still worth a boatload of money
[00:08:28] <AnonymooseReddtr> it is
[00:08:32] <AnonymooseReddtr> its worth about $7k
[00:08:38] <vinrock> SE, XL, XLE...?

[00:08:45] <vinrock> nice
[00:08:49] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah 
[00:08:52] <int0x1C8> every car I've had in my life has been a camry
[00:08:52] <AnonymooseReddtr> its a nice car
[00:08:54] <AnonymooseReddtr> boring as f.
[00:08:55] <vinrock> you can probably drive that to 300k and barely hurt the value
[00:09:01] <int0x1C8> ran them all into the ground
[00:09:14] <vinrock> toyota makes the best quality/value vehicles on earth
[00:09:17] <AnonymooseReddtr> i bought it 5 years ago with 6k km on it
[00:09:17] <vinrock> no competition
[00:09:25] <vinrock> yeah boring cars
[00:09:27] <vinrock> but fucking excellent
[00:09:41] <int0x1C8> my current camry is a 2007 with 190k on it I got for $4k

[09:28:35] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> Hopefully M$ realizes they made a mistake
[09:29:36] <JollyRgrs> really just depends on why they picked 8th gen
[09:29:56] <JollyRgrs> obv. there are much lower powered devices on the list, so it isn't just for pure power. must be some instruction set they are expecting
[09:30:27] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> It's still crossing a line because 6th gen is still good

[09:32:34] <JollyRgrs> "still crossing a line"?
[09:32:55] <JollyRgrs> look, i get it, i got many devices in my house that are ~4th gen and i'm sad that they don't currently qualify for win11
[09:33:16] <JollyRgrs> but I don't know yet WHY they picked 8th gen, so I need to hear that out before I get all upset about it
[09:33:42] <JollyRgrs> MSFT's goal is to have x many installs of their new OS, so I doubt they are purposely trying to stop some from upgrading
[09:34:34] <JollyRgrs> most likely there is a technical reason why, and until I hear more, I won't know why and can't be sure whether MS can backtrack and find a way to make more of the CPUs compatible (possibly with a feature reduction). My guess is something about security
[09:35:10] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> I don't mind losing a few features to get it onto 6th gen, and 7th.
[09:35:47] <JollyRgrs> well, it is more of a question of "will allowing lesser secure devices cause a security vuln in the ones already compatible"
[09:36:09] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> I mean it took them years to get Win10 where it is and they want to break the userbase up again
[09:36:10] <JollyRgrs> sure you don't mind... but does MSFT mind? will it screw up the requirements for something else if they let < 8th gen on win11?
[09:36:38] <JollyRgrs> i'm clearly talking to someone who doesn't understand, i need some sleep anyways
[09:36:47] <mkillebrew> I'm sitting here like "hah nerds, you have to buy a new computer, not like me with my macboo-- oh wait"

[21:07:45] <Alternity> i can definately tell the diff in games between 60 and 144hz
[21:07:51] <catbeard> k so, reasons why a left mouse click (after releasing) would sometimes "stick down" until i hit escape key

[21:08:46] <Alternity> <t​elgareith> I'm happy with 30FPS in my games // then just use a console and save yourself the money at that point
[21:09:01] <catbeard> maybe gnome Mouse settings?
[21:09:36] <catbeard> or perhaps incompatability with OpenRazer or maybe Gentoo has a bad driver for SteelSeries Sensei Ten
[21:11:00] <catbeard> or maybe the mButton mappings are off, and left click is like pseudo-mapped to drag or something?
[21:11:28] <catbeard> usually i don't move the mouse when clicking on a Tree Style Tab in firefox
[21:12:20] <catbeard> hell usually i don't even use the mouse, like just Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn to go down the tree 1 tab at a time if it's "within proximity" of the tab i'm currently on
[21:13:04] <catbeard> if it's like >3 tabs away or in another tab tree parent, i'll usually favor clicking the tab over ^PgUp/PgDn navigation
[21:13:28] <catbeard> mostly because of Great Tab Suspender, then each forgotten tab >10m old has to reload before i can tab down further
[21:14:01] <catbeard> <3 ff native discard api
[21:16:08] <catbeard> TST is nice also because instead of switching the tab focus, you can expand/collapse the other parent trees without "switching" to any of it's tabs
[21:16:46] <catbeard> making wikipedia middle click journeys fun again

[23:45:50] <seednode> Ah yes a second copy
[23:45:59] <seednode> Was the first link stored on a myBook?
[23:49:39] <aab_> all stored on a 4TB drive no redundanct
[23:49:42] <aab_> redundancy
[23:50:16] <seednode> We should limit the total amount of global information to 4TB, and everyone has a 4TB drive with a full replica of that dataset
[23:50:26] <seednode> Might require some reworking of everything, and abandoning media files
[23:50:30] <seednode> But think of the benefits!
[23:52:02] <Jaelae> work lifecyclled my laptop. got a new shiny one
[23:52:08] <Jaelae> and its gonna annoy the hell out of me
[23:52:14] <Jaelae> because my entire home setup doesnt work for it :\
[23:54:22] <aab_> seednode not going to happen lol it would be up to the end user to not have data online and have their own backup.  They need to limit their data set
[23:54:48] <seednode> It'll never happen, but it's ideal
[23:54:53] *** Quits: CableNinja (~Accidenta@user/cableninja) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:55:05] <seednode> Everyone gets 571 bytes of the global dataset all to themselves
[23:55:07] <seednode> Better be concise
[23:55:11] *** Joins: CableNinja (~Accidenta@2600:8802:6913:6b00:c9f1:9475:d871:83aa)

[23:55:11] *** Joins: CableNinja (~Accidenta@user/cableninja)
[23:55:26] <seednode> Actually we're over 7B people, let's call it 512 bytes
[23:55:54] *** Quits: yuken (~yuken@user/yuken) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:57:08] <aab_> people just need to cut down there data.  There is no way someone keeps 4TB of important data at home.  It will be all either music or videos.
[23:57:15] <aab_> that stuff isn't important
[23:57:23] <seednode> I mean
[23:57:25] <aab_> unless you work in movies or music that is
[23:57:28] <seednode> I have ~60TB of my own photography
[23:57:37] <seednode> Another 1TB or so of my voice work WAVs
[23:57:58] <aab_> I bet you don't need it all
[23:58:02] <aab_> 60TB wtf
[23:58:11] <aab_> incredible
[23:58:13] <sd> 05<r​mg22893> Microsoft must have heard whoever was complaining about Teams using Electron the other day, apparently they're dropping it
[23:58:33] <aab_> electron? what is electron
[23:59:14] <CptLuxx> lol..
[23:59:28] <seednode> aab_, "need" is a loose concept
[23:59:28] <aab_> what's funny about that
[23:59:39] <seednode> But a single photo from my main camera 2018-2021 is ~110MB
[23:59:43] <seednode> It adds up
[23:59:48] <seednode> As does video, when I shoot it, at around 400Mbps
[23:59:56] <aab_> Electron is an open-source framework, developed and maintained on GitHub.
[23:59:58] <aab_> I see
