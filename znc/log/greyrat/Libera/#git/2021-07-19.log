[01:23:09] <ep0k> hey guys -- im working on a git repo thru ssh on a box that only has a root user -- is there anyway i can make commits/pushes to the repo with my local credentials instead of trying to push as root?
[01:23:39] <BtbN> What do you mean, local credentials?
[01:23:51] <BtbN> Also, if you're root, what's stopping you from creating a user?
[01:25:29] <ep0k> its a host machine in a datacenter that i can't/am not allowed to create users on.
[01:25:45] <ep0k> and i mean like my repo credentials for github
[01:25:53] <ikke> ep0k: the user you authenticate with has little to do with the local system account
[01:26:20] <BtbN> I would not want to access a remote repo as root
[01:26:41] <BtbN> Giving you root access and letting you store a git repo, but not allowing you to create a user for that task?
[01:26:43] <ep0k> BtbN: I don't -- i want to use my personal credentials
[01:26:55] <BtbN> Well, then you will need to create a respective user.
[01:27:05] <ep0k> i can't create users on the host.
[01:27:10] <ikke> no need to
[01:27:23] <ep0k> is there a commandline option that i can pass my own credentials for authentication purposes
[01:27:26] <ep0k> and then commit/push as that user
[01:27:29] <ikke> github cannot see what your local user account is
[01:27:33] <BtbN> You seem to be confused about what credentials are
[01:27:50] <BtbN> The author of a commit has absolutely nothing to do with what ssh uses to authenticate to the remote host.
[01:28:06] <BtbN> Using root for that is a terrible idea
[01:28:14] <ep0k> BtbN: i dont want to use root for that
[01:28:23] <ep0k> how do i use another user -- without creating a user on the box
[01:28:31] <BtbN> Well, if you don't want to use root, and also don't want to create a user... you're kinda out of options.

[01:29:44] <BtbN> "im working on a git repo thru ssh"
[01:29:44] <dminuoso> Hi. I have a tool that does deployment based on some code from a local git repository. I want to provide a wrapper that uses `git` to check whether there's any upstream changes not fetched and merged, and error out if not.
[01:29:45] <ikke> from there, they want to push to github
[01:30:01] <dminuoso> Can someone give me some pointers what git plumbing commands I might want to look at?
[01:30:21] <ikke> rev-list --count
[01:30:29] <ikke> together with revision syntax

[01:31:07] *** Joins: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech)
[01:31:56] <BtbN> If you want to push to github on an untrusted server, I'd probably use ssh-agent-forwarding for that.
[01:32:12] <BtbN> Bit finnicky to setup, but least chance to have your credentials messed with
[01:32:23] <BtbN> or a repository specific ssh-deploy-key with write access
[01:32:31] <BtbN> And then put a password on the key
[01:32:40] <ikke> BtbN: agent forwarding to an untrusted server is higly insecure
[01:33:01] <ikke> they can use the socket to ask the agent to authenticate on their behalve
[01:33:05] <BtbN> Authenticating to your git repo from an untrusted server is
[01:33:26] <BtbN> So you need to either not do that, or cut your losses
[01:33:36] <BtbN> though I doesn't exactly sound like the server is untrusted?
[01:34:02] <ikke> They just want to know how to specify https credentials
[01:34:08] <ep0k> BtbN: so i log into a remote host (as root) over ssh. Then i cd to a git repo thats cloned on that host. I'm not allowed to create users other than root on that host. But i want to commit/push to a remote github repo from that host. But in my commits i dont want it to be from root
[01:34:33] <BtbN> You can configure user.name and user.email to be whatever
[01:34:35] <ikke> ep0k: git config user.name <yourname>
[01:34:46] <ikke> same with e-mail
[01:35:10] <BtbN> To push from a setup like that, to Github specifically, I'd use an ssh deploy key

[04:27:07] <average> guys, to me, lately Git seems it's a lot like Whatsapp. In both cases, for Git and Whatsapp fill a fundamental purpose, one is a version control system, the other is a messaging app
[04:27:41] <average> but in both cases I see new versions coming out all the time. Whatsapp definitely beats Git in terms of updates. If you let it, Whatsapp will update 3-4 times per day claiming critical fixes and patches of huge importance
[04:28:07] <average> Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, I do not fucking understand what Git still needs that there are new versions of it coming out

[04:33:31] <average> what have we done since then is my question, since those old git versions

[04:34:50] <average> nedbat: I know you have
[04:34:58] <tang^> kinda new to this whole software thing, ain't ya
[04:35:37] <average> tang^: for the past 17y i feel like i'm new to it every single day..
[04:36:02] <tang^> you're acting like you only got into using software today
[04:36:05] <average> tang^: the point is, I will always be new to Git if Git continues to change
[04:36:14] <tang^> everything changes
[04:36:20] <average> tang^: but should it?
[04:36:27] <average> tang^: and should it change at this rate?
[04:36:37] <tang^> yes and why not?
[04:36:49] <tang^> computers don't stop changing, why should software?

[04:36:50] <nedbat> tang^: average hasn't been able to say what the problem is.
[04:36:55] <circuitbone> Probably best not to entertain him whilst he is clearly not level at the moment. leave the rage in the cage when you chat on the screen page.
[04:36:56] <tang^> nedbat: I know
[04:37:34] <average> circuitbone: wdym, there is no rage
[04:37:42] <tang^> but you're right. I have time and could entertain them. I'll spare the rest of the channel, though
[04:37:56] <average> it's like.. if Git changes so often, why don't we patch /bin/cp and /bin/rm every single day
[04:38:08] <average> we should do that too.. and roll out new versions of coreutils like 4-5 per day
[04:38:10] <mackerman> Those are simpler and basically feature complete.
[04:38:16] *** Joins: __jmcantrell__ (~weechat@user/jmcantrell)

[04:40:20] <average> idk, I think I advocate a more Stalinist approach here, I think Git should be forked into Hit, and Hit should be bolted and tied down to a fixed agenda with a known end in sight. and if the people want, they can continue to change Git however they want. They can even put a copy of Emacs into Git.
[04:40:25] *** Joins: adlternative (~adl@117.32.216.79)
[04:40:55] <average> that's just my 2cent
[04:40:57] <nedbat> average: maybe instead of Hit you mean git 2.16.  just use that.
[04:41:14] <tang^> or use got
[04:41:35] <mackerman> Various "simpler" gits exist. For example,  https://gitless.com/
[04:41:54] <tang^> though, got is for BSDs, not Linux
[04:43:38] <average> maybe gitless is the solution, or got
[04:43:58] <average> I was asked in an interview "Do you know how to revert changes in Git?"
[04:44:02] <average> that could mean anything
[04:44:06] <mackerman> Git is less like  cp rm and patch, and more like  all of coreutils  plus other stuff.  Lots of tools to do arbitrary things with.
[04:44:17] <average> what does revert even mean anymore, when you have so many types of undos and reverts
[04:44:28] <average> this is my point ^^
[04:44:36] <average> Git is now trying to accomodate a million different people
[04:44:43] <average> everyone wants something, everyone has an idea
[04:45:15] <average> we're about to fall like the tower of Babel
[04:45:16] <mackerman> Millions, plural.  Although only a few get as far as hacking on it.
[04:45:38] <average> in an office setting you'll here people fighting about Git because one says something and the other one will never have the time to catch up on some command or some workflow
[04:45:43] <average> s/here/hear/
[04:46:52] <mackerman> Then the git familiar people on the team meet to establish conventions, and communicate them to the rest of the git users.
[04:47:06] <average> somehow I think this is being done on purpose and someone should really step up and shut down this silly social experiment
[04:47:23] <nedbat> average: i guess the interview didn't go well?
[04:47:42] <average> mackerman: or they don't, or they miscommunicate, or they constantly change those conventions, and fights break out
[04:48:04] <mackerman> Can't fix social problems with technology.
[04:48:34] <average> nedbat: overall I would say it was 60% okay, maybe 65%. but I am embarrassed like, I use Git every day, and I couldn't answer a Git question because the terminology and the concepts keep changing
[04:48:44] <average> nedbat: and why should I both keeping up..
[04:49:15] <average> like keeping up with what. it's just a vcs ffs.. what's the big philosophy here.. lol wtf
[04:49:33] <average> s/both/bother/
[04:50:24] <average> idk, I'm just disappointed and I think we're fucking around too much
[04:51:23] <mackerman> I don't use git enough to detail revert or edit scenarios.  I would need to reference the  !fixup  choose your own adventure
[04:51:23] <gitinfo> So you lost or broke something or need to otherwise find, fix, or delete commits? Look at https://sukima.github.io/GitFixUm/ for full instructions, or !fixup_hints for the tl;dr. Warning: changing old commits will require you to !rewrite published history!
[04:51:28] <average> mackerman: for sure they won't be fixed, but they can definitely be amplified
[04:53:51] <tang^> !revert
[04:53:51] <gitinfo> That's a rather ambiguous question... options: a) make a commit that "undoes" the effects of an earlier commit [man git-revert]; b) discard uncommitted changes in the working tree [git reset --hard]; c) undo committing [git reset --soft HEAD^]; d) restore staged versions of files [git checkout -p]; e) move the current branch to a different point(possibly losing commits)[git reset --hard $COMMIT]?
[04:54:10] <tang^> take that into your next interview
[04:54:31] <average> how about, you make Git such that my interviewers cannot ask me ambiguous fucking questions, thanks!
[04:54:41] <tang^> I'm not a git developer
[04:54:43] <average> so that we can have clear communication and not a million commands
[04:54:47] <tang^> they hang out in #git-devel
[04:54:54] <mackerman> A question with an unambigous answer is not interesting  :)
[04:55:16] <average> yes but i am too lazy to go to some other channel, i'm just here briefly to blow some steam and then i'll go do other things
[04:55:55] <tang^> blowing steam and other git users, doesn't help anybody but you
[04:56:04] <tang^> you don't have better avenues for calming down?
[04:56:54] <average> no trust me, it helps you. because right now you may feel like you're in control. let's see you when Git hits version 4.0 , you will have a long beard, probably bald or white hair.. and tired of novelties
[04:57:34] <average> (i'm not like that yet, but i will be in some years)

[04:58:14] <tang^> no. I won't
[04:58:24] <tang^> I already understand that software keeps improving
[04:58:34] <tang^> always
[04:59:29] <average> tang^: i'm sorry. mackerman actually hit the problem on its head. the majority of what git does, the fundamentals were already laid out way back.
[04:59:34] <average> what we're doing now is we're playing..
[04:59:49] <average> like kindergarten, we're like "hey let's jump over that guy"
[04:59:49] <tang^> that's what software developers do
[04:59:58] <average> and some of the kids succesfully jump, some fall on their face
[05:00:01] <average> and then they all laugh
[05:00:13] <average> and possibly one cries
[05:00:15] <tang^> nedbat: yeah, you're right. this has gotten boring
[05:00:23] <average> tang^: yes, Git is boring, thanks
[05:00:33] <average> or it should be boring but it's not
[05:00:41] <average> it tries to be exciting and ends up boring everyone
[05:01:45] *** __jmcantrell__ is now known as jmcantrell
[05:01:59] <average> okay fine, so tang^ also admitted this is what we do as software devs, and i should just accept it

[05:03:55] <mackerman> I don't care about the vast majority of git features.  Just me on a mostly linear history.  Works fine, the basics have been the same for years.
[05:06:36] <average> mackerman: I would like to have the luxury of not caring too. But these interviewers keep asking me about Git features and usage so they can judge and measure my competence
[05:07:02] <average> and I now wonder if I should take Git off my resume or to keep it there
[05:07:45] <average> because if I keep it on my resume, these interviewers can always cook up some fucked up Git scenario, or some benign-looking but tricky question to fuck me over in an interview setting
[05:08:43] <average> and it's very annoying, I then get to ask myself "Oh, but do I really know Git? hm, these interviewers asked me this and I didn't know how to answer it, do I know Git? Hm, but I've been using it for so much time. And I still don't know it? Should I just give up on it?"
[05:08:52] <adlternative> Hi,when I use GIT_CHERRY_PICK_HELP="213" git cherry-pick v1, I find I cannot cherry-pick --abort
[05:09:42] <adlternative> noooo.... I cannot do any cherry-pick options....
[05:10:33] <nedbat> adlternative: what is that environment variable for?
[05:10:37] <adlternative> it seem like when I use GIT_CHERRY_PICK_HELP, git will rm the CHERRY_PICK_HEAD
[05:10:55] <adlternative> see sequencer.c:412
[05:11:20] <tang^> see what?
[05:11:26] <nedbat> adlternative: i don't have the git source handy. do you know what it does?
[05:11:27] <adlternative> It's used for CHERRY_PICK adivce
[05:12:29] <tang^> how new is that? it's not documented where I can see it
[05:12:30] <adlternative> It's default adivce is:"after resolving the conflicts, mark the corrected paths with 'git add <paths>' or 'git rm <paths>'"

[15:28:33] <canton7> Swahili, !commit_hooks . See also core.hooksPath in man git-config, e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/a/37861972/1086121
[15:28:33] <gitinfo> Swahili: It would be a huge security risk if git allowed you to commit hooks. You have to manually add them to the server. Third-party Git hosting sites (github, bitbucket...) usually don't allow custom hooks, you can only have them send HTTP POST requests to a custom URL to get notified of events. For client-side hooks, we recommend including them in the repo along with a script users can run to set them up.
[15:28:34] <gitinfo> Swahili: the git-config manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-config.html
[15:29:13] <Swahili> gitinfo: thank you very much ;)
[15:29:13] <gitinfo> Swahili: you're welcome, but please note that I'm a bot. I'm not programmed to care.

[22:03:53] <anddam> using it always makes me itchy
[22:03:59] <bam32> trilobite: Meaning you want to patch your current version to look like the previous version? Or you want to reset your branch to the previous version?
[22:04:36] <trilobite> The first one. I want my repo to be exactly like the old version, but I want this operation to be a new commit
[22:04:43] <bam32> anddam: Windows ships with a where command. Or Git for Windows probably has a which.exe. Either should tell you which executable you're executing. If you're using a GUI it probably shipped with its own copy and is likely using that?
[22:06:09] <bam32> trilobite: (from the branch that you want to patch) git checkout $COMMIT_TO_RESTORE -- . (. being a path to the root of the working tree) && git commit -m "Reverted to $COMMIT_TO_RESTORE\nReasons..."
[22:06:41] <trilobite> Oh. It was that simple. Thanks you so much !
[22:07:09] <bam32> Note, it will overwrite any changes you have locally!
[22:07:41] <bam32> Make sure you commit or stash any changes you want to keep (or course, commit them after you restore the previous state or you'll lose them anyway).
[22:09:29] <bam32> anddam: I generally setup a MinGW and MSYS environment alongside Git for Windows and run everything from cmd.exe. I have had issues getting ssh-agent to play nice too though. I'm not certain I've even solved it.
[22:09:45] <trilobite> The first command put me in detached head mode, and I cannot seem to commit
[22:10:24] <trilobite> nvm i think its my fault
[22:10:50] <bam32> Hmm. Did you miss the -- argument? I'd say take a pause and make sure you understand what happened before going forward. :)
[22:10:55] <bam32> trilobite: ^

[22:14:11] <bam32> Be sure you ended up on the right branch. `git-checkout` does two things: it changes branches and it restores files. :) If you invoke the wrong one by mistake it can lead to confusion. There are now two separate commands that split the functions, but I'm oldschool.

[23:16:32] <imMute> haymawk: another thing that could have happened is you staged the files to be added (for the first time), and then didn't commit them.  then you deleted one of those files (so it's staged to be added, but in the work tree it's deleted again).  and then did git rm directory, which would delete the whole directory *and* stage the deletions, which would cancel out the initial additions resulting in a "nothing to

[23:17:30] <bam32> mekhami: If you want to rebase develop then you shouldn't `git rebase develop'. :) That would do nothing if you had develop checked out (and would rebase your current branch on develop otherwise).
[23:17:35] <imMute> mekhami: you can have regular feature branches and merge them into the main branch (without squashing or fast-forwarding), so you preserve the history of the feature branch.  but then if you do 'git log --first-parent ...' it'll only show the merge commits on the main branch, so you don't get cluttered by all the feature branch commits.

[23:29:57] <imMute> such is the nature of formattting changes.  they're painful, so it's best if you can avoid having to do them (or do them in pieces, so you can fix parts of the code nobody is working on at the moment)

[23:36:17] <mekhami> yeah we decided to rip the bandaid off and just do it all at once.
