[00:00:07] <sney> even just stick it in /etc/cron.daily
[00:00:08] <somiaj> SpeakerToMeat: yea, there are use cases for using the full list, the aptitude method I the best if you care about auto/manual installed, but with a docker image, and needing aptitude (which isn't installed by default), you can use dpkg directly
[00:00:17] <SpeakerToMeat> I'll crontab it to make one daily run. Either into /etc which I have on a volume, or some special directory and volume-it-up as well
[00:00:23] <SpeakerToMeat> sney, yeah
[00:00:37] <somiaj> dpkg --get-selections is a more core way to do that
[00:00:37] * dpkg selects somiaj's family photos collection
[00:01:02] <somiaj> since we didn't know your use case at the start, we just start out giving more generic answers.
[00:01:08] <SpeakerToMeat> I need to deploy this quick, and my friend is not being very communicative right now. So I'll do this. Otherwise I'd make a dockerfile for him with his package list install. It'd be the ideal but....
[00:01:21] <SpeakerToMeat> hmmm

[00:01:29] <somiaj> !debian clone
[00:01:29] <dpkg> One method of cloning Debian installs is to take a current Debian machine that is set up with the packages you want and run the command "dpkg --get-selections > ~/selectionfile".  Then, after the base install on other machines use that file and do: "dpkg --set-selections < ~/selectionfile && apt-get dselect-upgrade".  Also ask me about <aptitude clone>, <reinstall>, <things to backup> <apt-clone>.
[00:01:43] * SpeakerToMeat tries it on his machine
[00:01:44] <somiaj> there is a way to do this doing things with only dpkg

[00:02:09] *** Joins: xx (~xx@user/xx)
[00:02:17] <SpeakerToMeat> if I do this only with dpkg, will it have access to pulling stuff off repos?
[00:02:26] <SpeakerToMeat> I thought only apt/apt-get/aptitude did
[00:02:33] <somiaj> SpeakerToMeat: if you are seeing deinstalled in the dpkg --get-selections that means you have requested packages be uninstalled but they haven't yet
[00:02:55] <somiaj> yea, dpkg won't be able to get them from the net, but you can use it to get the current list, notice the bots command uses apt to actually do the installing

[00:03:21] *** Joins: xx (~xx@user/xx)
[00:03:51] <somiaj> the dpkg/apt method is a bit more core and won't require additional software, but it can use the auto/manual install flags which could cause your install files to bloat if you install/remove packages regurally
[00:04:05] <somiaj> arg, it will loose (not can use)

[00:04:27] <SpeakerToMeat> somiaj, could that be the result of a "package was automatically installed but not needed anymore" situation?
[00:04:43] <somiaj> that would make it so apt won't be able to figure that out
[00:05:30] *** Joins: lsrtl__ (~lsrtl@user/lsrtl)
[00:05:31] <somiaj> if all packages get toggled to manual install, then apt won't have any way to know if you have dependencies that aren't beign used anymore (though tools like deborphan can help clean things up if needed)
[00:06:14] <SpeakerToMeat> Nod
[00:06:30] <SpeakerToMeat> I'm just asking if that's where deinstall comes from. Stuff that would be deinstalled if I told apt to clean
[00:06:37] <somiaj> A lot depends on what you are doing with this docker image, as to if this will cause potitional issues down the road or not. I was just pointing out a bit more core alternative if auto flags are not something that matters in your situation.
[00:07:13] <somiaj> no, dpkg doesn't really know about the auto flag, I think these deinstalls you are seeing in dpkg --get-selections are something else
[00:07:30] <somiaj> try this, what does 'dpkg -l packagename' for one of these deinstall packages say, look at the first two letters, usually 'ii'

[00:09:23] <somiaj> okay, my guess was correct on that one
[00:09:32] <SpeakerToMeat> Ok, I get it
[00:09:44] <SpeakerToMeat> I'll check if any of those require me to keep the configs, and purge the rest

[06:43:28] <noord> I am trying to build debian package using debuild command with fakeroot, but it is not able to see the location of mvn command. Should I add it somewhere?
[06:44:23] <sney> packaging support is better in #packaging on OFTC (note, right now you are on libera)
[06:44:43] <sney> I'm not sure what you mean by 'mvn command' but you may need to put some overrides in d/rules if it's not behaving

[06:45:31] <noord> sney, mvn -> maven
[06:45:44] <sney> that's a build system, right?
[06:45:51] <noord> yes it is
[06:47:10] <sney> ok, same answer pretty much. if you haven't read the nmg, you may find useful information there in the override_dh_build section(s)
[06:47:31] <sney> but I would still recommend going to the aforementioned packaging channel, as #debian is mostly user support and not a lot of package maintainers idle here.

[18:22:39] <noa_> when i debian netinstall with no desktop selected, how can i install iw, wireless-tools, etc?  im left without a way to configure wifi as far as i can tell
[18:22:42] <mamajama> jelly, no, europe
[18:23:00] *** noa_ is now known as noa
[18:23:05] <jelly> huh
[18:23:27] <amacater_> noa - you might find it easier to use the non-free unofficial netinst including firmware.
[18:23:48] <jelly> dpkg, tell noa about firmware images
[18:23:49] <amacater_> If not, connect to a wired network and just apt install what you need
[18:24:08] <noa> amacater_: i can connect to wifi using the standard netinstall and my wifi card works fine with fully free drivers
[18:25:09] <noa> ive ordered an ethernet cable but its not arrived, figured there'd be some way to select exra packages in the install
[18:25:09] <amacater_> so - just install the packages you need. I tend to install network manager to get nmtui which then does all the other magic for me but you may choose to be more minimal.
[18:25:31] <mamajama> before trying to fix it with what i stated above it said something like "sum mismatch repository bullseye inrelease changed 'version' value from '11.01 to '11.1'"

[18:26:17] <amacater_> mamajama - was the machine originally running bullseye when testing and now bullseye has gone stable?
[18:26:29] <amacater_> If so apt-get update ; apt-get dist-upgrade might do it.
[18:26:37] <jelly> noa: hmm, it's unusual to have a non-functional network after it worked during netinst, but perhaps the iw tools only get installed if you select the laptop task?
[18:27:30] <jelly> (during the install process, at the task selection screen)
[18:27:39] <jelly> ,depends task-laptop
[18:27:40] <judd> Package task-laptop in bullseye/amd64 -- depends: tasksel (= 3.68), anacron.
[18:27:42] <noa> jelly: is the package list scrollable?  i havent seen/selected a laptop task.  thats kind of embarrassing if that's the case
[18:27:49] <jelly> noa: it is.
[18:27:55] <noa> oops
[18:28:00] <jelly> task* list
[18:28:15] <mamajama> amacater_, no I upgraded to bullseye from buster a few months ago and it was working fine
[18:28:24] <noa> thanks a lot everyone, sorry about that, ill try it now
[18:28:37] <jelly> ,recommends task-laptop
[18:28:39] <judd> Package task-laptop in bullseye/amd64 -- recommends: avahi-autoipd, bluetooth, powertop, iw, wireless-tools, wpasupplicant.
[18:28:42] <jelly> ah.
[18:29:19] <amacater_> noa - use tasksel to just install whatever task you need
[18:29:38] <jelly> still the installer _should_ be smart enough to install wpasupplicant, iw and wireless-tools if that was what provided internet access during installation
[18:29:54] <amacater_> Not necessarily ... :(
[18:30:34] <amacater_> It's one of the reasons why I always recommend installing using wired and  the firmware netinst if you have no other option
[18:30:36] <jelly> even the base install is supposed to get you a working internet and basically nothing but apt working
[18:31:11] <jelly> but the same thing would have happened even with firmware, judging by what noa's said
[18:31:14] <amacater_> jelly: True for wired - unless you've got some card that absolutely requires strange firmware
[18:31:26] <amacater_> but not necessarily for wifi

[18:31:56] * jelly mumbles something about the principle of least surprise
[18:32:11] <amacater_> Most of the realtek and broadcom ethernet chipsets will actually work - fractionally less well - without firmware for basic wired connectivity
[18:32:18] <noa> surely it'll always be the same thing providing wireless internet during installation?  selecting debian desktop and gnome configures network manager right

[18:49:15] <amacater_> It does if you put firmware in at the right point / use the firmware iso and that's your _only_ interface at least at installation. It might be that you could isntall everything you need via dropping to a shell right before exiting  the install.
