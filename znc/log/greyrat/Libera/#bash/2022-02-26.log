[01:18:21] <alesan> and YES, I am skipping the mathematical evaluation (the 017 -> 17 stuff) for now
[01:18:44] <alesan> yeah that's the variable I am trying to set on line 5
[01:18:46] <OnlineCop> monkeyPlus: `ls` returns an array of strings. When you use `ls *.txt`, all 10 files that contain newline characters, spaces, tabs, Unicode, and all sorts of other features are stored individually. You can assign the array that `ls` returns to you to some variable and/or loop over them. When you do that, be sure you're "double quoting" each individual string so those funky characters are preserved.
[01:18:57] <greycat> ls DOES NOT return an array

[01:27:43] <monkeyPlus> can i use the output of commands besides ls? is it recommended or not?
[01:28:01] <alesan> as it often happens, one discovers things while working on it. Up untl last week, I was just performing a simple string comparison and everything was fine. now it turns out I have to have knowledge of the various components of this version thing in order to do the right thing. It's possible next week will require different "things" - it's the reality of the facts. I am debated at this point,
[01:28:16] <phogg> monkeyPlus: if they output filenames you can only use it safely if the delimiter is NUL
[01:28:33] <alesan> monkeyPlus, has somebody told you to do somehitng like "for i in *; do echo "$i"; done
[01:28:44] <alesan> "
[01:28:59] <alesan> that is without using ls? that way it will be much faster
[01:29:05] <monkeyPlus> what if its not file names?? is that ok?
[01:29:26] <larryv> monkeyPlus: depends on the context and what the alternatives are.
[01:29:39] <monkeyPlus> ok..:)

[02:43:02] <lechner> Hi, does this look like it might work? http://paste.debian.net/1232278/
[02:43:12] <vancz> ok nevermind i figured _one_ thing out; my color scheme is bad and I misplaced an open brace
[02:43:45] <geirha> might as well use a case there
[02:45:04] <geirha> !assignment > lechner
[02:45:04] <greybot> lechner: To assign to a variable, use varname=value . Do not include spaces around the '=', and do not write $varname on the left hand side.
[02:45:04] <vancz> greycat: ok I think I see; just because I get a prompt back doesnt mean that stdout isnt still open
[02:45:35] <vancz> greycat: if I run the script, I get my prompt back - I had assumed this meant the process is "done"
[02:45:49] <vancz> then when I ran it in $(), it would return

[02:46:09] *** Joins: Marbug (~Marbug@94-226-144-213.access.telenet.be)
[02:46:32] <vancz> the difference is that the former still had stdout open somewhere but nothing was blocking on it, whereas for the $() case it keeps going till the script's stdout is closed?
[02:46:33] <geirha> and might as well just assign to the env var directly instead of the temporary storage through recipe
[02:46:36] <phogg> lechner: are you assuming args passed to e.g. the run function will ultimately be passed to perl? They won't be.
[02:46:39] <tirnanog> lechner: it will work in bash, specifically.
[02:46:56] <geirha> local -x RECIPE=$1 ; shift ; perl ... "$@" || exit
[02:47:00] <tirnanog> but yeah, that too.
[02:47:06] <lechner> bash is all i need
[02:47:25] <cptmorgan> tirnanog: retry won't work because its not an actual error. I need to retry and keep retrying if i see that specific error message. Im currently piping the output of the curl command. Could I somehow read the output of curl and loop the command if the output matches a string? A point in the right direction is all i need :)
[02:47:26] <tirnanog> either "$@" is spurious there, or you need for your wrapping functions to propagate "$@" too.
[02:47:40] <lechner> okay
[02:48:07] <tirnanog> cptmorgan: look at the section of the curl man page that explains the exit status values, of which there are many. identify the one that corresponds with the error message in question. check for it when curl exits.
[02:48:18] <tirnanog> ergo, by examining the value of $?

[02:48:58] <tirnanog> you can then implement your own retry logic no the basis of the relevant exit status value being encountered.
[02:48:58] <phogg> curl exit status is unfortunately not very helpful
[02:49:05] <tirnanog> why not?
[02:49:13] <tirnanog> it has a rich array of exit status codes.
[02:49:25] <phogg> it marks some conditions as error which you probably would not think of as errors

[04:30:22] <larryv> "Backslashes preceding characters without a special meaning are left unmodified."
[04:31:09] <alesan> larryv, yeah but he had an extra space at the end of the second string, so the two were not equal
[04:32:07] <alesan> how was to have a script checked by the bot?
[04:32:08] <larryv> i didn't notice that. even if the trailing space is removed, they aren't equal
[04:32:33] <pj> extglob is required for *() in 4.4
[04:32:33] <larryv> "\ " simply does not produce the same string as " "
[04:32:50] <pj> but not for [[ ... ]] matching, only for file globbing.
[04:33:13] <pj> so I wonder if extglobs inside pe's are an exception.

[04:36:03] <pj> *() requires extglob in file globs in 4.2 as well, so the docs are wrong in that regard.
[04:36:15] <monkeyPlus> like, inside a cycle, the words are separated by IFS, but outside the cycle, they are the same
[04:36:17] <monkeyPlus> right?
[04:36:44] <larryv> "the same" as what?
[04:36:50] <monkeyPlus> "\ " == " "

[19:18:55] <xmb> read(3) in the same man page ? i doubt so, right ?
[19:19:24] <chiselfuse> i don't understand your question..
[19:19:50] <chiselfuse> so you can do `man 1 read` or `man 3 read`, right?
[19:20:05] <xmb> you can search inside the current man page anything, but to open multiple pages u need to know your PAGERs usage like less or vim or so
[19:20:11] <chiselfuse> i want to do `man 1 read`, then while in it switch to 3
[19:20:21] <xmb> man only outputs the man page, to $PAGER or so
[19:20:38] <xmb> which is less in my case, but i dunno any less cmds, i bet is easy to open multiple man pages in buffer
[19:20:44] <tirnanog> yes, the pager would have to know how to do it. it's probably easier just to read them online.
[19:20:46] <xmb> or else maybe in vim editor buffer if u know how it works, i dont
[19:21:41] <tirnanog> ok
[19:21:46] <tirnanog> vim-manpager can do it, I think.
[19:21:50] <chiselfuse> it's just that i am used to doing shift+k (or uppercase "K") in vim to get a man page of a function, but when i do it for say, read(), it opens section 1 instead of 3
[19:21:56] <tirnanog> yes, see above.

[23:18:39] <Shortstop> I ask because I tried checking the 'ebook-convert' man page, and there's no recursive option so I will have to make a 'do' loop to get this done most likely to convert my books from .epub to .pdf

[23:32:04] <Shortstop> actually, lol, there's one weird thing
[23:32:16] <Shortstop> it doesn't strip the file extension at the end
[23:32:29] <Shortstop> for example: book.epub --> book.epub.pdf
[23:32:39] <Shortstop> thankfully I saw this with an echo though

[23:32:56] <coc0nut> okey, i have several aliases listed in a printf "alias n='nano'" is there problem with doing this ? there is several aliases in linebreaks with >> ~/.bashrc

[23:33:57] <phy1729> It sounds like you're making a script to automate munging a dotfile rather than making a dotfile repo

[23:42:45] <emanuele6> well, you don't need to quote "${a:-"${c:-"$b"}"}" multiple times, it is the same as "${a:-${c:-$b}}"
