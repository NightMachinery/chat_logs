[13:40:27] <lizmat> Welcome to Rakudo™ v2021.12.
[13:40:31] <lizmat> El_Che++
[13:45:16] <El_Che> lizmat: I should cloudsmith make to pay me. With every new release they add the needed distro because I ping them
[13:45:22] <El_Che> :)
[13:45:54] <El_Che> they lacked ubuntu jammy (next stable) so the upload of ubuntu-devel packages failed
[13:46:12] <lizmat> I see...  
[13:46:35] <El_Che> lizmat: I had to do a weird workaround, though:
[13:46:36] <El_Che> # Workaround for https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/1515
[13:46:36] <El_Che> mkdir -p $INSTALL_ROOT/share/perl6/site/short $INSTALL_ROOT/share/perl6/vendor/short
[13:46:39] <El_Che> touch $INSTALL_ROOT/share/perl6/site/short/.keep $INSTALL_ROOT/share/perl6/vendor/short/.keep
[13:46:55] <El_Che> the packager I use does not handle empty dirs well in debs
[13:47:23] <El_Che> and for one reason or the other rakudo started supplying 2 empty dirs a few releases ago
[13:48:07] <lizmat> have you made an issue for this particular issue ?
[13:48:46] <El_Che> yeah, it's in the paste
[13:50:04] <lizmat> the empty dirs issue ?
[13:50:54] <El_Che> yes
[13:51:47] <lizmat> nxadm commented 16 seconds ago
[13:51:50] <lizmat> yeah, now  :-)
[13:52:10] <El_Che> no, no, that's how I worked around it, not the issue itself

[19:09:16] <Altai-man> well, the original Camelia of course, but don't know about others. They look super cool though.
[19:09:50] <Altai-man> there are also those: https://github.com/Raku/marketing/tree/master/LOGOs/Camelia

[19:18:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @Altai-man Thanks for the links! I am writing about connecting Mathematica and Raku. For the Raku-mode cells in Mathematica I use the stylized icon https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uzluisf/metamorphosis/master/hex_camelia/perl6-color-logo1.png . (Rotated 30 degrees.) But I wanted to refer to more "generic" and well know source of Raku icons.
[19:20:16] <Altai-man> for the docs website I used this: http://raku-infra-fsn1-01.rakulang.site:10012/img/camelia-recoloured.png and IMO it looks 1)recognizable; 2)more stylish, the original is somewhere in the marketing repo.
[19:21:37] <Altai-man> I like the hex icon you're using now a lot too, IMO that's an example of an icon one can show to people outside of community without them making faces.
[19:22:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I tried to use a smaller version that icon to indicate Raku cells, but that icon has too many details.
[19:22:47] <Altai-man> hmm, how small do you need it to be?
[19:23:00] <Altai-man> in Comma we use 13x13, which is fairly small, and it works kinda alright.
[19:23:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @Altai-man Yes -- thank you for that feedback!
[19:24:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> There is a question of how well it fits with the icons of other language cells in Mathematica. I will post example within 2 min.

[19:34:31] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Here is an example of Raku and other languages cells in a Mathematica notebook: https://imgur.com/NvT40r0
[19:37:17] <Altai-man> hmm, I don't see anything criminal, but maybe it can be resized better, now it looks blurry.

[19:39:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Yeah, it does, I have to tweak the Mathematica code for those cells some more. I think the icons used by WRI are from vectorized drawings (not images.)
[19:39:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> WRI == Wolfram Research, Inc. (Makers of Mathematica)
[19:42:39] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> BTW, as background cell color I used background color in the input/output cells in the documentation. (E.g. here: https://docs.raku.org/language/objects .)

[19:47:39] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2b15eb819: OUTPUT: «Why does this match?»
[19:48:38] <Altai-man> lucs, because 'x' is Str and Str is Any.
[19:48:43] <Altai-man> maybe you meant this:
[19:48:59] <Altai-man> m: 'x' ~~ Any:U && print "Why does this wait you don't see me..."
[19:48:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2b15eb819: ( no output )
[19:49:04] <Altai-man> ?
[19:49:22] <lucs> Hmm... I'll think it over, thanks.
[19:49:24] <Altai-man> say: 'x'.^mro.say
[19:49:30] <Altai-man> oops

[19:49:45] <Altai-man> so it is an instance of Str, Cool, Any and Mu.
[19:50:43] <lucs> The context I'm seeing the "problem" is different, but your explanation should help me figure out what to do.
[19:51:12] <Altai-man> lucs, what do you want to do in the first place?
[19:51:28] <lucs> Let me beef up my example...
[19:51:28] <Altai-man> if you need an exact type check you can use =:= I think.
[19:51:40] <Altai-man> m: say Any =:= Any; say 'x' =:= Any;

[19:56:16] <lucs> Turns out I'm calling a function that returns an array, and I want to see if some element appears in that array.
[19:56:20] <lucs> But the returned array can look like (Any), and 'foo' ~~ @A matches in that case (which I don't want).
[19:56:30] <lucs> E
[19:56:32] <lucs> sorry
[19:56:48] <lucs> 'foo' ~~ any @A

[19:57:17] <lucs> (edited) But the returned array can look like (Any), and 'foo' ~~ any @A matches in that case (which I don't want).
[19:57:59] <lucs> At least now I understand what's going on :)
[19:58:29] <Altai-man> is the function yours?
[19:58:38] <lucs> No :(
[19:58:48] <Altai-man> if you can change it, why not return Empty... ah, I see

[19:59:14] <Altai-man> maybe you want `'foo' (elem) @what-returned`?
[19:59:25] <lucs> Oh, good idea.
[20:00:32] <lucs> Yeah, that works fine.
[20:00:35] <lucs> Thanks!
[20:00:35] <Altai-man> it's probably cheaper (?), but in any case it's less weird than using ~~ for membership check.
[20:00:46] <Altai-man> yw
[20:01:23] <lucs> "Weird" is in the eye of the more experienced developer ;)
[20:01:51] <Altai-man> perhaps
[20:02:22] <lucs> The TIMTOWTDI can sometimes be misleading, ey.
[20:02:31] <lucs> *eh
[20:02:33] <Altai-man> I mean, it's more specific and being more specific is good IMO.
[20:02:45] <lucs> Oh, I totally agree.
[20:02:51] <Altai-man> m: say 1 ~~ [1, 2, 3]
[20:02:51] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2b15eb819: OUTPUT: «False␤»
[20:03:02] <Altai-man> it doesn't work the usual way and then you need to do tricks with junctions
[20:03:07] <Altai-man> but junctions are tricky
[20:03:28] <lucs> I'd just forgotten about (elem) and tried something I vaguely thought would work.
[20:03:38] <Altai-man> yup
[20:04:19] <lucs> It's good to screw up like that once in a while (not too often!), it can become a learning experience.

[22:55:44] <spacekookie> It prints "(Any)" 
[23:00:11] <leah2> so, the problem is TOP doesnt match due to the whitespace
[23:00:12] <ugexe> because it should be e.g. `token TOP { <keyword> \s <payload> }`
[23:01:11] <leah2> and then you want LineGrammar.parse(...).made
