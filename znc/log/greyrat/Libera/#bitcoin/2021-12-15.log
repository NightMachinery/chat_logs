[01:22:12] <Victorsueca> Tuipveus: this transactions is already confirmed, you cannot add fees to it
[01:22:30] <Victorsueca> try closing electrum and opening it again

[01:28:37] <Victorsueca> The transaction is most definitely valid and confirmed, it must be a problem with your wallets failing to realize that
[01:28:41] <Tuipveus> I am asking...
[01:29:07] <edcba> maybe receiver is bullshitting
[01:29:22] <Tuipveus> I did set so small fee, so I tried to increase the fee to speed up, because it looked like that it will take about 12 hours to transfer
[01:29:39] <Tuipveus> then I increased the fee and it went through
[01:30:20] <Tuipveus> and confirmations received and I can see that on blockstream.info, but still with both clients, we can see that something strange going on

[01:33:08] <Tuipveus> I think it used to be 3

[21:33:10] <linux_dream> hello cryptocurrencers, i have a pytanie. err a question i mean, about ... fees to retrieve bitcoin from exchanges.  i realized that binance charges around 25 bucks to retrieve BTC out of it, while the real network fee of BTC is under 2 bucks.  does anyone know the fees of say, coinbase pro?  I couldn't find the info on the web

[21:33:35] <linux_dream> in the end i am thinking to use a hardware wallet to get the BTC out of the exchange(s)
[21:33:40] <buZz> linux_dream: https://withdrawalfees.com/coins/bitcoin
[21:33:45] <buZz> first random google hit
[21:33:51] <s1gyn> Have you guys tried knots?
[21:33:56] <buZz> linux_dream: you'd still need to do a -transaction- to get it out
[21:34:07] <buZz> s1gyn: i usually just use a comb to get them out
[21:34:14] <linux_dream> alright, there is no coinbase pro buZz but thanks for the link
[21:34:24] <buZz> linux_dream: i doubt its any different
[21:34:46] <linux_dream> buZz: sure, somewhere between 1 buck and 26
[21:34:51] <linux_dream> binance is more like 26
[21:34:57] <linux_dream> i want to know coinbase pro
[21:35:16] <buZz> dont they have a website?
[21:35:37] <linux_dream> they do but they lack the info
[21:35:46] <linux_dream> hence why i ask here
[21:35:51] <buZz> the downside of coinbase is the nationalistic setup leading to most ppl on earth getting near 0 experience on it
[21:36:03] <linux_dream> it's a rather popular exchange, so i thought that maybe some of you guys had experience with it
[21:36:42] <buZz> its not popular no

[21:37:18] <linux_dream> why is it so damn expensive though? this shit doesn't happen with monero, as far as I know, or any other currency
[21:37:33] <buZz> because exchanges are looking to get rich
[21:37:37] <zemzem> Its about the exchange not the blockchain
[21:37:42] <linux_dream> right
[21:37:47] <buZz> they do it on all coins, its often >10x the on-chain fees
[21:37:48] <zemzem> Those are exchange set withdrawl fees
[21:37:51] <linux_dream> why do they do this with BTC only
[21:37:56] <zemzem> Its not

[21:40:15] <zemzem> dude what are you talking about
[21:40:22] <linux_dream> all exchanges agree to overcharge for BTC withdrawla
[21:42:00] <linux_dream> zemzem: im saying that the withdrawal fee for BTC is about 25 bucks on most exchanges while the network fee is under 2 bucks. a gigantic step.   this shit doesn't happen with other cryptos.   8 usd for dogecoin in the most extreme case is not much.  algorand, they charge around 2 cents.  so.... yeah.
[21:42:49] <zemzem> You keep saying this doesnt happen for other cryptos but that is nonsense. It doesnt matter what youre withdrawling as long as you are withdawling form the exchange high fees will be involved
[21:43:31] <linux_dream> no. according to the link buZz provided, this is false. algorand's average is 15 cents (network fee is about 2 thousandths of 1 usd)
[21:43:53] <linux_dream> just look at all currencies. the higher fees comes from the network fees (based on ETH blockchain)
[21:44:01] <linux_dream> but BTC is the exception
[21:44:23] <linux_dream> 25 bucks for a cheap network fee.   i haven't found another coin like ethat in the list
[21:45:02] <buZz> yeah , btc networkfee is <1 usd

[21:45:06] <buZz> not 25 us
[21:45:10] <buZz> its not NETWORK fee
[21:45:15] <buZz> its EXCHANGE fee
[21:45:26] <buZz> they do NOT pay that on the chain
[21:45:32] <linux_dream> i know, that's what im saying
[21:45:45] <buZz> well, you called it network fee ;)
[21:46:02] <linux_dream> when you see 25 bucks usually in the list, it's because it's based on ETH blockchain, and this really reflects the network fee
[21:46:14] <buZz> algorand 0.15  where actual fee is 0.002 usd
[21:46:15] <linux_dream> so when you withdraw, you pay 25 bucks, not 50
[21:46:24] <buZz> thats 7500% higher
[21:46:25] <linux_dream> yes buZz , exactly what i wrote aove
[21:46:31] <buZz> btc 25 usd where network is 0.5
[21:46:41] <buZz> thats just 5000% higher
[21:46:50] <buZz> see, algrand is more expensive
[21:47:03] <linux_dream> whatever in %, the fee is extremely small.  this is not a good way to compare. for example a free to use (nano) would give you an infinite %
[21:47:21] <linux_dream> this is bs to compare with %.   raw numbers on the other hand, means everything
[21:47:22] <buZz> percentages arent a good way to compare values? :D lol
[21:47:29] <buZz> what economy education did you get :D
[21:47:40] <linux_dream> ok man, whatever floats your boat
[21:47:46] *** Joins: pyrorock (~Dont@46.136.13.72)
[21:47:48] <buZz> math does
[21:47:53] <linux_dream> infinite percentage is fine to you even though you pay 1 cent
[21:47:59] <linux_dream> alrightly. i get your logic
[21:48:09] <linux_dream> im done
[21:48:09] <buZz> thank god
