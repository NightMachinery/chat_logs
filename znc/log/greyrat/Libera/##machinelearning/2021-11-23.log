[13:54:15] <Guest5> hey all o/
[13:59:03] <Guest5> I'm trying to build a forecasting application with python. I'm using univariate time series algorithm there. But It's now working as expected. I created a data pattern just to see if it's gonna predict the next element. My pattern consists of 23 numbers. all different. I copyed and pasted the same number sequence like 150k times and led the
[13:59:04] <Guest5> algorithm learn for like 20 minutes. The result is not correct! Do you guys have any idea why the machine learning model cannot see the pattern? Any little help will be so helpful. I'm new to this field. thank you!
[13:59:47] <Guest5> I meant "But it's NOT working as expected"

[14:22:52] <savolla> here is a precise example to explain what I do here; first I have this pattern like [1,6,32,8]. now I add the same pattern again and again like [1,6,32,8,1,6,32,8,1,6,32,?]. I added the question mark at the end. this is what the AI should find. it's 8 as you can see. now I added the same pattern consecutively for 150.000 and led the ai learn this
[14:22:52] <savolla> pattern but it is still predicting the wrong number. Maybe there is another algorithm or solution? Or the machine learning approach is not suitable for this kind of problem?
