[05:04:02] <ephemer0l> what was this channel formed from?
[05:04:19] <ephemer0l> I'm offended SeaDough is not here

[05:33:38] <Hydragyrum> joanna started this channel largely because #security was off the rails (full of trolls, toxicity, etc.)
[05:46:47] <jan6> for anyone who 1) uses windows instead of a sane OS, 2) has admin access and 3) wants to bulk-set DNS for all connected network adapters, I made a script for you, lol, https://ttm.sh/eMO.ps1
[05:47:26] <jan6> extremely few people would both be interested in, and want to use this script, but it could come in handy
[05:48:44] <jan6> I can see it handy for, for example, allowing DHCP, but forcing your own network, with a bit of modification, you could probably change the server based on what wifi you're connected to, for example (at which point it starts being a bit useful)
[05:48:52] <jan6> s/network/dns
[05:49:23] <jan6> obviously most people here use more sane OSs, but still ;P
