[03:05:33] <trbp> i guess socrates, allegory of the cave?
[03:06:17] <Samian> trbp  what do you mean?
[03:06:38] <trbp> look it up wikipedia
[03:07:00] <Samian> The allegory of the cave expresses the same idea s saying "the universe a virtual reality system we're plugged into."
[03:07:22] <Samian> trbp they didn't have computer back then, so probably that's the best anology Socrates could come up with to express his ideas
[03:07:26] <trbp> well hm not that way
[03:07:35] <trbp> but the guy sent out and back
[03:07:47] <trbp> that is more like your question, why show not tell
[03:07:48] <Samian> sent out and back? What do you mean?
[03:08:25] <trbp> is there not someone who goes out the cave and comes back and nobody belives what is told?
[03:08:56] <trbp> hence "you have to see it yourself"

[19:17:27] <arryana> i will pass those on.  all good vibes are appreciated here.
[19:17:33] <arryana> and to be honest, it's been fun
[19:17:45] <arryana> everyone's treating it like a gigantic slumber party
[19:18:16] <arryana> someone even brought their goddess
[19:18:28] <arryana> which is always bonus
[19:18:29] <pussipupu> I don't know what you mean by "soul" scivias, but as it's generally used it's not a hypothesis I accept so I can't speak to that
[19:18:51] <pussipupu> cat, dog, human or trashpanda goddess?
[19:18:58] <arryana> cat
[19:19:07] <pussipupu> yay!
[19:19:08] <arryana> there's two greyhounds which live here, as well
[19:19:22] <arryana> one on my right and one on my left, at the moment
[19:19:49] <pussipupu> Hmm sorry I missed your definition, I don't believe that such an entity exists or is necessarily meaningful
[19:20:11] <pussipupu> So I reject the premise of the question and can't answer it

[19:22:06] <pussipupu> No
[19:22:38] <arryana> ooh, i hear people waking up.

[19:24:39] <arryana> i think i have enough time for a tea and a smoke, the shower's runnin
[19:24:40] <arryana> g
[19:25:05] <pussipupu> don't drink tea or smoke in the shower
[19:25:14] <pussipupu> you risk dilution and extinguishing

[19:34:48] <pussipupu> Ah, do you see me?
[19:34:53] <brigand> pussipupu: yes
[19:34:59] <pussipupu> might be an issue with the Matrix bridge
[19:35:04] <brigand> and arryana too. but she has me on ignore xD
[19:35:07] <brigand> oh
[19:35:28] <brigand> confusing xD
[19:37:15] <pussipupu> I'd guess scivias isn't identified to nickserv on Libera and is thus muted on the IRC side of the bridge

[19:41:03] <blkshp> I bought some CBD oil to see what all the fuss is about.
[19:41:36] <brigand> stupid architecure. scivias[m], if you want more people to talk with you, register at libera :)
[19:41:39] <luminousnine> Well i hope it has THC at least, because in here you can't get any of that
[19:41:41] <pussipupu> CBD oil should have no psychoactive effect
[19:41:52] <blkshp> No it has no THC
[19:41:59] <luminousnine> I see
[19:42:05] <blkshp> But it was reduced to 7 quid from 30 so thought, why not.

[19:47:39] <pussipupu> You need to tell me that, why do you believe it?
[19:50:51] <pussipupu> I see no need to hypothesise a separate organiser

[19:58:39] <arryana> haha
[19:58:53] <Ungwelian> soul (n.1)
[19:58:53] <Ungwelian> "A substantial entity believed to be that in each person which lives, feels, thinks and wills" [Century Dictionary], Old English sawol "spiritual and emotional part of a person, animate existence; life, living being," from Proto-Germanic *saiwalō
[19:59:09] <pussipupu> Large parts of the papacy were pretty fond of it
[19:59:22] <blkshp> quite true
[20:00:44] <Ungwelian> So basically, soul = mind = brain.

[20:01:43] <Kurupt> generally the soul has been thought of as immaterial
[20:01:49] <Kurupt> so not the brain
[20:02:00] <Ungwelian> I think a lot of people still behave so, even though they think the opposite.
[20:02:29] <pussipupu> It's a massively contested term
[20:02:56] <pussipupu> Which is why I attempt to come to terms
[20:03:32] <Ungwelian> I mean, so many people don't take care of themselves, because they feel that the self is essentially safe.

[20:11:14] <pussipupu> I wouldn't agree that a ship is a different one after one repair, or in general that things have to be made of the same matter to maintain identity
[20:11:41] <pussipupu> but this sort of identity is more about our view of things than a feature of base reality anyway
[20:12:00] <pussipupu> And this still doesn't support your view of the soul that I see
[20:12:58] <pussipupu> You get increasing edge cases though, such as which, if either, or both, daughter cells are the mother cell after mitosis
[20:13:50] <pussipupu> lots of differences, yes
[20:14:18] <pussipupu> Why do you believe in a separable atomic "soul"?

[20:18:06] <pussipupu> I'd say neither a Theseus nor a ship needs to always be composed of the same matter to have continuity
[20:18:32] <blkshp> But if you replace the cover and all the pages is it the same thesaurus?
[20:18:40] <blkshp> the thesaurus of thesius.
[20:18:59] <pussipupu> The most  verbose of the dinosaurs
[20:19:07] <blkshp> lmao :D
