[13:44:49] <IceMichael> hi guys
[13:45:36] <IceMichael> wondering... If I want to use a range of self-hosted runners (e.g. in AWS) for some action pipeline (like github actions) and need to compile via visual studio or something there, how do I get them there? By default, they are missing... also tons of other tools that I'd actually need
[13:45:50] <IceMichael> would you just create an image of something working and use it on demand all the time then?
[13:45:57] <IceMichael> but not sure if this works with vs activation

[15:21:31] <rawtaz> IceMichael: im not sure i understand the question. are you talking about containers or vms or what? when/why would amazon supply you with visual studio in those?
[15:22:11] <IceMichael> rawtaz: I need a platform for a github action self-hosted runner, which could be an AWS EC2 instance, e.g.

[15:22:45] <rawtaz> yeah. unless AWS supplies images which has the tools you need in them, you presumably have to supply that yourself
[15:23:05] <IceMichael> yes, asking myself how to best automatize that
[15:23:16] <IceMichael> because VS usually needs a user to log in once to work
[15:23:32] <IceMichael> so no fun... but maybe an image and creating instances based on this already solves it
[15:23:52] <rawtaz> depends on how youre deploying the runner i guess. but like, regardless of VM or container, i guess you simply upload an image for it, contianing your tools
[15:24:22] <rawtaz> yeah. you'd upload it to AWS so it's available when creating containers or ec2 instances
[15:28:58] <rawtaz> do you know about packer?

[17:21:16] <rawtaz> fancy that: https://everythingshouldbevirtual.com/automation/generatingexecuting-terraform-plans-using-ansible/
[17:21:30] <rawtaz> im curious how people do use ansible and tf together, or vice versa.
[17:23:27] <rawtaz> obviously one can "call" ansible from terraform (which i think most people do), or call terraform from ansible (like in the article above), or a compromise where you do it like in the article above but then in your terraform stuff also have tf call ansible for the final configuration of the inventory, if that makes any sense.

[21:40:01] <rawtaz> ok :)
[21:40:25] <rawtaz> interesting, i didnt know you'd produce AMIs with ansible. i imagine youd do that with packer
