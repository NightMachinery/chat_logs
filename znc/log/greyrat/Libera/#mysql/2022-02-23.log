[00:13:16] <steve> So I'm certain that I'm overthinking this... but I think I could use some help
[00:13:39] <steve> I have a transactions table (transaction_id,customer_id,transaction_date,cost). Some of rows will show the cost column as 0. The rest will be positive decimal values.
[00:13:48] <steve> Using a single query, I'm trying to select customer_id, number of non-zero transactions, and number of zero-cost transactions from the table over a certain date range, grouped by customer_id
[00:14:09] <steve> Right now I've got something like: SELECT customer_id, ??? as nonzero_transactions, ??? as zerocost_transactions FROM transactions WHERE transaction_date BETWEEN '2022-02-01 00:00:00' AND NOW() GROUP BY customer_id
[00:14:27] <steve> I have no idea what the ??? fields should be...
[00:14:59] <steve> If I were just selecting zero-cost transactions, I'd add 'AND cost = 0' and then do a COUNT() on all the rows
[00:15:24] <steve> Is there a way I can do like, "group by cost=0 and cost!=0" ?
[00:17:28] <steve> I suppose I could just do it in two queries, but I kind of feel like I need to learn the right way of doing it in a single query
[00:19:56] <lopid> you can shove a CASE in your SELECT
[00:20:01] <lopid> two, rather
[00:22:02] <steve> wow, I had no idea that CASE even existed
[00:22:22] <steve> That's fantastic!
[00:22:53] <lopid> you could probably achieve the same with IF(), too, but not as nice to format
[00:26:46] <steve> lopid: that was exactly what I needed
[00:26:48] <steve> Thank you!!

[02:57:11] <skyfall> Are multivalued attributes always kept in a separate table? Like, if a hobbies for example, and since it's a multivalued attribute in `Users` table, we have a separate table called `Hobbies` that contains `User_id` and `Hobbie_name` in which we store multivalued hobbies belonging to users in `Users` table. (Like here:
[02:57:11] <skyfall> https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/cecs/dbdesign/dbdesign.php?page=hobbies.php) So, when drawing a URL ER diagram for example, when we have a multivalued attribute for an entity/table, it implicitly implies that we store that multivalued attribute in a separate table, right?

[07:28:24] <meder> https://dpaste.com/8W9PGWZ6E how can it work with an inner join the same way with my correlated subquery? don't I need a parent reference to parent_id?
[07:28:47] <meder> the WHERE in my inner join is clearly not it; just trying to use the base you supplied
[07:29:15] <thumbs> meder: the ON clause can use more than one column
[07:29:40] <thumbs> and remove WHERE pages.id = children.parent_id from the subquery.
[07:30:41] <thumbs> meder: the trick is to join the derived table against the pages table again
[07:31:56] <thumbs> meder: the question is now: now many levels is that tree?
[07:32:05] <meder> 2 max
[07:32:14] <meder> limited by UI
[07:33:16] <meder> I removed the WHERE from the INNER JOIN of course, but if I add it to the join conditions, I need to select the parent, but in selecting the parent additionally, i get the group by notice that expression #2 isn't in the list
[07:33:24] <thumbs> so extract pages.parent_id in the subquery, and join the pages table again based on the proper id value
[07:34:13] <thumbs> SELECT ... FROM tbl JOIN (SELECT col1, MIN(col2) AS col2 FROM tbl GROUP BY col1) AS tbl2 ON tbl.col1 = tbl2.col1 AND tbl.col2 = tbl2.col2

[08:02:39] <meder> firstly it returns two parent results where it should be one, but I think the MIN() within is messed up due to a major misunderstanding
[08:02:42] <thumbs> meder: so, what are you trying to update to what now?
[08:03:45] <thumbs> selecting ofc.id, ofc.parent_id
[08:03:56] <meder> in essence, i'm trying to get all root containers, and update the 'default_container_id' to the first created 'child' of type 'container'
[08:03:57] <thumbs> are you sure that is what you want to do?
[08:04:08] <meder> I believe I need to remove ofc.id
[08:04:31] <meder> ok
[08:04:59] <thumbs> so step one - extract only the root containers, no derived table.
[08:05:48] <meder> which if I remove the whole inner join, I get
[08:05:55] <meder> (and the child_join.* select)
[08:06:19] <thumbs> show us only the query that extracts the root containers, and nothing else.
[08:07:42] <meder> https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_5.7&fiddle=62b30eb2fa1662e0e1a691a3300ccbf1
[08:09:11] <thumbs> ok, good. Now let's get the child containers. The first one.
[08:09:21] <thumbs> add another box to the fiddle
[08:10:23] <meder> https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_5.7&fiddle=aa9d45d14c23a17cb7f56bd7e5d04c08
[08:10:32] <meder> does that work?
[08:10:52] <meder> first select grabs the root containers; second is a specific query using the hardcoded parent_id
[08:11:17] <thumbs> we need to do better, get the first child for all parent_id values.
[08:11:19] <meder> just don't know how to transform that into an inner join that uses MIN(created) or ORDER BY created ASC
[08:11:34] <thumbs> don't join yet until you can visualise the data
[08:13:18] <thumbs> meder: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_5.7&fiddle=cc8fb8670511fa38f334dbe02330b53e

[08:14:09] <thumbs> https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_5.7&fiddle=188185b29fd5f4ee7f7153209aa29cc3 rather. But your test data is poor, you should have more containers.
[08:15:02] <meder> https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_5.7&fiddle=d5fb2bde018a084c607b294cbc593c20
[08:15:04] <meder> there's more data
[08:15:10] <meder> added a parent with no children, and another parent
[08:15:32] <thumbs> you didn't use my last second query.
[08:15:49] <meder> yeah, I didn't see, updated using it sec
[08:15:51] <meder> https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_5.7&fiddle=0a3f082e41735d911c0690d28280eb9e
[08:16:08] <thumbs> stop using LIMIT.
[08:16:18] <meder> can I rely on MIN(id) if 'id' is not auto increment?
[08:16:48] <meder> but I guess that's the next step in the conversion, yeah..
[08:17:05] <thumbs> meder: created would work too.
[08:17:25] *** Quits: lsrtl__ (~lsrtl@user/lsrtl) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[08:17:25] <thumbs> meder: now, pay close attention to id from the first set, and parent_id from the second
[08:17:58] <thumbs> meder: wrap the first query in a derived table, and LEFT JOIN the second using another derived table.
[08:18:29] <thumbs> meder: SELECT .... FROM (SELECT ....) AS a LEFT JOIN (SELECT .... ) AS b ON a.id = b.parent_id
[08:20:19] <thumbs> meder: you can even skip the first derived table altogether - SELECT .... FROM test_pages LEFT JOIN (SELECT ...) AS b ON .... WHERE test_pages.default_container_id IS NULL AND test_pages.type = 'root_container';
[08:20:38] <thumbs> meder: you should stop using " for quoting literals, too. Make a habit of using ' instead
[08:23:03] <meder> I'll probably check tomorrow, just too late in the day and that's why I'm asking
[08:23:05] <meder> thank you
[08:23:19] <thumbs> meder: you are this close to the solution. Write my last comment.
[08:24:30] <thumbs> then the UPDATE form is UPDATE test_pages JOIN () AS a ON ...  SET test_pages.col = a.col WHERE ...
[08:32:18] <meder> but in that version you have, don't I need 3 selects and we initially start out with 2? confused on what ON should be now, https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=mysql_5.7&fiddle=de9412faffc41df7a29ddb206b0ad717
