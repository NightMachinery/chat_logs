[02:03:02] <buZz> >0
[02:03:12] <TsundereNoises> like does it make everything look like shit, or is it just a thing people who care a LOT get extremely mad about
[02:03:25] <TsundereNoises> in the way of the internet about technology since forever
[02:03:28] <buZz> TsundereNoises: if you want correct colors and brightness on -any- screen , i recommend getting a spyder for it
[02:03:44] <buZz> works on IPS , oled , whatever , anything screeny
[02:03:56] <TsundereNoises> DO I wan't correct colors? I'm not actually sure, I'm asking how uncorrect they are
[02:04:01] <buZz> i dont know :D 
[02:04:11] <buZz> -all- black on TFT has a light behind it
[02:04:15] <buZz> so its never really black
[02:04:24] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: black looks pretty black to me
[02:04:29] <buZz> its just light -> LCD blocking all light -> eyes
[02:04:35] <TsundereNoises> for context, I've been using an old crt monitor, the flatscreen I had before that was some shitty thing and 10 years old at the time
[02:04:36] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: I'm using IPS
[02:04:50] <buZz> its never reaaaaally black , try a black.png fullscreen on a monitor , vs monitor -OFF-
[02:05:04] <buZz> the black.png will be a lot greyer than then black while being off
[02:05:14] <TsundereNoises> so it's like, is the "blacks don't look right" thing some terrible all movies look like shit issue, or like people who download the highest quality videos and have STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT MONITORS ARE VERY ANGRY kind of thing
[02:05:27] <buZz> TsundereNoises: oh totally the latter
[02:05:37] <buZz> audiophile levels of care
[02:05:38] <buZz> :D
[02:06:05] <TsundereNoises> buZz: yeah like the stuff you were saying, I don't think that matters, I don't have an ideological purity issue here, and I'm not a graphic designer or anything
[02:06:25] <TsundereNoises> but I don't want my japanese children's cartoons to look like complete shit
[02:06:35] <buZz> TsundereNoises: i just borrow a spyder4 every time i change a lot about screens
[02:06:38] <TsundereNoises> if I'm biting the bullet and buying a monitor ANYWAY
[02:06:43] <buZz> highly recommend doing it
[02:07:07] <buZz> its just amazing how i can have 4 completely different screens on my workstation , yet have close to perfect colors between them
[02:07:20] <buZz> even with one of em being a 'hdready tv' from yesteryear
[02:07:49] <buZz> takes about 20-30 minutes to calibrate a single screen
[02:07:58] <TsundereNoises> not sure who I'd borrow one from anyway

[02:11:59] <buZz> TsundereNoises: i saw 'abuse of war on drugs' as a method of transport too :D
[02:12:04] <TsundereNoises> I have an ancestor who came over on the mayflower...
[02:12:18] <buZz> some taxidriver from .nl gave his business card to a guy
[02:12:30] <buZz> who then got arrested in NY with 5? pills of XTC
[02:12:40] <buZz> popo found the card and were like 'YES WE GOT HIM'
[02:12:47] <TsundereNoises> I don't even understand why that's a crime
[02:12:50] <buZz> so they had the taxi driver extradited to US
[02:12:51] <TsundereNoises> well I do
[02:12:56] <TsundereNoises> prisons are profitable
[02:13:14] <buZz> so he could stand in court and say 'i am a taxi driver, the card is about my taxi business, i do not sell XTC'
[02:13:21] <buZz> and then got flown back again
[02:13:26] <buZz> was sooo WTF
[02:13:47] <TsundereNoises> he could have ditched the 2nd flight, easier than trying to sneak in other ways
[02:13:54] <buZz> hehe
[02:14:03] <buZz> well, assumably he was in custody the whole time
[02:14:53] <buZz> hmmm all this drug talk is making me hungry

[05:16:40] <emmeka> that depends on your tastes. most of them are acquired tastes.

[05:16:43] <emmeka> lol.
[05:16:43] <buZz> taste is pretty personal
[05:16:48] <ButterNoodle> cause u can mix it with anything

[05:17:32] <ButterNoodle> just watch ur input.. its ez to over serve urself on vodka and have to hug the toilet
[05:17:52] <emmeka> Satin you can make sweet cocktails with vodka, but beware of the combination of sweet+alcohol
[05:17:54] <buZz> cranberry juice + vodka is kinda popular
[05:17:55] <emmeka> you will rot your gut
[05:18:00] <buZz> also redbull + vodka
[05:18:02] <Satin> O_O
[05:18:06] <ButterNoodle> OJ and vodka
[05:18:13] <emmeka> screwdriver is classic
[05:18:17] <buZz> cola + vodka not so much
[05:18:17] <ButterNoodle> vodka in virtually any drink
[05:18:35] <ButterNoodle> cola deserves shitty whiskey
[05:18:37] <emmeka> Satin I'm just gonna say go simple and get a good rum and drink rum and coke
[05:18:44] <emmeka> that's a drink for people who don't like alcohol
[05:18:45] <ButterNoodle> ahh yes
[05:18:47] <ButterNoodle> rum
[05:18:53] <buZz> or rosé
[05:18:54] <ButterNoodle> rum and coke
[05:18:58] <ButterNoodle> rum and ginger ale
[05:19:05] <buZz> especially rosé lambrusco 
[05:19:13] <buZz> thats like drinking 7up of 13% alcohol
[05:19:24] <emmeka> well Satin said she hadn't drank anything ever until 1 month ago, I'm not sure we'll make a wino out of her yet
[05:19:32] <buZz> :P
[05:19:36] <emmeka> and I can't recommend any wines she can probably get
[05:19:54] <ButterNoodle> I like brandy infused wine
[05:19:58] <buZz> i come from a long lineage of alcohol addicts
[05:20:01] <Satin> Wine sounds fancy
[05:20:08] <ButterNoodle> thats good.. but expensive to chug
[05:20:09] <emmeka> ButterNoodle did I ever tell you my wife's uncle owns a vodka distillery that won second place at some big international spirits competition
[05:20:15] <ButterNoodle> nice!!!
[05:20:20] <Satin> wow
[05:20:38] <buZz> nice :)
[05:20:44] <Urchin[emacs]> !later tell tsunderenoises https://i.redd.it/g4qkep6qq6381.jpg
[05:20:45] <ButterNoodle> skyy vodka is pretty decent

[05:21:18] <buZz> hi
[05:21:19] <emmeka> but you can never find any Canadian shit in yankeeland
[05:21:25] <ButterNoodle> woah 45 for a 1/5th
[05:21:35] <emmeka> that's CAD, but yeah.
[05:21:45] <ButterNoodle> gettin into bourbon prices
[05:22:29] <ButterNoodle> most expensive bourbon bottle I've had was some weller special reserve.. that was $110 for a 1/5th
[05:22:30] <amigojapan> Buzz before Corona I used to go a lot to the Tokyo hackerspace
[05:23:27] <emmeka> Satin wine is something with a lot of variation and you need to learn what you like in wine and the only way to do this is try many of them. Dry or sweet, red or white (or pink), grape variety, region.
[05:24:10] <emmeka> wines differ vary significant depending on where they came from and the grape variety
[05:24:17] <Satin> fascinating
[05:24:34] <buZz> amigojapan: nice! 
[05:24:39] <buZz> > Eidolon Port Ellen 1983 36 y.o. 53,5% sherry butt 1983
[05:24:45] <buZz> damn, 3600 euro per bottle
[05:24:49] <buZz> 0.7L bottle
[05:25:06] <emmeka> and your tastes will depend on what regions you're exposed to
[05:25:19] <buZz> yes, thats why we lick all things
[05:25:29] <buZz> taste the rainbow \o
[05:25:35] <buZz> :) jk
[05:25:46] <Satin> emmeka: sounds very cultural lol
[05:25:50] <amigojapan> I only like manishewitz wine
[05:26:05] <emmeka> well, it is, as you can see from amigo's comment
[05:26:05] <buZz> i like the effect of alcohol more than the flavour
[05:26:31] <buZz> hmmm i got 1 glass of whisky left
[05:26:33] <buZz> *pours*
[05:26:35] <emmeka> I grew up in a winery region and if I'm honest I find I like best wines that I drank the most of back home, and so, that's what I buy
[05:27:03] <emmeka> not that they're objectively better, but they're to my taste because they shaped my taste
[05:28:47] <emmeka> my favourite wine is just the Baco noir I can get by the case for reasonably cheap from Sandbanks Estates near where I grew up
[05:28:51] <amigojapan> emmeka: you may be right. Or it may be cause manishewitz tastes like pure sugar
[05:29:10] <buZz> :)
[05:29:25] <emmeka> manishewitz is just Welch's grape juice
[05:29:27] <emmeka> literally
[05:29:31] <emmeka> it's a concord grape wine
[05:29:38] <amigojapan> Yeah
[05:29:57] <emmeka> but, the only winery in the United States to have survived prohibition
[05:30:29] <emmeka> a tragedy really. there were whole wine regions based on muscadines in the southern states that have only begun to rebuild
[05:30:35] <amigojapan> emmeka: were they exempt for religious reasons?
[05:30:39] <emmeka> yeah.
[05:30:59] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[05:32:24] <emmeka> amigojapan of course, the winery's owners were more than happy to exploit this exemption and sell ass tonnes of wine to goyim anyway
[05:32:46] <emmeka> god bless Jewish business sense
[05:33:03] <amigojapan> emmeka: I bet non Jews drank it too

[05:45:16] <MootPoot> well, as long as there is a 1 inch thick layer of ice
[05:45:20] <MootPoot> it should be fine, no?

[09:24:34] <Cryowolf> He's really good at making his content interesting and appealing
[09:24:47] <amigojapan> Yep Cryowolf .I recently wrote a comment to the podcast
[09:24:56] <Cryowolf> he can make a trip to a random Onsen be fun to watch
[09:25:29] <Cryowolf> I suggested to him (as half a joke) that this year he upgrade his Cycling Across Japan and do a "Walking Across Japan"
[09:25:38] <Cryowolf> allowing him to get to more rural areas
[09:25:54] <amigojapan> Lol Cryowolf 
[09:26:15] <Cryowolf> It would also be fun to see him suffer like he did in Cycling across Japan
[09:26:25] <Cryowolf> it makes for great entertainment
[09:26:47] <Cryowolf> well when he suffers for comedy that is. Not if he would genuinely suffer
[09:26:51] <Cryowolf> like....serious
[09:26:54] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I explained why Japanese have the word "kamikaze", cause they were wondering that the other day, and I know why
[09:27:39] <Cryowolf> Well all I know is that with the planes during WW2 it was cause they were out of fuel after the long trip
[09:27:42] <Cryowolf> and couldnt fly back
[09:27:49] <Cryowolf> and wouldnt be captured
[09:28:07] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: but that is not the origin of the word
[09:28:18] <Cryowolf> no it isn't but it must play a part in it
[09:28:22] <Cryowolf> I mean why they used it
[09:28:51] <Cryowolf> does it have something to do with god or gods?
[09:29:02] <Cryowolf> wind carry me to the gods!
[09:29:04] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: the origin is that the Mongols, twice, attempted to invade Japan by boat
[09:29:39] <Cryowolf> they mostly failed due to the weather conditions or something?
[09:29:56] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: but both times the ships were sunk by a typhoon. So they called it kamikaze, or divine wind
[09:30:24] <Cryowolf> yeah I knew kami was in there and wind but didnt know the connection
[09:30:30] <Cryowolf> I thought it was gods wind or something
[09:30:35] <Cryowolf> but divine wind
[09:30:36] <Cryowolf> thank you
[09:30:42] <amigojapan> No problem
[09:30:50] <Cryowolf> I was close though
[09:30:56] <amigojapan> Yup

[09:36:08] <Cryowolf> heh. I didnt mean just America
[09:36:23] <Cryowolf> a lot of countries were involved in the development of the atomic bomb
[09:36:29] <Cryowolf> a lot of "allies"

[09:36:48] <Cryowolf> but back then during WW2, Japan had a very different mindset from now
[09:37:20] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I just talked to some 87yo grandma's on the street the other day about the war tho. They did not seen angry. But they told me about the hardships
[09:37:40] <Cryowolf> During or after?
[09:37:46] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: during
[09:38:04] <amigojapan> They were elementry school students during the war
[09:38:06] <Cryowolf> Yeah, war usually does that
[09:38:42] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: they said, on the way back from school. Planes would shoot at them
[09:39:13] <Cryowolf> who's planes?
[09:39:24] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: America
[09:40:24] <Cryowolf> why would they target elementary school students? When flying so far from their carriers and on a mission, it seems wasteful. Or was this after Hiroshima and Nagasaki when Japan had surrendered?
[09:40:30] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: some of their classmates were killed by the planes

[09:40:52] <amigojapan> I don't know
[09:41:02] <Cryowolf> Or were they collateral by being too close to other bases?
[09:41:25] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: they also survived the great Tokyo carpet bombing
[09:41:44] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I guess collateral
[09:41:50] <Cryowolf> yeah I'm not looking at this from a perspective to defend America. They commit a lot of war crimes, past and present. I'm looking at it from a realist and pragmatist perspective
[09:42:19] <Cryowolf> like why waste ammunition and fuel to shoot at kids going home from school? it accomplishes nothing
[09:42:33] <Cryowolf> Stray bullets from shooting at something else I can believe
[09:42:45] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: maybe they could not tell they were kids
[09:42:53] <amigojapan> From above
[09:43:39] <Cryowolf> maybe, but they usually have designated targets and the co-pilow and navigator would use a camera or "periscope" a lot of them had underneath the plane
[09:43:41] <Cryowolf> to confirm targets
[09:44:14] <Cryowolf> unless the school was near a military insallation, there was no reason and if they still did it, then they commited a war crime
[09:45:13] *** Joins: gitargy (~gitargy@76.78.94.79)
[09:45:29] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: yeah. I would need to ask them again about the military base
[09:45:31] <Cryowolf> the shooting of children as well as civilians and the act of terror and murder etc that holds. Whoever was in that plane, should have been arrested and imprisoned
[09:45:45] <Cryowolf> if it was collateral, that's a very sad thing
[09:45:58] <Cryowolf> but it happens everywhere if you look at it realistically
[09:46:13] <Cryowolf> especially in the past when the weapons weren't very accurate
[09:46:26] <Cryowolf> and bullets could stray hunders of meters in the wrong direction

[16:33:33] <riv> wut

[16:41:03] <Sadale> isekaijin, that's for tomorrow. Not today :P
[16:42:09] <isekaijin> Sadale: But NNN is over.
[16:42:32] <Sadale> isekaijin, too crowded. Can't use sex toy without getting discovered by my parents for normal days
[16:42:38] <isekaijin> I see.
[16:44:50] <isekaijin> So, after two years of living with my parents, I finally have 1-2 weeks alone, and now I am pondering whether I should go back to my home.
[16:45:48] <isekaijin> Pros: Can bring call girls. Cons: I would have to use my shitty laptop instead of my desktop computers. (Because there is no way I am moving my desktop computers back home, only to move them back here.)
[16:48:34] <isekaijin> Why does it have to be such a hassle to move computers?
[16:48:51] <buZz> call girls are the ones that are 24/7 toktikking?
[16:49:18] <buZz> or literal phone operators?
[16:49:23] <isekaijin> haha
[16:51:05] <isekaijin> I guess they are phone operators, in the sense that they use a phone to arrange services that will be delivered later.

[17:00:39] <Sadale> isekaijin, you could either get a gaming laptop or convert your computer into a superlaptop like mine: https://secret.sadale.net/imeig/superlaptop.png
[17:00:40] <ImoutoBot> [image/png] 960kB
[17:03:04] <Sadale> Won't work if you've got a 3.5" HDD, multiple HDDs/SSDs or dedicated graphic card tho. My case isn't compatible with any of them.
[17:03:32] <Sadale> And the size limit can only accomodate some of the smaller mATX mobos, not full size mATX mobo
[17:04:56] <isekaijin> How much money did you invest in your laptop?
[17:05:57] <Sadale> Cheaper than a laptop of equivalent performance. I reused the SSD. After that, this laptop costed me like, maybe like $400.
[17:06:20] <Sadale> And I also get a used CPU. That's a used 2400G.
[17:06:32] <Sadale> It's like 30% cheaper than the new one.
[17:07:02] <Sadale> here's a better looking pic of my laptop: https://secret.sadale.net/imeig/superlaptop2.jpg
[17:07:04] <ImoutoBot> [image/jpeg] 2.2MB
[17:07:45] <isekaijin> Mmm.
[17:08:15] <Sadale> Oh there's a few catches. First, it requires laser cutting machine (or manual hole drilling) to assemble the laptop. 3D printer is also required for some of the parts. Second, it has no battery. Third, it's more bulky than normal laptop. But it's still kind of portable as you could fit the whole thing into a bag.
[17:08:33] <Sadale> The advantages are that it's cheaper than a laptop. And it's quite upgradable. :3
[17:08:48] <isekaijin> Yeah, looks as easily upgradeable as a desktop PC.
[17:08:56] <isekaijin> Which is in itself a huge advantage over normal laptops.

[17:09:14] <Sadale> yep. As long as you aren't going over its limit (i.e. multiple harddrives, 3.5" HDD, dedicated graphic card, oversized mobo)
[17:09:18] <isekaijin> Also, you can much better keyboard than a normal laptop's as well.
[17:09:30] <Sadale> oh and the PSU is the server 1U one. Not the normal ATX PSU.
[17:09:38] <Sadale> true.
[17:12:22] <isekaijin> Thanks for the info. Might spend these two weeks trying to build this laptop instead.

[17:14:29] <Sadale> isekaijin, Do let me know if you need the design. It's designed for 3mm acrylic boards. And the monitor is a 15.6" one with Vesa mount. The two hinges there is just powerful enough to hold the monitor (originally the case was meant for one hinge only. It turned out that one wasn't enough so I had too add a new hinge)

[17:16:27] <Sadale> It's "I'm a Behemoth, an S-Ranked Monster, but Mistaken for a Cat, I Live as an Elf Girl's Pet".
[17:16:36] <Sadale> a bit NSFW!

[18:08:01] <amigojapan> darkwitch: don't you have an equivalent of a 100 yen shop?
[18:08:36] <darkwitch> where everything has to cost exactly that price? I don't think so
[18:08:50] <amigojapan> I see
[18:08:58] <Urchin[emacs]> !later tell tsunderenoises https://i.redd.it/ihhn6hghta381.jpg
[18:09:11] <darkwitch> there are shops with cheap things, but not a fixed price I think
[18:11:27] <amigojapan> darkwitch: 100yen shops recently have some premium things that cost more than 100yen. Like the 10000mah phone battery which costs 1000yen
[18:11:37] <emmeka> darkwitch where are you that dollar stores don't exist
[18:11:43] <darkwitch> they mostly sell what I can order from china anyway. the only convenience is getting it the same day
[18:11:58] <emmeka> though dollar stores are infamous for most things in them now costing $2 or $3
[18:12:08] <darkwitch> a place that uses euros emmeka
[18:12:18] <darkwitch> no one cares about dollars
[18:12:32] <emmeka> there's no 1€ shops though

[18:12:47] <darkwitch> there could be

[19:45:25] <rohitmalik776> Oh
[19:45:31] <emmeka> most clients by default will ping for your nick. but that can be turned off.
[19:45:36] <rohitmalik776> So there's no special interface for that, just the name?

[19:46:05] <rohitmalik776> That's nice, thank you 
[19:48:16] <emmeka> rohitmalik776 there's no need for a special interface because all the client is doing is notifying you if it sees your nick among the text posted, even if it's mixed with other letters
[19:48:53] <emmeka> there's nothing server side doing it
[19:49:17] <rohitmalik776> Oh, I just noticed that your message turned green when you tagged me, I thought it was because you were admin or something

[22:42:55] <ButterNoodle> u think journals are a fix for shit media?
[22:43:06] <MootPoot> no
[22:43:07] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: yeah, I know Pekora is for all ages, I'm just pondering how much of a gateway drug she is to Marine or Haachama
[22:43:08] <MootPoot> but its a bandaid
[22:43:14] <MootPoot> better then not having one
[22:43:14] <ButterNoodle> not really
[22:43:23] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: lol
[22:43:29] <DPA> My micro sd cards tend to fail all at once. Will either just stop reacting, or rill become readonly.
[22:43:37] <ButterNoodle> its not like you have parity blocks..
[22:44:00] <MootPoot> from my experience and talking to others - they're not much better but the NTFS ones or ext4 ones I have tend to fuck up less
[22:44:09] * TsundereNoises is having fun
[22:44:26] <ButterNoodle> DPA: the 100s of flash media I've had fail have mostly failed a few blocks at a time
[22:44:38] <Jigsy> I've decided on my New Years Resolution.
[22:44:38] <ButterNoodle> maybe 2 have out right died
[22:44:44] <Jigsy> I'm going to work on become insane.

[22:45:00] <Jigsy> I want to be one of those people who just stands in the lounge at three in the morning in pitch darkness for no reason.
[22:45:23] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: buy better carts
[22:45:40] <ButterNoodle> and reduce writes
[22:45:45] <DPA> I had usb drives and nvme drives too, but I never had those fail.
[22:45:45] <DPA> Speaking of file systems, there is also f2fs specifically for flash media.
[22:46:08] <ButterNoodle> flash media != nand
[22:46:15] <Bco1981> don't have swap/pagefile/partition on a microsd card.
[22:46:32] <MootPoot> in the spirit of reduing writes I am now installing ubuntu on a microsd
