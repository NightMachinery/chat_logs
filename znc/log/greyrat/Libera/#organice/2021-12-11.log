[17:11:36] <Guest87> Hi everyone. I am exploring organice in an iphone (first time I use an iphone) and I am wondering how I can open a local .org file in organice. i don't want to use syncro via cloud tools. i am using just synchting to sync with my computer org files. Any ideas of how to explore local folders and open .org files in the web app?
[17:12:20] <Guest87> cannot find the option, so I guess I am missing something
