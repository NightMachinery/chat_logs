[10:00:48] <tsujp> where is it documented that ~ is an alias for the users home directory and . an alias for the current working directory, in POSIX?
[10:01:48] <geirha> https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_01
[10:03:00] <geirha> and . is not an expansion, like ~, it's simply a directory entry. A directory is created with the two entries . and .. already included
[10:03:13] <geirha> s/,//1
[10:03:21] <tsujp> Ah yes right `ls -la` shows both . and ..
[10:03:37] <tsujp> Where can I find the definition of .and ..? I don't know how to google it because . isn't a very unique expression haha

[14:39:35] <flower_> should be human-editable
[14:39:43] <phogg> djph: yeah, it has blocks of memory and a type is just how you read it this time

[14:40:29] <pj> double colon is okay if you'e sure that your name field won't have that (the URL field can url-encode colons so it's not an issue there)
[14:41:10] <djph> meh, use all the ASCII Control characters at the first 1F bytes.  Those are never used.  And if you do it right, you can make your program go 'PING'
[14:41:11] <phogg> flower_: semicolon is not legal in a URI, but anything could be in description. As long as you URI-encode the URI field, forbid it in app names, and put description last you can probably use it.

[14:41:21] <pj> or you could use a space as delimiter and encode all the data in, eg, URL encoding, but that makes it more difficult to directly edit.

[14:44:52] <phogg> tab is at least unlikely to be wanted inside of the app name

[14:57:38] <pj> honestly, I tend to like JSON.  You can have one JSON array per record, so it looks like: ["name","URL","Description"] there are JSON encoders and parsers for pretty much every language, you don't have to worry about special characters as the encoders will escape them for you (except for manual editing) and the format is clear and relatively easy to edit by hand.
[14:58:29] <pj> the hardest thing is with bash but you can use jq to parse it with bash.
[14:58:46] <djph> flower_: that "rule" is basically telling you to be careful when utilizing tabs, as "tab" and "space" is typically indistinguisable for a user (unless they :set list in vim for example)

[21:36:45] <eoc> sh doesnt have somethig for =(echo command) ?
[21:37:09] <Soliton> what is =(echo command)?
[21:37:23] <koala_man> no, you'd have to manually create and delete a temp file
[21:37:30] <eoc> okok

[21:38:16] <phy1729> Sometimes a heredoc is sufficient
[21:38:22] <jirido> but that gives me no option to filter a file or a long multi row output.. or does it? I think like this: cat long_file my_serarch_expression | slurp    slurp() {grep "$1"| xclip -in selection clipboard; (here i want a comand that paste to the readline what i just piped in to xclip, without using any interaction) }
[21:38:52] <Soliton> i cannot decipher that.
[21:39:04] <Soliton> now you always want to grep for something?
[21:39:27] <Soliton> why not: grep my_serarch_expression long_file?
[21:39:36] <Soliton> and then press the binding.

[21:41:58] <Soliton> what?
[21:42:13] <Soliton> that is why you had the pipeline to begin with, no?

[21:44:53] *** Joins: iomari891 (~iomari891@105.112.138.38)
[21:48:03] <jirido> so I just put the binding in my bashrc to get it permanent? and will this then buffer every output on the command?

[21:53:17] <Soliton> no... only the binding does that.
[21:54:23] <jirido> so do I use it before i run the command?
[21:54:24] <Soliton> READLINE_LINE=$(eval "$READLINE_LINE")  means assign to READLINE_LINE the output of  eval "$READLINE_LINE". so execute the current command and replace it with its output.
