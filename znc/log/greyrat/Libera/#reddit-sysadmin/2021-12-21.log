[00:48:12] <Santax> NorCal just had a 6.2 quake off the coast.
[00:48:15] <Santax> shake rattle and roll!
[00:49:15] <haise01> holy shit
[00:49:19] <haise01> I wouldn't want to be in their pants
[00:49:55] <Santax> happened like 20 something miles out to sea and the article said its a transform fault so they're side to side not up and down so no real risk of a tsunami
[00:49:59] <haise01> I had 6.1-6.2 quake and I live on 4th floor in apartment, fucking closet almost sandwiched me while I was sleeping
[00:50:08] <Santax> heh no good
[00:50:52] <vinrock> i kinda want to be in an earthquake
[00:51:10] <Santax> vinrock: same. i want to feel it
[00:51:15] <vinrock> yeah
[00:51:26] <vinrock> i saw a tornado once so i got that off the list
[00:51:29] <Santax> gotta be an eery feeling that the ground decides to start moving
[00:51:30] <vinrock> now i need to feel the earth shake
[00:51:42] <haise01> vinrock: if you are in house you are probably gonna be fine, its fucked when you live on high floors of apartment complexes 
[00:51:45] <haise01> then shit gets fucking scary
[00:51:56] <vinrock> id want to run outside and lay down on the grass while it goes nuts
[00:52:10] <vinrock> hopefully not get swallowed by a creavss
[00:52:29] <Activ8> places get bad conditions year in year out.  Why does the government allow people to live in tornado valley (for example)
[00:52:48] <Activ8> the houses ain't built for tornados they ripped out of the ground in the middle of a one
[00:53:03] <vinrock> all the new stuff now has to be built to code
[00:53:08] <Activ8> gov should have a duty of care 
[00:53:23] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Lol wot
[00:54:48] <Santax> Activ8: they do
[00:54:51] <Santax> for taxes. 
[00:54:55] <Santax> and compliance 
[00:55:40] <Activ8> I think I worded that a little bit wrongly
[00:56:06] <Activ8> the gov knows what areas get natural disasters, like the zones where problems happen year in year out.
[00:59:08] <Santax> Activ8: i get it. Same with Tornado alley but where do you draw the line. LA in cali is due for another big one. there's people that live around volcanoes. Hawaii and the PNW. 
[01:00:09] <Activ8> I'm not sure anywhere that would survive a big tornado/hurricane but it's risky having anyone anywhere close to natural disaster zones
[01:00:13] <SantaGibby> DID SOMEONE SAY 'NADER?!
[01:00:40] <Santax> SantaGibby is happier than a tornado in a trailer park

[06:15:49] <catbeard> he means like sending as sub.domain.tld instead of domain.tld
[06:15:50] <csws> apparently 10 is the limit
[06:16:02] <greentree> if your subdomain does spf lookups that still counts towards the limit pretty sure
[06:16:03] <csws> https://www.mailhardener.com/blog/spf-lookup-limit-explained
[06:16:08] <csws> seems like a good article
[06:16:27] <greentree> 10 seems to be the limit, but i checked my company on mxtoolbox today and we've been >10
[06:16:31] <greentree> and email seems to be... working
[06:16:39] <greentree> so i'm not sure who exactly is enforcing this limit
[06:16:48] <catbeard> the RFC

[06:17:42] <Cl0udSanta> note the 'include:spf*.sampledomain.com'
[06:17:58] <Cl0udSanta> theres probably better examples but that was the first I found
[06:18:23] <greentree> this article refers to the 255 character limit for the spf record
[06:18:32] <greentree> you can't just move dns lookups to subdomains and circumvent the 10 limit lol

[06:27:03] <greentree> this is from a source that i think would be more reliable than me or you
[06:27:10] <greentree> "If you are close to reaching your limit of 10 DNS Lookups and someone in your "include" adds additional DNS record to their own SPF record, you could easily go over your limit of 10."
[06:27:18] <greentree> a subdomain is no different than "their own record"
[06:27:34] <greentree> you simply CANNOT circumvent dns lookups with moving the include: directive elsewhere
[06:27:47] <greentree> if you can show me an example where you've achieved this with a domain, that'd be great
[06:28:01] *** Joins: noahajac (~noahajac@user/noahajac)
[06:28:17] <greentree> you can definitely achieve what you're suggesting if you stop using dns lookups and circumvent the 255 character limit with multiple subdomains

[06:33:29] <greentree> i'd love for Cl0udSanta to be right actually, would make life easier
[06:33:40] <greentree> but i already know that is simply not true. our spf record only has 8 dns lookups in the "actual record"
[06:33:53] <catbeard> if you already know then why did you ask us
[06:33:57] <greentree> we've go over 10 because there are dns lookups in the third parties we reference which brings us over the 10 limit
[06:34:04] <greentree> i didn't ask
[06:34:10] <greentree> i asked if having more than 10 is bad
[06:34:15] <Cl0udSanta> I dont have any examples, as I havent worked in hosting in almost 8 years

[06:34:18] <catbeard> greentree | how bad is >10 dns lookups in an SPF record
[06:34:19] <csws> it'll break your shit
[06:34:20] <greentree> then i was given a made up solution
[06:34:27] <greentree> to my problem statement
[06:34:31] <Cl0udSanta> you dont add a bunch of DNS lookups, you add the IPs via ipv*: entries
[06:34:39] <csws> ip4
[06:34:40] <Cl0udSanta> and then you can have up to 10 spf* domains as includes:
[06:34:47] <greentree> yes, that will work
[06:34:49] <catbeard> and stay away from ptr and mx directives
[06:34:51] <Cl0udSanta> oh right fuckin spf gotta be special
[06:35:07] <Cl0udSanta> ip4 != ipv4
[06:35:08] <greentree> thats going off a crude assumption that those ip ranges will never change
[06:35:09] <catbeard> but also yeah, spread out your sending via subdomains as opposed to your root domain
[06:35:24] <Cl0udSanta> greentree, where I was, they never did, or rarely did
[06:35:26] <greentree> i already acknowledged all of this
[06:35:31] <catbeard> so e.g. sub.domain.tld has it's own spf chain
[06:35:41] <greentree> i understand that you can circumvent the 255 character limit with subdomains
[06:35:53] <catbeard> you can also circumvent the 255 limit with " "
[06:36:01] <catbeard> at least for those long DKIM records on Route53
[06:36:03] <greentree> but you certainly CANNOT spread dns lookups across many subdomains and get away with it
[06:36:59] <catbeard> you don't have to spread it to subdomain, just adjust the domain you're sending from to be a subdomain when needed so it's not neccessary to break the SPF limit of the root domain's SPF policy
[06:37:09] <Cl0udSanta> right, yeah you cant do a bunch of includes in included domains and shit like that, but its not hard to circumvent the limitations otherwise, and you dont NEED to do the DNS ones, because generally you make your mailservers static IP and they rarely change
[06:37:20] <greentree> that also catbeard, i had acknowledged "offloading sending email to a subdomain"
[06:37:21] <catbeard> e.g. instead of sending from you@rootdomain.tld
[06:37:29] <catbeard> send from you@corp.rootdomain.tld
[06:37:47] <catbeard> and fix up corp in TXT
[06:38:10] <catbeard> with authorized senders as a separate policy
[06:38:13] <greentree> has anyone ever tried out universal SPF before?
[06:38:27] <greentree> they seem to claim they have some automagic shit to adjust spf on your behalf

[06:39:25] <Cl0udSanta> stupid easy
[06:40:06] <catbeard> they manage the include basically?
[06:40:14] <Cl0udSanta> that'd be my guess

[11:42:39] <lancehead> how're you
[11:42:58] <SirSantalot> I have a slight itch in my throat
[11:43:01] <SirSantalot> it was nice knowing you all
[11:43:06] <Hunterkll> "Loath as I am to alarm-a-dilly you, I must confess-doodley-ess my concern ovefr Doctor Shantotto's recent ding-dang-doodley behavior"
[11:43:38] <lancehead> lol sirsantalot 
[11:43:40] <lancehead> RIP
[11:44:31] <lancehead> So, my workplace is aware I'm an insomniac. Yesterday my manager suggested I start getting up earlier so I feel more tired at night 
[11:44:33] <Cl0udSanta> Hunterkll, for some reason that reminded me of the safety officer at the forklift job I had when I was 18. everyone called him flanders behind his back
[11:44:44] <lancehead> I've tried it a million times before but figured "fuck it, it might just work while I'm working"
[11:45:03] <lancehead> So I went to bed at 01:30 and woke up at 06:30
[11:45:03] <Cl0udSanta> lancehead, are your hours hard set?
[11:45:09] <lancehead> I am SO GODDAMN TIRED 
[11:45:16] <lancehead> @SirSantalot ^ 
[11:45:25] <lancehead> @Cl0udSanta you mean my work hours? 
[11:45:27] <Cl0udSanta> yeah
[11:45:48] <lancehead> Nah, as long as you come in between 8 and 9:30 and work 8.5hrs
[11:45:51] <Cl0udSanta> my boss was super understanding when I told him that I'm a nightowl and allowed me to shift my hours to work better for me. as long as I make it to standup I'm good
[11:46:02] <SirSantalot> take a nap at work. "your idea backfired boss"
[11:46:10] <A-KO> howdy
[11:46:22] <SirSantalot> please note: don't actually follow my advice
[11:46:28] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> lollll
[11:46:35] <lancehead> lol I already asked him to support me a lil today. He's normally all over the place, but I told him I could use a little backup @SirSantalot
[11:46:41] <A-KO> wtf you doing up Hunterkll?
[11:46:41] <A-KO> lol
[11:46:48] <Hunterkll> you say that
[11:46:50] <Hunterkll> like every day
[11:46:53] <Cl0udSanta> I had a job that was basically 100% cruise control and for 6 months I slept all day and then was awake all night making money on side jobs
[11:47:14] <Hunterkll> also modding the shit out of a PS2-era graphics engine to not make it look like pixelated garbage
[11:47:15] <Cl0udSanta> I set an alarm to wake myself up every 30 minutes, check the helpdesk, go back to sleep, wake up at 6, clockout for the day
[11:47:15] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:47:40] <lancehead> I do a lot of internal support @Cl0udSanta and me and my manager are the only two sys/networkadmins in the building 
[11:47:45] <SirSantalot> waking up every 30 minutes sounds like torture
[11:47:51] <lancehead> Company of like 80 ppl 
[11:47:55] <lancehead> So we have to be here as much as possible 
[11:48:04] <Cl0udSanta> SirSantalot, wasnt bad, I was able to fall asleep again in like 2-3 minutes
[11:48:17] <Cl0udSanta> lancehead, ask him if you can come in a few hours later, and stay a bit later
[11:48:29] <lancehead> I prefer the other way around honestly 
[11:48:29] <SirSantalot> Cl0udSanta, you're a sysadmin, couldn't you find a better way to automate that? Just set an alarm when a ticket comes in.
[11:48:31] <Cl0udSanta> you'll get some layering in coverage and there will always be a late and early person
[11:48:41] <Cl0udSanta> SirSantalot, at the time, I couldnt
[11:49:02] <lancehead> I live with my girlfriend, if I stay late she's not gonna be happy @Cl0udSanta (and neither am I), so I'd rather come in early and go home early to chill 
[11:49:16] <Cl0udSanta> well whatever, ask him about it
[11:49:22] <Cl0udSanta> but give good reasons for why :)
[11:49:31] <Cl0udSanta> like, you work better, and the coverage thing I mentioned
[11:49:35] <lancehead> Yee. He suggested the above so it'll be okay 
[11:49:40] <SirSantalot> Cl0udSanta, buy a sloth, train him to gently nibble on your ear when a ticket comes in
[11:49:57] <Cl0udSanta> why? I could just pay you to do it instead ;) lol
[11:50:16] <SirSantalot> I'm not sure how to feel about that offer
[11:50:20] <lancehead> Cl0udSanta: What I'd normally do is sleep 4 hours, go to work, nap for another 3 so I get 7 overall but that still leaves me tired 
[11:50:21] <Cl0udSanta> lol
[11:50:36] <Cl0udSanta> lancehead, thats kinda my current situation. I do alright
[11:50:46] <lancehead> I was doing alright as well, but could be better 
[11:50:48] <lancehead>  
[11:50:48] <Cl0udSanta> but I also worked graveyard and swing for like 6 years
[11:51:16] <lancehead> I'm also dissociated/depersonalized which layers on top of me being tired lol 
[11:51:33] <lancehead> So I gotta start sleeping better again if I wanna keep this up 
[11:53:03] <lancehead> Luckily there's not as many people in since we went back into lockdown, and next week we're migrating to a new system for registering our work hours so there's gonna be no one but me and my manager 
[11:53:04] <Cl0udSanta> I both love and hate sleep
[11:53:19] <lancehead> Same. I love sleeping but I hate how hard it is 
[11:53:32] <Cl0udSanta> I love sleeping, but I hate how time consuming it is lol
[11:53:44] <lancehead> lol
[11:53:53] <lancehead> That's some sigma grindset mentality if I've ever seen it 
[11:54:08] <lancehead> "I hate sleep, it keeps me from my work!" xD 
[11:54:11] <Cl0udSanta> lol
[11:55:43] <Cl0udSanta> its just that theres only 24 hours in a day, and theres a minimum required number of those hours that have to be dedicated specifically to survival; eat, sleep, wash, shit, shave, adult, etc. and then you add a daily work schedule to that, and you're only left with a few hours a day to really do anything
[11:55:59] <Cl0udSanta> sleep takes up ~1/3 of your life. THATS A LOT OF FUCKING TIME
[11:56:09] <lancehead> Ooo boy he read my messages asking for a little extra assistance today and I can *hear* his gears grinding over the internet on what to respond 
[11:56:28] <lancehead> True that @Cl0udSanta, since I work 8.5hrs a day I only end up with like 4 left to myself 
[11:56:40] <lancehead> Well no like 5/6 
[11:57:34] <Cl0udSanta> yep. the worst has been when I was having to drive 50mi one way every day for work, and all of it was traffic. some days I'd spend 3 hours one way in traffic, and by the time I got home I'd have like 3 hours max for myself to make my survival
[11:59:57] <lancehead> jeez
[12:00:13] <Hunterkll> mmmm
[12:00:22] <lancehead> I travel 20 miles one way every day 
[12:00:23] <Hunterkll> I used to have a 2 hour commute each way every day at one point
[12:00:29] <lancehead> About an hour long trip with public transport 
[12:00:33] <Hunterkll> but that was on the subway, so i could sleep, laptop, whatever
[12:00:46] <Hunterkll> end of 7 line way out in queens into manhattan lol
[12:00:49] <Cl0udSanta> I'm wfh full time now, my commute is 2 seconds on average lol
[12:01:00] <lancehead> god that makes me fucking jealous lol

[12:03:39] <Hunterkll> we long good on that
[12:03:49] <A-KO> MS patched it in November. Then someone reversed it and did a POC on 12/11 and then the internet flipped the fuck out
[12:03:56] <Hunterkll> ahh
[12:04:31] <A-KO> that's basically what happened
[12:04:38] <A-KO> it would be the talk of the town if it wasn't for log4j

[12:13:00] <lancehead> "Jumped the shark" ? Fuck the what? 
[12:13:07] <Hunterkll> .....
[12:13:08] <SirSantalot> took the words right out of my mouth

[12:13:20] <SirSantalot> who the fuck jumps a shark?
[12:13:25] <lancehead> What in the hell is that saying 
[12:13:27] <Hunterkll> lancehead: that's an actual old ass term too
[12:13:30] <Hunterkll> it's like
[12:13:37] <Hunterkll> the period after when it was getting good/better
[12:13:39] <Hunterkll> and is just going downhill
[12:13:42] <lancehead> Are you jumping off the shark? Or like, doing a sick catpass over a shark? 
[12:13:44] <lancehead> Oh 
[12:13:46] <SirSantalot> do you jump ON it or OVER it?
[12:13:48] <Hunterkll> often used to refer to tv shows or movie franchises
[12:13:57] <lancehead> Or on it yeah @SirSantalot
[12:14:03] <Hunterkll> like you'd say stargate SG-1 really jumped the shark after season 8

[12:14:18] <SirSantalot> oooooooh I need to rewatch that show

[12:14:39] <A-KO> I'll probably stay up all night and clean tbh
[12:14:45] <Hunterkll> yes
[12:14:46] <sd> 10<g​eneraal eric™> I have the entire series :D
[12:14:47] <Hunterkll> that would be a valid usage

[12:15:04] <Hunterkll> basically means that the rest of your life is worthless and meaningless compared to the previous part but ayooo
[12:15:05] <Hunterkll> :P
[12:15:32] <lancehead> In that case, I jumped the shark when my dad came.
[12:15:47] <SirSantalot> man I hope you're talking about your conception

[12:17:48] <SirSantalot> s/fruit/food
[12:17:49] <layer8> SirSantalot meant: "do they have a strict "all food must rhyme" policy?"
[12:17:52] <lancehead> lol no, clean desk policy. That and they don't like people taking breaks outside of breaks
[12:18:05] <Hunterkll> where the fuck do you work

[12:18:11] <SirSantalot> apple :p
[12:18:12] <Hunterkll> administration office for building the great wall of china?
[12:18:18] <Riviera> i never understood how HR has any power over people
[12:18:20] <Riviera> is HR your boss
[12:18:21] <Riviera> ffs
[12:18:22] <Hunterkll> fucking scribe for building a pyramid?
[12:18:22] <Riviera> :|
[12:18:30] <lancehead> No, HR has power over my boss
[12:18:42] <Riviera> but how so
[12:18:48] <lancehead> Good question 
[12:18:56] <lancehead> Because they're professional antfuckers, I guess 
[12:19:05] <Hunterkll> the same way a Corporal MP has power over the base commanding general
[12:19:16] <Hunterkll> by virtue of position/billet as rule enforcers etc 
[12:19:24] <lancehead> Hunterkll: Apart from you and I, I doubt anyone here is gonna get that lol 
[12:19:36] <lancehead> Currently here, anyway
[12:19:49] <SirSantalot> it's used widely in belgium as well lancehead 
[12:20:17] <lancehead> Hunterkll's example? Or calling HR "antfuckers" ? 
[12:20:34] <SirSantalot> I thought you were referring to the term "antfucker"
[12:20:51] <lancehead> Oh nah I was referring to Hunterkll's example using ranks in the military 
[12:20:58] <SirSantalot> ah
[12:21:18] <lancehead> Most people aren't familiar with that ranking structure, unless you're military or a fucking dweeb LARPer like myself 
[12:21:20] <SirSantalot> I got that too, dunno if that was such an obscure reference
[12:21:45] <Hunterkll> i'd say most are, if you aren't a total retard
[12:21:47] <Riviera> perhaps if lancehead would explain it for the mere mortals present
[12:21:56] <Hunterkll> at the very least the difference between enlisted and officers
[12:22:01] <Hunterkll> if not, you suck at being american 
[12:22:12] <SirSantalot> I'm neither, but do know that MP's have power over military. Seeing as they're the military police and all :p
[12:22:19] <lancehead> The non-dweeb larpers present * @Riviera
[12:22:30] <Riviera> ;D
[12:22:37] <Riviera> that must be a military term as well!
[12:22:45] <lancehead> Hunterkll: I suck at being American anyway, I'm Dutch 
[12:23:06] <SirSantalot> worst americans every
[12:23:08] <SirSantalot> ever
[12:23:15] <SirSantalot> you don't even go to jail for smoking pot
[12:23:20] <SirSantalot> you so suck at being american
[12:23:31] <lancehead> Yeah well 
[12:23:34] <Riviera> for jaywalking*
[12:23:43] <lancehead> Your French half are the worst French people on the planet so I win

[12:24:05] <Hunterkll> didn't you hear?
[12:24:07] <Hunterkll> we got rid of those
[12:24:08] <Riviera> yeah the French Dutch are the worst
[12:24:13] <Hunterkll> orchestrated a whole hurricane and everything
[12:24:20] <lancehead> French half of Belgium @Riviera
[12:24:25] <Hunterkll> oh
[12:24:31] <Hunterkll> we just kinda pillaged louisiana to get rid of ours
[12:24:32] <SirSantalot> at least they use a word for "90" lancehead , and don't say "four twenties and ten"
[12:24:37] <Hunterkll> nothing of value was lost
[12:24:49] <lancehead> Okay fair enough, but that's the only redeeming quality SirSantalot
[12:24:50] <Riviera> ah, forgot there was still Belgium around
[12:24:58] <Hunterkll> pretty easy to forget
[12:25:05] <Riviera> happens to the best of us

[12:28:22] <lancehead> Well yeah, but we did the sucking there for several years. New guy has yet to unzip
[12:28:28] <lancehead> I need to fucking stop it's only 10am
[12:28:41] <SirSantalot> i'm not going to talk about war much longer here, but I will say this: I have always been amazed at how hard germany was able to hit in WW2.
[12:29:00] <lancehead> German engineering will do that to you 
[12:29:52] <SirSantalot> anyway
[12:30:09] <lancehead> While the allied forces were still running around with bolt-action rifles and submachine guns firing like 400 rounds per minute, Germany was pumping 1550 rounds per minute out of an MG42
[12:30:24] <lancehead> Germany go brrrr 
[12:30:33] <lancehead> Anyway anyway 
[12:30:51] <lancehead> I love testing security measures, especially when I end up locking myself out of an RPi and having to reflash it 
[12:30:54] <SirSantalot> modern ship-mounted anti-missile defences, those things go brrrr
[12:31:36] <lancehead> So does the A-10 Warthog's 30x173mm cannon 
[12:31:54] <lancehead> Fun fact; the shells it fires are tipped with depleted uranium for bigger boom 
[12:32:15] <Hunterkll> M3 was 450 rounds / minute, the Thompson was 700 rounds / minute or so, M1919 was 500 rounds / minute
[12:32:24] <Hunterkll> M1 Garand wasn't bolt action, nor was the M1 carbine 
[12:32:35] <lancehead> Yeah so like a third / half of an MG42
[12:32:49] <lancehead> Were garands and m1 carbines in wide use? Not until the end of the war right 
[12:32:53] <Hunterkll> which means that the average german would be firing shorter bursts and/or having more ammo supply issues 
[12:34:26] <Hunterkll> lancehead: became standard US service rifle in 1936
[12:34:37] <Hunterkll> replacing the springfield

[12:41:28] <Hunterkll> i could sell it to cover the down payment on two houses at this point
[12:43:42] <lancehead> SirSantalot: The original FN FAL was widely used and very effective in the Rhodesian bush war, which is saying something when it comes to their quality

[12:45:12] <SirSantalot> yay us!
[12:45:40] <Hunterkll> yea too bad you can't have any :P
[12:45:51] <SirSantalot> :(
[12:45:58] <lancehead> Also FN came up with the 5.7x28 cartridge which is one of the most effective small caliber AP rounds out there
[12:46:05] <SirSantalot> at least we have good beer too, I can have that
[12:46:14] <Hunterkll> ugh
[12:46:25] <Hunterkll> the only good thing about 5.7 is it's shared dual purpose use

[14:54:17] <Hunterkll> etc
[14:54:43] <Sousapro> Yeah I'm not convinced that something like vxrails is worth the cost unless you're running VDI
[14:54:57] <Hunterkll> think of like, a rack full of 24-bay disk shelves 
[14:55:06] <Hunterkll> stick comptuers in them instead of having a second rack of computers

[14:55:31] <Sousapro> The installs I've been near have been the most fragile shit I've ever seen
[14:55:47] <Hunterkll> instead of half-deep disk shelves, you're now just using full length 2U servers
[14:55:48] <Hunterkll> eh?
[14:55:57] <sd> 13<C​olour> What you do is you go hyperconverged but when it comes to the budget you keep it as slim as possible right
[14:56:08] <Hunterkll> I mean, I've used VMware vSAN and Windows Storage Spaces Direct and they've both been rock solid....
[14:56:18] <Hunterkll> only thing is you really need to beef up your storage/data network 
[14:56:30] <Hunterkll> like, if you're normally using 10gig for VM interfaces, have storage be 40gig 
[14:56:31] <Hunterkll> etc

[15:03:07] <Sousapro> RIP infra team
[15:03:34] <Hunterkll> but that's the thing.... it includes a ton of shit in the package
[15:03:37] <Hunterkll> if you're not using all of it 
[15:03:45] <Hunterkll> you may as well just buy R750's with VMware and set up vSAN yourself
[15:03:53] <Sousapro> I need cheap compute
[15:03:55] <Sousapro> Yeah
[15:04:00] <Sousapro> That's what I suggested
[15:04:03] <Sousapro> They ignored me
[15:04:15] <Sousapro> They want a homogeneous cluster
[15:04:20] <Hunterkll> like, it includes RecoverPoint, data domain virtual, etc 
[15:04:29] <Sousapro> For VDI workloads to container hosts
[15:04:31] <Hunterkll> comprehensive support package
[15:04:37] <Hunterkll> yea that's not a bad idea
[15:04:39] <Hunterkll> that's what we do 
[15:05:38] <Sousapro> Sure but their cluster is overloaded by shitty call center VDI
[15:05:54] <Hunterkll> literally just add more nodes
[15:05:58] <Hunterkll> it's how the system is designed
[15:06:22] <Sousapro> More like add more nodes, cheap call center siphons compute and we end up boned anyway
[15:06:49] <Hunterkll> I mean, they sound like they'd be a pretty fixed workload, no?
[15:07:21] <Sousapro> Sure, we could soak our budget in offsetting them for now and then get some dedicated compute after that
[15:09:44] <Hunterkll> i mean, you can mount the vSAN datastore on non-vSAN hosts 
[15:09:51] <Sousapro> I'm not saying VXRAILS BAD but I don't think it's always the right option 100 percent of the time
[15:09:59] <Hunterkll> so toss a few 1U's in there as a separate vSphere cluster and use the vxrails storage for it
[15:10:00] <Hunterkll> lol
[15:10:57] <Sousapro> The vxrails storage is IOPS saturated right now 
[15:11:03] <Riviera> other people still buy sans
[15:11:08] <Riviera> :P
[15:11:12] <Hunterkll> ah, so adding more nodes with storage would be the right option 
[15:11:16] <Sousapro> Yeah
[15:11:27] <Hunterkll> you can get lower spec systems for storage-only nodes
[15:11:29] <koollman> I like the idea of hyperconverged infra. But I'm doing it with a bunch of supermicro servers running proxmox and ceph. Very different costs
[15:12:07] <Sousapro> We would just have to subsidize the call center's new hires or wait for them to get infra budget so that they aren't giving us a shitty experience

[17:01:06] <interop_madness> I have only found SMTPDiagPro, I need a lot more configurability
[17:01:17] <koollman> lancehead: yes (for some versions of pi), and no
[17:02:42] <lancehead> Damn, any other ways you know of to protect from USB booting? @koollman
[17:03:57] <koollman> protect ? it's not (at all) a security-oriented device
[17:04:13] <koollman> physical access means the attacker can do whatever
[17:04:26] <lancehead> Yeah that's what we're trying to change

[17:05:30] <koollman> lancehead: there's no tpm or equivalent, no built-in protections that I know of, so you can't do much about it. you can use full disk encryption, and hope the attacker isn't smart/patient

[17:06:53] <Sousapro> interop_madness: it's got some really good detailed logs for most common exchange issues
[17:07:02] <interop_madness> Sousapro, this works for on-prem exchange servers?
[17:07:08] <lancehead> It's not a big deal if it is missing; it was more of a "just in case" measure anyways since we're already disabling usb ports @ koollman
[17:07:36] <Sousapro> interop_madness: it did 18 months ago, try it and let me know
[17:07:51] <lancehead> lol 
[17:07:53] <koollman> lancehead: make a solid metal box around it, weld it shut. :)
[17:08:04] <Sousapro> Reynolds Wrap
[17:08:05] <koollman> or drown it in glue/resin
[17:08:20] <lancehead> Heh, it is in a solid metal box; the machine it's in

[17:10:24] <SirSantalot> good bot

[17:11:40] <koollman> lancehead: I've seen someone make a usb port lookalike ... but if you plugged anything in it, it melted a one-time fuse on the power circuit

[17:12:27] <SirSantalot> koollman's idea might be more realistic though
[17:12:45] <lancehead> Ahh yeah that is cool @koollman. Wouldn't work in our case unfortunately as they're placed all over the world 
[17:12:45] <SirSantalot> but I was going to suggest real vile stuff that would get people's attention, like severy racism

[17:12:58] <koollman> (and the fun part: no boot without the key ... on usb. but the usb key was also modify to not trigger the trap)

[17:13:26] <SirSantalot> how often does that happen?
[17:13:33] <lancehead> I have no idea 
[17:13:37] <lancehead> Physically? Not a lot probably 
[17:13:51] <koollman> lancehead: it's not *that* unreasonable, though
[17:13:59] <lancehead> Over a network? Quite a lot 
[17:14:21] <koollman> physical attacks should never happen, so it shouldn't be a problem. And if it happens often enough, you want something more expensive anyway :)
[17:14:40] <lancehead> Heh true 
[17:14:55] <lancehead> My philosophy was I might as well overdo the physical security since we're only accessing them remotely anyway 
[17:15:00] <lancehead> Won't hinder us at all 
[17:15:32] <SirSantalot> glitter bomb? :)
[17:15:50] <lancehead> That... would hinder us because it might just blow something up 
[17:16:15] <technonerd> just make the intrustion detection say 'gotcha bitch'
[17:16:16] <koollman> besides, it's not your fault someone plugged in a usb device in what looked like a usb port but was actually a three-phase high voltage test port :)
[17:16:18] <SirSantalot> well it doesn't actually have to be a BOMB bomb
[17:16:31] <koollman> it was clearly marked 'do not plug things there' :)
[17:16:34] <SirSantalot> lol
[17:16:41] <SirSantalot> 400V up the wazoo
[17:17:11] <lancehead> lol SirSantalot, I was thinking more like "piece of glitter gets in a place with high voltage and lights the bitch on fire"
[17:17:45] <SirSantalot> well the goal was to deter them, wasn't it?
[17:17:48] <lancehead> Which is bad, considering the hydrogen fuel pump that'll be somewhere nearby 
[17:18:00] <lancehead> Oh yeah they'll be deterred for sure, along with the rest of the block 
[17:18:12] <SirSantalot> I'd be deterred by an open fire near a hydrogen station

[17:18:25] <SirSantalot> not to mention the thing on fire being the thing i'm trying to hack
[17:18:46] <lancehead> I mean to be honest 
[17:19:12] <lancehead> The only reason to get in one of these would be to either get at our logs, steal hydrogen fuel for free, or blow it up
[17:19:25] <lancehead> So there's a 33% chance we're doing their job for them 
[17:19:34] <koollman> maybe mess up with their timing, though :)
[17:19:51] <SirSantalot> lol
[17:20:12] <SirSantalot> I feel there might be simpler ways to blow up a hydrogen station than first hacking into the controller

[17:20:58] <lancehead> The actual fuel is underground
[17:21:06] <lancehead> You'd need to get it to start pumping first

[17:21:52] <lancehead> Hi SantasWiFi 
[17:22:06] <csws> imagining ways to blow up lancehead's hydrogen fuel
[17:22:08] <lancehead> Yeah. Main takeaway here I guess is that blowing it up isn't really a motivation lol 
[17:22:11] <SantasWiFi> xDD
[17:22:13] <csws> so it's alright I guess
[17:22:31] <csws> what if my motivation is to just screw with the dutchies?

[19:54:13] <estranger> but the investors in the notes dont make a dime until we hit $138 so... i feel ok with it
[19:54:19] <tapo> you'd think they'd get eaten by an IBM or something
