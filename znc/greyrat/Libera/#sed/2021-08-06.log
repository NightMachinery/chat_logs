[07:36:35] <edlou> anyone have an idea how i can figure the grep -q for  Active Port: analog-output-lineout;output-speaker  ? the command 
[07:36:35] <edlou> (the command: pactl list sinks | sed -n "/Sink #${sink}/,/Sink #/p" | grep Active)
[07:36:55] <edlou> https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ford-prefect/dee73257edfdb958ffd2710e5d05515b/raw/fadb0d8ee26e746c85665e5ebaa8893e625a33a8/pulseaudio-tail.sh

[07:46:11] <tirnanog> can you rephrase? it's not immediately clear what figure means.
[07:54:44] <edlou> tirnanog: im tryign to extract what device is active for the sinks, but im not sure how to do it, someone was helping me modify that script
[07:58:05] <tirnanog> case "$active port" in *analog-output-lineout*|*output-speaker*) ... that?
[07:58:18] <tirnanog> or grep -qE 'analog-output-lineout|output-speaker'
[07:58:53] <tirnanog> it could be replaced entirely with a case statement.
[08:01:01] <tirnanog> for example: https://termbin.com/y623

[08:33:11] <edlou> tirnanog: i will try and plug and play that
[08:33:20] <edlou> i found something a bit easier i thought i could do myself and trying now :/
[08:33:41] <edlou> https://dpaste.com/54LXS8LP9 - the line 1 prints 2-5 of output, im going to try and sed the Item0: and i think will be easier than the sink
[08:34:57] <edlou> amixer -c 0 sget "Output Select" | awk '/Item0:/{print $NF}'  =D
[08:35:51] <tirnanog> update_sink could just be `pactl get-default-sink` by the way.
[08:36:09] <edlou> tirnanog: there is something under the hood i cant fix and im just trying to hack my way to success :(
[08:36:34] <edlou> https://streamable.com/4iny5z https://streamable.com/2t8hlt -  i cant get pipewire to mix right and its unbearable
[08:36:40] <edlou> i cant adjust the sound or its dead speakers or dead ears
