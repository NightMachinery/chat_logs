[00:09:41] <gumbo> do you guys help with github issues? im getting an error https://dpaste.org/Env5 but can't figure it out, the only thing i did was chmod o+r and g+r do the pub key and now i get this error. what are the permissions for a pub key suppose to be?

[00:13:33] <imMute> things listed in https://serverfault.com/questions/854208/ssh-suddenly-returning-invalid-format might have some useful things though
[00:14:19] <mackerman> Permission denied (publickey)   from a ssh session means it didn't accept your key as auth.  Unrelated to file permissions.
[00:14:55] <imMute> mackerman: the line before that explains why it didn't use the key (it's in an "invalid format" for whatever reason)
[00:15:11] *** Joins: cvmn (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[00:15:57] <imMute> mackerman: permissions on the file could cause the client not to use the key, which would lead to that "Permission denied" error.  the stuff in quotes are the acceptable auth modes, not the one that failed.
[00:17:19] <mackerman> Restore the correct  private key.
[00:17:37] <mackerman> Or, generate a new one,  add it to github, and delete the old one from github.
[00:18:33] <imMute> wait no, gumbo why are you trying to use a *public* key for ssh authentiation?  you need the *private* key on the client side.   that's probably the "invalid format" it's complaining about.

[01:34:44] <jim> hi... what's the difference between "git reset HEAD^" or "git reset --hard HEAD"? is there a typo at the end?
[01:36:23] <ljharb> jim: iirc `HEAD^` is not the same as HEAD, it's the same as `HEAD^1` and it's like `~1` or `~`, but it picks the first parent if the current commit is a merge commit
[01:36:34] <ljharb> jim: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2222920/632724
[01:37:01] <imMute> without --hard it would be --mixed instead
[01:37:09] <mackerman> jim: man gitrevisions
[01:37:09] <gitinfo> jim: the gitrevisions manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/gitrevisions.html
[01:37:19] <mackerman> ^ appended means first parent of that ref
[01:37:52] <mackerman> Also,  --hard is not the default mode of  reset
[01:38:36] <jim> diff bet. --hard and mixed?
[01:38:48] <mackerman> Yes.
[01:39:14] <imMute> yes, --mixed is the default.  --hard and --soft --merge and --keep are the other options
[01:39:33] <imMute> sorry, one too many "and" in there, there's 5 options total.

[01:58:29] <dman777> A couple of months ago a merge was done into our main branch from a qa branch. The qa branch had a lot of commits not in main branch. Is it possible for me to do a git reset hard by date? I would like to test the branch before the large merge of qa into main. However, I was not sure if all the commits from qa branch would be intertwined by date
[01:59:09] <imMute> dman777: the first parent of the merge commit would be sufficient.

[02:01:15] <dman777> in git log that is?
[02:01:40] <imMute> the "by date" doesn't matter.  and you don't need to find that sha, you need the sha of the merge commit itself.  the "^" means the first parent of that commit

[04:49:06] <very_sneaky> bremner: patches via email are just the mechanism for distribution of changes - this is essentially akin to a pull request, it says nothing about the workflow except that the maintainers of the linux kernel accept pull requests
[04:50:23] <very_sneaky> i guess by "serious contenders" I meant, are there any alternatives accepted by the community as "best practice" in some set of situations, where it's a more appropriate choice over workflows like git flow or github flow

[05:02:06] <mackerman> Best practices are merely opinions.
[05:02:45] <very_sneaky> sure, i'm not asking for any objective truth, i'm polling a channel on peoples opinions for viable workflows
[05:02:51] <mackerman> And there will be more than one way to do it, given the very large number of users and their organizational preferences.
[05:04:13] <very_sneaky> my thought was just that people in a topical git chatroom might have well thought through opinions on this
[05:04:26] <very_sneaky> i can then use that to evaluate their appropriateness in my own situations

[05:08:14] <very_sneaky> cheers I'll have a read :)
[05:10:10] <mackerman> Or, start drawing a graph with branches and merges, and come up with something yourself.
[05:10:57] <very_sneaky> yeah, that's an option. I figured I'm probably not the first to tackle this issue though, and it's always good to go through what other people have already put effort into thinking about
[05:11:28] <very_sneaky> there's also an experience factor - some issues i'm sure i don't know that i don't know about

[14:52:26] <Rashad> Hello all o/
[14:53:29] <Rashad> I have a small task which I created a branch for: `improvement/replace-rester-with-okhttp`. I managed to do it all in just one commit. What should the commit message be like?
[14:54:49] <Rashad> And actually in general what should go into a commit message and what should go into a merge/pull request discussion page?
[14:55:21] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[14:55:22] <lericson> the commit should explain the changes it makes
[14:55:53] <Rashad> In this case I created a new Java class and changed one line in one more file.
[14:55:55] <selckin> usually why is more important then what

[14:56:20] <Rashad> Should I try to be brief or verbose in the message?
[14:57:11] <Rashad> My current "understanding" is to be brief in the commit message but verbose in the merge request discussion page.
[14:57:17] <lericson> brief summary in one line, then a longer explanation under it
[14:57:18] <selckin> often a very brief single line is used, followed by empty line, then as verbose as you want, but it all depends on the project, and complexity of the changes
[14:57:25] <lericson> yes
[14:57:30] <Rashad> I see.
[14:57:39] <lericson> and you should avoid explaining your changes outside of git if possible
[14:57:48] <lericson> discussing them is another matter
[14:58:04] <lericson> but you want the next guy to be able to look up the reasoning behind why changes were made
[14:58:06] <Rashad> I see I see.
[14:58:28] <Rashad> So maybe I should link to the discussion page in the commit message... I remember now seeing that done.
[14:58:34] <lericson> imagine you're going to read the commit in a year's time, what is unclear? what needs explaining?
[14:58:56] <Rashad> What if the changes are so simple that they become hard to explain?
[14:59:02] <selckin> yeah if there is an issue tracker, good to mention the issue number etc
[14:59:19] <selckin> Rashad: then nobody will care a year from now
[14:59:28] <Rashad> Ah.
[14:59:39] * Rashad brb, sorry, been called for
[14:59:58] <selckin> the rules are very different if its a 1-3 man project for example, or if 20+ people are working together

[19:37:38] <escherial> hey, our lab often has web apps with large data components, and the tactic so far has been to put them in lfs...this creates a bit of an issue when i want to dockerize the app, as i need to create the image without the data, then somehow pull it into the container at runtime, implying i need the git metadata in the image

[20:03:01] <OnlineCop> wwwi: Essentially, yes. It will reset what your current branch is currently pointing at, back to <commit-id>. This won't modify the files in your working area, so you'll see all those files as Modified.

[20:08:01] <OnlineCop> wwwi: You mean your local `.git` repository? Yes, they will be there. I usually use `git reset --hard <commit-id>` so it will both change to that <commit-id>, but also set all the files to that version.

[20:38:10] <OnlineCop> All 3 options (`--soft`, `--mixed`, `--hard`) will reset the index.
[20:38:15] <OnlineCop> `--hard` changes the working tree, and any changes to tracked files since <commit-id> will be discarded.
[20:38:19] <OnlineCop> `--mixed` (default behavior) changes the index file, but doesn't change the working tree, so changed files are preserved but aren't marked for commit (you have to `git add` them yourself).
[20:38:23] <OnlineCop> `--soft` doesn't change the index file nor the working tree, so changed files are preserved but ARE marked for commit (as though you had `git add`ed them).
