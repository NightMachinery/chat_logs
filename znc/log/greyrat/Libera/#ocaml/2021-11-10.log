[02:53:28] <p4bl0> Hi all. Is it normal that even in the context of line 7 here where we statically know that `f` is a record with a field `n` this code raises an error? https://pastebin.com/HiWy81Xj
[02:53:53] <p4bl0> if the record was not inlined in the ADT it would work
[02:55:23] <p4bl0> and I would understand that it wouldn't work if the function `string_of_foo` was defined elsewhere out of context because its argument would have no known type, but here it seems feasible to type it properly
[02:55:58] <p4bl0> but maybe I don't see the difficulty of typing this?
[02:59:50] <zozozo> p4bl0: the function string_of_foo is closed, so it's essentially the same as being defined at toplevel
[03:01:06] <zozozo> plus, the type of the inner record is a bit special, and e.g. cannot escape the branch expression (e.g. you cannot return the record alone), plus I'm pretty sure that this type cannot be inferred as the type of a function parameter (mainly because of the escaping concerns)
[03:03:54] <zozozo> if `x` was typable/inferrable to be of the type of the inner record, then it could escape the scope of the pattern matching branch, and be returned as a standalone value, which is forbidden
[03:10:22] <p4bl0> I see
[03:10:26] <p4bl0> thanks zozozo :)

[18:06:09] <d_bot> <Alistair> With `ppx_let`, is it possible to doing something like `let%A.bind x = ... in let%B.map x = ... in ...`, where `A` and `B` are modules w/ `Let_syntax`s
[18:11:48] <d_bot> <VPhantom> Not that I know of. You need to open a module which defines bind and map functions ahead of using let%bind, let%map & co.
[18:20:36] *** ccx_ is now known as ccx
[18:32:32] <d_bot> <Anurag> Yes it is. You can qualify which module's Let_syntax to use for the ppx. ex:
[18:32:33] <d_bot> <Anurag> ```ocaml
[18:32:35] <d_bot> <Anurag> let baz x =
[18:32:36] <d_bot> <Anurag>   let%map.Deferred x = foo x in
[18:32:37] <d_bot> <Anurag>   let%bind.Or_error y = bar x in
[18:32:38] <d_bot> <Anurag>   Or_error.return (y + 2)
[18:32:40] <d_bot> <Anurag> ;;
[18:32:41] <d_bot> <Anurag> ```
[18:33:33] <d_bot> <VPhantom> I stand corrected.
