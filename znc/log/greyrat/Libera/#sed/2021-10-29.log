[00:24:38] <emanuele6> actually, you could make that shorter by not using `-n' and using `d' instead of `n'  
[00:24:50] <emanuele6> sed -e 's/first/edit/' -e 'tx' -e 'd' -e ':x' -e 's/second/edit/'
[00:25:32] <lopid> even shorter if you leave out the quotes
[00:25:55] <e36freak> yay golfing
[00:25:58] <emanuele6> i was referring to sed commands, but sure
[00:26:07] <e36freak> i think you can also do -e 'd; :x'
[00:26:15] <e36freak> maybe even without a space
[00:26:22] <emanuele6> in gnu sed
[00:26:35] <emanuele6> where you don't even need the label because you can use T
[00:27:49] <emanuele6> sed -n 's/first/edit/;T;s/second/edit/;p'
[00:27:53] <e36freak> you can definitely do 's/first/edit/;tx'
[00:29:29] <emanuele6> e36freak: yes, but if you allow gnu sed, you don't even need the label because you can use T as shown above
[00:29:50] <emanuele6> ; as command delimiter is GNU sed specific
[00:30:24] <emanuele6> oh, wait. is it?
[00:32:22] <emanuele6> i thought it was because of what Riviera said
[00:40:11] <emanuele6> nevermind then, it seems like ; as command delimiter is portable
[01:13:32] <e36freak> should be
[01:13:36] <e36freak> not after a label though
[01:13:45] <e36freak> POSIXly you need a newline after a label
[01:13:54] <e36freak> (or separate -e which is the same thing)

[17:44:41] <clarkk> I need to extract certain messages from a notifications file using tail, using the static file, but also following it so I get the latest messages from the system.  It works great when I just use tail normally, but doesn't produce any output when I follow the file.  Can anyone tell me how to make it work?  http://paste.debian.net/hidden/0909c309/
[17:46:10] <lopid> if the file gets rotated, you'll have you use tail -F instead
[17:47:06] <Soliton> use a single sed invocation.
[17:47:16] <lopid> and maybe -u?
[17:47:48] <Soliton> then you shouldn't need -u.
[17:48:15] <clarkk> I tried for many hours trying to use one invocation, but failed miserably
[17:50:43] <lopid> do the last 10 lines of the file actually contain something that would produce output after going through the seds?
[17:51:36] <Soliton> well, you have to write your sed code accordingly. if you print stuff then that's it it's printed even if you wanted further changes.
[17:56:00] <e36freak> !faq buffer
[17:56:03] <clarkk> The reason for two invocations is that I need sed in silent mode first to obtain the messages I'm interested in, and then format it in the second invocation
[17:56:06] <e36freak> oh, wrong channel
[17:56:14] <e36freak> clarkk: you can select and format at the same time
[17:56:51] <clarkk> lopid, yes, it they do contain something that would be output
[17:57:14] <Soliton> either delete every other line or just do your transforms and print the matching lines.
[17:57:23] <e36freak> but it's a buffering problem
[17:57:32] <clarkk> I really have no idea how to achieve it
[17:57:43] <Soliton> sure, but only because of chaingin sed for no reason.
[17:57:51] <e36freak> !d instead of -n p and then combining the two may be enough
[17:58:15] <Soliton> i have no idea what /foo/,+p even does.
[17:58:22] <e36freak> also see https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/009
[17:58:31] <Soliton> perhaps it assumes a 1.
[18:01:22] <clarkk> typo obviously. I'll correct it in my code, thanks.
[18:03:35] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[18:04:18] <clarkk> e36freak, It would be too much to match everything I don't want. I need to match things I want

[18:05:13] <clarkk> I don't get it
[18:06:41] <Soliton> /^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}\|Shown\|Normal\|.+(somewebsite\.|www\.somewebsite\.com\.)/!d

[19:02:44] <clarkk> Soliton, that works. If I split it over two lines (without the OR in parenthesis) it doesn't work. Can you tell me why?
