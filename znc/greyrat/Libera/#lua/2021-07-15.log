[01:25:30] <jaawerth> ard:  yeah python may have added a lambda keyword, but coding in a functional style in python takes a little elbow grease due to how imperative and declarative it is, and also it goes against the general community I've seen people talk about python code making heavy use of e.g. https://github.com/pytoolz/toolz as "not pythonic"
[01:25:51] <jaawerth> and I found lambda annoying to use in python vs, well, any lisp or even JS
[01:26:03] <jaawerth> though strictly speaking they should all be unary functions and very few languages actually do that
[01:26:13] <jaawerth> if you want the "like lambda calculus" part
[01:26:57] <jaawerth> but currying is ugly as hell in dynamic langs
[01:27:10] <jaawerth> (by which I mean buggy)
[01:27:55] <Tricycle> I'm not sure how possible it is to write code that treat functions just like any other data type in a language where indentation matters like in Python.
[01:27:56] <Tricycle> Then I'm not really sure what define being functional.

[21:40:58] <ard> bleeh...
[21:41:31] <ard> you just switch the function name for lambda, hussle some things and then create a random function name.

[21:41:42] <tumn> it's technically possible to declare, define, and call a function in C without ever giving it an identifier but it's not practical or useful and it would only work on your machine
