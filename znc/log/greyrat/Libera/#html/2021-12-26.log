[03:35:39] <Lukky> Trying to get back into html/js after quite a long hiatus... I'm sing Chrome's dev tools to follow through a request, and then this stuff from Kaspersky is showing up in the console... how is it "hooked" in there?
[03:35:50] <Lukky> using*
[03:37:15] <ham5> an extention?
[03:38:12] <Lukky> more than likely... I just can't remember how to "find" where it's being called from exactly
[03:38:43] <Lukky> Should I be able to see extensions in the dev tools window?
[03:40:11] <ham5> uh, you can see your extentions in more tools > extensions
[03:40:57] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:41:51] <Lukky> yes, sure, but I thought I could see where/when it's getting "hooked" in the network trace, or some other tool window...
[03:43:19] <ham5> thats probably more of a chrome specific question, I have no idea
[03:43:45] <Lukky> my guess too...
[03:43:48] <ham5> why is it even a problem or concern that it is there
[03:44:16] <Lukky> not really an issue, juste trying to get back on the saddle after a while :-)
[03:45:51] <Lukky> I want to look at "pure" stuff... I could disable all extensions, but then I'll have to remeber which I tutned off, etc... I could swear there was a way to "intercept" those from the dev tool, but that's my memory playing tricks for sure lol

[03:52:44] <Lukky> Ahhh... it's Kaspersky setting... I could have sworn there was a "centralized" way to prevent those inhected scripts globally...
