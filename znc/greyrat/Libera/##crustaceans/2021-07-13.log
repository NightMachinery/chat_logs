[01:22:36] <quanticle> Okay, having read the article... I'm no fan of crypto but this article is just shockingly bad
[01:22:52] <riv> woz is doing bitcoin now too
[01:23:32] <quanticle> I thought he was doing NFTs, which are on Ethereum.
[01:23:56] <riv> yeah by "bitcoin" i mean any of those things
[01:30:15] <wrl> all cryptocurrencies look the same to me

[08:16:31] <buttsbot> Twitter - The_Law_Boy - the rise of Elon has been a huge benefit to everyone making the argument that billionaires don't deserve their money
[08:22:28] <quanticle> I don't see how that follows. Is Elon any more ridiculous than Jeff Bezos? Bill Gates?
[08:22:38] <quanticle> Heck Henry Ford was practically a Nazi.
[08:23:28] <quanticle> To be clear, I don't think *any* billionaires "deserve" that much wealth. But I don't think Elon is any better or worse in that regard.
[08:25:17] <companion_cube> same
[08:26:16] <martian67> he more publicly makes an ass out of himself
[08:27:50] <quanticle> Sure. No argument there. But in terms of actual accomplishment, I think Elon has done more. Certainly, I think setting up an electric car company is probably, on net, better than holding back computing for about a decade while you reap massive monopoly profits.
[08:28:06] <martian67> he didn't setup tesla
[08:28:14] <martian67> which is yet another one of the cons he pulls lol
[08:29:07] <quanticle> Fair enough, but he is the CEO, and Tesla is probably better for the world than Microsoft.
[08:29:17] <martian67> like most rich parasites hes great at taking credit for other people's work
[08:29:28] <quanticle> Ray Kroc didn't invent McDonalds either
[08:29:58] <quanticle> But without him McDonalds would have been just some random restaurant in San Bernadino

[18:00:01] <companion_cube> cars suck
[18:00:06] <mouseghost> nuu
[18:00:06] <companion_cube> they're dangerous
[18:00:07] <mouseghost> cars are nice
[18:00:15] <companion_cube> they take space
[18:00:28] <companion_cube> they're unsafe to me as a cyclist and pedestrian
[18:03:46] <mouseghost> idk

[18:04:27] <mouseghost> cycling is nice also, but often infeasible when the points are too far

[18:35:47] <gerikson> ok... so an inflatable object is inserted into ... orifices, and inflated?
[18:36:13] <gerikson> that horrible Pike/Devault slash taught be about fire play
[18:36:55] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: no you inject saline into various body parts so they expand
[18:37:07] <gerikson> I heard about an Etsy-type artist, working in wool, who made good money knitting stuff for people who liked being smothered in wook
[18:37:10] <ngoldbaum> also apparently safe for the most part your body just absorbs the water

[20:54:23] <bontaq> love some hard seltzers when it's like 95F
[20:57:54] <companion_cube> what even is it? fizzy water with alcohol in it?
[21:00:38] <bontaq> yep, you too can experience it by getting a flavored seltzer and throwing a shot of vodka in it (and maybe something to sweeten it slightly)
[21:02:19] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: malted beer minus the beer
[21:02:28] <bontaq> the whole beer industry is losing their minds over it because it's like, "wait we don't even have to try?  they just want bubbly grain alcohol?"
[21:02:39] <ngoldbaum> you just need a brewer’s license to make it so it’s bit easier to get into the market than distilling
[21:03:06] <gerikson> LOL
[21:03:08] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: sad
[21:03:10] <bkero> There's a limited audience for it
[21:03:24] <gerikson> apparently it's a "healthier" booze
[21:03:29] <bkero> and from the data I've seen it's mostly cannibalizing cider sales
[21:03:31] <companion_cube> that sounds awful :D
[21:03:41] <companion_cube> I mean, wheat beer is nice in the summer
[21:03:42] <gerikson> tbh most ciders are too sweet
[21:03:47] <companion_cube> why put alcohol if there's no taste
[21:03:58] <bkero> For the same reason as 'light beer'
[21:31:23] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: fewer calories and people who have converted from soda to sparkling waters have an alcohol they can go for
[21:31:30] <ngoldbaum> that said white claw is garbage
[21:32:06] <ngoldbaum> although it’s kinda a scam that alcohol doesn’t have nutrition info on the label
[21:32:11] <companion_cube> didn't realize beer was for people drinking soda
[21:32:17] <ngoldbaum> it should i bet people would be surprised
[21:33:30] <companion_cube> +1 for the nutrition info
[21:37:53] <Geekingfrog> isn't alcohol pure poison from a nutrition stand point ?
[21:38:21] <ngoldbaum> yeah a shot of vodka is like 100 calories
[21:38:33] <ngoldbaum> and that’s low calorie for booze
[21:38:59] <companion_cube> Geekingfrog: sure, but it doesn't come pure
[21:39:05] <companion_cube> a beer can be pretty calory-rich
