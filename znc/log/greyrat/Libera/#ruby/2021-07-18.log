[01:54:41] <rg1> i dont rely on an external dependency that's not part of Ruby and it is a simple process: `gem install -g gem.dep.rb` installs the gems and doesnt utilize sandboxing, at least not for now
[01:57:55] <weaksauce> rg1 bundler has been a part of ruby since 2.6
[02:02:28] <rg1> oh really? i didnt know that. well, there's a parallel effort in rubygems so i'm not sure where that will end up.
[02:04:50] <rg1> in any case i think i prefer rubygems effort for its simplicity. you don't have to initialize a sandbox, or `bundle exec` commands.

[04:34:43] <seydar> so that makes me think that the DB calls are not actually being processed in parallel, and that there appears to be substantial overhead in the context switching
[04:36:25] <adam12> seydar: I'd try turning on WAL.
[04:36:46] <adam12> seydar: Actually, nm. You said reads. Hmm.
[04:40:56] <adam12> seydar: I guess you'd have to benchmark it to see if you can see the bottleneck. Could it be IO bound?

[04:50:46] <Dreeg> a = '        const match = name.match(/(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})((|-)\d{2}:\d{2})/);'
[04:50:55] <Dreeg> a.gsub(/\(\\d\{4\}\-\\d\{2\}\-\\d\{2\}\)\(\-\\d\{2\}\:\\d\{2\}\)/, '(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})((\+|-)\d{2}:\d{2})')

[05:03:30] <Dreeg> hi adam12, thanks in advance! Nice Regexp.escape! Thank you, but in this case is not the problem. Regexp match correctly.
[05:04:15] <Dreeg> I know :(  but my problem is that I'm using a Chef Cookbook (Line) and I can't change the mode of using gsub. I can change just the arguments.
[05:04:21] <adam12> >> 'const match = name.match(/(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})((|-)\d{2}:\d{2})/);'.gsub("/(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})((|-)\d{2}:\d{2})/", '(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})((\+|-)\d{2}:\d{2})')

[05:06:29] <Dreeg> More simply: 'hi'.gsub(/i/, '\+')
[05:06:46] <Dreeg> >> 'hi'.gsub(/i/, '\+')
[05:07:28] <Dreeg>  => "h"
[05:07:35] <adam12> Dreeg: This is weird, and I'm having deja-vu kinda. Maybe if havenwood is around, he might remember this.
[05:08:21] <Dreeg> I hope! 
[05:08:34] <aesthetikx> wait what that is weird
[05:08:52] <Dreeg> Meanwhile, thanks for the answers and the tag to those who might know the solution
[05:09:00] <aesthetikx> I thought anything in single quotes was interpereted literally
[05:09:36] <Dreeg> I thought so too
[05:10:24] <Dreeg> I think GSub is a joking people :') 
[05:10:45] <aesthetikx> so
[05:11:04] <aesthetikx> stuff like '\1' refers to the first group caputre, is '\+' doing something similar?
[05:11:19] <adam12> >> 'hi'.gsub(/i/, "\+")
[05:11:20] <ruby[bot]> adam12: # => "h+" (https://carc.in/#/r/bkpb)
[05:11:39] <Dreeg> Exactly, I'm writhing this with double quote hehehehe is so strange!
[05:12:00] <Dreeg> Ok aesthetikx but with '\\+' still didn't work :\  
[05:12:13] <aesthetikx> seems like '\+' is referrring to a match, check like
[05:12:22] <Dreeg> Like with "\\+" that is egual to '\+'
[05:12:31] <Dreeg> How can I avoid that?
[05:12:35] <aesthetikx> >> 'abcd'.gsub(/(ab)/, '\+\+\+')

[05:14:34] <aesthetikx> nevermind that link is not even related to this, just how to escape +

[05:16:23] <aesthetikx> https://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ref_c_string.html If you go to the gsub section this at least explains whats happening, \+ is the highest numbered capture group

[18:49:42] <michigan> whats up guys, was curious which one you prefer, #{ foo } or #{foo}?
[18:49:59] <michigan> i've always used the former but my lab partner prefers the latter and now we're fighting over which to use
[18:52:27] <michigan> i use [foo] however
[19:01:09] <nakilon> #{foo}
[19:03:03] <nakilon> basically put spaces only: 1. around operators 2. after ",", ";" 3. around |arg| 4. in between multiple bracket to make them read easier like when [{[({[{
[19:04:10] <michigan> hmmm
[19:05:42] <nakilon> and it's awful when people place space before { -- it has no purpose is an obvious inconsistency because after } they don't put the space when there is method chaining
[19:06:22] <nakilon> also why you don't put space before[ and ( ? exactly, no sense
[19:07:30] <michigan> true..
[19:08:12] <michigan> i guess i just found { more visually disturbing, like it was begging me for extra space
[19:08:43] <michigan> no more space for you little one, thanks nakilon 
[19:08:55] <aesthetikx> "A #{b} c".tap { |x| x }.map(&:upcase)
[19:09:00] <aesthetikx> that is my preferences
[19:09:46] <aesthetikx> unless we are in a seattle style codebase ;)   .map &:upcase
[19:10:08] <nakilon> seattle/google is a good one
[19:11:34] <nakilon> it was a pleasure discover that they write like I do and not like the 99%
[19:13:26] <aesthetikx> yeah its objectively more ruby like but I understand why some (most) codebases dont use it
[19:13:40] <aesthetikx> i only do it that way on small or personal projects when I am going for poetry
[19:14:30] <nakilon> why? because they had no codestyle so they have adopted the most advertised one (that was the one made by a guy with no experience)
[19:14:58] <aesthetikx> haha are you referring to something specific

[19:15:24] <nakilon> can't tell more
[19:15:32] <aesthetikx> at google are you saying?
[19:15:39] <aesthetikx> i didn't know they even wrote ruby over there
[19:16:28] <nakilon> most (if not all) of the Google Cloud SDK team is there
[19:16:58] <aesthetikx> in seattle? wait are you arguing for or against seattle style
[19:17:03] <aesthetikx> brb
[19:17:07] <nakilon> for
[19:17:52] <nakilon> in the above message with "they had no codestyle" I mean not seattle but the majority of ruby newcomers
[19:18:11] <nakilon> for lots of people it's either first lang or the 2nd after php
[19:18:39] <nakilon> at least it's what I see around
[19:19:42] <nakilon> at prevprevious job I was replaced by a student that didn't yet finish his study and jumper into coding in ruby "because it's the highest paid lang on market here" he said
[19:20:06] <nakilon> *jumped
[19:24:11] <nakilon> 99% of IT development in Russia is making websites (half is an outsource orders from Europe) and it's shifting from php to rails, and it's cheaper to hire students, so how much experience would you expect to be put into chosing the codestyle, practices, patterns, etc.
[19:26:45] <nakilon> it's a huge business of paid courses since majority don't understand a single word in English and no one writes free Russian educational websites, books, etc. (the only one was in Wikibooks and no one advertises it because...) so people finish the basic school and asks parents money for a course
[19:29:47] <nakilon> that is usually a low effort short articles in random order and after you finish it you are kind of able to make websites that is as I said the main job here; yesterday I saw someone called his course business a "Rails faculty", like in some university _<>
