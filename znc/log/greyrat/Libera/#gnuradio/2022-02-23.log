[03:40:56] <Revan> Hey everybody, I'm struggling to understand what I'm missing in my gnuradio design. I'm performing a loopback circuit. The goal is to successfully transmit a chunk of 1s to my reciever and decode them
[03:42:04] <Revan> Any suggestions? I've been following the gnuradio tutorials. I'm using PSK for modulation
[03:44:35] <BarryDuggan[m]> Revan: are you referring to simulation or over the air transmission?
[03:44:59] <Revan> transmission via coax line from Tx to Rx
[03:45:03] <Revan> no antennas
[03:45:20] <Revan> I simulated it with a channel module first
[03:45:27] <BarryDuggan[m]> hopefully using an attenuator!
[03:45:49] <Revan> D: \
[03:46:11] <BarryDuggan[m]> continuous or burst data?
[03:46:35] <Revan> I should mention that I'm a noob with gnuradio. It's continuous data. I'm using the constant source block
[03:47:13] <BarryDuggan[m]> what hardware?
[03:47:24] <Revan> I'm using a USRP N200
[03:49:44] <BarryDuggan[m]> do you see any data on the receive side (frequency sink or waterfall sink)?
[03:50:41] <Revan> On my receiving end, I have a polyphase clock sync -> CMA Equalizer -> Costas Loop -> Constellation Decoder -> Differential Decoder -> Map -> Unpack 2 Bits -> Char to Float -> QT GUI Time Sink
[03:50:48] <Revan> Yes, I do see data
[03:51:33] <Revan> I have a circle for my constellation chart. However it fluxates its pattern based on my equalizer rate
[03:52:11] <BarryDuggan[m]> BPSK or QPSK?
[03:52:35] <Revan> From what I understand, I should be seeing a group of points in the -45 degree quadrant of the constellation chart for a constant source of 1s
[03:53:47] <BarryDuggan[m]> sounds like QPSK. the circle should be a cluster of points.
[03:53:49] <Revan> I based it on the Guided PSK Demodulation Tutorial
[03:55:04] <Revan> It's QPSK
[03:55:24] <BarryDuggan[m]> go back to that and compare every block of your transmit and receive to see what is different.
[03:55:24] <BarryDuggan[m]> have you successfully done the last step of that tutorial?
[03:56:18] <Revan> I did everything with a channel block for simulation purposes. This is the first time I'm implementing the UHD: USRP Source and Sink
[03:56:33] <BarryDuggan[m]> also make sure you have the sample rates correct for the N200
[03:56:54] <Revan> They should all be the same sample rate, right?
[03:57:01] <BarryDuggan[m]> * sample rates are correct for
[03:58:12] <BarryDuggan[m]> I don't know much about the N200, but I think you will have to resample to a higher rate for it.
[03:58:40] <BarryDuggan[m]> there are minimums for USRPs
[03:58:54] <Revan> Is there some way for me to show you my grc design?
[03:59:18] <BarryDuggan[m]> pastebin the grc file
[03:59:23] <Revan> I'm an undergrad college student with no comm class experience
[03:59:26] <Revan> ok thank you
[04:00:51] <BarryDuggan[m]> you need some comm experience to work with GNU Radio on the air

[04:14:02] <Revan> I'm running it in a custom raspberry pi image
[04:15:00] <BarryDuggan[m]> why did you choose a sample rate of 195312?

[04:16:46] <Revan> I remember reading that as the USRP sampling rate
[04:17:04] *** Joins: harish (~harish@158.140.144.42)
[04:17:15] <BarryDuggan[m]> what model of rPi do you have? 3B+, 4, ?
[04:17:24] <Revan> 4
[04:18:38] <Revan> should my sampling rate be the same as the USRP clock rate?
[04:18:46] <BarryDuggan[m]> like I say, I'm not familiar with the N200, but for my B200 I use 768K.
[04:19:06] <Revan> Why that frequency?
[04:19:26] <BarryDuggan[m]> I use a lower sample rate and the interpolate before the USRP sink
[04:19:59] <BarryDuggan[m]> on receive I decimate from the USRP source to do the rest of the processing
[04:20:37] <Revan> Why do you decimate?
[04:20:38] <BarryDuggan[m]> otherwise your rPi probably won't keep up
[04:20:44] <Revan> oh gotcha
[04:21:17] <Revan> I'm getting more saved data on my rx side than on my tx side
[04:21:24] <Revan> Is that normal
[04:21:35] <BarryDuggan[m]> all of the signal processing except for the tx and rx can be done at lower rates
[04:21:46] <BarryDuggan[m]> saved data?
[04:22:16] <Revan> I'm saving data to files using the file sink blocks [currently disabled
[04:22:17] <Revan> ]
[04:22:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> In general, sample-rates with USRPs must be a proper whole fraction of the master clock rate, with factor-of-2 and factor-of-4 generally providing better performance.  On the B200-family in particular, the master clock rate is quite flexible and UHD will pick a master clock rate that is appropriate for the desired sample rate.

[04:23:21] <BarryDuggan[m]> Revan has an N200
[04:23:39] <patchvonbraun[m]> Ah, then you have to pick a sample rate that is a whole fraction of 100MHz.
[04:24:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> With the largest denominator (lowest sample rate) being 512 as I recall.
[04:24:38] <patchvonbraun[m]> Hence the 195312

[04:28:02] <Revan> So do I need to decimate my data then? Is the rpi too slow to keep up with the constant influx of data?
[04:29:59] <BarryDuggan[m]> Revan: so if you bypass the USRP source and sink and just connect the Constellation Modulator to the Polyphase Clock Sync, does it work?
[04:30:10] <Revan> From what I understand, I thought the Polyphase Clock Sync is already downsampling my data
[04:30:43] <Revan> Good point. I'll check
[04:31:39] <BarryDuggan[m]> the Clock Sync changes the sps from 4 to 2
[04:32:06] <BarryDuggan[m]> 195kHz is not too high

[18:11:03] <MarcinP[m]> Guys, what happened to the OOT modules like gr-adsb? I can see that this module is available as a recipe to install through PyBOMBS but the source code was written to work with GNU Radio 3.7. What should I do to get it work under 3.10? Rewrite it under 3.10 and recompile? How to deal with that? Or maybe somebody have done it already? 
[18:12:03] *** Quits: Rayston (~Rayston3@98.186.218.138) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[18:12:18] <funkylab[m]> many good questions!
[18:12:18] <funkylab[m]> First, check whether there's already a git branch that supports 3.10 (or 3.9, which is near-identical, or 3.8, which is still pretty close). 
[18:12:55] <funkylab[m]> if there isn't, yep, you'll have to rework it to work with 3.10! We do have a migration guide, but only for >=3.8 to 3.10
[18:13:06] <DerekKozel[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Tutorials
[18:13:18] <DerekKozel[m]> That's not true Marcus :D
[18:13:27] <DerekKozel[m]> We have 3.7 to 3.8 as well
[18:13:40] <funkylab[m]> ah yes, but we don't cover 3.7->3.9 or 3.7->3.10
[18:13:42] <funkylab[m]> right?
[18:13:52] <muaddib[m]> Right
[18:14:03] <DerekKozel[m]> No, individual steps
[18:15:06] <DerekKozel[m]> Which does mean some work is repeated, but usually it is the simple (but sometime labor intensive) part of running gr_modtool to create the structure of the block files and copy and pasting the code into the new template.
[18:15:48] <funkylab[m]> in this particular case, gr-adsb https://github.com/wnagele/gr-adsb seems to be pretty dead 
[18:16:30] <DerekKozel[m]> But the XML->YAML, Python 2->3, and SWIG -> Pybind11 steps are done once only and usually it is possible to do those entirely separately so it is possible to test that it is done correctly before starting the next update step
[18:16:57] <DerekKozel[m]> The other thing to look for is if someone else has already done some of the updating. In this case https://github.com/mhostetter/gr-adsb works for 3.8
[18:17:29] <funkylab[m]> I've only cursorily skimmed decoder.py from that repo, and it might be predating the popularity of message handling, i.e. has a separate decoder thread, where you'd probably don't want one

[18:19:26] <funkylab[m]> it would probably be easier than to forward-port this, but that's really a wild guess, and "easier" is very subjective
[18:20:38] <funkylab[m]> I think Chris Kuethe  was actually the last to touch it, maybe he knows a modern port of the functionality anyways!
[18:22:04] *** Rayston1 is now known as Rayston
[18:22:59] <DerekKozel[m]> Marcin, I saw you're interested in doing some documentation work (and the Soapy blocks would be excellent!). If you are doing some OOT updating work your thoughts and additions to those porting pages would be very welcome. I think it would be valuable to have a summary page other than the Tutorials page which links to each 3.Y -> 3.Y+1 porting guide for OOTs and to the flowgraphs porting guide for details.
[18:24:00] <DerekKozel[m]> I think those porting guides are factual and I've been able to update many OOTs using them, but I've also heard that they are lacking in detail and clearer advice on how to do each portion of the work.
[18:27:10] <BarryDuggan[m]> I wrote that as a stop-gap effort. something is better than nothing ðŸ˜‰  I welcome all improvements!
[18:28:34] <DerekKozel[m]> :D They're massively better than nothing!
[18:28:38] <MarcinP[m]> <DerekKozel[m]> "Marcin, I saw you're interested..." <- Yes, that's true I am happy to help. I will get back to Barry Duggan to get more info. I think I will do it in the weekend 
[18:28:48] <DerekKozel[m]> And it's far easier to modify something that already exists than it is to start from a blank page :)

[19:57:32] <Revan> If I'm running a coax line from Tx to Rx, shouldn't my BER be 0?
[19:58:06] <Revan> I'm a noob to SDRs
[19:58:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> Revan: Hopefully with a crap-tonne of *attenuation* in that line?  Otherwise you'll, best-case, be driving the rX into non-linearity, and worst-case, damaging it.
[19:58:52] <Revan> wait really?
[19:59:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> Well, yes.  Receivers are intended to receiver incredibly-weak signals from antennas, NOT the direct signals from a transmitter.  
[20:00:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> A signal presented at a modern receiver that is, let's say, -60dBm integrated power is what we call "thunderbanging strong".
[20:00:11] <Revan> Okay that makes sense. Do you have any suggestions for how much attenuation?
[20:00:26] <patchvonbraun[m]> Most receivers, at max gain, can easily "see" narrowband signals down to -120dBm or lower.
[20:00:38] <patchvonbraun[m]> Revan: 30dB minimum
[20:01:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> This is why it's useful to know some RF electronics even when playing with SDRs--because a goodly part of the overall system has nothing to do with software.
[20:01:41] <Revan> Can I set the USRP attenuation by setting the "Gain Value" in my USRP Sink block? Is that the correct way of thinking or do I need a physical pad in-between my Tx and Rx?
[20:02:18] <patchvonbraun[m]> I you haven't already, I'd suggest getting a copy (used is fine) of the ARRL Radio Amateurs Handbook, any edition issued in the last 20 years is fine.  Read all the theory chapters.
[20:02:39] <patchvonbraun[m]> Revan: That may not provide enough signal attenuation.
[20:02:52] <patchvonbraun[m]> Which USRP do you have?
[20:03:02] <Revan> I'll do that. I'm using a USRP N200
[20:03:23] <Myon> Revan: many SDRs spew out crap when powered on, so relying on config settings might not be enough
[20:03:41] <Revan> I have it reconfigured
[20:03:46] <Myon> if you don't have an attenuator but want to start Really Now, try without the cable
[20:03:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> So most of the daughtercards on that device have a max output of about 10dBm, and a gain-control range of 31.5dB, which means you'd stil be sending about -20dBm towards the RX
[20:04:54] <Revan> Myon what do you mean?
[20:05:24] <Myon> just the bare SMA connectors, there will still be a signal on the other side
[20:05:37] <Revan> patchvonbraun[m] my Gain Value is curretnly set to 0
[20:05:39] <Myon> possibly put a cm of wire in there
[20:06:09] <Myon> (warnings about TX mismatch apply, but 10mW should destroy the sender, I'd hope)
[20:06:13] <Revan> I'm using an sma cable
[20:06:24] <Myon> remove the cable, use the air
[20:06:55] <Myon> but really get an attenuator before blaming me for silly suggetions
[20:07:00] <Revan> How would that be beneficical? Aren't the sma ports horrible antennas
[20:07:05] <patchvonbraun[m]> Revan: Yeah, so that means about -20dBm into the cable.  That's not damage territory usually, but it *IS* non-linearity territory.
[20:07:09] <Myon> horrible = attenuation
[20:07:54] <Revan> patchvonbraun[m] any suggestions for a good gain value? This is my first time working with an SDR
[20:08:14] <Revan> Myon haha fair enough

[20:09:50] <Revan> okay gotcha
[20:10:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> With 30dB of attenuation in-line, that will present to the RX port as a fairly-decently-loud -50dBm signal or thereabouts.  Or probably 10dB less than that if you're just going to use "spillage" between ports.

[20:15:06] <Revan> So I'm modulating and demodulating using QPSK.

[21:11:08] <electrokitty> Revan: IIRC, the gain value in the USRP sink only adjusts the LNA gain, so a value of 0 will approximately result in the received signal at approximately the same level it is on the wire/antenna
[21:12:37] <electrokitty> You can adjust the output level, but I would always use physical attenuation to remove the possibility of damage. The USRPs like to spew out a bunch of noise when tuning as well, and that can also be above the configured output level

[21:18:39] <LordKalma> the URSP docs recoment 30dB attenuators for loopbacking
[21:18:45] <LordKalma> *recommends
[21:23:46] <electrokitty> Yeah, that's what we normally use
[21:25:02] <LordKalma> wonder if I have one of those at work 
[21:25:56] <patchvonbraun[m]> electrokitty: Different USRP motherboard+daughterboard combinations have different behavior at power-up, etc. So, it's always prudent to have an attenuator in-line when doing loopback cables.
[21:26:06] *** Quits: Revan (~Revan@d118-75-189-78.col.wideopenwest.com) (Quit: Client closed)
[21:26:42] <electrokitty> Yeah, that's true
[21:27:26] <LordKalma> I've ordered some dummy loads to keep everything plugged also
[21:27:31] <LordKalma> habits from the lab
[21:27:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> The TX gain setting is an attenuator in the RF path, usually just before the RFPA on the output.  Similarly, on the RX path, the RX gain is set with an attenuator, usually right after the 1st LNA stage.  Which means that no amount of RX gain setting can protect you from that 1st LNA stage either being dfirven into non-linearity, or even damaged.    
[21:28:23] <patchvonbraun[m]> On platforms that use a mixed-signal RFFE chip, like the B2xx, E3xx, and N31x series, the story is more complicated, with gain being distributed throughout the chip.
[21:30:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> Basically, ALWAYS treat the RF input as if it were a precious princess.  This is true with pretty-much ALL modern receivers that are designed to be fairly sensitive (MDS below about -120dBm or so).  The GaAs HEMTs that are used as the first gain stage are fairly fragile, and while you can (and Ettus DOES) put in things like TVS diodes "in front", they cannot provide guaranteed protection against laboratory "ooops".
[21:30:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> Further any protection you put in front of a low-noise amplifier will negatively impact its noise figure.  So, it's a trade-off.
[21:30:34] <LordKalma> yap
[21:30:36] <LordKalma> indeed
[21:31:09] <LordKalma> recently I've been realizing I'm a fucking static magnet
[21:31:33] <LordKalma> dunno why, but I'm always getting shocks. go to the fridge, that's a shock, go open a cabinet with a metal handle, that's a shock
[21:31:41] <LordKalma> ffs and it hurts haha
[21:31:49] <LordKalma> so I'm so scared of messing with equiment now haha
[21:31:58] <LordKalma> I'm always wearing a static bracelet at work
[21:32:58] <Yamakaja[m]> Ohh, i had that in an office at one of my previous workplaces. They had a carpet that charged you up after just taking a few steps. At some point i developed a fear of touching metal because i'd always get a shock ...
[21:33:58] <LordKalma> for me it's mostly at home, except for some footwear that i've noticed exacerbates the problem elsewhere 
[21:34:13] <LordKalma> at work it's an epoxy floor, as usual in labs 
[21:34:31] <LordKalma> or whatever that rubberish thing is
[21:36:23] <LordKalma> aand the workbenches have grounded mats on them, so just by resting the wrists when using the computer I guess I'm discharged
[21:37:08] <electrokitty> LordKalma: ours is exactly the same, I'm pretty much used to it now and keep touching grounded stuff with the palm of my hand to discharge
[21:37:24] <electrokitty> Oddly, I've noticed it seems to be worse in the winter months
[21:37:32] <electrokitty> Something to do with humidity, maybe?
[21:37:36] <LordKalma> perhaps
[21:37:42] <Yamakaja[m]> Yes, the air tends to be drying in the winter

[21:37:51] <LordKalma> not here
[21:37:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> I worked in a static-controlled lab for about 9 months once.  Anti-static labcoat.  Wrist strap, etc, etc.
[21:38:57] <LordKalma> haha I worked in a full ISO7 cleanroom for like 4 hours and found the experience very tiring haha 
[21:41:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> We had these chip thermal-cycler machines that we used for testing in that lab.  They were surplus from Intel.  They used the lab compressed air source.  Which kept dumping oil all over our parts.  Despite having purchased a compressed-air system that was designed for clean-room use, it kept farking up and dumping oil.  When I left, they STILL hadn't gotten that resolved.
[21:41:52] <LordKalma> haha in my experience cleanrooms are sometimes surprisingly too much of a facade sometimes

[21:42:41] <patchvonbraun[m]> We had a BUNCH of chip-grade clean-rooms at Nortel.  We, you know, actually made chips :)

[21:43:05] <LordKalma> but on those the machines and humans are separated, aren't they?
[21:44:20] <electrokitty> Modern silicon fabrication has such tight tolerances on everything it's actually ridiculous
[21:44:35] <LordKalma> well
[21:44:43] <LordKalma> consider blue has a havelength of 400nm ish
[21:44:54] <LordKalma> and silicon manufacturing is 100x more precise
[21:45:11] <electrokitty> I remember one story about a plant that noticed higher than expected failure rate for certain chips produced after a certain date, even though the manufacturering process hadn't changed at all
[21:45:52] <electrokitty> After months of head scratching, they tied it down to a mine upstream from them which was dumping tailings in the river that contained a higher level of radioactivity, and that was negatively affecting the Si
[21:45:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> Generally, except for the research machines.    My friend designed (and patented) a fab process for GaAs stuff while he was an *intern* at Nortel, and then Nortel went on to build a $1M machine based on that.  He went on to become R&D manager at a company called Microlink Devices in Chicago.

[21:50:37] <LordKalma> the research at my old uni was mostly material science, not silicon manufacturing

[21:56:50] <electrokitty> I have wondered why everyone is still using EUV rather than say, X-rays or ion beams but it's not really my field so I'm sure there's a good reason
[21:57:19] <LordKalma> you need photosensitive material for those frequencies
[21:57:41] <LunaLovegood> I have a bunch of "ZMQ SUB Source" feeding into a "Polyphase Synthesizer", and I'd like to keep having output when some inputs are missing.

[22:04:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> For a multi-input block, GR won't schedule the work function until there's input available for all of the inputs.

[23:50:49] <DerekKozel[m]> LunaLovegood: I don't believe there's anything specifically intended for padding data like that. The need certainly exists, but the exact desired behavior is usually really dependent on the exact setup.
[23:53:24] <DerekKozel[m]> Such as for the add block, when input only exists on one of two channels and 100k samples are requested at the output, should the block pass all 100k samples from one channel and assume zeros on the other input? If input arrived just after on the second port it would be 100k samples behind now. If timing isn't critical that's not bad, but that could be quite a long delay depending on sample rate. And if one input was producing 50% the
[23:53:24] <DerekKozel[m]> data of the other it could easily get into a situation of being backed up if the 100% input is just beating it to produce often enough.

[23:54:10] <DerekKozel[m]> The add chould try and produce just small amounts on each call, but then it becomes a throughput bottleneck.
[23:55:10] <DerekKozel[m]> There are tutorials on authoring blocks which are pretty good and depending on your sample rate you could do it in Python if that's more comfortable than C++.
