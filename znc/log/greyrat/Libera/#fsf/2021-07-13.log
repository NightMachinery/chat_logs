[07:09:49] <monkwitdafunk> have you ever donated to the FSF bugweiser?
[07:10:06] <bugweiser> long long ago
[07:10:47] <monkwitdafunk> i found an artist on bandcamp.com found with the defective by design campaign who makes music with 2 freedoms
[07:11:11] <monkwitdafunk> i am sure i can use the artists audio for videography
[07:12:46] <bugweiser> great, I guess ?
[07:13:40] <monkwitdafunk> well... i am not sure which video editing software has an import feature if i plug my camcorder's built-in usb
[07:14:06] <monkwitdafunk> i have the sony hdr-405
[07:15:00] <monkwitdafunk> in the members only forums, another member gave this really cool web community of scanning technology using cameras
[07:15:33] <monkwitdafunk> i have paper work that i have to digitize
[07:15:47] <bugweiser> I assume sony has *some* software to export the video to your hard-disk. From there i'd assume any video editing tool can open the file (if the format is supported).
[07:16:06] <monkwitdafunk> yes! that is right. playmemories home
[07:16:21] <monkwitdafunk> it is not within the GNU directory

[13:47:37] <bugweiser> what about the 'as they wish' part? Wouldn't it otherwise be: `you can use them *or not*`  (weakly phrased, but I hope it gets the question across...)
[13:51:20] <jmd> bugweiser: I'm not a lawyer, but if one hires (say) a boat for a week, you can use it as you wish.  But the company might well be unhappy if it comes back painted purple and a bunch of portholes down the side which weren't there when it was given to you.
[13:52:33] <bugweiser> I don't have any intent on returning it though... ;P  But I think I get what you are trying to explain (and thanks for that).

[20:56:17] <kompowiec> anyone know book Dale Carnegie - How to Win Friends and Influence People? Nevermind, if you've never read it, let me summarize it in one sentence: Never tell people what you want. always talk about what they want and show them how they can get it. for example, you don't want your children to smoke, don't preach to them, and don't talk about what you want. Explain to them that cigarettes can exclude them from the basketball team or 
[20:56:17] <kompowiec> prevent them from winning the hundredth in the sprint. Is this what exactly is missing from the FSF movement?
