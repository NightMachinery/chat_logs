[07:18:07] <jacobk> Is there a free Microsoft Teams app that doesn't rely on the dial-in feature? I think the answer is no but I wanted to ask here since software like that can be hard to find sometimes.
[07:19:33] <DiffieHellman> No, there are superior video chat applications already, why would one write one trapped into m$ teams?
[07:21:20] <jacobk> I have a college class in which it seems my grade will decrease by 7.5% if I am unable to share my webcam stream with the class, and it's not possible to do video using the dial-in option.
[07:22:00] <jacobk> So, the reason would be similar to the reason for Invidious, I guess.

[07:22:14] <DiffieHellman> Just get the class to join Jitsi or whatever?
[07:23:21] <jacobk> Hm, maybe, but, that seems like a lot to ask
[07:23:31] <DiffieHellman> It's not a lot to ask for.
[07:23:49] <DiffieHellman> They're asking a lot from you if they expect you to throw away your freedom like that.
[07:24:38] <DiffieHellman> You can get the online link ready before and send it to everyone, as it runs in a web browser.

[07:26:39] <jacobk> I'd be asking the teacher to trust a program they've never heard of before, and I'd be asking other students to run yet another videochat application (this would be for multiple sessions).
[07:26:41] <jacobk> Hm, maybe, but, that seems like a lot to ask
[07:26:57] <jacobk> (oops, I resent a message)
[07:27:11] <jacobk> I meant to say: But, there's no harm in asking, I guess.
[07:27:22] <jacobk> So, I'll try it and see what happens
[07:27:41] <DiffieHellman> They love to trust programs that they're not even allowed to see the source of, so it shouldn't be that hard.

[07:30:19] <jacobk> I think Microsoft made a deal with the university or something? So, I think most people see it as more "legitimate" than other apps.
[07:31:07] <DiffieHellman> Of course, but any person capible of critical thinking can tell that with deals with m$, you lose.
[07:31:51] <jacobk> I don't think it's *that* obvious
[07:32:26] <DiffieHellman> Most people don't seem to be able to think critically, so it's not that obvious, yes

[07:33:24] <DiffieHellman> Blind faith in any business is just stupidity.
[07:34:01] <jacobk> Honestly even I have difficulty seeing a reason to avoid MS Teams other than freedom and privacy, and IIRC Jitsi doesn't really address the privacy issue in a verifiable way (I could be very wrong about this though).
[07:35:43] <DiffieHellman> It doesn't really, but jitsi at least appears to have libre JavaScript
[07:36:45] <jacobk> Yes, so I guess it actually *does* address the issue of privacy in the case of the MS Teams JS collecting more information than necessary, which is entirely possible.
[07:42:17] <jacobk> Thanks for the information and encouragement!

[16:39:20] <Andrew> Seems to be the case
[16:39:27] <DiffieHellman> 3>The kernel of Darwin is XNU
[16:39:32] <irelativism> Darwin kernel is based on the DarwinOS yes
[16:39:41] <labrador> Kernel type	Hybrid (XNU)
[16:39:45] <DiffieHellman> So there's no need to slap on `kernel` after XNU, as XNU is only a kernel.
[16:39:45] <Andrew> It 's weird then that uname says Darwin on macs
[16:39:46] <irelativism> it has evolved from it
[16:39:52] <labrador> Yeah Andrew its XNU

[16:41:20] <labrador> The only copylefted kernel is linux
[16:41:26] <labrador> That works
[16:41:27] <Andrew> Sadly, you can't just relicense e.g. OpenBSD under the AGPL or something
[16:41:29] <Whistler> the APSL is a copyleft license.  The issue is many important drivers used by macos are not released
[16:41:56] <Andrew> Anyways, apple doesn't even talk about 'Open source'
[16:42:07] <Andrew> though apple has one good contribution: CUPS

[19:24:12] <ggoes> ewwegweg: i think bandali, jxself and me did a good job of explaining why here https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2021-06/msg00005.html
[19:24:12] <isf> a good one
[19:24:17] <isf> for big images
[19:24:40] <Andrew> oftc requires some reCaptcha that I can't fill out
[19:24:46] <ggoes> yeah ^
[19:24:51] <labrador> yeah hcaptcha

[19:25:06] <Andrew> how come
[19:25:06] <ggoes> we also be want to be where everyone else is
[19:25:15] <ggoes> and the overwhelming majority of the libre software community has chosen libera

[19:25:36] <jxself> Yes it's quite nice to be able to go from one channel to another on the same IRC network and visit with other projects.
[19:25:39] <ewwegweg> ggoes but its not anon do you know?
[19:25:54] <Andrew> ewwegweg: so what?
[19:25:57] <isf> be anon isnt a right,
[19:26:09] <ewwegweg> firstly we dont use tor with irc
[19:26:15] <isf> if you want be anon you can connect  in other server with Tor
[19:26:27] <Andrew> ewwegweg: you can be anon with a bunch of tors then vpns
[19:26:48] <ewwegweg> vpn is not good :D 
[19:26:59] <Andrew> ewwegweg: why
[19:27:09] <Noisytoot> labrador: It's not really fine. Registering requires either proprietary software or complaining in #oftc about the nonfree software and asking them to manually verify your account
[19:27:12] <ewwegweg> tor better than vpn
[19:27:28] <isf> here isnt good for anon
[19:27:31] <ggoes> i don't really know that anonymity is all that conducive to the type of discussions you would have on irc. in a perfect world they'd be mostly about helping out different projects / submitting patches and documentation, etc., where perfect anonymity isn't really desirable
[19:27:38] <Andrew> thou may connect to vpns through tor?
[19:27:43] <labrador> yea?
[19:27:47] <labrador> why not
[19:27:58] <labrador> im not encouraging it tho
[19:28:01] <labrador> at all
[19:28:08] <Noisytoot> ewwegweg: It is possible to register anonymously (like via Matrix), but it's more difficult (which prevents spambots from abusing Tor)
[19:28:12] <labrador> its a BAD IDEA
[19:28:32] <ewwegweg> already libera not allow tor(only sasl)
[19:28:52] <Andrew> ewwegweg: You can use the mailing lists with disposable emails (not recommended)
[19:29:31] <ewwegweg> labrador always tor is better than all vpn
[19:29:43] <ewwegweg> even matrix better libera
[19:30:01] <Andrew> ewwegweg: tor -> vpn -> libera
[19:30:15] <jxself> This is the Free Software Foundation, though, not the Anonymous Software Foundation.
[19:30:47] <ggoes> and 99% of users who would join a matrix room we might set up would have to run nonfree software in the process, since most people are on matrix.org, which requires a captcha
[19:30:55] <ggoes> on registration and every new login
[19:30:58] <Andrew> quick query: non-SaaSS free translation program?
[19:30:58] <ewwegweg> jxself oh okay
[19:31:12] <ggoes> Andrew: i think gnu is looking into one called argos translate -- something like that
[19:31:49] <Andrew> thx
[19:31:56] <kompowiec> weird i never saw captcha on matrix.org, maybe i have account for too long.
[19:31:58] <jxself> That doesn't mean anonymity isn't important. But if there is a choice to make between the two, the one that's on-mission seems more appropriate. If OFTC requires non-free software in registering a nick that should automatically disqualify it.
[19:32:08] <ewwegweg> ggoes its only captcha but on the libera ip adresses
[19:32:33] <Andrew> ewwegweg: that's better than recaptchas
[19:32:37] <ggoes> ewwegweg: only requiring nonfree software *some* of the time is not a great quality
[19:32:54] <ggoes> when a place to chat is available that requires it none of the time
[19:33:02] <GNUHacker> Andrew: oftc dont require any captcha
[19:33:05] <kompowiec> recaptcha still works without Javascript iirc
[19:33:12] <GNUHacker> is a irc network not a website
[19:33:21] <Andrew> GNUHacker: that's what i saw when i tried registering a nick
[19:33:31] <GNUHacker> i dont need visit the oftc website to use oftc

[20:01:34] <jess> fwiw i think matrix is a good choice for some communities, though you really do have to run your own homeserver to have adequate community management
[20:01:38] <jess> which is a bit too much work for some people
[20:01:56] <Andrew> xmpp servers are easier to run
[20:02:03] <Andrew> still harder than irc servers
[20:02:04] <jess> not easier to mitigate abuse on though
[20:02:06] <jess> nightmare for that
[20:02:14] <Andrew> yeah
[20:02:46] <jess> i feel like libera.chat is chosen by projects with open source moral imperatives that really don't want to run their own chat infrastructure. it's a *reasonable* tradeoff for most people
[20:03:13] <jess> IRC is simple enough and established enough for a small team to run fairly large infrastructure for free in their hobby time and that means projects can *just use it*
[20:03:21] <ggoes> yeah, that is nice

[20:14:23] <kompowiec> in other words, what I mean is that words can build our approach to a fact.
[20:14:47] <jxself> That kind of works in English too but "i try" could also mean with a conviction. Depending on context.

[22:28:38] <ggoes> so, if you don't know, the freedom laddder is a campaign we're working on to produce introductory free software materials. the main shortcoming with the ones we know about and that you probably know about as well are that they encourage people to "rest content" once they've gotten gnu/linux working at all, and not push for higher levels of freedom

[22:35:58] <elshid_> Actually, I think that it was at school. When I went to secondary school (year 5 - 12), we had Ubuntu on our school-computers (some Laptops and the computers of the administative personal had Windows XP, though).
[22:36:03] <devinu> My story:
[22:36:03] <devinu> * Years ago, I was conducting testing at a school as part of my job.
[22:36:03] <devinu> * In short, I had to use my computer to conduct the test. Every day, I was using my computer (MacBook Pro at the time). I became frustrated with what seemed like arbitrary restrictions on my computer. I asked, "Why is my computer telling *me* what to do?" That is when I began a search during my lunch breaks, between testing, and found fsf.org, gnu.org, and discovered free software.
[22:36:03] <devinu> * I installed GNU/Linux onto that laptop and the rest is history. :)
[22:36:17] <ggoes> oh that's cool
[22:36:17] <avane> alright cheers bandali, I'm considering setting it up. just that I have rather constrained hardware (384MB memory) and Gitea wasn't exactly the most lightweight thing
[22:36:43] <devinu> elshid_: that is great that you had Ubuntu on your school computers!
[22:36:52] <bandali> avane, cheers :) yeah that should be plenty, especially for a personal/smallish instance
[22:36:57] <constcl> Remember any specific restriction, devinu?
[22:36:59] <zleap> i joined the devon and cornwall lug back in 1999
[22:37:04] <kompowiec> devinu, i jelaous. For me, only in junior high school, there was one teacher with what linux on kde that had to be deleted because the windows license could not be wasted or something.
[22:37:18] <Y_Plentyn> My story:
[22:37:47] <kompowiec> Polish goverment schools suffer from technophobia and most may still have windows xp
[22:37:47] <ggoes> one of my more eccentric moments of fs activism was wrapping gnu/linux live distros around my campus, wrapped in special sleeves i made of eben moglen's dotcommunist manifesto ha

[22:38:43] <zleap> elshid_,  any idea why sometimes it needs people who know how to maintain the system
[22:39:00] <Y_Plentyn> I was starting studying computer science, and helping out in the students council. the machine they used had Sinix running, I was hooked into Unix soon. I entered the more active side of free software while hacking p2c to work on this machine.
[22:39:41] <kompowiec> >  "Why is my computer telling *me* what to do?" 
[22:39:41] <zleap> i got linux 1.0.9 on a cover cd, i liked it, as when using cp it allowed me to rename files
[22:39:42] <kompowiec> funny because my trigger was the bad quality of nonfree software and the fact that they crash more often than free software.

[22:40:06] <devinu> constcl: many restrictions, but the biggest thing was, it was the time when Apple required you to pay for an upgrade, which I did not want to do at the time. I was recording stuff on my iPhone (yes, I was a very obedient apple user at the time), and I upgraded my OS on the iPhone, and all of a sudden I could no longer just copy audio recordings from my iPhone to MacOS.

[22:40:34] <zoe> My first program was probably VLC, not because I knew what free software was, but it was advised to me as a player that would play almost anything and could record while playing as well, which was practical for my studies at that time. It was emphasized that there was something *different* (as in better ethically) about it. That didn't mean a lot to me, until i learned more about copyleft and other concepts related to free software not
[22:40:34] <zoe> long after.

[22:47:10] <Kaiod> Hello guys!
[22:47:11] <devinu> We are sharing our "free software" stories now. Please share, if you are able!
[22:47:22] <kompowiec> oh gosh, how do i remid things from 16 years ago :P
[22:47:25] <irelativism> Y_Plentyn: after checking this movie is about scifi not the OS uhh...

[22:48:15] <Kaiod> devinu: First time I've seen you, nice to meet you!
[22:48:25] <Y_Plentyn> irelativism: correct. but the os is named after it
[22:48:36] <ggoes> hey Kaiod 
[22:48:44] <ggoes> thanks for fixing our mistake on the wiki last night haha
[22:48:50] <irelativism> is there any documentary about the operating system?
[22:48:59] <Kaiod> You talked about stories, I have a great one about mine regarding education, learning and free software.
[22:48:59] <irelativism> I would like to understand more about it
[22:49:00] <devinu> Kaiod: You might know me by another handle :p
[22:49:31] <devinu> I just started as the newly hired FSF Outreach and Communications Coordinator, and this is my handle for FSF
[22:49:36] <ggoes> woooo
[22:49:38] * GNUHacker is bored
[22:49:52] <Y_Plentyn> irelativism - that would interest me, too
[22:50:30] <zleap> documentation is good
[22:50:33] <Kaiod> ggoes: I'm looking into how I can collaborate more, including sending out later in the mailing list about the need to watch out for vandalism on the wiki, especially during LibrePlanet 2022.
[22:51:26] <Kaiod> devinu: Congratulations, I am very happy for you! I hope you do a good job and enjoy it from there!
[22:51:32] <devinu> Kaiod: education, learning, and fs is certainly appealing to us. Please share!
[22:51:32] <elshid_> I would like to share an anecdote of my girlfriend. She never started using most proprietary software in the first place. When she was younger, her father installed Linux Mint on her laptop, her smartphone runs on Replicant. She uses it not because of the freedom aspect, but just because this is what she is used to. She hates the Interface of Microsoft Windows and that much non-free software is not so much configurable. What I want to 
[22:51:32] <elshid_> say is that some people do not need to climb up, because they never went into the non-free world anyway.
[22:51:53] <ggoes> good point

[22:52:28] <zoe> That is awesome, and rare though elshid_ 
[22:52:30] <zleap> in general
[22:53:11] <devinu> elshid_: that is a good story
[22:53:20] <Kaiod> devinu: Would you rather I write on the wiki or send it here?
[22:53:39] <ggoes> Kaiod: maybe the complete story at https://my.fsf.org/your-free-software-story ; but the highlights here
[22:53:40] <irelativism> initial exchange is better to be here
[22:53:48] <irelativism> so arguments can be refuted etc
[22:54:01] <irelativism> after that I would suggest using the wiki yes
[22:54:28] <irelativism> discourse is allways good though to understand the holes in our beleievs :)
[22:54:30] <devinu> My son, who is 4.5, is using an xo laptop right now. When he grows up, he will probably be like "what is this?" It is fun. I have made simple programs (via TurtleArt) for him to run.
[22:54:49] <Kaiod> ggoes: Okay, I'm just finishing signing some documents and I'll tell you all about it! I even sent you an email ggoes
[22:55:07] <bandali> devinu, nice :)
[22:55:22] <ggoes> i still haven't seen an XO in person
[22:55:24] <ggoes> or at least a working one
[22:55:40] <irelativism> yeah that will show very usefull for your son
[22:55:44] <irelativism> I would say
[22:55:52] <zleap> devinu, early exposure is good,  then kids start school and end up using propriatary software in some cases
[22:55:54] <zoe> maybe you can borrow devinu's for a bit ggoes :)
[22:56:02] <devinu> ggoes: you haven't lived, you haven't lived :)
[22:56:17] <bandali> ggoes, to your earlier point, it would seem that nonfree firmware is essentially the biggest remaining gap/obstacle for a fully free computing experience today
[22:56:41] <bandali> not usually the first step of the latter by any stretch tho, of course
[22:56:45] <bandali> s/latter/ladder/
[22:56:56] <zleap> bandali, yes +1 to that
[22:57:23] <irelativism> does anyone has more info in plan 9
[22:57:32] <irelativism> in what way is decentalized 
[22:57:33] <devinu> Those XO laptops really traveled the world. I say many on my travels to Thailand for a conference. For whatever reason, not many landed, like, in the US, like, where much of the development was done... :/
[22:57:33] <ggoes> yeah bandali i'd agree
[22:57:35] <constcl> I would also point social media and software required by jobs and school
[22:57:45] <irelativism> is it decentralized through hardware etc
[22:57:52] <Rynn> Is non-free firmware inclusive of the TPM stuff that Intel/AMD cram in? Libre/coreboot seem to have been a bit slow to make progress on even the Intel side, with even less on the AMD side.
[22:57:57] <irelativism> would be some simple question I would have
[22:58:10] <zleap> constcl, yes that too
[22:58:16] <waitman> I finished filling out the form and the result message is that my 'submission has been received' so I think it is working. IF that's still a question.
[22:58:20] <ggoes> Rynn: not sure about others, but i include that when i say/think about "nonfree firmware"
[22:58:23] <zleap> so not peer pressure but school/employer pressure
[22:59:01] <zleap> peer pressure may apply to use of phones, and social media
[22:59:48] <constcl> I see so many people in my country glued to Facebook and Whatsapp
[22:59:57] <elshid_> Apropos firmware: We will get computers more and more free of that, as well. I am writing this from a Librem Laptop with much of the non-free stuff disabled. It still has some blobs, but with each update, they become fewer and fewer.
[23:00:20] <constcl> elshid_: cool
[23:00:29] <ggoes> yeah, there are some promising projects out there
[23:00:36] <Y_Plentyn> Rynn: the documentation of libreboot has some good explanations of the limitations and reasons behind them
[23:00:42] <waitman> What we need more of is open mobile devices and open VR devices
[23:00:51] <ggoes> mobile definitely
[23:01:06] <Noisytoot> Rynn: The newest AMD CPU that doesn't require PSP is newer than the newest Intel CPU that doesn't require ME
[23:01:07] <waitman> i'm not into VR but it seems like the future
[23:01:09] <zleap> waitman, i am going to write a command on the mobile stuff,  at some point (started making notes)
[23:01:18] <zleap> command = comment
[23:01:26] <constcl> So we need free software compatible VR
[23:01:29] <elshid_> Actually the stuff of Meta is also a trouble for me. I am using Instagram and WhatsApp, but I am gradually switching to Signal.
[23:01:37] <Noisytoot> We need free modem firmware
[23:01:39] <waitman> I think the RISC-V project is exciting in the mobile device world.
[23:01:41] <elshid_> constcl: +1
[23:02:03] <zleap> constcl, i think godot has just been given a big donation by Meta to develop vr or ar stuff
[23:02:41] <elshid_> Noisytoot: There are many people working on this!
[23:02:45] <waitman> open devices will bring open software
[23:03:15] <constcl> The problem is to convince hardware manufacturers...
[23:03:30] <devinu> The best we have right now are "Respects Your Freedom" certified products. https://ryf.fsf.org/
[23:03:32] <zleap> we just need people to know about it,  know where to learn how to develop software etc
[23:03:38] <Noisytoot> https://github.com/Biktorgj/pinephone_modem_sdk
[23:03:59] <elshid_> There are some companies that actually use the free firmware and open hardware as a selling point.
[23:04:20] <zleap> we should collate that info
[23:05:55] <waitman> I'm not an expert but it looks to me like the Chinese manufacturers will pounce on RISC-V products and the other companies will cave to compete on price. maybe?
[23:06:13] <Y_Plentyn> devinu: a next step there would be sponsoring/supporting projects building such certified products
[23:06:48] <Y_Plentyn> especially in cases were no good options are available
[23:07:00] <devinu> Y_Plentyn: certainly
[23:07:35] *** Joins: biblio (~biblio@user/biblio)
[23:07:37] <zleap> how important is the idea that people need to earn money to pay bills in this
[23:07:49] <Y_Plentyn> but to not sound like criticising - i _love_ ryf.fsf.org
[23:07:55] <zleap> so you can write apps for say iphone / android and make money 
[23:08:02] <devinu> This discussion of "share your story" reminds me of "For Want of a Printer" (Chapter 1 of https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/faif-2.0.pdf)
[23:09:13] <constcl> I think Android apps could have privacy respecting ads that are relevant for users
[23:09:39] <zleap> that means data collection
[23:09:47] <constcl> Sure?
[23:09:57] <zleap> then that opens up a whole can of worms with the gdpr in the Uk / EU
[23:10:06] <constcl> Trisquel has ads
[23:10:07] <zleap>  look at the google analytics ruling
[23:10:28] <constcl> But i mean ads that don't track users
[23:10:40] <devinu> Y_Plentyn: we are certainly receptive to "room for improvement". Our overarching goal is to achieve software freedom.

[23:12:15] <jacobk> It might be possible to have targeted ads without data collection, if all the targeting was done locally, on the users machine. But, then I guess you'd have to download *all* the ads in advance.
[23:12:19] <devinu> F-droid usually has some way to pay the developers, which is nice.
[23:12:41] <zleap> is f-droid cross platform, as in does it work on more than 1 mobile OS 
[23:12:50] <devinu> And f-droid does give you a good list of "anti-features".
[23:13:00] <Y_Plentyn> I usually prefer paying money to seeing ads

[23:15:21] <Y_Plentyn> there was the free software bazaar 20 years ag, maybe it could have a rerun

[23:19:32] <elshid_> Well, actually the EU wants to found "open source software" in Europe.
[23:19:57] <devinu> FWIW, I purchased a RYF laptop a few years back. I still have and use it to this very day. Also, I am happy to share the software, with anyone who wants it. :)
[23:21:24] <zleap> not just financial donations, perhaps the fsf could collect hardware that is being replaced, install free software and make it available to people working on free software projects
[23:21:51] <devinu> Any more "free software stories"? We are planning to end in ten minutes or so ( ggoes, please correct me if I am mistaken)
[23:21:53] <zleap> i think projects like freegeek do that and penquin corps

[23:22:53] <elshid_> Could we make a "thank you"-session, where we thank the developers of our favourite free software packages?

[23:24:40] <zleap> which is what people want
[23:25:18] <zleap> looking at the page, I think for me non free firmware is  more of a frustration as it is a barrier to running a fully free OS
[23:25:44] <jacobk> I think the first free software program I used was Tux Paint (on Windows PCs) in elementary school, but I didn't know what free software was until 2020 when I installed Hyperbola (and then later switched to Trisquel). I was lucky to accidentally buy a laptop compatible with free software years before I knew what free software was, so nonfree firmware was never an issue for me.
[23:25:49] <ggoes> 16:30 est, yes, so ~90 mins
[23:26:10] <ggoes> for as much as people talk about it i've never tried tux paint haha
[23:26:14] <ggoes> windows -> hyperbola is a nice jump
[23:26:40] <jacobk> hehe
[23:26:56] <zleap> i think there is a consensus in some cases happened upon free software
[23:27:10] <elshid_> I would like to thank the developers of the GNU project, especially the ones of the GNU Compiler Collection, GNU R and GNU nano.
[23:27:19] <zleap> +1
[23:27:25] <jacobk> I saw "simplicity-focused" and thought that sounded good, but setting it (Hyperbola) up was not simple in my opinion lol
[23:27:25] <zleap> nano is a lifesaver
[23:27:51] <zleap> esp when debian fails and I need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list to enable a repository to install other software
[23:27:58] <GNUHacker> why fsf send me all the mails in html? i like plain text :/
[23:28:20] <devinu> GNUHacker: I think you can set a preference
[23:28:24] <Noisytoot> GNUHacker: I think either there's an option to send them in plain text or they're multipart/alternative emails
[23:28:29] <GNUHacker> how? devinu 
[23:28:32] <devinu> ggoes: isn't that correct?
[23:28:40] <jxself> Since we seem to be on that topic, this is I learned about free software: https://jxself.org/how-i-learned.shtml
[23:28:47] <zoe> Yeah we send both in plaintext and html devinu GNUHacker 
[23:29:00] <elshid_> Zleap: Absolutely. Nano runs nearly everywhere, no matter how bad things are. And it is pretty customizable with the nanorc-files.
[23:29:02] <waitman> not sure i'd say 'debian fails' in my opinion, but like there's a broadcom chip in the computer and the user doesn't want to change it. 
[23:29:03] <ggoes> i think the preference is based on your client
[23:29:22] <bandali> jxself, nice, thanks fo rsharing :)
[23:29:27] <ggoes> yeah, i need to read that
[23:29:37] <zleap> waitman, well i tried to install debian 11 on my old netbooks and it seems to not like the networking stuff
[23:29:40] <zleap> deb 10 is fine
[23:29:49] <Noisytoot> debian 11 works fine on my old netbook
[23:29:53] <zleap> upgrading 10 to 11 breaks something,
[23:30:08] <zleap> this is my HP110 
[23:30:25] <ggoes> something always breaks when i update my guix system, but that's part of the fun : )

[23:31:33] <waitman> like change the wifi card and it's like 'oops we cannot boot with that sorry'

[23:31:59] <Noisytoot> GNUHacker: I'm not promoting it and Debian is fully free if I don't use contrib or non-free (which I don't)
[23:32:02] <devinu> jxself: thank you for your link. Very nice!
[23:32:05] <waitman> so i have this list in my head, and it's like "i cannot boot hp sorry"
[23:32:20] <Noisytoot> zleap: Debian main is free but not FSDG-compliant because non-free and contrib exist.
[23:32:25] <ggoes> yep
[23:32:29] <zleap> ok
[23:32:35] <GNUHacker> if you dont use debian non-free software, debian is free, ok
[23:32:55] <zleap> thing is I need stuff like zoom for some meetings I attend
[23:32:57] <ggoes> that just can be a little misleading / complex / confusing, so it's easier to recommend trisquel
[23:33:03] <ggoes> which we know is okay
[23:33:05] <zleap> but that is in a snap container
[23:33:36] <devinu> zleap: do they require you to connect via the desktop client or can you call in?

[23:33:56] <devinu> no need to share, if you don't want to
[23:34:10] <ggoes> yeah, the fsf will call into meetings with our office phones if we have to attend one
[23:34:14] <zleap> devinu, for the scismic webinars,  i can use the web thibg, but that failed at yesterdays webinbar so I grabbed the id and used he client inside a snap
[23:34:14] <tfisgnag> Sorry for arriving so late. I was filling the form. I would like to read a copy of what was said here since the meeting began. Is that possible?

[23:36:27] <ggoes> afaik, yes
[23:36:30] <zleap> yeah
[23:36:39] <zleap>  it messed up i was unable to see the slides

[23:37:42] <zleap> tfisgnag, not sure
[23:37:44] <waitman> yes it's annoying when people ask you to join their zoom meeting or whatever
[23:37:49] <jacobk> With dial-in you can't ever see the slides also :P
[23:38:20] <zleap> at least if we here host a meeting we can send people bbb or jitsi links

[23:39:02] <ggoes> haha yeah
[23:39:45] <zleap> you need to send them a replacement that looks nice and polished such as bbb
[23:39:55] <devinu> FWIW, https://meet.fsf.org/ is a benefit of being an associate member, so you could host your own meetings via FSF's Jitsi instance.
[23:40:02] <jxself> --Sent from my PDP-10 mainframe in the basement running the Incompatible Timesharing System
[23:40:15] <zleap> that way they see that free / open source software can in many cases look professional, look nice and they may even consider switching
[23:40:29] <elshid_> Or you can also hist your own.
[23:40:30] <jacobk> tfisgnag: I have the chat history saved locally, but I'm not sure if there are rules about sharing it? I guess some people might not want their statements here to be public (though, that's trusting all 400+ users not to share it lol).

[23:42:07] <jacobk> (IIRC there were some rules about sharing messages in the member forum, though I understand that's a bit different as you have to pay to enter)

[23:51:33] <jxself> I suppose it depends on if that person has read the announcement.
[23:51:38] <elshid_> Libreplanet!
[23:51:49] <zleap> devinu, i was trying to suggest why the login may not be working
[23:52:00] <waitman> right i can see my account info so i'm logged in, when i go to meet.fsf.org i get a generic apache 401 error document
[23:52:26] <waitman> like the 401 error doc that ships with apache

[23:53:07] <jxself> I am also getting 401
[23:53:13] <jxself> I guess it fell over and died.
[23:53:42] <jxself> The sysadmin probably know. I'm imagining alarm beeping and lights flashing.
[23:53:53] <ggoes> i put out the tech team signal
[23:53:56] <waitman> maybe they upgraded the jvm. there's a bug in jitsi i found and it's a small change to get it to work with modern jvm's
[23:53:59] <ggoes> which is like the bat signal, but a wildebeest
[23:54:02] <jxself> THe sysadmins slide down a pole and exclaim "To the GNUmobile!" as the hop in and drive off.

[23:55:47] <waitman> thanks that jitsi.member.fsf.org link works
[23:56:17] <zleap> so who develops jit.si ?
[23:56:37] <tfisgnag> jacobk: I am receiving your message. I am somewhat concerned because I only wanted to read the last hour and you are sending the content of two hours. Won't that jeopardize the whole transmission?
[23:57:16] <zleap> the text file should not be that big for 2 hours
[23:57:56] <zleap> but the full 2 hours is better if there is something that in hour 2 is related to hour 1 and would be out of context
[23:58:21] <zleap> if that makes sense
[23:58:53] <elshid_> jitsi is a trademark of 8x8, at least according to their website. So I assume that they are developing it.
[23:58:59] <Noisytoot> They are.
