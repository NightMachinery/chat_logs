[00:00:16] <andrewrk> davidfetter_work, any computer science topic is on topic here :)
[00:00:23] <davidfetter_work> thanks!
[00:01:32] <davidfetter_work> ikskuh, how big a grammar are we talking about? I'm asking because, well... https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/parser/gram.y
[00:02:10] <davidfetter_work> SQL all by itself is hucking fuge, and that doesn't even count the parts that can only be established by looking in the catalog, of which there are many
[00:03:03] <ikskuh> impressive
[00:03:12] <ikskuh> in my case: several programming languages
[00:04:14] <ifreund> pretty much all major programming language implementations use a hand written recursive descent parser
[00:04:47] <ifreund> I don't think anyone wants to write a parser for a 17k line grammar though...
[00:04:52] * davidfetter_work wonders whether SQL counts as a "major programming language"
[00:05:31] <ifreund> i was excluding it from that statement :D
[00:06:14] * davidfetter_work studied chemistry & applied math in school, so missed out on much of the formalism he'd have picked up with a CS degree
[00:06:31] <andrewrk> In 1.5 hours I'll do a self-hosted compiler stream: catching up the C backend to the LLVM backend. https://www.twitch.tv/andrewrok/
[00:07:45] <ifreund> davidfetter_work: you might be interested in this blog post and lobsters comment section: https://lobste.rs/s/9pcqys/which_parsing_approach

[07:42:19] <discipulus> Question regarding top-level... resolve/resolving/resolution means to assert identifiers are declared and used. And refer/reference means to use an identifier in an expression or statement. Right?
[07:45:40] <andrewrk> jrl, if you don't mind- let me know how it goes. it's good to know that ZSF wasn't listed. if you don't mind, what company is that?
[07:46:23] <andrewrk> discipulus, in what context? are you reading some source code or documentation?
[07:48:17] *** Joins: davidfetter_work (~davidfett@c-73-252-148-184.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[07:49:40] <discipulus> andrewrk I'm writing documentation for containers. I want to define those terms for readers to understand.
[07:50:17] <andrewrk> oh btw I'd like to rename "container" to "aggregate"
[07:50:36] <discipulus> Ah! I was wondering about that. 
[07:50:49] <andrewrk> because "container" is ambiguous with data structures
[07:51:08] <discipulus> I had a feeling that was going to be renamed based on an issue I read
[07:51:28] <discipulus> My old but still untouched draft is at https://paulespinosa.github.io/zig-langref/explain-zig-test-and-containers-02.html#Containers
[07:52:47] <discipulus> I thought containers would be a type of aggregate
[07:53:30] *** Quits: davidfetter_work (~davidfett@c-73-252-148-184.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[07:53:42] <discipulus> I was guessing that Aggregates are arrays, containers, and can't remember what else... While Containers are struct, union, enum, opaque.
[07:55:29] <andrewrk> the property that struct, union, enum, and opaque share is that they create a namespace
[07:55:51] <andrewrk> maybe they can be called "namespace declarations" ?
[07:56:28] <discipulus> containers have "top-level" features as well
[07:56:59] <andrewrk> that's just namespaces
[07:57:23] <andrewrk> there is no "top-level" - each file is a struct
[07:57:25] <tsmanner> Nitpicking a bit, by the definition of aggregate, I would consider something like an array or tuple to be a container (they contain things) but not an aggregate. 
[07:57:44] <tsmanner> From Merriam Webster: Aggregate: formed by the collection of units or particles into a body, mass, or amount
[07:59:07] <discipulus> That's why I created the section to document the meaning of "top-level". Because there's lots of comments about "top-level" in discussions and the lang ref.
[08:00:22] <discipulus> I wrote that a "top-level" thing is a direct child of a container
[08:05:42] <andrewrk> yeah thanks for that
[08:05:44] <discipulus> Anyways, I'll go with any definitions given. I haven't been able to stay on top of this lately because I've been searching for a job and spending time preparing for interviews.
[08:06:01] <andrewrk> note that when I wrote "top-level", it *was* different than namespaces
[08:06:10] <andrewrk> but then it changed to be the same as being inside a struct
[08:06:34] <andrewrk> ah that sounds like a lot of work. I hope you get some great offers
[08:08:23] <discipulus> thanks. I enjoy helping with the documentation efforts. 
[08:10:03] <discipulus> I can start to change container to aggregate. Is there already efforts to make the terminology change in other places?

[08:14:41] <discipulus> It was #9646 where I saw aggregate types defined. I wasn't sure if the definitions there were meant for users though. It seems they were useful definitions to make for the sake of the proposed behavior.

[08:23:43] <discipulus> tsmanner: makes sense. I looked at other sources for guidance too. K&R C book tells us aggregate types are are arrays and structures. But that's C not Zig.

[18:08:52] <ifreund> andrewrk: I'm looking into reverting the std.os reorg that replaces e.g. os.MAP_SHARED with os.MAP.SHARED since you said you'd be ammenable to reverting that change before 0.9.0
[18:09:24] <ifreund> my current plan is to not actually `git revert` the commits but instead re implement the old API with the new file structure (which I think is better)
[18:10:15] <ifreund> are there any other parts in particular that you'd like to keep? I'm kind on the fence about the errno enum for example

[21:33:07] <ifreund> andrewrk: yeah, that would be great long term. I'm still in the stage of considering what the ideal is though at this point
[21:33:32] *** Joins: thing (~thing@user/thing)
[21:34:01] <andrewrk> do I understand correctly that the main downside to status quo is the names are non-standard?
[21:34:26] <haze> unnecessary friction imo
[21:35:07] <ifreund> andrewrk: I really liked the property of the old organization that I could read a name in a manpage and expect to find it at std.os.FOO_BAR
[21:35:33] <andrewrk> agreed that was a nice property
[21:35:57] <andrewrk> that property means eschewing enums for things that are enums
[21:36:26] <ifreund> such as errno? What do you thing of my proposal above?

[21:44:23] <andrewrk> ifreund, hmm so in your proposal we have Errno but then what about std.os.ENOMEM? do we additionally create a `pub const ENOMEM = Errno.ENOMEM;` for each item in the enum?
[21:45:03] <companion_cube> can't it be an enum, and you bring all the cases into scope?
[21:45:09] <companion_cube> </naive>
[21:45:28] <ifreund> andrewrk: ah yeah good point
[21:46:08] <companion_cube> does `usingnamespace Errno;` not work?
[21:46:31] <ifreund> companion_cube: you can write it, but it only brings decls in to the namespace, not fields
[21:46:45] <andrewrk> I think if we try to organize things into zig namespaces properly we should go all the way and chop off the E
[21:46:55] <andrewrk> or we should revert back to how it was, and translate these things as pub consts
[21:47:25] <ifreund> I think the everything is a pub const approach is much lower friction even if it does eschew a bit of type safety
[21:47:56] <ifreund> I think it's pretty much unambiguously better for the non-enum cases, so I'll focus on those for now and leave enums out of my current work
[21:48:32] <andrewrk> sounds good
[21:48:35] <ifreund> I'm not entirely sure how much benefit the enums provide in practice
[21:48:36] <andrewrk> sorry for the trouble
[21:48:50] <ifreund> no worries, I'm very happy with where the usingnamespace semantic landed :)
[21:49:08] <andrewrk> two steps forward, one step back, is still progress
[21:49:44] <ifreund> did you want to do the usingnamespace keyword rename before 0.9.0 by the way? If you pull the trigger and accept a new name I don't mind implementing it
[21:50:09] <andrewrk> mmm good question. I think that's something to aim for
