[01:05:38] <Gustavo6046> so I have a value between 0x00 and 0xFF which is the high byte (which I realized is the only one I actually care about) of a value from a cos lookup table. Values below 0x80 represent negative values (-1 through 0), and above 0x80 are positive values (0 through 1). I want to transform that into a value around a constant c_posx (here #$08) that is up to c_radius (here #6) away. So between c_posx -
[01:05:40] <Gustavo6046> c_radius and c_posx + c_radius.

[04:59:25] <n4dir> and, as said: hearsay
[04:59:36] <MrPockets> tomreyn, you want the lines closer to the end, or the top?
[04:59:58] <keir> MrPockets: closer the when the issue is happening
[05:00:08] <tomreyn> MrPockets: actually both, the top for a normal boot, the end for one which froze
[05:00:12] <MrPockets> oh look at that, a timestamp.
[05:00:14] <Guest67> I am wondering if it will make a difference in sound for me making video tutorials and editing. Kdenlive I had a problem where if I cut the video clips, the sound would make a weird loud static noise between clip cuts
[05:00:35] <tomreyn> MrPockets: journalctl --list-boots    lists the latest boots,   journalctl -b -3 -e    would go to the end of the log from 3 reboots ago
[05:00:43] <ayecee> Guest67: it won't
[05:00:47] <rascul> Guest67 theoretically you shouldn't have issues
[05:00:47] <n4dir> Guest67: then give it a try. Enough folks around trying it already.

[05:24:07] <hololeap> you could try using root=/dev/sd* for now. I could be wrong but I thought there needed to be some extra machinery outside the kernel to use root=UUID=
[05:24:29] <rascul> i think it's PARTUUID that needs help not UUID
[05:24:38] <katp32> yeah ^
[05:24:38] <rascul> but i'm drunk so i could be thinking incorrectly
[05:24:51] <katp32> I'm using root=UUID= with no initramfs on the system I'm typing on right now :)
[05:25:08] <hololeap> and also booting with an EFI stub?
[05:25:09] <MrPockets> I only posted the one link
[05:25:14] <katp32> yup
[05:25:23] <hololeap> fair enough. it's been a while since I did that.
[05:25:24] <tomreyn> i see
[05:25:38] <rascul> pretty sure booting with root=UUID= doesn't require uefi
[05:25:50] <katp32> the kernel panic output even tells me what the UUIDs of the partitions it detects are, so
[05:26:04] <rascul> it does require the kernel to know how to handle the filesystem
[05:26:22] <MrPockets> tomreyn, is this the excuse I need to just roll over and replce this 10+ year old desktop?
[05:26:24] <rascul> what is the panic output?
[05:27:03] <katp32> just a generic message saying the fs specified in root= doesn't exist, and listing the filesystems it *does* detect for convenience, which is helpful
[05:27:10] <tomreyn> MrPockets: it might be, though you could also try analyzing it more.
[05:27:36] <tomreyn> MrPockets: i guess it all depends on how deep your MrPockets are
[05:27:36] <MrPockets> In your opinion (this is a bit out of my league) is a BIOS update even worth the effort to reboot?
[05:27:43] <rascul> that message doesn't seem familiar to me, i would have to see it verbatim
[05:28:03] <shibboleth> anyone happen to have been wrought with some surprising luks+initramfs issues this week?
[05:28:41] <katp32> yeah, I don't recall the kernel printing out the filesystems it detects before, that's been a point of frustration in the past. maybe it's a new thing?
[05:28:59] <hololeap> shibboleth: it's the cosmic rays
[05:29:22] <tomreyn> MrPockets: i would definitely do the bios update to test whether this helps overcome the problem.

[07:36:09] <ananke> what progress? there's a splintered universe. I'd not want to be in shoes of some small project, trying to provide usable software to a wide audience
[07:36:11] <katp32> I don't get why this is so complicated. if you don't like your system package manager, don't use a distro that uses that package manager?
[07:36:14] <Dagmar> I also imagine quite a lot of it will turn out to be "an easy mechanism for organizing hoarded vulnerable libraries"
[07:36:31] <ananke> katp32: that's such a stupid straw man argument
[07:36:36] <katp32> what??
[07:37:19] <ananke> katp32: which part? straw man argument? you're proposing that the reason why people would use flat packs is 'because they don't like their package manager'
[07:37:49] <Dagmar> _Users_ use flatpaks typically because they don't know any better.
[07:37:50] <katp32> yes, I am. why then, in your infinite wisdom, are you using flatpak, instead of your system package manager?
[07:37:58] <Dagmar> Developers who use it aren't much ahead of them

[09:30:44] <katp32> nobody is allowed to talk, this is a strictly zero talking channel, someone should really put +m on it
[09:30:48] <Dagmar> I just blew away both keychains and it made new ones that it doesn't care for

[09:31:25] <katp32> :)
[09:31:52] <Dunce> I thought you guys were originally talking about Yubikeys or something, but instead you're referring to that "database" of keys to verify downloads in various repositories?
[09:32:03] <Dunce> Like, the one Arch has?
[09:32:06] <Dagmar> Dunce: No, actually Chrome can now talk to the operating systems keystore
[09:32:07] <kirk781> katp32, I would back you up but I am not sure if earendel is mod here or not :p
[09:32:20] <Dunce> Dagmar, oh thanks for clarifying.
[09:32:20] <earendel> i am not.
[09:32:38] <hime> pretty sure nobody talking right now is a mod
[09:32:45] <Dagmar> There ahve been some recent changes to the way that works under Linux tho, and now the kernel can manage those directly
[09:32:47] <kirk781> Dagmar is, I guess
[09:32:54] <pnbeast> earendel, I'm sorry, but I had to say this.  I hope it doesn't upset you.
[09:33:07] <Dagmar> I figure quite possibly Gnome might have switched to using the new mechanisms and Chrome has just not quite caught up to it yet
[09:33:27] <hime> pnbeast: had to say what? you haven't said anything
[09:33:40] <katp32> they had to say "I had to say this"
[09:33:58] <katp32> insert xkcd about self referential jokes
[09:33:58] <kirk781> Dagmar, It was happening on an older kernel. On Fedora, it hasn't happened with Edge. I'll try Chromium and see. If it doesn't happen there as well, then it's an issue that was resolved with the kernel finally
[09:34:01] <hime> oh, well then I have to say that I have to say that I have to say this

[09:38:48] <kirk781> That't what my psychiatrist asked too :p
[09:38:57] <Dagmar> kirk781: Probably because those guys haven't figured out how to run their own repo yet
[09:39:09] <Dunce> Dagmar, well there's a few features Edge offers on Windows that are pretty nice, but I don't think they'll work on Linux.
[09:39:17] <Dunce> Like, Windows Defender Application Guard.
[09:39:28] <katp32> I haven't used windows (on a personal device) for like probably nearly 10 years, except for one time for like a month

[09:48:08] <Dunce> That doesn't make any sense with the DMZ I'm thinking of.
[09:48:12] <Sauvin> No, it's a "demilitarised zone", but it's about keeping certain ranges of ports open while keeping most other ports closed.
[09:48:58] <Dagmar> Mainly it's an isolated network where you just put all the filth and tighly restrict it's access to anything
[09:49:33] <Dagmar> It's like the only netblock in this house allowed to communicate with servers in China

If I then delete the files written and begin writing again on the same but empty ext4 partition, initial write speeds are at 80MiB/s. What's the deal there?

[17:24:51] <ioxzev1z> TJ-, will have to check
[17:25:49] <hime> of course ip forwarding can be done...that's how I serve my own lan
[17:25:56] <TJ-> ioxzev1z: the obvios SMR answer is "because the blocks are having to be read and rewritten" but there may be something else going on

[17:26:41] <ioxzev1z> TJ-, I get how SMR works, but I can't seem to find a tool for trimming the unused blocks, so I'm guessing that once the drive is full, then emptied, the drive isn't sure itself what's in use and what's not

[18:04:18] <hime> dagmar: are you familiar with fio by chance?
[18:04:31] <Dagmar> Like, _somewhere_ along the way I wound up learning that Microsoft's VPN client was something they _bought_ from some small company that was originally apparently forking either OpenVPN or FreeS/WAN and part of the reason what it can actually do is thoroughly undocumented stemmed from that
[18:04:40] <Dagmar> hime: A bit.  Usually I just use bonnie++
[18:04:54] <hime> the vpn user isn't even in the channel anymore, just relax and let some steam off

[18:07:16] <hime> dagmar: did anything seem terribly "wrong" with my above command then, if you can tell?
[18:07:43] <Dagmar> hexnewbie: The truly ironic thing was that after manually trying pretty much every combination of VPN tunnel settings the SonicWall was capable of, there was no usable common denominator because the VPN tunnel on the Pixel 3 is bugged and breaks after 90 seconds
[18:07:44] <hime> I used the same params for all (non/raid) configs
[18:07:49] <jim> opal, :P (by the way, the rule is against -excessive- profanity; you've only done one, so: please watch the language while you're here)

[18:22:46] <Chpy0> I have an fpga thats cheaper than that I can run a tiny risc-v core on
[18:23:12] <Chpy0> I should add a risc-v interpreter to minetest
[18:23:22] <Dagmar> ...but the 1212 encoder will take in two composite _or_ component video inputs and will hand you h.264 streams (although horribly encoded) without a lot of fuss and bother

[19:03:32] <hime> there's good reasons for it, and it makes plenty enough sense for its primary intended audience...you just have to keep in mind that you are not a professional broadcaster, and you most likely won't know many of the differences that distinguish what you want or expect vs them

[20:57:31] <jan6> from what I've heard/seen, you have to define EVERYTHING and convert everything explictly, like if you have a 1.0 as an argument when expecting an int, it doesn't even allow that, lol
[20:57:38] <msiism> I mean, Ada is a real drag in some respects. But I can live with that.
[20:57:54] <msiism> jan6: Right.
[20:57:57] <jan6> AKA sounds like it's an absolute pain, at the name of guaranteeing you cannot make math mistakes
[20:58:18] <msiism> Or mistakes in general.
[20:58:42] <msiism> I don't have much confidence in my own cleverness, so I have to use these kinds of tools.

[22:45:01] <velix> TheGuestMovie: for compatiblity reasons, we're using Office 365, but we have damn problems with it.
[22:45:14] <msiism> LibreOffice does crash for me regularly, especially in conjunction with HexChat.
[22:45:15] <TheGuestMovie> It's not an issue in Ubuntu where you can check "minimal: browser & accessories only", but on Debian, installing a desktop means you get the whole kitchensink

[23:41:46] <lovetruth> One question... - can I change the cmdline parameters from the initramfs just before systemd boots?... :) So that /proc/cmdline will show systemd.unit=rescue.target   - for example?... :)
