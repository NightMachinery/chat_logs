[00:51:46] <roosterphant> want to set up sasl on libera

[01:06:23] <roosterphant> sorry for the noise everyone (:
[01:08:44] <acidsys> looks good roosterphant 
[01:12:19] <DarthGandalf> roosterphant: you don't need cert for sasl
[01:12:26] <DarthGandalf> you need cert only if you want the external sasl mech
[01:12:36] <DarthGandalf> sasl plain works without cert
[01:14:20] <roosterphant> hm
[01:14:26] <roosterphant> is there a benefit to also having cert?
[01:15:05] <DarthGandalf> it can be safer in a sense that mitm between znc and ircd can't learn the password if you don't send one
[01:20:40] <roosterphant> so if i remove plain it would be safer?

[01:55:46] <roosterphant> if i drop plain i dont need to store the nickserv password on my znc, right
[01:55:56] <roosterphant> whats the upside to plain
[01:56:04] <bookworm> there's no threat attached to using a one time use auto generated password
[01:57:06] <bookworm> if you use a cert, the cert file is essentially the same thing as a password on disc... just a really really long password
[01:57:55] <qwerty> ^
[01:59:30] <roosterphant> yh and i still keep my nickserv password private if the znc server is compromised
[01:59:46] <roosterphant> so in which threat model is plain safer?
[02:00:07] *** Quits: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c) (Quit: :P)
[02:00:08] <bookworm> if they get your cert, they can identify as you to nickserv  and do whatever
[02:00:10] <MetaNova> if you're following best practices, a leaked password shouldn't matter much, since it was only used in one place
[02:00:17] <bookworm> ^ that
[02:01:09] <MetaNova> if you DO reuse passwords then you're already playing with fire and are effectively asking, is it worse if my house burns down on a Wednesday, or a Saturday?
[02:01:14] <MetaNova> because, there's little difference
[02:08:44] <roosterphant> oh yh right
[02:08:50] <roosterphant> dunno why i had it in my mind that it would work like 2fa
[02:09:40] <roosterphant> i guess then cert is a little better since my pw has less than 512 bits of entropy

[12:02:40] <MetaNova> rockworld: ZNC does not impede the use of DCC
[12:03:09] <MetaNova> as I understand it, DCC is handed off directly to the client

[12:04:02] <MetaNova> there is nothing you can change in ZNC to make DCC work if it is not
[12:06:29] <MetaNova> furthermore I'd recommend using a bot which doesn't require gymnastics to use it, such as DCC CHAT

[12:13:27] <rockworld> or like you said it might be a configuration issue I did 
[12:14:51] <MetaNova> the only ways ZNC can help/interfere with DCC is either by blocking it outright by having a CTCP reply for DCC set blank, or by specifying the DCCBindHost
[12:15:58] <MetaNova> if you didn't configure a blank response for CTCP DCC, and changing the DCCBindHost, well, I simply don't know how to help you
