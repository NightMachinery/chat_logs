[02:43:38] <rzwitserloot> leftyfb PHP is not installed. Nobody (potentially) malicious has login access to this server, let alone write access to anything it hosts, and no dynamic content is available at all. Somebody with access rights `scp`'s a tarbz2 in there and then sshs in to run a script that just unpacks it in a dir served by apache2. That's all that ever happens.

[04:42:13] <sarnold> guzzlefry: mine are hand-me-downs so maybe newer ones do better, but I'd be surprised. I think pipewire has better BT codec support than pulseaudio, but I really don't understand the software stack
[04:42:29] <sarnold> guzzlefry: yeah, bluetooth is implemented via two or three dozen codecs / protocols
[04:42:48] <sarnold> guzzlefry: and some sound pretty horrible but work almost everywhere, some sound great but require horrible drivers everywhere, etc

[04:45:33] <Deepspeed> yeah, I have some around-the-neck style bluetooth earbuds now.  I love them for staying out of the way while working.  And they make great earplugs when I'm playing music on stage, too.  Those work fine for Linux and everything else I've used them on so far.
[04:45:45] <Dan92129> btw,  the broadcom chip was inside my DELL Inspiron 15

[04:48:38] <Deepspeed> LS HBS820S is the type I have now.  And I had a pair without the last S before which were nearly identical and also great.
[04:48:50] <Deepspeed> My last pair got stolen.  I liked them enough to get another if that counts for anything.
[04:49:32] <guzzlefry> thanks, I'll give them a look

[05:12:29] <sarnold> it's pretty common to fire up a vm, log in, try to install something, and there's updates being installed so your apt install gets wedged waiting for the lock..

[16:33:00] <brandoneliza> I have an hp printer that is connected to my system via USB. If I pull out the paper to stop a print job then cancel the job with CUPS the job is cancelled. THe printer blinks red after that. If I turn on the printer again it reinitialises. I noticed if I issue any print job aftre this it takes about 4 minutes for the job to move from pending to actually printing.

[16:33:33] <brandoneliza> Is there a way to reduce this delay. Apart from restarting the system which makes CUPS send the job to the printer stat.

[20:15:27] <Slartibart> I have 3 displays connected to my computer, 1 of them by HDMI and the other 2 using a displayport splitter(hub?). Running kubuntu 21.10. The problem is that the displayport screens toggle on/off quite a lot. Not like powering off the displays, but they go black for a short (usually) time, then they come back on. Often enough to make it difficult to use them. Also this doesn't happen when running

[20:22:28] <anddam> just to have some keyword to look for the shortcuts
