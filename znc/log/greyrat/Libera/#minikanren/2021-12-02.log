[12:49:29] <amazigh> hello ;)
[12:49:54] <amazigh> is there an implementation of minikanren that on top of Scheme, that is procedural?
[12:50:07] <amazigh> I would like do to do stuff like:
[12:50:49] <amazigh> (project-assert my-project '(disj (conj foo bar) (conf foo qux)))
[20:01:10] <Zipheir> amazigh: What does project-assert do?
[20:02:11] <Zipheir> amazigh: The TRS implementation of mK is procedural, except for the sugar-topping of syntax.
[20:09:53] <amazigh> oh
[20:10:02] <amazigh> I should have checked that before asking
[20:10:16] <amazigh> I only remember about the macro sugar
[20:11:09] <amazigh> I need to build rules at runtime based on some specification
[20:11:29] <amazigh> ty
