[13:35:52] <Lolsomeone[m]> and yeah i did few modification to /etc/pacman.conf
[13:37:24] <Lolsomeone[m]> https://0x0.st/oKgZ.conf ( the modified pacman.conf )
[13:59:23] <Lolsomeone[m]> @BugsWriter
[14:16:28] <sla[m]12> <Lolsomeone[m]> "and yeah i did few modification..." <- run diff
[14:26:19] <Lolsomeone[m]> Ok
[14:29:53] <Lolsomeone[m]> <sla[m]12> "run diff" <- umm not having default pacman conf
[14:32:20] <sla[m]12> Lolsomeone[m]: extract it from the pacman package, duh
[14:32:29] <Lolsomeone[m]> ok
[14:32:36] <Lolsomeone[m]> and after doing so
[14:32:42] <sla[m]12> you can find the it in /var/cache/pacman/pkg
[14:32:50] <Lolsomeone[m]> yh but after that
[14:33:05] <sla[m]12> Lolsomeone[m]: see where you went wrong, or switch things one by one
[14:34:45] <Lolsomeone[m]> actually i am not willing to install stuff on /dev/sda2 as it just as few gigs left i arranged another storage (( /dev/sdb )) on which i wanna install future stuff
[14:35:35] <Lolsomeone[m]> Lolsomeone[m]: so for this i did modification to pacman conf so could you provide conf that would do this for me
[14:50:38] <sla[m]12> <Lolsomeone[m]> "image.jpeg" <- can you ls  your /usr/share/libalpm/scripts
[14:52:43] <sla[m]12>  RootDir = /path/to/root/dir
[14:52:43] <sla[m]12>     Set the default root directory for pacman to install to. This option is used if you want to install a package on a temporary mounted partition which is "owned" by another system, or for a chroot install. NOTE: If database path or log file are not specified on either the command line or in pacman.conf(5), their default location will be inside this root path.
[14:53:31] <sla[m]12> I think it need a working rootfs for this to work
[14:53:54] <sla[m]12> Idk, you should probably ask this in @archlinux
[14:54:26] <sla[m]12> If you are low on space try only moving cache to the new partition
[14:54:56] <Zbnssn[m]> <Lolsomeone[m]> "just did  pacman -S irssi but..." <- as root user?
[14:54:57] <sla[m]12> s/archlinux/archlinuxgroup/
[14:55:42] <Zbnssn[m]> I'd try to do smth like
[14:55:42] <Zbnssn[m]> sudo pacman -S emacs --overwrite '*'

[15:07:50] <Lolsomeone[m]> old prob got fixed anyhow but this new prob is beyond my understanding
[15:08:23] <Zbnssn[m]> maybe micro is not a command?
[15:09:00] <Zbnssn[m]> like if you install libnotify... the command to actually send notifications is "notify-send"
[15:10:11] <Lolsomeone[m]> okay but
[15:10:44] <Lolsomeone[m]> i guess its done in this way
[15:10:56] <Lolsomeone[m]> like i have used it few times
[15:11:10] <Zbnssn[m]> is micro ur editor?
[15:11:14] <Lolsomeone[m]> and i do the stuff just by doing micro lal.c
[15:11:32] <Zbnssn[m]> do pacman -S micro-git
[15:12:02] <Lolsomeone[m]> Zbnssn[m]: i use vim on local machine but micro on ssh :: micro just suits my phone's screen orientation

[19:13:11] <iamak[m]> Is bit warden the best password manager?
[19:15:51] <telegram_1385150> iamak[m]: for me.. yes
[19:16:08] <telegram_1385150> FOSS and existing for quite a while.. and trusted
[19:16:13] <y[m]> iamak[m]: Cant say if its best but using it for 1year now works great on all devices
[19:16:48] <telegram_1385150> there are other options like 1password.. idk what was the name.. and lastpass
[19:17:03] <telegram_1385150> but bitwarden is personal preference
[19:17:23] <AryaK[m]> bitwarden is the best foss one
[19:17:26] <AryaK[m]> but i use password store
[19:17:38] <AryaK[m]> i have it on a private codeberg repo
[19:17:49] <AryaK[m]> for syncing
[19:18:43] <telegram_1385150> AryaK[m]: what do you mean by password store?
[19:19:02] <telegram_1385150> is it a service.. or you referencing to an encrypted database kind of thing
[19:19:06] <telegram_1385150> * of thing?
[19:22:58] <AryaK[m]> passwordstore.org
[19:23:00] <AryaK[m]> the standard unix password manager
[19:31:27] <iamak[m]> Thanks I'll start using it
[19:31:48] <iamak[m]> I was not using password manager till then coz I was too lazy to set it up😂
[19:41:06] <iamak[m]> I can't use bitwarden without an account?
[19:41:23] <telegram_1385150> iamak[m]: no
[19:41:31] <telegram_1385150> create a protonmail account separately for it
[19:41:35] <telegram_1385150> that’s what i do
[19:42:02] <iamak[m]> I prefer completely offline apps😅
[19:42:19] <iamak[m]> Is there another password manager?
[19:42:27] <iamak[m]> Offline ^
