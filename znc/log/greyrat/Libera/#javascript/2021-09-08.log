[00:56:08] <ljharb> Modx3: why are you trying to "brute force" it
[00:56:48] <DPA> It's not encrypted, it's hashed, it seams. The only good thing about this is that it was only hashed twice. And you have the nonce.
[00:57:01] <GreenJello> this is probably off topic for being illegal
[00:57:04] <ljharb> i mean, it's doing all the encryption inside the browser, so it's zero protected
[00:57:23] <ljharb> i doubt it's illegal because of that ^ but it's likely unethical
[00:57:59] <GreenJello> in the US unauthorized access of computer systems is illegal
[00:58:13] <matsaman> how can you access them if you aren't authorized?
[00:58:13] <ljharb> sure
[00:58:16] <GreenJello> and helping someone commit a crime is illegal
[00:58:28] <ljharb> GreenJello: but access to something encrypted in a web browser on your own computer is always authorized
[00:58:43] <ljharb> GreenJello: it's impossible to prohibit, legally or technically, someone from messing with the contents of a webpage that's running on their own machine
[00:59:07] <celphi> uhm that's failed logic
[00:59:11] <ljharb> how do
[00:59:13] <ljharb> *how so
[00:59:18] <ljharb> if the part being "brute forced" is a private key that never leaves the server, then sure, that's not ok
[00:59:29] <ljharb> but if the private key is on your machine, it belongs to you
[01:00:32] <celphi> your 2nd statement is incorrect.

[01:01:21] <pavonia> Whch statement is wrong?
[01:01:32] <celphi> " it's impossible to prohibit, legally or technically, someone from messing with the contents of a webpage that's running on their own machine"

[01:10:51] <banana_> you can enforce anything
[01:10:57] <Modx3> 23333
[01:11:02] <matsaman> I believe celphi is trying to draw a (pointless) distinction between being able to _say_ something is illegal and being able to actually _enforce_ something
[01:11:13] <matsaman> it's particular silly given the etymology of 'prohibit'
[01:11:26] <matsaman> and y'know English in general, but whateverses
[01:11:32] <ljharb> any law you can't enforce doesn't exist in practice, and so doesn't count
[01:11:47] <celphi> Well for obvious reasons you can find a group of legistratrs to pass something to make it illegal. So to say it's impossible is wrong.
[01:11:48] <ljharb> that's even the basis for the supreme court overturning laws.
[01:11:52] <matsaman> that's true, but it's also true that laws can exist even if they practically don't =)
[01:11:56] <ljharb> celphi: no, because they wouldn't be able to enforce it
[01:12:01] <ljharb> celphi: and laws that can't be enforced are invalid
[01:12:02] <matsaman> but that's all beside the point
[01:12:08] <matsaman> pointing this out is pointless =P
[01:12:15] <ljharb> like, legally speaking, they are made invalid retroactively once discovered.
[01:12:18] <celphi> You didnt say enforced. YOu said prohibit
[01:12:19] <Modx3> some guy r really fkn dumb and they think they are smart detictives
[01:12:31] <matsaman> it's just like
[01:12:32] <ljharb> celphi: and your pedantry here doesn't change the obvious meaning i implied

[01:12:43] <Modx3> guys*
[01:12:54] <ljharb> celphi: prohibiting requires making it ENFORCEABLY illegal.
[01:12:56] <matsaman> you realize that for the convenient of language, it's stilly to point out every assertion that wouldn't make an aspie happy
[01:12:59] <ljharb> celphi: if it's not enforceable then it's not actually prohibited.
[01:12:59] <celphi> nope

[01:15:25] <ljharb> celphi: i still maintain that "prohibit" was the right word to use there.
[01:15:31] <matsaman> it was a fine word
[01:15:45] <ljharb> anything that's prohibited but unenforceable becomes retroactively legal once the courts discover it. it's how legal systems work.

[03:24:22] <z1haze> how can I make one event listener take precedence over another?
[03:25:16] <z1haze> eg, I have a submit listener on a form to run validation, and if its invalid, i run stopPropagation, and then I have another form handler below that that i want to use to actually handle the valid form, but this handler is getting run first
[03:26:05] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:26:09] <z1haze> something like this is what I have https://bpa.st/ZITA
[03:26:59] <GreenJello> could you not add two listeners?
[03:27:23] <z1haze> what do you mean? this is effectively 2 listeners
[03:27:52] <z1haze> the first one at line 9, the second one at line 15
[03:28:37] <GreenJello> you could exclude it from the first thing that adds the listener, and call the validation code on line 16
[03:28:51] <GreenJello> and have it return if it's valid or not
[03:29:13] <z1haze> wouldnt it then doublebind to that form
[03:29:18] <z1haze> it would be running the validation twice
[03:29:37] <GreenJello> "exclude it from the first thing"
[03:29:42] <z1haze> for example, i have some forms that i dont need to do any additional logic when the form is submitted, if the form is valid, it just submits a normal form submission to the server
[03:29:53] <GreenJello> it's weird that you're adding a submit listener to all forms
[03:30:07] <z1haze> oh, it is?
[03:30:18] <z1haze> thought it would be a good catch-all
[03:30:19] <GreenJello> but you can at least exclude one of them from that bulk thing
[03:30:54] <z1haze> you would explicitly handle each form separately?

[03:31:40] <z1haze> can I not just explicitly set the event handling order or something?
[03:31:45] <GreenJello> there are ways you could make it work, like having a mapping for form ids to event handlers, and looking up the handler for a specific form inside the event handler
[03:31:49] <z1haze> i know jquery will emit events in the order from which they are defined

[03:32:58] <GreenJello> if you have a direct relationship between them, it's going to avoid issues if you model that in the code instead of relying on the order

[03:33:42] <GreenJello> i.e. have one step call the other
[03:34:05] <z1haze> i thought i was doinga good thing with the validation catch-all but i suppose its not good
[03:35:18] <GreenJello> it could be fine as part of a larger framework with effort to solve for edge cases, or to make it opt-in

[03:35:50] <z1haze> yeah, this was more or less supposed to bake into the framework
[03:36:10] <z1haze> just an out of the box form validation
[03:36:55] <GreenJello> then you would register with the framework instead of the DOM
[03:40:15] <z1haze> well, i dont have all that at the moment
[03:40:57] <z1haze> when previously just binding the submit event to the validate method, i was able to prevent the default submission and stop propagation, if calling the method within the event listener callback, I can no longer do that, right?

I've been doing some reading though, and I'm seeing stuff about how oauth implicit flow was good for a while, but since the token lives in an insecure place, it can be stolen and there's no way for the server to know. This seems to also be true for using a local strategy with JWT, but I

[07:58:04] <xochilpili> hello everyone
[07:58:44] <matsaman> hi
[07:58:53] <xochilpili> im trying to mock using jest mongoose.Types.ObjectId, but somehow im getting in my implementation mongoose_1.default.Types.ObjectId.isValid is not a function
[08:00:39] <vqueiroz> xochilpili: Just use npmjs.org/mongodb
[08:01:07] <hax> mongoose recommends mocha iirc
[08:01:13] <xochilpili> vqueiroz, what you mean, im using mongoose
[08:02:53] <vqueiroz> xochilpili: That's where the problem lives. There's everything wrong with that library. Stop and use MongoDB original driver. The future is not great when you put Mongoose on your project. It leads you to all that is wrong with the software development world.
[08:04:58] <xochilpili> vqueiroz, i cant change that

[19:50:21] <ezzieyguywuf> is `<h1 style="color: {pin ? '#333' : '#ccc'}">{view}</h1>` the ternary operator used here a javascript thing? or html? or css? or is it specific to svelte (I'm working through the svelte tutorial at the moment)
[19:51:06] <theskillwithin> javascript
[19:51:35] <ThePendulum> that's not going to work without svelte though
[19:51:59] <ThePendulum> the ternary is JS, the ability to put JS in a style attribute that way is svelte
[19:52:19] <ezzieyguywuf> interesting - so how might it looked using just raw js?
[19:53:12] <ThePendulum> in a separate script, document.querySelector('h1').style.color = pin ? '#333' : '#ccc';
[19:53:41] <ezzieyguywuf> ah I see.
[19:53:44] <ThePendulum> in vue it'd be :style="{ color: pin ? '#333' : '#ccc' }" which on face value I like more because the entire definition is JS, not just the color itself
[19:53:47] <ezzieyguywuf> that makes perfect sence.
[19:53:53] <ezzieyguywuf> *sense
[19:54:07] <ThePendulum> of course you'll want a more specific selector than h1 in practice, otherwise it will just grab the first h1 on the page
[19:54:19] <ezzieyguywuf> sure
[19:54:39] <ezzieyguywuf> javascript is a lot more legit than I ever gave it credit for
[19:54:51] <ezzieyguywuf> esepecially since the 2015 or 2016 updates
[19:55:07] <ThePendulum> you'll probably also want to toggle classes rather than set the color directly, so document.querySelector('h1.title').classList.add('light'), .remove('light') etc.
[19:55:22] <ThePendulum> and then define what those classes look like in CSS
[19:55:29] <ezzieyguywuf> ThePendulum: or the equivalent in svelte
[19:55:36] <ezzieyguywuf> but yea, I was thinking the same, using different css classes
[19:56:19] <ThePendulum> correct, I haven't used svelte in particular but in other frameworks you'd generally use its way of setting classes, in vue it'd be :class="{ light: pin }" for example
[19:56:46] <ThePendulum> I only set colors directly if it could be an entire palette, like username colors or something
[19:57:17] *** Quits: cyberbanjo (~malik@172.58.172.8) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[20:23:08] *** Joins: gehn (~gehn@user/gehn)
[20:24:10] <systemfault> It makes it harder because other programming languages give you assumptions that are simply not true in JS.
[20:24:46] <systemfault> Examples: How "this" works in JS. How async programming works in JS. How boolean operators work in JS.
[20:25:31] <ezzieyguywuf> ah
[20:25:32] <ezzieyguywuf> gotcha
[20:25:52] <ezzieyguywuf> I'd hope that an experienced programmer would go into it with enough forethought to understand that things will be different
[20:26:14] <systemfault> No, that's not how humans work.
[20:26:59] <ljharb> and it's even less how people who are confident in their own experience work
[20:27:57] <systemfault> JS has been very painful to learn for me at first... because I had a C++/Java programming mindset.
[20:28:35] <systemfault> You try to reuse in JS what you already know... sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
[20:28:55] <systemfault> Sometimes it works fine but lead to weird code that a JS dev would never write.
[20:29:22] <systemfault> (Non idiomatic code)
[20:30:01] <khanred> I only write idiotic code
[20:30:47] <systemfault> At least, now... there's eloquent. Back in the days, I used "JavaScript: The good parts" which is a terrible tutorial and whatever I could read on the web.

[21:31:44] <daoudr> GreenJello: ^
[21:33:32] <GreenJello> daoudr, the console is a REPL which prints the last value, and console.log returns undefined
[21:33:48] <GreenJello> strange that there isn't also a log, though
[21:34:48] <daoudr> it worked on eclipe but not on firefox console
[21:35:07] <GreenJello> jsfiddle does load all sorts of garbage, so using dev tools on that tab is a bad idea
[21:35:33] <GreenJello> opening about:blank if you want to use the console is generally a good idea

[21:36:15] <xochilpili> that's the main reason of es6, using lexical binding
[21:37:34] <daoudr> xochilpili: I am trying to understand to get 5 why do I need to console log the function instead of just calling it directly
[21:38:25] *** Joins: killall (~killown@user/killown)

[21:39:36] <xochilpili> you can: var myReturnedValue = addToThis.call(obj, 3)) < and you will need also a console.log(myReturnedValue);
[21:40:52] <xochilpili> if you dont want to print what value it's returned via console.log then you might need a debugger, to see it, but dunno what's the point here?
