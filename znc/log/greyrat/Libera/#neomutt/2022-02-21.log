[03:27:58] <aplund> oh.. I see.  New colour handling.
[03:29:19] <ngortheone> wow, interesting
[03:29:29] <ngortheone> I haven't used master in a while
[03:30:40] <ngortheone> I was thinking about rewriting my colors - they don't match my terminal colors well
[03:31:02] <ngortheone> aplund please report back on your impressions of the new color handling
[03:31:46] <keir> they will never match well, i'd say; since neomutt is limited to 256 colors
[03:35:19] <ngortheone> yeah
[03:37:16] <ngortheone> And having tried working on neomutt's code I know why it is not easy to bring trueclolr support

[13:27:14] <flatcap> morning all
[13:44:47] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[13:45:08] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[13:45:27] <flatcap> thanks for the issue. I'll have a look in a sec
[13:46:03] <gahr> np, I was wondering why we have both the setting sidebar_visible and the function sidebar-toggle-visible..

[13:49:00] *** Joins: va5c0_ (~vasco.nun@91.110.154.119)

[14:27:28] <flatcap> the colours used to be stored in reverse order: STAILQ_INSERT_HEAD()
[14:28:03] <flatcap> but I accidentally flipped that, to STAILQ_INSERT_TAIL(), meaning the priorities got messed up

[14:39:21] <flatcap> gahr: if/when you have a sec, please can you try [devel/index-color] - it should fix the sidebar repaint problem

[14:46:58] <gahr> it does, yep
[14:47:07] <flatcap> thanks
[14:47:54] <gahr> what was wrong with the assumption that // Config notifications will do the rest ?
[14:48:08] <gahr> cause "toggle sidebar_visible" doesn't have the issue
[14:49:32] <flatcap> after entering a command, neomutt assumes the worst and refreshes everything
[14:50:39] <flatcap> the original toggle function had a window_reflow(), which I removed
[14:52:54] *** Joins: BrunoFontes (~bruno@191.32.136.226)
[14:53:31] <flatcap> I don't think the comment's true any more, now that the pager and index are unware of the sidebar
[15:00:53] <gahr> ah don't we have specific settings that cause a reflow?
[15:01:26] <gahr> like, I guess setting from shouldn't cause a repaint like setting pager_index_lines
[15:14:46] <flatcap> there used to be a *gui* flag in the config definitions
[15:15:13] <flatcap> but that got factored out to reduced dependencies
[15:16:00] <gahr> I see
[15:16:14] <gahr> so basically we refresh after modifying any config variable
[15:16:27] <gahr> well, after running any command
[15:16:48] <flatcap> after any command, yes
[15:17:37] <flatcap> most of the actions that a command will perform _probably_ already send notifications
[15:18:07] <flatcap> for now, we refresh everything
[15:18:30] <gahr> ok
[15:18:52] <flatcap> there are still a bunch of R_MENU, R_INDEX flags in mutt_config.c
[15:19:07] <flatcap> they need to go, too
[15:20:10] <flatcap> I'm currently looking at fixing all the screen refreshing -- trying to break struct Menu out of the middle of it all
[15:23:30] <flatcap> btw, I did some digging into the <functions>, but not managed to write a doc that explains it very well
[15:24:35] <flatcap> the generic menu is a pain, but it (mostly) can be split into "menu functions" (motions in an index, etc) and "global functions"
[15:26:24] <flatcap> but... not all users of a menu need OP_DELETE
[15:29:04] <flatcap> users might want to globally bind 'd' to OP_DELETE, but then who filters it out?

[17:00:00] <flatcap> #3264 - The start of some ideas
[17:00:00] <neo-bot> 🔧 discussion by @flatcap "Splitting Functions" with 1 comment: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/discussions/3264
[17:01:15] *** Joins: mord0d (~mord0d@gateway/tor-sasl/mord0d)
[17:06:18] <gahr> global functions are not an issue
[17:07:09] <gahr> cause they do the same thing no matter where you are
[17:07:22] <flatcap> yes, but currently many of them part of OpGeneric
[17:07:44] <gahr> the issue is with i) functions that do different things based on who handles them, and ii) functions that could be matched by different instances of the same menu [index, index(attach)]
[17:08:20] <flatcap> indeed
[17:08:28] <gahr> what if OpGeneric handled only the global functions?
[17:08:48] <gahr> assuming we can introduce per-menu unique names
[17:08:55] <gahr> OP_INDEX_DELETE vs OP_ATTACH_DELETE
[17:09:36] <gahr> I think ii) is solvable if you always start searching at the focussed menu
[17:10:13] <flatcap> simple answer: don't know
[17:10:34] <gahr> yeah I unfortunately don't have the cycles to give it enough thought
[17:10:44] <flatcap> I'm not sure how ":push <string><of><varied><functions>" will be handled
[17:10:46] <gahr> I guess this needs some organic approach
[17:11:33] <gahr> I think push should do late binding
[17:11:38] <flatcap> eblake reported a problem with a folder-hook (I couldn't repeat), but I haven't seen him since
[17:11:41] <gahr> and lookup <of> only after <string> has been executed
[17:12:08] <gahr> so <change-folder>?<next> would go into the folder browser and select the one below
[17:12:10] <flatcap> yeah, that'd be the sensible thing to do
[17:12:57] <flatcap> currently, push looks up each of <a><b><c> and converts them to OP_A, OP_B, OP_C
[17:13:16] <flatcap> we'd need to queue the raw push string
[17:13:43] <flatcap> and remember that it's a push string that is subject to <function> matching
[17:15:52] <flatcap>  
[17:16:14] <flatcap> I'm not entirely convinced we need to distinguish OP_INDEX_DELETE vs OP_ATTACH_DELETE
[17:16:54] <flatcap> clearly, if the attach dialog can't delete something, OP_DELETE shouldn't be delegated to the index
[17:17:27] <flatcap> I'm quite not sure how that'd work
[17:17:52] <flatcap> I keep going over the top-down and focus-up traversing
[17:20:42] <flatcap> if the user's presented with a menu (list), then it's useful if the motion keys, sort keys, delete/undelete keys, etc are consistent
[17:22:03] <gahr> on the other hand
[17:22:13] <gahr> it's useful to be able to up/down the index and the sidebar independently
[17:22:21] <gahr> now this is possible because those functions are separate
[17:22:26] <flatcap> yes
[17:22:37] <gahr> it's ok that I bind index j down, bind pager j down
[17:22:38] <flatcap> unless <sidebar-prefix><up>
[17:22:51] <gahr> but I think it's a configuration thing
[17:23:02] <gahr> so I'd rather have bind index j index-down, bind pager j pager-down
[17:23:09] <gahr> and provide meaningful defaults
[17:23:21] <gahr> so I can 
[17:23:28] <gahr> so I'd rather have bind index j index-down, bind pager j index-down, bind pager J pager-down
[17:23:29] <flatcap> and we've only got a finite number of keys
[17:23:32] <gahr> if I want
[17:23:47] <gahr> yeah, true
[17:24:24] <gahr> but you'd only have a unique (key, menu)
[17:24:28] <gahr> like now
[17:25:01] <flatcap> hmm...
[17:25:20] <flatcap> the index and pager movements would require separate functions in my scheme too

[17:26:06] <flatcap> the pager isn't a menu
[17:26:18] <flatcap> currently there's a lot of overlap of names

[20:29:24] <spoofer> Is there something I need to do to flush the debugoutput when running with -d6?
[20:30:56] <flatcap> no, it should be flushed line by line
[20:31:39] <flatcap> though if you're filtering it, `grep --line-buffered` is useful
[20:31:49] <spoofer> Hmmm, I synced to master and the colors are segfaulting, but probably something to do with my setup.  
[20:32:28] <spoofer> And trying to find a useful question or reproduction case.
[20:33:19] <spoofer> curses_color_new returns null, but I'm not seeing any of the color_debug lines in .neomuttdebug0.
[20:33:47] <flatcap> oh, do you have `./configure --debug-color` ?
[20:33:59] <spoofer> Most likely not.  Thank you.

[20:35:09] <spoofer> Nope.
[20:35:11] <flatcap> thanks
[20:35:32] <flatcap> in that case, if i'm not around feel free to comment on #3261
[20:35:32] <neo-bot> Issue by @z2v "Segfault on start after upgrade": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3261
[20:35:58] <flatcap> I tried a few variations of minimal config, but I couldn't reproduce it
[20:37:26] <flatcap> I've just pushed a bunch of small gui fixes to master...
[20:38:06] <flatcap> they're unlikely to affect your problem, but it'll rule out a few other problems
[20:38:43] <spoofer> okay, I'll resynch.  Thanks.
[20:49:56] <spoofer> Does the uppercase string 'BAD' mean something in a regex?
[20:51:04] <flatcap> no, that's literal
[20:51:08] <spoofer> Very weird, it has to be uppercase and the string has to be that length, otherwise it "works"
[20:51:39] <flatcap> pardon?!
[20:51:48] <spoofer> rather, I think it's the string length that is key.
[20:51:56] <flatcap> how very strange
[20:52:18] * flatcap builds ...
[20:53:37] <spoofer> Sorry for the distraction, I'll keep poking as when I have a few more minutes and try and have something more reproducable.
[20:53:49] <flatcap> great, thanks
