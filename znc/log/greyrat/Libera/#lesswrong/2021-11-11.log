[00:08:29] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: the state is the only entity allowed to decide whether you're a slave or not
[00:08:48] <rmmh> and many prisons are private
[00:08:58] <rmmh> so you have private enterprises figuring out the most effective uses for these slaves
[00:09:04] <rmmh> a lot of it is agricultural, as always
[00:09:51] <kuudes> over here prisoners must be paid the same as other people
[00:10:00] <kuudes> and there is no forced labor in prisons
[00:10:11] <rmmh> we get it you don't have slaves
[00:10:15] <gwern> the only good thing you can use them for given observability and low automatability of many agricultural tasks still... would you trust, or find useful, prisoners in call centers? it's interesting that stuff like firefighting *does* work
[00:10:35] <saturn2> finland still has income taxes
[00:10:45] <rmmh> yes but taxation is merely theft, not slavery
[00:11:23] <saturn2> what's the difference?
[00:14:20] <catern> i guess you can leave
[00:14:29] <ggreer> not if you're an american :(
[00:14:29] <catern> but all the slaveowners collude
[00:14:37] <catern> ggreer: well you can renounce your citizenship
[00:15:03] <catern> although that costs money so maybe we should call it "buying yourself from your owner"
[00:15:18] <ggreer> you have to pay an exit tax
[00:16:31] <catern> really? wow wtf
[00:16:42] <catern> so yeah, it's like buying yourself (and your assets) from your owner
[00:17:48] <catern> actually it's kind of surprising that the exit tax isn't higher, since who's even lobbying for it to be lower?
[00:17:55] <rmmh> it's like $10k?
[00:18:04] <ggreer> I don't know. I think it depends on your net worth
[00:18:05] <catern> I guess it disincentivize immigrants
[00:18:28] <two2thehead> gwern, wtf, I love the clergy now? D:
[00:18:38] <catern> rmmh: ggreer: yeah I was just looking it up, it sounds like it's paying capital gains tax on your assets (in addition to the flat 10k or so fee)
[00:18:49] <rmmh> The US imposes an 'Exit Tax' when you renounce your citizenship if you meet certain criteria. Generally, if you have a net worth in excess of $2 million the exit tax will apply to you. This tax is based on the inherent gain (in dollar terms) on ALL YOUR ASSETS (including your home).

[00:20:39] <kuudes> saturn2, you can avoid taxation by stopping doing anything that brings income
[00:20:51] <kuudes> in slavery you get punished if you stop working
[00:20:53] <catern> anyway, luckily the US is the kindest master with the most slaves
[00:21:09] <catern> so I don't want to pay the US to allow a new master to buy me

[00:23:38] <two2thehead> kuudes, wait, so if I have enough invested and live on passive income/live off my interest generated, would I have to pay tax?
[00:23:44] <kuudes> passive income is income
[00:23:49] <two2thehead> ah
[00:24:00] <kuudes> dividends and stock sell gains are income
[00:24:03] <adiabatic> two2thehead: nvidia, intel, and apple? aren't there more?

[00:36:27] <kuudes> hmm, you might be correct; there would be property tax over the housing, but the person without income living there is eligible to housing benefit and social assistance
[00:37:16] <kuudes> and it is the duty of towns to house anyone in need in any case, money or not
[00:38:17] <catern> the slaveowner is charitable and has a paternalistic obligation to its slaves
[00:38:57] <feep> better than not, surely
[00:40:40] <kuudes> if you live in your own forest, that is tax free given forestland is free of property tax
[00:40:57] <feep> but what of the matter of swamps
[00:41:15] <kuudes> but welfare is not per state wants, but of duty
[00:41:33] <kuudes> so it must be paid, similarly as taxes must be paid
[00:41:54] <saturn2> then the people with incomes are enslaved to the people without
[00:41:55] <kuudes> so no, I don't see rectsstaats would be slave owners.
[00:42:11] <kuudes> maybe. but they are free to stop having incomes themselves
[00:43:06] <catern> can i build a house in the forest?
[00:43:16] <saturn2> then where would the social assistance come from?
[00:43:19] <catern> followup question, can I build a forest in the house?
[00:43:33] <kuudes> latter clearly no
[00:43:40] <adiabatic> if your house is the size of an aircraft hangar‚Ä¶
[00:44:02] <kuudes> aircraft hangar is still quite a small for a forest, it would be just some trees

[04:26:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: All the alternative phrases are crazy libertarian ones
[04:27:11] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: like what?
[04:27:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> (That was a joke, I don't actually know any)
[04:27:47] <catern> one alternative is, like, "policy" or "policy proposals" or something along those lines
[04:27:59] <catern> but I'm not sure how to indicate it's, y'know, unusual policy

[04:38:16] <catern> Betawolf: sure, I don't have to talk about politics at work, and anyway I wouldn't call myself a libertarian, I just like mechanism design...
[04:39:20] <catern> let me upgrade that "I don't have to talk about politics at work" to "I desperately want to avoid talking about politics at work"

[04:58:20] <gwern> I've said this many times
[04:59:30] <catern> that sucks but I'm sure he's happy to sacrifice for the cause (and is only bothered about the loss of instrumentally-useful influence)
[05:00:10] <gwern> it's been interesting watching the manufacturing of academic pedigree. for example, look at how often it namedrops I.J. Good. but I can tell you first hand *no one* was mentioning Good until lukeprog dug him up
[05:01:21] <catern> that is interesting
[05:03:00] <gwern> yeah. this is one thing that soured me on schmidhuber. I realized that what he is doing is manufacturing history
[05:03:42] <gwern> creating an alternate reality/narrative where DL work flows from point A to point B to point C every few years, when in fact, B had no idea about A, and C was just tinkerin with A
[05:03:55] <gwern> academic pedigrees reward post hoc propter ergo hoc on a mass scale
[05:04:45] <catern> reminds me of Carl Hewitt's fabrication of his own prominence
[05:04:58] <catern> oh well
[05:06:04] <gwern> and of course, post-alphago, I find this intellectual forging to be not just merely annoying and bad epistemic practice, but a serious contribution to x-risk
[05:06:13] <catern> oh? why's that?
[05:06:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bah. I can't even eat tvorog + tea anymore. Doesn't taste like anything, so it's just like trying to force myself to swallow bland mush.
[05:06:27] <catern> because it decreases how "fire alarm" alphago seems?
[05:06:45] <gwern> by falsifying how progress actually happened, it prioritizes any kind of theoretical work, downplaying empirical work, implementation, trial-and-error, and the preeminent role of compute

[05:07:44] <gwern> in schmidhuber's history, everyone knows all about DL and meta-learning, and DL history is a grand triumphant march from the perceptron to the neocognitron to schmidhuber's LSTM to GPT-3 as a minor uninteresting extension of his fast memory work, all unfolding exactly as seen
[05:08:13] <catern> such fabrication reminds me to be glad to not be in academia
[05:08:24] <gwern> as opposed to what actually happened which was a bunch of apes poking in the mud drawing symbols grunting to each other until a big monolith containing a thousand GPUs appeared out of nowhere, the monkeys punched the keyboard a few times, and bow in aw
[05:08:43] <catern> perhaps you should write an alternative history?
[05:08:58] <gwern> and then going back and saying 'ah yes, Grog foresaw the monolith when he smashed his fist into the mud and mad a vague rectangular shape'
[05:09:30] <catern> you're influential enough that you might successfully set the record straight
[05:09:48] <gwern> unfortunately, it's hard, precisely because of the falsification of history in papers
[05:10:00] <gwern> you have to be very very lucky to get someone on the record actually explaining how something worked
[05:10:22] <catern> that is an unfortunate effect of peer review
[05:10:37] <catern> artificially incentivizing citation of preceeding work even if it had no relationship
[05:11:08] <gwern> my usual example is ResNets. super important, one of the most important discoveries in DL... and if you didn't read a bullshit PR interview MS PR put out in 2016 or something where they admit it was simply trying out random archs until it worked, all you have is the paper placidly explaining "*obviously* resnets are a good idea because they make the gradients flow and can be initialized to...
[05:11:14] <gwern> ...the identity transformation; in accordance with our theory, we implemented and trained a resnet cnn on imagenet..."
[05:11:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: re: papers: I was shocked to read this comment today https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/D5BP9CxKHkcjA7gLv/speaking-of-stag-hunts/comment/HZamCvkt5BTySnyJE where Ben Pace is like "academic papers in journals and such never correct bad or wrong arguments/conclusions/findings, and yet still the truth pretty much always comes out, which proves that it's unnecessary to correct bad/wrong stuff"
[05:11:41] <feepbot> Ben Pace comments on Speaking of Stag Hunts - LessWrong 2.0 viewer (I'm pretty confused by your numbered list, because they seem directly in contradiction with how scientific journals have worked historically. Here's a quote from an earlier post of mine: I looked through a volume of the London Math [snip])
[05:12:14] <catern> I guess this is the result of the influence of math: the pedigree doesn't matter, all that matters is that you've found The Truth and can explain why it's The Truth
[05:12:26] <catern> (how distastefully nonconstructive)
[05:13:54] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I think pace is perhaps equivocating here. he says 'scientific' but then he also says 'proofs'. you don't see many proofs in Replication Crisis papers. at least when it comes to math, what Pace says does seem to be more or less true: the papers may have errors, but the results are still usually true, and since it's math, if no one cares about this new object you defined, oh...
[05:14:00] <gwern> ...well, it's just some paper
[05:16:36] <gwern> my own interpretation is that proofs are misinterpreted: they're not actually there to provide eternal immutable guarantees of perfection, but as mental scaffolding. it'd be nice if it was in fact exactly correct, but once it has programmed the mind of the mathematician appropriately, then it has done its primary job. it may have bugs, but unless the bugs actually stop understanding, it's not...
[05:16:42] <gwern> ...a big deal
[05:17:35] <gwern> and this is why the results are usually right. the mind of a mathematician is a giant AI engine computing away in the background, doing its things unconsciously, with any conscious manipulation of symbols serving mostly to summarize the results. like a chess player
[05:18:20] <nshepperd2> mentats lol
[05:18:25] <mst> speaking as a pure maths grad ... ideally, certainly, yes
[05:18:54] <gwern> kasparov thinks for a while, mostly unconsciously using his visual cortex and long-term memory for pattern recognition to reject and prioritize moves, with only the hardest and most ambiguous choices rising to the level of consciousness, and emits a move. he can then give justifications for this move, which can be put into a rigorous computer-decidable form via tree search. they will often be...
[05:19:00] <gwern> ...correct! but they weren't *how* he computed that answer
[05:19:16] <saturn2> "why all of mathematics is false by john ioannidis jr, 2041"
[05:19:32] <mst> gwern: I am reminded how often teachers got mad at me for "not showing my working"
[05:19:50] <mst> apparently "I did, I just thought about the problem and this result popped out" wasn't the right answer
[05:19:51] <RiversHaveWings> you can compare what actually happened with a "one of us is sent back in time with all our present knowledge" fantasy scenario
[05:20:07] <RiversHaveWings> Where I immediately know to write a reverse mode autodiff implementation and know to use good activation functions and good optimizers and invent resnets and transformers immediately too
[05:20:15] <RiversHaveWings> And I would know that scaling works if you know the right algorithms so I demonstrate this and then go straight to FPGA then ASIC
[05:21:02] <gwern> (when kasparov writes down his explanation with jargon like "but then that would expose the rook to forking, and this better move puts more pressure on the center" and so on and so forth, he can't write down the tree search his mind actually did, but what he writes can reflect his high-level impressions of what his mind did, and the novice player reading it tries to imitate it and update his...
[05:21:08] <gwern> ...mind: "what does 'pressure on the center' *look like*? let's see... ah, it looks like this [possible board]. hm. I see.")
[05:21:33] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: how far back are you going, exactly?
[05:22:31] <RiversHaveWings> When did reverse mode become common, I remember having to write gradient implementations manually
[05:22:41] <RiversHaveWings> And patch them into backprop
[05:23:08] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: so from ben pace's perspective, worrying about too much bad math papers proposing new hypothetical objects/methods/fields is a bit like worrying about too many bad novels being published
[05:24:06] <RiversHaveWings> Because it was a thing, it just wasn't used *everywhere, automatically* like it is now
[05:24:52] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: I'm thinking more of the available compute. if you go back much further than 2009, you start talking about multi-month/year runs on easily available hardware. and it's not like FPGAs are easy to program, and ASICs are literally like $10m+ NRE for the simplest stuff, much less anything like a TPU

[05:27:54] <RiversHaveWings> Probably not
[05:28:34] <gwern> this is why I tend to imagine things like the National Labs' supercomputers. at some point consumer hardware just doesn't cut it

[05:33:32] <RiversHaveWings> nshepperd2: i think so

[05:36:31] <saturn2> you'd probably have to write your own code to put your data into a texture and pull out the result, but that's not so terrible
[05:36:40] <feep> stage sep good, stage 2 ignition good
[05:39:26] <nshepperd2> you would probably lose a bunch of performance from memory bandwidth being wasted moving stuff between the different gpu buffers and main memory

[06:28:14] <PlanckWalk> "Show your working" in math was never really about showing your working.  It's about convincing the marker that you know why your answer is correct.
[06:29:04] <PlanckWalk> I had to have this explicitly explained to me in year 8, and it made a lot more sense.
[06:31:11] <mst> this is both obvious and also irrelevant to anything I said.
[06:31:21] <PlanckWalk> It wasn't obvious to me!
[06:31:42] <mst> in fact the whole point of the conversation is that 'your working' is something convincing sounding
[06:31:48] <PlanckWalk> So yeah, many times I had to reverse-engineer some "working"
[06:31:55] <mst> and any relationship to how you got the right answer is irrelevant

[06:33:07] <mst> I mean, gwern's entire conversation was about the explanation not being relevant to the process
[06:33:17] <mst> I guess if you didn't read any of that it might seem worth saying
[06:33:39] <PlanckWalk> It's certainly the case that math papers bear no resemblance to the process of deriving the results.

[07:31:53] <gwern> but it's like - guys! muzero doesn't need a simulator, it learns a world model. it reaches strongly superhuman performance on go, and chess, and most of ALE. it's human-level sample-efficient on ALE. it also does continuous actionspaces like robotic stuff in DM Control Suite/Real-World RL Suite. its performance scales smoothly with compute. it can plan offline and learn from offline data. it...
[07:31:59] <gwern> ...handles partial observability. about the only classical RL thing it doesn't do is adversarial setups

[07:41:34] <PapuaHardyNet> it would be cool if we could use muzero (or any other RL algorithm) to model a part of the world that is super complex right now but is isolated enough that it is tenable
[07:41:45] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: practical? hm, hard to say. it costs a lot of compute and is very hard to implement right
[07:42:20] <gwern> I know me and a lot of other people are hoping that it gets used on a domain like sc or dota, to see if the latent modeling approach can plan over an abstract game tree, in essence
[07:42:42] <gwern> but the commercial value of a sc/dota bot is pretty low. e-sports aren't about games
[07:43:34] <PapuaHardyNet> Oh I had something more useful in mind, like a subset of the supply chain
[07:45:15] <catern> or finance
[07:46:17] <PapuaHardyNet> wdym, stock market prediction? I wonder if that is a bit too huge for muzero

[07:47:13] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: I barely know what muzero is, but yes, any kind of stock market prediction at any time scale (which can be turned fairly directly into money)
[07:47:46] <gwern> I think the problem with the stock market is that there's no stable problem to learn a world model of and then plan over
[07:48:08] <gwern> what are you going to do, predict all the fluctuations at 1s timesteps tomorrow?
[07:48:37] <PapuaHardyNet> ikr, that's a lot of noise
[07:48:57] <catern> "well, the world itself is the stable problem :)" is what I might say, but I don't know if that makes sense in context
[07:49:04] <gwern> supplychain optimization makes more sense as it could be learning stuff like how fast stores restock at different times and where it should dispatch resuply trucks
[07:49:30] <gwern> planning out resupply and logistics is amenable to being treated as a game
[07:49:46] <gwern> the problem there is you're comparing to incredibly optimized linear optimization approaches etc
[07:49:55] <gwern> so a hard area to make an attack on
[07:49:57] <PapuaHardyNet> here's an interesting idea - modelling people using RL
[07:50:14] <gwern> yeah, automl-zero would potentially benefit

[08:00:32] <catern> omohundro's comments in https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CpvyhFy9WvCNsifkY/discussion-with-eliezer-yudkowsky-on-agi-interventions sound really like
[08:00:44] <feepbot> Discussion with Eliezer Yudkowsky on AGI interventions - LessWrong (The following is a partially redacted and lightly edited transcript of a chat)
[08:00:49] <catern> "I think type theory is neat! Maybe we can uses type theory to solve this problem"
[08:01:47] <catern> which, yes, it would be very cool to have AI formalized in a dependently typed programming language, but that's going to take a really long time...
[08:02:24] <gwern> 'I know, I'll use type theory to solve AGI! now you have an uncountable infinity of higher-order problems'
[08:02:53] <PapuaHardyNet> sounds very Yudkowskian, yeah
[08:03:20] <gwern> tbf yukowsky wasn't suggesting try to teach neural nets about loeb's theorem or smth
[08:04:31] <catern> like, it's appealing to me because I like type theory/proving things about programs, and I disagree with EY's suggestion than it's not useful, but one has to acknowledge that just because it's appealing doesn't make it a viable solution
[08:05:57] <catern> I could use proven-correct programs to, say, demonstrate that a bridge isn't going to fall down, and maybe someday we'll be able to do that, but even that is a hard problem, and it's much easier than friendliness...
[08:06:40] <PlanckWalk> Just plug in the "IsDeceptive" predicate.
[08:06:48] <PlanckWalk> You know, that easy to define one.
[08:06:49] <gwern> (hm... 'some people think, I know, I have ‚Ñµ‚ÇÅ problems in my program proving, I'll add a second-order type system. Now they have ‚Ñµ‚ÇÇ problems.')
[08:06:51] <nshepperd2> you would basically need a second superintelligent ai to prove the friendliness theorems about the first one
[08:07:22] <PlanckWalk> A bigger one :-p
[08:07:30] <rmmh> recursive ai box problem
[08:07:40] <nshepperd2> its not like you can just plug the entire world into your SMT solver
[08:07:41] <gwern> which basically takes you into christiano bootstrapping like paradigms... if you can trade off compute for safety/dumbness
[08:08:08] <gwern> nshepperd2: _Red Sun_ twist: "Why don't you just put the whole world into your SMT solver, Superman?!"
[08:08:09] <catern> well - don't let me misrepresent Omohundro's suggestion - he's not actually proposing solving friendliness, he's proposing something closer to "a bridge isn't going to fall down"
[08:08:15] <gwern> * Son
[08:08:15] <PlanckWalk> There may be plenty of approaches that might work out in a century or two
[08:08:19] <catern> but still, quite hard
[08:09:48] <PlanckWalk> I don't think it would take much less time than that to get interesting result in some new "Formal System Psychology" field
[08:09:51] <nshepperd2> if you built a superintelligent oracle ai and prevented any idiots from getting access to it, there is plausibly a sequence of queries which could solve this and not destroy the world
[08:13:00] <PlanckWalk> With our formal verification to date, we can sometimes prove that some programs in carefully crafted languages don't break some very simple constraints during their runtime.
[08:14:03] <PlanckWalk> Scaling that to anything about overall behaviour of "a program that implements superintelligence" seems ... unlikely.
[08:15:45] <PlanckWalk> Or even just might implement superintelligence in some respect but we really don't know.
[08:16:30] <pompolic> has anyone tried figuring out what the giant inscrutable floating point vectors *mean*
[08:16:51] <pompolic> i mean, in a methodical way
[08:18:35] <PlanckWalk> Yes, but not very successfully
[08:19:37] <gwern> that's chris olah's project, which after half a decade of work, has decoded one or two of them
[08:19:58] <gwern> we can now successfully find parts of VGG which rotate some shapes!
[08:23:14] <nshepperd2> so it still seems like the only viable prospect for friendliness write now is to upload some alignment researchers into a simulated lab, tell them to solve it, and program the AGI to do whatever they tell it to after 100 years of simulated progress
[08:23:17] <pompolic> i see
[08:24:16] <pompolic> i really wish we got uploads before AGI yes
[08:24:21] <nshepperd2> and hope the uploads dont' go crazy from isolation i guess
[08:24:24] <rmmh> gwern: smh, stolen serial killer interviewing valor
[08:25:01] <pompolic> not going crazy from isolation seems like a solvable problem
[08:25:06] <pompolic> t. probably crazy from isolation
[08:28:37] <pompolic> if only you could just download more brain RAM
[08:30:18] <nshepperd2> since it doesn't look like we're going to get uploads any time soon, we'll probably have to make the AGI do the uploading too, which is in itself a massive alignment probelm to specify what that means exactly

[09:45:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like "what if we just design the AGI to not want to manipulate humans"
[09:45:37] <PapuaHardyNet> ouch
[09:45:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> "what if humans are *expecting* trickery, eh? then trickery won't be rewarding, and THUS the AGI won't do it"
[09:46:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I am not strawmanning at all, read the transcript if you don't believe me)
[09:46:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> "It seems highly unlikely to me that you would have a system that appears to follow human requests and human values, and it would suddenly switch at some powerful level. I think there will be signs beforehand. Of course, if the humans are not paying attention, they might miss it. But, say, in the current milieu, I find it plausible that they will pay enough attention." <- actual quote
[09:49:56] <PapuaHardyNet> and these people are lesswrong users?
[09:50:28] <PapuaHardyNet> sad
[09:51:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> We don't know, again
[09:51:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> We have no idea who they are
[09:51:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> One of them could be the Pope, for all we know
[09:51:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> They could *all* be the Pope

[10:01:50] <PapuaHardyNet> AGI is a weapon? interesting.
[10:02:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I didn't conceive of AGI as a weapon. Perhaps because I've only been used to using and reading about narrow AI
[10:02:38] <PapuaHardyNet> GPTX don't count, they aren't very useful "weapons"
[10:02:54] <PapuaHardyNet> honestly, the most powerful non-AGI AI would be an accurate world modeller

[10:12:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> So yeah this convo is just terribly depressing
[10:12:43] <PapuaHardyNet> saturn2: oh yeah, but it's not like you consider ResNet a weapon, right?
[10:12:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol @ the comments, too
[10:13:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "chathamroom.com seems pretty cool!" "I don‚Äôt mean this as a personal attack, but I perceive this comment as being similar to, if you are at a particularly sad funeral service and just finished burying a loved one, proceeding to make a comment like, ‚ÄúHm, maybe I should get some of those flowers for my front yard.‚Äù"
[10:13:11] <PapuaHardyNet> when someone says "AGI is a weapon", it means you can bootstrap from simply one working AGI into becoming the ruler of the universe
[10:13:20] <PapuaHardyNet> (at least in the minds of these people)
[10:15:25] <saturn2> yeah
[10:18:56] <PlanckWalk> AGI is a nuclear hand grenade
[10:20:39] *** Quits: thlnz (~thln@user/thlnz) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[10:20:53] <PlanckWalk> Hmm.  Maybe a better analogy is to also add that old theory about a nuclear bomb igniting the atmosphere.
[10:32:13] <PapuaHardyNet> should we finance anti-AGI terrorism?
[10:33:29] <saturn2> no
[10:34:11] <PlanckWalk> In principle probably yes, but in practice it won't work and will just end up making things very much worse for yourself and a bunch of other people.
[10:34:28] <PlanckWalk> Well, worse in a shorter term.
[10:34:53] <PlanckWalk> I'd much rather fund AGI safety
[10:35:43] <saturn2> if you have to ask whether to finance terrorism in an open irc channel, the answer is always no
[10:35:55] <PlanckWalk> Haha true
[10:38:00] <PlanckWalk> Also it would be "we have to do something, this is something, therefore we should do this"
[10:38:11] <PapuaHardyNet> I imagine that the first AGI to exist would immediately fund anti-AGI terrorism to prevent other AGIs from being born
[10:38:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't do any terrorisms
[10:38:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is illegal and bad
[10:38:49] <PapuaHardyNet> that's correct, we must leave it to the government to do so
[10:38:56] <saturn2> it would be wrong
[10:39:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> When the government does it, it's not illegal ;)
[10:39:56] <PapuaHardyNet> but seriously
[10:40:18] <PapuaHardyNet> the moment an AGI with agency exists, the first thing it will do is start warfare against other AI organizations
[10:41:14] <PapuaHardyNet> oh wait, I'm assuming a drive to survive in the AGI. that is because I'm assuming that for an AGI to accomplish the goal it is trained to do, it will assume that its own existence is paramount
[10:41:21] <PapuaHardyNet> which is a weak assumption imo
[10:44:57] <PlanckWalk> Yep, I have to remind myself that I have no idea what the first AGIs will do first.
[10:45:10] <PlanckWalk> Let alone later, smarter ones
[10:47:07] <PlanckWalk> Well, the first ones will probably do really dumb things.
[10:47:53] <nshepperd2> yes, preventing other AGIs from existing is a very obvious first thing for any AGI to do
[10:48:31] <nshepperd2> no guarantee those other AGIs will care about paperclips after all
[10:48:43] <PapuaHardyNet> hold up, even if we assume that the first few AGIs do dumb things, the *first* AGI that successfully decides to prevent other AGIs from existing is one that shall survive longer
[10:48:49] <PlanckWalk> For all our talk about instrumental goals, I'm not even sure that the first few will be goal driven in any sense.
[10:49:08] <PlanckWalk> But probably pretty soon, one will be.
[10:49:21] <PapuaHardyNet> therefore only the AGIs who decide to defend from nonexistence and try to commit AGI genocide shall exist
[10:49:50] <PapuaHardyNet> what if human deaths will simply be fallout of the AGI wars?
[10:49:57] <PlanckWalk> Humans are AGIs
[10:50:05] <PlanckWalk> Err, GIs
[10:50:13] <PapuaHardyNet> oh
[10:50:39] <PapuaHardyNet> so human organizations shall be acceptable targets for low-level AGis
[10:51:00] <PapuaHardyNet> for AGIs advanced enough, human organizations shouldn't pose enough of a threat compared to other AGIs
[10:51:11] <PapuaHardyNet> so the AGI war theory still stands
[10:52:14] <PlanckWalk> I don't even think that the first N AGIs will self improve.
[10:52:51] <PlanckWalk> But they probably will assist with human efforts to improve them.
[10:53:17] <PlanckWalk> (Even tool AIs will do that)
[10:55:13] <PlanckWalk> So ... no FOOM today.  FOOM tomorrow.  There's always a FOOM tomorrow.  What?   Look, somebody's got to have some damn perspective around here.  FOOM.  Sooner or later ... FOOM!
[10:56:10] <PapuaHardyNet> FOOM eternal
[10:57:11] <PlanckWalk> I don't really buy a multipolar scenario.  Not for any meaningful timescale, at least.
[10:58:21] <PapuaHardyNet> look, I just want an AGI catgirl waifu, I don't really mind what happens after that
[10:59:30] <PlanckWalk> That's fair.

[14:47:46] <feepbot> Contra Scott Alexander's "The Tails Coming Apart as Metaphor for Life" - Alexey Guzey (Happiness Scott Alexander writes:)
[14:47:59] <feep[work]> this is now his title
[14:48:05] <feep[work]> "Happiness Scott Alexander."
[14:48:05] <PapuaHardyNet> thesis: positive emotions (hedons) and sense of meaning (eudaimonia) are inversely correlated
[14:49:06] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: hahahah
[14:51:39] <PapuaHardyNet> lol wait, the point of the article is that guzey proves that scott's argument is incorrect, not that hedons and eudaimonia are inversely correlated
[14:51:41] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: I think this is wrong
[14:51:59] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: for instance, as a kid I went on a hiking trip in france
[14:52:09] <feep[work]> it was sweaty as fuck and I was miserable literally the entire time
[14:52:14] <feep[work]> at the end it started being a bit better
[14:52:19] <feep[work]> didn't feel meaningful for *shit.*
[14:53:15] <feep[work]> I think positive emotions and meaningfulness exist in a weird nontrivial cycle that depends on some derivatives or sth
[14:54:11] <feep[work]> hypothesis: happiness is the derivative of meaningful contribution
[14:54:22] * feep[work] considers amusement parks
[14:54:28] <feep[work]> hypothesis: happiness is, in part, the derivative of meaningful contribution
[14:54:40] <PapuaHardyNet> ignoring guzey's and scott's thesis for a bit; I agree with you, but wouldn't it be better if we could make our statements a bit more precise?
[14:54:54] <feep[work]> sure, but I think it's a thing where
[14:54:56] <feep[work]> like, it's the brain
[14:55:02] <feep[work]> nothing in biology is simple
[14:55:45] <feep[work]> I mean, consider evolution, probably happiness started out as a gradient descent? training signal for behavior
[14:55:48] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, unfortunately. I recall reading this book on depression that said that SSRIs don't work simply by increasing serotonin levels, there's a lot more involved that results in both serotonin levels rising...
[14:55:54] <PapuaHardyNet> and depressive episodes getting less intense
[14:56:25] <feep[work]> and once we got planning, and meaningfulness, that got hooked into the happiness mechanism haphazardly
[14:57:29] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: yeah or like, how with hyperactivity, you can give them stimulants to calm them down
[14:57:53] <feep[work]> (favorite justification: the stimulants boost everything, including whatever in the brain does executive function, and that has superlinear returns)
[14:59:26] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting theory. I think it makes sense too, if you don't have enough dopamine you'll want to do things that spike dopamine. taking a stimulant pulls your resting dopamine levels back up to a normal level
[15:00:43] <feep[work]> yeah

[18:22:13] <pompolic> it's tax + pension + social security

[18:22:32] <two2thehead> lol :V
[18:22:58] <PapuaHardyNet> pensions are a con, yes

[18:24:02] *** Quits: feep[work] (~mathis@217.64.163.97) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:24:22] <pompolic> roughly
[18:24:48] <PapuaHardyNet> I still wouldn't count pension as part of your effective tax tho
[18:25:03] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps we ignore it exists and then redo the ratio
[18:25:06] <pompolic> why not?
[18:25:40] <PapuaHardyNet> well, technically the money is given to you later on right?
[18:26:26] <pompolic> no it isn't, pensions are a con
[18:26:32] <kuudes> ?
[18:26:52] <kuudes> over here we have about 1 year gdp in pension funds
[18:27:06] <kuudes> the employers have to pay pensions the same time as they pay salary
[18:27:25] <kuudes> if they have good credit, they may be able to loan some money of it back for collateral
[18:27:32] <pompolic> the other reasons i can't count on it: a) i don't expect to live long enough b) even if i do, i don't expect to live in that particular country
[18:27:37] <kuudes> but yes, I presume pension funds will exist
[18:27:54] <pompolic> so it's taken out of my salary for no reason
[18:28:26] <kuudes> if there are no mandatory pension payments, then the money will just be burned into moloch races about houses etc
[18:28:40] <pompolic> also re: pensions are a con, the idea, as i understand it, is to make you think you put it in for the state to manage, which it will disburse later
[18:29:06] <kuudes> so it seems to me that given it is constant for everyone, it is actually used for pensions and not for houses or similar where it would just go to inflation
[18:29:07] <pompolic> but in the past 10 years i think there has been at least one scandal wherein the pension money got used for the usual corruption, embezzling and vanity projects
[18:29:38] <kuudes> well sure. which is why we have multiple pension funds and they are checked by the financial inspection
[18:29:45] <pompolic> so: i guess technically it's an IOU based on the state's ability to collect pension money from subsequent marks
[18:29:52] <kuudes> and which is why I am against of "streamlining" pension funds into one large fund
[18:30:00] <pompolic> but that's the other thing, dwindling population
[18:30:03] <kuudes> it is much better when we have 5 funds with ~20% each
[18:30:53] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: you've convinced me, pension is a con
[18:31:08] <kuudes> so when one of them eventually gets corrupted and belly up, the others can manage to pay the pensioneers of the fallen
[18:31:39] <kuudes> over here pension funds are not owned by the state
[18:31:40] <pompolic> i don't feel like this should've been persuasive -- i *know* i'm not communicating the Bayesian evidence i have
[18:31:57] <pompolic> although the thesis is more or less: in my particular case, the pensions are a Ponzi scheme

[18:32:21] <kuudes> and indeed just recently the financial inspection has practically fired 1 ceo of pension fund and blocked one another to be nominated because lack of ability
[18:32:45] <pompolic> i don't have a good awareness of where that money is going, but i don't have grounds to assume that the pension funds are okay

[20:29:02] <pompolic> i know that ASP.NET had something similar
[20:29:07] <catern> not to be too contrarian but I don't think this is that big of a deal - hiding your code is horrible, of course, but whether you do that by locking down a workstation and disabling view source, or by putting the code on a different server that you can only access by network calls... doesn't really matter
[20:29:38] <pompolic> i can't recall exactly, but i think it was pre-filled default elements hidden clientside (the contents were security-related)
[20:30:08] <catern> having a proprietary server which validates the answers on the server-side is not fundamentally different from a locked-down DRM'd-up client - of course, again, obviously I hate both
[20:30:22] <pompolic> in a page i tested, you could brute force an ID, then pull out PII from the page source
[20:30:25] <pompolic> that was fun
[20:31:02] <pompolic> it is fundamentally different in that the latter means whoever wrote the security model is an insane idiot
[20:31:11] <gwern> catern: having a separate server is the right answer for the same reason services don't just ship down their entire password database and ask you to politely check whether you have permission to access the service, scout's honor

[20:33:19] <catern> fundamentally, there's nothing inherent about a so-called "separate server" that makes it the inherently Correct place to put your security boundaries
[20:33:38] <catern> especially in the world of The Cloud where there aren't actually separate servers
[20:33:42] <pompolic> just because you can run arbitrary code on the client, it can be attacked from a layer below by a resourceful user
[20:33:49] <gwern> pompolic: I mean, it's testing. of course the user is the adversary. if you don't test, people don't suddenly become angels. they will continue to lie and self-deceive and be ignorant, and not testing simply punts the ball. would you hand out a MD to anyone who walks in the door and looks earnest and says they're good at doctoring?
[20:34:29] <catern> (well you could conceive of other ways to test which aren't vulnerable to this - things which are in NP, rather than P, so to speak)
[20:35:09] <gwern> a 'separate server' is what security *means*. it *means* encapsulation and barriers and opacity
[20:35:13] <pompolic> gwern: yeah, it's a fair point. i guess i'm being way too hyperbolic
[20:35:32] <pompolic> it's well and right for a test framework to treat the user as a potential adversary in the security model
[20:36:01] <pompolic> in fact, if the answers are sent to clientside, their very problem is that they don't
[20:36:07] <gwern> the difference between two cells is the membrane encapsulating them and preventing one from affecting the state of the other. if they didn't have the membrane, it would just be one cell

[20:37:43] <catern> gwern: the physical analogy is confusing, because while something physically separate has some barrier between it and other things, a so-called separate server might only be separate by software. compare two processes or VMs on Unix, or a closure in Haskell - they provide a security boundary with no physical separation

[20:40:43] <catern> gwern: sure, but as you suggest even in your reply - things could be arranged otherwise. chrome could run on a secure enclave - that's the conceit of DRM - heck, the test software could use the exact same techniques netflix does to secure itself

[20:41:43] <gwern> my response would be more like 'ok, that's kinda weird, wouldn't it be easier to just run a normal quizz? you're assuming online access, right?" but I wouldn't actually be angry
[20:42:05] <gwern> because locking down 'view source' is *not* an actual security strategy in the way an enclave actually is
[20:42:06] <catern> they're both vulnerable to physical attacks, and only resilient inasmuch as the software running on them is resilient
