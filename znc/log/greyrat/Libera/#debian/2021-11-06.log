[10:43:17] <mekilladi> tomreyn: bro i just solved the issue :)
[10:44:20] <tomreyn> maybe you solved the apt key issue, by importing the keys, but the system will still have been runnig outdated + insecure software for this past year - if this is really jessie
[10:44:47] <tomreyn> cat /etc/debian_version /proc/version     may tell

[10:46:20] <mekilladi> tomreyn: i really don't know
[10:47:38] <tomreyn> well, you should really make sure this is not a jessie system, if you intend to keep it running.

[20:47:37] <johnjay> i don't think i modified sources.list before now so i have those
[20:47:39] <jkc> RonWhoCares: No idea why people are telling you not to use RSA. RSA is fine.
[20:47:52] <RonWhoCares> Okay
[20:47:55] <johnjay> but my system clock was set to last month and it refused to update since bullseye wasn't out yet
[20:48:00] <jkc> The keys are big, but its as secure as the alternatives with appropriate key sizes.
[20:48:13] <jkc> A key size of 3072 or 4096 is recommended.

[20:51:09] <xx> jkc: it's fine, except that openssh is gradually removing it and will eventually kill plain rsa as well

[20:51:37] <johnjay> sney: looking closer. it says that bullseye security and updates are not valid for another 32 days
[20:51:42] <Khepra> RSA is deprecated in openssh
[20:51:54] <johnjay> and "Updates from this repository will not be applied."
[20:52:03] <jkc> no, it is not. The mechanism that uses RSA *and* SHA1 is. RSA as a key is not deprecated.
[20:52:12] <Khepra> actually it is

[20:52:55] <sney> johnjay: ok, you definitely have some kind of clock problem. if you can't get systemd-timesyncd (or other ntp approach) to keep your clock current, there's likely to be some hardware issue. battery, etc
[20:53:24] <johnjay> yes the clock date was set to a month ago. so i had to run hwclock since it's a VM
[20:53:47] <jkc> I suggest you take a careful read of RFC 8332 and observe the portions where RSA with SHA2 are listed as RECOMMENDED.
[20:53:50] <johnjay> what i wasn't sure is why it was saying 11.0 was updated and security couldn't be applied yet. but it sounds like 11.1 wraps up those security patches at a certain date
[20:54:48] <jkc> So, no. RSA as a client authentication key algorithm is not deprecated.

[23:19:16] <jason1234> besiudes why should third party companies should host the CDROM CD-1 of debian ? the archive has only netbinstall. please keep CD isos as well into your hosting !
[23:19:25] <amacater_> jason1234: It's complicated - the single CD install no longer fits on a CD.There are (relatively) few machines that now need a physical CD size medium to boot from. Most drives can now read a DVD - use DVD1. If you can boot from USB, that can be written to USB
[23:20:00] <jason1234> If archive.org is not there, there is NOT DEBIAN , debian history is then dead
[23:20:23] <jason1234> bit like Unix version 1 and 2 !! we didnt get disks and all was wasted
[23:21:10] <jason1234> please guys, keep on preservation ofd debian. please  host as well the cd-1 and dvd of debian, each version , especially the >1, 2, lö...

[23:21:53] <jason1234> if the russians or .. bombs US, then you have no archive.org and no backups.
[23:21:54] <amacater_> We've tried hard to do that: for the earliest releases of Debian, CDs were uncommon but we have physical media.
[23:22:18] <amacater_> cdimage.debian.org keeps an archive and that's duplicated elsewhere too
[23:22:19] <jkc> jason1234: You're asking for people to expend resources for old software that in some cases may not even boot on modern systems, simply for historical funsies. That's a pretty lopsided perspective.

[23:41:30] <jason1234> I cannot do your work all the time.

[23:43:45] <gordonfish> Otherwise you can get other isos by way of following the directions in https://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/
[23:43:50] <jkc> jason1234: I have. I use it. It's easy. It's simple.
[23:43:55] <randall> jason1234: Nobody asked you to mirror those files on archive.org, assuming you even maintain that site in the first place.
[23:44:09] <gordonfish> "ownload a package containing jigdo-lite. This is available directly for installation in the Debian and Ubuntu distributions in the jigdo-file package. For FreeBSD, install from /usr/ports/net-p2p/jigdo or grab the package with pkg_add -r jigdo. For other installation options (binaries for Windows, source), check the the jigdo homepage."

[23:45:49] <jkc> I can't tell at this point if you're SO obtuse that you've just become a full circle, or if you're being obstinate and combative because you enjoy it.

[23:47:07] <gordonfish> jkc: Yes that too, was going to suggest just getting the sources, which shouldn't be a problem to build on most any flavor of BSD with a half-compitent tool chain
