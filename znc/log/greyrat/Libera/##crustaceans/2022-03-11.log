[06:08:44] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: oof
[06:10:59] <kline> does anyone have particular expertise in linux's networking? i have a wireguard interface on a server with two clients that im trying to route between. i expected to have to turn on the sysctl net.ipv6.conf.gemini.forwarding=1 (gemini being the interface) but this didnt work, i had to use ..all.forwarding=1 instead. weirdly, turning on ..{enp1s0,lo,gemini}.forwarding=1 didnt matter even
[06:10:59] <kline> though i expected that would be the same as all
[06:11:51] <kline> i would really like to enable forwarding on only for the wireguard interface and not all, unless i can understand why this is required and how to mitigate any security/good networking practice implications it has
[06:13:33] *** Joins: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy)
[06:16:06] <defect> https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+IPv6-HOWTO/ch11s02.html - sounds like per-interface forwarding isn't really a thing
[06:16:07] <buttsbot> 2. Entries in /proc/sys/net/ipv6/
[06:16:54] <defect> and that kind of filtering should go in netfilter/iptables/nftables
[06:20:04] <kline> cool
[06:20:09] <kline> thats annoying
[06:21:34] <ngoldbaum> ^ unofficial motto of linux networking
[06:21:54] <kline> "mixed router/host scenarios are rather uncommon" might be true but that doesnt mean that its universal. i expect there are a lot of places that have management VPNs that link hosts together but dont want the server at the hub to also be a router for its live interfaces to the internet
[06:25:48] <kline> OH WELL, thanks
[07:07:19] <Church> Heh
[07:07:55] <Church> kline: So what traffic are you trying to forward over wg?
[07:10:11] <kline> i just want all my devices to be on a shared network
[07:10:25] <kline> the networking situation where i live is super fucked
[07:11:27] <kline> (i live in company housing where the only ISP delivers their services via captive portals, your account is mac-locked to only authorise 2 devices, and everyone gets their own vlan)
[07:12:29] <Church> Right think I remember this
[07:12:34] <kline> i was thinking about getting a little "network in a box" thing that was like a 2U unit of 1U switch and a 1U server that did DHCP+NAT+NAS, so everything could appear "behind" that, but this is different
[07:12:51] <Church> kline: Could tailscale your problems away?
[07:12:55] <kline> this is just me fiddling with wireguard because why not, and thought itd be nice if i could have everything in one place
[07:13:13] <Church> It does what you want well with out the fiddling with wg bits
[07:13:16] <kline> probably, but thats no fun compared to diy
[07:13:47] <kline> theres absolutely no reason why i _need_ to be able to ssh from my phone to my laptop, i just thought itd be worth learning
[07:13:54] <Church> Aye fair.
[07:14:11] <Church> Let me think on and remember how to do this properly, I've done so before.
[07:14:43] <kline> the internet in a box thing would solve real problems like having more than pick-two-of-n devices that i own connected to the internet at a time, but thats nothing to do with this
[07:15:31] <kline> as it stands if i need to turn on my little lab machine i need to de-authorise my phone from my account and use cell internet and then authorise my other device, and vice versa when im done
[07:16:06] <kline> it would be nice to have a 2U unit with switch and wifi that was its own home network and natted it all to appear as a single device to the ISP wifi
[07:16:54] <kline> thats easy done and ive done a very rough and ready version with my laptop and desk switch in the past
[07:17:47] <kline> (when i was installing debian on my lab machine it needed a connection to the internet but didnt have wifi nor the means to negotiate the captive portal so i natted it through my laptop with ethernet)
[07:18:19] <kline> (i decided id take the opportunity to pxe boot the debian install image as well since i was already doing half the job)
[07:33:29] <Xe> gwozniak: with how fucking horrible things have been going lately, thoughts of a peaceful afterlife resonate a lot with people
[07:34:20] <companion_cube> that's not christians though
[07:34:33] <companion_cube> they think of hellfire and eternal torture
[07:34:52] <Xe> not for them though
[07:35:08] <Xe> eternal paradise
[07:35:10] <Xe> with a side of worshipping yahweh for all of eternity
[07:35:24] <Xe> if the drug trip is to be taken literally that is
[07:36:19] <Xe> ironically the real facist religion is evangelicalism
[07:58:05] <kline> i read about jehovans witnesses the other day, apparently when judgement day comes they believe that 144k of the best people to have lived will go to heaven, the rest of the good people will live on a paradise earth as immortals, and everyone else just stays dead
[07:58:56] <kline> this is a nice sounding outcome but in the meantime they refuse to enjoy life and you're not allowed to use modern medicine, so im not very convinced it works out for me individually
[07:59:48] <companion_cube> sounds like it doesn't change anything for me
[07:59:51] <companion_cube> I'd take that over hell
[08:01:32] <ngoldbaum> the shitty end of pascalâ€™s wager
[08:04:20] <kline> yeah, i dont really subscribe to religions but i dont really hold it against anyone if they do as long as theyre not dicks about it
[08:04:47] <kline> just live a good life and if thats not good enough for whatever god there is, you never stood much of a chance anyway
[08:05:18] <companion_cube> far too reasonable
[08:05:28] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: pascal's wager, aka the false dichotomy :D
[08:06:12] <kline> pascals wager is just antique rokos basilisk
[08:07:00] <kline> rokos basilisk is uniquely better than pascals wager, however, in that it causes a lot of hoity toity people to have meltdowns
