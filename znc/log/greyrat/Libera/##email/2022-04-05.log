[18:05:39] <foo> I used mailgun.com to send 500 emails. They're ending up in promotions. We have an Outlook system here, I'm thinking about sending email through Outlook's SMTP servers to minimize the chance of ending in promotion. This is not spam. For context, we're talking an "email blast" being 500 emails... maybe once or twice a month. 3 times a max. Can I reasonably assume if I send via Outlook, and not Mailgun, we have 
[18:05:45] <foo> a higher chance of not ending up in Promotions tab? The other option is to use Outlook's mail merge feature... but that might be the same as sending via SMTP 
[18:05:48] <foo> (from outlook) 
[18:08:22] <Khepra> wha tis "promotions" tab
[18:08:41] <Khepra> What is "Promotions tab"     .... tpyos be damned.
[18:09:20] <bremner> a gmail thing, I bet
[18:09:24] <Friithian> tpyos lol
[18:09:37] <bremner> TP-YOLO
[18:16:39] <lunaphyte> foo: why is it not spam?
[18:17:17] <foo> Khepra: whoops, in Gmail.
[18:17:33] <foo> lunaphyte: It's a government program people have opted into.
[18:17:41] <lunaphyte> have all recipients performed confirmed opt-in?
[18:18:05] <foo> lunaphyte: That would be nice, but no. People fill out emails on paper forms. 
[18:18:09] <foo> I realize that's ideal...
[18:18:44] <foo> Our options for sending mail: A) mailgun, B) outlook mail merge C) outlook's smtp servers. I'm trying to get the highest success rate. 
[18:18:57] <Khepra> but have they checked, on the paper forms, that they agree to be emailed about things you're mailing them with
[18:19:35] <foo> Khepra: Yes. It's in their best interest to receive this email. They're literally getting thousands of dollars of work done for free because of a city initiative. 
[18:19:45] <foo> I understand every person in the world who sends email probably says "it's in their best interest" 
[18:19:51] <foo> heh
[18:19:52] *** Quits: Giovanni (~Giovanni@176.54.209.228) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[18:20:16] <foo> Mailgun has proper DKIM / SPF / etc set up, I've already been through this here.
[18:20:23] <foo> But I think it's hitting promotions tab
[18:20:37] <Khepra> sounds like it IS promotion
[18:20:39] <foo> Which might be limiting exposure. I saw noticed this with 3 test emails to different accounts
[18:21:15] <Khepra> meanwhile, I think the only people who can say what goes under Promotions tab in gmail are the gmail AI trainers.
[18:21:33] <foo> Khepra: that's what I'm thinking too. I may have to do some tests with outlook and see for myself.
[18:21:58] <foo> I like to think mailgun's reputation of, generally being a promotion-based-email-blasting-platform doesn't help me.
[18:22:01] <lunaphyte> to answer your initial question : "Can I reasonably assume if I send via Outlook, and not Mailgun, we have a higher chance of not ending up in Promotions tab?" - i'd suggest it wouldn't be wise to assume that, no
[18:22:13] <Khepra> I wouldn't rely too much on those tests. GMail sometimes does one thing, another time does another thing....
[18:22:25] <foo> Khepra: thanks for verifying, yes that's what I've seen to
[18:22:35] <foo> lunaphyte: thank you for sharing
[18:22:43] <foo> My sense is we're going to need door knockers to get the word out... heh.
[18:22:47] <foo> (which we have)
[18:22:50] <Khepra> sharing is caring.
[18:22:52] <foo> I was simply trying to help out on the email front
[18:23:09] <foo> Khepra: in wild wild west email land, yes, yes, it is. This channel is my therapy. 
[18:23:12] <foo> :) 
[18:23:20] * foo hugs channel ... with a mas
[18:23:21] <foo> k
[18:23:22] <foo> heh
[18:23:26] <lunaphyte> i will say that in the long run, you might have better luck handling your own email.  it comes at a cost, of course
[18:23:59] <foo> lunaphyte: I wish we had resources for that, heh. I'm not opposed to that, though. What mail server you running these days? My postfix skills are a bit rusty.
[18:24:04] <lunaphyte> but at least your reputation will be your reputation, and not mailgun's, or microsoft's, or whoever
[18:24:09] <foo> agree
[18:24:33] <lunaphyte> i use postfix
[18:24:36] <foo> At that point, though, I'd likely just send out paper mailers - before mail server. And gauge success rate of that
[18:24:47] <foo> lunaphyte: cool, glad to hear it's still "going strong"

[21:56:51] <pj> Well gmail is a black box so I certainly can't say how they work out what a promotion is but they could do it by simply looking for messages to different recipients that are the same over a certain threshold of recipients.  They probably also take ip reputation into account though. 
[21:59:31] <pj> But do look at the headers of one of the received messages to see if anything stands out.  It is possible that mailgun is actually setting a header that explicitly tells Gmail it's promotional.
