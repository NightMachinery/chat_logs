[03:44:44] <Janet> ^ A mukbang or meokbang), also known as an eating show, is an online audiovisual broadcast in which a host consumes various quantities of food while interacting with the audience. It became popular in South Korea in 2010, and since then...

[13:48:57] <dayday> Live DJ- and rap shows.
[13:49:19] <dayday> Tight security from both the police and the country's most feared jailbirds.
[13:49:30] <sublim20> this sounds awesome
[13:49:45] <dayday> And not to mention, hordes upon hordes of beautiful women.
[13:49:58] <dayday> sublim20: You can come too.
[13:50:19] <dayday> The party is going to last for weeks non-stop.
[13:50:23] <sublim20> not a european though, american.  :(
