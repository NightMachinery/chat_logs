[01:56:25] <ImoutoBot> [youtube] Original PlayStation Startup Intro (PS1)(PSX) | Duration: 23 seconds
[02:04:55] <Nanobot> At my old job, we were looking to hire two Java programmers. We held interviews, and there was one person who applied to both positions, so we interviewed her twice (kinda weird, but that's how the hiring process was structured). She didn't have any programming experience, but she claimed to know some database stuff and proudly emphasized that she was a computer science professor in the country she came from. But, she couldn't answer basic programming 
[02:04:56] <Nanobot> questions, and even her database knowledge amounted to Excel and entry-level Microsoft SQL. After the second interview, when it was obvious from the tone that she wasn't getting the job, she began acting defensive. She asked if there's some *reason* we were rejecting her. I was about to respond that we just really need someone with Java experience, but my boss stopped me and offered this explanation instead: "We just don't think you're a good fit for us. 
[02:04:56] <Nanobot> You just don't fit in."
[02:06:36] <Nanobot> I remember immediately thinking, "That's, like, just about the worst thing you could have said."

[02:10:41] <Jigsy> "We're dropping you faster than a table."
[02:11:56] <Nanobot> I mean, she clearly had it in her mind that we were discriminating against her based on her ethnicity, gender, or age. My boss' response must have sounded like a 100% confirmation of that, even though it was really just about the Java thing.

[02:14:27] <Jigsy> I don't understand why people think they need to be hired based on their race or what they have between their legs.

[02:21:51] <klaxa> yo that's hatespeech
[02:21:58] <klaxa> :^)
[02:24:06] <Jigsy> How in the hell is that hate speech?
[02:24:25] <Jigsy> I'm with Nanobot. People should be hired based on how well they can do a job.
[02:25:49] <ButterNoodle> yea I don't hire for blowjobs based on age, sex, race, religion, or nationality.. it's call a blow job because its work ffs...
[02:26:47] <Nanobot> I mean, I think she felt like we were *rejecting* her because of her race/etc. The impression I got is that she felt like she was successful in the country she came from, but suddenly can't find success here, and rationalizes it as being discriminated against.
[02:27:18] <Jigsy> I get the feeling everyone does that these days...
[02:27:29] <Jigsy> Just git gud at work kids, and you'll be fine.
[02:27:43] * Jigsy said ironically being unemployed.
[02:27:49] <ButterNoodle> git gud, or know someone on the inside..
[02:28:41] <ButterNoodle> 2 of the past 3 jobs I have had were only offered because I knew someone that worked there
[02:29:48] <Jigsy> Could you do the job, though?
[02:29:51] <ButterNoodle> now that I think about it.. almost all my jobs were like that but maybe 2
[02:29:57] <ButterNoodle> Jigsy: for sure
[02:30:02] <Jigsy> Then it's no problem. :D
[02:30:12] <klaxa> Jigsy: there is nevertheless a bias to hire based on gender
[02:30:19] <klaxa> it's hard to get that out of people
[02:30:22] <ButterNoodle> on the other side.. many people are passed over with skills for the job.. just because they are unknown
[02:30:26] <Jigsy> klaxa: Yeah, and it's stupid.
[02:30:32] <klaxa> it's biology though
[02:30:35] <Jigsy> Diversity quotas or whatever are stupid.
[02:30:36] <klaxa> good luck changing your biology
[02:30:44] <ButterNoodle> klaxa I never had a problem hiring women..
[02:30:53] <Jigsy> At least for employment.
[02:30:54] <klaxa> anecdotal evidence
[02:30:58] <ButterNoodle> I did have a problem after hiring them with scheduling
[02:31:18] <Jigsy> It shouldn't matter if they're black, female, an alien, whatever as long as they can do the job.
[02:31:24] <klaxa> amazon did a big machine learning thing to speed up their hiring process
[02:31:37] <klaxa> in the end the AI just threw out everyone who wasn't a white male
[02:31:52] <klaxa> yes it shouldn't matter
[02:31:54] <klaxa> yet it does
[02:32:22] <klaxa> it's almost as if life is full of contradictions ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[02:32:23] <ButterNoodle> I had to put them on shifts opposite of the racist-misogynistic engineers from the 60s that thought it was amazing how other races were walking on the same sidewalk as white people and women were let out of the house
[02:32:42] <ButterNoodle> was a pita to keep HR moments from happening
[02:33:50] <ButterNoodle> unfortunately if u were a old white man, you got to keep ur job unless u brought down a datacenter while under the influence...
[02:34:11] <ButterNoodle> there is no unfuck button for that

[04:50:00] <Nanobot> I decided to try doing a Minecraft hardcore RTA. Started off well. Used a random seed, got into the nether in under 5 minutes, there was a nether fortress like 10 blocks away from where I entered the nether... took care of a couple of blazes in the first hallway... Then, I went to mine a block, and just as I clicked, a zombie piglin drop in from a hole in the ceiling and got hit. I survived, but now I'm hiding in a wall and every zombie piglin in the 
[04:50:01] <Nanobot> fortress is angry at me.
[04:57:20] <Arcorann> Have you tried one before?
[04:57:35] <Nanobot> This was my first time.

[07:49:47] <DunceCotus> it does seem like we are under a dome
[07:49:52] <hassoon> DunceCotus: anyway, the fact that you live on a balln that spinns and moves around in the same time at insane speeds, in an endless space/void is a joke, but on top of that, you've been deceived, whatever you see about space travels or mars landing jokes is copplete CGI, no real footage nothing real
[07:49:53] <DunceCotus> sky is some kind of projection or image
[07:50:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus then how is the sun hot
[07:50:26] <DunceCotus> hassoon: its not entirely CGI but they do film it on Earth likely

[07:51:06] <DunceCotus> I think what is meant by 'waters above' is actually not H2O but is a plasmic medium
[07:51:14] <DunceCotus> the heat of the sun is from this plasmic medium

[08:11:43] <DunceCotus> they didn't really have toilets or plumbing.. but not cause they couldn't make those things
[08:12:16] <DunceCotus> its more complicated. They were so much more advanced than our history books suggest
[08:12:41] <DunceCotus> look at those old 'churches' or temples, and tell me they were made by people with 0 sanitation

[17:49:36] <MootPoot> hmm
[17:49:40] <MootPoot> maybe I should stop
[17:49:43] <MootPoot> and play games
[17:49:44] <MootPoot> for now
[17:49:45] <JesseDesu> no
[17:49:49] <JesseDesu> watch more
[17:49:50] <MootPoot> I already watched like
[17:49:56] <MootPoot> 8 eps of another anime
[17:49:59] <MootPoot> actually no
[17:50:06] <JesseDesu> lol
[17:50:09] <MootPoot> In this one sitting I watched like
[17:50:25] <MootPoot> 4+8+2+4 episodes
[17:50:27] <MootPoot> how much is that
[17:50:32] <JesseDesu> 16
[17:50:34] <MootPoot> yes
[17:50:38] <JesseDesu> wait
[17:50:42] <JesseDesu> 18
[17:50:46] <JesseDesu> rofl
[17:50:54] <JesseDesu> you tricked my eyes
[17:50:59] <MootPoot> I had to take a break to nut in the middle
[17:51:03] <MootPoot> since there was a nice scene
[17:51:35] <JesseDesu> thats what A-B replay is for
[17:53:16] <vegii> Sadale: So now when shipping to EU, you're gonna have to put IOSS number on the package, and to get the IOSS number you need an EU established intermediary... If you don't do that, the buyer will be asked to pay tax locally, plus a handling fee which varies from country to country, here it's 5‚Ç¨+tax for small stuff. And it looks like it's the seller's responsibility to handle buyer's tax, so I might get refunds for the aliexpreess stuff.

[18:26:30] <vegii> I have no idea where that is
[18:27:07] <Cryowolf> its a shame its in China (not because of my opinion of China, not this time) cause Sweden has added a charge to each shipping from there. The charge is the same no matter how much value the product you're buying has (about 20 euro)
[18:27:09] <vegii> Shenzhen
[18:27:22] <Cryowolf> 20 euro per shipment
[18:27:31] <Sadale> vegii, yep. Shenzhen.
[18:27:38] <Cryowolf> and then all our regular charges
[18:28:20] <vegii> welp, wasn't far off
[18:28:26] <Sadale> anyway that's probably USD.

[18:46:35] <Cryowolf> most stuff on aliexpress end up costing the same as in Sweden when I click that I live in Sweden...I guess they add all VAT etc

[21:53:13] <MootPoot> upto 1km
[21:53:47] <vegii> ok, even a toy telescope might do that but better buy something that's not a toy or you'll definitely buy twice
[21:54:25] <MootPoot> hmm
[21:54:29] <MootPoot> something that can spot like
[21:54:46] <MootPoot> 2cm holes on paper from upto 1km away
[21:54:51] <MootPoot> how much zoom would I need for that
[21:55:09] <vegii> oh, so not just seeing if a beer can is standing or not
[21:55:30] <vegii> dunno, find someone who's into astronomy and invite them over
[21:55:47] <JesseDesu> the gunsight telescopes on an AH-64 can read the headlines of a newspaper from 5 miles away
[21:56:07] <MootPoot> are remote wifi battery powered cameras a thing
[21:56:13] <MootPoot> I could just set it up in a safe spot
[21:56:20] <vegii> why wifi tho
[21:56:29] <MootPoot> then even 7-10x would be enough zoom
[21:56:40] <MootPoot> vegii:  idk, its cheap 
[21:56:46] <vegii> so you have your own shooting range?

[23:03:28] <emmeka> it spends more time focusing on the MC himself's development and the stories of each of the characters, though. not a lot has actually been explained so far.
[23:04:14] <Cryowolf> that sounds boring as hell

[23:11:27] <Berlin36> emmeka, im big pp genius 
[23:11:33] <emmeka> Berlin36 mint flowers are fine for tea, you should pick your mint when in full bloom, that's when the essential oils are at their highest levels.

[23:12:11] <emmeka> Berlin36 ....
[23:12:14] <emmeka> why did you do that?

[23:21:28] <Berlin36> emmeka, welp i think there is no reason
[23:21:33] <emmeka> Cryowolf yes, he did this intentionally, which is pretty unacceptable.
[23:21:58] <ButterNoodle> remember that one time that I dropped an irrelevant comment about a small detail from a show and two cucks virtue signaled ops for a show they werent even watching..
[23:22:01] <Cryowolf> yeah I agree, a mistake is one thing but

[23:22:37] <Berlin36> i won't, and i'm sorry
[23:22:53] <ButterNoodle> not a fucking thing.. I waited 6 months later and called ops on one of them for blatant spoilers and shit talked them
[23:23:37] <ButterNoodle> anyway
[23:23:38] <Cryowolf> eh I'm concerned I'm gonna get spoiled any time now
[23:23:41] <emmeka> ButterNoodle I mean there's dropping spoilers in the course of a convo which just happens sometimes and it's not a huge deal... and then there's intentionally reposting something that was spoiler tagged just to troll the channel

[23:25:10] <SpiritOfSummer> to be honest I'm only just now realizing that I regularly post videos of peak action points in shows I've seen without giving a spoiler warning
[23:25:20] <SpiritOfSummer> I'm gonna start doing that
[23:25:36] <ButterNoodle> SpiritOfSummer: yea but you can infer spoiler from the title
[23:25:50] <SpiritOfSummer> true
[23:26:00] <emmeka> SpiritOfSummer it's advisable, but I mean I'm not going to go op on someone just for not adequately tagging/hiding spoilers, it happens.
[23:26:05] <ButterNoodle> unless it says 1,1 watch subaru give birth in the series finale of re:zero

[23:39:29] <Guest42> Hi everyone
[23:42:14] <emmeka> SpiritOfSummer mangadex is pretty good, they only host fan translations and take down any rips of official releases, and they credit fan translators and give them control of their content.
[23:42:48] <emmeka> they just revamped their website after a breach so everything isn't 100% functional right now, but it's still pretty much the best
[23:43:01] <Guest42> Thoughts on DBZ?

[23:43:07] <SpiritOfSummer> Guest42: godly
[23:43:13] <SpiritOfSummer> childhood favorite
[23:43:30] <Guest42> nice
[23:43:50] <SpiritOfSummer> the dragon ball z run with faulconer on the music, minus the filler and nonsense, is divinity to me. 
[23:44:33] <SpiritOfSummer> with the exception of highly outdated animation, dragon ball z is long, drawn out action, with mass amounts of power being tossed around, precisely what I love to see in anime. 
[23:44:54] <SpiritOfSummer> emmeka: thanks
[23:45:14] <Guest42> Are you also a fan of DragonBall Super?
[23:46:00] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah, I have nitpicks about it but in general I like it
[23:46:05] <SpiritOfSummer> especially the last 2 arcs
[23:46:31] <Guest42> Even DBS Broly?
[23:46:36] <SpiritOfSummer> especially that
[23:47:03] <SpiritOfSummer> you basically just listed what I would recommend to somebody as the best dragon ball content
[23:47:06] <lastonestanding> is Broly still stronger than Goku?
[23:47:22] <SpiritOfSummer> lastonestanding: I can't speak for where the manga is, the story has advanced, 
[23:47:35] <SpiritOfSummer> but in the movie, yes, broly is quite a bit stronger than goku, vegeta and frieza.
[23:48:03] <SpiritOfSummer> I won't spoil any of the cooler details
[23:48:07] <lastonestanding> that was long ago though

[23:49:08] <Guest42> At least for me
[23:49:25] <SpiritOfSummer> but the cooler movies are a case where the movies are good enough to where I kind of add them to my own personal official timeline

[23:58:09] <hassoon> except the super sayan ones
[23:58:20] <SpiritOfSummer> but yeah I like the chapters of fighting buu, it's a complete exhaustion of everything the show could possibly offer to try and stop a villain that is just so insanely capable
[23:58:46] <SpiritOfSummer> without any dragon ball super being thought of yet, the buu arc of dragon ball z was a good peak
