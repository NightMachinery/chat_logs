[13:43:23] <peutri> konubinix: you got me thinking, I'll try with urn:
[13:44:10] <peutri> if I can only remember which node it wasâ€¦
[13:44:57] <peutri> well at least now I know *I*'m in the right
[13:48:50] <peutri> the org-link-parameters/org-link-set-parameters does work, so for now that'll fix it thanks
[13:49:26] <peutri> on a more philosophical ground, *why* would roam_ref have to be a *link*?
