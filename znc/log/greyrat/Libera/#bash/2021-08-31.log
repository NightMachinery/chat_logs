[00:05:05] <birkoff> what is the usage scope for awk then ? 
[00:05:19] <earnestly> One-liners, according to BWK
[00:05:33] <greycat> perl is what happens when you throw sed, awk and sh into a pit full of radioacitve spiders
[00:05:34] <birkoff> well that's why I think the best solution would invole the shell being more flexible

[00:14:53] <emanuele6> "why does the guy who puts the K in AWK opinion over AWK matter"?
[00:15:26] <birkoff> earnestly: in zsh multiple process substition order seems like what I said: <<() FIFO, >() FILO  
[00:15:50] <birkoff> i.e. this command:   zsh$ echo one | tee >(echo "4) Counted $(wc -l) lines" )  <<( echo "---one---")  >(echo "3) Total Unique: $(sort|uniq|wc -l)" )  >(echo "2) $(wc -l)")    <<(echo "---two---")   >(echo "1) $(wc -l)")    <<(echo "---three---")

[00:16:41] <earnestly> I always get a giggle out of cliched phrases such as 'apples and oranges', as if two fruits of similar size cannot be compared
[00:16:42] <birkoff> greycat: the more we interact the less I grow fond of cats
[00:17:04] <birkoff> moreso, they can be eaten together
[00:17:23] <birkoff> but the apple cannot tell the orange what it tastes like, nor the other way around
[00:18:01] <earnestly> Talking fruit
[00:18:06] <birkoff> so, I wonder what the order is in bash
[00:18:28] <emanuele6> the order is decided by tee, not bash

[15:03:45] <grondilu> isn't there a way to specify 'infinite' width for fmt?   Or to do it in pure bash?   I thought `echo "$(cat)"` would work but apparently not.
[15:04:41] <grondilu> I guess I could use tr maybe
[15:05:51] <koollman> I'm not sure what you're trying to do
[15:06:28] <grondilu> trying to turn several lines in stdin to just one in stdout
[15:07:21] <grondilu> tr '\n' ' ' would kind of work but it can turn the last \n into a space too

[17:28:56] <Soliton> the sub call removes the first 48 characters if your awk ERE work that way.

[17:29:14] <oldgalileo> `awk '!seen[$0]++ && !/\/$/ {print substr($0,49)}'` this works like a charm!
[17:29:23] <oldgalileo> Thanks! 
[17:29:32] <earnestly> oldgalileo: If you are on linux there exists the man-pages project which has `man 1p awk'.  The POSIX manuals are much better references than GNU versions

[17:30:22] *** Joins: ws2k3 (znc@vps.freegamehosting.eu)
[17:30:53] <ws2k3> why do bash script allways start with #!/bin/bash what does this line exacly do? 
[17:30:54] <Soliton> they'll probably claim that your awk does POSIX ERE and then it doesn't in reality.
[17:31:04] <Soliton> !shebang
[17:31:04] <greybot> The top of a script MUST have a #! line, called 'shebang' or 'hashbang'. It tells the kernel what program to run your script with. We recommend `#!/usr/bin/env bash` (why: http://stackoverflow.com/a/733901/58803). http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/CommandsAndArguments#Scripts http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/
[17:32:19] <ws2k3> Soliton: thank you that kinda clears it up. then you Maby also know the answer to this one. i have a python script that starts with #!/usr/bin/python3 but at my system python is located at /usr/local/bin/python3 does that mean the shebang is wrong? or how should i handle such a situation?
[17:32:31] *** Joins: frostwork (~frostwork@user/frostwork)
[17:33:05] <Soliton> if the path doesn't fit for your system it's not going to work.
[17:33:24] <Soliton> surely some python channel can suggest a suitable shebang.

[22:51:50] <emanuele6> yeah, but posix doesn't have -delete so... :)
[22:54:21] <earnestly> Yeah obviously that'd be replaced with -exec rm ...

[23:02:21] <emanuele6> uniq(1)?
[23:02:41] <mago> uniq(1) file.txt ?
[23:02:54] <earnestly> uniq doesn't sort.  The (1) is a manpage section

[23:03:06] <earnestly> mago: Do you read the manuals and try these things?
[23:03:12] <emanuele6> it's not clear what you mean
[23:03:22] <Helmholtz> earnestly, what could be a easy logic to chop that `https://api.github.com/repos`
[23:03:27] <emanuele6> do you want to sort the lines or group similar lines together?

[23:05:40] <mago> earnestly uniq(1) gives error..
[23:05:40] <earnestly> You can probably use ${/} in bash as you did, just don't quote the urls
[23:06:06] <earnestly> mago: (1) is manual section notation
[23:06:07] <emanuele6> (1) means that it is an external command
[23:06:21] <emanuele6> it's just a way to say that when you type
[23:06:25] <earnestly> mago: You'd know this because manuals reference other commands in such a manner all the time
[23:06:31] <emanuele6> you use it like sort
