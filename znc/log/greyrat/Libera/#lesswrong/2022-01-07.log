[00:01:30] <kuudes> but that was not the case re "<ggreer> he got covid and recovered so he's not a risk compared to a vaccinated person. it's just australia being australia"
[00:01:42] <kuudes> afaik he has not got any vaccine, but is relying only on past infections
[00:01:55] <kuudes> and past infection counts as 1 dose if it is recent enough, usually
[00:02:19] <kuudes> and if they have a vax mandate on entry, surely it is to prevent infections, not that you won't yourself fall ill
[00:02:36] <kuudes> so it makes sense to demand higher vaccination status from tourists than residents
[00:03:10] <ggreer> didn't we just argue and eventually agree that 2 shots of mrna is about as effective as prior infection?
[00:03:47] <kuudes> against infection it is worse, isn't it?
[00:04:00] <kuudes> mrna gives you 10%, infection gives you 0%
[00:04:47] <kuudes> and before omicron, 2 dose mrna was way better than past infection
[00:05:51] <kuudes> iirc in eu past infection is counted for 9 months
[00:06:24] <kuudes> and the data supported that it was reasonably effective, comparable to one dose, for 4-6 months
[00:06:45] <kuudes> maybe 8 if you stretched things

[00:07:08] <two2thehead> No reason why they *shouldn't* I just never realized it
[00:07:29] <kuudes> but indeed over here they still ban you getting a booster if you have got an infection in the past, because "you are now as protected as with booster, as you have 3 events" :-p
[00:07:32] <two2thehead> i'm sure a good enough solar panel can increase drone flight time exponentially
[00:09:31] <ggreer> two2thehead: hovering can it? a dji mavic 3 has a 40 minute hover time with a 77Wh battery, so that's 200 watts to hover
[00:10:01] <ggreer> that's a 900g drone
[00:10:32] <two2thehead> yeah, just hovering
[00:10:49] <two2thehead> note this was back in 2014 so I'm sure the tech has improved

[00:53:10] <Robomot> Highbrow, Lowbrows, Middlebrow, Now | AMERICAN HERITAGE (Our fascination with categorizing ourselves was fed in 1949 by a famous essay and chart that divided us by taste into different strata of culture. Now the man who invented these classifications brings us up to date.)
[00:53:35] <galambo> scroll down to 'Let‚Äôs talk about your 1949 chart and then have a try at bringing it up to date.'
[00:53:43] <galambo> and then go to the next pages
[00:53:56] <gwern> 'His point then was that people‚Äôs tastes could no longer be explained by their ‚Äúwealth or education, by breeding or background,‚Äù but that a new social stratification was growing, in which ‚Äúthe highbrows are the elite, the middlebrows are the bourgeoisie, and the lowbrows are hoi polloi.‚Äù' <-- note the subtle correct use of 'hoi polloi'
[00:54:30] <two2thehead> galambo, the high brow furniture looks terrible
[00:55:15] <galambo> two2thehead, in the article I linked to he says 'Referring to the old chart, I don‚Äôt think the Eames chair and Kurt Versen lamp are highbrow any more. That kind of thing is too common now. It has become middlebrow. I think highbrow furniture now is 1930s in nature‚Äîold Aalto chairs, or Danish. For upper middlebrow, let‚Äôs put Victorian‚Äîgood Victorian‚Äîand modern Chinese furniture, bright and cheap.'
[00:55:29] <two2thehead> hm
[00:56:52] <gwern> no, what happened is highbrowness is now about being ecumenical and showing you can find the best of the rest. any category works as long as you can spin a tale about how it's the very best and most obscure, and how together the menagerie works

[04:41:27] <two2thehead> I know you didn't say that. I'm just making fun of the analysts who think ICE car makers will eat tesla's lunch
[04:41:29] <ggreer> I mean they're definitely having some teething issues, but most of it is suffering from success
[04:46:44] <adiabatic> I'm still in the "wtf _can_ I eat" phase of this diet and Brad Marshall linked to https://www.theflavorbender.com/how-to-make-perfect-choux-pastry/ if you're too lazy to make croissants, as I am
[04:46:45] <Robomot> How to make Perfect Choux Pastry - The Flavor Bender (Learn how to make perfect Choux Pastry (Or Pate a Choux!) - The only recipe guide you will need to make profiteroles, eclairs, cream puffs and more.)
[04:47:02] <adiabatic> and this woman has a metric fuckton of text before the actual recipe
[04:47:12] <adiabatic> and it is *everything that can go wrong and how to fix it*
[04:47:29] <adiabatic> there's your good news of the day
[04:47:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: I've been making choux pastry (for cream puffs / profiteroles) for ~25 years, AMA
[04:48:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (They were the second dessert recipe I ever learned!)
[04:48:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The first was brownies)
[04:48:31] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: are there any butter-laden baking anythings that are easier to make than croissants or choux pastry?
[04:48:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have never made croissants so I can't speak about those specifically
[04:49:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "butter-laden" is an unusual category so I can't answer at once, gotta think about that one
[04:49:14] <adiabatic> like, don't the lazy kids dump yeast and flour and water in a bowl, let it proof overnight in the fridge or something, and then they have no-knead bread or something
[04:49:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean yes but that has no butter?
[04:49:38] <adiabatic> ideally, that level of laziness, but with butter
[04:50:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah uh that's a weird way to slice baked-things-space so I'll maybe consider your question
[04:50:07] <adiabatic> but I've done choux pastry before once for homemade churros
[04:50:37] <adiabatic> yeah, "slices the preexisting space weirdly" describes the croissant diet to a T.
[04:51:15] <adiabatic> (basically: minimize PUFAs, tolerate a teeny bit of MUFAs like omega-3 and omega-6, and go hog wild with the saturated fats)
[04:51:32] <adiabatic> also: pork and chicken fat have too-high **PUFAs**
[04:51:43] <adiabatic> unless you get artisanal chickens/pigs
[04:52:03] <ggreer> so tesla sold close to 1M vehicles this year. for comparison toyota sold around 10M vehicles worldwide this year
[04:52:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: ... maybe a no-knead brioche dough...?
[04:52:52] <two2thehead> ggreer, soon.tiff
[04:53:04] <two2thehead> I presume this year = 2021?
[04:53:07] <ggreer> yeah
[04:54:27] <adiabatic> hm, this King Arthur Flour recipe says to use a stand mixer‚Ä¶maybe 2022 is the year I get one
[04:54:31] <ggreer> if tesla continues to grow 50% year over year, they'll become the biggest car producer in the world in 6 years. there's no way they can keep up that sort of growth, but a decade from now they'll basically be toyota (and my model 3 will have ~150k miles on it, assuming I keep it that long)
[04:55:18] <adiabatic> I'm kind of looking forward to a decent boring reliable Honda, but I'm in no rush. My current car is gonna be fine for a while.

[05:03:54] <gwern> ggreer: it's like reading these *two* frontpage posts on HN about how deep learning doesn't work
[05:04:02] <gwern> how is it possible to be *so* obtuse and stubborn?
[05:04:20] <ggreer> I guess I should watch that documentary about the flat earthers to get an idea of that mindset
[05:04:33] <gwern> like, all of this was pretty obvious in 2015. how can you still be maintaining these positions in 2022 7 years later

[08:45:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Soak for the ladyfingers was a tricky concoction though. I made instant espresso, then I added cocoa powder (first making a paste from it, so it'd mix in properly), then added vodka and a couple oz bitters.

[11:28:34] <PapuaHardyNet> I was going to ask why CBT was not enthusiastically accepted by early LW comunity (2009-2013) as a minimum rationalist skill everybody should know
[11:29:22] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, CBT talks about cognitive distortions, and cognitive biases are an example of cognitive distortions (except rather less impactful than the more painful ones that people study CBT for)
[11:29:44] <PapuaHardyNet> so it seems sensible for me that CBT techniques should have been ubiquitous in the community members
[11:30:18] <PapuaHardyNet> hell, depression and akrasia should have been very rare in the lesswrong community, and if it was, that should have been the main focus of fixes
[11:32:59] <nshepperd2> i think there's a metallic law of some kind
[11:33:53] <nshepperd2> the one that says different psychotherapy methods don't actually make much difference, it's just a mysterious property of the individual therapist whether their patients get better
[11:34:26] <PapuaHardyNet> so it is simply the feeling of security and empathy that allows a patient to feel safe enough to change their beliefs
[11:34:31] <nshepperd2> so the answer might be for rats to go to therapy instead of learning CBT
[11:34:44] <nshepperd2> yeah maybe something like that
