[00:24:20] <yorick> [itchyjunk]: I think you need a bias
[00:24:47] <[itchyjunk]> so even with a correct ANN, it might not converge?
[00:25:01] <[itchyjunk]> Is tehre a way to tell if the ANN is correct but i need something else for it to converge?
[00:26:47] <yorick> [itchyjunk]: okay you don't need a bias

[00:27:21] <[itchyjunk]> Ah, that's what mine should look like. i started with random weights
[00:27:33] <yorick> [itchyjunk]: have you tried lower learning rate?
[00:27:49] <[itchyjunk]> I have not
[00:27:56] <yorick> 0.25 sounds quite high, try 0.0025
[00:28:04] <[itchyjunk]> I tried higher, thought it would converge faster lol
[00:28:17] <yorick> gradient descent requires it to not overshoot too much :D
[00:28:58] <[itchyjunk]> ah true

[00:31:37] <yorick> is it even going the right way?
[00:31:37] <gwern> I think you have a serious bug given that cycling and should simplify this even further. like I said, calculate known gradients. calculate special cases
[00:32:11] <yorick> gwern: well, it's either going to diverge like this or by going to infinity
[00:32:24] <yorick> but yeah, it does not seem to be performing gradient descent
[00:35:23] <yorick> [itchyjunk]: also, you're not training the 0 ^ 1 = 1 case
[00:36:52] <yorick> so your current function would probably converge on i1-i2
[00:38:45] <[itchyjunk]> should i train it on all 4? i was saving one for testing but i could pass it all 4
[00:39:01] <yorick> well, it's not xor if you don't include that case :D
[00:39:42] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[00:40:05] <yorick> this is something you'd do on real world data to avoid overfitting
[00:40:25] <yorick> but there isn't really any point since you want it to fit exactly

[02:29:40] <Betawolf> was it about the two being posted at the same time?
[02:30:01] <[itchyjunk]> So what would that suggest? Their vertibal column acts like a mini brain for them? I hear tails are rich in neurons, hmmm
[02:30:43] <[itchyjunk]> The idea of "multiple brains" like in octopus seems so strange and interesting
[02:30:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: No, Robomot just wasn't connected to here
[02:30:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who knows why
[02:31:13] <[itchyjunk]> I said humans have a second brain in their stomach and that annoyed a biologist a lot.
[02:31:31] <gwern> [itchyjunk]: well, my suggestion is that given examples like octopuses, alien hand syndrome, split-brain syndrome, self-tickling, heideggerian-inspired tooluse studies about body image etc, when the latency+bandwidth between two sets of neurons becomes large enough, control+predictability breaks down and they cease to have a unified self
[02:31:36] <[itchyjunk]> I didn't realize calling the dense neuron cluster in stomach a "second brain" annoyed some people that much
[02:32:12] <gwern> so given how fast tails move, and how they are maximally distant from the cat brain, and enriched for autonomous motor control & senses, tails may well 'feel' like a second brain
[02:32:13] <[itchyjunk]> ah, that would kinda make sense.
[02:32:25] <dTal> Pretty sure my stomach nerve cluster is my third brain, and my second brain is in my head. Won't say where the primary one is...
[02:32:29] <[itchyjunk]> I realize i've never thought of either latency or bandwidth of neurons..
[02:32:39] <gwern> remember, a tail is mostly there for balance. you can't roundtrip every last twitch of a tail in the middle of a pounce, it has to be highly autonomous
[02:32:44] <quanticle> [itchyjunk]: Well, it's more like... you can't just go around calling every dense cluster of neurons a "brain"
[02:32:47] <quanticle> Brains have structure!
[02:32:54] <dTal> neurons don't really have a bandwidth so much as a duty cycle
[02:33:09] <gwern> also keep in mind the studies of decerebrated cats - they can do things like walk over obstacles
[02:33:15] <[itchyjunk]> quanticle, i had read some random article where "it's like a brain" idea was thrown around so i went with it

[02:33:35] <dTal> I'm not sure I want to know what that is
[02:33:46] <gwern> the rest of the cat body can do a decent amount without the brain, so it's no surprise if the tail may be nontrivial

[02:34:12] <shawwwn>  I'm sure this makes sense, but it just sounds cute. groq describes chip data movement using `inward` or `outward`, OR `eastward` or `westward`. Apparently these are also context sensitive based on whether you're already in `west` or `east` hemisphere. So the end result is that you have 8 possibilities: 
[02:34:16] <shawwwn> `eastward` is `inward` in the `west`; `eastward` is `outward` in the `east`; `westward` is `outward` in the `west`; `westward` is `inward` in the `east`; `inward` is `eastward` in the `west`; `inward` is `westward` in the `east`; `outward` is `westward` in the `west`; and `outward` is `eastward` in the `east`.

[03:11:34] <quanticle> gwern: But how *does* handiness relate to philosophy of mind in terms of computational linkages?
[03:31:16] <gwern> you can interpret handiness in a useful non-continental way as what happens when a tool reaches a critical point of low latency control and precision such that it can be taken for granted & modeled as simply a part of you the way your fingers or eyes or hands no longer enter into consciousness, because there is no need for the lower-level parts of cognition to pass up any further information...
[03:31:22] <gwern> ...to the top-level parts which get bound into consciousness
[03:33:43] <quanticle> And then you can generalize that, I suppose into proficiency with all tools?
[03:37:22] <gwern> there's some fmri studies on how with increasing proficiency, activations transition from an external-object-like sort of way to a body-part, iirc
[03:38:12] <gwern> this also relates to the two-brain babies conjoined at the head - with so much rapid interconnectivity, they're like the opposite of splitbrains, and may have a quasi-overlapping identity

[04:03:14] <feepbot> was, that they decided their best recourse for staying healthy was to block off all the roads leading into town and to post armed guards to prevent anyone from coming in. That just blew me away—it was amazing to read that this had happened—and I thought it would be a very dramatic first scene....They were probably small towns that were already fairly isolated, and therefore
[04:03:14] <feepbot> might not have left such a good paper trail for historians to write about.

[09:44:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> "FWIW, my own experience is that people often miss fairly blatant psychotic episodes; so I’m not sure how Leverage-specific the explanation needs to be for this one. For example, once I came to believe that an acquaintance was having a psychotic episode and suggested he see a psychiatrist; the psychiatrist agreed. A friend who’d observed most of the same data I had asked me how I’d known. I said it was several things,
[09:44:53] <Obormot\Arcturus>  but that the bit where our acquaintance said God was talking to him through his cereal box was one of the tip-offs from my POV. My friend’s response was “oh, I thought that was a metaphor.”"

It was first described in 1992 by an American psychiatrist and scholar, Judith Herman in her book Trauma & Recovery
[09:46:50] <quanticle> and in an accompanying article. The disorder is included in the World Health Organization's (WHO) eleventh revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11).

[09:52:22] <shawwwn> I imagine I'll be able to walk up a steep hill at 46

[09:52:43] <shawwwn> they call it over the hill for a reason
[09:53:14] <shawwwn> it seems backwards though. "can no longer climb hills"

[09:54:14] <Robomot> Meet Vermont - Monastic Academy
[09:54:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sample excerpt from one of these people's bios:
[09:54:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "For the last six years, Khema’s family has been the tight-knit ecstatic dance and contact improv community in western MA. During that time, her life revolved around the study of touch, embodiment, movement, trauma healing, authentic communication, intimate relationship, and permaculture. She helped to start a Circling community there and later completed a Circling facilitator training. Over time, she grew a successful
[09:54:46] <Obormot\Arcturus>  private practice combining elements of professional cuddling, Thai massage, and Circling. Khema’s intention at MAPLE is to reconcile her Earth-based spirituality with Buddhist practice and to use that marriage to become a death doula for our dying civilization."
[09:55:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> (No, as far as I can tell, none of this is a parody and these people are completely serious.)
[09:56:09] <saturn3> professional cuddling??
[09:57:01] <quanticle> Yes, as opposed to the amateur cuddling you get in rationalist meetups
[09:57:02] <rmmh>  That grumpy dude muttering on the bus? Yup, he needs a cuddle. 
[09:57:16] <quanticle> I mean, there was that store in Portland that sold hugs

Can we regenerate soil and souls via the Dharma?"
[09:58:03] <saturn3> is it like professional wrestling?
[09:59:04] <shawwwn> amateur cuddling implies the existence of ranked competitive cuddling
[09:59:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Another one:
[09:59:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In the middle of her time at university, she took a year off to explore the questions of “Who am I?” and “What do I want to do with my life?,” which brought her to the Recurse Center in NYC and many dazed months in San Francisco. Upon returning to Princeton, she took up a minor in acting, and for her senior thesis, she created a solo show chronicling her experiences interviewing Asian Americans, entitled “The Girl

[10:13:37] <shawwwn> personally I thought it was a great idea, other than the sponsorship angle
[10:15:06] <quanticle> Don't cherry pits have an absolutely miniscule amount of cyanide?
[10:15:41] <rmmh> yes. it's also sealed inside. you'd need to grind them up to get exposure
[10:16:18] <quanticle> I was reading about plums and apricots, and while all of them have cyanide in their pits, you'd have to eat on the order of several dozen pounds before you got anywhere near a dose that would harm you
[10:18:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: Yes, but look what the link I posted has you do
[10:19:01] <shawwwn> not if you blend them
[10:19:21] <shawwwn> the trick is to gather a bag of appleseeds and throw it into a blender
[10:19:58] <shawwwn> I imagine it won't work, but it's also one of those ideas that seemed worth looking into
[10:20:18] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: oh. oh my.
[10:20:27] <quanticle> What is kirsch?
[10:20:53] <rmmh> kirsch is a clear, colorless brandy traditionally made from double distillation of morello cherries, a dark-colored cultivar of the sour cherry
[10:21:21] <shawwwn> it's also the sound anime characters make when they're unhappy
[10:21:24] <rmmh> Compared with brandy or whisky the characteristic features of kirsch are (a) that it contains relatively large quantities of higher alcohols and compound ethers, and (b) the presence in this spirit of small quantities of Hydrogen cyanide, partly as such and partly in combination as benzaldehyde-cyanhydrin, to which the distinctive flavour of kirsch is largely due
[10:21:29] <rmmh> It's A Feature (TM)
[10:21:31] <quanticle> >and also the taste of almonds coming from the cherry stones.
[10:21:39] <shawwwn> saturn3: saturn4 when
[10:21:44] <quanticle> Delicious cyanide
[10:22:23] <rmmh> well, the ethanol is going to cause more problems than the cyanide
[10:23:13] <rmmh> About 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of cherries go into the making of a 750 ml bottle of kirschwasser.

[10:27:49] <feep[work]> 08:14 < Obormot\Arcturus>  but that the bit where our acquaintance said God was talking to him through his cereal box was one of the tip-offs from my POV. My friend’s response was “oh, I thought that was a metaphor.”"
[10:28:05] <feep[work]> is this one of those things where some people just miss the basic human experience of God talking to them through a cereal box
[10:28:17] <feep[work]> and so they think that's metaphorical and everyone is in on it
[10:30:01] <feep[work]> quanticle: the brain absolutely has bugs lol, but you can't really debug it, you can just learn to manage them
[10:30:11] <nshepperd2> god is in all things, including cereal boxes
[10:30:21] <feep[work]> for instance, for me, I have always had intrusive and embarrassing thoughts, and it turns out there's an easy lifehack (that works for me) to get rid of them?
[10:30:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is the lifehack
[10:31:01] <feep[work]> I'm gonna have a lwcw five minute talk next year with just a title of "get rid of obsessive thoughts with this one easy trick"
[10:31:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> No tell us the trick now!
[10:31:14] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[10:31:21] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: okay, for me at least it was like ... taking the thought and deliberately acknowledging it as valuable and worthwhile
[10:31:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then?
[10:31:38] <feep[work]> it turns out the *cringe reaction itself* is what made it obsessive
[10:31:43] <feep[work]> and then it went away and never turned up again!
[10:31:44] <shawwwn> if you get a cereal box with god in it, do you have a higher chance of getting into heaven?
[10:31:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, well, duh
[10:31:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I was gonna say, why would thoughts ever be embarrassing
[10:32:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not like there's telepaths
[10:32:05] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: no this was like
[10:32:11] <feep[work]> "hey remember that time you were an asshole to someone"
[10:32:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> ok
[10:32:26] <feep[work]> "you do? really? better bring it up at 1am while you're in bed to make super sure"
[10:32:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> But how does this solve *intrusive* thoughts that aren't "cringeworthy" or w/e
[10:32:42] <feep[work]> and I'm like "go away thought, you are pointless" and it was like "okay, but I'LL BE BACK"
[10:32:56] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: the lesson is "go away thought, you are pointless" not just doesn't work but is counterproductive
[10:32:59] <feep[work]> I did not know this :p
[10:33:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> ok
[10:33:10] <feep[work]> to the brain it's like hitting snooze
[10:33:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> The correct reaction of course is to unplug it
[10:33:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wait, no
[10:33:37] <feep[work]> it just delays it
[10:33:46] <feep[work]> well, the correct reaction is to get up
[10:33:56] <shawwwn> "our god is an awesome chef 🎶  he cooks from heaven above 🎶 with wisdom, flour and love our god is an awesome chef"
[10:33:56] <feep[work]> which in this metaphor involves *re-estimating the thought as desired*.
[10:34:07] <shawwwn> everybody now
[10:34:10] <feep[work]> like, find a reason why this is a good thought to have.
[10:34:22] <feep[work]> and this makes it go away! because brains are nonsense
[10:34:45] <nshepperd2> #get out of the car
[10:34:53] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: no you can do it like with mantras
[10:35:02] <feep[work]> you literally just have to convince yourself that the thought is valuable and good.
[10:35:13] <feep[work]> you don't even have to really believe it
[10:35:24] <rmmh> feep[work] aborting batch processing jobs in the brain and wondering why they keep getting rescheduled 
[10:35:34] <feep[work]> rmmh: yep exactly, I think that's what is happening
[10:35:55] <feep[work]> the brain can't mark it as "resolved" until it is no longer "the sort of thought that makes you flinch away"
[10:35:55] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[10:36:23] <feep[work]> in my case the thought was "that time I was a total asshole to someone at lwcw"
[10:36:41] <feep[work]> and the reaction that *didn't* work was "I already apologized, this is stupid"
[10:36:50] <feep[work]> that was the snooze equivalent
[10:37:04] <feep[work]> what *did* work was "thank you, remembering you will help me be less of a dick in the future"
[10:37:16] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus, rmmh: https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cherry-pits#cyanide-levels I attempted to look up how many cherry pits you could safely consume, but these numbers seem pretty low

[10:37:24] <feep[work]> you just have to recontextualize it as something useful.
[10:37:45] <quanticle> And I don't know whether to believe them
[10:37:58] <quanticle> Regardless, I do not plan on eating cherry pits in the near future
[10:38:02] <feep[work]> cyanide or happiness
[10:38:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: For me the response that works is more like: "Hey rememeber the time you were a dick to someone?" "lol yeah" "..." "..." "ok then :(" *thought gives up and goes away*
[10:38:28] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: that would also work
[10:38:35] <feep[work]> the problem is that the cringe reaction causes reocurrence.

[10:39:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: But will you drink kirsch
[10:39:01] <feep[work]> and you can't suppress that by cringing even harder, or by getting angry at yourself, which tends to be the default for me
[10:39:02] <nshepperd2> by 'may lead to cyanide toxicity' i assume they mean like the minimum noticeable level of sickness? and not like, death

[10:44:12] <feep[work]> now I understand how oldtimers feel
[10:44:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's a reason the virgin vs. chad meme is like "chad: never considers other people's feelings at all" or w/e
[10:44:33] <feep[work]> well I mean, that is one path to based

In these cases we recognize that we’re asking too much of our children at their current stage of development. It turns out that Little Charlie is just not ready for amusement park excursions yet. So we switch from trying to modify the behavior to trying to modify the environment. In the above
[10:45:14] <quanticle> example, it’s very simple! We just don’t go to the amusement park for a while, until we feel like Charlie might have grown in such a way that we can try again."

[10:45:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, today I made pancakes in my cast iron pan... they came out slightly scorched because I was adjusting stuff, but nevertheless *absolutely refused* to stick to the pan even a tiny bit

[12:39:59] <feep[work]> language is fun

[12:40:47] <saturn3> having to go outside for a bit is not a nervous breakdown

[12:48:54] <feep[work]> I just realized why we have a sense of self that can be disabled viz cotard delusion
[12:49:05] <feep[work]> because we have to be able to *imagine futures in which we do not exist*.
[12:49:32] <ivan> we have a sense of self because evolution hacked you to do its bidding
[12:49:33] <feep[work]> or generally, not even futures, just spaces where we don't exist
[12:49:44] <feep[work]> ivan: no that's a non-answer, it still has to *operationally do something*
[12:49:53] <feep[work]> the point is usually we exist in the center of our visual perception
[12:50:05] <feep[work]> but if we imagine another place, that has to be "a place where we are not"
[12:50:17] <feep[work]> ie. our imagination is centered on "a place where we are not"
[12:50:50] <feep[work]> that's why "we exist" has to be an active qualia, to indicate the state of "the perception is rooted to the perceptual origin"
[12:51:01] <feep[work]> immediate perceptual origin*

[13:48:56] <feep[work]> I have empathy for these people's experiences, but uh I also have empathy for the people they have to work with
[13:50:02] <rsaarelm> Heh.
[13:50:03] <feep[work]> I think it's that they view trying to make things make sense as normal, and people "thinking things are magic" as the abberation
[13:50:15] <feep[work]> where nowadays I see trying to fit everything into the same map as a kind of compulsion
[13:50:31] <feep[work]> that is usually maladaptive but sometimes beneficial
[13:50:33] <rsaarelm> That sorta sounds like the Kegan stages stuff.
[13:50:41] <saturn3> there were posts about that too
[13:50:50] <feep[work]> right, but this post predates those I think
[13:50:59] <feep[work]> at least from what I can tell, the community as a whole has evolved
[13:51:08] <Gurkenglas> what is bad about having to work with people that try to fit everything into one map?
[13:51:13] <rsaarelm> Like, you have one Kegan stage 4 framework and you try to fit everything to it but it's round peg square hole with a lot of stuff.
[13:51:23] <feep[work]> yes.
[13:51:33] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: well, it's a question of cost/benefit, right?
[13:51:48] <rsaarelm> Because if you had an explicit framework that you actually could productively fit everything in, you'd have an AGI.
[13:51:54] <feep[work]> most people adopt "magical" (I prefer "instrumentalizing") thinking because it gets them where they want to go with minimal effort.
[13:51:57] <saturn3> https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/aHaqgTNnFzD7NGLMx/reason-as-memetic-immune-disorder this one was earlier

He quickly found that You may have noticed that people who convert to religion after the age of 20 or so are generally more zealous than people who grew up with the same religion. …)
[13:52:13] <feep[work]> saturn3: right, but that still has the "religion" framing
[13:52:19] <feep[work]> that views not generalizing as almost broken.
[13:52:29] <rsaarelm> But I guess people don't pick up this lesson and just go do the age-old thing of holding on to their favorite framework and trying to go on ignoring the stuff that shows up and doens't fit.
[13:52:32] <feep[work]> or like, "maybe it's good for social things, but it's definitely bad for understanding the world!"!
[13:53:27] <feep[work]> where nowadays I'm pretty sure that not generalizing is almost universally adaptive, and our problem is that we can't ever "let it rest" and that keeps us from instrumentalizing complex systems
[13:53:33] <saturn3> i have to side with the autists on this one (even though doctors have told me i'm not autistic)
[13:53:59] <feep[work]> well, but also I mean, like
[13:54:10] <feep[work]> one of the things where not generalizing is really really maladaptive is programming, right?
[13:54:16] <rsaarelm> One problem with social stuff is that it stops scaling pretty fast.
[13:54:22] <rsaarelm> If you want to run a big society, you gotta autist.
[13:54:27] <feep[work]> no my point is, it's *not* just for scaling stuff.
[13:54:29] <feep[work]> er, for social*
[13:54:46] <feep[work]> if you want to run a big society, you have to trust and use systems that make no sense
[13:55:01] <rsaarelm> Hm.
[13:55:11] <rsaarelm> "Make no sense" sounds like a pretty strong wording.
[13:55:19] <feep[work]> that ... okay, yeah
[13:55:24] <feep[work]> that make sense only given exorbitant effort.
[13:55:33] <rsaarelm> Like, "systems where you don't know the details" vs "systems where you have no idea what they are or why they're there".
[13:55:49] <feep[work]> like, a two-peaks model, "utility given adequate understanding" vs "utility given complete understanding"
[13:56:03] <saturn3> fitting everything onto one map is always a worthy goal. maybe you're trying to say it's not the only worthy goal, which i agree with
[13:56:13] <Gurkenglas> everyone has multiple maps and interfaces between them; you're saying they're trying to find as many connections as possible, right?
[13:56:17] <feep[work]> it's always a valid goal, because all goals are valid
[13:56:24] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao
[13:56:26] <feep[work]> it's not always a *worthwhile* goal, instrumentally.
[13:56:46] <feep[work]> it's unusually worthwhile in programming, ime.
[13:56:52] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: yes
[13:56:54] <PapuaHardyNet> so as the training goes on, the time taken for inference increased logarithmically

[13:57:53] <saturn3> if you don't want to fit everything onto one map at least a little bit, i don't like you
[13:58:08] <feep[work]> saturn3: that's fair and reasonable, and I do share that desire for conceptual unification
[13:58:14] <Gurkenglas> two-peaks? in the utility gain per effort invested, i suppose you mean.
[13:58:20] <feep[work]> saturn3: I'm just saying I no longer think it's *obviously beneficial* too.
[13:58:25] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: yes
[13:58:37] <saturn3> ok
[14:00:02] <Gurkenglas> saturn3, what if someone has a positive or negative opinion on it only because of their experience with how useful it is instrumentally?
[14:01:59] <saturn3> Gurkenglas: i guess that doesn't matter
[14:03:17] <Gurkenglas> saturn3, I posit significant probability that every single human acquires their opinion on the matter that way as a matter of how brains grow.
[14:04:23] <saturn3> what do you mean by "how brains grow"?
[14:05:32] <feep[work]> unrelated sidenote: the thing about defocusing attention is, I can actually demonstrate clear benefits in my everyday life to it as a technique, like, there's skills I have where I can, by comparison say, "I can do this because I have some amount of conscious control over my attention"
[14:05:39] <Gurkenglas> saturn3, that a fetus starts out without an instinctive, (genetic?) opinion on the value of interfacing maps tightly, and then that opinion is trained to work well with the current instantiation of hyperparameters
[14:05:50] <feep[work]> that's always been a weakpoint to "lesswrong meditation" posts imo
[14:06:16] <saturn3> feep[work]: great, you have passed obormot's cake test
[14:06:31] <feep[work]> like, for instance, if someone just does that defocusing exercise, I expect them to be on average significantly faster at finding a specific item in a sorted list
[14:07:09] <feep[work]> or following a path through an expanded directory tree.
[14:07:27] <Gurkenglas> saturn3, of course you needn't stop caring about things once you learn what they are made of; what you do in an ontological crisis is you rescue the utility function.
[14:07:32] <saturn3> Gurkenglas: the high correlation with autism seems like evidence against that
[14:07:33] <feep[work]> or finding the logout button on a website :)
[14:07:38] <pompolic> i experimented with something like defocusing to play RTSes
[14:07:46] <pompolic> i don't remember what came of it
[14:07:46] <feep[work]> that also makes sense, yeah.
[14:08:06] <pompolic> i know Dawn of War gave me a headache last i played it
[14:08:14] <feep[work]> pompolic: I haven't played rtses in ages, but what I wanted to try but never got around to, is having a ten second click track
[14:08:26] <pompolic> what's a click track?
[14:08:29] <feep[work]> hm, may be too long, five seconds?
[14:08:36] <feep[work]> it's ... a track that goes click, lol
[14:08:56] <feep[work]> um, it's a thing you do in music where you have a dedicated channel with just metronome clicks on the beat
[14:09:05] <feep[work]> to time all the performers together
[14:09:32] <feep[work]> the idea here would be that every time I hear a click, I have to switch task in the rts
[14:09:43] <Gurkenglas> saturn3, the *correlation* with autism allows that the opinion on tightly integrating maps and the hyperparameters in the genes are moderately causally distant!
[14:09:44] <feep[work]> ie. produce more things at my base, send out a scout, queue a worker, etc etc
[14:10:10] <feep[work]> I wanted to try this because *switching active tasks* was something I was really bad at in rtses.

[14:13:41] <feep[work]> though I might be wrong ofc, and it's at least plausible to me that the "programmer flow state" is an accident caused by a lack of internal interrupts
[14:13:56] <pompolic> trying to switch tasks is what I think gave me a headache
[14:14:02] *** Mateon2 is now known as Mateon1
[14:14:04] <pompolic> +1 on lack of internal interrupts, I think
[14:14:29] <pompolic> the idea was, trying to see if I can diffuse my attention over my entire base, and leverage flow state
[14:14:39] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], ...okay it's plausible that deliberate task switching would rather train deliberate focus than task switching
[14:14:59] <feep[work]> pompolic: oh, I think games like starcraft 2 are actively antithetical to that
[14:15:04] <feep[work]> PA maybe.
[14:15:09] <pompolic> that's because starcraft 2 is bad
[14:15:12] <feep[work]> :p
[14:15:21] <pompolic> SupCom might be amenable to it
[14:15:34] <pompolic> with SupCom i get bogged down by trying to make a pretty base
[14:15:37] <feep[work]> pompolic: I think in RTSes, it's more important to "remember to start new tasks" than maintain concentration on existing tasks
[14:15:43] <Gurkenglas> uh, as in "trains(deliberate task switching, deliberate focus) > trains(deliberate task switching, task switching)"
[14:15:54] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: mm
[14:16:10] <pompolic> task initiation is the part of executive function I'm the worst at :D
[14:16:14] <feep[work]> same
[14:16:44] <pompolic> i speculate it's actually a side effect from school
[14:17:00] <pompolic> punishment for "not paying attention", etc
[14:17:11] <feep[work]> bleh
[14:17:25] <feep[work]> at this rate if I ever put together a programmer bootcamp, half of it will be "undoing bad school habits"
[14:17:38] <pompolic> funny how that works
[14:17:49] <pompolic> i analogize it to forkbombing myself
[14:18:13] <pompolic> i said i'm bad at task initiation but that's not exactly true -- i can do it, but it's like old tasks don't get cleaned up properly
[14:18:18] <pompolic> gotta download more RAM
[14:18:37] <Gurkenglas> amphetamines immediately helped me do math all day instead of gaming all day; now, half a year later, a lot of the benefit is gone. i do a thing i should be doing and then i succumb to a mounting preference to not, within minutes
[14:18:54] * feep[work] hugs Gurkenglas 
[14:18:57] <pompolic> interesting
[14:19:17] <pompolic> i have days pretty often when, no matter what I do, I want to do something else
[14:20:16] <pompolic> but I dealt with it long enough that I have "mental motions" for handling it. would be nice if I could translate it to shareable form
[14:20:40] <pompolic> instead of "lol don't look at thing look at other thing"
[14:21:21] <pompolic> oh yeah, nicotine helped with staying on task, a bit too much in fact
[14:21:47] <saturn3> try amphetamine for half a year, then nicotine for half a year
[14:21:53] <pompolic> big brain
[14:23:03] <pompolic> the felt sense of wanting to do something else is a bit like something tugging at my attention to look somewhere else. nicotine presses the mute button on it. never did amphetamines but caffeine also has a form of that, for a while
[14:23:18] <pompolic> then it's instead constantly spawning new tasks and browser tabs
[14:23:54] <pompolic> I think gains could be made by not automatically responding to said pull on one's attention
[14:24:15] <pompolic> dunno how others experience it, though
[14:24:28] <pompolic> n=1 study yaaaaay
[14:26:13] <feep[work]> I have the same problem, but I think fast electric music helps
[14:26:23] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: switch to alternating modafinil and amphetamines and nicotine
[14:26:29] <feep[work]> not sure if that overlaps with amphetamines in effect
[14:26:42] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm surprised you blazed through amphetamines especially when you know that tolerance will be created
[14:28:28] <Gurkenglas> the doctor said sometimes it stops working after months and was in favor of taking some days of break every month or so iirc, which i did; is that the wrong strategy?
[14:29:26] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: nah, just a gwern suggestion https://www.gwern.net/Nicotine#health-issues
[14:29:27] <Robomot> Nicotine · Gwern.net [] (On the benefits and lack of demerits of nicotine (research up to 2015))
[14:29:33] <PapuaHardyNet> "On the other hand, even if one does develop tolerance to nicotine, that simply suggests spacing it out or rotating with other stimulants. One could imagine a 3-day cycle: nicotine, caffeine, and modafinil."
[14:29:50] <feep[work]> nicotine, caffeine, modafinil, GABBERDISCO
[14:29:57] <pompolic> funfact, i looked at that page to decide whether to start using nicotine or not :D
[14:30:01] <Gurkenglas> if a 3-day cycle was the One Simple Trick i woulda expected know your amphetamines to mention it
[14:30:42] <PapuaHardyNet> that's the only place I've encountered this suggestion
[14:30:55] <PapuaHardyNet> I highly doubt an X-day cycling of stimulants is popular
[14:31:16] <Gurkenglas> the argument for benefit is general enough that you could liken it to crop rotation :P
[14:31:41] <saturn3> 3 days is probably too short
[14:32:29] <Gurkenglas> so what you're saying is do *all* the drugs

[15:00:40] <pompolic> mst: yes, the last time i happened i alt-tabbed out of the game i was playing and worked for a few hours straight. then said alt-tabbing triggered a rare and mysterious bug in said game (that has been known) and i started researching that :D
[15:02:03] <pompolic> i'm reading the simulation hypothesis guy on DSL and I have a few observations: I had also been prone to irrational fears as a kid, and I think I can see how it relates to current anxiety issues
[15:02:11] <pompolic> the number pattern thing specifically, however
[15:02:41] <pompolic> one time in math camp we somehow ended up playing a game with a friend, without agreeing on the rules beforehand
[15:03:29] <pompolic> the goal was to find the number "53" by performing operations on numbers we see (i think after seeing a string of 53s)
[15:03:50] <pompolic> and it went something like, one person suggested a sighting, the other person decided if it was trying too hard or not

[20:57:52] <catern> i have a good new idea on how to do interviews
[20:58:01] <catern> I'll simply present them with some information and ask them to make puns
[20:58:14] <catern> you see, scott alexander is good at puns, and gwern is good at puns, and I'm ok at puns
[20:58:24] <catern> so clearly, smart good people are good at puns
[20:58:34] <shawwwn> that's as good as any other tactic
[20:58:36] <PapuaHardyNet> qed
[20:59:33] <shawwwn> my current job's interview process was "your goal is to make security arrangements for a reclusive billionaire. What would you do?" and "Think of as many creative uses of a soda can as possible. You have 3 minutes *starts timer*"
[20:59:43] <catern> shawwwn: are you serious?

[21:00:37] <shawwwn> I got to 45 seconds remaining on the timer and surrendered the rest of my time, saying that I was happy with my answers and that I couldn't think of any other creative uses for a can
[21:00:59] <PapuaHardyNet> the onjy things that come to my mind are nsfw
[21:00:59] <catern> did you say "stick it up your butt"?
[21:01:03] <shawwwn> they were like "are you sure? knowing that you'll be graded on quantity?" (i.e. it's always foolish to surrender time if you can think of more answers)
[21:01:05] <catern> that seems like something you would say
[21:01:08] <saturn3> how many uses did you think of?
[21:01:18] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: yep, that's all that came to mind
[21:01:24] <feep> I thought "well I have three minutes to convince them this is a trash question"
[21:01:29] <shawwwn> oh, about a dozen. I liked "make a home for a mouse"
[21:01:30] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: yeah and it's a very shawwwn answer
[21:01:38] <feep> because you just need to realize "a can is a container" and then you can just list off container things
[21:01:38] <shawwwn> and "use the metal to help build circuits"
[21:02:09] <feep> my favorite creative use of a can is lockpicking
[21:02:17] <shawwwn> well, the question is designed to penalize container things. The goal is creative answers
[21:02:25] <shawwwn> so e.g. "holds liquid" gives zero points
[21:02:32] <saturn3> throw it at someone who asks for creative uses of a soda can
[21:02:35] <shawwwn> since that's the point of a can
[21:02:36] <catern> shawwwn: so did you say "up the butt" or not?

[21:03:01] <feep> very big salt shaker
[21:03:04] <feep> peppermill
[21:03:29] <shawwwn> almost :) they asked "why do you think we ask this question?" which gave an opportunity for an "up the butt" answer
[21:03:35] <saturn3> ok feep this isn't an actual job interview
[21:03:43] <feep> then you realize you can take off the top and the bottom and now you can do anything that involves a flat sheet, ie. aforementioned lockpicking
[21:03:43] <catern> feep, you're hired
[21:03:54] <feep> yeah but it's still a shit question tho
[21:03:59] <shawwwn> but I said that I think they ask it because they feel it's effective, even though I don't see how thinking of creative uses of a can could be correlated with whether someone is good at ML engineering
[21:04:16] <catern> shawwwn: that's cheating
[21:04:29] <feep> shawwwn: yeah if they explicitly asked me that I'd be very tempted to say "you're looking for candidates who can tell you that your process is very stupid"
[21:04:31] <shawwwn> cheating is often the most effective way to pass a test
[21:04:50] <catern> that's like saying "I think you ask this question because your life experiences have caused you to have beliefs that make you ask this question"
[21:05:16] <shawwwn> sounds like a correct answer :)
[21:05:18] <catern> or better yet "I think you ask this question because the divine watchmaker set up initial conditions just so"
[21:06:05] <shawwwn> when you care about changing someone's mind, it's a very bad idea to simply state your reasons. it's a better idea to state their point of view first, and ideally to ask them questions
[21:06:24] <shawwwn> when you can't ask them questions, and you have to say something, you have to subtly plant the idea in their minds that their current approach isn't effective
[21:06:46] <shawwwn> if you really *really* care, then yes, sometimes you have to fight political battles. but an interview isn't the right setting for that.
[21:06:52] <catern> yeah that sucks
[21:06:54] <shawwwn> so of course a non answer is optimal
[21:07:03] <saturn3> "i think you ask this question because it has a lot of synergy and paradigm shifts"
[21:07:14] <catern> i'm glad here in #lesswrong we're rational and so it's optimal to simply state the reasons why someone is wrong
[21:07:31] <shawwwn> eh, I find it fascinating. They have 201 people in slack, so supposedly they're paying at least $150k * 201 per year
[21:07:52] <PapuaHardyNet> that's a lot of money
[21:07:52] <shawwwn> the idea that the whole company was built from that style of interview makes me giddy
[21:08:35] <shawwwn> yes. So I'll happily puzzle away on their TSP and figure out clever ways to move data around
[21:08:56] <shawwwn> in the meantime, presumably they're still asking candidates for creative uses of staplers 
[21:09:20] <shawwwn> (it was "any household item" and he went *looks around room* "Ok, a soda can")
[21:09:39] <catern> stapler is harder than soda can
[21:09:44] <catern> not well calibrated interview
[21:10:06] <gwern> just goes to show why structured interviews work better
[21:12:22] <catern> exactly, so that's why my pun-based interview idea will work much better
[21:13:20] <catern> i'm doing a bunch of interviews right now, my last one was basically "hey tell me about obscure C++ tricks and minutiae", which is basically the same thing as a pun-based interview

[21:33:49] <kuudes> per age specific mortality of covid and current covid vaccination level in finland, I estimate we will get about 2000 covid deaths minimum when covid walks over the population here. (14000 with plain data, but if one squeezes one's eyes and fudges the data, one could perhaps get to 2000). (Population of Finland is 5500k persons)
[21:33:58] <kuudes> 2000 deaths may not be that much for many, but it seems that there are about 1/5 deaths/icu cases. This implies there would therefore be 10000 icu cases, and as iirc covid icu term is about 2 weeks, that would mean a strain of about 20000 icu-weeks.
[21:33:58] <kuudes> in Finland the maximum icu bed occupancy for covid patients before having to cease other hospital activity is estimated to be 50. therefore if we run those icu beds at maximum pace, 20000 icuweeks / 50 icubeds = 400 weeks, about 8 years
[21:34:04] <kuudes> So the crux of the problem is that either the situation will remain like this "forever" or also other people who will not get to icu will die to not-covid.
[21:34:52] <kuudes> a doctor has proposed founding of special covid-hospitals, which could maybe have for instance 200 special covid-icu-beds
[21:35:11] <kuudes> that seems humane, but is actually a way to propose to direct the death to the unvaccinated
[21:35:36] <shawwwn> catern: it's interesting that you feel that #lesswrong is more likely to change your mind with logical arguments. For example, I don't think anyone could persuade you that asking about C++ minutiae is anticorrelated with job performance
[21:36:21] <shawwwn> persuading someone isn't merely a logic problem.
[21:36:33] <kuudes> if the disease goes over the population in mentioned 100 days, that is 13 weeks, those 200 beds would take care of 13*200 = 2600 icuweeks out of that 20000 icuweeks, and 17400 icuweeks or 8700 persons would get killed by triage when the beds were full
[21:36:55] <kuudes> if triage would take in consideration the vaccination status, I suppose they could try to direct the deaths to unvaccinated people
[21:37:25] <kuudes> it still seems to me that if this is the other option, just forced vaccinating everyone who does not get a medical opt-out certificate is more humane
[21:37:49] <shawwwn> kuudes, my friend
[21:37:50] <kuudes> we already have a forced vaccination as an option in the law, from times before this pandemic
[21:38:03] <kuudes> so it would not require any new laws, just a government decision
[21:38:18] <shawwwn> I love you to death. but I have to ask -- why is it that you spend so much time thinking about disease?
[21:38:18] <kuudes> hi my friend shawwwn!
[21:38:58] <PapuaHardyNet> shawwwn: you'll understand after you shoot yourself with three doses of covid vaccine
[21:38:59] <kuudes> because I fear it will kill me or a person dear to me
[21:39:03] <shawwwn> there's nothing wrong with being obsessed about something. I'm obsessed about many things. But I wonder why you're so obsessed with clinical matters
[21:39:17] <PapuaHardyNet> also kuudes has children
[21:39:22] <kuudes> I am currently in another flu. I have these days about 20 flus per year, it seems
[21:39:31] <shawwwn> ah :(
[21:39:39] <shawwwn> sorry that you have to go through that.
[21:40:00] <kuudes> this is still much improvement to pre-immune medication times. I have much less pains etc
[21:40:09] <gwern> kuudes: how do you get so many flus, between gained immunity and flu shots?
[21:40:21] <kuudes> not influenzas, common colds
[21:40:46] <kuudes> on average year there are 10 common cold spikes in finland. most people don't get them all
[21:40:56] <shawwwn> may I suggest a bubble
[21:41:07] <PapuaHardyNet> a bubble?
[21:41:09] <kuudes> I currently meet rather few persons :-p
[21:41:27] <shawwwn> kuudes rn https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/02/15/bubble-boy-0.jpg?width=990&auto=webp&quality=75
[21:41:27] <PapuaHardyNet> oh a bubble as in a group of people you interact with
[21:41:34] <kuudes> shawwwn, I wonder if tomorrow I will get a covid test. I have so far 23 of them :-p
[21:41:34] <shawwwn> no a literal bubble
[21:42:20] <kuudes> plus I am in weird borderline on if I affect or don't affect the local legal environment, it is weird
[21:42:30] <kuudes> per priors, one person talking on internet does not affect policies
[21:42:40] <gwern> how about zenzei suits with builtin p100 filters
[21:42:46] <PapuaHardyNet> that is correct
[21:42:51] <shawwwn> indeed it doesn't. which makes me worry why you spend so much time talking about it
[21:42:55] <kuudes> still, it seems I do sufficiently weird things that at times things change for general population after I do my weird things
[21:42:58] <shawwwn> you could do so much more
[21:43:14] <kuudes> like, third doses started here after I called my health center and demanded I be given one
[21:43:15] <shawwwn> the conversation isn't unwelcome, as long as you're happy
[21:43:43] <PapuaHardyNet> wow, that's impressive
[21:43:43] <catern> shawwwn: that's where you wrong bucko
[21:43:52] <catern> shawwwn: I already think C++ minutiae is useless
[21:44:14] <kuudes> it seems there are exactly 3 positive errors in health databases of first doses here. on the exact days I have got "first dose" to my dear people
[21:44:26] <kuudes> which is a weird coincidence.
[21:44:33] <shawwwn> catern: accept the inevitable logical outcome that all interviews are useless, and that the real interview begins after someone is hired
[21:45:14] <kuudes> also there are small random cases where I have discussed a thing in another irc channel where some activists and I think some journalists hang out, and the media has made scoops out of the matter the next day
[21:45:34] <kuudes> this is weird. I am unsure if it is pareidolia (likely) or not (possible)
[21:45:36] <shawwwn> "the 4chan theory of influence"
[21:45:38] <kuudes> yes
[21:45:54] <shawwwn> my friend was pretty convinced of similar things, that hanging out on /pol/ all day was influential
[21:45:56] <kuudes> I have in the past been to politics, and done actual things
[21:46:12] <kuudes> like postponed a national copyright law change by a parliament term
[21:46:21] <kuudes> or gotten a CIX to my city
[21:46:29] <shawwwn> but why do you care so much about humans and your city?
[21:46:37] <kuudes> that is a good question
[21:46:41] <kuudes> I presume it could be genetics
[21:46:51] <shawwwn> heh. that's a remarkably good answer
[21:47:13] <kuudes> my grandfather apparently burned himself out being a small town mayor for a while, before moving to city and starting to work in steelcasting
[21:48:00] <catern> shawwwn: that's why work-sample tests are the gold standard
[21:48:02] <shawwwn> yeah, my father was similarly small town politick-y
[21:48:15] <shawwwn> it didn't seem to affect much of anything, but it certainly occupied his time...
[21:48:52] <gwern> that was something that struck me watching _it's a wonderful life_: as a little kid, you don't really appreciate the extent to which it's a no-holds-barred depiction of a small-town parasitizing and destroying its most gifted and promising youth
[21:48:57] <shawwwn> catern: then why are you asking about C++ minutiae? you see, it's not as simple as that
[21:49:38] <gwern> (george bailey never becoming a great architecture/engineer/CEO and instead settling for a little credit union to help the poor people of his town build little houses is probably great for his small town, and bad for humanity)
[21:49:45] <kuudes> so currently I have settled for being a remote software developer who gets a monthly salary and has a family and gets to hang with you guys here etc...
[21:51:12] <shawwwn> That’s a fine life
[21:51:13] <kuudes> gwern, I am unsure if more ambition is worth it. Musk-level yes, but, say, Alvar Aalto?
[21:51:20] <shawwwn> I was only curious
[21:51:23] <kuudes> :)
[21:51:23] <gwern> shawwwn: but is it a wonderful one?
[21:51:25] <kuudes> thanks

He never regarded himself as an artist, seeing painting and sculpture as "branches of the tree whose trunk is architecture."[ …)
[21:52:17] <gwern> unfamiliar with him, but if you don't aim to be a Musk, how will you fail even as well as an Aalto?

[22:00:01] <shawwwn> There was an amazing meme last night about Elon which sadly I can’t find
[22:01:10] <shawwwn> The comic went: Elon at 29: his parents: “sure is nice to be an African diamond whatever” (I forget the wording). Elon: “yes”. Elon at 48: “I am a gigagenius who got here by my own wit alone”
[22:01:48] <shawwwn> So yes, good luck aiming to be an Elon
[22:02:17] <rmmh> not just hereditary though
[22:02:19] <shawwwn> Perhaps you can do an aggressive takeover of a company like Tesla and then call yourself a founder when you’re not
[22:02:20] <gwern> it was an emerald mine, which the father didn't own, and ran out, and didn't share with his separated wife and kids, and elon was dirt-poor and cadging free pizza when he came to NA, long before 29
[22:02:28] <adiabatic> gigagenius and a giant wad of money beats gigagenius alone, news at 11
[22:02:34] <shawwwn> Lmao at dirt poor
[22:02:57] <gwern> and said money had nothing to do with his paypal work etc
[22:03:00] <rmmh> musk appears to have made his money largely on the .com boom
[22:03:12] <rmmh> (and then spacex and tesla, obv)
[22:03:13] <gwern> so, that comic is fractally wrong in a typically smarmy socialist way
[22:03:34] <rmmh> musk isn't like trump where his fortune is 1) hereditary and 2) diminished by his bumbling
[22:03:36] <shawwwn> Yeah, and how was he even able to get into a position to make that money in the first place? Ah yes, it was all his intellect and hard work
[22:03:44] <shawwwn> Nothing whatsoever to do with background or connections
[22:03:47] <gwern> yeah, pretty much. he was a programmer
[22:04:02] <gwern> what 'connections'?
[22:04:08] <rmmh> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#Education
[22:04:10] <Robomot> Elon Musk - Wikipedia [Education] (Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is the richest person in the world as of September 2021.[2] …)
[22:04:21] <shawwwn> Oh gee I dunno maybe having a literal emerald mine in the family rofl
[22:04:46] <feep> musk is an emerald mage
[22:04:51] <feep> he draws intellect from emeralds
[22:05:01] <feep> the connections are esoteric
[22:05:01] <rmmh> none of his story in the 90s sounds any different from other startup founders making fat stacks using angel investors and having their companies bought
[22:05:08] <shawwwn> Or being admitted to Stanford
[22:05:30] <gwern> ah yes, stanford. as is well known, they don't admit based on intellect or hard work at all, it's all about how many emeralds you pass the bursar
[22:05:33] <feep> yeah all the connections he made in the uh
[22:05:37] <feep> two days he was at stanford
[22:05:45] <shawwwn> Eye roll
[22:05:53] <feep> you know, even under your theory, musk must be fucking amazing at making connections
[22:06:05] <gwern> stanford, that bastion of inherited privilege! only those of the bluest blood are admitted
[22:06:06] <rmmh> yes
[22:06:08] <shawwwn> Oh, don’t get me wrong. He’s amazing
[22:06:13] <gwern> you thought it was a diamond mine. why do you believe anything else you believed about it?
[22:06:21] <rmmh> musk is far more of a self-made businessman than gates
[22:06:23] <shawwwn> I just think it’s absolutely absurd to say that people should try to be like him
[22:06:48] <feep> I mean, I think "I can't be like musk" is mostly an excuse to not have to put in effort. 
[22:06:50] <adiabatic> shawwwn: the trick is knowing what any given person can copy, and what that person can't
[22:06:56] <shawwwn> You’re either born with that sort of starting hand (in the poker sense) or you’re not
[22:07:09] <feep> high iq and conscientiousness? I guess, but like
[22:07:14] <feep> if you're in this channel..
[22:07:15] <gwern> I think it's a risky thing to say because people will cargocult it, and also most people aren't remotely smart or hardworking enough to even reach basic musk starting points like being admitted to stanford. but I don't believe it is anything ludicrous like 'musk was just born on a redcarpet paved with emeralds'
[22:07:20] <shawwwn> Emerald mine. Stanford
[22:07:26] <gwern> are you thinking at all?
[22:07:28] <feep> musk: born with stanford
[22:07:58] <rmmh> there are plenty of people with much more dynastic inheritance than musk that don't become billionaires
[22:08:01] <catern> shawwwn: no no, I'm not asking about C++ minutiae, you misunderstood, someone *else* asked *me* about C++ minutiae
[22:08:03] <shawwwn> Yes, “born with Stanford” is a reasonable approximation. Your parents either set you on that trajectory or they don’t
[22:08:09] <catern> shawwwn: when I was interviewing at a different company
[22:08:13] <shawwwn> catern: ahh
[22:08:22] <gwern> the emerald mine was simply a dubious investment his estranged asshole father made, which had zero relevance to musk's life even in south africa, never mind how he got into stanford or learned to program
[22:08:26] <shawwwn> I thought you were doing interviews as in giving them
[22:08:27] <feep> so we've moved from "emerald mine" to "good parenting"?
[22:08:35] <catern> yes it's quite ambiguous
[22:08:50] <feep> but I think at that point you've given up the objection
[22:09:09] <feep> if it's parenting, it's developmental; if it's developmental, it can be trained
[22:09:26] <shawwwn> Why would that be giving up objection? You don’t influence your life outcome at age 9
[22:09:29] <gwern> (not like emeralds are even that profitale or expensive, you know. it's sort of like silver: the connotations and glamor of the word 'silver' far outweighs any real economic impact as a source of wealth)
[22:09:29] <shawwwn> Your parents do
[22:09:55] <rmmh> feep: Educational Privilege!!!
[22:10:14] <shawwwn> I think reading about the lives of peasants would give you a nice reality check. Yes, educational privilege is correct
[22:10:48] <shawwwn> You’re a product of your circumstances far more than you’d like to admit
[22:11:11] <shawwwn> Because admitting it would undermine the idea of the lone genius and all the Hard Work you put in
[22:11:23] <shawwwn> Like *redacted because personal*
[22:11:24] <rmmh> nobody is saying that
[22:11:38] <rmmh> we're just saying that *financially* it doesn't appear to be the primary driver
[22:11:58] <gwern> when I was reading about musk the other year when the emerald mine hatchetjobs were coming up, my overall impression was that I admired Musk even more. I had vaguely assumed that his backstory was more or less similar to Bill Gates, modulo some foreign flavor. but no, musk was *poor*
[22:12:27] <shawwwn> finances almost don’t matter at all. Of course it matters, but if you dropped Elon’s financial situation into the lap of some random American, it would be squandered within a year
[22:12:27] <gwern> it really emphasizes the incredible luck of his lifestyle: to escalate from that to 'richest man in the world' by repeatedly betting *everything*
[22:12:36] <gwern> * life history
[22:12:52] <rmmh> gwern: a series of "10x or nothing" bets, really
[22:12:58] <shawwwn> Musk was not poor. You’re delusional
[22:13:12] <gwern> (someone like bill gates starts at like 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than musk, which means that musk won even more double-or-nothing risky bets than you think beforehand)
[22:13:18] <shawwwn> And the best response to delusional people is to smile and nod
[22:13:45] <gwern> (which to be fair is completely consistent with musk's life style and personality, going back to early on like peter thiel talking about how musk nearly killed them both in his new sportscar)
[22:14:13] <saturn3> winning a bunch of risky bets isn't the same thing as hard work
[22:14:23] <shawwwn> Thank you
[22:14:24] <gwern> you only get the risky bets because you work hard
[22:14:28] <shawwwn> Bullshit
[22:14:31] <gwern> working-hard is tablestakes
[22:14:43] <shawwwn> That’s not the same argument
[22:14:59] <shawwwn> Working hard is tablestakes. Which means it’s not special
[22:15:05] <gwern> the risky bets are on top of the working-hard, while saturn3 is implying that musk was only taking risks
[22:15:20] <rmmh> does anyone really think musk or gates or bezos got there by luck or family or hard work alone?
[22:15:35] <rmmh> (or genetics)
[22:15:38] <shawwwn> No. But I think family played a crucial role
[22:15:44] <gwern> rmmh: bezos also has a pretty damn wealthy background too. of the 3, musk owes the least to family, by a long shot
[22:15:51] <rmmh> yeah
[22:15:52] <saturn3> lots of people work very hard and are paid a pittance
[22:15:52] <shawwwn> And that this role in modern times is downplayed severely
[22:16:43] <shawwwn> I’ll believe you once someone rises to those echelons without being Ivy League. Funny that everyone says it doesn’t matter at all, and yet the correlations are pretty much 100%
[22:16:53] <gwern> stanford is not ivy league
[22:17:13] <gwern> (plus the whole dropping out thing already discussed)
[22:17:21] <shawwwn> Oh ooops sorry my bad, it’s only one of the most prestigious institutions in modern history
[22:17:36] <feep> of which he *dropped out after two days*.
[22:17:48] <shawwwn> Dropping out is irrelevant. Zuck dropped out too. They were still admitted in the first place
[22:17:52] <feep> like, you really think that opened doors? like, countersignaling?
[22:17:54] <shawwwn> They passed the filter.
[22:18:03] <shawwwn> Yes I think filters open doors.
[22:18:09] <gwern> filters on what? I thought we were still denying individual traits
[22:18:32] <feep> I will admit that is at least a thesis that doesn't obviously collapse
[22:18:36] <shawwwn> If you think the filter is based on individual merit, we’ll have to agree to disagree and move on
[22:18:37] <feep> glad we have arrived at this after like an hour
[22:18:54] <gwern> feep: oh no, it doesn't obviously collapse, but it does when you look at regression discontinuities and cutoffs
[22:19:05] <adiabatic> shawwwn: so they were appealing candidates to Stanford and were admitted…so?
[22:19:24] <gwern> (the filter *doesn't* open doors because people just below the filter have essentially identical outcomes)

[22:19:44] <gwern> (I'm pretty firmly convinced that in most worlds, musk would be a nonentity or dead by this point, considering how many stacked risky bets and pushing way harder than anyone else he does... which makes me wonder: spacex seems like it was not inevitable in the sense that we could just be dragging along with United indefinitely, but electric cars, because of batteries, were inevitable -...

[22:20:09] <rmmh> gwern: yeah, or even just being born +/- 5 years
[22:20:46] <kuudes> shawwwn, I guess we are both overproduced elites and try to not cause revolution :D
[22:20:50] <gwern> shawwwn: yes, they do. this has been done for higher ed, and for things like magnet highschools. if you look at the individuals who are like 1 point below admission, or who hit the cutoff but are not accepted for other reasons
[22:20:51] <adiabatic> I know a Stanford grad. he's smart but not super duper notable. Last I checked he was a manager or consultant or something and probably doing it very well, but he's not gonna get his name in the paper anytime soon

[22:21:26] <saturn3> the regular automakers would still be making ridiculously impractical hydrogen fuel prototypes that nobody would ever buy
[22:21:27] <shawwwn> adiabatic: no one argued that every Stanford grad was destined for influence
[22:21:28] <adiabatic> Musk and Gates and Zuck are all weirdly successful __by Stanford norms__
[22:21:54] <shawwwn> Yes. And almost 0% of the population will get anywhere close to Stanford norms
[22:21:54] <adiabatic> My point is that Stanford itself isn't much of a booster (also, what gwern said)
[22:22:04] <saturn3> and probably some battery+gas hybrids
[22:22:09] <shawwwn> So it’s absurd to say that people should try to “be like Musk” or any other such nonsense
[22:22:21] <kuudes> saturn3, yes
[22:22:29] <shawwwn> adiabatic: that argument doesn’t follow
[22:22:42] <kuudes> shawwwn, hmm, did someone say so? I guess I maybe?
[22:22:44] <feep> people should absolutely try to be like musk
[22:23:00] <kuudes> I am unsure
[22:23:06] <kuudes> given most people can't be like him
[22:23:07] <shawwwn> ok, I will try to inherit an emerald mine
[22:23:13] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: huh? what exactly do you like about musk?
[22:23:21] <shawwwn> And to drop out of Stanford
[22:23:24] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, I think shawwwn makes perfect sense
[22:23:27] <kuudes> I like him making electric cars PapuaHardyNet
[22:23:35] <kuudes> I also hope he solves climate change soon
[22:23:42] <adiabatic> I think his work ethic is pretty good.
[22:23:42] <kuudes> and takes humanity to mars
[22:23:44] <feep> shawwwn: be ambitious, start companies, form beliefs about things that are possible and commit to them
[22:23:44] * shawwwn goes to shower
[22:24:00] <gwern> (you should try to be like Musk, and then when you introspect, realize to what extent that's impossible and go do something that you can be like; those who pass the filter of being able to be musk-like should then go and actually become musk-like)
[22:24:34] <gwern> (what's the saying? "try, try, and try again; and then if it doesn't work, go do something else - no sense being a fool about it")
[22:24:42] <PapuaHardyNet> being musk-like requires a combination of intelligence and ruthlessness and wealth that isn't easy to get tbh
[22:24:48] <catern> perhaps Musk's general weirdness is a result of his poor background
[22:24:54] <PapuaHardyNet> poor what
[22:24:57] <feep> it's not easy to get and almost everyone will fail
[22:25:04] <catern> he's not coming from wealth and refinement like other tech billionaires
[22:25:08] <feep> they should do it anyway
[22:25:20] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: he came from wealth. I don't see how you can call him poor
[22:25:28] <saturn3> there's only one musk though, the second-best musk is hardly comparable
[22:25:41] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: I uh, advise you to read the history section on his wiki page :P
[22:25:51] <saturn3> so your base rate of being a musk is pretty damn low
[22:25:52] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: I read his bio :P
[22:25:54] <adiabatic> we could use another Musk
[22:26:17] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: fair nuf, I don't see in which sense you mean "came from wealth" then
[22:26:22] <adiabatic> like I said about the legend of Korra: 80% as good as the bestest thing ever is still pretty good
[22:26:29] <ggreer> for every wealthy kid who became a multibillionaire, there are plenty of poor kids who became multimillionaires. eg: qasar younis
[22:26:46] <PapuaHardyNet> well, if your dad owned an emerald mine and you came to the united states with emeralds in your pocket, you sure as hell aren't poor
[22:26:50] <ggreer> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasar_Younis
[22:26:51] <Robomot> Qasar Younis - Wikipedia (Qasar Younis is a Pakistani American entrepreneur and venture capitalist. He was the co-founder CEO of Talkbin (acquired by Google), and is the former COO of Y Combinator. He left Y Combinator in March 2017 to start Applied Intuition, a technology company that is building advanced softwares and infrastructure tools for self-driving vehicles.[1] …)
[22:27:46] <ggreer> he grew up in pakistan living in a place with dirt floors. moving to detroit was actually a huge life improvement
[22:28:08] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:28:40] <PapuaHardyNet> and how did he emigrate to detroit
[22:29:49] <PapuaHardyNet> lol that citation for his wikipedia for his early life? It is a broken link
[22:30:53] <rmmh> ggreer: hard work and a little planning is usually sufficient to become multimillionaires
[22:31:03] <gwern> he didn't own it, little of whatever the father got went to him, the emeralds weren't worth much which is why he was so poor (again emeralds are not actually that scarce *or* valuable and you should be asking yourself why he is doing something so bizarre as in-kind transactions rather than actual real money)...
[22:32:09] <gwern> lot of scams around emerald too incidentally, https://www.wired.com/2017/03/curse-bahia-emerald-giant-green-rock-wreaks-havoc-ruins-lives/ was interesting: 'Right now, in a vault controlled by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, there sits a 752-pound emerald with no rightful owner.

[22:32:15] <gwern> ...worth range from a hundred bucks to $925 million.' 
[22:33:49] <PapuaHardyNet> I am biased against the just world fallacy tbh. if you spin a story about the great american dream, I'd ignore it given any flimsy excuse
[22:33:54] <ggreer> PapuaHardyNet: you doubt that he was poor as fuck growing up?
[22:34:04] <PapuaHardyNet> that is correct
[22:34:44] <ggreer> I'm not sure what to tell you then. plenty of super rich people started off poor. kinda like how an odd number of them had a parent die early in life
[22:35:10] <rmmh> https://www.thecoldwire.com/was-elon-musk-born-rich/ Right after graduating, Musk started creating his first software called Zip2 with $2,000 that his brother and his friend loaned him while partnering with him.
[22:35:11] <Robomot> Was Elon Musk Born Rich? (Complete Story) (You may have wondered, was Elon Musk born rich? We answer this question along with the complete story of Elon Musk.)
[22:35:16] <rmmh> AHA the smoking gun: it was family wealth
[22:35:26] <ggreer> haha
[22:35:57] <rmmh> "He took out about $100 thousand in student loans to study programming at the University of Pennsylvania.
[22:36:52] <kuudes> someone actually has paid their student loans in usa? shocku
[22:37:19] <rmmh> it's not that uncommon. I did it
[22:37:42] <kuudes> you lazy millenials! why can't you be like musk and found a space unicorn instead of eating avocado sandwiches?!
[22:38:01] <rmmh> (man, I probably had more familial support than musk in college. my grandpa gave me $30k)
[22:38:33] <ggreer> kuudes: you have to. it's one of the few things you can't declare bankruptcy on
[22:38:39] <kuudes> yeah
[22:38:50] <rmmh> ggreer: there's that scheme where you pay a set income-based amount for 10 years and they forgive the rest
[22:39:10] <kuudes> in bush period after the subprime crisis they tried to ban much of bancrupcies in general
[22:39:13] <adiabatic> yeah, but who does that other than lambda school
[22:39:37] <kuudes> I wonder if someone has sued it as unconstitutional btw?
[22:43:26] <ggreer> I know people who started off poor and managed to get cushy programming jobs. I don't see why some aren't luckier and end up making tons of money starting a company
[22:44:25] <ggreer> airbnb was literally started because the founders needed rent money
[22:45:08] <gwern> people don't like risk-taking, they get very comfortable where they are... can you imagine how much more money programmers would make these days if they simply followed patio11's salary-negotiation guide and changed jobs more often?
[22:45:38] <adiabatic> ggreer: that takes business sense. not everyone's into that
[22:45:39] <mst> ggreer: depends *how* poor, too
[22:45:47] <ggreer> once they realized they had a decent business, they racked up $20k of credit card debt to fund growth, then paid off the $20k quickly by making 1,000 boxes of obama-o's and captain mccain crunch
[22:45:54] <mst> ggreer: a programming job usually comes with health insurance, starting a company doesn't
[22:45:55] <adiabatic> business skills are orthogonal to day-job skills
[22:46:11] <rmmh> mst: if you're young and unmarried you don't care
[22:46:26] <mst> rmmh: only a sith speaks in absolutes
[22:46:42] <rmmh> as jobs said "stay young. stay hungry"
[22:46:45] <adiabatic> I'm a counterexample to what rmmh said but by and large he's right
[22:47:00] <gwern> (if you're a fast-food worker, compensation is largely out of your hands beyond the basics like "don't get fired" and "work more/less jobs"'; even if you hustle, how much could you change your income the first year? $10k? $20k max? if you're a programmer, you could easily be passing up $100k+ a year just by staying at a job or accepting the first salary offer)
[22:47:33] <rmmh> gwern: for a period of time in seattle Oracle Cloud was paying 2x more than Google to poach programmers
[22:47:47] <ggreer> makes sense. who the hell wants to work for oracle?
[22:47:58] <rmmh> people talk a lot about FB having to pay a premium but they have *nothing* on Oracle lmao
[22:48:50] <rmmh> gwern: the other trick tech workers do is, given sufficient connections, jumping to a company that's about to be acquired or go public
[22:49:28] <gwern> does that really work? I thought that was a bad time to jump because the options will have been cut down to little and acquirers allocate retention bonuses on age
[22:49:40] <ggreer> I wonder if oracle has tried making a shell company to pay people less. kinda like how porn sites have legit-sounding shell companies so that people can put something on their resumes
[22:49:47] <rmmh> if you do it just right you can time it before they rework their options
[22:50:12] <ggreer> usually if IPO announcement is imminent, options will be lower. ditto for acquisition rumors
[22:50:26] <rmmh> yeah, it requires careful timing and connections to do insider job-trading
[22:50:36] <gwern> darn! the EMH strikes again!
[22:50:50] <ggreer> yeah
[22:51:08] <rmmh> as an easy example, my wife's company Tableau was being acquired by Salesforce (public knowledge), but they hadn't refigured their options grants for around a month
[22:51:26] <rmmh> so someone hopped over from Google and got a ludicrous stock grant
[22:51:39] <ggreer> that said, joining right before an acquisition or IPO is pretty fun. everyone hired afterwards is part of a different crowd

[22:54:08] <gwern> rmmh: gee, a month? dang, that's a fast hiring pipeline
[22:54:27] <gwern> at a lot of places you'd still be somewhere around second lunch
[22:55:04] <rmmh> you're kind of exploiting the crossed motives of the recruiter and the business types
[22:55:19] <rmmh> the recruiter will happily throw money at you as long as it doesn't affect _their_ metrics
[22:56:06] <gwern> so what do you do, tell the recruiter that "if I haven't put a signature on the final stock option paperwork 3 weeks from now, I'm bailing on you; get a move on, asshole"?
[22:57:39] <PapuaHardyNet> well, if it works...
[22:59:17] <ggreer> once a hiring decision has been made, the recruiter wants to close the deal ASAP. they only get paid if the worker gets hired
[22:59:58] <ggreer> I'm sure they exist, I don't know of any companies where the recruiter has input on the hiring decision. though usually it's only a couple weeks to go from "I have no idea this person exists" to "person is hired"
[23:00:51] <ggreer> larger companies are notorious for taking longer, though when I interviewed at google it was only two phone screens and one day of in person interviews. total time was maybe 3 weeks
[23:05:52] <gwern> hm. so maybe it works *because* they haven't been acquired/gone public

[23:46:00] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah uh, they didn't just look at URLs, now, did they/
[23:47:00] <gwern> [itchyjunk]: well, yes. there is very little reliable research or knowledge on programming languages outside of formal guarantees. we don't even know basic shit like whether static or dynamic typing is better at scale
