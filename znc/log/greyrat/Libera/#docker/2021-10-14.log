[10:52:57] <zoredache> Your wordpress container is on the https only

[10:54:34] <sultand> but shoudnt it just ssl offload?
[10:54:34] <zoredache> you have mixed some wrouters.wordpress, and routers.whoami
[10:54:55] <sultand> good catch
[10:55:19] <zoredache> Another thing that is useful is to enable the traefik dashboard
[10:55:27] <sultand> i have
[10:55:39] <sultand> works know ty
[10:55:53] <sultand> it was the wrouters :)

[12:29:07] <gordonjcp> raxor2k: well, it sounds like you're not entirely understanding something
[12:29:36] <gordonjcp> if you mount a directory as a volume, then that and all the directories within it will show up
[12:36:11] <raxor2k> docker run -d -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 -v ~/ai_prediction_api:/ai_prediction_api --env-file env_vars.env --name run_ai_prediction_api -p 5081:81 ai_prediction_api
[12:36:29] <raxor2k> this is how it was, and it gives me "error 2", no such file or directory  "trainedmodel/file
[12:36:34] <raxor2k> and then i did this: docker run -d -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 -v ~/ai_prediction_api:/ai_prediction_api -v ~/ai_prediction_api:/ai_prediction_api/transformation -v ~/ai_prediction_api:/ai_prediction_api/trained_model --env-file env_vars.env --name run_ai_prediction_api -p 5081:81 ai_prediction_api
[12:36:37] <raxor2k> and now it works
[12:36:46] <raxor2k> so i actually had to mount extra volumes ??
[12:47:23] <eyJhb> Anyone that has a simple elegant solution to allow a docker container to expose ports (that can be connected to from WWW), but the container itself cannot connect to anything, ie. cannot ping 8.8.8.8, fetch files, etc.?
[12:49:44] <gordonjcp> raxor2k: it sounds like your paths within your app are screwed
[12:51:30] <gordonjcp> raxor2k: without seeing what your directory structures are like it's hard to say but my guess is your app is looking for /path/to/app/trainedmodel/file and you're mounting /path/to/app/ai_prediction_api/trainedmodel/file

[16:29:38] <Furai> Is there a way to tell docker when mounting volume to bind it inside the volume to different folder? e.g. I have named_volume:/app. I know how to specify path in the container. And I assume that /app becomes / inside volume. I wonder if it's possible to change the path inside volume. No idea how it's named.
[16:30:10] <arash> any idea how to solve this ? https://0bin.net/paste/XdRV0WH+#RLHF9g5tDdbM4YOx7gYoynhC+w6QDXkjJvAqFWir6N3
[16:34:53] <tabakhase> Furai why would you want todo that? and pretty sure thats a nope
[16:35:32] <tabakhase> arash read the text...? "429 Too Many Requests - Server message: toomanyrequests: You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limit"
[16:36:37] <tabakhase> arash if thats you ci / you run into this regularry, consider mirroring images to your own registry or (likely even better) use a pull through cache https://docs.docker.com/registry/recipes/mirror/
[16:37:04] <tabakhase> otherwise just wait a bit to drop out of ratelimiting again :/
[16:37:46] <tabakhase> also https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/
[16:38:18] <tabakhase> "The rate limits of 100 container image requests per six hours for anonymous usage, and 200 container image requests per six hours for free Docker accounts"
[16:38:40] <Furai> I'm trying to avoid creating new persistent volumes in cloudformation in AWS. I thought that maybe it was possible to specify different path to mount inside volume. This way I could have e.g. /build-num inside volume which is transparently mounted to /app. I guess the only thing that's left is actually doing it in different place and symlinking the correct folder from volume.

[16:41:27] <tabakhase> Furai that sounds even more chaotic :D - what are you actually trhing to solve there...?
[16:43:41] <tabakhase> arash oh and as dirty-emergency-fix - pull it somewhere else, and then fetch it down to your host via some `ssh $fromSSH "docker save '$IMAGE' | gzip" |  gunzip | docker load` worm :P
[16:44:45] <Furai> The nature of our app makes it so we have to mount whole folder, aws has a problem with creating volumes for existing data, when it creates and mounts new volume, the target folder is empty (cause volume is empty, kind of overwrites it). The only solution to this problem is to copy in runtime files into volume. When we deploy new version of the app this will overwrite files of currently running
[16:44:47] <Furai> apps. So the only way around it would be to create new volume and copy it to new volume. But spinning up new volume takes a lot of time.

[17:15:26] <tabakhase> Furai thats a bit of a dirty one... - say you have a nginx & node backend, where you want nginx to deliver the compiled js "from disk" - the "simplest" one is to build both - and then use "COPY --from=myNodeImage ... ..." in nginx dockerfile - but this is a bit of orchestration and double restart so maybe not wanted - then the idea would be more "run nginx with volume /var/www , push same 
[17:15:27] <tabakhase> colume in node as "/nginx/www" and have nodes entrypoint do a rsync or so onto /nginx/www
[17:15:40] *** Joins: rewrit3 (~rewrit3@user/rewrit3)
[17:17:40] <tabakhase> so, simmilar how it would be "nodes job" to run a migration on your database - except that the "migration" is a rsync to update the files used by nginx
[17:20:39] <Furai> Ok, so, have you heard of nextjs and ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)? You can in it pre build some pages and generate static stuff and for other paths they're created on-the-fly. If I don't share that volume which has both pre-build and generated on fly pages then I'm assuming that different instances will try to generate this page on their own instead of serving already built ones.
[17:20:58] <Furai> Anyway, this topic is huge and we've been poking our heads at it for a longer while now.
[17:21:04] <Furai> Thank you for your help today.
[17:23:02] <gordonjcp> tabakhase: hang on, can you copy things from other Dockerfiles?
[17:24:24] <tabakhase> well other images, but yes
[17:24:45] <Furai> and multistage builds

[17:26:05] <tabakhase> Furai next yes, isr no... - but from what you wrote there, "technically that folder starts empty" and does NOT get updates from you updating the image --- but it also "kinda does" cause it allows to 'prebake some of that cache?' im understanding that somewhat correct?
[17:26:45] *** Joins: nvmd (~nvmd@user/nvmd)
[17:27:06] <Furai> Yeah, you can prebake cache for certain paths/pages. And then leave other to be cached when you visit them.
[17:27:32] <tabakhase> and just for the record, how much data were talkn there? - is that half a mb in 4 files - or half a gig spread in 50-folder-deep struts? :D
[17:27:36] <Furai> That's why we wanted to share that cache folder in volume.
[17:28:04] <Furai> Uh, TBH, no idea yet. 
[17:29:51] <Furai> I think we might end up with one docker with pm2 inside. I know it kind of defeats the purpose but apparently nextjs processes talk to each other.
[17:30:47] <Furai> Anyway, seems like vercel has all the knowledge how to properly load balance their product and they're not really willing to share it. 
[17:30:52] <Furai> Like just host it on our platform.
[17:31:04] <tabakhase> if its "reasonable" id prob still go the way to rsync it... (with/without masks/--delete is some reseach on how it validates) - and then just move around that folder in the "node build" - alla "RUN npm b && mv dest /usr/src/keep", then use "real path" with the volume and let entrypoint "move it back in place"
[17:33:13] <tabakhase> so same as above still, just instead of "sync /app/dest to /nginx/www" a "sync /usr/src/keep back to /app/dest"

[21:55:59] <tabakhase> as long as its a real one, there likely isnt much else then getting more ram - or i guess add SWAP if that takes it
[21:57:11] <tabakhase> and kinda with that, "where is your 4gig free" info from? - maybe even throw the dmesg on a paste :/
