[05:26:47] <jmes> I have a source file in my asdf registry and it is listed as a component in a system installed in the registry but it is not recognized by (asdf:find-system 'system-name). Any tips on figuring this out?
[05:30:52] <jmes> If it helps, I'm specifically trying to use fset which depends on the :gmap component from misc-extensions. I get a this missing dependency error: Component :GMAP not found, required by #<SYSTEM "fset">

[07:33:07] <beach> Good morning everyone! 
[07:33:27] <beach> jmes: Are you still around?
[07:34:30] <beach> jmes: Can you be a bit more concrete about "a source file", "my registry", "'system-name", etc.?
[07:35:37] <beach> If I understand you right, you are trying to use a single component from a different system?  ASDF doesn't support that as far as I know.

[10:03:22] <jmes> beach: good morning :) I was out for a bit but I'm back. The source file is a lisp file (gmap.lisp) distributed with https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/misc-extensions/devel/. I've installed it to /usr/share/common-lisp/{source,systems} which is where my asdf successfully finds other files
[10:08:35] <jmes> beach: perhaps this log can help? http://dpaste.com/CBW26ERLL
[10:10:27] <beach> Like I said, you can't refer to a Common Lisp source file in one system that is in a directory for a different system, which is what it sounds like you are doing.
[10:11:40] <beach> If you have a system that contains (:file "name") then "name.lisp" must be a file in the directory of that system.
[10:13:31] <jmes> Okay, so in this case fset depends-on misc-extensions, which contains the gmap.lisp file, but since gmap doesn't belong to fset directly it cannot use it?
[10:14:16] <beach> I really can't understand what you are doing from your descriptions so far.  
[10:14:40] <jmes> I am probably misunderstanding something very basic in your eyes so forgive me, I'm completely new to asdf. I'll try to give more context
[10:14:47] <beach> I can't tell which things are systems, which things are Common Lisp files, where they are located.
[10:15:18] <beach> Is misc-extensions a system?
[10:15:52] <jmes> Yes, it is a system for which gmap is listed as a component, I'll paste the asd file
[10:16:16] <jmes> http://dpaste.com/8WZMJTFCN
[10:16:20] <beach> Then, if gmap.lisp belongs to that system, in order to have the gmap.lisp file compiled and loaded, you either need to depend on the misc-extensions system, or copy the file to the gmap.lisp file to the system that contains it as a component. 
[10:17:06] <beach> So then you need for your other systems to depend on misc-extensions.
[10:17:20] <jmes> Right, so here is the fset.asd file http://dpaste.com/5522PCJ6W which shows the dependency
[10:18:16] <jmes> but apparently it doesn't discover the gmap file, which stumped me
[10:18:52] <beach> What is it that you type when this error is signaled?
[10:19:12] <beach> So far you have told me (asdf:find-system 'system-name).
[10:19:46] *** Quits: dtman34 (~dtman34@c-73-62-246-247.hsd1.mn.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[10:20:42] <jmes> That was a mistaken example, sorry. What I'm really doing is this: (asdf:make :nyxt/gtk-application) which has fset as a dependency and then I guess fset fails to resolve its dependencies
[10:21:08] <beach> And you said that fset depends on a component in a different system, but then you were using "depends on" in a different way, which confused me.
[10:21:33] <beach> So does it find the fset system?
[10:22:50] <jmes> Yes sorry for my complete incompetence here :P Yes it finds fset supposedly because it knows what fset requires: Component :GMAP not found, required by #<SYSTEM "fset">
[10:23:22] <beach> It looks like it is finding a different fset system because the one you showed me does not depend on a gmap component.
[10:23:47] <beach> You may want to check the pathname of the fset system that it finds when you use find-system.
[10:24:29] <jmes> But the fset system depends on the misc-extensions system which contains gmap, is that not right?
[10:24:55] <beach> Yes, but you wouldn't get an error like that for this problem.
[10:25:03] <jmes> okay, let me check the path
[10:25:13] <beach> You would get an error that misc-extensions does not find the component.
[10:25:24] <beach> But the error you get is that fset can not find the component.
[10:25:27] <jmes> I see, that makes sense
[10:25:52] <beach> So it looks to me like the fset system you showed me is not the one it is finding.
[10:26:31] <jmes> That's exactly right
[10:26:48] <jmes> the upstream fset tarball contains 2 fset.asd files!
[10:26:52] <jmes> odd
[10:27:10] <jmes> the one I didn't show you depends on gmap
[10:27:25] <beach> That's what it looked like, yes.
[10:27:43] <jmes> So now I'm confused for another reason
[10:28:39] <jmes> if there are 2 fset.asd files, which should I trust? 
[10:28:59] <beach> That, I can't help you with.  I know nothing about these systems.
[10:29:08] <jmes> Yes I'm asking too much haha
[10:29:47] <jmes> I think I can safely remove the fset.asd that depends on gmap since it is in a deeper directory and depends on a specific component that the tarball did not include
[10:29:53] <jmes> so that must be a mistake upstream
[10:30:10] <beach> Good luck!
[10:30:28] <jmes> and the 'real' fset.asd depends on a system which includes gmap anyway
[10:30:33] <jmes> so I should be safe
[10:30:43] <jmes> Thanks so much, beach
[10:30:48] <beach> Pleasure.
