[00:21:22] <CalimeroTeknik> I have seen this guy in another channel with the same personality, but always on-topic; I believe he goes around doing that
[00:23:19] <Joanna> It kind of reminds me of other trolls that spam nonsense
[00:23:23] <CalimeroTeknik> his programming language design talk was just as nuts as this, and I suspect all of that he just said was a complete fable
[00:23:42] <Joanna> Could be a chat bot
[00:24:32] <CalimeroTeknik> oh, I haven't checked, but I'm a pretty good Turing test examiner
[00:24:58] <CalimeroTeknik> my after-the-fact judgement says it's a human
[00:25:59] <Joanna> Whatever it is it failed my standards of quality for chat.
[00:26:26] <CalimeroTeknik> when the "chatbot" can really react very well to questions, not just with content but with character, you know it's not artificial but manual
[00:26:36] <CalimeroTeknik> sure, that seemed very subpar
[00:28:25] <Joanna> I don’t care if it’s human or bot as long as it says things worth reading
[00:30:04] <Joanna> I’ve seen chat bots in here that are sort of incoherently talking tangentially about what others are discussing
[01:05:13] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: there are actually people paid by the government to get into social media and steer the narrative.
[01:06:16] <CalimeroTeknik> oh, sure, I've seen them as well, but I tend to confront them in a way that requires attention; if they cannot meet that expectation, they're kindly shown the door

[01:10:29] <Joanna> People who are crazy make good tools for sure. I don’t want to be judgmental which is why I started asking questions.
[01:10:59] <jan6> techlore is quite good
[01:11:41] <CalimeroTeknik> jan6, also https://github.com/afontenot/firefox-clean
[01:12:02] <CalimeroTeknik> and watch out for the downloads starting automatically now
[01:12:13] <Joanna> His style is similar to another crazy person who I quieted awhile back who was bragging about how he snuck out and got vaxxed again the wishes of his stupid family
[01:12:37] <CalimeroTeknik> I'm considering waterfox, because firefox is hostile to my privacy/reasonable power-user settings
[01:13:16] <CalimeroTeknik> yes, the bragging was through the roof, it's not particularly constructive in any imaginable way ^^
[01:14:56] <Joanna> Isn’t Firefox opensource?

[01:16:03] <jan6> sure, that's why waterfox and such exist
[01:16:10] <CalimeroTeknik> very much so, the term "open source" was even coined by Mozilla marketeers, as the FSF says, to mean "Free Software without the philosophy"
[01:16:31] <jan6> a noticeable amount of forks exist, but sadly chrome is overtaking everything
[01:16:32] <CalimeroTeknik> er, or was it "without the ethics", yes I think so
[01:16:48] <jan6> mozilla public license is one of the major open source licenses ;P
[01:16:54] <CalimeroTeknik> you can use the blink engine and it's not so awful I guess?
[01:18:01] <CalimeroTeknik> each time someone says "open source" instead of "free/libre software", the world misses an opportunity to talk about ethics in society
[01:18:55] <jan6> pff
[01:19:06] <jan6> you mean ARGUE about ethics ;P
[01:21:41] <jan6> also why waterfox instead of librewolf?

[02:05:41] <CalimeroTeknik> jan6, I don't know enough to answer the waterfox/librewolf thing, except perhaps that waterfox is less of a fork and more of a patchset following updates perhaps?
[02:05:45] <CalimeroTeknik> to be confirmed
[02:06:23] <jan6> pretty much all the forks are "patchsets" lol
[02:06:32] <jan6> but iirc, it's more the reverse
[02:06:54] <CalimeroTeknik> take palemoon: it's lagging behind, quite badly
[02:07:04] <jan6> palemoon is hard forked
[02:07:09] <CalimeroTeknik> it's not even "lagging" as it has forked completely
[02:07:19] <jan6> they're not lagging behind anymore, they're just not the same work anymore ;p
[02:07:45] <CalimeroTeknik> in fact, I'm currently rejecting browsers that implement their own rendering engine
[02:08:14] <jan6> AKA literally all browsers
[02:08:22] <CalimeroTeknik> making a browser is enough opinionated work already that it doesn't need to bother itself with the less opinionated work of an engine
[02:08:40] <jan6> *all GOOD browsers
[02:08:56] <jan6> making an engine is about as opinionated
[02:09:07] <CalimeroTeknik> there are more browsers than engines! there is firefox's (gecko or something) +servo coming maybe, blink and webkit
[02:09:13] <jan6> it's just way more transparent
[02:09:33] <jan6> every decision affects it just as much, but you don't visually *SEE* how it affects it
[02:09:54] <jan6> there's already too few engines
[02:10:14] <jan6> even Edge abandoned their own~
[02:11:07] <CalimeroTeknik> the elephant in the room is the monstrosity that this not-even-versioned thing has become https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
[02:11:24] <CalimeroTeknik> what kind of standard is a "living" one, really?
[02:11:39] <CalimeroTeknik> in my view that's as good as dead as a standard
[02:12:36] <CalimeroTeknik> when the standard becomes fully self-aware, you know some wrong decisions were taken ^^

[03:21:11] <Joanna> Hey juliaEnv welcome to channel
[03:21:49] <juliaEnv> thanks, Joanna. Interesting channel.
[03:22:42] <juliaEnv> out of curiosity, has anyone found more information on this Chinese technology? https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10355211/China-working-brain-control-weaponry-paralyze-control-opponents.html
[03:22:45] <Joanna> Programming channel has a lot of trolls mixed in with the smart people
[03:23:44] <jan6> that's the internet for you
[03:24:14] <juliaEnv> some of them seem to be Russians in this case manipulating (or trying to manipulate) people online
[03:24:21] <jan6> part of the problem is that a lot of the smart people also sometimes joke around trollishly ;P
[03:24:57] <juliaEnv> software developer are only smart at what they have trained. That is applied software development.
[03:24:58] <Joanna> There are definitely things that can cause entrainment and interfere with brain waves and thinking
[03:25:23] <juliaEnv> China is heavily working on this: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/us-blacklists-34-chinese-entities-over-human-rights-abuses-brain-control-weapons.html
[03:25:51] <Joanna> China isn’t the only one doing this research I’m sure
[03:26:51] *** Joins: Decker (~d3x0r@user/d3x0r)
[03:29:02] <juliaEnv> that's likely true. The risk is that China will share it with Russia and if they form an alliance they will abuse human rights together.
[03:29:34] <juliaEnv> https://insidearabia.com/the-us-cannot-allow-the-uae-to-procure-chinese-brain-control-weapons-part-2-of-2/
[03:31:03] <Joanna> Think of it this way. They already control most people pretty well through their TVs and phones and the school system
[03:31:58] <jan6> it's not exactly control, it's just conditioning
[03:32:15] <Joanna> Close enough
[03:32:24] <jan6> kiiiinda
[03:33:05] <Joanna> They have people going to join a losing military in Ukraine I’ve heard
[03:37:06] <juliaEnv> yes, in one book written by one leader, it says the news media are propaganda for the masses. So instead of thinking what the news say, one needs to study History as a subject to understand the history of Russia and their invasions, the reasons for them, and the outcomes as well as what the outcomes depend upon.
[03:38:22] <Joanna> You know what’s ironic about this whole thing. Remember a few years back when there was all that drama about holocaust deniers in Europe I think they even made it into a crime. Meanwhile over in Ukraine they were funding training up an army of people who think nazis are hero’s and want to emulate them.
[03:39:06] <Joanna> juliaEnv: it’s amazing how nobody pays attention to history isn’t it?
[03:41:10] <Joanna> To elaborate further the people convinced to be Nazis and murder people are also victims in this human chess game
[03:41:21] <juliaEnv> 1920 Russia invaded Azerbaijan, 1920 Russia invaded Armenia, 1921 Russia invaded Georgia, 1921 Russia invaded Mongolia, 1939 Germany and Russia invaded Poland, 1940 Soviets invaded Bessarabia and Bukovina, 1968 Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia, 2014 Russia invaded Ukrainian Crimea. There were more conflicts that I've left out.

[03:42:12] <juliaEnv> 1939 Russia invaded Finland...
[03:42:34] <Joanna> The is also talk that british and American bankers backed the Nazis Bolsheviks and Mao
[03:43:01] <jan6> one of the theories I've seen is that the "core" of russia is in a hard to defend, open place, which is why there's been many generations of the mentality that they need to conquer far enough out, to where they have natural borders that are easy enough to defent
[03:43:19] <jan6> *d
[03:43:49] <Joanna> Oh yea I’ve head the Russians didn’t bother to equip their troops that time and the Finnish lured hungry Russians into ambushes by cooking food
[03:44:40] * jan6 sleeps, it's night in estonia (omg, leaking location in #opsec, such heresy ;)
[03:44:41] <Joanna> Crimea is definitely easier to defend
[03:45:00] <Joanna> Nite
[03:45:54] <juliaEnv> OK, gn, Joanna
[03:46:00] <Joanna> My conclusion is people just like to have wars. Always have always will
[03:46:16] <Joanna> I was talking to Jan I’m still here :)
[03:46:25] <juliaEnv> oh, OK, good :)
[03:46:39] <juliaEnv> Joanna every person has self-interests and they are almost always in conflict with other peoples' interests
[03:47:02] <juliaEnv> so people achieve what they want using lying, deception, manipulation (called politics)
[03:47:56] <juliaEnv> and when they can't decieve the adversary to manipulate him using politics (lying, deception, manipulation), they use some leverage (strength based politics). That's what Putin likes to do.
[03:48:51] <Joanna> It’s kind of obvious what nato is up to after all these years. I remember when they destroyed Yugoslavia
[03:48:56] <juliaEnv> it involves threats, coercion, studying of laws/rules to work around them and to impose every rule on the adversary and insist that the adversary plays by the rules, etc.
[03:49:28] <juliaEnv> yes, it's clear. The real threat is China, though.
[03:49:38] <Joanna> And don’t forget getting other countries involved in your wars
[03:50:02] <juliaEnv> my wars?
[03:51:06] <Joanna> The funny thing about china is to ask how did it come to pass that most  manufacturing was moved to China ? Did world bank do it?
[03:51:32] <Joanna> juliaEnv: figure of speech
[03:51:33] <juliaEnv> it appears to have an answer in China's history

[03:53:56] <juliaEnv> cheap labor, country's enormous scale of operations, robust supply chain and raw materials ecosystem
[03:54:12] <Joanna> Before that there were the opium wars
[03:54:21] <juliaEnv> China has 1.4 billion people
[03:56:58] <juliaEnv> it appears the Chinese communist regime exploits their people largely as cheap labor to work in sweat shops for a low income. That's why it's cheaper to let them manufacture products than if other countries manufactured theirs.
[03:57:03] <Joanna> It’s not just the cheap labor it’s as if there was a concerted effort to move everything to China and make countries dependent upon china . I don’t know all the details but you would think that any government that wasn’t corrupt would have stopped this from happening just from the standpoint of citizens losing jobs alone.
[03:57:58] <juliaEnv> every CEO can decide for himself/herself where the manufacturing will take place. These decisions tend to be economical.
[03:58:10] <Joanna> It all makes sense for China to do this they get all the technology because they work cheap.
[03:58:18] <juliaEnv> it's applied economics (private owners decide)
[03:58:55] <Joanna> The government can put high tariffs on things imported if it wants to.
[03:59:10] <juliaEnv> yes, China usually gets to know everything that private owners from other countries want manufactured, incl. Apple, etc.
[03:59:26] *** Quits: MiningMarsh (~MiningMar@user/miningmarsh) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[03:59:28] <Joanna> The cheap fossil fuels didn’t help either.
[04:00:30] <Joanna> In other words the Chinese had a plan but they were also helped along by foreign investment most likely
[04:00:31] <juliaEnv> if products were manufactured in the same country that has invented them, they would cost for example 10x up to 30x more. A $100 product might cost $1000 or $3000.
[04:00:57] <juliaEnv> (I'm only guessing these numbers. I don't have a manufacturing market research to know exactly how much it would cost)
[04:02:18] <Joanna> Depending upon a 5000?  mile long supply line is a bad idea. As a result countries are helpless if anything goes wrong with China
[04:02:40] <juliaEnv> yes, Joanna. People in communist countries are too stressed from the dictatorship and arrogance/bad behavior towards them, so they usually can't invent anything on their own. In those environments, they can usually only do jobs that can be performed in bad conditions, in stress.
[04:04:03] <Joanna> I once read a book called when a billion Chinese jump that talked about how Americans can’t even make their own magnets anymore. There are no longer skilled workers or equipment to make things anymore.
[04:04:26] <juliaEnv> Maybe China's only chance to have access to all modern technology is to volunteer to manufacture it at low costs.
[04:04:31] *** Joins: MiningMarsh (~MiningMar@user/miningmarsh)
[04:04:44] <Joanna> The plan worked great
[04:05:41] <juliaEnv> Joanna Americans can manufacture everything. They are also capable and they have access to the best training money can buy. It's simply gonna make the end product more expensive, meaning customers will have to pay more for the same.
[04:06:00] <juliaEnv> it would result in less people having access to modern technology
[04:06:43] <Joanna> They could source it to South America that would be less risky
[04:07:45] <juliaEnv> that's true. Well, at this time it could still double the prices.
[04:08:22] <Joanna> I would much rather be self sufficient even if my standard of living is lower but I don’t speak for most people
[04:09:14] <juliaEnv> can you imagine all clothes, all electronics becoming several times more expensive, for example starting next week?
[04:09:44] <Joanna> A lot of the stuff made in China is just junk we can do without. I would be glad to pay twice as much and have things not break.
[04:10:16] <Joanna> I don’t mind the clothes part I can make my own
[04:11:09] <juliaEnv> they usually only break because the vendor has deliberately ordered the cheapest manufacturing process. He could have ordered a more expensive one, if he wanted to, and then the product would cost more. There are products that are low budget and also products that are high quality and expensive.
[04:11:40] <Joanna> The expense part I think is a bad trade off. If electronics were more expensive maybe they would be built to last longer instead of being designed to be obsolete
[04:11:57] <juliaEnv> it's usually possible, when you're a CEO, to say you want the highest quality materials (and then manufacturing 100 units will cost $$$) or that you want the cheapest materials (then it'll cost $).
[04:12:26] <Joanna> I prefer well made things that last a long time. It’s better for the environment also
[04:12:56] <juliaEnv> as a buyer, you can find the things you prefer in the today's market and avoid junk
[04:13:13] <juliaEnv> you can pay 10x more for the highest quality items already
[04:13:15] <Joanna> It’s all like potlatch tossing gifts into the fire to prove how rich you are
[04:14:18] <Joanna> I really can’t find things I prefer sometimes. They just don’t exist anymore. Like shoes without plastic parts for instance
[04:15:33] <juliaEnv> interestingly, every consumer has their preferrences and consumers can be grouped into segments.
[04:16:11] <juliaEnv> if everything becomes significantly more expensive without the income rising, it'll likely cause a civil unrest
[04:17:54] <juliaEnv> on one hand, China is using the money from the whole world to finance its self-interests (incl. war against Taiwan and against the world, possibly). On the other hand, the whole world has affordable products because of cheap labor and a huge population in China.
[04:18:57] <Joanna> If you want things made right you might have to make them yourself. The cheap computers we are fond of seem too good to be true and they are. They are being used to spy upon and control us more and more.
[04:19:03] <juliaEnv> the best idea is to focus on increasing our income, reduce our expenses, and learn to invest...
[04:20:14] <Joanna> A large portion of people’s income goes into taxes for things they don’t always benefit from
[04:20:39] <Joanna> It’s all just a big complicated mess
[04:21:16] <juliaEnv> it's just economics :)
[04:21:19] <Joanna> And of the long supply lines are cut millions will die. That’s not a good predicament to be in.

[04:21:38] <Joanna> Hey duuude :)
[04:21:55] <duuude> hi :)
[04:22:15] <Joanna> That was a lively discussion in other channel today
[04:22:50] <juliaEnv> well, we should ask ourselves what preceeded the world war. And we'll find from history it was the great depression. So, when things got too expensive that's what propelled a world war.
[04:24:14] <Joanna> juliaEnv: are you familiar with Corbett report? His podcast gives some good history lessons about ww1 and the federal reserve and the boer wars
[04:24:23] <juliaEnv> and we can find that as a pattern in social behavior also on a microlevel. When people find it's too expensive to buy what they need, they start to have a conflict about it and they fight.
[04:25:09] <juliaEnv> Joanna I'm not familiar with that. I lookup history selectively to answer ad-hoc questions.
[04:25:32] <Joanna> Often people are stirred up with propaganda like for ww1. Amazingly people will tolerate a lot of hardship without rebelling
[04:26:06] <Joanna> There are some links in topic.
[04:26:31] <Joanna> I like Wikipedia but some articles are biased
[04:27:17] <juliaEnv> Joanna to generalize, if you make everything more expensive because of bad advice from covid charlatans, and then you make everything more expensive because of bad advice from military charlatans, and then you make everything even more expensive because of fear of China you're likely to cause such a great depression that people will have a conflict because of the prices all the time and that's how a war starts.
[04:27:25] <Joanna> The purpose of ww1 was to destroy Germany so it wouldn’t compete with England
[04:28:09] <Joanna> It’s easy to manipulate people who are unhappy for sure
[04:28:42] <juliaEnv> not if they can't meet their basic needs
[04:28:52] <juliaEnv> i.e. pay rent and food, etc.
[04:29:32] <Joanna> You are describing a war of necessity like if you are starving you attack country nearby to steal their food
[04:29:57] <juliaEnv> yes
[04:30:06] <juliaEnv> or to steal their territory
[04:30:44] <juliaEnv> Ukraine was estimated to possess natural gas reserves of over 1 trillion cubic meters,[1] and was ranked 26th among countries with proved reserves of natural gas[2] before Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in 2014. Its total gas reserves have been estimated at 5.4 trillion cubic meters
[04:30:59] <Joanna> People being poor then the government saying let’s have a war here are some high paying jobs making weapons . The same government could have done something else to make jobs
[04:31:34] <Joanna> There is also the navy base there
[04:31:44] <juliaEnv> https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ukraines-gas-reserves-95-bln-cubic-metres-production-continues-pm-2022-03-12/
[04:31:51] <Joanna> Their only warm water port
[04:32:29] <juliaEnv> it appears anger/depression (emotions) naturally lead to a war instead of doing something else
[04:33:29] <juliaEnv> in general you're right
[04:33:36] <Joanna> People who are unhappy get taken advantage of in many ways
[04:34:01] <Joanna> Have you ever seen a bullfight?
[04:34:03] <juliaEnv> I suspect Russia felt the impact of bad covid advice that has costed them. So, Russia has decided to steal something for profit.
[04:34:39] <juliaEnv> Ukraine is hugely profitable when stolen. It has billions cubic meters.
[04:34:43] <Joanna> I don’t think it’s about profit it’s more about control and security.
[04:34:56] <juliaEnv> in my view, it's strictly about power and money
[04:35:13] *** duuude is now known as opaquebrokengoo
[04:35:15] <Joanna> Well same goes for NATO
[04:35:58] <juliaEnv> if NATO would free Ukraine from Russian criminals, gas/energy would become cheaper.
[04:36:21] <Joanna> Russians don’t want nukes in Ukraine pointed at them. Imagine if Mexico hosted russian missiles?
[04:36:26] <juliaEnv> if Russia conquers Ukraine, gas/energy will become even more expensive
[04:37:05] <juliaEnv> I don't believe that argumentation because there are already other countries that have nukes ready to strike Russia right now
[04:37:11] <Joanna> People should reduce their reliance on fossil fuels
[04:37:32] <juliaEnv> in my view, everything Russia does is economy-based, at this time because of covid charlatans who have costed Russia more than it could afford
[04:37:35] <Joanna> Other countries aren’t as close are they ?
[04:38:29] <juliaEnv> IDK, I kind of only care about Sweden and the US :)
[04:38:31] <Joanna> Why did russia go along with the Covid stuff? I’ve heard they have a corrupt company making their vax
[04:38:58] <juliaEnv> because corrupt charlatans (doctors of medicine) in Russia decided so
[04:38:59] <opaquebrokengoo> Russia did the first vax
[04:39:00] <Joanna> Sweden didn’t lock down
[04:39:17] <opaquebrokengoo> and it was effective, it is deployed worldwide
[04:39:29] <juliaEnv> yes, that's because Sweden seems to be the only country in the world that has a government valuing the people
[04:39:53] <Joanna> There are theories that all the countries being enemies is just a big show and they are all up to no good in collusion...
[04:39:56] <opaquebrokengoo> meanwhile due to misinformation the vaccination rate in Russia is pretty low
[04:40:26] <juliaEnv> Chinese lockdowns were baseless, without any impact on the new type of flu and without any scientific study. Chinese communists have decided to lockdown and to censor all evidence that it isn't working, and to pretend that it works.
[04:40:54] <Joanna> Belarus didn’t lockdown
[04:41:39] <juliaEnv> that's what corrupt charlatans in other countries copied from China and imposed it on people, together with Asian folk knowledge of wearing masks. Chinese people have been wearing masks for many years. They are also baseless. Scientific studies show that there is not any statistically significant effect of masks on the spread of flu.
[04:42:13] <Joanna> Nope
[04:42:24] <Joanna> I hate masks
[04:42:55] <juliaEnv> I estimate approx. 20% of knowledge that is called "medicine" is science-based and 80% is opinions of charlatans (doctors of medicine who pretend to have knowledge and skills that they don't posses).
[04:43:25] <Joanna> Rockefellers took over medicine awhile back
[04:44:09] <juliaEnv> almost in 100% of cases, if you want to do what's good for your health, it tends to be the exact opposite of what a charlatan would advise
[04:44:46] <juliaEnv> I mean you're gonna be healthier if you ignore everything doctors of medicine say
[04:45:02] <Joanna> I avoid them
[04:45:11] <Joanna> And drugs in general
[04:45:19] <juliaEnv> and if you go to gym and eat healthy (nutritionists can advice on what to eat, doctors of medicine can't because they don't know anything)
[04:46:15] <Joanna> I don’t really trust advice from anyone besides Weston price
[04:46:35] <juliaEnv> yes, drugs are almost always various toxic poisons that have as their side-effect an impact on something in the body. They almost always cause harm, just like the charlatans peddling these drugs
[04:47:34] <juliaEnv> importantly, our economy is bad world-wide because of the media in the first place. Of course when money grubbing charlatans get a chance, they jump on the train of making higher profits.
[04:47:39] <Joanna> But most people believe in them
[04:48:01] <juliaEnv> yes, manipulation works on most people
[04:48:15] <Joanna> Were you ever on freenode?
[04:48:19] <juliaEnv> yes
[04:48:37] <Joanna> Maybe we met before. Do you remember me ?
[04:49:02] <juliaEnv> not sure. Was your nickname the same as now?
[04:49:10] <Joanna> Similar
[04:49:18] <juliaEnv> what was it?
[04:49:26] <Joanna> Jo anna
[04:49:40] <juliaEnv> yes, seems familiar
[04:50:12] <juliaEnv> interesting. What country do you live at?
[04:50:19] <Joanna> Did you go to coronavirus-vox
[04:50:23] <juliaEnv> nope
[04:50:28] <Joanna> I’m over in Asia
[04:50:40] <juliaEnv> OK, I'm in Sweden
[04:50:56] <Joanna> How is Sweden these days?
[04:51:51] <Joanna> There was someone from Sweden on freenode named fcx5
[04:56:43] <juliaEnv> Sweden is still the best country. No masks, no lockdowns, good people.
[04:57:46] <juliaEnv> the only trouble is we have some Ukrainians now. You know, they are rude, loud, live too many people in one room, and they generally hate people because they are from a (post?)communist country.
[04:58:27] <juliaEnv> in fact, I see no difference between Ukrainians and Russians in terms of their behavior. No difference at all.
[04:59:28] <juliaEnv> Joanna I'd be happy if both Ukraine and Russia stayed in Eastern Europe and didn't "invade" Western Europe.
[05:00:32] <Joanna> Ukrainians are russians pretty much
[05:00:35] <juliaEnv> there are also Russians going to burst into Western countries, possibly by millions
[05:01:17] <juliaEnv> it's a complete disaster what the media are doing, and what leaders in western countries are doing.
[05:01:37] <Joanna> The refugees are used as a weapon to destabilize.
[05:02:14] <Joanna> I’ve heard Sweden has a lot of problems with refugees making crime ?
[05:02:18] <juliaEnv> Russians and Ukrainians are among the worst people to have as your neighbors
[05:02:38] <Joanna> What do they do ?
[05:03:22] <juliaEnv> they hate people, cheat, steal, break all rules/work around all laws, and they spend their lives parasiting on and cheating others.
[05:03:39] <juliaEnv> there are some exceptions, but this is the standard in Russia/Ukraine
[05:04:25] <juliaEnv> Sweden is among the least corrupt countries. Ukraine and Russia are extremely corrupt compared to that. So, these people are complete criminals by Swedish standards.
[05:05:04] <Joanna> Sounds like a Romanian talking about Gypsies
[05:05:38] <juliaEnv> in order to fit in the West, Ukrainians/Russians would need to study at a Western university.
[05:06:07] <juliaEnv> in Sweden, college/university is free. But do you think Ukrainians/Russians come here to study?
[05:06:43] <Joanna> I’ve heard Russians don’t trust their government but who knows I don’t have any Russians to get info from
[05:07:33] <juliaEnv> in my view, they will establish Ukrainian gangs and Russian gangs and after some time I'm afraid they will corrupt it here, if they will be enough million people
[05:07:45] <Joanna> We will see what happens after russian finishes it’s operation in Ukraine
[05:08:01] <juliaEnv> it's all about what China does
[05:08:16] <juliaEnv> https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/17/asia/taiwan-military-reservists-china-fears-intl-hnk/index.html
[05:08:43] <Joanna> Do you have gangs there already? I’ve heard some neighborhoods in Sweden police don’t dare go
[05:09:02] <juliaEnv> ideally, Western countries would say they don't want Ukrainians and that Eastern countries neighboring with Ukraine should take all refugees.
[05:09:22] <juliaEnv> it's gonna be nothing but trouble. Believe me.
[05:10:03] <juliaEnv> Swedish police is as corrupt as possible in other countries... Of course Swedish police is already involved in every possible gang around here.
[05:10:10] <Joanna> The Russians don’t seem to mind refugees from Ukraine
[05:10:41] <juliaEnv> it's a nonsense when Putin dictates there
[05:11:08] <juliaEnv> well, Ukrainians should all disperse in Eastern European countries
[05:11:45] <Joanna> The Ukrainians have no chance of beating russian
[05:12:05] <juliaEnv> to me, it's like russians fighting russians, and the media bullshitting about it
[05:12:44] <Joanna> It’s not worth spending money on for sure.
[05:13:52] <juliaEnv> well, everything got more expensive and dangerous because of the media and their covid excess, and now because of their war excess. The initial reaction of NATO was right (no support) and the today's reaction is heavily influenced by the crooked media
[05:14:45] <Joanna> I think they will escalate to nuclear war in Europe
[05:14:51] <Joanna> Possibly
[05:14:57] <juliaEnv> Ukrainians can disperse in Eastern European countries if they want to, or die fighting Russians. Nobody will miss them.
[05:15:10] <juliaEnv> and nobody will miss Russia 
[05:15:34] <juliaEnv> but if Russians and Ukrainians disperse into Western countries, it'll be devastating
[05:15:39] <Joanna> Russians have beautiful buildings
[05:16:26] <Joanna> Nato prolonging the war will definitely disperse them
[05:17:16] <Joanna> Nato will probably spread war to Europe
[05:18:01] <juliaEnv> well, Russia has 145 million people and I estimate that more than a half want to flee... Ukraine has 43 million and I estimate that 40 million want to flee. That's at least some 100 million Ukrainians/Russians who want to flee, and I estimate at least half of them want to "invade" Western countries, if not more just because they are given that opportunity.
[05:18:48] <Joanna> How do you know they want to flee? Did you talk to them ?
[05:19:40] <juliaEnv> I estimate that based on observation
[05:20:24] <Joanna> But you use American news sources
[05:20:43] <juliaEnv> would you not want to flee if you were Russian and your credit card stopped working, your currency fell 50% in two weeks and kept falling, many companies stopped operating in your country within 2 weeks, thousands would get arrested for protesting the war, etc. Would you not want to flee the sanctions?
[05:20:45] <Joanna> Unless we talk to actual Russians we can’t know
[05:21:26] <juliaEnv> and Ukrainians want to flee, they are hiding in various buildings, often without enough food/water
[05:21:30] <Joanna> I heard they found a workaround with a chinese bank for credit cards
[05:21:41] <juliaEnv> yes, China and Russia became allies
[05:21:49] <juliaEnv> Putin wants to launch "cryptoruble"
[05:22:04] <juliaEnv> in practice, that means all the repulsive, disgusting, criminal behavior of those crooks moving out of Russia/Ukraine to Western countries
[05:22:05] <Joanna> I’ve heard Ukrainians are being prevented from fleeing from cities
[05:22:19] <juliaEnv> only some
[05:22:35] <juliaEnv> almost 2 million have already fled
[05:23:30] <juliaEnv> well, nobody will like Russians/Ukrainians as his/her neighbors. I can gurantee that.
[05:23:55] <juliaEnv> when all of a sudden, they move into an apartment next door, your piece/comfort ends.
[05:23:56] <Joanna> Do you have russian neighbor?
[05:24:15] <juliaEnv> maybe I have some Russian or Ukrainian family that has moved last week.
[05:24:20] <juliaEnv> moved in
[05:24:53] <Joanna> What happened?
[05:25:14] <juliaEnv> living 3 people in one room, making noise, smashing everything, being rude all day, bickering/arguing, their kid being rude/crazy, screaming and running back and forth. Terrible.
[05:25:38] <Joanna> How old are they?
[05:25:41] <juliaEnv> basically, their behavior is not compatible with Western countries
[05:26:14] <juliaEnv> IDK, I estimate they are in their 40's and the kid maybe 6
[05:26:23] <Joanna> Your places only have one room?
[05:27:13] *** Joins: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23)
[05:27:19] <Joanna> The parents fight and break things?
[05:27:23] <juliaEnv> where I stay, there is only one room. I'm one person in that room, quiet, professional, working. They are 3 people, rude as f**k, behaving terribly to each other and causing nuisance also to me as I live next to them
[05:27:44] <juliaEnv> they don't break things, they just smash everything
[05:28:14] <Joanna> I had neighbors like that once but they were in big townhouse they were finally evicted
[05:28:15] <juliaEnv> anyway, you wouldn't understand that. In western culture, people are normal.
[05:28:34] <Joanna> They weren’t russians though
[05:28:43] <juliaEnv> In eastern european culture, people are dicators, angry, rude, ...
[05:28:53] <juliaEnv> they are likely Ukrainians
[05:29:28] <Joanna> I don’t have anything against the 3 people in one room part but I definitely don’t like screaming and smashing things..
[05:30:06] <Joanna> In Asia families sleep in same bed sometimes
[05:30:10] <juliaEnv> people educated in Eastern Europe typically hate other people and have a conflict with everybody. That's why they are so rude. They only manipulate/cheat/insult/etc.
[05:31:21] <juliaEnv> people educated in Western Europe (particularly in the UK and Sweden) are typically more polite and more civilized, and often like each other or at least try to be nice to each other
[05:31:21] <Joanna> Well a lot of problems could be avoided if people didn’t get involved in other countries business for sure.
[05:32:18] <Joanna> I think they band together by neighborhoods or used to.
[05:33:20] <Joanna> They have a rather harsh history thanks to the russian revolution and Stalin. Don’t know what it was like before that.
[05:33:22] <juliaEnv> well, I wish Sweden would have good, educated professionals to immigrate. You know, nobody needs more rude, communist criminals to make nuisance while hating everybody over here.
[05:34:05] <juliaEnv> in my view, these Ukrainians are something like muslims.
[05:34:08] <Joanna> This problem could have been avoided by nato not meddling
[05:34:17] <juliaEnv> yes
[05:34:43] <Joanna> Oh I heard british families want to take in Ukrainian refugees in their homes
[05:34:52] <juliaEnv> NATO initally didn't do anything. That was right. But now, emotionally blackmailed by the media, leaders make mistakes.
[05:35:07] <suss> Joanna for most of them?
[05:35:32] <Joanna> Also you can’t judge all Russians by one dysfunctional family that moves in next door
[05:35:36] <juliaEnv> those British families will either raise/educate those refugees on how to behave, or they will argue like hell and kick them out the door.
[05:35:52] <Joanna> suss: ?
[05:36:50] <suss> i mean is that the opinion for most of british ppl ?
[05:37:14] <Joanna> I can’t say I’m not british:)
[05:37:46] <Joanna> All this stuff in news media is really unverifiable rumors ..
[05:38:53] <suss> ya all fake news, or be it referred by any other fake news, what's the latest news about ukraine ? 
[05:39:30] <juliaEnv> I'd like to have the returned to Eastern Europe.
[05:39:33] <Joanna> There seems to be a recognizable pattern over the past few decades and that is destroying country after country and sending refugees all over the place as weapons. It’s really not the refugees fault their countries were destroyed. I blame the people who destroyed their countries.
[05:40:35] <Joanna> suss: latest news is they want to send lots of weapons and money and foolish people with a death wish :)
[05:40:57] <juliaEnv> Joanna if you had a million Ukrainians living in your area, you'd be doomed. Their behavior is exactly as bad as if you had Russians living there.
[05:41:29] <juliaEnv> it's fu**ing crazy to let millions of Russians/Ukrainians into Western Countries
[05:41:30] <Joanna> Well it’s not their fault and I refuse to vilify them
[05:41:56] <Joanna> It’s obvious part of a plan to destabilize Europe
[05:42:07] <juliaEnv> well, I'm not even sorry for Ukrainians any more when I observe first hand how they behave over here
[05:42:15] <Joanna> Any flood of refugees can do that
[05:42:27] <Joanna> One family?
[05:43:10] <juliaEnv> that is one family, however it's a specimen that behaves just like all the russians I've ever had a problem with when they lived anywhere near me
[05:43:44] <Joanna> Well the option of not getting involved has been ignored
[05:44:44] <Joanna>  It seems that Russians don’t want to kill them and just want to get back control
[05:44:48] <juliaEnv> I can't imagine anybody letting Ukrainians/Russians live with them in the West without being prepared to teach them how to behave.
[05:45:26] <Joanna> A lot of people in the west are dangerous and violent
[05:45:26] <juliaEnv> I wish Russians and Ukrainians would just kill each other :)
[05:45:48] <juliaEnv> for example one half of Russians who don't want a war could fight the other half
[05:46:18] <Joanna> Swedish were vikings who pillaged and plundered you know
[05:46:40] <juliaEnv> I always loved Vikings
[05:47:02] <Joanna> Sure they are great if you are on same side:)
[05:47:55] <Joanna> Nato could have told their puppet not to engage Russia if they wanted to
[05:48:19] <juliaEnv> well, Russians were monkeys and primitives, and today there are still monkeys and primitives. Nobody likes them. :)
[05:48:46] <juliaEnv> Ukrainians are the same, but nobody will believe that after two+ weeks of propaganda/spin from the media
[05:50:01] <suss> juliaEnv ua/ru refugees that vary from ones in mid-east to the extent of culture and religions as they are still europian
[05:50:02] <juliaEnv> and even if the crooked media suceed to migrate millions of Russians/Ukrainians to UK and Sweden, their hosting families will quickly find out they've been duped. It'll only take 1 or 2 days and these Swedish or British families will be completely fed up.
[05:50:15] <juliaEnv> *succeed
[05:50:40] <juliaEnv> s/UK/the UK/
[05:51:22] <juliaEnv> suss they are not EU
[05:51:49] <Joanna> It’s very cruel to call people who just had their country destroyed and were forced to leave monkeys
[05:51:49] <juliaEnv> suss so they are not truly European. There is a good reason for them to be outside of EU, such as not to migrate to EU countries.
[05:52:28] <juliaEnv> well, it's a pity that they come over here. It's very cruel to come over here and make nothing but nusiance and trouble.
[05:52:40] <Joanna> Just because one family is noisy
[05:52:44] <suss> given that historically
[05:52:51] <juliaEnv> they should at least behave well if they come to a Western country
[05:53:06] *** opaquebrokengoo is now known as duuude
[05:53:24] <Joanna> juliaEnv: blame the source of the trouble not the tools
[05:54:15] <Joanna> They should have not been dislodged from their country and sent abroad obviously
[05:55:04] <Joanna> Anyhow I go afk a bit.
[05:55:05] <juliaEnv> Joanna not only noisy, but also the guy is a communist dictator who keeps yielling and dictating to his wife who is there like a victim, and the kid keeps screaming all the time and running back and forth without his parents telling him anything, and he is very rude, smashes everything out of hate, disregards that there are other people, and if that guy got shot to the head it'd have been better for everybody than if this bastard 
[05:55:05] <juliaEnv> keeps angering his surroundings and also people who happen to live near him.
[05:55:44] <juliaEnv> and communists are always very rude like that with a terrible behavior, hating people around them, and only causing discomfort in their chase of power
[05:55:55] <juliaEnv> I hate all communists equally
[05:56:03] <juliaEnv> these people are communists
[05:56:10] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Joanna

[06:16:26] <Decker> some people need extra holes; sorta lets the pressure off their brain swell? :) sorry
[06:17:44] <Decker> so can someone tell me where these breakaway states came from?  I mean just one afternoon *bam* there's someone who let them in?
[06:18:06] <Decker> is this like dev politics? :) if not uhmm hi anyway
[06:20:04] <Joanna> Hi Decker from what I’ve heard the areas in Ukraine that want to secede are ethnically russian and the new government installed in 2014 was persecuting them and making it illegal to speak russian etc and then started shooting at them
[06:20:22] <Decker> right - so surely there was already rumors in the wind
[06:20:57] <Joanna> Why russia didn’t protect them for 8 years is pretty bad also they could have annexed them along with Crimea
[06:21:02] <Decker> maybe  shoulda read more RT; but ya know 90% of the time thye're just mimicing US propagagnda back anyway and didn't have a honest perpesctive either
[06:21:26] <Decker> So ya Crimea was another willing participant
[06:21:30] <Joanna> Yea really need to talk to people there to get the truth
[06:22:07] <Decker> so there was like 150+ mercenaries from other contries killed at Ukraine training facilities (getting oriented for missions to the war)
[06:22:26] <Joanna> Crimea is russians also and has the navy base so that wasn’t going to be given up. The Ukrainians did cut off the aqueduct to Crimea through
[06:22:30] <Decker> maybe if you're gonna be insurgents don't meet at your standing house?
[06:22:33] <Decker> standard
[06:23:08] <Joanna> I don’t know for sure but the Russians claim they only want to disable the military

[23:22:48] <Joanna> Do you all think that was a professional “influencer” yesterday hating on people in Ukraine? Seriously what is the probability of a Swedish female programmer coming to irc and also living next door to some Ukrainian refugees that make too much noise?
[23:24:21] <Joanna> I even asked someone who has worked with Russians who has confirmed that they weren’t monkeys.
[23:28:46] *** Joins: MiningMarsh (~MiningMar@user/miningmarsh)
[23:30:31] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: Putin is not a monster he is just doing what he believes is right. Even the nazis who committed atrocities are in a sense victims being manipulated. I bet there have been a lot of nazis who were misled about what they were signing up for and it seemed glamorous at the time then found themselves trapped with peer pressure and fear of being killed themselves if they didn’t obey orders.
[23:43:44] <JimBuntu> I also confirm that Russians are generally people, and not monkeys... however there may be a select handful of actual monkeys that have been granted special citizenship, living in a literal zoo.
[23:44:44] <JimBuntu> If it helps Joanna, I have worked both in person with and remotely with literal Russians, lol... as well as people originally from many other countries.
[23:53:27] <Joanna> I’ve known russian Armenians before as well as a genuine russian who was fluent in English
[23:59:05] <JimBuntu> For several years I worked with and then managed a man from Russia, in person.  He even brought me gifts back from the motherland when he went back every few years to visit family.  I don't even understand the idea that people could be so different simply due to what country they live in.  It's an idiotic thought.  They might act different due to cultures being different... but what specific culture someone
[23:59:07] <JimBuntu> has isn't defined by the country they currently reside in, lol.
