[10:04:08] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Having the integration is nice for some people. But it doesn't justify a global key binding.

[13:31:15] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Yeah, definitely not. In my opinion, it's a toggle *specifically* for GitHub-flavoured Markdown, and thus should live under `T` as `Tp` in the Markdown layer. :shrug:. Makes sense to me. If someone wants a global binding they can make one.
