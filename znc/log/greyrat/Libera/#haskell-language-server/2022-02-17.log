[16:58:43] <sooch_> If you’re talking about error messages in general? Yes it’s terrible. Unfortunately for what I’m doing I need the actual type which we can’t solve for (at least not that I’m aware of), nor is it accessible in the GHC API. This will be subsumed by proper programming when GHC extends their Structured Diagnostics in 9.4.

[21:37:02] <Guillaum[m]> mpickering: Where can I find documentation about the "hi" profiling mode and what is happening in `eventlog2html`? If I'm profile with `-hT`, I observe a (blue) component called `THUNK_2_0`. If I profile with `-hi`, this blue component have instead an address name and in the detailled list, the description, source location, type, ..., for this component are empty. There are many `THUNK_2_0` everywhere else, but with much
[21:37:02] <Guillaum[m]> much less integrated memory.
[21:37:02] <Guillaum[m]> Additionally, is there a way to list by thunk which are effectively retaining memory?
[21:39:34] <Guillaum[m]> (Right now, it is sometime frustrating, I pick the first thunk in the list by integration size, fix it and restart. Sometime it does not change anything (i.e. this thunk was just pointing to an object of similar size) and sometime it reduces memory usage dramatically (because it was actually retaining a lot of things).
[21:40:28] <Guillaum[m]> (My message can be read in a negative way, sorry. eventlog2html and hi profiling are AWESOME, that's so easy to track huge space leak with it, thank you very much for all your work!)

[22:59:29] <mpickering> Guillaum[m]: not sure I understand the issue
[22:59:37] <mpickering> do you mean in the detailed pane there is no source info?
[23:00:11] <mpickering> You have to think about your program to work out what is retaining memory
[23:00:19] <mpickering> you can use the filters to work it out better
[23:00:23] <mpickering> or use ghc-debug to look precisely

[23:02:32] <Guillaum[m]> mpickering: I mean that there is not always source info, see for example here; 
[23:02:41] <Guillaum[m]> I'll have a look at ghc-debug
