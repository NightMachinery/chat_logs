[09:34:36] <sdragon> I think an oscilliscope would be a better way to see the "wiggly air"
[09:38:13] <louipx> maybe someone with wiggly air matrix powers can see it
[09:38:44] <louipx> but i guess that kinda makes sense in some way
[09:38:57] <louipx> there could be a conceptual form of music that has no wiggly air
[09:39:02] <louipx> maybe music via light
[09:39:30] <louipx> translate wiggly air frequencies and dynamics into light of various wavelengths and intensities
[09:39:37] <sublim20> vibrating strings
[09:39:38] <louipx> will be 'music' to somebody
[09:39:44] <sublim20> model music as vibrating strings
[09:39:49] <sublim20> cause, that's all it is
[09:39:52] <louipx> wiggly water?
[09:39:59] <sublim20> wiggly ear drums
[09:40:04] <louipx> oh yes
[09:40:05] <louipx> heheh
[09:40:17] <louipx> wiggly nerve endings in the brain
[09:40:25] <sublim20> yeah
[09:40:31] <sublim20> whose input, is wiggly ear drums
[09:40:34] <sdragon> sublim20: if you're gonna slow anyone down like that, it should be Alvin and the Chipmunks

[09:40:45] <louipx> yea but you can remove the ear drums too
[09:41:12] <louipx> i wonder if the brain can implement a DAC on its own
[09:41:17] <efex_> the physic of sound are the musical arena
[09:41:21] <louipx> isn't that what the coclear implant does?
[09:41:30] <efex_> so that exists
[09:41:43] <louipx> i heard people sound like robots when a person first gets the implant
[09:41:50] <louipx> then they adapt and things sound normal
[09:42:08] <louipx> automatic-natural DAC
[09:45:58] <sublim20> sdragon, i have alvin and chipmunks
[09:46:10] <sublim20> they should be shot on site

[22:53:01] <Jan> it's a little um
[22:53:03] <Jan> different in tone
[22:53:13] <Jan> nobody seems to know what they're doing
[22:53:20] * R2robot hasn't seen it yet
[22:53:58] <R2robot> doesn't matter though. DS9 is best Star Trek
[22:53:59] <Jan> I won't spoil
[22:54:11] <sublim20> oooh
[22:54:15] <Jan> R2robot I know right, nobody likes ds9 but the guy I'd most like to work for is sisko
[22:54:41] <R2robot> Yeah, Sisko is awesome.
[22:55:10] <R2robot> Also, I miss Garak and his stories.

[22:57:40] <Jan> which is utterly brutal
[22:57:43] <R2robot> ouch!
[22:57:50] <Jan> professional reviewers gave it 86 per cent
[22:57:56] <Jan> which isn't that good even for them
