[01:25:27] <TieUpYourCamel> where do I contribute if I feel that documentation is incomplete or wrong?
[01:25:53] <Grinnz> depends where the documentation in question is maintained
[01:26:07] <Grinnz> (even the perl* docs aren't even all in core)
[01:26:53] <TieUpYourCamel> it would be on cpan/metacpan
[01:27:13] <TieUpYourCamel> actually, not only would it be, but it is
[01:27:30] <Grinnz> core docs are also on metacpan, so that's still the case
[01:27:38] <Grinnz> but generally, the issue tracker listed on metacpan for that distribution
[01:27:46] <TieUpYourCamel> ah ok
[01:28:04] <TieUpYourCamel> I can link to it here but I don't want to seem like I'm calling out (if that's a valid concern)

[01:29:18] <Grinnz> ah, this is tricky because it's not an indexed distribution
[01:29:21] <Grinnz> cause it has no perl modules
[01:29:26] <Grinnz> so RT didn't set up a queue for it
[01:30:43] <Grinnz> castaway is here, however

[01:33:09] <Grinnz> ill also note that tutorial is over a decade old
[01:33:37] <Grinnz> so i would assume the author does not plan to update it further
[01:33:49] <TieUpYourCamel> true
[01:35:28] <TieUpYourCamel> that's why I asked earlier if it was the best tutorial for beginners
[01:35:51] <Grinnz> could still be relevant, but did you try the regular manual?
[01:36:11] <TieUpYourCamel> I did not, where is that?

[01:42:10] *** Joins: nx_ (~nitronix@5.29.23.150)
[01:43:43] <TieUpYourCamel> ah yes, so far everything here is more in-line with what I eventually got to work.
[01:46:03] <TieUpYourCamel> which is this, if anyone is itchingly curious https://termbin.com/g6zz8
[01:47:18] <Grinnz> use lib "./lib"; is not necessary, you should arrange in your environment for it to use that lib dir either by running your script with perl -Ilib or (better) putting the absolute path in PERL5LIB so it doesn't get screwed up if someone chdirs
[01:47:34] <Grinnz> or use lib::relative to get an absolute path relative to that file
[01:48:03] <Grinnz> but that depends whether it's intended for a cpan module
[01:48:31] <TieUpYourCamel> it is not, but thanks for the pointer... I have blinders because I am the only person that ever uses my code.
[01:50:11] <Grinnz> for scripts for my own use i  use the lib::relative method

[02:34:21] <jaggz> I'm imagining some user-local cpan perl modules have compiled C stuff that doesn't match... but how do I find them?
[02:34:52] <Grinnz> anything you've installed with a cpan client has to be reinstalled, whether it's user local or not
[02:35:03] <Grinnz> if it is in a local::lib, it's probably in ~/perl5
[02:35:19] <jaggz> actually that one looks like it might be a system one?
[02:35:31] <Grinnz> ?
[02:35:37] <jaggz> Grinnz, yeah, it's there  (~/perl5)
[02:35:50] <Grinnz> Socket is dual life so you can update it from cpan and it will install wherever you normally isntall modules
[02:35:53] <jaggz> all the local ones have to be reinstalled?
[02:36:06] <Grinnz> so if that's what you did, you can move ~/perl5 to ~/perl5-old and use https://metacpan.org/pod/perl-migrate-modules to reinstall everything that was there
[02:36:07] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ perl-migrate-modules - Migrate installed CPAN modules from one Perl to another - metacpan.org ]
[02:36:27] <Grinnz> if you sudo cpanned anything then you have to do the same thing with your siteperl and that's more complex
[02:36:30] <jaggz> ./x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi/auto/Socket/Socket.so
[02:37:02] <jaggz> I probably mistakenly sudo cpan'ed things.. but I'll ignore that and pretend I didn't :)
[02:37:31] <jaggz> (I recall some software that I'd run in the past did sudo cpan stuff, and I was dumb and let it)
[02:37:36] <Grinnz> App::cpanminus is pretty much the only safe thing to sudo cpan
[02:37:42] <jaggz> but, yeah, I'll try to keep it clean this time.  Debian system :)

[02:40:45] <jaggz> how do I install perl-migrate-modules?
[02:40:55] <Grinnz> in your new perl, with cpanm
[02:41:01] <Grinnz> App::MigrateModules
[02:41:10] <jaggz> oh, thanks
[02:41:34] <jaggz> (was just trying cpanm perl-migrate-modules.. which didn't seem like proper module syntax to me :) .. )

[02:42:59] <jaggz> thanks Grinnz  :) :)
[02:43:31] <jaggz> lots of modules. tempted to only install as needed, but that's more frustrating than it's worth I think

[02:46:52] <jaggz> yeah.. just nice, sometimes, to clean stuff up -- from experimental installations of deps
[02:47:17] <jaggz> I wonder if there's a tool to look for non-dependency installs (skim through looking for things I don't think I manually installed myself)
[02:47:30] <jaggz> anyway, no biggie
[02:47:37] <Grinnz> there's no distinction like that existing once you've installed them
[02:47:58] <jaggz> that would be a good capability to have
[02:48:09] <Grinnz> that really needs an rpmdb to work, even carton doesn't do that
[02:48:36] <Grinnz> (though with carton you always start from a cpanfile which you could use for that)
[02:48:56] <jaggz> would be good if cpanm just kept track
[02:49:06] <Grinnz> yes, that's called an rpmdb :P

[02:51:25] <Grinnz> i do want to write something that does the first half of perl-migrate-modules and then writes out a cpanfile
[02:51:53] <Grinnz> could probably just be an option for perl-migrate-modules tbh
[02:52:30] <Grinnz> i also want to fix ExtUtils::Installed so it works properly for a few weird dists
[02:53:00] <Grinnz> App::cpanoutdated always fails to get picked up by perl-migrate-modules because of its weird dist name for instance
[02:53:12] <jaggz> it would be good for it to be a generalized system and api 
[02:53:40] <jaggz> the perl dependency manager
[02:54:04] <Grinnz> it kind of is, it's just all in Menlo::CLI::Compat
[02:54:11] <jaggz> whereby the caller can also specify examination of system as well as cpanm-based installations
[02:54:23] <Grinnz> which is basically just all the functions that used to be in App::cpanminus
[02:55:06] <Grinnz> ah well, thats not really a specific thing
[02:55:08] <jaggz> (in my actual use I rarely need it.. but that means I just build up perl modules with cpanm and have no means to clean stuff up)
[02:55:28] <Grinnz> ExtUtils::Installed searches for packlists, which are the only reliable way to find things that were installed by a cpan client
[02:56:17] <Grinnz> CPAN.pm keeps its own db, i think, but that doesn't help when you use cpanm
[02:56:53] <Grinnz> also mostly it still works if you delete ~/.cpan so i'm not sure how much it relies on it

[17:20:32] <Grinnz> jadesoturi: decode_json decodes a byte string, not a filename. you have to read the bytes from the file first
[17:20:43] <Grinnz> you can do this with File::Slurper::read_binary or Path::Tiny slurp_raw
[17:20:56] <Grinnz> or Mojo::File::slurp
[17:21:12] <jadesoturi> ohh ok i though i could just pass it the json file and it would figure it out..:P 
[17:21:30] <Grinnz> https://metacpan.org/pod/File::JSON::Slurper wraps this into a single function

[17:22:07] <jadesoturi> thanks i will check it out :) 
[17:22:10] <Grinnz> (but it's literally just File::Slurper::read_binary then decode_json)
[17:23:48] <jadesoturi> you mean read_json ? 
[17:24:07] <Grinnz> yes, if you look at the source read_json is just calling those two functions
[17:24:59] *** tnez_ is now known as tnez
[17:29:48] <jadesoturi> hmm ok. is there a way to do this without the fFile::JSON::Slurper ? it needs to be installed extra, but the server running the code in the end is running a minimal bundeled perl 5.26.2 and i cant install any other modules there :/

[17:30:37] <Botje> perlbot: slurp
[17:30:38] <perlbot> Botje: slurping is reading the whole file into memory in one go. Use Path::Tiny or File::Slurper or something like my $file_contents = do { local $/; readline($fh) };. Also see: https://perl-begin.org/topics/files-and-directories/#string_slurp_utf8 . Avoid File-Slurp and IO-All.
[17:31:03] <Grinnz> jadesoturi: File::Slurper, Path::Tiny, or Mojo::File, like i said

[17:32:39] <jadesoturi> yeah. looking at the old scripts here it seems thats what they were doing earlier.. 
[17:32:51] * genio ponders putting a huge disclaimer at the top of File::Slurp. 
[17:32:57] <Grinnz> note: i wrote every part of that a specific way, if you do it slightly differently it won't work correctly
[17:33:11] <genio> However, I've had a good run of not pissing off the original author and maybe shouldn't start now.
[17:33:52] <Grinnz> (which is why these modules exist which don't let you do it incorrectly)
[17:35:01] <_73> genio: is there a problem outside the ones expressed under the `WARNING - PENDING DOOM` header in the docs?
[17:35:37] <Grinnz> _73: aside from that the problem is just that the interface is terrible to use

[17:47:15] <ilmari> krismatrix: that's a list on the right-hand side, which gets assigned to the array
