[15:39:45] <lizmat> that's a real existential question  :-)

[20:02:04] <whatnext> at least when it comes to doing something undesirable
[20:02:57] <whatnext> how about this one: "longjmp causes uninitialized stack frame" - when using Inline::Perl5 (? I'm guessing)
[20:05:02] <guifa__> but I'll just be updating the prettifier as I end up hitting more stuff, bu for my formatters I think basic if/then, method and infix calls, and string concats will be the bulk of what I use
[20:05:52] <whatnext> I added a comment to my gist here: https://gist.github.com/whatnext/a33b7bff81c35ed4766add3a3daa6377
[20:06:33] <whatnext> i guess it's not looking like a memory leak, but something else
[20:09:01] <whatnext> `can't locate object method "DESTROY" via package "Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::Workbook"` seems to be the only thing in English :D  - we are using this module from Perl 5 using `Inline::Perl5`. Suggestions anyone? :)
[20:09:40] <lizmat> you might want to create an Inline::Perl5 issue

[21:14:47] <El_Che> go version go1.17.3 linux/amd64
[21:15:04] <El_Che> I don't think google is giving up on trademarks and copyrights
[21:15:05] <gfldex> If you don't use a R it can become void in many countries.
[21:15:34] <El_Che> so google just lost their trademark after I ran the command?
[21:16:10] <gfldex> No, they use their trademark in so many places, that they don't have to for go.
[21:16:48] <El_Che> so, put the trademark somewhere in a dark corner on the site and problem solved
[21:19:57] <tonyo> .tell tbrowder i can work on a tut for ya on sunday night 
[21:19:58] <tellable6> tonyo, I'll pass your message to tbrowder
[21:27:08] <whatnext> I am sure you all will be excited to learn I may have found a solution
[21:27:58] <whatnext> that is for my particular case, and meaning it now seems to work but without knowing exactly why
[21:29:02] <whatnext> I explicitly set the container for the `Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::Workbook` object to Nil after the extraction
[21:29:04] <gfldex> Magic! \o/
[21:29:39] <whatnext> and apparently I need to use `Thread.start`. If I use `start` I still get an error
[21:29:49] <whatnext> pretty weird - but whatever :D
[21:32:11] <japhb> El_Che: Trademarks must be actively defended in order to remain valid.  Hiding that you have one seems unlikely to count.  Also, both the distinctive font (Unicode block actually, but it *looks* like a different font) and the TM/R were needed when we got the EU trademark registration.
[21:32:42] <El_Che> so, ruby and go lost their trademark?
[21:33:08] <gfldex> did they ever have one?
[21:33:10] <japhb> El_Che: They're probably just protecting them in a different place, that's all.  Like on their main website.
[21:33:25] <El_Che> japhb: yes, that's my point
[21:33:39] <El_Che> it looks more applicable there than in the cli
[21:33:55] <japhb> El_Che: And I'm saying the reason that we did that is because the international trademark lawyers told us to.
[21:34:05] <japhb> We didn't just do it because we felt like it.
[21:34:13] <El_Che> yes, I get that
[21:34:27] <El_Che> I wonder why other more popular languages don't do it
[21:34:43] <El_Che> there is a lot more money to rip off stealing the go or ruby trademark
[21:34:58] <ugexe> to me it feels like a lawyer said that because its easiest to assume that to be correct, instead of verifying something else would work
[21:35:21] <japhb> Possible, sure.
[21:35:47] <japhb> Interestingly `gcc --version` decides to be explicit about copyright and warranty, rather than trademark
[21:37:30] <japhb> TIL that `python -v` is rather different than `python --version`
[21:38:02] <El_Che> perl -v does have a copyright notice and no trademark
