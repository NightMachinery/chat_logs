[00:24:59] <nativetexan> cheers
[00:25:03] <Inline> cause i think most isos i have are already UEFI enabled and hence don't use the mbr (it's a gpt partitioning scheme anyway what i have)
[00:25:11] *** Joins: ttree (~ttree0@c-73-239-62-159.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[00:25:30] <Inline> or the mbr in that case is moved onto the efi partition
[00:25:52] <Inline> and the legacy bios boot one is not even touched upon
[00:26:32] <Inline> i suppose that's why i see the first part and have to press enter again
[00:26:32] <nativetexan> legacy, whatchya hangin' onto then?
[00:26:57] <Inline> well when i installed grub and it asked my which disk to use i used the correct disk
[00:27:21] <Inline> in that case it should use the first 512 bytes or so of the disk
[00:27:34] <Inline> but that would be on the legacy bios boot partition
[00:27:46] <Inline> so it instead writes it behind that i think
[00:27:57] <Inline> into the EFI system partition
[00:28:08] <nativetexan> 512 bytes?
[00:28:09] <macrobat> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACZA9dGvV4

[00:29:45] <Inline> that's black magic tech
[00:29:47] <Inline> lol
[00:30:09] <nativetexan> just giving you a hard time, i mean 512bytes is just old
[00:30:46] <nativetexan> my little sister's pc has 16GB 
[00:30:52] <Inline> naa all the recommendation on the net say leave 1G for legacy bios boot then make an EFI system partition
[00:31:06] <Inline> i used to make that 1G too but saw last time some OSes use more than that
[00:31:36] <Inline> so i make that 2G instead
[00:31:50] <nativetexan> yeah no more is better
[00:31:58] <Inline> but i suppose that's still not correct, cause usually EFI is only the first 2Gb of the disk
[00:32:24] <Inline> so when you make the legacy bios boot one 1G then you are left with 1G
[00:32:40] <morlog> 256 to 512 mbs
[00:32:49] <morlog> for the efi partition
[00:32:54] <Inline> hmmm
