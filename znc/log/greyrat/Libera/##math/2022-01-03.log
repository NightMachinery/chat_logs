[01:50:46] <dila> yes, i am not using the matrix product
[01:50:57] <int-e> "a product of matrices"
[01:50:59] <dila> i do not know what the product operation is. that is what i am asking for i suppose
[01:51:07] <dila> how to construct it
[01:51:08] <int-e> then I don't know what you mean by that
[01:51:39] <int-e> dila: I don't get it; it takes you outside of the domain of "linear" polynomials you're considering
[01:51:47] <dila> int-e: there are more polynomials than matrices. for example x^3 when p=2 cannot be represented as a matrix, even though i can write it as f(x)f(x^2)
[01:51:55] <int-e> so it /can't/ work on the matrix representation that is limited to those polynomials
[01:52:22] <dila> int-e: can't i invent some kind of extension of the matrices that lets it work
[01:53:38] <int-e> sure. but it'll be much larger because you need to enough information to cover p^n coefficients in F_(p^n) rather than just n.
[01:54:05] <dila> ok
[01:55:16] <dila> i noticed that each matrix for the terms of p(x) = ax + bx^p + cx^(p^2) + ... allows for p^(n^2) possible matrices, but there are only p^n accessible through the map
[01:55:28] <dila> so there is some redundancy that might allow more polynomials to be represented
[01:56:03] <dila> f(ax) + f(bx^p) + ..., is a sum of matrices
[01:56:11] <int-e> dila: nope, it's p^(n^2) becauce a,b, etc are in F_(p^n)
[01:56:59] <int-e> so the counts match; you have a bijection
[01:57:40] <dila> yes, so each coefficient of each term in the polynomial can be one of p^n possible values, but if you put one term through the map you get a p^(n^2) matrix. that is p^n times more than necessary.
[01:57:59] <int-e> ?
[01:58:14] <dila> take this term for instance, f(bx^p)
[01:58:34] <int-e> you have n^2 entries from F_p in the matrix, that's p^(n^2) possible matrices
[01:58:58] <int-e> you have n coefficients from F_(p^n) in the polynomial, that's (p^n)^n = p^(n^2) possible polynomials
[01:59:02] <dila> b \in F_(p^n), but f(bx^p) \in F_p^(n*n)
[01:59:08] <int-e> it's the same effing number
[01:59:35] <dila> int-e: if you put each term separately through the map, you get a sum of matrices?
[01:59:51] <int-e> "each term separately"
[02:00:04] <dila> 2:26 < dila> f(ax) + f(bx^p) + ..., is a sum of matrices
[02:00:12] <int-e> That'll restrict the matrices you can get, obviously.
[02:00:12] <dila> [f(ax), f(bx^p), ...
[02:00:13] <dila> as a vector
[02:00:47] <dila> ok. so its a long shot, but i think that that extra "space" in each matrix might allow more polynomials to be represented.
[02:00:50] <dila> i have no idea how though
[02:01:40] <int-e> You already know what that space does... it combines ax, bx^p, etc. back into ax + bx^p + etc.
[02:02:27] <dila> you are saying that in the addition all but one element will be non-zero?
[02:02:32] <dila> by element i mean "matrix slot"
[02:02:40] <dila> that is possible
[02:03:15] <int-e> splitting P into P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + ... adds ambiguity, not more information to the resulting map.
[02:03:16] *** nullcone_ is now known as nullcone
[02:03:56] <dila> doesn't it make sense to think of x and f(x) as somehow special elements in each set?
[02:04:44] *** halberd is now known as causative
[02:04:48] <dila> maybe you're right, and theres nothing more to it. but it's possible to multiply those vectors of matrices together, but then its impossible to "fold" the products
[02:05:31] <dila> (f(x) + f(x^2))f(x) = f(x)f(x) + f(x^2)f(x)
[02:05:57] <dila> the point is, i can write x^3 as a matrix symbolically, but i can't "fold" it
[02:07:10] <dila> in practice you might end up doing a lot of computation and get back to something that does have a matrix representation
[02:08:02] <dila> i can use a old school cayley table to look up the products x*x = x^2 :(

[02:18:59] <int-e> You can find a homomorphism from your polynomial ring (over F_(p^n), modulo x^p^n - x) to a ring of matrices over F_p using companion matrices (one to deal with working modulo x^p-x, and another one for working modulo an n-th degree irreducible polynomial from F_{p^n} = F_p[y]/(q(y))). The matrices will be huge though, p^(n+1)xp^(n+1).
[02:19:31] <int-e> And none of this will help with factoring, I think.

[02:36:45] <int-e> is that still the odd function problem? AIUI it's really about finding odd functions that make the integral easy... then use linear combinations of those. or maybe have a parametric function and determine the parameter.

[02:37:35] <Guest145> Then is the following correct? Since f''' is even, and a^2-x^2 is even, the product is even, and if G is the antiderivative of the integrand, and asumming G(0) = 0, then G is odd and hence a^3= G(a)-G(-a) = 2*G(a)
[02:37:38] <int-e> or is that "for all a"... now I'm confused

[06:38:49] <mycroftiv> i still dont know if http://wiki.9gridchan.org/incoming/mycro/agdahtml/FilterSheaves.html is an accurate formalization of the papers it references, it makes sense to me but it would probably make sense to me even if it was totally wrong

[06:43:07] <mycroftiv> i know this for certain because earlier versions of that file had things that were totally wrong, that i figured out from re-reading the papers and testing the code in various ways, but i expect there are still issues

[06:50:30] <mycroftiv> apart from formalization, if anyone studies ultraproducts in model theory, large cardinal embeddings in set theory, or the sheaf-topos version of forcing im generally interested in these things and their use of filters

[06:59:38] <mycroftiv> the General Ultrafilter Topics bureau is also interested in their use in nonstandard analysis and the social choice/voting theorems as well, or proofs of logical completeness or topological convergence. or if you thought you saw an ultrafilter once but couldnt get a picture.
[06:59:55] <frelleck> who are you talking to?

[07:03:12] <mycroftiv> its definitely somewhat of a specialized obsession, i have learned this for sure
[07:03:55] <frelleck> anyhow, feel free to carry on, I didn't mean to interrupt
[07:04:12] <mycroftiv> actually talking to people is a goal not a problem
[07:04:36] <frelleck> are you in a PhD program or something?
[07:04:46] <mycroftiv> no, if i was i would know someone who knew about these things
[07:04:46] <frelleck> you might have better luck with grad students
[07:04:57] <frelleck> or crash math conferences
[07:05:04] <mycroftiv> ive spent years of my life on studying large cardinals and have never spoken to a single human being who studies them
[07:05:10] <frelleck> that's crazy
[07:05:14] <mycroftiv> its gonna be crazy when i finally meet a real life set theorist
[07:05:25] <mycroftiv> im almost 50 years old and ive spent 5+ years on this topic
[07:05:39] <frelleck> how far did you get in your math education
[07:05:42] <mycroftiv> i have 100,000+ lines of agda code devoted to figuring out how measurable cardinals and ultrafilters work
[07:06:14] <frelleck> assuming you're not a crackpot, you can try just corresponding to people in the field
[07:06:16] <mycroftiv> i went to college as a music theory major, i only did standard high school/college basic math, but ive always had a hobby interest and got serious in self study a few years ago

I obtained this with seeing that lim sup{ |f_n(x) - f(x)|: x in (1,inf)} as n->inf is lim sup{ 1 / (x^n)
[15:01:05] <anovick> : x in (1,inf)} as n->inf which equals 1, and because this is not zero then there is no uniform convergence.

[15:07:25] <isekaijin> f_n converges pointwise to f, but you can't find a single “rate of convergence” (i.e., a function from epsilon to delta) that works for all “x”.

[15:12:32] <anovick> isekaijin: yes that seems right to me. because lim sup {| f_n(x) - f(x) | : x in [1+a, inf)} as n->inf would be lim 1/(1+a)^n as n->inf which would be 0 and therefore there is uniform convergence
[15:14:29] <anovick> isekaijin: so yes there is a fine line that separates whether there is uniform convergence or not in this case with domain (1,inf) and any [1+a,inf)

[15:26:29] <cadmio> I've to prove this
[15:26:34] <cadmio> Let G be a group, and let N be a normal subgroup of G. Then G is solvable if and only if N and G/N are solvable.
[15:28:30] <cadmio> I'm not sure about the sequence realizing solvability for G/N. Is it {e} = eN ?
[15:33:20] <isekaijin> cadmio: The identity element of G/N is eN, yes. (Where e is the identity element of G.)
[15:33:41] <isekaijin> Have you already studied the Jordan-Hölder theorem?
[15:38:31] <cadmio> isekaijin: because I find N/N instead and I'm confused
[15:38:38] <cadmio> no, not yet studied that
[15:39:13] <isekaijin> N/N is the same thing as {eN}.
[15:39:51] <isekaijin> We have a subnormal series for G/N, say, G/N = H0 > H1 > ... > Hr = N/N.
[15:40:13] <riv> hello
[15:40:16] <cadmio> yes and one for N: N = N0 ⊃ N1 ⊃ Ni ⊃ ⋅⋅⋅ ⊃ N_m = {e}
[15:40:29] <isekaijin> The one for N doesn't concern us for the time being.
[15:40:31] <isekaijin> By the correspondence theorem, each Hi is of the form Hi = Gi/N, where G > Gi > N.
[15:40:41] <riv> >  group G is called solvable if it has a subnormal series whose factor groups (quotient groups) are all abelian
[15:41:16] <isekaijin> By the correspondence theorem again, H{i+1} is a normal subgroup of Hi if and only if G{i+1} is a normal subgroup of Gi.
[15:41:53] <isekaijin> Since our series for G/N is subnormal, then G = G0 > ... > Gr = N is a subnormal series.

[18:30:09] <cadmio> I think I've to use Sylow's theory
[18:30:14] <Franciman> it's 7 * 13
[18:30:18] <Z-module> you had a p < q thing, cadmio
[18:30:19] <Franciman> it's the product of two prime numbers, cadmio
[18:30:28] <Franciman> you did this exercise as Z-module says
[18:30:32] <Franciman> i distinctly remember it
[18:30:39] <Franciman> you know the structure of a p*q group!
[18:30:41] <Franciman> yes you do!
[18:31:39] <Franciman> with p, q coprime
[18:32:06] <Franciman> ok sylow can also work i guess
[18:32:07] <dila> Sylow is for prime power orders, isn't it?
[18:32:13] <Z-module> (revising my earlier example, though cadmio never saw it):  cadmio, by the way, even for composition series there can be more than one of those. In G = C_2 x C_2, both   G > C_2 x {e} > {e} x {e}  and   G > {e} x C_2 > {e} x {e}  are composition series.
[18:32:42] <dila> iirc it's a stronger form of Lagrange's theorem which is about the existence of subgroups of a given order
[18:32:51] <Franciman> dila: there is a theorem saying that if p is prime, and p^n is the greatest power of p which is a divisor of |G| (the order of the group)
[18:32:57] <Z-module> dila, yes, but it's more than that
[18:32:59] <Franciman> then there is a p-Sylow subgroup of G
[18:33:09] <Franciman> of order p^n
[18:33:45] <Franciman> is it also a normal subgroup of G?
[18:34:13] <Z-module> sometimes, Franciman, and you can conclude that sometimes based on the other parts of the theorem
[18:34:31] <Franciman> yup, i was asking the audience

[18:42:09] <cadmio> 91 = 13 ⋅ 7, the number of Sylow 7-subgroup must be a divisor of 13, that is either 13 or 1. Since it must also be conguent to 1 modulo 7, we conclude there is only a Sylow 7-subgroup.

[21:00:27] <isekaijin> So, something like a semigroupoid?
[21:00:32] <jodmos> isekaijin add 0 to the partially defined semi-group when not defined, and you get a bona fide semi-group.
[21:01:12] <jodmos> so you can make homomorphisms of partially defined semigroups that you can canonically extend into homomorphisms of semi-groups by adding 0.

[21:13:51] <isekaijin> In ring-land, or at least commutative ring-land, we also have a similar kind of duality: a prime ideal is additively closed, its complement is multiplicatively closed.

[21:44:42] <isekaijin> No, wait.
[21:44:53] <jodmos> isekaijin the order of the ordering makes it compatible with topos theory, that's why...
[21:45:08] <isekaijin> You said the down set generated by the only relation on the empty set. So this relation and everything under it.

[21:47:30] <isekaijin> Unless I'm misunderstanding the definition of relation composition.
[21:47:33] <jodmos> yep
[21:47:54] <isekaijin> So, does your down set contain anything besides empty relations?
[21:48:04] <jodmos> not that I know of. no.
[21:48:15] <jodmos> its kind of the point...
[21:48:17] <mycroftiv> jodmos: im trying to catch up a bit with your ideas, how do they relate to standard definition of what characterizes topos, either grothendieck or elementary?
[21:48:29] <isekaijin> So how is this collection of empty relations going to help us recover anything?
[21:49:08] <jodmos> x < z iff exists i such that x = i.z defines the subobject lattice in topos theory when x and z are monomorphisms.
[21:51:26] <jodmos> isekaijin it precisely gives us the data of emptyness, hence disjointness (when empty relational links) and yields the data allowing us to recover the empty relational links of a given relation and hence the non-empty relational links. ipso facto its graph. Without that set, this cannot be done. if the inconsistency down-set is empty, and does not
[21:51:26] <jodmos> contain 1(0), then all relations are full...
[21:52:05] <mycroftiv> ok wait - i think maybe i have a grasp
[21:52:08] <jodmos> if the the graph of 1(0) is not declared empty, then no emptyness is possible, and all relations are full.
[21:52:30] <jodmos> isekaijin which is why 1(0) must be in that down-set.
[21:52:35] <mycroftiv> does this relate to the fact that the empty set is a concrete set, but the empty type in type theory has no terms, and so the initial object in a categorical sense is kind of all screwy between the two?
[21:52:54] <isekaijin> jodmos: Okay, so what you want to do is simply recover the class of empty relations?
[21:52:55] <jodmos> mycroftiv likely. dunno details.
[21:53:05] <jodmos> isekaijin and you can do more.
[21:53:09] <jodmos> isekaijin example.
[21:53:30] <jodmos> P(X) collection of all sub-collections of X has a minimum.
[21:53:46] <jodmos> the empty collection.
[21:53:51] <mycroftiv> let me express this - in set theory the initial object empty set is what sets are built from. in type theory the bottom type is a type with no terms and things are not 'built from' it at all really. they are both initial object in their categories
[21:54:21] <jodmos> If you do not declare that collection to be empty, then any two collection intersect, because the empty collection is contained in both of them.
[21:54:44] <jodmos> If you remove the empty collection, you get P*(X) the collection of all non-empty sub-collections of X.
[21:54:45] <isekaijin> What does “intersection” even mean in a purely categorical setting anyway?
[21:55:42] <mycroftiv> i do not fully understand everything jodmos is saying but i think it may be very related to a fundamental frustration i have trying to agda formalize mathematical definitions between set theory and type theory and how category theory talks about things
[21:56:00] <jodmos> and you can reconstruct the sub-collections of X from this data. "Geometrisation" procedure I hinted at. But you must remove the empty collection from the ordering of P(X) for that to hold. Geometrisation of P(X) is a singleton. Geometrisation of P*(X) is P*(X). P*(X) is geometric. P(X) is not geometric.
[21:56:39] <jodmos> isekaijin multiplication = intersection...
[21:56:50] <jodmos> isekaijin that's the Boolean Ideology.
[21:57:47] <jodmos> George Boole strikes back...
[21:57:56] <isekaijin> When you said “take Rel, the category of binary relations”, I kinda assumed that we were going to use the category-theoretic structure alone.
[21:58:22] <jodmos> isekaijin we did ! Plus the down-collection of "inconsistency".

[22:01:20] <isekaijin> I'm sorry. I have no intuition for this. Do you have any reference on order theory that I could use to get up to date?
[22:01:36] <jodmos> nope. only my personal notes.

[22:12:14] <Stefan26> I feel confused about the infinity-concept. A sequence of real numbers s=(a_n) can either be infinite or finite, and sequences can have different properties like the property "all elements in the sequence are larger than 2"... for that property clearly there are both sequences of finite and infinite length that have that property, but what's an example of a property where no infinite sequence
[22:12:14] <Stefan26> of real numbers exist with that property, but *arbitrary long* sequences with that property exist?
[22:12:32] <jodmos> isekaijin do you have master's ?
[22:12:44] <isekaijin> Nah, I'm currently doing my master's.

[22:14:19] <jodmos> i was going to propose that.
[22:18:41] <Stefan26> hmm i think my question was stupid, since one can have the property "is not infinite", but i think i was looking for non-trivial examples maybe like "boundeded above by *some* n in Z, strictly increasing, and elements are in Z" is such a property

[22:24:34] <mycroftiv> trying to differentiate 'arbitrarily large but finite' from 'infinite' is really interesting in fact constructively

[23:01:45] <am1985> Without invoking anything supernatural and preferably with as little complex analysis as possible can someone help me out?
[23:02:18] <riv> why do you want to reduce complex analysis
[23:02:21] <riv> when it literally has i in it
[23:02:47] <riv> btw, is it the case that exp(-(x+c)^2) for any constant c in C is sqrt(pi)?
[23:02:52] <riv> or is i special?
[23:03:16] <am1985> Only because I don't know any and if there's an explanation that could help me understand it that would help
[23:03:41] <riv> ok, it's likely that complex analysis will help
[23:03:52] <am1985> Seems like any other constant gives the same thing. For the reals just a change of variables
[23:05:06] <am1985> Would you use Cauchy's integral theorem to prove it?

[23:08:43] <greenbagels> am1985: in general, using complex analysis can make a lot of these integrals, even with real-valued integrands, easier to calculate

[23:17:25] <greenbagels> yeah; take some set of polynomials with non-real roots
[23:17:45] <greenbagels> like (x^2+k) for any positive number k
[23:18:15] <Z-module> hmm:  exp(-(x + i)^2) = exp(-x^2 + 1 - 2xi) = exp(1 - x^2) exp(-2xi)    and as x traverses R, that second factor just spins around the unit circle.  But we need more than this.
[23:18:27] <greenbagels> take the reciprocal of some product of these, like 1/(x^2+1)(x^2+2)(x^2+3)
[23:19:23] <greenbagels> if you want to integrate this along the entire real line, it boils down to just 2pi times the sum of the residues of this fraction
[23:20:28] <am1985> Interesting... not sure what a residue is but is that easier than just computing partial fractions and using arctans?
[23:20:35] <greenbagels> yeah
[23:22:19] <dude12312414> i've always found the complex analytic techniques to calculate real-valued integrals a bit suspicious
[23:22:31] <riv> really dude12312414 ?
[23:23:03] <dude12312414> in the sense that it seems to me like there is some underlying concept that is being masked by the complex analysis
[23:23:43] <dude12312414> like, a different way of thinking about it, like some intuitive geometric idea or something
[23:24:30] <riv> i see
[23:24:40] <greenbagels> would there be any hope of a geometric idea for these real integrals in the general case?
[23:24:41] <dude12312414> obviously the method works, i just think it's looking at the problem from a weird angle (despite being already more elegant that solving the integral by more elementary means)
[23:25:33] <riv> I get your point
[23:25:42] <riv> the tricks used to evaluate integrals can be quite difficult too
[23:25:50] <riv> it's not always a mechanical application of residue
