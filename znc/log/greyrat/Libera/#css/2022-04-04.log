[00:40:14] <DPA> I don't think the inspector tools are suitable for this. Sure, I can see there which rule wins out for any given element, but I'd prefer to just have a list of selector -> exact specificity. Because I want to get an overview so I can check all cases.

[15:23:45] <andai> Hi, is there any way to simultaneously (a) tell the browser what size an image will be so the page doesn't jump around while it's loading, and (b) automatically resize it (eg width: 50%)? Adding width/height attribs fixed the reflow problem, but then the image was warped (it was taking 50% from CSS and the height from the attrib. So I added height:
[15:23:46] <andai> auto which fixed the warp but now it's back to how it was originally (has no height until it loads...)
