[00:08:06] <djm> A v60 is single mug, and even easier cleanup than an aeropress; doesn't do the timer/automatic part though

[00:54:27] <bpalmer> I typically open a separate emacs process per project, and I think it's a simple and straightforward approach.
[00:54:45] <hiroshi[m]> bpalmer: how you open files from different git repositories ?

[00:56:01] <bpalmer> I mean, I can and do C-x C-f to arbitrary paths, but it's usually pretty clear what "project" most of the files I've opened are related to.
[00:56:44] <bpalmer> hiroshi[m]: er, right, but I don't follow. I can check out code if I want (using any version control system, not just git) into project1, project2, etc; when I want to work on project1, I open an emacs inside its directory
[00:57:34] <bpalmer> hiroshi[m]: my editing code has nothing to do with the version control system; I'm just changing files on disk. And I probably don't need to open files under project2, when I'm busy working on project1.
[00:57:34] <hiroshi[m]> bpalmer: this is quite handy.
[00:57:34] <hiroshi[m]> I  worked with more than 20 git repositories per day . projectile help me to open files in a git repo really fast without a manual tag or bookmark
[00:57:50] <kenran> Thinking about it, I really only use two things: projectile-find-file (could easily be replaced), and projectile-switch-project -> which in turn is used to either 1) find a file 2) show magit-status.

[15:04:18] <nick45> Hello all. Lately I've been forced to read and edit markdown documents of technical specifications. They are pretty simple docs, mainly consisting of headlines and verbatim code. My current workflow sucks because I read them on the brower (to have nice formatting) and then edit them on emacs. Is there a better workflow I can adopt for such basic markdown documents only inside emacs? 
[15:04:36] <euouae> djm, perhaps that's why that pops up. You can have multiple keys associated to an email address (identities)
[15:04:46] <euouae> djm, so find out what that default key is 
[15:06:15] *** Joins: xa_ (~NesLs@176.54.248.155)
[15:06:19] <djm> euouae: gpg --list-keys only lists one key
[15:06:24] <euouae> djm, it must be related to org-mode is what I'm saying
[15:07:03] <djm> Strange - previously I could save a .authinfo.gpg fine, but now I get an error about an inappropriate ioctl
[15:07:33] <pjb> nick45: you can bind a command to reload in the browser.
[15:07:42] <djm> Probably macos/homebrew being stupid, I guess (at least that part of it)
[15:07:56] <pjb> nick45: a first step could be: M-x compile RET markdown_py-3.9  -o html -f /tmp/a.html /tmp/a.md && open /tmp/a.html RET  and then M-x recompile RET
[15:08:16] <pjb> nick45: but you can wrap that in an emacs lisp command, eg bound to C-c C-c
[15:08:34] <MysteriousSilver> nick45: open the html in eww?

[15:12:24] <nick45> I do have markdown mode, but I don't see the headline sizes

[22:57:22] <technomancy> glumanda: elisp is a programming language, and functional programming is an activity.
[22:57:39] <rcy> there's no such thing as a functional programming language
[22:57:40] <technomancy> you can do functional programming in elisp but it's more awkward than it would be in certain other languages.
[22:57:44] <rcy> i read that on the internet somewhere
[22:57:47] <technomancy> hehe
[22:58:39] <Pickchea> You can do functional programming with Emacs Lisp but that's because its a symbolic programming language so you get the functional part somewhat for free :-)
[22:59:07] <technomancy> FP is possible to do in elisp but it's much more natural to do in a lisp-1
[22:59:35] *** Joins: ugly (~ugly@2804:431:d77e:3a94:245f:a975:3ab9:6447)
[22:59:59] <Pickchea> Haskell for example is known for being a functional programming language and it's really good at being one that's also statically typed. But it's not a symbolic one (without extensions).
[23:00:15] <technomancy> Bayes: what language are you working with that you're having trouble with?
[23:00:29] <rcy> technomancy: nice post btw, that is helpful to parse out what people are talking about with FP and langs
[23:00:38] <rcy> or ought to be talking about
[23:01:07] <technomancy> rcy: thanks. it's been on my mind for a while; I think a lot of these discussions are framed in ways that obscure what's really going on
[23:01:32] <technomancy> "there is no such thing as a fast programming language" being another
[23:02:16] <rcy> I'm back to writing ruby most days but still think in terms of functional programming, mostly and sorta kinda do FP there where I can... it is not about the language exactly
[23:02:52] <technomancy> rcy: yeah, I found after working in Clojure for years I could write much better Lua that avoided most of the problems of imperative coding.
[23:03:02] <acdw> i first really learned programming with functional style
[23:03:02] <technomancy> but if I had gone straight to Lua I would have been lost
[23:03:23] <acdw> i def tend to write functional-first programming, try not to have too muhc state

[23:04:24] <acdw> but like, ... if somebody writes something and /it works/, does it really matter how
[23:04:33] <acdw> (unless you hvae to hack on it, of course)

[23:05:08] <Bayes> technomancy nothing specific, I sometimes wish I had a book "patterns for functional programming" so I could write better R
[23:05:26] <Bayes> not because it's limiting me, but because I'd like to take it the next level
[23:05:33] <technomancy> "it works" is really different from "it's comprehensible and people can make changes to it safely"
[23:05:51] <acdw> mm that's vv true
[23:05:56] <mattf> btw is it possible to colorize messages easily with ERC?
[23:06:01] <glumanda> technomancy: but elisp doesn't have classes, so it is fp?
[23:06:08] <acdw> oh shit technomancy i totally misread your message (I didn't see the "not" in the "not really")
[23:06:11] <Bayes> also, in some IDEs you can pop-up a quick menu and as you type, you get all the references for variables, functions, files, etc that match the keyword... is there something like that in emacs?

[23:09:58] <technomancy> acdw: I guess what I was getting at more was that it's not that you need to avoid state altogether; it's more like you need to understand that state imposes a cost, and spend that cost wisely rather than tossing it around willy-nilly. you can do that in an imperative language.

[23:10:15] <acdw> yes indeed! that makes a lot of sense
[23:10:39] <acdw> like, when i was trying to learn Haskell or configure Xmonad, threading that state through /all/ the functions was really confusing
