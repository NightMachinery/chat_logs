[17:50:31] <Guest65> Hi, I appreciate this is likely an old-worldy question. But I recently rediscovered Mozilla SeaMonkey, which supports reading e-mail files, and it occurred to me that when someone used to say "I'll e-mail myself a reminder", they were simply creating an e-mail file in their own inbox. I'm entrepreneurially minded, and so I often create a new user
[17:50:32] <Guest65> on my computer when I come up with a business idea, to at-a-glance remind me of the different ideas and have profiles for storing documents, etc, respective to the business specs as and when I come across them. However, whereas I might download a PDF file on my main user account and save it to C:\Users\BrilliantIdea#13\Documents\Research, there's
[17:50:32] <Guest65> no similar mechanism that I'm aware of that allows e-mail files (with all the useful features of iCal, etc) to be "sent" or simply moved to a respective local directory e.g. C:\Users\BrilliantIdea#13\Mail\Inbox
[17:50:44] <Guest65> So my question was, is there in-fact a "local MailDir" delivery option, beyond just using the save feature of a particular e-mail/collaboration client, which wouldn't create a communication channel such as with Tasks which support collaborative editing
[17:54:07] <Guest65> I've discovered courier-mta maildrop - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildrop - which supports "delivery" mode, which seems related - Delivery mode is the "normal" mail filtering mode; that is, during final delivery, after the message left the SMTP environment.
[17:55:14] <Guest65> but if someone is aware of an implementation of alternative method to achieve the same objectives without having to run a fully-fledged multi-enterprise project management suite, I'd be interested in suggestions
[17:57:37] <lunaphyte> your objective isn't terribly clear to me, but maybe you'd be interested in something like sieve?
[18:03:55] <Guest65> my objective is to wear many hats in many small businesses and entrepreneurial projects. I don't like the idea of vendor locking myself into a suite which uses a undocumented database, and would much rather just compile a suite of technologies which function used the "Everything is a file" methodology. So in the case of e-mail, it would be
[18:03:56] <Guest65> main@localhost sends (saves a file to) brilliantidea13@localhost. The desire to avoid having daemons and services running disparate inter-operable systems is that resource utilisation quickly becomes unscalable without dedicated hardware.
[18:07:16] <Guest65> so as an example, I want to use a client like Mozilla Thunderbird on my main user account to create a collaborative ToDo .ics file within another users mailbox, such as brilliantidea13@localhost, which corresponds to C:\Users\BrilliantIdea13\MailDir\new
[18:11:10] <Guest65> then I'll find a project management client and related open-source specification (I've just found GroupDAV, not sure whether that's relevant), which expands the feature set of Mozilla Thunderbird, so I can then expand e-mails and tasks to support project management feature-sets, all file-based
[18:12:58] <Guest65> It's essentially similar in concept to the structured-information environment of a collaborative component-based content management system, rather than a publicly editable wiki
[18:20:27] <rob0> Guest65:  sorry, I just looked in
[18:21:02] <Guest65> rob0 thanks. any thoughts on my question?
[18:23:35] <lunaphyte> it may not be what you want to hear, but right now, my impression is that this is an unnecessarily over-engineered concept
[18:27:26] <Guest65> I don't really see why. If anything I see it as under-engineered, because it's literally just files in clients, no databases or web-interfaces, no client/server maintenance. It's within the same scope of Usenet and UUCP, except the network stack isn't involved at all. User-to-User Copy Protocol rather than Unix-to-Unix Copy Protocol. If I were
[18:27:26] <Guest65> using UUCP, there is documentation for an implementation which replaces SMTP - https://phrye.com/tools/uucp-hub/
[18:34:11] <Guest65> If you mean that the multi-user mechanism I'm using is over engineered, possibly. But then to implement good OpSec, I'd have to use additional software for security, where-as atm the built-in encrypted user features of Windows, and runas command for launching software within different profiles makes  it very easy to keep everything organised. The
[18:34:12] <Guest65> issue as I say is when I want to link projects or business ideas together, which I hoping the concept of e-mail solves very neatly
[18:38:28] <rob0> I think it would be inconvenient to manage multiple IMAP accounts.  I think the sieve idea (maybe combined with a recipient delimiter) makes more sense.  But I'm not fully into your idea, so don't read too much into my opinion.
[18:51:07] <Guest65> I don't think with my simple concept, it would be necessary to use IMAP. Mozilla SeaMonkey literally just allows me to navigate to a MailDir folder, which it displays in a similar manner to a read-only FTP listing, and then I open the e-mail file, which displays in a primitive headers and body layout, and obviously HTML renders, etc. So the system
[18:51:07] <Guest65> I was hoping to use for sending e-mails was just SMTP/UUCP and reading is just directly opening a MailDir. I'm trying to avoid using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut, and atm, if I want to make a note to myself on a particular project, or something similar, I pull up "runas /user:brilliantidea13 notepad.exe" and write myself a note. But I'd prefer
[18:51:08] <Guest65> to introduce a trivial collaborative features, which I could achieve by simply writing iCal headered messages and saving them to a MailDir folder, but given mail clients are litterally designed to automate that process, I hoped there was a simply way to redirect the sending of the message to just a file-copy delivery to the corresponding user
[18:51:08] <Guest65> MailDir.
[18:52:36] <Guest65> Similarly a email client would also improve the SeaMonkey e-mail file experience, by offering search features, and buttons to perform different actions

[19:09:34] <rob0> oic.
[19:10:17] <rob0> Sure, if your mail is delivered to your system user account, direct mbox/maildir access should sork.

[20:35:52] <Guest65> yeh, what I was wondering is whether anyone knows of a minimal/simple mail daemon which is well suited for offering "workgroup" e-mail, where messages which are received by it via SMTP/UUCP, simply locate the MailDir within the users profile which corresponds to the alias and drops the mail into it. As I say, I found courier-mta maildrop, which
[20:35:52] <Guest65> I'll look into, but wondered whether anyone else knew of a pre-existing solution/guide
