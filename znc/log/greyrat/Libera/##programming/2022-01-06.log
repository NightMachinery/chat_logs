[00:10:18] <deniska> pyzozord: have you ever tried making a parameterized query through ADO? :)
[00:10:41] <pyzozord> it's also just... something weird about it give input and that input becomes code and it's evaluated

[00:11:30] <deniska> pyzozord: that's pretty much the oldest kind of vulnerabilities, treating user input as executable code
[00:11:49] <deniska> sometimes by mistake, sometimes by deliberate choice, sometimes by necessity
[00:12:24] <pyzozord> i guess this the with great power comes great responsibility situation

[00:13:07] <deniska> I think some databases don't even support parameterization on API level and instead trust libraries to escape inputs properly?
[00:13:11] <pyzozord> all power of programming comes from the same things
[00:13:41] <deniska> then how awkward the API is also plays a role
[00:13:48] <deniska> python's db api is the best I've seen
[00:14:16] <deniska> if you have to instantiate a query object, you've lost some people right here
[00:14:31] <deniska> if you have to instantiate an object per each parameter, you've lost more people
[00:14:45] <pyzozord> maybe those kinds of things like eval() or dbquery() shouldn't work on strings
[00:15:05] <pyzozord> maybe there should be some kind of string-like data structure that cannot be simply taken from input

[00:19:30] <deniska> (but to be fair, actually makes it harder to make mistakes because "subclause" objects are more strongly typed than strings)
[00:19:30] <pyzozord> i guess that's one saving grace of higher abstraction things like ORMs
[00:22:20] <deniska> And in other situations not putting user content in executable context is just unavoidable, like with html

[02:11:09] <jkk> HAHAHAHAH Xd
[02:11:46] <jkk> Convert comments to code. Write a comment describing the logic you want, and let GitHub Copilot assemble the code for you.
[02:11:58] <apotheon> hans: Maybe it's just guessing that if you have something consisting of two dictionary words and ending with a you might want to increment the a to the next couple letters in the alphabet.
[02:12:28] <hans> apotheon: but they're not dictionary words. if you google any of those names, you get 0 search results: even google has never heard of them before
[02:12:38] <apotheon> "block" and "dicks" are words
[02:12:40] <hans> because i made them up like 20 minutes ago
[02:12:42] <hans> yeah true
[02:12:57] <apotheon> That's why I said "consisting of *two* dictionary words . . .".
[02:13:05] <jkk> In the first day, GitHub Copilot already taught me about a nuance in Javascript object comparison and is as comfortable with our database schema as I am. This is the single most mind-blowing application of ML Iâ€™ve ever seen.

[04:14:04] <[itchyjunk]> but what about an OS
[04:14:25] <EdFletcher> yeah, it's _many_ data structures. programming is literally just about the data. Rob Pike said it like so: "Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming."

[04:15:06] <[itchyjunk]> how is it structured?
[04:15:32] <EdFletcher> that's a massive topic, you'd have to go inspect them for yourself. the linux kernel _loves_ the linked list, i will say that much. 
[04:17:00] <EdFletcher> data structures are obviously shaped for the specific usage, so each subsystem in a kernel will have its own structures depending on what it needs and what it's doing. as you found, filesystems tend to use complex structures like b-trees as they need the efficiency inherent in them for their particular use case(s). 
[04:17:30] <[itchyjunk]> well me insistently asking question in irc is me inspecting it!

[04:25:34] <nomagno> Essentially, while a monolithic kernel handles interfacing with programs all by itself with different no-very-separate services, a microkernel leaves almost all interfaces to userspace
[04:25:40] <[itchyjunk]> I feel like I am missing out a lot of concepts because I don't know C
[04:25:54] <oldlaptop> Not much more than process spawning/scheduling and IPC actually happens in the kernel itself.

[04:26:37] <oldlaptop> The concept has turned out not to be all that successful in practice, outside some peculiar embedded applications.
[04:26:43] <[itchyjunk]> so handeling memory means there is a datastructure in kernel for this

[05:05:29] <ProfSimm> oldlaptop: this opens up more opportunities for parallel execution when we look at it like this too
[05:05:50] <oldlaptop> CPUs have been exploiting those opportunities to the hilt for a long while
[05:05:59] <ProfSimm> It's inevitable
[05:05:59] <oldlaptop> at least to where the hilt is at their level
[05:06:29] <ProfSimm> Any evolved system seems to do it. CPUs, compilers, databases.
[05:06:35] <ProfSimm> And animals and humans too.
[05:06:52] <ProfSimm> Only dumb automatons do literally what you spelled out.

[11:25:21] <apotheon> 00:51 < apotheon> Maybe that's flashbacks from LSD stored in your body fat.
[11:25:24] <apotheon> 00:51 < tomathy> possibly
[11:25:40] <tomathy> i assumed you meant that fat itself contains LSD 
[11:25:44] <apotheon> nope
[11:25:47] <ProfSimm> Why does IRC use < and > I mean those are not brackets
[11:25:48] <apotheon> not by nature
[11:25:53] <ProfSimm> Wait, why does HTML use them
[11:26:08] <apotheon> because they're directional, like bookends
[11:26:33] <tomathy> or inaction
[11:26:34] <apotheon> and because SGML used them
[11:26:36] <ProfSimm> By that rationale, we can use d and b same way

[11:26:54] <ProfSimm> :P

[15:18:03] <Decker> ya but - what's with this wave of twitter bans?  I mean what could responsible adults possibly be saying that's so horrible?  Can't people just block them if they don't like them? why do they have to be auto blocked by the world - without an opt-in option?
[15:18:08] <macaw> Oops, accidental "Return" press. I've seen one of his podcast on vaccines and it indeed was mind-blowing. I will have to watch the newer ones. Thanks for the recommendation. ;)
[15:18:22] <mrig> I dont regret it, mostly on there because I admire the way that he is able to take all the crap and say what he believes in an open minded way. I don't completely agree with his stance, but do admire him.

[15:51:43] <macaw> mrig: I haven't even dug into how common compression formats for music files work, but it makes sense. There should be different compression formats for different kinds of recorded media. Kinda like JPEG vs. PNG (or some better format). JPEG was great for photos of natural scenery, but it breaks down when there is a lot of information packed in, like for exporting fragment shader output.

[16:33:43] <macaw> mrig: I knew about the cultural and philosophical entanglenment and that scared me off. I learned a lot about (and from) buddhism, though.
[16:34:27] <mrig> buddhism rejects a lot of it, but that is the after the fact doctrine, I think, which somewhat misses the point.
[16:34:29] <macaw> mrig: Thank you very much. Big ":)".
[16:35:44] <mrig> You are quite welcome, surprisingly relevant today, due to the highly advanced knowledge of grammar and the nature of time that it engenders.

[22:49:20] <InPhase> ProfSimm: Probably because the people paying extra for iPhones are people with more money to spend on frivolities, and thus they buy more apps.  It's not a surprising result.

[22:50:24] <ProfSimm> InPhase: it's amazing how there's a cynical reason for everything Apple does better
[22:50:25] <apotheon> 6502 was the basis of a lot of fun, back in the day.
[22:51:14] <apotheon> I have no idea how people are using 6502 arch now.
[22:51:16] <InPhase> ProfSimm: I would make this sort of analysis about any market.  It's not anyone doing something better, it speaks to a difference in the customer base, as they are obviously making different choices about what to do with their money.
[22:51:16] <psydroid> most of the profits in the computer industry go to Apple from what I've read
[22:51:21] <oldlaptop> InPhase: It's also AIUI more expensive for developers to participate, which (conjecture time!) could have a strong effect on the number of non-"purchased" apps that exist in the first place.

[22:52:51] <InPhase> oldlaptop: I tend to appreciate the large number of options for Android apps, although every once in a while there's garbage to sort through to find the right ones.  Fortunately, you can usually filter pretty quickly by download count if you don't want to spend time on details.
[22:53:34] <apotheon> I'd rather have to sift through garbage to find the good thing I want than to sift through a single choice that isn't quite what I want.
[22:53:43] <InPhase> oldlaptop: I actually have money to spend on apps, and don't mind it once in a while if there's a good one.  But usually there is a free one available that does what I want just fine.
[22:54:03] * oldlaptop uses F-Droid solely and entirely as a garbage-exclusion filter, on the theory that the garbage that's there is at least /probably/ not going to be malicious garbage
[22:54:13] <apotheon> oldlaptop: good point

[22:55:08] <InPhase> inhahe: Amazon taught me to not trust high ratings from things obtained by few people.  They can be fake ratings.
[22:55:23] <inhahe> i go by rating, but i think it's awkward that you can't order the results by rating in the play store
[22:55:28] <inhahe> so you're never quite sure you got teh highest rating
[22:55:48] <apotheon> I check recent ratings as well as download count.  All too often, I discover something turned to shit recently.
[22:56:43] <InPhase> inhahe: Also when I skim through ratings, many times it's "Doesn't work on my phone X" repeatedly for some phone I don't have, so I don't penalize for that as it won't impact me.  So I do sort of factor in rating, but it's not the primary thing.

[23:35:04] <apotheon> I did not know that about dd.
[23:35:20] <apotheon> please no fish for sh

[23:35:25] <apotheon> gawd no
[23:35:38] <pyzozord> so i guess in unix 6 they indeed used find | grep kind of thing
[23:35:48] <nomagno> apptheon: They technically aim for POSIX compliance :P
[23:35:50] <apotheon> Toybox sh is a nice choice.  I'm cool with oksh and dash, too.
[23:36:13] <apotheon> nomagno: Nobody should ever install fish.
[23:36:30] <apotheon> I'm pretty sure that fish started as a joke that then got out of hand (coincidentally with that whole dd syntax thing).
[23:36:30] <nomagno> dash is frustrating because it doesn't support wide characters
[23:36:32] <nomagno> And POSIX mandates it

[23:50:54] <apotheon> I remember when I discovered Ypsilon Scheme's REPL made a better Windows shell than cmd, command, or PowerShell.
[23:50:58] <apotheon> That was fun.
[23:51:25] <apotheon> (speaking of programming languages as the basis of a shell)
[23:51:29] <deniska> powershell is like gnu turned up to 11

[23:53:48] <apotheon> Well, it does seem like a mere sign of worse aspects of the job.
[23:53:49] <pulse> isn't powershell good
[23:53:56] <pulse> everyone who uses powershell tells me it's literally the best thing ever
[23:54:05] <pulse> i've never actively used it myself though so i can't tell
[23:54:13] <apotheon> I loathe PowerShell.
[23:54:18] <pulse> like, i'm pretty sure it's better than bash
[23:54:24] <pulse> by a light year, probably
[23:54:30] <deniska> it'sâ€¦ not exactly the best thing ever, but much better than cmd.exe, and it's sorta better than unix shell in a way which is kinda hard to describe
[23:54:39] <apotheon> Maybe the reason people who use PowerShell like it is the fact that people who don't like it don't use it.
[23:54:45] <pulse> i'd rather make a machine out of LEGO to automate things than use Bash ever again, lol
[23:54:55] <pulse> it's just a miserable experience
[23:54:59] <pulse> Bash < 5 lines is fine

[23:55:24] *** Joins: Chanakan5591 (~Chanakan5@user/chanakan5591)
[23:55:27] <deniska> like, unix shell is certainly much more pleasant to use to actually do day-to-day interactive tasks. Powershell is much more pleasant to write scripts because it's more resembling a programming language
[23:55:32] <apotheon> PowerShell and Bash share a problem: they don't know whether they're shells or programming languages.

[23:55:51] <pulse> powershell is .NET based, right?
[23:55:54] <apotheon> The difference is that Bash is limited by legacy to have to conform more to the interactive shell use, while PowerShell is not.
[23:55:57] <pulse> so you can actually use .NET

[23:56:01] <pulse> Bash is just... random
[23:56:08] <deniska> pulse: yeah, but actually using .net is awkward, at this point may as well reach for C#
[23:56:17] *** Quits: RawFiend (~textual@92.45.117.58) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:56:25] <pulse> idk, i've been told by people who use powershell daily that it's really, really powerful
[23:56:33] <pulse> i'm inclined to believe their judgment on this
[23:56:39] <deniska> Like, unix shell is an awkward programming language because it's a tool for starting program with a PL capabilities bolted on top
[23:56:44] <pulse> but then again, i have 0 experience with it
[23:56:58] <deniska> PowerShell is an awkward programming language because they mimic too many things which make shell not great PL
[23:57:06] <apotheon> Both Bash and PowerShell are quite clumsy for scripting, and both have some issues with interactive use.  Bash seems better for interactive use, up to a point, while PowerShell seems better for scripting, except sometimes.
[23:57:14] <nomagno> PowerShell is very powerful, no doubt, but the interfaces are a complete mess for something that has 'shell' in the anme
[23:57:17] <nomagno> s/anme/name/
[23:57:42] <nomagno> Too many interfaces and language features IMHO
[23:57:45] <apotheon> pulse: C is more powerful than PowerShell, but I wouldn't want to literally run a read-compile-execute-print-loop of C for my shell.
[23:58:06] <apotheon> "powerful" is not a sole determinant of "good"
[23:58:07] <oldlaptop> apotheon: For what definition of "power"?
[23:58:08] <deniska> I often still ran bash on windows because I could never remember which combination of -weird -keys does whatever grep in unixy shell does
[23:58:14] <apotheon> oldlaptop: that too
[23:58:25] <apotheon> oldlaptop: I'm going by the feel of what pulse said.
[23:58:47] <oldlaptop> If we want to be really pedantic, C is categorically less "powerful" than most common computer languages, if you buy the argument that it is not Turing-complete (and instead merely LBA-complete)
[23:58:57] <apotheon> 13:26 < deniska> Like, unix shell is an awkward programming language because it's a tool for starting program with a PL capabilities bolted on top
[23:59:01] <apotheon> 13:26 < deniska> PowerShell is an awkward programming language because they mimic too many things which make shell not great PL
[23:59:04] <apotheon> EXCELLENT DESCRIPTION
[23:59:11] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: LBA?
[23:59:15] <nomagno> *nix tools can not compare themselves with powershell for text processing
[23:59:26] <pulse> little big adventure? :D
[23:59:27] <oldlaptop> Linear Bounded Automaton; essentially a Turing machine with a finite tape
[23:59:30] <apotheon> This is why I advocate against using shell syntax for programming in a significant way.
[23:59:41] <pulse> aren't all languages that
[23:59:51] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: thanks, also great description
