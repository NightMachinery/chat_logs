[02:12:20] <DevJohnC> what's a good verb to replace "Add" that conveys the API in question is idempotent?
[02:13:18] <xb0o2> AddIfDoesNotExist? :-)
[02:13:26] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: HashSet uses Add
[02:13:28] <xb0o2> It's .NET, just add as many words as you can
[02:13:37] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: but returns bool for success or not ;)
[02:13:55] <DevJohnC> Suchiman, that annoys the shit out of me, it isn't even TryAdd
[02:14:08] <xb0o2> DevJohnC: what's the deal if it already exists?
[02:14:11] <xb0o2> Exception, no-op?
[02:14:20] <DevJohnC> noop
[02:14:56] <xb0o2> I might stick with Add if it was a reasonable expectation for the type of collection you're dealing with
[02:15:25] <xb0o2> (Or whatever API you're creating)
[02:15:48] <xb0o2> Or I would genuinely avoid trying to be clever and make it verbose enough to be obvious that it's either an add or a no-op
[02:15:55] <xb0o2> Either by naming or return type
[02:16:08] <DevJohnC> bleh, fine
[02:16:39] <xb0o2> It's never an interesting answer :-(
[02:16:56] <phrosty> i vote for TryAdd

[04:57:32] <Guest80> this could be the next 'common cold'
[04:57:41] <Guest80> or just require another booster
[04:58:06] <Guest80> or be a complete dud (best case)
[04:58:39] <lz_> given how often they told us new variants were gonna be less severe and they weren't, I don't have my hopes high up
[04:59:09] <BtbN> It's too early to know much of anything.
[04:59:25] <BtbN> If this is as severe as all the other variants... This will kill millions.
[04:59:44] <BtbN> Will also depend a lot on how effective the current vaccines are.
[05:02:02] <Guest80> my intuition tells me they wouldnt be announcing it so widely if they didnt know 90% already
[05:02:07] <Guest80> but who knows ya

[05:03:55] <BtbN> Not much else is known yet
[05:04:00] <lz_> there's already one case detected in belgium
[05:04:08] <BtbN> We know about its existence for shorter than the usual time from infection to hospitalisation, soo
[05:04:14] <lz_> so it's basically already everywhere
[05:04:31] <BtbN> There is a case in Belgium which has zero connection to SA even
[05:04:35] <Guest80> ya its like reacting to thunder when lightning already struck
[05:06:27] <lz_> apparently it evolved with just 1 person getting reinfected over and over: https://twitter.com/kallmemeg/status/1464211115831930884#m
[05:06:40] <BtbN> Like that Tweet thread says, it's so early that every possible outcome is possible, including a complete statistical dud
[05:06:48] <lz_> not reinfected, but "chronically infected" whatever that means
[05:07:13] <BtbN> Yeah, if you are chronically infected, you're a virus evolution machine
[05:09:05] <lz_> I wonder when I can have holidays now
[05:09:37] <lz_> I just had my 3rd shot date and I was already hearing about how israel are having 4th shots lol
[05:09:52] <BtbN> They might need to finally refresh the vaccine
[05:09:59] <BtbN> Wonder why they didn't do it for Delta already
[05:10:33] <BtbN> My booster shot isn't until Early january. Because government decided "6 months at the earliest", while science says "6 month at the latest". Just great.
[05:11:13] <lz_> I got lucky because I took the date 1 hour before they announced everyone should have it. now next available dates are in january/february
[05:11:32] <BtbN> I might have to side-channel the system to get mine
[05:11:46] <BtbN> i.e. my father owns a doctory office
[05:11:49] <BtbN> *s
[05:16:46] <moose> BtbN: Just curious which scientific research are you referring to about 6 months at the latest for the general population?
[05:17:01] <moose> AFAIK it's only recommended to get the third if you are immunocompromised or over 50 years old
[05:18:11] <lz_> moose: here they recommend the shot to everyone after 5 months (unless < 12 I think)
[05:18:23] <moose> Where is here? Again, just curious :p
[05:18:26] <lz_> vaccines' efficiency drops by half after like 6 months
[05:18:30] <lz_> france
[05:18:44] <moose> In the US they are not recommending this and I've not seen any evidence suggesting a drop off in effectiveness against say the Moderna vaccine.
[05:19:02] <lz_> all arn vaccines drop in efficiency afaik
[05:19:08] <moose> There's a drop-off in effectiveness at preventing all illness, yes, but it's nothing crazy. Like -5% or something.
[05:19:20] <lz_> no it's big
[05:19:21] <moose> But also this vaccine is I believe one of the most effective ever produced for a respiratory illness.
[05:19:31] <moose> Like, flu shot is 40% effective on average heh
[05:19:48] <lz_> https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-drops-after-6-months-study-2021-10-04/
[05:19:53] <moose> Ah ha, thank you.
[05:19:54] <lz_> Vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant was 93% after the first month, declining to 53% after four months. Against other coronavirus variants, efficacy declined to 67% from 97%.
[05:20:14] <moose> For preventing all illness, yes?
[05:21:02] <BtbN> it drops to 44% after ~4 months, for women. It's even worse for men.
[05:21:39] <moose> I see an unreviewed preliminary study for Pfizer's vaccine, but nothing Moderna
[05:21:40] <moose> :/
[05:21:58] <lz_> I don't know if you're still well protected against severe forms but my guess is after 6 months you're twice likely to get severely ill
[05:22:22] <BtbN> The Study also analyzed that
[05:22:32] <lz_> https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20211105/covid-vaccine-protection-drops-study
[05:22:35] <moose> I received my second Moderna shot in February.
[05:22:38] <lz_>  The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson dropped dramatically as the Delta variant swept the United States, a study of almost 800,000 veterans found.
[05:22:38] <BtbN> https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3949410
[05:22:47] <moose> So, pretty curious because I don't desire to lose my lungs heh
[05:22:52] <lz_> The Moderna two-dose vaccine went from being 89% effective in March to 58% effective in September
[05:23:14] <BtbN> Yeah, Moderna pretty much went with the "More vaccine helps more" approach
[05:23:22] <BtbN> it has twice the dosage compared to biontech :D
[05:23:31] <BtbN> Which is the most likely reason for it performing better
[05:24:07] <moose> I don't like the speculation in the WebMD article. They add their two cents of "The study confirms the need for booster vaccines" but it doesn't.
[05:24:30] <moose> They also don't even reference or link to the study.
[05:24:51] <lz_> yes they do
[05:25:00] <moose> I'll look again then.
[05:25:08] <BtbN> "The effectiveness against severe illness seems to remain high through 9 months, although not for men, older frail individuals, and individuals with comorbidities." great
[05:25:11] <lz_> you have to expand the "Sources" at the bottom
[05:25:28] <moose> Ah, tiny little thing there
[05:25:30] <moose> Thanks
[05:25:53] <moose> It's a reference to LA Times though, which is behind a paywall.

[05:28:47] <moose> My PCP said I did not need to get the third shot.
[05:28:50] <lz_> the drop gets crazy after 5 months
[05:29:17] <moose> He's like "You are in an age group with a correlated risk for heart inflammation caused by the vaccine and effectiveness is good enough with the two shots protecting from the most serious forms of disease"
[05:29:32] <BtbN> Right in time for mandatory family christmas events, great

[05:29:52] <moose> did outweigh, sorry

[05:30:31] <moose> I refuse to mix the two tbh
[05:31:01] <lz_> here they did a 2nd pfizer shot for ppl who had moderna I think (or maybe I mix up with jensen)
[05:31:05] <moose> It's probably totally irrational thinking to mix the two.
[05:31:15] <moose> To not want to mix the two anyway
[05:31:24] <moose> But I am more worried of that, than just getting the dang thing.
[05:31:46] <moose> If I'd gotten the J&J though, different story, I'd be just getting a new series honestly

[05:31:50] <lz_> I'm not worried at all, I'd do a shot of each a week if it was needed :D
[05:31:55] <BtbN> They banned its use for younger than 30 years here

[05:40:18] <moose> Yes they are, I am aware. Seen people die from it.
[05:41:47] <moose> But I've also seen the other side, people who recovered from the imminent death phase and have returned to a life that is equivalent to that of a 80 year old person, but they're 40.
[05:41:49] <lz_> I read it's not really clear whether "long covid" is actually a thing

[05:42:11] <moose> It's not clear what the cause is, it may actually be a result of high flow oxygen therapy.
[05:42:42] <moose> That's known to really diminish your lung capacity if used for a long period of time (more than a day or two)
[05:43:40] <lz_> I think the tldr is "we don't really know" : https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/claim-that-french-study-showed-long-covid-doesnt-exist-misinterprets-study-fails-to-account-for-limitations/

[21:18:24] <Lukky> Hi
[21:18:25] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Can you explain your concurrency one a bit more please?
[21:18:39] <bpmedley> Lukky : Morning
[21:18:42] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Yeah but like what if request timed out, but actually went through
[21:18:59] <MatthiasVance> Ahh that is a good one
[21:19:03] <Nasp> Like due to networking, or just you only waited 30 secs or whatever the default HttpClient timeout is
[21:19:10] <Nasp> Then you retry and maybe double create a resource
[21:19:47] <MatthiasVance> So it's more about client side timeouts then?
[21:20:00] <MatthiasVance> That's definitely something I could fix
[21:20:02] <MatthiasVance> "fix"
[21:20:07] <MatthiasVance> More like "take into account"
[21:20:08] <MatthiasVance> :D
[21:20:48] <Nasp> Well it could also happen on their end as well
[21:21:01] <Lukky> I'm pondering how to waste my raise... iPad pro, or Surface?
[21:21:08] <Nasp> Like the http request times out, but the request was sent to the database or other backend system
[21:21:14] <Nasp> Btw how do you communicate with this api
[21:21:20] <Nasp> Is it sync or message bus mased or
[21:21:28] <MatthiasVance> Yeah but that's not something I could fix, but then idempotency comes around of course
[21:21:47] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: I'm just brainstorming "challenges when integrating with third parties (through APIs)"
[21:21:54] <MatthiasVance> Because I'm defining product scope
[21:22:28] <Nasp> We have over 200 integrations and it's a fucking pain
[21:22:50] <MatthiasVance> Ideally I want to know *all* the pains :D
[21:23:20] <MatthiasVance> Or rather, the to-some-degree-aggregated version
[21:25:00] <biberu> MatthiasVance: yes, it is

[22:04:12] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Well our situation is kinda opposite, since our API is the one being consumed
[22:04:20] <Nasp> But it's just some of the isssues i've noticed  as well
[22:04:40] <Nasp> Anyways monitor the usage, we have plenty of integration that are just stuck on a loop
[22:04:46] <Nasp> Doesn't even check return status codes
[22:05:50] <biberu> that's a good one Nasp
[22:07:01] <biberu> how do you handle those clients on your end?
[22:07:12] <MatthiasVance> I've also added "restrictions on usage" as a possible challenge
[22:07:17] <Nasp> Hmm well once in a while i write to them and ban them
[22:07:25] <Nasp> But now we have a few more people on it, so now i can just delegate it
[22:07:28] <Nasp> Which makes it a lot easier
[22:07:45] <Nasp> We have some basic rate limits in place but it's nowhere near enough
[22:07:54] *** Quits: RangerBobVA (~bmaddox@user/rangerbobva) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:08:04] <Nasp> We just had one integration that was like 35% of all requests

[22:08:46] <biberu> "good news! you're going on the "special" price plan!"
[22:09:30] <Nasp> We just removed their access
[22:09:33] <Nasp> But it happens so often
[22:09:43] <MatthiasVance> Good one "Monitor usage/cost"
[22:09:58] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  But you are in the opposite situation right?
[22:10:05] <MatthiasVance> I am in no situation
[22:10:10] <Nasp> Well will be
[22:10:34] <MatthiasVance> Not necessarily, because those challenges will need to be resolved on both ends, so for now I'm just getting as many challenges written down as I can
[22:10:48] <MatthiasVance> To also see where I can provide the most value
[22:12:14] <Nasp> Okay then contact information
[22:12:21] <Nasp> You should be able to contac tthose who use your api
[22:12:29] <Nasp> And once a year make sure it's updated
[22:12:38] <Nasp> Also expire all clients who haven't made request in a year

[22:19:31] <MatthiasVance> Hm got one more: relational information
[22:35:21] <Lukky> What do you guys think of Jupyter? Is it worth digging into? Any of you using it on a "reguluar" basis?
[22:37:21] <MichaelLong> hm is that a locally running web-based editor for C# or do I see that correctly?
[22:37:54] <Lukky> Something like that, yes
[22:38:05] <Lukky> apparently it supports many languages
[22:38:07] <MichaelLong> why on earth would anybody using that!??
[22:38:29] <Lukky> don't know, I just came across it while wasting time on the web :-)
[22:40:57] <MichaelLong> apparently it is something for "data science" (always love this therm) and such.
[22:41:27] <Lukky> I see it as more of a "presentation" thing
[22:42:07] <Lukky> nevertheless, it's interesting to see what developers do
[22:42:18] <MichaelLong> I'm on their page and it is again one of those project pages which struggle to explain what it is for in detail and not just by dropping some buzz words
[22:42:30] <Lukky> hehe
[22:43:08] <MichaelLong> but you're right it is more catered towards presenting "data science" stuff in an web environment.
[22:43:29] <Lukky> I tried some online notebooks (they have some supporting C#, F#, PowerShell), but I can't really feel the buzz
[22:45:07] <MichaelLong> the thing is, as interesting that kind of tools might be, in the end I need something that is proven to work. so when I've to do stuff at work I'll resort to a traditional IDE to get stuff done.
[22:45:42] <Lukky> yeah
[22:46:35] <MichaelLong> I don't want to spend to much time into fancy tools rather than spending that time on my actual work, but as a hobby thing it is different of course
[22:46:41] <Lukky> I mean, I even tried to get into VS Code at some point, and got tired of messing with add-ons and their constant revisions fucking up everything, so I'll stick to good old VS
[22:47:12] <MichaelLong> Lukky, exactly my experince wis vs code
[22:47:20] <MichaelLong> *with
[22:47:29] <Lukky> It reminded me too much of Netbeans/Java
[22:47:44] <Lukky> a constant struggle to get things to even compile
[22:47:59] <MichaelLong> you cannot really make it into "real" Visual Studio. I had all weird errors coming from plugins when testing it out
[22:48:05] *** Joins: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien)
[22:48:14] <Lukky> well, I'm glad I'm not the only one feeling that way about VS Code :-)
[22:48:27] <MichaelLong> I mean that was clear from the beginning but yeah you want to know how far you can get the experience
[22:49:36] <Lukky> I guess it's fun when you're young and have a lot of time on your hands, but at some point you have to be selective about what you do with your time :-)
[22:49:49] <MichaelLong> yep
[22:49:58] <Lukky> I wish we had that kind of stuff back in the early 80's
[22:50:04] <MichaelLong> heh
[22:52:16] <MichaelLong> I mean, in our field of work, the beginners probably don't grasp that they have a far better starting environment than previous generations
[22:52:45] <MichaelLong> (although you can say that for every new generation)
[22:53:37] <Lukky> yes, but the "explosion" of the late 80's/early 90's has been pretty unique I think
[22:53:59] <Lukky> I remember when Netscape came out... that was the shits!!!
[22:54:18] <Lukky> all we had before that was gopher like tools :-)
[22:55:22] <Lukky> The timing was pretty good... Linux, X, PCs dropping in price, SLIP, and so on...
[22:55:34] <Lukky> modems becoming faster
[22:55:44] <Lukky> 56k faster :D
[22:56:03] <Lukky> and good old IRC
[22:56:41] <BtbN> It depends a lot on how you define better.
[22:57:18] <BtbN> I'm taking a university course right now where they teach low level Unix (effectively Linux) C programming, syscalls and all that.
[22:57:30] <BtbN> Majority of students are like "Who the hell needs that, why do I have to learn that"
[22:57:34] <Lukky> In our case (meaning the old coots like myself), better basically meant "available" lol
[22:58:00] <BtbN> I'm worried that in 1~2 generations, there's going to be noone around with enough expertise to maintain their "NodeJS launcher"
[22:58:17] <Lukky> BtbN: do they have you read APUE?
[22:58:30] <MichaelLong> Lukky, I remember I missed the nescape times but have it seen in use
[22:58:54] <BtbN> Nah, it's probably on the recommended literature list, but there is no mandatory books
[22:59:01] <Lukky> ok
[22:59:10] <Lukky> you shoulkd get it though
[22:59:22] <BtbN> I'm working with Linux for close to 20 years. I think I'm good.
[22:59:44] <Lukky> of course many things have evolved since its release, but it's a good read
[22:59:55] <Lukky> BtbN :-)
[23:00:05] <BtbN> I just want a degree, so I have to sit through stuff like that.

[23:01:29] <Lukky> with inaccuracies that is
[23:01:35] <BtbN> The english Title of that could also be a ponti scheme introduction
[23:01:59] <BtbN> It was literally translated from German, and the double meaning of "networking" doesn't exist there
[23:02:06] <MichaelLong> but the syscall-complains I had 15 years ago too, the I was at university
[23:02:13] <Lukky> what's the original german word?

[23:05:59] <Lukky> I wish I could live in Germany for 6-12 months, just so my brain can "kick" into german mode
[23:06:11] <BtbN> Wouldn't recommend right now
[23:06:20] <BtbN> Though not like any other country is much better.
[23:06:25] <Lukky> yeah, my exact thoughts
[23:06:46] <MichaelLong> probably wouldn't study computer science anymore
[23:06:54] <Lukky> travel is not what it used to be
[23:07:13] <BtbN> I did a systems administrator apprenticeship with 24. Sitting in school with 16 year old was quite something.
[23:07:33] <Lukky> tell me about it :O
[23:07:49] <Lukky> I was 26 and in college
[23:07:56] <BtbN> That's about normal though
[23:08:02] <BtbN> I mean, it's about as you expect. It's a school, with a bunch of kids in it.
[23:08:04] <Lukky> I'd get into arguments with those kids all the time
[23:08:08] <BtbN> And teachers who are sometimes younger than you
[23:08:14] <Lukky> hehe, true
[23:09:05] <Lukky> with no real life experience of what they're teaching... but that's still much better than a 55+ years old teacher with no real life experience of what he's teaching !!!
[23:09:17] <Lukky> we had a few
[23:09:34] <Lukky> actually, we had many
[23:11:03] <BtbN> The primary issue of that school system in Germany is, that the curiculum was made in the 80s
[23:11:17] <BtbN> so they're teching you about Net Classes in IPv4, and other ancient stuff
[23:11:59] <Lukky> well, IPv4 is still very much in use
[23:12:14] <BtbN> But with CIDR
[23:12:23] <BtbN> literally nobody uses netclasses anymore
[23:12:27] <BtbN> since... 20~30 years or so
[23:12:57] <Lukky> I admit I have no clue what you're refering to :-D
[23:13:10] <BtbN> The old old Class A, B and C networks
[23:13:18] <BtbN> Way before subnet masks were "invented"
[23:13:26] <Lukky> oh
[23:13:47] <Lukky> is that even still in use?
[23:13:54] <BtbN> no
[23:14:02] <BtbN> we'd have run out of networks in the 90s if it was
[23:14:41] <Lukky> are they just introducing it, or talking at length about it?
[23:14:54] <BtbN> They are teaching it like that's how the internet works
[23:14:56] <BtbN> it's ridiculous
[23:15:04] <Lukky> maybe they feel there are still a lot of stacks out there using it...
[23:15:31] <BtbN> The teachers are obviously aware of it being long dead, and of the existence of IPv6. But the official final exams don't care, so they got to prepare you for those
[23:15:56] <Lukky> yeah, germans run by the book
[23:16:12] <Lukky> I've learned that the hard way
[23:16:25] <BtbN> I _think_ they finally reformed all that stuff a year or two ago
[23:16:31] <BtbN> took them 30 years
