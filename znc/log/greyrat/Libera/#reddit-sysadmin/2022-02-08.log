[02:52:48] <Cl0udNinja> I dont need any of that bullshit
[02:52:48] <Jaelae> i once logged into a customers account and they had bought every upsell imagineable
[02:52:51] <Cl0udNinja> I need a domain
[02:52:56] <Cl0udNinja> fuckoff with yourupsells!
[02:53:03] <Jaelae> including all the other domains that had misspelling
[02:53:49] <Cl0udNinja> a place I worked very briefly last year was like that, for EVERY DOMAIN, and they had thousands
[02:54:27] <Cl0udNinja> and they went and setup most of that shit at other places after the fact, except SSL
[02:54:33] <Jaelae> i had an old boss like that. he wanted every domain so if someone typed in something wrong he got the traffic
[02:54:38] <Jaelae> which im sure was worth the money - not
[02:54:55] <Cl0udNinja> it can be, depending on the company size / niche
[02:55:02] <Cl0udNinja> typosquatting is a thing
[02:55:02] <Jaelae> he even wanted a 4 letter domain that was just not even a real word
[02:55:09] <Jaelae> and paid $80k for it cause the owner wanted 80k
[02:55:15] <Cl0udNinja> lool
[02:55:28] <Jaelae> it was valued at nothing though because its nonsense
[02:56:15] <sd> 14<B​an> damn voice.com sold for 30 mil
[02:56:19] <Jaelae> typos sure but lets say the site was tools.com - he got toolz.com and toools.com and anything else you can think. then he got tools.net.toolz.net, tools.us, etc
[02:56:20] <Oliber> we have a 5 word domain along side our normal one, because management thought it would be a good idea
[02:56:22] <Cl0udNinja> THIS JUST IN: domains are only really $15-30 and paying more than that is dumb af (special TLDs excluded)
[02:56:55] <Oliber> said domain name is 28 characters, with no tld
[02:56:56] <DrGibby> we have a two character domain 
[02:57:03] <Cl0udNinja> :o
[02:57:09] <Jaelae> i had to buy a dedicated web server to just host all of the websites. when obama got elected in the US, he wanted to separate his company into a bunch of companies with under 50 employees
[02:57:11] <technonerd> DrGibby:  owns io.io
[02:57:16] <Jaelae> which meant unique websites for each one
[02:57:22] <DrGibby> regularly get offers of ~1mil
[02:57:48] <Cl0udNinja> yeah so I bought download-more-database.com today
[02:57:50] <Oliber> sounds lowball
[02:58:05] <Cl0udNinja> sites done... just waiting for the registrar to get shit through so I can fix nameservers
[02:58:22] <Cl0udNinja> I really should put these behind cloudflare or something..

[03:09:54] <monr0e> Cl0udninja whilst I'm loathe to support a monopoly, cloudflare really does have a super fast turnaround for pushing DNS changes.
[03:10:08] <monr0e> probably helps that I also use cloudflare to *provide* my dns though...
[03:10:27] <DrGibby> yeah, everything I host uses cloudflare 
[03:11:00] <MikeSpears> Yep I use namesilo as my registrar and cloudflare for dns
[03:11:08] <Cl0udNinja> yeh, I dont typically get much traffic to anything so my giveafuck level is pretty low
[03:11:31] <DrGibby> even on the sites where I do, its not a huge deal 
[03:12:32] <Cl0udNinja> I just wish there were other alternatives to cloudflare, because I hate the fact that when they go down, more than half the internet goes too
[03:12:52] <monr0e> hence why mys dislike of monopilisation
[03:16:00] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> docker watchtower is so useful for home prod, but I'd like to implement change control. Suggestions what to google? I'm thinking an Azure Devops ticket gets created when a new container version is found, and somehow I just approve it and it gets auto deployed
[03:31:11] <monr0e> In theory you could use something like git or svn, which I think also supports notification emails and diff comparisons. Add a script to build form source and that might function in the way you're after. It's maybe more work though, I'm not that familiar with docker
[03:31:28] <monr0e> You could also host a repo locally, if you wanted
[03:32:23] <monr0e> I think Github Enterprise supports local git? There's also Gogs and Gitea
[03:32:34] <monr0e> https://gogs.io/
[03:32:35] <monr0e> https://gitea.io/en-us/
[03:33:01] <monr0e> The latter two are small-footprint services, so in theory you don't need to put aside very much space for them
[03:33:22] <Cl0udNinja> gitlab, gitlab-ci (or github, whichever), trigger docker build and push to azure in an unreleased state, manual intervention to mark as latest
[03:33:30] <Cl0udNinja> and / or move it to a different account, etc
[03:33:35] <monr0e> That ^
[03:35:52] <Cl0udNinja> you could even setup gitlab-ci to have a manual step that waits for approval

[03:53:07] <Cl0udNinja> random idea, I dont go on dockerhub often enough to know
[03:53:36] <Cl0udNinja> maybe they have a way to add a webhook or something that gets called on your account when an image is updated for specific images or something
[03:53:57] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I don't think so for free accounts. I think paid accounts do
[03:54:26] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> all this is way too complicated for right now though
[03:54:34] <Cl0udNinja> honestly I'd just go for the easiest route
[03:55:09] <Cl0udNinja> make your own daemon that checks the dockerhub api for the images you want, and then use the azure devops azure api to register the azure side of things

[03:57:13] <Cl0udNinja> I mean you could, but you dont even need to put it in a container. you only need python modules that are already available on any system, and the actions dont even involve anything worth the container overhead

[04:07:06] <shakygator> container all the things
[04:07:20] <PattyCakes> we're literally containering all the things
[04:07:25] <Cl0udNinja> PattyCakes, its not new tech though lol. containers have been a thing for 20+ years..
[04:07:31] <Cl0udNinja> openvz, kvm, lxc
[04:07:33] <PattyCakes> about half way through a 5ish year process
[04:07:40] <PattyCakes> oh I'm not getting into this tonight
[04:07:43] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[04:07:43] <PattyCakes> I'm too fucking high for this shit
[04:07:44] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[04:07:45] <shakygator> but we never had the tooling for them like we do now
[04:07:50] <shakygator> plus, cloud
[04:07:52] <shakygator> and kubernetes
[04:08:10] <Cl0udNinja> but yeah containers have been a thing for a long time, theres some things docker did to make things better for containerization, but theres also a lot of shit they fucking wrecked
[04:08:24] <shakygator> docker hub *made it easy*
[04:08:36] <PattyCakes> idk mang, I'll stay in my lane - enjoy your VMs
[04:08:38] <PattyCakes> :P
[04:08:50] <Cl0udNinja> any time before a package management solution for a new tech is hard to enjoy shakygator lets be honest
[04:09:03] * Cl0udNinja has flashbacks of installing FC2 without yum support
[04:09:45] <PattyCakes> I'll give anyone this though, containers just for sake of containers is a dumb idea. If you con't provide a legit business case for upending your entire dev cycle
[04:10:16] <PattyCakes> but there are a ton of cases where cloud + containers makes a fuck ton of sense. Especially if you're already upgrading legacy code bases to bring them into "cloud rediness"
[04:10:20] <Cl0udNinja> PattyCakes, my current role is with a hardware-tied company, we do support VMs and cloud stuff, but its all very specifically related to storage stuff so you cant really containerize that kind of shit
[04:10:34] <shakygator> theyre so great for ephemeral workloads
[04:10:39] <Telgareith> yea
[04:10:42] <shakygator> and so much faster to scale than VMs
[04:10:50] <Telgareith> that's what I was promoting at work
[04:11:04] <Telgareith> and also work has issues with unapproved changes to the system
[04:11:17] <PattyCakes> containers make auditing changes a fucking BREEZE
[04:11:29] <Telgareith> with a deployment flow you can't make changes to the image in the middle of the cycle
[04:12:24] <Telgareith> also I'm too young for that eminimem song
[04:12:31] <PattyCakes> and yea Cl0udNinja, we're just in different industries
[04:12:33] <PattyCakes> both have their places
[04:12:40] <PattyCakes> I'm not coming for your job, and you're not coming for mine :P

[04:13:46] <PattyCakes> very much yiss
[04:14:03] <Cl0udNinja> I dont think my liver or sanity could handle being in container land all the time
[04:14:09] <Cl0udNinja> its bad enough having to do it as much as I do
[04:14:11] <PattyCakes> oh it's taken a TOLL on my liver
[04:14:15] <PattyCakes> you have to work with developers
[04:14:17] <PattyCakes> EVERY DAY
[04:14:35] <Cl0udNinja> already do that, but our devs are awesome
[04:14:41] <PattyCakes> ours....aren't
[04:14:51] <PattyCakes> that's a lie, we have some pretty good ones
[04:14:56] <PattyCakes> we just have a LOT of the bad ones too
[04:15:01] <shakygator> Cl0udNinja, you sound like you just need better tooling/framework to deal with it
[04:15:18] <xe0n> easier said than done
[04:15:29] <Cl0udNinja> PattyCakes, we're pretty open at work and people voice their opinions pretty easily, so if someone is about to make a bad decision others will provide better options
[04:15:33] <PattyCakes> ^
[04:15:36] <shakygator> i mean yeah, if you dont know what youre doing or dont have someone to show you the ropes
[04:16:10] <Cl0udNinja> shakygator, for the containers we do isnt really worth it, like the container I'm working now is migrating our wiki from an ancient system to a container so as not to fuck with any versions of anything else
[04:16:17] <Cl0udNinja> literally a one off, one time touching container process
[04:16:36] <PattyCakes> it ain't cheap either. As I said, we're 3 years into our cloud container effort
[04:17:04] <shakygator> but thats just a one off, we're talking building microservices and distributed systems on them
[04:17:12] <PattyCakes> it's an entire shift in company direction at the end of the day
[04:17:44] <Cl0udNinja> shakygator, yeah again different industries
[04:19:01] *** Quits: djhankb (~djhankb@208.113.164.68) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:19:30] <shakygator> definitely. we are building payment/onboarding systems and APIs on them
[04:19:36] <shakygator> but really anything can run on em now
[04:19:46] *** Joins: djhankb (~djhankb@208.113.164.68)
[04:20:33] <PattyCakes> Taking legacy datacenter SaaS apps and rewriting all the components into microservices
[04:20:36] <PattyCakes> that's what we're doing
[04:21:07] <PattyCakes> we hit our MVP for prod last year, I think we're officially deprecating legacy for new customers soon
[04:27:24] <shakygator> i honestly dont pay much attention to what we're actually building. it usually doesnt matter to me
[04:27:35] <shakygator> i only care as far as infra is related, what their APIs do dont interest me
[04:27:38] <PattyCakes> oh I have 0 clue how our platform works
[04:27:47] <Cl0udNinja> I like the stuff we build, play with it every day
[04:27:50] <shakygator> i have 2 guys on my team who are more release engs
[04:27:54] <shakygator> so they work with that
[04:27:58] <PattyCakes> health endpoint returning 200?
[04:28:00] <PattyCakes> cool, my job is done
[04:28:03] <shakygator> basically lol
[04:28:23] <PattyCakes> I mean, I run beta and prod releases
[04:28:30] <PattyCakes> but I'm just there incase one of my buttons explodes
[04:28:32] <PattyCakes> which is very rare
[04:28:33] <shakygator> im on the calls but i only exec things related to infra
[04:28:46] <shakygator> yeah i build pipelines to call my scripts so i just click run
[04:28:54] <PattyCakes> we manage the CI/CD part too
[04:29:00] <shakygator> and then i go smoke weed while listening to the rest
[04:29:01] <PattyCakes> for both our shit, and for product releases
[04:29:07] <PattyCakes> basically shakygator 
[04:29:33] <PattyCakes> I've had QA release managers ask me what X,Y,Z does
[04:29:38] <PattyCakes> IDFK YOU BUILT IT!
[04:29:54] <shakygator> like i manage an EKS cluster running jenkins and i own basically all of that for 4+ teams. my team is moving to gitlab though so we are gonna tell them to get bent cuz i spend too much time managing their shit
[04:30:40] <PattyCakes> same model just with a bit more application work
[04:30:42] <PattyCakes> on my end
[04:32:21] <shakygator> thats not even a real responsibility anymore, its just extra shit i have to do
[04:32:34] <shakygator> the other teams will call "join this call" "no"
[04:32:38] <shakygator> i dont work for you
[04:33:11] <PattyCakes> if I'm the on call, and a team bugs me - I'll entertain them for abotu 10 minutes
[04:33:24] <PattyCakes> mostly because we've scalded enough of them enough times that they know better now
[04:33:39] <Telgareith> PattyCakes: I'm hoping to get in as a QA Eng to a company (entry one of my resume ironically), learn their software, learn the ins and outs. Help Automate etc
[04:33:55] <PattyCakes> You are now my mortal enemy
[04:34:00] <Telgareith> LOL
[04:34:12] <PattyCakes> QA drives me insane
[04:34:18] <Telgareith> I don't mind it
[04:34:24] <Telgareith> I'm not some QA drone
[04:34:33] <shakygator> we are too big of a company, too many dumb people too
[04:34:49] <Telgareith> I learn EVERYTHING
[04:34:53] <PattyCakes> yea shakygator, not everyone gets access to the red button
[04:35:08] <Telgareith> I have forgotten more about the system at work than the people remaining know
[04:35:14] <PattyCakes> someone neesd to have been woken up or several people woken up before the DevOps button can be smashed
[04:35:34] <Telgareith> and I still know more than them, except I've been kept in a hole and fed shit for 10mo
[04:35:46] <xe0n> because its probably your attitude and the way you approach things
[04:35:52] <shakygator> the problem is my team, we built tools, then we shared those tools with other teams, then my SVP left, so we got fragmented, and then my boss left who is the only one who knows anything about this stuff. so now im stuck supporting other teams with stuff only i know
[04:36:03] <PattyCakes> ooof
[04:36:04] <PattyCakes> that's ruf
[04:36:24] <shakygator> and these other teams have VPs who think they are big time so they try to act like it
[04:36:38] <shakygator> but idgaf, esp in this labor market.
[04:36:45] <PattyCakes> RIGHT?!
[04:36:54] <PattyCakes> i give enough fucks to not be terrible at my job
[04:37:15] <shakygator> i dont work for them, so it really doesnt matter. and even if my boss/team wanted to fire me i could just go to any one of the other teams that needs me right now. or you know, just leave and double my pay
[04:37:19] <PattyCakes> we can discuss more labor after we discuss my inflation raise + merit bonus
[04:37:25] <Telgareith> xe0n: start as a nobody QA at new company, learn how to talk their lingo. Maybe find a few books on manipulating people
[04:37:36] <shakygator> QA is whack
[04:38:02] <shakygator> do you really wanna write use cases all day
[04:38:22] <Telgareith> uhm It's what I spend 2/3rds of my day doing anyway
[04:38:41] <e1> yo who was the loki pro
[04:38:43] <Telgareith> its just the flip side of the card
[04:39:03] <Telgareith> programmer tries to cover all the bases, QA tries to break the bases
[04:39:03] <e1> I'm writing a script to absolutely abuse tf out of loki with old data but I think it's not accepting anything older than what it has
[04:39:12] <e1> entry for stream '{foo="bar2"}' has timestamp too old: 2022-02-01 01:00:02.449 +0000 UTC
[04:39:35] <shakygator> idk much about QA except all the tools we provide them, like selenium
[04:39:48] <shakygator> sauce connect? is that one? i thought so
[04:39:51] <Telgareith> selenium so old :|
[04:40:01] <shakygator> ya well they are using it
[04:40:12] <Telgareith> I hope they've had a major update since i looked at it in 2015
[04:40:17] <shakygator> ill add it to our build images, but after that its on them

[10:54:18] <Hunterkll> ah right, it's probably direct delivery only too 
[10:54:24] <CableNinja> of course it is
[10:54:31] <Hunterkll> yea they require that
[10:54:31] <CableNinja> because its a restricted item
[10:54:39] <Hunterkll> *shrug* 
[10:54:48] <Hunterkll> gotta have someone over 21 at home at the time of delivery to accept the package
[10:54:52] <Hunterkll> that's all you can do
[10:55:01] <Hunterkll> actually, come to think of it, address on ID doesn't actually need to match either
[10:55:04] <yuken> CableNinja, it's not even an item that has heavy federal regulations.

[11:04:24] <CableNinja> bump that fucker up too
[11:04:56] <yuken> @cooleb09 Default GC in Java will let you just keep allocating memory until you hit your max, then try to clean everything up to your minimum.
[11:05:36] <yuken> Which means if your max memory is 16G, and your min is 256M, it will just keep going up and up and up... then try to clean up once you hit that max, all the way down to 256M (or until it runs out of stuff to GC).
[11:05:44] <yuken> Which means huge performance spikes if you don't set up your flags correctly.

[11:44:49] <Kiernian> oh, I agree, and I still think even wifi wireless printing is for the birds. I still have nightmares about the days I spent debugging an application server I built only to discover the issue was that the damned thing was doing exactly what it was supposed to and sending raw postscript plot jobs, it was just sending them to the plotter WIRELESSLY on 802.11b (BEFORE g) 
[11:45:11] <Kiernian> so if it dropped so much as a single packet on a two gig postscript job, the plotter would just spit an error page
[11:47:11] <Kiernian> i was setting up encoding/decoding captures on redmon ports to make sure there wasn't some kind of format conversion error. NOPE, just packet loss completely unrelated to anything the server was doing that I didn't know and couldn't do anything about remotely because they failed to mention "wireless"

[16:20:36] <estranger> don't forget to factor in electrical costs with old equipment
[16:20:59] <Lancehead> I know. I meant that as in cheap, xe0n
[16:21:11] <Lancehead> Yeah estranger, that might be a bit of an issue. Think my landlord might stop liking me lol 
[16:21:22] <xe0n> just turn it off when you're not using it..
[16:21:41] <Lancehead> I'd run some stuff on it I wanna have on most of the time

[16:23:20] <Lancehead> lol yup 
[16:23:35] <PattyCakes> I've kinda wanted to turn off my entire setup for a day and see how much power I'm actually using
[16:23:37] <PattyCakes> across the entire network
[16:23:41] <SirSceptalot> you don't happen to have a paranoid neighbour with more money than sense? "hey I have this anti-5G server but nowhere to put it, if you want I can set it up in your house"
[16:23:51] <Lancehead> loool
[16:23:53] <estranger> lol
[16:24:05] <estranger> PattyCakes get a kill a watt or two
[16:24:13] <PattyCakes> that's WAY too much work
[16:24:33] <estranger> haha
[16:24:47] <estranger> I don't even own a computer lol
[16:24:57] <DrZak> ?
[16:25:02] <PattyCakes> all mine is either media related or homeassistant related
[16:25:04] <estranger> well, I have one in my closet turned off and the wife's mba
[16:25:05] <DrZak> you are a sysadmin without own computer?
[16:25:07] <Lancehead> Tbh, I'm already running two gaming PCs most of the day; I doubt they'd complain if I add a small 1U server to that
[16:25:16] <Activ8> anti 5g, meh they said this shit about 1g, 2g, 3g, 4g and now they doing it with 5g they need to get a life n think how much money can be made.  It doesn't harm human health
[16:25:20] <Activ8> fucking idiots
[16:25:22] <PattyCakes> I don't own my own persaonl daily driver DrZak

[16:25:34] <PattyCakes> I have my work laptop, that's it
[16:25:36] <DrZak> tos ,admess
[16:25:36] <PattyCakes> I do everything on it
[16:25:39] <estranger> yeah
[16:25:40] <Lancehead> SirSceptalot: I have something funny to send you, how the heck do I DM people again
[16:25:40] <DrZak> tis madness
[16:25:42] <estranger> same
[16:25:54] <PattyCakes> I mean, it's a nice mac book
[16:25:56] <SirSceptalot> Activ8, they said the same thing about radio before that
[16:25:57] <SirSceptalot> and trains
[16:26:00] <estranger> I have a mbp 16 w a i9 for work and I just use that
[16:26:00] <PattyCakes> anything I'd buy wouldn't be this niec
[16:26:05] <PattyCakes> ^
[16:26:05] <estranger> and cloud accounts
[16:26:06] <Activ8> idiots honestly
[16:26:11] <Lancehead> Was it /msg query?
[16:26:13] <SirSceptalot> Lancehead, /msg nickname
[16:26:32] <PattyCakes> Activ8 in reference to me and estranger?
[16:26:57] <estranger> I'm an idiot, its true
[16:27:08] <PattyCakes> Professional Idiot 
[16:27:10] <PattyCakes> tyvm
[16:27:17] <estranger> lol
[16:27:34] <Activ8> no to the anti 5gers
[16:27:39] <estranger> it's my job to tell others they are idiots, in a politely manor
[16:28:01] <Activ8> would you mind sharing your secret message to call people idiots in a nice way
[16:28:03] <Activ8> lol
[16:28:12] <estranger> "sure you can do that... you will fail miserably, but you can do it"
[16:28:26] <Lancehead> SirSceptalot: I tend to use /query <nick> since it opens a new channel. Little easier to keep up with 
[16:29:55] <PattyCakes> Activ8 "Taking this route goes against my better judgement and runs afoul of best practices. That being said, if you wish to do it, here's how - LONG LIST OF MISERABLE THINGS - Oh and there's no guarantee it will work"
[16:30:12] <Activ8> :D
[16:30:41] <PattyCakes> Telling people "NO" works, but in my professional experience - A no without a plan just causes trouble for everyone
[16:31:04] <estranger> customer: "I blah blah blah blah then do blah blah blah" me: *turns on zoom camera 
[16:31:18] <estranger> .... stares directly at camera* "no."
[16:33:36] <riff-IRC> "Hey can we connect a 4160V to 13.8kV transformer and feed the power grid to make some money?"
[16:33:36] <riff-IRC> Me: "NO."
[16:33:56] <Lancehead> loool 
[16:34:56] <riff-IRC> The raw fuel cost would be more than the money you make from the power sold.
[16:35:33] <riff-IRC> Plus maintenance and the investment cost to properly set the electrical system up for such a thing.
[16:35:41] <SirSceptalot> hm
[16:35:42] <SirSceptalot> I wonder
[16:35:52] <Lancehead> Yep. Same mindset as people wanting to mine bitcoin and forgetting about power/equipment costs 
[16:36:06] <MOLNIJA> Awroaooao
[16:36:13] <MOLNIJA> Sup folks?
[16:36:16] <Activ8> people don't like hearing the word no
[16:36:18] <Lancehead> Hello dog person 
[16:36:18] <riff-IRC> And on top of that, you need to be moving real power instead of maintaining a standing wave on the tiebus.
[16:36:25] <hello> hello
[16:36:26] <Activ8> when people here this they tend to find someone who will say yes
[16:36:27] <MOLNIJA> Wolf*
[16:36:34] <Activ8> No No No No No No No No No No No No No No 
[16:36:39] <Activ8> Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes 
[16:36:43] <SirSceptalot> yep, they exist. Somehow riff-IRC's comments made me wonder if you can buy an exercise bike that generates power
[16:36:43] <Activ8> No No No No No No No No No No No No No No 
[16:36:45] <Activ8> Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes 
[16:36:45] <Activ8> No No No No No No No No No No No No No No 
[16:36:46] <SirSceptalot> then answer is yes
[16:36:46] <Activ8> Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

[16:38:06] <Hunterkll> or don't, so it confuses and dilutes their metrics even more
[16:38:37] <Lancehead> Activ8: I've found people hate the word "no" even more when it comes from an intern 
[16:38:48] <Lancehead> And then it usually turns into a "yes" and I do stupid shit for people 
[16:38:50] <riff-IRC> Pushing 2500MVA and actually moving 100W is such a massive waste of energy.
[16:39:08] <SirSceptalot> I don't quite remember what prompted this, but our company once made a hamster racing boat for a customer
[16:39:15] <riff-IRC> Pushing 2500MVA and actually moving 2MW is much more efficient.

[16:40:12] <SirSceptalot> but I imagine the hamster racing driver got laid often
[16:40:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[16:40:24] <estranger> you need to be a trusted advisor to say no, but saying no can get you to trusted advisor status... fun paradox
[16:40:42] <Lancehead> SirSceptalot: I'm on the verge of getting two rats, wanna build me a rat-sized one?

[16:45:33] <estranger> how long ago were you at rack space?
[16:45:47] <PattyCakes> coming up on 2 years
[16:46:30] <MOLNIJA> did RackSpace rent out rack space?
[16:46:43] <PattyCakes> at one point in their life they did
[16:46:49] <MOLNIJA> or are they cloud people

[16:47:35] <MOLNIJA> a

[16:50:28] <estranger> a lot of Cassandra people came from there

[18:18:04] <PublicWiFi> that sounds like teh ugliest thing ever
[18:18:14] <vinrock> yeah modern guage clusters are just screens
[18:18:20] <PublicWiFi> yeah and I don't like it
[18:18:34] <misspwn> so many cars were doin it so i told the audi dealership that if that wasn't going away in the 2022 model i aint interested and went and got a volvo s60
[18:18:36] <PublicWiFi> I want my car to be dumb as shit, guess I'm stuck driving pre 2010 vehicles lol
[18:18:39] <vinrock> my current car, the guage cluster is a screen, theres a bigass screen in the middle of the dash next to it, theres a little screen underneath for the HVAC and theres a heads-up display on the windshield
[18:19:07] <SirSceptalot> misspwn, the s90 is so dmn beautiful
[18:19:15] <vinrock> but every basic control that cars always come with have physical controls
[18:19:25] <misspwn> now i have heated seats which i am aware is standard in a lot of cars now days, but this car is so absolutely beautiful i love driving it. it's smooth/quite
[18:19:27] <misspwn> just makes me happy

[18:31:15] <fritzwastaken> thats why I use SSH to AWS
[18:31:39] <fritzwastaken> my last job had a website whitelist
[18:31:41] <fritzwastaken> it was insane
[18:31:51] <PublicWiFi> lancehead: isn't that an open world space (open space?) game?
[18:31:51] <sintax> vinrock: let's join up! im gonna too
[18:31:53] <fritzwastaken> they had different tiers of content management based on your role and what sites you could visit
[18:31:57] <lancehead> fritzwastaken: it's a pretty good game. VERY detailed. devs are shit at listening to people though
[18:32:04] <vinrock> fuck yea if its multiplayer im down
[18:32:06] <fritzwastaken> that was a huge kickstarter game right?
[18:32:14] <lancehead> Nah that's Star Citizen
[18:32:18] <vinrock> nah its Bethesda's upcoming gigantic Space RPG
[18:32:18] <fritzwastaken> ahhh yea
[18:32:27] <vinrock> release date in 11/22
[18:32:39] <fritzwastaken> more than likely 11/24
[18:32:48] <vinrock> possibly
[18:32:53] <lancehead> PublicWiFi: It is yes, and they have a scale model (procedurally generated) of our ENTIRE UNIVERSE. 1.1 billion star systems you can physically fly into 
[18:32:54] <vinrock> i might be able to score an xbox by then 
[18:33:03] <PublicWiFi> oh christ
[18:33:05] <lancehead> And their lead dev has a PhD in astrophysics so it's all scientifically accurate
[18:33:12] <PublicWiFi> my nipples can only get so erect
[18:33:44] * SirSceptalot perks up again
[18:33:46] <fritzwastaken> Anyone need some glass cut
[18:33:48] <SirSceptalot> you had me at nipples
[18:33:50] <lancehead> And a background simulation for inhabited systems, so they can go into different states (war, economic decline, pirate takeover) which determines the activities/factions
[18:33:53] <PublicWiFi> SirSceptalot: :3
[18:34:01] <lancehead> And trade prices 
[18:34:04] <lancehead> It's so stupidly detailed 
[18:34:21] <PublicWiFi> its not detailed to the point where the learning curve is a vertical line is it?
[18:34:21] <SirSceptalot> is that elite dangerous you're talking about? I'm really not up to speed with games anymore
[18:34:22] <PublicWiFi> lol
[18:34:29] <lancehead> Yeah SirSceptalot
[18:34:33] <SirSceptalot> PublicWiFi, learning wall

[18:34:49] <lancehead> Somewhat PublicWiFi, but even without learning everything it's still fun to just fly the starter toaster ship around

[18:36:51] <PublicWiFi> and can't play grindy games anymore :(
[18:37:09] <lancehead> Which means learning about engineers, gathering mats which takes really long, then buying shit from the engineers to raise your level with them and learn about more engineers

[18:37:27] <sintax> got ya
[18:38:09] <lancehead> PublicWiFi: also the ship scale is hilarious. I fly a combat ship that's the size of like eight soccer fields irl full of guns
[18:38:26] <sintax> lol
[18:38:47] <PublicWiFi> lol!
[18:38:57] <PublicWiFi> now if it had like.. boarding parties and pirates
[18:38:58] <monr0e> And that ship that is the size of several football fields can be easily defeated by a ship the size of a large heavy goods vehicle
[18:39:00] <PublicWiFi> I would prolly nut

[18:41:09] <monr0e> Yeah I haven't played properly in a while, odyssey kinda ruined it for me
[18:41:39] <lancehead> Yeah, that happened with a lot of people when it launched. It's a lot better now though
[18:41:50] <lancehead> They've done like 10 large updates to it. I actually get 60fps planetside now :^)
[18:41:55] <monr0e> All the pvp events stil seem to happen in horizons, but it just doesn't have the appeal rn
[18:42:28] <lancehead> I feel ya. I'd probably play star citizen more if my rig could handle it
[18:42:38] <monr0e> I still haven't bought odyssey, can't justify it. There are so many broken things in this game, and the glassdoor reviews demonstrate a bit of churn
[18:42:52] <fritzwastaken> I got a semi mechanical keyboard with no num pad and im fuckin loving it
[18:42:54] <monr0e> Un-nerf the python plskthx

[18:43:46] <monr0e> also it looks like it has a birth defect
[18:44:03] <monr0e> why the fuck would you mount the rear engines there
[18:44:03] <lancehead> My ship does "bzzzzt - pew!" and people are dead in one strafe. It's great 
[18:44:14] <vinrock> star citizen looks amazing and i hope it eventually becomes a game
[18:44:18] <monr0e> pfff. 1v1 me in my python
[18:44:32] <lancehead> It's pretty good as is, vinrock. I just wish they'd optimize it better

[18:44:38] <lancehead> Yeah PublicWiFi
[18:44:41] <monr0e> I have rinzler070707's chieftain build adapted for the python, it is mean af
[18:44:42] <PublicWiFi> that looks dope!
[18:44:47] <vinrock> seems like right now its more open world exploration with no real purpose
[18:44:53] <vinrock> i want a storyline and missions
[18:45:04] <lancehead> There are missions tbf but no real storyline or something
[18:45:08] <vinrock> ah
[18:45:09] <PublicWiFi> ah
[18:45:14] <PublicWiFi> yeah I'm with vinrock on this one
[18:45:16] <monr0e> Sounds like elite dangerous
[18:45:33] <lancehead> At least elite has in-game news and stuff that influence the game
[18:45:39] <monr0e> HAH
[18:45:50] <lancehead> there's no voice acted stuff, but if the news says thargoids are attacking brestla, then thargoids are attacking brestla
[18:45:51] <monr0e> Not really
[18:45:59] <vinrock> like, eve was just this open world where you did whatever you want but it had a pretty awesome story behind it and that was a big part of getting sucked in
[18:46:03] <monr0e> Well, yes thargoids, but its all predetermined
[18:46:19] <lancehead> true monr03, but they utilize it enough for it to be interesting imo 
[18:46:29] <lancehead> star citizen is just grab mission - go here - shoot person - dollars
[18:46:34] <PublicWiFi> eve just took so much time...
[18:46:35] <monr0e> Yes. vinrock has it. Eve has a  *player oriented scriptline*
[18:46:37] <PublicWiFi> so.. much.. time
[18:46:47] <vinrock> monr0e did you play
[18:46:58] <monr0e> Yep. I was in RIGID back in the day
[18:47:03] <fritzwastaken> Hunterkll is an eve nerd
[18:47:05] <lancehead> Also monr0e, I will 1v1 you. I fly entirely FA/off, are you scared yet 
[18:47:09] <monr0e> had a spell in brave after that
[18:47:10] <vinrock> im a goon, i started in 2009 at the end of the great war
[18:47:11] <fritzwastaken> He only has 18000 hours in it
[18:47:17] <vinrock> played for like 10 years
[18:48:17] <monr0e> lancehead: nope. I wiped the floor with neo not too long ago
[18:48:24] <monr0e> fa-off is my default
[18:48:33] <lancehead> dangit, that scares most people 
[18:48:41] <lancehead> now I'm scared
[18:48:52] <monr0e> I've played Eve since 2005ish
[18:49:09] <monr0e> but I haven't much touched it over the past few years
[18:49:18] <vinrock> oh wow
[18:49:30] <vinrock> so you havent played with the updated graphics n shit that came with Apocrypha
[18:49:57] <monr0e> I played it a couple months ago, but tbh I'd need a side-by-side comparison
[18:50:13] <fritzwastaken> ugh please dont mention updated graphics
[18:50:16] <lancehead> monr0e: Last CG was conflict zones, I at some point entered one and there was a ganker flying around in an FDL. I said "leave or I'll turn my FA off"
[18:50:18] <fritzwastaken> I need a new graphics card so bad
[18:50:18] <vinrock> i stopped playing after they made it possible to buy training
[18:50:19] <lancehead> It didn't work 
[18:50:30] <fritzwastaken> im terrified of having to spend like 600$ to get a decent video card

[18:50:43] <vinrock> fritz im just waiting for the 4000 series

[18:54:18] <monr0e> I could never get hte hang of ltd mining. I stuck to strip mining
[18:54:29] <monr0e> the painite era
[18:54:34] <fritzwastaken> Plug and PLay is such a weird game
[18:54:40] <lancehead> anaconda with mining gear and two 64U cargo holds full of limpets = 200m/h
[18:54:45] <vinrock> that was a good thing about eve
[18:54:51] <vinrock> you could mine while you were at work
[18:55:00] <vinrock> since its just point and click it took like zero effort
[18:55:12] <lancehead> Core mining in elite is HARD man 
[18:55:22] <monr0e> I have a mining type 9, it is an absolute bear to fly
[18:55:58] <lancehead> You have to find the right rock with a good yield (which can take like 30 minutes), then scan it for fissures, then launch enough explosives into it to get a perfect yield
[18:56:06] <lancehead> If you launch too many you have to scramble to turn some off 
[18:56:12] <monr0e> yeah finding rocks was the part I had trouble with
[18:56:23] <lancehead> Pro tip if you wanna try again: turn on night vision 
[18:56:27] <lancehead> Makes em glow brighter
[18:56:33] <monr0e> urgh
[18:56:35] <monr0e> never again
[18:57:03] <lancehead> But yeah one rock can take like 20-30 minutes to find. Every rock is worth ~20m though so it's not too bad

[19:13:23] <lancehead> I have a 550Ti in a box somewhere 
[19:13:29] <vinrock> the new intel and amd architecture is arriving, new nvidia ada lovelace gpus, DDR5 and PCIE 5.0
[19:13:30] <fritzwastaken> ive always been years behind because I hate spending money on video cards

[19:22:56] <lancehead> Although it's fucking weird to do so; 4gb out of that 8 is soldered and they allow up to an extra 16
[19:23:01] <lancehead> which means I'd end up with 20GB...

[19:26:30] <lancehead> I bought a caddy that didn't fit, ripped out the board, glued it to the fake optical drive and screwed an extra SSD into it

[20:57:09] <javi404_> honest question, where did the term "do the needful" come from and why is it so popular with our friends on the other side of the planet?
[20:58:48] <koollman> javi404_: it comes from a country that used it for a while and kind of spread its language and culture around
[21:00:11] <vinrock> "But here’s a more important question: Why, in the year 2021, are we all scrambling once a month, racing against the clock, to update as much as possible as fast as possible? "

I've already got a CA.crt on the remote device, so I'd really like to just update the sshd file and mail it out. Then, I can generate my client cert (and sign it with the CA) at a later time.

[23:06:49] <PublicWiFi> the firewall is used for some light duty stuff, I thought about just moving that WAN over to our main firewall/router but the WANs are both in the same subnet and I haven't sit down long enough to figure out how to get it to work in sonicwall
[23:09:24] <vinrock> if a sonicwall is like other firewalls im used to couldnt you just have two ports configured as external interfaces on the same subnet?
[23:09:44] <PattyCakes>   <PublicWiFi> guess I could always add teh external ground cable - sir any grounded outlet should goto the ground cable
[23:12:05] <PublicWiFi> yes
[23:12:11] <PublicWiFi> but extra ground means extra better right
[23:14:08] <PublicWiFi> PattyCakes: these units have external ground pounds for their cases
[23:14:16] <DomLS3> PublicWiFi: whats your sonicwall problem?
[23:14:18] <PublicWiFi> points*
[23:14:29] <PublicWiFi> DomLS3: nvm on that :D
[23:14:39] <DomLS3> Two WAN addresses in the same subnet? Both WANs can be assigned to different ports
[23:14:44] <DomLS3> doesnt matter if they are in the same subnet
[23:14:44] <DomLS3> oh ok
[23:14:46] <PublicWiFi> nop
[23:14:48] <PublicWiFi> yes it does
[23:14:53] <PublicWiFi> sonicwall wont let you
[23:15:02] <PublicWiFi> if they are same subnet and have same gateway
[23:15:05] *** Joins: A-KO (A-KO@user/a-ko)
[23:15:09] <DomLS3> oh same gateway
[23:15:12] <PublicWiFi> you gotta do nat trickery
[23:15:12] <DomLS3> hmm
[23:15:25] <DomLS3> why would you have two wans in the same subnet anyway?
[23:15:26] <PublicWiFi> but im not gonna do that, I'd like to keep the 2 WAN's airgapped
[23:15:35] <PublicWiFi> AT&T gave us a block lol
[23:15:38] <DomLS3> generally you would do that with two separate internet connections
[23:15:50] <PublicWiFi> well its meant to be totally airgapped anyways
[23:16:17] <DomLS3> well yeah you can have a block of 10 IPs you can use externally but you're supposed to only use one for your WAN port and the others for NAT translation rules to assign those IPs to externally accessible machines
[23:16:29] <PublicWiFi> tldr I have a weird ass issue with a fortigate completely dropping alL VPN connections randomly
[23:16:36] <DomLS3> using two WAN ips doesnt make sense because it's the same ISP
[23:16:48] <PublicWiFi> I happen to notice this also happens when one of my UPS's kicks to battery power, even though the fortigate isn't connected to that UPS
[23:17:07] <DomLS3> yeah get rid of the fortigate and go sonicwall
[23:17:13] <DomLS3> so simple. Cheap. It just works
[23:17:21] <PublicWiFi> I'm pretty sure i'm gonna pop pfsense in here and see what happens
[23:17:32] <PublicWiFi> if it fucks up again then I know it has to be the AT&T cisco router
[23:18:02] <PublicWiFi> whats weird is we have both of those WANs over 1 circuit ofc, and the other WAN has no problems
[23:18:07] <PublicWiFi> its a big fucked up mess lol
[23:18:15] <vinrock> lol holy fuck 
[23:18:34] <vinrock> that dude that beheaded a guy on a geryhound bus and ate his fuckin heart a few years back was released without supervision years ago
[23:18:35] <DomLS3> bruh
[23:18:35] <PublicWiFi> we even moved the ports arond on the router with no luck
[23:18:42] <PublicWiFi> vinrock: christ
[23:18:46] <vinrock> wtf
[23:18:51] <DomLS3> vinrock: and people are in jail doing life for weed
