[01:15:56] <SnoopJ> kevr, looks like you can set `reportFunctionMemberAccess` to control this behavior in pyright. Not sure if there's a way to do that for a single function, though?

I want to implement kinda of pretty print to the repr so I write own __repr__ for them, B&C add some information on top of the A.__repr__, what will be the way to plan this? To use this method: https://bpa.st/RPKQ or to override the entire repr for each derived class?

[06:27:50] <jiffe> so I'm trying to use pyenv to install python 3.9.6, this system doesn't have openssl installed but I installed libssl 1.1 and headers into ~/.local and set CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly, but the build still fails due to not being able to find libssl, am I missing something?

[06:38:07] <rjwiii> Ok ... I'm writing a script to compare 2M+ csv records against a list of 7M+ elements. I'm using a generator to read the csv file and the list is in memory. Is there any way to speed this up? Should I use 2 generators in a double nested loop?

[06:39:08] <grym> rjwiii: which kind of comparison(s)? for existence-heavy checks, a set is substantially faster

[06:48:15] <rjwiii> euouae: the csv file has 5 fields in each row. I'm comparing the first field against the list. if it's a match, I write the line to an open file with a 6 field of YES or NO ...

[11:53:42] <nubonix> iflfema hyphens are not equal to dashes

[11:54:22] <jinsun> although in module names it discourages underscores too https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names
[11:54:24] <no_gravity> jinsun: Yes, for the class name. My question was about the file name.
[11:54:56] <nubonix> but yeah, id adhere to pep8, just because python can understand your code, doesnt mean some else can [makes it super difficult to read if you are used to pep8]
[11:55:04] <no_gravity> PEP8 seems to not say anything about file names.
[11:55:14] <jinsun> no_gravity: well your file is a module, so follow module convention
[11:55:22] <no_gravity> The term "file name" does not even appear on https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
[11:55:38] <no_gravity> jinsun: There is a "module convention" for naming files?
[11:56:21] <nubonix> no_gravity pre sure underscores are used by the majority for filenames, makes me wonder why if there isnt a pep8 for that
[11:56:29] <no_gravity> jinsun: Ah yes, since the file name is the module name, I guess so.
[11:56:32] <jinsun> no_gravity: there is a "Package and Module Names" section on that page

[11:58:11] <no_gravity> Very interesting. Since that is so different from the PHP world. Where it would be called "StreetCleaner.php".

[12:03:03] <no_gravity> I think the reason is that PHP has no import system. So "include ('street_cleaning.php')" does not indicate what is inside that file. While in Python "from street_cleaning import StreetCleaner" does.
[12:03:35] <no_gravity> So in PHP to indicate what is actually "imported", it has to signal that via the file name.

[15:06:26] <Samian> actually a2d is a list of numpy arrays. and b1d is a numpy array

[17:09:11] <bjs> rendar: the first part (the actual import of the module) should work fine,  but if the import is circular the code might not have got to the `class Line` part of line.py yet so the `Line` class might not exist yet

[18:42:50] <Samian> bluss  I'm working with this library called fbgemm_gpu (https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/tree/master/fbgemm_gpu).  It builds to an egg-link file that points to the directory where I cloned the repo, and it build a file "fbgemm_gpu_py.so".. This file needs to be manually copied to the working directory of my python project.  It's annoying. And this egg-linker file + fbgemm_gpu_py.so file I need to manually copy around isn't the way python
[18:42:51] <Samian>  packages are supposed to be, not good ones at least.
[18:43:00] <amogorkon> jabberwock, we do have a config

[19:54:56] <__that__> It cannot be either the other end as the thread is as quick and put the end under as much pressure as the asynchronous code with no problems or wthatsoever

[20:04:46] <han-solo> not a list, so you can call `list` on it, to get a list

The Async fails all the time with the Timeout error shown there https://dpaste.com/FUF9NPAXR. I have increased the tiemeout bot at session level and at each individual request with the same result.

[21:41:05] <dev-pep> Hi everyone. I have some difficulties understanding a few things from the C API. From "Extending and Embedding Python", section "2.1.2 Intermezzo: Errors and Exceptions", you can read: The most general function is PyErr_SetObject(), which takes two object arguments, the exception and its associated value. You don’t need to Py_INCREF() the objects
[21:41:05] <dev-pep> passed to any of these functions. I don't fully get it: does it simply mean that the reference to the exception object will be borrowed by PyErr_SetObject()? Or there's more to it?

[23:30:00] <SnoopJ> seanicus, I think lxml's iterparse provides the event information you'd need to keep track of a "location", but I don't know if anything in the library really provides that functionality
[23:30:24] <Linkandzelda> this is a funny question but im using pytube and the register_on_progress_callback function. im wondering if there's any way i can stop the download process from within this function. it uses request.stream in its own code, but i have no access to terminate the process. can i inject a fake http error to force it to stop?
[23:30:24] <seanicus> SnoopJ: darn.

[23:32:12] <SnoopJ> I think those samples are just showing each event, but it wouldn't be *too* bad to keep track of a history, I think?
[23:32:34] <SnoopJ> maybe a subclass that modifies its own state based on the events emitted by the base

[23:33:21] <seanicus> the events look like just the parser coming across the beginning and end of an element?

[23:33:48] <SnoopJ> and namespace changes
[23:33:49] <seanicus> Thank you, I'll look into it
[23:34:04] <seanicus> I'm not really sure what a namespace is in regards to xml but I don't think it's relevant to my needs.
[23:34:15] <bjs> habnabit_: and with type hinting becoming more common these kind of mutual import things are more common too
[23:34:35] <bjs> there are many things I'd change about Python's import system,  it's kind of a mess
[23:34:55] <SnoopJ> seanicus, it's pretty much the same thing it means in programming languages that have them: a <tag> may exist in multiple specifications, with slightly different semantics. Namespaces let you avoid a clash.
[23:35:09] <SnoopJ> but if you don't know about them you're probably fine pretending they don't exist :)
[23:35:12] <bjs> it's one of the areas of the language (if the stack of the import system can really be considered part of the language) that I am least confident on
[23:35:18] <bjs> so many edge cases for everything
[23:35:23] <lmmx> bjs I renamed the foo and bar to Session and Response so it's a bit clearer which is the "parent", and used an intermediate module `request_handling` to import both the modules, but still get the circular import error
[23:35:23] <SnoopJ> lxml's iterative parsing is great, so that's definitely where I'd start if nothing leaps out as obviously what you want from browsing PyPI
[23:35:24] <lmmx> https://bpa.st/BN6A
[23:35:30] <habnabit_> bjs, ha ha no you just put those imports behind an `if TYPE_HINTING:` block and that fixes everything for terrible reasons
