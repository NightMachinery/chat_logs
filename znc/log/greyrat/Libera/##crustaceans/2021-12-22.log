[00:45:35] <manicennui> They can find another game that people love and buy the company and ruin it.

[18:40:36] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: 4k display running at pixel-doubled 1080p is my favorite programming environment, text is so sharp
[18:40:53] <dimadima> what do you mean prussian
[18:41:03] <dimadima> gwozniak: why do you like the mbp
[18:41:24] <dimadima> i'm fine with the mbp for programming, but i've always been more or less fine w/ widescreen programming
[18:46:07] <gwozniak> dimadima: the display is pretty crisp and it helps that macOS can scale things well
[18:49:24] <gwozniak> There's no question the MBPro display is better than my ThinkPad's
[18:50:21] <ngoldbaum> i got my first mbp with a retina display in like 2013? definitely can’t ever go back to a low pixel density screen
[18:50:45] <ngoldbaum> especially low pixel density laptop displays look like garbage to me
[18:50:46] <ngoldbaum> now
[18:51:28] <companion_cube> how dense is your thinkpad's screen?
[18:53:06] <indigo> I’m fine with my 1440p screen :P
[18:53:12] <gwozniak> I have to look this up. I never know the numbers, I just know it looks less good
[18:53:30] <dimadima> once i went high density, i couldn't go back
[18:54:10] <indigo> I go back and forth
[18:54:16] <companion_cube> or the resolution if you want
[18:54:23] <indigo> It’s just a screen to me
[18:54:34] <companion_cube> my thinkpad is 1920x and I think it's plenty enough
[18:55:40] * ngoldbaum wants crisp fonts
[18:55:44] <ngoldbaum> cwispie fonts
[18:56:52] <gwozniak> 1920x1080 on a 14" display
[18:57:50] <gwozniak> Maybe the display is fine and Windows just can't draw things nice.  At any rate, reading on the mbpro is nicer
[18:57:59] <gwozniak> Not that the thinkpad is awful, mind you
[18:58:20] <gwozniak> But the fonts in the terminal look... not as good

[20:09:05] <manicennui> Why is it so satisfying to expel things from our bodies?
[20:11:05] <imode> kinky.

[20:15:01] <manicennui> I blew my nose and got a pleasant surprise.

[21:40:21] <Brekkjern> Bleh. Figuring out what to watch can be a chore sometimes...
[21:41:22] <manicennui> I think I'm just tired of watching stuff.
[21:41:42] <Brekkjern> I'm tired of watching shit stuff
[21:42:31] <riv> it honestly is so much work
[21:42:39] <manicennui> I watch more YT than anything these days. I'm usually watching people do things that I'd like to be doing if I weren't so damn lazy.
[21:42:47] <riv> me too, I watch way too much YT actually
[21:42:54] <riv> hah
[21:43:00] <Brekkjern> Same
[21:43:01] <riv> i hope you can find the energy to do some of these things
[21:45:25] <Brekkjern> I feel like I ruined this entire quarter of the year by watching Arcane. I don't feel like anything really compares...
[21:45:34] <imode> anybody seen the matrix movie yet.
[21:45:40] <Brekkjern> Nope
[21:45:42] <gwozniak> Not yet
[21:45:47] <imode> I'm about to strap in for it.
[21:45:59] <gwozniak> I want to, but it seems to only be in theatres and I'm not keen on going out
[21:46:01] <kline> >girvan
[21:46:04] <kline> thats not far from here
[21:46:09] <manicennui> gwozniak: On HBO
[21:46:10] <imode> gwozniak: you can watch it on HBO Max.
[21:46:12] <manicennui> At least in the US
[21:46:13] <kline> maybe i can go look at once
[21:46:15] <kline> one
[21:46:22] <gwozniak> This assuming I can get HBO Max here
[21:46:26] <imode> ah, true. just pirate it.
[21:46:31] <imode> in true matrix fashion.
[21:46:58] <manicennui> What were the CDs that Neo was making at the beginning of the first movie?
[21:47:39] <imode> probably malware or pirated software.
[21:47:51] <manicennui> https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/27265
[21:47:52] <buttsbot> the matrix - What was Mr. Anderson (Neo) selling on discs to Choi? - Science Fiction & Fantasy Stack Exchange
[21:48:45] <imode> this already sucks.
[21:52:25] <manicennui> In the new movie, Neo exploits log4j to steal bitcoin.
[21:52:42] <imode> that would be more entertaining than whatever this introduction is.
[21:54:22] <manicennui> I mean, the new movie is pretty obviously a cash grab.
[21:54:30] <manicennui> At best it will be watchable.
[21:55:20] <imode> the acting is already subpar.
[21:55:36] <imode> over-emphasizing technical jargon, that stupid lilt when someone's reciting lines.
[21:55:40] <manicennui> Even for Keanu?
[21:55:46] <imode> keanu isn't in the intro.
[21:55:52] <manicennui> Ah.
[21:56:07] <imode> it's some blue-haired chick.
[21:56:28] <manicennui> That's how you know she is a l33t hacker.
[21:58:47] <imode> these two can't act.
[22:00:59] <imode> the pacing went out the window.
[22:01:01] *** Parts: riv (river@tilde.team/user/river) (WeeChat 3.3)
[22:02:17] <Brekkjern> Kinda felt that way watching one of the trailers
[22:03:02] <imode> are you fu-
[22:05:39] <imode> I can't discern whether this is clever satire, a fan film or someone legitimately thought this was a solid idea.
[22:05:59] <manicennui> They thought it would make money. The rest doesn't matter to the studios.
[22:06:31] <imode> this feels like a parody.
[22:07:09] <imode> this has to be a parody.
[22:08:09] <indigo> Wait you can already watch the matrix movie???
[22:08:11] <gwozniak> I've heard it will be divisive, but I've also heard favourable reviews
[22:09:34] <imode> indigo: yes.
[22:09:43] <indigo> Neat. We might watch it tonight then
[22:11:22] <imode> gwozniak: the favorable ones are more than likely paid.
[22:11:27] <imode> 20 minutes in.
[22:11:42] <gwozniak> Well, they were film critics, so yes, they get paid
[22:12:12] <imode> this is a two hour movie?!
[22:12:48] <gwozniak> And having read many reviews from one critic I saw who gave it a good review, I'm pretty sure that person is not paid by the studios
[22:13:23] <imode> money talks.
[22:17:57] <manicennui> " some hardcore fans of some artists will set up bot accounts on Spotify and have them listen to their favourite artist 24/7 to increase the streams/sales of that artist"
[22:17:58] <dminkovsky> it swears
[22:17:59] <manicennui> Really?
[22:18:29] <imode> manicennui: tbf apart from forcing spotify to pay its artists more, that's about what you can do.
[22:19:00] <manicennui> The implication in this discussion is that they are doing it for big artists though.
[22:19:07] <manicennui> Those people make plenty.
[22:19:13] <imode> bah.
[22:19:16] <imode> yeah.
[22:19:24] <manicennui> And how many bots and Spotify accounts would you need to make a dent in the numbers?
[22:19:32] <imode> also, just a word of warning before any of you stumble into the new matrix movie: they actively mock you.
[22:19:58] <manicennui> My friend wants to get together and get really drunk/high and watch it.
[22:20:13] <imode> just watch the first one again.
[22:20:43] <manicennui> We would be watching it in his living room on HBO.
[22:21:01] <imode> unless you're doing shrooms.
[22:21:10] <manicennui> I tend to remember even less about movies when I'm drunk.
[22:21:17] <manicennui> Although I doubt I would actually get drunk.
[22:21:53] <imode> take a shot every time they self-reference.
[22:22:05] <imode> or try to do some stupid comedic bit.
[22:22:11] <imode> you'll be dead in 20 minutes.
[22:22:29] <manicennui> I have another friend who moved away who used to do movie nights and it was mostly making jokes and talking over the movie.
[22:22:35] <manicennui> He was also a MST3K fan.
[22:22:35] <gwozniak> Given your hatred of it, I'm looking forward to watching it now
[22:22:53] <imode> gwozniak: either I'm a canary or I'm waiting for a payoff that I'll get further in.
[22:23:09] <imode> I don't like what I'm seeing.
[22:23:22] <manicennui> I don't know enough about imode's movie tastes to know what his opinion of this movie means, but I don't expect much from it.
[22:23:33] <imode> manicennui: if you've seen the movie already, IMO, that's a good way to spend an evening.
[22:24:02] <gwozniak> Anyone expecting the original Matrix kind of experience again is probably just setting themselves up for disappointment
[22:24:21] <manicennui> gwozniak: Definitely don't expect that. They didn't even manage that with the two existing sequels.
[22:24:22] <imode> I don't expect the original but I expected more effort.
[22:24:27] <gwozniak> Honestly, the first one is hyped too much anyway.  I like it, but it was not a transformative experience for me
[22:24:33] <manicennui> I expect even less now because it seems like an obvious cash grab.
[22:24:41] <manicennui> gwozniak: It was for me.
[22:24:45] <imode> the OG set up an aesthetic.
[22:24:49] <gwozniak> The first sequel was okay.  The second was not.
[22:24:52] <manicennui> gwozniak: But the details of the plot are kind of dumb if you think about it too much.
[22:25:02] <imode> like, if you wanna see "peak matrix", go watch the animatrix.
[22:25:04] <manicennui> It was originally different, but test audiences were too dumb to get it.
[22:25:12] <gwozniak> animatrix was also overrated, imo
[22:25:16] <manicennui> Animatrix was good too.
[22:25:21] <gwozniak> It was fine, tho
[22:25:24] <manicennui> Way better than the sequels.
[22:25:40] <imode> gwozniak: what matrix wasn't overrated.
[22:25:42] <gwozniak> Too many people expecting their cyberpunk reality to happen
[22:25:43] <dminkovsky> no matter the youtube video, if you wait 2 months, it'll be gone
[22:25:51] <manicennui> gwozniak: I don't expect that.
[22:26:10] <imode> there was a general aesthetic behind the series that died with the jesus metaphor.
[22:26:16] <manicennui> I didn't take any of it as a serious commentary or prediction of anything.
[22:26:27] <manicennui> Other than the general feeling of dread in the corporate environment.
[22:26:32] <manicennui> That is real.
[22:26:37] <gwozniak> The Matrix was a good movie, despite the fact people read way too much into it
[22:26:50] <imode> matrix numero uno and the animatrix were my only two solid entries.
[22:27:05] <imode> gwozniak: there is literally a scene in this movie that mocks you for doing that.
[22:27:07] <manicennui> I don't read anything into it. I like the fight choreography, visual design, etc.
[22:27:08] <imode> so you'd love this cash grab.
[22:27:16] <gwozniak> imode: good!
[22:27:28] <manicennui> And the sci-fi aspects are interesting enough to make it enjoyable while also being dumb.
[22:27:37] <gwozniak> Those reading too much into it should be mocked (a bit)
[22:27:38] <manicennui> I hated the sequels though.
[22:28:02] <imode> I don't think the matrix is cyberpunk.
[22:28:04] <gwozniak> The second one was watchable.  The third was a mess
[22:28:05] <manicennui> gwozniak: All geeks who think cyberpunk is a good thing should be mocked.
[22:28:19] <imode> technological escapism, yes, but not cyberpunk.
[22:28:24] <imode> that's the aesthetic I dig from it.
[22:28:33] <imode> this ain't that. at least, not yet.
[22:29:17] <imode> I should get drunk for this.
[22:30:14] <manicennui> Yes, you should always get drunk for IRC.
[22:30:23] <bkero> Sober? On IRC?

[22:40:45] <manicennui> Why?
[22:43:58] <imode> keanu can't act.
[22:45:15] <imode> eh maybe I'm wrong on that.
[22:45:23] <imode> it's starting to be alright.
[22:45:29] <companion_cube> he wanted you to believe that
[22:45:33] <companion_cube> what an act!
[22:46:39] <manicennui> No, he can't act.
[22:46:51] <manicennui> But his personality works well for some roles.
[22:47:04] <manicennui> And he seems to put a lot of work into being good at the action stuff.
[22:47:49] <dminkovsky> manicennui: the most per capita celeb sighting opportunities outside jackson hole
[22:48:07] <manicennui> dminkovsky: Is that a good thing?
[22:49:22] <imode> they could've called "hack" "bridge".
[22:49:24] <dminkovsky> i've never thought about that
[22:49:53] <dminkovsky> i just take celebs as a good thing
[22:49:57] <dminkovsky> and want to see them
[22:50:19] <dminkovsky> i'm basically lucy ricardo
[22:50:21] <manicennui> Why?
[22:50:51] <dminkovsky> because who wouldn't want clark gable's autograph?
[22:50:53] <manicennui> I truly don't understand wanting to see and talk to celebs and get their autographs.
[22:50:58] <dminkovsky> lol
[22:50:58] <manicennui> Me.
[22:51:20] <dminkovsky> well manicennui i am just burning logs here cause i am just kidding
[22:51:25] <manicennui> I rather see thoughtful celebs interviewed by good interviewers.
[22:51:39] <manicennui> Which is rare.
[22:51:53] <dminkovsky> plenty of celebs in new york too
[22:52:01] <manicennui> Celebrity interviews are typically a step above sportsball player interviews.
[22:52:14] <imode> well that's a fucking twist.
[22:52:16] <dminkovsky> i've seen a couple my self actually. saw maggie gyllenhal for example
[22:52:45] <dminkovsky> saw some i didn't know or recognize but people told me i saw them
[22:52:51] <dminkovsky> god sportsball
[22:53:12] <dminkovsky> every time i find out someone is a sports fan i literally get disappointed
[22:53:15] <dminkovsky> which is pretty unfair on my part
[22:53:29] <dminkovsky> but i can't imagine being interested in grownups playing a game for money
[22:53:33] <dminkovsky> does not compute
[22:53:55] <dminkovsky> and not just any game, but the same exact game, over and over and over and over
[22:54:11] <manicennui> I get maybe watching a game once in a while.
[22:54:25] <dminkovsky> i can't, i'm done
[22:54:34] <manicennui> I don't understand the obsession and somehow identifying as part of a group because you watch them.
[22:54:37] <dminkovsky> i have at various periods of my life, followed this or that
[22:54:45] <dminkovsky> yes it's _insane_
[22:54:47] <manicennui> I do enjoy watching fights sometimes.
[22:55:04] <manicennui> But I'm usually fine with the highlights of good fights.
[22:55:06] <dminkovsky> oh god i can't watch fights
[22:55:15] <companion_cube> what kind of fight manicennui ?
[22:55:17] <manicennui> Don't want to see boxers leaning on each other for multiple rounds.
[22:55:17] <dminkovsky> although i was forced to watch an MMA the other month and it was kind of incredible
[22:55:21] <manicennui> companion_cube: MMA
[22:55:37] <dminkovsky> i had my eyes closed half the time
[22:55:38] <companion_cube> ah, that must be intense
[22:55:42] <companion_cube> it
[22:55:46] <dminkovsky> it was extremely intense for me
[22:55:50] <companion_cube> it's like fist + kicks + grappling, right?
[22:55:55] <companion_cube> fists*
[22:56:11] <dminkovsky> yeah
[22:56:25] <manicennui> It's more about what's not allowed.
[22:56:27] <dminkovsky> and you pummel people when they're down until they can't defend themselves
[22:56:29] <manicennui> The rest is just what works.
[22:56:45] <companion_cube> do you have a link so I can get an idea?
[22:56:55] <manicennui> dminkovsky: The refs are generally very good at stopping the fights when the person isn't defending themselves.
[22:56:55] <companion_cube> I'd watch that more than any other sport, I think
[22:57:11] <manicennui> You also can't do things like strike the back of the head.
[22:57:32] <dminkovsky> manicennui: yeah i'm not saying they're not
[22:57:51] <manicennui> dminkovsky: The problem is you don't want to not attack them while they are down and they recover.
[22:58:26] <manicennui> Getting knocked out is very strange.
[22:58:35] <manicennui> It's not what people expect really.
[22:58:37] <dminkovsky> it was this: v
[22:58:40] <manicennui> They are rarely out cold.
[22:58:41] <dminkovsky> whoops, this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_263
[22:58:41] <buttsbot> UFC 263 - Wikipedia
[22:58:55] <dminkovsky> it was pretty incredible in a way
[22:59:04] <manicennui> And it can be triggered by a hit to just the right place that isn't especially hard.
[22:59:10] <dminkovsky> diaz/edwards
[22:59:18] <manicennui> Diaz is nuts.
[22:59:32] <dminkovsky> hey almost got edwards at the end after getting fucked the whole fight
[22:59:38] <dminkovsky> it was beyond comprehension
[23:01:04] <dminkovsky> < manicennui> It's not what people expect really.
[23:01:08] <dminkovsky> have you been knocked out?
[23:04:34] <dminkovsky> anyway i wouldn't seek out more UFC despite it being pretty amazing
[23:04:39] <dminkovsky> it's fucked up
[23:04:41] <dminkovsky> imo
[23:07:58] <manicennui> dminkovsky: No, I haven't.
[23:08:20] <dminkovsky> that's good
[23:08:47] <manicennui> I wouldn't mind learning to box, but I don't want to get hit in the head.
[23:09:06] <manicennui> Don't want to damage my thinkbone.
[23:09:43] <dminkovsky> i had a friend who boxed on the southside in college
[23:09:48] <dminkovsky> then got drawn into a sparring event
[23:09:52] <dminkovsky> didn't box after that lol
[23:10:09] <dminkovsky> i was like "bro are you seriously going to expore yourslef to getting hit... for fun...?"
[23:10:14] <dminkovsky> he was like "yeah it'll be okay"
[23:10:23] <dminkovsky> came back and was like "yeah it was not okay"
[23:10:43] <manicennui> Did they use headgear?
[23:10:49] <dminkovsky> s/expore/expose/
[23:10:57] <dminkovsky> i'm sure but he got hit square in the nose
[23:10:59] <dminkovsky> he told me
[23:11:08] <dminkovsky> and he is a very good looking person
[23:11:20] <dminkovsky> anyway head trauma of any kind is bad.
[23:11:39] <imode> this is trippy.
[23:12:08] <dminkovsky> what is imode
[23:12:16] <manicennui> He is watching the Matrix movie.
[23:12:20] <dminkovsky> oh jesus
[23:12:22] <manicennui> Maybe he is starting to like it.
[23:12:23] <dminkovsky> never seen the matrix?
[23:12:28] <manicennui> The new one.
[23:12:36] <dminkovsky> didnt know there was a new one
[23:13:09] <manicennui> He was hating it, but "this is trippy" seems like it might be good.
[23:13:12] <indigo> Is it an NxM matrix
[23:13:43] <dminkovsky> lol
[23:14:07] <dminkovsky> very good
[23:14:11] <imode> this is like all the first 3 movies condensed into one.
[23:14:21] <imode> hating the blue haired chick a little less.
[23:14:27] <companion_cube> is it a different story? or a sequel?
[23:14:32] <imode> mmmm.
[23:14:43] <dminkovsky> are you redpilled yet imode
[23:14:55] <manicennui> I think it is a sequel.
[23:15:01] <imode> it's a sequel.
[23:15:07] <companion_cube> oh interesting
[23:15:07] <manicennui> And might play on the whole "the Matrix repeats itself".
[23:16:01] <imode> zion looks more impressive.
[23:16:14] <companion_cube> we're going to watch it this WE
[23:16:31] <manicennui> Neo is your Jesus?
[23:18:04] <imode> this movie is as if jesus came back.
[23:18:14] <imode> but without his powers.
[23:18:40] <imode> it closes an interesting loop.
[23:20:32] <companion_cube> man UFC is violent
[23:20:45] <indigo> What if Jesus came back but only had cheese powers
[23:20:51] <indigo> Would we call him Cheesus
[23:21:13] <bkero> Cheesus Christ that was a bad joke
[23:21:13] <imode> you're on to some shit, indigo.
[23:21:28] <manicennui> I support food-based religion.

[23:22:39] <companion_cube> "eat this bread, for it is good"
[23:22:44] <companion_cube> she'd multiple fishes alright
[23:22:53] <companion_cube> (or wine, or breadcrumbs, whatever)
[23:23:01] <manicennui> Jesus was a baker who made perfect croissants and baguette.
[23:24:05] <manicennui> Mary's miracle was discovering sourdough.
[23:24:36] <dminkovsky> cowboys discovered sourdough
[23:24:49] <manicennui> God inseminated her loaf with wild microbes.
[23:25:02] <manicennui> dminkovsky: ?
[23:25:10] <dminkovsky> manicennui: ?
[23:25:12] <dminkovsky> lol
[23:25:16] <dminkovsky> < manicennui> God inseminated her loaf with wild microbes.
[23:25:17] <manicennui> Was that a serious claim?
[23:25:33] <dminkovsky> naa ancients probably discovered sourdough
[23:25:39] <dminkovsky> but cowboys did make sourdough
[23:26:00] <manicennui> Sourdough is just what everyone called bread until we created fast acting yeast.
[23:26:10] <manicennui> It is thought that the Egyptians discovered it.
[23:26:16] <manicennui> Left some porridge out.
[23:26:17] <companion_cube> shit, I should try and get into martial arts once covid is under control
[23:27:00] <dminkovsky> manicennui: yeah
[23:27:09] <dminkovsky> will covid ever be over
[23:27:14] <manicennui> Nope.
[23:27:24] <dminkovsky> looking like it
[23:27:42] <companion_cube> "under control", not "over"
[23:27:59] <dminkovsky> i wonder how
[23:28:04] <manicennui> You'll have to learn martial arts between spikes.
[23:28:09] <companion_cube> :D
[23:28:20] <companion_cube> anyway, it's awesome for cardio
[23:28:47] <dminkovsky> we were supposed to have some friends come from nyc for NYE
[23:28:53] <dminkovsky> looks like we're going to cancel
[23:29:10] <dminkovsky> although i don't know why
[23:29:13] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Gracie
[23:29:14] <buttsbot> Royce Gracie - Wikipedia
[23:29:16] <manicennui> You should read about that guy.
[23:29:21] <indigo> dminkovsky: Omicron!!!
[23:29:21] <manicennui> He fundamentally changed MMA.
[23:29:35] <dminkovsky> indigo: well yeah
[23:29:37] <indigo> Fauci says it's OK to get together if you are all boosted though
[23:29:42] <dminkovsky> but my child?
[23:29:50] <dminkovsky> they're boosted, we're boosted
[23:30:05] <dminkovsky> but i have a kid? other people send their kids to schools and daycare and stuff
[23:30:06] <manicennui> By boosted he means stoned as fuck.
[23:30:10] <dminkovsky> lol
[23:30:41] <indigo> I got boosted = broke, car got boosted = woke
[23:30:51] <indigo> Yeah good call, don't want to get your kid sick
[23:31:09] <indigo> Are you guys making any traditional dishes for NYE? :D Herring under the fur coat???
[23:31:18] <manicennui> The first years of UFC were crazy as fuck.
[23:31:22] <manicennui> No one knew what worked.
[23:31:30] <manicennui> And we quickly learned that a lot of shit didn't work at all.
[23:31:47] <manicennui> But to everyone's surprise, grappling and submission holds were huge.
[23:32:07] <manicennui> Now everyone basically learns at least one striking sport and one grappling/submission sport.
[23:32:19] <manicennui> With BJJ being one of the most popular for the latter.
[23:32:32] <imode> meh, it got bad again.
[23:32:32] <manicennui> Gracie won some ridiculous fights with submission holds.
[23:32:50] <dminkovsky> indigo: seems like no one i know is concerned about their kid getting sick from covid, except me
[23:32:57] <companion_cube> what's BJJ?
[23:33:07] <dminkovsky> and i think they might be right
[23:33:14] <manicennui> Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
[23:33:30] <dminkovsky> indigo: yes for sure. it would have been awesome w/ my friends from NY but alas, it'll be good w/ my wife too
[23:33:34] <dminkovsky> how about you
[23:33:54] <dminkovsky> (they're not russian but they love the herring under fur as well)
[23:34:19] <manicennui> Under fur?
[23:34:34] <indigo> I dunno; I might try making beef daube again, but this time I'll use my pressure cooker so it doesn't take so damn long

[23:35:06] <manicennui> Hmm.
[23:35:14] <manicennui> I like pickled herring, and I like beets.
[23:35:25] * dminkovsky googles beef daube
[23:35:57] <manicennui> Are you originally from Russia?
[23:35:59] <dminkovsky> i think i'm going to get drunk on vodka. i just decided this
[23:36:03] <dminkovsky> i am from ukraine
[23:36:08] <manicennui> Ah.
[23:36:09] <dminkovsky> aka russia in 6 months
[23:36:25] <manicennui> Ever go to Russian Tea Time when you were in Chicago?
[23:36:48] <manicennui> They do pan-former Soviet Union cuisine.
[23:37:01] <manicennui> And great Russian tea.
[23:37:12] <dminkovsky> no i didn't
[23:37:30] <dminkovsky> my oligarch russian girlfriend at the time did though
[23:37:36] <dminkovsky> so i bet it was ok
[23:38:39] <dminkovsky> you go there ?
[23:38:50] <manicennui> I've been there a couple of times.
[23:39:15] <dminkovsky> here's a movie recommendation

[23:40:29] <manicennui> Seems the head chef is Ukrainian.
[23:40:32] <dminkovsky> oh lol 1993
[23:40:44] <indigo> Heh, I was talking to my grandparents over the weekend
[23:40:53] <dminkovsky> i must be thinking of some other place, then
[23:42:00] <indigo> They were like "you know, Poland used to be part of Russia once"
[23:42:13] <dminkovsky> it sure was :)
[23:42:47] <manicennui> I love when work meetings devolve into shooting the shit.
[23:43:09] <dminkovsky> sarcasm?
[23:43:13] <manicennui> No.
[23:43:21] <manicennui> I like shooting the shit.
[23:43:42] <dminkovsky> let's shoot the shit
[23:44:51] <dminkovsky> if ukraine get's invaded properly by russia, you'd think poland and the baltic states would form an alliance against them
[23:44:59] <dminkovsky> gets
[23:45:28] <bkero> invaded properly again
[23:46:34] <dminkovsky> i was being generous
[23:46:44] <dminkovsky> but yeah bkero
[23:47:06] <bkero> Ukraine has spent like half of its existence being colonized
[23:47:27] <dminkovsky> it's right in the middle there
[23:47:40] <manicennui> dminkovsky: What do you think about Gogol Bordello?
[23:47:47] <dminkovsky> ukrainain nationalism, like all nationalism, is somewhat contrived
[23:48:15] <dminkovsky> manicennui: i'm not too into them but everyone i know is
[23:48:23] <manicennui> I like them a lot.
[23:48:29] <manicennui> Saw them live. It was pretty crazy.
[23:48:32] <manicennui> Very high energy.
[23:48:37] <dminkovsky> yeah i have a friend who sees them every NYE
[23:48:39] <dminkovsky> either in DC or NY
[23:48:44] <manicennui> They extended their songs and made the build ups even more insane.
[23:48:53] <manicennui> And they have two dancers on stage to hype the crowd.
[23:48:56] <dminkovsky> my mom and sister see them when they're in DC too
[23:49:14] <manicennui> We were in an old theater (most of Chicago's venues are) and I thought the balcony might collapse from everyone jumping.
[23:49:23] <dminkovsky> that's fucking scary
[23:49:24] <manicennui> Have you seen the movie he is in?
[23:49:29] <dminkovsky> balconeis collapse
[23:49:29] <manicennui> The lead singer.
[23:49:34] <dminkovsky> yeah what's that ovie
[23:49:38] <dminkovsky> i have not
[23:49:43] <manicennui> Everything is Illuminated
[23:49:47] <dminkovsky> yes, that one
[23:49:55] <manicennui> He is hilarious in it.
[23:50:10] <manicennui> His character is into like 80s American culture.
[23:50:11] <dminkovsky> he's talented and everyone rightly loves him and GB
[23:50:32] <manicennui> Movie is pretty sad.
[23:50:36] <manicennui> But really good.
[23:51:02] <manicennui> Mostly true too.
[23:51:29] <manicennui> I've never read his famous book on vegetarianism.
[23:51:45] <manicennui> The author of the book that was adapted for Everything Is Illuminated.
[23:52:18] <imode> this took weird turns.
[23:52:24] <imode> not ones I like.
[23:52:47] <imode> they could've done far better.
[23:52:49] <manicennui> I really want people to make movies that are commentary on the people watching it.
[23:53:35] <manicennui> Mike Judge's movies and TV shows could be seen as that to some extent.
[23:53:41] <manicennui> But he does it in a way that people don't feel insulted.
[23:53:44] <imode> this is playing off more like a heist movie than an actual matrix movie.
[23:53:53] <imode> like, there's five different plot lines.
[23:54:32] <dminkovsky> every matrix after the first one is just beyond comprehensible to me
[23:54:42] <manicennui> Yeah.
[23:54:54] <manicennui> I'm not sure I could tell you what the first two sequels are about exactly.
[23:54:54] <dminkovsky> i get the vibe that the way to make things seem "smart" in mass media/culture is to make it confusing as fuck
[23:54:54] <imode> the last two are just jesus metaphors.
[23:55:08] <imode> yeah that's about it. intelligence by obscurity, dminkovsky
[23:55:12] <manicennui> The last one eventually became Neo dealing with a rogue agent.
[23:55:29] <indigo> https://youtu.be/gCyrKJg-1VM
[23:55:30] <buttsbot> Matrix Nerds - YouTube - https://youtu.be/gCyrKJg-1VM
[23:55:35] <manicennui> But you never really learn what is going on with all of the shit they reveal.
[23:56:32] <imode> I feel like hollywood movies right now are about digging pits, and then climbing out of them. there's a point in this movie where neo says something, and I realized, that it added nothing to the overall plot, or story, it's just explaining that there was a build-up to this point.
[23:56:53] <imode> and now that that has reached its apex, it's time we start climbing out.
[23:57:37] <imode> the rest of the details about how far down the pit was dug, how you built the retaining walls, are all explained after you've built it and are starting to climb out of it.
[23:57:47] <manicennui> I think the balance between art and commerce has tipped to like 90% commerce in the last decade or so.
[23:58:07] <manicennui> At best you get a great performance or music or something out of it.
[23:58:08] <imode> you use expository dialogue as a justification for how you got there, without really lining up the pieces properly. you just dug a hole and dropped us in it.
[23:58:45] <imode> you introduce small emotional moments that don't really mean anything, moreso just to coax more of a performance out of the people you've got to star your characters.
[23:58:58] <manicennui> Can we just admit that The Wachowskis were never actually that good?
[23:58:59] <imode> you show sorrow but you don't get it context. you show regret, but you don't give it subtance.
[23:59:03] <manicennui> And The Matrix was a fluke?
[23:59:20] <manicennui> "At this point in the story we need a sad moment."
[23:59:57] <imode> I'm 1:50 in.
