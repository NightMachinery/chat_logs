[00:30:41] <fakuve> Hi there guys , so I needed to make a payment online , and I can only pay this company via coinpayments.net
[00:31:13] <fakuve> So without much knowledge of the issue , I created an account there , and passed the KYC
[00:31:34] <fakuve> to right away purchase Coins (from within coinpayments.net)
[00:32:25] <fakuve> I have made the transfer with my Credit Card already but seems that the wallet balance is still 0.0 
[00:33:01] <fakuve> whereas I got a the deposit of my purchase now pending to be payed
[00:33:12] <fakuve> But I cant see no money in the Wallet whatsoever
[00:34:54] <fakuve> I got the mercurio ID though from the transaction
[00:35:16] <fakuve> Cause I have actually made a transfer to Tallin , but I may be missing something
[00:36:18] <fakuve> oh yep
[00:36:22] <fakuve> wrong channel
[00:36:24] <fakuve> sry

[00:46:41] <Alipha> fakuve: yes, off topic, but i'll just say my two cents: i've never heard of coinpayments.net, so if you have to use them, i'd instead give my credit card info to a more well-known exchange like binance, and then only transfer what you need into coinpayments.net
[00:48:04] <fakuve> Alipha: thanks , It supposed to be established this company already , the issue is that I may have probably made a purchase of coins without having setted a wallet first (I mean I had an account already)
[00:48:22] <fakuve> So I dont know how to get those funds now , is pretty weird

[01:19:43] <fakuve> Ok the issue was that the transaction needed to be verified
[01:20:07] <TimMc> fakuve: And this entity you're going to make a payment to, you're sure they aren't scamming you?
[01:20:08] <fakuve> its taking its time , this blockchain thing , I mean I remember using BTC back 4 years ago and It was almost inmediate
[01:20:20] <fakuve> yes , is not a problem
[01:20:25] <fakuve> all the parts are legit
[01:20:41] <TimMc> OK, just checking. "Only takes cryptocurrency" sets off alarm bells for me. :-)
[01:20:54] <fakuve> yeyeah hehem I'm not that noob only a bit ehhem
[01:21:01] <TimMc> :-)
[01:42:04] <Alipha> I once got an email saying I won some BTC. I was curious, so I decided to follow the link and sign up. Used a throw away email address and password. After signing up, they said I had to verify my wallet by depositing a small amount of BTC to it. I noped right out of that
[01:43:22] <wasamasa> imagine the same thing, but with dollars

[23:22:41] <TheWild> folks, I stumbled upon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm
[23:22:41] <TheWild> is there an advantage of using seemingly overcomplicated algorithm instead of plain RSA? You know, create a hash, sign it using private key and everyone can verify the hash using public key.
[23:23:24] <TheWild> (RSA, of course with proper padding)
[23:23:25] <yawkat> "simple" RSA
[23:24:53] <danieldg> TheWild: you can't do RSA on elliptic curves
[23:27:29] <TheWild> RSA, ECDSA, whatever... the method of signing and verifying doesn't change.
[23:27:57] <TheWild> ah, I meant ECC
[23:29:58] <danieldg> ECDSA and DSA are mostly the same, yes
[23:31:21] <yawkat> RSA is very different from other signature algorithms

[23:39:28] <TheWild> maybe I don't get a thing.
[23:39:28] <TheWild> I see public key cryptography as the following: some math+entropy and BOOM: we have two functions: d for decryption and e for encryption (technically those are numbers or tuples of numbers but it doesn't matter right now). While d is solely for me, e can be shared to anyone.
[23:39:28] <TheWild> A document can be signed by calculating its hash using whatever agreed algorithm, then d(hash) is added to document (preferably as separate file as to not change the hash of document). Anyone can then verify it using e(hash).
[23:40:03] <TheWild> Since I can't immediately read it from that mathematical mess, does DSA generate anything like d and e or it's something else?
[23:40:07] <danieldg> that's very rsa-centric
[23:40:18] <danieldg> more generic: key-agreement and signature
[23:40:22] <yawkat> yes, it doesnt work at all for ECC
[23:40:32] <yawkat> and for RSA it's insecure
[23:41:49] <TheWild> "rsa-centric"
[23:42:07] <danieldg> TheWild: a key agreement algorithm combines public keys to produce a shared secret which you can use for encryption
[23:42:08] <TheWild> even ECC generates something like d and e (I suppose)
[23:42:12] <yawkat> no
[23:42:14] <danieldg> no, it does not
[23:42:41] <danieldg> the shared secret does not produce a d/e that combine like RSA does
[23:43:32] *** Quits: rndm (~rndm@143.59.164.79) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:44:19] <danieldg> RSA in practice can be used as a key agreement mechanism, but the fact that the "e" function for agreemnet is the same one used for verification is basically only in RSA
[23:45:58] *** Joins: rndm (~rndm@143.59.164.79)
[23:47:31] <yawkat> imho teaching rsa first is a mistake
[23:47:36] <yawkat> schnorr is much better
[23:51:03] <TheWild> wikipedia: Elliptic curves are applicable for key agreement, digital signatures, pseudo-random generators and other tasks. *Indirectly*, they can be used for encryption by combining the key agreement with a symmetric encryption scheme.
[23:51:03] <TheWild> so ECC isn't encryption on it's own, it just a piece of bigger mechanism.
[23:52:05] <yawkat> yes, by key exchange
[23:52:09] <danieldg> RSA is rarely used for encryption on its own (and that's the easiest way to do it insecurely)
[23:52:16] <danieldg> so really no different
[23:52:22] <TheWild> yawkat: well, I think I know what you mean. Key agreement is more fundamental; private/public key generation comes after. 
[23:53:09] <yawkat> ?
[23:53:32] <yawkat> how are you going to do key agreement without a public key
[23:53:37] *** Quits: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414) (Quit: THE RAM IS TOO DAMN HIGH)
[23:54:37] <TheWild> dunno
[23:55:08] <danieldg> note: key agreement is an algorithm, not a decision
[23:58:00] <TheWild> if ECC doesn't generate d and e (like in d(short message with padding)/e(short message with padding), not d(long message) or d(long message), then what it does?
[23:58:32] <yawkat> sign and verify, or a key exchange
[23:58:33] <TheWild> folks, you are either fooling me or we didn't /agree/ to some words
[23:58:45] <yawkat> signing has nothing to do with encrypting
