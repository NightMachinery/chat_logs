[00:04:18] <fsbot> VSCode is Visual Studio Code, a text-editor or IDE based on Electron https://code.visualstudio.com/
[00:04:32] <sabas3dgh> the packages that i see are from 2014
[00:04:38] <bremner> dunno. I think there is a clang thing that some people like?
[00:04:50] <sabas3dgh> bremner name?
[00:04:59] <bremner> I don't use it. Or remember the name.
[00:05:11] <Catie> Is that the LSP thing people talk about a lot?
[00:05:34] <bremner> I think the clang thing is separate, but I could be wrong
[00:05:44] <bremner> anyway, lsp is probably worth investigating
[00:05:55] <Catie> Oh, clangd maybe?
[00:07:02] <bremner> "emacs clangd" has some hits. Some mentioning lsp

[00:30:18] <acdw> oh yueah i heard of them
[00:30:54] <e1f> the trucking industry is regulated by the federal govt. which mandated that all employees in regulated industries have to be vaccinated
[00:31:07] <e1f> 90% of truckers are vaccinated
[00:31:13] <Lolsr> Aye. things seem to be running.. fairly okay in richmond/vancouver. All the shops in the nearby center are open.

[00:34:26] <Lolsr> lolya had some funny weather up here in BC
[00:34:34] <Lolsr> man i think embark is really changing the way i use emacs as was mentioned in that cool 15 things to do in embark article.
[00:34:36] <e1f> the ottawa police seemed to have 1) under-estimated the protest 2) the protest organizers are former prime-minister security detail rcmp officers
[00:34:50] <e1f> so they know the ottawa area quite well
[00:36:14] <e1f> also, the toronto metropd budget is $1B, the ottawa budget is quite a bit less, i assume as they declared a state of emergency requesting an additional 2k officers
[00:36:51] <e1f> one would have though the national's capitol would have an better prepared police force
[00:38:05] <Lolsr> population difference?
[00:38:07] <acdw> one would've thought
[00:38:17] <acdw> e1f: one would've thought the same about DC last 1/6
[00:38:40] <e1f> oh definitely, there's a big difference in pop.
[00:38:49] <Catie> acdw: Ain't the cops just let the protestors in at DC though?
[00:39:10] <e1f> it was only at one entrance iirc
[00:39:16] <Lolsr> toronto to ottawa is pretty nearby anyway no?
[00:39:23] <e1f> but that was enough, of course

[03:46:16] <zeta_0[m]> https://github.com/millejoh/emacs-ipython-notebook/issues/829
[03:46:33] <zeta_0[m]> ^ If any of you wouldn't mind taking a look at this issue, thanks.
[03:47:02] <irek> corwin: I thought that erc already can hide chosen type of messages.  Or is it removing them instead of hiding?
[03:47:12] <zeta_0[m]> I haven't used Emacs-IPython-Notebook in a long time, so maybe something is wrong with my .emacs config?
[03:47:45] <corwin> irek: it drops them, without a way to view what was dropped later on.
[03:48:16] <irek> So as I thought.  Hiding is better.  Rcirc does it that way, its handy.
[03:48:39] <corwin> irek: also, it's not per channel.  in small channels I usually want to show more message types.
[03:49:09] <corwin> irek: what is the function for that?  I actually went looking for something to crib from and couldn't find it.  But ... it's not too late :P
[03:50:09] <irek> corwin: Oh it works per channel.  That's convenient +1
[03:50:43] <irek> corwin: in rcirc it's `rcirc-omit-mode' under C-c C-o
[03:51:19] <zeta_0[m]> In the github issue that I posted, do those errors have to do with `treemacs` or do they have to do with `EIN`?
[03:51:52] <corwin> irek: the other feature I like of my version is that it has an interactive function with completion over channels as well as over message types, with some conv types (:all :none) which ignore/include everything except PRIVMSG

[03:54:09] <irek> Nice.  I will probably look around your code later.  I have never done anything with "hiding" stuff in Emacs.
[03:55:04] <corwin> Thanks for the reference.  It seems to be implemented the same way I'm going: using buffer-invisibility-spec
[03:55:31] <irek> So this is the way

[03:57:44] <corwin> I guess.  There are issues with using tons and tons of overlays (which is what invisibility is, behind the curtain) so I'd been thinking about refinements or alternatives in case, e.g someone has lots of channels, is always connected, and doesn't truncate their buffers ever.  But I guess rcirc users aren't having that issue (or there's no comments about it in code, anyway)

[04:00:31] <Catie> I use rcirc-omit-mode in every single IRC buffer I have, and the only issue I run into is that sometimes if I mouse-select some text I'll get a bunch of IRC status messages along with the text I wanted
[04:01:16] <corwin> Catie: I've noticed that with erc-hide-line also.  I haven't been bothered enough to do anything about it, so far.
[04:01:40] <Catie> I don't think I've ever had an IRC buffer get to 10000 lines before though, so maybe I just haven't hit the threshold for performance issues?

[06:03:04] <mfiano> I use it as a safety net. If you view the full log ("la" in the status buffer I think), you can recover some foot shots, since silent commits to the wip refs are made before/after saving the file, etc

[06:10:23] <Catie> Oh, near as I can tell Magit will just autosave uncommitted work. So it can be integrated with a fixup commit, but it mostly just helps if you've lost some work

[18:36:13] <Shortstop> do you download themes into a 'themes' directory in '~/.emacs.d' aka '~/.emacs.d/themes', and if so, that would be fair game to just 'load it' via 'M-x load-theme' right?
[18:36:25] <corwin> My point is, there are likely several ways to get what you are after and the best choice is usually the one that you understand well.

[19:27:37] <corwin> Themes don't have any affect (that I understand) on font selection.  The magic bit of font selection is where Emacs can load a (potentially otherwise not used) font to find something that has a glyph for a character it has encountered.
