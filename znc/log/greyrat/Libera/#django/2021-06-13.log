[12:11:14] <onorbumbum> @FunkyBob thank you for your response. I am using django-storages to upload large files to backblaze

[12:11:53] <onorbumbum> with no luck.
[12:17:41] <FunkyBob> so... are you uploading directly from the browser to backblaze?  or via your django server?
[12:18:00] <FunkyBob> if you want the XHR progress, I've done that before
[12:18:23] <FunkyBob> but that's only how much data the browser has sent

[13:13:54] <onorbumbum> it is from browser to backblaze. When i try the xhr, the progres goes to 100 from 0 in few seconds and then the actual upload takes as long as it needs to take
[13:14:04] <onorbumbum> I am so sorry for such late responses.
[13:17:36] <FunkyBob> so django and djangoo-storages have nothing to do with the question, then
[13:19:08] <FunkyBob> but without seeing the code involved, it's hard to see what may be going wrong
[13:37:21] <Batzy> is there a way to query with the django ORM a list of field values and get back a summary of whether or not if there are any rows with those values?
[13:38:25] <Batzy> so if I have an Instrument table, i want to do a query like type = ['percussion', 'strings'] and output would say if there are things in my Instrument table of type percussion and type strings
[13:40:08] <Batzy> I get so confused by annotate

[17:31:52] <najtsirk> When I create a new app in a subfolder (apps/users) with `python manage.py startapp users apps/users` AppConfig.name (UsersConfig.name) = 'users', but it should be 'apps.users', correct?
[17:32:23] <najtsirk> My app is not getting found event though I have it INSTALLED_APPS=[..., 'apps.users', ...]

[17:49:54] <knbk> najtsirk: I think you'll need to use `startapp apps.users apps/users`
[17:50:40] <knbk> if that works... otherwise it's a limitation in Django
[17:51:32] <kenbolton> What is with the anti-semitic messages on #django on freenode that direct users here? That seems to go against the CoC and makes the community look really bad.
[17:52:13] <knbk> kenbolton: as far as I know, the Django community has lost all control over that channel to the freenode operators
[17:53:19] <kenbolton> they look to be automated messages coming from users.
[17:53:46] <najtsirk> knbk: thanks I will check that
[17:54:07] <kenbolton> a really bad look for an otherwise excellent framework.
[17:54:34] <najtsirk> knbk: one more thing  - do you know how can one do app_label.ModelName in that case? I cannot do apps.users.User
[17:54:48] <GinFuyou> Yes, if you have complaints, tell them to new freenode administration. Not like we changed server because we just felt like that one day
[17:55:08] <knbk> najtsirk: the app *label* is still `users`, only the app name is apps.users
[17:55:20] <GinFuyou> No idea what is bot intentions, looks like attempt to deface libera
[17:56:19] <najtsirk> knbk: I got `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: AUTH_USER_MODEL refers to model 'users.User' that has not been installed`

[18:00:25] <knbk> kenbolton: if this is by users on freenode it might be good to still report to the CoC committee. While django doesn't have control over the channel, the committee should still be able to access it and possibly do something
[18:00:30] <GinFuyou> Ok, not bad wallbroken, 25 and 26 not needed though
[18:01:10] <GinFuyou> wallbroken, we need a new view now that would actually change the mail
[18:01:26] <GinFuyou> iirc activate() view was a good base for it
[18:03:11] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/HBuF
[18:05:45] <GinFuyou> wallbroken, indentation is broken. copy that view, remove uidb64 from atrgs, and try-except block. user will be request.user instead. could add login_required
[18:07:15] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/2Kx0
[18:08:23] <GinFuyou> it's still under method of update view... it's a view of itself, just function-based. and you want to rename it, e.g. confirm_mail_change() or something
[18:08:51] <GinFuyou> then add url pattern for it. again it will like for activate but without uid part
[18:09:59] <wallbroken> uid = urlsafe_base64_decode().decode()
[18:10:04] <wallbroken> do i need to remove this line?
[18:10:31] <GinFuyou> yes, we are not using uid at all
[18:10:44] <GinFuyou> we pick user from request as usual
[18:11:09] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/WqvV
[18:11:31] <GinFuyou> you only removed 1 line?
[18:12:08] <wallbroken> and fixed the other things you told before
[18:12:46] <GinFuyou> user part is still broken leftover
[18:13:23] <wallbroken> user = UserModel._default_manager.get(pk=uid)
[18:13:31] <wallbroken> do i need to remove "pk=uid" ?
[18:13:53] <GinFuyou> all of it. I'm telling we are using request.user
[18:14:04] <wallbroken> the entire line?
[18:16:44] <GinFuyou> yes. could change user = None to use request.user
[18:16:53] <wallbroken> ok, done

[18:26:12] <wallbroken> what is that?
[18:26:52] <GinFuyou> pretty much full view after you set user
[18:27:04] <GinFuyou> confirm_mail_change() one
[18:27:09] <wallbroken> what do i need to do?
[18:27:46] <GinFuyou> set user and replace code below with it. you can see it's similar
[18:28:02] <wallbroken> replace my confirm_mail_change body with that one?
[18:28:28] <GinFuyou> then we'll need one more line in user update later to make it work
[18:28:35] <GinFuyou> wallbroken, yes, after you set user
[18:28:46] <wallbroken> what do you mean "after you set user" ?
[18:29:20] <GinFuyou> you can see it uses "user", want to see it undefined error again?
[18:29:23] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/mCEp
[18:29:35] <wallbroken> correct?
[18:30:05] <GinFuyou> technically, but do you want user to be None?
[18:30:24] <wallbroken> self.object ?
[18:31:07] <GinFuyou> no, I told it before

[19:37:07] <mihael> Can I get your thought on what best approach to do on that?
[19:38:26] <GinFuyou> It's vague. Can User be of several types at same type (ex: Coach and Admin)? What are difference between users? For unique data can be stored on specific types and so on
[19:39:15] <mihael> A user can only be one type, different users will have additional fields depending on their type, and permissions on resources
[19:46:06] <GinFuyou> well, permissions are not so straight-forward to manage with different kinds of users
