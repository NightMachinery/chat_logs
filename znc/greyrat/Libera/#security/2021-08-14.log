[03:45:36] <TimMc> Joanna: Because if someone says they're Chinese you're going to start grilling them on China conspiracy theories.
[03:46:00] <Joanna> No I would ask them questions about china though

[03:48:25] <Hash> Joanna | So if we have a chinese person here they are refusing to talk . A lot of good that does us ! <- you have no idea what kind of people are here, with what kind of backgrounds. Perhaps this makes them not want to talk and participate.

[03:57:43] <legend> I like spicy sichuan food
[03:58:07] <TimMc> Restaurant food is also restaurant food -- no matter where you go, it's not really going to be what people eat at home.
[03:58:22] <mats1> quality furnishings, hot food brought from the kitchen rather than carts, proper seating where you're not elbow to elbow with some guy you don't know
[03:58:33] <TimMc> and that's even without adapting it to a foreign palette
[03:59:02] <Joanna> I consider restaurant food low quality it never has whole grain rice or wheat flour for instance
[03:59:20] <TimMc> I can't get American home-cooked food in a restaurant in America, for instance. Such as casserole!
[03:59:24] <ilikeyou> o nice mats1 , i'll check it out

[04:09:21] <TimMc> And easy, once I got the hang of cooking the chickpeas.

[04:12:24] <TimMc> Joanna: Going back to the Apple thing, I did want to correct a misconception you seemed to have -- the software doesn't look for "naked children" in the abstract, but rather checks for images with a specific hash.
[04:12:40] <TimMc> so it's not going to report you for harmless kid-in-bathtub photos
[04:12:58] <TimMc> well, at least not as currently described
[04:13:45] <TimMc> There's apparently some other thing that tries to tell if there are sexually explicit images, but that's for warning the user (a kid) they might be about to see something they don't want to see. Something like that.
[04:14:27] <TimMc> and honestly *that* part seems absolutely fine to me
[04:14:36] <Joanna> TimMc: yes but i don’t want anyone getting into my photos without my permission even if it’s a photo of the ground.

[04:15:16] <TimMc> Well, sure, yeah, it's creepy and bad for a number of reasons. I just wanted to clarify that point.
[04:16:44] <Joanna> I don’t understand with all these fancy solutions in search of problems why nobody is willing to do the unthinkable and ban smut from the internet. I think there might be some countries that don’t allow such things . Maybe it was Cuba that bans porn and devil worship stuff.
[04:17:46] <Joanna> TimMc: keep in mind things don’t stay as they are at this moment we are always moving ever faster down the slippery slope.
[04:17:55] <TimMc> « The on-device encrypted CSAM database contains only entries that were independently submitted by two or more child safety organizations operating in separate sovereign jurisdictions, i.e. not under the control of the same government. »
[04:18:17] <TimMc> ^ This might be acceptable to me if I believed it would actually be implemented this way.
[04:19:43] <Joanna> We don’t need all this fancy stuff we need people to parent their kids properly and that includes not leaving children alone for hours getting programmed by something on a screen.
[04:20:30] <TimMc> Well, which thing are you talking about?
[04:20:52] <Joanna> Tv and all the technologies that followed it.
[04:21:07] <TimMc> "Communications safety in Messages" or "CSAM detection"?
[04:21:08] <TimMc> oh
[04:21:14] <TimMc> so... not about Apple at all

[13:39:57] <dyeplexer> Say that I have a server with a service running on it. It has an admin panel accessible over http. I have restricted this port to be accessible through localhost only and admins will access the port via SSH port forwarding/tunneling. Thus any admins of the server must be authenticated via SSH to get the admin panel. All SSH users use SSH keys to authenticate and the shell prompt for these users are disabled. Password authentication isn't allowed.
[13:39:58] <dyeplexer> How secure is this setup?

[16:17:49] <Apachez> good example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG
[16:18:56] <edk> they also just do different things. a true random number generator introduces new information into the world (at least for the definition of information we care about) rather than widening some input; it can never be bruteforced and its past output can never be reasoned about
[16:19:39] <edk> if you were attacking a one-time pad generated by a CSPRNG you could, at least in principle, bruteforce the CSPRNG state to recover the pad
[16:20:27] <electr0n> psuedo rng over time and analysis can become deterministic. \\\
[16:20:51] <electr0n> fail.
[16:28:24] <Apachez> the tricky part is also that a true rng is often an external device
[16:28:36] <Apachez> and there is this strip with how do you know its truly random?
[16:28:51] <Apachez> if it sits there saying just "8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8" it can still be random :P
[16:30:53] <velix> So, what's the best? I thought CSPRNG is best.
[16:31:15] <Apachez> in short "it depends"
[16:31:20] <velix> cryptography
[16:31:32] <Apachez> the ones provided by various oses is often considered "good enough"
[16:31:44] <Apachez> often it boils down to bad implementations
[16:31:50] <Apachez> 7zip had some years ago such example
[16:31:54] <velix> Apachez: Isn't Dual_EC_DRBG bad at all, since it's deteministic?
[16:31:59] <Apachez> they use aes256 which on paper should take many years to bruteforce
[16:32:00] <velix> deterministic sounds like: naahh
[16:32:10] <Apachez> turned out that their implementation of aes256 was broken
[16:32:22] <Apachez> to begin with it had too few rounds or something like that so it was actually aes128
[16:32:34] <Apachez> and to top that of half of the bits in the key were always 0
[16:32:44] <velix> who uses 7zip to crypt stuff ?
[16:32:51] <Apachez> so in reality 7zip's implementation of aes256 was more like aes64 (if such had existed)
[16:33:07] <Apachez> meaning it took just a few minutes with a good gpu to bruteforce 7zip password protected files
[16:33:19] <Apachez> well its handy for passphrase protection
[16:33:29] <Apachez> open source, zero cost, exists for all oses
[16:33:36] <Apachez> but this was just an example
[16:33:54] <velix> hmm... tar | zstd | gpg
[16:34:00] <Apachez> another years ago (forgot the name of that app) their implementation of using the os provided PRNG was broken
[16:34:16] <Apachez> so their keys were clustered in like 4-5 areas (if you would plot all keys in a 0->1 graph)
