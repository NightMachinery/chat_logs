[03:10:17] <bookworm> syllin: that's if you are quieted (+q)
[03:10:40] <syllin> so i have +q, and having +q prevents me from seeing my mode?
[03:11:02] <bookworm> no, it prevents you from talking, that's why you saw the button with the tooltip

[03:11:51] <bookworm> usually that's because of a general +q on non identified nicks as a spam precaution... anything personal you'd know the reason ;)
[03:12:00] <syllin> lol
[03:12:21] <syllin> so do i have a per-channel mode attached to my user, that is separate from the channel's mode?
[03:13:44] <bookworm> you have user modes and then you have channel modes yes, https://libera.chat/guides/channelmodes

[03:15:32] <bookworm> user modes you can't actually look at in TL, do to a bug^wtodo in our upstream lib https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4234 but we're working on it
[03:18:45] <syllin> awesome, thanks
[03:20:45] <syllin> that MR is young! luckily someone had the same problem as me recently? i guess lots of usage spike since the leenode fiasco?

[21:43:14] <JohnDoe2> the issue is cyclical, every few hours, more than once per day
[21:43:39] <syllin> i noticed that i have logfiles in plaintext, but i also have a `myuser.mysql3` which is also pretty large. does the latter have chat logs as well?
[21:43:45] <JohnDoe2> so while "idling"
[21:48:08] <bookworm> syllin: yes, the sqlite db is what TL usesfor scrollback when you restart / scroll further than your max history
[21:48:44] <bookworm> you can turn one or both of them off in the config if you don't want that
[21:49:07] <bookworm> the text files are just for archiving, TL doesn't use them

[23:48:22] <Simon> is there some simple way to handle inactive users by getting the lounge to disconnect and stop auto-connecting until they login?
[23:48:56] <Simon> we have 10 nicknames still on "old freenode" because the users haven't connected in months and have forgotten about it
[23:50:47] <Simon> I think it would be useful to have some kind of configurable inactivity timeout to avoid leaving zombie clients running forever, but I don't see anything in the documentation for this
[23:52:08] <xnaas> It would be overly complicated, but in theory you could parse user's username.json files for last used timestamps
[23:52:52] <Simon> can I edit those to change freenode to libera and set them as disconnected?
[23:53:17] <Simon> it looks like there's a way to explicitly disconnect from a network until told to reconnect, that would apply even if the service is restarted?
[23:53:35] <xnaas> You can edit the connections in the files (thelounge restart required), I guess, but they'll autoconnect when thelounge starts back up.
[23:54:28] <xnaas> I'm pretty sure, anyway. I've never tested disconnecting from a network and then restarting thelounge to see what happens.
[23:54:35] <xnaas> But I'm pretty sure they'll autoconnect.
