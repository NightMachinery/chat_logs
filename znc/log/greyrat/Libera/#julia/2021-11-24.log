[00:39:59] <apteryx> nope, that's obsoleted
[00:40:26] <apteryx> seems 'make -jN' should do? but it doesn't.  and setting JULIA_CPU_THREADS doesn't help either, at least for the number of workers used to run the test suite
[00:49:15] <apteryx> Debian seems to use JULIA_CPU_CORES, although that's wrong per Julia's doc https://salsa.debian.org/julia-team/julia/-/commit/4812d3281d1ec2c241ab8d399030b87d5f658f28#9c96da0e9f91d7d8937b69b524702c106258f0d1

[02:05:25] <dTal> What's the best way of smoothly viewing high resolution images?
[02:06:10] <dTal> I've got 40 megapixels that I want to zoom, pan, and examine.

[02:38:17] <dTal> It didn't occur to me that saving them to disk would help.
[02:38:52] <dTal> If they were on disk, you'd just have to read them back into memory anyway.
[02:39:58] <dTal> What I want is basically imshow() from ImageView, but that doesn't suck.
[02:40:55] <dTal> Makie has image(), but that's even worse - I just get a blank white window, followed by memory exhaustion.
[02:42:52] <^[> If you save them to files, you can use any generic image viewer.
[02:44:01] <dTal> Saving to files is a big hassle.
[02:45:40] <dTal> But if there's nothing decent accessible from Julia, maybe that's the best way.
[02:46:57] <dTal> "Scientific" image visualization a la imshow() is usually a bit "magic" and convenient; it'll work on any data type, clamp ranges automatically, take color palette parameters etc
[02:47:50] <^[> PyPlot's interactive imshow is slow and clunky, but not unusably so.
[02:48:25] <dTal> and ideally allow you to probe the data in its original format - i.e., hover your mouse over a pixel and get the  value of the UInt16 that fed it, instead of having to convert to a better supported and possibly lossier format

[03:22:32] <mikko> in what way does imshow suck? maybe there's a way to improve that?
[03:50:48] <dTal> I'm finding it to be incredibly laggy.
