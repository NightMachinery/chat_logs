[14:00:22] <T`aZ> nice
[14:00:44] <T`aZ> still useless as nobody has time to maintain such behemoth drivers for free
[14:00:54] <T`aZ> it should come from the vendor
[14:04:25] <Renderwww> there probably would be drivers if nvidia wouldn't require signing or whatever crap they do
[14:05:07] <T`aZ> i insist on the aspect that it must come from the vendor itself, for big drivers
[14:06:10] <Carbonflux> if we had taken a different design path maybe we would not need drivers at all. Sometimes i think drivers are mostly there to prevent reverse eng.
[14:06:27] <T`aZ> look at amd state, it's already crap coming from the vendor itself, imagine if it was even less supported
[14:07:09] <Carbonflux> for a while it seemed like AMD was making an effort tho.
[14:07:47] <T`aZ> they suck at software, always have, always will
[14:08:38] <Renderwww> amd is perfect now because valve throws money at the drivers!
[14:08:39] <T`aZ> 25years and no sign of improvement
[14:08:56] <T`aZ> lol, valve is geatr in that aspect indeed

[14:09:54] <T`aZ> my future choice 
[14:10:17] <T`aZ> hassle free is worth less performances
[14:10:32] <Renderwww> amd drivers are better than intel ones
[14:13:14] <Carbonflux> heh
[14:13:29] <dukwon> what about women drivers?
[14:15:30] <Carbonflux> harharhar
[14:15:51] <Carbonflux> you could get canceled in some places for saying that.
