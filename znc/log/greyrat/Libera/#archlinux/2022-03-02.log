[01:43:40] <haritz> perhaps the problem is that the modules are being loaded after the initramfs tried to unlock the LUKS volume?
[01:43:45] <haritz> I mean, after it tries to do that
[01:44:14] <haritz> but that shouldn't be the case since the modules are written explicitly into MODULES
[01:44:16] <thurstylark> according to your mkinitcpio.conf, your hook ordering should be ok
[01:44:33] <Earnestly> BrainDamage: Speaking of calendar, look into remind(1) if you haven't already.  It's wonderful
[01:44:48] <haritz> it says 'SIOCFADDR no device' when trying to bring the interface up, then I'm left at a prompt to type the password of the LUKS volume
[01:44:58] <haritz> after that, I'm dropped into a prompt inside the initramfs
[01:45:11] <haritz> where I can clearly see the interface is right there, I give it an IP address, and then can ssh into i
[01:45:17] <thurstylark> is your device name correct in your ip parameter?
[01:45:21] <haritz> yes
[01:45:24] <haritz> eth0 all along
[01:45:26] <Earnestly> BrainDamage: The author has made videos on it, a bit like visidata, which is quite helpful because it's 33 year old pet project
[01:46:08] <thurstylark> haritz: hmm... can you give the `earlymodules` option a try? https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mkinitcpio#init_from_base_hook

[01:56:25] <haritz> another thing I've noticed is that right after the latest kernel update, my wlan interface is no longer visible

[04:43:19] <ttnk> hello, i made a vm with root partition encrypted and everytime it starts i have to put the password so it can start, is there a way to take the encryption from it so i dont have to put the password everytime?
[04:44:29] <Scotty_Trees> that's kind of the whole point of something being encrypted...
[04:44:53] <Namarrgon> ttnk: you can use cryptsetup-reencrypt to remove the encryption but make backups of important files first, it's easy to mess up

[15:25:17] <kek_> thrice, yeah I never build it manually, just reinstalled it. hmm, I'm not the best at it but  1-2h ago the update was rather big and it did involve the kernel and I think I never rebootet (can't remember, had to go away, so I guess I never did). Maybe that somehwo causes it?

[15:37:39] <kek_> MacGyver, I don't know enough about the underlying mechanism here to get to that conclusion. Thanks for pointing it out. So basically the application/service loses its conenction to the audio server because of the update?
[15:38:30] <MacGyver> kek_: That's what happens in the audio case, yes. I can't tell from just the error and your description it's actually complaining about the socket to pulse/pipewire there, or something in the bluetooth stack.

Arch image boots fine, for some reason, while the others give me a "Booting kernel failed: bad file number" error... The two differences between the images are the path size,
[19:27:35] <Baphomet> which I reduced but got no results, and the ISO image file size, Arch is 850M and the others are 1.9G and 2G

[19:54:18] <BitBiro> Archlinux Anywhere has had the same issue - it renamed to Anarchy Linux. But i am using ALG (Archlinux Gui) too. I want an installer - it saves me a lot of time especially installing new archlinux users a system
[19:54:23] <sandman13> Kind of offtopic but is there a way to limit application to just one workspace/virtual desktop while sharing screen? 
[19:56:18] <Khorne> Depends on the application I guess
[19:56:40] <Khorne> BitBiro, the question is why are you installing systems for other people in the first place :')
[19:56:46] <Khorne> They should do it themselves to know how it's setup
[19:57:12] <MrElendig> depends on the wm
[19:57:37] <BitBiro> Khorne - For familiy for example. I dont want to be bothered with Windows questions so i have no choice :D
[19:57:38] <MrElendig> BitBiro: arch comes with an installer
[19:57:45] <MrElendig> 3 different ones even

[19:57:58] <sandman13> Teams for Linux, Slack or Electron applications in general do not see workspace/tag/virtual desktop. I tried with KDE, i3wm and dwm
[19:58:24] <BitBiro> MrElendig Really ? A Gnome Liveboot for example with GUI install ?
[19:58:37] <MrElendig> pacstrap, archinstall, archboot

[19:59:28] <MrElendig> most gui installers are absolute trash :/
[19:59:28] <BitBiro> Yes - thats it. I mean text installs are good too but sometimes i want to dring coffee and just klick MrElendig :D

[19:59:40] <MrElendig> eg the fedora one
[19:59:41] <BitBiro> ALG is okay
[20:00:02] <MrElendig> but unsupported so if you use that you are on your own
[20:00:14] <Khorne> Boot iso, format the one disk on their laptop to have two partitions, create an esp and a /, mount, pacstrap everything, create a user, install systemd-boot, reboot, the end
[20:00:21] <Khorne> 10minutes, done, next
[20:00:47] <BitBiro> MrElendig yes i know but its nearly Archlinux vanilla - only removing the ALG repos - thats all
[20:01:20] <MrElendig> still not supported
[20:01:50] <Khorne> Are you also replacing all the software from their repos that now never gets updates
[20:01:51] <BitBiro> Maybe i should take a look at the default archlinux installers ...
[20:01:52] <Khorne> silly
[20:02:05] <BitBiro> Khorne yes i do
[20:02:23] <Khorne> Seems more effort than just installing Arch straight at that point, realistically
[20:02:44] <BitBiro> I have an own backup restore script which collects home data an all installed packages so its not a problem
[20:02:45] <Khorne> Do slightly more up front, or have cleanup after the fact

[23:46:06] <Strykar> how do I check which font my terminal is using?
[23:46:53] <damarusama> depends on the terminal emulator you are using
[23:47:04] *** Quits: ZeroV1p3r (~ZeroV1p3r@user/ZeroV1p3r) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:47:53] <damarusama> the one I use I can simply right click in it and go to the preference, other have a menu on top, while other have a config file where you set your font
[23:47:54] <Strykar> kitty
[23:48:39] <Strykar> I have set the fonts in the config and kitty loads it via xdg autostart, just wanted to check since there are diff fonts for italics and bold etc
