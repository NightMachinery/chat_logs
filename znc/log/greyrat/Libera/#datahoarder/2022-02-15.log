[07:33:47] <rmmh> evilgohan2: context?
[07:37:25] <evilgohan2> rmmh: Newegg has been, for lack of a better word and to call it exactly what it is, scamming people for the past few years.
[07:38:03] <evilgohan2> Selling "new", "Refurbished", and "open box" items that are damaged, and then denying RMAs for literally any reason you can think of.
[07:38:32] <evilgohan2> This has been particularly flagrant with CPUs and Motherboards - as bent pins are common
[07:38:33] <unfinity> ãƒ»ã‚œã‚œ â€‹ ãƒ»ã€‚ã€‚ãƒ»ã‚œã‚œ\_Ã¶â€‹< quackâ€‹!
[07:38:35] <evilgohan2> ,bef
[07:38:35] <unfinity> evilgohan2 you befriended a duck in 2.413 seconds! You have made friends with 209 ducks in #datahoarder.
[07:39:13] * Hydragyrum thermal pastes your cpu pins
[07:39:43] <evilgohan2> But, of course, most of the people affected were those who have little social media presence so they don't mean much to Newegg when they complain. After all, what's a customer gonna do? They already have their money and competition among storefronts isn't exactly high
[07:39:55] <evilgohan2> You pretty much have Newegg, Amazon, and *maybe* MicroCenter if you're in the USA
[07:40:16] <evilgohan2> Enter Steve (Gamer's Nexus)
[07:40:48] <evilgohan2> As part of a build, they were having trouble with a motherboard so they ordered one from Newegg that was $500 and apparently labeled Open Box.
[07:41:15] <evilgohan2> (or it might have been new and changed later to Open Box - which some people have alleged has happened to them)
[07:41:34] <evilgohan2> Steve never opened the box upon delivery. Actually, to that point, he never even opened the parcel.
[07:42:14] <evilgohan2> So the contents inside were never touched by Gamer's Nexus. As they didn't need it anymore ,they requested an RMA as "unused, not needed" which Newegg specifically has an option for and has had for years.
[07:42:34] <evilgohan2> Newegg receives it back and refuses the refund saying "customer damaged product"
[07:42:47] <evilgohan2> I reiterate: Gamer's Nexus never opened the box, nor the parcel that it was in
[07:43:10] <evilgohan2> Steve indicates this in a support chat. Newegg says "h/o"
[07:43:19] <evilgohan2> Newegg comes back and says they found thermal paste on the motherboard
[07:43:27] <evilgohan2> and that the pins are bent
[07:43:47] <evilgohan2> Steve demands photos. Newegg won't supply them. Steve demands to speak with someone via phone, they blow him off.
[07:43:57] <evilgohan2> yadda-yadda
[07:44:21] <evilgohan2> Steve gets frustrated and posts a video on YouTube titled "Newegg Scammed Us"
[07:44:38] <evilgohan2> and it's not clickbait. Like, what he's describing is *bad*
[07:44:43] <evilgohan2> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fnXsmXzphI <-- video in question
[07:45:34] <evilgohan2> The video starts making the rounds on social media. Suddenly, Newegg is all too happy to try to reach out to Steve (and I'm sure this has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that he's got 191k twitter followers and 1.58 million youtube subscribers)
[07:46:22] <evilgohan2> Steve at this point though is halfway through making another video documenting everything. See, at this point, Newegg corporate got involved and refunded the money, but they also had already sent back the motherboard as they refused the return initially.
[07:47:30] <evilgohan2> After a little investigation work (which is fully documented in the follow-up video), the motherboard in question had been previously damaged and sent by Newegg themselves back to Gigabyte for RMA. Gigabyte quoted $100 to repair, Newegg said "nah", and then restocked it as "Open Box"
[07:47:47] <evilgohan2> But they also left the existing RMA label on the motherboard
[07:47:49] <rmmh> evilgohan2: lmao thta's awesome
[07:48:31] <evilgohan2> That follow-up is here, and it pretty much went from "okay, maybe GN is being a little hyperbolic" to "Holy shit, Newegg is actually breaking the law here by scamming and defrauding people."
[07:48:35] <evilgohan2> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL-eB_Bv5Ik
[07:48:55] <Hydragyrum> incompetence, laziness, or corner-cutting to increase profits?
[07:48:56] <evilgohan2> Which gave affirmation to everything people had been claiming.
[07:49:39] <Hydragyrum> were they just trash at their jobs, did they give 0 fscks, or were they doing it on purpose, that's a somewhat important question here
[07:49:51] <evilgohan2> Probably a mix of all three - though it came up on the WAN show, and Linus threw another possibility on to that: employees who are possibly being "encouraged" (even if indirectly) to do so or have as low of a discard rate as possible.
[07:50:51] <evilgohan2> Since then, Newegg has been calling Gamer's Nexus incessently reportedly.
[07:51:22] <evilgohan2> But Gamer's Nexus at this point is like "we gave you the chance to talk and you blew us off so..."
[07:51:32] <evilgohan2> they're also collecting reports from other users now

[07:53:30] <evilgohan2> Anyway,you're all caught up rmmh
[07:53:49] <Hydragyrum> the big arse-covering response seems calculated to piss everyone off more lol
[07:54:12] <rmmh> evilgohan2: thanks!
[07:54:34] <evilgohan2> Hydragyrum: Oh it's 100% going over like a lead balloon
[07:54:37] <Hydragyrum> well I'm just glad I haven't bought anything from newegg
[07:54:48] <evilgohan2> Yeah, it's been years for me.
[07:54:59] <evilgohan2> At least 2016 ish
[07:55:14] <Hydragyrum> but I stg if their pr people were trying to sabatoge their image without looking like they're trying to, they couldn't do a better job than that message
[07:57:12] <evilgohan2> The other thing is that Newegg operates on what are frankly very slim margins business wise. If you have a guy with a subscriber base of 1.54 million whose videos get posted to Reddit, Twitter, etc. and referenced by other YouTubers such as LTT who has 14.3 million subscribers (and who just said they would do no business with Newegg for at least the next six months and then will reevaluate), 
[07:57:16] <rmmh> is B&H okay
[07:57:18] <evilgohan2> yeah... it's damage control time.
[07:57:42] <CharlesA> rmmh, I've used them in the past and it's been fine. I just bought a bunch of drives from them last week, too.
[07:57:53] <superkuh> https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5123794 "For 1Tb device the estimated mass change is 2.5 × 10^-25 Kg."
[07:58:02] <evilgohan2> B&H has... uh... long standing labor issues.
[07:58:08] <evilgohan2> and that's the nicest way that I can put that.
[07:58:12] <CharlesA> That's true ^
[07:58:26] <CharlesA> I found out about that while I was looking up the newegg stuff this morning.
[07:58:48] <CharlesA> Guess I was the lucky 10,000th today. :)

[13:43:47] <moo> why is it so hard to find a video doorbell that doesn't suck donkeys
[13:44:06] <moo> i just want it to record to my NAS and have a chime, and yet there is none
[13:57:10] <Snuupy> amcrest? haven't used it myself since I got the google nest doorbell for $50 a few black fridays ago
[14:18:40] <NeoThermic> moo, I _think_ anker have something like that
[14:23:26] <NeoThermic> ah, the store to NAS only is a thing on their cameras, not their doorbells
[14:23:43] <NeoThermic> but their cameras just expose RTSP, so you just save that as required

[22:03:12] <Nutcrawler> hey bros I'm looking for a disk dock, whats a good one without anything extra so its cheap?
[22:03:34] <Nutcrawler> preferably with two ports and USB 3.0 but I assume most have USB3 now
[22:06:16] <NeoThermic> I mean, why 3.0, why not something faster? :P
[22:07:07] <NeoThermic> https://www.startech.com/en-us/hdd/sdock2u313
[22:07:34] <Nutcrawler> I think my motherboard only has regular 3.0
[22:07:54] <NeoThermic> and you're going to keep that mobo for longer than the dock?

[22:08:16] *** Joins: Johannes1 (~Johannes@user/Johannes)
[22:08:51] <Nutcrawler> yeah I mean if two products are comparable and the only difference is usb3 and something better, I'd go with the one that could be utilized more later 
[22:10:03] <NeoThermic> the one I linked will probs be the best you can generally get, given the requirement
[22:11:17] <Nutcrawler> What benefits does that have over this one? They both say they support SATA III up to 6gbps
[22:11:17] <Nutcrawler> https://www.startech.com/en-us/hdd/sdock2u33
[22:12:14] <NeoThermic> so if you put two 2.5" SSDs in there and pull max from both, that one will bottleneck sooner
[22:12:43] <NeoThermic> whereas the 3.1Gen2 will bottleneck at 10Gbps vs 5Gb/s
[22:15:33] <NeoThermic> I'm so bummed that SATA Express didn't take
