[09:59:19] <svendre> I'm a little late to the party as most discussion of this looks to have taken place around 2019, but I just discovered Firefox normandy active (captured with a proxy), despite "surveys" off. This was reported as a bug, and dismissed a long time ago. It does not seem like this option for a backdoor to change config and certifications should be
[09:59:19] <svendre> permitted in debian.
[09:59:25] <svendre> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=928433
[09:59:26] <judd> Bug https://bugs.debian.org/928433 in firefox-esr (closed): «firefox-esr: app.normandy.enabled should default to false»; severity: important; opened: 2019-05-04; last modified: 2019-06-02.

[10:05:52] <somiaj>  You can reopen the bug if you have evidence you can provide to it. Though might almost be worth waiting until the new esr makes it to stable (though this could be a while)
[10:06:27] <somiaj> looks like you have to unarchive it first too
[10:07:53] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[10:10:39] <svendre> Sure, I could try that. The options of browsers that don't mess around in the background seems to be dwindling (or is impossible already). Geez, what's left. How's konquerer?
[10:11:21] <somiaj> I don't trust any webkit browers just due to less security support
[10:11:46] <svendre> so how do you browse?
[10:11:58] <somiaj> In the end they all suck, so choose your posion. Sandbox them, use tor, these are options.
[10:12:04] <svendre> surely you aren't using curl for everything lol
[10:12:47] <somiaj> I just use firefox and put my trust in mozilla. I don't agree with what they do, but most of it is out of my control

[10:33:42] <svendre> In case anyone is wondering what the heck I'm talking about, this is their strange page for the feature enabled by default in debian's Firefox ESR: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Normandy/PreferenceRollout
[10:35:56] <svendre> They don't tell you how to turn it off there, only in other places to make it seem like it's tied to other features (but it's independent) - very misleading. You have to:  open about:config -- toggle app.normandy.enabled to false -- sorry for going on about this, but this kind of thing really chars me.

[10:39:11] <somiaj> well irc maybe a good place to rant, but not much can be done about it here. You can unarchive/reopen the bug report see if debian disables it, or send this upstream to mozilla (though as I sated, might want to check out the sid firefox-esr package and see if it still has this issue)
[10:39:25] <somiaj> since currently they are working on backporting the build chain to backport firefox-esr 91

[11:00:13] <Jaami> how to get rif of permission denied while using terminal with root?
[11:01:05] <somiaj> !buster su
[11:01:05] <dpkg> Starting with buster, su no longer overrides PATH by default, requiring that you use "su -" or "su -l" for login shells (which is not really a new thing at all...). See https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster#Changes for details.
[11:01:34] <somiaj> Though that is more, 'command not found' than permission denied. Might want to paste some of the exact command and output you are getting, that was just a random guess
[11:02:57] <somiaj> use paste.debian.net or some pastebin for the output
[11:03:07] <Jaami> please see https://paste.debian.net/1223096/
[11:04:14] <somiaj> Probably an issue with npm vs just a root terminal, maybe share the output of the debug log it gives. But I don't know npm well enough to have any idea what is going on

[16:25:11] <abrotman> Have you tried without RAID to see if the issue lies there?
[16:25:16] * at0m reminds self of why he sticks to K.I.S.S. and avoids RAID
[16:25:21] <dka> I don't think it is necessary to redo the whole install guide, I did it like 8 times yesterday

[16:25:53] <dka> I can try, but what are the probability ? (sorry I have only one day to do that)
[16:26:12] <abrotman> you can also switch to the console to perhaps inspect why grub is failing

[16:30:33] <at0m> in the GUI installer, Ctrl-Alt-F5 takes you back to the GUI iirc
[16:31:11] <at0m> you can get a root shell in either of those TTY's even during the installation, and do your thing there
[16:31:22] <dka> I'll have a try thanks :), now copying to drive with  dd if=/home/dka/Downloads/firmware-11.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso of=/dev/sda bs=4M

[16:33:44] <dka> ;s
[16:33:50] <dka> I kept forgotting to sync yesterday and it did boot
[16:33:56] <dka> why sync ?
[16:33:59] <dka> Should I start over xD
[16:34:08] <at0m> sync flushes out caches to disks
[16:34:12] <at0m> disks/drives
[16:34:28] <dka> SO it should be ok without it?
[16:34:37] <dka> I am trying one install without it
[16:34:44] <dka> because it's already installing :)
[16:34:51] <at0m> if you wait long enough it will flush the cache eventually. sync forces such flush
[16:35:01] <at0m> yea all cool
[16:35:38] <rawtaz> whats that firmware iso for? i always just used the regular netboot iso
[16:36:02] <at0m> rawtaz: it has non-free firmware. say, for some realtek network controllers
[16:36:07] <rawtaz> oh right
[16:36:09] <rawtaz> :)
[16:36:12] <at0m> or wifi etc
[16:36:15] <dka> if you hhave a WWAN, Webacam or a WIFI card, which does not have open source direver, they mostely will be available in the non free repo
[16:36:27] <dka> direver = driver

MAybe they close old RFP bugs if no one steps up since projects can die and not be needed. Also could be a library not needed by other things in debian.

[21:36:00] <maxzor> If I understood correctly, it is currently statically linked by chrome, firefox, libreoffice... and is 500MB
[21:36:44] <Khepra> Is that even intended for linux... no mention of linux here  https://skia.org/docs/user/build/
[21:36:57] *** Joins: SanchoPiensa (~me@089144207217.atnat0016.highway.bob.at)
[21:37:04] <Khepra> GNU/Linux I mean
[21:37:53] <maxzor> it surely builds, I did it yesterday here on ubuntu 20.04, was not THAT hard. The only issue, that I found, is that the vulkan backend *seems* to need proprietary GPU drivers : https://bugs.chromium.org/p/skia/issues/detail?id=12736&sort=-id
[21:38:50] <Khepra> maxzor: does it build on debian?
[21:39:36] <maxzor> I'll fire up a bullseye VM, but can't see why it wouldn't
[21:40:02] <Khepra> why are you asking here then?
[21:40:35] <maxzor> what do you mean?
[21:40:57] <somiaj> also are you sure that the debian packages for firefox/libreoffice/chomrium actually enable this libary, could be that it just isn't used in debian's packages despite being used upstream.
[21:41:16] <Khepra> maxzor: I thought you were asking why it wasn't packged for debian
[21:41:31] <Khepra> and the question was does it even build, given required dependencies
[21:42:51] <maxzor> no I am not sure at all somiaj, that's what I asked first, if you knew why this library seemingly central to modern 2D was not packaged. Maybe does firefox have a cairo backend or something, I have no clue
[21:44:18] <somiaj> Unfourntally the only info I found is the RFC bug which was closed. Debian policy doesn't like static linked/bundeled libaries, so the fact it was closed and not built might mean it isn't needed for Debian. Though I can't give a definitive answer
[21:45:03] <Khepra> and that said, can it even be used in firefox unless it's part of the upstream source tarball?
[21:45:26] <somiaj> though the firefox-esr changelog metnions gfx/skia/... a bit, it could be something that isn't mean to be standa alone?
[21:47:23] <somiaj> It seems it comes as part of the firefox source, and maybe there is little insentitive to modify the source and make it use a shared libarary
[21:48:43] *** Parts: vxwarlock (~Darkcodex@user/vxwarlock) (Closing Window)
[21:50:31] <maxzor>  it is in chromium sources aswell, so it ends up in qt sources...
[21:51:28] <maxzor> in atom, vscode, ... you know the drill
[21:52:26] <maxzor> it can compile as so, trying on the vm
[21:52:27] <somiaj> yea, this does seem unstandard, but it seems all upstreams are bundeling the source already, and it would require a lot of work for debian to extract it, remove it from all the upstream sources and turn it into a shared library (this is providing they even all use a compadiable version)

[23:01:12] <somiaj> for the most part nothing
[23:01:37] <somiaj> though if you have any auto-installed packages that are held in by that package, it will let you know and you can then remove them with apt autoremove
[23:01:47] <somiaj> though I assume most are held in by task-destkop-foo

[23:03:26] <somiaj> the command you wrote wont, if you autoremove afterwards, answer is 'it depends'
[23:03:41] <bae> ha ha
[23:03:51] <somiaj> Though I don't think it will because task-desktop-foo will still be manually installed holding things in
[23:04:16] <somiaj> No one can know what packages you have manually installed or set to manual. Though what is your goal?
[23:04:33] <somiaj> really keeping meta packages installed causes no harm, so just removing that package really doesn't do much (direclty)
[23:05:01] <bae> My goal is to completely remove my x window system, and all software that runs on it.
[23:05:26] <somiaj> then you want to remove a bit more core of a package that everything depnds on.
[23:05:57] <somiaj> removing xserver-xorg-core should get remove most things
[23:06:21] <bae> can I use tasksel to remove it all?
[23:06:44] <somiaj> removing libx11-6 would take out even more things, though there are often console tools that depend on this small lib (due to they can be run in console or X), so you may take out too much removing that package
[23:06:48] <somiaj> no, tasksel doesn't do that
[23:06:58] <bae> 'taskel remove desktop'?
[23:07:07] <somiaj> tasksel is just a simple tool ot install metapackages
[23:07:23] <bae> It can also remove metapackages
[23:07:33] <somiaj> Sure, but removing metapackages doesen't really do anything
[23:07:46] <bae> Why?
[23:07:57] <somiaj> Because of how metapackages work
[23:07:58] <Kobaz> in /etc/logrotate.d/apache2 -- I have: postrotate    chroot /ycfg-provisioning apache2ctl graceful         ---- any idea why that wouldn't execute properly?
[23:08:23] <somiaj> metapackages just depend on other things and pull in dependencies, but removing them wont' do much, since nothing really depends on them.

[23:08:59] <somiaj> Removing a package will only remove things that depend on it (not things it depends on). Autoremove will kinda do what you want, the problem is 'it depends' based on other packages you installed and what is marked as manual vs automatic.
[23:09:24] <bae> OK...that explains why someone piped the output from tasksel that gave all desktop dependencies, into 'apt purge'
[23:09:29] <somiaj> Though if you want to remove xorg and stuff that depends on it, take out xserver-xorg-core, it will take most of xorg with it (though since desktops also depend on wayland)
[23:09:51] <bae> I'm on xfce

[23:50:36] <bae> OK, maybe this is an easier question. How can I change my configuration so that my computer boots into a console login, instead of the graphical login screen?
[23:52:01] <bae> I was going to remove xserver-xorg-core, but I'm afraid my system won't know what to do when I boot it up again.
[23:52:29] <tomreyn> you want to change the systemd default target

[23:52:48] <somiaj> use multi-user.target as default instead of graphical.target

[23:53:02] <bae> tomreyn: How do I do that? What file?
[23:53:24] <tomreyn> systemctl set-default multi-user.target
[23:53:42] <bae> thnx :-)
[23:53:53] <tomreyn> you're welcome
[23:53:54] <bae> systemctl is awesome
[23:56:30] <Khepra> if you need it temporarily, you can set it on grub cmdline:   systemd.unit=multi-user.target
