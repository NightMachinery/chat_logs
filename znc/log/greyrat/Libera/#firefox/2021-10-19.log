[00:25:56] <dalias> yep
[00:26:37] <dalias> in some ways i'm for the "just wrap apps you can't trust not to have malware and run the provided binaries as-is" approach, but NOT for a browser
[00:27:11] <dalias> because a browser is like an OS component -- it mediates your interaction with all sorts of other parties
[00:27:53] <dalias> the threat from it having malware is not harming the outside host system, but harming your privacy in the very things you're using it for

[17:29:57] <MJCD> the bar fills with gmail.com as it's the first result in my history/whatever logic it uses
[17:30:03] <MJCD> most visited
[17:30:27] <MJCD> firefox shows gmail as the first result after typing two letters "gm"
[17:30:36] <MJCD> but I have to go down the list or click it
[17:31:21] <MJCD> and because that's how I expect it to work I keep google searching for gm after seeing gmail as the first result
[17:31:32] <MJCD> er duckduckgo'ing
[17:31:51] <MJCD> but that parts no problem as I say even if there's maybe a hotkey for "go to first result in list below"

[17:37:15] <Guest15> Hi all. Dunno if you can help but (I think) I'm having an issue with Firefox and HSTS. I've set up HSTS on a local test domain and accessed the site via HTTPS. If I then try and access the same page via HTTP, Firefox loads it just fine which I expected it not to do. If I try the same in Chrome, Chrome properly redirects me to the HTTPS version. Am
[17:37:16] <Guest15> I correct in thinking the Firefox behaviour is incorrect, and if so, does anyone have any ideas why this is happening?
[17:38:05] <phy1729> What's the expiration time on the HSTS header and are you in incog mode?
[17:38:35] <MJCD> Guest15: sounds like a httpd config thing not a firefox thing
[17:38:49] <Guest15> phy1729: ten minutes for testing purposes and no not in incognito mode.
[17:40:00] <Guest15> I can see the header coming back in the responses served via HTTPS but I can also then make the exact same request via HTTP and Firefox lets it go through just fine...
[17:41:13] <MJCD> firefox doesn't "let it" go through just fine
[17:41:24] <MJCD> there's no problem as far as firefox cares if it's http or https
[17:41:32] <MJCD> there are extensions that can force https
[17:41:55] <MJCD> though again it sounds like you should just configure your httpd to deny non-ssl connections :)
[17:42:07] <MJCD> which you can find out to do in whatever softwares channel
[17:42:10] <MJCD> ie #apache
[17:42:11] <Guest15> MJCD: Unless I'm missing something, this is the whole point of HSTS. The browser should *not* allow HTTP requests on a HSTS domain.
[17:43:40] <MJCD> it is not.
[17:43:47] <MJCD> As per the wikipedia; "A server implements an HSTS policy by supplying a header over an HTTPS connection (HSTS headers over HTTP are ignored)"
[17:44:07] <MJCD> you still need to deny the connection on your httpd if that's how you want it to behave
[17:44:25] <Guest15> To quote the same page... "The way this protection works is that a user entering or selecting a URL to the site that specifies HTTP, will automatically upgrade to HTTPS, without making an HTTP request, which prevents the HTTP man-in-the-middle attack from occurring."
[17:44:43] <MJCD> there's no hsts header in the INITIAL ie pageload request
[17:44:47] <MJCD> er response
[17:44:58] <MJCD> and even if there is it's ignored
[17:45:00] <Guest15> ... I don't think you understand.
[17:46:08] <MJCD> HSTS has /no impact/ when you DIRECTLY access SPECIFICALLY http://
[17:46:21] <Guest15> I load Firefox. I visit https://mytestsite.test. I receive a HSTS header. I attempt to visit http://mytestsite.test. I believe the behaviour as per the spec, and as per Chrome, is that this connection should be upgraded to HTTPS.
[17:46:51] <MJCD> lol you receive that header for that request....
[17:46:58] <MJCD> they're not cookies...
[17:47:01] <MJCD> they're not stateful.
[17:47:18] <Guest15> ... once a HSTS header is received the browser should store that information.
[17:47:37] <MJCD> let's look at this from another angle
[17:47:39] <Guest15> It would literally offer zero protection if it didn't.
[17:47:41] <MJCD> if you do the same in Chrome
[17:47:45] <MJCD> does the same thing happen?
[17:47:55] <MJCD> and yes, it does offer "protection"
[17:47:57] <Guest15> No, it upgrades the connection to HTTPS as I'd expect.
[17:48:49] <MJCD> :shruggle:
[17:50:48] <dalias> mjcd, you're wrong here
[17:51:02] <dalias> HSTS is stateful and prevents any future non-https access
[17:51:16] <dalias> that's the *whole point* of it
[17:52:13] <MJCD> it's certainly not the whole point when direct access is attempted
[17:52:27] <Guest15> ... it is
[17:52:28] <dalias> yes it is
[17:52:28] <MJCD> but I can't explain why the behavior differs
[17:52:41] <MJCD> perhaps dalias can assist you further

[17:58:21] <dalias> or are you clicking thru on a self-signed one?
[17:58:26] <Guest15> It's old but this does match my scenario: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=902884
[17:59:09] <dalias> that says self-signed
[17:59:15] <dalias> a self-signed cert is not a valid cert
[17:59:20] <dalias> it's you performing an override
[17:59:24] <Guest15> Yeah, the certificate is self-signed. I think I'll give it a go with a self-signed and trusted root.
[17:59:36] <dalias> that's your problem
[17:59:53] <dalias> firefox will not accept and pin hsts for a cert that's not actually valid
[18:00:06] <Guest15> Well, it is a valid certificate, just not signed by a trusted root :p
[18:00:11] <dalias> because you might have been tricked into clicking thru from a mitm attack
[18:00:28] <dalias> that's not the definition of valid in use here :)
[18:01:01] <Guest15> Fair enough. I'll generate a self-signed root and issue the certificate from there and give it a go.
[18:01:08] <dalias> the tracker link you just pasted explains why it''s not supported
[18:01:15] <dalias> seriously just get a valid cert
[18:01:21] <dalias> this is 2021; LE exists :)
[18:01:53] <Guest15> The domain in question isn't public
[18:02:44] <dalias> then of course you can't pin HSTS for it because you don't own it :-)
[18:02:50] <dalias> it's potentially someone else's domain :-p
[18:03:06] <Guest15> It's under a reserved TLD :p

[18:04:15] <phy1729> (though if you throw enough money ICANN's way)
[18:04:42] <phy1729> the browser has no way of knowing this context is ok and not a MITM
[18:05:07] <dalias> and you dont even have to publish it in public dns (except the DNS-01 acme challenge TXT record)
[18:05:29] <Guest15> Yes, I now understand that's why the behavior is differing between Firefox & Chrome
[18:05:30] <dalias> other than that you can just run the zone privately on your internal network
[18:08:32] <MJCD> just use certbot/letsencrypt

[23:23:29] *** Joins: nckx (~nckx@tobias.gr)
[23:23:51] <mefistofeles> and the other thing is that, well... yes, firefox has changed some of its "good" policies, but it has been forced to do that for the most part. We already know Mozilla and firefox are struggling to get some relevant market share and keep the project going, so they have to sacrifice some things in order to keep having a product at all.
[23:24:36] <mefistofeles> it's not something Mozilla/Firefox planned, it is just something that the market asks for, sadly. Most people these days don't care about neutrality or privacy online
[23:25:04] <mefistofeles> and this fact gives browsers/institutions that abuse that an edge... others that do care, have to adapt or perish

[23:28:03] <krux02> I am trying to control firefox externally as my documentation browser
[23:28:30] <krux02> this means I send a lot of links to firefox, currently all of them open a new tab, which is almost never what I want
[23:29:05] <krux02> is there a way to open a link in firefox without opening a new tab?
[23:29:46] <krux02> best would be, if I can get a tab id (or handle) that I can pass to firefox to specify in which tab firefox should open the link in.
[23:32:13] <BaronVladimirHar> <mefistofeles> "and this fact gives browsers/..." <- They will perish.
[23:32:45] <BaronVladimirHar> I installed epiphany-browser so Debian would quit complaining about there not being a browser and trying to uninstall "gnome"'s metapackage and the X11 server when I removed Firefos-ESR.
[23:33:24] <mefistofeles> krux02: so you want to replace current opened tabs? Sounds a bit dangerous
[23:33:25] <BaronVladimirHar> Some people were talking about making a dummy package that said it provides Chromium, but Epiphany is only about 2 MB since the bulk of the browser is WebkitGTK, which is there anyway as part of GNOME.
[23:34:10] <BaronVladimirHar> I don't even want Firefox on my computer at this point, and Debian is a long way from having the keylogger malware, due to the fact that it'll bring in Firefox 91 ESR next, where the code wasn't there.

[23:34:31] <mefistofeles> BaronVladimirHar: interesting, you show this article that's basing its arguments on just relation with this companies and you choose to use WebKit which is developed by Apple :)
[23:34:31] <BaronVladimirHar> So we're about 2 years off, and I wouldn't be surprised if there's either no Mozilla by that point or they're down to 1 or 1.5% of web users.
[23:35:01] <mefistofeles> that said, nothing wrong with webkit, I just find it curious
[23:35:04] <BaronVladimirHar> There's no DRM blobs and spyware in WebkitGTK like there is in Firefox.
[23:35:26] <BaronVladimirHar> WebkitGTK is 100% open source software. Firefox is proprietary with backdoors.
[23:36:07] <BaronVladimirHar> At this point, Firefox is even bigger spyware than Chrome, because it's not only leaking your keystrokes to Google, but also to Mozilla, and BuySellAds.
[23:36:30] <mefistofeles> BaronVladimirHar: I don't agree, it's not like that, it is pretty complicated. But feel free to use whatever you want. No worries.
[23:36:57] <BaronVladimirHar> Then Mozilla gets caught lying in their Firefox package description. They say they don't collect data, track you, or share or sell data with third parties in the Firefox 93 Flatpak descriptor. 
[23:37:11] <BaronVladimirHar> But then in their reply to Bleeping Computer, they admitted that Firefox 93 does all of that.
[23:37:52] <BaronVladimirHar> Every release brings in something new and malicious to turn off.
[23:38:22] <mefistofeles> it is complicated :) Google and specially Apple also claims they don't track you, and they have won SEVERAL law suits against that
[23:38:30] <mefistofeles> tracking is a pretty complex thing
[23:38:34] <BaronVladimirHar> People won't react well to this. Then next time Firefox has to go negotiate for search royalties, they'll be worth less.
[23:38:41] <BaronVladimirHar> Then revenue will go down anyway.
[23:39:02] <mefistofeles> BaronVladimirHar: yes, probably, again, feel free to leave and use whatever you want.
[23:39:22] <BaronVladimirHar> It's sort of like taxes. You set them too high and people start figuring out ways to evade them because it wasn't worth doing before, but it is now.
[23:39:36] <mefistofeles> if you have issues with the flatpak package or the official releases I suggest you raise them in the Mozilla bugtracker
[23:39:45] <mefistofeles> talking about it here doesn't really help anyone
[23:40:01] <BaronVladimirHar> They even lie about it being off by default and opt-in.
[23:40:09] <BaronVladimirHar> Everyone who has commented says it was on and they were never asked.
[23:40:57] <BaronVladimirHar> I'm more likely to file a bug on Debian asking how in the hell this could be compliant with DFSG.
[23:41:32] <BaronVladimirHar> It hasn't been for a while now due to Google's Widevine blob. To be DFSG compliant, they'd have to patch out the option to even turn it on, and that would mean removing Mozilla's trademarks again.
[23:42:04] <BaronVladimirHar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines#The_guidelines
[23:42:20] <BaronVladimirHar> Unless they can explain how a DRM blob from Google complies with all of this.
[23:43:18] <BaronVladimirHar> Being DRM, it can't possibly comply with at least 2/3rds of that.
[23:44:09] <BaronVladimirHar> If their position is that the DFSG should be thrown out because DRM makes watching Netflix easier, what's next?
[23:45:02] <BaronVladimirHar> Widevine doesn't even work.
[23:45:27] <BaronVladimirHar> They release something with Widevine, it's everywhere right away, and they know it, and that's why they cap it at 720p.
[23:46:31] <BaronVladimirHar> Also, now that Widevine is there, fingerprinters, which Firefox claims to protect you from, call it to see if it's there or not, and what DRM blob gets loaded.
[23:46:41] <BaronVladimirHar> I've found them attempting to do this on Reddit and Fox News.
[23:47:21] <krux02> mefistofeles, what? No I don't want to replace all opened tabs, why are you talking about dangerous? Do you think my computer would explode?
[23:47:41] <mefistofeles> krux02: no, jsut dangerous in a way that it could replace some tab that you actually want
[23:47:52] <mefistofeles> krux02: but I don't know of a way to accomplish what you want, tbh
[23:48:32] <krux02> yea, that might happen, but I only want to replace one tab. And when I replace a tab by accident, I can still hit the back button, don't I?
[23:49:13] <krux02> or maybe a single tab instance of firefox, that always opens a new link in the same window and tab
[23:49:24] <krux02> without support for new tabs
[23:50:13] <BaronVladimirHar> I was considering making a fork that just patches all of this stuff out but the question becomes of where to host it.
[23:51:05] <krux02> the setup is pretty simple, there is firefox open on one screen, it is always there doesn't move. And I want to control what this browser does from another application
[23:51:07] <BaronVladimirHar> From what I've seen, the other derivatives are either broken as all hell (Pale Moon/Goanna is not a solution) or owned by an advertising company (Waterfox).
[23:51:57] <mefistofeles> krux02: maybe this helps https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-app-mode/ 
[23:52:38] <BaronVladimirHar> Actually, at the rendering engine level, WebkitGTK is more privacy-focused than Gecko.
[23:53:00] <krux02> mefistofeles, from my understanding that add on does the exact opposite of what I want
[23:53:02] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla has been blindly copying APIs that are from Chrome and are of limited use to legitimate web developers, which Webkit has refused to implement.
[23:53:07] <krux02> I don't want new stuff to open
[23:53:48] <BaronVladimirHar> Most of the Chromium browsers not from Google are disabling FLoC , Midi, Web Bluetooth, the Idle API, and others.
[23:53:58] <BaronVladimirHar> Firefox has them on.
[23:54:11] <BaronVladimirHar> All except FLoC, which I don't think they've implemented.
[23:54:26] <krux02> ok i am a bit more specific in what I want.
[23:54:39] <BaronVladimirHar> But it's sort of odd when you browse and all of a sudden a site requests to detect your bluetooth devices, or use the MIDI API.
[23:54:57] <krux02> one screen shows my text editor (emacs) and one screen shows my browser (firefox). I click on a symbol in emacs, firefox shows the documentation of it.
[23:54:59] <krux02> works
[23:55:09] <krux02> but firefox has in no time 100 tabs open
[23:55:14] <krux02> I want it to not do that
[23:55:18] <krux02> just stay at one tab
[23:55:22] <krux02> how do I do that?
[23:56:03] <krux02> and no 100 firefox open with each one tab is no solution
[23:58:12] <BaronVladimirHar> krux02: That's impressive given how much RAM is manages to waste despite not having a true multi-process model.
