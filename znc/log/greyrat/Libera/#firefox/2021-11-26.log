[00:41:59] <ede> do i have to unpack the mysql, change the text, then rebuild it?
[00:44:01] <ede> i wanted to make tags of the form X::Y. so i created A::B and wanted to add A::C, made an error, now i have one "A::B A:C". and it seems IMPOSSIBLE to remove or change it.

[01:01:15] <ede> oh nice. restarting helps.
[01:01:38] <ede> so after a few hours firefox brakes.
[01:02:13] <ede> i should check which of the old windows jokes could be transfered to it

[19:45:13] <intrac> eeesh
[19:47:30] <intrac> so work has been done on a set of themes - then they time limit it for no practical reason.
[19:59:21] <ede> intrac: they must come up with something new.

[20:04:38] <intrac> it feels like things are rotting at Mozilla towers if stuff like this is going on
[20:04:45] <ede> nothing to fix here, they WANT it like that
[20:04:46] <intrac> and I'm rarely this blunt, even on IRC
[20:05:06] <ede> coyping the crap from windows UI to Linux. really makes sense.
[20:05:19] <ede> but to be fair, GTK is worse than windows ever was.
[20:05:36] <intrac> isn't this also specific to Windows/Mac browser URL selection?
[20:05:42] <ede> firefox needs a reboot
[20:05:56] <intrac> how does selection work in MS Word?
[20:06:01] <intrac> I haven't used it in ages
[20:06:02] <ede> some org should fork it and give the devs a good reason to switch over.
[20:06:21] <ede> i new someone with... problems some years ago.
[20:06:25] <intrac> I would have thought single click moves cursor, double click selects word, triple click selects line/para
[20:06:37] <ede> can remember telling her to change sth in a URL and it took forever. asked her why.
[20:06:37] <intrac> ede: yes, it needs some direction
[20:06:59] <ede> "when i click into the address line everything is blue and when i start to type the text disappears."
[20:07:21] <intrac> I occasionally watch over my parents shoulder and have seen their frustration on 'single click to select everything'
[20:07:23] <intrac> exactly this
[20:07:42] <intrac> they want to put the cursor at the end of a search box, to add a search term
[20:07:46] <ede> btw, i have BorlandC++ 4.0 here and the help system had parts of MS docs, including some of their UI guidelines.
[20:07:56] <intrac> look down at the keyboard, start typing. the whole lot gets overwritten
[20:08:01] <ede> 25-30 years ago things weren't bad in theory at least...
[20:08:24] <ede> GTK is Windows for Linux.
[20:08:36] <ede> only with a really horrible design.
[20:08:56] <ede> and the bits Mozilla adds to Firefox makes it even worse.
[20:09:08] <intrac> I still haven't got used to their stripped down designs
[20:09:14] <ede> like i don't even have a bookmark button anymore. it's just gone.
[20:09:26] <intrac> eg, file open/save dialog with horrible path selection
[20:09:33] <ede> i have a full width tab bar, above menu with buttons and search
[20:09:52] <ede> have to use C-d to bookmark and then be fast because it disappears within seconds.
[20:10:00] <ede> yeah
[20:10:39] <ede> i can't even say how often i saved into the wrong directory or with the wrong filename because i wanted to switch and clicked a filename instead of a directory.

[20:12:47] <intrac> a lot of the options are put under the triple-bar menu button
[20:12:57] <intrac> just to add another layer you need to click to
[20:13:05] <intrac> and be less discoverable
[20:13:19] <ede> this idiocy was something Word came with in X or what it was. mix of menu and buttons and lists.
[20:13:26] <ede> looks like a junkyard.
[20:14:05] <ede> btw i'd really like to search from the urlbar. only they'd have to implement a sane method first.
[20:14:11] <intrac> I think UI design reached its zenith about 15 years ago
[20:14:20] <ede> and i don't see anything sane in what they did over the last decade ort so.
[20:14:20] <intrac> then it's been excuses to introduce new stuff for the sake of it
[20:15:10] <ede> yeah, now it's all minimalistic. text grey in grey, most of the time designed for 60“, with some of it for a phone.
[20:15:32] <ede> and then Material. i can't even imagine what an icon may be half of the time.
[20:15:51] <intrac> and on Android, there's sometimes no way to tell if a text menu item leads to a submenu, or just actions something
[20:15:59] <ede> too often looks like something a 8yrs old would create with pen&paper.
[20:17:04] <ede> oh, sumbenus. in that /// menu i can click the angle to open them or the text. to get back i MUST click the small angle in the top left corner.
[20:17:28] <intrac> what is this /// ?
[20:17:29] <ede> let widgets look like what they are, simple rule.
[20:17:35] <ede> that odd corner menu
[20:17:45] <ede> with the junkyard mix of items
