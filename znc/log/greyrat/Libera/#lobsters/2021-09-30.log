[00:00:12] <imode> that's true, but imagine it's currently dark out due to rain 'n stuff.

[00:02:29] <imode> there is no "theme".
[00:02:38] <iDrougge> Why not?
[00:02:46] <imode> because i3 doesn't have the concept of themes.
[00:02:53] <iDrougge> Why not?
[00:03:05] <imode> because themes are not a universal concept to various window managers.
[00:03:10] <iDrougge> Why not?
[00:03:20] <imode> because we have no idea how to do universal interfaces.

[00:04:02] <iDrougge> I didn't know i3 was a Xerox invention. I thought it was some Arch thing.
[00:04:12] <imode> i3 is a generic window manager, not specific to arch.
[00:04:13] <cot> It's not specific to Arch at all.
[00:04:20] <imode> and it's definitely not from xerox lol.

[01:15:21] <iDrougge> Because we've built our entire world on a language written in ten days.
[01:15:56] <imode> I'm building my entire world on a language with six commands or less.
[01:16:09] <moony> which one would that be. FORTH?
[01:16:49] <imode> nah, a BF-derivative that reduces the complexity of its operations by allowing inserts between cells.
[01:17:19] <moony> ....huh
[01:17:35] <imode> small, compact, trivially JITable.
[01:17:56] <imode> trivially compileable to and from a lot of languages.

[01:24:09] <moony> probably as slow as a potato sinking in molasses
[01:25:07] <imode> why would it, you can JIT it pretty easily.
[01:25:34] <moony> You're gonna need a pretty exceptional JIT for that, but I guess so

[01:26:41] <imode> the optimizations you make aren't that hard. it's not even that difficult to make a fast base interpreter without them.
[01:27:25] <imode> at some level everything requires some similar work, but the difference between Ruby's VM(s) and a BF interpreter is that you could write a low or high spec one in like, a weekend, and just go up from there.

[01:27:51] <imode> what impresses me about tritium is that it makes a pretty coherent go of compiling BF to C.
[01:28:06] <ignaloidas> eh, building up is a lot harder than building down
[01:28:17] <imode> amen.
[01:28:21] <companion_cube> imode:  do you have benchmarks though?
[01:28:23] <companion_cube> before trashing wasm :)
[01:28:39] <ignaloidas> recognising that something is addition is harder that decomposing addition into something else
[01:28:42] <imode> companion_cube: there have been benchmarks, lemme see if I can pull 'em up.
[01:29:04] <imode> though I guess it'd depend on what backend you're using?
[01:29:47] <moony> Yea, my experience with compilation stuff is basically exactly what ignaloidas said
[01:29:53] <moony> decomposing things is easier than recomposing them
[01:30:21] <moony> the optimal way to perform recomposition basically would be something like egraphs and many rewrite rules at the problem
[01:30:24] <ignaloidas> and since basically every processor knows how to do addition it's better to know that something is addition rather that getting to figure out that something is addition
[01:30:30] <moony> which is so horribly expensive uh
[01:30:31] <moony> good luck
[01:30:52] <imode> granted, yet IMO adding that information isn't exactly difficult.
[01:31:12] <ignaloidas> moony, yeah, I once looked at llvm code for optimising various popcount implementations into a single instruction, and god is that a lot of mess
[01:31:29] <imode> you either have to infer or you have to have hints.
[01:31:29] <ignaloidas> imode, no, it is, very very very much difficult
[01:31:55] <ignaloidas> if you're gonna have hints, why compile into low level stuff anyways?
[01:31:58] <moony> if you're adding hints you've basically just turned it back into what it originally was

[01:33:41] <imode> guess it depends on what you want to hint on. and I think that there's a large difference beween recognizing patterns in "fully featured IRs" and BF. there's a reason that you can whip something like tritium out, and why many optimizing BF compilers/JITs/interpreters exist.

[01:34:30] <companion_cube> so like, BF JITs try to decompile patterns for addition and the likes?
[01:34:51] <imode> yeah, pretty much.
[01:35:22] <companion_cube> seems fun, but also, a lot of work just to catch up with the very basic stuff in other languages
[01:35:24] <imode> I can't for the life of me find those tritium marks.. I think they were in a twitter thread, and I don't have twitter.
[01:35:30] <companion_cube> it's like Haskell
[01:35:31] <ignaloidas> bf is fairly easy to reason about at least, should be able to quite easily prove each optimization with an SAT
[01:35:43] <imode> that's the idea.
[01:35:44] <companion_cube> compilers have to work super hard to get back to where other languages are from the start, because of the lazyness
[01:35:52] <ignaloidas> now I want to see a SAT compiler for BF
[01:36:08] <imode> I was shocked how common writing a BF compiler was.
[01:36:23] <ignaloidas> something like a https://github.com/google/souper
[01:36:24] <mockturtle> [ GitHub - google/souper: A superoptimizer for LLVM IR ] - github.com
[01:36:57] <imode> companion_cube: I wouldn't say "catching up". you don't have to fight hard to see a lot of the patterns or do the optimizations. a lot of these are done by single individuals.
[01:37:18] <companion_cube> but then you reach a point that others still ahve to do 0 effort to be at
[01:37:27] <companion_cube> it's still more work overall
[01:37:38] <imode> I mean, what effort.
[01:38:01] <ignaloidas> finding all the ways how people think of writing popcount?
[01:38:05] <imode> lol.
[01:38:08] <companion_cube> :D yeah
[01:38:14] <companion_cube> popcount is annoying
[01:39:02] <moony> Compilers tend to boil down to extremely powerful pattern matchers/transformers
[01:39:15] <imode> that IMO is still worth it, because again, there's not many idioms. the structure of a BF program is pretty simple.
[01:39:16] <moony> and LLVM's popcount recognition is a good example of that fact
[01:39:36] <ignaloidas> here's how llvm detect popcount btw https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/f36485f7ac2a8d72ad0e0f2134c17fd365272285/lib/Transforms/Scalar/LoopIdiomRecognize.cpp#L960

[01:40:15] <moony> check codidact as well
[01:40:18] <companion_cube> imode: my point is just that you'd save the effort by starting with better than BF
[01:40:26] <moony> a good chunk of the old CGSE moved there
[01:40:41] <imode> companion_cube: I mean, sure, but your goals aren't mine. :)
[01:40:48] <companion_cube> indeed not
[01:40:50] <companion_cube> neither our tastes :)
[01:41:11] <imode> moony: curious, why the move?
[01:41:15] <imode> SE moderation?
[01:41:28] <moony> SE moderation. The issue actually happened back in like 2018ish
[01:41:33] <imode> zoinks.
[01:41:55] <moony> Codidact codegolf is much newer than that, it's just recently some of these people started golfing again
[01:41:59] <imode> oh this is a neat rabbit hole.
[01:42:02] <moony> SE kinda nuked the code golf community
[01:42:22] <moony> (as all the mods at the time resigned, leaving PPCG almost fully unmoderated)
[01:42:42] <imode> ignaloidas: that IMO doesn't look too unreasonable. but I was knee-deep in dolphin's JIT at one point.
[01:42:54] <imode> moony: ...ouch.
[01:43:03] <moony> Most of the community left with them

[04:32:26] <dongbei> you don't do that
[04:32:38] <dongbei> i'm sorry yeah that part sucks
[04:32:41] <drobilla> Right.  So there's the answer to your "why" :)
[04:33:17] <dongbei> have you checked out bufferbacked objects and sharedbuffers?
[04:33:17] <drobilla> ... and I absolutely /will/ do that, but the amount of effort and pain it's taking is rough
[04:34:03] *** Joins: Brian38 (~Brian@36.80.236.125)
[04:34:08] <drobilla> e.g. I'm guessing I'll have to replace malloc() and friends with a custom allocator that's wired up to use the contents of a SharedArrayBuffer as an arena
[04:34:17] <dongbei> you betcha
[04:34:24] <imode> makes me wonder why.
[04:34:53] <drobilla> imode: Code on both sides that needs to talk to each other
[04:35:12] <imode> you'd think they'd have a solution to that. you can't manually invoke things?
[04:35:15] <drobilla> (legacy code, so I can't invent the PODish protocol that obviously should exist here)
[04:35:22] <drobilla> imode: You would, wouldn't you!
[04:39:42] <drobilla> I'm sort of torn between "well, fair enough, these two things were really not designed to be used together" and "WHY NOT?!"
[04:40:21] <drobilla> Somehow we have near total implementation monopolies and at the same time the worst features of design by committee
[04:41:01] <imode> wait, WASM doesn't define some form of exported symbol..?
[04:41:03] <dongbei> someone chose to make the browser a very safe sandbox because everyone wants to hack you and your grandma
[04:41:06] <imode> wha.
[04:41:08] <dongbei> that's why
[04:41:30] <imode> oh no wait, WASM defines functions.
[04:41:40] <imode> drobilla: why is your stuff not exported as a WASM function.
[04:41:45] <dongbei> they put a lot of thought into it but it definitely makes things less convenient
[04:42:20] <drobilla> imode: Can't share memory
[04:42:36] <imode> oh so you can't hand a pointer back and forth.
[04:42:41] <drobilla> right
[04:42:41] <imode> gross.
[04:42:45] <imode> why not.
[04:42:54] <drobilla> You can't hand damn near anything back and forth
[04:43:02] <imode> the fuck's the point, then.
[04:43:05] <drobilla> and a lot of things will /actually/ make it over as some weird useless proxy object thing
[04:43:17] <drobilla> so it just silently gives you this bizarro proxy that is useful for nothing
[04:43:19] <drobilla> great fun
[04:43:39] <imode> so if you request, say, a handle to some memory region within the WASM program, it gives you a proxy that does nothing?
[04:43:55] <drobilla> There's also plenty of tips around the Internet about approaches that don't work
[04:43:55] *** Quits: brettgilio (~brettgili@x-node.gq) (Quit: Leaving...)
[04:44:07] <dongbei> imode: sharedbuffers
[04:44:29] <dongbei> webworkers are completely walled off, send the pointer to the shared buffer and the instructions to be run
[04:44:40] <dongbei> the sharedbuffer is the arena
[04:44:57] <drobilla> yep
[04:44:59] <dongbei> you can transfer but it's still not as fast
[04:45:07] *** Joins: brettgilio (~brettgili@x-node.gq)
[04:45:11] <drobilla> Whether or not emscripten will actually let me replace malloc is a no doubt super fun question I'm about to figure out
[04:45:55] <imode> one would think you'd have full access to the WASM program's memory.
[04:45:57] * drobilla hasn't worked with gigantic mountains of spit and bailing wire in a while, tolerance is low
[04:46:16] <imode> so sharing memory would be trivial.
[04:46:19] <imode> why is it walled off.
[04:46:21] <drobilla> imode: At the lowest level you do anyway.  The wasm heap is a big array
[04:46:40] <dongbei> webworkers are their own context, i couldn't give you all the reasoning why
[04:46:52] <dongbei> if you want an umbrella term, then security.
[04:46:53] <imode> soooo can you expose a pointer that's populated from the C side.
[04:47:11] <imode> dongbei: that's not security, that's complexity for nothing. you have control over how your WASM code runs.
[04:47:14] <drobilla> Yeah ultimately you can just shoot numbers around
[04:47:33] <imode> or you should.
[04:47:41] <dongbei> yeah but the thirdparty code that runs in the same frame does not
[04:47:45] <imode> you should be able to single step the friggin' thing, or invoke an individual function.
[04:47:56] <imode> and then examine the interpreter state.
[04:48:11] <dongbei> or rather, every single script that loads on your page has access to that same memory then.
[04:48:18] *** Quits: Brian38 (~Brian@36.80.236.125) (Quit: Client closed)
[04:48:22] <drobilla> The worker API also uses a *script* as the thing to load which makes messing around in this area pretty annoying
[04:48:30] <imode> that's gross.
[04:48:35] <imode> this just feels hacked together.
[04:48:38] <drobilla> You can't, say, write some code and define some things, then write a worker class, then use that class
[04:48:40] *** Quits: brettgilio (~brettgili@x-node.gq) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:48:47] <drobilla> It literally loads "somefile.js"
[04:48:57] <imode> who decided this was a good idea.
[04:49:04] <drobilla> and you can pass no information
[04:49:28] <drobilla> All of this is within a single programming language in the same VM in the same context in the same environment
[04:50:15] <drobilla> /Real/ strong "well we wrote this toy and that works, so that's your architecture now" vibes here
[04:50:23] <imode> seriously.
[04:50:53] <imode> seriously.
[04:50:57] <imode> whoops, wrong window.
[04:51:03] <companion_cube> imode: a strong point of wasm is memory isolation
[04:51:20] <companion_cube> so yeah, sharing its memory is going to be hard, by definition
[04:51:55] <imode> companion_cube: on part of the program or the calling code.
[04:52:20] <imode> because the calling code should totally own the underlying WASM code.
[04:52:22] *** Joins: brettgilio (~brettgili@x-node.gq)
[04:52:26] <imode> have access to memory, everything.
[04:52:47] <imode> and you should have shared memory access via that API, not passing an abstract buffer datatype back and forth.
[04:53:08] <imode> you can wire that up as an abstraction behind peeking and poking ranges of memory in WASMland.
[04:53:09] *** Joins: califax- (~califax@user/califx)
[04:53:51] <imode> either that or pass a buffer data type, but range check on every access.
[04:53:56] <imode> you're paying for safety.
[04:54:34] <drobilla> As far as I can tell "MVP" was the main rationale for the many limitations and nuisances
[04:54:51] <imode> that sounds about right from what I've seen from different WASM talks.
[04:54:53] <drobilla> Fair enough.  Depending on how the non-M progress goes now...
[04:55:41] <drobilla> Wasm itself seems pretty cool so far

[12:50:52] <rb> kline: desktop threads in a nutshell
[12:51:13] <rb> though... kyle will hold a place in my heart
[12:52:06] <EdwardIII> after having worked on a mac for around 7 years i'm thinking about moving back to linux on the desktop. but when i google the hardware or laptops i'm looking at i'm usually faced with threads and threads of people having issues which makes me a bit scared
[12:52:06] <mockturtle> The seven programming ur-languages [lisp ml historical plt apl] (felixyz) https://lobste.rs/s/kwpyt8
[12:52:44] <rb> EdwardIII: if you can afford it and can get it shipped, i'd recommend framework
[12:53:11] <pnoud> Yeah I hear good things about Framework and System76.
[12:53:11] <EdwardIII> i have a feeling getting framework to the UK might be a bit of a pain
[12:53:29] <pnoud> And I think there's another one too?
[12:53:37] <EdwardIII> same with system76. also shipping it back if there's a fault would be pretty troublesome'
[12:53:41] <pnoud> Also aren't ThnkPads good for linux?
[12:53:44] <EdwardIII> they both do look awesome
[12:53:57] <jaffachief> framework don't seem to want to ship to uk yet
[12:54:13] <EdwardIII> i've heard that. i couldn't find any thinkpads with a higher res display though (i want that high dpi text)
[12:54:14] <wink> pnoud: usually, but not all models and not for everyone
[12:54:38] <EdwardIII> i love the iconic red nipple though. my main computer growing up was a smashed thinkpad my dad lifted from work
[12:54:42] <wink> I hate my hidpi T460p
[12:54:42] <pnoud> wink: yeah well if you have used a Mac in the last five years that also describes Apple.
[12:54:45] <kline> system76 im not so hot on
[12:54:50] <kline> they are just badged clevos
[12:54:59] <pnoud> Then... buy a clevo?
[12:54:59] <EdwardIII> wink: why?
[12:55:00] <kline> ive never had a good clevo - i owned one and it was bad
[12:55:05] <pnoud> Oh.
[12:55:10] <kline> ive used others and they were also bad
[12:55:17] <pnoud> Computers are bad
[12:55:28] <wink> EdwardIII: dunno, everythings so small and it's the only machine that feels non-native resolution to me.
[12:55:49] <wink> EdwardIII: and by small I mean nonstandard. ofc you can change it, but it always feels off.
[12:55:53] <EdwardIII> wink: any interest in scaling? like the mac does
[12:56:02] <EdwardIII> i understand that works pretty well with ubuntu + wayland now
[12:56:10] <rb> i like seeing the pixels, though i might be in the minority there
[12:56:13] <wink> it's hards to describe. basically TLDR: I am an old curmudgeon
[12:56:22] <rb> incidentally i also like bitmap fonts
[12:56:22] <wink> and I used an x230 before. the jump was huge
[12:56:29] <EdwardIII> i just love the higher dpi text. on phones + tablets too
[12:56:34] <EdwardIII> just feels more readable and comfy to me
[12:56:39] <wink> I'm not blaming you, but I don't liek it
[12:56:42] <EdwardIII> i'm with linus on that one
[12:56:46] <EdwardIII> sure, i understand :)
[12:56:47] <wink> you might like my t470p. or not :P
[12:56:54] <EdwardIII> hypocritcally i love pixel art
[12:57:07] <jaffachief> dell xps is a good shout too I think
[12:57:20] <jaffachief> do not get anything with an nvidia gpu in it
[12:57:23] <EdwardIII> now
[12:57:28] <EdwardIII> i actually ordered 2 dell XPS
[12:57:59] <wink> I dislike my dell, but again.. :P
[12:58:06] <EdwardIII> then went on holiday, delivery date was the day i got back. came back, nothing. no update on the order status. chased them up. they said "oh maybe it'll be with you by end of november". then they sent an email cancelling the orders
[12:58:15] <wink> it's not a bad machine. https://f5n.org/blog/2021/dell-latitude-5130/
[12:58:16] <mockturtle> [ f5n : Dell Latitude 5310 ] - f5n.org
[12:58:23] <EdwardIII> i was pretty angry. it's a bit crap to wait 14 days THEN cancel someone's order
[12:58:49] <pnoud> Whenever I think of ditching MacOS I look at one of the bajillion Linux distros and wonder which one would support the corporate VPN then think "well I may as well run OpenBSD" and then I stand up and go for a walk because I'm clearly out of my mind.
[12:59:03] <EdwardIII> hehe
[12:59:13] <pnoud> MacOS is terrible but also the best desktop OS.
[12:59:17] <EdwardIII> i constantly run into cpu temp problems on this macbook, that's why i'm looking to move
[12:59:34] <pnoud> I wish my company would just give me a mac mini or an iMac or something.
[12:59:45] <pnoud> My last two MacBooks have been hot (literally) garbage.
[12:59:54] <EdwardIII> yes, probably the true answer is to move to something desktop
[13:00:19] <pnoud> They "aren't supported" because I guess it is still 2019 in the IT department.  Or maybe 1998.
[13:00:47] <pnoud> If I have a desktop how will I carry my computer into the office so I can ignore literally everything everyone says?
[13:02:14] <EdwardIII> jaffachief: why do you say don't get the one with the rtx? linux compatibility?
[13:02:55] <jaffachief> nvidia and linux do not play nice, especially with optimus
[13:03:11] <jaffachief> it's better than it used to be, if you're happy using closed source drivers
[13:03:29] <pnoud> works great, until it doesn't.
[13:03:38] <EdwardIII> i'm ok with closed source drivers. i did read that foone thread about optimus though :D
[13:03:57] <pnoud> But what about ~*ethics*~
[13:03:58] <jaffachief> optimus and nvidia drivers works more or less ok since kernel 5.8 iirc
[13:04:06] <pnoud> Nvidia is bad
[13:04:20] <pnoud> That's what Twitter told me after a couple of drinks
[13:04:23] <EdwardIII> well not just ethics
[13:04:36] <jaffachief> I still get random kernel errors now and again, but nothing that brings down the system
[13:06:15] <EdwardIII> there's this UK supplier who do custom-ish builds i was looking at. but i guess i'm just rolling the dice, if the usb controller is buggy under linux or something
[13:06:59] <iDrougge> jj5: Upgrading via a computer requires less space.

[13:21:52] <pnoud> Linux laptops with better hibernate support than Linux?  ooook.
[13:21:53] <wink> pnoud: well the openbsd devs seem to be more like "I will buy this thing and then write the driver", not sure this doesn't apply to a lot of linux kernel devs as well
[13:21:57] <pnoud> er, than Windows.
[13:22:04] <epilys> "I really wanted ECC [Error-correcting code} memory. I had a hard time finding anything [priced sanely] on Amazon"

[21:50:16] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I'm being made to learn Scheme for my FP class, and I don't expect to use it much after that :P
[21:50:27] <cot> I'm not sure what the author of that article is trying to say.
[21:50:49] <madhadron> Brekkjern, PLT Racket has served me well a time or two when I needed to deploy a simple cross platform GUI as a single executable.

[21:52:04] <technomancy> racket's gui is real good. like ... better than anything else I've used.
[21:52:25] <cot> madhadron: Might I ask why you chose gForth instead of, I dunno, retroforth or factor? (as a recommendation to learn)
[21:52:47] <technomancy> factor is abandoned I think?
[21:52:51] <madhadron> cot, It's an easily available, portable ANS Forth and there's a whole lot more resources for ANS Forth than for anything else.
[21:52:55] <cot> technomancy: No?
[21:52:57] <Brekkjern> Currently I'm using DrRacket as an editor as I don't want to deal with setting it up for VSCode.
[21:53:09] <technomancy> I heard google hired the factor creator to work on dart or something silly like that
[21:53:26] <imode> retroforth is under active development and IMO is a better choice.
[21:53:29] <cot> madhadron: mm, makes sense. I think retroforth deserves a mention though, it's easily hackable and understood

[21:54:04] <cot> should get back to my stack adventures at some point
[21:54:08] <riv> As much as i like alternative languages, I really struggled with forth
[21:54:10] <madhadron> I have to admit that colorForth was too much for me.

[21:55:49] <imode> all arithmetic is bloat.
[21:55:57] <madhadron> technomancy, Right. Just loop over addition and assume the compiler will optimize it to the processor's multiplication instruction.
[21:56:06] <cot> Or... do bit shifting?
[21:56:24] <cot> e.g., '((X << 2) + X) << 1' == 'X * 10'
[21:56:26] <Brekkjern> Or we could just do multiplication...
[21:56:39] <imode> : + 0 <=0 drop-bit > 0=> drop-bit ;
[21:56:51] <imode> unary addition, multiplication is just repeated addition. :P
[21:56:56] <madhadron> cot, Considering that would have to get fed back into the processor's pipeline a few times, I'm betting straight multiplication would be faster today.
[21:57:06] <cot> Well, on the chip8 you definitely want to avoid actual multiplication if possible
[21:57:20] <cot> madhadron: yeah, I was talking about the chip8, shouldda been clear
[21:57:30] <madhadron> Ah. Yeah, on a non-pipelined processor, absolutely.

[23:43:48] <epilys> can't lobste.rs render html/css based on user session? that way you can toggle themes at settings

[23:44:28] <pushcx> There's some discusison of adding a setting, but no one has volunteered to code it, no.
[23:44:41] <riv> oh i thought there was reasons beyond nobody doing the code for it
[23:46:02] <pushcx> No strong reason not to, no. People seem to feel strongly enough about it (or have enough hassles with their browser setup) that it's worth the addex complexity.
[23:46:17] <epilys> also useful: font size change setting, greyscale mode with css filter

[23:49:09] <kline> epilys, most browsers have per-site font zooming anyway
[23:49:48] <kline> i dont have analytics but im willing to say that probably 95% of users are using chrome/ff/edge, which all do
