[20:39:29] <shapr> geekosaur: yeah, it's too bad
[20:39:47] <shapr> there's a Haskell related discord that's somewhat active, but I prefer IRC
[20:40:37] <geekosaur> me too
[20:41:09] <shapr> looks like this function gets called from an MVar, hmm
[20:41:37] <shapr> so if I want to stuff the whole thing into postgres, I'll need to create that function when loading it?
[20:41:43] <shapr> I dunno if that's the right thing or not
[20:42:53] <geekosaur> wonder if you can constructor-ize it
[20:43:02] <shapr> huh?
[20:43:13] <shapr> geekosaur: could you expand on that a bit?
[20:43:47] <geekosaur> rather than an actual function you have a `data` with constructors representing the actual functions and any data they need
[20:44:08] <shapr> hm, that sounds reasonable
[20:44:14] <shapr> do you know of an example you could link?
[20:44:31] <__monty__> Yeah, I'm here for the thorough discussions too : s Maybe no one dares to presume they really understand monads? : )
[20:44:36] <geekosaur> xmonad does this with its layoiuts, so they can be "functions" while remaining serializeable
[20:45:06] <__monty__> Sounds like the interpreter pattern.
[20:45:19] <geekosaur> essentially, yes
[20:45:49] * shapr looks for xmonad example usage
[20:46:22] <geekosaur> most of the intelligence is in the definition of LayoutClass
[20:46:36] <geekosaur> and in particular in instances thereof
[20:47:18] <geekosaur> but using `data` means we can serialize a layout between running instances of xmonad without losing layout state
[20:47:30] <geekosaur> unless the types change
[20:47:58] * shapr blinks
[20:50:40] <__monty__> Reification is the fancy word for it, IIRC.
[21:09:55] <byorgey> "defunctionalization" is another fancy word for it.
[21:10:15] <shapr> thanks
[21:11:03] <byorgey> though I guess if it's IO ()  it's not actually a function.  But some of the same ideas apply.
[21:14:31] <shapr> reading the wikipedia page on defunctionalization helps. in a nutshell "turn a function into a datatype".
[21:16:57] <geekosaur> right. and it doesn't have to be done via a typeclass; we do so so contribs can add their own layouts
[21:17:24] <geekosaur> but if you have only a fixed set of functions then an ordinary data type and interpreter function will work just as well
[21:22:29] <shapr> I may be lucky enough to have only one function, then it's not an issue

[22:10:16] <__monty__> Wouldn't most of the material be suitable to #haskell or -offtopic?
[22:10:55] <geekosaur> haskell is not on topic for -offtopic, and arguably chat gets in the way in #haskell
[22:11:02] <geekosaur> so I can see an argument for it
[22:12:03] <geekosaur> (this said I think there are some bigger offenders in #haskell, and arguably I should start wielding the mod hammer when certain discussions (re)start)
[22:16:10] <geekosaur> like if that strictness vs. laziness by default argument starts again I will be strongly tempted to banish everyone to Discord
