[00:35:32] <fnutt> MaxLeiter: https://builds.kiwiirc.com Not sure which code is used to generate this....
[00:35:47] <fnutt> But it looks good. Very easy to test pull requests for everyone.
[00:38:37] <fnutt> Maybe you know?
[00:41:16] <bookworm> we can just ask in #kiwiirc
[00:41:37] <bookworm> they're a friendly bunch
[00:56:01] <MaxLeiter> looks like they made it, I dont see the source after a quick look
[00:57:09] <bookworm> (_fnutt asked on #kiwiirc so we just need to wait for itsonlybinary to wake up)
[00:57:29] <fnutt> Hopefully we can get a copy of the code.
[00:57:38] <fnutt> It would be very useful for us to have something similar.
[00:57:46] <bookworm> MaxLeiter: squash merge or no squash merge? what's your preference?
[00:57:47] <fnutt> (in my opinion)
[00:57:56] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: if it can be squashed, I squash
[00:58:04] <bookworm> everything can be squashed ;P
[00:58:05] <MaxLeiter> if it makes sense for the commits to be separate I wont 
[00:58:12] <MaxLeiter> but thats rare
[00:58:32] <bookworm> does GH even allow me to squash merge? As the new commit didn't pass the tests yet...
[00:58:34] <bookworm> how do you do it?
[00:58:51] <bookworm> ah, you have override due to being the repo owner?
[01:01:01] <MaxLeiter> ðŸ¤· I didn't realize if i did
[01:01:02] <MaxLeiter> link to PR?
[01:01:15] <MaxLeiter> I didnt realize I was using an override if i was *
[01:01:49] <bookworm> well, right now it's me guessing, so I'll try it and see what happens. Val's logged in / logged out event is fine I think and you already acked it :P
[01:01:56] <bookworm> so I assume you are fine with the general functionality
[01:02:58] <MaxLeiter> github should probably dismiss by approval now that theres been new commits
[01:02:59] <MaxLeiter> one sec
[01:03:13] <bookworm> it doesn't
[01:03:14] <MaxLeiter> assuming those colors work on morning I'm fine with it, cant test rn 
[01:03:21] <bookworm> which I personally find strange as well, but hey
[01:03:28] <MaxLeiter> those colors => icon 
[01:03:32] <bookworm> it's the same colors we are already using
[01:04:07] <bookworm> https://labrat.space/irc/6ddefdbf2aa812b5/Tl.jpeg 
[01:04:24] <MaxLeiter> cool
[01:04:26] <MaxLeiter> https://chat.maxleiter.com/uploads/89b94b8be65deca7/image.png 
[01:04:28] <bookworm> same color as the info bubble, same for logged out, same color as the leave arrows
[01:04:43] <bookworm> yeah, I'm a cli person though
[01:04:47] <bookworm> I use git, not github :P
[01:05:01] <MaxLeiter> I use git but not for github things like merging 
[01:07:22] <bookworm> yep, it gets rejected
[01:07:27] <MaxLeiter> fnutt: kubernetes + a github action would be "simple" to setup for the same thing as what kiwi has 
[01:07:38] <bookworm> simple?
[01:07:41] * bookworm looks at k8s
[01:07:45] <MaxLeiter> thats the quotes :P 
[01:07:48] <bookworm> yeah, no ðŸ˜œ
[01:07:51] <MaxLeiter> but as far as k8s goes its simple
[01:08:54] <MaxLeiter> you could do without it but it makes spawning and removing containers at a whim manageable 
[01:12:10] <MaxLeiter> fnutt: we are 'competing' w kiwi, so I'd rather not put binary in an awkward position 
[01:12:26] <MaxLeiter> if they wanted it open they'd opensource it 
[01:12:59] <fnutt> Sure sure
[01:13:26] <fnutt> but we also have similar goals regarding the irc framework. 
[01:14:00] <fnutt> And we have indeed in the past been helping each orher.
[01:18:16] <bookworm> competing to the point where you use the same framework and share code :P

[04:38:28] <MaxLeiter> yeah the redirects are netlify specific
[04:38:34] <MaxLeiter> i didnt convert them to vercels solution

[04:40:53] <bookworm> the netlify version is rather easier  to read
[04:41:10] <MaxLeiter> yeah but you dont really ever edit it
[04:41:13] <MaxLeiter> last edited 2018
[04:41:17] <bookworm> fair
[04:41:24] <MaxLeiter> plus netlify throws headers and stuff into a separate file where vercel has just one
[04:41:27] <bookworm> I mean you could write code that generates it as well
[04:41:38] <MaxLeiter> (and vercel is at least obvious its vercel-specific, I thought _redirects was a jekyll feature)
