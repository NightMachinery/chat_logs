[00:07:50] <Fieldy> hi! i'm reading the install docs and doing an install. after chroot etc, it says to choose and install a bootloader. okay, i'll use grub, however, it doesn't give me any advice for how to do this: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide#Boot_loader   after chrooted, it seems I don't have grub. i can't seem to figure out how to use pacman to install grub in the chroot. did I miss something?

[01:34:34] <mjsir911> teraflops: plugged in directly, gives me different issues with USB hub that I think are throughput-related
[01:34:48] <teraflops> it also might be related to not having enough power to feed the keyboard on that port
[01:35:11] <umaxtu> but then why would it work on windows?
[01:35:22] <teraflops> magic
[01:35:26] <teraflops> idk tbh
[01:35:28] <mjsir911> oh hmm, I've tried all the ports but that would at least explain why it's been so finecky
[01:36:16] <mjsir911> no luck with upgrading from 5.10 -> 5.15 janmrog, ty for the suggestion

[06:49:41] <jtgd> Hi guys, I'm desperate for help. A few weeks ago I had discussion here about how I was stuck on 5.1.5 kernel because of dropped support for my old nvidia card. It was suggested that I use the nouveau driver instead. Then a week or so ago xorg broke because of some ABI issue and I wasn't able to fix that but system was still up. Woke up this morning to rebooted machine and no X.
[06:49:47] <cohnation75_> i'm in the console
[06:50:06] *** Joins: cyhyraeth (~cyhyraeth@user/cyhyraeth)
[06:50:40] <jtgd> so I did was the wide men here suggested and uninstalled nvidia drivers and upgraded to 5.15.2 and I moved aside the xorg.cong files
[06:51:09] <jtgd> *I did what the wise men...
[06:51:59] <jtgd> I do notice a different in the console after it boots. It changes from crappy looking video that doesn't fit the screen to nice video that does, so it must be using new driver.
[06:53:17] <jtgd> however startx gets into the start of the window manager stuff then stops. I guess it crashes as it becomes unresponsive to anything except the reset button.

[14:02:59] <alad> apart from the kernel, and old versions sometimes required as dependencies, I only know of arch packaging whatever release branch is the latest
[14:03:08] <alad> sometimes that includes git master
[14:03:10] <Gaboradon> Or multiple levels, because I think the idea of not having point releases and having to reinstall the whole OS could still work without having to be on the 100% latest state, but let's say you subscribe to a level 2 that's 1-month behind or level 3 and so on
[14:03:24] <alad> no, arch doesn't have that

[14:03:36] <alad> you can use the archive though to pin your system to a given date, or update monthly
[14:03:50] <Gaboradon> Anyone thought of that before, was it discussed, considered ?
[14:03:51] <alad> AlexC: there was something like it in 2012, but it was external and died out :O
[14:03:52] <dav1d> iirc Fedora/Centos are switching to a model like this
[14:04:01] <AlexC> alad no suprise
[14:04:08] <alad> I don't know
[14:05:03] <jelle> fedora still has release but they also offer rawhide which is basically rolling
[14:05:07] <AlexC> Gaboradon, if you afraid, use Manjaro.
[14:05:09] <rcf> Gaboradon: that is one of the selling points of manjaro. The issue is that without doing proper LTS maintenance (i.e. backporting important fixes) you can end up with the worst of both worlds in the event of, say, a security vulnerability. 
[14:05:17] <Gaboradon> I'm not trying to push anything tho, just wondering because I thought that kind of hybrid approach could remove what all the reviewers out on the web give thumb-down to arch for "being too latest can be bad".

[14:05:23] <alad> for things like postfix it'd definitely be nice so your entire config doesn't break on any update
[14:05:40] <alad> AlexC: manjaro just holds back all packages for 2 weeks with no testing or no security updates
[14:05:45] <alad> it's like a very bad version of using the archive
[14:05:49] <AlexC> they claim they testing
[14:05:51] <Gaboradon> Not that the random youtubers actually matter in the grand scheme of arch things tho ;)
[14:05:52] <alad> ha!
[14:05:54] <dav1d> jelle, I thought they switched recently and you have different release channels you can subscribe to now, not the every-2nd-major-release-is-rolling thing anymore
[14:05:55] <AlexC> i know they don't do shit
[14:05:56] <jelle> Gaboradon: it is the wrong direction
[14:05:57] <AlexC> :DDD
[14:06:15] <jelle> and there is no thumb down anymore on youtube :P
[14:06:28] <AlexC> and whocares anyway
[14:06:29] <Gaboradon> Yeah, I'd like to hear what would be the downsides of this idea?
[14:06:30] <AlexC> :D
[14:06:30] <alad> Gaboradon: I believe Chakra used that approach though
[14:06:40] <alad> though they don't even have pacman in common now
[14:06:43] <jelle> Gaboradon: it's too much effort and requires more effort
[14:06:50] <AlexC> way more effort
[14:06:56] <earnestly> Gaboradon: Use something based on nix, guix, etc. instead
[14:07:04] <jelle> Gaboradon: you basically need to maintain X versions instead of the latest
[14:07:31] <AlexC> and arch never broke on me..
[14:07:38] <AlexC> so "bleeding edge can be bad"
[14:07:40] <AlexC> hehe
[14:07:50] <earnestly> Software in a distribution is built according to all the dependencies around it, you can't just pick and choose with dynamic linking.  All versions for each 'set' has to be congruent
[14:08:07] <alad> arch breaks all the time or none of us would be here
[14:08:14] <AlexC> hmm
[14:08:17] <AlexC> interesting
[14:08:17] <AlexC> :P
[14:08:28] <dav1d> Gaboradon, I dont think rolling release is in any way unstable, software is still tested and does not contain alpha/beta releases either, the problem comes with a system that is constantly updating you and your software have to keep up with the changes, which is generally bad if you're running a server and suddenly you have to update to a new major
[14:08:28] <dav1d> version of a product while you're busy with something else
[14:08:31] <alad> videl actually wrote a nice post about it
[14:08:34] <earnestly> That is why nix and co. have the concept of a general, where each set of changes introduces a new generation, which represents a new / tree

[14:08:59] <rcf> When can I replace btrfs with bcachefs 
[14:09:03] <jelle> :D
[14:09:03] <Gaboradon> So you guys mean like it would take more effort to curate the delayed levels, indeed, but what if you take a step further and automate that based on simply time, if (this update is XYZ old; put it in level2-roll and level3-roll) without having to check or prove that it is more tested/stable/quality
[14:09:23] <earnestly> alad: To be fair, most of what I see here is hardware troubles and help with software that users don't understand, more than breakage per-se
[14:09:30] <jelle> Gaboradon: then it just becomes a trashheap (the older versions)
[14:09:39] <jelle> Gaboradon: and that won't work as you don't roll into fixes
[14:09:44] <AlexC> Gaboradon, thing is, you have to maintain the servers as well, more cost, servers are not free, cpu are not free

[14:17:58] <Gaboradon> jelle: you're probably right, I was just disappointed that the guy can't even take a freaking minute to explain in GH what's going on and it took weeks of insider drama getting emails from him he barely responded to

[14:20:24] <earnestly> alad: Hm, imagine maintaining repos, and thus priviledge separation, as manpage sections.  [8] needs priviledge, [1] doesn't as much
[14:20:33] <jelle> Gaboradon: what could help is that more projects run their CI on Arch Linux :)
[14:21:30] <alad> earnestly: that'd finally give some sense to the seperation of 1 and 8

[14:22:37] <jelle> fedora has github actions which builds an rpm and some tests
[14:22:37] <earnestly> alad: I was thinking that it might make sense to map tool priviledge requirements on an actual install to the priviledge needed to provide those tools.  Most 8 stuff requires root to be useful

[15:51:09] <AlexC> for general use its fine, browsing web, coding stuff like that it's fine

[15:52:28] <Gagis> with wayland + nvidia Electron applications and Chrome were a mess, as were qt apps under gnome, even when setting the renderer for each in config to wayland. I assume games would have ultimately worked at least trough xwayland
[15:52:43] <Gagis> I'll give it another go when I can afford a AMD GPU
[15:53:09] <AlexC> xwayland has a really high performance drop sadly

[18:12:51] <chunk> like, it goes sleep or something, which imo is a retarded default
[18:13:27] <thrice> well first, you shouldn't use the word "retarded," it can be offensive to people.  Second, it's probably not i3, but systemd / logind doing that
[18:13:33] <chunk> ok
[18:13:34] <zeraphel> chunk: i3 does not handle that,  its just a window manager.
[18:14:03] <chunk> i would've thought all those things, except that systemd doess that stuff i didn't know..  God save me should I try to fix
