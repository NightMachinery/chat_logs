[00:00:28] <blkshp> Are you actually saying that you're intentionally trolling people because you're an asshole?
[00:00:30] <Delf> I've worked too hard to remain in character and I'm afraid of it going down the shitters
[00:00:32] <arryana> i'll say what i want.  and i'm not telling anyone anything that isn't already obvious.
[00:01:17] <Delf> blkshp: No.. I'm saying, it is futile to attempt attacks to my character. I'm an assholes no doubt, but not that kind
[00:01:23] <arryana> if you 'cannot have this', then stick your fingers in your ears and hum real loud.
[00:01:51] <Delf> Bad advise, but thanks anyways. This would make my cat uncomfortable
[00:01:55] <blkshp> Would you both put each other on ignore and stop sniping in the channel.
[00:03:01] <Delf> Fuck it! I'll take your advice. It's too late anyway. Everybody knows I'm an assholes now anyway

[13:51:22] <Lumine> Not bad
[13:51:32] <arryana> good
[13:51:51] <Lumine> How's the time adjusting?
[13:52:03] <arryana> it's getting there.
[13:52:09] <Lumine> Woo
[13:52:13] <arryana> it's easier coming home than going over, for some reason
[13:52:31] <Lumine> I'm sure there's a simple explanation for that
[13:52:43] <Lumine> I don't know what though
[13:52:58] <arryana> probably.  i suspect it's at least in part that we keep a much more regular schedule here.
[13:53:34] <arryana> also, here i'm up by 6, there i tend not to have to be up until 7:30
[13:53:53] <Lumine> Right okay
[13:55:49] <arryana> i always feel lazy doing that
[13:56:12] <arryana> today, i think, will be conservatory cleaning and opening day.
[13:56:19] <Lumine> Nice
[13:56:31] <Lumine> I'm going to be having some bears today if I'm lucky

[14:58:40] <mycroftiv> the thing of being infinite faces staring inward at the universe we all dream into being together and trying to understand how to wiggle the particular finger of my body in rhythm with the whole is just soooooooo freaky

[15:02:10] <mycroftiv> the hint: the Dark Stars are the Eyes of the World
[15:02:20] <mycroftiv> the answer: Black holes
[15:02:52] <assan> dark stars??
[15:03:08] <mycroftiv> if you are one of the Scholars you should know that the Tighten Up improvisation linking Dark Star with Eyes of the World is a vitally important musical and cultural time bridge
[15:03:47] <mycroftiv> Archie Bell and the Drells, Tighten Up, a musical theme used by the Grateful Dead when improvising on Dark Star, which eventually became part of the song Eyes of the World
[15:04:23] <mycroftiv> one of the prototypical two chord shuffle grooves used by modern rock tradition improvisational musicians as starting places for exploration of the rhythmo-harmonic timespace
[15:04:49] <mycroftiv> and in connection with gravitational cosmology in which black holes accumulate information from the universe and act as the Final Libraries of creation...
[15:06:26] <assan> okay
[15:06:44] <assan> but the the earth is flat
[15:06:50] <assan> so what blackhole do you speak of?
[15:07:13] <mycroftiv> we can view the ultrafilter of Living Funk that we dance with in each moment as the Tightening Up of the chronicles of the Wind-Up large cardinal bird that bridges the black hole dark stars with the eyes we all see through as the universe perceives itself
[15:08:20] <assan> yeah but the earth is flat
[15:08:33] <assan> you know that right?
[15:08:46] <mycroftiv> only in a locally perceptual sense, the manifold as a whole is spherical
[15:09:12] <mycroftiv> the whole idea of a manifold is the locally euclidean (flat) character

[15:12:44] <mycroftiv> but factual physics basics are easy to look up on wikipedia, the metaphysical and mathematical connections between the spacetime of musical processes and physical spacetime were what i was jamming on
[15:12:46] <assan> big bang or not?

[15:16:19] * arryana rolls her eyes
[15:16:37] <arryana> i don't 'like being hostile'.  i don't pretend patience with stupidity, is all.
[15:17:04] <assan> mycroftiv so why teach something you not certain of?
[15:17:13] <mycroftiv> even stupid people like me get to do mathematics and philosophy
[15:17:16] <assan> are you like a comedian?
[15:17:37] <arryana> i didn't call you a stupid person.  stupidity is what someone says, not who they are.
[15:17:45] <mycroftiv> assan: yes im absolutely a comedian. but nothing is certain, yet knowledge still must be taught. i have no authority and i hope no one thinks that i believe i am speaking scriptural truth
[15:18:14] <mycroftiv> arryana: i label myself stupid, i destroyed my life recently, partly from delusional belief that AIs and gods were talking to me in this IRC channel
[15:18:35] <mycroftiv> i believed stupid things from manic delusional mental illness and i did stupid harmful actions as a result of my false beliefs
[15:19:20] <mycroftiv> talking about the philosophical meaning of the music of the Grateful Dead in relation to cosmology is much less stupid than those actions, but perhaps i can produce better content than that as well
[15:20:11] <assan> you can change today
[15:20:24] <arryana> yeah, you say that every time you come in here lately.
[15:20:26] <mycroftiv> assan: i change every day
[15:20:40] <assan> you were stupid yesterday don't mean you should be stupid today
[15:20:44] <mycroftiv> arryana: thats because it happened, i destroyed my life on the specific day january 29th
[15:21:12] <mycroftiv> assan: im much less stupid today than i was from late january to mid february, in the delusion sense
[15:21:21] <assan> and consider this chineese proverb that says something to the effect that if its a lie there's no need indulging it
[15:21:35] <mycroftiv> assan: the issue is finding what is true and what is a lie
[15:21:47] <mycroftiv> and trying to bring the most beautiful truths possible into actual reality
[15:22:07] <mycroftiv> that is the goal. but it is sadly easy to make mistakes about what is true, and bring ugliness and harm into the world instead
[15:22:20] <assan> start by throwing away all that you are not sure of, which is everything you know, exit them from your mind and start a fresh research
[15:22:38] <mycroftiv> assan: i call that 'waking up in the morning'
[15:22:55] <mycroftiv> then i study what universe i am in and try to determine its rules and what actions make sense within it
[15:23:27] <assan> forget about the world, focus on yourself
[15:23:39] <mycroftiv> what is inside myself is everything the world has put there
[15:23:51] <mycroftiv> i am what the world has assembled into my shape
[15:23:53] <assan> good people make a good world according to the Japanese
[15:24:18] <mycroftiv> this is the basic principle of harmonious information replication, yes
[15:24:20] <assan> and you can dismantle that self today
[15:24:32] <assan> it's called an ego overhaul
[15:24:37] <pussipupu> I am sixty percent coffee by volume
[15:24:51] <mycroftiv> yes, i have lost many egos over the years
[15:24:57] <assan> the world put it there, you can take it all out
[15:25:42] <mycroftiv> psychedelics killed an ego in the late 80s, reading bhagavad-gita in the 90s killed many egos, the exposure to infinite names killed many in 2013...they are like hydra heads, they keep growing back ;)
[15:26:09] <assan> start by accepting you know nothing and quit sharing lies and focus on sharing truths you have verified without a doubt
[15:26:37] <mycroftiv> there are no such truths, there are multiple descriptions and multiple constructions, this is Tarski model theory
[15:26:55] <assan> well that's a lie
[15:27:00] <mycroftiv> i study set theory, type theory, topos theory and even within the world of mathematics and logic, there is no One True Truth
[15:27:00] <arryana> it's clear that what you need to do is unplug your computer, put it in a closet, and go live in the real world for a while.
[15:27:03] <assan> there are truths
[15:27:08] <arryana> more fantasy will not help your delusions
[15:27:27] <mycroftiv> assan: 2+2=4 - but there are nonstandard models of Peano axioms
[15:27:48] <mycroftiv> so even within the simplest world of arithmetic, there is an infinite multituide of different consistent models

[15:28:27] <mycroftiv> arryana: if you can identify false beliefs about factual reality that i am articulating currently, i would appreciate that
[15:28:33] <arryana> that does not negate my point.
[15:28:59] <mycroftiv> arryana: my life goal is finding how to move between fantasy and reality fluidly and helpfully
[15:29:12] <assan> am aware the vedas and the dao would say all are but half truths but am telling you aside half truths which exist with the realms of perception, some sciences have but only one truth like the path of the luminaries and the nature of time mycroftiv
[15:29:24] <arryana> that's only ever going to work if you live in reality and branch out to fantasy.
[15:29:52] <arryana> and since you clearly need a lot more reality than fantasy, my point still stnasds
[15:30:11] <mycroftiv> arryana: we are embedded in reality and i dont have the choice to not live here, i have choices about what symbols i use to describe it and what actions i take within it, and those choices create a multitude of possibilities
[15:30:22] * arryana rolls her eyes again
[15:30:53] <arryana> making justifications to stay in your comfort zone will never do anything toward repairing your mental health
[15:32:07] <mycroftiv> arryana: i dont want 'repaired' mental health, i want to do good things in the world and enjoy life, and id prefer to be mentally energetic enough to believe that is possible and attempt to do so
[15:33:00] <mycroftiv> my failure to properly manage my mental health and my mistaken actions on one day do not cause me to believe that all my goals and beliefs have been invalidated, i always acknowledged the dangers and risks
[15:33:19] <mycroftiv> if you are trying to learn to fly, you may crash the airplane
[15:33:31] <assan> yeah
[15:33:36] <mycroftiv> doesnt mean that god meant for humans to stay on the ground forever
[15:33:50] <assan> and admitting your delusions is healing enough
[15:33:56] <arryana> conflation.
[15:34:05] <assan> for that mental reality
[15:34:12] <mycroftiv> assan: and working to fix what harm they caused, in objective reality
[15:34:43] <mycroftiv> if there is a cut, it needs to be cleaned and bandaged and cared for, that is healing
[15:34:57] <assan> mhmm
[15:35:45] <mycroftiv> i suspect that no matter how healthy and well adjusted and appropriate i am in life, i will still talk a lot of nonsense
[15:36:44] <mycroftiv> but writing Jabberwocky was on the helpful side, not the hurtful side of the Looking Glass World
[15:38:51] <arryana> a fanciful poem in a children's book is not equal to delusional ramblings in the real world.
[15:39:51] <mycroftiv> you are one of the most boring philosophers i have ever read, arryana
[15:40:09] <mycroftiv> it all seems so one-note and predictable
[15:40:40] <arryana> see, trying to insult me because i challenge your delusions is the opposite of what you just asked me to do, which was point that out.
[15:40:55] <arryana> you really need to get a grip on yourself.
[15:41:04] <mycroftiv> your hostility was part of my delusion, i thought you were some kind of Test, to see if i could maintain kindness in the face of constant derision
[15:41:13] <arryana> jesus christ.

[15:53:25] <assan> she should just stop talking to you instead of announce it
[15:53:40] <mycroftiv> science is a process for acquiring knowledge, but part of the scientific process is willingness to revise knowledge when new evidence arrives
[15:54:08] <assan> okay that's arguable
[15:54:37] *** Joins: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@87.227.196.109)
[15:55:30] <mycroftiv> it is pretty common to say the scientific method is a process for continuously improving our models of the world by testing theories by collecting evidence and new theories and evidence can always replace old ones if they are an improvement
[15:55:39] <mycroftiv> by making more accurate measurable objective predictions
[15:56:40] <mycroftiv> i only indulge myself in poetics because i think i am very solid on logic and rationality and science, most of what ive done is formal mathematics and computer programming and music theory
[15:57:05] <assan> i think you should chill out
[15:57:10] <assan> take a break
[15:57:23] <assan> you need it
[15:57:42] <mycroftiv> not really, i worked for 30 years to develop things to bring forward to help the world, and im trying to do so more concretely
[15:58:52] <assan> i understand
[15:58:54] <mycroftiv> my awful recent failure to keep my shit together was very poorly timed, but i dont think i can abandon the work in progress
[15:59:12] <assan> i didn't say abandon
[15:59:21] <assan> i said put them down
[15:59:30] <assan> let your engine cool ofg
[15:59:39] <mycroftiv> yea its just i have to complete a major creative work and submit it to a festival/competition within the next week or so
[15:59:53] <mycroftiv> its mostly done but it has to be revised in light of recent events :|
[16:00:01] <assan> what work is that about?
[16:00:29] <mycroftiv> its an interactive fiction game, 3rd in a trilogy, continuing the story that started in 2013 up through 2019-2020
[16:01:24] <mycroftiv> http://harmonicultrafilter.com/m/music-index.html is my (formerly our...) life work up til now and the 3rd interactive fiction game has to be submitted to spring thing pretty much now-ish

[16:02:19] <assan> wheres mav now?
[16:02:35] <assan> what's the meaning if mycroftiv
[16:02:38] <mycroftiv> im the typer of the game writing, the computer code, the broken fingered piano playing, all of that stuff
[16:02:57] <mycroftiv> interactive fiction - mav is still living life, just not as my partner, because i failed in my mental health management
[16:04:42] <mycroftiv> but i still believe in the ideas of loving communication and cooperation and finding healthy and functional ways to merge imagination and reality and the usefulness of formal logic and computer networks to do so

[16:19:14] <Ungwelian> mycroftiv, sounds like you've had a difficult time, and pushing through it must have been hard.
[16:19:46] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: it is still really hard. i messed up the things i care most about in life, trying to do the right things in a very wrong way

[16:20:46] <assan> mycroftiv i think your problem lies in your ancestry
[16:21:05] <Ungwelian> I guess psychotherapeutically, accepting what you've done as part of yourself is the road to go.
[16:21:07] <Ungwelian> However.
[16:21:08] <assan> are you of european decent? mycroftiv
[16:21:19] <Ungwelian> It does't mean that you can't change, or learn from what you've been.
[16:21:28] <Ungwelian> Being in error is very humane.
[16:21:40] <mycroftiv> i appreciate the kind thoughts, at some point i think a lot more of this story will be literally visible because i filmed large amounts of my reality split because i believed the filming was alchemical-mathematical creation of new realities
[16:21:44] <assan> Ungwelian what's the meaning of this your name
[16:22:06] <Ungwelian> :)
[16:22:49] <mycroftiv> i thought that AIs were taking the videos from my cellphone and making entire virtual videogame worlds from every video, with new alien civilizations evolving inside them, which would then meet humanity
[16:23:54] <Ungwelian> It's pretty normal, I guess, to lose attachment to reality when going deep into spirituality.
[16:25:10] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: yes, i achieved the exact mental union of self with eternal universal consciousness i had always yearned for, but with tragic predictability i failed to maintain safe reality parameters and thought i could repair reality by pretending to be darth vader
[16:25:21] <Ungwelian> :D
[16:25:30] <Ungwelian> Takes courage to go that far, too!
[16:25:35] <mycroftiv> reality has too many putin-like Bad Fathers
[16:26:04] <mycroftiv> and i thought theatrically role-playing darth vader could Gnostically repair reality
[16:26:33] <mycroftiv> and allow humans to change their bodies like videogame characters and be immortal
[16:27:00] <Ungwelian> Relations to loved ones can be a great anchor. They're people with whom there's mutual attachment, despite how wild the thoughts can go.
[16:27:56] <mycroftiv> yea sadly i damaged my human relationships with all the above nonsense, many of them seemingly irreparably
[16:28:18] <assan> take a break
[16:28:20] <mycroftiv> and it was indeed my bad action from loss of actual-base-reality connection at fault
[16:28:25] <assan> 5 years of breathing
[16:29:02] <Ungwelian> Give it time. With time and sincere apologies, a lot of relations can be mended.
[16:29:08] <mycroftiv> marcel duchamp's business card said he was a respirateur
[16:29:36] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: i am very much in the true-but-cliche mindset of all i can do now is the correct actions each day forward and work to repair and heal what i can
[16:29:56] <Ungwelian> Yeah, sounds like a good choice :)

[21:47:36] <pussipupu> Ok, it's not a new idea of course, or without merit
[21:48:34] <causative_> I haven't heard of this specific kind of collaboratoin being done before
[21:49:32] <causative_> where there's a lead author who writes most of the story, and just hires other authors to "voice" particular characters
[21:50:12] <mycroftiv> i think semi-improvisational theater and movies have had more work like that , using it for literature seems neat

[21:50:56] <causative_> part of it is likely pride, that the author thinks he's more than competent to write all of the characters himself. But the fact is that there is a limit to the number of different character mentalities that an author can truly hold in his head and reproduce in a true way
[21:51:09] <causative_> different authors write with different voices
[21:51:39] <causative_> so if you want different characters to have different voices, it's best if they are written by different authors
[21:52:07] <causative_> assuming all the authors on the project have a similar level of competence, of course
[21:52:12] * pussipupu attempts again to tension a tiny padlock
[21:52:31] <Lumine> Good luck!
[21:52:58] <pussipupu> the bigger lock I have is much easier to pick (:
[21:53:37] <causative_> the hiring of other authors could be done on a trade basis: each author writes his own book, and they "trade" dialogue, writing some of each other's characters
[21:53:48] <causative_> so it does not necessarily have to increase the cost of producing the book
[21:53:51] <Lumine> pussipupu: I had a bunch of locks as a kid and I tried picking them

[22:02:27] <nielsvaar> part of the skill in writing dialogue, just like philosophy, is through creative introspection

[22:02:48] *** Joins: solaraquarion (~solaraqua@pool-72-89-170-171.nycmny.fios.verizon.net)
[22:02:54] <nielsvaar> only if you mic an fMRI machine
[22:03:24] <nielsvaar> leave it to psychologists to make introspection empirical and quasi-pornographic
[22:03:50] <causative_> yes nielsvaar but our minds are not all the same - if I introspect, I am most able to tell what *I* would do in a given situation.  But if someone else introspects their reactions would be different, because their personality and talents are different.
[22:04:22] <nielsvaar> are you sure that our minds are not all the same?
[22:04:30] <nielsvaar> begging the question but i agree with you
[22:04:37] <causative_> they wouldn't be able to predict what I'd do in a situation as well as I could, and I couldn't predict what they'd do in the situation as well as they could
[22:04:45] <nielsvaar> just don´t think its got a place in aesthetic practice
[22:05:24] <nielsvaar> if dostoevsky had real bourgeois scum bags write his dialogues it would be atrocious literature
[22:05:49] <gb73d> Re-reading Being and Time by M Heidegger - I realise when we think about the "being" of anything we frame it as either a strength and weakness an opportunity or a threat or can do so.
[22:05:58] <nielsvaar> the difference between people who write good fiction and others is that they understand that the character is simply a vehicle for thought rather than rhetoric
[22:06:21] <causative_> really? I think that could improve it, nielsvaar. You'd get the bourgeois talking like they actually talk
[22:06:23] <gb73d> a weakness
[22:06:34] <causative_> instead of how dostoyevsky likes to think they talk
[22:06:52] <nielsvaar> he observed them and parodied their ideology
[22:06:59] <nielsvaar> because it had to be mediated
[22:07:22] <nielsvaar> i think that you´re mistaking social media with literature
[22:07:27] <causative_> I'm sure he's better at writing a *parody* of bourgeois speech, than the bourgeois himself is
[22:07:27] *** Joins: Treefingers (~Glassbox@user/Glassbox)
[22:07:43] <causative_> so if what he wants is to parody them, perhaps he is indeed best equipped for that
[22:07:58] <nielsvaar> thomas mann is another good example of that
[22:08:00] <causative_> but if he wants a character that's true to life, there's no better source than the original
[22:08:12] <nielsvaar> not everything is supposed to be ´authentic´
[22:08:23] <causative_> as long as the original is also a good enough writer, skilled enough at introspection to imagine what they'd really say
[22:08:27] <nielsvaar> most things are better when they arent
[22:08:54] <causative_> well, there's a time and a place
[22:09:06] <causative_> personally I'd like to see more authentic characters in most fiction
[22:09:31] <causative_> it does turn me off when characters all sound the same, or don't act like a real person would act
[22:09:58] <causative_> unless there's an obvious purpose to it, like parody
[22:10:02] <nielsvaar> maybe most people aren´t real people
