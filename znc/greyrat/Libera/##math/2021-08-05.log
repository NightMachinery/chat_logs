[02:50:08] <BytesAndCoffee> my programming style is very adhd
[02:51:12] <BytesAndCoffee> well, from (1, 5) to (8, 7), the moves are 'rd', 'rd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd', which sums to (2, 7)

[04:55:09] <int-e> Then you can isolate the square root... sqrt(1-x^2) = ..., and square. Hmm. Unforunately that seems to give a quartic polynomial.
[04:55:23] *** Joins: gggp_ (~gggp@125.33.82.158)
[04:55:46] <drobi> does it give an actual quartic or a biquadratic?
[04:55:53] *** Joins: HisShadow (~HisShadow@user/hisshadow)
[04:55:55] <cherim> It's fundamentally quartic
[04:56:23] <cherim> 2 (a cos(p) + b sqrt(1 - cos^2(p))) (c + d cos(p)) - t = 0 is actually 2 (a cos(p) + b sin(p)) (c + d cos(p)) - t = 0

[04:58:48] <drobi> cherim: what do you mean by linearly transform into those?
[04:59:45] <cherim> It's mostly for int-e. I meant that the formulas for the coefficients of the quartic in terms of a,b,c,d are transparent enough not to expect some miraculaous cancellations

[05:14:35] <int-e> u = tan(p/2), sin(p) = 2u/(1+u^2), cos(p) = (1-u^2)/(1+u^2) should give another quartic
[05:15:25] <drobi> is that one particularly nicer?
[05:15:37] <int-e> well, it avoids complex numbers
[05:15:48] <drobi> right

[10:56:27] <rsonx> I have read somewhere that when we talk about non determinism of an automaton, we mean that the automaton has more than one choices and could branch on them. But this branching is finite i.e the non deterministic automaton always has more than one but finite number of choices to take.

[11:26:42] <lieven> there are some nits with the non determinism type of definition but in a finite number of steps you can only consume a finite number of bits of that string
[11:27:40] <lieven> I think the approach of NP with a polynomial verifier aided by a witness works better

[11:36:43] <rsonx> hmmn one doubt that I always had as a beginer was that if the algorithm guesses a string non deterministically, won't it be just for one string and we have to rerun the algo to get other strings?
[11:38:57] <lieven> well the whole point of NP is that it isn't a viable algorithm. It's an existential definition like 'there is one string such that it works out'.
[11:39:34] <lieven> If you convert a non deterministic automaton to a deterministic one with the subset construction you get exponential blow up (in the worst case)

[13:02:40] <biberao> hi
[13:03:18] <Gurkenglas> Utility functions assign a real-numbered score to each world - they're functions W->R. They're invariant under affine transformations, so really utility functions are W->R modulo the equivalence relation that equates two functions if one is an affine transformation of the other. How might one aggregate a distribution of these? not by taking an expectation, certainly.

[15:32:46] <Fangs> nothing fancy, just an intepretation. I only know very naive  very informal'alg geom' anyway C[x1,..,xn]/(some polynomials) are functions defined on the zeroes of the polynomial
[15:32:59] <Capso> Fangs: the Hilbert Nullstellensatz gives a correspondence between varieties and ideals
[15:34:18] <Fangs> Capso: if you hit my question with nullstellensatz you get (x-z) I think
[15:34:47] <Capso> in that sense, the relationship is "size-inverted" like you mention: a big variety means the polynomials in the ideal have many zeros and that "cuts away" at the number of such polynomials

[16:40:51] <Capso> the point is not really to keep generalizing, but to see how much you can get out of k=2. and also that the vector space structure doesn't tell you any of this; you have to go back to the multiplicative parts to get the geometry

[17:25:49] <Capso> Given a sequence of random variables X_j, the law of large numbers guarantees that if E[X_j] =: m exists, then the sum of averages \bar{X}_N := (1/N) sum X_j converges to m. The proofs I know make use of the existence of m; is there also a guarantee that if we know only that \bar{X}_N -> m' then E[X_j] = m' ?

X_j and dirac_{x_j} is the delta on the point x_j, for any sequence of x_j that densely fills the compact space? Then, the mean ought to exist, no?

[21:13:15] <quarterback> Is there a good way to calculate air turbulence on different types of kites?
[21:13:33] <quarterback> I want to calculate drag and lift to design kite shapes.
[21:14:25] <bildramer> not really
[21:14:42] <quarterback> I am seeing which shapes creates drag and lift
[21:14:58] <nagefire> you would have better luck running simulations
[21:15:02] <bildramer> you could use one of the many solvers available, but kites are very low velocity and turbulence is a big factor
[21:15:46] <quarterback> This is a kite I made with simple stuff. Its a double square/rhombus kite https://drive.google.com/file/d/14J9-s8sYTbtjfn8iMeaXvgtXHSYeX8j2/view
[21:16:10] <quarterback> The bottom kite had more drag and it was bending too much so I created a vent on it.
[21:16:53] <quarterback> I imagined how the kite would get enough lift to raise high and it has good pull too.
[21:17:19] <bildramer> experimenting and practical experience is going to be more effective than theory. that said, you can still try to calculate/think diagrammatically about stability, balance and so on
[21:17:48] <quarterback> bildramer, This was a experimental kite.
[21:18:44] <quarterback> Most of my kites are based on experimentation and prediction of stability.

[21:19:28] <quarterback> I was trying to calculate air turbulence or perhaps write a ODE for air flow. Use bernoulis theorem and so on .
[21:20:02] <bildramer> while actual calculations are not going to work well, for a flat plane you can assume drag is low at near-parallel-to-airflow angles, and gets high fast; and lift is zero at 0 degrees, reaches a maximum before 20-30 degrees, then falls off rapidly
[21:20:44] <bildramer> then add up forces on planes, keeping in mind that if a part is "shadowed" by another, it won't contribute much
[21:21:25] <quarterback> The thing is that this kite was sometimes catching wind and had strong pull and then suddenly it lost the wind and was floating. The design has both left ends and right ends tied together with a string which is not shown.

[21:25:37] <bildramer> for a full 3D kite what I would do is start with a basic model of a flat wing that works as I described (over 30 degrees = high drag 0 lift, as you approach 0 deg drag goes to a low value, lift has a maximum around 15-20 then goes back to 0, this all depends a bit on velocity), then add up the angle-dependent forces (and torques!) for a few planes and do some stability analysis, but that's all complicated
[21:25:46] <quarterback> bildramer, It seems to give a general impression of wind turbulence flow.

[21:26:57] <female_student_4> Why has he done that
[21:27:11] <female_student_4> this is for the f'(x) case
[21:27:40] <bildramer> what do you mean, why?
[21:28:47] <female_student_4> So,
[21:28:48] <female_student_4> def f_dash(function,x,dx):
[21:28:58] <female_student_4> return (function(x+dx)-function(x-dx))/ (2*dx)

[21:29:08] <female_student_4> So x= 1
[21:29:13] <female_student_4> and dx= 1/100
[21:29:21] <female_student_4> Why is dx being passed through as 1/100
[21:29:46] <bildramer> it's just "some small value"
[21:30:00] <nagefire> the smaller dx is, the smaller the error between the difference and the actual derivative at that point
[21:30:02] <bildramer> this is an approximation of f'
[21:30:11] <bildramer> 1/10000000 would be more accurate
[21:30:23] <female_student_4> Oh okay, so if I were to do f''(x)
[21:30:27] <female_student_4> and pass through 1/100 for dx
[21:30:29] <female_student_4> It wouldn't matter?
[21:30:39] <cloudcell> hello everyone, can anyone point me to a source that describes how to calculate the number of paths between two nodes in a directed graph? (not DAG)
[21:31:06] <female_student_4> Thanks for the advice!
[21:31:11] <bildramer> it might matter if f(x) has details smaller than 1/100 in size
[21:31:15] <bildramer> otherwise, no
[21:31:21] <bildramer> getting it _too_ small could lead to numerical problems, too, so don't do that
[21:33:37] <female_student_4> Why does dx have to be a small value though? I kind of remember why but not exactly
[21:34:06] <nagefire> the derivative is just the limit of the difference quotient as dx -> 0

[23:00:54] <Hagfish> in particular i'm interested in polynomials that generate an infinite number of different integer values, which don't have a common factor
[23:01:19] <Z-module> f(x) = 4    is a good one
[23:01:37] <Z-module> (not for infinitely many values)
[23:01:43] <Hagfish> yeah
[23:01:53] <Hagfish> i'm sure there are more interesting ones
[23:01:58] <Z-module> hmm, well, f(x) = 4x
[23:02:15] <Hagfish> which have a common factor, of course
