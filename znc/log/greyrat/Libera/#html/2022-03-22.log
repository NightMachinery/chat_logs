[02:24:06] <nbjoerg> AkQ: you can try to check for the referrer attribute
[02:27:59] <AkQ> hmmh thanks
[02:29:40] <nbjoerg> (but frankly, it is generally not going to work against motiviated attackers)
[02:31:21] <AkQ> short answer "no" long answer "yes but actually no" 
[02:38:39] <CuriosTiger> Basically, if you want them to see the image, you have to let them download it.
[02:38:45] <CuriosTiger> Referers are easily faked.
[02:39:01] <CuriosTiger> There are other tricks you can try, but at the end of the day, none of them are a guarantee.
[02:39:15] <CuriosTiger> Even if you manage to completely control the browser, what's to stop them from taking a screen shot?
[02:46:10] <nbjoerg> referers work for stealing bandwidth by embedding it as <img> on other sites
[02:46:11] <nbjoerg> that's about it

[19:00:28] <stevelitt> DPA, could you please elaborate on rules 2 and 4 of your four rules of writing better Javascript? I *think* I use the DOM already (e.g. myelement.InnerHTML) but I'm not sure. Also,what kind of templates are you speaking of? I'm reading about inversion of control right now and might ask you questions. Thanks!

[19:20:17] <xheimlich> I'm trying to generate an html table from server side for a very simple log-viewing endpoint. But when I simulate this on a phone with Chrome's devtools, it looks tiny rather than filling the width of the screen. 
[19:20:21] <xheimlich> https://dpaste.org/ws7C
[19:21:08] <xheimlich> I didn't want to spend more than a half hour or so doing this, so what's the simplest thing that makes a table window-width aware?
[19:21:19] <xheimlich> (You can tell I haven't HTMLed since 1999)
[19:25:35] <stevelitt> I don't know what Chrome devtools is, but I'm pretty sure making the fonts bigger would make the table bigger. I'm assuming the reason you don't like the tiny table is the text is unreadable.
[19:25:53] <xheimlich> great, I broke validator.nu
[19:26:30] <stenno> sounds just like a thing with different UA stylesheets
[19:26:35] <stenno> nothing to worry about imo
[19:26:55] <stevelitt> I think the CSS goes something like this (untested): table tr td {font-size: 150%}
[19:27:44] <stevelitt> Whoops I forgot a semicolon after 150%.
[19:27:45] <xheimlich> anyway, I followed all of its recommendations and think this would have validated. (I was just missing the doctype)
[19:27:48] <xheimlich> https://dpaste.org/UQkC
[19:28:39] <xheimlich> still no... what's the fancy word for "adjust to screen sizes"?
[19:30:06] <xheimlich> all I need is a table that fills the phone's width (and increases in font size). My HTML is perfectly formed according to that validator thing.
[19:38:34] <nbjoerg> xheimlich: using the screen width is easy, but scaling up font size doesn't happen automatically to the content
[19:38:49] <nbjoerg> you can derive font-size from the unit vw
[19:39:02] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:40:27] <xheimlich> the dream of the 90s was that html was supposed to be declarative.
[19:40:38] <xheimlich> I guess I'll just tell them to rotate their screens.
[19:41:21] <xheimlich> what's the word for "works on big screens and mobile too"? There's a word.
[19:41:31] <xheimlich> Don't you hate when you lose words
[19:41:33] <xheimlich> RESPONSIVE
[19:41:45] <nbjoerg> declarative doesn't mean magic
[19:41:57] <nbjoerg> the browser can't read your mind
[19:42:26] <xheimlich> I guess. I don't have the knowledge to argue this.
[19:46:37] <xheimlich> I wish I had kept up with a basic working knowledge of web tech after the 90s. I could make Web Pages, man. 
[19:47:09] <xheimlich> I feel more than a little hamstrung by how little I understand front-end devs in daily standups.
[19:49:53] <xheimlich> The GUI programming I never wasted time learning is gone. Everything just runs a little web server for monitoring or even making data charts. I feel like the apes in the movie 2001. 
[20:09:25] <stevelitt> xheimlich, to make the table fill the screen, I believe what you need is CSS table{width: 100%;}
[20:10:47] <xheimlich> Yeah, but I think what's needed is larger fonts. As I said, I'm just going to tell the business side (there are two of us, and one is me) to rotate their phones.
[20:12:32] <stevelitt> xheimlich, also keep in mind that <head/> can contain a viewport, as in <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=0.65">
[20:13:01] <stevelitt> Adjusting the viewport can adjust how it looks on the screen.
[20:14:15] <stevelitt> xheimlich, have you tried rotating the phone? I would think doing so would not increase the size of the table, if the table is already too small in portrait.
[20:14:29] <stevelitt> Or if the fonts are too small in portrait.
[20:14:58] <stevelitt> By the way, my opinion, media queries suck, so keep that in mind when people advise you to use media queries.
[20:16:15] <xheimlich> is viewport literally "viewport" there, or do I need to replace it for something?
[20:16:25] <xheimlich> stevelitt: not with a phone. just chrome's simulator.
[20:16:52] <xheimlich> but generally rotating my phone lets me see pages that don't adapt well.
[20:19:19] <xheimlich> I once made an actual storefront, or almost one, in 1997 or 1998.
[20:19:34] <xheimlich> payments weren't a thing then. they sold by bank deposit.
[20:19:52] <xheimlich> the number of cents was a sales code. Clever people.
[20:21:37] <xheimlich> I had tables and an HTML form that triggered a PHP script that queried a database. Not a SQL database, a CSV file that was uploaded by the customer from a VBS script on Windows. I also made the thing that made the CSV file in first place, reading from their ancient DBF-based inventory tool. This in Haskell of all things.
[20:21:47] <xheimlich> somehow I didn't follow up on that career.
[20:23:55] <stevelitt> Viewport is literally "viewport": The meta is named "viewport" like other metas might be named "description" or "keywords".
[20:24:16] <xheimlich> Eh, I'm yakking. Good afternoon everyone.
