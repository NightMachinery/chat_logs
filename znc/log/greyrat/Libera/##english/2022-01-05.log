I'm confident complete a certain task.   But in dating, I hear "confidence" used as if the speaker means be outgoing and the opposite shy when they say "be confident".

[17:52:30] <Etienne> ok so when you have X's Y and X is plural (so might be "Xs'Y"), Y should also take an "s"? Is it the same with "Y of Xs"? or is it the kind of stuff where it depends on what X and Y are?

[18:34:04] <NccT> "the pool was deceptively shallow", does it mean shallow or not?
[18:34:33] <LuisR14> seemed shallow but really it wasn't
[18:34:56] <NccT> so it is a deep one?
[18:36:01] <LuisR14> err, reverse actually, seemed deep to your eyes, but really it was shallow
[18:37:29] <NccT> I don't get it. first you said seemed shallow, now you say it seemed deep?
[18:37:41] <alguien> NccT, he made a mistake
[18:37:47] <alguien> NccT, the pool is shallow

[19:32:04] <huf> you should be able to figure it out from context tho
[19:32:10] <TimMc> So, use context when reading it, and maybe try not to use it in your own writing/speech.
