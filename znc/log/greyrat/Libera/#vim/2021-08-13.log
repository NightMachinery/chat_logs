[01:26:08] <hseg> in particular, it won't repeat the substitution I want
[01:26:36] <hseg> guess I could just push that into a separate macro and just repeat it
[01:27:04] <hseg> but for next time, is there a betteer way?
[01:27:16] <phy1729> You can clear out a register   qaq   then record into that register and call itself during the recording
[01:27:48] <hseg> how does that help me?
[01:28:07] <phy1729> The macro runs over and over until there's a beep
[01:28:50] <hseg> sure... but this is part of a larger macro
[01:30:14] <phy1729> I suppose you could nest a recursive macro in another macro if you need to
[01:30:19] <hseg> so I have one step replacing expressions of form c((t1)+(t2)+...+(tn)) with c(t1)+c(t2)+...+c(tn)+c(), then some cleanup, then rewriting the expression the way my code needs it, etc

[02:43:33] <gpanders> Cuddletron: go ahead and ask. No one minds beginner questions as long as they're well-asked and you're willing to do some research yourself
[02:47:12] <Cuddletron> Cool, thanks. I am wondering the best workflow for pasting over a bunch of instances of text (for renaming). I'm having an issue where when I paste (p) over a *selection* of text, it will indeed paste my buffer over that selection, but replace my buffer with whatever was selected
[02:47:51] <Cuddletron> Doing a search (/) and redo (.) doesn't seem to work for me, either.
[02:48:12] <gehn> Cuddletron, you might consider a good old "search and replace" instead which you can do with :%s/findthis/replacewiththis/g
[02:48:50] *** Joins: __jmcantrell__ (~weechat@user/jmcantrell)

[02:49:01] *** Quits: anon16 (~anon16@user/anon16) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:49:53] <nickspoon> Cuddletron: yeah visual p overwriting the selection is something you need to decide how you deal with. Either learn to work that way, or define your own process. I have a little function I use to preserve the register because I don't like that behaviour either
[02:50:37] <gpanders> Cuddletron: the behavior you're seeing is indeed the default and surprising to most new users. Using %s as gehn mentioned is probably the best way. If you add a 'c' to the end of the command they suggested it will also ask you to confirm each replacement which can be really helpful
[02:50:37] <Cuddletron> That would work for a lot of my uses. Is there a way that I can, instead of using this command which I assumes does it for all instances in the open document, have it search the document per instance and decide if I want to replace that instance or not?
[02:50:49] <gpanders> Cuddletron: ^
[02:50:52] <Cuddletron> Ah, there's my answer
[02:51:25] *** Joins: iomari891 (~iomari891@105.112.138.38)
[02:51:29] <gehn> you could get even more clever (but possibly more cumbersome)
[02:51:32] <gehn> first do a search with /
[02:51:53] *** Quits: jmcantrell (~weechat@user/jmcantrell) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[02:51:54] <gehn> then :s/<C-r>//replacewiththis/
[02:51:58] <nickspoon> Cuddletron: http://vpaste.net/6Ir0q
[02:52:05] <gehn> notably lacking the % which will cause the replacement to only occur on the current line
[02:52:10] <nickspoon> This might be a bit more than you want but I like it a lot
[02:52:24] <gehn> then hit n to get to each next match, if you want to do the replacement, : and hit the up arrow
[02:52:57] <nickspoon> first, p with a visual selection doesn't replace the register, so you can make another selection and p again
[02:53:40] <nickspoon> But also, the <space>p mapping searches for the previously selected text, and makes the same replacement
[02:54:13] *** Joins: anon16 (~anon16@user/anon16)
[02:54:44] <nickspoon> so it's sort of an alternate workflow to the  :%s///  way, where you make your visual selection and replacement, then repeat it, rather than thinking it all through with :s beforehand
[02:55:12] <Cuddletron> gehn, thanks for that. I think that probably is a bit much for me right now in my early stages. But the first find and replace seems great.
[02:55:21] <Cuddletron> nickspoon, I really like what you're describing
[02:56:00] <Cuddletron> How does one apply this function to Vim? It may or may not be possible for me, as I'm actually using VsVim, and I don't know what is supported in that environment
[02:56:10] <gehn> nothing
[02:56:25] <gpanders> Cuddletron: you can't use custom functions in VsVim

[02:57:06] <nickspoon> Ah yeah, I do use vsvim but only in emergencies :D
[02:57:23] <Cuddletron> I'm too much of a pleb. I rely on Visual Assist too much for my work
[02:57:39] <gehn> it's ok, we're all at where we're at
[02:57:53] <nickspoon> Cuddletron: coding c#?
[02:57:58] <gehn> fwiw, vim can do basically all that autocompletion stuff if you want it to
[02:58:07] <Cuddletron> No, I'm in games, so it's all the Unreal Engine macro stuff
[02:58:21] <nickspoon> What language is that?
[02:58:25] <Cuddletron> C++
[02:58:41] <gehn> vim tends to work very well with C++ in my experience
[02:58:51] <gehn> though if you're dealing with windows things are a bit more painful
[02:59:09] <gehn> Cuddletron, are you able to compile your game with clang?
[02:59:44] <Cuddletron> I'm actually not entirely sure, never looked into it
[03:00:00] <Cuddletron> Looks like you can
[03:00:19] <gehn> well, I mean, in theory you don't even really need to actually be able to 100% properly and fully build a working version
[03:00:35] <gehn> but you can get most features you'd probably have wanted from an IDE by integrating clang with vim in various ways
[03:00:37] <gehn> there's also LSP
[03:01:14] <nickspoon> Yeah LSP is the way to go
[03:01:30] <gehn> so as long as you can point clang to your correct include paths and give it your appropriate compile flags etc, it should work
[03:01:48] <gehn> but like, you don't need link flags, cuz you're not linking, it's just source analysis
[03:01:59] <Cuddletron> Well it's more that Unreal Engine has a massive amount of macro-based and meta-tagging stuff in the code, which is like half the code you're writing. And Visual Assist has libraries for all that stuff.
[03:02:03] <Cuddletron> That's why I'm reliant on it
[03:02:25] <Cuddletron> To call it C++ is kind of funny, because half the coding is done in macros
[03:02:25] <nickspoon> I would imagine an LSP server would still pick that stuff up?
[03:02:35] <nickspoon> But C++ is not my area, I don't know

[03:05:00] <nickspoon> The point of all this is that if you want to learn vim, you can't really do it in an emulator, you start hitting walls immediately
[03:05:00] <gehn> I can't guarantee it will give you the exact experience you have now, but it has more than most people probably realize in this regard

[03:12:31] <gehn> I'm not really trying to be a VSCode salesman, I prefer vim 100%
[03:12:48] <gehn> but it might be a better alternative if you do want to move to a more truly vim like environment
[03:13:02] <gehn> but not give up some of the visual-studio-ness you're used to
[03:13:38] <Cuddletron> I'll have to look into how possible it is. I do prefer Code in a lot of way because it's so much more lightweight.
[03:14:00] <Cuddletron> But Unreal has in VS a ton of pre-compilation steps with their own custom header tools
[03:14:07] <Cuddletron> Which has tied me to Visual Studio forever
[03:14:11] <ELLIOTTCABLE> as an ancient crotchety Vim-er: the VScode vi-plugin is genuinely fantastic
[03:14:15] <nickspoon> yeah. I learnt vim while waiting for Visual Studio to load lol
[03:14:18] <gehn> Cuddletron, not necessarily
[03:14:28] <gehn> Cuddletron, if you wanted to, you should be able to do all those builds from the command line
[03:14:29] <ELLIOTTCABLE> iirc when i last looked at it they were actually working on a neovim-frontend integration for arbitrary command execution, not sure if that's done
[03:14:41] <gehn> Cuddletron, visual studio is literally msbuild + cl.exe + GUI
[03:14:48] <gehn> like that's what vs project files are, they're msbuild files
[03:15:05] <gehn> so that means you could even run the build from vim (real vim)
[03:15:55] <gehn> you might be tied to visual studio the compiler, but you shouldn't necessarily be tied to visual studio the IDE GUI part of it

[03:16:17] <Cuddletron> I'm looking into it now - I think you're right, and I could compile with Code if I set it up properly
[03:16:36] <nickspoon> If you can do it in code, you can do it in vim :D
[03:16:47] <nickspoon> Which is much much more lightweight again
[03:16:51] <shgvbvri> one can avoid vs with: https://nosubstance.me/post/coding-windows-cpp-on-linux-2/
[03:16:51] <gehn> indeed
[03:17:06] <gehn> yeah VSCode feels really heavyweight to me
[03:18:06] <Cuddletron> hahaha, then Visual Studio must feel like driving a semi to you
[03:18:13] <gehn> pretty much
[03:18:32] <nickspoon> But. It's a fantastic debugger
[03:18:42] <gehn> yep
[03:19:12] <Cuddletron> Yeah, everyone at my studio who uses anything non VS still uses it for debugging
[03:19:21] <Cuddletron> The Vim guy, the emacs guy, and the Sublime guy
[03:19:25] <gehn> I don't :P
[03:19:26] <nickspoon> Now that we're finally migrating codebases over to .NET Core I can finally debug in vim, with vimspector and that is really really nice. But for years I've been using VS exclusively for debugging, all other C# coding in vim
[03:19:31] <gehn> cout << "got here" << endl;
[03:19:43] <Cuddletron> hahahah
[03:19:46] <gehn> 90% of the time it works every time
[03:19:54] <Cuddletron> No cout for us
[03:20:00] <Cuddletron> No STL in games
[03:20:11] <gehn> well, that also doesn't always work well in games
[03:20:29] <gehn> dumping millions of vertices is unlikely to help anyone debug anything
[03:20:30] <nickspoon> Cuddletron: https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector/  <- supports C++

[11:01:11] <mkoskar> though those are helpful combined with subsequent ^L to refine search without typing it out, not exactly jumping over matches
[11:01:32] <romainl> both
[11:03:38] <mkoskar> true, otoh confirming search and then n/N seems more convenient, I actually remapped ^T/^G to M-p/M-n
[11:04:56] <habamax> mkoskar: you could do it with tab/s-tab too
[11:04:58] <mkoskar> ^G is bit of a stretch, maybe I should learn to use right ctrl key, or get more ergonomic keyboard

[11:06:14] <romainl> To each their own. For me, a search is done when I have found what I searched so I prefer staying in "search mode" until I'm done. I had mappings on <tab> and <S-Tab> for that for many years before <C-g> and <C-t> were introduced
[11:06:21] <mkoskar> ah ye tab/s-tab might be good candidates too
[11:07:08] * romainl recognises those cnoremaps ;-)
[11:07:22] <habamax> it is yours, romainl
[11:08:45] <romainl> but FWIW, I don't use /? for "search" anyway, only for navigation
[11:10:00] <habamax> main usecase for me too
[11:11:27] <mkoskar> heh that idea fo nohlsearch on leaving cmdline is interesting, although can't relate, want my highlights so I can jump over them

[11:15:20] <mkoskar> sure, I came up with smt analogous, with exception of fallback in : to wildchar/m
[11:15:29] <mkoskar> that's a good idea
[11:17:24] <mkoskar> habamax: oh, I have it on space, nnoremap <Space> <Cmd>diffup! \| nohls \| echo<CR> ... added diffup! recently, got the idea for somewhere and then why not
[11:18:31] <habamax> space is my common prefix for a lot of mappings, but I had similar on <C-l>
[11:18:53] <habamax> nnoremap <silent> <C-l> :nohl<CR>:diffupdate<CR><C-l>
[11:20:11] <mkoskar> romainl: you say before ^T/^G, is there some function you would use in those mappings instead?
[11:22:13] <mkoskar> well I guess you could just <CR>n/<up> or smt like that
[11:23:05] <mkoskar> not exactly same since it would commit the search pattern tho
[11:26:30] <romainl> yes, something like that, the same at high level but different at a lower level
[11:27:58] *** lordrishav is now known as LordRishav
[11:28:01] <romainl> <C-t> and <C-g> are obviously cleaner so I changed my mapping to use them instead when they were introduced. The UX is maintained, which is what I value the most, here.

[12:35:00] <osse> In a file with only the string "Hello|World|foobar" in it and the cursor is on the word "World", searchpos('|', 'nz')  returns [1, 12]. It searches forward and finds a pipe in column 12. 
[12:36:46] <osse> But with the 'b' flag it does not find the first pipe. It actually returns the same answer. It seems to be that using 'b' starts searching at the start of the line. If I add a similar line above it, then it returns a value for that line.

[17:53:58] <phy1729> For some terminals (pangoterm and maybe specifically configured xterm) ctrl with and without shift is distinguishable

[17:55:15] <alzgh> phy1729 so in bash manuals and vim's when I see a combination starting with ctrl I don't care about the case of the following letters.
[17:55:24] <alzgh> It doesn't make a difference.
[17:56:03] <phy1729> You can see for yourself; run cat (no arguments) and hit ^V^a ^V^A
[17:56:28] <alzgh> I had `u`ed much work into oblivion and looking at the help for redo, I was kinda scared :D
[17:56:59] <alzgh> phy1729 I have experienced that with ^C and ^D also ^P I use a lot.
[17:57:14] <alzgh> there is no difference between case of letters
[17:58:16] <phy1729> some are special (<C-tab> is ^I but <C-S-tab> is some CSI sequence (but <C-S-I> is <C-I>))
