[00:50:08] <dimadima> of all the neat CSP directives, the neatest in a way is `form-action`, which you can set to `'none'` to prevent all form submission
[00:50:25] <dimadima> if your site is purely `fetch()` driven
[00:50:52] <dimadima> even security considerations aside, something about that was quite pleasant
[00:51:22] <dimadima> for example you can forget to `preventDefault()` on a form button, and it'll submit
[00:51:26] <dimadima> which is annoying

[01:30:19] <kline> every time
[01:31:47] <dimadima> i thought it was a split. is that irccloud going down

[04:55:44] <dimadima> i want to watch waterworld some day
[04:57:49] <manicennui> It's not as bad as people claim.
[04:59:24] <dimadima> i've had mixed experiences with such movies. some i've enjoyed a lot, some i found were as bad if not worse than people claimed
[04:59:33] <dimadima> one example for the latter category: biodome
[04:59:51] <manicennui> Can't remember whether I saw that.
[04:59:56] <manicennui> I won't claim that Waterworld is great.
[05:00:17] <manicennui> People seemed to get caught up in how much they spent on the movie. I don't know why people care so much about the financials of movies.
[05:01:01] <manicennui> It is definitely a Kevin Costner movie though. I think whether you like other Kevin Costner films from that era will be somewhat predictive.
[05:01:02] <dimadima> probably important if their financial resources are limited or if theylike to save money
[05:01:19] <manicennui> dimadima: Why is that important to the audience though?
[05:01:28] <manicennui> Some of the best movies had serious financial constraints.
[05:01:42] <manicennui> I don't think there is any correlation between movie quality and budget.
[05:01:43] <dimadima> oh wait i misunderstood
[05:01:49] <dimadima> you mean how much it cost to make? yeah that's irrelevant?
[05:01:59] <dimadima> i thought you meant how much it cost the consumer to consume it
[05:02:16] <manicennui> Waterworld's budget in 1995 was ~$175 million.
[05:02:18] <dimadima> i was pretty shocked to see movies on YT for $15
[05:02:23] <dimadima> wtf
[05:02:26] <dimadima> in 1995 dollars?
[05:02:30] <manicennui> Yes.
[05:02:40] <dimadima> damn
[05:02:55] <manicennui> Universal initially authorized a budget of $100 million,[note 1] which by mid-1994 had swollen to $135 million, with final costs reaching an estimated $175 million, a record sum for a film production at the time.[7]
[05:03:04] <dimadima> well to me that's interesting trivia but it doesn't affect my enjoyment one way or another
[05:03:09] <manicennui> Yeah.
[05:03:11] <dimadima> beyond "wtf they spent XXX on this movie and it SUCKS"
[05:03:16] <dimadima> or the other way
[05:03:45] <dimadima> i've only seen field of dreams and tbh i found that movie to be disturbing
[05:04:04] <dimadima> it kind of felt like he was experiencing a mental illness prodrome
[05:04:12] <dimadima> but ppl were romanticizing it
[05:04:48] <manicennui> I liked his Robin Hood at the time, but I haven't watched it in a long time.
[05:04:49] * dimadima is bad at, uh, suspending disbelief :)
[05:05:06] <manicennui> Dances with Wolves too
[05:05:21] <dimadima> i remember everonyed loved that but i never it cause iwas like, 5 or 6
[05:05:30] <dimadima> and then we didn't ever have cable
[05:05:34] <dimadima> i'd check that out
[05:05:39] <dimadima> but i'm def more interested in waterworld, but a lot
[05:05:39] <manicennui> I think his movies were generally decent but not amazing.
[05:05:42] <dimadima> by a lot*
[05:06:23] <manicennui> If you want to see him in something recent that is pretty good but also fucked up, watch Let Him Go.
[05:06:40] <manicennui> It is him and Diane Lane.
[05:06:44] <dimadima> hah nice
[05:07:14] <manicennui> I also liked The Highwaymen.
[05:07:28] <dimadima> my focus is on old shit to be honest
[05:08:03] <manicennui> The Highwaymen is about Bonnie and Clyde!
[05:08:10] <dimadima> hah
[05:08:18] <dimadima> yeah i'm on the wiki
[05:08:39] <dimadima> i don't care about those guys too much
[05:08:48] <dimadima> (bonnie and cylde)
[05:09:15] <dimadima> you ever watch old movies?
[05:09:21] <manicennui> Define old.
[05:09:26] <dimadima> pre-code, for example
[05:09:37] <manicennui> I don't know when that was exactly.
[05:09:41] <manicennui> 60s?
[05:09:46] <dimadima> if you don't want to fuck with happy endings, pre-code movies are your jam
[05:09:51] <dimadima> um like pre 1933
[05:09:56] <dimadima> but not silent films
[05:10:01] <dimadima> although they are technically pre-code
[05:10:04] <manicennui> Oh.
[05:10:10] <dimadima> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Code_Hollywood
[05:10:11] <buttsbot> Pre-Code Hollywood - Wikipedia
[05:10:28] <manicennui> No, not really.
[05:11:12] <dimadima> i've seen a few but if i were to watch some movies i'd watch some more pre-codes
[05:11:18] <dimadima> also 70s movies
[05:11:34] <dimadima> this genre https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Gun_McCain
[05:11:34] <buttsbot> Machine Gun McCain - Wikipedia
[05:11:56] <manicennui> There is just too much to watch.
[05:12:15] <dimadima> yeah
[05:12:19] <dimadima> pre-code movies are awsome cause
[05:12:20] <dimadima> As a result, some films in the late 1920s and early 1930s depicted or implied sexual innuendo, romantic and sexual relationships between white and black people, mild profanity, illegal drug use, promiscuity, prostitution, infidelity, abortion, intense violence, and homosexuality.
[05:12:22] <manicennui> I recently watched Promising Young Woman, which is a really interesting movie.
[05:12:25] <dimadima> lol
[05:12:32] <dimadima> like give me that real shit!
[05:12:50] <dimadima> yeah i saw you and gwozniak were talking about it
[05:13:01] <dimadima> ("lol" regarding those topics)
[05:13:19] <manicennui> You can find fucked up shit like that now. Watch Ema.
[05:13:25] <dimadima> black comedies are good
[05:13:29] <dimadima> for sure
[05:14:07] <dimadima> last pre-code movie i saw was a while back: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Nurse_(1931_film)
[05:14:08] <buttsbot> Night Nurse (1931 film) - Wikipedia
[05:14:15] <dimadima> dark and funny
[05:14:55] <dimadima> maybe not, uh, "funny"
[05:15:16] <dimadima> also this movie is one of my fav movies https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=gold+diggers+of+1933
[05:15:17] <buttsbot> gold diggers of 1933 - Google Search
[05:15:36] <dimadima> i put some clips up from it on vimeo but the took them down a little while ago
[05:16:18] <dimadima> fun thing about vimeo is if they take down a video, they let you download it for a period of time before deleting it. which i found was quite civilized on their behalf
[05:16:45] <dimadima> i like old stuff cause it's interesting to see what was going on
[05:16:58] <dimadima> after the holywood code the movies didn't really have that as much
[05:17:15] <dimadima> and contemporary movies aren't interesting on that level because i'm here today
[05:17:17] <manicennui> I do hate that movies try to avoid R ratings now.
[05:17:41] <manicennui> But I rarely enjoy "classics" from before the late 70s.
[05:17:59] <manicennui> dimadima: Maybe that's why I love weird movies.
[05:18:00] <dimadima> try gold diggers of 1933 lol
[05:18:39] <dimadima> it's a classic but it's not singing in the rain or miracle on 34th st or something
[05:19:03] <dimadima> although you have to be into dance numbers to like that one
[05:19:09] <manicennui> I might actually enjoy Singing in the Rain due to the singing and dancing.
[05:19:43] <dimadima> yeah i like dance numbers and musicals
[05:19:54] <dimadima> not as a category but when they're good they can be great
[05:20:11] <manicennui> The last season of Goliath has a great song and dance number with JK Simmons.

[05:22:13] <dimadima> can't risk my google accounts
[05:22:29] <manicennui> He is singing about pain killers.
[05:22:33] <dimadima> heh
[05:22:38] <manicennui> It's really great.
[05:23:08] <manicennui> Final season is about the opioid epidemic.
[05:23:27] <dimadima> i'm sincerely sure it's great but see cause i'm here
[05:23:29] <dimadima> it's like
[05:23:40] <dimadima> i don't want to watch stuff about stuff i'm already experiencing
[05:24:12] <manicennui> I'd love to see drug company execs sing about their products.
[05:24:24] <dimadima> fuck those guys
[05:24:47] <dimadima> opiods
[05:24:50] <dimadima> terrible
[05:25:10] <dimadima> the end of gold diggers of 1933 is about hoe we fuck veterans
[05:25:26] <manicennui> Goliath is justice porn.
[05:25:27] <dimadima> see, i know we do that nowadays, but i didn't know about consciousness of that back in the 30s

[05:40:06] <manicennui> Pretty good.
[05:40:13] <manicennui> Feels like a play.
[05:40:53] <manicennui> Wonder whether that is common with films from that period, or it is because it is based on a play.
[05:40:57] <dimadima> that's the last scene of the movie, which is basically about them rehearsing this play
[05:41:05] <dimadima> and producing it
[05:41:13] <dimadima> the scene is also the first black woman singing in a movie

[06:42:41] <dimadima> many good lines in there
[06:44:08] <dimadima> i remember back in the day when what.cd existed, they wanted to code a tracker and someone from the community came forward to do it in haskell. they took that person up on it
[06:44:21] <dimadima> and in acouple months were like "this is crazy, this went nowhere, will someone please write this in C"
[06:44:25] <dimadima> which someone promptly did
[06:44:31] <dimadima> and that was my first exposure to haskell
[06:45:08] <dimadima> that's a really high level executive summary but it was interesting/amusing
[07:01:14] *** Quits: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[07:11:06] <indigo> Back when I was a junior developer, I was really frustrated with our PHP codebase at work and thought "if only this was coded in Haskell we wouldn't be having these problems!!"
[07:14:28] <manicennui> And you were probably right. You'd probably have different problems.
[07:14:46] <indigo> Hahah perfect
[07:20:18] <imode> don't all haskell programs have some form of memory leak.
[07:20:31] <Church> Yes
[07:20:50] <imode> how the hell do people run xmonad.
[07:21:21] <companion_cube> imode: that might be a bit exaggerated, no?
[07:21:40] <imode> companion_cube: from what I've heard it's accurate.
[07:21:53] <companion_cube> like all C programs have segfaults? :)
[07:22:35] <imode> no like it's a known issue that hasn't been addressed, not just some programmer slinging dirt.
[07:23:23] <imode> there was an article about strict data in haskell to avoid the problem.
[07:23:42] <imode> forget where I saw it...
[07:24:07] <companion_cube> I think it's trickier than in a normal language with a GC
[07:24:12] <companion_cube> but it's not unavoidable
[07:24:34] <companion_cube> I mean, people write in swift where there's no cycle collector, for example, that's tricky too
[07:24:49] <imode> it's very difficult to avoid because of haskell's laziness if I remember the article correctly.
[07:24:54] <indigo> Is it because Haskell uses a bunch of immutable data, and so produces a ton of garbage for the GC?
[07:24:57] <indigo> Ahh
[07:25:06] <companion_cube> it's the laziness
[07:25:09] <indigo> I never liked Haskell's laziness; I always thought it made things hard to debug
[07:25:14] <imode> so much so that you need to pollute your entire program with strict data.
[07:25:17] <companion_cube> but it happens when you don't consume the stuff ever
[07:25:49] <companion_cube> xmonad probably doesn't produce that much garbage anyway
[07:26:08] <indigo> I always preferred dwm over xmonad... way less deps
[07:26:13] <imode> aha! http://h2.jaguarpaw.co.uk/posts/nested-strict-data/
[07:26:14] <buttsbot> nested-strict-data
[07:26:24] <imode> and the linked reddit thread alongside it.
[07:26:26] <imode> https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/pvosen/how_can_haskell_programmers_tolerate_space_leaks/.compact
[07:26:27] <buttsbot> How can Haskell programmers tolerate Space Leaks? : haskell
[07:26:39] <imode> that was also when I learned about the .compact path for every reddit thread... weird.
[07:27:14] <imode> so it's not just a "oh you encounter it sometimes", it's pretty damn common.
[07:27:22] <imode> and it's not because of poor programming.
[07:27:50] <indigo> Wow, .compact is like 2010 iPhone
[07:27:56] <imode> right?!
[07:31:45] <dimadima> i can't believe reddit keeps these old views around
[07:32:44] <indigo> What's the point of spending time turning down features when you can spend time building new ones???
[07:34:10] <companion_cube> imode: that's why Idris will win over haskellers, anyway :p
[07:34:21] <imode> companion_cube: does idris have less space leaks?
[07:34:37] <companion_cube> sure, it's strict
[07:34:45] <imode> oh, TIL. never looked at idris.
[07:34:53] <companion_cube> and dependent, so the types are even better
[07:35:04] <imode> oh cool I can hang the typechecker. :D
[07:35:07] <companion_cube> (the downside is that it's a research language, not production, oh well)
[07:35:20] <companion_cube> sure, you can hang the typechecker in any interesting language if you want to
[07:35:30] <imode> dependent types make typechecking undecidable.
[07:35:36] <companion_cube> doesn't matter
[07:35:48] <companion_cube> haskell's type inference is already undecidable in places
[07:35:53] <imode> ah fair.
[07:36:01] <companion_cube> OCaml's too, and in both cases you can make the typechecker take exponential time
[07:36:12] <companion_cube> (if you're trying to)
[07:36:47] <manicennui> I'm so happy to see that Hitler sparked a discussion of Haskell and type systems.
[07:37:01] <imode> wha
[07:37:24] <imode> oh.
[07:37:26] <imode> LMAO.
[07:37:37] <imode> I didn't even fuckin' realize that was posted.
[07:37:42] <imode> that's hilarious.
[07:38:21] <companion_cube> now we just need one for concatenative languages, heh? :)
[07:39:01] <dimadima> i really want to check out idris. dependent typing is how you'd think typing "should" be
[07:39:09] <manicennui> Do people really argue about concatenative languages though? =P
[07:39:15] <imode> not really.
[07:39:29] <companion_cube> dimadima: it's a neat theory, but it's hard to use in practice afaict
[07:40:15] <companion_cube> it's proof-assistant level of complexity
[07:40:31] <dimadima> yeah i saw some post the other day about using idris to prove something
[07:40:39] <dimadima> may be beyond my wheelhouse and actual programming goals :)
[07:41:06] <dimadima> but conceptually it's awesome
[07:41:31] <companion_cube> the style of idris is to use dependent types in a more basic way, I think
[07:41:44] <companion_cube> like state machines where transitions are type-checked
[07:41:48] <companion_cube> not full theorem proving
[07:41:50] * dimadima reads https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language
[07:41:50] <buttsbot> Concatenative programming language - Wikipedia
[07:42:36] <dimadima> companion_cube: have you tried it? or anything like it?
[07:42:47] <companion_cube> I've dabbled with Coq in the past
[07:43:03] <companion_cube> not too much, but I have a lot of friends into type theory
[07:43:59] <imode> if you enjoy phrasing your specs in terms of a particular logic, a journey through type theory is always welcome.
[07:45:19] <indigo> Sadly, dependent types will not help me with helping my stakeholders figure out what they want
[07:45:56] <imode> stakeholders are functors from garbage to garbage.
[07:46:01] <imode> don't worry.
[07:46:21] <dimadima> <3
[07:46:47] <indigo> Yesterday my team had a nice vent session about stakeholder requirements (or the lack of)... felt really nice :-)
[07:47:06] <imode> nice! we have that roughly every day internally through our slack channel.
[07:47:17] <imode> management has encouraged us to keep track of a shitlist.
[07:47:24] <imode> and act accordingly on that shitlist.
[07:47:48] <dimadima> what are possible ways to act accordingly?
[07:47:58] <imode> ignore, delegate, clarify.
[07:48:05] <imode> oh, and escalate.
[07:48:07] <imode> that's a fun one.
[07:48:17] <dimadima> and stakeholders <> management?
[07:48:18] <manicennui> Make up your own requirements and deliver them.
[07:48:42] <imode> dimadima: yup!
[07:48:48] <imode> stakeholders usually come to us first.
[07:49:05] <imode> then we get to decide what their fates are.
[07:50:26] <dimadima> that's nifty
[07:50:42] <companion_cube> imode is a functor from stakeholders to stackholders
[07:50:53] <companion_cube> gets concatenative on their asses
[07:59:29] <blissful> companion_cube: i'm learning coq right now in school :o
[07:59:40] <companion_cube> nice, do you like it?
[08:00:06] <blissful> i think it's amazingly cool, but i don't understand what's going on under the hood. still struggling to escape proof hacking
[08:00:29] <companion_cube> the type theory is pretty intense
[08:00:38] <blissful> we are working through pierce's software foundations
[08:00:44] <blissful> honestly i want more theory
[08:00:52] <blissful> even though the content feels like theory
[08:00:56] <blissful> i want the theory behind the theory
[08:00:58] <blissful> if that makes sense
[08:01:19] <companion_cube> hmm not sure exactly
[08:01:20] <blissful> feels like he leaves the reader to piece that together themselves, but i'm a lazy shit
[08:01:27] <imode> go pick up a logic textbook.
[08:01:31] <companion_cube> well, the core type system is as deep as it gets
[08:01:44] <blissful> more like how Coq does it internally and what each tactic _does_ and why
[08:01:48] <companion_cube> but SF doesn't really get to it
[08:01:50] <companion_cube> well
[08:02:01] <companion_cube> there's the kernel, which typechecks, and that's all (a few klocs of OCaml)
[08:02:09] <companion_cube> and the rest is layers and layers of stuff for usability, like tactics
[08:02:27] <companion_cube> which mostly take goals and return new goals along with proof transformers
[08:03:23] <blissful> imode: any recs? i have the ltitle typer in my list, and i can resume tapl, which i paused earlier to read some other books.
[08:03:34] <blissful> which is not exactly logic, but related to pLT
[08:03:49] <companion_cube> there's Coq'Art as an older book on Coq
[08:03:54] <imode> blissful: type theory and logic are heavily intertwined.
[08:03:58] <companion_cube> by some of the core contributors from a while ago
[08:04:03] <imode> no real recommendations.
[08:04:13] <blissful> imode: huh, interesting, i did not realize
[08:04:17] <blissful> i am rather new
[08:04:46] <blissful> basically a software engineer who found this stuff cool and is splashing around :-D
[08:04:48] <imode> a particular type theory has a matching logic.
[08:05:05] <companion_cube> some logics, though, don't really correspond to a type theory
[08:05:26] <imode> not one that we're aware of right now, anyway.
[08:06:01] <companion_cube> i'd say that classical logic with choice doesn't have a nice type theory to go along :p
[08:06:09] <companion_cube> you need to add ugly axioms, etc.
[08:06:16] <companion_cube> and you lose reduction
[08:06:25] <blissful> trying to make sure im looking for something at the appropraite level of depth
[08:06:26] <companion_cube> so at that point why bother with the type theory
[08:06:28] <imode> curry-howard says something corresponds to that, though.
[08:06:36] <blissful> https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/558295.Fundamentals_of_Mathematical_Logic a book along these lines?
[08:06:36] <buttsbot> Fundamentals of Mathematical Logic by Peter G. Hinman
[08:06:46] <imode> probably.
[08:06:51] <blissful> thx
[08:06:54] <companion_cube> imode: curry-howard is overrated :p
[08:07:05] <companion_cube> I wrote a stupid blogpost with that title a while ago
[08:07:14] <imode> curry-howard is.. why half the shit you say you use/enjoy exists. :P
[08:07:18] <companion_cube> nah
[08:07:21] <imode> oookay.
[08:07:24] <blissful> companion_cube: Coq'Art's table of contents feels much more familiar than software foundations
[08:07:33] <blissful> like a typical textbook
[08:07:34] <imode> if you say so~
[08:07:38] <companion_cube> curry-howard is for intuitionist fans :)
[08:07:48] <companion_cube> I like classical logic, where no one cares about CH
[08:08:02] <imode> there's nothing special about intuitionistic logic for CH.
[08:08:08] <blissful> i like if statements, makes stakeholders money ._.
[08:08:18] <imode> that's just how it started.
[08:08:44] <companion_cube> CH might exist for classical logic, but it's useless afaict
[08:09:01] <imode> apparently not.
[08:09:11] <imode> "In particular, classical logic has been shown to correspond to the ability to manipulate the continuation of programs and the symmetry of sequent calculus to express the duality between the two evaluation strategies known as call-by-name and call-by-value."
[08:09:20] <imode> huh, I have to find an example of that.. that's kind of neat.
[08:09:35] <imode> no citations. that sucks.
[08:10:06] <imode> but yeah, there are practical uses for non-constructivist logics.
[08:10:09] <imode> even paraconsistent ones.
[08:10:09] <companion_cube> my point about CH has been, and is still, that programs prove boring theorems, and theorems have useless programs as proofs
[08:10:20] <companion_cube> so the isomorphism is pretty useless
[08:10:44] <imode> "theorems have useless programs as proofs"... then literally all of typing is useless. :D
[08:11:03] <companion_cube> no, the types are useful, they're just not interesting mathematical proofs
[08:11:11] <companion_cube> statements*
[08:11:16] <imode> define interesting.
[08:11:24] <companion_cube> something you'd find in a math textbook
[08:11:36] <imode> you might want to expand your horizons a bit.
[08:11:40] <imode> lots of this stuff is nontrivial.
[08:11:52] <companion_cube> the types for an actual program, mind you
[08:11:57] <imode> for someone who's a proponent of these ideas those statements are pretty weird.
[08:12:05] <companion_cube> conversely proofs of a mathematical theorem are programs that are useless
[08:12:09] <companion_cube> except as a proof
[08:12:23] <companion_cube> well I like types for programming, they're just not proofs of anything
[08:12:37] <imode> uh, can you define the word "proof" as you're using it.
[08:12:44] <companion_cube> what's the deep mathematical truth behind `hashmap<T,U> -> T -> option<U>` anyway
[08:12:52] <imode> that's... not the point.
[08:12:56] <companion_cube> what is the point then
[08:13:05] <imode> I see you're one o' them surface type people.
[08:13:11] <imode> while the rest of us are CHUDs.
[08:13:20] <companion_cube> chuds?
[08:13:32] <imode> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.H.U.D.
[08:13:33] <buttsbot> C.H.U.D. - Wikipedia
[08:13:48] <companion_cube> okayyy
[08:14:03] * manicennui doesn't understand this analogy.
[08:14:26] <imode> comedy aside, there's not supposed to be a "deep mathematical truth" behind any of these proofs. the whole point is that your programs have some sort of structure that can be coerced to fit together in certain ways by type overlays.
[08:14:37] <imode> ...similar to a formal proof.
[08:15:01] <companion_cube> sure, but that only works as a proof if you have, well, Coq|Idris|Lean
[08:15:05] * manicennui proves that his software makes fucktons of money.
[08:15:13] <companion_cube> cause otherwise the types don't prove anything
[08:15:17] <indigo> That’s what really matters
[08:15:19] <manicennui> And it's written in Ruby.
[08:15:23] <companion_cube> (except perhaps "no type error at runtime", which is at least sth)
[08:15:25] <manicennui> Where is your god now?
[08:16:02] <imode> the whole idea is that the actual structure of formal proofs in various logics only allow for certain programs to be constructed, pruning the "search space", as it were, of someone writing or extending a program, or writing or extending a proof.
[08:16:34] <companion_cube> on paper, sure
[08:16:37] <imode> different proof systems/styles pair with different logics, which pair with different styles of "programming", which have a type theory.
[08:16:53] <indigo> We had a fun saying at my last company: “we aren’t NASA”
[08:17:06] <companion_cube> and in practice, I write OCaml, which is not even first-order, and has some inconsistent axioms like `raise : exn -> 'a`
[08:17:23] <imode> it means you can turn a lot of your business logic into "how can I describe the holes I want things to fit into, and then write things that conform to that shape so that things fit into the holes".
[08:17:40] <imode> I can't believe I'm being an advocate of formal shit to you considering I'm the Forth guy lmao.
[08:17:44] <companion_cube> if you write your business software in Coq, sure
[08:17:55] <imode> you don't have to use Coq... I don't know where you get that.
[08:18:00] <imode> calculus of constructions is just one system.
[08:18:08] <companion_cube> well, Coq has consistent types :)
[08:18:21] <companion_cube> not the case for most (all?) the programming languages in use for actual programming
[08:18:23] <imode> and yet it's just one system.
[08:18:37] <companion_cube> one of the few where proofs are reliable
[08:19:01] <companion_cube> I like types, I just don't think they're proofs following a nice logic
[08:19:05] <imode> the reason I said you were a "surface level" person is because I don't think you grasp 1. the implications of the things I'm talking about and 2. how people can/have actually used these outside of ivory towers.
[08:19:22] <imode> meaning, you have friends who are into type theory, but you aren't. :P
[08:19:38] <companion_cube> I know enough, I think
[08:19:41] <companion_cube> I doubt 2. though
[08:19:47] <imode> I mean.
[08:19:55] <companion_cube> proving stuff in inconsistent logics isn't interesting
[08:20:09] <imode> what inconsistent logics do we prove things in.
[08:20:12] <companion_cube> and again, most practical type systems are deeply inconsitent
[08:20:26] <imode> that's a fair assumption but lacks substance in many cases.
[08:20:26] <companion_cube> give me a typed language and I'll show you a proof of false
[08:20:34] <companion_cube> (outside of Coq and the likes)
[08:20:42] <imode> do C.
[08:20:46] <companion_cube> :DDDD
[08:20:53] <companion_cube> there's not even… ugh…
[08:20:57] <imode> LMAO.
[08:21:15] <companion_cube> please tell me what CH is for C, first
[08:21:24] <imode> to be fuckin' honest I don't know.
[08:21:28] <companion_cube> cause the only proof I can express in it is `'a -> void*`
[08:21:30] <imode> you have records, so..
[08:21:42] <imode> maybe consult Frama-C?
[08:21:47] <companion_cube> not a type system
[08:22:46] <imode> now you have me curious as to what a proof of false would be.
[08:22:54] <companion_cube> typically, a proof of `forall a. a`
[08:22:58] <manicennui> I didn't realize that Ruby added a built-in compose method.
[08:23:05] <manicennui> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/uIs86uRv/
[08:23:05] <buttsbot> Snippet | IRCCloud
[08:23:10] <companion_cube> or `forall a. some_basic_thing -> a` if you need suspension
[08:23:11] <imode> right but...
[08:23:19] <imode> there's like.
[08:23:22] <imode> hm.
[08:23:29] <companion_cube> in C you can't write the forall so… uh… you're safe? :D
[08:23:39] <imode> yeah I was gonna say there's no fuckin quantifiers lmao.
[08:23:54] <companion_cube> you might say that "noreturn" is false
[08:23:58] <companion_cube> and use exit()
[08:24:22] <imode> it can't be simple propositional logic.
[08:24:23] <companion_cube> for more interesting stuff, haskell gives you this type easily with exceptions or infinite loops
[08:24:28] <companion_cube> OCaml as well
[08:24:40] <imode> right, those are trivial to express.
[08:24:42] <companion_cube> rust, I'm less sure but it's doable with a panic() I think
[08:26:21] <imode> I do know that Forth is all linear logic. :P
[08:26:23] <companion_cube> ah well, yes, panic!() will have any type you want
[08:26:37] <companion_cube> fn false<T>() -> T { panic!() }
[08:26:43] <imode> and is a function over the integers, as god intended.
[08:27:18] <imode> and we even have an undefined bound on those integers, so the finitists are happy.
[08:27:24] <companion_cube> :D
[08:27:35] <companion_cube> people who need a hobby
[08:27:40] <imode> fuckin right
[08:27:41] <imode> lmao.
[08:28:13] <imode> "640k is good enough" is exactly what a finitist would say.
[08:28:27] <companion_cube> that said, quantifiers are a pain
[08:28:50] <imode> well yeah anything first-order is a bitch.
[08:29:12] <imode> the further you get away from basic sentential logic the worse your life is.
[08:29:49] <companion_cube> honestly what I want to see in type systems, is refinement types
[08:30:15] <companion_cube> but that requires embedding a SMT solver in the compiler, which is brittle engineering
[08:30:18] <companion_cube> well
[08:30:23] <companion_cube> which brings a lot of complexity
[08:30:35] <imode> pfft.
[08:30:39] <imode> just embed CHR.
[08:30:49] <imode> good enough for finance.
[08:31:46] <companion_cube> hu, never heard of that before ? wtfd
[08:32:07] <companion_cube> that a kind of prolog?
[08:32:24] <imode> it walks hand-in-hand with it.
[08:32:30] <companion_cube> although I wonder if it's the thing in elpi
[08:32:50] <companion_cube> ahhh yes
[08:33:13] <imode> prolog is oriented towards backward chaining, which makes your fact base immutable over time (unless you use assert/retract).
[08:33:18] <imode> CHR is forward chaining.
[08:33:22] <companion_cube> yeah yeah
[08:33:23] <imode> which means the fact base is modified.
[08:33:28] <companion_cube> elpi is lambda-prolog + CHR
[08:33:43] <imode> neat, got a link?
[08:33:45] <companion_cube> (well, lambda prolog already has a bit of local addition because of lambdas)
[08:33:47] <companion_cube> https://github.com/LPCIC/elpi/
[08:33:48] <buttsbot> GitHub - LPCIC/elpi: Embeddable Lambda Prolog Interpreter
[08:33:58] <companion_cube> it's very interesting
[08:34:03] <imode> ah lit.
[08:34:08] <companion_cube> they're embedding it into Coq to write tactics/refiners in it
[08:34:21] <imode> _that_ is a task.
[08:34:23] <companion_cube> which makes sense, lambda prolog is well suited to representing type checkers
[08:34:41] <companion_cube> well one of the core contributors is Enrico Tassi
[08:34:42] <imode> not surprising, regular prolog with uhhhhh what the fuck is that extension...
[08:34:49] <imode> anyway, it's great for parsing.
[08:34:51] <companion_cube> lambda prolog has types!! :p
[08:34:59] <companion_cube> (and… lambdas…)
[08:35:23] <imode> there's this intertwining relationship between grammars, automata, logic and types that goes back way further than anybody usually contemplates.
[08:35:37] <imode> everything is just a fancy parser.
[08:36:45] <companion_cube> automata ⊆ parsers ⊆ types ⊆ logic ;)
[08:37:18] <companion_cube> my real deal, tbh, is computational logic, where it also matters that you solve stuff efficiently
[08:37:32] <companion_cube> and there people have long focused on classical logic because it's somewhat easier
[08:37:49] <imode> axiom of choice baybee.
[08:38:02] <companion_cube> even just excluded middle goes a long way
[08:38:08] <imode> also that expression you just wrote is circular.
[08:38:10] <companion_cube> proof by contradiction is the magic trick
[08:42:30] <companion_cube> anywya, good night
[08:42:38] <imode> cheers, nice talkin' as usual.
[08:42:48] <companion_cube> :)
[08:43:04] <manicennui> Even if you are a CHUD.
[08:43:23] <imode> I am a CHUD. he's a surface dweller.
[08:43:33] <manicennui> Oh.
[08:43:40] <manicennui> Is this similar to Time Machine?
[08:43:49] <imode> time machine?
[08:44:26] <manicennui> The morlocs and the eloi.
[08:44:35] <manicennui> morlocks

[08:44:44] <buttsbot> The Time Machine - Wikipedia
[08:45:01] <imode> oh!
[08:45:23] <manicennui> The morlocks even eat the eloi.
[08:45:31] <imode> yeah it's similar lmao.
[08:46:31] <manicennui> C.H.U.D. II: Bud the C.H.U.D.
[08:46:45] <manicennui> That is seriously the name of the sequel.
[08:46:49] <imode> are you-
[08:46:52] <imode> LMAO
[08:47:44] <manicennui> Oh.
[08:47:53] <manicennui> CHUD is included with Prime.
[08:49:52] <imode> unrelated. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtl1S0kUMEw
[08:49:53] <buttsbot> Com Truise - Ultrafiche of You (Official Video) - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtl1S0kUMEw
[08:51:34] <manicennui> Seth Haley, known by his stage name Com Truise is an American electronic musician.[3] His stage name is a spoonerism of the name of American actor Tom Cruise.[4]
[08:51:39] <manicennui> Spoonerism, eh?
[08:51:44] <manicennui> Never heard that word.
[08:52:07] <imode> I didn't either until I searched him up.
[08:52:12] <bkero> You've certainly heard spoonerisms though
[08:52:28] <manicennui> An example is saying "The Lord is a shoving leopard" instead of "The Lord is a loving shepherd."
[08:52:32] <manicennui> I prefer a leopard lord.
[08:53:28] <bkero> Good enough for Narnia.
[08:54:02] <manicennui> This seems like it could be a song from CHUD.
[08:54:35] <manicennui> Nice video.
[08:54:45] <imode> definitely a meaningful one.
[08:55:32] <manicennui> I'll have to remember to listen to more Com Truise

[08:56:15] <buttsbot> Hyperlips - YouTube - https://youtu.be/s82bOprBcoU
[08:56:56] <manicennui> His music definitely seems like it would work well as soundtrack music for movies from the 80s.
[08:57:12] <manicennui> (this is a good thing IMHO)
[09:03:40] <manicennui> There is something about movies from the 50s and 60s that I really like, but I can't put my finger on it.
[09:03:46] <manicennui> Planet of the Apes is a great example.
[09:06:15] <imode> what parts of the aesthetic are you into?
[09:06:55] <manicennui> It's not just the aesthetic.
[09:07:57] <manicennui> The acting is more like a play, if you know what I mean.
[09:08:09] <manicennui> But also the lack of CGI I think.

[09:12:15] <manicennui> He described how the writers would just insert "tech" into the scripts whenever they needed to resolve a story or plot line, then they'd have consultants fill in the appropriate words (aka technobabble) later.
[09:12:18] <manicennui> I hate that shit.
[09:12:38] <manicennui> They do it a lot on SG-1.

[19:28:40] <manicennui> Well there is your problem.
[19:28:41] <companion_cube> I mean there's pretty decent stuff, and we ahven't been downtown much
[19:28:57] <manicennui> There is a French bakery a block from me.
[19:29:29] <companion_cube> sadly I've never found a good baguette in the US
[19:29:45] <indigo> I get my baguettes from a local bakery here in LA
[19:29:55] <indigo> But they're not what you would call "traditional" as they are sourdough
[19:30:01] <dimadima> i've never understood why ikea doesn't just open its restaurants standalone. i understand they're loss leaders and all, but still
[19:30:05] <bkero> mmm
[19:30:08] <companion_cube> it's probably good, indigo
[19:30:08] <dimadima> they can go lead loss elsewhere

[19:30:09] <buttsbot> French bread and pastry - La Boulangerie Chicago
[19:30:13] <companion_cube> I'm not saying there isn't good bread
[19:30:19] <companion_cube> but there's no good french bread afaict
[19:30:22] <indigo> https://gjusta.com/
[19:30:22] <buttsbot> Gjusta
[19:30:29] <companion_cube> and the pastries are generally not as good
[19:30:40] <dimadima> indigo: yes pizza hut
[19:30:57] <indigo> manicennui: Fun, the baguette prices are around the same for yours and mine
[19:31:06] <manicennui> companion_cube: This place has great French bread, and there are a couple of others in the city.
[19:31:13] <companion_cube> manicennui: heh, the tradition doesn't look bad actually
[19:31:14] <indigo> I always thought it was expensive but now I guess you just need to pay premiums for good bread
[19:32:04] <manicennui> And as far as pizza, this place is a couple blocks away: https://www.spaccanapolipizzeria.com/
[19:32:05] <buttsbot> Spacca Napoli
[19:32:25] <companion_cube> does Chicago have a reputation for good food?
[19:32:38] <manicennui> Absolutely.
[19:32:47] <manicennui> I can't tell whether you are trolling me now.
[19:32:51] <companion_cube> I hope I can visit some day
[19:32:58] <companion_cube> manicennui: I'm not american
[19:33:05] <companion_cube> I don't have a list of the reputation of each city :p
[19:33:07] <manicennui> Alinea is considered to be one of the best restaurants in the world.
[19:33:29] <companion_cube> I mean food for normal people :p
[19:33:38] <manicennui> The key to eating in Chicago is to avoid the crap that tourists come here for.
[19:33:42] <companion_cube> idgaf about michelin star restaurants, tbh
[19:33:48] <manicennui> companion_cube: We have everything.
[19:33:49] <indigo> What's your opinion on deep dish pizza
[19:34:04] <manicennui> You really can't compare Chicago to any city in Texas.
[19:34:14] <manicennui> indigo: Mediocre and I never eat it.
[19:34:23] <manicennui> Locals don't tend to eat it much.
[19:34:28] <companion_cube> Texas has … good texmex
[19:34:31] <manicennui> Meaning people who live in the city.
[19:34:43] <manicennui> companion_cube: You can get good texmex all over though.
[19:34:44] <indigo> What about chicago dogs
[19:34:45] <companion_cube> but yeah, even my fiancée told me to not expect much from bagels and pizzas there 😂
[19:34:54] <companion_cube> manicennui: so you say :p
[19:34:58] <manicennui> indigo: Decent.
[19:35:00] <companion_cube> texmex in France I'd avoid, for example
[19:35:10] <manicennui> companion_cube: I meant in the US.
[19:35:10] <indigo> There was a good chicago dog place in SD
[19:35:17] <manicennui> I know of good texmex in the Ozarks.
[19:35:18] <companion_cube> hard to find good salsa and good tortillas
[19:35:51] <manicennui> We also have half a million Mexicans here.
[19:36:01] <manicennui> So we have great Mexican and texmex.
[19:37:24] <manicennui> We also Michelin starred Mexican restaurants.
[19:37:27] <manicennui> also have

[19:37:55] <buttsbot> Rick BaylessTopolobampo - Rick Bayless

[19:39:34] <manicennui> And then he has some even more affordable places that specialize in different things.
[19:40:26] <companion_cube> damn it is affordable
[19:40:54] <companion_cube> portobello tacos, sounds nice
[19:40:58] <companion_cube> well TIL
[19:41:05] <companion_cube> if I ever have the opportunity to visit Chicago…
[19:42:23] <dimadima> what makes a chicago dog? onions?
[19:42:36] <manicennui> dimadima: No, it is half a dozen toppings, and no ketchup.
[19:43:03] <manicennui> "A Chicago-style hot dog, Chicago Dog, or Chicago Red Hot is an all-beef frankfurter[1][3] on a poppy seed bun,[4][5] originating from the city of Chicago, Illinois.[6][7] The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, bright green sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices or wedges, pickled sport peppers and a dash of celery salt."
[19:43:32] <manicennui> The only thing I disagree with is the tomato slices. They are never good tomatoes.
[19:43:36] <dimadima> that's very specific
[19:43:46] <manicennui> I always pull off the tomatoes and pickle and eat them separately.
[19:43:50] <companion_cube> lots of pickling…
[19:44:55] <manicennui> I honestly don't think they are that amazing, but once in a while I have one.
[19:45:19] <manicennui> The only thing I'd maybe try if I came here is an Italian beef.
[19:46:05] <manicennui> But I'd much rather just eat the great food we have that isn't as stereotypical.
[19:46:22] <manicennui> I'd put our Texas BBQ up against Texas frankly.
[19:46:46] <manicennui> And I know our BBQ is every bit as good as anything in NC.
[19:47:10] <companion_cube> can't judge that, but Texans would be mad at you :)
[19:47:27] <manicennui> I'm sure they would.
[19:47:33] <manicennui> People need to be less precious about such things.
[19:47:56] <manicennui> There are a fuckton of people here for all over.
[19:48:16] <manicennui> And we are able to support a large number of great restaurants.
[19:48:19] <companion_cube> yeah but can you train in BBQ all year long? :D
[19:48:48] <manicennui> I'm sure there are people here who do.
[19:49:58] <manicennui> There might be a very specific item that is harder to find here.
[19:50:36] <manicennui> But you can get burnt ends and everything else.
[19:51:03] <manicennui> Smoque and Blackwood are easily better than most of the BBQ in the US outside of a few areas.

[19:52:09] <buttsbot> Photos for Blackwood BBQ - Yelp
[19:55:45] <manicennui> I think sushi might be one of the few types of food where you can get a lot of really good food here, but nothing amazing.
[19:55:59] <manicennui> A lot of the Japanese restaurants in Chicago are actually run by Koreans.
[19:57:24] <manicennui> companion_cube: I think that the people at this French bakery near me are actually French.
[19:57:35] <manicennui> It is also right next to a French elementary school.

[20:01:24] <companion_cube> manicennui: it's sadly not enough :)
[20:01:31] <companion_cube> even in France the bakeries vary in quality
[20:01:38] <companion_cube> sad but true
[20:01:39] <manicennui> Sure.
[20:01:47] <companion_cube> that said it's probably at least pretty decent
[20:02:19] <manicennui> This is the guy behind it: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-colombet-716a357
[20:02:38] <companion_cube> login wall… but french name
[20:02:55] <manicennui> He is Alsacian.
[20:03:18] <manicennui> About:
[20:03:21] <manicennui> The countless hours spent with my Alsacian grandmother in her tiny kitchen, learning our family’s secret recipes inspired me to become a Chef. With my cousins I used to hand-picked mountain blueberries for her pies; we ate meat and cheeses from neighboring farms; and by the age of 18 I was preparing elaborate meals for my family with only our wood-burning, cast-iron stove.
[20:03:21] <manicennui> After completing my training in Paris, I yearned for experiences abroad and moved to Chicago in 2004. My passion for creating traditional French, family-style meals and one-bite appetizers with an artistic flair inspired me to open Cook Au Vin the following year. Since opening that first business, the team became locally recognized for our savory crepes, pastries, and bread. Then I created La Boulangerie - Logan, and La
[20:03:21] <manicennui> Boulangerie - Wilson, now known as La Boulangerie & Co.
[20:03:22] <manicennui> Our team thrives for delivering dining experiences that transport diners to my native French countryside and the finest restaurants in Paris. A goal that we achieve thanks to our organic products, French flour, dedication, and passion for what we do!
[20:03:26] <manicennui> Oh fuck
[20:03:31] <manicennui> How did I not get booted?
[20:03:38] <manicennui> I meant to use a snippet.
[20:03:40] <manicennui> Sorry about that.

[20:13:18] <manicennui> I tried to read Accelerate, but it spends far too much time explaining their methodology.
[20:13:40] <manicennui> Would be fine if that content was all in one chapter, but it is sprinkled through the entire book.
[20:13:44] <manicennui> I just want to read about their findings.
[20:14:40] <manicennui> I think the DevOps annual reports might be what I want.
[20:14:55] <manicennui> This seems to dive into details about them that I'm not really interested in.

[20:27:21] <prussian> ugh, DEV OOPS
[20:27:37] <prussian> bkero: apparently that limit order I placed on SHMP finally filled.
[20:27:52] <prussian> didn't you mention it? or am I going crazy?
[20:27:57] <bkero> I did.
[20:28:05] <bkero> How's yer SHROMPERS?
[20:28:18] <prussian> idk lol. I guess up ~4%
[20:28:49] <manicennui> heh
[20:28:57] <manicennui> How long ago did you place it?
[20:29:05] <prussian> like. forever ago. when it was mentioned.
[20:29:13] <manicennui> It didn't expire after a day?
[20:29:21] <prussian> set it to good til canceled.
[20:29:27] <manicennui> heh
[20:29:29] <prussian> and forgot
[20:29:53] <prussian> time to go all in now, of course.
[20:30:05] <bkero> Hopefully you didn't snag it on the way down.

[20:35:17] <manicennui> gerikson: I saw that. Andersonville is pretty great. I don't know that it is my favorite neighborhood.

[20:38:34] <companion_cube> oh imode
[20:38:40] <companion_cube> thanks for the CHR pointer, it's quite cool really
[20:38:41] <manicennui> Andersonville is not exactly a neighborhood people visit when they come to Chicago.
[20:38:58] <imode> companion_cube: np dude.
[20:39:02] <manicennui> I don't know about Chelsea in NYC.
[20:39:17] <imode> I'm surprised to see nothing about Seattle in that list.
[20:39:18] <manicennui> I assume that is mostly a place that hipsters live.
[20:39:23] <imode> wait no I'm not, fuck seattle.
[20:39:46] <bkero> Seattle has a few good places. Those places aren't neighborhoods.
[20:39:52] <bkero> Chuck's is great.

[20:40:46] <imode> lmaooo.
[20:40:48] <dimadima> chelsea sucks
[20:40:49] <bkero> Well curated
[20:40:51] <manicennui> I'd argue that the great parts of Chicago are generally not entire neighborhoods.

[20:41:36] <imode> 20 miles from civilization on a private road.

[20:47:25] <prussian> $0.35
[20:47:45] <imode> assuming you're okay with taking a hit on the fees I'd fuck off at EOD.
[20:48:07] <manicennui> What fees?
[20:48:14] <imode> brokers typically charge commission.

[20:52:29] <manicennui> Lamb came out today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnEwJKVWjFM
[20:52:29] <buttsbot> Lamb | Official Trailer HD | A24 - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnEwJKVWjFM
[20:53:18] <imode> it's A24, it's gonna be a fun time.
[20:54:19] <imode> what the fuck.
[20:54:25] <manicennui> Yeah, exactly.
[20:54:27] <manicennui> I want to see it.
[20:55:42] <dimadima> gerikson: just looked at the replied to your math joke by the way. holy shit
[20:56:30] <imode> well that was terrifying.
[21:02:48] <bkero> imode: the Transmet page?
[21:10:58] <imode> lamb trailer.
[21:14:04] <manicennui> "High school students are rallying behind their metalhead principal after a number of concerned parents have been petitioning to have her removed for stating on her personal Instagram profile that she listens to IRON MAIDEN."
[21:14:06] <manicennui> ...
[21:14:12] <manicennui> Why do humans suck so fucking much?
[21:14:29] <companion_cube> :D damn

[21:14:58] <drakonis> holy fuck lmfao
[21:15:03] <drakonis> this is some horrible stuff
[21:15:34] <gwozniak> manicennui: is it time for 80s metal scare again?
[21:16:03] <manicennui> gwozniak: I'm guessing those people never went away; we just stopped listening to them.
[21:17:14] <imode> and started listening to hetfield.
[21:17:41] <manicennui> I feel like being offended by things like heavy metal is a sure sign that you are a troglodyte.
[21:17:51] <companion_cube> or satanism
[21:18:24] <imode> there was a recent post somewhere on the internet that said that nuns were molesting kids with crucifixes.
[21:18:37] <manicennui> imode: That was just a test from God!
[21:18:48] <manicennui> They always excuse their own.
[21:19:00] <manicennui> Except that most American Christians hate Catholics too.
[21:19:02] <imode> projection runs deep.
[21:19:48] <manicennui> Trump could admit that he fucked many teens on Epstein's island, and they'd forgive him.
[21:21:00] <manicennui> He could even say that he is not sorry for it and he'd do it again and they wouldn't care.
[21:22:12] <manicennui> Save us young people!
[21:23:44] <manicennui> I want to get to the point where religious politicians are seen as nuts, like some European countries.
[21:24:00] <indigo> I think young people are just disillusioned with politics in general
[21:24:30] <manicennui> It's a numbers game. We just need enough people who aren't near death to vote.
[21:24:44] <indigo> I think they're expecting someone like Obama or AOC to run
[21:25:10] <companion_cube> it's not a number game since it's not universal suffrage
[21:25:15] <companion_cube> electoral college fucks you up
[21:25:26] <manicennui> companion_cube: There are enough young people who are progressive to win elections.
[21:25:39] <manicennui> Who haven't been disenfranchised.
[21:25:50] <companion_cube> do senate elections have a district system, too?
[21:25:52] <indigo> Well, hopefully we get NPV soon
[21:25:55] <indigo> https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/state-status
[21:25:55] <buttsbot> Status of National Popular Vote Bill in Each State | National Popular Vote
[21:26:29] <manicennui> The best way to make something like that happen is to first vote out a fuckton of Republicans and move the Democratic party to the left.
[21:26:58] <manicennui> State and local elections in particular.
[21:27:18] <indigo> If we rewrote our electoral college in Rust, we wouldn't be having these problems
[21:27:34] <companion_cube> :D
[21:27:49] <manicennui> indigo: Except that candidate party would have been an enum with two values.
[21:29:52] <manicennui> drakonis: The code is the least of the problems...
[21:30:00] <manicennui> Isn't this a tool for spamming people?
[21:30:04] <drakonis> yes
[21:30:06] <drakonis> yes it is
[21:30:17] <manicennui> "Do Not Use This To Harm Others."
[21:30:35] <manicennui> "This script is Only for Educational Purposes or to prank."
[21:30:55] <drakonis> i shit you not
[21:31:51] <manicennui> There are special character sequences sprinkled throughout the code.
[21:32:05] <manicennui> There are methods defined in the middle of the script and then the script continues afterward.
[21:33:10] <manicennui> Methods defined in the if block. Nice.
[21:33:12] <drakonis> its horrible
[21:34:36] <manicennui> It also instructs you to install this: https://github.com/Sl-Sanda-Ru/Sl-Bomber

[21:41:47] <manicennui> If someone wrote code like this at work I'd get them fired.
[21:41:55] <drakonis> its the same code lol
[21:41:58] <drakonis> what the fuck
[21:42:13] <manicennui> If they wouldn't fire the person, and the person was on my team, I'd threaten to quit.
[21:45:09] <Geekingfrog> what the actual fuck
[21:45:17] <Geekingfrog> my eyes are bleeding
[21:53:09] <companion_cube> don't you like it when there's 30 levels of if/while
[21:53:32] <manicennui> Why let the while loop get to the top again when you can just repeatedly check the condition in nested if statements?
[22:06:53] <manicennui> "We discovered that low performers were more likely to say that the software they were building—or the set of services they had to interact with—was custom software developed by another company (e.g., an outsourcing partner). Low performers were also more likely to be working on mainframe systems."
[22:06:55] *** Joins: bontaq (~user@ool-45779fe5.dyn.optonline.net)
[22:09:14] <manicennui> The gist of this entire book seems to be that the ability to deploy quickly, including all CI, and the ability to recover from problems quickly, are pretty much the best predictors of performance.
[22:09:39] <manicennui> Makes sense I guess.
[22:15:18] <indigo> I guess I'm just a super low performer because sometimes my changes take two weeks to iterate on
[22:15:39] <manicennui> They aren't talking about development.
[22:15:59] <manicennui> They focus on from the point you are ready to merge into master.
[22:16:40] <manicennui> From that point until the change is available to users.
[22:17:00] <indigo> Ahh
[22:17:01] <manicennui> Including all of CI (build, test, etc.) and release.
[22:18:09] <manicennui> These are the four things they stress over and over:

[22:21:19] <buttsbot> 24 Key Capabilities to Drive Improvement in Software Delivery - IT Revolution
[22:36:23] <gwozniak> I guess our entire team is a low performer
[22:36:53] <gwozniak> What book is this?
[22:36:59] <manicennui> Accelerate
[22:37:15] <dimadima> i used `helm rollback` a few times yesterdasy, it was nice
[22:37:16] <manicennui> It's about the research behind the State of DevOps Report.
[22:37:36] <gwozniak> Ah, okay. We are not a devops thing
[22:37:52] <manicennui> gwozniak: Ignoring the challenges of making it happen, is it even possible for your team to hit these "high performer" numbers?
[22:37:52] <gwozniak> Because there's no way we would deploy on a weekly basis
[22:38:19] <manicennui> Why not?
[22:38:47] <dimadima> if you're not deploying you're not delivering
[22:38:50] <gwozniak> Just testing, even if fully automated, would take about three days
[22:39:08] <dimadima> okay sorry
[22:39:18] <gwozniak> Our short tests take about 5 hours
[22:39:42] <gwozniak> And we aren't testing nearly enough.  We really need to test more on hardware
[22:40:32] <manicennui> I assume a lot of your tests are end-to-end. I think their argument would be that you should focus far more on contract testing with limited end-to-end testing.
[22:40:36] <gwozniak> We could get a build out once a month, I expect.  But we wouldn't deploy that often.  Our customers don't actually seem to like that
[22:40:38] <Brekkjern> Would it not be possible to paralellize the tests?
[22:40:58] <gwozniak> Parallelization is basically impossible
[22:41:07] <dimadima> yeah lots of things shouldn't be deployed often
[22:41:29] <gwozniak> It's doable, but it's an immense amount of work.  If we did it, we would be diverging immensely from upstream GCC
[22:41:30] <dimadima> one of the best things about react? it was v17 for most of 2020 and 2021
[22:41:38] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: I don't mean on one device. Split the test suite into X divisions and have X number of units do the tests.
[22:41:42] <dimadima> i know that's not a compiler
[22:41:51] <gwozniak> If we switch to LLVM, then it would be better
[22:41:56] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: we already do that
[22:42:10] <gwozniak> Otherwise the short tests take 12 housr
[22:42:14] <gwozniak> *hours
[22:42:23] <Brekkjern> The longest singular test takes 5 hours?
[22:42:36] <gwozniak> You can only split it so much
[22:42:45] <gwozniak> DejaGnu is really, really bad
[22:42:46] <Brekkjern> I guess
[22:43:27] <manicennui> Looks like both llvm and gcc have several months without releases, and at most two releases in a month.
[22:43:41] <gwozniak> We have about 250000 tests (the short version)
[22:43:50] <gwozniak> GCC basically doesn't have unit tests
[22:44:00] <gwozniak> Pretty much everything is an integration test
[22:44:26] <gwozniak> It has a self-test mode, which is the closest thing to unit tests, and it barely tests anything
[22:44:52] <manicennui> Rust is about once per month, with no releases some months.
[22:46:20] <companion_cube> every 6 weeks
[22:46:37] <manicennui> This seems fine to me. I don't know that having more frequent compiler releases would be beneficial.
[22:46:44] <manicennui> Regardless of problems with large test suites.
[22:47:12] <manicennui> gwozniak: What do you do if there is a critical bug in a release?
[22:47:25] <gwozniak> Our customers are do far behind there is no point in releasing often
[22:47:58] <gwozniak> manicennui: we will fix it and get it out within a couple of weeks, but that's only happened once
[22:48:22] <gwozniak> s/do far/so far/
[22:48:55] <gwozniak> This is a typical test in GCC: https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/testsuite/g%2B%2B.dg/pubtypes.C
[22:48:56] <buttsbot> gcc/pubtypes.C at master · gcc-mirror/gcc · GitHub
[22:49:32] <manicennui> Is the top part some special testing notation?
[22:49:46] <gwozniak> DejaGnu scans the files for magic comments, invokes the compiler based on the "dg-do" comment and checks based on the other ones
[22:49:55] <manicennui> Ah.
[22:50:07] <gwozniak> Those are all run from .exp files, which bunches them all up and runs them in sequence
[22:51:08] <manicennui> There is something to be said for tests in the same file as the code.
[22:51:21] <manicennui> Rust seems to have this convention.
[22:51:23] <gwozniak> We have broken that up into different buckets, but you have to be careful because there is all kinds of other setup that may be required
[22:52:21] <gwozniak> Here's a .exp file that runs everything in it finds starting from the directory the .exp file is in: https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/testsuite/g%2B%2B.dg/dg.exp
[22:52:22] <buttsbot> gcc/dg.exp at master · gcc-mirror/gcc · GitHub
[22:52:40] <gwozniak> These are G++ tests, btw
[22:52:52] <gwozniak> The 'g++-dg-runtest' command runs the list of tests passed as the arguments
[22:53:10] <gwozniak> So you have to break that down to get things to run in parallel
[22:53:37] <gwozniak> The most parallelization would come from every test having its own .exp file
[22:53:51] <gwozniak> And not all tests are run this way
[22:55:32] <gwozniak> Here's a test that, depending on the simulator you use, can take over 20 minutes to run: https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/testsuite/gcc.dg/memcmp-1.c
[22:55:32] <buttsbot> gcc/memcmp-1.c at master · gcc-mirror/gcc · GitHub
[22:58:16] <gwozniak> Then you have linker tests, which are their own version of hell: https://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=blob;f=ld/testsuite/ld-plugin/lto.exp;h=51e01046a12e4778fcfe0f06d48d17ae97c1c069;hb=HEAD
[22:58:17] <buttsbot> sourceware.org Git - binutils-gdb.git/summary
[23:01:17] <gwozniak> These are the closest you'll get to GCC unit tests: https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/gcc/testsuite/gcc.dg/rtl/x86_64/dfinit.c
[23:01:18] <buttsbot> gcc/dfinit.c at master · gcc-mirror/gcc · GitHub
[23:02:22] <manicennui> Is this... lisp?!
[23:02:34] <gwozniak> It's RTL, which is kind of like Lisp
[23:02:54] <imode> rtl == register transfer logic?
[23:03:24] <gwozniak> Register Transfer Language
[23:03:32] <imode> close.
[23:03:48] <gwozniak> It's like Lisp, but you can't read or write out the full representation.  What's there is a compact version that is not entirely accurate
[23:04:14] <gwozniak> ``People frequently have the idea of using RTL stored as text in a file as an interface between a language front end and the bulk of GCC. This idea is not feasible.''
[23:04:21] <gwozniak> (from the manual)
[23:05:26] <gwozniak> The "__RTL (startwith ("no-opt dfinit"))" in that test tells GCC to skip all kinds of stuff and start at the dfinit stage, so it's not a full integration test
[23:05:44] <gwozniak> But it still tests everything after that stage
[23:06:10] <gwozniak> LLVM has much better testing infrastructure
[23:06:24] <gwozniak> But GCC has *a lot* of tests
[23:07:19] <gwozniak> We can build a compiler in short order.  Testing it takes a long time
[23:08:44] <gwozniak> Our test team takes about 3-5 days to run all their stuff.  I think they need a lot of improvement, though
[23:09:00] <gwozniak> They seem to run a lot of the same stuff we do and they don't automate enough of it
[23:09:35] <gwozniak> We are slowly trying to pull in more testing to us and so we can run it on a regular basis
[23:10:06] <gwozniak> The test team should be verifying things like part support integration, IDE integration and other such things
[23:41:30] <dimadima> thanks gwozniak, really interesting
[23:42:17] <dimadima> remarkably that what.cd haskell story i mentioned yesterday was actually published to torrentfreak
[23:42:32] <dimadima> Our first developer choice was a young developer called rootkit. Immensely intelligent, but perhaps not the greatest people person in the world, rootkit decided that he wanted to write the tracker in haskell instead. We weren’t too excited to have the tracker written in a weird language that no one understood, but he promised that it’d be fast so we let him go at it. We don’t think he ever
[23:42:38] <dimadima> wrote more than a hundred lines of it before he gave up and stepped down.
[23:43:01] <dimadima> https://torrentfreak.com/what-cd-debuts-lightweight-tracker-for-its-5-million-peers-101014/ no idea why that stuck in my mind all the way back in 2010

[23:44:12] <dimadima> RIP what.cd
[23:44:14] <companion_cube> the mistake was to not use rust, obviously
[23:45:09] <gerikson> obvsly
[23:45:16] <gerikson> what.cd was awesome
[23:46:07] <companion_cube> oh god a multithreaded C++ tracker
[23:46:22] *** Quits: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:47:53] <dimadima> that was probably the first time i'd heard of haskell
[23:48:31] <gerikson> I wonder what rootkit is doing now
[23:48:56] <dimadima> yes it was awesome. by the time it was shut down, a popular album had a digitization of probably every single release of it ever made. other albums had usually several if not more
[23:49:34] <gerikson> yeah
[23:49:37] <dimadima> strange that the DB was never backed up and distributed
[23:50:07] <dimadima> it was borderline excessive/compulsive
[23:50:18] <dimadima> heh yeah what is rootkit up to these days
[23:52:56] <dimadima> what if rootkit is in this channel, or #lobsters
[23:53:02] * dimadima looks around
[23:53:48] <companion_cube> what if dimadima is rootkit
[23:54:26] <dimadima> hiding in plain sight
