[05:53:45] <auctus> are the raid5 issues of unrecoverable read error on larger drives also true for raid6, just to a lesser extent? i.e. larger drives means larger risk of rebuild error?
[05:59:32] <sarnold> do you mean the 'raid 5 hole'? or something else?
[05:59:36] <unfinity> ・゜ ​ ゜・。。・゜゜\​_ó< FLAP FLAP​!
[05:59:40] <Selavi> ,bang
[05:59:40] <unfinity> Selavi you shot a duck in 4.453 seconds! You have killed 57 ducks in #datahoarder.
[05:59:45] <NeoThermic> the URE rate of drives isn't really.. correct
[06:00:16] *** Parts: cat[m] (~catmatrix@2001:470:69fc:105::1:cbf8) ()
[06:00:46] <NeoThermic> there's no way in fuck a 12TB drive has a URE of 10^14, else just reading back every bit from the drive would be _impossible_
[06:01:35] <NeoThermic> most people run raid6 over raid5 because drives like to die at the same time, and the most stress a raid has is during a rebuild
[06:02:00] <NeoThermic> with raid6, you can lose two before the _next_ loss is all your data gone, whereas with raid5 it's one less
[06:03:48] <NeoThermic> and really, this is also why backups are a thing
[06:04:10] <NeoThermic> raid gets you out of dodge to a point, backups rescue you from hell
[06:04:34] <auctus> i bought a 4-bay NAS and im trying to decide whether bigger drives means any more risk
[06:04:47] <auctus> i was planning to do raid6
[06:04:59] <auctus> i dont know anything about raid really other than what you can learn on the web in 20 minutes
[06:05:21] <auctus> it seems i have to choose between 4TB and 6TB drives for budget reasons
[06:05:40] <NeoThermic> so
[06:05:55] <NeoThermic> first thing to note you can't really do raid6 with 4 members
[06:06:07] <NeoThermic> I mean, you can, but raid6 requires two drives just for parity
[06:06:15] <NeoThermic> so you'd be left with the sum of two drives of storage space
[06:06:51] <NeoThermic> secondly, be super fucking careful in the under 8TB range that you don't end up with an SMR drive
[06:07:28] <NeoThermic> thirdly, larger drives are more risk, but only because the more data you need to rebuild, the longer it takes, so you have to hope that you don't lose more drives mid-rebuild
[06:11:04] <NeoThermic> anyway, it's 2:40am, I'm off to sleep
[06:11:34] <sarnold> gn8
[06:11:39] <auctus> thanks NeoThermic 
[06:11:41] <auctus> 'night
[06:11:51] * auctus forgot to even consider SMR
[06:13:10] <sarnold> the extent to which you should consider it is probably just to make sure you don't buy them
[06:13:26] <auctus> yeah but dont they hide it nowadays
[06:13:36] <auctus> i havent bought a spinning drive since before SMR was a thing
[06:13:59] <auctus> does this mean with 4 bays, raid6 might as well be raid0?
[06:14:07] <auctus> raid1 whatever the mirror one is
[06:14:08] <auctus> i forgot
[06:14:20] <auctus> raid1
[06:17:46] <auctus> with two drives in raid1, if data on one drive gets corrupt, how do you know which drive is the non-corrupt one? Is that a thing?
[06:18:09] <auctus> should i just go read something about this, and if so what lol, theres a bunch of crapware ad-blogs out there on google, idk what is the good source of information

[06:22:12] <auctus> yeah thats what i thought, assumes one drive is dying / failing to read / whatever, not corrupting shit
[06:22:52] <auctus> so then raid6 still makes sense over raid10 or something for 4 drives if you want to maintain your data
[06:22:55] <auctus> integrity
[06:23:41] <auctus> i see drives with 64MB cache are substantially cheaper than 128MB cache, does cache size make a difference that anyone is going to care about?

[09:45:44] <auctus> ThePendulum: 50 dollars cheaper per drive incl tax
[09:46:36] <ThePendulum> KevinCarbonara: graphic card prices are dropping so make sure to keep an eye on them right now 
[09:46:49] <KevinCarbonara> that's what people keep saying but I haven't seen it
[09:54:43] <ThePendulum> auctus: that seems a bit sus
[09:55:25] <ThePendulum> if I'd order something from Amazon to the Netherlands I'd have to pay VAT, import tax and like $50 shipping
[09:55:44] <auctus> ThePendulum: is the shipping per disk or would it be cheaper for 4 disks
[09:56:06] <auctus> this says "shipping 13.94" but doesnt say if i have to pay that for every disk
[09:56:12] <auctus> i should sign in and try to check out and see
[09:56:36] <ThePendulum> I doubt it's x4 but it might get more expensive by weight

[09:58:33] <auctus> since theyre all sold out here
[10:02:33] <ThePendulum> yeah I've been trying to get one for months, the one that controls my desk lights died 
[10:02:53] <ThePendulum> I hooked up a cheap led controller but it doesn't really do a nice warm white 
[10:03:24] <auctus> what kinda desk lights? 
[10:04:03] <ThePendulum> they're these addressable rgb strips
[10:06:19] <auctus> yeah its fuckin $363 on amazon, shipped and taxed, or $516 here

[10:07:52] <auctus> i did the ws2812s with arduino and pi
[10:08:35] <ThePendulum> it puts up a web interface. I have an stm32 script somewhere but I couldn't really be arsed to solder one together, lol

[21:37:59] <rawktucc> skye0, you should contain it in a virtual machine then, that's so much easier
[21:38:03] <skye0> I plan to only have like prosumer NAS systems at best
[21:38:14] <rawktucc> you could run the VM on a headless machine too, and just connect over a local VNC connection
[21:38:18] <rawktucc> or x forwarding
[21:38:57] <skye0> I think VMs are gonna be a headache for me. I need different computers for different purposes. Like 3 or 4 and that's getting a bit much for me
[21:39:42] <rawktucc> VMs would really suit you better unless you have a need for actual physical hardware access

[21:39:53] <rawktucc> So then yes you need actual physical access
[21:40:07] <rawktucc> but still a VM just for Google is better than an entirely other physical machine. that's what I do
[21:40:15] <skye0> A lighter system as a "middle ground" between those two systems and storage
[21:40:19] <rawktucc> all my Google stuff rarely accessed is in a VM, which I compress and unpack when I need
[21:40:52] <skye0> Or a NAS but I don't want to create two separate scripts for something that will do the same thing on different OSes
[21:41:25] <rawktucc> thats why you install arch on all your systems :)

[21:41:53] <rawktucc> get a steam deck
[21:42:05] <rawktucc> covers portable, powerful, "affordable"
[21:42:09] <skye0> I need mouse and keyboard for shooters
[21:42:15] <rawktucc> you can attach a USB-C dock
[21:42:29] <skye0> And Steam Decks, without some hacking, are generally designed only for gaming
[21:42:39] <rawktucc> i intend to make mine a workstation
[21:42:47] <rawktucc> hacking would really just mean "using linux"
[21:43:38] <rawktucc> anyway i have to get back to work, good luck skye0 . and buy a thinkpad used! :P

[21:44:30] <skye0> I have a gaming laptop, I'm still torn on what to do with it. Powerful enough for some of the games I want to run but also big (only 15" though)
[21:44:48] <skye0> I'm thinking of what to replace that laptop and my Samsung tablet with
[21:47:30] <skye0> Tempted to get another gaming laptop but they're an unsustainable choice. Those that can accept external GPUs are barely better since they're niche and expensive
[21:48:00] <skye0> Gonna have to consider something that isn't marketed for gaming but with about the same sort of power
[21:48:57] <Molly_Lucy> hi skye0 
[21:49:48] <Molly_Lucy> IMHO, gaming laptops are terrible, did you consider to use this instead https://moonlight-stream.org/ https://www.nvidia.com/fr-fr/geforce-now/ ?
[21:50:11] <skye0> Not really, I like to do some light modding and some games aren't on there
[21:50:31] <rawktucc> you can do a non gaming laptop with a thunderbolt eGPU
[21:50:43] <rawktucc> or whatever the non TB standard is
[21:50:45] <Molly_Lucy> ok :) well moonlight with a desktop gaming pc would work, and it's free
[21:51:03] <Molly_Lucy> I use it daily on my macbook, that's wonderful
[21:51:09] <skye0> thinking of a slightly compact laptop with a cheap GPU in it
[21:51:19] <rawktucc> thinkpad x260 :)
[21:51:55] <skye0> I'll have to think about it more seriously on the next payday and leave or two
[21:53:03] <skye0> Need something that I can easily and quickly just switch on for emails and video calls, and carry around too, but also have enough power for me to play some games on the go
[21:54:03] <skye0> And I'll need to work on my RPI "NAS". Not a proper one because it'll interface with a NAS in the future if needed, but it'll replace the dual boot crap at times that I've used for my desktop

[23:58:18] <rawktucc> so i was looking at scaleway's mac offerings
[23:58:20] <rawktucc> "As required by Apple License, you must keep this Instance for at least 24 hours. You will be able to delete it only after 24 hours."
[23:58:30] <rawktucc> so despite being able to order one for 1 hr, you have to keep it for 24?
[23:59:49] <cirdan> huh?
