[00:23:49] <cherim> "The line with a device" is a classical setting, and https://i.ibb.co/5n7qLS7/DSCN1946.jpg is quite a decent problem. You can do the following: 1) draw a line through two known points, 2) mark point of intersection of a line with previously drawn lines, or the initially given circle; 3) mark an arbitrary point on/off a line, on/off a circle or at an unspecified position. Just the usual Greek constructions, but no compass used.

[03:10:14] <zacts> I'm trying to understand dedkind cuts just a bit
[03:10:19] <zacts> dedekind
[03:12:27] <zacts> Definition: A *cut* in Q is a pair of subsets A,B of Q such that: A U B = Q, A != {}, B != {}, A intersect B = {}. If a element A and b element B then a < b. A contains no largest element.

[03:13:18] <zacts> A is the left-hand part of the cut and B is the right-hand part. We denote the cut as x = A|B.
[03:13:23] <zacts> so my question..
[03:13:55] <zacts> is x a single number?

[03:16:50] <zacts> x can't be a set right? it must be a number.
[03:17:20] <Jynx> what does A|B mean
[03:17:58] <zacts> Jynx: A|B is defined to mean "We denote the cut as x = A|B."
[03:18:08] <zacts> and that's based on the above definition.
[03:18:36] <zacts> or are you asking me as a hint?
[03:18:39] <Jynx> ah I see
[03:19:13] <Jynx> based on ur definitions, x must be the pair of subsets A,B of Q
[03:19:52] <cherim> It's not clear why you even ask this question. Yes, x [will be] a real number. But you are reading a text, so why stop here and ask? There is a ton of work from this definition onwards
[03:20:44] <zacts> cherim: are you saying I should just keep going with the text before asking?
[03:21:40] <cherim> Yes, the text has its own logic. And it's impossible to stop at this point, get "x is a real number", and skip the proofs of correctness, arithmetic properties etc.
[03:22:21] <zacts> Ok, thanks.
[03:22:38] <Jynx> If sup(A) is undefined, does it follow that A is open and B is closed, hence for B we have inf(B) = min(B)?
[03:23:33] <cherim> This is all in Q. B may have no min.

[13:23:04] <isekaijin> If so, then you need to use the fact that the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
[13:23:13] <kill-animals> For Exercises 1-4, find the numeric value of the indicated angle(s) for the triangle △ ABC .
[13:23:25] <greenbagels> and the question then becomes "solve for beta, and plug it into the formulae for angles A, B, C"

[14:06:55] <CuriousErnestBro> the x^2 isn't supposed to be there, it should be inside the integral
[14:07:12] <CuriousErnestBro> Yes, E(1/X) = int 1/x f(x) dx
[14:07:15] <cherim> Nothing is outside the integral here
[14:07:16] <CuriousErnestBro> what you're saying is different
[14:07:42] <CuriousErnestBro> you're saying E(1/X) = int f(x) dx/x
[14:08:13] <cherim> int f(x) dx/x = int 1/x f(x) dx
[14:08:30] <cherim> It's integration variable, it can't be outside
[14:08:48] <CuriousErnestBro> okay, so you can just move them around like that?

[14:09:46] <CuriousErnestBro> nope never saw them

[14:10:34] <cherim> Ok, now does this integral converge?
[14:10:49] *** Joins: Arsen (~arsen@managarm/dev/Arsen)
[14:11:38] <cherim> For fixed s, it's  const * int_{-inf}^inf 1/x^2 exp(-Ax^2)dx
[14:11:57] <cherim> It behaves like 1/x^2 near x=0, won't ever come close to convergence
[14:12:23] <CuriousErnestBro> why are we looking at convergence here?
[14:12:39] <cherim> Because the result of this is what you want to integrate over s

[14:15:20] <CuriousErnestBro> is this a convergence of the integral?
[14:15:35] <cherim> "\int_0^1 E[B_s^{-2}] ds" that you ask about is the same as "int_0^1 (undefined) ds", or "int_0^1 (plain infinity) ds"
[14:15:48] <CuriousErnestBro> Yes, that part is clear
[14:15:56] <cherim> The convergence of the integral over s is not even posed
[14:16:22] <CuriousErnestBro> I meant the convergence of the integral over x
[14:16:23] <CuriousErnestBro> the expectation part
[14:16:24] <CuriousErnestBro> is "convergence of integrals" a real math term?
[14:16:36] <cherim> Certainly

[14:23:58] <kill-animals> I don't know what geometric means
[14:24:51] <cherim> Means it's a property of some configuration of lines, but not of units of length etc.

[17:39:45] <Nickssen> I am asked if the function f(z) = { z^5  /   ||z||^4  for all z =! ,  = 0 for z =0 }  has a derivative at 0, and if it satisfies Cauchy-riemann
[17:40:53] <Nickssen> I put z in polar form and reduced the quotient to re^(i5 theta), and then put it in this form  r(cos(5theta) + isin(5theta))  which would be u(r,theta) + iv(r,theta)
[17:41:09] <Nickssen> it doesn't satisfy polar cauchy riemann eqs., except when the radius is 0
[17:41:39] <Nickssen> could I argument that because it doesnt satisfy cauchy riemann in a neighbourhood of 0, then it's not differentiable at 0?

[17:44:00] <Z-module> this happens at all points for  f(z) = Re(z)    for example
[17:44:33] <rubiksdream> would this be correct? if E_1,E_2 are open+connected subsets of C U {infinity}, and I have a homeomorphism f : E_1->E_2, then given an exhausting sequence of compact subsets C_k for E_1 (i.e. C_k are compact subsets of E_1 s.t. any compact subset of E_1 is contained in some C_k, and are increasing), f(C_k) is a exhausting sequence of compact subsets for E_2
[17:45:01] <rubiksdream> then if this is true, shouldn't I also get that d(C_k, boundary(E_1)) -> 0, and d(f(C_k), boundary (E_2)) -> 0?
[17:45:02] <Z-module> by the way, it's much more common in complex analysis to denote the length of z by |z|, rather than ||z||, but maybe your source is different.
[17:45:13] <Z-module> (they mean the same thing)
[17:45:40] <Nickssen> I'll give it a go with the limit
[17:45:45] <Nickssen> see how it turns out hehe
[17:45:49] <Nickssen> and  yeah, the book has

[17:50:47] <Nickssen> also, when they ask if a function f is harmonic, they  mean if u(x,y) and v(x,y) are harmonic, right?
[17:50:52] <Nickssen> silly question
[17:51:17] <Z-module> hmm, presumably; normally "harmonic" functions are in the context of real-valued things
[17:51:56] <Z-module> rubiksdream: isn't your question really just about one set E_1 and any single exhausting sequence of compact subsets?
[17:52:08] <Z-module> Not sure what the homeomorphism to E_2 has to do with anything
[17:52:50] <Nickssen> thanks Z!!
[17:52:56] <rubiksdream> Z-module right, i guess i wanted to know if a sequence of compact subsets is exhausting iff its distance to the boundary tends to 0

[17:55:14] <Z-module> rubiksdream: distance -> 0 does not imply exhausting. Just imagine E_1 being an open disk, C_1 is some narrow closed annulus co-centered inside E_1, and now grow C_1's outer boundary a little bit more but leave the inner boundary alone, to get C_2, etc like that
[17:55:37] <rubiksdream> oh yes, you're right
[17:55:55] <rubiksdream> so exhausting is strictly stronger than distance -> 0
[17:56:20] <rubiksdream> then the question i wanted to ask becomes, does exhausting -> distance to boundary goes to zero
[17:56:25] <Z-module> I believe so

[18:19:44] <Z-module> well, the differential quotient that I wrote is simply  h^4/|h^4|   and you can make the limit of that (as h -> 0) be any point you want on the unit circle, or have no limit.

[21:47:39] <NEYi_> Hey guys, how do I use Windows calculator to calculate 8 bit unsigned character overflow, if a number is added to it that's many times larger than 255? Say, unsigned char already has number 255 in it... And I add 1000. Just +1 will make it go back to 0... And then there's also 999 to add... With a few more overflows. :)

[21:47:58] <NEYi_> My guess is that modulo function should be used.
[21:48:11] <brownorange> (((a or not b) nor c) implies c)   has truth density 7/8 or 87.5%  whereas not (((a or not b) nor c) implies c) has 1/8 or 12.5% truth density.  neither are a tautology so l.e.m (a or not a) does not hold forall a

[21:52:23] <brownorange> if the 19th century result is proof is not truth because proving a or not a isn't possible for every wff, then we should also see that  every constructible wff never obeyed l.e.m in the first place.

[23:07:03] <somiaj> I also think truth density is not a useful thing to think about, depending on what statements you are working with you may not have a uniform spread of true and false statements
[23:08:02] <dila> brownorange: you're counting the number of times a boolean function evaluates to true?
[23:08:06] <brownorange> somiaj truth density of 0%, i'm taking to mean it's an absurdity (all rows false). truth density of 100% i'm taking to mean it is a tautology (all rows true)
[23:08:19] <somiaj> in general I prefer to think of statements as things that are either true or they are false. This is useful for lots of theories.
[23:08:25] <W> brownorange, so by "truth density" you mean to count the number of possible truth values for the variables and how many of them the whole expression is true? In that case, the "truth density" of "<expression1> or <expression2>" depends on how much they overlap in truth value, and negation means there is no overlap
[23:09:23] <brownorange> @dila number of trues over the number of truth rows = truth density. this is what wolfram's truth density is from what i can tell

[23:11:04] <W> brownorange, nothing is being bread
[23:11:26] <W> you can look at the law of excluded middle as a /definition/ of negation, if you like

[23:12:04] <W> negation means that the trues in the truth table values are exactly the entries in the truth table that were not true before
[23:12:21] <W> brownorange, individually they have truth tables
[23:12:40] <brownorange> @W which report neither has having 0% or 100% densities
[23:12:40] <dila> brownorange: i think that if the "truth density" is 50% then the function is called a Balanced boolean function
[23:12:44] <W> and negation means that whatever the truth table is, one has the exact opposite truth table than the other
[23:12:53] <somiaj> a truth table and its truth density is different than the actual truth of false of a statement for any given a,b,c,d,e.
[23:12:57] <W> truth density of a is one minus the truth density of !a

[23:13:15] <dila> W: this is a consequence of the behaviour of the truth table for negation

[23:21:21] <brownorange> @W the answer is no. just as you would never declare a broken marble to be a true marble in the first place,
[23:21:22] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: a linear order means any two elements are comparable, (partial orders you may not require that everythig is comparable)
[23:21:33] <W> brownorange, the answer is "it depends"
[23:21:40] <W> mathematics depends on rigor
[23:21:40] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: for instance subseteq is a partial order, but you can't compare {1,2} and {1,3,5}

[23:26:23] <cuppajoeman> yes that makes sense
[23:26:31] <brownorange> @W to answer your question about why i think L.E.M uses inclusive-or, object exists or object does not exist is fine, but if an object is true or false, that's another issue. you can prove with truth tables and syntax that (a or not a) , inclusive or, is a tautology!
[23:26:53] <W> brownorange, existence of objects is not relevant here
[23:26:59] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: so now that we have a partial order, lets go to linear order. An order is linear if everything is comparable, that means for all a,b in your set either a<=b or b<=a

[23:28:24] <dila> robototo60: i expect wolfram alpha knows that one in a table. or do you mean how is it derived?
[23:28:30] <brownorange> (a xor not a) makes more sense than (a or not a), because it's clear that something is exclusive to its own negation
[23:28:42] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: basically a realation is any subset of AxA, if the relation is transitive, reflexive, and anti-symetric, then it is a partial order
[23:28:56] <W> brownorange, the question was why you think one "models" the other, where have you heard that, who told you, how did you deduce it, what does "model" mean in that deduction?
[23:29:03] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: there is nothing in any of those statements to state that for all a,b in A, that (a,b) in R or (b,a) in R -- nothing requires that so far
[23:29:22] <cuppajoeman> Ok, and so the element ({1, 2}, {1, 3, 5}) is not in R
[23:29:33] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: so it is more that the definition of partial order doesn't force all things to be comparable, which allows for the option things are not comparable (such as my subset example)
[23:29:33] <W> brownorange, well, what do you think of (a and not a)
[23:29:34] <cuppajoeman> And neither is ({1, 3, 5}, {1, 2})
[23:29:40] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: correct
[23:29:54] <cuppajoeman> Ok I see now
[23:30:00] <robototo60> @dila yes, i am not sure what the process is to give the result x(x^n - 1)/(n(x-1))
[23:30:23] <cuppajoeman> Ok linear order
[23:30:32] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: then linear now forces things to be comparable, for all a,b in A, either (a,b) in R or (b,a) in R, but we just prefer to write it as a<=b instead of (a,b) in R
[23:30:38] <brownorange> @W if you look at the truth table for each binary operator you'll notice a pattern. it is asking a question on inputs and returning an answer that says yes/no that the two inputs satisfy the operation.
[23:30:49] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: so a partial order can be a tree (Think of subsets)
[23:31:34] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/afteracademy-server-uploads/print-all-subsets-of-a-given-set-recursion-tree-9bbcd4be963c54c8.jpg see how the subset partial order creates a tree of what is subset of other things?
[23:31:35] <cuppajoeman> subsets?
[23:31:39] <W> brownorange, yes, for each "interpretation" of the operation (as a formula) as you clarified earlier.
[23:31:40] <dila> robototo60: it is my undertsanding that there is no systematic way to arrive at that kind of closed form expression from the summation expression. i could be wrong. what i am sure about is that give the original input expression and the closed form expression, you can prove that they are equal (maybe by induction)
[23:31:43] <brownorange> @W input1=true,input2=true,   now take input1 and input2, this would return affirmative that input1 and input2  is a correct use of and
[23:32:19] <W> brownorange, indeed, and "input1 and input2" itself isn't sufficient to deduce its truth value
[23:32:28] <cuppajoeman> So the parent node is a subset of all it's children
[23:32:31] <dila> robototo60: the ability to check the solution at least gives you the opportunity to make a guess at the solution, and there may be some structured guessing that could be called a systematic process.
[23:32:36] <Z-module> cuppajoeman: you can even have a poset (partially ordered set) where *no* two distinct things are comparable.
[23:32:38] <brownorange> @W propositional l.e.m appears to suggest you can do something very different. you can declare that one or the other is true by their affect on each other.
[23:32:40] <W> because there is nothing else relating the two independent inputs
[23:33:00] <cuppajoeman> So then the poset is empty?
[23:33:07] <Z-module> no, it has the elements
[23:33:09] <cuppajoeman> except maybe (a,a)
[23:33:20] <W> if you say "input1 and input1" we can now deduce that the truth value of this is just "input1" because the two inputs to the operator are related
[23:33:22] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: So now a linear order (Since everything is comparable) you must be able to put all of your objects in a line, such that things to the left are always smaller than things to the right.
[23:33:48] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: think of the integers, you can order them in a line with standard <=, or the real number line, it orders everything so points on the left are always <= points on the right
[23:34:00] <cuppajoeman> Is that coming from transitivity?
[23:34:03] <brownorange> @W but is {a, !a}  really related?
[23:34:11] *** Joins: usr25 (~usr25@user/usr25)
[23:34:13] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: so though partial orders can have lots of variety, linear order takes this away
[23:34:20] <cuppajoeman> Ok
[23:34:22] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: a combiation of transitivity and everything must be comprable
[23:34:24] <W> brownorange, yes, !a is wholly determined by a
[23:34:29] <cuppajoeman> I see
[23:34:44] <dila> robototo60: what do you think about what i said?
[23:34:44] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: ready for what 'dense' means?
[23:34:45] <Z-module> well, visualizing things as a line is rather informal. For example, the ordinal aleph_1 is certainly a linear ordering, but there is no order-preserving injection of it into (R, <).
[23:34:49] <brownorange> @W I disagree.   !a could be any that is not a.
[23:34:59] <cuppajoeman> Yes

[23:35:25] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: dense means that for any a < b (this means a<=b and a!=b), there exists c such that a < c < b
[23:35:35] <robototo60> thank you @dila!
[23:35:38] <W> brownorange, like I said, mathematics is a game, we make up our own rules. This is part of the rules that almost everyone else play by; you're free to make up your own rules (or subscribe to some minority alternative)
[23:35:44] <cuppajoeman> So Q is dense because you can take (b-a)/2
[23:35:46] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: so the integers are not dense, because there is no integer between 3 and 4.
[23:35:54] <cuppajoeman> Yeah
[23:35:59] <W> brownorange, normally we don't say we "disagree" though, because it's just a choice, not a belief
[23:36:03] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: but here it is about the order (not the objects, you can actually put lots of different orders on Q)
[23:36:25] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: but yes, Q with the standard order is dense
[23:36:35] <cuppajoeman> Oh ok, so the standard order is the less than or equal to relation
[23:36:40] <Z-module> cuppajoeman: if you are ever stuck at a bus or train stop with a long boring wait, try to think of an order-preserving bijection Q -> Q\{0}
[23:36:47] <brownorange> @W suppose you had {x,y,z,w} that are true, and {e,f,g,h} that are false.    '!x' would imply  all of {e,f,g,h}, therefore 'x' it is not necessarily related to 'x'
[23:37:00] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: and last no end points, means for all a there exists b and c such that b < a < c (there is no minimial or maximial element in this order)
[23:37:15] <W> brownorange, yes it is
[23:37:37] <W> brownorange, that's why we use letters instead of single dots
[23:37:38] <brownorange> @W this how prop-calc does business. when two things do not have the same truth, they are as separate as can be. thus the relation of 'x' to '!x' isn't very strong.  so we can't be seduced by the power of it

[23:38:30] <W> we could say {.,.,.,.} is true and {.,.,.,.} is false and that !. implies {.,.,.,.}, but we now have no game
[23:38:37] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: the set of objects you have ordered is countable (bijection between it and N) such as Q
[23:38:42] <W> brownorange, no it is not, you are wrong about this
[23:38:47] <W> brownorange, who told you this?
[23:38:49] <cuppajoeman> Z-module: Does order preserving mean that if (a, b) in R then ( f(a), f(b) ) in R?
[23:38:50] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: so Q is such a thing that meets your criteria
[23:39:01] <brownorange> @W my observations of using the logic
[23:39:30] <Z-module> cuppajoeman: yes, and here, R is just the usual < order on Q
[23:39:38] <cuppajoeman> Thank you
[23:39:43] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: but there are tons of other things that could be similar, countable number of objects, which are ordered in a linear fashion, such that this order is is both dense and has no end points
[23:40:05] <W> (a or b) depends on b, if you make a table of the two with all possible combinations of true and false as rows, some of the rows are invalid interpretations of the formula, logic says that it's not a valid truth table, it contains a contradiction
[23:40:17] *** Quits: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:40:23] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: the interesting thing is there are plenty of orders that meet your definition, (countable, linear, dense, no-dendpoints) that are not isomorphic to Q as an order.
[23:40:51] *** Quits: biberao (~m@user/biberao) (Quit: WeeChat 2.3)
[23:41:01] <brownorange> @W fair point. but if b is substituted with the negation of 'a', we can say more interestingly 'a' is separate from '!a' and vice versa
[23:41:22] <somiaj> actually wait, I think I might need to be careful there, I think you can find things no isomorphic to Q, but my example I think is isomorphic to Q
[23:41:29] <W> brownorange, when you write a truth table for "a or b", you have four rows, right? But there are three boolean choices for each row, why not eight rows?
[23:41:47] <Z-module> somiaj: I ultimately came around to the opinion that the standard theorem "Every countably infinite dense linear ordering without endpoints is order-isomorphic to Q" isn't as complete as it should be. I much prefer:  "Every countably infinite dense linear ordering is order-isomorphic to a unique thing in the list:  Q cap (0,1),  Q cap [0,1),  Q cap (0,1],  Q cap [0,1] "
[23:42:08] <dila> W: you're saying you would include the result/output of the boolean function in the table too?
[23:42:10] <Z-module> (that is: Q, or Q with a left endpoint adjoined, or Q with a right endpoint adjoined, or Q with both)
[23:42:15] <brownorange> @W not sure what you mean by 3 choices. what are the 3 choices?
[23:42:32] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so countable and dense is a property about the set your relation is defined upon and linear order is a property about the relation itself?
[23:42:34] <W> dila, I am making a rhetorical and/or pedagogic argument
[23:42:44] <W> brownorange, the three columns
[23:42:52] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: dense is actually a property of the relation/order
[23:43:02] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: but countable is a property of the set
[23:43:07] <Z-module> "countable" is purely about the set itself; "dense" is about the specific linear ordering on it

[23:43:19] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: you can't have dense with out the order, recall dense means that for all a<b, there exists c such that a<c<b
[23:43:21] <Z-module> for example, the reals with usual < is a dense uncountable linearly ordered set
[23:43:24] <cuppajoeman> "dense means that for any a < b (this means a<=b and a!=b), there exists c such that a < c < b" so here < is a relation
[23:43:28] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: so the order is required for that.

[23:43:48] <cuppajoeman> Ok I think I understand
[23:44:04] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: yes, and we just prefer to write a<b and a<=b instead of (a,b) and a!=b in R, or (a,b) in R
[23:44:06] <cuppajoeman> So if (a, b) in R, then there is a c st (a, c) in R and (c, b) in R

[23:44:23] <brownorange> input1,input2,output  (3 rows)
[23:44:24] <somiaj> cuppajoeman: you need to add a!=b and c!=a and c!=b in there, but yes
[23:44:31] <cuppajoeman> Ok I see
[23:45:00] <brownorange> @W 3 colums, 3rows. whatever
[23:45:08] <W> brownorange, three /columns/ - and, normally, four /rows/ (not counting any headers you might like). But you could write down eight rows if you liked, yes? Why don't we?
[23:45:16] <dila> brownorange: 3 columns, 8 rows
[23:45:43] <brownorange> @W why would you say 8?
[23:46:08] <dila> the number of rows is 2^n for n columns
[23:46:17] <W> because 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 are eight combinations of 0 or 1 for false or true
[23:47:08] <somiaj> Z-module: okay, yea as I started to think more about it, I realized my trick I was trying to do was for well-orders (hence not dense).
[23:47:38] <somiaj> Z-module: so I guess I won't be able to create an linear, dense, order without enpdoints that is not isomorphic to Q
[23:48:16] <brownorange> @W that would be counting cells
[23:48:17] <Z-module> somiaj: trick for what?
[23:48:49] <brownorange> @W i can't really figure out what table you're thinking of
[23:48:54] <somiaj> move a infinte subset of the order to just bigger than everyting by default
[23:49:15] <somiaj> so Z with usual order, or make all evens > odds, but user order otherwise
[23:49:37] <somiaj> I was trying to do that with Q thinking I would get something different, but that dense part makes it so it didn't work out
[23:50:54] <Z-module> somiaj, right, that theorem is old and fairly easy.

[23:56:27] <brownorange> @W for random formulas, if you have n vars: then you need n+1 columns, and you need 2^n rows, each row would be n+1 cells wide.
[23:57:47] <brownorange> for defining operators you need 3 columns, 4 rows, with each row being 3-cells wide.
