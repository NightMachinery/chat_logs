[04:23:48] <gpanders> I doubt it’s LSP or pyright. It’s most likely the Python ftplugin file that ships with both Vim and Neovim. Create a file `after/ftplugin/python.vim` under your nvim config directory and add `setlocal shiftwidth=2` to that file 
[04:24:03] <gpanders> You can also use a `.lua` file if you prefer
[04:24:51] *** Joins: hippoid (~hippoid@c-98-220-13-8.hsd1.il.comcast.net)

[11:49:59] <p00f>  * neat!
[11:52:29] <p00f> why does replacing `echo msg` with `lua vim.notify(msg)` here https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch/blob/master/autoload/dispatch.vim#L408 not work?
[11:54:47] <p00f> (not work = no notification)
[11:54:59] <p00f> no error either
[11:57:54] <dre> p00f, because msg is a vimscript variable? 
[11:58:07] <dre> i'm not sure if that's an actual thing
[11:58:32] <dre> but if i set something in vimscript i wouldn't immediately expect it to be available on the lua machine at the time 
[11:59:41] <p00f> hmmm
[12:02:44] <p00f> dre: thanks, changing that to `call v:lua.vim.notify(msg)` worked
[12:04:38] <dre> :D 
[12:07:45] <bluemonksr[m]> I am trying to understand the stuff Lsps Index. for cpp for example, if i have a compile_commands.json in my root of proect, clangd registers all the functions within so that I can jump to the file (outside root-dir) that has the definition of a function under cursor. But that file is not indexed
[12:08:21] <bluemonksr[m]> but if i use the regular tagfunc to jump to the same definition, the tempfile created for the tagfunc is indexed
[12:08:38] <bluemonksr[m]> s/stuff/files/, s/Index/Indexes/
[12:10:16] <bluemonksr[m]> So i usually endup using native tagfunc than lsp definition so that i can further navigate, rather than with lsp

[19:21:13] <kylo252[m]> how did I break the CI when I haven't changed any core files.. smh 
[19:21:56] <swimmer> hmmm is there anything special to get floats working in vim.diagnostic.config?
[19:22:30] <swimmer> I've disabled virtual_text and defined some config options for float but nothing is shown ...
[19:22:53] <mjlbach[m]> wdym get floats working
[19:23:01] <mjlbach[m]> floats should work without configuration
[19:24:47] <swimmer> well I mean I'd expect to see appearing a floating window in a line with an error. 
[19:25:06] <swimmer> let me try without configuration ...

[19:30:55] <kylo252[m]> are you supposed to set the `scope` in the config? that looks wrong
[19:31:11] *** Joins: xsteadfastx (~marv@94.31.100.46)
[19:31:31] <mjlbach[m]> lets figure out what the unexpected behavior is first and then we can go through the configuration options :) 
[19:32:59] <swimmer> That's very helpful! Seriously. I'd wish I'd know how to phrase better what behaviour I'd expect ...
[19:33:04] <kylo252[m]> the problem is that there's no strict validation, since it's hard to do anyway
[19:33:04] <kylo252[m]> a quick glance at the help-tags at least shows that `scope` is specifically for `open_float` and not `vim.diagnostic.config`

[19:33:32] <swimmer> kylo252[m]: I'll chip it.
[19:34:05] <mjlbach[m]> The way the floats work, is you call a function (vim.diagnostic.goto_next) which:
[19:34:05] <mjlbach[m]> 1. moves the cursor to the diagnostic
[19:34:05] <mjlbach[m]> 2. creates a floating window with the content of the diagnostic at that position
[19:34:16] <mjlbach[m]> you also can trigger a floating window that contains the diagnostics for the entire line
[19:35:46] <swimmer> mjlbach[m]: I expected appearing a floating window as soon as I'm entering a line with diagnostics. Just as with virtual_text. I didn't realize that I first have to call `vim.diagnostic.goto_next()`

[19:35:54] <kylo252[m]> swimmer: you can try my configuration if you'd like, but you can remove the format part since I've noticed that they got changed at some point and I'm not sure mine is correct
[19:35:54] <kylo252[m]> https://github.com/kylo252/dotfiles/blob/bba734a023b785ebc29a8db31bc41363f8aa87b3/.config/nvim/lua/lsp/handlers.lua#L22-L39
[19:36:38] <kylo252[m]> well, you need an autocmd then, but I can see why it would be confusing
[19:37:24] <mjlbach[m]> swimmer: You can add an autocmd, there's an example on the lspconfig wiki under ui customization
[19:37:27] <swimmer> And there my stupidity starts: I've configured `goto_next` and `goto_prev` with `float = false` as I was using virtual_text :/
[19:37:52] <mjlbach[m]> vim.o.updatetime = 250
[19:37:53] <mjlbach[m]> vim.cmd [[autocmd CursorHold,CursorHoldI * lua vim.lsp.diagnostic.show_line_diagnostics({focusable=false})]]
[19:37:58] <mjlbach[m]> that's with the 0.5.1 API
[19:38:02] <swimmer> I just today got curious how the floating diagnostics work ...
[19:38:09] <mjlbach[m]> which should still work
[19:38:17] <mjlbach[m]> updatetime can be customized to taste
[19:38:18] <swimmer> now I know ;)

[19:39:04] <mjlbach[m]> it works fine

[19:40:35] <mjlbach[m]> Ok, well that's another bug that likely doesn't affect swimmer and is general to neovim
[19:41:19] <kylo252[m]> I did hit that bug when I had the diagnostics on CursorHold
[19:44:39] <kylo252[m]> hopefully it's been fixed now, it was triggering immediately whenever you open a buffer or something like
[19:44:39] <kylo252[m]> I've been using a trigger for while now and I've been pretty happy about it since!

[20:54:16] <kylo252[m]> posting again here for visibility/discussion:
[20:54:16] <kylo252[m]> > FWIW, I wanted to debug something in `vim.diagnostic`, for example: 
[20:54:16] <kylo252[m]> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/2bd8f2fb5ee958e210efa27286a8fe0c27b8dbbc/runtime/lua/vim/diagnostic.lua#L677-L686
[20:54:16] <kylo252[m]> I noticed that there are 0 log calls in that file, which kinda makes sense since all the "LSP" logging is done with `vim.lsp.log`, whereas this interface should be independent of `vim.lsp`. Does that mean we need a new `diagnostic.log`? Probably not. So I'm actually in favor of unifying the logfile, as long as each message has its own unique identifier/prefix.
[20:55:18] <mjlbach[m]> Sure lsp.log probably should not exist
[20:55:35] <mjlbach[m]> I also think there’s already too much logging in the lsp subsystem
[20:55:52] <mjlbach[m]> Imo the only thing that should be optionally logged is the rpc messages
[20:56:14] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: but can we actually make the switch already? I got the impression that the main logger needs to be refactored first. maybe it's locking the file
[20:56:45] <mjlbach[m]> I don’t see this being resolved any time soon
[20:56:57] <kylo252[m]> exactly :\
[20:57:17] <kylo252[m]> and `vim.diagnostic` needs a logger ASAP
[20:58:32] <kylo252[m]> I just remembered why I wanted to debug it: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/16349
[20:58:50] <mjlbach[m]> It doesn’t need a logger because the error messages were obvious
[20:59:18] <kylo252[m]> do you mean this issue, or in general? 
[20:59:42] <mjlbach[m]> In general I see no need for vim.diagnostic to need a logging subsystem
[21:01:08] <kylo252[m]> it could be useful for multiple things, like sanitizing the input, or measuring cache-hits, etc.
[21:01:18] <mjlbach[m]> What
[21:01:33] <kylo252[m]> for detecting that the messages are sanitized*
[21:02:42] <kylo252[m]> because I was thinking that for #16349, this wouldn't be allowed to happen if the message was set through LSP, it would not be allowed to be with an invalid iine-nr 
[21:12:08] <mjlbach[m]> I think you are confusing validation and logging

[21:19:09] <kylo252[m]> well if you consider that you can't validate every single corner-case, then logging will help you by showing that your theoretical workflow isn't exactly right. I'm not sure how relevant it is for `vim.diagnostic` but it's probably a good idea either way to have it for trace logging.
[21:19:09] <kylo252[m]> I could be completely off-the-mark here as well :)

[21:23:22] <p00f> when was vim.notify added?
[21:23:55] <p00f> nvim version i mean
[21:24:41] <clason[m]> 0.5.0 
[21:24:53] <p00f> thanks
[21:24:54] <clason[m]> as `git log --grep "vim.notify"` will readily tell you

[21:27:34] <kylo252[m]> there's probably some combination that let's you check which was the first-tag (0.5?) that includes this, but my git-fu isn't that strong.. 
[21:28:08] <mjlbach[m]> Vim.notify is not logging…
[21:28:22] <mjlbach[m]> It’s showing a message to the user
[21:28:43] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: you missed a message in between 😄
[21:29:05] <clason[m]> (the question was not related to logging -- I hope)
