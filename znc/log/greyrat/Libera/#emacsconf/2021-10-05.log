[09:10:40] <brandelune> Are there news about the various proposals? Whether they are accepted or not?
[09:13:26] <alphapapa[m]> brandelune: bandali said Sunday around noon, "not yet :) but we'll be following up with speakers in the coming days, and hopefully publish a tentative schedule not long after"
[09:14:37] <brandelune> Ok. Sorry for rushing you. When I sent my proposal I thought I'd get an acknowledgement by mail, since there was no reaction I was wondering.
[09:15:39] <alphapapa[m]> You're not rushing me, I'm not involved :)

[10:57:41] <zaeph> brandelune: Hi.  You should have got an automatic response acknowledging that we've received your proposal.  We'll be updating shortly, probably before Thursday.
[10:58:43] <brandelune> I'm checking and I'm not sure I got anything.
[11:29:12] <zaeph> For transparency's sake, I've addressed things in private with brandelune.

[16:31:09] <bandali> brandelune, you definitely should've received an automated email confirming your submission :/
[16:31:33] <bandali> i had tested that it worked in the very beginning of the CFP process
[16:32:17] <brandelune> I'm not seeing it, but it doesn't mean you've not sent it :-)
[16:32:45] <bandali> ok :)
