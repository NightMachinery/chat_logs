[07:36:11] <bugweiser> nvuafo, when you are far away from home you can take your phone out of your lead-lined envelope, turn it on, take a picture or write down the sms on paper. Then turn off phone, put back in lead envelope, travel back home. Be sure you have microwaved your clothes and don't bring any nfc id cards with you while traveling. Wear hat and always look humbly to the ground.
[07:36:38] <bugweiser> best is to take your biclecle, and cycle a couple of hours through a forrest, there are not that many camera's there.
[07:37:13] <bugweiser> at home you then use OCR software to digitize the image of the sms, or type it into your computer.
[07:37:18] <bugweiser> simple and easy :)
[07:39:52] <bugweiser> a couple of years ago there were some blackberries that were reasonably safe, but no more, couse some folk started to get 'missing' and went on a 'holliday'.

[07:54:08] <bugweiser> alternative methods that don't involve taking a picture or manual writing/typing often utilize some sort of data-link that you can controll & verify & trust.
[07:56:30] <bugweiser> good candidate is audio. Some ultrasonic networking javascript libraries float around the net to let air-gapped computers communicate. Tiny speakers are your friend here because they obay the laws of physics regarding high-frequencies (there is a reason tweaters cones are small and bass cones are big in diameter). Most microphones and opamps have been more than adequate over the past 20 years on most consumer hardware.
[07:58:27] <bugweiser> A variation is utilizing infrared (lowest frequency you can find, should be maxing out on 40.000 hz), and you add in a rectifier to achieve this speed by flipping the negative audio-signal part to positive. (20khz + 20khz = 40khz).

[08:00:26] <nvuafo> I guess using a phone is out of the picture. But how then would you maintain some form of mobile communication? Suppose you wish to coordinate a meetup with a friend, but your friend is lost. Connect your laptop onto a wifi hotspot to send a message where you're at?
[08:00:34] <nvuafo> how do you guys deal without using a phone?
[08:01:14] <isf> a life with phone

[08:59:09] <rbraun> bugweiser: yes, why specifically 2 bits
[08:59:39] <bugweiser> if you have a good hash with string avalanche properties on ascii weights, then a simple support-app can support the user in crafting messages which hash to these 2 bits.
[09:00:20] <bugweiser> when I 'invented' it, the design-goal was proof of life with plausible deniability. The method is actually proven for that case.
[09:00:30] <bugweiser> but you can abuse it... loosing some properties.
[09:00:34] <rbraun> huh
[09:00:35] <bugweiser> 1 bit is to slow

[22:40:20] <mcss> what's this website?
[22:40:36] <mcss> got it as a result of a search engine
[22:41:07] <mcss> it uses the gnu logo and text... is it official?
[22:41:24] <mcss> I know the official site is gnu.org
[22:42:44] <gustaf> looks like a technical university in Lisbon
[22:44:03] <mcss> so it's not a fishy website? I got pretty high in my search results, even higher than gnu.org in one instance
[22:46:27] <GNUHacker> is a mirror, not a fishy
[22:46:41] <GNUHacker> that is good
[22:46:59] <GNUHacker> ive also a gnu.org mirror
