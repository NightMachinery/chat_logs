[00:03:46] <awmv> I didn't do any partitioning. It came with two partitions, /dev/vda1 and /dev/vda2, the latter is swap with 2GB. So I would need to take 200 GB out of /dev/vda1 and create /dev/vda3 as Btrfs? I thought Btrfs is like Ext4, like file system that I can choose while creating a partition

[00:48:35] <rocketblast> sorry /wdi i mean /efi
[00:48:44] <p`> no, /boot is /boot, the kernels, initrds, images, etc, are in /boot
[00:49:07] <rocketblast> the boot partition used to be /boot/efi but then they moved it to /efi instead of /boot
[00:49:28] <p`> it's just that efi fires from an esp partition, which has literally no relevance to where linux kernels are
[00:49:30] <rascul> what do you mean by boot partition?
[00:49:51] <rocketblast> rascul where the bootloader is located
[00:49:56] <p`> i'm sorry i'm really trying to just let this drop but you keep saying incorrect things
[00:50:14] <rascul> normally it's installed to the disk at the beginning and in the case of gpt the end
[00:50:19] <rascul> or something
[00:50:24] <rocketblast> p` either let it drop or consult the arch manual like i did: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFI_system_partition
[00:50:30] <NiLon> I prefer the middle
[00:50:32] <rascul> actually no gpt bootloader still at the beginning i think
[00:51:00] <p`> on typical linux systems using uefi the only time linux ever touches a esp partition is to write a grub64x.efi file (or whatever), and then never again
[00:51:12] <p`> it doesn't matter where it's mounted.  it's never mounted, except to install grub

[00:53:46] <p`> now, again, on bios-boot systems, /boot (where kernels/initramfs are stored) being a separate partition is important, contemporarily, because disks are so commonly beyond the max threshold that an mbr boot sector can [defined] read from

[03:33:52] <Sauvin> C++ is not a strict superset of C, and the bulk of the Linux kernel and the GNU userland is written in C.
[03:34:23] <superboot> Is it common for a C dev to be fluent in both?
[03:34:23] <p`> yeah, what spiderman said.  also linux itself and things like posix.1 and basic gnu tools are all C

[03:35:12] <Sauvin> rud0lf, it depends on the compiler, but I do believe most translators have a switch for engaging "C" mode.

[13:22:27] <alkisg> `mount -t tmpfs -o inode32 tmpfs /mnt` produces this in dmesg (and in the output): [  +5,657489] tmpfs: Unknown parameter 'inode32'
[13:22:46] <alkisg> Although, even if I put inode64 there, it shows the same error

[13:44:14] <katp32> arash: for just compressing it, use `tar` to pack it into a single file, then use `gzip` or `bzip2` or (my preference) `xz` to compress it

[13:45:02] <katp32> if you want to be able to access the files in it easily, ie without extracting the whole thing, you can use a squashfs which will let you mount your archive as a filesystem, but you'll lose a little bit of compression doing that

[20:33:47] <Dagmar> Putting the first one in the middle ensures the BIOS/UEFI winds up on the monitor that's in landscape, although it looks awful scaled up _and_ with incorrect aspect from what the BIOS/UEFI expects

[20:34:23] <hodapp> blah. I bought a 4K monitor last year but its VESA mount is in the most inconvenient spot ever for any sort of reasonable mounting
[20:35:10] <Dagmar> hodapp: I had to go on Amazon and buy a 5" block of hardwood to screw firmly into the desk, and then put the stand for the 42" on that, just because otherwise the damn thing was sitting 1/2" off the desk's surface
[20:35:14] <ayecee> Thanatos: common situations for that are if the disk is mounted from another system, or if the directory was from a tar archive prepared on another system.
[20:35:14] <hodapp> the default mount puts the monitor too low, but almots every single aftermarket VESA mount (e.g. the arm mounts) puts the monitor really low, because its mounting holes are so high up the monitor
[20:35:24] <Dagmar> No one really seems to want to make a long-necked monitor mount capable of handling a 42"
[20:35:44] <ThothCastel> Dagmar: it sounds good Dagmar
[20:35:48] <hodapp> and it also puts extra torque on the mount itself because it's away from the center of gravity

Of course port number P must be associated to the client if we want the client to be able to receive a response back from the server. However, the client does not bind P explicitly: the allocated socket is ephemeral. My question is: how long before the operating

[21:05:38] <always_blue> So, if a process sends a UDP packet and then does not do any other network operation it has a port number that it does not use allocated to it for the lifetime of the process?

[22:25:38] <alkisg> LordDragon`: in general, groups and permissions and even ACLs have some issues. For example, if you move a directory from elsewhere INTO a "shared folder", it won't inherit the permissions. To "inherit everything", google for "bindfs", you can recursively set permissions with a "mount" command
[22:26:00] <ananke> sasaasassas: likely many people have, you may want to get to the point
[22:26:21] <Dagmar> alkisg: That's how it's _supposed_ to work
[22:26:42] <alkisg> Dagmar: what part?
[22:26:46] <Dagmar> alkisg: If you copy a directory that's mode 0700 into a directory that's 0755, do you expect the copy to change to 0755?
[22:26:47] <LordDragon`> alkisg: how can i set permission recursively at the time of mount?
[22:27:20] <alkisg> Dagmar: yes, in certain cases shared folders or inherited permissions are required from a directory and to everything below it
[22:27:22] <Dagmar> LordDragon`: You can't, but you can probably tell mount to override the permissions
[22:27:30] <Dagmar> alkisg: No, they're not.
[22:27:30] <LordDragon`> hmm
[22:27:43] <alkisg> LordDragon`: you can, with bindfs
[22:27:49] <alkisg> Dagmar: google bindfs
[22:27:53] <Dagmar> No.
[22:27:55] <LordDragon`> is umask in mount options the same format that chmod uses?
[22:28:05] <alkisg> OK; we've been using it for 10 years now
[22:28:16] <Dagmar> And I've been using Unix for thirty years.

[22:28:31] <alkisg> And my poppa is older than your poppa
[22:28:35] <Dagmar> What you're describing is normal filesystem operations

[23:34:58] <nomagno> I understand it is far more lightweight to do something like this (ioctl) since... well, I literally ONLY need the one feature.
