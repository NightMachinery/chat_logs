[03:21:56] <jkc> kittonian: https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration#iproute2_method

[03:23:10] <jkc> It really isn't.
[03:23:12] <kittonian> there's even a warning saying so on that page
[03:23:21] <kittonian> i need the ability to bring interfaces up and down individually
[03:23:30] <jkc> It's a warning about old, faulty drivers having issues.
[03:23:39] <jkc> Using labeled aliases is an ancient method. That's the right one to use.
[03:23:58] <kittonian> regardless, you can't bring interfaces up and down separately using that method
[03:25:04] <jkc> Even if you use aliases, you're not bringing an interface up or down.
[03:25:12] <jkc> You're using iproute2 on the backend no matter what you do.
[03:25:20] <jkc> "Nowadays ifupdown uses the ip utility from the iproute2 package instead of ifconfig. The newer ip utility does not use the same concept of aliases or virtual interfaces. However, it supports assigning arbitrary names to the interfaces (they're called labels). ifupdown uses this feature to support aliased interfaces while using ip.

[12:01:57] <another|> what seems to be the problem?
[12:02:14] <rudi_s> willow: I'm not 100% sure but I think this is fine. The kernel still starts with eth* but then it gets renamed by systemd/udev to the new naming schema.
[12:02:40] <Khepra> that's what I'm trying to figure out. whether they want ethX or "predictable", and what they did to get there
[12:03:08] <rudi_s> (Btw. I think the new naming schema is really stupid. I instead switched to e0, e1, etc. which is shorter to type and stays the same even when I add/remove network cards or other devices, change my BIOS settings, etc.)
[12:03:28] <willow> found an Ubuntu bug that seems to be the same thing: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/foundations-bugs/2016-June/288092.html    appears to be related to BIOS.  i can confirm that the system in question has a pretty old BIOS
[12:03:49] <rudi_s> willow: How is that a bug that the interface is renamed from eth0 to eno1?
[12:03:58] <willow> Khepra: the interfaces are working properly, however it's a concern to see "eth0" still popping up in the syslog
[12:04:12] <another|> what? why?
[12:04:13] <rudi_s> Ah, it should be something else, not eno1. Well ...
[12:04:31] <nunggu> using names like eth0 and e0 is just the same. the point of new consistent naming scheme is to ensure replacement network adapter get same name
[12:04:31] <rudi_s> willow: That part is fine because the _kernel_ still calls interfaces eth*
[12:05:07] <rudi_s> nunggu: Which is only partly true btw. It works if you replace the exact hardware device, but it breaks horribly and in funny ways when you change anything else in the system.
[12:05:25] <rudi_s> E.g. insert other devices, change BIOS settings (disabling another network device in my case), etc.
[12:05:52] <nunggu> you're right, bit me once when doing a replacement in a remote data center
[12:05:58] <Khepra> the point of "predictable" naming is to use pci topology to name what it _thinks_ is the same hardware in the same pci hiearchy. that sometimes fails miserably
[12:06:01] <rudi_s> Oh, and in some cases the names are horribly wrong. I have to type those quite often so I was really annoyed at ens1f1np1 or similar.
[12:06:14] <rudi_s> s/wrong/long/
[12:06:24] <Khepra> I prefer all ethX naming and I bind them to their MACs. Same thing achieved wihtout its dumb bugs biting me

[12:06:47] <nunggu> Still better than "local network adapter", right?
[12:07:13] <rudi_s> However, from what I heard reusing eth* can cause race conditions (never checked that). So I switched to e0, e1, etc. (and w* for WLAN).
[12:07:15] <willow> the interface names should be consistent

[12:20:00] <another|> still failing to understand what the problem is
[12:20:27] <Khepra> willow: well if you've read that document, then you'd know that ethX is _kernel_ naming. systemd's udev then renames that into "predictable" using pci topology and predefined set of rules. you will always see the "renamed" entry, unless you configure net.ifnames=0 so udev doesn't rename from ethX

[12:34:02] <willow> Khepra: that's backwards.  udev rules are what rename the interfaces to things like eth0.  on debian that happens in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
[12:34:18] <willow> the idea is not to have to have udev tamper with the names

[12:38:53] <another|> you seem to have it backwards
[12:39:20] <willow> does the kernel actually use a name like 'eth0' or does it simply see the device according to the PCI bus and hw id's which it enumerates?
[12:39:24] <another|> the kernel addresses interface with eth*
[12:39:57] <Khepra> willow: no, you have it wrong. ethX is kernel naming. udev then renames that into something else.
[12:40:45] <another|> the autogenerated /etc/udev/rules.d/70* gives persistent names based on MAC address
[12:41:16] <Khepra> and that btw is NOT default on debian, is it?
[12:41:22] <another|> it only exists on older installations which got upgraded
[12:41:45] <Khepra> to retain ethX when transitioning to systemd, with Jessie, yes?
[12:42:17] <another|> default is to rename to eth0 based on mac
[12:42:29] <another|> if upgraded from jessie
[12:42:41] <willow> here's what lshw shows for Gigabit device before and after removing the udev rename rules:
[12:42:55] <willow>  /0/100/1/0       eth0       network        I350 Gigabit Network Connection

[12:43:27] <another|> here's an example from one of my buster machines:
[12:43:29] <another|> SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"
[12:43:32] <Khepra> another|: yeah and probably confusing part here  is that it's renaming _from_ eth0 _to_ eth0, because the first one is eth0 defined by the kernel and the second one is defined by udev, it just spells out the same
[12:44:29] <Khepra> so that rule is defined automatically looking at whatever eth0 was at that point in time.
[12:44:56] <another|> no, it renames from eth* to eth0
[12:45:41] *** Joins: blackout69 (~blackout6@net-37-179-183-91.cust.vodafonedsl.it)
[12:45:44] <another|> it could sometimes be eth1
[12:45:54] <Khepra> correct, and assuming BIOS didn't change it since the moment the rule was defined, that's eth0 to eth0. if the BIOS did change it, it'd then be, say, eth1 to eth0, assuming you had mupltiple NICs
[12:46:09] <another|> yes
[12:46:34] <willow> Khepra: interesting!
[12:46:40] <Khepra> but the MAC address is bound to eth0 if that MAC belonged to 0 at the moment that rule was defined
[12:47:06] <another|> yep
[12:47:08] <Khepra> NAME="eth0" is 0 because, at that moment, ATTR{address} "1:2:3:4:5:6" belonged to eth0 for that boot.
[12:47:20] <Khepra> yeah so we're on the same page here :)
[12:47:55] <budlight> mine got rename to enp10s0

[23:23:49] <brachamh> hey i'm trying to get my scanner working again. had it set up according to https://wiki.debian.org/SaneOverNetwork and it was working, then i went to use it recently and couldn't access it from any client

[23:29:20] <jason1234> brachamh: you likely need SID if you cannot : scanimage -L
[23:29:39] <sney> check apt changelogs for libsane and sane-utils, maybe some setting was affected by a bug fix
[23:29:40] <jason1234> dmesg should give it, in case, you need higher and upgrade to newer.
[23:29:57] <sney> it's unlikely that something that worked previously can only be fixed by using sid in production, but ok.

[23:30:17] <Blondie101010> yeah that sounds bad
[23:30:35] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.45.224)
[23:30:44] <Blondie101010> troubleshooting should be done before concluding
[23:31:54] <Blondie101010> what error does it give?  can the client see the shared scanner?  can you scan from the server?  did you revise the installation guide to validate that everything is running properly?
[23:36:06] <brachamh> both server and client run debian buster, client can't see scanner even from root, a few days ago when i needed to do a scan i connected the scanner directly to the client and it worked just fine
[23:36:35] <brachamh> i wen through the setup guide to make sure everything is right
[23:37:08] <sney> when did it last work over the network? was it before July 25th, when the package had an update in buster?
[23:37:54] <Blondie101010> that might be hard to pinpoint if they use their scanner as often as me
[23:38:32] <brachamh> i think it was after that, hang on

[23:39:15] <Blondie101010> anyways, the first thing to try is to scan directly from the server
[23:39:31] <brachamh> i have a scan from sept 9 that worked normally
[23:39:35] <Blondie101010> then check sane service status and test the connection
[23:40:19] <brachamh> ok i'll have to figure out how to scan from cli
[23:40:48] <Blondie101010> it's included in that guide
[23:40:50] <Blondie101010> scanimage -L
[23:41:00] <brachamh> that lists scanners and yes that finds it
[23:41:29] <Blondie101010> http://uw714doc.xinuos.com/en/man/html.1/scanimage.1.html
[23:41:49] <brachamh> so you want me to actually run a scan?
[23:42:00] <Blondie101010> sure

[23:50:00] <brachamh> the saned.socket is active and listening on ...wait a second

[23:51:21] <sney> I think :: includes all hosts, 4 and 6, but you could hit it with netcat or nmap from the client and see if that port is actuall open from the outside
[23:51:25] <Blondie101010> not necessarily
[23:52:05] <Blondie101010> from the client, can you connect to it with: nc $server 6566
[23:53:52] <brachamh> so: nc 192.168.1.25 6566 ?
[23:53:59] <Blondie101010> yes
[23:54:13] <brachamh> showed nothing
[23:54:38] <Blondie101010> try the exact same command on the server directly
[23:54:41] <Blondie101010> does that connect?
[23:55:19] <sney> run it as 'nc -v 192.168.1.25 6566' so you get the connection reset message, if any
[23:55:49] <brachamh> ok that returned port open
[23:56:19] <brachamh> when i added the -v from the client

[23:57:04] <brachamh> yes
[23:57:15] <sney> ok, double check your saned.conf and make sure your current client ip is the one allowed to use the scanner
[23:57:15] <Blondie101010> "port open"?
