[06:57:10] <signalblue> Anyone still using POP3 as opposed to IMAP in 2022?
[06:58:49] <thumbs> signalblue: unlikely
[06:59:00] <signalblue> Yeah I thought so
[06:59:02] <thumbs> there are a few unique legitimate use cases
[06:59:09] <signalblue> Such as?
[06:59:22] <signalblue> I mean... POP3 can leave mail on server and not delete on download
[06:59:35] <thumbs> migrations from gmail, for instance
[06:59:36] <signalblue> so on that front, it's simillar to IMAP
[06:59:42] <signalblue> true
[06:59:57] <signalblue> I have a question...
[07:00:13] <signalblue> if POP3 does not have the concept of folders, how does spam filtering work?
[07:00:27] <signalblue> does all spam just end up in the inbox?
[07:04:45] <pj> signalblue: That depends on how the email server is configured.
[07:05:08] <signalblue> what do you mean?
[07:05:15] <signalblue> how the MTA is confoguired?
[07:05:21] <signalblue> configured*
[07:06:56] <pj> Maybe the better question is, what happens in a server such as dovecot when a message is delivered to the Spam folder?
[07:08:41] <signalblue> pj: when rspamd or spamassassin marks a message as spam before sending it to dovecot, you mean?
[07:09:50] <pj> signalblue: all that happens is the message is marked in one or more headers, and dovecot will do whatever it wants with it.
[07:10:11] <signalblue> ok that makes sense
[07:10:23] <signalblue> marked by what? the spam filtering software?
[07:10:30] <pj> yes
[07:11:05] <pj> dovecot can be configured via the use of sieve to deliver such messages to an alternative folder, such as Spam
[07:11:21] <signalblue> got it
[07:11:32] <signalblue> I thought that POP3, did not have folders though
[07:11:38] <signalblue> am I wrong?
[07:11:57] <pj> now I'm not entirely sure what POP3 does in that case, it would likely do one of two things, it will either only see messages in the INBOX folder, or it will see all new messages regardless of which folder they get delivered to.
[07:12:12] <signalblue> server-side foldering I mean, I am under the impression that foldering in that protocol is done at the client-side
[07:12:12] <pj> you are correct POP3 does not have folders
[07:12:37] <pj> dovecot will store the messages in folders on the server side.
[07:12:39] <pj> always.
[07:12:58] <pj> the protocol be it IMAP, POP3, or something else doesn't chagne that.
[07:13:20] <pj> the issue with POP3 is it doesn't have a concept of folders in the *protocol*.
[07:13:32] <signalblue> yes
[07:13:45] <signalblue> so Spam would be sent to the inbox?
[07:15:06] <pj> Assuming dovecot sieve is configured to deliver it to the Spam folder it will do exactly that, regardless of the protocol.
[07:15:35] <pj> it may appear in the inbox on the client-side, if dovecot sends that message to the pop3 client, though.
[07:16:11] <signalblue> pj: thank you, also, any tips on getting self-hosted mail to be delivered to the inbox on gmail and microsoft?
[07:16:45] <superkuh> You already have spf+dkim?
[07:16:59] <signalblue> I have all of the normal stuff, rDNS, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, TLS, static IP, domain/IP not blacklisted
[07:17:00] <signalblue> etc
[07:17:13] <superkuh> Not much else you can do. It rarely is about anything you've actually done.
[07:17:26] <signalblue> then what the heck is it about
[07:18:07] <signalblue> I don't send spam and I never intend on doing so
[07:18:26] <signalblue> also the server is not an open relay
[07:18:41] <pj> signalblue: you're already on the right track, gmail can retrieve it via POP3 from dovecot
[07:18:41] <superkuh> Last time for me was the solarwinds hack when the proxying internally for noaa.gov emails I was sending to got broken and spf failed due to their misconfig which caused gmail (which is what noaa.gov was using behind solarwinds) to start marking me as spam.
[07:19:34] <signalblue> that's not fun
[07:20:23] <signalblue> email is not supposed to be entirely in the hands of a few large companies... email is supposed to be democratic
[07:22:01] <pj> signalblue: I would ask on the dovecot mailing list if POP3 will retrieve messages that were delivered to the Spam folder.
