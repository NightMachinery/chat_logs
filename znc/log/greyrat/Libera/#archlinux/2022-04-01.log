[07:39:13] <alloy> I'm getting an error about 2 packages conflicting and need to find out what needs which...
[07:39:22] <alloy> :: nodejs-lts-gallium and nodejs are in conflict. Remove nodejs? [y/N] 
[07:39:59] <alloy> how do I pacman/yay to see what has required these?  btw I don't program in node 
[07:40:22] <Scimmia> alloy: let me guess, you're using atom?
[07:40:23] <Namarrgon> which command gave you that?
[07:40:35] <alloy> Scimmia, good guess!
[07:40:44] <alloy> Namarrgon, just pacman -Syu
[07:41:00] <Scimmia> so apm specifically requires that old version, but something now requires a newer one
[07:41:03] <cyphertite> sheep:  yep:  GTK 4 and libadwaita provide next generation capabilities for GNOME applications, and many GNOME apps have started to use these components for GNOME 42.  More at:  https://release.gnome.org/42/

[07:45:02] <alloy> oooh ok, maybe :)
[07:45:36] <Scimmia> and maybe consider something other than atom, it's pretty dead. That's not bad for a normal program, but something that uses nodejs and electron, it's bad

[07:54:15] <jmariondev> i've been daily driving it on GNOME for more than a year, occasionally something doesn't work but it's rare

When I created a new directory with the user account, the permission is correct (drwxr-x---).  But when I create a file, the the permission is -rw-r-x--- instead of -rwx-r-w--- .   Any idea?

[11:22:56] <Ghosthree3> HaMsTeRs: umask 022 is the default and as you can clearly see, dirs are made with 755 but files are 644, execute is not added by default for files
[11:23:18] <Ghosthree3> (and it should be that way)
[11:25:02] <avN0> Short question to that: scripts can still be executed by running them with the stated "shell/interpreter" directly. The execute bit really just adds security for binaries, doesn't it?
[11:25:35] <Ghosthree3> execute is just required for the file to be run directly by your active shell afaik
[11:25:46] <Ghosthree3> so ./script.sh wont run without +x but sh ./script.sh is fine
[11:25:54] <avN0> ^
[11:26:34] <Ghosthree3> its about whether or not the shebang (#!) is executed or not

[12:24:09] <pagios> PGP question, i understand that ubuntu for example uses PGP to sign packages and verify them. Say i have a website, and i am publishing a software, i sign it and ppl can download and verify using my public key. NOW my website gets comromised, an attacker creates a new package, signs it with its FAKE name which is mine and publishes his key too on the website. Now ppl download it and verigfy it all good. How does PGP protect me in this case
[12:24:09] <pagios> ?

[12:26:21] <artefact> i leave my fingerprint on my github profile, my personal home page and a txt record in my domain name, so to compromise it you'd need to crack all three

[12:30:11] <mpan> pagios: if your private key was not compromised, how would attacker use it to sign a fake package?
[12:30:18] <pagios> you mean ask the clients to Verify the key on some keyservers 
[12:30:19] <omnipotent> Ah ok, I just joined so i cant see any messages above 
[12:30:40] <artefact> mpan: no, the attacker would just put their own key on the compromised webpage
[12:30:44] <pagios> mpan:  he just uploads a new package, isgns it and ask ppl to verify it 
[12:30:54] <pagios> they are verified against his private key
[12:30:56] <pagios> not mine
[12:30:59] <pagios> mine is not compromised
[12:31:11] <mpan> pagios: then the verification against your public key will not succeed.
[12:31:15] <jelle> pagios: then it's up to the user to not get fooled into accepting this new public key
[12:31:21] <mpan> This is the whole point of signatures.
[12:31:31] <nl6720> pagios: for Arch, the PKGBUILD contains the key fingerprint. so the package maintainer should notice

[12:31:38] <Khorne> mpan, thats not the issue here, the verification would be against the attackers public key, because they put it on the website to verify against
[12:31:45] <pagios> so my question is how will the USER know its not my publick key
[12:31:49] <pagios> how will he verify that
[12:31:55] <Khorne> pagios, they don't, use multiple channels
[12:31:56] <pagios> if he is a first comer to the site
[12:31:59] <mpan> Khorne: hmm, ok. 
[12:31:59] <artefact> am i shadow banned? i've awnsered you twice
[12:32:25] <jelle> irc has no shadow ban, but the user can locally ignore you 
[12:32:44] <mpan> pagios: then, assuming Khorne’s interpretation of your question is right, signatures (PGP or not) do not protect against that. As others have said, it’s up to the user to have a valid public keys of yours.

[12:35:07] <mpan> pagios: for that reason people often publish key IDs in multiple places.
[12:35:28] <sorta> mpan: very interesting, thanks. 
[12:36:03] <Khorne> sorta, / is used for more than just installing things, logs, application caches, runtime data for some things, but as usual, it depends
[12:36:33] <mpan> pagios: for example I have that in my forum sig. You can also verify that against what was used to sign git commits (e.g. on GitHub), what was used to sign things released elsewhere etc.
[12:36:48] <sorta> Well I'm wondering when it would be noticeable to a user, would the system randomly hang for instance?
[12:36:57] <mpan> pagios: the best a user can do without having access to such things is see if they can verify a signature of an earlier package, as it will fail too with the fake key.

[14:51:27] <mpan> pulec: also, nothing wrong with temperatures?
[14:51:55] <pulec> hm I didn't check temp
[14:52:29] <mpan> AFAIK HDDs do not have a self-throttle feature, but if the temperature goes up, some components may underperfom, cause instability and prompt the drive to reset.
[14:52:37] <pulec> /dev/sdb: TOSHIBA MG09ACA18TE: 33°C
[14:52:44] <mpan> Not now. When the reset happens.
[14:52:48] <pulec> would make sense but it's fine
[14:53:15] <artefact> could be a single faulty component/IC that's overheating
[14:53:33] <mpan> That too, or other electronic failure, but we have no way of determining that. :/
[14:53:47] <mpan> pulec: nothing in the journal?

[20:16:31] <SysGhost> Reid: you installed and configured the boot loader... but... did you activate it? UEFI or legacy BIOS
[20:16:53] <Reid> UEFI, the bootloader does actually boot but its entries to boot the OS don't show up

[21:15:33] <ramblebamble> vvn, if I understand you correctly it is one way of decrypting the partition, you can have several keyfiles for the same purpose, the master-key is not given to you but kept by luks because that thing is encrypted by pw/keyfile

[21:22:18] <ramblebamble> vvn, that is what I thought you ment and misunderstood, Namarrgon is right `man cryptsetup` . you also have a --dump-master-key which writes the master-key to file and you can then use it later with your option. luks generates a really big key to encrypt your parition, this key in turn is then encrypted using your password or the key-file you provide, this allows you to easily switch passwords
[21:22:20] <ramblebamble> without having to reincrypt the entire hard-drive or have multiple passwords to the same data.
[21:25:47] <vvn> ramblebamble: ho I think I understand what you mean. The various key in their respective slots (passed with --key-file) are in fact keys to decrypt the master key file implicitly generated, or explicitly provided by --master-key-file. Is that correct?
