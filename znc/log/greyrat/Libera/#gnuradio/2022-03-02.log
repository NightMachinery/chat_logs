[05:03:16] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> The things I changed were the filter numbers.  I tried to derive them from other variables.  I also made the transition widths smaller.  I presume that's why my delay is so many more samples longer than yours was, but I don't know for sure.  I'm pretty much a DSP newbie.

[06:11:50] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> Barry Duggan: My goal going forward is to be able to just look at the screen and understand what my flowgraphs do.  Ideally, no need for external notes files or web pages or even to open the blocks up to see what formulas are hidden in them.
[06:13:13] <muaddib[m]> Haven‚Äôt looked at your flowgraph. I‚Äôm a fan of well commented code though. Did you know you can show the variable names and values from within GRC?
[06:15:06] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> drmpeg: The exercise shows there is a delay between the generated tx signal and the recovered rx signal.  I guess I'd address the problem, then, not of getting the absolute best filter, but how to get one suitable for purpose (meeting FCC transmission standards?) while introducing the least delay.

[07:19:01] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> I had written a big note block with comments that was content taken from the FSK_simulation web page.  Then I just decided to add more variable blocks to the flow to show all the expressions used to set the various variables.  If I had known about Menu -> View -> Show parameter expressions maybe I would not have done all that.
[07:20:39] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> drmpeg: Neat!  I know M17 uses RRC filtering.  Guess it is good because it can be done efficiently and doesn't add much delay.
[07:21:24] <muaddib[m]> n1ai:FWIW I prefer to use 'note' blocks and in block comments as you did, the flowgraphs tend to get pretty messy with the expressions shown. If you're going to distribute this as an educational aid, my recommendation would be to stick with what you have and maybe add some note blocks with lines delineating the various sections as i've done here.

[20:28:43] <mhilts[m]> Hello! I am trying to learn more about the GNU Radio scheduler by writing an embedded python (decim) block that takes in 8 random bytes at a time, averages them, and writes the average to the output. I have included the code here: https://pastebin.com/dUgJX7br . When I run the block, I get an error "ValueError: cannot copy sequence with size 16 to array axis with dimension 128", which makes sense since the input is 128, and I want the
[20:28:43] <mhilts[m]> output array to be 16 items long. Is there a way to set a new output length in a python block? Thanks!

[20:29:45] <funkylab[m]> hi! For a not-very-deep intro into scheduling, maybe watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTGxhsSvZ9c
[20:31:41] <funkylab[m]> but your error is a classic one: you're trying to overwrite 128 values with 16 values, and that doesn't work. Instead of appending values to a list, simply put them into their place in output_items[0][...] directly,  and if you want to produce 16 items, why do you tell GNU Radio that you produced as much items as there was output space in your `return`?
[20:34:08] <mhilts[m]> Ah I see, that makes sense! Thank you!
[20:34:18] <funkylab[m]> you're welcome!

[21:24:24] <mhilts[m]> When I have consumed all the random bytes (500 bytes), work() is still called and len(input_items) jumps to 32768. This messes with some of my loops in the block since I am currently I am iterating over input items. Thus my loops get clogged with zeros. Is there a way to tell GNU Radio to stop after the Random Source has produces its 500 bytes?

[21:39:08] <funkylab[m]> but also, if this messes with your block's logic, that's a bug in your block: it needs to be able to deal correctly with any amount of input data.
[21:39:37] <funkylab[m]> of course work() is called multiple times - that's how you can process a (theoretically) infinite stream of samples.
[21:40:49] *** Joins: arch3r (~ben@185.66.194.79)
[21:41:42] <mhilts[m]> Okay! I think I had assumed that the Random Source block would stop the flowgraph once it reached 500 bytes, but I'll make sure my logic is robust enough to handle these inputs. 
[21:43:04] <mhilts[m]> Additionally, I find that the Random Source outputs bytes in powers of 2: for example the first time work() is called, it is on 256 bytes, then 128, 64, 32, 16, and finally 4. Is this just a product of the random source?
[21:43:44] <funkylab[m]> no, this is nothing you can rely on

[22:11:36] <MarcinP[m]> <BarryDuggan[m]> "if you are interested in doing..." <- Barry, can you explain how does it work? Those blocks from the module are suppose to create some general flowgraphs for visualization purposes only? 
[22:12:57] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> So I copied/pasted in the eye diagram from your RTTY_receive.grc flowgraph... It's now in the bottom right of my flowgraph... I turned off the rest of the stuff so I could try to figure out how to use the eye diagram... I copied/pasted the rational resampler and the eye diagram and the sps variable too... I'm not sure if what I'm seeing is correct... It should be, because this is all software with no obvious imparements, right? 
[22:15:06] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> https://youtu.be/GZWies3Rb4k?t=715 is a really excellent explanation of eye diagrams.  It's in the context of 4FSK not RTTY/2FSK so it has four tones instead of two.  It seems to be set up to show two complete symbols not one, so more crossings... Not sure I can say I see the same with my flow graph...
[22:15:51] <MarcinP[m]> DaveCherkusN1AI[: I just opened your flowgraph, my question is, what do you want to observe? You want to know how to use eye diagram only? 
[22:16:07] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> Yes, I want to learn what the eye diagram is telling me.
[22:16:56] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> I am new to this stuff.  The video I just sent is the only thing I know about what eye diagrams are.
[22:16:57] <MarcinP[m]> DaveCherkusN1AI[: I think its not a good example, you better take BPSK and examine that
[22:17:16] <MarcinP[m]> I can help with that
[22:17:39] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> So, in my flow graph I see amplitudes, in theirs I see the FSK tone frequencies... Are they set up differently?
[22:18:50] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> The X axis is 0.044 sec or 44 ms long, that is two RTTY symbols long?
[22:19:10] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> RTTY is 45.45 baud.

[22:23:21] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> Quadrature demod is producing -0,5  and +0.5 so those are the amplitudes? 
[22:26:35] <MarcinP[m]> One again, using eye diagram in this particular example is not the best idea, especially that you want to learn how to use that tool
[22:26:41] <MarcinP[m]> s/One/Once/
[22:30:04] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> Yes, I can imagine this is so.  The bit rate is so slow we don't see many transitions in the diagram.
[22:30:13] <MarcinP[m]> I recommend to use a digital modulation scheme such as BPSK and add matched filter and interpolate the signal. Then attach the eye diagram to see the symbol transitions. Best case would be if you would perform another filtering on the receiver side to see the benefits of the matched filtering on the eye diagram
[22:32:31] <DaveCherkusN1AI[> Yes, TYVM.  I can see why this is so.  My goal is to study M17 which uses 4FSK so I will start working with some of the flowgraphs from that project.  I just wanted to see if I could make RTTY / 2FSK work first.  I'm glad I did, it taught me a lot already!

[23:11:04] <MarcinP[m]> what u see are two symbols at given time span
