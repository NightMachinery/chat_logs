[00:57:42] <rdrg109> Tisoxin: Yes, you can do this by using %(). See a minimal working example here: http://0x0.st/-3AZ.el
[00:59:03] <Tisoxin> frick
[00:59:26] <Tisoxin> you've send the message right at the moment i hacked sth together with org-roam-capture-new-node-hook %)

[03:00:23] <rdrg109> Tisoxin: What problem do you have with org-capture?
[03:01:15] <Tisoxin> well, just that i can't capture sth while org roam captures a node
[03:01:31] <Tisoxin> though iirc org-protocol still works

[03:01:33] <Tisoxin> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[03:01:58] <Tisoxin> but for now i just write the file directly instead of using org-capture
[03:02:07] <rdrg109> Tisoxin: Well, you can't finish the org-roam capture with C-c C-c and continue working in that node in a non-"CAPTURE" buffer.
[03:02:20] <rdrg109> That's what I usually do, so that I don't have problems with multiple captures at the same time.
[03:03:03] <Tisoxin> rdrg109: can't?
[03:03:33] <rdrg109> As far as I know, when you C-c C-c in a "CAPTURE" buffer, the buffer remains visible (the position of the buffer in the frame might change).
[03:03:40] <rdrg109> wdym "can't"?
[03:04:38] <Tisoxin> rdrg109: Do you not mean, that i can finish the org-roam capture?
[03:05:01] <Tisoxin> (maybe i'm just too tired to read)
[03:06:36] <Tisoxin> rdrg109: also: i wan't to automatically capture a task when i use a certain template…
[03:13:34] <rdrg109> Tisoxin: Yes. I mean that you can finish the org-roam capture to solve the issue of "can't capture sth while org roam captures a node".
[03:14:25] <Tisoxin> yeah, but i'm not sure how i'd delay the capturing of the task in a working way

[08:22:53] <rdrg109> [Q] How to index everything in the database again?
[08:31:18] <nickanderson[m]> To build the cache manually, run M-x org-roam-db-sync. Cache builds may take a while the first time, but subsequent builds are often instantaneous because they only reprocess modified files.

[08:37:14] <rdrg109> nickanderson[m]: Thanks for the information. I will check it out. As a solution, I crafted this function: http://0x0.st/-3BT.el
