[15:08:06] <Fohsap> on android, there is a feature on the official openvpn app that allows the user to choose which apps do and which apps do not go through the vpn.  Is it possible to choose which apps should not go through the vpn on a windows machine?
[15:16:09] <BtbN> not in any sane way

[15:24:26] <Fohsap_> sorry i got disconnected.  Thanks for the answer.  So there's no easy way to make an exception for two apps?
[15:25:00] <Fohsap_> Well, I kind of want to make exceptions for more than two, but if I installed openvpn to my router somehow would that make it easier?  Or.. maybe I could use two ISPs?
[15:28:58] <plaisthos> Fohsap_: not really that easy I am afraid
[15:29:06] <plaisthos> on Android the OS gives you a nice API for that
[15:29:12] <Fohsap_> Well, thank you for letting me know.
[15:29:19] <plaisthos> on windows there is no easy way to redirect traffic by app
[15:29:27] <plaisthos> so you need to come up with something on your own
[15:30:06] <Fohsap_> Yeah, they have a vpn service that does that.  I used it at a friend's house.  Maybe they'd be willing to share their secrets with me. XD
[15:30:53] <plaisthos> it is probably doable to reverse engineer how they are doing it
[15:32:46] <Fohsap_> https://r1ch.net/projects/forcebindip maybe this?
[15:33:06] <Fohsap_> https://superuser.com/questions/168177/disable-vpn-for-a-given-process-application sorry this was the link I meant to send.
[15:34:49] <Fohsap_> "This will ensure that traffic for your application bypasses the VPN and goes straight out through your default gateway and out onto the internet." Maybe I should ask #networking if that's really how default gateways work.
[15:42:28] <plaisthos> might work. You need to check yourself
[15:42:44] <plaisthos> I am not that familiar with Windows networking
[15:45:21] <plaisthos> WAAAAAH
[15:45:26] <plaisthos> I already hate fragment code
[15:45:34] <plaisthos> and all the magic it does to buffer/frame code
[15:48:57] <plaisthos> only one of --tun-mtu or --link-mtu may be defined (note that " "--ifconfig implies --link-mtu %d
[15:49:05] <plaisthos> ifconfig implies link-mtu?!
[15:49:09] *** jca2 is now known as jca
[16:02:26] <Fohsap_> aw man i wish i understood those words.  Maybe I should go to school for networking and after a few years create an openvpn bible. :D
[16:07:16] <Fohsap_> so they have the advanced option to compress your downlink.  To what extent does compression make the link less secure?

[17:32:45] <Fohsap_> rob0 Well, there are some apps that I use frequently that only work in my region, and sometimes I need to use them for an extended period of time so rather than toggling my vpn on and off, I want to find a way to only allow that one app to bypass my vpn on PC.
