[18:39:24] <yashasolutions> hi, where does org-agenda-files values get stored when using C-c [ ? I have some of my agenda files who got removed (restructured) and it still somehow get set to this old value, and I cannot removeit from there... (setting the value in the config file get overwritten later I don't know why/where/how)
[18:45:41] <grym> is there a way to tell org to open org files with the cursor at the first heading, if there is one present?  I use speedkeys a lot and it's annoying to re-open a file and have the cursor on a :DRAWER of config options and then inevitably type like four characters into the buffer 
[19:12:12] <TitanOfOld> yashasolutions: Where ever custom.el is stored
[19:16:55] <yashasolutions> TitanOfOld: perfect! found it thanks!

[19:41:21] <rdrg109> grym: I would create a hook that would execute search-forward for the following regular expression "^*" and move the cursor in the first match.
[19:42:20] <rdrg109> Why would you inevitably type four characters? Is it because most of the times your Org Mode file contain a headline in the first line?
[19:44:02] <rdrg109> Also, I didn't know that :PROPERTIES: could be used at the beginning of the file. I used to set properties at the file level by using "#+PROPERTY: HEADER-ARGS:<<language>>: :results output", but I will use the :PROPERTIES: drawer for needing to type less characters.
[19:44:59] <grym> rdrg109: i keep wanting to type `nv` to jump into an agenda and then type a few more ns to skip ahead to some todos
[19:45:19] <grym> https://orgmode.org/manual/Speed-Keys.html
[19:45:39] <grym> and i have a few custom ones, like `o` which is bound to counsel-outline
[19:46:17] <rdrg109> I didn't know of Speed Keys. Thanks! :)
[19:46:45] <grym> it's handy, until you start typing four or five of them into the buffer... :) 
[19:47:15] <grym> and yeah, most of my org files start with a :display-options: drawer or the like
[19:48:00] <rdrg109> What's the :display-options:? I don't find an ocurrence in the Info Manual.
[19:48:52] <grym> i don't know if it's anything, actually, but it's a valid :name: to collapse some stuff into
[19:49:20] <rdrg109> Oh, I see, I thought it was a drawer that Org Mode used for changing the behavior of some built-in function.
[19:49:32] <grym> i don't think it is
[19:56:42] <rdrg109> grym: In conclusion, one could create a :PROPERTIES: drawer at the beginning of the file and this would make the property to be available in all the file. This means that we get the same behavior of "#+PROPERTY:", but now there is no need to C-c C-c on the "#+PROPERTY" line in order for the property to be taken into consideration, so this is an advantage.
[19:57:04] <grym> rdrg109: yes.  that one i knew; it's how i tell org where to find my virtualenvs
[19:57:08] <grym> (or, part of it)
[19:58:46] <rdrg109> Another advantage is that since, you might prefer :PROPERTIES: rather than "#+PROPERTY" at the beginning of the file, org-keyword-properties is now used anymore (since it is updated with the "#+PROPERTY" lines, but now you won't use them anymore). This means that you could use org-keyword properties for evaluating sexps which I explain in this post:

[19:59:34] <rdrg109> I guess, it's time for another blog post giving more details on this.

[21:34:05] <lisp123> Can I create my own custom languages in org mode (e.g. #+BEGIN_SRC custom-lang ... #+END_SRC?
[21:35:29] <grym> sure, but you'll probably want to build a babel backend for it 
[21:35:35] <grym> otherwise org won't know what to do 
[21:36:13] <lisp123> grym: thanks. For now I just want to have it so I can extract code blocks for that language, and not run any execution (i'll do that later)
[21:36:20] <lisp123> i assume that is fine?

[22:23:14] <rdrg109> lisp123: Without defining an Org Babel backend, you would only get syntax highlighting and you will be able to use generic headers arguments: :tangle, :prologue, :epilogue and probably some more.
[22:23:28] <rdrg109> What do you mean with "extract code blocks for that language"?
[22:23:50] *** Joins: selfsymmetric-mu (~matt@c-73-10-148-139.hsd1.nj.comcast.net)
[22:28:26] <lisp123> rdrg109: I want to use org-elements later to parse an .org doc into an AST and then I want to extract all code blocks with language = custonm-language
[22:29:50] <rdrg109> You don't need to define a Org Babel backend for that, so you are good. Creating a backend is only necessary for executing those code blocks, but you only want to consume their contents, so there is no need to do that.
[22:30:10] <lisp123> rdrg109: many thanks for the confirmation :)
