[17:42:50] <renaud> wow, I verified the subject of mails sent by sparkpost and it's almost 100% spam
[17:42:50] *** Joins: aisha[m] (~aisha@2001:470:69fc:105::13a)
[17:43:45] <renaud> I have only seen 1 message that might not have been spam, although debatable
[17:44:32] <jrmu> would you recommend spamassassin or rspamd for spam filters?
[17:45:04] <jrmu> or milter or spamd, I am confused with the options
[17:45:20] <renaud> I have rspamd, but it only detects very few of them
[17:45:22] <jrmu> I'm looking for something that is simple, but I saw criticism of the greylisting used by spamd
[17:45:58] <jrmu> http://articles.marco.org/238
[17:46:00] <renaud> greylisting isn't as efficient as it used to be, you have big chances of losing mails
[17:46:15] <renaud> and a high maintenance as you need to manage a lot of whitelists
[17:46:36] <jrmu> yeah arment basically argues it ruins the joy of fast email
[17:47:05] <renaud> also, for things like sparkpost spam, it's 100% useless
[17:47:23] <jrmu> I guess spamd is not for me then
[17:47:53] <renaud> in your article: Greylisting destroys email as an instant communication medium <-- email has never been intended to be an instant communication medium
[17:48:24] <renaud> I stopped using greylisting almost 10 years ago
[17:50:16] <renaud> also, the default config of spamd is somewhat very restrictive
[17:50:32] <renaud> that said, you could still use spamd, but in blacklist only mode
[17:51:16] <jrmu> which do you think is simplest to learn and simplest to configure, spamassassin or rspamd or milter?
[17:51:31] <jrmu> i'm looking for the simplest, lightest solution
[17:52:00] <renaud> spamassassin is the easiest to configure, but rspamd is faster and ligther
[17:52:16] <renaud> milter is, well, don't make me say it :)
[17:52:38] <jrmu> ah, interesting
[17:52:59] <renaud> rspamd in opensmtpd is just 'filter rspamd proc-exec "filter-rspamd"'
[17:53:15] <renaud> and include it in a listen with filter rspamd
[17:53:46] <jrmu> that looks pretty simple
[17:53:49] <renaud> it is
[17:53:53] <jrmu> nice, thanks
[17:54:13] <renaud> but if you want to tweak rspamd config, it might take you some time
[17:54:24] <renaud> and it's probably not that needed anywya

[20:40:06] <rak> I've been using spamd + rspamd for years. It's not perfect, in that some spam gets through every few days, but it's still pretty good.
[20:40:50] <rak> I could probably drop spamd and just go with rspamd, but I like the idea of wasting spammers' time. 
[20:42:24] <rak> I'm still a bit sad bgp-spamd died. It was helpful for low-volume hosts like mine.
