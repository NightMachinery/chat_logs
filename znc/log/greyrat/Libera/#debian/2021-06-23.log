[08:09:17] <brachamh> hmm...i just switched everything over to a new (to me) laptop, have libre office installed, connect to my server's samba share, try to open a libre-office calc file (.ods), it appears to start loading, but then doesn't finish loading
[08:10:15] <sney> narrow down the issue. can you open a local ods file? can you copy files from the samba share, create,modify etc? 
[08:11:05] *** Joins: gce108 (~gce@user/gce108)
[08:11:21] <brachamh> i copied the file to the local system, opened it, edited it, saved it. that all works fine

[08:12:18] <brachamh> what's that mean?
[08:12:53] <sney> samba/cifs uses "permission denied" as a catchall error for a lot of things 
[08:13:00] <sney> but probably, there's some issue with getting r/w access on the share.

[08:29:30] <sney> in order to rule out gvfs weirdness, I'd suggest mounting this share directly (e.g. with mount, or in fstab or with a systemd .mount unit) instead of with the gui file manager 
[08:29:48] <sney> apparmor is doing something there, I guess, but it says "allowed" so not likely a problem 
[08:31:17] <brachamh> ok seeing as there is a password on the share, it will take me a bit to set up, which i'm not up for tonight...i need to crash, but i'll figure it out tomoorrow evening. thank you, sney! i'll probably be back with either more questions or a positive update tomorrow evening.

[08:54:04] <blluis> channel and they told me about networking.

[08:58:37] <sney> blluis: is that on a home connection? some ISPs filter/drop webserver traffic 
[08:59:14] <blluis> Its not filtered because adyacent ports and the same port was used to test some other services and work
[09:00:36] <sney> adjacent ports would be irrelevant. but if you have public reachability on tcp/80 with daemons other than apache, that might not be it, but ISPs can use application layer filtering too and match http traffic 
[09:00:49] <sney> do you have https listening on 443? have you tested that as well?

[09:01:53] <blluis> Other ports, the same port, to apache machine, to the same machine and other services, to another machine with only one nic an a webserver, all works ok, so its not filtered on my ISP, that was my first test.
[09:02:57] <blluis> One month ago, before the dual nic it was working well.

[16:12:19] <ratrace> those mce errors tho
[16:13:09] <abrotman> don't think you'll be able to resolve those
[16:13:20] <abrotman> maybe a bios update?
[16:16:58] <PMT> oh that's fun
[16:17:17] <PMT> the ACPI errors are probably correctable with nontrivial effort if a simple BIOS update doesn't
[16:17:25] <PMT> getting MCEs on the other hand is a bad time
[16:18:28] <abrotman> also, I doubt either of those are responsible for your system issues
[16:19:08] <PMT> I would agree, unless there's a bunch of them more than 2 seconds after boot around where it's stalling.
[16:20:23] <ulu> ok, so if these are not responsible for the system freeze issues I tend to ignore them for now
[16:21:04] <ulu> the freeze occurs only when I am using a browser. 
[16:22:07] <ulu> I tried runnig vmstat and iostats but I can't check them during the freeze because I cannot even switch the focused window to see what they show
[16:22:20] <ulu> do they keep a log somewhere?
[16:22:40] <PMT> vmstat and iostat do not, as far as I know, log anywhere on their own. You could try outputting them to a file.
[16:22:58] <abrotman> have you disabled various plugins?
[16:23:08] <abrotman> or tried another browser?
[16:23:40] <PMT> How long do these freezes last, when did they start, and does dmesg show anything new around when they occur?
[16:23:41] <ulu> it happens with both firefox-esr (official deb) as well as Brave (3rd parth deb)
[16:24:23] <PMT> Also, does smartctl -a on your hard drive report anything exciting?
[16:24:33] <abrotman> have you checked 'sar' output?

[16:25:01] <PMT> oh dear.
[16:25:33] <ulu> abortman, I have no plugins in the browser
[16:25:58] <ulu> dmesg does not indicate anything around the time of the freeze

[16:28:23] <abrotman> You can use sar to see if maybe you can look at CPU/Swap/Memory consumption over time
[16:28:44] <abrotman> it might not be a CPU issue, but instead, something is consuming a ton of RAM, and your system is trying to swap/kill processes

[16:42:07] <ulu> yeah part of the problem is that it is unpredicatble and difficult to recreate

[19:06:40] <neilthereildeil> this is a debian question because i want to attach to a general process and run gdb commands

[22:47:27] <PMT> That's going to depend on your motherboard vendor. There's the LVFS service for allowing Linux firmware updates, but that requires your vendor participate.

[22:50:22] <uefibios> How can i know whether the 70 MB BIOS/UEFI file is a DOS or Windows one?

[23:39:51] <jmcnaught> I checked old install manuals and the first to include instructions for USB was sarge (3.1), which is before hybrid ISOs.  It says to "zcat boot.img.gz > /dev/sd…" and then copy a netinst ISO to the FAT filesystem it copies to the drive.
[23:40:47] <tesseract> bullseye hexchat shows two notification when someone refer you
[23:40:59] <jmcnaught> As far as I know cp would have always worked for copying images to USB, since block devices are represented as files under /dev.

[23:51:51] * redstar rolling eyes when buster users attacking me for promoting Debian 11 codenamed: Bullseye
[23:52:06] <PMT> ?
[23:52:40] <randall> redstar: Nobody spoke between your two statements ...
[23:52:41] *** Joins: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras)
[23:52:51] <redstar> they was silenced me for more than a week because I encouraged users to use Debian 11
[23:52:57] <redstar> on this channel on buster allowed
[23:53:31] <sney> debian 11 isn't out yet, and #debian is for stable support, yes 
[23:53:46] <redstar> lololololol
[23:53:53] *** Quits: uefibios (~uefibios@213.37.0.211.static.user.ono.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:53:57] <sney> "attacked" and "silenced" may be a stretch though. or maybe you're just hostile. 
[23:53:57] *** Joins: Steeve (~steve@user/steeve)
[23:54:22] <redstar> why promoting Debian 11 is "hostile"
[23:54:26] <redstar> ?
[23:54:51] <redstar> you have problem with the new kernel or something?
[23:55:02] <wintersky> gates prefers stealing than pro bono
[23:55:16] <redstar> Saying that people should not use Debian 11 will lead to brutal 0 day exploits
[23:56:01] <sney> debian stable users should update to debian 11 once it's released. until then, it's fine for experienced users, but "promoting" it is premature 
[23:56:09] <redstar> those patches in Debian 11 fixing critical vulnerabilities in the kernel and other software

[23:57:51] <redstar> I talked with 1984 ehf in Iceland (https://1984.is or https://1984hosting.com) they allowing you to mount Debian 11 and install it on your VPS. 
[23:57:52] <randall> redstar: Please also adhere to channel etiquette, which means sticking to Debian support, and neither attacking other channel members, nor promoting other distros, nor claiming that bullseye has been released.
[23:59:52] <redstar> I specifically requested 1984 to add Debian 11 to the available ISOs, you can test it out at https://1984.is they have VPS for a few dollars and you get a console too :)
