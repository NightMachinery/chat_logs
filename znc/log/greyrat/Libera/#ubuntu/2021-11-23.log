[07:05:16] <eletious> I'm looking to get some auditory feedback as I type and as output is printed... It's a weird sensory thing, I think.  I noticed that a lot of platforms designed to keep up user engagement use auditory cues to do it - mostly video games, but also social media platforms like Snapchat and Facebook Messenger.  I'm wondering if I can leverage that sort of auditory attention hack for my own use.
[07:07:44] <carnophage2> ...
[07:07:51] <eletious> it's weird, I know
[07:07:55] <orange1> you can program it with sdl or maybe x libraries and pulse audio libraries but sdl without a window would be easier

[07:17:35] <sarnold> but one of the gui terminals like alacritty or urxvt or gnome-terminal etc might be easier to hook up to a sound playing API
[07:18:22] <eletious> Yeah, trying to build a terminal emulator would be madness.
[07:19:32] <eletious> I'll start with bucklespring, since it seems like the best option short-term... modifying tmux or an existing gui terminal would be a more long-term project and definitely not an easy one.  Though maybe an insightful one.

[07:28:23] <lotuspsychje> i actualy like the idea of a terminal sound, but i would be more interested in any movement on screen
[07:29:11] <eletious> That's a really good way of putting what I'm looking for, though initially I thought getting feedback in a TTY would be easier than setting it up for a whole OS
[07:29:53] <eletious> To be fair that's probably still true

[17:26:15] <EugenMayer> Hello. Trying to bootstrap a focal instance (current stable release) with cloud-init on openstack. While debian works as expected and picks up the DHCP pushed DNS, ubuntu does only show them in resolvectl status, but ping/dig does not work. (i use a private DNS server for looking up private domains)
[17:26:27] <EugenMayer> Are there any issues regarding that with netplan?

[17:57:00] <TJ-> EugenMayer: I think you're missing the point - the order isn't fixed, it's round-robin for equal nameservers. So even though you're sometimes seeing 10.10.0.243 first, it isn't guaranteed to remain that way. A few millseconds of latency on the network when a query is in flight and resolved will rotate to the other nameserver. Same on the host where 1.1.1.1 is first
[17:57:28] <TJ-> EugenMayer: you should not be handing out 2 nameservesr via the same DHCP lease if those nameservers are not equal

[18:04:30] <TJ-> If it's the same, then you need to compare the generated networkd configuration in case there is a subtle difference. As its using netplan those are runtime so you'll find them under /run/systemd/network/*.network

[21:06:07] <natewrench123456> tomreyn, hmm its unavailable without setting a password
[21:06:53] <tomreyn> natewrench123456: keep "secure boot" disabled, i was just wondering what its status is. i understand you're saying it's disabled, correct?

[21:11:07] <tomreyn> natewrench123456: do you dual-/multi-boot there, or will ubuntu be the only operating system?
[21:12:09] <natewrench123456> tomreyn, i used to use win 10 but now it seems like arch or fedora based distros work i must've screwed up flashing the bios because certain distros like ubuntu will not initalize the hard drive
[21:13:17] <natewrench123456> tomreyn, i definitely screwed up the bios i can only use legacy booting
[21:13:18] <tomreyn> natewrench123456: if one linux distribution works as expected and another doesn't, it's often just a matter of kernel versions.
[21:13:48] <natewrench123456> if ubuntu uses UEFI for its install then thats why it wont work
[21:13:56] <tomreyn> natewrench123456: if this laptop is 5 years old, then it probably defaults to uefi booting. so you could just resetit to manufacturer defaults
[21:13:56] <natewrench123456> dammit
[21:14:01] <natewrench123456> i did
[21:14:27] <tomreyn> ubuntu can install in either uefi or legacy bios mode. but on a laptop that's 5 years old, i would suggest installing in uefi mode
[21:14:46] <natewrench123456> if i put the laptop in uefi mode then it cant find any bootable devices
[21:14:56] <tomreyn> what is "it"?
