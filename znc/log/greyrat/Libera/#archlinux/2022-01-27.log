[04:00:16] <aruhier> but anyway, it's just to say that I have enough background to understand ipv6 allocations, but that's not the issue here
[04:01:24] <aruhier> it's that the hack right now is to use the `ip=` param of the kernel, which is ipv4 only (and supposed to be for NFS)
[04:02:09] <aruhier> so I found a script and a hook to add in the initramfs, that uses a custom `ipv6=` kernel param to configure a static ipv6 in the initramfs

[04:54:00] <norbert> grub failing to boot on btrfs with multiple devices: I have Arch root on a btrfs subvolume in /subvolumes/arch/root, and booting *most of the time* (but not always) fails with "no signature". Interestingly: `ls (hd2,gpt3)/subvolumes/arch` works and shows `root`, but `ls (hd2,gpt3)/subvolumes/arch/root` gives `error: no signature`. I am not using secure boot.

[04:54:37] *** Quits: Voidwarper (~void@user/voidwarper) (Quit: Voidwarper)
[04:54:41] <norbert> My feeling is that the files of `root` are on disks that are not activated somehow. The btrfs multiple devices spans 6 disks, some on SATA, some on NVMe.
[04:54:54] <norbert> One on PCIe extension board for SATA.
[04:55:30] <norbert> Could there be some timing issue with setting up the nvme/pci-sata stuff that hides the data of some directories to grub?
[04:55:36] <Namarrgon> in cases like these you want a separate /boot on something simple, not md-btrfs

[04:56:36] <norbert> Namarrgon: ok, that is of course a solution, but there should be a different one, since when I boot into the Debian grub (separate boot entry) all works, including booting Arch from the Debian boot.
[04:57:06] <norbert> I compared the grub-install calls for the two, Debian installs the shimx64 or so (despite Secure boot not activated on my system).

[07:42:20] <norbert> So the leaves either a missing module or some timing issue (loading of the bigger grub image takes more time). Will do more experiments.

[14:46:31] <wunit> labrador: that sounds backwards
[14:46:43] <The-Compiler> yeah, and then you have Snaps and Flatpaks and unofficial repositories because it turns out that users of stable distributions actually don't want the 2 year old software they signed up for
[14:46:59] <libh> Snaps are terrible, but flatpak isn't really the devil.
[14:47:11] <The-Compiler> so now every package just ships half an operating system with it, which might or might not be up to date :D
[14:47:15] *** Joins: meireikei (~anon@gateway/tor-sasl/meireikei)
[14:47:33] <Earnestly> I think flatpak/appimage, at least from my view, is mostly to run out of date software, or software that depends on out of date libraries
[14:47:53] <BrainDamage> or closed source sw
[14:47:59] <Earnestly> Yeah
[14:48:32] <Earnestly> I used to use freecad appimage because building it was too fraught and too hard going on my laptop (when bad thermals)
[14:49:27] <Earnestly> libh: Last count, long ago though, put Arch at about 35% out of date
[14:50:01] <jaawerth> yeah, I use appimages sometimes to grab nightlies for things where I want a *somewhat* stable daily driver and don't want to build every time, and I've got a couple things in place to not let them stagnate, but I'm leery of the whole shared library thing for anything that may touch ssl et al

I had a script that iterated through packages and presented commits since last build.  Of about 200 packages, I had basically no maintainence burden.)
[14:51:16] <jaawerth> snap seems to have the same security/perms problem as other things, where the ability to opt in/out of capabilities is such a mess it ends up bein all-or-nothing

[18:30:04] <MrElendig> tatsumaru: just add a file to templates
[18:30:11] <MrElendig> you can add any filetype you want
[18:30:40] <Khorne> bjorg, they are in util-linux
[18:30:42] <bug2000> I'm trying to start mpd and get the following error; server_socket: bind to '0.0.0.0:6600' failed (continuing anyway, because binding to '[::]:6600' succeeded): Failed to bind socket: Address already in use
[18:30:49] <bug2000> But `ss -tulpen` doesn't list anything that's using port 6600.

[20:19:02] <bbju> BTW, what does split packages mean? Google points me to the man page for pkgbuild. But that paragraph doesn't make much sense to me. Sorry, guys. I just installed Arch, so I got a lot of questions.
[20:19:20] <mpan> bbju: multiple packages built from a single PKGBUILD.
[20:19:54] <BrainDamage> split packages require so much special handling :/
[20:20:09] <gumbo> bbju: welcome, i just intalled 4 days ago :D
[20:20:29] <gumbo> actually 2 days ago, i was on manjaro
[20:20:35] <mpan> bbju: they are employed usually when multiple different separate are needed, but in terms of building they often share a considerable part or are built from the same source. That simplifies the build process and makes it faster.
[20:21:29] <mpan> bbju: but the downside is that there is no direct 1:1 relation between a PKBUILD and a package and a change in one package effectively makes all of them to be rebuilt.

[21:17:00] <MrElendig> diniboy: because said policy is really basic, it doesn't cover all packages etc

According to https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire#Sharing_audio_devices_with_computers_on_the_network I have to load the pulse module module-zeroconf-discover but that package depends on pulseaudio which conflicts with pipewire. I've installed pipewire-zeroconf but that doesn't seem to do anything. Could somebody help

[23:01:54] <poisond> just restarting pulse on the server side?
