[03:30:40] <thurstylark> does passwd use pam to do that auth, or does it do that directly?

[04:23:31] <securethemews_> could be to do with the fact you're including the timezone in your string
[04:23:42] <securethemews_> try `date -u -d "1970-12-31T23:59:59 - 1 year"`

[04:24:55] <jmcantrell> that doesn't error, but it also doesn't produce the correct answer
[04:25:52] <jmcantrell> 1970 minus one year is 1972?
[04:26:46] <jmcantrell> does this have to do with epoch seconds going negative before 1970-01-01?
[04:28:43] <securethemews_> try `date -u -d "1970-12-31T23:59:59 - 1 second"` and you might get your answer
[04:29:18] <jmcantrell> yeah, that works, but it's not the arithmetic i need. i'm decrementing by years
[04:30:45] <securethemews_> interestingly that doesn't work for me

[04:46:21] <tirnanog> jmcantrell: odd. "1970-01-01T00:00:00 1 year ago" works. "1970-01-01T00:00:00 -1 year" doesn't, even though the documentation states that it ought to be equivalent. on the other hand, throw in a time zone item, and the latter form suddenly works e.g. "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z -1 year".
[04:46:45] <tirnanog> seems fishy to me.

[16:53:42] <moviuro> I'm trying to build a specific systemd version with patches that hopefully fix issues with IPv6PrivacyExtensions not being honored. I cloned the svn-to-git repo, and edited the systemd PKGBUILD as follows: changed pkgver to 249.3; added 2 git commits to _backports=('..' '..'). Now, when I try to makepkg, it complains about gpg signatures. I tried importing the ID (which **worked**) but `systemd

[16:59:01] <ice99> does gpu offloading works in wayland?
[16:59:18] <MrElendig> ice99: depending on what you mean by gpu offloading, maybe
[16:59:47] <ice99> MrElendig, like using the discrete gpu for rendering when launching an app
[17:00:01] <MrElendig> mostly, somewhat compositor dependent
[17:00:08] <MrElendig> and of course if you have nvidia or not
[17:00:17] <ice99> it's nvidia
[17:00:28] <MrElendig> (nvidia will get better now that its no longer using egl)
[17:01:05] <ice99> so it's possible to have nvidia the primary gpu for wayland session?
[17:01:12] <Scimmia> moviuro: what did you start from?
[17:01:16] <Namarrgon> moviuro: why all the unrelated changes to the PKGBUILD when all you wanted was to test two commits?

[17:01:49] <moviuro> https://x0.at/1kd0.txt
