[20:26:35] <kittonian> hi all. seeing a very strange issue with connecting to trackers via BiglyBT and Torguard's VPN. If I enable additionally connecting through a Socks proxy, rarbg's trackers connect without issue and downloads are nice and fast. If I take Socks out of the equation, I can't connect to the trackers at all. I can connect to other trackers over udp. This led me to believe that rarbg was blocking TG's VPN IP range, but this also a
[20:26:35] <kittonian> ppears not to be the case because I can use netcat from a terminal window when connected to the VPN and query the tracker domain/port and immediately get a succeeded response.
[20:26:53] <kittonian> TG's support has been of little help (been going back and forth with them for two days now)
[20:27:51] <kittonian> I used to use their Socks proxy in addition to just the VPN connection but they have made some big changes with their proxy service and the connections to them fail 99/100 times you try, which is why I'm trying to resolve this issue
[20:35:35] <TheSHAD0W> It's possible Torguard's VPN is modifying the html response and mangling the messaging for the client.
[20:36:19] <TheSHAD0W> If you can capture the response data and post it we can take a look...
[20:37:01] <TheSHAD0W> I should say "http response" and not "html", since it isn't; but it may be assuming html and modifying it.
[20:55:20] <kittonian> how would I do that?
[20:55:27] <kittonian> happy to pastebin whatever might help
[20:55:41] <TheSHAD0W> Wireshark can, if it's http.
[20:56:01] <kittonian> this is a udp://9.rarbg.to:2870/announce tracker
[20:56:13] <TheSHAD0W> Oh, udp tracker is different.
[20:56:18] <kittonian> and like I said, other udp trackers work just fine, but not rarbg's
[20:56:45] <TheSHAD0W> You can still use wireshark to capture comms, though it's a bit more complicated.
[20:57:04] <kittonian> the only way I can connect to rarbg's trackers is if I configure BiglyBT to additionally use a Socks proxy (which Torguard's new versions of fail miserably)
[20:57:51] <kittonian> plus, I can use netcat via terminal to connect to 9.rarbg.to 2870 and it immediately returns succeeded
[20:58:06] <kittonian> so it doesn't look to be blocked in any way
[20:58:13] <TheSHAD0W> Netcat is http correct?
[20:58:17] <kittonian> no
[20:58:25] <kittonian> that's how you test udp connections
[20:58:30] <TheSHAD0W> Okay.
[20:58:57] <TheSHAD0W> Again, wireshark could let you look at the comms and get some idea of what's happening.
[21:00:27] <kittonian> i've used wireshark before. unless you know about every hop and have control over them, it's not going to be helpful, especially in a situation where it works over socks, and other udp trackers work with or without socks
[21:01:03] <TheSHAD0W> No, you can only look at it on your end, see if any traffic is coming back.
[21:04:01] <kittonian> sure, but like I said, I do get a response from terminal via netcat
[21:04:05] <kittonian> so I know it's responding
[21:04:28] <TheSHAD0W> But if you look at your client trying to talk to it you can see what it's sending back.
[21:05:22] <kittonian> ok, so let's assume i do exactly that and i see it's sending back whatever, what do i do about it?
[21:05:45] <TheSHAD0W> IDK, depends on what's happening.
[21:15:23] <TheSHAD0W> Maybe rarbg is sending back oversized packets, they're fragmenting and nord is rejecting fragmented packets.
[21:15:29] <TheSHAD0W> Who knows.
[21:36:05] <kittonian> it's torguard, not nord, but regardless, if that's the case why would it work through a socks proxy?
[21:36:56] <kittonian> that's what i'm saying. unless there's something to try to resolve it, all of this doesn't really equate because I've been testing various data flows and potential solutions for two days
[21:37:28] <TheSHAD0W> Can't see what's going on from here, so...  <shrug>
[21:37:37] <kittonian> and as I have no control over torguard nor rarbg, the only thing i can do is understand why something would work through a socks proxy but not without
[21:37:57] <TheSHAD0W> Most you can do is get some sort of indication of what's going on and send a complaint to whomever is responsible.
[21:38:25] <kittonian> well i assure you that rarbg wouldn't care what i sent them, and I'm already working with torguard
[21:38:56] <TheSHAD0W> Well, sending torguard a capture might help.
[21:39:00] <TheSHAD0W> Or it might not.
[21:39:24] <kittonian> i'm not setting up wireshark unless that's the last resort and they specifically ask for it
[21:39:49] <kittonian> thus far they are still doing the, disable your antivirus and let us know bullshit
[21:41:51] <phc> who's "they" ?
[21:43:56] <The_8472> Are you sure that the socks proxy even does anything? many don't even support UDP. maybe it's triggering some fallback to http?
[21:44:05] <The_8472> or the socks proxy bypasses the vpn and that happens to make it work
[22:19:46] <kittonian> The_8472, that i'm not sure of but it seems odd that I would be connected to the VPN and then tell BiglyBT to also proxy that connection and it would somehow bypass it
[22:20:05] <kittonian> phc, "they" is Torguard support
[22:20:52] <The_8472> well, the network interface that is used to route the underlying VPN traffic still exists, so without something like network namespaces isolation can be leaky
[23:00:03] <kittonian> going to do a teamviewer session with torguard support. hopefully we'll get it figured out. thanks for the input!
