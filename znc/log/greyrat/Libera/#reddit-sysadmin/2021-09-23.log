[06:40:28] <Hunterkll> if it's only defender related files, ignore and move on
[06:40:42] <xe0n> sounds like there's an application on the box thats causing a problem... 
[06:40:42] <A-KO> damn FSA folks denied paying me my money for the surgery I had to pay out of pocket LOL
[06:40:45] <A-KO> I just called them
[06:41:02] <Hunterkll> A-KO: my HSA doesnt even require documentation anymore
[06:41:08] <Hunterkll> just "how much do you want to send to your bank kthx"
[06:41:15] <Hunterkll> i mean they can ask for it later but they just don't ask 
[06:41:16] <A-KO> they were like "the reason is that it didn't have the service information provided" and I'm like "it's right in the invoice..." and she goes "well look at that, not sure why they didn't see that. I'll get this resubmitted over with my notes."
[06:41:39] <Hunterkll> LOL
[06:41:44] <A-KO> They just didn't want to pay out nearly $2000 from my FSA for me
[06:41:45] <A-KO> that's all it is
[06:41:47] <A-KO> they're like "oh fuck"
[06:41:49] <Work-BWMerlin> So I need an install.wim file it appears
[06:41:56] <Hunterkll> why?
[06:42:01] <Hunterkll> what could DISM not fix? read that log
[06:42:09] <Hunterkll> if it's defender stuff, again, as I said, it's 100% a known issue 
[06:42:18] <JollyRgrs> what system is this for?
[06:42:20] <JollyRgrs> server?
[06:42:21] <A-KO> xe0n: never move to the US
[06:42:21] <sd> 08<a​wlnx> I'm convinced they do that shit on purpose and hope you let it go
[06:42:24] <Work-BWMerlin> That link you gave me as the error down the bottom
[06:42:24] <JollyRgrs> would it be faster to just rebuild it?
[06:42:28] <A-KO> awlnx: yeah no I don't let that shit go lol
[06:42:33] <Hunterkll> hah
[06:42:36] <Hunterkll> I hate FSAs 
[06:42:38] <Hunterkll> like what's the point
[06:42:42] <Hunterkll> HSAs are where the jam is
[06:42:42] <Work-BWMerlin> If these commands fail and generate an error message that resembles "File not found," make sure that the Install.wim file is accessible, and then run the following commands:
[06:42:55] <A-KO> I would prefer an HSA but that requires a high deductible healthcare plan, which I'm not on
[06:42:58] <A-KO> so FSA it is
[06:43:11] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: ah yes
[06:43:27] <A-KO> anyways this is burning through my 2020 and 2021 FSAs lol
[06:43:31] <A-KO> and they're probably salty about it
[06:43:42] <xe0n> you're trying to repair windows when it probably isn't windows thats the problem
[06:43:42] <A-KO> Nice thing about covid is they let everyone carry over their 2020 FSAs into 2021
[06:43:50] <Hunterkll> Work-BWMerlin: install.wim is on the 2019 iso 
[06:43:57] <Work-BWMerlin> And it looks like head office has taken down the link for server 2016
[06:44:02] <A-KO> so it's using the remainder of my 2020 FSA and like 1/2 of my remaining 2021 FSA
[06:44:04] <A-KO> they be salty
[06:44:14] <Work-BWMerlin> The server is 2016, can I use a newer install.wim?
[06:44:21] <Hunterkll> oh 
[06:44:21] <xe0n> ....
[06:44:24] <Hunterkll> you said 2019 above.....
[06:44:25] <xe0n> lol

[06:44:51] <sd> 08<a​wlnx> You should be able to get an eval copy of 2016
[06:45:00] <Hunterkll> no, you need a matching (and hopefully updated to the same patch level) install.wim as the OS version you're talking
[06:45:04] <A-KO> awlnx: Due to the timing I needed to pay this, I dumped this on a credit card to get me through the surgery
[06:45:31] <A-KO> you can get the CU and SSUs and DISM them into the install.wim
[06:45:32] <A-KO> and then use that
[06:45:34] <Work-BWMerlin> I did say 2019 even thought I clearly read 2016, my mistake.
[06:46:06] <Hunterkll> still, either way

[06:46:19] <Hunterkll> since this issue *doesn't* cause any performance concerns or errors

[06:49:23] <A-KO> Work-BWMerlin: yeah 'Murica healthcare is.....special
[06:49:49] <A-KO> the worst part isn't so much the cost if you manage your expenses right. The worst part is the fact that you have to be the fucking intermediary between all of these different groups
[06:50:00] <Hunterkll> thanks WW2 !
[06:50:12] <A-KO> they bill insurance, and whatever insurance doesn't pay they send to you. Sometimes they fuck up--and it's on you to see that and fix it.
[06:50:13] <Hunterkll> American healthcare system is literally a direct result of WW2 policies 
[06:50:23] <Hunterkll> Europe got to rebuild all their shit from the ground up 
[06:50:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[06:50:31] <A-KO> So that's the worst part
[06:50:36] <A-KO> is having to mediate where all of this money is going
[06:50:46] <A-KO> I'm like--we literally live in the digital age. Can you all not just do this automatically?

[06:52:39] <A-KO> awlnx: yeah that's pretty much how it goes. It's stupid.
[06:52:55] <Work-BWMerlin> When I had my wisdom teeth our and appendix out each time I took two weeks off on full sick pay
[06:52:55] <A-KO> I've burned through my sick days this year though. It's been dumb.
[06:53:14] <A-KO> I might be able to take short term disability for this actually...I wonder
[06:53:25] <xe0n> two weeks for wisdom teeth
[06:53:25] <xe0n> LOL
[06:53:42] <Hunterkll> A-KO: STD is usually reduced pay though
[06:54:08] <Hunterkll> yea i have.... 171 hours banked right now, and 32 holiday hours for the remaining year's holidays 
[06:54:17] <Work-BWMerlin> xe0n I had the leave, why not use it?
[06:54:18] <A-KO> yeah but I don't want to burn vacation though :/
[06:54:25] <A-KO> I'd have to look at how much I have
[06:54:28] <A-KO> 4 days of vacation is a lot :(
[06:54:34] <A-KO> especially if I want to fly back east for the holidays
[06:54:44] <Hunterkll> yea somethin to think about i guess 
[06:54:44] <xe0n> use sick leave, sure, but 2 weeks lol!
[06:54:51] <xe0n> for wisdom teeth
[06:54:59] <A-KO> I really only expect to be out 4 days

[06:55:43] <A-KO> okay time to go play some video games and chill on the couch.
[06:55:45] <xe0n> tender sure, but i was fine...
[06:55:52] <Work-BWMerlin> I think it was two weeks, might not have been because I went back and was still swollen
[06:55:55] <Work-BWMerlin> Appendix was two
[06:56:01] <A-KO> appendix 2 weeks? shit man
[06:56:02] <JollyRgrs> i did mine over spring break (1 week) when i was 16 (wisdom teeth)
[06:56:08] <A-KO> I'm expecting to be back to work on Monday
[06:56:09] <A-KO> hahaha
[06:56:13] <A-KO> it all depends on how I feel
[06:56:22] <Hunterkll> xe0n: see it's like government spending
[06:56:29] <Hunterkll> if you give people 2 week benefits, but they only use 2 days
[06:56:29] <JollyRgrs> watched jackie chan's first strike on VHS and ate ramen :D
[06:56:33] <Hunterkll> eventually they'll reduce it to 2 days 
[06:56:42] <Hunterkll> so the more people who max it out the better
[06:56:49] <Work-BWMerlin> I had been at that work place for years, I had so much sick leave might as well use it for times when I was sick
[06:57:09] <Work-BWMerlin> The best bit was when I changed my out of office
[06:57:12] <xe0n> sure
[06:57:21] <Work-BWMerlin> Said I was unavailable, contact helpdesk
[06:57:28] <Hunterkll> xe0n: shit id take a week for a broken finger LOL
[06:58:00] <Hunterkll> i took 2 days when i broke my leg for surgery and was back in office otherwise.........
[06:58:02] <Work-BWMerlin> Was told I needed to change it, so I put in that I was recovering from emergency life threatening surgery and would be unavailable.
[06:58:04] <Hunterkll> time off is expensive here

[08:15:03] <dragonfleas> i've already used up my trial on my FFXIV account
[08:15:08] <dragonfleas> i wanna play it on my ps5 though
[08:15:13] <dragonfleas> maybe i should buy subscription and try it out
[08:15:18] <Hunterkll> FFXIV + first expansion are free to play.....
[08:15:29] <dragonfleas> it doesn't let me log into my account on my ps5
[08:15:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:15:37] <dragonfleas> it says "you can't log in if there's already an active trial on this account"
[08:15:41] <dragonfleas> or something of the sort
[08:15:43] <dragonfleas> it's weird as fuck
[08:15:55] <Hunterkll> each platform is licensed separately
[08:15:57] <Hunterkll> unfortunately
[08:16:00] <dragonfleas> OH
[08:16:01] <Hunterkll> i had to buy mac + PS + windows licenses
[08:16:02] <Hunterkll> for each
[08:16:02] <dragonfleas> that's what it is
[08:16:10] <dragonfleas> so i have to make a new account for ps?
[08:16:14] <Hunterkll> it's not like FFXI where it was just one sub 
[08:16:15] <Hunterkll> basically
[08:16:18] <Hunterkll> or just buy the damn game
[08:16:18] <dragonfleas> dang
[08:16:33] <dragonfleas> i wanna see if it's worth it with controller/ps5 performance
[08:16:48] <dragonfleas> i need a good game to relax in the living room and play
[08:16:54] <Hunterkll> i honestly don't understand how controller players do it
[08:16:58] <xe0n> i wanna get the black ps5 controller
[08:17:04] <dragonfleas> i've heard it's really controller friendly
[08:17:08] <dragonfleas> but i haven't tried it yet
[08:17:30] <dragonfleas> xe0n, the ps5 controller is great with steam big picture, it has awesome support
[08:17:41] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: i'm so mad, i waited for a while b/c i didn't want white... but my PS4 controller charger port was dookie... like 1 mo. after i got the white controller... black one came out
[08:17:50] <JollyRgrs> dragonfleas: noooooooooooooooooooooope
[08:17:55] <JollyRgrs> so much input lag
[08:17:58] <xe0n> white is just ugh
[08:17:59] <dragonfleas> really???
[08:17:59] <JollyRgrs> maybe that's why you can't git gud at RL
[08:18:12] <dragonfleas> i play RL with mouse and keyboard...:(
[08:18:41] <JollyRgrs> yeah, try  doing your quick chats (like hitting up twice for gg, etc.)... you'll find it not hitting so much b/c it didn't take your 2nd hit, or your flips will be delayed or not at all and just a single jump instead
[08:18:49] <JollyRgrs> lol... that's maybe your problem :P
[08:18:59] <dragonfleas> i mean if there are KB+M pros then it's possible
[08:19:06] <JollyRgrs> i mean kudos if you can do that... i think there's only 1 (MAAAAYBE 2) pros who KBM in RL
[08:19:23] <dragonfleas> maybe there's bad input lag with PC PS5 controller on certain games but I haven't had any trouble using it for dark souls and such
[08:19:55] <JollyRgrs> RL requires pretty near perfect timing for best results, most other games you wouldn't notice it
[08:20:17] <xe0n> RL is gold tier gaming
[08:20:22] <JollyRgrs> but tbh, ds4windows (you gotta get the right version, not the old unmaintained one) works real well

[08:21:40] <dragonfleas> i like RL because it truly is a team game
[08:21:43] <xe0n> i didnt like how on ps5 the mic wasnt muted by default
[08:21:44] <xe0n> and was on

[08:22:58] <xe0n> i am still pissed off that my RL score was wiped when I logged in on ps from xbox

[08:23:15] <xe0n> me: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
[08:23:16] <dragonfleas> i hate how they somehow re-released season 1 lol
[08:23:26] <dragonfleas> now there's two season 1's and 2's etc etc
[08:23:34] <xe0n> cash money
[08:24:05] <JollyRgrs> somehow?
[08:24:06] <dragonfleas> my linode because i'm a baller https://gyazo.com/5dc045062d138a2ceb110fc2847c5f00
[08:24:12] <JollyRgrs> nah, it's not "season 1", it was "s1"
[08:24:16] <JollyRgrs> lol
[08:24:19] <dragonfleas> why did i say somehow
[08:24:28] <dragonfleas> it's late
[08:24:35] <dragonfleas> it's just weird that they did that, it's confusing
[08:24:41] <dragonfleas> because s1 was a LONG time ago
[08:24:41] <JollyRgrs> no... makes sense
[08:24:44] <JollyRgrs> i didn't like it but...
[08:24:51] <JollyRgrs> it was for the free to play kickoff
[08:25:00] <dragonfleas> i guess that makes sense for the new wave of players
[08:25:03] <dragonfleas> a refresh of the game
[08:25:05] <JollyRgrs> all those epic weenies will like starting at s1
[08:25:06] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[08:25:19] <dragonfleas> i bought the game...season 8 i think?
[08:25:26] <JollyRgrs> so you notice it's like "season 1" through "season 14" and then "s1" (not season 1 again)
[08:25:30] <JollyRgrs> I never bought it
[08:25:40] <JollyRgrs> but someone gifted it to me (someone who used to be in here) back in season 1
[08:26:33] <JollyRgrs> i did buy it on the switch b/c i thought it'd be fun to have when i go on vacation or had to travel for work or something
[08:26:40] <JollyRgrs> then i learned RL on the switch is sooooooo awful
[08:27:20] <dragonfleas> ah no i started S9

[11:15:35] <sd> 07<l​ayer08> 1 bedroom rent is  1400-2000
[11:15:40] <sd> 07<l​ayer08> to give an idea
[11:15:43] <Activ8> ouch
[11:15:46] <dragonfleas> some people think LA is literally all the way from like southernmost part of south pay, all the way to up over the hill lol
[11:15:54] <sd> 07<l​ayer08> LA metro spans quite a region
[11:15:56] <dragonfleas> south bay*
[11:16:04] <Activ8> a 3 bedroom to rent here in uk min is about £350 but wages are miles lower 
[11:16:22] <Activ8> a sysadmin is about 24-28K a year
[11:16:26] <not_ihre> wut
[11:16:28] <Hunterkll> like
[11:16:35] <Hunterkll> you could be in anaheim paying $2300/mo for a studio 
[11:16:44] <dragonfleas> or burbank paying 3k LUL
[11:16:47] <Hunterkll> or out in pomona putting up with gangs, open air drug dealers, and cheap rents
[11:16:47] <not_ihre> 350? just south of Edinburgh or something? 
[11:17:01] <Activ8> a studio here would be about £500-£700
[11:17:19] <Activ8> bare in mind a studio would be usually for someone who is using it for their business
[11:17:38] <sd> 07<l​ayer08> idk. please tell me if i have delusions of grandeur. i deploy, administer, and troubleshoot backups for 160+ clients. ranging from 1-2 servers to up to 20-30 servers. this involves offsite replication, disaster recovery etc etc etc
[11:17:42] <dragonfleas> bro pomona apartments are still like 1800 a month lmao
[11:17:48] <dragonfleas> 45k is literally not liveable there
[11:17:50] <xe0n> you're doing BAU work..
[11:18:07] <sd> 07<l​ayer08> i just want to not live in a 1 br apartment
[11:18:08] <xe0n> operations and probably with a mix of projects
[11:18:25] <xe0n> so its just typical MSP type stuff...so yeah BAU
[11:18:32] <Activ8> you know the best thing you can do is to get on with your role, take your money and IF an opportunity comes for more money go for an interview and take it.
[11:18:41] <Hunterkll> yea MSP work is what you do when you can't get a real job
[11:18:47] <Hunterkll> unless you go work for a big MSP 
[11:18:50] <Hunterkll> like IBM 
[11:18:53] <Activ8> don't sit and be loyal with a company they only want you for what your worth and for what you can do for the company
[11:19:02] <dragonfleas> it's generally good experience and you learn a lot, just overworked and underpaid most of the time
[11:19:06] <Hunterkll> or whoever the fuck was the one we were using in 2016 to pack and ship servers with armed guards and shit 
[11:19:26] <dragonfleas> question is layer08, why the hell would you say yes to a 45k job in LA? this your first IT gig?
[11:19:33] <sd> 07<l​ayer08> its not IN la
[11:19:46] <Activ8> Hunterkll nail head - the MSP who I work for is easy going, laid back and I work from home ALL remote.  Pay is not good but who cares I can chill.
[11:19:50] <sd> 07<l​ayer08> im just giving geographic context
[11:20:07] <dragonfleas> you said an hour outside LA, which isn't that far tbh

[11:32:36] <Activ8> damn, surface pro 8 looks appealing
[11:33:24] <Hunterkll> dragonfleas: though, the author's overarching conclusion across all books is really 'jesus never existed as a person' 
[11:33:32] <Hunterkll> but the way and information is presented basically leaves you 
[11:33:33] <dragonfleas> yeah i agree with that sentiment
[11:33:44] <dragonfleas> i'm pretty sure jesus didn't actually exist
[11:33:44] <Hunterkll> "well now i know more, i can make more educated thoughts about it"
[11:34:00] <dragonfleas> there's no historical record of him except for like ONE other book, that's debated to even be legit or not and widely regarded as fake
[11:34:06] <Hunterkll> it's not a "and here we prove jesus never existed with this handwavy bullshit" type stuff
[11:34:41] <Hunterkll> more a shitload of just hard facts, citations to a ton of other researchers, and whatnot 
[11:34:44] <dragonfleas> you'd think some miracle man going around doing amazing and insane things more people would have enscribed shit about him

[11:57:13] <DrZak> oh
[11:57:15] <A-KO> DrZak: check your ram
[11:57:16] <A-KO> seriously
[11:57:19] <A-KO> this shit is picky as fuck with ram
[11:57:22] <A-KO> if it's not on the compat list don't use it
[11:57:24] <DrZak> check as in - timing
[11:57:29] <DrZak> oh
[11:57:36] <A-KO> no, as in look on the motherboard compat list--in the exact configuration they say
[11:57:38] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess Yoshi P is a pretty down to earth and player connected guy - he actually actively still plays the game (and XI!) himself 
[11:57:43] <DrZak> well i already got 64gb , i am not gonna dump that
[11:57:56] <DrZak> hmm
[11:58:01] <DrZak> ok, let me take a look
[11:58:02] <A-KO> DrZak: For example. I have RAM sticks. The sets work individually ; but if I put both sets in for all 4 sticks? It's unstable as fuck.
[11:58:04] <Hunterkll> like I suspect there will be changes to the tele fee increase and new tele system before launch and thats just under 2 mo nths away 
[11:58:11] <DrZak> o.0
[11:58:19] <A-KO> they're the same model of RAM, one's single rank and one's dual rank.
[11:58:27] <Hunterkll> so they're not the same model
[11:58:31] <Hunterkll> They're -001 and -002 :

[11:59:04] <A-KO> AMD's X570 is picky as fuck on RAM configuration
[11:59:05] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess ah this is a lot more organized and shit, but yea 
[11:59:10] <sd> 11<H​otmess> warframe devs play disterbing amounts of their games
[11:59:10] <A-KO> if it's not validated at 4 sticks, it's shitty
[11:59:29] <sd> 11<H​otmess> warframe is tvma so their streams are aimed at 18+
[11:59:36] <A-KO> DrZak: *ALL* of my stability problems went away when I took out 2 of the sticks. I tested them in all possible configurations. And looked on the MB compat list? The only non-supported config was all 4 sticks
[11:59:48] <sd> 11<H​otmess> end of year stream is the lead devs getting boozed up
[11:59:55] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess they dont do shit like that, but like yea, they add shit in response to player needs/wants and make it balance too, so 
[11:59:59] <A-KO> I mem tested all 4 slots, mixed and matched the sticks, mixed and matched the slots. From 1 stick, to 2 sticks.
[12:00:03] <A-KO> And the only failures I had were all 4 sticks
[12:00:05] <A-KO> in either configuration
[12:00:12] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess not like WoW even in the early days where it was just ignore everyone, do what we want
[12:00:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> yeah

[12:08:52] <Hunterkll> it's a bit EVE like in how it handles load

[12:09:03] <Hunterkll> and you can walk end to end

[12:09:17] <sd> 11<H​otmess> yeah but tbh it kinda pissed me of a bit
[12:09:29] <sd> 11<H​otmess> its a bit to ff7 for me to call it a mmo

[12:34:53] <sd> 11<H​otmess> Legendary armour lets you transmute and  stat change for free out of combat. It's only 0.5% better stats than the lower set of gear
[12:35:16] <sd> 11<H​otmess> Tansmute is change appeance
[12:35:42] <Hunterkll> a lot of gear you can "meld" materia to it to enhance the stats
[12:36:09] <Hunterkll> but theres a max of 5 to each item, and effectiveness is capped for different attribute categories, and past the defined standard slots there's a high chance of the materia being destoryed instead of applying
[12:36:09] <sd> 11<H​otmess> Yeah imagion that but at will
[12:36:40] <Hunterkll> i think for my Aesthet crafting gear one run I lost 37 materia before a successful application lol
[12:36:55] <sd> 11<H​otmess> The intent is the Devs have made you play the game enough to no longer have you worry about gear :)
[12:37:08] <sd> 11<H​otmess> Lol
[12:37:25] <Hunterkll> 50/60/70/80 if you're just playing dungeons, you can go to an NPC and exchange the scrip/tomestones you earn for gear for that level
[12:37:36] <Hunterkll> which is "good enough" that you're not a hinderence or have difficulty in the standard storyline content

[12:48:55] <A-KO> but beyond that, it's not really that functional IMO
[12:49:07] <A-KO> I mean, people do functional things in it--but it's not the only way to do those functional things
[12:49:16] <A-KO> unless the game of course is designed around that
[12:49:43] <Hunterkll> "functional"
[12:49:47] <Hunterkll> I think you mean "fucktional"

[14:50:35] <riff-IRC> awmv: Leave the NIC drivers uninstalled
[14:51:03] <awmv> riff-IRC: Wait, what?
[14:52:46] <riff-IRC> (i'm joking)
[15:08:40] <DrZak> what kind of automation server?
[15:08:46] <DrZak> i mean, you have it setup local
[15:09:14] <DrZak> or you pick up a product that can somehow use http and rest, so nothing from outside connects IN but stuff from inside connects OUT
[15:10:01] <DrZak> then, wait for the unusual product break down after the little development company crashes/the pfy in the basement dies of autoerotic asphyxia
[15:10:04] <DrZak> and cry a lot

[15:11:04] <DrZak> yea
[15:11:13] <DrZak> i really really love little custom 'apps'
[15:11:36] <DrZak> even more if they are shiny, and there are many gender and race appropriate mannequins in the pictures

[15:46:31] <csws> sintax, what switches are you using?
[15:47:18] <sintax> I have a UDM-Pro with internet connected through sfp+ to it. Then to a QNAP 2.5/10gbit managed switch. But it all is going to tie in to a dell power connect 10gbit backbone switch
[15:47:34] <sintax> the dell scares me. i've never been in a cli only switch.
[15:47:45] <csws> lol
[15:47:46] <sintax> i'm comfortable in a linux cli. so i'm sure i'll be fine. 
[15:47:50] <csws> I think the thing that should terrify you is the fan noise
[15:48:06] <sintax> nah. they're in a 42 cabinet with sides and doors.
[15:48:14] <sintax> only one server is on and i'm selling the other 3
[15:48:37] <csws> for what it's worth I can recommend mikrotik stuff
[15:48:39] <sintax> two dell r715's with 256gb ram each and then a supermicro with 384ish gb ram
[15:48:45] <sintax> yeah I looked at them.
[15:48:52] <csws> you can get a brand new 10gbe SFP+ switch for pretty cheap and they're fanless
[15:48:54] <thegodsquirrel> Dell cli isn't too bad just watch those running / startup configs lol

[15:49:12] <sintax> csws: yeah but i didn't pay for those
[15:49:18] <sintax> free from work. I wanted the ram. 
[15:49:22] <sintax> that's what will sell them :)
[15:49:41] <csws> maybe one day the r715 will be a museum piece
[15:49:43] <csws> as they're kinda rare lol
[15:49:45] <sintax> also when i got my rack i got two apc 208 volt managed pdu's
[15:49:51] <sintax> csws: lol
[15:50:04] <sintax> gonna sell them too. new they're over $800
[15:50:23] <csws> yeah good managed PDUs are expensive
[15:50:35] <sintax> i'm gonna list them starting at $150
[15:50:37] <csws> I got 2 8 port APC ones that are real cheap
[15:50:41] <sintax> nice.
[15:50:43] <csws> but it's like I pulled them out of a time machine
[15:50:46] <thegodsquirrel> Next homeprod server will be 2U
[15:50:50] <csws> seriously one is so old it doesn't even support DHCP. I had to enable BOOTP
[15:50:55] <sintax> lol
[15:51:09] <csws> both of them had creds on them, had to use some old chinese factory backdoor to reset them
[15:51:16] <sintax> i just want the cash and get one nice server i can virtualize on
[15:51:17] <Hunterkll> thegodsquirrel: 2U disk shelf, 4U disk shelf, 2U server
[15:51:19] <Hunterkll> best way 
[15:51:29] <sintax> I have a 4u supermicro
[15:51:32] <Hunterkll> csws: BOOTP is still used today........
[15:51:55] <sintax> i dont' even know what BOOTP is haha
[15:52:03] <Hunterkll> ...........
[15:52:08] <sintax> ...
[15:52:29] <sintax> never had to use it before
[15:52:39] <sintax> plus networking is my weak spot and I know it. 
[15:52:44] <Hunterkll> sintax: god help you if you ever encounter RARP
[15:52:45] <csws> well DHCP apparently first became a thing in '93 and that particular PDU is from '96 so it might've just been fashionable to still make BOOTP only devices
[15:52:47] <sintax> hence why i' upgrading my home network to play on

[15:52:59] <thegodsquirrel> Hunterkll I don't that much storage space, but heck yea!

[15:53:25] <csws> but yeah the backdoor password is TENmanUFactOryPOWER lol
[15:53:33] <thegodsquirrel> bwahaha, someone is plexing it up I imagine
[15:53:34] <csws> you login with that and it gives you all these weird options for factory QA
[15:53:38] <Hunterkll> will have half a petabyte in the 4U disk shelf eventually

[17:04:20] <AnonymooseReddtr> not really sure what the app is but hosting legacy client/server apps in the cloud is dumb

[17:07:15] <AnonymooseReddtr> medical billing right?
[17:07:19] <sd> 12<S​obia> Yessir. There's a 5 user licenses minimum unless you are going with Enterprise licensing. We are an MSP so... We are looking at documentation options.

[17:07:24] <PublicWiFi> so the software picks are almost null
[17:07:34] <AnonymooseReddtr> is it an actual EMS suite or just billing/accounting system?

[17:08:22] <PublicWiFi> EMS billing
[17:08:26] <AnonymooseReddtr> right

[17:09:02] <PublicWiFi> aka my bosses haha
[17:09:09] <PublicWiFi> like
[17:09:17] <PublicWiFi> instead of patient data, yo  have patient data and 
[17:09:21] <PublicWiFi> "run" info
[17:09:23] <AnonymooseReddtr> right 
[17:09:25] <estranger> it's a clusterfuck that takes specific domain knowledge that's always changing
[17:09:41] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> if only there was a better way...
[17:09:43] <PublicWiFi> milage, what they did, who was involved, insurance, all kinds of shit
[17:09:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> So patient Y had procedure X and we bill them $Y
[17:09:47] <PublicWiFi> just a total different subset of data
[17:10:06] <PublicWiFi> and so medical billing software companies aren't keen on offering something they'd have to totally overhaul I guess
[17:10:08] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> you can't really bill based on procedure because it has to have a DSM code

[17:11:48] <PublicWiFi> not sure about fhir tbh
[17:11:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> estranger I worked for a dynamics var before 
[17:11:51] <estranger> PublicWiFi it's a data format standard for HIPAA/patient data
[17:11:52] <AnonymooseReddtr> :D
[17:11:54] <AnonymooseReddtr> so no shill
[17:12:03] <PublicWiFi> estranger: we might I jsut don't know for sure the backend details
[17:12:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> anyway 
[17:12:11] <PublicWiFi> we use standards like NEMSIS and ESO
[17:12:14] <estranger> PublicWiFi lol Kafka shillin yo
[17:12:22] <PublicWiFi> but im not keen on the details of it
[17:12:37] <PublicWiFi> but a 24 hour fucking outage for our core software is unacceptable lol
[17:12:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> nothing about this sounds unique to medical billing
[17:12:50] <PublicWiFi> if i was smarter I would build this software and sell it
[17:12:52] <PublicWiFi> and get fucking rich
[17:12:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> i know nothing about it lol 
[17:13:03] <PublicWiFi> there's so many small EMS billers that use the same softwaer we do currently
[17:13:12] <PublicWiFi> basically there's 2 groups
[17:13:18] <PublicWiFi> small billers who use this software
[17:13:24] <PublicWiFi> or huge ones that outgrew it and built their own internally
[17:13:32] <AnonymooseReddtr> yea
[17:13:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> so @ old job we had one company that was a billing firm for public utility companies
[17:13:43] <PublicWiFi> we're getting close to the latter side
[17:13:49] <estranger> AnonymooseReddtr it's just all the rules and 3rd party hookin requirements
[17:13:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> estranger yeah that makes a lot of sense 
[17:14:08] <AnonymooseReddtr> but the "3rd party" requirements are surely mostly built around EDI standards
[17:14:09] <AnonymooseReddtr> i would hope
[17:14:51] <PublicWiFi> i haven't used dynamics in so long
[17:14:54] <AnonymooseReddtr> If it were me PublicWiFi? you pick a Tier 1 SaaS app (SAP/NetSuite/Dynamics Finance & Operations)   and you build a custom integration for it
[17:14:58] <PublicWiFi> how's the hotkeys in it? lmfao
[17:15:06] <AnonymooseReddtr> you sell the damn integration as an app
[17:15:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> hotkeys?

[17:17:32] <PublicWiFi> there's a LOT that goes into it
[17:17:37] <AnonymooseReddtr> probably
[17:17:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> it won't be cheap
[17:17:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> to implement
[17:17:48] <PublicWiFi> we pay a good chunk now
[17:17:52] <estranger> a free azure consult? I'm sure yes
[17:17:58] <AnonymooseReddtr> free consult i'm sure 
[17:18:10] <estranger> msft pre sales is huge
[17:18:15] <PublicWiFi> we pay roughly 60k per year
[17:18:18] <PublicWiFi> for this shit ass software
[17:18:21] <AnonymooseReddtr> and D365 on the cloud is solid as hell 
[17:18:24] <AnonymooseReddtr> right
[17:18:25] <PublicWiFi> that with user licenses n shit
[17:18:33] <estranger> :x
[17:18:38] <AnonymooseReddtr> you would definitely pay a pretty penny for licensing and the implementation
[17:18:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> but 
[17:18:55] <estranger> a lot more than 60k
[17:18:56] <PublicWiFi> so you think its comparable to 60k? lol
[17:18:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> in theory you could partner with a Dynamics partner design the app and let them sell the integration 
[17:18:58] <PublicWiFi> fuck
[17:19:00] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[17:19:09] <AnonymooseReddtr> estranger uhm, licensing no
[17:19:16] <AnonymooseReddtr> implementation costs? yes
[17:19:18] <PublicWiFi> so you mean
[17:19:21] <PublicWiFi> 1 huge up front cost
[17:19:25] <PublicWiFi> then licensing after ofc
[17:19:27] <estranger> I would guess the tco will be a lot more
[17:19:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> yes
[17:19:33] <Sousapro> Remember to alias nano='vim' on all of your Prod systems
[17:19:34] <AnonymooseReddtr> estranger probably 
[17:19:39] <PublicWiFi> how is dynamics usually licensed? per user?
[17:19:42] <PublicWiFi> or per server?
[17:19:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> per user yes
[17:19:44] <PublicWiFi> both?
[17:19:48] <PublicWiFi> of 365 makes sense that way duh
[17:19:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> I wouldn't encourage you to go looking to host this on prem
[17:20:04] <AnonymooseReddtr> it CAN be done but its fucking beast
[17:20:12] <PublicWiFi> im fine with cloud if it sticks to the SLA

[18:34:28] <iphone> she lost herself in it. Once she got addicted, she started selling all her stuff to maintain her habit. Once she ran out of things to sell, she started to steal from our grandma (her mom). She stole $3000 in cash and all her jewelry, including her engagement ring which was passed down two generations. Once she had nothing else to steal and no family to take her in, she hit the streets and
[18:34:31] <iphone> had to find.... other ways to get her fix. This is when she started injecting the weed. She ended up overdosing behind a walmart dumpster.

[21:04:01] <A-KO> It's honestly probably because everyone's pointing to the root NC for searches
[21:04:04] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> inb4 it's the most convoluted search query ever
[21:04:07] <A-KO> much of this can be solved by just going down a level
[21:04:07] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> lmao
[21:04:13] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> yeah
[21:04:39] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> ugh i have to dive into odsee and I realllllly don't want to
[21:04:40] <A-KO> nah it's because we don't fucking delete objects. We've got an OU with like every terminated account ever. ANd I'm sure they're not using the useraccountcontrol bit to search. So they're probably getting a list of aaaaallll of those objects and just discarding them
[21:04:43] <A-KO> Probably not paginating, either.
[21:04:57] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> lmaoooo
[21:05:08] <A-KO> so if I just bump them down a level it should clear a lot of it up
[21:05:17] <A-KO> that's what I'm guessing anyway
[21:05:35] <xMopx> is logging into old reddit broken for anyone else?
[21:05:42] <A-KO> I don't think it's an indexing problem, at least perfmon didn't seem to show that
[21:05:52] <A-KO> xMopx: Reddit has been fucked for me for like 2-3 days now on the mobile app. Random shit just breaking
[21:06:23] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> imo install res on your desktop and have it switch you over to old reddit, rather than going to the domain
[21:06:37] <thegodsquirrel> Reddit seems to be operational here
[21:06:41] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> i rarely have issues
[21:06:49] <A-KO> another thing i could do is switch people to using load-balanced LDAP points
[21:06:54] <A-KO> and just round robin and spread the request load out
[21:07:04] <A-KO> so that might be something I do, too
[21:07:12] <xMopx> oh, i can login if i turn off RES
[21:07:14] <xMopx> huh
[21:07:14] <sintax> I hate end users
[21:07:24] <A-KO> sintax: I hate devlopers
[21:07:25] <A-KO> lolol
[21:07:28] <sintax> lol
[21:07:30] <thegodsquirrel> I hate humans
[21:07:43] <thegodsquirrel> down with meatspace
[21:07:47] <A-KO> damn Windows 11 is so nice right now
[21:07:52] <sintax> Dude wants me to set a desk phone number to a non existent one. like dude. it doesn't exist. I don't even know where you got this phone number from
[21:07:55] <A-KO> that said, I need to get my new CPU this weekend
[21:08:01] <A-KO> assuming I'm functional
[21:08:05] <sintax> A-KO: i've been running it at home. 
[21:08:06] <vinrock> is outlook still jacked up
[21:08:15] <A-KO> sintax: same
[21:08:17] <sintax> vinrock: is it ever not?
[21:08:21] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[21:08:23] <vinrock> trying to acess webmail and its just that stupif envelope animation non stop
[21:08:25] <vinrock> heh
[21:08:31] <sintax> A-KO: just waiting for the finished iso to drop oct 5 to get out of the dev channel
[21:08:32] <A-KO> vinrock: hmmm, no issues for me this morning?
[21:08:39] <vinrock> ok it finally opened
[21:08:43] <sintax> we have OWA turned off so it never works
[21:08:45] <AnonymooseReddtr> i want to load win11 on my work machine but not sure i want to
[21:08:52] <sintax> AnonymooseReddtr: do it
[21:08:53] <A-KO> sintax: lol. At home I'll run dev channel but at work I'll run the production release. Plan is to go production at work ASAP
[21:08:55] <sintax> i'm gonna
[21:08:59] <A-KO> and light up all security bells and whistles
[21:09:01] <sintax> A-KO:  nice
[21:09:07] <sintax> you do it
[21:09:09] <sintax> i'll do it
[21:09:12] <sintax> and see what happens
[21:09:19] <A-KO> One of the reasons I want this new CPU is due to the new security shit they've got built in
[21:09:24] <AnonymooseReddtr> ^
[21:09:39] <A-KO> 11th gen Intel and Zen 3 have some additional security tech built in that Windows 11 can use
[21:09:51] <A-KO> it's not required for running 11 like a TPM is; but if it's there it'll use it
[21:09:55] <A-KO> AMD calls it "shadow stack"
[21:10:16] <sintax> brb
[21:10:34] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> i gotta buy a fuckin tpm card if I want to run 11, and I'm very much not about doing that
[21:10:38] <A-KO> in the windows security tool under "Device Security" at the bottom it'll say something like "Your device meets the requirements of enhanced hardware security"
[21:10:41] <A-KO> you should
[21:10:43] <A-KO> TPM 2.0 is nice
[21:10:49] <A-KO> but most modern CPUs have them built in now
[21:10:51] <A-KO> so it's just enabling it in the bios
[21:11:02] <A-KO> https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-protection-in-windows-security-afa11526-de57-b1c5-599f-3a4c6a61c5e2#hardwarescore
[21:11:10] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> i honestly see no reason to upgrade to 11 outside of their, once again, new ui design lang
[21:11:15] <A-KO> Your device exceeds the requirements for enhanced hardware security (Note: In Windows 20H2 this message will say "Your device has all Secured-core PC features enabled")
[21:11:15] <A-KO> This means that in addition to meeting all the requirements of enhanced hardware security, your device also has System Management Mode (SMM) protection turned on
[21:11:18] <A-KO> ^^ This is what I want lol
[21:11:27] *** Joins: Joe-Developer (~Joe-Devel@user/joe-developer)
[21:11:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> i'm so not feeling productive today
[21:11:55] <A-KO> SMM protection is nice, but that's a modern CPU feature thing
[21:12:09] <A-KO> sadly Zen 2 does not have it :(
[21:12:34] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> im sittin on a 5800x
[21:12:42] <A-KO> uh, then you should have TPM 2.0
[21:12:44] <A-KO> it's built into the CPU
[21:12:44] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> so i've got everything but tpm
[21:12:51] <A-KO> just go turn on "fTPM" in the BIOS
[21:12:55] <A-KO> and it'll be there
[21:12:56] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> hmm
[21:12:59] <A-KO> no need to buy a separate card
[21:13:12] <A-KO> Zen 3 100% has it built in to the CPU
[21:13:17] <A-KO> my Zen 2 does, that's what I'm using
[21:13:28] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> i'll double check then, I _do_ have a "pro" asus board
[21:13:48] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> so i'd imagine the settings are there

[21:25:32] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> But the skunk smell lingered in the house for weeks
[21:25:33] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> god, that's such a horrible way to wake up too
[21:25:47] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> You'd leave and come back and be like "... yup still smells"

[22:39:46] <dragonfleas> Why do developers always feel the need to blame non-prod issues on production
[22:40:07] <dragonfleas> "our app has issues and awful memory management, so it's an emergency for you devops guys to allocate more memory on every instance, sorry we're going to bed, enjoy!"
[22:40:17] <dragonfleas> like bruh come on
[22:40:29] <dragonfleas> the developers at my org shock me honestly
[22:41:16] <dragonfleas> those are code issues, this has nothing to do with infra, test your damn code better before you have us push it to prod
[22:41:24] <dragonfleas>  /rant
[22:41:26] <iphone> you should have monitors in place to fix the issue before it becomes an issue
[22:41:31] <iphone> if you're doing devoops
[22:41:54] <dragonfleas> i mean how do you think we found out
[22:42:02] <iphone> the devs told you
[22:42:40] <sd> 02<W​ant a new job!> LOL, going to bed, thats the best.
[22:42:42] <dragonfleas> no, we saw utilization spiking, the clients saw performance degradation, we went to devs, devs said "sorry just allocate more memory ez clap"
[22:42:57] <iphone> ez clap lol
[22:43:13] <dragonfleas> even though it's very obviously a new code issue because all of our metrics point at much lower utilization overall before the date of the code push
[22:43:18] <sd> 02<W​ant a new job!> Just put more rAm in it!
[22:43:23] <dragonfleas> i hate that mentality

[23:23:35] <dragonfleas> JFAC is really good
[23:23:42] <iphone> intant classic

[23:25:53] <dragonfleas> i literally had my alarm as wake up for like 3 years
[23:26:33] <iphone> I woke up to this as my alarm cuz it starts quiet then rapes your ears https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47Plg93oJ1M

[23:26:45] <dragonfleas> holy shit

[23:27:08] <dragonfleas> did you see the tribute song that phil bozeman did with them?
[23:27:14] <iphone> yeah bud
[23:27:23] <dragonfleas> love phil bozeman, dude is such a kind soul
[23:27:28] <dragonfleas> i talked to him on omegle years ago
[23:27:30] <iphone> no hes a fucking demon
[23:27:41] <dragonfleas> hahahaa he's actually a really nice guy
[23:27:47] <dragonfleas> but his vocals are demonic
[23:28:23] <thegodsquirrel> Cannibal Corpse is good as well
[23:28:27] <iphone> he pioneered that thing where he starts his syllables high and finishes them low, so he sounds like hyuh hyuh 
[23:28:29] <dragonfleas> oh that's old school lol
[23:28:33] <gibby> hammer smashed face is bae
[23:28:36] <dragonfleas> hammer smashed face is fucking baller
[23:28:40] <dragonfleas> AYYY gibby
[23:28:43] <gibby> -_-
[23:28:57] <iphone> I like the newer cannible corpse stuff
[23:29:10] <iphone> though 6 feet under with the original vocalist of cannibal corpse is great too
[23:29:54] <iphone> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53knsmbjY8Q is great by six feet under
[23:31:36] <thegodsquirrel> Acacia Strain is hard as hell
[23:32:14] <dragonfleas> ya'll remember 7861 by beneath the sky
[23:32:24] <iphone> never heard of them
[23:32:30] <dragonfleas> ooooh they're old school
[23:33:39] <iphone> I like that the bass is actually audible
[23:34:06] <dragonfleas> i know so many people's bank pins because of this song
[23:34:27] <dragonfleas> basically if you know someone who's a deathcore kid, try that as their pin and you've successfully hacked them LOL
[23:36:55] <thegodsquirrel> Deathcore scene kidnapping and murder up by 50 percent...
[23:37:18] <iphone> they sound a lot like suicide silence
[23:38:04] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> wtf is a 303 HTTP status?
[23:38:11] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> or rather, what is it used for?
[23:38:36] <dragonfleas> It's saying it's somewhere else
[23:38:36] <iphone> looks like its a redirect after a POST
[23:38:39] <dragonfleas> kind of like the moved status
[23:39:00] <iphone> so if you submit a form, and get redirected back to the home page, its probably a 303
[23:39:42] <iphone> 301/302 indicate that the resource is somewhere else, but 303 seems like its redirecting you somewhere else because you don't need to be on that page anymore
[23:39:44] <thegodsquirrel> Man another good band...

[23:40:26] <dragonfleas> given it did say "Hail satan motherfucker" on it
