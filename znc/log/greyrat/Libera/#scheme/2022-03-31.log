[00:41:32] <Franciman> aeth: does r7rs have a json parser?

[00:47:40] <amazigh> my rationale outside social pressure is: R7RS should offer guidelines on what is in, and what is out, such as: a) that is a common case, b) that is schemey c) that is handy d) that is generic enough
[00:47:56] <amazigh> but SRFI-180 is trying to solve a problem nobody has (or should have)
[00:48:18] <amazigh> in the spirit of side-effect-poisoning
[00:48:26] <amazigh> who read bigger than RAM JSON?!
[00:48:54] <dpk> ah, i see you've become a member of the Your Dataset Fits In Memory Party
[00:49:32] <dpk> you can get people to hire you as a Big Data consultant and charge them unreasonable amounts per hour for you to tell them that 1TB of RAM is actually quite cheap
[00:49:52] <amazigh> another example, but some may disagree, converting to ad-hoc records in one pass... is early optimization.
[00:50:04] <amazigh> dpk: true story
[00:50:48] <dpk> (actually, may not be as cheap as it was when i first heard that joke, because of microchip shortage etc)
[00:51:30] <amazigh> Someone on #lisp told me they use RAM for all their dataset, and they have a database...
[00:51:41] <amazigh> MongoDB too
[00:51:56] <amazigh> but JSON is not the tool for those usecase
[00:52:14] <dpk> i was going to ask if it was ITA Software, but i don't think they'd be caught dead within ten miles of MongoDB
[00:52:27] <dpk> (they're probably deeply tied to the Googlestack these days anyway)
[00:52:49] <amazigh> it is not ITA, but a company dedicated in RDF / semantic databases
[00:52:54] <ChoHag> Nothing wrong with RAM for a backing store.
[00:53:02] <ChoHag> Telcos do it.
[00:53:09] <amazigh> yes and no :) it depends on your use case.
[00:53:43] <aeth> consider video games because they're an interesting exception to how things are usually structured
[00:53:54] <aeth> not unusual to have all of the world state in RAM except when periodically saving
[00:54:17] <amazigh> their database is TBs
[00:54:26] <amazigh> not a regular game database
[00:55:05] <aeth> well, yeah, a game has to fit in 8-16 GB of RAM as you have to write to the normal minimum spec of your users' machines... and you need spare RAM to load massive graphical assets just to unload them once the GPU gets them
[00:55:10] <amazigh> but I know expert of games, I guess it is a normal consumer game
[01:03:35] <ChoHag> Games these days are enormous.
[01:04:03] <ChoHag> Somehow Microsoft and their allies have managed to bloat Doom to a GB or so.
[01:04:52] <ChoHag> The average download I see going through an Xbox these days is never measured in less than 10s of gigabytes. 100+ is extremely common.
[01:05:22] <ChoHag> I honestly have no idea what they're putting in there.
[01:07:40] <ChoHag> But I'm pleased to see that SimSysAdmin is being built in to all gaming devices these days. That game's given me much joy (money) throughout my life so I'm glad the general masses can also have so much fun. Whether they like it or not.
[01:07:43] <amazigh> they put textures for various resolutions
[01:08:10] <aeth> ChoHag: games are enormous, yes, but that's mostly just things like textures, which are loaded into VRAM on the graphics card for the GPU
[01:08:33] *** Joins: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199)
[01:08:46] <ChoHag> I'm sorry but when Doom is being measured in gigabytes we have a problem.
[01:08:50] <aeth> ChoHag: the actual world state in modern games might be simpler than old video games... for instance, I've noticed a lot of the time, all of the props on a level are "glued", while the '00s experimented with physics props and maybe even fully destructable environments
[01:09:18] <aeth> compare Counter-Strike: Source's cs_office with CS:GO's cs_office
[01:09:32] <aeth> the latter, newer, game glues all of the props for performance and so you can't push them around for a competitive advantage
[01:09:42] <aeth> in the former game, you could shoot shelves and stuff
[01:10:26] <ChoHag> From what I see --- I don't play much --- game designers a floundering with little clue what to do with the technology.
[01:10:40] <aeth> (Counter-Strike is a good example of the evolution of games over time because it just continually remakes its old, late-90s maps. Most franchises go for new content in new releases.)
[01:10:41] <ChoHag> Many games seem to be basically rogue++.
[01:11:55] <ChoHag> Rub an FPS on it.
[01:11:57] <aeth> ChoHag: it's because the main thing that has improved over the past 15 years is the GPU
[01:12:09] <aeth> so the main thing that games have done over the past 15 years is improve the graphics
[01:12:17] <aeth> it really follows hardware
[01:12:54] <aeth> The only place where games have to experiment right now is VR

[01:14:44] <ChoHag> Games could begin to take advantage of machine learning.
[01:14:59] <aeth> You can see this with the Steam Deck. Turn down the graphics (sometimes not even that) and target 800p (the 16:10 version of the 16:9 720p) instead of 4k and you get to play brand new games on a handheld in 15W
[01:15:19] <aeth> So games really, really haven't done anything but up the graphics and up the resolution and framerate
[01:15:37] <aeth> Otherwise you couldn't play new games on what's effectively the equivalent of 8 year old hardware (the Steam Deck)

[01:22:14] <aeth> but even that isn't really unrecognizable, they'd probably just go "everyone copied Zynga???"

[08:11:15] <mdhughes> But my point is, you don't pull in an entire game world to RAM, just the parts you absolutely have to have. If you travel between zones, you fake the edges of the neighbor zone and teleport the player over when they go inside.

[09:56:57] <aeth> only the graphics card cares about the visual stuff
[10:00:29] <aeth> Afaik, you can have a 3D action game (FPS or third person) that has basically no difference between 2004 and now except for the textures and shaders... I'm guessing Doom Eternal falls in that category. Some games try to have very open worlds or tons of enemies or whatever.
[10:01:15] <aeth> Definitely doable to write something like this in Scheme because even if it's 5x slower than C, nobody's going to notice because the GPU does everything. Contrast with, say, Factorio. There the CPU does everything.
[10:07:04] <aeth> Very counterintuitive when you think about it because Doom Eternal looks more impressive, visually, but that's all on the GPU.

[11:39:06] <mdhughes> The issue is the amount of content you're pushing thru, and keeping in memory. The GPU has to be loaded from your main RAM, and modern models have massively more data than they used to.

[19:25:10] <amazigh> I am gathering ideas about a revision of the 'hyper' http server at https://hyper.dev/n/compendium-of-web-patterns/ 
[19:25:13] <amazigh> change log: a) drop support for bigger than memory http response, b) support both html5, and json c) expose HTTP headers to the `proc` handler, and accept HTTP headers in response
[19:25:36] <amazigh> previous hyper http server was meant to support only single page application aka. REST APIs.
[19:26:42] <amazigh> now it support both one page per HTTP request, where the frontend HTML is rendered by the backend, and JSON over HTTP aka. REST API.
[19:28:08] <gwatt> dTal: the reason that's not optimized is that you're using let. You need to use let* or letrec
[19:28:53] <dTal> yeah I noticed - I also had an old version of g in my repl that made it not die
[19:29:12] <dTal> there was some good discussion in #lisp about it
[19:29:12] <amazigh> how do you check what it is compiled to?
[19:29:43] <amazigh> do you pass through `expand` or look at the generated assembly? maybe there is something in between?
[19:29:59] <gwatt> expand/optimize
[19:30:18] <dTal> you can also tell the difference just with (time)
[19:30:36] <dTal> since the nested function version allocates, and the inlined version doesn't
[19:31:04] <gwatt> true, but that seems harder than just running the code through expand/optimize
[19:31:28] <dTal> I didn't know about expand, I was using (#%$assembly-output #t) in Chez which is not easy to interpret
[19:32:41] <gwatt> expand just runs macro expansion. expand/optimize does macro expansion and the optimizer pass. In almost all cases, it will show the final product of what gets sent to the compiler.
[19:32:58] <amazigh> I have somewhere the paper about cp0
[19:33:24] <gwatt> Some syntactic definitions just expand (void)
[19:33:36] <gwatt> * expand to void
[19:34:25] <dTal> I can't make head nor tail out of its output
[19:34:44] <dTal> this means nothing to me (lambda (#{x kwib5yaak0spytqysxho0833d-0}  #{y kwib5yaak0spytqysxho0833d-1})   #{x kwib5yaak0spytqysxho0833d-0})
[19:34:53] <gwatt> You might want to use (print-gensym #f) or (print-gensym 'pretty/suffix)
[19:35:12] <dTal> also it doesn't seem to work on functions, you have to pass it forms
[19:35:17] <gwatt> That's chez's gensym literal syntax
[19:35:23] <amazigh> Oscar Waddell PhD thesis
[19:35:41] <gwatt> Yes, you need to pass expand or expand/optimize a quoted expression
[19:35:45] <dTal> which I mean, fine, but I don't know where you're getting that it's easier than just calling (time) :P
[19:35:57] <amazigh> ^_^'
[19:36:23] <gwatt> because I can actually see what the code is and I dont' have to guess at why it might be taking longer or performing more allocations

[19:39:43] <amazigh> the REPL change stuff also like you already noticed.
[19:40:04] <amazigh> global in scheme is the same as a static variable in C
[19:40:29] <gwatt> erm, no?

[19:40:40] <amazigh> yes no, forgot to NOT
[19:40:46] <amazigh> global in scheme is NOT the same as a static variable in C
[19:41:46] <edgar-rft> beware, if you touch a static variable you'll get zapped!
[19:41:50] <amazigh> btw, I am wondering why the chez user manual recommends against side-effects at the top level of libraries, instead IIRC it is written to call an init procedure
[19:42:05] <dTal> What prompted this line of inquiry for me was the observation that Julia does indeed optimize this, *even if g is global*
[19:43:21] <gwatt> amazigh: libraries can be lazily loaded and their bodies run at odd times. If you need explicit initialization order, having an init procedure allows that
[19:44:14] <amazigh> dTal: what is global in Julia?
[19:44:33] <amazigh> what is the semantic associated with a global procedure?
[19:45:10] <amazigh> is it imported from a library? can you monkeypatch the procedure and then that monkeypatch is visible in other libraries?
[19:46:40] <amazigh> afaiu the definition that is done at top-level, can still be changed that's why it is not optimized.

[20:33:50] <mdhughes> amazigh: Returning a bytevector's not great in practice, it should be a port the proc writes to. Otherwise you're filling up RAM when returning, say, a 16GB image.
[20:35:15] <mdhughes> I don't think exceptions are that expensive in most Schemes, esp. compared to slow network traffic. Would really want to benchmark that.
[20:36:33] <mdhughes> Anything that takes more than a few positional arguments, I always want to put in a record. Request/Response records/objects are very common in web frameworks.
[20:39:46] <Zipheir> Master Perlis says: "If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some."
[20:40:31] <LeoNerd> Anything beyond about 2 or maybe 3 params, you probably wanted to name them
[20:41:18] <mdhughes> Obj-C encouraged a lot of positional named params, because that's all messages are, but doing that without mandatory keywords is icky. And you have to remember the order/copy-paste from docs every time.
[20:43:34] <amazigh> thanks for the feedback, replying here *then* I will update the page.

[20:43:50] <amazigh> mdhughes: I forgot to mention that my plan is NOT to cover all possible use case of HTTP server. My goal with for that library is to ease the practice of... well.. home cooked apps, see ^
[20:44:30] <amazigh> for use cases that require a very large request body, or very large reponse body there will be the low level http reader / writer
[20:44:44] <amazigh> (tho at this time, you can interop with the hyper server)
[20:45:41] <amazigh> you can NOT interop the http1.1 library with the hyper server to support bigger than memory requests or response

[22:19:04] <Franciman> Zipheir: are you into algebraic effect systems?
[22:21:12] <Zipheir> Franciman: Yes, although I haven't had time to research them recently.
[22:21:25] <Franciman> i am so in want of understanding them
[22:21:30] <Franciman> do you think they are a cool alternative to monads?
[22:22:06] <Zipheir> Some uses of monads, yeah.  Algebraic effects compose nicely, whereas monads don't in general.
[22:23:02] <Zipheir> IIUC you don't get the "big stack of monad transformers" problem with an AE model.
[22:23:26] <Franciman> that's neat, and i wonder what downside do we have that monads don't have?
[22:25:04] <Zipheir> It's not quite as nice a model.  You have to have an operational model of effect handlers, denotational won't cut it.
[22:27:06] <Zipheir> Or, at least you need a new kind of denotational model.  According to Oleg, the key paper here is Felleisen & Cartwright, Extensible Denotational Language Specifications http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.25.5941

[22:33:48] <sonny> sorry, day 2

[22:35:09] <Zipheir> sonny: Why are you passing the input file as the next loop argument?
[22:35:15] <Zipheir> sonny: Don't you want a character?
[22:35:31] <sonny> oh course!
[22:35:33] <Zipheir> sonny: I think that's your problem.  eof-object? is never true of a port.
[22:35:38] <sonny> what a mistake
[22:35:55] <sonny> I guess this is what types are for :P
[22:36:17] <Zipheir> Yeah. :)
[22:37:11] <sonny> Is there no char->number?
[22:37:35] <johnjaye> i'd be suprised if scheme didn't treat chars as numbers
[22:37:47] <sonny> ah it's char->integer
[22:37:54] <johnjaye> ok i'm surprised then
[22:38:09] <sonny> I don't know if it does, I'm using racket
[22:38:19] <Zipheir> johnjaye: It doesn't.
[22:38:45] <sonny> I just saw char->integer in the fixum days document <https://ds26gte.github.io/tyscheme/index-Z-H-1.html#TAG:__tex2page_toc>

[22:39:13] <Franciman> Zipheir: i have a question. Why do we care about Monads/Algebraic Effects? Can't we just put effects in, like we do with C and other impure languages?
[22:39:14] <Zipheir> johnjaye: In fact, a standards-compliant Scheme implementation can't have (number? #\a) => #t .
[22:39:26] <sonny> that is not what I expected xD
[22:40:13] <Zipheir> Franciman: Obviously yes, you can, but the question is, do you want side effects?
[22:42:51] *** Quits: atka (~atka@static-198-54-131-84.cust.tzulo.com) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[22:43:21] <Zipheir> Side effects trash the semantics of programs, since you can use them to redefine anything.  So the idea is to provide controlled effects with regular semantics.
[22:44:06] <Zipheir> IMO a big question of the future in programming languages is not "pure" vs. "effectful", but "how do you control effects?"
[22:45:55] <johnjaye> Zipheir: i guess i shouldn't blindly apply my elisp intuition to scheme then
[22:46:21] <Franciman> so Zipheir they are mostly sandboxes

[23:27:03] <Zipheir> Franciman: It's probably not a monad, in fact.  Conal Elliott argued that there's no coherent way to define equality on IO values in Haskell.
[23:28:22] <Zipheir> e.g. are (print "foo") and (print "bar") the "same" IO values?  In Haskell they'd both be of type IO (), which has exactly one member, so "yes".  But that's wonky, since they "change the world in different ways".
[23:29:08] <Zipheir> I don't think anyone has resolved this.
