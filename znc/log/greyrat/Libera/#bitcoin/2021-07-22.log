[12:15:19] <bob_x1> is there any detailed description of the story ? or nobody yet written
[12:18:03] <Ara> Scrypt uses a lot more memory than something like double sha56. The idea was that memory in asics and things of that such is more expensive than raw compute, but as luke said, the guy behind it had a gpu implementation from day one (the scrypt parameters chosen were pretty easy to gpu). I believe the person tried to play it off like the extra hashing power was a botnet or something, not a gpu version he had written

[13:35:59] <bob_x1> caveman: there is not proof of stake in bitcoin. but proof of stake has some disadvantages. Proof of stake is permissioned by coins, an internal, permissioned, and, already owned resource. You cannot gain tokens without someone choosing to give up those coins.
[13:37:06] <caveman> yes.  i'd rather trust mathematics (find right hash)
[13:37:35] <caveman> but i wonder if my fear about the permission is unreal.
[13:39:03] <dodo> caveman: the pos coins i've seen were all premine scams. so coins already exist, and the founders control the stake

[21:50:19] <sturles> I found one article where the writer obviously have no idea about what this is.
[21:51:18] <sturles> I run a regulated non-custodial exchange in an EEC country (same rules as in the EU).  Private wallets is no problem at all as long as I can identify who bought the coins I transfer to that wallet.
[21:51:35] <sturles> Which is waht the suggested regulation say.
[21:51:40] <sturles> It is already implemented-
[21:52:26] <edcba> so yeah i did read some interpretation that they don't want to allow anonymous wallets from/to exchanges
[21:52:51] <edcba> but yeah not sure about that and the law doesn't seem yet ready
[21:53:28] <sturles> I hold no BTC and no fiat currency for anyone but myself.  It is a pure exchange where people buy or sel BTC in simple atomic transactions.  Currency/BTC in -> BTC/currency out to the user's wallet/account.
[21:54:14] <edcba> i think they want to mimic actual solution with cash, banks => exchanges, cash => bitcoin

[21:54:42] <edcba> but the problem is in EU there are limits on cash usually
[21:54:54] <edcba> ie can't pay/transport more than X
[21:55:05] <edcba> with bitcoin there is no limit
[21:55:38] <edcba> now we could also declare all our addresses and every time you do some unusual stuff declare it
[21:56:01] <edcba> and if you don't do that exchanges will just reject funds
[21:56:25] <edcba> so back to colored coins
[21:56:49] <edcba> you have tainted coins then you can't get any euro
[21:58:23] <edcba> but yeah hopefully you will be able to transfer bitcoins from exchange to personnal wallets
[21:58:27] <edcba> else it's a scam

[22:11:16] <edcba> anything that will be decided by EU will be "copied" to US anyway

[22:21:59] <Evolver> I am seeing several steps ahead, and as I see it, EU is highly likely to just outlaw transfers from/to private wallets in the name of money laundering. Once it goes private, it's out of their control, and they can't have that.

[22:23:49] <Evolver> edcba: The SEC already said yesterday that they're going to regulate exchanges as securities platforms.
[22:24:03] <kic0> afaik they want to enforce the "travel rule" and this only affects on/off fiat ramps
[22:24:07] <kic0> in EU
[22:24:20] <kic0> nothing they can really do about wallets

[22:31:14] <Evolver> When the people start cycling their coins through tumblers, Monero, and VPNs, etc. is exactly when the EU will be unahppy.
[22:31:20] <Evolver> *unhappy
[22:31:38] <edcba> well ppl shouldn't do that obviously lol
[22:32:39] <Evolver> Doing that will break the EU's awareness of the custody chain, and it's when they will come harder after the private wallets

[23:15:50] <sed> I am thinking about making a crypto video course. What things should I focus on? Stuff that most people don't know?
[23:16:32] *** grettke is now known as grettke-away
[23:17:07] <edcba> maths ?
[23:17:18] <sed> what kind of math?
[23:17:29] <edcba> lol nobody knows maths :)
[23:17:33] <edcba> no i don't know
[23:18:02] <edcba> i saw ppl assuming that bitcoin relied on RSA stuff
[23:18:09] <sed> but at the same time worried it will get my funding cut off if i make one
[23:18:18] <earnestly> sed: Why PoW is the only relevant approach and why energy usage is good
[23:18:20] <edcba> but dunno what interesting stuff you can tell
[23:18:40] <sed> not proof of stake huh?
[23:18:59] <earnestly> You may not know enough to make video courses
[23:19:20] <sed> that is why i want to learn more and make one
[23:20:41] <earnestly> Perhaps research those two topics
[23:20:46] <sed> sure
[23:20:52] <earnestly> PoW/PoS and energy usage
[23:21:05] <sed> i may end up making it free as well
[23:21:29] <earnestly> Besides the usual 10hours blah, endthefud, etc.  I'm not sure how good those are
[23:21:47] <earnestly> bitcoin is because FDR happened to gold :p
[23:22:07] <sed> true
[23:22:48] <sed> I don't like wasting 10 hours but if it gets to that then we'll see
[23:22:55] <sed> i get to the point
[23:23:17] <earnestly> The sort of sentiment that seems to exist in many places is that bitcoin has no value, so the energy is "wasted".  The idea of a money having a commodity value, etc.  There's quite a lot of illogical topics like this which could be fixed
[23:23:21] <sed> end the fud i will definitely include
[23:24:15] <earnestly> Most of the energy usage arguments lose by accepting the enemies premise, for example
[23:24:22] <sed> right
[23:24:36] <sed> i will definitely keep coming back to this channel and asking and confirming stuff
[23:24:49] <earnestly> Notably that the job isn't to convince the enemy, but the audience
[23:24:52] <sed> it'll be the first crypto course made from irc lol
[23:25:09] <sed> exactly
[23:25:20] <earnestly> (So accepting their framing is immediately a losing position)
[23:25:38] <sed> agreed
[23:25:46] <earnestly> If you're good, you can change the framing, but I'm not capable of that
[23:26:22] <sed> no worries i'll handle it
[23:27:23] <sed> thanks for the recommendations

[23:43:28] <zerosith> I have a question regarding bitcoin-core for windows
[23:43:54] <zerosith> I have instlled it and downloaded the full blockchain, my purpose is to have a full node.
[23:44:33] <zerosith> I had an error restarting the client and now the blockchain doesn't load. So I'm downloading the blockchain again

[23:47:42] <zerosith> after the download I got the error 'Error initializing block database. Do you want to rebuild the block database now?"
[23:48:02] <zerosith> clickink ok, nothing happens, clicking abort, nothinh happens either
[23:50:23] <zerosith> I am downloading again since I could not make bitcoincore recheck the index and reload from what is already downloaded
[23:50:53] <zerosith> I uninstalled and deleete the bitcoin generated folder
[23:51:26] <zerosith> But I would like to hear what is the best next step to create my wallet and not mess up the blockchain index
