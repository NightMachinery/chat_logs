[00:03:00] <hassoon>  ash_m: see if there are dedicated animation transition-friendly libraries as well, especially for text
[00:03:43] <ash_worksi> hassoon: well, it's not actually text; it's a shape
[00:04:02] <ash_worksi> asking the question though has sort of highlighted in my brain what I might be able to do
[00:04:16] <ash_worksi> like skew a div with only 2 borders

[00:15:24] <ash_worksi> oo I forgot about canvas
[00:16:32] <ash_worksi> so, the end goal is an attempt to animate a moving spider profile... right now, my object would be just to get the legs moving...
[00:17:34] <ash_worksi> quite easy to visualize as an svg; the body would just be 2 ovals, and each leg, a line segment with 2 additional nodes
[00:17:44] <hassoon> if you're comfortable implementing that in css animations, go for it
[00:18:02] <ash_worksi> (spiders have 4 segments, but 1 is almost purely perspective from the profile
[00:18:23] <ash_worksi> that is, it basically extends from the spider toward you, so you can't really see it)
[00:19:05] <ash_worksi> as html elements though... each leg could be 1 div, each with a 3-sided border
[00:19:30] <ash_worksi> and then I could use matrix transforms to skew the legs into hinged lines

[01:37:57] <hassoon> ash_worksi: if your animation includes movements of lines to form figures, css animatiosn can be enough for you, basically playing with left/right/top/button/width/height

[01:44:59] <ash_worksi> I actually wish there was no movement at all
[01:45:03] <ash_worksi> just frames would be nice

[01:48:20] <ash_worksi> I guess that's the same as just putting on a very small play time
[01:48:54] <matsaman> not sure what the merit of doing this in CSS is, vs, say, SVG
[01:51:56] <ash_worksi> matsaman: that  was my first question actually
[01:55:28] <ash_worksi> matsaman: would you create an svg and then use css animations on it?
[02:00:25] <matsaman> I mean, I only can really tell that you are creating some kind of leg animation
[02:00:50] <matsaman> I'm pretty sure SVG has all sorts of ways to animate things without having to use CSS directly

[02:14:23] <ash_worksi> matsaman: there is an <animation> object, but supposedly that's falling out of style and theres GreenSock but that's a fairly large JS lib
[02:14:45] <ash_worksi> matsaman: that's why I ask how people in here would do it; just like whatever you think is the most simple and direct
[02:14:53] <ash_worksi> though you can animate svg elements using css
[02:18:28] <matsaman> I mean SVG is pretty ugly for anything complex. You're going to want an application to do almost all of it for you, where you only draw things.
[02:18:48] <matsaman> if you only want some cute little animation for a website, sure, CSS
[02:23:15] <ash_worksi> the latter is the idea
[02:23:39] <ash_worksi> not sure 100% what you meant by "SVG is pretty ugly" but w/e :P
[02:23:56] <matsaman> I mean it's an SGML based language
[02:23:59] <matsaman> so it's ugly. The end
[02:24:10] <matsaman> it's used by humans as a veritable afterthought
[02:24:30] <matsaman> and then if you add complex shapes to it, it just becomes SGML with heaps of math
[02:25:02] <matsaman> either your priority is small filesize/complexity, or it's perfect animation
[02:25:15] <matsaman> in the latter case, I don't think you really want to even look at the SVG
[02:31:25] <ash_worksi> I see; when you say SVG you mean the actual code

[19:58:11] <fweht> hi, i want to embed a vimeo video so that it covers the screen (just like object-fit: cover), unfortunately i cant use object-fit, so i tried to compute the width and height.  it works pretty well, but for very narrow browser windows, the video isnt centered but you are looking at the left side: https://jsfiddle.net/3vzxoaLn/9/
[19:58:24] <fweht> any ideas how to center it in all window sizes?
[19:59:35] <fweht> funnily, it seems to center it when the window is very wide, which is weird, as there is nothing in the css which should make a difference between narrow and wide windows?

[23:28:26] <fweht> ok make it simpler, here just with a square image, still not centering horizontally for narrow screens, how could i fix?
[23:28:31] <fweht> https://jsfiddle.net/L6jnvuqf/3/
[23:34:37] <hassoon> your width and height values are weird
[23:37:02] <hassoon> fweht: is that what you want ? https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/60
[23:38:32] <fweht> hassoon: hey sorry, the 180 should be 100, but what i want is basically object-fit cover, but manually done, in your fiddle the image doesnt cover all screen sizes
[23:38:54] <fweht> the reason for that is that object-fit cover doesnt seem to work for iframes
[23:39:26] <hassoon> iframes? you're dealing with an img, not an ifeame
[23:39:28] <hassoon> * ifeame
[23:39:32] <hassoon> * iframe
[23:39:53] <fweht> hassoon: i know, i wanted to simplify it since the image responds just as the iframe, as long as i dont use cover mode
[23:40:02] <fweht> you can just uncomment the iframe in my example
[23:40:29] <hassoon> lemme see what object-fit:cover does first.. i rarely use that
[23:41:42] <fweht> it scales the image so that it covers the screen and centers it
[23:43:23] <hassoon> fweht: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/61
[23:44:09] <hassoon> fweht: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/62
[23:44:10] <fweht> hassoon: exactly this!  and the problem is that this doesnt work on iframes.  so i tried to manually reimplement it!
[23:44:27] <hassoon> fweht: whty do you want to implement that on iframes ?
[23:44:40] <fweht> i want a vimeo video playing as background
[23:45:42] <hassoon> fweht: where is your vimeo video link/example
[23:46:08] *** Quits: salad (~cucumber@82.76.150.118) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:46:28] <fweht> https://jsfiddle.net/53pk9ux7/2/
[23:47:00] <fweht> here the numbers are not exactly computed yet, but you can see the it doesnt center itself horizontally (at least in my browser)
[23:48:26] <fweht> https://jsfiddle.net/53pk9ux7/5/ here is it with object-fit cover, i think you can only apply object-fit cover to img and svg and maybe video

[23:51:05] <hassoon> fweht: can you grab a direct <video> compatible url of the video from your vimeo env ?
[23:51:41] <fweht> ill try!
[23:52:00] <hassoon> fweht: video tags a commonly used for video backgrounds
[23:52:06] <hassoon> * are commonly *
[23:52:41] <fweht> cool, good to know!  i just pasted the code from the vimeo embedding service!
[23:53:17] <hassoon> fweht: nah don't take an embedded code, look up the direct video url
[23:53:38] <fweht> will do!
[23:58:02] <fweht> thanks!
