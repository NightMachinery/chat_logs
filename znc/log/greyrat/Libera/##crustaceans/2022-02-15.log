[06:15:24] <gwozniak> This was written by someone I think generally has interesting things to say, but boy, does that sound like utopian thinking
[06:15:43] <wrl> no it cannot
[06:15:44] <wrl> hth

[06:23:20] <gwozniak> The only reason being that it showed up in an article that was relevant to my research for the essay
[07:02:18] <gwozniak> I'm now watching the talk and it takes an interesting approach, but I still think it's missing the fundamental issue with making everything easily accessible to everyone
[07:02:46] <gwozniak> Granted, the talk is 5+ years old, so maybe there was still some hope then

[07:08:28] <gwozniak> Oh yes, I saw that earlier
[07:08:35] <manicennui> GiveSendGo, the Christian crowdfunding site that helped raise $8.7 million for the anti-vax ‚Äúfreedom convoy‚Äù in Canada, was hacked on Sunday night.
[07:08:44] <gwozniak> So many tears
[07:08:47] <manicennui> Jesus sucks at security
[07:09:07] <gwozniak> They can take comfort in knowing the hackers are going to hell
[07:10:09] <manicennui> Early last week TechCrunch revealed that security researchers had discovered 50GB of unsecured GiveSendGo data including scans of passports and driver‚Äôs licenses. The crowdfunding platform said it fixed the issue, but the Daily Dot reported Thursday that the data was still accessible.
[07:10:12] <gwozniak> Watching this talk I can only think about how naive it is.  It feels like the papers from the mid-70s and early 80s about a "programmer's helper"

[07:24:09] <manicennui> gwozniak: I think people use loaded terms like that because they think it makes their case stronger.
[07:24:26] <manicennui> Like when people call things a natural right or whatever.

[20:21:13] <companion_cube> and you can literally index by parts of the json ü§Ø
[20:21:13] <prussian> When I first learned about the virtual table stuff I was blown away
[20:21:15] <prussian> And that too
[20:21:19] <prussian> Ya it's weird as fuck
[20:21:25] <prussian> But great
[20:21:43] <companion_cube> yeah like https://github.com/osquery/osquery

[20:22:20] <riv> hmm
[20:22:26] <riv> people are telling me that the sqlite page is a parody?
[20:22:29] <companion_cube> this is a bunch of virtual tables in sqlite
[20:22:33] <companion_cube> what?
[20:22:33] <riv> i assume everything is real...

[20:23:54] <prussian> companion_cube: lmao

[20:24:26] <companion_cube> tbh the little blessing didn't annoy me
[20:24:35] <companion_cube> it doesn't even sound particularly christian
[20:25:12] <prussian> if the software works, yolo.
[20:25:37] <prussian> really can't be assed to know the intimate details of the various whackos I probably depend on, directly or otherwise.
[20:25:58] <companion_cube> https://www.sqlite.org/src/file?name=src/btree.c&ci=trunk <-- look at the header
[20:25:59] <buttsbot> SQLite: btree.c at trunk
[20:26:25] <riv> omg the code is so good
[20:26:35] <riv> just look at these comments that actually tell you what a function does
[20:26:42] <riv> we need more of that
[20:26:49] <wrl> "You can read that thread to get a grasp on what it‚Äôs like as a Christian in the day-to-day SF/Valley Tech world"
[20:26:52] <wrl> oh boo hoo
[20:27:02] <prussian> lmao
[20:27:21] <companion_cube> does Hipp even live in the silicon valley?
[20:27:24] <prussian> watch out for the demon worshipping SF people
[20:28:26] <wrl> it's the same shit all the fucking time
[20:28:32] <epilys> I've read the sqlite source code many times and can confirm it's really well documented
[20:28:34] <wrl> *running* the united states is never enough
[20:28:40] <wrl> everybody else has to *like* them, too
[20:28:40] <companion_cube> it's also incredibly well tested apparently
[20:28:52] <epilys> yeah but some of their test cases are proprietary unfortunately
[20:29:07] <prussian> wait wut
[20:29:11] <epilys> also I was trying to hook up the tests with a custom VFS and it was very difficult
[20:29:13] <companion_cube> even the public subset is probably more than a lot of other projects :D
[20:29:22] <epilys> indeed
[20:29:43] <epilys> (btw I'm talking about the TCL test set, which is open source)
[20:32:19] <epilys> If you want a blazing fast fearless sqlite, reminder that I rewrote the entire thing in Rust https://github.com/epilys/rsqlite3

[20:33:02] <prussian> Whoa...
[20:33:27] <prussian> Nice use of ‚ÄΩ
[20:33:27] <epilys> (It's a joke)
[20:33:32] <prussian> Oh...
[20:33:46] <epilys> it works though
[20:33:48] <epilys> and compiles
[20:33:49] <companion_cube> :D
[20:34:05] <companion_cube> you mean it's not suddenly super thread safe? damn
[20:34:06] <prussian> It's just machine translated sqlite amalgamation huh?
[20:34:19] <epilys> transpiled with the c2rust project

[20:34:47] <companion_cube> good title btw.
[20:34:59] <companion_cube> now I wonder how big sqlite is? how many loc?
[20:35:41] <epilys> https://sqlite.org/amalgamation.html This file contains about 238K lines of code (or 145K if you omit blank lines and comments) and is over 8.4 megabytes in size (as of 2021-12-29).
[20:35:41] <buttsbot> The SQLite Amalgamation
[20:38:07] <companion_cube> heh, not too bad
[20:38:13] <companion_cube> one day I should read that
[20:38:15] <Xe> the great part about the amalgamation is that it's automatically LTO'd
[20:38:21] <companion_cube> the btree and locking system and all that ‚ô•
[20:39:25] <Church> Awesome, we're gonna OSS the even more fun bits at work
[20:39:31] <epilys> the unix locks? that part is somewhat confusing (I had to re-implement it and studied it a lot)
[20:40:55] <companion_cube> I have no idea, does it use a file lock?
[20:41:10] <companion_cube> that'd explain the only-one-writer thing of course.

[21:07:58] <prussian> god I hate interviews where the guy you're talking to is 100% poker face.
[21:08:26] <prussian> gerikson: many such cases.

[21:37:36] <ngoldbaum> doing algorithm style whiteboard interviews with someone who doesn‚Äôt make it a conversation is pretty terrible
[21:53:13] <jlindgren> agreed. if you have to do a whiteboard interview at leaste make it fun
[21:54:53] <edk> i don't know if i've ever done a coding question at an interview that was hard enough to have a conversation about
[21:55:32] <edk> it's always like, list fibonacci numbers, generate the permutations of a string, work out what day of the week it is on a date
[22:08:40] <riv> one of those sounds a hell of a lot harder than the others :P
[22:10:29] * jlindgren aggressively inverts binary tree
[22:10:48] <riv> did anyone every figure out what that even meant :P
[22:15:49] <ngoldbaum> inverting binary trees is my fetish
[22:16:47] <kline> edk, what would you do for the day of week one
[22:16:53] <kline> just google the doomsday algorithm or something?
[22:17:02] <kline> realistically im sure there is a stdlib tool for this in python
[22:18:34] <ngoldbaum> it does require using the datetime API but yes

[22:21:17] <jlindgren> brave man
[22:51:41] <gthm> edk: at $work we have coding interview questions that are almost all very hard graph traversal questions, some with combinatorial explosions attached. this is for a job where 100% of your time is spent not doing those things
[22:52:09] <gthm> I'm not invited to the rest of the interviewers' parties
[22:52:12] <riv> lol
[22:52:14] <riv> whyyy
[22:52:27] <gthm> BECAUSE ALGORITHM KNOWLEDGE
[22:53:18] <gthm> I've argued for adding questions that are more representative of the work people end up doing and gotten feedback along the lines of "this is solvable with two for loops"
[22:53:25] <gthm> to which I reply "yes, and?"
[22:54:00] <riv> that's not enough for loops!!
[23:06:34] <ehammarstrom> whiteboard interviews are weird, glad i've never had to do one

[23:19:29] <edk> kline: i think the doomsday algorithm is for humans really and i don't know it offhand so no. i'd assume we are always gregorian. the problem is equivalent to asking how many days between two dates, so it's just about counting leap days. i know the pattern they make; in an interview context, because i think it's harder to get wrong, i'd just generate the 400-year pattern in an array and then look things
[23:19:29] <edk> up in it
[23:19:35] <edk> that would be something worth talking about, i admit
[23:19:53] <edk> gthm: well, that seems ungreat
[23:20:25] <kline> edk, i was just curious if there was some "interview correct" answer other than today-then % 7 with todays day
[23:20:48] <edk> i was imagining you wouldn't just cop out and use the stdlib
[23:21:10] <edk> the maths is not very hard but it's off-by-1-error prone
[23:23:08] <edk> i tried it without taking any shortcuts: https://kellett.im/d/2IfVjymJJNVX.py -- missed the y == 0 case at first
[23:24:04] <riv> i wonder if there are like
[23:24:06] <riv> extra days
[23:24:10] <riv> i know about leap days
[23:24:22] <riv> but I would not be at all surprised if there was a bunch of extra special cases that i've never heard of
[23:24:32] <edk> there have been extra days inserted when switching between two calendars
[23:24:38] <riv> o_o
[23:25:39] <edk> at least i think there have. when the gregorian calendar was implemented 10 days were deleted
[23:30:43] <edk> ah yes
[23:30:45] <manicennui> If you are writing your own code to do date arithmetic, you are doing something wrong.
[23:30:55] <manicennui> People spend years getting this shit right.
[23:31:02] <manicennui> Use your language's popular option.
[23:31:06] <edk> when the julian calendar was first implemented we got two whole extra months
[23:31:28] <edk> dear me, manicennui, what must it be like to live in your head
[23:31:52] <riv> waaat
[23:32:00] <riv> this is interesting!
[23:32:24] <manicennui> Been burned enough times by people thinking they should write their own code to handle this stuff instead of using well tested libraries.
[23:33:05] <companion_cube> it's funny how we can alternate between that, and criticizing people who use log4j ;)
[23:33:10] <riv> there used to be this awful meme in the crypto community "don't write your own crypto"
[23:33:14] <companion_cube> (not that it's invalid, I mean, datetime is hard)
[23:33:22] <riv> we actually should have been saying "don't write your own date and time code"
[23:33:23] <manicennui> riv: How is that an awful meme?
[23:33:36] <riv> case we ended up with openssl being the main player :P
[23:33:41] <riv> and gpg
[23:34:24] <manicennui> riv: That doesn't mean that developers at each company should write an implementation of AES.
[23:34:24] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[23:34:55] <manicennui> Just as there have been a few different popular libraries for Java.
[23:35:03] <edk> no. but two things: (1) gatekeeping is lame and (2) sometimes people talk about programming problems just because they're fun
[23:35:36] <manicennui> "gatekeeping" is necessary at work.
[23:35:40] <edk> you're not at work
[23:35:51] <riv> oh yeah! gatekeeping
[23:35:57] <riv> i never even thought of it like that
[23:35:57] <manicennui> I didn't ask you not to talk about it.
[23:36:00] <riv> but that's exactly what it is
[23:37:04] <ngoldbaum> it definitely is
[23:37:19] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs checking if you have an undergrad CS degree or equivalent knowledge
[23:37:30] <ngoldbaum> even if the undergrad CS curriculum has no overlap with the role
[23:37:36] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs about culture and gatekeepinf
[23:40:38] <edk> i think those interviews select for "being good at coding interviews" as much as knowledge
[23:40:47] <riv> https://0x0.st/o8az.txt   sus ‡∂û
[23:41:37] <edk> 1752 was julian->gregorian switch in america and uk
[23:42:47] <ngoldbaum> mike duncan is currently covering the russian revolution on his podcast
[23:43:02] <manicennui> riv: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_(New_Style)_Act_1750
[23:43:02] <buttsbot> Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 - Wikipedia
[23:43:06] <ngoldbaum> when he get to the day they finally switched to the gregorian calendar you could hear the relief in his voice
[23:43:18] <manicennui> "The Act elided eleven days from September 1752."
[23:43:42] <riv> haha :)
[23:49:33] <manicennui> I recently learned that the Earth's rotation is actually almost 4 minutes short of 24 hours.
[23:52:52] <companion_cube> riv: don't write your own database
[23:53:05] <companion_cube> joke aside, yeah, gatekeeping can be good if it's on really hard things
[23:53:11] <companion_cube> it doesn't mean "never ever do it"
[23:53:21] <manicennui> It's also different from day-to-day work and interviews.
[23:53:27] <companion_cube> but rather "if you do this, be prepared to have to learn intense stuff for years and suffer a lot"
[23:53:31] <manicennui> These sort of things are terrible interview questions.
[23:54:33] <manicennui> The only real reason to have a coding portion of an interview is verify skills to some extent, but it is hard to do well in that setting.
[23:55:20] <manicennui> Ideally we'd be able to trust people based on their experience.
[23:55:41] <manicennui> But people lie and many companies do a bad job of getting rid of incompetent people.
[23:57:12] <manicennui> Sports and arts are the main professions I can think of that do something similar.
[23:57:38] <manicennui> Although pro sports eventually have very public examples of experience.
[23:57:44] <ehammarstrom> manicennui: I like the idea of sending someone home with a small project, paid hours for the expected duration of the project; and then just invite the interviewee to go over the decisions made and possible improvements
[23:58:18] <manicennui> Do orchestras still require auditions for people who have played in another major orchestra for years?
[23:58:59] <manicennui> ehammarstrom: Seems good on the surface. Also seems easy to "cheat".
[23:59:24] <manicennui> I guess I don't understand the point of cheating on such things unless the company doesn't fire people when they find out that they can't do the work.
