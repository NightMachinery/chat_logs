[08:59:46] <sandra> This is sort of a design / architecture level question but those can still be fun:
[08:59:46] <sandra> With multimethods, you can have a :default and then you can make special exceptions to that default.
[08:59:46] <sandra> But it's difficult to then verify by assertions that you really are handling those exceptions.
[08:59:46] <sandra> For example, let's say you have birds that can fly per default and then you want to add in a multimethod to handle penguins that don't fly. If you start putting in a bunch of (assert (not penguin)) and (assert (not ostrich)) stuff in your default, there's no point in even using a multimethod in the first place. (Since that'd be to try to handle dispatch in two places.)
[08:59:46] <sandra> If you try to send your penguins off a cliff it'll be a disaster so you really want to put in some error checking here but it's not clear were that'd go or how to untangle this issue.

[09:57:48] <ridcully_> i'd not use implementation knowledge in :default - either it's an error to reach default or not
[09:59:16] <sandra> That's what I'm saying. So this creates an interesting dilemma. For all the birds out there we wanna fly and then for these weirdo non-flying birds we want to get sure that they get sent to their specific defmethods.
[10:01:38] <andinus> so i have a Persistentlist and want to join the elements
[10:01:59] <ridcully_> add can-fly? and make the default an error.  or don't care
[10:02:07] <andinus> (join (reverse "string")) doesn't seem to work
[10:04:37] <ridcully_> andinus: "does not work" means what?
[10:05:33] <ridcully_> `join` on it's own would mean you would have to `use` or `refer` and that is most likely not the best thing to do
[10:06:29] <andinus> the repl becomes unresponsive -- no errors either
[10:08:15] <ridcully_> is your cpu-load spiking?  do you reverse a string with the size of the atoms in the universe?
[10:09:18] <andinus> no cpu spikes
[10:09:32] <andinus> i restaretd the repl, it says this now: Unable to resolve symbol: join in this context
[10:10:02] <andinus> there is clojure.strings/reverse that does what i want, i was trying to do it manually
[10:10:23] <ridcully_> join is also in clojure.string
[10:11:00] <ridcully_> ,(do (require 'clojure.string) (clojure.string/join (reverse "hello"))) ; should work
[10:11:50] <andinus> thanks, it does work
[10:12:19] <andinus> how to get docs for bare "join"? or any function for that matter
[10:14:02] <ridcully_> in the repl `doc` and `apropos` - or search the web.  most editors after some setup can show the docs inline

[11:03:42] <Para> I also haven't tried but hierarchical keywords might work with multimethods? Although they can be PITA on the other side then, as there's no type checking to ensure you remember to stop your penguin from flying and that it doesn't eat worms.
[11:04:13] <sandra> Methodical looks amazing, I love CLOS. But it doesn't seem to address this particular issue
[11:04:58] <sandra> Right, that's what we have now. Derive, isa in vectors etc

[11:09:35] <Para> One could do it as a protocol as well but I've found that clunky as well. That might be just me.
[11:11:19] <sandra> Cond kind of has the same paranoia. "How do I know it's really using the right multimethod" is similar to "How do I know it's really using the right cond clause." A lack of trust in the language. I should just jam some comprehensive unit tests in there
