[02:52:20] <radix0> See, this video is the kind that irks me. Around 9:15 they connect to an SSH server but doesn't mention that the fingerprint needs to be confirmed out of band.

[02:53:56] <radix0> ideally
[02:54:03] <Work-BWMerlin> I *think* I understand what you are saying.  How do you know that the server you connected to is indeed the server you were intending to connect to right?
[02:54:13] <radix0> But how do you verify the user's pubkey out of band? :thinking:
[02:54:20] <radix0> Work-BWMerlin, correct
[02:54:44] <technonerd> with ssh-ca ?
[02:55:20] <radix0> Never used a CA for openssh keys before personally. But all you've done is moved the problem up one step. It's easier and more hierarchical, but you still have to secure transmit a public key.
[02:56:54] <sd> 08<aâ€‹wlnx> am I missing something here?
[02:57:12] <sd> 08<aâ€‹wlnx> I usually just ssh into the server, install the key and then disable password auth
[02:57:44] <radix0> When you remote into the ssh server for the first time, do you verify the thumbprint of the server?
[02:59:10] <sd> 08<aâ€‹wlnx> you mean hit yes on the thumbprint prompt? yes. I don't verify cryptographically, if there something I *should* be doing let me know. Generally I just see that the IP address is what it could be
[02:59:51] <radix0> OK well what you're doing when you enter 'yes' is in principal the exact same thing when you see an HTTPS "we can't verify the identity of this server" message in a web browser and click "continue anyway".
[03:00:20] <sd> 08<aâ€‹wlnx> sure, sort of
[03:00:23] <radix0> So you should be comparing the hash you received in your ssh client to the hash of the server's key via a secure channel.
[03:00:51] <sd> 08<aâ€‹wlnx> of the private or public
[03:00:56] <radix0> Public. Otherwise you could be the victim of a MITM and not even know it
[03:01:02] <Work-BWMerlin> Would the only way to truely verify the thumb print to be to have physical access to the server, have it show the thumb print and save that somewhere and then when you connect and get prompted to accept the thumb print compare it to what you have saved?
[03:01:23] <sd> 08<aâ€‹wlnx> unlikely but true
[03:01:31] <radix0> How do you know that's unlikely?
[03:02:09] <radix0> Work-BWMerlin, there are several ways to verify. If you don't own the server but you trust the operator of the server, hopefully you can verify with them in some other way (as technonerd mentioned, dnssec + sshfp dns records is one such method).
[03:02:27] <Work-BWMerlin> Would 802.1x solve this as you would have to have access to the device during the initial config to enable it?
[03:02:31] <sd> 08<aâ€‹wlnx> Elite hackers are gonna get me within 10 minutes of enabling ssh and setting up pki
[03:02:48] <radix0> 802.1x doesn't solve the problem of public key trust.
[03:03:43] <sd> 08<aâ€‹wlnx> It's a good tip I will file it away in my brainhole
[03:03:50] <Work-BWMerlin> Would it not because you wouldn't need public key then?
[03:04:48] <radix0> Work-BWMerlin, Imagine you are on public IP address 192.0.2.42 and you are connecting to an SSH server for the first time at public IP address 203.0.113.59. How does 802.1x solve anything?

[03:06:13] <Work-BWMerlin> Ah, I think I found a flaw in my logic.
[03:06:15] <xe0n> LOL
[03:06:25] <rpifan> of course not
[03:06:34] <Work-BWMerlin> Because the end device could then have 802.1x enabled to harvest your credentials
[03:07:11] <radix0> I'm not sure I'm following any of your line of reasoning. 802.1x controls access to a L2 domain. It has nothing to do with end-to-end security.
[03:07:50] <Work-BWMerlin> What I was thinking was, if you had 802.1x you wouldn't need PKI because 802.1x would handle the auth
[03:08:05] <xe0n> even more reason to have PKI :P
[03:08:08] <radix0> But how do you trust the 802.1x authenticator is who it says it is?
[03:08:10] <Work-BWMerlin> Which is true it will so no PKI, but it doesn't handle the verifying that the end device is truely the end device
[03:08:30] <sd> 08<aâ€‹wlnx> I don't know a single IAAS or PAAS provider that doesn't give you the public key when you enable ssh
[03:08:38] <radix0> Exactly. Trust needs to be established no matter what.
[03:08:47] <Work-BWMerlin> That was the bit I was missing, the verifying that it was the end device which was what you were saying
[03:09:16] <rpifan> i agree
[03:09:27] <sd> 08<aâ€‹wlnx> also as long as you have console access to the machine

[03:15:17] <radix0> I'll also never understand why some vendors use the h.h.h notation. It makes no sense to me.

[03:21:22] <radix0> I've always wondered what the grandfather of "modern" networking operating systems would be. Cisco, HP, Mellanox, 3com....everyone has roughly the same cli "feel". They must have all taken inspiration from either some grandfather or from one another. I'm too green to know anything about super early networking.
[03:21:37] <Work-BWMerlin> Why do I care if it is a gig port, just give me port 47
[03:21:53] <radix0> Work-BWMerlin, switch stacking. gi1 could be switch 1 and gi2 could be switch 2. Also a switch could have several banks (modular switches).
[03:22:23] <Work-BWMerlin> yeah so why not a47 like HPE
[03:22:35] <radix0> Each number in your example refers to a specific term, I can't remember them right now. Not familiar with HPE.

[14:28:03] <Joe-Developer> you think I don't have myself ABOVE the firewall filter
[14:28:11] <Joe-Developer> not like sophos does proper reporting anyway its shit
[14:28:26] <Joe-Developer> have to look into something else for filter reporting because it's not checking the safeguarding box
[14:28:29] <thegodsquirrel> I surprised its still working TBH
[14:29:11] <Joe-Developer> well it doesn't filter correctly like on my phone it doesn't recognise it's me logged in so I get default filtering, the firewall box randomly bricks itself and the reporting is shite

[14:30:11] <Joe-Developer> he just doesn't care coz the filter recognises him so he doesn't get filtering on his phone I just have to use 4g

[14:33:57] <thegodsquirrel> I've run Fortigate before and that is not awful
[14:34:05] <Joe-Developer> like there'll be a best practice on where to block things, where to shape traffic where to make exceptions etc. but how it was setup is shite
[14:34:13] <Joe-Developer> it's just all over the place
[14:34:22] <Joe-Developer> fortigate the school had when I was a student
[14:34:22] <teh_f4ll3n> we still run pfsense in vms

[22:14:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> how much data volume are you talking

[22:14:50] <PublicWiFi> i can do offline stuff with veeam but i'd have to remember to replug the thing every day lol
[22:15:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> veeam cloud connect would e offline
[22:15:14] <PublicWiFi> uhh i can't remember how big the DB is now
[22:15:23] <AnonymooseReddtr> I used a cheap NAS as an iSCSI endpoint for my veeam repo @ old old job
[22:15:30] <AnonymooseReddtr> presented that disk ONLY to my veeam vm

[22:16:02] <PublicWiFi> AnonymooseReddtr: that is what we do now
[22:16:08] <AnonymooseReddtr> I did Disk to disk backup and then offsite via veeam cloud connect
[22:16:19] <Hunterkll> Tape is wicked fast to restore from 
[22:16:24] <PublicWiFi> I have a NAS presented as a linux server in veeam, its off-site and uses a totally seperate openVPN connection
[22:16:28] <Hunterkll> Last backup system I had was D2D2T 
[22:16:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> not a bad setup
[22:16:51] <PublicWiFi> so totally diff creds and stuff, and is only accessible from the veeam VM due to the p2p vpn
[22:16:55] <iphone> tape is great in a raid0 array, sooper fast
[22:16:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> oh
[22:16:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> thats good
[22:17:06] <AnonymooseReddtr> Hunterkll depends what you are restoring from the tape
[22:17:19] <AnonymooseReddtr> did a shit load with tape previously but it was geo physical data
[22:17:22] <AnonymooseReddtr> so tonnes of little tiny files
[22:17:23] <Hunterkll> onstinably entire VMs or databases  
[22:17:26] <sintax> we just set up immutable backups in aws on a linux hardened thing a ma jig
[22:17:31] <PublicWiFi> ah maybe that overhead of tiny files did it

[22:40:31] <Sousapro> Considering that it's all displayport, I agree 
[22:41:44] <iphone> yeah, display technology has been pretty stagnant so the generic drivers should work like 99.99% of the time

[22:56:52] <Sousapro> Good lol
[22:58:38] <dragonfleas> Any of you ever worked for a software agency before?
[22:58:44] <dragonfleas> Like subcontracted software companies
[22:58:52] <dragonfleas> If so, how was it? are those environments good?
[22:59:03] <dragonfleas> Are they as perilous as MSP?
[22:59:12] <iphone> I subcontract for a web dev shop / MSP
[22:59:17] <Sousapro> My experience has been on the receiving end of one of those 
[22:59:34] <Sousapro> The code quality and experience was... Uh... Interesting. 
[22:59:55] <dragonfleas> I'm sure they differ a lot, but a full-stack engineer buddy of mine is trying to get me on-board at his place as a devops engineer and I wanted to know if I was in for 80 hour billable hour stress weeks and crying myself to sleep every night
[23:00:38] <Sousapro> I had to sit on them daily otherwise any small roadblock would mean that they would do no work and then email me 1 minute before close of business to explain how a minor inconvenience resulted in 30 people doing nothing for 8 hours 
[23:00:53] <Sousapro> dragonfleas: it'll build your skills 
[23:01:05] <Sousapro> Might be worth it as a transitional role
[23:01:19] <iphone> didn't you just start a new job too?
[23:02:50] <dragonfleas> yes but there are reasons i want to leave
[23:02:59] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> CptLuxx: won't stop them from developing new cheating techniques
[23:03:04] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> like aimbot AI
[23:06:12] <dragonfleas> You know, that makes me think
[23:06:18] <dragonfleas> Those big cheat development companies out there
[23:06:31] <dragonfleas> the big name ones, they have to have a CI/CD pipeline, and must have devops engineers
[23:06:46] <dragonfleas> they're probably all foreign to USA though
[23:10:32] <Hunterkll> @Haise shiiit i use to run CS in WINE and crank the gamma up in X11 so that I could see better in dark without having to use the nightivsion stuff so i had no abrupt transitions or washed out views going between lit and dark places
[23:10:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:10:33] *** Joins: sintax (~sintax@user/sintax)

[23:10:51] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> dayum
[23:10:56] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> I have trauma from WINE
[23:11:02] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Proton made it less traumatizing
[23:11:29] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> also
[23:11:38] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> this SCCM instance has been installing for 1 hour
[23:11:38] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> lol
[23:11:49] <Hunterkll> sounds like you undersized ram/cpu
[23:11:58] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> 6 cores / 16 gigs of RAM
[23:12:10] <Hunterkll> that is still rather unusual 
[23:12:30] <Sousapro> dragonfleas: mostly China India or Russia
[23:12:32] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> eh I'm gonna let it set itself up, can't change resources rn
[23:12:53] <Hunterkll> mine's sitting at 14GB idle without doing much of anything
[23:12:54] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:13:12] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> how many PCs do you have under it ?
[23:13:21] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> or server installs
[23:13:34] <Hunterkll> talking  to it right now? like 20 online i guess 
[23:13:38] <Hunterkll> ton more offline atm 
[23:13:42] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> ah
[23:13:50] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> I am gonna have 20-25 probably
[23:14:07] <Hunterkll> I don't have SQL ram limit configured either so 
[23:14:12] <Hunterkll> i could probably tighten that up a bit more
[23:14:13] <Sousapro> Haise: yeah proton keeps getting more and more development on it. Steam Deck is going to be huge even if it's only in getting Valve to focus and market Proton
[23:14:29] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Proton with EAC and BE update is great
[23:14:31] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> only problem is
[23:14:40] <Hunterkll> but yea i'm configured with 4 vCPU and 1GB boot memory with dynamic expansion enabled 
[23:14:45] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> if you step outside Steam and want to use another launcher
[23:14:47] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> good luck
[23:14:55] <Hunterkll> on E5-v2 series xeons on a insane storage config
[23:14:58] <Hunterkll> if mines faster than yours
[23:15:01] <Hunterkll> somethin is whack
[23:15:02] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:15:03] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> Hunterkll: my MS SQL instance has 8 gb RAM limit atm
[23:15:25] <Hunterkll> configured inside of SQL?
[23:15:41] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> I opened SSMS and told it I want 8192 MBs as max memory
[23:15:49] <Hunterkll> yea ok you did it right then
[23:15:59] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> just followed MS docs
[23:16:14] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> don't want to make hot water when its few clicks away
[23:16:50] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> I can manage Android under SCCM right ?
[23:16:56] <sd> 09<Hâ€‹aise> or that is Intune only

[23:22:23] <sintax> oh well then
[23:22:54] <sintax> i love that we get random software that we're expected to support. i don't even know where they got it and why it doesn't work. ffs
