[23:21:11] <gwozniak> I see block programming in the example

[23:24:14] <manicennui> But it's not just "if". It's the entire line of code.
[23:24:18] <indigo> I like the "here's an example program, here's what each part does, now modify it to do X" style of learning
[23:24:20] <manicennui> This is a terrible way to think about programming.
[23:24:52] <gwozniak> Maybe it's okay for thinking about algorithms
[23:25:02] <manicennui> As if you are going to sit down to write a program and all you need to do is drag the pre-written lines into place.
[23:25:40] <gwozniak> I've tried the block thing before and I find it very cumbersome

[23:26:16] <gwozniak> And I've supervised classes using the blocks stuff.  Its efficacy varied a lot
[23:26:39] <manicennui> This just seems like it would lead to more guessing with no real understanding.
[23:28:01] <maskd> I looked at the other examples and they don't seem very inspiring but I see what they're trying to do, the programming one is a lot less clear
[23:28:13] <gwozniak> I don't know what the CS pedagogical research says on the matter, but I remember it being a mixed bag some years ago
[23:28:49] <maskd> I guess it's a bit like the Duolingo thing where you translate a sentence by choosing among a list of words the app gives you
[23:29:08] <manicennui> For memorization tasks maybe it makes more sense.
[23:29:34] <manicennui> I feel like it would work best for things like physics where you could make small changes to see their effects.

[23:30:28] <technomancy> it's not really about learning programming; it's about learning how to break down problems, clearly state your intent, and debugging
[23:30:33] <technomancy> all prerequisites to programming
[23:31:40] <manicennui> Does this do that?
[23:31:49] <manicennui> The problem is already broken down into lines of code.
[23:32:28] <technomancy> I guess I'm talking more about drag-and-drop systems in general, I didn't look at this specific one
[23:32:38] <aman> the course is titled Software Development too, very misleading
[23:33:01] <aman> assuming the entirety of the course is drag and drop in nature
[23:33:06] <maskd> I guess we'll all have to sign up and try it out
[23:33:14] <manicennui> aman: No idea whether that is the case.
[23:33:17] <manicennui> I hope not.
