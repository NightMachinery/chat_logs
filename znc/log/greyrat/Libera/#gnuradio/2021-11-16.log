[05:29:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> There can be a large number of reasons for an on-the-air radio channel not working quite as well as the simulated one.    Too-much/too-little signal at the receiver.  On-channel interference.  TX side distortion caused by incorrect gain settings, insufficient gain settings on the RX side.  Failing to leave enough "dead time" in front of your samples to allow the TX chain to switch on fully, multi-path loss issues, etc, etc.

[05:33:43] <linge93[m]> patchvonbraun: Yes, but the strange thing is that the number of data packets will only be lost after a certain limit. If you only send a text file with less data, there will be no packet loss. 
[05:35:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> Are you seeing 'O' or 'U' indications after that limit?
[05:37:18] *** Joins: LOWWer (~LOWWer@17-14-139.cgnat.fonira.net)
[05:38:32] <linge93[m]> what is 'O' or 'U'?
[05:39:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> 'O' == Overrun.  Many drivers print a single 'O' to the console whenever there's an overrun--the radio is providing samples faster than they can be processed.
[05:39:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> 'U' == Underrun.  Same thing, only for TX, which means the TX is needing samples faster than the computer can provide them.
[05:40:18] <linge93[m]> I don’t see these two characters printed on my console 
[05:41:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> You're using the examples from gr-digital?  I don't know much about them, but it wouldn't surprise me to find that they have some subtle bugs.
[05:42:42] <linge93[m]> Yes, I am using the sample program 
[05:44:09] <linge93[m]> I am curious about the ‘multiply const’ in front of "UHD: USRP Sink", why do I need to limit the amplitude? 
[05:45:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> The amplitude has to be limited because OFDM symbols are high PAPR. Which means that it's easy to overload the analog RF bits and pieces.  NO sample leaving GR towards a radio should ever exceed +/- 1.0 and in reality, it needs to be limited to lower than that to prevent hitting non-linearities in teh analog RF bits and pieces.
[05:46:07] <patchvonbraun[m]> Understanding this sort of thing is critical in designing end-to-end RF systems.
[05:48:25] <linge93[m]> Could this be the cause of the decrease in the number of data packets? If I set the value of ‘multiply const’ to a very small value, the SNR of low-amplitude signals will drop very low. 
[05:49:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> But that wouldn't account for "after a few packets", unless those packets have the property of producing very low amplitude modulations which would be very unusual.  
[05:51:12] <patchvonbraun[m]> Of course it could be the case that after the RF amps get a little warm, their linearity gets even worse.  Back off the TX RF gain and limit the amplitude of the samples to perhaps no more than 0.8.  See if that makes a difference.
[05:56:34] <linge93[m]> I checked the data behind the ‘multiply const’ of my sending system, and some symbols have amplitudes exceeding 1, but the smallest value is 0! (Real part) This confuses me 
[05:57:16] *** Joins: CatCow (~wtf_over@c-73-96-109-206.hsd1.or.comcast.net)
[05:57:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> Consider a normalied sine wave.  Does it ever cross the zero line?
[05:58:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> The answer is "yes, of course it does".  Long periods of zeros (or any other fixed value) likely indicate a problem.
[05:58:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> It amplitudes exceed 1, then, yes, you'll need that multiply const to be less than 1 to keep the peak values safely below 1.
[05:59:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> If you don't, the driver will clip them to +/-1 and you'll get horribly distorted signals out the TX just from the clipping, AND at those kinds of levels, the analog RF gain components will likely be in their not-very-linear operating range.
[06:00:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> That's just a fact of RF life--PARTICULARLY with OFDM, which has high PAPR, and is thus more sensitive to hitting the linearity ceilnig.
[06:09:31] <linge93[m]> I tried to control the amplitude to be less than 1, but the packet loss problem still exists. How should I troubleshoot the problem? 
[06:10:23] <patchvonbraun[m]> What is your TX gain setting?
[06:10:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> Are you doing this over-the-air (with antennas) or direct-cabled?  
[06:11:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> If there's a frequency sink on the RX side, what does it look like? Is it considerably different when packet-loss starts?
[06:12:01] <linge93[m]> The RF gain is 80db, and the antenna used for transmission 
[06:12:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> This is a B2xx type device?  
[06:12:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> Try cranking the RF gain down about 10dB
[06:12:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> Other than that, I don't know enough about the OFDM examples to be of much help.
[06:15:45] <linge93[m]> I don’t know when the packet loss started, because what I detect is the number of symbols in the payload, the frequency receiver looks the same as when it was sent, and the packet loss rate is relatively small, about 0.01 or less

[06:32:13] <BarryDuggan[m]> I haven't dug into OFDM, but in the packet examples there is a max packet size (abt 1500 iirc) so larger messages need to be broken up. it probably doesn't apply in your case - just a thought
[06:36:23] <linge93[m]> If there is a limit on the maximum number of data packets, then it is a fatal flaw for the communication system. I just want to send a picture and there are already many data packets.

[12:11:39] <DerekKozel[m]> They show reading a variable or a message and acting on it
[12:12:04] <jemius> hm, ok. That should do the trick, then..
[12:12:23] <DerekKozel[m]> GRC only covers a portion of what's possible, to use more complex behaviors a little bit of code usually needs to be added
[12:13:16] <DerekKozel[m]> The Python Block, Module, and Snippet blocks have made it easier to stay in GRC while using a little of your own code
[12:13:19] *** Joins: bandnyquist (~Rheanna@61.171.69.141)
[12:13:47] <jemius> I'd just thought it's quite common to use Tags to change block-behavior dynamically. Hence, a block to add tags to streams would be necessary

[13:03:04] <muaddib[m]> it's kind of a mix. you can do alot with just changing variables,especially if you want a button press to do it. Tags don't usually have a lot of user interaction in my experience.
[13:03:49] *** Joins: bandnyquist (~Rheanna@218.78.99.237)
[13:04:13] <muaddib[m]> this may be bad GNURadio practice, but i hacked this together real quick. It doesn't trigger a tag, rather allows it to enter the stream. but it works. It might be getting backpressured though, like i said, just a hack.

[13:05:53] <muaddib[m]> if you're just prototyping a downstream block that handles a tag and you need to hit a button to test, i think this will work.

[18:22:34] <jemius> What should my forecast() function do if all my block's outputs always create different amounts of samples?
[18:24:28] <jemius> As I see it general_work() will always call produce() and inform the scheduler via WORK_PRODUCE_CALLED
[18:24:35] <drmpeg> Just set it to the largest it will ever need.
[18:25:32] <jemius> drmpeg, I am wondering about the parameter int noutput_items.. which output does it mean?
[18:26:10] <drmpeg> noutput_items is for all outputs.
[18:27:45] <jemius> so each output should produce *at least* noutput_items?
[18:28:21] <drmpeg> No. Each output should produce <= noutput_items.
[18:34:54] <drmpeg> Here's a recap. noutput_items is provided by the scheduler. You can use none, some or all of it.
[18:36:01] <drmpeg> forecast() allow you to get enough input item to satisfy the maximum noutput_items.
[18:36:10] <drmpeg> items
[18:36:56] <drmpeg> set_output_multiple() allows you to specify a specific multiple of noutput_items.

[23:19:51] <flash[m]> muaddib: I've been looking for a web spectral display, but when I clicked on matt_mills prototype, my Mac just froze up. Safari definitely doesn't like whatever it was doing. Still, I didn't see where the tool came from?
[23:20:17] <matt_mills[m]> https://github.com/jledet/waterfall
[23:20:30] <flash[m]> awesome. Thanks
[23:20:40] <matt_mills[m]> np, interesting that it freezes on safari
[23:20:51] <matt_mills[m]> it does try to download all ~500 grc blocks
[23:21:01] <matt_mills[m]> I've been testing on chrome
[23:21:08] <muaddib[m]> Yea, sorry should have included that flash
[23:21:37] <muaddib[m]> That’s for the web spectrum display
[23:21:47] <muaddib[m]> matt_mills: thing is for web GRC
[23:22:00] <flash[m]> it was strange; the CPU meters didn't spike, but it totally froze (except the mouse) for seconds at a time, until I closed that tab
[23:22:21] <muaddib[m]> flash[m]: on the waterfall?
[23:22:32] <matt_mills[m]> nah on my prototype page
[23:22:42] <flash[m]> yeah
[23:22:50] <flash[m]> what he said
[23:23:05] <matt_mills[m]> it should pop up a progress bar, if it's not showing that it'd probably just freeze while it's trying to download yaml files
[23:23:51] <flash[m]> I never got far enough to see anything render. I saw the progress say like 4/197 and then some 20 seconds later 140/197, after which my click to close the tab finally took
[23:24:15] <flash[m]> but there was a freeze before the progress bar, which made me think it was just a white screen :P
[23:24:49] <matt_mills[m]> ah yeah, you must be high latency from me
[23:25:04] <matt_mills[m]> there is actually 495 files it tries to load too
[23:25:19] <matt_mills[m]> dunno why it'd only get 197 of them, unless the initial directory listing got mangled
[23:25:41] <flash[m]> (I guessed)
[23:25:50] <flash[m]> my memory for numbers is non-existent
[23:25:51] <matt_mills[m]> o gotcha
[23:26:04] <matt_mills[m]> with a slow throttle applied in chrome it looks like it breaks, so there may be something I need to fix there
[23:26:15] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth)
[23:26:22] <matt_mills[m]> but the progress bar should update every 50 milliseconds
[23:27:11] <matt_mills[m]> locally it loads in < 1s, but if I throttle myself to a 3g speed it takes about 20sec
[23:27:25] <flash[m]> I clicked again, and it came right up, with a bunch of blocks on the side, no progress bar
[23:28:09] <flash[m]> I didn't expect it to be network; I have gig internet. My guess is something horrible in the Safari canvas setup?
[23:28:09] <matt_mills[m]> that might be your webbrowser caching the files it gets so they load instantly
[23:28:17] <flash[m]> yep
[23:28:50] <matt_mills[m]> ultimately I'll probably make a pre-packaged single file that has all of them,, since downloading 500 files is pretty wasteful
[23:29:02] <matt_mills[m]> but just symlinking the grc/blocks directory was fantastically easy
[23:29:10] <matt_mills[m]> I just turned on the json output for nginx autoindexes
