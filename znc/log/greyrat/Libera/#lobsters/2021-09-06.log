[03:13:45] <kline> wrl, right, but what does fuchsia have to do with linux?
[03:15:25] <kline> "we invented a whole new operating system just to escape the GPL" doesnt feel like it holds much water given that android is quite successfully maintaining an iron grip on the majority of its actual handsets despite the GPL, and making billions of dollars every year
[03:16:25] <kline> (since the only the kernel is GPL iirc in android, and the userspace is already apache, one of the licenses in use with fuchsia)
[03:16:52] <wrl> kline: the counterpoint to that is that the last thing in android that they'd need to flip the license on *is* the kernel, and fuchsia is them doing that
[03:16:53] <c355e3b> I feel like fuchsia is more of a device driver thing at this point
[03:17:02] <Church> Oh?
[03:17:29] <c355e3b> force a more stable ABI for those things
[03:17:34] <kline> wrl, i would expect that if anything, its an attempt to own the governance and direction of the kernel more than evading the GPL
[03:17:38] <c355e3b> to let phones get more updates w/o hw changes
[03:17:49] <wrl> kline: two birds one stone imo
[03:18:00] <kline> i think people overestimate the importance of the GPL
[03:18:06] <letoram> If anything Google has demonstrated that GPL is no hindernace to putting Linux in a corner and adding the proprietary stuff elsewhere, ChromeOS alone dwarfed anything else the FOSS desktop has offered.
[03:18:36] <kline> letoram, right, google has shown that the GPL really doesnt make an awful lot of difference to their business model when it comes to android/chromeos
[03:19:05] <kline> realistically most of the value in fuchsia is not license related but technological, in making an OS _specifically_ designed to work for their problems
[03:19:07] <letoram> See the USENIX keynote about rediscovering hardware.. like everyone has routed around Linux and it's the least interesting component around
[03:19:20] <kline> rather than taking a desktop unix clone and forcing it into a cell-phone shape
[03:20:04] <letoram> there's enough reasons to absolutely replace android with anything else that license doesn't register on the scale
[03:20:11] <c355e3b> I mean, I really want to deploy seastar on a project at work
[03:21:25] <kline> wrl, imo, the gpl has been both a massive step forward for foss, but a colossal failure in acheiving a free software society

[03:28:17] <kline> jabley, the issue for me is that the GPL wanted to use its position as a license to get more freedom to users, but in actual fact its mostly scared commercial software vendors away from free software completely because theyre scared of enforcement
[03:28:23] *** Joins: frtdisdrv^ (~frtdisdrv@68.101.54.227)
[03:29:19] <kline> increasingly people view the gpl as a salted-earth means to say that "i dont want commercial companies to be able to use this", which is both specifically against the intention and spirit of the license, and actually bad for end-user freedom
[03:30:50] <kline> instead we should be encouraging commercial vendors to use GPL, and for enforcement to be a constructive and cooperative effort. if we had a long case history of gpl enforcement being constructive and non-punitive i expect a lot of companies would be more willing to use it

[08:38:53] <imode> huh, I'll try that out.
[08:39:11] <imode> I just did some pruning to rule out long branches that only consist of a linear sequence of nodes.
[08:40:15] <imode> might help, might not help.
[08:41:38] <AviKav> Is it mostly serial btw?
[08:43:03] <imode> not really.
[08:44:33] <AviKav> Oooo, I can throw a quarter of a EPYC 7702P at it
[08:44:42] <AviKav> ...as soon as my friend wakes up
[08:44:47] <imode> oo.
[08:47:57] <AviKav> I have a 64GB 3700X with zram set up so I can potentially throw a multiple of my system memory at it depending on how compressible the heap is
[08:49:48] <imode> I'm actually going to re-run this with my pruning modifications.
[08:50:02] <imode> https://i.imgur.com/rhoXdvu.png
[08:50:04] <imode> here's the original.
[08:50:15] <imode> https://i.imgur.com/CA6SYbR.png
[08:50:20] <imode> here's the pruned version
[08:50:45] <imode> long linear sequences just get reduced because there's only one possible value at that point (all nodes after that node have exactly one child, so we just drill down to the leaf).
[08:52:48] <AviKav> Do you have the 500MB dot file available to grab?
[08:54:27] <imode> yeah but it'll probably not be 500mb after this.
[08:55:40] <AviKav> Also graphviz arguments. Because I've probably ran it less than half a dozen times in the last 5 years
[08:57:18] <imode> dot -Tsvg -O whatever.dot is just how I've been running it.
[08:58:37] <imode> it turned a 32k dot file down to 26k, so that's pretty neat.
[08:58:46] <imode> I wonder how the savings scales, this is a giant dot file.

[11:29:12] <enterprisey> I just deprecated something I've been supporting for nearly four years. Great feeling closing all the bug reports.
[11:29:51] <wcismylife[m]> like “sorry, decided to abandon the project instead of fixing your bug”?
[11:29:55] <enterprisey> It was the nicest sort of deprecation: there's another project that does exactly what mine did, but better, faster, with more features, and with more development resources
[11:29:58] <pnoud> Owning code is a lot like owning a boat.  The second best day is when you launch, the first is when you deprecate.
[11:30:09] <enterprisey> and they'd consulted me while writing it
[11:31:30] <badtuple> https://media.giphy.com/media/KtyTa7XH5ueJLYwmaG/giphy-downsized-large.gif
[11:32:02] <enterprisey> and it really is a strict superset of the features, so nobody's left out to dry
[11:32:32] <enterprisey> if anyone's curious (nobody is, I'm just writing this), it was the "reply" button for Wikipedia discussions
[11:32:51] <enterprisey> that's right, wikipedia discussions didn't have a "reply" button until late 2017
[11:34:35] <wink> I don't really wanna know how it's setup if you call it a thing that had to have support for years
[11:34:36] *** Joins: LordRishav (~LordRisha@user/lordrishav)
[11:34:45] <wink> but it's been over 10y since I looked at mediawiki code
[11:34:52] <enterprisey> you really, really don't, and I'm gonna tell you anyway
[11:35:09] <enterprisey> discussions were done by editing the wikitext directly - imagine holding a conversation on a google doc by typing into the google doc
[11:35:35] <wink> yeah, I mean that part was to be expected
[11:35:46] <enterprisey> you replied to someone by indenting your comment under theirs by prepending colons to your message, which increased the indentation level through a horrific abuse of the <dl> element
[11:36:22] * wink now tries to guess how many times he has replied to a comment in the last 16? years on a mediawiki
[11:36:27] <mockturtle> Simon Peyton Jones — The State of GHC [video haskell] (janus) https://lobste.rs/s/wqutyn
[11:36:54] <enterprisey> the foundation tried fixing it in 2012ish but they did it wrong and pissed the community off, so it had to wait until I got angry enough to roll my own
[11:37:22] <enterprisey> then they copied what I did, and now I'm deprecating mine in favor of theirs because they did it better and they're paid to do it
[11:38:23] *** Parts: Everything (~Everythin@37.115.210.35) ()
[11:38:46] <wink> one could argue that discussions as normal wiki pages were a mistake for any bigger wiki
[11:38:59] <enterprisey> sure
[11:39:05] <wink> sure, same code, just different NS makes for less complexity
[11:39:15] <wink> but with the first conflict in a heated discussion...
[11:39:15] <enterprisey> but this way means you can spin up ad-hoc processes and workflows and bureaucracies
[11:39:22] <enterprisey> if we had to wait for devs, it would be so bad
[11:39:37] <enterprisey> people edit-conflict like 10 times in a row sometimes
[11:39:52] <enterprisey> i.e. you save your conflict-resolved version and you hit another edit conflict message
[11:39:56] <wink> stubborn people. others might justleave
[11:40:02] <enterprisey> yeah
[11:40:10] <wink> if the medium discourages interaction, why do it
[11:40:27] <enterprisey> "thank god wikipedia works in practice, because it sure doesn't work in theory"
[11:40:34] <wink> but maybe the old-timers coming from usenet and web forums were a minority
[11:40:52] <wink> and if you come to it unbiased you might accept it
[11:41:33] <gerikson> wink: that strikes me as unlikely, considering oldtimers make a stink about how Usenet was better even now, everywhere you go ;)

[11:43:29] <mockturtle> [ Wikipedia talk:Signatures/Archive 14 - Wikipedia ] - en.wikipedia.org
[11:46:36] <epilys> I can see the headlines: "Wikipedia removes replying; bans discussion"
[11:47:11] <enterprisey> I mean, the current system for locking pages relies in large part on the workflows available to people being absolutely awflu
[11:47:15] <enterprisey> *awful
[11:47:34] <enterprisey> because if there was even a 1% rate of readers making suggestions, the moderation workload would be massive
[11:49:12] <epilys> what's stopping wikipedia from implementing a proper discussion forum? inertia? lack of initiative?
[11:49:22] <enterprisey> well they're sorta doing one now
[11:49:31] <enterprisey> but also the community goes apeshit whenever anything changes
[11:49:38] <epilys> that's good
[11:50:00] <enterprisey> in fact the ability to subscribe to discussions hit alpha this month
[11:50:59] <imode> epilys: it's a tree.
[11:51:16] <imode> so... yes?
[11:51:22] <enterprisey> a take I saw somewhere: only a programmer could think trees are how discussions should be structured
[11:51:41] <epilys> forest
[11:52:13] <enterprisey> I like imageboard (chan) threading a lot more than reddit threading, myself
[11:52:58] <wink> I have no idea what that wouldm ean
[11:53:10] <epilys> really? it's confusing for me
[11:53:11] <wink> I can positively say I've never posted on any chan
[11:53:28] <enterprisey> epilys: I got used to it pretty fast
[11:53:36] <enterprisey> it's just like a phpBB forum
[11:53:36] <epilys> wink, it's linear, sorted by timestamp
[11:53:45] <enterprisey> but more DAGgy
[11:53:59] <wink> ah
[11:54:08] <enterprisey> well, posts have numbers, and you can write the numbers at the top of your post to indicate you're replying to them
[11:54:17] <enterprisey> when you post, the numbers become links
[11:54:20] <wink> so threads like phpBB, sorted by LRU, not by popularity
[11:54:29] <epilys> ye
[11:54:34] <enterprisey> also, when someone replies to you, their post number appears, very small, on the top of your post
[11:54:44] <wink> ok, thanks
[11:54:47] <enterprisey> yeah, threads are sorted in the catalog by LRU
[11:54:49] <epilys> also lots of people posting trying to get "doubles" meaning a post number ending in repeating numbers
[11:55:01] <imode> trips.
[11:55:17] <enterprisey> some boards shit on you for calling gets (dubs)
[11:55:34] <enterprisey> I like LRU a lot more
[11:55:47] <epilys> there was this fbi document I think, with screenshots where some of the replies had (You) in them meaning they were replying to the user screenshoting the thread, which was the fbi agent
[11:55:51] <enterprisey> it's very simple and doesn't require tuning
[11:56:01] <epilys> and the agent was in lack of better terms, shitposting
[11:56:02] <enterprisey> lol
[11:56:26] <enterprisey> yeah, sometimes people write (You) out manually after the numbers to emphasize the fact that they're replying
[11:56:27] <enterprisey> as there are no likes or upvotes, replies are all you got
[11:56:40] <imode> I, too, shitpost for work.
[11:56:47] <epilys> SaaS
[11:56:57] <epilys> Shitpost as ..
[11:56:59] <enterprisey> so writing (You) could mean "despite the low quality of your post, I'm deigning to reply to it anyway"
[11:57:28] <enterprisey> (yes, "deigning" is really dubious usage, but I couldn't be bothered to fix it)
[11:58:02] <wink> i will continue my MO of staying away
[11:58:13] <enterprisey> fair
[11:58:39] <enterprisey> some day I want to set up an imageboard that has decent (rust community level) moderation
[11:58:40] <enterprisey> could be impossible, we'll see
[11:59:52] <badtuple> moderation sounds exhausting in general, and I feel like the imageboard format gives people a certain feeling of what's allowed.
[11:59:55] <epilys> I tried to do that a decade ago and people weren't interested in civilised discussion
[12:00:04] <enterprisey> badtuple: my thoughts exactly
[12:00:16] <enterprisey> I'd need to go super hardcore on automated filters, but that sorta defeats the point
[12:00:35] <epilys> badtuple, when I removed that iranian propaganda article, I felt so exhausted
[12:00:43] <enterprisey> fortunately wikipedia has a bunch (all deterministic), so I have a bit of experience in that direction
[12:00:44] <epilys> "why do I have to do this?"
[12:00:58] <enterprisey> yeah, spam would be an issue too
[12:01:20] <enterprisey> honestly not having accounts is a lot of fun but creates boatloads of problems
[12:02:23] <enterprisey> epilys: attracting the right sort of people would be really hard, and the imageboard format would strongly work against that
[12:03:26] <badtuple> I wonder what happens when accounts are anonymous. It's just a login, and it's required, but no one on the site can see it.
[12:03:32] <badtuple> Probably still terrible. But I haven't seen it before.
[12:04:18] <enterprisey> could work

[12:42:32] <Brekkjern> They only really work for me if I have already learned how something works and I need a refresher
[12:43:00] <enterprisey> as the joke goes, they're written for professional mathematicians who've developed selective amnesia targeting precisely one concept
[12:43:25] <epilys> well writing stuff is hard, let alone explaining
[12:43:53] <enterprisey> for sure. I tried writing a python tutorial but got bogged down explaining a value, let alone a variable
[12:44:46] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I've tried writing a "How to diagnose network problems" for support personell, and it's fucking impossible.
[12:45:09] <enterprisey> I once explained a linker to my parents. Well... looking back on it, I'm not sure I did anything
[12:45:41] <Brekkjern> There's just way too many things that could be wrong, and encapsulating that in a single, quick to reference document that people with little understanding can understand is an absurdly diffciult task.

[22:00:52] <kline> hm
[22:01:03] <kline> im trying to find a post, it was in the last maybe 2 years
[22:01:21] <kline> it was about finding planes/aircraft in satellite imagery/google maps with machine learning
[22:01:50] <kline> it was either here or HN, it involved them having to synthesise more training data by adding more cutout aircraft to imagery backdrops
[22:01:59] <kline> does anyone remember it/have a link to it handy?
