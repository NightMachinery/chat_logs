[00:40:13] <Aqua-> Hi, i need some live help installing Ubuntu 20.04 from live CD.
[00:40:14] <Aqua-> I am a long time ubuntu user  (since 14.04) and i usually use the stable versions as they fulfill my needs.
[00:40:14] <Aqua-> A week ago i decided to try and upgrade my OS from 20.04 to 21.10, but some error occur towards the end of the upgrade and i got a message saying the installation failed.
[00:40:15] <Aqua-> My computer restarted and it is stuck since then on the loader. I downloaded ubuntu 20.04 to my flash drive and mow i use it to post here and install the OS anew.
[00:40:15] <Aqua-> Now i've done some reading on the web, and people say one can reinstall the OS without formatting the partition, which will override only the OS folders and keep some user folders as is (for example home folder).
[00:40:16] <Aqua-> I started the insatller and got to the point where i need to manually choose what to do with the partitions.

[08:05:18] <Xuebit> Quick question to someone more knowledgable than me with Ubuntu. Why does Ubuntu utilize two different network managers?

[08:08:39] <ubottu> Xuebit: Netplan is a network configuration abstraction renderer which uses YAML descriptions of a network to work with either a NetworkManager or Systemd-networkd "renderer". More information at https://netplan.io/

[13:57:52] <Furna_> Hi I am running Ubuntu 21.10; I have succesfully recompiled my own kernel and packaged correctly. Anyway I signed it *after* installation with explicit command "sbsign" ... I was able to boot with secure boot enabled so everything is fine. Is there a way to sign the kernel image during package build instead that after installation
[13:58:01] *** Furna_ is now known as Furna
[13:59:18] <vegaga> TJ- Its booting !!! I had to use english key layout !
[13:59:22] <vegaga> Finaly !
[13:59:27] <vegaga> Thanks for your help and tutorial
[13:59:45] <lotuspsychje> Furna: is there a specific reason your compile your own kernel instead of using !mainline ones?
[13:59:49] <oerheks> Furna, did you check the site? https://ubuntu.com/blog/how-to-sign-things-for-secure-boot

[16:00:22] <mjt> oh, derr, I read VNC not RDP.
[16:00:38] <Guest4> Xrdp connects to vnc
[16:00:59] <Guest4> Basically i think some setting may need to be edited/ tweaked
[16:01:24] <Guest4> mjt can you suggest any change in tightvncserver setting?
[16:01:38] <Guest4> It listens on port 5901
[16:01:51] <mjt> not really, I had a bad experience trying get a reliable vnc server going. If you want set and forget, you could try nomachine instead...
[16:01:59] <mjt> It gives a far superior desktop experience to rdp or vnc
[16:02:03] <Guest4> Ah
[16:02:18] <mjt> as in, you can stream video over it
[16:02:31] <Guest4> It is free?
[16:02:58] <mjt> as in beer, i don't think as in licence. there's a foss version of it for sure, called opennx but might take a bit of tinkering to get going

[17:03:40] <cpach> the reason i'm asking is that the bios for this pc (Lenovo ThinkCentre M72e) seems very buggy.
[17:04:00] <oerheks> ubuntu isos are hybride mbr/uefi, so no need to force an old system

[17:06:26] <cpach> TJ-: but the installer needs to know if it should choose mbr or uefi, no? for grub

[18:43:27] <delki8> hey, honest question. I've been using ubuntu for years and I never knew how to 'proper' install a tar.gz application. I mean, I just downloaded blender, it's a tar.gz on my Downloads folder. I've extracted it and running its binary _works_.
[18:44:19] <delki8> But I'd like to put the extracted files in some place recognizable by the system, that would use the .desktop file, and be seen by the ubuntu shell as an application that can be searched
[18:45:25] <tomreyn> delki8: that's not necessarily surprising. you cannot 'install' tar.gz though, those are just archives. in your case, an archive with readily compiled source code, which happens to be comptable, apparently, to your ubuntu release.
