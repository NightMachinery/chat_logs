[00:54:41] <jcroisant> Is it possible in CHICKEN to create a SRFI-4 numeric vector that refers to an already-existing array in static memory? For example if a C library returns an array of bytes, could I wrap that in a u8vector somehow?
[01:02:39] <klovett> jcroisant: directly, w/o any memory movement? afaik, no
[01:06:51] <jcroisant> I know CHICKEN extends the SRFI-4 make-___vector procedures with the NONGC argument to allocate vectors in static memory, so I'm hoping maybe there is some hack to use some existing static memory. Or at least that it would be not too difficult to add to CHICKEN for the future. I'd like to avoid reinventing numeric vectors in Jiffi
[01:19:57] <jcroisant> Hm. Looking at the implementation of SRFI-4, it looks like it allocates a blob (bytevector), which requires the data to include a block header. So it couldn't be used with existing data without copying. Oh well
[01:24:53] <jcroisant> (I want to avoid copying so that it can be used with an array that is a member of a struct, so that modifying the numeric vector would modify the struct's memory)

[02:39:54] <Bunny351> srfi-4 vectors are record structures holding a bytevector (blob), which needs a header, so this is only possible if the external memory can be modified to hold a 1-word chicken-specific header, unfortunately
[02:40:23] <Bunny351> this could be considered a design mistake...
[02:42:06] <Corbin> Is it fixable, or are there ABI commitments?
[02:42:19] <Bunny351> it would be better if the length were stored in the record with a raw pointer to the storage, and perhaps make SRFI-4 vectors dual-typed: holding either a pointer ("external") or an internally allocated blob
[02:42:37] <Corbin> Yes! The Strategy Pattern returns again.
[02:42:54] <Bunny351> this is fixable, I'd say. I'm not sure how often internals assume the current layout (ffi, etc.)
[02:43:23] <Bunny351> you'd have a performance impact for distinguishing between both forms of allocation

[18:13:35] <sjamaan> xaltsc: I have no idea how that's supposed to work. Maybe try the chicken-users mailing list if nobody replies here

[18:33:06] <s-liao> chicken-install srfi-14
[18:33:16] <s-liao> try it firstly
[18:34:16] <xaltsc> s-liao: that works
[18:34:54] <s-liao> Then chicken-install srfi-13
[18:35:18] <xaltsc> Does work as well with CHICKEN_INCLUDE_PATH, but I cannot import them in csi
[18:36:09] <s-liao> you mean that (import srfi-14) can not work?
[18:36:15] <s-liao> in csi
[18:37:51] <xaltsc> Yep
[18:38:17] <s-liao> What is the error?
[18:38:34] <xaltsc> The error is that in the pastebin above
[18:41:15] <s-liao> How can you setup the chicken?
[18:42:44] <s-liao> You can not import any module?
[18:43:21] <xaltsc> The binary chicken ? I installed it with my distribution's pkgmanager (xbps), then in a shell, I exported the variables CHICKEN_{,INSTALL_}REPOSITORY and CHICKEN_INCLUDE_PATH to the same directory in my $HOME dir.
[18:44:17] <xaltsc> I can import r4rs
[18:45:15] <xaltsc> And scheme, (chicken base). But not srfi-14.
[18:47:02] <s-liao> Okay
[18:47:56] <xaltsc> I think the extension path might not be set properly, ,r in csi only gives the system dir.
[18:48:27] <s-liao> Yes.
[18:48:44] <s-liao> I am looking up the path in my VM.
[18:50:59] <s-liao> It is in  the path /root/.cache/chicken-install
[18:54:29] <s-liao> finally it is in the folder ../.local/lib/chicken/11
[18:55:38] <xaltsc> I have a directory $HOME/.cache/chicken-install, but my CHICKEN_* vars are set to $HOME/.local/lib/chicken/11/, where the *.so files are, and a modules.db, but no .scm files
[18:56:28] <s-liao> That is Okay.
[18:57:09] <s-liao> It might not need the *.scm files necessary.
[18:59:34] <xaltsc> chicken-status outputs nothing, maybe that's where we should look into first ?
[19:00:30] <s-liao> import does not realize the path.
[19:02:48] <xaltsc> well, it does know where to find the .so file, the first import gives this "; loading /home/ax/.local/lib/chicken/11/srfi-14.import.so ..." before erroring
[19:06:28] <xaltsc> chicken-status -cached sees the cached modules, but not the installed ones
[19:09:01] <s-liao> did you check all srfi-14* files in the folder $HOME/.local/lib/chicken/11/?
[19:09:16] <xaltsc> csi -setup-mode works when I'm ~/.local/lib/chicken/11/
[19:10:33] <xaltsc> this is the list of files in this dir http://paste.debian.net/1222445/
[19:10:49] <xaltsc> csi works even without -setup-mode when this is the cwd
[19:11:21] <s-liao> You mean that you can run (import srfi-14) by cd to ~/.local/lib/chicken/11/
[19:11:52] <s-liao> cd ~/.local/lib/chicken/11/
[19:11:59] <s-liao> Then run csi
[19:12:14] <s-liao> Then (import srfi-14)
[19:15:06] <xaltsc> Yes, it works
[19:15:29] <xaltsc> But when I cd back to, say ~, it doesn't anymore
[19:17:53] <s-liao> It is about the import command have not realized the path.
[19:18:41] <s-liao> I have a local build one of Chicken.
[19:20:51] <s-liao> All of eggs , including new install by chicken-install or built-in eggs are all in ~/.local/lib/chicken/11/ folder.
[19:21:54] <s-liao> I have to get to sleep. Next time, I can try to find out the build instruction for you.
