[00:10:50] <Samian> Disney is such a hypocrite. In one movie (Picahontas) they promote unity among different groups and this idea of love over discrimination based on origin.   However, in the lion king, they promote hating a group based merely on who they are (lions being good because they're lions and hyenas being bad because they're hyenas).
[00:10:55] <Samian> Anyone have any comment?

[12:29:34] <luminousnine> gardens*

[12:42:08] <amigojapan> Let me see
[12:42:54] <kmh_> there is also general article without that particularly new picture (apparently it is an art genre of sorts already): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_paddy_art
[12:42:54] <ro-bot-o> [url] Rice paddy art - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[12:43:22] <amigojapan> Ah yes. I have seen similar rice patty art before kmh_
[12:45:51] <luminousnine> SO how's everyone doing
[12:46:56] <amigojapan> Pretty good, thanks for asking
[12:47:19] <amigojapan> You?
[12:47:52] <chatguy> just here to discuss philosophy, religion, etc.
[12:48:28] <amigojapan> chatguy: what position do you take on religion?
[12:49:02] <chatguy> amigojapan I believe all religions contain some spiritual truth, but all religions also contain untruth. I believe some religions contain more spiritual truth than others.
[12:49:17] <chatguy> but different religions can be more or less helpful for different people.
[12:49:35] <chatguy> (regardless of their relative truth value)
[12:49:46] <amigojapan> chatguy: how did spiritual truth get scattered like that?
[12:50:27] <kmh_> chatguy, the "relative truth value" for any religion is zero
[12:50:36] <chatguy> I believe spiritual truth gets corrupted over time due to the dark entropy that predominates in this world
[12:50:40] <kmh_> hence that is not useful measure
[12:51:05] <amigojapan> chatguy: what is the true origin then?
[12:51:29] <kmh_> religion was the first attempt at science
[12:51:32] <arryana> you have some serious talent, lumi
[12:51:41] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:51:43] <chatguy> the origin of spiritual teachings is always in spiritual teachers. but usually we don't know exactly what those teachers taught. we only have records from others.
[12:51:53] <kmh_> that is an explanation for parts of the world around us
[12:51:56] <chatguy> we can judge modern spiritual teachers for ourselves. we can't do that with ancient spiritual teachers.
[12:52:32] <amigojapan> chatguy: and how do the spiritual teachers learn?
[12:52:44] <kmh_> most religions have a creation story and attempt to explain various natural phenomena, like sun, thunder & lightning, floods, etc.
[12:53:06] <spruit11> yes,  people living in huts were closer to the primal truths
[12:53:28] <chatguy> amigojapan there is of course the concept of revelation. but I would say that some people/souls are more spiritually advanced than others, and genuine spiritual teachings come from very advanced souls, that is people who have attained to high levels of divine consciousness
[12:53:31] <amigojapan> kmh_: in Japan they say demons play the drums in the sky, that explains thunder
[12:53:50] <kmh_> amigojapan,  for instance
[12:54:24] <amigojapan> chatguy: sounds like they are just making up stuff
[12:55:03] <chatguy> amigojapan that is for us to decide for ourselves. obviously many people have no spiritual inclinations and are not interested in alleged spiritual teachings. but many people do have such an interest.
[12:55:12] <kmh_> it is also notable that the actual real science (actually based on empiric data) was mostly done by priests as well
[12:55:51] <kmh_> priest noting/predicting perdiocal floods for instance, setting up the first calendar schemes
[12:56:46] <kmh_> but that's different from spiritual aspects of religion
[12:56:58] <amigojapan> kmh_: it sucks that the work week is still based on religious mumbo-jumbo
[12:57:17] <kmh_> amigojapan, well maybe
[12:57:55] <kmh_> amigojapan, you can also see it as protection from unregulated capitalism (like people having sundays off)
[12:58:03] <amigojapan> Why is the week 7 days ? "Cause God made the world in 7 days
[12:58:47] <amigojapan> kmh_: we need even more protection. But based on superstition
[12:58:58] <amigojapan> Not based*
[12:59:01] <luminousnine> Thanks arryana, but i find my talent lacking in a lot of areas
[12:59:02] <kmh_> amigojapan,  yes that's bogus, but it enforced people getting sundays off for the most part even in societies that no qualms to work their people to death otherwise
[12:59:58] <kmh_> amigojapan, yes but currently is is no alternative effective mechanism in place (in particular in the era of globalism with increasing unregulated capitalism)
[13:00:13] <amigojapan> kmh_: the Japanese government is now pushing for a 4 day work week
[13:00:29] <kmh_> amigojapan, thumbs up for that
[13:00:37] <amigojapan> Thanks
[13:01:04] <kmh_> amigojapan,  but i will believe it when i see it working out for most japanese

[13:02:20] <ro-bot-o> [url] Japan gov't backs 4-day workweek, but experts split - The Mainichi | mainichi.jp
[13:02:55] <arcturus> 4-day workweek = 80% the compensation for 100% the workload
[13:03:50] <amigojapan> arcturus: salary should not change
[13:04:38] <arryana> everyone's a work in progress, the fact that you have artistic ability at all is amazing
[13:04:58] <arcturus> what does a workweek mean in a remote working context anyway
[13:05:21] <arcturus> reachable for 4 days out of 7, but youre still expected to complete the same amount of work
[13:05:37] <amigojapan> arcturus: well if you are doing flex time it may not apply to you
[13:07:42] <amigojapan> arcturus: but many people will work on strict schedules, even on remote work
[13:08:18] <arcturus> yeah
[13:08:25] <arcturus> especially with the corporate spyware
[13:08:39] <amigojapan> Yup
[13:08:40] <arcturus> that checks if youre looking at the screen

[13:09:46] <arryana> to be fair, there's a considerable number of people who don't self-motivate very well
[13:10:12] <arryana> i worked an online job for years, ages back, and that company went through a -lot- of people who fucked off because it was remote
[13:10:47] <arryana> and i think the 80% pay thing is only in certain areas
[13:11:23] <amigojapan> Nobody said 80 precent pay in Japan
[13:11:28] <arryana> is it iceland that was working out?
[13:11:44] <arryana> i forget which country trialled it, but it was somewhere like that
[13:12:08] <arryana> saying that, there are a lot of jobs where working four days isn't viable.
[13:12:45] <arryana> and i can say for sure my other half works longer hours from home than he did from an office.
[13:13:08] <arryana> and that's often because other people working at home have not done what they need to do, and he has to clean up the mess
[13:13:34] <arcturus> Last year, a Chinese subsidiary of Japanese camera maker Canon, Canon Information Technology in Beijing, unveiled a new workspace management system that only allows smiling employees to enter the office and book conference rooms.
[13:13:44] <arcturus> Using so-called "smile recognition" technology, Canon said the system intended to bring more cheerfulness to office in the post-pandemic era.
[13:14:22] <amigojapan> Ouch, that sucks arcturus
[13:14:35] <arcturus> look what canon has done
[13:15:38] <arryana> that seems a bit draconian
[13:16:03] <arryana> but inventing something doesn't mean it will be implemented
[13:16:06] <arryana> look at google glass
[13:16:52] <arcturus> imho, it has to be applied on teachers
[13:16:56] <arcturus> theyre always grumpy
[13:17:22] <arcturus> they shouldnt be allowed in the classroom if theyre going to yell at kids
[13:17:56] <arryana> i have never seen a teacher 'yell at kids'
[13:18:55] <amigojapan> arcturus: we should boycott canon
[13:19:05] <arcturus> for sure
[13:19:13] <arcturus> its got to be nikon or fujifilm now
[13:19:43] <arcturus> sony, ricoh, pentax or even konica-minolta

[14:13:03] <arryana> i know quite a few teachers, and every one of them is looking for a new career.  they say teaching now is more a job of babysitting than teaching.
[14:13:13] <arryana> and that's really unfortunate for all of us.
[14:14:49] <pussipupu> Hmm, that's not what I hear from the teachers I know
[14:15:40] <arryana> i'm very glad.
[14:15:54] <arryana> it may well be a cultural issue
[14:16:28] <arryana> all but one of them are teachers in the states, and they say that the parents are the bigger problem.  it has become impossible to set expectations when everyone's kid is the 'exception'
[14:18:26] <pussipupu> All the teachers I know are friends and family from England, so could well be partly that

[14:24:12] <arryana> my english teacher friend used to teach little kids, but finally left because so many weren't housebroken.
[14:24:47] <arryana> technically here a kid has to be out of diapers before going to school, but in practice they were needing to be changed because parents weren't entirely honest

[21:31:46] <Samian> Google needs a lesson in philosophy because Google confuses the means with the ends.
[21:33:14] <Samian> means and ends are a dichotomy I read about in philosophy. I hear this subject discussed most by philosophers. So it must be one of those topics that fits comfortably under the general philosophy embrella
[21:34:01] <pussipupu> *umbrella
[21:34:02] <pussipupu> what confusion do you see?
[21:51:45] <plank> samian googlers themselves are decently versed in philosophy. you can see it in their internal discussions

[23:35:08] <Ungwelian> Some kind of facsimile-IRC for people who like colours and sounds.
[23:36:45] <pussipupu> I like colours and sounds
[23:37:06] <pussipupu> Colours like tabby, and sounds like meow
[23:37:22] <blkshp> What about coloured sounds?
[23:37:32] <TechTest> the sound of purring is better than meows :)
[23:37:35] <Ungwelian> I'm sure there are those as well :)
[23:37:41] <TechTest> blkshp: what?
[23:37:42] <pussipupu> not a big fan of pink noise

[23:38:17] <TechTest> blkshp: huh, do you also have that?
[23:38:22] <blkshp> No
[23:38:43] <blkshp> But i have an overall reasonable general knowledge.
[23:38:58] <TechTest> hmm
[23:39:13] <blkshp> Especially if it's on star trek :P
[23:39:25] <TechTest> sounds like valuable knowledge
[23:39:38] <blkshp> Pointless.
[23:39:42] <TechTest> and you posted about synesthesia like yesterday
[23:39:50] <blkshp> Like 3 weeks ago
[23:39:53] <TechTest> so yes, I know :P
[23:39:57] <TechTest> yesterday
[23:40:08] <blkshp> Then why did you say "what"?
[23:40:08] <TechTest> check your logs lol
[23:40:32] <TechTest> I didn't make the connection to "colored sounds"
[23:40:32] <blkshp> No cause I don't care xD
[23:40:40] <blkshp> Well you should have.
[23:40:43] <blkshp> :P

[23:40:53] <blkshp> No.
[23:40:58] <blkshp> It's inconclusive.

[23:48:11] * blkshp puts another negative point on TechTest's score sheet.
[23:48:11] <TechTest> you posted that on Sunday
[23:48:23] <blkshp> Yes, that's hyperphantasia not synesthesia.
[23:48:48] <TechTest> dude, you don't even remember what you were reading :P
[23:49:07] <blkshp> Synesthesia is where you can hear smells or see sounds or taste colours
[23:49:24] <TechTest> correct
[23:49:36] <TechTest> (the statement is correct, uou are wrong)
[23:50:59] <blkshp> Oh, i didn't even notice it had synesthesia in it.
[23:51:06] <blkshp> I didn't actually read it all lol
[23:51:47] <blkshp> OK... technically you are correct that i mentioned it but not the right day so we're back to where we were a few minutes ago with you still being wrong and that 'wrong' is absolute and you're wrong about someone being wrongerer than the other lol.
