[00:00:25] <causative> psychologists today rely on sophisticated statistics to find trends - increasingly sophisticated now, because the replication crisis has led them to look for more sound methods than simple hypothesis testing

[00:02:03] <causative> these things are relatively new in the practice of psychology - Freud's contemporaries were not doing them
[00:03:19] <causative> the replication crisis in social sciences is a result of poor mathematical rigor; researchers made up what sounded good and would be amazing if true, and many built their careers on falsehoods, all because the statistical rigor was not there
[00:03:37] <causative> and yes, that made what they did less legitimate

[00:04:14] <Delf> Why are you so obsessed with truth?
[00:04:44] <I_Am_M00t> love, not truth!
[00:05:17] <Delf> s/truth/love/
[00:05:17] <ro-bot-o> Delf meant to say: Why are you so obsessed with love?
[00:06:50] <causative> it's just the way the human brain works - we take action based on what we believe, and the more accurate our beliefs, the better our actions help optimize what we want
[00:06:59] <causative> we want truth because truth helps us get what we want
[00:07:41] <causative> some also develop, beyond this, an interest in truth for its own sake
[00:08:38] <causative> truth is often valuable towards achieving your goals down the line, even if you don't know it at the time you discover the truth - it helps to have a bias towards finding out more truth
[00:09:32] <causative> as a result of that, evolution gave us all this bias towards finding out truth for its own sake - some more than others
[00:09:49] <causative> curiosity
[00:09:50] <I_Am_M00t> evolution made us social
[00:10:19] <causative> well, many social instincts conflict with the truth; see https://pastebin.com/WQVZJZeW

[00:10:37] <I_Am_M00t> yes, love > truth for the human organism
[00:10:47] <causative> "social" doesn't mean "love"
[00:10:52] <I_Am_M00t> truth is only interesting once your needs are met
[00:10:54] <wasd> how about “the doctrine of not-one-side.” aka Anekantavada?  Sure we should be carefuly not to slip into absolutism.  Even statements like "finding out truth" suggest there is a one and only truth to be found!
[00:10:55] <causative> it often means hate - exclusion of outgroups
[00:10:57] <I_Am_M00t> social = eternal love
[00:11:15] <causative> social media has amplified our connection and our communication, and has the result been more love, or more hate?
[00:11:26] <I_Am_M00t> no it hasn't
[00:11:28] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[00:11:35] <I_Am_M00t> it has weakened it
[00:12:06] <causative> objectively, it has put people in more frequent communication with a large number of other people
[00:12:19] <I_Am_M00t> you're quite the rhetorician
[00:12:24] <I_Am_M00t> "objectively"
[00:12:33] <causative> well, that is objective
[00:12:39] <I_Am_M00t> that's not the point though... is it?
[00:12:45] <causative> it's something we could potentially measure, and it's obviously true
[00:12:47] <I_Am_M00t> that's what makes your rhetoric seductive
[00:13:11] <I_Am_M00t> you state a fact that is true... but is the larger picture you're drawing true? that social media has made humanity more... social
[00:13:45] <Samian> causative  it's a shame I can't duel to defend my honor against unworthy foes
[00:13:49] <I_Am_M00t> see... and now you want me to have this little battle with you, after you've laid out this misleading statement
[00:13:59] <I_Am_M00t> putting in energy to play your game
[00:14:10] <I_Am_M00t> no thx
[00:14:11] <causative> if it's misleading then you should counter it with another statement that you can objectively justify
[00:14:48] <causative> "people committing genocide" is a particular case of the general case of "people being social"
[00:15:23] <causative> being social is about associating with others like you, and excluding those unlike you, so that those like you get more resources and those unlike you are pushed away and weakened
[00:15:44] <wasd> music festivals seem more social (and could be used to measure increased love / hate).  I'd go with love.
[00:16:22] <wasd> FB: Jenna has poked you.  "oh look, it's that girl from high school".  Doesn't, on the surface, appear more social.
[00:16:38] <causative> in a music festival everybody is listening to the musicians
[00:16:41] <wasd> but 'more' than what?  meeting for coffee?  never speaking?
[00:16:51] <wasd> all seems rather subjective! :)
[00:16:55] <causative> at a music festival, people mostly talk to people they already know, or listen to the musicians
[00:16:58] <I_Am_M00t> love > truth for the human organism
[00:17:03] <causative> so it is kind of social but it's not like a conference
[00:17:13] <I_Am_M00t> we aren't truth seekers, we seek people, connections, mending of mind
[00:17:21] <I_Am_M00t> otherwise we go nutso
[00:17:23] <causative> anyway I guess the point is moot, there are other events that are more social and do lead to "love" that you could point to
[00:17:35] <causative> but there are also other events that lead the opposite way
[00:17:45] <causative> some people gather to love - some people gather to hate
[00:17:46] <I_Am_M00t> truth seeking is a luxury
[00:18:17] <I_Am_M00t> and it's only sought in the most limited fashion, such as highly compartmentalized science
[00:19:16] <I_Am_M00t> usually for some utilitarian purpose
[00:19:16] <wasd> what's the proposition?  people seek truth vs people seek social connection?
[00:19:25] <I_Am_M00t> no idea
[00:19:29] <wasd> :)
[00:19:30] <I_Am_M00t> something about truth vs emotion
[00:19:45] <wasd> people will lie to maintain social connection so that could be a clue.
[00:19:47] <causative> truth is good - lies are bad
[00:19:56] <I_Am_M00t> not according to the human organism
[00:19:58] <causative> it's not about what most people do
[00:20:26] <causative> lies lead to injustice
[00:20:28] <I_Am_M00t> truth is not good, lies are not bad
[00:20:29] <Delf> I'm curious but I'm not obsessing about truth
[00:20:33] <I_Am_M00t> that's a value judgment
[00:20:38] <wasd> good / bad are subjective though?
[00:20:39] <causative> a criminal will lie to escape just punishment
[00:20:40] <I_Am_M00t> value judgments lie within our emotional reasoning
[00:21:04] <I_Am_M00t> truth/lies are not within the "space" of good/bad
[00:21:08] <Delf> I_Am_M00t: Not for me
[00:21:12] <I_Am_M00t> they have nothing to do with morals
[00:21:18] <causative> yes they do
[00:21:20] <I_Am_M00t> no they don't
[00:21:35] <causative> imagine someone at a rally getting fired up and angry about some imagined crimes by a minority
[00:21:36] <I_Am_M00t> morals come into play when you don't know how things are objectively
[00:21:40] <causative> the crimes weren't real, but the anger is real
[00:21:47] <causative> he got angry because of a falsehood
[00:21:54] <causative> and that's wrong
[00:21:54] <I_Am_M00t> that kinda talk is what the Bible sells people, that there is objective truth
[00:22:06] <wasd> "that's wrong"?
[00:22:08] <causative> truth is not what an authority says
[00:22:23] <I_Am_M00t> assigning good/bad to truth/falsehood is a dangerous game
[00:22:43] <causative> don't think that science is like the Bible - the Bible is all about obedience to authority, trust in authority, believing what authority says
[00:22:55] <I_Am_M00t> science is not as developed as people claim it is
[00:23:00] <Delf> Believing in truth...
[00:23:01] <causative> the Bible is not about finding things out
[00:23:08] <I_Am_M00t> it is highly utilitarian, it's not for "finding things out" in the broadest sense
[00:23:09] <causative> it's not about curiosity and seeking
[00:23:15] <I_Am_M00t> it's merely for creating technology for limited purposes
[00:23:54] <causative> you wouldn't find many scientists who agree with that claim, I_Am_M00t
[00:24:14] <causative> astronomers don't do what they do so that we can make better telescopes or something
[00:24:21] <causative> they do it because it's fascinating and grand
[00:24:35] <Delf> No. They do it so that we don't have to.
[00:24:41] <causative> no one *has* to
[00:24:53] <causative> very little of astronomy will ever have a practical impact on Earth in the next hundred or thousand years
[00:24:59] <Delf> No, but if someone doesn't do it we're all fucked.
[00:25:03] <wasd> understanding the fundamental nature of reality, is probably high up in the list.
[00:25:12] <causative> science is first about discovery, not technology
[00:25:39] <wasd> probably depends on your definition.
[00:25:43] <causative> "hey look at this cool shell I found! I wonder if there's more of them over there?" That's the kind of thing science concerns itself with
[00:25:46] <I_Am_M00t> science is about technology, not discovery
[00:26:04] <I_Am_M00t> cool story bro, nice rewrite of reality
[00:26:10] <Delf> Hahahh
[00:26:16] <causative> oh so now you do care about Truth?
[00:26:21] <wasd> The hundreds of teams looking for the 'next EV battery breakthrough' are probably looking at the $, or at least the fame.
[00:26:21] <I_Am_M00t> nope
[00:26:23] <causative> upset that I'm rewriting "reality"?
[00:26:26] <I_Am_M00t> i still prefer good emotions
[00:26:47] <Delf> Good emotions?
[00:26:47] <I_Am_M00t> truth is secondary to humans, that's how it is
[00:27:00] <causative> humans have moral value only because of our sapience
[00:27:14] <wasd> wtf does that mean?
[00:27:19] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[00:27:21] <causative> meerkats can love - but they do not have as much moral value because they do not have as much sapience
[00:27:28] <causative> bonobos love more than humans do
[00:27:37] <I_Am_M00t> what is happening
[00:27:47] <I_Am_M00t> apples are red, sometimes yellow
[00:27:50] <causative> what makes humans humans, is our sapience, our ability to find the truth
[00:27:53] <Delf> Does that mean I have less sapience than you?
[00:28:33] <bittersweetsymph> Some do not care about the truth
[00:28:38] <causative> we don't mind if we smash up a gear, or smash up a computer, or a washing machine - because these things have no sapience, they do not have understanding, they do not grasp the truths of their existence, so it is not wrong to destroy them
[00:28:47] <wasd> I'm not convinced we're as great as people make out.  How many animal languages have we learnt, compared to the other way around?
[00:28:55] <Delf> bittersweetsymph: Yes, I for example. This is the truth
[00:29:01] <causative> we do mind if we smash up a human, because a human has sapience, the human knows what you're doing to him, he grasps the truths of his existence, so it is wrong to destroy them
[00:29:45] <causative> it's not primarily because he loves - animals love as well, but we do not grant them the same moral status as humans
[00:29:54] <bittersweetsymph> Some people do not mind of they hurt other humans
[00:30:07] <Delf> Or animals...
[00:30:21] <wasd> "we" being you, I'm guessing.
[00:30:40] <causative> people who aren't psychopaths
[00:30:57] <Delf> I'm not... but I have no moral
[00:31:50] <wasd> There are many people and many different beliefs.  Take the monks who will not de-flea their dogs because it will kill the fleas.  Who take care not to step on a single creature as they walk.  All like being sacred.
[00:32:39] <causative> even those monks would value a human life over that of an insect, or ten insects, would he not?
[00:32:42] <wasd> Or the guy who'll physically assault someone for damaging their vehicle.
[00:33:03] <Delf> Or the guy that kills another human because they hurt a cat
[00:33:12] <wasd> yep
[00:33:29] <causative> people have a lot of different views on morality, different specific instantiations
[00:33:42] <causative> but non-psychopaths agree that a human has more moral value than a washing machine or a cat
[00:33:46] <wasd> "we" isn't really so absolute.  I'm going to assume every time you talk as if it refers to all of humanity, you really mean yourself.
[00:33:59] <Delf> Washing machine maybe. Cat? Never.
[00:34:12] <causative> would you kill two cats if it was the only way to save a human life?
[00:34:25] <Delf> I'd kill 10 humans to save a half cat.
[00:34:33] <wasd> Weren't they worshipped as gods in ancient egypt, or did I make that up?
[00:34:41] <wasd> Surely a god is worth more than a human!
[00:35:05] <wasd> while we're at it, doesn't it matter if it's an 'important' human or just a regular one?

[00:35:16] <causative> “Though it is hard to say the Egyptians thought one thing or another, since so much change happened across their 3,000+ years of history, the ancient Egyptians, in general, did not worship animals,”
[00:35:31] <wasd> You're missing the point.
[00:35:51] <Delf> I'd say causative just had a cup of coffee.
[00:36:18] <Ungwelian> That's probably true :)
[00:36:27] <causative> in general, 99% of people value human lives over animal lives
[00:36:32] <causative> there are some contrarians
[00:36:44] <causative> but on the whole, that's the consensus
[00:36:46] <wasd> The absolute pyramid of importance doesn't exist, much like absolute truth.
[00:37:21] <Ungwelian> I think there's many objective truths, and there's also many ways to them.
[00:37:55] <Delf> Do they cancel out each other too?
[00:38:14] <causative> wasd, but *you yourself* do in fact value some things over others, do you not?
[00:38:27] <Ungwelian> I don't think they do. But people sometimes speak about them in ways that seem contradictory.

[00:38:54] <I_Am_M00t> we care about survival, and as long as what we consider reality allows us to survive, we're fine
[00:38:58] <wasd> You might like that one ;)
[00:39:12] <I_Am_M00t> truth is just a story we tell, it's a unicorn
[00:39:14] <Ungwelian> For example, you can have objective truths about knitting a sweater.
[00:39:26] <wasd> "It has been prompted by the emergence of vigilante cow-protection mobs, who have been murdering Muslims over suspicions they have been eating beef."
[00:39:44] <causative> well, people murdering out-group members is nothing new
[00:39:53] <causative> doing it over eating beef is just an excuse
[00:39:58] <Ungwelian> causative might say that when you use sweater knitting forms, they are mathematical truths.
[00:40:08] <causative> certainly Ungwelian
[00:40:22] <Ungwelian> But then there's also the truth about how you use your hands.
[00:40:25] <causative> mathematical patterns - Feynman has a quote about the mathematical patterns in knitting
[00:40:30] <Ungwelian> Experiential sense-muscle knowledge.
[00:40:31] <wasd> Which is more important.  The cow or the humans?
[00:41:12] <causative> yes Ungwelian although we should be careful here - because what if the person is inexperienced, bad at knitting?  Are their hand-motions still truths?
[00:41:13] <Ungwelian> And there's other truths too. Like at what time it's personally good to knit, usually.
[00:41:33] <causative> it's still a truth that they *use* those hand-motions, but the hand-motions are not the "true" hand-motions of proper knitting
[00:41:58] <causative> truth is an ideal - an endpoint that we often fall short of.  It's not whatever we currently have, believe, or do.
[00:42:47] <Ungwelian> That sounds a bit platonic. Like there's an ideal form of knitting somewhere.
[00:42:58] <causative> there are better and worse forms of knitting
[00:43:04] *** Inline_ is now known as Inline
[00:43:09] <causative> better forms of knitting are motivated by better understandings of the truths of knitting
[00:43:22] <Ungwelian> They're all relative and personal.
[00:43:23] <wasd> anyway, moot is correct I think.  survival comes first.  hence the moral difference between stealing to eat vs stealing for profit / drugs / fun.
[00:43:36] *** Quits: gb73d (~gb73d@host-92-7-42-10.as13285.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:43:49] <causative> survival does not always come first wasd ; some people kill themselves, or sacrifice their lives for the lives of others
[00:44:14] <Ungwelian> With grand truths, it's really important not to forget that a forest is composed of trees.
[00:44:25] <causative> Ungwelian, they may be relative and personal but it is still possible to knit better or worse.  Just because this is the way you knit now, doesn't mean it's the right way.
[00:44:39] <causative> you may gain experience and learn a better way
[00:44:48] <causative> and you would judge with hindsight that the way you knit before was worse
[00:44:51] *** Quits: mei3 (~mei@user/mei) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[00:45:31] <causative> knitting motions are not exactly truth, though - but they are *motivated* by truths.
[00:45:45] <Ungwelian> Value judgements should be made with compassion and situational awareness.
[00:46:09] <causative> or by beliefs, and we get better at knitting when we replace false beliefs about knitting with true ones
[00:46:09] <causative> we get better at anything when we replace false beliefs about that thing with true ones
[00:47:38] <Delf> Too much boolean work
[00:47:40] <causative> Ungwelian, "situational awareness" is another word for "awareness of the truth"
[00:47:46] <Ungwelian> Then there's also the truth that sometimes, perfectionism is bad for you.
[00:48:31] <Delf> I_Am_M00t: What is good emotions?
[00:48:32] <causative> all decisions should be made with maximal relevant awareness of the truth
[00:48:57] <Delf> This is all nice, but your view of truth is problematic
[00:49:03] <Delf> Otherwise, there's no problems
[00:50:07] <causative> yes, correct Ungwelian
[00:50:07] <causative> truth is the limiting ideal - what we wish we could have, even if it's not always practical to get it

[00:51:47] <causative> truth is good, our social behaviors often come into conflict with the truth, and where they do come into conflict with the truth, they cause harm overall
[00:52:17] <causative> lies breed injustice and weakness of society
[00:52:17] <Delf> Truth cause harmful social behaviour too
[00:52:29] <causative> truths are only harmful when combined with falsehoods
[00:52:46] <Delf> Lies!
[00:53:44] <causative> well, it's an extreme statement, but I'd say that even our different value systems are the result of our different beliefs, and if we all knew the truth we would share the same value system as well
[00:54:09] <Delf> You don't get to fuck around with truth... without the attached poisoned behaviour
[00:54:26] <causative> you notice that e.g. Muslims and Christians, some of whom hate each other, hate each other because they disagree on certain religious beliefs - and if they agreed on these beliefs their hate would also go away
[00:54:39] <Delf> Not all
[00:54:44] <causative> most of it, at least
[00:54:57] <Delf> Not enough of it. Too little of amount
[00:54:59] <causative> if they agreed on *the truth* they wouldn't be Muslims or Christians in the first place
[00:55:09] <causative> they'd be part of the same ideological group

[00:56:36] <causative> every dictator builds his empire on lies
[00:56:49] <Delf> Eh...not me
[00:57:06] <causative> the criminal lies about his crimes to prevent his just punishment, the brown-noser lies about his achievements to advance unjustly ahead of his peers
[00:57:20] <causative> the oppressive state lies to the people about how great it is for them
[00:57:30] <Delf> Of course
[00:57:34] <Delf> Deception...
[00:57:46] <Delf> Ultimately because they're afraid...
[00:58:03] <Delf> They're afraid of each other. Afraid of what can be done to them so they oppress and suppress another.

[01:03:44] <wasd> "truth is good".  "which truth?".  "THE truth".
[01:03:51] <apotheon> Perhaps you should explain so that, when you say "truth", we don't all assume you're talking about the wrong thing.

[01:06:15] <wasd> Surely the deluded believe honestly in what they believe.  How could you know we aren't all deluded?

[01:09:15] <Delf> I see truth as a mental pattern that tries to self-replicate at the cost of your cognitive functions. Truth is a subfunction of our orientation capabilities.. but it's gotten fed with anabola.
[01:10:03] <Delf> It attaches to our emotions and uses our emotions against us preventing us from learning and understanding
[01:11:07] <apotheon> "anabola"
[01:11:11] <apotheon> Anabolic steroids?
[01:11:17] <Delf> We get drained and aggressive.. we try to protect the truth from being dissolved by other or ourselves
[01:11:20] <Delf> Yes
[01:12:19] <apotheon> It kinda seems like you're describing something most people would call "belief" or "faith".
[01:12:44] <apotheon> . . . and leaving what most people would call "truth" without a word to refer to it.
[01:13:14] <Delf> All the same... faith and belief are different facets of the same shite
[01:13:26] <apotheon> or doctrine
[01:13:47] <Delf> Whichever you like. Or reality.
[01:13:53] <apotheon> What term would you have people use for what we'd otherwise call "truth", then, if you'd have us use the word "truth" to refer roughly to doctrine?
[01:14:20] <Delf> Why would I want people to use a different term?
[01:14:30] <apotheon> . . . to communicate, presumably.

[01:15:08] <Delf> We communicate just fine using the same word. Our understanding differ and it will with most other things too, more and less
[01:15:13] <apotheon> Given your usage of the term "truth", others cannot intelligibly speak to you on your terms about what other people would call "truth".
[01:15:40] <apotheon> Do you not differentiate between what one claims and what simply is whether anyone claims it or not?
[01:16:20] <Delf> What simply is would be in accordance with another one's claim
[01:16:36] <apotheon> not if that other didn't claim it

[01:17:14] <Delf> Err.. not familiar with that
[01:17:31] <apotheon> several blind men use sense of touch to examine an elephant and describe it
[01:17:45] <apotheon> they get into a fight over whether it's more like a snake, a tree trunk, et cetera

[01:23:13] <Inline> yah, you can navigate
[01:23:27] <apotheon> The idea of perspective implies there's a single thing (e.g. the elephant) and people see different aspects of it (trunk, leg, ear).
[01:23:30] <Delf> I don't do truth
[01:23:32] <Inline> so it's not static either, but it's perceived as if static
[01:24:01] <Inline> well that was the most basic example
[01:24:02] <apotheon> In that analogy, the elephant is truth, and the blind men's perspectives are beliefs based on apprehending only part of the truth.
[01:24:17] <Inline> you look at a stone (not the same as the other stone)
[01:24:26] <Inline> he looks at another entirely different stone
[01:24:50] <Inline> so as long as you look at stones there's a chance you'll meet
[01:24:51] <apotheon> I'm getting the impression that what Delf is saying is more like multitidinous solipsism.
[01:24:54] <Inline> or not at all

[01:26:52] <apotheon> Even if that's the case, though, there's still something more fundamental that could be called "truth" behind what Delf seems to want to call "truth", so we still haven't gotten anywhere.
[01:27:01] <Inline> now you both look at totally different things, it's improbable that you'll meet but still you can communicate that to some extent (by way of describing the things you look at, you don't know what at or how the other is looking)
[01:27:09] <wasd> I've always quite liked the elephant story.
[01:27:13] <apotheon> That more fundamental "truth" would be the fact of multitudinous solipsism.
[01:27:29] <Inline> simply put truth doesn't exist
[01:27:32] <apotheon> wasd: It's certainly useful!
[01:27:41] <apotheon> Inline: What does exist?
[01:28:32] <Delf> Truth is not an actual thing, it's a suitcase term..
[01:28:38] <Inline> no idea what, but certainly not truth
[01:28:50] <Inline> yah Delf++
[01:29:50] <apotheon> Inline: You're making a truth claim when you claim truth does not exist.
[01:30:07] <apotheon> "the truth is that truth does not exist" is the substance of your claim
[01:30:13] <Inline> I do
[01:30:33] <apotheon> That essentially removes you from discussion of truth.
[01:30:45] <wasd> 10 + 10 = 20 or 100?  Was it base 10 or base 2?  Either way, there is a base 10 and a base 2, isn't there?  I don't think you can just dismiss all of reality with "it does not exist".
[01:30:52] <Inline> that removes me from the flat earthers static env
[01:31:07] <apotheon> Delf: That's the most sensible thing I think I've gotten from what you've said -- that it's a suitcase term.  Do you care to elaborate on what you mean by that?
[01:31:14] <Inline> what is a paradox for the flatlanders is a flip-flop machine for the non-flatlander
[01:31:40] <apotheon> Inline: How can you say a "flat-earther" is wrong if there is no truth?
[01:31:41] <Inline> hence the dynamics
[01:31:47] <apotheon> No truth means no falsehood, either.
[01:31:49] <Delf> apotheon: If you draw a mind map... it might become easier
[01:32:09] <apotheon> Falsehood is statement of that which is not truth, and with no truth there is no standard for that which is not truth.
[01:32:30] <apotheon> Delf: Is that an evasion?  It doesn't get me anywhere.
[01:32:51] <wasd> Is it time to say something like: "this sentence is false"
[01:32:55] <apotheon> I think I'm dealing with woo-woo obscurantism.  I recognize no genuine efforts to communicate.
[01:32:56] <Delf> No, I'm struggling with trying to explain to you in a way that you can understand
[01:33:01] <apotheon> wasd: probably
[01:34:04] <trbp> as always it is all about definition people need kind of normatives and lacking some they invent some so they can agree that something is true red sweet or awful
[01:34:11] <apotheon> Delf: You haven't actually said anything about what you mean beyond the initial comment(s).  I've had to poke at you with questions to get you to just continually, and in new ways, deny that my attempts to interpret your words are representative of your meaning.  Perhaps you could try actual explanations if you want to explain.

[01:34:33] <Delf> Truth is backed up by things such as belief, faith... reality. Those all are sub functions of our orientation capabilities
[01:34:50] <trbp> and those normatives are natural result of trying to communicate
[01:35:05] <Delf> Like your sensory capability... to feel texture... your eyes, to perceive a feed
[01:35:18] <apotheon> In my use of the term "truth", belief, faith, and so on, are *about* truth, but often wildly incompatible with it, much like a lie could be incompatible with an honest statement.
[01:35:47] <apotheon> Reality, without qualifiers, is meanwhile that which is true about what exists, in a manner of speaking.
[01:36:15] <trbp> Delf: because of you have them you naturally get aware of others and further on try to exchange/communicate building up normatives
[01:36:21] <apotheon> Saying "truth is a sub-function of our orientation capabilities", you're making a claim about "truth" that may or may not be true.
[01:36:29] <trbp> btw. as we all know what is true today can be false tomorrow

[01:37:03] <apotheon> From what I've seen so far, it would be a false claim, because you're saying things that seem to indicate that one could not even say your comment about truth is true using your definition of truth.
[01:38:22] <apotheon> If you're not telling me the truth (as I understand the term), then you seem to be telling me lies, a story, or nothing at all.
[01:38:33] <Delf> No... I'm honest
[01:38:36] <apotheon> Is it truly what you understand?
[01:38:47] <apotheon> No, because "something something truth".

[01:45:45] <apotheon> It's dishonest, when done deliberately, and simply pointless otherwise.
[01:46:58] <Inline> yes it's comfortable and also the most accurate when it comes to pinning stuff but with it comes with  its limit, hence when you have to go beyond some paradoxes you have to leave that terrain
[01:47:09] <Delf> Did you just accuse me of dishonesty, apotheon?

[02:12:43] <Delf> So I do not do... computer with a compute capable graphics card
[02:13:03] *** Joins: Brainium (~brainium@user/brainium)
[02:13:26] <Delf> I look at the structures of things, the way they behave
[02:14:13] <wasd> wait, what structure?  What things?  I thought there was no reality at all?
[02:14:26] <wasd> How could there be things or structure?
[02:14:31] <Delf> Reality, truth, religion, faith, belief. These are all interconnected things and are functions of navigation. I avoid all those functions. It's like taking out the compute capable graphics card out of your computer and using one that does not compute.
[02:14:45] *** Awaru- is now known as Awaru
[02:15:12] <Delf> I don't compute. You can't make me.
[02:15:45] <Ungwelian> Why do you avoid them, though?
[02:15:54] <wasd> so, navigation is some superset?  "I avoid..." means, discussion in those terms or something else?
[02:15:58] <Delf> Because they have adverse effects on my behaviour
[02:16:30] <Delf> I have much less mental resources than you have so I'm forced to prioritize better
[02:16:31] <Ungwelian> Why not make peace with them and learn to coexist cooperatively?
[02:16:50] <Ungwelian> Oh.
[02:16:57] <Delf> I cannot have my mental resources occupied with trying to defend things such as reality, truth, belief, faith and all the other horse shit. I don't need it
[02:17:39] <wasd> I'm not sure reality needs defending though.  It'll be fine, with or without anyones belief in it :)
[02:17:57] <Delf> My brains.. and I'm sure yours also, is designed to defend these things. But you probably have enough brains to do other things simultaneously.. Me not so much
[02:18:24] <Delf> Reality the way you understand it, not reality as an actual thing.
[02:18:35] <wasd> I think reality is an actual thing.
[02:18:51] <Delf> Yaa of course you do, and you'll defend it too.. even if it wasn't an actual thing

[02:19:19] <wasd> Why "of course".  Plenty of people don't.
[02:19:25] <Ungwelian> The Ishta-Devas can certainly trap you :)
[02:19:37] <Delf> Who is vas is dast?
[02:19:44] <Delf> Ishta-Devas?
[02:19:52] <Ungwelian> Godheads, approximately.
[02:20:02] <Ungwelian> Social, godlike terms.
[02:20:09] <Ungwelian> With vast social power.
[02:20:33] <Delf> Like Elon?
[02:20:46] <Ungwelian> Like reality, truth, belief, faith.
[02:21:03] <Delf> Ehh... You're all trapped with me.
[02:21:09] <Ungwelian> Haha :D
[02:21:31] <Ungwelian> I find that the Ishta-Devas can be great tools, too.
[02:21:46] <Delf> Example?
[02:21:52] <Ungwelian> Politics.
[02:22:02] <Delf> Holy shit.. I'm not a fan of politics
[02:22:04] <wasd> Defence of reality seems like such an absurd term.
[02:22:24] <wasd> "all other possibilities of it NOT being an actual thing".  Such as?
[02:22:24] <Ungwelian> Everyone hates politics :)
[02:22:36] <apotheon> Ungwelian: Your use of "Ishta-Devas" seems similar to Max Stirner's use of Geists, but with different connotations.
[02:22:44] <Delf> wasd: Such as we don't fucking know
[02:23:07] <Ungwelian> apotheon, oh. How does he use the term?
[02:23:12] <Delf> Ungwelian: But you find it to be great tool?
[02:23:13] <apotheon> somewhat pejoratively
[02:23:14] <wasd> So, we could summarise as "reality is made up because we don't fucking know.  Don't talk to me about it."?
[02:23:32] <Ungwelian> Delf, I think it's about cohabitation. I mean, it's like dirty dishes.
[02:23:41] <apotheon> I can understand the desire to use a pejorative term, but I think that's a bit reductionist.
[02:23:53] <Ungwelian> The best thing is to accept it and start washing the dishes.
[02:24:00] <apotheon> Ungwelian: I prefer the way you characterized Ishta-Devas.
[02:24:01] <Delf> wasd: No, it's a thing we assume to be something despite what we think of it
[02:24:09] <thunder> how about egregore?
[02:24:14] <apotheon> 22:53 < Ungwelian> The best thing is to accept it and start washing the dishes.
[02:24:17] <apotheon> Buddhist?
[02:24:19] <Ungwelian> Thanks. I may have been inspired by Durkheim a bit :)
[02:24:38] <Ungwelian> Oh god forbid, not a Buddhist, unless used in a Gandhian way.
[02:24:38] <apotheon> "How do I find nirvana?"  "When you finish lunch, wash your bowl."
[02:24:40] <Delf> Ungwelian: I suppose.... with a dishwasher
[02:24:43] <wasd> We had -> "There is no truth because it is irrelevant and self-disolving, like reality, but it isn't all my dream.  It may be a dream."
[02:24:45] <thunder> the term egregore is already used in these contexts. similar to meme.
[02:24:52] <Ungwelian> Delf, definitely with a dishwasher.
[02:24:54] <apotheon> Egregore is also a great term.
[02:25:07] <wasd> And that definitely turned into "I don't want to talk about, mmm k"
[02:25:14] <Delf> wasd: Let me share with you my definition of free will. It will do a good example
[02:25:23] <wasd> A definition!
[02:25:25] <wasd> Please :)
[02:25:26] <apotheon> Egregore is much richer a term than "meme", though.
[02:25:48] <apotheon> Ungwelian: What's your objection to buddhism?
[02:25:50] <Delf> Free will is the limit of our comprehension of what it is that is actually CONTROLLiNG US.
[02:26:07] <Delf> You have free will.. and that's what it is.
[02:26:11] <wasd> so, assumpion "there is an it that is controlling us"
[02:26:31] <Delf> Yes, that it could be a collection of any number of things
[02:26:52] <wasd> or it could be nothing
[02:26:53] <Ungwelian> apotheon, I find it often cynical and also an Ishta-Deva. So much of Buddhism nowadays is overpositive marketing.
[02:27:28] <Delf> wasd: Nothing controlling us? So, the limit of our comprehension of... nothing that is actually controlling us?
[02:27:31] <apotheon> What about an underlying buddhist sense of the world, rather than dogma and marketing?
[02:27:40] <Ungwelian> Is there such a thing?
[02:27:48] <apotheon> sure
[02:27:59] <thunder> apotheon: egregore has more mythological baggage, unless you consider "kek" et al
[02:28:01] <wasd> I mean, you could go with "do I not get a drink when I feel thirsty" (impulse / needs) but that's hardly "an IT which is controlling us"
[02:28:09] <apotheon> There's such a thing in Christianity and various forms of nordic mythology, too.
[02:28:28] <apotheon> thunder: That's one way to put it.
[02:28:34] <thunder> like the fylgja
[02:28:44] <Ungwelian> Well...as it happens, comparative religion is my major.
[02:28:51] <Delf> It doesn't have to be a specific single one thing "it"..
[02:28:58] <thunder> but fylgja is more akin to genius, daimon, etc
[02:29:09] <wasd> It doesn't even have to be anything at all.
[02:29:16] <Ungwelian> ...and concerning Christianity, there's so many forms of it.
[02:29:18] <Delf> So nothing at all... controlling us?
[02:29:28] <Ungwelian> Major religions generally manifest in a huge multitude of forms.
[02:29:41] <wasd> sure.
[02:29:42] <apotheon> Ungwelian: I'm basically talking about the philosophy that lies behind, or emerges from, the religion when skipping all the concerns about adhering to received dogma, I guess.
[02:29:54] <Delf> wasd: I don't know how to work with that...
[02:30:08] <Ungwelian> Some of them bear little resemblance to one another. And another major religion can actually be closer, than a form of "the same" religion.
[02:30:14] <apotheon> perhaps a bit like how one could extract the ideas that gave rise to the Tao Te Ching from the fortune-telling system of the I Ching
[02:30:56] <apotheon> Ungwelian: The doctrine of free will in some branches of Christianity is more of a philosophical Christian idea than a religious idea, in this manner of differentiating.
[02:30:58] <wasd> Well, you could start with why you think it's a sensible assertion in the first place?  Or how such a conclusion may be reached from what parts etc?
[02:31:24] <apotheon> Ungwelian: One could, of course, draw the lines differently, but I don't draw them differently from how I draw them.

[02:34:09] <Delf> wasd: I've not been able to trace the origin of my thought or desires, at least not always. Specially the desires. But I've picked them apart, most of them.
[02:34:48] <Delf> And then I've constructed some rules that're the definitions of me and I stick to them. What I do and want is in accordance with my rules and those rules are based on my values.

[02:36:49] <thunder> Delf: for a long time while meditating it bothered me that whenever I had an insight, I would immediately feel an urge to run and tell someone. after carefully examining that, it dawned on me that we have in innate urge to reproduce our ideas in much the same way as our bodies.
[02:36:52] <wasd> that certainly makes sense.  The subjective, objective or absence nature of reality is unlikely to be resolved here tonight anyway.
[02:37:52] <thunder> the psyche is essentially a mirror reflection of the body and shares the same core patterns in it's own unique form of expression
[02:38:01] <Delf> thunder: Not to provide utility or assist others in their endeavours?
[02:38:35] <Delf> This I would say when I was about to write an ai that would self-define. So I stopped.
[02:38:35] <thunder> that's a transient situational context. I'm speaking of the instinct absent preconceptions of purpose

[02:41:48] <Delf> The way I understand it, feelings (emotions and urges resulting from emotions) are based on some kind of logic that we are not always aware of
[02:41:50] <thunder> the psyche has it's own mode of expression as distinct from the body. I presume they act in cooperation/coordination to a large degree. such as wooing a wife for instance.
[02:42:32] <wasd> the psyche being the concious and unconcious mind?
[02:42:54] <thunder> yes. the inside-out experience vs the outside-in experience.
[02:43:10] <Delf> So the logic in this case would be reproduction, to ensure or increase the continuation of existence?
[02:43:11] <wasd> s/concious/conscious/
[02:43:12] <ro-bot-o> wasd meant to say: the psyche being the conscious and unconcious mind?
[02:43:33] <wasd> nah!
[02:43:51] <wasd> 50% corrected :D
[02:44:44] <Delf> We do pattern recognition. Some patterns are similar but not equal or exact copies
[02:44:59] <wasd> There was that interesting thing about people trying to catch something flying and how they all used the same technique "pick a spot and get the thing between themselves and the spot" but they all had different 'conscious' explanations.
[02:45:14] <thunder> I was pondering the observation that people often believe irrational things. it seems that all that's necessary for a sense of "truth" is coherence among the associated thoughts or feelings. more intellectual people will emphasize coherence of thoughts over coherence of emotions, while emotional people the opposite. even the intellectuals become emotionally attached to that sense of coherence, blurring the lines. while emotional people also have
[02:45:15] <thunder> reasons they can express, however irrational they may seem. all that's required for truth is coherence.
[02:45:49] <wasd> Some explanation was the conscious was being distracted to allow the unconscious to get on with it and the distraction was a story it could follow and believe.
[02:46:01] *** Joins: deksar (~deksar@user/deksar)
[02:46:09] <Delf> I am unable to follow
[02:46:22] <wasd> That could apply to other contexts.
[02:47:02] <wasd> basically, what we think is happening "the story we tell ourselves" could just be nonsense made up to ensure our conscious mind doesn't get in the way of what the unconscious is trying to do anyway.
[02:47:22] <Delf> Yes
[02:47:25] <wasd> Seems unlikely but I'm sure that's what my unconscious would want me to say :D
[02:47:52] <Delf> Or that's what it would want you to think that it wants you to say
[02:48:31] <Delf> There is rationality to what people believe but rationality is different
[02:48:38] <thunder> the unconscious is just plain weird.
[02:49:10] <Delf> The unconscious... of what?
[02:49:12] <wasd> yes but also it's us.
[02:49:29] <thunder> Delf: yeah. the personal subjective sense of "truth" is perhaps different from the objective social sense of "truth"
[02:50:49] <Delf> If you try to somehow merge together the subjective.. in an effort to get to the objective... it would still subjective, but consisting of more data and likely more accurate
[02:51:10] <Delf> s/still/ still be/
[02:51:10] <ro-bot-o> Delf meant to say: If you try to somehow merge together the subjective.. in an effort to get to the objective... it would  still be subjective, but consisting of more data and likely more accurate
[02:51:35] <wasd> That's still sounding a lot like Anekantavada
[02:51:39] <Delf> s/  / /
[02:51:59] <thunder> I hear voices (auditory pareidolia). so I get to hear random parts of phrases and words in various tones of voice at random. I thought, oh, maybe this is a great little window into my own psyche that I can use to learn about the deeper parts of myself. sometimes. but usually it's just gibberish that leaves me scratching my head and wondering wtf was that?

[02:52:36] <Delf> thunder: So you hear voices, like me
[02:52:42] <thunder> anyhow, that's why I say the unconscious is weird.
[02:52:51] <thunder> Delf: like almost everyone
[02:53:00] <Delf> Yaa.. but not many would confess to it
[02:53:04] <thunder> some maybe more than others
[02:53:24] <thunder> yeah. social taboos. prevent people from being real with themselves.
[02:53:34] <Delf> Well, if I've had a discussion with you, I'd hear your voice... and a lot of words that do not form understandable sentences
[02:53:43] <thunder> same
[02:53:56] <thunder> sometimes the voices of tv characters
[02:54:16] <Delf> Yaa.. sometimes I hear things I cannot remember hearing before
[02:54:39] <thunder> I occasionally (more often than is acceptable) have conversations with christians who hear voices and interpret them as demons. not much you can do to help people who've already presumed the cause
[02:55:08] <thunder> except maybe give them a talisman
[02:55:25] <thunder> though, that won't get rid of anything. it's just a placebo

[03:04:49] <Delf> We got systems for selective breeding already
[03:05:07] <Delf> They suck shit too :P
[03:06:57] <Delf> Going back to the urge to share something acquired while meditating. Would you share it even if it were totally useless but viciously infectious?
[03:08:43] <Delf> If we are to consider it to be a reflection or mirror of the bodily reproductive systems, then you should've shared it even if it's useless and infectious
[03:09:39] <Delf> People want to have kids more than they want to BE parents.
[03:10:31] <thunder> I might have. but I think whether we consciously acknowledge it or not, what's being shared has to be congruent with our self-concept and desired type of relationship. people with "no filter" may not have that issue, but I think most people need to temper that instinct in order to function as social creatures.
[03:11:15] <Delf> Depends on what kind of filter. I may say things that will make people sad or hurt
[03:11:16] <thunder> just like we don't go around raping people at random either
[03:11:20] <thunder> hopefully
[03:11:44] <Delf> That depends on who "we" are. Unfortunately it occurs.

[03:14:45] <thunder> Delf: I do consider that a filter though. it helps me draw a line which defines how I choose to express myself. both out of consideration and a desire not to waste my breath.
[03:15:12] <Delf> thunder: That's interesting. Unable to understand it completely. Gratitude is protector of generosity?
[03:15:32] <thunder> custodian (ie. caregiver, nurturer, protector, etc)
[03:15:36] <Delf> Ahh
[03:15:54] <Delf> In this case it would be caregiver, nurturer
[03:16:29] <thunder> yes. but also if you are ungrateful towards others, they will like cease being generous. so if you want to protect their willingness to be generous, then being grateful is a good move.
[03:17:08] <thunder> it's meant to be flexible in context. like a zen koan for contemplation
[03:17:23] <Delf> I have limits to what I can accept so I will reject, not just accept.
[03:17:57] <Delf> One will cease to give you if you take too much also
[03:18:06] <thunder> as does everyone. sometimes our desire to be generous is selfishly motivated. if we don't take feedback from the recipient we may end up burdening them with what we're attempting to foist on them.
[03:18:35] <Delf> Even if you're ever grateful
[03:19:21] <Delf> Yaa.. like parents who did not receive from their parents... will give TOO MUCH to their own kids, teaching them to be ungreatful
[03:20:08] <thunder> this is one thing I don't like about modern xmas celebrations. everyone is expected to smile and pretend to like everything they're given, much of which just ends up on shelf until it's out of mind sufficiently to be disposed of. that fake gratitude makes for enormous wastefulness as a society.
[03:20:14] <Delf> To give to your child, what you did not receive as an addition to what your child already deserves

[03:21:55] <vaquero> thunder:  i think the problem is people in the west no longer differentiate between needs and wants
[03:22:22] <Delf> vaquero: In swedish there's a term for it, it's called... villhöver
[03:22:36] <Delf> It's a mege of vill (want) and behöver (need)
[03:23:01] <thunder> I also like the story of oku-thor gaining his thralls thjalfi and roskva for a traditional yule tale, because it's a story about hospitality and on a deeper layer, ecological stewardship
[03:23:03] <bittersweetsymph> Are you from Sweden Delf ?
[03:23:29] <bittersweetsymph> Mmm $1 cheeseburger
[03:23:40] <vaquero> Delf:  is it seen as a bad thing? cause i keep seeing people especially young people who say need constanatly when what they mean is want
[03:23:43] <Delf> I hail from Sweden, yes, bittersweetsymph.
[03:24:00] <thunder> vaquero: yeah. I have a saying for that "need is custodian of desire". need occurs in the here and now, whereas desire is perpetually focused away from it.
[03:24:06] <Delf> vaquero: Well it depends on who it is that is seeing it :P
[03:24:24] <vaquero> when i was learning counselling that was one of the big things i took away from it. stop saying need and creating an artificial pressure for things you want
[03:25:13] <vaquero> thunder:  thats true, i never thought of its impact in that way. the want is a distant desire, ive been trying lately to stay present in my body and not wondering into the mental abyss of nothingness
[03:25:41] <vaquero> you become so stagnant when you spend more time thinking outside of your body instead of actioning within your body
[03:25:43] <thunder> to me need is the limit of what is required for sustenance/survival. once my needs are met, everything else is surplus which I can share freely.
[03:26:08] <biys> this conversation is so romantic
[03:26:34] <Delf> No need to romanticize it, biys
[03:26:55] <Delf> We're decent people.. having a conversation
[03:26:55] * thunder is going afk for a smoke, tea, food, etc
[03:27:02] <Delf> Take care, nice talk
[03:27:06] <thunder> likewise
[03:27:20] <biys> are you guys seriously talking about materialism ?
[03:27:45] <Delf> A number of things, regarding how people behave
[03:28:15] <vaquero> i know im smoking to much weed when i spend a day sitting on my balcony thinking things i could be doing instead of actually doing them but i dont think thats the weeds fault. i think i just have bad habits and when im not prepared the weed exacerbates those bad behaviors
[03:28:47] <Delf> Why do you smoke weed?
[03:30:32] <vaquero> i started cause it was a great way to enhance what i was doing ( like mowing the lawn) but now i think i use it as a crutch for something to do when i feel bored
[03:30:37] *** Joins: NEYi (~NEYi@109.251.216.38)
[03:32:06] <Delf> My condolences
[03:33:24] <Delf> I used to get bored when I was young... back in the days.. when had a desire to be entertained
[03:37:05] <vaquero> i feel sorry for this new generation, so use to constant entertainment. i feel like thats why so many of them are full of anxiety
[03:37:41] <Delf> No...
[03:38:18] <Delf> Anxiety is most likely a consequence of self-hate. Harboring desire to have looks that they do not have. Or have things that others do not have. Lack of understanding their own value or worth.
[03:38:49] <Delf> Being bored is a consequence of being a hedonist
[03:40:00] <vaquero> yeah i think the social media which creates inactivity is where the self hate is coming from. kids feeling like they are wasting/losing time (cause they are) but dont realize its the social media they live on thats doing it
[03:40:26] <Delf> It's all about seeing... what others are doing. And not doing.
[03:40:57] <Delf> And when they grow up they're learn to sexually objectify themselves
[03:41:24] <Delf> It's bad to objectify others, but society is teaching how to objectify oneself
[03:45:52] <vaquero> i watched a thing about dopamine fasting and no idea if it works or not but everytime ive done stints of getting of social media ive always become way more productive and felt less bored and i do feel like its cause i wasnt over stimulating my brain 24/7
[03:47:07] <Delf> When you see others making achievements, you don't need to make them yourself... unfortunately
