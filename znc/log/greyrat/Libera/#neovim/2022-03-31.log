[00:37:09] <telemachus> willdavidowWillD: Or, ah, are you trying to set two different things *both* to be the `<Leader>`? The last I don't think you can do.

[04:14:10] <nova> is there a better way to reload a lua script in /lua/ than setting its package entry to nil?
[04:14:13] <dre> it's so hard to read code like this
[04:14:15] <nova> and then re-requiring it
[04:14:20] <dre> use dpaste.org
[04:14:47] <dre> nova, can you not source it? 
[04:15:19] <dre> also what are you trying to do?
[04:15:38] <dre> like, why 'wait until packer complete' or whatever?
[04:16:18] <nova> lspconfig not loaded first time until packercomplete and plugins installed. in this one case, I wait until packer installs it and then re-require my lsp config
[04:17:15] <dre> does it re-install every time you open nvim? or just on updates / etc ? 
[04:17:21] <dre> i don't use packer
[04:18:11] <dre> because to me the answer is a little more 'save your time' - but if you want to experiment then go ahead. I don't see what's wrong with setting it nil and re-requiring it though, that seems neat to me.
[04:18:41] <nova> if I don't use require I have to either look through $VIMRUNTIME with vim.fn.globpath(vim.env.VIMRUNTIME, 'init/lsp.lua') (if that would work??) or assume it's in vim.fn.stdpath'config'..'/lua/init/lsp.lua')
[04:19:25] <dre> it's safe to assume, unless it was capable of growing legs and moving around on its own accord
[04:19:28] <nova> I just like experimenting and continually improving init
[04:19:49] <dre> I'd say stdpath config is the right place to be
[04:19:56] <nova> I'm under no obligation - even from myself - to "do things the easy way"
[04:20:09] <dre> from memory, stdconfig / lua is already added to the path ? 
[04:20:20] <dre> so you should be able to just require('init.lsp') with no issues.
[04:21:10] <nova> require('init/lsp.lua'). I have a lua/start.lua script that auto-loads lua/init/*.lua and populates the quickfix list with errors from traceback via debug module
[04:21:26] <nova> and you can't re-require a script because it gets cached in package.loaded
[04:21:35] <nova> hence settin' it to nil
[04:21:57] <dre> perhaps move lsp out of init then, if it's not meant to be done "at initialisation" 
[04:22:08] <dre> but ye, intersting ideas.
[04:22:19] <nova> or I could  vim.cmd[[ execute 'luafile' stdpath('config') ]]  indeed buuut hmm feels equally weird
[04:22:39] <dre> I gotta run now to get a new battery for someone's iphone. bbl~~~ 
[04:23:01] <nova> it doesn't matter where it is. Once it gets required, you either have to set package.loaded["whatever path relative to lua/"] = nil or use luafile on it
[04:23:15] <nova> and I don't want to defer it so it "has" to get required once during init
[04:23:35] <nova> np bye

[16:17:47] <theh> `#ifndef` and `#define`, shouldn't they be the more similar? I wrote their type in the comment. Especially `@keyword` is a bad fit, that's used for `const`, `class`, `using` etc.

[16:43:17] <clason[m]> (and nobody complained at the time)
[16:45:47] <clason[m]> and `#define` is the odd one out, set as `@constant.macro` (which probably should apply to the `HELLO` rather than the `#define`?)

[16:52:56] <theh> Which Matrix clients are you guys using? So far I'm stuck with ElementWeb but not too happy; I tried Fractal but that had very poor discoverability, and was missing basic features (GNOME style) at the time.

[18:32:53] <telemachus> Does anyone have any experience editing, adding, or extending treesitter queries for textobjects? I must be doing something very wrong because even if I edit files directly in `.config/nvim/path/to/treesitter-textobject/queries`, the queries don't change. Is there a step needed where I (in some sense) "recompile" the queries for a particular language?
[18:35:14] <telemachus> (By "the queries don't change," I mean that the text objects that get selected don't change. I'm trying to tweak the inner function text objects to work on this longstanding problem: https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects/issues/112.)

[19:18:39] <jensen> how do you decide when to use which? 
[19:19:37] <clason[m]> basically, anytime it involves Lua, I use Lua
[19:19:48] <ii14[m]> some stuff is just more convenient to write in vim script
[19:19:51] <clason[m]> (configuring Lua plugins, mappings to Lua-only API)
[19:20:05] <clason[m]> otherwise vimscript by default
[19:20:28] <clason[m]> (I'm assuming we're talking about configuring; writing actual code would be Lua first, since that's an actual programming language)
[19:21:01] <gpanders> +1 to everything clason said

[19:22:21] <jensen> yea configuring. i'm new to vim/neovim so i would be more likely to use lua if it's supposed to be better than vimscript in many ways (just learning lua is preferable than vimscript as it's a transferrable skill)
[19:22:53] <gpanders> for configuring (setting options or whatever) Vimscript is better. It was made for that exact purpose
[19:23:13] <gpanders> and it's true that in general Lua is more transferrable, the Neovim API is not, so I really wouldn't sweat it too much
[19:23:17] <jensen> do i need to more vimscript than needed for the colon commands and would that be enough to write a function?
[19:23:18] <telemachus> When I switched back to neovim recently, I experimented and rewrote my vimrc into lua as an init.lua. It was fine, but I haven't bothered to rewrite all the rest of my vimscript dotfiles (with functions, mappings, autocommands, etc.) to Lua. I may someday look into reworking the functions, but there's no rush.
[19:23:31] <telemachus> But if I were writing a new plugin, I would definitely try to write that in Lua.
[19:24:13] <telemachus> (To clarify, I have a relatively short vimrc and then most of the extra functionality is in a repo that I keep in pack/bundle/start.)

[19:29:25] <sudoforge[m]> i wholeheartedly disagree with the statement that vimscript is superior for configuration. lua, being an actual programming language, provides much more utility. take [this](https://github.com/sudoforge/dotfiles/blob/trunk/nvim/.config/nvim/ftdetect/init.lua) as a small example -- it is much simpler to maintain and reason about than the same configuration written in vimscript. be DRY and all that.
[19:29:42] <telemachus> The new mappings api in Lua looks good and also the autocommand api, but I'm not in a rush to rewrite everything in Lua. But writing Lua for neovim is almost like working with a DSL. It doesn't always feel much like Lua to me. Then again, Lua is often embedded, so I guess that kind of DSL on top of Lua is common. But I learned Lua for scripting, so things look and feel different to me.
[19:30:38] <gpanders> sudoforge: nvim_define_autocmd is not an API function, did you create that one yourself?
[19:31:12] <ii14[m]> if i understand what it does correctly, it would've been like 5 lines or code in vim script

[19:31:29] <telemachus> @sudoforge[m] Sure, Lua can be nice for that kind of thing (e.g., https://git.sr.ht/~telemachus/dotfiles/tree/main/item/nvim/init.lua#L23-46), but a lot of init.lua will end up being just `opt.laststatus = 2` which is no better in Lua than Vimscript.

[19:34:34] <ii14[m]> no
[19:34:57] <ii14[m]> this is really straightforward
[19:35:15] <sudoforge[m]> for a handful of ft mappings, sure.
[19:35:39] <ii14[m]> vim does this for like 800 filetypes
[19:36:14] <sudoforge[m]> right, and a `ft = [paths]` approach would simplify that.
[19:36:28] <ii14[m]> it looks more complicated to me
[19:36:39] <sudoforge[m]> it's 6 to one-half dozen of the other. i'm not trying to force my opinion on anyone.
[19:37:04] <gpanders> sudoforge[m]: Neovim did this for filetype.lua but it was more for performance reasons than anything else

[23:25:25] <ianliu> I'm trying to edit a remote file with :e scp://server/.gitconfig, but this is opening an empty buffer. If I instead run :Nread ... I get this netrwmessage: attemp to read </tmp/nvim435345/4.gitconfig into a non-modifiable buffer!
[23:27:19] <ianliu> ah, I guess the scp is asking for password, which neovim can't show... hmm
