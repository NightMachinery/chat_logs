[20:59:42] * xnaas might not be understanding the question
[21:02:04] <luvalon1> this is just one of the links, but I didnt upload that picture into storage and now its not there anymroe
[21:02:16] <luvalon1> xnaas, thats why I assmume someone used my thelounge
[21:02:27] <luvalon1> or what could be another explanation?
[21:27:55] <luvalon1> hm seems like its still unclear? xnaas

[22:24:48] <xnaas> luvalon1: For someone to delete a file from your system, they would need shell access. thelounge doesn't support any sort of deletion through the GUI.

[22:25:23] <xnaas> Do you have port 22 open? Do you have a weak-ass password instead of using key-based auth for SSH? :P
[22:41:13] <luvalon1> xnaas no I have pubkey auth of course
[22:41:46] <luvalon1> and on non standard port, also I would be notified if someone logs in via ssh. well, the pictures in storage that were accessed are gone
[22:45:01] <luvalon1> bookworm what is voicing someone btw?
[22:54:56] <xnaas> voice give you a + on your name
[22:55:04] <xnaas> you can speak when the channel is +M or +m or whatever
[22:55:05] <xnaas> whichever it is
[22:55:38] <xnaas> Anyway, if someone somehow accessed you lounge, they literally couldn't delete the image unless they had access to your system, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
