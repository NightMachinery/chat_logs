[06:22:35] <bruda> the best internet I can find for this area I think is Casair. Whatever it's renamed to now.
[06:23:05] <mikebutash> better get on the corner and sell dem crack rocks.  :D

[06:25:27] <bruda> I'm hearing good things about Casair's setup. Might only get 25mbps but it's consistent and fully unlimited.
[06:26:31] <mikebutash> I know folks that use some rural wifi solutions here, but always kinda janky.  Satellite is crap unless LEO with Starlink.
[06:26:32] <bruda> Lowest package I think its 10mbps. Which would be surivable here. No upfront costs, no contracts, etc. Plus fair monthly rates.

[06:30:10] <mikebutash> they did recently, can't get enough hardware to make them, plus I've known people on the list for a year or more still not hit up either, so it's hit or miss.
[06:30:11] <bruda> We got a water well to fix and a deer-smashed car to fix. So the fancy solutions will have to wait.
[06:30:34] <bruda> for now we get a free hotspot from the library 2 weeks out of the month. the rest of the time we just make do when we go to town.
[06:31:04] <mikebutash> a lot less latency than satellite, I'm not sure I could deal with satellite for remote ssh work...
[06:31:26] <mikebutash> but why I also don't live rural.
[06:31:38] <bruda> Satellite has high latency. It's not really much good for anything that requires a good ping.

[06:33:03] <mikebutash> I was just like what, your service sucks.
[06:33:10] <bruda> So I'm not doing satellite anymore. Probably not even Starlink. Even though its supposed to have a better ping.
[06:33:33] <bruda> It'll still be more latency than say a mobile solution or such.
[06:34:08] <mikebutash> slightly yes, but actually better than I thought even watching reports come in from Geerling and others
[06:34:22] <bruda> All the research I've done so far, and the limited options I have, led me to Casair being the most likely solution for my area.

[06:36:49] <bruda> I miss cable. Charter was my goto for many years.
[06:37:21] <bruda> If I was rich I'd pay them to run cable out here lol
[06:37:42] <mikebutash> that is why people started creating their own isp's.
[06:38:51] <mikebutash> if I had to move to some rural area with shit internet, I probably would too, not the first isp I've built up and operated, but gotta get your neighbors to throw in too.
[06:38:51] <bruda> Easier said than done though. Need a high speed connection to the net in order to serve traffic to your area.
[06:40:07] <mikebutash> I'm an asshole though, I don't talk to my neighbors, and don't use fakebook.

[14:53:00] <orangeFlu> anybody know where picom is launched from so i can add --experimental-backends to it?
[14:53:19] <orangeFlu> it doesn't use my blur and i have to restart it manually everytime
[14:53:27] <orangeFlu> but i dont know where it launches from
[14:53:27] <Namarrgon> you should know that, you set it up
[14:53:48] <orangeFlu> i didnt add anything to xinitrc or anything like that
[14:53:52] <orangeFlu> thats the weird part
[14:53:57] <orangeFlu> it just starts by itself
[14:54:09] <thrice> what environment do you use?
[14:54:15] <orangeFlu> i3
[14:54:26] <thrice> then probably the i3 config
[14:54:34] <orangeFlu> it's not on there, checked
[14:55:08] <susi> orangeFlu: you dont have a DM?
[14:55:14] <thrice> nothing in the package exists in an autostart location
[14:55:26] <orangeFlu> susi: no
[14:55:58] <orangeFlu> i just did a grep search on the filesystem to find all instances of it
[14:56:08] <orangeFlu> ofc, not the whole system
[14:56:10] <susi> dunno when picom's meant to be launched, or any compositor
[14:56:27] <susi> but I'd put it either in i3's conf or xserverrc/xinitrc
[14:56:37] <orangeFlu> ok then, i will keep looking, maybe i missed something
[14:56:46] <Namarrgon> is this arch or some spin?
[14:56:50] <orangeFlu> arch
[14:57:01] <Namarrgon> how was it installed?
[14:57:56] <orangeFlu> what do you mean?
[14:58:01] <orangeFlu> the normal way, i would assume
[14:58:14] <Namarrgon> assume?
[14:58:21] <Namarrgon> who installed it for you?
[14:58:31] <thrice> grep picom in your home dir, too
[14:58:52] <orangeFlu> the way everybody does it => iso to usb, usb in computer, follow the wiki and then add x, i3 and all the other crap
[14:59:01] <orangeFlu> Namarrgon: i did
[14:59:06] <Namarrgon> at which point did you install picom?

[15:02:10] <thrice> from the man-page, isn't -b a daemon ?
[15:02:27] <orangeFlu> because i like yay and i thought the normal picom didnt work with blur for some reason, then installed picom-git and then realised i needed to experimental-backends, so i am using picom-git now because there in no point in reinstalling it
[15:02:31] <orangeFlu> thrice: yes
[15:03:33] <thrice> does it start if you reboot and launch X again?
[15:03:37] <orangeFlu> yes
[15:03:56] <orangeFlu> weird thing is, i cant find it in the running processes
[15:03:59] <orangeFlu> if i reboot

[16:42:36] <mpan> tatsumaru: no
[16:42:58] <MacGyver> tirnanog: It's also not necessary to drive it off the battery all the time.
[16:43:06] <tatsumaru> hmm, not sure why I was left with the impression that SSDs are easier to wipe than HDDs
[16:43:10] <tirnanog> MacGyver: true.
[16:43:16] <Khorne> will it blend
[16:43:35] <mpan> tatsumaru: they are not. Actually, due to extensive wear leveling, it’s opposite.
[16:43:55] <Khorne> Just melt them
[16:44:00] <Khorne> Just as easy as HDDs
[16:44:35] <MacGyver> The i-RAM's backup battery was 1.4Ah at 3.7V.
[16:44:37] <tatsumaru> Khorne, the advantages of being a blacksmith
[16:44:39] <mpan> tatsumaru: the confusion with RAM might have come from both of them using electric charge to store information.
[16:44:47] <earnestly> tirnanog: The only reasonable method of 'wiping' drives with the capacities today is to use encryption and delete the key
[16:44:55] <earnestly> tatsumaru: *^
[16:44:56] <mpan> Khorne: which is the official recommendation for US governmential agencies now, by the way.
[16:45:11] <Khorne> mpan, I'm not really joking :')

[16:45:53] <tatsumaru> earneslty: does that mean that it would be a better idea to have a smaller drive or even a usb stick for the most sensitive data because it's faster to wipe?
[16:45:59] <tatsumaru> earnestly:*
[16:46:02] <tirnanog> MacGyver: ok, but scale it up to the kind of capacity than an SSD has and it might be a different story.
[16:47:01] <MacGyver> tirnanog: Probably, yeah.
[16:47:08] <mpan> tatsumaru: it’s slower to wipe, because writes to USB sticks are usually slow.
[16:47:13] <MacGyver> tirnanog: The backup battery really was only for when the machine was unplugged.
[16:47:24] <MacGyver> tirnanog: Even when off it'd just be driven from standby power.

[18:27:30] <susi> no, quickiest way would be loginctl terminate-user $USER
[18:27:46] <galroth> Reboot is probably the easiest, but definitely not the quickest.
[18:27:56] <susi> pretty stupid there's no way of re-loading it without rebooting the X
[18:27:59] <mpan> As the Master Pedant I must agree.
[18:28:12] <mpan> susi: I never said about rebooting the X. I said to restart the X client.
[18:28:20] <mpan> That is: the application that uses X.
[18:28:32] <galroth> As a Master Debater, I'd be willing to argue the point.
[18:28:55] <susi> so loginctl terminate-user it is
[18:28:56] <mpan> .XCompose is picked up when a client connects to xorg.

[18:30:28] <susi> aa
[18:30:45] <mpan> Well, if you want to restart it all: sure. That’s the easiest way. But it’s not neccessary if your goal is just to test.

[20:09:04] <feral_hedgehog> Hello! I'm trying to add LVM to an existing dm-crypt setup.
[20:09:15] <feral_hedgehog> Right now it looks like this: Physical drive @ /dev/sda -> LUKS2 partition @ /dev/sda2 -> ext4 partition @ /dev/mapper/cryptroot (pretty much identical to https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LUKS_on_a_partition).
[20:09:17] <achilleas> also interesting: if I switch my primary display (which is the one the panel is on) to 1080 (from 1440), the problem goes away again

[20:09:48] <feral_hedgehog> I want to convert it to LUKS on LVM. My plan is to open cryptroot, back it up with e2image (unencrypted), nuke /dev/sda2 -> set up LVM on it -> set up a logical volume @ /dev/VolGroup/cryptroot -> set up LUKS2 on said LV -> open said LUKS2 partition and restore image previously backed up with e2image.
[20:10:07] <feral_hedgehog> Is this valid approach? Right now I'm mainly worried about resizing the backed up image.

[20:13:46] <MacGyver> The ext4 partition it contains.
[20:14:14] <MacGyver> Shrink the partition, do the backup, transfer backup into new volume, extend.
[20:14:29] <MacGyver> (Or shrink the backup. Whatever floats your goat)
[20:16:25] <feral_hedgehog> Can I shrink the partition after I've transferred it back? i.e Backup (e2image) -> set up and open LVM and LUKS containers -> restore (e2image) -> resize with fstab + resize2fs
[20:16:34] <MacGyver> No.
[20:16:46] <MacGyver> Because the partition won't fit the target.
[20:17:22] <MacGyver> Though maybe it's possible to get e2image to spit out a smaller partition?
[20:17:41] <MacGyver> I doubt it though.
[20:17:47] <feral_hedgehog> You sure? e2image just finished with an image of 52GB (partition is ~128GB)
[20:18:06] <MacGyver> Yes, but that's because it creates a sparse image.
[20:18:19] <MacGyver> The filesystem it represents is still 128GiB.
[20:18:27] <MacGyver> Putting that back requires a 128GiB partition.
[20:18:38] <MacGyver> And you've only got 127.5 or such.

[23:34:10] <mikebutash> last time I used one was circa 2014, the company at the time was tired of hearing about my shit "normal" laptop, and bought me a pimp $3k asus to shut me up, it was a basketcase that even power management was broken.

[23:35:05] <mikebutash> stupid vendors with acpi problems, I couldn't even install ubuntu at the time I was using mostly as the gpu would go batshit and destabilize the os even in the install process

[23:35:57] <umaxtu> nouveau drivers are awful for anything recent
[23:36:11] <mikebutash> all I could do was boot and quickly as possible unload the gpu to do a server install with the old ncurses menus.
[23:37:01] <mikebutash> it took me weeks to even figure out how to get the os to boot and load on it, as it also didn't do legacy, non-efi booting.
