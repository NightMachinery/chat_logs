[00:33:12] <dTal> I'm tempted to say that if there are tons of copies on ebay for super cheap, they're probably popular enough to not lose sleep over it

[00:47:52] <louipc> its possible they dont get royalty for all pressed CDs
[00:47:55] <dTal> I'm not even sure that's true in this case.
[00:48:10] <louipc> those ebay CDs might be overstock that weren't recorded as retail sales
[00:48:14] <dTal> It's an tour promo album, and the sellers has tons of them.

[22:57:22] <sublim20> its on the list
[22:57:40] <sublim20> the begining of osamus theme, reminds me A LOT of hendrix's third stone from the sun

[22:59:26] <macrobat> watching koyaanisqatsi feels like being told the mundane things you already know is super important. for hours
