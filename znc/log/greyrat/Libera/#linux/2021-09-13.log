If the file-system in the partition is readable by GRUB it'll show the files. If you see any vmlinuz* and/or initrd*

[04:56:12] <Sauvin> Granted and agreed. Thing is, it's impossible to mandate that standard vanilla English be used, and it's impossible to mandate proper "grammar".
[04:56:36] <Sauvin> Most people, sadly, have no idea what "grammar" even is.

[06:52:10] <jim> L0neSol0, yeah, could have been I guess

[06:52:20] <gamah> ick
[06:52:21] <SineDeviance> it's a snap instead
[06:52:21] <MinusOne> you can try the flatpak gamah
[06:52:33] <gamah> what's the deal with snap? i remember it was to be avoided when it was new.... it hasn't improved...?
[06:52:35] <SineDeviance> if you want it installed as a deb package, download it from the chrome website
[06:52:51] <SineDeviance> snap is just snap. it's another way to 'containerize' applications
[06:52:55] <SineDeviance> like appimage, or docker
[06:52:55] <MinusOne> gamah, I find snaps mostly fine, but since you are having this issue I suggest you try another version
[06:52:59] <gamah> SineDeviance: you say that... but now i hear "install debian"
[06:53:02] <SineDeviance> it doesn't have the features of docker though

[06:53:19] <L0neSol0> jim, any ideas where to go from here about building my kernel without modules? I tried asking in #Manjaro and they refused to admit it was Manjaro related and said I need to take to Apple or #linux
[06:53:50] <SineDeviance> gamah: eh, I totally would install debian if it wasn't a whole major kernel revision behind
[06:53:52] <MinusOne> gamah, you can also install i.e., kubuntu-desktop, xubuntu-desktop and take another DE for a test drive without much work
[06:53:58] <Sauvin> L0neSol0, you pissed off the people who could best help you. Good luck.
[06:54:06] <gamah> oh so snap is tied to gnome?

[06:55:04] <SineDeviance> L0neSol0: here is me helping you - ditch manjaro (and all other 'build your own' distros built on Arch) and go to something with a modern stable base. linux mint is a great option. zorin OS is also, if you want something a little different

[07:06:02] <SineDeviance> <L0neSol0> SineDeviance I believe I'm close ;) <-- I don't, I doubt you'll ever fix it. Macs have a lot of ACPI issues on Linux in my experience
[07:06:05] <bewees> [[R]], I am going to split physical with virtual interfaces, that should fix the issue. Not sure why nftables throws an error for not existing devices, could aswell assume they will be loaded later :-)
[07:06:28] <SineDeviance> Sauvin: nah, it's in there on recent kernels, just doesn't work right
[07:07:04] <L0neSol0> SineDeviance maybe you could fix yours with the info at https://iam.tj/prototype/enhancements/Windows-acpi_osi.html it doesn't work for me because I don't have or use GRUB on this apple hardware, and the instructions mention debian based distros while I'm on Manjaro (arch based)
[07:07:07] <Sauvin> There's the kernel part, and then there's the firmware part. As I understood it, ACPI trouble on Linux skates in the fog space between those two.
[07:07:15] <[[R]]> bewees: 🎶 lets get physical... physical...
[07:07:26] <SineDeviance> L0neSol0: there is no fixing mine, the code to fix mine does not exist yet
[07:07:40] <SineDeviance> it 'works' but it also doesn't work
[07:07:45] <SineDeviance> it's a bug
[07:07:55] <bewees> [[R]], Hehe
[07:08:15] <jim> Sauvin, I'm thinking the other issue might be because there are no modules selected in the .config in the kernel source tree
[07:08:22] <L0neSol0> jim, linux5143.preset
[07:08:23] <SineDeviance> no amount of recompiling my kernel will fix it. the only fix right now is to force a sleep/wake cycle at boot time with rtcwake (which works fine)
[07:08:35] <[[R]]> bewees: you could make a service file that triggers on the individual interfaces getting created
[07:08:53] <Sauvin> Just install Ubuntu on the goddamn thing and call it a day. It won't be perfect, but it'll be a LOT easier to find meaningful help.
[07:09:01] <SineDeviance> ^Yep
[07:09:06] <L0neSol0> jim, I can load up menuconfig if you think no modules are selected in the .config and share screenshots
[07:09:14] <[[R]]> Sauvin: BAZINGA
[07:09:30] <jim> L0neSol0, ok, we'll try a couple things...

[07:09:44] <L0neSol0> jim, ok, thanks
[07:10:16] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:10:22] <jim> it looks like the file name matches... so let's give it the full path
[07:10:33] <SineDeviance> install ubuntu 21.04 and pull kernel 5.14. if you still have issues, chances are they haven't been ironed out yet upstream and you just have to wait
[07:10:42] <SineDeviance> alternatively you can always go back to macos
[07:10:52] <jim> L0neSol0, try: sudo mkinitcpio -p /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux5143.preset
[07:10:57] <bewees> [[R]], Good idea, I will try that thanks

[07:11:14] <[[R]]> bewees: the only kind of ideas i have
[07:11:25] <[[R]]> bewees: i once wrote a service file to start wpa supplicant when the wlan interface appeared
[07:11:28] <[[R]]> bewees: it was glorious
[07:11:45] <babyface> MacOS runs pretty well on the M1 macs too bad you can't run Linux on those babies
[07:11:55] <SineDeviance> just so you are aware L0neSol0, it is not uncommon for macs to have ACPI issues even on Windows (which is officially supported) > https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6857756
[07:11:56] <Sauvin> I believe L0neSol0 mumbled something about Apple spyware and telemetry. What's truly sad is that I can't say he's full of it.

[08:21:19] *** Joins: HyN0X (~HyNoX@151.47.108.236)
[08:21:40] <L0neSol0> jim, nope, the ethernet would have to connect over thunderbolt and it only works till it's disconnected (i.e. it's not hotswappable) but there are no other ethernet ports on this machine
[08:22:11] <bewees> Didn't know that if you move a file, you need to update the SELinux context with `restorecon -rv /new/path`. I wonder if a reboot solve this too. To prevent this I should alias `cp=cp -c; mv=mv -Z; rsync=rsync -X`
[08:22:22] <jim> ok, here's the situation...
[08:22:52] <jim> if you reboot into the new kernel it will not have net capabilities as the module for it wasn't built
[08:23:48] <L0neSol0> jim, okay, I can use another machine if need be
[08:24:33] <jim> so we're at a crossroads (with one path leading to repeating what we did): either you can try the new kernel and not use the net at all while you do, or we can loop back and build the wireless module (if possible)

[09:15:04] <jim> yeah, I'd say so
[09:15:25] <HEX0> L0neSol0: I think this is pretty much it for normally compiling kernel https://paste.rs/AcL
[09:15:27] <jim> and also bmca (just in case)
[09:17:26] <L0neSol0> jim, I didn't see any BCMA or bmca
[09:17:38] <jim> HEX0, the instructions we're using have particular edits to some config files, and installing by copying the vmlinuz to have a specific name in /boot due to references in the comfigs
[09:17:56] <jim> L0neSol0, you mean in make menuconfig?
[09:18:11] <L0neSol0> yes
[09:18:28] <jim> ok, then let's just go with b43
[09:19:24] <jim> (we don't have much of a choice)
[09:19:55] <jim> the bmca module must have been in some other kernel, or out of tree
[09:19:58] <HEX0> L0neSol0: what kernel are you running now? the official manjaro one?
[09:20:16] <jim> I think he is
[09:20:39] <HEX0> and I assume he grabbed vanilla kernel from kernel.org hence the missing stuff maybe

[15:17:47] <garylabronz> If it free's up my CPU for more snappy performance on other tasks, i think thats a benefit
[15:18:00] <koollman> a better way to think about them is that they are all 'accelerated', just in different ways. Technically, any card supporting vga text mode will accelerate a terminal, just with different options :)

[21:19:48] <peetaur> FYI back in the day with scsi you could lower the timeout and it would be *way* faster ... like you could copy one of those copy protected dvds that have bad sectors to slow you down, and it would be fast still. But can you do that with SAS?

[22:00:24] <BCMM> anyway, if for some reason you still want to do that, you could rig something up using xdg-mime

[22:01:55] <peetaur> ^-^hi: make your laptop the default gateway, or run the socks proxy there?  Note that SIP is a horrible protocol and sticks local private network addresses in the SIP headers, and then the remote might stupidly try using them to send replies instead of using the remote address of the connection it uses like it obviously should... this might break everything horribly.

[22:11:47] <peetaur> until you add SIP and the hackery that comes with it, it's the same way as you do it locally
[22:12:31] <peetaur> so if you used tor browser for example, look in the proxy settings...you'll see it has a localhost thing in there; instead of your proxy being on localhost, make it listen on the external interface too; then the other machine's firefox can use that same url but with the right ip/name instead of localhost

[23:34:25] <XV8> That's where this problem originated. Updates failed because /var/cache filled up /var. Turns out /var/cache/yum was the culprit. Told them instead of rm -rf /var/cache/* completely, you can just run the 'yum clean all' command (I do it all the time when this happens and haven't had issue) and that would have cleared up most of the issues. The ultimate fix is expanding the /var partition, but this guy swears 4GB for /var is enough,
[23:34:25] <XV8>  especially when other applications are dumping data into this directory.
