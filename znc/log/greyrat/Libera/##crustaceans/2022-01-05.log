[00:02:45] <Church> I want curry
[00:02:52] <imode> same.
[00:02:57] <Church> I should go find things to use on this new air fryer
[00:05:37] <bkero> Go make curry in your air fryer
[00:06:21] <Church> I have no curry nor ingredients
[00:22:12] <manicennui> Coat the things in curry paste and then air fry?
[00:22:47] <manicennui> Or put them in some kind of pastry?
[00:23:02] <bkero> curry is a state of mind
[00:25:41] <manicennui> A sauce of mind.
[01:12:10] <bontaq> air fried bread?
[01:24:11] <bkero> "air fryed" anything
[01:24:13] <manicennui> Air fryers are basically convection ovens.
[01:25:36] <bkero> Yep

[01:28:11] <manicennui> Wow. It has been 10 years.
[01:28:24] <manicennui> I'm bad at remembering how long ago things were.
[01:28:48] <Brekkjern> Everyone is
[01:28:50] <Brekkjern> Really.
[01:29:18] <Brekkjern> Only way you really can is to connect things with other things until you can tie it to something with a definite date
[01:29:59] <manicennui> Yeah, I remember a bunch of things that happened in 2007.
[01:30:07] <manicennui> And things that happened right before or after.

[01:32:28] <manicennui> I think 1871 might be one of the few years that many Chicagoans remember.
[01:32:46] <dminkovsky> the year that music died?
[01:33:46] <manicennui> Great Chicago Fire
[01:34:35] <dminkovsky> yeah i know
[01:34:57] <dminkovsky> they were singing, bye bye miss american pie
[01:35:02] <manicennui> "centipeding"
[01:35:12] <dminkovsky> what's that
[01:35:23] <manicennui> You'll have to watch the video Brekkjern linked to.
[01:35:30] <Brekkjern> lol
[01:35:53] <Brekkjern> It's a great example of associating different things together to get an answer :P
[01:36:18] <manicennui> 2007 is the year I moved into the city, among other things.
[01:36:38] <dminkovsky> oh so you were that guy on the street
[01:36:50] <dminkovsky> i walked past, that one time
[01:36:57] <manicennui> That was you?
[01:37:01] <dminkovsky> yup
[01:37:18] <companion_cube> fake, that was me
[01:37:22] <companion_cube> I was in the city before manicennui
[01:37:38] <manicennui> I also went to ACL in 2007.
[01:37:45] <dminkovsky> what's ACL
[01:37:53] <manicennui> Austin City Limits
[01:38:01] <dminkovsky> i bet there's someone out there who remembers everyone they see

[01:42:35] <buttsbot> Eidetic memory - Wikipedia
[01:43:55] <manicennui> Apparently the versions of this we see in TVs/movies is complete bullshit.
[01:44:06] <dminkovsky> interesting
[01:44:50] <dminkovsky> The word eidetic comes from the Greek word Œµ·º∂Œ¥ŒøœÇ (pronounced [√™Àêdos], eidos) "visible form".[8]
[01:44:55] <dminkovsky> cool
[01:45:31] <manicennui> "Although the terms eidetic memory and photographic memory are popularly used interchangeably,[1] they are also distinguished, with eidetic memory referring to the ability to see an object for a few minutes after it is no longer present[2][3] and photographic memory referring to the ability to recall pages of text or numbers, or similar, in great detail.[4][5] When the concepts are distinguished, eidetic memory is reported
[01:45:31] <manicennui> to occur in a small number of children and generally not found in adults,[2][6] while true photographic memory has never been demonstrated to exist.[5][7]"
[01:45:53] <companion_cube> except in my smartphone I guess ü§î
[01:46:09] <dminkovsky> hahaha
[01:46:13] * manicennui drops companion_cube's phone in the toilet
[01:46:30] <dminkovsky> that's quite rude
[01:47:29] <companion_cube> wow, assassinating the only known photographic memory
[01:47:35] <companion_cube> that's rude indeed
[01:49:05] <manicennui> I can't have any evidence around.
[01:50:51] <indigo> Heh, I love it when people ask me for rough time estimates
[01:51:02] <indigo> (on stuff that has never been done before)
[01:51:29] <bkero> You can go all agile on them and timebox your resarch time to figure out how long it's going to take
[01:51:34] <bkero> into a "spike"
[01:51:42] <manicennui> Even better if they act like they understand that it is a rough estimate with missing info, and then later get mad if you don't hit it.
[01:51:46] * bkero vomits a little
[01:52:49] <companion_cube> indigo: "rough times may last as long as 10 years"
[01:53:20] <manicennui> Fortunately we just break things down and work on them until product is happy, which almost always means that a bunch of things they thought they wanted are dropped.

[01:54:35] <indigo> Thankfully my team never comes back and actually enforces these
[01:54:38] <manicennui> A few of the songs aren't bad, but none of them are amazing.
[01:54:43] <manicennui> A few are terrible.
[01:55:29] <manicennui> I've never heard a Lil Nas X song that I liked other than Old-Town Road.
[01:55:38] <manicennui> The rest of his music is terrible.
[01:56:29] <gwozniak> We have to deal with stuff like, "How long will it take to get code size down?"
[01:56:46] <gwozniak> Basically a research question to which I just make up shit to answer
[01:57:01] <gwozniak> And I'm fine with that.  Some people aren't
[01:57:14] <companion_cube> remove a whitespace from some comment, and voil√†
[01:57:17] <companion_cube> code size is down
[02:01:39] <manicennui> Then key is to add a lot of useless comments now that you can remove later.
[02:01:51] <manicennui> comments.c
[02:02:03] <manicennui> Paste in pages and pages of lorem ipsum.
[02:02:19] <gwozniak> Add comments to the ELF file, then remove them.  Huge savings.
[02:06:10] <manicennui> "The grammys are basically what the Oscars would be if they just nominated every marvel movie for picture of the year. How its considered the pinnacle of music is beyond me. It's just something record companies can use to market their pop stars. 'GRAMMY AWARD WINNING' 'GRAMMY NOMINATED It's dumb and means nothing to me.
[02:06:10] <indigo> gwozniak: Yeah I just either go "one day, one week, or one month"
[02:06:19] <indigo> Eg. "talk to me after this amount of time if it's still not done yet"
[02:07:35] <dminkovsky> well so how long will it take?
[02:07:46] <indigo> One month
[02:07:53] <dminkovsky> sounds good
[02:08:53] <manicennui> I tried to convince our product managers that they could just use an estimate of 6 months for everything.
[02:09:05] <manicennui> It will often be high, but there are few things that we can't complete in 6 months.
[02:09:32] <manicennui> For some reason they didn't go for it.
[02:19:15] <indigo> manicennui: You can... complete things in six months??? Lucky bastards
[02:19:32] <indigo> I've been working on the same projects for over a year now
[02:19:46] <indigo> Large Company Speed‚Ñ¢
[02:19:58] <manicennui> Unless you make the description super vague.
[02:20:21] <manicennui> I mean technically we have been re-architecting our underwriting for over a year now, but it is really a series of small projects.
[02:20:36] <manicennui> Nothing gets done if you approach it as big projects.
[02:21:19] <manicennui> Unless a regulation requires it, or we are going to make a fuckton of money, we basically never do projects that are going to take more than a couple months.
[02:21:36] <manicennui> But we can break a "project" down into multiple smaller projects and do those.
[02:21:52] <manicennui> And often parts of it will never be done because they weren't actually that important.

[03:00:59] <indigo> manicennui: Good point.
[03:01:42] <indigo> I think my project stages might not be granular enough
[03:02:05] <indigo> But the other problem is that one is essentially a research project, and the other is mired in politics
[03:05:29] <manicennui> We are pretty focused on making money and complying with regulations. I don't deal with a lot of politics fortunately.
[03:06:35] <manicennui> I think some of our shared service teams are a bit more political because they don't always work on things that are super important to the business.

[03:12:04] <manicennui> Probably a third of my week is meetings, but I'm a lead.
[03:12:29] <manicennui> The real problem is that they are split up in a way that I don't have a lot of good chunks of time to spend doing other work.

[08:49:08] <imode> huh.
[08:49:14] <imode> this does not look terrible.
[08:51:21] <manicennui> All languages are terrible.
[08:51:42] <imode> it looks like it just piggybacks onto C, which is.. alright, I guess. compiling to C isn't the worst thing, but I'd like something freestanding eventually.
[08:52:02] <manicennui> Might as well use zig.
[08:52:18] <imode> zig looks like a worse rust.
[08:52:33] <manicennui> Doesn't look very rust-like at all.
[08:52:36] <manicennui> More like better C.
[08:52:59] <companion_cube> nim is kind of interesting
[08:53:03] * imode shrugs.
[08:53:08] <imode> nim looks cooler.
[08:53:10] <companion_cube> but I think the author doesn't value much stability or compiler robustness
[08:53:15] <companion_cube> it's also a very very large language.
[08:53:42] <imode> really? large? it doesn't look too huge.
[08:53:52] <companion_cube> well, there's a whole thing about macros
[08:54:17] <companion_cube> there's templates, generics, pragmas to change stuff
[08:54:18] <imode> that imo is.. good. it means you can grow a language.
[08:54:20] <companion_cube> compile time evaluation
[08:54:43] <imode> I'll need to hold my praise for when I actually try it.
[08:54:49] <imode> it doesn't look like it sucks.
[08:54:51] <companion_cube> when a language is this large, imho, it's better if there's a few foundational themes underneath (it's the case for rust!)
[08:55:02] <companion_cube> (or OCaml, heh)
[08:55:16] <imode> it looks like they're there.
[08:55:47] <companion_cube> yeah but check stability, backward compatibility promises (none, afaik), compiler robustness
[08:55:55] <companion_cube> I tried it a bit and it's very nice to write, tbh.
[08:56:06] <companion_cube> it also doesn't feel super solid, although I'm spoiled on that front.
[08:56:19] <imode> I'd probably bail out on it, then.
[08:57:46] <imode> is D still a thing.
[08:57:52] <companion_cube> D is still a thing, yeah
[08:57:58] <companion_cube> nim and D are kind of competitors I guess
[08:58:03] <companion_cube> but D is in gcc now
[08:58:06] <imode> I've been waiting to use that language for 10 years.
[08:59:06] <imode> that is a _large_ language.
[09:00:29] <companion_cube> they're also struggling to catch up with rust, btw :)
[09:00:39] <companion_cube> trying to introduce a borrow checker equivalent
[09:00:49] <imode> borrow checkers are overrated.
[09:01:26] <gwozniak> I dunno. Borrow checkers feel like the right idea for systems programming

[09:02:03] <gwozniak> For the little I've dipped my toes in Rust, it seems like the way to go
[09:03:21] <manicennui> Most people don't need manual memory management at all.

[12:49:55] <bkero> lol posix
[12:49:59] <bkero> pretty awful standard
[12:53:46] <gerikson> how dare you sir
[12:54:19] <riv> there is a weird obsession with hypothetical portability
[12:54:32] <riv> it's totally divorced from reality, there isn't even a pure POSIX shell
[12:54:36] <riv> every shell has weird addons
[12:54:59] <epilys> https://anathema.tade.link/
[12:54:59] <buttsbot> anathema
[12:56:03] <gerikson> yeah POSIX is pretty bad
[12:56:13] <bkero> POSIX requires sccs
[12:56:18] <bkero> Do you know what sccs is?
[12:56:33] <gerikson> imho Linux and BSDs should define a new expanded set of capabilities
[12:56:39] <bkero> and a bunch of dumb shit like that
[12:56:40] <gerikson> bkero: it's a vcs
[12:57:08] <gerikson> because frankly the unix world is Linux now w/ some small seasoning of BSD
[12:57:24] <bkero> Don't tell Oracle that
[12:57:38] <gerikson> how much does Oracle care about Solaris
[13:00:36] <bkero> Non-zero
[13:00:39] <bkero> which is more than anywhere else
[13:02:02] <gerikson> is HP-SUX still around
[13:05:36] <gerikson> it's probably cheaper for Oracle to modify slowlaris to handle Linux stuff than to try to force people to use POSIX

[16:31:35] <buttsbot> Twitter - KetanJ0 - I continue to be blown away by just how intensely and openly shite the metaverse is. It just stinks. It is a 4cm layer of mud. ...
[16:33:07] <riv> I'm concerned about adverts in VR
[16:37:32] <bontaq> Ever since I read an article about people trying to grope women in VR, my hopes have been in the shitter
[16:39:07] <letoram> adverts have the whole 'not hiding in plain sight'ness of product placement though, so easily swappable for family/meme pictures of the day
[16:39:29] <letoram> 'invading personal space' abuse was day one vrchat stuff
[16:39:51] <bontaq> which replaced my concerns about ads in VR, instead it can be even worse!
[16:40:04] <letoram> haven't kept updated (Xe?) but isn't there just an adjustable cutoff distance?
[16:40:24] <bontaq> oh I bet, I just had never considered it before but now it seems obvious
[16:40:34] <letoram> indeed - bio-/psychometrics is where the real horrorshow begins
[16:41:20] <letoram> who doesn't want to have product (or anti-product) placement in the voice, maneurism and overall gestahlt of a dead loved one that made the mistake of oversharing/being present on any social media?
[16:44:17] <riv> remember that bit in accelerando or whatever, where everyones visual augments are hacked and display popup ads all the time
[16:44:23] <riv> well, we can make that a reality
[16:44:41] <riv> except it wont even required hacking it'll just be the new normal
[17:06:22] <companion_cube> letoram: "hi, it's grandpa. Don't worry, viagra is super safe!"
[17:08:58] <letoram> companion_cube: "I forgive your previous transgressions and the .. exotic choices of erotic VR stimulants if you would just renew your subscription for xyz. Oh and your <insert dead family pet> is safe and happy with me here in heaven."
[17:10:01] <skyl4rk> as long as you keep bying ghost kibble nfts that is
[17:10:15] <companion_cube> oh god
[17:10:40] <companion_cube> and of course it's all based on data leaked or shadily bought
[17:11:05] <companion_cube> so "dead family pet" would be a long base64 blob extracted from "security questions" üòÇ
[17:12:00] <bontaq> or it could be based on it scanning your room :P
[17:13:58] <skyl4rk> it's no longer in the shade it is bought when we are TOS required to 24/365 feed into a sun of broadcast personal data
[17:20:41] <skyl4rk> nonparticipation options are to die on a hill or live under a rock

[17:29:21] <companion_cube> shit, I'd rather have a searchable catalog
[17:29:23] <companion_cube> wtf
[17:29:53] <gwozniak> Why the fuck would I want to push a cart around to shop in a virtual world?
[17:30:16] <companion_cube> ikr???
[17:30:24] <gwozniak> The whole thing just reeks of shit
[17:30:35] <companion_cube> at this rate, I imagine online schools will feature online school shootings

[17:33:57] <companion_cube> skyl4rk: the good news is, you don't have to do it yourself
[17:34:06] <companion_cube> you can have a virtual instacart person do it for you
[17:34:18] <companion_cube> (a real human, ofc, doing a gig on the metaverse)
[17:35:20] <skyl4rk> no, /you/ are the personal shopper, you get to do all the cart pushing
[17:35:21] <companion_cube> classic shopping cart, 928$
[17:36:22] <companion_cube> I mean there are many opportunities for grifters at least
[17:36:34] <companion_cube> if you hack the thing, you can release virtual zombies into the virtual wallmart
[17:36:40] <companion_cube> for an enhances shopping experience‚Ñ¢
[17:36:46] <skyl4rk> they will even fuzz the user input/walk direction mapping a bit to simulate that one wonky wheel. *so realistic*
[17:37:24] <gerikson> lol skyl4rk
[17:39:35] <companion_cube> awesome
[17:39:45] <companion_cube> "you have an adblocker, your wheel is now squeaky"
[17:42:23] <skyl4rk> your total is less than <<threshold value>> there is now a crying baby in the cart child seat
[17:49:33] <gwozniak> Escaping reality is going to be worse than reality
[17:51:02] <riv> haha
[17:51:19] <riv> the metaverse is going to be so shit that people start reading books again
[17:51:24] <companion_cube> there's one benefit though: no other customers wearing their mask under their nose
[17:51:44] <skyl4rk> hm, or, get a subsidized child vr set and bring your child when shopping for a 10% discount and teach your child valuable shopping skills of the future
[17:52:09] <riv> more like teaching them the old ways, that are no longer relevant in society
[17:52:32] <gwozniak> We had a site for $work that we could visit to reset our password in case we got locked out or when we were forced to because of passwor policies.  It's been shut down without much warning and now the procedure to reset is... less simple
[17:53:03] <gwozniak> Add to that the instructions on the help page for it are incredibly poorly written
[17:53:45] <gwozniak> I feel for the tech support people, but they really do dig their own graves sometimes
[17:54:44] <gwozniak> They did this over the holidays and left off instructions for anyone using Linux or Mac machines
[17:54:53] <riv> damn
[17:54:56] <riv> they really did do that to themselves
[17:56:07] <skyl4rk> how about the corporate information search engine, and the it portal, being accessible once you log in to the intranet, and if you are locked out, you can't use them to find how to get back in ...I mean it makes sense to have that kind of protection, but as a user the solution is "don't get locked out, ever" ...hm so mission accomplished I guess ...sneaky
[17:59:05] <gwozniak> You do have to be logged into the VPN to change your password.  With the password policy stuff it's not so bad because you get lots of email warnings.  But the website updated things pretty fast.  When you do it from your local machine, it is often the case that services like Jira get the change but your local machine doesn't
[18:00:48] <gwozniak> I mean, the help page literally has a screenshot from Active Directory admin or Excel (I can't tell) showing spreadsheet of the password policies.  It is not intuitive at all
[18:00:59] <gwozniak> The whole page is littered with that kind of stuff
[18:01:45] <gwozniak> And the Mac screenshots they just added yesterday are for some version that no one runs
[18:03:08] <gwozniak> Plus, they constantly refer to it as an "Active Directory password".  This terminology no one but IT/IS people use internally
[18:03:16] <gwozniak> s/This/This is/
[18:04:09] <gwozniak> If they called it your "coporate login" or "company credentials", most everyone would know what that meant
[18:04:11] <skyl4rk> ah, the good old, the ol' the-options-in-the-instructions are not the-options-I get-in-the-application, love that one
[18:05:02] <gwozniak> I mean, I can navigate it and know what to do because I have some passing familiarity with that stuff.
[18:05:04] <gwozniak> But...
[18:05:42] <gwozniak> And even then, I'm wondering, "Am I missing something?"
[18:06:11] <gwozniak> So, kudos to the IS folks for likely giving themselves a lot of work
[18:06:38] <skyl4rk> I find that my expectation on certain terminology confuses me when things are worded slightly different, compared to if I had no experience and/or expectations at all.
[18:07:11] <riv> i think im going to start calling it 'facebooks metaverse'

[18:16:41] <skyl4rk> I've never really understood the [meme] difficulty of understanding the concept of pointers, double/triple/casting/etc in C, sure, but that's C. I wonder if it would help to first understand that all computer memory is basically address+data+write strobe, or address+read strobe->data out.
[18:17:09] <skyl4rk> but then again, I still don't understand monads I guess
[18:17:25] <letoram> all of computing is CLK -> misery -> CLK
[18:19:23] <companion_cube> skyl4rk: people used to saner languages are surprised by how fucked up C is ;)
[18:19:42] <companion_cube> show them 4[arr] is the same as arr[4] and they'll just be (rightly) mad
[18:20:59] <skyl4rk> yes, but as I said, such things are warts (or features!!) of C, not pointers
[18:21:26] <companion_cube> sure
[18:21:34] <riv> is misery occurring on the rising edge or falling?
[18:21:35] <skyl4rk> although I guess, C is the main (only?) language with prominent use of pointers
[18:21:59] <companion_cube> C is probably the main one where pointer arithmetic is so prevalent
[18:22:18] <companion_cube> but most languages require you to understand the concept of "by reference", at least. even java.
[18:22:46] <letoram> riv: decomposite it into enthusiasm on the rising, and realism on the falling?
[18:22:53] <riv> :)
[18:24:08] <letoram> gets the anthropomorphism of the processor in play - an endless stream of 'woohoo I get to compu.. what the fuck did you just ask me to do?'
[18:24:28] <skyl4rk> misery needs to have stabilized (stagnated?) at the time of the rising edge, after which there is a tumultous period where it's both miserable and wrong, until it stabilizes through gate bureaucracy which can be accepted as state on the next rising edge

[19:06:38] <Xe> letoram: yeah there's usually an adjustable cutoff distance, however i have my friends exempted from the "personal space" mode
[19:06:51] <Xe> so my friends can grope me all they want
[19:07:00] <Xe> furry culture is very gay
[19:09:31] <Xe> bontaq: usually it helps to be PCVR and then use an avatar that's totemmo kawaii, but not compatible with quest and then make your fallback avatar something androygnous/semi-masc so the groping kiddies with quest 2's just see something vaguely masculine coded and do not engage
[19:10:36] <Xe> and stay out of public worlds to begin with
[19:20:48] <epilys> haha all that sounds wonderfully weird (in a good way)
[19:22:08] <companion_cube> manicennui: re what you said on manual memory management, it's still useful for lower level stuff, it seems
[19:22:15] <companion_cube> like, ripgrep for example
[19:22:22] <companion_cube> low latency network servers, too
[19:22:26] <manicennui> companion_cube: Very few people are doing work where it is necessary.
[19:22:34] <manicennui> And it doesn't come for free.
[19:22:44] <ngoldbaum> ugh i need a haircut bad
[19:22:45] <companion_cube> not for free, and probably not useful for most, say, websites
[19:22:51] <companion_cube> useful for other domains, though
[19:23:01] <companion_cube> if you do games or computer graphics, say?
[19:23:20] <manicennui> I've seen geeks spend far too much time rewriting shit in something else because "it's faster", and the original code was not at all optimized, and was not actually the bottleneck.
[19:23:29] <manicennui> It's just a convenient excuse to waste time.
[19:23:39] <manicennui> Most games don't even need it.
[19:23:51] <manicennui> As evident by the popularity of Unity.
[19:24:00] <indigo> manicennui: It grinds my gears when someone does a rewrite for performance reasons, without profiling what was slow in the first place
[19:24:43] <companion_cube> manicennui: C# allows you to go pretty low level, to be fair
[19:25:03] <companion_cube> last night I was reading that Team Cherry (Hollow Knight) had to call outside experts to optimize their game for the switch :D
[19:25:08] <companion_cube> (game in Unity)
[19:25:14] <companion_cube> so, you know, it can make sense
[19:25:23] <epilys> would like to know how much that cost
[19:25:25] <companion_cube> of course in many cases, Go would be plenty fast
[19:25:36] <manicennui> Optimize doesn't necessarily mean manually manage memory.
[19:25:56] <companion_cube> no,  but it can be very useful
[19:26:16] <manicennui> I feel like we are just talking in circles now.
[19:26:26] <manicennui> No one is claiming that there is never a need for manual memory management.
[19:26:43] <manicennui> Just that those cases are basically non-existent for the vast majority of us.
[19:26:45] <companion_cube> you're claiming it's rarely useful, I disagree, none of us has numbers
[19:26:47] <companion_cube> :)
[19:26:55] <companion_cube> truly depends on the domain
[19:27:27] <manicennui> There are far more people employed writing business crud apps, probably with a web interface, than anything else.
[19:27:47] <companion_cube> yeah probably
[19:28:10] <prussian> the answer is simple.... rewrite it in rust.
[19:28:11] <companion_cube> but there are entire domains where it can make sense, including embedded (heh), games, graphics, HPC, unix tools
[19:28:29] <companion_cube> maybe in raw number of developers they 're smaller, but they're not insignificant
[19:28:29] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[19:28:58] <manicennui> companion_cube: I'm not trying to speak to everyone's experience.
[19:28:58] <epilys> in general generalizing is bad
[19:29:12] <manicennui> I've spent my entire career doing web crap where people chase shiny bullshit.
[19:29:18] <companion_cube> you said "very few people"
[19:29:23] <companion_cube> I disputed that.
[19:29:23] <manicennui> I don't even trust the people I work with to write managed code well.
[19:29:29] <manicennui> companion_cube: As a percentage.
[19:29:42] <companion_cube> does any of us have numbers?
[19:30:07] <companion_cube> even if you look at lobste.rs I think the percentages are quite skewed away from webdevs
[19:30:07] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[19:30:13] <companion_cube> stfu buttsbot
[19:30:24] <manicennui> lobsters/hn are not representative of anything.
[19:30:46] <manicennui> Most developers don't even know what they are.
[19:31:06] <companion_cube> and they don't need to hear about rust
[19:31:33] <indigo> Everyone needs to hear about Rust. It's the only moral way
[19:31:37] <companion_cube> but then why do we even talk about 95% of the content on lobste.rs ? it's even more niche
[19:31:42] * manicennui is a sinner
[19:31:49] <manicennui> companion_cube: Because we are nerds
[19:32:08] <manicennui> Has any discussion here ever convinced anyone of anything?
[19:32:16] <companion_cube> sure, sometimes
[19:32:25] <indigo> Just because you sling shitcode at work doesn't mean that you can't be interested in some weird/cool shit at home
[19:32:26] <companion_cube> feel free to disagree ;)
[19:32:30] <manicennui> Have we converted any dynamically typed people to statically typed?
[19:32:38] <companion_cube> yes, look at TS :p
[19:32:42] <manicennui> Look at the things we discuss most often. They lead nowhere.
[19:32:51] <manicennui> This is just a social channel for people with similar interests.
[19:32:55] <companion_cube> or even the influx of people from ruby/python to Go
[19:33:03] <indigo> Speaking of, how is that Vue rewrite going manicennui
[19:33:07] <manicennui> No discussion here convinced someone to switch to TS.
[19:33:20] <manicennui> indigo: Fortunately I'm not involved. My team is strictly backend now.
[19:33:31] <companion_cube> oh you meant did *we* convert anyone here
[19:33:33] <companion_cube> no idea.
[19:33:36] <manicennui> And people continue to struggle with setting up the frontend, and it produces lots of new bugs.
[19:33:44] <indigo> That's where I like to be; frontend seems like a tire fire
[19:33:48] <manicennui> companion_cube: My point is that you are taking this conversation too seriously.
[19:34:15] <companion_cube> ah well
[19:35:00] <manicennui> It is certainly a common experience among those of us writing web-based business software that geeks rewrite things without much thought other than, "I want to use the new thing!"
[19:35:15] <manicennui> Then rationalize it with bullshit.
[19:35:46] <epilys> I read similar statements on HN all the time
[19:36:11] <manicennui> We recently spent far, far too long dealing with a simple change because someone decided it would be best to use protobufs unnecessarily.
[19:36:19] <manicennui> And the reason they gave was absolutely performance.
[19:36:29] <indigo> Hahahah
[19:36:39] <indigo> manicennui: Did they give the argument "it's good enough for Google"
[19:36:46] <manicennui> And they left the company, so they don't even have to suffer.
[19:37:03] <manicennui> indigo: Nah, this person just loved overly complicated solutions.
[19:37:14] <indigo> Sounds like a Xoogler to me
[19:37:16] <manicennui> We are slowly rewriting everything he wrote.
[19:37:20] <manicennui> It's absolute garbage.
[19:37:53] <manicennui> Unfortunately he was on a team that did nothing but rewrites.
[19:38:15] <manicennui> And they sold business on rewriting a very important system, but it turns out we gained none of the benefits they promised.
[19:38:34] <manicennui> It was supposed to be simplified in a way that analytics could take over the main logic.
[19:38:57] <manicennui> Instead, we still have to make changes, changes are much more difficult, and it is (without exaggeration) an order of magnitude slower.
[19:39:29] <Geekingfrog> are the changes more difficult only because of protobuf ?
[19:40:16] <manicennui> No, the code is also spread among a bunch of lambdas written in Go, and the entire process relies on this gnarly decision table at the end that no one can reason about because it is about 15 columns wide.
[19:41:18] <manicennui> The lambdas are mostly code dealing with data structures, marshalling/unmarshalling, and error handling.
[19:41:25] <manicennui> Then a few lines of actual business logic.
[19:42:05] <companion_cube> so you're blaming protobuf for something else? :)
[19:42:12] <gerikson> JFC https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29810618
[19:42:13] <buttsbot> Hacker News
[19:42:17] <gerikson> oh, dead
[19:42:18] <gerikson> good
[19:42:21] <manicennui> No, the particular change recently was a protobuf problem.
[19:42:28] <manicennui> We needed to change an int to a float.
[19:42:39] <manicennui> Which you obviously can't do and be backward compatible.
[19:42:56] <companion_cube> is Joe Rogan the new alex jones?
[19:43:19] <manicennui> So we added a new field, then had to modify multiple systems to handle it.
[19:43:39] <manicennui> Systems and lambdas.
[19:43:56] <companion_cube> I mean‚Ä¶ you'd have to suffer through a breaking change in any case, no?
[19:44:03] <manicennui> Nope.
[19:44:29] <Geekingfrog> from my experience, having the entire logic distributed across many systems/aws lambda makes theses changes a lot more painful
[19:45:09] <manicennui> Geekingfrog: They specifically made each lambda do too little, which led to far too many lambdas.
[19:45:12] <companion_cube> manicennui: if you change the type, how is not breaking
[19:45:18] <companion_cube> yeah, blame the lambdas
[19:45:33] <manicennui> companion_cube: In dynamic languages, it would not cause problems in most cases, including this one.
[19:45:40] <manicennui> Arithmetic would have been fine.
[19:45:57] <companion_cube> just praying your integers were actually small enough!
[19:46:09] <manicennui> In this case they are tiny.
[19:46:24] <manicennui> Less than 1000 in all cases.
[19:46:30] <companion_cube> and the floats?
[19:46:37] <manicennui> The same.
[19:46:42] <manicennui> They just want more precision.
[19:46:51] <companion_cube> what does that even mean
[19:47:01] <manicennui> It means that instead of 1 they want to send 1.05
[19:47:18] <companion_cube> well I guess it works in dynamic languages, heh
[19:47:30] <companion_cube> if you have any static one it'd fail so hard
[19:48:44] <manicennui> And I wasn't blaming lambdas themselves, although they have numerous downsides.
[19:48:57] <manicennui> The type of people who love using lambdas also tend to create messes.
[19:49:04] <manicennui> Because they aren't using them to solve a real problem.
[19:49:11] <manicennui> It's developer playtime and resume building.
[19:49:31] <companion_cube> seems like the lambdas were the thing making the upgrade difficult
[19:49:34] <manicennui> The system they replaced was all within a monolith.
[19:50:00] <manicennui> companion_cube: I'm pretty sure it would have been easier with JSON too.
[19:50:21] <manicennui> I think Go's JSON parsing will do the right thing if you try to unmarshall a float into an int, but I haven't tested it.
[19:50:26] <companion_cube> you woudn't even have noticed the breaking change for Go!
[19:50:30] <manicennui> "right"
[19:50:34] <companion_cube> there is no right thing  then
[19:50:45] <companion_cube> how are you supposed to deserialize 1.05 into an int
[19:50:47] <companion_cube> it's a bug
[19:53:06] <letoram> Xe: is there any FFXIV character/model/housing import/export in use? seems that would be the easier mainstream 'transition' platform given the efforts that players put into housing and aesthetics there, and the increased impact of models/architecture in VR
[19:54:12] <Xe> letoram: not aware, but see if anyone has done vtubing with FFXIV characters, that may hold the ticket there
[19:56:03] <letoram> I think the popular ones use much more templated/anime:y than trying to map their avatars, though one of the ffxiv vtubers explicitly doesn't show in game footage as that is considered to personal to her
[19:56:57] <manicennui> Looks like Go won't do it. It sets it to the default value (0).

[19:57:49] <prussian> lol'd
[19:58:13] <Xe> letoram: i actually use my VRChat avatar for vtubing (https://christine.website/blog/vrchat-avatar-to-vrm-vtubing-2022-01-02)
[19:58:19] <letoram> seen model importers/exporters in various shapes/forms, so quite doable - but my interests are more academic, values in VR is enhancing appreciation of reality and all that, in my case finding non-native representations for grok:ing and transforming larger and larger quantites of data compared to say, virtual social-space or 'more screen estate in computing'
[19:58:19] <prussian> I guess I don't know what go could do sans returning an error at least?
[19:58:32] <letoram> Xe: yeah read/liked it
[19:59:04] <manicennui> prussian: I'm guessing that some languages will do implicit type conversion.

[19:59:35] <buttsbot> Go Playground - The Go Programming Language
[19:59:40] <prussian> in fairness, it does error at least.
[20:00:48] <manicennui> Technically all numbers in JSON are floats.
[20:00:52] <manicennui> So...
[20:01:42] <Brekkjern> And some strings are bools
[20:01:43] <prussian> i thought json numbers could basically be arbitrary precision and unbound outside of reality (memory)
[20:02:07] <prussian> idk. json is the devil, no?
[20:02:48] <companion_cube> manicennui: idk what you were expecting :p
[20:03:03] <companion_cube> float to int is not a conversion anyway
[20:03:08] <Xe> letoram: it's so annoying how hard it is to do this stuff though
[20:04:07] <manicennui> companion_cube: Again, it would be fine in most dynamic languages.
[20:04:27] <manicennui> And I bet we can find some library in Java that will do it.

[20:05:58] <manicennui> WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?
[20:06:01] <companion_cube> manicennui: the dynlangs would also not complain if it were an array
[20:06:07] <prussian> rip...
[20:06:24] <prussian> json do be like that.
[20:06:44] <companion_cube> manicennui: yet another stupid java library design choice
[20:08:01] <prussian> we must rewrite everything in Rust. It's the only way.
[20:08:18] <riv> I think numbers in json are floats
[20:08:30] <riv> not srue
[20:08:32] <riv> sure*
[20:09:04] <companion_cube> they're unbounded floats, even
[20:09:10] <companion_cube> the spec doesn't talk at all about limits :s
[20:09:25] <prussian> https://www.json.org/img/number.png the railroad diagram seems to suggest ya...
[20:09:28] <prussian> what companion_cube
[20:09:32] <prussian> that's what I assumed as well
[20:09:43] <companion_cube> which means, I think, that JS just cannot parse json
[20:09:45] <prussian> it's basically some arbitrary precision, ascii form of BCD
[20:10:24] <letoram> Xe: display hardware / input interfaces in an incredible turnoff, everything is volatile, semi- or completely- proprietary and links together hardware/software-wise really poorly. Vertical integration has such a strong advantage. Most Khronos specs fizzle out, OpenXR seems headed that way
[20:10:30] <prussian> that's why you see some people throw you big fat ints as strings, hell I think those json struct tags in go has some behavior for that use case.
[20:10:31] <prussian> lmao
[20:10:52] <companion_cube> ints as strings is a safer way yes
[20:10:58] <riv> yikes
[20:11:06] <riv> that's so like
[20:11:09] <riv> bad
[20:11:19] <Xe> letoram: yeah, as much as it sucks that the quest 2 is probably one of the best VR experiences around, it really is lol
[20:11:30] <companion_cube> json, this simple format that requires bindings to a arbitrary precision floating point library ;)
[20:11:46] <letoram> how is JS on locale for strings<->float in respect to RADIX_POINT?
[20:11:47] <riv> but floats can represent integers ok
[20:11:55] <riv> so i dont know why you'd need to store your ints as strings?
[20:11:56] <Xe> it's a fully vertically integrated environment with predictable hardware
[20:11:57] <manicennui> Sounds like serde in Rust was doing implicit float to int conversion, but they removed it.
[20:12:02] <companion_cube> good
[20:12:15] <companion_cube> riv: floats cannot store all int64

[20:12:27] <riv> ah right, the very large numbers
[20:12:36] <prussian> we must return to xml
[20:12:36] <manicennui> companion_cube: Yes, but it proves that many people see this as a valid thing to do.
[20:12:50] <riv> maybe just JSON plus integers
[20:13:06] <letoram> Xe: I lobbied for such an integration at sony-mobile back in 2012 .. it was rejected on grounds of that being playstation territory and not fit for mobile
[20:14:04] <companion_cube> manicennui: they start by dooing it, and then realize it's braindead
[20:14:20] <manicennui> Sounds like people couldn't agree about how to do it.
[20:14:43] <manicennui> Which is a valid opinion, but obviously many people saw it as something desirable.
[20:17:12] <letoram> Xe: I doubt any open effort will manage to get close to the advantage quest has now, fully hardware - trivial usb-hid interface for inside-out might return some balance
[20:18:37] <letoram> the disadvantage for social is the whole 'they can only deliver the bland crotchless' crap that is all of fb-meta/ms-teams, and psvr2 will pluck the gaming side (give or take supply-issues)

[20:28:44] <companion_cube> sounds like it'll be episode 4 of libertarians vs bears
[20:28:54] <prussian> it literally only gets more amazing.
[20:29:01] <prussian> this is beautiful.
[20:30:06] <imode> tHEY HAVE A DISCORD
[20:30:15] <Brekkjern> Everyone has a discord.
[20:30:19] <Brekkjern> I have several.
[20:30:24] <Brekkjern> For random reasons
[20:30:52] <companion_cube> "a crypto DJ" I'm losing it
[20:30:59] <companion_cube> if I understood what the guy said
[20:31:09] <imode> oh good lord.
[20:31:11] <imode> it is real.
[20:31:18] <prussian> lmao. the Wham! song in the background at the restaurant.
[20:31:51] <companion_cube> there's no way
[20:31:53] <companion_cube> it must be a parody
[20:32:06] <imode> it. is. real.
[20:32:22] <companion_cube> the talking bitcoin is killing me
[20:34:17] <bontaq> hahaha yes. YES!!
[20:34:31] <bontaq> I've been missing insane islands since reddit island fell apart
[20:34:45] <imode> reddit island?
[20:35:06] <imode> why are we destroying tropical habitats for memes.
[20:35:23] <imode> can anybody who does that just like, swallow a bomb.
[20:35:24] <letoram> maybe make this thing into a pinball machine, only a single unit, sell it at 10x cost and have the final wizard mode being mr hanky screaming at you

[20:39:42] <companion_cube> sorry, I can't believe it
[20:39:46] <companion_cube> "destress room"
[20:40:36] <imode> whoever thinks any of this is a solid idea, please go tie an anvil to your leg and try to breathe underwater.
[20:40:54] <Brekkjern> An anvil, or an anvil like object?
[20:40:58] <Brekkjern> Or does it not matter?
[20:41:06] <defect> or let it play out for the enjoyment of everyone else :)
[20:41:07] <Brekkjern> Anvils are expensive yo
[20:41:07] <imode> non-fungible anvils.
[20:41:24] <imode> defect: no, I'd rather none of these idiots touch potential habitats.
[20:41:30] <imode> I would rather they die broke and alone.
[20:41:30] <companion_cube> imode: you'd have to be super naive
[20:41:41] <companion_cube> this ad is for schmuckz
[20:41:44] <imode> companion_cube: you underestimate the general population.
[20:41:54] <companion_cube> people rich enough to pay for this shit?
[20:42:11] <imode> according to their discord, it's not a particularly high bar.
[20:42:32] <companion_cube> "not a fan of forks"
[20:42:40] <imode> hope they like spoons.
[20:43:07] <prussian> sporks*
[20:43:34] <companion_cube> hard sporking ethereum
[20:43:41] <companion_cube> oh no, a song
[20:43:44] <companion_cube> I can't
[20:46:06] <imode> outlawing crypto can't come fast enough.
[20:48:06] <companion_cube> the bitconnect part seems to really be parody
[20:55:14] <prussian> I'm really afraid that this isn't a joke.
[20:55:26] <prussian> like the whole end of the video is like "The making of"
[20:56:26] <indigo> > How to design a house to last 1000 years
[20:56:28] <indigo> Oh, HN
[21:01:28] <manicennui> Seems like some European countries build housing that will probably last a century, but in the US we seem to aim for 30-50 years.
[21:01:31] <manicennui> With problems the entire time.
[21:02:23] <manicennui> Someone on IRC from Germany was showing me some photos of the walls being constructed for an apartment building, and it was way beyond what we would do in the US.
[21:02:45] <Brekkjern> My flat is from the 70's, and apart from the insulation being a bit meh, it's fine.
[21:03:01] <epilys> US doesn't do reinforced concrete?
[21:03:09] <epilys> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian_hypothesis
[21:03:09] <buttsbot> Silurian hypothesis - Wikipedia
[21:03:13] <manicennui> epilys: For taller buildings, sure.
[21:03:54] <epilys> Primitive.
[21:03:59] <manicennui> The building I'm in is 100+ years old, and the shell is brick, but we do less of this kind of building today.
[21:04:27] <manicennui> But that's because so many buildings were rebuilt in brick after the fire.
[21:04:44] <manicennui> When they do brick buildings today, it is just one layer on the outside.
[21:05:09] <companion_cube> prussian: I'm worried too
[21:05:13] <ngoldbaum> epilys: most of the new construction around here is one story of thinnish concrete, 4-5 story concrete elevator shaft, then plywood and 2x4 wood construction on top of the concrete platform
[21:05:38] <ngoldbaum> it‚Äôs fire safe because of the fire suppression systems but without that they‚Äôd burn to the ground on a dime
[21:05:55] <manicennui> The photos of the walls the guy from Germany showed me were impressive.
[21:06:06] <bontaq> ah yes the 5 over 1 hell scape https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-over-1
[21:06:07] <buttsbot> 5-over-1 - Wikipedia
[21:07:52] <manicennui> It would be nice not to be able to hear one's neighbors easily.
[21:08:17] <indigo> manicennui: If I ever do end up buying a house, I want it to have no shared walls
[21:08:43] <ngoldbaum> i‚Äôm in a duplex and can‚Äôt hear my neighbors at all through the walls
[21:08:46] <ngoldbaum> it is possible
[21:08:49] <manicennui> I plan to be about an acre away from my neighbors.
[21:08:59] <manicennui> ngoldbaum: Yeah, just doesn't seem common.
[21:09:06] <manicennui> With multi-unit buildings.
[21:10:08] <manicennui> For all I know the rest of the country is very different from here, but I kind of doubt it.
[21:10:49] <epilys> you need soundproofing layers for that even if it's concrete
[21:10:59] <epilys> unfortunately
[21:11:58] <manicennui> Something like this would be perfect: https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/283-Loudville-Rd-Easthampton-MA-01027/57006967_zpid/
[21:11:59] <buttsbot> 283 Loudville Rd, Easthampton, MA 01027 | MLS #72925522 | Zillow
[21:12:17] <manicennui> Would take some work to get it exactly how I want it, but it is livable.
[21:12:35] <indigo> https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/283-Loudville-Rd-Easthampton-MA-01027/57006967_zpid/?mmlb=g,22 wow, who picked this carpet
[21:12:36] <buttsbot> 283 Loudville Rd, Easthampton, MA 01027 | MLS #72925522 | Zillow
[21:12:55] <manicennui> There are some shots of the entire property with an outline of the property line.
[21:13:03] <manicennui> Carpet is easy to change fortunately.
[21:13:09] <bontaq> looks pretty comfy
[21:13:13] <gwozniak> indigo: wow.  That's something special
[21:13:23] <bontaq> that carpet is like the perfect design to contain dirt
[21:13:31] <gwozniak> Reminds me of my childhood
[21:13:34] <epilys> looks like animal crossing terrain
[21:13:40] <manicennui> I actually love the kitchen cabinets, but I'd change the countertops.
[21:13:45] <gwozniak> That childhood being the late 70s and early 80s
[21:14:01] <manicennui> And get an induction stove.
[21:14:41] <manicennui> But it is affordable, has plenty of land, and I could remodel things over time.
[21:15:08] <manicennui> And there are some small mountains nearby
[21:15:49] <manicennui> If I were going to seriously consider that place, I'd have to learn more about the oil heating.
[21:16:40] <prussian> looks nice
[21:16:50] <prussian> oh... oil heating.
[21:17:34] <ngoldbaum> prussian: pretty common in new england
[21:17:40] <prussian> you pay some guy to drop expensive, low quality, dino juice into your underground storage tank or above-ground storage tank.
[21:17:55] <ngoldbaum> iirc it‚Äôs not too expensive to replace one of those systems with a pellet stove
[21:18:02] <indigo> I was reading somewhere that a lot of the old "ghost stories" was probably due to indoor pollution from stoves causing folks to hallucinate
[21:18:16] <manicennui> I'd want to be able to expand the house slightly.
[21:18:33] <manicennui> 1232 square feet is just a bit small.
[21:18:38] <manicennui> ~1500 would be good.
[21:18:39] <prussian> ngoldbaum: ya, it is still a big thing, but the utilities are doing a lot to expand natural gas.
[21:19:00] <prussian> a lot of towns near the big cities got torn up streets full of brand new natural gas hook-ups.
[21:19:18] <prussian> indigo: sounds about right lol.
[21:19:20] <manicennui> I probably won't visit New England until June anyways.
[21:19:27] <manicennui> Mostly just looking at what is available.
[21:20:13] <ngoldbaum> do heat pumps work in places that get really cold?
[21:20:26] <prussian> I imagine so.
[21:20:34] <prussian> I don't know anyone with one though.
[21:20:38] <epilys> this article suggests some japanese folklore is from cat shadows from heating lamps https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2020/09/10/supernatural-cats-japan-history-folklore/viewings/glimpses/
[21:20:39] <buttsbot> The Mystical, Magical, Supernatural Cats of Japan
[21:20:43] <manicennui> Apparently there are heat pumps that can go pretty low, but they need some kind of backup if it gets below about 0F.
[21:21:00] <prussian> last I remember, heating oil was like $4/gal when I had to worry about it.
[21:21:10] <manicennui> Basically just a less efficient electric system.
[21:21:15] <companion_cube> manicennui: https://lobste.rs/s/zzawym :DD timely
[21:21:15] <buttsbot> Memory leaks: the forgotten side of web performance | Lobsters
[21:21:20] <prussian> damn.
[21:21:40] <manicennui> I also want a fireplace with insert or wood stove as a backup.
[21:21:49] <manicennui> That place has a fireplace. I'd get an insert.
[21:22:21] <manicennui> Coworker/friend is asking me to go out for coffee this weekend.
[21:22:30] <manicennui> Does no one care about the pandemic?
[21:22:39] <prussian> nope
[21:22:51] <manicennui> Trying to figure out how to say no without sounding like I'm blowing him off again.
[21:23:01] <prussian> I only knew one person who cared, but her husband also has ALS and she is like 72
[21:23:08] <prussian> so... it isn't that surprising.
[21:24:43] <prussian> manicennui: just say you are taking care of elderly or people with conditions that make them at greater risk of covid.
[21:24:47] <prussian> if they can't understand. idk
[21:24:56] <manicennui> They know that I'm not.
[21:29:24] <bontaq> huh can't you tell them you're waiting this wave out.  I guess you could reschedule for like a couple weeks from now so they don't feel blown't off
[21:30:25] <manicennui> That's basically what I did. He seems good with that.
[21:30:57] <manicennui> He's been asking for a while, but always seems to ask right during a spike.
[21:31:13] <manicennui> And a lot of coffee shops here still don't have indoor dining, which is a pain.
[21:35:51] <indigo> What's the risk factor for outdoor dining? I definitely wouldn't want to do indoor righ tnow
[21:36:55] <manicennui> It's like 15F here.
[21:36:58] <manicennui> I'm not eating outside.
[21:38:57] <indigo> Oh and windy too
[21:38:59] <indigo> Yeah fuck that
[21:40:41] <indigo> Sheesh, already a second person on my team that has tested positive for COVID
[21:40:48] <indigo> Glad I stopped coming in to the office
[21:48:27] <dminkovsky> man that house costs $400k now
[21:48:36] <dminkovsky> a blink of an eye ago that used to cost $150
[21:48:43] <dminkovsky> well, if a blink, maybe $225?
[21:49:09] <dminkovsky> that photo indigo linked too has some intense bracketing with the window
[21:49:28] <indigo> Inflation!
[21:49:54] <dminkovsky> inflation
[21:50:00] <dminkovsky> stagflation
[21:50:08] <dminkovsky> it's when we all become inflatable stags
[21:50:14] <dminkovsky> or something
[21:50:25] <dminkovsky> woah love the basement
[21:50:30] <dminkovsky> that's probably cold as fuck in the winter
[21:50:45] <dminkovsky> no walk out
[21:51:03] <dminkovsky> but that's one less entrance to secure against intruders
[21:51:51] <dminkovsky> vagabonds
[21:52:39] <dminkovsky> move to maryland manicennui
[21:52:47] <dminkovsky> most milktoast state in the country
[21:53:09] <manicennui> Why would I want that?
[21:53:12] <dminkovsky> we're just part of the washington-philly-nyc megapolis
[21:53:17] <dminkovsky> you wouldn't, i think
[21:53:32] <dminkovsky> the DC industrial complex lives here
[21:53:36] <dminkovsky> (and northern VA)
[21:53:45] <manicennui> I'm not sure that intruders are a huge concern in that area.
[21:53:51] <dminkovsky> i was jk
[21:54:28] <dminkovsky> you seem to be looking for a place that's not souleless
[21:54:37] <dminkovsky> but i wonder how you find that
[21:54:43] <skyl4rk> also one less escape route from zombies?
[22:16:35] <dminkovsky> they're inside

[22:20:37] <buttsbot> Twitter - TechEmails - Bill Gates: I'm literally losing sleep over Java  September 30, 1996 https://t.co/u9lduCtkW9
[22:23:17] <manicennui> And Nath responded with, "I'll start a patent troll company and sue them! LOL!"
[22:23:19] <manicennui> Nathan
[22:24:20] <manicennui> I just can't understand the mindset where you worry that someone might create a competitive product.
[22:24:22] <dminkovsky> that thing is rich hold crap
[22:24:26] <dminkovsky> holy*
[22:24:38] <manicennui> I'd assume someone would and try to keep serving the needs of some portion of the population.
[22:24:38] <dminkovsky> i think that's why they're rich though
[22:24:50] <dminkovsky> they've parasitically foisted their products on us
[22:24:52] <manicennui> You can be rich without trying to destroy everything else.
[22:25:08] <dminkovsky> right but then there's these guys
[22:25:19] <dminkovsky> who just want to kill and eat their tech money meat
[22:25:40] <dminkovsky> i like how lost in his reply is that java sucks
[22:25:42] <dminkovsky> don't worry about it bill
[22:25:56] <dminkovsky> it takes 3 minutes to load the JVM in netscape
[22:26:01] <dminkovsky> it not longer
[22:26:03] <dminkovsky> if not*
[22:26:12] <dminkovsky> i remember applets pretty vividly
[22:26:17] <dminkovsky> it's like, bill, just try them out
[22:26:35] <manicennui> Nathan is kind of right though. They didn't get everyone to switch to Solaris.
[22:26:36] <dminkovsky> but the nathan is just making his big bucks playing therapist with rising tides and stuff
[22:26:40] <dminkovsky> he is
[22:26:59] <manicennui> They "cheapened the entire business".
[22:27:06] <dminkovsky> s/lost in his reply/buried in his reply/
[22:27:32] <dminkovsky> i didn't get the netscape/solaris thing actually
[22:27:57] <dminkovsky> what was going on between netscape/solaris then
[22:28:32] <manicennui> I also don't think Java was the biggest driver of this change outside of business software.
[22:28:47] <dminkovsky> Playstation was a thing in 1996?
[22:28:47] <manicennui> The web in general was, and MS did a good job of holding the web hostage for 5 years or so.
[22:28:57] <dminkovsky> longer, really
[22:29:18] <dminkovsky> well
[22:29:23] <dminkovsky> 1997 -
[22:29:25] <dminkovsky> i don't know
[22:30:33] <manicennui> I like how he directly encourages "embrace and extend" and even calls it that.
[22:30:54] <dminkovsky> his reply is way too long
[22:31:09] <manicennui> He also claims that it is a "winner take all world".
[22:31:10] <manicennui> Insane.
[22:31:15] <dminkovsky> yeah it's all pretty incredibly to see see laid out like that
[22:31:15] <dminkovsky> yep
[22:31:28] <manicennui> Nah, this is exactly the type of reply I'd expect from people at this level who are actually good at their jobs.
[22:31:47] <manicennui> Nathan is obviously very smart.
[22:31:52] <manicennui> Unfortunately he is an asshole.

[22:34:25] <imode> Ultra64 really dates those e-mails.
[22:34:53] <manicennui> Playstation was released in 95 in the US.
[22:38:06] <manicennui> I think Nathan's response is pretty insightful, setting aside his push for continuing their evil practices.
[22:44:46] <dminkovsky> eh it's kind of platitudinous
[22:44:54] <dminkovsky> their whole multimedia thing was a bust
[22:45:05] <dminkovsky> there's a lot of vacant stuff in there
[22:45:07] <manicennui> They are one of the dominant platforms for games today.
[22:45:20] <manicennui> And they are on equal footing with the Mac for media authoring.
[22:45:23] <manicennui> And SGI is dead.

[22:45:46] <dminkovsky> but they didn't get there with how they thought they would
[22:45:50] <dminkovsky> at least i don't tihnk so
[22:45:55] <dminkovsky> "virtual worlds"
[22:46:02] <dminkovsky> (to quote his reply)
[22:46:09] <manicennui> I think you are being a bit ridiculous.
[22:46:18] <dminkovsky> why is that
[22:46:38] <manicennui> That he doesn't spell out exactly how everything is going to happen and he didn't predict everything perfectly doesn't make what he wrote "vacant".
[22:47:03] <manicennui> This isn't his thesis for the next decade of MS.
[22:48:49] <manicennui> It's not as though this is the end of the discussion.
[22:51:35] <manicennui> DirectX was new at that time, and people were just starting to play some games in Windows itself instead of in DOS.
[23:03:35] <dminkovsky> i don't know
[23:03:45] <dminkovsky> i'm too lazy to type sentences out of that reply
[23:03:47] <dminkovsky> one sec
[23:04:15] <dminkovsky> but i will tell you that even in 1996 a lot of microsoft's "multimedia" this and that already then felt like marketing jargon
[23:04:18] <dminkovsky> that's why i'm calling it vacant
[23:04:32] <dminkovsky> it always, from a user perspective, felt really aspirational
[23:04:42] <dminkovsky> at best
[23:04:53] <dminkovsky> the Buddy Holly video was hidden on the Windows 95 CD!
[23:04:58] <dminkovsky> for goodness sake
[23:05:18] <dminkovsky> his bit about "abstracting storage"
[23:05:29] <dminkovsky> i dunnnno
[23:05:44] <manicennui> dminkovsky: He mentioned it as a possible area for focus.
[23:05:58] <manicennui> He wasn't claiming that they were already winning in that area.
[23:06:06] <dminkovsky> sure but it's just he's throwing out all these catchy things
[23:06:09] <manicennui> Did you actually read his response or just skim it?
[23:06:13] <dminkovsky> almost like he's trying to distract bill from his anxeities
[23:06:18] <dminkovsky> i read it!
[23:06:25] <dminkovsky> well, properly like 80% of it at least
[23:06:51] <manicennui> He responded to an email he received after work hours the night before at noon with some good starting points for discussion.
[23:06:55] <manicennui> I'm not sure what you expect this email to be.
[23:07:15] <dminkovsky> less overwhelming and more concise
[23:07:27] <dminkovsky> "java sucks bill, have you tried it?"
[23:07:33] <manicennui> I'm sorry, but this is how smart people discuss things.
[23:07:34] <dminkovsky> done
[23:07:41] <dminkovsky> well read bill's email
[23:07:50] <manicennui> A singular email.
[23:07:52] <dminkovsky> smart people write concise emails
[23:08:05] <manicennui> Nonsense.
[23:08:50] <dminkovsky> little of that stuff seems actually relevant to the java question
[23:08:58] <dminkovsky> bill was concerned that java will make the OS less relevant
[23:09:00] <manicennui> Of course it is.
[23:09:12] <dminkovsky> i'm not sure how much this response is well-focused on that issue
[23:09:14] <manicennui> I don't understand how you can't understand how it is relevant.
[23:10:38] <dminkovsky> it's relevant for two screenshots
[23:10:45] <manicennui> I feel like you want pithy emails like someone wrote them for a movie.
[23:10:45] <dminkovsky> the second two really trail off
[23:11:01] <manicennui> Where Nathan lays out the perfect plan to foil Sun.
[23:11:04] <manicennui> It's a huge issue.
[23:11:11] <dminkovsky> well i did like the ones between elizabeth holmes and ruper murdock
[23:11:25] <manicennui> I'd be willing to bet money that this email chain is huge and both sides write many more long emails.
[23:11:34] <dminkovsky> nonsense
[23:11:36] <manicennui> And there were dozens or hundreds of in person conversations about it too.
[23:11:54] <dminkovsky> i want him to say "Bill, Java is 10 years away, and have you actually tried to run an applet, it sucks."
[23:12:23] <dminkovsky> manicennui: probably
[23:12:27] <dminkovsky> i don't know
[23:12:40] <manicennui> How is that response useful?
[23:12:51] <dminkovsky> i mean, not that it's part of a long chain, sure
[23:13:08] <manicennui> That sounds like how you respond to an idiot who you can brush off with unthoughtful responses.
[23:13:09] <dminkovsky> because bill is writing about how he can't sleep and is stressing about Java
[23:13:17] <dminkovsky> there's nothing to say about Java, in many ways Java never happened
[23:13:25] <dminkovsky> half of it turned out to be vaporware
[23:13:29] <dminkovsky> in a sense
[23:13:38] <dminkovsky> the half that was stressing bill!
[23:13:49] <dminkovsky> there was no threat there at all
[23:14:06] <manicennui> The overall insight that they would be threatened by cross-platform software on the web is spot on.
[23:14:10] <dminkovsky> it was evident to 7th grade me, who got tired of waiting for the applet to load
[23:14:17] <manicennui> The fact that Java wasn't the technology that was central to that is kind of irrelevant.
[23:14:38] <manicennui> Java did eat a lot of their backend server market though.
[23:14:38] <dminkovsky> well of course
[23:14:46] <manicennui> By allowing companies to use other platforms for that.
[23:14:47] <dminkovsky> right
[23:15:06] <dminkovsky> but that's not what bill is stressing about. he's stressing about "they would be threatened by cross-platform software on the web is spot on."
[23:15:34] <dminkovsky> anyway, if it's part of a large conversation they're having 24/7 anyway then yeah
[23:15:44] <manicennui> And Nathan had some good initial thoughts on that.
[23:15:48] <dminkovsky> they're having this protracted company stragegy thing going all the time
[23:16:01] <manicennui> Including not focusing on the specific way that Bill thinks Java is threatening them.
[23:16:14] <manicennui> And working to maintain their platform outside of the web.
[23:17:18] <dminkovsky> yeah makes sense i guess
[23:26:39] <dminkovsky> i think i'll refine by statement by saying that in reality microsoft didn't do much for the end-user
[23:27:03] <dminkovsky> his reply ends with value for the end-user, but this whole scheming was really just not about that at all
[23:27:37] <dminkovsky> i have a pretty solid disdain for windows because i view it as having held me back with computers
[23:27:45] <dminkovsky> i got pretty good at clicking through all its little forms and shit
[23:27:54] <dminkovsky> but that didn't do much for me as a person
[23:28:05] <manicennui> I hate Windows too, but what he says makes sense for them.
[23:28:15] <dminkovsky> but they didn't even do much of it
[23:28:19] <manicennui> And they were actively working on these things and did succeed with many of them.
[23:28:38] <manicennui> They did though.
[23:28:38] <dminkovsky> the email can end of their anti-competitive stuff because that was their acutal focus
[23:28:42] <dminkovsky> product was never their focus
[23:28:55] <dminkovsky> they shipped crap
[23:29:06] <dminkovsky> like, updatesl iterally never worked
[23:29:22] <dminkovsky> people took it for granted that updating windows was not actually somthing you could do
[23:29:25] <manicennui> They started directx with Windows 95 and it became more and more popular.
[23:29:34] <dminkovsky> when i first updated OS X and it... worked... i was pretty stunned
[23:29:37] <manicennui> Windows is now the second most popular platform behind mobile.
[23:29:42] <dminkovsky> yes i'm not saying they didn't produce advanced computer technology
[23:29:52] <dminkovsky> they certainly did do that
[23:29:54] <manicennui> Nothing to do with it being "advanced".
[23:30:02] <manicennui> They executed on many of these things well.
[23:30:10] <dminkovsky> sure
[23:30:12] <manicennui> Regardless of whether we liked them.
[23:30:27] <dminkovsky> but they released updates knowing full well they wouldn't be possible
[23:30:32] <dminkovsky> i mean, you could update clean windows
[23:30:33] *** Joins: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost)
[23:30:41] <dminkovsky> but trying to update non-clean windows was naive
[23:30:48] <dminkovsky> in that sense, they regularly shipped vaporware
[23:30:58] <dminkovsky> everyone knew it, they knew it, we knew it
[23:31:18] <dminkovsky> there's something weird about that
[23:31:31] <dminkovsky> and what enabled that was their anti-competitive practices
[23:32:09] <dminkovsky> Nathan is going on about these big-topic issues for them
[23:32:21] <dminkovsky> but all of that--not all of it, but a lot of it--was vapor
[23:32:32] <dminkovsky> and the focus is up front in the beginning, being anti-comeptitive
[23:32:53] <dminkovsky> ending on user value note it's like he knows he's writing for posterity
[23:33:54] <manicennui> Other than the problems he specifically calls out as "hard", the only real vaporware is the virtual worlds thing.
[23:33:58] <dminkovsky> user value would have been letting dell ship linux :)
[23:34:06] <manicennui> And he specifically said that his list was limited and he could put more thought into it.
[23:34:24] <manicennui> Windows was also not popular for audio/video production at that point, and they are now.
[23:34:42] <dminkovsky> well it's been almost 30 years
[23:34:47] <dminkovsky> a lot has happened
[23:35:22] <dminkovsky> anyway, whatever
[23:35:32] <dminkovsky> i think we agree fascinating email
[23:35:56] <manicennui> That was also in 96. Windows 95 had just been released the year before, and most people were still using DOS and other shit, if they had a computer at all.
[23:37:30] <dminkovsky> yeah it's fun to think about them writing these emails at their workstations
[23:37:37] <dminkovsky> or laptop computers
[23:37:39] <manicennui> Photoshop wasn't even ported to Windows until 93.
[23:37:53] <manicennui> It was Mac only before that.
[23:38:16] <dminkovsky> windows 95 was huge
[23:38:30] <dminkovsky> but a lot of it was vapor
[23:38:34] <dminkovsky> i just keep going back to that in my mind, sorry
[23:38:38] <dminkovsky> like those microphones
[23:38:48] <dminkovsky> and all that fake software
[23:39:06] <manicennui> I'm not sure what you mean.
[23:39:26] <dminkovsky> like those 1000 applications packages that would come with packard bells
[23:39:46] <dminkovsky> obviously they were "Real" software but
[23:40:03] <dminkovsky> it never really felt like much of anything
[23:40:26] <dminkovsky> those beige mircophones for sure were pretty not real though :)
[23:42:13] <dminkovsky> i never got one that worked well

[23:42:45] <buttsbot> Old school PC microphones : nostalgia
[23:43:29] <manicennui> I had one of those.
[23:43:36] <manicennui> What was not real about them?

[23:43:48] <buttsbot> OkraGarden comments on Old school PC microphones
[23:44:02] <dminkovsky> they sucked
[23:44:11] <manicennui> Sure, but they were real.
[23:44:17] <manicennui> They were also really cheap.
[23:44:20] <manicennui> Not sure what you expected.
[23:44:32] <dminkovsky> well yes, so i'm using the word real not literally :)
[23:44:39] <manicennui> There were also very limited use cases for them at that point.
[23:44:44] <dminkovsky> that if something is really made, it works more than not at all
[23:44:58] <dminkovsky> right, and the use-cases were fake too
[23:45:08] <mgdm> Xe: if I were to do a post heavily inspired by your JSON/sqlite one, but for pgsql, would you object? I spent quite a lot of time last year doing similar things there
[23:45:08] <manicennui> I never had problems with them working, but I don't remember what I actually used them for.
[23:45:09] <dminkovsky> such as, dragon naturally speaking, which also did not work
[23:45:24] <manicennui> Dragon eventually worked pretty well.
[23:45:48] <dminkovsky> not in the 90s or early 2000s
[23:48:57] <manicennui> The company I worked for starting in 2002 sold Dragon as a solution to doctors for transcription.
[23:49:08] <manicennui> I think we recommended a good headset.
[23:49:33] <manicennui> It wasn't perfect, but having to go back and correct a small number of words was way cheaper than transcription services.
[23:50:08] <manicennui> It's one of those things that needs many years of testing in production to get good.
[23:50:12] <manicennui> And hardware improvements.
[23:54:45] <dminkovsky> packaged with those mics and soundcards it was little more than vapor
[23:56:00] <manicennui> You know, I probably got one of those mics with my SoundBlaster
