[00:02:10] <audrey> I´ve lost a few friends over the years because we didn´t agree on this or that topic. I´ve always thought it was sad that those disagreements were seen as reasons to terminate acquaintance.
[00:02:32] <biys> do you think you pressured the person too hard?  i know i have
[00:02:50] <biys> i know i've caused people to walk away because they refused to rationalize their position

[00:03:12] <audrey> Pressured? I rarely try to convince other people of my views. If asked, I´ll voice my views, but I don´t like proselytizing, and in my experience it´s extraordinarily difficult to change people´s preexisting beliefs on philosophical, cultural, and economic topics.
[00:03:12] <biys> but i don't really feel heart broken about it
[00:03:29] <biys> i mean... if the person isn't really able to elaborate on their position, it's likely they're just NPC anyways

[00:10:20] <audrey> I am reminded of the intellectuals at the end of the 19th century who confidently and loudly asserted that human flight is obviously impossible because nothing heavier than air can stay in the air - while of course, birds and dragonflies flew past their windows.
[00:10:54] <audrey> Yes, pretty much, but hubris goes a bit deeper in my book - it combines arrogance with a kind of unwarranted self-certainty, a kind of false pride.
[00:12:13] <audrey> JBP occasionally ventures into this sort of hubris, but not as frequently, so I´m willing to put up with him even if I think he has some bad takes.

[01:24:42] <causative> the great hope of moral philosophy is in the fact that humans hold irrational and inconsistent preferences; there are things X, Y, Z where a person may prefer X to Y, and Y to Z, and Z to X.
[01:25:24] <audrey> That´s only inconsistent if you assume that ethics are necessarily monotonic.
[01:25:37] <causative> from this it follows, with great ceremony, that what you currently prefer, is not the same as what you would prefer if you were more rational!
[01:25:38] <audrey> Which is not by any means a foregone conclusion.

[01:26:28] <audrey> It might very well be that closed-world, deductive models of this sort might legitimately break down when faced with the thorniness of ethical preferences/decisionmaking.
[01:26:34] <causative> moral philosophy, from one perspective, concerns itself with the preferences that a rational being should have - a being that has resolved these inconsistent preferences
[01:27:08] <causative> and the preferences of such a being would be different from your current ones
[01:27:23] <audrey> This was one of the major themes of the class in bioethics I took my last year of undergrad. There was a really compelling piece in particular. I think I might still have the syllabus lying around somewhere...
[01:27:24] <causative> which we may say - we may *define* - using the phrase, "you should want things other than what you currently want."
[01:27:36] <causative> that's where we get ought from is
[01:27:51] <causative> that's how ought is defined

[01:37:53] <causative> now, one might raise an objection, that what one "rationally" would prefer might still be very selfish and immoral
[01:38:22] <causative> I'm not so sure about that, but that's the objection; and the objection would go on to say, that if what "rationally" prefers is selfish and immoral, how can we say it is what one "ought" to prefer?
[01:38:30] <causative> *if what one
[01:39:48] <causative> I answer the objection this way:  imagine for a second some alternative notion of "ought."  Suppose that we use reason to derive that people ought to do X.  Further suppose that this notion of "ought" does *not* rationally *persuade* anyone to do X, not even the philosopher who invented it.
[01:40:39] <causative> In this case it seems difficult to reconcile this notion of "ought" with one's intuitions about it, and so I would say it is an invalid notion of "ought."

[01:41:32] <causative> A formally derived "ought" that fails to persuade, is no ought at all.  If you accept this, you have eliminated all non-persuasive notions of ought.
[01:42:11] <causative> and we are left with the idea, already presented, that what one ought to do, is at least something that reason *could potentially* persuade you to do.

[01:50:56] <causative> anyone who can understand
[01:51:24] <causative> now, the objection may still have merit, because if rational persuasion only leads one to selfish and cruel deeds, then indeed the label of "ought" would be ill-applied

[01:52:24] <causative> but the point of the preceding is that if there is *anything* we might label with "ought," it must at least be persuasive to a reasonable person; if it is not persuasive it is not a legitimate "ought."
[01:52:51] <causative> persuasiveness is a prerequisite for something fulfilling our natural idea of "ought," though perhaps not sufficient by itself

[02:18:16] <Ungwelian> I honestly feel that feelings are nowadays criticised too much, as opposed to logic and rationales. Which is probably the result of the education institutions.
[02:18:28] <Ungwelian> They emphasise the latter.
[02:18:36] <trbp> Ungwelian: well feelings are not bad
[02:18:43] <trbp> but take fear for example
[02:18:44] <zicada> trbp: group/individual lense, and object/subject are very related

[02:20:15] <zicada> anything else is wishful thinking
[02:20:21] <trbp> bullshit
[02:20:27] <Ungwelian> Feelings are what make people act. In both good and bad. And plenty of them come from experiences.
[02:20:28] <zicada> hehe
[02:20:54] <Ungwelian> Sometimes a given feeling is a very understandable and justifiable response to what has happened.
[02:20:57] <zicada> only feelings and opinions and individual views are subjective
[02:21:04] <zicada> 2+2 is 4, objectively
[02:21:14] <zicada> ethics, politics
[02:21:17] <zicada> subjective
[02:21:19] <Ungwelian> The trouble, I guess, comes when feelings are projected into the future too broadly and without care.
[02:21:35] <zicada> trbp: if it depends who you ask, its subjective
[02:21:49] <zicada> trbp: if it doesnt depend who you ask, its objective
[02:22:22] <zicada> i bet somebody came up with a name and law for it, if not im claiming it
[02:22:36] <trbp> if you have the question you always have someone

[02:24:10] <zicada> this should be pretty straight fwd
[02:24:32] <trbp> ok take the maybe and make it to an is
[02:24:38] <zicada> if it were this easy, somebody might have done it by now trbp
[02:24:40] <trbp> is it pure objective now?

[02:25:04] <zicada> "it" is pure objective
[02:25:06] <trbp> zicada: what makes you sure that it was not done?
[02:25:11] <trbp> and is always done?
[02:25:29] <zicada> to say that something provably is, is objective, like 2+2=4
[02:25:37] <zicada> or the north pole is north
[02:25:53] <trbp> last ist just definition
[02:26:16] <trbp> and the first is well following suit some little logical axioms
[02:26:34] <trbp> both can be understood objective or subjective
[02:26:39] <zicada> facts are objective, facts are agreed upon by all who know them
[02:26:58] <zicada> people who dont know them simply need to be informed, and they too will know those facts
[02:27:11] <trbp> zicada: by all who know them
[02:27:14] <zicada> its not possible to be in a minority that thinks 2+2 is NOT 4
[02:27:20] <trbp> so you need the subject to define your object
[02:27:22] <trbp> nice
[02:27:37] <zicada> subject and object and their differences interests me
[02:28:19] <trbp> and it is not possible to be not interested in math and that any 2+2 is four well hmmmm
[02:28:28] <zicada> how and what about human life is due to personality vs genes, to culture vs innate ability, and so on
[02:28:37] <trbp> i know a lot of people who do not know 2+2
[02:29:27] <zicada> trbp: if you had to relate how much genes matter vs social cultural input (eg nurture) affects an individual, would you say 50/50 ? 40/60 ?
[02:29:28] <trbp> and the root to all is subject and object?
[02:29:45] <zicada> on average obviously
[02:30:03] <trbp> again it depends on your point of view
[02:30:20] <zicada> should it ?
[02:30:30] <trbp> without the 100% genes there would be no you or me to debate about
[02:30:41] <zicada> should it matter much much of reality you attribute to ought vs is in what's actually .. "REAL" ?
[02:30:48] <trbp> though not a 100% of our genes are used at the moment to discuss it
[02:30:48] <zicada> is culture "REAL" ?
[02:30:56] <zicada> does culture exist ?
[02:31:06] <trbp> but if they would be not there the 100%.....
[02:31:23] <zicada> what does it even mean for things like culture to exist, amirite
[02:32:11] <trbp> well again without our socio-cultural influcenses each and everyone of us had
[02:32:19] <trbp> we would be not here like that what we are
[02:32:25] <zicada> trbp: i meant, are the way people end up 50/50 genes and their parents and friends and life-experiences ? Or is it like 80% genes 20% friends, or the opposite ?
[02:32:27] <trbp> to 100% or less
[02:32:43] <trbp> it is always just a question from which angle you look at it
[02:33:25] <zicada> trbp: many western nations have adopted very young children from developing countries, who have grown up in the dominant western culture of the host country
[02:33:37] <trbp> and?
[02:33:46] <zicada> trbp: in that case, it seems culture has a lot of impact, and genetics not so much
[02:34:41] <zicada> trbp: what we experience in our first 3-5 years really informs what kind of person we are going to be become. DO you agree ?
[02:35:00] <trbp> is that working also with marathon sports
[02:35:04] <trbp> basketball?
[02:35:36] <trbp> wait was not basketball seggragated before the colored overtook?
[02:35:36] <zicada> trbp: why would it ?
[02:35:55] <trbp> well i do not know you tell me
[02:36:06] <trbp> you want a 50 50 80 20
[02:36:16] <trbp> i can live quite well with a 100 0 or 0 100
[02:36:20] <zicada> trbp: youre thinking sports are objective, and so they're an argument against right
[02:36:28] <trbp> or any scales inbetween
[02:36:38] <zicada> are they though trbp ? are sports objective ?
[02:36:40] <trbp> no i am not thinking
[02:36:48] <trbp> i am suggesting
[02:36:48] <zicada> i agree
[02:37:00] <zicada> sports is subjective
[02:37:23] <trbp> yes it is 100%
[02:37:26] <zicada> but we use objective unchangable markers
[02:37:33] <zicada> to determine winners over losers
[02:37:47] <trbp> a collective audiance that believes that someone ran the next worldrecord
[02:37:51] <trbp> quite subjective
[02:38:17] <zicada> they are sharing in something, and all of that is subjective
[02:38:44] <zicada> but also very universal i think, i think we all ought to just come together as humans
[02:38:47] <zicada> litterally

[02:52:25] <audrey> biys: Or Euclidean vs. non-Euclidean geometry
[02:52:29] <yanmaani> which must be some kind of informal fallacy, surely
[02:52:47] <yanmaani> you talk to someone about some proposition
[02:52:55] <yanmaani> they say oh that's not true, or oh that's trivially true
[02:53:09] <yanmaani> you ask them to elaborate
[02:53:18] <yanmaani> they say there's very good evidence, but they're not going to tell you
[02:53:29] <zicada> biys: i dont think thats simple at all
[02:53:36] <yanmaani> It sounds stupid when I put it like that, but you all know what I mean, yeah?

[02:54:47] <yanmaani> Surely, "2+2," understood within the conventional meaning that words have in the English language has a quite well-defined meaning

[02:56:09] <yanmaani> e.g. taking 2 to mean S(S(0)), + to mean whatever it means within Peano arithmetic, etc
[02:56:33] <zicada> thats not it though, its human intuition

[02:57:30] <yanmaani> I think maybe the useful critique here is that 2+2 = 4 is *logically true*, which is thus tautological and not useful, and trivially not true for facts about the real world
[02:57:56] <yanmaani> i've heard this argument before and it's as silly every time, quite frankly

[03:04:37] <zicada> im talking saying objective is the same as fact is the same as 2+2=4 is the same as things people either know, or don't. VS subjective things, opinions, views, things individuals have where nobody really has a perfect answer, it depends
[03:07:45] <zicada> unless you have any good arguments to the contrary, i content that its fine to say that subjective = opinion = individual, and that fact = global truth. Obviously religions using the word "true" to point out their faith problematizes this picture

[03:41:57] <Ungwelian> But 2+2=4 isn't objective :)
[03:42:18] <Ungwelian> On high values of 2: 2+2 = 5.
[03:42:27] <Ungwelian> On low values of 2: 2+2 = 3.
[03:43:20] <bittersweetsymph> It is quite possible that we are descending into an age in which two plus two will make five when the Leader says so.
[03:43:24] <Ungwelian> And that doesn't even touch the demarcation problem.
[03:43:42] <Ungwelian> It could well be that 2 is wrongly demarcated to begin with.
[03:43:57] <bittersweetsymph> In the end, the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking
[03:43:58] <bittersweetsymph> otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable—what then?
[03:44:00] <Ungwelian> Lie, bigger lie, statistic.
[03:44:31] <bittersweetsymph> well if you were rounding Ungwelian
[03:44:46] <bittersweetsymph> that is one way to agree with them and not say something you think is false

[03:45:32] <Ungwelian> I loved that book.
[03:45:56] <zicada> you need that, anyone can pretend to mean one thing while meaning another etc, but thats not good faith, thats purposefully lying
[03:46:28] <Ungwelian> That's the thing, zicada. Even math is subject to interpretation.
[03:46:41] <zicada> Ungwelian: give an argument as to how then
[03:46:53] <Ungwelian> 2+2 = 3-5.
[03:46:55] <zicada> Ungwelian: its not as though its not been discussed before..
[03:47:10] <zicada> no it isnt
[03:47:35] <zicada> hehe at least try :>
[03:47:47] <zicada> 4 = -2 ?
[03:48:13] <Ungwelian> Here we have another interpretation :D
[03:48:31] <Ungwelian> Was it a minus or a hyphen?

[03:52:27] <Ungwelian> *if a given instance
[03:53:47] <bittersweetsymph> In propaganda work for the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) during the Second World War (1939–1945), George Orwell applied the illogic of 2 + 2 = 5 to counter the reality-denying psychology of Nazi propaganda, which he addressed in the essay "Looking Back on the Spanish War" (1943), indicating that:
[03:53:48] <bittersweetsymph> Nazi theory, indeed, specifically denies that such a thing as "the truth" exists. There is, for instance, no such thing as "Science". There is only "German Science", "Jewish Science", etc. The implied objective of this line of thought is a nightmare world in which the Leader, or some ruling clique, controls not only the future, but the past. If the Leader says of such and such an event, "It never happened"—well, it never happened. I
[03:53:48] <bittersweetsymph> f he says that "two and two are five"—well, two and two are five. This prospect frightens me much more than bombs—and, after our experiences of the last few years [the Blitz, 1940–41] that is not a frivolous statement.
[03:54:27] <bittersweetsymph> Ungwelian, makes an argument that makes sense that 2+2=5 if it is a low 2 and a high 2, it's funny.
[03:54:45] <Ungwelian> :)
[03:54:59] <Ungwelian> I guess math wasn't Orwell's strongest subject.
[03:56:14] <Ungwelian> But more seriously, I think the abbreviated nature of math tends to make people believe it more readily than words.

[06:33:27] <arcturus> this realization can sometimes lead to wanton degeneracy
[06:33:28] <biys> scam is a pretty harsh word

[06:35:28] <giusb> Some phlosophers realize that they (perhaps anyone) can't grasp or prove absolute moral truth, and then for some reason think that there is no morality ever. Idk if we'll ever find very good arguments that "solve" ethics, but I'm not gonna push old ladies under buses because of it
[06:36:07] <Delf> That may be. But the ones I've encountered have merely been emotionally unstable

[06:40:11] <Delf> To question is a nice set of tool, but it cannot be used as a super power or it will become a sword that cuts both ways.
[06:40:35] <Delf> Are you saying that ignorance is bliss?
[06:40:43] <biys> to some extent, yes
[06:41:19] <Delf> Focus is bliss, not ignorance
[06:41:19] <arcturus> well, if not a scam, then a scheme at least
[06:41:30] <arcturus> or even a plot
[06:41:36] <biys> i wish, now days more than others, that i hadn't read or looked at anything i have.
[06:41:47] <biys> i remember back in my 20's not giving a fuck and being way happier than i am now
[06:41:53] <biys> then i started reading
[06:41:59] <biys> and now i'm just miserable for the most part
[06:42:07] <biys> but miserable in a happy way
[06:42:22] <Delf> So which one is it?
[06:42:51] <biys> happy in a way that oen day i know it all will end
[06:42:53] * biys swats flies
[06:42:57] <biys> jk jk
[06:43:00] <biys> i'm being dark
[06:43:18] <Delf> Don't console yourselves
[06:43:27] <biys> brb
[06:45:46] <Delf> arcturus: I think they behave like this because they fail to see their own value... and they fail to see the value of others even more so. But then they have other that are similar to themselves, emotionally unstable, in behaviour so they feel close to them as they can relate.
[06:51:29] <giusb> biys: I'm 22 and I'm reading a lot of philosophy and questioning more and more (and getting more depressed? less depressed? hard to say)
[06:51:40] <giusb> I kinda wish my 20s were filled with blissful ignorance but alas
[06:51:50] <giusb> Maybe one day I will achieve blissful wisdom (!)
[06:52:42] <giusb> This prospect probably ranges from unlikely to impossible - not sure wisdom exists, or that it can ever be blissful
[06:53:50] <giusb> idk if philosophy actively helps make me happy, but the more I do philosophy the more I am convinced I must keep going
[06:56:36] <Delf> You'll have to actively make you happy
[06:58:22] <Delf> We have behaviors that are more and less "default". The more we understand ourselves, the more we can be.. consequence of our knowledge and intention, rather than internal defaults and external influences.

[07:02:49] <giusb> Not all knowledge is understanding though
[07:04:03] <giusb> Meaning that knowing how to be happy could be completely unrelated to knowing what happiness is
[07:05:07] <giusb> In fact, there are some things where "knowing" (having propositional knowledge or understanding) more about how to do it makes it harder to do it
[07:05:39] <Delf> In which situation does it make it easier to do it with less understanding?
[07:06:28] <giusb> See Zuangzi. For a less philosophical example, an episode of Bob's Burgers comes to mind, where Bob starts thinking about how does he flip burgers, and all of a sudden he can't do it anymore. No amount of thinking about it can fix it. Only when he stops thinking is he finally able to flip burgers again
[07:06:36] <giusb> I have a suspicion that happiness might work the same way
[07:07:29] <Delf> That is when we get in the way of our subsystems

[09:15:59] <biys> is it?
[09:16:12] <biys> frmo my observations it seems easier the other way
[09:16:39] <Delf> Being an asshole is easier too.

[09:18:59] <biys> why would you want to make things harder for yourself?
[09:19:32] <Delf> I would not. It just happens to be that the fucking universe hates me. So things tend to get harder for me as a consequence.
[09:19:46] <biys> why does the universe hate you?
[09:19:46] <biys> hah
[09:19:54] <biys> i imagine the universe has no feelings towards you at all

[12:57:28] <arryana> he was nowhere near a match for mine, though.  she's 75 lbs, long haired, and fast as lightning
[12:57:57] <bittersweetsymph> My neighbor's dog is a Rottweiler I think, I am a bit scared of it but it is a friendly dog I think.
[12:58:06] <arryana> even if he could have caught her, which he couldn't, her fur would have gone a long way toward protecting her
[12:58:13] <arryana> most rotties are dolls.

[12:58:54] <arryana> i worked in a boarding kennel for a few years when i was young, out of the 800 or so dogs that went through that place, we disliked/feared exactly two of them.
[12:59:00] <arryana> and neither were rotts.
[12:59:49] <arryana> i would even go so far as to say that i'd rather get in a closed pen with any random rott, pit, or boxer than any random cocker spaniel
[13:00:19] <arryana> the person who left me the job opening lost two fingers to a cocker spaniel.
[13:00:49] <arryana> i've met nice ones, but those are the exception.
[13:01:15] <arryana> i've never personally met one that was both nice and not abysmally stupid
[13:01:50] <arryana> do you have a lot of trouble with drive issues, as both labs and border collies are easily bored

[13:02:55] <bittersweetsymph> The most aggressive dogs I have seen are sometimes Chihuahuas heh
[13:03:04] * arryana nods
[13:03:14] <bittersweetsymph> some of the bigger ones are more gentle giants
[13:03:34] <arryana> i used to think that little dogs were trying to compensate, but i've come to think it's more that little dogs are allowed to get away with behavior that would not be tolerated in a large dog.
[13:03:42] <bittersweetsymph> I am lucky as I have a yard and the dog park and beach walking distance

[13:04:15] <arryana> we very much picked this house with the dogs in mind.
[13:05:11] <bittersweetsymph> my dog does dig wholes sometimes though
[13:05:14] <bittersweetsymph> usually after I mow
[13:05:22] <arryana> the older i get, the more i need a pair, though.  they exercise each other by wrestling and chasing
[13:05:26] <bittersweetsymph> probably just finds it fun

[13:05:48] <arryana> mine are only allowed to dig in sand, but we do take them to the beach to do so at least a few times a year
[13:06:32] <arryana> i'll probably set them up a sunken kiddie pool full of sand here eventually
[13:07:23] <arryana> like so many things, it's on 'the list'
