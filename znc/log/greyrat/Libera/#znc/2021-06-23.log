[12:25:52] <SysGhost> I've been trying to get a znc network to use the sasl module. I've loaded the module, and configured it. But it isn't used at all when reconnecting / jump
[12:25:57] <SysGhost> what am I missing?
[12:27:03] <TheFatherMind> did you use the sasl argument to set the username and password?
[12:27:17] <SysGhost> yes
[12:27:25] <TheFatherMind> I got nothing beyond that.  (:
[12:27:35] <TheFatherMind> others will respond.
[12:27:42] <KindOne> What network?
[12:27:52] <SysGhost> Freenode... (Their new servers)
[12:28:12] <SysGhost> with libera (here) it works just fine. exactly the same procedure
[12:28:18] <KindOne> I assume you have re-registered your nick on freenode?
[12:28:22] <SysGhost> yep
[12:28:36] <SysGhost> when I direct-connect with my client, the creds works
[12:28:43] <DarthGandalf> Why would you want to say on freenode? :)
[12:28:53] <TheFatherMind> I have reasons.
[12:28:55] <TheFatherMind> good ones.
[12:28:59] <SysGhost> a few stubborn channels that haven't realised at all what's going on
[12:29:17] <DarthGandalf> using cert or pass?
[12:29:21] <SysGhost> plain pass
[12:29:26] <DarthGandalf> check list of mechanisms, is PLAIN enabled?
[12:29:33] <SysGhost> yep, and set 
[12:30:07] <SysGhost> I just activated verbosity. It gives me the error: PLAIN mechanism failed.
[12:30:16] <DarthGandalf> then either username or pass is incorrect
[12:30:18] <SysGhost> I don't see the reason to why
[12:30:31] <DarthGandalf> CaPiTal LeTtErS?
[12:30:41] <SysGhost> I took the exact same details as I have when connecting directly. Copy-pasted it to make sure it's correct
[12:30:51] <SysGhost> checking again...
[12:31:00] <DarthGandalf> in username too, not only pass
[12:31:06] <SysGhost> yep... should be right... but it still fails.

[12:47:00] <SysGhost> I have a few channels no longer used. I tried parting from them, but when reconnecting znc makes my client rejoin them again. I can disable the channel, but it still lingers in the channel list.
[12:54:02] <SysGhost> Ah. Again manually editing the config to remove unwanted channels was the solution. Wish there was a command to actually remove a channel
[12:54:36] <TheFatherMind> I thought you could do that from the web interface
[12:55:16] <SysGhost> oh? perhaps? ... I mainly use status and module commands to admin it.
[12:56:48] <SysGhost> I can't see anything related to channels in the web interface.
[12:57:11] <TheFatherMind> Click on the network first
[12:57:12] <SysGhost> my account settings, sasl stuff and some generic configuration. Quite limited
[12:57:38] <SysGhost> there's no network to click on
[12:57:43] <TheFatherMind> edit the network
[12:57:48] <TheFatherMind> reallY?
[12:58:08] <TheFatherMind> Someone else will have to help with that.   Best I can offer is a screenshot of mine.
[12:58:49] <SysGhost> https://i.imgur.com/NSDOtsO.png
[12:59:32] <TheFatherMind> Yeah I would click "manage users" on the right
[12:59:33] <SysGhost> it is very... spartan.
[12:59:35] <TheFatherMind> Then my username
[12:59:41] <TheFatherMind> Then the network
[13:00:02] <SysGhost> oh... that was... not too logical
[13:00:20] <TheFatherMind> It was to me.  (:  But I can see the confusion.
