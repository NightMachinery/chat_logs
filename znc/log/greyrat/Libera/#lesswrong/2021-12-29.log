[02:17:44] <Robomot> Want to Be an Actuary? Odds Are, You’ll Fail the Test - WSJ (Insurers need experts to calculate risk. Among those number-crunchers’ riskiest endeavors are the tortuous exams for credentials; ‘Calculate the number of blue balls in the second urn.’)
[02:18:42] <Gurkenglas> twice the number-crunchers in the second urn
[02:19:49] <PlanckWalk> That sample question looks easy enough
[02:20:15] <gwern> it's doubtless one of the easier questions from the first of the 10 or so exams
[02:20:26] <PlanckWalk> I would hope so
[02:20:37] <PlanckWalk> Well, not hope that there are 10 or so exams
[02:20:46] <PlanckWalk> But one of the easier questions
[02:24:17] <kuudes> I have sometimes considered if I should take an actuary or auditor or accountant credential exam
[02:24:55] <kuudes> those seem to have decent bang for the buck, as passing is immediately useful re jobs, and you don't need to pay for training or expend time for training in specified way
[02:25:10] <kuudes> so they seem to fit also to people on this channel, maybe gwern etc?
[02:25:34] <kuudes> "just take the extra hard math test which then qualifies you to high paying jobs"
[02:25:35] <gwern> it's always sounded like it'd take a huge amount of time and effort
[02:25:47] <kuudes> for most people, yes
[02:26:03] <kuudes> but for shape rotators, I don't know
[02:26:32] <gwern> I mean even in the article, you have a woman with a dual degree in math and finance for whom it takes a decade
[02:26:35] <PlanckWalk> I don't know about actuary credentials, but accountants and auditors require memorizign a lot of ad-hoc and constantly changing regulations.
[02:26:42] <kuudes> I mean, presumably way less effort than bachelor's degree, but certainly more monetary reward
[02:26:43] <gwern> you don't need a decade to get up to speed on data science and DL
[02:27:09] <gwern> and it'll probably pay even more, actuaries is an old and well-established field which is being invaded by data science / ML
[02:27:16] <kuudes> if it takes you a decade, then it indeed is not bang for buck
[02:27:20] <gwern> plus stuffy old insurers are unlikely to pay as well as big tech
[02:27:43] <kuudes> well, are you getting big bucks from big tech?
[02:29:05] <kuudes> I mean, the single-exam credentials re finance industry seem like a goodish answer to "if you are so smart, why are you not rich?"
[02:29:37] <PlanckWalk> I'm an adaptation executor, not a richness maximizer.
[02:30:00] <kuudes> I have understood they don't have similar thing as "pick top 100 candidates" but instead more of "you have to be this tall to ride"
[02:30:22] <kuudes> and either you have the required process iq or you don't
[02:30:35] <Ralith> imagine not getting big bucks from big tech
[02:30:42] <kuudes> so my prior is that the actual test questions could feel not-hard for many on this channel

[02:34:26] <pompolic> they use WORDS and LETTERS when they could just ROTATE THE TRIANGLES

[02:36:24] <pompolic> the opposite is often pretty easy though: given a visual representation, and awareness of notational conventions, i can just switch codes to equation
[02:37:11] <pompolic> moreover people seem to have a fetish for working it out on paper (nb.: this is distinct from working it out in explicit steps; emphasis on "on the paper")
[02:37:29] <pompolic> and in symbolic format
[02:38:01] <Gurkenglas> pompolic, have you looked into category theory, which likes to write equations as "this diagram commutes"?
[02:40:19] <pompolic> i would have, but i heard from a mathematician that it's a deathtrap for nerds
[02:40:22] <pompolic> seems true
[02:40:24] <Gurkenglas> (aka "whenever there's two sequences of functions from a set in the diagram to another set, they do the same thing")
[02:40:30] <Gurkenglas> it's a lifetrap!
[02:40:42] <Gurkenglas> i am so alive.
[02:40:58] <pompolic> i can kind of see it though -- explaining git as a monoid in the category of the whatever
[02:41:05] <pompolic> *because* you're working on a graph
[02:41:30] <pompolic> wait, i misread you
[02:41:44] <pompolic> hmm, no i didn't
[02:42:07] <pompolic> i definitely find mappings between things via "lol it looks the same" (not perfect accuracy in either direction ofc)
[02:42:37] <Gurkenglas> today i figured out that that big arbitrary definition in that paper on how to derive "entropy" from first principles is just an adjunction. i expect to write that up.
[02:42:39] <pompolic> but the git line was confused
[02:42:50] <pompolic> cool
[02:43:38] <Gurkenglas> this happens all the time in category theory. a monad is just a monoid in the endofunctors. a category is just a monad in the spans.
[02:44:58] <Gurkenglas> a preorder is just a monad in the relations. a closure operator (a topological space) is just a monad in a poset.
[02:45:23] <Gurkenglas> a function is just an adjunction in the spans.
[02:48:17] <Gurkenglas> a product is just a terminal span. when all the arrows are linear, that gets you the direct product of vector spaces. when they're continuous, it gets you the product topology.
[02:49:46] <pompolic> this just sounds like homestuck lore for mathematicians
[02:49:48] <pompolic> (i apologize)
[02:49:59] <pompolic> (but the shapes do look the same)
[02:50:22] <Gurkenglas> then homestuck has good taste
[02:51:51] <pompolic> fwiw, i want to learn Haskell at some point anyway
[02:51:55] <pompolic> which seems highly relevant
[02:52:01] <Gurkenglas> i like to compare it to unsong. nothing is a coincidence.
[02:53:06] <pompolic> i think that's the appeal of homestuck too
[02:54:21] <pompolic> the other day someone was telling me he can't really think of good religious fiction
[02:54:58] <pompolic> i half-seriously recommended unsong (on the grounds that i trust Scott's writing abilities; have not gotten around to reading it yet)
[02:55:11] <pompolic> he actually said he will check it out
[02:58:23] <mjr> It is _excellent_. Actually I've recently said it's the best book period. Which I kinda still stand behind.
[02:58:57] <mjr> And it kinda does work as religious fiction because it _does_ deliver a reasonable solution to theodicy...
[03:00:32] <mjr> (There's a bit of a snag in the latter but saying more would be spoilers.)
[03:04:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> The best book? Come on :\
[03:05:08] <pompolic> genre: computational theodicy
[03:05:19] <pompolic> this is what i derived from descriptions of unsong so far
[03:06:04] <pompolic> which should be enjoyable, if not novel
[03:07:08] <mjr> Well HPMOR has some pacing issues.
[03:07:37] <mjr> And the Erogamer plotline is (for understandable reasons) a bit messy.
[03:08:03] <mjr> Hence Unsong.
[03:12:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh.
[03:12:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> There are other... books. Like... in existence.
[03:13:43] <Ralith> what! why did nobody mention this
[03:16:14] <PlanckWalk> It was an interesting solution in general to the problem of theodicy, but I found its actual use in the story to be utterly unconvincing.
[03:16:38] <PlanckWalk> Mainly because of Hell
[03:18:46] <PlanckWalk> My personal interpretation of "nothing is ever a coincidence" in that story is that the universe in question is still one of the low-entropy ones.
[03:19:08] <mjr> Obormot\Arcturus, well true but ShayneT gets a bit repetitive.
[03:20:02] <mjr> (Yes I'm being disingenuous.)
[03:20:22] <PlanckWalk> In almost all of the universes, nearly everything is a coincidence.
[03:21:11] <PlanckWalk> Err that is, nearly everything that looks like just a coincidence, actually is.
[03:21:12] <mjr> PlanckWalk, the "nothing is ever a coincidence" bit is mostly anthropic in that the world wouldn't exist were it not for the as such quite unlikely coincidences.
[03:21:42] <mjr> But since it does, there they are.
[03:22:26] <PlanckWalk> Eh, that doesn't really fit with the final premise though
[03:23:35] <mjr> (Well, "unlikely" in the sense that the people within the deterministic simulation would consider them unlikely given the laws of nature and probability as are known to them)
[03:23:38] <PlanckWalk> Every universe that is at least slightly more good than evil exists.
[03:24:00] <mjr> Considering that the universe there is pretty much deterministic so nothing that happens there is unlikely.
[03:24:18] <gwern> it's anthropic in the sense that the world has to net out to good, so the more extreme the evil, the more coincidences must be manufactured to thread the needle of eventual victory
[03:25:01] <gwern> if you observe yourself in an Unsong world where Satan himself walks the planet, the path to victory is pretty bad. in an Unsong world where nothing like Satan shows up, then the necessary coincidences won't be remarkable at all
[03:25:29] <gwern> in the worlds which are just Job sitting on a throne singing the praises of the Lord, the coincidences aren't interesting at all
[03:25:41] <mjr> Yeah.
[03:25:52] <gwern> but to generate a unique world, one must progressively introduce ever more extreme evils, and hence extreme countermeasures
[03:26:10] <PlanckWalk> I think that there are probably vastly more universes that are banal than those that have extreme evil or extreem good
[03:26:18] <gwern> _Unsong_ itself is presumably set in just about the worst possible universe
[03:26:36] <gwern> out at the very edge of net-goodness, things get *weird*
[03:26:41] <PlanckWalk> So yeah, the Unsong universe itself is one of the very very few extreme ones
[03:28:55] <Gurkenglas> nobody said it's few extreme ones.
[03:29:20] <PlanckWalk> I inferred that from the events
[03:29:27] <PlanckWalk> And the premise
[03:30:37] <Gurkenglas> in 2^100000 universes with 100000 dimensions along which one might be good, there are many, many more universes with 90000 good bits than ones with 95000 good bits.
[03:31:07] <Gurkenglas> Note how there is only one perfect universe, and then there's one almost-perfect universe for each letter to place at the center of all creation.
[03:31:43] <Gurkenglas> high-dimensional spheres are mostly crust.
[03:32:45] <Robomot> [Astral Codex Ten] ACX Grants Results - https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/acx-grants-results
[03:33:16] <PlanckWalk> That still implies boundedness
[03:33:21] <PlanckWalk> I don't have a bounded model
[03:33:59] <Gurkenglas> i don't see how my argument stops working when you're working with infinities and densities instead of numbers.
[03:34:39] <PlanckWalk> We know there is an upper bound to goodness
[03:34:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... wow
[03:35:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> These ACX grants actually make me angry
[03:35:48] <PlanckWalk> If you have an unbounded number of "goodness" numbers that sum to that upper bound, and a unbounded number of "evilness" numbers that sum to slightly less than any sum of "goodness" numbers, then the vast, vast majority of spaces have almost all of those numbers being near zero.
[03:36:02] <nshepperd2> 'Still other times, my grant reviewers tied themselves up in knots with 4D chess logic like "if they're smart enough to attempt this project, they're smart enough to know about XYZ Grants which is better suited for them, which means they're mostly banking on XYZ funding and using you as a backup, but if XYZ doesn't fund these people then that's
[03:36:02] <nshepperd2> strong evidence that they shouldn't be funded, so even though everything about them looks amazing, please reject them."' lol
[03:36:11] <PlanckWalk> So the "best possible universe" is just the single number 1.
[03:36:29] <pompolic> Obormot\Arcturus: any one in particular? all of them?
[03:36:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Mostly shit like this:
[03:36:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> "NA, $90,000, to buy a year of his time. NA is an experienced Australian political operative "on a first name basis with multiple federal politicians". You might remember some of his comments and stories from the ACX comment section, where he goes by AshLael. He's interested in using his expertise to promote effective altruism, either by lobbying directly or by training EAs in how to produce political change. I have no idea
[03:36:48] <Obormot\Arcturus>  what to do with him right now but I am going to figure it out and then do it. If you're in EA and have a good idea how to use this opportunity, please let me know."
[03:37:01] <Gurkenglas> PlanckWalk, Adam Kadmon is a finite description in god's language, which does use words and letters.
[03:37:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Disclosure: I applied for a grant, and didn't get one, obviously)
[03:37:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> (That's at least half of why I'm angry)
[03:37:33] <PlanckWalk> Words and letters are irrelevant to this
[03:37:50] <nshepperd2> $90k to simp for some random australian lobbyist without any actual plan?
[03:37:54] <PlanckWalk> In the sense that there is no upper bound to the length of descriptions.
[03:38:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> When I read stuff like "giving this science genius dude money to develop a plausible 'cure millions of people of a horrible wasting disease' treatment", I'm like, yeah, fair enough, that's more important than making some cool websites or w/e, godspeed
[03:38:37] <pompolic> i decided against applying for incidental reasons, and i'm thinking i should have
[03:38:47] <Gurkenglas> there's a simplicity prior over universes. if there weren't it'd be anthropically infinitely unlikely that the story would be set in a universe of description that isn't even a googleplex long.
[03:39:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> But when it's like "$90k to some guy who's like 'oh yeah I know lots of important people lol', for uh unspecified uses, idk lol"
[03:39:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> That makes my blood boil
[03:39:06] <PlanckWalk> Gurkenglas: That's why I said "very very few extreme universes"
[03:39:33] <pompolic> yeah nice catch actually
[03:39:38] <pompolic> i was just reading the NA paragraph
[03:39:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or this kinda shit:
[03:39:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Alice Evans, $60,000, for sabbatical and travel to fund her research and associated book on "the Great Gender Divergence", ie why some countries developed gender equality norms while others didn't. A large body of research shows that gender equality, aside from its moral benefits, is also deeply important for economic development. Dr. Evans is an expert on the interaction of gender, history, and economics, whose work has been
[03:39:57] <Obormot\Arcturus>  cited on BBC, Al Jazeera, and Sky News. She blogs here and podcasts here."
[03:40:00] <pompolic> and i was thinking "huh, anon, and what scott bought was his time, must be competent"
[03:40:12] <pompolic> that's what made me think i should have applied
[03:40:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or even this:
[03:40:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> "D, $5,000, to help interview for CS professor positions. D is a PhD student at a top university, with interests in EA and x-risk. He's ready to go on the professorship interview circuit, and thinks he could do a better job if he had some money to help with travel expenses and lost income beyond what schools already cover. If he gets it, he thinks there's a decent chance he could end up teaching CS at a top college. Everyone
[03:40:13] <Obormot\Arcturus>  with experience in movement-building says that getting your members into top positions at top colleges is important, and this is a surprisingly cheap opportunity to make that happen."
[03:40:21] <Gurkenglas> universes don't need to be complicated to be extreme, unless you count them as getting proportionally worse as the adam kadmon specifies larger and larger hells
[03:40:34] <pompolic> that's == the gender one
[03:40:38] <PlanckWalk> I see the simpler universes as being more extreme
[03:40:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or this:
[03:40:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "D, $10,000, to support him taking some time between his masters and PhD to re-orient, learn some new skills, and maybe end up choosing a better topic to do his thesis on. D studies the evolution of aging, and is interested in things like why seemingly-similar species of rockfish have lifespans ranging "from a decade to a couple centuries". He thinks this extra time would help direct him into higher-value areas of his
[03:40:40] <Obormot\Arcturus>  field."
[03:40:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Un-fucking-believable
[03:40:49] <PlanckWalk> So we agree there.
[03:41:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Did you ever apply, btw?
[03:41:46] <PlanckWalk> As I see it, the very complicated ones are much more likely to be less extreme since there's an upper bound on goodness, and complicated ones will dilute it a lot more.
[03:42:58] <PlanckWalk> A counterpoint to the "high dimensional balls are almost all crust" is that if you measure any given component of a random vector in a high-dimensional ball, it will almost always be close to zero.

[03:48:05] <gwern> as a counterargument to the extremely poisonous horrible gender 'research' agitprop that goes around? might be a bargain
[03:48:29] <gwern> PlanckWalk: my intuition would be the opposite. sort of a Ramsey theory argument: larger/more complicated universes can be much more extreme because they give much more scope for coincidences and workarounds
[03:48:57] <PlanckWalk> They might be locally more extreme

[03:50:01] <gwern> ...hell forever' to 'something happens to morally redeem this universe and make it net good'
[03:50:37] <gwern> the larger the universe, the bigger your hell can be because you have more universe to create a counter-army etc

[03:54:10] <saturn2> yeah

[03:54:59] <PlanckWalk> Symbolically central, not physically.
[03:55:52] <Ralith> you only have 17.4 good per universe, after all
[03:55:54] <Ralith> everyone knows that
[03:55:56] <PlanckWalk> The words/descriptions that differ more from the True Words have less goodness, and a more complex universe has more of them.

The film stars Dick Van Dyke, Sally Ann Howes, Adrian Hall, Heather Ripley, Lionel Jeffries, Benny Hill, James Robertson Justice, Robert Helpmann, …)

[09:14:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> So apparently you can do this in ObjC:
[09:14:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> [myObj :foo :bar];
[09:15:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because you can define methods with unnamed arguments!
[09:15:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> You won't get autocomplete in Xcode (because there's nothing to complete lol) and also Xcode will get confused and not indent the arguments correctly
[09:16:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it totally works
[09:18:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then we combine this with custom subscript access to get stuff like this:
[09:19:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> [_parser[@"1d20"] :SA_DiceExpressionOperator_PLUS :_parser[tryStringParts[1]]]
[09:19:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which previously would've been...

[09:25:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Oh and also with the unnamed-argument method, you can't use Xcode to "jump to definition" or access help for it, because both of those require clicking/hovering over the method name... but there is no method name lol)

He was born Leslie King Jr to his father Leslie King, then his mother divorced and remarried a man named Gerald Ford and he changed his name to Gerald Ford Jr. No wonder he became president!

[23:03:05] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Terry Bradshaw, CBS pregame analyst: I got a call at 4 a.m. from Greg Gumbel. He said, “Did you hear the news?” I said, “No, what?” He said, “Fox has the NFC package. They got it from CBS.” I went, “You gotta be kidding me.” I never even heard of Fox. Matt Millen, CBS analyst: When it came down, I said, “What’s Fox?” I’m not a TV guy. The answer was
[23:03:05] <feepbot> even more confusing. They said, “You know, it’s the one that has that cartoon show.”'
[23:08:05] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Over at Fox, the celebration took on an air of unreality. A network that half-existed in the minds of many viewers had just landed what Murdoch called, with a tabloid proprietor’s élan, “the crown jewel of all sports programming in the world.” To celebrate, Murdoch summoned his executives to his Manhattan apartment for a champagne toast. Krieger: Rupert says,
[23:08:05] <feepbot> “We’re going to my apartment to have drinks.” We had a mini celebration. Padden: I was there. I remember Mr. Murdoch rubbing his hands together and saying, “OK, now somebody tell me how they play this game!”'

[23:20:59] <feepbot> schlubby thing going to Albany and Kankakee. It would be like one of those Murder on the Orient Express parlor cars. It was going to be glorious. Frank: They offered him his own train car. That was appealing, but there was only one problem with it. It got you to the city but it didn’t get you to the stadium. He would still have a take a cab or car of some kind to the stadium and

I said, “What can you do?” They said,
[23:25:59] <feepbot> “Here is a permit for you to carry a concealed [weapon].” I said, “Well, you hang on to that because I like the number of toes that I have.” Goren: I come back to L.A., to the Sunset office, on Monday. There’s a phone message from one of our fine viewers in the Bay Area, who felt he could not watch the 49ers game because that damn box on the screen was distracting.
[23:25:59] <feepbot> “Either get rid of the box or I’ll find you!” A few days later, the window in my office was shot out. We went to the police, who told us, “No, it’s not the guy in San Francisco. It’s just a tough neighborhood.”'
