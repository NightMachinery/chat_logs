[00:30:10] <diverdude> Hi, i have this in my compose file: https://dpaste.org/6JS0 where tileserver command executes this script: https://dpaste.org/3vm1    But the problem is that when i run the compose file it just stays in the loop saying that it cannot connect to redis...even though i know that redis is up and running (i can connect to it from host and i can also see in log that its up). What am I doing wrong here?
[00:30:51] <diverdude> and how do i debug it?

[00:38:59] <ada_> diverdude: I assume that REDIS_HOST isn't set correctly
[00:39:07] <ada_> so the script isn't connecting anything so it continues looping forever
[00:40:04] <ada_> remember that anywhere there is a ${} the compose file is going to expand from your environment;  so that string is going to get replcaed with the *value* of REDIS_HOST from your shell.  you can run "docker-compose config" to see what would get expanded
[00:40:20] *** Joins: arinov_ (~arinov@88.230.49.132)

[00:45:25] <ada_> well its a step in teh right direction
[00:45:32] <ada_> because having the $ in both places is definitely wrong
[00:45:40] <ada_> now, make sure your shell has REDIS_HOST set to something
[00:45:57] <ada_> compose reads from teh shell, so `export REDIS_HOST=redis_host_container` in your current shell, then run docker-compose config
[00:46:06] <ada_> and it should read the value of REDIS_HOST from the shell and pass it into the container
[00:46:59] <programmerq> nedbat▸ docker sync sounds like a project that essentially copies or rsyncs stuff around for you. I'm not familiar with that. Folks will end up utilizing some sort of file copy mechanism if they want to share thousands of small files since the docker desktop sharing performs poorly in a usecase like that.

[01:01:46] <tabakhase> diverdude if its set now,.. to what value?
[01:02:06] <tabakhase> you shouldnt need to have a setable REDIS_HOST at all i guess if that redis is part of that compose-stack anyhow..
[01:02:37] <diverdude> tabakhase: ok, why is that?
[01:02:50] <diverdude> and it is
[01:03:13] <tabakhase> so redis host will always and forever be "zuiredis"
[01:03:48] <diverdude> tabakhase: yeah true...thats also what i have set it to
[01:04:06] <tabakhase> and you dont have a version: tag in your compose file? without you wont get the free networking
[01:04:34] <tabakhase> version: "2.4"  -- or so, on the first line
[01:04:52] <diverdude> tabakhase: yeah i do...i just didnt paste it... i have version: "3.7" on the first line of my compose file
[01:05:10] <tabakhase> 3. is fine too yea =)
[01:06:40] <diverdude> tabakhase: but whats superweird is that if i docker exec into the container where the webserver runs and then opens a python terminal and connect to redis via the redis library - it works great...i can connect to redis...But when i try to connect from within the webserver code - which is also running in that same container...i get connection cannot be established :(

[03:43:47] <BtbN> Then just re-implement ahead and connect to its IP/hostname instead
[03:43:50] <mekhami> i just don't know what the right tool is for intercepting that
[03:44:04] <BtbN> Well, if you do want to _intercept_ it, you do seem to care about the hostname
[03:44:18] <BtbN> in which case you'd need to be able to have a valid certificate for it, unless it doesn't use TLS
[03:45:31] <mekhami> so... is it not possible then?
[03:45:48] <BtbN> That's nearly impossible to tell without in depths knowledge of that service
[03:46:10] <BtbN> You can probably roll your own CA, and self sign it. "just" need to get that client to trust the cert
[03:46:25] <BtbN> But there won't be a step by step guide for any of that
[03:46:31] <mekhami> right.
[03:46:33] <mekhami> hm.
[03:46:48] <BtbN> The general intercepting will require a bunch of iptables magic
[03:46:55] <BtbN> Don't think Docker will just let you do that
[03:48:22] <mekhami> i suppose, more reasonably, i can just have my base twilio url be configurable

[05:37:35] <tabakhase> (also note that ""5432:5432"" puts those ports to the internet - you likely want a) "127.0.0.1:5432:5432" if its just for you - or "no ports at all" when only containers shall connect - no need to publish for this =)
[05:38:06] <tabakhase> and localhost is mupitz sure - containers have there own entwork stack, and so there very own localhost
[05:38:26] <tabakhase> you want to connect to "db:5432"
[05:39:28] <tabakhase> (docker-compose gives you a user-defined-network/named-network automagically so those things work by service name then)

[06:24:26] <supsup> hi, i'm trying to use the docker file found in github project: https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/blob/main/Dockerfile   which has a guide: https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/wiki/Using-Slate-in-Docker.  -- the issue is when i run the 'dev' mode command to create an image:  docker run --rm --name slate -p 4567:4567 -v
[06:24:27] <supsup> $(pwd)/source:/srv/slate/source slatedocs/slate serve
[06:24:53] <supsup> if i update my host file @ $(pwd)/source -- it never updates the container
[06:25:24] <supsup> is the dockerfile cacheing the work directory  and makes it immuntable ?
[06:26:32] <supsup> even tho i tell it to mount the source directory to the folder in the container?  oddly if i inspect the running container it shows me the mount point in the correct location on each sid
[06:26:50] <supsup> but no edits ever go to the running container

[06:28:25] <artok> supsup: docker build creates image using Dockerfile instructions, docker run creates container using docker image... anyhow, using docker for mac/win ?
[06:28:39] <supsup> mac
[06:28:51] <supsup> yeah i create the image from the dockerfile
[06:29:11] <supsup> then i execute docker run --rm --name slate -p 4567:4567 -v $(pwd)/source:/srv/slate/source slatedocs/slate serve from the host github folder
[06:29:52] <supsup> it seems like it never changes once i create a container
[06:30:04] <supsup> unless i shell out to it and change it manually
[06:30:31] <supsup> but if i change a file in the host -- and shell out, file is not changed on the mount
[06:31:58] <supsup> i was wondering if syntax in the dockerfile (which i used to make the image) has some conflict with mount points?
[06:33:00] <supsup> or is there something extra i have to do since im using a mac
[06:35:14] <artok> it doesn't sync that directory between mac fs and that virtual machine that is running the docker
[06:35:30] <supsup> correct
[06:36:32] <supsup> i edit $(pwd)/source/index.html.md   on host --> no change in container

[09:48:46] <Tabmow> Have you looked at the documentation at all? WORKDIR just sets your current working directory. How will that resolve the issue I told you above?
[09:50:14] <guy_frm_yogaland> I'm not 100% sure if WORKDIR respects the current user

[16:11:29] <JohnDoe2> uh huh, so what you're essentially saying is that Docker isn't necessarily a nice portable one-file type thing. I have to first create an image, then use docker run to mount a volume, then use docker cp to copy file to container, then run commands inside the container to install whatever software...?
[16:12:35] <artok> docker is not virtual machine, you do dockerfile that prepares service(software) you're going to run containerized, then you do docker run to start the container and do runtime configurations

[16:16:44] <artok> read about data persistency on docker manual
[16:17:50] <JohnDoe2> I've been reading the manual and googling, to a new user it's beyond confusing between docker and its run, exec, and then you have docker-compose and each one has specific things it can do 
[16:19:04] <JohnDoe2> all this to copy a jar file into a solr container. Which so far I'm assuming I have to create a Dockerfile which has the COPY command in it, then create the image from it, then run the image with docker run which can pass solr-precreate nameofproject and mount volumes for data persistence
[16:20:20] <JohnDoe2> I don't even know what the command is to create an image from a dockerfile but that's what google is for

[16:21:04] <tabakhase> docker-compose kinda isnt anything "extra" - just a way to wrap your 4623 characters long docker command worm into a yaml file ;-)
[16:21:36] <JohnDoe2> right, but not quite because not everything is possible with docker-compose that is otherwise possible with docker run
[16:21:38] <artok> + 15 other docker commands =)
[16:22:01] <artok> docker compose can do what docker run cand o
[16:22:08] <tabakhase> hm na, pretty much everything is in there, 99% with the exact same names
[16:22:31] <JohnDoe2> I had to give up on docker-compose because data ownership was broken
[16:22:32] <tabakhase> sometimes a extra _ or such :P
[16:23:13] <tabakhase> ((in the back, docker-compose translates that back to docker commands, and then calls the api just the very same way your "docker-cli command does" ya could say))
[16:23:24] <JohnDoe2> specifically, the solr:latest image has issues working with volumes but if I pass --user $(id -u) to docker run then the container ishappy
[16:24:22] <tabakhase> user: is supported in compose too, to get the id you can use ENV-vars, and prestore those in a automatically read ".env" file next to it (gitignored)
[16:24:38] <artok> on docker compose user:${UID}
[16:25:45] <tabakhase> indeed $UID exists already ;D
[16:25:50] <artok> user: "${UID}:${GID}"
[16:25:56] <artok> getting that gid also =)
[16:26:12] <JohnDoe2> I think I tried that too and it still was being weird
[16:26:31] <JohnDoe2> chowned the mountpoint on host, chmod 777, still solr complains about no write access
[16:28:08] <artok> then we get to that favourite thing I like to preach... not using bind mounts and doing entrypoint script that will handle permission checks =)
[16:30:25] <JohnDoe2> well preach on preacher because I know "bind" and I know "mounts" but have no clue what they mean together for docker. If the entrypoint runs as the user inside docker it can't modify permissions. And solr specifically has no sudo support.
[16:31:07] <JohnDoe2> (I did try chown from within the container when I was trying to resolve the issue, and of course, gotta be root because the files are somehow owned by root)
[16:32:14] <artok> JohnDoe2: you start container as root, and then descalate into uid after permission checks
[16:34:45] *** Parts: printf (~printf@user/printf) (The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[16:36:00] <JohnDoe2> can you start any container as root?
[16:37:09] <artok> it is normally started as root, --user will change that
[16:37:39] <JohnDoe2> aka user: under the service name in docker-compose.yml ?

[16:38:10] <JohnDoe2> because I just did that and the files created by volumes: are again owned by root
[16:41:23] <tabakhase> for bind-mounts there is one more tripwire - if the path doesnt exist, docker creates it, and docker itself runs as root - so this is just before were even talking about containers at all

[16:42:55] <JohnDoe2> yup, read that too, created the folder as the host-user, proper perms and the files inside it are root-owned although the container itself runs as a random user
[16:42:57] <tabakhase> (and ther eis like a tripple disconenct cause numemric ids are shared, while names(/etc/passwd) is not, crossmixed with "my uid wont be your uid" runtime vs buildtime issue
[16:44:30] <tabakhase> in the end not rly hard and you pretty much "just pick one of the 3 methods based on use" -- but the first time around its like 10 different things to gasp at the same time before being able to produce anything :D
[16:46:35] <JohnDoe2> I'm sure it's not hard, it's just all over the place :D right now I feel rather trapped because as a newbie all I see is roadblocks. To copy a jar file I have to use a Dockerfile which doesn't mount volumes, but docker run eventually will. Apparently docker-compose can do the same thing, but no, it can't copy a file over to a container.
[16:47:59] <JohnDoe2> and then a bunch of oddities with volumes, then the official solr image making no sense to me: no way to sudo, yet it creates files as root on its own and then proceeds to complain about permission issues. 🤯

[17:37:28] <programmerq> nedbat▸ based on the earlier compose file you showed, it looks like you didn't have a bind mount from the host on that container at all, so there would need to be some independent process that copies it over since it does update on a delay-- whether that is docker-sync or something else entirely. with a bind mount, it's literally mounting the same file into the container so there's no delay. the
[17:37:31] <programmerq> file sharing into the VM is an extra layer, but you can see that is working by doing something like: docker run --rm -it -w $PWD -v $PWD:$PWD alpine sh
[17:37:38] <programmerq> and then doing an ls as you make changes on the host.
[17:37:44] <ada_> s0ullight: docker-compose run <service>
[17:38:07] <ada_> s0ullight: docker-compose up <service>
[17:38:20] <s0ullight> thanks!
[17:38:23] <ada_> they are slightly different
[17:38:46] <nedbat> programmerq: i understand more about this.  There are a number of compose files being used at once, including this one: https://github.com/edx/devstack/blob/master/docker-compose-host.yml#L24-L31
[17:40:49] <programmerq> oh interesting-- that changes things a bit. The :cached bit *can* introduce a small delay, but I'd expect that to be on the order of milliseconds.
[17:41:36] <programmerq> if you do ls/cat does it show the old file? or is it a code reload type process that may be looking for inotify events?

[17:50:08] <nedbat> programmerq: an ls in the container shows the old size and moddate. It takes an hour for it to catch up. (once it was 57 minutes, but in three tests, twice it was literally 60 minutes)

[17:54:33] <s0ullight> my db changes don't persist between two docker-compose up/down runs
[17:55:00] <[twisti]> s0ullight: how do you persist the db data files ?
[17:55:40] <s0ullight> I'd like them to be part of the volume?
[17:55:59] <s0ullight> the docker app shows that new volumes are created for each run
[17:56:11] <s0ullight> can I make it reuse a volume?
[17:56:49] <[twisti]> you could use a named volume
[17:57:06] <[twisti]> or bind it to a path on your hdd
[17:57:26] <s0ullight> I want the first option

[17:59:41] <[twisti]> probably, but thats really not how you want to do that
[17:59:50] <programmerq> nedbat▸ I'd say do the test where you fire up a container manually with a bind mount and see if the problem is there too. That'll help determine if it's a problem with the osxfs filesharing layer in the docker desktop VM.
[17:59:58] <[twisti]> you only want to mount where that container stores its data, not the entire container
[18:00:44] <nedbat> programmerq: that was my next step: to launch a much simpler container to see if it still happens. If you have a suggestion of a container to use, that would save me some time.
[18:00:55] <s0ullight> postgres:/var/lib/postgres/data sounds better then
[18:00:58] <s0ullight> thanks!
[18:01:44] <[twisti]> s0ullight: mind you that you need to define the volume too, see https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#use-a-volume-with-docker-compose
[18:05:30] <s0ullight> [twisti] what do you mean,
[18:06:03] <[twisti]> s0ullight: click the link, it shows how you correctly define a named volume with docker-compose
