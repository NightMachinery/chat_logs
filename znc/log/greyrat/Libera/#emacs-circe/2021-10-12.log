[13:24:37] <jtgd> (starting using circe today, coming from weechat) How do I suppress the NAMES at the start?
[13:29:30] <wasamasa> you could disable that particular numeric, but then the /names command won't work either
[13:31:17] <jtgd> ok
[13:31:38] <jtgd> I'm not seeing this work with Bitlbee. should I expect it to?
[13:31:47] <wasamasa> bitlbee is... special
[13:31:55] <jtgd> ?
[13:32:26] <wasamasa> but perhaps you want to clarify what "this" means
[13:34:29] <jtgd> circe. When I connect to bitlbee through circe, it does not work. when I join a "channel" (Facebook messenger group chat) no messages go in either direction
[13:35:07] <wasamasa> (circe-set-display-handler "353" 'ignore)
[13:35:11] <wasamasa> (circe-set-display-handler "366" 'ignore)
[13:35:18] <wasamasa> that should take care of NAMES
[13:35:29] <jtgd> ok thanks
[13:36:16] <wasamasa> have you verified bitlbee works with a different client?
[13:36:31] <wasamasa> and that it's not exclusive to facebook messenger?
[13:36:32] <jtgd> yes
[13:36:46] <jtgd> works fine with weechat
[13:37:27] <wasamasa> what about other bitlbee protocols like jabber?
[13:37:44] <jtgd> I was able to go through the process of setting up the facebook accounts, but msgs don't pass through.
[13:37:50] <jtgd> I don't use jabber
[13:38:03] <wasamasa> facebook messenger is jabber in a trenchcoat
[13:38:05] <wasamasa> just saying
[13:38:21] <jtgd> years ago messenger used to be jabber, yeah
[13:38:58] <jtgd> they changed it
[13:39:09] <wasamasa> I have my doubts they use something else internally
[13:39:10] <jtgd> bitlbee has a special plugin for facebook
[13:40:30] <wasamasa> thing is that I cannot help you with facebook, besides looking at debug logs
[13:41:09] <jtgd> hmmm...
[13:41:52] <wasamasa> you can enable these with (setq irc-debug-log t)
[13:42:17] <wasamasa> and then look at the debug buffer
[13:42:24] <jtgd> maybe I have to go back to weehat. I really like circe though. lots of nice features. If this is not a known issue I'll keep banging on it.
[13:42:31] <jtgd> oh ok
[13:43:05] <wasamasa> the only known bitlbee issue is that it doesn't support lagmon
[13:43:09] <wasamasa> same with twitch
[13:43:18] <jtgd> what is lagmon?
[13:43:40] <wasamasa> it's well-known that both twitch and bitlbee are behaving slightly off-spec, but that goes for pretty much all IRC servers, so eh
[13:43:52] <wasamasa> lag monitor
[13:44:02] <wasamasa> detects when there's too much lag and automatically reconnects
[13:44:09] <jtgd> ok well I don't think I need lagmon
[13:44:16] <wasamasa> the detection is broken with bitlbee though, so it reconnects all the time
[13:44:24] <jtgd> oic
[13:45:12] <jtgd> is there any more docs than what's on github?
[13:45:16] <wasamasa> no
[13:45:37] <jtgd> I notice the docstring in emacs doesn't match the doc.
[13:46:20] <jtgd> like :tls or :use-tls
[13:46:50] <jtgd> I guess I would trust the docstring more
[13:47:14] <wasamasa> both work
[13:47:58] <jtgd> thanks for your help
[13:48:41] <jtgd> oh, is there a way to do a mass /join on connect, as it does with channels?
[13:49:06] <jtgd> sorry, I meant /query
[13:49:40] <wasamasa> what if you go for usernames rather than channel names?
[13:49:41] <wasamasa> TIAS
[13:50:28] <jtgd> if I get the bitlbee working, I do /join for group chats but /query for individuals
[13:50:46] <wasamasa> nope, it doesn't work
[13:51:09] <jtgd> ok, well a little elisp should do it.
[13:51:13] <wasamasa> right
