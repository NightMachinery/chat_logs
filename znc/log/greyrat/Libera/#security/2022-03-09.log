[03:51:28] <Evolver> but it's less bad than the ISP DNS
[03:52:28] <piou> essentially stun is involved for anything related to peer-to-peer communication between your browser and a server (typically for real-time communications since that's where latency may be an issue). So if you ever want to do conferencing or even some chat protocols through the browser, blocking the stun server will be an issue
[03:52:48] <Evolver> yup
[03:54:13] <Evolver> Perfect cover
[03:54:31] <piou> stupid conspiracy
[03:54:40] <Evolver> My chat looks to be working fine here without it. Nothing else warranted it.
[03:55:25] <piou> just remember not to blame firefox the day something doesn't work
[03:55:38] <piou> now I don't think you'll find a fork of firefox that removes such useful features by default, but since you seem very privacy oriented maybe https://librewolf.net/ would be of interest to you

[03:55:39] <Evolver> If that ever happens, I look at the block log, and unblock.
[03:57:24] <Evolver> Speaking of privacy, I have a story for you. Whenever I go to my mom's place, her cable box picks up keywords we talk about, and then shows ads about it on the TV, e.g. for arthritis meds, and various other meds.
[03:57:44] <Evolver> so I guess it's always listening
[03:58:21] <Evolver> Thanks for the librewolf mention!
[03:58:22] <tty1> Evolver: Librewolf disables peerconnection by default, so there ya go
[03:58:23] <piou> that's unlikely, and can be explained through simpler ways. Did you open it to see whether there's a microphone?
[03:59:27] <Evolver> no but I can utter some magic words close to it to see if it then shows me ads, e.g. blood pressure, overweight.
[03:59:52] <piou> yeah, next time check, it's extremely unlikely that it even has a microphone

[04:06:26] <Evolver> It used to accelerate the misformatting to where the user gives up and restarts.
[04:06:34] <Evolver> Now it just disallows opening a new tab!

[04:16:35] <Evolver> and not for regular use
[04:17:15] <piou> I'm curious to know what's this special use case but I feel like I'm not going to know. It's probably a bad idea though. Note that DNS requests would not go through the vpn.
[04:17:31] <Evolver> I do need DNS to go through it!
[04:17:35] <yhirose3> Evolver: why not just use the TOR browser? It works on regular sites as well.

[04:21:57] <ajak> what are you even trying to do
[04:22:15] <tty1> OpenVPN for selective proxying seems like overkill. ssh into your box, get socks5 going with -D, and set the browser to use a socks5 proxy in a separate FF profile

[16:08:14] <yhirose3> The only alternative is to write custom mail exchanger software that intercepts documents and removes macros before delivering them to the mailbox

[16:11:50] <yhirose3> But signed exectuables just run - without any "Would you like to run this"

[16:12:39] <yhirose3> I don't get what you mean by being tied to Microsoft? These trading systems are developed for Linux
[16:12:48] <piou> but they're all company secrets because that's the part that makes money for these investment banks
[16:12:49] <yhirose3> Maybe with a front end GUI written for Windows
[16:13:03] <godSend23> ohhh
[16:13:22] <piou> yhirose3: yes, signed executables, this removes the majority of malwares really
[16:13:57] <piou> yhirose3: there are ways arround it, sure, but it catches the majority of them, and the fact that they still work serves to show that users happily give permission
[16:14:22] <yhirose3> piou: why would it remove malware? Microsoft code signing only validates that the code came from a certain developer, but does not verify that the code is legitimate. Anyone can create malware and get it signed

[16:17:52] <piou> yhirose3: here's my proposal: windows doesn't need any more lockdown features to improve its security. What it needs first and foremost is to change the bad habits of its users which stem from the default installation procedure for windows programs: search the internet, find a website (who knows if it's official), download an installer ("installer"?), launch it. This workflow is very flawed and
[16:17:58] <piou> gives the habit of trusting outside programs without much question. So I'd say that first and foremost windows should develop a proper software center, doing the same as android that properly taught its users to be wary of external installations, allowing the use of more restrictions on external programs, etc.

[16:21:27] <piou> that you need to change habit to enable these restrictions, and that habit can only be changed by changing the default way to do things
[16:21:37] <yhirose3> I also personally think that we should get away from using programs all together - use excel in a browser so that it's confined to a sandbox
[16:21:58] <yhirose3> I mean if you really think about it, assuming you're the security director for a company, why not just make everything a website?
[16:22:08] <yhirose3> Use Google Sheets or Microsoft Office online
[16:22:21] <yhirose3> Integrate that with Google Drive/ OneDrive / DropBox / Amazon S3
[16:22:29] <yhirose3> Email is already mostly online too
[16:22:40] <piou> I think people should stop putting everything in the browser where it's more vulnerable and difficult to secure than a standalone program
[16:22:54] <piou> Also less reliable
[16:23:00] <godSend23> wonder if an open source ATS can rival any close-source one
[16:23:02] <piou> if the network falls, excel still works
[16:23:04] <newsense> ^^
[16:23:21] <piou> If all you want is a sandbox, there are good sandboxes for standalone programs
[16:23:41] <piou> there's no reason to expose the application to latency issues, server load issues, web security issues, etc
[16:23:47] <newsense> Everything as a website is the reason the web sucks
[16:23:58] <yhirose3> godSend23: what's an ATS?
[16:24:30] <piou> web disponibility is a real issue
[16:24:44] <godSend23> sry my acronym for autotrading systems
[16:25:17] <piou> be it because you need to work while comuting, or because the failsafe program of wind turbines should still work if they are disconnected from the internet
[16:26:17] <yhirose3> Well I mean I don't see the point in an open source ATS because code would continually need to be updated
[16:26:27] <yhirose3> Also an ATS should be geared towards your own objectives
[16:26:32] <piou> (and yes, that's a reference to the 6000 Deutch wind turbines that recently stopped working after a Russian cyberattack cut them from the internet)
[16:27:01] <piou> (sorry, their emergency stopping system stopped working, still)
[16:27:06] <yhirose3> I mean obviously there is a need for programs but I'm talking in the context of an office worker with no tech experience
[16:27:37] <yhirose3> They are, in themselves, a security vulnerability, and web apps seem to solve that
[16:28:04] <piou> you mean, the people that think the entire internet collapsed if their network cable isn't properly plugged in?
[16:28:19] <piou> sure, let's put everything on the network, that'll make it easier to grasp
[16:28:39] <piou> some do, but I hardly see it as a solution, or even a good idea
[16:28:42] <godSend23> yes, i agree w/ yhirose3
[16:28:55] <yhirose3> piou: why would you say it's not a good idea
[16:28:58] <godSend23> none of my friends use excel anymore; we rely on management systems
[16:29:01] <godSend23> that's gui base
[16:29:11] <piou> godSend23: anecdotal
[16:29:22] <godSend23> w/ backend sqls at best
[16:29:45] <yhirose3> on the excel note, I didn't mention SQL databases. I think SQL is a good middle ground between programming with python and macros. It also has the added advantage of being scalable to petabytes.
[16:29:48] <godSend23> then have ATS w/ different objectives like linux distros yhirose3
[16:29:57] <godSend23> arch, deb, manjaro
[16:30:29] <godSend23> catering to audiences w/ or w/o programming exp
[16:30:36] <piou> yhirose3: for the reasons I explained: making it a web app is increasing the failure surface, making it less certain that they can run the application at all, and will never remove or even decrease the fact that as long as they keep the habit of trusting things coming from the network and launching it you'll have security issues in that regard
[16:30:45] *** Joins: rinzewind (~rinzewind@user/rinzewind)
[16:31:22] <yhirose3> godSend23: you would need the ATS to integrate with your stock broker. As it happens, investment banks are their own brokers. It would also need access to market data which is costly and would need to connect to paid APIs. I think it would be difficult for an open source project to cater for all brokers and all market data apis.
[16:31:26] <piou> yhirose3: most people can't manage to make a secure website, and their professionals, and we want to put everything in the web? Even without any attacker the risks in term of disponibility are great if the entire company relies on it.
[16:32:06] <piou> can it be done? sure. Do some people do it? Yes. Is that enough to think that it's a good idea? No.
[16:32:23] <godSend23> oh man... ic yhirose3 ; info should be free flowing! but thanks for laying out the challenges there
[16:32:26] <piou> If you want a sandbox arround excel, launch excel in a sandbox
[16:32:55] <piou> don't put excel into a web browser where its attack surface is greatly increased

[22:47:08] <ash_worksi> TheRedRipper: are you familiar with OAuth 2.0?
[22:49:01] *** Joins: nuclearg1 (~nucleargr@user/nuclearg1)
[22:49:13] <ash_worksi> TheRedRipper: OAuth is a mechanism by which you can identify clients; the most useful (ime) of these is using an "authorization code"

[22:50:23] <ash_worksi> TheRedRipper: To give a real world example, you can login to codesandbox.io using github
[22:51:40] <TheRedRipper> ah yeah i think i know 0auth
[22:51:50] <TheRedRipper> o*
[22:52:03] <ash_worksi> TheRedRipper: what happens is, codesandbox.io forwards you to github.com/oauth/authorize (or w/e); there you login and start a session with github so Github can identify you and know it's you; then github generates a code and responds with Location: codesandbox.io/callback?code=...
[22:52:12] *** Joins: ___nick___ (~quassel@cpc68286-cdif17-2-0-cust533.5-1.cable.virginm.net)
[22:52:32] <TheRedRipper> ohhh okay
[22:53:24] <ash_worksi> so you're redirected back to codesandbox.io with a code as a query parameter, codesandbox.io will send that code back to github... you cannot see this happen, since this communication just takes place between codesandbox.io servers and github servers
[22:54:07] <ash_worksi> when github gets the request from codesandbox.io and validates the code, it gives codesandbox.io a token... now anytime codesandbox wants to do something with your account on github, it can use this token
[22:54:21] <ash_worksi> for example, if you want to save a code snippet you made to github
[22:54:48] *** aog is now known as gary
[22:55:06] <ash_worksi> TheRedRipper: now about my question: there are 2 types of tokens github can give out; they can be "self-contained tokens" or "opaque tokens"
[22:55:19] <ash_worksi> an "opaque token" is just a non-guessable string
[22:55:43] *** Quits: gary (~aog@user/aog) (Killed (NickServ (GHOST command used by garyunsanctioned!~tor@user/gary)))
[22:55:58] *** Joins: aog (~aog@user/aog)
[22:56:14] <TheRedRipper> so why wouldnt anyone want opaque tokens that sounds like 3x more secure right?
[22:56:33] <ash_worksi> if codesandbox.io has an opaque token, then it must send that token to github in order to validate it, because only github knows what the token means
[22:56:59] <ash_worksi> if codesandbox.io has a self-contained token, then codesandbox can validate it without sending it anywhere
[22:57:15] <TheRedRipper> yeah
[22:57:31] <ash_worksi> the reason it can do this is because the token has a signature which is basically the same content as the token itself, except encrypted
[22:57:55] <TheRedRipper> okay that makes sense
[22:57:58] <ash_worksi> in that case, codesandbox.io would have to be given a key of some kind
[22:58:24] <ash_worksi> so codesandbox.io will use that key to decrypt the "signature" and check if it matches the payload
[22:58:59] <ash_worksi> this makes it so that no one can tamper with the payload
[22:59:40] <ash_worksi> I have only discussed this with one other person, and they seem to really only care about JWT (self-contained tokens)
[23:00:03] <TheRedRipper> yeah
[23:00:20] <TheRedRipper> i think i got the jist of it, i think opaque sounds better
[23:00:20] *** Quits: BOKALDO_ (~BOKALDO@user/bokaldo) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:00:32] <ash_worksi> but, the way I see it, although JWT's can be validated more easily, this is unncessary for truely 3rd party communication (like the example I painted)
[23:00:36] <ash_worksi> truly*
[23:01:05] <ash_worksi> I mean... I take that back
[23:01:08] <TheRedRipper> because if only the og hosty login thingy can verify the token wouldnt it be more secure?
[23:01:30] <TheRedRipper> albeit probably more complicated, it would be better against people trying to token log
[23:02:05] <ash_worksi> well, the basic concept is "so long as the only thing you can do is read the token contents, it doesn't matter"
[23:02:23] <TheRedRipper> yeah
[23:02:31] <TheRedRipper> but if they can do more, then it would be worse right?
[23:02:34] <TheRedRipper> theoretically
[23:02:58] <ash_worksi> yes, it is heavily advised that tokens do not contain sensitive data
[23:03:15] <TheRedRipper> well of course
[23:03:24] <TheRedRipper> do people use tokens with sensitive data??
[23:03:29] <TheRedRipper> god i hope not
[23:03:39] <ash_worksi> several years ago, it was an issue
[23:03:54] <TheRedRipper> yeah
[23:03:58] <ash_worksi> esp before localStorage browser apis were available
[23:04:04] <TheRedRipper> thats how the minecraft token exploit came about right?
[23:04:10] <ash_worksi> I have no idea
[23:04:27] <TheRedRipper> people were stealing peoples tokens and logging in as them because they had sensitive data and werent encrypted
[23:04:29] <TheRedRipper> iirc
[23:04:42] <ash_worksi> oh, that can still happen

[23:05:49] <ash_worksi> I'll check it out
[23:06:11] <ash_worksi> in any event, to finish my thought, it is now recommended that you use "authorization code + PKCE"
[23:06:26] *** Joins: m6wiq (~m6wiq@51.148.147.13)
[23:06:50] <ash_worksi> which is a kind of "on the fly" hash used by the client -- this is supposed to verify that code exchanged for a token is coming from a legit client
[23:07:00] <TheRedRipper> yeah that sounds smart
[23:07:27] <ash_worksi> but even that can be hijacked if the users browser is compromised (eg by a malicious extension)

[23:07:37] <ash_worksi> so they've come up with DPAP
[23:07:42] <TheRedRipper> yeah i think i would prefer opaque, it seems a bit more complicated yes, but there is security and useability upsides if im understanding correct
[23:07:57] <ash_worksi> which is a 3rd mechanic that is... basically an application-level mTLS
[23:08:00] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[23:08:25] <ash_worksi> the main difference between opaque and self-contained is "network" vs "storage"
[23:08:38] <ash_worksi> JWTs are ... fairly large

[23:11:01] <ash_worksi> s/I/A/
[23:11:40] <ash_worksi> but an opaque token you will just be using a client to call a token/introspection endpoint to check validity
[23:11:40] <TheRedRipper> 'I very small payload I used generated a JWT 720 chars long' beg pardon?
[23:11:51] <TheRedRipper> yeah

[23:12:15] <ash_worksi> A** very small payload I used to generate** a JWT 720 chars long
[23:12:24] <ash_worksi> sorry, brain not working
[23:12:26] <TheRedRipper> im sorry but i dont see the downside to opaque? is it just slower or smth? or just more complicated to implement?
[23:12:30] <TheRedRipper> lol all good
[23:13:03] <ash_worksi> depends on the perspective I guess -- note that authentication of tokens happens on resource servers
[23:13:09] <ash_worksi> in my example, that would be github
[23:13:41] <TheRedRipper> yeah
[23:13:48] <ash_worksi> but if github is a distributed system (which I would bet it is) then the login system would probably be discrete from a repository system
[23:13:58] <TheRedRipper> yeah
[23:14:13] *** Joins: slikislik (uid190389@id-190389.hampstead.irccloud.com)
[23:15:38] <ash_worksi> so the main question is, when you call `POST api.github.com/theredpepper/somerepo {data...}`, do you want to have to forward the token every time to `POST github.com/token/introspect {token...}`
[23:16:00] <TheRedRipper> oh see that would eat internet wouldnt it?
[23:16:18] <ash_worksi> it would if the api is in a different data center than the login system
[23:16:33] <ash_worksi> but probably not very much on a LAN
[23:16:38] <TheRedRipper> every time you try to call, it sends token, sends to center, then verifies, then back to server, then back to user
[23:16:47] <ash_worksi> yeah
[23:16:50] <TheRedRipper> yeah okay i can see that
[23:16:55] <TheRedRipper> that would be slow
[23:16:59] *** Joins: easyriders (~easyrider@xb9b5df82.cust.hiper.dk)
[23:17:08] <ash_worksi> note that you only cut 1 leg with JWT
[23:17:27] <ash_worksi> but this is also why people probably used to abuse it and stuff more state into then then they were designed for
[23:17:31] <TheRedRipper> yeah because it can be verfied from the smae server right?
[23:17:45] <ash_worksi> if it's RSA, anyone can verify it
[23:17:50] <ash_worksi> (they just can't change it)
[23:18:08] <TheRedRipper> yeah that doesnt seem too secure
[23:18:10] <TheRedRipper> right?
[23:18:25] <ash_worksi> well, none of this works off the premise of "hand your token out willy nilly"
[23:18:31] <TheRedRipper> rsa = Remote Server Access?
[23:18:40] <ash_worksi> RSA as in openssl
[23:20:06] <ash_worksi> Rivest–Shamir–Adleman encryption algorithm
[23:20:12] <TheRedRipper> yeah so JWT would be fasterish but lesser secure, opaque is secure but slowerish?
[23:20:55] <ash_worksi> I mean if an attacker obtains your token (be it opaque or self-contained) they have access to your account
[23:21:20] <ash_worksi> the only question is how large the payload is, or how many requests you make
[23:21:46] *** Joins: jpw (~jpw@user/jpw)
[23:23:02] <ash_worksi> when I say "anyone can verify it" that is to say, anyone with the token... in a secure system that would be the "client" (codesandbox.io) the "owner" (TheRedPepper) the "resource server" (api.github.com) and the "authorization server" (github.com/login)
[23:23:43] <TheRedRipper> hmmst okay
[23:24:02] <ash_worksi> the plus side about tokens (in general) is that the scope of damage can be stemmed by revoking the token
[23:24:09] <ash_worksi> also, tokens only allow specific tasks
[23:24:15] <ash_worksi> and they do not reveal credentials
[23:24:43] <ash_worksi> but to keep things completely secure you either need to implement mTLS with the client, or use DPOP
[23:24:49] <ash_worksi> and now I have to eat
[23:24:54] <ash_worksi> but thank your input :)
[23:25:54] <jpw> hey, question, im trying to train some undergraduates in computer security at work.

[23:36:38] <ash_worksi> not that this matters all that much, but a final point to make is that people use the authorization code grant for javascript clients

[23:37:08] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:37:38] <ash_worksi> SPAs and JS MPAs are what (afaict) led to the sloppiness of JWT implementation
[23:37:50] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth)
[23:38:02] <ash_worksi> because you could stuff a bunch of data into a JWT and then use that to populate certain things in your SPA
[23:38:25] <TheRedRipper> ah okay
[23:39:18] <ash_worksi> also JWTs sometimes contain certain things that may having meaning to an application and look sensitive, but are not
[23:39:37] <ash_worksi> which might've confused people years ago when they read a JWT and see "admin: true" or something
[23:40:31] <ash_worksi> but the purpose of this might be to expose some admin links. They wouldn't work in your application if the token is invalid
[23:40:58] <ash_worksi> it would be like you making a direct request to `GET /user/profile` without logging in
[23:41:23] <ash_worksi> you'd just get a 403.
[23:42:37] <ash_worksi> in any event, people indeed are not encouraged to use the authorization code grant + PKCE for SPAs
[23:42:56] <ash_worksi> now*
[23:43:02] <ash_worksi> are now* encouraged
[23:43:51] <ash_worksi> because in this context the JS application is the "3rd party" (codesandbox.io)
[23:44:52] <ash_worksi> with a key difference being that you can see the backchannel requests in your browser console.

[23:52:24] <ash_worksi> I am atm just (wasting time really) thinking of a way to write the OAuth2 standard as a set of feature files
[23:52:53] <ash_worksi> and have come up with likening tokens to movie tickets
[23:53:04] <ash_worksi> and authorization codes to valet tickets
[23:53:38] <ash_worksi> I figure, I'll write the features and then just translate the terminology
[23:54:00] <ash_worksi> something I don't have a "word" for though is Ticket vs Stub
[23:54:12] <ash_worksi> a token is really a TicketStub
[23:54:37] <ash_worksi> an opaque token can only be validated by matching a ticket stub to a ticket
