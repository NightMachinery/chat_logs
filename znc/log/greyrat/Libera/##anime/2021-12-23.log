[00:17:47] <MootPoot> that chai tea I would guess is probably about 30g or so
[00:17:59] <MootPoot> even with no sugar, the lactose from the milk and cream
[00:24:10] <Satin> jesus
[00:24:15] <Satin> i'm going to just let it sit then
[00:24:17] <Satin> fuck lol
[00:24:24] <Satin> i drank a slight bit but won't drink the whole thing
[00:24:29] <Satin> also the thermo arrived
[00:25:02] <Satin> is bacon keto friendly
[00:25:17] <MootPoot> Its not a death knell if you have that much-  people do say the limit is about like 50g 
[00:25:25] <MootPoot> but thats more 50g if you want to do low carb
[00:25:29] <MootPoot> instead of keto
[00:25:35] <Satin> yeah
[00:25:36] <MootPoot> I do on average maybe 5-6 g a day
[00:25:44] <Satin> 5-6g of carbs?
[00:25:46] <MootPoot> yes

[00:48:39] <KatrinValerie> I keep forgetting to fix my bitlocker setup
[00:48:46] <KatrinValerie> this bs requires secure boot for some reason
[00:49:03] <KatrinValerie> and my debian isn't setup for secure boot right now
[00:49:15] <MootPoot> wym , secure boot is integral to how it works
[00:50:19] <KatrinValerie> I never cared about the details, I just let windows do its thing when it installed
[00:50:46] <KatrinValerie> and it asked if I wanted disk encryption and I said yes and now it somehow needs secure boot or I need the restore key on every boot q.q
[00:50:49] <MootPoot> since when did you run windows anyway
[00:50:57] <MootPoot> I thought you were a linux diehard
[00:51:01] <KatrinValerie> I run it for games since anchient times
[00:51:07] <KatrinValerie> only for games do I boot it
[00:51:32] <KatrinValerie> and I am a horrible noob at windows these days, because I spend almost all of my time on linux
[00:51:32] <MootPoot> 2.5" hdd pricing is weird
[00:51:49] <MootPoot> the extrnal is like 30-50% cheaper then the internal
[00:51:55] <MootPoot> but 3.5 its the opposite
[00:52:22] <KatrinValerie> painted my nails and only two came out with a good finish, I am not good at this q.q

[05:46:27] <Nanobot> You're probably wondering, "What are NFTs and how can I invest in them?" NFTs are digital autographs. To use an analogy, let's say you go to an artist's studio to purchase a painting. The artist gives you the painting, along with a signed photo of the painting. The signed photo is the NFT. Except, instead of a photo which can be viewed independently of the painting, NFTs just have a hash of the file data. As with a signed photo, you can sell or gift NFTs 
[05:46:27] <Nanobot> to other people, but the blockchain technology prevents you from making copies of the NFT. It doesn't affect what you can do with the painting in any way. And, just like a real autograph, there is nothing preventing the artist from making any number of NFTs for any number of identical images. How to invest in NFTs: 1. Short them.

[05:49:31] <MootPoot> Nanobot: now write a LN plot based off NFTs
[05:49:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or rather, no, they can't be useful.

[05:50:13] <MootPoot> Nanobot: How goes the food deliveries 
[05:50:17] <Nanobot> amigojapan: Then, the image would be public. So, everyone would have it, and anyone could copy it freely.
[05:50:43] <amigojapan> Ah right Nanobot 
[05:51:21] <Nanobot> amigojapan: But no, they couldn't store it in the blockchain. It's way too much data. It means every person running a node would need to have a copy of *every* media file anyone ever made an NFT for, on their computer.

[05:56:50] <Nanobot> Aurora_v_kosmose: Well, to be fair, lots of companies would LOVE media scarcity to exist. DRM is an attempt to create digital scarcity. However, NFTs don't create scarcity for media, they only create scarcity for the autographs.
[05:57:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nanobot: And scarcity for media is introducing an unnecessary bug.

[11:21:49] <amigojapan> Hi bbear1 
[11:22:36] <Nanobot> I'm catching up on the latest season of Fool Us with Penn & Teller. I just saw the rock paper scissors act. I'm really shocked that Penn & Teller couldn't figure it out, because I noticed the trick before even the first prop swap happened, and I correctly predicted the outcome of each round before any of the swapping.
[11:23:54] <amigojapan> Nanobot become the new Penn and teller
[11:24:03] <Nanobot> All you need to know is the initial outcome (who beats whom before any swapping) and whether they're swapping an even or odd number of times. And the magician dictated both factors.
[11:25:05] <amigojapan> I see
[11:26:11] <Nanobot> If A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A, then swapping any two will reverse the direction (A loses to B, B loses to C, C loses to A). Another swap brings you back to the original outcome.
[11:26:31] <amigojapan> Nanobot: back when David Copperfield did a TV card trick. He told people what to do thru the TV. But I repeated the trick many times and figured it out. It always came out the same

[12:46:05] <zoidberg> not towards condoms 
[12:46:21] <zoidberg> ah, I see
[12:46:50] <emmeka> my school had free condoms in the nurse's office on Wednesdays. I'd estimated 95% of them ended up being used in pranks, as slingshots, or wrapped around the locks on people's lockers
[12:46:53] <zoidberg> I read it's not pleasurable with condom, not sure how much truth is in it.
[12:47:18] <zoidberg> slingshots?
[12:47:26] <MootPoot> can confirm slingshots are brillant uses for condoms
[12:47:30] <MootPoot> kek
[12:47:39] <zoidberg> lol, what the dickens!
[12:47:41] <emmeka> it's stretchy and has a good wet snap to it. works excellently as a sling
[12:48:01] <zoidberg> never heard of such thing
[12:48:38] <MootPoot> if you set it up right, you can use it as either a finger slingshot or slingshot the entire condom with your hand
[12:48:48] <MootPoot> with the condom being the projectile
[12:49:04] <emmeka> go buy yourself a box of condoms, zoidberg. experience all the dumb shit you've missed out on. and also be prepared or whatever
[12:49:14] * MootPoot remember giving another dude a facial by flinging a milk filled condom at him in class
[12:49:19] <zoidberg> box of condoms, lol
[12:49:29] <MootPoot> emmeka: tbh condoms are kinda $$$ 
[12:49:30] <zoidberg> how much do condoms cost anyways?
[12:49:33] <emmeka> yoghurt filled condoms were a stable of pranks

[12:49:58] <MootPoot> idk why, but its dumb

[12:50:20] <emmeka> zoidberg well, it's been a long long while since I had to buy condoms
[12:50:28] <MootPoot> but once you actually look at the prices in IRL stores, its like a dollar , or a dollar 50 each 
[12:51:18] <MootPoot> condoms are also pretty good for keeping dirt getting in your barrel when out with a rifle

[17:55:33] <amigojapan> Wikipedia says this "In the field of medicine, there is some belief that the stories relating to encounters with succubi bear resemblance to the contemporary phenomenon of people reporting alien abductions,[20] which has been ascribed to sleep paralysis and hallucinations from their contemporary culture. Furthermore, the experience of nocturnal emissions or "wet dreams" may explain the sexual aspect of the phenomenon.[2"

[23:28:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: Sort of. If the programs you use don't rely on direct access to others without being explicitly wayland compatible.
[23:29:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That mostly means other than screencapture, input method and key-typing, it works.
[23:29:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Out of the box, that is.
[23:29:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The other three have to do some wayland-specific stuff.
