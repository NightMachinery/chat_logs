[00:59:25] <[itchyjunk]> <kveroneau> I wonder how many studios Microsoft needs to buy before they get a new anti-trust case knocking at their door.
[00:59:33] <[itchyjunk]> there are 100's of studios out there.
[00:59:48] <[itchyjunk]> why would purchasing few large one cause anti trust issue?
[00:59:58] <kveroneau> So 100 more studios until we see a new anti-trust case? :)
[01:00:01] <flakland> build 32bit browser if you want to use RAM efficiently
[01:00:06] <[itchyjunk]> number of titles released a year is in thousands
[01:00:14] <[itchyjunk]> via 100's of studios.
[01:00:14] <kveroneau> One word:  Monopoly
[01:00:21] <nomagno> Microsoft can not be penalized by an antitrust lawsuit
[01:00:24] <[itchyjunk]> they bought 60 out of a few thousand titles.

[01:04:10] <ProfSimm> nomagno: at the same time think of web APIs, vast majority use named arguments on JSON objects
[01:04:50] <nomagno> ProfSimm: That's because JSON objects are used as key-value pairs by most people

[01:09:43] <[itchyjunk]> Check out Halo infinite.
[01:09:51] <[itchyjunk]> MS spend $500 M on that game.
[01:10:25] <nomagno> Google is 3x Spain's GNP
[01:10:28] <kveroneau> Wasn't that suppose to be an Xbox Series X launch title?
[01:10:28] <nomagno> For instance
[01:10:39] <[itchyjunk]> Halo infinite? No.
[01:10:48] <[itchyjunk]> It was released on xbox and pc at the same time.
[01:10:53] <[itchyjunk]> It also got released a month ago.
[01:10:58] <epony> GOOG does not produce hardware and goods and has a lot less workers that do not produce any GDP in no country.
[01:10:59] <[itchyjunk]> series X has been around for over a year.
[01:11:06] <kveroneau> I know there was a Halo set for launch with the new console, but it had some issues and needed to be reworked.
[01:11:14] <[itchyjunk]> Fortnite has ~40M monthly active players.
[01:11:24] <[itchyjunk]> MS probably bought activision to add titles to their game pass.
[01:11:29] <epony> so.. this "dollar" share price valuation is fictitious on the internal stock / share markets
[01:11:30] <[itchyjunk]> and the mobile platform.
[01:11:41] <[itchyjunk]> Mostly mobile platform, thats where they are struggling the most.
[01:11:48] <kveroneau> Who owns Fortnite again?  I know it's another pretty large company.  Epic?
[01:11:59] <kveroneau> Epic has been around since the MS-DOS games.
[01:12:12] <[itchyjunk]> Eouc games.
[01:12:44] <epony> in fact, these companies are just "big money" but in bank assets, in reality are a couple of buildings and about 100K employees each
[01:12:48] <[itchyjunk]> Buying a studio only gives you franchise namesake.
[01:13:01] <[itchyjunk]> Halo was originally a Bungie product.
[01:13:10] <[itchyjunk]> They had to drop it to sever ties with MS.
[01:13:34] <[itchyjunk]> So MS might have bought a few studios then too, like 343, but didn't stop bungie from making new titles
[01:13:37] <[itchyjunk]> like destiny
[01:13:52] <kveroneau> I just wish they never bought Rare though...
[01:13:53] <flakland> halo was originally supposed to be a PC game, then microsoft threw a mountain of cache at them
[01:14:04] <kveroneau> Rare was soooo goood pre-Microsoft.
[01:14:15] <[itchyjunk]> It was originally a pc game.
[01:14:23] <[itchyjunk]> halo 2 came out on pc.
[01:14:37] <[itchyjunk]> they made the pvp part an xbox thing.
[01:14:43] <flakland> halo, the only noteworthy game for xbox uno
[01:14:51] <[itchyjunk]> That is because it used to be easier to manage anti cheat on console than pc
[01:15:02] <kveroneau> A lot of people also craze about this game called Forza too.

[01:54:23] <Kerr> Not that I'd recommend that over python for osmeone learning
[01:54:49] <dTal> I have problems with Python as a teaching language
[01:55:05] <kveroneau> Why's that?
[01:55:09] <dTal> It requires mastery of a lot of conceptual overhead, very early on
[01:55:17] <Kerr> I think I was 6 or so when I read "qbasic programming for kids" and thought it was awesome. I just wish someone had set me up with a c compiler a year or two after that
[01:55:47] <dTal> compare basic: 10 PRINT "COOL": 20 GOTO 10
[01:55:59] <dTal> you need line numbers, goto, and print. That's it
[01:56:02] <kveroneau> C can get really complicated really fast for someone who doesn't understand pointers.
[01:56:20] <kveroneau> I always found strings so annoying in C.
[01:56:21] <dTal> and python: while True: <indent> print("Cool")
[01:57:05] <kveroneau> I almost forgot about line numbers lol
[01:57:07] <dTal> for which you need while (concept of control flow), indent (concept of code block), parentheses on print (concept of a function)
[01:57:35] <kveroneau> I'd teach for before while.

[01:57:49] <dTal> for is even worse
[01:57:52] <kveroneau> for is a bit easier to grasp in any language as it's finite.

[02:37:13] <nomagno> Kerr: in 2012 or possibly earlier, the DWG CAD format library was LibreDWG, but GNU switch from GPLv2 to GPLv3. This made its license incompatible with existing CAD software, which definitely didn't kill the software itself, but definitely destroyed interest
[02:37:21] <nomagno> 2012 yeah
[02:37:32] <tomathy> flakland: think that's divide and divide :)
[02:37:42] <nomagno> GPLv3+ is incompatible with GPLv2-only
[02:38:13] <flakland> the library should have been LGPL then?
[02:38:35] <Kerr> That's what it sounds like to me
[02:38:39] <nomagno> flakland: Not really, was explicitly used in GPL'd software
[02:38:43] <tomathy> why is memory logic like 99x harder than combinational logic?

[02:39:01] <nomagno> GNU provided a GPL library because GPL software devs had interest
[02:39:04] <flakland> so instead of rewriting the lib they gave up?

[02:45:22] <kveroneau> nomagno, I used sockets for the components to communicate to easily allow it to be spread across multiple servers or docker containers with ease, and also allow 3rd party components to be used, but not need to share the same license of the main codebase.
[02:45:56] <kveroneau> At least those were my thought behind the ideas to use sockets in the way they are used.

[03:49:24] <epony> the point is, these things are like that because of the assembler / machine code and registers / number representation in the hardware
[03:49:38] <bjs> No, that's implementation defined.
[03:49:45] <bjs> Undefined behaviour is almost entirely about allowing optimizations
[03:50:19] <vdamewood> InternetCitizen: So, it's getting stored as 00 00 00 00 00 00 f8 3f. When objdump looks it, it breaks that down to two 32-bit values, [00 00 00 00] and [00 00 f8 3f], it then 'fixes' the individual 32-bit values.
[03:50:36] <epony> well, that's exactly the same thing, you know what happens in machine code, you allow the high level language to give that capability to the programmer without forcing limitations
[03:51:10] <[404]> arahael: Oh, so I can't use it over Internet?
[03:51:11] <bjs> epony: it's most certainly *not* the same thing, and is exactly why C has *two* different possibilties, C can decide something is undefined or it can decide if something is implementation defined.

[04:56:32] <bjs> larrykma: not at all, they're basically the same idea. Just Haskell takes it much further, notably by extending it to all user-defined algebraic datatypes (whereas the shell only has strings, duh) and allowing you to bind names to parts of the match (which is the seriously useful part)
[04:56:57] <larrykma> bjs, and C's switch and haskell's case is also basically the same idea, except haskell takes it further
[04:57:57] <sonny> basically the same lol
[04:58:04] <epony> yeah, sounds cool, to be able to address generalised namespaces like that
[04:58:35] <bjs> larrykma: yes but there's a key difference, in that the way C's switch statement works is fundamentally different to the way Haskell/shell pattern matching works. In Haskell/the shell the patterns are tried one after the other, until a pattern (not a single value) matches the input value. 
[04:58:49] <epony> we can take it further, put your thinking caps, to locality of the matching ;-)

[05:02:25] <bjs> C's switch is a similar idea but a different implementation

[05:05:03] <bjs> larrykma: well regexes match strings, and shells pretty much only deal with stringy data so it's not surprising it chose regexes for the pattern matching. It still works pretty much the same way Haskell's case statement does, which are both very similar and very different to C's switch.

[05:43:23] <epony> you know, programming languages are just "UI" fluff (grammar and syntax).. so are mostly a matter of personal taste and preferences, what matters is the implementation details of the underlying compiler construction toolkit
[05:43:24] <ProfSimm> rindolf: like
[05:44:25] <ProfSimm> epony: the UI is the key though isn't it. a lot of what's happening under is fungible, and dependent on your computer's architecture
[05:44:28] <epony> so, whatever decade you live in.. there is something to pick and like, but you just can't have all the features you want on languages that are not used

[05:54:39] <pulse> you need a basic workable subset and then you can expand it whenever needed
[05:54:51] <pulse> with C, you can just learn all of it. because it's simple
[05:54:53] <ESphynx> C is relative quite simpel to learn actually

[05:57:49] <ESphynx> you can write a library in eC , and generate bindings automatically to C, C++ and Python

Everything was going great until the favored son of the townsfolk raped the favored daughter of the tribe.  The townsfolk were mortified, because they didn't want to sour the relationship with the tribe, so they proposed a solution:
[10:02:00] <apotheon> The rapist and his victim would get married, so it would all be okay!
[10:02:29] <apotheon> The tribe conferred in private then said "Okay, sure, but first every man in town has to get circumcised."

[17:02:30] <teut93> and there are two scores , one in "submissions" and another in "difficulty"
[17:02:36] <DarkTrick> InPhase, thanks for the follow-up! Yes! That's a problem :D I'm still working on it
[17:02:58] <debayer948> programmar: haha no i mean, the entire data set has to live in memory for redis. it is not great if memory is your bottleneck
[17:03:12] <debayer948> sqlite will be a flat file and is only limited to the disk space for it
[17:03:16] <mishugana> yes, it's useful for small keyvalue pairs for configuration et al
[17:03:20] <programmar> debayer948: Oh yea, now that's bad :(
[17:03:58] <programmar> according to its page, it uses around 85MB to 160MB of ram if there is 1 million smalls Key or 1 million keys 
[17:04:02] <debayer948> programmar: what language will the clients be
[17:04:09] <programmar> i mean my database will never cross one million tho
[17:04:21] <programmar> it hardly ever cross one hundred

[17:04:29] <GeDaMo> teut93: I think you might need FROM Hackers, Submissions, Difficulty because of the HAVING clause

[18:29:53] <ski> (well, it's typically better to use the term "codomain" for the latter .. because the term "range" is overloaded. sometimes it means the subset of values of the codomain which the function can actually output (for some possible/allowed input). but we can also talk of the "range" of a variable, as in the set of values it is allowed to take on)

[19:35:26] <kubrickdave> out of curiosity, on a system without memory protection and memory mapped IO, a stack overflow (i.e. infinite recursion) could theoretically cause hardware damage (writing trash to device registers), right?

[19:37:00] <oldlaptop> (maybe "Apps Script" can do less than VBA in ways that aren't direct consequences of the things it controls being less bloated, but it's certainly good enough for lots)

[19:39:24] <kubrickdave> there was also a bug in lenovo laptop firmware, where deleting EFI variables bricked the thing
[19:39:58] <kubrickdave> and because linux exposes EFI vars in the VFS, it could be triggered by 'rm -rf /*'

[19:45:44] <macaw> apotheon: I'd say you are right. Yet, are there good pricing models for community-produced software which bring enough money to be sustainable? Otherwise, we're relying on charity from the devs. The devs have to be incorruptible, also.

[19:47:38] <GeDaMo> :)
[19:47:50] <oldlaptop> the trust that proceeds from money changing hands exists in that case
[19:48:29] <apotheon> I didn't say there was a perfect solution anywhere, though . . . the solution is probably "Don't create laws allowing sustainable entities of incomprehensible complexity, because without them nobody can sustain incomprehensibly complex systems for long."  The solution, in other words, is replacing things when they get too complex for people to maintain them.
[19:48:48] <oldlaptop> macaw: Taking donations and/or selling things on terms that amount to donations can work okay-ish.
[19:48:52] <apotheon> A big enough corporation can keep something incomprehensibly complex alive for far too long.
[19:49:02] <oldlaptop> Different things work for different communities and different situations.
[19:49:19] <kubrickdave> i will bring those examples up, when i need to explain to someone what the purpose of a segfault is. :)
[19:49:56] <apotheon> With smaller projects, unsustainable without various subsidies (direct and indirect), sustainability creeps in at much smaller complexity scale, necessitating replacement when something goes rogue.
[19:49:58] <oldlaptop> I'll also say I don't see how "OMG, corpration!!1!!" has anything to do with mozilla's technical judgement, which is... "much" of the grounds for disagreement

[19:53:58] <oldlaptop> apotheon: "corporation" is a very broad term, especially legally
[19:54:09] <apotheon> Without the legal instrument (and without something else taking its place), the recursive complexity sustainability in the world would necessarily diminish.

[23:18:36] <apotheon> I don't know enough about either Kotlin or Swift to offer much in the way of intelligent commentary, though I do know a bit more about ObjC and Java.
[23:18:55] <apotheon> Oh, yeah, I was going to comment on the library situation.

[23:19:54] <apotheon> the Scheme problem, essentially
[23:20:30] <apotheon> The entire ecosystem of Scheme is made up of language implementations, pretty much.

[23:25:01] <apotheon> I fucking hate the fact the whole of the ECMAScript world has essentially consigned one of its best features to the garbage heap, replacing it with a giant, ugly pile of crap.
[23:25:07] <apotheon> I refer, of course, to OOP support.
[23:26:02] <apotheon> The core of a great prototype-based object model lurks within the language, just waiting for someone to finish building it, but it has eighteen metric tons of shitty class-based hacks on top of it, suffocating the good bit.
[23:26:04] <pulse> it's not even really OOP
[23:26:19] <pulse> it's just some syntax sugar
[23:26:45] <apotheon> To be fair, most OOP is syntactic sugar.
[23:26:58] <pulse> no it's... kind of well defined
[23:27:16] <pulse> it has to support the 4 pillars for me to actually consider it oop
[23:27:19] <apotheon> I'm not talking about the idea of OOP.  I'm talking about implementations.

[23:32:02] <nomagno> For me to consider a language OOP it needs to support inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction. Polymorphism doesn't really convince me, probably because I only do C coding lately :P
