[01:57:00] <kurahaupo> If source didn't work, that's just the old version of bash not playing nicely with a pipe
[01:57:03] <jeaye> ./prog -c "git log; tree" # prog is doing something like a chroot

[02:00:02] <kurahaupo> Are you sure you want to let the parameter string run in a way that affects the internal state of prog? Eg "exit" causing it it terminate
[02:00:27] <jonesmeier> and it is "git log" that's supposed to see the input "tree" ?
[02:00:39] <kurahaupo> Unless that's a specific design goal, use sh -c "whatever"
[02:00:44] <jeaye> jonesmeier: Nope, separate commands.
[02:01:06] <jonesmeier> oh, then i thought that should work
[02:01:20] <jeaye> kurahaupo: Ah, so that'd be the difference between sh -c and eval. Makes sense to me.
[02:01:21] <emanuele6> maybe jeaye wants `git log' be showed in a pager

[02:01:36] <jeaye> Nope. Just an example of two commands with output.
[02:01:40] <kurahaupo> by "just bash" do you mean "a program written as a bash script", or the actual bash executable itself?

[10:00:08] <grawity> most Unix things treat \n as line terminator, not separator
[10:00:28] <grawity> so text files are just always expected to end with a \n and it's not considered an "empty line"

[14:13:55] <obiwahn> What could be the meaning of the the eval exec. Up to now i have always used exec if i wanted the a process to replace bash.
[14:14:15] <Soliton> the exec probably does nothing.
[14:14:33] <obiwahn> of course not:P `declare -r RO_SERVER_BINARY="${RO_SERVER_HOME}/bin/ro_server"

[14:14:46] <greybot> By convention, environment variables (PATH, EDITOR, SHELL, ...) and internal shell variables (BASH_VERSION, RANDOM, ...) are fully capitalized. All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables. https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html
[14:14:56] <obiwahn> yes i told him 1000 times
[14:15:09] <Soliton> the parameters should be an array.
[14:15:11] <obiwahn> but it must be consistent with past
[14:15:33] <Soliton> server_bin "${params[@]}" &
[14:15:48] <obiwahn> :) array is one of the most frequent words in the review
[14:15:54] <Soliton> unless the eval actually served a purpose.
[14:16:00] <obiwahn> there are no files when iterating over files as well
[14:16:16] <obiwahn> which i find confusing and will not work if there are whitespaces
[14:16:27] <obiwahn> but to be honest they are not expected...
[14:16:43] <Soliton> no need to write bad code just because it might work anyway.
[14:17:12] <obiwahn> i can not imagine that the server spits more out than an exit code.

[15:48:20] <tercaL> Hi there. I'm getting list of lines with cat and grep. With the help of uniq/sort, I'd like to shape that list so that only 2 and more repeating lines would be listed. Currently with | uniq -c | sort -ur, I get that but I'd like to remove the lines that's seen only 1 time.
[15:48:24] <tercaL> Any idea on that?
[15:49:57] <Soliton> !seen
[15:49:57] <greybot> awk '!seen[$0]++' # Remove second and subsequent instances of each input line, without having to sort them first.
[15:50:10] <Soliton> remove the exclamation point.

[16:04:42] <tercaL> the HTTP request that I fetch starts with '?' so for awk '/\?' is correct I assume?
[16:04:45] <Soliton> uniq will only consider the previous line, btw.
[16:05:09] <Soliton> you need to escape the ?, yes.
[16:05:13] <tercaL> /?user
[16:05:21] <tercaL> previous line? how?
[16:05:25] <Soliton> the first / is not part of the regex.
[16:05:35] <Soliton> by remembering the previous line...
[16:06:13] <Soliton> # printf '%s\n' 1 2 1 | uniq
[16:06:14] <shbot> Soliton: 1
[16:06:14] <shbot> Soliton: 2
[16:06:14] <shbot> Soliton: 1
[16:07:28] <tercaL> without | uniq, the command awk '/\?user=/{if (seen[$1]++) print $1}' *-db.log outputs same IPs in multiple repeating lines.
[16:07:44] <tercaL> and with | uniq, I get the same IPs only in a single line.
[16:08:03] <Soliton> there is no reason other than the input data that the lines need to repating consequitively.
[16:08:15] <Soliton> be repeating*
[16:08:39] <Soliton> if you get the same IP some time later in the log uniq will not care.

[16:36:29] *** Joins: willyg_cos (~willyg_co@user/willyg-cos/x-4994202)
[16:36:38] <grawity> alternative approach: use -i.bak and remove the .bak afterwards
[16:36:43] <Soliton> i would rather stop rewriting the same file twice.
[16:37:02] <bancroft> that too, but there's a v in some and no v in others
[16:37:04] <grawity> but yes you can e.g. put the whole "s/pyenv-([0-9]{1,}.[0-9]{1,}.[0-9]{1,})/pyenv-${PYENV_VERSION}/" in a variable, put the file name in a variable, etc
[16:37:11] <grawity> and you can do two s// commands per sed invocation
[16:37:16] <Soliton> so use v\{0,1\}
[16:37:25] <grawity> e.g. sed "s/foo/bar/; s/baz/quux/"
[16:37:33] <Soliton> well, v? with -E.
[16:37:45] <bancroft> the problem with that is that I need the non-v to be renamed with non-v, and the v's to be renamed WITH a v
[16:37:55] <grawity> then use a backreference in the replacement
[16:38:01] <Soliton> capture the v then.
[16:38:08] <bancroft> I don't know what that is
[16:38:18] <grawity> s/pyenv-(v?)(1,etcetc)/pyenv-\1${PYENV_VERSION}/
[16:38:30] <grawity> the first () group can be referenced using \1, the second using \2 and so on
[16:38:49] <bancroft> that's really cool
[16:38:58] <grawity> s/hello (jim|fred)!/bye \1!/
[16:40:12] <grawity> the group in your example seems to be unneeded
[16:40:41] <grawity> so it all could be 2 lines:
[16:40:44] <grawity> sed -Ei.bak "s/pyenv-(v?)[0-9]{1,}.[0-9]{1,}.[0-9]{1,}/pyenv-\1${PYENV_VERSION}/" docker/python-base/Dockerfile && rm docker/python-base/Dockerfile.bak

[19:11:08] <greybot> "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105

[22:20:17] <lopid> do you know what `set -e` does?
[22:21:01] <ablegreen> lopid: it exits if a command fails right??
[22:21:22] <greycat> that's an overly simplistic statement, but partly true
[22:21:23] <lopid> it exits if a command returns non-zero
[22:21:55] <ablegreen> but running `ssh-add -L | base64 | tr -d '\n'`, its exit code is 0 for me
[22:22:23] <lopid> do you know what pipefail is?
[22:22:28] <grawity> but is the exit code still 0 if you enable pipefail before it?
[22:22:37] <grawity> what's the exit code of `ssh-add -L` alone?
[22:22:47] <ablegreen> if one of the commands in a pipe operation returns non-zero, it exits?
[22:22:55] <ablegreen> let me check `ssh-add -L` alone
[22:22:59] <greycat> ablegreen: that's what you told it to do, yes
[22:23:09] <ablegreen> oh DOH it says no agents
[22:23:36] <grawity> iirc it exits with 1 if no agent, 2 if no keys found in agent
