[12:27:31] <The-Compiler> I know content.proxy needs some time to get applied in QtWebEngine/Chromium (that's documented in its help). I would have hoped that doesn't apply when setting it initially though...

[13:08:15] <The-Compiler> futune: I added a comment, I can't seem to reproduce based on a quick test
[13:12:23] <futune> The-Compiler, calling qutebrowser with -s content.proxy ... works here too
[13:12:42] <futune> i.e. same as your result
[13:20:09] <The-Compiler> futune: hm, and how do you set that config value? In config.py?
[13:21:35] <futune> :set content.proxy ..., and it appears to be saved in .config/qutebrowser/autoconfig.yml
[13:23:45] <futune> I'm having trouble reproducing my bug in a synthetic way now myself
[13:25:40] <futune> that is, i can reproduce it easily with my large and organic list of tabs, but that is private and i do not want to share it
[13:26:05] <futune> it is consistent with the organic tabs
[13:27:06] <The-Compiler> futune: what kind of requests do you see in Wireshark? Could there be anything special about them (e.g. could they come from JS or something)?
[13:27:43] <futune> The-Compiler, I'm mainly filtering for dns requests
[13:28:03] <futune> they could come from js, I do not know
[13:31:54] <futune> cnn.com seems to work well for reproducing
[13:32:04] <futune> i got the bug now with just that tab
[13:33:26] <futune> qutebrowser --temp-basedir -s content.proxy socks://localhost:9050 cnn.com
[13:33:38] <futune> the bug triggers with this
[13:37:29] <futune> the majority of the dns requests seem to be adtech and cdn domains, maybe it does have to do with js?
[13:42:01] <The-Compiler> futune: DNS isn't proxied, so if all you see is DNS requests, that's working as intended
[13:42:40] <The-Compiler> futune: don't see how anything about that would change after a few seconds though
[13:43:35] <futune> The-Compiler, I thought I have seen this before with non-dns traffic, but my memory could be wrong

[14:22:14] <futune> It appears that dns requests are proxied inconsistently, I think if the application asks the socks5 proxy to open hostname, then the dns request for hostname will be handled by the proxy and thus proxied 
[14:23:27] <futune> but there is nothing stopping the application from resolving a hostname on its own, which will use the system resolver and bypass the proxy
[14:24:55] <futune> and both of these paths seem to occur in qutebrowser
[14:25:59] <futune> the second kind of behaviour seems problematic to me, but I think my original issue was not accurate
[14:26:12] <futune> should I make another?
[15:03:18] <bedlam> I reported the issue about leaking socks5 to the chromium devs years ago.
[15:03:39] *** Quits: emagex (~user@user/emagex) (Quit: brb)
[15:04:17] <futune> there is the setting content.proxy_dns_requests, but it's set to true by default

[15:06:08] <bedlam> You any good with patching things?
