[00:50:05] <artok> still.. not going to change =)
[00:50:07] <matsaman> what on earth does 'ERROR: Cannot locate specified Dockerfile: Dockerfile' mean?
[00:50:24] <artok> matsaman: just that
[00:51:21] <artok> where did you specify the file, is the working directory right, is there correct relative/absolute dir, does the file exist?
[00:53:09] <s17> the Dockerfile named Dockerfile
[00:53:42] <matsaman> I've changed three things in some docker-compose yml files from before this error: an 'image:' value, a 'context:' value, and another 'image:' value
[00:53:55] <matsaman> the context one I'm most suspicious about
[00:54:24] * artok always tells to build outside of docker-compose
[00:54:44] <matsaman> build with 'docker' alone, and then if desired continue with docker-compose?
[00:54:58] <matsaman> s17: heh
[00:55:04] <artok> yeah, that keeps your buildtime and runtime separated
[00:55:14] <matsaman> artok: and fewer problems in your experience, too, I guess?
[00:55:29] <matsaman> docker-compose does have a 'build' command for only building, too
[00:57:41] <artok> but as you can see, you have problems... go into your dockerfile dir and hit docker build there and keep context inside that same directory with proper .dockerignore... you'll get smoother building, can have it on repo alone, put it into CI easily
[00:58:03] <matsaman> I'll certainly try that, thanks
[00:58:30] <artok> pushing images into registry service is always good thing
[00:58:45] <artok> not only using local builds and stuff
[00:59:34] <matsaman> I think the person who set this up actually means for only a premade image to be pull'd, but that's not what's happening
[01:01:35] <matsaman> okay and now I'm seeing they also set this up with no consideration for using it with docker alone, all the dockerfiles are just lumped together with each other in a single dir
[01:03:08] <matsaman> I think one of these images has some rigid deps and for some reason it's trying to compile them. Think I'll have to figure out what those deps are.
[01:03:59] <matsaman> Or maybe it's just that one image's stuff is wanting a higher version of the other's. There's no QA on this mess.
[01:07:05] <matsaman> guess I can use build -f

[01:40:08] <twiclo> I'm tasked with setting up our new environment for the small ISP I work for. Because we're an ISP we have 4 datacenters which makes me not interested in any cloud stuff. Right now we're happy with a proxmox cluster but I'm open to suggestion on that. You'd have to make a pretty compelling case to get me to swithc
[01:40:19] <twiclo> The questions I have come to deployment of our programs. Should they all be in docker containers? Does each docker container get it's own VM? Should we set up ceph?
[01:40:27] <twiclo> What does a standard proxmox-docker setup look like?
[01:40:34] <twiclo> We have a storage server set up in our cluster right now. If we go with ceph should I decommission that server and just have every node also have a bit of storage to be a part of the ceph cluster?
[01:44:19] <artok> if you're working on ISP company, you're making questions that you should ask when you have meeting with CTO
[01:45:34] <artok> starting with question : "what does customer need"
[01:46:46] <twiclo> The CTO is sitting right next to me and has left it up to me to decide
[01:47:03] <twiclo> Well this doesn't really relate to the customer. This is to run internal tooling
[01:47:19] <artok> still it starts with customer needs
[01:48:42] <twiclo> We need to run internal tooling for ~50 people. We'll need one DB for everything and backups and whatnot

[01:56:04] <twiclo> There are 30-50 people here with 2 developers. We're not all that interested in sinking time into the "zero downtime" rabbit hole
[01:57:33] <artok> if you're ISP, I'd say that zero downtime shoule be your business, without extra work, you'd get that into your tooling as easily as to customers
[01:57:49] <artok> s/shoule/should
[01:58:40] <twiclo> We want zero down time with our network, not our crm/mapping software

[03:03:21] <Lutin> artok we need to fork them ;)
[03:04:54] <Lutin> don't go to their discord channel... they are pretty dumb actually about what a container question is or what an application question... don't debate that.. they are right :)
[03:05:21] <Lutin> and they think debating the question is helping out hehe
[03:05:41] <Lutin> discord is really for gaming nerds that's for sure
[03:07:50] <aab_> that isn't true there are plenty channels not for gamers
[03:08:25] <Lutin> aab_ you know what I mean... the issue is... discord is not ment for support things like github projects
[03:08:54] <artok> whhh
[03:09:02] <Lutin> artok drink beer :P
[03:09:07] <aab_> so don't use the support channels there.  If people didn't use them they wouldn't be a support channel there
[03:09:39] <artok> linuxserver.io is nothing to fork, as you'd need to write everything by yourself anyways
[03:09:57] <Lutin> aab_ that's the issue, it are not support channels it are just people being fancy and blaming everything else when they get questions...
[03:10:19] <Lutin> artok yeah they do too much in container in my opinion
[03:10:56] <Lutin> artok try to write the percona xtradb yourself... good luck :)
[03:11:33] <artok> they have build toolchain in the container image that isn't actually build toolchain container... eh.. 
[03:11:41] <Lutin> the issue with docker(hub) is... there is no regulation, quality check, whatever... if there was you could have some nice base images
[03:11:58] <Lutin> artok hehe
[03:12:20] <artok> and using s6 on everywhere
[03:12:29] <Lutin> artok installs on runtime for such things as WG, which is pretty stateless, is already wrong

[14:38:44] <Lutin> artok what I see is that docker on cli doesn't honer the subnets I told it to handout
[14:49:20] <Lutin> artok this is weird btw... only one node has this rule: ACCEPT     udp  --  anywhere             anywhere             policy match dir in pol ipsec udp dpt:4789 u32 "0x0>>0x16&0x3c@0xc&0xffffff00=0x100700"

[20:34:51] <Shariff> Hi there
[20:35:11] <Shariff> Is a docker stack like a swarm but on 1 machine, as opposed to a swarm on multiple (virtual) machines?
[20:40:56] <Lutin> yes and no... stack is just a namespace
[20:41:39] <Shariff> Ah.. and anything within that namespace can be spread around 1 or multiple (virtual) hosts... more an organization tool?
[20:42:23] <artok> stack is n services that work usually together, deployed to 1 to n nodes
[20:42:50] <Shariff> Got it, thanks!

[21:11:40] <artok> using your own?
[21:18:24] <thanas> Let's say I want the contents of three Docker containers in my own custom Docker container. Would the Dockerfile just consist of three FROM statements, or do I have to be explicit on what I want to copy from each container?
[21:20:30] <programmerq> you'd need to be explicit about what you want to copy. COPY --from <stageorimage> src dest
[21:23:26] <thanas> thank you programmerq
