[00:33:45] <lungaro_> it seems dirty to grab the second half of bits for 79 using 0x0000ffff
[00:34:00] <ikke> why?
[00:34:12] <lungaro_> not sure, cause its a shift for the former value

[00:42:49] <seebs> yeah, if they're negative, you'll want the `&0xffff` on both of them.
[00:42:50] <nitrix> The >> 16 could also be & 0xffff0000 to be symetrical.
[00:43:19] <seebs> Yeah, but if you right-shift a thing with the high bit set, and it's signed, Go will fill with sign bits.
[00:43:27] <nitrix> But then you have to shift it later.
[00:44:09] <nitrix> So it's pointless. I don't think it can get more readable that that.
[00:44:29] <seebs> in this case, i think shift and then mask is probably better. so hi = (x >> 16) & 0xffff, lo = (x >> 0) & 0xffff.
[00:44:37] <seebs> Admittedly, >>0 doesn't DO anything, but it makes the parallel clearer.
[00:44:56] <nitrix> That's normally what I do in C as well. The >> 0 is useless but it creates symmetry.
[00:45:40] <lungaro_> hmmm
[00:45:43] <lungaro_> that is cleaner
[00:45:57] <lungaro_> i like it, thanks
[00:46:54] <seebs> There was actually a proposal for Go 2 that someone wrote to make anything like that, or "+ 0", etc, an error, because you should never have code that doesn't do anything.
[00:47:15] <seebs> Sadly, the Go community code of conduct prohibits threatening to hunt people down and kill them even if they're very wrong. :(

[04:31:30] <codebam> thanks
[04:32:54] <codebam> if I want to run a function based on what a string is, should I use a switch or is there a better way?

[12:02:01] <mrig> Hello
[12:02:46] <mrig> If using self referential functions to make a recursive loop, would using a context be a reasonable way of stopping that loop from the outside?
[12:03:23] <ikke> either that, or wait for a stack overflow? :)
[12:03:46] *** Joins: jcajka (~jcajka@89-24-144-111.customers.tmcz.cz)
[12:04:10] <mrig> heh, perhaps the former would be better than blowing up the stack! :)
[12:04:15] <ikke> It depends on the nature of this recursive loop
[12:04:18] *** Joins: sizeof_void34 (~Thunderbi@109.252.75.112)

[12:04:53] *** Joins: chovy (chovy@tilde.club)
[12:05:12] <mrig> I am inside a parsers state machine, and have it running on a go routine, a channel out of the loop is serving tokens.
[12:05:41] <mrig> This is to stop the loop so as to reset the state of the parser cleanly.
[12:05:43] <ikke> Sounds like the design Rob Pike came up with for templates
[12:05:56] <mrig> Yes, this is inspired by his talk :)
[12:06:01] <ikke> But he did not use contexts (which did not exist yet)
[12:06:12] <mrig> Oh I see, right.
[12:06:34] *** Joins: Ergo^ (~ergo@91.238.59.144)
[12:06:45] <mrig> so this would be a sane way to stop the machine when not wanting to wait for a nil pointer?

[12:07:04] *** Joins: chovy (chovy@tilde.club)
[12:07:11] <ikke> Note that he later in the talk switched away from goroutines
[12:07:19] <mrig> seems apt here, I'm not yet that familiar with contexts, will put one in here and see how it goes.
[12:07:41] <mrig> Yes, I have tried both and benchmarked them.
[12:08:10] <mrig> with the routine, was much faster than without when running multiple short parses.
[12:08:22] <mrig> if not restarting the routine between services.
[12:09:00] <ikke> Didn't he use some kind of end of document token to denote there is nothing left to parse?
[12:09:14] <mrig> It is a very cool thing though to be able to switch the same implemention between concurrent and linear use.
[12:09:36] <mrig> Yes either an end point or an error.
[12:10:39] <mrig> Oh I see, right, I perhaps dont need this. It could be that I am thinking about it as a means to help the development of something that is my poor design.
[12:11:06] <mrig> Essentially I am looking to reset it to start it again with a new start state.
[12:11:46] <mrig> due to the nature of its position in my code, this lexer is receiving many small snippets rather than one single source.
[12:12:01] <mrig> those snippets have differing start states.
[12:12:07] <ikke> Maybe you can automatically reset once you reach the end of something?
[12:12:15] <ikke> so that it's ready for the next part
[12:12:31] <mrig> That would be more logical now that you mention.
[12:13:40] <mrig> right yes, I need to make the end of the snippet work before thinking about the rest.

[16:37:29] <bloony> "Valueeeeeeeeeee 1" in my example above
[16:40:00] <Sam> bloony: I'm missing the context with your example, but one of the examples from the fmt docs is basically this (it uses spaces, but of course you can just replace those with \t instead).
[16:40:23] <Sam> https://play.golang.org/p/YjSwuvzPUU7
[16:41:27] <bloony> https://play.golang.org/p/jS36QcNAtR9
[16:42:47] <bloony> So the s1 should should be "Valueeeeeeeeeeeee 1" and s2 should be Value2
[16:43:02] <bloony> -should
[16:43:15] <fizzie> bloony: https://play.golang.org/p/PMXHiqFTp8t
[16:44:05] <fizzie> Hmm, that didn't work either. I guess it's not the C scanf. :/
[16:44:18] <fizzie> Anyway: "Input processed by verbs is implicitly space-delimited: the implementation of every verb except %c starts by discarding leading spaces from the remaining input, and the %s verb (and %v reading into a string) stops consuming input at the first space or newline character."
[16:44:39] <fizzie> So no, you can't make %s scan a space. Probably a sign that Sscanf is not the function you want.

[16:56:53] <A_Dragon> `([^\t]\t?)+`
[16:57:45] <bloony> nice.. thats handy.. my regexp is rusty.. what function would I use in the regexp package?

[16:58:30] <A_Dragon> theres a good explanation in it
[16:59:02] <A_Dragon> though if you want to do it that way you... might want something like (?:^|\t)([^\t]) maybe
[16:59:22] <A_Dragon> or you could just split the string on tabs
[16:59:30] <A_Dragon> I just considered that -_-
[16:59:59] <bloony> ah.. ffs.. why didn't I think of that..
[17:00:03] <A_Dragon> :D

[17:47:52] <bloony> this wasn't easy.. I realize my output is sometimes formated with 2x\t .. I can also have empty value on one column of the tabwrite.. I don't think a regexp can help me here either.. because of the empty values.. Is there a way to get the actual outputed string without the tabs? Then I can parse the first line where the keys are and get the index position of where each keys start and use that on the value

[18:37:59] <dakotakae> Hey all, anyone have experience with the GoLang library for AWS Cognito? I'm running into a strange issue that is causing a lot of stress with my higher ups.
[18:38:29] <dakotakae> I'm not even really a developer, just a devops gal. I'm not great with Go, but the original dev on this module is long gone.
[18:38:43] <dakotakae> Basically, we
[18:40:20] <dakotakae> we've got a lambda running that checks availability on some schedules. Up until recently, it's been working without issue. On Friday, though, it started timing out for a lot of people. It's inconsistent and is working now, but wasn't working for about 10 hours yesterday. Nothing has changed in the code or environment for the last 4 months.
[18:40:28] *** Joins: michele_ (~eraser@user/michele)
[18:41:08] <dakotakae> The error we're seeing in Cloudwatch logs is that the CognitoJWT.go failed to fetch JSON from <url>/.well-known/jwks.json
[18:41:16] <siXy> dakotakae: have you asked aws support to check there's no problems with the service itself? Their service status page is famous for pretending everything is fine when it isn't.
[18:41:43] <dakotakae> However, if I open that path in the browser, pull it in through cURL, or anything else, the JSON renders just fine.
[18:42:11] <lazyreader> is that URL provided by cognito? or by one of your services?
[18:42:11] <dakotakae> No other module in our app that uses Cognito is facing this issue, which is why we're not thinking it's on the service side.
[18:42:37] <dakotakae> AFAIK, it's provided by our backend for the rest of the service.
[18:43:05] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@122.172.62.99)
[18:43:28] <lazyreader> but it's https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}/.well-known/jwks.json, or...
[18:45:00] <siXy> It's possible that there's some bug in your code that makes it more sensitive to problems with the service than it should be, but without seeing the code it's impossible to say. It's much more likely that something *has* changed and the person that changed it either forgot or didn't realise it would affect this also

[18:49:45] <dakotakae> It happened after we deployed an update to the backend, but from what we can see, this doesn't call any part of that component.
