[00:13:50] <mouseghost> someone here was acting not-nice towards me over the non-generic vs generic drug brands
[00:14:37] <mouseghost> and uhhh, we get a state discount on some drugs, so, it doesnt really matter when it comes to the price
[00:15:17] <imode> hwat
[00:15:33] <skyl4rk> here as in irc, or irl?
[00:16:06] <skyl4rk> what's a good client for irl by the way, I only have this meat thing and I'm not sure I'm using it right
[00:16:23] <imode> FleshPuppet 4.0 is coming out in the next three million years.
[00:16:44] <imode> though I don't know if it's a major or minor version bump.
[00:16:47] <imode> could use a few bugfixes.
[00:16:59] <imode> hope they backport 'em.
[00:18:07] <mouseghost> here as in this channel, skyl4rk
[00:18:40] <imode> how long ago lmao.

[00:30:18] <mouseghost> riv, indeed it does seem so
[00:30:46] <imode> yeah I doubt that the individual is still around. who cares that much about the difference between generic/non-generic...
[00:35:07] <riv> always nice to have you on mouseghost :)
[00:35:34] <mouseghost> wish to have logs rn hmm

[00:35:41] <mouseghost> thanks, likewise?
[00:36:23] <skyl4rk> dunno if I have logs that far back, but the drug brand might be a unique enough keyword

[00:42:35] <mouseghost> the keyword is "zoloft

[08:45:38] <imode> my head is caught in an analysis paralysis whirlwind.
[08:48:24] <imode> the dangerous part of playing with simple things is that at some point, the whole world is up for grabs.
[09:02:00] <dimadima> analysis paralysis is the worst
[09:02:56] <imode> there are two choices for a number encoding in FV3: fixed-length and variable length. the former bloats your code, the latter bloats your data.
[09:04:10] <imode> and there are multiple variable length encoding schemes.
[09:10:56] <indigo> Just use binary coded decimal and have your head explode
[09:12:12] <imode> I mean.. the variable length portions are essentially generalized BCD.
[09:12:33] <imode> you use some run of bits terminated by a 0 to represent a digit, and the number of 1s represents the magnitude of the digit.
[09:14:59] <dimadima> good night, good luck imode
[09:15:02] <imode> o/
[09:15:58] <imode> the problem is you also need to, say, encode things like markers to seek to them.
[09:17:27] <imode> so you could store some sort of fixed-length value ahead of whatever encoding you wanted to use for the number, and depending on that fixed-length value, you're looking at a marker, a number, etc.
[09:18:54] <imode> if you just need to differentiate between a marker and a number, you just read a bit before you do any operation. if the bit is 1, it's a number, if it's 0, it's a marker.
[09:22:02] <imode> no need to store any actual data for the marker, either, unless you want typed markers.

[17:48:58] <gthm> from docs at work about a db table column: "The value can either be a small number representing the period in half-hour increments (e.g. a value of 144 means 72 hours before check-in), or an epoch value specifying the exact date and time."
[17:49:36] <gthm> so now I wonder what the magic number we use to sniff at whether a value is a half-hour increment or an epoch is
[17:50:37] <companion_cube> I  guess you can look at the epoch for 2000-ish and compare to it? it's already a pretty high number I think
[17:51:08] <gthm> yeah probably. for reasons to do with reality any epoch would also have to be >= current_epoch
[17:51:39] <gthm> it's just funny what people do to database columns

[19:43:21] <riv> you have to write something just to throw it away <-- can you tell me a bit about taht?
[19:48:15] <indigo> I think you can boil it down to "no one ever gets it right on the first try"
[19:48:33] <indigo> Since while you're building something for the first time, you learn more about the problem domain
[19:49:03] <indigo> But there is also a caveat to not over-engineer the second system that you build
