[01:09:08] <technomancy> does anyone work at a company that has programmers people on staff whose job specifically revolves around training the more junior programmers?
[01:12:20] <varjag> like, specific training on the products?
[01:12:50] <technomancy> no, more like programming languages and distributed systems topics
[01:13:09] <varjag> that sounds like what your school should have done
[01:13:18] <varjag> or bootcamp or whatever
[01:13:23] <technomancy> bootcamps are useless
[01:13:31] <technomancy> and schools are 90% useless
[01:13:40] <c355e3b> Two jobs ago we did
[01:13:44] <c355e3b> s/we/i/
[01:13:48] <technomancy> but I guess it's uncommon to have a company as big as mine that uses a language you can't hire for =)
[01:14:03] <daegalus> languages is your own time or school. distributed system is experience. Staff and Senior engineers mentor junior engineers through helping with process, learning systems, etc. But its not direct
[01:14:09] <leah2> which language?
[01:14:18] <varjag> training on the job is common, just that dedicated staff for that sounds wasteful
[01:14:19] <technomancy> leah2: clojure
[01:14:30] <leah2> i got a job :p
[01:14:34] <technomancy> varjag: we're hiring a ton. (more than is wise honestly)

[01:15:04] *** Joins: TheAceOfHearts (~TheAceOfH@24.41.239.76)
[01:15:27] <varjag> technomancy: then you basically end up running a bootcamp
[01:15:29] <c355e3b> Generally fine, the person who they had running it was a really nice former SRE type
[01:15:31] <varjag> which as you say useless
[01:15:40] <c355e3b> By the time they were out, they got how to move around the codebase w/o breaking stuff
[01:15:44] <technomancy> varjag: no, I mean market forces make existing bootcamps useless
[01:15:49] <technomancy> the idea itself isn't inherently worthless
[01:15:55] <c355e3b> IMO the bigger issue is that I would want something like that for Staff/Arch types
[01:16:02] <c355e3b> to keep them the fuck away from the AWS cocaine basket
[01:16:44] <varjag> technomancy: if someone needs dedicated staff to learn themselves closure you've mishired imo
[01:17:20] <varjag> some assistance could help but good ones should start swimming early
[01:17:31] <daegalus> the higher up the food chain, the more designy/mentory you get. You goal is to mentor and help bring new design and efforts tot the company. Usuually, Staff/Principal/Architect, etc.
[01:17:40] <varjag> s/closure/clojure dammit
[01:18:16] <imode> there's rarely any mentorship for base concepts.
[01:18:21] <technomancy> varjag: oh yeah, I agree. the rate of hiring is not healthy.
[01:18:31] <imode> we ain't payin ye to learn the basics.
[01:18:43] <imode> you need to go into debt for that. monetary or social.

[01:19:39] <imode> uhhhh.
[01:19:41] <imode> no.
[01:19:42] <daegalus> thats, horrible. I understand explaining how to use basics in more advanced context or applications, but not hte basic itself
[01:19:43] <imode> no they are not.
[01:19:56] <daegalus> sounds like they need a link to freecodecamp
[01:19:58] <imode> daegalus: you'll be horrified to learn that I work at a FAANG.
[01:20:11] <daegalus> wait, wtf?
[01:20:13] <demize> In $PREVIOUSTEAM we had multiple "developers" that just.. couldn't write even halfway decent code, and had neither reading nor hearing comprehension.  :/
[01:20:14] <imode> yeah.
[01:20:27] <daegalus> here I am trying to get into a FAANG and their stupid interviews, and people like that get in?
[01:20:35] <demize> One of them freshly graduated from University.  :p
[01:20:38] <varjag> technomancy: something like three day intense course into the language could be helpful to gear up
[01:20:49] <imode> daegalus: I don't have a degree and I'm an L5 at Amazon.
[01:20:50] <varjag> but if it's more like a month it's cheaper to fire right away
[01:20:55] <imode> so.
[01:21:02] <imode> you do you.
[01:21:28] <daegalus> im a staff at unity with no degree also, FAANG interviews are just sooooo leetcodey
[01:21:59] <imode> if you're willing to take the low end of comp you can ascend the tree pretty easily.
[01:22:14] <technomancy> on my own team I spend a lot of time pairing with junior devs, and it's super helpful. they know the basics of the language but they aren't fluent with idioms.

[01:24:08] <daegalus> ya, Unity is going hybrid by default. 3 home, 2 office, you can request full office of full WFH  though. so its super flexible.
[01:24:29] <technomancy> varjag: I have a really hard time getting motivated when it's like "the company needs X" or "we need to make the line go up" (yawn) but when it's like "this person I work with wants to gain a better mastery of their craft", hell yeah I can get behind that

[01:31:44] <imode> ah no wonder.
[01:32:07] <imode> I'm a lowly L5.
[01:32:19] <dasm> and, btw, counting tc, based on stocks appreciation is kinda... like looking into crystal ball: you might get it, and you might not.
[01:32:23] <imode> a step below senior.

[01:34:15] <dasm> imode: if you look at intel, where stocks went sideways for last 3-4 years... and a year ago they dropped really significantly. it would mean: someone could say, my tc is 100% but next year it was immediately 75-80%

[01:34:29] <imode> dasm: yeah equity is the weak way out of paying people.
[01:34:45] <imode> hence why a majority of my comp is in equity. :')
[01:35:08] <imode> plus if you're smart you can play markets and make up the extra gap between you and a senior role.
[01:35:13] <dsc_> NL is a country where you can make "a decent living" working till you are old, it is difficult to get fired by your employer. But the flipside of that coin is that if you are motivated and/or any good at your job, it is almost impossible to reap the benefits from that. High income is taxed into oblivion.

[01:40:06] <imode> daegalus: I'm surprised they're completing it at the rate that they are.
[01:40:11] <manicennui> The US is great for those on top, and pretty damn good for those of us just below them.
[01:40:19] <technomancy> I just hate the idea of having to work for a tech company or lose functioning healthcare
[01:40:22] <manicennui> But I don't know whether our quality of life is actually that might higher.
[01:40:25] <manicennui> If at all.
[01:40:52] <manicennui> Not just lose healthcare, but the moment you actually *use* your health insurance, you end up putting out thousands pretty easily.
[01:41:04] <manicennui> Anything much beyond basic checkups and really simple procedures/drugs.
[01:41:19] <imode> yeah fuck the US.
[01:41:24] <dsc_> So my point was that if you are some hot shot 20 years experience 10x rockstar VIM user who dreams in MIPS code and wrote his own compiler at the age of 8, my country is not the place to be for 1) compenstation 2) taxes 3) seeking VC funding

[01:49:16] <daegalus> yes. Most of the devops is building foundational automation and tooling for other teams at unity. we are the core Devops/Infrastructure team. We build directly ontop of GCP, AWS, etc and provide the self-service tooling an automation for other teams to use. We effectively standardize process through tools. So we manage things like Cloudbees, Monitoring with Grafana/Prometheus/Thanos, project
[01:49:18] <daegalus> creation, kubernetes automation/helm charts, vault and managing the secrets/groups inside, and many other things. We manage the tools that lets everyone else do their job easier at unity

[01:51:10] <daegalus> we terraform our GKE clusters, we have lots of terraform and terraform modules
[01:51:30] <imode> GKE being "sane" makes sense because... I mean look at the major backer.
[01:51:58] <c355e3b> dont at me but the best k8s is nomad
[01:52:29] <daegalus> when we moved AWS to GKE, EKS didnt exist, we ran our own K8s clusters from scratch, it was such a breath of fresh air at the time and its getting better all the time
[01:52:57] <daegalus> I agree, Nomad is great. I wish there was more community around Nomad. Or something like helmcharts or public manifests people share for common tools.
[01:52:58] <imode> yeah don't move back to AWS.
[01:53:06] <c355e3b> I will say the once nice part about k8s is that is enables me to write a bunch of really strange shit
[01:53:10] <daegalus> we dont plan to. Google is taking really nice care of us
[01:53:13] <tmichel> last time I looked at nomad it had a few usability shortcomings but all the integration with the hashi stack is really nice.
[01:53:38] <c355e3b> i'm at the point where I can get full observability on any process which loosely follows Beej's networking guide w/o modification
[01:54:35] <daegalus> TF, Vault, Packer, Consul, etc are all used here. Nomad was even at one point, but we couldn't get internal buy-in, so it was removed. Boundary looks real nice too

[01:55:02] <c355e3b> Boundary is kinda shit compared to Teleport though
[01:55:53] <c355e3b> There is a large group of non dev users who I could get through Teleport, but I know Boundary's UX would kill them

[06:02:41] <pushcx> cb: Yeah, I asked for it so it's visible in the logs.
[06:02:45] <twodayslate> yes I believe that is doable
[06:02:53] <cb> twodayslate: honestly i actually didnt know there was a lobsters iOS app. i might actually try this myself once it's ready
[06:03:16] <cb> the mobile site works fine but hey, i paid over a thousand loonies for the privilege of NSSeafood
[06:03:37] <twodayslate> I have posted in this chat before about it . It isn't to my liking 100% yet so I haven't posted to the site itself. It's the best way for me to learn SwiftUI
[06:03:47] <cb> i've been meaning to learn swift
[06:03:54] <feoh> Yeah I'll definitely give it a whirl as well. Safari is my least favorite part of the IOS ecosystem :)
[06:03:56] <cb> i know some remedial objc, enough to hack on an app i use on mac
[06:04:00] <Xe> it's a nice lang, kinda odd but it works
[06:04:14] <cb> so having a real-world example app would actually be useful for study
[06:04:19] <cb> esp since i know the lobsters API
[06:04:28] <pushcx> twodayslate: We've had a number of people tinker with Android and iOS clients over the years. Almost all of them have been college students practicing with a hobby project, so I assumed your questions were along those same lines.
[06:04:32] <Xe> i hate dealing with the apple signing circlejerk though or i'd use it more
[06:04:39] <twodayslate> I apologize if the name seemed shady. I actually got positive feedback in this chat cause it *did* look like the official site. lol
[06:05:26] <pushcx> I appreciate that the name and logo aren't "Lobsters" and our favicon.
[06:05:40] <cb> if i named an app, i'd go for "Shrimping Vessel"
[06:05:43] <twodayslate> @pushcx that is an alternative icon - I can remove if you want
[06:06:50] <pushcx> twodayslate: Oh, please do.
[06:07:05] <twodayslate> Okay

[06:08:21] <feoh> There's a guy in my lodge who's a trademark lawyer for MIT. He says that easily 90% of his work is talking to people who have NO IDEA they're violating the law and think they're using the school's trademark in a friendly and non damage causing way. Communication is impossible, but necessary, chapter 9000 :)

[06:18:36] <twodayslate> yep. Didn't really think about setting my own version up
[06:19:45] <pushcx> There's instructions in the readme, and we answer setup questions here. It shouldn't be too terribly many steps after 'brew install ruby mariadb'.

[22:44:58] <pushcx> Is there a succinct term for when a program gets stuck in a loop, pinning a CPU rather than crashing?
[22:45:08] <Church> There is...
[22:45:15] <Church> Now if only I could recall it
[22:45:58] <vito> livelock? as opposed to deadlock
[22:48:51] <dsc_> when you say stuck, is it still cycling through iterations or really stuck?
[22:51:10] <meff[m]> livelock is the closest term I'm familiar with
[22:54:32] <ngoldbaum> infinite loop?
[22:54:55] <bkero> spinning
[22:55:01] <imode> you can pin the CPU with a deadlock too.
[22:56:08] <pushcx> dsc_: stuck, will never exit
[22:56:29] <imode> pushcx: "hung"?
[22:56:37] <imode> "the program's hanging".

[22:56:56] <pushcx> imode: Does hung imply pinning a CPU to you? I don't get that from it, but I guess I've never thought about it.
[22:57:17] <imode> means that it's gone unresponsive, I think pinning is a secondary trait to a hung program.
[22:57:31] <imode> I don't think it's a specific term.
[22:57:47] <imode> spinning is probably a good one.
[22:57:53] <ngoldbaum> hung just means the ui thread never gets called for some reason
[22:58:11] <ngoldbaum> could be because of CPU pinning in a loop but could be other reasons
[22:58:16] <companion_cube> pushcx: fire hazard
[22:58:52] <bkero> It means you didn't write enough async node.js code

[23:09:05] <feoh> pushcx: I honestly think 'hung' is right, because the nature of hanging does not IMO imply a total standstill. How many times have you run strace/ptrace/struss on a process that seemed hunt and find it endlessly spin waiting on a select() or poll() ? :)
