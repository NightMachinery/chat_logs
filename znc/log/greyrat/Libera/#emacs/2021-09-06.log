[00:17:21] <parsnip> there are notmuch people here :)
[00:17:32] <kenran> I probably screwed up my multi-account setup, something with sender address or something. I'm pretty sure it'd be fine now. But I'll never really know what I like best before having tried gnus, too :D

[00:26:12] <kenran> in most cases that suffices so you don't have to learn much about many tools but have to understand cryptip nix errors sometimes as a tradeoff. if you have problems with the configs, ofc you still have to dig and that's where it gets ugly

[00:28:10] <fsbot> parsnips-incremental-mail-setup: If you want to get started using mail in Emacs sooner, you could try Gnus and nnimap, I used it for a few years. but I guess nowadays mu4e/notmuch are more popular. I would recommend setting up mutt while you test the pieces that combine towards mu4e/notmuch. You can even start using mutt right away with imap. then maybe next configure msmtp, then later, mbsync or
[00:29:04] <kenran> say I move a thread of emails to another folder, then another mail that would belong to that thread comes in. if I now move that one to the same folder the rest is in, will that "reconnect" somehow?

[01:05:40] <wgreenhouse> twb: the burden of interoperation in a server federation where most of the behavior is no longer explicitly specified by standards is always going to be thus.

[02:08:09] <TRS-80> twb: Not according to wgreenhouse above testimony, in fact almost the opposite
[02:09:15] <wgreenhouse> I'd agree with twb inasmuch as if you want to deal with maintaining a local cache, use local dovecot, not nnmaildir--because a real imap server is much smarter about caching and indexing than nnmaildir
[02:09:35] <wgreenhouse> but for me at least maintaining a local cache has not been worth it lately
[02:09:49] <twb> Note that if you do use dovecot, and only dovecot, to access the mailbox, you should ABSOLUTELY look at mdbox on-disk format
[02:09:56] <TRS-80> that is so relieving to hear, I was dreading setting all this crap up, lol
[02:09:59] <twb> This stores attachments in 30% less space, and indexes faster.
[02:10:18] <twb> You should also consider fts-xapian, unless dovecot has finished in-housing their own xapian FTS
[02:10:23] * TRS-80 has also read more than a fair amount into Dovecot over the years (FWIW)

[04:37:52] <grym> probably lapsed
[04:38:11] <twb> In 1895, Bayer marketed diacetylmorphine as an over-the-counter drug under the trademark name Heroin.^[88]

[05:33:53] <parsnip> > By adding a large stuff sack, this turned the Air Pannier into a normal saddle bag, but without the fear of leaving a nice set of panniers on my bike whilst leaving it locked up in a busy city centre for hours at a time. We also managed to put a pair of conga drums in them. I found the Air Pannier to be a really great, lightweight, theft and stress free way to carry big stuff on my bike.
[05:34:30] <parsnip> you can't stuff a normal pannier in your backpack

[09:02:15] <parsnip> > U.S. export controls only allowed the sale of encryption products overseas if their key length was below 40 bits, effectively ensuring that the U.S. National Security Agency could break into them if required.

[11:37:47] <dre> focus on being healthy is the main thing, and look at intermittent fasting imo. basically "skipping breakfast, having late lunch" will do far far better in terms of actually removing fat from your body. 
[11:38:14] <dre> but everything is a process. get into healthy habits, learn to appreciate discomfort, etc. 
[11:39:33] <parsnip> i think when your stomach "feels" empty or full, that's signals from your brain or w/e
[11:39:58] <parsnip> so i just try to not eat to "full" as often, and i try to wait until i "feel" hungry but not too hungry
[11:40:57] <parsnip> one tricky thing i have to mix into that, is i like to make sure i'm well fed if i'm i know i have to do a bunch of physical work, not a good feeling to get halfway through that and go dumb
[11:40:59] <dre> yeah, that can help, but it's also psychological. our bodies are wired to survive, not to "be successful" 
[11:41:29] <dre> so like, if you look or smell something nuriently rich, your brain will be like "damn I'm hungry" - irregardless of how much you actually have in your stomach.

[11:43:12] <parsnip> i haven't really gotten into deliberate fasting. i figure eating small snacks is similar effect
[11:43:55] <dre> actually not, it's like a "ketosis" cycle, where your body will change gears through different modes after it has had no input.
[11:44:07] <parsnip> right i think ultraprocessed foods don't trigger the "full" feeling correctly
[11:44:27] <dre> so like, eating small snacks just tricks your body into "keep going onto the next one" -- where as, if you fast ( which you do mainly while sleeping) - your body goes into a different processing state. 
[11:44:33] <parsnip> "zero fiber carbs with added flavors? MORE"
[11:44:41] <dre> yeah exactly.

[11:47:44] <dre> yeah that's a good idea, Doctor will help 
[11:47:57] <dre> or just weight loss in general perhaps
[11:48:22] <dre> fasting is only for a small time, like 16 hours, which is a little longer than when you're sleeping

[11:49:45] <dre> yeah exactly, it's not a big deal. when you do that, there's certain modes that yuour body will get into

[11:50:13] *** Quits: michzapp` (~user@144.121.6.144) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[11:50:42] <dre> nope, Because you could eat a small amount of calories continually, and your body would always have a slight amount of calories in it's "ram" (so to speak, this is a nerd channel after all) 
[11:50:43] <parsnip> often my breakfast is just, half coffee, half milk. i guess milk has calories
[11:50:50] <dre> milk does it 
[11:50:52] <dre> yep
[11:51:06] <dre> I got onto black coffee, really helps to feel the effects.
[11:51:27] <dre> but anyway, yeah, i dunno, try it, talk to doctor, and most of all Good luck! 
[11:51:32] <parsnip> then why do people emphasize "caloric deficit" as the bottom line?
[11:51:53] <dre> because it's easy to sell and understand, and people love to argue
[11:52:21] <parsnip> > A study has investigated how intermittent fasting compares with calorie restriction to reduce weight. 
[11:52:27] <dre> and take the simple route out* i guess 
[11:52:32] <parsnip> > The results suggest that intermittent fasting is no better than calorie restriction for weight loss and is actually less effective in reducing body fat content.

[11:56:48] <parsnip> and so my simple attempts are, "don't eat as much at a sitting as you used to", and "don't eat until you're a little bit hungry"
[11:57:19] <dre> I think perhaps eating at regular intervals and having water helps 
[11:57:29] <parsnip> except, "maybe eat enough when you anticipate lots of activity with food not as conveniently at hand"
[11:57:31] <dre> one big thing for me was to have a 2Lt bottle of water next to the computer

[11:57:38] <dre> that blew my mind lol

[23:36:23] <pkal> dminuoso: I might have been a bit too young when I heard about it the first time, but I was enthusiastic when thinking that you could provide payment without cooperating with a bank or payment service
[23:36:32] <dminuoso> johnjay: As a very random example: Consider that bitcoin is struggling at 5tx/s currently. VISA *alone* makes over 20,000tx/s.

[23:38:48] <johnjay> the problem is they've basically ticked off every other country and state where they could use huge amounts of electricity
[23:39:13] <johnjay> so once texas grid gets tired of blackouts and whatever they'll be gone from there too

[23:40:55] <dminuoso> johnjay: Indeed. :-)
[23:41:00] <pkal> johnjay: "no miners = no crypto" Not necessarily though, I think bitcoin can operate at any number of miners, the issue is that there is no improvment with more miners
[23:41:20] <pkal> (for some value of "any number")
[23:41:21] <johnjay> the miners process transactions as part of the design
[23:41:25] <dminuoso> Once bitcoins are mined, transaction fees will sky rocket and the bitcoin prices will plumet.
[23:41:28] <johnjay> so without miners nothing happens. is that wrong?
[23:41:33] <dminuoso> And the ponzi scheme is completely blown up
[23:41:37] <dminuoso> johnjay: no.
[23:41:41] <dminuoso> well yes, its wrong
[23:41:50] <dminuoso> the motivation for signing transactions will just be fees then
[23:41:56] <dminuoso> even right now its both
[23:42:28] <dminuoso> which means tx fees will skyrocket, which in turn means payments will become crazy expensive - even more than they already are.

[23:47:33] <johnjay> well it isn't. you can't predict bernie madoff is a ponzi scheme until he starts promsiing returns that aren't possible
[23:48:02] <pkal> I don't think it had to be a ponzi scheme, it just turned out to be one. The hope was that by the time no new coins are mined, bitcoin would be widespread enough for low fees to suffice as motivation for mining. Not sure if it would have worked in the end, but it doesn't seem impossible.
[23:48:02] <johnjay> that's what happened. someone wrote a book showing how his returns were mathematically impossible. and now we've reached that point with bitcoin.

[23:48:35] <dminuoso> pkal: 21:06:32         dminuoso | johnjay: As a very random example: Consider that bitcoin is struggling at 5tx/s currently. VISA *alone* makes over 20,000tx/s.
[23:48:45] <dminuoso> pkal: It doesn't even *remotely* scale in the slightest.

[23:48:49] <pkal> The main problem remains energy usage, and the fact that there is no upper bound to mining.
[23:49:31] <dminuoso> Your average large supermarket has more tx/s than the entirety of global bitcoin.
[23:49:45] <dminuoso> And that's not an adoption problem

[23:50:08] <parsnip> dminuoso: is there a webpage or link somewhere that summarizes these negative issues?
[23:50:09] <pkal> dminuoso: Yes, but from what I remember, the network adapts to the number of miners, so it shouldn't inherently matter if they decrease.
[23:51:06] <pkal> I mean it has practical issues too. I remember wanting to pay with bitcoin in some shop once, and it took too long to confirm the transaction so I just used cash instead
[23:51:08] <dminuoso> pkal: block time is 10 minutes.
[23:51:13] <dminuoso> pkal: There you have it.
[23:52:07] <dminuoso> pkal: Well, you can get transactions confirmed quicker if you pay more tx fees.. maybe.
