[21:49:42] <highplainsdruid> hi everyone.  i had a nice and working smtpd.conf for just my own domain.  had only one local account, and mail went to ~/Maildir
[21:49:51] <highplainsdruid> then i went to add virtual domains, i got it mostly working, except aliases
[21:50:06] <highplainsdruid> aliases on my original domain claim to be delivered but never show up in the inbox
[21:50:13] <highplainsdruid> https://batteen.com/smtpd.conf.txt
[21:51:09] <highplainsdruid> i couldn't figure out a way to have dovecot look in different places for them maildir depending on the domain of the authenticating user, so i moved mails from ~/Maildir to /var/mail/batteen.com/%user/Maildir and i have to wonder if that didn't have an effect
[21:51:38] <highplainsdruid> then i can have my new domain's emails at /var/mail/bd.net/%user/Maildir   (new domain has been sanitized, is not actually bd.net)
[21:54:25] <highplainsdruid> actually it gave a 451 error this time.  https://batteen.com/smtpdlog.txt
[21:55:36] <highplainsdruid> other times it's claimed to deliver succesfully.  i have not modified the aliases file
[22:03:31] *** Quits: vortexx (~nothing@user/vortexx) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:05:57] <highplainsdruid> it just delivered on the second attempt, i have updated the log file at https://batteen.com/smtpdlog.txt
[22:06:06] <highplainsdruid> "delivered" but it's not in the inbox

[22:29:44] <highplainsdruid> i have found where they are being delivered, to /var/mail/batteen.com/<alias>/Maildir instead of to /var/mail/batteen.com/john/Maildir as they are supposed to
[22:29:53] <highplainsdruid> even though the log file says it has found the address in aliases
[22:38:19] <leah2> use ${dest.user} ?

[23:17:53] <opv> good evening everyone. i've got `tls-require` on my submission port, but thunderbird still auto-detects port 587 with no encryption.
[23:18:10] <opv> is this a client-side error, or is there some autodetect helper setting i'm missing?
