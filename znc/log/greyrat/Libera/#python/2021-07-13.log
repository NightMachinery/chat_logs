[03:51:55] <bjs> Yhg1s: I'm not sure the fact Python did it makes it any better ;)
[03:52:14] <bjs> I think the docs need updating to say... what it actually does better?

[03:52:51] <Yhg1s> bjs: the decision to make indexing of bytes work the way it works -- and how it works differently from other strings -- was clearly a mistake.
[03:54:00] <bjs> Yhg1s: I'm not defending these decisions;  I would much have preferred the stringy-ness of bytes objects to have been killed in totality in Python 3 and for bytes to natively support more numeric operations like & and ^.

[05:02:32] <InPhase> dre: Never rely on just dates for temporary files.  That's a security risk.
[05:02:38] <ssbr_> or I think there's a function in the os module or similar that NamedTemporaryFile uses, which has a big security warning next to it.
[05:03:04] <JordiGH> dre: Datestamps aren't low-res enough? I think I could get two files at the same instant?

[07:22:11] <sybariten> then i redesign the script so that most of the functionality is in an external module servant.py that i import. Now, there is a function in servant.py thats called showBasket() and it does print(basket) and print(len(basket)) ....   well, i mean, this doesnt seem to work.

[09:16:30] <BrenBarn> it's more that you can return only one value, but that value can be a container that contains multiple values
[09:16:39] <BrenBarn> so if you do `return var1, var2`, what you returned is a tuple with two things inside it

[16:20:49] <nubonix_> whats the best way to turn a windows computer into a slave? not sure a better way to put it
[16:21:29] <Julian> nubonix_: Probably better for #windows.
[16:21:31] <Wulf> nubonix_: connect it directly to the internet and surf the web with an old MSIE version.
[16:21:59] <nubonix_> an example of what im trying to build is here https://eternalfarm.net/

[16:22:37] <nubonix_> lemme explain a bit more on what im trying to do
[16:23:02] <Wulf> nubonix_: also explain how this is related to python.
[16:23:06] <supakeen> Not that historically, one time pads weren't in very wide spread use due to the difficulty of moving keys around and using a pad multiple times being such an information leak :)
[16:23:06] <nubonix_> so i have pairs of one .exe per one .jar, each .jar control the exe and i need to isolate each pair

[16:23:40] <nubonix_> the way im currently doing it is with rpyc, but i think that a http restful api might be easier, but im not sure
[16:24:19] <nubonix_> id like to automate the installation of a few programs, and ive written the installers for them using pywinauto
[16:24:35] <nubonix_> the problem im having with one of the installers is the uac
[16:24:43] <asa22> supakeen all pictures one can find of them wether from russians or CIA or whatever are in that format, and I've heard from multiple sources thats like an established thing to put them in columns of 5 like that
[16:24:50] <asa22> like old pictures I mean
[16:25:04] <nubonix_> i can use winpwnage to get around the uac, but its not really reliable, so was thinking there might be a better way [as i have admin rights for the other computers]

[16:50:28] <nubonix_> Confusioned: im not sure if you are distributing your workload or if you are asking why its using 2/4 2/6 cores [e.g.], could also be a default setting by tensorflow to not bog the computer down so that you can still do other things on while its doing its thing
[16:50:50] <con3> However it seems to be happening a lot slower than 25 milliseconds.. Like orders of magnitude slower

[16:52:52] <wakeup> yes, itertools is probably the key
[16:52:54] <nubonix_> Confusioned: could be if its hardcoded to use something like 2 cores no matter how many cores are available on the machine
