[00:04:13] <Led_Zeppelin2> using centos

[00:08:12] <tabakhase> works fine here
[00:08:54] <tabakhase> inc doing it over bash - so check whatever $img is is actually what you think it to be i guess...
[00:10:28] <Led_Zeppelin2> my ENTRYPOINT was whacked
[00:10:32] <tabakhase> debian baseimage for example is missing "uptime" command, but after adding it it works just fine too -> docker run --rm debian bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install procps -y && uptime"

[01:31:27] <tabakhase> "provides a virtual system" is almost a bit of a mouthfull... - both uses the os base think hyperkit on mac & hyperV on win -- setting this up yourself is rly just a "create vm" command
[01:32:23] <tabakhase> the only "fancy" docker-desktop rly brings is a proxy on your host, so you can hit 127.0.0.1 or such, instead of say, 192.168.99.1 (when using virtualbox via old docker-toolbox for example)
[01:32:26] <physikoi_> Are .env file values just for augmenting docker-compose and Dockerfile? I had thought they would be forwarded to the container environment, but that seems to be wrong

[01:56:57] <tabakhase> that automagically, if it hasnt already - or someone will fork docker-toolbox (stuck on virtualbox&docker19, but its apache-license so lifting that to hyperV&docker20 shouldnt be that big of a deal... :P)

[02:06:12] <zoredache> I looking for an opinions about one of the true hard problems (naming).  What are people naming their collection, when the collection really just has one role, and module. I am trying to build a collection that I can share that will manage a package 'foo' and use 'foo' to do things. The obvious name for the module is 'foo', which would make the fully qualified `zoredache.foo.foo`. It feels like the foo.foo will be confusing.

[16:37:46] <RV06> luva, if it shows with "docker images" they are images, not containers.
[16:38:46] <minimal> luva: if you have build a docker image several times using the same name and tag then these will be the previous builds of those images
[16:39:01] <RV06> ...they are intermediate images, for which you don't know the name/tag. ie a Dockerfile "FROM debian:11" will download debian:11 image but won't tag it.
[16:39:48] <luva> yeah sorry, I know its images :)
[16:40:03] <RV06> or as said minimal, but I think these ones would not require "-a" to show.
[16:40:16] <luva> Well I I think its what you say RV06
[16:40:25] <luva> just problem is I cant delete them since they have dependant child images

[16:46:20] <RV06> Here is an article with details: https://dzone.com/articles/docker-layers-explained
[16:48:19] <luva> That is understandable, but I have 4 images with 777MB that I actually use and then there are 10 images without name tag

[16:51:06] <RV06> if "myapp" depends on "flask" which depends on "python" which depends on "debian" I'll have 3 noname images for 1 final image. And that's not a problem as they share their data, so it's not actually 4x 777MB.

[17:24:39] <minimal> luva: basically you cannot have more than 1 image with the same name, so if you either build an image more than once or if you "pull" a image more than once the older "versions" of the same instance have their "tag" set to "none", i.e. if you were to run the command "docker pull debian:latest" 3 times then you would end up will 1 image tagged "debian:latest" and 2 other images tagged "none"

[17:28:50] <minimal> if after the 1st pull of "debian:latest" you built a different container whose dockerfile said "FROM debian:latest" then that container would depend on that image. That container would depend on that *exact* image, and so you could not delete that exact image as it is being used by your container - you would have to rebuild your container for the new version of your container to depend on any newer version of the "debian:latest" image (at which poiint 
[17:28:50] <minimal> then you could delete the older image if no other containers depend on it)

[17:46:16] <dostoyevsky2> if your image is always called foo then it's easy to start from scripts, etc
[17:47:59] <minimal> if you want to start your container you decide which image to use - the image doesn't have to be the latest/newest one, you can use any existing version of the image. If you are referring to "latest" as the tag version, i.e. debian:latest, well I don't ever use "latest" exactly as it is an known quantity, I would use "debian:10" or "debian:11"

[19:39:39] <betuxy> Hey guys, I'm reading through the dockerfile man page and have trouble understanding the VOLUME directive, e.g. if I specify VOLUME ["/etc/cron"] does the etc/cron from the host system is mounted in the vm directory /etc/cron ?

[19:44:01] <ada_> betuxy: no, the VOLUME instruction in a Dockerfile has two use cases; first, it indicates to the end user that this is a location where _they_ should probably mount their own volume
[19:44:27] <ada_> betuxy: second, when you do go to run the image that it produces, docker will automatically mount an "anonymous" volume if the end user doesn't bring their own
[19:44:47] <ada_> betuxy: it doesn't use the host /etc/cron unless the end user does something like "docker run -v /etc/cron:/etc/cron"
[19:45:05] <ada_> the end user could specify a named volume, too, or they could just let docker create an anonymous volume
[19:45:29] *** Joins: midnite (~human@user/midnightlantern)
[19:45:46] <betuxy> ada: ah okay thanks, yeah i wanted to avoid a bind mount, is the volume to be specified in a compose file outside of the dockerfile then?
[19:46:03] <ada_> yes, the compose file volumes key sets the mounts that the container will get at runtime
[19:47:00] <betuxy> okay thanks :)
[19:48:43] *** Joins: physikoi (~physikoi@user/physikoi)
[19:49:35] <programmerq> the VOLUME instruction is the way that an image author will signal to whoever will use that image that a given location will be written to by the containerized software. "hey, this /var/lib/mysql location should be a volume of some sort no matter what because the container write layer isn't appropriate to store that kind of data here" or "/usr/share/nginx/caches should also not go on the write
[19:49:37] <programmerq> layer because tons of small files will take a performance hit in the write layer"
[19:52:41] <betuxy> are there guidelines on what should be best kept outside of a container, like the examples you gave?
[19:53:09] <ada_> in general, if your container writes files to disk, whatever location it uses to write in should probably be a volume
[19:53:16] <programmerq> persistent data that should stick around beyond the lifetime of a container (database data, uploaded files, etc)
[19:53:40] *** Quits: AzR4m (~AzRaM@lfbn-ren-1-12-235.w83-205.abo.wanadoo.fr) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:53:48] <programmerq> non-durable caching like my nginx cache example-- you can get better performance out of XFS than overlayfs+xfs
[19:54:22] <programmerq> usually you want the code itself to be in the container's filesystem, and then the data it works with to be in volumes.
[19:56:14] <programmerq> exceptions like wordpress do exist-- the official wordpress image puts the entire wordpress codebase into a volume. This is because the wordpress code is also part of its stateful data-- themes and plugins are indeed like code, but can be swapped out in the middle of runtime, so it's a weird paradigm. There are folks who run wordpress that disable the in-admin-interface plugin/theme changing and
[19:56:16] <programmerq> instead deal with those in their own custom Dockerfile. But the "native" wordpress experience basically means you need to treat the code as state, so that means volume in docker world.

[22:21:55] <physikoi> I have a mount bind like this defined in a docker-compose.yml: ./:/var/www/files/. There's some weird stuff going on. Like, if I edit files on host, they don't update in container; however, if I edit the same file in container, they'll update on the host. If i create a new file on host (EG `touch ./newfile`), it doesn't get listed when I `ls -la` from container. However, if I `ls -la ./newfile` in 
[22:21:56] <physikoi> container, the file info is shown. With all that said, once in a blue moon, a file edit made on host will reflect on container, but seems to be very rare. What could be going on here?? thanks
[22:24:59] <programmerq> physikoi▸ it sounds like you might have some sort of file sharing mechanism in play. What is your docker host and how did you install docker? Is this docker desktop on windows/mac?
[22:26:20] <physikoi> hi programmerq , i'm on macos using Docker Desktop with docker-compose (version < 2)
[22:27:13] <physikoi> Originally, I wasn't able to mount any of my files and there wasn't an error message. To fix that, I had to manually add parent folder to shared folders list in docker desktop's settings
