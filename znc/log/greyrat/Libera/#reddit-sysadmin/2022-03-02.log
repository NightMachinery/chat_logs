[03:20:13] <Cl0udNinja> btw... for anyone following along earlier / last night about my shit taking a goddamn decade to complete... it now takes 5 seconds because you can '<string> * <number> and make the string repeat number times..
[03:20:33] <Cl0udNinja> I fucking hate python sometimes
[03:20:43] <Cl0udNinja> ^ isnt exponent, you can multiply strings..
[03:20:57] <kerat58> whatcha makin' in Python, ninja?

[03:21:40] <kerat58> noice
[03:21:44] <Cl0udNinja> binary of a filesystem* rather
[03:22:37] <Cl0udNinja> has to fill some portions with empty bytes for things to line up properly, and I was using some while loop, but it was taking for goddamn ever

[03:23:49] <kerat58> what was slow about the old method?  do we know?
[03:25:05] <Cl0udNinja> I'm gonna assume probably some dumb python thing regarding allocation. like, string of size N exists, but now it needs to be N+1, so reallocate memory for N+1, write the byte, rinse and repeat where as string * (N+1) seems to pre-allocate N+1 memory and then just fill it
[03:25:08] <Cl0udNinja> thats my guess anyway
[03:25:22] <kerat58> which would then be 16 million times

[03:47:56] *** Quits: Fossil (~Fossil@2a03:b0c0:0:1010::398:b001) (Quit: Bye)
[03:48:30] <kerat58> The cost of living in Seattle, WA is 35.3% higher than in Atlanta, GA. You would have to earn a salary of $81,181 to maintain your current standard of living.Employers in Seattle, WA typically pay 10.5% more than employeers in Atlanta, GA. The same type of job in the same type of company in Seattle, WA will typically pay $66,321.
[03:48:55] <kerat58> so theoretically if netflix was in atlanta that job should pay $382,000
[03:48:59] <kerat58> instead of $516,000
[03:49:10] <mistiry> yeah that doesnt sound unreasonably off
[03:49:12] <kerat58> that still seems enviously high to me
[03:50:00] <mistiry> for a full stack senior-level software engineer

[03:53:25] <mistiry> kerat58: i would say though, average pay is likely not as high as that number

[04:03:17] <Cl0udNinja> today for example, I made a script to query our test case system and generate an easy to read report for the devs
[04:03:43] <Cl0udNinja> now QA doesnt have to relay so much information in verbal form or in other places, to give devs info on what is/isnt working

[04:10:53] <mistiry> well, you found one
[04:10:56] <mistiry> :D
[04:11:03] <kerat58> hello, i am project manager, watch me play Tetris to make a "critical path" and then spend the rest of the day forwarding emails and asking "Got an update on this issue?"
[04:11:26] <mistiry> a good project manager is valuable to have on your side
[04:11:28] <xe0n> hey...some project managers are good yeah...
[04:12:07] <kerat58> good to have on your side so taht they forward the emails to somewhere else
[04:12:08] <mistiry> same as a good scrum master. which we very much need at my current place...
[04:13:07] <mistiry> kerat58: tell me you never worked with a good project manager without telling me you never worked with a good project manager
[04:13:15] <kerat58> what did you do today?  what will you do tomorrow?  do you have any dependencies?
[04:13:21] <kerat58> there i just did your standup
[04:13:56] <Cl0udNinja> we cut our standups down
[04:13:56] <kerat58> misitry:  "I once had a coworker who used the acronyms 'EOD' and 'EOW' more than any other word"
[04:14:05] <xe0n> and SOW
[04:14:06] <Cl0udNinja> "What are you doing today, do you need anyones help"
[04:14:08] <xe0n> PMP
[04:14:15] <kerat58> yes the SOW
[04:14:55] <mistiry> Standups are only part of their job. Wait until you have a big conflict and shifting priorities and you have a good scrum master in the middle juggling that so you dont have to. 
[04:15:09] <kerat58> Cl0udNinja:  That can further be simplified
[04:15:15] <kerat58> "Whatcha doooooin'?"
[04:15:34] <Cl0udNinja> kerat58, we have a guy who has literally been able to occasionally get away with single word standups
[04:15:41] <Cl0udNinja> it drives me mad
[04:15:42] <kerat58> hahaha
[04:15:47] <kerat58> what is the word?
[04:15:49] <xe0n> eh im in a daily standup, dont waffle on and its fine
[04:15:56] <mistiry> we usually just say if there was anything of note you did or are doing, and if you have anything blocking you
[04:15:59] <xe0n> and just drop off once you've said your things
[04:16:04] <Cl0udNinja> I dont remember what it was, it was just the word of the thing he was doing
[04:16:09] <xe0n> mistiry ++
[04:16:13] <kerat58> Oh
[04:16:15] <kerat58> "networks"
[04:16:20] <Cl0udNinja> basically lol
[04:16:22] <mistiry> "yesterday i deployed X environment as scheduled. today i'll be working on more terraform for X. no blockers" 
[04:16:24] <kerat58> today networks, tomorrow networks, dependency is that networks work
[04:16:24] <mistiry> update done
[04:17:03] <Cl0udNinja> we stick around for everyones standups because its useful info, but we also tend to bullshit for a few minutes after as well
[04:17:15] <mistiry> we have a separate call for that usually
[04:17:26] <mistiry> standup is 10-15 mins for the team real fast
[04:17:42] <kerat58> OMG did you see Belinda's new thread-ripper?  That thing burns so hot.  Can hear the fan spinning from halfway across the office
[04:17:43] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, 15 minutes, sometimes we go 20 with talking after
[04:17:46] <mistiry> and then some go do whatever, some join another call and just collab or bs a bit, some go have breakfast, etc.
[04:17:52] <Cl0udNinja> yep
[04:18:11] <mistiry> im 2h ahead of most of my immediate tema
[04:18:13] <mistiry> team*
[04:18:21] <Cl0udNinja> I'll usually work for like 20-30 minutes after standup, then go for a walk, actually put pants on, etc
[04:18:34] <mistiry> they are doing standup at 8am their time. so most of them disappear for 30 mins or so right after
[04:18:47] <mistiry> i do that sort of stuff before ours
[04:18:51] <mistiry> cuz its 10am my time
[04:19:41] <Cl0udNinja> our standup is 1030 pst, but I wake up at 10 lol. boss says as long as I'm at standup and start no later than standup, he doesnt care
[04:20:02] <mistiry> yeah on previous team standup was 9am my time and same rule
[04:20:09] <Cl0udNinja> nice... my linode bill this month is $40.20
[04:20:21] <mistiry> i get on between 8 and 9. usually im on the PC around 8, but may not log into the work laptop right away
[04:20:41] <kerat58> whatcha hostin on your linode
[04:21:05] <mistiry> ah linode. we had so much stuff there at a previous job, to the tune of like 80k/month or something
[04:21:15] <mistiry> 2-300 VM's of varying sizes and configs
[04:21:15] <Cl0udNinja> mail, web, dump box / jump box
[04:21:17] <kerat58> I had to use Linode for a project a while back, and remember they had a proprietary 'internal' CLI tool that could reach servers even if the KVM could not or something like this...it was pretty novel
[04:22:28] <Cl0udNinja> I host my media server elsewhere because I got a good deal on storage and only have to pay $10/mo for the VM+1TB of storage
[04:22:37] <kerat58> noice

[06:02:39] <monr0e> also this isn't a programming channel. I'm just "lucky" enough to be a dev

[06:04:04] <monr0e> ok, first of all, why are your letter templates a bunch of .docx files? You should really be storing that information in a DB so that those templates can't be accidentally moved, or broken by fileshare changes, or any other number of wrok-stoppage events
[06:04:27] <sd_> 15<P‚ÄãandaBear> Dotx not docx o.o
[06:05:01] <monr0e> That way, you also have precious little maintenance that needs to be done. If your logo changes, all you need do is add it to the stored set of data and update the path
[06:05:22] <sd_> 15<P‚ÄãandaBear> Can always just replace the source file the macro accesses
[06:06:03] <monr0e> It also has the advantage of being automation-friendly - you can programmatically generate letters as and when needed, which would integrate well with just abotu any CRM
[06:06:24] <monr0e> What is also advantageous is that it doesn't take a great deal of time to set up

[06:07:13] <xe0n> i havent done it in 10 years+ lol
[06:07:16] <monr0e> given the likes of council tax reminders and that sorta thing were all automated, it made sense
[06:07:57] <monr0e> we also had a bunch of automated reports that were mailed out to state funded schools in the administrative region

[11:42:00] <SirSceptalot> wait, this is the fourth child that cousin is putting up for adoption?
[11:42:11] <monr0e> Frankly, I'd say this is a question about what you value more - the career you have, or the family you want. SirSceptalot makes a point, witih your existing experience you should not have to significant an issue finding work elsewhere.

[11:50:17] <SirSceptalot> @macgeek I'm really not following on the amount of children and what happened to them
[11:50:50] <csws> SirSceptalot, guessing the other 3 were aborted and now she's carrying a 4th
[11:51:09] <SirSceptalot> ah
[11:51:10] <csws> I'd be talking to family, your parents especially
[11:51:19] <csws> also depends on whether you own the property you're living on
[11:51:27] <csws> I'd be moreso inclined to get the cousin to piss off out of town before making a move

[11:53:20] <csws> also consider what she and the baby daddy are like. if you reckon her issues might be rooted in mental illness then there's a chance the child may turn out similar even if you raise it well

[13:43:29] <Hunterkll> monr0e: check your default security list for the virtual cloud network / public subnet
[13:44:21] <Hunterkll> oh!
[13:44:26] <Hunterkll> monr0e: change your "source port range" to all
[13:44:36] <Hunterkll> your client is using a random port on your machine to connect, not coming FROM 1194 on your machine
[13:44:40] <monr0e> I'm a bit confused though - there's VNIC and virtual cloud network. Is it oen or the other? or do I need to create a vnic? This is what the info panel looks like: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/653243408491610132/948523199468011550/Capture.PNG
[13:44:44] <monr0e> Oooh, I'll try that
[13:44:57] <Hunterkll> like how http, you're using a random high tcp port on your machine, but the destination is port 80 
[13:45:04] <Hunterkll> that's probably your issue
[13:45:08] <Hunterkll> note how the SSH rule has "all" as well
[13:45:14] <Hunterkll> SSH does the same (well any TCP application really does)
[13:45:26] <Hunterkll> monr0e: same for your top one
[13:45:34] <kerat58> yes; in fact i do not really understand the real-world use case for SOURCE port filtering...
[13:45:49] <Hunterkll> kerat58: say, for example, you are doing direct transfers between two systems over one port only....
[13:45:56] <Hunterkll> in a two way scenario

[13:46:23] <Joe-Developer> excellent
[13:47:18] <Hunterkll> kerat58: one example here is, if you configure your domain controllers to only use a constrained range of ports for communication, you don't want a misconfigured/malicious box trying to use the full default range and it working 
[13:47:24] <Hunterkll> i mean, that's a weakish example but eh
[13:47:32] <kerat58> yeah, I didn't consider that, but makes sense

[13:49:52] <monr0e> This is why I'm confused. Everything in that list makes sense to me, and ufw is disabled. I don't appear to have another firewall in place, and I set the machine to respond to ICMP requests.

[13:50:08] <Hunterkll> those rules all work

[13:51:03] <kerat58> silly question; but is this security group applied to the proper interface?
[13:51:17] <Hunterkll> it should NOT be
[13:51:27] <Hunterkll> this is the SG for the VPC (in AWS terms) 
[13:51:40] <Hunterkll> vnic can just have none and just work
[13:51:43] <kerat58> So the 'Subnet' in oracle terms
[13:51:52] <kerat58> or..
[13:51:53] <kerat58> i don't know oracle :(
[13:52:11] <Hunterkll> it's a public subnet, defined inside a "virtual cloud network"
[13:52:19] <kerat58> ok

[13:53:26] <kerat58> lol woops
[13:53:27] <Hunterkll> monr0e: for ping, you need ICMP type 8 
[13:53:32] <monr0e> When I click on the subnet name (under the Primary VNIC listing), I am directed to a seemingly default subnet, with a default security list. Clicking on that security list brings me to the same page as if I had clicked on the Virtual Cloud Network entry inder Instance Details. As far as I can see, that means that this machine is applied to that subnet
[13:53:42] <monr0e> Hunterkll: Good to know, I'm going to test that now
[13:54:03] <monr0e> ok, ping works now
[13:54:28] <Hunterkll> okay, so we know the rules are good
[13:54:33] <monr0e> so I can safely assume that the problem is something to do with the machin itself. 
[13:54:34] <kerat58> now I see why OpenStack has a rule for 'ICMP ALL' 
[13:54:35] <Hunterkll> yup
[13:54:36] <kerat58> lol
[13:55:00] <Hunterkll> kerat58: some types of ICMP you definitely don't want, but some you need (like dest unreach, frag needed, etc)
[13:55:03] <monr0e> Thing is, the server application seems to connect to a list of master servers just fine, as well as bind ports appropriately
[13:55:04] <kerat58> now it is down to netstat to make sure something is bound to the other port(s) 
[13:55:12] <Hunterkll> monr0e: that's outbound traffic though
[13:55:27] <kerat58> egress
[13:55:46] <Hunterkll> and the default egress rule is ANY/ANY Allow basically
[13:55:46] <Hunterkll> :
[13:55:49] <Hunterkll> :)
[13:55:50] <monr0e> Hunterkll: Its both outbound and inbound, the server must receive a reply from the master server
[13:55:53] <kerat58> yep

[13:56:05] <Hunterkll> monr0e: this is why one way firewall rules work... you can talk both ways over an open TCP connection 
[13:56:08] <Hunterkll> once you establish the connection
[13:56:19] *** Joins: itsalexjones (~itsalexjo@82.4.99.241)
[13:56:20] <Hunterkll> you don't need inbound rules/allow for the response to get back
[13:56:27] <Hunterkll> otherwise how would a web browser work with no port forwarding?
[13:57:02] <kerat58> i will be honest; in situations like this I often find myself using telnet too.  if it is TCP that is
[13:57:11] <kerat58> netstat to see if <server> has an app listening on <port>
[13:57:27] <monr0e> Oh yeah, stateful rules. I whooshed myself
[13:57:29] <kerat58> then on the client, telnet 4.3.2.1 123 
[13:57:42] <Hunterkll> monr0e: is it possible that you need TCP, not just UDP somewhere?
[13:59:04] <monr0e> Nope. TCP stuff is only when a client needs to authenticate, and thats outbound from the server. Its a grandfathered old bugbear from the days of integration with krawall 
[13:59:26] <Hunterkll> huh well
[13:59:31] <monr0e> oooh, that's early 2000's, jesus time flies
[13:59:32] <Hunterkll> this says it uses 4534 by default, UDP 
[13:59:39] <Hunterkll> so change the rules to just 4534 instead of a range?
[14:00:21] <monr0e> It's not limited to 4534, thats just where the port range starts. Depending on how many instances I run, that number can increas somewhat exponentially - or at least within the limits of the host system
[14:00:37] <Hunterkll> ah, well, shouldn't be an issue anyway
[14:00:50] <Hunterkll> see if that openvpn works 
[14:00:51] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:01:08] <monr0e> The only reason I set it specifically in this case was because I was attempting a direct connection. Also, that OpenVPN never did work
[14:01:24] <kerat58> but ping does.
[14:01:25] <monr0e> and I never could figure out why
[14:01:30] <Hunterkll> source port range
[14:01:32] <Hunterkll> :)
[14:01:37] <monr0e> yep, probably
[14:01:44] <kerat58> either that, or the app itself has an ACL of sorts
[14:02:02] <monr0e> I did not have this issue in AWS. Or with any other hosting service
[14:02:06] <monr0e> *sigh*
[14:02:12] <kerat58> thank you Mr. Bezos
[14:02:17] <kerat58> i love you aws
[14:02:19] <kerat58> aws, you're amazing
[14:02:20] <monr0e> I hate aws
[14:02:28] <Hunterkll> monr0e: to be fair, you did set the source port ranges yourself
[14:02:30] <Hunterkll> :)
[14:02:34] <monr0e> well, yes
[14:02:37] <Hunterkll> and it has the same meaning as it has on any other firewall system
[14:03:05] <monr0e> although I'm fairly certain the other host I use for this is set up in the same manner
[14:03:12] <monr0e> I could be wrong
[14:03:58] <kerat58> btw, i gotta ask
[14:04:28] <kerat58> why oracle cloud?  just cuz or theres a reason?

[14:19:02] <monr0e> netstat -l shows the application running in its screen session, along with the separate adminlog, but netstat -plnt does not
[14:19:19] <monr0e> I checked iptables earlier, that was also seemingly correct
