[13:33:53] <Neovimisking[m]> You mean try copyq commands?
[13:34:31] <jaawerth[m]> I'm confused. How do you usually use copyq? Isn't it primarily a cli tool? I did see mention of some guis menu stuff but I figured that was  secondary

[18:34:35] <clason[m]> ha!
[18:34:58] <linearbit> clason[m], that's what I did but apparently that doesn't make a difference - I did find out that there's a manual way to set priority for a query though

[18:35:17] <clason[m]> This is intentional, I believe, since in core it actually still does that
[18:35:24] <clason[m]> it's just shadowed by a default mapping.
[18:35:35] <clason[m]> so you can `unmap Y` to get the old behavior back
[18:35:58] <linearbit> I might actually go back to regular syntax from treesitter since it's still quite buggy tbh
[18:36:28] <clason[m]> of course, it's declared as "experimental" for a reason
[18:36:49] *** Joins: veesh (~veesh@77.137.130.85)
[18:36:51] <darkstorm> clason[m]: So the old behaviour yanks the EOL too?
[18:37:17] <clason[m]> it also very much depends on the language -- for some it already works fine, and even better than legacy syntax features, but for others it very much doesn't

[20:23:21] <Hristo[m]> Hey, i'm using neovim and zsh, and i recently added the toggleterm plugin. I noticed that when i open a new terminal it does not source my zshrc config. Now i wanted to try tmux too and i noticed the same behaviour. Does anyone know how to fix that? When i "source ~/.zshrc" the terminal looks like it should, but i'd rather not type it every time i open a new terminal.
