[11:25:06] <MatthiasVance> I was looking at the composition operator (>=>) but that's already defined by Giraffe in my context :(
[11:25:18] <MatthiasVance> I'll look at one of the others, that is also fine
[11:26:36] <biberu> how's your experience with giraffe so far?
[11:32:14] <MatthiasVance> I can't say I'm doing much with it :D
[11:32:49] <MatthiasVance> But it looks good to work with, just chaining httphandlers
[11:33:12] <MatthiasVance> As in, I'm just making some minor changes not doing any big features
