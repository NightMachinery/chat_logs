[03:19:59] <GunArm> with linux containers creating a public ip for the container seems to be trivial
[03:21:18] <tabakhase> uff, thats the first one this year :D -- then just from the docs, id say "yes..." - but i rly got no clue, as most of the channel, you may be more successfull in #windows-server even :| (as its more a hyperV than a docker thing)
[03:21:59] <GunArm> on windows, this is starting to seem like an untenable nightmare looking at https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/networking-blog/l2bridge-container-networking/ba-p/1180923
[03:22:37] <GunArm> even after setting up the network you apparently have to create a bunch of janky network settings not just on the docker host but every (?) machine you want to talk to it...
[03:23:38] <tabakhase> and OT: "linux trivial" - is bit of a meh - macvlan is also some stitching (and kinda "only allowed if published ports dont do it for you" (dhcp is like one of the rare exceptional services)) -- and if were then talking "on windows" you get the whole additional VM-shim that sits inbetween still :D

[03:27:36] <tabakhase> but ye as said, never touched win-containers and all in all did maybe half an hour of hyperV ;S so i know nothing there
[03:28:12] <GunArm> hm well I guess the main issue is that most of this is way over my head
[03:28:24] <GunArm> we have linux containers (on a linux host) that seem to have been configured for their own IP merely by adding `--hostname {ip} --publish {ip}:{port}` to the run command
[03:30:00] <GunArm> that explicitly doesn't work on windows but I stumbled onto a blog talking about using the transparent network driver which sounded promising, that's what you quoted from about assinging ips from the physical network.  and I got all that to work but even though it's an ip from the physical network.... only the host can connect to it
[03:30:49] <GunArm> hm, perhaps because of this caveat: `When this mode is used in a virtualization scenario (container host is a VM) MAC address spoofing is required.`.
[03:31:30] <tabakhase> --hostname {ip} does nothing asside setting /etc/hostname in there ||| --publish {ip}:{port}  more {port}:{port} or {ip}:{port}:{port} - but yep, thats "published ports" (then applied using iptables or with a userland-daemon) --- also the way to go for having multiple IPs on one server or such things
[03:32:31] <GunArm> ah ok so the --hostname part is irrelevant.  but yeah with linux, I guess bridge is the default and it lets you just claim a new IP there
[03:33:21] <GunArm> try that on windows and it says "docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create endpoint affectionate_feynman on network nat: Windows does not support host IP addresses in NAT settings."

[03:35:54] <tabakhase> anything other than publishing ports is rly "only things that CANT be forwarded" -- sounds odd that windows-containers is supposedly the opposite -- but also not entirely wrong given that windows-containers are actually vms to all i know :D

[03:56:47] <nickjj> just asking because i've done similar things to you as workarounds but was able to solve them in a way where they weren't necessary to do anymore
[03:58:10] <rawtaz> im not sure i see a possibility for that really. the bind mount in question is for pure file storage that is populated by the users of the service, so i dont see that it's something we keep in version control
[03:58:19] <bn_work> hi, docker 20.10.12, what determine the size of `Sending build context to Docker daemon` when doing a `docker build`?  Also, if I delete files that I used from within the image during build step, does that reclaim space?
[03:58:44] <rawtaz> as it is now i simply have to do a chown on a dir when deploying the compose app. so it's not that bad. its just annoying :D
[03:58:58] <rawtaz> but it's just a matter of documenting it and its no biggie
[03:59:07] <rawtaz> what were the data you version controlled?
[03:59:19] <nickjj> yeah, i've done literally the same thing as you, and the chown happened in a git post receive hook on deploy
[03:59:32] <rawtaz> ah gotcha
[04:00:20] <nickjj> but if you configure your dockerfile to run your stuff as a non-root user, you can have everything be owned by your deploy user on your host without needing to chown things from root to a specific user/group
[04:03:51] <rawtaz> thats what isnt happening. its the nextcloud:23.0.0-fpm-alpine image. im bind mounting ./data/storage to /storage and ./data/html to /var/www/html. when i run it, the latter gets owned by 82:root and works fine, but the former (./data/storage) gets owned by root:root and nextcloud complains it cant write to /storage. both folders were created by docker i suppose.
[04:04:42] <rawtaz> i havent hecked, but one explanation could be that the entryscript in the container runs as root first and then populates and sets proper permissions on the html dir, whereas it doesnt do that on /storage, and then fpm runs as www-user or similar.
[04:05:36] <rawtaz> in what you said last above, did you mean that i could have the entryscript of the Dockerimage configure the dirs and permissions and ownership properly, and *then* run the actual service process as non-root?

[04:06:27] <rawtaz> yeah. im pretty sure my theory is correct
[04:07:16] <rawtaz> i could of course build my own extension of this image, but for now ill just document the chown command that needs to be run. one thing at a time :)
[04:07:33] <nickjj> in your dockerfile you could `useradd --create-home myuser` and RUN chown any directories to myuser before and then USER myuser before running your process
[04:07:50] <nickjj> and now every file the container creates will be owned by myuser:myuser on the host
[04:08:01] <rawtaz> using git im not sure how to control the ownership of the ./data/storage dir - i would have to create a .gitkeep or similar in that dir and commit that - will git then record and restore the ownership of that directory too?
[04:08:09] <nickjj> well, more specifically whoever is the "real" user for uid/gid 1000
[04:08:46] <nickjj> yeah i would commit it with a .keep file
[04:08:50] <rawtaz> nickjj: yeah but RUN chown wont have an effect on a bind mount that is only applied when the container is actually run - that RUN only runs during the build stage
[04:09:37] <nickjj> yeah the RUN will happen at build time but it'll make sure everything is correctly owned in the image and reflected back out through the volume
[04:09:47] <rawtaz> this isnt a volume, it's a bind mount
[04:10:05] <rawtaz> so theres nothing from the image copied into the volume, since theres no volume (and bind mounts arent copied into)
[04:10:05] <nickjj> isn't just a volumes: ["./whatever:/app"] type of mount?

[04:11:55] <nickjj> if you have a ./public/uploads directory built into your image that's owned by myuser:myuser and bind mounted out to your host while your container is running as a non-root user, any files the container places into ./public/uploads will be owned by the correct user on the host (whoever is 1000:1000)
[04:11:56] <rawtaz> yes, but unless im misunderstanding you, you are suggesting to "prep" the image such that it creates the proper directory in the /storage, with the right owner, and that this should then be used in the "volume" (which isnt a named volume here). but that wont work, since the bind mount simply overrides anything thats in the image
[04:12:32] <rawtaz> btw here's some info: https://kopy.io/CaDrC - the last part is the host filessystem right after a vanilla start of the service (when there was nothing in ./nextcloud/data at all)

[04:17:30] <nickjj> (this public directory could be your uploads directory, it's the thing volume mounted to the host that might have uploads, etc.)
[04:17:54] <nickjj> the compose file mounts it like this: https://github.com/nickjj/docker-flask-example/blob/cb4f8f3420c360a0931b9d7f3c1055798de5e9d0/docker-compose.yml#L17
[04:18:14] <nickjj> it's an env var mainly because i want different mounts in dev vs prod (everything in dev for easy development and only the public dir for prod)
[04:18:47] <nickjj> then in the Dockerfile i make a new user in the image and make sure everything in /app is owned by that user https://github.com/nickjj/docker-flask-example/blob/cb4f8f3420c360a0931b9d7f3c1055798de5e9d0/Dockerfile#L41-L42
[04:19:06] <nickjj> in this case /app is my WORKDIR
[04:19:23] <nickjj> L44 right below it switches to this new user and now everything beyond this point is running as a non-root user

[04:20:24] <nickjj> internally as in the container
[04:20:51] <nickjj> but on your docker host all of the files are owned by rawtaz:rawtaz or whatever your host's username is -- you can actually test this now if you wanted to clone and run that project
[04:21:36] <nickjj> this works out of the box with docker desktop on mac / windows , it will also work out of the box on linux as long as your rawtaz:rawtaz user is uid 1000 and gid 1000 (on most linux systems it will be since that's the first user you create)
[04:22:11] <nickjj> but you can test it by upping the project, exec'ing into the container and running: touch /app/public/somefile.txt
[04:22:21] <nickjj> it will get volume mounted back as the correct user (this emulates a user uploading a file)

[04:27:34] <nickjj> i think we are, it's a solution to ensure you have bind mounted files to your host that are owned by the correct user and it persists user generated files in the bind mount between restarts
[04:27:55] <tabakhase> not sure if its late, or im just confused :D - feels like im missing some insider there...

[07:13:33] <tabakhase> 0,1,2? - but this forks, and that example doesnt seem to make all that much sense tbh ;D
[07:13:49] <bn_work> stage 1 (previous) = copies build files in to install + installs, then deletes build files, stage 2 (new stage) = take installed artifacts
[07:14:59] <tabakhase> no need to delete as you shall selectively copy --- if you do delete, your final result will be clean, but it will still sit in buildcache at full size anyhow
[07:15:04] <bn_work> tabakhase: in mine it's 1,2.  that linked example seems to have 1, 2a, 2b, which isn't what I'm doing (I just linked to it since that's where it explains "using previous stage as a new stage")
[07:17:31] <bn_work> tabakhase: but if you say `FROM stage1 AS stage2`, wouldn't it start with stage1's FS (post-delete)?
[07:18:47] <tabakhase> correct - but thats a delete i can undo by just choping of your RUN layer with the "rm"
[07:18:55] <bn_work> I know normally in "multi-stage" you start from scratch as in https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/#name-your-build-stages but I'm trying to avoid having to do everything over again just to omit the previously copied & deleted files?
[07:19:14] <tabakhase> only way to get rid of things is COPY --from=...
[07:20:18] <bn_work> the rm actually occurs in the build script so it's embedded in it
[07:21:32] <bn_work> but I think I see what you mean though about "chop[p?]ing of [my] RUN layer"
[07:23:15] <bn_work> tabakhase: however, if this is the only way, then do you know the answer to my 2nd Q?
[07:23:37] <tabakhase> and thats not even "work" - there is a folder with the name of that stages hash (your COPY of the source) somewhere deep in /var/lib/docker that one can just "cp" from
[07:26:10] <tabakhase> the "Use a previous stage as a new stage" usecase is more in the line of "FROM apline as base, RUN install make on it, FROM base AS build, RUN make build, FROM base, COPY --from=buid /some/result /that/result, CMD make run" to rly have a use from it i guess...
[07:26:23] <tabakhase> or you can abuse that as "step to run tests"
[07:27:16] <tabakhase> (think install all, then "fork", reinstall WITH dev, run testing, and teleport back to before the fork)
[07:28:08] <nickjj> rawtaz, you'll need to use docker-compose 1.27+ then you should be good to go
[07:29:29] <bn_work> tabakhase: right, I understand the use-cases of https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/#use-a-previous-stage-as-a-new-stage, like the one you described.  My question is if I had ARGs + ENVs + LABEL from prior stage, do those carry over to the next stage?  or would one need to redefine those?
[07:29:32] <tabakhase> bn_work i think the "install make" example case may hit closest on "having to do everything over again" - with the key that you can only share stuff before the sourcecode-COPY, so that must happen in the fork, not the base

[07:35:35] <bn_work> what if I made the dir where the media is copied into the image a volume mount, would that solve the issue?

[07:37:37] <tabakhase> so far i dont see a thing that speaks against a bog standard multistage from anything you said
[07:39:02] <bn_work> basically the files to be "copied" into the image would be manifested via the volume mount, and after build is done, delete from mount dir, then when run, it wouldn't have those files?

[09:06:58] <Sqaure> to provide 
[09:08:34] <ikke> sure
[09:08:46] <ikke> but, it depends a bit
[09:09:05] <ikke> if your webapp has its own application server, you would run nginx in a separate container and forward it
[09:12:46] <Sqaure> ikke, ok, so still 2 containers you mean? 
[09:12:59] <ikke> yes
[09:13:33] <ikke> otherwise you need to juggle around starting both nginx and your application server in the same container, which is possible, but more complicated
[09:14:06] <ikke> with something like docker-compose, it's trivial to setup multiple containers
[09:14:13] <Sqaure> i was thinking both in the same container. But i see benefit of separation

[13:04:31] <OxxY_> Hi, I have some trouble understanding docker networking. I am trying to get a container to run on a VPN connection. I have setup a container that runs my VPN and setup another container to use the vpn container as network using --net=container;vpnname
[13:04:56] <OxxY_> and here my issue occours, how do I now access said continer on the LAN?
[13:05:16] <OxxY_> I have tried to read multiple guides but they all seem to gloss over this issue
[13:10:31] <gordonjcp> what do you mean by "on the LAN"?

[13:12:14] <OxxY_> say I have the container running one machine A, and I'd like to communicate with the container from machine B on my local network
[13:12:43] <OxxY_> if I just use the default docker-network i can use machine A's local ip
[13:13:03] <OxxY_> but that breaks when the container uses the vpn-container as network
[13:13:23] <gordonjcp> okay, so machine A needs to forward traffic I guess

[18:33:03] <programmerq> luva: there are a few places to set things. The --bip and --fixed-cidr options to dockerd do indeed only configure the default docker0 legacy network. When a network is created, docker picks a range. If it's a local scoped network, like the 'bridge', 'macvlan', or 'ipvlan' driver when doing 'docker network create', docker will pick a range from a range of ranges to use with that network unless
[18:33:06] <programmerq> explicitly specified. You can change that range of ranges with the --default-address-pool argument to dockerd. If you do set that in either the dockerd args or in the /etc/docker/daemon.json config file, you'll need to restart docker and it'll only apply to newly created networks.
[18:33:49] <programmerq> If you want to set the range of ranges for a swarm scoped network, then you must specify it at the time the swarm is created using the docker swarm init '--default-addr-pool' and '--default-addr-pool-mask-length' options
[18:33:53] <luva> Thanks programmerq
[18:34:21] <luva> that is very helpful
[18:35:05] <luva> I just find it weird that even though I have only around 10 networks and it never used the ones starting with 192.X but now suddenly all of the new ones are with 192.X. Anyways, this will probably fix it, thank you
[18:35:43] <programmerq> those features were added after my customers had undesirable behaviors like docker's default hardcoded range of ranges conflicting with internal IP addresses. In those cases where you have end users trying to do 'docker-compose up' or 'docker stack deploy', you can't tell them that they must explicitly specify a range that doesn't conflict and consult a spreadsheet, etc...
[18:36:04] <programmerq> so it's much better to just have the docker administrator configure the range of ranges ahead of time
[18:36:50] <gordonjcp> programmerq: is it generally a good idea to specify a network and network range for a suite of containers?
[18:38:07] <luva> yes, thats exactly what can happen. Also now the IP range it uses is really similar to my lan network, so I cant distinguish really fast if its a container or a lan device. Thanks programmerq

[18:51:27] <programmerq> gordonjcp: "good idea" -- it depends. The default range of ranges that docker picks from tries to be things that aren't as commonly used. Normally you'd only need to specify the range of ranges if the defaults introduce a conflict. Like if my company has run 172.x.x.x ip addresses in its internal network for years before adopting docker, then any system running docker would suddenly not be able to
[18:51:30] <programmerq> communicate with the company network devices that fall in the range(s) of active networks. I helped someone troubleshoot this once where they were connected to their company VPN and ssh'd to a machine. As soon as they did 'docker network create' they couldn't communicate with the entire docker node anymore. It turns out that their internal IP address range at their company for the VPN was a 172
[18:51:32] <programmerq> address range, and the docker network create they ran created a network that directly conflicted with the apparent ip address their vpn connection had. So the docker host all of a sudden had a route that said "hey any packets for this 172.x.y.z range should go to this bridge device and not back out through the router"
[18:51:36] <programmerq> lots of fun to troubleshoot that one.

[20:29:38] <arkanoid> if I have a running mysql container but I forgot to add volume to get persistend data after container down, how can I add it without losing existing data?
[20:30:36] <arkanoid> I tried to add it to docker-compose.yml but I'm getting:WARNING: Service "mysql" is using volume "/var/lib/mysql" from the previous container. Host mapping "/home/server/docker/project/mysql_data" has no effect.
[20:30:38] <ikke> arkanoid: do a mysql dump from trhe running container
[20:32:12] <arkanoid> can't I copy /var/lib/mysql outside?

[20:32:53] <tabakhase> docker cp / docker-compose cp yea - but that ends up beeing a few more steps (having to create a new one, then clean and reset that with your data)
[20:33:21] <Eugen80> ikke: added version. After container restart I see completly different IP. Before: 172.30.0.x, now 192.168.40.x
[20:33:50] <Eugen80> 192.168.x.x is my local network
[20:35:15] <programmerq> tabakhase: you wouldn't need to "clean and reset" a new volume. Just copy the data directly into a blank volume using docker cp. Create the container with the new volume, but don't start it. then use docker cp against the non-running container, then start the container.

[20:36:37] <dob1> ah!
[20:37:13] <tabakhase> programmerq guess ya could muck around with "docker-compose create" (or now up --no-start i guess) instead too true
[20:38:26] <tabakhase> so, docker-compose stop, docker-compose cp out, docker-compose down -v mysql, add volume-config, docker-compose up --no-start, docker-compose cp back in, docker-compose up
[20:38:36] <tabakhase> or smth along those lines :P
