[00:02:40] <eliocamp> do.call(function, list(...., par = c(bla, bla bla))?
[00:03:39] <Bayes> so you mean having all inner functions be of the kind f1 <- function(X, y, par) instead of f1 <- function(X, y, beta0, beta1), f2 <- function(X, y, theta, gamma, lambda) ?
[00:04:10] <eliocamp> I thought that the function had a par argument?
[00:04:16] <Bayes> xD
[00:04:24] <Bayes> I should get used to providing mwe with my questions
[00:09:09] <Bayes> yeah I think since I'm coding this from scratch
[00:09:18] <Bayes> and I'm in a rather good mood today
[00:09:30] <Bayes> I'll name the vector at creation
[00:09:47] <Bayes> and have R propagate the names along all manipulations

[01:42:56] <DrNostril> Hi everybody
[01:43:00] <DrNostril> how we doing tonight
[01:44:09] <DrNostril> thanks for the advice on the join the other night
[01:44:22] <DrNostril> project went very well
[01:45:01] <DrNostril> it was a simple one liner with merge() and a zoo::na.fill()
[01:45:14] <rickyrick> hot
[01:45:21] <DrNostril> hey rickyrick
[01:45:23] <rickyrick> hai
[01:45:30] * DrNostril inhales deeply
[01:45:35] <DrNostril> mmmm it stinks
[01:45:50] * rickyrick is currently shitting
[01:45:54] <DrNostril> lmao
[01:45:59] <rickyrick> :^)
[01:46:03] <mefistofeles> rickyrick: wait? you too?
[01:46:07] <since_> well its ickyrick, but as with all r stuff you have to prefix an r
[01:46:10] <since_> :p
[01:46:11] <DrNostril> how are things in your dimension
[01:46:14] <rickyrick> :^)
[01:46:21] <rickyrick> 2worked4me
[01:46:55] <DrNostril> i c
[01:47:24] <DrNostril> may all your coefficients converge in < 1000 iterations
[01:47:29] <rickyrick> lol i wish
[01:47:40] * rickyrick revs up niter = 1e6
[01:47:48] <DrNostril> mine slammed down with 2000 weights in < 20 iterations
[01:47:55] <DrNostril> the lm() was slower
[01:48:04] <DrNostril> jesus
[01:48:11] <DrNostril> hope you have some stinky stinky hardware
[01:48:20] <DrNostril> are you multithreading?
[01:48:46] <DrNostril> i try to get my models training on all my cpu cores but things often lock up for me if I use more than 1
[01:48:52] <DrNostril> feels really wasteful
[01:49:00] <rickyrick> No multithreading within a run :^)
[01:49:12] <DrNostril> my bash and python projects dont mind eating every core
[01:49:13] <rickyrick> Convergence is just logarithmic, which is sadface.rds
[01:49:15] <DrNostril> yikes
[01:49:19] <DrNostril> okay
[01:49:40] <DrNostril> do you think it's worth building a small cluster
[01:51:14] <DrNostril> i've been threatening to make a kubernetes junkcore frankblob out of orange pis
[01:51:34] <DrNostril> *frankenblob
[01:52:30] <rickyrick> Just beowulf it like the old kids
[01:52:41] <DrNostril> theres containers now
[01:53:06] <DrNostril> really want to, but i'm trying to pick the most practical way
[01:53:20] <rickyrick> I had a funky R cluster setup running across a Core 2 Duo with Windows 7, an Athlon with FreeBSD and a P3 with Windows 2000 :^)
[01:53:21] <DrNostril> like how can i actually design the system to be useful for stuff
[01:53:29] <DrNostril> what really?
[01:53:31] <rickyrick> Yeah
[01:53:37] <DrNostril> was it worthwhile thats fckn baller
[01:53:41] <rickyrick> No :^)
[01:53:41] <since_> the P3 did the console logging?
[01:53:49] <rickyrick> Couldn't figure out how to get the instances to start automatically
[01:53:53] <rickyrick> Had to run the command on each machine
[01:54:01] <rickyrick> since_: No :^)
[01:54:01] <DrNostril> thats not the point
[01:54:22] <DrNostril> if you had to do it again, what hardware would you use
[01:54:29] <rickyrick> Everything reasonable I had available
[01:54:45] <rickyrick> Back in the day Valve used to have every computer in the office accept compile workers for their Source engine maps
[01:54:45] <DrNostril> i have like 4 single board computers
[01:54:53] <DrNostril> i can just get a gigabit switch and some cat6
[01:54:55] <rickyrick> Or GoldSrc
[01:54:57] <rickyrick> I don't remember
[01:55:10] <since_> if there is OpenMP for R use OpenMP i guess
[01:55:21] <DrNostril> hmmm hi since_
[01:55:26] <rickyrick> ya that's probably the sane way to do it
[01:55:28] <DrNostril> you have helped me in the past too
[01:55:32] <rickyrick> I did it with makePSOCKCluster
[01:55:43] <DrNostril> *googling noises*
[01:56:16] <DrNostril> oh it's just the parallel package?
[01:56:27] <rickyrick> ya
[01:56:36] <DrNostril> how do you build the spec though
[01:56:43] <rickyrick> I don't recall exactly
[01:56:46] <DrNostril> fair
[01:56:49] <DrNostril> i'll read the docs
[01:56:55] <rickyrick> But the main machine could spit out the command line arguments you needed to run on each machine
[01:57:01] <DrNostril> this is sick, kinda surprised you guys did that
[01:57:03] <since_> mh there seems to be no openmp for r
[01:57:05] <DrNostril> i thought i was crazy
[01:57:18] <rickyrick> I just wanted to see if I could get R 4.1 on Windows 2000 :^)
[01:57:28] <rickyrick> Just had to recompile to target SSE instead of SSE2
[01:58:04] <DrNostril> reason i ask is because i'm sick of running models on my laptop for hours
[01:58:44] <DrNostril> i need a second machine to act as a server, and i want a little cluster ... expandable, modular, cheapish. just has to be more powerful than my thinkpad
[01:59:27] <since_> then get an amd server or sth
[01:59:47] <rickyrick> ^
[01:59:47] <DrNostril> should i just not be stupid and get a regular server
[01:59:47] <since_> unless you do GPU stuff
[01:59:52] <rickyrick> Then just ssh into it
[02:00:03] <DrNostril> ssh is my homeboy
[02:00:22] <DrNostril> in my mind i had imagined 10 SBCs and then 20...
[02:01:02] <rickyrick> Just get 20  retired dell towers for $20
[02:01:12] <rickyrick> :^)
[02:01:24] <DrNostril> the power consumption though do.0b
[02:04:46] <since_> do you even do parallel code?
[02:05:00] <DrNostril> not yet
[02:05:05] <DrNostril> that's why i want this headache
[02:05:37] <DrNostril> if you're real good and pencil and paper math it can yield lots of power
[02:06:19] <DrNostril> you guys are probably right, I should start with a small server
[02:06:38] <since_> mh
[02:06:50] <since_> then it more sounds like you want single core perfomance and RAM
[02:07:01] <since_> so no amd for you.
[02:07:14] <DrNostril> that's what i have going on rn
[02:07:40] <since_> mh. the apple M1 architecture seems to be strong aswell
[02:07:41] <DrNostril> i have eaten the whole 64 GB a few times, but it was my mistake
[02:07:57] <DrNostril> i have used a usb tpu with great results
[02:08:00] <DrNostril> but only with python
[02:08:23] <since_> and i recently read of people running their SAT solvers on iphones because its faster :D
[02:08:43] <DrNostril> lmaau
[02:08:45] <DrNostril> absurd
[02:09:00] <DrNostril> so edge iphone R server
[02:09:07] <DrNostril> that actually isn't a terrible idea
[02:15:55] <since_> DrNostril: https://twitter.com/siderealed/status/1057682481334218752
[02:16:15] <since_> apparently it was 2018. damn you covid.
[02:16:21] <DrNostril> lmaoooo
[02:16:29] <DrNostril> holy crap i'm dying
[02:16:32] * DrNostril is dying
[02:17:57] <DrNostril> i'm gonna get a smashed iphone
[02:18:01] <DrNostril> thats janktastic
[02:18:25] <DrNostril> https://jacobsalmela.com/content/images/2020/05/ios-ethernet.jpg
[02:18:30] <DrNostril> people are using ipads...
[02:19:45] <DrNostril> or sighhhhh a mac mini
[02:23:01] <since_> don't forget the apple TVs
[02:23:49] <since_> but apple stuff is not nice because of needed jailbreaking etc
[02:33:12] <DrNostril> server with a TPU
[02:33:47] <Bayes> no cluster here but I got me an old Think Station, 20 thread Xeon and 64gbs from ebay for less than 400 bucks
[02:33:49] <Bayes> so it's something
[02:34:07] <DrNostril> damn thats a steal
[02:34:12] <Bayes> ikr
[02:34:18] <DrNostril> it really is
[02:34:27] <Bayes> and fortunately no additional electricity cost cause electricity is flat
[02:34:28] <DrNostril> convinced
[02:34:31] <rickyrick> ECC RAM?
[02:34:39] <DrNostril> nvme?
[02:34:39] <Bayes> yep ECC RAM is cheapo
[02:34:43] <rickyrick> hot
[02:34:51] <rickyrick> NVMe is overrated :^)
[02:34:54] * rickyrick spins up IDE drives
[02:35:02] <Bayes> I'm not factoring in the disk cause I had an ssd already
[02:35:06] <DrNostril> hmmm
[02:35:19] <Bayes> but I don't think you need to prioritize a fast disk
[02:35:20] <DrNostril> yo that's the smartest idea
[02:35:37] <rickyrick> ya if you're paging to disk during your computation ur already screwed
[02:35:37] <Bayes> cpu & ram > ssd
[02:35:51] <DrNostril> holy crap theyre cheap
[02:35:54] <DrNostril> and available
[02:35:58] <DrNostril> with that xeon
[02:36:12] <rickyrick> link me up fam
[02:36:27] <Bayes> the balance is 2-4gb per thread for common stuff
[02:36:59] <Bayes> stan eats up all the ram so that's different but so far 64gb for < 100 dollars was enough
[02:37:49] <rickyrick> Time to write custom assembler that stays entirely inside L2 cache or better :^)
[02:38:12] <rickyrick> actually L3 i guess
[02:38:12] <Bayes> no, I'll leave that to the engineers
[02:38:33] <Bayes> that's something I sometimes cannot agree on with peers
[02:38:58] <Bayes> some statisticians consider themselves statistical engineers while others statistical scientists

[03:21:11] <DrNostril> more cores or faster clock speed

[03:21:33] <DrNostril> 64 is plenty for me atm
[03:21:43] <Bayes> ah il scientifico della computazione
[03:21:43] <Bayes> xD
[03:21:44] <DrNostril> and clustering gives bottlenecks so you cant use all of it
[03:21:53] <DrNostril> lmaooo
[03:22:01] <Bayes> do you have HPC access via ur uni?
[03:22:10] <DrNostril> no idea what that means

[03:22:38] <DrNostril> there is a remote R server i can use
[03:22:39] <Bayes> if your uni has a cluster you can use
[03:22:44] <DrNostril> but it's kinda shit
[03:22:47] <Bayes> ah ok
[03:23:05] <DrNostril> i don't really believe in cloud data science
[03:23:08] <Bayes> otherwise you use your already nice machine to prototype like crazy and submit jobs to the hpc

[03:23:43] <Bayes> that's a different thing
[03:23:47] <DrNostril> yes
[03:23:56] <Bayes> like you don't want to run defense contracts on the cloud
[03:24:04] <DrNostril> they're not defense contracts
[03:24:26] <DrNostril> i can use cloud for data capture
[03:24:38] <DrNostril> but not for file recovery or data sci
[03:24:51] <DrNostril> hence my handle lmao

[22:31:56] <Bayes> https://i.imgur.com/UOrKChD.png "[...] implies that it is feasible to train a model and to evaluate its importance using the /same data/ [...] although sample-splitting are helpful, this suggests that they're not strictly necessary depending on the sample size and the complexity of the model class"
[22:49:00] <fendur> "importance"?
[22:53:33] <Bayes> feature importance
[22:54:01] <Bayes> as in quantifying how much a model prediction accuracy relies on a given feature
[23:00:07] <fendur> gotcha thanks

[23:24:05] <Bayes> https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/purrr.pdf
[23:24:08] <Bayes> looking at the first page
[23:25:02] <Bayes> it'd be cool to have pmap, imap, pwalk, and iwalk on base R
[23:26:04] <Bayes> the rest is syntactic sugar, though I must say that DF <- map_dfr(f, x) looks neater than DF <- do.call(rbind, Map(f, x)), which is a kind of pattern I tend to use quite a bit
[23:27:58] *** Quits: triberio13 (~triberio1@195.53.32.158) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[23:34:49] <Bayes> and apparently things like walk is implemented on C++
