[01:15:09] <saltrocklamp[m]> is there any jupyter client implementation for neovim?
[01:16:06] <saltrocklamp[m]> although i suppose you can just use `jupyter console` in terminal mode
[01:16:48] <saltrocklamp[m]> but that makes things a lot messier and more limiting. consider all the fiddly little implementation aspects of neoterm and iron.nvim
[01:16:54] <clason[m]> https://github.com/bfredl/nvim-ipy
[01:17:13] <saltrocklamp[m]> oh nice!
[01:19:08] <saltrocklamp[m]> i like this design too and appreciate that it's not ipython-only despite the name
[01:20:38] <saltrocklamp[m]> semi-related followup question: is there some framework/plugin that supports repl-like interactions, but with a plain buffer and not a terminal buffer?
[01:21:30] <saltrocklamp[m]> like inferior-scheme, where the output and input are interleaved in the same buffer
[01:21:59] <saltrocklamp[m]> i know conjure and vlime have this, but the output is in a separate buffer (which is probably good enough)

[01:52:39] <dre> OK 
[01:53:09] <dre> i have an interesting idea; - is there a nvim plugin that could handle when people either "paste" an image into the terminal, or drag an image file onto the terminal? 
[01:53:37] <mjlbach[m]> there's hologram, not so much drag/paste though
[01:53:53] <dre> iirc dragging a file gets a "file://home/blah" handle; which theoretically could be interpreted by the plugin
[01:54:17] <dre> because I want to have that sort of drag/paste that other markdown editors have for images; ( github web editor for example ) 
[01:56:25] <dre> I want to use nvim to edit the markdown obviously, but i can't find a nice way for images to work? I and I don't want to be taken too far out of the flow when I write

[08:37:56] <mjlbach[m]> I think with anticonceal it would be more doable
[08:38:28] <mjlbach[m]> one thing that would be cool is to enter a "virtual" insert mode where you insert virtual text into the buffer, we could then use anticonceal to mirror that virtual text and apply a single client side operation to set the buf text to match the virtual text

[08:46:12] <muniter[m]> I believe is a preview else LSP would go crazy everytime
[08:46:44] <mjlbach[m]> It's not that bad if you're deferring text updates
[08:47:33] <mjlbach[m]> It would be nice for plugins to start leveraging virtual text to avoid doing any actual edit operations until the user confirms it
[08:47:42] <mjlbach[m]> and then do it in one shot so it's a single op
[08:47:45] <muniter[m]> I'd imagine, I just think it's a preview since I haven't had an issue with LSP or other plugins linting or reacting when previewing the substitute.
[08:49:35] <muniter[m]> Yes,  quite some plugins that need to update to the new capabilities. Virtual text and extmarks. Cough surround cough
[08:50:08] <mjlbach[m]> surround would never do that because it would leverage too many neovim specific APIs :P

[16:07:51] <SeanDewar[m]> its basically :global but exclude matches
[16:08:38] <dundargoc[m]> Wut? Isn't the whole point of global to only do something on matches?
[16:09:03] <dundargoc[m]> I am confusion
[16:09:21] <SeanDewar[m]> its useful when u want to delete all lines that don't match

[16:29:00] <dundargoc[m]> You have a change to redeem yourself if you want to. I'm trying to read up on buffer mappings. Basically: what's the point? If I don't intend to create new mappings on the spot, why not just use global mappings?
[16:29:19] <SeanDewar[m]> pretty useful for lsp mappings that override defaults
[16:29:26] <dundargoc[m]> The related help on it is on usr_40.txt, but I don't want to read spoilers.
[16:29:34] <SeanDewar[m]> i.e. i have go to definition mapped to <C-[>
[16:29:47] <dundargoc[m]> Well yes, but why not make it global?
[16:30:00] <dundargoc[m]> I don't see the point in making it buffer-only.
[16:30:02] <SeanDewar[m]> s/[/]/
[16:30:16] <elianiva[m]> when you want the default behaviour for the buffer that doesn't have LSP attached
[16:30:18] <clason[m]> Because you also have buffers without LSP where you want to use the original functionality=
[16:30:19] <clason[m]> s/=/?/
[16:30:24] <SeanDewar[m]> C-] is used for jumping to definition using tags
[16:30:34] <SeanDewar[m]> but with lsp i'd rather use the server
[16:30:39] <SeanDewar[m]> what would be better tho is a tagfunc
[16:30:54] <SeanDewar[m]> i think there's a PR for that tho
[16:30:58] <clason[m]> (the point is that you create this buffer-only mapping in the `on_attach` functions so it's only set where the LSP server is running)
[16:31:18] <clason[m]> prime example: `K` for hover, without clobbering the helptag function 
[16:31:55] <dundargoc[m]> But won't K always be mapped to `<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>` regardless?
[16:32:06] <clason[m]> no, that's the point
[16:32:21] <SeanDewar[m]> only want that for the buffers with the lsp attached
[16:32:40] <dundargoc[m]> What decides when it will be mapped then?
[16:32:50] <SeanDewar[m]> on_attach
[16:32:58] <clason[m]> the `on_attach` function is run for every buffer an LSP attaches to; if you create a buffer-local mapping _in that function_, it will only be defined for those buffers
[16:33:01] <clason[m]> (try it out!)
[16:34:28] <clason[m]> <dundargoc[m]> "You have a change to redeem..." <- ☝️ that's "if" is the lynchpin -- you _do_ intend to create new mappings on the spot

[16:36:38] <dundargoc[m]> clason[m]: I tried out swapping `nvim_buf_set_keymap` with `nvim_set_keymap`. I don't really see a difference?
[16:37:03] <elianiva[m]> you won't if you have the bufnr set to 0
[16:37:04] <SeanDewar[m]> unless u go to another buffer
[16:37:13] <clason[m]> like opening a help buffer

[19:08:48] <det0x[m]> this is a picture from `uivonim`, neovim gui project 
[19:09:02] <SeanDewar[m]> smolck: 
[19:09:06] <SeanDewar[m]> hehe
[19:09:09] <det0x[m]> status line on the endline with no command line is too beautiful to not notice 
[19:09:33] <neovim[m]> SeanDewar[m]: already saw it, have "uivonim" as a keyword in element :P
[19:09:57] <neovim[m]> lmk if there's anything I can do to improve it det0x ; haven't done much with it as of late but I probably should
[19:10:19] <det0x[m]> oh, nice! didn't expect to see the creator here haha 🧙‍♂️ 
[19:11:23] <det0x[m]> neovim[m]: will do! i like it a lot so far 
[19:12:25] <neovim[m]> really wish I could just get rid of electron but keep the UI
[19:12:41] <neovim[m]> webview is just . . . not great
[19:15:00] <neovim[m]> (which is why I haven't touched it as of late, been looking into doing something low-level and native that avoids web tech entirely)
[19:15:21] <det0x[m]> electron is my only gripe with it as well
[19:15:31] <det0x[m]> are there guis written in rust's `iced`?
[19:16:01] <det0x[m]> neovide does not use `iced` from what i remember
[19:17:15] <neovim[m]> no, it uses winit + skia (via skia rust bindings)
[19:17:32] <neovim[m]> the problem with stuff like iced is I don't think you can really get a Vulkan/OpenGL/etc. context, which is what I want
[19:20:14] <neovim[m]> so I'm thinking to do what I want and cross-platform I need GLFW + Vulkan, and either use ImGUI for the UI elements (which can actually look pretty nice, à la uivonim UI elements), or roll my own thing directly with vulkan
[19:21:59] <det0x[m]> that's a great roadmap
[19:22:11] <neovim[m]> if I can pull it off, at least ;)
[19:22:23] <det0x[m]> when https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/master/wgpu says  `wgpu supports most modern graphics backends: Vulkan, Metal, DX11, and DX12 (OpenGL and WebGL are still WIP).`, is this not enough?
[19:22:47] <neovim[m]> > Text, which is rendered using wgpu_glyph. No shaping at all.
[19:22:59] <neovim[m]> so not really giving me the low-level control I want
[19:23:04] <neovim[m]> maybe it'd be fast enough but idk
[19:23:14] <neovim[m]> also no shaping sounds like no ligatures/more complex text
[19:23:31] <p00f[m]> there used to be a "peek definition" snippet in the lspconfig wiki, it doesn't work anymore. What is the new way to do it?
[19:23:43] <det0x[m]> that's right, i see
[19:24:50] <neovim[m]> also there are the limitations at the bottom there, which eh it's probably fine, but I kind of want to do the rendering stuff myself
[19:25:00] <neovim[m]> s/also there are the limitations at the bottom there, which eh it's probably fine, but I kind of want to do the rendering stuff myself/also there are the limitations at the bottom there, which eh it's _probably_ fine, but I kind of want to do the rendering stuff myself anyways/

[23:15:20] <gegoune[m]> Hey, does anyone know if latest updates to cmp (cmdline support) allow for accepting preselected item to be picked by CR? For example, if I type `:pasy` only item on the list is `PackerSync`, but pressing CR then actually executes `pasy`, which doesn't exist.
