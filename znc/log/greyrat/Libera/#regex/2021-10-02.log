[06:12:33] <digitok> that shouldn't be the result of using findall with your regex
[06:12:54] <SteveR> oh
[06:14:46] <digitok> re.findall(r'\b\w{3}\b', 'cat bat rat')
[06:14:55] <digitok> assuming python
[06:15:49] <SteveR> that works

[06:19:08] <digitok> looks like it's just the first word on each line?
[06:21:01] <SteveR> yes
[06:22:09] <digitok> for l in s.split("\n"):
[06:22:09] <digitok>     print(l.split(" ")[0])
[06:22:16] <digitok> i'm no python expert, but that seems to work
[06:22:20] <digitok> s = your string
[06:23:09] <SteveR> yes i was able to do that
[06:23:17] <SteveR> i wanted to know how to do from regex
[06:24:52] <digitok> re.findall(r'(?m)^\S+',s)
[06:26:36] <SteveR> sure that works, but can i know what this regex does digitok
[06:27:07] <digitok> (?m) is an inline modifier which is the same as the python re.MULTILINE option
[06:27:22] <digitok> it allows ^ to match at the start of each line as opposed to the start of the string
[06:27:44] <digitok> \S+ matches 1 or more chars that aren't \s, that is, whitespace
[06:28:42] <digitok> so you could also write it as re.findall(r'^\S+',s,re.MULTILINE)

[06:47:06] <SteveR> can you tell me how to learn regex
[06:47:10] <SteveR> i find its hard
[06:49:03] <maroon> i find it hard too, and there's a lot of it i dont know. it helps to learn the simple parts until you understand them, then add more later
[06:50:15] <maroon> part of the problem is that once you've learned what ? and * mean in wildcards, they have completely different meaning in regex

[07:02:52] <maroon> i find it help best by getting a regex that does something that you need to do, and make sure you understand how it works. the side panel at regex101 has a step-mode that explains what's happening at each portion of the regex pattern
[07:04:50] <SteveR> i see
[07:06:53] <SteveR> maroon https://regex101.com/r/kSjzK1/1
[07:06:58] <SteveR> i see it doesnt do anything over here
[07:08:45] <maroon> it's because you put things into the 'pattern' box that are part of a scripting language, but aren't actually the pattern https://regex101.com/r/kSjzK1/2
[07:09:45] <maroon> so once you have the pattern working correctly, you can click on the language php/python/etc and then click code-generator

[16:03:35] <SlimmyJimmy> I have a file with 1468 lines on Windows they all end with /r/n. This expression, \r\n gets a count of 1468 but \r\n$ gets a count of only 343 matches. How it is possible that a \r\n combination is not at the end of every line anyway. There's really no other place it could be...is there?
[16:09:44] <Me-me> \r\n$ is looking for the end of the line after the newline - it's counting empty lines.
[16:10:41] <digitok> correct, \r$\n should give you 1468
[16:11:08] <digitok> or $\r\n depending on where it's being used and how newlines are configured
[16:11:22] <digitok> assuming windows, probably the latter
[16:15:55] <SlimmyJimmy> Thank You. I always thought that the literal end of the line with the character combination.
[16:19:43] <SlimmyJimmy> It's weird though because notepad plus plus shows them as CRLF
[16:27:28] <purplex> SlimmyJimmy: which language/flavor is it?
[16:29:19] <purplex> right, must be notepad, \r\n$ won't match anything but last \r\n in pcre

[16:58:41] <SlimmyJimmy> Oh hi, yes, it's Notepad++
[16:58:50] <SlimmyJimmy> So, whatever it uses.
[16:59:13] <SlimmyJimmy> Not the Microsoft notepad of course because it doesn't even support regular expressions.
[16:59:26] <Me-me> Not with that attitude.
[17:00:11] <Me-me> Or any other attitude. It actually doesn't.
