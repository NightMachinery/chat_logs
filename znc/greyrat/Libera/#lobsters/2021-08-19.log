[01:12:20] <drobilla> I'd be a lot more inclined to donate to Wikipedia (again) if it weren't for this clickbaitey garbage
[01:12:27] <edk> yeah
[01:12:53] <edk> i've donated once in my life so i just think i'm obviously better than 98% of people and that's good enough for now

[18:30:10] <JordiGH> but!
[18:30:38] <JordiGH> windows exe is a no-go and macOS pkg is a xar file. Which theoretically I could decompress on GNU/loonix
[18:31:02] <JordiGH> Except that xar is an abandoned project and only Apple maintains it now and they only make sure that xar builds on Apple things.
[18:31:09] <companion_cube> so there is a git9??
[18:31:11] <ngoldbaum> why is the windows exe a no-go? can’t you use wine or proton?

[18:32:39] <JordiGH> It's really weird how git users think that the purpose of the staging area is to split up your commits. Nah, the purpose of the staging area is to be annoying and get in the way. You don't need it for splitting up commits.
[18:33:08] <companion_cube> I wonder, is it compatible with git?
[18:33:13] <companion_cube> storage/network wise
[18:33:37] <cot> I believe it is
[18:34:05] <cot> I think the author mentioned somewhere that they used it for repos that were otherwise hosted on GH?
[18:34:54] <indigo> Yeah… after using hg I realized that the staging area concept is dumb
[18:35:50] <riv> i dont even understand how it works :/

[18:36:10] <riv> i just know that i have to type git status, git add, git commit and if I did something bad, git rebase -i
[18:36:43] <cot> Same here -- I'm one of those thick-skulled users that thought that the git index was for partial commits :|
[18:36:55] <saffaffi> i mean, i pretty heavily use `git add -p` to split up commits in the staging area... sure, i could maybe do it another way but that's pretty convenient
[18:37:27] <saffaffi> i might be missing the point
[18:37:39] <riv> ive never heard of git index
[18:37:46] <JordiGH> I mean, I think you do need the staging area in the git CLI to split up commits, but splitting commits in the abstract does not fundamentally require a cache/index/staging area.
[18:37:51] <riv> maybe knowing about this will help me understand git better
[18:38:01] <JordiGH> riv: The index is the same thing as the staging area.
[18:38:09] <JordiGH> Linus called it a cache at first.
[18:38:14] <JordiGH> Then I think Junio renamed it to index.
[18:38:21] <JordiGH> Then the users renamed it to staging area.
[18:38:24] <JordiGH> Something like that.
[18:40:21] <companion_cube> curious, in hg, what would be the equivalent of `git add <newfile>`?
[18:40:24] <riv> 'index' is an absolutely terrible name for this
[18:40:28] <companion_cube> do you have to commit it immediately?
[18:40:42] <JordiGH> companion_cube: it is `hg add`.
[18:40:55] <companion_cube> but is there a notion of … well… staging area for new files?
[18:40:56] <JordiGH> That indicates that file will now be tracked.
[18:40:58] <companion_cube> to be part of the next commit?
[18:41:06] <JordiGH> If the file is already tracked, you don't have to tell hg to track its changes again.
[18:41:30] <companion_cube> ah I see. it's tracked adn the "previous version" would just be the empty file I guess
[18:41:40] <cb> as people mentioned what you could do is the inverse: stash the stuff you don't want to be commited, commit, then pop your temporary shit back
[18:42:04] <riv> i usually just do git commit .
[18:42:10] <JordiGH> hg has `--interactive` for splitting various things.
[18:42:11] <epilys> git add -p
[18:42:11] <riv> i don't keep lots of temporary stuff around
[18:42:22] <riv> git add . i meant
[18:42:27] <cb> usually i try to keep my changes minimal and one at a time
[18:42:28] <JordiGH> It's like `git add -p` but with a nice curses interface.
[18:42:32] <epilys> with -p you add hunks, not files
[18:42:40] <JordiGH> You can split hunks and files with -i
[18:42:41] <riv> so do i
[18:42:44] <JordiGH> In hg.
[18:42:47] <cb> what'd be nice is the hg UI but on git backend
[18:42:55] <JordiGH> cb: hgit exists
[18:43:00] <cb> so you can avoid the caked with shit toilet and use the mercurial bidet
[18:44:00] <JordiGH> I like that we've agreed in the prevailing metaphor source control metaphor that the we code we write is human excrement
