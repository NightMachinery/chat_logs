[00:00:24] <zarakshR> la_mettrie: There is a rustc package
[00:02:08] *** Quits: karma (uid506774@id-506774.tooting.irccloud.com) ()
[00:04:25] <la_mettrie> afaik they are pretty different kind of solutions (rustc vs. rustup). you should get a picture which one suits better for your needs
[00:06:44] *** Joins: brickfat (~brickfat@user/brickfat)
[00:07:11] <zarakshR> OK. Thanks
[00:07:19] <brickfat> why keyboard layout changes periodically? i use my debian from xrdp, windows involves that?
[00:07:32] <brickfat> i dont use keyboard switch keys
[00:07:38] <PMT> It doesn't do that for many people.
[00:07:44] <la_mettrie> zarakshR: rustc is mostly a compiler while rustup gives you a wider environment... i think people usually go with rustup
[00:08:15] <zarakshR> OK. I'm just trying out rust so I think I'll stick with rustc
[00:08:19] *** Quits: zarakshR (~Thunderbi@43.224.128.33) (Quit: zarakshR)
[00:09:10] <PMT> I mean, the question is between distro packages and rustup - you end up with at least one rustc either way.

[00:35:14] <forgotmynick> there is a long standing bug in php < 8 where the syslog.ident is not passed which i am trying to get around if it's possible. i have multiple php fpm master processes running as each respective non-root user and rsyslog sending all logs to a database. is there anyway to capture the user of the process that sent the entry? as far as i can tell there aren't any that i can use 
[00:35:14] <forgotmynick> https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/properties.html 
[00:40:11] <Khepra> forgotmynick: two things. journald tracks UID, so maybe you can use that. the other is via pool names. pool name is logged by PHP master, and if you assing UID specific pool name, then that's how you track them. that's how I track them

[02:05:00] <sney> wasn't that user from last week or so who couldn't update their bios because the mfg utility needed to install a windows driver to start the update using an acer? 
[02:05:11] <sney> that was particularly bad.
[02:08:23] <Khepra> who?
[02:08:26] <PMT> There was a user with an Acer that the vendor just supplied a Windows EXE for, I believe.
[02:08:37] <PMT> Their username was "uefibios", if they're the one I'm thinking of.
[02:08:52] <Khepra> wasn't that lenovo?
[02:09:08] <Khepra> I think that was lenovo because I remember praising acer again :))
[02:09:10] <PMT> They explicitly said their laptop was an Acer Aspire mumble, so I don't think so.
[02:09:25] <Khepra> pshaw!
[02:11:04] <Khepra> ah yes the lenovo one was about efi failure to boot anything but /EFI/Boot
[02:13:25] <PMT> That one was kinda strange in what they were saying.
[02:15:01] <sney> right, the windows exe one. the windows exe contained some cat inf and dll files, in other words a driver, which I guess the utility would then use to write the update to the efi volume 
[02:15:13] <sney> I'm sure it had a nice progress bar :P
[02:15:26] <PMT> That used to be quite common. I'm surprised to see it much now.

[05:50:46] <tharkun> pandoxer: pressing it twice is the way to do it since it is usually a modifier for vowels in spanis and I believe also for some consonants on other languages (that is my speculation)

[06:31:41] <mentor> pandoxer: Your keyboard layout has those bits of punctuation set as "dead keys"; i.e., they modify the next key pressed after them. This is separate from compose key sequences. You should change your layout.

[06:37:39] <pandoxer> mentor, hmm. do you have any idea of what kind of layout I'm looking for here? 
[06:38:11] <mentor> pandoxer: "International" variants often have dead keys assigned on them
[06:38:26] <mentor> I think
[06:38:59] *** Quits: blotto37 (~SnowWhite@user/snowwhite) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[06:39:04] <mentor> pandoxer: Gnome usually has a way to view a schematic of the layout
[06:39:28] <pandoxer> there's a "Portuguese (Brazil, no dead keys)" layout which in fact lets me type out the tilde. but now I cant use it as a modifier for valid characteres haha
[06:40:37] <mentor> pandoxer: You could use compose key sequences
[06:41:16] <mentor> pandoxer: The dead keys normally give you the character in question if you press them twice
[06:42:12] <mentor> pandoxer: A dead key layout may also put the non-dead key version on a differen level, if you assign a level shift key
[06:42:40] <pandoxer> I see
[06:43:07] <pandoxer> mentor, do you think the behavior I'm looking for is possible, though? Or should I give up on trying to achieve it?
[06:43:36] <pandoxer> the behavior being: ~ followed by valid characters (such as a, o, n, etc) produce the proper modified letter
[06:44:01] <pandoxer> ~ followed by / or . or any other invalid character produce the ~/, ~. etc 
[06:44:53] <mentor> I'm pretty sure the engine used to process these things doesn't allow for that
[06:45:15] <mentor> I vaguely remember looking at it
[06:45:51] <mentor> It could still be done, but it requires a bit of a rewrite
[06:45:54] <mentor> I think
[06:46:35] <pandoxer> I switch between OSes frequently and this is one of the things that I get mixed up all the time

[06:48:13] <mentor> Yeah, and the lack of feedback that you've hit a dead key is also an omission
[06:48:44] <pandoxer> is just wanted to give my muscle memory an easy time :<
[06:49:12] <pandoxer> to make things worse my personal MBP is also a different physical layout, so it's the US tilde below the esc key

[12:47:49] <jelly> !wwbr
[12:47:49] <dpkg> Debian "Bullseye" is the current testing branch as of 2019-07-06 and it will be released "when it's ready." Release day we're working to currently - as discussed in various mailing lists is August 14th 2021. There's a hard freeze from July 17th with only the most urgent security fixes after that date. The main CD builder died - all disks failed at once, so the current target is August 14th, or even later.

[21:09:13] <jhutchins> brickfat: It's very unlikely to be a hack, probably just a config file overwritten.
[21:09:51] <Walex> PMT: all extent based in one way (segment breaking), and all of them in another (randomization) and on some it can be incredibly expensive (compresses Btrfs for example).

[21:11:42] <Walex> with 1) '--sparse' is pointless, and that's the typical case on most UNIX systems.
[21:12:40] <Walex> 2) files with gaps between data records, often written and read randomly in small bits, in-place. Typically disk images, DBMS stores.
[21:13:31] <Walex> With 2) '--sparse' works, but but there are two bad cases with 2)
[21:14:34] <Walex> 2.1): files are stores in segments, and each record means a small segment, or updates-in-place create small segments. Since segment implementation are designed to be large, that is not so good.
[21:16:04] <Walex> 2.2) even if 2.1 does not happen, support you have a file composes of segments that are "sparse", and the file is copied. Odds are that all the segments in the file will be allocated sequentially. Then any new added segments will be allocated potentially far away from other related records, and fragmentation will increase a lot.

[21:17:19] <brickfat> jhutchins overlapping config files... i'm going to install windows
[21:18:48] <Walex> There are many corner cases: for example a little known feature of XFS is that it loads and locks the entire segment table in memory when a file is opened, on the assumption that a file is usually composed of a few large segment. This is particularly bad with slowly written log files or much updated and grown disk images and DBMS storage files.

[21:19:31] *** Joins: furrymcgee (~devuan@31.179.186.66)
[21:20:40] <Walex> A big advantage of sparse files is that at the beginning they look extremely cost effective, even in cases 2.1 and 2.2 above, and most projects are only assessed on their initial impression.
[21:21:28] <dob1> my question was really more simple: yesterday I was not able to copy data from one partition to another with rsync because of sparse file. PMT and Khepra explained me the reason and I used --sparse and it worked. but if it was not for the space problem I was not aware of this and I was wasting maybe a lot of space after copying the data
[21:21:53] <Walex> Then someone like me gets called in and has to unf@ck the whole thing. E.g. a disk image file that had grown to have 1.6 million segments...
[21:21:55] <dob1> without the --sparse
[21:23:43] <Walex> dob1: if your don't care about potential space/time/memory tradeoffs, one can use '--sparse' all the time.
[21:24:38] <dob1> it makes sense

[21:25:25] <Walex> in some favourable cases '--sparse' may be even faster.

[22:54:35] *** Quits: ice9 (~ice9@user/ice9) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[22:55:20] <amacater> Which devices particularly?
[22:55:21] <PMT> Intel makes a lot of devices, you'd need to be a bit more specific, as well as specifying which version of Debian.
[22:55:45] <sney> mattb0ne: if the computer is newer than 2019 and you're using debian 10, you may need a newer kernel 
[22:56:03] <mattb0ne> my integrated graphics 
[22:56:09] <mattb0ne> and my ethernet card 
[22:56:21] <mattb0ne> I am not sure if the HW is bleeding edge or not 
[22:56:41] <sney> google says 10th gen intel for that model, I would try the buster-backports 5.10 kernel 
[22:56:52] <mattb0ne> ok 
[22:57:06] <mattb0ne> that is the name of the package in apt?
[22:57:13] <mattb0ne> do I need to add a source 
[22:57:44] <sney> !buster-backports
[22:57:44] <dpkg> Some packages intended for Bullseye (Debian 11) but recompiled for use with Buster (Debian 10) can be found in the buster-backports repository. See http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/ . Ask me about <bdo>, <backports>.
[22:58:03] <sney> ^ then the package is linux-image-amd64

[22:58:54] <mattb0ne> ok cool I will give this a shot
[22:59:42] <sney> make sure to note that you have to specify buster-backports when you install the package, otherwise apt will tell you it's already the latest version. backports are only installed when apt is explicitly told to do so. 
[23:00:36] <mattb0ne> right I was getting that when I was trying to update the xserver-xorg-video-intel stuff
[23:00:40] <mattb0ne> hoepfully this will help 
[23:00:49] <mattb0ne> hopefully*
[23:01:19] <amacater> Be aware that Debian 11 will be released relatively soon with up to date kernels and so on ...
[23:01:38] <mattb0ne> define soon? weeks, months?
[23:01:48] <PMT> !wwbr
[23:01:48] <dpkg> Debian "Bullseye" is the current testing branch as of 2019-07-06 and it will be released "when it's ready." Release day we're working to currently - as discussed in various mailing lists is August 14th 2021. There's a hard freeze from July 17th with only the most urgent security fixes after that date. The main CD builder died - all disks failed at once, so the current target is August 14th, or even later.
[23:01:50] <amacater> August 14th if all goes wel
[23:02:07] <sney> maybe less than one month, but I'm not convinced we didn't jinx it by saying july 31st over and over 
[23:02:19] <mattb0ne> lol
[23:02:30] <amacater> mattb0ne: Do you have any firmware installed?
[23:02:40] <sney> somewhere between 3 and 8 weeks 
[23:03:01] <mattb0ne> no firmware I was looking to try and install that non-free stuff
[23:03:06] <mattb0ne> to see if that would help 
[23:03:14] <mattb0ne> I am going to paste bin my specific HW

[23:04:14] <sney> AFAIK there are no current intel wired ethernet nics that require firmware, occasionally one of the enterprise versions will use a blob for extra server features but that shouldn't be relevant for a desktop 
[23:04:21] <sney> i915 does need firmware sometimes though. 
[23:04:47] <mattb0ne> was weird since the live CD appeared to work 
[23:04:52] <amacater> intel-microcode may well be worthwhile
[23:05:07] <mattb0ne> but I think something was up since I was using SW rendering 
[23:05:12] <amacater> Ah ... do you end up with a black screen?
[23:05:17] <mattb0ne> after install i just get the black screen

[23:10:33] <amacater> If it works - fine - otherwise, you might want to try to install Debian 11 directly in due course.
