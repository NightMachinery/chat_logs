[02:08:11] <pushcx> I read it as saying it's trying to set 'rx', but I'm not sure. I wonder if it's possible this is fallout from when I started puma as root, maybe I did a 'git pull' as root and some random file is still owned by root? I'm searching with 'find'.

[21:57:16] <constxd> kings! question
[21:57:51] <constxd> suppose a programming language allows functions to return multiple values
[21:58:19] <constxd> let a, b = f(x);
[21:58:37] <technomancy> =(
[21:58:46] <constxd> why sad
[21:59:16] <technomancy> because multiple values are just a really shitty form of data structure, and first-class data structures are much better
[21:59:24] <constxd> yes that is what i was getting to
[21:59:38] <technomancy> ah ok, continue =)
[22:00:16] <constxd> well i was going to ask, how do you make such a construct play nicely with other language features in a composable way
[22:00:32] <constxd> like xs.map(f)
[22:00:54] <constxd> if f returned a proper "pair" type this would be fine, but it doesn't
[22:01:11] <constxd> so any values returned beyond the first are just kind of lost
[22:01:35] <momcorp> In what language? Can't you "repack" the returned values in a tuple?
[22:01:42] <technomancy> if you have destructuring/pattern-matching you should just make "return a list" the only way to implement returning multiple values.
[22:01:50] <technomancy> let (a, b) = f();
[22:02:26] <technomancy> it's the only way to retain consistent semantics and the convenience simultaneously IMO
[22:02:35] <riv> it's very difficult to optimize away the creation and destruction of the container though, because it happens across a function boundary
[22:03:17] <constxd> yes the reason i initially wanted multiple return values was to avoid actually creating these objects, and also because sometimes you don't care about the other values
[22:03:37] <technomancy> you have to choose between good semantics and performance
[22:03:56] <constxd> for example if you have an iterator object, it's __next__ method may "return x, i;" so that you can consume it like this
[22:04:01] <constxd> for x, i in foo { ... }
[22:04:01] *** Joins: amazigh (~amirouche@user/amirouche)
[22:04:03] <riv> multiple return values can make sense semantically, if you think about returning as calling a continuation. mvs are just putting multiple values into a contintuation
[22:04:14] <constxd> but sometimes you don't care about the index and you should be able to write for x in foo { ... }
[22:04:15] <riv> alternatively, just leaving 2 things on a stack instead of 1
[22:04:31] <technomancy> riv: granted if the stack is a first-class construct in your language then absolutely
[22:05:28] <technomancy> speaking as someone with extensive experience implementing a compiler on the lua runtime, lua's multivalues are by far the largest source of headaches and bugs in the compiler.
[22:05:42] <constxd> but at the end of the day
[22:06:01] <constxd> do they make programming in lua easier?
[22:06:19] <technomancy> constxd: they do, but only because lua doesn't implement pattern matching, which is another enormous mistake
[22:06:51] <constxd> i extended my pattern matching to support like
[22:07:14] <constxd> pseudo-lists because there is no proper list type
[22:07:50] <technomancy> "there is no proper list type" <- ok it sounds like you've got something really unusual going on, and I hesitate to advise much further without knowing why there's no lists, lmao
[22:08:01] <constxd> http://paste.pr0.tips/rc
[22:08:58] <constxd> see there you are matching on multiple values simultaneously, but (k % 3, k % 5) is not itself an actual value
[22:09:05] <constxd> nor are (0, 0), etc..
[22:09:24] <technomancy> I mean like ... is your argument that it's cool to have data structures that aren't first-class?
[22:09:33] <technomancy> because I have a really hard time accepting that
[22:09:50] <constxd> no i don't have an argument, i have a problem
[22:09:58] <technomancy> haha sure
[22:10:06] <constxd> and i think it's that data structures that aren't first-class are NOT cool
[22:10:32] <constxd> and now i don't know how to fix it
[22:11:03] <technomancy> I guess you must have some reason you can't replace them with first-class data structures
[22:11:09] <technomancy> don't keep us in the dark =)
[22:11:19] *** Joins: cwett (~cwett@172.58.43.35)
[22:12:30] <constxd> no i don't, but at this point it would require a bit of work. also there is the fact that right now if you don't care about the additional return values you can generally just treat the function call expression as a single value which can be convenient
[22:12:56] <constxd> basically i am just looking for input / ideas before i commit to abandoning multiple return values
[22:13:00] <constxd> and adding tuples
[22:13:33] <technomancy> silently discarding unbound values is one of those convenience vs clarity tradeoffs
[22:13:54] <technomancy> the longer I spend programming, the more firmly I land in the clarity side =)
[22:14:22] *** Quits: cwett_ (~cwett@172.58.43.225) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[22:14:37] <technomancy> let (x) = f(); is only slightly noisier, and it conveys to the reader that there are multiple values there you *could* bind, if you're interested. IMO that's a win
[22:14:37] <bkero> It sounds like you actually need to work with other people.
[22:15:00] *** Quits: rickybob (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:15:14] <constxd> so you think (x) should match (4, 5, 6)?
[22:15:19] <technomancy> or if you want to be more strict, requiring let (x, _) = f(); is an option too depending on the semantics of your language
[22:15:53] <constxd> was thinking (x, *_) if you want to match regardless of how many values f returns
[22:15:55] <technomancy> constxd: it does in my language but it might not be the best choice in other languages
[22:16:07] <constxd> can i see your language

[22:17:07] <technomancy> a few =)
[22:18:01] <technomancy> but fennel admittedly lies on the "sloppy" side of this divide due to runtime things outside our control, like nil

[22:20:47] <constxd> i like sloppy
[22:21:30] <technomancy> if you like sloppy then I guess you should allow (x) to match (3, 4 5) =)
[22:21:36] <technomancy> problem is it's a lot easier to go from strict
[22:21:42] <technomancy> *strict->sloppy than the other way around
[22:22:52] *** Joins: pyrorock (~Dont@46.136.13.72)
[22:23:05] <constxd> only issue with that is
[22:23:19] <ngoldbaum> also it gets parsed as (3, 45) on even-numbered line numbers and (3, 4, 5) otherwise
[22:23:51] <constxd> match [1, 2, 3] { [x] => x, [x, y, z] => f(x, y, z) }
[22:24:02] <constxd> wouldn't you expect that to take the second branch

[22:24:20] <Church> This is taking so long
[22:24:52] <technomancy> constxd: in fennel how you'd do that is you'd make the first branch match [x, nil]
[22:25:11] <technomancy> constxd: but it's pretty normal with pattern matching to require you to put the most-specific branches first

[22:32:30] <riv> looking at some compiler output, rust returns multiple results in registers
[22:32:37] <riv> and probably something special after it runs out of return regs
[22:32:57] <riv> so even though it has the type of a pair of values, it avoid packing and unpacking it
