[00:03:02] <epilys> read some classics and you'll find the "THING was better before" is a constant theme in human complaining
[00:05:01] <Brekkjern> Absolutely, but my point was that it impacts the policy of the site
[00:05:50] <epilys> re: 'hackers', I agree
[00:06:14] <Brekkjern> The number of posts about hacking on old-shit hardware and exalting how it's so much better than modern computing makes people believe that shit like behind the scenes photos of the Hackers movie is on-topic because "We all grew up with this and it was the best thing ever, and nothing new is as good as this!"

[00:18:51] <buttsbot> They really have a problem with one and not the other : TikTokCringe
[01:41:11] <Brekkjern> Man... GraphQL is honestly pretty neat
[01:41:26] <Brekkjern> There's some inertia to figuring it out, but after that it's really nice.
[02:07:52] <cb> Church: how old are you?
[02:07:59] <Church> 25
[02:07:59] <cb> i think i'm right on the millenial-zoomer border
[02:08:11] <cb> i'm uhhhh 23 i think
[02:08:39] <Church> Yeah think I am as well last I checked?
[02:08:47] <Church> Was like '95-96 was the border
[02:09:28] <Brekkjern> >Researchers and popular media use the mid-to-late 1990s as starting birth years and the early 2010s as ending birth years.
[02:10:55] <Brekkjern> >As the first social generation to have grown up with access to the Internet and portable digital technology from a young age, members of Generation Z have been dubbed "digital natives",[4][5] even though they are not necessarily digitally literate.
[02:10:59] <Brekkjern> Wikipedia throwing shade :P
[02:12:39] <jjuran> Hackers is showbiz, not tech
[02:14:29] <jjuran> Of its many scenes purporting to illustrate hacking, the only realistic one is the montage of several folks spending hours staring at screens and printouts and eating pizza
[02:14:42] <jjuran> During which you don't even see what's on the screen
[02:15:04] <Brekkjern> I was about to comment that it's about as realistic as "That scene from NCIS"
[02:16:12] <jjuran> We need a way to schedule who's going to make what comments in IRC
[02:16:36] <jjuran> I'll go make a GUI for that in Visual Basic
[02:17:35] <jjuran> Wait, never mind — GDPR says I can't, because it captures IP addresses
[02:20:35] <gerikson> lol @ HN for toning down the title here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27941845
[02:20:36] <buttsbot> Problems with Python | Hacker News
[02:24:10] <Brekkjern> I love how the author doesn't even know that the self keyword only is "self" by convention. If they want to, they could call it "I_Dont_Understand_The_Language_But_I_Have_Opinions_Anyway" and it would work just as fine.
[02:24:51] <Brekkjern> Nor do they know about dataclasses which would do the heavy lifting for them
[02:25:57] <Brekkjern> >In general, when you point out any flaws in their language, Python developers will act hostile and condescending.
[02:25:57] <Brekkjern> Mostly because the author is an idiot.
[02:37:29] <Brekkjern> Holy shit. TIL: Holding ctrl while in Task Manager on Windows will pause updating values. Holding F5 will increase the update rate.
[02:51:47] <jjuran> Neat.  It's quite annoying to try to follow what's going in htop sometimes.
[02:53:51] <Brekkjern> Screep looks pretty neat
[03:08:08] <skyl4rk> huh didn't know that about task mgr
[03:09:01] <skyl4rk> bit sour about it getting in a [not responding] state close to boot up when lots of system? processes are doing update checks or w/e
[03:09:26] <skyl4rk> at least that's what I think is happening but how can I now, you had /one job/ task mgr!
[04:14:15] <Brekkjern> >Having a bunch of non-lawyers second-guessing a different bunch of non-lawyers attempting a business goal is not gonna be a great discussion, or even an especially topical one.
[04:14:18] <Brekkjern> lol
[04:14:46] <Brekkjern> push doesn't seem to want to watch the bullshit :P
[04:28:51] <Brekkjern> Aparently there might have been a meteor that landed over Oslo like 30 minutes ago or so
[04:29:04] <Brekkjern> I didn't notice at all...
[04:30:23] <Brekkjern> According to the news it was loud
[04:33:43] <ngoldbaum> wow big bolide cool
[04:33:55] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: it probably exploded in the upper atmosphere
[04:33:59] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[04:34:07] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: if it didn’t break windows it wasn’t very big
[04:34:10] <Brekkjern> Reports from pretty much the entirety of southern norway
[04:34:23] <Brekkjern> It rattled some windows, but I don't think anyone has reported damages
[04:34:48] <ngoldbaum> the chelyabinsk meteor broke windows across hundreds of kilometers of territory in siberia
[04:34:55] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[04:35:00] <ngoldbaum> and tungutska leveled a forest…
[04:35:06] <ngoldbaum> lucky norway!
[04:35:19] <Brekkjern> Yep
[04:35:51] <Brekkjern> I remember when Chelyabinsk happened. Everyone was expecting a meteor to pass Earth that day in an orbit inside the moons orbit
[04:35:55] <Brekkjern> And that one hit around the same time
[04:39:17] <ngoldbaum> i wonder what a meteor coming in over norway looks like to russian early warning radar
[04:39:33] <ngoldbaum> i guess it’s going way way faster than an icbm
[04:39:50] <Brekkjern> Whatever it looks like, I don't think it was an early enough warning :P

[22:02:09] <Church> Hadn't noticed heh.
[22:02:17] <drakonis> yes, exactly
[22:02:25] <drakonis> that's exactly the problem
[22:02:59] <Church> Heh
[22:03:02] <Church> Ouch
[22:03:22] <Church> Actually wait that's kinda weird... I made an installer less then a month ago.
[22:04:42] <drakonis> it slipped into a release because the install isn't checked for regressions
[22:05:18] <Church> Awesome
[22:05:23] <Church> Brought this up on matrix?
[22:06:42] <drakonis> there's already an open issue on nixpkgs
[22:06:54] <drakonis> but there hasnt been much progress in figuring out a permanent fix
[22:07:26] <drakonis> while i don't use nixos anymore, it has taken a bit too long to get fixed
