[12:42:37] <Earnestly> Random oddity.  gawk, using split() with seps array.  Want to preserve separators, printf "%s%s", arr[i], sep[i].  But when sep[i] = ", " it produces output without the space.  To fix this I used: printf "%s%s", arr[i], (sep[i] : ", " ? ", ") which seems odd
[12:43:43] <Earnestly> Hm, sep[i+1] can also work
[12:59:18] <Earnestly> # print +0000 | awk '{print $1}'
[12:59:20] <shbot> Earnestly: +0000
[12:59:23] <Earnestly> # print +0000 | gawk '{print $1}'
[12:59:25] <shbot> Earnestly: +0000
[13:05:37] <Earnestly> It's a shame, gawk's switch case cannot do: case (i in arr): 
[13:06:25] <Earnestly> Can't even: case arr[i]: or case (arr[i]):
[13:09:24] <Earnestly> Oh well, good old if else tree does better job and is portable
[13:10:24] <user51> Earnestly: i imagine you tried it but just in case: http://sprunge.us/UfmoHW
[13:11:04] <Earnestly> Yeah, it is fair enough.  The documentation does say 'value or regex', and not expression
[13:12:02] <Earnestly> user51: I still have a problem though, trying to bodge together a date to strptime parser and for some reason it's not matching +0000: https://0x0.st/oXJN.bin
[13:12:22] <Earnestly> user51: You can try it on this input: https://0x0.st/oXJq.txt
[13:12:58] <Earnestly> It works for zones which match -dddd
[13:14:38] <Earnestly> And I'm not sure why, I'm not sure if gawk is doing something weird to it or if it's logic mistake
[13:18:40] <user51> maybe change [-+] to something else
[13:19:12] <Earnestly> I have tried "-[0-9]{4}" with not much luck
[13:20:08] <Earnestly> user51: I think it's if(!d) doing it
[13:20:24] <Earnestly> Added a print statement to that branch and +0000 appears to show up there
[13:21:10] <Earnestly> Yup, changing that to if(d == "") fixes it
[13:24:17] <Earnestly> Nice it works with everything I've gont
[13:24:20] <Earnestly> got*

[18:07:23] <Patsie> didn't know that using arrays had such a performance impact -> https://patsie.nl/metaball-test.png
[18:08:04] <Patsie> only difference is that a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, etc have been renamed to a[1], a[2], a[3], etc
[18:08:36] <Patsie> variables are called and (re)calculated a lot of times in the million(s)
[18:08:50] <Patsie> but yeah, big impact
[18:13:03] <Earnestly> Probably because they're not really arrays
[18:13:06] <Earnestly> But hash tables
[18:13:23] <Earnestly> So you get O(1) access, but the constant-time cost is much higher

[19:01:28] <Patsie> especially in calculation
[19:05:11] <Patsie> but yeah, it means that I'm not easily going to make this variable multi-metaballs without quite some performance impact :( gotta stick with them basic variables
[19:32:00] <Patsie> seems like gawk 5.0.0 had some performance anxiety -> https://patsie.nl/metaball-test2.png
