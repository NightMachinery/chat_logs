[07:20:03] <runrin> has anyone experienced issues with vim's auto indent in the middle of a C comment?
[07:20:14] <runrin> https://i.imgur.com/OxlRuCc.gif
[07:20:28] <runrin> here is a gif of me pressing `o` and it's behavior is changing
[07:23:14] <igemnace> runrin: sort of seems like your shiftwidth might be larger than expected. check your :set shiftwidth? (with the question mark)
[07:23:40] <runrin> it is 8, as expected

[07:26:46] <igemnace> ah. well, i can't reproduce on my vim. what are your indention settings in your vimrc? :filetype indent on, autoindent, smartindent?
[07:27:33] *** Joins: diamondbond (~diamondbo@175.157.205.144)
[07:28:34] <runrin> just filetype indent on
[07:28:43] *** Quits: diamondbond (~diamondbo@175.157.205.144) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:30:29] <runrin> after 70 lines, the comment just decides it really wants to be indented
[07:31:26] <igemnace> ah, after a few lines? can you pastebin the file? might be that vim is failing to find the opening /* and is getting messed up
[07:32:03] <igemnace> can you also try with a minimal setup? --clean, then manually do :filetype indent on?
[07:33:04] <runrin> it happens with --clean too
[07:33:20] <runrin> just an empty .c file with a 70+ line comment
[07:33:44] <runrin> comment starting on line 1, indent starts behaving weirdly on line 71
[07:35:51] <runrin> i just type `/*<enter>/<esc>j` then press `o<esc>` until it breaks
[07:36:33] *** Quits: waveform (~quassel@waveform.plus.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:36:57] <nickspoon> I'm not seeing what you're seeing, but just creating an empty c file and populating it with  /*<CR> and then holding down <CR>, after line 70 the space before each * is dropped, so after line 70 the * is in column 1 instead of column 2
[07:37:13] *** Quits: kitsunenokenja (~kitsunech@68.91.220.96) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[07:38:04] <nickspoon> Same with hitting  `o<Esc>`  70 times
[07:38:07] <runrin> yeah, nick that is what its doing to me too
[07:38:22] <nickspoon> I'm not seeing that big indent in your gif though
[07:38:42] <runrin> yeah, that only happens in my comment with text in it so far
[07:38:56] <runrin> let me try to reproduce it from scratch
[07:40:13] <nickspoon> :h cino-star > runrin 
[07:40:13] <digmbot> runrin: :help cino-star -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/indent.txt.html#cino-star
[07:41:00] <runrin> welp, there you go
[07:41:02] <runrin> thanks!
[07:41:04] <nickspoon> Looks like you can configure this value with cinoptions

[09:22:00] <jaggz> i'm guessing it doesn't handle one-line if's (the elif: foo); it just blindly unindents else: when it sees it (and other stuff maybe)

[21:03:46] <xx> if I only want to apply something in my vimrc when a specific plugin is installed, what's the syntax for that?
[21:03:51] <xx> or what is it called, so that I may find it
[21:04:16] <zeraphel> xx: the standard is for plugins to set a variable like g:loaded_{plugin_name}
[21:04:23] <romainl> define "plugin is installed"
[21:04:30] <habamax> xx, every good plugin has g:loaded_something
[21:05:09] <habamax> yeah, I have some plugins that are installed, but never loaded
[21:05:12] <romainl> "is on the machine"? "is sourced"? "right after it was sourced"? etc.
[21:05:47] <romainl> "installed" is meaningless in Vim
[21:05:55] <xx> can I get some example syntax somewhere?
[21:06:06] <romainl> explain what you want first
[21:06:29] <habamax> I consider plugin installed if it is placed into correct place vim can load it from if needed
[21:06:40] <xx> I want to apply 'map <leader>h :History<CR>' only when https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim is installed
[21:06:43] <habamax> but xx might something different in mind
[21:07:14] <xx> just as an example, I have a whole bunch of plugins, different on different machines, and would like to use just one vimrc for all machines
[21:07:29] <romainl> :h exists(
[21:07:30] <digmbot> :help exists( -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/eval.txt.html#exists%28%29

[21:09:05] <habamax> define simple
[21:09:14] <romainl> and easy too
[21:09:34] <xx> simple means something like: if (vim-fzf = installed) then map ..."

[21:09:56] <xx> exactly

[21:13:48] <habamax> xx, there is no way to check if plugin is installed, until it is loaded
[21:14:08] <romainl> one can explore the filesystem
[21:14:10] <habamax> you can't check if plugin is loaded in your vimrc, cause it is run before that
[21:14:13] <romainl> but well…
[21:14:13] <habamax> romainl: indeed
[21:14:14] <nova> vim don't work like that. You can do :nnoremap <leader>E :call UndefinedFunction()<cr> and define UndefinedFunction() later
[21:14:35] <habamax> nova, but once you run that mapping it will do additional check :)

[21:15:43] <habamax> xx, so in order to check if plugin was loaded you should do those after vimrc was processed and all plugins were sourced
[21:16:11] <habamax> this is usually what .vim/after/ directory is for
[21:16:12] <romainl> and plugins are sourced after the vimrc

[21:17:14] <habamax> be it .vim/plugin or .vim/after/plugin
[21:17:32] <habamax> but with .vim/after/plugin they are sourced kind of *last*
[21:17:49] <habamax> here you can check if plugin was loaded and map you mapping
[21:18:15] <habamax> :if exists(":History") | nnoremap <leader>h :History<CR> | endif
