[00:00:05] <quippy> yeah it's like exec-path-from-shell just completely stopped working for me :(
[00:00:13] <quippy> I can't figure out where it's getting this PATH from because it's completely different than my shell
[00:00:38] <quippy> but $SHELL appears to be the right one, from the view of Emacs
[00:00:48] <quippy> if anybody has a guess it'd be greatly appreciated

[06:00:30] <Hash> Hello, anytime I start emacs or open any file, whitespace mode is always turned on. I have config.el: (setq global-whitespace-mode 0) and (setq whitespace-mode 0)
[06:00:43] <Hash> I can't seem to keep whitespace mode off.
[06:00:48] <bpalmer> so you set the variable to a non-nil value.
[06:00:57] <Hash> Who me?
[06:02:01] <bpalmer> Hash: yes. When the variable whitespace-mode is nil, things will assume it's off and otherwise, assume it's on. 0 is not nil.
[06:02:21] <bpalmer> (in practice, whitespace mode is more complicated than that, so simply setting it to 0 (a non-nil value) won't *actually* turn it on, but it will look like it's on)
[06:03:27] <Hash> Oh
[06:03:37] <SpiderPig> I guess I fixed it. Pinning workgroups2 to melpa-stable did it.  Not exactly sure if it was a change in the way git tags are selected by packages or the workgroups2 github itself..
[06:03:38] <Hash> I don't know how to make non nil sory
[06:03:47] <grym> Hash: sure you do, you've done it 
[06:03:49] <Hash> jsut 'nil?
[06:04:12] <bpalmer> yes, nil is the one nil value in elisp, and 'nil is an unusual way of writing it
[06:04:26] <Hash> Oh. What's the ' quote do?
[06:04:30] <grym> (setq global-whitespace-mode nil) should do it 
[06:04:30] <Hash> I don't even know anything about lisp
[06:04:34] <Hash> Oh ok.
[06:04:43] <Hash> I also see a ' single quote before stuff sometimes
[06:04:55] <bpalmer> (global-whitespace-mode -1)  is the better way
[06:05:15] <bpalmer> whitespace mode involves adding things to a bunch of hooks, so it needs a function to properly enable/disable it.
[06:05:23] <Hash> Ok, this didn't work well, I opened emacs again. and init.el still shows whitespace dots
[06:05:57] <bpalmer> "If called interactively, enable Global Whitespace mode if ARG is positive, and disable it if ARG is zero or negative.  If called from Lisp, also enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if ARG is ‘toggle’; disable the mode otherwise."
[06:06:08] <Hash> it still shows up in xmobarrc, xmoand.hs and other places. It only got turned off in one buffer.
[06:06:24] <bpalmer> Hash: using the function call?
[06:06:26] <twb> Hash: 'x is shorthand for (QUOTE x).  It is a symbolic quote, the same way "x" is a text quote.
[06:06:43] <Hash> I see
[06:06:53] <twb> fsbot: (let ((x 2)) (list x 'x))
[06:06:53] <fsbot> (2 x)  ..(cons)
[06:06:59] <Hash> This only works for the active buffer it seems. It doesn't work on all buffers.
[06:07:08] <twb> fsbot: (let ((x 2)) (list x '(fart fart x fart)))
[06:07:08] <fsbot> (2 (fart fart x fart))  ..(cons)
[06:07:12] <Hash> I still see whitespace on many buffers, even with that setting, and restarting emacs
[06:07:18] <bpalmer> what setting?
[06:07:37] <Hash> 127 (setq global-whitespace-mode nil) and (setq whitespace-mode nil)
[06:07:48] <Hash> -127 (that's line number)
[06:08:00] <bpalmer> <bpalmer> (global-whitespace-mode -1)  is the better way
[06:08:05] <twb> "Automatically becomes buffer-local when set."
[06:08:06] <Hash> Ok
[06:08:26] <Hash> no luck.
[06:08:39] <Hash> Still shows whitespace in buffers when I open emacs. 
[06:08:52] <Hash> Do I need to wipe the desktop file to clear already opened buffers?
[06:09:00] <Hash> Does it only affect newly opened buffers and not existing?
[06:09:31] <Hash> If I do M-x whitespace-mode then for that buffer, whitespace goes away.
[06:09:50] <Hash> But I don't want to have to do it for every buffer. I want it automatically to never display any whitespace dots.
[06:10:23] <bpalmer> it sounds like something is turning it on. Does this happen with _Q ?
[06:10:51] <Hash> No
[06:12:42] <bpalmer> with -q ?
[06:13:22] <Hash> -q is ok too, no whitespace.

[09:49:17] <Hash> what means shallow?
[09:49:20] <thblt> shallow clone have a 1-on-1 association between one remote and one local branch.
[09:49:20] <Hash> not deep enough?
[09:49:27] <Hash> like might hve done --depth 1?
[09:49:29] <thblt> by default.
[09:49:31] <Hash> I can't rememberm

[09:49:43] <sam_> i don't think that's by default though
[09:49:43] <Hash> thanks
[09:49:51] <sam_> shallow clone is specifically about history depth, right
[09:49:55] <sam_> it's not about the refs you pull down
[09:50:00] <Hash> Switched to a new branch 'emacs-27'
[09:50:51] <thblt> sam_: in my experience it defaults to a different remote.NAME.fetch that only syncs the default branch.

[09:53:41] <Hash> I don't use it.

[15:16:29] <gueorgui> It does feel like some external process is not returning what it should be returning and emacs keeps waiting for that. It's not getting stuck at 100% cpu or anything like this.
[15:17:06] <gueorgui> Hence my idea of trying to drop into a debugger to see what the process might be. But not sure how to trigger that...

[18:11:47] <grym> that was nice when i was there for work for several weeks
[18:11:48] <pingpongball> I'm in bspwm.
[18:11:58] <pingpongball> when i was in gnome, that bell worked properly.
[18:12:04] <bkhl> Can't recommend dealing with the Swedish migration agency (looking forward to waiting up to another year for my wife to be able to join me).
[18:12:07] <Bayes> grym yeah I hear ya, on the other hands we already moved latitudes quite a bit and we found that short days and cold weather in the north has actually its charm
[18:12:12] <pingpongball> But switching to bspwm , the bell didnt ring anymore
[18:12:14] <grym> Bayes: for like a week 
[18:12:17] <pingpongball> what should i do guys?

[18:12:47] <Bayes> I don't like summers... nor springs for that matter
[18:12:53] <empwilli> pingpongball: what bell are you refering to? is it probably that your current setup misses a notification service?
[18:12:56] <grym> i like the daylight 
[18:13:08] <pingpongball> (setq ring-bell-function 1)
[18:13:13] <pingpongball> just this had worked in gnome
[18:13:17] <pingpongball> not in bspwm
[18:13:23] <Bayes> bkhl sorry to hear that, most migration agencies are a real PITA
[18:13:24] <grym> "sunset at 22:00, daily highs of 19 C, light breeze, mostly sunny"
[18:13:25] <bkhl> You get the same amount of daylight in Scandinavia as anywhere else.
[18:13:28] <bkhl> Just not evenly distributed.
[18:14:02] <Bayes> I keep hearing lawyers talk wonders about Canada migration policies but in most cases it's a pita
[18:14:13] <grym> that said, i like where i'm at 
[18:14:16] <empwilli> ring-bell-function shoul be a function, why do you set it to 1?
[18:14:24] <Bayes> also no, sunlight is... while I love caving in all day xD
[18:14:40] <pingpongball> empwilli it did worked in previous, i didnt tried,

[18:24:27] <grym> i hate to say this but msft authenticator is ... a lot better

[18:24:54] <Athas> I am not surprised it fails (this is Emacs 24 on an obsolete RHEL), but I am disturbed that it would open a network connection on startup.
[18:25:00] <pingpongball> i mean i've setup like this for custom bell, if it not availalble in my wm
[18:25:02] <Athas> I don't remember having anything like that in my init file.

[18:25:33] <pingpongball> but it didnt worked either
[18:26:11] <Donatzsky> pingpongball: No idea. I don't like having my computer beeping at me, so never have audible bells or similar activated
[18:27:20] <empwilli> pingpongball: even if you now call (ding)? 
[18:27:26] <jbe> Athas: I suggest you start with doing ,,-q
[18:27:26] <fsbot> -q: [0]  runs emacs without user configuration, ideal to test issues caused by your personal config
[18:27:26] <fsbot> [1] If starting emacs with "emacs -q" fixes the problem, it's something in your personal config; check your .emacs. If "emacs -q" has problems but "emacs -Q" doesn't, blame your distro or local admin.
[18:27:26] <fsbot> [2] it's also possible that you have triggered a bug rather than introduced one, but that is rare. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
[18:28:01] <Athas> jbe: actually, --debug-init turned out to be useful.  It looks like use-package was the culprit.

[18:29:26] <Bayes> so, in my IDE there's a tool called "Go to file/function" where you start typing a name and it will match with all the files, functions (and possibly variable names as well?) available in the folder scripts
[18:29:34] *** Parts: intothewild (steve@user/intothewild) (ERC 5.4.1 (IRC client for GNU Emacs 28.0.60))
[18:29:51] <Bayes> so you can quickly move around different files in a project, and it's cool cause it's context sensitive (in the sense that for example you can find functions, not just file names)
[18:29:57] <Bayes> is there anything like that in emacs?
[18:30:12] <grym> Bayes: with LSP, yes
[18:30:19] <Bayes> or is the kind of programming language mode dependent kind of feature?
[18:30:20] <grym> otherwise, it's regex time afaik
[18:30:30] <grym> or one bright day when tree-sitter gets good
[18:31:02] <Donatzsky> imenu can do it for the current file. Perhaps it can be extended to cover the whole project
[18:31:23] <Bayes> hm it's kinda hard to get good regexs for this, I was hoping for something that's more context aware like inemu as Donatzsky mentions
[18:31:34] <grym> if you want to go to a function, you need a thing that knows what functions are, and that's ast time aiui 
[18:31:39] <Donatzsky> dumb-jump is also an option
[18:32:05] <grym> if you want to just fuzzy match on text and trust yourself to pick the functions out of the list, you can do that with some clever regexing

[18:44:21] <krux02> the entire database is just one big text file with creat and insert
[18:44:30] <krux02> INSERT isn't a query
[18:44:36] <grym> krux02: surely you then just ... run sql on the database, then
[18:44:47] <djuber> for sql from mysql dumps the bigger problem is you have 50kb lines of INSERT INTO ... values (long list of values) and that's a different problem

[20:20:14] <pingpongball> but it was working perfectly in gnome, while bspwm it didnt worked
[20:20:14] <thblt> pingpongball: What if you remove :device?
[20:20:53] <pingpongball> it would rather cause more problem, before i wasnt using anydevice, because of not working i used device with many options, but still not working
[20:21:06] <Donatzsky> pingpongball: What happens if you run echo -e "\07" in a terminal?
[20:21:32] <pingpongball> nothing
[20:21:41] <pingpongball> =L
[20:22:03] <pingpongball> it didnt gave bell
[20:22:14] <winny> There's your answer. On Debian I like to do 'apt-get build-dep pkgname' to ensure I have all the usual build dependencies installed. This might help suss out missing compile features 
[20:23:21] <Donatzsky> pingpongball: Try to switch back to Gnome, and then run the command there. If it works in Gnome, the "problem" is with bspwm
[20:23:39] <winny> You could also set the x11 bell to play some sound the same in any xclient. But dunno how to do that, google for 'x11 bell' might get you much closer 
[20:23:43] <pingpongball> yeah, i have just switched today in bspwm
[20:23:53] <pingpongball> it was owrking perfectly fine in gnome
[20:24:06] <rdrg109> berber: Thanks!

[22:04:38] <thblt> Re reimplementations of org mode, I wonder how far we could go driving the editor from an external process.  LSP supports syntax highlighting, Org could be reimplemented as an LSP server.

[22:04:44] <bpalmer> perrierjouet: org fundamentally is defined by what the org community does.

[22:06:27] <bpalmer> perrierjouet: so, the important part is not that somebody is copying org for vim; what matters is how many org "leaders" will start defining org in terms of vim (or keeping it at in their minds as they design things. Or, "design" things)
[22:06:29] <ajak> i switched to vim for a while, used some vim-org thing, eventually switched back to emacs
[22:06:41] <ajak> (albeit with evil)
[22:07:16] <perrierjouet> if emacs took steps 10 years a go ... or if it takes decision now to "overhaull" the core to enable some feautres mostly concurrency ... but I guess the emacs wizzards think it's worthless or the effort is too much to gain little from concurrency ... 
[22:07:17] *** Joins: manwhowouldbekin (~manwhowou@37-145-211-30.broadband.corbina.ru)
[22:07:55] <ajak> you're conflating something not being done with an active decision to not do the thing
[22:08:39] <bpalmer> elisp supports some forms of concurrency already, most notably but not exclusively in its handling of exterior processes and network connections.
[22:09:27] <bpalmer> Moreover, elisp is actively being encouraged to become lexically scoped, which is a *lot* easier to reason about in a concurrent environment.
[22:11:00] <bpalmer> without a change to predominant lexical scoping, I doubt serious concurrency in the core is a serious option, and that requires huge investment of time from the community that develops elisp.  So, it's maybe gradually happening.

[23:32:07] <roadie> ... and the one site in there without hosting has me as the owner and I can create a dir there ...
