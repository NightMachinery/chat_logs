[02:19:24] <anovick_> as for the [1,2] integral: this is the tricky part
[02:22:04] <anovick_> I expanded the integrand into a function where on the x=1 point to an arbitrary real number (I chose 1), and showed that this function is bounded. this function is continuous in every point in [1,2] except for x=1 and therefore it is integrable on [1,2]. since the integrand and this expanded function intersect except for one point, their integrals are equal.

[03:11:16] <Fangs> idk if its salvagable

[03:12:06] <Fangs> cherim: what do you mean?
[03:12:13] <Fangs> is my proof not relevant to problem 1.20?
[03:12:47] <cherim> In finite-dimensional case you got a descending sequence of dimensions so it has to stop. NO need to consider infinite-dimensional something here
[03:13:03] <cherim> For the second part, just present an explicit algebra and representation
[03:13:11] <cherim> Then prove stuff about them only
[03:13:14] <Fangs> cherim: I was showing the contrapositive (I misspoke saying it was the converse)

[03:13:38] <cherim> I think you covered the finite-dimensional case OK
[03:13:39] <Fangs> doesn't have irreducible sub representation -> infinite chain of vector spaces
[03:13:44] <Fangs> oh
[03:14:21] <Fangs> yeah ok I see what you mean if I added "let V be a finite dimensional vector space" and did this argument, I can say the chain has to stop
[03:14:37] <Fangs> cherim: C[x] is an example for 2
[03:14:54] <cherim> Ok, then 1.20 is done
[03:14:56] <Fangs> for second part that is. afaik C[x] doesn't have a 'minimal ideal' but idk how to prove this
[03:15:29] <Fangs> anyway this happened on the "official discord server"
[03:15:29] <Fangs> 16:38 <Fangs> I said really dumb shit like A = C[z,z^{-1}] is irreducible an A-module over itself
[03:15:29] <Fangs> 16:39 <Fangs> then I corrected myself, then eventually I came to the conclusion that C[z] is a counter example
[03:15:29] <Fangs> 16:39 <Fangs> then the lecturer said "Infinite dimensional representations is a very tricky subject"
[03:15:29] <Fangs> 16:39 <Fangs> RIP me
[03:15:36] <Fangs> err oops meant that as a paste
[03:16:45] <Fangs> C[x] is a PID so I think I can make the argument by looking at the principal generator and talk about the degree of these generators
[03:17:48] <cherim> "Suppose V is an irreducible..." is easier than describing all subrepresentations

[03:19:23] <Fangs> cherim: what's the context you're talking about
[03:19:33] <cherim> And you want a proper nontrivial subrepresentation for a contradiction, no?

[03:20:57] <Fangs> I think I'm mostly done, just not sure how I'd go about showing C[x] doesn't have a minimap ideal
[03:21:12] <Fangs> *minimal
[03:21:22] <cherim> Why do you even define ideals
[03:21:55] <Fangs> cherim: I took C[x] as a representation over C[x], in this case ideals are subrepresentations (sub-C[x]-modules)
[03:21:58] <cherim> You want to show that when A=C[x] and the representation is by acting on itself, there are no irreducible subrepresentations

[03:22:17] <cherim> Suppose V is an irreducible subrepresentation
[03:22:36] <cherim> Then (...) is its proper subrepresentation in contradiction to irreducibility
[03:25:21] <anovick_> Trying to prove that last question I posted with a slight twist (Calculus: integration, limits): with f(x) being positive and decreasing in (0,1], and there is alpha => 0 such that integral of x^alpha * f(x) dx converges. I'm trying to show that lim x^(alpha + 1) * f(x) as x-> 0+ = 0
[03:26:07] <anovick_> there is a hint to use Cauchy test for generalized integrals here but I don't see how it can be applied
[03:26:16] <Fangs> cherim: think your argument works, xV c V is always a proper subrepresentation
[03:26:33] <cherim> Not really a wonder
[03:27:06] <Fangs> "08:46 <Fangs> C[x] is a PID so I think I can make the argument by looking at the principal generator and talk about the degree of these generators" this is wrong

[12:25:23] <gas51627> Hi guys
[12:26:11] <gas51627> if there is a task: Analize the logical forms of the following statement. The universe of discourse is R. What are the free variables? and the statement is: If there is a number x such that x2+5x=w has at and there is a number y such that 4−y2=w, then w is strictly beteween -10 and 10

[12:37:13] <gas51627> well, it's just a problem from the textbook on logic
[12:37:31] <gas51627> what I mean is that should I actually prove the statement
[12:37:49] <gas51627> i.e. solve somehow those equations and then show that w should be in those bounds
[12:38:07] <gas51627> i.e. to say in the end - the statement is right / wrong

[15:22:35] <gas51627> hi, going back to the problem: Analyze the logical form of the following statement. The universe of discourse is R. What are the free variables? If there is a number x such that x^2+5x=w and there is a number y such that 4−y^2=w, then w is strictly between -10 and 10.
[15:22:35] <gas51627> Solution: (∃x[x2+5x=w]∧∃y[4−y2=w])→(w>−10∧w<10). Free variable is w.
[15:22:35] <gas51627> can I then say: (∃x[x2+5x=w]∧∃y[4−y2=w])  is equivalent to ∃xy[x2+5x=4−y2], which would eliminate w altogether?

[15:25:08] <Fangs> gas51627: how do you bound w?
[15:25:33] <Fangs> I like to think of it as "for all w, if "(∃x[x2+5x=w]∧∃y[4−y2=w])" then w satisfies "(w>−10∧w<10)"
[15:26:17] <gas51627> yes but if x^2+5x = w and 4-y^2 = w, then it's the same w, right?
[15:26:44] <Fangs> it is the same w, they're bound by the same quantifier
[15:26:54] <Fangs> (I added the for all quantifier)
[15:27:17] <gas51627> so in the end w is not needed, because you can simply write x^2+5x=4-y^2

[15:34:06] <gulzar> Hi. I asked this yesterday but got disconnected. Apologies..   I have three set of points. A, B, C.       A and B are making two planes, parallel to each other.     C is scattered around.   I need to find out the points from C within A,B. What formula, maths can work?
[15:34:24] <PlanckWalk> gas51627: w is still needed.
[15:34:59] <PlanckWalk> You can't eliminate it so easily from "w < 10 and w > -10"
[15:35:20] <gas51627> PlanckWalk: I get it but i still somehow still doesn't understand why, how it is needed
[15:35:59] <gas51627> I mean, if you have 2 equations x^2 + 5x = w and 4 - y2 = w, you could write x^2 + 5x = 4 - y ^2 without any trouble, right?
[15:36:16] <PlanckWalk> You can derive each from the other, yes

[15:36:58] <PlanckWalk> They're not equivalent, though.
[15:37:13] <PlanckWalk> Since there's a free variable in one that isn't in the other
[15:37:52] <PlanckWalk> Technically from "x^2 + 5x = 4 - y^2" you can derive "there exists w such that x^2 + 5x = w and 4 - y^2 = w"
[15:38:14] <PlanckWalk> Which isn't the same thing as just "x^2 + 5x = w and 4 - y^2 = w"

[15:40:50] <gas51627> is there such a notion as a "useless" variable?
[15:40:56] <gas51627> if yes, then I would put "w" there

[15:49:50] <gas51627> is there some special name for this kind of a and b?
[15:50:58] <W> I guess that a is an invertible function of b?
[15:51:36] <W> it's generally the case, I would say, so it doesn't really have its own name in equations
[15:52:53] <Fangs> gas51627: then a and b are logically equivalent
[15:53:07] <gas51627> Fangs, a-ha
[15:53:11] <W> gulzar, yes, if either A or B has at least three points, and neither is empty, you can find the normal
[15:53:20] <Fangs> gas51627: Im assuming a and b are proposition or some logical sentence
[15:53:38] <Fangs> (not variables in an equation like x,y,w in what you wrote previously)
[15:53:51] <gulzar> W: there are like 100s of points in each A and B. They are almost of same size.
[15:53:54] <gas51627> thus x^2+5x=w and 4-y^2 =w is equivalent to x^2+5x=4-y^2 (since you can derive second from the first and first from the second)
[15:54:00] <W> and find a linear functional that transforms any point to a position on the implicit line defined by this normal
[15:54:20] <Fangs> gas51627: no
[15:54:25] <gas51627> but you just said
[15:54:35] <Fangs> gas51627: thats two sets of equations, not logical sentences
[15:54:57] <W> all points in A will have the same value, and all points in B will have a different same value, and you can then compare the value of each point in C to these values to see if it is between them

[15:57:02] <gas51627> not really

[16:00:12] <PlanckWalk> At any rate, they're not logically derivable from each other.
[16:00:21] <PlanckWalk> You have to use some algebraic derivations
[16:00:22] <W> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Matrix_notation gets you the vector for the normal, and I'll have to refresh my memory on how to turn that to a linear functional, but I think it's just that vector
[16:01:40] <PlanckWalk> Once you get a normal vector, then n.p = constant for all points p in the plane
[16:01:42] <W> (i.e. in your case, the two vectors would be something like (a_1 - a_0) and (a_2 - a_0) for three arbitrary points a_0 to a_2 from A)
[16:03:11] <PlanckWalk> You can then write it as  n.p - C = 0.  All the points on the side that n points will have positive values for n.p - C,  and points on the other give negative.

For x^2+5x=w to have an R solution for x, w must be >= -(2.5)^2 , for 4 - y^2=w to have an R solution for y, w must be <= 4.

[16:19:50] <PlanckWalk> Usually statements are allowed to have free variables.

[16:20:40] <W> gulzar, there's some other slight concerns as well, such as picking three such points from A or B that are not colinear
[16:21:34] <PlanckWalk> gas51627: Could be either.
[16:21:53] <PlanckWalk> As in, both forms are used in mathematics.  It's usually dependent upon context.
[16:22:26] <Fangs> gas51627: what's the definition of a free variable?
[16:22:29] <PlanckWalk> I'd usually interpret it to have no free variables.
[16:22:43] <PlanckWalk> As in, implicitly quantify it with ∀w
[16:22:50] <Fangs> if there's a free variable you can quantify it with either the existence, or the for all
[16:22:57] <Fangs> (technically right?)
[16:23:15] <Fangs> and what PlanckWalk said, usually if there's a free variable, its taken to be quantified with "for all"
[16:23:40] <PlanckWalk> But in some other context, you might have previously defined the variable w.
[16:24:26] <PlanckWalk> Then the statement would be about that already-defined w.

Sorry, I'm just learning linear algebra and thought I had the answer. The cross product is definitely the way though. And you can just do it by components instead of fiddling with matrices once you have it, e.g. x/c_x+y/c_y+z/c_z for any (x,y,z) point and c being the cross product. I don't know the exact linear algebra terms for arriving at this in a more
[16:47:44] <W> terse way.
[16:49:37] <W> (the cross product can also be found by components, e.g. following the wikipedia article linked earlier - and maybe if you do it all by components, the resulting formula might be simplified)
[16:51:02] <W> something something parallel affine subspace

[16:54:02] <buster> W, in R^3 things are deceptively easy. In an abstract three-dimensional real vector space there is no cross product until you choose an inner product and an orientation. And the inner product also gives you a special way to convert a vector into a linear functional.

[17:00:00] <W> I mean you /shouldn't/ need the cross product, given the presumptions; you have parallel subspaces that might as well be hyperplanes, any of which is itself (trivially transformable to) a linear functional right? It's just convenient for the given data. Looking in my textbook for the right terms now

[17:04:52] <PlanckWalk> In theory you don't even need a normal vector.  It's just common to do it that way.
[17:05:04] <buster> { linear functionals } are in correspondence with { planes through the origin }. you also need a 'distance' ... except that (kf)(v) = d iff f(v) = d/k (for k a scalar, v a vector, f a covector). it works out better in projective space.

[17:07:12] <W> well in this case, we're lucky in that we don't actually need the distance in absolute terms, only comparable ("between A and B"), and we can probably presume that neither A nor B is actually a subspace (I used the wrong term earlier, I meant affine subset apparently)
[17:08:04] <W> so e.g. just arbitrarily picking the distance to A as the unit would work
[17:08:20] <billionaire> Hi! I suck at math and got this test the other day: https://clbin.com/4knft -- I was told "either you get it or you don't". Is it at all based on mathematics? How would you think in order to solve it? (I hope I remembered it right)
[17:09:13] <billionaire> It's about how to most efficiently plan a work day for two employees
[17:09:29] <PlanckWalk> Except missing almost all the relevant information.
[17:10:24] <PlanckWalk> Like, how much time for each task is needed per table
[17:10:37] <buster> W, my book calls the affine span of k+1 vectors an 'affine k-flat'
[17:11:01] <W> billionaire, there's a lot of things to assume, e.g. are tasks equal length, does the number of people actually working on it matter (two working halves the time?) etc, but there's a basic set of presumptions we can make where yes, I would say the answer is apparent in how to organize things most efficiently, though I'd say it's more problem solving or logic, than mathematics

[17:17:31] <billionaire> Interesting

[17:18:13] <billionaire> Cool
[17:18:24] <billionaire> Makes a lot more sense now...
[17:19:17] <W> billionaire, people differ in skill at various tasks, this is not a matter of inferior or superior, and in any case is often a matter of training or study, not something inherent to you. Mathematics is not necessary for this, sure, but some experience organizing tasks or some equivalent problem probably helps.
[17:19:48] <billionaire> Having a similar test on Thursday, since I told them I felt I could do better in front of a computer (for drafting) and perhaps using a programming language (I love Ruby for instance)
[17:20:47] <PlanckWalk> One combinatorial math problem would be to count the optimal solutions.
[17:20:48] <billionaire> W: When you put it like that, it was their mistake to throw me into this without adequate training
[17:22:00] <billionaire> But they said very few people actually managed to solve this
[17:22:37] <Fangs> regardless theres an entire mathematical discipline dedicated to scheduling
[17:22:53] <billionaire> PlanckWalk: I reckon that sorta stuff would be most suited for more advanced mathematicians?
[17:23:01] <billionaire> Fangs: hehe
[17:23:21] <PlanckWalk> Ones more interested in the math than in the actual task, for sure ;-)
[17:23:23] <Fangs> (its fairly lucrative too I heard)
[17:24:06] <PlanckWalk> But yeah, there are lots of unstated assumptions in there.
[17:24:30] <PlanckWalk> Or questions you'd need to ask to get enough information to make a decent shot at solving it
[17:25:20] <billionaire> IIRC that was all there was
[17:25:35] <PlanckWalk> E.g. is there any penalty in productivity from switching tasks?  Do the workers learn how to do the job better if they do the same task a lot?  Do they get bored?
[17:25:52] <billionaire> Is it ok if I return on Thursday with a similar problem (this time hopefully with some more assumptions)
[17:25:53] <billionaire> haha
[17:26:31] <PlanckWalk> Do workers have to do the same task for each hour?  Does each table need all four tasks done in sequence, or can some be reordered?  Does each table need exactly one hour for each task?
[17:26:38] <W> reading between the lines to correctly guess what unstated assumptions the writer has made is a skill in itself
[17:26:50] <PlanckWalk> Does the paint need time to dry before packaging?
[17:27:02] <billionaire> PlanckWalk: Ah actually no, it did not need to dry
[17:27:06] <billionaire> I remember now
[17:27:36] <PlanckWalk> These are just a few of the hundreds or so questions that need answers to actually plan this sort of thing in real life.
[17:27:47] <billionaire> That much huh
[17:28:14] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, you shoudl see the studies one company I worked for had on their production lines.
[17:28:19] <gas51627> how would I approach solving inequality x^3 - 3x < 3 ?
[17:28:20] <Fangs> is this a real problem?

[23:38:22] <Guest51> i'm a bit confused on how to solve these equations if i can't get a value for `n`
[23:38:45] <riv> Guest51, 2
[23:39:17] <Guest51> 2 = 8 * log_2(2)?
[23:39:36] <Koen_> according to https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=n+%3D+8+log2%28n%29 there are two solutions, one approximately 1.1, one approximately 43.6
[23:40:54] <Guest51> yeah i was looking at wolfram earlier to see how to solve it, but it didn't give any steps i could follow
[23:41:31] <Guest51> so when trying to figure out when two different algorithms have the same solve time, what exactly should i be doing? (that's not using WA)
[23:42:05] <qergle> to solve analytically? you need to adopt a function invented just for this purpose: lambert's q
[23:42:11] <qergle> er, lambert's w
[23:42:40] <qergle> if not, let a solver give you numerical approximations.
[23:42:53] <Guest51> is this something all computer scientists should know?
[23:43:08] <Guest51> specifically do they teach this in undergrad compsci courses
[23:43:16] <Koen_> Guest51: other equations can be simpler to solve; but x = log(x) doesn't have any nice solution
[23:43:36] <HisShadow> Guest51: there's no exact solution when n is integer, but you can use binary search to find n1 for which n1 < 8 * log_2(n1) and n2 for which n2 > 8 log_2(n2)
[23:44:03] <qergle> n=log_2(n^8) -> 2^n = n^8, this can help you get a numerical solution
[23:44:28] <HisShadow> Koen_: x = log(x) doesn't have any since x > log(x)
[23:44:30] <mh_le> heya
[23:44:33] <Koen_> lol
[23:44:45] <Koen_> I didn't have coffee today :(

[23:46:38] <Guest51> ok thanks guys, guess i'll look up how to use Lambert's q then

[23:46:52] <riv> do the bisection method
[23:46:54] <qergle> lambert w, the "q" was because my fingers are fat and the phone kb is small
[23:46:55] <riv> you dont need lambert

[23:47:03] <qergle> qwerty has q next to w
[23:47:17] <riv> if a continous function is below zero at x1 and above zero at x2 you know there's a root somewhere between x1 and x2

[23:52:14] <average> riv: this is 2021, get with the program
[23:53:44] <Vornicus> q is a more fun letter than w, so using lambert's q sounds like more fun
[23:54:00] * W strongly disagrees
