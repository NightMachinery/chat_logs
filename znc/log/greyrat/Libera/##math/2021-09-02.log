[00:19:59] <CuriousErnestBro> is it possible to get the joint distribution from these conditional probabilites? p(a1|a2)=3/4, p(a2|a1)=1, p(a2|b1)=3/4, p(a1|b2)=0
[00:20:22] <CuriousErnestBro> I used Bayes' theorem to get p(a1)=3/7 and p(a2)=4/7
[00:20:30] <CuriousErnestBro> I'm not sure how to proceed.
[00:21:09] <nejimban> you can now get p(a1 ∩ a2)
[00:22:30] *** Quits: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[00:22:59] <CuriousErnestBro> well that's 0, that is assumed
[00:23:54] <CuriousErnestBro> a1 and a2 are the only 2 outcomes for A. same for B
[00:24:10] <CuriousErnestBro> by the "joint distribution" I mean a 2x2 matrix
[00:24:11] <nejimban> oh ok
[00:24:13] * CuriousErnestBro is confused...
[00:24:24] <nejimban> p(ai ∩ bj) then?
[00:24:51] <qergle> you need 4 probabilities
[00:24:55] <CuriousErnestBro> yes, I need all 4
[00:25:03] <CuriousErnestBro> for i=1,2, j=1,2
[00:25:41] <qergle> what can help with p(a1 ∩ b1) then?
[00:25:49] <qergle> which conditionals include that
[00:26:19] <nejimban> that's p(a1) - p(a1 ∩ b2) I guess
[00:26:23] <CuriousErnestBro> p(a2 | b1) = 3/4 and p(a1 | b2) = 0
[00:26:32] <nejimban> draw some venn diagrams
[00:26:42] <qergle> also if you said a1,a2 are mutualy exclusive how can p(a1|a2)=3/4?
[00:26:49] <qergle> did you mis-write the conditionals/
[00:26:50] <qergle> ?
[00:27:48] <nejimban> hmm I think he only wanted to say Ω = a1 ∪ a2 = b1 ∪ b2
[00:27:53] <nejimban> not necessarily in a disjoint way
[00:28:06] <CuriousErnestBro> qergle yeah I'm also very confused by that...
[00:28:35] <int-e> nejimban: well that'll be impossible
[00:28:41] <qergle> ok, well p(a1|a2)=3/4 and p(a1 ∩ a2)=0 can't both be true
[00:28:55] <CuriousErnestBro> I see that
[00:28:59] <CuriousErnestBro> This is the question: http://0x0.st/-v2Z.png
[00:29:02] <nejimban> oh yes :d
[00:29:06] <CuriousErnestBro> a is s and b is t
[00:30:04] <nejimban> so… Ω = a1 ∪ b1 = a2 ∪ b2 ?
[00:30:06] <qergle> so p(s1 ∩ s2)=p(s1)
[00:30:52] <int-e> so... player 1 gets to chose between s1 and t1...
[00:30:59] <qergle> and p(s1 ∩ s2)=p(s1)=(3/4)*p(s2)
[00:31:01] <buster> right, it's a1 ∩ b1 = a2 ∩ b2 = 0.
[00:31:27] <qergle> ok, i can't track s,t,a,b :) i will go out and water my petunias.

[00:32:12] <buster> (in the original notation.) rather than a1 ∩ a2 = b1 ∩ b2 = 0.
[00:32:14] <CuriousErnestBro> yes I follow
[00:32:51] <int-e> I /think/ s1 and t1 are supposed to be disjoint and comprise Omega; same for s2 and t2.
[00:33:07] <int-e> And then all those constraints look a bit more plausible.
[00:33:55] <CuriousErnestBro> OHHH
[00:34:00] <CuriousErnestBro> yes you're right

[00:34:29] <CuriousErnestBro> I'm stupid
[00:34:55] <CuriousErnestBro> p(s1) + p(t1) = 1
[00:34:56] <CuriousErnestBro> Now I think I can do it.
[00:35:14] <CuriousErnestBro> thanks int-e I should have read the question more carefully

[08:59:04] <Guest7> I guess?
[08:59:05] <loopspace> The division algorithm operates on Euclidean domains
[09:00:13] <Guest7> like if I want to divide 4x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 3 by 2x+1. First step is to say "what do i need to multiply 2x by to get 4x^3" which is 2x^2. But...why do we do this?
[09:01:16] <blueberrycrop> loopspace ok but what is time itself?
[09:03:17] <Galois> you're trying to obtain a remainder of the smallest possible degree. So it makes sense to eliminate the highest degree term first.
[09:04:22] <loopspace> "Given an element a and a non-zero element b in a Euclidean domain R equipped with a Euclidean function d (also known as a Euclidean valuationor degree function), there exist q and r in R such that a = bq + r and either r = 0 or d(r) < d(b)."
[09:04:56] <blueberrycrop> sheesh, that's too advanced for me.
[09:05:03] <Galois> I don't think that's particularly useful in this context, since the purpose of polynomial division is to show that polynomials form a Euclidean domain in the first place
[09:05:17] *** Joins: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide)
[09:05:18] <blueberrycrop> what do they even call that type of math?
[09:05:26] <Galois> any statement of the form "Given a Euclidean domain ..." is not immediately useful if you don't _already_ know that you have a Euclidean domain

[09:05:34] <loopspace> Guest7: maybe this sort of page might help you http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~john/MT4517/Lectures/L6.html
[09:05:56] <blueberrycrop> ok yeah but how can I get there?
[09:06:05] *** Joins: homura (root@2605:6400:c847:1486::6841)
[09:06:12] <blueberrycrop> how can I reach your level of mathematical thinking?
[09:06:16] <Galois> also, this proof on this web page is laughably useless: " Just the same as for Z -- except that the divisions are more tedious."
[09:06:41] <Galois> like, come on. That's not a proof even by the most lenient standards of rigor.
[09:06:52] <Guest7> Galois what is meant by eliminate ?
[09:07:14] <Galois> ok, so you're dividing f(x) by g(x)
[09:07:23] <Galois> you want a quotient q(x) and a remainder r(x), such that:
[09:07:31] <Galois> 1. f(x) = g(x) * q(x) + r(x)
[09:07:32] <Galois> and
[09:07:38] <Galois> 2. degree of r(x) is as small as possible
[09:08:02] <Galois> rewrite equation 1 as follows: r(x) = f(x) - g(x) * q(x)
[09:08:27] <Galois> "eliminate" means: choose q(x) such that deg(f(x) - g(x) * q(x)) < deg(f(x))
[09:08:59] <Galois> that's the first step. I mean, obviously, you can trivially obtain r(x) = f(x) just by setting q(x) = 0
[09:09:14] <Guest7> ohhh
[09:09:28] <Galois> so, to do any better than the trivial choice, you must arrange it so that the degree of r(x) is smaller than the degree of f(x)
[09:11:38] <Galois> in your example, f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 3 and g(x) = 2x + 1. By choosing q(x) = 2x^2, you obtain r(x) = f(x) - g(x) * q(x) = x + 3, which has degree smaller than the degree of f(x)
[09:12:21] <Galois> in this case, you can do better than that, but that's the first step. To do better, the idea is simple: just take r(x) as your "new" f(x)
[09:12:35] *** Joins: kakuhen (~kakuhen@user/kakuhen)
[09:14:00] <Galois> You keep going until deg(r(x)) < deg(g(x)). Once you reach that point, you stop, because you can't reduce deg(r(x)) any further.
[09:14:34] <loopspace> The "purpose of polynomial division" is not "to show that polynomials form a Euclidean domain in the first place"
[09:14:40] <Galois> it may be the case that deg(f(x)) < deg(g(x)) from the start. In this case, you can't do any better than the trivial solution q(x) = 0 and r(x) = f(x)

[11:08:18] <fweht> i just look at it bc i want to understand cohomology and how its dual to homology and nlab says cohomology is natively defined for infinity grupoids and from there gets inherited by topological spaces, manifolds, etc. so now i want to understand infinity grupoids haha
[11:08:29] <CuriousErnestBro> thanks cherim
[11:08:31] <Fangs> what's your background?
[11:08:38] <CuriousErnestBro> although I don't know how to do it by hand
[11:08:45] <CuriousErnestBro> I guess I'll find out today during class
[11:09:04] <Fangs> fweht: going from "what is cohomology" and arriving at "infinite loop spaces" is a bit much
[11:09:06] <fweht> not much background, i passed a course in algebraic topology but that was pretty hard
[11:09:19] <Fangs> what do you care about?
[11:09:54] <fweht> i dont know, i just want the intuition
[11:10:18] <Fangs> fweht: do you know stoke's theorem from calculus?
[11:10:31] <fweht> yes
[11:10:36] <Fangs> (not everyone would've done vector calculus, but that seems like a pretty popular subject)
[11:10:50] <Fangs> fweht: so thats a pairing between homology and cohomology
[11:11:28] <Fangs> if you have a differential n form w (omega) and a singular chain X, then \int_{boundary X) w = \int_{X} dw
[11:11:50] <fweht> ok
[11:12:00] <Fangs> in this setting the pairing is fairly explicit
[11:12:08] <Fangs> fweht: you can also look up poincare dual
[11:12:14] <fweht> cool, will do!
[11:12:22] <Fangs> if you've seen graphs you've probably seen a poincary dual to a planar graph
[11:12:27] <Fangs> *poincare
[11:12:34] <fweht> yup
[11:13:00] <Fangs> that's also another way to 'pair' homology and cohomology
[11:14:19] <fweht> i understand singular homology and de rham homology a bit, but i still need to get the definition of cohomology, i want to understand how the def of cohomology is just homology with reversed arrows
[11:14:50] <fweht> some definitions include a group, but i cant remember having a group in singular homology?  i mean group as input parameter, not the group generated by the singular chains
[11:14:52] <Fangs> fweht: so let's pretend we have a n = 2 dimensional space. given a vertex v, define a function on the faces of your 'space' f_v(face) = 1 if v \in face and 0 if v \not in face, this turns a vertex v into a 'function' on the faces (or n-dimensional subobject things)
[11:15:15] <Fangs> fweht: the chain complex is a bunch of groups
[11:15:42] <Fangs> oh as an input parameter
[11:16:15] <fweht> sorry for bringing so many questions
[11:17:18] <Fangs> fweht: you should think of cohomology as a functions on the singular chain complex, if you have Sing_n(X) the singular n-chains on your space X.. say with Z-coefficien,t then the dual 'cochain' complex is given by Hom(Sing_n(X),Z)
[11:18:22] <fweht> ok!
[11:18:24] <Fangs> it reverses the arrow for this reason. If X --f--> Y is some arrow, then Hom(X,Z) <--f*-- Hom(Y,Z) is 'reversed'.. given a map g: Y->Z there's an obvious way to make this into a function on X... namely X --f--Y--g-->Z
[11:18:45] <Fangs> fweht: so all the boundary maps becomes a 'coboundary' map going the other way
[11:19:25] <Fangs> this is the convenient definition for cohomology, but if you want to work with things explicitly you usually use that poincare duality as an intuition.. but yeah.. this way its literally 'functions on singular chains'
[11:20:20] <fweht> ok that makes sense, but i still dont fully get, is cohomology just another construction that reverses some arrows w.r.t. to homology or is it exactly the same definition just with reversed arrows?  because Sing_n(X) and Hom(Sing_n(X),Z) dont look completely dual?  or do i miss something here?
[11:21:18] <Fangs> fweht: let X Y be spaces, and f: X -> Y be some continuous map, what kind of map does this induce on Sing_n(X) vs Hom(Sing_n(X),Z)?
[11:22:01] <fweht> i guess Sing_n(X) -> Sing_n(Y) and Hom(Sing_n(Y),Z) -> Hom(Sing_n(X),Z)
[11:22:19] <Fangs> yeah, so homology is a covariant invariant of the space, while cohomology is contravariant
[11:22:27] <Fangs> so thats one difference
[11:22:30] <fweht> yeah makes sense
[11:22:44] <Fangs> fweht: another is cohomology collectively forms a cohomology group
[11:22:47] <Fangs> errr
[11:22:50] <Fangs> cohomology ring*
[11:23:01] <fweht> ok, so its *not* the *same* definition up to duality?
[11:23:07] <fweht> this helps me a lot already
[11:23:15] <fweht> yeah i read about the ring
[11:23:30] <Fangs> it kinda is, at least at the cochain level
[11:23:48] <Fangs> Hom(_,Z) is a contravariant functor, it reverses the arrows
[11:24:14] <Fangs> (there's a reason why we don't have products in homology vs in cohomology.. but I'll admit I'm pretty weak on this and idk why)
[11:24:31] <fweht> ah ok, so you have two ways to form a chain complexes and from there on you proceed in dual ways?

[11:38:21] <Fangs> but H^1(BG;G) has a special element that corresponds to the identity map [BG;BG]... and that c in H^1(X;G) ends up being the image of this 'identity class'  under c*

[11:39:26] <Fangs> yeah idk if I should say much more, but that's the topological side of group cohomology, at least why they seem to show up a lot and or why they're useful
[11:39:27] <fweht> seems elegant
[11:39:55] <Fangs> fweht: if G is a finite group, you can compute and define cohomology groups of this "BG" purely algebraicaly
[11:40:08] <Fangs> for cyclic groups its so easy that you can set it as a HW assignment
[11:40:45] <fweht> i should do another course
[11:41:03] <Fangs> so H*(G;Z) is the 'group cohomology' of G with coefficient in Z say.. but you could've forego that and work purely in terms of H*(BG;Z)
[11:42:15] <Fangs> the only problem is BG is not really a particular space.. its a "homotopy type".. if we restrict our spaces to mean "equivalent to a CW complex" in some sense, any space with pi_0 = *, pi_1 = G, and pi_n = 0 would do..

[11:59:11] <fweht> no worry ill take it slow
[11:59:16] <fweht> first learn about de rham theorem
[11:59:20] <Fangs> I still don't know what your background is, or what you worry about
[12:00:06] <fweht> nothing in particular, my background is bsc in math and now i work in webdesign and now and then i try to understand some topic that seems interesting, and then i get from one definition to another
[12:00:17] <Fangs> fweht: let me tell you about one more thing regarding homology vs cohomology.. there are these things called cohomology operations... have you heard of that really famous result that the only real division algebras are R, C, and H?
[12:00:19] <fweht> just as with gauge theory, i came to cohomology, then to de rham, etc.
[12:00:41] <Fangs> yeah I think I should tell you something more topological too to balance it out
[12:00:41] <fweht> yes, i think so
[12:01:15] <fweht> at least i heard that you lose axioms by going from R to R^2 to R^4 to R^8 etc.
[12:01:58] <Fangs> thats the cayley constructions I think, and R^8 isnt even an associative algebra
[12:02:18] <Fangs> fweht: so if X ~= some R^n, and X x X -> X is some multiplication, if you take the unit sphere in X, you end up with this topological question about properties of maps from S^n x S^n -> S^n
[12:02:56] <fweht> yes
[12:02:56] <Fangs> I forgot how the story goes, but its enough to work over Z/2Z, and you can show that any real division algebra can only happen in some power of 2 dimension
[12:03:20] <Fangs> fweht: theres this book which is fairly 'fun' to read apparently, Mosher and Tangora
[12:03:44] <Fangs> after setting up the machinary, you can prove that result just by doing some fairly 'trivial' calculation
[12:03:55] <fweht> nice
[12:04:07] <Fangs> (I only read the section on Postnikov towers.. that book is a bit of a treasure trove)
[12:04:44] <Fangs> the full result is fiarly difficult with ordinary cohomology theory, but its 'trivial' if you use K-theory, which is a generalized cohomology theory
[12:04:55] <fweht> i read that the proof of de rhams theorem is in John M. Lee, Introduction to smooth manifolds
[12:05:17] <fweht> k-theory sounds so alien
[12:05:45] <Fangs> (you have a cohomology operation for K theory too, and the 'trivial' calculation gives you the full result instead in this case, instead of just 2^k-dimension)
[12:07:00] <Fangs> fweht: its not that bad.. for the 0-th group, you can take complex/real vector bundles over X.. turns out this forms a ring, sort of.. you have addition by taking direct sum of vector bundles (think of direct sums of vector spaces) and ditto for tensor products
[12:07:42] <Fangs> the trivial bundle X x R^n is the 'unit', it acts like 0 (I think?)
[12:08:57] <Fangs> fweht: then you encode "A - B" as pairs (A,B) of vector bundles and say (A,B) ~ (C,D) if A(+)D ~= B(+)D (you might need a factor of R^n somewhere)
[12:09:10] <Fangs> if A(+)D ~= B(+)C sorry

[12:25:17] <fweht> yeah, im a bit of both, i usually start with just wanting to get the big picture and then end up trying to understand the details of a minor technical proof
[12:26:28] <fweht> for example the other day why a function on the boundary of a simplex is smooth if the restriction to its faces are smooth...  not really difficult but the proof missed a bit details which confused me

[13:01:34] <[-_-]> yeah
[13:01:46] <Fangs> but to say "its not a vector" is a bit confusion, because the "f" is what's meant to be a vector
[13:02:07] <int-e> [-_-]: it's more interesting to unpack the notion of linear dependence, really. f, g and h are linearly dependent if there are real numbers a,b,c, not all zero, such that af + bg + ch = 0, meaning that af(x) + bg(x) + ch(x) = 0 for all x in R.
[13:02:10] <Fangs> so if you write an arrow on top of the vector f, thats confusing

[13:34:30] <[-_-]> n
[13:34:32] <Franciman> great
[13:34:35] <Franciman> now last question
[13:34:37] <Franciman> what is the degree of
[13:34:42] <Franciman> a_0 + .... + a_n * x^n
[13:34:45] <Franciman> it could be n
[13:34:49] <Franciman> but it could be lower, if a_n = 0
[13:34:52] <Franciman> right?
[13:34:57] <[-_-]> yes
[13:35:04] <Franciman> so we reason as follows:
[13:35:08] <Franciman> if the polynomial has degree n
[13:35:11] <Franciman> i.e. a_n != 0
[13:35:33] <Franciman> it should have at most n solutions, but this is impossible, because there are infinitely many
[13:35:35] <Franciman> so a_n = 0
[13:35:41] <Franciman> and we are left with
[13:35:48] <Franciman> a_0 + .... + a_{n-1} * x^{n-1}
[13:35:57] <[-_-]> hmmm
[13:35:58] <Franciman> you repeat this argument, and find that a_{n-1} is zero too!
[13:36:26] <Franciman> you end up with a_0
[13:36:31] <Franciman> if a_0 != 0
[13:36:35] <Franciman> the polynomial has no solutions
[13:36:37] <Franciman> so it must be 0
[13:36:47] <Franciman> and indeed, 0 has infinite solutions, it is the only such polynomial
[13:36:57] <[-_-]> okay
[13:37:00] <[-_-]> :)
[13:37:03] <Vornicus> hrm, this is interesting.  Wokring through a discrete differential geometry course and it's talking about different ways to come up with a value for the normal at a vertex in a triangle mesh.  One is by summing the area gradients of the adjacent triangles (which are each in the plane of their respective triangles) and another is the volume gradients of same (which are each normal to the plane of their
[13:37:03] <Vornicus> respective triangles).  I am told - by being asked to prove it in an exercise - that these two are in fact pointing in the same direction...
[13:37:12] <Franciman> can you repeat the argument by yourself, [-_-] ?
[13:37:16] <Franciman> does it make sense to you?
[13:37:21] <Franciman> I suggest trying on an actual polynomial
[13:37:24] <Franciman> for example
[13:37:47] <Franciman> a + b*x + c*x^2 + d*x^3
[13:37:52] <Franciman> if it has infinite solutions
[13:37:52] *** Quits: trace987 (~trace@ip5f5a6a70.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[13:38:05] <Franciman> then d = 0, otherwise it would have degree 3 and at most 3 solutions
[13:38:07] <Franciman> so it must be
[13:38:10] <Franciman> a + b*x + c*x^2
[13:38:18] <Franciman> again, if c != 0, it should have at most 2 solutions
[13:38:20] <Franciman> so c = 0
[13:38:33] <Franciman> a + b*x has the same situation, so b = 0. Finally you are left with: a
[13:38:40] <[-_-]> I think you meant a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 =0
[13:38:43] <Franciman> yes
[13:38:53] <Franciman> but the idea is the same
[13:39:06] <[-_-]> that is why we must have degree 0
[13:39:25] <Franciman> that is why the polynomial must have no power of x
[13:39:30] <Franciman> so it must be a constant
[13:39:48] <[-_-]> hmmmm....so no matter the root it is zero
[13:40:03] <Franciman> yeah, if you have infinite solutions, yep
[13:40:23] <Franciman> [-_-]: there is a simpler way to do this argument, but it requires a definition of the degree
[13:40:37] <Franciman> basically, given a nonzero polynomial, you can associate a degree to it
[13:40:42] <Franciman> so take all polynomials
[13:40:56] <Franciman> they either have a degree or they are the 0 polynomial
[13:41:00] <Franciman> right?
[13:41:04] <[-_-]> hmmm..
[13:41:33] <Franciman> you can see this as follows
[13:41:36] <Franciman> take a polynomial
[13:41:38] <Franciman> is it zero?
[13:41:42] <Franciman> if so, ok
[13:41:50] <Franciman> if it is not zero, you can assign a degree to it
[13:41:52] <Franciman> as we saw earlier

[13:42:12] <[-_-]> ha....
[13:42:26] <Franciman> so if they hand a polynomial to you in a closed box, you know nothing about it
[13:42:29] <Franciman> but you know two things
[13:42:33] <Franciman> it either is 0
[13:42:35] <Franciman> or it has a degree
[13:43:04] <[-_-]> right
[13:43:07] <Franciman> if the FedEx guy tells you, hey this polynomial has infinite solutions
[13:43:10] <Franciman> you reason a bit
[13:43:13] <Franciman> uhm....
[13:43:19] <Franciman> this polynomial is either zero or it has a degree
[13:43:20] <Franciman> but
[13:43:25] <Franciman> if it has a degree
[13:43:30] <Franciman> n
[13:43:35] <Franciman> it could have at most n roots
[13:43:41] <Franciman> how can it have infinite solutions?
[13:43:47] <Franciman> then it must be 0
[13:43:49] <Franciman> ...
[13:43:54] <[-_-]> right
[13:44:09] <[-_-]> Now my question is how do I know it hase infinite solutions
[13:44:33] <Franciman> let me read the preceding
[13:44:53] <Franciman> oh, so you are doing linear algebra
[13:45:14] <[-_-]> yes and the syllabus is a bit awkward...
[13:45:25] <Franciman> [-_-]: ok, so you can tell me what linear dependence is
[13:45:28] <Franciman> and how to check for it?
[13:46:10] <[-_-]> in terms of vectors if you can't express one vector as the scalar multiple of the other then they are linerly independent (two vectors)
[13:46:24] <[-_-]> same for functions
[13:47:41] <[-_-]> you just should not be able to make the one function/vector of a group with the other functions/vectors in that same gorup just by multiplying a saclar
[13:48:08] <[-_-]> pardon for my typing
[13:48:37] <Franciman> [-_-]: this is correct, indeed. but not so rarely we use another definition that is a bit simpler to reason about
[13:48:52] <[-_-]> so v_1+v_2+...+v_r=0
[13:48:57] <Franciman> almost there
[13:49:01] <Franciman> but you need to have coefficients too
[13:49:13] <[-_-]> so k_1 v_1+k_2 v_2+...+k_r v_r=0
[13:49:17] <[-_-]> I forgot..sorry
[13:49:18] <Franciman> ok
[13:49:21] <Franciman> no prob sar
[13:49:33] <[-_-]> so if only trivial soln exist they are linearly independent
[13:49:41] <Franciman> exactly
[13:49:45] <Franciman> so back to our life
[13:49:52] <Franciman> you have
[13:49:59] <[-_-]> cause if there are other solutions then with algebra we could express one with the other
[13:50:02] <Franciman> k_0 * 1 + k_1 * x + ... + k_n * x^n = 0
[13:50:08] <Franciman> if it had a nontrivial solution
[13:50:14] <[-_-]> yeah
[13:50:21] <Franciman> it means you have a k_i != 0
[13:50:23] <Franciman> right?
[13:50:36] <[-_-]> yeah
[13:50:37] <Franciman> so you have the polynomial
[13:50:53] <Franciman> uhm
[13:51:00] <[-_-]> okay
[13:51:05] <Franciman> wait
[13:51:07] <Franciman> for ergonomicity
[13:51:14] <Franciman> can we suppose that i is the biggest such that k_i != 0 ?
[13:51:19] <Franciman> otherwise we have to split things and go crazy
[13:51:46] <Franciman> it changes nothing, you pick the last i, such that k_i != 0
[13:51:52] <Franciman> so you can write the left hand side as:
[13:52:05] <Franciman> k_0 + k_1 * x + ... + k_i * x^{i}
[13:52:32] <[-_-]> I see no change
[13:52:47] <Franciman> perfect
[13:52:53] <Franciman> well for example i could be less than n
[13:53:02] <Franciman> ok
[13:53:04] <Franciman> so
[13:53:06] <Franciman> we have that
[13:53:14] <Franciman> k_0 + k_1 * x + ... + k_i * x^{i} = 0
[13:53:18] <Franciman> this means, and wait for it
[13:53:25] <Franciman> that the left hand side is actually the zero polynomial
[13:53:43] <Franciman> but it has degree i

[13:59:08] <Franciman> if {1, ..., x^n} are dependent
[13:59:29] <Franciman> there is a combination that gives you the 0 polynomial
[13:59:31] <Franciman> i.e.
[14:00:05] <Franciman> k_0 + k_1x + ... + k_n*x^n IS the 0 polynomial
[14:00:21] <Franciman> think of vectors
[14:00:24] <Franciman> summing those
[14:00:25] <qergle> if there were some set of non-zero coefficients that made that vanish, it would vanish for all x. meaning that nth degree poly would have infinitely many roots but we know it has at most n.

[14:01:01] <[-_-]> Franciman: so this is a definition

[14:05:20] <qergle> it's often called gauss theorem but the french call it d'alembert theorem out of national pride but d'alembert's proof was wrong and gauss fixed it.

[14:07:15] <[-_-]> So we assume if they were not zero there would be infinite roots for arbitrary coefficients
[14:07:20] <[-_-]> so they must be zero
[14:07:21] <int-e> cadmio: it doesn't say that. you have a chain of equalities; 7.15.7 is used twice, once with G = A_n and once with G = S_n.
[14:07:28] <[-_-]> and then we can take any solution we like

[17:33:16] <[-_-]> But I have one other question
[17:33:32] <PlanckWalk> [itchyjunk]: Start with z = x+iy and expand out?
[17:33:50] <[-_-]> first of all complex numbers are not vectors....hmmm....don't know why i thought that
[17:33:57] <Z-module> mh_len, so yeah, then it's a pretty trivial exercise, though I guess you need   (BC)^* = C^* B*    which maybe isn't something proved yet.
[17:34:14] <[-_-]> if they were, dot product would work for them...why doesn't it?
[17:34:44] <PlanckWalk> You can define a dot product over C if you really want
[17:34:55] <PlanckWalk> It's not often that one wants to, though.
[17:35:07] <[-_-]> there is another definition?

[17:37:06] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[17:37:35] <int-e> Z-module: how does that help? (I think this is really about the left inverse also being a right inverse... assuming A is square)
[17:37:55] <PlanckWalk> [-_-]: If you write x+iy as (x,y), then (x,y).(u,v) = xu + yv works as a dot product.
[17:38:09] <[-_-]> yeah

[18:43:20] <xormor> I understood the modulo with the clock face example. Like if it is midnight, 12AM, and I want to count forward 5 hours, then it will be 5AM instead of 17AM (that does not exist)
[18:43:23] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[18:44:18] <Z-module> yes [itchyjunk]
[18:44:41] <[itchyjunk]> oh i ended up with pi as well
[18:44:44] <Z-module> and the length of  z = cos(t) + i sin(t)   is 1, for all real t
[18:44:47] <[itchyjunk]> just made the same mistake
[18:44:53] <xormor> because I can count 12AM+12hours+5hours that is why 5 is *congruent to* 12AM+5hours *and* 12AM+12hours+5hours. It will always be 5AM instead of 17AM etc. that do not exist. The numbers can be represented by a circle, that represents the clock face in this simple example.
[18:45:15] <[itchyjunk]>  remember that   (cos(T) + i sin(T))^n = cos(nT) + i sin(nT)    for any real T, any natural n.

[19:50:50] <xormor> a is mapped to n, and n is mapped to a
[19:50:56] <xormor> they are converted thus.

[22:42:19] <LTCD> qergle I don't see what, where?
[22:42:31] <qergle> i don't know what you did with the 140 exponent reduction, you don't have (140,5)=1
[22:42:49] <qergle> LTCD: what?
[22:43:35] <LTCD> qergle Basically, my question is 205^104 mod 35. I was told to use Chinese Remainder Theorem to calculate it.
[22:43:46] <qergle> yes, and that's fine
[22:43:56] <qergle> do it (mod 5) and (mod 7) as you're doing
[22:44:01] <qergle> but the (mod 5) part you did is wrong.
[22:44:04] <LTCD> qergle So, I guessed the factors of 35 are 5*7.
[22:44:26] <qergle> fix the (mod 5) part and you should get the right answer instead of the wrong answer.
[22:44:49] <LTCD> qergle 205 = 0 mod 5 must be correct, where did I go wrong?
[22:45:08] <qergle> with that stuff you did with the 140 which is a mystery to me.
[22:45:35] <qergle> you need coprimality for flt

[22:47:14] <LTCD> qergle 0^140  mod 5 to work this out I do PHI(5)=4 then 140 = 0 mod 4
[22:47:31] <qergle> when you have a^(something) and looking mod n, you need (a,n)=1 to have that a^(phi(n))=1 (mod n)
[22:47:53] <qergle> but 205 and 5 aren't coprime!
[22:48:22] <qergle> so what is 205^4 (mod 5)?
[22:48:23] <qergle> not 1
[22:48:29] <LTCD> qergle So when I have a=205 and N=5 gcd(205,5) != 1 which means they are not coprime.
[22:49:04] <qergle> if you had a=206 for example, then 206^4=1 (mod 5) because (206,5)=1
[22:49:58] <qergle> so then you could do 140 = 0 (mod 4) and 206^140 = 206^0 = 1 (mod 5)

[22:53:57] <qergle> for the other part, you do have (205,7)=1 so then you can use flt if you wish.
[22:55:19] <LTCD> qergle 205 = 0 mod 5. 0^(140) mod 5. 140 = 0 mod 5. 0^0 = mod 5 = 1 mod 5.
[22:55:27] <qergle> in sum, you have x = 0^140 (mod 5) and x = 2^2 (mod 7)

[22:56:50] <blueberrycrop> someone here last night was trying to teach me about polynomial
[22:56:55] <LTCD> qergle Oh, so because 205 = 0 mod 5 and the 205 and 5 are not coprime I just stop?
[22:57:09] <qergle> why would you ever take 140 mod 5?
[22:57:43] <qergle> i think you need to learn why you reduce the exponent (mod phi(n))
[22:57:45] <qergle> let's do that
[22:57:59] <qergle> given (a,n)=1, we have a^(p-1)=1 (mod n)
[22:58:07] <qergle> sorry
[22:58:17] <qergle> given (a,p)=1, we have a^(p-1)=1 (mod p) [for prime p]
[22:58:21] <qergle> that's flt. ok?
[22:58:59] <qergle> so now. say we have 206^140 (mod 5). we have 5 prime and (206,5)=1, check.
[22:59:09] <qergle> therefore we know 206^4 = 1 (mod 5)
[22:59:38] <qergle> now. 140 is 4*35
[23:00:10] <qergle> so 206^(140) = (206^4)^35 = 1^35 (mod 5)
[23:00:32] <qergle> say it were 142 not 140
[23:00:47] <qergle> 142=4*35+2

[23:01:39] <qergle> 142 = 2 (mod 4)
