[01:39:09] <Berlin36> im trying to configure weechat lmao, and seems i configured autojoining too soon :)
[01:39:46] <mathu> haha the bot mostly does this to handle when someone's bnc is having connection issues and it autorejoins like three times a minute for hours. the bot bans to disrupt the auto-rejoin
[01:40:20] <Berlin36> yeah, that's understandable
[01:40:38] <Berlin36> anyways, do you know how to hide timestamps in weechat?

[02:35:30] <emmeka> Roey it doesn't need to be a name, you can use someone's profession or title or relationship to you.
[02:35:40] <Roey> ahh
[02:35:48] <Roey> emmeka: there was this one time I remember, in Chobits
[02:36:01] <Roey> emmeka: when Hideki is talking to Chii
[02:36:21] <Roey> emmeka: and he refers to her in the third person in talking directl to her, as if she's a little girl
[02:36:32] <Roey> they're in the rain at night outside
[02:36:33] <amigojapan> emmeka: I wanted to ask you, you said that just by living together, they will default you to being married in Canada, but what if you are just roomates?
[02:36:54] <Roey> oh btw my sister might get married this december :) :) :)
[02:37:57] <amigojapan> congrats Roey 
[02:38:18] <Roey> thank you amigojapan!
[02:38:22] <Roey> they got engaged last week
[02:38:34] <emmeka> amigojapan then you're still default married. in some provinces, regardless of gender.
[02:39:04] <emmeka> in practice it only matters if you declare it, but for some government things they get real nosy about it
[02:39:15] <amigojapan> wow emmeka , I dont think that is the case in the US, I had roomates for years after school
[02:39:26] <emmeka> it isn't, this is called commonlaw marriage here.
[02:39:50] <Roey> in Japan do people work on Sunday?
[02:39:53] <Roey> (in Israel they do)
[02:40:06] <Roey> (but these days, like, as of the past 20 years, Fridays are off)
[02:41:57] <amigojapan> no Roey no, people rest on both Saturday and Sunday, except jobs like convenience store workers
[02:42:25] <amigojapan> Roey: there has been talk about also making Friday off, and having a 3 day weekend
[02:42:37] <emmeka> amigojapan I had to deal with it at one point, I was applying for funding for college and they straight up asked me if I had a roommate, I said yes, and they asked me if I was in a relationship with them and how long we'd lived together

[07:37:25] <PancakeMatsuri> I'm not sure about coffee roasts, but I prefer roasted tea vs green

[07:38:01] <PancakeMatsuri> amigojapan many things do
[07:38:14] <PancakeMatsuri> amigojapan I don't like green
[07:38:18] <amigojapan> ok
[07:38:39] <MootPoot> let me put it this way PancakeMatsuri ; tea is fine, but its fine in the same way as in somebody offers you tea and there is no other option other then plain water, or you're freezing cold and there is only warm tea
[07:38:55] <MootPoot> given any personal choice I'd just take coffee / energy drink / warm milk over tea
[07:39:14] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot well, it's not clear whether you just didn't find any tea that'd appeal to you
[07:39:16] <MootPoot> its not like the worst thing, its just basically next to water on my personal tier list
[07:39:20] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I prefer coffee
[07:39:46] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but tomako is counting up all my coffee expenditures and using it gainst me
[07:39:55] <MootPoot> literally just make it yourself
[07:39:57] <amigojapan> so I said I will quit it
[07:39:58] <MootPoot> problem solved
[07:39:59] <MootPoot> lmao
[07:40:03] <MootPoot> it takes ~2min
[07:40:05] <amigojapan> MootPoot: not so easy

[07:40:23] <MootPoot> if you're capable of like basic instructions you can doit
[07:40:27] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot now, I could use some brewing advce
[07:40:50] <amigojapan> MootPoot: first of all I need to buy the water, then I need to warm it up, and I need to buy and griung the coffee beans, and filetr it somehow
[07:40:55] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot I brew coffee in a tea basket, and it turns out crappy
[07:41:21] <amigojapan> MootPoot: which also takes up electric bill
[07:41:43] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  1.) tap water 2.) hot water from tap 3.) preground coffee 4.) a simple strainer, 20 dollar coffee machine, or a plastic v60
[07:41:56] <amigojapan> MootPoot: tomako does nto allow me to drink tap water
[07:42:20] <MootPoot> then I take it you already buy water to drink normally right?
[07:42:22] <MootPoot> just use that
[07:42:24] <amigojapan> so you rplan is already messed up
[07:42:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I will just drink bottled tea instead

[07:43:06] <MootPoot> just get a cheap brita filter
[07:43:08] <MootPoot> and use that

[07:55:57] <amigojapan> ok
[07:57:22] <amigojapan> MootPoot: there is another site called lohaco which had the cheapest bottled liquid goods, way cheaper than amazon, but they recently added a "carrying fee" which made amazon cheaper
[07:57:49] <MootPoot> tbh if I were you, and you HAD to deal with all these artifical limiations
[07:57:57] <MootPoot> just buy like 300 dollars worth of bottled tea at once

[08:05:03] <MootPoot> it can
[08:05:11] <JesseDesu> yea but the details
[08:05:21] <JesseDesu> you still need to hand paint something like an anime figure
[08:05:28] <MootPoot> you need a 3d printer with multiple extruders and you need to tell it what color to print what part

[08:13:30] <amigojapan> MootPoot: can your 3d printer venen print such large parts?
[08:13:53] <amigojapan> even*
[08:14:05] <MootPoot> max size is 22cm x 22cm into 25cm
[08:14:16] <MootPoot> big enough for most
[08:14:17] <amigojapan> MootPoot: thats pretty small
[08:14:25] <amigojapan> for a latop
[08:14:36] <MootPoot> oh no, you just design the parts to connect
[08:14:47] <MootPoot> most large builds you never build it at once
[08:14:58] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'd recommend against printing a laptop case. PLA filaments aren't heat resistant. And laptop emits heat.
[08:15:10] <MootPoot> Sadale: just a open air one, just to hold the motherboard
[08:15:24] <MootPoot> Sadale: although I have a spool of PETG which is supposedly heat resistant to some degree
[08:15:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, And PLA parts may not be strong enough to hold the laptop. Anyway you could try if you want
[08:15:38] <Sadale> oh good. I've never tried PETG

[11:40:07] <JesseDesu> he looked like he was rowing a boat
[11:40:13] <Sadale> MootPoot, if the shorter print works, maybe the issue is only temporary. So you could try just repriting the bigger print
[11:40:19] <BillyZane> JesseDesu, i was probably in 3rd grade, and i saw some guy running as fast as he can past me on the side walk, and a few moments later, two cops chasing him
[11:40:30] <cgrease> i saw a guy in my city pull down his mask and casually puke on the sidewalk recently. just kept walking afterwards.

[11:42:50] <Sadale> ah let me try googling that

[11:51:33] <tcsilver> hi
[11:51:38] <Sadale> Weird. I wonder what does the filename even mean
[11:51:38] <tcsilver> I'll try to go watch a movie
[11:51:48] <Sadale> I thought that 3.5h meant 3.5 hours
[11:51:50] <tcsilver> it's the secret of tai chi
[11:51:53] <MootPoot> Me 2
[11:52:22] <Sadale> Anyway it's known that the file comes with the SD card are huge. You'd probably be better of printing other smaller models online :P
[11:52:28] <Nanobot> I have a confession to make... when Calli and Bae said "Captain Underpants", I too heard "cats in underpants". In fact, as soon as Calli and Bae said it, I paused the video (I was watching the archive) and searched Google Images for "cats in underpants", noticed there was nothing there about books, searched again for "cats in underpants book", and then resumed the video and watched Calli and Bae laugh hysterically at IRyS for doing the exact same thing I 
[11:52:28] <Nanobot> just did.

[11:54:23] <Sadale> nice :3 Let's hope that it'd work correctly. :3 :3

[11:56:56] <MootPoot> Sadale: what I dont get is how the fuck it ended up on the floor 
[11:57:03] <MootPoot> Like 2m away 
[11:57:17] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh wait. When you said the floor you mean the floor floor. I thought that you meant hotbed.
[11:57:23] <MootPoot> Did the Ender 3 just decide "fuck it" and flung it at far as it could?
[11:57:35] <MootPoot> Sadale: no it was literally on the floor 
[11:57:49] <MootPoot> The printer was spewing out more filament trying to complete it

[11:59:10] <Sadale> MootPoot, I guess it could be bed leveling issue, or heatbed temperature issue. Basically the problem is that the cat couldn't stick to the hotbed hard enough.
[11:59:37] <Sadale> MootPoot, Anyway the cat print looks unusual. Notice how the pattern on the base of the cat. It isn't a solid pattern. It makes it stick less to the hotbed.
[11:59:53] <MootPoot> In the gcode it's supposed to be solid?
[12:00:13] <Sadale> In the gcode I have no idea. I suspect that yours is correct. So I'd say the gcode could be problematic.
[12:00:14] <MootPoot> Hmm...could it be a trait of the filament

[12:01:16] <MootPoot> The temps were in the filament spec but on the lower end of it
[12:01:29] <MootPoot> Maybe raise the bed temp
[12:02:15] <Sadale> MootPoot, what's your printing temperature for the filament and bed?
[12:02:44] <MootPoot> It was the default pla settings
[12:02:47] <Sadale> For bed I think I used 55C or 60C for the stock hotbed. I couldn't remember.
[12:02:51] <MootPoot> 200 and 50
[12:02:58] <Sadale> ah 200C should be fine.
[12:04:39] <Sadale> If that's the case I'd recommend not to print the cat model again. I'd like to rule out the possibility that the feet of the cat is causing the issue. Instead print something else online. Slice the model on your own with Cura.

[16:53:53] <Sadale> So is $200. plus you may have to pay for export tax and shit.
[16:54:08] <Sadale> Oh and there's lithium battery inside. Not sure if you could ship it internationally.
[16:54:29] <JesseDesu> i dont trust your government's postal system to delivery properly on their end

[16:54:52] <JesseDesu> yea lithium batteries

[17:51:31] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: there's probably a way of reducing that steppedness
[17:51:54] <MootPoot> More heat?
[17:51:57] <SpiritOfSummer> all this beer talk makes me think tonight is not a bad night to get some liquor
[17:52:01] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: yeah
[17:52:05] <Sadale> MootPoot, I think you're probably supposed to remove the feet.
[17:52:07] <SpiritOfSummer> but it actually is a bad night for that 
[17:52:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: sand paper
[17:52:17] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: what's happening is the lower layers are cooling down too fast before new layers applied

[17:59:22] <amigojapan> Google assumes users know what it is, instead of putting a title like "Google search engine
[18:00:47] <amigojapan> Sadale: my client recently made a search engine for private use, one for only searching single board computers
[18:01:12] <SpiritOfSummer> if I were google I would have named it infinity
[18:01:50] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: Google is good as a verb
[18:01:58] <Sadale> amigojapan, what didy ou mena?
[18:02:09] <SpiritOfSummer> well the thing is google is a number
[18:02:17] <SpiritOfSummer> "you should 17 that" 
[18:02:19] <Sadale> amigojapan, so it only contains the name of single board computers?
[18:02:26] <Sadale> That you could only search for single board computers?
[18:02:39] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: but yeah at this point it's more known as it's search engine and not the number
[18:02:49] <SpiritOfSummer> so it is quite literally a verb now
[18:03:05] <amigojapan> Sadale: he made a search engine for searching data about single board computers, either by name or by specs
[18:04:07] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: I think the number had a slight different spelling, I think it is googol
[18:04:24] <amigojapan> But I suck at spelling
[18:05:02] <SpiritOfSummer> amigojapan: that is correct and I had no idea about that
[18:05:08] <Sadale> amigojapan, ah! cool! :3
[18:05:37] <SpiritOfSummer> I wonder how many illions there are before googol
[18:05:47] <SpiritOfSummer> googol has 100 zeros behind it
[18:05:55] <SpiritOfSummer> so 101 digits I guess
[18:06:08] <amigojapan> Sadale: he made it cause his boss asked him to make a spread sheet with over 1000 entries by hand about single board computers
[18:06:17] <SpiritOfSummer> technically speaking, that actually makes it ten-something-illion
[18:06:30] <Sadale> amigojapan, pffft
[18:06:34] <SpiritOfSummer> wait 100
[18:06:37] <Sadale> amigojapan, by hand lol
[18:06:39] <SpiritOfSummer> 100 something illion
[18:06:40] <Sadale> tedious af
[18:07:10] <Sadale> There gotta be an easier way to do that. I bet that such kind of database/table already exist somewhere on the web
[18:07:26] <amigojapan> Yup Sadale he would have had to type it all. And then it would just have been a spread sheet

[20:03:41] <emmeka> Bco1981 I seen a few prebuilts with that processor *and* a GPU, and I almost wonder if it'd make more sense to buy one, and then resell the GPU for like half the value I paid for the PC and then just use the onboard graphics.
[20:04:04] <Bco1981> emmeka: lol yeah you could do that.
[20:04:34] <Bco1981> because that old cpu you have, is getting old.

[20:52:58] <emmeka> the network we knew as Freenode is dead, literally. rasengan shut it down.
[20:53:11] <JesseDesu> i want a raisin gun
[20:53:33] <emmeka> ZariskiDense they basically started a completely new network, that is just also called Freenode. All previous registrations are gone.
[20:53:51] <Dap> freenode's dead as fuck
[20:57:41] <JesseDesu> wow i watched this movie like 6 times on vhs in 4th grade

[20:59:44] <JesseDesu> n
[21:00:04] <ZariskiDense> emmeka: That is fine (who cares about names anyway?), but does the new Freenode have any significant community to speak of?
[21:00:32] <ZariskiDense> Of programmers, gamers or whatever.
[21:00:51] <Bco1981> weebs 'n' neets
[21:01:04] <Dap> all the FOSS projects and languages have moved over, and discord is more popular with gamers
[21:01:24] <ZariskiDense> Ah, what a pity.
[21:01:47] <Dap> i'd be really surprised if there's any significant following. rasengan's kinda out of his mind.
[21:01:56] <emmeka> ZariskiDense "name" isn't the issue, all previous channels are gone. all previous users are gone. the entire network and everyone who could connect to it is gone. anyone currently on new Freenode had to register with services like a new user and register their channel as if it was new.
[21:02:15] <emmeka> ZariskiDense but no, last I heard there was <3000 users on new Freenode
[21:02:41] <ZariskiDense> emmeka: Yes, I know that old communities have moved to other places, but I wanted to know if maybe there was also an interesting new community. But all the evidence points towards ‚Äúno‚Äù.
[21:02:56] <emmeka> and that most of them are just people from Libera, hoping to catch any randos that show up and direct them here. And new Freenode apparently k-lines on site for any mention of Libera

[21:04:07] <JesseDesu> ok i watched 30 minutes of little nemo
[21:04:15] <emmeka> ZariskiDense yeah. rasengan's behaviour is kind of inexplicable. he actually probably could have taken over Freenode and caused a real split if he hadn't done things that were so obviously unacceptable and actively hindered use of the network
[21:04:19] <Dap> ZariskiDense, he seems to have been under the impression that he could improve freenode and IRC by being a "strong" leader for the movement. These people had no need of such a leader, and weren't interested.
