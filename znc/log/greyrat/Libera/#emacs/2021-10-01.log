[02:07:13] <bremner> aidalgol: you can think of it as an additional argument of a function to call instead of returning
[02:07:35] <mattf> what would the any function be in emacs? Take a sequence, run a function for each element and if any is t or non nil then return t

[03:36:40] <grym>     Oh, that's easy, the optimists. Oh, they were the ones who said, 'We're going to be out by Christmas.' And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go. Then they'd say, 'We're going to be out by Easter.' And Easter would come, and Easter would go. And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be Christmas again. And they died of a broken heart. This is a very important lesson. You must never confuse faith

[07:39:13] <acdw> fun fact: snake oil actually does work, the actual snake oil
[07:39:17] <Bayes> hmm
[07:39:30] <acdw> the people were originally arrested for selling fake snake oil

[07:41:46] <acdw> chinese water snakes are high in like, omega-3's which is good for joint pain
[07:42:09] <dale> acdw: OK, OK, that article is kind of interesting, though I don't like the thought of... extraction.
[07:42:11] <acdw> the theory is chinese workers in the US would boil snakes and use it, and then white people were like Ooooh
[07:42:29] <acdw> dale: it's the same for fish oil, or for that matter peanut oil, safflower oil ...
[07:42:32] <acdw> all are extracted

[12:58:42] <famubu> I was trying to make an evil mode keybinding to switch to last active buffer. Equivalent of the default `C-x b RET`. I did `(evil-global-set-key 'normal (kbd "gl") 'switch-to-buffer)`. It works okay but is there a way to make the prompt asking for confirmatin of buffer name go away just for this?

[16:30:37] <Bayes> You may be surprised: but hypnosis is the strongest over the counter pain reliever.

[16:31:02] <Bayes> that's the first hit, search engines gah
[16:31:58] <grym> one of my favorite ignobel awards centers on the finding that if you tell people the placebo sugar pills you give them cost $10/pill, they work better than if you tell them they cost $1/pill

[20:09:24] <ldlework> I gripped the flight controls and looked out at the armada before me. I had always been curious about the next big thing in the sky. I had seen it in the news, glimpsed it in the stars, but never once had I imagined that it would be me. I kept waiting for the doubt, for the fear that I might do something wrong, something dangerous, but it never came. And now, I had been selected from the thousands
[20:09:26] <ldlework> of hopeful pilots who had applied. I had been accepted to the Academy, and I knew that this was the opportunity of a life time. I had seen it all before. The people who wanted it, the people who didn't. The dreams, the hopes, and the dashed dreams. This was my chance to be the best, to be the first, and to change the world (or at least, that's what they said). " onset, sixty seconds. " said the
[20:09:28] <ldlework> calm, but firm voice of the tower. I took my hands off the flight controls, and gripped the yoke. In the distance, I could see the silhouettes of the fighters assembled in formation. Theirs was the first turn, and they were anxious to begin. " green light " I pulled back on the yoke. The ship lurched forward, and the fighters flowed gracefully into their attack positions. Everything was going

[23:01:26] <bpalmer> krux02_: in many cases, it's easiest to simply shadow the entry in the list; most alist access functions will take the first matching entry.
[23:01:41] <Catie> johnjay: oh definitely not, and all sorts of people have been implementing their idea of what the "best we can do" is for a very long time

[23:01:46] <krux02> johnjay, I just entered here, do you mean language design wise?
[23:02:05] <bpalmer> krux02: so, e.g., (alist-get 'a '((a . 1) (a . 2))) => 1
[23:02:15] <Catie> all the lisps serve different purposes
[23:02:27] <bpalmer> krux02: in which case, you can shadow it by simply consing a new cell to the front

[23:03:14] <johnjay> krux02: yeah. like reading the rationale document for making fennel is interesting. no early returns etc
[23:03:18] <johnjay> https://fennel-lang.org/rationale
[23:03:28] <bpalmer> krux02: otherwise, you have to either mutate an existing cell in the alist (which may be bad if shared elsewhere); or create a new list omitting the entry you want to edit, and then cons the new cell in front
[23:03:48] <krux02> johnjay, you mean the programming language fennel?
[23:03:51] <bpalmer> krux02: if you insert a normalization step periodically , you can provide an amortized bound to the cost.
[23:03:55] <johnjay> indeed
[23:03:59] <krux02> ah yes just saw the link
[23:04:12] <krux02> bpalmer, and how do I normalize?
[23:04:18] <johnjay> i'm not saying we should get rid of common lisp and scheme and use clojure and fennel.
[23:04:28] <johnjay> but i'm basically saying that
