[17:28:21] <Guest10> Hello, everyone! How are you all? I hope you're all well. I have this problem with SpaceVim. Javascript autocompletion does not display a popup menu with the correspondent list of variables, functions, objects, etc. I did what the internet guide specifies it has to be done in order to make autocompletion work, which is adding two lines in
[17:28:21] <Guest10> SpaceVim.vim. It does not work. Have you got any ideas, please?

[19:16:47] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> @Sunshine  maybe we should add a layer option for it.
