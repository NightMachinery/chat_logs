[00:00:58] <AsenMx> slaughter, how do you get around building documentation that is not really necessary? Like documenting very simple stuff that shoud be common knowledge?
[00:02:25] <slaughter> You've gotta trust your coworkers to document the right things. Probably let some stuff get done that doesn't fit the bill (too much detail, too little detail, horrible formatting, etc) and then present to the team and assess what could be done better
[00:03:09] <rawtaz> AsenMx: i have to ask what make everyone leave?
[00:03:10] <slaughter> There might be some common wisdom around this that I"m not aware of. But the extra time spent documenting what "should be common knowledge" (it probably isn't, fwiw) isn't wasted - not having _any_ documentation is wasting time.
[00:03:43] <AsenMx> rawtaz, the chaos that is in the team (that's what everyone said)
[00:03:53] <rawtaz> ok
[00:04:16] <slaughter> AsenMx so I assume you're the senior/lead/whatever now? IE you have some say in process etc?
[00:05:02] <AsenMx> we are chasing deadlines and there is a specific guy for specific task when he leaves nobody knows his stuff and it takes more time to do the work, meaning more pressure from deadlines and stuff just piles up and another guy leaves and yeah you get that avalanche/snowball effect
[00:05:53] <AsenMx> slaughter, yeah, something like that i have backup from managment 
[00:06:16] <slaughter> In that case you might benefit from some books
[00:06:42] <slaughter> If you want to turn the ship around you're going to want a more holistic view
[00:07:20] <slaughter> In the meantime, just start implementing new processes that get people in the habit of documenting/testing/communicating/etc
[00:07:46] <AsenMx> the communication part fails badly people don't want to talk to each other 
[00:07:53] <slaughter> And trust your team. It _will not_ work if you don't. Don't go rule-crazy. More like authoritative suggestions
[00:07:59] <slaughter> Remote team?
[00:08:31] <AsenMx> yeah remote team 1-3 people per office (multiple locations) some are completely remote 
[00:09:09] <AsenMx> so sometimes those that are together in the office talk (most of the time they don't) but the rest of the team is left out ... 
[00:10:07] <slaughter> That's a tough one. First: cameras on - I hate this but it makes a huge difference. Second: at least 1 hour a week of some kind of social thing with as many team members as possible - a good starting point is tech talk watch parties or a book club or even just a happy hour. Not at 4pm or 5pm, but at like 2pm to start. You've gotta build the culture along with the processes
[00:10:22] <AsenMx> we have 0 communication 0 documentation and 0 knowledge share... it gets harder every day. Can't figure a way to spread the knowledge 
[00:11:08] <AsenMx> we have every friday happy hours, people rather leave earlier than stay and talk with the team 
[00:11:30] <AsenMx> it is supposed to be 2 hours but people usually stay in the call like 15min and then they leave 
[00:11:36] <slaughter> Yeah so do them Thursday at 2pm
[00:12:14] <AsenMx> people will make excuse they are busy and not come at all
[00:13:23] <AsenMx> tried that with tech meetings where we can discuss tasks/problems/tech related stuff, we have meeting booked every day, and nobody shows up. I've used it once in the past 3 months (there is nobody there)
[00:14:32] <slaughter> If it's not fixing an outage or work the CEO is breathing down their neck, then what is their excuse? Follow up with people. "Hey, I noticed you didn't join happy hour. We had a really good time talking and learning about our teammates, we'd love to see you there next time."
[00:14:55] <slaughter> After a few misses you can start making it clear that their lack of attendance is affecting the team overall. 
[00:15:05] <rawtaz> AsenMx: have you considered having a 1-on-1 call with each person in the team, and simply ask them how they feel about the status of everything, how they would want to improve it and what would make them happy and motivated? instead of trying to thikn these things up yourself.
[00:15:05] <slaughter> You can't let shitty culture like that fester
[00:15:21] <slaughter> rawtaz fire suggestion
[00:15:45] <slaughter> Not like "suggest you'll fire them" but your suggestion was in fact ðŸ”¥
[00:16:17] <rawtaz> the important thing there (for starters) is to make them feel assured that it's between you and them (for staretrs, there can be more public follow-ups later) and that they can say anything they want without any form of reprimand or similar.
[00:16:31] <rawtaz> slaughter: i take that as a good thing :-)
[00:16:44] <slaughter> Yes indeed :)
[00:16:45] <AsenMx> rawtaz, tried that people say they are good. Management does that 2 times a week, everyone says everything is good, but people complain there is no documentation/knowledge share whatever the work is not getting done. I come up with some ideas people just don't care, they don't give any better ideas either.
[00:17:29] <rawtaz> right. they basically gave up and are in ad-hoc fix whatever needs fixing mode then?
[00:18:56] <AsenMx> Right, to me looks like they have absolutely zero passion. Some of them don't even have computer at their home. However it is not up to me to replace them, all i can do is just try to figure out a way to make it work.
[00:19:04] <rawtaz> i dont think that management talking with them has any useful effect. whats needed is bonding between you and them :) maybe if you have such talks with them and make it clear that youre all on the same "it's misery" page, and freely discuss how to turn that ship around 100% (as in, employ new fun tech etc that motivates them)
[00:19:26] <rawtaz> what work do those having no computer at home do? they have computers at work office i suppose?
[00:19:27] <slaughter> Do you have any team players? People that are trying? 
[00:21:01] <rawtaz> perhaps rolling up your sleeves and starting to work on something that needs doing, using some interesting tech, and then asking key folks to help with piece by piece can loosen it up a bit
[00:22:24] <AsenMx> rawtaz, yeah they have work computers, i meant they don't have any personal computer. So when they leave their work machine at the office, that means they don't do any IT related stuff outside of work. Imo that means zero passion. 
[00:22:51] <AsenMx> slaughter, all the team players left, because there was lack of team play.
[00:24:32] <rawtaz> it may mean zero passion but it's not a given or certain. i know plenty folks who never sit by their computer at home, yet work nicely at work
[00:26:03] <AsenMx> rawtaz, i agree with you. I don't say you have to be working in your free time, however I personally like to read blogs, read about new tech, code personal projects and overall develop my professional skills.
[00:26:16] <slaughter> So your entire devops team doesn't want to do any of the necessary work at this point? No one other than you is putting in effort at all? 
[00:27:14] <slaughter> I would find that to be questionable, to be honest. You've probably got people that aren't having goals realized etc due to the culture you're working in that would shine if given the chance
[00:28:12] <AsenMx> We all close our tickets, some close them on time some are a late. But nobody is putting "EXTRA" effort into things. There are 1 or 2 lone wolfs that do amazing job, but  they are just outsiders don't like people (basement sysadmins).
[00:28:13] <rawtaz> AsenMx: yeah i get it. im just trying to point out that you cannot make assumptions about others passion based in your own personal preferences :D
[00:28:54] <rawtaz> i think you need to take one thing at a time. you cant turn this around at once, you have to make small changes one by one that makes people happier and more motivated. try to solve one small part of the puzzle at a time
[00:29:41] <AsenMx>  rawtaz where to start? what you think is the one thing that will take least efforts and have best reward?
[00:30:15] <slaughter> Sounds to me like documentation and knowledge share are the big pain points right now, so probably start there
[00:30:50] <AsenMx> and how to share knowledge when people don't want to talk to each other? 
[00:32:23] <slaughter> Setup knowledge share meetings. Half an hour on Tuesday before lunch. Someone has to present _something_ - whether it's something about an internal tool/app/process they know/learned recently/want people to see or just "here's how I've setup my IDE to work with Azure better". Round robin if you have no volunteers
[00:33:57] <rawtaz> AsenMx: honestly i still think you need to have a deeper talk with your colleagues
[00:34:31] <rawtaz> try to find what piece of software or tech theyd find interesting to work on
[00:36:08] <slaughter> Yeah for what it's worth here I'm referencing what I've seen work in organizations that already have good culture, though a lot of it's what was used to build that culture
[00:36:15] <AsenMx> rawtaz, will try thank you.
[00:37:34] <AsenMx> its easy when there is a culture already or at least few people that try ... at some point rest just follow but right now our oldest employee is 3 months old 
[00:37:55] <rawtaz> FWIW i have no clue what  im talking about or the things im suggesting :)
[00:38:31] <rawtaz> the interesting thing is that with such a fresh team you guys have all chances in the world to set things up the way you want. i guess the main disconnect is the social aspect in the team
[00:38:59] <slaughter> Yeah wow 3 months as the most senior? The world is your oyster dude, you can fix this right up
[00:39:05] <rawtaz> can you perhaps find some small projects that need doing and then put two people each on them? hoping that it will bond pairs of people
[00:41:22] <AsenMx> rawtaz, that is a bit hard since i don't have official authority to do that. We have a manager that assigns who works  on what. I tried to ask for help with a ticket (I was pretty capable to do it myself) just so we can work together, but the other guy tried to slack.
[00:42:03] <rawtaz> try different combinations of pairs :L)
[00:42:04] <rawtaz> :)*
[00:42:58] <slaughter> You as the team lead don't have the authority to determine who works on what? wut
[00:43:17] <slaughter> Do _you_ like this job?
[00:44:27] <AsenMx> slaughter, I like the stuff i do at work, however i don't like when the team struggles. I'm not an official team lead or anything like that. 
[00:45:03] <slaughter> Does management understand the struggle and that you're hoping to fix it?
[00:46:06] <AsenMx> slaughter, yeah the management tries quite hard. We had multiple meetings where everyone can give suggestions what and when and how to improve. Everyone is staying quiet. Management tries hard, but without much results. 
[00:47:20] <slaughter> Yet you don't have the authority to make decisions like who gets what work on your team, even though you're effectively the senior/lead? 
[00:47:27] * slaughter smells red flags
[00:48:27] <AsenMx> slaughter, we have "delivery" manager for that role. He basically shovels the task in our plate. I can just say something like "it is not a good idea to give that task to person X give it to person Y instead. 
[00:49:11] <slaughter> That sounds like an overpowered PM
[00:49:48] <rawtaz> AsenMx: meetings with multiple people is not constructive. you have to break it down to individual persons, get their trust and comfort, to hear what they really think.
[00:49:59] <rawtaz> collective meetings == pointless at this time
[00:50:01] <slaughter> People can't choose the work they want to work on? That sounds like a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge barrier to getting people involved
[00:50:42] <AsenMx> slaughter, no no they can, on daily manager asks  who wants to get ticket X everyone stays quited so he just puts it on someone  who doesn't have much work. 
[00:51:20] * slaughter smells a field of red flags
[00:51:33] <rawtaz> whatever it is, something is terribly wrong :D
[00:51:40] <rawtaz> probably a lot of different factors involved
[00:51:41] <AsenMx> slaughter, then the manager goes 1 to 1 with me and he is "why is everyone quiet nobody wants to take the tasks" 
[00:52:56] <AsenMx> oh there are multiple red flags, but i will keep trying for the next 3-6 months and eventually if it doesn't work i will move on.
[00:54:20] <slaughter> Definitely need to break things down into smaller chunks - and that may mean breaking your team into sub-teams (scrum-ish). Getting more info/involvement from individuals, better planned/scheduled social events, etc
[00:54:52] <slaughter> Sounds like some of the issues are coming from on high so you're probably going to have do a little shoe licking to get what you need. 
[00:55:39] <AsenMx> slaughter, yeah and now our cto left, new one will come that will have "his way" we will see how it goes. 
[00:55:47] <slaughter> Not some...it sounds like the majority of your issues are coming from your superiors in the company. You also probably need an official title if you're going to effect any change
[00:55:54] <AsenMx> ny the way i appreciate the talk we have guys it is really useful to me
[00:56:17] <slaughter> Yeah dude sounds gnarly but also that would be wicked satisfying to fix
[00:56:51] <AsenMx> its been few years since i had such motivation to build a good team 
[00:57:36] *** Quits: humky (~humky@user/humky) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:57:42] <AsenMx> i usually go "I don't give a fuck, not my problem" but this one case i really want to make everything work
[00:58:57] <slaughter> Worst case scenario you give it a shot, learn some things, and do it better next time!
[01:01:03] <AsenMx> yeah, we will see how it goes :) 
[01:01:31] <rawtaz> good luck, and kudos for not giving up
[01:01:33] <AsenMx> made a list of 20+ points that i should look into tnx to you guys. 
[01:01:49] <slaughter> Good luck! Report back in a few weeks and let us know how it's going!
[01:01:51] <AsenMx> thank you so much for the help  and talk 
[01:04:03] <rawtaz>  yw
[01:04:07] <AsenMx> okay i have one more specific question. How do you deal with coworker that lack skills, he gives wrong answers to questions in the team chat. For example you ask a question how to load test a web server and he gives you link to a digital ocean apche install guide or something like that. 
[01:04:13] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: CTO left too?
[01:04:25] <rawtaz> oh my god
[01:04:35] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: Aww, sounds like you got yourself into a pickle. I wonder what happened to trigger this mass exodus. :)
[01:04:36] <AsenMx> kwilczynski, yeah whole ops team + CTO haha 
[01:04:42] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: Hang in there, though.
[01:05:14] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: I can only add based on my experience - depending on whether things are stable... or everything is on fire.
[01:05:16] <rawtaz> AsenMx: i guess talk with him and explain that he is lacking the skills required and that providing inaccurate information is counter-helpful. to give him the benefit of the doubt.
[01:05:57] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: You might want tackle keeping the sheep afloat first as priority and then adding best practice.
[01:06:09] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: Otherwise it might be hard to do it if you and others are now.
[01:06:19] *** Joins: humky (~humky@user/humky)
[01:06:23] <AsenMx> rawtaz, i tried that he just told me  something which i roughly translete to "you are too stupid and don't understand the documentation i provide" 
[01:06:33] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: Plus, in due process of keeping the lights on, you might learn things inside-out and then improve... gradually.
[01:07:34] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: What I mean... sometimes it's OK not to have sprints and follow stupid SCRUM things for the sake of keeping things work. :)
[01:07:50] <rawtaz> AsenMx: in that case, no reason to waste more energy on an incompetent person. gather a meeting with relevant parties to explain the situation such that they can tell him to improve or get lost
[01:08:21] <rawtaz> people who are stupid or imcompetent AND doesnt have the ability to realize it themselves, they are completely useless and shouldnt be wasted time on
[01:08:51] <kwilczynski> Yes! We should send them to Australia!
[01:08:52] <rawtaz> (just make sure youre right, lol)
[01:08:53] <AsenMx> rawtaz, management will get rid of him once we have new hands right now he closes some tickets so he is good enough, but the constant missinformation he provies just triggers me. I see the rest of the team ignores him, however i kind of pisses me off. 
[01:08:57] <kwilczynski> Oh wait... we did that already.
[01:08:59] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:09:03] <rawtaz> AsenMx: ok fair enough :)
[01:09:07] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: exactly!
[01:09:43] <rawtaz> AsenMx: then the answer is to just correct him when he's wrong/giving wrong info, and hope he's gone soon
[01:09:54] <kwilczynski> Who is this bad apple?
[01:09:57] <kwilczynski> CTO?
[01:10:02] <kwilczynski> CEO?
[01:10:33] <AsenMx> kwilczynski, no idea when i joined the company it was on fire :) the day i started few people anounced they are leaving :) 
[01:11:01] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: Oh dear me.
[01:11:12] <AsenMx> then few more followed the coming month 
[01:13:12] <AsenMx> rawtaz, yes but this is kind of annoying. Over the years i had few coworkers that were like that, tried different methods and none worked. Eventually they got fired or i left. But looks like this is the only solution, which is kind of sad. Was hoping any of you had success dealing with such people.
[01:14:24] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: Who is this person?
[01:14:28] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: Your team member?
[01:14:36] *** Quits: sniperwolf (~sniperwol@91.230.98.1) (Quit: Client closed)
[01:15:36] <AsenMx> yeah haha 
[01:15:50] <kwilczynski> Why would he torpedo your work?
[01:16:04] <kwilczynski> Disgruntles employee? Missed a promotion or something?
[01:16:18] <kwilczynski> Disgruntled
[01:16:37] <AsenMx> no idea i see he switched many jobs in the last years longest he stayed is 1 year 
[01:16:48] <AsenMx> so i guess he is just like that?
[01:16:49] <rawtaz> AsenMx: yeah. they're simply too ignorant, stupid or similar to understand it themselves, and there's no turning that around
[01:17:32] <kwilczynski> Hmm.
[01:17:40] <kwilczynski> Yeah, some people are like that.
[01:18:01] <kwilczynski> I never quite figured out what are the key personality traits in such people.
[01:18:34] <AsenMx> this remind me of a moment few years ago at previous job we had same guy (sysadmin on my team) he once stormed CEO/CTO one to one meeting and started telling them how to run their budget 
[01:18:58] <kwilczynski> ... did the listened?
[01:18:58] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:19:01] <kwilczynski> they*
[01:19:41] <AsenMx> nah i remember our cto comming to our room getting some whiskey and invited us to drink instead  of bothering with this dude
[01:19:58] *** Quits: gh34 (~textual@cpe-184-58-181-106.wi.res.rr.com) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[01:21:05] <kwilczynski> Sometimes... the winning move is not to play.
[01:21:09] <AsenMx> no idea if its just me but in every company there is one guy like this 
[01:21:12] <kwilczynski> Also, reminds me of https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshuaFluke1's videos.
[01:21:13] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:21:28] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: No. It's not you.
[01:21:37] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: It's systemic in this industry.
[01:22:09] <AsenMx> i believe if you don't spot the "know it all dude" most like you are the one xD
[01:22:24] <kwilczynski> High egos, primadonna behaviour, 10x engineers, the know-it-alls, back-stabbers, etc.
[01:22:36] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: Depends.
[01:22:51] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: If you are know-it-all and have no ego, and help others... then you are a decent engineer/human being.
[01:23:08] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: If in return you expect some sort of worship... then you can go fly a kite.
[01:23:16] <AsenMx> how do you know if you show no ego? I sometimes be "know it all guy" 
[01:23:58] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: I am not an expert in spotting amazing altruistic engineers.
[01:24:05] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: But I think you know what I mean.
[01:24:50] <kwilczynski> People who are kind, senior and one can learn form them, plus are open to accepting other people's point of views/opinions are golden.
[01:24:53] <kwilczynski> Such people I had in mind.
[01:25:05] <kwilczynski> A lot of senior people have bad egos and are on a power trip.
[01:25:20] <AsenMx> I often have opinion about pretty much everything. I don't always express it, but when i do i go like this: This is great idea, lets do it, but if it was me i would most like try to do it X way. Do i look like asshole from the side?
[01:25:45] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: Do you throw a tantrum if someone says "no" or disagrees? :)
[01:25:55] <kwilczynski> If so, then yes... and get professional help.
[01:25:55] <AsenMx> I usually finish with "I have no idea if i'm right, that's just how i would do it if i were you"
[01:26:13] <kwilczynski> If not, then are fine. 
[01:26:35] <kwilczynski> I had few people I worked with who would throw things.
[01:26:37] <kwilczynski> During meetings.
[01:26:42] <kwilczynski> Because people disagree.
[01:26:55] <kwilczynski> Or could detach themselves on personal level from code reviews.
[01:27:09] <kwilczynski> And would go into rage because someone mage a comment on their PR.
[01:27:12] <AsenMx> if someone says "NO" i ask for explanation if they give me reasonable answer which happens in like 50% of the times i say okay lets roll your way. 
[01:28:05] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: Tell me... what is the plan for fixing your bad sheep and rescuing your team?
[01:29:14] <AsenMx> this is a long discussion and well i will start by speaking 1 to 1 with everyone on monday.
[02:02:30] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: :)
[02:02:32] <kwilczynski> AsenMx: \o/
