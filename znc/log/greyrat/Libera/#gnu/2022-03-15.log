[18:39:14] <isf> the public domain isnt a license
[18:39:39] <epony> isf, according to whom?
[18:40:13] <isf> is the status of work without copyright.
[18:40:43] <epony> incorrect, see previous publicly linked pages
[18:40:50] <yrk> isf is correct. public domain is not a license.
[18:40:57] <epony> yrk, wrong
[18:41:10] <isf> and the only way for have free software is put a free software license.
[18:41:43] <epony> there are license that place works in the public domain too, though you do not need to put it explicitly through a license, you can just say it is public domain and that's all
[18:41:53] <epony> isf, and yrk, you're both wrong
[18:42:01] <epony> update your outdated information ^
[18:42:08] <isf> the public domain status dont protec, dont defend and dont put freedom, en anycase the public domain dont help and dont do nothing, is just the status of a work or art etc without copyright.

[18:50:14] <epony> fossdev2, don't forget to ask your question at other organisations too, you might hear a different more complete explanation about licenses that are not authored by the GNU and are still approved by FSF

[18:51:57] <epony> did you see the comparison link?
[18:52:56] <fossdev2> i am here because gplv3 is one of the most complete license and is very clear.
[18:53:04] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licences#Approvals and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licences#Approvals
[18:53:32] <epony> fossdev2, that is very funny, hahahahahahahahaha
[18:53:55] <jxself> Although FSF, OSI, Debian and Fedora have different criteria. While the different criteria often seem to result in the same practical outcome this is not always the case.
[18:54:21] <jxself> And someone may desire to follow the criteria that they believe in more than some other organization's criteria.
[18:56:09] <epony> sounds good to have choices
[18:56:15] <jxself> That "criteria", of course, being software freedom.
[18:56:26] <jxself> I could start the Gratis Software Foundation for example which says software should be gratis and probably approve many of the same but not all licenses.
[18:57:06] <epony> there is no public domain foundation though
[18:57:34] <jxself> Choice is good but when there are difference in underlying philosophy, sometimes extreme, we can't actually appeal to choice itself as a value. But more which one's actually better for society.
[18:58:04] <epony> correction: for the goals of the respective "organisation"
[18:58:18] <epony> since there is no "social software foundation" either
[18:58:52] <epony> the society's interests are broad and there are many societies
[18:59:36] <epony> in the public good / public domain seems to be least restrictive in that (not mandating restrictions by licensing)
[19:00:56] *** Joins: filename (~kilitary@188.242.105.134)
[19:01:42] <epony> I think it is the right of the respective foundation to define their terms and licensing preferences, but there are even foundations that have goals and objectives to remove copyright for software altogether, and until then use anti-copyright licenses and even public domain software examples as proof that it really works.
[19:01:46] *** Joins: kts (~kts@103.73.237.12)
[19:02:15] <epony> so, all foundations are equal but some foundations goals and objectives are more equal than those of the others

[19:07:36] <epony> fossdev2, that would mean you write your own, take the "unlicense" and modify it, although such is discouraged for "license proliferation" and difficulties in acceptance

[23:30:46] <tesseract> isf: what should i do?
[23:31:20] <isf> i recommend GNU IceCat and Abrowser
[23:31:30] <Kaiod> tesseract: Hello, I strongly recommend not (https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html), why would you want to install it? have you thought about using free browsers (https://libreplanet.org/wiki/Libre_Browsers_Libre_Formats)?

[23:34:10] <tesseract> isf: just like that? aren't there other things you want to tell?
[23:35:16] <Base36_Manifesto> always disable javascript?
[23:35:59] <Kaiod> Base36_Manifesto: Or use the LibreJS extension
[23:36:19] <tesseract> if you want slow connection
[23:36:34] <tesseract> speed
[23:37:09] <tesseract> instead, use noscript
[23:37:56] <Kaiod> Have you ever thought about using GNUzilla? (https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/)
[23:38:22] <Base36_Manifesto> if someone made libreflash id' suggest that over librejs
