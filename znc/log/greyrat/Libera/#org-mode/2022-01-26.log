[09:59:50] <dirtcastle> Symbol’s function definition is void: org-file-name-concat.and the thing is if I load the init file after changes for the first time it loads properly. If I close emacs and open it , this error shows.

[10:59:15] <corwin> oops, no it's #org-mode.  Gosh, that's confusing.
[11:00:33] <empwilli> dirtcastle: afaik this function has been dropped from org-mode, had the issue a while back, as well.
[11:01:03] <dirtcastle> i used org-reload and it fixed the error for me
[11:01:21] <empwilli> hm
[11:01:37] <empwilli> C-h f doesn't show any info to this function, though
[11:02:29] <dirtcastle> exactly
[11:02:47] <dirtcastle> no solution in the internet fixed this. 
[11:03:19] <dirtcastle> I asked this multiple times in here and emacs and only now I found this workaround
[11:05:13] <empwilli> do you know from where this function is invoked?
[11:05:26] <empwilli> have you recently updated your setup (packages, emacs, ...)?
[11:06:05] <empwilli> I got some really funky behaviour once when I had an updated emacs running but outdated precompiled files (.elc or .eln) in my .emacs.d 
[11:06:08] <dirtcastle> yes. i did rm -rf .emacs.d and then ran the init file. i did this multiple times 
[11:06:28] <empwilli> and I got equally funky behaviour as I run emacs as a server and some processes were still around
[11:06:30] <dirtcastle> didn't fix the error
[11:06:43] <dirtcastle> that's just frightening
[11:07:59] <empwilli> then maybe toggle debug-on-error and see from were the function is invoked?
[11:14:42] <dirtcastle> did this already. I'm new to emacs. couldn't fix it. I pasted it here

[11:49:20] <konubinix> dirtcastle: IIRC, you already had this issue last month
[11:49:47] <konubinix> dirtcastle: Did it come back? Or was it never fixed in the first place?
[11:52:48] <konubinix> To me, the stacktrace won't help finding the issue. I think you have part of your org-mode loaded libraries from an old version and part from a newer version
[11:53:07] *** Quits: occ (~occ@user/occ) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[11:53:15] <konubinix> IIUC, org-file-name-concat was created a few month ago
[11:54:30] <konubinix> Then, I assume your version of org-persist.el is recent, while your version of org-compat.el is old
[11:55:40] <konubinix> dirtcastle: I would try to run M-x locate-library org-compat and then M-x locate-library org-persist
[11:55:51] <konubinix> And check whether they are both located in the same place
[11:56:29] <konubinix> I would bet that they are not, org-persist would be where the newest version of org-mode is installed, while org-compat would show where the old version of org-mode is located
[11:56:57] <konubinix> Then, I would try to find out why this old version is there and eventually get rid of it
[11:58:39] <konubinix> If they are in the same directory, I would check whether this directory contains a coherent set of files. May be you came to a situation where your org-mode installation was partially upgraded. But I doubt that, so I would not dig into this possibility before trying the locate-library stuff.
[11:59:35] <konubinix> By the way, I just git cloned org-mode and run a few "git log -S..." to find out a but of context about org-file-name-concat

[19:33:10] <necronian> I ditched ansible and configured my personal vps with org. I got the idea from a blog post I read but I haven't been able to find the post to compare to my solution. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?
[19:33:57] <tyson2> necronian: just curious about your motivation for doing that
[19:36:41] <necronian> tyson2: Setting up a server by hand isn't too hard. But I want to be able to recreate it from scratch again in the future if there are problems. After weeks of fighting with ansible writing everything in org took a couple days.
[19:39:26] <necronian> https://gitlab.com/necronian/vpsconfiguration/ Hopefully there aren't any security credentials in there, I haven't really 100% reviewed it yet.

[19:46:17] <tyson2> necronian: makes sense.  I am hoping to use docker to set up sbcl in wsl, will look at that today
[19:46:50] <tyson2> I prefer to use emacs in windows, will connect to sbcl in docker using tramp
[19:48:29] <tyson2> for deployment, I will eventually try out lightsail which has built-in docker support (not for production, just for proof of concept)
[19:52:06] <necronian> I'm unfairly biased against docker. Years ago I installed it on a dedicated server and it changed network settings *automagically* making it the server unreachable and I had to get remote hands to fix it. Haven't messed with it since.
[19:53:09] <tyson2> I also have misgivings about docker, but I think that it's been improved, and that the positives outweigh the negatives.  We'll see, this is my second try at it
[19:54:04] *** Joins: ngz (~ngz@user/ngz)
[19:54:19] <tyson2> if it fails, then I will just regard the ubuntu distro within wsl as the container itself, and rebuild it if something goes wrong
[19:55:10] <tyson2> but versioning of docker images seems pretty easy, and it should allow for easy deployment onto lightsail (and eventually AWS)

[20:25:59] <necronian> Cymew: Well I was exaggerating a slight bit. But I don't need most of the features ansible has and setting up LDAP for example was annoying. Having to deal with yaml and ldif syntax along with ansible quirks at the same time. meh
[20:26:51] <necronian> I'm not deploying some servers, just basically toys for me and a few friends.
[20:35:34] <Cymew> Well, as I teach ansible I guess I was wondering how org could even compete, but you use whatever works for you, and you know best, I guess. Personally I'd use ansible any day for configuration tasks.
[20:36:10] <Cymew> Setting up LDAP and working with ldif can ruin anyone's day.
