[06:22:01] <murthy> "Road not taken" by Robert Frost
[06:22:12] <Panther> Oh, Ja... I know that one.
[06:22:50] * Panther smiles
[06:23:10] <murthy> The hiking trip and the different trail you took, reminded me of that poem
[06:23:15] <Panther> :)
[06:23:35] <Panther> Other ppl are going up there this Sat.
[06:23:47] <Panther> I wonder if I can get up on the trail this time.
[06:24:11] <murthy> Oh ok. Have you recovered from the hiking fatigue
[06:24:33] <nativetexan> fatigue?
[06:24:49] <Panther> Sure.. I went to the glimbing place and got certified to belay on Tues, and then today I went to PT and finished off the workout here. :)
[06:24:53] <murthy> Panther was like too tired from hiking
[06:24:56] <Panther> climbing

[06:25:11] <nativetexan> belay? what is that?
[06:25:33] <Panther> It is a device that allows you to control the amount of slack in the climber's rope.
[06:25:36] <murthy> afaik people avoid rock faces
[06:25:45] <nativetexan> ah, ok
[06:26:03] <Panther> So, if they fall, they won't fall far, and it also has a locking mechanism so if you hold it down, the rope can't move.
[06:26:26] <Panther> It gets bolted to a harness you wear :)
[06:26:33] <nativetexan> yeah, i've repelled a few times
[06:26:58] <Panther> Then, there are also these anchors on the floor you can bolt to, so you can belay ppl who weigh several times your weight.
[06:27:23] <murthy> Nice
[06:28:30] <Panther> I just started a creatine loading.
[06:28:52] <Panther> With lots of water... now that I have PT 2x/week, and climbing too.
[06:29:17] <murthy> Creatinine?

[06:29:54] <murthy> Oh ya
[06:30:15] <Panther> The only one other than protein powder that actually works, and isn't full of gimmicks.
[06:30:34] <nativetexan> is that vitamin C or vitamin K?
[06:30:50] <Panther> It's not a vitamin.
[06:31:08] <Panther> Creatine is an amino acid located mostly in your body's muscles as well as in the brain.
[06:31:13] <nativetexan> oh, protein powder
[06:31:52] <Panther> Yep... I have a few kinds, but I really only like 2.. they keep becoming unavailable.
[06:32:09] <murthy> I am recovering very nicely

[06:33:27] <nativetexan> brb, got run into the bushes
[06:33:33] <Panther> I had too much aemia for a while.
[06:33:53] <murthy> After the accident?
[06:34:18] <Panther> Nope.. earlier this year.. I always have high hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.
[06:34:39] <Panther> They were a few points over the reference range.
[06:35:15] <murthy> Anemia is lack of RBC :)
[06:35:31] <nativetexan> gotta have those rbc's
[06:35:36] <murthy> Yes
[06:36:22] <murthy> Daily two times non veg food and falooda and ice creams at night
[06:36:46] <nativetexan> mmm...falooda, i think i saw some at HEB
[06:36:56] <murthy> It seems non veg and sugar are the secret to weight gain
[06:37:03] <murthy> :)
[06:37:28] <Panther> High-output cardiac failure is a less common form of heart failure, and although it may sound contradictory at first, in the simplest form, it is still the heart's inability to provide sufficient blood for the body's demand. Most patients with heart failure are either classified as a systolic or diastolic dysfunction with increased systemic vascular resistance, however, patients with high 
[06:37:28] <Panther> output cardiac failure have normal cardiac function and decreased systemic vascular resistance, either secondary to diffuse arteriolar dilation or possible bypass of the arterioles and capillary beds, leading to activation of neurohormones. 
[06:38:02] <murthy> I need to meet some deadlines in work, so not able to have free time
[06:38:10] <Panther> Or by having blood that is too viscous, like if your hematocrit is chronically too high.
[06:38:24] <nativetexan> ok murthy, knock it out
[06:38:52] <nativetexan> make dat money
[06:38:59] <murthy> nativetexan: ya:)

[19:44:19] <Panther> Just not too often.
[19:44:30] <murthy> Why the fsck people are using the caret symbol
[19:44:45] <Panther> Maybe the code was written by rabbits.
[19:44:50] <murthy> "Title:" would be elegant
[19:45:16] <louipc> its pointing upward
[19:45:18] <Panther> I think that is supposed to be like an arrow pointing up to the person who sent the request to the bot.

[19:54:21] <Panther> Plus, youtube 'charges' units to use them.
[19:54:29] <louipc> better than scraping the website i guess
[19:54:52] <louipc> usually change of api is minimal
[19:55:15] <murthy> louipc: ah that one is my Quassel irc server, I just get those links from its database, no separate bot

[21:59:28] <TomatoSynth> where do you live that they're allowed to do that, goddamn
[21:59:30] <artao> but the pre-inspection is SUPPOSED to just be about the condition of the apartment

[21:59:57] <artao> the feds are inspecting the landlord

[22:05:32] <artao> my sleeping bag is rated to like -20F (-28.8C)

[22:11:28] <artao> 13 bucks for 18 beers
[22:12:10] <artao> about 72 cents per 12 fl.oz. can
[22:13:53] <artao> I think the deep maintenance on my box fan has given it at least a couple more years of life. Stripped the motor all the way down and cleaned the electrical connections and relubed the bearings with white lithium grease. BOY were they .... resistent to movement.

[23:24:17] <artao> NOOOOOOO
[23:24:23] <artao> i actually have had no corn this year
[23:24:24] <morf> corn
[23:24:29] <artao> well ..... aside from corn meal
[23:24:30] <morf> that's lame
[23:25:06] <artao> yeah
[23:25:17] <morf> It is a common staple food
[23:25:18] <artao> when corn is available it's often too hot to be boiling water
[23:25:21] <morf> rofl
[23:25:28] <artao> well, i use corn meal
[23:25:41] <artao> *hot and humid
[23:25:56] <artao> and i don't really like to buy imported cuorn cuz it really shouldn't be a thing
[23:26:01] <artao> not good for the environment
[23:26:06] <artao> but whatyever
[23:26:06] <louipc> artao: u sound deprived
[23:26:12] <morf> it's like this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornmeal with hot water or something?
[23:26:13] <Janet> ^ Cornmeal is a meal ground from dried corn. It is a common staple food, and is ground to coarse, medium, and fine consistencies, but not as fine as wheat flour can be.
[23:26:15] <morf> i don't get it
[23:26:17] <artao> s/i/a/
[23:26:17] <Janet> artao thinks morf meant to say: a don't get it
[23:26:24] <artao> too fast
[23:26:29] <morf> :P
[23:26:31] <artao> s/deprived/depraved/
[23:26:31] <Janet> artao thinks louipc meant to say: artao: u sound depraved
[23:26:37] <artao> there we go
[23:26:43] <morf> oh i think i get it
[23:26:44] <louipc> thats not how u doit
[23:26:44] <morf> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polenta
[23:26:45] <Janet> ^ Polenta is a dish of boiled cornmeal that was historically made from other grains. It may be served as a hot porridge, or it may be allowed to cool and solidify into a loaf that can be baked, fried, or grilled.
[23:26:48] <louipc> lemme teach u son
[23:26:56] <louipc> u sound deprived
[23:27:00] <louipc> s/i/a/
[23:27:00] <Janet> louipc meant to say: u sound depraved
[23:27:04] <artao> yeah. i'd call the corn meal i can get me. ground
[23:27:16] <louipc> artao: see
[23:27:19] <artao> i'd not call it a "staple" but i try to keep it in stock
[23:27:28] <artao> GREAT for breading fish
[23:27:49] <artao> and i do quite love it just cooked up as corn meal mush. a bit of butter and honey and/or raw can sugar
[23:27:50] <artao> mmmmmm
[23:27:53] <artao> comfort food
[23:28:01] <louipc> artao: now go to the shop immediately and hitup that nice ass
[23:28:13] <artao> like polenta basically, but polenta is generally coarse ground
[23:28:20] <artao> louipc LOL if only
[23:28:37] <artao> i'd like to be that sort of person, but just ...... amn't
[23:28:40] <artao> i dunno
