[00:10:13] <Bco1981> hi Berlin36, not much. just waiting for the kids to fall asleep. so i can get to bed.
[00:10:20] <JesseDesu> things can escalate
[00:10:28] <Berlin36> i see
[00:10:38] <MootPoot> does it even matter
[00:10:41] <Fenderbassist> they can, but remember both sides want to win
[00:10:43] <MootPoot> like, you cant do anything about it
[00:10:51] <Berlin36> things can escalate indeed, JesseDesu 
[00:10:52] <MootPoot> so just chill and do whatever the fuck you were already doing
[00:11:05] <Berlin36> MootPoot: bad way of thinking >:(
[00:11:07] <MootPoot> its like worrying about when you're gonna die
[00:11:12] <Fenderbassist> so in the end most likely land will be grabbed, arguments had and eventually impositions placed for a while
[00:11:24] <JesseDesu> no one ever knows how wars play out, all of a sudden you find yourself in a world war
[00:11:31] <Fenderbassist> just sucks that it's happening
[00:11:31] <MootPoot> Berlin36: I'd say your way is a bad way of thinking - worrying and wasting your time for something you can't change
[00:11:35] <Fenderbassist> true

[08:25:09] <pokhu> and in the cross rotating
[08:25:18] <amigojapan> oh
[08:25:37] <amigojapan> you can go out of programming to th4e main menu, and see it in object editor I think
[08:25:49] <amigojapan> by opening hte objects
[08:25:54] <pokhu> oh wow
[08:26:15] <pokhu> its really easy to use

[08:46:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There are some projects which attain their goals and don't extend it further. And on a more restricted basis, that applies better to libraries.

[08:47:15] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I could think of a few improvements I would add
[08:47:44] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: and i dont have the energy, but Iwould like ot remake it so it is not based on unity, cuase that is proprietery

[11:03:49] <Nanobot> The situation isn't looking good for Ukraine. Despite Russia's early incompetence, they just keep throwing soldiers at the problem, and it's pretty clear Ukraine has lost all their momentum. The Russians are sieging the major cities, preventing military supplies from coming in. If no other countries join the war, Ukraine's only hope is that the economic pressure becomes too much for Putin (or for enough people below him that it causes a revolution).

[13:09:16] <Duns_Scrotus__>  Unlikely
[13:11:58] *** Joins: pokhu (~rishi@103.206.114.119)
[13:19:47] <KatrinValerie> Duns_Scrotus__: actually, quite a few people believed that and warned about it for many years. my late grandma called it before putin ever invaded gorgia or crimera
[13:20:42] <KatrinValerie> But mostly the eastern european countries and former soviet republics have called this for years
[13:21:51] <KatrinValerie> Nobody can know what happens next I think, we will see how things unfold, I have a feeling that the *west* is trying to break putins support at home.
[13:22:34] <KatrinValerie> I wonder if that will work though, considering how throughoutly russian state media dominates the narrative in russia.
[13:23:14] <KatrinValerie> If regular people tried to stage a coup, things could get even uglier.
[13:23:35] <KatrinValerie> Let's all hope that nobody in this conflict will use nukes
[13:23:52] <Cryowolf> I honestly thought that Putin would be playing a more subtle game for a long time yet. He's cold and calculating and certainly a dictator and a dangerous man for the western world, but I didn't think he'd be so blatant and so sudden. Maybe he felt cornered by NATO and the US pushing closer to Russia's borders, maybe it was also economical with Ukraine having massive gas deposits which could be used to sell electricity to Europe. Making 
[13:23:52] <Cryowolf> Russia lose that pseudo-monopoly. Maybe it's also about taking back some of the USSR territories. Maybe it's also about taking the allegged "pro-russia" territories in Ukraine
[13:24:10] <Cryowolf> so it took me by surprise he would do this so soon. I was certain he would one day
[13:24:13] <Cryowolf> but not now
[13:24:39] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: There is probably something going on that is pressing him to act.
[13:24:53] <KatrinValerie> People speculate it's his health and his massive ego
[13:24:53] <Cryowolf> Russian state media doesn't really work for younger generations that have social media and can get their information more globally
[13:25:22] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: the issue is the massive state violence, that is commited by people who are mostly brainwashed.
[13:25:24] <Cryowolf> he has a massive ego but so do most leaders of countries and his ego has never made him act like that on it before. He's always been calculating
[13:26:03] <KatrinValerie> He miscalculated, I think he assumed that ukraine would forfeit in the face of russian arsenal
[13:26:04] <Cryowolf> I get the feeling most Russians don't want to invade Ukraine though, they don't want to kill Ukrainians and they don't like being there. But they have to, for mother Russia and all that
[13:26:21] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: they are being fed lies about concentration camps in ukraine
[13:26:32] <Cryowolf> yep, instead he now has so many sanctions against Russia that the value of their currency has dropped immensly
[13:26:53] <KatrinValerie> The soliders themselves believe that they are on a mission 'to free their brothers and sisters in ukraine'
[13:27:18] <Cryowolf> they're noticing that's not true really fast though, like the moment they enter and everyone tells them to leave
[13:27:28] <Cryowolf> when the ordinary citizen is armed against them
[13:27:40] <KatrinValerie> That also explains why moral is low, besides poor management of the war, their spearheads have not secured support lines
[13:28:29] <Cryowolf> their tanks also lose gas or break down in the middle of the roads
[13:28:34] <Cryowolf> and people tow them away
[13:28:43] <KatrinValerie> Unless russia intents to starve/bomb all major cities they won't be able to capture them either and ukraine can rely on partisan warfare
[13:28:50] <KatrinValerie> Similar to vietkong tactics
[13:28:52] <Cryowolf> obviously a lot of the stuff coming out of Ukraine is also propaganda
[13:29:11] <Cryowolf> but I'm on the side of Ukraine here
[13:29:24] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: you can at least try to look for verifyable accounts from normal ukrainian people
[13:29:26] <Cryowolf> they're being invaded, Putin is the aggressor and the enemy here
[13:29:29] <Sapphirus> U.S. media is a full-on propaganda machine
[13:29:45] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, I know. Why are you telling us this?
[13:29:47] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: Propaganda accounts hardly put much effort to hide the fact that they are such
[13:30:02] <Sapphirus> Crywolf, I'm just affirming what you said.
[13:30:10] <Cryowolf> okay
[13:30:27] <KatrinValerie> Well, the first thing that dies with war is truth
[13:30:43] <Cryowolf> Russia broke a tabooo in the EU, not to send weapons etc to a country at war
[13:30:49] <Cryowolf> now we're all doing that here
[13:30:58] <KatrinValerie> Someone once said that and now they are dead, so we better listen to them or something
[13:31:17] <Cryowolf> we even have people going to join Ukraines newly formed "Foreign Defense Unit" or whatever it's called
[13:31:23] <KatrinValerie> Rough times are ahead
[13:31:52] <Cryowolf> the moment Putin threatened Sweden, the entire idea of "let's not send weapons" changed to "send weapons"
[13:31:59] <name300> amigojapan: hi
[13:32:08] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: what's your opinion on rumors that sweden might feel so provoked that they at some point join the armed fights with their military?
[13:32:34] <Duns_Scrotus__> KatrinValerie: I mean the people in I spoke to in Kyiv were just starting to think it might be possible, previously everyone was denying it
[13:32:38] <Cryowolf> we barely have a military. I can see us getting a massively increased military budget now though
[13:32:45] <Sapphirus> As an EU country. they'd start WW3 essentially
[13:32:52] <Cryowolf> and bolstering our military and so on
[13:32:57] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, who would?
[13:33:04] <Sapphirus> Sweden if they joined in.
[13:33:07] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: common, don't downtalk stuff, Eurofighters are hard to maintain
[13:33:44] <Cryowolf> KatrinValerie, I'm not downtalking. I'm saying we can barely muster a defense force. So we wouldn't send ours to fight when there's a danger we could be attacked
[13:33:45] <Sapphirus> I think any one western country joining in would just escalate it beyond anything we've seen since WWII.

[13:34:13] <KatrinValerie> They also have more counter vectors, their electronics are more sensitive etc

[13:35:34] <Cryowolf> I think this will results in the EU either creating a coalition military force or a military of its own
[13:35:41] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: I hear there's also Nato drones
[13:35:43] <Cryowolf> because Russia is forcing our hand
[13:36:01] <Cryowolf> Nato won't get involved unless a Nato country is attacked
[13:36:20] <Cryowolf> but the funny thing is if Ukraine attacks an EU country, they'd have to move in and occupy Ukraine
[13:36:24] <Cryowolf> (Nato)
[13:36:26] <Cryowolf> I mean a nato country
[13:36:34] <Cryowolf> and that would mean they'd fight Russia
[13:36:37] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: not quite right, a Nato country joining the conflict would be enough to invoke the article if I am informed correctly
[13:36:50] <Cryowolf> a nato country being attacked is
[13:36:53] <Cryowolf> not attacking
[13:37:16] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: as soon as they join in, there will likely be attacks
[13:37:32] <Cryowolf> yes but I think it means unprovoked
[13:37:37] <Cryowolf> non-retalitory
[13:37:59] <Cryowolf> it would be hard to justify war and an invasion force if you're the aggressor
[13:38:02] <KatrinValerie> It has been a long time since I read that stuff
[13:38:09] <KatrinValerie> I am not sure
[13:38:12] <Cryowolf> even if it's against an aggressor that's not an aggressor against you
[13:38:39] <Cryowolf> having justifications for going to war is important
[13:39:05] <Cryowolf> otherwise you become an untrustworthy pariah that's isolated by the world in its entirety
[13:39:12] <Cryowolf> (like North Korea)
[13:39:31] <Cryowolf> anyway I'm gonna go play some more Dying Light 2
[13:39:35] <Cryowolf> enough war talk
[13:39:50] <Cryowolf> I stand with Ukraine though
[13:40:11] <Sapphirus> Destabilising and isolating a power like that with functional nuclear weaponry would be a strategic mistake imho
[13:40:41] <Sapphirus> Pushing them into a corner with nothing to lose, that's how you get nukes flying.
[13:40:47] <Cryowolf> I disagree. Even Putin knows the moment a single nuclear bomb leaves Russia. That's it
[13:40:55] <Cryowolf> mutual destruction done
[13:40:56] <Sapphirus> He may not even care.

[13:42:33] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: yeah, that's why I am looking into secondary sources, it's swamped with misinfo these days
[13:42:38] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, it's not optismism. It's realism. A coupe is very likely if he gets very serious about firing nuclear bombs without first being in a position where he's threatened enough to do so
[13:42:43] <Cryowolf> Putin isn't stupid
[13:43:17] <Cryowolf> He's flexing Russia's muscles, but he's not gonna fire nuclear bombs over sanctions. He's gonna seek aid with other countries like he has with China
[13:43:30] <Sapphirus> Stupid he may not be, but sane he definitely is not.
[13:43:38] <Cryowolf> oh he's perfectly sane
[13:43:45] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: chinas position on this conflict will have a huge impact on the outcome
[13:43:54] <Cryowolf> he's a cold, calculating psychopath, but he's not deranged or insane
[13:44:00] <Sapphirus> Lol judging by those photos of him sitting several metres down a long table..
[13:44:05] <Sapphirus> Nah, I don't believe that.
[13:44:10] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: Declaring insanity as the cause for violent behaviour is done way too often.
[13:44:25] <KatrinValerie> Insane people are much more likely to be victims than perputrators
[13:44:33] <Cryowolf> China's position will be very determined by the financial impact on them as a country and on their place in the world as an economical powerhouse
[13:44:43] <KatrinValerie> Sane people commit murder/acts of unthinkable violence etc
[13:44:48] <KatrinValerie> That is the thing that people do not get
[13:45:07] <Cryowolf> it's not insane Sapphirus, it's simply a different culture where they represent power differently
[13:45:11] <KatrinValerie> Regular people turn to murder easily when you make them believe it's justified
[13:45:14] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, let's not try to be apologetic towards people who're insane. latter can still be true.
[13:45:35] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: apologetic?
[13:45:51] <KatrinValerie> I am saying, stop spreading the stupid trope of the dangerous insane
[13:45:59] <KatrinValerie> It's harmful
[13:46:04] <Sapphirus> There's a direct correlation between insanity and unregulated behaviour. I don't know where you get this idea that this isn't the case.
[13:46:09] <Duns_Scrotus__> He‚Äôs sane he just has old school nationalist boomer opinions lots of Russians think ukraine belongs to Russia
[13:46:18] <KatrinValerie> And it clouds your view on the situation, as you can then just blame any act on insanity and irrationality
[13:46:26] <Cryowolf> insane means you have irrational behavior
[13:46:33] <Sapphirus> ^
[13:46:36] <Duns_Scrotus__> And he knows he‚Äôs sacrificing his people‚Äôs well-being but he‚Äôs willing to do it
[13:46:41] <Cryowolf> and he's acting rational, from his perspective and position
[13:46:58] <Duns_Scrotus__> Maybe he underestimated the resistance and economic impact
[13:47:02] <Sapphirus> See, that's the key point there -- from his perspective and position.
[13:47:09] <Cryowolf> it's better to understand people, their motivation, why they are doing things and so on than to paint them as insane
[13:47:14] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: that's what psychiatry thinks, but insanity in psychotic people is certainly something else. They are still rational and they do reason, but based on faulty information and processing.
[13:47:45] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, yes but saying he's insane as a blanket statement and reason for his actions is inviting ignorance
[13:47:45] <KatrinValerie> I should say mainstream psychiatry
[13:48:20] <KatrinValerie> There are movements within it that want to give the "insane" a voice and "insane" people are fighting for their rights themselves, which is imho the most important part.
[13:48:22] <Cryowolf> I think he's rational, but I don't think he's reasonable
[13:48:34] <KatrinValerie> Psychiatry as it stands is atrocious
[13:48:46] <Cryowolf> psychiatry evolves, thankfully
[13:48:48] <Sapphirus> Cryowolf, I Understand that, but it is a true statement onto itself if we don't try to rationalise it through his worldview.
[13:49:03] <Cryowolf> we dont even have to rationalize it through his worldview
[13:49:57] <Sapphirus> > <KatrinValerie> There are movements within it that want to give the "insane" a voice and "insane" people are fighting for their rights themselves, which is imho the most important part. < Until their irrational, unregulated behaviour, causes harm to another person or being.
[13:50:17] <Cryowolf> the US has invaded countries across the globe because they felt a little threatened. Russia literally has NATO circling them with missiles and other military arms. Sanctioning them etc. What he's doing isn't that different
[13:50:21] <Cryowolf> It's wrong
[13:50:35] <Cryowolf> but it follows the same set of rationale
[13:56:36] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: You are missing my point and the point of mentally ill people organising.
[13:56:39] <Sapphirus> Having dealt with family members who have mental health issues, I think your view is very warped and flat-out dangerous, KatrinValerie. Normalising a disjointed reality is not a functional approach and it doesn't work long-term.
[13:56:48] <Sapphirus> I say this from experience.
[13:56:57] <KatrinValerie> You already are misrepresenting my position
[13:57:19] <Sapphirus> When you put "insane" in airquotes, I think your position is being represented fairly by me.
[13:57:26] <KatrinValerie> This is about respecting the mentally ill as people, obviusly a person needs support during a psychotic break 
[13:57:47] <Sapphirus> There's a difference between that and normalising delusions or an otherwise disjointed reality of someone mentally unwell.
[13:57:53] <KatrinValerie> But we have to do our best to make involuntary mesures not needed
[13:59:17] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: these patients just want to have a say in their own treatment, they just ask that doctors put their reports of side effects into consideration. Psychiatry is destroying the health of many people with psychotic disorders, because of poor medication management.
[13:59:30] <KatrinValerie> When you ignore reports of side effects this becomes life threatening
[13:59:42] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: they are simply fighting for basic human rights
[14:00:03] <Sapphirus> Side effects are probably better than being locked up because your mental health is too unstable to live alongside other people.
[14:00:11] <KatrinValerie> Nobody wants you to confirm their delusions or whatever you are thinking my position is.
[14:00:13] <Sapphirus> You can't have it both ways.
[14:00:30] <KatrinValerie> What do you know about psychotic disorders and research on them?
[14:00:48] <KatrinValerie> What do you know about treatment plans?
[14:01:07] <Sapphirus> Quite a lot, given I've dealt with this stuff first hand with family.
[14:01:09] <KatrinValerie> If you are not well informed on this topic, do not pretend you know what is best for those people.
[14:01:22] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: that doesn't automatically make you impartial on the matter.
[14:01:40] <name300> so um KatrinValerie is that so
[14:01:47] <KatrinValerie> You have a very subjective view on the situation Sapphirus 
[14:01:56] <KatrinValerie> You cannot generalise from your situation
[14:02:18] <KatrinValerie> Or rather the situation of your relative
[14:02:20] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, not really. I've dealt with this first hand and you simply cannot just have your cake and eat it.
[14:02:39] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: You are still arguing a strawman
[14:02:43] <Sapphirus> In a lot of circumstances, there's no way to avoid medication as a treatment.
[14:02:50] <KatrinValerie> I never said that FFS
[14:03:27] <Sapphirus> And when they voluntarily quit the medication, they end up in the pscyh ward after a mental breakdown. I've seen it with my won eyes to know what you're advocating for is absolute nonsense.
[14:03:35] <KatrinValerie> And I know that myself
[14:03:49] <KatrinValerie> Because you can't just stop these meds

[14:04:09] <Sapphirus> It's not the medications fault.
[14:04:24] <KatrinValerie> Tapering and finding something that is better tolerated is an approach that has been shown to prevent hospitalisation
[14:04:34] <dfch> oh wait it still weissbier lel
[14:04:34] <Sapphirus> Reality is that people with mental illness get this idea that they don't need the medication anymore for whatever reason and quit it.
[14:04:39] <Sapphirus> It's a very cyclic thing 
[14:04:50] <KatrinValerie> That's a generalisation
[14:05:07] <KatrinValerie> And a situation they end up in because of maltreatment most of the time
[14:05:40] <KatrinValerie> If they tolerate the medicine well they will often understand themselves that it helps

[14:05:54] <KatrinValerie> I am bipolar and I have no intent of just stopping my fucking meds
[14:06:37] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: if you catch things early enough, these ilnesses are manageable
[14:06:39] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, and I've seen it happen with members of my own family. You can say that but my real-world experience tells the opposite story.
[14:06:59] <KatrinValerie> I also have family members with psychotic disorders and I have experienced them psychotic
[14:07:05] <KatrinValerie> had to manage their situation and everything
[14:07:55] <KatrinValerie> Now I myself also have had psychotic breaks, but that does not mean I am always completely unreasonable or that I cannot take care of my life and myself.

[14:08:56] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: so long as I put nobody in danger, any forced mesures are completely unjustified and in violation of human rights.
[14:08:56] <Sapphirus> People with psychiatric problems will end up deciding to quit their medication on whim. Not all of them do, but it does happen a lot.
[14:09:20] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: You say they do it on a whim, but you have no idea about the side effects.
[14:09:25] <Sapphirus> As much as you say it's maltreatment, well, I'm not so sure it isn't anything but whim.
[14:09:32] <KatrinValerie> A medication that worked for years can suddenly become a problem itself
[14:09:55] <KatrinValerie> It happened for me with Quetiapin, I can no longer take it, as it makes me paranoid and triggers psychotic episodes
[14:10:13] <Sapphirus> That's unfortunate, but some people will also do it because they think they don't need it anymore.
[14:10:32] <KatrinValerie> And I have seen other patients in the ward, who were put on it and got more psychotic 
[14:10:39] <KatrinValerie> and the more they raised the dosage the worse it got
[14:10:42] <KatrinValerie> That's malpractise
[14:10:56] <KatrinValerie> But that is what happens when you do not listen to the insane and discount everything they say
[14:11:39] <KatrinValerie> You end up with the people who are supposed to care for us in our most vurnerable moments who then mistreat us because of all the dehumanizing/degrading talk about psychotic illness.
[14:12:17] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: Lots of doctors believe movement disorders to be part of psychotic disorders, because they have never seen a psychotic patient without extra pyramidal issues.
[14:12:22] <KatrinValerie> It is fucking nasty

[14:16:06] <name300> amigojapan: friend
[14:16:30] <Sapphirus> And I think that treatment should be voluntary, unless involuntary treatment is of necessity.

[14:16:53] <KatrinValerie> I never said anything about declaring vocabulary as hot lava
[14:17:06] <KatrinValerie> I said think about how you use words, that is absolutely not the same
[14:17:30] <KatrinValerie> And first and foremost, I said that you should not blame warcrimes on the mental state of a ruler
[14:17:40] <KatrinValerie> Because there is absolutely no benefit to doing that
[14:18:21] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: blaming mental health for atrocious acts is what I argue against
[14:18:46] <KatrinValerie> Because that is never the full picture of any situation
[14:18:55] <Sapphirus> Well, it's the same thing to me, because who are you to dictate how I use vocabulary? Furthermore, you seem to want to advocate for a disconnection between one's mental state and their behaviour as if none of them have anything to do with one another.
[14:18:59] <KatrinValerie> gosh now I am engaging myself
[14:19:01] <Sapphirus> Which couldn't be farther from the truth in my estimation.

[14:22:36] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, the problem is with how you phrase "insane" as if insanity isn't real.
[14:22:55] <Sapphirus> Then try to disconnect one's mental state from their actions and behaviours.
[14:22:59] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: uh it's an abstract concept
[14:23:00] <Sapphirus> That's what is so dangerous about your position. 
[14:23:13] <KatrinValerie> You do not get it right
[14:23:33] <Sapphirus> I'm not underestimating it. To me, anyway, it's the clearest example of how you conceptualise this issue.
[14:23:42] <KatrinValerie> People who suffer from psychotic illness, can have moments of clarity, but they can also communicate some of their needs when they are psychotic
[14:24:11] <KatrinValerie> They are just asking not to have their voices completely discounted as soon as they had a break
[14:24:38] <KatrinValerie> It's not about normalising mental illness, I honestly do not even fully understand what that is supposed to mean
[14:24:59] <KatrinValerie> But if it means making it normal to speak about mental health issues and allow people who experienced it to speak on the matters
[14:25:03] <Sapphirus> Normalising a disjointed reality of someone who is mentally ill is what I was talking about.
[14:25:21] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: And I do not advocate for that at all, I do not know anyone who would.
[14:25:43] <KatrinValerie> But I have seen the anti-woke brigade claiming that activists support this position that you are describing.
[14:26:05] <KatrinValerie> Which is an absurd strawman argument, that was constructed to silence those that speak up against the status quo

[14:27:26] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: there is massive evidence that things like CBT can be used to help people manage their psychotic disorders for example, but hardly anyone ever treats people with these
[14:27:36] <Sapphirus> KatrinValerie, it really isn't, though, is it? You are trying to form a disconnect between mental illness and behaviours typically associated thereof.
[14:27:50] <KatrinValerie> If you had psychosis, it is really hard to find therapy, but you might need therapy because your psychosis was traumatic.

[15:22:48] <isekaijin> haha
[15:22:59] <isekaijin> ‚ÄúConversation‚Äù is just a name for an email thread.
[15:23:12] <isekaijin> In your case, the thread contains just one email, though.
[15:23:17] <darkwitch> an unfortunate name
[15:23:34] <isekaijin> Sure. I'm not approving of it.
[15:23:59] <isekaijin> ‚ÄúThread‚Äù is a more accurate name.
[15:25:07] <darkwitch> one mail is not a thread
[15:26:26] <isekaijin> Ah, that's a distinction between programmer-speak and how normal people talk.
[15:26:38] <MikeEcho> sup smeggie?
[15:26:45] <isekaijin> Programmers are used to talking about collections with just one or even zero elements.
[15:27:13] <isekaijin> For a normal person, a collection has to have at least two elements.
[15:27:18] <darkwitch> zero emails is a thread too?

[15:28:13] <isekaijin> It's probably not possible to see a zero-email thread as a user, but I wouldn't be surprised if, internally, when a thread is created, it starts empty, and only then emails are added.
[15:28:19] <darkwitch> maybe it's like a store that sells empty spools with no thread on them
[15:31:16] <isekaijin> There are good reasons for talking about zero or one-element collections in programming, though. For example, suppose you want to write a routine that ‚Äúdownloads every email in a thread‚Äù.

[16:43:44] <MootPoot> and figure it out
[16:43:46] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh. You don't download the g-code that's meant to be run for other printers and use it on your own. You get the model file like the .stl file and generate the printer-specificv gcode using a slicer software like Cura, and run the g-code that you generated.
[16:43:55] <MootPoot> Sadale: that's what I do
[16:44:03] <MootPoot> what I mean is that the gcode that cura makes dosen't work

[18:11:23] <JesseDesu> my sennheisers ear pads have finally ripped beyond repair
[18:12:15] <Poeticode> hmmm DT 770 Pro, 80 ohm. Tho I kinda wish I went with a pair that bumps up bass/treble
[18:12:36] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[18:12:47] * MootPoot licks Sadale 
[18:12:48] <Poeticode> but they're hella comfy and I can easily wear them during an entire work day
[18:12:54] * Sadale licks MootPoot back :3
[18:13:04] <MootPoot> Poeticode: sennheiser 599SE's for me
[18:13:14] <MootPoot> open back ones are so much nicer to wear for long periods of time

[18:14:01] <JesseDesu> is the cable detachable
[18:14:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol ew
[18:14:21] <MootPoot> if sadale sells enough imouto bathwater he can retire early
[18:14:28] <Poeticode> probably JesseDesu :D but I haven't poked at audiophile stuff in a long time
[18:14:29] <Sadale> MootPoot, I mean I could bottle my own shower water and sell them.
[18:14:38] <MootPoot> hey! that's fraud
[18:14:39] <Sadale> MootPoot, I could even sell my own water claiming that it's from a gamer girl

[18:15:20] <JesseDesu> is that the diameter of the cup
[18:15:41] <MootPoot> Oh Hell Maw
[18:17:14] <Poeticode> higher ohm = better audio, but you might need an amp and it might not work w/ phones and stuff
[18:17:40] <MootPoot> will*
[18:18:00] <MootPoot> high amp headphones basically require an amp

[18:19:41] <MootPoot> 4k javs made me like watching porn again
[18:19:43] <Sadale> MootPoot, what's it about? The content inside the jav
[18:19:47] <MootPoot> since it feels a lot more "real"
[18:19:58] <Sadale> lol I don't even have a screen capable for showing 4k shit
[18:20:03] <MootPoot> since you dont get that feeling that you're watching through a monitor due to the pixelation
[18:20:37] <MootPoot> Sadale: I dont know about this one actually
[18:20:38] <Sadale> I guess I could just zoom in the 4K by 2x and enjoy the full pixel experience :3
[18:20:50] <MootPoot> in honesty I downloaded like 20 of them
[18:20:52] <Sadale> 45GB is a lot. How long is the vid?
[18:20:56] <MootPoot> about 20-300gb overall
[18:20:58] <MootPoot> 200*

[22:19:10] <Satin> 3
[22:19:11] <MootPoot> I get takeout or delivery maybe once a month
[22:19:11] <Satin> idk
[22:19:16] <MootPoot> I feel like I'm turning into emmeka 
[22:19:30] <emmeka> >gets takeout or delivery
[22:19:32] <Satin> she was drunk and drove right into my parked car
[22:19:33] <Satin> at 1 am
[22:19:35] <emmeka> doesn't sound like emmeka
[22:19:44] <Satin> and so my poor baby is ruined
[22:19:49] <MootPoot> emmeka: I meant the turning into a home-cook-only party
[22:19:51] <MootPoot> part*
[22:20:03] <emmeka> well, you should, there's no reason not to.
[22:20:12] <MootPoot> seems like according to microsoft weather or whatever - there will be no snow in May
[22:20:13] <emmeka> eating out is for travelling
[22:20:19] <MootPoot> so there's your spring Satin 
[22:20:23] <MootPoot> wait another month
[22:20:30] <MootPoot> 2 months*
[22:20:34] <emmeka> yeah, average last frost here is 3rd week of May.
[22:21:03] <emmeka> snow usually melting over the course of April, and by early May things are clear enough, though perhaps too wet, for field work

[22:23:38] <emmeka> MootPoot you didn't apply to EI already?
[22:23:55] <emmeka> you realize you have to wait for it right. for like, a month.
[22:24:12] <MootPoot> I was about to do it , but I had like 3-4 interviews at the time
[22:24:17] <MootPoot> I thought I could make it 
[22:24:20] <MootPoot> without
[22:24:30] <emmeka> but why not do it anyway, EI is retroactive.
[22:24:39] <MootPoot> I have enough cash for another month or 1.5 months so I'm good there
[22:24:56] <MootPoot> but its just...I thought I was in demand enough that I would be employed by now
[22:25:08] <emmeka> you'd still get EI for the intervening weeks even if by the time your application was processed you're employed again
[22:25:26] <MootPoot> isen't there a limit between how often you can ask for EI?
[22:25:40] <MootPoot> say I get a job and then they  yeet me after 2 weeks
[22:25:41] <emmeka> there's a minimum number of hours required.
[22:25:55] <emmeka> but, if you still had hours on a previous claim, you can reinitialize it
[22:26:07] <MootPoot> hmm
[22:26:39] <MootPoot> shit then
[22:26:43] <MootPoot> guess I'll apply today
[22:26:45] <emmeka> so say you get approved for like 40 weeks EI, then you are on it for a month and then get a job, which then lays you off in 2 weeks. You just go back on the old claim, you had weeks left.
[22:27:10] <MootPoot> I was still debating between keeping trying to get a job, or applying for a masters program
[22:27:35] <Bco1981> when does the masters program start ?
[22:27:47] <MootPoot> application deadline is in ~15 days
[22:27:56] <MootPoot> I think it starts in a few months
[22:28:31] <Bco1981> oh, 15 days...
[22:28:40] <emmeka> MootPoot the only minimum waiting period for EI is 7 days straight since your last day of earned income. *Always* apply to EI right away *unless* you are reasonably certain you will be employed (as in, actually starting a day of work) within a single week. And if not that, *always* apply once 7 days have passed.
[22:28:52] <emmeka> there is no downside.

[22:29:36] <MootPoot> application is in 15, then IF they say yet, then I guess its the next term after this one
[22:29:50] <MootPoot> so may/june I think
[22:30:16] <Bco1981> and if you sign up, you can't get out of it ?
[22:30:56] <emmeka> MootPoot in fact there's actually a maximum amount of time you have to apply for EI, iirc it's something like a month or two.
[22:31:04] <MootPoot> woa
[22:31:05] <MootPoot> wha
[22:31:06] <emmeka> you can't just put it off and do it later

[22:32:14] <MootPoot> its been 29 days since I stopped working 
[22:32:49] <MootPoot> lol I lke how there's explicitly a "fishing benefits"
[22:33:16] <emmeka> why is that lol
[22:33:33] <emmeka> fishermen get special benefits because they can claim EI during their entire off-season without question
[22:33:45] <emmeka> there's no requirement to find other employment
[22:33:52] <MootPoot> not for famers during winter?
[22:34:00] <emmeka> nope.
[22:34:10] <emmeka> but farmers also generally don't pay into EI.
[22:34:58] <emmeka> MootPoot this is like how the entirety of the population in Newfie villages live. Fish all summer... pogey and rum all winter...
[22:35:42] <emmeka> MootPoot anyway if it's been 29 days apply immediately, as in, right fucking now during business hours, because you're already late...
[22:35:55] <Nanobot> Someone just made an excellent point in a Japanese comment of a Hololive clip: If tea is leaf juice, then coffee is nut juice.

[23:17:02] <Nanobot> In Russia, they're moving to make it a felony to say anything about the war that doesn't align with the government's propaganda. For example, it will be a felony to call it a war.

[23:23:15] <Nanobot> The nuclear threat is precisely why the U.S. and Europe have avoided directly participating in the fight, and have instead focused on the Russian economy. They're hoping everyone below Putin feels enough pain that they'll be less likely to follow Putin's orders and more ready to overthrow him if he tries to go nuclear.
