[03:35:05] <Tangent-Man> Does anyone know where there is a good tutourial on partitioning disks on a UEFI system. I would like to setup encryption.. it is not dual boot.. I don't want everything just on want partion I would like seperate /home /root and /swap.. ?
[03:35:34] <Tangent-Man> I am trying to install Bullseye lolz
[03:35:54] <mannequin> you just make a single luks container
[03:36:08] <mannequin> the containers for your partition in that luks virtual device
[03:36:12] <mannequin> and that's it
[03:36:24] <mannequin> not rocket science
[03:36:35] <mannequin> efi and /boot have to be unencrypted
[03:37:20] <Tangent-Man> Can't grub 2 unencrypt /boot on a EFI system?
[03:37:59] <amacater_> OK - I'd start with an expert install: unless you REALLY REALLY need to, just use the encrypted LVM option and a single partition - it will make your life so much easier.
[03:38:22] *** Joins: Enissay (~Enissay@user/enissay)
[03:38:43] <pasiz> Tangent-Man: boot/efi needs to be decrypted, hard to load encrypted grub
[03:38:44] <amacater_> If not, use encrypted LVM and then mess around with it.
[03:39:27] <amacater_> Essentially, there is a boot/efi partition which has grub and then drops you to a prompt for the LUKS key.
[03:39:43] <amacater_> It's (almost) foolproof

[03:40:24] <pasiz> exactly. but there are other caveats when boot is encrypted
[03:40:33] * amacater_ has two machines here like that and should really do something similar and reformat the rubbish laptop :)
[03:41:16] <Tangent-Man> Its my first time with UEFI lolz I am a UEFI noob
[03:41:43] <Tangent-Man> amacater_,  Did you mean to say you wouldn't start with an expert install?
[03:41:52] <Tangent-Man> ^^
[03:41:52] <amacater_> It's really easy - set the firmware to boot UEFI rather than Legacy/MBR
[03:42:44] <amacater_> Tangent-Man: If you want to see what's happening _and_ mess with partitioning, I'd start with an expert install, yes. I'd also recommend using the unofficial non-free iso which includes firmware
[03:42:55] <amacater_> It makes life so much easier if you want to use wifi
[03:43:12] <amacater_> Essentially: the Debian iso can be written to a USB stick.
[03:43:38] <amacater_> If the laptop is set to boot UEFI, it will boot UEFI. If legacy, it will boot and partition for legacy.
[03:44:26] <amacater_> If you've nothing important on the disk, I'd be tempted to use something like a gparted iso to wipe the disk completely before starting and remove any partitions that are already there.
[03:45:14] <amacater_> I do _lots_ of installs when it comes to testing the CD media with each point release.
[03:45:37] <Tangent-Man> I see.
[03:46:11] <amacater_> Be prepared to make a mistake, reboot and rerun the installer a couple of times if you're not sure. Stuff is written to disk fairly late in the process.
[03:46:28] <Tangent-Man> Perhaps I should get the non-free .iso
[03:46:45] <amacater_> if you're prepared to just do it the straightforward way, take guided partitioning and encrypted LVM
[03:47:05] *** Quits: alex_ (~alex11@user/alex11) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:48:13] <Tangent-Man> I think the problem was I didn't set up a seperate /boot partition. At the end of the installer it didn't even ask me to install grub.. then when I rebooted it just chucks me to a grub prompt.. I guess it can't find the kernal etc. in the /boot partition
[03:49:45] <amacater_> Tangent-Man: Get the non-free .iso, yes - it makes life simpler :)

[03:56:28] <amacater_> At which point, if it's only ever had Windows 10 installed with UEFI - just let the partitioner overwrite the whole damn thing - if you use the expert install, you get to see what's on the disk already - delete every partition so you have empty space and then use guided partitioning and encrypted LVM

[14:51:07] <snowcode1> I think I had something like that before when having a recent kernel version
[14:51:30] <snowcode1> I upgraded because I wanted to patch the vulernability with root privilege elevation

[14:53:42] <shtrb> I was joking , there was a recent CVE about a way to get root privleges , and  I assumed it was the reason why you had upgraded in the first place, but now you got yourself in to a worse situation
[14:54:01] <snowcode1> shtrb: Yes exactly lol

[17:50:55] <jelly> Tangent-Man, /boot isn't written to a whole lot at all, only when grub config, a new kernel or initramfs is created or updated.  ext2-ext4 is just fine

[21:26:11] <royaljelly> zsh was doing this https://i.imgur.com/RSvd2lM.png, and i thought that rm would only delete the files in my current directory because of the prompt

[21:28:00] <royaljelly> uh, /usr/sbin/init exists
[21:28:39] <amacater_> Another check is to run rm [whatever] then the -rf so htat you explicitly have to type what you are about to delete. Red Hat and similar alias rm to rm -i - so you can always add the -i flag to make it interactive and ask you to confirm with a y. Great for a couple of files - hell for thousands

[23:20:08] <karlpinc> HelloShitty: All you want to do is supress output?  I'm not sure what commands you are interested in but you might look at "expect".  Or just redirecting to /dev/null.  Or using stty so the terminal does not echo.  Or looking at the vt102 control codes and interacting with the terminal.
