[02:48:16] <shush> When is SPV used? Why isn't SPV used for mobile wallets? Are there issues with SPV?
[02:48:21] *** Joins: cvmn (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[02:49:12] <belcher> the phrase SPV can mean a few slightly different things in bitcoin
[02:49:25] <belcher> it would be accurate to say all lightweight wallets use SPV, so mobile wallets do use SPV
[02:49:27] <shush> SPV wallet*
[02:49:35] <belcher> the SPV described in the whitepaper doesnt work if you're thinking of that
[02:49:58] <belcher> these days it mostly means "use merkle proofs to prove that a transaction really was mined"
[02:50:00] <shush> What is broken about SPV?
[02:50:07] *** Quits: kexkey (~kexkey@static-198-54-132-88.cust.tzulo.com) (Quit: kexkey)
[02:50:17] <belcher> it is equivalent to trusting the miners, also it cant prove that a lie-by-omission didnt happen
[02:50:18] <shush> as described by the whitepaper*
[02:50:31] <shush> lie-by-omission?
[02:50:35] <belcher> as described in the whitepaper the keyword you want is "fraud proofs"
[02:50:50] <belcher> and nobody has figured out a way to make them work, theres always something broken in any scheme
[02:51:25] <belcher> lie-by-omission for example your electrum wallet syncs with an electrum server, you did get paid with a transaction but the server just doesnt tell you about it so you never find out
[02:54:40] *** Joins: scr (scr@user/scr)
[02:56:48] <shush> lie-by-omission is a sort of eclipse attack right? If I connect to many nodes and listen for transactions in the mempool then I can know of some transaction relevant to me.
[02:57:28] <shush> However, if I'm syncing from scratch, I suppose that's another issue, but still all nodes I query from would have to lie-by-omission (eclipse)
[02:58:16] <shush> lie-by-omission would be easy to detect given at least one full node sends me something the other nodes refuse to send
[02:58:24] <shush> belcher: Or am I missing something?
[02:58:35] *** Quits: cvmn (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:58:58] <belcher> shush electrum for example doesnt connect to nodes on the p2p network, it connects to electrum servers
[02:59:11] <belcher> and when i say "electrum wallet" i mean any wallet which uses the electrum protocol, which is many many of them
[02:59:25] <belcher> but yes the concept is similar to an eclipse attack on bitcoin nodes on the p2p network
[02:59:57] <belcher> the thing is blocks use hashes to make sure that no block is missed out, so its impossible to lie-by-omission about just one block, you have to lie about the whole blockchain
[02:59:57] *** Joins: kexkey (~kexkey@static-198-54-132-88.cust.tzulo.com)
[03:00:06] <shush> The problem with electrum is that it's not P2P but instead using a client/server model.
[03:00:08] <belcher> while with something like an electrum server you really can just lie about one address or one transaction
[03:00:44] <shush> I see. So SPV under a client/server model is broken for obvious reasons.
[03:01:25] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[03:01:25] <belcher> any SPV has less security, even if it used the bitcoin p2p network
[03:01:26] *** Quits: bomb-on (~bomb-on@user/bomb-on) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:01:30] <shush> But SPV wallets using the P2P network would probably work
[03:01:50] <shush> belcher: Less security than a full node?
[03:01:53] <belcher> any SPV wallet still 100% trusts the miners, so if miners wanted to they could print infinite bitcoins, or spend coins not belonging to them
[03:01:53] <shush> Sure.
[03:02:50] <shush> belcher: Depends on if the miner network are honest right?
[03:03:03] <shush> If a majority of miners are not honest, then yes this could happen.
[03:03:35] <belcher> what is "honest"?
[03:03:58] *** Quits: scr (scr@user/scr) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[03:04:26] <shush> "free of deceit and untruthfulness; sincere"
[03:04:26] <belcher> we cant assume they'll be honest
[03:04:41] <belcher> if we could assume people will be honest then we dont need bitcoin at all
[03:05:11] <shush> belcher: I see what you're saying, but at some level you make assumptions.
[03:05:38] <belcher> "51% of miners will turn down an offer to print free money" is a bad assumption id say
[03:06:19] <shush> Under what context?
[03:06:22] <belcher> btw as well as the bad security, SPV wallets usually also have bad privacy, since their server or peers can usually easily figure out the user's bitcoin addresses and transactions
[03:06:33] <belcher> any context? real life
[03:06:36] <shush> "51% of miners will turn down an offer to print free money" under what context?
[03:07:03] <shush> belcher: Then why do we assume miners wont do this tomorrow on the network?
[03:07:25] <shush> I mean to say: why are we assuming they wont
[03:07:28] <belcher> most of the network uses full nodes
[03:07:43] <belcher> full node wallets will reject invalid blocks, that includes blocks which print infinite bitcoins
[03:08:00] <belcher> so if miners did that today, they couldnt trade away those bitcoins at any exchange, or bisq trader or btcpayserver merchant
[03:08:19] <belcher> because those things dont use SPV (well bisq does but you can connect it to your own full node)

[03:09:16] <shush> So under this context we can assume "51% of miners will turn down an offer to print free money"
[03:09:33] <belcher> today miners do not have such an offer
[03:09:35] <shush> We're making a bad assumption as you said
[03:09:39] <belcher> because full node wallets are so widespread
[03:09:58] <belcher> but if SPV wallets were more widely used in the economy then that wouldnt be true, and miners really would gain that offer
[03:10:08] <shush> But the offer is there. You didn't say anything about whether the money is accepted or not

[08:13:08] <Henry151> hey y'all. I am experimenting with mining for a better conceptual understanding. I've come to a question: Do miners (current state-of-the-art asic miners, say), when looking for a correct nonce to append to the previous block hash, try random numbers, or do they try numbers sequentially?
[08:14:30] <Henry151> to be more specific, I'm looking at this: https://dplusplus.me/mining.html?003FF000000404CB000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000?angel336 and trying to figure out, "is the best strategy to try random nonces between 0 and 4294967295, or is the best strategy to try them sequentially starting at 0 or 42...."?

[08:20:07] <Henry151> i can only imagine that with all the great minds that have applied themselves to mining bitcoin, someone has likely found a definitive answer as to which approach is most effective. And my gut says trying random numbers in that range would be more likely to find a correct nonce faster, as opposed to trying numbers in that range sequentially from 0

[08:49:39] <Henry151> ok, so I think i've distilled the question down to a more simplified form: "If there are x correct answers randomly distributed between 0 and y, is it more effective to try each number between 0 and y sequentially, or to shuffle the set of numbers between 0 and y, and try the numbers in that shuffled set in their new shuffled order?"

[08:54:42] <plank> henry thats a subject youll find it difficult to find certain answers on. there are more efficient ways to mine than just incrementing the nonce, and some have been published. but the best methods will be kept as trade secrets by miners
[08:55:38] <_aj_> if you shuffle them in order of the value they give after being hashed, you'll get the optimal order :)
[08:55:45] <plank> i believe braiins makes money by supplying custom firmware for bitmain miners and taking a cut of the additional profit generated by their users
[08:56:10] *** Joins: kaish (~kaish@user/kaish)
[08:56:45] <plank> its more complicated than just messing with the nonce tho, there are other fields that can be messed with in the block header
[08:57:03] <plank> i would be more specific if my memory wasnt failing me right now
[08:59:33] <Victorsueca> Henry151: My guess would be that when trying them sequentially there is an increased risk of trying the exact same combination of block headers, transactions, nonce etc... that another miner has already checked to be the wrong answer. Asuming that shuffling can be done with an almost-zero time and energy cost, it would grant you a marginally higher chance that you're being the first to try hashing that block template instead of repeating

[09:13:45] <Ara> "...  when trying them sequentially there is an increased risk of trying the exact same combination of block headers..." This is not possible, each miner makes a block that pays themselves with a coinbase tx, and is therefore a unique block. No miner will check the same work
[09:14:05] <Henry151> is the simulation of bitcoin mining that i linked above simplified and so not factoring in that unique coinbase tx aspect?

[09:25:26] <Henry151> interesting, i see. Shuffling the numbers or trying to hold in memory all the ones that i have already tried will both have a cost
[09:26:08] <Henry151> i guess to create a shuffled set of 32 bit nonces and hold it in memory is impossible, because it's too many numbers to fit, right?
[09:27:31] <Ara> Well, if you have enough memory... It is only 4.2 billion values
[09:29:19] <Ara> But as I said before, you are not racing in the way you think. Two miners might both try nonce "0", but since their coinbase tx is different, that nonce results in two completely different hashes for the two miners
[09:30:02] <Henry151> ok. And that dplusplus.me link above i think is skipping that aspect of mining, for simplicity
[09:31:07] <Henry151> right? because in that link, if you and i both go to that link and try different nonces, we're literally racing to be the first to find a specific correct nonce (or one of a specific set of correct nonces in the range)
[09:31:26] <Ara> I dont click on links in this channel
[09:31:55] <Henry151> ok understandable :) it's a simulation of mining, they did it at the unconfiscatable bitcoin conference this weekend
[09:32:36] <Henry151> i am confident that i'm understanding that correctly though; the simulation of bitcoin mining they did there skipped over the part where a miner includes their coinbase tx before hashing
[09:33:13] <Henry151> so they had everybody typing in a "guess" into the nonce box, and hitting submit, and the first person to hit the correct nonce (or one of the multiple correct nonces) won.
[09:33:18] <Ara> coinbase tx is hashed into the merkle root, it definitely precedes the nonce in the block
[09:33:39] <Henry151> yeah, they provided a merkle root hash that was the same for all participants
[09:34:04] <Henry151> in reality, the merkle root hash is different for each miner, is what you're telling me, if i understand correctly, yes?

[09:39:42] <Henry151> now i'm really grasping it; we're not actually searching for the same "correct nonce" through the same set of possible correct nonces, instead, we're each digging through our own pile that has different correct nonces -- so even if we all start at 0, and go sequentially, you might find a correct nonce at number 15 and i might not find one until number 39, or vice-versa, because we're hashing a different
[09:39:48] <Henry151> thing
[09:42:05] <Ara> The nonce space is only 32 bits, so it is even possible that for a given merkle root and difficulty, there is no winning nonce in the entire range
[09:53:31] <Henry151> interesting... so a smart strategy, if i have more than one miner or my miner can try more than one merkle root at a time, would be to try multiple different combinations of merkle root and nonce? Perhaps instead of choosing one merkle root and trying a bunch of different nonces, could it be best to generate a set of different merkle roots (say by using different bitcoin addresses for the coinbase tx)
[09:53:37] <Henry151> and try one merkle root and one nonce, then another merkle root and another nonce, and so on?
[09:54:26] <Ara> I doubt it would give any speedup over just having your multiple miners work on different parts of the nonce space in parallel

[09:56:59] <Henry151> so if i try more than one merkle root, i increase the likelihood that one of those merkle roots has a valid nonce

[09:59:56] <Henry151> hmm that makes sense. But it also makes sense to me that trying with three different merkle roots means the likelihood that one of them has a correct nonce is greater than if i try with only one merkle root; so if i have three miners, having them work on three different merkle roots it would seem to increase the chance that one of them *has* a chance at finding a correct nonce/merkle root combination
[10:02:20] <Henry151> i'm imagining three sets of three cups upside down; there may or may not be a quarter under any one of the 9 cups; if i'm only going to have time to flip over three cups, i guess you're right, it is equally likely to find the quarter by flipping over three in one column, as flipping over one each from three columns. nevermind then, i see you're correct
[10:04:16] <Henry151> just took a minute for me to wrap my head around it :) thanks for your insight

[19:56:05] <Alexthek1d> hi
[19:56:43] <Alexthek1d> if you run a full node: can you query wallet balances without 3rd party libraries/software ?
[19:56:56] <Alexthek1d> so just with the pure node
[19:57:01] <Alexthek1d> and nothing more installed
[19:57:13] <Alexthek1d> i am not running a node yet so i ask
[19:58:53] <belcher> Alexthek1d yes
[19:59:06] <belcher> bitcoin-qt has a wallet
[19:59:30] <belcher> it can do things other wallets do like receive, send, see the balance, etc
[19:59:50] <Alexthek1d> belcher, oh u contributed much to this article right? https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Cold_storage
[20:00:02] <belcher> right
[20:00:12] <Alexthek1d> nice thanks alot for that
[20:01:05] <belcher> np
[20:01:57] <Alexthek1d> essentially i just want to check my offline cold storage paper wallet balance -> can you do this too if you run the full node in prune mode?
[20:01:58] <shesek> Alexthek1d, do you want to query for information about your own wallet addresses or of any arbitrary address?
[20:02:18] <Alexthek1d> shesek, own wallet but with total privacy
[20:02:20] <belcher> paper wallets are bad, dont use them, seed phrases are much better (and they can be written on paper)

[20:23:24] <Alexthek1d> so i am reading about seed phrasing right now. For paper wallets i would use just openssl with bash and python to generate a key. For seed phrases you would use a wallet software right? I didn't want to use software, because there could be some code in it, that could help the author to "guess" the keys in some way.
[20:23:45] <Alexthek1d> What would be the best software to trust for generating seed phrases?
[20:23:53] <belcher> openssl also has code in it
[20:24:08] <belcher> any good wallet generates seed phrases, i personally use electrum

[20:44:20] <belcher> you could also try it out on testnet/signet
[20:44:34] <belcher> which is like a test version of bitcoin, all the same but the coins are worthless so no problem if you lose them
[20:44:39] <belcher> bitcoin core and electrum all support signet
[20:45:10] <belcher> on the command line run electrum with --signet, read the bitcoin wiki page on signet there are links to sites that give you free signet coins
[20:48:01] <Earnest> There are some differences, such as WIF format, depending on which  *net is used

[21:04:42] <Earnest> It's not also entirely cpython's fault because that can be fairly reasonable

[21:05:13] <Earnest> I did profile it and meant to try and dig into just why it was so slow, but didn't get far

[21:10:15] <dodo> just do it if you want it
[21:10:16] <Earnest> cpython isn't so bad, and even C/C++ can be slow if programmers introduce quadratic execution
