[03:24:37] <Roey> *clean up
[03:24:40] <dfch> Yes, a small investment for infinite pleasure 
[03:24:46] <Roey> :))))
[03:24:54] <Roey> I mean mine was helluva expensive, but.. gosh so worth it
[03:24:54] <MootPoot> side benefit = no more stinky farts
[03:24:59] <Roey> aye!
[03:25:07] <dfch> Yes, WORTH IT
[03:25:08] <MootPoot> I've found out that stinky farts are cuz of low down poo
[03:25:14] <Roey> oh raeally??
[03:25:15] <MootPoot> it washes that out
[03:25:21] <MootPoot> so my farts are like a anime girl's now
[03:25:27] <Roey> maybe you have a point there, because I dont' smell bad farts now either.

[03:25:58] <dfch> Roey dfch is konata, ask Sadale to confirm
[03:25:58] <MootPoot> its to rip massive smell-less farts without blowing holes through their pants
[03:26:02] <Roey> LOL
[03:26:46] <Roey> see, before I got this bidet, I'd have to spend a few seconds in the shower at the end of the day, taking out all the shit that had caked between my buttocks over the course of shitting 3-5 times that day
[03:27:07] <Roey> even with wipin.
[03:27:09] <Roey> wiping.
[03:27:18] <Roey> but now everything always feels clean clean clean
[03:27:43] <amigojapan> 3 to 5 times in a day is a lot
[03:27:58] <amigojapan> I usually do it once per day
[03:28:02] <dfch> speaking of clean assholes...
[03:28:15] <MootPoot> if you get a  bidet you and your wife can try anal every day
[03:28:23] <MootPoot> lick her butthole all day without any worries
[03:28:25] <dfch> is there any anime about india MootPoot?

[05:12:35] <ButterNoodle> when I had all 4 of mine ripped, sawed, and yanked out of my head.. I lost 2 days worth of memory
[05:12:37] <sentionics> My dad was awake when they took his out. Being put to sleep for it is awesome, don't even remember going to sleep, just a surreal feeling when the assistant tells me it's all done.

[05:15:50] <sentionics> nah, not really
[05:15:57] <sentionics> or not that I've noticed I should say
[05:15:59] <mikau> I remember using a lot of ice for the swelling.
[05:16:23] <sentionics> I don't really feel any swelling, but that could just be the oxy

[05:51:40] <theholyduck> Why do you need days of to have it done?
[05:52:13] <theholyduck> If they put you under I could see that. Recovering from that is rougher.

[06:13:47] <sentionics> theholyduck: nice! sounds like it wasn't too rough for you then, ha ha.
[06:15:16] <sentionics> theholyduck: not sure, honestly, I get the impression that the oral surgeon I went does it like that most of the time, but I could be wrong. My X-Ray showed that one wisdom tooth was slipped partially under the adjacent tooth and pushing against it, the other on the bottom was half broken off.
[06:16:40] <sentionics> theholyduck: My dentist said, yeah, you NEED all of these removed. The oral surgeon he sent me to (who did the surgery today) said the same (though, uh, I'm sure he's all to happy to make the money off of doing it - not sure if they mark up money on top of the actual cost of the anaesthesia and time).
[06:18:15] <JesseDesu> sentioniccccsssssss
[06:18:42] <sentionics> I have a sneaking feeling, going off of how biting down on tough/hard foods with my sensitive broken off wisdom tooth caused an intense headache, that my 24/7 headache I had for 2 years a while back may have been tied to my teeth.
[06:18:49] <sentionics> Hey JesseDesu
[06:18:58] <JesseDesu> sup
[06:19:30] <sentionics> JesseDesu: I've got all 4 of my wisdom tooth out finally, and I'm quite stoned on this painkiller they gave me.
[06:19:44] <sentionics> One dose and I'm like... whoa. Also, totally kills the pain.
[06:22:34] <sentionics> Also, this makes 11 days of sobriety for me (won't be able to drink while my gums are healing from the extractions), but I've now taken a tight restructuring to my daily routine that seems to be working.
[06:24:03] <JesseDesu> whoa
[06:24:12] <JesseDesu> sober for so long
[06:25:06] <sentionics> I sometimes get up to 2 weeks, but it's not too common. Usually, I make it 5 - 7 days, then go on a bender for days. Rinse and repeat.
[06:26:05] <sentionics> I think part of it was due to lacking structure in my day, so now that I'm holding tight to my todolist (and log file that I have beside it to keep track of what got done for each day), I'm getting way more stuff done.
[06:26:46] <sentionics> something about seeing it on the list just makes me won't to not procrastinate and just get it done so I cut and paste it into log file (it's like collecting a trophy)
[06:27:02] <sentionics> *want to not procrastinate
[06:28:04] <JesseDesu> good for you man
[06:28:08] <sentionics> Every task starts with the todolist, and ends with it, so I'm immediately choosing the next task there, and sizing up what should be taking priority based on what's left. Even recreation like anime and youtube goes on there.
[06:28:54] <sentionics> Thanks Jesse, I feel like this could certainly be the first steps finally towards finding the light at the end of the road, ha ha.

[07:05:32] <sentionics> MootPoot: true. E.G. Setting clock speed on RAM higher than 3600 MHz doesn't really give any real benefit.
[07:05:48] <sentionics> ram speed usually isn't the bottleneck anyway
[07:06:08] <MootPoot> once you crack about 1500 dollars on a computer for most people going any higher isen't gonna get you anything better
[07:06:10] <sentionics> I think I read past 3100 MHz it's negligible

[07:34:15] <mixfix41`> that wil just take up desk real esate
[07:34:17] <MootPoot> idk, no consumer level systems have it available yet
[07:34:35] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  have you seen this guys desk
[07:34:36] <MootPoot> lol
[07:34:39] <MootPoot> I doubt he cares
[07:34:58] <mixfix41`> well im saying it fucks with the audio experience esp if you buy one and dont actually have to
[07:35:15] <MootPoot> ???
[07:35:17] <MootPoot> how tf
[07:35:30] <MootPoot> it does the very opposite of fucks your audio experience
[07:35:54] <mixfix41`> well fuck my opinion then.
[07:36:00] <JesseDesu> wtf is a DAC
[07:36:02] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  you know every single digital device ( smartphone, laptop, PC ) already has a DAC built in right
[07:36:08] <MootPoot> its just not very good
[07:36:33] <mixfix41`> okay but im not arguing i state what i meant
[07:36:36] <MootPoot> DAC is the electronics that convert sound data that your computer can read to sound data you can hear
[07:37:02] <JesseDesu> i just use defaults
[07:37:08] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: I am waiting for ddr69
[07:37:20] <mixfix41`> ive glimpse at how audio is process in recordings and such but why improve it i think the process is good enough
[07:37:31] <JesseDesu> butternoodle, mootpoot is making fun of my desk
[07:37:39] <ButterNoodle> yea its a disaster
[07:37:42] <MootPoot> if I gave you a usb with a song on it in mp3, you cant play that on your guitar
[07:37:46] <ButterNoodle> but
[07:38:05] <ButterNoodle> I worked w a guy that is the yardstick and the ruler for a messy desk
[07:38:29] <ButterNoodle> and urs is like a 3/10 - w 10 being the worst
[07:39:01] <JesseDesu> so i'm only 30%?
[07:39:07] <MootPoot> JesseDesu:  get a FiiO E10K and like maybe sony MDR 7506 headphones for like 200 bucks alltogether
[07:39:13] <MootPoot> see what you think
[07:39:17] <MootPoot> if you dont like it just return it
[07:39:32] <MootPoot> unless you secretly already have good headphones
[07:39:35] <MootPoot> and you're not telling us
[07:39:35] <ButterNoodle> they guy left on vacation, and we cleaned his desk - we found rotting fruit and used paper bowls for high fiber cereal and soy milk cause he was lactose intolerant...
[07:39:51] <JesseDesu> i'm spent
[07:39:53] <JesseDesu> sorry
[07:39:57] <ButterNoodle> buried under a mass of papers there were work requests and feature enhancements
[07:40:03] <JesseDesu> i gotta make do with what i have at the moment
[07:40:08] <MootPoot> werent you saving up for like a 2800 dollar guitar
[07:40:13] <ButterNoodle> it was the worst desk ever
[07:40:16] <ButterNoodle> so
[07:40:24] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: ur's is a 3
[07:41:02] <JesseDesu> i'm sad now
[07:41:16] <ButterNoodle> my fleshy ear holes cant tell the difference between 30$ headphones and 300$ headphones...
[07:41:26] <JesseDesu> you fuckers made me sad somehow
[07:41:40] <MootPoot> after you cross the 150-200 dollar point its all subjective really
[07:41:55] <MootPoot> there are some good 30 dollar headphones that sound as good as like 200 dollar ones

[07:43:13] <pteague> i can resell you a $30 pair of earbuds that i've put my name on & sell them to you for $200 ...
[07:44:28] <ButterNoodle> sounds like I will get cum in my ass...
[07:45:06] <mixfix41`> just buy the dollar earbuds then compare it to any headphone you get a hold of its teh best benchmarker
[07:45:22] <mixfix41`> none of this audio setup stuff its just jargon for sure
[07:45:33] <pteague> ButterNoodle, probably better than what i found typed in slack after i got home tonight ...

[07:47:54] <MootPoot> fuck that
[07:47:57] <MootPoot> nvm
[07:48:00] <pteague> MootPoot, exactly -.-
[07:48:40] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  because anyone without hearing damage can easily tell the difference between a dollar store pair of earbuds and a 200 dollar headset and dedicated DAC

[07:49:38] <mixfix41`> you always drag some weird dialogue out i have to admit
[07:49:43] <mixfix41`> its a marketing gimmick

[07:59:15] <MootPoot> sure, if thats the case then why sony headphones and apple airpods purchased en masse by these general consumers?
[07:59:50] <mixfix41`> what do you mean
[08:00:02] <mixfix41`> those headphones have performing components
[08:00:08] <mixfix41`> that would obv beat 1 dollar earbuds
[08:00:16] <mixfix41`> remember its a benchmark
[08:00:21] <mixfix41`> so those headphoens u name are still benchmarks
[08:00:27] <mixfix41`> anything better u think?
[08:00:28] <MootPoot> ....
[08:00:40] <MootPoot> you just switched sides

[08:00:50] <mixfix41`> u probs miss that word

[08:00:59] <mixfix41`> nope
[08:01:07] <MootPoot> lol its right in the logs
[08:01:07] <mixfix41`> first i say its jargon
[08:01:17] <mixfix41`> cause you buy quality headphones not a dac
[08:01:32] <mixfix41`> esp when you said dont spend more than 200 thats just misleading
[08:01:42] <mixfix41`> and saying to buy a dac

[08:02:01] <mixfix41`> theres headphones that can provide that experience and why a dac ull get angry you have it when u discover headphones
[08:02:09] <mixfix41`> that were what u were looking for
[08:02:28] * MootPoot fishslaps JesseDesu 
[08:02:41] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  those are headphones WITH dacs built in
[08:03:00] <MootPoot> without a dac you literally can not have a working set of headphones 
[08:03:01] <mixfix41`> im just saying you plateau your setup with a dac while you bought the wrong headphones you shouldve saved for audiophile quality 
[08:03:02] <mixfix41`> no
[08:03:06] <mixfix41`> what is this dac stuff???
[08:03:17] <mixfix41`> im talking smash components
[08:03:27] <mixfix41`> and you go on paragraphs about other topics
[08:03:51] <MootPoot> its the thing that converts your mp3 to waveforms that your headphones can understand and turn into sound you can hear
[08:03:51] <mixfix41`> you dont eeven need a dac for a phonoegrph
[08:04:14] <MootPoot> for any digital device, if you want music from it, you NEED a DAC
[08:04:25] <MootPoot> it can be built in, or seperate. The best ones are usually seperate
[08:04:43] <mixfix41`> yeah so a dac but people using record players were like just 'get the speakers'
[08:04:54] <death916>  need an amp not a dac

[08:07:38] <death916> not only for subs
[08:07:39] <mixfix41`> yea if you want good speakers
[08:07:43] <mixfix41`> but im not arguing that
[08:07:51] <mixfix41`> a bedroom and digital speaker works
[08:07:58] <MootPoot> what are you arguing?
[08:08:00] <MootPoot> state it clearly
[08:08:03] <mixfix41`> im saying tho
[08:08:04] <death916> just cuz it works doesnt mean its right
[08:08:16] <death916> or the best
[08:08:18] <mixfix41`> 500 for in ear microphones compare to a 200 and dac is a better sound exp.
[08:08:35] <mixfix41`> that was the whole jist of the argument
[08:08:38] <MootPoot> I'm arguing a dac and /or a dedicated Amp will give you a better qualitative experience then just using inbuilt stuff in your computer
[08:08:44] <mixfix41`> you never even touch on audiophile in ear microphones
[08:08:57] <death916> audipphile iem usually get ampd too
[08:09:00] <mixfix41`> yea but thats extra peripherals im not trying to juggle with
[08:09:04] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  so your entire argument is instead of going 50/50 on dac and headphones you want 20/80 instead
[08:09:07] <MootPoot> thats it
[08:09:13] <death916> no 100/0\
[08:09:16] <mixfix41`> i own a pair so i dont have anything in beteween the 3.5 mm jack
[08:09:17] <death916> is their argument i think
[08:09:34] <JesseDesu> 69/
[08:09:35] <MootPoot> 0 on dac and amp and 100% on headphones?
[08:09:36] <mixfix41`> im saying dont have the dac
[08:09:42] <mixfix41`> in my cases
[08:09:53] <death916> its basically statistically proven that amp/dac + any sound is better
[08:09:57] <mixfix41`> i would never buy an amp or dac unless i got subs for my automobile
[08:10:03] <death916> then jus good speakers/iems
[08:10:04] <mixfix41`> there ill only need an amp
[08:10:05] <mixfix41`> for power
[08:10:15] <MootPoot> I guess if your headphones were super easy to drive you dont need an Amp
[08:10:21] <death916> ya
[08:10:30] <MootPoot> but a dac will help over anything thats in a normal pc/phone
[08:10:55] <MootPoot> death916:  all I'm running is a rode mini mic and I'm using the headphone amp/dac combo in that
[08:10:57] <MootPoot> literally thats it

[08:13:46] <MootPoot> very few
[08:13:50] <MootPoot> LG makes some good ones
[08:13:50] <amigojapan> death916: autom√°tic cars have gears
[08:13:51] <MootPoot> I have one
[08:13:54] <mixfix41`> "buy another peice" you still never recommend the correct equipment to begin with
[08:14:00] <death916> not really amigojapan
[08:14:02] <death916> not svts
[08:14:12] <death916> which most cars are now
[08:14:17] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  I already recommneded JesseDesu  what to get for his desktop computer setup lol
[08:14:21] <mixfix41`> dont believe moot fine
[08:14:23] <MootPoot> you're talking about your inears
[08:14:28] <mixfix41`> its not anyones loss actually
[08:14:35] <amigojapan> Ok death916 I don't know those
[08:14:43] <JesseDesu> MootPoot, i forgot already
[08:14:44] <death916> semi variable transmission
[08:14:46] <death916> or something liek that
[08:14:57] <death916> i forgot what it stands for bit their werid and i hate them
[08:15:00] <death916> theyre
[08:15:10] <mixfix41`> i was arguing correct equipment and the point to that equipment which make it the good choice
[08:15:19] <mixfix41`> your shit will drain the fuck out of electronics pretty quick i think
[08:15:25] <JesseDesu> amigojapan, how was your day
[08:15:40] <death916> i jus use my galaxy bud pros samsung scalable codec goes to like 1000 kbs
[08:15:44] <death916> almost full flac lvl
[08:15:45] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: just got up but thanks for asking
[08:15:57] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  its a desktop setup, theres no point worrying about batteries lol
[08:15:59] <JesseDesu> lol
[08:15:59] <death916> im at work so cant bring amp n shit lol
[08:16:07] <mixfix41`> no very versatile then
[08:16:10] <mixfix41`> but have at it
[08:16:30] <MootPoot> we were literally only talking about desk-based use
[08:16:33] <MootPoot> the entire time
[08:16:35] <MootPoot> lol
[08:16:39] <mixfix41`> you can get the in ear microphones for the price it takes you to find how good they are so whats so bad about that advice?
[08:17:08] <mixfix41`> yes
[08:17:12] <mixfix41`> and i still had a point
[08:17:20] <mixfix41`> just keep it simple with a connection to the 3.5mm jack
[08:17:25] <mixfix41`> and a piece of hardware
[08:17:30] <mixfix41`> i can use cheap headphones too
[08:17:30] <MootPoot> and use the shit DAC on the laptop
[08:17:33] <mixfix41`> its just what i have on hand
[08:17:36] <mixfix41`> no
[08:17:38] <mixfix41`> not a shit dac
[08:17:41] <death916> ya it is
[08:17:42] <mixfix41`> upgrade your headphones
[08:17:45] <mixfix41`> is all i say
[08:17:49] <mixfix41`> sure
[08:17:53] <mixfix41`> but
[08:17:53] <mixfix41`> its a waste
[08:17:55] <MootPoot> I mean mixfix41`  is half right
[08:17:55] <death916> laptop soundcards n daacs r trash
[08:18:06] <death916> even most desktop mobos have shit sound
[08:18:07] <MootPoot> but its like buying a lamborghini and only putting 87 octane in it
[08:18:13] <mixfix41`> laptops with battery is basically a desktop
[08:18:22] <death916> no
[08:18:24] <death916> they use smaller
[08:18:25] <JesseDesu> yes
[08:18:25] <death916> cheaper
[08:18:26] <mixfix41`> so where this power is not a consideration is ridiculous
[08:18:27] <death916> less heat parts
[08:18:32] <death916> which are not as good
[08:18:43] <JesseDesu> no
[08:18:52] <death916> have u seen the sound card on some desktop mobos they wouldnt even fit in most laptops
[08:18:58] <death916> they thicc
[08:19:27] <JesseDesu> thicc
[08:19:35] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  have you tried using a dedicated DAC with your good in ears / headphones
[08:19:50] <death916> mixfix41` do u listen to compressed audio as well
[08:19:56] <death916> 124 aac
[08:20:03] <death916> no dac no flac
[08:20:07] <JesseDesu> mixfix41`, 
[08:20:24] <MootPoot> I have a running amazon music ultimate subscription
[08:20:27] <MootPoot> its pretty damn nice
[08:20:28] <mixfix41`> okay but you can sample the in ear microphones from 1964 where can i get a free sample of a dac to ship to me?
[08:21:10] <mixfix41`> no i dont save flac
[08:21:13] <MootPoot> 1.) I cant sample in ears from 1964, I dont have any that old or any source 2.) go buy it from amazon, and try it then return it for free if you dont like it
[08:21:13] <mixfix41`> still
[08:21:16] <mixfix41`> i have a very good point
[08:21:42] <mixfix41`> ur talking about consumers stepping up from 1 dollar ear buds they are not gonna wanna dac in inventory when they can hear the basic quality jump
[08:21:50] <mixfix41`> a dac is unnessary before that point
[08:22:02] <death916> tru
[08:22:08] <MootPoot> .... I'm not recommending anyone use 1 dollar earbuds
[08:22:09] <MootPoot> lmao
[08:22:21] <death916> idk have u ever tried some nice skullcandies
[08:22:24] <mixfix41`> its a frisbee moot
[08:22:26] <death916> those were dope in like 05
[08:22:35] <MootPoot> if you only have the money for 1 dollar buds then its pointless to get a dac I agree
[08:22:39] <mixfix41`> u have no company where i can sample a dac that means its a marketing gimmick to my deaf ears!
[08:22:52] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  I litreally just told you how to get one for free to sample
[08:22:59] <MootPoot> or just go to an audio store and ask
[08:23:02] <MootPoot> they'll have one
[08:23:08] <mixfix41`> death916: except skullcandy bt speakers still rock
[08:23:13] <MootPoot> multiple actually
[08:23:32] <mixfix41`> the battery life on those are acceptable and (it wont pump sound like a lot) but when u need sound i recommend em
[08:23:38] <MootPoot> what I'm saying is that if you get a good set of inears or headphones, you're missing out on their full capability by not getting a good DAC alongside it
[08:23:55] <mixfix41`> skullcandy shrapnel bt speakers
[08:24:02] <mixfix41`> there like 15 bucks or 10 if you can find em
[08:24:02] <death916> ok buch rlly u need headphones that support 360 audio for the full hentai experience
[08:24:09] <MootPoot> lmao
[08:24:12] <JesseDesu> i get my headphones from Ross
[08:24:15] <death916> so u can feel like the tentacle monster is inside u as well
[08:24:18] <mixfix41`> im not lying about the IEM
[08:24:22] <mixfix41`> so im just saying
[08:24:32] <MootPoot> JesseDesu:  woah thats pretty good already
[08:24:42] <mixfix41`> the chore is buying the IEM
[08:24:43] <mixfix41`> true
[08:24:44] *** Joins: Tetza (~parra@2800:484:2481:27b0:19b6:a47e:e788:f387)
[08:24:47] <death916> i jus bought some fila shoes from ross
[08:24:47] <MootPoot> so just try them out with a DAC, and see what you think, if you dont care then just return it
[08:24:51] <death916> theyre dope snd was like 30 bux lol
[08:24:57] <mixfix41`> but a bigger chore would have a dac gather dust that u thought u want to include
[08:25:19] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  have you ever tried a dedicated dac
[08:25:33] <mixfix41`> already address taht comment
[08:25:42] <MootPoot> you haven't.
[08:25:46] <mixfix41`> you not only influence me moot its every consumer out there
[08:25:56] <mixfix41`> so u are kinda repeating urself
[08:26:00] <MootPoot> most consumers dont have a dedicated dac lol
[08:26:15] <mixfix41`> so why johnny blaze for dacs
[08:26:28] <mixfix41`> its not necessary 
[08:26:38] <MootPoot> ^ I never said it was neccessary
[08:26:42] <MootPoot> I said it was BETTER
[08:26:59] <mixfix41`> i wouldnt trade my iem setup for it
[08:27:09] <MootPoot> you can use your iems with a dedicated dac
[08:27:10] <MootPoot> lol
[08:27:10] <mixfix41`> so try the dac and phone first before IEM
[08:27:13] <mixfix41`> no
[08:27:19] <mixfix41`> a dac is not necessary to purchase
[08:27:19] <MootPoot> are they wireless?
[08:27:27] <mixfix41`> you need to understand that
[08:27:41] <MootPoot> I never said a dac was neccessary lol
[08:27:52] <MootPoot> I just said it was better then using the basic one your device has
[08:27:53] <MootPoot> thats it
[08:27:58] <mixfix41`> nope
[08:28:10] <mixfix41`> i wouldnt buy a dac unless i felt reall compell to
[08:28:18] <mixfix41`> definitely not compeling enough for me to
[08:28:19] <MootPoot> good for you
[08:28:22] <mixfix41`> why
[08:28:29] <MootPoot> that dosen't really change any of the facts
[08:28:29] <mixfix41`> cause my setup would have a dac gather dust if i had one?
[08:28:34] <mixfix41`> yea it does..
[08:28:40] <mixfix41`> i wuldnt even hook it up i thik

[08:28:56] <mixfix41`> nah
[08:29:00] <mixfix41`> thats where you find you are wrong
[08:29:02] <MootPoot> if your happy as is, thats fine

[08:30:22] <MootPoot> JesseDesu:  yes
[08:30:26] <JesseDesu> i feel like you need a hug
[08:30:32] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  I never said that was wrong though
[08:30:35] * JesseDesu hugs MootPoot 
[08:31:08] <MootPoot> I'm not arguing about what the best "low power" way is to enjoy music
[08:31:15] <mixfix41`> practical though
[08:31:18] <MootPoot> I'm arguing about what the best way overall is to enjoy music
[08:31:20] <MootPoot> thats it
[08:31:27] <MootPoot> whatever you're bringing up is irrelvant
[08:31:27] <mixfix41`> low power is very practical
[08:31:31] <mixfix41`> no its not
[08:31:35] <MootPoot> we're not talking about practiciality
[08:31:38] <MootPoot> or at least I never was
[08:31:53] <mixfix41`> ear buds that have good components is basically all you need
[08:32:01] <mixfix41`> or cans
[08:32:07] <mixfix41`> probs both 
[08:32:12] <MootPoot> true, but I'm talking about "wants" not "needs"
[08:32:17] <mixfix41`> also
[08:32:24] <MootPoot> if you want to talk about needs, just get a 1 dollar set of earbuds
[08:32:25] <mixfix41`> i dont think you can measure the power draw to those of IEM
[08:32:25] <MootPoot> thats it

[08:35:44] <MootPoot> mixfix41`:  it seems you're hung up on the difference between needs and wants and the parameters of what I'm talking about

[08:35:55] <MootPoot> JesseDesu:  did you get that guitar
[08:36:02] <mixfix41`> definitely IME so in your experience this clashes
[08:36:03] <JesseDesu> no
[08:36:11] <mixfix41`> but the point still stands
[08:36:20] <MootPoot> will you stick anime stickers on it JesseDesu 
[08:36:23] <mixfix41`> IEM are sufficient to use on any equipment dacless or not

[08:53:30] <MootPoot> hmm.... 10.5k for a 4 year old honda VFR 1200X
[08:53:39] <MootPoot> with 57000km on the odo
[08:53:46] <MootPoot> about 30k miles or something I guess
[08:54:04] <ButterNoodle> I think the vfr12s look like shit
[08:54:11] <MootPoot> y
[08:54:17] <MootPoot> dont like the ADV look?
[08:54:17] <ButterNoodle> that ugly factory pipe

[08:54:32] <MootPoot> ah
[08:54:33] <MootPoot> I see it
[08:54:35] <ButterNoodle> it was a sportbike
[08:54:37] <MootPoot> looks pretty barebones
[08:54:46] <ButterNoodle> the vfr800 was tits
[08:55:26] <MootPoot> actually thats not bad... the 4.5k for a new gsx250rz
[08:55:27] <ButterNoodle> I mean the vfrs were under powered compared to the cbrs from the late 90s on
[08:55:30] <MootPoot> with a 5 year warrenty
[08:55:46] <MootPoot> probably not comfy tho

[08:56:50] <ButterNoodle> well a vf500
[08:57:00] <MootPoot> as long as I stay under 400cc and my bike is not a supersport my insurance shouldnt rape me...right?
[08:57:15] <JesseDesu> my honda hawk had a cbr f2 front end
[08:57:19] <ButterNoodle> idk ur under 25...
[08:57:32] <ButterNoodle> insurance sucks in merica if ur under 25
[08:57:38] <MootPoot> well, I'll be 25 next riding season

[12:00:06] <saganman> amigojapan: my mother is okay with that and my father tried convincing saying everyone is getting married, why not you
[12:00:41] <saganman> amigojapan: all they care is about what others think and what to say when others ask them.
[12:00:41] <amigojapan> saganman: tell them "I am different form everyone
[12:01:00] <saganman> amigojapan: I wish I could just die.
[12:01:18] <saganman> They‚Äôre are mentally torturing them.
[12:01:29] <saganman> Torturing me*
[12:01:51] <amigojapan> Ouch
[12:02:12] <saganman> amigojapan: my father likes to bring up the past and all the screw ups I did.
[12:02:44] <saganman> amigojapan: and their go to is how they are just living for me
[12:03:38] <amigojapan> saganman: I am sorry
[12:04:08] <amigojapan> saganman: tell him "nobody is perfect
[12:04:22] <saganman> Yeah amigojapan
[12:07:07] <amigojapan> saganman: also sorry I did not know who was calling at first
[12:09:30] <saganman> it's alright amigojapan

[12:11:29] <saganman> amigojapan: if there's anything I learned, not to get into relationships
[12:11:36] <saganman> too much trouble
[12:12:08] <amigojapan> saganman: I think even tho now may be tough. In the future it should be better if your parents understand you are not intending to get married

[12:13:55] <DunceCotus> amigojapan hey
[12:14:04] <amigojapan> saganman: then maybe tell them "think about what to tell society by yourselves"
[12:14:27] <DunceCotus> tell them society does not exist after Margaret Thatcher
[12:15:36] <saganman> Lol
[12:16:58] <saganman> Huh amigojapan, they are impossible to talk to. I will follow my earlier strategy and just tell the matches that I‚Äôm not interested.
[12:17:35] <DunceCotus> saganman maybe you can find a like-minded girl and have a pretend marriage
[12:17:42] <DunceCotus> gets your parents off your back and you can move out
[12:17:52] <DunceCotus> then you can quietly divorce or something later on
[12:18:10] <saganman> Yeah
[12:18:18] <amigojapan> saganman: this is one sudden blow but it should help you better in the future. If you go back to that you will suffer for ever
[12:20:06] <amigojapan> saganman: anyway, I am sorry you are suffering so much
[12:22:12] <saganman> it's alright amigojapan

[12:26:30] <amigojapan> saganman: how old are your parents?
[12:27:47] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: getting married like that would duck for the girl. So I would not do it
[12:28:39] <DunceCotus> duck?
[12:29:07] <DunceCotus> why would it duck for the girl? Girl can make her own choices
[12:29:10] <saganman> amigojapan: 63 and 60
[12:29:46] <DunceCotus> saganman what happens if you give into taboo
[12:30:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: getting married with the intention of divorce can't end well
[12:31:39] <DunceCotus> well the idea is its fake, to keep up appearances to begin with
[12:31:50] <DunceCotus> but then over time you grow attached and real love happens maybe
[12:32:23] <DunceCotus> only way that plan could fail is if saganman is gay
[12:32:35] <amigojapan> saganman: it says Indian lifespan is average 69.42 years (2018
[12:32:39] <saganman> If only I were gay.

[12:38:42] <DunceCotus> jesus
[12:38:48] <DunceCotus> is anything not a taboo in india

[12:39:41] <death916> you sure
[12:39:50] <saganman> DunceCotus: thankfully we have a liberal judiciary which has decriminalized gay sex
[12:39:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan isn't it?
[12:39:54] <darkwitch> probably taboo to drink the wrong water
[12:40:24] <DunceCotus> saganman hmm then its kinda similar to the west
[12:40:34] <saganman> DunceCotus: you know some Indians drink cow urine? They think it‚Äôs good for health.
[12:40:51] <DunceCotus> yes the west is more accepting of homosexuality but 'gay' is still used as a derogatory
[12:40:59] <darkwitch> blech
[12:41:03] <DunceCotus> and people still throw things at two men holding hands in street etc
[12:41:32] <amigojapan> saganman: in Mexico sume people think human urine is healthy too drink :|
[12:41:35] <DunceCotus> saganman they may be right to an extent
[12:42:01] <DunceCotus> old wives tales often have a grain or two of truth to them

[12:53:01] <mixfix41`> insulin shots and stuff like that . doctors know them better or doctoral students too.
[12:53:02] <DunceCotus> amigojapan the problem with western medicine is they are too quick to be skeptical about folk remedies
[12:53:18] <DunceCotus> but then do experiments and find that folk remedies are often the best remedies they can come up with
[12:53:27] <DunceCotus> aside from brute-force methods like antibiotics, chemo etc
[12:54:10] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Steve Jobs may be alive if he did but follow herbal medicine
[12:54:34] <amigojapan> If he did not
[12:54:43] <mixfix41`> downfall is the business contract instead of the potential im not sure the weakness is skepticism its more about paper
[12:56:01] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I doubt I would be alive today if it were not for modern medicine
[12:56:25] <mixfix41`> think the evidence lies that most people who declare bankruptcy with medical bills were also insure so the hospitals did get the insurance money too
[12:57:34] <amigojapan> mixfix41`: the insurance should be run internally by the government. Not by private insurance companies
[12:57:34] <saganman> DunceCotus: western medicine is found on principles of science and on other hand folk remedies are based upon beliefs
[12:57:50] <mixfix41`> yea you walk in the in the hospital the treatment from staff is usually always good
[12:58:14] <saganman> some folk medicine might work because of there is something medicinal or because of placebo effect
[12:58:43] <Sapphirus> placebo effect is a well documented phenomena.
[12:58:46] <DunceCotus> saganman we also have to believe in science
[12:58:53] <DunceCotus> that is scientific methodologies
[12:59:10] <mixfix41`> god to go to a hospitol even for electric shock since that can give you cardiac arrest i wonder the stats on success failure to treat cases such as these
[12:59:17] <amigojapan> saganman: Japanese kanpo medicine is Chinese traditional medicine that was tested scientifically
[12:59:27] <saganman> yeah, the good thing about science is, it is true regardless of our beliefs
[13:01:13] <saganman> amigojapan: It depends on who have tested it and all. There are no rules and regulations for medical testing so what happens is these tests are quite rigged by taking only the cases which were positive. It happens a lot in homeopathy.

[14:14:54] <amigojapan> saganman: yes, on Sunday. That's after my Sunday job
[14:16:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I love it too. But still I put sailor moon as my favourite. But Eva is probably my second favourite and then suzumiya haruhi no yuutsu

[14:24:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I don't do hot ones

[14:25:05] <amigojapan> I see DunceCotus 
[14:25:18] <darkwitch> pokemon counts a lot
[14:25:25] <death916> no
[14:25:27] <darkwitch> all the merch
[14:25:38] <DunceCotus> is bleach even good
[14:25:45] <DunceCotus> I don't like these infinite animes
[14:25:52] <DunceCotus> neverending I mean
[14:25:53] <darkwitch> is bleach even popular in japan?
[14:25:55] <death916> i mean it hsouldnt count in a top anime by country ppl dont even know pokemon is an anime in us
[14:26:36] <darkwitch> where is the yu-gi-oh country? I can't find it
[14:26:42] <saganman> DunceCotus: there are also lot of religious symbolism in eva
[14:27:25] <DunceCotus> saganman there is, but I'd say its mostly meaningless
[14:27:36] <death916> i watched eva in english while playin vidyagames
[14:27:42] <DunceCotus> Anno even admitted he just threw religious symbols in there cause it looked cool
[14:27:47] <death916> so i feel like i barely watched it
[14:28:23] <saganman> Wow death916, I don‚Äôt think anyone watched Eva like that.
[14:28:33] <death916> haha
[14:28:59] <death916> SHIIINJIIIIII sounds so much better in english
[14:29:17] <saganman> I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even possible to watch Eva like that.

[14:39:24] <DunceCotus> they tried to de-gay kaworu for english versions
[14:39:39] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that is evil
[14:40:02] <DunceCotus> well kaworu is an angel and angel = bad in eva
[14:40:08] <DunceCotus> or at least morally ambiguous
[14:40:28] <DunceCotus> so its basically of course the only gay character is an angel
[14:40:44] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in Japanese they are not angels, they are apostles
[14:40:44] <DunceCotus> who 'tempts' shinji into being gay
[14:41:10] <DunceCotus> amigojapan interesting
[14:41:28] <DunceCotus> my point stands tho
[14:41:38] <amigojapan> Ok
[14:41:42] <DunceCotus> like kaworu was gay but they presented that species as evil
[14:41:59] *** Quits: TheAceOfHearts (~TheAceOfH@24.41.239.76) (Quit: So long, and thanks for all the fish!)
[14:41:59] <DunceCotus> so its like the only humanoid angel/apostle is gay.. cause gay is evil?
[14:42:28] <DunceCotus> however the relationship he has with Shinji is probably the most tender thing in all of eva
[14:42:36] <DunceCotus> and shows maybe some kind of truce is possible
[14:43:01] <amigojapan> Yep
[14:43:45] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I think they changed it to "angels"to avoid the religious backlash
[14:44:27] <DunceCotus> not sure how angels is better than apostles 
[14:44:32] <DunceCotus> but I guess there are the 'fallen angels'
[14:44:51] <hassoon> any thing fallen is liek an ascended version of it
[14:44:57] <hassoon> fallen angel, fallen creature
[14:44:58] <amigojapan> Apostles are the people who followed Jesus

[15:05:51] <amigojapan> I wonder why the back
[15:07:12] <DunceCotus> back is immuno-regulative?
[15:07:25] <amigojapan> Have no idea
[15:13:51] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: joint pain is a known side effect. But is the lower back considered a joint?

[15:14:53] <amigojapan> ImoutoBot: is broken

[19:30:11] <Sadale> SpiritOfSummer, don't purchase 3D printer for printing anime models. Lower-end 3D printers doesn't have good enough quality for that. And I'm not sure if there's any consumer grade 3D printer that can produce model of such quality

[19:33:11] <SpiritOfSummer> my understanding comes from the images available on the internet, but I'll take your word for it
[19:33:22] <SpiritOfSummer> Sadale: I've had various conversations in another channel about this with someone, and he didn't mention that 
[19:34:01] <Sadale> SpiritOfSummer, ah. He probably got a decent 3D printer. Ask which model of 3D printer he's using.
[19:34:26] <Sadale> SpiritOfSummer, FYI: SLA 3D printers (the one that uses resin instead of filament) produce smoother surface.
[19:35:17] <Sadale> The parts produced by FDM looks kind of meh. The surface doesn't look good ootb. You probably want to sand it for figurines if you have the skill to do so, which I don't :P
[19:35:23] <SpiritOfSummer> Sadale: well to be honest
[19:35:30] <SpiritOfSummer> what you said is what sounds more realistic
[19:35:54] <Sadale> To me tho I mostly use the 3D printer for printing mechanical parts. So it isn't a problem to me.
[19:36:18] <Sadale> Oh one more thing about 3D printer. It's slow af. It's good for prototyping tho. For mass production, not so much.
[19:36:47] <SpiritOfSummer> Sadale: from what I can tell about 3d printing, it's shaky business a lot of the time
[19:36:56] <Sadale> For reference, my 3D printer takes an hour to print a 30g part, plus setup and cool dowwn time.
[19:37:02] <amigojapan> Sadale: maybe you can upscale the 3d model to a size where fine resolution does not matter so much
[19:37:22] <Sadale> amigojapan, true.
[19:37:29] <Sadale> amigojapan, nah no thanks. I've nowhere to store that :P

[23:13:23] <ButterNoodle> I mean I'm a dirty old bastard, but I respect the pussy... maybe even worship it a bit like a shrine.. and treat women (and men) like human beings
[23:14:04] <ButterNoodle> *equally
[23:14:18] <theholyduck> the pay/promotion discrimination examples are so plentiful
[23:14:43] <MootPoot> tbh I still mess around like that at times but never when women are around really
[23:14:58] <MootPoot> although Its gotten much less in freqency as me and my group get older
[23:15:09] * MootPoot grabs his anti-cootie spray
[23:15:10] <ButterNoodle> yea, I had a good engineer quit because of indirect harassment.. I wanted her to go to HR tbh
[23:15:28] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: theres a bunch of stories in here about how hr did absolutly fuckall
[23:15:29] <MootPoot> but never at work
[23:15:36] <theholyduck> and even a woman who worked in HR getting pushed out
[23:15:37] <MootPoot> dont do that shit or anything close at work
[23:15:40] <theholyduck> for trying to do anything about it

[23:15:53] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: I refrain from any joking like that at work these days..
[23:16:08] <sentionics> I think I can see how people can get hooked on oxy

[23:16:58] <sentionics> I don't think I could function if I were on this all the time though.
[23:17:17] <ButterNoodle> I really wanted this old fuck to get fired.. he was a fuckup - negative head count - objectively racist, sexist, and overly religious
[23:17:20] <theholyduck> ... when i had wisedomtooth surgery i just used paracetamol + ibuprofen
[23:17:29] <ButterNoodle> idk how all that happens.. but he was in his 60s
[23:17:30] <theholyduck> they give you guys fucking opiods for such a minor thing?
[23:17:41] <ButterNoodle> yes
[23:17:45] <ButterNoodle> bc merica
[23:17:50] <Jigsy> It's finally thundering.
[23:17:51] <MootPoot> I want to get my wisdom teeth removed and reinstalled in my asshole
[23:17:58] <MootPoot> so I can't get raped if I ever go to prison
[23:18:00] <MootPoot> just bite down
[23:18:15] <ButterNoodle> so ur planning on going to prison MootPoot?? want some practice?
[23:18:24] <MootPoot> I dont want to
[23:18:25] <MootPoot> but 
[23:18:25] <theholyduck> i GOT some stronger painkillers with mine with instructions to only take them if it wasnt bearable on regular painkillers
[23:18:36] <sentionics> theholyduck: yeah, I guess it's pretty common here. I was lowkey expecting them to Rx it for me. I didn't ask or anything.
[23:18:39] <ButterNoodle> #metoo theholyduck..
[23:18:44] <MootPoot> given what the govt here is doing with gun owners...any excuse they can get theri hands on
[23:18:58] <ButterNoodle> I cant take opioids anyway.. I puke my brains out
[23:19:09] <MootPoot> plug it up with a cock
[23:19:15] <ButterNoodle> lol MootPoot 
[23:19:29] <sentionics> I only just barely tolerate the anxiety increase it gives me tbh. I couldn't do this stuff all the time.
[23:19:56] <theholyduck> and what i got was i think was 10 30mg pills that had 30mg of some codeine derivative in them
[23:20:17] <theholyduck> kodeinfosfatsesquihydrat is the norweigan name
[23:21:23] <theholyduck> combined with 400mg paracetamol in them aswell
[23:21:34] <sentionics> theholyduck: my doses comes in 10/325 percocet tablets (so roughly 10 mg oxy, 325 tylenol if I'm reading it right, though one site says it's actually more like 8.6 mg of oxy)
[23:22:56] <theholyduck> sentionics: my point was i didnt actually need to take any 
[23:22:57] <theholyduck> :D
[23:23:32] <MootPoot> I remember this one girl who was really into the feminism and proving herself stuff
[23:23:43] <MootPoot> we'd get assigned group projects and usually I did my part

[23:24:01] <MootPoot> but when I was stuck with her I'd be like "oh you cant do it, your a girl"
[23:24:24] <sentionics> I'm kinda just took it yesterday for the easy pain relief, but also out of curiosity. Now I'm just taking it to make today easy as well. My gums are sore but not really needing it, tbh.
[23:24:31] <MootPoot> and fuck the girl would crunch through a weeks worth of work in 1 day and come back next morning and show us , and we'd be like "damn you showed us"
[23:24:39] <MootPoot> and we'd all get an A+ grade
[23:24:40] <MootPoot> lmao
[23:25:21] <MootPoot> spend the whole week at home just playing split screen games at my house

[23:35:55] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle:  we were like 9 years old
[23:36:00] <ButterNoodle> and..
[23:36:04] <MootPoot> my pp didnt go up at the time
[23:36:09] <ButterNoodle> O.o
[23:36:32] <MootPoot> I watched euphoria the same year and I was like "adults be weird man"
[23:36:39] <sentionics> I don't recall ever being so young that my pp couldn't go up. Guess that's a genetics thing or something.
[23:36:51] <ButterNoodle> noice on lastonestanding 
[23:37:14] <lastonestanding> it's 3x the same girl
[23:37:23] <ButterNoodle> yes
[23:37:27] <ButterNoodle> I seen that
[23:37:30] <MootPoot> I want a cute girl to take to cafes and buy her doughnuts
[23:37:38] <lastonestanding> it took me several replays to notice that :D
[23:37:39] <MootPoot> then pound her doughtnut later
[23:37:59] <ButterNoodle> *eat her jelly donut
[23:38:15] <MootPoot> its day 2 of my vroptiican order
[23:38:21] <MootPoot> still says preparing order
[23:38:25] <MootPoot> dammit amazon is faster then this
[23:38:27] <sentionics> I think I may give weed tinctures another chance later on. Basically it's a body high like this oxy, but probably way safer.
[23:38:33] <MootPoot> damn
[23:38:41] <MootPoot> I haven't heard that word in forever sentionics 
[23:38:41] <Nanobot> HoloEN all-member collab today in 3 hours: killing the ender dragon, after which they will start the process of connecting the HoloEN server to the HoloJP server.
[23:38:47] <MootPoot> its been like 10 years
[23:38:59] <MootPoot> Nanobot:  there are different servers?
[23:39:00] <MootPoot> wha
[23:39:04] <sentionics> I'll just have to do it super low dose though, last time I just went too high last time I did it.
[23:39:09] <MootPoot> its like the marvel multiverse but for hololive MC servers
[23:39:23] <sentionics> MootPoot: tincture is a fun word, lol.
[23:39:49] * sentionics consumes an tincture. HP restored by 5%!
[23:39:52] <Nanobot> MootPoot: HoloEN started their server within their first month. Hololive has a one-month collab ban for all new members, so they couldn't interact with HoloJP on stream, which is why they made their own Minecraft server. But now, they want to join them together.
[23:40:08] <MootPoot> rip the server admin 
[23:40:16] <sentionics> my typing may or may not be effected by the fact that I'm high on oxy right now.
[23:40:35] <Nanobot> HoloEN is only five members (well, six, but the sixth can't collab yet), and they rarely play at the same time.
