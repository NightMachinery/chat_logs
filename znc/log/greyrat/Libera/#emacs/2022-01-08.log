[05:47:43] <nij-> I load the file `load-cl.el` from [1] and get the error in [2]. Before the error, the macro DEFVAR has been defined. In the error, it shows that (DEFVAR *RANDOM-STATE* (nil)) was actually read as (defvar *RANDOM-STATE* (nil)), which leads to the error because defvar is not a macro. I wonder why this happens. Why would #'load read the symbol DEFVAR as the symbol defvar?

[06:32:24] <Guest21> edrx so, what I know so far: there's this variable 'hl-line-range-function' which sets the overlay boundaries (but overlays seem to be contiguous so they can't just 'skip' a button); that said, there's also apparently a priority to the overlay of -50, so any other overlay I apply would take priority; but buttons don't have such overlays, they seem
[06:32:24] <Guest21> to just be, uh, their own text properties region (I think?). So, to the extent I understand the intent of the question about checking list-faces-display, I don't think I'd actually get anywhere there unless there's some way to selectively enable faces on property checks or other shenanigans.

What's the best way to make sure that when I'm working on project X the appropriate style is set?  I don't want to have to always remember to call c-set-style when I change projects.

[15:08:03] <jmd> So I have in ~/.dir-locals.el the line (("/home/jmd/xxx" . ((c-indentation-style . "foo"))))  Yet when I visit /home/jmd/xxx/main.c the value of c-indentation-style is "gnu"  - Have I misunderstood something?

[21:31:13] <j0ni> fnstudio_: you can experiment with using minibuffer completion for code completion - it can actually work quite well in some contexts I have found

[21:32:42] <j0ni> corwin: for example, let's say you are using a mongodb driver dependency (don't laugh, this is javascript), and the driver dependency has its own dependency on some network abstraction code
[21:33:08] <j0ni> then imagine that you also use an HTTP implementation which itself references a different version of that first thing

[21:33:47] <j0ni> when you ask your mongo for something, you get back something with an embedded datastructure or object
[21:34:04] <j0ni> and you pass it to your reach-out-and-touch HTTP function
[21:34:12] <j0ni> that's what I'm talking about
[21:34:27] <j0ni> it *seems* to solve the classpath problem (cf java)
[21:34:33] <corwin> j0ni: gotcha.  that's a great 'splanation. much appreciated.
[21:34:37] <j0ni> but it just makes it a little bit harder to debug
[21:35:33] <corwin> so what I take from this is don't screw around with antiquatted stuff like databases when you are writing JS /s
[21:35:46] <j0ni> sadly this is a problem without a good solution - other than doing something like TCP/IP, which means you're stuck with what you decided 40 years ago
[21:36:23] <j0ni> and I guess be diligent in verifying the code you're actually shipping, even (especially) if it isn't yours
[21:36:26] <corwin> as an emacs user being stuck with my choices from decades past is something of way of life

[23:29:24] <fengshaun_> tramp hangs when I try to connect to a remote host. I set debug-on-signal and debug-on-error to t, but I get way too many signals that interfere. How do I limit signals only coming from tramp-related functions to enter debugger?
