[02:40:30] <entuland> okay, so your end goal is using an external service to find out about your own home-hosted server's IP address so that you can communicate it to some client by some other mean so that they can connect to... your minecraft world or something?
[02:45:19] <rannnn8888> entuland No you still did not understand me, I try to understand with the request is sent directly from the client to the API address and back to it, or it is sent from my server and it forwards me to the client

[02:46:53] <entuland> if your server serves an HTML page that contains some jQuery and that jQuery is run on the _client_ (that is, the computer "seeing" your HTML page), and if that jQuery communicates with the website my-ip.io, then the result of that request would be the IP address of the client computer, not the IP address of your server

[02:51:50] <entuland> I'm not expert in such things, there is a chance that the browser on the client will send the URL of your website as referrer to my-ip.io
[02:55:10] <entuland> by the way, if all you want is giving _your_ users the ability to see their own IP address, that's an information you already have for the simple fact that they are communicating with your server
[02:55:16] <entuland> so you don't need my-ip.io at all
[02:56:01] <entuland> if you picked my-ip.io as a dummy example and you actually want to "leverage" on any other service trying to hide this from them, don't
[02:56:26] <entuland> check their usage terms and see if you can reuse their service and how you're supposed to do that
[02:56:36] <entuland> so that you can do that without trying to "hide" yourself from them
[02:56:43] <entuland> if you're not allowed doing it, simply don't do it
[02:58:35] <rannnn8888> No script I'm building is not related to this specific site I just built it to check,
[02:58:36] <rannnn8888> I want to use the API address of some site, and I wanted to know if this site can know that I am through my site: D
[02:58:36] <rannnn8888> So there is no way to know?
[02:58:59] <entuland> please read above
[02:59:05] <entuland> you shouldn't worry about that at all
[02:59:11] <entuland> and you should assume they'd get to know
[02:59:24] <entuland> so either you are allowed and you shouldn't care about them knowing or not
[02:59:36] <entuland> or you're not allowed and you shouldn't be doing that, simple as that

[08:42:55] <wroathe> Hrm, after reviewing React Testing Library I've got the distinct impression that it would be redundant in the scenario where I'm also doing end to end testing with the devtools protocol (via Puppeteer or Playwright) or WebDriver

[08:45:13] <wroathe> In general you might need more advanced testing scenarios, but with this functional example app I've been working with all of my components are pure anyway, and so simply rendering the component and asserting that it's got the DOM structure and content I expect, and then testing the event handlers separately should suffice. Testing with RTL would just be me testing that their understanding of the way
[08:45:19] <wroathe> that browsers trigger events is correct, and that I've correctly bound my handlers to the right nodes
[08:45:49] <wroathe> I'm curious what others experience with RTL has been like

[08:50:34] <wroathe> Also, the redundancy thing is important, because in my experience maintaining tests is a burden on large projects. It's best not to have two different kinds of tests testing the same thing, and to prefer one over the other if it's better.

[11:21:17] <makara> hi. I've got a webui project that depends on jquery. I don't want to commit the jquery files to my repo. At build time I use gulp to minify the project's assets. Can I import jquery at that time?
[11:21:37] <ljharb> makara: you shouldn't have anything vendored. npm install it.
[11:27:11] <makara> ljharb: and commit the node_modules directory?
[11:27:16] *** Parts: Lindrian (~Lindrian@about/regex/lindrian) (Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[11:29:32] <makara> these need to be packaged into a wwwroot directory in a JAR for deployment. I don't have the option of running npm etc in production environment

[11:32:59] <ljharb> makara: never commit third party code or built artifacts
[11:33:18] <ljharb> makara: that’s all fine, you can jar or tarball up whatever you want, that’s not committing
[11:34:40] <makara> ljharb: so I should get gulp to yank it out of node_modules?

[12:09:54] <makara> I was reading this https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/jquery-remove-modules/ and I wonder isn't there a way to get gulp to remove unused js without me having to tell it what js is not unused? Since its parsing the whole project and all...
