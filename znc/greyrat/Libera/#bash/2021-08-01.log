[10:25:16] <loganlee> hi guys https://termbin.com/vo6a if i run this script copying of files and umounting are *out of sync*. copying and umounting are not done in the correct order. thx!
[10:27:21] <loganlee> umounting says 'device is busy'
[10:28:23] <loganlee> i need to do umount command multiple times to umount all of them after the script finishes

[17:37:48] <kurahaupo> If by chance foo is already exported, it might be hard to see the difference
[17:38:12] <ormaaj> the former might be a bit faster depending on details. If it forks then runs the export command in the subshell before rather than directly creating envp  for execve
[17:38:48] <kurahaupo> In the earliest shells, "export" did not accept assignments as parameters, only variable names.
[17:39:31] <kurahaupo> ormaaj: there's a fork either way, so the difference is going to be hard to measure
[17:40:36] <ormaaj> in fact it probably does posix_spawn for the former. The latter must fork to run export first
[17:41:15] <ormaaj> (unless it handles the exact case of export followed by exec specially)

[17:48:54] <kurahaupo> also, why are you using #!…env for a scratch program on your own computer?
[17:49:01] <kurahaupo> !#!2
[17:49:02] <greybot> A script must start with a #! and the full path to its interpreter. This is usually called the hashbang or shebang line. This tells the kernel what program to run your script with. Unless you are publishing your script, just use the direct path to bash on your host, eg #!/bin/bash but if you want to make a demonstration script to publish, see !#! instead.
[17:51:03] <rendar> kurahaupo: i always use `#!/usr/bin/env python3` as shebang for my python programs
[17:51:26] <rendar> is that wrong?
[17:52:20] <kurahaupo> The #! line should be fixed to the path of the interpreter as soon as practicable; using env is a hack for when you don't know it.

[17:54:44] <kurahaupo> env means it depends on the user's PATH. That's an unnecessary security risk for "installed" programs
[17:55:17] <kurahaupo> A tiny risk I'll grant you, but let's not make it the default
[17:57:10] <rendar> kurahaupo: i see, you mean that it will search the command using the user's PATH which is calling the program itself, and not the wide PATH, e.g. of the root user
[17:57:13] <kurahaupo> The security risk is that it opens an extra hole though ONE of the security layers, which on its own can't grant access, but that might be enough for a multi-factor attack to succeed

[20:03:20] <yogoyo> somebody helped me to write this little wrapping helper https://gist.github.com/yogoyo/f8b886807d9f7955835341af2976a2b9 and i would like to ask, if somebody could translate 2 aspects to plain english
[20:03:42] <yogoyo> for example line 2: ${f##*/}
[20:03:45] <yogoyo> what does this do?
[20:03:55] <geirha> !basename
[20:03:56] <greybot> basename(1) can strip the directory and extension from a path (dir/subdir/file.ext -> file.ext or file). A parameter expansion can do it cleaner and *much* faster: "${path##*/}", "${path%.*}", at the cost of missing edge cases like path=/ or path=/path/to/dir/
[20:04:53] <geirha> PAGER='less +/Parameter.Expansion' man bash
[20:04:55] <yogoyo> parameter expansion
[20:05:01] <wwilliam> !pe
[20:05:02] <greybot> Parameter Expansion expands parameters: "$foo", "$1". You can use it to perform string or array operations: "${file%.mp3}", "${0##*/}", "${files[@]: -4}". They should *always* be quoted. See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 and "Parameter Expansion" in man bash. Also see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe.
