[20:54:49] <indomitable> biberu, are you convincing your work to buy you one of those new macs with notches in them
[21:16:26] *** Quits: kuribas (~user@ptr-25vy0i72e2u2h548zvl.18120a2.ip6.access.telenet.be) (Quit: ERC (IRC client for Emacs 26.3))
[21:26:54] <biberu> indomitable: we can pick what we prefer already
[21:27:14] <indomitable> i mean since there are new ones
[21:27:34] <indomitable> somehow i doubt you have the policy of "new laptop whenever you want"
[21:27:39] <indomitable> general consultancy policy is every 2 years
[21:29:09] <biberu> sure, not whenever, but no one had opinions on what i use
[21:29:19] <indomitable> why would they
[21:29:36] <biberu> indeed
[21:31:29] <biberu> ah, now I read what you actually said :>
[21:31:49] <biberu> and nah, not going for that
[21:32:04] <indomitable> feel like you get a really good laptop for at least 2/3rds of the price
[21:32:14] <indomitable> and without the stupid mac nonsense that comes with it
[21:32:36] <indomitable> when i was consulting my laptop was something like 300-400 euros, but today i'd manage fine with a 150-200 euro one
[21:33:04] <biberu> yeah, i don't see the point when i'm not interested in that ecosystem
[21:34:56] <indomitable> yeah i guess i see the point if you're making apps for iphones, doing huge mixing things in apple-"run" video or audio editing setups...
[21:35:01] <indomitable> but for anything else it's dumb
[21:35:25] <indomitable> they have nice screens, i'll grant them that. but now they put a notch in them
[21:35:33] <biberu> I'm also not buying new just because it exists, that's just more waste
[21:35:39] <indomitable> same
[21:35:42] <indomitable> i'm fighting the urge atm to buy something new
[21:35:54] <indomitable> I have absolutely no need for it. And I have the liquidity to buy something outright
[21:36:04] <indomitable> I *WANT* new shiny stuff. But I shouldn't. I don't need it.
[21:36:16] <indomitable> It's a daily struggle, I'm telling you.
[21:38:10] <biberu> xD
[21:39:00] <indomitable> biberu, i'm eyeing things with more ram, since my craptop has very little of it. but... i could just install arch linux on it given what i actually use it for. :-/
[21:39:20] <indomitable> I also have another laptop spare that I just don't use, because I don't like it, that has plenty of ram.
[21:40:48] <biberu> download more ram?
[21:48:22] <indomitable> no
[21:48:23] <indomitable> I refoos
[23:19:18] <indomitable> biberu, omg, you're slow!

[23:19:26] <indomitable> it's been out for maybe HOURS
[23:35:14] <biberu> indomitable: nice!
[23:35:29] <biberu> we had story time here
[23:35:46] <biberu> apparently the world doesn't stop meanwhile
