[17:53:25] <FromGitter> <AreTaro> Hello, I'm a beginner. I don't know if it is the right place for this question, so please do not hesitate to tell me.  ‚èé  ‚èé I'm trying to add `(global-set-key [(meta up)] 'org-move-subtree-up)` in the /.spacemacs/ file, but it looks like `meta up` is already used to move frame up. So I have two questions: ‚èé  ‚èé 1) do you know in which file all binding keys are set up? ...

[18:32:33] <FromGitter> <kjartan_oli:matrix.org> If you do not use the current keybinding, then overriding it with what you want should be perfectly fine.
[19:05:35] *** Joins: baldlizard (~Thunderbi@p57985d31.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[19:27:50] <FromGitter> <AreTaro> it didn't work. So I used `C-<` and `C->` instead, but I still didn't find the file which contains the all the setup for binding keys.
[19:40:14] <FromGitter> <kjartan_oli:matrix.org> To my knowledge there is no single file with all keybinding setup.  But I just realised that any org-mode related keybindings are probably set by org-mode in `org-mode-map` which is more specific than the global map.  That's probably why it didn't work.  Try this one: ‚èé  ‚èé ```(bind-key [(meta up)] 'org-move-subtree-up 'org-mode-map)``` [https://gitter.im/sy
