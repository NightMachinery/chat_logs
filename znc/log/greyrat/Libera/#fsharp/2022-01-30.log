[00:47:50] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Release schedules like this scare me: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Be5SSE4M/image.png
[00:47:53] <MatthiasVance> This is Fable.Elmish
[00:50:59] <biberu> yeah, odd, infrequent bursts of activity
[00:53:41] <MatthiasVance> So you pick either a JS transpiler (Fable or WebSharper .. which is from the same people??) or WebAssembly (Bolero or maybe others)
[00:55:07] <biberu> how is dom interaction from wasm?
[00:56:00] <MatthiasVance> Well apparently F# has no tree shaking? So that would be bad to load in the browser 10-20MB
[00:56:23] <biberu> ouch
[00:57:20] <MatthiasVance> So I think Fable is the way to go
[00:57:24] <MatthiasVance> And Elmish is the purest form of that
[00:59:03] <biberu> is this something you're doing for fun, or that you'll possibly need (other people) to maintain for a long time?
[01:01:41] <MatthiasVance> biberu: That's hard :P If I needed something to be maintained for a long time F# might not be a logical choice for the frontend
[01:03:33] <biberu> did you consider ts with fp-ts if so?
[01:13:29] <biberu> MatthiasVance: making it easier? ^^
[01:21:32] <MatthiasVance> biberu: I'm also kind of experimenting with F# here, but in a way the frontend can be thrown away if I actually want to be more serious about it
[01:21:52] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Also, in case of Elmish there might not be any new functionality required over a 1 year period.. if it works, it works
[01:21:56] <MatthiasVance> Is what I think
[01:34:04] <biberu> MatthiasVance: just had to play devil's advocate for a bit ;)
[01:34:51] <biberu> it is a pretty nice setup though, js leaks through ofc, but it's an interesting type system with a functional experience like that
[01:45:03] <MatthiasVance> biberu: Thanks for that, always appreciated :D

[14:50:40] <MatthiasVance> Bah everything Fable kind of uses outdated things that all give me warnings
[14:50:41] *** Joins: Deide (~deide@user/deide)
[14:50:49] <MatthiasVance> I really don't like being in the JS ecosystem xD
[14:51:06] <MatthiasVance> But at least you *could* use React components and interface with them quite nicely

[22:59:19] <MatthiasVance> biberu: I definitely want to avoid the whole JS ecosystem, so no Fable. I checked out Bolero: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Wn9jzvfS/image.png

[23:54:23] <biberu> :o
[23:54:57] <biberu> that's very cool
