[01:24:12] <winter> <bookworm> winter: just set the THELOUNGE_HOME and be done with it, don't see why you need to specify a path besides that? <-- that does not allow the usage of declaratively installed plugins
[01:24:18] <winter> *without insane hacks
[01:24:28] <winter> <bookworm> winter: your primary problem with "declarative" is that you need to patch the package.json file for every plugin... meaning you can't just drop a directory somewhere and that's enough, you need to add it to the file too, which is bad for package managers <-- that's desirable in our case
[01:25:11] <bookworm> what's desirable? That you need to add it to package.json? Highly doubtful
[01:25:30] <winter> That's not what I mean
[01:25:31] <winter> https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/ce6f6d70825aaf5e8793961b03c10da5f495dad2/nixos/modules/services/networking/thelounge.nix#L12
[01:25:39] <winter> The package.json is handled on the fly
[01:26:24] <winter> So you would just set `services.thelounge.plugins = [ pkgs.nodePackages.thelounge-theme-solarized ]`
[01:27:02] <bookworm> mkey, but why do you need a separate path for that?
[01:27:08] <bookworm> THELOUNGE_HOME will work just fine
[01:27:29] <bookworm> you are already relying on internals which you shouldn't be relying on so one more or less really doesn't matter
[01:28:26] <winter> It won't,  at least per my understanding.  We use systemd StateDirectory,  which apparently does not like any paths in the statedir to be r/o -- which includes our r/o bind mount into /packages
[01:28:51] <bookworm> having a R/O state dir is contradictory
[01:29:06] <bookworm> the whole point of a state dir is to keep state, meaning you need to write in there
[01:29:14] <bookworm> static assets don't go into the state dir
[01:29:48] <winter> the state dir isn't r/o -- the packages subdirectory is
[01:33:08] <winter> in nix's case i mean
[01:33:11] <winter> not in general

[01:56:07] *** Joins: piro (~piro@46.136.13.72)
[01:56:29] <bookworm> well, not at the moment no. We first need to split etc and var, then we can see what else we make configurable
[01:56:56] <bookworm> to be honest, nix does nix things, let's do the normal FSH first, then look what to do for the oddballs
[01:57:28] <winter> sounds good to me -- is there anything issue or something i can subscribe to to track that progress so i can start thinking about nix stuff when that lands?
[01:57:33] <bookworm> you want specifically to just have a config for the package.json for the plugins yes?
[01:57:37] <winter> nope
[01:57:46] <winter> i want to specify the packages directory itself
[01:58:19] <winter> (which has packages.json and packages)
[01:58:36] <bookworm> all the deps as well, yes. Whatever you can cram into a node_modules folder
[01:58:53] <winter> right,  yeah
[01:58:58] <bookworm> we quite literally invoke yarn with that as the cwd
[01:59:13] <bookworm> and with that you get the usual js nonesense
[01:59:16] <winter> right
[01:59:22] <winter> that's why i'm doing what i'm doing for nix
[01:59:42] <winter> i can generate the package.json based on what the user wants and symlink the packages in
[01:59:44] <winter> and it works well
[02:00:00] <winter> but the issue is that it's in the state directory
[02:00:00] <winter> originally i was bind mounting it but systemd hates that
[02:00:38] <bookworm> for the time being that's probably also where it will stay... as config certainly isn't the proper place either but it needs to be writable by the TL user
[02:00:45] <bookworm> (for the normal case)
[02:00:49] <winter> right.
[02:01:08] <winter> and i don't wanna patch the binary either (I shiver at the thought of patching nodejs packages in Nix)
[02:01:12] <winter> *package
[02:01:13] <bookworm> while I would very much prefer a package manager first approach we have too many platforms / installation methods for that
[02:01:19] <winter> right

[02:01:52] <bookworm> well, not sure

[02:04:46] <winter> got it
[02:04:46] <bookworm> we use THELOUNGE_HOME but also whatever is patched into our magic file .thelounge_home
[02:04:46] <winter> oh god
[02:04:46] <bookworm> well it does make sense in a way, you can monkey patch the default at packaging time
[02:04:46] <bookworm> and override via env vars locally, so far not too bad
[02:04:46] <bookworm> we essentially need a (non breaking) way to bootstrap the various FSH dirs based on TL_HOME and go from there

[02:05:02] <winter> going to see if we can figure out something for Nix on the short term but I'll definitely subscribe to that issue for the future
[02:05:13] <fnutt> I assume this is a special case since most are happy how it works now. 
[02:05:13] <winter> thank you!
[02:06:12] <bookworm> considering that the optio won't be user facing but in the admin config we can probably get away with a toggle, I just want to do the easy stuff first if possible
[02:06:12] <bookworm> fnutt: most aren't happy now no
[02:06:12] <bookworm> including me
[02:06:12] <fnutt> Not seen many describing this sort of issue inthe channel before. 
[02:06:12] <bookworm> or anyone else with a distro package
[02:06:19] <bookworm> often actually, well at least with "why the hell do I have logs in /etc"
[02:06:22] *** control-z1 is now known as control-z
[02:06:30] <bookworm> and why the fuck are they world readable too
[02:06:40] <fnutt> Who cares?!

[02:07:13] <winter> <bookworm> often actually, well at least with "why the hell do I have logs in /etc" <-- o.O
[02:07:20] <fnutt> Spend time on stuff that many will find useful, including those that are users of TL. 
[02:07:24] <winter> that's very cursed
[02:07:27] <bookworm> yes
[02:07:28] <fnutt> That is my suggestion. 
[02:07:37] <bookworm> those things are useful
[02:07:40] <winter> well we don't want hacky,  non-conforming internals either
[02:07:42] <winter> yeah
[02:07:51] <bookworm> and I'm gonna spend time on things *I* care about, not what you care about fnutt 
[02:07:52] <winter> not everything non user facing isn't useful
[02:08:04] <winter> nice double negative,  me
[02:09:09] <fnutt> To me, splitting up TL into several folders will make it more difficult. Just saying. Having things together actually helps. 
[02:09:32] <fnutt> Then I don’t have to look into a lot of random folders to find stuff. 
[02:09:34] <bookworm> for you nothing will change unless you use the distro packages. And if you do that you should have a higher standard
[02:09:43] *** Quits: piro (~piro@46.136.13.72) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[02:09:48] <bookworm> there's a reason why things are in specific well known directories
[02:09:59] <fnutt> Not everyone knows what are usually found in those weird named folders in Linux. 
[02:10:10] <bookworm> yeah, but let's not cater to those
[02:10:14] <fnutt> Known to who? Those Linux geeks?
[02:10:22] <bookworm> fnutt: literally `man hier`
[02:10:39] <bookworm> that's how the whole system is setup
[02:10:47] <fnutt> It just isn’t as black-and-white as you are making it look like. 😊
[02:10:52] <bookworm> it really is
[02:10:59] <winter> yes it is tbh
[02:11:30] <bookworm> you expect things in windows to go to %APPDATA% and what have you, those things are called /var/lib and /etc and so forth on unix systems
[02:11:35] <fnutt> Different opinions. 
[02:12:05] <fnutt> Try telling that guest earlier in this channel that TL is going to be spitted around the whole hdd.

[02:12:15] <fnutt> And see his/her reaction. 
[02:12:16] <bookworm> they wouldn't care
[02:12:28] <bookworm> all they'd interact with is /etc/thelounge/config.js same as now
[02:12:32] <fnutt> If they are going to find logs, they will. 
[02:12:36] <bookworm> and thelounge add and thelounge install and such
[02:12:38] <fnutt> Or config files. 
[02:13:02] <bookworm> that's the point, those things have well known directories
[02:13:13] <bookworm> every single Linux user will learn to look for them in specific places
[02:13:21] <fnutt> Again, well known for who?
[02:13:29] <bookworm> config goes to /etc, state goes to /var/lib, logs go to /var/log
[02:13:30] <winter> linux users
[02:13:33] <bookworm> ^
[02:13:34] <fnutt> Then I am not one of them. 
[02:13:48] <fnutt> Etc stands for?!?
[02:13:55] <winter> then this doesn't concern you really,  your use case won't be affected
[02:13:59] <fnutt> var? What?!
[02:14:11] <winter> *var*iable state
[02:14:18] <fnutt> It will, since I am both accessibg logs and config files.

[02:15:41] <bookworm> if you use a OS you need to familiarize yourself with it
[02:15:41] <bookworm> yes, that includes a learning curve
[02:15:41] <bookworm> the magic thing there is to follow the usual practices rather than re-inventing the wheel so that every single time you learn something it's applicable to *everything else*
[02:15:41] <bookworm> same as we also use systemd, is it intuitive? God no, still the "normal" way of doing things so we do use things like sysusers.d and tempfiles.d and unit files \
[02:16:07] <fnutt> Good night
[02:16:45] <bookworm> your theme has no impact on that, people will still use thelounge install $theme no matter where we store it

[10:15:51] <sbeex> Hi guys, I discovered the lounge docker image and seems to be exactly what I was looking for ! but everytime I reopen the page I have to reselect my irc channels and I am no longer connected to them
[10:16:02] <sbeex> is there a way to preconfigure it somehow ?
[10:16:09] <sbeex> thank you
[10:16:51] <dvanloon> You'll need to edit the config and change it to private mode
[10:17:15] <dvanloon> At that point you'll need to use the CLI to add a user
