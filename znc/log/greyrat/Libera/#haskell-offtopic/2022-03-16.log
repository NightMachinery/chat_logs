[17:02:32] <dminuoso> Im writing some tooling to bootstrap a linux iso from. What language offers me minimal effort "grab some input from the user, and parse it it according to simplistic rules"?
[17:02:42] <dminuoso> i.e. I want to ask for a number, and that number must satisfy some predicate
[17:02:47] <dminuoso> stuff along these lines
[17:05:13] <kuribas> bash?
[17:05:50] <dminuoso> Not sure bash is the most pleasent experience of processing and validating user inputs, building a small wizard with
[17:06:14] <kuribas> yeah, not really, but it is pretty much everywhere.
[17:06:17] <kuribas> otherwise Python.
[17:06:32] <kuribas> I think python is everywhere as well now.
[17:09:07] <geekosaur> agreed

[19:48:30] <tdammers> I think the classic choice would have been Perl, but, well...
[19:49:02] <geekosaur> I'd probably write it in perl but then I'm an olde phart™
[19:49:21] <tdammers> I'm an olde phart too, and still kind of dislike perl
[19:49:54] <tdammers> we used to have a bunch of server provisioning scripts, all written in perl, at one of my many previous jobs, and I hated every second of working on those
[19:50:13] <janus> now we have yaml instead of perl, way better ;)

[20:25:10] <Sqaure> Man, i cannot overstate how much I love Haskell. I want it (or something very similar) to succeed. The sheer thought of having to go back to simplistic imperative languages is depressing. 
[20:25:52] <Sqaure> But how is it doing? Are things moving in the right direction or is it losing momentum? 
[20:27:08] <Cale> It's doing well as far as actual usage is concerned, but the community has gotten a little bit quieter I think, because a lot of people have gotten hired at various places.
[20:27:37] <Sqaure> Great to hear.
[20:27:49] <kuribas> Sqaure: Succesful enough, there are plenty of jobs now.
[20:28:18] <monochrom> Some people are moving in the right direction. C#, Clojure, Scala...
[20:28:44] <Sqaure> monochrom, Downhill i hope? =D
[20:29:07] <monochrom> The scripting language arena is still being scripting languages though. But we'll see whether Julia and R will make a difference.
[20:29:34] <monochrom> No, C#, Clojure, Scala are slowly adopting FP idea.s
[20:29:46] <Sqaure> ah ok. 
[20:30:30] <Cale> The direction as far as the Haskell language itself is concerned is a little bit concerning to me. There have been a bunch of questionable GHC proposals approved that I worry are just complicating the language without getting much for it.
[20:30:32] <kuribas> monochrom: if your aim is not very ambitious.
[20:30:49] <kuribas> Cale: Dependent types?
[20:31:11] <Cale> Moreso the stuff dealing with records, linear Haskell...
[20:31:36] <kuribas> I kind of like the new record stuff.
[20:31:51] <kuribas> records in base haskell are quite rigid.
[20:32:13] <Cale> Dependent types stuff is also a little spooky just because it demands a lot of taste and self-control of developers, but it also stands to unify/simplify a lot of the mess that is our existing pile of extensions.
[20:32:28] <Cale> RecordDotSyntax is awful
[20:32:39] <Sqaure> I feel this is a bit concerning https://well-typed.com/blog/2021/08/large-records/
[20:33:38] <monochrom> Programmers do lack self-control, yeah. :)
[20:34:27] <Sqaure> ..or i mean, that theres an issue with large records that doesn't have a solution in GHC yet. I had a usecase where that is relevant.  
[20:35:08] <Cale> Sqaure: Nobody typically defines record types that large without breaking them into smaller, better-organized parts
[20:35:41] <monochrom> But perhaps some bots do.
[20:36:19] <Cale> Yeah, if you're autogenerating code from API specs, you might run into something that you need to worry about every now and then.
[20:36:50] <Cale> Also, it's frequently the case that when your records get that big, you have mostly-optional fields, and something like DMap is more convenient anyway.
[20:37:23] <Sqaure> I know. But yeah. I still had a use case where that was a thing. An outlier maybe, but having to tell users of the library to "remember to make small records to not bounce into the compiler limitations" felt a little sad.
[20:39:29] <monochrom> Don't worry. The GNU linker also takes quadratic time. >:)
[20:39:47] <geekosaur> and memory iirc
[20:40:19] <Sqaure> (it was a datacollection system for healthcare where forms of 300 variables was not uncommon)
[20:40:24] <Cale> DMap handles a lot of the cases that I would usually want extensible records for -- technically weaker compile-time guarantees than a true extensible record system, but often better positioned for the actual stuff I care about.
[20:40:42] <Cale> Sqaure: Yeah, that kind of thing is a use case for DMap
[20:40:59] <Sqaure> oh ok. Ill look into that
[20:41:36] <Cale> You basically build a GADT whose values are your "field names", and they're type-indexed by the type of the corresponding field.

[20:42:18] <Sqaure> gotcha. Yeah, sounds promising
[20:42:39] <Cale> and then DMap lets you have maps from those keys to values of the appropriate types (or you can also apply any type level function to the type of the fields if you want)
[20:45:27] <Cale> When you have a huge number of fields like that (in our case it was with respect to an application dealing with mortgage related forms where there were thousands of potential fields), you can start building up the field names in a systematic way, with constructors that effectively "include" other GADTs you've already defined, like you might have a GADT for the fields of a street address, and then you could 
[20:45:28] <Cale> have HomeAddress and WorkAddress constructors that take one of those as an argument
[20:45:50] <Cale> It actually becomes nice that they're not just arbitrary string identifiers then
