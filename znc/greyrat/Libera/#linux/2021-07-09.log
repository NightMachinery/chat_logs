[01:09:25] <kurahaupo> Tashtari: There are two kinds of I/O devices in Linux: "fast" and "slow". A process waiting on slow I/O (typically a serial line or pipe or socket) can be woken early, aborting the kernel call with errno==EINTR, but a process waiting on fast I/O (typically any mounted filesystem except NFS-soft) cannot be woken. And signals can only be acted on by awake processes; they don't have any effect while processes are waiting on a kernel call

[01:11:13] <c705> why? because i have two of the same device, and the fact they share the same ID makes configuration somewhat annoying
[01:11:16] <kurahaupo> The only time people notice the difference is with broken devices or corrupted filesystems,
[01:12:07] <Tashtari> kurahaupo: It does seem like it's one of those.  That's why I was thinking at first that there was something hanging the kernel driver when it tried to interpret the filesystem on the drive, and wondering if I could bypass that.
[01:12:16] <Tashtari> er, the partition table, not the filesystem
[01:14:04] <kurahaupo> Tashtari: The fact that fdisk -l hangs, yet the /dev/sdXN are created, is very peculiar, since the latter are derived from the same disk sector as what fdisk reads

[05:57:02] <Kyv> fling: are you the same one who wanted to know how to read archived pdfs
[05:57:11] <Psi-Jack> Sometimes, when you compress images that are already compressed, all you do is increase their size, not decrease. :)

[06:01:41] <fling> Psi-Jack: portage is a bunch of directories and small files, you can download in archive etc
[06:01:42] <Sauvin> And most image file formats don't lend themselves to useful decompression because they're already naturally compressed.
[06:01:55] <Psi-Jack> I mean, I betcha 100%, any rare image viewer you might find that does work within archive containers, has to extract said files before viewing them anyway.

[06:49:14] <bparker> one-liner
[06:49:20] <[[R]]> circuitbone: | is a pipe...
[06:49:31] *** Quits: Celeo_ (~Celeo@user/celeo) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:49:38] <spyroboy> I think you can argue that | is a command based on the fact that you're instructing your computer to pipe data from one program to another.
[06:49:41] <curdlesnoot> it's not. it's three "simple commands" that collectively form a "pipeline". the | is an intrinsic aspect of pipeline syntax, not a command in ints own right.
[06:49:42] <[[R]]> like mr green in the library with the lead pipe
[06:49:44] <circuitbone> its a command that performs an action like any other function
[06:49:47] <bparker> 'run' could even be amiguous here. maybe use 'type the following' instead.
[06:49:52] <akoana> well man bash(1) says  "A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators | or |&."
[06:49:53] <curdlesnoot> no it isn't.
[06:49:53] <bparker> ambiguous*
[06:49:54] <Psi-Jack> | is a function.
[06:49:55] <[[R]]> spyroboy: no
[06:50:09] * circuitbone moves away from the clowncar
[06:50:09] <spyroboy> what I can see here is that there's a huge conflation of programs and commands but commands are not programs.
[06:50:11] <Nosrep> he way i think about it
[06:50:12] <curdlesnoot> the | is merely pipeline syntax.
[06:50:18] <kfrench> mv green /lib | grep guilty
[06:50:19] <Nosrep> even if it's multiple commands joined with pipes
[06:50:20] <bparker> akoana: pipeline is not a well understood term for that
[06:50:28] <Nosrep> it still functions as a single commadn
[06:50:30] <circuitbone> Its a command like any function, it has input and output.
[06:50:56] <Samian> see, this is why language frustrates me
[06:51:06] <spyroboy> the one thing I'd say about | being a command is that it's not a command if it's in a script. at that point it's a semantic element of your scripting language.

[06:51:09] <akoana> bparker: I didn't _write_ the manual, I just cited it, and ot sounds sane...
[06:51:15] <spyroboy> but if you're at the command prompt, it's all commands.
[06:51:16] <akoana> it*
[06:51:21] <spyroboy> hence, it prompts for a command.
[06:51:33] <Dagmar> It's io redirection.
[06:51:34] <bparker> especially for non-native English speakers, 'pipeline' may be quite gibberish to them
[06:51:46] <curdlesnoot> it's not a command in any shape or form. the documented grammar is very clear on this point.
[06:51:53] <circuitbone> functions do all sorts of things.
[06:52:08] <Dagmar> bparker: We didn't invent ASCII and include the pipe character just so other people could go calling it whatever thing they liked.

[07:19:51] <matsaman> that has been the norm for some time
[07:19:52] <curdlesnoot> Gustavo6046: stepping back for a moment, why would you be in a situation whereby you're trying to install a UEFI-aware bootloader while not having booted into UEFI mode? it would be somewhat unusual.
[07:20:02] <matsaman> lot of industry pressure to stop mobo makers from having that
[07:20:08] <curdlesnoot> Gustavo6046: or, in short, what are you trying to do?
[07:20:24] <Gustavo6046> curdlesnoot: I am booted into Manjaro Linux from BIOS
[07:20:35] <Gustavo6046> Or at least I believe it is BIOS because EFI variables are not supported in this system, according to efibootmgr.
[07:20:43] <Gustavo6046> and grub-install x86_64-efi
[07:20:51] <Gustavo6046> I want to use UEFI instead.
[07:20:55] <curdlesnoot> Gustavo6046: so, you're trying to switch an existing Linux install to using UEFI to boot?
[07:20:59] <Gustavo6046> It's apparently faster
[07:20:59] <curdlesnoot> ok, that makes sense.
[07:21:03] <Gustavo6046> Yeah
[07:21:08] <Gustavo6046> But I don't know if it is supported by this machine
[07:21:12] <Gustavo6046> I believe it is, but I dunno
[07:21:23] <curdlesnoot> Gustavo6046: if you even see "Legacy BIOS" as an option, it has to be.
[07:21:30] <matsaman> not rebooting is faster...
[07:21:34] <curdlesnoot> there'd be no need to choose "Legacy BIOS" where BIOS is all you have.
[07:21:55] <Gustavo6046> And if it is I want to *configure* my system to use UEFI, without rebooting; I will still be using BIOS until I reboot, but after the reboot I'll be on UEFI.
[07:22:01] <Gustavo6046> Ah.
[07:22:09] <curdlesnoot> Gustavo6046: anyway, you could try and fumble it using the method I mentioned. but you might really be better off booting from a live cd/usb in UEFI mode and then just doing the bootloader install from there.
[07:22:13] <Gustavo6046> Well I don't remember very well
[07:22:13] <matsaman> most likely after you reboot it won't work, because configuring UEFI is a PITA

[08:00:23] <Gustavo6046> Then I booted it in a VM. There I could boot into it using a regular Arch Linux installation live ISO (I know, not the most advisable since I earlier used Manjaro, but I don't think that is the issue, and I don't have a Manjaro ISO handy right now so).

[08:01:13] <Gustavo6046> (the one that grub-install made)
[08:01:28] <Gustavo6046> Then I realized.. that it was lacking initramfs, because Arch Linux generates it when it installs/updates Linux, but I didn't do it via pacman.

[08:13:21] <curdlesnoot> well, boots back to uefi usually isn't an outcome after the point that the kernel is successfully loaded unless two things hold: there's an oops, and the kernel was configured to insta-reboot upon oopsing. off-hand, it sounds as though the bootloader isn't being loaded successfully, let alone the kernel.

[10:07:09] <curdlesnoot> yes.
[10:07:33] <TomTheDragon> and swapon/swapoff or it'll just transparently work?
[10:08:01] <curdlesnoot> getting the max pool size right is another matter. you're already short on RAM but - at the same time - compressing pages in transcendental memory can reduce the amount of paging drastically.
[10:08:11] <TomTheDragon> (this way I can know whether my script needs to run at a particular time)
[10:08:19] <curdlesnoot> so you might need to experiment with that. anyway, way. it needs at least one active swap (even if it never touches it).

[10:39:59] <rindolf> "Eric S. Raymond and I have a hypothesis that Microsoft wishes to deprecate the original Microsoft Windows Internals, and gradually replace them with an open source reimplementation based on Linux. That is because optimising, refactoring, or otherwise enhancing them, have been made more and more discouraged due to the (possibly justified) policy to not break legacy 3rd-party applications (including many
[10:39:59] <rindolf> old ones or ones with no source available). Programmers and other software developers who wish to work on them, whether young, old, experienced, or inexperienced, are thus frustrated at the process' lack of flexibility and agility that they become unhappy, aggravated and complain. Other obstacles are the iffy legal status of the codebase, which prevents opensourcing it like .NET Core, and its reported
[10:40:00] <rindolf> lack of elegance."
[10:40:08] <Dr_Coke> iLinux-OS-User: that's a good way to look at it thanks lol

[12:40:33] <alguien> Hi. I have a bunch of subtitles. If you wanted to search them how would yo do it? grep -rn doesn’t work not because there is no index (the bunch is not that large) but because text is not continuous, even individual sentences are broken into multiple (timestamped) lines. How do I search that?

[16:46:19] <Psi-Jack> Atheros is second best, I'd say.
[16:46:25] <akik> good that we can agree on that
[16:46:43] <peetaur> ok....never actually had an intel one. Can you buy them in pcie and usb or only onboard or something?
[16:46:50] <Psi-Jack> At least Atheros you can use promiscuous mode if you need it in AP mode.
[16:47:09] <Psi-Jack> peetaur: Not on USB, but PCIe with mPCIe adapter yes.
[16:47:12] <peetaur> and I can believe Intel would be good; they also do network and video and other stuff right (comes fully functional in vanilla kernel!)

[16:49:06] <Psi-Jack> peetaur: You need promiscuous mode to use it as an access point.

[16:50:04] <Psi-Jack> Yeaahh... I didn't know they had done that, so when the TW broke big time, I just went back to Fedora.
[16:50:06] <Psi-Jack> Tried and true. :)
[16:50:21] <peetaur> it got so awful since then that the stability difference between arch and openSUSE tumbleweed is worse (in arch's favor) than between arch and debian

Only in the case where it is important that the application which is hampered can continue to write after the space is remove and before it is cleanly stopped, then it is a last resort to use a spacer. Better you do not need a spacer in the first place.

[20:40:27] <Haxxa> Hey Guys, I have a tough issue, which I don't even know where to start diagnosing, since upgrading to Debian Bullseye (Proxmox 7), I'm having nvme drives completely disappear from the system, at first I thought it was an APST firmware issue and I bought new SSDs, but after swapping them over I have found the issue persists. I have confirmed the

[23:54:06] <RedNifre> Okay, so I have a disk with an ext3 partition called "toosmall" connect to one of the three USB ports, how do I mount that?
[23:54:24] <lacroix> Cooking time.
[23:54:31] <RedNifre> (I only know mount /dev/yourluckyguess /where/you/want/it )

[23:54:45] <knocktwice> RedNifre: 'cat /proc/partitions' then plug the device in, then 'cat /proc/partitions' again, and spot the difference.
[23:54:58] <hexnewbie> RedNifre: If you really have a *partition* called "toosmall", that would be /dev/disk/by-partlabel/toosmall (you likely don't, though try /dev/disk/by-label/toosmall )

[23:55:07] <akik> RedNifre: lsblk -o +TRAN | grep -i usb
[23:55:35] <akik> RedNifre: that gives you the names of your usb disks
[23:56:23] <RedNifre> I don't have lsblk and probably won't get it, since I'm on an ancient SPARC based ReadyNAS Duo running some sort of Debian.

[23:58:38] <fakuve> how can a .git folder be 1 GB ? what is this? my computer is getting crazy? is anyone trying to punk me from somewhere?
[23:59:09] <Psi-Jack> fakuve: Large repository with lots of files? Binary files?
[23:59:17] <RedNifre> knocktwice: thanks, looking at the difference helped.
[23:59:22] <Psi-Jack> Lots of history even*
[23:59:24] <omero> or df -h, akik ?
[23:59:32] <RedNifre> uname -a gives Linux nas 2.6.17.14ReadyNAS #1 Wed Jun 20 20:08:20 PDT 2012 padre unknown
[23:59:35] <akik> omero: if it's not mounted then no
[23:59:37] <fakuve> Psi-Jack I havent commited it for quite long
[23:59:50] <Psi-Jack> Doesn't really say much.
