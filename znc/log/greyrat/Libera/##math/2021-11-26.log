[02:03:36] <d3x0r> https://d3x0r.github.io/STFRPhysics/math/mathSphereDecay  I like this :) slider 'offset X' controls how much space is displaced.  Offset Y is how far away you are ; basically controls the Z plane (starting at 0).  The inner curvature, which is just how much each point is displaced from its initial position forms this really neat projection of a rectangular map over a sphere
[02:04:22] <d3x0r> as you increase the offsetY (move away) the inner sphere closes .... if your offsetY is less than OffsetX, then there's a gap where there is no space in the center...
[02:04:51] <d3x0r> Turns out these curves are all the same as relativistic curves; but inverse hyperbolic... so they're the rectangular projections of curved paths
[02:06:01] <d3x0r> The inside looks a lot like the curves from rodrigues rotations... they're all closed loop too... sort of the inverse is a sqrt(-1) anyway so it sorta makes sense it would look a little like rotation space too

[03:50:07] <cherim> Let G be a finite graph. Orient its edges to get a DAG, let m be the length of the longest directed path in it. Then m can take any integer value between [the chromatic number of G] and [the length of the longest simple path in G]. How easy is this?

[04:43:42] <johnkeats6> ppw, the point is that the X_i - mu are independent and mean 0
[04:44:23] <ppw> uh, mean is certainly not zero
[04:44:36] <johnkeats6> X_i - mu certainly has mean 0
[04:46:34] <johnkeats6> (1/n sum x_i) - mu = 1/n sum (x_i - mu). so when you square you have 1/n^2 (sum x_i - mu)^2 = 1/n^2 sum_{i,j} (x_i - mu)(x_j - mu)
[04:46:51] <johnkeats6> when you take expectation, due to independence and mean 0 the i != j terms in the sum die
[04:47:13] <johnkeats6> you're left with only i = j terms which are sum (x_i - mu)^2
[04:49:03] <johnkeats6> it's easier to see this if you first prove the more basic fact that X, Y independent implies Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)

[04:58:13] <johnkeats6> in fact this is exactly the same phenomenon, in a different context.

[07:32:21] <d3x0r> https://i.ibb.co/JKHsQVk/image.png  So this inside curve looks a lot like the reimann zeta transform; at least the part around 0... would have to stretch it (stretched it some) more towards infinity is closer to zero.. but it's a minkowski orthonormal also instead of square (that's just a scaling factor I think?)  probably just a coincidence too(?)

[13:44:30] <cadmio> I've this exercise "Let G a group with pq elements, with p and q primes such that p < q. Prove that G has one and only one subgroup of order q. Prove in addition that if p does not divide q − 1, then G is cyclic."
[13:45:16] <cadmio> the 1st part seems easy, I reasoned like this: "Since n_q must divide p, we conclude that n_q = 1."

[13:59:37] <anovick> I have a question on Infinitesimal Calculus (II). Say I have a continuous function f in the domain [0,inf) and I know that limf(x)=0 as x->inf, is it necessarily the case that the improper integral of f(x) over [0,inf) converges?
[14:03:26] <anovick> oh I think this is false. for example f(x) = 1/(x+1) it is continuous over [0,inf) but lim(ln(x+1))=inf as x->inf when ln(x+1) is the integral of f(x).

I have a stiffness equation Kx = f, but x and f are known, and K is tridiagonal matrix whose components are made up of some variables (http://mathb.in/67844).

[19:18:46] <Z-module> Have a Sylow-related issue, cadmio ?
[19:19:21] <xet> joel135: hey thanks for idea, i'll try it out!
[19:19:26] <biberao> :\
[19:19:36] <cadmio> hey Z-module, I was working on this today "Let G a group with pq elements, with p and q primes such that p < q. Prove that G has one and only one subgroup of order q. Prove in addition that if p does not divide q − 1, then G is cyclic."
[19:19:53] <cadmio> I don't know apart the 1st part whether is Sylow related
[19:20:16] <cadmio> Since n_q must divide p, we conclude that n_q = 1; n_p = 1 by the same argument.
[19:20:31] <Z-module> It is, in the sense that G's q-Sylows all have order q, and all q-element subgroups here are q-Sylows. SHow that there is only one of those.
[19:21:00] <Z-module> n_q must be 1, yes.  n_p need not be.
[19:21:27] <Z-module> n_p could actually = q.
[19:21:30] <cadmio> why not?
[19:21:55] <Z-module> (that's the only possibility other than n_p = 1 ).  I'm only talking about the first part of the problem. here.
[19:22:19] <Z-module> n_p being q means q must = 1 (mod p)
[19:22:36] <Z-module> that is, p | (q - 1),  the thing ruled out in the second part of the problem
[19:23:12] <Z-module> Example: G = S_3, |G| = 2*3.  CHeck that n_2 here = 3.

[19:27:00] <Z-module> cadmio, right, in my S_3 example with p = 2, q = 3,  n_2 turns out to be 3, and 3 does = 1 mod 2, and 3 | 3  (q is 3)

[19:27:43] <biberao> joel135: its a good recipe
[19:27:53] <Z-module> n_2 = 3 because in S_3, the subgroups  {e, (1 2)}, {e, (1 3)}, {e, (2 3)}  are all the 2-Sylows.
[19:28:34] <cadmio> so n_p must divide q but q is prime so n_p = 1, isn't it?
[19:28:50] <Z-module> a prime is divisible by both 1 and itself
[19:29:00] <Z-module> "a divides b"  does not require a < b
[19:29:15] <Z-module>  b | b  is true for all natural numbers b
[19:29:54] <cadmio> ah right so it can also be n_p = p

[19:30:31] <cadmio> *it
[19:32:11] <Z-module> no, n_p can never be p since is p is never = 1 (mod p).  But n_p can be one of the larger prime factors of |G|.

[22:49:59] <Simplar> Even though I sound funny and basic, I did prove that {x} and {y} can't be zero
[22:50:18] <Simplar> More than that, I've proven {x}{y} must be a rational number

[22:51:07] <Simplar> That was my point too
[22:51:17] <riv> thats a good point

[22:53:06] <Simplar> So we can represent {x}{y} = m/n, where m < n, gcd(m,n)=1, m,n are in N.
[22:53:27] <Simplar> making the equality from the problem look like m[x][y] = 17n
[22:53:56] <Simplar> since gcd(m,n)=1, m is not divisible by n and vice versa
[22:54:15] <Simplar> so [x][y] must be divisible by n, and also [x][y] must be divisible by 17

[23:04:09] <Simplar> The problem limits us to *positive* real x and y
[23:04:37] <Simplar> [x] and [y] can't be zero and {x} and {y} can't be zero because [x]{x}[y]{y}=17, a nonzero product
[23:05:00] <Simplar> thus x > 0, y > 0, {x} > 0, {y} > 0
[23:06:15] <isekaijin> Let X be a Hausdorff space, and let Y be its one-point compactification. If X is locally compact, then Y is Hausdorff. But if X is not locally compact, then Y need not be Hausdorff.
[23:06:19] <isekaijin> My intuition for this comes from two examples. If X = Q (as a subspace of R), then the new point in Y “has to fill the holes in Q”, and thus cannot be separated from any point in Q. If X = R^N (with the product topology), then the standard basis opens of X are “too large”, so again the new point in Y cannot be separated from them.
[23:07:11] <isekaijin> Is there any way to understand this phenomenon that “unifies” these two examples?

[23:07:49] <greenbagels> compactness is black magic
[23:09:07] <Simplar> as {x} and {y} are both less than 1 by the definition of fraction part function
[23:09:08] <isekaijin> What I tried is this.
[23:09:10] <isekaijin> I guess in some sense the opens being “too large” is a topological property depending on the “size” of the neighborhoods of every point.
[23:09:24] <Simplar> {x}{y} can't be a natural number
[23:10:27] <isekaijin> For X = R, the opens are “rather small”, in the sense that they need not extend all the way to infinity. For some reason, the topology alone can notice this “not extending all the way to infinity”, maybe R being connected has something to do with it.
[23:10:54] <d3x0r> see - that sounds fun - that's what I was just doing - expanding the space around 0 and now I have a space within 0 :)
[23:11:01] <isekaijin> But, for X = Q, we have lots of weird homeomorphisms X -> X that could not be possible for X = R, so now the topology alone cannot characterize the sets that “do not go all the way to infinity”.
