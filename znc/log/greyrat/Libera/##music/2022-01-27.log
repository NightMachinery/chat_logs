[02:30:45] <artao> prolly like 1500usd or so tho

[02:31:29] <artao> economics says that should drive the prices down, but the makers have to be able to make a profit, and with their limited sales they have to charge more per unit

[18:54:41] <Panther> Because they thought there would be no more dogfights in the air. They were wrong.

[19:12:19] <Panther> That's kinda part of the definition of favorite.
[19:13:33] <morf> why does it has plural form then? 
[19:15:24] <Panther> Typically, that would refer to more than one class or type of thing. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense.
