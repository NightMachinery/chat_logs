[07:19:25] <mcoffin> well if it's just down to that, then it really comes down to pricing on given products at the time
[07:20:14] <mcoffin> AMD has a slight lead in some areas in the CPU game, and their offerings tend to scale out to other applications better with the core count, but if you don't already have a GPU, then that might change things

[07:23:07] <mcoffin> archdemon: If you're planning on keeping the GPU, and that really is your workload, you would be fine with a 5600X I'd think. Good IPC, VERY low power draw, easy platform to build and work with. obviously I'm working off minimal information, but if you don't need the iGPU, then AMD has the better value proposition at that point right now
[07:23:30] <SponiX> thrice: you blink, and next thing you know you are trying to teach them to drive
[07:23:33] <archdemon> mcoffin: yeah thats what ive been told by a few people

[07:24:11] * mcoffin has WAAAY too many systems right now, so I have current experience (on linux even) on 3960X, 5900X, and 11700K as far as the CPU, and 6900XT, 5700XT, and 2070S on the GPU side

[07:25:58] <mcoffin> so, end of the day, if you don't need the iGPU, then AMD has a (sliiiightly) better value proposition and better scaling in other workloads

[08:09:22] <mcoffin> I mean, I have had pretty much 0 issues... I had a bit of an oof once because I was compiling my own LLVM packages for like a year, then ate a GCC+glibc upgrade, which made packages incompatible, but I couldn't launch gcc to build the one package I needed to get working again because it had an imcompatibility with the libgold binary from LLVM
[08:09:42] <mcoffin> that was the only time I oof'd myself and had to put the installtion media back in, just to build myself an LLVM package then I was g2g
[08:10:21] <kap> nice recovery
[08:10:29] <emberquill> Even with Arch it's generally pretty hard to seriously screw up to the point where you need the installation media to fix it, and even harder to screw up in a way that takes longer than a few minutes to fix.
[08:10:43] <emberquill> Unless you're deliberately doing something that other people will tell you not to do.
[08:11:02] <kap> Yeah I think I've only done it twice and I really deserved it haha
[08:11:12] <kap> it was on me
[08:11:21] <emberquill> I think the only time I needed the installation media was not even Arch's fault. It was because Windows update overwrote the bootloader and left me unable to reboot into Arch.

[08:13:20] <emberquill> Actually, it might just be because Windows is stubbornly refusing to install new feature updates for me now. So it's stuck like 3-4 updates behind which is why it hasn't broken systemd-boot again lol
[08:13:21] <mcoffin> but given how much of an arse windows was with that F32 partition, I'm not stoked on the upcoming EXT support in windows

[13:41:20] <frostwork> jmcantrell, ok, then I guess I missed the original problem somewhere.
[13:41:21] <rcf> jmcantrell: to avoid any ambiguity, place the prefix near the very start of the script under the shebang, so you could something like have INSTALL_PREFIX=/ on line 3, and then run something like sed -i "3c \INSTALL_PREFIX=$PREFIX" 
[13:41:58] <jmcantrell> i agree with rcf that it needs to be done at build time, so if there's a problem, it'll hopefully be visible at that point. also, it would mean that it's essentially hardcoded for its lifetime. also removes the need for 3 processes
[13:44:24] <rcf> Some people may prefer more versatility at runtime, of course; they are best served by allowing you to specify the configuration path as a command line option, or by an environment variable which will only be set to the hardcoded default if it is empty at runtime 
[13:45:45] <jmcantrell> rcf: what about `sed -i "/^INSTALL_PREFIX=/s/=.*/=$PREFIX/"` so it doesn't depend on the line number?
[13:46:44] <rcf> It's a trade-off based on whether or not INSTALL_PREFIX might show up anywhere else in the script, and whether you care about the resulting replacement. 
[13:47:21] <jmcantrell> rcf: yeah, i was leaning toward the latter suggestion, but i couldn't decide on /usr/local or /usr. i wanted to leave the possibility that i might write a PKGBUILD down the road
[13:47:46] <mion> there is always templating
[13:47:51] <jmcantrell> rcf: yeah, i see what you mean
[13:48:44] <jmcantrell> mion: that's kind of what we're talking about, just not as sophisticated
[13:48:56] <rcf> Ultimately it's your script and you can decide how best to to put that prefix in there. I take no responsibility for angry users!

[13:49:30] <mion> sed is not templating
[13:49:53] <jmcantrell> mion: right

[13:50:28] <mion> and just hand it over to make :)
[13:50:39] <jmcantrell> mion: i'd be curious to see how that's done
[13:51:39] <mpan> jmcantrell: simply define the macro from compiler’s command line, put its expansion in the file.

[13:53:01] <jmcantrell> as long as the tools are available in base-devel, i'd consider it
[13:54:27] <rcf> cpp can be run standalone (you probably want at least -P when doing this); then you can just use the same -DMACRO=value syntax that you'd be using to configure the C/C++ code you might already be using in the project. 
[13:54:30] <jmcantrell> it seems a bit overkill for one variable in one script :/
[13:54:41] <rcf> If it's just being used once I wouldn't bother. 
[13:55:35] <jmcantrell> i'm leaning toward defaulting it to /usr/local and overriding it in the dev env using direnv

[18:42:11] <Foxboron> oramirite: The package won't be rolled back, have you checked if systemd-stable has the patch backported?
[18:42:43] <niki> You can get a yubikey and use ed25519-sk with ssh keys, just make sure the server actually supports it first
[18:44:37] <aminvakil> i thought for a second there is a package in archlinux called systemd-stable :)
[18:44:42] <oramirite> Foxboron: is systemd-stable an arch thing? The fix is merged into the main branch of the systemd repo, but I realize that might not mean much.

[18:45:06] <aminvakil> i'm not sure, i think they mean https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable
[18:45:21] <Foxboron> oramirite: It's a systemd thing. It's a repository containg backports to systemd releases. The Arch package is the systemd release + the patches from systemd-stable applied
[18:45:44] <Foxboron> But I checked, the patch hasn't been backported so you need to open a bugreport on the systemd package in the repositories and request a backport
[18:45:58] <Foxboron> If it was included in systemd-stable it would just have been a simple package update

[20:20:46] <oramirite> I seem to be having some issues getting the nvidia driver to work. I'm trying to use nvidia-container-toolkit ultimately, but while troubleshooting I'm realizing that the driver doesn't even seem to be loading. Running 'lspci -nnk -d ,device ID>' only shows 'Kernel modules: nouveau' and I don't have any nvidia devices under /dev
[20:21:16] <oramirite> Admittedly I did do a bunch of VFIO hacks to get GPU passthrough on a VM working but I think I just undid all of those and am still having no luck

[21:58:28] <larch> Very strange behavior now.
[21:59:16] <larch> Disabling docker on start seemed to help me be able to log in, and then everything seemed to work for a minute, but then it hung again like something is blocking maybe name resolution or something.  Can't ping out, etc.

[22:40:02] <wizonesolutions> Bit of a long shot, but has anyone gotten the touch bar working with reduced functionality on Macbook14,3? I followed the steps from https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux and tried https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/macbook12-spi-driver-dkms/, but no joy. I still have the Apple firmware on my EFI partition (I reinstalled macOS), but that doesn't seem to be enough.
[22:40:03] <phrik> Title: AUR (en) - macbook12-spi-driver-dkms (at aur.archlinux.org)
[22:40:39] <wizonesolutions> It's not a huge deal since I'm going to use the install primarily for Home Assistant and can control it from other computers, but it'd be nice to get working.
