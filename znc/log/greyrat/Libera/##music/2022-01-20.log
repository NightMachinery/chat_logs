[06:42:01] <artao> including fishing under the umbrella word "hunting"
[06:42:08] <macrobat> maybe you could employ wolfpacks to do the deerhunting for you
[06:42:28] <artao> well, that's the idea
[06:42:39] <artao> wolves and cougar are supposed to keep the deer pop. balanced
[06:42:45] <macrobat> u say: "fetch", and they bring u a fresh kill

[06:55:47] <sdragon> Oof
[06:55:51] <efex__> Les Paul, or a Conde flamenco
[06:56:10] <sdragon> Depends on the usage, but I guess I'd just barely go with the strat
[06:57:03] <artao> gibson SG
[06:57:05] <artao> heh heh
[06:57:35] <sdragon> I wouldn't mind having a SG
[06:57:49] <artao> i just think they look cool
[06:57:56] <artao> and ultimately it all depends on the electronics
[06:58:26] <artao> strat is, in general, more of a "blues" guitar. tele is more "country"
[06:58:48] <sdragon> I'm more of a blues player
[06:59:11] <artao> i told my dad i've always wanted to have an SG bass, and he was like, "No you don't"
[06:59:12] <artao> lol
[06:59:21] <artao> poor sustain apparently. short scale bass

[07:00:42] <sdragon> Hendrix was known for playing strats, but he played SG, too
[07:00:55] <artao> indeed
[07:01:00] <artao> part of the reason i like em
[07:01:15] <artao> hooker played SGs
[07:01:35] <morf> hookers play something else
[07:02:47] <artao> and tele sometimes?
[07:03:04] <macrobat> tele is unergonomic. strat is better, even fits a beer belly. harsh highfreqs on tele
[07:03:30] <artao> wait wut? i am wrong
[07:03:32] <artao> les paul
[07:04:00] <macrobat> lp has the advantage of shorter scale, so it's easier to press the strings down
[07:04:05] <artao> no
[07:04:37] <artao> with bass?
[07:04:49] <artao> moreso that you don't have to stretch your fingers as far than how hard you have to press
[07:04:50] <macrobat> 24 inch scale is even better, like on my squier mustang. I don't need a whammy
[07:05:11] <sdragon> The first time I played a LP was also the first time I didn't have to look at the neck to move between strings
[07:05:28] <macrobat> it's like tuning a strat to Eb and putting a capo on the first fret

[07:07:19] <macrobat> with higher action, you also need the strings further apart? so you don't accidentally dampen the neighbour strings
[07:08:38] <artao> not sure. IDT so
[07:09:01] <artao> you have to adjust the intonation of each string, but the frets stay the same
[07:09:48] <artao> and then there scalloped fretboards, for speed guitar
[07:09:59] <artao> with super light action
[07:10:04] <macrobat> mustang is longer than it needs to. so much dead space behind the bridge. they should make a headless one
[07:10:19] <artao> headless guitars look so weird
[07:10:38] <sdragon> Headless guitars look so futuristic
[07:10:51] <macrobat> scallopping makes it easier to bend, the fingers don't drag the fretboard
[07:11:19] <macrobat> you could do the same with higher frets, I suppose
[07:12:04] <macrobat> .strandberg looks pretty neat
[07:15:45] <artao> wait .... Dexter killed the Trinity Killer didn't he?
[07:16:03] <macrobat> and why wouldn't you want a shortscale bass, spare your fingers and let electronics do the heavy lifting
[07:16:40] <sdragon> I want a bass guitar
