[05:13:25] <qrpnxz> what is even the point of linux mint over, say, Debian with MATE slapped on it?
[05:14:48] <Andrew> qrpnxz: User-friendliness for beginners: It uses the familiar Windows-looking Cinnamon desktop instead of MATE, it provides i.e. HexChat, file sharing, LibreOffice and a browser by default, etc
[05:14:59] <Andrew> It's meant for new users as far as I can see
[05:16:35] <qrpnxz> okay, so debian with cinnamon slapped on it then. GNOME meta package by default has mail client, libreoffice and such. idk about cinnamon package on debian, but it would be trivial to create such a package, and then what are you getting on top?

[06:50:58] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[06:52:02] <jacobk> isf: Yes! Haketilo has a script.
[06:52:17] <isf> how i can run that?
[06:52:21] <isf> :o
[06:54:52] <jacobk> There's 2 ways: The easy way is to intall the Haketilo extenstion, go to a song page (e.g. https://petscop.bandcamp.com/track/level1), and then click on the extneion icon and click "Install scripts for this page".
[06:55:58] <jacobk> The hard way is to go to a song page with a script blocker installed (e.g. NoScript) and then copy/paste the script from here (https://api-demo.hachette-hydrilla.org/content/sbandcamp/bandcamp.js) into the JavaScript console each time you want to play a song.
[06:56:50] <isf> where i can install the addon?
[06:57:08] <jacobk> https://hydrillabugs.koszko.org/projects/haketilo/wiki/Releases
[06:57:38] <jacobk> Unfortunately the latest beta is not signed by Mozilla, but 0.1 is and it works fine for Bandcampt at least.
[06:57:58] <isf> ooh ok
[06:58:56] <jacobk> I'm not sure if they've fixed it in newer versions, but Haketilo 0.1 breaks some pages with iframes, so if a page is broken you may need to uninstall Haketilo temporarily.
[06:59:09] <isf> works
[06:59:14] <isf> and for download it?
[06:59:22] <isf> are impossible yet?
[06:59:36] <jacobk> download what, the music?
[06:59:42] <jacobk> or the extensio
[06:59:44] <jacobk> n
[07:00:19] <isf> the music
[07:00:22] <jacobk> Once the music player shows up you can just right click and "Save Audio As...".
[07:00:29] <isf> oh thats true
[07:00:45] <isf> format: mpga
[07:00:51] <isf> :o i never see it
[07:02:20] <jacobk> I think it might just be renamed mp3? Admittedly I haven't actually tried to save any Bandcamp music permanently because I feel like I ought to buy it first.

[07:08:56] <qrpnxz> isf, yt-dl works with bandcamp i think
[07:12:06] <jacobk> TIL ^
[07:12:06] <jacobk> You can even download entire albums this way.
[07:12:46] <qrpnxz> yep, also soundcloud and several other sites. Good to know.
[07:12:56] <qrpnxz> TIL about haketilo so thanks :)
[07:18:13] <jacobk> By the way, if you find a site that doesn't work without nonfree JavaScript, writing free replacement JavaScript often isn't that difficult (obviously depends on the website a lot though) if you know how to program already. So, if you want to contribute, writing Haketilo fixes may be a good way to do that.
[07:18:58] <Andrew> jacobk: Most Websitese shouldn't use JavaScript in the first place.
[07:19:18] <Andrew> Technically one of my Websites, https://libre.andrewyu.org has JavaScript, but it serves a strange purpose.
[07:20:34] * jacobk manually copy/pastes your JavaScript into my console
[07:21:46] <jacobk> I agree it would be good if websites didn't use JavaScript, but writing free replacement JavaScript basically extends the browser so we don't need the website's JavaScript anymore.
[07:22:11] <Andrew> That's good from an ethical standpoint.
[07:22:28] <Andrew> But from a technical standpoint using JavaScript to make Web Applications ... meh bad idea.

[07:32:25] <jacobk> What does "All rights reserved" even mean these days? I see it in libre licenses sometimes.
[07:32:39] <qrpnxz> in libre licenses it's a lie
[07:32:45] <qrpnxz> otherwise it means all right reserved
[07:33:03] <DiffieHellman> jacobk: It means that all copyright restrictions are reserved (which is kind of automatic already).
[07:33:07] <White_Flame> No Lefts Unreserved
[07:33:09] <qrpnxz> copyright, patent, trademark et al.
[07:33:35] <DiffieHellman> It really should be limited to copyright.
[07:33:40] <DiffieHellman> It's not called patentright.
[07:33:49] <qrpnxz> some also didn't get the memo you don't have to copyright notice anymore to preserve your copyright
[07:34:02] <jacobk> What does "reserved" mean though? To me it sounds like keep, as in, we reserve the right to do xyz or whatever.
[07:34:13] <DiffieHellman> Yes, that's what it means.
[07:34:21] <qrpnxz> it means they didn't license them to you
[07:34:26] <White_Flame> DiffieHellman: well, it is an affirmation that just because you can see the source code doesn't imply any rights transfer to you, even of usage or whatevefr
[07:34:45] <DiffieHellman> White_Flame: Yep, but that isn't given by default reguarless.
[07:34:52] <White_Flame> right
[07:35:00] <DiffieHellman> *that is given
[07:35:43] <White_Flame> but back in the day, source code was more freely shared, so I think that reserved status wasn't necessarily what people thought by default
[07:35:54] <jacobk> So, an entity "reserving" a copyright would just mean they keep their copyright then, right? That seems compatible with libre licenses.
[07:36:18] <DiffieHellman> Back in the day, copyright didn't apply to software, so software could be shared freely/
[07:36:21] <qrpnxz> you can't say both licensed under gpl and all right reserved, that makes no sense
[07:36:33] <qrpnxz> gpl licenses some privilages, so they can't all be reserved
[07:36:44] <DiffieHellman> jacobk: Yes, but there's better wordings to use when it comes to saying that you hold your copyrights
[07:37:14] <qrpnxz> the standard wording is "Copyright [year] [name]"
[07:37:24] <DiffieHellman> Yup/
[07:37:27] <jacobk> If I say "I reserve the right to make copies of my work.", that doesn't imply that other cannot also make copies of my work, right?
[07:37:49] <qrpnxz> i guess you could argue not, but it's misleading
[07:38:42] <jacobk> Like if someone says, "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.", that doesn't mean no one else can refuse service to anyone obviously.
[07:39:06] <qrpnxz> because copyright deals with exclusive right to copy, so in the context of copyright that is a dubious superfluous statement
[07:39:25] <qrpnxz> i would avoid saying things like that

[07:40:46] <jacobk> isf: qrpnxz is correct though
[07:40:49] <jacobk> about TIL
[07:40:54] <qrpnxz> lol
[07:41:12] <DiffieHellman> jacobk: Generally when they use that phrase, they're affirming that the software is proprietary. Some people rarely like to use that phrase on software that's also licensed as free software/

[08:49:05] <isf> free software isnt about how the program works
[08:49:34] <isf> if the propietary software work better, that is the decoy of the trap
[08:49:56] <isf> so, if you value your freedom, you dont use that nonfree software
[08:50:40] <kompowiec2[x]> if it worked better, it probably would have been used, but it is there created by gnome programmers so it's hard to believe that it will be better
[08:51:40] <fossdev2> free software means freedom but KDE force people to use their own stuff and their ecosystem.
[08:51:49] <isf> At a deeper level, we must not present a nonfree program as a solution because that would grant it legitimacy. Nonfree software is a problem; to present it as a solution denies the existence of the problem.

[12:15:11] <leah> fsf glosses over EC btw. even though it's updateable, and even though it's even free on some machines
[12:15:20] <leah> (e.g. framework laptop, chromebooks, some system76 laptops)
[12:15:45] <leah> they only talk about what's running on host cpu
[12:16:05] <catt[m]> Yeah so EC cannot do much harm
[12:16:34] <catt[m]> It just controls some hardware functions and it doesnt have network access
[12:16:42] <leah> the secondary processor exemption, their glossing over of stuff like EC, and lack of effort to promote true free hardware (like sam zeloof's work, or the libre silicon project) means that they are dismissing levels of freedom we could actually have in the real world

[12:27:13] <catt[m]> I disagree with the fsf on that, but i do support their general cause
[12:27:49] <leah> i disagree with fsf dogma on how to get there. i'm interested in a more nuanced approach that brings in more people to the movement
[12:28:00] <leah> and, more crucially, more developers into the movement
[12:28:25] <leah> a smaller group within the group of new users you bring in, will go on to become developers themselves
[12:28:28] <catt[m]> They've grown the free software movement to a size where theres lots of people are actively trying to make freedom respecting alternatives to things
[12:28:32] <Andrew> <leah> PRAGMATISM!
[12:29:28] <Atr[m]> theres a myriad of complexities when you are working in a system that has 3rd party manufacturing facilities operating with trade secrets and proprietary technological profit models unless you are collaborating deeply within said organization or doing it yourself you are not going to get to that desired outcome
[12:29:35] <leah> did you know that windows programs were used to reverse engineer the intel flash descriptor on ich9m, leading to the discovery of the medisable bits in ifd now used for libreboot x200/t400 etc
[12:29:46] <leah> my ich9gen program was written based on that research

[12:30:33] <Andrew> rms used UNIX's cc to make gcc
[12:30:37] <Andrew> same thing
[12:30:42] <catt[m]> leah: I found the fsf after i used GNU/Linux on a home server around 1.5 years ago, then got arch working and installed on a second drive, then watched some channels that covered free software along with GNU/Linux
[12:30:47] <leah> well, since 2015. the info was written in 2014 but i published the work in late january of 2015
[12:31:48] <catt[m]> I think that with people finding GNU/Linux from the recent growth of it, some of those people will find tutorials for things they need help with from free software advocates and be introduced that way
[12:32:06] <leah> catt[m]: i've seen countless fsf-aligned people deride the coreboot project, because it has some blobs in it
[12:32:29] <catt[m]> Its a small amount of people but with more people trying to see how good GNU/Linux is for games or whatever else, that small amount increases
[12:32:35] <leah> i find this derision insulting. those people work hard to reverse engineer those blobs, and some of them are trying to get their companies they work for (including the vendors) to release sources
[12:32:44] <leah> they're working with what they have, and they have the same goals as us
[12:32:47] <leah> but they're the ones doing it
[12:32:55] <leah> and they get no support
[12:33:00] <leah> zero
[12:33:08] <Andrew> Deriding coreboot because of blobs is idiosyncratic
[12:33:22] <leah> they call openbsd non-free
[12:33:30] <Atr[m]> and the only way you will get support is if you have alot of money backing you
[12:33:38] <leah> openbsd has produced much of the software that we now depend on
[12:33:43] <leah> free software such as openssh
[12:33:45] <Atr[m]> boils down to the bottom line
[12:33:50] <leah> and, nowadays, libressl
[12:33:56] <catt[m]> Openbsd has a nice OS
[12:33:56] <catt[m]> Bad license but nice system
[12:34:07] <leah> there's nothing wrong with the isc license
[12:34:20] <catt[m]> im talking about the bsd license
[12:34:27] <Andrew> I prefer the GPLs, but ISC isn't really bad
[12:34:35] <leah> openbsd uses isc for new code contributions
[12:34:38] <Andrew> catt[m]: The OpenBSD license is ISC
[12:34:59] <Andrew> Let's fork the fsf
[12:35:37] <catt[m]> ISC is better than proprietary, obviously, but i think the GPL is better
[12:35:41] <leah> they originally used the 4-clause license
[12:35:44] <leah> now they use isc
[12:35:54] <catt[m]> OpenBSD is still great, just dont like the license personally
[12:36:04] <Andrew> The 4-clause license is theoretically nonfree
[12:36:18] <Andrew> Copyleft is an importnt part of my pragmatics
[12:36:37] <catt[m]> Helping corporations and letting them steal work from you without contributing anything
[12:36:44] <leah> i would regard openbsd as the most free os, because the code is very clean and easy to work with compared to most other big codebases. therefore, the practical ability to study and modify it and distribute improved versions is greatly increased
[12:37:03] <Andrew> leah: I mostly agree
[12:37:07] <Andrew> Until you consider Mezzano
[12:37:11] <leah> openbsd also has a much more stubborn policy about insisting upon access to hardware specifications, which they then use to write drivers
[12:37:21] <catt[m]> leah: Well, readability of the code does not define freedom
[12:37:23] <leah> a lot of other projects don't have as strict requirements
[12:37:27] <catt[m]> The code could be hard to read
[12:37:30] <catt[m]> Poorly written
[12:37:32] <leah> they want not just code to be free, but specs too
[12:37:36] <catt[m]> But its still free software
[12:37:37] <leah> datasheets and schematics, you name it
[12:37:53] <leah> their focus on hardware freedom is greater than that of fsf/gnu and linux
[12:38:08] <Atr[m]> what we need is a public manufacturing facility that is publicly owned and operated 
[12:38:23] <leah> catt[m]: if only 2 people on earth understand the code, then how can you say it's free
[12:38:46] <leah> there is a thing that i refer to as a "blob masquerading as source code"
[12:38:50] <kompowiec2[x]> EU should be interested especially during the war.
[12:38:59] <leah> i don't yet have a concrete, marketable term for this phenomenon
[12:39:04] <catt[m]> leah: Well, if its readable to them in it's public form then clearly nobody else read it
[12:39:40] <leah> kompowiec2[x]: in fact, the EU has a free software license that they wrote, and the fsf even lists it on their license page
[12:39:50] <catt[m]> If theres some sort of automated obfuscation of the code going on before it's published, then its proprietary
[12:40:05] <kompowiec2[x]> Cool!
[12:40:11] <leah> there's also a fund that was set up in germany to fund free software development
[12:40:38] <catt[m]> catt[m]: The source code that people get is not the same as the source code the distributors modify in that case
[12:40:41] <Atr[m]> good now we need a free hardware development facility paied with tax dollars
[12:40:43] <catt[m]> So i see it as proprietary

[12:42:08] <catt[m]> Atr[m]: I think the government dont really care

[12:42:52] <Atr[m]> that could be an internation movement
[12:43:12] <catt[m]> If there's a proprietary file encryptor app that is popular but it puts a backdoor in for the government to decrypt when they need to, then the government will support it
[12:43:14] <leah> in fact, the us government has expressed interest in running infrastructure on free software
[12:43:15] <Andrew> <catt[m]> The code could be hard to read, poorly written, but it's still free software 05Similarly, binary is hard to read, and might be poorly compiled, and is hard to write, but is that free software?
[12:43:16] <leah> cisa for instance

[12:44:06] <kompowiec2[x]> Andrew: and obfuscated code is free software?
[12:44:16] <catt[m]> But gov is not gonna support it, why should they
[12:44:20] <leah> historically, china has shipped a lot of products that actually contain free software, but they don't provide source code. nowadays, import regulations are going to start requiring that they list all software included in products
[12:44:33] <leah> and that means maybe we'll get some more source code actually released for products

[12:48:04] <catt[m]> The code can be hard to read and poorly written, on the condition that this is how the developers write it with no changes
[12:48:59] <catt[m]> An example of this is that if someone makes an operating system entirely in assembly, it is free software because it was written in the format you get it in

[12:52:02] <Andrew> makes sense
[12:52:53] <catt[m]> The problem with proprietary software disassembled is that it's so difficult to read the assembly at any scale to the point where it may as well be impossible because it was automatically generated from another language like C

[16:59:03] <fossdev2> yrk: sorry it was just a question.
[16:59:53] <yrk> fossdev2: that copyright notice tells you whom the license text was written by. why would you change that?
[17:00:35] <yrk> fossdev2: in fact, one would argue that you are not allowed to change, but here we see how deep this rabbit hole can get when you look at it uncritically
[17:01:16] <yrk> fossdev2: if you change that copyright notice, you are claiming to be the author and copyright holder of that text. did you write the expat/MIT license?

[19:27:14] <qrpnxz> FSDG means that completely free OS like Debian are not promoted as part of the freedom mission. Debian would be great to point to because it's strongly and widely supported, and accommodates users in different steps of the freedom ladder from "uses several non-free programs still" to "needs that one or two non-free programs still" to "needs a couple of non-free firmware to use his machine" to "completely free". Fedora has no non-free 
[19:27:14] <qrpnxz> general software in any repository, and aims for free software rather than DFSG (Open Source) (in fact, FSDG are based on Fedora guidelines), but they include some closed firmware. Given that non-free firmware is a direct consequence of non-free hardware, and that all those blobs run strictly in hardware that is not the CPU, this is also another OS that I think is good to recommend, but it is not FSDG compliant. Not that it's not 
[19:27:15] <qrpnxz> enough to be 100% free to be FSDG compliant, you have to publicly denounce non-free software, and be generally inconsiderate of it and users who need it or have not taken that step towards freedom yet.
[19:28:35] <qrpnxz> As far as SaaSS, if you do your computing yourself you don't let others control you that's about the gist of it. If you can do word processing on your machine, don't let Google do it for you. If you need compute, hire compute rather than send data to some black box you have no control over.
