[03:48:46] <x5c30> encrypted message is same length, yep
[03:48:59] <FlorianBad> ok, so kind of like zlib but without without having to flush ;)
[03:49:06] <aquanight> but I think that is typical of encryption (as opposed to hashing) ciphers
[03:49:08] <FlorianBad> and with same size
[03:49:34] <FlorianBad> yeah, it should be because so many use cases are just streaming
[03:50:03] <aquanight> generally speaking, pretty much every crypto algorithm supports streaming
[03:50:16] <aquanight> precisely because of this issue
[03:50:24] <FlorianBad> yeah, ok
[03:50:27] <aquanight> nobody casually has 400 GB of RAM lying around
[03:51:27] <FlorianBad> aquanight: I'm writing a set of scripts for encrypted backups, specific for very large files and Blu-Ray burning (100GB M-DISC). It's going to be a very handy way of making backups, while absolutely paranoid in terms of encryption, because... why not
[03:51:28] <aquanight> the only real difference is in whether a particular algorithm is random-access or not
[03:52:37] <aquanight> FlorianBad: your use case is not atypical
[03:52:48] <aquanight> people do this kind of thing all the time
[03:52:58] <aquanight> if a crypto library couldn't support it, it's garbage and no one will use it.

[03:54:42] <aquanight> depending on the size of your parameters
[03:54:52] <aquanight> you might consider padding to 512 (disk LBA size)
[03:55:15] <aquanight> or 4096 (large disk LBA and typical FS allocation unit size)
[03:55:22] <FlorianBad> hmm, why?
[03:55:34] <aquanight> ensures your encrypted data starts in its own disk block
[03:55:44] <aquanight> up to you to decide if that's something that matters
[03:56:24] <FlorianBad> interesting, didn't think about that
[03:56:42] <aquanight> I mean
[03:56:53] <aquanight> I wouldn't have thought of the silica gel with the BRD
[03:57:00] <FlorianBad> The thing I'm working on right now is the fork process that stores the passwords so we don't have to retype them for every file. But I want to make sure it doesn't compromise on security
[03:57:04] <aquanight> i have no idea what that's even supposed to do, beyond what you claim it does.
[03:57:51] <aquanight> have the fork process compute the hash
[03:58:29] <aquanight> if you're going to "outsource" the password, then you don't want to 'transfer' it back to the encrypting process
[03:58:39] <aquanight> otherwise you've defeated the point of doing so
[03:59:03] <aquanight> so basically step 1 of your procedure would be done in the forked process
[03:59:11] <aquanight> if it does it multiple times, that's fine.
[03:59:31] <aquanight> if you've got the cores for it, it can be computing the next hash while the first file is being cipher'd

[04:21:31] <aquanight> tksh makes me think of just tclsh with the tk kit preloaded
[04:21:51] <aquanight> actually I think that might be just 'wish'
[04:22:40] <x5c30> i worked with someone long ago who wrote everything as a combination of tcsh and php. i wish i hadn't just remembered that. *brrr*

[05:24:40] <shaldannon> I think my worst one was a company that wanted passwordless TortoiseCVS access to a Linux CVS server, but they didn't want to use sspi for auth.  So I ended up using a combination of Cygwin, ssh keys, an NSIS Windows installer, and a custom Perl script compiled with perl2exe to deploy the mess

[18:07:30] <Altreus> alcohol is the only one of those I know how to use
[18:08:30] <Mandevil> Not sure how it helps with debugging, though ;-)
[18:08:34] <alh> gdb is a great tool (except all of the times it isn't) and is useful to know
[18:09:54] <Botje> gdb --args perl foo.pl, hit r to run
[18:10:02] <Botje> when it crashes, type bt
[18:10:11] <Botje> that gets you a (C) stack trace
[18:10:26] <Altreus> And I drown in that :)
[18:10:29] <alh> Which will likely be useless unless you built perl with debugging symbols
[18:10:31] <Altreus> well it's a start
[18:11:00] <alh> If the segfault is very quick to trigger, you can do something like perl -d:Trace yourprogram
[18:11:05] <alh> And at least see at what point in perl land you're crashing

[21:18:09] <pragma-> ilmari: that sounds familiar
[21:18:27] <ilmari> there's also rperl
[21:18:36] <pragma-> oh, rperl might have been it
[21:18:40] <LeoNerd> For example, it ought to be possible to specify that a given argument be a positive integer
[21:18:48] <pragma-> Yes, I think it was rperl
[21:19:00] <ilmari> involving will braswell, another â€¦ controversial â€¦ character
[21:19:01] <pragma-> https://github.com/wbraswell/rperl
[21:19:02] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ GitHub - wbraswell/rperl: RPerl Compiler ]
[21:19:06] <pragma-> Yes, that's the one
[21:19:31] <LeoNerd> Yah those authors are wellknown for being (I hesitate to use the phrase but I can't think of a better one) "lone gunmen"
[21:19:42] <pragma-> hmm
[21:19:49] <LeoNerd> They come up with an idea they think is brilliant in their heads, then go off and single-handedly impleemnt something, and maybe get a *few* folks onboard. That won't work here
[21:20:08] <LeoNerd> We need a plan for the vast majority. We need it proposed and worked on by people who can work *with* a community, not in spite of it
[21:20:24] <LeoNerd> On personallity alone that rules out Schmorp and wbraswell
[21:20:42] *** Parts: art1 (~romeyke@p200300ccdf0b8300bae0523bd12febf1.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) ()
[21:21:09] <ilmari> and reini
[21:21:21] <LeoNerd> Yah
[21:22:43] <pragma-> I don't know much about the history with those individuals. In the cases of mhellman and braswell, they seem to have accomplished a lot. I still use JSON::XS and I personally thought rperl looked really cool.
[21:22:59] <Grinnz> you should switch to Cpanel::JSON::XS, it fixes a bunch of bugs
[21:23:07] <Grinnz> it is by reini, but at least he accepts PRs
[21:23:41] <Grinnz> (and yes the name is stupid)
[21:23:50] <LeoNerd> Oooh that reminds me - now that 5.35.8 is out, I should start sending PRs to JSON/YAML/etc.. modules to start getting them to accept builtin::isbool and friends
[21:23:55] <pragma-> Yes, the CPanel part of it really makes me hesitate.
[21:24:03] <Grinnz> it has nothing to do with cpanel whatsoever
[21:24:06] <Grinnz> reini doesn't work there anymore
[21:24:14] <LeoNerd> It would be great if 5.36 could launch with a JSON encoder that can properly handle [1, "1", true] entirely correctly
[21:24:15] <pragma-> And I don't want end-users of my script to think my script has anything to do with CPanel either!
[21:24:28] <Grinnz> you can use JSON::MaybeXS if you want a nicer name in front
[21:24:32] <Grinnz> or Mojo::JSON
[21:24:35] <pragma-> hmm
[21:24:39] <Grinnz> both of those will use Cpanel::JSON::XS if installed
[21:24:49] <LeoNerd> JSON::MaybeUTF8 is my usual wrapper module
[21:25:05] <pragma-> But then I have to put Cpanel::JSON::XS in my cpanfile or tell users to install it if they want faster JSON parsing
[21:25:11] <pragma-> With JSON::XS it's just there.
[21:25:19] * pragma- glares at "Cpanel"
[21:25:22] <LeoNerd> Neither of those are core. Someone has to install it anyway
[21:25:32] <Grinnz> eh? JSON::XS isn't any more "just there" than anything else
[21:25:51] <pragma-> Er, I mean the name is just there plainly as JSON
[21:26:10] <Grinnz> yes, JSON.pm is also an unfortunate name for a deficient wrapper module
[21:26:49] <pragma-> I mean in the case of JSON::XS, nobody will have any weird questions that are difficult for me to explain about. They see "JSON" and "XS" and they know what that's about.

[21:27:10] <Grinnz> "it's a fork that fixes bugs and has a crappy name"
[21:27:22] <Grinnz> sure you have to explain it once, but

[21:27:34] <LeoNerd> Hypothetical question: Would you have the same objection to a module called  AUTHOR::PEVANS::JSON  ?
[21:27:36] <Grinnz> easier than, you know, having bugs
[21:27:45] <pragma-> To use JSON::MaybeXS with CPanel::JSON::XS I'd have to tell users to make sure they also install CPanel::JSON::XS otherwise it'll use the slower pure-perl version. Then they go "CPanel? I don't care about CPanel!"
[21:27:49] <LeoNerd> If I just, say, wrote a proper one using all the modern builtins
[21:28:16] <Grinnz> LeoNerd: i would, "Author" namespace is for people's personal use
[21:28:31] *** Joins: djerius (~quassel@pool-108-20-43-199.bstnma.fios.verizon.net)
[21:28:42] <LeoNerd> Well that's my point - that'd be my personal one that I put there
[21:29:07] <Grinnz> i would assume anything in such a namespace has no guarantee of backcompat or usability
[21:29:14] <ilmari> pragma-: JSON::MaybeXS pulls in Cpanel::JSON::XS if a compiler is available
[21:29:27] <pragma-> oh, so I don't have to explicitly mention it anywhere?
[21:29:31] <Grinnz> nope
[21:29:33] <pragma-> oh
[21:29:33] <ilmari> https://metacpan.org/release/ETHER/JSON-MaybeXS-1.004003/source/Makefile.PL#L71-73
[21:29:33] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Makefile.PL - metacpan.org ]
[21:29:35] <pragma-> well that's not so bad then
[21:29:56] <Grinnz> though if it fails to pull it in, the script might end up using JSON::PP which is really slow
[21:30:12] <Grinnz> but that doesn't tend to happen unintentionally
[21:31:04] <LeoNerd> <Beavis> Heh.. hehehe.. You said PP
[21:31:22] <pragma-> ilmari: are those lines saying that the cpan/cpanm installer will add Cpanel::JSON::XS to be installed along with JSON::MaybeXS without any user intervention whatsoever?
[21:31:34] <pragma-> is that what PREREQ_PM does?
[21:31:47] <LeoNerd> Dynamic prereqs. It's a common trick
[21:31:58] <pragma-> Or does Cpanel::JSON::XS already have to be installed or does the user have to install it?
[21:31:58] <ilmari> pragma-: PREREQ_PM lists the modules this module depends on
[21:32:02] <LeoNerd> E.g. it's what my Feature::Compat::* modules do
[21:32:10] <Grinnz> pragma-: yes the configuration will add it automatically
[21:32:15] *** Joins: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel)
[21:32:16] <pragma-> huh.
[21:32:35] * pragma- switches to JSON::MaybeXS then.
[21:32:36] <ilmari> the installer (cpanm, cpan, cpm, cpanplus) will then install those modules before building the current module
[21:32:36] <Grinnz> it's dynamic so that it can be omitted if necessary
[21:33:01] <Grinnz> if cpan recommends were useful, it might be that instead
[21:33:13] <Grinnz> unfortunately i don't think we'll be there for 20 years or so
