[03:18:00] <Suchiman> as long as it gives output to my brain
[03:18:03] <Nasp> I was looking for some myself, but haven't gotten around to it, have a bunch of other tasks
[03:18:09] <Suchiman> and doesn't keep it to itself
[03:18:20] <Nasp> I have a friend who have one of those air filters from Ikea and says they are quite good
[03:18:22] <Suchiman> but reading the reviews is like "this device is reporting fantasy values"
[03:18:26] <Nasp> Not that it monitors the pm2.5 levels and so on
[03:18:38] <Nasp> But he could feel the air was fresher inside and less smelly like when you've made food
[03:19:05] <Nasp> Bah, maybe i should ditch Serilog and try and go with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
[03:19:15] <Nasp> I feel like the wohle scalarvalue thing seems overkill in Serilog
[03:19:16] <Suchiman> Nasp: ewww
[03:19:37] <Nasp> logEvent.AddPropertyIfAbsent(new LogEventProperty("error_message", new ScalarValue(exception.Message)));
[03:19:50] <Nasp> This thing feels overengineered
[03:20:09] <Nasp> I just want to output json in a structure i control and i can't figure out how
[03:20:54] <Suchiman> i feel like i need to buy 3 air quality detectors and then see if at least two of them agree on a value and then return the others lol
[03:21:03] <Nasp> :D
[03:21:08] <Nasp> Yeah if you just have one you don't really know
[03:21:14] <Nasp> Are oyu also being an air filter?
[03:21:24] <Nasp> But step one would be to have a sensor to check if it works
[03:23:13] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah buying an 2 in 1 air purifier + humidifier and a sensor xD
[03:23:35] <Suchiman> although a purifier won't help with CO² concentrations which is the main metrics most of the quality detectors report
[03:23:40] <Nasp> I was planning on buying a bunch of Aqara temp and humidty sensors
[03:23:47] <Nasp> And have one in each room, and one in the fridge and freezer
[03:25:33] <Suchiman> i guess the only metric that air quality detectors report that would be influenced by air purifiers would be TVOC (volatile organic compounds)

[03:40:39] <Suchiman> Nasp: rarely
[03:41:02] <Nasp> I just hate how the other format nested all custom enrichers under fields/properties field in json
[03:41:17] <Suchiman> Nasp: ah compact formatting is flat
[03:41:22] <Nasp> I kinda want to make so i have a "request" field with all request related items

[03:41:29] <Suchiman> yes
[03:41:32] <Nasp> Hmm

[03:58:23] <JD-Robbs> I'm working on a little tool to analyse data that comes in columns. This data can have multiple types such as string?, double?, DateTime? or TimeSpan?. My DataColumn objects can all coexist together in a single collection and are shown to users in WPF controls (e.g. a ListBox). Now, I'm torn between how to implement my types. An abstract DataVariable plus subclasses like DoubleDataVariable vs. generics like DataVariabe<double?>. The problem with the
[03:58:23] <JD-Robbs> latter is that I can't have a collection with multiple different generics contained. Is there some best-practice pattern for this scenario? Not sure I'm making sense.
[04:10:38] <Suchiman> JD-Robbs: if you have a non generic DataVariable base class you can :p

[07:17:49] <vim_fans> 404
[07:17:49] <ern> Hmm
[07:18:00] <ern> Did you really load the proper .NET / asp.net in IIS?
[07:18:05] <ern> if not, it will act like this
[07:18:14] <ern> that is, it has no clue what to do with an "application" and you get 404
[07:18:41] <ern> That is, IIS components (add/remove components) or whatever it's called nowdays
[07:19:02] <ern> or role "Application server"
[07:19:19] <vim_fans> well but i can access the assets in the folder which is where my website point to

[07:26:35] <vim_fans> but my mvc program is 4.0 .net

[10:40:11] <moose> How it usually works here is you join a company, you get your sign on bonus given to you and usually granted as stocks that becomes available for sale (vests) over 4-6 years. Those bonuses are $100k right now
[10:40:21] <moose> So your first year pay is also extremely high
[10:40:49] <moose> You were gone but I mentioned, my friend moved from my team from $320k total cash comp to $900k first year at another company, just went from senior to principal (one level really)
[10:41:18] <moose> So it's not even like we're at the top where I am at, it's much higher apparently which shocked me
[10:41:48] <bomb> lol I've been working for peanuts
[10:41:56] <moose> https://www.levels.fyi is great
[10:42:19] <moose> I also recommend not applying for jobs at the same level as your current role if you've been there more than 2 years
[10:42:23] <moose> Go one higher.
[10:42:49] <bomb> salaries don't differ that much here
[10:42:55] <moose> Make it differ.
[10:43:11] <bomb> trying to start my company
[10:43:26] <moose> Boost your resume somehow and any recruiter who reaches out to you just ask if the base salary is over $200k and say not interested
[10:43:29] <moose> Oh, I see.
[10:43:36] <moose> Your own company, you can charge even more.
[10:44:06] <bomb> yeah, I hope so. but I feel I'll end up even poorer
[10:44:13] <JakeSays> bomb: your own company to do what?
[10:44:33] <moose> It costs them $75-90/hour to hire someone shitty. If you do good work, you can get away with $150-$300/hour easily. Over-estimate, so you can pad yourself. Instead of fixed bid work, try time and materials work where you charge them an hourly rate instead of for the whole project
[10:44:47] <bomb> more like a sole proprietorship JakeSays just indie gamedev stuff
[10:44:53] <moose> Oh, not consulting
[10:44:56] <JakeSays> ah
[10:45:04] <bomb> nah, I'm done with that shit by noqw
[10:45:06] <moose> idk why I remembered you doing consulting
[10:45:07] <bomb> now
[10:45:14] <bomb> I was doing consulting
[10:45:19] <moose> Ahh ok, so I am not crazy
[10:45:26] <bomb> in and out Java
[10:45:31] <bomb> nah, I was the crazy one
[10:46:23] <moose> Are you less crazy now?
[10:46:33] <moose> I feel more crazy, so I am wondering if you gave it to me.
[10:46:54] <bomb> it's actually my last attempt before quitting software engineering altogether
[10:47:19] <bomb> if it fails too, I'll look for sysadmin roles, do music mixing/mastering for others, etc. stuff like that
[10:53:02] <vim_fans_> hi,my mvc application is .net 4.5 but when if my applicaiton pool selected 4.0 verion,my url would return error. if changed to 2.0 version, then it would be fine. why is that?

[12:54:36] <jmer> Nasp: Ask why you weren't invited?
[12:55:48] <Beam> Basically I have sensors giving data values, i send onChanged events up to viewmodels subscribed to them. these viewmodels call NotifyPropertyChanged / RaisePropertyChanged since they're bound to wpf controls. I have about 200 sensors giving a reading every 100ms. Turns out inside PropertyChanged there are some locking mechanisms which keeps bottlenecking but I don't understand why. Cpu usage
[12:55:48] <Beam> is really low.
[12:57:07] <Beam> The locking mechanisms in mention is due to shifting to ui thread for the update i think.
[12:57:42] <Beam> One thing i can thing of is that some kind of suggestion causes multiple of the same sensor value to end up queued for a PropertyChange which further worsens the issue

[16:11:14] <Suchiman> smallville7123: so for example, if you had public LayoutParams layoutParams { get; } = new(); (get only) then layoutParams = new() isn't possible because it's readonly but layoutParams = { ... } would work
[16:11:34] <smallville7123> HelloWorld.cs(20,11): error CS1525: Unexpected symbol `(', expecting `[', `{', or `type'
[16:11:44] <smallville7123> layoutParams = new() {
[16:11:46] <Suchiman> smallville7123: ah, your C# version is too old (TM)
[16:12:00] <Suchiman> smallville7123: then you need layoutParams = new LayoutParams { ... }
[16:12:48] <smallville7123> yay
[16:14:01] <Suchiman> smallville7123: either that or you can pre init layoutParams either in the ctor or via public LayoutParams layoutParams { get; set; } = new LayoutParams();, then your existing code would work too
[16:15:11] <smallville7123> yea, but that seems weird lol
[16:15:38] <Suchiman> why? but fair enough lol

[16:31:13] <smallville7123> does C# automatically initialize primative types?
[16:31:32] <smallville7123> eg     int foo; // will this always be initialized to zero ?
[16:31:38] <jonp> depends on context
[16:31:42] <jonp> if it's a class field, yes.
[16:31:48] <jonp> if it's a local variable, no
[16:31:53] <jonp> that's what definite assignment requires
[16:31:58] <smallville7123> alright
[16:32:05] <jonp> if it's a struct member, it gets weird. :-)
[16:32:21] <jonp> if the containing struct is in a class or array, then it's default initialized to 0
[16:32:27] <jonp> otherwise, definite assignment rules apply
[16:36:09] <Suchiman> jonp: an implementation detail but by default the C# compiler sets the locals init flag which means that (method) locals get zero initialized too but definite assignment rules require you to assign to them before first use anyway
[16:36:32] <jonp> there's a new attribute you can use to disable the locals init flag
[16:36:39] <jonp> but that's opt-in, and requires .NET 5+, iirc

[17:07:42] <jmer> Am I missing something essential or is NFTs comparable to a big book where someone writes "jmer now owns lolcat.gif" but  that doesn't mean jack shit unless everyone agrees what's in that book carries meaning/value?
[17:08:08] <jonp> fairly accurate, by my understanding
[17:08:20] <jmer> jonp: holy moly... It's as dumb as I thought it was.
[17:08:22] <Suchiman> jmer: yep, that book is the blockchain
[17:08:41] <Suchiman> jmer: and you can sell that imaginary ownership :P
[17:08:49] <jmer> Suchiman: yeah... OK... I got it right...
[17:08:54] <jonp> and it's hella expensive, energy wise
[17:08:59] <jmer> Why the hell are people even wasting time on this ?
[17:09:07] <Suchiman> jmer: money laundering and scam
[17:09:12] <jonp> yes, that.
[17:09:28] <jonp> and "plausible deniability" around money laundering and scams
[17:09:29] <jmer> Suchiman: that's the only useful use cases I can come up with as well... And ofc. pyramid scheme like speculation
[17:09:41] <jonp> i.e. money laundering and scams. :-)
[17:09:58] <Suchiman> jmer: it's a negative sum ponzi scheme, they create these things, make a lot of noise about it, sell it further and the scam lives from getting more people invested into it and then bailing out
[17:10:31] <jmer> I had allready concluded this, but I thought "maybe I should resarch more, I'm probably missing something crucial"... But...
[17:10:49] <xb0o2> jmer: unfortunately that's how a lot of modern tech feels.
[17:11:38] <jmer> xb0o2: I disagree. I can see a lot of potential in many new techs... But not NFTs
[17:11:40] <xb0o2> Although that's probably always been true and there's just some mix of survivorship bias and exposure to much more tech now.
[17:11:54] <jmer> (or crypto coins)
[17:17:18] <xb0o2> It's the same thing though, really. Just "oh cool, look at this new <technique or technology here> thing, let's see how many random, inappropriate things we can try to wedge it into to make some cash".
[17:17:23] <jmer> "There’s also a show called Stoner Cats (yes, it’s about cats that get high, and yes it stars Mila Kunis, Chris Rock, and Jane Fonda), which uses NFTs as a sort of ticket system. Currently, there’s only one episode available, but a Stoner Cat NFT (which, of course, is called a TOKEn) is required to watch it. " <- damn
[17:17:43] <jmer> xb0o2: most new techs can be used in a useful manner... I have yet to see a useful use case involving NFTs...
[17:17:48] <SKull> jmer: some people already have everything, so the only thing missing in their life is the ownership of lolcat.jpg
[17:17:52] <xb0o2> NFT isn't the technology, though.
[17:18:14] <jmer> xb0o2: They're an extension to the blockchain, but not all blockchains support NFTs from what I read.
[17:18:20] <xb0o2> Yeah but that's my point.
[17:18:29] <xb0o2> The work on blockchains is the technology.
[17:18:31] <jmer> So you could argue it's "a new technology that extends what a block chain can be used for"
[17:18:38] <xb0o2> That's then used for multiple purposes.
[17:18:42] <SKull> jmer: others however, crave entire countries like the ukraine.
[17:18:44] <xb0o2> NFTs being one of the ones that make no sense.
[17:19:18] <jmer> SKull: WOuldn't it be a mad twist of reality if Putin's attack was based on him buying an NFT that represented Ukraine?
[17:19:44] <SKull> jmer: well... at this point, would it be that mad?
[17:20:08] <jmer> SKull: I no longer know man... Suddenly my ant problems don't seem that big anymnore
[17:20:17] <bomb> I bought a large wheat field in metaverse, I'm rich in a few years.
[17:20:35] <SKull> bomb: but only rich in metabucks
[17:20:38] <jmer> bomb: you should've bought a weed field
[17:20:50] <Suchiman> jmer: and the way to establish value of something NFT is by creating it, then selling it at a ridiculously high value to a second account of yours and then you have that transaction history and a buyer sees that it's at least worth that much :P
[17:21:23] <bomb> Suchiman that business is only feasible for social media influencers and celebrities

[17:21:37] <jmer> Suchiman: I need a hug now...
[17:22:23] <SKull> quick poll: are you fellas back in your offices or still working from home?
[17:22:27] <Suchiman> jmer: i can sell you the ownership over a virtual hug if you like
[17:22:29] <jmer> SKull: both
[17:22:34] <Suchiman> SKull: home
[17:22:44] <xb0o2> SKull: had contract changed to work from home permanently.
[17:23:15] <jmer> Suchiman: Wouldn't that make you the first blockchained prostitute?
[17:23:16] <SKull> xb0o2: i envy you. i went crazy after 12 months of home office
[17:23:40] <SKull> jmer: i'm sure only fans models have been taking bitcoin since the dawn of only fans
[17:23:59] <Suchiman> jmer: last time i've checked, hugs were not sexual favors lol
[17:24:07] <jmer> SKull: WEll they are just cam prostitutes... If you sell a hug that is represented by an NFT that's different?
[17:24:15] <SKull> Suchiman: never say that sentence to your secretary.

[17:27:06] <SKull> jmer: oh i got laid off that job
[17:27:15] <SKull> jmer: funny story actually
[17:27:25] <SKull> jmer: they wanted me to continue to work there after covid
[17:27:36] <jmer> Doing what?
[17:27:45] <Suchiman> after covid he says LOL
[17:27:46] <SKull> jmer: they sold some 'health and wellbeing hotlines' to some very wealthy clients (SWISS RE etc)
[17:28:03] <SKull> jmer: but i didn't get along with the manager that was supposed to be in charge
[17:28:21] <SKull> jmer: so i got laid off
[17:28:23] <SKull> BUT
[17:28:37] <SKull> jmer: then the government ended covid measurements
[17:28:59] <SKull> jmer: then i got a letter that i've been laid off as part of a special mass layoff
[17:29:00] <blez> I got covid atm
[17:29:13] <SKull> jmer: and that i will pe paid full for the next two months
[17:29:25] <SKull> instead of just half of february that they owed me
[17:29:29] <SKull> haha, suckers
[17:29:41] <blez> but I still won't go back to the office
[17:29:53] <jmer> SKull: nice!
[17:29:54] <Suchiman> SKull: lol nice
[17:30:27] <SKull> plus, since i didn't give two shits about that job, i showed that manager dude the middle finger after he wished me luck.
[17:30:33] <SKull> i'm way too old to be proud of that
[17:30:38] <SKull> yet, i am ^^
[17:30:54] <SKull> he basically fired me for admitting to customers that we've made mistakes
[17:30:58] <SKull> like tests getting lost and shit
[17:31:10] <SKull> during a tim where we did multiople throusand tests a day
[17:31:12] <jmer> SKull: Sticking it to "the man" always feels nice xD
[17:31:22] <SKull> the customers even complimented my honesty
[17:31:36] <SKull> and usually would stop complain
[17:31:38] <jmer> SKull: because honesty has become increasingly rare...
[17:31:44] <SKull> but he insisted that i couldn't admit fault on our part
[17:32:04] <SKull> i mean, we're talking about a 40$ test that was paid by the government
[17:32:19] <SKull> no biggie for either side of the transaction
[17:32:49] <SKull> and no harm done by admitting losing something, it was even in the newspapers how many tests we did and that it was too much
[17:32:51] <jmer> SKull: He sounds like a major douchebag
[17:33:08] <SKull> but god forbid we'd admit an error in a reasonable amount of time
[17:33:39] <SKull> jmer: oh he was the epitome of a soulless bootlicker, dressed in a douchebag uniform
[17:34:03] <SKull> i knew that after the first 'talk' he gave me about admitting mistakes on our part
[17:34:42] <SKull> but now that covid is officially no more a concern (despite 20k new infections every day), i dare to look for jobs in IT again
[17:34:49] <jmer> SKull: what was his reasoning for not admitting mistakes?
[17:35:13] <SKull> jmer: there was no reasoning
[17:35:38] <SKull> jmer: i even get it in the context of a highly priced yet useless health and wellbeing hotline for VIP customers
[17:35:38] <jmer> SKull: ah so he just gave you an order?
[17:36:28] <SKull> jmer: but i really thought it was better to say "we've lost your test" instead of waiting until some higher up writes a paragraph about how we're not to blame like a weeek later to the customer
[17:36:45] <jmer> SKull: at least the customer knows to get a new test
[17:36:50] <SKull> jmer: he didn't call it an order, but essentially yes. it's what he learned in business school after all.
[17:36:56] <SKull> jmer: exactly!
[17:37:10] <jmer> I've yet to meet a manager form one of these business schools that adds any value
[17:37:17] <SKull> jmer: the reaction was always "oh, then i'll just get another one to see if it's ok to go to that dinner tonight"
[17:37:34] <jmer> SKull: ofc! people aren't flailing idiots (at least most aren't)
[17:38:53] <SKull> jmer: those people add value to higher ups because they know how to butter them up. regular people are often times too honest to be talking to the high and mighty. they don't like being critized.
[17:39:37] <SKull> jmer: they also know how, at the end of the year, they can convince managers that the last successfull year was their doing
[17:40:04] <SKull> jmer: while the actual people that do the work might have a wildly different and more complex oppinion on the matter
[17:40:06] <jmer> SKull: none of that is adding value it's just pretending to by glory stealing from hard working people xD
[17:40:50] <SKull> jmer: people with a certain amount of money live in a really warkped reality, you need business school sleazebags as an interface between them and actual reality
[17:41:49] <SKull> in the middle ages those sleazebags were advisers to rulers, and successfull tradesmen
[17:43:01] <jmer> SKull: Most rich people I've met has seemed very normal on the surface... I've worked places where I had direct talks with the CEO/Owner...
[17:43:16] <jmer> Also challenged their ideas/reality
[17:43:24] <SKull> jmer: yeah there are some that don't care about their standing in society
[17:44:20] <SKull> when i was a draftsman, we planned this huge villa for this 30 year old super rich guy. he invented a patent that revolutionized tooth implants
[17:44:36] <SKull> at one of those construction meetings, he sat there in a hoodie and a baseball cap
[17:44:47] <SKull> when he objected to one of the architects about something
[17:44:59] <SKull> the architect (in a suit) asked: "who the hell even are you?"
[17:45:21] <SKull> the dude went: "i'm the one paying for this house. but i guess i won't be paying you any longer"
[17:45:39] <jmer> lol
[17:45:47] <bomb> Steve Jobs syndrome
[17:45:48] <SKull>  he had a three story garage
[17:45:51] <jmer> SKull: well Architects are a group of people living entirely in fantasy land xD
[17:45:52] <SKull> a gym
[17:45:56] <SKull> and a cinema in that house
[17:46:20] <SKull> jmer: successful architects yeah.
[17:46:34] <jmer> SKull: any architect that managed to get paid...
[17:47:07] <SKull> jmer: small town architects usually at some point go into real estate, get divorced and end up having to hand over everything to their ex wives. iv'e seen that happening multiple times in the few years i've been a draftsman
[17:47:35] <jmer> SKull: crazy xD
[17:47:48] <bomb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzwlTV2aUMM
[17:48:01] <jmer> I've heard construction engineers complain about architects, that in meetings, wanted buildings that could physically not be built
[17:48:20] <SKull> jmer: that's normal. that's why there are engineers present
[17:48:27] <jmer> and the architect is like "why can't I have it like this" and the argument that "the building will collapse" is incomprehensible to them
[17:48:39] <SKull> jmer: especially architects fresh out of uni have no idea about physics and the reality of construction work
[17:49:12] <jmer> SKull: these have been experienced architects on big prestigious buildings... It's like they are offended the laws of physics doesn't bend to their perspective of "beauty"
[17:49:38] <jmer> SKull: hell I've even heard architects propose that the fire alarms would be placed out of obvious sight because they "ruined the overall expression"....
[17:49:39] <jmer> xD
[17:49:56] <SKull> jmer: i guess we do need some dreamers, otherwise architecture would be very boring
[17:50:21] <jmer> SKull: sure... But come on... Does hard to find fire alarms sound like something that saves lives to you? xD
[17:50:43] <SKull> jmer: that's for the local regulatory office to decide ^^
[17:52:08] <jmer> SKull: I prefer common sense before regulators
[17:52:36] <jmer> hrmpf... adding a container with an icon to the left of the header text, in Visio, is harder than you'd expect
[17:55:41] <Suchiman> and here i thought it's the main work of the architect to construct something that's physically possible, respecting statics and loads and all such
[17:56:17] <jmer> Suchiman:  no no... That's the responsibility of the construction engineer. The Arhictect just doodles something that looks pretty and hopes the engineer is smart enough to build it
[17:56:19] <SKull> jmer: i use draw.io instead of visio. i find visio confusing as fuck
[17:56:30] <SKull> draw.io is much more intuitive
[17:56:39] <jmer> draw.io is browser based
[17:56:47] <SKull> i know. i run my own
[17:57:08] <jmer> ... Aaaand I just got this fancy Visio license after requesting it... So now I'd better use it xD

[20:28:05] <GunArm> so, I'm a dinosaur and just doing some WPF tutorials for the first time
[20:28:26] <GunArm> when i put a button on a form and I could rotate it to a random angle I almost fell out of my chair
[20:29:01] <Suchiman> GunArm: lol yeah WPF is a LOT more flexible than winforms :P
[20:29:17] <GunArm> also, seeing the sophisticated interactivity of the designer I finally can see why the winform designer sucks so bad, cause they've been developing on this the whole time
[20:30:15] <canton7> They've basically had to rewrite the winforms designer recently IIRC
[20:30:44] <canton7> to cope with the fact that it now needs to be out-of-process, to handle the fact that winforms might be running on .net core, but VS is running on framework
[20:30:53] <GunArm> it does seem like since the support was added to core in (what was it 2.1?) the form designer has traded old bugs for new ones
[20:31:19] <canton7> https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/state-of-the-windows-forms-designer-for-net-applications/
[20:31:41] <canton7> ^ that article gives a sense of the scale of the challenge there -- I'm not surprise it's been a bit rocky!

[20:35:37] <humanface> if I have a SomethingManager, a SomethingUI, then UI input would be managed in SomethingUI, and keyboard/controller input would be managed in SomethingManager? or the best way to manage every input in SomethingUI?
