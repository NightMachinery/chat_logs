[00:01:33] <bomb> cloudbender no probs. I still hope the talks begin, and this whole thing ends peacefully.
[00:03:44] <lz_> he should probably write a book
[00:04:43] <lz_> I wonder if there's not the same kind of guys in every city
[00:05:09] <bomb> so what lz_ now you're hating women? looks like it yeah
[00:05:24] <lz_> am I ?
[00:05:27] <cloudbender> I'd rather watch 'Shoe'

[00:28:52] <lz_> lmao tiktok really looks like cancer. and you'd think it couldn't get worse than fb but it did
[00:29:06] <lz_> what next
[00:30:03] <lz_> later in the video she talks about the "couch guy", a guy who was harrassed by millions for looking a bit "sus" when surprised by his gf
[00:31:45] <bomb> surprised by her pregnancy?
[00:31:58] <bomb> I remember something like that
[00:32:22] <lz_> no just her showing up for his birthday or sth and he was just sitting on the couch with friends
[00:32:36] <lz_> and armchair psychologists and "body language experts" decided he was cheating on her but he wasn't
[00:32:46] <bomb> lol
[00:33:07] <bomb> social media is the biggest virus we're fighting right now
[00:33:13] <bomb> and we're also helping it evolve stronger.
[00:33:41] <lz_> social media should certainly be designed to account for our psychological flaws but instead it's designed by greedy shit corps
[00:35:16] <bomb> Instagram and TikTok are great. you just shut down your brain and show off your ass & wealth
[00:35:55] <bomb> if you're poor, and your ass isn't pristine quality, you should protect yourself from those.
[00:37:21] <lz_> I was more talking about systemic ways of reducing potential harrassment. for eg on twitter when someone has a huge following he can indirectly send all his followers after someone else etc
[00:37:27] <lz_> all this shouldn't be made possible in the first place
[00:38:17] <bomb> lynch
[00:38:23] <lz_> reddit is probably an example of how to do things a little less bad (eventhough people are mostly anonymous so it's not a great example either)
[00:39:08] <bomb> I can't be lynched, mobbed, or censored because I don't use social media
[00:39:43] <lz_> bomb: that "caleb" guy was lynched on tiktok, he wasn't on tiktok
[00:39:55] <lz_> they even put billboards about him in some city
[00:40:11] <lz_> asking his employer to fire him etc
[00:40:41] <lz_> on reddit all accounts pushing for this kind of stuff would have been permabanned
[00:41:00] <bomb> reminds me of that forking guy
[00:41:07] <bomb> at Django Con, remember?
[00:41:15] <lz_> no
[00:42:30] <bomb> https://pastebin.com/JaNh0w5F
[00:47:09] <lz_> I highly recommend other videos from Sarah Z on these subjects, she's super insightful (as well as ContraPoints)
[00:47:24] <bomb> who's Sarah Z?
[00:47:38] <lz_> the one talking about Caleb, last link I pasted
[00:48:02] <lz_> maybe too feminist for you though
[00:48:11] <bomb> oh yeah that ginger ctuie. I'd tap that
[00:49:14] <bomb> whoa lz_ check out her instagram. she has a huge rack
[00:49:33] <lz_> sry for you she's gay :)
[00:50:17] <bomb> https://www.picuki.com/media/2649023144433357587
[00:50:22] <bomb> oh yeah found her girlfriend
[00:51:01] <lz_> her gf is trans
[00:51:23] <bomb> so she ultimately enjoys a D
[00:51:33] <lz_> ok
[00:52:17] <bomb> mhm she's on the edge of becoming a whale anyway
[00:52:54] <lz_> I was just saying she was super insightful, not sure why you're obsessed with her breast
[00:53:42] <bomb> not obsessed. it just looks fluffy
[00:54:10] <bomb> anyway, I'm off to watch some combat footage and sleep

[00:58:03] <cloudbender> I don't want this all over my code.
[00:58:08] <lz_> struct
[00:58:15] <cloudbender> (List<string> keys, List<string> vals) mything
[00:58:32] <cloudbender> yeah ok
[01:06:17] <cloudbender> So, I see Grammarly, and Optimizely, so I shall name my custom parser .... wait for it ...
[01:06:20] <cloudbender> Parsely
[01:07:04] <cloudbender> OK c'mon that's effing funny laff dammit

[01:15:17] <cloudbender> I rarely post links, but this one is decent
[01:18:25] <lz_> I'm just finishing Sarah's video about Caleb I posted earlier, and it's funny because the conclusion is just what I was saying. Anyway I still have to applaud how articulate she is, and credit probably goes to her co writer as well
[01:19:10] <lz_> tiktok not only allows harrassment, it's designed for it

[18:58:38] <blez> dude. sounds like someone 16 year old is writing it
[18:59:05] <lz_> it's a translation? not sure how you can assess the writing skills of the original document from which you read a translation
[18:59:19] <blez> no, the content
[19:00:24] <blez> several points are valid, but it's not hard for anyone who knows geopolitics to write this down
[19:01:02] <lz_> lying about ukraine making nuclear weapons is fucking dumb, no one would ever write this as a fiction (yet it's true)
[19:01:12] <blez> geez.
[19:01:29] <blez> how can someone lie in a case of war, right
[19:01:39] <lz_> you'd try to make a believable one maybe

[21:14:58] <hseg> https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20805/Enhancing-C-Enums
[21:15:10] <hseg> java-style enums, I've heard them called before
[21:16:14] <hseg> basically, I want a collection of enums w/ metadata (easy) that can be seen as subtypes of a union of these enums
[21:16:45] <ejjfunky> looks like a enum of classes
[21:17:52] <hseg> yeah, it's less a c-style "collection of named ints" and more a "class whose only values are a static collection of named constant objects"
[21:18:53] <ejjfunky> i don't see anything wrong with this. easier if you just do a collection of classes. but sure, if you like it this way, you can do it this way too.
[21:19:30] <hseg> problem is how to define the union of this collection of enums
[21:20:04] <ejjfunky> hseg, define another class that does the union
[21:20:27] <hseg> which is what I have

[21:28:17] <hseg> problem is that these all use the same underlying enumValues
[21:28:53] <hseg> oh! can filter by type in the particular enum's GetValues() calls
[21:29:01] <ejjfunky> the abstract class inherits from a basetype, and you're creating a new class based on the abstract class.
[21:29:08] <hseg> and that way avoid reengineering effort
[21:29:36] <hseg> problem was that EnumUnion.GetValues() returned the same list, repeated four times
[21:29:56] <hseg> because each of the derived GetValues() gave the same result
[21:31:40] <ejjfunky> could be that you're doing this series of concat, i think
[21:32:23] <ejjfunky> and you're calling Enum1 in your abstract class?

[21:54:22] <Ownix> ejjfunky: thats EF Core Model first, where a user has many invites, an an invite has two one-to-one users.
[21:54:35] <Ownix> And a user has a one-to-one invite as well.
[21:55:36] <ejjfunky> maybe you should call them differently
[21:55:56] <ejjfunky> say, one is invited and the other invitations
[21:56:02] <Ownix> ejjfunky: Look at it this way:
[21:56:03] <Ownix> In my app I can get a user, and get all the invites they created. AND get the invite that they used to redeem their account.
[21:56:03] <Ownix> In my app, I can get an invite, and get the user that created it. AND I can get the user that redeemed it.

[21:56:54] <Ownix> But EF core explodes when it sees this because it can figure out the principal, and it wants me to define the inverse properties and all sorts of stuff
[21:57:59] <ejjfunky> my guess is, EF is having a problem with the singular invite and the List<invite>
[21:58:14] <Ownix> Here it is with Foreign keys only, without any navigation properties at all, this is what it would look like normalized in SQL
[21:58:22] <Ownix> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/xh1Xh4CV/user-invites-no-navs.cs
[21:58:51] <Ownix> Updated, forgot to replace User with int.
[22:01:20] <ejjfunky> yea, if i see your comment, a user can only have one invite as that is how he/she got their account, then that's an invited object. and then, when they got their account, they can make many invitations.
[22:01:49] <Ownix> Exactly
[22:01:59] <Ownix> But, this is chicken before the egg lol
[22:02:08] <Ownix> there has to be one user (God) who created the first invite
[22:02:39] <Ownix> So I pretty much HAVE to make RedeemedInviteId a nullable int.
[22:02:46] <ejjfunky> just make sure that they get their invited object when you initialized the new user
[22:03:10] <ejjfunky> then, when it's done, only then that the user can make invitations

[22:07:38] <Ownix> ejjfunky: What do you mean? I notice in SQL theres no way to do two inserts to two different tables at the exact same time.
[22:07:42] <blez> it was the nicest thing I've seen today
[22:08:28] <ejjfunky> just do it like the link i posted. create the parent/child object, then save them into the context.
[22:14:06] <Ownix> ejjfunky: Well, your link shows that ParentEntity does not have a foreign key, so its not the same. In my example, we essentially see a circular key situation.
[22:16:42] <bpmedley> Ownix : Can you translate your EF Core models into SQL "CREATE TABLE" statements?
[22:16:45] <ejjfunky> Ownix, foreign key should be on the child.
[22:18:06] <ejjfunky> if parents have the child's foreign key and the child has the parent's foreign key. it's circular.
[22:18:58] <ejjfunky> it's like many-to-many, if you think in database term.
[22:30:54] <ejjfunky> Ownix, i'm offline now. Good luck.

[22:37:49] <Nasp> Chicken and egg?
[22:38:39] <Ownix> bpmedley: I havent got that far, in its current state, a user must have an invite to exist
[22:38:40] <bpmedley> Ownix : Now I see an issue.  Your foreign keys map to each table independently.  I have never done that without a mapping table.
[22:38:45] <Ownix> and an invite must have been created by a user
[22:39:05] <Ownix> Its not a many-to-many so I thought I did not need a mapping, or associative/linking table.
[22:39:21] <Ownix> its a one-to-one, another one-to-one, and finally, a one-to-many.
[22:39:28] <bpmedley> Maybe mapping table won't work either.  But, I'm not understanding a schema with two tables that have foreign keys back to each other.
[22:40:57] <Ownix> I dont think thats uncommon, I think I need to allow users to exist without invites, which essentially solves the problem.
[22:41:34] <bpmedley> Ownix : I'm assuming that the Invite referenced in User is only for the User.  Is that a wrong assumption?

[22:43:01] <bpmedley> Ownix : I'm not asking about "code".  I'm asking about a description of the two tables and their relationship with words..
[22:43:55] <Ownix> bpmedley: an invite must be created by a user. A user must have an invite to exist. A user can create many invites.
[22:44:11] <Ownix> IMO the code with comments gives a better picture of this

[22:49:00] <bpmedley> Ownix : Just so I understand, User "A" creates an invite for User "B".  "A" can create many invites.  "B" can create many invites.  "B" and "A" can only have one invite specifically for them?
[22:49:22] <bomb> which one is female, though?
[22:52:29] <bpmedley> Ownix : Also, please remind me, is it ok if there are multiple foreign keys in a table?
[22:52:29] <Ownix> bpmedley: Right, if you are a user, you redeemed an invite to create your account initially. You could not have redeemed multiple invites.
[22:52:59] <Ownix> bpmedley: Yeah, so Invite table would have 2. One to link tothe user that created it, and one to link to the user that redeemed it.
[22:53:23] <bpmedley> Ownix : So, you need 3 foreign keys for your two tables?
[22:53:27] <Ownix> The user table would have a key to the invite table (the invite that the user redeemed initially)
[22:53:31] <Ownix> yes
[22:53:43] <bpmedley> I see two foreign keys in your .sql file..
[22:54:39] *** Joins: lara99 (~lara99@93-36-163-139.ip61.fastwebnet.it)
[22:55:05] <moose> TBH I would have a table for users, one for pending invites, and one for redeemed invites. The pending and redeemed invite tables will be identical in structure having a two foreign keys into the user table to indicate who is the sender and who is the receiver user for the invite.
[22:55:15] <Ownix> bpmedley: I messed up when I created that SQL
[22:55:30] <moose> IDK what the question is though, too far to scroll back for me
[22:55:42] <bpmedley> moose : Why not a flag for pending and redeemed?
[22:56:08] <bpmedley> Said another way, moose , why not a one table and one flag?
[22:57:33] <moose> bpmedley: It depends on how many users/invites one is expecting I guess. By design, a redeemed invite to me is different than a pending invite. You're gonna need to hit that table to verify if an invite has been redeemed already or if there's cancellation support also to verify if revoked.
[22:57:58] <moose> So you may as well make it as small as possible. I imagine that you will only need to query redeemed invites rarely, compared to unredeemed ones.
[22:58:11] <bpmedley> moose : Why not a partial index?
[22:58:13] <moose> You could do one table and partition on the flag though, that's probably fine too.
[22:59:34] <moose> You could do a partial index, but I personally like having a separate table for the separation. That separation is the deciding factor for me.
[22:59:56] <bpmedley> Ownix : So, are you getting an error with the .Add and .SaveChanges?  Or, is there an error elsewhere?
[23:00:30] <moose> I wouldn't harp on someone if they used an index though, but I'd prefer not to especially in MSSQL.

[23:01:22] <pandem> just dont delete things and there are no more problems

[23:03:00] <Ownix> bpmedley: I havent tried yet, my goal was to have all the navigation properties set right, generate the migration and inspect it, appy it, inspect SQL server and make sure it looks sensible, and finally, insert an invite, followed by a user, and THEN start coding to add users/invites and stuff.
[23:03:49] <moose> bpmedley: The support is fine but the estimator doesn't like them and you need to be particular about result set ordering and the ordering of predicates in the query and also there's special consideration for foreign keys.
[23:04:00] <bpmedley> Ownix : Were you looking for validation that your EF Core Entity Model was created correctly before you started actively developing?
[23:04:04] <moose> Most people just YOLO and don't care though
[23:04:28] <bpmedley> moose : Thanks for telling me.  I have never used Partial Indexes in MSSQL..
[23:06:41] <irwiss> man, after fiddling around android's hilt i can appreciate how KISS and easy asp core's DI is... incredible how hilt devs made DI be more verbose and fragile than not having DI
