[03:35:08] <SpaceVimBot_> <wintermute2021> Hello. With `ctrl-x/ctrl-o` I got an error :  `E117 : fucntion unknown : popup_create`
[06:22:56] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> It seems your vim is too old. do you have a try with latest version of vim.
[06:23:01] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> or maybe use neovim.
[06:44:44] <SpaceVimBot_> <Shougo> The function is added in 8.1.1364
[06:45:02] <SpaceVimBot_> <Shougo> I think SpaceVim requires Vim 8.2
[06:55:55] <SpaceVimBot_> <Reficulx> I have tried to set up a project root directory with space p p, but it still does not work. I still could not run the main function of app.java file, which is able to run successfully through an IDE. When I try to save app.java, just simply typing :w in the space vim editor. It seems that app.java could not detect other classes under the same package, which causes a lot of compiling errors. I am just wondering how to solve t
[06:58:56] <SpaceVimBot_> <Reficulx> it also seems that javalsp does not work for my codes in the application project directories.
[07:13:21] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> @Reficulx Hi, do you have a try with maven project. for simple java project, maybe we should add current directory to classpath. so it should be a bug. BTW, you need to show me more info about your reproduce step.
[07:14:15] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> @Shougo yeah, phpcomplete requires vim8.2, but spacevim should support old vim too, so I will add simple flag to use old phpcomplete.
[07:14:25] <SpaceVimBot_> <Reficulx> Hi, @wsdjeg ! Thank you for your quick reply! What info do you want?
[07:14:39] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> what is your project struct.
[07:14:51] <SpaceVimBot_> <Reficulx> I am working on a Ubuntu 20.04 system on a dual booted mac
[07:14:53] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> I means the filetree
[07:15:00] <SpaceVimBot_> <Reficulx> the project is a gradle proejct
[07:15:55] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> ok, now please open the java file, run `:w`
[07:18:42] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> now what is the result of `:echo g:neomake_java_javac_gradle_classpath`
[07:33:50] <SpaceVimBot_> <Reficulx> it is {'app/build.gradle':''}
[07:48:03] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> Does code completion work?
[07:48:21] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> I mean java omnifunction, you can test it via `ctrl-x/ctrl-o`
[07:48:29] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> in insert mode.
[08:41:01] <SpaceVimBot_> <wintermute2021> @wsdjeg : Yes, you are right : my Vim version is too old (8.1.14).
[16:40:11] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> @wintermute2021 so you need to update your vim, or maybe you can use neovim. It has built-in lsp.
[16:41:17] <SpaceVimBot_> <wsdjeg> @wintermute2021 Hi, have you solved your issue now?
