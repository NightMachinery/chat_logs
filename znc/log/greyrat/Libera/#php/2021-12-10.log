[00:10:51] <CorvetteZR1> PHP message: PHP Warning:  scandir(./tcpulse/tcpulse): Failed to open directory
[00:11:14] <CorvetteZR1> is tcpulse something in php?  that's the directory i moved and it works now
[00:11:21] <CorvetteZR1> relipse, www.anonvdi.ca
[00:12:09] <CorvetteZR1> relipse, so the part that breaks, is after you log in, there is a MYSHARE option in the drop down menu that lets you upload/download files for storage
[00:12:46] <CorvetteZR1> so, when i had the tcpulse dir there, it was breaking for that user and wasn't showing anything
[00:12:49] <relipse> what is it like a proxy server?
[00:13:05] <AllenJB> I have never heard of tcpulse
[00:13:06] <CorvetteZR1> kinda, sorta...just a remote desktop
[00:13:16] <CorvetteZR1> yea, can use it like a proxy i guess
[00:13:44] <CorvetteZR1> lets you open a browser in the vdi and browse and stuff...and you can save stuff to myshare in the vdi and then download it from the webui, and vice versa

[01:14:20] <judah> Some of my projects, I use TDD exclusively. I have some projects though, its just not viable. Too many unknowns in the implementation details. Normally TDD goes "write test -> write implementation -> tests pass" but this project goes "write test -> write implementation -> revise implementation -> rewrite tests -> tests pass"
[01:14:42] <judah> Easier to just skip the first step and a half
[01:16:25] <dag> dont think the test should test the implementation details though? that be too much work because tests most be modified constantly

[01:22:26] <judah> No, you are right. The challenge comes in when you are trying to build new features that need to integrate with eachother, but the interfaces between the components is not yet defined
[01:23:28] <judah> If you just write the test for the feature, you back yourself into a corner. You cant write the interfaces before the feature exists, but you also have to change the implementation to implement the interface
[01:23:58] <judah> The logical solution would be to write the interfaces first, but since the features dont yet exist that is difficult as well

[02:08:18] <PersonX> Hello, just curious if I can get a bit of advice/guidance. I am trying to scrape some some JSON data via URL https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams - Now, what would be the best method to get this data constantly updating in a database? Cron? Or just a simple script in my application/website, that every time someone clicks on the "team" page, it
[02:08:18] <PersonX> updates the tables/database? Also, not sure on how to separate the data in that format. Thank you.
[02:09:25] <judah> Sorta depends on your application and how up to date you need your data
[02:10:10] <judah> If you just need it cached locally, I would make a request when the user needs the data and keep a cached copy
[02:10:32] <judah> If you need to actively query against the data a cron job might be your best bet
[02:10:41] <Albright> Absolutely a cron job
[02:11:13] <Albright> Doing queries each time someone clicks the "team" page will be slow and usually redundant.
[02:11:47] <Albright> Even if you end up having to do that approach, at least make sure X hours have passed since the last cron request so it's not slow for everyone.

I think that would be the route. I'm just stumped on how to get that data in proper format in my database via a PHP script. Thank you

[02:22:00] <Albright> PersonX: Do you already have the database structured?
[02:22:45] <PersonX> Albright: I do, for teams, and players. I just am fairly new to PHP, so it's a bit tricky, even reading up on some of the guides/pages I have.
[02:23:55] <Albright> You'll use json_decode() to turn the data into a structure you can iterate over, then create the queries to insert/update the data in the database.
[02:24:36] <Albright> The specifics will vary based on the structure of the JSON, the structure of your DB, and what database library you're using if any, but that's the basics.

[02:41:27] <PersonX> Albright: Sorry for the highlight, but if you take a quick gander at https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams - There seems to be copyright and teams, but within teams, there are other "keys" ? I guess they would be (forgive me if I'm wrong). I did a simple foreach, and am getting copyright and teams (but can't figure out how to get the data
[02:41:27] <PersonX> within each team) any more guidance to also get the data within teams? Since there are 31 within. Just need a pointer, thank you.
[02:42:19] <Albright> Yes, so you'd iterate $json->teams like an array, right?
[02:42:29] <Albright> `foreach ($json->teams as $team) {`
[02:43:23] <Albright> Then the name would be in `$team->name`, the location at `$team->locationName`, etc
[02:43:53] <PersonX> ah, thank you. That was my confusion.
[02:54:22] <PersonX> I've gotten all the data within, but if you look you can see "franchise" and other stuff such as division, conference, etc. Those have values within them, I can't do $team->franchise, obviously. How do I get the values within those keys as well? That would be my last question, thank you Albright
[02:55:27] <Albright> PersonX: Do $team->franchise->franchiseId, $team->franchise->teamName, etc.
[02:55:40] <Albright> $team is an object, as is $team->franchise
[02:56:09] <Albright> The `->` arrow just means "access this method/property of the object."
[02:56:30] <Albright> And the property of an object can be another object, among other variable types.
[02:59:21] <PersonX> ah!

[06:00:03] <CorvetteZR1> hi.  i have lots of this:     $tmp = get_absolute_path($tmp_dir . '/' .$_REQUEST['file']);
[06:00:34] <CorvetteZR1> which throws a warning like this:    PHP Warning:  Undefined array key "file" in
[06:00:45] <CorvetteZR1> what's the correct syntax here to silence the warning?
[06:01:17] <Blondie101010> do you know what $_REQUEST is?
[06:01:25] <CorvetteZR1> it doesn't like that file is a string?  should declaring it as a var help?  i'm not sure if that's the most effcient way to do it ...
[06:01:53] <Blondie101010> wrong assumption
[06:02:40] <CorvetteZR1> no, i don't know what it is actually...don't see it being declared anywhere for this function
[06:03:02] <Blondie101010> that's a combination of $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE
[06:03:12] <Blondie101010> so things that are sent from the client
[06:03:36] <Blondie101010> therefore you can not rely on the fact that it will have something in it
[06:04:11] <__adrian> CorvetteZR1: the error itself means that you're trying to use "file" but it doesn't exist.
[06:04:15] <Blondie101010> so if your code depends on the existence of that $_REQUEST['file'], you need to put a condition on it, and otherwise abort
[06:04:26] <__adrian> but more importantly, DO NOT EVER let the user choose filepaths on your server.
[06:05:08] <CorvetteZR1> well, this function is a file browser...so it's doing stuff with filepaths, etc
[06:05:43] <Blondie101010> hopefully it's well secured

[06:06:27] <Blondie101010> that's almost worst
[06:06:34] <CorvetteZR1> :D
[06:06:37] <Blondie101010> it means you have absolutely no good reason to do that
[06:06:50] <__adrian> CorvetteZR1: you're passing the request along with your temp directory all at once. the function can't handle that safely.
[06:07:08] <__adrian> and commercial vs. personal doesn't matter either, not in the slightest.
[06:07:28] <CorvetteZR1> i don't.  you can check it out here if you'd like: www.anonvdi.ca  .  i'm not a programmer by any stretch
[06:07:57] <Blondie101010> is that your site
[06:07:59] <__adrian> ?
[06:08:07] <__adrian> i'm not asking about your site
[06:08:21] <CorvetteZR1> the file browser thing is in the site
[06:08:28] <__adrian> i'm saying that your code should be taking a different approach
[06:08:40] <CorvetteZR1> if you login, you'll see MYSHARE in the drop down...and that's the code that trips those warnings
[06:08:47] <__adrian> looking at your site doesn't help with this issue
[06:08:58] <CorvetteZR1> __adrian, yea, i understand what your saying...i'll see if i can refactor it
[06:09:17] <__adrian> the issue with the warning was answered. did you understand that? or is it still unclear?
[06:09:32] <CorvetteZR1> but, that portion is some code i copied and stuck in there a long time ago, in php 7.0 days...and it's throwing a lot of warning/errors after php8 update
[06:10:02] <__adrian> do you understand the problem and how to solve it? or do you still have questions?
[06:10:11] <CorvetteZR1> __adrian, i understood it to some extent, i'm just not sure how much of the logic i need to change to implement it properly
[06:10:32] <__adrian> the idea you need to put into your code is that you _validate_ input before you try to use it
[06:11:12] <__adrian> the most obvious validation is to make sure it exists, before you try to use it. BUT you need to also make sure it's they right type, and that it makes sense for what it's supposed to be.
[06:11:32] <__adrian> for example, if you ask for a birthday and i tell you "yellow," that's not valid.
[06:11:52] <__adrian> validation needs to come first, before you actually jump into "doing things."
[06:12:38] <CorvetteZR1> right, i get that
[06:12:46] <__adrian> this leads into the problem i was talking about: letting users choose filepaths is _very risky_ and _very hard_ to get right.
[06:13:05] <__adrian> can you imagine what you need to validate for your "file" input?
[06:14:09] <CorvetteZR1> well, no...because i copied this code from somewhere and not show how it's written and where the validation should happen...i just feed it a path to work with; which can't be set by the user
[06:14:27] <CorvetteZR1> not sure*
[06:15:16] <__adrian> that's not actually true. you'd need to look at how that function works to be sure, but it's actually rather unlikely it can do things correctly/safely.
[06:15:45] <CorvetteZR1> it's actually this thing that i'm playing with:  https://github.com/jcampbell1/simple-file-manager
[06:16:24] <__adrian> we can tell by the way it's called: you don't validate $_REQUEST['file'] before you use it. and you add extra stuff to it before you give it to that function, so the function can't know what the input actually was.
[06:16:30] <__adrian> k, let's see
[06:19:57] <__adrian> so they got that idea from a user comment on php.net (don't assume user comments are good). the intent was to make a version of realpath() that "works on files that don't exist."
[06:20:19] <CorvetteZR1> looking at this repo now, i see there's been quite a few commits since i cloned it in 2018...some security and best practice fixes
[06:20:51] <__adrian> this is entirely ...wrong. you can't make a realpath() that works on files that don't exist, because files that don't exist aren't real.
[06:21:08] <__adrian> think about the things we would need to validate for a "file" input.
[06:21:47] <__adrian> my list would be  (1) leads to a file  (2) that file is allowed to be accessed.
[06:21:51] <__adrian> does that make sense to you?
[06:22:59] <CorvetteZR1> yea, it makes sense...i understand what you are saying, i just have no idea how to code it.
[06:23:07] <__adrian> we'll get there
[06:23:20] <__adrian> you can't jump straight to writing code when you don't know what your goal is
[06:23:39] <__adrian> (1) already has a solution - the one this author broke. use realpath().
[06:24:15] <__adrian> if realpath() fails, you know the input is bad, and you're done.
[06:24:34] <__adrian> if realpath() succeeds, then you can check whether the file is allowed to be accessed.
[06:24:37] <CorvetteZR1> ok, but the objective is to give user access to a directory
[06:24:41] <CorvetteZR1> not to go to a file
[06:24:55] <__adrian> directories _are_ files
[06:25:02] <CorvetteZR1> ok, just wanted to clarify
[06:25:36] <__adrian> so how do you know whether to allow access? e.g., is there a specific directory that they're limited to?
[06:26:36] <CorvetteZR1> yes, that's right
[06:26:36] <__adrian> your code above implies you want/expect the "file" to be under your $tmp_dir
[06:26:39] <__adrian> ?
[06:26:43] <__adrian> k
[06:27:06] <__adrian> so once you have the realpath, you can check where it really is.
[06:27:35] <__adrian> taking a break: did you use code from this project in your own script? or are you simply using this project?
[06:28:00] <__adrian> if you're using it, then yes, you should update it
[06:28:22] <__adrian> in addition to reviewing it to decide whether it's well-written, maintained, etc..
[06:28:45] <CorvetteZR1> yea, i'm just using this...i modified a little bit, but those are small mods i can apply to new version
[06:29:33] <CorvetteZR1> i need to step away for a bit too, gonna go for a walk in the snow
[06:29:48] <__adrian> more generally, i would not recommend writing your own file browser in php. use an ftp client. if you need better integration with a website, there are existing projects that you should use instead (better developed and maintained than this one).
[06:29:52] <__adrian> sure
[06:30:07] <CorvetteZR1> right, the idea is that it should be integrated into the same webui and accessible from site
[06:30:21] <CorvetteZR1> so you can copy stuff to myshare in the vdi and fetch it from the webui and vice versa
[06:30:45] <__adrian> https://github.com/jcampbell1/simple-file-manager/blob/master/index.php#L9-L10  this is a BIG RED FLAG btw
[06:31:00] <CorvetteZR1> it was a quick and dirty solution (again, hobby project, not a commercial revenue stream)...it seemed to work OK, but definitelly not anything professional
[06:31:12] <__adrian> https://github.com/jcampbell1/simple-file-manager/blob/master/index.php#L19  this one's even worse
[06:31:23] <__adrian> that's not the problem  :)
[06:31:51] <__adrian> it doesn't have to be "professional." it has to correctly do the things it's supposed to do.
[06:32:06] <__adrian> like i said, professional vs. personal doesn't matter
[06:32:37] <CorvetteZR1> what i mean to say is, if i was doing this for work, it wouldn't have launched like this :)
[06:33:01] <CorvetteZR1> anyway, be back in bit
[06:33:33] <CorvetteZR1> if we don't talk later, just want to thank you for all your advice on this.  will take me a bit of time to figure this out, but i kind of have a starting point now

[12:56:22] <locsmif> Hi all. I realise this might be a controversial question, but out of intellectual curiosity, is there a more elegant way to do $$var = $foo (other than $<content of $var> = $foo of course)? Something that looks more 'formal' so to speak? I.e. a more formal way to declare a variable dynamically in the local scope?
[12:56:57] <TinoDidriksen> Yes, don't. Use arrays instead.
[12:57:31] <locsmif> I understand that, but the fact of the matter is, the language still syntactically allows this.
[12:57:42] <TinoDidriksen> And it shouldn't.
[12:58:11] <locsmif> But it still does... So, that's why I'm asking a question about it.
[12:58:14] <AllenJB> The language syntactically allows a lot of things. That doesn't mean you should do them all.
[12:58:18] <locsmif> Hmm
[12:59:00] <locsmif> When you talk about symrefs, it's as if you're discussing politics at Christmas or something ::P
[13:00:58] <AllenJB> While in some cases they can be useful, they are generally a bad idea and there's often a better way to achieve what you want to do. Without knowing what you want do, it's hard to give more advice than "avoid them"

[15:05:32] <AllenJB> If the version specifier in composer.json is "*" then composer will update libraries across major versions - which generally isn't something you want to do accidentally / non-explicitly because BC breaks in those version upgrades will break your application.
[15:06:28] <AllenJB> See also the composer show command and its options that allow you to check for libraries which have updates available beyond the composer version specifier

[15:15:58] <AllenJB> Obligatory: While DB based queues can work for low velocity / volume queues, I would highly recommend looking at proper queue servers such as RabbitMQ. They provide a much bigger range of features, including built-in monitoring / metrics, and you're much less likely to have issues with implementation bugs.

I am using doctrine and dont seem to be an existing thing for this

[16:56:02] <AllenJB> freeman_h1: You might want to look at `clone` - clone the object, reset / clear the primary id and overwrite data as desired.
[16:59:43] <stenno> if you create a new object and don't persist it, no primary key should be created (assuming PK is autoincrement)
[16:59:53] <stenno> and flush will not write it to db

[21:34:53] <Albright> Used? Or free?
[21:35:14] <Togra> used, it's mathing it with disk_total_space()
[21:35:32] <Albright> Is disk_total_space() returning the correct number?
[21:35:41] <Togra> yeah, 108G
[21:35:55] <Albright> Hmm. What filesystem?
[21:36:00] <Togra> UFS, under freebsd
[21:36:25] <da_wunder> and you don't have different partions?
[21:37:04] <Togra> this disk just has the one gpart slice, no other partitions on that disk
[21:37:21] <Albright> If disk_total_space() is returning the right number, it makes me think the partitions are correct.
[21:37:24] <Togra> there's a boot disk and this second drive, the boot disk has all the appropriate stuff going on but this disk just has the one big data partition
[21:37:58] <Togra> I'm giving both of those methods the mountpoint as the arg, and they seem to react correctly to that, just a bit off

[21:42:25] <Albright> Not sure what.
[21:43:16] <Togra> it would make sense for this to be a UFS specific issue, especially if everyone on linux or other platforms don't have any issues with it

[23:35:57] <BadAdviceCat> Tach, the popular use of custom session handler is to store the session into an SQL database instead so that way, it is possible to get a list of sessions by a particular user, and then delete them all together.
[23:37:52] <BadAdviceCat> It can also be useful if you're sharing a server with other people and you don't want them to have access to your sessions. (Eww, shared hosting is not a good idea, should use a VPS or Dedicated server, and then this will not be necessary)
[23:38:07] <Tach> BadAdviceCat indeed but most existing frameworks use - even with custom storage backend - zend session under the hood.
[23:38:28] <Tach> php session I mean
[23:38:58] <relipse> i'm still interested in creating my own sessions without session_start() etc
[23:39:28] <relipse> for some reason my server session only lasts like 10 minutes
[23:39:31] <BadAdviceCat> Or if you have more than one web servers because you want to do this thing called "Load Balancing". Each load balanced web server can use redris/or similar, and then connect to a centralized database (That One database server that all Load balanced web servers each share.)
[23:41:09] <BadAdviceCat> If you're not doing any of those, just stick to regular PHP session, it's fine, they aren't going to bite you. Even I use regular PHP sessions, despite knowing this. (And I do not have to worry about other users accessing my sessions because I do not use a shared server.)
[23:41:58] <Sammitch> the answer is "check your session settings" not "roll your own sessions from scratch"
[23:42:34] <relipse> i've tried over and over again manipulating the session timeout and all that , nothing worked, still 10 minute sessions
[23:42:42] <BadAdviceCat> Definitely check the session settings. Sheesh, don't we have enough session handling libraries already? LOL.
[23:44:04] <Sammitch> BadAdviceCat: my favorite is "sessions bad, JWTs good" and then they pass 2MB of encoded text in every request and response and wonder why their app is slow
[23:46:40] <Tach> BadAdviceCat you can do HA with just a different storage backend
[23:47:00] <BadAdviceCat> ROFL.

[23:48:32] <BadAdviceCat> What's UD and google?
[23:48:32] <relipse> and is JWT a php thing?
[23:48:56] <Sammitch> it's like DN

[23:58:05] <judah> I would go live in the datacenter
[23:58:37] <judah> im only a programmer because I happen to be good at it, I dont really enjoy it. I would much rather be closer to the hardware, but those jobs are few and far between
