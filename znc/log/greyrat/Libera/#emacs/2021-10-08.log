[05:22:25] *** Quits: Codaraxis (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[05:23:09] <skangas> I don't think I'd want to go back to not using tags at this point, to be honest.  Not sure what I'm looking for.  Possibly just to know how it compares to mu4e, and I'm curious to know what is the actual difference between rmail and MH-E.
[05:23:29] <skangas> I'd also be curious to know the status of Wanderlust and mew, and what they have to offer.
[05:23:47] <parsnip> the tags paradigm seems to be the aspect that makes it hard for people to easily try either of mu and notmuch
[05:23:49] <skangas> IOW, this is me idly thinking about all the stuff that is out there and the amount of work it would be to try all this stuff for myself.
[05:24:10] <parsnip> i like that mu is sort of stateless, compared to notmuch
[05:24:40] <skangas> In what way?
[05:24:46] <bpalmer> labels also seem to confuse lots of gmail users, and crossposting gnus users.
[05:24:48] <parsnip> skangas: presumably wanderlust was an answer to Gnus being hard to use as an email client
[05:25:16] <skangas> Wanderlust is unmaintained these days, is it?
[05:25:29] <parsnip> skangas: stateless in what way? if you nuke your notmuch directory, presumably you lose all the binning
[05:25:37] <bpalmer> Maybe; my impression is wanderlust was really designated as an IMAP-first client whereas gnus only kind of grudgingly dealt with IMAP
[05:26:05] <parsnip> skangas: i think wanderlust might be one of the "ancient japanese elisp runes (ruins?)"
[05:26:40] <parsnip> i still preferred Gnus to Wanderlust for some reason, before i got into mu
[05:26:43] <skangas> IMAP is pretty unattractive to me; I find it too slow.
[05:27:00] <parsnip> yep, local indexing is compelling
[05:27:29] <parsnip> some people had rube goldberg setups for local IMAP
[05:27:39] <skangas> The search I get with notmuch beats anything I've used in the past, except for the built-in GMail search that is equally fast (but also ugh, Google)
[05:27:42] <parsnip> to make IMAP local, thus faster

[05:28:22] <parsnip> skangas: to be honest, i use fastmail, and i tend to use it more often than mu4e most of the time, as i don't do a lot of personal emailing

[05:28:50] <skangas> IMAP has built-in mirroring that seems pretty cool if the server has support for it.  Of course, I just used something dumb like fetchmail and later mbsync to get into a Maildir and then pointed the IMAP server to it.

[05:32:05] <skangas> parsnip: So why do you prefer mu to notmuch?
[05:32:29] <jtgd> one thing I like is being able to have an org-mode link that takes me straight to the email.
[05:32:51] <skangas> parsnip: Is it just the stateless thing you were talking about basically, or something else?
[05:33:26] <skangas> jtgd: That's extremely important for me as well.

[09:06:08] <codingquark> I don't see such machines at supermarkets etc. That is quite a nice thing to do I suppose

[09:06:57] <twb> codingquark: customers cannot see the ones here
[09:06:57] <bpalmer> Reduce is actually an interesting problem with, e.g., plastic bags for shopping. Most people assume that a reusable cloth bag is more environmentally friendly
[09:07:15] <twb> bpalmer: depends how many times you reuse each
[09:07:48] <bpalmer> but on a number of metrics, the number of times you have to use the bag is so ludicrously high (in the tens of thousands of shopping trips) it actually works out to be more "environmentally friendly" to use the plastic

[17:50:27] <hodapp> judybot: The curious thing about postmodernism is not even in what it includes and excludes from the discussion, but in the things it demurs on the decision (if it can even be called that) to refuse to even state whether or not it takes a stance on
[17:50:57] <grym> rpav: whatever EC2 does 
[17:51:27] <grym> the meta-issue here is that nobody has ever once written down minimum deployment specs for this product 
[17:51:41] <judybot> hodapp: the question of truth. The postmodernist is not interested in truth, but in the ways in which we construct our own truths.
[17:51:41] <grym> so there's some friction, and i'm stubbornly maintaining it's not my problem 
[17:51:53] <rpav> grym: not more what docker does? i mean, EC2 provides you a gpu and it doesn't matter if someone else on the same physical is using _their_ gpu allocation does it?
[17:52:05] <grym> rpav: like i said, i don't know 
[17:52:08] <rpav> ah
[17:52:21] <grym> rpav: but if you point tensorflow and pytorch at the same GPU at the same time, they usually try to claw one another's eyes out 
[17:52:41] <hodapp> grym: part of why I left the last client is after having to deal with their brilliant idea in which for "fault tolerance" they wanted my single Go program which could handle N camera streams to be turned into N separate k8s containers running on a single node

[17:56:06] <hodapp> in my original design, the Go program served up a WebSocket and anyone who wanted a stream of the results just connected to it, and as a result, it didn't have to know or care what the client was or have its IP/hostname coupled in
[17:56:08] <hodapp> the "redesign

[19:52:19] <johnjay> it doesn't even add more buttons until I specify #lang racket
[19:52:30] <lisp123> My company (non-IT) doesn't "get" Emacs, so I doubt they would allow. Although to be fair, using portacle on windows is a sneaky way to hack into the main machine

[21:42:17] <rudybot> grym: rst was designed. It compiled to an IR. It can emit PDF or TeX as well as HTML. It cleanly separates syntactic markup from semantic markup. It supports a number of semantic markups not seen in markdown. It was not only designed, there is a document describing *alternative* markups for each semantic item, and why they weren't chosen.

[22:45:35] <EdwardIII> i'm looking at this to get a fennel repl in emacs: https://github.com/emacsmirror/fennel-mode it says 'ou can override the location by setting inferior-lisp-program. For instance, if you have a stdio repl in a LÖVE game', which is awesome, just what i want to do. but presumably i don't want to set inferior lisp program for every single mode. should i just add when in fennel mode, then set
[22:45:37] <EdwardIII> inferior-lisp-program'? or is there a better way? 
[22:47:05] <johnjay> i don't think there is a fennel-mode in emacs?
[22:47:11] <johnjay> i'm not getting any in this 27.2 instance
[22:47:47] <EdwardIII> johnjay: i've installed that fennel-mode.el in my emacs

[22:48:28] <EdwardIII> i think it's working because it shows this these modes down the bottom: (Fennel WK FlyC-)
[22:49:12] <artefact> fyi you can use diminish.el to hide some minor modes from the modeline
[22:49:45] <EdwardIII> i'm happy to see them while i'm a supernoob :) thanks for the pointer though, will no doubt become handy when i'm a pro
