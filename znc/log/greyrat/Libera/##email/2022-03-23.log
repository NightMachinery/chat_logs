[07:20:19] <ih8wndz> Well, I was asked today about supporting hippa, my initial reponse was no
[07:20:39] <lunaphyte> as the recipient?  or as the sender?
[07:20:54] <jaybe> unless it's point to point; no
[07:21:05] <lunaphyte> that's not entirely true
[07:21:14] <lunaphyte> it depends on the answer to my question
[07:21:54] <jaybe> i've worked with hipaa data for a long time; email is not an acceptable transfer method if it outside of a point to point and or closed system/network
[07:21:55] <ih8wndz> lunaphyte: I'm sure both
[07:22:24] <jaybe> even then, it's beyond discouraged because humans can click 'forward
[07:22:32] <jaybe> if it's for machines, it can be 'justified' and acceptable
[07:22:57] <lunaphyte> as the recipient, if you offer encryption, then there is a reasonable argument that you "support" hipaa
[07:23:39] <lunaphyte> as a sender, feel free to employ policies which do not relay mail to given destinations unless transport encryption is in place
[07:23:54] <jaybe> one cannot 'fail to support and uphold hipaa'. won't even get approved unless the design takes into account such an as not using email on the open internet. only p2p and purposeful machine connections if absolute necessary.
[07:23:56] <lunaphyte> and inform your leadership that there will be an impact to doing that
[07:24:31] <jaybe> no breach of hipaa is an acceptable breach for any company with these types of data and records. surely you're fined horribly if the sla is tested.
[07:24:49] <jaybe> and you get 'published' for the breach, etc.
[07:24:53] <jaybe> you'll need and want to avoid that :)
[07:25:05] <lunaphyte> while a human further acting upon some piece of data isn't relevant to mail server compliance, it's important in that one needs to understand hipaa compliance goes far beyond technical infrastructure
[07:25:12] <ih8wndz> jaybe: thanks
[07:25:17] * ih8wndz opens 25 back up
[07:28:18] <ih8wndz> Yeah I don't really want to go down the hipaa road
[07:30:44] * ih8wndz wonders though how much spam would be mitigated with 25 encrypted :)
[07:30:55] <rob0> not much
[07:30:55] <lunaphyte> i doubt much
[07:31:08] <ih8wndz> hmmm

[13:03:04] <Khepra> can y'all remind me... I _am_ looking through the spec but it's possible I have insufficient levels of coffee in my blood....   if a DKIM sig lists a header but the header is not present in the email ... shouldn't that fail DKIM validation?

[15:18:15] <pj> Khepra: no
[15:19:22] <pj> The DKIM spec allows a non-existing header to be listed, and it basically means that if the header is later added then DKIM will fail.
[15:21:11] <Khepra> Well, makes sense.
[15:22:27] <pj> of course for DKIM to pass then the same header must not have been present at the time the message was signed.
[15:26:16] <Khepra> Well I have an email that passed DKIM validation, but the email has TWO signatures. the spec says two is okay, and the second one lists a header that's not present, so I was wondering if there's any failure going on here, except on the part of the sender who failed to actually include the header.
[15:26:57] <Khepra> perhaps my SpamAssassin failing to DKIM invalidate
[15:29:47] <pj> I would say that the message was signed without the header, so DKIM passed.  If the header is added then DKIM will fail for that signature.
[15:31:24] <pj> And there are scenarios where a sender may wish to do that on purpose, if, for example they want to prevent a reply-to header from being added later on, or a second From: header, etc.
