[00:04:12] <grym> (a pretty traditional view is that a function is a sequence of operations to perform _on_ data; this does not preclude it from also being an object you can pass into other functions!)
[00:04:28] <grym> just like mathematical functions you've played with since middle school

[00:08:40] <bjs> gitesh: look at something like a von Neumann architecture, where you can choose to "read" some memory or "run" some memory:  it doesn't make a distinction between "code" and "data" -at all-.  all code is data and all data is code.

[03:24:20] <lmmx> but really the point is that those 'sentinels' (or whatever they're called) should get converted to a non-optional type ASAP and then you don't need to let that optional propagate
[03:25:18] <lmmx> don't think it is sentinel but I mean when you pass in a None to avoid the bug where an empty list gets reused in repeated function calls etc

[03:57:10] <sybariten> hey hey!
[03:58:26] <sybariten> I'm using the input() function to take in a short string from the user. Or actually, they're writing a year. But they could also add a second argument, and if so i will use that. Any suggestions on how to distinguish between these two inputs from the user, and storing it appropiately?
[03:58:51] <grym> sybariten: write a hacky little parser function
[03:58:59] <bjs> sybariten: what is the second argument?
[03:59:06] <bjs>  and when might they type it?
[03:59:15] <sybariten> For instance, they could answer "2005" and i will use that 2005 to check against an if/else thing, but they could also answer "2005 12" and then i want to use both the 2005 and the 12
[03:59:34] <grym> sybariten: always integers?
[03:59:48] <sartan> this arbitrary format seems like a good use case for https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[03:59:56] <sybariten> actually, for anything that isn't argumen1 = one out of three years, i need to complain, also  (was that understandable?)
[04:00:28] <sartan> it will be able to generate an actual datetime object from all sorts of wacky ways humans type dates in
[04:00:31] <sybariten> basically the user is only allowed to choose between three different years, but he/she may also add an extra integer, to limit the result coming back from a list. More understandable?

[05:57:31] <sybariten> yeah no thats not nitpicky, a hardcoded value like that there looks a bit odd, i agree

[05:57:58] <InPhase> sybariten: Full number of countries is probably not a property of the function, it's a state of the system.  The syntax you're looking for is probably getSortedEmissionList(theYear, numberOfCountries=None):  then inside the function, obtain the total number of countries from somewhere if it is set as None.

[05:59:00] <sybariten> grym:hmmm but should they really be ints? the three years are basically just used to check something in an if/elif clause, to know which dict to look in. If i'm not doing any number manipulation here, isnt 1990 in fact a string just as if i'd have answered "yearA" ?

[06:00:03] <sybariten> InPhase: aha. I will look at that later, thanks. right now i broke the functionality anyhow by trying to introduce an input parser...

[06:01:20] <sybariten> yeah i can see that, in a way. And i'm probably dealing with a type error somewhere right now. But i'll let them be strings for now i think

[11:51:40] <fdan> deniska: unfortunately yes :/   i am trying to dockerize that as well
[11:51:56] <fdan> trying it since 8 hours now :(
[11:52:49] <deniska> fdan: anyway, you have to create passenger_wsgi.py file which imports your flask app object with the name `application`
[11:52:58] <deniska> and put it in www root
[11:53:22] <deniska> (and then also tell your webserver to prohibit access to __pycache__ directory which will be created :\ )
[11:53:28] <fdan> ok i have a file in my repository called as passenger_wsgi.py which has this content 'from app import app as application'
[11:54:02] <fdan> put it in the www root?
[11:54:08] <fdan> could you explain me a bit more
[11:54:39] <deniska> as I said, I used it on the shared hosting, so I'm not sure whether it's passenger or this specific hosting configuration
[11:54:55] <deniska> but I basically had to put this file in /var/www
[11:55:28] <fdan> deniska should i have this file https://dpaste.org/fWmk
[11:55:37] <deniska> Why do you need passenger? Use gunicorn instead, it's much easier to configure
[11:56:01] <fdan> yes that worked for me.. but this is the task that i have got
[11:56:06] <deniska> I only used it because that's what cheapo shared hosting had as a python option :)

[18:32:08] <rendar> well, it must create them (of course), and it must manage the way they "touch" the python objects, with the GIL i suppose, right? then a thread can exit gracfully and CPython is not responsible for that
[18:32:11] <jochum> rendar: what about creating a stream out of that "cpu-intensive" tasks
[18:32:14] *** Joins: matrixbot_bartab (~matrixbot@155.210.31.93.rev.sfr.net)
[18:32:24] <rendar> jochum: a stream out?
[18:32:30] <jochum> rendar: can you split it up?
[18:32:55] <jochum> rendar: stream was wrong word just lots of await yield and stuff
[18:33:07] <sybariten> i have this little thing to parse user input. As you can see it checks values[1] , but i'm not sure that the user will input something that consists of more than one string though. So that check will break then, i take it? Any smart way i could rewrite it, to say somehting like "values[1] if values[1] exists"  ?
[18:33:11] <sybariten> https://bpa.st/Q33A
[18:33:21] <Yhg1s> FKAShinobi: There is no 'l' in my nick. If you want to use Visual Studio, what's stopping you? If you're asking for a different IDE for all those languages at the same time, VSCode is a common answer. It has plenty of support for other languages too, although #python wouldn't be the place to ask about them.
[18:33:36] <jochum> rendar: if you split that "cpu-intensive" task up, you have less blocking, you have more happy customers :)
[18:33:41] <rendar> jochum: you mean in different processes?
[18:33:42] <bjs> sybariten: well you can start by checking len(values), if it's 0 they didn't input anything, if it's 1 they input 1 word, if it's 2 they input 2 words ... etc

[18:33:56] <jochum> rendar: no, same, just yield in between
[18:34:16] <bjs> jochum: rendar has threads, so there is no "yield"
[18:34:31] <bjs> Python is already switching between the two.
[18:34:39] <sybariten> bjs: so there's not "batteries included" shortcut, i need an extra if-check somewhere for that?
[18:34:54] <jochum> bjs: ok, but i read asyncio in the original question?
[18:35:11] <bjs> jochum: the original question was about run_in_executor
[18:35:24] <bjs> which is an asyncio function yes, but what it does is runs the code -in another thread-

[18:35:31] <jochum> bjs: am I telling shit? :)
[18:35:52] <bjs> jochum: no what you say is true and fine I think you just missed the thread part
[18:35:57] <jochum> kk
[18:35:57] <sybariten> maybe i could do soemthing like   elif not len(values) == 2 AND not values[1].isdigit():
[18:36:04] <sybariten> uhhh typi
[18:36:05] <bjs> sybariten: well len() is batteries included, and can do exactly what you want
[18:36:09] <rendar> well, let's say that the OS schedules the thread cpu time, and python can "schedule" the thread through the GIL, because manipulating it it chooses whicih thread can touch py data, right?
[18:36:20] <sybariten>   elif len(values) == 2 AND not values[1].isdigit():
[18:36:28] <bjs> rendar: well all the GIL does is says that if two threads try touch Python objects at the same time, one waits.
[18:37:07] <jochum> rendar: what about an event system to externalize the task?

[18:37:21] <rendar> jochum: yes, maybe that will be the final solution
[18:37:23] <jochum> rendar: like celery
[18:37:26] <bjs> sybariten: you can probably make the if/elif chain nicer by just thinking carefully about the order. Start by checking the len(), and then check the words
[18:38:07] <jochum> rendar: cause the GIL is the GIL, no chance around it.
[18:38:38] <bjs> rendar: what kind of "cpu-intensive" work are you doing? are you using any particular libraries?

[18:43:30] <rendar> bjs: yes! i know that, but it will take time from asyncio thread, hence i want to do those stuff into another thread
[18:43:40] <bjs> rendar: why would it take time from asyncio thread?
[18:43:45] <bjs> if you've put them in their own thread
[18:44:01] <rendar> *if* they were into the same ascynio thread (e.g. main thread)

[18:44:14] <bjs> rendar: ah sure,  but if you say run_in_executor it like you said

[18:45:17] <rendar> yes, it should
[18:45:46] <rendar> but i'm also interested in having asyncio deferring work in subprocesses, to exploit better the multi-cpu
[18:45:46] <bjs> rendar: yes it should be no issue? or yes it should be an issue?
[18:45:57] <rendar> no issue
[18:46:02] <bjs> rendar: well run_in_executor takes the executor as input, you can give it a ProcessPoolExecutor instead
[18:46:08] <bjs> but if the work is numpy it won't help
[18:46:13] <bjs> infact itll probably make it worse

[18:50:36] <rendar> bjs: worse?!? how come?
[18:51:31] * jochum is learning
[18:53:07] <bjs> rendar: they're bigger, they have a lot more overhead, communicating between them is slow
[18:54:43] <rendar> ok
[18:55:09] <rendar> bjs: in linux kernel, the structure of a new process if very close to the structure of a new thread
[18:55:18] <rendar> (if not the same)
[18:55:18] <bjs> rendar: but with a *huge* amount of overhead

[18:55:41] <rendar> yeah, linux changes only some _clone() syscall flag
[18:55:53] <bjs> rendar: if you use fork, you have to copy the entire process over. If you use spawn you have to run the entire program again up to that point to do the computation again
[18:55:54] <rendar> but those flags can be fatal, e.g. CopyOnWrite flag
[18:56:04] *** Joins: tmart (~tmart@47-220-53-233.gtwncmkt04.res.dyn.suddenlink.net)
[18:56:28] <bjs> and then communicating between them is very expensive,  and so for numpy you'll definitely need to manually allocate some shared memory buffers to use
[18:56:51] <bjs> and all this might be for nothing as there might not be very much to gain over a thread in this case

[19:22:39] <sybariten> OK i know this is all a bit vague information before i show code and errors, but just a quick question. I can do this : getSortedEmissionList(2005, 8)  which works with a fucntion i have,   and i have a variable theYear that looks like this , print(theYear) --> ['2005', '8']    and i can do this    print(", ".join(theYear))   --->  2005, 8    which, to me, looks very much like what i was manually
[19:22:41] <sybariten> feeding into that function before. Yet i can't do   getSortedEmissionList(", ".join(theYear))    cause then i run into some secondary errors related to , im sure, data typing...

[20:34:19] <luvalon1> but somehow the last file.write doesnt work, it stays without the stuff from the variable htmlend... the strange part is, it adds the stuff from html start
[20:34:43] <luvalon1> can someone explain to me why? and how to fix? I even put print(htmlend) before and it prints, yet it doesnt write it to the file...
[20:34:58] <ChrisWarrick> luvalon1: are you sure that htmlend is not blank? Also, you might want to use a templating language, eg. jinja2, instead of constructig html by hand like this
[20:35:20] <luvalon1> yes I am because I did the print before the write
[20:35:35] <luvalon1> and its just for one page that is just for me, but I cant get why it doesnt add it...
[20:36:12] <ChrisWarrick> luvalon1: pastebin full code?

[20:37:43] <luvalon1> Im sorry for asking the question. Jesus, I even triplechecked, but I had a typo that made it write to a different file and I always read the one where the html end wasnt written to yet.. Thanks ChrisWarrick

[21:06:12] <ldm> Structuring applications in Flask seems to be easier if Flask() is instantiated in a global scope fairly early on; this allows a lot of decorators to be used.
[21:06:12] <ldm> My question is, if the app is instantiated globally, then how could you structure a module so that you could pass parameters to the constructor without using global scope?
[21:06:12] <ldm> If you've got an entry point __main__.py, and __init__.py calls Flask(), then as soon as __main__.py imports the package (__init__.py) then __init__.py will create the app.

[21:09:44] <jochum> ldm: your last sentence explains waht you want?
[21:09:50] <ldm> so for me it's a static / live site generator, where main does argparse to figure out the templates/ and static/ directory for Flask. Once it's got those, it can pass them to init which creates the app, then imports other submodules (eg .routes) which import the created app, and use (eg) app.route to setup various parts. I'm aware of Blueprints, bu
[21:09:50] <ldm> t the problem remains that the parameters would have to be in the global scope.
[21:11:02] <ldm> jochum: once __main__.py imports __init__.py, there's no scope for __main__ to set a variable in __init__ because it will start executing; since Flask behaves best in the global scope, it will create app = Flask() before the end of `import .`

[22:47:01] <j00n> ChrisWarrick: I forgot to mention that I need to add 0-byte after each char for line 6.

[22:47:38] <j00n> ChrisWarrick: How can I do this then?
[22:47:53] <bjs> nesoi: I'm not really sure "by-reference" or "by-value" really mean much in Python world because Python variables don't work like other languages variables do. See bit.ly/pynames1 for an explanation
[22:47:54] <ChrisWarrick> j00n: do you really need 0x00 or is it really utf-16?
[22:48:05] <bjs> nesoi: are you seeing some behaviour you are trying to explain?  Perhaps it's easier just to explain it directly
[22:48:14] <j00n> ChrisWarrick: It's a null-byte based on the .pcap I got.
[22:48:23] <j00n> ChrisWarrick: Windows :)
[22:48:24] <asa22> @bjs it divides numbers by 2,3,4,5...20 starting at 20 and increasing by 1 until it finds a number thats evenly divisible by 1,2,3,4...20 then prints it
[22:48:29] <j00n> ChrisWarrick: e.g. wide-char
[22:48:52] <nesoi> bjs: in computer science, passing by reference means that a pointer to the variable is passed. Passing by value means that the contents of the variable are copied.
[22:48:53] <ChrisWarrick> j00n: then use s.encode('utf-16le')
[22:49:07] <bjs> nesoi: I know what that phrase means, I'm saying that variables don't work that way in Python
[22:49:16] <bjs> nesoi: a Python variable isn't like a little chunk of memory like it is in C.

[22:50:31] <bjs> nesoi: it doesn't really make sense to say that though because you don't do either to the contents of the variable, because a variable isn't a little chunk of memory you can take a reference to.  Instead variables are just tags/names for objects and those objects are what are passed (by reference)
[22:50:37] <bjs> nesoi: it won't be copied
[22:50:48] <j00n> ChrisWarrick: Perfect, works. Although I see some garbage at the end. But it works at least. :) Thanks again
[22:51:34] <nesoi> thanks, that's the answer I need :)
[22:52:22] <nesoi> next question: If I want to load a dozen files of about 15MB each into dicts, what's the fastest way to do that? And if I always need to load the same files into dicts is there a way of saving them in some format that would load them all faster?

[22:55:35] <nesoi> bjs: I think that could be slower than what I'm doing because I actually only need the first column of each row
[22:55:53] <asa22> bjs should run as many times as the variable number is increased by 1

[22:56:40] <nesoi> for row in reader:
[22:56:40] <nesoi>            dict_from_csv.add(row[1])
[22:56:48] <asa22> oh wait, little lightbulb appeared in my mind
[22:56:56] <bjs> asa22: it looks like your loop starts with i=2,n=20, then since 20 is  divisible by 2 you go to i=3,n=20. but 20 is not divislbe by 3,  so you go to i=3,n=21, which is, then i=4,n=21 up to i=4,n=26 ... is this right?  that's what your code says
[22:57:00] <bjs> but something isn't quite right
[22:57:18] <bjs> up to 24 sorry, I can't count
[22:57:24] <asa22> the i should be resetting but it isnt
[22:57:32] <asa22> thats the issue I think
[22:57:33] <bjs> asa22: ah,  maybe you want a `for` loop?
[22:57:35] <bjs> to count
[22:57:47] <nesoi> actually the 2nd column :)
[22:58:15] <bjs> nesoi: what I mean is that csv files are text files.  Text files aren't structured (even if the contents -look- structured) you just have to loop over them from the first character to the last
[22:58:26] *** Joins: IgIgOrzoy (~IgIgOrzoy@5.142.207.202)
[22:58:44] <bjs> nesoi: so pulling out a particular column is not very efficient and probably csv is the best you're going to get without changing the format (to e.g., some kind of fixed-size record thing, or a proper database)
[22:59:08] <nesoi> these input files could be any format really
[22:59:22] <nesoi> what would be most efficient to get into dicts?
[23:00:26] <nesoi> could put them in a db, but not sure that reading 100M rows from a db is actually going to be faster
[23:00:34] <bjs> nesoi: it's not really about the "into dicts" part, that part is basically irrelevant the part that matters is getting the data (in whatever form) *out* of the file
[23:00:47] <bjs> nesoi: I mean currently a csv file is basically the worst way to format this, so it can't be any worse :P

[23:02:22] <bjs> nesoi: it really depends what the contents are and how much more efficient you need to be. I'm sure the "most" efficient way is some horrible complicated custom format with fixed-width binary format that lets you pull out Row I Column J directly or something.
[23:02:42] <bjs> Obviously it also depends on the length of the row, if the row is short compared to the column then you're not gonna save much by avoiding to read it
[23:02:56] <bjs> but if your rows are each MBs and you only want a few bytes from each... that's a whole different story
