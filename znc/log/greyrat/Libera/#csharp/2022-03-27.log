[00:00:46] <Tazy> Hi all, if you have a JsonElement, how do you replace a value in it?
[00:04:04] <Suchiman> Tazy: System.Text.Json.JsonDocument?
[00:04:10] <Suchiman> Tazy: that is read only
[00:04:44] <Tazy> JsonDocument is readOnly?
[00:05:46] <Tazy> is newtonsoft better for this >?
[00:09:19] <bomb> you keep asking this for months
[00:09:36] <bomb> just move on already Tazy
[00:10:15] <Tazy> No I am doing something personal for, thought I would use System.Text.Json, cause I wanna clean up some json, but getting stuck , and I am on .Net6
[00:10:58] <Tazy> Oh, I see now, awh man, okay back to newtonsoft
[00:11:11] <bomb> just use the newtonsoft one then. that's what Suchiman always uses
[00:11:24] <Tazy> bomb, but I did hear at my old job, that the stuff I did with System.Text.Json did speed up things a lot
[00:11:47] <bomb> who cares Tazy I said Suchu uses newtonsoft
[00:11:52] <bomb> do we need to know anything else?
[00:12:05] <Tazy> lol
[00:12:15] <Tazy> I am installing the nuget
[00:12:40] <bomb> congrats :)
[00:12:42] <Suchiman> Tazy: manipulating json with JObject is more inefficient than straight serialization anyway so...
[00:13:51] <Tazy> Suchiman, you mean deserialize to a class , and then serialize that?
[00:14:01] <Tazy> is that faster
[00:14:29] <Suchiman> Tazy: i think so but not entirely sure, lemme benchmark that
[00:14:53] <Tazy> Otherwise I will create the classes needed and just deserialize and change what I need to
[00:17:25] <Tazy> well I have a 100mb file to parse, so gonna be fun :p
[00:17:32] <bpmedley> Tazy : Would JsonPatchDocument help at all?
[00:18:34] <Tazy> I don't have aspnetcore with this
[00:18:34] <bomb> 100 MB of JSON is what newspaper websites send to the browser for each article these days
[00:22:26] <Suchiman> Tazy: https://gist.github.com/Suchiman/b5cc5b9fe924ca99c35726c95ce4d591
[00:23:22] <Tazy> o.0
[00:23:28] <Tazy> well that is a major difference
[00:23:53] <Tazy> I didn't want to create the whole class structure, but maybe a json => C# class tool can help
[00:24:07] <Suchiman> Tazy: another thing you could do would be using Utf8JsonReader and Utf8JsonWriter, read the json, check if you're looking at the thing you want to modify, if not, pass the read value through to the writer, otherwise write the modified value with the writer
[00:24:28] <Tazy> Hmmm that could work
[00:24:41] <Tazy> Cause I only want to go delete entries from an array in a json structure
[00:28:36] <bpmedley> Tazy : https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch/6.0.3  <-- You can just grab the nuget directly

[00:36:20] <bomb> nobody talks about WinForms or WPF anymore. they're all about server-side now
[00:37:09] <Lizard_> mmm I just kind of unloaded the management interface when I ported to net5.0, kind of curious to see how it will go to run that in GTK+?
[00:38:05] <Lizard_> I assume that when it works on windows on 5 it will also Just Work™
[00:38:40] <Lizard_> still running that part in 4.6 or something like that

[02:59:24] <JakeSays> i do contracting work for nintendo
[03:00:45] <MatthiasVance> Oh fun, so because of embedded stuff or actual games?
[03:01:10] <JakeSays> embedded stuff.

[03:09:45] <JakeSays> they want to be a carter
[03:11:00] <JakeSays> we did that here back in the 70's. i dont think it helped
[03:11:16] <edcba> better solution, don't drive, walk !
[03:11:28] <edcba> sleep at work !
[03:11:31] <JakeSays> i walk to and from work every day
[03:11:45] <Nasp> There's no way you ca ndrive 130 to work anyway
[03:13:43] <JakeSays> so biden proposed a new minimum tax on anyone worth more than $100MM: 20%. wtf
[03:14:24] <edcba> tax on capital ?
[03:15:20] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Income tax or capital gain tax or capital tax
[03:15:39] <edcba> income maybe lol
[03:15:57] <MatthiasVance> We have 37% and 49.5% =/
[03:16:42] <JakeSays> it looks like it's designed to target anything that produces income from any source, so if you borrow money against a stock portfolio you'll have to pay a tax on the amount you borrowed, etc.
[03:16:52] <edcba> i wonder what is the max income in US
[03:17:27] <JakeSays> edcba: max income? there's no upper limit. lol
[03:18:17] <edcba> well that's pretty inefficient then
[03:18:45] <JakeSays> i assume you mean income tax, not income
[03:19:16] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: so i think it's more of a capital tax
[03:19:44] <JakeSays> but i'm only ~100MM short of being affected by it
[03:22:31] <Nasp> JakeSays: 20%?
[03:22:43] <JakeSays> yeah
[03:22:51] <Nasp> For capital and not income?
[03:22:56] <JakeSays> which doesn't sound like much, but it's better than 0%
[03:23:06] <Nasp> It sounds like a lot to me
[03:23:29] <JakeSays> Nasp: well, i'm not entirely sure. the article didn't go in to much detail
[03:23:31] <Nasp> Oh well they would still have money like shit
[03:23:40] <Nasp> I think we should tax big corporations
[03:23:44] <Nasp> all of them are cheating and we all know if
[03:23:46] <JakeSays> but it sounds like it's designed to plug some huge loopholes
[03:24:40] <JakeSays> all i know is in the 1950's 50% of the wealth in this country was in the hands of the middle class. today it's 17% and falling.
[03:30:54] <MatthiasVance> So how are you going to make back that 20% yearly?
[03:31:09] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: what do you mean?//////
[03:31:12] <JakeSays> bah
[03:31:22] <JakeSays> i seriously need to fix my kbd
[03:31:40] <MatthiasVance> So it's probably capital *gain* tax then
[03:32:06] <JakeSays> no
[03:32:14] <MatthiasVance> Oh, how does it work then!
[03:33:50] <JakeSays> well, as i said above, it looks like it's designed to tax any income from capital, not just gain. so if you borrow $100 against your stock portfolio, you'll pay $20 in taxes on that loan.

[03:49:18] <edcba> % ?
[03:49:42] <Nasp> If it's more than 100MM
[03:49:59] <JakeSays> edcba: only if you borrow against an investment portfolio
[03:50:30] <JakeSays> that's how the super rich get around paying taxes
[03:51:55] <edcba> ok
[03:52:37] <Nasp> Or for companies "Ohh no we just got a huge bill that was exactly all our profits"

[03:52:49] <Nasp> "..."

[05:23:44] <JakeSays> Suchiman: how close is that to the musl version?
[05:30:56] <Suchiman> JakeSays: looks good to me, although I'd use out instead of ref
[05:32:09] <JakeSays> Suchiman: yeah i thought about that, but in the C version there is a spot where the result is returned w/o setting e
[05:32:14] <JakeSays> so i kept that behavior
[05:33:14] <JakeSays> i'm about 99% sure out would work
[05:34:14] <JakeSays> lol the dec64 code i'm porting passes in an uninitialized int
[05:35:07] <Suchiman> JakeSays well yeah that is kinda undefined behavior and in c# you're required to init the variable which will likely be 0, either by the caller (in the case of red or the callee in the case of out)
[05:35:31] <JakeSays> yes i know.
[05:36:11] <JakeSays> my original thinking was to maintain the integrity of the C api, but i think the musl implementation has a bug in it
[05:36:34] <JakeSays> but the dec64 code i'm porting definitely has a bug in it

[05:48:35] <JakeSays> Suchiman: now find a c# solution to __builtin_mul_overflow :D
[05:51:28] <Suchiman> JakeSays: checked(a*b)
[05:51:47] <JakeSays> Suchiman: that throws on overflow?
[05:51:53] <Suchiman> Yes
[05:52:45] <JakeSays> i'm currently using Math.BigMul() and checking if the return value > 0
[05:53:15] <JakeSays> i wonder if check() would be slower in the common case
[05:53:20] <JakeSays> er, no overflow case
[05:53:29] <JakeSays> and faster, not slower

[16:22:55] <bpmedley> martin__-- : I've experience some odd things with the latest MAUI preview and some 3rd party widgets.  For example, a dropdown does not work nor does a popup.
[16:23:02] <bpmedley> This is on macOS
[16:23:34] <bpmedley> However, before the latest preview, I could not build on macOS.  So things are improving
[16:26:31] <martin__--> bpmedley imho maui is still not useable for me. I'm experimenting with very basic things, which is either not working or doesn't exist yet :( Not sure if they can release a version until summer
[16:26:57] <bpmedley> martin__-- : Yeah, I'm very grateful it's being worked on and glad they are waiting on quality.
[16:27:05] <bpmedley> So, I agree with you
[16:27:20] <martin__--> I use mainly the windows platform so maybe things are better on android?

[16:28:13] <martin__--> oh okay :O

[21:22:35] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah, custom 3V lithium cells that lasted 6 weeks
[21:22:50] <Nasp> Well if you run out you always have the manual way
[21:23:01] <Nasp> But still sounsd more secure to just use standard A* batteries
[21:26:42] <irwiss> https://i.redd.it/nonv4kpavxp81.png
[21:27:01] <Suchiman> Nasp: i'd post you a picture of the battery but there's literally none :P https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.qu9HGr1mp0jXZW7qBSqkXAHaDI?pid=ImgDet&rs=1
[21:27:14] <Suchiman> that's my old pump that had a proprietary battery
[21:27:34] <Nasp> Ohh
[21:27:45] <Nasp> My nieces husbands made those pumps year ago
[21:27:56] <Nasp> But now only work with insulin factories
[21:28:05] <irwiss> can't you just solder a proper battery instead or it has some DRM on it?
[21:28:14] <Nasp> Then they probably give no guarantees
[21:29:13] <Suchiman> irwiss: solder a battery?
[21:29:33] <Nasp> I thnk he means a battery connector
[21:29:38] <Nasp> So you can use whatever battery you like
[21:29:48] <irwiss> open it up, solder contacts to where the proprietary battery goes and use whatever battery you want
[21:29:50] <irwiss> yeah
[21:30:15] <Suchiman> irwiss: i mean i suppose but that would make the pump not so water proof xD
[21:30:40] <Nasp> Also Suchiman  Is a Cyborg
[21:31:10] <Suchiman> irwiss: and very much break warranty xD especially since they wanted to have the pump back after 2 years xD
[21:31:43] <irwiss> ah i thought it was device with 6 weeks of "life"
[21:32:15] <Suchiman> irwiss: no, it just means that only the manufacturer of the pump would be able to deliver fitting batteries
[21:33:01] <Suchiman> irwiss: but then again, i always got the batteries via prescription for free from the manufacturer so not a huge deal
