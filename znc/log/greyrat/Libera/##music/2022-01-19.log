[00:14:45] <sublim20> i saw the worst magician last time.  the worst.  midway through his act, the 'hidden' duck appeared, 
[00:15:05] <sublim20> and he just shrugged his shoulders and moved on.  half the show was just clips of him on letterman,  it was embarrasssing
[00:15:41] <sublim20> but i'll just play poker
[00:15:50] <sublim20> hopefully earn enough at the tables to pay for the trip
[00:16:58] <louipc> hahaha
[00:17:02] <louipc> did u get a refund
[00:17:10] <louipc> or least a free steak and lobster
[00:17:17] <sublim20> no.  i just accepted it was a life lesson and moved on
[00:18:10] <sublim20> this wasn't recent letterman either
[00:18:26] <sublim20> it had that grainy, vhs quality from the mid 90s
[00:18:42] <sublim20> dudes just been coasting on that one letterman appearance for like 20 years i guess
[00:20:05] <louipc> haha sad
[00:20:29] <louipc> maybe forgot how to do the trick
[00:21:36] <sublim20> no, this guy must have had a residency, aka, can't get fired as long as he shows up and does the show
[00:21:49] <sublim20> it was a masterclass on not giving a fuck
[00:21:56] <DOMF> <murthy> DOMF: back with that story again?   <murthy> mod double standards <-- I mean obvs not just something I'm making up if multiple other users are complaining about it :p
[00:21:57] <sublim20> honestly, if he's still there, i'll go again and record it for ya
[00:22:40] <sublim20> but vegas has legal weed now, and flights are stupidly cheap

[00:27:30] <louipc> not the place for that
[00:27:33] <DOMF> he didn't "warn" you about me in PM, he did it in here for everyone to see

[00:29:01] <DOMF> I will, with the pretty pissed-off-note at this point that I'm repeatedly harassed by a single mod about my politics, and then am constantly asked to be the "better person" and stop talking about it in here

[00:44:43] <murthy> depends on the chocolate to corn ratio

[00:48:29] <Janet> (REDIRECT) ^ Steve Hackett - Supper's Ready - YouTube
[00:48:32] <murthy> whats that scale
[00:50:35] <DOMF> the starting one is just a natural minor
[00:51:19] <murthy> Like C one?
[00:51:43] <louipc> oh lol murthy are u asking for scale of song or scale of instrument
[00:52:00] <murthy> I came to know from wiki that C is in the middle in terms of size and D is the largest one in case of flutes
[00:52:09] <murthy> louipc: instrument, flute
[00:52:24] <murthy> oops
[00:52:34] <murthy> DOMF: I am just asking about the flute
[00:52:43] <murthy> in that particular part of the song
[00:52:46] <louipc> lol you can't necessarily tell murthy
[00:53:03] <murthy> ok
[00:53:08] <louipc> remember i said u need to know about flutes, and need a close view of the fingerings to tell instrument scale
[00:53:26] <murthy> Its little confusing. So ear training is just to tell the notes?
[00:53:33] <murthy> not chords and scales?
[00:53:56] <louipc> ear training is all kinds of stuff
[00:53:56] <macrobat> if you hear one note, what scale is it in?
[00:54:05] <murthy> no scale?
[00:54:19] <murthy> no wait
[00:54:24] <louipc> ear training really should be developing "relative pitch"
[00:54:41] <murthy> I think there are like 4 scales in a piano right?
[00:55:14] <louipc> if you have relative pitch then you can tell relative scale if given a reference note
[00:55:28] <murthy> louipc: ya thats what I mean, so if you fully listen to a music piece you could find the scale right?
[00:55:34] <louipc> few people have developed perfect pitch
[00:55:36] <murthy> ah yes
[00:55:54] <murthy> Here the music people are so perfect
[00:56:06] <murthy> people get scolded harshly for doing mistakes
[00:56:12] <louipc> you can tell if the music is minor or major or whatever
[00:56:20] <murthy> ya
[00:56:22] <louipc> you can tell the modes and the key changes
[00:56:36] <murthy> ya
[00:56:44] <louipc> KEY is the better term here
[00:56:51] <louipc> rather than scale i guess
[00:56:53] <murthy> I came to know about the lydian mode recently
[00:57:04] <louipc> cool

[04:24:02] <murthy> audiobirb: same
[04:24:24] <murthy> audiobirb: hey you came in my dream few weeks back
[04:24:30] <murthy> more like a week back
[04:24:48] <audiobirb> lol cool, what was your dream about
[04:24:52] <audiobirb> hope it wasn't a bad dream
[04:24:56] <murthy> we were hanging out and listening to some nice music
[04:25:28] <murthy> then after some time it turned into a gun fight been us and some people idk who
[04:25:54] <audiobirb> lol wth
[04:26:09] <audiobirb> well at least we were listening to nice music
[04:26:13] <audiobirb> before it anyway
[04:26:53] <murthy> oh ya, I woke up and felt why would someone ruin such a nice time
[04:28:04] <murthy> audiobirb: A troll got banned here, I think that triggered the dream
[04:28:29] <murthy> audiobirb: It was like hanging out with my college friends, felt like college days
[04:28:38] <murthy> audiobirb: You music is very nice
[04:28:53] <murthy> audiobirb: I feel the beat is similar
[04:29:02] <murthy> let the find the similar one of yours
[04:29:13] <murthy> also let me take another listen
[04:30:27] <murthy> may be slightly like "Avoid the ice"
[04:30:36] <audiobirb> yea it is
[04:30:37] <murthy> idk let me take another listen
[04:31:00] <audiobirb> all the drum beats are quite similar, but on this one the main cymbal is the ride, not the hihat
[04:31:06] <audiobirb> more jazzy
[04:31:34] <murthy> audiobirb: If this is going into the same album then there is nothing to think about
[04:31:57] <murthy> audiobirb: also this one is very different and very nice
[04:32:14] <murthy> in a sense from the way you usually do
[04:32:25] <audiobirb> thanks! i think it'll sound a lot better even, once it's mixed and mastered
[04:32:34] <audiobirb> it's quite raw as it is
[04:33:00] <murthy>  The stereo doubling at 1:02 is nice
[04:33:09] <murthy> audiobirb: indeed

[04:47:11] <hstl> Before that - it's a thriller movie about bandits and hostages
[04:47:38] <zenema> Hah, that sounds about right! I should probably watch it again, memory of it is pretty faded.

[08:33:29] <morf> Hot was supposed to succumb to Covid-19 on Sunday, which she intentionally infected so she wouldn't have to get vaccinated. On Friday, January 14, the singer informed her friends that she was a "foreman" (this doesn't translate ... meaning someone who went through covid) and would soon be able to go to the theaters or the sauna.
[08:33:33] <morf> lol
[08:33:43] <morf> hot = horka (her name)
[08:35:52] <morf> anyway omicron came here before last week it was 50% of cases, last week 80% cases ... the number of cases tripled in a week ... but hospitalization numbers keep going down (which is good) 
[08:36:21] <morf> i hope it will mutate again to something that doesn't get you to hospital ever and we will be done with this stupid coivd shit

[20:33:19] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: People here said that wood one would crack on humidity and also needs some maintenance from time to time. Also it is my first music that I was buying so I wanted it to last forever. I am yet to buy a G natural scale and a D scale one, if my neighbours don't complain then will buy those as a wooden handmade one.
[20:33:55] <murthy> rindolf: hi
[20:34:29] <rindolf> murthy: hi

[20:36:57] <murthy> It seems the cost of the flute is directly related the perfection of tuning it
[20:37:10] <louipc> you often see players tiltind down the instrument. blowing on it while making no sound
[20:37:11] <murthy> the costly ones are studio grade tuned

[22:14:58] <DOMF>   <artao> so you'd get yer money back? <-- yes

[22:15:16] <artao> AH mk
[22:15:27] <artao> pretty much every cultural all over the planet came up with flutes like that
[22:15:36] <artao> they're fun. i have a chinese version, dizi
[22:15:58] <murthy> artao: nice
[22:15:59] <DOMF> I mean I don't know if I AM going to the concert that's why I bought insurance 
[22:16:21] <murthy> artao: When I get a little bit good with the Indian flute I will buy a western concert one
[22:16:24] <artao> interesting that the bansuri is 6 hole, like all the others
[22:16:43] <artao> Indian music has a much moer complicated musical scale .... no, not "complicated"
[22:16:46] <artao> more notes
[22:16:53] <murthy> artao: oh I don't think so
[22:17:00] <artao> pretty sure a 6 hole transverse flute can hit em all
[22:17:02] <artao> oh, it does
[22:17:03] <murthy> artao: there is variety from 5 to 8 holes
[22:17:28] <artao> indian music is more like 1/4 tone per note rather than the western 1/2 tone per note

[22:17:54] <artao> i did :)
[22:18:07] <artao> enjoy! 
[22:18:31] <murthy> artao: how many holes do you see?
[22:18:47] <murthy> Panther: yes!
[22:18:49] <artao> 6
[22:19:07] <artao> well .... not including the one you blow in and the one at the bottom ... which i've never been sure what that one is for
[22:19:08] <Panther> murthy, you like this song?
[22:19:14] <murthy> artao: don't you see the air hole?
[22:19:15] <Panther> Did you like the last one?
[22:19:19] <murthy> artao: also the magenta hole?
[22:19:21] <artao> you only finger 6 of the holes, which is all i'm counting
[22:19:34] <murthy> Panther: are you kidding me, who wouldn't
[22:19:39] <Panther> hehe
[22:19:39] <artao> *all that gets counted
[22:19:48] <murthy> Panther: ya all nice song
[22:20:08] <artao> my dizi has 4 holes on the bottom. two on top and two on the underside
[22:20:31] <artao> covering them all up does nothing
[22:20:55] <artao> and pretty much all flutes of this style have at least one hole on the bottom like that
[22:20:58] <artao> weird
[22:21:41] <murthy> artao: what is that magenta hole for, output?
[22:21:49] <murthy> I know air is the input
[22:22:02] <artao> i call that cyan, not magenta
[22:22:04] <artao> magenta is red
[22:22:15] <artao> and that's the one i'm talking about. i have no idea what it's for
[22:22:26] <murthy> oh ya sorry cyan
[22:22:40] <artao> pretty much all flutes of this style have at least one of those, but even if you cover them it makes no difference
[22:22:49] <artao> mine has two there
[22:22:57] <artao> covering them does nothing
[22:23:00] <murthy> so its basically the combination of opening and closing of these 6 holes produce the 8 notes
[22:23:09] <artao> correct. plus how hard you blow
[22:23:16] <murthy> c d e f g a b
[22:23:21] <artao> and the angle of your lips when you blow
[22:23:30] <murthy> artao: also accents
[22:23:41] <artao> don't get too frustrated trying to simply get a note out of it at first. takes awhile to find exactly where and how to hold your lips
[22:23:44] <zenema> All this music talk is getting a bit saucy.
[22:24:08] <artao> you can also 1/2 open some of the holes. which is pretty hard really to get a decent tone out of
[22:24:10] <artao> zenema lol
[22:24:11] <artao> :P
[22:24:22] <zenema> :D
[22:24:52] <artao> wow. there is a WIDE array of sizes :O
[22:24:56] <murthy> artao: ya. so when you open a half open a hole, what we get?

[22:38:39] <artao> power both the nts-1 and the craftsynth off it
[22:38:40] <murthy> sound fonts?
[22:38:41] <louipc> yea hook up a portable powerpack
[22:38:53] <artao> murthy ... well ... I mean .. you'd have to play it
[22:39:32] <artao> but yeah. it'll trigger any sound you hook up to it
[22:39:34] <murthy> artao: can you use the computer as a synth along with akai mpk mini and so live
[22:39:39] <artao> yes
[22:39:43] <artao> that's what it's for
[22:39:45] <louipc> independent56: maybe find it at a library and take extensive notes ;)
[22:39:55] <independent56> Or photographs :p
[22:40:06] <murthy> artao: so a dj can use a laptop and akai mini and perform live?
[22:40:08] <louipc> :p
[22:40:12] <artao> computer as synth and/or hardware synths .... tho idk what that model has for MIDI out. might only be USB MIDI
[22:40:17] <artao> murthy yes
[22:40:22] <murthy> nice!
[22:40:43] <independent56> But is there a wiki, like a free, online source of knowladge? Because if there isn't, i might as well make one myself.
[22:40:46] <murthy> I think I am saved from my neighbours
[22:40:54] <murthy> will use headphones

[22:42:57] <louipc> independent56: i dont know of anything, but i'm no composer
[22:42:59] <independent56> I think it would.
[22:43:01] <artao> workstation synth 
[22:43:24] <louipc> independent56: do you use any software for composing?
[22:43:30] <independent56> I actually operate a webserver, so it would be quite easy to install the software. Give it a few days, and it willbe web-facing
[22:43:45] <independent56> I used to compose on LMMS, but i have move to MuseScore
[22:43:59] <independent56> It's great!
[22:44:07] <zenema> Aww man, I need to stop looking at synths! :]

[22:45:16] <independent56> yeah, that's what i am going to do.
[22:45:17] <artao> wait no ... not a workstation?
[22:45:23] <artao> wow. sure looks like one LOL
[22:45:26] <murthy> I guarantee that one of those top end workstation synth is going to be in my hall someday
[22:46:15] <artao> cool
[22:46:30] <independent56> I use tiddlywiki for making notes, MuseScore for writing notes, and email to share the composistions
[22:46:31] <artao> my dad has a Korg Trinity that i'll get ... someday
[22:46:46] <artao> he sure never uses it. grandkids now and then
[22:46:47] <murthy> artao: awesome
[22:47:23] <artao> and it needs some work. hitting keys and using aftertouch will sometimes alter unrelated parameters or even simply switch sounds LOL
[22:47:35] <murthy> artao: https://youtu.be/304NmznmlIo?t=424
[22:47:41] <murthy> that sounds very nice
[22:47:43] <Janet> (REDIRECT) ^ Yamaha Montage [Demo] | No Talking | - YouTube
[22:47:59] <artao> it's a good unit. their flagship synth
[22:49:09] <independent56> Why is the string section so boring? It's literally just different sizes of the same instrument. The cello is a bass violin, the viola an alto, and the bass a contrabass violin.
[22:49:12] <louipc> independent56: you might find better advice on composing on those composer webforums or something
[22:49:25] <murthy> artao: oh thats why it sounds nice
[22:49:27] <louipc> but looks like its mostly in books and each instrument has their own book
[22:50:54] <artao> orchestrac composition is a very academic thing. taught in universities
[22:51:13] <artao> prolly why the books are so expensive. the work "academic" increases their cost like 3x LOL
[22:51:28] <artao> i.e. textbooks
[22:51:37] <artao> over expensive across the board. all of em
[22:51:50] <artao> used market is whrere to get em cheaper. i.e. reasonably priced
[22:52:08] <artao> *orchestral ... not orchestrac lol
[22:53:10] <louipc> yea you would be doing the world a service with a wiki
[22:53:35] <louipc> maybe you can make commissions if you link back to reference books ;)
[22:53:39] <artao> independent56 you making classical music?
[22:53:51] <independent56> Yes, i enjoy creating classical music
[22:54:02] <murthy> for first year its not an option in college
[22:54:05] <independent56> But i enjoy changing the ensamble, like adding harmonicas or removing violas
[22:54:24] <artao> righto
[22:54:29] <murthy> college collects money along with the fees and give the books
[22:54:36] <artao> harmoica would sound weird n classical music LOL
[22:54:58] <artao> murthy more like colleges have agreements with academic book publishers ...
[22:55:05] <murthy> indeed
[22:55:16] <artao> some people have attempted to address the issue with laws. so far unsuccessfully
[22:55:29] <artao> virtually racketeering
[22:56:06] <artao> independent56 chromatic harmoica would work best i imagine
[22:56:10] <murthy> not virtually, literally
[22:56:13] <artao> HARD to play, i tell you what
[22:56:19] <louipc> classical needs more harmonicas and digeridoos
[22:56:26] <artao> lol
[22:56:27] <independent56> I mean, the harmonica is a bit like old trumpets in that it's set to one key or something
[22:56:31] <louipc> and kazoos and vuvuzelas
[22:56:37] <artao> ah. right
[22:56:45] <murthy> this reminds me that I need to buy a nice flute/music tutorial book
[22:56:54] <artao> most harmoicas are key specific. yes. almost entirely diatonic
[22:56:59] <murthy> I mean from the upcoming book fare
[22:57:15] <artao> chromatic harmonicas are the full chromatic scale tho
[22:57:21] <murthy> I will try to get some nice music theory books
[22:57:22] <artao> and they have a button you have to press to switch notes
[22:57:34] <murthy> artao: lumatones
[22:57:41] <artao> and they're huge
[22:57:50] <artao> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_harmonica
[22:57:50] <Janet> ^ The chromatic harmonica is a type of harmonica that uses a button-activated sliding bar to redirect air from the hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate desired. When the button is not pressed, an altered diatonic major scale...
[22:58:04] <artao> i have one, but the comb is cracked :(
[22:58:15] <artao> and i can't play it for shit lol
[22:58:17] <DOMF> I have a dual key harmonica
[22:58:23] <DOMF> one side C one side G
[22:58:26] <artao> i can rock some blues harp tho

[23:11:59] <artao> and yeah. just your standard harmoica is 40 to 50 bucks. they ain't cheap
[23:12:17] <artao> that's why i only have one (working) one
[23:13:32] <artao> .... which i need to clean. it's full of cigarette ash :(
[23:14:13] <artao> Fun Fact: Howlin' Wolf liked to soak his harmoicas in whiskey. He played Hohner Blues harps
[23:14:24] <artao> they have a wooden comb (as do most harmonicas)
[23:14:56] <artao> over time, the wood absorbs moisture from playing it and "tightens up," making it louder, more full-toned, and easier to bend
[23:15:22] <artao> so, obviously, soaking them in any liquid speeds that up
[23:15:35] <artao> but GAD! i can't imagine playing a harp that tastes like whiskey. i'd puke
[23:16:35] <artao> and if freshly soaked, it'd prolly get you drunk from breathing evaporating alcohol LOL
[23:16:48] <louipc> oh thought they mostly have metal
[23:17:06] <artao> the reeds and reed plate are metal, but the comb is wood
[23:17:19] <artao> some have plastic combs, like Lee Oskar. they start out nice and tight
[23:17:29] <artao> but also some super cheap shitty ones
[23:17:37] <louipc> oh plastic then :p
[23:17:43] <louipc> i wonder which i have
[23:17:56] <artao> reeds and reed plates are generally brass
[23:19:12] <louipc> i have a suzuki folkmaster
[23:19:34] <artao> :O
[23:19:39] <artao> i didn't even know they made harps
[23:20:29] <louipc> japanese make good stuff
[23:20:32] <artao> looks like wood comb
[23:20:39] <artao> or wood-pattern plastic
[23:20:46] <louipc> one i have is plastic for sure
[23:21:53] <louipc> moisture in wood doesnt seem like a good idea but maybe i was wrong
[23:21:58] <artao> ah. "Moulded plastic waterproof body" ........ which means the comb
[23:22:04] <louipc> maybe murthy should soak his flute in whiskey
[23:22:11] <artao> pretty well reviewed it looks like
[23:22:13] <artao> :D
[23:22:46] <artao> yeah, you usually don't want moisture in wood
[23:23:02] <artao> but there's lots of things where it's good too. like harmoicas and barrels
[23:23:29] <louipc> and definitely not in plywood or other /fake/ woods
[23:23:32] <artao> perhaps even wood ships iirc
[23:23:40] <artao> yeah. prolly not
[23:23:44] <artao> depends on the purpose really
[23:24:03] <artao> because wood swells it can make a tighter seal than plastic
[23:24:17] <louipc> i guess part of the issue is when a bad piece of wood is selected
[23:24:19] <artao> but then it can also rot
[23:24:34] <artao> yeah. that too
[23:24:37] <louipc> when it gets moist then it swells, then it dries again then shrinks and it will crack
[23:24:56] <artao> hmm ... i wonder if different woods give a harmoica different tones
[23:25:05] <louipc> so i guess that could be a metric on quality wood selection
[23:25:18] <louipc> if it can withstand differing moisture
[23:25:33] <louipc> but i guess i just prefer not to test it lol
[23:25:48] <artao> yeah .. wood uses that depend on the wood absorbing water and swelling do generally need that wood to remain such
[23:25:55] <louipc> actually yea guitars cant get too dry either
[23:26:02] <louipc> or string instruments
[23:26:06] <artao> that does depend on the wood too tho
