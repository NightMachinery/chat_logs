[05:10:07] <DarthGandalf> simple: is your JSON.pm in some unusual place?
[05:15:40] <simple> nope, latest debian libjson-perl package
[05:15:55] <simple> installed it after znc loaded though, if that matters
[05:16:15] <simple> which it shouldn't
[05:17:18] <simple> are there any performance differences between the perl and python mods?  I'm fluent in both
[05:17:34] <simple> and the API is identical
[05:17:43] <simple> except some NV things with perl, for the most part
[05:18:21] <simple> i find that perl's eval and printing $@ works better than a try/except in python..
[05:19:27] <simple> it bothers me that loading a perl mod with bad code just says 'unable to find module' instead of an error message
[05:24:45] <DarthGandalf> znc -D may show the error message
[05:25:11] <simple> any way to enable that without a restart?
[05:25:29] <DarthGandalf> Maybe if you tried to load JSON.pm and somehow perl cached that it's not available?
[05:25:42] <DarthGandalf> check what's in %INC
[05:26:16] <simple> inc has /usr/share/perl5 where it is, so that's not it
[05:26:31] <DarthGandalf> there was some other variable which holds the loaded pm files
[05:26:33] <simple> that's the system %INC though.. does znc hold its own interpreter?
[05:26:35] <DarthGandalf> I thought it's INC
[05:27:34] <simple> perl -V shows @INC
[05:27:41] <DarthGandalf> I said %INC, not @INC
[05:28:07] <DarthGandalf> /znc loadmod perleval
[05:28:27] <DarthGandalf> /msg *perleval say %INC
[05:29:32] <simple> <*perleval> Error: Bareword "say" not allowed while "strict subs" in use at (eval 8) line 1.
[05:29:37] <DarthGandalf> hm, maybe "say" also outputs to stdout though
[05:29:46] <simple> i think it does
[05:30:06] <simple> <simp1e> print "test"
[05:30:06] <simple> <*perleval> Result: 1
[05:30:20] <simple> i guess i need to restart this sucker
[05:30:25] <DarthGandalf> use $self->PutModule then
[05:30:50] <DarthGandalf> or maybe with a foreach loop
[05:31:15] <simple> nah, i just restarted it with -D, i'm sure i wont regret it
[05:31:39] <DarthGandalf> I mean, if %INC does contain JSON and it's set to something like undef, I think removing it from %INC will let it load
[05:31:50] <DarthGandalf> but restarting also would fix it, yeah
[05:33:26] <simple> well, that worked..
[05:33:40] <simple> <multireplay> use JSON; $self->PutModule( encode_json {foo=>"bar"} )  ||  <*perleval> {"foo":"bar"}  || <*perleval> Result: 1
[05:34:15] <simple> aha, my error message now hits STDERR
[05:34:21] <simple> thanks for the -D
[05:34:58] <simple> doh, transposed a ) and a }
[05:35:01] <simple> no wonder it wouldn't load
[05:35:14] <simple> cheers =)
[05:35:36] <DarthGandalf> > are there any performance differences between the perl and python mods?
[05:35:38] <DarthGandalf> no idea
[05:35:41] <DarthGandalf> you can measure and report
[05:36:14] <simple> maybe i will =)
[05:36:20] <simple> dinnertime, thanks, and cya!

[06:46:12] <gry> I've made a copy of lastseen module, aiming to show whether users are blocked in an additional column, lastseen2.cpp (https://termbin.com/g652 ). But apparently SetNV() and the like are variables specific to each module. So while in blockuser module they mean a state of whether the user is blocked, in this module this information is not available, and instead this set of function pertains to whether or not the user was seen
[06:46:13] <gry> previously. What would you suggest? Edit modules/blockuser.cpp and add a Tmpl[USERNAME]["Blocked"] variable, and access it from within lastseen2? Or add a Tmpl['ListOfBlockedUsers'] in blockuser.cpp, and process that in lastseen2.cpp ? Or something else?

[20:36:13] <DarthGandalf> Yes, global module doesn't necessary have a user or network
[20:36:36] <DarthGandalf> in some contexts it does
[20:44:13] <simple> yep, after OnLoad, like OnModCommand sets it or something else does..

[21:06:12] <BSaboia> bookworm, Khaytsus: thanks for the info. I will see if I can find it. Apparently it is not saving, so I think I have to enable the logging module
[21:07:28] <BSaboia> `find ~/.znc -name '*.log' -type 'f' | wc -l` yields 0 for me
[21:09:06] <MetaNova> BSaboia: [[Log]] indicates where the logs are stored, depending on if you load *log globally (~/.znc/moddata/log) or for the user (~/.znc/users/<username>/moddata/log) or for a network (~/.znc/users/<username>/networks/<networkname>/moddata/log)
[21:09:07] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Log
[21:11:19] <BSaboia> MetaNova, yes, it was as easy as /znc LoadMod log
[21:11:32] <BSaboia> Now I think it will work. I only need to care about log rotation
