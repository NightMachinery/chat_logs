[10:09:32] <csh4dow[m]1> E-man[m]: exactly
[10:09:39] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> I need more contrast tbh

[10:10:56] <theo[m]> E-man[m]: how do you spawn windows?

[10:10:56] <theo[m]> or do you use python-autotiling or something?

[10:15:54] <M404[m]> hey  guys , how do you all use vpn in your linux systems ??
[10:16:02] <csh4dow[m]> openvpn
[10:16:29] <E-man[m]> I use Nord. But under the hood it runs openvpn
[10:16:34] <M404[m]> by downloading config files for specific country ?
[10:16:58] <csh4dow[m]1> yes
[10:17:25] <csh4dow[m]1> i have an ovpn file for 3 countries(US, UK and JAPAN)
[10:17:59] <M404[m]> ook , let me try
[10:18:14] <theo[m]> csh4dow[m]1: from where did you get it?
[10:18:23] <M404[m]> is it a good idea to use any of these free adware like browser based vpn ?
[10:18:28] <csh4dow[m]1> any vpn provider
[10:18:33] <csh4dow[m]1> i use mullvad
[10:18:38] <theo[m]> M404[m]: oh no
[10:18:38] <theo[m]> dont 
[10:18:38] <theo[m]> just dont
[10:18:51] <theo[m]> csh4dow[m]1: oh
[10:18:51] <theo[m]> no mehney
[10:18:51] <theo[m]> me broke as fuck
[10:19:27] <csh4dow[m]1> u can use protonvpn for free, but its slow as fuck
[10:19:54] <csh4dow[m]1> i have a 200Mbps connection and i used to get 5-6 Mbps on it
[10:20:00] <theo[m]> csh4dow[m]1: shyeet
[10:20:01] <theo[m]> my internet speed sucks already
[10:20:04] <theo[m]> csh4dow[m]1: demn
[10:20:13] <E-man[m]> M404[m]: No dont use free VPN if you want to watch videos. They are okay for text based access. But any free VPN will either be abysmally slow if they dont actually log and track or they will log and track
[10:20:38] <E-man[m]> * watch videos. Not just videos anything that needs lot of bandwidth They are
[10:20:47] <csh4dow[m]1> that is actually a good point
[10:21:00] <csh4dow[m]1> what is the purpose of ur vpn
[10:21:36] <E-man[m]> Mainly for blocked sites, netflix and sometimes for dropshipping sites
[10:22:09] <M404[m]> > <theo.> oh no
[10:22:09] <M404[m]> > dont 
[10:22:09] <M404[m]> > just dont
[10:22:09] <M404[m]> ok
[10:22:38] <E-man[m]> For text access tor is better. But then there is browser fingerprinting. Its very difficult to get away from fingerprinting
[10:23:08] <E-man[m]> The more security you use the more you'll stick out in the crowd.
[10:23:22] <NightFury[m]> Last time I tried to use open vpn it was not working properly so I did something to drivers and vpn started working, but wasn't able to download torrents I faced such issue
[10:23:34] <M404[m]> csh4dow[m]1: phub
[10:23:39] <M404[m]> mainly
[10:23:56] <csh4dow[m]1> use tor
[10:24:07] <M404[m]> tor is slow
[10:24:30] <E-man[m]> M404[m]: Bruh use Reddit. You dont even have to hide. You'll be lost with there being so many accounts doing the same shit.
[10:24:50] <E-man[m]> There are a lot of nsfw stuff on Reddit and twitter even
[10:24:54] <csh4dow[m]1> its the best "free" alternative for ur purpose
[10:25:16] <E-man[m]> "Degeneracy knows no bounds" - twitter
[10:25:29] <NightFury[m]> Just a small question some websites which provide torrents tell us to use vpn is it that compulsory?
[10:25:37] <csh4dow[m]1> no
[10:25:47] <csh4dow[m]1> just privacy for piracy
[10:26:05] <M404[m]> E-man[m]: ok i'll try
[10:26:22] <E-man[m]> NightFury[m]: Not really. They want to sell you some shady VPN. People generally overestimate their threat model.
[10:26:52] <NightFury[m]> E-man[m]: Ok fine.
[10:27:59] <E-man[m]> Just dont click links that leads you out of Reddit to phub or other sites. If you are UP and the police are feeling bored they might come have a talk. It also depends on your ISP
[10:28:16] <E-man[m]> * you are in UP and
[10:28:26] <csh4dow[m]1> doesnt work like that
[10:28:34] <csh4dow[m]1> indian cybercrime division is shit
[10:28:49] <E-man[m]> But people did get arrested in UP for porn
[10:28:56] <AryaBackup[m]> just dont see p***
[10:28:58] <E-man[m]> But Ofcourse media never gives the full stiry
[10:29:24] <csh4dow[m]1> AryaBackup[m]: ofc, thats the obvious solution
[10:29:53] <E-man[m]> s/stiry/story/
[10:31:05] <NightFury[m]> * which provide movie torrents tell
[10:32:11] <testuser[m]> Don't watch
[10:32:13] <testuser[m]> Rots ur brain
[10:32:15] <testuser[m]> Haram
[10:32:32] <E-man[m]> AryaBackup[m]: Honestly good advice. Porn addiction is a real thing and gives very unrealistic expectations from normal relationships and sex.
[10:33:06] <testuser[m]> Install gentoo or something instead
[10:34:42] <AryaBackup[m]> XD
[10:34:59] <AryaBackup[m]> chad move
[10:36:00] <E-man[m]> testuser[m]: Not the only reason why people should stop watching. But if it helps you not watch then great. Porn is bad in general over time, like any other drugs.
[10:36:34] <E-man[m]> testuser[m]: Yeah he wont have time for anything else for a few days if he's new.
[10:39:30] <theo[m]> <E-man[m]> "Just dont click links that leads..." <- well, is watching p0rn that problematic?
[10:39:50] <theo[m]> <testuser[m]> "Rots ur brain" <- oh yeah
[10:40:20] <E-man[m]> theo[m]: Problematic in the getting arrested kind or effs you up kind?
[10:40:23] <theo[m]> E-man[m]: you sound like someone wise
[10:40:32] <theo[m]> E-man[m]: getting arrested
[10:40:49] <E-man[m]> theo[m]: I am just old XD
[10:42:05] <E-man[m]> theo[m]: Depends on the state and how zealous the govt is feeling. Its generally done for show. Some poor chaps gets arrested and have their faces plasters in media to show work is being done. Normally if in most States I haven't heard anyone being arrested for thos
[10:43:14] <theo[m]> E-man[m]: same, i havent heard anything like that
[10:43:23] <E-man[m]> I heard about UP tho
[10:43:25] <E-man[m]> Just google
[10:43:38] <E-man[m]> Last years news
[10:44:05] <theo[m]> E-man[m]: well, no offence
[10:44:05] <theo[m]> but north india is weird
[10:45:17] <E-man[m]> Dunno about the whole of north India but UP definitely feels a bit like the Florida of India.
[10:45:40] <theo[m]> E-man[m]: lmaoooooo
[10:45:40] <theo[m]> i like that
[10:46:39] <E-man[m]> Its just that the population of UP is huge man. Like bigger than some whole EU countries. There's statistically bound to be more wierd people when there are so many people

[11:02:37] <E-man[m]> iamak[m]: Yep. And kernel packages are a bit different from normal userland packages.
[11:02:42] <E-man[m]> iamak[m]: Not officially
[11:02:55] <E-man[m]> But there is active development ongoing
[11:03:03] <E-man[m]> Plus this is not for arch
[11:03:15] <E-man[m]> Kernel comes from upstream linux kernel
[11:03:28] <iamak[m]> Oh okay
[11:03:53] <iamak[m]> What about zen? Can I use that safely? or do I have to worry about stuff breaking when I use it?
[11:04:13] <E-man[m]> You mean amd ryzen?
[11:04:15] <E-man[m]> Or the kernel
[11:04:30] <iamak[m]> Kernel
[11:04:33] <iamak[m]> `linux-zen`
[11:05:29] <E-man[m]> As the post said that arch supported the compression from lot before. I should not see how it would be breaking. Maintainers generally tries to make breaking changes as less ad possible
[11:05:47] <E-man[m]> s/should/dont/, s/not//
[11:06:04] <iamak[m]> Okay
[11:06:46] <E-man[m]> There is always a chance of *something* breaking when updating on bleeding edge. So maybe try it out on a VM if you have important data and no backup (a bad move)
[11:10:15] <iamak[m]> I don't have any important data on this PC so I am not worried about that
[11:10:28] <iamak[m]> I am worried about having to fix the broken stuff xD

[15:49:25] <E-man[m]> > Cause this rarely happens to me
[15:49:25] <E-man[m]> I generally always use memory allocation in pairs. Whenever I use malloc or something similar I immediately write a statement to free it next. I just place it where needed.
[15:49:25] <E-man[m]> As for assigments I generally assign one variable per line unless they have similar meaning.
[15:50:02] <telegram_1282615> Ok sir
[15:50:02] <telegram_1282615> Thanks :)
[15:51:09] <E-man[m]> I still miss sometimes tho. It comes with the language. But yeah I am sure there are sanitizers for C that checks these, I just havent used any personally.

[16:39:28] <vipul[m]> I don't find it annoying at all. I use it in daemon and client mode. Have set it up just once a long time ago. Everything works. And in terms of resource footprint Nothing beats it.
[16:45:36] <AryaBackup[m]> is there something like urxvt for wayland
[16:45:59] <AryaBackup[m]> i think foot has server-client but not sure

[16:55:14] <vipul[m]> <AryaBackup[m]> "i think foot has server-client..." <- Yes foot is even lighter than urxvt and yes it has server client as well
[16:55:41] <AryaBackup[m]> vipul[m]: really?
[16:55:50] <vipul[m]> AryaBackup[m]: Yup
[16:56:40] <vipul[m]> <smud[m]1> "If you don't count framebuffer..." <- What's that
[16:58:28] <smud[m]1> Hehe press ctrl+alt+f3
[17:08:59] <hemish> I use sakura, that just uses vte without any external dependencies, a gtk3 terminal which natively works under Wayland without any gnome dependencies or any dependencies except vte, also it is configurable via a right click gui, which saves configuration in text file in .config/sakura which is human readable and can be configured through that text file itself

[18:42:53] <theo[m]> vipul[m]: i told you earlier
[18:42:53] <theo[m]> but anyways
[18:42:53] <theo[m]> peace.
[18:43:45] <vipul[m]> > <theo.> i told you earlier
[18:43:45] <vipul[m]> > but anyways
[18:43:45] <vipul[m]> > peace.
[18:43:45] <vipul[m]> no i was serious i might talk with the urxvt devs to give some suggestions if possible
[18:45:03] <vipul[m]> i use it. because i have not found any other terminal that uses ram lesser than what it uses. while being as usable as possible
[20:20:38] <theo[m]> <vipul[m]> "> <theo.> i told you earlier..." <- oh,
[20:20:38] <theo[m]> my only problem is built-in resizing lol
[20:20:53] <theo[m]> <vipul[m]> "i use it. because i have not..." <- i doubt that
[20:20:53] <theo[m]> st is much much lower in my experience
[20:21:32] <theo[m]> i use siduck's fork of st
[20:21:32] <theo[m]> its been very lean on ram
[20:21:32] <theo[m]> went beyond urxvt
[20:21:32] <theo[m]> urxvt landed on #2 in my tests
[20:21:48] <vipul[m]> > <theo.> i doubt that
[20:21:48] <vipul[m]> > st is much much lower in my experience
[20:21:48] <vipul[m]> If i open 100 windows of urxvt it uses under 300 megs of ram
[20:21:53] <theo[m]> <vipul[m]> "> <theo.> i told you earlier..." <- and so sorry for the delay,
[20:21:53] <theo[m]> i had some work to do hehe
[20:22:13] <vipul[m]> vipul[m]: Server client mode btw
[20:22:19] <theo[m]> vipul[m]: why would anyone open 100 windows lol
[20:22:19] <theo[m]> gotta be realistic
[20:22:41] <theo[m]> vipul[m]: well, same can be accomplished with tmux, can't it be?
[20:23:04] <vipul[m]> > <theo.> why would anyone open 100 windows lol
[20:23:04] <vipul[m]> > gotta be realistic
[20:23:04] <vipul[m]> Yeah even if you don't open much they are same the difference happen when a count exceeds 10
[20:23:40] <vipul[m]> theo[m]: Tmux needs an emulator. I'm talking about opening seperate instances of a program
[20:24:17] <theo[m]> vipul[m]: maybe i havent understood the whole server-client model lol
[20:24:28] <theo[m]> vipul[m]: oh
[20:24:28] <theo[m]> i get it
[20:28:17] <vipul[m]> theo[m]: It's similar to Emacs daemon or server
[20:29:53] <theo[m]> vipul[m]: i dont use emacs too lol
[20:29:53] <theo[m]> i tried emacs twice, but for some reason, i dont feel like delving into it
[20:30:00] <theo[m]> seems weird for some reason
[20:30:08] <theo[m]> i dunno how to say this
[20:32:04] <vipul[m]> > <theo.> i dont use emacs too lol
[20:32:04] <vipul[m]> > i tried emacs twice, but for some reason, i dont feel like delving into it
[20:32:04] <vipul[m]> Well it's just that a service named urxvtd is autostarted and running always and whenever you want to actually run that package you call for it as branches of that daemon. Pretty simple. Reading man page is enough. Always 🙂
[20:33:38] <theo[m]> vipul[m]: cool
[20:33:38] <theo[m]> but i dunno about its practical applications
[20:33:38] <theo[m]> thanks for the explanation btw
[20:33:38] <theo[m]> i really appreciate it
[20:34:11] <vipul[m]> > <theo.> cool... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/789dc5a973eadc683fc9191e5756702600f9fa1a)
[20:34:20] <vipul[m]> * The memory footprint drastically reduces without any other downside
[20:40:17] <Hemishhehim[m]> well gnome-terminal also implements server client model
[20:41:31] <Hemishhehim[m]> btw what the heck is spamhaus-xbl? i cant access my znc now randomly, it was working fine till last time i used it this afternoon and now that irc bouncer says that my ip is in spamhaus-xbl
