[00:48:06] <andrewrk> tgschultz, I know you've been (rightly) annoyed at the quantity of bugs lately, I hope you'll give me a bit more time to get there. as zig is a small team with a tight budget, I'm making some priority tradeoffs in order to get to 1.0 faster (but to be clear 1.0 means a robust project with very few bugs)
[00:48:35] <andrewrk> it really is like an econ building game, where you juggle different resources, only some of which are money

[01:28:20] <tgschultz> andrewrk: nah, it's all good. I just get frustrated some times.
[01:30:44] <andrewrk> I think part of the frustration comes with the dissonance between the upbeat, enthusiastic attitude that the project presents to the outside world, mixed with the reality of dealing with bugs in pre-1.0 software. ultimately it comes down to the fact that we have to attract both collaborators and donors in order to effectively complete the project faster and more robustly, and that's just part of making progress on the project
[01:31:19] <andrewrk> my goal is never to deceive anyone, but I'd be a fool to not try to show off what *does* work well in order to attract investment from the outside world in helping the project to completion

[01:37:26] <tgschultz> most of zig works really well too. the bit packed struct thing just bothered me a lot because I couldn't even work around the strange behavior with it, and I happen to be doing a lot of bit packing stuff in projects lately.
[01:37:37] <tgschultz> somewhat related: I can make a case that packed structs should not have their in-memory <1byte-aligned field order dependent on endianess. In my current project I have several structs that I have to layout twice. I've considered writing an Endianize fn that does the re-layout for me.
[01:41:35] <andrewrk> tgschultz, would you be interested in doing a 1:1 chat with me at some point and share your screen and stuff? it would be helpful for me right before I go in and implement this feature in self-hosted (which is going to be soon)
[01:41:51] <andrewrk> I think you're the one with the most interesting use cases for packed structs
[01:45:17] <tgschultz> sure, my email is on my github profile so you can use that to arrange something. I'll dig up and update some old code that's related too.

[03:33:45] <andrewrk> oof
[03:40:58] <tgschultz> bad documentation is often worse than no documentation
[03:42:27] <marler8997> I think the biggest problem is that the guy who created the GNU linker liked to be clever.  Rather than requiring the script to specify everything and be explicit, he probably thought it was cute to try and figure out what the user wanted, and then never documented all the cute things he did to *make people's lives easier*
[03:43:56] <marler8997> Because you know, we're all writing linker scripts all the time and it's going to save developer's so much time when they don't need to type so much into their linker scripts

[15:23:37] <daurnimator> cursey: not really? essentially enumerate the return codes of a C api and expand them into zig errors. `switch(res) { .ERR_BLAH => return error.Blah, .ERR_FLOOB => return error.Floob, ....... }`
[15:24:54] <cursey> i basically created a function to do that so now i just `try handleErr(c.some_c_api(...))` and was wondering if that would look out of place since i'm new to zig
[15:26:02] <cursey> since every function returns the same error enum in the c api

[16:26:09] <flux_control> cursey: Considering that different functions can also effectively return the same error as different values (a file access error as a #define'd EACCESS or as some negative number when returning a pointer otherwise, for example), it's not possible to do it in a straightforward manner.
[16:26:57] *** Quits: Vexu (~Thunderbi@188.117.20.105) (Quit: Vexu)
[16:27:26] <flux_control> And that's if they even define what the actual error is. Some APIs may abuse a single error code to cover whole ranges of errors.
[16:28:31] <flux_control> Also, some C APIs don't actually return an error code at all, but (ab)use the global error variable that you then have to check (and clear) separately.
