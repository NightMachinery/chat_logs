[02:02:20] <stemid> yes so how does that work with multiple quotations? that doesn't matter because they're inside the $()=?
[02:02:40] <earnestly> stemid: You need to quote both
[02:02:43] <earnestly> Hmm
[02:02:59] <earnestly> This question might mean you're overthinking things, perhaps applying programming language logic to this
[02:03:59] <earnestly> stemid: If you don't quote an expansion, of any kind, it will undergo wordsplitting if expanded in a context where wordsplitting takes place.  (think split(string, [\t\n ]) like in some programming language)
[02:04:23] <earnestly> stemid: Both () and $() introduce a subshell, and within that subshell the same rules apply
[02:04:52] <earnestly> "$(so "$this" also has to be quoted)"
[02:05:34] <earnestly> stemid: $() work like any $variable, with the only difference between that the string it expands it so produced from a command's stdout
[02:05:53] <stemid> yeah I get that but I guess the explanation I was looking for was that $() executes as its own subshell with its own quotes. regardless of surrounding quotes.
[02:05:55] <earnestly> expands to is produced*
[02:06:17] <earnestly> stemid: What do you mean by "with its own quotes"?
[02:06:38] <stemid> it doesn't matter what quotes are around $() because it only processes the quotes inside the subshell.
[02:06:46] <stemid> just putting my own words on it but I think we're saying the same thing.

[16:55:59] <Soliton> set email_subject once you know the backup status.
[16:56:10] <tirnanog> why can you not compose the email_subject at the point that you the status is known and you are about to send the email?
[16:56:13] <Soliton> or don't use that variable at all it seems fairly useless.
[16:56:37] <Soliton> are there many places where you use email_subject?

[16:58:08] <tirnanog> right. so why can you not defer the composition of the subject line until _after_ having made that inference?
[16:58:09] <Gege> i know what you mean now lol
[16:58:26] <Gege> okok, i reason i did it before is because i group all the definition together at one part of code

[17:55:48] <tirnanog> for f in mycmd doesn't make sense to begin with. perhaps you want a read loop instead?
[17:57:45] <twkm> mycmd won't be run merely because it is mentioned.
[17:58:25] <ash_worksi> mycmd actually outputs a space separated list

[18:04:21] <greybot> Never do this: for x in $(command) or `command` or $var. for-in is used for iterating arguments, not (output) strings. Instead, use a glob (eg. *.txt), arrays (eg.

[21:39:21] <twkm> you can't load the buffer with arbitrary data, you must kill something into it.
[21:40:14] <twkm> read can load arbitrary data into the buffer that will be returned to it by readline, if that's useful.
[21:44:01] <sybariten> i have no clue, but i think you may be thinking of something else there

[22:51:43] <phy1729> or the bot is dead
[22:51:49] <koala_man> huh
[22:52:05] <n4dir> phy1729: i did check it twice, shellcheck itself didn't complain. It is more about the "general logic"
[22:52:19] <phy1729> No need to %s a static string in printf
[22:52:25] <n4dir> thanks
[22:52:57] <n4dir> wondered about it myself.

[22:53:22] <phy1729> I'd inline the environment var since it's only needed by jackd (presumably)
[22:53:43] <n4dir> sorry, what is "inline" ?
[22:53:48] <phy1729> for the right way to check if things are running, that's an os question
[22:53:55] <phy1729> FOO=1 some_command
[22:54:16] <n4dir> ah, rather OS question. Sorry then. Still thanks for the corrections and explanations
[22:54:46] <n4dir> if not .profile it wouldn't bother me much. I found no better (and quick) way. Anyway: thanks

[23:03:11] <koala_man> looks like Libera has started requiring SASL which the bots currently don't use. I'll have to fix them later today
[23:03:59] <phy1729> Ah if you're on a VPS those ranges tend to get SASL'd
[23:04:27] <phy1729> You could probably ask a staffer for an exception, but SASL plain is fairly simple
[23:04:38] <koala_man> yeah it's just because the bots are ancient
