[00:06:34] <biys> i think the early Muslim conquests starting around the 7th century then the crusades that happened as a result definitely spread the abrahamic religions and doctrine far and wide
[00:07:00] <biys> that isn't to say that the ideas originated with the Muslims or the Jews or the Christians
[00:07:12] <biys> they're simply the latest iteration of
[00:07:22] <biys> and calling me a conservative means absolutely nothing to me
[00:07:28] <biys> i don't identify as a conservative
[00:07:34] <biys> *shrug*
[00:08:04] <biys> but to say that your understanding of the world is void of the pretexts associated with the abrahamic religions...
[00:08:08] <biys> it kind of a laugh to me
[00:09:06] <audrey> biys: to get a sense of how underdefined «conservative» is, consider that the Russian Communist Party would likely agree with the US Republican Party on a variety of social issues ranging from immigration to protectionism to abortion.
[00:10:07] <audrey> But is the CPRF conservative?? Not by any commonsense measure.
[00:11:47] <I_Am_M00t> another red herring, that was never the claim
[00:11:48] <audrey> I never thought I´d say this, but domestic Russian politics is more comprehensible to me now than US politics.

[00:55:27] <biys> audrey: i think that for the normal brain it's easier to categorize things if they're done simply
[00:55:41] <biys> i read this book a couple weeks back about poor bashing
[00:56:04] <biys> and the book was such a drastic oversimplification that i found it was essentially nonsense
[00:56:11] <biys> i understand what the author is driving at
[00:56:15] <biys> and i think they have valid points
[00:56:34] <biys> but the way they do it lacks clarity to the point that it becomes nonsense
[00:57:13] <biys> i've said it before and i'll say it again
[00:57:31] <biys> it must be extremely freeing and liberating be able to look at ones own thoughts and think they are the most accurate thoughts
[00:57:35] <biys> i really envy people like that
[00:57:53] <biys> i kind of think of everything as a never ending onion, myself
[00:58:00] <biys> when i start to peal back the layers i almost regret it
[00:58:07] <biys> cause it's like "wtf did i get myself into?!?"
[00:58:16] <biys> but it's something i've started and i can't just stop
[00:58:35] <biys> i call it "opening a can of worms"
[00:58:43] <zicada> wow, thats a lot of text
[00:59:37] <biys> reminds me of the first house i bought.  my wife and i were completely on board with doing renos
[00:59:51] <biys> but it almost seemed like every project we started opened a never ending can of worms
[01:00:00] <biys> so we just said screw it and bought a new house
[01:00:36] <biys> to your previous claims though zicada
[01:01:01] <biys> i wouldn't say that it's neo-geocentrism
[01:01:20] <biys> it's more like...  historically relevant
[01:01:36] <biys> i'm not saying that "christianity is the center"
[01:01:44] <biys> i'm saying that christianity played a very significant role
[01:01:56] <biys> to say that it didn't is...  wrong
[01:02:54] <biys> it's kind of like saying that the cheating that took place in F1 racing didn't progress the sport to what it is today
[01:03:14] <biys> the fact of the matter is, a lot of the technological advacements associated with F1 racing were as a result of cheating
[01:03:34] <biys> if it wasn't for people cheating the technological advancements that happened in F1 racing wouldn't have progressed the sport to what it is today
[01:03:55] <biys> so to say that "cheating played no role in F1 racing"
[01:04:00] <biys> that's essentially n onsense
[01:04:01] <zicada> my brain just cant process all this. Its masturbation
[01:04:02] <zicada> :>
[01:04:07] <biys> fair enough
[01:04:34] <biys> it's likely because you're looking to remove the underpinning from the ideas in order to maintain your desired outlook

[01:07:47] <I_Am_M00t> that's philosophy
[01:08:10] <causative_> the basic premise of philosophy is that we ought to seek knowledge, and only accept justified claims, and reject contradictions; to engage in philosophy is to accept these notions
[01:08:25] <causative_> with respect to the is-ought divide, that's already an "ought"
[01:08:29] <I_Am_M00t> maybe in theory, but that sure ain't what i'm observing
[01:09:01] <biys> I_Am_M00t: that is becauase you're acting like Michael Moore.  starting with an idea and working backwards from there
[01:09:08] <biys> attempting to sunstantiate your claim the entire way through
[01:09:12] <biys> which is fine!
[01:09:16] <biys> it just isn't how it works for me
[01:09:18] <I_Am_M00t> a lot of the rising "philosophers" seem to have mastered the art of word salads
[01:09:43] <causative_> imagine we had a purely rational reason to behave morally, the way Kant thought he had discovered, but correct, unlike Kant. Even if we had this purely rational reason, it would be powerless over people unless they first accepted that they ought to behave rationally.

[01:09:53] <I_Am_M00t> and by a lot, i mean the handful of intellectuals that get all the attention on youtube
[01:10:09] <causative_> so we see the "ought of reason" is a prerequisite to all other oughts that we might try to justify in philosophy
[01:10:32] <I_Am_M00t> biys: i cannot imagine that you've said anything other than "nothing matters, therefore I am right"
[01:10:47] <biys> i never said nothing matters

[01:14:07] <biys> i admit, i could be wrong though
[01:14:11] <causative_> elenchus is the only way to disagree in depth without getting mad
[01:14:33] <causative_> set as the goal, a mutual understanding
[01:14:42] <causative_> and to understand one's own views better by explaining them and having them be interrogated
[01:15:17] <causative_> to win is not to prove yourself right and the other wrong; to win is to have helped reach greater understanding for yourself *or* the other person
[01:15:20] <I_Am_M00t> If you think my argument is invalid biys, then that's because it is invalid. But more importantly, that's exactly what your argument boils down to: a rejection of empiricism and knowledge, followed by a claim to knowledge.
[01:16:03] <causative_> elenchus is *cooperative* debate between those who disagree; because while two people may disagree, they can both be truth-seekers and hence allies
[01:16:31] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i never said your perspective is invalid
[01:16:41] <biys> i don't think you've outlined a perspective short of mind being wrong
[01:16:46] <biys> s/mind/mine/

[01:16:48] <I_Am_M00t> I'm misrepresenting you a little bit biys, you attempt to humanize your argument by inserting short anecdotes, and references to your family life.
[01:16:56] <biys> i have really no clue what your position is other than you disagree with mine
[01:17:00] <biys> much like you disagree with causative_

[01:19:02] <biys> you are truly a bastion of reason and understanding
[01:20:25] <biys> also, i'm not sure how you can make the claim you have given i've said that i don't even trust my own thoughts
[01:20:42] <causative_> we need a philosophy discussion platform where two people can diagram their arguments and justifications, and their understanding of the other person's arguments and justifications, and attach questions visually to different assertions of the other person
[01:20:46] <biys> and i've often put "thoughts" in quotes
[01:20:53] <biys> because i tend to not even think my own thoughts are my own
[01:21:03] <biys> they are a result of my intersectionality and the indocrination i've experienced
[01:21:20] <causative_> and place statements that are void of substantive content, such as pissing matches, straight in the garbage, visually
[01:21:20] <biys> but tell me more about solipsism
[01:21:34] <causative_> a visual elenchus discussion platform
[01:21:43] <biys> causative_: i'm a big fan of steelmanning personally
[01:22:02] <biys> because it lets you know that i understand what you're saying
[01:22:13] <biys> because i can reiterate what you've said in my own words
[01:22:17] <causative_> yeah steelmanning is good
[01:22:18] <biys> and ask you if it's accurate or not
[01:22:26] <causative_> yes, asking if it's accurate is elenchus
[01:22:34] <causative_> trying to find out what the other person really believes
[01:22:56] <biys> i would say that I_Am_M00t typically engages in simply attempting to provoke instead of understand
[01:23:20] <biys> i know i'm guilty of it at times
[01:23:30] <biys> i try not to, but sometimes i lose control

[01:23:56] <biys> i'll bbiab again
[01:24:30] <I_Am_M00t> haha, biys never holds discussion in good faith, that's the issue
[01:24:41] <I_Am_M00t> and what was one of the assumptions in elenchus causative_ ?
[01:25:07] <causative_> well, that the two participants are both interested in seeking after truth rather than asserting social dominance
[01:25:16] <I_Am_M00t> there you go
[01:25:44] <I_Am_M00t> so then, you must have a moderator of sorts?
[01:26:28] <causative_> well, you could just decide not to talk to someone who refuses to engage in elenchus
[01:26:37] <causative_> you don't need a third party
[01:27:43] <causative_> *if* the moderator is fully committed to the principles of elenchus, and can be trusted to be impartial to any particular viewpoint, then they could be beneficial, but that's a big ask
[01:28:13] <I_Am_M00t> haha
[01:28:22] <I_Am_M00t> yeah, i think reality is a bit more complex than that

[02:14:49] <causative_> the main problem with ignore on IRC is that you miss out on half of conversations. I think the way to solve this is to have a discrete concept of "conversations" where you can only participate in a conversation if you aren't ignored by anyone already in it
[02:15:10] <causative_> so each room could have multiple conversations going on at once

[18:03:49] <biys> ikr
[18:04:23] <Lumine> Hello audrey
[18:04:25] <biys> i think my favorite line of that poem is uh
[18:04:27] <audrey> Hey Lumine
[18:04:33] <biys> "where the jolliest people are candidly stark"
[18:04:55] <biys> they accept with a toast that escape is a folly
[18:05:11] <Lumine> I think I had a cramp on my leg while sleeping
[18:06:07] <Lumine> Either that or I've been running a lot in my sleep
[18:07:58] <audrey> biys: I showed the poem to a friend of mine and he commented that it sounded a lot like life on an Indian reservation
[18:08:26] <audrey> I am not sure if Boris Ryzhy had in mind a gulag, or just one of those ghastly northern towns that only exists due to slave labor
[18:08:26] <biys> now that you mention it i could see that given what i've heard of canadian aboriginal reserves
[18:08:37] <Lumine> I've written a few poems, some of them got decent feedback
[18:08:55] <Lumine> But I haven't done it since last summer
[18:09:46] <biys> i did think the last line kind of mentioning the inability to escape the landscape
[18:10:46] <biys> thing with me and poems is... i'm used to reading literature where there's a full page that is a single paragraph describing the landscape and the tone
[18:11:01] <biys> poems tend to be too brief for me
[18:11:06] <audrey> the talk about the drunk friend and the convicts suggests to me he's describing a place like Murmansk or something
[18:11:39] <audrey> not a gulag per se, but you are kind of stuck due to various socioeconomic factors
[18:11:49] <biys> like go from reading doestoevsky where he'll ramble for a good 5-10 minutes on just what a dude sees when he's walking down a street
[18:11:50] <audrey> keep in mind this was written at the nadir of the Russian collapse in the 1990s
[18:11:57] <biys> to the entire poem being 10 or 15 lines
[18:12:16] <audrey> well, the essence of good poetry is pithiness
[18:12:26] <biys> yah
[18:13:00] <audrey> A hallmark of a good poem is one that can say more with less, that can evoke concrete feelings and images in your "mind's eye" without having to make it explicit.
[18:13:25] <arryana> ta, audrey
[18:13:41] <biys> i probably need to read more poetry
[18:13:57] <audrey> I am experimenting with a novella right now that is told in present tense, with most of the "chapters" very short scenes of 100-300 words.
[18:14:04] <biys> like.. i don't think i ever would have come up with what you said myself
[18:14:08] <biys> maybe i lack imagination
[18:14:16] <biys> or maybe it's just so far outside my wheelhouse
[18:14:21] <biys> that it seems foreign

[18:16:02] <mannequin> poetry? i write poetry.
[18:16:22] <mannequin> fraszki (frasks)
[18:16:24] <audrey> I had the good fortune to take a colloquium with a very well-known American poet, back in my college days.
[18:17:01] <audrey> We couldn't translate poems; we had to come up with our own. And most of them were dogs, and we all knew it. It's frustrating to have the taste to discern good poetry from bad, and yet not be able to write good poetry yourself
[18:17:13] <biys> hah
[18:17:15] <biys> that's funny
[18:17:33] <audrey> At the very end of the semester I came up with one poem which the professor liked.
[18:17:34] <biys> not mockingly either
[18:17:39] <biys> more funny matter of factly
[18:17:57] *** Quits: Keter (~Keter@user/keter) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:18:07] <audrey> That might have been the high point of college for me. He was quite harsh and had a skill at trashing what we'd written, in a tough-love way.

[18:18:28] <ro-bot-o> [url] Maybe | vlepy.github.io
[18:18:36] <audrey> So it was nice when the professor read it aloud in class, said "yes, that's nice," lingered for a minute and moved on.
[18:18:57] <mannequin> it's a short poem (a frask)

[18:26:59] <audrey> biys: He had some great put-downs, too. We were not allowed to speak when our poems were being read - to force us to say all we want to say through the text.
[18:27:11] <audrey> biys: But boy would he get unhappy if someone was sloppy
[18:27:26] <biys> i'd probably get offended
[18:27:29] <audrey> He'd finish a poem and say, "This was such garbage I can't dignify it with a modifier"
[18:27:40] <biys> but attempt to maintain composure
[18:27:48] <biys> then not show up to the following classes
[18:27:48] <biys> HAH
[18:28:03] <audrey> Oh, the college kids were all pissed by this, but their hands were forced
[18:28:14] <audrey> because they were selected from a pool of hundreds of students who wanted to take this course
[18:28:29] <audrey> and they couldn't walk out now
[18:28:29] <biys> haha that makes it worse!
[18:28:42] <biys> storm out
[18:28:45] <biys> storm back in shortly after
[18:28:59] <biys> reminds me of that movie with that drummer and john malcovich
[18:29:00] <audrey> I don't think the prof would make it a semester today, he'd just get himself and his 1970s corduroy jacket cancelled.

[18:37:09] <arryana> it's a good thing you got past that
[18:37:10] <audrey> The male students seemed to laugh it off more easily
[18:37:17] <arryana> did the male students take it any better?
[18:37:18] <audrey> I mean, it didn't discourage me from writing
[18:37:26] <audrey> I think some of the male students thought he was a classic
[18:37:44] <audrey> We were six girls and six guys (twelve total, out of I don't know how many hundreds of applicants in my alma mater)
[18:38:11] <audrey> But none of us dropped the course. And what's more, our poetry was getting better by the end of the semester and we could all tell it was getting better.
[18:38:37] <audrey> It was magical, in a kind of perverted way. I never had another college class quite like it.
[18:38:52] <arryana> i have to say, from my own experience, i found that having brothers was -awesome- in that sense.  there was no special dispensation for 'feelings'
[18:40:02] <audrey> (I spent most of my free time after hours in the recital hall teaching myself to play Liszt and Chopin, so I was already a misfit compared to the average computer scientist yuppie who gets churned out by my alma mater.)

[18:40:33] <arryana> and i say that as a compliment

[18:47:52] <audrey> It's easy to get complacent when you're writing and think, "yeah I love this" and never get a reality check.
[18:48:05] <biys> did it make you spend more time writing?  did you trash more work as a result?
[18:48:21] <audrey> It did make me a lot more strict about my standards, and the quality of writing I was aiming for
[18:48:34] <pussipupu> Guess I'm lucky I hate my writing
[18:48:35] <audrey> I must have gone through 10 drafts of the first five chapters of my first novel and trashed them all
[18:48:44] <biys> i remember you saying that
[18:48:46] <audrey> and when I go back to read them I agree that they are trash
[18:48:48] <arryana> hate it, why?
[18:49:10] <audrey> and in comparison the most recent draft still seems bad, but a helluva lot better than the first draft
[18:49:32] <audrey> I lost interest in that particular storyline, though the plot is pretty much written in my head and I'd like to return to finish it at some point.

[21:14:27] <pussipupu> I don't really know how cold it gets down south there
[21:16:25] <blkshp> Don't be silly, the scottish can't make cars!
[21:16:33] <blkshp> They'd all drink too much :D

[21:17:09] <blkshp> oops
[21:17:12] <pussipupu> I also can't make cars, but I still have to plug my car in in the winter
[21:17:26] <arryana> the only place i've ever seen engine block heaters as a regular thing was in minnesota
[21:17:31] <blkshp> well you live in a frozen wonder!
[21:17:46] <arryana> haha
[21:17:50] <arryana> it's 36 here now

[21:19:05] <arryana> i may be in scotland, but i still think in f.
[21:19:30] <blkshp> You should electrocute yourself when you think 'f' xD
[21:19:54] <pussipupu> So like, um 10/9°F
[21:20:06] <blkshp> just a bit, not skin meltingly but ... did you ever play with "shocking tanks" :D
[21:20:06] <arryana> haha
[21:20:12] <pussipupu> If I've remembered how the conversion works :p
[21:20:17] <arryana> considering i have dyscalculia, it's a wonder i can even do f.
[21:20:23] <arryana> c is out of my range
[21:20:40] <pussipupu> no that must be wrong, must be like three or four F
[21:20:58] <arryana> it's not much above freezing
[21:21:00] <arryana> if that helps

[21:24:40] <arryana> my longest-held friend asked me how warm it gets here in the summer
[21:24:50] <arryana> i think we had two days over 80f last year
[21:26:43] <pussipupu> too hot
[21:26:48] <pussipupu> unless you're by the lake
[21:27:05] <arryana> well, i think it was 80 and 81.  and that lasted for like, an hour.
[21:28:56] <pussipupu> We had about that and higher for what felt like a thousand fucking years this summer

[21:31:49] <arryana> good idea
[21:31:58] <pussipupu> And bitterly resented having to come above ground for work
[21:32:10] <arryana> i'd like to install an attic fan for next year
[21:32:27] <darklambda> i like sleeping in those bed with hole for the head

[21:41:27] <arryana> i've never had a professional massage, but i've considered going to a chiropractic office

[21:42:24] <pussipupu> Actual chiropractic is dangerous pseudo medicine
[21:42:41] <arryana> that's the other reason

[21:43:07] <arryana> i lived in a physical rehab hospital for a while in my teens, and there were -no- chiropractic people on staff
[21:43:30] <arryana> i'm good about doing standard physio, even now

[21:44:22] <arryana> i'd like to wait as long as possible, though
[21:45:43] <arryana> when i was 21 they wanted to amputate my lower leg, as 'a prosthetic is less damaging than an orthotic', but i didn't go for the amputation
[21:45:47] <pussipupu> Hopefully you can get a printed one, they're coming along nicely
[21:46:25] <arryana> that's one of the reasons i've been waiting, tech is improving
[21:46:47] <arryana> it's just years of wear and tear from wearing a brace when i was younger.
[21:47:38] <arryana> i think a lot of that has been balanced by the excellent work of some of the physio people, even now i don't limp.
[21:47:43] <arryana> despite my age and the amount of damage
[21:48:06] <arryana> i admit, i'd love a disc standing swing, if i could figure out where to put it.
[21:48:27] <arryana> that thing is a pain in my metaphorical balls, but i miss it.
[21:48:56] <arryana> the idea being, it's a wooden circle on three ropes, which attach to the ceiling
[21:49:20] <arryana> and you learn to keep your balance on it as it's swung.  then you learn to use your own weight to swing it to various positions.
[21:50:49] <pussipupu> There's a balance platform for dog physiotherapy at work that I want at home, it's electrically driven though so not the same exercise
