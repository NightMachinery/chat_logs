[00:08:34] <Nanobot> I'd like to quit smoking.
[00:09:08] <Nanobot> Unfortunately, it's not really my choice. It's the fire that's been burning for the last month and a half.
[00:10:07] <Nanobot> I've tried sealing the cracks around the doors, running air purifiers, wearing N-95 masks indoors... there's still the constant smell of smoke, and I'm using tylenol to deal with the headaches.
[00:11:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> yab
[00:11:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's probably not good for your health.

[00:11:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sealing is probably not enough because houses really aren't made sealed in general.
[00:12:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Why, a lot of houses don't even include a directional output valve the stove exhaust fan thing.
[00:12:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So if you live next to a parking lot... why yes I'm talking from personal experience.
[00:12:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Fuck apartments facing parking lots. Don't ever take those.)
[00:13:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At least not near ground-level.

[00:18:20] <Nanobot> See the Dixie fire at the top of the "Active Fires of Interest"? That's the one near where I live, where the smoke is coming from.
[00:19:09] <Bco1981> maan that beat
[00:19:35] <TsundereNoises> I guess it wouldn't be summer without Nanobot getting smoked out of his house
[00:19:54] <Nanobot> The Dixie fire is the largest single wildfire in California history. It's almost exactly twice as large as the second largest single wildfire in California history.
[00:19:59] <Bco1981> would sound awesome on some beefy speakers.
[00:20:21] <Nanobot> (the second largest was last year)
[00:20:36] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: how does the big one that almost burned down your town a couple years back rate?
[00:20:39] <TsundereNoises> 3rd?
[00:21:10] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: That was the deadliest wildfire in California history, but not even in the top 20 in terms of size.
[00:21:26] *** Quits: emmeka (~emmeka@162-251-198-66.dynamic.parolink.net) (Quit: c'est en se plantant, qu'on devient cultivé)
[00:22:02] <Nanobot> The problem is it started right outside a major town and just engulfed the entire town with basically no warning. It was early in the morning and the whole town just lit up like a match.
[00:22:43] <Nanobot> For reference, the town was literally in the middle of a forest, in the mountains.
[00:24:10] <Nanobot> That fire killed 85 people. The second deadliest fire in California history killed 29.
[00:24:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Other than filtering there's not really much you can actually do.
[00:24:19] <davic> Bco1981: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGWhZptUnNU&t=509s is nice too

[00:24:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you could at least figure out the infiltration sources you could filter more effectively before it spreads inside but...
[00:25:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Complete sealing isn't great either, you'd have to monitor air quality more carefully and buy controlled release filled gas-cans (because just opening the door is likely not going to help in this case).
[00:26:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nanobot: Oh right. I must mention that N95 masks are absolutely useless for gas filtration
[00:26:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Get yourself some proper organic vapor filters.
[00:26:51] <Nanobot> The largest wildfires in California history, including wildfire complexes (where multiple wildfires merged together) were in: 2020, 2021, 2018, 2020, 2020, 2020, 2020, 2017, 2003, 2012, 2013, 2007, and then 1932.
[00:27:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Problem with proper chemical filters is that they're expensive.
[00:28:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> On positive side of things, I've found that enabling zstd compression on btrfs filesystems and defragging with it has some pretty nice results.
[00:29:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also if you host VMs, remember to enable an IO backend that allow TRIM/UNMAP and to setup fstrim to run periodically so the images don't bloat uselessly. libvirt's defaults don't enable it for performance reasons, but that reason only makes sense if you're mounting your filesystems with 'discard', if you're batching it shouldn't be a problem.

[00:57:40] <theholyduck> lastonestanding:  few reasons first of all plenty of other places do get tornados
[00:57:46] <theholyduck> but they arent as big for various reasons 
[00:58:21] <theholyduck> as i understand a big one for the us is a) its far south enough to have some real heat going on. far north enough to have some cold going on
[00:58:31] <theholyduck> and no mountains inbetween

[01:01:03] <theholyduck> lastonestanding:  like tornados are generally formed by collisions of really warm  air and really cold air
[01:01:33] <lastonestanding> I thought that is how thunder storms are created
[01:01:44] <theholyduck> also true
[01:02:08] <theholyduck> lastonestanding: tornados generally come FROM a thunderstorm
[01:02:17] <theholyduck> like a real big one
[01:03:09] <lastonestanding> nice
[01:03:28] <theholyduck> anyways we do get tornados in other places but they are rarely AS big
[01:03:37] <theholyduck> but like just the other day there were tornados in germany 
[01:03:47] <lastonestanding> no
[01:03:58] <lastonestanding> I have not seen a tornado
[01:04:14] <theholyduck> a tornado is still a relativly local event

[01:05:41] <theholyduck> like theres been a few tornados in germany this month
[01:06:08] <lastonestanding> those look harmless
[01:06:35] <theholyduck> as are most tornados? 
[01:06:49] <theholyduck> like i explained to you why the us gets ESPECIALLY strong tornados in that 1 area
[01:06:56] <lastonestanding> and we have houses made out of stone
[01:07:01] <theholyduck> and what the conditions for creating a tornado are
[01:07:07] <lastonestanding> not those paper buildings like in the US
[01:07:24] <theholyduck> they do happen in europe aswell
[01:07:29] <theholyduck> but they are generally much less powerful
[01:07:41] <theholyduck> because we dont have a tornado alley 
[01:07:58] <lastonestanding> apparently, japan has tornados too, yet you never hear of those...
[01:09:27] <theholyduck> again i dont think their tornados are especially big. and i imagine they are mostly dwarfed by their typhoons
[01:09:38] <theholyduck> japan gets big typhoons

[01:14:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> lastonestanding: Tbh, if housing market wasn't lowest bidder, tornado resistant architecture is definitely feasible.
[01:16:10] <Jigsy> But if houses were tornado proof, how would builders get work?
[01:16:39] <Jigsy> Tornados are just natures way of keeping people in a job.
[01:17:26] <lastonestanding> similar to how we humans have to eat and stores keep selling us food?
[01:17:44] <Jigsy> Exactly.

[01:18:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Meh.
[01:18:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The breakdown wouldn't occur for economic reasons.

[01:21:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Star Trek actually provides an easy solution to the extremist problem. Which is that fucking off in space is pretty easy if you have a larger replicator.
[01:21:44] <TsundereNoises> how do I get a cute lion girl to get a cute alcoholic snow elf girlfriend
[01:22:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But even then... you just need one asshole to make self-guided antimatter warheads.
[01:22:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically, if you don't come up with some partial-loss-resistant backup scheme for people's minds, it's probably going to end horribly.

[01:50:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Huh?
[01:51:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Cyberware, life-extension and bioware are very strongly restricted.
[01:51:08] <amigojapan> Sorry. I thought that is what you meant Aurora_v_kosmose 
[01:51:56] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: live extension does not seem like a problem in the start trek universe
[01:51:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I also think it's hypocritical for the Federation to hold that everyone must die "because" and ban life-extension research.

[01:58:08] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I think if we are stuck on earth. Biological life extension would be bad at a certain point. It would become unsustainable
[01:58:43] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: unless you ban reproduction
[01:58:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Limiting births might become necessary once saturation is reached.
[01:59:02] <amigojapan> Right
[01:59:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm not sure if suicides or voluntary passing might not provide not-too-slow queue anyway.
[02:00:39] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: if medicine advanced to the point where suffering is completely eliminated. I don't see why people would want to die
[02:01:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Boredom.
[02:01:41] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: accidents would probably be the only cause of death
[02:01:58] <amigojapan> Ok
[02:02:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But I suspect uploading would be reached long before that's actually a problem.
[02:02:13] <amigojapan> Yeah maybe, after a very long time

[02:05:08] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: how would that solve boredom?
[02:05:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: It wouldn't solve that. It would solve the material & energetic saturation problem.
[02:05:44] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[02:06:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Boredom would require either a change of point of opinion, memory alteration or other structural alteration.
[02:07:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The first being more based on current psychology and interplay of hobbies, philosophy & etc.
[02:08:02] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: it would also be a bit like the transporter problem. If the consciousness on the cloud is you or. How would you get rid of the phisical body? And would it be murder?
[02:08:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Your memories and general utility function define you.
[02:08:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So it's you until it's turned on. Then it's you/twin with N derivation.
[02:08:44] <amigojapan> No I don't agree

[02:09:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> By utility function I don't mean utilitarian function, I mean how your thoughts, motivations and general behavior express themselves after computation in your mind.
[02:09:41] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: if that were so. A person who suffers from amnesia would no longer be the same person. But we treat them as if they are
[02:09:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Yes, that is indeed a mistake we commonly make.
[02:10:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Major anterograde (sp?) amnesia like caused by late alzheimer (sp?)... that person is not who they were. Neither right before the disease, or decades prior (which are the memories that best remain when they have moments of lucidity)
[02:11:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Our legal and social systems are not built to consider mutable identity and partial identity-sharing.
[02:11:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's a design flaw.
[02:11:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But an understandable one, born of the complexity of those issues and the limited manners in which they tend to express themselves.
[02:12:23] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: that is only cause it is a hard way to function. But let's say a 20yo develops amnesia from hitting his head. He is still the same person
[02:13:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No. He occupies the same body, but if he thinks significantly differently, he is a different person.
[02:13:12] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I think someone with Alzheimer's is still the same person too
[02:13:24] <amigojapan> I disagree
[02:13:55] <amigojapan> The person is the soul that inhabits the body, not the memories
[02:14:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Until we can demonstrate the soul, it isn't a meaningful consideration.
[02:14:22] <amigojapan> I have a mental experiment to prove it
[02:14:47] *** Quits: riposte (~finalripo@2403-5800-3200-5c02--310.ip6.aussiebb.net) (Quit: Quitting)
[02:16:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Actually, the soul would complicate that even further. Because it would represent a metastructure that contains the entirety of identity transition states of the utility function across all of time.
[02:16:30] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: if someone offered you a billion dollars, but you had a condition that at 80 years old you would get amnesia and you knew it. But the condition for getting the money was that after you got abnesia, you would be tortured until death, would you take the money?
[02:17:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No, I hope to live much further than that, and agreeing would be signing my death warant.
[02:17:41] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: but assume you could not avoid that fait
[02:17:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If the condition cannot be fixed by then, I'll simply arrange sufficient materials to overdose when near the end-date.
[02:18:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> This is both out of personal preference and because consigning some random innocent to be torture to death is rather awful.
[02:18:19] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: it's just a thought experiment
[02:18:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Then the last part of my statement mostly applies. It doesn't matter who, consigning them to such a fate for no reason than monetary gain is unconcionable.
[02:18:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (spelling fuarked again)
[02:19:10] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: to see if you are ok with you being tortured after losing all your memories
[02:19:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's actually worse with the memory loss, because it means you'd be willing to condemn any random person to that fate for money.
[02:19:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Without, you can at least claim you consented.
[02:20:12] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: at the ethics aside
[02:20:21] <amigojapan> Set the ethics aside
[02:20:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The question kinda breaks down though without those.
[02:20:49] <amigojapan> The question is "would you be you after abnesia?"
[02:21:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If the change is sufficient, no.
[02:21:33] <amigojapan> Well then I can't agree with your
[02:21:40] <amigojapan> Position
[02:22:04] <amigojapan> I think you are still the same person even if you lose all your memories
[02:22:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Identity the way society and legal systems refer to it is, to simplify it, basically a pointer.
[02:22:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It says nothing about the state of what's behind that pointer, or how much it may or may not resemble what it was first assigned to.
[02:22:58] <amigojapan> Society and law can easily be wrong too Aurora_v_kosmose 
[02:23:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> State is identity, in the way I understand it.
[02:23:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> While society & law divorce the two
[02:24:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> To oversimplify, fire is fire because of what it is, not because of whatever you call it in France or Russia.

[02:34:28] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: the "self or soul" may be produced by the phisical brain, I am not sure, but I am sure it exists and is separate from the memories we may have
[02:35:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If it is, then it is separate from the limitations of matter, and there's no reason to assume it cannot be attached to multiple instances at once, or to things other than meat.
[02:35:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So any given instance has no particular proven value from that point either.

[02:42:08] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: so the actual physical matter does not matter as much as the pattern we are made of
[02:42:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As far as we can tell, at least by some hypotheses I'm not sure if they've been verified (I don't follow physics that closely), matter and particles are very specific self-stable wavepatterns.

[02:42:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I probably mangled it, I don't read much up on physics.
[02:43:52] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: I mean waves like actual waves in the ocean. Any particular wave is made out of particular matter, but the actually have is the structure
[02:44:11] <amigojapan> Wave
[02:44:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I was thinking more of electromagnetics.
[02:44:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But both are bad approximations, I suspect.
[02:44:47] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: as a wave travels down the ocean. It is made of different atoms of water
[02:45:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It can be traced backwards, but what if you copy it exactly, but somewhere else, with different features in its path?
[02:45:45] <amigojapan> So only the structure defines what the same wave is. Not the matter
[02:45:53] <Thymo> Are there any good animes about physics?
[02:45:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's only teh same until the structure starts to differ.

[03:14:09] <theholyduck> like raid 10ing everything i think makes less sense and less sense the more drives you put into the damn thing 
[03:14:27] <theholyduck> because at some point the server itself could catch on fire or the house its in does so. etc
[03:15:09] <theholyduck> i think 3 drives failing faster than you can rebuild the array especially as if you are remotely serious you allready have disks ready for the rebuild on hand. 
[03:15:36] <theholyduck> and instead you should focus on keeping a backup somewhere nowhere near you

[03:29:32] <Nanobot> I guess I'll just never eat yogurt again. The last four times I ordered yogurt from the grocery store, it arrived already expired.
[03:29:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nanobot: Complain and/or report them
[03:29:57] <Nanobot> I did
[03:30:06] <Nanobot> Got a refund.
[03:33:19] <TsundereNoises> but yogurt is good like months past the expiration date
[03:33:24] <TsundereNoises> it's more a best by date
[03:33:55] <Nanobot> Not here. It usually starts getting rancid even before the expiration date.
[03:34:16] <Nanobot> Like, to where it begin puffing up.
[03:34:20] <Nanobot> *begins
[03:34:27] <TsundereNoises> are they just leaving it unrefridgerated for weeks?
[03:34:53] <TsundereNoises> I've eaten yogurt that was like 3 months past the best by date and it tasted perfectly fine
[03:34:55] <Nanobot> I don't know, but I've always had issues with dairy products going bad before the expiration date.
[03:35:00] <TsundereNoises> it was in the fridge all that time though
[03:35:12] <TsundereNoises> milk goes bad before the date here sometimes
[03:35:36] <TsundereNoises> but yogurt is like mayo or sour cream, it's got a MUCH longer shelf life
[03:35:50] <Nanobot> Like, if you go to the grocery store and buy milk that expires in two days, there's a good chance that it'll be nasty that same day.
[03:35:51] <TsundereNoises> I know mayo isn't dairy, but same idea
[03:36:02] <TsundereNoises> yeah, that's true here too
[03:36:08] <TsundereNoises> with milk I mean
[03:36:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Here you're usually good until the date. But uh... afterward no.
[03:36:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Except for products that don't need refrigeration, ofc.
[03:36:48] <Nanobot> The yogurt I got today has a best buy date of today, and the seals are all puffing out.
[03:36:59] <TsundereNoises> that's weird
[03:37:05] <TsundereNoises> like that must be improper storage
[03:37:15] *** Joins: Thymo (~Thymo@NASSP/developer/Thymo)
[03:37:15] <TsundereNoises> because yogurt really has a MUCH longer shelf life than milk
[03:37:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's some yogurts where it's normal and intended, but the problem is when it happens with those where it isn't.
[03:37:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Kefir outgassing? Perfectly normal, if it isn't it's dead.
[03:38:22] <TsundereNoises> you wouldn't think climate would matter much if things were kept in the fridge
[03:38:39] <Nanobot> Even before it starts puffing up, the taste turns sour like old milk.
[03:38:57] <TsundereNoises> like I'm not questioning Nanobot's bad experience, but I'm questioning what the fuck is up with the store
[03:39:02] <TsundereNoises> or maybe it's a weird yogurt
[03:39:17] <Nanobot> This store has always had quality issues. It's a Safeway.
[03:39:29] <Nanobot> Their ground beef has chunks of cartilage in it.
[03:39:45] <Nanobot> Like, chunks big enough to choke on
[03:39:46] <TsundereNoises> I haven't gotten food from a safeway since I moved away from CA like 8 or 9 years ago
[03:40:07] <TsundereNoises> and yeah, I remember going into one and being unable to find any non-shit cheese once
[03:40:15] <TsundereNoises> which is impressive
[03:41:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I suspect it's entirely on the store
[03:41:21] <Nanobot> You should never buy anything from Safeway's "Signature" store brand. It's all complete garbage.

[03:42:30] <Nanobot> For only 80% the cost!

[03:44:09] <TsundereNoises> I was looking or mozzarella to make pizza
[03:44:24] <TsundereNoises> and they did not have ANY mozzarella in the store that wasn't rock hard, for any price or brand

[10:14:17] <Omega037> amigojapan, i played around with it and it works...though the Kindle is kinda small
[10:14:58] <Omega037> I got my son hooked on One Piece and Naruto, but the library is missing volumes and even Amazon/ebay dont have copies of some later volumes
[10:15:01] <amigojapan> I see Omega037 
[10:15:05] <Omega037> So I am going to load some on a kindle for him
[10:15:28] <amigojapan> Omega037: get him hooked on good Anime
[10:15:30] <Omega037> If that is too small we can maybe use our ancient ipad
[10:15:42] <Omega037> He watches enough TV
[10:15:54] <Omega037> Manga/Graphic novels were his gateway into reading
[10:16:11] <amigojapan> I see
[10:16:41] <amigojapan> Naruto and one piece are the worst
[10:17:40] <Omega037> He is 7
[10:17:53] <Omega037> Honestly, we were hesitant for those because they are kinda violent
[10:18:09] <Omega037> He has read quite a few other, safer manga and graphic novels
[10:18:12] <Omega037> Like Dr Stone
[10:18:15] <amigojapan> He could read kino no tabi or something
[10:18:44] <amigojapan> Well it is violent
[10:19:56] <amigojapan> Omega037: classics like Heidi or family Robinson
[10:20:16] <amigojapan> Those are not violent
[10:20:29] <Omega037> He reads quite a bit, and I will load the Kindle with some good stuff
[10:21:17] <amigojapan> Ok

[14:36:28] <MootPoot> namm100:  yeah I know how to install it, I'll do it in a bit
[14:36:56] <KatrinValerie> brtfs stands for brot file system, brot is the german word for bread, that's totally what the acronym officially stands for
[14:37:00] <Bco1981> NTFS-3G?
[14:37:26] <Bco1981> oh, something mac related
[14:37:43] <KatrinValerie> fuse is neat
[14:37:52] <namm100> plan 9 os is best os
[14:37:58] <namm100> so elegant
[14:38:02] <KatrinValerie> While you are at it you can also install mtp daemons on your mac
[14:38:12] <Bco1981> the only mac i like is mac'n'cheese... or big mac.
[14:38:20] <KatrinValerie> It is so annoying that MacOS does not want to talk to mtp things out of the box
[14:38:52] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I told MootPoot about fuse a while ago
[14:38:52] <MootPoot> tf is a mtp daemon
[14:39:08] <MootPoot> a daemon is just like a slave process right
[14:39:10] <MootPoot> mtf?
[14:39:14] <MootPoot> mtp?

[14:39:44] <namm100> great music player
[14:40:35] <amigojapan> MootPoot: this is why several servers are called somethingD like httpd or ircd
[14:40:48] <namm100> httpd is nice

[14:41:21] <namm100> i used to have a website
[14:41:30] <namm100> but i primarily used nginx
[14:41:31] <MootPoot> Bco1981:  oh so like the MTP that you use for getting stuff off/on your phone from a PC?
[14:41:46] <Bco1981> Media Transfer Protocol... can be used to transfer media files to and from many mobile phones... have you heard of ftp or samba ??
[14:41:48] <namm100> i want to program again but, idk
[14:42:00] <namm100> programming is fun but, i guess i can try to wwrite tetris 
[14:42:11] <MootPoot> Bco1981:  yeah these days I just use SMB for that
[14:42:15] <Bco1981> but noooo, MacOS can't using something they didn't make
[14:42:21] <Bco1981> be*
[14:42:31] <MootPoot> but sometimes when I dont have my home network around I suck it up and use MTP
[14:42:37] <Bco1981> "we have to make our own cryptic shit"

[14:57:25] <MootPoot> I have a theory it has to do with the latency or something
[14:57:39] <MootPoot> since with SMB the speed doesnt go full blast in the start
[14:57:42] <MootPoot> it ramps up

[14:58:18] <MootPoot> A few high end phones have like usb 3.2, which would make cable faster

[16:23:42] <amigojapan> Nah, not this time, it is just a joke she would tell me when I was a kid
[16:23:49] <TsundereNoises> also I wonder if "lie" isn't kind of a harsher word in English?

[16:25:07] <amigojapan> It is the deminutive of "lie

[16:25:13] <MootPoot> emmeka:  join the club
[16:25:17] <MootPoot> LMAO
[16:25:28] <TsundereNoises> I am drowning in coffee and muffins
[16:25:36] <MootPoot> new season of kobiyashi is really not leaving any stone turned over
[16:25:38] <MootPoot> I like it
[16:25:40] <amigojapan> emmeka: hope not very painful
[16:25:47] <TsundereNoises> I made some pretty good muffins,but I'm experimenting
[16:26:23] <amigojapan> MootPoot: still kyoani? Made after the fire?
[16:26:29] <MootPoot> dunno
[16:26:30] <emmeka> amigojapan yeah.
[16:26:34] <emmeka> still KyoAni
[16:26:34] <MootPoot> I dont pay attention to that stuff
[16:26:41] <amigojapan> Ty emmeka 
[16:26:44] <emmeka> MootPoot you should, because it's KyoAni.
[16:26:46] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I mean, for example, "liar" seems like it's a much harder word than "嘘つき," I wonder if a similar thing is true in Spanish
[16:26:55] <MootPoot> emmeka:  but why
[16:27:09] <MootPoot> there's literally no point in me knowing or caring; I try everything anyways
[16:27:09] <amigojapan> Yeah probably TsundereNoises 
[16:27:18] <MootPoot> so its not like I filter it like you lot do
[16:27:40] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: mentirita is like "little lie"
[16:27:43] <emmeka> MootPoot it's good to know what the percentage chances are that the studio will shit the bed on you
[16:27:49] <MootPoot> but why
[16:27:55] <emmeka> with KyoAni you're nearly garaunteed something watcheable
[16:28:11] <MootPoot> but yeah I just try it all lol
[16:28:22] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: do you really though?
[16:28:26] <MootPoot> yes
[16:28:36] <emmeka> well w/e you can go through life watching every single anime blindly and not knowing or caring about the studios that make it, and then ending up in situations like being surprised that Dragon Maid looks good.
[16:28:40] <emmeka> you do you.
[16:28:42] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I seem to remember in the past you weren't tryig some stuff I was liking and I gave you shit about it
[16:28:50] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: but I've watched 0 shows this year
[16:28:56] <MootPoot> Every season I go through all the anime for at least 1 episode
[16:29:08] <emmeka> what a terrible methodology
[16:29:22] <MootPoot> emmeka:  you're saying that like being surprised that something looks good is a bad thing
[16:29:24] <TsundereNoises> I mean, I used to watch the first like 3 of twice as many shows as I really had time for
[16:29:42] <TsundereNoises> but not all, it was filtered by chances of being shit
[16:29:51] <emmeka> MootPoot it's a KyoAni series. You should have gone into it *knowing* that it would look stellar
[16:29:55] <MootPoot> if the first ep is even a 4 or 5/10 for me I'll try it at least one
[16:29:59] <MootPoot> more ep
[16:29:59] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: so do you try the new precure show every year, or just one once
[16:30:26] <emmeka> also there's definitely been lots of shows that I've been watching that MootPoot hasn't been, so idk
[16:30:28] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: If I recognize the series as one I dont care for I'll pass on it ( but only after having tried the series at least once )
[16:30:39] <beaky> yes even the hardcore bayesian lesswrong folk know that if its a kyoani series u gotta update the priors to the max. the studio that made k-on the best anime ever
[16:30:39] <TsundereNoises> also yeah, worst KyoAni gets is like 3.5/5
[16:30:50] <MootPoot> emmeka:  like what

[16:31:24] <beaky> gura has nice teeth
[16:31:31] <amigojapan> MootPoot: for madoka you would need to watch 3 episodes before anything important happens
[16:31:55] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: I've been slowly realizing that Ina is best without actually watching any Ina streams
[16:32:03] <emmeka> lol beaky, I'm just imagining some dork out there writing up equations using bayesian theorem to choose which seasonal anime to watch
[16:32:13] <emmeka> and like, I feel certain someone must have actually done this
[16:32:13] <TsundereNoises> Madoka is a bit weird in that sense though
[16:32:25] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: her soma playthrough was nice.
[16:32:37] <Bco1981> just finished it today
[16:32:40] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: she just speaks so much English though
[16:32:48] <MootPoot> I mean at least its better then pre filtering out like half the shows just based on the description and the poster like some of you lot do
[16:33:05] <Bco1981> yeah, but she is actully a cute girl. one of the few.
[16:33:27] <MootPoot> The shows that you've watched that I haven't are either from way before I started doing this way, or I tried and dont care about ( like akasuki no yona )
[16:33:29] <emmeka> MootPoot I think that's a pretty flawed methodology though, given there are plenty of shows that grabbed me on ep 1 but then immediately went down the gutter, and plenty of shows that have a longer burn and reveal nothing in the first episode but that hook you over time and end up being fantastic
[16:33:30] <TsundereNoises> when I'm actually trying anime, I only pre-filter by "I have never liked any show like this, I'll try it later if someone else says it's AMAZING"
[16:33:34] <TsundereNoises> it's just there's a lot of that
[16:33:53] <TsundereNoises> I do believe there's an exception and some good show could be made in any subgenre
[16:33:56] <MootPoot> emmeka:  then I drop them on the episode where it becomes shit lol
[16:34:09] <emmeka> this does not solve the latter category
[16:34:12] <MootPoot> for shows that ramp up, their first ep has to be at least 4 or 5/10
[16:34:16] <MootPoot> so I end up watching it anyways
[16:34:22] <beaky> gotta filter by how kawaii the girl in the poster is. no girl in poster = no watch (but bonus if the cute girl is actually a boy like hibari-kun)
[16:34:41] <TsundereNoises> yeah I think I drop a lot of shows around like episode 4
[16:34:46] <TsundereNoises> that seemed promising at the start
[16:34:59] <emmeka> TsundereNoises and I are once again the same, my basic methodology is that I watch most things where I know the genre is right up my alley and there isn't some obvious red flag that I won't like it. Everything else, I wait for other people's advice.
[16:35:21] <emmeka> there's lots of shows I'd never think to watch that end up being favourites just because someone else recommended it
[16:35:31] <MootPoot> The only possible way I could end up passing on a good show even if it ramps up later on is if the first episode is literally trash ( 3/10 or below )
[16:35:42] <TsundereNoises> beaky: when the poster is just a bunch of girls, but then there's a male protagonist that wasn't on the poster, it seems like false advertising
[16:35:45] <TsundereNoises> I drop that shit right away
[16:35:46] <MootPoot> in which case I hightly doubt a show with a 3/10 first ep will be any better for me later on
[16:36:10] <emmeka> but anyway MootPoot idk why you'd be vehemently opposed to understanding a bit about the major studios and what to expect from them
[16:36:12] <beaky> yes lots of shows deceive us that way like kemurikusa
[16:36:20] <beaky> worst is 'yuri on ice'
[16:36:42] <TsundereNoises> beaky: yeah but "yuri" on ice was okay because it was still super gay
[16:36:42] <Bco1981> don't expect
[16:36:42] <emmeka> it'd be like watching western animation without knowing that Disney exists, or caring what the creator worked on previously
[16:36:44] <MootPoot> emmeka:  1.) when did I say or imply I was vehemently opposed to anything 2.) My only issue is that theres literally no reason for me to bother, since I try it all anyway
[16:36:49] <amigojapan> emmeka: MootPoot is extreme in many ways
[16:37:02] <MootPoot> Like, I have nothing to gain 
[16:37:10] <MootPoot> from learning about studios, VA's directors, etc
[16:37:12] <Bco1981> if you have expectation you will very often be disapointed.
[16:37:17] <Bco1981> don't expect
[16:37:24] <emmeka> <MootPoot> there's literally no point in me knowing or caring
[16:37:29] <emmeka> seems vehement
[16:37:38] <TsundereNoises> director is maybe the biggest decider for me actually, moreso than studio
[16:37:40] <MootPoot> seems like you have a bone to pick emmeka 
[16:37:46] <emmeka> I do!
[16:38:00] <MootPoot> It's an irrelevant bone, so you can keep it on your plate
[16:38:01] <MootPoot> I'm good
[16:38:08] <TsundereNoises> I sometimes watch stuff just because of the cast, but there are a lot of things that are absolute shit that somehow get a great cast
[16:38:26] <emmeka> imagine watching seasonal anime but not knowing about KyoAni. it hurts me.

[16:39:01] <amigojapan> MootPoot: when you say 3/10 I hope you are talking about your own opinion, and not going by ratings
[16:39:14] <TsundereNoises> it's pretty clear he was
[16:39:47] <TsundereNoises> brb I need a coffee refill
[16:39:50] <MootPoot> Its not like I'm unique in anime for this
[16:40:04] <MootPoot> I treat manga, normal movies, books, TV shows, games all the same way
[16:40:12] <MootPoot> I just dont really see any value in bothering
[16:40:18] <emmeka> I'm less particular about seiyuu, but I watch a decent proportion of dubs. sure there's a few seiyuu that if I hear them I'm more likely to stick around, but there's a lot of rookie performances which are stellar too so I try not to put too much stock in it.
[16:40:25] <MootPoot> ALTHOUGH , I give anime the credit of trying everything once
[16:40:33] <beaky> nice i like dubs too
[16:40:35] <MootPoot> I dont have the time / effort / money to do that with other stuff like games
[16:40:42] <emmeka> MootPoot you pick books completely blind to the author who wrote them???
[16:40:50] <MootPoot> yes
[16:41:08] <emmeka> well there is no helping you
[16:41:11] <MootPoot> I know the author of them sometimes
[16:41:13] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: for me, the reason is there are more books than I'll ever be able to read, more movies and anime than I'll ever be able to watch
[16:41:17] <TsundereNoises> so I NEED a way to find the gems
[16:41:19] <MootPoot> I just dont care
[16:41:41] <TsundereNoises> and I still think everyone (including me) misses things they'd love
[16:41:53] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I bet MootPoot only reads new books

[16:57:32] <emmeka> sometimes breeders can be cute too
[16:57:33] <TsundereNoises> I really liked Joker, but then I started to get frustrated by the internet about it
[16:57:42] * MootPoot goes back to watching kobayashi s2
[16:57:51] <amigojapan> name100: no. I am not sure what you want to say
[16:57:55] <Urchin[emacs]> I just found Joker meh
[16:58:01] <name100> i want to say beer is very good amigojapan 
[16:58:07] <amigojapan> Hola beaky 
[16:58:14] <beaky> hola
[16:58:21] <beaky> beery good
[16:58:23] <TsundereNoises> people treated Joker like it was the best thing ever, and got really upset about it not getting awards (when movies that they hadn't seen but were certainly better won awards instead)
[16:58:33] <amigojapan> name100: biiru ga tottemo ii yo
[16:58:51] <MootPoot> Parasite was the same for me
[16:58:52] <beaky> nice sounds just like yukihana lamy
[16:59:14] <amigojapan> Name tottemo is very, ii is good, yo is !
[16:59:16] <MootPoot> I tend to just enjoy stuff mroe when I dont go in expecting anything because so and so director crap
[16:59:38] <TsundereNoises> especially with movies though, the director is the single best predictor of whether I'll like a movie or not
[16:59:52] <TsundereNoises> there are lots of directors where every movie they make is good
[16:59:59] <TsundereNoises> and lots where they have made nothing but shit in 20 years
[17:00:12] <TsundereNoises> much moreso than actors or anything else
[17:00:14] <name100> ok thx
[17:00:33] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: that's like common sense
[17:00:41] <name100> yo is like an exclamation mark
[17:00:45] <emmeka> amigojapan you'd think.
[17:00:53] <emmeka> but MootPoot is currently arguing against it.
[17:01:00] <amigojapan> Yes, at the end of the sentence name

[17:02:43] <amigojapan> Who are you talking to MootPoot ?
[17:02:59] <MootPoot> that was directed to emmeka, if it wasen't clear enough
[17:03:01] <TsundereNoises> I read something extremely stupid online the other day and I can't stop thinking about it
[17:03:17] <MootPoot> anyway, changing topics
[17:03:22] <emmeka> that's not really putting words in your mouth, you did call it gatekeeping to even acknowledge a preference for certain creators or to even be knowledgeable about what creators might be worth your time
[17:03:42] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  I tried reading old boomer books like the wealth of nations
[17:03:43] <TsundereNoises> I saw someone say "i tried to translate a japanese sentence to english sentence on my own and it seems that there are some little differences to the one i translated using online translator.i dont know if it is normal or if i just suck in translating sentences or the online translator are not really accurate."
[17:03:44] <MootPoot> it was terrible
[17:03:52] <MootPoot> how do people get through stuff like that
[17:03:54] <TsundereNoises> like how does someone have this little clue about how language works
[17:04:09] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: no one actually gets through wealth of nations
[17:04:16] <TsundereNoises> I don't believe it
[17:04:39] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: they may be trolling
[17:04:49] <emmeka> jokes on you, I read all of Das Kapital... pretty sure I forfeited most of my lifeforce in the process, though
[17:05:00] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: no, this is the kind of idiot who is 100% serious and just really clueless about everything
[17:05:28] <MootPoot> okay, last statement, I called it gatekeeping about avoiding stuff that you dont like the director / poster / cast for, not gatekeeping for having a preference. Although, I admit I could have stated that clearer
[17:05:44] <MootPoot> you can have preferences for genres or styles all you want
[17:05:44] <amigojapan> Alright TsundereNoises , they may be beyond help
[17:05:48] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: your sacrifice is appreciated
[17:06:16] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah I see stuff like this every day, people just so confused about the basics of how language works
[17:06:22] <TsundereNoises> I WISH they were all trolls
[17:06:38] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises 
[17:06:41] <MootPoot> I used to be into spy books and stuff
[17:06:44] <emmeka> translation is lossy, there's no way around the fact that a portion of it is always style and interpretation
[17:06:45] <MootPoot> back as a kid
[17:06:48] <MootPoot> they were cool
[17:07:06] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: there's a director who has made 5 movies before, I watched 2 and they were 2 of the worst movies I ever saw, absolutely no one liked the other 3, he has a new movie coming out
[17:07:14] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: you think I should give that a try or I'm gatekeeping?
[17:07:59] <MootPoot> I remember one about where a US pilot gets shot down but hes actually a red indian or something and then he gets chased across siberia by a russian tracker dude 
[17:08:00] <emmeka> I have done some translation work, and I remember my first attempts at it taking way too long and resulting in English that didn't flow in a very English-sounding way, because I was trying to preserve sentence structure in ways that I shouldn't have
[17:08:00] <MootPoot> it was cool
[17:08:07] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I translated a sentence and it came out coherent, not like Google Translate, am I doing it wrong?
[17:08:16] <emmeka> and I learned that to do translation well, you have to do it less rigidly.
[17:08:31] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  its a form of gatekeeping, I wouldn't attach a negative connotation to gatekeeping here like there is in typical usage.
[17:08:38] <Urchin[emacs]> a really good translation can surpass the original
[17:08:48] <MootPoot> If it were me, I'd try it out for like 10min or something just to see, if it didnt cost me any money
[17:08:50] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: yeah I keep thinking I want to try translating stuff as a form of practice, then it takes too long and I decide "maybe later"
[17:09:10] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I mean, first I'd say gatekeeping almost HAS to be about other people rather than oneself
[17:09:16] <MootPoot> its okay if you want to select your media by directors, I dont have any issue with it
[17:09:27] <MootPoot> you do you
[17:09:50] <TsundereNoises> I mean, that's how it's generally used
[17:10:08] <TsundereNoises> you don't gatekeep yourself, you gatekeep other people trying to get into your hobby
[17:10:10] <MootPoot> yeah, I just remembered I should clarify that
[17:10:52] <TsundereNoises> I think a little gatekeeping can actually be good, by the way, in the sense I'm talking about with others
[17:11:01] <TsundereNoises> kind of like, there really ARE stupid questions
[17:11:19] <MootPoot> lets swap gatekeeping with....biasing your selections based on experience
[17:11:27] <MootPoot> does that sound more accurate to you?
[17:11:30] <TsundereNoises> sure, in which case I do in fact do that
[17:11:38] <TsundereNoises> I now have no complaint
[17:12:03] <MootPoot> Not everybody has the time or care or effort for putting all the stuff in like I do, and thats 100% fine
[17:12:24] <MootPoot> even I bias my selections outside anime, since I just dont have the ^
[17:12:24] <TsundereNoises> I try to insert some chaos into my selections deliberately
[17:12:37] <emmeka> MootPoot not only is this a pretty terrible way of going about this, the fact that you think acknowledging creators exist and meriting them based on their prior accomplishments is "gatekeeping" is just amazing to me.
[17:12:38] <TsundereNoises> because I don't want to fall into the trap of ONLY reading/watching a small subset of things that are all similar

[17:13:01] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I got him to concede the gatekeeping point though
[17:13:08] <emmeka> still tho
[17:13:20] <emmeka> it's such a strange position to double down on
[17:13:25] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, like I try to read a few books that I wouldn't normal read every so often
[17:13:47] <emmeka> anyway, time to eat food and go debase myself for money, ie, call people and ask for jobs
[17:13:49] <MootPoot> I'm not arguing lol,  why do you keep on trying to turn this into a debate
[17:13:55] <TsundereNoises> good luck emmeka
[17:14:07] <MootPoot> go work you unemployed wageless cuck
[17:14:19] <MootPoot> go make money for the 1% like you're supposed to
[17:14:46] <TsundereNoises> I'm pretty sure even these calls won't make money for the 1%, emmeka is a true hero
[17:15:06] <MootPoot> emmeka is so unproductive him trying actually makes the 1% lose money
[17:15:08] <MootPoot> what a guy
[17:15:09] <MootPoot> what a chad
[17:15:10] <TsundereNoises> more like finding farmers that have soil problems, right?
[17:15:44] * TsundereNoises is disappointed we didn't get to behead any news anchors in Times Square
[17:15:57] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  have you watched shiki
[17:16:10] <MootPoot> I ended up finding it while just trying out anime
[17:16:17] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yeah, I liked it
[17:16:19] <MootPoot> its one of my favs now
[17:16:24] <TsundereNoises> not all time favorite for me, but it's good
[17:16:35] <MootPoot> its the only anime I know that actually nailed the psycological horror
[17:16:45] <TsundereNoises> yeah I was about to say something like that
[17:16:53] <TsundereNoises> horror is one of my all time favorite genres
[17:17:04] <TsundereNoises> and horror anime usually shits the bed
[17:17:12] <TsundereNoises> so the fact that I even liked it is a big thing
[17:17:24] <MootPoot> I would extend that statement TsundereNoises 
[17:17:29] <MootPoot> horror anything usually shits the bed
[17:17:30] <TsundereNoises> I hate most horror anime because I like horror so much
[17:17:36] <TsundereNoises> eh
[17:17:42] <TsundereNoises> there are tons of good horror books and movies
[17:17:54] <MootPoot> not as many as the shit ones
[17:17:56] <TsundereNoises> the difference is, the ones that get big theater releases around halloween tend to be shit
[17:17:59] <MootPoot> hmm
[17:18:00] <MootPoot> maybe
[17:18:08] <MootPoot> horror is either a 2/10 or a 9/10
[17:18:13] <TsundereNoises> or like the books on the best seller lists are actually usually the worst, in horror
[17:18:22] <TsundereNoises> moreso than other genres
[17:18:51] <MootPoot> tbh these days I just treat horror as comedy
[17:18:53] <MootPoot> at this point
[17:18:55] <TsundereNoises> I kind of agree with that, I can think of some average horror, but there are a lot of ones that REALLY fuck up or really nail it
[17:19:04] <MootPoot> watch it in discrod with buddies
[17:19:05] <TsundereNoises> I like horror comedy when it's deliberate
[17:19:06] <MootPoot> and laugh at the shit
[17:19:07] <TsundereNoises> or so bad it's funny
[17:19:17] <TsundereNoises> but I like actual serious horror done well the best
[17:19:25] <MootPoot> hururu
[17:19:28] <TsundereNoises> but like Ash vs. Evil Dead is a good show
[17:19:49] <TsundereNoises> because it just embraces being comedy
[17:21:25] <TsundereNoises> I feel like anime tends to generate more bad horror than good for some stupid reason I'm not clear on

[17:23:40] <TsundereNoises> I guess if I had to define it, I'd define it as something that's attempting to make you feel creeped out

[17:27:26] <amigojapan> :p MootPoot 
[17:27:40] <emmeka> I wasn't aware it needed saving
[17:27:54] <MootPoot> soon you'll be able to upload a few drawnings and a small script
[17:27:58] <MootPoot> give it a week in the datacenter
[17:28:14] <MootPoot> and it will spit out a seasonal 12 episode isekai trash anime for you
[17:28:17] <MootPoot> whats not to love!
[17:28:21] <emmeka> sounds terrible
[17:28:39] <MootPoot> but then all the budget can go to the kyoani script writers
[17:28:41] <MootPoot> which you love
[17:29:16] <TsundereNoises> so someone recommend this comic last week, overall I think it's just okay, nothing special, but this one really speaks to me https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/i-want-to-be-a-cute-anime-girl/67-wait-what-part-2/viewer?title_no=349416&episode_no=68

[17:29:40] <MootPoot> oh that one
[17:29:43] * TsundereNoises is closing tabs
[17:29:43] <MootPoot> I tried that oo
[17:29:47] <emmeka> no, I love the whole process KyoAni uses and that definitively KyoAni style, which you'd know if you knew anything about them!
[17:30:00] <TsundereNoises> yeah I was pretty lukewarm on the comic overall, but that one I just linked…
[17:30:11] <MootPoot> so you're saying kyoani would not be better off with more budget?
[17:30:26] <MootPoot> how dare you speak against kyoani
[17:30:32] <MootPoot> fucking normie
[17:30:33] <TsundereNoises> I want more SHAFT
[17:30:41] * MootPoot gives TsundereNoises  some shaft
[17:30:57] <emmeka> MootPoot I'm saying it'd be better off with like, animators, that it currently animates with.
[17:30:57] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  I tried that comic out for a few chapters, it was okay
[17:31:14] <MootPoot> not interesting enogh to keep reading, dropped it 
[17:31:16] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I agree
[17:31:19] <MootPoot> emmeka:  and those animators dont get paid?
[17:31:31] <MootPoot> using budget?
[17:31:37] <emmeka> yes, and.
[17:31:52] <TsundereNoises> I think emmeka is trying to say that a lot more budget wouldn't really help because they're pretty big budget and work slowly anyway
[17:32:03] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: webtoon is a weird place
[17:32:09] <TsundereNoises> and speeding up would cost quality, even if they increased budget
[17:32:10] <MootPoot> its full of not shit but not good comics
[17:32:21] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yeah, there's only like one on there I've really liked
[17:32:21] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  more money = more projects to work slowly on
[17:32:22] <MootPoot> ez
[17:32:25] <emmeka> he's also saying "give animation work to AI" which, for anyone familiar with the general process of automation, does not typically lead to more human animators.
[17:32:41] <MootPoot> agian, read carefully and stop implying
[17:32:56] <MootPoot> I was in favor of giving seasonal trash to AI
[17:33:13] <MootPoot> being out of a job is really hurting you
[17:33:15] <TsundereNoises> do we actually NEED to make a bunch of trash isekai and harem anime every season?
[17:33:29] <MootPoot> I guess, they do it for some reason
[17:33:39] <DunceCotus> what's harem anime?
[17:33:54] <MootPoot> DunceCotus:  its an anime about one carrot and a lot of peaches in a basket
[17:34:02] <emmeka> MootPoot so when Ford put robotic arms in their factories, the automaking industry hired more workers, right? Less labour to make cars = more money = can spend more on workers?
[17:34:07] <DunceCotus> oh.. yeah those suck
[17:34:11] <TsundereNoises> DunceCotus: when you have 15 cute girls each with one distinguishing characteristic all in love with your protagonist who is too dense to notice
[17:34:39] *** Quits: Aurora_v_kosmose (~LispyLigh@user/lispylights) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:34:50] <MootPoot> unlike cars , the anime industry has plenty of markets to grow into
[17:34:58] <MootPoot> that comparison is broken
[17:35:06] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises: seems like an equisitely japanese situation
[17:35:08] <emmeka> you think the auto industry didn't have expanding markets in the 1970s?
[17:35:09] *** Joins: Aurora_v_kosmose (~LispyLigh@user/lispylights)
[17:35:27] <MootPoot> you're talking about the 70s?
[17:35:35] <MootPoot> say that then 
[17:35:43] <TsundereNoises> that's when they automated
[17:35:56] <MootPoot> I'm sorry for not knowing the history of ford's production lines of the top of my head
[17:35:59] <emmeka> yep. believe it or not, that's when Ford put the first robotic arms in their factories. iirc, the first human killed by a robot died in like 1976, in a Ford factory.
[17:36:01] <DunceCotus> the 70s is when reality started to show its age
[17:36:14] <MootPoot> but anyway, back on topic ; AI = more anime
[17:36:15] <MootPoot> give
[17:36:20] <TsundereNoises> !addquote DunceCotus the 70s is when reality started to show its age
[17:36:20] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: Quote added for DunceCotus (4)
[17:36:47] <emmeka> MootPoot anyway, this is not how it goes. The opposite happens, and always has happened, and will continue to happen. A company that replaces human labour with machines will reduce its workforce, this is the only real reason to bother with the machines in the first place, this is basically an ironclad rule of capitalist production.
[17:36:48] <MootPoot> I want AI to do to anime what unreal engine and unity did for games
[17:37:03] <emmeka> that's a poor comparison
[17:37:58] <MootPoot> a single chap in his basement should be able to make his own anime ( realistically ) with some degree of effort rather then it being effecitvely imposible today unless you're essentially running your own corp
[17:37:59] <TsundereNoises> !seen ButterNoodle
[17:37:59] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: ButterNoodle was last seen in ##anime 8 hours and 35 minutes ago: <ButterNoodle> !quote
[17:38:21] <DunceCotus> the question is whether increasing automation will reduce profits in long-term
[17:38:34] <TsundereNoises> if we ever get to that point, I want to make an anime with emmeka
[17:38:46] <MootPoot> Then I'll say to all the people who complain about anime what I say about games " go make your own then dickwad"
[17:38:47] <DunceCotus> cause profit is at least partially from expropriating surplus value in production  
[17:39:17] <TsundereNoises> cute girls doing cute farming
[17:39:28] <emmeka> DunceCotus yeah, it does. long term inherent flaw of the system we have. tendency of the rate of profit to fall.
[17:39:30] <DunceCotus> you can't really 'exploit' machines
[17:39:48] <TsundereNoises> that's why we need to work on true AI
[17:39:49] <DunceCotus> its always gonna give you the output you expect
[17:39:59] <TsundereNoises> they need to be intelligent so we can exploit them
[17:40:00] <DunceCotus> AI could be game-changer here
[17:40:02] <MootPoot> Ai will save anime 
[17:40:18] <MootPoot> or we'll get a mass influx of even more trash isekai lmao
[17:40:20] <MootPoot> probably that
[17:40:24] <TsundereNoises> that
[17:40:32] <MootPoot> but you'll get a increased supply of good niche shows as well
[17:40:40] <MootPoot> so its all good
[17:40:49] <DunceCotus> an influx of AI-generated nursery rhyme youtube videos
[17:41:01] <TsundereNoises> magical girls shows generally don't have nearly enough kissing
[17:41:05] <TsundereNoises> I would like to fix this
[17:41:24] <MootPoot> we can have the AI make everything  into black and white and look like shit so amigojapan think's its old and he'll actually watch it
[17:41:33] <TsundereNoises> lol
[17:41:46] <TsundereNoises> on that note: watch The Lighthouse
[17:41:47] <name100> crackers
[17:42:04] <name100> what's up, crackers
[17:42:12] <DunceCotus> animal crackers
[17:42:34] <MootPoot> amigojapan if you only like old things why do you eat fresh food and not rotten stuff ?
[17:42:41] <MootPoot> lol
[17:42:55] <DunceCotus> new anime has a certain gloss to it that I don't really like
[17:43:02] <MootPoot> SHINY
[17:43:06] <DunceCotus> the gloss seeps into the plots and characters
[17:43:17] <TsundereNoises> there are still a lot of good new anime
[17:43:19] <DunceCotus> world-building is considered passe
[17:43:39] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises: right, my current fav is Sonny Boy
[17:43:40] <amigojapan> I like some modern anime, but I need to be very selective MootPoot 
[17:43:45] <DunceCotus> its got something really interesting going for it
[17:43:49] <MootPoot> no, no no you cant do that amigojapan 
[17:43:58] <MootPoot> you have to only do old stuff
[17:44:04] <TsundereNoises> like shoujo shuumatsu ryokou has plenty of world building
[17:44:30] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I can do both
[17:44:33] <MootPoot> In fact your computer is too new as well amigojapan , throw it out and I'll mail you my intel 8086
[17:44:44] <TsundereNoises> I stumbled across something extremely degenerate, I'm not sure if I want to keep reading it, but I need to link it to ButterNoodle

[17:46:29] <DunceCotus> shoujo shuumatsu ryokou looks bleak
[17:46:39] <TsundereNoises> correct
[17:46:52] <DunceCotus> oddly cutesy character designs
[17:46:54] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's less bleak than it seems
[17:47:04] <TsundereNoises> it's got tons of worldbuilding, and it's great in basically all ways
[17:47:06] <DunceCotus> in what looks like post-USSR ruins
[17:47:31] <DunceCotus> It's probably no Sonny Boy
[17:47:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: one of my favourite animes
[17:47:46] <emmeka> it's pretty great
[17:47:54] <emmeka> one of the best final episodes of all time, imo
[17:48:02] <amigojapan> Yup
[17:48:09] <MootPoot> golden boy?
[17:48:10] <DunceCotus> the design reminds me of Made in Abyss
[17:48:14] <DunceCotus> is it by same studio?
[17:48:35] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's less depressive than that tho
[17:48:51] <DunceCotus> XD
[17:49:08] <Bco1981> MootPoot: you don't have a 8086...
[17:49:20] <MootPoot> Bco1981:  how do you know if I do or dont
[17:49:33] <Bco1981> you have a museum ?
[17:49:37] <MootPoot> no
[17:50:00] <amigojapan> Bco1981: he is not really interested in vintage computers
[17:50:03] <emmeka> DunceCotus Girls Last Tour isn't tragic, at least. Despite the grayscale art and generally bleak vibe of the whole show, it's basically a slice of life series.
[17:50:13] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  stop lying please
[17:50:28] <MootPoot> Bco1981:  you can get a 8086 from ebay for a few dollars
[17:50:30] <MootPoot> check i tout
[17:50:32] <MootPoot> I have a few
[17:50:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: do you watch the 8 bit guy?
[17:51:01] <Bco1981> yeah i'm sure you can.
[17:51:05] <MootPoot> yes, I do, but also,  that's a shit litmus test lol
[17:51:09] <Bco1981> but why would you want it ?
[17:51:10] <amigojapan> MootPoot: 8086 was a bad computer
[17:51:20] <MootPoot> Bco1981:  just playing around with it
[17:51:21] <MootPoot> tbh
[17:51:26] <DunceCotus> its probably no Angel's Egg
[17:51:33] <MootPoot> becasuse I was interested
[17:52:06] <amigojapan> MootPoot: PCs were always behind the times
[17:52:14] <Bco1981> so you got a motherboard and a AT psu too ? and a fitting keyboard ?
[17:52:28] <amigojapan> MootPoot: commodore was good
[17:52:42] <MootPoot> Bco1981: the 8086 is just a chip
[17:52:47] <SpiritOfSummer> how was commodore good
[17:52:49] <MootPoot> it lives on my breadboard
[17:53:02] <MootPoot> and I used it on my breadboard
[17:53:05] <SpiritOfSummer> wasn't the only thing it could do is play games that were made for it which there were like 3 good ones?
[17:53:09] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: had much better programs
[17:53:14] <MootPoot> I was going to get a moto 6800
[17:53:18] <MootPoot> err, 68000
[17:53:18] <Bco1981> yeah, but how would you play around with it if you can't use it ?
[17:53:20] <SpiritOfSummer> I think I don't know anything about the commodore 
[17:53:28] <SpiritOfSummer> I thought it was a game system
[17:53:32] <MootPoot> Bco1981:  you literally just wire it in on the breadboard
[17:53:33] <name100> I PLAY SNES AS KID
[17:53:33] <MootPoot> thats it
[17:53:35] <name100> WAS SOO GOOD

[17:53:40] <name100> DONKEY KONG COUNTRY 2 
[17:53:42] <name100> BEST GAME
[17:53:47] <SpiritOfSummer> alright dude nice
[17:53:57] <Bco1981> well, i guess that would be easy enough with that old tech.

[17:54:49] <MootPoot> Bco1981:  all you need is a desktop psu for a breadboard, a few parts, and a bunch of wire

[17:55:00] <name100> SpiritOfSummer: ok
[17:55:10] <MootPoot> and that psu is like just 20-50w , of which you dont even come close to using tha tmuch
[17:55:12] <SpiritOfSummer> the oldest most classic game system I have is my sega genesis
[17:55:15] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: there was even a GUI like Windows called geos,I can show you screen shots
[17:55:39] <name100> pls show me too screenshot
[17:56:04] <amigojapan> SpiritOfSummer: the sega genesis did not have a keyboard and programming languages, it was nothing like the C64
[17:56:07] <Bco1981> amigojapan: there is a dosbox fork called dosbox-x that can emulate the japan pc was it nec-98 or something
[17:56:08] <DunceCotus> name100: did you just wake up from cryogenic sleep
[17:56:15] <amigojapan> One sec name100 
[17:56:16] <MootPoot> although, I tore it apart a while later, started breadboarding Atmels since it was simpler
[17:56:42] <Bco1981> and NEC PC-98 emulations so that you can play DOS/V and PC-98 games with it.

[17:58:59] <TsundereNoises> yes, in the past we didn't have nearly enough catgirls
[17:59:01] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: donkey Kong country is too new for me

[17:59:23] <SpiritOfSummer> that's like stuff from when I was a kid

[18:00:14] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: it was for a while
[18:00:15] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: even retirees played Wii Sports
[18:00:22] <DunceCotus> (until they died)
[18:00:27] <SpiritOfSummer> the genesis is absolute fire though
[18:00:36] <SpiritOfSummer> the thing is I don't know what blast processing is
[18:00:54] <SpiritOfSummer> but if I saw genesis gameplay compared to NES, I'd have believed it
[18:01:10] <name100> NES SO BORING
[18:01:19] <SpiritOfSummer> well it's old but yeah
[18:01:20] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I did play Wii sports
[18:01:21] <DunceCotus> NES was groundbreaking
[18:01:24] <DunceCotus> stop complaining
[18:01:31] <SpiritOfSummer> honestly it's not the retro game library I'd have the most fun with 
[18:01:36] <SpiritOfSummer> but yeah it was the big one

[18:01:43] <name100> OCARINA OF TIME
[18:01:45] <SpiritOfSummer> it's the big one to look back on, it started so much
[18:01:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so how is Donkey Kong Country too new?
[18:01:53] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: but I never bought an SNES
[18:02:07] <SpiritOfSummer> DunceCotus: it came out when the people who made it were old enough to be his kids 
[18:02:24] <DunceCotus> doubtful
[18:02:29] <SpiritOfSummer> that's an exaggeration
[18:02:37] <name100> amigojapan: do u like Toshinori Kondo
[18:02:46] <SpiritOfSummer> and I promise I meant that the game developers were underage and that you were not overly old, amigojapan
[18:02:53] <Bco1981> this dosbox-x even officially supports windows 98... and 3dfx!

[18:03:08] <MootPoot> Would you play that 
[18:03:13] <DunceCotus> Bco1981: but does it support Blast Processing
[18:03:20] <MootPoot> Make amigo play LA noire
[18:03:24] <Bco1981> Blast Processing?
[18:03:34] <SpiritOfSummer> blast processing was the sega genesis commercial thing
[18:03:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: sure
[18:03:47] <MootPoot> Bco1981: it's if you run your game for too long your console explodes 
[18:03:54] <Bco1981> since it is made to emulate a dos computer, i doubt it.
[18:03:55] <DunceCotus> not to be confused with Blasé Procession
[18:04:05] <Bco1981> lol
[18:04:18] <Bco1981> MootPoot: that's a shit console :D
[18:04:26] <SpiritOfSummer> if you play sonic 2 you can feel the blast processing
[18:04:37] <DunceCotus> blast processing allows for silky smooth framerates I think
[18:04:39] <SpiritOfSummer> and 3
[18:04:41] <MootPoot> It was implemented because parents were worried about their kids playing too many videos games and melting their brains so the console detonates if you play too long 
[18:04:44] <MootPoot> For safety reasons
[18:04:50] <amigojapan> Bco1981: you know you can even run dosbox on the browser nowdays
[18:04:53] <SpiritOfSummer> yeah I mean I'm sure the genesis might hvae some edge in processing speed
[18:05:00] <SpiritOfSummer> but that doesn't mean blast processing is a real term, rofl
[18:05:07] <Bco1981> amigojapan: yes, but i can't mount my hdd in that
[18:05:11] <DunceCotus> blast processing is actually an industry standard nowadays
[18:05:12] <SpiritOfSummer> the only time saying that was cool was in the runtime of those commercials
[18:05:14] <Bco1981> or iso's
[18:05:31] <SpiritOfSummer> DunceCotus: is it an actually used term?
[18:05:37] <MootPoot> Bco1981: you know what they call gas explosions in the media when houses explode sometimes? That's just a kid playing too long 
[18:05:38] <SpiritOfSummer> in the game making industry I mean?
[18:05:42] <DunceCotus> SpiritOfSummer: no, its now called Intel
[18:05:47] <SpiritOfSummer> lol
[18:05:57] <MootPoot> So the console took itself and the entire house with it 
[18:05:57] <amigojapan> Bco1981: in most cases you will play with it for a short time so you don't really need that
[18:06:02] <DunceCotus> CUDA chipset
[18:06:41] <TsundereNoises> I only want games with EXPLOSION processing
[18:06:45] <MootPoot> All those suicide bombers were just people playing blast processing PSPs or gameboys for too long

[18:47:01] <ButterNoodle> tbh TsundereNoises the only thing is that the CPU on there is over priced.. you can wait around and find it on sale for 100-150 cheaper.. like MootPoot said. camelcamelcamel it
[18:47:11] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: Amazon Japan
[18:47:25] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: he said "new" pc
[18:47:30] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: almost 2 years ago tho
[18:47:46] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: no he did not say that was required
[18:47:51] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I've been relying on shit other people threw away for a long long time now
[18:47:59] <ButterNoodle> if he said a cheap used one, I'd point to a "remarketer" like the one you got from amazon
[18:48:00] <TsundereNoises> I want to finally get something new or at least new-ish
[18:48:13] <MootPoot> OR he could drop down a generation and get a 12 core cpu for a little more if he wants to video edit a lot
[18:48:13] <TsundereNoises> I feel like I HAVE a cheap used computer
[18:48:15] <TsundereNoises> in that it was free
[18:48:24] <TsundereNoises> hmmm
[18:48:32] <TsundereNoises> that might actually be the way to go
[18:48:33] <MootPoot> 40 dollars more takes you from a 8c cpu to a 12
[18:48:37] <MootPoot> from the last gen
[18:48:39] <TsundereNoises> top of the line from last generation kid of thing?
[18:48:41] <ButterNoodle> there are tonnes of off lease business desktops out there in the 2-300$ range but they are all going to be 4 years old+
[18:48:47] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  not top, but second

[18:51:56] <TsundereNoises> I did upgrade the ram, but all it took to "fix" it was wiping it actually

[19:05:31] <MootPoot> not now
[19:05:59] <MootPoot> everything else EXCEPT your gpu can come now. if you really wanna wait they are doing a major refresh in a few months
[19:06:05] <MootPoot> so ddr5, new CPUs etc
[19:06:27] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: how many months? and will that knock down the cost of the current stuff?
[19:06:40] <MootPoot> should be within 1-2 months I think , and yes
[19:06:44] <TsundereNoises> like is this a situation where the same computer will be $300 cheaper in 2 months?
[19:06:56] <MootPoot> the same computer from retail? no
[19:07:02] <TsundereNoises> from buying parts
[19:07:14] <MootPoot> from parts...not really maybe in a year
[19:07:23] <TsundereNoises> okay, so I probably don't care I guess
[19:07:26] <TsundereNoises> don't want to wait that long
[19:07:29] <MootPoot> if anything the newer parts will be more expensive
[19:07:32] <MootPoot> since the supply will be less
[19:07:48] <MootPoot> at most I guess you might save like. 100 or something but thats only off the RAM

[19:08:46] <TsundereNoises> as you have in that build*
[19:08:59] <MootPoot> oh, you want to buy these parts after the new stuff is out?
[19:09:02] <MootPoot> yeah it'll be cheaper
[19:09:07] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: well I'm asking if it's worth it
[19:09:13] <MootPoot> but overall you might save like 100-150 or so I guess
[19:09:15] <adian> amigojapan: my new pc is a asus eeebook
[19:09:18] <TsundereNoises> like I'd rather buy it soon, but if waiting 2 months is significant, I'll wait

[19:10:02] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I mean, I was debating the things you said I could shave money off by changing, and $150 seems significant in comparison
[19:10:05] <MootPoot> so probably cut like the prices on them by 10 or 20% each tops
[19:10:16] <MootPoot> probably more like 8-12%
[19:10:37] <MootPoot> the thing is, this stuff will still be in plenty demand as it is, so its not like the price will crash

[19:12:42] <MootPoot> or irrationally hating any noise coming from your pc
[19:13:26] <MootPoot> since if you have big requirement for electricity efficency or absolutely cannot tolerate any fan noise at all, there will need to be some parts changed again
[19:14:03] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: thanks, so looks like end of october is that Innovation conference thing
[19:14:17] <MootPoot> by big requirement for electrcitiy efficency I mean like if you're using solar only for your house

[19:14:26] <MootPoot> then its chill

[19:14:56] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  the confrence is in october, but it'll take a while after that (maybe a month or so ) for the parts and boards to start hitting the market and be easily available
[19:15:12] <TsundereNoises> like I'm gonna put it under a desk and have headphones on, if it's so loud it THEN gets in the way of hearing music, it would bother me
[19:15:15] <TsundereNoises> but that's a lot of noise
[19:15:25] <MootPoot> are your headphones closed or open bac
[19:15:30] <ButterNoodle> yea go for bigger fans..
[19:15:43] <MootPoot> if open then maybe...if closed then I doubt you'll hear it

[19:16:19] <MootPoot> then its a 50/50, I dont know
[19:16:31] <MootPoot> are they noise cancelling ones?
[19:16:36] <TsundereNoises> no
[19:16:43] <MootPoot> 50/50 it is then
[19:16:44] <TsundereNoises> it's not like I'm allergic to any noise
[19:16:51] <TsundereNoises> but there are definitely computers that are loud enough they annoy me
[19:16:53] <MootPoot> you'll probably be able to hear it if you just have the buds in
[19:17:03] <MootPoot> but if anything is playing it should cover it up
[19:17:09] <TsundereNoises> oh yeah, I meant with music on
[19:17:30] <TsundereNoises> or like, if I put in a speaker, are the fans drowning out what I'm listening to/watching

[19:33:45] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: dont slip on ur seed in the shower.. 70% of all deaths in the home happen in the bathroon
[19:33:46] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises I have only seen a movie
[19:33:54] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: I'm really trying to decide which of their "standard" coffees will be my go-to to compare the special seasonal ones against
[19:34:03] <TsundereNoises> I want to know my default order
[19:34:18] <ButterNoodle> its always nice to have a little blend-b around
[19:34:18] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: oh, I thought for sure you'd seen Sakura too
[19:34:30] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: Blend B is a strong contender!
[19:34:55] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: did you see the movie where they go to hong kong?
[19:35:02] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: we recently finished watching magic Knight rayearth. Which is another clamp show

[19:43:11] <TsundereNoises> no
[19:43:31] <TsundereNoises> you have to copy something pretty damn closely for it to actually be copyright infringement
[19:45:33] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises:  lol if that's half your goal I can redo a build for you that does it in like 400 dollars new
[19:45:52] <MootPoot> the only reason why the price is so high is becasue you gave me a budget that high
[19:45:54] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I'm semi-joking, that IS a problem I face, but I want more than that
[19:46:21] <TsundereNoises> I'm more just joking about the current state of things
[19:46:45] <MootPoot> a 400 dollar modern build would also probably solve that and video editing problem for you, but then you'd have to upgrade in like 2-3 years 
[19:46:55] <MootPoot> by upgrade I mean add more parts, not new computer
[19:47:44] <TsundereNoises> is the middle ground pointless?
[19:47:59] <MootPoot> not really, it just depends on what you want

[19:54:05] <KatrinValerie> it's a joke, I was attempting to make a joke about clothing items at first but I couldn't remember names of clothing items and didn't get a nice punchline together so I came up with this one on the fly

[20:07:06] <Sadale> well, I mean if someone talks about suicide, censoring it isn't a solution. Instead we should try to be supportive to whoever talking about that.
[20:07:33] <Sadale> so that the idea would (hopefully?) go away
[20:07:40] <KatrinValerie> Sadale: the issue is that it prompts suicidal ideation in others who might be vurnerable to it.

[20:23:39] <Sadale> MootPoot, If you just want the work experience so that you'd get hired in your home country, 6 month's probably too short. I dunno. Maybe a couple of years would do?
[20:23:59] <ButterNoodle> is hong kong china?
[20:24:05] <Jigsy> Oh, Hong Kong?
[20:24:09] <Jigsy> I just saw "China."

[20:24:19] <MootPoot> it entirely depends on how I like it there
[20:24:20] <Sadale> MootPoot, did you mean you would or you wouldn't want to leave Canada permanently?
[20:24:23] <Cryowolf> same with Taiwan
[20:24:29] <MootPoot> Sadale:  wouldnt
[20:24:35] <Cryowolf> they don't consider themselves a part of China

[20:24:40] <MootPoot> my home base will probably alwasy be canada
[20:24:45] <Sadale> Cryowolf, I'm so-called Hongkonger. And Hong Kong is a part of China.
[20:24:52] <ButterNoodle> the girls are cuter in hong kong
[20:24:55] <Jigsy> China probably considers the entire planet part of China.
[20:24:59] <MootPoot> I'd be okay with just checkin gout a few countries for a while tho
[20:25:02] <Sadale> Cryowolf, some people around me may not agree tho. But personally I do agree.
[20:25:10] <Cryowolf> Sadale, then you are obviously not included in most
[20:25:11] <TsundereNoises> China has a lot more direct control over hong kong than taiwan though

[20:28:33] <Sadale> I think the new laws imposed here would have a limit. They just want to stop the riots. And it's quite effective. They don't want to damage the economy.
[20:28:37] <MootPoot> Sadale:  how much do I need to make to like live in HK
[20:28:47] <MootPoot> montly
[20:28:48] <Sadale> And the riots were quite damaging to the economy here tbh.
[20:28:56] <ButterNoodle> alot
[20:29:01] <ButterNoodle> ?
[20:29:09] <ButterNoodle> where is ImoutoBot's spell checker
[20:29:11] <MootPoot> I'd prefer it if I didnt have to like bunk bed with someone
[20:29:23] <ButterNoodle> I'd bunk
[20:29:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, depends on how you plan to live. :P
[20:29:34] <MootPoot> single bedrrom studio would be enough
[20:29:38] <Sadale> MootPoot, I actually have drafted a budget a while ago.
[20:29:39] <TsundereNoises> in a bunk bed, but he gets both bunks to himself
[20:29:40] <ButterNoodle> the problem is deciding do I want top or bottom w cute girl?
[20:30:08] <MootPoot> I just want it to be air conditioned, have ok/good internet, and maybe a small stove
[20:30:15] <MootPoot> I can just sleeping bad and mat the floor
[20:30:36] <MootPoot> but being alone is mandatory
[20:30:38] <MootPoot> no sharing
[20:30:39] <Sadale> MootPoot, apartment rent: HK$10000 (lower if you're renting partitioned apartment. Even lower if you're sharing toilet and kitchen and stuffs). Meal (assuming HK$50 per meal, 3 meals a day): HK$4500. Utilities (electricity: HK$1000, water: HK$100, gas: HK$300, internet: HK$300): HK$1700. Commute (assuming HK$15 per trip, two trips a day for 30 days): HK$900.
[20:30:45] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot becomes MatPoot
[20:30:54] <Cryowolf> Sadale, that damage is very temporary while China putting heavy restrictions is very long term and would ruin a lot of the Chinese market. I mean companies are already opening new factories in other countries than China
[20:31:02] <Cryowolf> and those countries are more than happy to welcome them
[20:31:12] <MootPoot> Sadale:  but how much will I be making tho
[20:31:21] <Sadale> Cryowolf, I mean China is not dumb. It knows what it's doing.
[20:31:26] <Sadale> MootPoot, depends xD
[20:31:41] <MootPoot> whats the least you expect me to make
[20:31:59] <ButterNoodle> how much candy can u fit in ur mouth MootPoot?
[20:32:04] <Cryowolf> Sadale, do they? They'd throw you in jail for showing a picture of Winnie the Pooh with the Chinese flag
[20:32:04] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'd quote for at minimum 18k HKD if you've got a degree. But the salary range of tech sector is huge here.
[20:32:07] <MootPoot> 1
[20:32:14] <MootPoot> 18k monthly?
[20:32:17] <Sadale> MootPoot, yep.
[20:32:38] <Sadale> Cryowolf, I mean you'd get jailed by showing nazi flag in Germany as well
[20:32:42] <MootPoot> so adding up your thing it seems like the baseline I need to make is 16k hkd
[20:32:56] <Cryowolf> Sadale, whataboutism doesnt make it better
[20:33:15] <Sadale> You just play along with the rules. The rules are there. So don't break them. You know that the rules is not to talk shit about the government. And you're talking shit about the government. What are you expecting?
[20:33:16] <MootPoot> well, I think you can show the nazi flag in germany but it has to be academic and like throughly explaining the thing
[20:33:21] <MootPoot> not sure
[20:34:11] <MootPoot> Sadale:  what about moderate
[20:34:23] <MootPoot> middle of the road salary
[20:34:31] <MootPoot> 30k HKD?
[20:34:33] <Sadale> Each place has different rules. In Germany, don't show nazi flag. In the US, don't use the n-word. In China, don't get involved in political activism.
[20:34:51] <Sadale> MootPoot, hmm. What did you mean by middle of the road?
[20:35:06] <MootPoot> to be perfectly honest out of all of those examples dont get involed in activism is the harshest by far
[20:35:18] <MootPoot> its not a perfectly fair "this rule here this rule there"
[20:35:23] <MootPoot> Sadale:  average salary
[20:35:35] <Cryowolf> Sadale, what you're describing and licking the boot of is an authoritarian dictatorship. "Follow the rules", uhuh. What if the rules one day demanded you must obey a soldiers command as if its absolute and he tells you to kill your family to prove your loyalty?
[20:35:51] <Cryowolf> an extreme examples but its not like this hasnt happened during Mao
[20:36:12] <MootPoot> also, to be perfectly honest, Cryowolf  the same happens in democracies like the US and the UK as well
[20:36:27] <MootPoot> there are plenty of "just follow the rules" here as well
[20:36:28] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, they ask you to shoot your family?
[20:37:06] <MootPoot> As I undertand it you're both arguing the stuff that happens right now
[20:37:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, Anyway, I've seen 15k-60k. For first job tho, if you're a local here, I'd say you'd likely get 18k-25k.
[20:37:10] <Cryowolf> there are laws and some laws are reasonable, some aren't. I would say most Swedish laws are reasonable while a few aren't
[20:37:16] <ButterNoodle> I think the words are "blind obedience"
[20:37:17] <MootPoot> picking extreme examples from history is a bit eh
[20:37:36] <MootPoot> lets just limit it to the last few years
[20:37:40] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, no it's not, not as a response to "just follow the rules"
[20:37:47] <ButterNoodle> following the rules is a little light.. we all like a bit of law and order to keep the crazies under control
[20:38:14] <MootPoot> Cryowolf:  if you want to go down that path, the democracies did "follow the rules" for stuff like slavery
[20:38:15] <ButterNoodle> *whilst maintaining personal liberties and freedoms
[20:38:28] <Cryowolf> yes they did, then they abolished it
[20:38:35] <MootPoot> Sadale:  that's livable
[20:39:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, but you'd be an expat here. I've no clue on the pay for expat. I'm not sure if you'd get paid more or less.
[20:39:09] <Cryowolf> China heading down the same path it has before is what's troubling
[20:39:10] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: which took a immense amount of sacrifice and pain to do, its not like they just decided just fine
[20:39:20] <MootPoot> we're not gonna slave anymore
[20:39:33] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: lets not make this a financial discussion
[20:39:41] <Cryowolf> having their own concentration camps, oh I'm sorry I mean re-education centres
[20:39:42] <Sadale> wage slavery xD
[20:39:44] <MootPoot> lol
[20:39:50] <MootPoot> I guess we're all still slaves
[20:40:00] * MootPoot goes back to ButterNoodle's basement and awaits dinner
[20:40:00] <Sadale> walmart and amazon workers
[20:40:01] <ButterNoodle> I got my free dom
[20:40:23] <MootPoot> Sadale:  anyway, that seems livable I guess
[20:40:28] <ButterNoodle> they are compensated Sadale
[20:40:32] <ButterNoodle> not very well
[20:40:32] <Sadale> MootPoot, yep. It's livable.
[20:40:33] <MootPoot> do you know if HK has any sort of bias against hiring forigners
[20:40:34] <ButterNoodle> but they are
[20:40:40] <MootPoot> for normie jobs
[20:41:00] <MootPoot> I know most places in the world are okay with forigners for specific jobs but like japan have a stick up their ass for anything else
[20:41:04] <Cryowolf> There is no comparing what China is doing now to Western democracy, though there's some troubling things going on with covid laws being made permament. That still doesn't come a nywhere close though
[20:41:21] <Sadale> MootPoot, depends. I suspect that most companies prefer locals tho. Because it's a hassle to apply for the work visa. And foreigners may not be familiar with local culture
[20:41:50] <MootPoot> will I have to go to after work parties and get smashed drunk every night
[20:41:51] <MootPoot> I dont drink
[20:41:52] <MootPoot> lmao
[20:41:58] <Sadale> China's doing well in getting covid under control.
[20:42:07] <Cryowolf> lol
[20:42:14] <MootPoot> Sadale:  but that being said, are any companies open to hiring me remotely from here?
[20:42:21] <MootPoot> No visa required
[20:42:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, remotely? probably not.
[20:42:35] <MootPoot> most companies here are changing to permanant remote
[20:42:38] <Sadale> MootPoot, I mean you could try applying.
[20:42:41] <Cryowolf> I don't trust a word of that but it is true that a dictatorship has an easier time dealing with a pandemic. Cause they can just shoot anyone not complying

[20:44:08] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, name one thting they are doing better
[20:44:15] <Sadale> As for covid tho, China is indeed doing well. We've got a huge capacity on doing covid test. With the case number being low enough, whenever there's a few cases, the entire city would get locked down and all people inside would get tested.
[20:44:38] <MootPoot> Cryowolf:  infrastrucre development , handling of covid, and renewables
[20:44:45] <Sadale> Western people may not like it. But it's very efficient.
[20:44:50] <HeTo> Cryowolf: actually it doesn't. a dictatorship has serious issues in not knowing even itself how bad the situation is, because on every level the person in charge has an incentive to mangle the numbers, and there's nothing to hold them accountable until the situation gets so bad it just can't be hidden any more
[20:44:54] <MootPoot> and forign policy with other countries 
[20:44:57] <Cryowolf> renewables? It's most polluted country in the world
[20:45:04] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: overall I like the Los Volcanes better by a fair margin, it's kind of richer, more complex, a bit less sour
[20:45:08] <MootPoot> Cryowolf:  source
[20:45:32] <MootPoot> I'm like 99% sure some random place in africa or south america will be worse
[20:45:41] <Cryowolf> infrastructure development? A lot of it is built and then left there to just fall apart, or built with inferior material that's dangerous
[20:45:46] <Sadale> As for fabricating data tho, I think those capitalistic corporates would do the same.
[20:45:53] <Cryowolf> to cheat and get more money over
[20:45:56] <HeTo> MootPoot: China is building a lot of coal power
[20:46:09] <MootPoot> Cryowolf:  by infrastructure I mean like public infastrcutre, not random housing bubble apartments
[20:46:15] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, source would be any map that measures pollution in the atmosphere
[20:46:17] <Sadale> Cryowolf, take a look at the high speed rail network of China. It's far better than the US. It's faster, more extensive and it has high ridership

[20:46:56] <Sadale> Cryowolf, For the ridership it isn't really a fair comparison tho. That's because China has more population.
[20:47:14] <MootPoot> with 24% being renewable overall
[20:47:19] <Cryowolf> Sadale, so? This is something Japan has as well and something I personally think more countries should invest in. But a train isn't what I meant
[20:47:31] <MootPoot> HeTo:  they are, but they are also doing much more renewables then most western nations
[20:47:42] <Sadale> Yes. But China now has the largest high speed rail network in the world
[20:48:12] <Cryowolf> and that means nothing to me in a dictatorship
[20:48:27] <MootPoot> Cryowolf:  it would be nice if you stopped changing the goalposts

[20:50:19] <MootPoot> so you're admitting to not actually being interested in discusttion, but you just want to unidirectionally shit on china
[20:50:19] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, I do want to shit on the Chinese Government yes. Not the Chinese people

[20:51:48] <TsundereNoises> hey, if you're the guy in charge, the taliban system has merits, just not for anyone else
[20:51:57] <Sadale> What I don't like is that you make it sounds like that the non-western ones are just shit. I mean you're not the people there. Even if you don't like it, as long as the system isn't imposed to you, it's none of your business
[20:52:24] <Sadale> And I'm sure that there're civilian who supports Taliban there.
[20:52:36] <Cryowolf> non-western? I've never mentioned any other country than China and now the Taliban
[20:52:40] <TsundereNoises> I think it's everyone's business when a country is killing lots of innocent people
[20:52:43] <Sadale> Yes, some people are leaving because they don't like it. But some will stay.
[20:52:45] <Cryowolf> the Taliban aren't a country anyway
[20:52:47] <TsundereNoises> those people don't choose that, even if the citizens do
[20:52:52] <TsundereNoises> i.e. Tibet
[20:53:15] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: they're the government of Afghanistan at this point
[20:53:22] <TsundereNoises> in reality
[20:53:29] <Sadale> yeah hundreds of years ago those western colonists killed a lot of innocent citizens all over the world as well.
[20:53:33] <Cryowolf> so, like South Park did...I will say. Fuck the Chinese Government

[20:55:12] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, it could be worse
[20:55:15] <ButterNoodle> its does...
[20:55:18] <ButterNoodle> as a whole
[20:55:18] <TsundereNoises> it could also stand to be a hell of a lot better though
[20:55:19] <ButterNoodle> or hole
[20:55:28] <ButterNoodle> but its there
[20:55:49] <TsundereNoises> but that's the thing, I have tons of things I criticize about us, but doesn't mean setting up a dictatorship is better
[20:56:12] <ButterNoodle> our gubberment spends 100s of billions of taxpayer dollars for over inflated healthcare costs for the elderly and poor
[20:56:23] <Sadale> Each system is just different tho. Each has their own problems and merits.
[20:56:25] <ButterNoodle> and true
[20:56:31] <TsundereNoises> we should invest some serious fucking money in transportation infastructure, for example
[20:56:40] <ButterNoodle> that would be nice

[20:57:50] <ButterNoodle> we arent*
[20:58:10] <TsundereNoises> that's the thing, I talk a lot about how much we suck, but that's because I want us to do better
[20:58:13] <TsundereNoises> and plenty of people do worse
[20:58:23] <TsundereNoises> and frankly because a lot of our problems are self-inflicted
[20:58:45] <Sadale> sadly just because one could talk about something suck doesn't mean that the problem would get fixed

[21:00:06] <TsundereNoises> I mean I really don't think there's anything wrong with communism in the abstract, none of my problems with China are because of communism itself
[21:00:09] <Cryowolf> you have to save face, often by shifting blame or whataboutisming

[21:02:43] <Cryowolf> often problems in dictatorships concerned with face aren't solved because admitting to problems would mean you lose face. In democracies it's because there's so many sides and elected that each have their agendas that they were elected for as well as personal ones that it takes forever before agreements can be reached
[21:03:03] <Cryowolf> each is annoying, and pointless
[21:03:09] <TsundereNoises> I do feel like the only people that actually excuse things like US treatment of native americans, for example, are people arguing that their own atrocities aren't so bad

[21:07:09] <adian> The US discriminatory history isn't very far back but people like
[21:07:09] <adian> 	   to pretend it is
[21:07:20] <Cryowolf> yeah
[21:07:24] <adian> what do u mean
[21:07:58] <Cryowolf> iot wasn't until the 60s and 70s that your civil rights movement gave black people(and other non-white) and women equal rights to the rest
[21:08:13] <Cryowolf> it wasnt until 2000s that gay people were legally allowed to get married
[21:08:28] <adian> ok i see
[21:08:29] <adian> thx
[21:08:39] <Cryowolf> that's what I mean, it's not very far back at all. It's very recent
[21:08:51] <adian> yeah i see
[21:09:04] <adian> i mean the computer made that change 
[21:09:14] <adian> cuz ppl too busy with internet they see they not so good afterall
[21:09:24] <adian> so ppl think that they are weaker than they would think in tribalspeak
[21:09:37] <Cryowolf> the hell
[21:09:39] <adian> haha
[21:09:49] <adian> cuz of computer and internet we fight less
[21:10:13] <adian> it's a psychedelic
[21:10:19] <adian> it gets u hooked for life
[21:10:38] <adian> ifywim
[21:10:44] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: to be fair, a lot of that discrimination was technically illegal and just not enforced, or was created through social pressures that needed enforcement to correct rather than being pushed on the population from the top down
[21:10:46] <adian> iykwim
[21:10:48] <TsundereNoises> doesn't make it BETTER
[21:10:51] <Cryowolf> Now I'm gonna go watch Japanese propaganda...GATE! Half-joking, it's not propaganda it's not any different than what American movies orseries do when they show how great the US army is
[21:10:53] <TsundereNoises> but it's not the same situation really
[21:11:22] <adian> haha
[21:11:26] <adian> so fun !!! I MEAN THAT
[21:11:29] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: I only like depressing war movies
[21:11:30] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, people of different color couldnt get married and if they were found to be living together as a couple they could be split up  
[21:11:32] <adian> ur clever
[21:11:41] <Cryowolf> and so on
[21:12:24] <Cryowolf> anyway, my main point was that things are being done to improve
[21:12:43] <Cryowolf> to make society a place of equal opportunity and rights
[21:12:45] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: yes, and that was overturned by a supreme court ruling, the part of the constitution it violated was from 1868, but it took that long for people to actually be able to have a legal challenge
[21:12:51] <TsundereNoises> it IS a different situation
[21:13:41] <Cryowolf> but it's all recent and so often made to feel like it's 100s of years ago
[21:13:52] <Cryowolf> was my point
[21:14:00] <Cryowolf> as well
[21:14:13] <Cryowolf> I mean I made several points, but that wasnt my main point
[21:14:15] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: I don't think anyone treats that like it was 100s of years ago?
[21:14:28] <Cryowolf> my main point was and still is that things are improving
[21:14:33] <Cryowolf> and that's good

[21:14:57] <TsundereNoises> but my point is just that that wasn't actually something passed down from on high, some states enforced technically illegal laws limitting interracial marriage and no one bothered to challenge them for a long time because it was just accepted in those states and there were lots of other discriminatory issues
[21:15:32] <TsundereNoises> I mean there was a very real and deliberate push to basically be as terrible as possible in large swathes of the country
[21:15:51] <TsundereNoises> hell, we're doing that today with voting rights
[21:16:08] <TsundereNoises> trying to make it as tough to vote as possible where that's politically convenient

[21:16:33] <TsundereNoises> but I'd argue that's inherently a different situation because it's not Biden (or Trump) enforcing that, it's at a local level and needs to be shut down from the top, not vice versa
[21:16:40] <TsundereNoises> it still sucks, but I think that's a big difference
