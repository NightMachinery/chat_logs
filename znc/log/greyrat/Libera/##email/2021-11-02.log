[15:18:01] <greyrat> My outgoing email setup suddenly broke. I am using an unencrypted mail2 docker server. Here is mutt's logs: https://paste.gnugen.ch/paste/jytp
[15:18:49] <greyrat> I guess I should somehow force mutt not to use =starttls=, but using `ssl_starttls= mutt` did not work. 
[15:19:37] <greyrat> `ssl_force_tls= ssl_starttls= mutt` did not work either.
[15:20:41] <Khepra> "did not work"
[15:20:46] <Khepra> are your certs valid?
[15:24:42] <greyrat> khepra: I do not want to use TLS at all, and naturally my certs are invalid.
[15:30:59] <Khepra> greyrat: did you try setting those to "no" in .muttrc?  I'm not sure that command line invocation does what you think it does
[15:31:30] <Khepra> also what URL are you using for smtp_url ?
[15:31:46] <Khepra> what _scheme_ in the URL, I mean
