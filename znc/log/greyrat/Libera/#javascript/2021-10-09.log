[01:12:02] <sheetjs> the tooling itself changes and breaks backwards compatibility
[01:12:05] <ljharb> in what way?
[01:12:17] <ljharb> pnpm has major versions too, fwiw
[01:12:25] <ljharb> the presence of breaking changes isn't an inherent problem
[01:12:39] <ljharb> (also, pnpm's approach breaks things in the ecosystem, so it's a much less wise choice than npm, full stop)
[01:13:34] *** Quits: vdamewood (~vdamewood@fedora/vdamewood) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[01:14:19] <ljharb> so yes, npm has had 7 rounds of breaking changes (altho 7 → 8 is just dropping node 10, nothing else), but they're actually super good about back compat
[01:14:24] <sheetjs> major version breakage aside, https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/15855 was a minor update that broke old versions of node to add nagware
[01:14:52] <ljharb> yes, and that annoyed me too, but using npm 4 on node 0.12 was already unsupported
[01:15:15] <ljharb> the npm cli definitely doesn't have a good track record of using `engines`, for sure
[01:15:32] <Alexendoo> ljharb: It's just a pain to wait for some other deps to release a new version with just a package.json bump before you can upgrade some other package
[01:15:37] <ljharb> which is why i made `nvm install-latest-npm` - but if you use that (or at least, the same npm version it installs for any arbitrary node version) you're always fine
[01:15:37] <sheetjs> yesterday a customer had an issue that stemmed from `npm install` not honoring scopes.  old school tarball downloads miraculously worked
[01:15:50] <ljharb> Alexendoo: that's always what you have to do tho.
[01:16:04] <ljharb> Alexendoo: you can use `NPM_CONFIG_LEGACY_PEER_DEPS=true` if you want to keep the unsafe behavior from before
[01:16:18] <ljharb> sheetjs: the only one i know of with that is because gitlab's registry endpoints are broken
[01:16:22] <ljharb> sheetjs: was it with gitlab?
[01:16:46] <sheetjs> no it was verdaccio and it "just works" for most of our customers
[01:16:58] <ljharb> very strange, to be sure. link me to the cli issue?

[02:36:14] <pavonia> I actually don't understand why function hoisting is considered bad by many. The top should have the more important/high-level functions, then the utility functions can follow below. To me that increases readability
[02:36:56] <ljharb> pavonia: because you shouldn't be reading the callsite until you've read the definition
[02:37:11] <ljharb> pavonia: if they're not important enough to read first, they don't belong in the same file. put them in different modules, and import them at the top.
[02:37:41] <KDev> I don't remember the exact words, but someone told me that arrow functions should be used when I don't need to use "this", or bind something to "this", some other nitty gritty details. They said it leaves less assumptions for the reader
[02:38:54] <ljharb> KDev: nah, i don't agree
[02:39:20] <ljharb> KDev: normal functions should be the default; using an arrow signals to me that you are USING `this`, and that you care a lot about it being the lexical one instead of a runtime-defined one.

[04:23:29] <ezzieyguywuf> since the request library is deprecated, is there another "modern" way to make https requests in node (i.e. using the promise/await api)? or is http.request(...) with callbacks still the way to do it?

[07:45:19] <ljharb> ezzieyguywuf: the only reason to use an arrow function is for an inline callback, or if you need `this` to be the lexical this instead of a runtime-determined value

[14:12:53] <silly_> there error is somewhere else
[14:12:57] <silly_> another file
[14:13:04] <teut> it could be

[14:13:15] <teut> nowhere else
[14:13:15] <silly_> you should set up your webpack sourcemap
[14:13:48] <teut> I ll need to read it

[14:14:11] <silly_> can you paste the TeamCard file?
[14:14:38] <silly_> and your webpack config
[14:14:39] <teut> https://dpaste.org/jYRY
[14:14:55] <teut> where is that in cra?
[14:17:15] <silly_> oh :( dunno cra
[14:17:19] <silly_> never used it
[14:17:58] <silly_> oh, there's icons.map... with no key prop
[14:17:59] <teut> then how do you use react?
[14:18:05] <teut> let me check
[14:18:11] <silly_> line 89 in teamcard
[14:18:33] <teut> thanks
[14:18:40] <silly_> npm i react and stuff
[14:18:41] <teut> this might be the issue then
[14:18:48] <silly_> add files and webpack
[14:18:53] <silly_> no cra needed
[14:19:05] <teut> hmm, I got learn that, I have just used webpack once to use react with django
[14:19:12] <teut> was quite difficult
[14:19:32] <silly_> you definitely want sourcemaps configured with webpack-dev-server
[14:19:37] <silly_> unlike it is now
[14:19:49] <teut> are you sure we dont get it with cra/
[14:19:52] <teut> ?
[14:20:01] <teut> the sourcemap thing
[14:20:06] <silly_> there has to be a way
[14:20:32] <silly_> but bbl
[14:20:41] <silly_> got to go to the kitchen
[14:20:53] <silly_> try google
[14:21:03] <silly_> cra webpack sourcemap

[15:04:20] <teut> can some tell again?

[15:15:14] <epolanski> in the second example you are returning a function again {()=> setState()}
[15:15:51] <epolanski> also notice that {()=> setState()} and {setState} are equivalent

[15:17:31] <teut> nice thing,   so    {setState} can also be used?
[15:17:46] <epolanski> ok, that's assuming that there aren't magical arguments passed in
[15:18:04] <epolanski> if the onClick is passing an event, which is probably the case
[15:18:17] <epolanski> and `setState` is using it, then no, they aren't
[15:18:17] <teut> ok now , it looks obvious to me
[15:18:33] <teut> first argument should be the "event"
[15:19:00] <teut> so it would be dangerous to replace state with event

[15:19:16] <epolanski> yes, what I was trying to say is that if your callback looks like event => setState(event) then they are equivalent
[15:19:20] <silly_> it'll probably be this.setState, then this might be off, with classes you could do this.setState.bind(this), i'm not sure with function components what could be done, better use ()=>this.setState because lexical this thing
[15:19:30] <epolanski> but if setState does not use the argument, then they are the same
[15:19:53] <silly_> oh wait, with useState there's no this.setState :p
[15:20:51] <silly_> and... you didn't use classes, all in hooks in your code

[23:38:14] <systemfault> Hmm, that would look weird... something like log`${'background: red;'}Hello ${'color: green'}world`; Hmm... not sure it's good.
[23:38:26] <cthulchu_> huh. Well. No, I'm satisfied with what log provides, hehe. Look at how cool it looks: https://i.imgur.com/KfWTADj.png The only thing is... Can I easily detect whether the client uses light or dark console?
[23:41:21] <systemfault> cthulchu_: If the console respects the new light/more css apis... then probably using something like https://usefulangle.com/post/318/javascript-check-dark-mode-activated
[23:41:29] <cthulchu_> looks like I can. If I inspect the document... of the devtools. How do I get to the devtools document from... well, from window scope?
