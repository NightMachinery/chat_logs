[00:41:53] <ratagin> Hey, good afternoon Perl mongers!  Are there any Perl Dancer users on here?  I used CGI.pm but not able to wrap my brain around Dancer.
[00:42:31] <Grinnz> i know a lot more about mojolicious, but ask if you have a question and we will help if we can
[00:42:39] <Grinnz> perlbot: ask to ask
[00:42:40] <perlbot> Grinnz: Don't ask to ask or ask if there are any users of X around, people often don't respond to that because they've used X but maybe not the same features as you. Instead, skip straight to your question + pastebot link and if somebody knows they'll probably try to help
[00:42:52] <ratagin> I have a program that returns a value.  I want to print it in Dancer,
[00:42:54] <mst> ratagin: if you're confused using Dancer2, the key thing is to think about what URLs you want
[00:42:56] <ratagin> :D
[00:43:06] <Grinnz> "print it"?
[00:43:11] <ratagin> Yeah, might try mojolicious
[00:43:15] <mst> once you're in a URL handler, you have the request information in request()
[00:43:36] <ratagin> use Dancer2;
[00:43:39] <Grinnz> dancer2 and mojolicious and any modern (non-CGI) framework doesn't work via printing to STDOUT
[00:43:44] <ratagin> and then ... 
[00:43:53] <Grinnz> if you want to send a response, you use the functions for doing that
[00:44:02] <ratagin> require "/root/public/mkPass/RandomPass.pl";
[00:44:15] <Grinnz> that's also a perl 4 method of including code :P
[00:44:19] <ratagin> then I call a couple of subroutines...  
[00:44:24] <ratagin> I know.  :P
[00:44:27] <ratagin> it was easy
[00:44:31] <ratagin> (I thought)
[00:44:32] <Grinnz> but props for using an absolute path, that at least avoids some vulnerabilities
[00:44:47] <mst> ratagin: that's not an external program :P
[00:45:03] <ratagin> &stuffwords;
[00:45:11] <mst> that's perl4
[00:45:19] <mst> stuffwords() is how to call a subroutine
[00:45:21] *** Quits: kylese (~kylese@p5dd8b9a8.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:45:40] <mst> I think you may have learned CGI.pm from a tutorial written by somebody who didn't know perl :(
[00:45:40] <Grinnz> and you probably want to pass args to the subroutine and receive a return value you can do something with
[00:46:03] <ratagin> yes, it's external.  Then I run stuffwords() which put all 10 letters words into a an array called @ten
[00:46:16] <mst> that's not external
[00:46:36] <ratagin> 9 letter words into @nine and so on.  Then I stick them together with a random number for password.  
[00:46:53] <ratagin> Kinda wanted it on the web so I don't have to access from PC.  :D
[00:47:07] <Grinnz> caring about the names of variables means it is probably using package variables and you aren'tt using strict or warnings, which fits with the perl 4 code you've shown so far
[00:47:16] <Grinnz> maybe start with a perl 5 tutorial :)
[00:47:17] <ratagin> Yeah, I was slow to embrace Perl 5 - didn't start until about 2001.... :D
[00:47:19] <Grinnz> perlbot: quickstart
[00:47:19] <perlbot> Grinnz: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/perl/ -> http://mvp.kablamo.org/ -> https://qntm.org/files/perl/perl.html -> http://www.modernperlbooks.com/
[00:47:58] <Grinnz> the problem with almost all of these outdated practices is it will make it more difficult for you to use the code in a flexible way, which you will need to do
[00:48:16] *** Joins: jabberwok (~wlindley@75.105.20.104)
[00:48:20] <ratagin> oh, I suppose I could clean it all up just wondering if you can pass Dancer a value - haven't seen it in cookbook
[00:48:23] <Grinnz> you're usiing it as a library function, but it's depending on several assumptions about the code outside it
[00:48:35] <Grinnz> library functions should instead take values in and return values, and not depend on global state
[00:48:41] <mst> ratagin: you've not shown me anything involving a value yet though :(
[00:48:43] <ratagin> yes, it is very different for me
[00:48:59] <Grinnz> "pass Dancer a value" doesn't really mean anything, again you'll have to be more specific
[00:49:10] <ratagin> mst - probably never will - just playing around on a Friday afternoon
[00:49:12] <Grinnz> you can pass Dancer values for lots of reasons
[00:49:16] <mst> my $value = something_returning_a_value();
[00:49:29] <mst> response->content_type('text/plain');
[00:49:37] <mst> response->encode_content($value);
[00:49:42] <mst> is what the Dancer2 docs tell you to do
[00:50:15] <ratagin> that looks to be right on the money!
[00:51:07] <mst> you wanted to send a string as a response
[00:51:19] <mst> so I checked the docs for the response: https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2::Core::Response

[02:50:48] <vanfanel64> Is it possible in a script (started as root, as I want to run it from a system event handler) to change what user it is running as, then set up certain environment variables, like DISPLAY=:0, DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=... and such, then running a command (using system function or similar) ?
[02:51:34] <vanfanel64> The main thing I cannot figure out is how to set env variable before running a command in the script.'
[02:53:43] <vanfanel64> What I am trying to do with in response to a system event, I want to start a program on my desktop. I can do it with su myuser -c '/path/to/program' in a bash script, after exporting the needed variables, and the program starts on my desktop. But I want to replace this with a perl script.
[02:55:15] <vanfanel64> The script that is triggered by the event lives in /etc/acpi and instead of using su I want to run a perl script to start the program as well as to various other checks and stuff.
[02:57:05] <vanfanel64> So two things I cannot find, how to correctly change what user the script is running as [something I remember seeing in discussions in the past, but which I cannot find], and how to set up the environment from within the script. Once I have those two things resolved, I can just run system, I think

[03:04:19] <Grinnz> for the first part, to correctly change user you need to do this https://metacpan.org/dist/Mojolicious-Plugin-SetUserGroup/source/lib/Mojolicious/Plugin/SetUserGroup.pm#L60-66
[03:04:19] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ lib/Mojolicious/Plugin/SetUserGroup.pm - metacpan.org ]
[03:04:43] <Grinnz> you need to set the gid *and* initgroups (initgroups is unfortunately not available in POSIX.pm, hence the Unix::Groups::FFI usage there)
[03:04:55] <Grinnz> and then you need to set the uid last, because once you do that you can't change any more
[03:05:39] <Grinnz> skipping any of those steps risks leaving root permissions intact, or not getting the group permissions something will need
[03:06:11] <vanfanel64> OH, it was setgid that I was trying to remember
[03:06:21] <Grinnz> this is obviously unix specific, but it sounds like you're already pretty unix specific in this task
[03:06:38] <vanfanel64> Yes I am doing this on a linux machine
[03:07:11] <vanfanel64> windows can suck it, so many things that you cannot script there without writing a dang driver
[03:07:37] <Grinnz> for teh second part, you either include the env in the command by running it via a shell or /usr/bin/env; or you export the vars before the command

[03:10:34] <vanfanel64> sudo: initgroups: command not found
[03:10:34] <Grinnz> initgroups is for setting the secondary groups, otherwise you will still have root's secondary groups rather than the target user's
[03:10:40] <Kobaz> I think i was given a project and they said "here, fix this, it's perl"

[03:14:33] <vanfanel64> I do not mind installing Unix::Groups::FFI
[03:15:40] <Grinnz> either initgroups or setgroups is necessary
[03:16:06] <Grinnz> POSIX.pm doesn't provide setgroups either unfortunately, even though setting $) does it in a weird roundabout way
[03:16:20] <Grinnz> setgroups means you have to find the secondary groups yourself

[03:21:24] <Grinnz> note most of the weird error handling is because it has to rethrow the errors to be useful - in normal usage, you can just let initgroups throw an exception and check the setuid/setgid return values

[17:42:54] <jabberwok> If I were part of p5p I would comment on that thread that Emacs OrgMode format has many of the desired features like tables altho its formatting of e.g., headers, differs from markdown. 
[17:42:56] <jabberwok> I am working on a so-far decades-long research project (on Phœnix Arizona streetcars) and using a mix of *.org and *.markdown files, I could impedance-match Org::Parser into an sdview parser if that would be valuable to anyone else.

[20:04:52] <new_guest_21> Hi, since I am more comfortable with PCRE regex, I'm using `perl` command to parse piped output and get the matched groups I need. Here's what I am trying looks like:
[20:04:52] <new_guest_21> `transmission-show a.torrent | perl -ne '/^GENERAL[\s]*Name: (.*)[\s]*Hash: (.*)$/ && print "$1";'`
[20:04:53] <new_guest_21> Here's what the output of `transmission-show a.torrent` looks like: https://l.perl.bot/raw/fey6c8
[20:04:53] <new_guest_21> It's not my regex, because I checked it on https://regex101.com/ and https://www.regextester.com/
[20:04:54] <new_guest_21> I'm thinking it has to do with the `perl` command's flags (tried `-p`, `-0777`, etc.) or the regex flags (I tried `/s`, `/m`, `/g`), but nothing seems to work right.
[20:04:54] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ regex101: build, test, and debug regex ] [ Regex Tester and Debugger Online - Javascript, PCRE, PHP ]
[20:04:54] <new_guest_21> I'd really appreciate any help!
[20:11:35] <fizzie> With plain `-ne`, the given code is executed in a loop that processes one line at a time, no matter what you do with your regex. So you'll definitely need the -0777 in it to make the record separator not match anything.
[20:13:22] <xenu> yeah
[20:13:59] <fizzie> This would seem to work for me: perl -0777 -ne '/^GENERAL[\s]*Name: (.*?)[\s]*Hash: (.*)$/ms && print "$1\n";' < tmp.txt
[20:14:26] <fizzie> Or just with /s if you forget about those ^$s in it.
[20:14:28] <xenu> there's one more problem with that regex - when the 'm' modifier isn't present, $ means 'end of the string', not 'end of the line'
[20:15:19] <fizzie> I also added a ? to the ...Name: (.*?)[\s]*Hash... bit, because doing ...Name: (.*?)[\s]*Hash... will capture all the whitespace as well.

[20:25:00] <new_guest_21> Almost there, thank you fizzie
[20:25:31] <new_guest_21> Unable to get $2 to match and print what I want. Trying other suggestions
[20:25:42] <aquanight> maybe try: | perl -ne '(/^GENERAL/ .. /^TRACKERS/) and /(Name|Hash): / and print ${^POSTMATCH}'
[20:27:48] <new_guest_21> Tried it, prints nothing. I assume you mean I need to take the idea and implement it right, but that very high-level (that I've never used before)
[20:27:57] <new_guest_21> but that seems*
[20:29:06] <new_guest_21> This does what I want...
[20:29:08] <new_guest_21> `transmission-show "/home/btuser/myspace/torrents/watch/001/Web in Space (Doctor Who_ Eleventh Doctor) - David Bailey [EPUB] [RETAIL] (777903).torrent.added" |
[20:29:09] <new_guest_21> perl -0777 -ne '/GENERAL\s*Name: (.*?)\s*Hash: (.*)\s*/s && print "$1\n$2\n";'`
[20:29:21] <new_guest_21> Oops
[20:29:34] <new_guest_21> `perl -0777 -ne '/GENERAL\s*Name: (.*?)\s*Hash: (.*)\s*/s && print "$1\n$2\n";'``
[20:30:05] <new_guest_21> But it prints the matched groups and also the rest that follows
[20:30:09] <new_guest_21> What am I missing?
[20:30:41] <fizzie> The latter (.*) still matches *everything*.
[20:30:58] <fizzie> So do e.g. the suggested Hash: (\S*) to match non-whitespace only.
[20:30:59] <aquanight> simcop2387: perlbot seems to have some slowness for some reason
[20:31:10] <new_guest_21> Shoot I missed the ?
[20:31:24] <aquanight> ok
[20:31:35] <aquanight> new_guest_21: I got it to work with (/^GENERAL/ .. /^TRACKERS/) and /(Name|Hash): /p and print ${^POSTMATCH}
[20:31:38] <new_guest_21> Okay, adding the ? for Hash: (.*?) makes $2 print blank
[20:32:17] <fizzie> new_guest_21: Yes, it would. Because the shortest possible way to match (.*) followed by \s* is just make the (.*) part match the empty string.
[20:32:28] <aquanight> the first bit uses the flipflop operator to basically define a boundary to look in (it's true when it sees the "GENERAL" line and stays true until "TRACKERS")
[20:32:45] <fizzie> new_guest_21: If you *want* to use (.*?), you'd need Hash: (.*?)\s+ or something, to force the .*? to match up to next whitespace.
[20:32:59] <fizzie> But I do like that line-based approach.
[20:33:22] <aquanight> something to keep in mind is that the order of Name/Hash with my approach will be the same order as they appear in the output
[20:33:26] <fizzie> Assuming you can rely on the ordering in the input, since you're not specifically extracting Name: and Hash:, you're just printing whatever's after Name: or Hash: in that... right.
[20:33:32] <aquanight> if you need to force them in a specific order, that's also doable
[20:33:43] <new_guest_21> Ah, earlier I was doing `-0777 -ne` which is why it didn't work. Now it does! Thank you aquanight
[20:34:12] <new_guest_21> But I'd still like to figure that final piece of what I was trying earlier, just for the sake of learning.
[20:34:37] <aquanight> for the simplest solution there
[20:34:40] <aquanight> change \s* to \s+
[20:34:54] <new_guest_21> Regarding order, yes, they'll. I can always change it if it changes. :)
[20:35:02] <new_guest_21> Ah! right, let me go check...
[20:35:12] <LeoNerd> Someone remind me because I have clearly forgotten: how do I specify  :encoding(UTF-8)  while opening an in-memory filehnadle?  open my $fh, ">", \my $data;
[20:35:35] <aquanight> LeoNerd: don't you just slap it on after the var?
[20:35:49] <aquanight> like open my $fd, ">", \my $data, ":encoding(UTF-8)"
[20:36:18] <new_guest_21> Brilliant aquanight ! That did it! I have 2 solutions now and will attempt to understand the new one.
[20:36:48] <aquanight> new_guest_21: another option you can use, by using the /m flag on your regex you can use $ to target end-of-line positions directly
[20:36:53] <new_guest_21> Thank you fizzie , xenu , and aquanight ! You all have a great day! (I can finally go rest now. Been at it for hours!)
[20:37:15] <LeoNerd> More than one argument to open(,':scalar') at ...
[20:37:19] <new_guest_21> Oh...
[20:37:26] <aquanight> for example: /(...stuff I'm not repating...)Name: (.*?)$\s*Hash:(.*?)$/m
[20:37:29] <LeoNerd> Eh; I'll ->binmode it
[20:37:55] <aquanight> LeoNerd: oh it's ">:encoding(UTF-8)"

[20:45:04] <new_guest_21> aquanight : Nope. Still gives blank output.
[20:45:05] <LeoNerd> but maybe that doesn't really fit print's model
[20:45:14] <LeoNerd> I'll have to decode it again, no huge problem
[20:45:26] <aquanight> new_guest_21: hmm. weird. Maybe I'm wrong about how $ works then.
[20:45:42] <new_guest_21> I see...
[20:45:50] <aquanight> I'll have to mess with it some more
[20:46:05] <aquanight> but it's probably not really worth worrying about much when you already have two working options
[20:46:21] <aquanight> and I'd be more inclined if perlbot wasn't acting weird
[20:47:07] <aquanight> LeoNerd: so just to understand you were wanting to append a unicode character to a string and have said string still be unicode?
[20:47:28] <aquanight> and for some reason do this... through a filehandle?
[20:47:42] <aquanight> I guess I'm just trying to understand what the end goal here is.
[20:47:43] <new_guest_21> aquanight : It actually works. Sorry. I excluded the `-0777 ` flag by mistake. You were right!
[20:47:48] <LeoNerd> I'm doing it through a filehandle because I am lazy
[20:47:52] <aquanight> ok
[20:47:55] <LeoNerd> I have lots of code that just does "print", to stdout
[20:48:02] <LeoNerd> I want to unit-test it. so I capture it into a var instead
[20:48:06] <aquanight> aaaaaah
[20:48:10] <LeoNerd> Works 99% of the time, except one annoying case when it prints Unicode
[20:48:33] <LeoNerd> I can't be bothered to chgange /all/ my code to return a string and then print it just so that the unit test can call the generation function directly
[20:48:35] <aquanight> so you redirect STDOUT to your perlio scalar
[20:48:58] <LeoNerd> indeed
[20:49:05] <LeoNerd> (well, no... I just make a new scalar and 'select' it)
[20:49:07] <aquanight> and you were hoping to just throw a normal regex at it or something
[20:49:20] <aquanight> oh yeah
[20:49:32] <aquanight> I forget that stuff that just blindly does 'print "Foo"' can get dicked around by a random select
[20:49:49] <aquanight> I still want 'local select $fd' to be a thing
[20:49:59] <LeoNerd> Yeah that would be fun
[20:50:02] <aquanight> or even 'my select $fd' to make it only have lexical effect rather than dynamic
[20:50:39] <aquanight> hmmm. actually that would make more sense as a pragma
[20:50:56] <aquanight> eh no it needs to effect the I/O vars too
[20:51:03] <aquanight> affect
[20:51:05] <aquanight> anyway
[20:51:22] <Grinnz> LeoNerd: in memory scalars are bytes because anything else you open a filehandle to is bytes

[20:55:50] <Grinnz> but also, Encode::decode doesn't throw exceptions by default

[20:56:01] <aquanight> doens't it just return undef
[20:56:11] <Grinnz> it places replacement characters
[20:56:16] <aquanight> ah
[20:56:33] <aquanight> I guess that would be the preferred option
[20:56:38] <aquanight> for most unicode scenarios
[20:56:46] <Grinnz> a lot of times, but so are exceptions a lot of times
[20:56:50] <Grinnz> thus, Encode::Simple provides both
[20:56:57] <xenu> tbh falling back to replacement characters is almost always better than throwing an exception
[20:57:06] <xenu> yeah, what aquanight said
[20:57:10] <aquanight> I suppose it depends on the use scenario
[20:57:23] <aquanight> if you're processing unicode for rendering, replacement characters
[20:57:45] <aquanight> ...
[20:57:50] <Grinnz> if you're validating input, you often want exceptions
[20:58:10] <aquanight> yeah that's true
[20:58:41] <aquanight> since an invalid character is probably going to fail your input constraints anyway
[20:58:48] <xenu> speaking of unicode input, you should pretty much always normalize it but people rarely do this
[20:59:33] <aquanight> I always see it as "handle what you need to handle and leave the rest of the input unmolested"
[21:00:03] <aquanight> like dealing with markup processing or something. Look for the characters you need, the bit between them leave unchanged - let the next layer deal with it.
[21:01:56] <xenu> yeah, you can often get away with treating input as bytes and it will be faster

[22:08:26] <perlbot> gordonfish: Data is: Hello
[22:08:28] <simcop2387> seems so
[22:08:45] <gordonfish> I got the same timeout someone else did from that code in a PM 2 min ago
[22:08:52] <simcop2387> that's odd
[22:09:12] <gordonfish> How it appears to be working every time
[22:09:37] <simcop2387> let me disable the swap on the host (it's not very in use but maybe something weird)
[22:09:42] <gordonfish> I've gotten more "Hello"s from perlbot than the Beetles
[22:09:48] <simcop2387> perlbot: hello
[22:09:48] <perlbot> simcop2387: Hi :) Have a look around!
[22:09:51] <simcop2387> perlbot: fuck you
[22:09:52] <perlbot> simcop2387: D:
[22:10:43] <simcop2387> i'm at the slow part of the copy to the new disks so that might be part of it too.  there's a really fragmented and terrible area around the end of the first vdev that goes really fucking slow so maybe it's an io issue too
[22:10:45] <gordonfish> perlbot: fuck
[22:10:45] <perlbot> gordonfish: let's not and say we did
[22:10:48] <gordonfish> heh
[22:10:59] <simcop2387> perlbot: what is my purpose?
[22:11:03] <perlbot> simcop2387: You fill me with shit
[22:11:14] <gordonfish> TIL perlbot is also a septic tank
[22:11:43] <simcop2387> gordonfish: everyone has a different purpose according to perlbot
[22:12:41] <gordonfish> "You fill me right round, baby, right round, like a septic tank, right round here I flush"
[22:14:06] <gordonfish> perlbot: what is my purpose?

[22:32:32] <simcop2387> or i've got the one by my desk configured incorrectly
[22:34:46] <daemon> why whats it doing
[22:34:49] <daemon> or whats going on
[22:35:20] <simcop2387> i plugged it in and the network crashed
[22:35:28] <daemon> crashed how
[22:35:31] <daemon> you lost a port?
[22:35:38] <simcop2387> flood it looked like
[22:35:44] <simcop2387> not doing it now
[22:35:47] <daemon> hmm
[22:35:57] <mst> argument between the switches as to which one's going to be the dom for this scene
[22:36:04] <daemon> yeah auto negotiation
[22:36:39] <daemon> though that does not normally create an excess traffic spike for more than a couple of millisecond
[22:37:03] <daemon> perhaps an argument between the two switches on what should be done, one saying a higher speed the other lower
[22:37:13] <simcop2387> i do like how the mikrotik switch calls all my transcievers 850nm fiber though
[22:37:31] <jabberwok> packet storm!  flashback to trying to manually configure BGP on a bespoke hybrid microwave/cable/isdn computer/phone/video hookup 2003
[22:38:16] <simcop2387> ok going to swap a cable to the 10g-t transceiver on the rack.  shouldn't look like anything to you guys
[22:38:39] <daemon> depends how you live broadcast it to how it looks like for us I guess :P
[22:39:20] <simcop2387> perldoc: hi
[22:39:20] <perlbot> simcop2387: Your documentation is available at: https://perldoc.perl.org/hi
[22:39:55] <daemon> oh speaking of broadcasting stuff have any of you got 3 identical office pc's p3-p6 free?
[22:40:05] <daemon> old office equipment really
[22:40:43] <daemon> thinking of doing a series of BSD videos and looking for 3 identical older machines for net open and free
[22:40:56] <daemon> can grep them off ebay of course but wondered if anyone had anything laying about
[22:41:34] <keir> is "to grep" an actual verb?
[22:41:44] <keir> in this context that is
[22:41:45] <daemon> in my dictionary yes, for normal people probably not :)
[22:42:10] <keir> is grepping a method of purchase?
[22:42:25] <daemon> my brain has symlinked grep to 'filtered get'
[22:42:27] <mst> daemon: sounds like something #london.pm (or the attached mailing list) might have better responses to
[22:42:51] <daemon> did not even know that was a channel
[22:43:02] <keir> daemon: you're in London?
[22:43:06] <mst> magnet rather than here, but sure, has been forever
[22:43:12] <daemon> keir, the uk, not london
[22:43:22] <daemon> its not a channel here
[22:43:25] <keir> daemon: hi from Birmingham
[22:43:25] <daemon> its empty :
[22:43:30] <mst> well of course not
[22:43:31] <daemon> keir, Lincolnshire here
[22:43:38] <mst> this is the libera outpost of irc.perl.org
[22:43:48] <mst> the main channels are on the real thing :P
[22:44:28] <daemon> keir, well Lincolnshire or Warwickshire (its complicated) house move stuff
[22:44:35] <daemon> I kind of exist in both at different times :)
[22:44:55] <jabberwok> Pronunciation: what would "Warwick" rhyme with?
[22:45:05] <daemon> cock whip
[22:45:07] <keir> jabberwok: davis
[22:45:08] <mst> yorick?
[22:45:15] <keir> daemon: which is the destination?
[22:45:37] <daemon> keir, that is a little complicated as well ... I want a small farm in lincolnshire, but my job is in rugby (warwicksire)
[22:45:37] <simcop2387> alright new switch is configured.  10g port is tagged for everything, as is 5g and the 1g port.
[22:45:50] <daemon> so the direct targy is warwickshire, the end goal is lincolnshire
[22:45:52] <simcop2387> this'll be more disruptive but i'll be right back
[22:46:21] <keir> daemon: are you commuting? that's an insane distance to commute
[22:46:32] <daemon> keir, yes its nearly 5 and a half hours on public transport -_-
[22:46:34] <daemon> one way
[22:46:56] <keir> hope you're getting something productive done on the train
[22:47:02] <keir> that's a lot of life lost on a train
[22:47:10] <jabberwok> time on a train is never wasted
[22:47:12] <daemon> well because of covid etc ... work and me have an agreement, basically I come into hte office when required
[22:47:16] <daemon> and that is pretty rare
[22:47:18] <daemon> so it works out
[22:48:07] <daemon> what I would really love to do though is get a small farmland in the north of scotland
[22:48:18] <daemon> but eh we see
[22:48:52] <daemon> and yeah I purchased a Lenovo Carbon X1 6th series because of trains :)
[22:48:55] <daemon> it does very very well
[22:49:07] <daemon> my office is wherever I happen to be at the time
[22:49:25] <keir> Warwick is nice though
[22:49:28] <keir> so i've heard
[22:49:33] <daemon> ~~
[22:49:36] <keir> never really visited
[22:49:42] <daemon> its very polite and well kind of posh
[22:49:59] <daemon> but it does not have the mountains, scenary and character of derbyshire, scotland or lincolnshire

My last name comes from a village (currently population 50) but there was a slight bit of nastyness between the times of Charles I and Charles II which eventually led to my being in Kentucky instead.

[22:55:04] <keir> especially on the outskirts
