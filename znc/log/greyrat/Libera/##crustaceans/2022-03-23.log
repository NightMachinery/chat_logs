[01:15:06] <kronk> that's been a mainstay since fucking fortran.
[01:15:17] <Brekkjern> What is?
[01:15:38] <kronk> stuff && like && this
[01:15:51] <kronk> or stuff > like && these == expressions
[01:16:03] <Brekkjern> && isn't a thing in Python either
[01:16:08] <leon> blu: there's this https://www.zsa.io/planck, but it's not DIY
[01:16:12] <kronk> we're talking about zig.
[01:16:20] <kronk> scroll back.
[01:24:52] <blu> yeah saw that but
[01:28:03] <blu> not a fan of the case
[01:28:21] <blu> seems like 40%s are a bit hard to find rn
[01:54:22] <Brekkjern> kronk: Yes. I know, but it's not a universal feature.
[01:54:41] <kronk> ..find me a language that doesn't do it that isn't assembly.
[01:54:56] <Brekkjern> && is not a thing in Python either as I said.
[01:55:02] <Brekkjern> The keyword is "and"
[01:55:08] <kronk> so you didn't scroll back lmfao.
[01:55:13] <kronk> it's not about && vs. 'and'.
[01:55:19] <kronk> it's about chaining/combining expressions.
[01:55:22] <kronk> see twitter link above.
[01:55:27] <Brekkjern> The dude was using the wrong operator
[01:55:37] <Brekkjern> Of course operator chaining doesn't work when you are using the wrong operator.
[01:55:45] <Brekkjern> It wouldn't work in Python either because && isn't a thing
[01:55:55] <kronk> wait they changed && to 'and'? when the fuck..
[01:56:26] <Brekkjern> That's what I got from that Twitter thread
[01:56:26] <kronk> I'm spoiled by TheLounge as it auto-expands for me.
[01:56:45] <kronk> so I'm half a hypocrite.

[01:57:54] <Brekkjern> Err, maybe that "and" wasn't meant as the "and" operator
[01:58:00] <Brekkjern> But && has no matches in that entire document.

[03:18:30] <Brekkjern> Putin doesn't give a single fuck about the soldiers or the equipment lost. It's probably a bonus as it means that there's not much materiell or personell to attempt a coup with later. Ukraine is also rich in resources and Putin wants to rebuild a regime that is immune to sanctions. The only way to do that would be to have so much of the eurasian resources (oil, gas, metals, food) that Europe has to trade with them no matter what they do. China
[03:18:30] <Brekkjern> would still be desperate for the raw materials anyways, so it's not like the initial sanctions would hurt all that much in the grand scheme of things. The very long term play here is somewhat sound.

[14:37:58] <Brekkjern> Honestly, I think it's "legit" :P
[14:38:27] <Brekkjern> Especially since it contains comments like this: "We occasionally supplement this approach with human analysis of films, but depend on it less following the indignant resignation of our postdoctoral fellow."

[15:09:20] <kline> even better
[15:09:37] <epilys> the position is rust evangelist

[15:14:42] <epilys> jjuran, any writeups/blog posts?
[15:21:05] <jjuran> epilys: No, maybe because I'm still learning my way around and don't have much to say yet

[16:34:04] <epilys> Brekkjern, ty! :D
[16:34:48] <epilys> oh no, 22% income taxes :x
[16:42:31] <Brekkjern> Not more?
[16:44:33] <epilys> normally it's 42% but because it's from a USA company they can't hire me directly, I will have to be paid as a "capital holding corporation" that has lower tax rates
[16:47:45] <Brekkjern> 42% sounds much more like it :P
[16:50:20] <epilys> oh. I thought I was paying only 8% before, but seems like my accountant had misinformed me. 8% is for <22.000 euros per year, but I was making more so right now I'm at 42% anyway
[16:51:07] <epilys> he thought I'd be getting greek-level income, where the minimum salary is 600 euros per month I guess

[22:20:15] <epilys> (that was the reasoning behind the Guillotine's invention in the French Revolution)
[23:22:28] <gerikson> epilys: it was invented and proposed before the revolution as a more humane way to execute people
[23:22:47] <gerikson> you didn't need a higly trained executioner who knew how to behead people
[23:22:53] <gerikson> same result every time
[23:22:59] <gerikson> modern!
[23:23:03] <Brekkjern> That shell script thread is such a shitshow :P
[23:23:11] <edk> it's pretty strange that it took us so long to realise that you can just... not execute them
[23:24:38] <gerikson> ``A death penalty opponent, he was displeased with the breaking wheel and other common and gruesome methods of execution and sought to persuade Louis XVI of France to implement a less painful alternative.''
[23:24:58] <gerikson> edk: last execution by guillotine in France was in 1977...
[23:25:23] <edk> it's surprisingly late right
[23:25:41] <epilys> actually, the guilotine as we know it (the long pointed blade) and the head circle crescent is from the revolution :)
[23:25:47] <epilys> designed by a guy named Guillotine
[23:25:47] <edk> like contemporary death penalty countries are trying to make their executions at least appear less violent
[23:26:05] <edk> and here the french are just straight up beheading mofos
[23:26:45] <epilys> (I have this on paper https://books.google.gr/books/about/Guillotine_Its_Legend_and_Lore.html?id=4DvaAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y )
[23:26:46] <buttsbot> Guillotine, Its Legend and Lore - Daniel Charles Gerould - Î’Î¹Î²Î»Î¯Î± Google
[23:27:00] <gerikson> ``France's official executioner, Charles-Henri Sanson, claimed in his memoirs that King Louis XVI (an amateur locksmith) recommended that the device employ an oblique blade rather than a crescent one, lest the blade not be able to cut through all necks; the neck of the king, who would eventually die by guillotine years later, was offered up discreetly as an example.''
[23:27:21] <gerikson> so just pre-revolution
[23:28:22] <gerikson> Brekkjern: #!/usr/bin/env git-gud
[23:28:24] <epilys> beheading via falling blade is recorded in history in general (I think most notably in scotland? or somewhere close)
[23:28:28] <gerikson> yep
[23:28:36] <epilys> but Guillotine is a french thing, named after the guy
[23:29:09] <Brekkjern> gerikson: I fucking hate the shell in the Linux world. It's such a shitshow and people have just internalized that shitshow and thinks it's normal...
[23:29:59] <epilys> There's no other rational way than hating it, so you're not alone
[23:30:02] <edk> have you considered joining forces with jordi
[23:30:15] <edk> i mean you both seem to think that the rest of the world exists on a lesser plane of awareness
[23:30:29] <epilys> haha
[23:31:20] <gerikson> ``In South Vietnam, after the Diá»‡m regime enacted the 10/59 Decree in 1959, mobile special military courts were dispatched to the countryside in order to intimidate the rural population; they used guillotines, which had belonged to the former French colonial power, in order to carry out death sentences on the spot.''

[23:34:02] <Brekkjern> edk: Of course it works. Doesn't mean it's good.

[23:34:28] <epilys> "I guess I need to do a blog post about this ?"
[23:34:30] <gerikson> then setting it on fire!
[23:34:34] <gwozniak> I know its limits, and don't push them.  It's also not something that can easily be removed
[23:35:11] <Brekkjern> No, they are saying "It's not that hard. Just mitigate all these known failure modes by enabling these 7 settings and run these two programs on your scripts to make sure you won't accidentally delete the /usr catalogue because a variable was erronously not filled"
[23:35:16] <edk> friendlysock is saying it's easy to navigate its awfulness by following a long list of rules. that's not the same thing. i don't think anyone is trying to say that they don't think shell would be better if you didn't have to follow a long list of rules
[23:35:18] <gerikson> oh great now people are moaning about make
[23:35:28] <gwozniak> Really, it's processes with very simple invocation that's the appeal.  It's really simple glue
[23:35:37] <edk> yeah
[23:35:56] <edk> shell is a bad programming language because it's a UI that happens to be automatable
[23:36:22] <gwozniak> It's terrible for anything "program-y", like data manipulation
[23:36:34] <edk> yes
[23:36:48] <edk> a big reason i use shell so much, honestly, is that other programming languages are just so bad at invoking programs
[23:37:02] <gwozniak> yeah
[23:37:08] <gwozniak> I tried Python and it was annoying
[23:37:23] <edk> in ruby there are like 7 official ways of doing it, and 6 of them are just begging to be shell-injected
[23:37:50] <edk> python is a little less bad in that it doesn't have so many convenient but wrong interfaces to use, but the right interface is still pretty verbose
[23:39:54] <epilys> yeah and then try piping stuff around, the loc count goes up
[23:42:42] <ngoldbaum> i feel like perl is a much nicer shell replacement than python
[23:42:56] <ngoldbaum> because itâ€™s way easier to invoke subprocesses in a shell-like manner
[23:43:10] <ngoldbaum> but people donâ€™t like perl so
[23:43:32] <gwozniak> I just wrote something where Perl would have been great, but I chose shell because Perl isn't something the rest of the team is familiar with
[23:44:18] <gwozniak> I almost used Python, but I had to run enough other processes that I didn't want to bother.  Maybe I will anyway, just to see what it's like
[23:44:33] <ngoldbaum> the subprocess api is totally shit
[23:44:48] <gwozniak> Yeah, I have used it extensively in the past
[23:44:53] <Brekkjern> I'm not sure why people are suggesting Python as if that is a solution TBH
[23:44:56] <ngoldbaum> so overly complicated for marginal reasons
[23:45:25] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: what would be a solution, then?
[23:45:31] <epilys> I don't want to scare anyone, but
[23:45:33] <epilys> https://github.com/google/zx
[23:45:33] <buttsbot> GitHub - google/zx: A tool for writing better scripts
[23:45:35] <epilys> :D
[23:45:51] <ngoldbaum> only ever heard terrible things about zx from xooglers
[23:46:16] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: Not insisting on using shit that was hodgepodged together over several decades when we have the ability to make something new that is designed for the purpose.
[23:47:01] <Brekkjern> Choosing Python for this task is just to make the same mistake all over again
[23:47:21] <Brekkjern> Now you'd start modifying Python to make it more practical to use in a shell, but suddenly it's a total shitshow again
[23:49:01] <companion_cube> there's the `sh` library iirc
[23:49:08] <epilys> I don't want to be mean, Brekkjern but these complains have probably been made daily ever since the day the unix shell was invented
[23:49:50] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: lol https://xon.sh
[23:49:50] <buttsbot> The Xonsh Shell â€” Python-powered shell
[23:49:58] <epilys> like, yeah, it's shit but it's not adding anything new to complain about it all the time
[23:49:59] <Brekkjern> epilys: Likely, and they have probably been met with "But just git gud" since the day before it was invented.
[23:50:01] <ngoldbaum> imo shoving shell concepts into pythonâ€¦ doesnâ€™t work at all
[23:50:49] <epilys> Brekkjern, learn to ignore toxic people/behaviors!
[23:50:56] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: I didn't know of that one, but I did read someones guide on how to write something like that by overloading python operators into an absolute shitshow of a shell
[23:51:33] <Brekkjern> epilys: Then what the fuck should I spend my time doing instead? I'm trying to procrastinate from my homework!
[23:51:34] <ngoldbaum> xonsh is its own thing with its own parser, itâ€™s basically python and bash combined
[23:51:49] <epilys> Brekkjern, read "Unix haters handbook"? https://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf
[23:51:59] <ngoldbaum> and itâ€™s way too complicated to hold in my head so i stopped using it
[23:52:11] <Brekkjern> Also, just to throw this out there. The word "bÃ¦sj" is pronounced very similar to "bash" in Norwegian, and it literally means "shit"
[23:52:18] <epilys> haha

[23:52:24] <Brekkjern> epilys: No, but I probably should.
[23:52:25] <epilys> almost nominative determinism
[23:52:36] <epilys> Brekkjern, it's a fun casual read, but also dated ofc
[23:52:50] <Brekkjern> epilys: It will fit right in with the rest of the design of Linux
[23:53:30] <epilys> I will quote the anti-foreword Dennis Ritchie made for this book
[23:53:36] <epilys> "Here is my metaphor: your book is a pudding stuffed with apposite
[23:53:36] <epilys> observations, many well-conceived. Like excrement, it contains
[23:53:36] <epilys> enough undigested nuggets of nutrition to sustain life for some. But
[23:53:36] <epilys> it is not a tasty pie: it reeks too much of contempt and of envy."
[23:55:03] <epilys> (sorry for the linebreaks) I just love the vibe from this book.
