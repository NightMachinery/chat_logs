[16:58:46] <jetchisel> I hope `set -x` explain em all ^^
[16:59:40] <wwilliam> OK so in a dir with many recon.zip files and many IR_ASOA.zip files how do i do that?
[17:00:28] <jetchisel> Good question! so after that whats next? ^^
[17:02:09] <jetchisel> A for loop.
[17:02:29] <wwilliam> Keep in mind the number changes as the days go by
[17:02:51] <wwilliam> like tomorrow is going to be 20210712time
[17:02:56] <wwilliam> and so on.
[17:03:10] <wwilliam> so take this list of files:
[17:03:26] <gnoo> can xargs have a counter like it has ran n times and so
[17:03:38] <gnoo> ?
[17:03:41] <jetchisel> Right, keep tabs on what you have parsed/processed and skip em, on the next loop/iteration.
[17:04:04] <djph> or delete them from the working directory
[17:04:18] <jetchisel> ^^
[17:04:45] <wwilliam> once the whole process finished they will be deleted this is the first part of a "script"
[17:05:04] <wwilliam> I need to make list of those files to rsync them and process them
[17:05:16] * djph hates remote parties who don't let us move/delete files we pickup via sftp (whatever) and then we keep getting 80 bazillion duplicate failures
[17:05:36] <jetchisel> That's fun ^^
[17:05:50] <djph> thankfully, we do checksums and keep them in a database
[17:06:04] <wwilliam> The following command list files with the correspondent recon, I need to group them like txt files for every group.
[17:06:06] <djph> so it's just 80 bazillion errors that we send back and charge them for
[17:06:07] <djph> :D

[21:51:18] <thebombzen_> is there seriously no risk to not quoting during assignment?
[21:52:03] <kurahaupo> thebombzen_: correct
[21:52:03] <thebombzen_> I write something like: input_file=${1:-input.txt}
[21:52:05] <earnestly> kurahaupo: A nice aspect of resorting to named pipes is that it usually results in creating a little namespace under /tmp to store all these meta files, which then exposes more latitude to use files for data structuring.  I've always had nice experiences with this
[21:52:40] <earnestly> thebombzen_: Because the implicit split($variable, IFS); doesn't take place during assignment
[21:52:57] <earnestly> pseudocode*
[21:52:58] <kurahaupo> earnestly: that's fine until you actually want them to be ephemeral; then you have to go to the trouble of removing them
[21:53:36] *** Joins: jmcantrell (~weechat@user/jmcantrell)
[21:53:40] <thebombzen_> so, something like this is safe? for example: no_underscores=$(printf %s "$my_far" | tr '_' ' ')
[21:53:43] <earnestly> kurahaupo: By creating a namespace under /tmp the entire thing can be cleaned up in a rm -r, it also lets you set permissions/umasks etc. for the content
[21:54:09] <thebombzen_> is this assignment safety a property of BASH or is it true about shell command language, i.e. #!/bin/sh scripts as well?
[21:54:16] <earnestly> kurahaupo: plan9port implements namespaces like this, 0700 directory under /tmp.  Cleaning up is annoying, but can be made simpler
[21:54:54] <earnestly> Certainly better than trying to herd a load of random files under /tmp
[21:55:00] <thebombzen_> earnestly: what if the spaces already exist in the assignment
[21:55:07] <kurahaupo> thebombzen_: it's guaranteed by POSIX
[21:55:15] <earnestly> thebombzen_: Then it needs to be quoted, so that it is correctly grouped
[21:55:18] <jetchisel> 100%
[21:55:21] <thebombzen_> for example, what about this? user_name=Linus Torvalds
[21:55:29] <thebombzen_> that needs to be quoted?
[21:55:30] <earnestly> Yes, you need to quote the space
[21:55:43] <thebombzen_> but in that case the quoting is not to protect against expansion but to just properly tokenize, is what your'e saying
[21:55:49] <earnestly> thebombzen_: Remember that quotes in the shell are about grouping things.  It's not like python
[21:56:01] *** Joins: tech_exorcist (txrcst@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479)

[21:56:13] <earnestly> thebombzen_: I.e. \ is a quote (not an escape)
[21:56:27] <earnestly> Linus\ Torvalds.  This quotes the space so that the shell treats it literally
[21:56:43] <thebombzen_> so user_name=Linus\ Torvalds would assign his name to that variable, in that case
[21:57:11] <emanuele6> # user_name=Linus Torvalds
[21:57:12] <shbot> emanuele6: bash: Torvalds: command not found
[21:57:23] <emanuele6> # user_name=Linus\ Torvalds
[21:57:23] <thebombzen_> ah, right, that's like ld_preload=foo bar
[21:57:25] <shbot> emanuele6: no output
[21:57:28] <earnestly> foo=${1:-bar baz} # doesn't need to be quoted
[21:57:40] <thebombzen_> I see, since the {} serves to group already
[21:57:50] <thebombzen_> what about other characters that sometimes need to be protected, like ! or ;does \; and \! work the same way as it does in this case? 
[21:58:15] *** Joins: jaggz (~jaggz@user/jaggz)
[21:58:36] <earnestly> thebombzen_: Although {} are not used for grouping strings, only quotes do that (everything is a string in the shell, all is interpreted as commands with arguments)
[21:58:48] <jaggz> cat | strings & strpid="$!"; echo "strpid: $strpid"; sleep 1; kill "$strpid"
[21:59:14] <earnestly> thebombzen_: It's all strings, so those characters need to be quoted where it makes sense that you don't want the shell to interpret them as meta characters
[21:59:28] <jaggz> when I fg cat | strings it sits there until I hit enter, when it'll say Terminated.
[21:59:45] <thebombzen_> I see, so meta characters like &, or ;, the value of IFS all need to be quoted, which can potentially be done with a \ instead of "
[22:00:09] <earnestly> thebombzen_: If you use ; in a context where the shell interprets the ; as the end of a command, then you need to quote it so that the shell doesn't
[22:00:29] <thebombzen_> quotations not being needed on assignment is only to prevent splitting the assignment on IFS after expansion from $(), I see
[22:00:29] *** Joins: paulgrmn (~paulgrmn@user/paulgrmn)
[22:00:31] <earnestly> thebombzen_: \ " and ' (and $') are all forms of quoting
[22:00:35] <earnestly> They do different things
[22:00:55] <earnestly> thebombzen_: quoting is needed in contexts where wordsplitting takes place
[22:01:19] <earnestly> Inside $() is a subshell, and so is not part of the assignment
[22:01:24] <thebombzen_> so basically you're saying that assignment just skips wordsplitting, but nothing else is particularly special about it
[22:01:34] <thebombzen_> so if you have to quote for other reasons, then you still need to do that
[22:01:46] <earnestly> assignment is one such place where wordsplitting doesn't happen, also in the variable based to case
[22:01:55] <earnestly> case $noquoteshere in ...
[22:02:13] <earnestly> Or in bash, the RHS of a [[ context
[22:02:20] <earnestly> [[ $foo = "$bar" ]]
[22:02:26] <thebombzen_> that's LHS but ye
[22:03:01] <earnestly> Yeah, but that's only because it interprets the value as a glob
[22:03:04] <emanuele6> well, "word splitting" doesn't happen in the RHS either. does it?
[22:03:14] <kurahaupo> thebombzen_: it also doesn't glob
[22:03:35] <thebombzen_> so in BASH i can use something like, if [[ $var = "true" ]]; then, but in [ ] contexts in either bash or posix, I have to do if [ "$var" = "true" ] ; then
[22:03:41] <emanuele6> you need to quote it because to not make bash interpret it as a pattern, but i don't think word splitting happens
[22:03:56] <earnestly> There's no need to put quotes around "true" because true is already a plain string
[22:04:08] <kurahaupo> The = operator in [[ ]] is a misnomer - it's not equality, it's pattern match
[22:04:14] <thebombzen_> yea, okay
[22:04:15] <earnestly> thebombzen_: In POSIX sh, [ is a command, like ls.  So it needs to be quoted like normal
[22:04:38] <emanuele6> earnestly: no, it's a builtin
[22:04:39] <thebombzen_> ye, although don't most posix-complaint shells use [ as a builtin, even when executing a #!/bin/sh script?
[22:04:43] <earnestly> emanuele6: Irrelevant
[22:05:12] <earnestly> The distinction doesn't really matter between builtins and "PATH commands" when it comes to how arguments work
[22:05:17] <kurahaupo> thebombzen_: You never need to put "" around a word like "true"
[22:05:35] <thebombzen_> ye, I know that, that was just a brain fart
[22:06:00] <earnestly> [[ otoh is a keyword, the shell has its own rules for parsing it at a level higher than the command line
