[00:04:38] <Bayes> nice, this paper tries 113 model configurations to compare input projection method, input projection dimension, covariance function, subset of predictors
[00:07:57] <Bayes> except very few bad mdoels, they all achieve similar .65-.75 prediction R^2
[00:08:40] <Bayes> there's only so much model selection can add to these problems

[18:10:51] <Bayes> somebody asks "why do use lower case" in an abbreviation, can I just say because I can?
[18:10:55] <Bayes> let the rant begin
[18:12:51] <Bayes> also "I_{i, k}" for an indicator function, I get asked "Why not I(i == j)?"
[18:12:57] <Bayes> because this is a paper and not R ? :D
[18:13:01] <Bayes> wtf man
[18:30:28] <Bayes> is there any place where the R core team keeps track of things they're discussing for future versions?
[18:30:49] <Bayes> public notes or something
[18:46:06] <confuzeus> see here https://developer.r-project.org/ ?
[18:57:50] *** julius is now known as raffaem
[20:01:52] <Bayes> hm
[20:02:14] <Bayes> kinda crazy all they have is just a series of random text files here and there?
[20:02:21] <Bayes> I wish the dev list was public, at least for reading
[20:03:13] <Bayes> one of the TODOs has creating a use() function to wrap around library and/or require
[20:03:28] <Bayes> and also an npm() function to manage packages based on debian apt
[20:04:20] <Bayes> https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2021/12/14/updating-graphics-devices-for-r-4.2.0/index.html grouping in graphics could be cool if it's what I think they mean by groupping
[20:04:37] <Bayes> and compositing operators :D
[20:19:22] <Bayes> https://cran.r-project.org/search.html hm that nabble link doesn't work for me ?

[20:59:49] <__that__> Hi all
[21:00:05] <fendur> o/
[21:01:12] <__that__> What is the best practise to install packages in R and handle projects? In Python I can create a virtual environment where I can install locally the libraries I need for my project
[21:01:18] <__that__> is there anything similar in R?
[21:02:23] <mefistofeles> __that__: the only thing I know is using anaconda/conda environments which can handle R and R packages
[21:02:48] <mefistofeles> I know they are somewhat controversial with folks around here, but they can come very handy at times
[21:03:07] <__that__> mefistofeles, so every time you restart your R studio you need to install the required packages for that project?
[21:03:24] <__that__> is there any shortcut to avoid having to install libraries all the time?
[21:04:42] <mefistofeles> __that__: no, you don't have to reinstall anything
[21:05:00] <mefistofeles> you create your conda environment, install the packages, and that's it, that environment will stay there as much as you want
[21:05:10] <__that__> so what's the lifecycle of packages then? I am confused. 
[21:05:11] <mefistofeles> you just have to activate it
[21:05:14] <__that__> Sure I mean without conda
[21:05:18] <mefistofeles> oh
[21:05:46] <__that__> thanks for the tip though
[21:05:50] <__that__> I'll use conda

[22:47:42] <Bayes> eh I missed all the fun
[22:47:50] <Bayes> nobody mentioned pakrat?
[22:48:23] <Bayes> also https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html
[22:48:28] <Bayes> there are a few alternatives there
[22:48:33] <Bayes> unfortunately the user left
[22:48:41] <Bayes> but I think I asked something similar a week ago or so
[22:49:25] <Bayes> ok so I fucked up reproducibility :(
[22:49:59] <Bayes> sad violin song
[22:53:58] <Bayes> I think I may want to try renv
[22:58:04] <Bayes> ok I have this little piece of code
[22:58:14] <Bayes> that I was hoping I could get some code feedback on
[22:58:31] <Bayes> because I do feel there might be a more natural, one liner using base only tools
[23:03:19] <Bayes> here: http://ix.io/3QqR I have a function that needs both the list element values and the list element name
[23:04:54] <Bayes> two things to note: doing unlist(l) to treat it as a named vector will eff up the vector names
[23:05:06] <Bayes> doing sapply(names(l), function(x) f(l[[x]], x)) will not return a vector
