[21:55:12] <rawktucc> only some true stuff I don't want to lose
[21:55:18] <evilgohan2> Optical _never_ works out long storage
[21:55:18] <rawktucc> stuff I know will never ever need to be modified
[21:55:26] <rawktucc> is it a cost thing, or access?
[21:55:29] <evilgohan2> ask the people who did CD-Rs, and DVD-/+Rs
[21:55:37] <rawktucc> but we went over this already
[21:55:39] <evilgohan2> Optical media wears down overtime.
[21:55:43] <rawktucc> blurays use an inorganic dye
[21:55:49] <Allie> optical totally works out for archive storage, assuming you buy the correct optical
[21:55:51] <rawktucc> or w hatever the one that doesn't wear down like CDs and DVDs
[21:55:53] <Allie> you cannot afford the correct optical
[21:56:04] <evilgohan2> ^
[21:56:07] <rawktucc> Allie I mean I can buy M-discs but they're stupid expensive and don't come in 128GB
[21:56:17] <Allie> as i said, you cannot afford the correct optical
[21:56:26] <rawktucc> I Can, I choose not to though :)
[21:56:59] <rawktucc> what would the "correct" optical be then?
[21:57:00] <rawktucc> tape?
[21:57:11] <evilgohan2> Tape isn't optical, it's magnetic.
[21:57:15] <Allie> sony ODA would be my choice for long-term optical archive storage
[21:57:20] <rawktucc> woof
[21:57:23] <evilgohan2> https://pro.sony/ue_US/products/optical-disc-archive-cartridges
[21:57:30] <rawktucc> that's a proprietary format and unit though, just like tape
[21:58:01] <rawktucc> at least they offer a USB 3.0 IO unit
[21:58:21] <Allie> that's one of the common standards for long-term program archiving in modern digital TV workflows
[21:59:17] <rawktucc> yeah it's so much better than tape, agreed
[21:59:22] <rawktucc> but I'm not really doing that kind of workflow
[21:59:28] <rawktucc> do you work in that field Allie?
[22:00:10] <Allie> aye
[22:00:29] <Allie> there's also Archival Disk, which is the physical format that ODA is based on
