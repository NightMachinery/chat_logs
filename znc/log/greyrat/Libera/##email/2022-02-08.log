[00:35:00] <ttys000> anyone here managed to get autodiscover working correctly with microsoft outlook and a linux based email server?
[00:35:19] <ttys000> i can see micrsoft requesting the xml file from my server: 
[00:35:20] <ttys000> 52.125.132.20 - - [07/Feb/2022:20:03:05 +0000] "GET /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml HTTP/1.1" 200 1425 "-" "-"
[00:36:02] <ttys000> and i believe my response is correctly formatted, e.g.: http://hcc10.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml
[00:36:50] <ttys000> outlook seems to grab the ports correctly from this, but the server is wrong.
[00:37:38] <ttys000> https://imgur.com/uyl27Hp
[00:37:46] <ttys000> should be mail.storwell.com not mail.hcc10.com
[00:37:59] <ttys000> i don't know how to fix :(

[12:35:10] <solsTiCe> hi. I was reading some doc about protocol and found out about BIMI. I thought it was cool and wanted my logo to be displyed in Inboxes. But wait, there is that VMC thing. so it is not free at all. No way, to do that BIMI thing for 0€ ?
[13:14:33] <Khepra> solsTiCe: what VMC thing
[13:15:32] <Khepra> HOLY SHI-  they made it possible to monetize CRAP again... JustSayNo. you can do the "self asserted" thing.

[16:26:39] <BranchPredictor> holy damn, 1500 USD per year for cert on image

[16:32:47] <Khepra> s/got/should get/
[16:35:01] <BranchPredictor> probably both
[16:37:03] <Khepra> just yet nother money grabbing scam
[16:38:18] <Khepra> and pretty soon, the MajorESPs(tm) will create The Email Deliverability Initiative, TEDI. To become a TEDI bear, you need to pay up $3999 yearly license. Otherwise, NoEmailFromYou(tm).
[16:39:40] <Khepra> and they'll package it up into a ThinkOfTheChildren Security Certification Programme, and EU Vogons^W Bureaucrats will swallow that like aspartame enhanced koolaid.
[16:40:07] <Khepra> you think this is vitriol? mark my words 10 years from now.

[16:50:10] <Khepra> is taht from the Life of Brian?
[16:50:19] <rob0> don't know if he was actually his son, but Peter called him "my son"
[16:50:43] <rob0> lol, <3 Life of Brian

[16:53:22] <Khepra> you think I was really joking about the Think of the Children Security Certification Programme Excuse For Every Kind Of Opressive Tech They Can And Will Install In Ur Serverz.
[16:53:43] <Khepra> I have to clean up some shiz first, but I believe this is teh year where I flip the table and quit tech for good. I'll go herd sheep. wool is needed for dynamite sticks that the resistance will plant in the bases of 5G cell towers.
[16:54:12] <rob0> Herding sheep?  That's baaaaaaaaaaad.
[16:54:23] <Khepra> baaaaaaaadum-tss.
[16:54:50] <Khepra> I'm not joking about that part tho. I'm burnt out. total. jelly's asking why I'm incendiary lately. I can't stand it any more. 
[16:55:01] <rob0> I get it.
[16:56:37] <rob0> Only 7 years for me to go for full retirement.  I'll make it.  What I do now is mostly fun.
