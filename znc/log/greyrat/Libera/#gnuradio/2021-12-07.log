[04:12:44] <johncc3> Hi all. Been trying to record audio with gqrx, but the recorded audio is distorted. I can change the audio level, but that doesn't seem to change the recording at all.
[04:13:41] <johncc3> I estimate I have to lower the audio about 50% to get the .wav gqrx records into the linear range (+/- 1). Any idea how to do that?
[04:21:57] <willcode4[m]> The audio gain control on the audio panel might do it.
[04:24:38] <johncc3> willcode4[m], Hi... No it doesn't. I changed the 'Gain' by more than 10 dB, and the audio to the speakers does vary, but the recording is still saturating.
[04:29:10] <willcode4[m]> Agree, it had no effect.
[04:30:07] <willcode4[m]> But the recorded audio was clear (NBFM on a local WX station). What were you recording?
[04:31:10] <willcode4[m]> To see if the audio is good at all, you could use `sox --norm=-3 infile.wav outfile.wav` and see what that sounds like.
[04:35:45] <johncc3> willcode4[m],  I used a program called 'snd' which shows the waveform on the screen. (it's part of an audio package from Stanford university)
[04:37:09] <johncc3> The audio is clearly saturating. Normal voice audio does reproduce quite good, but I wanted to apply some processing and that looses part of the amplitude info.
[04:38:56] <willcode4[m]> johncc3: What receiver mode and what signal?
[04:41:20] <willcode4[m]> If the signal isn't one expected by the receiver, then it might be distorted. Let us know if you have more info.
[04:41:34] <johncc3> Narrow band FM (though in 'Wide' mode). The signal is an FSK signal, but I suspect it is a special mode of FSK
[04:42:09] <johncc3> But it's difficult to identify if I can't record the amplitude info.
[04:44:22] <johncc3> Even at the intro (sync period), about 20% is outside the .wav's range. When there is modulation, saturation occurs on positive and negative excursions.
[04:44:23] <willcode4[m]> It looks like the receiver gets wired directly to the recorder, so the signal has to be "compliant". You can try adjusting the "max dev" and "tau" in the options (... next to the Mode pulldown). Larger "max dev" will give you lower audio.
[04:45:29] <johncc3> Clicking on the '...' button, nothing happens.
[04:45:45] <willcode4[m]> "wide" refers to the filter, and doesn't affect the demod.

[04:46:58] <willcode4[m]> Don't know. When I hit ... I see this.
[04:47:11] <willcode4[m]> In Narrow FM mode.
[04:49:36] <johncc3> Ahhh... Who guesses that? Great. Now the recorded signal is about 50% of full range.
[04:49:44] <johncc3> Tau is pre-emphasis?
[04:51:17] <johncc3> If so, and there is data present, I should probably set Tau to zero?
[04:53:59] <willcode4[m]> Sounds right.
[04:55:31] <willcode4[m]> <johncc3> "Ahhh... Who guesses that? Great...." <- I usually can't help hitting every button on the screen to see what it does üòÄ

[04:56:55] <johncc3> Just a suggestion, wouldn't it be more logical that the '...' would work on all filter widths? I also experiment a lot with the buttons, didn't try this though ;)

[04:57:58] <johncc3> It'd be nice to have this documented. I'll send a suggestion to the gqrx Google Group.
[04:59:05] <willcode4[m]> Is the menu somehow tied to filter width?
[04:59:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> willcode4: OMG. That was YOU!!!!?????  We spent YEARS looking for the root cause of the cross-dimensional space-time rift, and it was YOU all along.  Damn!
[04:59:37] <johncc3> Still, I'd have suspected that in the 'Wide' setting, the signal be in range, as it falls completely inside the bandwidth on screen.
[05:02:20] *** Joins: Macuser (~Macuser@216.30.159.201)
[05:02:31] <willcode4[m]> Wide doesn't affect the expected deviation, it just allows a wider bandwidth info the demod. It could be helpful if they tracked somehow by default.
[05:03:16] <johncc3> willcode4[m], I thought the BW/Tau only appeared when in 'Normal' NBFM mode. Was wrong... or did something wrong.
[05:04:31] <johncc3> I understand about the BW/deviation thing. Itching to try the newly recorded sigs :)
[05:04:59] <willcode4[m]> It appears only for Narrow FM, but is not dependent on the filter. Guessing the window popped up and got covered by something else.
[05:05:04] <willcode4[m]> Have fun!
