[00:09:50] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @Hotness most 'build a bear' stuff is just modular systems like the AR here, hence why it's so popular... though, the AR platform wasn't popular at all until the AWB in the 90s

[00:10:35] <sd> 11<H​otmess> honesly the AR populairty is due to it being the civ version of the mil main issue rifle (or a clone of it)

[23:21:38] <Jaelae> only thing that sucks is they now have fiber service but not in my area yet. 1gb down 1gb up for $49.99. its actually 74.50 because equipment fee and taxes
