[00:42:54] <DPA> It says the container is already not running anymore, though. So something (the cgroup?) probably already killed it, and what made the bot crash was it not handling killing a container that's already dead to fail.
[00:43:06] <Maxdamantus> Hmm.. or maybe cgroups don't have process limits, so maybe it just relies on regular ulimit, in which case the same limit probably applies to multiple containers as it's likely they're running under the same user.

[00:43:53] <Maxdamantus> I think that was just a fluke. I've seen it doing that randomly in response to something else. Might have been caused by the previous command using too much memory.

[02:47:25] <blueagain> ljharb: what's wrong with mongo?
[02:47:41] <ljharb> !no mongo @ blueagain
[02:47:42] <jellobot> blueagain, Don't use MongoDB - it has many issues, and is essentially never the right solution to your problem. Here's a list of issues: http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2015/07/19/why-you-should-never-ever-ever-use-mongodb/ and a more technical article at http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/
[02:48:38] <blueagain> so better to use couchdb?
[02:49:58] <ljharb> lol, i wouldn't say that
[02:50:01] <ljharb> mysql or postgres.
[02:50:59] <wez> s/mysql or //
[02:51:14] <blueagain> so document stores are bad?
[02:51:38] <blueagain> because my framework is pretty relational as it were
[02:51:49] <blueagain> so i've been probably brainwashed to wrap that around mongo
[02:51:59] <ljharb> i mean, postgres is a better JSON document store than mongo or couch
[02:52:08] <ljharb> in general, having schemaless data is something i'd say is bad :-)

[02:52:48] <wez> Yeah, postgresql is a good all rounder.  It doesn't have native TTL support but a simple trigger can implement the behaviour
[02:53:20] <wez> blueagain: What plugin would you write ?
[02:53:42] <blueagain> for my framework, I write store plugins
[02:54:10] <blueagain> so far I have mongo, json and file stores, I mostly use the mongo one myself
[02:54:47] <wez> which framework requires a plugin?

[03:08:03] <codebam> is there a way to select a random index from an array without indexing using .length and Math.random()?
[03:08:04] <xisop> having NIH syndrome for the purpose of challenging yourself and/or academia is completely fine. Though there are techincal debts to doing this in a production environment. Mainly the fact that newer devs won't be familiar with it. Choosing something that's widely adopted has the benefit of allowing newer devs the opportunity to hit the ground running (potentially)
[03:08:27] <ljharb> manjaro-user: you need to auth with nickserv for non-ops to see what you say; see the last link in the topic

[03:08:52] <codebam> okay
[03:09:03] <ljharb> xisop: it's fine as long as you don't forget that outside of "learning", it's a horrifically bad idea

[03:10:12] <blueagain> I don't really care about NIH. I've recently noticed I should probably allow for integration with different front-end frameworks in the future, so I plan to make it a bit modular there. such that you wouldn't have to use web components and could use react instead
[03:10:22] <xisop> so my reason for reinventing stuff was simply for the sake of learning. there is a certain amount of "oh crap" when you have to do something like coding on a system with the limitation of not being able to use a library (which, oddly, is something i've seen companies do)
[03:11:03] <manjaro-user> https://pastebin.com/Gnpc5svr
[03:11:05] <manjaro-user> I did a range request, 0-1024, and the result gives me a length of 1004.
[03:11:09] <xisop> i once applied to a job where they said you could not use the internet when coding. nor could you use any libraries. it was for a super strict financial institution
[03:11:20] <manjaro-user> Am I using the wrong container or something?
[03:11:37] <mikrosis> why not use megaNextJS2022? It does everything when you exactly fit their use case - otherwise you can change 10000 files and transpile everything 8)
[03:12:02] <ljharb> xisop: all that policy means is they are 100% guaranteed to be compromised
[03:12:19] <ljharb> xisop: you can't have security in a practical sense if you're not leveraging ecosystem expertise
[03:12:27] <xisop> ljharb: i don't think that was their intention when air-gapping the codebase
[03:12:47] <ljharb> xisop: of course it wasn't. it's just somebody who wrongly thought that it'll be secure if there's no internet in it
[03:12:53] <ljharb> xisop: but that's not how security works

[07:05:51] <ljharb> Adventure369: ok so all the UI states you should be testing
[07:05:59] <ljharb> Adventure369: the CSS stuff is a bit different
[07:06:10] *** Quits: c4017w__ (~c4017@209.52.68.8) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[07:06:51] <Adventure369> the UI states depend on CSS though... basically if you pass in prop disabled or prop loading string into the button I created an if else statement to include certain classes to the buttons styling

[07:07:35] <ljharb> you can test for class names, but class names aren't the best way to style components, css-in-js is
[07:07:38] <ljharb> but that's a whole different thing
[07:07:44] <ljharb> for now, just test that the right class names are there

[07:08:13] <systemfault> ljharb: What css-in-js lib are the cool kids using these days?
[07:08:25] <systemfault> (been out of the frontend world for a while now...)
[07:08:53] <ljharb> no idea, but i don't like lots of the ones i've seen
[07:09:03] <ljharb> it's just a far simpler approach, is all
[07:09:04] <Adventure369> so I'm only testing if the button is default, disabled or loading (those are the values that can be inserted into the type prop)?
[07:09:11] <Adventure369> I can ignore unit testing the rest of the props ?
[07:09:53] <systemfault> Adventure369: Each of those states should add/remove a class on your button
[07:10:07] <Adventure369> They do systemfault
[07:10:11] <theskillwithin> systemfault styled-components is probably the most popular, emotionjs is good as well,  but then theres also https://linaria.dev/ which is awesome.
[07:10:59] <systemfault> theskillwithin: Style-components is the only one I've ever used... then I heard of other libs like emotion

[07:11:11] <systemfault> (Had never heard of Linaria)
[07:11:39] <Adventure369> sorry I explained it wrong... I have two props one called type and one called state ... the type accepts 3 values... primary, secondary and tertiary... (these correspond to a class that has specific styling for each)... then I have another prop called state that handles the default, disabled and loading.
[07:12:10] <Adventure369> Would I need to create unit tests for both props?
[07:12:44] <Adventure369> the primary secondary and tertiary only change the buttons color... and the type state handles the cursor pointer, loading/disabled effects... hover... etc
[07:12:45] <theskillwithin> on new projects in nextjs, i use styled-components, because nextjs is supporting styled-components for its SWR build.  but ya idk that metric is just best build time I guess, so im not sure if Im making the right choice, but thats life.
[07:13:04] <systemfault> Yes. But since there's no logic, only styling, you only have 6 tests (3 + 3)... not 9 (3 * 3)
[07:13:34] <systemfault> You only check if the classes were properly set in every case.

[07:28:45] <systemfault> Hehe, I'm really rusty
[07:29:11] <Adventure369> NP thank you
[07:29:29] <deltab> I'd use switch for that, as there's more than two possible values
[07:30:27] <Adventure369> would you expect a junior dev to know that?
[07:30:59] <Adventure369> just wondering
[07:32:48] <Adventure369> like how bad is it the way I did it?
[07:33:30] <deltab> about my preference, or about the existence of switch statements?
[07:34:34] <Adventure369> about your preference.... is it preference? or is it something that I should have been able to see?
[07:34:39] <Adventure369> I don't usually use switch statements
[07:34:39] <systemfault> Adventure369: Something like... https://codesandbox.io/s/nifty-swartz-b5ihj7?file=/src/App.js
[07:34:45] <Adventure369> I always use if else
[07:34:47] <Adventure369> for conditionals
[07:34:54] <Adventure369> how would I know when to use which ?
[07:35:19] <systemfault> In my testcase, I only add the classes.. nothing else
[07:35:28] <systemfault> Then I do the "ifs" in my CSS
[07:35:57] <Adventure369> Didn't even know you could do IF's in CSS
[07:36:19] <deltab> in one way, it's a whole sequence of ifs
[07:36:52] <deltab> if (selector matches) { apply properties }
[07:37:05] <systemfault> They're not really "ifs", it acts more like a state machine
[07:38:11] <systemfault> Adventure369: So, the idea is... if you have a component like that, without logic... you only have to test if the class names are properly adding, not even their combinations

[16:45:11] <wyclif> I think because you don't have any programming job experience, you should just list your previous employment even if it was in a different industry. That's what I did when I was getting started.

[17:08:26] <blueagain> if he discloses it, he gets turned down, if he hides it, it might come up in the background check and he's also screwed
[17:09:03] <ox1eef> that's definitely a downside, and i think with just a name you can look up criminal history in the US? is that a thing?
[17:09:31] <wyclif> Never list a skill or a technology that you don't know well. Less is more. Because if you list a technology/language/framework that you've only played with, it's fair game for the interviewer to explore the depth of your knowledge in that specific technology
[17:10:10] <blueagain> ox1eef: that's my understanding of it. I told him to not disclose it as it's nobody's business, and he said it would most likely come up in the background check anyway, since they tap government records and what not
[17:10:11] <theskillwithin> blueagain meh, i dropped out of community college and I have 2 dui's.  all anyone cares about is can you do the work
[17:10:21] <Intelo> Question: Would anyone like to tell his/her favourite programming language and why?
[17:10:53] <blueagain> theskillwithin: you'd be surprised how much some people care for compliance

[17:11:01] <ox1eef> blueagain: that at least requires consent though, right? i have memories of ppl finding out court dates and other stuff with just a name
[17:11:03] <wyclif> So I'd advise to only list technologies that you can go deep with
[17:11:17] <wyclif> It also makes the interview a lot more pleasant

[17:11:51] <theskillwithin> blueagain those kinda places require you to dress up, and im not about that
[17:11:57] <blueagain> only the name-changing authority knows
[17:12:16] <wyclif> theskillwithin: some of the best programmers I know are not university grads and some of the best ones that did go to college didn't study Comp Sci
[17:12:31] <blueagain> theskillwithin: true
[17:12:53] <blueagain> but I do think that as a general rule, europeans care more about degrees and official stuff than actual experience
[17:12:57] <ox1eef> if God blesses you with wealth, let it be seen on you ;)
[17:12:59] <Rockwood> anyway enough
[17:13:09] <Rockwood> i think looks better to me
[17:13:20] <Rockwood> https://dpaste.com/9H4PTS32C
[17:13:34] <ox1eef> blueagain: absolutely, theyre more rigid and peculiar to process. the us is much better.
[17:14:28] <farn> Rockwood: If you mention it, it should be "Hooks", not "Hook". Though I think people will be more interested in seeing _any_ code you've written that uses React
[17:14:35] <blueagain> there's up and downs. it's much harder to fire anyone here. if you've made it through probation, they basically can't fire you
[17:15:00] <Rockwood> farn, i attached my github like in it
[17:15:11] <ox1eef> my experience is that the us really is a land of opportunity, ive worked for us companies close to a decade, and i doubt i ever would have been given a chance in europe.
[17:15:15] <wyclif> blueagain: That's also why Euro corporations are slower to hire
[17:15:21] <wyclif> Like in Germany
[17:15:48] <theskillwithin> so i get to babysit a junior dev thats impossible to fire; cuz to fire the process takes over a year
[17:15:52] <blueagain> wyclif: sure, but that really hinders innovation. as a company, you might be stuck with a lot of people who aren't doing much, and it hinders young blood from entering the org
[17:16:03] <wyclif> There's a certain high admin and institutional overhead to employees in Europe. There's no "hire fast, fire fast" like in the States
[17:16:09] <blueagain> yup
[17:16:46] <blueagain> there was a guy at one place I was working, he was doing nothing all day but surfing ebay, and he wasn't even making an effort to hide it
[17:16:47] <ox1eef> not only that, theyre hung up on uni degrees - if you dont have one, they wont even look at you. that doesnt happen int he us.
[17:16:54] <Rockwood> farn, https://github.com/Cyberiaaxis/Rockwood/blob/master/resources/js/components/Login.js
[17:18:40] <wyclif> Full disclosure: I studied Medieval Literature at uni. I hung out a lot in the Comp Sci labs to have access to the Sun workstations, but I never took a single Comp Sci class, I'm completely self-taught
[17:19:35] <blueagain> wyclif: I was completely self-taught until 25 when I entered uni. I can't say uni has given me much other than an easier entry ticket to a job here in the .eu
[17:19:36] <theskillwithin> wyclif is morals and dogma included in that?
[17:20:03] <theskillwithin> albert pike
[17:20:06] <theskillwithin> i think
[17:20:08] <blueagain> I did learn a few interesting things and the math courses were awesome, but I don't think it should be a requirement

[17:24:59] <stenno> MAN
[17:25:04] <stenno> those are the german ones
[17:25:07] <blueagain> because you don't use SAP in your everyday life

[17:26:24] <ox1eef> it is still rubbish, there is big companies in europe - yes, but could steve jobs get a job there? or bill gates? no, because they wouldnt be given a chance. you have to go through school, ace your exams, go to uni, and THEN you have a chance. otherwise you dont. europe clearly sucks here.
[17:26:48] <farn> Rockwood: Fair enough. When I saw that README.md that only talks about Laravel, I wasn't sure which parts of the code were actually written by you. I'd probably replace that file with a description of what this game is about, and what technologies it uses
[17:27:06] <stenno> in IT, if you have a good idea, you can make a company here as well
[17:27:07] <farn> Rockwood: I'd also set the default branch to master on GitHub so that you don't have to link to `/tree/master`

[17:31:25] <wyclif> I used to think the Swedes were also great at automotive engineering. But then Volvo got sold to Ford and sadly, Saab went bankrupt

[17:33:20] <stenno> and they are all american, given
[17:33:37] <blueagain> even wikipedia comes from the us
[17:33:39] <stenno> is that because steve jobs was given opportunities he wouldn't have had in germany? i doubt it
[17:34:34] <stenno> if you said, 'in medicine in germany, its very difficult to have a cross-start', then i would have agreed
[17:34:45] <wyclif> stenno: when I tell people "I never took a CompSci course" I have to add some context so they don't get the wrong idea. I'm self-taught, but I did read a lot of the same books that are assigned in CompSci, like the standard Data Structures & Algorithms and Operating Systems material
[17:34:48] <stenno> but in IT specifically, its very difficult
[17:34:59] <stenno> different

[17:36:16] <blueagain> I've never met a person in my life who used SAP because he wanted to.
[17:36:23] <wez> stenno: That's a very personal and out of topic question to ask here
[17:36:31] <Intelo> Question: is there any.. ANY UI lib/strategy/language/framework that is simply better and fast to develop as compared to html,css , js websites. I am thinking to use native UI in wasm instead of react/ js. It will still be a website.
[17:36:32] <stenno> oh you are right
[17:36:36] <wez> :)
[17:36:40] <wyclif> Volkswagon translates to "car of the people"

[17:40:18] <theskillwithin> i wasn't making an argument... jesus dude
[17:40:18] <wez> stenno: Slavery is still on-going, ironically Africa is one of the worst places for it.
[17:40:21] <blueagain> also, energy prices here in .de are horrible because we were dumb and shut down our nuclear power plants

[17:45:23] <farn> Rockwood: I'm not sure how that helps someone who finds that project, via your resume or otherwise
[17:45:26] <blueagain> oO
[17:45:50] <stenno> 'volkswagen is a high tech company' 'didnt hitler drive volkswagen?'
[17:45:54] <stenno> what kind of funny joke is that
[17:46:35] <stenno> did you think that would add anything of value or fucking what
[17:46:58] <blueagain> relax stenno, I don't think they were meaning it literally
[17:47:00] <stenno> unlike americans, we take our past serious
[17:47:10] <stenno> blueagain: that is what i am saying
[17:47:47] <farn> Rockwood: I also think that all that stuff about Laravel doesn't help them either. I think the file should contain the name of your game, a short description of what it's (going to be) about, and then you can mention the technologies it uses, e.g. that the React frontend is in `resources/js/` to help people find your code
[17:48:01] <wyclif> Anyway, if I seem opinionated about the resume stuff, it's only because I recently revised mine. And for the first time I had a pro re-do mine. I thought I knew everything there was to know about resume writing, but he pointed out a number of things I was doing wrong and corrected them. One of them was that my old resume was too fancy. I had two colours and a stylish format. He advised me to ditch the
[17:48:07] <wyclif> fancy formatting and go with a simple, black-on-white one centered column style and simplified the format.
[17:49:09] <wyclif> Another pro tip I learned was to quantify what you did in previous roles with numbers (not everybody has that data available, but if you do, use it)
[17:49:27] <Rockwood> farn, i don't want disclose the name of app right now
[17:49:52] <wyclif> For instance, instead of "Improved throughput to CI pipelines" you should say "Improved throughput by 30%"

[21:44:49] <Intelo> stenno children can also be made but I am not sure with attributes but I am not sure. Can they be?
[21:44:54] <stenno> react is just javascript, so technically you can do everything in webcomponents
[21:45:01] <stenno> that you can also do in react
[21:46:23] <Intelo> I see.
[21:46:25] <Intelo> I just watch a whole lot of videos on "html web components shadow dom custom element html templates ".  Few questions:  how to manage state, how to auto change UI in response to ajax call or data changed due to user interaction. No central kind of store/ state? also state is immutable in frameworks like react etc,  concept of virtual dom for
[21:46:26] <Intelo> performance (update only whats needed to be updated), b) How to avoid boiler plate code on each component c) Is there a way to get the html of custom tag from an .html file and not from `<div>template strings</div>`.

[21:48:17] <Intelo> I mean, are there ways that I am unaware of

[21:48:33] <Intelo> those are class based. yes. is that what you mean?

[21:49:13] <stenno> so its kinda silly to think of web components as something comparable to react components
[21:49:41] <EdFletcher> the vdom is one of the biggest benefits and novel implementation details you get with react

[22:02:13] <EdFletcher> blueagain: excellent choices!
[22:02:30] <stenno> Intelo: weren't your questions already answered several times though
[22:02:39] <stenno> Intelo: i have the feeling that you are constantly asking the same thing
[22:02:56] <thumbs> stenno: that is what they do in a nutshell
[22:03:02] <Intelo> stenno i am still discussing and exchanging ideas. Thank you
[22:03:15] <jr_web_dev> i have 2 array of objects. they are identical in terms of properties but values vary.. i want to copy a few nested properties from one array of obj to another where template = a... i only know how to do this using 2 for each loops and using if conditions.. is there a better way?
[22:03:20] <farn> Intelo: I haven't seen how they'd give me declarative rendering, so I don't see how they replace any of the previously mentioned frameworks for me personally
[22:03:28] <stenno> thumbs: :|
[22:03:30] <stenno> noted
[22:03:39] <Intelo> stenno so is farn. with me (or anyone else may join)

[22:07:37] <jr_web_dev> thanks.. but its not really a database.. its a redux store i created but regardless.. i still want to acquire this skill.. how does one properly copy a subset of properties to another array of objects based off a condition.. without using two for each loops

[22:10:00] <Intelo> and one , or anyone can ask same question several times if he has confusions, or didn't understand or have different perspectives. or have more things to talk about... why the enforced behaviour? no offense though.
[22:10:10] <Intelo> stenno it is still a conversation by definition
[22:10:13] <farn> Intelo: I don't know. I don't really use Web Components unless a library happens to give me one
[22:10:19] <jr_web_dev> blueagain: but yeah its not a database i have.. id still want to know how to be able to do that.. be in the future if i have this issue in mongodb then ill use mongodbs manner of doing it
[22:10:24] <EdFletcher> Intelo: stenno is not wrong, i could query literally years of logs of you coming into channels asking the same thing over and over, often cross-posting (which is terrible etiquette). classic help vampire behavior.
[22:10:38] <blueagain> jr_web_dev: if you're doing an m to n, you're eventually going to iterate over both arrays in some form. what I'm saying is that what you're doing is a probably much better task for a database, which actually offers you a language to query data and another language to project it

[22:12:26] <jr_web_dev> blueagain: ha, okay i didnt know sql understood json or javascript objects aka dictionaries..
[22:12:40] <stenno> mentioning stuff like that is not 'enforcing ones opinion'
[22:12:49] <blueagain> jr_web_dev: some sql flavours can work with json, I know oracle's can
[22:12:54] <stenno> EdFletcher has every right to point stuff like that out, regardless of if they are an op or not

[22:14:46] <stenno> pg is quite good regarding json stuff
[22:14:51] <stenno> they have json datatypes
[22:14:58] <jr_web_dev> ha Interesting thumbs and blueagain ... im going to be using a database soon.. was thinking of using mongodb.. but people say they recommnd a sql rdbms system instead.. ill have to do login's and stuff like that

[22:15:35] <jr_web_dev> maybe ill structure it in one way and then have it spit out in json some how ... thanks blueagain ..
[22:15:40] <thumbs> jr_web_dev: mongodb sounds ill-suited for that purpose, but I disgress
[22:15:53] <blueagain> stenno: nice, with nifty operators
[22:15:54] <stenno> mongodb is ill-suited for any purpose

[22:17:01] <stenno> !no mongo @ jr_web_dev
[22:17:01] <jellobot> jr_web_dev, Don't use MongoDB - it has many issues, and is essentially never the right solution to your problem. Here's a list of issues: http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2015/07/19/why-you-should-never-ever-ever-use-mongodb/ and a more technical article at http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/

[22:17:56] <wyclif> stenno | I'm afraid you triggered me with that mention of MongoDB. I'll probably need a gin and tonic to recover
[22:18:04] <jr_web_dev> you see there u go!.. okay ill have to learn to just use mysql or postgres... so technically how does one convert there javascript object and store it in rdbms
[22:18:18] <jr_web_dev> whats the best practice
[22:18:35] <thumbs> jr_web_dev: it depends on what you need to do with them
