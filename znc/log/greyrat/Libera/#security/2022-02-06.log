[01:23:02] <zdctg[m]> raubot: i think because in practice most software used wouldn't pass formal verification, I mean they use threads and all sorts of constructs that make it a very difficult process because execution isn't deterministic and then also because most of the software doesn't really need it. I don't think this other guy understands what you mean by formal verification.
[01:25:14] <zdctg[m]> For the things where it does matter and you do want that type of certainty, e.g. boats, planes and automobiles-- it generally is, although automobiles maybe not so much anymore although they traditionally isolated the car components bus from that can plausibly get hacked

[01:26:50] <raubot> yeah, i was thinking of bugs that caused numerous deaths (like plan crashes) or huge lossses (pipelines), i think it's weird that the software for those systems has bugs
[01:26:57] <Apachez> raubot: google on common criteria
[01:27:12] <raubot> is it really cheaper to not use formal verification and deal with those deaths/losses?
[01:27:33] <AlwaysRight> In an interviewer, my trainer explained that you can detect a rootkit by mounting it to a networked NAS. The idea is that it's no longer hid in the Registry. But, if you did a bit-for-bit registry, the Registry would still be included. Does anyone know how this would work or have any thoughts on it?
[01:27:48] <AlwaysRight> *bit-for-bit copy
[01:28:31] <zdctg[m]> raubot: i think generally speaking that formal verification is used in those circumstances, or at least everywhere ive ever had knowledge of such a system. I think also generally speaking that when such things do occur its frequently some other issue not related to a software bug.

[01:30:32] <zdctg[m]> AlwaysRight: I'm not 100% positive about the logic, but its very common for people to remove the potentially compromised system from the equation so they can inspect the underlying data. Consider a rootkit that is hiding some file, the way it hides the file is by altering the OS so that it doesn't appear (generally speaking), so if you view the file system on a system that isn't compromised and isn't patched to hide the file, then the file
[01:30:32] <zdctg[m]> appears-- if what you're saying is correct it sounds like that would be the logic

[01:31:10] <AlwaysRight> Yeah - that makes sense. But if you copy the Registry as well, I'm thinking it could still hide.

[01:32:53] <zdctg[m]> AlwaysRight: well it could modify the registry hive as you copy it or similar, if I understood what the interviewer was getting at then the assumption would be that it wasn't doing that. It's a little weird to mention specifically a NAS though which is why I'm not positive that is what they meant, but I haven't the foggiest idea what they could mean with that either
[01:33:29] <AlwaysRight> ... Because the NAS would show the system calls to the API
[01:33:57] <AlwaysRight> ... And, now that I'm thinking about it, that might explain it right there! If the other network programs aren't running, the rootkit communication would be isolated.
[01:33:59] <zdctg[m]> is there some other meaning for the acronym other than network attached storage that I'm aware of?
[01:34:01] <AlwaysRight> I think that's it!
[01:34:42] <AlwaysRight> The process is no longer concealed. And, zdctg[m], I agree with you on the interviwer. I'm not happy with the job where he trained me. I have multiple doubts about him.
[01:34:45] <zdctg[m]> as you framed it, that sounds right to me-- thats pretty standard forensics that you don't do the examination from the compromised host itself
[01:35:06] <AlwaysRight> Well, you also can't do it from the compromised host because it breaks the chain of custody
[01:35:27] <AlwaysRight> ... If you start working on live images on the infected host, the defense will claim you tainted the evidence
[01:35:49] <AlwaysRight> (The job in question is a forensic job)
[01:36:32] <zdctg[m]> well i dont think it would break chain of custody really, i mean the custody of who has it hasn't changed, but unless you used a write blocker or similar then you might modify the disk which would potentially totally screw up the case unless you could absolutely 100% prove that whatever you changed didn't impact anything and even then you'd still be leaving it for a jury to decide
[01:37:13] *** Quits: machinedgod (~machinedg@24.105.81.50) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:37:18] <zdctg[m]> but even outside of legalities, the main reason you wouldn't want to use the compromised host is because the host is potentially hiding stuff from you, so you use your own known good computer and examine the drive/whatever from there
[01:37:48] <zdctg[m]> or at least thats how i learned things when i did forensics work back in the stone ages
[01:39:09] <AlwaysRight> I just know that when I thought about copying the disk while it was a live image, my trainer got upset.
[01:39:51] <AlwaysRight> They were very much of the idea that there's a very speciifc, exact way to do things and any deviation is unacceptable
[01:40:40] <zdctg[m]> that's going to be a byproduct of legalities for the most part-- there is a standard, its proven to be correct and that process was followed exclusively, then lawyers don't have any wiggle room really unless they can find something wrong with the process
[01:41:42] <zdctg[m]> I used to work for the government in a totally unrelated way, but because I didn't have a clearance I had to sit in a different building than everyone else and I ended up sitting in a cybercrime task force's headquarters and got some familiarity with how they do things-- it at least used to be that the FBI had very strict standards about how things were done and what tools could be used
[01:42:12] <zdctg[m]> you had to use a write blocker and you had to use dd and you had to do things in a particular manner, once you had done that you could do whatever you wanted, but you always had to loop back and make it conform to whatever their processes were
[01:42:20] <AlwaysRight> Yeah, they were on the verge of clearing me
[01:42:59] <zdctg[m]> so for instance they weren't allowed to use encase for any of their reporting, but after they acquired an image and such they'd often use it to find whatever they were looking for and then mold it back to their standards

[02:03:42] <zdctg[m]> well i think part of the problem was trying to formally verify a library without any context; this is a subject well outside my expertise, but my understanding is that you'd generally verify that such a circumstance never occurs and therefore strcpy is fine and the program always executes as expected-- but the problem is that most modern software processes make it more or less impossible to do that, e.g. threading changes things a lot and

[02:16:17] <Apachez> most are included in the linux cve's

[14:04:20] <godSend23> like i get notified if there's a person/animal in the vicinity capture by the view of the camera
[14:04:44] <godSend23> as quickly as possible if i don't have my phone on me
[14:05:38] <Apachez> again most have motion detection
[14:05:44] <Apachez> not necessary to identify what the motion is due to
[14:05:51] <Apachez> like car, animal, person, ghost etc
[14:05:55] <godSend23> right ok
[14:06:08] <Apachez> https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056987954-UniFi-Protect-Manage-motion-detection-and-privacy-zones
[14:06:26] <godSend23> which system/ preferably open source do u recommend that ties in to any discrete spy camera sys?
[14:06:49] <godSend23> ty for link
[14:07:38] <Apachez> I havent dug in the opensource market for this
[14:07:43] <Apachez> but its all software based
[14:08:01] <Apachez> so you could use any shitty low priced camera for this since the logic is in the device that the camera streams to
[14:08:28] <Apachez> things to watch out for in the price range is noise levels and picture quality in dark/night mode
[14:08:41] <Apachez> noise levels since you dont want to have false positives
[14:08:53] <Apachez> and picture quality - well I want to see details if I use a security camera
[14:08:56] <Apachez> depends also on purpose
[14:09:00] <godSend23> " logic is in the device that the camera streams to" ... not UniFi itself?
[14:09:09] <Apachez> perhaps you just care if somebody is on location not necessary be able to identify who that is
[14:09:12] <Apachez> or what it is :P
[14:09:28] <Apachez> godSend23: the camera streams to the videobox who does the logic
[14:09:38] <Apachez> more expensive cameras have onboard computing power
[14:09:47] <Apachez> but those goes beyond the $1000 range
[14:10:02] <godSend23> i need something that can run on battery and portable and can be removed quickly

[14:16:17] <Apachez> but if you want to do picture/video analysis in the range of 300feet+ then you must accept to have a large wallet and have a centralized processing of the video feeds... also using poe to be more resilent

[14:20:09] <Apachez> Im a bit sceptic of their dark/night modes
[14:20:56] <godSend23> of course; batman worthy stuff here hopefully
[14:21:41] <Apachez> also the pictures are hilarious
[14:21:54] <Apachez> on one its like if the camera is just slightly larger than the tip of your finger
[14:22:09] <Apachez> then in the videos you can clearly see that its the size of an enalrged golf ball
[14:22:17] <Apachez> half way to become a tennis ball :P
[14:22:24] <Apachez> like a golf ball after xmas and thanksgiving ;)

[14:37:49] <zdctg[m]> usually when they say something like that-- camera is the size of $xyz; what they mean is the sensor itself is that big, but that doesn't necessarily include any sort of controller, wifi adapter, USB controller and so on which basically makes up the entire PCB that the sensor is attached to. It's misleading to some extent, but you're confusing "camera" to mean the entire thing when they mean strictly the sensor itself
[14:38:15] <zdctg[m]> Oh I guess I should look at the pictures, nevermind me
