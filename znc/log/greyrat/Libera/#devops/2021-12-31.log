[00:19:40] <rawtaz> lantech19446:  for a quick fix, consider using the dns servers listed under the setup guide for OpenDNS Family Shield  at https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/
[00:20:04] <rawtaz> i tried it today and it successfully blocked pornhub.com and youporn.com
[00:23:10] <lantech19446> rawtaz: that's precisely what I was going to do I was just going to use pihole to facilitate it. For some reason it seemed to work better when I used to do that
[00:23:58] <rawtaz> are you saying you tried both this service and pihole?
[00:25:16] <lantech19446> pihole has opendns family shield built in you enable it and configure it all from pihole and then the pihole sits in front of your modem and does its thing with everything going into or out of the network it seems to work better than just doing opendns as a dns forwarder
[00:25:45] <rawtaz> ok
[00:26:04] <rawtaz> i thought pihole was just a dns hole/server
[00:27:06] <lantech19446> it's also an ad blocker and i think it does some other stuff with extensions too it's just is it worth it to me to do this and then get rid of it in a couple months
[00:28:04] <rawtaz> ok
[00:33:19] <slaughter> <lantech19446> it's also an ad blocker -> not really, it's still just blocking the DNS of the ad itself
[00:34:44] <lantech19446> slaughter: that's like their advertised reason for being even if they aren't particularly good at it
[00:35:33] <slaughter> pihole is great at it, you just need more/better lists
[00:36:30] <lantech19446> for my use case I don't really need the ad blocking at all I just need the abilities to incorporate opendns but like I was saying to rawtaz I don't know if it's worth building it and then ripping it all out in a couple months
[00:36:35] <slaughter> By default it doesn't catch a ton of stuff, but with a list or two it's great
[00:36:43] <slaughter> Ah you should be running pihole on your home network :)
[00:37:19] <lantech19446> I don't have any extra boxes to run it on I don't even have a homelab no money for one
[00:38:01] <slaughter> It's incredibly easy to "build" and just as easy to remove later, I wouldn't worry about that too much
[00:38:13] <slaughter> Ah dang, get ya a pi and go to town on docker
[00:38:21] <rawtaz> lantech19446: opendns is just a dns setting away, why not start with that
[00:39:07] <slaughter> build: docker run, setup: change pihole settings as appropriate then change your network's DNS to the pihole, teardown: change your network's DNS back, kill the pihole container
[00:39:37] <slaughter> rawtaz I bet he needs audit logs
[00:39:48] <lantech19446> nope
[00:40:36] <slaughter> Oh, then why not just change the DNS for now and call it good?
[00:40:39] <lantech19446> if an auditor comes out they want to see that we've had a public meeting concerning the implementation of a filter that was advertised prior to the meeting and then they choose a node or three and try going to illicit sites
[00:41:29] <lantech19446> the last time I tried opendns it sucked as a dns forwarder
[00:41:42] <rawtaz> in what ways?
[00:41:49] <lantech19446> it missed tons of shit
[00:42:06] <rawtaz> are you saying that it failed to resolve legitimate FQDNs?
[00:42:55] <lantech19446> that and it failed to block really blatant pornagraphic websites like xhamster and motherless
[00:43:04] <rawtaz> haha
[00:43:08] <rawtaz> xhamster
[00:43:26] <lantech19446> i kinda understood why it missed alt . com
[00:48:47] <rawtaz> a bit old but https://hackernoon.com/porn-filters-compared-opendns-neustar-cleanbrowsing-norton-yandex-and-adguard-41f207062c4 says cleanbrowsing was the best for porn blocking
[00:49:10] <rawtaz> they even have a specific page about CIPA: https://cleanbrowsing.org/cipa/
[00:50:09] <lantech19446> never heard of cleanbrowsing we used k9 web protection it was a paid service but was endpoint specific and also had behavior based blocking and image blocking it was phenomenal
[00:51:02] *** Quits: dingdreher (~dingdrehe@46.140.25.62) (Quit: dingdreher)
[00:58:08] <lantech19446> they keep mentioning a free version but i don't see it anywhere on their site
[00:58:30] <rawtaz> fotter, "Configure free" or something
[00:58:41] <rawtaz> footer*
[00:58:43] <rawtaz> to the right
[01:02:38] <rawtaz> i might try running the at a customer, with the Security list
[01:03:21] <lantech19446> ok, might just break their license for a few days and see if it's worth it I don't trust companies that don't do trials as a general rule
[01:04:06] <rawtaz> is it not free for schools?
[01:04:18] <lantech19446> nope
[01:04:41] <lantech19446> it's not free for families schools libraries businesses I'm not sure who the free version even applies too
[01:06:01] <lantech19446> oh their freemode is literally just 3 filters you can use as dns forwarders with no config options
[01:06:10] <rawtaz> yeah
[01:06:30] <rawtaz> you could simply try that filter's dns on your local machine to see how well it works
[01:06:39] <rawtaz> and youll get a lot more work done at the same time ;)
[01:07:59] <lantech19446> wow it actually blocks alt.com
[01:08:11] <rawtaz> now i have to check what the heck that is
[01:08:20] <lantech19446> it's a dating site for bdsm
[01:08:25] <rawtaz> oh
[01:08:26] <rawtaz> lame.
[01:09:06] <lantech19446> yea it's also a paid service but there used to be lots and lots of girls taking "pictures" on it so even though it was a dating site it needed to be blocked and none of the filters had caught up to that yet
[01:09:40] <rawtaz> right yeah
[01:09:56] <rawtaz> well there might be something to their "filters" being good then
[01:11:25] <lantech19446> yea I'd have to set it up as a dns forwarder though because I need to be able to use local dns still
[01:13:54] <rawtaz> you would probably configure your local dns to use this cleanbroowsing thing as resolvers for things the lloocal onne cant figure  outt itself, esyeah
[01:16:14] <lantech19446> seems to work out well as a forwarder it's still blocking
[01:16:32] <lantech19446> yea that's a good solution
[01:23:26] *** Joins: dingdreher (~dingdrehe@46.140.25.62)
[02:36:34] <lantech19446> so rawtaz I implemented the cleanbrowse it seems to do a decent job. I think I'll build a vm with ubuntu and use that to install docker and see what it's all about
[02:37:20] <rawtaz> confusing. what does ubuntu and docker have to do with it
[02:37:30] <rawtaz> (and ffs install debian instead of ubuntu :P)
[02:37:55] <lantech19446> just as a means to fuck with docker in general that's why I was going to go the pihole route originally

[02:39:37] <rawtaz> ok :)
[02:39:40] <rawtaz> go fuck around
[02:39:42] <rawtaz> thats great
[02:52:57] <lantech19446> actually why am I building this on either one of those when I still have red hat licenses to use up
[03:02:57] *** Quits: murii (~murii@2a02:a58:835a:1100:21a3:bcee:241b:be61) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:11:35] <slaughter> Why are you building a VM to install an OS to test a tool that would run on whatever machine you have in front of you?
[03:18:47] <lantech19446> because I don't particularly want to run on it on this machine directly and I don't have any extra boxes to build it on
[03:24:15] <lantech19446> I guess I really should start saving up to build up a homelab but right now I have to do 90% of my experiments at work
[03:25:26] <rawtaz> better do it there
[03:25:37] <rawtaz> i presume you can set up a VPN so you can access it from home
[03:27:32] <lantech19446> I could but usually I just use one of our unused statics 
[03:31:43] <rawtaz> are we supposed to know what you mean by "statics"?
[03:33:14] <lantech19446> do you guys not have static IPs?
[03:33:25] <lantech19446> usually people in tech do know what i mean when i say that
[03:33:53] <rawtaz> in the sentence and context you used it, i'd argue it didnt make any sense at all
[03:34:36] <rawtaz> no serious person i know would say that. sorry but. it's really just annoying when you come up with ambigous and dffuse terminology like that
[03:35:15] <rawtaz> its just annoying and makes me less talkative since i have to ask for clarification, in which case it makes more sense to just be silent instead :)
[03:40:48] <rawtaz> night be a language barrier. perhaps "statics" is a common english word for "many static <something>"
[03:40:53] <rawtaz> might*
[03:41:33] <lantech19446> it's a pretty common way of saying static IP's even the ISP's around here use it. 
[03:42:36] <rawtaz> ok
[03:42:46] <rawtaz> sad world.
[03:43:48] <lantech19446> There are far more important things to be mad about lol Don't worry I'm sure I'll give you other reasons soon enough
[03:45:17] <lantech19446> one of the things I find in some of the tech rooms I'm in now is that everyone has enterprise experience, I come from a very small network with very little budget the way we do things it's like night and day I'm going to have to learn a completely different culture and habitat when I get into that world
[03:46:07] <rawtaz> youre not alone
[03:47:52] <lantech19446> I'm sure but some people have very little patience for people when they aren't doing something the way they think it should be done. I left the httpd room because of that and at least one other I forget which. It makes me sad to not get along with people and be able to learn from them but sometimes the drama is just amazing
[03:49:31] <rawtaz> let me guess - thumbs
[03:49:44] <lantech19446> yep
[03:51:27] <lantech19446> bracham spent hours helping me one night to get my vhosts working correctly for some odd reason they just weren't working the way they should and we ended up using named vhosts instead. Every time I'd ask for help he'd tell me I have to change it or i can't ask for help. Finally I just left the channel altogether and I've managed to keep things running pretty well without them
[03:52:25] <rawtaz> well theres some limit to how much effort they want to spend. if they spend a few hours and the only way of getting if working for you is that (named vhosts i presume), no wonder they expect that you use that going forward
[03:53:18] <lantech19446> no no thumbs was requiring me to not use the named vhosts he wanted me to do it a different way that didn't even work I had tried that way first
[03:54:27] <rawtaz> right
[03:55:13] <lantech19446> i'm actually still friendly with bracham i'm on his personal server we talk a lot him and brianx and occasionally shadow
[04:00:13] <rawtaz> being friends is good. life is too short to be unfriendly
[04:00:38] <lantech19446> yea
[04:08:51] <lantech19446> do you ever have days where you run out of things to do at work and you're just sitting around for an hour or two like fuck i want to go home
[04:09:19] <rawtaz> not even close
[04:09:22] <rawtaz> i always have shit to do
[04:10:39] <lantech19446> I love days like that like tonight I have nothing to do until I leave in just over an hour and it does nothing but mess with my anxiety level
[04:11:09] <rawtaz> isnt that when you take the time to learn stuff?
[04:11:19] <rawtaz> i dont see why you consider it empty time so to speak
[04:12:07] <lantech19446> that's actually why I decided to start messing with docker right now even though i'm already trying to learn aws and python it's something to do at work so my mind doesn't start messing with me

[05:28:23] <slaughter>  <lantech19446> I could but usually I just use one of our unused statics - I am still befuddled on this in the context of the conversation - you use a static IP at your work, when you're at another location? I'm dumb for sure but that's hurting my brain
[05:29:16] <rawtaz> he probably meant that the server(s) are on static *external* IPs and thereby he can access them directly instead of having to ues a VPN
[05:32:44] <lantech19446> Precisely
[05:33:05] <rawtaz> so in your world saying "statics" means "static external IPs"
[05:33:07] <rawtaz> :>
[05:33:52] <slaughter> Ah ok, so really you just mean you have boxes you can ssh into
[05:34:22] <slaughter> I have never in my life heard such access/concepts described as "use one of our unused statics"
[05:34:39] <slaughter> Makes sense now
[05:50:38] <lantech19446> Maybe it's just a local thing 
[05:50:57] <lantech19446> I thought it was pretty common
[05:59:51] <lantech19446> I just gotta say this is the first year i'm starting without crippling depression interspersed with manic episodes my brain is on literally a new level for me and I'm not sure that either of you realize this but you're part of that, you're helping me to become better at my job and eventually make life better for my family and I really appreciate you two
