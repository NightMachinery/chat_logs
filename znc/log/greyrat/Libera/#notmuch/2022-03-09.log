[03:49:19] <fejj> dkg: poke
[04:02:14] <dkg> fejj: ahoy!  thanks for the gmime release :)
[04:02:32] <fejj> no prob
[04:05:51] <dkg> if you want to make an OpenPGP certificate for signing gmime release tarballs, and it doesn't need to be able to accept signatures, the simplest thing to do might be to use a sop implementation or sq.  (i'm sorting out how to integrate that with git right now)
[04:08:16] <dkg> in debian, both sqop and sq are available.
[04:09:03] <dkg> as to whether the user ID needs to have an e-mail address attached to it, i wouldn't worry about it.  Make a User ID of just your first name and last name, with no e-mail address if you like.  as long as you publish it someplace and maintain it, you can add or remove separate e-mail addresses over its lifetime.
[04:09:22] <dkg> (if you look at my certificate C29F8A0C01F35E34D816AA5CE092EB3A5CA10DBA it uses this split-user-id approach)
[04:10:12] <dkg> sorry, i just realized i wrote sometihng confused above:  "doesn't need to be able to accept signatures" should have been "doesn't need to be able to accept encrypted messages"
[04:10:20] <dkg> that is, it is likely to just be a signing-only key.
[04:10:56] <fejj> ah, ok, I was re-reading that :)
[04:11:26] <fejj> so what are sop and sqop?

[21:41:06] <dkg> fejj: i've been meaning to talk to you about sop for other reasons besides signing gmime releases, btw.  i'm looking at how to better support encrypted/signed mail and wondering whether it makes sense to offer a gmime mechanism that works against a sop-like interface, in addition to the gpgme flavor
[21:41:30] <dkg> there's some discussion in sop about creating a C API to mirror the command-line interface
[21:42:44] <dkg> if that materializes, would gmime be interested in adopting that approach?  it would mean the caller of gmime would need to do more work around key management, but we already have some key handling bits with the autocrypt work.
[21:49:49] <fejj> I might be
[21:50:16] <fejj> hold on, kitty is bugging me for attention
[21:53:52] <fejj> wife wanted a cat, now he bugs me 24/7 to play fetch with him (he's like a dog). I seem to wear him out (he plops and refuses to budge) so I go back to my desk, type 1 sentence, and he hops on the desk and lays on the keyboard
[21:53:56] <fejj> ...and he's back :)

[22:11:16] <dkg> i don't have a sense of how much work such a sop-based cryptotooling would be for gmime yet (we don't even have the sop C API settled), but i wanted to float the idea so that if i get further along you aren't surprised by it
[22:11:35] <dkg> also, if you see any red flags, it'd be good to know about them ahead of time so i can try to avoid them
