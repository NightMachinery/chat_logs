[01:50:07] <Joanna> inky_: that’s interesting. What about animals do you have different names for different genders of animals. In English there are 6 different names for horses 5 of which define gender.
[01:51:27] <Joanna> In English the gender is very important for animals too.
[02:13:16] *** Quits: dez (uid92154@user/dez) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[02:29:56] <_inky> names are gender specific. mostly. but there are unisex names too.
[02:30:11] <_inky> for example, sevan, which is a lake name, can be given both to boys and girls.
[02:30:39] <_inky> btw sevan is important contributor of netbsd and minix.
[02:32:14] <_inky> my name is literally masculine name. 
[02:32:29] <_inky> norayr is translated to english as new man. nor = new
[02:36:43] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[02:52:24] <Joanna> So if you refer to people by name you know their gender. I assume you have words for men women boys girls?
[02:52:37] <_inky> of course. i mentioned that.
[02:52:51] <_inky> you can say 'that woman', but you cannot say 'she'.
[02:53:07] <_inky> you don't necessarily know gender by name.
[02:53:47] <_inky> i brought you the example. you may be able, but may not be able. same in english i guess. some names are common. 
[02:54:12] <_inky> and you cannot say 'her'.
[02:54:51] <_inky> from that sentence like "her/his phone" you cannot know if the owner of the phone is male or female.
[02:55:12] <_inky> it's just նա (na) for both sexes.
[02:55:29] <_inky> it can mean he or it can mean she.
[02:55:54] <_inky> իր (ir) can be his or her, you never know unless you know.
[02:56:53] <Joanna> All those words like I, me he ,him she,her they,them indicate whether someone is performing or receiving an action
[02:57:19] <_inky> he/she is only one word in armenian. his/her is only one word for both.
[02:57:49] <Joanna> Do you have anything in Armenian that indicates if you are doing something or something is happening to you ?
[02:57:59] <_inky> of course.
[02:58:22] <_inky> but 'me' is genderless in english as well.
[02:58:30] <Joanna> And you
[02:58:52] <_inky> yes. in armenian like in german: դու (du)
[02:59:20] <_inky> we have seven cases.
[02:59:21] <Joanna> Is Armenian related to german at all?
[02:59:31] <_inky> yes, it is an indo-european language.
[02:59:48] <Joanna> I noticed conjugation is similar
[02:59:53] <_inky> but nobody knows where to put it on the tree. so they put it near the root as a unique and separate branch.
[03:00:28] <Joanna> Do you have word for me ?
[03:01:37] <Joanna> I think german has a lot more specifics for gender and neutral gender than English
[03:02:18] <_inky> yes, we have word for 'me'. (: and for 'i' too.
[03:02:25] <Joanna> I meant do you have different words for me and I like English does?
[03:02:30] <_inky> yes!
[03:03:06] <Joanna> How about similar thing for you? And third person references?
[03:03:29] <_inky> just found this: https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/7/1420647015259/3628f5a3-9110-4c01-bcfc-9b4ca9c00bd5-2060x1340.jpeg they put it again near the root of indo european languages, near greek.
[03:04:26] <_inky> what is 'similar thing'? on 'third person' i don't know what you ask. isn't 'she/he/they' third person?
[03:04:41] <_inky> just as i said those are genderless.
[03:05:45] <_inky> we have an oligarch who likes to talk about himself in third person.
[03:06:00] <_inky> if i say that sentence in armenian you cannot figure out if the oligarch in question a man or woman.
[03:11:55] <Joanna> That’s interesting I couldn’t find Armenian. Also it doesn’t show relationship between French and English. Maybe it’s is referring to old English
[03:14:41] <Joanna> Third person is he she they him her them it
[03:15:02] <Joanna> It is not supposed to be used for people though
[03:22:34] <Joanna> I found Armenian but I can’t find Turkish
[03:25:35] <_inky> why would you find turkish? it's not indo-european. (:
[03:27:57] <_inky> third person in armenian: he/she - նա (na); it - դա (da); they - նրանք (nrank) ; them - նրանց (nrants)
[03:28:29] <_inky> you can use google translate and make sure i am not lying
[03:28:44] <_inky> it uses one word for he or she.
[03:29:07] <_inky> https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=hy&text=he%20went%20to%20work&op=translate
[03:29:09] <_inky> he went to work
[03:29:32] <_inky> https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=hy&text=she%20went%20to%20work&op=translate
[03:29:34] <_inky> she went to work.
[03:29:40] <_inky> you can see that translation does not change.
[03:31:02] <Joanna> Do you know of any maps for  non European languages? I really liked that tree picture:) did same people make other ones “
[03:31:06] <Joanna> ?
[03:34:44] <_inky> i just found that picture by using duckduckgo and typing 'tree of indo-european languages' and it was a reddit link.
[03:34:56] <Joanna> Hmm
[03:35:09] <_inky> i saw some other maps but could not find the maps i saw before.
[03:35:22] <_inky> so i think you can find something if you search like that.

[04:26:03] <jan6> also, there are different words for formal and informal "you"
[04:26:34] <jan6> and of course, singular and plural second person are also different words
[04:28:45] <jan6> more confusingly, the more formal "you", is also plural

[05:38:47] <jan6> because then you start having a reason to differentiate, otherwise, it doesn't make a difference, as elaborating is easy, and usually unneeded

[16:39:36] <Atque> jessicara: Groups in the British Isles originated from elsewhere, most recently pre-modern Northern and Western Europe.
[16:41:12] <jessicara> yeah
[16:44:29] <Atque> Joanna: There is also vice-versa. Greek Australian families still have Greek food, churches, wedding etc. There is a kind of glocalisation, where cultural artefacts have penetrated previously monocultural regions. You can eat Japanese food with American music in Poland. You can practice Judo - a Japanese martial - in Rome etc.
[16:46:04] <Atque> American culture may enjoy some length of hegemony in certain groups, but it is also reprised by others. Nationalists are often anti-American, for example. In Anglo cultures too, there is a push for cultural diversity further... in terms of race, sexuality, gender, disability etc.
[16:46:36] <Atque> I don't think the 2020s are American-centric as the 1990s for example.
[16:53:56] <jessicara> yeah the 90s were very american centric here
[16:54:19] <jessicara> in fact we had more accurate american weather reporting here than for our own country through the 90s and to 2000s
