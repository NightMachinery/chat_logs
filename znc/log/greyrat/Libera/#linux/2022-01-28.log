[00:01:08] <libh> Nano is based off a proprietary editor called pico.

[00:01:30] <snowcode1> Nano is not free software?
[00:01:36] <stanrifkin> crashrep: no, nano is really worse. it's more like pico
[00:02:03] <libh> Nano is free software. It's a free libre implementation of the university of washington pico editor.
[00:02:04] <SpiceMan> snowcode1: nano is the free clone of pico
[00:02:05] <uwharrie> crashrep: Some of the keybindings overlap with emacs and readline, yes, but there are differences. The most commonly cited reason for emacs being difficult is that it uses its own vocabulary/DSL for everything

[11:37:04] <spyroboy> not to weigh in on source/binary distributed distributions, the one distro I'd really like to spend time with is nixOS.
[11:37:14] <colo> Haxxa, POSIX mandates that each buffer a write() syscall commits to storage arrive there completely. so if there are concurrent processes each writing "AA" and "BB" without coordination ad nauseam, you can/will see patterns like "AABBAAABBAA" etc., but never "ABABAB" or the like.

[11:37:51] <spyroboy> labrador, I mean the original compiler was a human.
[11:37:54] <colo> Haxxa, it is, however, possible, for a single write() call to be split up into several chunks of data that will be committed to storage according to that rule

[11:42:58] <vanessa> no no you don't need know the internals. I don't know internals but I can solve a lot of problems that people ask me help for
[11:43:18] <spyroboy> I'm not sure if the problem with the 'version' concept is necessarily a code versioning problem.
[11:43:37] <mlu> there's objects (files / folders), there's a log that points to those objects and the previous log versions (commits), and then there's branches (like sticky notes on those commits)
[11:43:38] <spyroboy> realistically a version is just a git ref. everything else is arbitrary designation.
[11:43:57] <mlu> vanessa: here's the thing: understanding the internals is much easier than understanding how to use git
[11:44:03] <mlu> for even a basic workflow involving merges
[11:44:05] <spyroboy> yea.
[11:44:15] <vanessa> https://www.biteinteractive.com/picturing-git-conceptions-and-misconceptions/
[11:44:27] <vanessa> ^ I'm talking about this one
[11:44:48] <spyroboy> the one thing that really caught me off guard was git stashes.
[11:44:50] <vanessa> this made it all strike at once
[11:44:51] <mlu> git stores versions, commits are log entries, and everything else is an illusion
[11:44:57] <spyroboy> I had no idea that git stashes were connected to the graph.
[11:46:06] <spyroboy> which both makes them very powerful but also you can end up losing a lot of work if you don't know how they work.

[14:06:48] <DPA> My WM groups outputs to workspaces, places them next to each other on the X screen, makes an X window for each workspace, and allows different modes of operations for each of them.
[14:06:48] <DPA> So the phone screen is a stacking WM, but the attached Dock / Screen & keyboard a workspace that's stacking. There are some problems with that (ICCCM/EWMH aren't considering such a setup, mirroring outputs is a problem, etc.), but I think when it's done, it's going to be quiet nice.
[14:07:00] <iflema> it tiles and its dynamic
[14:07:10] <spyroboy> it's not a dynamic tiler.

[15:57:08] <hexnewbie> Let's Encrypt is easier than generating a self-signed certificate (I have to look up the arcane 'openssl' syntax every time), and it's well-documented, with instructions for your specific OS. I've also found not following the instructions as opposed to doing what you remember doing the last time BREAKS, so just go to the site, go to tutorial and do it

[16:52:21] <bittin> or Ghost?
[16:52:42] <mrfb> you just offer Linux admin as a Service, a lot of people just want to play with X (forum software, wordpress, whatever) and don't want to deal with the "screen with text and commands"

[20:27:11] <apteryx> kfrench: perhaps I'm lacking some kconfig basics; is the SND_EMU10K1 module intended to be manually set to 'y', or should it be built as a module automatically out of the box if its dependencies are met?

[20:27:56] <kfrench> In general, the defconfig will default things to 'n'.  Certainly new features or drivers would.  Obviously EMU10K isn't new.

[20:30:13] <kfrench> I consider defconfig to be "Whatever works for Linus".  More generally, "What works for Linus and a huge portion of the userbase".  It's not intended to build every driver that's known to be working.

[23:03:51] <eoli3n> user can't connect without ldap, ldap cannot connect without WIFI, WIFI cannot authenticate without a user connected
[23:03:55] <mrfb> one thing is the wifi connection, another is the user auth
[23:03:57] <eoli3n> so what's the way
[23:03:57] <hexnewbie> labrador: The system ones (except for log rotations) shouldn't normally do more work, but you should see what happens when I stop the company ones for some time. Ooh. Fun ensues when you start them back.
[23:03:59] <stwange> Anyone recommend a good fast lightweight recursive dns resolver that can handle millions of queries? BIND keeps crashing and has memory leaks, powerdns seems ok but I feel like I could use something faster (it's doing around 20k requests a minute)
[23:04:13] <labrador> lmao
[23:04:18] <mrfb> eoli3n: first and above all, which kind of wifi setup are we talking here?

[23:05:04] <ayecee> eoli3n: why does the wifi require the user's credentials?

[23:05:57] <eoli3n> what's differs between 802.1x and simple wpa authentication ?
[23:06:01] <ayecee> eoli3n: then wifi should authenticate the laptops, not the users.
[23:06:15] <mrfb> whoever*
[23:06:24] <ayecee> eoli3n: the wifi should already been connected using machine-specific credentials, before the user logs in.
[23:06:34] <eoli3n> mrfb anybody needs to learn everything
[23:07:09] <eoli3n> ok i got this, that's what i told to the network guys
[23:07:11] <ayecee> eoli3n: the difference is that every user shares the same password with simple wpa auth, while with enterprise auth, each connection is authenticated separately.
[23:07:24] <eoli3n> they told me that windows does authenticate to wifi with users credentials
[23:07:33] <eoli3n> then don't know about linux, so i need to figure it out alone
[23:07:41] <mrfb> you need the architecture of that wifi

[23:25:58] <ayecee> which, while not impossible, is a whole circus of hoops to jump through.
[23:26:23] <hexnewbie> skered: I'm sure NFSv4 ACLs supports that (it has separate append permissions, and can have inheritance set for a directory). But Linux doesn't support it, and the richacl patches providing it were rejected with “too complex, who needs that”

[23:49:59] <sathylias> Hey there, I was wondering if someone could help me diagnose crashes on my system, it just stops responding and I need to reboot it.. https://bpa.st/O7PQ
[23:50:19] <Intelo> mrfb ok.. no idea.. will search
[23:50:34] <Intelo> is graphviz the best out there?
[23:51:18] <ayecee> why, are there other options?
[23:51:21] <mrfb> sathylias: did that happend after trying to wake up after suspension/hybernaton=
[23:51:40] <Yotha> hi, what would be the best linux channel to expose CIFS module loading problems after a kernel update ?
[23:52:05] <ayecee> Yotha: for what purpose
[23:52:12] <sathylias> mrfb: Humm, I believe it did, but the crashes also happens while I'm working on it.
[23:52:28] <mrfb> sathylias: any more details you can think of?

[23:57:54] <ayecee> the kernel module isn't part of samba, though.
[23:58:35] <hexnewbie> 128 GB may sound like enouhg, bht if you have 70% of that allocated to VMs (or otherwise), and overcommit disabled, the kernel can ENOMEM

[23:58:54] <peetaur> is it fedora? ;) fedora is the worst at everything so probably that too ...they have the perfect imbalance of bleeding edge and stable. It's not like arch and gentoo where it's supposed to be bleeding edge, so they know and expect and prevent update breakage... and it's not stable like an LTS.
