[20:25:02] <ph88> hey guys, i found a client configuration file with  ca, cert, key, tls-auth blocks in it ... what do these mean ?
[20:36:51] <colo> those are X.509-related data required to authenticate the server against the client, and vice versa. tl;dr: "it's complicated and complex".

[21:47:21] <rob0> They're also documented in the manual: https://build.openvpn.net/man/openvpn-2.5/openvpn.8.html , search for "--ca", "--cert", "--key" and "--tls-auth".  Perhaps also see the section on "INLINE FILE SUPPORT", if that is what you meant to ask.
[21:48:02] <rob0> "blocks" implies inline files
[21:48:29] <rob0> ph88: you could also ask your VPN admin.
[21:55:32] <mzar> ph88: do you mean using one file with .ovpn extension instead of 5 files ?

[22:02:37] <ph88> colo, rob0 thanks
[22:02:45] <ph88> rob0, im afraid im the vpn admin now haha
[22:03:02] <ph88> mzar, yes there is one file   client.conf
[22:03:14] <rob0> ph88, then that client configuration file won't work for you.
[22:03:17] *** Joins: finsternis (~X@23.226.237.192)
[22:03:33] <mzar> rob0: why so?
[22:04:04] <mzar> ph88: it's a file with tags, like html tags, but usually such a file has .ovpn extension
[22:04:57] *** Joins: splud (~noneya.bi@user/splud)
[22:09:18] <rob0> I assume the .ovpn file was generated to connect to some other VPN.
[22:10:11] <rob0> If you're the VPN admin and have found such a thing, it probably won't work for you.
[22:12:47] <mzar> ?
[22:12:52] <mzar> why it wouldnt ?
[22:13:16] <mzar> I prepare configs in one file for my clients
[22:14:27] <rob0> if you didn't prepare it, how would it connect to your VPN?
[22:15:05] <rob0> it can work IF THE FILES ARE FOR YOUR VPN only.
[22:15:20] <mzar> I don't get it
[22:16:06] <rob0> ph88 | hey guys, i found a client configuration file with  ca, cert, key, tls-auth blocks in it ... what do these mean ?
[22:16:19] <rob0> who made it?
[22:16:28] <mzar> admin 
[22:16:38] <rob0> but he IS the admin
[22:16:51] <mzar> former admin
[22:25:55] <rob0> ph88: did the former VPN admin make this file?
[22:35:43] <ph88> yes former admin made it
[22:35:47] <ph88> he left the company

[22:45:19] <rob0> Could have been an Access Server profile, but as you point out, normally those would be named with .ovpn
[22:47:11] *** Quits: jmark (~jmark@laguna07.dericnet.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:47:48] <mzar> providing desktop users with such files is better, otherwise some of them get lost

[22:52:18] <rob0> Access Server is nice for the admin: you give a user the username/password; they get the profile via client web interface; they connect.
[22:57:57] <colo> ah, that's a product?
[22:59:54] <colo> it is! funny. being unaware, I wrote something to pretty much the effect of that back in 2015 for a previous employer of mine :) (it delivered an NSIS installer wrapping the OpenVPN clinet installation for win32 and included the client cert at al.)
[23:00:55] <colo> https://johannes.truschnigg.info/csr/ came from it, if anyone's interested in making their life operating a CA for humans' certs easier
[23:02:09] <mzar> rob0: I am using it without any special software, just for my, client's and support convenience
[23:05:38] <rob0> haha, colo, now I am employed supporting it.  I knew it was there, but I never knew how very simple it makes life for the admin.  Since now my personal VPN needs are very modest, I started using AS.
[23:06:25] <rob0> but, I am planning soon to set up a 2.5.5 server with linux-dco
[23:07:30] <colo> rob0, cool, I was not aware you working there! :) knowing that, I'll pitch OpenVPN at the next "which VPN solution should we replace the existing crap with?" round of internal meetings.
[23:07:41] <rob0> awesome
[23:08:11] <mzar> is Access Server a kind of webservice or an overlay on openvpn ?
[23:08:52] <rob0> Access Server is a suite of openvpn with a built-in web server and TLS CA, self-hosted
[23:09:10] <mzar> oh.. I see
[23:09:45] <rob0> and I really don't intend to be pitching it here, but ^^ personal experience, it's easy
[23:10:33] <rob0> I'm here to support community openvpn
[23:11:31] <mzar> I have scripted this with shell and perl on easy-rsa including sharing certificates and email correspondence with clients
[23:12:43] <rob0> nice
[23:12:58] <mzar> it was really time consuming process
[23:13:33] <rob0> problem with sending a "ovpn" all-in-one file in email, it's not secure, but it contains a private key
[23:14:10] <rob0> AS deals with that by using https and user authentication
[23:14:13] <colo> we had a (more streamlined, less flexible) variant of the form I linked to above hooked up to the support ticket queue, and our own OpenSSL-based CA impl. around that to sign CSRs. worked pretty great, even the less technical people in the org.
[23:14:33] <mzar> rob0: I am not sending it in e-mail
[23:16:01] <mzar> also private key can be encrypted, I don't know how reliable is this encryption if you have for example 20 characters long password ?
[23:17:01] <rob0> I think gpg -c would be reasonably safe, as long as the passphrase is not guessable.  But I bet you aren't using gpg?
[23:17:40] <rob0> oh, you mean encrypting the key as openssl does it?
[23:18:06] <rob0> That's as secure as the passphrase, AFAIK.
[23:18:38] <rob0> But the drawback is that a user has to provide the passphrase to be able to use the key.
[23:18:43] <colo> rob0, with access server, does the server generate/ever learn the private key of the user?
[23:20:29] <rob0> it generates it.  And it stores it.  Not ideal from a security standpoint, but designed to be Easy for non-techie users.
[23:21:15] <rob0> The client keys and certs are only ever used in generating a profile for the user.
[23:21:40] <rob0> but a user can always go back and get another one.
[23:22:34] <rob0> Nowadays the AS CA generates a new key/cert for a new profile request.
[23:23:08] <colo> yeah, I think I understand :) I wanted to avoid that (not because o an actual threat model that would suggest it was bad for the IT dept. to know/have the pirvate keys o our users), but because I had learned of WebPKI, and this opening up an avenue to make this actually rather user friendly
[23:23:35] <colo> maybe your product team wants to consider considering the approach ;)
[23:23:53] <colo> could make for a nice compliance checkbox item for paranoid customers, if nothing else
[23:24:37] <rob0> we have documentation for using an external PKI
[23:31:57] <colo> no doubt :) I just wanted to raise awareness that it's possible to do PKI stuff in the browser without having the server involved with private key material, like the Gods intended it ;)
[23:34:38] <rob0> right.  Funny thing about me and AS is that for years I have griped at people here (and the predecessor channel) about having their PKI on the server! :)
[23:35:02] <rob0> (I still do sometimes.)
[23:36:50] <colo> oh yes. if I had a dollar for each time some supposedly really important entity (say, a bank, or also a branch of the federal government) would send me "my keypair" as signed by their CA in an "encrypted ZIP archive" for authenticating my privileged and confidential access to some resource, I'd have.... several dollars, at least!
[23:37:01] <colo> (eben though I'd more probably have several Euros instead)
[23:39:05] <rob0> If you get enough of them to take to Starbucks, you can have coffee! :)
