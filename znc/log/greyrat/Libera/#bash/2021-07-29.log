[06:17:01] <greybot> The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082

[12:09:14] <stevenm_> morning :)  what might be the easiest way of sending some text to stdout that uses colour codes... but also sending a copy of that (e.g. tee perhaps) to a file *without* the colour codes?

[12:24:14] <geirha> most sane commands can be told to not output the terminal escapes. Many even do it automatically when they detect that stdout is not a tty
[12:27:14] <zeraphel> any tips on figuring out which functions are leaving zombies around?

[12:46:10] <kurahaupo> stevenm_: the general form of a control sequence is CSI followed by any number of bytes in the 20-3F range, followed by a byte in the 40-7E range (though you should stop as soon as you get to any byte that's not 20-3F
[12:46:51] <kurahaupo> CSI being either 1B 5B or 9B

[22:01:15] <twkm> reasons can be that the idiots over at openbsd decided groups aren't allowed to do things for members, i.e., g+w on .ssh/authorized_keys* will cause it to be ignored.
[22:01:55] *** Joins: ormaaj219 (~ormaaj219@user/ormaaj)
[22:02:15] <twkm> granted people can make mistakes, but their nanny-ism is annoying to some.  (yes me)

[22:04:18] <Guest62> @geirha how restrictive does it need to be?
[22:04:40] <twkm> as i indicated, no group and thus no world access.
[22:04:45] <geirha> depends on the ssh server
[22:05:13] <geirha> but yeah, chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  should be a safe bet
[22:05:15] <twkm> i.e., chmod -R go=

[22:05:55] <twkm> the server logged the reason it didn't like it.
[22:06:02] <greycat> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/SshKeys  or #openssh
[22:06:05] <Guest62> why could it not just thow the error with -vvv?
[22:06:16] <greycat> the server does not reveal the reason to the client
[22:06:18] <twkm> the client isn't told why.
[22:06:19] <tirnanog> because that would entail the server leaking information
[22:06:30] <Guest62> makes sense
[22:06:43] <geirha> "Sorry that password is in use by another user. Please choose another"
[22:06:55] <twkm> that .ssh was go= should have sufficed, but no ... wankers.

[22:07:43] <Soliton> what's the nohup nonsense?
[22:08:10] <geirha> running nohup is completely pointless
[22:09:21] <Guest278> then what should I use if not nohup?
[22:09:30] <Soliton> for what?
[22:09:52] <twkm> why do you think you need nohup on one but not the other?
[22:09:54] <greycat> A script doesn't need to do anything special to run a program in the background, besides putting & on the line.
[22:10:34] <twkm> i.e., don't nohup, probably the $( and ) are equally useless -- smells cargo-culted.

[22:11:18] <geirha> assuming you want the terminal to die after
[22:11:42] <greycat> they're running a command which spits out a different command on stdout, and then they want to run the command that was spat out?
[22:11:50] <geirha>  but now the command will be orphaned, which is far from ideal
[22:12:58] <geirha> fzf is a curses(?) thing that lets you choose a line from stdin
[22:14:20] <twkm> all i know about it is i hated the completion that got installed along with the program.
[22:14:48] <Guest278> so i want to be able to run "fzf_run" which launches st, and executes "fzfmenu" in the new terminal, which gives me a list of all files in /usr/bin, when i select one, it runs it
[22:15:57] <Soliton> presumably the sh process is useless as well.
[22:15:58] <geirha> it seems rather useless to me. Unlike dialog and whiptail where you can specify an id and a value, so the user only sees the value, but the id gets output in the end, with fzf you have to display the whole line; no way to have a hidden id.
[22:16:58] <geirha> would be better if the window manager launced it so it can control it
[22:17:18] <geirha> If you launch it from a terminal like that, it will be orphaned and no way to control it

[22:42:37] <greycat> Oh, this is *that* WM.  I don't remember the name, but it's the one that you can't configure except by editing its source code and recompiling it.

[23:37:57] <kurahaupo> geirha: Unless you're targeting Debian, who apparently decided that "nobody uses ed any more, so it's not in the base system install"
[23:38:13] <greycat> I'm sure Debian isn't the only one
[23:38:36] <greycat> also pax is an optional package in Debian
[23:39:51] <kurahaupo> That really annoys me; if I write a POSIX compliant script, I shouldn't have to double check every bloody OS to see what they might have left out. What's the point of POSIX if they're not going to even try to comply
[23:40:21] <earnestly> kurahaupo: You shouldn't
[23:40:31] <earnestly> Just wash your hands of it
[23:40:47] <kurahaupo> (It's one thing to say "sorry, that's too hard for us to implement right now", but it is entirely another to remove something that was working)
[23:40:55] <earnestly> This is honestly the best thing you can do, for everyone involved
[23:41:30] <earnestly> So much complexity and inflexible crap is due to this need for people to "check dependencies" when it's not their job
[23:42:47] <kurahaupo> Talking of checking dependencies, I really can't see the point of the idiom foo=$( which foo ) … $foo --bar
[23:43:02] <greycat> You're writing this script to run on Unix systems.  It's being run by people who chose to run a Unix.  If the script says "myscript: pax: command not found" the Unix user should be able to figure out how to fix that.
[23:43:08] <greycat> You shouldn't have to hand-hold them.
