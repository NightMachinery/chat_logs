[00:19:49] <peve> Just to be sure, using the regular installer with "encryption" option, Debian encrypts the kernel and root with the same key, but grub remains decrypted. We will provide the passphrase to grub, which will decrypt the kernel and save a keyfile, which will later be used by the kernel to decrypt root. Am I understanding the default process right?

[04:55:52] <Auprivave> linux update worked, but didnt fix the blank screen issue. There is no coming back from suspend or turned off screen on the thinkpad x260. But Ubuntu solved it. How did they do that?

[05:33:43] <Blondie101010> look at the exact driver that is used by Ubuntu, both for the kernel and for X

[14:52:54] <via_c7> let me check if i can
[14:53:24] <Cool_Fire> If you right-click the folder you want to paste files into and select "properties" you should get a new window with a "permissions" tab that lets you see which user owns it

[14:59:36] <PerfDave> (p2v standing for "physical to virtual" in this context)
[15:00:26] <Cool_Fire> But the dd operation is not destructive on the source device, so there's no harm in trying (other than possibly wasting some time)
[15:00:29] <PerfDave> There's probably some guidance for creating a qcow2 image from a disk device, rather than using dd which will create a raw one (which needs to be the same size as the source disk, no compression of empty space etc.)
[15:01:13] <jelly> dokma, have you ever migrated an installation from one hardware platform to another?  P2V is basically the same thing.

[15:50:26] <randall> mrig: Those log entries are irrelevant to your issue. What is the shutdown issue in detail?
[15:52:03] <mrig> thank you for taking a look randall, on shutdown the GUI environment closes but there is none of the logging sent to the terminal output that is usually there, it says shutting down but then nothing happens and I have to press and hold the power button to close it down.
[15:53:56] <mrig> I am experiencing intermittent input freezes with both the mouse and the keyboard, currently using an ergodox, the driver of which logs an complaint to the journalctl log when this happens.

[16:20:37] <rawtaz> uh, long shot question but does anyone here possibly know if theres a way to make the list of screens in `screen` (e.g. ctrl+a ") show the commands that are currently running/active under the current shell in each screen? all i see now is just a list of ten bash instances, not very useful.
[16:20:38] <mrig> I think that this kernal was included in an update of debian 10 that I made not long before reinstalling but can not confirm that really though.
