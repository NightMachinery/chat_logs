[00:50:10] <NFLD99> Hello, im currently trying to get my regex working to match rgb colour codes, and have them separate, however it seems to keep matching the whole line rather than just between rgb and the first ) it finds, ive been baning my head for a few hours on this i might just be being dumb, but heres the regex link: https://regex101.com/r/NQMFa5/1/
[00:51:33] <OnlineCop> Change `.*` to `.*?`
[00:51:43] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/NQMFa5/2
[00:52:49] <NFLD99> thank you, i feel dumb now i thought i tried that lol
[00:52:56] <OnlineCop> Will it be rgb(x,y,z) and rgba(x,y,z,w) ?
[00:53:17] <NFLD99> yeah using it to generate a :root for colours 
[00:54:30] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/NQMFa5/3 separates them into 4 groups.
[00:54:55] <OnlineCop> If the alpha group is missing (for when you use rgb(x,y,z) ), it returns 3 groups.

[02:36:42] <rjarmon> Here's my regex101 link. I'm trying to convert it from PHP >=7.3 to JavaScript.
[02:36:44] <rjarmon> https://regex101.com/r/bgMd4o/1
[02:37:07] <OnlineCop> You probably don't need more than the first (?i)
[02:37:47] <OnlineCop> Are you trying to capture "Player id" or the value after it: "test" ?
[02:38:14] <rjarmon> Both
[02:38:35] <OnlineCop> Will you always have 4 lines, in this order?
[02:38:54] <OnlineCop> Or do you want to capture "Player id" and its "test" OR "Device name" and its "test" , etc.?
[02:39:47] <rjarmon> I'm writing a bot command that will do something if the users follow the "Player ID: info Device name: info OS version: info Details: info" format and then tell them their format is wrong if they don't
[02:39:56] <rjarmon> So trying to force them to use that order basically.
[02:40:40] <OnlineCop> Is "test" a single word, or can they be multiple space/tab-separated words?
[02:40:52] <OnlineCop> Or UUIDs or some other kind of text?
[02:41:17] <rjarmon> It can be multiple space/tab-separated. I want to allow them to put as much info as they want/need, but want to make sure they include that information in that order.
[02:41:35] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/bgMd4o/1
[02:42:25] <OnlineCop> You'll need to update the TEST STRING to account for all the various newlines/single-lines/whatever that it needs to try to process.
[02:43:06] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/bgMd4o/2 as an example.
[02:43:08] <rjarmon> Yeah it's working in PHP, but I'm trying to get it to work in JavaScript and the "?" is giving me an error because it's looking for something preceding instead of the way it works in PHP.
[02:43:31] <OnlineCop> Javascript just uses the /i flag instead of the inline (?i)
[02:43:47] <rjarmon> Ah
[02:44:13] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/bgMd4o/3
[02:45:15] <OnlineCop> Notice line 8, where "Device name:" appears before "Player ID". Is that something that can occur out of order and be valid, or does it make it invalid?
[02:46:37] <rjarmon> It needs to be invalid if they put it out of order
[02:49:36] <rjarmon> Thank you for your help! The syntax is quite different from PHP to JS and I was just getting used to how regex in PHP worked, so this will take a little getting used to. Thanks again!
[02:49:45] <OnlineCop> My pleasure.

[03:28:27] <fallore> I'm not sure how to include sample data within the regex101 app, so here are some things it should match: 8.5x11, 11x17, 1.25x7.66, 19x13, 1x2

[18:42:57] <Lope> I've got some magical number format that looks like this

[18:43:06] <Lope> where # is a \d
[18:43:08] <digitok> sweet
[18:43:21] <digitok> where can i get one
[18:43:30] <Lope> So the user gives a regex to match it like so: ^[12]\d{3}\/\d{6}\/\d{2}$
[18:43:41] <Lope> (JavaScript regex)
[18:43:54] <Lope> Any ideas how I can remove whatever doesn't conform to that?
[18:44:07] <Lope> Without knowing the format requirement in advance
[18:44:15] <Lope> I suppose it's more of a javascript question
[18:44:36] <Lope> oh, I forgot to mention that the first 4 #### is the year lolz
[18:44:36] <digitok> yea, i'm confused
[18:44:50] <digitok> remove what from where
[18:45:10] <Lope> let's say the user writes abc
[18:45:16] <Lope> that won't match so should be removed
[18:45:29] <digitok> ok, so the user provides the regex and the data?
[18:45:34] <Lope> But what if they write 2005
[18:45:46] <Lope> so that's a partial match, should be allowed
[18:46:00] <Lope> Just kind of enforcing what the user can't enter
[18:46:10] <digitok> you said the user gives a regex
[18:46:17] <Lope> well, the form provides the regex
[18:46:21] <Lope> the user types stuff in
[18:46:30] <Lope> but I'm not hard coding the form
[18:46:41] <Lope> ah, more like the dev gives regex
[18:46:46] <Lope> form dev
[18:46:48] <Lope> front-end dev
[18:46:50] <digitok> ok lol
[18:47:21] <Lope> Sorry if I didn't explain well
[18:47:33] <digitok> and it needs to remove chars as they're typed?
[18:47:59] <Lope> I mean I thought maybe
[18:48:01] <digitok> so if i type 12345 it removes 5 because it isn't /
[18:48:03] <digitok> or something
[18:48:06] <Lope> yeah
[18:48:13] <Lope> but that seems very complicated
[18:48:17] <Lope> given I can't know the regex
[18:48:20] <digitok> it does :D
[18:48:26] <Lope> so perhaps I should just validate the completed field
[18:48:32] <Lope> and if it doesn't match, then complain.
[18:48:37] <digitok> that'd be much easier
[18:48:43] <Lope> yeah, will do :)
[18:49:46] <digitok> i have seen forms like that though, but it's probably hardcoded
[18:49:56] <digitok> not sure how you'd do it with a pre-existing regex
[18:50:15] <Lope> yeah, I'm not looking for a PhD from this, so I'll forget about it :) thanks
[18:50:20] <digitok> haha
[18:50:25] <Lope> PhD = permanent head damage.
[18:50:36] <digitok> aw, was gonna say i'll figure it out for a phd
[18:50:42] <digitok> but noty
[18:51:03] <Lope> I don't think it's actually doable
[18:51:24] <Lope> cos you'd have to programmatically, with brute force cut up the regex until you get pieces of valid regex
[18:51:29] <digitok> yea, you'd need to parse the regex itself
[18:51:31] <Lope> then run it against pieces of the string.
[18:51:42] <digitok> yep, that'd be my assumption
[18:51:47] <Lope> I mean it's doable if you enforce that the regex must be character by character.
[18:51:52] <Lope> so instead of \d{3}
[18:51:57] <Lope> it should be \d\d\d
[18:51:59] <Lope> etc.
[18:52:03] <digitok> yep
[18:52:12] <Lope> that's simple enough
[18:52:22] <Lope> But then might as well not use regex at all
[18:52:28] <Lope> and just use # to represent \d
[18:52:38] <Lope> and A or something to represent alphanumeric and so on.
[18:52:42] <digitok> but if you wanted to use groups etc, it'd get very complicated
[18:52:50] <Lope> y eah
[18:53:23] <digitok> yea, your ###/### example would be much easier for that
[18:53:29] <Lope> for shizzle
[18:53:40] <digitok> screw regex, we're switching to that
[18:53:42] <Lope> I actually prefer it to regex
[18:53:44] <Lope> yeah
[18:53:47] <Lope> I think so
[18:53:54] <digitok> :D
[18:53:59] <Lope> cos regex is hard for form maker types.
[18:54:06] <digitok> indeed

[19:20:50] <OnlineCop> I just worry that `^(?<Lang>[^\s*].*)` will match more than you probably want it to.
[19:21:37] <OnlineCop> [0-9].*  will match '3' without anything after it. Try [0-9].+
[19:22:02] <OnlineCop> Better: [0-9]+\s.*
[19:22:14] <OnlineCop> Or [^\r\n\S] instead of \s
[19:22:34] <StayHungry> as you might remember, i used asterisks earlier, but then decided to use numbers, because parsing asterisks indexes, especially when alternative solutions added gets dirty
[19:23:30] <StayHungry> eventually i may use some known data format, but so far i found none which is both machine and human readable, surely not json
[19:24:01] <OnlineCop> Is this using PCRE?
[19:24:09] * OnlineCop is itching to use (?(DEFINE)...)
[19:24:25] <StayHungry> err... NET parser is used, it's for PowerShell
[19:25:36] <OnlineCop> What's your iteration scheme going to be? No longer lines starting with '*' but it accepts digits (possibly followed by a letter), then some kind of whitespace, followed by the text you want to keep?

[19:26:47] <StayHungry> each paragraphs first line defines information about language, the rest are oneliners (main and alternatives)
[19:27:10] <StayHungry> oneliners format: Number(a)SpaceData
[19:28:37] <OnlineCop> `[0-9]+a?[\t ]` perhaps?
[19:28:51] <OnlineCop> Will it only ever be '3a' and never '3b'?
[19:28:59] <StayHungry> a means alternative
[19:29:04] <OnlineCop> `[0-9]+[a-z]?[\t ]`
[19:29:19] <StayHungry> so there could be only one 3 and many 3a 3a 3a 3a
[19:29:36] <OnlineCop> Alright, well, adjust as you need.
[19:30:29] <StayHungry> sorry if it sounds dumb, i come from humanities and perhaps best practices of the computer world contradict my vision :)
[19:32:51] <StayHungry> v2 works as expected, now let's see what [0-9]+[a-z]?[\t ] means...
[19:33:50] <StayHungry> hmm, it works as well :D
[19:34:20] <OnlineCop> That would have allowed '3b'
[19:34:40] <OnlineCop> If you know it will be an 'a' every time, use the `[0-9]+a?[\t ]` one.
[19:34:50] <OnlineCop> That is: any digits, and then 'a' is optional.
[19:35:46] <OnlineCop> Does the Language line always have the language name and then 1-2 commas?
[19:35:56] <OnlineCop> You might put that in there somewhere.
[19:37:30] <StayHungry> first line is [language] , [version] , [command line launcher command]

[21:30:59] <StayHungry> OnlineCop: could you be so kind to tell me why you used [0-9]+a?[\t ] but not [0-9]+a?\s
[21:31:23] <OnlineCop> You said that '3[newline]' shouldn't have matched. So it looks for a non-newline whitespace.
[21:31:46] <OnlineCop> I've also used [^\S\r\n] if you want to allow OTHER horizontal whitespace beyond tabs/spaces.
