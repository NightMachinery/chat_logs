[17:24:48] <tschilptschilp23> Hi all! I'm a bit confused about libera.chat and freenode -- here: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel I read that everything has migrated from freenode to libera. But from matrix I still can join via freenode (and don't really know, if this here is a bridge or vice-versa).  Any hints?

[17:48:45] <bandali> hi tschilptschilp23, #emacs has migrated to libera, but #org-mode officially has not (but it likely will, soon hopefully)
[17:49:16] <bandali> once an official decision/announcement about migration of #org-mode is made, we will look into seeing if we can do anything w.r.t. the matrix bridge
[17:49:27] <bandali> (i'm not matrix expert, and i'd welcome help with that when the time comes)
[17:51:16] <tschilptschilp23> <bandali "hi tschilptschilp23, #emacs has "> Hi! thanks for the info! Where do I actually end up with the #org-mode:matrix.org channel?
[17:52:07] <bandali> cheers. not sure to be honest, i don't use matrix. i'm reading/writing these replies on libera right now
[17:52:51] <tschilptschilp23> ah, and i'm writing from element.io, hence the confusion!
[17:53:03] <bandali> :-)
[17:57:36] <tschilptschilp23> for me it nicely works to join libera from matrix adapting this guide: https://kparal.wordpress.com/2021/06/01/connecting-to-libera-chat-through-matrix/
[17:59:09] <bandali> cool, thanks for the link!

[19:13:30] <RunLevelRobot> awesome thanks!
[19:14:10] <RunLevelRobot> would you know what caused that?
[19:14:27] <grym> by default, _foo is subscripting 
[19:14:54] <RunLevelRobot> Would it be a setting in my init.el file?
[19:15:01] <grym> or per-document, your choice
[19:15:17] <RunLevelRobot> what is the name of the setting in my init.el file?

[19:15:21] <grym> i think 
[19:15:23] <RunLevelRobot> ok

[19:15:29] <RunLevelRobot> thx guys
[19:15:50] <grym> if you set it to {}, that means that `foo_bar` is unchanged, but `foo_{bar}` is rendered as foo-subscript-bar
[19:16:00] <grym> which is _usually_ what you want. 
[19:16:08] <grym> if you want that to never ever mean subscripting, then set it to nil

[19:57:23] <zebrag> One "input garbage" file. One file where I send the captures to. All the Readme.org, that I tend to put everywhere in git repos: all those clearly, I can trim, through, org-capture (or refile, or not, anyway). Then there are attachments, if I make a quote or a comment about a document, of some sort, I can put the document, or image, in the attachment directory (that the document is duplicated in the process is no worries). If for some reason I want to be 
[19:57:25] <zebrag> thorough, even though it seems impracticable, I can attach some sort of bibtex reference card to the document (maybe not so impracticable after all). All that only to address issue described in first paragraph of https://sachachua.com/blog/2015/02/learn-take-notes-efficiently-org-mode/, which cripples me too.

[19:58:49] <grym> sounds bikesheddy
[20:00:30] <zebrag> hum
[20:01:43] <rdrg109> We should have a ":protect yes" header argument for protecting those code blocks that show important "#+RESULTS" so that org-babel-remove-result-one-or-many with a prefix argument doesn't remove those #+RESULTS

[20:06:49] <Demosthenex> it's because org-mode has no design

[20:07:45] <grym> there's always grep
[20:07:56] <composite_higgs> Is it just me or does org-babel-js not respect the :dir header argument on code blocks?
[20:08:10] <composite_higgs> No matter how I set :dir when I log __dirname from the js block it is a temporary directory.
[20:08:57] <zebrag> But I'm strong advocate of "shared experiences/best practices". Up to some point.
[20:09:40] <grym> "start small, add stuff when you find that you need it"
[20:10:04] <Demosthenex> zebrag: sure, that's why people advertise their model, their system, of making documents with org. org-roam, zettlekast, etc are all just systems built on org
[20:10:12] <zebrag> What do you call the file you send captures to?
[20:10:13] <Demosthenex> but org has no design of what you make other than basic document components
[20:10:26] <grym> zebrag: i don't use org-capture 
[20:10:28] <grym> (yet?)

[20:11:02] <rdrg109> composite_higgs: I don't use org-babel-js but could it be the session (I'm not sure whether org babel support sessions for js)? This hapened to me with Python code blocks: although I've set the :dir header argument, the directory was already set in the session so that directory was being used instead.
[20:11:22] <Demosthenex> grym: another good point
[20:11:33] <Demosthenex> master the components until you can make the system the way you want
[20:11:41] <zebrag> grym: you go everywhere you took random notes. Then you select a region, then you do org capture. And then it's gone. See?

[20:15:48] <zebrag> rdrg109: I thought about capturing everything in the same pile of garbage. I could call it "midden".

[21:39:18] <Demosthenex> capture is meant to allow you to quickly enter information, like a popup note to file away for later. later it was expanded where people use it as a kind of data entry template for regular files.
