[00:00:20] <qbt> i need a symbol to denote the remainder of an integer mod 2
[00:00:33] <nomagno> nimaje: Why would it give the wrong value though? It is explicitly referring to the smallest difference, which in the original question is implied to mean "the absolute value of the difference"
[00:01:19] <nomagno> Which... Is the absolute value of the remainder, or the absolute value of the remainder minus the divisor, whichever is smaller
[00:02:14] <nomagno> qbt: Uh, so, SYMBOL X means X mod 2?
[00:02:16] <nimaje> oh, for some reason I throught they still want that remainder

[00:02:33] <XCode> Z-module:  if f : X -> Y finite surjective morphism between smooth projective varieties of same dimension is the push forward on cohomology surjective/injective i.e. is f^{*} : H^{k,k}(Y) --> H^{k,k}(X) surjective/injective?
[00:03:07] <qbt> nomagno, yes i want something more space efficient
[00:03:26] <nimaje> how about [x]_2?
[00:04:02] <qbt> nimaje, that is what i wrote now but idk if i am making it up in my head or if that is actually commonly understood haha
[00:04:17] <qbt> if it is that's great :)
[00:04:58] <nomagno> I really need to step up my math game... My education choices might lead me to temporarily get onto a situation where I don't get enough math education, but then after that I want to do a CS degree.
[00:04:59] <nimaje> no idea if commonly understood, but it is used at my university
[00:05:44] <qbt> nimaje, i guess I'll put a note in the margin or something to be sure
[00:05:47] <qbt> thanks!

[04:36:02] <Em> I could be totally wrong about that, but what do you think?
[04:36:14] <greenbagels> Em: differential geometry in 2D and 3D
[04:36:19] <greenbagels> logic
[04:36:22] <Em> I suggested that continued fractions is an example.

[04:37:41] <Em> I think diff geometry actually does get hit by a fair amount of undergrads and even in its most basic forms by high school calc students potentialy. The T-N-B frame for example.

[04:39:00] <Em> I think it's really easy to miss out on a lot of 'special function's unless you are taking the specific applied class where they are used

[04:40:37] <Em> Probably not common for undergrad math majors to do a coure on euclidean geometry, and it's not like high school is hitting the 9-point circle theorem.
[04:40:55] <Galois> well there are things like combinatorics and graph theory, which are not covered in a standard high school or a standard university math curriculum, but the good high school students will see these topics outside of high school

[04:43:05] <Em> In the past those curves were often well known enough to give them names
[04:43:13] <Em> now I think they have slipped through the cracks.
[04:43:15] <Galois> I think combinatorics up to generating functions, and graph theory up to (but not including) algebraic graph theory, and optimization up to and including Lagrange multipliers, are well known enough to most math majors
[04:43:27] <Em> Not taught in high school and scarcely mentioned in college.
[04:43:55] <Galois> but like I mean spectral graph theory, nonlinear optimization, convexity, and the kind of combinatorics that leads to tropical geometry or whatever, is not standard

[04:44:34] <Em> Okay sure, but I guess if you go up high enough then you are in such thin air that everything is scarce and specialized.
[04:44:53] <Galois> no but I don't think these topics are any more advanced than sheaf cohomology or whatever which is standard fare
[04:45:22] *** Joins: z4kpi (~z4kpi@user/zacts)
[04:45:34] <PlanckWalk> Heh, sheaf cohomology wasn't a topic at all when I was at uni
[04:45:43] <PlanckWalk> Not even in master's level
[04:45:50] <Em> The (possibly) perfect example of the kind of thing I have in mind is continued fractions, because that is a topic (in my opinion) that is both interesting, non-trivial, and totally accessible, and VERY easy for an otherwise bright student to graduate both high school and college and never see them in a class.
[04:46:30] <Galois> yes, I unusually learned continued fractions in high school and I unusually teach continued fractions in first-year university algebra
[04:46:47] <Em> Come on sheaf cohomology? Are you serious? :) Maybe you have in mind grad students, but for me, at that level, you're specializing a lot so you're going to get what you get. I'm talking about up to and including graduating as an undergraduate.
[04:47:09] <Galois> ok, seriously, it's probably not more advanced than Galois theory
[04:47:26] <PlanckWalk> The only mention I saw of continued fractions in class was a brief mention and very slight use in analysis
[04:47:38] <PlanckWalk> Not even in numerical methods!
[04:47:44] <Em> That's pretty cool then. I think Galois Theory is one of a few excellent cap stones for undergraduates.
[04:47:44] <Galois> we have undergraduate classes on symmetric functions, nonlinear optimization, and algebraic graph theory. We're the only ones almost.
[04:48:01] <Em> There's not enough time to hit more than 1 or 2 cap stones though probably.
[04:48:10] <Em> So you have to pick a path. I think.
[04:48:15] <PlanckWalk> I had read a couple of books on continued fractions in high school in self-study though.
[04:48:37] <Galois> I think there's not much choice. Every student pretty much needs to know Galois theory.

[04:50:27] <Em> hyberbolic trig functions won't show up for most people in high school and then they might get used in a physics/engineering class when they show up to solve a differential equation, but they aren't really given a lot of air time.
[04:50:28] <PlanckWalk> That seems reasonably if youa ctually do it properly
[04:50:57] <Galois> that we certainly do
[04:50:58] <Galois> Theorem unique_prime_factorization : ∀ x, 0 < x → ∀ L1 L2 : list Z, x = ∏' L1 → x = ∏' L2 → Permutation L1 L2.

[04:52:58] <Galois> my textbook actually messes it up
[04:53:21] <Galois> they allow negative primes in the definition of prime factorization, so 6 = 2*3 = (-2)*(-3) and stuff
[04:54:05] <Em> I think it's kind of sad that you can graudate as a math undergrad and never learn any complex analysis.
[04:54:14] <Galois> but I still use it, because I want students to encounter the idea that textbooks mess up
[04:54:24] <Em> complex numbers in general seeem just incredible.

[17:01:51] <confuzeus> tpanarch1st: i have had a quick eyeballing of your spreadsheets. if it was mine, i would at least standardize the two spreadsheets so that they contain the same information for corresponding columns. that way, if there is additional information in one spreadsheet, i would put it at the end. it makes comparing the differences slightly better.

[20:04:50] <riv> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BstloCx8KDk
[20:05:05] <isekaijin> XCode: I don't see why.
[20:05:22] <XCode> denote the maps by A -> B -> C
[20:05:26] <isekaijin> Even if we're working in the category of groups.
[20:05:29] <XCode> and A -> D and D -> C

[20:05:55] <isekaijin> Take your favorite diagram in the category of sets where the vertical arrow isn't surjective, and then apply the free group functor.
[20:05:55] <XCode> let d in D then take the map going to C

[20:06:31] <riv> my problem is without replacement, so maybe a bit harder?
[20:06:35] <qedo> riv:  yes its a bit different
[20:06:43] <qedo> the math is similar
[20:06:48] <riv> ok cool

[20:07:19] <brownorange> "It is not provable this sentence is an unbent fork"  If it's false, then we can prove the sentence is an unbent fork, but it's not a fork it's a sentence. If it's true, then we can't prove it else it would be false.

[20:07:47] <sek> you're asking if the vertical map is surjective in your link?
[20:07:52] <XCode> yes
[20:07:57] <isekaijin> XCode: Actually, even better. Let the three groups in the top row be all the trivial group.
[20:08:01] <sek> clearly not, even for vector spaces
[20:08:32] <isekaijin> XCode: And let the codomain of the vertical arrow be any nontrivial group.
[20:08:32] <sek> C^4->C^3->C^2 and then the vertical one is C^4->C^100
[20:08:58] <XCode> sek: what if the groups are D is H^{p,q}(Y) -> H^{p,q}(X)

[20:14:00] <XCode> sek: say that $Y -> X$ is finite and surjective
[20:14:25] <XCode> I believe this makes them both of same dimension

[23:37:21] <zeld> isekaijin: what about this solution instead? p(674) = 3p(674) because 3x674 = 2022 then p(674)=0
[23:37:50] <zeld> isekaijin: then we have p(0) + p(0) + p(2022) = p(674)
[23:38:19] <zeld> which is isekaijin  -2696 - 2692 + p(2020) = p(674)

[23:39:07] <zeld> so isekaijin p(2022) = p(674) + 5392 = 0 + 5392 = 5392 as final answer
[23:39:12] <Simplar> https://i.imgur.com/THjv9jj.jpg This is a graph made in GeoGebra. I have a couple of questions about it
[23:39:15] <zeld> the problem asked to calculate p(2022)
[23:39:30] <zeld> instead with your method I get as solution 674
[23:39:51] <Simplar> (1) Why does a line that passes through point I intersects the leg of a triangle exactly in tangent point of the smaller circle?
[23:40:07] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:40:24] <Simplar> (2) How is it possible that the upper triangle with the smaller circle in it is isosceles?

[23:44:38] <isekaijin> zeld: Your solution procedure is better than mine.
[23:45:16] <zeld> thanks!!! but thanks to your help!!!!!
[23:45:31] <zeld> I got into this by reasoning thanks to your suggestions :) so appreciated!!!
