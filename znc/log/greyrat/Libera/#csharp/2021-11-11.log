[08:10:27] <sysRPL> is this strange ... people selling 32-26 inch 1080p tvs for $20?
[08:10:50] <merced> "freshly fallen off a truck"
[08:11:01] <sysRPL> are tvs of that size actually so undesirable that people just want to dump them for $20?
[08:11:22] <merced> depends on the source
[08:11:36] <khanred> Stolen
[08:11:43] <khanred> Or used
[08:11:53] <khanred> Or both I guess
[08:12:17] <sysRPL> i see them used on facebook local, people saying the upgraded to a larger tv and are selling their old tv
[08:12:26] <sysRPL> near me
[08:12:42] <sysRPL> that seems like too low of a price
[08:12:45] <sysRPL> imo
[08:12:56] <khanred> idk
[08:13:14] <sysRPL> but hey, mabe the market is `over` 32" tvs
[08:13:47] <merced> iddk
[08:13:51] <khanred> if a 32" is below $200 new, what would it be worth in 5-10 years?
[08:14:01] <khanred> $20 doesn't really surprise me give that
[08:14:02] <merced> we got a 65" roku new at microcenter for $250
[08:14:27] <sysRPL> i usually only by either lg or samsung
[08:14:36] <khanred> and I feel like a lot of FB local market shit is just people trying to get rid of shit easily
[08:14:38] <sysRPL> not vizio or other offbrand stuff
[08:14:47] <merced> TLC roku TV
[08:14:50] <merced> tbh its awesome
[08:15:04] <khanred> My Vizio is fine
[08:15:12] <merced> havent had nearly as many issuse with the TCL as i havee with this samsung i have in my other housee
[08:15:46] <sysRPL> i usually have issue with my splitter or cable box, not the tv
[08:15:55] <khanred> I also like barely ever sit at my couch or use that TV
[08:16:10] <khanred> I just sit in front of my computer for 18 hours a day
[08:16:13] <merced> unrelated but i also bought an apple TV recently and it's great
[08:16:16] <sysRPL> my 3 input hdmi switched with 3.5mm audio extractor died a 2nd time
[08:16:30] <sysRPL> but there is only one product like it that i know of
[08:17:00] <sysRPL> this thing -> https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073TTS9QG
[08:17:14] <sysRPL> can anyone you find something similar?
[08:17:18] <merced> oooo even has RCA
[08:19:07] <sysRPL> i have a cable box, mac, and chromecast plugged into it, then the audio goes out to some decent desktop amplified pc speakers
[08:20:09] <sysRPL> this is for the tv i mounted on a pole in an empty window separating 2 rooms
[08:20:48] <sysRPL> btw, has anyone discussed kyle rittenhouse today?
[08:20:49] *** Quits: Fiji (~Fiji@user/fiji) (Quit: Leaving)
[08:21:16] <merced> yes
[08:21:24] <merced> got into a whole argument about wisconsin law
[08:21:27] <merced> lol
[08:21:34] <sysRPL> i think he's guilty
[08:21:46] <sysRPL> and his story today was bullshit
[08:21:48] <merced> he's def guilty
[08:22:08] <merced> but the best we can hope for is 365 days of community service in the community he killed people in
[08:22:33] <sysRPL> he exchanged emails prior to that day with the store owner ... the store owner was asking if he would come and bring his gun
[08:22:49] <merced> he didnt even own the gun
[08:22:49] <sysRPL> and he bought the gun illegally
[08:22:53] <sysRPL> cross state lines
[08:22:57] <merced> :thinking;
[08:23:14] <sysRPL> and was brandishing the weapon at people earlier
[08:23:30] <sysRPL> people were arguring with him about him pointed the gun at him
[08:23:32] <merced> wisconsin apparently doesnt care for self-defense
[08:23:36] <sysRPL> it's on video
[08:23:37] <merced> even if he was carrying illegally
[08:24:14] <sysRPL> they were arguing with kyle about kyle pointing his ar-15 at them
[08:24:29] <sysRPL> he wasn't an emt
[08:24:34] <sysRPL> he was larping
[08:24:45] <sysRPL> after curfew
[08:25:26] <sysRPL> looking for a reason to have his gun out and impose some kind of fear among the other people out that night
[08:25:47] <sysRPL> then he ends up killing 3 people, fleeing and not reporting anything to the police
[08:25:54] <khanred> idk why this even becomes a national thing
[08:25:55] <sysRPL> they had to find him days later
[08:25:59] <khanred> Just throw the asshole in prison and move on
[08:26:08] <sysRPL> well, he needs to have a trial
[08:26:22] <sysRPL> unfortunately the judge is in the tank for the defense
[08:26:22] <khanred> Yeah but not every national news channel needs to cover it
[08:26:37] <merced> well its a national thing but
[08:26:41] <merced> wisconsin law is pretty cleaer
[08:26:42] <khanred> I also only vaguely remember what he did
[08:26:52] <merced> dude's gonna get off with community service and some probation
[08:27:16] <sysRPL> khanred: he shot and killed 3 people with an illegally purchased firearm across state lines and fled
[08:27:34] <merced> no only 2 of them died
[08:27:43] <merced> the other is attempted first-degree homicide
[08:27:47] <merced> lol
[08:28:11] <sysRPL> okay, killing 2 wounding another
[08:28:30] <merced> :P
[08:28:57] <merced> i'm burned out on this topic
[08:29:08] <sysRPL> the republicans around this country are assholes and try to `fix` things their way
[08:29:17] <khanred> I just have stopped paying attention to the news
[08:29:32] <khanred> It's pretty great
[08:30:14] <sysRPL> here in florida we voted, even break the new 60% needed to pass amendment, to allow ex-convicts to restore their voting rights
[08:30:56] <sysRPL> then the republican controlled state government just decided to not allow them to vote anyways, even though the amendment pass with 65%
[08:31:28] <khanred> You're free to vote for what the government wants
[08:31:56] <sysRPL> in utah they voted to allow a council to create districts, then the republican controlled state government ignored that vote and carved up the peopulation centers with more democratic votes
[08:32:17] <khanred> The Republicans are trying to redistrict the state here again
[08:32:22] <merced> weird its almost like our votes dont matter
[08:32:31] <khanred> Because they need ot win more than they already win all of the time
[08:35:33] <sysRPL> they have gerry mandering, voter redistricting, and then when they lose they claim voter fraud without evidence, storm the capitol, and start trying to come up with new voter restriction laws at the state level
[08:35:51] <khanred> pretty great
[08:35:58] <sysRPL> i am not a fan of most of the democrats, but the republicans are jsut plain evil
[08:36:15] <khanred> I fucking hate both parties but the Republicans are worse
[08:36:46] <khanred> When I vote I'm just voting for whatever damage is going to be the most tolerable
[08:36:58] <merced> #BigBirdForSenate2022
[08:36:59] <khanred> So dems usually
[08:37:00] <sysRPL> trump just does to show that the vast majority of replican politicians don't give a shit about anything other than wining re-election
[08:37:17] <sysRPL> * goes
[08:38:01] <sysRPL> i am pro single payer, pro free college, pro green energy
[08:38:26] <sysRPL> and the republicans absolutely hate al that shit ... they can't have educated voters
[08:38:26] <khanred> I'm pro one of those things
[08:38:40] <khanred> I generally don't believe in positive rights
[08:38:44] <sysRPL> why no a single payer option?
[08:38:57] <khanred> I'm on the fence about single payer
[08:39:01] <sysRPL> why no free community college?
[08:39:11] <sysRPL> i want single payer as an OPTION
[08:39:13] *** Quits: BSaboia (~bsaboia@177.37.198.83) (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[08:39:14] <khanred> Because these things need to be paid for
[08:39:14] <merced> the student loan bubble will collapse soon
[08:39:32] <merced> dont worry, we'll have cheap college soon enough
[08:39:36] <sysRPL> not as the only alternative ... as in, if there was a single payer options, people could opt in for it
[08:39:46] <khanred> Maybe, that's basically what Biden proposed
[08:40:02] <khanred> Which of course is off the table
[08:40:38] <sysRPL> a lot of these could be fixed by setting prices
[08:40:57] <khanred> I mean single payer doesn't work period without price fixing
[08:41:17] <sysRPL> and thegovernment could do that by saying to community colleges, sure you can get  lots of students, but here is what you get in $ for x credit hours
[08:41:33] <sysRPL> right now colleges are ass raping students
[08:41:40] <khanred> I know, I'm still in debt
[08:41:43] <sysRPL> same goes for healthcare
[08:42:03] <sysRPL> the government could fix all that by setting the payouts prices
[08:42:13] <sysRPL> brining prices back to reality
[08:42:29] <sysRPL> and of course, this could all be optional
[08:42:44] <sysRPL> that is, if you anted you could still pay for private college or private healthcare
[08:42:54] <khanred> fuck that
[08:43:02] <sysRPL> fuck what? private college?
[08:43:03] <khanred> mostly fuck private colleges rather
[08:43:30] <sysRPL> i beleive they should exists ... but it would be up to a student to decide if they wanted to go that route
[08:43:56] <khanred> I mean I have no issue with them existing, I just think it's idiotic unless you're rich or getting a free ride
[08:44:18] <sysRPL> we have 2 posh private colleges near me ... rollins college in winter park fl, and stetson university ... they should be free to be private
[08:44:25] <sysRPL> yeah sure
[08:45:19] <sysRPL> let them exist. let them charge whatever they want, but the government out to offer free community college as an option for people who don't want to pay out their ass
[08:45:43] <sysRPL> i think the same thing ought to exist for healthcare
[08:46:08] <sysRPL> and vision / dental ought to be part of free healthcare

[08:46:57] <khanred> If they can do this all without a significant raise to my taxes then I'd be fine with it

[08:47:39] <khanred> lol
[08:47:40] <sysRPL> vut defense spending

[08:48:07] <sysRPL> but a bit more fair
[08:48:30] <sysRPL> that's the problem ... walmart is unfair, trump is unfair
[08:50:05] <sysRPL> how much fucking money did the republicans flush down in iraq, afghanistan, the comanche project, the stealth projects?
[08:50:47] <merced> yep
[08:51:34] <sysRPL> the f117a was a complete waste of dollars. same with the stealth bomber. same with the f35
[08:52:37] <khanred> lol the dems supported the wars too
[08:52:45] <khanred> except a handful
[08:52:45] <sysRPL> $26.9 billion wasted on comanche
[08:53:08] <khanred> I used to work in defense aerospace
[08:53:28] <sysRPL> khanred: the democrats didn't go on sunday politics show every week to lie our way into a war
[08:53:54] <sysRPL> khanred: the democrats didn't make excuses for torturing people at black sites
[08:54:09] <khanred> like I said, they're slightly better
[08:54:58] <sysRPL> the democrats didn't hide the real cause of pat tillamns death and use it as a national propaganda piece
[08:55:56] <sysRPL> nor did they approve stupid nsa surveillance measures
[08:57:04] <sysRPL> one side, the republicans, are cartoon villains twirling their evil mustaches while making "muuhahaha" sounds
[08:57:24] <sysRPL> and the other side, the democrats, are useless people
[08:58:33] <sysRPL> but i'll keep voting for whomever has the best chance against the cartoon villains
[08:59:03] <merced> republicans win because they all represent causes that are overwhelmingly unpopular
[08:59:10] <merced> and they vote as a bloc
[08:59:25] <merced> unlike the dems, where we have the manchin cocksucker working with mcconnell
[08:59:47] <sysRPL> are you saying democrats `represent causes that are overwhelmingly unpopular`?
[09:00:13] <merced> nah, they just pretend to represent causes that are overwhelmingly _popular_
[09:00:13] <khanred> I voted for a Republican once
[09:00:21] <khanred> Because the other choice was a libertarian
[09:00:25] <khanred> For state auditor
[09:00:31] <merced> gross
[09:00:35] <sysRPL> merced: i agree with that

[09:06:21] <merced> weird
[09:06:35] <sysRPL> weird that republicans are racist?

[09:06:49] <sysRPL> sure
[09:06:55] <merced> ;P
[09:07:29] <sysRPL> i must have some magic field around me such that every republican i meet ends up confiding in me their inner most racist bullshit
[09:08:00] <khanred> Or you're white
[09:08:31] <sysRPL> i had to start at work with this mexican guy in IT, and not 5 minutes into our after hours work he confided in me that a black people wouldn't want to do what we were doing ... work after hours
[09:08:36] <sysRPL> yeha i am white'
[09:09:19] <merced> oh nah
[09:09:24] <merced> that's just what theye ddo
[09:09:58] <sysRPL> i guess they feel because i seem reasonable and helpful to everyone in real life, that i must also feel like them honestly ... that is that the darkies are lazy criminals types
[09:10:10] <khanred> .__.
[09:10:28] <sysRPL> i give off that vibe i guess ... i am on their racist side

[23:24:07] <bomb> if course it exists Miles8of9 what is this, Rust?
[23:24:35] <sysRPL> here is a video of my my improved vector / physics library with a catapult simulation -> https://streamable.com/w57iiq
[23:24:57] <sysRPL> and the source code -> https://gist.github.com/sysrpl/d57ab29bb7c64bcacb64c7d19ca4e072
[23:25:25] <Miles8of9> i was asking about a good library to use to implement a jsonrpc client...
[23:27:41] <ki9a> does anyone know if it's possible to start a Windows process (on .NET) and get the output as unicode?
[23:27:56] <ki9a> instead of whatever crappy charset is default?
[23:28:23] *** Joins: phrosty (~phrosty@c-73-225-175-19.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[23:29:23] <Suchiman> ki9a: if the process is outputting unicode bytes, and StandardInput happens to use the wrong encoding, just build a new StreamReader with the correct encoding over StandardInput.BaseStream?
[23:29:37] <ki9a> the process isn't
[23:29:44] <ki9a> i need to tell the process to output as utf8
[23:29:45] <bomb> sysRPL holy shit hahaha that looks awesome
[23:30:09] <Suchiman> ki9a: well that's up to the process then ain't it? not sure if there's any way you could force unicode
[23:30:13] <jonp> ki9a: output encoding is decided by the process
[23:30:27] <sysRPL> bomb: i am going to release this lbrary after i finish running it through the documentation generator and spiffying up the css
[23:30:29] <jonp> it could always just write straight UTF-8, regardless of "encoding"
[23:30:54] <ki9a> jonp: but surely console.writeLine(someunicode) does a conversion (in a sub process) to whatever the charset is ?
[23:31:25] <bomb> sysRPL it was a terrific demo. maybe you should present your stuff seriously this time, with a dedicated website and such
[23:31:25] <JakeSays> ki9a: no, it just writes what it's told to
[23:31:43] <ki9a> it can't. C# is unicode, stdout is "ansi"
[23:31:50] <sysRPL> bomb: i have some dedicated websites
[23:31:52] <sysRPL> already
[23:31:55] <ki9a> so it does something like getcharset to convert to
[23:31:57] <ki9a> and uses that
[23:32:02] *** Quits: SKull (~SKull@beast.darktemple.ch) (Quit: leaving)
[23:32:17] <jonp> ki9a: Console.WriteLine() will use Console.OutputEncoding to determine what to write to stdout
[23:32:19] <sysRPL> did you see my asteroids demo from the other day?
[23:32:22] <jonp> which need not be "ANSI"
[23:32:28] <ki9a> it's latin1
[23:32:30] <sysRPL> https://www.getlazarus.org/videos/physics/asteroids/
[23:32:30] <ki9a> on my pc
[23:32:32] <JakeSays> yeah that^
[23:32:32] <bomb> nope, no asteroids
[23:32:44] <jonp> ki9a: right, but it doesn't "need" to be
[23:32:47] <sysRPL> using the same library
[23:32:54] <ki9a> jonp: so I guess my question comes down to, cna I override whatever the "default" charset is for a subprocess/
[23:32:54] <bomb> so what's the name of the collection of your gamedev libs?
[23:33:05] <sysRPL> it runs well on a raspberry pi also
[23:33:06] <jonp> you can have the child process set OutputEncoding=UTF8, and the parent process set it's expected encoding to UTF_8
[23:33:10] <jonp> and then you have UTF-8 "everywhere"
[23:33:17] <sysRPL> this name is going to be Tiny.Sim
[23:33:30] <ki9a> hrm
[23:33:37] <jonp> the Windows Console subsystem doesn't care; it's all just bytes
[23:33:43] <JakeSays> ki9a: just switch to linux
[23:33:46] <jonp> it's basically an "implicit protocol" between parent & child
[23:33:50] <ki9a> so .net uses Encoding.Default
[23:34:01] <ki9a> which uses some windows api to get whatever "default" is for thsi pc
[23:34:03] <ki9a> right/
[23:34:09] <bomb> Tiny.Sim
[23:34:23] <JakeSays> ki9a: it probably interrogates the code page or something
[23:34:33] <ki9a> Thats where I'm going
[23:34:40] <bomb> it's a little underwhelming, but if it makes you happy... :)
[23:34:44] <ki9a> i want to start a child process with a different code page
[23:35:10] <JakeSays> then do it

[23:35:45] <ki9a> GetConsoleOutputCP
[23:36:14] <JakeSays> ki9a: i would imagine that'd only apply to console apps
[23:36:25] <JakeSays> so i'm assuming you're working with console apps
[23:36:35] <ki9a> relatively few other things in life have stdout/stderr
[23:36:54] <JakeSays> everything has stdout/stderr
[23:37:08] <JakeSays> a console app just provides a console to see the output
[23:37:58] <bomb> sysRPL by the way, I've been thinking wxWidgets would be a nice alternative to LCL for Object Pascal
[23:38:12] <Suchiman> JakeSays: i mean, women theoretically have stderr but they decide to never use it and instead write garbled nonsense to stdout
[23:38:23] <sysRPL> i wrote my own widget system for this library
[23:39:18] <bomb> that sounds like a full-time task. you're retired, right?
[23:39:24] <ki9a> I think I have an idea
[23:39:42] <ki9a> I can use SetConsoleCP to override the code page, then execute a sub process
[23:39:52] <ki9a> this would only work with a "real" console window though
[23:40:50] <ki9a> Windows sucks!
[23:40:52] <ki9a> thats it
[23:40:57] <ki9a> still using ansi in this age
[23:41:14] <Suchiman> ki9a: at least windows now has an utf8 codepage :P
[23:41:18] <JakeSays> Suchiman: they also have stdin but totally ignore it

[23:41:49] <ki9a> I like svelte
[23:42:06] <JakeSays> isn't it just another js framework flavor of the day?

[23:43:04] <bomb> it's "fuck others, I won't waste your time" kind of library. I love those libs
[23:43:09] <JakeSays> so yeah another flavor of the day
[23:43:13] <ki9a> It's codegen instead of magic
[23:44:13] <ki9a> Next!
[23:44:28] <JakeSays> ki9a: magic?
[23:44:32] <ki9a> vue, react
[23:44:36] <ki9a> they all work with magic
[23:45:13] <ki9a> react rewrites "svelte" js/ts into js that has plain update the dom logic
[23:45:17] <ki9a> no virtual dom
[23:46:34] <JakeSays> so react and svelte are related?
[23:48:43] <ki9a> they can do the same kind of thing
[23:48:56] <ki9a> they don't work well together or anything
[23:49:02] <ki9a> you know what react is though right?
