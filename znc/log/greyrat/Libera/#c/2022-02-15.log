[00:32:57] <calamari> I have a call to vsnprintf that is incorrectly using the first argument value for both %s's of "%s %s"'s only if another printf line is present in the function. If I move that other printf to its own function (forcing it not to be inlined), then the problem "goes away". Obviously, that's not a reasonable fix. My first thought was that I screwed up a pointer somewhere, but I've searched extensively, and even checked things with gdb, valgrind, etc, and I

[02:39:20] <Dean> caze if i understand correct. i stop reading input after 80 characters?
[02:39:34] <caze> Dean: No.
[02:39:43] <ChoHag> No you stop checking whether you should fill the buffer up or not.
[02:40:01] <caze> Dean: You only print lines that are longer than 80 characters.
[02:40:11] <caze> Dean: If the line is shorter than 80 characters, you don't print it.
[02:40:28] <Dean> ah, ok ok. so i take all of the inputs separated by enter key and then print back only ones of 80 length.
[02:40:36] <ChoHag> 80+

[09:36:36] <the_lanetly_052> Hi, does it make sense to use i & 0xffffffff instead of i % 0xffffffff to do wrap around of int32
[09:37:43] <dave0> the_lanetly_052: they are not eqivalent, but no, it wont work because 0xffffffff is not representable in int32_t
[09:38:10] <dave0> wait that's not quite right
[09:38:46] <the_lanetly_052> i meant using with uint32
[09:39:21] <sham1> As said, AND 0xffffffff is not the same as REM 0xffffffff
[09:39:22] <dave0> oh uint32_t yeah there's no problem with overflow there ... you don't need to & 0xffffffff at all with a uint32_t
[09:39:36] <sham1> You might need it with uint_least32_t
[09:39:42] <sham1> But that's not in use, so…
[09:40:49] <sham1> AND 0xffffffff is however the same as REM 0x100000000 for an unsigned integer
[09:41:14] <dave0> the_lanetly_052: c says that uint32_t is guaranteed to wrap, and & 0xffffffff is a no-op .. you may wish to use & as sort of documentation (eg. tell the reader that you're expecting it to wrap) but it's not required
[09:41:16] <the_lanetly_052> dave0: you mean that CPU does it anyway?
[09:41:47] <dave0> the_lanetly_052: c requires it, so it makes the cpu do it, yes
[09:41:51] <sham1> And depending on the context, I'd either use the reminder version or the AND, but I do prefer the reminder because it's closer to a modulo than an AND, even if the modulo would be compiled to an AND

[10:07:00] <caze> the_lanetly_052: Maybe try to understand it at the C level first? Then you can try to understand how various implementations use their native architectures to attempt to fullfill the requirements as dictated by the C spec.

[14:06:35] <fizzie> ^C is not EOF.
[14:06:55] <fizzie> ^C is a signal to terminate the program abruptly, and just kills it, and has nothing to do with the check for EOF.

[16:17:06] <sokan> b = a + b-- in my head goes something like: 3 + 3 (since a = 3 and b = 3 from previous calculation of the code), and then we have b - 1 (due to b--). So it's 3 + 2. And that then is assigned to b.

[16:20:24] <fizzie> Undefined is undefined.
[16:20:45] <fizzie> If you must have an explanation, clang -O0 on this machine generates from `b = a + b--;` the equivalent of `t1 = a; t2 = b; t3 = t2 - 1; b = t3; t1 = t1 + t2; b = t1;` which, if you work through it, will (if a == 3, b == 3) first set b to 2 (from the b--), then set b to 6 (from computing a + old value of b).
[16:20:51] <sokan> my logic isn't flawed I hope :S
[16:20:59] <fizzie> But that's just one possible thing it may do.
[16:21:57] <sokan> my own implementation is another possible one right?
[16:22:21] <fizzie> Since it's undefined, *anything* is a valid answer.

[16:22:43] <dave0> sokan: you could fix it by introducing a new variable...   c = a + b--; b = c;
[16:22:43] <sokan> so happy undefined will not be a valid choice :/
[16:23:15] <fizzie> But your "3 + 2" logic is pretty dubious, because the whole point of the postfix ++ is that its evaluated value is the one *before* decrementing.
[16:23:32] <sokan> I avoid ++ and -- alltogether personally. I only use them on while, for loops etc, for incrementing them as counters.

[18:41:11] <sham1> What do you mean "generate blank in this regard"
[18:41:13] <libc> oh my bad
[18:41:25] <libc> i searched in google a blank character in C
[18:41:38] <libc> i thought that blank != space
[18:42:13] <kurahaupo> libc: blank is a category that includes the normal space but also some others such as tab
[18:42:23] <NRK> isn't blank line just "\n\n" ?
[18:42:44] <kurahaupo> NRK: that would be two blank lines
[18:42:45] <NRK> or does "\n\t\n" count as blank line as well
[18:42:46] <sham1> That is indeed how I'd understand an empty line
[18:43:08] <sham1> A line is always ended by a newline, and thus for example, the last character of a text file better be a newline

[18:49:57] <kurahaupo> NRK: If you add \n\n to the end of a POSIX compliant text file then you've always added two empty lines.
[18:49:57] <sham1> No. %u is just an unsigned integer

[18:54:21] <sham1> There are some things you need xlib for (notably OpenGL) but that can be done while having XCB do the majority of the work

[23:11:15] <libc> there must be another way
[23:11:21] <ChoHag> There are many.
[23:11:31] <libc> yeah let's try those
[23:11:39] <libc> it's impossible that a book ask you to do things oyu didn't learned about
[23:11:46] <ChoHag> No it's not.
[23:12:01] <libc> especially a book with so many good ratings like 'The C programming Language'
[23:12:01] <ChoHag> That would be called a *good* book.
[23:12:26] <libc> so are you saying THIS what they expect ? explore other options ?
[23:12:27] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[23:12:36] <libc> yeah ... could be
[23:12:44] <ChoHag> They expect you to learn.
[23:12:53] <ChoHag> What you have there is an *old* book.
[23:13:26] <libc> ok .. let's learn
[23:13:37] <libc> what is buffering and why it responsible for this phenomena
[23:13:53] <sham1> So, C doesn't want to output every write to the output stream immediately
[23:13:59] <sham1> That would be wasteful and time consuming

[23:14:21] <sham1> I think that's almost always the thing that triggers a flush

[23:17:49] <sham1> The buffer is not full yet, nor have you encountered a \n yet

[23:18:38] <libc> after running the program i type random keys on the keyboard and then Backspace
[23:18:51] <libc> and after that Enter (ie \n)

[23:19:35] <ChoHag> Your terminal probably trapped them.
[23:19:44] <ChoHag> Did you see the character you pressed before pressing backspace?
[23:20:15] <ChoHag> It also sends things a line at a time unless instructed otherwise.
[23:21:00] <libc> no pressing backspace behave the same as out of the program
[23:21:04] <libc> it just delete characters
[23:21:11] * ChoHag sighs
[23:21:29] <ChoHag> Run your program. Type in A B BACKSPACE C. Do you see A B C or A C?
[23:21:34] <libc> oh no, the character is deleted
[23:21:38] <ChoHag> Right.

[23:24:32] <ChoHag> No, it's older than that. 70s.
[23:25:08] <libc> ChoHag: please elaborate on the terminal trapping thing
[23:25:13] <pragma-> For a more modern book on C, I'd recommend ,{knk}
[23:25:14] <candide> 'C Programming: A Modern Approach' by K. N. King (2nd Ed, 2008) is a recommended C book that teaches both C89 and C99. http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html

[23:25:34] <ChoHag> libc: Your 'getchar' function doesn't return until the user (you) presses enter.
[23:25:57] <ChoHag> At that point it returns the first character of the line you just typed in and you loop over whatever the terminal decided you ultimately typed as that line.

[23:27:23] <ChoHag> So your loop isn't running continuously, it's running a whole bunch of times in one go every time you press enter, and until you press enter the terminal adds and deletes characters to the buffer it's eventually going to send.
[23:27:27] *** Joins: tech_exorcist (txrcst@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479)
[23:29:06] <ChoHag> You can poke various bits in the terminal driver to make it send a byte (ie. return from getchar) on every keypress but that's not the default.
