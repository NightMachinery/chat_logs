[01:52:57] <Hash> Does anyone know how it does? I don't think it can.
[01:53:15] <Hash> Every bitcoin address is on the ledget, nothing is hidden. The trail is always there.
[01:53:40] <Hash> So when you are at the exit point, you know, trying to cash out your bitcoin, you get nabbed at that point.
[01:53:59] <Hash> So at some point in the entire chain, you have to deal with the real world. So how do hackers get away with that?

[01:55:17] <Hash> Despite popular belief, Bitcoin transactions aren’t anonymous. These payments are fully traceable on the public blockchain – and indeed, it’s even possible to keep an eye on BTC stolen following an array of high-profile hacks over the years.
[01:55:30] <Hash> What sets Monero and Bitcoin apart is the cryptography that’s used when transactions are executed. XMR utilises a technology known as ring signatures to ensure the senders and recipients of a crypto payment cannot be identified.
[01:55:39] <Hash> Hmmm.
[01:55:53] <Hash> So bitcoin is out. I suppose they convert BTC to monero?

[10:20:40] <SymbioticFemale> (Tor related)  For a "ED25519-V3" key is the Base64 encoding of the concatenation of the 32-byte ed25519 secret scalar in little-endian and the 32-byte ed25519 PRF secret. The ED25519-V3 format is not the same as, e.g., SUPERCOP ed25519/ref, which stores the concatenation of the 32-byte ed25519 hash seed concatenated with the 32-byte public key, and which derives the secret scalar and PRF secret
[10:20:46] <SymbioticFemale> by expanding the hash seed with SHA-512.  Our key blinding scheme is incompatible with storing private keys as seeds, so we store the secret scalar alongside the PRF secret, and just pay the cost of recomputing the public key when importing an ED25519-V3 key.
