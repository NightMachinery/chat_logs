[13:37:41] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, but you know, with direct seeding under cover (cover of chaff) irrigation is seldom ever needed at all
[13:37:50] <CalimeroTeknik> whatever the terrain
[13:48:29] <Joanna> Depends on climate
[13:48:52] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: there are places where it doesn’t rain very often
[13:49:14] <Joanna> I’m definitely a big fan of mulching

[23:24:54] <not_not> Yo
[23:25:25] <not_not> I was mistakenly given resistance to interrogation training
[23:25:38] <not_not> And i passed the course
[23:27:33] <not_not> Never even been to boot camp
[23:28:25] <not_not> But i got poisoned, had gun pulled on me and release the hounds at the same time

[23:29:47] <not_not> I have a really funny story
[23:44:59] *** Joins: Joanna (uid57472@id-57472.lymington.irccloud.com)
[23:49:10] <Joanna> not_not: who gave you the training?
[23:55:55] <not_not> Special forces
[23:56:33] <not_not> But they should have been in the special olympics it seems
[23:57:39] <not_not> They discovered they trained the wrong guy when i asked them if i should go to boot camp and join the army
[23:58:31] <Joanna> I was listening to a podcast today and according to the person talking , some countries are very dependent upon satellites for many things while others are not. It would only take one country deciding to destroy some satellites to make enough debris to destroy all satellites and prevent any new satellites replacing them forever.
[23:59:00] <not_not> Ahh
