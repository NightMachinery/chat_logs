[11:32:12] <FromGitter> <asm0dey> Hi folks! I have an issue: after installation of Spacemacs on my laptop with 4k display everything is extremely small. Is there any way to change font size to something bigger?
[11:33:08] <FromGitter> <asm0dey> After usual emacs installation (without anything installed on top) there is a meu which allows changing both font and it's size, but with spacemacs installed there is no such a thing

[15:09:32] <FromGitter> <westrom:matrix.org> I'm on sway (wlroots compositor), so hidpi stuff seems to be taken care of by gtk for me. I still like my font slightly bigger than the default though, that's why I set it to 14.

I've installed a minimal speacemacs configuration on a vm to eliminate any of my configuraiton and customisations etc. I'm developing some Clojure code. When I view the 'goto' menu (SPC m g) I notice entries of the form <key> -> nil. For example, I have entries like d -> nil, i -> nil and t -> nil. This
