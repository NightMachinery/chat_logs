[01:13:08] <brigand> Hi.
[01:13:09] <one-star-chef> hello
[01:15:15] <ubique> Hello, folks. I'm not a native speaker and I'm trying to figure out something: a man who cuts stones is a "stone cutter" or a "stonecutter"? Should I use a space, and why?
[01:16:51] <Tanuki> ubique: Most dictionaries I'm looking at give "stonecutter" as the spelling, no space. Sometimes when two words are used together a lot, over time, they merge into one.

[01:17:18] <Tanuki> In English, this typically follows this pattern: two words, two words separated by a hyphen, one word.

[01:18:36] <Tanuki> There are also dialectal differences. For example, in American English it's more common to find one-word compound forms rather than hyphen-separated forms. In American English, you'd typically write "hardworking," but in British English you'd see "hard-working."

[10:03:10] <one-star-chef> Hello. I am not native English speaker. 
[10:03:47] <one-star-chef> Is there a word for a situation when someone is drawing incorrect conclusions about another person? 
[10:04:05] <Me-me> There are many words for that situation. What kind of a word do you want? Can you be more specific about the situation?
[10:04:28] <one-star-chef> Trying to figure out an example...
[10:06:40] <twb> one-star-chef: stereotyping?
[10:07:00] <twb> maybe "miscue"
[10:07:14] <Me-me> Mistake, fallacy, mischaracterisation... like I said, there are many words.

[10:15:22] <one-star-chef> Just imagine. Person A didn't sleep well last night. Now sitting at their workplace with eyes swollen, doing their job and not looking generally happy. Person B says to person C: Look at A, they are one straw away from a total mental breakdown, they are just a wreck, that's because their parents never loved them / they are on drugs / they are having terminal disease  ... etc. Similar bull**t, totally not true, totally made up. And
[10:15:23] <one-star-chef> totally different level of severity, because the person A is just genuinely tired, but fine otherwise. And will be fine after some good sleep. 
[10:15:52] <Me-me> Ah, hmm.
[10:15:54] <one-star-chef> What would be a word for such an incorrect conclusion of person B about person A?
[10:16:28] <Me-me> Assumption or presumption, "jumping to conclusions", depending on how much information the person has and what tone you want to set.
[10:16:39] <Me-me> Any of those three I think is appropriate here.
[10:19:52] <one-star-chef> And if B is trying to push anyone (including even the A) to think the same about A, what would be the word for that pushing?

[18:33:01] <brigand> +wikipedia Egalitarianism
[18:33:24] <brigand> Egalitarianism (from French  égal 'equal'), or equalitarianism,[1][2] is a school of thought within political philosophy that builds from the concept of social equality, prioritizing it for all people.[3] Egalitarian doctrines are generally characterized by the idea that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or moral status.[4] Egalitarianism is the doctrine that all citizens of a state should be accorded exactly equal rights.[5]

[23:15:54] <brigand> How do you call a person that claims to know: a knower, a knowing or a knowledgeable?
[23:16:15] <Babar> claims to know what?
[23:16:27] <Babar> if it is a specific fact, I don't think "knowledgeable" would work
[23:16:54] *** Joins: pntaylor (~quassel@101.113.78.104)
[23:17:58] <brigand> Claiming to know in general, as opposed to (just) believing.
[23:18:15] <Babar> know what?

[23:20:59] <brigand> It's not a specific thing. This person claims not to be dependent on believing.

[23:21:39] <Babar> the word used would be dependant on the context
[23:21:56] <mornfall> informed, perhaps? though it's not really about ‘claiming’ to know things…
[23:22:03] <Babar> for example, someone who does not know about God, would be agnostic (although I doubt someone who knows would be gnostic)?
[23:23:13] <mornfall> (another word that comes to mind would be expert)
[23:23:23] <Tanuki> Some people do use the term that way, but it can be confusing because there actually was a purportedly heretical movement within early Christianity called Gnosticism.
[23:23:53] <Babar> yes

[23:33:33] <brigand> "a person who knows something"
[23:33:42] <Bayes> brigand also educated
[23:33:43] <brigand>  Examples of 'knower' in a sentence knower    These examples have been automatically selected and may contain sensitive content. Read more…  The physiologists, he complained, 'in their attempts to penetrate the reality of the known, were deliberately ignoring the knower'.  The Times Literary Supplement (2014)
[23:34:02] <Bayes> "I've educated myself in what you mentioned last time"
[23:34:04] <darsie> Why is black ok but yellow or red is not? Or is it?
[23:34:23] <Tanuki> darsie: What?
[23:34:29] <Bayes> brigand also well versed, savvy, and connoisseur
[23:34:32] <Tanuki> Those are just colors.
[23:34:47] <darsie> Why is yellow or red derogatory but black is not? Or is it not?
[23:34:58] <brigand> darsie: It is.
[23:35:13] <Bayes> they might have slightly different nuances but they all mean that you're knowledgeable about something, and knowledgeable is also valid for this
[23:35:29] <brigand> Person of colour is the political correct thing to say nowadays.

[23:39:28] <TimMc> brigand: Just using "black" is actually back in fashion.
[23:39:32] <placeb0> if that ever changes we'll have some trouble describing kitties that are black and white without saying the word black
[23:39:45] <placeb0> TimMc: is it really?
[23:40:01] <TimMc> *sigh* probably depends on region and whatnot
[23:40:22] <Tanuki> Also, just as an addendum -- some style guides do recommend "Black" as the way to write it, with a capital B.
[23:41:01] *** Quits: jinsun (~quassel@user/jinsun) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:41:05] <Babar> funniest I've heard is "African American", especially when referring to someone neither African, nor American
[23:41:16] <placeb0> hopefully one day people will realise that it's stupid to victimise words 
[23:41:45] <Babar> as long as words can be used to hurt people, I doubt it
[23:42:24] <placeb0> you can hurt people without using the sensitive words
[23:42:54] <placeb0> words alone have no meaning or intention
[23:43:15] <brigand> African American is short for "American with African ancestry".
[23:44:29] <Tanuki> Right; hence, a person from, say, Uganda, who is probably black, won't be African American.
[23:45:50] <darsie> brigand: There are also non American Africans.
[23:45:54] <darsie> Like Elon Musk.
[23:46:05] <darsie> Well, he became American.

[23:51:25] <TimMc> hello, fellow fish
[23:51:52] <placeb0> I think the 'African American' describes a specific race and the origin is back when people from Africa moved to  America while there were no other civilized humans in America

[23:54:07] <TimMc> darsie: Good question on "black albino". In the non-linguistic sense, yes -- people with an African ancestry and who would otherwise have dark skin can have albinism.
[23:54:28] <darsie> :)
[23:54:34] <TimMc> Linguistically, though... I bet people would disagree among themselves. :-)
[23:56:11] <placeb0> at that sense everyone would be black if they weren't white
[23:57:33] *** jinsun__ is now known as jinsun
[23:58:04] <TimMc> Hey, here's a question -- have any of you encountered an unusual use of the word "syndrome" referring to like... geopolitics?
[23:58:40] <TimMc> I think it's an older usage that means a pattern of activity.
[23:58:42] <placeb0> do you have an example?
[23:58:49] <TimMc> I'll have to dig it up again.
