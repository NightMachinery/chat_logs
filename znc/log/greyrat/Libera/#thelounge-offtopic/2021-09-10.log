[00:34:20] <bookworm> let's do docker inside of nspawn for yet another useless indirection
[00:34:34] <Activ8> huh
[00:34:44] <Activ8> yaui
[00:34:45] <bookworm> if you don't NAT 3 levels deep you are doing it wrong
[00:35:00] <Activ8> doesn't matter how deep it is
[00:35:02] <abraham> Activ8: I would use something more robust like Squid
[00:35:05] <bookworm> /s in case it's not obvious
[00:35:26] <Activ8> forgot about squid
[00:35:42] <Activ8> whats /s
[00:35:50] <Activ8> what's not obvious
[00:35:54] <bookworm> Marker for sarcasm
[00:36:19] <Activ8> doesn't come up you might want to incorporate it into the next build
[00:36:51] <Activ8> ðŸ¤­
[00:36:52] <abraham> Activ8: you can use a consumer vpn with a proxy on a vps and get infinite proxied bandwidth for like $10/mo
[00:36:56] <bookworm> it's ascii text my dear, it comes up exactly as desired
[00:37:10] *** Joins: Vercas4 (~Vercas@gateway/tor-sasl/vercas)
[00:37:14] <Activ8> nope doesn't come up on my lounge install I see nothing with /s
[00:37:17] <bookworm> I'm that old, we had plain text emoji in my day
[00:37:23] <Activ8> lmao
[00:37:43] <Activ8> I'm been sarcastic but hey! like irc does a /slap we should do a /s lol
[00:38:28] <Activ8> . /s - ** Sarcasm Alert **
[00:38:28] <bookworm> abraham: what vpn provider do you use and why?
[00:38:46] <bookworm> I generally find them to be a scam
[00:38:57] <abraham> bookworm: honestly they are all sketchy
[00:38:59] <Activ8> I was curious that's all abraham just to see what people are using
[00:39:01] <abraham> i live in fear every day
[00:39:15] <Activ8> to be fair I just use my home connection, with static ip and a cloak from libera
[00:39:15] <bookworm> after all they won't actually hide your identity from any nation state and can happily mitm all your traffic
[00:39:18] <abraham> i have no clue who operates my vpn
[00:39:33] <abraham> but they live on a remote island i think

[00:39:37] <Activ8> you don't know who operates it but you use it? do you know the terms and conditions ? lol
[00:39:44] <Activ8> do you know if they are logging you?
[00:39:52] <abraham> I read everything 
[00:39:57] <bookworm> TOS == internet pinky swear
[00:40:19] <abraham> the best way to tell is to see what government requests they respond to and what data they were able to provide
[00:40:19] <Activ8> ha ha except the small print
[00:40:36] <Activ8> are you doing something you shouldn't be? naughty naughty
[00:40:40] <abraham> the one I use doesn't look anything, expressvpn
[00:40:46] <abraham> log*
[00:40:51] <abraham> besides connection times
[00:40:59] <abraham> minor metadata
[00:41:01] <Activ8> that's what protonmail said until they get told to hand over the data lol
[00:41:15] <Activ8> naughty naughty
[00:41:19] <abraham> at this point, i trust no onne
[00:41:19] <bookworm> considering that you can't actually validate this I'd take it with a ton of salt
[00:41:27] <abraham> but have few options
[00:41:37] <bookworm> Russian or Chinese?
[00:41:55] <abraham> british virgin islands
[00:42:17] <bookworm> apparently Russia wants to block tlsv1.3 , fun discussion in #linux today
[00:42:49] <bookworm> I mean the UK is a 5eye nation, but it ain't that bad
[00:43:02] <abraham> do you trust your gov/isp more or a random company based on an island, that's what it comes down to... i honestly don't know
[00:43:04] <bookworm> least they don't have an effective internet block yet
[00:43:17] <bookworm> minus the porn filter
[00:43:28] <bookworm> but last I checked that was built on DNs?
[00:44:32] <abraham> bookworm: what do you mean?
[00:46:09] <abraham> Activ8: nothing naughty, I barely use it, besides certain applications
[00:46:35] <abraham> it's a balance, I know I'm getting screwed either ways
[00:47:08] <bookworm> https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-porn-block-comeback
[00:47:46] <Activ8> I just like the saying naughty naughty lol
[00:47:57] <bookworm> the queen is not amused apparently
[00:48:19] <Activ8> well I tell you something, I'm shocked there isn't a better verification system in place
[00:48:46] <Activ8> you can literally twitter search porn and only fans stuff without even been logged in
[00:49:00] <bookworm> it's just a human body. You'll loose against the internet, just educate your kids for gods sake
[00:49:15] <Activ8> I'm surprised sites don't get told either lock the content for age verification or be fined if caught
[00:50:18] <bookworm> as long as the porn is "normal" (no underage, no animals, keep the hardcore out of there) I don't really see an issue
[00:50:31] <bookworm> kids need to explore sexuality eventually
[00:50:38] <bookworm> what do you think we did?
[00:50:40] <Activ8> that's the problem it contains animals and hardcore
[00:50:47] <Activ8> magazines, top shelf
[00:51:00] <Activ8> argos w bank
[00:51:09] <Activ8> but anyway enough of that
[00:51:14] <bookworm> animals? Highly doubtful as it's illegal at least where I'm from
[00:51:37] <bookworm> local laws and all, your mileage might vary
[00:51:42] <Activ8> I won't get into it then but it's google searchable
[00:51:52] <bookworm> that's true
[00:52:12] <bookworm> but you'll never be able to censor the whole internet, that's impossible
[00:52:17] <bookworm> think tor
[00:52:25] <Activ8> google has a lot to answer for and in my opinion websites that don't initially put the content be hide a log in
[00:52:45] <bookworm> heck, the kids I know know more of how the internet works than their parents... try to control that
[00:53:17] <Activ8> not going to happen, problem is all about the laws, restrictions and regulations in place and how much damage it's causing
[00:53:53] <Activ8> in the uk, they wanted to introduce something so people had to go to the shop to buy a card with numbers on to "input" into a verification system lol
[00:54:03] <Activ8> I was like WTF as if that's going to work
[00:54:58] <Activ8> that would only take 1 box to get stolen in a raid
[00:56:52] <eliocamp> Fuck, so the government expected you to walk into a shop to buy the "bean-flicking card" so you can jack it? 
[00:57:26] <Activ8> yeh seriously that was one of the proposals 
[00:57:54] <eliocamp> "Hello, dir Sir, I need one of those age-verification cards, please... if you know what I mean". https://i.imgur.com/o1u8rI6.png
[00:57:56] <Activ8> they wanted all adult domains to be .xxx tld
[01:01:28] <abraham> i mean china did pretty well, there's still censorship resistant methods like domain fronting and stuff but overall they've locked it down pretty well with their firewall
[01:01:55] <bookworm> they are annoying indeed, let's hope not many countries follow suit
[01:02:08] <Activ8> I certainly couldn't imaging the net that's restricted like china especially if that was world wide
[01:03:09] <Activ8> it's a good thing in some ways they not able to see the shitty content other nations see
[01:03:49] <eliocamp> Yeah, like all that pesky content about freedom of expression, liberty and stuff. 
[01:04:24] <Activ8> mainly conspiracy theorists and influences 
[01:04:27] <Activ8> lol
[01:04:51] <Activ8> and fake news
[01:05:04] <abraham> that's a small part of the internet unless you're on facebook lol
[01:05:14] <Activ8> it's all social media
[01:05:17] <eliocamp> Right. Only state-sponsored fake news and conspiracy theories. 
[01:07:31] <abraham> the entire internet
