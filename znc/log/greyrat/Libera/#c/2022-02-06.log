[00:08:52] <nitrix> I suppose on a system with virtual memory, any operation becomes "virtual memory management", so it's not an incredibly helpful term when taken literally. Neither conceptually, it refers to a computer architecture / hardware / operating system technique that programs are oblivious of.
[00:11:07] <nitrix> If you were implementation some kind of VM interpreter, whose memory can move around and you had some kind of lookup table for the relations, then I'd maybe say yes -- with the caveat that you only emulated it. Then if you used mmap/sbrk now it'd get more real.

[00:11:19] <ski> if the details of the operation doesn't really care too much about whether there's virtual memory management somewhere in the background, one could question whether the operation is (partly) about that

[03:00:07] <sham1> Alright, so an undelimited continuation basically stores "the rest of the program" as the state one returns to when invoking the continuation

[03:00:26] <sham1> A delimited continuation on the other hand is, well, delimited. It only goes so far
[03:00:31] <sham1> It can't time travel
[03:01:08] <sham1> With an undelimited continuation, you can move up and down the call stack and even laterally

[03:06:13] <DarkUranium> kurahaupo_: delimited continuations are a *more* powerful concept than undelimited.
[03:06:19] <kurahaupo_> Sorry I was confused by the neologism. "Limit" and "delimit" are not quite synonyms, but they're very close, so it's extremely unusual to use "delimited" as an adjective.
[03:07:36] <DarkUranium> A word from 1852, albeit not *very* old, is hardly a neologism anymore.
[03:08:10] <kurahaupo_> DarkUranium: A new usage for an old word
[03:08:12] <sham1> Delimited continuation are more powerful which is ironic given that the undelimited variety seems at first glance more general
[03:08:19] <DarkUranium> kurahaupo_: an old usage for an old word.
[03:08:25] <DarkUranium> "delimit" was never the opposite of "limit".
[03:08:27] <edk> "delimited continuation" is not from 1852
[03:08:33] <DarkUranium> edk: no, but "delimit" is.
[03:08:53] <DarkUranium> They're delimited in the original meaning of the word. Nothing new here.
[03:08:55] <kurahaupo_> DarkUranium: I'm talking about the coined phrase
[03:09:31] <kurahaupo_> Anyway, that's sorted, I'll read the Wikipedia page for details
[03:10:06] <kurahaupo_> thanks sham1, edk, DarkUranium
[03:10:07] <DarkUranium> kurahaupo_: it's coined phrase in the same sense as to how e.g. "red car" is. "red" is not a new word, and it's not used in a new meaning.
[03:10:17] <DarkUranium> Even if the concept of a car is (relatively) nwe.
[03:10:19] <DarkUranium> new*
[03:10:49] <sham1> Just under 150 years or so
[03:10:50] <kurahaupo_> DarkUranium: can I just quietly admit defeat please
[03:10:51] <DarkUranium> But yeah, what sham1 said.
[03:11:15] <DarkUranium> I mean, on delimited continuations being the more powerful concept.
[03:13:06] <ski> delimited continuations e.g. allow you to turn internal iteration into external iteration
[03:13:24] <DarkUranium> Can also be used to implement (far more naturally than with undelimited) async/await, exceptions, generators, and more.
[03:13:41] <edk> i'm not sure if it's really more powerful
[03:13:44] <edk> call/cc can do all those things
[03:14:09] <DarkUranium> edk: by the same argument, you can do anything without continuations at all (thus, no call/cc).
[03:14:12] <ski> (some library provides a `foreach'-type function, accepting a callback. with del-cont, you can now convert that to a stream, that you can iterate on with `for' or however you want)
[03:14:15] <DarkUranium> You can always reduce things to a turing machine.
[03:14:16] <edk> i mean, yeah, true
[03:14:21] <DarkUranium> But for the usual meaning of "more powerful", they are.
[03:14:22] <ski> edk : `call/cc' *and* state

[03:14:46] <ski> (with pure undelimited continuations, you can't)
[03:15:13] <DarkUranium> Also, you can trivially implement call/cc with delimited continuations, but not vice-versa.
[03:15:22] <DarkUranium> (just delimit the entire program)
[03:15:25] <ski> anyway, the main point here is that del-cont is often a more convenient interface for what you want to do, and are more easily implemented in a more efficient way
[03:16:36] <DarkUranium> Also, they compose much better IMO.
[03:16:39] <DarkUranium> Delimited, that is.
[03:16:47] <ski> (continuation stuff does interact with the dynamic extent of things, though, so you'll presumably want to coordinate with exception handlers, and other such dynamic resources)
[03:17:54] <edk> there's not really a sensible way for any continuation stuff to interact with stack-unwinding exceptions though

[03:19:20] <kurahaupo_> The wiki page is hard going because the examples are all scheme, and it's been a very long time since I read LISP - basically before the 1988 paper that introduced delimited continuations. Are they useful without lazy evaluation?
[03:20:04] <random-nick> scheme doesn't use lazy evaluation
[03:20:24] <kurahaupo_> So the resemblance to LISP is just cosmetic?
[03:20:42] <DarkUranium> Scheme is a Lisp dialect ...
[03:20:49] <DarkUranium> And indeed, does not use lazy evaluation.
[03:21:25] <DarkUranium> So your last question is a non-sequitor. Lazy evaluation has nothing to do with the fact that it's a Lisp. The two issues are orthogonal.
[03:21:26] <ski> SML/NJ and MLton does have continuations. and i recall seeing them implemented in a Smalltalk, maybe also Ruby. hm, Prolog too (del-cont)
[03:21:36] <kurahaupo_> The wiki page special mentions "If we replace cons with stream-cons, we can build lazy streams:". Is that LISP or Scheme?
[03:21:55] <DarkUranium> edk: pretty sure there should be, given that you can implement exceptions with delimited continuations?
[03:22:27] <edk> delimited continuations always have somewhere you can make them return from
[03:22:44] <edk> which would be very destructive if you'd just delimited the entire program
[03:22:45] <ski> you can build lazy suspensions/promises, and build streams out of that, in Scheme, just like you can do in many other languages. that doesn't mean Scheme, as a language, does any lazy or non-strict evaluation
[03:23:16] <edk> you'd basically have ended up doing that if you implemented co-call with delimited continuations, i think, and that's reasonable because if there is nowhere sensible for a coroutine to unwind to but outside the entire program
[03:23:26] <ski> kurahaupo_ : that `stream-cons' is quite possibly from SICP

[12:59:54] <dave0> copy the first 3

[14:50:45] <h4k1m0u> Hi, I came across a code in an xcb tutorial (xlib client: https://xcb.freedesktop.org/tutorial/events/) where the function `xcb_poll_for_event()` returns a `xcb_generic_event_t *` but that pointer is later casted to another pointer of type `xcb_expose_event_t *`. Knowing that these structs (xcb_generic_event_t & xcb_expose_event_t) don't have
[14:50:46] <h4k1m0u> exactly the same fields, I'm curious how this function is coded? Is it common in C to have functions declared to return a pointer to a type, but actually return another type? I have seen that with function accepting parameters of a `void *` generic type, but it's the first time I've seen this.
[14:51:10] *** zx__ is now known as kish
[14:51:38] <dave0> h4k1m0u: you would normally use a union for that
[14:52:13] <h4k1m0u> dave0, exactly, I've seen that used in SDL (with events I think)
[14:52:38] <dave0> yep x11 uses it for events too, but i don't know the specifics of xcb
[14:53:17] <sham1> Or something like `struct xcb_expose_event_t { struct xcb_generic_event_t generic_event; /* ... */};` and then if you have a pointer to struct xcb_expose_event_t you can also have that be a pointer to the first element of said struct, which in this case is xcb_generic_event_t
[14:53:56] <h4k1m0u> dave0, but if I remember correctly though in SDL, struct items are organized the same way as in the generic type which doesn't seem to be the case in X11
[14:54:47] <sham1> In fact, the way I described it is exactly how the event structs are laid out
[14:54:57] <sham1> So you have the generic event be a "header" for the rest of them

[14:57:22] <sham1> Looking up the exact layout is difficult at least in the xcb sources itself considering that a lot of it is autogenerated
[14:58:37] <h4k1m0u> sham1, I see, I guess it does explain why `xcb_generic_event_t` has fields `pad[7]` and `full_sequence` that don't appear in `xcb_expose_event_t`
[14:58:49] <sham1> Ye
[14:59:16] <dave0> h4k1m0u: i seem to remember there's a rule that if the initial sequence of members of the structs matches, you can access them through a pointer to either struct
[14:59:26] <dave0> not real sure about that rule though
[14:59:57] <h4k1m0u> dave0, that could make sense in this case as the first three field do match indeed
[15:00:01] <dave0> h4k1m0u: are you sure the xcb_generic_event_t is not in fact a union?
[15:00:52] <h4k1m0u> dave0, none of the two is declared as a union (both are structs)
[15:01:11] <sham1> dave0: it's not a struct

[15:19:15] <h4k1m0u> it would've made more sense. dave0: isn't what you talked about earlier called "common initial sequence" rule (came across it during my google search)?
[15:19:45] <dave0> h4k1m0u: that sounds like it, but i don't know the rule
[15:20:07] <dave0> i remember someone quoted the standard
[15:22:43] <dave0> h4k1m0u: there's a different rule that you can cast a pointer to a different type, cast it back to the actual type, and then use the actual type ... that would make more sense in this case
[15:23:25] <dave0> h4k1m0u: if get_next_event actually constructed an expose_event_t and just temporarily casted it to a generic_event_t it would work

[16:15:30] <fizzie> The "common initial sequence" rule only applies to *structures* inside unions, so does not relate to accessing `u.type` in `union { int type; struct { int type; ... } x; } u` after setting `u.x`.
[16:15:57] <fizzie> If that's valid, it's due to type punning and the first member of a structure always starting from its lowest byte.
[16:17:12] <fizzie> Ref 6.5.2.3p6: "One special guarantee is made in order to simplify the use of unions: if a union contains several structures that share a common initial sequence (see below), and if the union object currently contains one of these structures, it is permitted to inspect the common initial part of any of them anywhere that a declaration of the completed type of the union is visible."

[21:11:28] <acagastya> Hi, I have two programmes, main.c <https://0x0.st/oXN3.c> and notmain.c <https://0x0.st/oXNY.c> -- main.c prints some words to stdout and notmain is printing the command line arguments.  I think it is more of a UNIX question than C, but ./main | ./notmain is not printing output of the first programme in second -- any idea how to get that done?

[21:15:05] <nomagno> acagastya: ./foo | ./bar pipes the standard output of ./foo into the standard input of ./bar. Arguments are a different kind of input, and they can only be supplied by doing ./bar args more_args
[21:15:16] <nomagno> you probably want to do ./bar $(./foo)
[21:15:21] <fizzie> The Unix part of the question -- how to get the other program to print the output of the first one, without changing the programs -- would boil down to "how to pass the output of one program as command line arguments of the other", for which reasonable answers could be `./main | xargs ./notmain` or `./notmain $(./main)`.

[21:16:58] <fizzie> Yeah, I was at the last `or` when you mentioned ./bar $(.foo) and then spent a while deciding whether to give up or not. But it was already too long a comment to not finish.
[21:17:19] <sham1> One also must remember that one can have too many arguments if they use the subshell expansion

[22:58:15] <markand> o/
[22:58:41] <markand> I always wonder when is va_copy really needed, if I transfer va_list to a function, do I need in the current function to call va_copy before?
[22:58:44] <markand> example: https://bpa.st/PYKA
[22:59:13] *** Joins: Juliu (~Juliu@2a02:810b:c640:3ec0:206a:d63d:f8a8:ec3b)
[23:00:55] <fizzie> If you want to be strictly conforming, yes.
[23:01:59] <fizzie> C11 7.16p3: "The [va_list] object `ap` may be passed as an argument to another function; if that function invokes the `va_arg` macro with parameter `ap`, the value of `ap` in the calling function is indeterminate and shall be passed to the `va_end` macro prior to any further reference to `ap`."
[23:03:23] <fizzie> (Followed by footnote 253: "It is permitted to create a *pointer* to a `va_list` and pass that pointer to another function, in which case the original function may make further use of the original list after the other function returns." But of course in that case the "position" of the list will have advanced to subsequent arguments.)
[23:04:10] <markand> okay thanks, I'll update that
[23:04:16] <fizzie> For that example function, you can also just do va_start several times, rather than using va_copy.
[23:04:53] <markand> yep
