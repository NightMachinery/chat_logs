[04:43:09] <edrx> hey, any ielm users here?
[04:44:13] <edrx> how do you handle history in ielm?
[04:45:41] <edrx> more precisely: suppose that you were trying to learn something and after running, say, 42 sexps, in ielm you sort of learned it - and a lot more
[04:46:06] <edrx> how would you save these 42 sexps to your notes?
[04:48:41] <Catie> You could save the buffer itself to a file if you don't mind having the entire interactive session
[04:50:10] <edrx> this is trivial in eev - it enforces a style in which we save all interesting sexps in our notes, see: http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-escripts-intro.html#7 - but I would to add a section to its docs explaining that I never learned ielm properly but it _seems_ that ielm people would do something similar by doing the things such and such
[04:50:23] <edrx> Catie: that's what you do?
[04:50:41] <Catie> It's what I would do, though it's not something I've ever done
[04:51:16] *** Joins: pallas (~pallas@183.193.123.228)
[04:51:26] <edrx> do you have a preferred way to take notes of what you did in ielm?
[04:52:47] <Catie> Generally when I'm testing stuff out at the repl, it's either to get a feel for what I'm looking for, or to solve a specific problem. In the former case, the experimentation itself is the point and I move on without saving anything. In the latter, I'll reconstruct the expression in the buffer for whatever program I'm working on
[04:53:04] <Catie> I'm afraid I don't take many notes at a repl, so I'm not sure what would be best for your use case
[04:53:16] <edrx> Catie: thanks!

[13:57:24] <ane> uhm, with native compilation, why did I need to run src/emacs first after running make and make install, instead of proceeding directly to the generated emacs binary (on macOS)? native compilation is complaining it cannot find libgccjit *unless* I run src/emacs directly first

[13:59:08] <fedorafan> have versions of libvterm that are too old. If you find compilation errors related to VTERM_COLOR, you should not use your system libvterm. See FAQ for more details.
[13:59:12] <fedorafan> thats my problem
[13:59:14] <fedorafan> so no vterm :D
[14:00:18] <gnoo> ane: yes, you can use native_full_aot or something like that (check ./configure -h) so all elisp also gets compiled to native code during compilation of emacs. (although that may be a separate issue)

[20:53:21] <lisp123> grym: thanks, will check those out
[20:53:49] <grym> i was joking about vetnari-theme, but modus- is real and good 
[20:54:01] <edgar-rft> lisp123: just simply pull the plug out of your monitor
[20:54:14] <cvandusen> but not retro or monochrome.
[20:54:31] <hobo> i'm in search of high contrast themes
[20:55:06] <grym> in discworld, vetinari's coat of arms is "a shield, sable"; ie, black on black 
[20:55:23] <hobo> I currently use the high contrast theme in IntelliJ
[20:55:34] <hobo> and I've been trying to figure out how to recreate that in emacs
[20:55:43] <cvandusen> You can browse https://emacsthemes.com/ & see what strikes your fancy.
[20:55:45] <lisp123> grym: modus seems to be not monochrome

[21:00:41] <cvandusen> hobo: I was, but same applies. There used to be a converter that could generate an emacs theme from a sublime theme, though not sure how good it was or if it's even still around/working.
