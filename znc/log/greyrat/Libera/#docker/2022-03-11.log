[01:15:32] <Sven_vB> hi :) I'm using docker 20.10.12 on Ubuntu focal. I've set up a python:3-alpine to run a simple webserver on internal port 8080, and published it to 3080. from another container, I can download my test file from the webserver using the internal port number. when I try to download it using "curl --verbose http://127.0.0.1:3080/test" on the outer host, it reports connection established, shows it sends the request, then silence. after about 1 or 2 
[01:15:32] <Sven_vB> minutes it gives up. is it an iptables problem?

[03:13:12] <CRCinAU> so, question - is it possible to start / stop / pull etc via dbus in docker?
[03:13:22] <CRCinAU> ie to use dbus to control dockerd?
[03:13:49] <tabakhase> Sven_vB anything special on networks, wifi, vpn or there like? -- odd thing is if the backchannel would be kinda derpy it shouldnt even go t "established" as thats way into tcp already...
[03:14:10] <tabakhase> CRCinAU rewrite that question pls
[03:14:32] <CRCinAU> can I issue commands to dockerd via dbus on the host?
[03:14:43] <CRCinAU> ie to start / stop / pull etc
[03:15:16] <CRCinAU> it seems like all google search results are about running dbus inside the container - but not to control dockerd
[03:16:03] <tabakhase> i wanne say no... dockerD generally is used via tls/socket (and there are libs/"bindings" for many languages)
[03:16:41] <CRCinAU> yeah - I was hoping to use dbus comms like we do with NetworkManager / systemd etc etc
[03:17:45] *** Quits: tex (~dix@user/dix) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[03:20:08] <tabakhase> ye soubnds like lib/bindings - or for "just those two tasks" maybe even a somewhat-hardcoded http-call are more therelike...
[03:21:03] <tabakhase> https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/ and following
[03:22:55] <CRCinAU> ah - I didn't realise it was via http type stuff
[03:23:14] <Sven_vB> rawtaz, sorry for the delay. here's my docker-compose.yaml
[03:23:34] <CRCinAU> I guess that's something like a socket passthrough to a container 
[03:23:45] <CRCinAU> then communicate with dockerd via that socket
[03:23:50] <Sven_vB> tabakhase, it's a VPS or maybe even dedicated server. no wifi or VPN as far as I see.
[03:24:47] <Sven_vB> tabakhase, I asked our firewall admin and he thinks it's a problem with docker, not iptables
[03:25:37] <Sven_vB> the node image is the one in which I had run curl successfully
[03:25:54] <Sven_vB> rawtaz, sorry, forgot the link. :D https://gist.github.com/mk-pmb/0b1d19605b8ade4f081ace36b7d2e60f
[03:27:02] <tabakhase> CRCinAU when you want to controll the docker host from inside a container - yep, mounting in that socket is the usual deal ((just note the security implications as docker-control==root)) - for "from remote" you can expose it by tls(client certificates) or even "dail in" via ssh (there is a std-in subcommand) - then poke that api with whatever you want (((for a "pull", its a "create Image with 
[03:27:03] <tabakhase> sourceRepo" for example))
[03:28:51] <CRCinAU> tabakhase: thanks - yeah - we already map it in - but I slapped together a 'management' container in a bit of a hurry - and in part of that, I just mapped in stuff like /usr/bin/docker etc
[03:29:26] <CRCinAU> so now that something is functional at least, its time to revisit now time pressure is off and I can look at doing things properly 
[03:30:36] <CRCinAU> the big thing I'm trying to fix is error handling - like there's numerous examples of us having a container fail with an error like: ERROR: readlink /var/lib/docker/overlay2"
[03:30:45] <tabakhase> Sven_vB if "container-container" works id expect everything in there to be fine yea - firewall wise, "docker0 is just another LAN" and docker-daemon SHOULD have setup rules accordingly to also let replys flow (what kinda gets agreed by getting a "established" and not just a "timeout") - and if that route were entirely dead youd see connection-refused or there like instead... --- only chance 
[03:30:46] <tabakhase> may be that your pre-exsting rules collided/mess with what docker tries to setup... -> disable docker, reboot, iptables-save, start docker, iptables-save again and check those/paste em...
[03:30:49] <CRCinAU> when that happens, containers just fail.
[03:31:58] <Sven_vB> tabakhase, will do
[03:32:41] <Sven_vB> I can't reboot soon, so I'll probably continue that line of investigation only tomorrow.
[03:32:50] <tabakhase> CRCinAU where/when/how does that fail like this where? o.O ---- also aware of restart policies? (((tho, your error there sounds more "system-like" than "container-failed" o that may be entirely unrelated))
[03:33:14] <CRCinAU> tabakhase: I don't know - we haven't been able to get a reproducable test case.....
[03:33:19] <CRCinAU> sometimes it just happens
[03:33:39] <CRCinAU> we can fix it with a 'docker system prune -a -f' and then pulling the containers down again
[03:33:41] <tabakhase> Sven_vB reboot is maybe a bit bonus to get a clean slate - if you can just stopping docker, ideally reloading/restarting your firewall or whatever is more than fine too i guess 
[03:33:46] <CRCinAU> but right now, that's a manual effort
[03:34:24] <CRCinAU> This was logged in 2017 - and it seems to be the same problem -> https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35747 
[03:34:46] <Sven_vB> tabakhase, I'm not sure whether it's safe to unload any firewall rules as long as certain services are running, and currently we need them up.
[03:36:20] <rawtaz> Sven_vB: did you verify that you get a request in the web server log in the container?
[03:36:59] <rawtaz> if curl reports connection successful for a tcp connection, shouldnt then the network connectivity work, i wonder?
[03:37:11] <rawtaz> if so, it *could* be a problem with your web server, whatever that would be
[03:39:04] <tabakhase> rawtaz from his compose, python3 -m http.server --directory . 8080 with a bindmount - so doesnt get much simpler than that...
[03:39:13] <tabakhase> but... Sven_vB - maybe kick that bindmount out, start the thing, then make a testfile in there via "docker-compose exec" or throw something in with "docker-compose cp .. .."
[03:39:37] <tabakhase> would make like 0 sense why container-to-container works fine then, but one less variable...
[03:40:16] <xMopx> i'm running `docker login <private_fqdn>` to log into my private registry, but docker kicks back the error message `Get "https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/": unauthorized: incorrect username or password`
[03:40:34] <xMopx> did the login command change? why is it trying to log into docker.io instead of my domain?
[03:42:05] <tabakhase> xMopx http(s):// infront? (should work without just fine too tho o.O) - maybe tripplecheck your string there
[03:42:18] <xMopx> tabakhase: no https, just the fqdn
[03:42:25] <xMopx> well, the server is a proper one with https.
[03:42:51] <xMopx> hmm I think this is a Mac issue actually 
[03:42:57] <xMopx> i'm sshed to a mac when it does that
[03:43:04] <xMopx> but if i do it on the physical machine, it works normally
[03:43:39] <tabakhase> docker-for-mac changes a bunch of things indeed, think that even stores them in the keychain directly - usually its just json files on disk m( 
[03:44:19] <xMopx> can it be unborked easily? I'm doing this because i recently picked up an ARM mac, haha
[03:46:05] <rawtaz> tabakhase: how does it being a simple setup help him verify with certainty that the request is actually reaching the right thing? i dont get your point
[03:47:17] <Sven_vB> tabakhase, I'll try with some internal directory that ships with the python image. after all, it's not important which file I use for testing.
[03:47:48] <tabakhase> rawtaz as in that its plain python3 -m http.server elivering files from disk - ("curl /testfile") -- opposed to say trying to run his aplication and loading /login what may timeout cause php is busy trying to connect to mysql (as random example))
[03:50:34] <rawtaz> tabakhase: so what? how does this matter to the task of verifying that the http request reaches that http serveR?
[03:50:47] <tabakhase> idk about p3-http.server - but apache for example writes access-log only after the request i think, and "disrupted connection" logs ive only seen from nginx so far... ("disconnect before answer could be send" and such)
[03:51:04] <rawtaz> debugging is about verifying stuff :)

[16:35:38] <myselfs> (
[16:36:52] <myselfs> hi,how can I configure identd in config.js when I add --publish 113:9001 to run the container,
[16:36:52] <myselfs> currently the configuration is as follows:
[16:36:52] <myselfs> identd: { enable: true, port: 113, },
[16:36:52] <myselfs> Should I still configure according to this,
[16:36:52] <myselfs> https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/identd-and-oidentd#using-oidentd-to-forward-requests-to-the-built-in-server
[16:37:53] <GyrosGeier> the identd inside the container should listen on the port that you are forwarding the external port to
[16:38:12] <GyrosGeier> so if you map 113 (ident) to 9001, the identd needs to listen on 9001
[16:39:52] <myselfs> when I was running docker, I added 113:9001
[16:40:50] <myselfs> then the port of the config.js file, should I set 113 or 9001
[16:40:59] <GyrosGeier> 9001
[16:41:14] *** Joins: zumba_addict (~zumba_add@c-71-194-58-34.hsd1.il.comcast.net)
[16:41:25] <GyrosGeier> because the external connection comes in on 113, docker listens on that port on the external IP, and forwards to the internal IP port 9001
[16:41:43] <GyrosGeier> you could probably also use 113:113 and not change the daemon config
[16:42:10] <GyrosGeier> fwiw, an identd in a container is pretty much pointless
[16:42:22] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Quit: Leaving)
[16:42:30] <GyrosGeier> because the point of the ident protocol is that you can ask who owns a specific socket
[16:43:37] <GyrosGeier> if the identd is running inside the same container as the IRC client, the answer is going to be fixed anyway, and if it is a different container, it can't give a meaningful answer anyway
[16:43:51] <myselfs> I see here https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/identd-and-oidentd#using-oidentd-to-forward-requests-to-the-built-in-server which indicates that /etc/oidentd needs to be edited .conf,

[16:45:48] <GyrosGeier> ah
[16:45:59] <GyrosGeier> you can probably just omit oidentd
[16:46:04] <GyrosGeier> and use the builtin one
[16:46:32] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors)
[16:47:17] <GyrosGeier> basically, thelounge wants to pretend that there are multiple users on the same machine
[16:47:30] <GyrosGeier> and identd is built specifically to disallow that
[16:48:04] <myselfs> ok i see, that link tells three ways, i thought the first and the second were together, sorry for my question, thank you very much
[16:48:08] <GyrosGeier> which is why they configure it to say "oh, and if you don't have an answer, forward to thelounge"
[16:48:46] <GyrosGeier> ircd is typically configured to allow more connections from a single IP if there is an identd running on it
[16:49:00] <GyrosGeier> because that means that is a shared box and multiple people might want to run clients
[16:49:13] <GyrosGeier> then they all connect, and identd tells the ircd the username
[16:49:26] <GyrosGeier> and ircd checks that every connection is from a different username
[16:49:52] <GyrosGeier> that's a kind of trust relationship between the IRC operator and the shell server operator
[16:50:27] <myselfs> well, I try to understand it as much as possible, then I just need to change the port now, so that the port I mapped is the same as the one in the conifg file,
[16:51:04] <GyrosGeier> the port you map *to* is where docker expects to be able to talk to the service
[16:51:25] <GyrosGeier> thelounge probably doesn't run with root permissions, so it can't open port 113
[16:51:45] <GyrosGeier> but the forward is the admin vouching for the service

[21:02:33] <jr_web_dev> is that correct?
[21:03:28] <programmerq> you'd need to also explicitly configure a resolver in the nginx config. it ignores the /etc/resolve.conf entry.
[21:03:55] <jr_web_dev> resolver: 0.0.0.0; would be okay right
[21:06:09] <tabakhase> jr_web_dev truth is that nginx isnt rly the best suited there (it for example doesnt renew that resolve unless you do some hacky variable workarounds) - also ssl is still a bit cumbersome - have a look at treafik or caddy for something "more dockerish" - especially traefik can be fully configured "just from labels on other containers" and such magic :P

[21:13:08] <tabakhase> going "back to the host" is the IP your host has on the docker0-network interface

[21:14:07] <jr_web_dev> how would i check
[21:14:21] <tabakhase> some docker versions have a "magic hostname" that can be used, you can ship it in via env or even look it up ("parsing default gateway") and your entrypoint takes the nginx.conf.template and writes it out or whatever, sky is the limit :P

I'm using docker 20.10.12 on Ubuntu focal, with dockerized docker-compose = docker/compose:latest. https://gist.github.com/mk-pmb/0b1d19605b8ade4f081ace36b7d2e60f

[21:53:33] <tabakhase> Sven_vB dont have it in the first place :P - real answer is a longer story about signal handling... (your container likely doesnt "stop" but "gets killed after timeout" right now) fixing this has multiple paths, from hacky --init to shorter loops to actual bascript - (also use "docker-compose exec nodejs_debug" instead of mocking around with the autogenerated names :P)
[21:54:37] <Sven_vB> tabakhase, which signal will docker use to try and tell "sleep" to quit?
[21:55:07] <Sven_vB> e.g. can I make it send SIGTERM or SIGHUP?
[21:56:35] <Sven_vB> I should probably strace it to check which signal it receives

[22:00:09] <Sven_vB> same. guess sleep ignores SIGTERM when it runs as pid 1

[23:47:59] <Sven_vB> In the "docker network create" docs I found "com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4" but I don't really understand its description. will this define which IP addresses will be assigned to containers that use this bridge?

[23:57:03] <DoofusCan> Sven_vB: no, it's for if you have multiple IPs on the host. when binding ports for a container, that's the IP that will be used to listen on
