[01:14:48] <mooff> thelounge could be helpful in showing a preview for that
[01:15:51] <mooff> i suppose if i'm giving *no* content-type header, it's not the worst thing in the world for it to give up.
[01:16:18] <bookworm> it's the proper thing to do actually
[01:17:08] <mooff> i should be a good citizen and configure that.
[01:17:14] <bookworm> this ain't ##redhat anyhow ;P not sure why you paste a podman error in here
[01:17:57] <mooff> well, it was a tl related thought, and i assumed it had a text/plain header
[01:20:08] <mooff> johncs: the giving it a go may be asynchronous / asymptotically delayed :P

[01:25:32] <xnaas> ðŸ˜œ
[01:26:07] <mooff> i hope to reuse as much erlang / elixir code as possible, as i'm not fluent in writing it :P

[01:26:55] <mooff> and playing with phoenix for like 10-15 minutes a couple of times
[01:28:17] <mooff> but the client will probably be a greenfield endeavor

[01:28:57] <mooff> and using them as a starting point, like a boilerplate project
[01:29:06] <bookworm> sure, why not
[01:29:13] <mooff> xnaas: perhaps you could drive them from Python compiled for web / wasm

[13:08:34] <bookworm> johncs: thanks! Did you have a bad experience with vue in the past? You seem to be rather reluctant trying to work with upstream
[13:11:33] <johncs> bookworm: no, Vue.Draggable just hasn't had attention in awhile, it's been a year since a non-readme commit. There's also a very relevant issue from almost a month ago that wasn't commented on https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable/issues/1080

[13:26:37] <johncs> Jay2k1: the warning's only supposed to be emitted if `defaults/config.js` doesn't have the property. So it seems like an obvious thing to check: does your `defaults/config.js` have the two properties in it?
[13:26:44] <bookworm> Jay2k1: humour me, use yarn index instead of thelounge
[13:27:24] <bookworm> johncs: that warning is emitted if the key is present in the config but unknown to thelounge iirc no?

[13:27:47] <johncs> bookworm: that's right, and thelounge checks to see whether it knows about it by checking `default/config.js`
[13:28:34] <bookworm> sure: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/master/defaults/config.js#L160
[13:28:47] <bookworm> but that thing is there
[13:28:52] <johncs> it's under source control though, so it'd be pretty weird if it wasn't in there after resetting.
[13:28:52] <johncs> yeah
[13:29:29] <bookworm> my guess is thelounge doesn't link to the new binary though

[13:36:42] <johncs> Did you try the default config Jay2k1?
[13:36:45] <johncs> can do grep -E "disableMediaPreview|prefetchMaxSearchSize" ./defaults/config.js
[13:37:31] <Jay2k1> it's the same as the one linked on gh earlier
[13:39:03] <bookworm> hm, I'm out of ideas
[13:39:21] <Jay2k1> me too, except adding debugging to the code
[13:40:25] <bookworm> yup. We have a typical case of "works on my machine"
[13:40:47] <johncs> Jay2k1: I'd look at some debug messages if you wanna try. can add this as the first line of mergeConfig in "src/helper.js"
[13:40:48] <johncs> console.trace("mergingConfig", oldConfig, newConfig);
[13:43:23] <Jay2k1> huh, that spits out three configs.

[13:43:58] <johncs> Interesting, I get 2 on my machine
[13:44:06] <Jay2k1-demo> this will be easier.
[13:46:02] <Jay2k1-demo> ok, the first time it's being called it has both configs, the second time it only has mine
[13:48:07] <Jay2k1-demo> first time is called from helper.js line 130, the second time is from src/command-line/index.js here: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/a046bfe8d1d28d4b7b216b00e528acce6076aa5e/src/command-line/index.js#L37
[13:49:13] <bookworm> that just parses the -c switch, that's normally empty as far as the second param is concerned
[13:49:35] <johncs> Could you share the full output?
[13:49:47] <johncs> Can do: node index.js start 2>&1 | tee >(curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us)
[13:50:00] <johncs> (the tee is just letting you see whether it's printed everything)

[14:03:35] <Jay2k1-demo> johncs: https://paste.jay2k1.com/view/ab930cdc
[14:11:18] <johncs> Well that's very odd, it seems like the warnings aren't getting spit out in the merge function you modified, but that's the only place in the code that has that warning text
[14:15:02] <johncs> My hazardous guess is that there's another copy of the lounge's code somewhere on your computer and that has the problem. And node is somehow requiring it instead. Seems kinda far-fetched though, so take that guess with a grain of salt.
[14:15:34] <johncs> I've gotta get to bed, but good luck Jay2k1 Jay2k1-demo. I'll take a look in the morning if you add more.
[14:15:49] <Jay2k1> not sure it's worth the effort, it's just a warning
[14:15:56] <Jay2k1> it kinda nerd-sniped me though :/
[14:16:04] <johncs> haha for sure. I love good mysteries.
[14:16:08] <Jay2k1> good night
[14:16:20] <johncs> night
[14:24:48] <Jay2k1-demo> ok, it's the giphy plugin
[14:27:07] <Jay2k1-demo> it has this line: Helper.setHome(process.env.THELOUNGE_HOME || Utils.defaultHome()); // TODO shouldn't be necessary...
[14:27:22] <Jay2k1-demo> running this triggers the warning
[14:34:08] <Jay2k1-demo> apparently not, things seem to run async in startup
[14:34:58] <Jay2k1-demo> ok, the thelounge-plugin-shortcuts has the same line which then triggers the error
[14:35:08] <bookworm> XD
[14:35:15] <Jay2k1-demo> same author :P
[14:35:22] <bookworm> well, delete the lines I guess
[14:35:32] <Jay2k1-demo> [ERROR] Package thelounge-plugin-shortcuts could not be loaded: TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "path" argument must be of type string. Received type undefined
[14:35:34] <Jay2k1-demo> no good :P
[14:35:36] <bookworm> it shouldn't be mucking about there anyhow
[14:35:59] <bookworm> that just means we have an ordering problem
[14:36:12] <Jay2k1-demo> i haven't upgraded plugins in a while i have to admit, but it currently fails anyway ([ERROR] Received malformed response from registry for "thelounge-theme-material". The registry may be down.)
[14:38:57] <Jay2k1-demo> ok this is weird
[14:39:29] <Jay2k1-demo> so the line calls Helper.setHome. helper is defined as const Helper = require("thelounge/src/helper");
[14:40:24] <Jay2k1-demo> i added a debug line in thelounge/src/helper.js: 
[14:40:28] <Jay2k1> https://ja.y2k1.it/d5c76d2a500bf9c0/image.png 
[14:40:36] <Jay2k1> ...it is not being printed.

[14:43:42] <bookworm> I mean that needs to be removed from the plugin anyhow. If ot doesn't work without it this is an issue in core
[14:43:55] <bookworm> there's no way that this should be done in every plugin
[14:44:16] <Jay2k1> why is there a copy of helper.js from dec 2019 in .thelounge/packages ðŸ¤”
[14:44:39] <Jay2k1> looks like a complete copy of the thelounge tree in tehre
[14:45:48] <Jay2k1-demo> well, sorry for the noise i guess
[14:46:32] <bookworm> ah, I see what you mean XD
[14:46:45] <bookworm> good to know for the future though
[14:47:07] <bookworm> maybe yarn added it as it's a dep of the TL plugins?
[14:47:14] <bookworm> although it would be weird
[14:47:38] <Jay2k1-demo> i was already wondering how such a require line could even work with a relative path

[14:59:02] <bookworm> the plugin is buggy. Rather than importing internals of TL it should use the config passed to it https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/0fb6dae8a68627cd7747ea6164ebe93390fe90f2/src/plugins/packages/index.js#L48
[15:01:40] <mooff> plugins should be implemented as single files, where possible, and peer reviewed before updates are pushed
[15:01:58] <bookworm> they don't have to be a single file, why would they?
[15:02:12] <mooff> when peer review is accepted, the updates should be published automatically
[15:02:23] <bookworm> as for peer review, it was a person scratching thir own itch and playing around
[15:02:24] <mooff> from a central source
[15:03:19] <mooff> > they don't have to be a single file, why would they?
[15:03:27] <mooff> to make peer review, personal acceptance, and modification easier
[15:03:41] <mooff> they could be edited in real time from inside the client
[15:04:07] <bookworm> peer review can be done on multiple files just fine...
[15:04:41] <bookworm> and it makes no sense to make them editable from the UI, you don't do that with anything else either (although you could, after at least the client side stuff)
[15:04:49] <mooff> ack. yes.
[15:04:59] <bookworm> but you certainly don't want server side stuff modifiable by the user, that be insane
[15:05:11] <bookworm> it's called "arbitrary code execution" and leads to a CVE
[15:06:01] <bookworm> Jay2k1: wanna fix up the plugin(s) or shall I?

[15:06:17] <mooff> on our own servers, usually
[15:06:30] <bookworm> then you can also execute a TL upgrade on the server
[15:06:37] <bookworm> so just do that
[15:06:45] <mooff> arbitrary code execution of my code is desirable!
[15:07:13] <mooff> arbitrary execution of your code is desirable! once it has been warranted by at least two or three other users i trust
