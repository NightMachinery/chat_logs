[01:49:03] <SpaceVimBot> <Gerep> I noticed that it uses deoplete, which uses the deprecated godoce. Is there an alternative to gocode that I can use with SpaceVim?

[21:47:45] <SpaceVimBot> <HeyBanditoz> Anyone ever get `Renaming is not supported for filetype 'python` before? I have pyright installed, and my `init.toml` looks like this:
[21:47:46] <SpaceVimBot> <HeyBanditoz> ```toml
[21:47:48] <SpaceVimBot> <HeyBanditoz> [[layers]]
[21:47:49] <SpaceVimBot> <HeyBanditoz>     name = "lang#python"
[21:47:50] <SpaceVimBot> <HeyBanditoz> 
[21:47:52] <SpaceVimBot> <HeyBanditoz> [[layers]]
[21:47:53] <SpaceVimBot> <HeyBanditoz>     name = 'lsp'
[21:47:54] <SpaceVimBot> <HeyBanditoz>     enabled_clients = ['pyright']
[21:47:56] <SpaceVimBot> <HeyBanditoz> ```
[23:16:23] <SpaceVimBot> <HeyBanditoz> Nvm, seemed to have fixed it by installing neovim instead of regular vi
[23:16:27] <SpaceVimBot> <HeyBanditoz> vim*
