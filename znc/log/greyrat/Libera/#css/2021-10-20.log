[01:59:06] <nullbytes> Is it possible to have an HTML range slider with an infinitely small "step" or to calculate the optimal step so that sliding the range slider by 1 pixel always gives the most precise value for the slider's current position?

[02:01:03] <hmw[at]> Sure, I'd definitively do that too. I usually try to only use, what works in all browsers

[02:07:16] <hmw[at]> lol
[02:10:59] <nullbytes> Am I correct that the HTML range slider allows better precision when the screen resolution is higher, since there are more pixels to slide between? And at higher resolutions, a smaller "step" value is required to get the maximum precision? If that is true, is it possible to use an infinitely small "step" value or to calculate the optimal "step"
[02:10:59] <nullbytes> value for the current resolution so that the range slider's precision is maximized?
[02:11:47] <hmw[at]> It is about the amount of pixels the element has, as the mouse coordinates are integers
[02:12:35] <hmw[at]> If I'd need a high precision, wide range slider, I'd consider adding fine tuning buttons next to the slider
[02:12:56] <hmw[at]> or a fine tune slider next to it
[02:14:26] <devslash> nullbytes, will this slider have a fixed tange ?

[02:14:30] *** Quits: Gustavo6046 (~Gustavo60@user/gustavo6046) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:16:21] <nullbytes> The range slider has a fixed range but its width may change. Fine tuning is not necessary. I just want to get the maximum precision out of the range slider for its current width.
[02:16:25] *** Joins: Gustavo6046 (~Gustavo60@user/gustavo6046)
[02:16:42] <hmw[at]> nullbytes: more pixels = more positions
[02:17:02] <devslash> what you are satying doesnt make sense as far as what you're trying to accomplish
[02:17:21] <devslash> what is the case use
[02:17:32] <hmw[at]> use case lol
[02:18:08] <hmw[at]> devslash: Why did you even ask about if it's fixed? Are you thinking about rounding errors and optimizing there?
[02:18:30] <hmw[at]> Not quite sure, if it being fixed is relevant really. hmm
[02:18:44] <hmw[at]> Also. CSS pixels aren't screen pixels
[02:19:14] <hmw[at]> Furthermore, setting your OS Desktop DPI to something other than 96 is also problematic
[02:20:10] <devslash> im thinking of a slider with a range of say 1 to 1000 and each increment increments by 5 or even 1
[02:20:46] <nullbytes> The problem is if I set a "step" value that is optimal for HD, the precision is not maximized for 4K. Is there a way to calculate the correct number of "steps" for the current screen resolution?
[02:20:48] <hmw[at]> increments being an integer amount
[02:21:12] <hmw[at]> nullbytes: How about not setting a step size and use Math.round() later on?
[02:21:19] <hmw[at]> if at all
[02:21:22] <nullbytes> The range is a decimal from 0 to 1
[02:21:22] <devslash> I think I know what you need to do
[02:21:46] <hmw[at]> It would help us think about it, if we knew why you need to limit the step size in the first place
[02:21:53] <devslash> because its based on the resolution right ?
[02:22:34] <nullbytes> I don't want to limit the step size. Is it possible to have an unlimited step size?
[02:22:49] <hmw[at]> nullbytes: sure, just don't set any or something. Checking it rn
[02:23:11] <hmw[at]> step="any"
[02:23:45] <hassoon> block-ruby ? wtf
[02:23:46] <nullbytes> step="any" is what I was looking for! Thank yoU!

[02:25:18] <nullbytes> no it says "The default stepping value for range inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered"
[02:26:13] <hmw[at]> ok, my mistake then
[02:26:33] <devslash> thats why you should set the min/max range value dynamically
[02:26:46] <hmw[at]> wot
[02:27:22] <devslash> if you want a range with fine tune control, set a large maximum range and increment by 1
[02:27:31] <devslash> incrementing by a decimal value is weird
[02:28:14] <hmw[at]> not incrementing may be considered weird, also. I see those things as representing potentiometers. Naturally, I'd expect them to have a range from 0...1

[03:37:10] <hmw[at]> or an s-curve. Most change happening in the middle of the process might look nice too. So many options :) I think there is no "right" way. It is a design decision

[16:24:15] <DrJ> I'm stuck a bit on this: .grid > article:nth-child(1) {
[16:24:31] <DrJ> how can I make this ONLY apply to the very first article
[16:24:58] <DrJ> if you expand the minmax to like 500px; and then size down the window you can see it applying to the first article in every row
[16:26:20] <DrJ> just change minmax(200 to minxmax(500 to see the problem
[16:26:30] <DrJ> and hit run, of course
[16:29:22] <fakuve> Hi guys , so I got a problem which is closed to get solved , I just need some CSS magic , I am in need to create sort of a `Clipping Mask`? (I think thats how they are called in Illustrator) , for this two layers , meaning the layer `class="screen"` thatone I need it to adapt its shape to the next layer of buttons , so only the buttons do actually blink and not the whole background image .
[16:29:24] <fakuve> https://jsfiddle.net/xnt68739/
[16:29:54] <fakuve> Is that even possible?
[16:30:04] <fakuve> Thanks
