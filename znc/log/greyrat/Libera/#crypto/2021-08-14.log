[00:00:07] <woggle> replayer: Also, in the commercial CA context, it's common for a CA to be both a root and intermediate CA (e.g. "cross-signing").
[00:01:29] <replayer> how can i see that it is both? and in case it is also root do i still need to trust the parent ca?

[00:05:41] <ms7821> if you want a cross-signed cert, https://crt.sh/?caid=7394 is Lets Encrypt's root, cross-signed by DST
[00:05:54] <ms7821> (which expires next month, and will probably break a bunch of stuff)
[00:07:24] <ms7821> you can see the two certs on that page - self-signed and cross-signed
[00:07:35] <woggle> And you can see there are two certificates listed there, one which is a self-signed root certificate and one which is an intermedaite CA certificate. If you present the intermediate CA certificate as part of your chain from a TLS server, correctly behaving clients will not care about it if they trust this CA (ISRG Root X1) and try to use it otherwise in case they trust the DST root.

[04:42:18] <LTCD> Hey, in Introduction to Modern Cryptography 2nd Katz and Lindell PDF 72/598 I am struggling to understand the difference between the two bullet points, aside from the success probability.
[04:49:40] *** Quits: d1cor (~diego@179.63.242.114) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[04:55:53] <ms7821> so the contrast is between brute forcing the keyspace (expected to take |K|/2 attempts on average, has success rate of 100%) and guessing a key from the keyspace (obviously only takes 1 attempt, but has a success rate of 1/|K|)
[04:57:42] <ms7821> brute force is the most common one talked about, and is usually how people reason about key strength
[04:58:13] <ms7821> the key guessing becomes important when you look at amorised attacks, where you can make maybe log |K| guesses but get a higher probability of success than expected, because there's a weakness in how the keys are distributed
[04:59:15] <ms7821> or maybe you can test many keys very quickly against a large set of ciphertexts, and if that set's larger it makes your work more efficient
[04:59:27] <ms7821> (this is the principle hashcat works on)
[05:01:18] <ms7821> amortised*
[05:06:02] <LTCD> Sory was AFK
[05:06:05] <LTCD> Sorry(
[05:09:17] <LTCD> ms7821 So bullet point 1 is brute forcing the keyspace which is expected to take |K|/2 attempts on average but has success rate of 100%. The bullet point 2 says guessing the correct key from the keyspace only takes one attempt but probability is 1/|K|
[05:11:33] <ms7821> yeh
[05:11:52] <LTCD> What are amortised attacks?
[05:12:29] <ms7821> where you save effort in the long term, even though each operation might be less effective on its own
[05:13:43] *** Joins: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy)
[05:13:49] <ms7821> so like guessing a key with probability 1/|K| is pretty useless, but if there are √|K| keys, and you can test them all reasonably quickly, you've got something interesting
[05:14:28] <ms7821> I can't think of a good example, maybe someone else can
[05:17:36] <LTCD> Much appreciated.
[05:18:21] <LTCD> I guess Rainbow Tables, as in the short term they waste time and resources to generate, but at the key cracking stage help.
[05:20:29] <ms7821> yeah, they're the same thing. you can think of passwords as encrypting a constant value with a key that is the password
[05:22:17] <ms7821> so having something that gives you a 1/10000 chance of guessing a password isn't much help, but if there are 1000 users you can try it for given the same effort, they're in trouble

[05:38:51] <LTCD> Hey. Introduction to Modern Cryptography 2nd edition by Katz and Lindell PDF 73/598, what is l(n) meant to mean?
[05:38:57] *** Joins: ses (uid38151@id-38151.stonehaven.irccloud.com)
[05:39:10] <LTCD> I know n is the security parameter. 
[05:46:05] <LTCD> This is the definition from the book: If (Gen, Enc, Dec) is such that for k output by Gen(1^n), algorithm Enc_k is only defined for messages m ∈ {0, 1}^(ℓ(n)), then we say that (Gen, Enc, Dec) is a fixed-length private-key encryption scheme for messages of length ℓ(n). My question is what does l(n) mean, and what do they mean by fixed length
[05:46:05] <LTCD> scheme?
[05:51:41] <LTCD> ms7821 Still here bro?
[05:51:58] <int-e> So it has no particular meanin, it's just a function that determines the messae length in terms of the security parameter (so it's only fixed once you decide which security parameter to use)
[05:52:11] <int-e> g? hmm, still works
[05:54:03] <LTCD> int-e So every input and output is l(n) is length, where l is a function?
[05:54:53] <int-e> This dependency is necessary in theory at least; you can't get more than log_2((2^l)!) = O(l 2^l) bits of security out of messages of length l.
[05:54:56] <LTCD> l(1024) outputs maximum supported length for this fixed length scheme.
[05:56:04] <int-e> Yes, all messages are l(n) in size. And you never change n.
[05:57:59] <LTCD> Also, on that same page 73/598 in the PDF, are stateless schemes just defined as (Enc, Dec) without Gen?
[05:58:27] <int-e> I don't have the book.

[20:15:16] <xenoterracide> so I'm looking at doing this gpgp :p thing again, because it looks like it will be much easier for me to security store my master key now in case I do something stupid to my computer. I'm planning on storing it in bitwarden (which is also doing MFA). My question is, if I do that, how long (max?) would people recommend I make the life of the master key? Also I've been noticing a lot of android mail clients support openpgp, 
[20:15:18] <xenoterracide> but not gpg directly. I know I can export my signing keys, but I'm actually wondering if there's a good client on linux for both CLI (for commit and such) signing as well as something for email, that uses openpgp so I don't have to do the export thing.
[20:15:51] <xenoterracide> Oh, and I'm wondering if I should export a different signing key to my mobile device than my desktop email signing and maybe my git signing key
[20:16:05] <xenoterracide> lol, sorry lot of questions
