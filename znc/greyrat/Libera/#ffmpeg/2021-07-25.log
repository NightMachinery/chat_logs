[04:06:08] <Atsuko> hey all
[04:06:54] <Atsuko> im demuxing the video track from a .m2ts file, the output track has a Menu in the media info "Service provider : FFmpeg"
[04:07:19] <Atsuko> how can i remove this? i demuxed with -dn and also -map_metadata -1

[04:08:59] <Atsuko> https://i.imgur.com/5ywjW6q.png
[04:09:17] <Atsuko> also this menu is not present in the source file, so it's has been added by ffmpeg somehow
[04:10:21] <Atsuko> ffmpeg -i 00000.m2ts -vcodec copy -an -sn -dn -map_metadata -1 00000_Video.m2ts
[04:10:26] <Atsuko> doing this, any ideas?
[04:10:39] <furq> you can't remove it but you can set it to something other than ffmpeg
[04:10:50] <furq> -metadata service_provider=foo

[04:11:24] <furq> maybe setting it to an empty string will work
[04:11:26] <Atsuko> why does it exist?
[04:11:58] <Atsuko> i don't really mind it being there, im gonna encode from it to another format later, i just wanted to get a clean dump of the video track
[04:12:01] <furq> some stuff requires an SDT
[04:12:04] <Atsuko> but i thought -dn would remove it
[04:12:09] <Atsuko> ahh ok, no biggie then
[04:12:12] <furq> -dn removes data tracks

[05:58:24] <Guest72> Does anyone have same problem? https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/9346
[05:59:22] <BtbN> You cannot read mp4 files as stream. It needs to be seekable.
[06:00:43] <Guest72> but i have tried from stdin, it works too. stdin is not seekable,right?
[06:01:14] <BtbN> define from stdin
[06:01:38] <BtbN> If you did something like ffmpeg -i /dev/stdin ... <somefile.mp4, that will very much be seekable
[06:02:14] <Guest72> i mean cat 1.mp4| ffmpeg -i - -c copy out.mkv
[06:02:25] <BtbN> No idea how smart shells are
[06:02:36] <BtbN> if it optimized to attaching the file to the stdin fd, it's still seekable
[06:02:46] <Guest72> and i have also tried tcp socket
[06:02:52] <Guest72> it works too
[06:03:18] <BtbN> It's a simple fact of matter that to play an mp4 file, and same for a lot of other containers, random access is required
[06:03:22] *** Joins: TanoMarcelo (~TanoMarce@179.63.242.126)
[06:03:38] <BtbN> mp4 needs it even more than other containers, since the usual location of crucial information to play it back is at the very end of the file
[06:04:51] <Guest72> I know, but thy tcp socket works, unix socket doesn't?
[06:05:04] <BtbN> I see no reason why and how a tcp socket would work either
