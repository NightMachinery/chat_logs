[00:21:40] <Fenderbassist> I was recommending that to Satin yesterday

[00:23:02] <Llamamoe> Satin: Ah that's unfortunate. For me it eliminates a lot of fear and much anxiety, but definitely doesn't eliminate e.g. worry or avoidance 
[00:23:04] <Llamamoe> IDK if benzos do that 
[00:23:51] <Llamamoe> Fenderbassist: Honestly, I think I'd personally search for and go with whatever a recent review about its medicinal uses says. Whatever that is. 
[00:24:31] <Llamamoe> I believe it's largely free of serious drawbacks but hm, idk. My gut feeling says "but is it really?"

[00:59:03] <snake> lastonestanding, why tho
[00:59:09] <snake> i know you want it to be 50/50 but WHY
[00:59:10] * emmeka checks on ##anime, sees toxic misogyny
[00:59:44] <snake> i accidentally quit
[01:00:07] <lastonestanding> because 50/50 is simply better than 99/1
[01:00:24] <emmeka> lastonestanding as to why "women won't work in the trades", there are better answers than "because feminists don't want real equality!!!!"
[01:00:26] <snake> 50+50 is 100 and 99+1 is 100
[01:00:29] <snake> hence, not better
[01:01:07] <snake> if you call this real equality then perhaps feminists dont want it, well its understandable, brick laying is a shit job LOL
[01:01:08] <lastonestanding> better as in equal
[01:01:18] <snake> i mean maybe its shit, maybe its fine
[01:01:31] <lastonestanding> aha
[01:01:31] <snake> guess it depends on the person but im not very interested in bricks or blocks
[01:01:48] <emmeka> lastonestanding the better answers are that these are industries with an apprenticeship model and those apprenticeships are by and large conducted by people hostile to having women in the trades, and treat them as inferior in the workplace.
[01:01:54] <MootPoot> emmeka: hey - is my answer misogyny too??
[01:01:57] <emmeka> if they hire them at all.
[01:02:00] <emmeka> which is rarely.
[01:02:00] <Llamamoe> It also completely disregards the fact that culture of a given trade and society's attitude towards are the two top reasons why gender inequality in different jobs is a thing
[01:02:19] <lastonestanding> but this could be changed
[01:02:28] <emmeka> it could be, and is, slowly.
[01:02:32] <Llamamoe> Like female bricklayers would be harassed by their male colleagues most of the time, and basically everyone they know would look at them wrong 
[01:02:40] <lastonestanding> laws could help
[01:02:46] <emmeka> there are more women in trades than there were 10 years ago, and much more than there were 20 years ago, so on
[01:03:10] <emmeka> lastonestanding yes, they could, and many labour unions fight for such laws.
[01:03:11] <Llamamoe> When it comes to high profile jobs like STEM, the barriers to entry represent pretty major inequality of opportunity, so it kinda makes sense

[01:04:25] <lastonestanding> one area I'm not too sure about is elementary school teachers
[01:04:26] <emmeka> progress is uneven across the industries. progress towards gender equity has been most rapid in places where women were already present in the workplace in reduced capacities, ie, mostly white collar workplaces.
[01:04:34] <lastonestanding> the vast majority is female
[01:04:41] <emmeka> lastonestanding also, increasingly male.
[01:05:40] <emmeka> it sounds like, as much as you don't like the way I'd phrase it, that your complaint is that feminism is not advancing through the world fast enough or making gains quick enough :P
[01:05:55] <lastonestanding> men interacting with young children, mmh

[01:10:05] <emmeka> I mean there are people campaigning for such things
[01:10:13] <Llamamoe> Urchin[emacs]: Is that the maid from Black Lagoon? 
[01:10:13] <emmeka> see: every major progressive labour union ever
[01:10:28] <emmeka> gender equity is like a major thing of the labour movement and all
[01:10:30] <snake> emmeka, for example?
[01:10:38] <lastonestanding> emmeka: even women campaign for it?
[01:11:01] <emmeka> snake you want an example of a labour union that campaigns for equal opportunity for women within the trades
[01:11:06] <emmeka> I mean, do I have to
[01:11:11] <emmeka> it should be self-evident
[01:11:37] <emmeka> lastonestanding at least in North America, union rank and file is overwhelmingly female, so yes.
[01:11:44] <snake> yeah perhaps i can imagine it, the few women who are in such trades might want more females on their team and in their union
[01:12:10] <snake> just seems like a strange thing to aspire to when you call it "brick laying"
[01:12:12] <emmeka> snake well it's more like these women face discrimination within their industry and want to rectify it so they have the same chances to succeed as men.
[01:13:02] <snake> what might also seem strainge: more female trash women, more female oil riggers, more female soldiers, more male prostitutes
[01:13:09] <Llamamoe> Honestly, I think a lot of rhetoric like lastonestanding's is down to the fact that people's perception is relative to present circumstances, and people instinctively want to peddle rhetoric that gives or maintains their advantage in society.

[09:04:50] <DunceCotus> they had underground raves, warehouses that they'd build over weekends for the purpose of illegal raves

[11:20:36] <sentionics> is the road to nowhere, is it not enticing?
[11:21:07] <sentionics> it makes you forget your worries

[11:24:00] <DunceCotus> survival is kinda a moot point imo

[11:26:40] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: sounds like something you'd say to a child
[11:26:49] <DunceCotus> "look both ways before crossing the road"
[11:27:05] <DunceCotus> such statements do not tell us how to avoid suffering
[11:27:08] <amigojapan> It applies to everyone
[11:27:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if you are not careful when crossing the road, you can be hit by a car and end up suffering a lot
[11:28:01] <DunceCotus> I would say most suffering is unavoidable
[11:28:07] <DunceCotus> and that's what makes it suffering
[11:28:28] <DunceCotus> suffering just kinda happens to us

[12:12:50] <DunceCotus> life is always getting me down
[12:13:12] <DunceCotus> particularly filtered through this capitalist socius
[12:13:33] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I'm not actively suicidal, apologies for the drama
[12:13:46] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: mmmm that an incredibly  complex thought and difficult rumination.
[12:13:50] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: it was just an attempt at a shocking response to your question
[12:14:25] <DunceCotus> though I have been going through some shit that makes me wonder if there's "only one way out"
[12:14:46] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Either way, what does the ideal life look like to you? Do you pursue meaning or happiness, and have you found either?
[12:15:22] <DunceCotus> neither
[12:15:49] <DunceCotus> I pursue affects and intensities
[12:15:52] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: INTERESTING! What do you pursue?
[12:16:12] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Stimulus then? Something to remind you that you are alive?
[12:16:46] <DunceCotus> well we are never not alive
[12:17:45] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: mmmmm Well there is this great game on the snes, called Illusion of Gaia. 
[12:18:32] <DunceCotus> ok
[12:18:32] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: On the ending, they are ruminating on their mortality, and a girl who was dying stated, "I never felt so alive when I became so terminally ill" -- or something along those lines. 
[12:19:13] <Kill-Animals> That always stuck with me. I know its just a throwaway line in some old rpg video game, but I think its true.
[12:19:15] <DunceCotus> sure illness can be invigorating in some ways
[12:19:31] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: And are you ill?
[12:19:44] <DunceCotus> it can also just be awful
[12:19:49] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: yeah

[12:24:39] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: its always on my mind
[12:24:45] <DunceCotus> which is what makes it particularly bad
[12:24:53] <DunceCotus> if I could forget about it, wouldn't be too bad
[12:25:13] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I'm such a disagreeable person, and someone called me a liar today when I clearly wasn't, and they refused to listen. Its a person I look up to, and so it chews on me.
[12:25:22] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: And how long have you had this?
[12:25:33] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: apparently I need sinus surgery to help the drainage (I have deviated septum), but that surgery comes with some pretty messed up risks
[12:25:49] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: OH NO!
[12:26:11] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: i've had it for a few years
[12:26:19] <Kill-Animals> There is something I would try before surgery, but you might call me crazy for suggesting it so...

[12:30:06] <DunceCotus> sure
[12:30:30] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: that is like an extreme keto diet, you will lose weight on it
[12:30:37] <Kill-Animals> Could you eat only steak and bacon and pork for one month straight, and nothing else ( No sauces, spices, etc )
[12:30:59] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: no salt?

[12:31:41] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I could eat just steak and bacon but sounds like it would get boring af after the 3rd day
[12:31:48] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: If you are underweight, you will gain. If you are overweight, you will lose.
[12:31:52] <amigojapan> I see Kill-Animals
[12:31:53] <DunceCotus> eating too much of the same thing can be nauseating
[12:32:20] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: no veggies?
[12:32:31] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: There is some pallete fatigue. But after a month, you start introducing foods.
[12:32:32] <DunceCotus> Im not even sure how I'd manage that without getting sicker
[12:32:50] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Absolutely no vegetables. The purpose of an elimation diet is to figure out your allergies.
[12:33:12] <DunceCotus> i've had allergy tests tho, no allergies found?
[12:33:20] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: All vegetables, aka leaves stalks and roots, naturally have toxins in them.
[12:33:26] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: what if you are allergic to steak?
[12:33:31] <DunceCotus> though I think I have a food sensitivity to wheat and cow's milk
[12:33:48] <DunceCotus> beef allergy?
[12:33:56] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Its almost impossible because you are made out of flesh. And I kind of mispeak when I say, "Allergy", its actually about a sensitivity to toxins.
[12:34:28] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: well my symptoms do seem consistent with allergies
[12:34:31] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Do you get pastuerized or raw cows milk?
[12:34:48] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I don't drink it anymore, I drink almond milk now
[12:34:55] <Kill-Animals> The reason I ask is that milk requires gut bacteria to digest it. 
[12:34:57] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: but when I did it was pasturised
[12:35:11] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: almost milk like substance*
[12:35:21] <amigojapan> almond*
[12:35:29] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yeah I would say that the almond milk ***could*** be part of the cause of your illness. 
[12:35:46] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: this all started long before I started drinking almond milk
[12:36:16] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: one thing I think it could be is I drink a lot of sugar-free soda
[12:36:17] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Honest question though; Does this all sound crazy to you? 
[12:36:23] <DunceCotus> no
[12:36:29] <DunceCotus> its just really really hard for me to do
[12:36:48] <DunceCotus> and I hate that medicine seems so incompetent at identifying triggers 
[12:37:26] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yeah it is. I can only speak on my experience and my friends experiences. I think one of the most interesting examples, did you ever hear of that girl, "Michhaela Peterson"? She was the one who first told about it, 
[12:37:40] <DunceCotus> Jordan Peterson's neice?
[12:37:48] <Kill-Animals> and she mentioned that she just had some soy sauce after doing the elimation diet, and it caused her to hallucinate demons.
[12:37:57] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yeah thats her!
[12:38:02] <emmeka> lol the Jordan Peterson diet
[12:38:05] <DunceCotus> that was a lucky guess :/
[12:38:19] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: hallucinate demons? That's normal on soy
[12:38:24] <Kill-Animals> hahahahaha
[12:38:29] <Kill-Animals> lmao.
[12:38:43] <DunceCotus> I would be concerned if they didn't hallucinate demons 
[12:38:55] <amigojapan> I love soy sauce
[12:39:08] <DunceCotus> apparently soy is toxic af
[12:39:12] <DunceCotus> I very rarely have it
[12:39:19] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Soy Sauce tastes similar to rotten blood. 
[12:39:32] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: its just salty
[12:39:52] <DunceCotus> I mean dim sim wouldnt be the same without soy sauce
[12:39:55] <DunceCotus> that much I know
[12:39:59] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: But I think thats the reason why people like it. It has the same taste as our caveman diet.
[12:40:04] <DunceCotus> but that's all I'd ever eat it with
[12:40:08] <emmeka> "toxic"... soy has little antinutrients compared to most comparable sources of plant protein
[12:40:16] <Kill-Animals> ... I miss dimsum so much, lol. Its so tasty.
[12:40:29] <DunceCotus> emmeka: toxic af
[12:40:46] * emmeka pumps DunceCotus full of phytoestrogen
[12:40:52] <DunceCotus> I remember trying soy milk.. never again
[12:40:56] <emmeka> the... moob toxin
[12:40:56] <DunceCotus> emmeka: thanks
[12:41:05] <Kill-Animals> emmeka: It is. Theres even this interesting youtube meme video, where some teenager drank a vial of Soy Sauce and ended up in the hospital with liver failure. I think he died.
[12:41:23] <DunceCotus> yeesh
[12:41:46] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: is that like the cinnamon challenge
[12:41:56] <amigojapan> there is only one thing that is toxic af that is 4chan
[12:41:57] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: I tried soymilk for the first time at my friends, when I was 10, and I thought it was so disgusting.  
[12:41:59] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: which caused similar effects to asbestos exposure?
[12:42:02] <emmeka> Kill-Animals sounds like poorly prepared soy sauce. there's very little in soy sauce that your liver should need to work on, there's some antinutrients, but comparatively little for a plant.
[12:42:13] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Oh thats crazy. 
[12:42:23] <emmeka> there is a lot of salt, I guess
[12:42:37] <emmeka> consuming an entire soy sauce bottle's worth of salt sure wouldn't be ideal
[12:42:46] <DunceCotus> I think the liver can't process soy or something
[12:42:48] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: soy milk was drank before milk in Japan, it is not intended as a milk replacement
[12:42:54] <DunceCotus> so it has to work extra hard 
[12:42:56] <Kill-Animals> emmeka: Yeah; salt is deadly in its own way.
[12:43:27] <DunceCotus> almond milk is nice though
[12:43:35] <DunceCotus> though apparently we can't process almonds either?
[12:43:38] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: also, "Milk" --Soy doesnt have tits. I think it should be illegal to call it "Milk", just as its illegal to call margarine, "Dairy"
[12:43:43] <DunceCotus> there's a lot of plants we can't do shit with
[12:43:55] *** Joins: cdman (~dcm@user/dmc/x-4369397)
[12:43:58] <emmeka> DunceCotus it's the opposite, actually. soy proteins are remarkably digestible, and generally aid liver function.
[12:43:59] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I agree
[12:44:15] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: you can call it, milky substance tho
[12:44:31] <DunceCotus> emmeka: not according to the anti-soy internet sites I have encountered
[12:44:37] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Almond milk tastes amazing, but its still toxic. You see vegans living off of it and their hair is falling out; Their teeth are chipping, they are rapidly aging, etc
[12:44:55] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: jesus shit
[12:44:56] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Call it "Soylent White" 
[12:45:04] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I would trust emmeka any day over a web page
[12:45:13] <amigojapan> lol Kill-Animals
[12:45:33] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: lol have you seen that food product, "Soylent"? 
[12:45:39] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: is it made out of people?
[12:45:44] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: I drink calcium-enriched almond milk
[12:45:45] <emmeka> almost all sources of plant protein have 1 of 2 problems, or both. 1) they are deficient in lysine, the major limiting protein in human diets, and overly rich in sulphur proteins 2) they are fairly high in antinutrients, factors which work against your body's ability to digest a given nutrient or vitamin
[12:45:49] <DunceCotus> hopefully that counteracts the TOX
[12:45:58] <emmeka> soy is one of the fewer things on earth that is neither
[12:46:02] <Kill-Animals> no! but it probably would be more nutritious if it was.
[12:46:13] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I have only heard of it, it is not on sale in Japan
[12:46:36] <DunceCotus> what possible reason would someone have to say soy is toxic then
[12:46:43] <DunceCotus> anti-soy lobbyists?
[12:46:43] <Kill-Animals> emmeka: Thats so true. So many people have never heard of anti-nutrients. Its an emerging idea in diet today.
[12:46:43] <Sapphirus> Being allergic to greens is strange, to say the least.
[12:47:06] <Sapphirus> Everyone else can seemingly eat them and not be cramped over for a week wanting to die.
[12:47:12] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the internet is full of miss-information, dont get your medical advice form it
[12:47:18] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Well; Kids don't like greens naturally. I think thats kind of telling.
[12:47:24] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: where should I get my medical advice from?
[12:47:26] <emmeka> Kill-Animals thankfully my background is in *livestock* diets, where we've talked about antinutrients forever
[12:47:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: your doctor
[12:47:39] <emmeka> Kill-Animals and vegan diets aren't unhealthy because "almond milk is toxic" they're unhealthy because it's devoid of essential vitamins that are only obtainable from animal sources
[12:47:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: my doctor can't figure out what's wrong
[12:47:50] <emmeka> basically every vegan diet is entirely devoid of B12
[12:47:55] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: so even less so can you
[12:48:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: if I can't turn to doctors then i'm going to turn to dubious internet information
[12:48:33] <Kill-Animals> emmeka: Well its that they lack over 15 essential nutrients, but its also because they are highly toxic. Eating seeds for example is so destructive, because seeds by their nature are designed to be toxic and undigestable.
[12:48:34] <DunceCotus> there's too many holes in medicine
[12:48:46] <amigojapan> why DunceCotus, I would not, that can end up hurting you even more
[12:49:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: because I need do something about it
[12:49:10] <DunceCotus> I am not resigning myself to feeling like death all the time
[12:49:20] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: sometimes just staying the way you are is the better way
[12:49:35] <DunceCotus> that's what a resigned person says
[12:50:10] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: so what CAN we eat?
[12:50:11] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that is because you believe there are alternatives to medicine that actually work
[12:50:12] <DunceCotus> meat?
[12:50:25] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Changing diet is safe. If he were trying something like, "This crazy new drug from pfizer" -- Id exercise extreme caution.
[12:51:05] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: that is actually a medically approved drug
[12:51:10] <DunceCotus> I'd happily just eat meat but I'd feel like I need veg too
[12:51:14] <DunceCotus> potatoes
[12:51:18] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Depends how disciplined and how desperate you are for a solution. I tried something thought to be extremely dangerous, and it worked out for me.

[12:51:41] <emmeka> DunceCotus I'd exercise caution when dealing with someone who is literally trying to push the infamous Michaela Peterson diet on you :P
[12:51:43] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: So is vaccine. Meanwhile tons of young children are dying from heart attacks.
[12:51:47] <emmeka> bacon is definitely toxic lol
[12:52:02] <DunceCotus> im starting to think everything is toxic
[12:52:03] <emmeka> in multiple exciting ways
[12:52:16] <emmeka> DunceCotus it is, most things don't want you to eat them, ultimately
[12:52:20] <DunceCotus> maybe i'll stop eating
[12:52:30] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: You are somewhat right to be wary of bacon, because it is a cured meat. Meaning it could have smoke, excess salt, maple, or other things.
[12:52:36] <DunceCotus> eating hasn't felt right for some years now
[12:52:41] <emmeka> fortunately for us our bodies are very good at dealing with the hostility of things we try to murder with our stomachs
[12:53:07] <emmeka> Kill-Animals nitrates and nitrites...
[12:53:29] <DunceCotus> only problem with not eating is the hunger pangs, and the 'inevitable' emaciation
[12:53:35] <Sapphirus> Which even lunch meats have a ton of, emmeka.
[12:53:45] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: the most extreme thing you could try is what I do, and switch to a raw meat diet. This was pioneered by a guy named Aajonus, who lost his stomache to limphoma cancer.
[12:53:54] <Sapphirus> Pretty much any meat that's processed has them.
[12:54:02] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: how do you eat without a stomach?
[12:54:24] <Sapphirus> To avoid that, say in a meat-only diet, you'd avoid processed meats.
[12:54:30] <Kill-Animals> Raw meat was the only thing that he could digest. He especially ate rotten meat, because it was partly digested, hence good for him having no stomache.

[12:58:11] <DunceCotus> maybe i'll try a month without veg
[12:58:16] <DunceCotus> and see if I don't die
[12:58:22] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Actually one thing I have been wondering. Mind if I ask a somewhat insensitive question about the japanese? Its not meant to be a dig, but I don't live there.
[12:58:30] <Sapphirus> DunceCotus, do you think you're allergic to them?
[12:58:46] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: its clear im allergic or sensitive to something
[12:58:50] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: I think as long as you don't have 4 stomaches, you are allergic to pretty much all of them.
[12:58:54] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: auto-immune issues anyway
[12:59:24] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: whats that?
[12:59:30] <Sapphirus> I discovered I'm allergic particularly to greens. Once I eliminated them from my diet, all of my IBS symptoms vanished completely.
[13:00:08] <Sapphirus> Absolutely refuse to consume them unless I want to be in a world of pain and discomfort.
[13:00:19] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I almost never see any japanese with any facial hair. I saw one japanese guy with facial hair in a Military Recruitment video, but most are very smooth skinned. I kind of wonder if thats linked to how much soy the men eat? What do you think?
[13:00:21] <DunceCotus> Sapphirus: leafy greens?
[13:00:28] * amigojapan is lucky to seem to not be allergic to any food
[13:00:31] <Sapphirus> DunceCotus, pretty much any type of green.
[13:01:04] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: REALLY!? How did you come to trying that? Thats super interesting
[13:01:51] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I eat a lot of soy too and I have grown a beard, also, like Matz the maker of the ruby programming language has a beard, its just that eveybody shaves here every day
[13:01:53] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Well you don't really know if you are, until you try an elimination diet. Some people live with allergies without noticing; they just think its normal to always have x symptom nagging at them.
[13:01:58] <DunceCotus> I wish I could avoid facial hair
[13:02:00] <Sapphirus> It was mostly incidental, Kill-Animals. This was long before the Petersons were relevant.

[13:04:51] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Wow; rarely ever see guys like that. That is cool

[13:06:02] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: he just grew a beard cause people told him "inventors of programming langauges have a long beard" 
[13:06:35] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Same. When I switched to raw meat from a mostly perogie and grain diet, my joint pain went away, my arthritic pain went away, my eyesight improved, my creativity returned ( I could literally feel my brain growing -- it was strange )

[13:06:53] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: DunceCotus the Aiunu tribe used to all have long beards

[13:07:16] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: you could feel your brain growing?
[13:07:17] <Sapphirus> DunceCotus, scar tissue is fabulous for that.
[13:07:35] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: raw meat? Not cooked?
[13:07:40] <DunceCotus> Im not sure i'm game 
[13:07:57] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, that last part is a strange way to articulate mental clarity.
[13:07:58] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yes. Im not the only one either. You can watch ex vegan interviews on youtube channel, "Goatis" or "Sv3rige", and a lot of people attest to this.
[13:08:53] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: I was desperate. I don't like to mention it, but i was kind of at the end of my rope in my life, so I said, "Fuck it. Ill try eating it all raw"
[13:09:02] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: like raw beef?
[13:09:11] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yep. 
[13:09:16] <DunceCotus> is the raw required or can I cook it a bit
[13:09:40] <Kill-Animals> You can. Go ahead. It usually tastes better that way.
[13:09:50] <amigojapan> raw beef is a food in Japan, altho not something you eat every meal
[13:10:19] <amigojapan> also raw horse
[13:10:32] <Kill-Animals> the arguement against cooking meat is that the browning is technically a carcinogen, and that bacteria don't naturally exist to break down cooked meat in nature. There is also this really fascinating study in the 30s about "Pottengers Cats"
[13:10:45] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, the strangest part is that I'm not allergic to nightshades in any obvious way.
[13:10:58] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Based? Ive also seen in tokyo, some serve raw pork sushi, which is awesome.
[13:11:09] <Sapphirus> I can consume them on the regular without problems.
[13:11:27] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: That is strange, but then again, that plant has been refined so much that I'm sure the worst strains of the plant have been mitigated.
[13:11:35] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: don't you need veg for certain nutrients? 
[13:11:41] <DunceCotus> im confused at this only eating meat
[13:11:56] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: not aware of hte raw pork, but could be out there
[13:11:56] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Nope. There is not a single nutrient you can only get from plants and not meat. 
[13:12:17] <DunceCotus> Kill-Animals: can I eat chicken?
[13:12:30] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: raw horse is called "sakura niku" or cherry blosson meat
[13:12:50] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Yeah I've had raw chicken. It tastes basically like sashimi with a slight chicken taste.
[13:13:06] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I've never tried raw horse!?? What does it taste like?
[13:13:36] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I am not even exsagerating, it tastes EXACTLY like raw tuna
[13:14:04] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: it is like horses are made out of tunna
[13:14:12] <Kill-Animals> That must taste so good.
[13:14:28] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: sure, tuna also tastes good, so it does
[13:14:33] <Kill-Animals> You can make raw ground beef taste like tuna if you mix it with sour cream.

[13:17:57] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: mmmmmm I've never heard of anyone I know getting sick from it. There definitely is an art to aging the meat, just like anything.
[13:18:51] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: IF there was a danger, it would be in a situation where if your intestines were like, "Dead" if that makes sense, a parasite could start eating the dead flesh inside you, causing problems.
[13:19:38] <Kill-Animals> Parasites don't usually eat flesh thats alive. However that being said, veggies have parasites as well, especially raw so its not like meat is the only culprit for that.
[13:19:39] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: in a hotel where the one night cost for one room cocts 12 thousand dollars per night, they served "snow aged meat" , where they kept the meat inside snow duing the winter
[13:20:09] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: 12 thousand is too much. My gosh.

[13:21:58] <Kill-Animals> DunceCotus: Oh you havn't tried sashimi? Thats crazy. Although when I think of it, until sushi became a thing here in the west, most people would be very scared or apprehensive of eating raw fish, for the same fears.

[13:44:54] <Kill-Animals> I love animals too. I tend to think people who do not eat meat, do so out of self guilt or turmoil. To me its like saying, "I do not feel worthy to eat." or "I do not have faith that when the animal becomes part of me, I will be able to elevate its existence."
[13:45:37] <Kill-Animals> Another way of putting that, is that I think feeding animals to criminals, would consitute as "Cruelty to animals"

[14:04:27] <Kill-Animals> hey. You are supposed to mispell hashems name ~
[14:04:40] <amigojapan> lol
[14:05:02] <Kill-Animals> Its amazing how they sing it. I grew up christian, and I always wondered how the psalms were supposed to be at all musical.
[14:05:18] <Kill-Animals> When I heard them sung in hebrew though, I was pretty astounded.
[14:05:36] <amigojapan> I see
[14:06:49] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: Jews do much better in preserving the culture than Japanese do tho, Japanese culture is in danger of being forgotten due to olack of interest
[14:07:46] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: and problems like not keeping the old callendar dates, changing celebrations to match dates on the Gregorian calendar for example
[14:07:47] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I kind of find that hard to believe. Those temples are probably not going anywhere anytime soon, and you still have the emporor as a preserving force. That being said...
[14:08:22] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: peole 20 years old often dont even know the word "shinto"
[14:09:17] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Well I imagine that shintoism officially is state sponsored in japan. That poses a problem because religions operate very similarly to businesses, in that on a free market, a business goes under, leaving the compettive ones alive and well.
[14:09:37] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: going to the temples is mostly some kind of currupteed traditions now, you are suppoed to go in Japanese new year, not on gregorian calendar new year
[14:10:44] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I think the thing that killed shintoism was the empreror being forced to say "I am not God" on the radio after WW2
[14:11:21] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: imagine Jesus actucally returning and saying "nah, I am not really God"...
[14:12:03] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Thats easy. He already said as much in the new testement. I can't imagine though what it was like for the Japanese.
[14:15:51] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: and shintoism and buddhism and "christianity" kind of coexist nowdays, you have a shintoist/christian wedding (in a fake church too, with a fake preist) and then when you die you have a buddhist funeral
[14:16:23] <amigojapan> there is a joke that says "I was born shintoist, I got married christian, and I will die buddhist"
[14:16:36] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: How fake of a church? 
[14:17:19] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: well, its not really a church, just looks like a church and acts like a church
[14:17:41] <Kill-Animals> Does it have a cross?
[14:19:22] <amigojapan> yes Kill-Animals
[14:19:37] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: here is someone blogging about   it http://kevinincairo.blogspot.com/2011/06/real-wedding-fake-church.html?m=1

[14:21:30] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I have met some of the fake presists
[14:21:39] <amigojapan> they are not really preists
[14:21:56] <amigojapan> they just memorise the lines
[14:22:13] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: very well paid job, I am kind of jelous
[14:22:34] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: usually a foreigner does the fake presist job
[14:22:44] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: "Every Japanese girl wants to wear a white dress and to marry in a church. They get the idea from movies and t.v. shows made in America, that these western weddings are much more appealing than their domestic weddings involving being married at a shrine wearing a kimono." 
[14:23:29] *** Quits: luke-jr (~luke-jr@user/luke-jr) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[14:23:33] <Kill-Animals> This is too simplistic of an animation. The reason why people marry in a church via that aesthetic, is because there is something more "True" about it in its essense.
[14:23:34] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: the wedding I went to had both, shintoist and christians styles
[14:23:49] <Kill-Animals> of a reason*

[14:24:22] <amigojapan> ok

[14:25:10] <Kill-Animals> Well to start, white symbolizes virginity.
[14:25:12] <amigojapan> oh come on google
[14:25:24] <Kill-Animals> I get what you mean. 
[14:25:31] <amigojapan> ah ok
[14:26:06] <Kill-Animals> The west before it lost its moral authority, dominated the planet through its truth.
[14:26:49] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I agree with the writer of that blog
[14:27:57] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: new Japanese structures are never even named with Japanese names, for example the "rainbow bridge" was never called "niji bashi" which woudl be hwo you say that in Japanese

[14:29:22] <Urchin[emacs]> Kill-Animals: and the problem was?
[14:29:50] * amigojapan should start a fake church chain in america for atheists that want to get married at a non christian thing but still want the church feel
[14:29:53] <Kill-Animals> No problems. It was the best humanity was offering at the time.
[14:30:19] <amigojapan> that would be a good business
[14:30:34] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: It would be like selling fake fire places.

[14:32:32] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: So in a sense, I would say that Mormons are the truest religion in America, because they are the most accomplished and closest to their ideal.

[14:34:25] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Right and thats the point I was getting at. Truth lays not exclusively in rhetorical facts like the ones you just listed. 
[14:34:55] <amigojapan> you have a werid idea of what truth is
[14:35:04] <Kill-Animals> The mormon foundational story is ludicrous in many ways. But if you look at it differently, you could also say,
[14:35:30] <Kill-Animals> "The fruits of a good tree shall produce good fruits. The fruits of a bad tree shall produce bad fruit. You shall know them by their fruits."
[14:35:31] *** luke-jr- is now known as luke-jr
[14:36:02] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: is the world itself, and saying the truth is statements like "I  am typing now on my andorid using a USB keyboard" that is a true statement, and corresposnts to the actual truth in reality
[14:36:32] <Kill-Animals> You shall know what is true and what is false by the fruits a group produces. So today, Japan is bearing good fruit. So is Israel. Canada is producing bad fruit. So is South Africa.

[14:37:58] <Kill-Animals> The Muslims are very "true" today insofar as they are having big families. 
[14:38:08] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: well, not fruit, but we are still in a potato shortage in Japan that goes back to nobember, cuase of a problem with potaatoes in Canada
[14:38:26] <Kill-Animals> :O

[14:40:04] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: are you Canadian?
[14:40:35] <Kill-Animals> Urchin[emacs]: Just by the by; Before the Aztecs were forcibly civilized by the christians, on a single day, they would murder over 25,000 innocent children as a sacrifice to their god. That in itself justifies colonialism.
[14:40:39] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: yeah.

[14:41:12] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, you guys import a lot of potatos from us?
[14:41:28] <Sapphirus> Our domestic supply has been able to keep up.

[15:08:36] <Kill-Animals> what are you watching these days?
[15:09:21] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, cat litter doubled in price for me.
[15:09:50] <amigojapan> ouch Sapphirus
[15:10:10] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: watch astro boy
[15:10:12] <Sapphirus> 40 pounds of it used to cost $25 and now 18 pounds of it costs $25.
[15:10:23] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Thats old though.
[15:10:30] <amigojapan> ouch that is more than double Sapphirus
[15:10:39] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals:old does nto mean bad
[15:10:41] <Sapphirus> yep
[15:11:17] <Sapphirus> Roughly calculated it to almost 150% increase between December and Feb-March
[15:11:21] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Most of the time it does. The animation is bad, and the story telling is often sloppy. 
[15:11:37] <Sapphirus> I think they're lying about inflation if that's anything to go by.
[15:11:42] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I have not been watching prices that closely, but I dont think prices tend to go up in Japan except when they have an increase in consumption tax, which is not that often
[15:12:05] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals:I hate new anime
[15:12:10] <Sapphirus> I'm not sure if it's a supply chain issue or if it's actual inflation.
[15:12:22] <Sapphirus> Price doesn't seem to have gone up in the U.s. for what it's worth
[15:12:52] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: hmm, couldnt Canada have  inflation and not the US?
[15:13:15] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: You are missing out. My favourite old anime from the 80s is probably bubblegum crisis or something like that. 
[15:13:19] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: let me see if there is a web tool to calculate this
[15:13:29] <Sapphirus> We'll maybe, but maybe we're just a test market, since major cat litter brands are also engaging in shrinflation.
[15:13:42] <Sapphirus> It's not just one brand doing it.
[15:14:06] <Sapphirus> They want to see if they can sustain it here before rolling it out everywhere else, perhaps.
[15:14:12] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: that is a good one yes, but from the 80s I probably need to go with Gal Force; eternal sotry. it is also Biblical so you may like it
[15:14:25] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals:and it is a movie, so nto a big time investment
[15:15:07] <Kill-Animals> Ill download those and see.
[15:15:23] <Kill-Animals> Record of Lodoss war in the 80s was excellent as well.
[15:15:36] <Kill-Animals> I think that was 89
[15:15:38] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: if there is really a cat littler monopoly behind it, then they can raise it as high as they want and you will have no choise anyway
[15:16:07] <amigojapan> yeah I liked that Kill-Animals
[15:16:27] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: my favorie modern anime is re zero I guess
[15:16:44] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: going back in time Sailor Moon and NGE
[15:17:29] <lastonestanding> pokemon are made to fight
[15:17:37] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: oof. I do not share your affinity for re zero. But thats all right; my favourite modern, mmmmm well for a comedy, it would be "Girls Monthly: Nozaki Kun"
[15:17:39] <lastonestanding> why else do they have various attacks?
[15:18:02] <Sapphirus> I could always switch to a local supplier, amigojapan. There's a few local companies that sell bays of the same clay.
[15:18:14] <Sapphirus> If I'm not mistaken, anyway.
[15:18:18] <lastonestanding> doesn't a pokemon die when it evolves?
[15:18:34] <Sapphirus> All produced here and isn't shipped from China on a slow boat.
[15:18:35] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I am not a huge fan of comedy, I preffer tragedy, but if i need to pick 2 comedies, then azumanga and nichijo are my favorites of all times

[15:19:52] <Shinra> lots of stuff as always Kill-Animals 
[15:20:00] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: let me get this right, it is only a problme with cat litter? I have experienced hyper inflation in Mexico, and it was everything, nto one proruct
[15:20:08] <Shinra> today I watched the final OVA of non non biyori that only just released
[15:20:27] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, the prices of everything is going up in the double digits.
[15:20:28] <amigojapan> Shinra:oh I still need to see that
[15:20:30] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Nichijou is a national treasure. Ill look up azumanga
[15:20:34] <Sapphirus> double digit percentages or more*
[15:20:59] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I find azumanga to be even better than Nichijo
[15:21:20] <Kill-Animals> azumanga was 2002. Thats not modern, lol
[15:21:21] <Sapphirus> Groceries, housing, etc. are all going up in similar ways, although not to the same 150% extremes.
[15:21:21] <amigojapan> Sapphirus:ouch :( I dont thikn that is the case here

[15:36:40] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: See my issue with re:Zero was its harem trope; MC attracks women without having any redeemable qualities, and despite him being fundamentally dishonest under a euphamism of being "nice"
[15:37:29] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, harem tropes are just bleh, though a minor issue.
[15:37:40] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I won't try and oversell something. But I am ready to give it a perfect score. There is not a flaw in it, and I am a harsh critic.
[15:37:49] <Sapphirus> Not such a minor issue, however, when it's the primary focus.
[15:38:09] <milkshake1> i know this is anime, but the latest one piece manga spoiler is a hint that one piece is going to end soon.
[15:38:29] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Well I like a good harem. But it has to be earned, and based on merit. Not, "Oh I helped the hottest girl in the school pick up her papers one time, and apparently no guy has ever been nice to her like that"
[15:38:31] <amigojapan> Sapphirus:the other isekai I was able to tolerate was ... hmm, i cant seem to remember the name at this moment
[15:39:07] <Sapphirus> I liked SAO, as much flack as I might get for saying that from people.
[15:39:19] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Konosuba is a great isekai

[15:41:12] <Urchin[emacs]> Kill-Animals: the aztec part doesn't match my knowledge of their human sacrifice practices, afaik, they sacrificed mostly adults, and often captured soldiers, OTOH, the said colonizers also practiced human sacrifice

[15:44:38] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I guess Ray earth is supposed to be tragic, but it is also kind cause it is for kids
[15:45:18] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I think with rayearth they were mostly looking for a way to sell mecha toys to girls
[15:45:22] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Do you like tragedy in the gore sense as well? You might like Dororo; Its about a child born with no face, no skin, no arms, no legs, no eyes

[16:00:28] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: It is. Did you read the final chapters of the manga?
[16:00:36] <amigojapan> no
[16:00:46] <amigojapan> I only watched the anime
[16:00:49] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Oh. Well thats what I based my decision on.
[16:00:56] <amigojapan> ah ok
[16:00:58] <Kill-Animals> I had to know what happened afterwards.
[16:01:07] <amigojapan> I see
[16:01:45] <Kill-Animals> Also; the guy lost his wife, and then his maps fell, and then he left them, and then he was alone.
[16:02:03] <amigojapan> yup, I did watch that
[16:02:03] <Kill-Animals> Or that woman; she builds the plane, and ... Well no spoilers. But you know
[16:02:24] <Kill-Animals> Thats a great piece of tragedy.
[16:02:32] <amigojapan> but he was a kind of side character, ti did nto feel very close, and people also die, in it, but that is glossed over
[16:03:05] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: she is shown falling down in a parachute tho
[16:03:14] <Kill-Animals> mmmm guess you could see it that way.
[16:04:23] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I would call girls last tour more of a philosophical anime, with the main important scene being when they talk with the robot that is taking care of the fish
[16:04:34] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: What did you think of Paranoia Agent?
[16:04:46] <amigojapan> I did nto watch that
[16:05:23] <amigojapan> but I have heard about it
[16:05:25] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: philosophical only in the slice of life sort of way. Boogiepop on the other hand, is actually one of the more philosophical animes Ive watched. I think moreso than even lain.
[16:05:56] <amigojapan> ok Kill-Animals I will give that a chance I guess
[16:06:13] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I don't know if its tragic so much as it is twisted. Oh but damn, there is this one episode... it brings goosebumps.
[16:06:23] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: my favorite 2 phislosophical animes are ergo proxy and kino no tabi
[16:06:36] <Kill-Animals> Ill download those two.
[16:06:57] <amigojapan> alright, I recommend those two
[16:07:22] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: but with ergo proxy the real meat of the story starts at episode 14
[16:07:33] <amigojapan> many people abandon it before that
[16:08:06] <Kill-Animals> kind of surprised you didnt say Ghost in the Shell, although I don't know whether one could exactly call that philosophical rather than just sci-fi
[16:08:17] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: how about shinsekai yori? I liked that
[16:08:27] * Kill-Animals looks
[16:08:54] <Kill-Animals> Will give it a shot
[16:08:58] <amigojapan> nice
[16:09:15] <amigojapan> ok Kill-Animals I will give boogiepop a try 
[16:10:41] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I will go to 7/11 but I will take my phone with me, so I will just be a bit distracted
[16:10:59] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: nice. Its got some almost touching the fourth wall meta in it too.
[16:12:08] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Oh wait, you must have seen, "Fumetsu no Anata e" -- Thats like tragedy all the way
[16:12:46] <Kill-Animals> Some girl from 4chan reccomended it to me, and I ended up almost crying. ( I have never cried before ever and dont believe anyone who says otherwise. )
[16:13:37] <amigojapan> Yeah I watched that first episode Kill-Animals 
[16:15:23] <Kill-Animals> and?
[16:16:00] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: seemed forced
[16:16:59] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: not accuainted enough with the character to feel that sad
[16:17:42] <JesseDesu> aquainted
[16:17:55] <amigojapan> Ty
[16:17:56] <JesseDesu> actually wait
[16:17:57] <Kill-Animals> oof. Thats harsh criticism. I'd say keep watching a few more eps.
[16:17:58] <JesseDesu> not sure
[16:18:25] <amigojapan> Alright Kill-Animals 
[16:19:16] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: that's episodic right?
[16:20:09] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: No; it all ties in. I can't spoil it, otherwise ... yeah 
[16:20:33] <amigojapan> Ah ok Kill-Animals I'll give it another shot

[16:23:18] <Kill-Animals> The first season is good enough. The second season was done by "Cartoon Network" and is just trash. But whats really interesting about Big O, is that it is a homage to Batman, the Animated Series.

[16:26:48] <Kill-Animals> I believe you.  Taka no Tsume, I have two animes on my list that I can download. From the cover art though, it looks like not my sort of thing
[16:26:50] <amigojapan> And you could argue it's a big advertisement
[16:27:00] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: do you like parody?
[16:27:11] <amigojapan> Yeah
[16:27:44] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Wonder what you think of one punch man? Considering they parody tragedy here and there
[16:27:52] <Kill-Animals> "LUMAN RIDER SMASH"
[16:28:26] <amigojapan> Too shounen for me
[16:28:27] <Sapphirus> one punch man is awful. It couldn't make it through the first episode.
[16:28:47] <Kill-Animals> wowwwwww
[16:29:20] <Kill-Animals> thats amazing. Its one of my favourite animes. I just love it in every single way.
[16:29:52] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: what didn't you like about it?
[16:29:52] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: people have different tastes
[16:30:07] *** Suzuka sets mode: -b *!*@user/luke-jr$##anime-help
[16:30:10] <Sapphirus> Scaling is horrendous and unrealistic even for fiction
[16:30:44] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: you mean, the fact that he kills all enemies with one punch?
[16:30:54] <Kill-Animals> You want him to struggle?
[16:31:12] <Sapphirus> Well yes, what's the point if you're just going to scale everything like that?
[16:31:15] <Sapphirus> I'd almost rather watch DBZ
[16:31:41] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: because thats part of the joke. You see him struggle in other ways.
[16:32:07] <Kill-Animals> Such as, he is constantly belittled by heroes much much weaker than him, because he never gets credit for his work.
[16:32:34] <Kill-Animals> And he's poor, so he has to abandone fights because there is a sale at the grocery store.
[16:32:49] <Sapphirus> Dynamics there are just incoherent imho
[16:33:28] <Kill-Animals> And he pisses people off because when he gives them advice on how to get stronger, he tells them to do 200 pushups every day, when that is just incredibly simple and doesnt explain how he got so strong.
[16:34:55] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Honestly half the fun is watching the other regular heroes battle it out. The sea-king saga was demonstrative of just how deadly every demon actually is, and you have this super hero, "Lumen rider" whos super power is that he rides a bike
[16:35:40] <Sapphirus> There's tons of anime I can watch if I want to entertain myself with battles.
[16:35:46] <Kill-Animals> and then throws it at his enemies, with so much bravery but so little ... effect on anything. I just love it.

[16:35:59] <Sapphirus> Like this shitty Isekai-like haram I'm watching, even though I hate harems.
[16:36:02] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: the only thing that pisses me off is that I live in saitama prefecture 
[16:36:03] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: HIS SUPER POWER IS THAT HE RIDES A BIKE
[16:36:14] <Sapphirus> And personally don't really like isekai
[16:37:01] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, I raise you MHA as an anime that I'd rather watch over One Punch Man.
[16:37:12] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: HIS SUPER POWER IS THAT HE RIDES A BIKE THO!!!! lmao. He's even ranked. 
[16:37:52] <amigojapan> And people are ignorant and I need to educate them Kill-Animals 
[16:37:54] <Kill-Animals> And one of the most deadliest villians, is a fan, like one of those fans that turns its head and blows air. 
[16:38:15] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: So true. The ignorant masses need you.
[16:38:40] <amigojapan> Lol alright Kill-Animals 
[16:39:18] <Sapphirus> What else can I say, Kill-Animals? When the scaling is that awful, even unrealistic for fiction for me, and lacks enough depth to make up for all of that -- I can't be bothered.
[16:39:21] <Kill-Animals> HIS SUPER POWER IS THAT HE RIDES A BIKE! And another super hero's power, is that he wears a tank top, and is called tanktop man.
[16:39:26] <Sapphirus> There are too many things that would drive me off the rails.
[16:39:45] <Sapphirus> At least I get joy out of watching Shikkakumon No Saikyou Kenja.
[16:39:54] <Sapphirus> It's garbage, but that's what's fun about watching it.
[16:40:32] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: I'm kind of stunned, cause one punch man was created to make fun of the power scaling you saw in things like dragonball z. 
[16:40:41] <Sapphirus> If I'm going to watch somethign that's trashy, I want to be able to laugh at how trashy it is whilst I'm watching it.
[16:41:08] <Kill-Animals> and its got a super hero whos power is ... just riding a bike. Lmao I cant get over how happy that makes me.
[16:41:29] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, that may be so, but it's too much for me. Not my type of humor if it's supposed to be ironical.
[16:41:31] <Kill-Animals> And not like a motor bike, just a bicycle. He wears a bicycle helmet and everything.
[16:42:30] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: There was this ova, where it focussed on someone stealing his longest french fry, and it ruining his day because he is poor.
[16:43:36] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: who would win? Super sayajin Goku or one punch man?
[16:43:49] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: one punch man no contest.
[16:43:57] <amigojapan> Lol ok
[16:44:09] <Kill-Animals> I'm being serious.
[16:44:23] <amigojapan> Alright
[16:44:31] <Kill-Animals> he struggles with being bored during fights! 
[16:44:42] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, I'll put it this way: Another problem I have with it, although I'd have to watch a few more episodes to confirm, is that you've seen them all once you've seen one.
[16:44:59] <Kill-Animals> mmmmmmm
[16:45:39] <Sapphirus> Even this shitty isekai/jrpg-esque thing I'm watching right now can at least dangle a little bit chow on a fishing line.
[16:45:44] <Kill-Animals> I guess if you were extra cynical you could see thigns that way, but it never felt like that for me so
[16:47:06] <Sapphirus> That's fine. I'm glad you enjoyed it :3
[16:47:33] <Sapphirus> We'd all be boring if we liked the same things.
[16:48:08] <Kill-Animals> There is the one part, where dis ninja jumps over him, and hes like the fastest in the universe, and saitama just has his hand in the air randomly, and as he tunrs, the ninja gets hit in the balls by total accident.
[16:48:49] <Kill-Animals> it was just perfect, dumb, obvious, humor, making fun of itself.
[16:49:11] <amigojapan> I don't find it very funny
[16:49:23] <Kill-Animals> Also I get a kick out of the fact that the manga author drew saitama so poorly becaus he himself was just an awful artist, and wanted to get manga out on paper.
[16:49:46] <Sapphirus> Yeah, but don't you understand why I initially dropped it? You're describing a formula that is laid out bare on the first episode, like someone slamming a large crate onto a table.
[16:50:14] <Sapphirus> They open up the crate and show you everything they have to offer.
[16:51:00] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Its not formulaic. Its just funny. He is so poor, that he ends up eating a lot of the enemies that try and kill him in a hot pot.
[16:51:20] <Sapphirus> Something can be both ironic and simultaneously formulaic. 
[16:51:31] <Sapphirus> AVGN is a great example of that.
[16:51:59] <Kill-Animals> uhhhhhhhhh
[16:52:43] <Sapphirus> Doubt my opinion will change much, but I could give it a fair three-episode shake instead of dropping it 2-3/4s of way through the first episode.
[16:52:51] <Kill-Animals> I guess avgn has his moments. All that toilet humor is kind of ajoke in itself.
[16:52:55] <amigojapan> this is why I like to wait 20 years fater an anime came out so that I can filter out the good form the bad
[16:53:38] <Sapphirus> There's nothing that gets stale faster than formulaic irony or comedy.
[16:53:47] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: I mean its a pardody. There arnet that many parody animes out there to begin with. I gues gintama is one.
[16:54:14] <Kill-Animals> Excel Saga is another popular parody
[16:54:25] <amigojapan> gintama is ok
[16:54:45] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: I watched the first few eps. It was okay.
[16:55:02] <amigojapan> yup. its ok, its funny
[16:55:15] <Sapphirus> It makes sense that it is a paraody. I was too distracted by the other flaws, which are still flaws if I might add.
[16:55:20] <Kill-Animals> metal gear panic, fumufufu is hilarious, and its a parody of itself.
[16:55:31] <Sapphirus> Just because it's being done ironically doesn't make it any less bad.
[16:55:33] <Sapphirus> lol
[16:56:12] <Sapphirus> Using DBZ as an insult almost tells you what I think of DBZ.
[16:56:35] <MootPoot> android 18 tho
[16:56:42] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: I just don't get what you are expecting? Its called one punch man. Were you expecting two punches?
[16:57:16] <Sapphirus> What can I say? It's not my type of irony.
[16:57:33] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Watch up to the sea king. Saitama in some ways is actually a background character in One Punch Man, interestingly enough.
[16:58:20] <Sapphirus> I'll have to do it when I'm feeling peak masochism. 
[16:58:22] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: either you like irony, or you have a steel will
[16:58:28] <amigojapan> Sapphirus:some people just dont get, that different folks different strokes
[16:58:35] * MootPoot inserts a bad metallurgy joke
[16:58:44] <name100> amigojapan
[16:58:50] <amigojapan> hey MootPoot
[16:58:57] <amigojapan> hey name100
[16:59:13] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, yeah, I agree.
[16:59:17] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Well in this case, I think hes just missing the point, and judging after not even watching a full episode.
[16:59:32] <Sapphirus> I've watched three quarters of an episode already.
[16:59:52] * Kill-Animals eyeroll
[16:59:57] <Sapphirus> I could sense that there was some irony, but it wasn't my cup of tea.
[17:00:39] <Sapphirus> Do you like DBZ, Kill-Animals?
[17:00:47] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Have you ever watched dbz abridged?
[17:01:08] <Sapphirus> Okay that question answers my question. I take it you're a fan of DBZ, as well.
[17:01:12] <MootPoot> hai amigojapan - just eating, brb
[17:01:14] <Sapphirus> See, I get why you would like One Punch Man.
[17:01:18] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Dragonball original is a perfect little anime. Love that. DBZ is meta funny.
[17:01:32] <klaxa> i like dbz abridged
[17:01:38] <amigojapan> k
[17:01:40] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Well I grew up with dbz.
[17:01:53] <Sapphirus> I'm not a huge fan of DBZ precisely because of how bad it's scaled and how formulaic it is.
[17:02:06] <Sapphirus> Some might like that formula, but I honestly can't stand it.
[17:02:06] <Kill-Animals> klaxa: too bad they disbanded. It was better than the show they abridged. Really funny writers.

[17:04:58] <klaxa> oh right
[17:05:01] <Kill-Animals> klaxa: No. They never got to bu.
[17:05:12] <amigojapan> too much Kill-Animals
[17:05:30] <klaxa> i watched it to fall asleep to
[17:05:39] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: goku asks piccilo if he's a yoshi, because piccolo lays eggs. 
[17:05:48] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: He then asks if he can ride him.
[17:06:04] <amigojapan> :P Kill-Animals
[17:06:05] <klaxa> also, i'm not sure it's as much as not being able to keep it together, but look at how it took 5 years
[17:06:16] <klaxa> i think they just moved on to other projects too
[17:06:46] <Kill-Animals> klaxa: all their other projects frankly suck and arent funny at all.
[17:06:58] <klaxa> sounds like a you-problem to me though
[17:07:06] <amigojapan> there is nothing worse than watching bad anime for hours on end
[17:07:07] <Kill-Animals> Like, they did hellsing abridged --- why?  Hellsing is a short ass anime.
[17:07:14] <DunceCotus> anyone else get this thing where its either too quiet or too loud

[17:07:32] <Kill-Animals> klaxa: I'm a harsh critic. 
[17:08:11] <Kill-Animals> But dbz-abridged is just so ... flippin, funny
[17:08:13] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: since tomako usually is listening to music, I dont usually get quiet times
[17:08:19] <klaxa> also a you-problem :^) but it's okay to not like stuff, but yeah if you don't like their stuff it's a you-problem, but if they don't get clicks it's a their-problem
[17:08:31] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Is it good music?
[17:08:48] <isekaijin> As long as it's good music, I don't think I'd have any reason to complain.
[17:09:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: j-pop?
[17:09:03] <Kill-Animals> Like, when Cell does the kamaya-maya, Piccilo is like, "What? Thats Gokus move!?... and krillians.... and master roshis... and Yamchas... and me, that one time I tried it... "
[17:09:08] <klaxa> i would assume they were just more familiar with the dbz stuff and also did it more for fun and less because it was expected of them
[17:09:09] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I like it, tomako has shown me whole new genreas I would not have gotten into otherwise

[18:53:55] <bxgelsan> My reality is fucking weird. But I'm sure someone out there experiences a variation of how I see reality.
[18:53:59] <DunceCotus> and more related to how desire is currently produced over any true limitation
[18:55:20] <Poeticode> i think there are some definitions and context I'm lacking

[18:56:23] <DunceCotus> all variations of reality are legitimate, the result of real production
[18:57:15] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, Its the result of reflections of light and the way in which my brain percieves that data. I find some more attractive than others, I like unique features.
[18:57:28] <bxgelsan> but its more than that.
[18:57:46] <DunceCotus> the problem is to describe our realities we need to use a shared language
[18:58:03] <DunceCotus> which in turn puts limits on how we perceive reality (and how reality is produced)
[18:58:03] <bxgelsan> DunceCotus, im not joining your cult :p
[18:58:08] <bxgelsan> keep your NLP
[18:58:26] <bxgelsan> thats half a joke.

[19:00:00] <Poeticode> DunceCotus I once heard it described that language can only express asymptotic reality. Can never fully express it
[19:00:05] <bxgelsan> its useful in medicine, but also can be used for not so much good. useful in business, useful in general.
[19:00:35] <bxgelsan> i over explain myself and end up getting off subject, im self aware to a degree.
[19:00:44] <bxgelsan> some people arent.
[19:00:45] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: it has to be used creatively to express it
[19:00:48] <Poeticode> lol NLP is Natural Language Processing for me
[19:01:07] <Poeticode> nah analogies and shit won't suffice DunceCotus

[19:09:04] <bxgelsan> The Antonov An-124 Ruslan (Russian: Антонов Ан-124 Руслан, lit. 'Ruslan'; NATO reporting name: Condor) is a large, strategic airlift, four-engined aircraft that was designed in the 1980s by the Antonov design bureau in the Ukrainian SSR, then part of the Soviet Union (USSR). The An-124 is the world's 2nd heaviest gross weight production cargo airplane and heaviest operating cargo aircraft, behind the destroyed one-off Antonov
[19:09:04] <bxgelsan>  An-225 Mriya (a greatly enlarged design based on the An-124) and the Boeing 747-8.[4] The An-124 remains the largest military transport aircraft in service.[5] The lead designer of the An-124 (and the An-225) was Viktor Tolmachev.[6]

[19:18:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Poeticode: That's more for lack of trying & education.
[19:18:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Our color perception likely differs, yet we are all thought from reference what red or blue is.
[19:19:37] <Poeticode> and thus reality can't be fully expressed in language
[19:20:42] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: the answer is in your name: Poetry
[19:21:05] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: through creative use of language we can at least 'approach' the phenomenology of reality
[19:21:17] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: I think it is somewhat asymptotic
[19:23:15] <Poeticode> funny to say poetry helps elucidate thinking when you can have three english professors read the same shakespeare verse and come with three possibilities of what it actually meant
[19:23:48] <Poeticode> also gets me thinking of the shitshow that is biblical texts
[19:23:53] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: the meaning is less important than the affects it produces in the readers
[19:24:27] <Poeticode> you may not get how I taste this apple but at least you'll feel the pleasure I get from it
[19:26:17] <Shinra> gachi gachi
[19:26:18] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: well there's also this self-mystification aspect
[19:27:01] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: like do we really know how we ourselves taste things? Or do we have a grasp over the phenomenology in ourselves?
[19:27:18] <Poeticode> ooh I like that
[19:28:16] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: I think all these things are broadly shared, but we're all contributing to how phenomena is defined
[19:28:40] <Jigsy> Loli!
[19:30:21] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: I mean how different can your sensation of the tasting an apple be to mine?
[19:30:22] <Poeticode> and then you have the issue with our unreliable memories. Perhaps a few moments after the bite you've forgotten portions of the experience already

[19:30:35] <DunceCotus> if its infinitely different, how is any shared information possible
[19:31:09] <DunceCotus> unless we kind of select in a probabilistic way for others who we can share information with
[19:31:34] <DunceCotus> and de-select those who sense things comparatively infinitely differently
[19:32:13] <Poeticode> the color issue is a good example of that DunceCotus . Perhaps for every single person, the color blue is a unique and different color
[19:32:49] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: it likely is

[19:33:03] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: but we still experience the colour blue pretty similarly, broadly speaking
[19:33:12] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: or it has 'cultural cache'
[19:33:34] <DunceCotus> which only works if there's a socius, a social body that encodes these various affects into aggregates
[19:33:43] <DunceCotus> like blue is 'calming' vs. say red

[19:41:20] <Poeticode> i identify houses as apes
[19:41:38] <DunceCotus> that's normal

[19:42:01] <DunceCotus> Shinra: wouldn't surprise me

[19:43:11] <Shinra> he called that our common karma
[19:43:14] <DunceCotus> though I think its still unclear just how much or how little
[19:43:44] <DunceCotus> Shinra: hmm
[19:44:32] <Shinra> just a way of saying we experience similar things
[19:44:56] <DunceCotus> but in different configurations

[19:47:22] <bxgelsan> Shinra, how are you
