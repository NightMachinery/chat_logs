[13:16:24] <bioparco> hello everyone. a quick question. i'd like to go over https despite using thelounge under vpn, does it makes sense ? how should i configure a cert without using certbot? thanks in advance
[13:21:13] *** queria is now known as queria^afk
[13:21:31] *** queria^afk is now known as queria
[13:22:09] <c014> Why not use certbot? it's like the easiest way
[13:24:52] <bookworm> c014: because the thing probably doesn't have a hostname that's reachable from the internet if it is only accessible from the lan of the VPN (aka intranet)
[13:28:01] <bioparco> exactly what bookworm pointed out
[13:28:15] <c014> jaha
[13:28:29] <bookworm> bioparco: make your own CA, add CA to client devices
[13:28:41] *** narf4 is now known as narf
[13:28:43] <bioparco> probably no one would sniff in my intranet so plain http is ok, just being paranoic and wanted to make all https
[13:29:02] <bioparco> ok so i can make my own CA and bundle to local ip range?
[13:29:18] <bioparco> not range sorry, I meant addres
[13:29:28] <bookworm> well, "bundle"... you'd need to install the CA on every device you use, but you also need to do that for the VPN so it's just another thing
[13:29:49] <bioparco> going to try, thank you
[13:29:56] <bookworm> you can with the CA handle out certs for whatever you want, including .local domains or what have you

[13:41:13] <bioparco> second question of the day, is there a way to use EXTERNAL SASL?
[13:41:23] <bioparco> i haven't found anything in official doc

[13:42:42] <bookworm> you mean to auth to the upstream IRC server?
[13:42:55] <bookworm> "only" with a cert, but yes
[13:44:28] <bookworm> actually, SASL EXTERNAL is always with the tls cert it seems, so yes
[13:45:05] <bookworm> client cert (SASL EXTERNAL) in the auth section of the network settings
[13:47:28] *** Quits: botfuzz (~librarian@mariecurie.labrat.space) (Quit: librarian)
[13:50:22] <bioparco> i don't see how to configure the cert in the server "credentials" section

[13:55:42] <bioparco> ouch, found, just need to figure out now how to get the fingerprint
[13:55:42] <bioparco> lol
[13:56:15] <bookworm> the network generally tells you
[13:56:50] <bookworm> some nickserv have the functionality that of you don't manually specify a cert it will use the one you currently connected with
[13:56:55] <bookworm> depends though
[13:56:58] <bioparco> nop, i've found cert files but don't know how to extract fingerprint to add to network settings

[14:08:34] <bioparco> last question to complete my confing and then I won't annoy you, what about SOCKS proxy? is there a way to configure it?
[14:09:07] <bookworm> you aren't annoying, the questions are fine, that's what we are here for
[14:09:44] <bookworm> what do you mean with "what about"? What it is useful for or how to configure it?

[14:10:37] <bioparco> the final resut should be to setup connection over tor to my thelounge instance; i'm one step far; i just need to setup the proxy
[14:11:45] <bookworm> you need to be on the prerelease version iirc (might be wrong) then again in the network settings, enable the "use proxy" checkbox and fill in the details
[14:12:16] <bioparco> mmmh what you mean with "prerelease version iirc" ?
[14:12:27] <bookworm> however, that's TL --> IRC server, not Computer --> thelounge
[14:13:16] <bioparco> yeah, the expected final result will be: pc -> vpn -> tl -> tor -> irc server
[14:14:02] <bookworm> What I mean is that version 4.2 might not have the proxy stuff but 4.3.rc would
[14:14:31] <bookworm> the release is a few days out, so either wait or upgrade now to the release candidate
[14:39:27] <bioparco> going to upgrade rn
