[00:58:01] <manicennui> He doesn't seem especially insightful or good at anything.
[00:59:07] <skyl4rk> no idea, never paid attention to streaming/youtube, I think he started as a streamer at least, dunno if he still does it

[01:48:06] <gwozniak> manicennui: I watched Touch of Evil, one of the few movies Zsa Zsa Gabor was actually acting in.  She has about 20 seconds of screen time.
[01:48:48] <gwozniak> She was the consummate celebrity
[01:49:27] <gwozniak> Was at the dentist and my mouth is now starting to "de-numb"
[01:50:06] <manicennui> gwozniak: She was also an actor in Vienna. Not sure if she did more there.
[01:55:57] <gwozniak> In Touch of Evil she walks down some stairs, says one line, then walks off camera and that's it
[01:56:07] <gwozniak> Of course, the trailer says that she's in it

[01:58:39] <manicennui> I truly believed that he was Indian growing up.
[02:04:46] <gwozniak> Heston makes no attempts at an accent.  He just has a thin moustache and darker skin
[02:05:14] <manicennui> That might be better than his trying.
[02:05:43] <gwozniak> Yeah, adding an accent would have been egregious
[02:10:00] <manicennui> I think it's kind of weird when they hire someone from another country to play a character and do an accent.
[02:10:09] <manicennui> Like, there are plenty of actors from that country.
[02:10:26] <manicennui> It was one thing decades ago, but now it is really weird.

[09:48:48] <gerikson> HN wondering why people don't like nuclear power
[09:48:56] <gerikson> "it is just because of Fukushima?"
[09:49:07] <gerikson> ever heard of Three Mile Island, idiot?
[09:49:36] <manicennui> gerikson: Pretty sure coal has done far more harm.
[09:49:51] <gerikson> ``In 2016, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry estimated the total cost of dealing with the Fukushima disaster at ¥21.5 trillion (US$187 billion), almost twice the previous estimate of ¥11 trillion (US$96 billion).''
[09:50:00] <manicennui> And most of the nuclear plants that had accidents are not modern designs.
[09:50:17] <gerikson> manicennui: the harm of coal isn't visible as much
[09:51:03] <manicennui> I get the concern over nuclear, and also get that it might still be a good option, especially with modern plant designs.
[09:51:13] <gerikson> yeah I do too, in theory
[09:51:24] <gerikson> but for a lot of people, there's a visceral aversion to it
[09:51:31] <manicennui> Yeah, I get that.
[09:51:40] <manicennui> I have that aversion to some extent.
[09:52:00] <manicennui> I certainly wouldn't want to live near a nuclear power plant, but I also don't want to live near any other kind of power plant.
[09:52:04] <gerikson> and it's not irrational considering that 2 major accidents still have ongoing costs
[09:52:08] <manicennui> Except maybe hydro.
[09:52:13] <manicennui> Or geothermal.
[09:52:26] <gerikson> also, it's not as if the US has massive amounts of nuclear power
[09:52:37] <manicennui> gerikson: Perhaps not irrational, but other types of plants have high costs too in pollution and such.
[09:52:41] <gerikson> "it's all due to the cost of regulation!"
[09:53:29] <manicennui> I believe Fukushima in particular suffered from assholes trying to save money.
[09:53:42] <manicennui> In all cases, capitalism is the real concern.

[12:50:41] <buttsbot> Twitter - lexi_lambda - someone asked me in a conversation today to elaborate on why I have such an intensely negative opinion of SICP, and seeing ...
[12:56:32] <Geekingfrog> Not going to lie, I don't really understand that :/
[13:18:35] <gerikson> never read SICP, I personally saw how trying to teach Scheme to undergraduates in 1993 totally fucked up a year's intake at my alma mater
[13:20:07] <Brekkjern> SICP is pretty meh
[13:20:40] <Brekkjern> I bet the people who think of it fondly just haven't been exposed to modern programming tutorials or deeper excursions into the subject matters SICP briefly covers
[13:23:22] <gerikson> I'm sure
[13:24:02] <Brekkjern> It was used in the FP course I had last semester, and I quickly gave up reading the book because it spent several pages trying to tell me how fucking great linked lists comprised of pairs are.
[13:24:12] <Brekkjern> And it's such a trivial point...
[13:25:06] <gerikson> I wonder if there's been serious study on how to teach programming
[13:25:16] <Brekkjern> Probably quite a few
[13:25:21] <gerikson> online discourse seems dominated by just-so stories
[13:25:44] <gerikson> I guess it's similar to math
[13:26:07] <gerikson> a ton of people learn the mechanics of arithmetic, only a few actually delve down into the substrate
[13:26:26] <Brekkjern> Yeah, because it isn't really needed
[13:26:57] <gerikson> yeah and how much PL theory do you need to "program" in general?
[13:27:08] <Brekkjern> Eh. A bit?
[13:27:13] <Brekkjern> Not much though
[13:27:22] <Brekkjern> Depends on the language you are using really
[13:27:28] <gerikson> if you connect to a DB, take action on what's returned, and transform that to a view ... there's very little PLT involved
[13:27:38] <Brekkjern> Indeed
[13:28:14] <Brekkjern> But you have things like joins, filtering, and O notation
[13:28:28] <gerikson> yeah sure
[13:28:33] <Brekkjern> Don't actually need to know how O notation works, but it's helpful to know about the implications of nested loops for example
[13:28:44] <gerikson> yes I can agree with that

[17:58:09] <pja> It’s online if you want to get a taste: https://craftinginterpreters.com/
[17:58:10] <buttsbot> Crafting Interpreters
[17:58:26] <gwozniak> I'm pretty sure I have a copy somewhere.  It's finding the time to read it.
[17:59:05] <pja> The author works on Dart @ Google these days.
[17:59:54] <gwozniak> Haven't heard anything about Dart in a while
[18:00:20] <gwozniak> Probably doesn't help that I am not in the web scene much at all
[18:00:27] <pja> Yes, it’s probably going to tossed into the dustbin of projects that Google got bored with fairly soon.
[18:00:50] <pja> But maybe it gets used a lot by Google internally so it might stick around?
[18:04:06] <gwozniak> So I am slightly concerned some of my coworkers are studying the control flow instead of the data structures in some code we have to analyse and understand
[18:05:21] <gwozniak> And do amend a comment I made some time about about libgccjit, it's probably generating GENERIC, not GIMPLE
[18:05:39] <gwozniak> I say this now because I have been studying them...
[18:06:59] <gwozniak> By the way, here's why working in GCC is so maddening: ``Many, many macros take trees as input and return trees as output. However, most macros require a certain kind of tree node as input. In other words, there is a type-system for trees, but it is not reflected in the C type-system.''
[18:07:45] <companion_cube> pja: I really like the book, but that munificent works on dart is just… sad
[18:08:18] <pja> I imagine Google is paying him a lot more than he could earn in gamedev, so...
[18:09:10] <pja> I remember reading his blog a couple of years ago - it turned out he took 9 months to work out how to program a feature  in Dart that I had something like 2 weeks to deliver in the custom language I was working on at the time.
[18:09:48] <pja> Needless to say, his solution was carefully worked out & elegant, whilst mine was “steal a pile of code from LLVM & hack it till it works.”
[18:10:48] <pja> (Not proud of that code, but it did actually /work/, which is what counts I guess?)
[18:11:32] <companion_cube> what was the feature?
[18:14:20] <pja> LSP support. In particular, line wrapping code so it looks nice when you can set an arbitrary max line length.
[18:14:49] <pja> clang-format, but for a custom language basically.
[18:15:35] <pja> My code inhabits clang-format in much the same way that certain fungi parasitise ants.
[18:16:15] <companion_cube> ah, formatting? off
[18:16:26] <companion_cube> I have no idea how that's typically done
[18:16:34] <companion_cube> you can't just reuse your parser, can you?
[18:16:55] <pja> clang-format has a really nice line wrapping algorithm that works a bit like the TeX paragraph formatter. But I didn’t have time to understand it & re-write it, unlike the Dart guy!
[18:18:35] <pja> So I just ripped out some specific classes in clang-format & replaced them with code that understood the semantics of our language enough to format it nicely. The rest of the code still thinks it’s formatting C++, which makes it wildly bloated compared to a solution written from the ground up, but I didn’t have time for that, so...
[18:20:02] <pja> Strong “Je n’ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n’ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte.” vibes.
[18:20:25] <pja> (quoting Blaise Pascal)
[18:26:07] <pja> companion_cube: I think you could reuse the compiler lexer, but I don’t think clang-format does that. I’d have to go check.
[18:26:44] <companion_cube> right, but you might even need more if you have comments… idk
[18:27:17] <pja> For C/C++ you only really care about brackets "(){}", ";,", and comments. Comments you can wrap a la TeX.
[18:28:38] <pja> But it rapidly gets more complicated when you start messing with macros, lining up strings etc etc etc. It’s pretty much a bag of heuristics held together with string.
[18:29:26] <riv> lining things up is a nightmare
[18:29:47] <riv> I never do it for my own code
[18:31:04] <pja> Just let a formatter do it for you. Much easier :)
[18:31:52] <pja> I’ve got very used to letting an LSP just reformat my code. I’ve become a very lazy code writer - just blast out the syntax, hit return and look! lovely formatted code.
[18:32:34] <riv> yeah, i want indentation 100% automated
[18:35:48] <gwozniak> I do too, except when I don't

[19:18:07] <edm> some work peeps have proposed going through rob nystrom’s ‘crafting interpreters’ at work just for funsies. I’m up for this. the first interpreter is written in java. I have made it to 34 without having ever written a line of java in my life. can anyone recommend an extremely quick guide to java, and its build system, on macos, for someone who isn’t interested in it beyond being able to follow along with the book
[19:18:07] <edm> example? the book expplicitly says ‘i assume you know about makefiles etc so i wont cover it’ but this is not true for me with java
[19:21:45] <pja> Presumably a makefile for java just runs javac on your main classfile?
[19:22:07] <companion_cube> you probably want to use sth like Intellij?
[19:22:16] <companion_cube> it'll also help with the language
[19:22:56] <imode> I didn't want to use IntelliJ. I now see it as an indispensible tool.
[19:23:33] <imode> what you pay for in system resources you gain in language-specific tooling.
[19:23:40] <pja> Of course the Java world loves XML & likes to use tools like Ant instead of make.
[19:23:41] <imode> which is incredibly convenient.
[19:24:01] <companion_cube> tbh make is absolutely terrible
[19:24:17] <pja> Yeah, I think most Java programmers just press “build” in Eclipse or IntelliJ.
[19:24:23] <imode> cmake ain't much better..
[19:24:35] <companion_cube> I think you can use a maven build, but yeah
[19:24:53] <pja> I did grow to like bazel at the last job, but boy was it a pain to get going.
[19:24:53] <companion_cube> imode: I wonder if cmake is bad in the same way C++ is :D
[19:25:09] <companion_cube> like, make just plain sucks, too limited, weird quirks, etc. (like C really)
[19:25:19] <companion_cube> cmake is clearly more modern but it looks so fucking complex
[19:25:40] <imode> having used it, it is fucking complex.
[19:25:42] <imode> for little reason.
[19:25:48] <imode> just use shellscripts, imo.
[19:27:32] <pja> edm: this quick “here’s makefile, now get on with it” article from some US university seems accurate enough: https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/javamakefiles.html
[19:28:11] <edm> i regret asking
[19:28:19] <edm> thanks pja
[19:29:03] <imode> lmao, "I regret asking"
[19:30:27] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: cmake is awful but it’s usually better than the alternatives as far as C++ goes
[19:32:07] <riv> java.. makefile.. =_=
[19:32:09] <riv> what
[19:35:30] <companion_cube> imode: shell scripts won't work on windows, will they? I mean, it's like system vs shell scripts
[19:39:19] <imode> yeh.
[19:41:40] <prussian> Ant brings back memories.
[19:41:51] <prussian> not sure if I like Ant or Make better.
[19:42:04] <edm> riv: i explained it badly
[19:42:38] <edm> half the book is a java interpreter, the other half is a c interpreter, the author explicitly says they are not going into details of build systems etc required for you to follow along at home
[19:42:47] <edm> C is no problem, java i know zilch about
[19:43:11] <edm> except i don't want to have to use some new heavyweight IDE as suggested above just to run textbook examples
[19:44:04] <edm> so i basically want just enough java tutorial, and no more, to be able to follow along at home with implementing an interpreter for this toy language that he develops through the book
[19:48:35] <ngoldbaum> edm: the problem is ~everyone uses an IDE for java
[19:48:50] <ngoldbaum> so you’re not going to find good non-IDE resources most likely
[19:49:15] <edm> but this is like ~2kloc total
[19:49:28] <edm> i can see all the code at once if i turn my monitor vertically
[19:51:33] <companion_cube> you can display 2k lines?!
[19:55:32] <indigo> edm: I have been going through that book using VSCode
[19:56:09] <indigo> I also got tripped up by the “you should know about build systems” part
[19:56:21] <edm> tell me your secrets indigo
[19:56:28] <indigo> I think I just created a new maven project or something in VSCode
[19:59:45] <edm> indigo: are you enjoying the book?
[20:01:51] <indigo> Honestly I kinda stopped for now, life and Java boilerplate got in the way :P
