[00:45:31] <ningu> I know that css properties can be a css-native alternative to preprocessor variables. is there any css native equivalent to sass mixins?
[00:47:28] <hassoon> ningu: remind me what's a sass mixin ?
[00:48:11] <ningu> it's just a fragment of css declarations so for example: color: black; background-color: white;
[00:48:17] <ningu> then you can put it under any selector with @include foo;
[00:48:41] <ningu> a mixin can also be a full selector so like: hr { border: 3px solid black; } and then @include hr_thingy;
[00:49:17] <ningu> my sense is there isn't something in css yet at that level of abstraction/generality

[00:50:10] <hassoon> ningu: there is include other stylesheets anyway
[00:50:44] <ningu> well, yes
[00:50:57] <ningu> but a stylesheet is a full stylesheet. you can't do like: .foo { @include bar; }
[00:50:58] <ningu> right?
[00:53:51] <ningu> now that I think I get how css vars / custom properties work they're really cool
[00:54:03] <ningu> so, will already help me do less sass-specific stuff
[00:54:14] <ningu> just making sure I'm not missing any other recent innovations :)

[02:13:01] <fweht> nbjoerg: i mean with setting the correct z-index?  whats the reason its not  working this way?  something something stacking context, right?
[02:14:09] <fweht> its just weird that it works that the blue thing is above the gray, althoug blue is child of an element behind gray, so why cant green be on top of blue?
[02:15:14] <nbjoerg> because the stack content is already established by the parent element at this point

[02:15:37] <hassoon> where is the green box
[02:15:41] <hassoon> i see red and 2 blues
[02:15:51] <fweht> its not visible, but it has z-index of 30
[02:16:07] <fweht> i still have troubles with understanding stacking contexts
[02:16:09] <nbjoerg> fweht: the z-index of the green box is only relative to its parents
[02:16:12] <nbjoerg> parent
[02:16:13] <hassoon> a yes
[02:16:25] <nbjoerg> fweht: it is not compared relative to the grandparent
[02:16:29] <fweht> ahh ok!
[02:16:51] <fweht> but in case of blue its also relative to the siblings of its parents?
[02:17:14] <nbjoerg> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context
[02:18:13] <nbjoerg> basically, the blue box and the bg-gray-300 box are considered sibling stacks
[02:18:32] <nbjoerg> directly under the body root
[02:19:43] <fweht> but the blue box is child of the red one?
[02:20:07] <fweht> sorry i tried to read the mdn documentation
[02:20:42] <nbjoerg> the red one doesn't establish a stacking context
[02:20:47] <nbjoerg> because it uses the default position
[02:21:43] <fweht> ah ok!
[02:21:48] <fweht> it starts to make sense

[22:15:34] <lantech19446> when making input fields if I float right why does my label move to the right side of the input field, they're bound today with for and id I would have thought they moved as one unit
[22:16:52] <matsaman> lantech19446: link?
[22:19:10] <lantech19446> hold on a sec I've gotta push it to github to give you a link
[22:19:26] <lantech19446> and actually that's not gonna work because i already undid it
[22:19:40] <matsaman> aw yeh
[22:20:11] <lantech19446> it was just something weird when it's not floated it shows up with say username and then input field but when i did float right it went input field and then username
[22:20:51] <lantech19446> ok I can show you I just recreated it give me a sec
[22:22:35] <lantech19446> https://github.com/jherman19446/form
[22:25:24] <matsaman> you might want to use <label><input></label> instead of separate label & input with for & id
[22:25:41] <lantech19446> ok
[22:25:53] <lantech19446> and then they'd be nested and I wouldn't have that issue
[22:31:30] <lantech19446> this is actually a really good exercise, I've done 2 sites one of which was a big redesign but i'm having trouble with the css on this one

[22:41:58] <paule32> the div style
[22:41:58] <lantech19446> nesting didn't work my label goes haywire but it also seems unaffected by my ID when I call that id in css it applies only to the input for some reason
[22:42:05] <matsaman> float is not inherited

[22:43:37] <matsaman> you'd have to make it a sibling instead of a child
[22:43:55] <lantech19446> matsaman: when I nested them <label><input></label> the actual label went off and did its own thing

[22:43:56] <matsaman> <div></div>\n<div></div>
[22:44:18] <matsaman> lantech19446: you've got to target ('select') the label's at that point, instead of the input's
[22:45:03] <lantech19446> ok that makes sense because otherwise i'm invoking an id more than once

[22:55:12] <matsaman> there's a curve just like with anything
[22:55:23] <teut> means what?
[22:55:24] <matsaman> FWIW, though, a lot of people don't use float for layout anymore, they default to flexbox
[22:55:54] <lantech19446> guess i better learn flexbox
[22:56:14] <matsaman> teut: with HTML+CSS? You could use an element with border-radius and transform/rotate it
[22:56:22] <matsaman> teut: or you could use an SVG, inline or backgrounded
[22:56:43] <teut> that transform-rotate thing looks very very difficult
[22:56:47] <matsaman> it's not
[22:56:54] <matsaman> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/rotate()

[22:57:40] <teut> it will be easier to just use the csv

[22:57:58] <matsaman> I think it'd probably be more appropriate to use SVG anyway

[22:58:24] <teut> I have to finish the thing fast
[22:58:51] <lantech19446> Have I just never noticed that most sites don't use labels anymore either?
[22:59:08] <matsaman> mmm, I haven't been checking lately
[22:59:11] <matsaman> many still do not
[22:59:27] <matsaman> many more might use all sorts of JS and nonsense instead because they're ignorant or want finer contorl
[22:59:30] <matsaman> control*
[22:59:39] <matsaman> labels are good
[22:59:58] <matsaman> for a "cute" form you could use the placeholder attribute to do labels
[23:00:11] <matsaman> but you have to realize it might look silly to UA's that don't have eyes
[23:00:13] <lantech19446> I have placeholder as well
[23:00:21] <matsaman> like search engines, the blind, anybody trying to process data logically, etc.

[23:24:06] <matsaman> FlorianBad: mostly just div and span, you shouldn't need more
[23:24:10] <matsaman> div is block, span is inline
[23:25:24] <FlorianBad> matsaman: yeah but if I already use plenty of span and refer to them by order (nth-of-child) and now I have one that wil someone be there and sometimes not, it forces me to use classes everywhere, because that extra span will mess up the order
[23:25:34] <FlorianBad> (and I'm in a label so I can't use div)
[23:26:06] <matsaman> that's true, but using classes is better than abusing empty elements
[23:26:25] <DPA> parent > span:not(.class) ?
[23:26:39] <matsaman> yes, you could give the one that is most likely rarist the id or class
[23:26:41] <matsaman> and exclude it
[23:26:45] <matsaman> or override it after the fact
[23:27:00] <Rockwood> DPA for me?
[23:27:18] <FlorianBad> DPA: lol :)  but I would have to write this a dozen times
[23:27:32] <FlorianBad> that makes more sense to uses classes then
[23:27:53] <FlorianBad> I was thinking about <nav> but that's a bit evil, isn't it?
[23:28:14] <FlorianBad> maybe it's not allowed in labels either
[23:28:30] <DPA> <a> without a href could work
[23:29:50] <FlorianBad> hmm :)
[23:30:08] <FlorianBad> Would a b with font-weight:normal  work too?
[23:30:46] <DPA> Probably.
[23:30:47] <DPA> To avoid repeating CSS selectors manually, templating things like less and sass can also be helpful.
[23:31:03] <lantech19446> matsaman: feel like taking another look at it and tell me if I'm doing this in a poor manner?
[23:33:15] <FlorianBad> DPA: all my css is generated by javascript, I'm writting a content library
[23:34:29] <DPA> Maybe custom elements could also be an option (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
[23:35:31] <DPA> I wonder if a not yet registred custom element (<x-y></x-y>) is allowed in HTML.
[23:36:24] <FlorianBad> lol wow never heard of that, but it seems dangerous ;)
[23:39:52] <DPA> It's awesome, especially together with shadow roots. You get an actual own class constructed when there is a registered element, have mount unmount events almost like in react, and can overly custom html over the thing in a shadow root, which can have even have it's own isolated css styles.
[23:41:32] <DPA> The only downsides are that it's a JS thing, and having to manually register/load the elements/classes.
[23:43:40] <DPA> It can take a lot of experience with DOM to use it sensibly.
