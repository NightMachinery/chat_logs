[00:26:55] <Xe> skrzyp: this is byte-for-byte reproducibility, not general semantics reproducibility
[00:27:10] <technomancy> I'd imagine removing the last 0.01% of non-determinism is extraordinarily difficult
[00:27:51] <Xe> ^
[00:27:56] <skrzyp> Xe: but didn't the while "environment" of Nix directly imply that from the beginning so you can't go wrong there and make it unreproducible?
[00:28:27] <imode> byte-identical builds are useful for verification among other things.
[00:28:38] <imode> it's different than reproducible environments.
[00:29:44] <Xe> skrzyp: it's the difference between getting the same versions of everything to getting the same bytes for everything
[00:29:56] <Xe> build systems are annoyingly non-deterministic
[00:31:56] <ngoldbaum> skrzyp: what about things like buildscripts putting the current time into a file somewhere
[00:32:23] <ngoldbaum> doesn’t actually matter but it does mean some bytes in the final product will change every build
[00:32:40] <imode> good question.
[00:33:15] <imode> you could exclude those in the verification calculations, I guess.
[00:33:27] <skrzyp> ngoldbaum: imode: Of course, but I was pretty much sure they've thought about that from the ground up and introduced the environment which has zero external influence, including setting a time to @0, etc.
[00:33:51] <ngoldbaum> well now they’ve finally finished apparently
[00:34:19] <skrzyp> after all, edolstra wrote a paper about that in... 2003?
[00:34:21] <imode> gg, no re.
[00:34:26] <ngoldbaum> i’m sure there are other weirder sources of non-determinism that are harder to control by carefully setting up the build environment
[00:35:13] <ngoldbaum> all that nix and guix guarantee by construction is that the build configs and dependency trees are reproducible
[00:35:16] <demize> The effort to ensure things are byte-for-byte reproducible are relatively recent.

[13:08:01] <drobilla> I still haven't managed to get through Anathem
[13:08:16] <gerikson> EdwardIII: well enough
[13:08:39] <gerikson> drobilla: I think it falls down a bit after the midpoint
[13:09:07] <EdwardIII> yes it's kind of long and meandering, maybe needed slightly harsher editing. i loved it though
[13:10:09] <drobilla> I enjoyed Cryptonomicon and the Baroque Cycle well enough (bit of a slog, though), but Snow Crash and Diamond Age are where it's at
[13:10:12] <drobilla> But I'm a real sucker for that era
[13:11:32] <EdwardIII> i couldn't get on with Snow Crash, but i'd struggle to say why
