[22:19:19] <philCryo> @__adrian the goal was to write the SQL once -- and then give the users a button that they can self-service click to get the report.  I and others review the SQL to make sure it's ok
[22:19:39] *** BlackIkeEagle_ is now known as BlackIkeEagle
[22:20:04] <philCryo> This report was the first time we came across a request for dynamically aliased columns
[22:20:15] <__adrian> that also doesn't really answer why the aliases can't just be in the sql
[22:20:21] <biberu> how does that lead to needing placeholders for aliases?
[22:20:45] <__adrian> ...they want to rename columns ad hoc for no reason?
[22:21:47] * __adrian shrugs
[22:22:03] <__adrian> write the sql as a template and then replace the aliases before you prepare
[22:22:21] <__adrian> you'll need to be extremely strict with what's allowed as aliases though
[22:24:32] <biberu> indeed, that's very fragile
[22:26:17] <__adrian> less fragile... use an existing, well-maintained and vetted query builder
[22:26:52] <philCryo> Here's what I can reveal: it's for a report where we have columns to show a count of things for each month over the past year.  1st column is sales territory, 2nd column is client, 3rd column is the count of things for the month a year prior to when the report is executed (i.e. now is June 10, 2021, so the 3rd column would be aliased "6" as it is for a count of things for June 2020); 4th column is the
[22:26:54] <philCryo> count for the month after (in the same scenario, it would be for July 2020); 5th column is for count for the month after (August 2020)...all the way until count of things for the current month (keeping the same scenario, since execution is on June 10, 2021, it is count of things for the month of June 2021).  Columns become "sales_territory, client, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6".  If
[22:26:56] <philCryo> someone executes the PHP application in July 2021, columns would be "sales_territory, client, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7". Make sense?
[22:27:36] <__adrian> i'd use month names
[22:27:48] <__adrian> but in the end whether we think that makes sense doesn't matter  :)
[22:28:09] <philCryo> By keeping the query as much as possible in SQL, people who are SQL-knowledgeable can pull the SQl out and muck with it if they want a slightly different report -- and then submit that as either a replacement SQL for the existing report or as SQL for a new report
[22:28:15] <__adrian> it doesn't make the overall idea better, and doesn't magically reveal a better solution
[22:28:36] <philCryo> @__adrian I'm  replicating an existing report on a system that's being retired
[22:28:45] <__adrian> you could simply apply the column names after the fact, you know.
[22:28:58] <__adrian> run the query and then use whatever column names you want when you output the results.
[22:29:23] <__adrian> that wouldn't even need to rely on the user choosing them, in fact.
[22:29:42] <philCryo> @__adrian and whether it was strings or numbers being passed in as SQL-based user-defined variables, MySQLi still doesn't let me use SQL that works just fine in a SQL client
[22:30:05] <philCryo> ...unless somebody knows something I don't
[22:30:11] <__adrian> right. as i said, it doesn't affect the sanity/workability of your problem at all
