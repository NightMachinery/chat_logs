[00:42:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do I get an escaped version of a string in shell
[00:45:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> nm
[00:47:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... so in PHP, there's the urlencode() function
[00:47:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> But if you actually use it to urlencode a string, it doesn't work
[00:47:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why?
[00:47:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Returns a string in which all non-alphanumeric characters except -_. have been replaced with a percent (%) sign followed by two hex digits and spaces encoded as plus (+) signs. It is encoded the same way that the posted data from a WWW form is encoded, that is the same way as in application/x-www-form-urlencoded media type. This differs from the » RFC 3986 encoding (see rawurlencode()) in that for historical reasons, spaces
[00:47:53] <Obormot\Arcturus>  are encoded as plus (+) signs. "
[00:48:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hysterical raisins strike again
[00:49:28] <gwern> most people use some perl or other hack. I use 'urlencode' from the 'gridsite-clients' package

[00:51:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh the shell question

[01:00:53] <gwern> a winning tweet if I ever saw one
[01:00:53] <pompolic> wrt string escaping problems, i think it's a cartesian product of the set of languages used with itself, almost
[01:01:02] <pompolic> you don't need to escape when it's to and from the same language
[01:01:28] <pompolic> but for every other boundary you likely have to escape things differently (and differently both ways)

[03:10:29] <two2thehead> spxtr, ggreer is probably higher on the 'car guy' spectrum than everyone else on this channel. I'd ask him
[03:11:44] <spxtr> mostly looking for critical responses to "not just bikes", r/fuckcars, strongtowns, etc.
[03:15:25] <ggreer> I'm not entirely sure what you're talking about. there are a few insane people who want to get rid of cars, but there are also people who think fluoride is a mind control chemical
[03:15:38] <nshepperd> uh well it seems obvious that cars have some important applications
[03:16:13] <nshepperd> that are not effectively accomplished by bikes, buses or trains
[03:17:18] <spxtr> I'll try to find a synopsis
[03:17:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cars are great actually
[03:17:58] <ggreer> cars do have disadvantages, but in most of the US the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages
[03:18:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah
[03:18:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed this is true even in New York City, which has *by far* the best public transit infrastructure in the country
[03:18:24] <spxtr> the gist is that american car-centrism is bad, and it got this way largely because of lobbying from car companies in like the 40s
[03:18:26] <ggreer> I think long term we'll end up with self-driving electric cars everywhere. traffic will always be an issue, but that can be ameliorated with congestion fees, more roads (especially tunnels), and priority/carpool lanes
[03:18:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Not for everyone though, obviously)
[03:18:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> (e.g. not for most Manhattanites)
[03:18:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But they're a minority of the city's population!)
[03:19:30] <ggreer> I assume all big industries lobby. had it turned out the other way, we'd have people today saying that the train lobbies (or the municipalities that ran the trains) screwed over the car companies
[03:20:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: That gist is dumb though. As ggreer says, the advantages of cars outweigh their disadvantages. Lobbying or no lobbying, that's just a practical fact of life for most Americans
[03:20:14] <ggreer> and the excuses would be similar, but they'd make more sense (better control & tracking of the populace. making people dependent on the state instead of private companies that compete to sell different cars, etc)
[03:20:37] <spxtr> right, they outweigh the disadvantages in america because of 50+ years of creating car infrastructure at the expense of all other infrastructure
[03:20:56] <ggreer> the US is really big. even when places in the US try to build public transportation, it's a nightmare
[03:21:01] <spxtr> car companies buying productive streetcars in big cities in order to trash them so people would drive, etc
[03:21:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Again this reasoning runs right up against New York City and smashes itself to bits on our best-in-country public transit system
[03:21:23] <spxtr> correct, NYC has nice transit
[03:21:33] <spxtr> well, the bike infra isn't great but the rest is good
[03:21:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right, *and cars are still advantageous to own here*
[03:21:44] <ggreer> eh I hated the subway. too many sketchy people and way too many annoying buskers
[03:21:50] <ggreer> bart was much worse though
[03:22:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: It waxes and wanes. Depends when you visited. The MTA under Bloomberg != the MTA under de Blasio
[03:22:48] <spxtr> part of why the US public transit is so bad is because of low population density because of car centrism. if you live in the suburbs you *must* have a car, because there is literally no transit, no sidewalks, and the nearest store is miles away
[03:22:51] <ggreer> the only nice public transportation system I saw was in japan. even then it was expensive. IIRC even with a student discount I paid over $100 each way to take the bullet train from toyko to osaka
[03:22:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yes, even at its worst, the NYC subway system never approached the horror stories of BART
[03:23:11] <spxtr> japan has great transit, so does most of east asia
[03:23:18] <spxtr> so does much of europe, but not quite as nice
[03:23:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Listen, you're regurgitating these standard arguments, but every one of them so far *totally fails to explain NYC*
[03:23:28] <ggreer> taiwan was very nice too, but that's because taiwan & japan are 0th world countries
[03:23:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: You *must* tangle with the actually tough cases or your arguments are worthless
[03:23:48] <pompolic> >europe >great public transit
[03:23:50] <ggreer> I left my camera on a train it taiwan and it was discovered at the end of the line and returned to me
[03:23:56] <pompolic> maybe public transit is inherently bad then?
[03:23:56] <ggreer> *in taiwan
[03:24:14] <ggreer> depends on who you let ride it. if you're homeles in japan or taiwan, you are not getting on the train
[03:24:23] <Betawolf> there is room between 'get rid of cars entirely' and 'design absolutely everything around everyone using a car all the time'. Cars are useful even when you have public transit, but that doesn't mean you need to feed them everything.
[03:24:37] <pompolic> to be fair, brussels' is pretty decent for the 2 spots i go to
[03:24:48] <spxtr> ggreer: I loved taiwan's transit. It was pretty similar to japan. The high-speed rail there was also pretty pricey, like $50 to go the entire length of the country.
[03:25:00] <Ralith> I'm confused as to what "NYC public transit is less bad than other US cities" has to do with the proposition of "car lobbying in the 40s led to most cities having much worse layout"
[03:25:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Like, "low population density because of car centrism" is obviously, ludicrously, *wildly* wrong when it comes to New York City, of all places. And yet almost *half* of households in NYC have a car
[03:25:17] <ggreer> but we can't get europe or east asia's public transportation because we are not those countries. california will spend how many billion dollars on high speed rail and it won't even connect SF & LA
[03:25:33] <ggreer> even if it did, it'd be slower and more expensive than flying between those two cities
[03:25:47] <spxtr> ggreer: I believe that.
[03:26:09] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: isn't half way lower than the national average?
[03:26:09] <pompolic> also this is not about public transit being good or bad but i'm pretty sure i've seen a self-driven subway in Budapest
[03:26:18] <pompolic> drone metro go skreeeee
[03:26:23] <ggreer> even tokyo has 0.45 cars per household
[03:26:42] <ggreer> and that's with the greatest public transportation system in the world and a geriatric population
[03:27:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Yes, but why is it that high?
[03:27:26] <pompolic> i would pay a premium just for being able to set my destination to an arbitrary point and the origin point at my doorstep
[03:27:29] <pompolic> if i could
[03:27:37] <nshepperd> ggreer: so basically cars are an excellent solution to America being a failed state?
[03:28:04] <ggreer> and yet we can still build roads:)
[03:28:19] <adiabatic> nshepperd: getting the fuck out of SF is an excellent solution to SF being a failed city-state
[03:28:25] <ggreer> I think eventually we'll just have self-driving EVs for most of our trips
[03:28:28] <nshepperd> hmm m not so sure about that
[03:28:43] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: the argument isn't to get rid of all cars. I agree that they're useful sometimes. The argument is that, owing largely to historical corruption, it's bad to design cities such that you *must* use a car for almost all tasks.
[03:28:44] <nshepperd> isn't road building productivity way down too
[03:29:05] <ggreer> yeah, but that's because we built most of the roads we need. now it's just maintaining them
[03:30:07] <adiabatic> spxtr: there are no good pro-car blogs because all the pro-car people are busy raising their kids to extol the virtues of single-family detached houses
[03:30:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Granted, but that doesn't constitute an anti-car agenda! You're missing a step in your reasoning, from "it is not the case that you must use a car for almost all tasks" to "it is not the case that many people, like at least half of all people or even more, have cars"
[03:30:54] <spxtr> (btw NY has by far the fewest cars per capita of US states. Go NYC!)
[03:31:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: i.e., if what you want is for there to be much fewer cars than there are now, then making it no longer the case that they're required for nigh-everything does *not* get you there
[03:31:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> As demonstrated by NYC
[03:31:31] <nshepperd> spxtr: if the argument is about city design i don't see what it has to do with hating Tesla
[03:31:32] <ggreer> I do like the idea of flying automated EVs. even if battery capacity was only enough for 15 minutes of flight, you could easily go across a whole metro area in that time
[03:31:34] <adiabatic> spxtr: and me, well, I'm busy with other shit
[03:31:50] <ggreer> and then you wouldn't have issues with traffic since you'd be able to maneuver in 3d space
[03:32:20] <ggreer> sadly this won't happen in a developed country because there is too much bureaucracy around flight
[03:32:24] <nshepperd> if anything you should love Tesla and hope that it drives the responsible ICE companies bankrupt as punishment
[03:33:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: The fact of the matter is that having a car is super, super convenient, for tons of reasons, and no plausible amount of public transit improvement will make a dent in that - unless the public transit is just "communally owned cars"...
[03:35:15] <two2thehead> ggreer, could you guesstimate how far the distance travelled would be in 15 mins?
[03:35:56] <ggreer> propeller planes travel around 100mph so... 25 miles
[03:36:19] <two2thehead> ggreer, +1
[03:36:40] <spxtr> I would've said ~20 miles, accounting for getting up to speed, avoiding other planes, and keeping some in the tank for emergencies.

[03:47:07] <nshepperd> '. “I think public transport is painful. It sucks. Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn’t leave where you want it to leave, doesn’t start where you want it to start, doesn’t end where you want it to end? And it doesn’t go all the time.”' all true
[03:47:35] <spxtr> That's exactly right, in most american cities.
[03:47:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Y...yes?
[03:47:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> But also everywhere else?
[03:48:02] <nshepperd> especially if the other people are normies who hate the idea of peace and quiet, or insane homeless people
[03:48:03] <spxtr> In places with good transit the busses/trains come regularly and are complete enough that they start and end where you want.
[03:48:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> no

[03:48:46] <spxtr> in places with good transit it is cheaper and literally faster to go by train/bus than by car
[03:48:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: And?
[03:49:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: That's orthogonal to what Musk said!
[03:49:35] <spxtr> musk doesn't like public transit because public transit in america sucks. I agree, public transit here does suck
[03:49:46] <spxtr> the solution to that is to improve public transit in america
[03:49:57] <ggreer> people have been trying that forever and it never works
[03:50:00] <spxtr> then you also get less traffic, fewer road fatalities, etc as a happy by-product
[03:50:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Of course another response to that could easily be: "yeah? but isn't that because the city planners there failed to design for cars, *as they should have*, and thereby they've deprived people of freedom to move about as they please?")
[03:50:03] <ggreer> but self driving cars do work
[03:50:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: But again, *everything he said is true everywhere*
[03:50:42] <nshepperd> nah it has qualities of suckiness universally
[03:52:27] <ggreer> I don't disagree that it is possible to run really nice public transportation, but that isn't politically feasible in the US
[03:52:43] <ggreer> because it would require arresting and imprisoning people who jump fare, who eat on the train, etc
[03:53:11] <ggreer> oh and you'd have to build the tracks through urban areas and overcome all the environmental studies and other obstructions
[03:54:54] <spxtr> they already did that with freeways
[03:55:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, and note that even then, *all the stuff Musk says would still be true*!
[03:55:06] <ggreer> yeah but the laws changed since the freeways were built
[03:55:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> None of it would change! Literally none!
[03:55:22] <ggreer> yeah. that's why rich people don't take the bus

[04:01:06] <ggreer> in taiwan it was about 50% cars and 50% trains or busses

[04:03:12] <ggreer> but if private jets were $70,000, hell yeah I'd get one
[04:03:12] <ardent[m]> NYC has decent transit, partially by having such density at its core that you get the benefits of extreme density at the cost of low drivability
[04:03:28] <ardent[m]> haven't been there myself but that is a decent summary of what I've heard secondhand
[04:03:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: In other words, you're saying "in these places where driving isn't a realistic option, public transit is better than driving!" - which might be 100% true, but it does absolutely nothing to diminish, in any way, the bad things about public transit that Musk cites
[04:04:16] <ardent[m]> but yeah "make things less drivable" isn't the ideal; the ideal is to *optimize without needing drivability/bikability*
[04:04:43] <spxtr> there are a few responses. one of which is that rich people drive, so the only people on public transit are poor, so now you don't want to take public transit because there's poor people there.
[04:04:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> n...no
[04:04:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dude
[04:04:56] <spxtr> if you make public transit better then rich people take it and now it's not so bad, eh?
[04:04:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's a dumb response
[04:05:04] <ardent[m]> so then you get a lot more density, easier to walk wherever you need to go or take transit when commuting, at the cost of your car being a half mile away if you even have one

[04:09:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> ardent[m]: Yeah, that's roughly the shape of it
[04:09:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> The full answer is
[04:09:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There exist places in the city such that between the places where non-poor people live and the places where they want to go, the only efficient way to get there is by subway"
[04:10:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This is not the case for buses, because wherever you can take a bus, you can also drive"
[04:10:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Those places are of course "Manhattan" and "upscale residential areas outside of Manhattan" respectively)
[04:10:47] <spxtr> do the busses have their own lanes?
[04:11:03] <quanticle> two2thehead: Is youtube-dl/yt-dlp really that difficult to use? Or do you mean an online mirror?

[04:11:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Sometimes but this almost never makes a serious difference
[04:11:08] <ardent[m]> also re:benefits that come at the expense of driveway-distance car access, IMO elite colleges do it pretty well by putting effectively a whole town in walking distance... there is the small issue of commuting if you were to make a community for adults that way though, but honestly adding a quarter mile walk to a commute isn't that bad of a tradeoff in exchange for cafeteria access, student group style social events, etc
[04:11:41] <spxtr> yeah a large part of why people have such a good time at college is because it's their first time living in a walkable place. also alcohol
[04:12:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, the upshot is that ... well, perhaps not "rich" in the "0.1%" sense, but certainly upper-middle-class and down, *at worst*... people... do indeed take the subway regularly
[04:12:12] <two2thehead> quanticle, for most people command line is a non-trivial filter. I agree with your second statement. potential legal uses are out numbered by potential and probably illegal uses
[04:12:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> In NYC, it is simply not the case that the subway is just full of poor people
[04:13:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> You get socialites, Wall Street types, high-earning techies, etc., who regularly take the subway
[04:13:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> And this does *absolutely nothing* to affect *any* of the things Elon Musk mentions.
[04:13:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Literally: nothing.
[04:13:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> So "if you make rich people take public transit, it won't suck" is just, empirically, totally false
[04:14:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> There isn't even any obvious mechanism for it to be true! (Which is obvious in retrospect, knowing the actual reality already)
[04:15:19] <quanticle> Here's a real question: if I don't drink, why should I care about walkability? I remember asking some people a while ago about why they liked living in walkable neighborhoods and the one practical benefit they could all agree on was, "Oh, I don't have to think about transportation when I go to the bar; I know I can walk home."
[04:15:21] <quanticle> To which my reply was, "Well, that's all well and good for you, but I don't drink, so what benefit do I get from walkability?"
[04:15:23] <quanticle> And they didn't really have one.
[04:15:25] <quanticle> I'll also note that when I moved to Seattle, I did live in a supposedly walkable neighborhood (Belltown) and I hated it. Hated it enough to move to Bellevue for permanent housing. A very large part of the reason I hated Belltown is because it was noisy af at night from all the aforementioned people walking home after drinking at night.
[04:15:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: I mean... I don't go out to bars but I very much like walkability
[04:16:30] <spxtr> Belltown is indeed walkable, but yeah don't live there if you want a quiet life. Same with cap hill.
[04:16:33] <two2thehead> I think walkability has a major effect on socializing for the general population
[04:16:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just live in a walkable neighborhood that *isn't* full of college-age hipsters and bars that serve college-age hipsters
[04:16:38] <spxtr> ^^
[04:17:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh and just in general, don't live on a commercial avenue
[04:17:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, ever
[04:17:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Live a couple blocks off, in the middle of a nice chunk of purely residential lots
[04:17:39] <spxtr> I live ~5 min walk from a grocery store. It's quite convenient to not need to get in the car, drive to a place, park, shop, then do the reverse when I just need to pick up some eggs or whatever.
[04:18:00] <spxtr> It's just.. nicer to walk than to drive, for this trip.
[04:18:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> I live like a block away from my favorite bagel shop and my favorite pizza place and my favorite VICTORY MEAT CENTER etc.
[04:18:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is great
[04:18:18] <quanticle> two2thehead: I suppose it'd be possible to put a GUI front-end on top of yt-dlp. However, while there are youtube-downloader sites out there (all of whom, so far as I can tell, just use youtube-dl on the backend), they're all rather precarious and tend to vanish without warning as various copyright authorities catch up with them.
[04:18:55] <two2thehead> yep
[04:19:32] <spxtr> (also biking to this grocery store is actually faster than driving because there's a red light in between that's not instrumented. can take 5+ minutes to switch, but you can go on the sidewalks on bike and skip it entirely)

[05:24:28] <PlanckWalk> Though for some odd reason the council only put pavements on one side of most of the streets.

[05:25:18] <spxtr> they don't need nearly as much maintenance as streets
[05:25:54] <PlanckWalk> There's one stretch where you have to cross three extra roads because the side with the pavements is also the side with more intersections.
[05:28:02] <PlanckWalk> Also it means that pavements just end at a corner, and you have to cross to the other side and cross back along a number of routes.

[05:34:32] <spxtr> that's why they get bumpy and such so fast
[05:35:09] <quanticle> I don't know where you live, but I've seen sidewalks being constructed here, and they are definitely *not* concrete slabs slapped down on the dirt by the side of the road. Here the sidewalks are dug and graded, almost as if they were little roadways.
[05:35:16] <PlanckWalk> For Australia, "average road project costs were around $5.1 million per lane kilometre in 2017."
[05:35:18] <spxtr> huh, cool
[05:35:23] <spxtr> that's not the case here
[05:36:09] <gwern> I could see it going either way. sidewalks are very custom to the local and small-scale. you don't see sidewalk-laying machines
[05:36:47] <PlanckWalk> At can go down to only a million dollars per lan-kilometre for the lowest class paved roads

[10:22:49] <PlanckWalk> That's totally wrong.
[10:22:51] <nshepperd> basically true
[10:22:55] <saturn2> i think obormot just has normal size spiders
[10:23:07] <PlanckWalk> "The" giant spider implies just one.

[10:43:52] <quanticle> Haha
[10:43:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Most of the photos are sadly blurry because the spiders are so tiny
[10:44:19] <quanticle> "TSMC’s business is dominated by the chips it makes for smartphones, which accounted for $6.92 billion in of sales in the fourth quarter of 2021, which was 44 percent of total sales, but the HPC segment is a close second with $5.82 billion in revenues in the period, which is 37 percent of revenues. Revenues from etching smartphone chips were down 8.4 percent in Q4 2021, which was better than
[10:44:21] <quanticle> the typical seasonal decline, while sales in the HPC segment were up 26.7 percent, largely through high demand for top-end CPUs and GPUs."
[10:44:35] <quanticle> Just goes to show how hard Intel got screwed by missing out on making smartphone chips.
[10:44:41] <kuudes> quanticle, how much of that comes from taiwan selling commons to tmsc in order to survive against china?
[10:45:43] <quanticle> Eh, it doesn't seem like that much? Like I posted with the quote above, a lot of it is just TSMC being in the right place at the right time as both smartphones and GPU compute took off, neither of which were well-handled by existing chip foundries.

[10:48:12] <PapuaHardyNet> specifically, if my friend ended up happily living with his trans gf that he ran away from his home to live with, then Gurkenglas wins the bet
[10:48:14] <kuudes> but I am not sure of the larger situation
[10:48:21] <kuudes> it just smells like that to me

[10:50:49] <kuudes> the friend has to voice regret of the decision

[10:55:20] <quanticle> Yeah, but I'd be really surprised if Apple came out with a new laptop announcement between today and 2022-07-01
[10:55:29] <rmmh> As he was returning to his cell to pick up his spare rags, his cellmate remonstrated with him: "Now that was really stupid. You know you can't teach that horse to sing, no matter how long you try." Nasrudin's response: "Not at all. I have a year now that I didn't have before. And a lot of things can happen in a year. The king might die. The horse might die. I might die. "And, who knows? Maybe
[10:55:30] <rmmh> the horse will sing."
[10:56:15] <quanticle> Good quote, and fair point.
[10:59:02] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes: oh all right, I've asked him if he regrets it. Let's see his answer
[11:07:36] <saturn2> why would apple come out with a new laptop with USB A?
[11:09:22] <quanticle> Why would they come out with a new laptop that's 1) almost a quarter inch thicker than their previous model 2) has an SD-card reader and 3) has an HDMI port?
[11:09:43] <quanticle> i.e. they brought back a bunch of other stuff, I figured USB-A would be along for the ride.
[11:10:04] <quanticle> They also got rid of the touchbar, completely and have full-height function keys.
[11:10:20] <saturn2> i see
[11:11:55] <quanticle> I like it a lot except for one thing: I don't know what Apple did with its new Mini-LED displays or whatever, but looking at one of the new Macbook Pros' screens for longer than 5 minutes or so causes my eyes to hurt.

[21:10:30] <ggreer> but 9 hours in, it's only 32% complete
[21:10:36] <feep> cdda is pretty good, dev wise
[21:10:45] <feep> but it 100% relies on volunteers, with the attendant problems
[21:11:52] * gwern kinda imagines ggreer's gf like moms on mother's day. "oh honey, it's very impressive"
[21:12:16] <ggreer> she's actually super stoked. this is just a print to make sure it works. next I'll use the magenta filament
[21:13:30] <feep> ggreer: this is clearly the right time to switch to a custom built firmware with support for pressure advance and resonance compensation
[21:13:34] <feep> then crank up dat speed
[21:13:47] <ggreer> I haven't tried printing faster than 80mm/sec
[21:14:15] <feep> do you even live at that speed
[21:14:37] * feep checks what he has
[21:14:50] <ggreer> I like prints that look decent
[21:15:06] <feep> okay well it's set to 500
[21:15:14] <feep> but I think it's limited by extruder speed
[21:15:36] <feep> ggreer: srsly, the whole point of pressure advance is you get the same quality at higher speeds for free
[21:15:38] <ggreer> wtf do your prints look like?
[21:15:48] <feep> kinda shitty tbh lol
[21:15:56] <feep> but I blame that mostly on my pla being like a year old
[21:16:44] <feep> anyway marlin does have pressure advance support
[21:16:53] <feep> but for anti-ringing you'll probably need klipper
[21:17:08] <feep> still, pressure advance is basically a free win, go tune it in
[21:17:24] <ggreer> thanks for the tip
[21:17:51] <feep> https://marlinfw.org/docs/features/lin_advance.html assuming you have marlin fw
[21:17:52] <Robomot> Linear Advance | Marlin Firmware (Nozzle pressure control to improve print quality)
[21:21:40] <feep> basically the idea is the firmware tries to actively manage pressure in the printhead, including creating underpressure, so that the E axis controls extruded plastic rather than the extruder motor
[21:22:23] <feep> on the assumption that a bowden printer (the ones with a plastic tube with pla fiber in, basically every cheap printer) will have some amount of pressure lag from motor to extruder tip
[21:22:48] <feep> (the exact value you usually just find out with a test print)
[21:25:20] <feep> anyway, then resonance compensation is that often the frame will swing a little, creating wave patterns on straight walls after a corner. when planning acceleration, the firmware determines those frequencies and filters them out 
[21:25:35] <feep> that's really only useful for ~speedy~ prints.
[21:26:08] <feep> ggreer: oyeah, do you have octoprint yet
[21:26:20] <ggreer> no. I like having my printer be offline
[21:26:27] <feep> yes? octoprint is local
[21:26:46] <feep> you can port forward it, but you don't have to, and it's still useful
[21:26:47] <ggreer> yeah and my local network is connected to the internet
[21:26:57] <ggreer> and I'd definitely port forward if I set it up
[21:26:59] <feep> especially with marlin, cause you can remove sd cards from the firmware, save some space
[21:27:35] <feep> but also cause it lets you hook up a lot of extra stuff like webcam based progress videos :D
[21:27:44] <ggreer> I'm wary of fucking with the firmware. this printer works pretty good
[21:27:47] <feep> and completion time prediction
[21:28:08] <feep> ggreer: okay, fair I guess. first thing I did with mine was open it up and flash a patchable bootloader :D
[21:28:36] <ggreer> I set up a tripod and put my phone on time lapse https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/nXMUoUm1/IMG_1624.MP4
[21:28:37] <Robomot> video/mp4 (1.8 MB)
[21:29:06] <feep> that works too, but octoprint can do stuff like park the printhead at a fixed offset before screenshotting
[21:29:33] <feep> ggreer: oyeah the big thing for me
[21:29:41] <feep> octoprint can automatically turn off the power if the printer faults.
[21:30:03] <feep> (assuming you have a flashed smart socket)
[21:30:20] <feep> I think that's why I got it to begin with
[21:30:29] <feep> so in case of fire, I could check the webcam from work and hit the power switch
[21:30:50] <ggreer> that is pretty neat. so far I haven't had a bad print. if the first few layers are good, the whole thing is good
[21:30:57] <feep> yeah that's how it tends to go
[21:32:41] <feep> what I use in addons is just tasmota (smart socket support), smart preheat, print time prediction, and a filament manager that checks if I have enough on the spool for the print
[21:33:11] <feep> also the rpi runs the printer driver, cause there's a custom firmware that rewrites like 80% of the printer firmware in python
[21:33:18] <feep> p much all the not time critical bits
[21:33:32] <feep> so the firmware flashed on the printer is just a motor action queue
[21:33:49] <feep> klipper ftw
[21:34:19] <feep> I saw that idea and was like: "... why doesn't everyone do that"
