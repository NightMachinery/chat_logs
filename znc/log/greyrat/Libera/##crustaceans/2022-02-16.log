[04:28:01] <gwozniak> We are interviewing a couple people in the next two days and we were working on questions
[04:28:17] <companion_cube> after the merge with twitter, they'll be the mentwats
[04:28:28] <gwozniak> I'm much more a fan of having them read some code and talk about than write some algorithms
[04:28:46] <gwozniak> *talk about it
[05:07:32] <imode> gwozniak: agreed.

[05:24:14] <gwozniak> I tried refactoring some parts of the linker the last couple days and it broke an awful lot, but the good part is I learned the code structure pretty well
[05:24:23] <gwozniak> Despite it being downright awful
[05:24:41] <gwozniak> Adjusting it so it doesn't suck will be a fair bit of work
[05:25:07] <gwozniak> I was hoping I could get the start of it happening in a small patch but it's kind of an "all or nothing" affair

[06:24:52] <bontaq> same, why not something more fun like metatarsals
[06:25:14] <imode> you'd get a lot of "wanna bone" jokes.
[06:25:53] <companion_cube> I just notice they're not very metabright
[06:26:31] <bontaq> oh no not wanna bone jokes
[06:32:39] <bontaq> I just hope someone in management at another company takes the wrong message from metamates and tells them to refer to coworkers in some other overly friendly way

[07:00:26] <kline> man
[07:00:29] <kline> this makes me sad
[07:27:20] <cb> honestly the amoount of shit that will be MASSIVELY confused by this seems more effort to replace than just rolling out v6
[07:32:25] <kline> same
[07:32:39] <kline> and i also think the inclusion of only a SINGLE loopback address in ipv6 was a mistake as well
[07:33:15] <kline> i cant understand how we give out /64s as the default allocation claiming ipv6 addresses are cheap but then dont give a /64 for loopback
[07:33:21] <kline> i just want 127::/64 already
[07:49:04] <Church> Really?
[07:49:08] <Church> That's so bizzare...
[07:49:23] <Church> Also hadn't realized they only gave a single address for loopback...
[07:57:04] <gwozniak> I don't even know if my ISP supports IPv6
[08:14:48] <imode> oh jesus christ gwozniak I thought that was just a hypothetical.
[08:14:56] <imode> metamates.
[08:15:07] <imode> that's fucking hilarious.
[08:20:22] <kline> gwozniak, mine doesnt, so i tunnel through he.net
[08:58:29] <imode> what's a singular noun that can cover both a source and a sink.
[08:58:33] <imode> need something to name this fucking package.
[08:58:56] <imode> that contains both sources and sinks.
[09:00:41] <imode> channels? that's a little loaded. pipes? eh.
[09:28:40] <gerikson> sewers

[16:43:38] <gerikson> ``Way back in the 90's I reached a conclusion that a programmer or sysadmin or hardware guy is now just the new auto mechanic.''

[16:44:13] <gwozniak> Do you have to be nice to people?
[16:44:35] <gerikson> fuck if I know
[16:44:43] <gerikson> oh, now "IT" is a "trade"
[16:44:44] <gerikson> again
[16:45:01] <gerikson> I have the deepest respect for someone rocking up to a house and building a fucking bathroom
[16:45:09] <gerikson> if you think that's demeaning, soulless work
[16:45:13] <gerikson> you are an idiot
[16:45:29] <gwozniak> Fuck, I have respect for the person who cleans the apartment building I live in
[16:45:35] <gerikson> you got code to keep track of, dealing with site problems, planning etc etc
[16:45:41] <gwozniak> I say hi to them all the time
[16:45:44] <gerikson> all normal people do
[16:45:55] <gwozniak> They do a lot of hard, thankless work
[16:46:00] <gerikson> we have a cleaner at the office
[16:46:14] <gerikson> who was freaked out when she accidentally broke a plate
[16:46:28] <gerikson> and we were like are you kidding? y
[16:46:36] <gwozniak> My wife and I got them gift cards at Christmas until the management said we couldn't do that anymore
[16:46:36] <gerikson> ou're doing great work every day
[16:46:42] <gerikson> :(
[16:46:51] <gerikson> mgmtn sucks then
[16:47:02] <gwozniak> So we left gift cards for anyone down in the lobby instead
[16:47:06] <gerikson> :D
[16:47:35] <gwozniak> Broke a plate? Man, we *all* break stuff at some point
[16:48:13] <gwozniak> If you are handling things all day, it's bound to happen
[16:49:28] <gwozniak> The thing is it doesn't take much to be nice to people

[16:54:38] <bontaq> that's such a weird things for management to say you shouldn't do
[16:54:52] <gwozniak> Some sort of favouritism thing
[16:55:09] <gwozniak> So we will continue to leave random gift cards in the lobby
[16:55:34] <gwozniak> The gift cards are for the coffee place nearby that they go to
[16:56:41] <bontaq> nice
[16:57:56] <gwozniak> The maintenance person who fixes things in apartments has a crazy job.  I'm always super nice to them if I need them to come deal with something.
[16:58:40] <gwozniak> You are basically on call all the time and likely have to deal with stressed people.  Potential powder kegs every day
[16:59:06] <gwozniak> There's no way they are paid enough, I'm sure
[17:00:02] <gwozniak> We've had three or four of them in the last 6 years.  We always learn their names and just say hi when we see them
[17:00:38] <gwozniak> Just basic stuff like that seems to help.  I mean, they tell us they appreciate it after a while
[17:04:11] <gerikson> speaking of, I need to get some clear duct tape to repair our freezer drawer
[17:11:36] <gerikson> ``If it wasn’t for Uncharted on PlayStation, I’d probably never have learned about Sir Francis Drake’s piracy on behalf of Queen Elizabeth I''
[17:12:05] <gerikson> to be fair, unless you had a British English primary school education, it's not well known
[17:16:28] <gerikson> Uncharted the movie, will it bomb?
[17:16:47] <gerikson> never played the game, I guess it's well placed for a movie adaption
[17:17:59] <gwozniak> I don't think I've ever heard of it
[17:21:09] <riv> how you all getting on today? :)
[17:24:43] <gerikson> gwozniak: haha, it's a Playstation exclusive, and the series used to be(?) a hero product for the console
[17:25:03] <gerikson> aided by the smooth voice acting of Nathan Fillion
[17:29:58] <gerikson> it's a bit weird that there's been multiple Tomb Raider movies but not Uncharted
[17:30:10] <gerikson> from what I've gleaned they're similar in tone and setting
[17:32:04] <gerikson> ``Robbery, kidnapping, and murder all qualify as piratical activities, provided there’s some water and a boat involved. If there’s no water and no boat, you’re just a regular bandit. If there’s a boat but no water, you need to go back to pirate school.''

[19:35:31] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: uncharted 1 is just ok, it was a ps3 launch game and suffered for it; uncharted 3 was just kinda samey, they upped the production values and pathos in 4 which helped a lot
[19:35:50] <ngoldbaum> ofc i like story heavy gameplay light games, a lot of people disagree with me on that
[19:42:54] <kline> bruh just get a choose your own adventure book
[19:43:20] <kline> im guessing this is coming out of the new film announced?
[20:05:56] <indigo> Brekkjern: I liked Into Darkness, but the latest one... woof
[20:06:29] <Brekkjern> Into Darkness was... OK, but the ending just solved death, so what potential drama could ever top that?
[20:06:54] <gwozniak> Star Trek 2, 4, 6, and First Contact kept the pattern
[20:07:15] <indigo> Red Letter Media has some great reviews of the Star Trek movies :D
[20:11:10] <indigo> How goes life, Brekkjern
[20:11:20] <Brekkjern> Sick :(
[20:12:07] <Brekkjern> Basically just been scrolling on reddit, or watching series while lying on the sofa since saturday.
[20:12:24] <indigo> Woof, that sucks dude :( I hope you feel better
[20:12:29] <indigo> COVID or just regular sick
[20:12:42] <Brekkjern> I haven't tested positive, so has to be some flu
[20:13:09] <Brekkjern> Which is interesting since a colleague I worked with last week has tested positive...
[20:13:27] <indigo> Heh
[20:14:43] <Brekkjern> But at least I've had time to watch some series I've been meaning to see
[20:15:43] <indigo> That's good! Any recommendations?
[20:15:54] <Brekkjern> Eh, not really :P
[20:15:58] <indigo> Hehe
[20:16:10] <indigo> We've been re-watching True Detective S1
[20:16:32] <Brekkjern> I've finished Vinland Saga, and started on Attack on Titan. So far both have been mid.
[20:17:42] <Brekkjern> I don't really have energy for anything all that more engaging right now, so they are fine for now.
[20:18:20] <indigo> For sure
[20:18:29] <indigo> Yeah, stuff like True Detective kinda requires your brain
[20:20:04] <indigo> Seems like everyone is rushing to cancel mask mandates here in the states
[20:20:14] <indigo> I don't doubt we'll get another wave of... something after that
[20:20:37] <Brekkjern> Well, there are no covid restrictions left in Norway now, other than "stay home if you are sick, and preferrably use a mask when you can't keep distance"
[20:21:04] <Brekkjern> Seems to be fine since we are mostly vaccinated, and the latest strains don't seem to hit as hard.
[20:21:38] <indigo> No masks?
[20:21:50] <Brekkjern> No mandates, no.
[20:22:09] <Brekkjern> Plenty of people still use them, but a lot of people don't
[20:22:26] <indigo> I'm going to miss working remotely when everyone has to go back, heh
[20:22:30] <Brekkjern> Funnily enough, the people who don't seem to be the ones who will end up with the shittiest results if they get infected :P
[20:23:07] <Brekkjern> I never worked remotely, so the difference has been noticeable for me. The tube is way more crowded now.
[20:27:16] <indigo> That's neat that Oslo has such an accessible metro
[20:27:58] <Brekkjern> The design is a bit annoying, but it works. I'd rather have it than not :P
[20:40:28] <dmc[m]> https://i.redd.it/0uheetvmb6i81.jpg
[20:40:50] <Brekkjern> Do they have compatible ports, or does that not matter?
