[00:47:30] <remanifest> hello everyone. I've been dealing witha strange issue on Arch for a while (7-10 days), and I'm not sure how to troubleshoot it. When I boot my computer, everything is fast and normal. SDDM loads, and I enter my username and password. Next, the loading graphic stays on screen for about a minute. After that, KDE or Gnome loads, but with very apparent
[00:47:30] <remanifest>  problems. Applications take a while to launch, if they launch at all. I can't really "use" the system like that. Everything's up to date in Pacman. If I try to "sudo" in the terminal, I'm never prompted for a password either. No issue in a chrooted environment. I thought it was KDE related at first, so that's when I threw Gnome on the system. Next
[00:47:31] <remanifest> , I added a new user account, thinking maybe it was user-specific. Any ideas where I may be able to start with troubleshooting?
[00:48:28] <stonk> While i'm here - anyone have an issue with docker taking like 30-60 seconds to start?

[07:40:32] <sanchex> I am running Arch KDE w/ Wayland on a Dell XPS laptop, Systemd bootloader. My problem started about 2 weeks ago the morning after a full update. It manifests in these ways:
[07:40:32] <sanchex> 1. Wireless network connection fails 2. Most apps fail to spawn a window, a process is created but never uses much memory or progresses much. 3. Logging in when the failure has occured takes a very long time (10x normal) 4. The DE repeatedly becomes unresponsive 5. When shutting down, the OS is unable to kill running processes, the shutdown process runs for at least 15 mins (longest I have left it running)
[07:40:32] <sanchex> The failure can be reliably reproduced by putting my laptop to sleep and waking it up again. It also occurs ~10% of the time on fresh boot and for the first time, tonight, in the middle of normal usage.
[07:40:34] <sanchex> journal kernal logs: https://bpa.st/ZS6A. From line 130 is when I put my laptop to sleep and wake it up again.
[07:41:13] <Namarrgon> sanchex: are you running iwd and nm at the same time?
[07:42:14] <sanchex> I am running nm, I don't know if iwd is also running

[13:05:12] <Fernando-Basso> tirnanog: Thanks. That showed my the PROMPT_COMMAND variable. No surprises there. However, I saw that there is also _ksi_prompt_command. Did declare -p _ksi<Tab>, got _ksi_prompt, and it is related to kitty. Kitty is indeed adding some stuff to my ~/.bashrc every time I open a new kitty instance, it re-adds that stuff to .bashrc, commenting that out (and just open new tabs or other terminals (not kitty) makes the problem disappear.

[13:05:33] <espresso> some nonmatches still slip in; one could play with some redirection
[13:06:21] <Fernando-Basso> Strangely, z has not had an upgrade for a long time. I guess it is kitty doing some funny business with PROMPT_COMMAND that does not cause a problem unless it z comes into the mix (which also changes PROMPT_COMMAND).

[13:14:38] <Fernando-Basso> My first guess is that z is ending with a ";", and perhaps kitty, preppends a ";" before setting its thing.
[13:15:59] <tirnanog> probably something along those lines, yes.
[13:16:02] <Fernando-Basso> I know some older js folks started some stuff with a "defensive" ";" to avoid code spilled from previous parsed files to causing problems (because there were two or three edge cases where it could happen).

[15:44:47] <MrElendig> invra: depends on what you want
[15:45:10] * MrElendig recommends virtio/spice if you are not on nvidia
[15:45:19] <invra> im on nvidia
[15:45:25] <teraflops> if the host is intel gpu you can use https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Intel_GVT-g
[15:45:26] <phrik> Title: Intel GVT-g - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[15:45:38] <MrElendig> can try it with nvidia too, but its a bit more finnicky atm
[15:45:57] <invra> i jsut need to start X no need for fancy things
[15:46:00] <MrElendig> amd and nvidia swap position every 6 months or so on which of them breaks 3d acceleration trough virtio/spice
[15:46:46] <MrElendig> depending on the guest os the selection might be smaller too, not all implements ^

[15:51:16] <MrElendig> its horrible but at least its supported on most guests
[15:51:29] <MrElendig> out of the box even in many cases
[15:51:35] <teraflops> if you want 3d accel at som extend use virtio ans install virglrender on the guest
[15:51:52] <teraflops> some extent^ 
[15:52:14] <MrElendig> while virtio gives you either better 3d acceleration or a nicer alternative to vnc for remote display

[19:29:00] <masoudd> [-_-], search for pkgver in man 5 PKGBUILD: The pkgver variable can be automatically updated by providing a pkgver() function in the PKGBUILD that outputs the new package version.

[19:30:59] <grawity> Rogach: 'systemd.debug-shell' starts the whole OS *plus* a rescue shell; 'rescue' is the traditional single user mode that starts init with minimum services (udev primarily); 'emergency' still starts init but no services at all (though still have the option of starting them manually); and 'init=' replaces the init system outright with just the shell

[22:37:35] <seventyfour> The problem only shows itself when the touchpad is set to "basic" in the bios. If it's set to "advanced", idma64 doesn't appear in powertop and the power draw is normal, however, the touchpad does not work in any capacity.

[23:49:03] <pun> I just noticed atool was removed from the repos. What's a cli alternative unp ? 
[23:49:12] <TheArcaneBrony> maybe a dumb question, but where can i find old versions of arch packages?
[23:49:13] <seventyfour> Warepire: yes https://bpa.st/raw/NMSQ
[23:49:29] <TheArcaneBrony> archive.archlinux.org seems to be struggling
[23:50:04] <seventyfour> TheArcaneBrony: /var/cache/pacman/pkg?
[23:50:08] <Namarrgon> TheArcaneBrony: what are you trying to do?
[23:50:32] <TheArcaneBrony> trying to download postgresql 12 so i can upgrade my data from windows
[23:50:43] <TheArcaneBrony> but pg_upgrade requires old bins
[23:51:12] <Namarrgon> "old bins"?
[23:51:14] <TheArcaneBrony> old binaries
[23:51:20] <Namarrgon> which ones?
[23:51:25] <TheArcaneBrony> for postgresql 12
[23:51:33] <TheArcaneBrony> upgrading 12 -> 13 requires the postgresql 12 binaries
[23:51:48] <Namarrgon> you know wabout postgresql-old-upgrade?
[23:52:17] <MrElendig> TheArcaneBrony: might want to read the upgrade section on the postgres page on the wiki
[23:52:42] <TheArcaneBrony> im following the upgrade section on the wiki
[23:53:05] <Warepire> seventyfour: No dell_wmi messages in that log
[23:53:23] <Namarrgon> TheArcaneBrony: please post the exact errors you get from pg_upgrade
[23:53:31] <seventyfour> that's right. that wmi message only   appears on hotplug of the AC (usbc power)
[23:53:42] <TheArcaneBrony> none, i dont have the postgres old bins
[23:53:43] <Warepire> Ah, I see.
[23:54:00] <TheArcaneBrony> though the arch archive started responding again
[23:54:09] <Namarrgon> TheArcaneBrony: did you install postgresql-old-upgrade?
[23:54:47] <seventyfour> I'm just quite suprised that nothing is logged when IRQ #16 starts going crazy

[23:57:57] <[-_-]> When I booted with sdcard inserted in slot, it showed up
[23:58:13] <[-_-]> but as I removed it, and reattached it, it is not showing
[23:58:20] <TheArcaneBrony> no i didnt, buti  have binaries now
[23:58:24] <TheArcaneBrony> `could not open version file "/var/lib/postgres/data/PG_VERSION": No such file or directory`
[23:58:48] <seventyfour> Warepire: wonder if that eeprom stores bins for the USB-C power management IC
[23:59:10] <TheArcaneBrony> alright, i missed the step of doing initdb, now i get `The source cluster was not shut down cleanly`
[23:59:44] <[-_-]> note, it did not showup the first time
