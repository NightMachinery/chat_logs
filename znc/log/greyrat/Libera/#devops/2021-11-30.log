[00:35:42] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: i dont suppose you know where to find the default sources.list in debian as its installed in a fresh vanilla debian installation (bullseye), without actually installing the distro?
[00:35:51] <rawtaz> i figure it would be in some source control but aint really finding it
[00:36:21] <rawtaz> the closest is https://sources.debian.org/src/apt/2.2.4/vendor/debian/sources.list.in/ so far, still working on it

[01:34:06] <lantech19446> what rawtaz said
[01:35:13] <Latrina> about what? I am not following
[01:36:41] <rawtaz> Latrina: you asked what a CLI is and we answered that
[01:37:03] <rawtaz> oh wait i get you now
[01:37:25] <rawtaz> lantech19446: what were you asking Latrina if it was a CLI?
[01:37:31] <rawtaz> what were you asking about
[01:39:52] <lantech19446> illumos omniOS
[01:42:42] <Latrina> uhm, the installation yes
[01:43:08] <Latrina> I think you can install X11 + a window manager or whatever using either pkg or pkgsrc
[01:43:17] <Latrina> but, I don't even bother 
[01:43:32] <Latrina> why would you need the UI for?
[01:44:13] <Latrina> unless the goal is to use it as desktop.
[01:44:27] <lantech19446> I was just wondering, I have a bash shell so I don't really need it but i'm used to unix having a DE by default because of solaris and freeBSD used to come with gnome
[01:45:10] <Latrina> X and a DE are optional on FreeBSD
[01:45:26] <Latrina> Solaris, the full install comes with Gnome, sure
[01:47:07] <lantech19446> maybe i'm thinking of openBSD one of them used to come with gnome
[01:49:06] <Latrina> you have the option to install a graphic environment with any of these systems
[01:49:18] <Latrina> OpenBSD default DE is Xfce4 btw
[01:58:28] <lantech19446> maybe I'm not remembering it correctly idk it was a long time ago but I don't even remember having to install the DE I thought I downloaded an iso which contained it already and I could have sworn it was gnome

[14:25:48] <latr_work> good morning 
[14:26:01] <latr_work> how are we doing today?
[14:43:00] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: yeah i hear you. but that article etc isnt a proper source. im literally looking for a default example, not "it should contain this and this" :)
[14:43:23] <latr_work> hi rawtaz 
[14:44:14] <rawtaz> but the file is probably built up during install time so meh
[14:44:16] <rawtaz> Latrina: lo
[14:44:17] <rawtaz> err
[14:44:20] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: They show defaults.
[14:44:22] <latr_work> remotes::install_github("ShixiangWang/sigminer")
[14:44:23] <rawtaz> latr_work: lo
[14:44:24] <latr_work>  remotes::install_github("ShixiangWang/sigminer")
[14:44:27] <latr_work> wrong shell
[14:44:32] <kwilczynski> :)
[14:44:38] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: yes but its not the same thing - i cannot trust that the article is updated properly. it's a hand made thing isnt it
[14:44:38] <latr_work> rawtaz: yes I am Latrina
[14:44:59] <kwilczynski> There is no package that carries these files so there is no really a proper way to recover these.
[14:45:21] <kwilczynski> You can try Debian build systems as they often store configuration files.
[14:45:44] <kwilczynski> Also, there is a very finite number if sources you need to get base :)
[14:46:19] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: yeah i get that. i could hand craft that file. what i want to do is know exactly what the default looks like for a completely basic/vanilla install with default options during install

[14:47:33] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: im not sure Latrina entirely appreciates our sense of humor. i told him/her yesterday that they seem to know some shit, but didnt get the response i expected
[14:47:49] <latr_work> you thinking of me in the midst of such important moment
[14:47:58] <latr_work> I am flattered 
[14:48:05] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I will take time.
[14:48:27] <latr_work> rawtaz: what was the expected response then?
[14:48:29] <rawtaz> latr_work: lol

[14:49:15] <latr_work> nah
[14:49:16] <kwilczynski> I thought toilets would be they/them.
[14:49:59] <latr_work> Latrina is neither a masculine nor a femminin word. At least not in Italian
[14:50:11] <rawtaz> wohoo we have about 10-15 cm snow now :)

[15:39:59] <rawtaz> good luck with that last part :-)

[16:20:36] <rawtaz> (they'd need to not only use windows but also know mac's usage of 365, e.g. outlook on mac as well as the regular calendar and address book on mac - i guess that disqualifies about 99.9% of all them microsoft fanbois who think they know 365)

[18:08:52] <rawtaz> bla bla bla
[18:08:59] <rawtaz> its the way
[18:09:18] <kwilczynski> No.
[18:09:21] <kwilczynski> It's bla bla bla.

[18:10:05] <rawtaz> talk to doge, he's a good councel
[18:10:55] <rawtaz> ok i have to write a script or wahtever that pulls down a list of images, adds a white filling to them to make them 1000x1000 px and then uploads them on some web server and then spits out the corresponding new URLs :o
[18:12:54] <kwilczynski> Ace.
[18:13:08] <kwilczynski> Let's push to production and call it insta2gram.com
[18:13:39] <rawtaz> actually i can just do the upload myself, i just need the fetching, processing and saving, while keeping the same folder structure as the original URLs had
[18:13:42] <rawtaz> sure
[18:13:49] <kwilczynski> No!
[18:13:52] <kwilczynski> Full 100% automation.
[18:13:59] <kwilczynski> It even has to write itself!
[18:14:01] <kwilczynski> No slacking!
[18:14:03] <rawtaz> lol
[18:14:07] <kwilczynski> Get the GitHub thing to do it for you.
[18:14:12] <kwilczynski> My God...
[18:14:18] <kwilczynski> These engineers these days...
[18:14:20] <rawtaz> yeah tehres probalby a github action for that
[18:14:23] * kwilczynski rolls eyes nonchalantly
[18:14:58] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: The action is called "make-it-so"
[18:15:03] <rawtaz> haha
[18:15:04] <kwilczynski> Star Trek inspired.
[18:15:46] <Dus10> I have been working on my Azure DevOps "Project Vending Machine"

[18:16:27] <Dus10> that will be about it
[18:16:37] <Dus10> at least until I move to GitHub Actions
[18:20:04] <rawtaz> i think im gonna write this in bash. could write it in whatever else but meh, bash is perfectly useful for this.
[18:20:20] <kwilczynski> :/
[18:20:32] <kwilczynski> :\
[18:31:34] <shad> rawtaz: are you sure you ain't gonna regret this ?
[18:31:57] <rawtaz> shad: what? :o
[18:32:04] <shad> Here's a simple flowchart
[18:32:15] <rawtaz> writing it in bash? i dont think so. it'll be quicker than writing it in Go
[18:32:46] <shad> "Should I write this in Bash" -> "Does it take more than 3 lines ?" -yes => Not bash -no =>eh... sure about bash ?
[18:33:21] <rawtaz> heh i dont think thats a problem at all :) its less code in e.g. Go
[18:33:27] <rawtaz> potentially more than python but not much
[18:34:04] <latr_work> I find the work's macbook pro 15 just perfect for making rails of coke
[18:34:06] <shad> also, is it a one off thing you run and delete then
[18:34:20] <latr_work> I am glad they gave me a mac
[18:34:35] <rawtaz> regardless its just a matter of reading a file and for each line curl the url, mkdir -p the dirname of it (the URLs arent malicious), run imagemagick, output new url.
[18:34:48] <shad> or is it something that's ending up as produciton toolchain somewhere and a psychopath like me will have to debug it in 5 years ?
[18:34:55] <latr_work> such smooth and straight surface
[18:34:58] <rawtaz> shad: ill keep the script, i have to do this simple processing like four times a year for about 100-200 urls/images
[18:35:13] <rawtaz> nah its just a small automatiion of my manual work so no biggie
[18:35:23] <latr_work> I am on my fourth this morning 
[18:35:28] <shad> yeah...... do it in python
[18:35:29] <rawtaz> latr_work: picture?
[18:35:40] <latr_work> damn, I need to make another one..
[18:35:45] <latr_work> give me 30 minutes
[18:35:45] <rawtaz> shad: then i have a python dependency
[18:35:50] <rawtaz> latr_work: no problem
[18:36:18] <shad> yeah but you can put all that in a Docker image
[18:36:29] <shad> or virtualenv
[18:36:50] <rawtaz> yeh but meh
[18:37:57] <shad> or, you go the stylish way
[18:37:59] <shad> ansible
[18:38:19] <shad> because fuck it ansible is nice, i'm almost sure there's a imagemagick collection
[18:38:53] <rawtaz> haha nice optio
[18:38:53] <rawtaz> n
[18:39:00] <shad> damn, there isn't, shame
[18:39:14] <shad> there's a role that installs it, but wouldn't it be nice to have something like
[18:39:14] <rawtaz> but theres an exec one
[18:39:50] <latr_work> I can't believe I had to tell a DC admin how a linux client should work with a directory domain
[18:40:22] <latr_work> and in general I had to illustrate him that a group must have a GID number to work on unix
[18:40:27] <shad> `community.magick.filling: src: http://foo.bar/baz.jpg color: #00000 size: 1000 dest: http://foo.bar/processed/baz.jpg` 
[18:40:31] <shad> that would have been rad
[18:40:49] <latr_work> perhaps on Windows as well. Dont know that. I am no fucking windows person and I ignore the basics
[18:41:37] <latr_work> so he was surprised to see getent won't fetch an AD group that doesn't have a unique GID number

[19:12:58] <kwilczynski> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/tidoPV1m/
[19:18:07] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: ok? if node->parent isnt the same as child_iter->parent, it makes sense to check it if they want to keep the child's original parent, which i presume they do.
[19:21:26] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: In my head, if you draw the truth table for this assignment, as in when it should be done, it's the same as if when you drop the if-statement. :)
[19:22:59] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: ah you mean because child_iter = node->doc->children above it? indeed. i didnt look there before, i agree completely
[19:23:02] <kwilczynski> Perhaps my old weary eyes mislead me, though.
[19:23:11] <kwilczynski> :)
[19:23:24] <rawtaz> assuming it doesnt like recurse or anything each child should have that parent already
[19:24:18] <latr_work> anyone knows how to set the default Library PATH in R 
[19:24:19] <latr_work> ?

[22:32:04] <lantech19446> ok two ansible questions 1 if ansible is free on all sorts of operating systems why do I need a license for it on rhel and 2 is ansible geared towards linux or can I use it for windoze nodes too?

[22:36:37] <lantech19446> https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible
[22:36:47] <lantech19446> you can try it free for 60 days but then they require a license

[22:37:55] <lantech19446> ooo ok that's the only name i knew it by
[22:38:57] <lantech19446> any thoughts on the other question?
[22:39:20] <rawtaz> you can use it on windows too
[22:39:26] <slaughter> Ansible can manage windows

[22:47:32] <lantech19446> I don't think it loses cool factor just because it's older now, you wrote an entire library for one of the most popular softwares in use today, that to me is quite an accomplishment

[22:49:08] <Dus10> Ansible is most magical when you make Roles and your playbooks are run by the Packer provider to make images, Windows or Linux
[22:50:56] <lantech19446> yea I really want to learn how to do that right now I do things the hard way by building images in WDS but if I could get good enough at yaml to build a playbook that would run after I install the OS and install all the software I need I'd be in heaven
[22:52:47] <lantech19446> I have a class saved on udemy I should be able to watch in one sitting on ansible for beginners so hopefully I'll be more knowledgeable by tonight

[22:56:58] <rawtaz> oh.
[22:57:16] <rawtaz> well if its any comfort i have no idea how to use that
[22:58:35] <lantech19446> it wouldn't take you very long to figure it out, the hardest part is building the image and getting it anonymized correctly
[23:00:46] <rawtaz> i guess the 80/20 rule applies to WDS as well - two hours figuring it out, eight hours at the shrink
[23:01:37] <lantech19446> yea pretty much

[23:08:50] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: That is not how businesses work either. Most won't pay for work to do in-house if someone else already spent the time doing it.
[23:09:11] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Amazon has money, but they didn't create Redis, Kafka, Elasticsearch from scratch just because they can.

[23:09:59] <lantech19446> that leaves them two choices, pay you for it or make their own.

[23:12:02] <lantech19446> you're the first person who's told me that, most people tell me I have to contribute to some projects so employers know that I can code well

[23:22:25] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: When you were talked about learning.
[23:22:43] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Donald Knuth said once that "learning is a skill".
[23:23:08] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: What I mean here by borrowing his quote, is that you need to find a way in which you learn in the most effective way.
[23:23:37] <lantech19446> my biggest problem was untreated bipolar it made it almost impossible to focus on things but i'm much better now and I'm learning everything I can my brain is like a sponge now
[23:23:46] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: And, what might be quite an interesting thing to realise, we often learn the same way we teach (or explain/show) others.
[23:24:21] <rawtaz> i agree. i couldnt stand one of them interview things where they want you to code on a whiteboard
[23:24:47] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: That's OK. Brain is very resilient and malleable.
[23:25:48] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Trust yourself and your brain. :) And think about what I said. It might help you unlock your ability to learn efficiently (does not have to be quickly) and memorise well. Just need to find the way you learn. And everyone learns differently.
[23:25:49] <kwilczynski> :)
[23:26:06] <lantech19446> true

[23:27:49] <rawtaz> not really but i feel it would be good to do so
[23:27:59] <rawtaz> i already learnt the basics, i wrote an application with it the other week
[23:28:04] <kwilczynski> It's very simple language which makes it easy to learn and be productive quickly.
[23:28:28] <rawtaz> Go?
[23:28:39] <rawtaz> i know, ive been using it for years
[23:29:07] <rawtaz> i dislike some parts of it but accept it because theres no other choice lol
[23:29:13] <kwilczynski> Ah.
[23:29:14] <rawtaz> the benefits outweigh the downsides :)
[23:29:22] <kwilczynski> OK.
[23:29:23] <kwilczynski> So.
[23:29:32] <kwilczynski> An idea for a little project for you.

[23:30:14] <kwilczynski> Ansible has dynamic inventories.
[23:30:23] <kwilczynski> One of them is the infamous ec2.py
[23:30:28] <kwilczynski> The problem is... it's dog slow.
[23:30:44] <kwilczynski> When you have a lot of, let's say, compute nodes.
[23:31:32] <kwilczynski> It can take a while to retrieve data, parse it, process it, produce JSON onto the stdout (unless they have better IPC/way of consuming data these days), and so on...
[23:31:52] <kwilczynski> If you wrote this in Go, the ec2.py, then it would be a whole lot... whole loootttt faster.
[23:32:08] <kwilczynski> You can also leverage goroutines to fetch different regions in parallel, etc.
[23:32:57] <kwilczynski> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63071670/why-is-ansibles-ec2-py-dynamic-inventory-script-so-slow
[23:32:59] <kwilczynski> :)
[23:34:01] <kwilczynski> The ec2.py is a bit poorly written, but that's a different story in its own right.
[23:34:50] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: I am suggesting this, as I did something like that to a customer of mine recently.
[23:35:37] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: They had 30-40 seconds delay with ec2.py, and they Ansible not only for provisioning, but also for a lot of utility one-off things to fiddle with things, etc.
[23:36:57] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Go version cut the runtime to 5 seconds, where after initial run reading from cache cut it down to 0.7~1.0 seconds (mainly because writing JSON to stdout for Ansible to consume and parse again into some internal objects is so damn inefficient).
[23:37:21] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Now, if the project was written in a modular way, one can have plugins for AWS, GCP and Azure. :)
[23:37:23] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: Would be nice.
[23:39:13] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: ~3 years ago I wrote a small, albeit naive, grammar parser for Ansible's filter syntax, so this plugin could also support this nicely. https://gist.github.com/kwilczynski/bb0c147bcd6f7669822f2cb94c249bde
[23:42:08] <kwilczynski> Great. Everyone fallen asleep.
[23:42:09] <kwilczynski> :)
[23:42:21] <rawtaz> so
[23:42:51] <rawtaz> im not a fan of dispersing the platform, moving from python when ansible is written in python
[23:43:03] <kwilczynski> You aren't.
[23:43:19] <kwilczynski> Ansible was designed to consume inventory plugins written in whatever.
[23:43:28] <rawtaz> rewriting ec2.py in Go sounds like going from python to Go to me
[23:43:30] <kwilczynski> It so happens that the author of ec2.py wrote it in Python.
[23:43:40] <rawtaz> sure, i get that. but it would be nice if the ecosystem was coherent
[23:43:59] <rawtaz> arent the abslute majority of plugins written in python?
[23:44:52] <kwilczynski> https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.3/dev_guide/developing_modules_general.html#building-a-simple-module
[23:45:01] <kwilczynski> "We are going to use Python here but any language is possible. Only File I/O and outputting to standard out are required. So, bash, C++, clojure, Python, Ruby, whatever you want is fine."
[23:45:18] <kwilczynski> I see you don't quite see wood for a tree.
[23:45:21] <kwilczynski> But that's OK. :)
[23:45:42] <rawtaz> yeah i hear you, im not questioning that it you can write plugins in other langs than python nor that it is perfectly fine to do so
[23:46:01] <rawtaz> so why dont you just release what you already wrote for that client? surely they can contribute it to open source
[23:46:18] <kwilczynski> They won't do it.
[23:46:19] <kwilczynski> :)
[23:46:27] <rawtaz> pfft
