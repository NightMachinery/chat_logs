[14:49:31] <jtgd> Can I connect to weechat relay from circe? If so, can you point me to instructions?
[14:50:20] <wasamasa> if it's like ZNC, I don't see why not
[14:50:26] <wasamasa> make sure to share instructions if you end up doing it
[14:50:58] <jtgd> I don't know if it's like ZNC
[14:53:14] <wasamasa> does it pretend to be an IRC server?
[14:53:23] <wasamasa> can you use an IRC client to connect to it?
[14:53:28] <wasamasa> if not, then nope
[14:55:41] <jtgd> I believe it does, though it has two modes. I'll have to try both
[14:55:58] <jtgd> weechat says "waiting auth"
[14:58:15] <jtgd> yup I'm using the wrong one. "weechat" works only with programs written for it. "irc" acts as proxy so I need to try that
[15:10:31] <jtgd> Is there a way to specify a password other than :nickserv-password ?
[15:23:43] <wasamasa> :pass
[15:23:57] <wasamasa> :sasl-password
[15:43:05] <jtgd> well that's too obvious!  :P thanks
