[05:21:45] <Jigsy> Heh.
[05:21:55] <MootPoot> If you need to nuke C you have bigger problems
[05:22:09] <MootPoot> but yeah, I guess
[05:22:12] <isekaijin> Sure, if I need to nuke C:\, I'm in trouble, but I'd prefer my data not to be in trouble as well.
[05:22:25] <MootPoot> nothing is stopping you from moving your files there
[05:23:06] <isekaijin> I'm impressed that 256 GB is needed. What kind of programs use that much space?
[05:23:19] <MootPoot> new call of duty install is 200gb
[05:23:23] <MootPoot> just on its own
[05:23:41] <isekaijin> Oh, wow.
[05:23:42] <Jigsy> isekaijin: Windows.
[05:23:43] <MootPoot> the core OS files itself are like no more then 20 or something

[05:26:08] <isekaijin> Is Windows 8.1 better than 10 in any important way?
[05:26:12] <ButterNoodle> if dad dresses like a cute anime girl why not
[05:26:17] <ButterNoodle> no isekaijin
[05:26:24] <ButterNoodle> 10
[05:26:25] <MootPoot> no, 8 is the ugly duckling
[05:26:38] <ButterNoodle> 8 is the winme if this era
[05:26:47] <MootPoot> even windows users dont like 8
[05:26:49] <ButterNoodle> it really had no purpose
[05:26:54] <MootPoot> that's how shit it was
[05:27:00] <isekaijin> I see.
[05:27:06] <ButterNoodle> something to buy in between 7 and 10
[05:27:29] <ButterNoodle> like vista was something to buy between xp and 7
[05:27:30] <boogiepop> seemed like it was for tablets, but on PC?
[05:27:40] <ButterNoodle> yea they were trying
[05:27:45] <MootPoot> boogiepop: they tried to half ass a unified UI
[05:27:50] <MootPoot> for desktop and mobile
[05:28:03] <MootPoot> needless to say...touchscreen UI does not work for mouse and KB
[05:28:06] <MootPoot> and vice versa
[05:28:13] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: first hypervisor a success
[05:28:17] <ButterNoodle> now the 2nd one
[05:28:33] <isekaijin> Oh, right, speaking of tablets... Are there any graphics tablets (the ones for drawing) that can be simultaneously used as Android tablets and PC screens?
[05:28:34] <ButterNoodle> I have 400K free on boot :|

[05:28:57] <Sapphirus> Windows is such a fat whore.
[05:28:58] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: 400K is a lotta money
[05:29:12] <ButterNoodle> its not a lot of free disk space
[05:29:12] <Sapphirus> If you have any less diskspace, you won't be doing anything with your system.
[05:29:41] <isekaijin> I went for 100 GB C:\ and 900 GB D:\. I hope it doesn't cause trouble.

[05:33:47] <amigojapan> ohayou boogiepop
[05:35:12] <isekaijin> Okay, so I guess the most important Windows application is a SSH client. Is PuTTY still the best SSH client around for Windows?
[05:35:22] <MootPoot> uh
[05:35:35] <MootPoot> I use mobaXterm..it has a lot of extra stuff
[05:35:43] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, nah, your attitude is still utter garbage.
[05:35:46] <MootPoot> although I'm not sure if you linux crowd would just call that bloat
[05:35:49] <isekaijin> Oh, nice, let's see.
[05:36:02] <amigojapan> i had a weird dream that I got on a taxi but there was also a sarcophagus in the taxi
[05:36:11] <isekaijin> A sarcophagus?
[05:36:15] <isekaijin> In a taxi?
[05:36:19] <boogiepop> i still use putty
[05:36:34] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: dont worry, if it annoys you - I have even more reason to keep it, somebody as fragile as you needs a rude awakening every now and then. 
[05:36:35] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, so I propose a question in response: Are you still going to deflect like the greaseball you are? :P
[05:36:42] <boogiepop> amigojapan: was there anything in the sarcophagus?
[05:37:05] <MootPoot> Oh no, what did I deflect ~
[05:37:11] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, nah, you just have a garbage attitude and completely negate any shit towards how your words are perceived.
[05:37:13] <Sapphirus> That has not changed.
[05:37:28] <Sapphirus> Because you truly lack the ability to care.
[05:37:31] <MootPoot> sure, that's fine.
[05:37:40] <MootPoot> Why would I care about your feelings?
[05:37:50] <Sapphirus> Yes, so let's not deflect that onto me and say I'm fragile as a consequence.
[05:37:57] <Sapphirus> That's a complete deflection -- and that's all it is.
[05:37:59] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I knowit does nto make much sense, but that was my dream
[05:38:11] <MootPoot> Oh no, you are fragile. But you being fragile dosen't mean that I have to care about your fragility.
[05:38:23] <MootPoot> Don't mix the two up.
[05:38:44] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, nah, I'm not fragile. That's just you trying to deflect the irresponsibility for how you conduct yourself onto me for not liking it.
[05:38:46] <isekaijin> I don't see any reason to be so defensive over OS choices... it's just personal preference, really.
[05:38:57] <MootPoot> amigojapan: was it like a cool capsule hotel
[05:38:58] <amigojapan> boogiepop: form the sarcophagus a voice was comming our giving instructions on how ot go somewhere, but that was not my house
[05:38:59] <Sapphirus> In other words, you're the one that's fragile and do **NOT** like that I call you out on your bullshit.
[05:39:17] <amigojapan> MootPoot: no, it was a Florida taxi
[05:39:23] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: You can call me out all day - nobody is stopping you.
[05:39:23] <boogiepop> amigojapan: if you remember the instructions, go there in real life and see what's there 
[05:39:39] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, so I will call out your deflection, as well.
[05:39:53] <boogiepop> MootPoot: im calling ur mom out 
[05:39:54] <Sapphirus> That whole argument I engaged with you in last night was an exercise of this. 
[05:40:20] <Sapphirus> You just don't give a shit and you'd rather blame someone else for it.
[05:40:47] <amigojapan> boogiepop: first of all that was florida, I dont think I will be going to Florida any time soon. and second place it was just saying like turn left here, turn right here in a weird language
[05:40:56] <boogiepop> can't you two just kiss and make up?
[05:40:56] <MootPoot> No, no it wasn't. That whole deal was a exercise in you trying to hide and/or minimize your intentions about insulting me. 
[05:41:23] <isekaijin> amigojapan: IIRC you lived in the US before, right?
[05:41:29] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Did you live in Florida when you lived in the US?
[05:41:34] <MootPoot> >You just don't give a shit and you'd rather blame someone else for it.
[05:41:35] <MootPoot> I dont. And for some reason everyone is fine with that except you...
[05:41:40] <Sapphirus> You fell for my bait. The fact you give more of a shit about that than your own actions speaks immense volumes, MootPoot.
[05:41:53] <amigojapan> yes isekaijin I lived in west palm beach Florida
[05:41:56] <Sapphirus> You even failed at trying to master the bait and throw it back in my face.
[05:41:58] <MootPoot> I never denied it?
[05:42:08] <ButterNoodle> master
[05:42:09] <ButterNoodle> the
[05:42:11] <ButterNoodle> bait
[05:42:13] <MootPoot> lol
[05:42:16] <ButterNoodle> baited
[05:42:16] <Sapphirus> Only reason I ever baited you like that was because your attitude is hot trash.
[05:42:24] <MootPoot> this man is really salty about yesterday
[05:42:33] <boogiepop> fight him
[05:42:39] <MootPoot> I already did
[05:42:44] <Sapphirus> And I wanted to call you out on it, and I did it without directly insulting you. Even if, say you felt insulted, that's more because of the fragility you seem to project onto e.
[05:43:03] <ButterNoodle> u know what this feels like all the time in here
[05:43:09] <MootPoot> >without directly insulting you
[05:43:12] <MootPoot> Are we lying again?
[05:43:18] <MootPoot> Yes, yes we are.
[05:43:20] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, okay, cite where I directly insulted you.
[05:43:32] <ButterNoodle> u remember that one guy that kept breaking his arm jerking himself off about how he was a translator/subber or something
[05:43:34] <Sapphirus> It will be a joke if you try because I never cursed you out, called you a name, nothing.
[05:43:36] <MootPoot> You explicitly stated the insult was directed towards me
[05:43:51] <Sapphirus> It wasn't a direct insult.
[05:44:02] <Sapphirus> Veiled is as far as you can stretch it and I'm not moving back from that.
[05:44:09] <ButterNoodle> of some dog shit worse than venus of war shit
[05:44:27] <ButterNoodle> and kept thinking they had some kinda elite taste
[05:44:28] <Jigsy> I'd insult you lot, but you're not bright enough to notice.
[05:44:28] <Sapphirus> Cite exactly what I said and stare everyone in the face here and say it was an insult.
[05:44:29] * Jigsy hides.
[05:44:33] <ButterNoodle> its like
[05:44:33] <MootPoot> You said it was directed at me, and you said it was veiled...I didn't stretch something - you stated it was.
[05:44:42] <ButterNoodle> hey mudder fucker
[05:44:51] <MootPoot> :3
[05:44:52] <boogiepop> im gonna stretch ur ahole
[05:44:55] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, cite what I said from the logs of yesterday's conversation wherein I allegedly hurled a direct insult at you.
[05:44:58] <ButterNoodle> we are all eating out of the same shit trough here...
[05:45:00] <MootPoot> boogiepop: bole
[05:45:18] <ButterNoodle> and u think the turd ur munchin on is of *high quality
[05:45:31] <Sapphirus> Otherwise you're full of it and you know it. This is a pure semantics game. I'll only admit two things about what I said: It was a veiled insult, and it was intended as bait.
[05:45:57] <ButterNoodle> was it bait and switch?
[05:46:02] <Sapphirus> Look up the dictionary definition of veiled and stop playing games with the goalposts. :P
[05:46:03] <MootPoot> jailbait
[05:46:03] <ButterNoodle> or bait and catch..
[05:46:12] <ButterNoodle> bc neither of those happened
[05:46:25] <Jigsy> Masturbait.
[05:46:31] <ButterNoodle> its just seemed like a mexican hat dance of an argument
[05:46:44] <ButterNoodle> mensturbate
[05:46:50] <ButterNoodle> its bloody fucking hell
[05:46:56] <Jigsy> I've honestly got no idea what's going on.
[05:47:06] <boogiepop> same tbh
[05:47:12] <MootPoot> I mean, its pretty straightforward
[05:48:16] <Sapphirus> ButterNoodle, because MootPoot never intended to have an honest conversation. Let me ask you this: Does "That's because you don't know what you're fucking doing." sound like a direct insult to you?
[05:48:56] <MootPoot> I did say right after I didnt know what I'm doing..
[05:48:57] <Sapphirus> That's almost verbatim what started yesterday's ##anime debate.
[05:48:57] <ButterNoodle> I would take offense.. since its baseless
[05:49:22] <Sapphirus> ButterNoodle, sure, you would be insulted, but is it a direct insult is the question.
[05:49:30] <ButterNoodle> does it matter?
[05:49:31] <Sapphirus> Not did you feel insulted from the implication of what it's saying based on how you see yourself.
[05:49:45] <Sapphirus> Those are two entirely different things and it does matter.
[05:49:57] <ButterNoodle> ig.. someone wants to split hairs
[05:50:14] <ButterNoodle> it was pretty funny
[05:50:43] <ButterNoodle> u insist on insulting someone without insulting someone...
[05:51:05] <ButterNoodle> man up and call em the N word or the R word
[05:51:10] <Sapphirus> lmfao
[05:51:11] <MootPoot> Jigsy, boogiepop I said something about "using linux since it keeps me away from distractions" - then Sapphirus threw a few "veiled insults" right at me...I asked him to clarify and he admitted they were insults...and directed at me. Then it went to him slipping around a while until he admitted he was mad about my "attitude" towards linux and that his insults towards me were justified...then we arrive at today.
[05:51:17] <ButterNoodle> fillin up everyones chat logs with nonsense
[05:51:26] <isekaijin> Calm down, guys... It's just a goddamn OS choice.
[05:51:49] <Jigsy> isekaijin: I don't know, OS choices are pretty SRSFKNBSNZ.
[05:51:56] <Sapphirus> ButterNoodle, in the context of MootPoot, the reason I did it was because of his flippant attitude.
[05:52:03] <Jigsy> Like, if my kid ever told me he used GNOME, I'd disown him right then and there.
[05:52:08] <MootPoot> my "flippant attitude" towards linux
[05:52:16] <Sapphirus> But anyway, it's not like it matters, because MootPoot doesn't give a shit about how anyone perceives him.
[05:52:18] <davic> PH has fucking ants everywhere
[05:52:23] <Sapphirus> I wish I could walk around in life without giving so much of a shit like that.
[05:52:28] <ButterNoodle> it is truly sad that we are resulting to calling people poopie pants instead of litterally shitting on each others waifu's like the gods intended
[05:52:31] <davic> how do I murder ants
[05:52:34] <boogiepop> i prefer MS-DOS
[05:52:39] <Jigsy> PH?
[05:52:48] <isekaijin> Philippines, probably.
[05:52:52] <ButterNoodle> davic: eat them
[05:53:03] <ButterNoodle> they are a good source of protein
[05:53:05] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, nay your flippant attitude in general. 
[05:53:06] <davic> ButterNoodle: its fire ants
[05:53:08] <Sapphirus> This has nothing to do with Linux.
[05:53:09] <Jigsy> Classify the ants as drug addicts and let nature take it's course?
[05:53:09] <davic> dont think its a good idea
[05:53:18] <davic> Jigsy: ah shit, smart
[05:53:21] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: I wonder what makes you think that you are important enough to justify me caring about your take on my attitude
[05:53:30] <ButterNoodle> I mean gasoline
[05:53:38] <boogiepop> davic: pee on them
[05:53:52] <ButterNoodle> but u might as well just pour cash on them till they are smothered
[05:53:54] <davic> boogiepop: they can fucking fly bro
[05:54:02] <boogiepop> those arent ants dude
[05:54:04] <isekaijin> Is there some way to use Windows 10 without creating a Microsoft account?
[05:54:07] <MootPoot> Oh damn, we changed from "flippant attitude towards linux" to "flippant attitude" in general
[05:54:13] <Jigsy> davic: Politely, but firmly, inform the ants that it's a no smoking zone.
[05:54:15] <MootPoot> isekaijin: you can make a local account
[05:54:24] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, I wonder what makes you think that you are free to not give a shit about how others perceive you.
[05:54:33] <Sapphirus> What entitles you to a lack of empathy like that?
[05:54:48] <ButterNoodle> why should anyone give a shit?
[05:54:48] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: what makes me give a shit? Do you pay me? Am I bound by law?
[05:54:49] <isekaijin> I don't see any option to create a local account... maybe this was one of the differences between the Home and Pro editions.
[05:54:54] <ButterNoodle> strange
[05:55:04] <MootPoot> when it asks you to make a MS account there should be an option for "create local"
[05:55:06] <MootPoot> afaik
[05:55:11] <MootPoot> not sure if the home edition is different
[05:55:12] * ButterNoodle is looking to build up his ##anime social credit
[05:55:14] <boogiepop> or "skip for now" or something?
[05:55:16] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, if the only thing stopping you from being a total psychopath is being bound within the constraints of the law, then you truly are something unspeakable.
[05:55:24] <ButterNoodle> *or just press escape
[05:55:52] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: nice move....we went from caring what other people think to actual physical actions
[05:55:52] <boogiepop> alt+f4
[05:55:54] <isekaijin> Apparently, I first have to create a Microsoft account and only then create a local account. Is this right?
[05:56:17] <MootPoot> isekaijin: for me there was just an option to create a non MS account
[05:56:33] <Sapphirus> I hope that you are just being a really bad troll and that's not actually your modus operandi.
[05:56:44] <davic> Pocari Sweat is probably the worst name for a drink
[05:56:48] <Sapphirus> If not, then yikes.
[05:56:52] <davic> so gut tho
[05:56:58] <boogiepop> du bist
[05:57:09] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: I ask again...since when did we go from "caring what people think" to actual physical actions without no consequence?
[05:57:25] <Sapphirus> I wouldn't even trust you with animals if that's your measure if how to operate within the world.

[06:00:30] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, you are maybe like one of two people I've ever encountered on the internet who is sociopathic. You yourself admit how much of a grease ball you're being.
[06:00:34] <boogiepop> that bastard
[06:00:39] <Sapphirus> So I'd suggest you go swim in your own grease and leave me the fuck out of it.
[06:00:45] <ButterNoodle> he broke manjaro and shits on arch linux because of it
[06:00:54] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: I agree, if you can't handle my grease just leave IRC
[06:00:57] <MootPoot> :3
[06:01:34] <Sapphirus> I guess you aren't that smart to be outing yourself as one without even realising the implications of what you are even saying.
[06:01:45] <Sapphirus> Either that, or you're trolling. I don't even know if that matters.
[06:01:58] <Sapphirus> You could be just trolling me but I don't think that makes it any better.
[06:02:04] <ButterNoodle> lol not the first time someone has been accused of being a sociopath in here
[06:02:04] <MootPoot> amigojapan is the sole reason for windows requiring microsoft accounts
[06:02:37] <boogiepop> youre seriously a butthole amigojapan
[06:02:52] <MootPoot> He once threw a 7/11 chicken sandwich at the microsoft office in tokyo with GNU/Linux written on it with a marker
[06:02:57] <MootPoot> A PERMANENT MARKER
[06:03:15] <boogiepop> written on the actual chicken patty, or just the wrapper?
[06:03:22] <amigojapan> What
[06:03:26] <MootPoot> ON THE BREAD
[06:04:34] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they want to be able to track bad licenses
[06:05:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: what do you blame me for?
[06:06:00] <MootPoot> amigojapan: Microsoft requires Microsoft accounts on windows 10 home because you threw a 7/11 sandwich at the Microsoft Tokyo office
[06:06:16] <MootPoot> with GNU/Linux written on it
[06:06:26] <davic> amigojapan: ban warning
[06:06:31] <amigojapan> Lol
[06:06:52] <MootPoot> it was a egg sandwich too
[06:06:59] <MootPoot> the best 7/11 sandwich

[06:12:54] <MootPoot> I thought overseas 7/11s were just 7/11s
[06:12:59] <davic> nah
[06:13:04] <amigojapan> MootPoot: in 7/11 sandwitches are particularly over priced, but they sell the ingredients for manking many sandwitches seperately much chepaer
[06:13:06] <davic> the original 711s are in US and JP
[06:13:08] <davic> pretty much
[06:13:28] <MootPoot> US ones are shite
[06:13:55] <MootPoot> I would kill for a SE Asia conveience store here in NA
[06:13:59] <MootPoot> amigojapan: how much more
[06:14:16] <ButterNoodle> yea
[06:14:33] <ButterNoodle> cause no excellent adventure ever started at a dairy mart
[06:15:02] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: MFW there will never be a cute japanese girl to talk to at the nearby kombini
[06:15:07] <amigojapan> MootPoot: so they want like over 3 USB for a sandwitch, but you could buy 6 pices of bread and an egg salad for a little more
[06:15:08] <MootPoot> no kombini sex
[06:16:38] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: we gotta warn bill and ted not to start an adventure at dairy mart
[06:17:15] <MootPoot> amigojapan: that's not too bad I guess
[06:17:32] <MootPoot> 7/11 sandwich here is like 6-7 dollars
[06:17:39] <MootPoot> for a crappy sandwich which is 3 days old
[06:17:42] <amigojapan> ouch MootPoot
[06:18:04] <Sapphirus> Better off making your own sandwich with sandhiwch meat.
[06:18:08] <Sapphirus> Even Subway isn't filling
[06:18:10] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: just watch jk to ero kombini
[06:18:10] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but I rather pay 4 dollars for like 3 sandwiches, no?
[06:18:11] <ButterNoodle> ez
[06:18:53] <MootPoot> amigojapan: most of the problems have to do with cars
[06:18:53] <Sapphirus> Sure there's no convenience in procuring your own bread, cutting it, slapping meat onto it; but at least it won't suck.
[06:19:06] <MootPoot> its hard to have a constant fresh food supply in a car centric culture
[06:19:11] <MootPoot> in a kombini
[06:19:49] <MootPoot> since people can just quickly pop into a store on the way to work but parking and going to get breakfast ( shit breakfast ) from a gas station here is like 10-15 min
[06:20:03] <MootPoot> vs ~1 min in a walking area
[06:20:05] <mixfix41> get artisian bread they use whole packages ingredients stay fresh
[06:20:31] <amigojapan> MootPoot: so I never buy sandwiches anymore, onigiri as still a simillar size and only cost 1 dollar
[06:20:33] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, I wouldn't blame our car culture for it onto itself, so much as I'd say it's a downstream consequence of poor urban planning. You inevitably end up having to drive to everywhere because of car-centric planning.
[06:20:56] <Sapphirus> That's going to change as gasoline prices if they stay as high as they are.
[06:21:06] <Sapphirus> Some of the real snobs that prevent shared zoning are going to have to get a dose of reality.
[06:21:20] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: in Japan things are build around train stations
[06:21:36] <ButterNoodle> whats a train station
[06:21:48] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: where you meet cute JKs after sundown
[06:21:48] <Sapphirus> ^^ exactly
[06:21:53] <Sapphirus> what butternoodle said

[06:21:54] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: train was last seen in #anime 7 years and 10 months ago: * train is now known as Guest17604

[06:22:21] <ButterNoodle> *possibly
[06:22:24] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: 7 years ago tho
[06:22:36] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, it's going to take us awhile to flip that switch to being more public-transit oriented.

[06:22:56] <Sapphirus> Transition has been beginning to occur but it's been very slow.
[06:23:04] <ButterNoodle> Sapphirus: cant happen in 90% of america
[06:23:12] <MootPoot> needs more hormones
[06:23:20] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: as long as the cities can do it
[06:23:30] <Sapphirus> ButterNoodle, solution is rather simple: Get rid of suburbia and have shared zoning.
[06:23:32] <MootPoot> bumfuck nowhere can keep doing unsupervised incest
[06:23:49] <MootPoot> the cities can have human cattle 
[06:23:56] <Sapphirus> An incestuous relationship with business and residence is what is needed. That's how rural Japan works.
[06:24:23] <ButterNoodle> yea.. no one is gonna vote for anyone thats gonna take tax dollars and invest in mass transit in a place like rock springs wyoming
[06:24:26] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: if you only build next to trains stations why cant it happen in america?
[06:24:34] <Sapphirus> ButterNoodle, first it starts with shared zoning.
[06:24:37] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: america is already built
[06:24:40] <Sapphirus> Train stations come after.
[06:24:48] <amigojapan> alright ButterNoodle
[06:24:49] <Sapphirus> THat doesn't mean it can't be remodelled. 
[06:24:56] <ButterNoodle> ahh the old cart first method
[06:25:13] <ButterNoodle> I mean
[06:25:25] <ButterNoodle> if u make it more expensive to drive to work.. than to go to work..
[06:25:37] <ButterNoodle> you will force suburbia into foreclosure
[06:25:40] <ButterNoodle> ez fix
[06:25:43] <isekaijin> Why on Earth does the Windows setup not allow me to use my physical keyboard? I ahve to type using the on-screen keyboard.
[06:26:03] <Sapphirus> Then rezone the shit out of suburbia and then you can walk to work, your doctor's office, etc
[06:26:10] <ButterNoodle> isekaijin: what on earth are u actually doing? installing windows 10 in a virtual machine on ur ipad mini?
[06:26:13] <MootPoot> afaik suburbia needs to be taxed heavier - I read just recently that it needs to pay 9x more in tax to cover the cost it takes to service them
[06:26:22] <MootPoot> isekaijin: ????????????? that sounds like a bug or something
[06:26:25] <Sapphirus> Japan was right by using shared zoning.

[07:38:18] <mixfix41> well i dont see why you want to do it wireless besides to figure the wireless side out. just use the cups it handles both
[07:38:34] <MootPoot> yeah he dosen't want to use cups

[07:39:26] <mixfix41> you could try using netcat but ive had to
[07:39:28] <mixfix41> never had to
[07:39:50] <mixfix41> cups is just as good on the commandline so theres no point not using it
[07:40:10] <mixfix41> theres no way around using cups simply put. even if you use direct connection

[07:55:56] <mixfix41> im total noob when it comes to router software i know this fact tho
[07:56:26] <jessedesu_onaph> My roommate has some kind of Asus router
[07:56:35] <isekaijin> The file explorer is fine. Windows XP's was better, but this one isn't that bad.
[07:56:40] <jessedesu_onaph> And probably like a dozen devices on it
[07:56:57] <jessedesu_onaph> I can block anyone's device

[07:57:07] <mixfix41> honestly it was good when arp-scan was working except the kernel had change so arp-scan no longer work well so it does rely on how the kernel and your network software applications you choose works with your setup
[07:57:14] <mixfix41> so there may not be one correct way
[07:57:21] <mixfix41> arp-scan with asus was really fast

[07:57:48] <mixfix41> but since i couldnt use it on newer kernels, (old machines eventually i stop using) nmap was a better tool and asus was slow

[07:57:59] <mixfix41> but now i got mikrotek :)

[08:01:45] <mixfix41> i had a nighthawk
[08:02:07] <mixfix41> if you want to experiment with them with AP. but i just with with a more community driven option 
[08:02:09] <MootPoot> Right now almost my entire network is Tp Link

[08:03:07] <mixfix41> so i did do that research for my home use

[09:59:22] <jessedesu_onaph> Wat
[10:00:11] <MootPoot> for some reason something went wrong

[10:00:52] <MootPoot> There we go
[10:00:53] <MootPoot> that works
[10:00:56] <MootPoot> now last problem
[10:01:07] <MootPoot> isekaijin: do you have any experience with plasma 5?
[10:01:18] <jessedesu_onaph> How do I get the blank Screensaver to turn off the back light as well
[10:01:27] <jessedesu_onaph> On lubuntu
[10:01:40] <MootPoot> all I want is for the icons on the default menu bar to have text labels
[10:01:51] <MootPoot> for some reason this is unheard of in the linux world
[10:02:04] <mexen> jessedesu_onaph: I quit last year but I still dream about smoking every now and then
[10:02:11] <MootPoot> I tried using tint2 which has that...but it dosen't work with KDE very well
[10:02:31] <MootPoot> Do I actually have to deal with this disgusting macOS launcher like bar
[10:06:18] <isekaijin> MootPoot: My experience with Plasma is limited to 30 minutes of trying to use it.
[10:06:31] <MootPoot> eh, well
[10:06:43] <MootPoot> weird thing about linux
[10:06:48] <isekaijin> It does too many magical things.
[10:06:50] <MootPoot> they seem very...binary in design 
[10:07:04] <MootPoot> either its console and shotgun all the info into your face
[10:07:04] <isekaijin> It creates files and directories in unexpected places, using a naming convention that doesn't match mine.
[10:07:22] <MootPoot> OR....who can make the most macOS like UI
[10:08:46] <MootPoot> isekaijin: all I want is my launcher to have text labels
[10:08:52] <MootPoot> rather then only icons
[10:09:12] <MootPoot> for some reason this is strange and unheard of and nobody could possibly want this
[10:10:17] <MootPoot> so instead what they all do is make the most tablet or macOS like UI thing, which results in like 2 extra clicks every time I want to access a different window of the same application ( click on icon -> read the popup for all the windows of that application -> click on what window I want )

[10:34:33] <isekaijin> amigojapan: BlueStacks doesn't run on Linux. (And, according to WineHQ's database, Wine's support for BlueStacks is “garbage”.)
[10:34:34] <MootPoot> although it just takes like 2 toggles to turn it off
[10:34:35] <Sapphirus> Unironically? more like people are idiots and Windows is further being catered to dullards.

[10:36:34] <jessedesu2> Hwoa maigojapan is ebing rtendy
[10:36:39] <Sapphirus> Perhaps not. Driver's ed fails as a basic common sense test.
[10:37:04] <Sapphirus> Also fails at "Can I use reason?" 
[10:37:18] <Sapphirus> Probably not, and hence why you can't trobuleshoot and figure out how to replace a spark plug.
[10:38:15] <amigojapan> isekaijin: it is kind of like voting for favorite OS, every time you install an app for it
[10:38:19] <jessedesu2> I ride a very dangerous machine called a motorcycle
[10:38:36] <Sapphirus> Those are death machines.
[10:38:38] <jessedesu2> I don't check everything before I go out on it
[10:38:47] <Sapphirus> And usually only for the rider, not anyone else.
[10:39:00] <jessedesu2> I just ride slowly and check things as I go before going faster
[10:39:14] <jessedesu2> That is my survival strategy
[10:39:42] <Sapphirus> You can at least get away with it in the People's Republic of California.
[10:39:52] <amigojapan> changing  a sparkplug is easy
[10:39:55] <isekaijin> amigojapan: By that token, I'm still massively voting for GNU/Linux. Whenever a program runs both on Windows and GNU/Linux, I use the latter.
[10:40:15] <amigojapan> alright isekaijin
[10:40:33] <jessedesu2> Amigojapan, not when there's a gastank and airbox above it

[12:18:19] <BillyZane> jessedesu2, to my knowledge, it's been used in 3 wars: against turkish separatists, against armenia in the conflict between armenia and azerbaijan, and it's been used in libya, and from what i understand, this drone was able to turn the tide of battle in an instant
[12:18:47] <jessedesu2> What can it carry
[12:19:07] <BillyZane> technical details could be found here, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baykar_Bayraktar_TB2
[12:19:07] <ImoutoBot> [title] Baykar Bayraktar TB2 - Wikipedia
[12:19:35] <BillyZane> but the important point is, it's completely changing the way wars are fought, because it can do what an F-16 can do, but at some ridiculously low price, something like 1/50th the cost
[12:19:56] <BillyZane> these drones don't move fast, like 130mph, and have a pretty short range
[12:20:08] <MootPoot> time for skynet BillyZane 
[12:20:09] <BillyZane> but the slow movement actually makes them invisible on radar
[12:20:19] <BillyZane> because the radar software ignores anything moving so slow
[12:20:39] <BillyZane> i guess that could be fixed, but there was a window where the drones were just wreaking havo
[12:20:47] <MootPoot> once they get fully auto drones in then that'll be even worse - cant even jam em

[12:27:19] <BillyZane> guns do not have a fixed advantage over swords. at close enough distances, a sword could be more advantageous. it's the distance that determines which is superior for combat. the same goes with drones and guns. a gun could certainly kill a drone operator, but at large enough distances, thousands of miles even, the drone would clearly win

[18:07:48] <Bco1981> yes
[18:08:18] <isekaijin> Oh, right. Old versions of windows changed the cursor to a different icon when you hovered over the edge of a window.
[18:08:29] <isekaijin> The new icon basically told you that you could resize the window.
[18:08:47] <Bco1981> since when was that new ?
[18:08:57] * Bco1981 fires up xp
[18:09:17] <isekaijin> I'm not saying it's a new feature, I'm saying “new icon”, because it's a different icon from the usual arrow.
[18:09:44] <isekaijin> Anyhow, Window is rather frustrating to use with a drawing tablet instead of a mouse.
[18:09:52] <Bco1981> true, xp has a black arrow
[18:10:02] <isekaijin> Unlike Linux, which can be used just fine with a drawing tablet.
[18:10:08] <MootPoot> The only thing I use pens with on windows is drawing penises

[18:12:06] <MootPoot> Bbc
[18:12:07] <isekaijin> Bco1981: The issue isn't the color. The cursor is ordinarily an arrow. When you hover over the edge of a window, the cursor changes to something like this: https://dondi.github.io/paradixm/components/resizing/arrow-horizontal.jpg

[18:20:27] <MootPoot> Need more weeb games on Xbox 
[18:20:42] <Bco1981> not enough eroge
[18:20:50] <MootPoot> Also, not much reason to get an Xbox anyway 
[18:20:56] <MootPoot> Since PC
[18:21:22] <Bco1981> and gamepass now. even less need for one.
[18:21:32] <Bco1981> but... that was probably why M$ did that.
[18:21:47] <Bco1981> have heard a few vtubers talk about it.
[18:22:03] <isekaijin> Okay, so, if you have a maximized window and drag its title bar, what happens?
[18:22:09] <isekaijin> On Windows XP, the right thing: nothing.

[18:24:48] <ButterNoodle> I like to pull at it
[18:25:11] <isekaijin> Bco1981: By accident? Misclicks happen.
[18:25:40] <isekaijin> The fact that the title bar is invisible doesn't help.
[18:25:49] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: i need those non encrypted scripts again. i didn't get them off of the debian install before i wiped it.
[18:25:51] <MootPoot> isekaijin: how is your bar invisible
[18:25:54] <Bco1981> please :)
[18:26:00] <ButterNoodle> yep
[18:26:02] <MootPoot> you haven't really answered my earlier question
[18:26:27] <MootPoot> are you sure "invisible" is not just windows aero with that semi transparent title bar

[18:29:46] <isekaijin> MootPoot: Yeah.
[18:30:16] <isekaijin> It's not a different color, so it's difficult to tell if I'm clicking on the title bar or not.
[18:30:25] <MootPoot> yeah, if that is transparent then its some fuckery with your theming going on

[23:27:52] <Nanobot> YouTube, dude, it's been over a week now. Could you please stop showing me the "We're Building Computers Wrong / There's a better way" Veritasium video *that I've already watched* in the sidebar of EVERY SINGLE VIDEO ON YOUTUBE?
[23:30:01] <Nanobot> I wish they would just bring back related videos. Why is it so trendy for every social media/search site to intentionally shove irrelevant stuff I don't care about into places where relevant links are supposed to go?
[23:30:30] <Nanobot> "Other people searched for..." I don't care. I never care.

[23:54:08] <DPA> I wish all tea was governed by anime physics. Two small blows, and it's always the perfect temperature.
[23:55:37] <isekaijin> Poeticode: I need to run two specific programs: Zoom (it has a Linux client, but it's shit, and it's even more shit if you use a tiling window manager) and BlueStacks.
[23:56:59] <isekaijin> Windows is still incredibly slow.
[23:58:01] <isekaijin> Also, configuration with a GUI still sucks ass compared to configuration with text files.
[23:58:44] <Bco1981> what are you running it on?... hdd is not okay. just so you know.
[23:58:52] <Bco1981> windows 10 needs ssd
[23:59:28] <DPA> I don't use zoom myself, but I think it also can be used using the browser alone.
