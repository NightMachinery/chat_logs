[07:50:24] <KillerWasp> Rather the opposite, it is already well seen that open source does not generate any profit.

[07:52:28] <blahboybaz> hey, I'll have two files. A "main.js" and a "linked-list.js". Well I kind want to hide all the functionality and stuff inside linked-list.js and just call functions from it in main.js. So when it comes to output I have 2 options (that I can see). Either I print output from main.js or from withing the functions in linked-list.js. If I print directly from the functions in linked-list.js I don't 
[07:52:34] <blahboybaz> know if that's just a stupid or worng thing to do. If I pring from main.js I'll probably have to make my functions in linked-list.js return more stuff that I want to pring out.

[12:07:37] <recursiveNode> In Java, what's the highest performing code if your aim is to transport 1,000,000 Strings from a client app to the server app? Assuming they are on the same subnet, and they are both simple socket apps (i.e. the server app is really a socket listening on some port, accepting a connection, and then reading any input)
[12:07:49] <mrig> password4: I dont hate it, it is just pathetic, reflects an apathy of culture.
[12:08:03] <mrig> a generalised apathy.

[17:11:21] <mrig> pulse: there is also in open source projects that work well, I think.
[17:11:30] <pulse> but if you work at google you don't question your lead
[17:11:40] <mrig> Just that the intentions of the project leader are not to make money.
[17:11:50] <Quietwalker> pulse: That's my experience in the business world, more than the FOSS world.  In the FOSS world, for smallish projects (I haven't worked on anything too large), you get one personality at the top, and the rest are just contributors.
[17:12:04] <pulse> i've seen some horrible shit in FOSS communities, it's hard to imagine people can be that vile tbh
[17:12:16] <Quietwalker> I dunno, I've been on IRC for decades
[17:12:26] <Quietwalker> it always shakes down like that
[17:12:31] <mrig> Quietwalker: Thank you for confirming that, I was thinking that this is most likely the case.

[17:13:24] <PlanckWalk> I've seen a few FOSS projects self-destruct, and a few businesses.
[17:13:31] <pulse> i've been in some and typically there's a power struggle, people leave, drama all around, 5 years later the project barely moves forward
[17:13:37] <Quietwalker> the last few years what I've seen, for example, is a rise of docker, kubernetes.  That's fine right?  Except that the IT crowd is pushing system management on the devs.

[17:15:04] <password2> new teams can be hired
[17:15:17] <Quietwalker> so IT will unilaterally decide everything's going to docker and kubnernetes, set up the systems, and then demand software engineers take over and start writing terraform configurations and so on - though they're not allowed to have access to the systems, they're just supposed to write pristine config files without the ability to easily test.
[17:15:19] <rindolf> pulse: you keep arguing that non-foss is better than foss. it has been getting tiresome
[17:15:20] <Quietwalker> things like that.
[17:15:44] <mrig> rindolf: he is entitled to his opinion though.
[17:15:50] <pulse> rindolf, you keep arguing the opposite, and you're objectively wrong
[17:15:54] <Quietwalker> at IBM, I worked on a next-gen infocenter project.  You know the help module you see in every IBM product?  In eclipse IDE?
[17:15:58] <mrig> both have their up and their down sides.
[17:16:04] <Quietwalker> we had something like 17 managers and 2 devs

[17:16:49] <PlanckWalk> Yes, most FOSS creative tools suck.

[17:16:59] <mrig> yes thats the eat your own food thing.
[17:17:03] <pulse> i released at least 4 projects under MIT just last year
[17:17:08] <PlanckWalk> Blender is about the only one that comes to mind as being even comparable.

[17:17:17] <pulse> PlanckWalk, yes, Blender is amazing
[17:17:19] <Quietwalker> everyone in the Poughkeepsie offices just spent time sending everyone else kudos messages rather than doing anything and the austin offices couldn't get any traction to get anything done.
[17:17:27] <Quietwalker> anyway ...
[17:17:34] <rindolf> pulse: s/objectively/IMO/ ;)
[17:17:38] <mrig> Is Krita FOSS too?
[17:17:44] <mrig> it is superb.
[17:17:55] <rindolf> mrig: it is
[17:18:00] <mrig> better that adobe I'd say
[17:18:07] <mrig> darkroom is also fantastic.
[17:18:22] <pulse> rindolf, photoshop is objectively better than gimp
[17:18:28] <Quietwalker> I think that FOSS is just a more public version of how companies exist; both are constructs of people, both have a lot of the same tools and while motivations might differ (make money vs. make a popular/useful) ... it's generally the same.
[17:18:39] <mrig> inkscape and gimp are both a little dated now, but it is normal as they are older projects.
[17:18:42] <Quietwalker> The same things happen in both cases.
[17:18:54] <pulse> adobe premiere is objectively way, way, way better than anything in the FOSS world

[17:19:49] <pulse> mrig, Krita is pretty good, all things considered
[17:20:00] <PlanckWalk> As much as I hate Adobe as a company, and much of their software is infuriating, it seems to work better than anything else for its purpose.

[17:21:24] <mrig> gimp is a little contorted at times in its approach to certain things; I gather that its GUI lib was developed along with it.
[17:21:33] <mrig> so that would be pretty normal I should think.
[17:21:35] <password2> gimp is yuck
[17:21:37] <Quietwalker> $300 for a cheap community college course saves you several grand a year in adobe costs.

[18:14:59] <Joanna> Borland pascal was very primitive compared to modern pascal. It was good for beginners though
[18:15:13] <novns> p0g0, new languages became popular, and easier than Pascal for usual tasks
[18:15:23] <pulse> anyone sane today would use .NET or the like
[18:15:28] <p0g0> Jensen and Partners released one of the first compilers that managed front end parsers, so their Modula-2 front end had the same compiler as their C. But J&P never made much of a splash

[18:43:13] <nitrix> mrig, I think a simple design would be to load the entire file in a buffer that lets you seek/peek/whatever, then give alternate control to the two lexers to work on the buffer.

[18:44:52] <nitrix> mrig, And then you obviously can add logic for either lexers to produce errors, to short-circuit the other lexer, etc.
[18:45:06] <archie> pulse I am pretty sure there's no optimization by default
[18:45:18] <pulse> archie, surely there's flags in the cmake file?
[18:45:36] <mrig> nitrix: oh I see, two running side by side, yes of course if tokens turn up for one, they can just cede to the other.
[18:46:00] <nitrix> mrig, I would personally have a single lexer though. Seems like there's a problem with the language grammar if it has to distinguish between things so early in the translation phases.
[18:46:09] <mrig> nitrix: right yes I see what you mean, better that than mixing up the functionality into one parser.
[18:46:14] <Joanna> I think it helps if people monitor what is happening I. Their communities and not give easy access to strangers

[19:39:09] <soulisson> GeDaMo, oh. So there is a font for the space character?
[19:39:13] <deniska> soulisson: which can be displaying something, or moving a cursor around, or even putting it in special modes
[19:39:44] <deniska> soulisson: yeah, there're even fonts which display space in some way, which can be useful for debugging purposes
[19:39:49] *** Joins: Auron (~Auron956@user/auron)
[19:40:04] <GeDaMo> A bitmap font would normally be an array, so each character would be looked by by array indexing
[19:40:44] <deniska> and space will just be all pixels off
[19:41:03] <nitrix> soulisson, The representation in a font for a character is named a glyph. What the character is and what glyph it results into visually are two separate things. Unicode for example lets you combine characters together, for example √© is the acute accent + the letter e, which then may or may not have its own glyph depending if your font bothered with it.
[19:41:23] <mrig> GeDaMo: it is the code and solution to a problem in 'The go programming language' book : https://github.com/8i8/tgpl/tree/master/ex_07.13-bis-Expr_surface/eval

[19:43:12] <mrig> GeDaMo: I'm just starting to grok the difference between runtime and compile time when you run code, which kinda shifts the way that you think about what is going on and when; For reusability and things like that.
[19:44:09] <deniska> soulisson: modern font systems are pretty much programming languages on their own
[19:44:45] <deniska> soulisson: so space in something like ttf font can be implemented as "move that amount of units in the current direction of text"
[19:44:55] <DPA> There was a font which is a pokemon game somewhere
[19:45:21] <Soni> is stuff like this okay? `#define LCP_CB_IMPL_OPT(name) LCP_CB_IMPL(name, )`  `#define LCP_CB_IMPL_REQ(name) LCP_CB_IMPL(name, assert(func != NULL);)`

[22:48:45] <Izem> So after trying to design a new syntax, this is what I figured out. For computers it needs to be context free, for implementation it should be transferable to a tree structure easily. A small grammar with a few rules is more important, especially as you can accommodate further needs with macros and sugar.

[22:59:02] <Izem> did smalltalk die off because of java?
[22:59:55] <GeDaMo> There were a number of reasons but Java and C++ probably didn't help

[23:25:10] <terminalpusher> hmm it seems you haven't configured your vim?
[23:25:15] <GeDaMo> I suspect it's used to override the system defaults
[23:25:48] <mercenary> It is indeed
[23:25:51] <vdamewood> terminalpusher: I haven't had a configuration I felt needed changes.
[23:26:03] <terminalpusher> it's a good thing if the defaults work out

[23:28:31] <pulse> vim defaults aren't good at all
[23:29:51] <pulse> at the very least you want smartindent, tabstop=4 instead of 8 and you probably want line numbers
[23:30:05] <GeDaMo> I don't like smartindent :|

[23:30:54] <vdamewood> I don't like line numbers.
[23:30:56] <IanWizard> I'm trying to think through an efficient way to split a triangle (defined by three points), into two right triangles.  More specifically, I'm trying to find the point on one side of the triangle where a line from the opposite point would be perpendicular to that side of the triangle.  While this isn't related to the GPU stuff I've been doing
[23:30:56] <IanWizard> recently, my thinking may be influenced by it.  I know that if the hypotenuse lies on the X axis, then the simple solution is to take the point opposite the hypotenuse, and then the intersection would be wherever Y=0.  This is reasonably simple for a human, or to do with a matrix transform, but I'm thinking there should be an easier way?
[23:31:02] <pulse> and for gvim i would punch the wall repeatedly without set vb t_vb=
[23:31:11] <pulse> really who set those annoying beeps as defaults
[23:31:19] <IanWizard> This is largely a though experiment ATM, so wild ideas are quite welcome :)

[23:33:21] <GeDaMo> Does the cross product not help with this?
[23:33:37] <vdamewood> IanWizard: Pick a line. Assign it an angular value based on it's angular position relative to the x axis. Take that value and find an angle perpendicular to that line. From the opposing point, draw a line in the direction of your original line.

[23:59:04] <Guest9> is there anything like best practices/checklist for programming in general/any project? or for python language? I find pragmatic programmer nicebook.
