[00:00:28] <joepie91> are they still recycling the old camcorder shit?
[00:01:17] <ThePendulum> yeah, they did threw in some new ones because people started wearing masks in some of them
[00:01:40] <ThePendulum> I don't know how much re-editing SBS does
[00:01:48] <ThePendulum> in terms of the video sequence
[00:02:01] <ThePendulum> I'm quite (pleasantly) surprised they have an actual host to this day
[00:04:47] <ThePendulum> I would think they could get away just playing the videos but they're paying for her, the studio, the crew, the writers
[00:05:07] <ThePendulum> at the end of the day the cheapest program is the only one that hasn't gone completely gone to shit, lol
[00:06:07] <ThePendulum> -gone
[00:06:16] <joepie91> honestly that can't have taken more than an afternoon in a studio
[00:06:54] <ThePendulum> true, probably a whole season in one session, still appreciate they stuck with the effort
[00:07:54] <ThePendulum> although they do have schedule-aware sign offs at the end, so either they have very rigid planning or they don't shoot them all that far ahead
[00:07:58] <joepie91> ThePendulum: I'm reminded of when I went to Weekend Miljonairs as studio audience once
[00:08:07] <ThePendulum> :O
[00:08:13] <ThePendulum> what was that like?
[00:08:16] <joepie91> they did like half the season in one day
[00:08:24] <joepie91> and every audience person was there for 2 or 3 episodes
[00:08:32] <joepie91> and everybody shuffled around to different seats between the episodes
[00:08:36] <joepie91> to make it not look like the same audience lmao
[00:08:38] <ThePendulum> I was gonna ask
[00:08:40] <ThePendulum> haha
[00:08:52] <ThePendulum> some goof should put on a bright orange tracksuit or something
[00:09:19] <joepie91> this was maaaaaany years ago, like 15 or so, so my memories of it are... scattered
[00:09:28] <joepie91> I recall the studio seeming so much smaller in person
[00:09:36] <ThePendulum> yeah that is often the case
[00:09:40] <joepie91> like, it wasn't really that big?
[00:10:21] <ThePendulum> set designers really know what they're doing
[00:10:57] <ThePendulum> and the, eh, not sure they're called cinematographers in TV, not really the director or the camera operator either
[00:11:03] <ThePendulum> viewframe designer, whatever
[00:14:13] <ThePendulum> anyway there are two videos with a very similar premise
[00:14:30] <ThePendulum> in one this redneck throws a horseshoe in the air, it lands on his helmet, he doesn't notice the helmet flies off
[00:14:52] <ThePendulum> he throws the horseshoe again, lets it land on his head again...
[00:15:23] <ThePendulum> looks at the camera asking in the most southern accent "I wasn't wearing my helmet?"
[00:16:35] *** Quits: stonkey (~stonkey@user/stonkey) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[00:17:10] <ThePendulum> second one is a guy, looks like Brian May. put up a mattress against a wall, runs into the mattress and walks back while the mattress falls onto the ground, guy doesn't notice, runs at the wall while looking at the camera, trips over the mattress and smashes into the wall
[00:17:17] <ThePendulum> that guy reminds me of a friend of my dad's lol

[03:31:19] <rawktucc> Hydragyrum, that is true. thing is, I'm IN THEORY leaving in 5 months, so I won't really even need the gbit at home... and nobody else in the house will benefit from it
[03:31:32] <Hydragyrum> that's a good point
[03:31:35] <rawktucc> they need like 100/50 at home, but realistically they will probably downgrade to 100/200 or 500/20 at some point
[03:31:45] <rawktucc> or 75/10, something like that. at least the modem and router aren't shit nhow
[03:32:18] <rawktucc> leaving as in travelling sorry. my intent is to move a bunch of data to a (when formatted as zraid1) 44-46TB server I've rented, with colder stored data in scaleway c14
[03:32:32] *** Parts: ee2455 (~ee2455@user/ee2455) (Leaving)
[03:32:43] <rawktucc> so if I just do a couple trips with a few HDDs to my friends house, without pissing off them or their ISP, ezclap and the bulk load is done. everything else well.. idk
[03:32:57] <rawktucc> problem is I Have technically 100TB, maybe not of things I want to keep but im really not sure
[03:33:25] <rawktucc> i have to preplan exactly what'll get transferred, and then I think use rclone crypt to just copy it pre-encrypted to the external, and not use encryption on the drive either to reduce CPU Overhead on a pi4
[03:33:35] <rawktucc> then just do an rclone copy to the remote system
[03:39:40] <evilgohan2> rawktucc / NeoThermic: could do both. IJS.
[03:39:52] <evilgohan2> get gigabit AND take an HDD over
[03:39:59] <rawktucc> could. its expensive though for Bell and bell is annoying
[03:40:12] <evilgohan2> also, what is it like having thots in your head? :P

[03:40:49] <rawktucc> it's like $135+tax and right now we pay $120 or something for cable gbit/30mbit (which I can't even use the gbit fully because of OpenWRT), plus I wonder if Bell would get pissed at large data movement
[03:40:52] <rawktucc> evilgohan2, :|
[03:41:46] <evilgohan2> oh, if already getting gbit down, if you don't necessarily _need_ the gigabit up then have at it
[03:41:55] <evilgohan2> Though, tbh, I'm of the opinion that:
[03:41:57] <evilgohan2> 1. caps are crap
[03:42:05] <evilgohan2> 2. don't sell "unlimited" if it ain't unlimited.
[03:42:20] <rawktucc> no evilgohan2 I want gigabit up, but If I had it I'd honestly only need it for maybe a month or two
[03:42:24] <rawktucc> less even
[03:42:27] <rawktucc> I could move 100TB easily
[03:42:33] <evilgohan2> eh, you'd be amazed the uses you can find for things
[03:42:40] <evilgohan2> also, openwrt should have an option for cut through routing
[03:42:48] <rawktucc> it's unlimited from Bell, but it's Bell so "unlmimited" may actually mean "actually you are now blocked because you did 10TB this month :)"
[03:42:53] <rawktucc> cut through routing?
[03:43:05] <rawktucc> it's an archer c7, it's because im using NAT beacuse... well there's more than one person on the network
[03:43:11] *** Joins: stonkey (~stonkey@user/stonkey)
[03:43:30] <rawktucc> and unfortunately ROGERS, the upstream ISP provider, will kill your cable connection if they detect two IPv4 addresses assign to one modem
[03:43:32] <rawktucc> i'm not kidding
[03:43:46] <rawktucc> the modem 10000% supports it, I did it for months, then service would die daily. etc etc
[03:44:02] <rawktucc> so yeah it's a tricky shituation
[03:44:07] <evilgohan2> no problem. that's got nothing to do with cut through routing which should be an option in most modern NAT routers.
[03:44:37] <evilgohan2> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-through_switching
[03:44:42] <rawktucc> Network > Switch?
[03:46:01] <rawktucc> I think I'd have to setup a vlan and quite possibly pass my server directly to the router. but really that doesn't matter
[03:46:03] <evilgohan2> as opposed to store and forward, cut through switching will push the packet the moment the intended address is identified as opposed to waiting for the entire packet to be received first
[03:47:27] <evilgohan2> hmm, looks like I did 9.37TiB in October
[03:47:54] <rawktucc> I did 3.21TB this past week
[03:48:02] <rawktucc> 1.42TB DOWN / 1.79TB UP
[03:48:06] <rawktucc> i will continue pushing the UP
[03:48:10] <rawktucc> i have a constant upload feed running
[03:48:12] <evilgohan2> but only 4.72TiB in October
[03:48:27] <evilgohan2> Interesting.
[03:48:37] <rawktucc> trust me, if I had gigabit I'd use it
[03:48:38] <rawktucc> for upload
[03:48:39] <evilgohan2> I lost all my old RRD data in July when I upgraded my box.
[03:48:42] <superkuh> $10 for every 50 GB over 1.2 TB (both ways together + overhead) here. :(
[03:48:47] <evilgohan2> or rather discarded the old box
