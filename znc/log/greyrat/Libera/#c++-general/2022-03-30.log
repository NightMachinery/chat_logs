[14:19:02] <PJBoy> it might be a little weird, but without it text mode is redundant
[14:19:18] <TinoDidriksen> Text mode should have never existed, imo.

[14:24:48] <PJBoy> so it would turn out then, that to truly deal with both \n and \r\n as newline tokens, you actually should load your file in binary mode and do a normalising pass
[14:25:14] <PJBoy> yuck
[14:25:50] <PJBoy> gives weight to the argument that there should be no text mode
[14:26:09] <LordKalma> vscode has a btutton on the bottom bar to convert line endings
[14:26:15] <LordKalma> so idc
[14:26:16] <PJBoy> that and the fact that it complicates file seeking
[14:26:17] <Haohmaru> who even reads text anyway
[14:26:25] <LordKalma> !grab Haohmaru
[14:26:25] <nolyc> LordKalma: The operation succeeded.
[14:26:42] <TinoDidriksen> There are many more line endings, so a normalization pass is required anyway.
[14:26:46] <LordKalma> when  I'm writing a .sh file on windows to run on my docker containers I select LF on the bottom bar
[14:26:48] <LordKalma> and life is good
[14:27:36] <PJBoy> yeah it's usually easy to specify line endings
[14:27:48] <Haohmaru> unless notepad.exe
[14:28:25] <PJBoy> notepad was like the last program that required the CR

[14:30:39] <LordKalma> windows 11 makes me want to use linux
[14:30:46] <PJBoy> haha
[14:30:56] <LordKalma> but the problem is that linux is shit on laptops
[14:30:56] <PJBoy> to notepad's credit, it loaded bing in my primary browser

[14:31:32] <LordKalma> now that you said it, yeah
[14:31:35] <LordKalma> itll be fixed
[14:31:48] <Haohmaru> because who needs alternative browsers
[14:32:14] <PJBoy> just wait until wandbox make a text editor
[14:32:39] <PJBoy> its search feature will only work if it opens in chrome >_>
[14:32:58] <PJBoy> or like 50% of modern firefoxes?
[14:34:11] <LordKalma> edge is chrome(ium ) anyway
[14:34:23] <Haohmaru> googlium
[14:35:03] <PJBoy> yeah, if I came into the technological world in 2022, it's unclear if I would switch browsers ever
[14:35:25] <PJBoy> back in the day it was IE v6/v7 versus firefox v2/v3
[14:35:45] <PJBoy> and it was easy to realise firefox was better in every way
[14:38:34] <Haohmaru> i was using IE 6 untill i went into some fishy websites and ended up with one of those viruses that hijacks your about:blank page and i couldn't get it off
[14:39:25] <PJBoy> ahahaha
[14:39:33] <Haohmaru> so i went looking for an alternative browser, found a bunch but the problem was still there (they were wrapping around IE basically), untill i found "firefox" .. the program was bigger so it looked promising that this is a real browser
[14:40:07] <Haohmaru> aaand i'm still with firefox
[14:40:13] <PJBoy> I was sold immediately when I learned it was skinnable
[14:40:19] <LordKalma> I'm still a FF resistant as well
[14:40:23] <LordKalma> but mozilla is going to shit anyway
[14:40:25] <PJBoy> and then discovered addons
[14:40:31] <Haohmaru> meh
[14:40:33] <PJBoy> and there was no going back from there
[14:40:36] <LordKalma> in fact, I use **Thundebird**
[14:40:44] <LordKalma> (which is not a mozilla product now anyway)
[14:40:56] <Haohmaru> well, it was convenient that there was a download manager addon
[14:41:04] <PJBoy> but it's called Mozilla Thunderbird
[14:41:11] <LordKalma> thunderbird doest hae ve fucking
[14:41:24] <LordKalma> *fucking support for exchange
[14:41:27] <LordKalma> PJBoy, it's not
[14:41:35] <LordKalma> It doesn't have Mozilla in the name
[14:42:10] <PJBoy> I guess it doesn't, huh
[14:42:20] <ville> PJBoy: except that ie6 was so dominant that you could expect that websites wouldn't actually render properly on mozilla products

[18:48:14] <Haohmaru> that's the opposite of what i want
[18:48:45] <Haohmaru> rpav this particular font has the unfortunate property that it has to be 10 pixels tall
[18:48:50] <Haohmaru> or was it 8
[18:49:06] <rpav> 10, though not really what i want myself
[18:49:34] <Haohmaru> so, if it was a vector font, the font size to get that pixel height is not 7 nor 8, but 7.5

[18:52:45] <Haohmaru> yes, that doesn't work
[18:52:51] <Haohmaru> no

[18:58:14] <Haohmaru> how about red text on black background, what exactly are you gonna "subpixel" there ;P~
[18:58:36] <rpav> i definitely agree that a _proper_ implementation should buffer subpixels (possibly a pixel with a vector) so when you make a screenshot, you can actually have antialiasing information _in the screenshot_ and properly subpixel-AA'd in a device-independent manner
[18:58:49] <rpav> i was thinking about this a few months back iirc
[18:59:32] <Haohmaru> this is why i turn this kind of crap off, i like vector graphics and fonts, so when i use them - no hinting, no subpixel crap
[18:59:34] <rpav> 4bpp AA buffer i think should be sufficient for that
[19:00:00] <Haohmaru> there's a way it could be done but it's complicated and not worth it
[19:00:02] <rpav> but at the same time, without subpixel AA at all, vector fonts look terrible and muddy at small sizes
[19:00:21] <Haohmaru> maybe the AA is wrong ;P~
[19:00:26] <Haohmaru> maybe the displays are crap
[19:00:29] <rpav> it's not
[19:00:32] <Haohmaru> maybe <both.gif>
[19:00:36] <rpav> they're not
[19:00:46] <Haohmaru> LCDs are wrong btw
[19:01:10] <Haohmaru> at least all i've seen (cheap ones i guess)
[19:01:10] <rpav> i am not about to go back to CRTs .. even the best are no match in crispness for even early LCDs
[19:01:21] <Haohmaru> being crisp is wrong
[19:01:35] <Haohmaru> expecting crispness is wrong
[19:01:42] <rpav> if you think that then you are factually wrong and there is no point in discussing it with you
[19:01:57] <Haohmaru> sinc()
[19:02:04] <Haohmaru> you know?
[19:02:17] <Haohmaru> that thing does not have sharp edges
[19:02:54] <Haohmaru> sharp edges means higher frequencies/overtones blahblah
[19:04:48] <Haohmaru> rpav if your printer didn't do dots or dot patterns but could ideally make perfect squares of solid color, and this is how you printed a picture - you'd hate it
[19:05:16] <Haohmaru> you'd be able to see the pixels as crisp squares
[19:05:58] <Haohmaru> and this is.. wrong, unless you intended to make it like that (this could make sense for certain scenarios, surely)
[19:07:10] <rpav> comparing print and display is utterly wrong

[19:10:14] <PJBoy> I don't think our eyes are good low pass filters
[19:10:18] <rpav> (the _actual_ ideal is hidpi, where it's slightly more analogous to print, but still incredibly different in every way)
[19:10:33] <Haohmaru> PJBoy they can be, when out-of-focus
[19:10:35] <PJBoy> walking past those parallel lines you get at some mall entrances makes a horrible aliasing effect
[19:10:51] <rpav> unfortunately like nothing but font rendering supports it very well and then all your text looks incredibly crisp and everything else looks fucked
[19:11:26] <Haohmaru> i should write a page about this ;]
[19:11:39] <Haohmaru> because it's difficult to see how everything is wrong
[19:11:50] <Haohmaru> difficult to believe
[19:12:04] <rpav> yes, produce an embarrassing display of your knowledge in the related fields for posterity ;)
[19:12:17] <ashafq> Font redering is very interesting topic, and a lot of it has a lot of amazing research.

[19:13:22] <ashafq> And I also feel bad for people writing font-renderers. It is a very hard thing to get right.
[19:13:44] <Haohmaru> ashafq font rendering on one side is merely vector to raster rendering, which itself is.. not rocket science, but when your display is wrong - the mathz goes in the trash
[19:13:49] <rpav> text in general is incredibly complicated, and every part needs data from all the other parts
[19:14:18] <PJBoy> hence why you need a phd to render coloured text in the windows terminal

[19:14:32] <Haohmaru> on the other hand font rendering needs to be fast because it's full of text everywhere, thus it also needs crazy cheats and optimizations
[19:14:34] <ashafq> Haohmaru: if you're on linux, you'll have to know the orientation of your LCD panel (RGB, BGR, etc.)
[19:14:52] <ashafq> If you set the right setting, then everything will look fine.
[19:14:56] <Haohmaru> ashafq what for?
[19:14:56] <rpav> you do on windows too, have you ever configured cleartype?
[19:15:04] <ashafq> for subpixel AA
[19:15:11] <rpav> i mean it shows you, but there are linux tools too
[19:15:40] <rpav> i just wish i could get linux fonts looking as good as windows
[19:15:44] <ashafq> I think that should be a setting from the display or a message from the monitor
[19:15:44] <rpav> at least on non-arch
[19:15:56] <Haohmaru> rpav btw, the fact that cleartype "configuration" exist demonstrates clearly that monitors are wrong, so you compensate by bending the maths to try to compensate
[19:15:56] <ashafq> or it probably is
[19:16:17] <ashafq> Haohmaru: Either nothing is wrong, or everything is wrong...
[19:16:42] <Haohmaru> ashafq subpixel AA is wrong, i turn it off
[19:16:49] <ashafq> Haohmaru: If you can read the text on screen, then it's fine...
[19:16:52] <rpav> ashafq: it isn't, but ideally it _should_ be pushed more toward the hardware, but that's also hard .. most things expect to be able to render to a flat RGBA/RGB/R buffer and not have to have a separate field or buffer for AA
[19:16:58] <PJBoy> I don't understand the argument against subpixel AA
[19:17:28] <rpav> PJBoy: first you have to not understand subpixel AA
[19:17:55] <ashafq> Haohmaru: it depends on the content, like I said. for text subpixel AA can help with bitmap fonts.
[19:18:05] <PJBoy> it was said that it doesn't make sense on coloured text
[19:18:05] <Haohmaru> PJBoy the way it's currently done is, you are rendering a picture, adding fringes to it, which supposedly should look a certain way on your monitor, HOWEVER, the image itself is now "wrong" and will not look "right" on a different monitor
[19:18:10] <rpav> it's probably possible for one to have only seen cheap displays with poor pixel layout where subpixel AA is not going to work, but
[19:18:27] <Haohmaru> PJBoy basically, you give me a screenshot, i view it - it looks "bad"
[19:18:35] <Haohmaru> because i'm in portrait mode here
[19:18:39] <Haohmaru> or because different monitor
[19:18:48] <rpav> ^ this is right, ideally, but wrong, practically
[19:18:53] <PJBoy> I see
[19:19:00] <Haohmaru> and it's too late at this point to do anything, the image has been rendered, the damage has been done
[19:19:14] <PJBoy> same would be true of using multiple monitors I guess
[19:19:25] <PJBoy> the text could only look optimal on one of them
[19:19:27] <ashafq> Interesting... why would subpixel AA go in the screenshot? Shouldn't it be later in the grapic pipeline?
[19:19:44] <Haohmaru> ashafq i was explaining how it works *now*
[19:19:56] *** Joins: kenanmarasli (~kenanmara@user/kenanmarasli)
[19:19:58] <rpav> ashafq: it isn't, because graphics handling is dumb
[19:20:14] <Haohmaru> the only way subpixel rendering could make sense is if it was part of the display device
[19:20:18] <ashafq> I mean, that's the problem then.
[19:20:21] <rpav> it's surprising everyone hasn't actually noticed this in the last 20 years of screenshots on the web
[19:20:32] <rpav> plenty of "why does this text look like it has so much red and blue"
[19:20:50] <Haohmaru> rpav i always notice the fringes
[19:20:55] <ashafq> rpav: screenshots... ok there is another issue there
[19:21:15] <ashafq> rpav, Haohmaru: JPEG or any lossy image coding are terrible with texts
[19:21:17] <rpav> Haohmaru: you probably have your rendering misconfigured then; proper lcd filtering will minimize visible fringe to you
[19:21:41] <Haohmaru> rpav i meant in other people's screenshots
[19:21:50] <Haohmaru> i don't use subpixel AA
[19:21:52] <rpav> it's a limited problem though .. unless you take a lot of screenshots with rendered text, you are not likely to be affected
[19:22:01] <ashafq> It goes back to the principle of FFTs of straight lines. You'll need infinite number of cosine terms in order to approximate a straight line.
[19:22:26] <ashafq> and most image codecs use sums of cosines, until recently with HEIF
[19:22:37] <Haohmaru> rpav some drawing programs put subpixel AA when you draw text
[19:22:43] <Haohmaru> ..like, no problem
[19:23:09] <rpav> Haohmaru: yeah that is pretty dumb heh
[19:23:11] <Haohmaru> well, MS Paint does, that doesn't really count as a proper example of a drawing program
[19:23:32] <Haohmaru> but "if MS Paint does it, then we should probably do it too, right"
[19:23:48] <Haohmaru> "f*ck yeah! subpixel AA is the right way!"
[19:23:59] <ashafq> Haohmaru: I think you're mixing two different problems in one.
[19:24:13] <rpav> he is
[19:24:21] <Haohmaru> no, just multiple problems are weaved into a filthy fabric
[19:24:26] <Haohmaru> ;P~
[19:25:27] <Haohmaru> but normal users shall not be aware of this, because we gotta sell all these 8K TVs
[19:26:11] <rpav> but hidpi makes subpixel AA _less_ necessary
[19:26:34] <rpav> subpixel aa is a hack for gaining resolution; with hidpi you get real resolution
[19:27:25] <rpav> (this is conflating DPI and resolution somewhat, of course.. what you want is higher dpi, and 4K/8K are orthogonal to that)
[19:28:56] <rpav> like this surface go has pretty nice/crisp (but not _pixelated_) fonts because it's 1920x1280 .. on a 10.5" screen
[19:28:58] <Haohmaru> you don't gain any resolution on red text
[19:29:02] <Haohmaru> zero
[19:30:38] <rpav> you seem to think that and think that the perceptual color is somehow directly driven by actual pixel colors and heavily influence by subpixel colors

[19:31:06] <Haohmaru> hm?
[19:31:10] <rpav> and/or that you also don't adjust the subpixel rendering based on color
[19:31:38] <Haohmaru> sure, show me a "good" subpixel AA rendering of a pure red text on a black background
[19:31:46] <Haohmaru> let me see how it's done
[19:32:21] <Haohmaru> it'll either be fringed, or not, will it be shifted tho? who knows
[19:33:54] <rpav> Haohmaru: or maybe you'll use additional red subpixels with partial brightness :p
[19:34:06] <Haohmaru> additional?
[19:34:22] <Haohmaru> do you grow them on trees somewhere between the normal pixels?
[19:34:30] <rpav> in a pure color case you're not going to get additional resolution sure
[19:34:39] <rpav> i mean over "regular" AA
[19:34:44] <Haohmaru> well, that's what i said
[19:35:00] <rpav> but "well in this one case that's rare you only do as well as regular AA" is not an argument for "so never do subpixel aa"
[19:35:04] <Haohmaru> so, then there's the little question - will the letter be shifted then
[19:35:10] <rpav> especially when one rarely has pure R/G/B text
[19:35:28] <rpav> the letters are always shifted if they're pure R/G/B depending on your pixel layout
[19:35:37] <rpav> regardless of antialiasing
[19:35:37] <Haohmaru> exactly
[19:35:57] <rpav> this is still not an argument against subpixel AA
[19:36:00] <Haohmaru> it's wrong on multiple levels ;]
[19:36:40] <rpav> if nothing else it's an argument for higher DPI, but GUIs have been slow to adapt
[19:36:45] <ashafq> Haohmaru: or just get a 4K monitor. Even if your cleartype settings are wrong, you won't see it 😉
[19:37:29] <rpav> really we have the opposite problem .. fonts get super crispy and everything else still assumes rendering specific pixels to images produces OK results
[19:38:01] <rpav> and there's very little support for like, graphical hinting and scaling
[19:38:07] <Haohmaru> the "right" way to do it would be to provide enough information (or extra resolution) towards the display, and then the display, which should know its fuggly pixel geometry and flaws, would use that extra information to do any kind of subpixel crap, while your image (in the program/buffer/clipboard/etc) won't be fringed or "wrong"
[19:38:24] <rpav> Haohmaru: i absolutely agree there
[19:38:42] <Haohmaru> but this is very difficult and perhaps not worth it
[19:39:15] <Haohmaru> it's IMO more important for displays to try to reproduce digital images more properly
[19:39:49] <Haohmaru> that means, fix the pixel geometry.. add lowpass filters if needed.. etc..
[19:39:51] <rpav> i don't think it's _very_ difficult but i also haven't PoC'd it so it's very possibly more than my initial thought
[19:40:47] <Haohmaru> maybe very expensive monitors exist which put more effort into picture reproduction, but i haven't seen them
