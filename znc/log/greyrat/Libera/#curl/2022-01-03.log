[11:25:26] <rgrinberg> Is there a way to get a response's status code as soon as it becomes available? From what I can tell, I need to wait until the entire request completes - e.g. the response body is downloaded.
[11:26:50] *** Joins: martiert (~martiert@ti0185q160-2775.bb.online.no)
[11:30:20] <bagder> you mean with CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE ?
[11:33:59] <rgrinberg> yeah
[11:34:06] <jfuller> or maybe just do a HEAD first
[11:34:16] <jfuller> if its confirming access
[11:35:25] <bagder> rgrinberg: CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE works to retrieve immediately after the status line has been received by libcurl...
[11:35:41] <bagder> I should probably document that
[11:36:03] <rgrinberg> bagder how do I know when the status line has been set?
[11:36:14] <rgrinberg> s/set/received/
[11:36:16] <bagder> if CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE is non-zero? =)
[11:36:37] <bagder> or you have a header callback set
[11:36:57] <rgrinberg> Yes, but I mean when do I check? I do have the header callback set
[11:37:07] <rgrinberg> I suppose there will always be at least 1 header?
[11:37:11] <bagder> the first call to the callback is the status line
[11:37:15] <bagder> yes
[11:37:25] <bagder> that will always be there for HTTP
[11:38:27] <rgrinberg> The header callback receives the status line? I must have missed that in the docs
[11:40:05] <bagder> it does
[11:40:11] <bagder> the docs is not very clear on that...
[11:40:13] <rgrinberg> Indeed i misread
[11:40:19] <rgrinberg> >  For an HTTP transfer, the status line and the blank line preceding the response body are both included as headers and passed to this function.
[11:40:28] <bagder> yeah

[14:27:51] <kushal> bagder, icing, a bit OT question: who all would be good people (on IRC) to ask questions related to CAs? specially if I looking for guidance while write one application for the same. 
[14:29:20] <icing> kushal: I do not know people on IRC on that topic, really. But it is also a very broad topic. What particular aspect of "an application for a CA" are you looking at?
[14:30:09] <kushal> icing, for smaller orgs to have private CA system (using HSM), signing certs/crl/ocsp etc. 
[14:30:35] <kushal> icing, we currently have one using bash, I am hoping to replace that with something that can deal more number of certs.
[14:30:57] <kushal> icing, https://github.com/leifj/ici this is the existing system. 
[14:34:49] <icing> kushal: Hmm, I see. I'd expect if you grow a "small, internal CA" to handle more certs, you will run into the same problems that large CAs need to solve, eventually.
[14:36:52] <kushal> icing, yes, so I am trying to keep the scaling part in mind. 
[14:37:22] <icing> kushal: the person I myself would talk to is Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, who is one of the lead guys at Let's Encrypt. He is @j4cob on twitter. Not on irc afaik. Maybe he can point you somewhere.
[14:39:04] <icing> As to implementations, the 'boulder' server used by Lets Encrypt is on github and runs in docker images. As ACME test server, 'pebble' is quite small, but that one does not support OCSP.
[14:40:29] <kushal> icing, yes, I was looking at boulder repo and then looked at cfssl repo too, may be I will have to read the source properly (I am also planning to write it in go). 
[14:41:21] <icing> kushal: if go is on the menu anyway, i would look a boulder closely, see what it can do for you and what may be missing. You at least know that that server can scale...
[14:41:47] <kushal> icing, thanks for reminding about Jacob, I forgot that I can ping him :)
