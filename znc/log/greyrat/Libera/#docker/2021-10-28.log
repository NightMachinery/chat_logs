[00:00:10] <kittonian> awstats is just perl btw
[00:00:44] <kittonian> i guess i need some way to test whether or not it's working with awstats and from just viewing the web pages of awstats it's unclear
[00:00:56] <tabakhase> sure that
[00:01:28] <kittonian> it would make sense that I would also need to install it in the apache container right?
[00:01:47] <tabakhase> if geoip were a tcp/ip or even socket thing on the host you could expose/call that, but likely thats a cli exec call or so
[00:01:47] <kittonian> there's no way it could just use the host's install of geoip from what I can see
[00:02:07] <kittonian> correct, it's an exec thing
[00:02:15] <kittonian> it's not a service
[00:03:50] <kittonian> aha! maybe it is working
[00:04:02] <kittonian> i didn't realize when I wrote the Dockerfile I had it installing libgeoip2-perl
[00:04:30] <kittonian> i probably also need to install the actual geoip2 and set it to update, but at least it's somewhat there

[11:41:16] <dngray> is it possible to have a custom network defined, and also use the internal bridge?
[11:41:42] <dngray> so i have a webserver docker container, it has a primary interface which is macvlan and serves to my LAN, and it has a secondary interface that is a bridge to the host
[11:41:51] <dngray> looks like this https://clbin.com/vVNr7
[11:42:23] <dngray> the network for external_v4 is defined seperately
[11:42:53] <dngray> what i want to know is can i use the bridge interface
[11:43:02] <dngray> bridge                   bridge    local
[11:43:13] <dngray> with my external_v4 interface without defining it.

[12:36:36] <talin> hello. i am thinking of using docker at home, such that i can easily move services between machines. do i need something like a "docker hub" at home to be able to do that?
[12:36:52] <dob1> dngray, I don't understand how docker know if my rules includes docker rules
[12:37:16] <dngray> talin: no docker hub is basically like pre-made docker containers
[12:37:22] <dngray> it's a repository
[12:37:45] <talin> dngray: aha. hmm, so how could i move a container to another machine?
[12:38:07] <dngray> wouldn't really need to
[12:38:17] <dngray> you'd just download it again, and use docker-compose to re-create it
[12:38:49] <dngray> with your docker-compose recipe you would be able to re-create everything, all you'd need to do is copy some data you might be passing into the container
[12:39:41] <talin> dngray: so i could use a Dockerfile to re-create everything, for example? and a repo with config files?
[12:39:51] <dngray> no, docker-compse.yml
[12:40:03] <dngray> Dockerfile is build instructions, so if the docker container needs some custom stuff done to it
[12:40:17] <dngray> you can base it off something else, like alpine linux then the Dockerfile might pull in some packages.
[12:40:32] <dngray> the docker-compose.yml would contain specific configuration environmental variables etc, passed in
[12:40:36] <dngray> mount points those kinds of things
[12:40:51] <talin> i thought docker-compose.yml was when you needed to set up multiple machines and start them in a specific order
[12:40:56] <dngray> docker isn't really like a virtual machine or a lxd container, it's meant to be stateless
[12:41:10] <dngray> talin: no it's a recipe, and you should always have them
[12:41:14] <dngray> it makes like a lot less painful
[12:41:25] <talin> interesting. thanks a lot, i will look into compose

[14:57:05] <ThothCastel> about  running a monitoring platform out of a container in linux - is that out of 'best practice'?
[14:57:30] <dngray> i would use linux host, with linux containers unless you really need windows for something
[14:57:31] <ThothCastel> for instance, run solarwinds or prtg in a container
[14:57:35] <dngray> and then you'll need a virtual machine
[14:58:27] <ThothCastel> ok but would it be ok to have the monitoring platform inside of a container as opposed to having the host hosting the monitoring platform?
[14:58:47] <ThothCastel> assuming the monitoring platform is linux based os
[14:58:50] <dngray> everything should be in a container
[14:59:01] <dngray> that is good practice, there is no reason to run it on the host

[15:27:53] <luva> where?
[15:28:23] <luva> normally using docker run creates already a network etc.
[15:28:43] <luva> where ip and subnet etc is set for ipv4, this isnt done automatically for ipv6?
[15:30:17] <dngray> you can specify a subnet and gateway for ipv6 too, or use dhcp
[15:30:34] <dngray> for macvlan you can really do anything you want
[15:31:01] <tabakhase> (note that afaik this is still a OR, not a AND to enable ipv6)
[15:31:21] <dngray> i have containers which have ipv6, and ipv4 on macvlan
[15:31:23] <tabakhase> usually just fine, but some things dont work with the "4in6" stuff thats used then for v4 traffic
[15:31:43] <dngray> oh i never do that, always dual stack
[15:32:16] <tabakhase> macvlan is its own story.. - i didnt scroll all the way up if thats what ya were talkn about i said nothing :D
[15:32:28] <luva> Im sorry, I think im not following correctly... Normally what happened when I ran a container is, it created a network automatically called <container-name_default> and then also added automatically IP, subnet etc. 
[15:33:20] <luva> is it possible to just run a container and let it automatically create a network that uses ipv4 and ipv6 without me setting subnet etc? so it just chooses itself?
[15:33:28] <tabakhase> forgotmynick may one ask why you wanne use macvlan? (like, thers only one maybe two 'agreed' reasons todo it generally :P)

[20:39:45] <zsnes> is there anyway to have docker use host networking while on a VPN but still support inter-docker networking with docker-compose?
[20:40:18] <zsnes> my containers can not access the internet due to the VPN routing when not using host networking...but if I use host networking I can't network between containers within docker.. :P
[20:40:51] <zsnes> due to the insane cisco anyconnect vpn that decides to route everything, even LAN traffic
[20:43:04] <DogHackit> zsnes: I used to use that VPN for my last job, and it did not allow for split tunneling. Not sure if that was by admin configuration, but that might be why you can't do what you are trying to do.
[20:43:06] <minimal> zsnes: that's usually a "security" feature of corporate VPNs configuration - send everything via VPN (i.e. on to corporate network) to ensure no corporate data leaks out any other route
[20:43:30] <zsnes> right, which makes no sense
[20:43:36] <zsnes> because you can just disable it and then do whatever you want
[20:44:12] <minimal> zsnesL it makes sense for the corporate/enterprise orgs if they're supplying you with a device to only be used for corporate purposes :-)
[20:44:16] <zsnes> unfortunately the containers also need to access things on the VPN :/
[20:45:24] <DogHackit> Run the containers in a VM? Might be able to accomplish both things, but admittedly dumb...
[20:45:30] <zsnes> apparently this works on MAC docker? i was reading and apparently MAC docker infastructure actually spins up a linux VM underneath?
[20:45:35] <zsnes> so is that why it would work on mac?

[22:33:06] <tabakhase> ada_ what where when?  the poor-mans? wasnt that about "non-swarm" anyhow? - anyhow not my issue :D
[22:33:14] <ada_> tabakhase: idk what you mean by that
[22:33:27] <ada_> tabakhase: if you have a swarm service that has tasks, then, you can docker run --net container:$containerid  
[22:33:47] <ada_> you cannot create a swarm service like "docker service create --net service:..."  or "docker service create --net container:..."
[22:34:07] <tabakhase> k makes sense
[22:34:30] <ada_> you could always create a container inside another container's namespaces, but services aren't containers so yeah

[23:35:14] <programmerq> zoredacheâ–¸ I have the same problem with my non-task containers attaching to an attachable overlay network. The restart policy fires before the network is actually available. I ended up writing a cron to try to start them until I can port it to a different type of setup (probably kube)

[23:36:22] <programmerq> raxor2kâ–¸ I don't see what error you're running into in that paste.
[23:37:39] <programmerq> make sure that the numeric uid/gid of the folder has the appropriate file mode/permissions for the numeric uid of the process trying to interact with it inside the container.
[23:38:34] <raxor2k> whaat
[23:40:17] <tabakhase> raxor2k for a start, lets call that mounts, not volumes (both -v, but very different)
[23:41:11] <tabakhase> for ids, basically "studdy this readme top to bottom two or three times, then things will make sense" - if you actually have to use this tool, some lines of shell, or can get away with pure docker --user "depends" https://github.com/boxboat/fixuid

[23:41:50] <evon> tabakhase: So the way have traefik setup, are other containers the only programs that will be able to use it?  Is it possible to use traefik with another vm in qemu?
[23:42:44] <raxor2k> tabakhase :you see the both folders "trained_model" and "transformation" problem is that the files are not downloaded to those folders !!!!!
[23:42:46] <tabakhase> raxor2k sollution is rather simple, but gasping the problem and selecting the right one is a huge wtf if one hits docker the first time :D, maybe even try em all
