[07:43:37] <gilberth> SVG is underspecified IMHO. For drawing elliptical arcs you specify a start point, and end point, a major axis, a minor axis and a rotation of the whole ellipse. The start and end angles are implicit. For the two solutions of whether the larger or the smaller arc is to be drawn, there is a flag. It doesn't say however in which coordinate system those angles are measures.
[07:45:11] <gilberth> CLIM also has a missing bit. You can't have an elliptical running backwards, that is clock-wise [unless you setup a reflecting transformation]. Which way we go makes a difference to dashing the thing.

[07:56:34] <hayley> gilberth: What I find funny is that the critique tends to be, say, consumer-oriented ("Most users cannot read source code, they just want something that works") whereas the solutions are producer-oriented ("The community is everyone who sends me Patreon money").
[07:57:28] <hayley> In a way, the real solution is to annihilate both and find producer-consumers who can hack, but it is still funny to me.
[07:57:51] <gilberth> Sounds like they should better just found a company.
[07:59:26] <hayley> Indeed.

[08:03:07] <hayley> Really, it is a combination of people pulling discrete "communities" out of thin air, and thinking programming is always hard, so it is unimportant to support programmers in any way other than an income stream. Been there once or twice before.

[08:05:36] <hayley> No, rather that it is always hard, and so (I don't think anyone drew the implication arrow, but it vaguely fits) you can't throw anything at it other than money.
[08:06:38] <hayley> No need for learning good programming design, no need to reuse source code. As long as you feed your hacker $20/hour they will somehow get by.
[08:07:32] <hayley> And, furthermore, there is no way anyone else would want to learn programming. So they can continue this dumb producer-consumer distinction.
[08:07:51] <gilberth> This is silly. People like to do hard things, even if it's not for money. Not everyone is lazy.
[08:08:33] <hayley> I mean that even the easy problems are apparently "too hard for most people to hack". Which, of course, may be the case if you teach people bad design, and only use C or Rust...
[08:09:11] <gilberth> Oh dear. Not everyone is supposed to write an RE engine, e.g.

[08:14:52] <hayley> But, say I had 1,000 transitive dependencies, would I really be expected to sign up with 1,000 communities?
[08:15:26] <gilberth> No. At that is not my idea of "free" in any sense.
[08:16:01] <hayley> Apparently the license allows for transitive licensing, wherein the authors of some code pay the authors of their dependencies, and you just pay the authors, but that is still a lot of bookkeeping.
[08:16:04] <gilberth> Granted, I guess, proper design is hard. But just hacking sth? Not so much.
[08:16:05] <hayley> gilberth: Finally we agree on "free" for once.
[08:16:50] <hayley> They don't make proper design any easier, because they use C and teach very bad design practises.
[08:17:29] <gilberth> But that is orthogonal to the license. And: There could be good design in C, too.
[08:18:17] <hayley> On paper, yes, but there seems to be a correlation in practise.
[08:19:01] <hayley> For example, in the introductory text on <https://anticapitalist.software/>: "ACSL recognizes that the copyleft requirement of open source can be a drain on limited resources, can **expose sensitive or secure information**, and can put **software at risk of theft.**"

[08:19:34] <hayley> (Emphasis mine.) What fucking design are you using where your source code can be used to pwn you, and how does one steal source code if it is permissively licensed?
[08:20:50] <gilberth> Right. /me reads.
[08:21:58] <hayley> These people haven't heard of Kerckhoff's principle and/or Shannon's maxim, which both approximate to "Your system should be secure even if someone knows everything about them"?

[08:52:16] <hayley> Also https://soundcloud.com/user-308419292/opus-number-one-theme-for-great-cities-medley as I wrote my own hold music in February.
[08:52:36] <gilberth> It's a myth that network transparency would make things slow.
[08:52:55] <gilberth> hayley: Hold music? For your Netfarm hotline?
[08:53:06] <hayley> While transferring universities.
[08:53:18] <hayley> gilberth: No, we just have a very long book you are told to re-read.
[08:54:05] <gilberth> Ok, then.
[08:54:37] <gilberth> hayley: Have you composed that tune?
[08:54:50] <hayley> https://cal-coop.gitlab.io/netfarm/documentation/decentralise2.html I wonder what the LOC of book to LOC of code ratio is.
[08:54:51] -ixelp- 3 decentralise2
[08:54:54] <hayley> gilberth: Both covers.
[08:55:18] <gilberth> Still nice!
[08:55:44] <hayley> 3742 LOC of Lisp, 821 LOC of Scribble markup. But the latter looks pretty long to me.
[08:58:29] <gilberth> By that ratio I should be done with CLIM. The spec has 21,478 lines of LaTeX.
[08:58:45] <hayley> Well, my documentation is not done.
[08:59:32] <gilberth> The CLIM spec also isn't. It get's poorer the further you read.
[09:00:45] <hayley> At least I have a claim that I have a relatively good looking spec.
[09:03:02] <gilberth> Hey, my HTML rendering of the CLIM spec looks good, too!
[09:03:15] <hayley> Hey, I didn't say yours didn't look good.
[09:03:33] <gilberth> Good. For you. ;)
[09:04:13] <hayley> 5.3.4 looks good when TeXed. I have one of the pages printed out which I compared to the typesetting in AMOP.
[09:04:56] * gilberth doesn't remember the typesetting of AMOP.

[09:08:41] <gilberth> A finally proper "defun style" with the hline above. You didn't want to indent a defuns description?
[09:09:12] <hayley> Apparently not. Though the sections for tricky arguments and return values are indented.
[09:09:44] <gilberth> Looks nice with all the notation.
[09:10:04] <hayley> Yes, all a drugged up SECD machine.

[09:11:14] <gilberth> Hello dave0, how are you?
[09:11:19] <dave0> gilberth: you lost your braces!
[09:11:49] * gilberth quickly claims the spaces.
[09:11:55] <hayley> gilberth: AMOP uses the hline, but I found it all verbose. Especially for reader methods.
[09:12:46] <{gilberth}> dave0: IRC nicks are case-insenstive, so it's brackets actually.
[09:13:52] <dave0> aha
[09:14:03] <dave0> oh man i'm seeing double
[09:14:05] <hayley> At least I convinced TeX to not page-break in the middle of a function description. But given I have the @definitions{ ... } wrapper, I could just indent everything.
[09:14:07] <gilberth> hayley: I have seen the hlines a lot. Perhaps it's an Lisp Machine thing?

[09:15:10] <gilberth> Four? Hell no, that is more than the world could bear.
[09:15:11] <hayley> Hm, I don't have a VM handy. Ask Joswig?
[09:15:23] <hayley> Or stylewarning?
[09:16:40] <gilberth> hayley: No it's not. e.g. <http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/mit/cadr/chinual_5thEd_Jan83/chinualJan83_13_Locatives.pdf>
[09:17:04] <hayley> No, @definitions covers the defun line too. Won't work. Though the vertical spacing for \textsc{Arguments} is wrong - there's more between the body and header than between the header and prior text.
[09:17:09] <gilberth> hayley: My VM with OpenGenera is on another machine in the evil house.
[09:18:18] <dave0> hayley: are you writing a lisp program using knuths literate thingy?
[09:18:29] <hayley> dave0: Nope, this is documentation.
[09:18:40] <dave0> ah ok
[09:18:46] <dave0> so just tex ?
[09:18:51] <gilberth> hayley: It's pretty hard to tell TeX that you don't want page breaks. It has is own mind despite of a ton of penalties.
[09:19:11] <hayley> Racket Scribble, rather than TeX. I ported away from TeX so I could get a sane web version.

[09:20:25] <gilberth> Count the \nopagebreak's in <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/defun-sty/defun.sty> in a futile attempt to make TeX listen.
[09:20:32] <hayley> n.b. The "trivial" proof at the end was not trivial for ELS referees. Just saying.
[09:21:34] <hayley> I ended up using a LaTeX minipage apparently.
[09:21:48] <gilberth> Actually I like CSS better, would there be a typesetter for it.
[09:22:28] <gilberth> hayley: Ah, the minipage, the tactical nuke.
[09:22:42] <hayley> I have about three environment definitions with minipages.
[09:25:09] <moon-child> gilberth: you prefer box-based layout to constraint-based layout?
[09:25:51] <gilberth> lol. Look at page 8: <http://bitsavers.org/pdf/symbolics/software/genera_8/Symbolics_Common_Lisp_Dictionary.pdf>
[09:26:51] <gilberth> Escaping seriously gone wrong.
[09:26:53] <hayley> Look at the first definition. ≠ is equivalent to CL's =?
[09:27:10] <gilberth> moon-child: TeX is too procedural for me.
[09:27:26] <gilberth> hayley: No, the zl:\\ operator.
[09:27:34] <hayley> What the hell?
[09:27:35] <moon-child> gilberth: hm, that is fair
[09:27:40] <hayley> Yes, a fair few backslashes.
[09:28:08] <White_Flame> yeah, ??? "In your new programs, we recommend that you use function =, which is the Common Lisp equivalent of ≠."
[09:28:11] <gilberth> DSSSL isn't too bad, but no fun to work with.
[09:29:32] <contrapunctus> gilberth: I was looking into DSSSL recently. Had to go to IA for about every piece of documentation 😄
[09:30:35] <gilberth> That is exactly 2^11 backslashes in a row.

[09:31:15] <gilberth> contrapunctus: It's long, long, long ago that we once used that.
[09:31:33] <gilberth> So that is 11 times escaped, not?
[09:31:43] *** Joins: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec)
[09:32:58] <contrapunctus> gilberth: why is DSSSL no fun for you to work with?
[09:34:21] <gilberth> I just remember having had not so much fun, although I liked the idea. But again, this is more than 20 years ago.
[09:34:30] <contrapunctus> Ah.
[09:35:16] <contrapunctus> I'd like to write a new stylesheet language for my word processor format rather than reuse CSS or something, but I've also had very little working experience with stylesheet languages, so I don't know how I might improve upon the existing ones.
[09:37:25] <gilberth> Well, I like the simple box model of CSS, with its merging margins. The style language itself could sure be improved. But then: Browsers don't implement everything. Have a macro language in between the markup and the DOM, it could be a rather good typesetting system.
[09:38:18] <gilberth> As in: You often need DIVs and SPANs with no semantic value, but for setting margins, padding etc.
[09:40:01] <gilberth> One of my ideas for a product was once a proper HTML/CSS typesetter for print. But then there already is Prince.
[09:41:33] <contrapunctus> Hm...I started out with purely declarative format for structure and style, with something akin to variables and macros...then moved to something similar except any component (document nodes, style data, etc) can also be substituted by a reference to a document node containing source code which emits that component when evaluated.
[09:42:03] <gilberth> It does a fair job, e.g. <https://css4.pub/2015/textbook/somatosensory.pdf>
[09:44:58] <gilberth> contrapunctus: I am perhaps biased. But look at CSS1 and see how simple it is. After all how sophisticated should the typesetter really be?
[09:45:54] <gilberth> My difficulties with Closure were not so much in the CSS part, but in Netscape.
[09:46:24] <gilberth> And the slow machines we had.
[09:56:59] <gilberth> Here is an arc with a tiny gap: The SVG idea of how to specify then leads to instabilities: <http://free-clim.org/svg-instability.mp4> The outer arc is my reference rendering using a polyline.
[09:57:22] <gilberth> So much for that. Guess I'll then use the Bezier approximation.
[09:57:46] <gilberth> Which almost certain is used internally anyway.
[09:58:56] <gilberth> They could have asked one, who knows a bit about vector graphics.

[18:50:22] <shka> nah
[18:50:26] <shka> it is all real
[18:50:42] <shka> and Thatcher decided that they have become to powerful :P
[18:52:55] <selwyn> actually she did not privatise british rail, but she didn´t like them at all
[18:53:14] <selwyn> the advanced passenger train was cancelled under her
[18:54:53] <shka> the funny part is that the british rail started out as a nationalization effort because smaller private companies were inadequate 
[18:56:43] <lotuseater> at when time period was that?

[18:59:17] <lotuseater> here in Germany I think all railways are "owned" by Deutsche Bahn like with the data pipelines by Telekom. with the electric pipelines I'm not sure, E.On or others
[18:59:20] <selwyn> the full story before that is much more complicated, smaller ones had alliances, rivalries and mergers with each other
[19:00:38] <shka> iirc it was a problem because stuff like "you own the train, but we own the rails so fuck you" was pretty common
[19:01:16] <selwyn> that´s not far from the problem now :D
[19:01:20] <lotuseater> privatizing such things is also a great idea. not.
[19:01:39] <shka> selwyn: yeah, this is why this is funny
[19:01:43] <aeth> As far as private railway goes, all I can think of is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Mania
[19:02:10] <shka> oh look, XIX century tech bubble 
[19:02:16] <aeth> well, no
[19:02:21] <selwyn> whenever an incident happens on the railways, there is an inquiry to determine whether it is the fault of the state or the train operating company
[19:02:39] <aeth> if you compare it, compare it to the 1990s telecom bubble that was related to the tech bubble but actually produced something (the miles and miles of dark fiber that eventually got used)
[19:03:25] <aeth> such an obvious analogy that it's in the article :-)
[19:03:26] <selwyn> i agree with aeth
[19:03:26] <shka> eh, even bubbles are worse nowadays :P
[19:03:36] <selwyn> also imo with the belt and road stuff
[19:03:57] <selwyn> people who highlight unprofitability of some ventures miss the point
[19:03:58] <aeth> China has a lot of those sorts of things right now
[19:04:02] <aeth> like, don't they have entirely empty cities?
[19:04:07] <aeth> because the real estate is so bubbly?
[19:04:23] <selwyn> aeth: i have heard that some of these empty cities have gone on to fill up with people after some time
[19:04:57] <shka> infrastructure is not supposed to be profitable 
[19:05:10] <aeth> selwyn: yes, which is probably why the government let the bubble go on
[19:05:10] <shka> it is supposed to make everything else more profitable 
[19:05:11] <lotuseater> oh i forgot above "things like water"
[19:05:19] <selwyn> shka: yes but tell that to britain :(
[19:05:33] <aeth> if you have things like empty railways or dead fiber or empty apartments or whatever, and there's a use for it, eventually people will move in. Just after the investors lose their money.
[19:05:41] <shka> selwyn: and that's why early capitalists were also socialists
[19:06:14] <selwyn> if a train hits a small bird the company is responsible, while if it hits a large bird the state is responsible
[19:06:25] <selwyn> so when a train hit a peacock, there was a big dispute over how big a peacock is
[19:06:58] <selwyn> answer: it is a large bird, which was apparently shown by comparing them to geese
[19:07:28] <aeth> sounds like some kind of medieval philosophical debate
[19:07:39] <aeth> except for the train part
[19:07:58] <aeth> I'd have to agree, though. I'd call it a large bird
[19:08:30] <selwyn> it sounds like the kind of parody soviet style inefficiency that privatising infrastructure was supposed to solve

[19:59:51] <gilberth> Google is really getting worse. It seems to kinda ignore the keywords I search for and show me what's popular for just one of the keywords.
[20:00:32] <gilberth> Often the results don't even mention all the keywords I search for.
[20:03:16] <selwyn> why couldn´t you drink coffee?
[20:05:57] <gilberth> Don't know. It would accelerate my already high heart rate. Wasn't good for me.
[20:05:59] <selwyn> i find it hard to understand why the eu wants to make track operators and train operators separate. are they trying to make cross border services easier
[20:06:30] <lotuseater> duckduckgo has some builtin capabilities for searching
[20:07:17] <gilberth> selwyn: Well, the EU believes in privatization.
[20:07:36] <selwyn> but why
[20:07:53] <selwyn> just as a matter of ideology? or are there pragmatic reasons
[20:07:58] <gilberth> Because "It's good for the economy"
[20:08:08] <selwyn> right
[20:09:19] <gilberth> Although I am quite in liberal political spectrum, I never liked too much privatization.
[20:09:53] <gilberth> I mean, that's infrastructure after all.
[20:11:07] <selwyn> indeed
[20:11:40] <gilberth> But it's the same idea as with the telephone network, where you have private ISPs using landlines of the formally public phone company. It has both it's bright and dark sides.
[20:12:04] <selwyn> well
[20:12:13] * gilberth once used a 9600bps modem, which was "illegal".
[20:12:46] <selwyn> i don´t like privatisation of the rail services, because you are in effect privatising the only part of the network, the train services
[20:12:59] <selwyn> which can actually make revenue and profit
[20:13:49] <gilberth> Are your rail tracks in private hand?
[20:13:54] <selwyn> so they get to make money thanks to infrastructure which is maintained by the state
[20:14:00] <selwyn> gilberth: not any more
[20:14:26] <gilberth> Good.
[20:15:43] <gilberth> Here trains stop service whenever there is a bit of wind, because trees keep falling onto the tracks. The train company just doesn't cut those back routinely anymore.
[20:15:54] <selwyn> after they had privatised it, there were some changes in safety procedures that were implicated in some big accidents
[20:16:21] <gilberth> Really? That's bad, very bad.

[20:21:16] <gilberth> The tracks being state owned while the transport service is private, is fine with me. It's like roads, which everyone may use.
[20:21:20] <selwyn> imo the gov of the time was somewhat forced into it, it ran counter to their privatisation instincts
[20:22:23] <gilberth> It's sad, that it needed crashes to make them reconsider. And it must have been pretty expensive to buy the tracks back.
[20:22:40] <selwyn> i don´t think anything else would have got them to reconsider
[20:23:03] *** Joins: Posterdati (~posterdat@host-82-49-175-12.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[20:24:03] <selwyn> issue with train operating companies is that they are really very different from e.g. coach services
[20:24:44] <selwyn> they get a contract awarded by the government to run a bit of rail infrastructure for a period of around 5 years
[20:24:55] <selwyn> and they are all distinct, so they don´t compete with each other
[20:25:40] <selwyn> in practice, a train operating company can try to e.g. save money by cutting services and turn a profit that way, with few adverse consequences
[20:26:29] <gilberth> Yes, and you don't do long term investments, when you want to be profitable now and don't care, if you're tomorrow.
[20:27:16] <selwyn> other issue is that they cannot really invest in much anyway
[20:28:05] <selwyn> apart from improving their rolling stock
[20:28:12] <gilberth> It's a bit like here we have poor internet as the phone company sticks to its cooper lines instead of just bringing fiber to the home. This could long have been done. I mean in the mid-80s or so, the whole country got cable TV in a relatively short term. Why can't we do that with fiber?
[20:28:20] <selwyn> they certainly cannot build a new line lol
[20:28:47] <selwyn> i meant a new train line
[20:29:10] <gilberth> I wonder why that was possible in the early days of rails. Weren't the first train companies private?
[20:29:56] <selwyn> yes
[20:30:03] <selwyn> but they often lost money and went bankrupt
[20:30:29] <selwyn> or got acquired by some other company
[20:31:59] <gilberth> Oh. Another example: sea cables. They are also private. Just yesterday to shut my brain down, I saw a documentary about trans-atlantic cables. In the very early days, it said, a single word transmitted would be like todays $20 charged for it.
[20:32:27] <gilberth> watched, even. ;dammit
[20:33:22] <gilberth> Imagine that. You send a telegram "I love you, darling. Will be back soon." and it's $160.
[20:33:28] <MichaelRaskin> Sea cables are simpler because you don't need to find out ownership for a continuous strip of land
[20:35:17] <selwyn> unless they break :o
[20:35:28] <gilberth> Yes, but getting them onto the sea ground was a challange. The first attempts failed. And then, what I find very funny, they had trouble getting a signal through. Has nobody thought about the transmission properties beforehand? And then they fried one as they increased the power driven into it.
[20:35:33] <MichaelRaskin> You say like rail lines don't break!
[20:35:49] <selwyn> yes but harder to fix something on the sea bed
[20:36:48] <gilberth> I wonder how they figured out the spot the cable broke in early days.
[20:36:56] <selwyn> iirc the first oil pipelines were reconfigured undersea cables
[20:38:42] <gilberth> These days it's easy. My router at the evil house could tell measure the LAN cable and tell me within a metre or so, where it broke. You just send a pulse and measure the time until it comes back as it would reflect at the bad spot.
[20:40:22] <gilberth> I wish I had that in the days we still had coax cable for LAN at my company. Then I literally pinged and did a bisection search for the bad BNC connector.
[20:41:34] <gilberth> selwyn: How in hell do you get oil through a cooper cable?
[20:42:08] <selwyn> am reminded of that famous 500-mile email bug
[20:42:25] <gilberth> Heh, yes.
[20:43:20] <gilberth> We could also only print on odd date. Nobody figured out why until we replaced the olde Netware server.
[20:44:32] <selwyn> apparently it was only based on an undersea telegraph cable
[20:45:31] <gilberth> Still. How would you transform that into a pipeline?
