[04:44:43] <nvz> Ubuntu aimed to make something easier and more resembling a commercial OS
[04:45:11] <nvz> yes but most anything you read on ubuntu will apply to debian cause ubuntu is built on the foundation of debian's work

[06:41:18] <Gallomimia> yeah it's slightly different. enough to be very confusing to try and understand it in such context
[06:41:21] <nvz> the caching for speed thing isnt something I did
[06:41:27] <ayecee> pretty easy to keep up with the fact that raid is not related to cache.
[06:41:55] <Gallomimia> i had a raid5 made of some platter disks. long story short, one died and the other 2 are dying. i need to migrate it to a single platter
[06:41:57] <ayecee> and that not everything that has dm- in front of it is raid
[06:42:03] <nvz> I didnt say that
[06:42:05] <Gallomimia> but... the plan was to involve some SSD's as a cache for it
[06:42:15] <ayecee> nah, nothing so coherent
[06:42:17] <nvz> I said the device manager is a kernel abstraction USED by many things.. LVM, RAID, etc..
[06:42:18] <Gallomimia> dm-crypt for example. i had that involved too
[06:42:33] <nvz> its not specific to such things is my point
[06:42:37] <Gallomimia> device manager? i thought it stood for mapper
[06:42:42] <nvz> yeah mapper
[06:42:54] <Gallomimia> both kinda make sense

[06:44:37] <Gallomimia> it was an interesting system no doubt. fairly fast before i dropped the machine on my face from a high shelf
[06:44:39] <nvz> you need to be able to map the volume manager and the container
[06:44:45] <nvz> cause its all on the same physical volume
[06:44:52] <Gallomimia> when it worked, it worked right well
[06:44:56] <nvz> but its indecipherable nonsense without the abstraction
[06:45:08] <Gallomimia> when i had boot problems, i got into my elbows in technical jargon
[06:45:26] <nvz> yeah I for a long time avoided all those dm things.. crypt, lvm, raid, etc..
[06:45:34] <Gallomimia> the point i'm trying to make is, i never did get a cache thing implented or functioning

[08:36:27] <Dagmar> You need _two_ things happening at the same time before "synchronous" or "asynchronous" are going to have any meaning
[08:36:33] <sphertext> Dagmar https://stackoverflow.com/questions/748175/asynchronous-vs-synchronous-execution-what-is-the-main-difference
[08:36:55] <Dagmar> No.
[08:37:26] <Dagmar> Shell scripts, like pretty much all interpreted scripting languages, executes statements one at a time.
[08:37:48] <Dagmar> ...and before the pedants pipe up, no, coroutines do not usefully add to this
[08:38:29] <pnbeast> I wrote my own shell.  It runs half of each command, then looks to see if there's another one and runs half of it, until no commands are left, then it finishes the first one.
[08:38:46] <Dagmar> If you want a _relevant_ example of something executing asynchronously, _lots_ of things take steps to do their DNS lookup asynchronously
[08:39:28] <Dagmar> ...because calling for domain resolution basically takes control completely away from your code, and makes it impossible to do things like, _quit_ when it's told
[08:39:47] <Sauvin> I've never found a use case for a coroutine.
[08:40:07] <Dagmar> Neither have I.  Mainly I just fork for things liket hat

[09:22:15] <sphertext> cornduck the dt880 are open back, which results in a more natural sound
[09:22:18] <Dagmar> ...then it would at least be a simple operation to get it off and on

[10:08:11] <Dagmar> Google registered .foo because it was kitchy and they wanted to use it for their internal sites
[10:08:13] <rascul> cornduck why does it matter?

[10:08:32] <rascul> nothing to the left of the tld needs to make sense

[10:08:43] <Dagmar> Except _now_ Google Chrome knows .foo to be a domain which requires SSL for everything, from a known registrar
[10:08:52] <fossforus> you can edit /etc/hosts right now to do your own resolution to prove tlds have no technical meaning

[10:44:03] <Henry151> what's really handy is that when you nick-hilighted me on that message, it sent me an SMS, with the message, so now that example command which is  what i really needed, is saved in my sms history on my phone, so tomorrow or later tonight or whatever, when i'm ready to try it, i can find it

[10:46:32] <Henry151> but for whatever stupid reason start9 decided that they would expect their customers would be running windows machines and would want to back up to a windows shared folder

[23:49:52] <Gustavo6046> so files (and data blocks in general) are content-addressed – you refer to them by an identifier derived from their hash/content
[23:49:55] <Gustavo6046> so usually you cannot update ipfs references
[23:50:05] <Gustavo6046> BUT there is ipns, which lets you make a reference that you can update, by using a keypair (you sign and publish updates to a key signature/hash with the private key, and people verify it using the public key)
[23:50:12] <Gustavo6046> iirc the ipns's content address / hash is derived from the public key instead?
[23:50:12] <joo-_> well that sounds great, i also have a dream of a time where you do computers without computing... like You dont have to worry about space anymore
[23:50:26] <Gustavo6046> i think with ipfs you still have to worry about space lol

[23:50:41] <Gustavo6046> on the one hand, it does split files into chunks (so some redundancies it can catch onto)
[23:50:47] <Gustavo6046> on the other it doesn't support compression over the wire
[23:50:55] <Gustavo6046> i don't think it even supports compression locally! but i might be wrong about that
[23:51:03] *** Joins: ExeciN (~ExeciN@user/nicexe)
[23:51:18] <Gustavo6046> anyway it also behaves kind of like a better bittorrent, assuming many hosts have a file you want, and if only one does it can still distribute the transfer through other hosts

[23:52:48] <joo-_> that really touched my heart jjakob , i am sitting here making an operating system :D
[23:52:50] <Gustavo6046> an operating system cannot be a broad or vague description of how a program operates
[23:52:56] <Gustavo6046> it MUST be specific
[23:53:01] <jjakob> web browsers for example are all essentially OS's now

[23:53:48] <joo-_> what "normal people" would call an os, is probably like a desktop environment
[23:53:49] <jjakob> why not? how can they capture your microphone or webcam or mouse?
[23:53:52] <Gustavo6046> while they kinda do provide task scheduling through asynchronous javascript execution, it's really nothing at all like the Unix-like init task tree
[23:54:15] <jjakob> they go through your OS, but they replicate the features of your OS inside the program
[23:54:22] <Gustavo6046> joo-_, you mean untechnical people; normal people with technical knowledge would call an OS a low-level piece of software that bridges the gap between the application layer and the underlying hardware
[23:54:32] <jjakob> like windowing, process isolation (sandboxing), etc
[23:54:34] <Gustavo6046> jjakob, they don't replicate the features of your OS
[23:54:40] <Gustavo6046> capturing the microphone or webcam or mouse is an application layer thing, not an OS thing
[23:54:52] <Gustavo6046> processes have NOTHING to do with isolation lol
[23:54:58] <Gustavo6046> which is especially true in the days of real mode OSes like MS-DOS

[23:55:34] *** Quits: kix (~kix@185.76.176.192) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:55:36] <Gustavo6046> there's virtual memory isolation
[23:55:42] <Gustavo6046> but that's nothing to do with what browsers do
[23:55:50] <jjakob> whatever you use to isolate processes
[23:55:53] <Gustavo6046> they both share a similar reason (security) but have other unrelated reasons too
[23:56:02] <Gustavo6046> what I mean is that your comparison is very vague and, ultimately, unfruitful
[23:56:20] <Gustavo6046> browsers can talk to your hardware (mouses, microphone, etc) because, newsflash, they talk to the OS
[23:56:24] <jjakob> the analogy is isolationg browser tabs/windows which each also run its own programs (client-side scripting)
[23:56:27] <Gustavo6046> guess what, Audacity can talk to your microphone
[23:56:34] <Gustavo6046> guess what, every single GUI program in existence can talk to your mouse
[23:56:38] <Gustavo6046> does that mean every program is an OS?
[23:56:51] <Gustavo6046> isolating browser tabs/windows is just good design
[23:56:55] <Gustavo6046> or, design at all lol
[23:57:04] <jjakob> no, but they don't try to replace features that are and should be provided by the OS
[23:57:05] <Gustavo6046> almost every software will include some degree of compartmentalization

[23:57:21] <Gustavo6046> they don't replace features
[23:57:31] <Gustavo6046> browsers sometimes provide JavaScript code access to OS features
[23:57:36] <Gustavo6046> but that is nothing at all like if it were its own OS
[23:57:42] <jjakob> how do Chromebooks exist?
[23:57:45] *** Joins: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher)
[23:57:48] <Gustavo6046> Chromebooks aren't literally Chrome dude
[23:57:54] <Gustavo6046> it's just Google being fucky-wucky with branding
[23:58:03] <Gustavo6046> maybe they use Chromium as a graphical shell
[23:58:08] <joo-_> i have seen so many applications trying to solve all problems for one business... instead of focusing on a simple task like how we have many programs in gnu/linux to do a simple task well...
[23:58:09] <Gustavo6046> but the underlying OS isn't Chrome
[23:58:23] <Gustavo6046> I bet it's Linux with some (probably permissive licensed) stuff inbetween itself and the graphical shell
[23:58:24] <jjakob> the underlying OS doesn't matter
[23:58:25] <joo-_> so the programmers go insane with power and money and make their program do everything

[23:58:33] <Gustavo6046> jjakob, it does because it's the *only* OS
[23:58:47] <Gustavo6046> it's the only OS because it's the only software that can talk to your computer at the low level thata OS is supposed to
[23:58:56] <Gustavo6046> there are exceptions, like microkernels
[23:59:06] <jjakob> if the user is only allowed to interact with the graphical shell, he never interacts with the OS directly, it's just the middleman the user doesn't even know exists
[23:59:07] <Gustavo6046> joo-_, like Blender?
[23:59:13] <Gustavo6046> I think it's useful to have lots of things in one place
