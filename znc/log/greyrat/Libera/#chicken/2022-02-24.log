[00:05:27] <tzar_bomba> I assume you meant 116 instead of 166 -- no. I ran `csc ilists.scm` from ilists dir, but it complains about "(import): cannot import from undefined module" and points to "(import (only chicken ..." line. I'm using version 5.2; you think that could be the problem?
[00:05:46] <Bunny351> yes, 116, sorry
[00:06:05] <Bunny351> the code looks like it is for CHICKEN 4
[00:06:36] <Bunny351> .meta and .setup files indicate the same
[00:08:57] <tzar_bomba> I plan to make changes and do a pull request. Do you think I should refactor (whatever that entails) code to be runnable with 5? Or should I leave it as is and instead find and install version 4 chicken toolkit locally
[00:11:39] <Bunny351> If there is no port of this egg to CHICKEN 5, then doing so would be of some service. CHICKEN 4 is really out of date. Usually porting is not that hard.
[00:11:49] <Bunny351> we can help you with the effort, if you want.
[00:15:17] <klovett> C5 SRFI-116 has maintainer "Jeremy Steward"
[00:16:12] <tzar_bomba> it's not really about egg really, but the srfi itself which happened to decide to use chicken for testing
[00:17:41] <Bunny351> tzar_bomba: "chicken-install -r srfi-116"
[00:18:40] <Bunny351> this gives you the code for the egg, and the test suite

[01:16:07] <siiky> completely OT, but anyone else here use Debian Testing? did you notice that you can't access other PCs on the local network by name? sometime in the last ~2 weeks
[01:29:30] <DeeEff_> Is 116 not C5 yet?
[01:29:57] <DeeEff_> I thought I had already ported it but I guess not. 
[01:30:38] <DeeEff_> Huh it looks like it has an egg file 
[01:30:57] <DeeEff_> Is it broken? I haven't seen anything on bugs.call-cc.org 
[01:33:17] <DeeEff_> tzar_bomba: if you want to submit a PR please use https://github.com/ThatGeoGuy/srfi-116
[01:51:05] <tzar_bomba> my concern is to fix the reference srfi implementation, not the egg. Specifically, missing comparator procedures. I see the above is a fork with extra fork. Perhaps I should ask Jeremy to make an upstream pull request, and go from there

[02:40:32] <tzar_bomba> yeah code differences; particularly refactoring for it to work on chicken 5
[02:41:05] <tzar_bomba> by it I mean tests, mostly
[02:54:30] <zilti[m]> I'm trying to create a lexer with silex. Now I've run into an issue... silex claims for this: `[\0080-\D7FF]` "bad range specification in character class; the start character is higher than the end one." Even though it is clear as day that that is not the case.
[02:54:42] <zilti[m]> Does someone have an idea what to do about this?
[03:14:55] <Zipheir> zilti[m]: Unfortunately, silex has bugs and is very complicated and mostly undocumented.
[03:15:41] <zilti[m]> Aw, that's unfortunate :/
[03:16:52] <Zipheir> The procedure throwing that is parse-class-range, FWIW.
[03:17:56] <Zipheir> The test is just (> c c2), where c is the range start and c2 the end.  So it must be the representation?
[03:18:50] <Zipheir> Presumably it doesn't like \NNNN ?
[03:19:06] <Bunny351> or sign trouble?

[22:35:36] <elflng> you know the theory of free riders?
[22:36:11] <elflng> basically, the end point of free riders, to avoid detection, is that they have to fake not being free riders so well that they actually effectively stop being free riders.
[22:36:43] <elflng> similar to spam detection - eventually, in order to avoid detection, spam will have to fake being real so well as to actually be useful information.

[23:10:29] <zilti[m]> Well tbf I already had spam like that. One mail had nothing but a what I assume is a quote from a book. Another told me it's dangerous to use q-tips to clean my ears. And yet another suggested that the knives I own may decide over success or not of my dinner dates. I mean... Not terribly useful info, especially the last one since I don't plan on murdering anyone, but still
