[02:28:38] <sm> hey all. How do you install tui and gui emacs at the same time with homebrew ? I believe `emacs` is tui and `homebrew/cask/emacs` is gui, and they both want to install /opt/homebrew/bin/emacs.
[02:29:25] <sm> tar_xvf: I don't use it but did once try it on gnu/linux, and I mention it on my install page as another install option since it may package more things and much more recent things than the distro package manager
[02:29:44] <sm> also, doesn't require root access IIRC
[02:47:09] <sm> I had to `brew unlink emacs`, `brew install homebrew/cask/emacs`, manually rename /opt/homebrew/bin/emacs*, `brew link --overwrite emacs`
[02:50:14] <sm> oh oh, I spoke too soon. The homebrew/cask/emacs seems to be unusable on latest macos ("Cannot check for malicious software"). Avoid that one I guess.
