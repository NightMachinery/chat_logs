[05:25:47] <Samian> Have you ever found a subject that had a reputation of being "hard" only to realize that it appears hard not because there are many ideas but only because the ideas are poorly explained?
[05:26:04] <Samian> that happens to me
[05:27:31] <Samian> and then I get suspicious of fraud and sneaky trickery by people who I suspect may be pretentious pompouses obfuscating and equivocating intentionally!
[05:28:17] <voltage_> could you explain it better?
[05:28:22] <Samian> I experienced this today infact, studying neural networks for "Natural language processing"
[05:28:33] <Samian> voltage_:  yes, much much better, with fewer words
[05:28:49] <voltage_> ok try it
[05:29:13] <Samian> What are you asking me to try to do?
[05:29:19] *** Quits: Henry151 (~bishop@ns3007530.ip-151-80-44.eu) (Changing host)

[05:29:21] <voltage_> try explaining it
[05:29:55] <Samian> okay I will
[05:30:15] <Samian> watch and learn how efficient transfer of knowledge happens
[05:30:47] <Samian> What I'll explain in this crash course is how neural networks are used to solve language problems
[05:31:51] <Samian> Example problems:  A program where you give it a word, and the program gives back a list of words with associated "how-similar-is-the-word" values
[05:32:38] <Samian> Another problem:   A program where you give it 10 words of a passage, and the program gives back the word it predicts is the next word
[05:33:49] <Samian> Another:  A program where you give it a paragraph, and the program gives back a single word that signifies the subject of the paragraph. If you gave the program a paragraph about history, the program would return the word "history"
[05:34:15] <Samian> now we have an idea of what we're trying to accomplish
[05:34:46] <audrey> I don't get this?
[05:35:05] <audrey> Some subjects are hard because they require knowledge of technical vocabulary, technical concepts, how those concepts all fit together, etc.
[05:35:24] <audrey> The explanation doesn't always involve "LOL some guy who's full of it"
[05:35:55] * Samian puts the crash course on pause to address audrey.
[05:36:24] <Samian> audrey: "technical vocabulary, technical concepts, how those concepts all fit together" === "prerequisite knowledge"
[05:36:48] <Samian> yes, some things are hard because understanding the ideas require a lot of prerequisite knowledge.
[05:37:23] <Samian> But I often see ideas that do not require prerequisite knowledge poorly explained
[05:37:56] <Samian> the poor explanations are 90% of the time caused by equivocations
[05:38:31] <Samian> “Word embedding creates word embeddings from words.”
[05:38:34] <audrey> What specific context are you referring to?
[05:38:48] <audrey> i.e., what specific field or subfield are you trying to learn, where you have been faced by this problem
[05:38:53] <audrey> and what resources have you been using to learn it
[05:38:53] <Samian> that sentence contains two different ways people use the term "word embedding"
[05:39:42] <Samian> “The word embedding (algo) creates a word embedding (vector)"
[05:40:44] <audrey> I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.
[05:41:15] <Samian> ah don't worry about it. I'm just venting. It's. a weakness I'm working on. I need to stop venting
[05:41:32] <Samian> I do this too often. Every day this past week I've joined an irc channel just to vent
[05:42:25] <Samian> venting about poor code I review, dumb stuff I saw in the news,  over terminology in an AI book, etc
[05:42:34] <audrey> You can't let it get to you.
[05:42:44] <audrey> That's someone else's problem, not your problem.
[05:42:56] <Samian> audrey:  you may not know the subject, but you do see that I'm venting because I thought something could have been better explained
[05:43:40] <audrey> Yes. I fail to see how that's your problem.
[05:43:47] <audrey> That's on the person who is giving the poor explanation.
[05:43:50] <Samian> wtf am I doing. I must go through life *expecting* to come across poor communication.  If I expect good communication, and become upset at poor communication, I'm asking to be miserable my entire life!!!
[05:44:16] <audrey> Well, I'd say you're miserable right now because you're getting way too upset over trivialities and things that are outside your control.
[05:44:28] <Parf> just read the masters, like i do. no need to edit anything anyone says there
[05:44:28] <audrey> It doesn't pay to be this high strung. Trust me. I was that way for years.
[05:44:49] <Samian> audrey:  it was my probem because I need to learn the material for my job and learning took way more time than it needed to.  After hours of studying, I say "oh it's just that? You could have told me that in 10 minutes"
[05:44:58] <Parf> venting is best done with a fist and something that is not alive but will not destroy said fist
[05:45:37] <Samian> Parf:  good idea. It's not cool for me to waste other people's time venting
[05:45:48] <Samian> I apologize
[05:45:59] <audrey> Samian: And your getting extra upset helps solve the problem how?
[05:46:07] <audrey> Venting is fine, if you think you can achieve something with it.
[05:46:18] <audrey> If not, it's just impotent anger, and there's nothing sadder than impotent anger.
[05:46:24] <audrey> Trying to defuse the situation here, is all.
[05:46:25] <Samian> it doesn't. Becoming upset just makes me more inefficient, and I waste time venting instead of advancing onward
[05:46:31] <audrey> Maybe I'm doing a bad job of it. :D
[05:46:52] <Samian> it doesn't *help solve the problem
[05:47:08] <Parf> i am an emotional thinker as well, samian, it takes a lot of self discipline not to grow furious, and you're right, it doesn't always help when you do
[05:47:20] <Parf> i try to make those same energies manifest in creative ways, now
[05:47:50] <Parf> like letting a light come out with an angle that makes it blue instead of red
[05:47:54] <Samian> I need to be like Yoda in the scene where he sucks light-force into the palm of his hand and makes it disappear
[05:48:45] <audrey> I think it's a great life skill to know how to keep your cool.

[05:52:14] <Samian> I need to be like that!
[05:53:10] <Parf> i think it's also a great thing to be brave enough to be angry when you should. too many are so clipped they'd not blink if their families were murdered
[05:54:50] <audrey> Anger is not a very productive emotion, is kind of the problem.
[05:55:04] <audrey> It's also an incredibly enticing emotion.
[05:55:37] <audrey> Anger and libido are pretty unproductive, as far as problem-solving skills go.
[05:55:43] <audrey> The id, in Freudian terms.
[05:56:00] <audrey> I think a good life is a life where the id is kept firmly under control.
[05:56:16] <audrey> It's exhausting when it isn't.
[05:56:48] *** Quits: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse) (Quit: pulse)
[05:58:20] <Parf> i don't like freud's terms at all really
[05:58:38] <Parf> i use my own bullshit to describe those separate tiers, but yeah, anger is useful as hell
[05:58:40] <Parf> if you know how to use it
[05:58:51] <Parf> though, my favorite emotional energy is sorrow
[05:59:23] <Parf> well, not even, it's more the actual act of weeping itself.
[05:59:55] <audrey> I mean, insofar as it's a motivator to do things, yes
[06:00:08] <audrey> The problem is that it leads easily to a kind of vicious cycle
[06:00:41] <Parf> no question, one must know the time and place. discipline is important, but killing it off is entirely unhealthy. people should be able to feel angry or sad, or whatever.
[06:00:55] <Parf> whether or not they allow them to control themselves, is really where the bottleneck is there
[06:01:23] <audrey> I'm not sure I can agree. I've spent much of my adult life with anger issues and now that I've dulled anger down to a nub, I think I am much the better for it.
[06:01:40] <Samian> audrey:  thank you for your golden wisdom!
[06:01:49] <Parf> well, yet again, we stand on two sides of a coin, audrey
[06:01:56] <Samian> I never heard the term "id" before either.
[06:01:58] <audrey> Samian: I'm not wise, LOL. Quite the opposite.
[06:02:12] <audrey> "Oh mother, tell your children / Not to do what I have done!" - House of the Rising Sun
[06:02:18] <Samian> audrey: wise or not, the ideas you expressed I very much like
[06:02:36] <Parf> i knew a one eyed old man who sang that all night
[06:02:38] <Samian> The quality of ideas don't depend on who says the ideas.
[06:02:51] <Parf> his name was one eyed mike, but his real name wasn't mike
[06:02:59] <Samian> "a good life is a life where the id is kept firmly under control."
[06:03:16] <audrey> Perhaps it's a YMMV situation. For me, my life is much better without the experience of anger, and more generally with the taming of the id.
[06:03:39] <audrey> I'm a fairly contemplative person at heart, once I weed out all the bad mental habits I've accrued over the years.

[06:07:23] <Parf> well, i wouldn't want to convince you of my philosophy at this point, of what i know, i feel that my life wouldn't be amenable to most people, but i think in particular, how you might see yourself were you standing a day as me, you would not be a happy or even sane person. really, i don't think many people could ride this wild dragon, frankly. that's not braggadocio, just that i barely can control it even with all that sort of sedulous order, and i think i
[06:07:23] <Parf> would be less happy, sane, were i to structure anything within me
[06:07:36] <Parf> you ever heard that song, even flow?

[19:31:09] <newB> I sometimes drink milk
[19:31:11] <arryana> i drink tea, sparkling water, and port.  on a rare occasion in winter i will have rum in hot milk

[20:58:17] <lalia> Foucault keeps coming up in my philosophy social circles recently. An amusing resurgence of popularity seemingly out of nowhere.
[20:58:27] <pussipupu> Is entomology on-topic? https://mobile.twitter.com/thegallowboob/status/1404232183561080835 :3
[20:58:28] <lalia> And from diverse interest groups too.
[20:58:52] <lalia> Ha! That's absurdly cute. :3
[20:59:02] <pussipupu> I keep seeing Foucault invoked as a bogeyman
[20:59:23] <pussipupu> Makes me wonder if I should read some...
[21:00:30] <lalia> My take on the "on-topic" part of philosophy discussion is quite flexible and relies pretty heavily on whether or not a discussion appears to be proceeding charitably/constructively.
[21:01:06] <lalia> And WRT Foucault: I've always enjoyed his later work in terms of his commentary on structures of power and his take on sexuality.
[21:01:33] <lalia> Though the latter comes with a few caveats... like the details surrounding his death.
[21:02:06] <lalia> He appears to have concealed his illness for some time and it may have been a health risk for some of the people he was with at the time.
[21:02:14] <lalia> Interesting and sad story.
[21:04:08] <lalia> Foucault's critique of Bentham's vision of education as it relates to the instutitonal development of schooling is good shit.
[21:04:37] <lalia> He saw the panopticon more clearly for its flaws than anyone before him, from what I've understood.
[21:04:58] <lalia> Cool work. :) Alright, time for something caffinated.
[21:07:33] <pussipupu> Everything comes with caveats to be fair :p
