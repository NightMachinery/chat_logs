[09:44:53] <libniwtr> Hi, all! I would like to start my adventure on lisp game programming. I have a Lispworks 8.0 license which I want to exploit but I'm not sure which graphics library runs great on this platform, maybe cl-opengl? cl-sdl2? Any suggestions?
[10:01:32] <|3b|> cl-opengl is probably most popular choice for actually rendering graphics, and should work (please file bugs if it doesn't, so we can try to fix it at some point). you will still need something to deal with window creation, input etc. cl-sdl2 seems like a popular choice for that these days, no idea how well that runs (or if it is expected to) on lw
[10:04:21] <libniwtr> Thank you for your explanation! I thought picking up one of them, but now I guess I'd take them both.

[10:06:00] <ln43> Hi all
[10:12:50] <libniwtr> As for cl-opengl, where could I find the documentations? I didn't find any docs/tutorials on the Github page, nor the common-lisp.net page.
[10:13:59] <|3b|> nowhere :/ it works pretty much like C opengl though, so most of the tutorials for that can be adapted fairly easily (lots of people here can help with any of the parts that aren't obvious)
[10:16:03] <|3b|> ('easily' once you get used to it at least)
[10:16:09] <libniwtr> Ok, then I should grab a textbook about opengl and start grinding:) Â But which version should I pick up? Is cl-opengl bound to OpenGL 3 or 2?
[10:17:00] <|3b|> cl-opengl is split into 2 parts, low-level bindings in the %gl package are generated directly from the GL spec, so cover pretty much everything, including extensions and opengl es
[10:18:00] <|3b|> the high-level part in the GL: package is generally nicer to use, but also has some parts that are very old. It can still be used with gl 2.1 or 4.6 or whatever version you want for the most part though
[10:18:28] <|3b|> you just might need to poke into %gl for some things involving buffers once in a while when using more modern APIs
[10:18:35] <|3b|> more modern usage of the API
[10:19:31] <libniwtr> Nice, very useful explanation. Thanks. I'll look into both the packages later.
[10:19:39] <|3b|> https://github.com/3b/learnopengl is an attempt at converting a popular and relatively modern gl tutorial site into CL with cl-opengl, which might help get started
[10:22:50] <libniwtr> That's a good one. Another stupid newbie question: is opengl suitable for a simple 2d game? The opengl is more of a 3d graphics library in my cognition.
[10:23:40] <libniwtr> Please correct me if I'm wrong:)
[10:23:55] <|3b|> seems like most things do 2d with 3d APIs these days
[10:24:29] <|3b|> and there isn't any particularly good "2d game graphics" API in CL that i know of, so opengl is the best i can suggest at this point
[10:25:20] <libniwtr> Fine, I'll stick to cl-opengl and cl-sdl2 then.
[10:25:52] * |3b| expects if there were a 2d game lib in CL, it would probably be implemented with GL as the backend anyway
[10:32:15] <|3b|> also, if you stay around long enough, other people might have other suggestions, and/or more concrete knowledge of cl-sdl2 and alternatives
[10:34:41] <libniwtr> I'm completely new to game programming and I think opengl is the best for start-up. Things learned in cl-opengl can be easily transferred to C/C++, if I ever planned to change the language in the future.

[11:19:21] <ln43> Once you have a gameloop the choice of the language is based on productivity only
[11:19:57] <ln43> for sure CL is more convenient for the purpose
[11:20:17] <ln43> doe example right now i'm in a loop with the bootloader : /
[11:20:52] <ln43> basically it doesn't recognize the initramfs file format

[19:52:56] <artchad> Honestly, I think it's best to learn glut as a tool kit for OpenGL first. 
[19:53:51] <artchad> SDL2 need to come later... I'm wondering what the benefits of using SDL2 are. It has many advanced features like controller support and stuff, but I think I don't need that for my purposs. Using GLUT might be the smarter choice for now.
[19:58:50] <borodust> it sure be easier
