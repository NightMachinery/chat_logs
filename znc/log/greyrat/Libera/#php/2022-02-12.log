[04:27:02] <Sammitch> MrBurns: though it's worth noting that targeting an image resize to a number of bytes is not something that can be reasonably accomplished without a fair bit of trial and error. modern image formats are compressed, and a 100x100 all black image is going to have a significant differnce in size to a 100x100 image of random color noise.
[04:29:17] <MrBurns> Sammitch: you are correct. resizing the resolution seems to be the better option
[04:30:10] <Sammitch> but also storing images in a SQL databse is usually a bad idea. put it on a disk or in an object store and store the _path_ in the db
[04:32:06] <MrBurns> Sammitch: yes this is also true but this is somewhat special case where only couble of images will be stored and the whole database will need to be cloned with the images
[04:36:02] <lembron> its an odd thing todo, but not "terrible" ye.. especially when fairly limited in size
[04:39:06] <lembron> and "resizing the resolution seems to be the better option" -- as i understood that was your plan from the getgo -- that said, there are "better" external tools for doing things like lossless improvements "depending on image-format" like optipng
[04:42:13] <MrBurns> lembron: What kind of img format limits should I use? and could you pass me to the right tutorial/manual on resizin with php?
[04:46:12] <MrBurns> For some reason I thought that I could have just done some sqlimg = resize(myimg, maxkb=20) :P
[04:51:52] <Blondie101010> that's a tricky suggestion...  resizing images is a common cause of web server crashes, intentional or not

[05:47:10] <__adrian> like, way easier
[05:47:28] <TML> Albright: The alternative is just to make a PHP page somewhere under the docroot and write your logic directly in PHP.
[05:47:41] * Blondie101010 nods
[05:47:45] <__adrian> what i was wondering about was more like whether you had any technical/design/whatever reasons to not want to inntegrate
[05:47:47] <Albright> In Drupal that would be a mortal sin

[05:48:25] <TML> You don't HAVE to take advantage of the framework just because it's there
[05:49:22] <Albright> I don't need any content from the WP database or anything, so yeah, I guess I'll just write a stand-alone PHP script.
[05:50:00] <__adrian> sure - i was kinda assuming that you actually need wp or some functionality it provides
[05:50:03] <Albright> That's just really different from any other framework I've worked with in memory though.
[05:50:07] <__adrian> but if not, then just don't
[05:50:10] <Blondie101010> if you want it include inside the WP site, you could iframe or similar

[06:26:51] <__adrian> as generic advice, don't roll your own when a good tool alreday exists.
[06:27:10] <Blondie101010> your question is too broad and off topic
[06:27:12] <omegatron> but finding a good tool as of today is very difficult
[06:27:18] <__adrian> slightly more specific advice, don't roll your own payments
[06:27:32] <__adrian> omegatron: it's easier than ever.
[06:27:34] <omegatron> 1) there are many  2) many are mediocre at best  3) insert something here

[06:28:30] <__adrian> good call
[06:28:33] <relipse> But I meant should I use latest Paracelsus
[06:28:44] <relipse> Laravel
[06:29:03] <relipse> Silly autocorrect
[06:29:12] <__adrian> if your question is "should i use laravel or wordpress or {whatever}," that's really not relevant.
[06:29:23] <Blondie101010> still quite off topic, !+frameworks
[06:29:23] <php-bot> still quite off topic, Arguments about frameworks are not a valid topic for ##php; if your question is re:a specific framework, you may want to try them in their own support channel: Zend Framework: #zftalk; Drupal: #drupal-support; Symfony: #symfony; SilverStripe: #silverstripe; CodeIgniter: #codeigniter; Laravel: #laravel; and so on.
[06:29:23] <relipse> Or just do my own thing
[06:29:35] <__adrian> see generic advice above
[06:30:07] <relipse> Do you use frameworks?
[06:30:12] <Blondie101010> relipse:  realistically, people who build applications or websites without a framework already have a suitable library or tool to do it
[06:30:13] <__adrian> but trying to chosoe a framework based on the fact that you need (e.g.) a photo gallery, is nonsense.
[06:30:35] <__adrian> do i use frameworks? see generic advice above.
[06:30:42] <Blondie101010> if you have nothing, you can either spend a few years making your own, and then doing the work, or use an existing framework
[06:31:02] <relipse> I can roll my own solution
[06:31:07] <Blondie101010> as usually, I slightly exaggerate
[06:31:22] <__adrian> you missed a step ;) after you spend a few years making your own and then doing work, you're going to have to spend a few years to redesign it.
[06:31:24] <Blondie101010> relipse:  your choice
[06:31:30] <relipse> Or I can jump on the laravel bandwagon
[06:31:55] <__adrian> and then a few years to realize you shouldn't have done it yourself without first looking at existing tools  ;)
[06:32:10] <Blondie101010> definitely the norm
[06:32:20] <__adrian> don't jump on bandwagons. consider things and make decisions.
[06:32:26] <relipse> Well laravel code goes out of date and needs to be upgraded
[06:32:57] <relipse> And those upgrades can be more trouble than I want
[06:33:03] <Blondie101010> everything needs to be maintained, so the more things you have to build yourself, the more effort it will involve over time
[06:33:06] <__adrian> ^
[06:33:36] <relipse> Itâ€™s easier to upgrade and maintain code I built myself
[06:33:40] <__adrian> no, it's not.
[06:34:05] <__adrian> not compared to something actively maintained and widely used, with a good upgrade process, anyway.
[06:34:16] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, do you want to document your work as well with examples and copy-paste-ready-to-observe code examples?
[06:35:13] <relipse> I think the code I write is easy to maintain
[06:35:31] <__adrian> do what you want  ;)
[06:35:44] <__adrian> we're giving advice, not trying to talk you into anything.
[06:36:24] <BadAdviceCat> The point I want to make is that, if a nice tool exist, and there are nice docs for it, you should consider using that option. Especially if other people will be involved in maintaining the software. Usually, building from scratch involves understanding how alternative software already works, AND that the existing alternatives doesn't solve the problem well.
[06:37:18] <BadAdviceCat> At least, that is how I am motivated in writing my own wheel, but if that's what you want to do anyway, then fine.
[06:37:27] <Blondie101010> that is the logical approach
[06:38:34] <Blondie101010> but all new programmers think they can make miracles in no time if they build everything, and then they spend months and months and months doing NOTHING other than fixing and improving that
[06:38:57] <Blondie101010> plan well and realistically

[22:35:31] <nkm> Hi. i need little suggestion/help
[22:35:53] <nkm> i am working on a video sharing website.
[22:36:11] <nkm> i need to save video with multiple categories (checkboxes)
[22:36:21] <nkm> in which type should i save my categoires in DB. as a string or as an array?
[22:36:30] <nkm> on the frontend video view page i need to show the related categories videos too on side
[22:36:47] <nkm> i will link my video table category_id field to Category table
[22:37:01] <nkm> so in which format should i save my categories (multiple checkboxes data) inside category_id (it can be multiple)
[22:37:09] <Albright> nkm: Okay, so you have a table of videos
[22:37:16] <Albright> And they are identified by video_id
[22:37:21] <nkm> Albright.yes
[22:37:28] <nkm> thanks for your response
[22:37:32] <Albright> And you have a table of categories and they are identified by category_id
[22:37:52] <nkm> Video table has primary key 'video_id'
[22:38:00] <Albright> And then you have a third table of video_categories with two columns; video_id and category_id
[22:38:01] <nkm> also video table has category_id ffield
[22:38:08] <AllenJB> I would use a separate link table to link videos to categories. If you try to use a single field, selecting videos based on category will be both difficult and slow.
[22:38:38] <nkm> i don't have 3rd table right now
[22:38:45] <Albright> So create it. :)
[22:38:46] <nkm> just two tables. video ad category
[22:39:16] <nkm> okay
[22:39:46] <Albright> When you create a video, you create one row in the video_category table. Each has the same video_id value but different category_id values corresponding to each category it is "tagged" with.
[22:39:54] <Blondie101010> that is required to handle many-to-many relationships
[22:40:20] <Albright> When updating a video, the easiest way to update that data is to just delete every row in video_category with the corresponding video_id and then re-insert new rows corresponding to the new categories.
[22:40:57] <nkm> okay.
[22:41:02] <Albright> You can get fancy and only delete or insert rows for the categories that have changed but if you're not updating videos very often you can get away with not doing that level of optimization.
[22:41:11] <Albright> Do you know how to write SQL join queries?
[22:41:55] <nkm> well i just want to ask. if I save the categories as a string or array inside video table category_id field.
[22:42:54] <Albright> You can get away with that, but you can't practically do join queries when values are stored that way, nor can you easily do a query like "show all videos in category X" or even "show all videos in category X and Y but not Z."
[22:42:56] <Blondie101010> it's not practical, efficient, or well designed
[22:43:32] <nkm> okay.
[22:43:48] <nkm> so create a 3rd table to save video_id and category_id.
