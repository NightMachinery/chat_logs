[00:00:13] <leah> i said: replace 120ohm with 470ohm on the sync lines. hsync and vsync each have 120ohm series
[00:00:19] <leah> why do i know 470 is more correct?
[00:00:41] <leah> because i wrote this app (AGPLv3 btw) which tells me. see these results:
[00:00:51] <leah> https://minifree.org/resistordivider/app.php?vin=3300&vtarget=450&rtarget=&tolerance=0.1%25&e=24&order=ascending#computations
[00:01:12] <leah> your monitor has 75ohm terminations (resistors to ground). and those 120ohms are just series from 3.3v source
[00:01:26] <leah> look at that page, on the R2 column, for result where R2 is 75ohm
[00:01:55] <leah> about 450mV is "correct" for 75 ohm level sync voltage
[00:02:18] <leah> i know that because i've studied analog video stuff. and vga666 adapter is crazily out of spec ;)

[00:04:58] <leah> i should probably contact the people making/selling vga666 adapters to warn them about that
[00:05:27] <leah> the adapter: https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/gert-vga-666-hardware-vga-raspberry-pi
[00:06:27] <leah> the schematic is on page 4: https://github.com/fenlogic/vga666/blob/master/documents/vga_manual.pdf
[00:07:42] <leah> and these are the resistors: http://raspi.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/VGA666-cropped_1500.jpg
[00:08:08] <leah> should be easy for most people to change them because they're tht

[00:20:49] <leah> btw
[00:21:02] <leah> the actual tolerance is 300-600mV for sync
[00:22:09] <leah> so i'd say 330-560ohm is fine. 470ohm is just a common value that in this case happens to get you slap bang in the middle
[00:23:23] <leah> river: sync is 3.3v but on vga666 adapter for rpi, goes through 120ohm. that combined with 75ohm to ground in your monitor, causes a "resistor divider". we'll call the 120ohm r1 and the 75ohm r2
[00:23:37] <leah> vout = (vin * r2) / (r1 + r2)
[00:24:03] <leah> vin is 3300mV. and you want between 300-600 on vout for sync going in to your monitor. do the math with these numbers
[00:24:29] <leah> if you just use the vga666 adapter unmodified though, it shouldn't blow up your monitor straight away. but it might cause damage over time
[00:24:53] <leah> but right now, hdmi isn't working on librerpi. so you have to use analog rgb on that adapter. i really need to get in touch with the people selling it
[00:25:03] <leah> clever showed me the schematic when i was bored and it's the first thing i noticed
[00:26:07] <leah> i've been obsessing over how best to modify the adapter, not just for this but... what if i crammed a bunch more resistors on it to get full 24-bit rgb
[00:26:25] <leah> i'll just go buy one and play with it instead of talk here

[05:11:54] <tpefreedom> DiffieHellman, can online games be truly freedom respecting?
[05:19:07] <isf> ofcourse can tpefreedom
[05:19:30] <isf> see minetest online servers
[05:19:47] <tpefreedom> But then why can't a MOBA (DoTA/League of Legends style games)?
[05:20:52] <isf> becouse the devs of games in computing dont respect the users freedoms 
[05:20:58] <isf> normaly
[05:21:10] <isf> normaly always they attack the user freedoms
[05:21:32] <isf> becouse that is the easy way to them to have a little monopoly
[05:21:37] <tpefreedom> but we could create a free software one, right?
[05:21:45] <isf> ofcourse
[05:21:59] <Noisytoot> tpefreedom: A compatible replacement would still use the nonfree server
[05:22:16] <isf> with free software and with images art, music without DRM
[05:22:29] <tpefreedom> It does not have to compatible. It just has to be similar
[05:22:40] <tpefreedom> like how minetest (w/ mineclone2) is to minecraft
[05:22:51] <tpefreedom> or what STK is to Mario Kart

[05:45:32] <isf> i dont know if from that info you can do something what respect the users freedoms
[05:45:44] <qrpnxz> Noisytoot: it doesn't make any sense to say non-free server (or to complain that the server is non-free) because you never receive a copy of the server program, so the four freedoms don't apply at all. And even if you did receive a copy, that program is not necessarily a SaaSS. Even Stallman has written about this https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/network-services-arent-free-or-nonfree.html

[06:51:34] <leah> or just do yet another testing release in May
[06:51:58] <leah> (both 2021 libreboot releases are testing releases, not stable releases, and sure enough, both have some bugs in them)
[06:52:18] <leah> coincidentally, libreboot is pretty much stable now on most boards, if you want libreboot. but build it from source, don't use the 2021 releases

[14:35:05] <DiffieHellman> A bunch of companies have patented their RISC-V extensions.
[14:35:56] <fossdev2> oh

[14:38:07] <damo22> DiffieHellman: "open source" is not proprietary, its just missing the point of why you have freedom in your software
[14:39:13] <DiffieHellman> The "open source definition" meets the free software definition as well, but lots of people love calling proprietary software "open source", plus people who love calling free software "open source" generally accept proprietary software with open arms.
[14:40:16] <damo22> if they call proprietary software open source, they are wrong
[14:41:22] <damo22> no proprietary program can be open source (?)
[14:41:36] <DiffieHellman> Proprietary programs can be source available under NDA :3
[14:41:53] <damo22> ok
[14:42:04] <damo22> but then its not really open source to the public
[14:42:22] <DiffieHellman> "open source" means either source availble or the "open source definion" and most people thing it's the former.
[14:42:28] <damo22> and definitely not free software
[14:42:38] <DiffieHellman> *think
[14:43:33] <damo22> source is always available, unless the developer has lost it
[14:43:56] <damo22> under that definitiion
[14:46:04] <fossdev2> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_hardware?wprov=sfla1
[14:46:20] <damo22> therefore "open source" is an oxymoron 
[14:46:32] <fossdev2> but they list some hardware
[14:46:49] <DiffieHellman> Hardware cannot be "open source", as you can't throw that hardware though a copier and have an exact copy - you need to manufacture it.

[14:47:12] <DiffieHellman> Most of what wikipedia lists is probably free hardware designs.
[14:47:32] <damo22> wait, every program is open source then...
[14:47:51] <damo22> but you might not be able to get the source code unless the developer wants you to
[14:49:55] <damo22> so open source is a tautology
[14:50:06] <fossdev2> but why no one manufacture them if they are free
[14:50:24] <damo22> its like describing a program as source available, given some restriction
[14:50:38] <DiffieHellman> Since manufacturing hardware costs money unlike copying bits, which costs 0.00001 cents of electricity

[21:13:33] <GNUtoo> hi,
[21:13:45] <GNUtoo> There is a link to a tarball in this page: https://www.gnu.org/help/gnu-bucks.html
[21:14:03] <GNUtoo> What is the license of the files inside that tarball?
[21:14:10] <scara> Hmm today I learned: https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/GNU/Linux#GNU.2FLinux_naming_controversy

[21:14:23] <GNUtoo> There are 2 png and 2 xcf, so it looks like it's meant for modification
[21:14:49] <GNUtoo> But the FSF website license prevents modification, so it is probably under another license but I don't know which one
[21:15:34] <GNUtoo> scara: there is also the fact that Android uses Linux, so using GNU/Linux also makes everything more clear
[21:15:51] *** Joins: RedSoxFan07 (~Thunderbi@d-159-250-218-50.ct.cpe.atlanticbb.net)
[21:16:18] <scara> Does android use GNU though? Thought it was basicly just a java runtime app.
[21:16:35] <GNUtoo> not really, I didn't find any GNU in the resulting images
[21:16:42] <kompowiec2> same alpine linux
[21:16:47] <GNUtoo> the libc is custom for instance, it's based on some BSD libc
[21:16:59] <GNUtoo> the alsa library is custom too, the shell utilities are custom too

[21:18:59] <GNUtoo> There are very few things shared with GNU/Linux, and they all don't come from GNU AFAIK, you have things like wpa_supplicant, there is also MESA, and that's probably all
[21:19:19] *** Joins: utis (~utis@84.208.160.26)
[21:20:14] <GNUtoo> There might still be things like bzip2 and gcc in the build system though
[21:20:25] <scara> Idea: remove the word linux from distros names and just call it something else in it self like ubuntu or arch not linux mint.
[21:20:43] <scara> gentoo?
[21:20:51] *** Joins: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34)
[21:21:16] <GNUtoo> It also works but then what is Gentoo? I'd say it's a GNU/Linux distribution, though it can probably run on top of other OSes too
[21:21:29] <kompowiec2> freeplane rebel against me, in 461 nodes it stop exporting to XML, only SVG, PNG I have to convert manually from SVG.
[21:22:47] <GNUtoo> (it's not an Android distribution at least)
[21:24:23] <scara> Its a distribution of alot of software, not just gnu or linux.
[21:25:23] <craigt> GNUtoo: Good question. I wasn't able to quickly find an answer to the GNU Buck licensing. Can you please email licensing@fsf.org with the question?
[21:25:44] <GNUtoo> Thanks

[22:50:37] <leah> qrpnxz: no idea about coreboot, i think they probably still have non-free init (probably some ami thing. aptio
[22:50:43] <leah> qrpnxz: i know they have free ec firmware
[22:50:47] <leah> so there's that
[22:51:09] <leah> plus they gave out schematics freely (not sure about boardviews, but i can't see how repair is possible without that, so they probably do)
[22:51:40] <leah> > modern intel. so expect blobs, even when/if coreboot is done. but
[22:51:45] <leah> you know, i look at this in two ways
[22:51:57] <leah> 1) i look at the product as-is, and what it's likely to become
[22:52:08] <leah> 2) the intentions behind the company's operations
[22:52:12] *** Joins: ___nick___ (~quassel@cpc68286-cdif17-2-0-cust533.5-1.cable.virginm.net)
[22:52:15] <leah> #2 is solid. they seem to care
[22:52:23] <leah> i see #1 improving. so if you want that machine, go nuts. buy it
[22:52:48] <leah> free ec and free schematics already gives you a lot of power that you won't get with a lot of machines
[22:53:09] <qrpnxz> yeah, i read they freed the ec firmware (bsd-3-clause), but are still using proprietary bios but are looking into coreboot in the future when they are more stable as a company, though you might have heard of further development. Thanks for your comments; i think also that they are ethically minded
[22:53:15] <leah> your average hp machine for example is junk, the moment is goes bad. whereas, with framework you have a completely repairable machine
[22:53:22] <leah> plus i'm guessing they probably design the board to be serviceable
[22:53:39] <leah> qrpnxz: yeah, the company is solid
[22:53:43] <leah> i support what they're doing
[22:54:14] <leah> aptio btw is ami's thing
[22:54:17] <leah> their firmware platform
[22:54:27] <leah> it's what currently ships (uefi firmware platform) on framework machines

[22:55:58] <leah> hope this helps. i'm not informed about their development but i hope they do start shipping coreboot in the future. that would be pretty amazing
[22:55:58] *** Joins: aog (~aog@user/aog)
[22:56:14] <leah> they're at least already miles ahead of the competition, at least in x86 space
[22:56:29] <leah> the competition being... purism and system76
[22:57:22] <leah> though, system76 has also expressed interest in right to repair stuff (they try to provide schematics when able)
[22:57:42] <leah> and *some* system76 machines do have coreboot, or can have coreboot installed. i think some of them have free ec firmware too
[22:57:52] <leah> so yeah. choices
[22:58:22] <qrpnxz> i was definitely way more exited about framework than i ever was about system76. Having a laptop come with linux out of the box was good to hear about, but you know, i feel anybody can do that. Framework was true leap forward.
[22:58:52] <qrpnxz> or leap backwards in a way, because laptops used to be more repairable haha
[22:59:04] <qrpnxz> that is sad
[22:59:13] <qrpnxz> i'm sad-happy
[23:02:26] <leah> yeah well, they're both solid companies
[23:02:38] <leah> (s76 and fw)
[23:03:29] <leah> there are also chromebooks, which come with coreboot (not sure if all have free ec) - stick it in dev mode and you can replace chromeos with anything linux, bsd etc
[23:03:46] <leah> (and recompile whatever coreboot setup you like)
[23:03:59] <leah> though, chromebooks i think are less serviceable than system76 or framework laptops
[23:04:12] <leah> what you get is a blackbox with no schematics, usually
[23:04:19] <leah> so they are inferior in that latter aspect
[23:04:51] <leah> it all depends really what your priorities are. of course, there are also refurbishers doing thinkpads and such
[23:04:53] <leah> again:
[23:04:55] <leah> choices!
[23:05:51] <leah> another interesting thing: apple m1 macbooks. not really "libre" yet (nothing that is or is similar to coreboot), but there's some interest in these things from the asahi linux project
