[00:08:20] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Okay, so in my dream, I was at Target. I was walking past those little mini-fridges that they have by the checkout. You know the ones where you can buy overpriced Diet Coke or Bubly, or Monster or whatever, right? So while walking past one of those I saw a new sparkling water brand. The can I picked up was yellow, indicating some kind of tropical fruit flavor, and the brand
[00:08:22] <quanticle> name was written vertically down the can in bold blue letters: NATE. I figured, huh, I've never tried NATE brand sparkling water, why not? So I bought the can, and walked outside and opened it. And as I was drinking the sparkling water, I looked at the back of the can, and there was a grainy black and white photo of... you guessed it: Nathan Robinson. And as I read the little blurb that that
[00:08:24] <quanticle> accompanied the photo, it stated that after getting kicked out of Current Affairs, Nathan Robinson had decided to, I quote, "embrace his bougie identity" and launch a line of sparkling water to be sold at Target.

[00:11:59] <kuudes> RiversHaveWings, gwern I checked the data spots of 2013q1 and 2020q1
[00:12:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Very easy to install a font on Linux and then your browser ignores it
[00:12:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Many such cases
[00:12:04] <RiversHaveWings> oh?
[00:12:27] <kuudes> there are indeed two different symptoms, E0100A: Behavior - Psychosis - Hallucinations;  E0100B: Behavior - Psychosis - Delusions; and E0100Z: Behavior - Psychosis - None of the Above
[00:13:02] <Urchin[emacs]> Obormot\Arcturus: except it's not ignoring it on other sites

[00:13:21] <nshepperd> quanticle: gonna have to suggest it to Nathan Robinson
[00:13:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Urchin[emacs]: I dunno man. These things happen. I've long since given up on explaining them
[00:13:54] <kuudes> the data is following: 2013q1 A: 2.47% B: 6.35% Z: 92.72%; 2020q1 A: 4.35% B: 2.21% Z: 94.87%.
[00:13:56] <gwern> (the existence of a NATE suggests the existence of a MATE)
[00:14:29] <kuudes> so it seems that total psychosis has dropped, but indeed things have moved B -> A
[00:15:33] <kuudes> but it seems weird that they only focus on the part of symptoms that have dropped, not the symptoms that have increased
[00:15:48] <kuudes> but indeed it appears the hallucinations might not be subset of the thing that has grown
[00:16:03] <kuudes> *delusions are not part of the thing
[00:16:20] <kuudes> ie symptoms have moved from delusions to hallucinations and hallucinations are medicable
[00:16:50] <kuudes> but it seems fewer people in total have either delusions or hallucinations
[00:17:13] <RiversHaveWings> they are both medicable
[00:17:17] <kuudes> so to me it seems possibly be going well? people who needed meds are getting them more, and more people do not need meds and are not getting them
[00:17:44] <nshepperd>  you're saying they remove people from the 'delusions' category if they also get diagnosed with schizophrenia?
[00:18:09] <RiversHaveWings> no they just put people in "none of the above" if they want to medicate them to not have to deal with them being belligerent lol
[00:18:18] <kuudes> nshepperd, it seems possible
[00:18:39] <kuudes> RiversHaveWings, that does not seem likely to me
[00:18:51] <kuudes> as the none of above seems to correspond to 1- (A || B)
[00:19:05] <kuudes> it is coded the other way as A and B
[00:19:44] <kuudes> ie Z = 1 -(A^B) -(A&B)
[00:21:56] <nshepperd> it's also possible the nursing home workers are just lying

[02:37:59] <quanticle> Because, "Who knows what code actuually does"
[02:38:07] <quanticle> It is a bitter mystery, like life
[02:38:46] <kuudes> hmm... so I wonder now what "WHO KNOWS WHAT THE VACCINES DO" means actually
[02:41:30] <quanticle> lol
[02:42:33] <quanticle> I mean, on one level, you're right: the immune system is full of mysteries
[02:44:48] <kuudes> meh, someone already lambasted me for proposing that some doctor would take some extra astrazenecas and start dosing boosters and kids with them as otherwise they will go to waste...
[02:45:35] <quanticle> Some extra AstraZeneca?
[02:45:53] <quanticle> Not extra Pfizer?
[02:45:59] <kuudes> yeah. over here we have very little actually licenced use for astrazeneca
[02:46:14] <kuudes> it is recommended for people aged 65-70
[02:46:35] <quanticle> The reason I'm asking is because Astrazeneca is an adenovirus based vaccine. So your body becomes immune not just to the COVID spike proteins on the vaccine, but also the vaccine carrier itself
[02:46:36] <kuudes> well, you could use extra pfizers but those also could go into other people in the normal process
[02:46:46] <kuudes> so astrazenecas would not be off from anyone
[02:47:09] <kuudes> yes, but for booster it seems to be at least not worse but maybe better than just pfizer
[02:47:14] <kuudes> crossimmunity
[02:47:19] <quanticle> Or are you suggesting that Astrazeneca be used as a booster shot for people who took the Pfizer in the past?
[02:47:28] <kuudes> I would take it if offered
[02:47:42] <kuudes> prescription med so I am wary of recommending anyone anything
[02:47:51] <kuudes> as I am not a doctor
[02:48:09] <kuudes> but booster shots are not currently yet in the program
[02:48:21] <kuudes> but a doctor can in eu and in usa prescribe such to anyone
[02:48:33] <kuudes> if they see that as professionally necessary
[02:48:41] <kuudes> or well, just useful for the patient
[02:49:10] <kuudes> so you can get your under 12 yo vaccinated or 3th or 4th or Nth dose for yourself if a doctor writes you prescription for such
[02:49:16] <kuudes> also in usa.
[02:49:20] <kuudes> currently. today.
[02:49:34] <kuudes> .wp off label use
[02:49:36] <feepbot> kuudes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-label_use Off-label use is the use of pharmaceutical drugs for an unapproved indication or in an unapproved age group, dosage, or route of administration. Both prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs (OTCs) can be used in off-label ways, although most studies of off-label use focus on prescription drugs.

[02:50:37] <kuudes> nice of them to trial that so we don't have to
[02:51:35] <kuudes> quanticle, I am saying that if you want 95% immunity against getting an infection in the first place, you can get a booster already in usa regardless of official decisions

[02:57:04] <kuudes> hmm, that is for a booster, I guess the third dose for immunity was not considered booster but something else
[02:58:48] <saturn2> i don't really understand the reasoning behind it, but it doesn't seem worth the trouble to be a rebel
[02:58:52] <mjr> that's the US recommendation for the third shot, which is called a booster
[02:59:10] <kuudes> usa has two modes for third shot afaik
[02:59:14] <mjr> there's some ambiguity, at least colloquially, whether to call the second shot a booster
[02:59:29] <mjr> though it is a part of the primer/booster set so go figure
[03:01:05] <kuudes> as far as I understand there is some amount of discussion that giving lower immunity people additional dose is different from giving healthy people additional dose
[03:01:20] <kuudes> and that the latter should get lower priority, months, and the former higher priorty, weeks
[03:02:01] <mjr> sure
[03:02:10] <kuudes> https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html "CDC recommends that people with moderately to severely compromised immune systems receive an additional dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine at least 28 days after a second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine."

[03:57:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> There were a bunch of us there, several doing HCI, others doing like robotics or w/e, various things. Anyway, so it turned out that the HCI program was, like... 1 professor. And 1 grad student.
[03:57:25] <quanticle> I was 14 when 9/11 happened. I'm not that much older than Konk
[03:58:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then like a year later I was talking to said grad student (we kept in touch after this program ended) and she was like... "yeah my advisor [the aforesaid single professor] kinda lost interest in my thesis and, like, teaching... and now the HCI program is ???"

[04:41:29] <quanticle> I think "Diet" is a Germanic term. You wouldn't expect Scots to have a "Diet" any more than you'd expect Saxony to have a "Parliament".

[04:43:49] <quanticle> "The word diet derives from Latin and was a common name for an assembly in medieval European polities like the Holy Roman Empire. The Meiji Constitution was largely based on the form of constitutional monarchy found in nineteenth century Prussia and the new Diet was modeled partly on the German Reichstag and partly on the British Westminster system. Unlike the post-war constitution, the Meiji
[04:43:50] <quanticle> constitution granted a real political role to the Emperor, although in practice the Emperor's powers were largely directed by a group of oligarchs called the genrō or elder statesmen."

[04:49:12] <Betawolf> look, Japan became quite powerful over the next half-century...

[05:02:54] <kuudes> if I design a oath of office sometime, I will make it include a process that produces a random outcome, whose result will matter highly somehow
[05:03:08] <kuudes> because roll of dice can't be backsied
[05:03:54] <kuudes> could be that the compensation depends on that roll of dice or that they get either power X or power Y per die

[05:06:11] <kuudes> before presidential signature they are not laws in effect, after presidential signature they are
[05:06:37] <kuudes> and because there are no randoms, we can sometimes do shenanigans like post-date or pre-date law signatures
[05:06:45] <kuudes> with dice, you can't do that
[05:07:22] <kuudes> you have to scrap the whole die, and if there are multiple parties some of which win and some of which lose, the winners have incentive to enforce the roll
[05:08:15] <kuudes> this is why you put a today's newspaper in a photo whose earliest possible date you want to ascertain
[05:08:33] <kuudes> ascertaining end time is macabre, as for that you need to destroy something valuable

[06:57:09] <gwern> reading _A Practical Guide To Evil_ and thinking back to my comments on _Cyberpunk_ and also _Kill 6 Billion Demons_, one of the things the rise of language models is going to do is enable much *denser* fictional universes. when you try to write something like LoTR, including the interspersed sayinsg/proverbs/quotes and all the poetry (how many does LotR have, like 30 poems in it? and many...
[06:57:15] <gwern> ...quite good), it's super hard to make it good. _Kill 6 Billion Demons_'s author tries to do the parables/scriptures/quotes but to be frank, they're pretty bad compared to the artwork. they're much better a comic artist than writer. but it's not like they can just team up with a random poet. except with language models, they can. language models can be randomized and bruteforced and prompted...
[06:57:21] <gwern> ...for samples. I may not be able to write decent poetry or plays for my characters to quote, but I can *recognize* it when I prompt GPT-3 with in-universe descriptions.
[06:58:12] <gwern> you can write the plot and actions, and use a language model to build up banks of worldbuilding in the areas you are weak in. already GPT-3 can crank out decent poetry on a theme much faster than I could write it myself. its proverbs/sayings are also fairly reasonable when I tested those out

[22:46:44] <gwern> can be added later, no?
[22:46:47] <ggreer> I don't know if I care enough about warm towels to go with that. also it looks like they're an appliance that you add afterwards, not something integrated into the bathroom
[22:48:33] <shawwwn> ggggggggggggooooooooooooood morning
[22:48:48] <ggreer> thanks for the suggestions. heated floors are gonna be great

[22:57:01] <gwern> (huh, another vole under the stove. is that the third one this year?)
[22:59:11] <feep> gwern: are there pigs
[22:59:15] <feep> or are ... *you* the hogs
[22:59:47] * gwern investigates closer. no, looks like these weren't voles at all, but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_short-tailed_shrew . huh. a venomous mammal! you don't see one of those every day. apparently you see them once every month or two...
[22:59:48] <Robomot> Northern short-tailed shrew - Wikipedia (The northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) is the largest shrew in the genus Blarina,[3] and occurs in the northeastern region of North America.[4] It is a semifossorial, highly active, and voracious insectivore and is present in a variety of habitats like broadleaved and pine forests among shrubs and hedges as well as grassy river banks.[ …)
[23:00:56] <ggreer> O_o
[23:00:56] <rsaarelm> ggreer: I'd go for a handheld bidet shower instead of an in-toilet bidet. Better control of direction and pressure, might be easier to keep clean.
[23:01:04] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[23:02:09] <gwern> let's see. fat, eats a ton, occasional bursts of extremely rapid movement, nearly blind... yep, my guests have been northern shor-tail shrews all along, and not voles. I wonder how oolon catches them? 'Other shrews spend more time above ground than does the northern short-tailed shrew, which prefers to tunnel along below ground, through the leaf litter, or at the snow/ground interface'
[23:02:49] <gwern> 'The northern short-tailed shrew has a high mortality rate, though it attempts to escape predation by remaining hidden under vegetation, soil, leaf litter, or snow;[4] only 6% of a marked group of shrews survived to the next year,[5] and winter mortality of 90% has been recorded, probably due to cold stress.[3] This shrew is consumed by many predators: trout, snakes, raptors, canids, cats,...
[23:02:55] <gwern> ...mustelids, skunks, raccoons, and opossums,[3][5] though mammalian carnivores appear to be deterred by the musky odor produced by the shrew's scent glands.[5]'
[23:03:10] <feep> a musky odor pervades throughout
[23:03:12] <ggreer> rsaarelm: those seem tricky to use. I'd be worried about spraying in the wrong direction
[23:03:14] <gwern> (not that oolong would try to eat them regardless, he's not into it)
[23:04:28] <rsaarelm> ggreer: How would that happen? The button you press to spray is in the same direction as the sprayer so it's pretty hard to get wrong.
[23:06:38] <ggreer> it just seems like it'd be harder to line up the sprayer in the desired direction while ensuring that everything drains in the desired place. built-in bidets just involve shifting forward/backward a little
[23:07:21] <PapuaHardyNet> maybe you should try both before decidin
[23:07:28] <PapuaHardyNet> (or the one you haven't tried at least)
[23:08:00] <ggreer> my favorite is the japanese style toilets that will heat the bidet water to a precise temperature. I don't know how much maintenance those are though
[23:09:41] <adiabatic> ggreer: I've been spraying my ass for years and not once have I thought "I wish this water were warmer". Should I check my SoCal privilege?
[23:09:46] <kuudes> ggreer, air extraction from toilet/shower is good way to keep the humidity burden of house low
[23:09:57] <ggreer> heh
[23:10:23] <ggreer> kuudes: pretty much every bathroom in the US has an exhaust fan
[23:10:33] <kuudes> indeed
[23:11:09] <ggreer> though I think I'll replace/upgrade mine. newer bearings will probably be quieter
[23:11:11] <kuudes> I have pondered the airplanes-covid thingy, the thing there seems to be suction extraction on floor level to create laminar airflow from top to bottom so you don't exchange air with others that much
[23:11:26] <kuudes> on shower I wonder if water will be a problem though
[23:11:58] <kuudes> oh, and over here a thing most people over look is waterproof doorsteps/frames on wet areas
[23:12:10] <feep> alright! new loop iteration syntax
[23:12:13] <ggreer> I love those but that setup is rare in US bathrooms
[23:12:19] <kuudes> so that in case of indoor flooding the water won't leave the wet areas to dry areas
[23:12:29] <kuudes> yeah, over here too, even though the regulations mandate those
[23:12:43] <feep> https://github.com/Neat-Lang/neat/blob/master/test/runnable/forlooptest.nt#L5 please opine
[23:12:43] <kuudes> it was one of the things that sold me the house I am buying

[23:12:51] <PapuaHardyNet> btw did you guys know that Stephen Wolfram is active and livestreams on Twitch?
[23:13:06] <kuudes> basicly, sort of costly signal - that the dude had built those indicates he has done things better than usual
[23:14:13] <kuudes> bathtub/jacuzzi?
[23:15:04] <ggreer> eh, jets are a lot of maintenance
[23:15:54] <kuudes> sauna?
[23:18:06] <ggreer> there's no such thing as a shower combination sauna, right? I'd have to dedicate a lot of square footage to something I'd hardly ever use
[23:18:22] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[23:18:24] <ggreer> saunas are kinda fun but I never really go out of my way for them
[23:18:33] <kuudes> yeah
[23:19:00] <kuudes> railings are often undervalued until one gets into an accident etc
[23:20:56] <ggreer> oh yeah. I did have a place with a railing in the shower and that was handy
[23:22:51] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: what does he livestream?
[23:23:39] <gwern> also, the anti-slip treads on the floor. I put some down after I slipped and landed flat on my hip and reflected that if I had been 30 years older, that'd probably trigger a morbidity death spiral, assuming I survived it at all
[23:24:28] <gwern> you can install those afterwards since there are ones with adhesive backing but probably nicer if you design the tiles there in the first place
[23:24:34] <kuudes> feep, in "for (i, a in array) { assert(a == "foo" && i == 0); break; }" does the order of indexes somehow default to "int, object"? or how does it deduce type of i and a?
[23:24:36] <adiabatic> ggreer: my father put in steam-room jets into his shower stall, but not sauna
[23:25:21] <feep> kuudes: yeah, "key, value"
[23:25:35] *** Joins: inky (~inky_@46.36.114.205)
[23:25:35] <vrs> feep: I like JS's destructuring syntax for this kind of thing
[23:25:38] <kuudes> but if there is only 1 then it is "value"?
[23:25:41] <feep> yes
[23:25:49] <kuudes> that feels unexpected to me
[23:25:55] <kuudes> why not 1 for "key"?
[23:26:05] <feep> because you almost never want to iterate only keys
[23:26:15] <feep> but you very often want to iterate only values
[23:26:18] <adiabatic> I'm reading Stephen Guise's _Mini Habits_. Did studies that demonstrated the existence of ego depletion survive the replication crisis?
[23:26:19] <kuudes> what would be for(a,b,c in array) ?
[23:26:23] <feep> nothing
[23:26:29] <feep> well, a syntax error :P
[23:26:39] <kuudes> array could be 2 dimensional
[23:26:48] <feep> 2d arrays are not supported yet
[23:27:02] <kuudes> surely you can put an array into an array as an object?
[23:27:11] <feep> explicit structured 2d arrays
[23:27:17] <feep> array in array is a jagged array, they're terrible
[23:27:32] <feep> kuudes: anyway, remember this is a macro language
[23:27:37] <feep> syntax is ~yours~ to improve
[23:27:53] <feep> I'm expecting fast 2d arrays will be handled by libs.
[23:28:00] <kuudes> I guess *shrugs*
[23:28:03] <gwern> adiabatic: no
[23:28:20] <kuudes> I think I will head to ggreer status with covid if/when I get 3-4+ doses for myself and my closest ones
[23:28:26] <adiabatic> gwern: hmmmmmm, thanks
[23:28:34] <kuudes> ie check out of pandemic and let other people have opinions
[23:29:10] <kuudes> 2 doses is not safe enough for me but 3 would seem to be with current stuff and more than that seems better
[23:29:40] <kuudes> so I'll try to get some doctor to off-label it
[23:30:02] <adiabatic> kuudes: what do you do if it's eventually found that kids under 18 are better off not getting a vax because of the risk of side effects worse than what they'd get from the 'rona
[23:30:17] <kuudes> we already vaccinate 12+ in EU
[23:30:27] <kuudes> pfizer has market licence for 12+
[23:31:02] <kuudes> and 5+ years seems incoming in october
[23:31:19] <kuudes> and slovakia jumped the gun and already issued an order for such
[23:31:27] <kuudes> and israel iirc has already for all ages
[23:31:39] <kuudes> pfizer risks are ~1/100k
[23:31:57] <kuudes> which can indeed be worse than the ~1/300k death for 8 yos
[23:32:10] <kuudes> but it seems unlikely. but it is possible
[23:33:17] <kuudes> already my older daughter has likely got the vaccine in the safety study, though it is doubleblinded
[23:33:39] <adiabatic> gwern: at this point, I'm wondering if I should just skim the rest of the book parts that assume that ego depletion is a thing or if alieving (but not believing) believing in ego depletion is a good idea
