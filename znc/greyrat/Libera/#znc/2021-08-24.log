[00:27:16] <Khaytsus> I offhand don't, and annoyingly znc then also saves that new channel to be joined..  so gotta make sure to part it
[00:31:46] <Casper> Exa; [[stickychan]]
[00:31:47] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/stickychan
[00:32:15] <Casper> Stick any chan you -must- join, and it'll keep on trying and trying AND TRYING and so on and so forth.
[00:34:32] <MetaNova> alternatively, putting explicit 'join #chan1,#chan2,#chan3' into [[Perform]] would at least make it attempt to join those _specific_ channels when it connects to the network

[00:34:52] <MetaNova> but stickychan is the more robust option
[00:35:18] <MetaNova> (stickychan will /never/ stop trying to join a stuck channel)
[00:35:27] <Casper> MetaNova, but as they say, if you get forced into an overflow channel, it won't retry :p
[00:35:52] <MetaNova> correct. the perform option is merely a way to ensure it tries to join the desired channels at least once
[00:35:58] <Exa> thanks, I'll give it a try and see if some overflow appear on the next netsplit or server reboot
[00:35:59] <MetaNova> regardless of chansaver having saved them or not

[00:47:48] <Strykar> in the nickserv module, how do I see what is being sent by znc to auth? we swapped ircds from charybdis to ergo and now it appears to not send "/msg nickserv identify nick pass"
[00:48:18] <Strykar> or more likely, it's sending "/msg nickserv identify pass" :/
[00:49:27] <Casper> Then just do /znc *nickserv set nick pass
[00:49:40] <Strykar> I dont remember the pass :(
[00:49:54] <Casper> Reset it... :P
[00:50:31] <Strykar> sadly that would require working email which the box does not have atm
[00:50:57] <Casper> Get that working..... >:D
[00:51:31] <Strykar> so "/znc *nickserv ViewCommands" shows "IDENTIFY NICKSERV IDENTIFY {password}" which I'm unsure how to interpret
[00:51:49] <Casper> Yeah, it will do: /nickserv identify <password>
[00:52:02] <Casper> Which will be what you did with "set <thisStringHere>"
[00:52:11] <DoctorD90> instead of nickserv go with sasl (ok im certificate addicted, you are rigth, it is a drug xD)
[00:52:13] <Strykar> and I can't change that with set unless I know the pass
[00:52:46] <Casper> Eh, I think you could do: /znc *nickserv setcommand IDENTIFY NICKSERV IDENTIFY MyNickName {password} if you must.
[00:56:44] <Strykar> Casper: thanks, that worked to fix the string being sent, sadly it still says "Password incorrect". This db was imported using the provided script from the previous atheme install, I wonder if that borked things
[01:05:52] <Strykar> also why is the command shown as "IDENTIFY NICKSERV IDENTIFY Strykar {password}"? shouldn't it be "IDENTIFY NICKSERV Strykar {password}" for "/msg NICKSERV IDENTIFY Strykar passwd"?
