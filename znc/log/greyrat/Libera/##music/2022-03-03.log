[23:03:48] <macrobat> whatif she has a gun, morf?
[23:07:12] <macrobat> I usually find opera song in the higher registers more unpleasant. I don't enjoy the usual heavy vibrato. strange that it's so hard to pick up what the lyrics are in the vocals
[23:07:36] <macrobat> sounds so unnatural

[23:10:42] <R2robot> yeahhh, that sounds about right. :)
[23:11:08] <louipc> wrong channel, but sure that works
[23:11:12] <R2robot> you've already used 2 logical fallacies in the 2 sentences  you made earlier. I'd expect more of the same rather than an actual discussion.
[23:11:27] <louipc> ok tell me about them there. and we can continue
[23:12:02] <louipc> sounds like a cop out ;)
[23:12:06] <R2robot> ohh, the correct channel is the other 'alt'.. with 1 person. lol

[23:12:39] <louipc> i see you're too scared to talk about politics
[23:12:50] <R2robot> that's your 3rd logical fallacy
[23:13:09] <louipc> so you fall back on denigrating the channels where discussion would be more topical 
[23:13:17] <morf> here we go again
[23:13:28] <louipc> the evidence would suggest otherwise R2robot ;)
[23:13:55] <louipc> R2robot: then invite me wherever you wish. i'll join :D
[23:14:08] <R2robot> logical fallacies with elementary school level baiting.. is not my idea of a discussion.. but thanks for the offer.
