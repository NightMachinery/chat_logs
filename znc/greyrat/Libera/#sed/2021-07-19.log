[17:00:52] <aruns> Hi, how do I capture either .jpg or .png in sed?
[17:01:09] <aruns> 's/\.\(jpg|png\)/\.$1/g' is not working
[17:01:13] <lopid> sed doesn't capture images
[17:01:24] <lopid> \|
[17:01:28] <aruns> That doesn't work
[17:01:32] <aruns> I tried that too
[17:02:24] <lopid> well you're replacing it with itself
[17:02:44] <aruns> But it returns $1 rather than the replacement
[17:02:52] <aruns> If I escape the vertical bar
[17:02:53] <lopid> \1
[17:03:15] <aruns> Ah that works, thanks
[17:03:17] <aruns> So like VIM

[17:05:53] <Soliton> escaping the pipe only works for GNU sed. BRE does not include alternation in general.
[17:06:33] <Soliton> escaping the dot on the right hand side looks weird.
[17:07:43] <Riviera> it's wrong, use a dot
[17:08:33] <Soliton> the g flag is probably useless as well.
[17:09:18] <Riviera> what's the purpose of replacing .jpg and .png with .jpg and .png anyway
[17:09:35] <Riviera> ah, lopid mentioned it already

[19:18:22] <earnestly> Not quite
[19:22:27] <Riviera> grex -g?
[19:23:53] <earnestly> It's still not doing what I expected, a regex to go from A to B, but just a regex that matches A or B
[19:23:58] <GuiToris> I can't find grex, is this a program?
[19:24:09] <earnestly> For their stuff probably: s/^<sound>file:.*\/\(.*\)<\/sound>/<sound>file:\1<\/sound>/
[19:24:16] <earnestly> But this looks like xml

[19:36:02] <curdlesnoot> assuming one can bothered to install Mojolicious or Mojo::DOM58.
[19:36:51] <Riviera> wasn't that a web framework? :D
[19:37:37] <curdlesnoot> Riviera: it is. yet, it manages to be smaller and cleaner than many other CPAN modules that implement the functionality of some of its subclasses. Mojo::DOM58 is just the DOM parsing code ripped out and independently distributed, with 5.8 compatibility.
[19:38:10] <curdlesnoot> it takes seconds to install either, anyway.

[19:38:26] <Riviera> curdlesnoot: thanks for the insight
[19:42:58] <GuiToris> Riviera, umm, is grex a tool for dummies?
[19:44:00] <Riviera> GuiToris: I only learnt about the tool seconds before you, so I am not really the one you should ask.
[19:44:13] <Riviera> GuiToris: But yes, it does seem that one of its uses is for learning regular expressions.
[19:44:37] <GuiToris> I've just checked out the page and I kind of like it
[19:44:56] <Riviera> :)
[20:04:34] <GuiToris> Riviera, hmm I don't know how I could specify that the paths vary
[20:04:50] <GuiToris> I got this output: ^<sound>file:(/House folder/)?fiesta\.ogg</sound>$
[20:05:01] <GuiToris> it thinks House folder is literal
[20:06:27] <earnestly> Of course it does, grex takes inputs and produces a regex that attempts to match them
[20:06:49] <earnestly> If you input 'foo' it will probably output '^foo$'
[20:07:27] <earnestly> GuiToris: It's not going to help you produce regex that transforms one input into another
[20:07:28] <curdlesnoot> what? it does't infer one's unspecified intent? tish and pish, I say!
[20:07:44] <earnestly> It only produces regex to match all given inputs
[20:09:07] <earnestly> fwiw, xmlstarlet/xmllint works with this stuff too
[20:09:41] <earnestly> xpath 1.0 however doesn't have a basename type function
[20:10:16] <GuiToris> curdlesnoot, how could it be specified?
[20:10:29] <GuiToris> there are a handful of options but nothing seems relevant
[20:11:09] <curdlesnoot> it can't be.

[20:12:19] <curdlesnoot> at best, it might aid one's noggin in coming to a tolerable soution.
[20:15:34] <GuiToris> is there such a regex thing: until the first "/" ?
[20:16:04] <GuiToris> file:.*/  would eat all the line till </sound>
[20:21:19] <curdlesnoot> until the first "/" would be dangerous.
[20:21:53] <curdlesnoot> [^/<]* less so. maybe.

[20:28:14] <GuiToris> yeaah
[20:28:15] <GuiToris> thank you
[20:28:44] <curdlesnoot> ayo. hol up. shouldn't it be "file:audio.ogg"?
[20:29:00] <curdlesnoot> in which case, you're nearly there.
[20:29:24] <GuiToris> I'm not sure about that, I'll check what the program expects, but I can change that quite easily

[20:29:39] <shbot> Soliton: <sound>file:/House folder/dormitorio.ogg</sound>
[20:31:50] <GuiToris> Soliton, I thought I was removing the first / 's/file:\//file:/' so it would be less difficult
[20:32:15] <GuiToris> I can replace static things easily

[20:33:06] <shbot> GuiToris: <sound>file:/dormitorio.ogg</sound>
[20:33:47] <GuiToris> it may needs / or ./ or nothing, I don't know yet, I couldn't test it
[20:34:20] <curdlesnoot> where does "House folder" exist in the filesystem?
[20:34:22] *** totenkoph is now known as bamboo
[20:35:32] <curdlesnoot> it almost looks like as though it might be a URI. then again, it doesn't, because the scheme would be "file://" in that case.
[20:37:49] <GuiToris> it's an android program that I've never used, apparently it doesn't handle folders, so I had to move all the contents to one folder. It not clear how it works
[20:38:01] <GuiToris> the files are not in the root directory ofc
