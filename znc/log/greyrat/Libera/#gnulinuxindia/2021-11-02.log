[13:37:57] <pystardust> Mudskipper875[m]: choose the one with higher bitrate, both can store high quality audio better than mp3 but wrose than flac
[13:43:12] <Mudskipper875[m]> <pystardust> "Mudskipper875: choose the one..." <- Thanks üëç

[15:58:35] <gtlsgamr> Hi all! TIFU by installing a custom rom and bricking my device, in the process losing my music collection of 5 years.
[16:00:27] <Arya[m]> lol
[16:00:32] <Arya[m]> didnt back up?
[16:02:42] <gtlsgamr> Forgot :(
[16:15:34] <Arya[m]> lol
[16:15:49] <Arya[m]> it would have anyways wiped the data right
[16:15:55] <Arya[m]> even if u didnt brick it
[16:19:41] <Mudskipper875[m]> <gtlsgamr> "Hi all! TIFU by installing a..." <- Damn bro... that sucks!
[16:20:29] <Mudskipper875[m]> Arya[m]: ü§î
[16:21:42] <gtlsgamr> Yeah I know
[16:21:48] <gtlsgamr> the brick is a bonus Arya[m] 
[16:21:54] <Arya[m]> lol
[16:24:09] <Mudskipper875[m]> gtlsgamr: What device?
[16:24:17] <gtlsgamr> op6t
[16:25:38] <Mudskipper875[m]> What about photos etc.? Are those backed up?
[16:26:42] <gtlsgamr>  I am ashamed to say this, but I use google photos. :(
[16:28:12] <Mudskipper875[m]> gtlsgamr: No shame bro. I'm sure everyone who owned an Android used it at one point üòÖ
[16:29:06] <Mudskipper875[m]> Your pictures are probably more precious than the songs, so its good that it was at least backed up üëç
[16:31:41] <Arya[m]> google photos for some reason is the gallery app by default on nokia
[16:32:00] <gtlsgamr> And it is the best!
[16:33:13] <Mudskipper875[m]> Until 2020 google photos had unlimited storage, thats why it got so popular
[19:10:04] <gtlsgamr> planning to leave gphotos soon... I have a hard drive I can use for storage now.
[19:10:09] <gtlsgamr> Any suggestions, if anyone is using>?
[19:34:57] <Mudskipper875[m]> <gtlsgamr> "planning to leave gphotos soon....." <- Use syncthing... its the most convenient
[19:38:30] <gtlsgamr> Mudskipper875[m]: still doesn't have gphotos like features
[19:39:43] <Mudskipper875[m]> gtlsgamr: Oh.. if u need the features, then its gonna be hard to replace.. 
[19:51:58] <Mudskipper875[m]> <gtlsgamr> "Mudskipper875: still doesn't..." <- Try some local photo manager app
[19:52:04] <Mudskipper875[m]> Take a loot at digikam
