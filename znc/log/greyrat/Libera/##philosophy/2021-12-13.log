[00:38:53] <causative> biys, if having too many of a certain segment of the population is a problem, then clearly *lowering* that birth rate would be beneficial
[00:39:16] <causative> lowering the birth rate just for that segment
[00:39:31] <causative> if it could be done in a way that doesn't involve human rights violations
[00:40:01] <causative> and providing more education - *just* for that segment, not for other segments - is expected to lower the birth rate for that segment, and does not violate anyone's rights
[00:43:23] <biys> causative: there's a book called "poor-bashing" by jean swanson
[00:43:26] <biys> you ever heard of it?
[00:43:43] <causative> no
[00:44:52] <I_Am_M00t> Elon musk said we should have more children to survive, lol
[00:45:15] <causative> the segment in question is the segment of the population with below-average IQ
[00:45:51] <causative> who reproduce at a higher than average rate, which seems potentially a problem, long-term
[00:46:25] <I_Am_M00t> :) eugenics
[00:46:59] <causative> but in a way that respects the human rights of everyone - just giving more access to free higher education to that segment
[00:47:12] <I_Am_M00t> imagine using IQ to choose who to kill off
[00:47:33] <causative> yeah see that would be relevant if I had said something else
[00:48:40] <causative> imagine drawing an equivalence between killing someone and offering them a free college education
[00:54:39] <biys> and i get what you're saying causative
[00:54:52] <biys> the thing about creating social programs to help marginalized people is...
[00:55:16] <biys> those programs usually don't help the intended groups as intended
[00:56:36] <causative> that's the standard conservative talking point, which would potentially be relevant if I were making the standard case for helping the poor
[00:56:52] <biys> "educate the poor and they will have less kids"
[00:56:58] <biys> i think THAT is the standard conservative talking point
[00:57:18] <causative> really?  I have never heard that from liberal *or* conservative media
[00:57:34] <causative> find me three or four citations if you claim it is a "standard" talking point
[00:57:49] <biys> well the reason they're in the situations they're in is because of the lack of their education or investment in self
[00:58:16] <biys> so we create social programs to provide peopel with education
[00:58:25] <biys> but the thing is... those social programs aren't used by the marginalized
[00:58:37] <biys> they're used by immigrants, largly in this case
[00:58:42] <biys> i can tell you, where i live
[00:58:51] <biys> one can partake of free secondary education
[00:58:56] <biys> "adult basic education" they call it
[00:59:00] <biys> it's cmopletely and entirely free
[00:59:18] <biys> it isn't filled with the types of peopel you'd think it _ought_ be filled by
[00:59:58] <causative> yes, most civilized places including the US have free secondary education
[01:00:09] <causative> you might have noticed I was referring to free *college* education, which is tertiary
[01:00:11] <biys> in canada it depends which province you're in
[01:00:23] <biys> for example.  one province over... the same thing is ~$1500 a class
[01:00:25] <causative> really, there are places in canada without free public high schools?
[01:00:33] <biys> ADULT
[01:00:33] <biys> BASIC
[01:00:35] <biys> EDUCATION
[01:00:40] <biys> i'm done with this
[01:01:02] <biys> are you saying highschools have adults in them learning?
[01:01:12] <causative> I'm saying public high schools are free secondary education
[01:01:14] <biys> i mean... this conversation is just so outlandish cause you keep pivoting around these non-points
[01:01:26] <biys> we're takling about marginalized groups of society
[01:01:29] <biys> not fucking highschool students
[01:01:55] <causative> I'm not sure that there's evidence that remedial high-school-level adult learning reduces birth rates
[01:02:01] <causative> there *is* evidence that college education reduces birth rates
[01:02:21] <causative> when I say "college," I mean university level, e.g. age 19-25
[01:02:34] <biys> well who are you attempting to help?  those that are currently marginalized or those who are maybe going to be marginalized int he future?
[01:03:02] <biys> women who've had babies they can't raise and continue to have more or those who haven't had babies yet?
[01:03:05] <biys> i'm lost on your position here
[01:03:22] <causative> you're lost because all you're doing is repeating the conservative talking points against helping the poor
[01:03:28] <causative> when I haven't said a thing about *helping* the poor
[01:03:33] <biys> "against helping the poor"
[01:03:53] <biys> your position is that uneducated peopel who are producing unfit children
[01:03:56] <biys> need "education"
[01:04:14] <biys> i'm saying that those that are currently in the state of being marginalized WILL NOT be using the services you're suggesting should exist
[01:04:42] <causative> the question is not whether they will or will not be using them - obviously *some* will be using them and you'd be intellectually dishonest if you didn't admit that
[01:04:58] <causative> and obviously if you make it free, *more* will be using them than otherwise would - again, intellectually dishonest not to admit that
[01:05:20] <biys> i'm telling you, where i live these "education" initiatives exist.  they aren't filled with single moms that have 4 or 5 kids living on social assistance
[01:05:46] <causative> first admit those two obvious things, please
[01:06:04] <biys> you're not my lord
[01:06:07] <causative> or I'm done because you just are not engaging with the actual argument I'm making, you're engaging with an imagined liberal viewpoint that is not my present position
[01:06:10] <biys> i'm done
[01:06:19] <biys> because you keep talking about things that are factually incorrect
[01:06:56] <biys> your position is that those that have made poor decisions about their lives, had children, continue to make poor decisions in their lives, have more children
[01:07:09] <biys> are suddenly going to have the time and ability to just "get educated"
[01:07:20] <biys> and it's so outlandish that it reminds me of the book "poor bashing" by jean swanson
[01:07:22] <causative> if you're an idiot, ok
[01:08:07] <causative> (no, that is not an accurate description of my position)
[01:08:08] <biys> they are going to  have the time/ability/DRIVE to "get educated"
[01:08:11] <biys> it's just SO SIMPLE!
[01:08:34] <biys> why ahven't we been DOING THIS?!
[01:08:38] <biys> problem solved boys
[01:08:43] <biys> check that one off the list
[01:09:18] <biys> then we're expecting the children who've b een raised by parents who don't value education
[01:09:22] <pepper> Maybe the reason they are poor and marginalized is because they are simply stupid, so free education is wasted on them and they'll continue to breed as long as you feed them?
[01:09:30] <biys> we expect them to just adopt some kind of significant regard for education themselves!
[01:09:34] <biys> MY GOD!  it's SO SIMPLE!
[01:10:02] <causative> intellectually dishonest, engaging with a strawman only
[01:10:21] <biys> causative: "strawman"
[01:10:27] <biys> you've left really nothing to your position on the matter
[01:10:35] <biys> other than "educate the poor and they'll have less kids"
[01:10:37] <biys> so simple
[01:11:02] <biys> such a drastic oversimplification it's absurd
[01:11:11] <causative> well, *that* is not a strawman, that is accurate.  But it is not equivalent to the other thing you were just criticizing.
[01:12:52] <causative> listen, let's make up some figures and imagine that 10% of "the poor" (however you define it) pursue higher education.  Suppose higher education is made free, barriers reduced.  Do you think that 10% is going to rise or fall?  If it rises to 20%, that's consistent with my point, while still being only a small minority pursuing higher education.
[01:13:17] <biys> but we've already established that uneducated people are having MORE kids than the educated
[01:13:48] <causative> this is a failure of basic numerical reasoning
[01:14:34] <biys> so lets say the ratio is 3 to 1
[01:14:44] <biys> which, from most people i know, is something like 4 to 1
[01:14:49] <causative> the question is whether the poor, in the absence of free higher education, would have more or fewer kids than the poor in the presence of free higher education
[01:14:54] <biys> you're saying that 10% of poor people are being "saved"
[01:14:59] <causative> and the answer is obviously that they would have fewer
[01:15:02] <biys> yet they're having significantly more children
[01:15:08] <causative> and I haven't said a thing about saving anybody
[01:15:19] <causative> that's, again, the liberal strawman you found it convenient to parrot conservative talking points against
[01:15:19] <biys> you'd need a percentage of peopel being "saved" that is greater than the production of children
[01:15:42] <causative> er, *the answer is that the poor in the presence of free higher education would have fewer
[01:15:58] <causative> no, that is not what is needed for the point
[01:16:02] <biys> they wouldn't likely be poor with higher education either
[01:16:15] <causative> no, you are again failing at basic numerical reasoning
[01:16:30] <biys> if they have a higher level of education they would be qualified for more positions
[01:16:37] <biys> thus decreasing their unemployment
[01:16:44] <biys> i mean... this is all just common worldly understanding
[01:17:08] <pepper> What is your criteria for poor? Lack of access to moders smartphones with internet access or access to libraries? Because more "poor" people that live in countries that can afford "free higher education" have access to those, and hence, more information at their fingertips than they could even hope to absorb in their lifetime.
[01:17:19] <pepper> :s/moders/modern
[01:17:26] <causative> well, "poor" here is used as a proxy for "low-IQ" which is what I'm actually talking about
[01:17:37] <biys> i use the term marginalized
[01:17:41] <biys> cause i don't like the term "poor"
[01:17:50] <biys> and i think low-iq isn't really anything that you can nail down
[01:17:58] <pepper> I'll use the term stupid.
[01:18:01] <causative> whatever, it's not what I'm talking about, you're using that word because it is, again, the liberal viewpoint you'd rather argue against instead of mine
[01:18:17] <biys> i think children should be taken from the parents and raised by the state
[01:18:24] <biys> provided the state does a good job of it
[01:18:25] <causative> if these lower-IQ people attend college in greater numbers than before, the genetic component of their IQ is unchanged, but their number of children will on average reduce
[01:18:37] <causative> yes, their socioeconomic status may rise
[01:18:52] <causative> and their tested IQ may also rise - higher education actually seems to raise IQ directly
[01:19:00] <causative> but the genetic component is not going to rise
[01:19:01] <biys> i think this conversation also needs to be broken down into a couple different sub categories to be talked abotu completely
[01:19:18] <biys> i don't think women without children who are getting "Educated" are the same as women with children who are "getting educated"
[01:19:24] <biys> those are two different groups
[01:19:55] <causative> what happens is that if you give college opportunities to people, they will look forward to them and avoid having children at least until college is done
[01:20:06] <biys> imagine this.  you're a SAHM and you have two kids under three.  tell me what time you're going to have to persue education
[01:20:11] <causative> and then if they become more career-oriented they avoid having children for longer than that
[01:20:32] <biys> tell me what social programs y ou're going to be able to partake of?  where i live it's something like $1500 a month for child care per child
[01:20:36] <causative> yes, what you just said isn't relevant
[01:20:51] <causative> because we're talking about childless 18 year olds choosing to enter college instead of immediately having kids and working
[01:20:53] <biys> how does a mother who has kids already! (the currently marginalized) going to partake in these social programs you're suggesting?
[01:21:02] <biys> they can't
[01:21:10] <biys> because their time is already monopolized
[01:21:19] <biys> their time and their funds
[01:21:27] <causative> yeah, great, would be a very nice point if I were saying anything about mothers who have kids already
[01:21:38] <biys> keep qualifying your position on the matter
[01:21:43] <biys> till you'er talking about a VERY small portion of people
[01:22:14] <biys> now you're "helping" 10% of a TINY gruop of people
[01:22:19] <causative> low-IQ teenagers, some of whom do have kids but most of whom are childless
[01:22:27] <causative> it is not the case that 10% of low-IQ teenagers have children
[01:22:29] <causative> er
[01:22:42] <causative> it is not the case that 10% of low-IQ teenagers are childless
[01:22:50] <biys> the goalposts have moved so much during this conversation
[01:22:52] <biys> it's insane
[01:22:53] <causative> it's more like 90%
[01:23:22] <causative> no goalposts were moved
[01:23:28] <biys> now instead of talking about people with kids who should partake in social programs to fix the gap in understanding
[01:23:35] <biys> we're talking about catching the gap in understanding before it happens
[01:23:39] <biys> which is two completely different things
[01:24:10] <causative> the equivocation is entirely yours, because you had in your mind "marginalized" people, when I began with "low-IQ" people
[01:24:18] <causative> and you're still talking about "marginalized" people
[01:24:20] <causative> god knows why
[01:24:31] <biys> the whole conversation started with m usk saying we need to increase birth rates
[01:24:40] <biys> and you suggesting people need education to have less kids
[01:24:45] <biys> so idk what you think you're talking about
[01:24:49] <pepper> calling the marginalized and trying to help them gives you virtue signal points
[01:24:56] <pepper> them*
[01:25:26] <biys> so there, we've found out what the deal is.  we're talking about two different groups of people
[01:25:36] <biys> you're taling about educating highschool students prior to them having children
[01:25:50] <biys> and i'm talking about those that are currently marginalized to some extent
[01:26:00] <causative> alright, you were talking about musk, the other day and today
[01:26:09] <causative> I hadn't read musk and my point was not about whatever he said
[01:26:23] <biys> it was also a conversation about the fitness of children as well
[01:26:36] <biys> fitness is the sense of their ability to compete in the global market
[01:26:37] <biys> IIRC
[01:26:44] <biys> s/is/in/
[01:26:44] <ro-bot-o> biys meant to say: fitness in the sense of their ability to compete in the global market
[01:27:02] *** Quits: emmeka (~emmeka@162-251-198-66.dynamic.parolink.net) (Quit: c'est en se plantant, qu'on devient cultivé)
[01:27:06] <biys> and i said that if the children have parents that don't value education
[01:27:12] <biys> it is unlikely the children will value education themselves
[01:27:43] <causative> well, whatever you said, my point was not exactly a response to that or to musk
[01:27:51] <biys> then you started talking about the "solution" to the problem (the problem being low birth rates)
[01:28:03] <biys> the solution you've positioned is "Education" because it "reduces birth rates"
[01:28:11] <biys> given the context of the conversation (musks position)
[01:28:17] <biys> i'm not sure what you think you're talking about anymore
[01:28:21] <causative> that account of events makes no sense at all, thus you're obviously misinterpreting me
[01:28:32] <biys> "makes no sense"
[01:28:33] <biys> i know!
[01:28:42] <causative> the problem my point was about was *high* birth rates among lower-IQ people
[01:28:47] <biys> i have no clue what you think you're even talking about anymore
[01:30:03] <causative> it's hard for me to tell the difference between someone who is being intellectually dishonest and someone who just isn't following what I've said
[01:30:34] <biys> i didn't follow y our shift in the conversation
[01:30:35] <biys> beg your pardon
[01:31:07] <causative> well, the problem I was describing was the higher birth rates among low-IQ people, relative to high-IQ people, and the likely population shift that would result from that
[01:31:08] <biys> as i said over and over and over again that the social programs aren't going to go to those who need them as a result of their time being monopolized existingly
[01:31:33] <biys> if a person is poor they don't have time to educate themselves.  they're just tryign to survive
[01:31:43] <causative> for the nth time none of my rhetoric has been about what this or that marginalized person needs! JFC
[01:32:07] <biys> you ahve to admit that the "low-iq people" have children BEFORE and AFTER secondary school though.. right?
[01:32:10] <causative> again, it's hard for me to tell the difference between someone who is being intellectually dishonest and someone who just isn't following
[01:32:26] <biys> there isn't only one period in time when people can have children
[01:32:36] <causative> no, hardly any have children *before* secondary school, which would be pre-pubescent
[01:32:40] <biys> women can have kids till they're like 50 or so i think
[01:32:56] <biys> exactly!
[01:33:06] <biys> so if they're low IQ and they don't value education
[01:33:14] <biys> how are you going to "catch them" before it's "too late" ?
[01:33:16] <biys> figuratively speaking
[01:33:42] <biys> it is likely they will pass through the system and end up pregnant once they're outside the grasps of the education systems
[01:33:45] <biys> then what?
[01:34:22] <causative> if they do, they will at least be older, and perhaps they won't because education will also make them more career-oriented instead of child-oriented
[01:34:52] <causative> number of children per woman matters with respect to reproductive fitness, and so does age of the woman at childbirth
[01:35:26] <biys> so in a world where we can simply draw a new starting point
[01:35:35] <audrey> Ugh, are we seriously still talking about goddamn IQ
[01:35:35] <biys> i think your solution is possible
[01:35:49] <biys> but we can't simply draw a new starting point
[01:36:08] <biys> at this point there are people who are in the situations outside of the control of your solution
[01:36:33] <audrey> <biys> audrey: the original conversation was about stagnant birth rates.  what musk said last week.
[01:36:44] <biys> the indoctrination is taking place.  frmo the parents who don't value education to their children
[01:36:53] <biys> as we speak, right now, at this point in time
[01:36:54] <audrey> OK, going back to this since the conversation that followed appears to have collided with causative's signature obstinacy
[01:37:15] <audrey> The problem is that it's simply not economically lucrative in modern Western economies to have children
[01:37:29] *** Quits: dez (uid92154@user/dez) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:37:30] <audrey> and with the proliferation of contraceptives, abortifacients, and abortions, this seems unlikely to change
[01:37:46] <audrey> since pregnancy is increasingly viewed as an inconvenience for the woman and a distraction from career and financial pursuits
[01:38:08] <biys> well....  not really but sure
[01:38:12] <biys> depends who you ask
[01:38:23] <biys> some women are completely fine with b eing home-makers
[01:38:27] <biys> some women want careers
[01:38:35] <biys> i think we can't sumamrize all women as wanting either
[01:38:39] <causative> that's what *he* apparently was talking about at one time the other day audrey , my point was about something related but different
[01:39:08] <audrey> Well, my point is that the women who want to be homemakers represent a declining share of the adult female population
[01:39:09] <biys> i think it could also be argued that being a home maker IS a career
[01:39:20] <audrey> For various socioeconomic and cultural reasons
[01:39:29] <biys> fair enough
[01:40:02] <audrey> I wouldn't mind being a homemaker, personally, but the way modern Western society is set up this is very difficult to do
[01:40:03] <biys> idk about socioeconomic or cultural as much as propaganda either
[01:40:04] <biys> but sure.
[01:40:15] <audrey> I kind of like the idea of settling down with a nice woman and adopting a child or two
[01:40:24] <audrey> But that seems like a remote possibility from multiple perspectives
[01:40:54] <audrey> biys: I mean, I was going to say "propaganda" but trying to maintain a veneer of impartiality here :P
[01:40:56] <biys> okay.  so i do agree with you causative on the importance of education.  my conversation, the one i was having, was a solution for the situation as it stands
[01:41:11] <pepper> "The homemaker has the ultimate career. All other careers exist for one purpose only - and that is to support the ultimate career." - C.S. Lewis
[01:41:31] <biys> audrey: i don't think it's an organic movement in the slightest
[01:41:36] <biys> the fact women aren't having babies
[01:41:39] <biys> but that is beside the point
[01:41:46] <causative> the problem I was addressing biys is the one portrayed in Idiocracy
[01:41:57] <biys> causative: i get it now.  beg your pardon
[01:41:58] <audrey> I mean, I would definitely not want to have biological children
[01:42:24] <audrey> and if we're talking about some sort of "married to a Christian man and living in a house with a picket fence"  scenario, no, I definitely do not want that, and I think many women never really did
[01:42:43] <biys> haha. "trad"
[01:42:46] <biys> aka traditional living
[01:42:57] <causative> declining birth rates in an absolute sense are not a bad thing
[01:43:06] <causative> the Earth is drastically overpopulated
[01:43:12] <biys> i got a buddy who's 38 years old who i talk to on a regular basis who's just chapped that he spent the first 1/3 of his life playing games instead of "finding a wife"
[01:43:17] <biys> he says women are superficial
[01:43:20] <audrey> I mean, I'm "trad" by homosexual standards since I don't go to sex parties I guess
[01:43:46] <biys> he says "women now days have so much baggage"
[01:43:49] <causative> it would be great if we could, without strife or violation of rights, cut the global birth rate in half uniformly for a generation or two
[01:43:51] <biys> and i'm like "dude, you have so much baggage"
[01:43:58] <biys> he's a laugh to talk with.
[01:44:08] <audrey> People who complain other people have too much baggage, usually have too much baggage.
[01:44:13] <biys> ^
[01:44:15] <biys> this
[01:44:16] <audrey> I say this as someone who complains other people have too much baggage.
[01:44:30] <audrey> But then again most lesbos have baggage.
[01:44:34] <causative> even if we could cut the birth rate in Western countries alone, this would be a good thing, because Westerners use far more global resources per person than the developing world
[01:44:46] <audrey> (I'm in a self deprecating mood this evening._)
[01:44:58] <causative> and additionally the coming rise of automation will render the multitudes much less necessary to the economy
[01:45:09] <biys> causative: JBP talked about this lots
[01:45:18] <biys> he says that the low iq positions are being automated
[01:45:24] <biys> and what are we gonna do with all the low iq people
[01:45:28] <causative> if you have hundreds of millions of people who can do nothing economically useful, this is a big problem for society, and it would be better if the population had been painlessly reduced beforehandd
[01:45:29] <audrey> biys: Did you ever try to unpack what your friend means by "baggage"? Is that just code for "she's slept around with too many men and now I can't be with her because it would threaten my fragile masculinity"
[01:45:46] <causative> when I say painlessly I mean without violating rights
[01:46:05] <biys> audrey: i also think that women that would be within his age group would likely be smarter as they've been around (if this makes sense) so they'd like see him as a fraud
[01:46:16] <causative> through social policies that aren't evil
[01:46:17] <biys> s/like/likely/
[01:46:17] <ro-bot-o> biys meant to say: audrey: i also think that women that would be within his age group would likelyly be smarter as they've been around (if this makes sense) so they'd like see him as a fraud
[01:46:33] <biys> that didn't work at all
[01:47:03] <causative> actually, it will be impossible to reduce the population fast enough to keep up with the rate at which automation will be replacing jobs
[01:47:15] <causative> but every little bit may help reduce the amount of resulting strife
[01:47:31] <audrey> I mean, the existential dread behind automation has been a theme since at least the 1970s.
[01:47:40] <causative> either mass starvation, or riots leading either to mass slaughter or destabilization of society
[01:47:47] <biys> remember prior to covid there aws all teh talk about automating the trucking industry?
[01:47:56] <biys> now we're talking about supply chain shortages
[01:48:01] *** Joins: medium_cool (~medium_co@2605:a601:a9aa:f800:d59c:1606:be8c:4404)
[01:48:05] <audrey> Herman Tennessen talked about depression being a primarily upper-class phenomenon in the 19th century, and that the increasing amounts of leisure time among the middle class resulting in a spike in mental problems with them.
[01:48:20] <biys> that makes sense
[01:48:28] <causative> the trucking industry is without a doubt soon to be significantly more automated biys
[01:48:33] <biys> if you're busy you don't really have time to contemplate existence
[01:48:54] <causative> we'll probably have self-driving trucks on the road commercially in 10 years
[01:48:56] <audrey> In the 1970s, many psychiatrists would advise their wealthy clients, suffering from bouts of existential misery, to create utterly useless devices in their spare time.
[01:49:12] <biys> causative: what's messed about that is... there's tons of initiatives right now to recruit more truck drivers.  ONCE it becomes automated i *hope* they have a place for all the displaced workers
[01:49:13] <audrey> The example given by Tennessen is the billionaire who invents a motorized chicken feeder that is so badly designed that it cannot even move under its own weight.
[01:49:17] <biys> but that's just me
[01:49:38] <audrey> It doesn't matter that the device is pointless; what matters is that the billionaire's mind has been successfully diverted from the terror of a meaningless existence
[01:49:52] <I_Am_M00t> audrey: isn't that just called a hobby?
[01:50:07] <audrey> Calder's "mobiles" might fall into this category, if you've ever visited the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
[01:50:12] <causative> how sad it is to be a billionaire with "existential terror," that poor man, glad I'm not in his shoes

[01:51:36] <biys> i have to yell into this microphone for a bit
[01:51:39] <biys> i have to do a manifesto
[01:51:40] <biys> fml
[01:51:53] <audrey> biys: Is this part of your woke educational curriculum?
[01:52:02] <biys> yah.  hah
[01:52:08] <audrey> biys: What the hell, man
[01:52:22] <audrey> I took some nonsense courses in my time but this seems to be all out of proportion
[01:52:36] <biys> my manifesto is on not trying and not competing because you're only promoting capitalism
[01:52:39] <biys> HAH
[01:53:27] <audrey> biys: I like your thinking.
[01:53:46] <biys> the class, we read uh...  Tuesday with Morrie
[01:53:53] <biys> and Donne - No man is an island
[01:54:00] <audrey> Good luck not getting cancelled though lol
[01:54:11] <biys> and uh...  abunch of kind of like.  neo-lib, globalist literature
[01:54:27] <biys> rawlsian original position, veil of ignorance type stuff
[01:54:34] <biys> and the manifesto is supposed to be our summary
[01:54:38] <biys> and i have to record it
[01:54:42] <biys> "with feeling"
[01:55:00] <audrey> That sounds like some bullshit, man
[01:55:07] <biys> welcome to canada
[01:55:41] <biys> canadian curriculum is pretty much...  social change (one ship analogy) and uh... sustainable development
[01:55:59] <audrey> I mean this sounds similar to the educational model in the USSR
[01:56:04] <biys> where we should be caught up with the superficial aspects of life
[01:56:11] <biys> we should be caught up with helping each other out
[01:56:13] <audrey> they shoehorned Party talking points into /every/ subject
[01:56:19] <biys> and having a vested interest in the progression of society
[01:56:38] <audrey> and the consensus was that you would nod and pay lip service and then quickly move onto real stuff
[01:56:42] <biys> shouldn't be caught up in the superficial aspects
[01:56:45] <biys> is what i meant to say
[01:57:02] <biys> oh yah. i actually got two terrible marks for being critical of the curriculum
[01:57:07] <audrey> You're familiar with Vaclav Havel's grocer, right?
[01:57:07] <biys> so i wrote like a champ
[01:57:16] <biys> no
[01:57:24] <biys> i'll read it though
[01:57:29] <audrey> Oh dear! Bad move, biys. We can't have you actually applying those critical thinking skills.
[01:57:39] <biys> the power of the powerless ?
[01:58:21] <audrey> biys: Yes
[01:58:39] <biys> i actually suggested that Mitch Albom (the author of tuesday with morrie) was a self service narcissist who would walk on the graves of dead peopel to make money
[01:58:46] <audrey> biys: The parallels with contemporary US/CA progressive society are uncomfortably strong.
[01:58:48] <biys> and i proved my case
[01:58:54] <biys> and he told me "you're a dark person"
[01:58:57] <biys> i laughed
[01:59:39] <audrey> biys: Havel basically describes the phenomenon of "cancelling"
[01:59:43] <biys> mitch albom scabbed frmo his union and exploited an old man who was dying so he could write a book and move into the self-help literature area
[01:59:56] <biys> but he's considered an admirable person now days
[02:00:27] <audrey> "The manager of a fruit-and-vegetable shop places in his window, among the onions and carrots, the slogan: "Workers of the world, unite!" Why does he do it? What is he trying to communicate to the world? Is he genuinely enthusiastic about the idea of unity among the workers of the world? Is his enthusiasm so great that he feels an irrepressible impulse to acquaint the public with his ideals?"

[02:00:52] <audrey> ^ Replace this with the DSA political slogan du jour and you have accurately described the state of US politics circa 2021.
[02:00:58] <biys> https://hac.bard.edu/amor-mundi/the-power-of-the-powerless-vaclav-havel-2011-12-23
[02:00:59] <ro-bot-o> [url] "The Power of the Powerless" - Vaclav Havel | hac.bard.edu
[02:01:01] <biys> is that it ?
[02:01:06] <biys> it's short?
[02:01:09] <audrey> Yes!
[02:01:21] <audrey> You can skip straight to chapter II
[02:01:24] <audrey> where the greengrocer is mentioned
[02:01:43] <audrey> The first chapter kind of rambles and isn't directly relevant to this conversation
[02:02:12] <biys> i ramble a lot
[02:03:05] <biys> what's even more sketch is... our state sponsored media (cbc) gets some huge amount of money from the feds yearly
[02:03:10] <audrey> " the overwhelming majority of shopkeepers never think about the slogans they put in their windows, nor do they use them to express their real opinions. That poster was delivered to our greengrocer from the enterprise headquarters along with the onions and carrots. He put them all into the window simply because it has been done that way for years, because everyone does it, and because that is the way it has to be. If he were to refuse, there could be
[02:03:10] <audrey> trouble. He could be reproached for not having the proper decoration in his window; someone might even accuse him of disloyalty. He does it because these things must be done if one is to get along in life ..."
[02:03:18] <biys> and the curriculum in school is the exact same as all the talking points on CBC
[02:03:24] <audrey> " ....  The slogan is really a sign, and as such it contains a subliminal but very definite message. Verbally, it might be expressed this way: "I, the greengrocer XY, live here and I know what I must do. I behave in the manner expected of me. I can be depended upon and am beyond reproach. I am obedient and therefore I have the right to be left in peace." This message, of course, has an addressee: it is directed above, to the greengrocer's superior, and
[02:03:25] <audrey> at the same time it is a shield that protects the greengrocer from potential informers. The slogan's real meaning, therefore, is rooted firmly in the greengrocer's existence. It reflects his vital interests."
[02:03:29] <audrey> (End quote)
[02:03:36] <biys> basically if you flip on CBC radio and look at the school curriculum they are the exact same thing
[02:04:44] <biys> that makes sense
[02:04:52] <biys> and it is exactly cancel culture
[02:05:07] <biys> where if you don't uphold specific ideals you're subject to scrutiny
[02:05:16] <biys> they will dig and find as much as they can to build a case
[02:05:21] <biys> to show you're gaijin
[02:05:41] <biys> all the while talking about the ideas of inclusivity!
[02:05:44] <biys> and acceptance!
[02:05:57] <audrey> My (partial) solution is to keep as low of a profile as possible.
[02:06:18] <biys> oh yah,  my parents are full anti-vax and go to protests and stuff
[02:06:20] <audrey> The attitude of the average Soviet citizen toward politics and the government was one of maximal avoidance.
[02:06:27] <biys> and i'm like...  wondering if i can change my last name
[02:06:35] <audrey> I think this is perfectly sensible for me today in the United States.
[02:06:37] <I_Am_M00t> lol, feels like we're dipping our toes into exaggeration land
[02:06:54] <audrey> biys: You have my sympathies. :{
[02:07:30] <biys> audrey: i agree with that actually.  i'm afraid to associated myself with anything now days
[02:07:41] <biys> people ask me my opinion and i'm like: "nope"
[02:08:04] <audrey> biys: Heh. At my previous job some coworkers got mad at me when I refused to participate in a political conversation.
[02:08:05] <biys> because it's only a matter of time until something unfavourable happens
[02:08:29] <audrey> I just gave a polite little smile and demurred.
[02:08:43] <biys> either that or i talk over their heads on the matter
[02:08:46] <biys> and then walk away
[02:09:16] <audrey> Heck, you don't know who's listening, or what might come back to haunt you.
[02:09:22] <biys> truth
[02:09:29] <audrey> Social media is terrible for this because there is a permanent record of every idiotic thing someone says while drunk or on the toilet at 3am.
[02:10:21] <biys> peopel do seem to be aware of that though...  that buddy that i told you about.  the one who feels his biological clock is ticking.  he keeps asking me about "signal" (some chat app)
[02:10:27] <biys> and he keeps telling me it' "encrypted"
[02:10:34] <audrey> Kind of like in the great Hindu oral tradition, which says there is a great book in which all the things you have ever said and thought are written down, and one day the book will be used to judge you
[02:10:35] <biys> i asked him about 10 times who holds the keys
[02:10:38] <biys> he had no clue what i was talking about
[02:10:45] <biys> he knew what he was saying was potentially problematic
[02:10:57] <biys> he knows he needs to conceil it
[02:11:06] <audrey> The only social media I use is Discord and even then I am careful about where I go (only on one or two servers where I personally trust the owners).
[02:11:06] <biys> he knows about encryption.  but doesn't understand PKI
[02:11:21] <causative> signal is end-to-end encrypted, probably secure
[02:11:28] <audrey> And I suppose IRC, if you want to count that. But no Farcebook or Twitter or anything.
[02:11:45] <biys> causative: who hold the keys though?
[02:11:50] <biys> iirc signal holds the keys
[02:11:52] <causative> you do
[02:11:55] <causative> and the person you're talking to
[02:12:06] <I_Am_M00t> i installed it, but haven't used it yet
[02:12:24] <audrey> I thought about downloading a dating app but ... ugh that just seems so gauche
[02:12:36] <bittersweetsymph> They suck audrey
[02:12:39] <audrey> (and most people on dating apps seem to just be looking for screw-buddies ... but I digress)
[02:12:57] <bittersweetsymph> But then again, some people find their partner on them
[02:13:25] <causative> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)#Security
[02:13:25] <ro-bot-o> [url] Signal (software) - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[02:14:06] <causative> EFF, snowden, European Commission, WaPo, Guardian, NYT, WSJ all endorsed or used its security
[02:14:31] <causative> doesn't mean it is totally secure, but it's good
[02:14:45] <causative> also released under GPL
[02:14:56] <audrey> biys: Your friend might have a point though when it comes to difficulty finding a mate
[02:15:25] <audrey> Rather paradoxically, with so much sexual and dating availability and options, you often end up with less choice
[02:15:29] <causative> the main reasons it might not be totally secure would be if someone used a supercomputer or a new algorithm to crack the encryption, or if there's a yet to be discovered bug in it
[02:15:52] <causative> but there's just as likely to be a bug in one of the *other* apps you're using, which would in turn compromise your Signal communications as well
[02:16:05] <bittersweetsymph> There are heaps of people but so unnatural way to meet someone
[02:16:40] <biys> audrey: i think that he needs to be frank with the women he talks to, and explain his motives.  i also think that he needs to be less superficial.
[02:16:41] <causative> so... it's not impossible for a nation-state attacker to read your Signal messages by first getting root on your phone, but that's not a very likely type of threat
[02:16:54] <audrey> Well, most men have transparent motives, no? :P
[02:17:10] <biys> causative: well... not really.  you do remember the issue with random number generators on old intel processors right?
[02:17:16] <biys> in which the "random number" was completely...  not random
[02:17:38] <causative> yes, it is possible that a nation-state would have compromised your phone hardware or software, in which case nothing you do on it could be secure
[02:17:46] <audrey> I almost went on a date with a man once and it was painfully obvious what he was after, and the more he tried to hide it the more obvious it was to me
[02:17:58] <audrey> until he became so creepy that I cut off all contact with him
[02:18:02] <causative> but relatively speaking, Signal is pretty secure
[02:18:10] <causative> about as secure as anything else you could possibly do from your phone
[02:18:16] <biys> causative: i was sure that the PKI was managed by signal and not the end users.
[02:18:27] <biys> but i'm probably wrong
[02:18:30] <audrey> And like, that's fine, but you can't make that your life's worth
[02:18:34] <causative> well, I'm sure Signal has your *public* keys biys
[02:18:41] <causative> that's not a security problem, they're called public for a reason
[02:20:59] <bittersweetsymph> Then you are on an insta-date with someone you never met if you chose to meet, some might act like you owe them if they paid for your dinner. It is a most strange way to meet. Then many are maybe trying to get as far as they can rather than get to know you.
[02:21:58] <bittersweetsymph> Some probably are trying to get as many racy pictures of women or bed as women  as they can too through dating apps
[02:22:12] <bittersweetsymph> So all fake anyway
[02:23:07] <bittersweetsymph> I think it is like they feel good in front of other men if they can get lots of women in bed from dating apps
[02:23:29] <bittersweetsymph> Anyway this is my observations even there are forums where they swap ideas on how to do it
[02:23:40] <biys> well...  tbh i can't really say which way or the other
[02:23:44] <biys> how we're "supposed" to be
[02:23:57] <biys> what i can tell you though...  if that there's lots of peopel out there telling you how to be
[02:24:02] <biys> chosing who to listen to is tough
[02:24:09] <bittersweetsymph> So any affection given may well be fake so they feel like big hero's in front of their mates rather than anything sincere
[02:24:11] <biys> choosing
[02:24:25] <bittersweetsymph> I don't know what percentage that is but the pua people target those apps
[02:24:38] <biys> bittersweetsymph: exactly.  not only that but i don't think people are even sure what they want anymore
[02:24:43] <biys> i think that the water is so muddy
[02:24:47] <biys> people have no clue where they're going
[02:24:49] <biys> what they're doing
[02:24:49] <bittersweetsymph> I seen they share women's conversations on their put forums too
[02:25:04] <bittersweetsymph> Great atmosphere to try to find someone genuine in
[02:25:10] <biys> haha
[02:26:09] <bittersweetsymph> Put= pua
[02:26:39] <bittersweetsymph> So maybe you met someone who likes you or maybe you are the 76th woman he's trying to bed to be a hero to the other blokes
[02:26:56] <bittersweetsymph> Who knows
[02:27:07] <causative> that could also be true anywhere you meet them
[02:27:08] <bittersweetsymph> Dating in the 21st century
[02:27:28] <causative> when would you prefer to be dating?  1950?
[02:28:38] <causative> there wasn't any perfect time in history
[02:30:07] <biys> i knew you meant PUA
[02:30:20] <biys> what did you think about Roosh V ?
[02:30:26] <biys> what do you think of his transformation?
[02:31:00] <biys> What happens when a pickup artist suddenly receives God's grace after teaching a lifestyle of fornication for over a decade to a worldwide audience? American Pilgrim is a 350+ page memoir that shares my first-year journey upon deciding to repent from a life of evil to serve Jesus Christ. I travel across the United States to deliver my testimony in person through a series of lectures while chronicling the
[02:31:06] <biys>  temptations that attempt to bring me back to Satan, the spiritual labors that deepen my faith as a new Christian, and the lamentable state of America on the cusp of great upheaval.

[02:43:13] <audrey> I mean, him being a religious zany is still better than being a rape apologist

[02:52:59] <bittersweetsymph> There was a man on a dating app that said he was married and messaged me, I told him planey why doesn't he just be faithful to his wife. Then I went back on the dating app some years later, messages me again, I just block/delete. So a fair portion of the men on there are cheating on their wives. I read that statistic in the news. Yeah find a man, get married, then he can cheat on you with dating apps.
[02:54:34] <bittersweetsymph> Some of them also are dping it to test women on the fake so they can say, "see women are bad..I found 3 lonely women in this town ready to let me cheat on my wife...women are so bad" they do those posts on their forums
[02:54:58] <bittersweetsymph> Guess they don't think being fake and messing with women is bad though

[03:04:13] <bittersweetsymph> Actually I went back on a dating app the other day and that same guy messages me, "I remember you." I did not reply.
[03:04:53] <bittersweetsymph> So after years he doesn't reflect on how I might have viewed it I guess.
[03:05:02] <bittersweetsymph> Meh..oh well
[03:05:48] <bittersweetsymph> Probably even has a gf even though he is on there and is still bombarding women woth photos of his wang

[04:07:25] <biys> tbh though
[04:07:26] <biys> about that
[04:07:37] <biys> i don't really see how someone wouldn't know they are being cheated on
[04:07:46] <biys> it seems like there would be a significant disconnect in the relationship for that to happen
[04:08:06] <biys> i know i'm not entirely mindful and in a lot of situations lack emotional intelligence
[04:08:26] <biys> so i'm not saying it's impossible or even suggesting it to mean any kind of lacking characteristic in a person
[04:08:35] <biys> but if you're being cheated on for a long time...
[04:08:43] <biys> i wonder how much of a willnig participant you are in it

[06:36:58] <amigojapan> I see Delf . Yeah, altho I don't think that is a universal definition of "dating"
[06:38:05] <Delf> Perhaps it's not. Just seeing things the way I do
[06:38:16] <amigojapan> Which to be is more like going out with someone of the opposite sex to enjoy a movie or a dinner or something together

[09:49:41] <evolv> and kmh!
[09:49:53] <evolv> I think that's everyone I see in the recent chat history
[09:50:02] <evolv> a few comments on romantic love
[09:50:26] <evolv> 1. It's optional
[09:51:26] <evolv> 2. The difference between romantic love, a close family member, and a best friend are slim
[09:52:37] <evolv> 3. Whatever makes "romantic love" "romantic" will and should disappear. A partner will eventually become both a family member and friend who is your roommate and do sexual things with (some people do not)
[09:53:22] <evolv> so loneliness is not caused by absence of a romantic love partner
[09:54:29] <evolv> loneliness can be addressed by having a good set of friends, but it can also be addressed by learning how to completely enjoy your own company
[09:54:56] <evolv> and if you can completely enjoy your own company, it makes the company of others all the better

[11:43:12] <evolv> mnemon, nah
[11:43:26] <mnemon> yah
[11:43:54] <evolv> it's only one of a plurality of sensual desires
[11:44:33] <mnemon> it's a biological imperative
[11:46:02] <evolv> given a choice, would you sacrifice AC and heat for the rest of your life for sex?
[11:46:49] <mnemon> life would be very short without heat
[11:47:10] <evolv> let's say you only get enough heat to live
[11:47:14] <mnemon> we had about a week of -10 to -20C
[11:47:35] <mnemon> and no AC to begin with :o
[11:48:00] <evolv> imagine being without AC near the equator by sea
[11:48:06] <evolv> in the summer
[11:48:16] <mnemon> anyways, possibly
[11:48:23] <mnemon> sex keeps you warm too :o
[11:49:03] <evolv> good luck getting aroused when you only have enough heat not to freeze to death
[11:49:48] <evolv> also, have you never passed up sex before?
[11:49:49] <mnemon> I'd imagine it would only be better, only time beyond sports when you'd feel warm :o
[11:49:52] <evolv> ever?
[11:50:02] <mnemon> sure
[11:50:17] <evolv> yeah
[11:50:45] <mnemon> but not a lot unless there are some unrelated reasons blocking it
[11:51:20] <evolv> I've passed up on sex a lot just because I didn't feel like doing all of that work
[11:51:32] <mnemon> maybe ensured some advances never lead to it if the other party was not of interest
[11:52:03] <evolv> years ago I had this friends with benefits
[11:52:11] <mnemon> maybe it's more to do with the expectations of you or the partner
[11:52:18] <shea> "Imagine being without AC near the equator by the sea". We needn't imagine, it happened for centuries.
[11:52:23] <evolv> since that's how we became friends, I remember just wanting to get the sex out of the way so we can watch shows together and chit chat
[11:52:24] <mnemon> just having a quickie doesn't consume much effort
[11:52:38] <evolv> eventually she was done with the sex, too, and just wanted to hang out
[11:52:55] <evolv> sex does get boring
[11:53:30] <mnemon> going through grand motions does
[11:54:06] <mnemon> anyways, a lot of individual variation wrt that
[11:54:19] <mnemon> but for teens it's almost invariably a major thing
[11:54:38] <evolv> yeah, and in the US, at least, so is getting a license and a car
[11:54:41] <mnemon> thus pretty good candidate for "essence of man"
[11:55:09] <evolv> there you go, it's more of a signifier than an energy

[20:33:32] <causative> the meaning of a complete situation to an agent pursuing an objective, is the value of the objective derived from that situation.  For example, if the expected discounted reward from a situation x is R(x), then the meaning of x to the agent is R(x).
[20:33:55] <causative> the meaning of a complete situation reduces all the data in that situation to a single value, the objective value.
[20:36:17] <dispersed> meaning of life is reinforcement?
[20:36:19] <causative> the meaning of *part* of a situation describes how that *part* of the situation *affects* the objective.  This can be summarized by a function meaning(x) = λy . R(x + y), where "+" is an operator that combines two parts of a situation to form a complete situation.
[20:37:15] <causative> so that, for example, suppose an agent is sitting in a chair. The meaning of sitting in the chair, to that agent, consists of how "sitting in a chair" can be combined with other conditions to produce different objective values.
[20:38:13] <causative> e.g. "sitting in a chair suspended from a chain over a lava pit" would yield a low objective, "sitting in a chair in front of a pile of a billion dollars" would yield a higher objective.  The way that "sitting in a chair" combines with other conditions, in a way relevant to the objective, is the meaning of "sitting in a chair."

[21:07:14] <biys> it is unlikely i would find, in your description, utopia
[21:07:22] <biys> we're different people, so our wants and needs and desires are different
[21:07:54] <biys> i don't think we can necessarily summarize a single utopia for the entire world population inclusively
[21:08:11] <biys> i wouldn't say it's hypocrisy either
[21:08:36] <biys> if i asid i want utopia, and you came to me describing "utopia"... just because i don't want YOUR utopia does not make me a hypocrite
[21:09:38] <biys> they also seem to make claims about the perceptions of others surrounding the ``ideal utopia''
[21:10:03] <biys> i feel dumber having read this article
[21:10:05] <biys> no offense
[21:13:35] <causative> very well, go ahead and describe a specific utopia you would support
[21:14:46] <biys> from what position?  egalitarianism?  national socialism?  or just my lazy, self indulgent idea?
[21:16:12] <biys> i don't think utopia implicitly suggests any kind of social construct
[21:16:23] <biys> it's more-so just one ``ideal'' dream state
[21:16:33] <biys> where you m ight be a-sexual i might by hyper-sexual
[21:16:39] <biys> (this is just an example)
[21:16:59] <biys> so to suggest that getting laid every day would be involved in the necessary utopia would be lost on you
[21:17:25] <biys> lets also assume i'm currently extremely well off
[21:17:35] <biys> and have no significant burdens associated with money
[21:17:43] <biys> my utopia would likely be signifiacntly different than yours
[21:17:54] <biys> the frame of mind is associated with the utopia and it's formulation
[21:18:02] <causative> this still sounds like you criticizing utopias rather than describing a specific utopia you would support
[21:18:31] <biys> well.  as JBP says.  it is unlikely i could formulate a utopia i would want for any specific length of time
[21:18:48] <biys> it might be what i want right NOW
[21:18:56] <biys> but odds are my perspective and opinion would change with time
[21:19:01] <biys> and a new utopia would emerge
[21:19:32] <biys> so formulating a utopia would be relative to the goals i'm attempting to achieve.
[21:19:58] <biys> getting laid, getting high, driving a fancy sports car
[21:20:19] <causative> it also sounds like you aren't talking about utopias at all

[21:21:02] <causative> a utopia is an ideal form of society overall
[21:21:05] <biys> i tend to think of a utopia as an imagined place where everything is ``perfect''

[21:24:01] <causative> not "get a fancy sports car for me," but organize society in a way that people in general benefit
[21:24:15] <biys> When we talk about _an_ ideal world, we are quick to talk in terms of the usual things that we would say are good for a society overall
[21:24:42] <biys> i think you're reading a bit much into what the article is presenting
[21:24:58] <biys> a perspective of utopia is still an individualistic idea
[21:25:27] <causative> that's what you say, not what Hanson is saying
[21:29:51] <biys> not really.  i mean... he's describing the disconnect between a utopia as described and someones desire for it
[21:30:27] <biys> But our allegiance to such a utopia is paper thin, and is primarily to a utopia described in very abstract terms. Our abstract thoughts about utopia generate very little emotional energy in us, and our minds quickly turn to other topics.
[21:30:55] <biys> if it wasn't ``described'' it would be ``imagined''
[21:32:06] <biys> they also seem to be making a lot of declarations about what people think
[21:32:31] <biys> And so when the subject of utopia comes up, framed abstractly and hypothetically, we first react with our far minds: we embrace our abstract ideals.
[21:32:51] <biys> so when you start talking about your utopia
[21:33:02] <biys> it's framed within the context, in my mind, of what i think utopia is
[21:33:08] <biys> not your description
[21:33:17] <biys> as you continue to describe it, it is unlikely i would find utopia in your description
[21:36:23] <causative> when Hanson says utopia he is talking about an egalitarian society without conflict, and he says that our "near" minds rebel against the concrete prospect of this, because such a society lacks the element of conflict that would let us rise socially above others
[21:36:38] <causative> he's not talking about you having a fancy sports car
[21:37:14] <causative> read the article again if that's not what you got from it
[21:42:46] <biys> my having a fancy sports car would be associated with the idea of a utopia
[21:43:07] <biys> it's just a general example that goes to show that your idea and my idea of utopia are not the same

[21:43:16] <biys> so when we talk about ``utopia'' it is likely we're not even talking about the same thing
[21:43:40] <biys> so it is unlikely when you're describing utopia, i'd enjoy yours
[21:44:11] <biys> i think the disconnect in the article is assuming that people will have the same description of utopia
[21:44:31] <biys> i mean
[21:44:36] <biys> it says it in the first sentence of the article
[21:44:43] <biys> Our book The Elephant in the Brain argues that there are often big differences between the motives by which we sincerely explain our behavior, and the motives that more drive and shape that behavior.
[21:45:33] <biys> then the second paragraph goes on to explain it further.  the hypocrisy is associated with what we believe we're currently lacking
[21:45:41] <biys> but once we've been given that... it will change
[21:45:46] <biys> and the primary motives will be lost
[21:45:59] <biys> unless you're suggesting this article doesn't stand on its own
[21:46:10] <biys> and i need to read the entier works of robin hanson to understand this article
[21:46:16] <biys> in which case... sure.  whatever you say
[21:47:36] <biys> the first comment in the comment section seems to suggest the same thing
[21:47:40] <biys> I don't deny the data, but I think it's because utopias can only seem utopian when vaguely described. Any discussion of details reveals the unacceptable price we pay for any specific utopia, and we rightly recoil.
[21:49:06] <biys> notice that all of this seems to be associated with a _description_
[21:49:10] <biys> not an _idea_ of utopia
[21:49:44] <biys> But the more concrete the discussion gets, and the closer to asking for concrete supporting actions, the more we recoil. We start to imagine a real society in detail wherein we don’t see good opportunities for our personal advancement over others.
[21:49:48] <biys> "the discussion"

[22:07:59] <causative> if Hanson's notion of a utopia allowed for concepts like "I have a fancy sports car faster than everyone else's" then his point would not make sense.  "Utopia isn’t a world where you can justify much conflict, but conflict is how you expect to win, and you really really want to win. And you expect to win mainly at others’ expense"
[22:08:08] *** Joins: Treefingers (~Glassbox@34.162.189.80.dyn.plus.net)
[22:08:58] <causative> throughout the article he consistently talks about utopia as a form of society beneficial for all, not one that places you above others or lets you beat down on others, even though you do want those things with your near-mind
[22:11:16] <causative> in general it's a good idea to interpret the terms in someone's argument in such a way that the argument makes sense
[22:11:26] <causative> instead of interpreting them in your own way, or in a contrary way designed so that it does not make sense
[22:13:38] <audrey> biys: I recall reading TMB at one point. An odder combination of fresh opinions and utterly batshit bloodlust there never was.
[22:14:35] <audrey> I used to think it was fortunate deranged people like this were never let anywhere near the levers of policymaking or enforcement, but I'm not so sure anymore.
[22:15:56] <audrey> There is this weird thing in radical-feminist spaces (not sure to what extent TMB is a radfem) where women will project extremely violent rhetoric
[22:16:41] <audrey> The underlying assumption being, as best as I can discern, that women need to compensate this or that problem with additional, stereotypically-masculine aggression.
[22:17:31] <audrey> biys: But yes, despite all of that, it is relevant today, I agree.
