[00:10:12] <Khorne> Seems like theres been a failure to initialize the GPU
[00:10:17] <th0rne> I guess so.
[00:10:18] <th0rne> I have Ryzen 5, the one without graphics, so the GPU is pretty important.

[04:51:41] <leonic> I have no idea why it has a usb 3 port when it can't get over a few MB/s.

[04:56:04] <leonic> yeah, when I connect the drive to my pc, I get over 300 MB/s.
[04:57:12] <leonic> but even if it was usb 2, it should still tranfer at 25~30 MB/s
[04:57:33] <famus> yeah. weird. firmware all up to date on the router? 
[04:58:33] <leonic> firmware version is V5.50(ABPY.1)b16_20210525, so I presume 25 May 2021
[04:58:47] <Namarrgon> nothereisnotanam: systemd-boot does directly boot the kernel, which happens to be an efistub
[04:59:18] <leonic> but I found that other people also have extremely low usb tranfer speeds with the same modem/router.
[05:00:50] <famus> like random internet people on Windows? That would be my next test.. if it's a weird thing going on with the linux SMB interface or whatever
[05:01:19] <rcf> Keep in mind that the router is probably using an (old) version of Linux itself.

[05:02:39] <leonic> yeah, random people on Windows
[05:03:20] <rcf> The point being that barring a weird Samba bug, there shouldn't be much of an implementation mismatch at play.

[05:05:05] <rcf> rip
[05:05:31] <leonic> I put the drive in the usb 2 port and the transfer speeds are the same. 2 MB/s read, 1 MB/s write.
[05:05:34] <SponiX> Namarrgon: when I look at the wiki on systemd-boot it is overwhelming. If I wanted to switch from grub to it, is there a chance you could give me a break down of what I need, and leave out all the rest ?
[05:06:02] <rcf> leonic: unfortunately that means they probably aren't selecting it for its excellent SMB performance with a USB hard drive 
[05:06:12] <leonic> hahahah
[05:06:39] <rcf> Probably just stops at "what will make them complain about the Internet being broken the least?" 
[05:06:54] <leonic> it's so shit, it's unusable to stream videos from
[05:06:58] <famus> if it's any consolation my fancy new ISP supplied router advertises that I can plug in a USB drive and it becomes my home file server.. but the reality is that it does absolutely nothing when I plug any USB in
[05:07:28] <rcf> leonic: ADSL has a way of doing that in the modern age
[05:07:30] <leonic> famus: maybe it only accepts exfat formatted drives?
[05:07:38] <SponiX> Namarrgon: scratch that, instead of having you spoon feed me. I'll do some Google-Fu and see if anyone has a "quick and dirty" type guide on it
[05:07:56] <SponiX> I'm a bit old for the flying spoon
[05:08:00] <famus> is exfat the same as fat? I gave it various fat drives
[05:08:21] <leonic> rcf: oh, the internet itself is pretty good. 100 mb/s down, 30 mb/s up.
[05:08:27] <earnestly> famus: nope
[05:08:33] <leonic> famus: no, exfat is a new format.
[05:08:35] <SponiX> famus: nope, there is FAT(fat32), exFAT, FAT16 and so forth
[05:09:08] <SponiX> with the new kernel 5.16 ntfs support -- it might be the bestest option now, not sure
[05:09:19] <rcf> SponiX: this is a router, you are not getting anywhere near a modern kernel 
[05:09:21] <famus> and a newer router might only take exfat? I'll try that
[05:09:43] <rcf> famus: it's part of the SD card spec, for example. 
[05:09:49] <SponiX> rcf: lol ... I always wondered why routers use REALLY OLD kernels
[05:10:08] <SponiX> rcf: Samsung is at least getting last gen LTS kernels on their phones, routers are like just Wow

[05:10:32] <leonic> maybe yours is the same.
[05:10:52] <leonic> another thing is mbr vs gpt partitioning. your router might not support gpt.
[05:10:59] <rcf> SponiX: they want vendor-supplied out-of-tree modules to work, and Linux actively makes this very difficult to keep up to date. Way too much effort for companies who already have your money to bother.

[05:15:06] <leonic> but with the new in-kernel ntfs3, I thought about formatting them ntfs so I could share them between dual-boot windows/linux.
[05:15:51] <leonic> f2fs has less features than btrfs and I think many android phones already use it a while.

[05:18:04] <leonic> it does compress the files and you can get like 70 MB/s through usb 2, but the space that is saved isn't accessible.
[05:18:44] <famus> welp. I did not expect to ever bother with that again but thank you gents. I now I have a semi-pointless 8GB network drive attached to my router.
[05:19:01] <leonic> it works? :-o

[06:59:42] <Namarrgon> do you have a separate /boot fs?
[07:00:07] <Scimmia> If you had GDM installed, you already had mesa, so all it would have done was reinstall it. That isn't what caused this
[07:00:34] <GoKritz> Yeah, grub is installed to a secondary partition

[07:01:15] <GoKritz> Yes
[07:01:30] <Namarrgon> was it mounted when you update the kernel package the last time?
[07:01:47] <GoKritz> Maybe not
[07:02:03] <Namarrgon> check what is in the /boot directory when the /boot-fs isn't mounted
[07:02:47] <GoKritz> Was going to check my fstab, but I'll do that too 
[07:03:28] <Scimmia> is this a pretty new installation?
[07:03:37] <GoKritz> Somewhat, yes
[07:03:41] *** Joins: raym (~raym@user/raym)
[07:04:01] <Scimmia> then it could also be that grub was configured without the /boot partiiton mounted
[07:04:10] <Scimmia> either one would cause what you're seeing
[07:04:38] <GoKritz> So yeah, there's a lot of kernel stuff in my /boot folder and my boot partition isn't mounted
[07:05:14] <Namarrgon> is /boot listed in the fstab?

[07:06:00] <Namarrgon> you installed grub twice?
[07:06:19] <GoKritz> No, just mesa I think
[07:06:31] <Namarrgon> did you actually look for the grub directory or are you assuming?

[07:10:33] <gh555222> 'as good'?
[07:10:34] <Namarrgon> GoKritz: so then the real kernel is probably on the separate fs. clean up the crap in the /boot directory, mount the /boot-fs and reinstall the kernel.

[07:11:13] <GoKritz> Okay. No idea why this happened. Thanks guys
[07:11:33] <Scimmia> GoKritz: did you do a pacman -Sy at some point with all of this?
[07:11:39] <GoKritz> Haha yeah
[07:12:05] <Scimmia> so what happened is that you did a partial update. You updated mesa only, which broke everyting
[07:12:27] <Scimmia> so then when you went to fix it from the live disk, you updated everything, but didn't have the /boot partition mounted
[07:12:32] <GoKritz> el0
[07:12:58] <GoKritz> Welp... I didn't know i had mesa already. I was sort of just following instructions from the wiki
[07:13:10] <Scimmia> don't use -Sy unless someone that really, really knows what they're doing tells you do. Mostly from the news on the front page
[07:13:46] <GoKritz> Oh wait no, I was doing -Syu

[07:14:06] <GoKritz> OK, then no
[07:14:07] <dirtcastle> gh555222, in terms of packages and no of bugs? are they essentially same and all packages & bug fixes in x86 just get ported to arm? 
[07:15:55] <gh555222> dirtcastle, I don't think bugs are 'severe' smaller less disturbing bugs may still happen, especially with "higher-tech" software which has arbitrary dependencies but most of your "core" and "lower tech" softwares should work just fine
[07:17:22] <dirtcastle> gh555222, that helped thanks.

[13:59:02] <grawity> ideally, they *don't* enable them by default

[13:59:47] <Ghosthree3> or sockets
[13:59:48] <grawity> but if you really want to, the official-est mechanism would be to 1) put the .service in /usr/lib/systemd/system, 2) ship a systemd .preset file that says "this unit should be enabled", 3) call systemctl preset in your post_install
[14:00:08] <grawity> no, huge majority of services in arch packages are disabled by default
[14:00:18] <Ghosthree3> sure, but there are some that aren't?
[14:00:23] <grawity> rarely
[14:00:33] <grawity> some sockets are "statically enabled" which doesn't allow sysadmin to disable them

[16:34:48] <grawity> depends on where those references are found
[16:34:57] <grawity> sometimes it's harmless, sometimes it breaks the program
[16:35:13] <grawity> because it thinks its config file is /home/tian/.cache/pacaur/foo/etc/foo instead of /etc/foo 
[16:35:44] <grawity> (e.g. caused by mixing up whether $pkgdir goes in PREFIX= versus DESTDIR= in some build systems)

[16:36:08] <grawity> what else does it contain?
[16:36:11] <tianruiwei[m]> However, when I remove the `${pkgdir}`, the mkdir would fail

[20:02:21] <kuhilas> Can't get audio from headphones I plugged into this laptop. I have a hdmi cable plugged to a TV and using the tool asoundconf I have set that one the default audio source and it works ok. I haven't installed pulseaudio to this arch installation. In alsamixer there are two devices, the HDMI and the realtek alc236 (laptop's internal) and none muted. I tried now setting back the alc236 as default using asoundconf `asoundconf set-default-card 1`
[20:02:21] <kuhilas> but I still hear audio from HDMI. Tried restarting web browser and reloading youtube video but still

[21:12:11] <blaub> nah
[21:12:33] <NetSysFire> give in, try systemd timers
[21:12:34] <Biswa96> In lib2geom package, should not the ragel & gtest be in makedepends?
[21:12:50] <armin> also say about manjaro what you will, but this "Breath Dark" theme is godlike. i had to steal that one.
[21:13:09] <NetSysFire> if its just the theme its fine
[21:13:32] <armin> it's seriously good, it fixes all the problems i had with the standard breeze-dark kde theme.
