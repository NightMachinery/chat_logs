[00:06:41] <ProfSimm> flakland: Hawking radiation causes them to lose mass, but two things 1) this radiation is not fully confirmed yet 2) it's very, very slow. As in the universe may die before the holes dissipate this way
[00:07:45] <flakland> i mean, could it be absorbing gravity from it's surroundings, and then shedding that as radiation

[00:17:25] <ProfSimm> Guest19: a set that is a true set wouldn't have two members that are "equal" yet distinct somehow. So what you describe is semantically equivalent to the set ignoring duplicates

[00:19:17] <ProfSimm> Well, as noted, in set it doesn't make sense to have two values considered "equal" and yet one to replace another as if they're not equal somehow.
[00:19:41] <ProfSimm> It's like replacing the number 5 with the number 5 in the set of integer numbers
[00:19:50] <ProfSimm> It's like you didn't replace anything at all
[00:19:58] <Guest19> It's a SET. Of course it doesn't have two equal values. It would essentially move the existing member to the end, as if it was inserted last.
[00:20:24] <bjs> Guest19: just call it OrderedSet
[00:20:30] <bjs> I think the semantics you give is the obvious one for an ordered set.
[00:20:45] <Guest19> It's not ordered. It preserves insertion order...
[00:20:54] <ProfSimm> If we wanna be oddly specific we can call it TemporallyOrderedSet

[00:56:15] <Decker> technically we're always hitting the ground
[00:56:32] <mrig> Been pondering realistic space flight emulation, tricky for a game as it is so hard to get to grips with, we're so oddly dependant upon gravity and the atmosphere that its hard to imagine flight that is not bound by both.

[00:57:17] <Decker> mrig stepping from that to just rotation vectors is next... it becomes super easy to add the reltive accelartions based on your orientation
[00:57:25] <ProfSimm> Daemonick: it has no reason to collapse unto itself, EM moves in straight lines. It curves when space is curved by... more EM
[00:57:41] <InPhase> ProfSimm: When you run into a brick wall, your running motion is formally stationary from your own reference frame, so from a minkowski metric perspective the wall is in your future.  And then you hit it.

[01:57:06] <sub0> [itchyjunk], it will be amazing if you never tried it before
[01:57:13] <arahael> There are definitely significant concerns there, macaw.
[01:57:18] <[itchyjunk]> macaw, no need to signin with facebook anymore, just sign in with meta :>
[01:57:27] <[itchyjunk]> yeah i've never tried it before
[01:57:33] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: It's sign in with facebook.
[01:57:34] <macaw> Oops. s/Am/Am I correct in thinking that the past was more innocent?/
[01:57:36] <[itchyjunk]> i've seen some of those sleezy games in steam
[01:57:52] <oldlaptop> macaw: (Not really.)
[01:57:52] <[itchyjunk]> i thought facebook signins changed to meta signins
[01:57:54] <sub0> I think you can now have just oculus account, without facebook. I don't care to be honest, I don't use facebook, and created one just for quest
[01:57:55] <mehwork> if i "sign in with facebook" to a service like Spotify, does that create a brand new user account in spotify that won't have my playlists from signing in different ways?
[01:57:56] <[itchyjunk]> or will soon be the case
[01:58:30] <[itchyjunk]> mehwork, if you have a sing in with email then use sign in with facebook
[01:58:34] <arahael> sub0: You could use an oculus account and still can for a short time, but they are phasing that out.
[01:58:36] <[itchyjunk]> those will be discinct, at leat that's how it was
[01:59:02] <[itchyjunk]> From what i hear, all account will be a "meta" account
[01:59:07] <[itchyjunk]> for any meta related products
[01:59:29] <oldlaptop> arahael: I don't quite understand the motivation behind that. Are they having that much trouble recruiting users for facebook now? (That doesn't pass the sniff test, from the outside)
[01:59:46] <arahael> But you can also go with HTC Vive, etc.  Trouble for me was I didn't have a compatible PC.  Well, I do have several computers, but VRChat doesn't work on macos, and my x86 system runs linux.  VRChat does work on linux (via a custom build of wine, basically), but I don't have a sufficiently powerful graphics card for it.
[01:59:59] <arahael> oldlaptop: Meta _is_ facebook.  They bought Oculus.
[02:00:01] <sub0> arahael, that's old news, new one is that they will change facebook requirement policy. but I haven't followed it closely, so I don't know if it ended up being true

[02:00:27] <arahael> sub0: Ah, I'm not sure what the future plans there are, then. But they're definitely phasing out the legacy oculus account.

[02:02:15] <[itchyjunk]> i am not sure what that is about
[02:02:19] <mehwork> every time you 'login with meta' (or facebook, or apple or anything) does it create a brand new SSO session, remembering nothing from the last time you logged in?
[02:02:41] <nomagno> Facebook has pulled the rug and now it's a choice between expensive device or spyware device
[02:02:44] <arahael> mehwork: No. It's pretty persistent.  I have Facebook Messenger in the Quest, as well, everything.
[02:02:46] <macaw> [itchyjunk]: It tires you out much quicker than regular gaming. IDK why.
[02:02:54] <macaw> But it does
[02:02:58] <macaw> .*
[02:03:01] <oldlaptop> arahael: I still don't see the point: if they don't make it a hard requirement, how many people will go to the trouble of using a different (disposable) email, or taking some other action that could actually prevent them from obtaining the data they want?
[02:03:04] <arahael> macaw: Oddly enough... I find VR tires me _less_ than regular video chat.
[02:03:06] <[itchyjunk]> sensory overload maybe?
[02:03:12] <nomagno> macaw: Because you actually move, probably
[02:03:17] <mehwork> arahael: that makes sense, otherwise my spotify playlist would get deleted every time i signed in as SSO
[02:03:17] <[itchyjunk]> arahael, i think he meant for games

[02:03:38] *** Quits: TCZ (~tcz@91.150.178.124) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:03:41] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Yeah, just for me I was exploring VR as an alternative to video chat.
[02:03:46] <sub0> it is subjective, but for me teleporting (or any similar type of unnatural movement) causes dizziness. physically walking and moving around causes no dizziness at all for me
[02:03:58] <nomagno> I don't even know what to do with my Quest now
[02:04:00] <[itchyjunk]> oh interesting
[02:04:05] <arahael> sub0: That's an interesting point.  I'm physically unable to experience dizziness.
[02:04:05] <oldlaptop> If Bob Smith signs up for Oculus with bobsmith@bigmail.com, and for Facebook with bobsmith@bigmail.com, it is a reasonable inference that the one on Facebook will respond to ads targeted according to the activity of the one on Oculus.
[02:04:13] <nomagno> It's a Quest 1, I essentially can't sell it at an acceptable price.
[02:04:16] <[itchyjunk]> i heard that your depth perception is fucked which causes dizzyness
[02:04:17] <macaw> arahael: Hehe, video chat is it's own beast too. Indeed.
[02:04:34] <[itchyjunk]> you think something should be this deep and you try to touch it and its more or less "deep" in te VR
[02:04:37] <oldlaptop> Requiring that Bob use the Oculus through a Facebook account, specifically, instead of through something notionally separate, doesn't appear to buy them much.
[02:04:38] <[itchyjunk]> and that causes dizzyness
[02:05:00] <[itchyjunk]> it buys them a new ad platform
[02:05:03] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: No, depth is fine in VR
[02:05:05] <[itchyjunk]> which is what they were going for
[02:05:11] <nomagno> The issue is the motion sickness
[02:05:17] <arahael> nomagno: My suspicion is that the "premium" VR stuff is still going to be non-Oculus.
[02:05:38] <nomagno> The disconnect between your inner ear and your movement is what makes you dizzy most of the time
[02:05:40] <arahael> Oculus, in general, is "limited".
[02:06:03] <[itchyjunk]> 3D perception is a common cause of dizzyness for perscription glass users
[02:06:05] <oldlaptop> [itchyjunk]: How so? (I'm not going to copy/paste my second-to-last message.)
[02:06:10] <macaw> oldlaptop: Maybe they are thinking a couple steps ahead.
[02:06:11] <[itchyjunk]> any time you change your glasses, they warn you about this
[02:06:15] <arahael> nomagno: Yeah, my inner-ear is broken, hence no dizziness as I don't use the inner ear. :)
[02:06:21] <nomagno> arahael: Hasn't really been true for a while, at least since SteamVR wireless clients with sub-20ms license came out
[02:06:23] <macaw> Planning for future "features" and the like.
[02:06:30] <nomagno> Latency*
[02:06:37] <[itchyjunk]> oldlaptop, at some point, fb had promised "integrated VR" ads as a revinue source for app maker
[02:06:48] <[itchyjunk]> so if i am making a vr app, i can display fb ads and make money
[02:06:55] <[itchyjunk]> if not, why should i make an app for occulus?
[02:07:06] <[itchyjunk]> fb had made several promises along this line to devs at some point
[02:07:06] <macaw> oldlaptop: They don't have to nag you into creating a Facebook account - you already have it! Convenient.
[02:07:17] <nomagno> Because the Quest is a game console.
[02:07:25] <oldlaptop> macaw: Hence my original question: are they having that much trouble recruiting Facebook users already?
[02:07:27] <nomagno> Literally everyone treated it as such, even Facebook
[02:07:30] <ProfSimm> I think Facebook's attempt to make a "metaworld" around Oculus will fail because people still need to live their lives, and chatting with your phone on the go is much more attractive than mounting a device on your head that blocks your vision.
[02:07:34] <oldlaptop> I didn't think that passed the smell test, offhand.
[02:07:36] <[itchyjunk]> oldlaptop, it's not about recruiting fb users
[02:07:41] <[itchyjunk]> its about recruiting app makers

[02:08:17] <macaw> oldlaptop: It's all about squeezing the lemon till the last drop, I think.
[02:08:26] <nomagno> I think they have no excuse for putting ads into their games
[02:08:38] <oldlaptop> [itchyjunk]: It is also a reasonable inference that the person signed into the Oculus account as bobsmith@bigmail.com will respond to ads targeted based on the Facebook activity of the account registered to bobsmith@bigmail.com.
[02:08:43] <[itchyjunk]> the excuse is to pad their revinue?
[02:08:45] <nomagno> The revenue model isn't optimal, nor common, nor comfortable for the user
[02:08:50] <sub0> I'd hate if I started seeing ads in the games I paid for
[02:09:01] <apotheon> I think a lot of people are going to end up with rapidly deteriorating vision if the current VR approach really catches on too much, for too long.
[02:09:02] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: Except padding their revenue.
[02:09:07] <[itchyjunk]> lol
[02:09:16] <apotheon> just to throw a rock in the pool without having paid much attention to the discussion
[02:09:20] <[itchyjunk]> well fb doesn't seem to be the type to care about anything other than bottom line
[02:09:30] <oldlaptop> The explicit, obvious connection to a Facebook account is *not* necessary for ad targeting in the overwhelmingly common case.
[02:09:32] <sub0> apotheon, is there any evidence that VR causes vision problems?
[02:09:36] <FloridaMan> apotheon: or a toaster
[02:09:38] <macaw> oldlaptop: If you didn't want to make a Facebook account till now, but you're too poor to buy a Valve Index, you *have to* get squeezed. Granted, this is an uncharitable view, but I feel justified, as we're talking about a proven-uncharitable company.

[02:11:27] <apotheon> Still, a meter isn't all that much.
[02:11:54] <[itchyjunk]> VR is temporary, BMI will be the winner!
[02:12:09] <apotheon> It's recommended that people who sit in front of a computer look at things 20+ feet away (about six meters) for a few minutes once in a while, for instance.

I have a friend who uses her quest 1 (actually a pre-release dev kit), and it's... Ok....  But for sign language what we're really after is better controls.  Eg, maybe sign language *gloves*.

[08:26:39] <KillerWasp> MsFoxyEmilySmith: In programming it is complete enough so that you do not miss anything. By programming I mean C/C++/ASM, of course. The rest are toys.
[08:27:11] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> you can memorize an algorithm or even do minor variations to solve 'novel' problems but
[08:27:19] <akP7QstK> Algorithms are not useful if one cannot use them.  Mathematics and programming are two different things.  One might know an algorithm yet be unable to program it.
[08:27:21] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> very very few invent their own

[08:34:07] <flakland> C is barbaric
[08:34:23] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> C taught me something tho
[08:34:38] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> I still dont 'know C' like the elitists in #c but
[08:34:48] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> it taught me everything is just a loop

[13:50:06] <smallville7123> which makes for an extremely simple implementation however it makes it impossible to change without it breaking, eg if you remove the decay the redstone basically becomes self-powering

[13:54:21] <smallville7123> there is a lot to implement

[13:54:41] <pyzozord> right, yeah the detection mechanism seem kind of tricky to implement
[13:55:00] <smallville7123> thats relatively easy

[14:13:39] <mrig> smallville7123 I did ask you what vanilla redstone was a little earlier on but that was I think lost in the flow of the chat.

[14:15:00] <deniska> pyzozord: I lately feel even promises/futures are not enough. Python's library called `trio` has an interesting mechanism called "nursery". Any coroutine you run is tied to a nursery, and exiting a block of code in which you declared a nursery is a blocking operation, waiting for all coroutines to finish
[14:15:15] <smallville7123> it is basically decay probogation, specifically ping-pong decay probogation

[14:37:39] <deniska> matrox: string splitting is a very non-trivial operation
[14:37:45] <vdamewood> matrox: Because adding reuirements to the standard library wil inflate its footprint, and reduce the number of systems on which a program could run.
[14:37:49] <deniska> matrox: (when it comes to C level of abstraction)
[14:38:00] <smallville7123> heh https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-run-a-PC-without-RAM-and-if-so-how-do-I-do-it

[14:39:09] <smallville7123> "Oh, it could be used - but you‚Äôd have the world‚Äôs slowest computer." lmfao
[14:39:11] <matrox> vdamewood, you are not making any sense. it would only be an issue MAYBE on the smallest of microprocessors, and they have a separate C standard, standalone vs whatever it is called
[14:39:46] <vdamewood> matrox: 'freestanding', and it's not a separate standard, it's part of the normal C standard.
[14:39:55] <matrox> deniska, nonsense. it is very trivial, just pass the state that is currently global and reentrant. it is trivial update to current strtok
[14:40:01] <Twix> a ordinary intel computer can run without ram installed. But you need to modify the bios/firmware quite a bit
[14:40:09] <matrox> vdamewood, right, freestanding. so your point makes ZERO sense
[14:40:21] <Twix> *an
[14:40:23] <matrox> and non-reentrant*
[14:40:41] <mrig> vdamewood I did find the cl.exe too, which I can just pull out and use in the future, apparently the teacher stops using VS a little later on in the series.
[14:41:03] <vdamewood> mrig: In favor of what?
[14:41:09] <mrig> Have it at a sensible size now, it just did not occur to me that it would be using so much space.
[14:41:31] <matrox> vdamewood, even on freestanding implementations your point makes no sense. it wouldn't use any more resources. you could even simulate current strtok behavior by making the state you pass to the new function global
[14:41:56] <mrig> vdamewood I think by then that the debugging is done with tools that are self made inside of the environment. But that is speculation.
[14:42:19] <matrox> funny that #c agrees that the function is horrible and should have an alternative, but C weenies in #programming defend the current state
[14:42:40] <mrig> why would an IDE need 20G or more, the thought had simply never occurred to me.

[14:44:05] <matrox> deniska, that is rich coming from a python weenie. the only way to make python perform faster than a dying turtle is to use a C library, or write the code in C yourself
[14:44:12] <mrig> because it is lighter and more responsive than emacs and someone made it to be and easy swap, again still speculation, I'm only on day 108

[14:44:42] <smallville7123> heh
[14:44:50] <smallville7123> ‚ÄúAll this process happens through BUSES designed on motherboard that connect CPU and RAM as required.
[14:44:50] <smallville7123> So replacing RAM with HDD means to replace those circuits and add same instructions to ISA that once worked for RAM but now should work for an HDD.
[14:44:50] <smallville7123> OS must also be changed accordingly and the memory management functionality inside OS would be implemented on hard drive.‚Äù
[14:45:18] <deniska> matrox: sure, we python weenies are looking forward for using rust libraries instead of C libraries :P
[14:45:20] <vdamewood> mrig: The other 19.2 is stuff like Libraries, the compiler, and other tools.

[14:51:45] <deniska> vdamewood: well, mac is not a PC, it was like the main slogan of their ad compaign :)
[14:51:51] <vdamewood> my problem with that definition for a 'PC" is that it took an industry standard, general term, and hijacked it for some specific series of computers.

[14:52:15] *** Joins: Chanakan5591_ (~Chanakan5@user/chanakan5591)
[14:52:33] <deniska> Was PC ever a general term?
[14:52:40] <vdamewood> A PC used to be a computer designed for use by a single person at a time.
[14:53:14] <vdamewood> So, The Apple 1, and 2, the Atari ST, the Comodore PET and 64, were all PCs.
[14:53:22] *** Quits: Chanakan5591 (~Chanakan5@user/chanakan5591) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:53:36] <deniska> I thought the term was "home computer"
[14:53:49] <epony> PC is a term since the late 70ies
[14:54:05] <GeDaMo> There were other personal computers which weren't home computers
[14:54:07] <epony> and are business computers
[14:54:38] <epony> home computers are what you call all-in-one, toys, consoles, appliances, handhelds, video-players etc
[14:55:02] <epony> and some controllers in your washing machine, oven and television set
[14:55:06] <vdamewood> Then IBM came and called theird the 'IBM PC' relying on their name 'IBM' for the trademark protection and then the clone makers just started saying they were 'PC's to indicate they were compatible with IBM's PC.

[14:58:11] <deniska> Anyway, it wasn't a general term for like 40 years at this point :)
[14:58:12] <epony> so technically the 6502 were amateur level computers intended for work and home use, and were indeed personal because they had no internal storage and had persistent ROM programming
[14:58:27] <epony> it was a general term
[14:58:43] <epony> it was used as "personal computers for business"
[14:58:58] <pyzozord> ugh so annyoing to work on mac and linux at the same time!

[14:59:03] <pyzozord> I keep pressing the wrong keys
[14:59:13] <epony> mac is not standard ;-)
[14:59:15] <pyzozord> in both the mac and the linux
[14:59:16] <deniska> I mean at this point (nowadays) it's no longer a general term since ibm pc successfully coopted it
[14:59:24] <epony> (so technically not a computer, but an appliance like a computer)
[14:59:50] <vdamewood> deniska: Yep, and we don't exactly have a usable replacement term for it anymore.
[15:00:01] <epony> IBM was selling computers much before the micro-computers which is the actual term.
[15:00:03] <vdamewood> deniska: 'Desktop' excludes laptops. For example.

[15:00:28] <vdamewood> epony: Actually, a micro-computer is not the same thing as a personal computer. Though all personal computers are mciros.

[15:01:39] <deniska> pyzozord: the answer for "why doesn't go do this thing in a better way?" is "because google never needed that"
[15:02:06] <epony> vdamewood, micro-computer applies to form factor and class of machines, and is a historic shrink (miniaturisation) from mini-computers with only a subset of features and capabilities originally so were not business ready
[15:02:19] <pyzozord> deniska: yep, that's probably it. I admit that my whining about 1.7mb virtually empty binary is a bit pointless
[15:02:21] <epony> so, no
[15:02:25] <epony> a server is a role
[15:02:28] <pyzozord> at least if you are doing modern pcs
[15:02:39] <epony> while a micro- is a class of machiens
[15:02:44] <deniska> vdamewood: there're two axes really to categorize computers on. How many people you need to carry it, and how often do you carry it in normal circumstances
[15:03:06] <epony> and personal and desktop are marketing hype, like "cloud" and "productivity"
[15:03:20] <vdamewood> epony: A microcomputer is a computer with a microprocessor. A microprocessor is a processor with all of its logic on a single IC.
[15:03:20] <deniska> Servers might not be that heavy to carry alone, but still, you shouldn't :D
[15:03:37] *** diophantoz is now known as comptuer_mastar
[15:03:46] <epony> vdamewood, yes, that is because of minuaturisation of integrated circuitry
[15:04:10] <vdamewood> epony: What I'm saying is that any system with a microprocessor is a microcomputer.
[15:04:16] <epony> but it is the result of mainframe to mini-computers to micro-computers classification
[15:04:35] <epony> vdamewood, that seems to be a correct definition
[15:05:13] <vdamewood> So, since a computer can be designed to be  a time-sharing or other type of multi-user system, then not all microcomputers are personal computers.

[15:50:29] <vdamewood> (The bank switching would put another SRAM chip in there. Or I could just use a 64k SRaM chip in the first place.)

[17:21:18] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I mean it's still lazy, everything in Haskell (unless specified otherwise) will be lazy.  But like I say if you have an operation that needs to evaluate the lhs (e.g. +) then to get the value from foldl you'll have to evaluate down the "stack" of computation to get the result.

[17:26:55] <[itchyjunk]> great
[17:26:57] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: the problem with foldl and infinite lists is that `foldl f v [1..]` is that you get "(((v `f` 1) `f` 2) `f` 3) ..." so when you come to actually evaluate the value you need to unwind to the "end" to apply the outermost function
[17:26:57] <nomagno> Rust has pretty much a cult following in some aspects, if you look at the basic premise of the ecosystem: replace everything else

[17:28:06] <mishugana> [itchyjunk]: theoretically, the main difference is that foldl calculates "along the way" while foldr has to "hold on" to values

[17:33:18] <[itchyjunk]> i can't handle books
[17:33:18] <matrox> [itchyjunk], it is a good next step. you basically wrote foldl manually yesterday with mylistReverse
[17:33:22] <[itchyjunk]> hence this random learning
[17:33:41] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, folding over a list like adding the elements of a list or somesuch?
[17:33:44] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: but lots of things in Haskell are general, e.g. there's a generic "map" that works over trees and lists and all sorts (called <$> or fmap)
[17:33:46] <[itchyjunk]> what else is common?
[17:33:52] <matrox> [itchyjunk], reverse = foldl (flip (:)) []
[17:33:58] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well folding over a tree is just traversing the tree as if it were a list, right?

[18:00:09] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well,  the answer is going to look like `foldl (?) 0 [1..n]`  where you replace the ? with your own function :)
[18:00:32] <bjs> that function is probably going to have some squaring and some adding in it somewhere too
[18:00:38] <[itchyjunk]> i can think of a bunch of solutions involving map lol

[18:01:06] <matrox> btw, to get the same behavior as haskell's filter, foldr has to be used over foldl
[18:01:08] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well, can you not do the squaring inside the function ... ?

[20:43:07] <InPhase> epony: The wiki page?
[20:43:18] <InPhase> epony: I read it.  I also happen to have used data-oriented design for decades in my computational work, and I do it WITH oop.
[20:43:18] <InPhase> epony: I've seen some of these videos.  What I see is people designing incorrect data structures for the access usage they need, and then blaming the paradigm instead of the design architecture they chose.
[20:43:21] <epony> you need very precise compact data structures that deliver for you constant CPU load / saturation / throughput / predictable calculations and sustained data rates pumped through your caches
[20:43:30] <epony> that's the real world, systems with engineering constraints
[20:43:31] <epony> yeah
[20:43:41] <InPhase> epony: The problem is not OOP.  The error is people thinking that OOP objects must reflect real world objects, and thus people try to make games where the objects all line up with game objects instead of data structure architectural needs, and then they fail to achieve architectures with needed performance.  But "object" is an abstraction, not necessarily a real world entity.
[20:43:57] <epony> InPhase, I don't know what you do ;-) but good luck
[20:44:16] <epony> OOP is not efficient for tight and performance computing
[20:44:44] <InPhase> epony: What I do is a lot of high performance computational work with OOP, which it excels at when you design for performance.

So associating data and methods is certainly a part of it, but you can do that just by arranging functions and data structures near each other in code and naming them similarly.  The key thing that differentiates OOP from that is encapsulation, where you can define an interface for your data which provides certain guarantees or invariants about allowed state that the collection of data 
[21:12:54] <InPhase> will have, and relationships that will be sustained between the data by the interface.
[21:12:55] <pulse> i've read one article that said it's simply implausible to have virtual offices because the screens look like crap
[21:13:07] <Rounin> Hm well... That's now, though
[21:13:15] <Rounin> Surely that could be overcome
[21:13:28] <Rounin> And for things like modelling... Say you
[21:13:30] <pulse> i think it said it would require like 10x better resolution and still look worse than a normal screen
[21:13:32] <Rounin> you're building a new house
[21:13:39] <Rounin> Ah... Quite a lot
[21:13:42] <pulse> yeah, i can see it being useful in specialized environments
[21:13:45] <pulse> architecture, and stuff
[21:13:47] <InPhase> epony: If you are encapsulating your data and providing invariants on those encapsulations, you are doing OOP whether the objects correspond to real world collections or not.

[21:17:43] <InPhase> pyzozord: Imagine a simply guarantee like the length stored for a string should match the number of characters it has in it.  If you have encapsulation, you can guarantee that every operation that works on these two pieces of data preserves this relationship.
[21:18:06] <epony> you do not need that
[21:18:19] <InPhase> pyzozord: If however you can modify these two bits of data directly with higher level logic, then the WHOLE program is responsible for preserving this relationship, rather than a local set of tested functions.

[21:26:29] <Rounin> It used to be more common than functional, though I don't know what the case is now
[21:26:36] <epony> that's just the UI of programming

[22:12:06] <epony> programming is the implementation of the tooling that you then use for your "theoretical trials"
[22:12:34] <epony> so you're creating a layer of abstraction to make it easier for you to use the mathematical tooling
[22:12:54] <InPhase> epony: If you're not familiar with the notion of invariants or how it works in OOP, then I recommend studying it before continuing to throw out OOP as an approach.  It is quite empowering to the construction of large software architectures to be able to robustly lock down behavior with layers of invariant guarantees.
[22:13:30] <epony> but that does not mean you are programming functionally, or that it computes, it means you're playing with that "frontend you just created without being able to prove to you the frontend works for actual computation"
[22:13:51] <epony> InPhase, so.. seems like we've wasted each other some time here ;-)

[22:15:03] <InPhase> epony: The front end that you're discussing is the whole game of programming.  The reason to use various programming approaches is because it empowers engineering designs which allow us to guarantee certain behaviors with high confidence in ways that one cannot get by just wildly typing out a series of machine code instructions.

[22:15:36] <epony> see this:
[22:16:00] <epony> In the 1980s, fifth-generation languages were considered to be the way of the future, and some predicted that they would replace procedural programming with constraint based programming for all tasks that could be framed as a series of logical constraints.[3] Most notably, from 1982 to 1993, Japan[4][5] put much research and money into their fifth-generation computer systems project, hoping to design a massive computer network of machines using these 
[22:16:00] <epony> tools. 
[22:16:00] <epony> However, as larger programs were built, the flaws of the approach became more apparent. It turns out that, given a set of constraints defining a particular problem, deriving an efficient algorithm to solve it is a very difficult problem in itself. This crucial step cannot yet be automated and still requires the insight of a human programmer.
[22:16:41] <epony> of course, that was for modelling quakes
[22:16:57] <InPhase> Yes, constraint-based programming was largely a misguided notion.
[22:17:09] <epony> what is functional programming then ;-)
[22:17:15] <deniska> programming with functions
[22:17:26] * epony begins to chip away at the false reality that some people build in their minds
[22:17:50] <InPhase> But it was based on the observation that constraints are essential to robust programming.  What one needs is to be able to more explicitly specify behavior while still upholding constraints.  This is why OOP took a dominant position in language design, because it actually does this.

A dictionary can be represented as a set of exposed properties on an object "foo.bar", or as a method on the object where you pass a key foo.get('bar'). Is there a way to combine the autocompletion benefits of the former and the clarity of the latter (so we can have other methods than get/set)
[23:20:25] <ProfSimm> epony: all those paradigms overlap. They're not the future or the past, IMHO. They contain absolute elements of system design mixed-in with happenstance and opinion, as no one knows the whole truth, if that even exists.

[23:23:01] <deniska> ProfSimm: if a language also provides something like "symbols", like in clojure, then it looks like (foo :bar)
[23:23:04] <ProfSimm> deniska: indeed. I'm trying to figure it out conceptually before I consider syntax. The main difference to me, it seems to be that with "foo.bar" you need to expose the set of members of foo, and select one of them, while with the latter you're kinda walking in blind, not being sure if that member name you pass in exists.

[23:23:30] <deniska> and symbols also act as functions which look up themselves in the mapping (:bar foo)
[23:23:53] <deniska> ProfSimm: if a list of keys in a mapping is static, it's better of to be a custom class/object imho
[23:23:59] <deniska> off*
[23:24:27] <ProfSimm> deniska: I think you're narrowing in on the nature of what I'm thinking about. I have symbols, yes. And the "which comes first" is an issue
[23:24:29] <vdamewood> hey, EdFletcher, if you buy electronic components often, maybe you can help me with something.
[23:24:55] <vdamewood> EdFletcher: Question 1: Are you in the US. If not US, Canada? 2: Where do you buy from?
[23:25:32] <ProfSimm> deniska: the problem is if foo(:bar) is get and foo(:bar, value) is set, then what about all other methods, like "iterate all keys" or "unset" and so on and so on
[23:26:09] <EdFletcher> vdamewood: i've not been buying much of anything recently (for the obvious, unfortunate reasons) but if i can help i'd love to! 1. US 2. for hobby, aliexpress; for work, mouser or digikey (usually the former) 
[23:26:14] <ProfSimm> deniska: we could have symbols for them like foo(:delete, :name) but then collision occurs, what if i wanna store the :delete symbol as a key
[23:26:15] <deniska> ProfSimm: just because you have foo(:bar) doesn't prohibit you to have foo.unset(:bar)?
[23:26:43] <epony> and someone earlier interjected with the "purpose of programming", we'll come back to that point later
[23:26:45] <ProfSimm> deniska: hmm in general it doesn't prohibit me, but only if I "multiply concepts" by making functions also records.
[23:27:03] <deniska> ProfSimm: think operator() in C++ or __call__ in python
[23:27:12] <epony> since it's much more interesting than say the "paradigm" or "preferred style"
[23:27:13] <deniska> it's kinda the other way around, records are also functions
[23:27:16] <vdamewood> EdFletcher: Interesting. I've only ever bought electronic components from one place, ever, it was Mouser (back when every order came with a Phoneboo... Catalog.)
[23:27:38] <ProfSimm> deniska: sure but how'd you implement the dot operator on a function. Maybe have :dot symbol... foo(:dot, ...) and we're back to the collision problem :)
[23:27:59] <vdamewood> EdFletcher: FWIW, it was an NVRAM chip the SparcStation IPX used to store things like firmware config and MAC address.
[23:28:05] <ProfSimm> deniska: this is like the joke "you can solve any problem in computing by adding another layer of indirection". I'm trying to avoid indirection
[23:28:11] <EdFletcher> vdamewood: well then you luckily landed on one of the best on your first try üòÜ  we love mouser, their prices are always competitive (sometimes digikey will be lower but generally not by significant amounts) and they ship crazy-fast 
[23:28:25] <EdFletcher> vdamewood: oh very interesting! do you have a specific part number? 
[23:28:45] <epony> ..as for functional, the real argumentation is the search of practical advantages, so it's a deeper point, than just contradiction
[23:28:53] <vdamewood> EdFletcher: No, unfortunately. It was so long ago that I only remember that it was a NatSemi design.
[23:29:53] <ProfSimm> epony: in my hoby project (a language of some sort) I had to introduce pure functions simply so I can calculate them at will (even as you type them) without risking side-effects or non-deterministic answers. So that is a benefit
[23:29:54] <vdamewood> EdFletcher: Apparently the ones in the SS IPX had a tendency to die, and when I got it it was already a 10-year-old system.
[23:30:02] <EdFletcher> vdamewood: no worries totally understandable... i'm betting it - or a generic stand-in - is available somewhere, very likely from a smaller chinese mfg, aliexpress is a _great_ place to start looking (but you would need to have some pointers... i'll see if i can dig anything up!)

[23:39:17] <epony> ProfSimm, so the actual point is, we have to intentionally search for the very large and very small areas of application of a high level programming language to find it's failure in the apparatus (model), and for a language family like LISP that is "all other languages in part" and "none of everyone one of them fully" is just pushing to the realities of predictable, reliable and secure (shared / concurrent / hostile) compute
