[02:30:56] <Joanna> Hi grobi thanks for link
[02:31:14] <grobi> hi Joanna :)
[02:32:11] <Joanna> It has been rather quiet lately
[02:32:31] <grobi> ?
[02:36:28] <jan6> it always is
[02:38:10] <grobi> did we passed 'high noon' again?
[02:38:40] <Joanna> High noon as in showdown?
[02:39:43] <grobi> :D
[02:39:48] <Joanna> I was listening to a podcast last night and the guest said that russian isn’t the independent entity that people make it out to be
[02:40:43] <Joanna> Russia
[02:42:26] <grobi> Link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59402658?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA
[02:46:38] <Joanna> Sometimes both sides of a conflict are encouraged by the same people though
[02:47:40] <Joanna> And the arms business is very profitable
[02:48:16] <grobi> absolutely
[02:51:04] <Joanna> Some say that hitler and russian revolution were backed by same people
[02:51:45] <Joanna> _inky: any insights ?
[02:53:32] <grobi> what definitely does not unbind anyone from any guilt..
[02:54:23] <grobi> war and drugs are the biggest business
[02:54:54] <grobi> Q: "Stupidity makes us rich"
[02:58:58] <Joanna> The funny thing about drugs is if you say I refuse to use any drug not even coffee people still aren’t happy

[02:59:33] <grobi> who cares what people say
[03:00:55] *** Joins: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap)
[03:00:59] <Joanna> Because what they say indicates what they think which in turn leads to what they will do..
[03:02:10] <grobi> i read an interesting book in the 80's about the correlation of drugs and war, which made my mind up about drugs at that time.. 
[03:03:25] <grobi> since then this correlation grew exponential
[03:03:26] <Joanna> They like to decide that some drugs are legal and some are not. They don’t like all drugs lumped into one category then refused..
[03:04:24] <Joanna> They advertise all sorts of drugs non stop and then people take them and suffer the consequences
[03:06:11] <grobi> especially the money earned with chemical drugs has brought lot of suffer to this world aside from the suffer coming from this drugs in general
[03:07:34] <Joanna> And for profit private prisons for people who use other drugs
[03:08:35] <grobi> https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051017-103748
[03:14:11] <grobi> this one is about the use of in wartimes https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/war-and-drugs-toxic-relationship
[03:28:20] <jan6> 01:28 <Joanna> The funny thing about drugs is if you say I refuse to use any drug not even coffee people still aren’t happy
[03:28:34] <jan6> seeking happiness in other people is wrong approach from the start ;P
[03:35:50] <Joanna> grobi: that was an interesting link
[03:36:56] <grobi> yeah and there are lots of interesting articles there
[03:37:34] <Joanna> jan6: I’m definitely not seeking happiness from pushers of drugs or drug addicts. The thing about people who get addicted to drugs is they would be better off if they never discovered the drug to begin with. I know someone addicted to coffee..
[03:37:56] <grobi> i have to sleep now and wish you both a good night :)
