[00:00:18] <humanBird> what does registry:2 do?
[00:00:33] <programmerq> registry:2 is the docker registry software to run a docker registry.
[00:00:39] <Manouchehri> humanBird: makes the registry twice as cool.
[00:00:47] <Manouchehri> serious answer: it's v2 of the registry software
[00:01:19] <humanBird> oh.  I thought this was the name of an image you want to store in a registry and the other part of that command was just to start the server.
[00:01:26] *** Joins: gamara (~gamara@2607:fea8:1e5f:8df0:5003:89bd:3f03:918f)
[00:01:50] <programmerq> nope, 'docker run' will create and start a container, and the value you provide as the image will be used as the image for said container.
[00:01:56] <humanBird> ok. so this registry image that i see from docker images is some service that is running that allows me to push/pull images to and from local?
[00:02:38] <programmerq> yes, normally you'd do additional setup by supplying configuration values by a config file or env vars so it behaves the way you want it to. Additionally, you'll probably want to introduce some TLS certs and auth mechanism.
[00:03:00] <programmerq> once you have dns and well trusted certs and auth set up, then you can push images to your registry.
[00:03:36] <humanBird> i'm probably not going that far.  i just need for my service.yaml to see the image on my local registry
[00:03:54] *** Joins: dfee (~dfee@12.207.156.194)
[00:04:30] <programmerq> what is a 'service.yaml' file in this context, and why would you want to set up a registry without going "that far" to actually set one up.
[00:04:33] <programmerq> ?
[00:04:44] <programmerq> what's the actual goal here? Why not use an existing registry if you don't want to set one up?
[00:04:58] <humanBird> service.yaml is the kubernetes deployment
[00:05:18] <programmerq> okay, so you want something to use an image-- why does that image need to be on a registry that you don't want to fully set up?
[00:05:20] <humanBird> i'm testing some thing out in kubernetes. i don't need a full registry with auth and all that stuff
[00:06:20] <programmerq> you can still use an existing registry to test things out with kubernetes if you don't want to set up a registry. it's arguably more work to get stuff to work with an insecure registry than to just get a free letsencrypt cert for it.

[00:06:54] <humanBird> how would it be insecure if it's a local deployment ?
[00:07:14] <programmerq> no cert == insecure
[00:07:30] *** Quits: Enitin (~Enitin@82.180.145.225) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[00:07:30] <humanBird> i'm just trying to see if this image i built from docker compose will get deployed by the deployment yaml.  i'm not exposing this registry to the public... or i don't think so.
[00:07:36] <programmerq> you have to convince docker to interact with a registry that doesn't have a trusted cert
[00:08:05] <programmerq> so you either need to do a self signed cert and install the certificate into your OS's trust store, or put it in the special place that docker looks for registry certs and restart docker
[00:08:18] *** Joins: Enitin (~Enitin@82.180.145.226)
[00:08:20] <programmerq> or you have to explicitly configured docker to access your insecure registry as an insecure registry
[00:08:24] <humanBird> you're saying that local pull push to this registry:2 won't work at all without the cert?
[00:08:40] <humanBird> why would i need a cert if everything is local?
[00:08:47] <programmerq> and then combine that with your kubernetes stuff, and those too will need to be able to be configured with your insecure registry too.
[00:09:16] <programmerq> because docker had the opinion that it shouldn't let folks shoot themselves in the foot and they made it harder to do the wrong thing than to do the right thing.
[00:09:23] <programmerq> local or not, unencrypted is insecure.
[00:09:47] <humanBird> this sounds like overengineering to me
[00:09:57] <humanBird> i'm not attempting to run a production thing. i'm testing something out
[00:09:59] <programmerq> nope, it's just modern computing.
[00:10:23] <humanBird> it is pretty much overengineered for my use case
[00:10:33] <programmerq> you're welcome to test it out, but you need to tell docker explicitly that you are okay with an insecure registry, along with all the container runtimes that you want to also access the insecure registry.
[00:10:55] <programmerq> your usecase would be serviced fine by just using one of the existing public registries that you can get a free account on.
[00:11:13] <humanBird> first, i need to research which one i would pick for production
[00:11:25] <humanBird> which is way too much time to invest in right now to TEST something
[00:11:46] <programmerq> you specifically said you just want to test something, so you wouldn't need to do the research for your production usecase-- you'd just need to pick one that will work for your test.
[00:12:15] <humanBird> whatever.  it's overengineered

[00:13:00] <humanBird> why not put a cert for your local web server when devleloping?  "it's insecure"
[00:13:14] <programmerq> stay away from firearms, sir. you seem to be very keen on being able to shoot yourself in the foot.
[00:14:16] <humanBird> i'm not going to use this local registry for anything but testing purposes.  And if kubernetes/docker requires that you configure things to be "all secure" or "not secure at all" with nothing in between, it sounds like engineering design failure
[00:14:17] <programmerq> although I do have to say that I love your username and it reminds me of the sub /r/birdswitharms
[00:14:40] *** Joins: Enitin (~Enitin@82.180.145.228)
[00:14:46] <programmerq> humanBird you simply need to configure docker to allow use of an insecure registry. it's not all or nothing-- you just need to opt in to it.
[00:15:02] <programmerq> and you need to configure every docker instance you expect to access the insecure registry to treat it as an insecure registry.
[00:15:28] <programmerq> it's not unheard of to do exactly that, but in my opinion it is generally easier to just grab a free letsencrypt cert since it takes a few minutes.
[00:15:37] <programmerq> but others are happy using the insecure-registry option
[00:16:28] *** Joins: LuxuryMode (uid91005@id-91005.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[00:17:27] <programmerq> or you can sign up for docker hub and use your 1 free repository for your test and then delete it when you're done.
[00:17:40] <programmerq> (delete the repository, that is)
[00:22:08] <ash_worksi> is part of the way people like to use secrets is that you can share them between containers?

[07:49:16] <blei86> now i have to figure out how this works with Elastic Container Service on AWS
[07:49:29] <blei86> i recompiled the kernel for Amazon Linux to have a special config so my code would run in the container
[07:49:44] <minimal> ?
[07:50:02] <blei86> i am running docker on amazon linux, to create a container that will be hosted in ECS
[07:50:16] <blei86> i modified the kernel of amazon linux so that my code could run inside the container

[07:50:41] <minimal> running docker *ON* amazon linux (physical/VM) or running a docker image/container based on amazon linux? 2 different things
[07:50:56] <blei86> i'm running docker inside of an EC2 instance running amazon linux
[07:51:04] <blei86> the EC2 instance has a custom kernel
[07:51:20] *** Joins: recyclehero (~alistar@ec2-3-127-140-208.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com)
[07:51:24] <minimal> and what's the relevance for your docker image/container?
[07:51:37] <blei86> the code in my container wouldn't run if not for the custom kernel
[07:51:52] <minimal> why? what is it relying upon?
[07:52:06] <blei86> https://criu.org/Linux_kernel
[07:54:12] <minimal> does ECS support CRIU?
[07:54:38] <blei86> no idea. but you can easily install criu in an aws-packaged amazon-linux container using yum
[07:55:02] <blei86> amazon linux doesn't not support it, but it doesn't support it out of the box
[07:55:42] <minimal> ok but earlier you said "now i have to figure out how this works with Elastic Container Service" whereas it seems its more a case of *if* it works, not *how* it works...
[07:55:51] <blei86> well its kind of a mix of both
[07:56:04] <blei86> i'm unclear as to how ECS works at all. is this like a linux kernel as a service for containers
[07:56:07] <minimal> not really, if it doesn't work then there is no "how"
[07:57:05] <minimal> its a way of running Containers as an alternative to Dockerd/Kubernetes/Nomad/etc
[07:58:13] <minimal> https://github.com/alessandrobologna/docker-freezer
[07:58:26] <minimal> "As it turns out, the current AWS Linux AMIs that are used by default in the cluster's launch configuration do not support the kernel features that are required by criu So, and this is not maybe for the faint of heart, here are some instructions on how to build a new kernel based on the last ECS AMIs."
[07:59:42] <blei86> perfect, i can use the instance i already created potentially
[07:59:44] <blei86> tx
[08:00:24] <minimal> I assume you're trying to "warm up" containers for "serverless" type quick operations?
[08:00:51] <blei86> yes
[08:01:10] <minimal> that's what AWS offer Fargate for - I believe that's what it does
[08:02:23] <blei86> i'm using lambda
[08:03:23] <blei86> does fargate support the equivalent of criu
[08:03:34] <blei86> in any case, fargate containers take forever to start up
[08:04:19] <minimal> haven't used either Fargate or Lambda but thought that's what they did (plus running on top of Firecracker for quick instance creation
[08:04:25] <blei86> i have not heard of fargate supporting checkpointing. docker checkpointing based on CRIU isn't in production
[08:05:04] <minimal> yeah CRIU in general has been around for a while but I've not looked at so far with regard to docker containers
[08:06:11] <blei86> lambda is a more expensive solution, with higher lowest latency, but you can get insta-scale.
[08:06:32] <blei86> without requesting a limit increase you can burst 500 invocations

[08:09:45] *** Quits: k8yun (~k8yun@user/k8yun) (Quit: Leaving)
[08:11:49] <minimal> I assume you're running interpreted-language based apps like PHP or Python, or something like Java as I would assume warming would make the biggest impact for them
[08:12:13] <minimal> compared to C or Golang apps
[08:12:25] <blei86> py
[08:12:39] <blei86> lambda has function warming in addition to what i'm doing
[08:14:29] <blei86> well it depends on your app for sure, but my approach is applicable to C and golang as well
[08:14:54] <blei86> you put your program into a loop after its loaded everything into memory and done whatever init, then dump it
[08:15:53] <minimal> I seem to remember IronFunctions several years ago did warming
[08:16:16] <minimal> is was an early Serverless service
[08:16:50] <blei86> for lambda function warming doesn't make as big of a diff as you'd like
[08:16:57] <blei86> it would probably cost them a fortune
[08:17:00] <minimal> ah, they called it HotFunctions: https://blog.iron.io/hot-functions-ironfunctions/
[08:17:45] <blei86> that corresponds to lambda function warming
[08:18:28] <blei86> which basically means the time it takes to read your container off of s3 and start it only occurs once
[08:18:46] <minimal> BTW do you pre-create pyc files in your Python images?
[08:19:07] <blei86> i used pyinstaller
[08:19:14] <blei86> you might try nuitka instead
[08:20:12] <blei86> actually you can forgo both technologies and just use strace.
[08:20:22] <blei86> in which case, yeah, you'd precompile to pyc
[08:21:21] <minimal> I just remember in the past generating pyc files at docker image creation time as I was running the containers read-only

[16:00:24] <konrados> In the symfony/docker/apache.conf there is this flag: ErrorLog /dev/stderr and now I'm not sure if the issue is with docker, php, or... something else.

[18:18:17] <vtx> hi folks, does anyone have any advice on how to investigate/debug when it seems to be the case that the `target` entry of my docker-compose.yml is being ignored? when i say ignored, i have a two stage dockerfile, the first stage is called dev, the second stage is called run. in my docker-compose.yml, i want to run a service in the dev stage, so i
[18:18:18] <vtx> specify "dev" as the target under build. when i run the service with docker-compose up, the service looks to be running the second step of my docker image, not the first? but i'm not sure how to investigate what's going on?

[19:13:27] <tabakhase> luva torrent likel not directly - but for browser sure - just bindmount a nginx or so
[19:13:49] <tabakhase> or you mean the webserver to serve the torrent?
[19:13:52] *** Joins: Enitin (~Enitin@82.180.145.223)
[19:15:26] <tabakhase> not sure youll find anything ready build... - but "building something" should be fairly simple... little bashfu in a entrypoint script and some of-the-shelf torrent server...
[19:15:40] <luva> I tried sharing over http via a webserver
[19:15:47] <luva> but the download fails after downloaded a few GB
[19:15:50] <luva> the file is 30 GB zip
[19:16:11] <luva> thats why I  thought maybe use torrent
[19:16:41] <tabakhase> what webserver? - and tried some downloadmanager or such that can actually "resume"? (note that webserver need to support that as well)
[19:17:55] <tabakhase> and just onetime you to you? why then http at all... scp? - with netcat (or rather socat) you can even manually "resume" :D
[19:18:26] <luva> because I want someone who isnt into tech to download the file
[19:18:31] <tabakhase> also, auth?
[19:18:44] <luva> I used nextcloud for sharing behind a reverse proxy with auth
[19:18:51] <luva> but it just stops after a while and fails
[19:19:12] <luva> probably a little interruption makes it stop, or i dont know what else could be it, I dont have a download limit in my configs
[19:19:51] <tabakhase> nextcloud and there like may be simple "time elapsed" on the php-proxy to the storage or something like this... checked its logs?
[19:20:27] *** Joins: liefer (~liefer@user/liefer)
[19:21:23] <luva> I checked but didnt find an error
[19:21:42] <tabakhase> but ye a bare nginx shouldnt have such issues -- basicauth/secret filename may be ennuf then too - and nginx will also "resume" just fine, even with just chrome i think - just some `docker run --name some-nginx -v /some/content:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -d nginx`
[19:21:54] <luva> alright will try that

[22:34:01] <blei86> but if you use Alpine Linux for a Lambda container for example, where does it get its kernel? you're only pointing to an ECR image https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-container-image-support/

[22:36:25] <DoofusCanadensis> that's really just providing the Alpine Linux package manager to install software for the container to use... the runtime kernel depends on the host the container is launched on
[22:37:14] <blei86> i'm not sure that's right
[22:37:42] <programmerq> lambda is a thing that runs a process. that can be a containerized process. if I wanted to run a non-containerized lambda thing like a python script, I don't need to ship a kernel with it.
[22:38:10] <blei86> i'm not sure that's right
[22:38:16] <blei86> "You can deploy your own arbitrary base images to Lambda, for example images based on Alpine or Debian Linux. To work with Lambda, these images must implement the Lambda Runtime API. "
[22:38:47] <programmerq>  yeah, the lambda runtime api is just an api, not a kernel.
[22:39:13] <programmerq> lambda calls your code and passes in some stuff and your code needs to understand that stuff to do what it's supposed to do.
[22:39:31] <blei86> i'm not sure that addresses the question?
[22:40:05] <programmerq> lambda's container image support just means that lambda can run a container image. container images don't have kernels-- they are pretty much just a tarball of the userspace tools and some metadata.
[22:40:26] <blei86> so what's on the backend, Kernel-as-a-Service?
[22:40:52] <programmerq> and since lambda already provides a kernel and other files to support the non-container-image workloads (like a python lambda script), I imagine they would use a similar approach for providing the kernel to the container-image workloads.
[22:41:44] <programmerq> it's just that your container image is also providing the rest of the user space components that will be visible to your workload, while the non-container-image python runtime has a python install and some python modules already installed.
[22:43:04] <blei86> well, I think this is bad news for me
[22:43:21] <blei86> I need specific capabilities to be provided by my kernel

[22:46:05] <ario> what's the best way to clean up all databases (basically nuke everything) without putting docker containers in a bad state? What happens currently is containers are running and when i nuke tables and recreate, other containers depend on those tables start throwing errors and get in a bad state
[22:46:41] <ario> i tried pausiing and unpausing those contaniers while i nuke but it still gets in a bad state

[22:50:20] <DoofusCanadensis> if your other apps die when the database gets changed under them, then they need to be stopped, not paused
