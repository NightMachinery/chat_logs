[01:04:30] <tpefreedom> Since replicant doesn't support 4G or 5G (and 3G is a dying technology), what is the next based (android-based, GNU+Linux distros often are not stable enough for normal users) mobile operating system?
[01:21:00] <Noisytoot> tpefreedom, How are GNU/Linux distros not stable enough for normal users?
[01:25:02] <tpefreedom> Well, the sstufff on the pinephone or librem 5 might be, but the librem 5 is waaay too expensive and the pinephone doesn't work on verizon unless (maybe) if you jump through a bunch of hoops.
[01:25:04] *** Joins: mer (~mer@190.92.33.204)
[01:25:33] <tpefreedom> GNU/Linux is great on the desktop but distros for phones just are not there outside of specific devices.
[01:25:35] <lightbringer> postmarketOS+phosh certainly has plenty of issues on the pinephone
[01:25:45] <lightbringer> and i can't even get sxmo to come back from sleep
[01:26:18] <lightbringer> (most issues may be hardware issues though)
[01:26:57] <Noisytoot> tpefreedom, US carriers are weird. unlike carriers in other countries, they have 2 incompatible 2G and 3G standards
[01:27:30] <Noisytoot> but I think verizon also uses LTE (4G)
[01:27:57] <tpefreedom> Isn't 4G support on replicant still very much in development?

[01:32:53] <tpefreedom> Until GNU/Linux distros for phones get wider hardware support, I think I'll just use customs roms (possibly replicant if it gets proper 4G or 5G support).
[01:33:12] <Noisytoot> verizon is weird: "Even if a device supports some or all of the required frequencies for this carrier, it will not be able to connect unless the device is approved for this network. Check with the network operator to confirm whether a device is approved or not. "
[01:33:35] <Noisytoot> tpefreedom, the hardware replicant currently runs on will never support 5G
[01:33:53] <Noisytoot> (I don't know about 4G, but 5G uses different frequencies)
[01:35:24] <tpefreedom> Maybe I'll switch to something like lineageOS or /e/.
[01:37:39] <Noisytoot> Why use verizon?
[01:39:46] <tpefreedom> That's what my family uses (I'm still in hs.)
[01:42:58] <Noisytoot> Is there any reason for your family to all use the same carrier? (my family all uses different carriers (EE, O2, and 3))

[15:29:47] <GoatAvenger> You can't put the genie back in the bottle; unfortunately.  Red onions, appear to me, to be obviously purple; but, they are called red onions.  GNU/Linux or GNU+Linux is an overly nice corrective for something that was outright stolen.  Semantics are far more important than most people will lend credit too; but, most people aren't interested in the Truth.
[15:31:30] <GoatAvenger> I think the most appropriate term is GNU with Linux.  styled as GNU w/ Linux.  This gives the impression of a GNU system, 'with,' Linux, the kernel; and it's only one extra character to type and no extra sylables to say.
[15:32:10] <GoatAvenger> Or, GNU w/ kBDS, GNU w/ HURD, etc.. etc..
[15:33:47] <GoatAvenger> Then of course Debian, or Fedora, or Trisquel, or Parabola, are their own operating systems; so semantically, it's not wrong to just call them by their name.
[15:35:40] <GoatAvenger> I don't think it'd be wrong to say, they are GNU systems, GNU distributions, etc..

[15:36:08] <GoatAvenger> But I think that language comes more from the BSD world
[15:36:32] <DiffieHellman> Yes, just "Debian" is fine, but you should mention that it stands in full for; Debian GNU/Linux or Debian w/ Linux
[15:36:34] <GoatAvenger> They are, 'variants,' of, or, 'modified,' versions of, a GNU system
[15:37:16] <GoatAvenger> DiffieHellman, well yeah, I don't disagree with that, I didn't say it shouldn't; but, semantically, you aren't incorrect if you just call it the Debian operating system.
[15:38:02] <DiffieHellman> Precisely. You are only incorrect if you start naming many different operation systems after the kernel; "Linux".
[15:38:13] <GoatAvenger> You can't seperate that fact, you can try to conceal it; but, it remains the truth
[15:38:37] <GoatAvenger> Yeah, I'm not sure why people persist in trying to conflate Linux with the operating system.
[15:38:42] <GoatAvenger> but that brings us back to red onions
[15:39:03] <GoatAvenger> and how some people would rather believe in non-truths, than have their feathers rustled
[15:39:04] <kompowiec2[x]> GoatAvenger: now you have linux without GNU like android or alpine, so what the point?
[15:39:25] <GoatAvenger> well that's the android operating system
[15:39:31] <GoatAvenger> Doesn't change anything I've said.
[15:39:47] <GoatAvenger> it uses Linux, the kernel
[15:40:08] <GoatAvenger> It's not a GNU system
[15:40:23] <DiffieHellman> kompowiec2[x]: Yes, that's why it's important to just say you use "Alpine", or Alpine BusyBox/Linux in full.
[15:40:35] <GoatAvenger> at least as far as I know, it doesn't have any significant portions of a GNU system, I could be wrong..
[15:41:00] <DiffieHellman> The name "Android" doesn't result in any confusion whatsoever, so you can just call it Android. 
[15:41:07] <GoatAvenger> If you use BusyBox the Operating System, you aren't semantically incorrect to say either just, 'busy box,' or 'busy box w/ linux'
[15:41:23] *** Quits: cosimone (~user@2001:b07:ae5:db26:a7aa:8027:6b4e:2fb3) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:41:35] <DiffieHellman> Yup, when have I said that's not the case?
[15:42:01] <GoatAvenger> I think I thougth you were kompowiec2 for a second
[15:42:29] <GoatAvenger> I think I'm just saying the same thing you are..
[15:43:02] <DiffieHellman> You are.
[15:43:30] <kompowiec2[x]> > Yeah, I'm not sure why people persist in trying to conflate Linux with the operating system.
[15:43:30] <kompowiec2[x]> > but that brings us back to red onions
[15:43:30] <kompowiec2[x]> what the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve over
[15:44:07] <GoatAvenger> I celebrate the GNU system
[15:44:09] <GoatAvenger> personally
[15:44:19] <GoatAvenger> I think for some, it's an eye sore, because their motivations are different..
[15:44:37] <DiffieHellman> Yes, no matter what the proprietary mafia is saying, GNU has won.
[15:44:41] <GoatAvenger> or they want brevity in their speech, which is the genie in the bottle
[15:45:01] <GoatAvenger> that's linguistics
[15:45:05] <GoatAvenger> and I don't know a way around that
[15:45:20] <DiffieHellman> If they really wanted brevity, they could just say "GNU", which is slightly shorted to san.
[15:45:22] <GoatAvenger> can't put the genie back in
[15:45:23] <DiffieHellman> *say
[15:45:25] <kompowiec2[x]> Lojban :p
[15:45:35] <GoatAvenger> DiffieHellman, which is what should be done, I think, yeah
[15:45:55] <DiffieHellman> I slam the genie into the bottle every day on irc personally.
[15:46:01] <GoatAvenger> lol
[15:46:30] <GoatAvenger> Well, there's a difference between trying to battle the psychology of linguistics, and trying to espouse the truth
[15:46:40] <GoatAvenger> some people geniunely don't know about GNU
[15:46:52] <GoatAvenger> others do, and just say, 'Linux,' to refer to the operating system
[15:46:59] <DiffieHellman> Most users of GNU don't even know about it I reckon.
[15:47:41] <kompowiec2[x]> Because non-tech people they have no idea how libre software affects their lives
[15:48:16] <GoatAvenger> I'd wager that non-users of GNU who have, 'heard of Linux,' don't know about GNU; but, I'd say a healthy amount of the GNU users, eventually come to know what they are using, whether their vernacular points to it..
[15:49:41] <GoatAvenger> However, one thing that might help further elecudite what is often murky, is by having 2 viable kernels that can be used with GNU, in popularity
[15:49:59] <GoatAvenger> then people would be forced to realize that the GNU system can work with different kernels
[15:50:13] <GoatAvenger> and therefore Linux would be seen more as the kernel it is
[15:50:21] <kompowiec2[x]> just as you don't need to know about general relativity to use navigation
[15:50:37] <GoatAvenger> well, non-tech people know what an engine is
[15:50:41] <GoatAvenger> and that their car won't work with it
[15:50:48] <GoatAvenger> non-tech people can know what a kernel is
[15:50:54] <GoatAvenger> if it's popularized in the vernacular
[15:51:24] <GoatAvenger> but calling the OS, 'Linux,' doesn't help them, it's an effort to maintain ignorance, to favor the few who stand to benefit from it
[15:51:45] <GoatAvenger> and exploitation and maintenance of ignorance happens in all spheres, not just the tech world, to benefit the few
[15:52:43] <kompowiec2[x]> I once met a nurse who didn't even know what a gimp is.  I was shocked at the curse of knowledge.

[15:53:59] <GoatAvenger> it's easier to just let the road go unused long enough, that it starts to decay over time, and brush overgrows it
[15:54:15] <GoatAvenger> and that's done by just not further maintaining the road
[15:54:28] <GoatAvenger> whether people choose to continue to use it or not, is not something really in one's control

[18:09:26] <Noisytoot> <kreyren[m]> <TheCreeper> "To get the PinePhone working..." <- Why do you get a pinephone if you use a Sim card for calling on it..
[18:09:34] <Noisytoot> How can you make calls without a SIM card?
[18:09:50] <kreyren[m]> yes
[18:10:02] <kreyren[m]> e.g. using matrix for calls the element for phone is optimized for it
[18:10:13] <Noisytoot> element uses electron
[18:10:20] <kreyren[m]> as SIP is terrible protocol that is tracked and spied on
[18:10:29] <Noisytoot> GNU Jami
[18:10:32] <kreyren[m]> Noisytoot: fluffychat then or whatever client you like
[18:11:04] <Noisytoot> but if you don't have a SIM card, you need to always be connected to WiFi/ethernet
[18:11:18] <opal> < Noisytoot> How can you make calls without a SIM card?
[18:11:19] <opal> voip
[18:11:33] <opal> i'd still get a sim card for data when i cant use wifi
[18:11:40] <Noisytoot> ModemManager can't even enable the modem without a SIM card
[18:11:55] <opal> oh pinephone not android
[18:12:15] <Noisytoot> so you can't even use GPS without a SIM card unless you enable it manually (without ModemManager)
