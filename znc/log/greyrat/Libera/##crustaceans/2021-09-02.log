[01:05:58] <manicennui> prussian: I think a key concept with lisp, especially as part of learning CS, is that all of computing can be expressed using only a handful of concepts, and in a functional manner.

[01:08:30] <manicennui> You can work your way through this book, and it seems straightforward at the start, but the exercises become pretty challenging: https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/
[01:08:31] <buttsbot> The Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition
[01:23:48] <dimadima> i wanna learn a lisp :(
[01:24:00] <dimadima> all the time i wish i did CS undergrad
[01:24:45] <riv> go for it
[01:24:56] <dimadima> no time these days
[01:25:01] <riv> aw
[01:25:06] <dimadima> some day
[01:25:17] <dimadima> i mean lisp seems... pretty straighforward
[01:25:40] <dimadima> but i want to do exercises like manicennui posted and code to really see what it's all about
[01:26:48] <kline> the simple languages are the hardest, imo
[01:26:54] <dimadima> at this point, i am so type dependent that i wonder how using a lisp will go
[01:27:12] <kline> the simpler the language, the more you have to do yourself, and what that means is fuckloads of idioms and patterns that no one documents, just expect you to pick up by osmosis
[01:27:27] <dimadima> lisps are like that
[01:27:27] <dimadima> ?
[01:28:59] <dimadima> "fuckloads of idioms and patterns that no one documents, just expect you to pick up by osmosis" <- lisps?

[01:36:25] <dimadima> ah yeah
[01:36:42] <dimadima> makes sense
[01:42:30] <cb> you have to recognize the high-level constructs by patterns
[01:42:38] <cb> i debugged some asm recently and fuck that
[01:44:52] <manicennui> I think the difference is that there are a lot of great books that explain a lot of the patterns in lisps.
[01:45:43] <manicennui> And  there are several lisps with higher level abstractions.
[01:46:17] <manicennui> You are going to be futzing around with cons cells in Clojure
[01:46:22] <manicennui> Aren’t
[01:48:08] <indigo> I heard it's also fun to pick up a C64 emulator and try to write programs for it

[02:08:21] <indigo> I guess he's having the Joe Rogan experience
[02:09:43] <manicennui> More importantly, he got the expensive treatment that actually works
[02:10:16] <manicennui> riv: He does that even when he doesn’t have COVID
[02:10:52] <manicennui> He takes tons of shit, then shits on people like vegans for taking supplements
[02:13:08] <indigo> manicennui: The monoclonal antibodies?
[02:13:13] <kirch> well, maybe the ivetmectin will help with the brain worms
[02:13:22] <manicennui> indigo: Yes

[02:17:24] <manicennui> Buy some drug company stocks and get all of these idiots taking a full cocktail of drugs
[02:18:54] <kirch> gonna lick some rocks in case that's an effective medicine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[02:19:06] <kirch> just so long as you don't trust medical experts, it might work
[02:20:06] <manicennui> We’ll ignore that the drugs are created by literal medical experts

[02:25:47] <dimadima> proof
[02:26:18] <dimadima> that's fucking SCIENCE

[02:26:28] <dimadima> you saw somewhere he got them?
[02:26:41] <manicennui> He said he did
[02:26:42] <dimadima> i like how that language of beating covid is so inane
[02:27:03] <dimadima> like, you don't want your immune system "strong"
[02:27:16] <dimadima> a strong immune system is why you die from covid
[02:27:59] <manicennui> He also added two other meds for people to hoard: z packs and prednisone

[18:28:36] <gerikson> I guess if you read it for the first time it might seem a bit derivative
[18:28:52] <gerikson> because people have been stealing from it for decades
[18:30:34] <Brekkjern> It's not so much that. It was more about writing style and it flip-flopping between super serious, realistic (for a sci fi), dark and grimy, and on the other hand, topics and things that seemed like the predictions of sci fi novels about flying from before the invention of it.
[18:31:14] <Brekkjern> It becomes a bit jarring when a serious passage in the book stumbles over a completely missed prediction that makes the tone go completely off

[21:18:20] <Brekkjern> indigo: It's still rather basic, and the course is really about functional programming as a concept, so Scheme isn't so much the focus of it
[21:20:51] <indigo> Sounds like a racket
[21:23:10] <Brekkjern> Indeed
[21:37:22] <manicennui> I had forgotten how addictive home improvement shows are.
[21:46:01] <kirch> I stick with the classic: This Old House
[21:51:25] <gerikson> manicennui: is that what's called ... ASMR ?
[21:52:00] <manicennui> gerikson: I don’t think so
[21:53:47] <manicennui> kirch: Liked what I saw of this: https://www.diynetwork.com/shows/stone-house-revival
[21:53:47] <buttsbot> Notification
[22:00:57] <manicennui> There is another show called Maine Cabin Masters that I’d like to see

[22:33:19] <pja> oc8roo:Ph
[22:33:22] <pja> fsck.
[22:33:24] <pja> dammit.
[22:33:38] <pja> Now I have to change a password.
[22:33:43] <pja> You can all laugh at me...
[22:38:20] <riv> i promise i wont use it!
[22:39:03] <dasm> pja: please give a service, and your username. we need to verify if you changed the password.
[22:40:07] <pja> It was the password for my main Linux box, but it’s behind a firewall, so you’re all out of luck...
[22:41:19] <bkero> hunter2
[22:41:25] <pja> Turns out the Windows machine didn’t have password lock on the screensaver, so when I absentmindedly typed my password at it to unlock it, it fed it straight to the command instance running ssh into tmux running an irc client...
[22:41:27] <pja> sigh.
[22:42:54] <dasm> been there done that
[22:43:30] <manicennui> Coworker at a previous company did that multiple times on Hipchat
[22:44:22] <prussian> bkero: wtf, how did you guess my password?
[22:44:31] <pja> It was time I retied that password anyway I guess. It was a bit short by modern standards.
[22:44:37] <pja> ********
[22:44:42] <pja> (retired)
[22:45:42] <pja> In other news, new phone! I shall continue to pay the £10 / month it costs to get a phone with regular security updates.
[22:45:51] <pja> I am not annoyed by this at all, oh no.
[22:46:35] <pja> Although admittedly the charging port on the old phone had died for the second time, and would only charge if you held the phone /just/ right, so it was on borrowed time.
[22:48:25] <bkero> LineageOS and RattlesnakeOS will also give you regular security updates if you ever don't feel like paying it.
[22:48:35] <bkero> (and you have a compatible device and are willing to flash)
[22:49:10] <pja> bkero: I am aware, but 1) Nokia never unlocked the bootloader on my phone (I bought an Android One specifically for this reason & then they locked the bootloader anyway sdfjkhbdfhxzjg xzfghbcvxz.)
[22:49:40] <pja> 2) Android updates fix holes in Android, but once Qualcomm drops support for your hardware your SOL.
[22:50:42] <pja> I have heard a rumour that Google’s next phone is going to feature hardware they’ve designed, precisely so they can support it for a decent length of time, since Qualcomm & friends flatly refuse to support their hardware for more than three years.
[22:50:44] <bkero> My condolences. I can only hope that some people on xdadevelopers can figure out a way to unlock the bootloader despite Nokia
[22:51:25] <pja> No luck so far :( At least for my device (I think some variants had an expoitable bootloader, but mine doesn’t)

[22:53:40] <manicennui> Can we stop pretending that most people need faster hardware and just make better phones?
[22:54:04] <manicennui> And support them for long periods of time
[22:54:34] <riv> yes
[22:54:36] <riv> we NEED to do this
[22:55:02] <riv> there's so much waste with these devices
[23:02:04] <prussian> no, I need fastererererererer
[23:02:11] <prussian> gotta go fast
[23:04:10] <Geekingfrog> I wonder if phones were leased instead of bought, would that be an incentive important enough to make durable shit?

[23:04:26] <buttsbot> Twatter - ign - In 1969, we went to the moon. In 2022, the moon will come to us. 🌕💥🌎   Watch the intense, world-shaking teaser trailer for Roland E...
[23:05:57] <prussian> Geekingfrog: nah. they tried that, as in Verizon.
[23:06:01] <prussian> i don't think it works.
[23:06:24] <Geekingfrog> verizon makes phone ?
[23:06:38] <prussian> no, they use to basically have those stupid 2yr upgrade plans
[23:06:41] <prussian> same concept.
[23:06:55] <prussian> Geekingfrog: but it looks so intense bro.
[23:06:56] <prussian> sorry
[23:07:03] <prussian> ngoldbaum: : but it looks so intense bro.
[23:07:36] <ngoldbaum> on a scale of independence day to day after tomorrow
[23:07:50] <ngoldbaum> roland emmerich certainly has a shtick
[23:07:55] <prussian> hey, I liked independence day
[23:08:37] <prussian> I even thought the hacking scene was semi realistic. I can totally see aliens having a day-0 vuln if they are basically just a bunch of multigenerational resource stealing fuckwads floating through space.
[23:09:02] <Brekkjern> I have a feeling that I won't understand big-o notation from the profs...
[23:09:10] <prussian> don't worry.
[23:09:17] <Brekkjern> They've just been chucking numbers at us as if that's gonna explain shit :P
[23:10:06] <Brekkjern> I get the notation. It's just the calculations that they absolutely suck at explaining.
[23:10:36] <Brekkjern> Also, their handwriting is less readable than hieroglyphs
[23:16:50] <Brekkjern> They write "1" as ^
[23:16:57] <Brekkjern> It's fantastic
