[20:05:47] <kompowiec2> git clone gitlab.com and that's all
[20:07:35] <qrpnxz> there are other things on gitlab besides git (if you only wanted clone functionality, gitlab is a nuke to compared to granade). Also, it's trisquel so it's kind of an unprincipled thing to do.
[20:08:35] <qrpnxz> it gets total fail in GNU's "Ethical repo" eval lol https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.html
[20:09:50] <belgin> you can host gitlab on your own server

[20:10:48] <belgin> "<qrpnxz> gitlab is completely unusable without proprietary javascript" this is just plain wrong
[20:11:16] <qrpnxz> it's not wrong, no content will display
[20:11:28] <kompowiec2> the only thing which piss me off it you can't use search engine without account
[20:11:36] <jacobk> I'm glad they updated the ethical repo evaluation, IIRC it was listed as C until recently.
[20:11:45] <qrpnxz> i have to run code without corresponding source under free license, even if it's self-hostable, that is the situation for every gitlab i have accessed, including trisquels
[20:11:55] *** Joins: wolftune (~aaron@71-36-108-71.ptld.qwest.net)
[20:11:56] <belgin> the javascript in gitlab is freely licensed, it's just not compatible with librejs
[20:12:09] <belgin> because you have to do extra steps to make it compatible with librejs
[20:12:33] <qrpnxz> again i have no offer to corresponding source, even if the source hypothetically exist somewhere, that is not enough
[20:13:23] <kompowiec2> i would be glad to see gitea on this evaluation
[20:14:36] <GNUmer> kompowiec2: Yeah. Codeberg hasn't been evaluated and I'm wondering why only Savannah has the A rating.
[20:15:43] <kompowiec2> I guess he would get a C grade
[20:15:49] <belgin> qrpnxz, what do you mean by "offer to corresponding source"?
[20:16:07] <GNUmer> Codeberg is just a Gitea provider.
[20:19:13] <kompowiec2> GNUmer, I think perfectionism means that hardly anyone can get A. For example, if you removed these words, sr.ht would get A- without problems.

[23:48:13] <vitali64> updates*
[23:48:18] <kompowiec2> vitali64, according to isf, each which isn't mentioned on FSF page

[23:48:30] <vitali64> i don't need them!
[23:48:37] <notdaniel> vitali64: you can avoid uploading microcode but it's still there
[23:48:43] <vitali64> notdaniel: ???
[23:48:51] <vitali64> libreboot is microcode-free
[23:48:55] <isf> ok, that mean you run nonfree software, in some part, that is the reason you dont run a free distro vitali64?
[23:49:01] <vitali64> isf: no
[23:49:06] <vitali64> i don't use nonfree software
[23:49:07] <notdaniel> vitali64: microcode is what actually defines instructions on a cisc cpu
[23:49:24] <vitali64> i know
[23:49:33] <vitali64> i'm a libreboot contributor
[23:49:41] <notdaniel> Intel cpus usually let you update the microcode, which libreboot doesn't do

[23:52:28] <isf> ofcourse
[23:52:30] <vitali64> no
[23:52:31] <isf> becouse they recommend 
[23:52:34] <kompowiec2> isf, not every distro that does not adhere to the FSF philosophy is not non-free. For example gentoo is completely free software in default
[23:52:34] <vitali64> ?
[23:52:35] <isf> promote, and share
[23:52:37] <vitali64> isf: no
[23:52:37] <isf> nonfree software
[23:52:39] <vitali64> no
[23:52:39] <isf> es they do

[23:52:42] <isf> ofcourse
[23:52:44] <vitali64> NO
[23:52:45] <isf> ofcourse yes
[23:52:46] <isf> they do
[23:52:54] <notdaniel> GNUmer: it kinda depends who you ask
[23:52:57] <vitali64> but that doesnt mean the distro is proprietary
[23:53:00] <vitali64> XD
[23:53:04] <isf> ofcourse
[23:53:04] <notdaniel> isf, vitali64 cool it lol
[23:53:15] <isf> this is the deffinition of a free distro: Free distributions (or “distros”) of the GNU/Linux system only include and only propose free software.

[23:54:24] <isf> that is a possibility
[23:54:33] <isf> not a reality
[23:54:46] <isf> the real reason for run a nonfree distro is run propietary software

[23:56:23] <isf> a lot of opensource ideals

[23:58:12] <isf> <qrpnxz> "i dont know people who run debian without nonfree software" i take it you don't know many pp > completly wrong, say me 1 person with debian who say no to all nonfree software in the world?

[23:59:07] <isf> of your computer user freedom
[23:59:08] <Noisytoot> isf: Yes, but that's not relevant. I could run an FSDG-compliant distro and have a phone, it doesn't prevent that.
[23:59:13] <isf> ofcourse is relevant
[23:59:32] <Noisytoot> No, what distro I use on another computer is not relevant to whether or not I have a phone.
[23:59:34] <isf> phones are completly a lose of your computer user freedom
[23:59:44] <Noisytoot> I could use Trisquel and have a phone, does that mean trisquel is nonfree?
[23:59:44] <isf> even have or not a free operating system
