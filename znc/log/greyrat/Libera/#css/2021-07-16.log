[07:06:05] <Rockwood> https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/YzVpXNq?editors=1111 why ::selection not sensing?
[07:08:21] <Rockwood> what i am missing

[07:11:03] *** Quits: bambanxx (~bambanx@181-163-43-244.baf.movistar.cl) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[07:26:07] <FunkyBob> "wba child"??
[07:26:26] <Rockwood> joking
[07:26:29] <Rockwood> nothing
[07:26:37] <FunkyBob> i have no idea what 'wba' means in that context
[07:26:49] <Rockwood> wht about
[07:26:53] <Rockwood> lol
[07:27:14] <FunkyBob> umm.... ok
[07:27:18] <FunkyBob> meanwhile
[07:27:26] <FunkyBob> what is it you think li::selection will do?
[07:27:52] <Rockwood> color change og bg's of li
[07:27:56] <FunkyBob> if i select the text then hover, it does indeed become white-on-blue
[07:27:58] <Rockwood> and text too
[07:28:06] <FunkyBob> but only the hovered bits
[07:28:15] <Rockwood> means?
[07:28:17] <FunkyBob> sorry, only the pop-up bits
[07:28:40] <FunkyBob> but that makes sense when you ahve li:hover > ul > li::selection
[07:29:08] <Rockwood> but its not working in my case
[07:29:12] <Rockwood> idk why?
[07:30:12] <FunkyBob> select the visibl links... then hover
[07:30:39] <FunkyBob> specifically, make your selection span both list items
[07:31:14] <Rockwood> like?
[07:31:20] <Rockwood> in li span?
[07:31:24] <FunkyBob> huh?
[07:31:44] <Rockwood> FunkyBob> specifically, make your selection span both list items
[07:31:50] <FunkyBob> so I clicked and dragged to select the text in both "First Stat" and "Total"
[07:31:59] <FunkyBob> when I do that, it implicitly selects the hidden list items
[07:32:31] <Rockwood> only on "first stat" please
[07:32:40] <Rockwood> not on total
[07:32:45] <FunkyBob> then your selector is wrong
[07:32:50] <Rockwood> okay
[07:32:56] <FunkyBob> as you're selecting for when the pop-up / hidden li is selected
[07:33:21] <Rockwood> what should be there?
[07:33:34] <FunkyBob> what do you want to happen?
[07:34:48] <Rockwood> i wanna show pointer effect in popup
[07:35:13] <FunkyBob> err... pardon?
[07:35:56] <Rockwood> wait let me show you example
[07:39:40] <Rockwood> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover
[07:40:05] <Rockwood> see on cursor color changing on pointer
[07:42:07] <FunkyBob> cursor?  no...
[07:42:17] <Rockwood> oops
[07:42:34] <Rockwood> i am talking about mouse pointer
[07:42:52] <Rockwood> sorry my english is not good enough
[07:42:53] <FunkyBob> yes, t hat's what Iassumed you meant
[07:44:13] <Rockwood> in "First Stat"s list when pointer on any li it will be change the bg color and text color too

[07:49:41] <FunkyBob> so... when  you select part of the visible LI text, y ou want to control the colours it sues?
[07:49:44] <FunkyBob> uses
[07:49:55] <FunkyBob> because what you have now controls the li in the ul inside that one
[07:50:00] <Rockwood> yes
[07:50:24] <FunkyBob> read the selector you used...
[07:50:41] <Rockwood> yes i did
[07:51:40] <FunkyBob> describe what it selects... in english
[07:51:41] <Rockwood> .statsDetails li:hover > ul > li:nth-child(even) works well
[07:51:53] <FunkyBob> .statsDetails li:hover > ul > li::selection {
[07:53:44] <Rockwood> looks fine to me
[07:53:56] <Rockwood> but i am not sure what is your point
[07:53:59] <Rockwood> ?
[07:54:29] <Rockwood> hover's ul child element li
[07:54:31] <FunkyBob> you say you want it to behave when you select the top LI... but you put ::selection on the nested LI
[07:54:47] <FunkyBob> no, your :hover is on li
[07:55:14] <FunkyBob> LI-that-is-selected as child of UL as child of LI-that-is-hovered
[07:55:14] <Rockwood> ah okay means its need another hover
[07:55:21] <FunkyBob> ...
[07:55:26] <FunkyBob> no?
[07:55:30] <Rockwood> and then select
[07:55:43] <FunkyBob> in your example... is it "First Stat" you want to control the select colours of?
[07:56:10] <Rockwood> i wanna hover on second child too
[07:56:27] <FunkyBob> is that a "yes"?  or something else?
[07:56:45] <Rockwood> yes
[07:56:46] <FunkyBob> when yo usay 'second child'.... you mean "Total"?
[07:57:13] <Rockwood>                     <li>second item first subitem</li> on this
[07:57:41] <FunkyBob> ok, but I can't hover over that... when I move to it, it vanishes
[07:57:43] <Rockwood> ul > li >ul > li <--- on this child
[07:57:54] <FunkyBob> ...
[07:58:05] <FunkyBob> which text do ytou want to alter?
[07:58:17] <Rockwood>  <li>second item first subitem</li> this
[07:58:29] <FunkyBob> and when do you want it to alter/
[07:58:31] <FunkyBob> ?
[07:59:11] <Rockwood> https://codepen.io/cyberia/pen/YzVpXNq?editors=1111  line number 7 of html i wanna change color on mouse pointer of 7 number line
[07:59:25] <Rockwood> in view
[08:00:01] <FunkyBob> you want its colour to change when the mouse hovers over..... something?
[08:00:05] <FunkyBob> so nothing to do with text selection?
[08:00:25] <Rockwood> [09:00:05] <FunkyBob> you want its colour to change when the mouse hovers over..... something?   yes i wanna do this
[08:00:38] <FunkyBob> ok... when you mouse over what?
[08:01:13] <Rockwood> <FunkyBob> ok... when you mouse over what? you means when pointer out from element?
[08:01:35] <FunkyBob> i'm just trying to understand what you want totrigger this colour change
[08:01:56] <FunkyBob> your original paste included something about text selection... but now you're ssaying only on hover
[08:01:59] <FunkyBob> so... I'm confused
[08:02:13] <FunkyBob> and I can't hover over that element directly... so you must want it triggered by some other state
[08:02:18] <FunkyBob> what is that triggering state/condition?
[08:02:57] <Rockwood> i am confuse
[08:03:09] <FunkyBob> YOU'RE confused?
[08:03:19] <Rockwood> FunkyBob> what is that triggering state/condition?
[08:03:20] <FunkyBob> I'm just trying to get you to explain what you want
[08:03:22] <Rockwood> about this
[08:03:30] <FunkyBob> when do you want the colour to change?
[08:03:44] <Rockwood> just on mouse pointer it should be focus
[08:03:56] <FunkyBob> "on mouse pointer" doesn't make sense
[08:04:05] <FunkyBob> on hover?  or on focus? or something else?
[08:04:11] <Rockwood> on focus
[08:04:16] <FunkyBob> on _focus_ now?
[08:04:18] <FunkyBob> fark
[08:04:21] <FunkyBob> it keeps shifting
[08:04:36] <FunkyBob> I don't think you can focus non-interactive elements
[08:04:58] <Rockwood> i think this is suitable "focus"
[08:05:14] <FunkyBob> "focus" is, for instance, when you click in an input field, it's considered in focus
[08:05:15] <Rockwood> so what should be there then?
[08:05:20] <FunkyBob> or tab to a link...
[08:05:55] <FunkyBob> so 'focus' is not the same as hover or selected, which you had in your original example

[08:11:23] <Rockwood> ok
[08:11:38] <Rockwood> hope you understand my question
[08:11:40] <FunkyBob> there's a gap between the elements so if I move at normal pace it loses :hover and the nested UL vanishes
[08:11:52] <FunkyBob> so
[08:12:04] <FunkyBob> when I _hover_ over "second item first subitem" ... you want the colour to change?

[15:31:20] <hassoon> birkoff: yep
[15:32:52] <birkoff> how?
[15:33:01] <hassoon> birkoff: use the ::placeholder pseudoelement selector to target the placeholder itself
[15:33:11] <hassoon> otherwise for the input element, you know how to address it
[15:33:25] <hassoon> e.g input::placeholder
[15:33:27] <hassoon> etc
[15:33:48] <birkoff> thanks
[15:34:13] <birkoff> I tried looking for it in the devtools css pseudo-selector list but it wasn't there

[19:28:07] <entuland> afidegnum, could you specify better which text you refer to?
[19:30:52] <entuland> if you refer to div.coundown, you're doing odd things with the contents - such as trying to line up using a large line height
[19:31:55] <entuland> and you're using old, tricky layouts using floats
[19:32:13] <entuland> you should really stop using floats and properly use the new grid / flex layouts
[19:32:27] <entuland> also getting rid of all of those clearfixes
[19:35:00] <entuland> you should probably also remove that email address from there, as it doesn't look like you own it
[19:35:17] <afidegnum> wait a min, let me upload the update
[19:37:31] <afidegnum> entuland: i have managed to do something but i need to shift the text to the middle https://pdci.teleconso.com/index.html
[19:37:50] <entuland> you still didn't clarify which text you refer to exactly
[19:38:17] <afidegnum> Compte à rebours: Jour J - 1572 - ....
[19:38:35] <entuland> okay, did you read my remarks above?
[19:39:01] <entuland> is that something you adapted copied from somewhere else, or you pushed those lines down with line-height yourself?
[19:39:28] <afidegnum> it's a demo theme i wanted to show a client, and later would polish it
[19:39:46] <entuland> bad idea, don't hack it around badly when you can do the right thing right away
[19:39:48] <afidegnum> i have added the div.countdown myself
[19:39:59] <entuland> okay, remove those weird line heights
[19:40:08] *** Quits: Akimb (~Akimb@86.100.13.100) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[19:40:10] <afidegnum> i just removed it
[19:40:16] <afidegnum> i posted the new update
[19:40:22] <entuland> move the _parent_ instead, preferably using a grid layout in the parent of div.countdown
[19:40:52] <afidegnum> which parent is that ?
[19:40:59] <entuland> use the inspector
[19:41:33] <entuland> you have the menu, the logo and that compte text in a container
[19:41:40] <entuland> make that container have a grid layout
[19:41:52] <entuland> define your grid template
[19:42:03] <entuland> and then you can tweak the placement with padding or something like that
[19:42:19] <entuland> remove that float for the logo as soon as you can
[19:42:29] <entuland> and the float for the menu as well
[19:42:58] <entuland> floats should only be used to float images or the alike in the flow of text wrapping around the images
[19:43:02] <entuland> use proper layouts
[19:43:09] <afidegnum> should .countdown be display: grid ?
[19:43:13] <entuland> no
[19:43:24] <entuland> the parent of .countdown should
[19:43:56] <afidegnum> class="container-box clearfix"
[19:44:56] <entuland> yes, but beware that you may get your rules applied to other stuff around
[19:45:17] <entuland> give this specific div an ID, or use a selector that truly only affects this div
[19:45:33] <afidegnum> when applied the box felt down
[19:45:47] <entuland> well, did you also create your grid template?
[19:45:56] <afidegnum> no
[19:46:04] <entuland> then no wonder it's not working
[19:46:11] <entuland> do you know how to use a grid layout?
[19:46:22] <afidegnum> not very well,
[19:46:31] <entuland> then check the docs and learn it the faster you can
[19:47:08] <entuland> don't delay it, you're going to waste more time by hacking your way around a possibly broken template / copied page from somewhere else, instead of learning how to control the layout yourself properly
[19:47:27] <afidegnum> well, my client is coming, i can't do much again,
[19:47:57] <entuland> well that will serve as a lesson not to plan a meeting before you're ready for the meeting :P
[19:48:40] <entuland> if you show them something that seems working fine but it's a mess, they'll expect you to put that into production as soon as possible
[19:48:52] <entuland> better to show something clearly incomplete so that they know there is still work to be done
[19:49:02] <afidegnum> well, i pray
[19:49:37] <entuland> this page is your friend: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web
[19:49:59] <entuland> and this, for the very case above: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout
[19:58:31] <hassoon> afidegnum: just create e.g a div that you give a class of e.g .menu-wrapper, in which you place the ul.main-nav__main-navigation inside, then take the .countdown and make it a direct sibling to ul.main-nav__main-navigation, then all you need to do is to remove the left-margin:100px rule from .countdown, and give it text-align:center
[20:00:14] <afidegnum> ok
[20:07:07] <hassoon> afidegnum: this hypothetical .menu-wrapper should take the place of ul.main-nav__main-navigation anyway
[20:09:45] <entuland> feel free to keep on patching it, but beware that you'll have to do the right thing sooner or later, possibly also mobile-first: https://i.imgur.com/3rptGOI.png
[20:10:58] <afidegnum> ok, thanks,
