[09:48:38] <Axman6> maybe start by using a let statement to give names to each of the parts
[09:49:06] <haskell-noob> this isn't my code -- i'm just trying to understand it
[09:49:10] <Axman6> not that I've said that, I'm not sure where to start XD
[09:50:01] <Axman6> now*
[09:53:09] <Axman6> let countFactors x = length (filter (\d -> d `rem` x == 0) [1..65536]) in print (sum $ map countFators [1..65535])
[09:53:18] <Axman6> roughly
[09:54:45] <haskell-noob> so would the countFactors return all integers 1 to 65535 where the integer is divisible by x?
[09:55:54] <Axman6> it counts how many numbers are factors of the given number below 65536, it doesn't return them
[09:56:11] <Axman6> but filter (\d -> d `rem` x == 0) [1..65536] does
[09:56:14] <haskell-noob> ahhh
[09:56:16] <haskell-noob> right of course
[09:56:19] <haskell-noob> that makes sense
[09:56:20] <Axman6> factorsOf x = filter (\d -> d `rem` x == 0) [1..65536]

[10:09:16] <pavonia> @src length
[10:09:16] <lambdabot> Source not found. Do you think like you type?
[10:09:18] <[exa]> in particular, `makeSet` doesn't support empty list, because you always require the first element by patternmatching (x:xs)
[10:09:21] <pavonia> :<
[10:09:41] <[exa]> Inst: you can easily make another version for `makeSet [] = ` below that
[10:11:18] <Inst> thanks
[10:11:31] <[exa]> btw there's a way to patternmatch in guards, which could allow you to match both [] and (x:xs) variants in there (google "pattern guards") but I guess the above variant will be nicer
[10:11:41] <Inst> still ugly, but i hate pure pattern matching
[10:12:19] <Inst> i also discovered i hate this textbook and hutton's is better, but if I don't finish it I'm just going to keep on switching from textbook to textbook until I've read the entirety of haskell literature targeted at non-programmers

[10:13:30] <Inst> having to type the function over and over again
[10:13:33] <Inst> it's a nice tool when you need it
[10:14:21] <Inst> and in Haskell, is there a way to say c == (2 || 3)?
[10:15:24] <Inst> thanks for the help, [exa]
[10:15:32] <lortabac> Inst: pattern-matching does not require typing the function name over and over again
[10:15:47] <lortabac> you can use "case"
[10:16:20] <lortabac> the syntax with the repeated function name is just syntactic sugar, it's useful when you want to match on multiple arguments at once
[10:16:39] <[exa]> Inst: I guess || isn't the boolean OR, ie. the condition doesn't reduce to c==True right?
[10:16:54] <[exa]> Inst: in that case ' c `elem` [2,3] ' would work
[10:17:18] <[exa]> also yeah +1 for `case`
[10:17:35] <Inst> i see
[10:18:22] <Inst> it's intended as a boolean or, i.e, ways to stuff things on one line and so on

[11:00:14] <timCF> Hello I do have a problem. Problem are hundreds of types generated from Google Protobuf API schema, which do have a lot of ByteString fields which are looking ugly in case I'm trying to log them using Show. I'd prefer ByteString to look just like array of bytes (Int8) or at least as normal hex string. Is there any easy solution except doing my own GHC.Generics based Show class (to not implement it for any 
[11:00:20] <timCF> single of hundreds types)?

[11:05:27] <[exa]> normally you'd need to rewrite the Show instance for ByteString which is not adviseable I'd say
[11:06:52] <[exa]> notably, `generic-pretty` is pretty good
[11:07:22] <[exa]> and you can easily inject a specialized ByteString handling there

[15:47:17] <mastarija> Do you think a game server for a game like Agar.IO implemented in Haskell can be profitable?
[15:47:44] <merijn> Yes, no, maybe, it depends
[15:47:44] <dminuoso> I dont think games are profitable in general.
[15:48:03] <mastarija> I've been working on a similar game for a while now, and now I'm thinking about costs of maintaining such a game server
[15:48:18] <dminuoso> Most game developers do it out of either misbelief in hidden fortunes, because they are masochists or because they just like games a lot.
[15:48:21] <merijn> Let me refine my answer: If you think technology matters for game success, you probably don't understand games well enough to make a profit :)
[15:48:47] <mastarija> Or rather, since margins will probably be tight I'm not sure if I could cover server expenses
[15:49:01] <dminuoso> The only way to make money off a game, is by hiring hords of underpayed developers, giving them high pressure to release poor code quickly, do good marketing, and then sell your game.
[15:49:04] <merijn> mastarija: Doubt it, servers are *really* cheap these days
[15:49:24] <dminuoso> mastarija: What's expensive about games is the developers and marketing.

[15:51:53] <kuribas> mastarija: high server fees makes it sound like you'll have a lot of users :)
[15:52:08] <mastarija> That's the end goal
[15:52:16] <dminuoso> mastarija: First reality is, if you want contributors for a game, haskell is a terrible pick out of its low popularity.
[15:52:21] <merijn> mastarija: Note that if you're in comfortable with C and C++ then mixing and matching with Haskell as glue code is fairly straightforward

[15:54:06] <dminuoso> merijn: Its not just divine inspiration though. You also need to channel divine energy to keep you alive while working tirelessly 15 hours a day, 6.5 days a week for 53 weeks in a year to deliver your indie game.
[15:54:20] <dminuoso> It's a darn cutthroat business.
[15:54:27] <zincy> When it comes to building projects people generally spend way too much time on the technology and then find out no one cares about the product
[15:54:33] <dminuoso> It's pretty much like fintech, except without the money.
[15:54:33] <zincy> *products
[15:54:33] <mastarija> With corona + some crypto gains I finally had some time to relax and work on the game ;)
[15:55:10] <mastarija> I've read that one of the "price" bottlenecks for games is bandwidth
[15:55:23] <dminuoso> Or any startup I guess? :)
[15:55:34] <mastarija> + I have somewhat more complex physics than agar

[15:57:22] <merijn> mastarija: bandwidth is fairly cheap in the grand scheme of things. You can get a 2 core server with 2TB bandwidth per month for, like, 5 dollars or less. The main bandwidth restriction in gaming is that you need good latency which limits how much data you can rely on sending
[15:57:36] <mastarija> So Haskell memory and cpu usage are not a big concern for a game server you think?
[15:57:47] <dminuoso> Seeing as Im working at an ISP, I can tell you right away that servers and bandwidths are mostly for free.
[15:57:48] <mastarija> merijn, yes, latency is a given

[15:58:43] <dminuoso> mastarija: One of the problems with Haskell, is that in GHC Haskell we have a stop-the-world garbage collector.
[15:58:46] <dminuoso> That can create latency issues.
[15:59:17] <boxscape_> There is a low-latency garbage collector as well though, now
[15:59:18] <mastarija> dminuoso, yes that's ok I think
[15:59:31] <merijn> boxscape_: "low"
[15:59:37] <boxscape_> lower, at least
[15:59:38] <dminuoso> mastarija: Its okay if your game server pauses for 10ms in the wrong moment?
[15:59:40] <dminuoso> Just asking.
[15:59:58] <mastarija> yes, I have decent client side prediction
[16:00:51] <mastarija> my main concern now is "if" I suddenly get a lot of trafic, I don't want to loose those customers because I couldn't scale

[16:05:44] <mastarija> and being the only dev with no cash I can't scale
[16:05:57] <merijn> I mean, realistically getting more than 0 traffic exceeds the average indie
[16:06:08] <merijn> Your problem won't be "I can't scale"
[16:06:23] <dminuoso> merijn: Haha. Read that news about that fancy "electronic drivers license app" fail in Germany?

[16:07:34] *** Joins: slowtyper (~slowtyper@user/slowtyper)
[16:08:08] <kuribas> mastarija: spend you time in advance to make it work, then if you'ld get enough traffic, you should have more funds to make it performant.
[16:08:08] <dminuoso> merijn: It was some "government spends many millions on blockchain nonsense" on an electronic drivers license that is worthless (its not recognizable in a traffic control), and it turns out that after the first thousand registration the entire thing came crashing in performance. It couldn't even scale to *hold* or process more than a thousand registrations.
[16:08:10] <dminuoso> Total.
[16:08:16] <lortabac> mastarija: I'd suggest you to focus on one problem at a time
[16:08:17] <dminuoso> Not thousand a second, Just some thousand total.
[16:08:43] <lortabac> for now the focus should be on releasing the game and have users
[16:09:15] <mastarija> lortabac, I know that, I was just looking for some opinions since I have no experience with Haskell in production
[16:09:28] <dminuoso> mastarija: Since you have limited funds, pick a language you're already familiar with.
[16:09:43] <geekosaur> there might be better ways to get experience on haskell in production than trying to dive into gamedev with no experience
[16:09:44] <dminuoso> It reduces costs of making the many learning mistakes of a completely strange programming language.
[16:09:58] <geekosaur> my own experience is one new thing is enough, two at once is asking for trouble
[16:10:09] <kuribas> It will be much harder to get good latency in haskell than in C++.
[16:10:13] <dminuoso> Haskell is particularly nasty to create performance problems with if you don't have experience.
[16:10:20] <mastarija> It takes some effort to write the server, if for some reason unbeknownst to me Haskell might be troublesome for a game server (other than garbage collector) than I'd go with CPP
[16:10:28] <mastarija> I know CPP and Haskell very well
[16:10:34] <dminuoso> If I was to write a game server, I might do it in Rust perhaps?

[21:42:06] <sm> yes, it is still quite hard to make a cabal script reproducible. The other part of it, mentioned here recently, is that it depends on you having done cabal update recently
[21:42:30] <sclv> i don't think "paste in the deps" is hard. *shrug*
[21:42:46] <sclv> i do think we should better document the grammar of the cabal header block
[21:42:52] <maerwald> how do you generate a freeze file without a cabal file?
[21:42:57] <sclv> i think its closer to a cabal.project than a cabal file, but ot sure

[23:39:27] <ski> merijn : fwiw, there's also "augend" (that which is added to) and "addend" (the thing to add)

[23:40:08] <geekosaur> "augend" looks too much like "augeas"

[23:56:54] <ski> i'd only use "augend","addend", when there's a clear difference between the "absolute amount", and the "relative amount" added to it
[23:57:22] <ski> (e.g. adding a vector to a point. or adding a temperature difference to an absolute temperature, &c.)
