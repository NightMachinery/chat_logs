[03:28:52] <harwiltz> where L is the generator of (R_t)
[03:31:06] <harwiltz> The issue is the generator here doesn't have any term that really accounts for the noise. The generator of the solution of dX_t = m(x)dt + s(x)dB_t would look something like (Lf)(x) = <\nabla f(x), m(x)> + 0.5 * s^2(x) * Tr(Hessian(f)(x))

[04:07:42] <nejimban> it's not redundant, just not necessary
[04:07:46] <CuriousErnestBro> nejimban why not? suppose g(x,y_1,..., y_n) = y_1
[04:08:14] <CuriousErnestBro> then E[Y_1] does not exist
[04:08:14] <nejimban> also you should say what μ is

[04:09:09] <nejimban> what we want is g(Y) integrable, not Y
[04:10:10] <CuriousErnestBro> so g(x,y_1,..., y_n) = y_1 isn't allowed when Y_1 doesn't have mean?

[04:15:41] <CuriousErnestBro> btw is continuous also redundant?

[04:16:25] <CuriousErnestBro> hmmm
[04:16:32] <CuriousErnestBro> what does that mean?
[04:16:46] <CuriousErnestBro> I thought if something was not necessary it is automatically redundant
[04:17:46] <nejimban> redundant for me is when you are saying the same thing twice
[04:18:12] <nejimban> here we want g integrable, we don't care if it's continuous
[04:18:30] <CuriousErnestBro> ohh okay
[04:18:36] <nejimban> but you could take g also continuous if you want
[04:18:49] <CuriousErnestBro> I thought this L^1 thing captured that it couldn't be non-continuous

[09:10:43] <greenbagels> magic_ninja: the perpendicularity requirement is exactly what determines the length of F
[09:10:50] <magic_ninja> greenbagels, the issue is that the magnitude of F was that for the situation I marked, but it wasn't the magnitude of F
[09:11:09] <greenbagels> so yes, you are right; without knowing F you don't know if the line segment is perpendicular; but one automatically determines the other
[09:11:28] <magic_ninja> except the axis aren't perpendicular
[09:11:47] <greenbagels> right, that's the real problem
[09:11:57] <greenbagels> u cannot be the hypotenuse because it is merely a compoenent of F
[09:12:02] <greenbagels> surely it has at most, the same length as F
[09:14:05] <greenbagels> magic_ninja: for reference; the line segment labeled u is not meant to show the actual component F_u; it's just to show you the u coordinate eaxis

[11:59:43] <Fangs> Galois or anyone for that matter, do you guys have any resources on how to do symbolic computation sanely?
[12:00:31] <savask> Fangs: In what area?
[12:01:00] <Fangs> savask: what do you mean?
[12:01:30] <savask> What kind of symbolic computations do you want to do
[12:01:48] <Fangs> so I got polynomials working from ages ago, now I want to define derivation (in the sense of a differential ring)
[12:02:28] <Fangs> I have formal variables c1, ... cn, and d(cj) = (n-j+1)c(j-1), etc
[12:02:43] <Fangs> I can make this work if I choose a concrete n, say.. 5
[12:03:07] <Fangs> but I'd have to rewrite everything, effectively, if I change n from 5 to 6.. this seems annoying, idk how to get around it
[12:03:18] <savask> Ah
[12:03:22] <savask> And what CAS do you use?
[12:03:37] <Fangs> homemade really shitty haskell
[12:04:14] <Fangs> elements of a commutative free algebra is some data type I defined
[12:04:31] <lavadonut> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation ?
[12:05:48] <savask> Fangs: If you're programming it yourself, isn't it easy to define 'd' to work for arbitrary n
[12:06:17] <Fangs> assuming you're sufficiently skilled at programming, perhaps
[12:06:57] <ChaiTRex> Fangs: You just want to do basic derivatives of polynomials?
[12:07:52] <Fangs> not quite my expressions are polynomials in c1,...,cn, but d(cj) =(n-j+1)c(j-1) is another polynomial
[12:07:59] <Fangs> it kinda permutes the expressions
[12:08:41] <Fangs> *variables
[12:09:00] <Fangs> you extend on the rest of polynomial by the product rule ofc, d(fg) = d(f)g + f d(g)
[12:09:01] <savask> Fangs: How does your free algebra type look like?
[12:09:32] <Fangs> look.. I'm not proud of this but this is the code https://pastebin.com/gSGkBZ2S
[12:09:54] <Fangs> a polynomial is a list of coefficient and string of variables essentially
[12:10:03] <Fangs> where a variable is a char int pair
[12:11:35] <savask> Fangs: So "Var 'c' 3" is c_3?

[12:17:46] <Fangs> thats too sane
[12:18:09] <Fangs> I might use matlab's symbolic math library
[12:18:22] <Fangs> thats the only thing i'm familiar with

[13:35:30] <glaucon> suppose i have a smooth map phi: M -> N, M and N are manifolds. let m be a point \in M. wikipedia says there is a unique extension of phi to a map h: T(TM) -> T(TN) between tensor algebras

[13:37:04] <Fangs> glaucon: you need to get a linear map first from TM to TN
[13:37:10] <Fangs> (this would be dphi)
[13:37:27] <glaucon> yes
[13:37:27] <Fangs> (or at least pointwise linear)
[13:37:28] <glaucon> i know that
[13:37:45] <glaucon> how to get from that to the final map?
[13:37:56] <glaucon> it's easy for tensors of type (s,0)
[13:38:24] <Fangs> glaucon: let F: V -> W be a linear map, we wish to extend this to the tensor algebra TF: TV -> TW, so on the generating elements say.. v (x) w, it's just Tv (x) Tw

[13:42:14] <glaucon> i.e. members of the tangent space
[13:42:34] <Fangs> dphi evaluated at a point p is only defined for tangent vectors at that point p
[13:42:51] <glaucon> so dphi(df) is undefined?
[13:43:00] <Fangs> what's f?

[13:45:51] <glaucon> well the part that i don't understand is how to apply the extended map to tensors that are tensor products of both vectors and dual vectors

[13:47:23] <Fangs> no
[13:47:37] <Fangs> ok so lets separate "tensors" and "tangets"
[13:47:58] <Fangs> Ten(V) is the tensor algebra over a vector space V
[13:48:12] <Fangs> if M is a manifold TM is the tangent space
[13:48:26] <Fangs> so in your question:
[13:48:34] <Fangs>  ...phi to a map h: Ten(TM) -> Ten(TN) between tensor algebras
[13:48:48] <Fangs> and in that line I wrote previously
[13:48:56] <elf_fortrez> what does d and phi represent
[13:49:16] <elf_fortrez> sorry, late to the party
[13:49:21] <Fangs> let F: V -> W be a linear map, we wish to extend this to the tensor algebra TenF: TenV -> TenW, so on the generating elements say.. v (x) w, it's just Fv (x) Fw

[13:51:03] <bildramer> except in the end it all works out as if you had used coordinates from the start
[13:51:13] <glaucon> oh wait. i'm defining tensor as a tensor product of vectors and dual vectors
[13:51:25] <glaucon> are we using the same definition?
[13:51:42] <Fangs> no..
[13:51:48] <bildramer> lol
[13:51:49] <Fangs> tensor algebras aren't usually "mixed"
[13:52:10] <glaucon> my book defines tensors that way
[13:52:20] <glaucon> but it's also pretty old

[13:52:30] <glaucon> it's a differential geometry textbook
[13:52:37] <Fangs> well.. pics?
[13:53:07] <glaucon> what pics?
[13:53:07] <Fangs> bildramer: idk about useful, but in alg top or w/e you often can say functor F is left adjoint to G, so F preserves limits/colimits or whichever
[13:53:08] <elf_fortrez> hm, seems integral
[13:53:10] <Fangs> maybe finite limits
[13:53:26] <Fangs> glaucon: of the definition of tensors, the problem you're working on, idk
[13:53:58] <elf_fortrez> mathematicians argue about axioms not proofs
[13:54:41] <elf_fortrez> wait
[13:54:50] <glaucon> "In general tensors of type (r,s) form a vectors space denoted by T^r_s = V (x) ... (x) V (x) V^* (x) ... (x) V^*"
[13:54:58] <elf_fortrez> that is if a mathecian is defined as a phd in math
[13:55:12] <Fangs> that's fine, but that doesn't define a tensor algebra
[13:55:55] <Fangs> glaucon: whats the book?
[13:56:15] <glaucon> "Tensor Analysis on Manifolds" by Bishop and Goldberg
[13:57:30] <Fangs> 19:05 <glaucon> suppose i have a smooth map phi: M -> N, M and N are manifolds. let m be a point \in M. wikipedia says there is a unique extension of phi to a map h: T(TM) -> T(TN) between tensor algebras
[13:57:34] <Fangs> what about this, where is this from?
[13:58:07] <elf_fortrez> let's say a vector is a sentence whose magnitude is the length of a sentence and the direction is the person who wrote it. then if I am a second order Cauchy stress sensor, i am not the null vector
[13:58:33] <glaucon> it's from the wikipedia page on Lie derivatives https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_derivative#The_Lie_derivative_of_a_tensor_field
[13:58:54] <elf_fortrez> what
[13:58:59] <elf_fortrez> qued
[13:59:10] <Fangs> ok then the wikipedia's page isn't talking about just one type of tensos
[13:59:43] <Fangs> glaucon: tensors algebras are linear combination of tensors of type (0,0), (1,0), ..., (n,0), ...

[14:01:49] <glaucon> i thought tensor algebra meant something different
[14:02:05] <Fangs> glaucon: a linear map F: V -> W induces a dual map F*: W* -> V*
[14:02:11] <glaucon> yes
[14:02:15] <elf_fortrez> can we get some topology rolling
[14:02:22] <elf_fortrez> hahahah
[14:02:25] <Fangs> so if anything, you can define a tensor algebra map Ten(W*) -> Ten(V*) if you want
[14:02:49] <Fangs> but if you're mixing tensors and dual tensors in an algebra, you'd have to tell me what the structure is first
[14:03:00] <elf_fortrez> let's say magma
[14:03:21] <Fangs> glaucon: but on V (x) W*, you can define it as T v (x) T* w*.. just.. really naively I think
[14:03:37] <Fangs> cadmio: how many cyclic group of order n are there?
[14:03:43] <Fangs> (up to isomorphism)
[14:04:02] <elf_fortrez> what is your purpose for building this system glaucon?
[14:04:24] <Pi-sistance> guys, as long as I have the book is there any points in me taking notes. I mean notes + lots of questions seems too much possibly. my notes on  one of the topics felt like a few hours wasted
[14:04:58] <Pi-sistance> it didnt help that I could barely read my handwriting haha
[14:05:01] <glaucon> that answers my question i think. thanks!

[14:05:32] <elf_fortrez> the purpose of systems is to build theorems

[18:40:57] <johnkeats6> granted this problem is exactly the sort of thing you'd expect a bruteforce search method to be useful, and that doesn't happen all that often in math so it was an isolated success

[19:30:19] <rubiksdream> so by positive definite you mean symmetric positive definite right
[19:31:04] <supersecant> Oh I think I've been barking up the wrong tree afterall. I was basing it off how you can compute the eigenvalues by moving the pivots of the matrix and seeing how their signs change. But I guess this doesn't justify what I'm saying because moving the eigenvalues by say adding the Identity matrix moves the pivots in a non linear way
[19:31:42] <supersecant> So if you do (A-I) then this doesn't move the pivots by 1. I guess that would make eigenvalues trivially easy to compute

[21:11:02] <johnkeats6> buster, i remember finding it confusing, but to a degree it isn't lenny's fault. there really is a very annoying thing that happens which is that if you follow the standard Noether procedure to find the energy of the EM field, you do *not* get (1/2)(E^2 + B^2)
[21:11:22] <Z-module> that Noether lady was remarkable in a lot of ways
[21:11:26] <johnkeats6> you get that + an ugly term which is a total derivative of something
[21:11:38] <johnkeats6> so it's "gauge equivalent"
[21:11:45] <Z-module> imagine what she might have gone onto if she'd lived a decently long life
[21:12:26] <johnkeats6> so what lenny does is to fix the gauge conveniently so that you get the "right" formula in the end

[21:32:12] <johnkeats6> no i think you need to treat it like a tensor that you're raising the indices of
[21:32:34] <johnkeats6> in fact it's clear you do because * is metric-dependent so somehow the right hand side has to know about the metric
[21:32:46] <johnkeats6> and indeed it knows because you use the metric to raise indices
[21:32:55] <buster> suppose i'd better work it through. hmph.
[21:33:11] <johnkeats6> might be a good idea. i've never done that myself

[23:29:03] <supersecant> arseniiv: If you take only the first N values I suppose this must result in a complex series x[n] because the spectrum is no longer conjugate symmetric. The resulting x[n] is going to involve a sinc multiplied by a complex exponential term I think
[23:30:03] <supersecant> I'm less familiar with DFTs than I am with fourier transforms but I think the intution is right

[23:30:45] <supersecant> Oh that would convolution with a sinc actually
[23:30:51] <arseniiv> supersecant: ah, I should’ve made new ωs hermitan too, I guess, by taking a half in another way
[23:31:38] <supersecant> Yeah so quarter from one end and quarter from the other
[23:31:44] <arseniiv> as we multiply by a rectangle, on the other side it should convolve with sinc, hm yeah
[23:31:56] <supersecant> yup

[23:35:34] <arseniiv> I’ve looked at DFT matrices in Mathematica and saw that the result is indeed a complicated thing, so I won’t try shortcuts like this on and just take fouriers of the spectrum, the half of it, the quarter of it etc. to the needed level, and maybe I should use non-hermitan spectra and in the end just take real parts of the signals; it would even be simpler and the code idea allows that
