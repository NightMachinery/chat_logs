[06:41:50] <leitz> If I'm just playing with sockets, better to use Socket or IO::Socket::INET?
[06:42:28] <Grinnz> IO::Socket::IP
[06:42:42] <Grinnz> or IO::Async::Socket for nonblocking features
[06:42:54] <Grinnz> slash IO::Async::Stream if you're doing a tcplike thing
[06:44:54] <leitz> I'm just trying to prove to myself that I can do some of those fancy schmanzy microservices things in Perl.
[06:45:08] <Grinnz> then i would definitely start with IO::Async
[06:45:39] <leitz> Using "Programming Perl", and it only has Socket and IO::Socket.  :(
[06:46:10] <leitz> Remember who you're talking to: if you think it's simple enough, it probably isn't.   :)
[06:46:21] <Grinnz> for a persistent service you'll want an event loop of some kind, and you could use a bare select loop if you have to but that's a learning choice and not a production code choice
[06:46:43] *** Quits: vrurg (~vrurg@50.231.121.51) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:46:51] <Grinnz> yeah, the thing is, select loops will end up not simple

[06:47:47] <Juerd> I've been told that it's not okay for production. So they rewrote it, and discovered that, well, abstractions can be costly :)
[06:48:12] <Grinnz> generally much less costly than the I/O, unless you do it wrong
[06:48:25] <Grinnz> (which many things have)

[06:49:06] <Grinnz> but if it's working it's working, no argument there
[06:49:09] <Juerd> Handling many sockets in a single thread is cheap because the kernel's doing the heavy lifting :)
[06:50:38] <Grinnz> if the abstraction was *not* doing that then... well there's the problem
[06:50:38] <Juerd> Now, once you start combining things with different timings (say, you want to do an outgoing http request to handle your incoming request), that's where the simple select loop becomes hard and complicated.
[06:51:11] <Juerd> But as long as everything is aligned along your incoming requests, select away :)
[06:51:17] <Juerd> Or epoll, or whatever :D

[06:54:08] <leitz> Bleagh. Programming Perl has a non-working example for a network server, and Perl Cookbook just did a cut and paste from PP.
[06:54:29] <Juerd> leitz: What's not working?
[06:54:35] <Grinnz> and i just don't like the idea that someone replacing bare select stupidly is a reason not to replace it :P so
[06:56:26] <Juerd> Not fixing what isn't broken is though.
[06:56:47] <Grinnz> indeed, but there are other reasons it would need to be replaced than being broken
[06:56:55] <Grinnz> such as not being maintainable or extendable
[06:57:43] <Juerd> I think you're overgeneralizing. Maintenance is fine as long as the requirements stay comparable, and when they no longer do, it's easily refactored into something else.

[07:05:21] <leitz> Not really. They don't show how to demonstrate a working connection. Not even a simple one. There's a powerful incentive to continue when you see something simple, but brand new to you, actually work.

[07:07:09] <Juerd> You're running the example client.pl and server.pl?
[07:07:59] <leitz> Yes. They actually work, from a "demonstration" viewpoint.
[07:08:22] <Juerd> Okay, and what more would you like?
[07:09:12] <leitz> That was the first step. My frustration is that two of the main Perl books couldn't bother to put a simple example in that actually did something.
[07:09:38] <Juerd> It's an old book. Back then most people wrote lower-level code than is common now
[07:10:11] <Juerd> Using socket(), bind(), listen(), and accept() directly has gone out of fashion.
[07:10:11] <leitz> 2012.
[07:11:06] <leitz> But the demonstration should actually demonstrate. Even if it's out of fashion now, back then it was cutting egge.
[07:11:08] <Juerd> 1991, and updated a few times since then

[07:11:26] <Juerd> It does demonstrate
[07:11:34] <zgu> IO::Socket is a tool of the devil! my scripts use global filehandles and that's the way i likes it!
[07:11:43] <Juerd> The client connects to the server, the server sends the string "Smile from the server", and the client displays what it got.
[07:12:01] <leitz> Right, the web page does, the book code does not.
[07:12:12] <Grinnz> augh, tutorialspoint
[07:12:35] <Juerd> leitz: Ah, I wasn't paying attention and assumed the url was an excerpt from the book. Wasn't actually reading anything and scrolled right to the examples :)

[12:56:16] <iob> in theory why would you choose json over hash to represent some data structure?
[12:57:13] <iob> no serialization is needed and i am asked if i can convert a hash to json but i am not sure if there is any advantage
[13:00:13] <vague> Is it just internal representation?
[13:01:40] <lopid> in order to pass it to another application that expects json

[13:03:16] <iob> yea but i do not have this case
[13:03:17] <vague> For perl internally it should be a hash, outbound it can be json. You have to ask them what the ultimate goal is
[13:03:51] <iob> vague: good point. thanks
[13:04:14] <iob> it is internal representation
[13:08:11] <lopid> if you just want to visualise the hash (external application would then be the terminal or something), you can pass it to something like Data::Dumper or Data::Printer

[17:53:39] <Botje> The_Blode: also note that the modern equivalent is STDOUT->autoflush(1)
[17:53:47] <Botje> which is a bit more descriptive.
[17:54:33] <Altreus> does $| itself only affect STDOUT and STDERR or is it all file handles?
[17:54:42] <Altreus> you can see how often I use it
[17:54:54] <Botje> $| affects the currently select()ed filehandle.
[17:54:59] <Altreus> ah
[17:55:05] <Altreus> so just STDOUT by default
[17:55:21] <Botje> yes, STDOUT is selected by default.
[17:55:29] <Botje> Then you get atrocities like
[17:55:29] <Botje> my $oldfh = select(STDERR); $| = 1; select($oldfh);

[19:37:09] <mst> given it's generated by local::lib

[20:03:56] <mst> xaltsc: CPAN.pm will use .local/share automatically (or XDG_DATA_HOME)
[20:04:14] <mst> so you don't need to configure anything, you just need to install support for the thing you want
[20:05:01] <mst> though I still don't know why you have a .cpan directory at all
[20:05:07] <mst> cpanm + local::lib is quite sufficient
[20:05:33] <xaltsc> mst: probably because I needed the latest version of latexindent.pl
[20:06:05] <mst> xaltsc: cpanm could've handled that better :D

[20:14:47] <mst> xaltsc: anyway, I literally have the CPAN config loading code open in another terminal and if File::HomeDir is installed it prioritises ->my_home and if xdg-user-dir is in $PATH that code loads the FreeDesktop version rather than the plain version

[22:00:21] <shaldannon> that's cool

[22:01:48] <mst> genio: well, yeah, they are dicks but also you deserve that ;)
[22:01:56] <xaltsc> In France, the only way to be treated like a customer is to engage in conversation. Tips don't matter since ppl have salaries.

[22:02:15] <mst> xaltsc: right, completely different milieu
[22:03:02] <genio> mst: Right, because saying "excuse me, could you please tell me where to find the exit. I'm lost in here and the door over there doesn't open"    ... *blank stare*   ...    as if I'm being rude

[22:08:45] <Grinnz> fortunately as long as i never go to quebec, i dont have to know any of this
[22:08:55] <genio> I mean, one could also ask why they put up signs saying exit with an arrow to a door that doesn't open just to fuck with you
[22:08:56] <xaltsc> Quebec is not France though
[22:09:02] <mst> xaltsc: right, so how is that me 'tu'-ing people? that's the bit I'm confused about
[22:09:10] <genio> but french train stations are confusing
[22:09:13] <Grinnz> no, but it's the only place around here that would make me speak french :P
[22:09:40] <mst> genio: oh, that's easy - the sign is an official 'this is the exit' sign, not a real sign, it exists only to make the government fuck off and leave them alone
[22:09:43] <xaltsc> mst: never do that unless you know the person closely or you're in a socialist, communist or green congress.
[22:09:44] <El_Che> as a *non-native* speaker that can speak rather fluently (as in conversations and presentation), I think there is a difference depending on the situation: someone on the street => bonjour, madame/monsier; to a waiter: excusez-moi (because they are on the job)
[22:09:50] <mst> xaltsc: what
[22:09:58] <El_Che> xaltsc: do you experience it like that as a native speaker?
[22:10:05] <mst> xaltsc: I wouldn't use 'tu' to anybody I didn't know well
[22:10:17] <mst> xaltsc: I'm asking why you told me that saying 'excusez-moi' was doing that
[22:10:46] <xaltsc> El_Che: I say "Bonjour, excusez-moi, $question"
[22:10:52] <xaltsc> in all situations
[22:11:18] <xaltsc> mst: you said "excuse-moi" earlier on ?
[22:11:28] <El_Che> xaltsc: you're a belt and suspenders guy
[22:11:41] <xaltsc> El_Che: definitely not :D
[22:11:46] <mst> xaltsc: oh. that's just me sucking at rendering french into letters.
[22:12:01] <mst> sorry for any confusion caused
[22:12:14] <genio> I mean, if someone came up to me here and said "where exit?"   I wouldn't sit there and go "hi" and stare at them blankly
[22:13:12] <mst> xaltsc: I'd been thinking in terms of the final 'e' having an acute accent on it, rather than the 'ez' that you typed out - same -sound- was intended
[22:13:17] <genio> I get there are societal courtesies and all, but that's just straight dick moves
[22:13:37] <xaltsc> Another tricky rule, you wouldn't say "Where is the exit ?" but "Do you have any idea where the exit might be ?"
[22:14:36] <xaltsc> The first one is too aggressive
[22:14:46] <genio> o.O
[22:15:20] <mst> I've got to admit, I've never had a problem with that
[22:15:33] <El_Che> sounding too aggressive?
[22:15:36] <mst> but I always say things like that with an obviously apologetic face and an obviously english accent
[22:15:42] <xaltsc> Well, you assume that the person is supposed to know that, as if you were testing them
[22:15:51] <mst> El_Che: there's gotta be a specific case where it happens :D
[22:16:02] <El_Che> I love the duality of the English stereotypes

[22:59:37] <leitz> Nice. 
[22:59:48] <xaltsc> genio: If I'm being subjective, off-season south of France and the whole Provence, especially if you like greek and roman stuff and if you go to the wildest beaches and some remote areas.
[23:00:12] <leitz> Bravest, or stupidest, thing I did in England was ride my bicycle through a triple roundabout. 
[23:00:13] <xaltsc> genio: If you want more objective suggestion, that depends on what you're looking for.

[23:02:57] <leitz> genio, Capo di Ponte in Italy. 5,000 year old graffitti.
[23:03:01] <mst> leitz: unlike the USians we actually understand how to roundabout
[23:03:13] <xaltsc> genio: the point is less the beaches in themselves than the hike you can do along the coast
[23:03:16] <xaltsc> hikes
[23:03:33] <leitz> mst, in a roundabout way, I guess so.
[23:03:46] <genio> ah, yea. nice hikes would be good. Florida is so flat that it's not something we really do

[23:05:41] <leitz> genio, since new cars are supposed to have backup cameras, instead of the driver using the actual mirror, or turning their stupid head, I'm not so sure about your latest claim...
[23:06:49] <xaltsc> Usually when I want to go to the beach for sometime, I have to hike for like one hour before reaching a really nice beach (then I stay 30min and I leave because bathing is boring, unless you have parties on the said beach)
[23:07:13] <tharkun> I am having some isues connceting to a SOAP service. IIRC correctly someone in here once told me that a problem would be connecting a new client to  an old server. What is my the cli tool to check the ssl connection?
[23:07:37] <genio> run for the hills. the devil is upon us
[23:08:07] <mst> tharkun: what client are you using?

[23:13:32] <genio> tharkun: Also, what errors are you getting? Is it a SOAP error or an SSL communication error?
[23:14:47] <genio> I should really stop saying SSL when I mean HTTPS probably with TLS
[23:15:11] <tharkun> The error is an undefined variable that should be taken from the SOAP server. So I suspect since it has happened before that there is no actual ssl connection to the SOAP service. I am unable at this point to pinpoint the problem yet I remembered that comment from long ago.
[23:15:23] <tharkun> genio: Thats two of us.
[23:15:23] <mst> and you didn't answer my question
[23:16:08] <mst> did you try making a straight https connection to the server using LWP and trying a 'GET /' ?
[23:16:17] <huf> oh soap, when i had to edit the xsdl thingie to get it to actually work
[23:16:22] <huf> what an adventure that was
[23:16:26] <xaltsc> btw, mst I setup eval $(perl -Mlocal::lib=$HOME/.local) instead, seems to make more sense given the output.
[23:16:41] <tharkun> mst: No, I am looking into the code right now. The default client I use, but since it is called under the hood by XML::Compile I can't recall it.
[23:16:43] <mst> xaltsc: oh, yeah, that makes sense
[23:17:01] <mst> tharkun: the answer to my question was 'XML::Compile' then
[23:17:07] <huf> or whatever extension soap xml whatevers have
[23:17:19] <mst> tharkun: anyway, it'll be LWP
[23:17:30] <mst> tharkun: so try that
[23:17:44] <mst> 'GET /' will presumably fail against a SOAP server, but -how- it fails may help
[23:18:03] <tharkun> mst: Ohh, thanks.
[23:22:13] <tharkun> Ok, so XML::Compile::SOAP11 hitted me in the face once more LWP::Protocol::https is not present and it did not complained about not being present.
[23:22:41] <tharkun> Now the next test is to see if LWP will establish the correct connection using openssl.
[23:23:06] <tharkun> mst: BTW I still ou you a year's provision of coffee ;P
[23:23:12] <genio> cpanm IO::Socket::SSL  LWP::Protocol::https
[23:23:16] <mst> tharkun: aha! yes
[23:26:46] <vague> mst, keep delaying the payment, it'll be worth gold in a couple of years :P
[23:27:37] <mst> tharkun: XML::Compile is very much "you have to get this exactly right" ... but once you do, it actually *works* which is more than I can say for most means of accessing SOAP services
[23:27:58] <mst> tharkun: also file a bug on RT about it, the author will usually respond
[23:28:28] <mst> tharkun: if he gets annoyed by your bug report, just blame me, that will work out fine
[23:29:40] <tharkun> mst: XML::Compile is the ultimate workhorse. It just works and never complains. The isue is that most of the time the ssl connection is a pita to set up correctly. Testing the server for the types of ciphers it is using is now the next step according to my notes. Yet I spilled coffe on the one liner used to do it.
[23:31:10] <mst> tharkun: oh, also, there's a mailing list if you need it
[23:31:48] <mst> seems to've gone silent since 2019
[23:31:56] <mst> but the author has always replied so far as I remember
[23:34:09] <genio> yea, he's generally good about responding to everything on the list
[23:35:33] <mst> that's basically why I created one for him
[23:35:37] <mst> figured he would be :D
