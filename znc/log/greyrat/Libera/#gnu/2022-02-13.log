[02:46:55] <epony> euouae, when it's about GNU with its righteousness and principles, YOU CAN NOT DO THAT.
[02:47:18] <epony> that would be MAJOR SOFTWARE THEFT in violation of the license of the original software
[02:47:25] <epony> YOU CAN NOT BE THAT NAIVE.
[02:47:37] <epony> don't play stupid.
[02:47:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> euouae: diclaimer: and nonsense monolougue starts
[02:48:11] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you should defenately try bsd
[02:48:25] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> there are some good interviews with Theo by the way
[02:48:31] <euouae> epony hmmm? It sounds like it's exactly in line with GPL principles
[02:48:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the founder of openBSD
[02:48:38] <epony> M3RELATIVISM[m], your words make no sense, better pick the real details instead of attacking someone that disagrees with theft and piracy
[02:48:43] <euouae> the ability to modify and redistribute the source?
[02:48:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> in bsd it is reversed also btw
[02:48:47] <epony> GNU defaces software since 1984.
[02:49:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> openBSD is more free in the GNU sense then freeBSD
[02:49:21] <euouae> I was going to try openBSD anyway
[02:49:30] <tesseract> anyone use centos stream here?
[02:49:31] <Inline> what does deface mean ?
[02:49:48] <epony> GNU went around searching for a compiler but the BSD folks declined because it was AT&T's license and the derivative work did not include the ownership of the original system.
[02:50:25] <epony> GNU however decided to steal and copy it anyway, because it had no system of its own and wanted to sell something as a service and books, without having its own system.
[02:50:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> dont feed the troll Inline 
[02:50:52] <euouae> I'm grateful for GNU :) I use Emacs _a lot_ and lately I've been learning a lot from the info pages. I may eventually end up with a job, and it would be in part thanks to the educational material from gnu
[02:50:54] <epony> so GNU defaced UNIX and rewrote it copying lines by removing the original license and identification headers
[02:51:11] <epony> that is how GNU got the NOT UNIX name, it became a defacement project.
[02:51:31] <euouae> epony I've never heard that before.
[02:51:36] <epony> It then got some charity and with that paid for some naive people to write some utilities to replace the defaced ones.
[02:51:38] <Inline> never heard that either
[02:51:41] <euouae> epony Also, it is a tad strange that you'd hang around #gnu with that opinion?
[02:52:00] <Inline> afaik it was a ph.D. thing or so
[02:52:16] <epony> and finally GNU went ot to become a defender of freedoms while it based its tools on theft.
[02:52:17] <Inline> some student was tryin new stuff....
[02:52:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> euouae: nonthing strange about that
[02:52:33] <epony> now, it plans to steal OpenBSD in the same way it stole UNIX.
[02:52:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> epony: only itend is to creat disorganization and friction on this channel
[02:52:48] <euouae> epony are you involved in any projects?
[02:52:50] <epony> then it will call it OpenBSD/GNU.. which is as stupid as it gets
[02:52:57] <Inline> and afaik, even by todays standards there's a sense of enough change to unwarrant the copyright
[02:53:10] <Inline> because it's not the same anymore from some point on....
[02:53:13] <epony> because you can install GNU utilities in OpenBSD today as is out of the bos, without stealing OpenBSD's name and project and system
[02:53:36] <euouae> GNU is more than binutils
[02:53:57] <epony> yeah, it's a major defacement operation as it turns out

[08:39:53] <gevreeen> jxself: I don't suppose you could recommend some hosted free (as in free beer and for gpl projects) git service that's not likely to subject itself to the us export restrictions?
[08:41:33] <jxself> Something that you host?
[08:41:48] <jxself> Or are you also in the United States?
[08:42:32] <jxself> Because anything in the United States would be subject to US law regardless of whether they put stuff about exporting into their terms of service or not.
[08:42:36] <gevreeen> jxself: no, something that someone else hosts
[08:42:42] <jxself> Savannah at least doesn't put that in there so that's good. :)
[08:42:43] <gevreeen> and nope, I'm not in the states phyically
[08:42:52] <gevreeen> s/phyically/physically/
[08:43:02] <jxself> Putting it in the terms of service is just bad policy.
[08:43:20] <jxself> End up with people agreeing to follow US laws, regardless of where they might actually be. Just an awful idea.
[08:43:58] <gevreeen> well, I do need such a service as my local country probably doesn't like my project either

[08:48:00] <jxself> Yes, it used to have a higher rating.
[08:48:09] <jxself> Also, I think the GiLab people are a US company.
[08:48:16] <jxself> Not sure though.
[08:48:40] <gevreeen> google captchas are truly annoying esp. if you country blackhole all google addresses
