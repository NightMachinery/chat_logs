[23:22:38] <maplefinger> someone needs to take the coffee away from buZz
[23:22:51] <buZz> maplefinger: oh what a great argument
[23:22:57] <murthy> morf: ty
[23:23:06] <buZz> totally not a personal attack but really underlining what you tried to argue prior
[23:23:13] * buZz applaus
[23:23:16] <buZz> +d
[23:23:28] <maplefinger> murthy is this his usual act?
[23:23:55] <buZz> pointing out people with lacking arguments? yeah pretty standard
[23:24:13] <buZz> its called discussion
[23:25:25] <morf> only thing i hear is squelching noises some poo 
[23:25:30] <morf> of some*
[23:25:41] <buZz> :P
[23:25:49] <buZz> morf: yeah , its art!

[23:27:03] <buZz> if only it was a 2 usd reproduction poster, then we could call it art by the grace of this one irc user
[23:27:06] <buZz> but alas
[23:27:30] <maplefinger> he thinks I said reproductions are originals.
[23:28:05] <maplefinger> This is like chatting with a DSM-IV turing bot on Markov mode
[23:28:09] <buZz> 20:43:56 < buZz> right, so a photo of the monalisa isnt a photo of art?
[23:28:09] <buZz> 20:44:07 < buZz> how about a poster of a van gogh?
[23:28:09] <buZz> 20:44:10 < maplefinger> yes, it is
[23:28:20] <buZz> DSM-4 is outdated
[23:28:31] <maplefinger> "a photo of art is art" lol incredible
[23:28:45] <maplefinger> yeah but it contains a diagnosis for you :)
[23:28:47] <buZz> you specifically said 20:44:50 < maplefinger> those are known as "reproductions" and their value is essentially in the licensing and the object as an ephemeral simulation
[23:28:58] <buZz> maplefinger: oh thats great,  more personal attacks
[23:29:05] <maplefinger> yes, and now we know your real problem: reading comprehension
[23:29:10] <buZz> really running out of stuff to meaningfully add , right?
[23:29:30] <maplefinger> gonna guess you haven't even wandered into an art class much less a gallery
[23:29:44] <buZz> yeah sure , try to appeal to authority
[23:29:53] <buZz> that will help you hide your lack of arguments
[23:30:11] <maplefinger> you think having experience is a fallacy, amazing
[23:30:26] <buZz> ah , projecting assumptions now

[23:42:33] <maplefinger> I love this, keep it comin buZz
[23:42:54] <buZz> you just messed up and dont want to agree that all -your- art is digital files too
[23:43:02] <maplefinger> someone give buZz a quadruple shot of espresso, he's winding down
[23:43:26] <maplefinger> OOO he's morphed from strawman factory into mind-reader!
[23:43:43] <maplefinger> This is a unique defense never before seen on IRC.  "You just don't have stuff, that's why you are dumb"
[23:43:53] <maplefinger> "I know because I am outside your window"
[23:43:58] <buZz> no you're totally right, its preposterous that anyone should ever find a way to monetize their digital art
[23:44:17] <maplefinger> I touched the "nft bad" part of his brain, it seems
[23:44:17] <buZz> better shame the whole way so nobody falls for it
[23:44:19] <buZz> what fools
[23:44:28] <buZz> i own zero nfts nor issued any
[23:44:39] <maplefinger> you also dont know anything about nft
[23:44:41] <buZz> i have other way to get paid for digital art, like performances and installations
[23:44:46] <maplefinger> but thats entirely beside the point.
[23:44:51] <maplefinger> You've come here to have an Argument.
[23:45:05] <buZz> yeah what a fool i am

[23:47:50] <buZz> the torrent all files point to is some digital files 
[23:47:53] <buZz> so clearly not art
[23:48:16] <buZz> and completely unrelated to whatever that site says it contains :)
[23:48:31] <maplefinger> hmm actually... tracker says otherwise :)
[23:48:38] <buZz> but hey, lets not look into things we think justify our points and accept them at face point
[23:48:50] <buZz> -that tracker- is fake

[23:49:45] <buZz> yes, now go look at the infohash for each torrent

[23:52:18] <buZz> having a reproduction jpeg of a item doesnt mean you have rights of ownership of that reproduction jpeg
[23:52:49] <buZz> similar to how taking the bus doesnt make you its owner

[23:55:33] <buZz> you could just run a max caching ipfs server to get most of these too , if you really wanted

[23:58:47] <buZz> you can however, as a artist make some agreement with a buyer
