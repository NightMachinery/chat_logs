[07:04:52] <gry> i have read definition of slander it says "slander: n. oral defamation, in which someone tells one or more persons an untruth about another which untruth will harm the reputation of the person defamed."
[07:05:23] <gry> so if i come to irc to whine about illogical behaviour of my niece that drives me crazy, and from my description makes my niece look stupid, does that qualify as slander?
[07:24:02] <vonunov> gry: Written defamation is libel; slander is oral. The practically relevant legal definition varies, of course. But in Texas, for example: "Not all untrue communications are actionable. Specifically, the law recognizes that an assertion of a subjective opinion does not necessarily represent a statement of fact and therefore will not support a defamation claim." There are many more facets to how
[07:24:08] <vonunov> this would turn out, so if you were to ask a law chat/forum they would probably be limited in their ability to evaluate a hypothetical. But it sounds like it's more difficult to actually commit libel than the dictionary definition makes it sound like: "By contrast, a communication that is merely unflattering, abusive, annoying, irksome, or embarrassing ... or that only hurts a person's feelings,
[07:24:14] <vonunov> is not actionable." https://freemanlaw.com/defamation/

[07:27:47] <twb> gry is in australia which has even stricter libel law than UK
[07:29:58] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Porter#Rape_allegation  recent relevant case law
[07:30:40] <gry> so if i come here and every day write 'my niece did X' where X is stupid and i am clearly wishing others to know this, then it's libel
[07:30:49] <gry> where X is different from day to day
[07:31:46] <gry> eg 'my niece today whined instead of doing his homework' 'my niece today went at his playmate with fists' 'my niece put water in his pc'
[07:32:21] <twb> gry: AIUI pretty much anything an Australian journalist says, any person mentioned can say "PROVE IT OR ELSE" and the burden of proof is on the journalist
[07:32:32] <gry> suppose it's true
[07:32:50] <twb> gry: it's a little different if 1) you're a private citizen; and/or 2) the person wasn't "damaged" by the claim
[07:33:00] <gry> but i selectively pick only stupid things my niece does. i dont share how my niece went to the moon or watered a garden. i only select the stupid things and complain of them
[07:33:14] <gry> i'm a citizen
[07:33:31] <twb> gry: my point is, you're not a professional journalist
[07:33:42] <gry> the person doesnt know, but maybe ten years later they apply for a job and their future employer goes 'hmm.. gry wrote nasty things of you on irc for the last ten years'
[07:33:47] <gry> i'm not journalist
[07:34:18] <gry> for the record, i'm watching someone do something similar to what i'm describing. and i'd like to convince that 'someone' that what they're doing is not nice
[07:34:38] <gry> if i tell them 'hey it's libel' theyll say 'hey gry, but it's true and i'm not a journalist'
[07:34:55] <gry> so i am trying to come up with an accurate word or phrase to put after the 'hey it's ...'
[07:36:43] <twb> https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/business-law/christian-porters-defamation-action-slightly-technical-overview  discusses the ABC defamation case
[07:36:45] <gry> it doesn't have to be a legal term. just a concise word
[07:37:39] <twb> https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/porter/13267834  is the Media Watch episode
[07:40:34] <twb> gry: anyway.  My argument would be more along the lines of personal attacks are not constructive or helpful.
[07:43:28] <gry> it is not a 'you are a donkey' kind of personal attack
[07:43:45] <gry> so they would say it's not attack at a person, it's an attack at an action
[07:44:08] <gry> i could argue that they're being biased in what they select, but they'd say "but it's true" and "but one in 1000 times, i share something positive too"
[07:45:40] <gry> it is probably 'selection bias'
[07:46:15] <gry> but is there a name for it? when i come to my neighbour and tell him only the not-nice-or-logical things my niece does, carefully working (perhaps subconsciously) to not mention anything that the niece is doing well?
[07:46:56] <twb> 'sampling bias' is what I'd have said
[07:47:06] <twb> if you don't know you're doing it, possibly 'systemic bias'
[07:50:44] <gry> twb: it seems conscious, with a thought that whining would lead to advice being given.
[07:50:56] <gry> so it's conscious sampling bias

[17:28:51] <kurahaupo> StayHungry: Note: crossbreeding wolves with pigeons is difficult because the wolves want to eat the pigeons, and the pigeons want to fly away. But if you succeed, you get a flyer that's excellent in a dogfight.

[17:37:01] <TimMc> StayHungry: Really, what you have is a family of birds (the Columbidae) where the individual species have common names including "dove" or "pigeon", but not in any consistent way.
[17:37:42] <pussipupu> It varies a lot by register
[17:37:52] <TimMc> Hah! Apparently "dove" (noun, a bird) is related to "dove" (verb of movement, past tense).
[17:38:04] <pussipupu> In common tongue it's generally that white ones are doves
[17:38:21] <pussipupu> Like ducks being called that because they duck
[17:38:35] <furrykef> Didn't know that about doves. I did know that about ducks.

[17:39:04] <TimMc> (Wikipedia overstated its source there.)

[17:41:00] <furrykef> Doves are a symbol of peace; pigeons are those birds that crap on your car.
[17:41:40] <StayHungry> 'dove' is a brand of creamy soap as well :)
[17:41:42] <pussipupu> Hooded crows are a symbol of suave
[17:42:21] <pussipupu> Dove is technically not soap, they made a big thing of that a while back in their adverts
[17:42:41] <pussipupu> but colloquially detergents are referred to as soaps even when they aren't
[17:43:59] <furrykef> "Crow" vs. "raven" is another hard one, though the difference isn't quite as fuzzy.
[17:44:18] <furrykef> Ravens are generally bigger, but there are large crows and small ravens.
[17:45:07] <TimMc> I thought raven was a pretty specific term.
[17:45:46] <TimMc> ok huh, I guess there are a bunch
[17:46:36] <TimMc> Around here we just have one kind of raven (big!) and a couple kinds of crow.
[17:47:22] <pussipupu> Hooded and carrion crows differ literally only in colouration and stay distinct by refusing to interbreed

[18:02:38] <moniker--> there is something about the nature of truth in philosophical sense where someone pointed that particular pragmatic notion of truth rings very similar to the phrase arrow flies true
[18:02:39] <TimMc> or "trued" I guess
[18:02:58] <moniker--> and i'm trying to decode what that means
[18:03:08] <furrykef> "true" (or rather "trēowe") meant "faithful" in Old English... so actually this is the original meaning of the word
[18:03:13] <LuisP14> just true :x
[18:03:27] <moniker--> ah faithfull gives me a hint i think im getting it
[18:03:46] <TimMc> "Truing a wheel" means adjusting the spokes so that the wheel is straightened out and doesn't have wobbles or deviations.
[18:03:48] <moniker--> if it works it's true
[18:04:09] <TimMc> (I recently trued the wheels on my bike.)

[21:46:36] <cthulchu_> StayHungry, yes, I played for a bit in a bunch of them. Still, I find books a lot better. But it's not really my genre anyway. I'm more into sci-fi and fantasy rather than horror. Lovecraft and King are exceptions.
[21:47:32] <cthulchu_> oh, also someone recently showed me a cool playlist on Lovecraft. It's a lot of lulz for anyone who's familiar with the universe :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYjCIor2C7E&list=PLnOqXuI4qaiiio-QIlG5T-QbqinA8F7e6&index=3
