[01:25:06] <f-a> I am thinking how to pass additional information (FPS, whether screen size has changed) without turning functions head over heels…

[04:02:58] <sm> not having access to IO during an ansi-terminal-game kind of forces me into restarting it for each level (if I want to update state on disk at end of each level). This means there's both a-t-g's notion of a game, and player's notion of a game.
[04:03:48] <sm> also it means when I'm showing a high score / level complete message, that has not yet been saved to disk, and if they ctrl-C it would turn out to be a lie
[04:04:01] <sm> I guess I could use unsafe IO
[04:16:39] <ManofLetters[m]> it hurts a little the first time
[04:22:01] <sm> I'll be an unsafe fiend

[10:42:41] <icrbow[m]> an engine can provide a separate post-frame callback that has read-only access to world and stuff, but can do `IO ()`.

[16:41:49] <tristanC[m]> f-a: not sure what do you mean by adding FPS, but this article describes a good design: https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/
[16:42:17] <f-a> thanks tristanC[m] 
[16:44:01] <f-a> I just meant: adding the ability for the end user to display current FPS. It seems «easy» but it is not, as none of the two logic/draw functions carry the information https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ansi-terminal-game-1.5.0.0/docs/Terminal-Game.html#t:Game
[16:47:32] <f-a> very interesting article
[16:48:16] <tristanC[m]> @f-a it seems like you would need access to the system time in order to measure how long it takes to render a tick
[16:50:19] <f-a> my choice (well, my idea for now, I am exploring possibilities, comments welcome!) is to have the logic function become slightly different
[16:50:34] <f-a> logic :: CurrFPS -> s -> Event -> s           
[16:51:01] <tristanC[m]> oh i see, you are the author of ansi-terminal-game and you want to provide FPS to the library user?
[16:51:15] <f-a> ah! Yes sorry, I was not clear enough. I am!
[16:51:59] <tristanC[m]> well, for example, in Terminal.Game.Layer.Imperative.gameLoop you could add something like: https://gitlab.com/sheaf/fir/-/blob/master/fir-examples/examples/apps/FIR/Examples/Toy/Application.hs#L859-880
[16:52:58] <tristanC[m]> omiting the `delay` call if you don't want to cap the speed
[16:53:22] <f-a> ohh writing an IORef, interesting idea
