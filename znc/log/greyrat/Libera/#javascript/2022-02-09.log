[00:47:21] <tlf> I'm doing some hobby coding for a browser that only supports javascript 1.5/1.6 (and not even fully). getElementById doesn't seem to exist in these versions. How can I select an element and set it's display to block/none in this case?

[00:48:59] <tlf> thanks ljharb. Yes, it was released in 2000 - pretty old :) Was there a way to change display type at all back then?

[00:49:55] <hassoon_> ow meh
[00:49:56] <ljharb> tlf: why do you care about this browser, which is older than IE 6?
[00:50:03] <hassoon_> outdated response
[00:50:25] <RLa> what if you try window.yourElementId to get the element
[00:50:36] <ljharb> tlf: note tho that in DOM0, you can select elements by ID just by using the ID as a global variable.
[00:50:37] <RLa> not sure if .style was supported back then
[00:50:50] <tlf> fair enough. Might look into soem alternatives like tables. It runs on Amiga, which a few of us are still using - that's the only reason :) http://ibrowse-dev.net
[00:51:01] <ljharb> tlf: surely that's not the newest browser that can run on it
[00:51:09] <ljharb> tlf: but also, that's so old it can't connect to HTTPS anymore
[00:51:16] <ljharb> tlf: so it's basically cut off from the entire modern internet

[00:51:42] <systemfault> (even if it was supported)
[00:51:52] <ljharb> even IE 6 can't connect to SSL anymore
[00:51:59] <tlf> RLa I'll try that. ljharb: it's a 14Mhz machine. But it does have SSL support :)

[00:52:31] <tlf> You can play Youtube on Amiga.
[00:52:42] <systemfault> tlf: In 4k, of course!
[00:52:49] <ljharb> tlf: iow, the SSL that IE 6 and 7 supports has been cracked, so no modern webserver still accepts those protocols
[00:53:04] <ljharb> tlf: ok well if youtube works than that means the ssl certs are updated, which also means you can get a modern browser

[02:06:19] <peteyboy1> ljharb, oh, i guess i've been doing it wrong about half the time
[02:06:24] <ljharb> there we go
[02:06:26] <peteyboy1> do i repeat then?
[02:06:28] <ljharb> please
[02:06:44] <peteyboy1> is it wise to have an isAuth global variable that switches between true, false and "loading"? or is it better for it to switch between true and false, and then have a separate "loading" variable that switches between true and false? i fail to see the benefits of the latter
[02:06:51] <ljharb> global variables are always the worst choice

[02:09:49] *** Quits: Codaraxis (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:10:23] <ljharb> yes
[02:10:35] <ljharb> peteyboy1: altho there's probably a better answer, i just lack the context
[02:10:54] <ljharb> for example, render a "loading" component when loading, and render an entirely distinct component when not
[02:11:06] <ljharb> and the true/false would only be a prop for the latter
[02:11:49] <peteyboy1> ljharb, that's the idea yes, a loading screen while checking if logged in, and then redirecting to login screen or dashboard, depending on whether it's true or false
[02:12:00] <peteyboy1> not much more context i can provide
[02:12:27] <ljharb> then yeah "loading" isn't a prop, it's state that determines which component you render
[02:13:01] <ljharb> if you want a single three-state thing, then that's fine too.

[17:57:14] <austincheney> stenno, in my application I put some websocket messages behind timeouts because if you attempt to send two messages at once there is a 50% chance only one of them will be sent.

[17:58:16] <stenno> is it even technically possible to send two messages at the same time
[17:58:56] <austincheney> yes, because the network handler from the browser is slower than executing lines of code within the same function

[18:02:16] <austincheney> maybe, websocket is a single bidirectional tunnel.  Since messages, except control frames, cannot be interleaved if the socket receives two or messages faster than it can send them it will ignore the additional messages
[18:02:56] <austincheney> I don't if that also applies to messages being sent at the same time as frames are being received, as that is an extremely diffecult scenario to test
[18:04:13] <austincheney> i dont know if that is a bug or not.  If you believe it to be a bug you can always raise an issue with the Chromium team.
[18:04:15] <EdFletcher> austincheney: I’m aware of how websockets work but that doesn’t prevent you from sending simultaneously from your application layer, the library should handle serializing the frames onto the transport layer. Hence why it sounds like a bug. I’ve used websockets so many times and run into this issue.

[18:06:52] <austincheney> in these timeouts I use a 25ms delay, which is super safe.  I bet a 0 second delay is probably safe as well, but I have not tested that.
[18:07:21] <EdFletcher> that seems like a high enough failure rate that you can’t be the only person in the world who would be hitting this regularly if it were expected behavior…
[18:08:06] <EdFletcher> and since millions of sites use high-volume websockets every day and millions of their users use chrome… you kinda have to conclude it’s a “you” problem.

[20:49:45] <timwis> Hi all. You know how on a normal html page, if you submit a form, then press the back button, the form values you filled in are still there? SPAs break this feature, and im trying to restore it in my (sveltekit) app. So I’m just trying to understand how browsers do it in the first place.
[20:50:37] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[20:50:47] <timwis> Im assuming the reason they break is because the form elements are missing when you press the back button, and later added by JS. So it should work on server rendered forms, but for isomorphic apps that’s useless in practice because the back button would always be client side routing (unless navigating back from another site)

[23:18:41] <jaawerth> if any of those operations are likely to be used again in other contexts, try to pull them out into smaller named functons. then mix and match the styles a bit - promise chains can look pretty nice with named functions and you can massage then with await, rather than going full-await
[23:18:45] <jaawerth> this always applies to error handlers
[23:19:42] <austincheney> jwpapi, your concern is all about trade offs.  If you want to write code that is highly declarative like that you will have a lot variables.  You are hiding what is happening behind the scenes behind functional methods and assigning each step to a variable.  The alternative is an imperative approach where you abstract away less and require fewer variables
[23:20:33] <jaawerth> weait what that is quite imperative

[23:21:36] <jwpapi> jaawerth: at the moment not really
[23:22:43] <jwpapi> I keep running in that problem. I write a lot of code that requires a couple of operations and I try to write it non-mutating and to use array functions.
[23:23:52] <austincheney> jwpapi, as an experiment try rewriting that code not using compositional array methods and see what the end result looks like.  Then you can choose which approach you like more.

[23:24:41] <jaawerth> the problem IMO is anonymous functions - like, you prbobably need to invoke .getInsights in other contexts

[23:25:52] <jwpapi> hmm there are a couple of concepts I need to read into first

[23:29:01] <jaawerth> though one thing - I do agree it can be more imperative in places like the e._data.id. I'd just grab that. the .catch and log stuff you can usually replace across an entire ccodebase with one or two util functions.  the (e) => e[0]._data stuff.. it depends
