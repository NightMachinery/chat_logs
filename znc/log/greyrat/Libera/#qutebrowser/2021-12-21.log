[00:02:57] <ectospasm> I skimmed through the FAQ, and I don't see any mention of how to install Chromium/Chrome extensions.
[00:03:09] <Ingvix> you can't
[00:03:22] <ectospasm> OK, then that answers my question.
[00:03:43] <ectospasm> I would have thought since QtWebEngine is based on Chromium, it would have been possible.
[00:03:55] <The-Compiler> Ingvix: that doesn't make much sense on the request level, that's a different API (acceptNavigationRequest)
[00:04:17] <The-Compiler> ectospasm: extensions mostly live in the UI/browser layer of Chromium
[00:05:59] <ectospasm> Hmmm, OK.  The main thing I was looking for is integrating my password manager with qutebrowser.  I use LastPass (been a paying subscriber since before the free version went to one platform only).
[00:06:00] <Ingvix> huh, then can I set it to do what I wish to achieve or is it in the works?
[00:06:41] <The-Compiler> Ingvix: there is no exposed API for it so far I think
[00:07:01] <Ingvix> I see, that's a shame
[00:07:29] <Ingvix> maybe some day
[00:08:07] <The-Compiler> ectospasm: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/misc/userscripts/qute-lastpass
[00:20:49] <ectospasm> The-Compiler:  Ohh, OK.  Very interesting.  
[00:21:48] <ectospasm> I'm new to qutebrowser, do you have documentation on how to load those userscripts?  The qute-lastpass script itself doesn't provide that basic guidance.
[00:23:26] <Ingvix> ectospasm, :spawn --userscript <name>
[00:23:53] <Ingvix> more info about :spawn also in :help :spawn
[00:24:15] <Ingvix> uh, assuming you got the docs included
[00:25:47] <Ingvix> you'll probably want to bind the commands to some key with :bind as well
[00:27:18] <ectospasm> Ingvix: yep, I'm able to find the docs with `:help :spawn`.  Looks like I need to install the tldextract python module.

[00:39:24] <ectospasm> OK, lpass is broken for me, doesn't seem to accept my password (which I know is correct).  But that's not a qutebrowser issue.
[01:02:16] <ectospasm> Figured out my issue, at least with lpass...  I had to increase the number of iterations to 100100 (see https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli/issues/604)
[01:03:19] <ectospasm> Now qutebrowser doesn't seem to be able to read my lpass environment.  Do I need to launch qutebrowser from the shell that I ran lpass login in?  Not sure how I can have qutebrowser prompt me for my LastPass master password.
