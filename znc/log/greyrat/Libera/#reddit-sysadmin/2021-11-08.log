[00:03:07] <rpifan> did u know in germany there is only one kind of ground beef
[00:03:16] <rpifan> there isnt this thing where you can choose how much fat it has
[00:03:19] <rpifan> you just get what you get
[00:03:22] <rpifan> and you are happy

[00:04:17] *** Telvana is now known as Rob
[00:04:17] <rpifan> i did find there is a new kind of ground beef tho where they mix like 15 percent with vegetables
[00:04:23] <rpifan> so if you want leaner ground beef you buy that thing
[00:04:25] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> Europe is so weird and controlling in a lot of ways

[00:04:41] <rpifan> yea sometimes it is weir
[00:04:44] <fritzwastaken> we would just throw in more fat and remix it
[00:04:51] <fritzwastaken> until it got to the right percentage that we needed
[00:04:56] <fritzwastaken> we had a vat of beef fat cubes
[00:05:25] <rpifan> how do u make it leaner ?
[00:05:36] <fritzwastaken> we would start it lean
[00:05:38] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> Use lean cuts first
[00:05:43] <ender> I can go to butcher in any store and tell them to gring me whatever meat I want
[00:05:44] <fritzwastaken> meat cutters would trim all the fat off and mix it
[00:06:00] <fritzwastaken> then we would add back in the fat cubes to get it to the right mix
[00:06:19] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> Idk how they get 99% lean beef though
[00:06:21] <rpifan> also you cant get ground turkey or ground chicken very easily
[00:06:31] <rpifan> i asked the butcher at the big supermarekt
[00:06:34] <rpifan> and they said due to eu rules
[00:06:35] <Jaelae> i make everything with ground turkey
[00:06:40] <rpifan> about mixing poultry
[00:06:41] <rpifan> and such
[00:07:04] <rpifan> also something i learnt recently, least you think all european food is better and fresher
[00:07:19] <rpifan> if you buy chicken parts in a cointainer, they are actually packed in co2
[00:07:54] <rpifan> so we dont have those typical yellow styrofoam trays where you can get fresh meat parts
[00:08:23] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> I know European eggs aren't allowed to be washed
[00:08:30] <CptLuxx> You're an idiot of course you get different ground meat

[00:08:33] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> And American eggs are usually washed
[00:08:43] <CptLuxx> They nix you the fat content...
[00:09:38] <rpifan> yes but only at the large supermarket / butches
[00:09:45] <rpifan> the local netto only has one kind of meat
[00:09:57] <CptLuxx> Netto...
[00:10:08] <CptLuxx> The cheapest of them all
[00:10:25] <fritzwastaken> I love the germans simply because of Lidl and Aldi
[00:10:32] <fritzwastaken> Lidl is my weekly grocery store
[00:10:36] <fritzwastaken> fuckin love it
[00:10:49] <fritzwastaken> I hate going to american grocery stores now other than Safeway for meat
[00:11:08] <rpifan> CptLuxx, yea but also aldi lidl all of them really 
[00:11:16] <rpifan> only if you are lucky to have a butcher section in the shop
[00:11:20] <rpifan> and its usually like 3 times as expensive
[00:11:23] <CptLuxx> Then don't go to the cheap ones
[00:11:25] <CptLuxx> Lol
[00:12:13] <CptLuxx> "I want all the expensive stuff for cheap at my cheap ass market!!"
[00:29:40] <fritzwastaken> I have the most amazing local butcher shop I go to
[00:29:57] <fritzwastaken> ive been stuck behind trucks of live cows going to this shop before
[00:30:20] <fritzwastaken> there was one a prison break where cows were roaming my towns streets after breaking out of a truck
[00:30:31] <fritzwastaken> Freshest goddam meat ever
[00:30:54] <fritzwastaken> My last 3 xmas prime rib roasts came from there
[00:31:58] <technonerd> I smoked prime rib last year for Christmas 
[00:32:00] <technonerd> Delish 
[00:32:04] <technonerd> Juicy meat 
[00:32:24] <fritzwastaken> We Sousvide a massive prime rib and then seared it off on my dads grill/smoker
[00:32:39] <fritzwastaken> It was so good
[00:33:19] <fritzwastaken> my parents biggest stress point about holidays was the primary meat, turkey for t-day and roast/meatballs for xmas. My wife took over the task
[00:33:26] <fritzwastaken> and now its so much better than my childhood
[00:33:53] <mistiry> i usually do turkey for both.
[00:33:58] <mistiry> because i fucking love that meal
[00:34:04] <mistiry> favorite meal ever
[00:34:39] <fritzwastaken> We do swedish meatballs for xmas, cause my family is swedish, and turkey for t-day
[00:34:51] <fritzwastaken> but now we are moving to prime rib
[00:35:16] <technonerd> It was a crime to eat, just slicing it up was heavenly

[02:09:48] <A-KO> every time DST switches people get all up in arms about the change. The reality is it kind of aligns us a little better with the daylight hours as the earth rotates.
[02:09:55] <A-KO> that's about it
[02:10:06] <A-KO> it's not an exact 'science' to the matter because otherwise we'd be adjusting every day
[02:10:20] <catbeard> my doodads changed over but my alarm clock didn't
[02:10:21] <Work-BWMerlin> It does no such thing, it causes a heap of medical conditions and there is no benifit to it
[02:10:22] <catbeard> lol
[02:10:27] <A-KO> personally, I like the extra hours in the evening in the summer
[02:11:10] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> i hate it regardless of the pros, i just wanna stick to a single time and just let the sun do it's thing
[02:11:19] <A-KO> if we stayed on permanent non-DST time then there'd be a heap of studies showing how SAD is much more impactful in the US now, etc etc.
[02:11:31] <A-KO> you can find studies for just about anything :)
[02:11:46] <JollyRgrs> ^^

[02:13:04] <A-KO> for example, DC/Baltimore's sunset is around 30 minutes later than Los Angeles' at the summer's solstice--the opposite is true during the winter's solstice
[02:13:12] <Work-BWMerlin> No DST here and it is perfect
[02:13:30] <A-KO> summertime hours in Seattle can easily have daylight well into 9:30PM or later
[02:13:35] <A-KO> with 'twilight' being like 10:30PM at night lol
[02:14:04] <A-KO> so what people prefer/want is entirely different depending on where ya live
[02:14:23] <Work-BWMerlin> If we wanted to better align with the day/night cycle we won't use alarm clocks the way we do and instead have the time adjust daily to take into account sun rise and sun set
[02:14:40] <A-KO> sure. But again, not an exact science and that'd be too confusing for everyone.
[02:14:51] <A-KO> "Today you're scheduled for work at 8:36AM. Tomorrow, 8:34AM"

[13:56:53] <Activ8> happy monday
[13:56:57] <lancehead> bet @ SirSceptalot 
[13:57:09] <Activ8> been super busy this morning never stopped but now I can chill
[13:57:26] <lancehead> Same here. Had a new employee at the reception downstairs 
[13:57:39] <lancehead> I'd go downstairs, set something up for her, then get a call ten minutes later to set something up again 
[13:57:39] <teh_f4ll3n> boss wants me to be in 2 places at the same time this afternoon
[13:57:41] <lancehead> Five times 
[14:01:15] <SirSceptalot> Five new hires in a day? How many people work there?
[14:01:32] <lancehead> No, same hire calling five times 
[14:01:52] <SirSceptalot> oooooh
[14:02:02] <lancehead> While I was also busy configuring two laptops upstairs 
[14:02:22] <lancehead> And fixing someone's login 
[14:02:39] <lancehead> I've been at work for 2.5hrs and am just now sitting on my butt lol

[14:15:00] <Activ8> I just had to re-enable an account that a guy I work with disabled lol - it's their invoice email to pay bills to us.
[14:16:12] <teh_f4ll3n> do I go all the way across town to oversee a WAN line upgrade, or do I go to the datacentre to finally start the upgrades I've been planning for 2 minths?
[14:16:21] <teh_f4ll3n> s/minths/months
[14:16:23] <layer8> teh_f4ll3n meant: "do I go all the way across town to oversee a WAN line upgrade, or do I go to the datacentre to finally start the upgrades I've been planning for 2 months?"
[14:17:08] <teh_f4ll3n> Boss thinks I can do both :D lol
[14:17:11] <lancehead> I vote datacenter 
[14:17:30] <xe0n> do the upgrade first
[14:17:33] <xe0n> then datacenter
[14:17:41] <xe0n> if dc has taken this long, it can wait
[14:17:45] <xe0n> get the wan shit sorted
[14:18:33] <lancehead> Hmm. Define "oversee" @ teh_f4ll3n
[14:19:02] <teh_f4ll3n> let the ISP tech into the comms room to get a new modem installed
[14:19:07] <teh_f4ll3n> :-/
[14:19:32] <lancehead> ..there's no one else around that can do that?
[14:19:40] <xe0n> okay dont complain when if it goes south :P
[14:20:21] <teh_f4ll3n> Boss can drive out, I guess
[14:20:36] <teh_f4ll3n> xe0n, it could wait 2 months ago.
[14:20:44] <teh_f4ll3n> not anymore
[14:21:01] <lancehead> You could also let the tech in, then just leave to go do your thing 
[14:21:30] <lancehead> Or just do datacenter first so that when your boss calls about the other thing, you can tell him you're in the middle of something which is more important ;) 
[14:21:56] <xe0n> yeahhh i'd do wan link first, sort that out, schedule a full day at the dc
[14:22:37] <teh_f4ll3n> https://i.imgur.com/L9vVaJw.png
[14:23:02] <teh_f4ll3n> I already have scheduled the DC. Boss rang this morning
[14:23:09] <teh_f4ll3n> literally all my notice
[14:23:57] <teh_f4ll3n> DC was scheduled a week ago and has been in my calendar since
[14:24:23] <lancehead> Then that comes first, no? 
[14:24:45] <teh_f4ll3n> that's what I told the boss
[14:24:45] <lancehead> that appointment was made before the ISP one, so if he wants someone there for the ISP tech, he's gotta go do that 
[14:24:48] <SirSceptalot> the easy thing for us to say is "he made the mess/double booking, he can fix it himself". Obviously, that doesn't actually help you at all.
[14:24:48] <lancehead> Because you're booked lol 
[14:25:22] <lancehead> It might not SirSceptalot, but it also doesn't make it any less the case 
[14:25:29] <teh_f4ll3n> he booked the tech without looking at my calendar. I told him as much
[14:27:06] <lancehead> I'd just prioritize your DC appointment. It *is* his mistake, and he should be mature enough to take responsibility for it 
[14:27:17] <lancehead> (And that's coming from a 20 year old, can you imagine)
[14:27:43] <teh_f4ll3n> I have the keys at home though
[14:27:53] <lancehead> That... does complicate things 
[14:27:55] <teh_f4ll3n> because WFH
[14:28:00] <xe0n> yeahhh and i'd be doing the wan link and rescheduling the dc for tomorrow if time permits, something that can affect others and cause a possible visit anyway, best to get it done, dc can wait
[14:28:24] <teh_f4ll3n> it doesn't I have the entire rest of the week booked
[14:28:57] <teh_f4ll3n> customer data migrations and shit
[14:29:06] <lancehead> In that case I'd leave keys at the office and go do your thing 
[14:29:39] <SirSceptalot> How long is the drive to comms room? At what time is the ISP set to arrive? How long is the drive between comms and DC? Is your boss a reasonable man?

[14:30:38] <lancehead> Sounds like no on the last question, if he's expected to split himself like a bacteria because his boss can't plan properly LOL 
[14:31:01] *** Joins: csrf (~csrf@user/csrf)
[14:31:07] <teh_f4ll3n> DC scheduled for 2pm-5pm. tech is 3pm I think. about an hour's drive. Boss is also busy lol
[14:31:09] <lancehead> That was my idea as well SirSceptalot. Drop keys at office, email boss, go do your work 
[14:31:30] <lancehead> Also, is rescheduling the tech not an option?
[14:31:38] <teh_f4ll3n> there's no one else since my underling left before the pandemic
[14:31:40] <xe0n> if you can't prioritise, you ask your boss and say which one am i doing because either one could have an impact
[14:31:41] <xe0n> easy
[14:31:48] <xe0n> let him make the call, if there's problems, it's on him
[14:31:52] <SirSceptalot> Well it's not because he didn't check the calender that he doesn't understand the issue created by it. He might not know the importance of the DC work. All stuff only teh_f4ll3n knows
[14:32:02] <lancehead> Idk what it's like over there, but here you can generally reschedule a tech on the day itself 
[14:32:07] <xe0n> i'd prefer my team to do that to me, and i can make the call, and i'll take the heat if there's any
[14:32:21] <teh_f4ll3n> I told him to reschedule, he hasn't replied
[14:32:38] <teh_f4ll3n> knowing him, he hasn't even read the message yet
[14:32:41] <lancehead> In that case I'd say you've done all you could 
[14:32:44] <xe0n> then call?
[14:32:44] <teh_f4ll3n> and he won't until tomorrow
[14:32:54] <teh_f4ll3n> phone off - meetings

[14:33:44] <teh_f4ll3n> I did make the call
[14:33:47] <lancehead> You told him there's a scheduling issue, if he's ignoring it then there's not much you can do lol 
[14:34:05] <teh_f4ll3n> he's been hounding me about the datacentre for weeks. He's gonna get that
[14:34:17] <lancehead> Well there ya go 
[14:34:44] <lancehead> Brb, switching to phone
[14:34:53] <teh_f4ll3n> the office is 10 minute walk from the datacentre
[14:35:01] <SirSceptalot> about the ISP thing: is this a migration from one to the other? Will shit stop working if this isn't done now? At worst, if ISP goes and nobody answers the door they'll just reschedule
[14:35:06] <teh_f4ll3n> I'll drop the keys in and he can do whatever
[14:35:23] <teh_f4ll3n> no, just an upgrade from 500M to 1G

[19:23:06] <erpderp32> I do have one technical hang up that I have been drawing a blank on for a week ... GPO replication. There are 20+ DCs in this org, and one of primary 4 at the datacenter is "Inaccessible" on the status check. Repadmin show no errors whatsoever, dsdiag has no errors. But I have basically isolated it down to this primary datacenter DC being the only
[19:23:07] <erpderp32> one trying to replicate to the site DCs, thus causing a problem because it has no new files to replicate out. Not sure what else to try. And naturally this is FRS because DFSR migration was started, then stopped halfway through implementation a few years back.
[19:23:13] <erpderp32> Any ideas would be appreciated:(
[19:23:55] *** Quits: SpeakerToMeat (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:24:17] <AnonymooseReddtr> does it actually exist?
[19:24:17] <DrZak> have you had an USN rollback?
[19:24:22] <erpderp32> My concern is we are looking at a full project to redo the migration and fix it all - which wouldn't be the worst because I would like to cut the numbers of DCs down to like 4
[19:24:24] <erpderp32> total
[19:24:36] <AnonymooseReddtr> what DC is your FSMO role holder
[19:24:47] <erpderp32> AnonymooseReddtr: The GPO does. I verified it replicated to 3 servers after being created on the primary
[19:24:52] <sd> 12<K​anye> Guessing not that one
[19:25:12] <sd> 12<K​anye> That is weird
[19:25:40] <DrZak> i mean if it is just one DC

[19:25:51] <DrZak> and be done with it in 3 hrs
[19:25:57] <DrZak> not screw around for a week
[19:25:57] <DrZak> :)
[19:26:43] <erpderp32> So the datacenter has 4 primaries.  1, 2, 3, and 4. They all show replication to each other, but 3 is inaccessible. GPO replicated to 1,2, and a site DC (5) that also showed replication to 4 but not to any other externals when I checked the summary csv. So we have it on 1,2,4,5 - not on 3 - and not on any other site DCs that tried to replicate
[19:26:44] <erpderp32> from 3 or each other
[19:26:45] <sd> 12<K​anye> Demote reinstall is what I had to do when one of my DC started doing weird shit and throwing kerberos errors

[20:40:03] * teh_f4ll3n gets the shotgun
[20:40:04] <spiderman> oddly enough
[20:40:16] <A-KO> portland isn't that weird. It's like the west coast's version of the research triangle
[20:40:26] * teh_f4ll3n is hunting for a turkey
[20:40:27] <spiderman> teh_f4ll3n: I think shotguns are illegal for turkey hunting
[20:40:35] <A-KO> once you get outside of Portland if you're any complexion darker than white paint you gotta watch out
[20:40:44] * teh_f4ll3n gets a .50 BMG
[20:40:47] <spiderman> turkeys have too much down, they'd survive a shotgun blast.
[20:41:13] <A-KO> you fly into portland, you fly out of portland. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.
[20:41:35] <teh_f4ll3n> spiderman, not if it's buckshot :D
[20:41:39] <spiderman> nah man portland is really weird
[20:41:52] <spiderman> the people you see outside are bizarre
[20:42:29] <TurkeyGibby> so you fit right in
[20:42:53] <A-KO> Portland Demographics
[20:42:53] <A-KO> According to the most recent ACS, the racial composition of Portland was:
[20:42:53] <A-KO> White: 77.38%
[20:42:53] <A-KO> Asian: 8.18%
[20:42:53] <A-KO> Black or African American: 5.80%
[20:42:54] <teh_f4ll3n> there's a thing on youtube about how (I think) Portland has become a tent ghetto since the BLM riots
[20:42:54] <A-KO> Two or more races: 5.34%
[20:43:12] <A-KO> aint nothing weird about Portland :P
[20:43:17] <A-KO> it's Pleasantville
[20:43:18] <A-KO> lol
[20:43:54] <rpifan> hm
[20:44:03] <spiderman> are you suggesting that non-whites are weird? 
[20:44:24] *** Joins: jab416171 (~jab416171@c-67-182-209-82.hsd1.ut.comcast.net)
[20:44:37] <A-KO> I'm suggesting that Portland is hugely homogenous and not diverse :P
[20:44:42] <spiderman> teh_f4ll3n: it was that way before, its just gotten noticeably worse
[20:44:56] <A-KO> and if people think something is 'weird' it's because they're not used to seeing non-white people
[20:45:13] <spiderman> A-KO: you'd be right... the whole of oregon as a whole is extremely white. Its become hispanic as you move east in farming communities
[20:45:31] <A-KO> "oh wow we got SOUL FOOD. So weird!"
[20:45:41] <spiderman> my high school of ~100 students was like 95% white
[20:46:19] <A-KO> I'd be willing to guess that Portland is one of the least diverse cities in the country, actually.
[20:46:25] <A-KO> depending on size
[20:46:45] <spiderman> lots of southern cities are less diverse
[20:46:49] <A-KO> nah not really
[20:46:50] <spiderman> birmingham
[20:46:54] <spiderman> maybe memphis
[20:47:07] <A-KO> lol nah
[20:47:11] <A-KO> they're all significantly more diverse
[20:47:20] <PublicWiFi> i can't find life cycle info on this firewall to save my life lol
[20:47:20] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> My graduating class was 165, 100% white.  Rural WI...
[20:47:42] <A-KO> Memphis is 63% AA, 26% white, non-hispanic
[20:47:48] <A-KO> fun town, too, IMO
[20:47:49] <A-KO> :D
[20:47:50] <teh_f4ll3n> WI... Wisconsin?
[20:47:50] <yuken> A-KO, no, they aren't. They have significant black populations along certain lines where plantations used to be.
[20:47:56] <spiderman> Memphis is awful
[20:48:01] <spiderman> right TurkeyGibby
[20:48:08] <yuken> You can literally just look up a map of race population density by county
[20:48:15] <yuken> and see lines in the South where it was good to grow crops.
[20:48:23] <TurkeyGibby> Memphis was wonderful
[20:48:27] <A-KO> Sure, but the major cities in the south are pretty diverse reasonably speaking
[20:48:28] <spiderman> :o
[20:48:35] <A-KO> yeah I love Memphis tbh
[20:48:36] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Yes, Wisconsin
[20:48:38] <A-KO> food is good, partying is good
[20:48:39] <yuken> Also screw the South. Too hot.
[20:48:52] <PublicWiFi> :O
[20:48:55] <PublicWiFi> you take that back
[20:48:55] <yuken> Everything else is based but it's just _TOO HOT_
[20:48:58] <A-KO> Central BBQ = mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[20:48:58] <TurkeyGibby> I mean, I agree but for other reasons 
[20:48:59] <spiderman> A-KO: southern cities are often poor and the cities tend to be black-majority, similar to the way portland is with whites
[20:49:04] <yuken> PublicWiFi, fukk u. I want my 100" of snow a year.
[20:49:16] <spiderman> not a whole lot of immigrants moving into jackson, mississippi
[20:49:17] <teh_f4ll3n> anything above 18C annual average is too hot
[20:49:24] <TurkeyGibby> and this is where I gently nudge this conversation to literally anything else :) 
[20:49:29] <A-KO> lol
[20:49:39] <PublicWiFi> you get used to the heat
[20:49:43] <spiderman> borg backup goofed up and took up all my rootfs
[20:49:47] <PublicWiFi> just go mow shirtless, you good
[20:49:51] <A-KO> I'm just saying. To Portland, literally anything outside of Pleasantville is "weird" lol.
[20:49:51] <TurkeyGibby> tbh, its the humidity that kills me, PublicWiFi 
[20:49:52] <yuken> PublicWiFi, hell no.
[20:49:52] <spiderman> caused a service outage
[20:50:00] <TurkeyGibby> I really REALLY loved Phoenix area
[20:50:00] * teh_f4ll3n loads a .50BMG cartridge and aims at Turkey
[20:50:05] <yuken> PublicWiFi, if I go shirtless, I _HAVE_ to get into shape.
[20:50:06] * TurkeyGibby gobbles
[20:50:11] <A-KO> TurkeyGibby: I enjoyed driving through it
[20:50:12] <yuken> Don't want my flab.
[20:50:12] <A-KO> lol
[20:50:19] <A-KO> I'm not sure I could do Arizona though
[20:50:21] <PublicWiFi> step 1: get swole
[20:50:22] <yuken> whereas I can hide my body under clothes up here.
[20:50:32] <PublicWiFi> step 2: move down south and enjoy sweet tea and very low cost of living
[20:50:34] <A-KO> Arizona is California's Florida
[20:50:39] <yuken> I want to get swole af but it's time consuming when you have no energy to do anything PublicWiFi :(
[20:50:42] <TurkeyGibby> A-KO: its actually a nice state to drive through, unlike fucking Kansas 
[20:50:44] <spiderman> A-KO: flagstaff is nice if you want arizona geography but seattle weather
[20:50:45] <PublicWiFi> step 3: shoot some guns at a rusted car you found in the woods
[20:50:47] <A-KO> it's where old people go to retire because it's 1/4th the cost of CA
[20:50:54] <PublicWiFi> yuken: 1 hour per day is all you need, 5x per week
[20:51:00] <PublicWiFi> really isn't 'bad once you get into the habi
[20:51:02] <PublicWiFi> habit*
[20:51:04] <TurkeyGibby> thats a lot of edging 
[20:51:10] <A-KO> TurkeyGibby: yeah this is very true. I've never driven through KS but I've gone through AR
[20:51:11] <technonerd> arizona home of the hidden Egyptian caves filled with mummies and carvings 
[20:51:13] <spiderman> I spent last summer in flagstaff in a travel trailer with no AC. It never went higher than 92F
[20:51:15] <yuken> PublicWiFi, I don't have an hour per day.
[20:51:17] <yuken> I sleep and work.
[20:51:21] <PublicWiFi> why not
[20:51:24] <PublicWiFi> you work 12's?
[20:51:27] <yuken> no.
[20:51:28] <yuken> 5-6 hours.
[20:51:31] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[20:51:35] <PublicWiFi> then you have plenty of time 
[20:51:37] <A-KO> AR and maybe West Texas are the worst drives I've ever done
[20:51:40] <TurkeyGibby> A-KO: avoid driving through Kansas and Nebraska at all costs
[20:51:42] <yuken> Nope, PublicWiFi. I work, and I sleep.
[20:51:51] <PublicWiFi> then add 30 mins per day run and youll be a fitness king
[20:51:55] <technonerd> cow and corn
[20:51:55] <yuken> oh fuck no.
[20:52:07] <yuken> I can not do cardio at all PublicWiFi. I already have the knees of an 80 year old man.
[20:52:08] <technonerd> thats all you see in ne and ks
[20:52:08] <TurkeyGibby> even driving E/W through the entirety of Texas is better
[20:52:19] <yuken> I literally can't run unless it's a serious thing.
[20:52:21] <PublicWiFi> yuken: elliptical is easy on the knees!
[20:52:24] <yuken> like "you're gonna die".

[20:52:57] <TurkeyGibby> I've been thinking of moving to CO or AZ tbh
[20:53:02] <yuken> And the rest of the time is eating and sitting.
[20:53:04] <A-KO> CO would be cool
[20:53:05] <technonerd> my neighbor has an elliptical bike that she rides outside on the bike paths
[20:53:09] <A-KO> I hear Denver is quite nice
[20:53:09] <technonerd> werid looking thing
[20:53:09] <spiderman> TurkeyGibby: I stopped to help some people on the side of the road in nebraska, they saw my Oregon plates and told me to "remember why I'm fleeing oregon, don't vote democrat" as I was leaving

[21:39:47] <int0x1C8> you'll probably need to fix the provisioning, then repair it
[21:40:29] <int0x1C8> as far as I know it's impossible to shrink a vmdk, can only expand
[21:41:06] <ptaav> int0x1C8: well first step is i need to move the vmdk files over to a stable store, then create the vm and try to attach the files
[21:41:18] <int0x1C8> the only way to shrink is to do some risky stuff with the vmdk files themselves, which are the header files for the actual storage which are in the .vmdkflat files
[21:41:57] <ptaav> yeah. the files i have have some crazy file sizes so....
[21:41:58] <int0x1C8> the vmdks are just text files with a few lines specifying the disk geometry, descriptors, GUIDs and what not, you can directly edit them
