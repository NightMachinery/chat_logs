[18:55:25] <pavonia> Ah yes
[18:57:04] <mrig> integer and float literals are cool in go as they have no limit to their precision, and can be entered into functions that expect them to e typed digits.

[19:25:29] <matiss> Sure, but the problem remains the same, to find max of unsorted array you kind of must inspect every value
[19:27:35] <hexnewbie> Also, how is that that big of a deal when  you need to inspect load/store every value to load the array into memory in the first place? If the maximum value changes, you may consider caching it and updating it on update (that may be slower, depending on how often you update/use), or if you're mmaping from slow storage you may store the maximum on the storage.
[19:28:12] <matiss> That, and also, if there is another operation that requires looping through the array, you can piggyback on that
[19:28:29] <matiss> In cases where array is "magically created" from outside sources you don't control

[22:52:43] <pyzozord> I already looked up the solution after trying to solve it for three hours
[22:52:53] <pyzozord> 1) bruteforse 2) bfs 3) dp
[22:53:18] <pyzozord> the thing is, I considered all three when I was trying to solve it myself
[22:53:48] <pyzozord> but in my mind somehow I tried to combine bfs with dp, which was overcomplicated algorithm that never worked

[22:57:08] <adder`> what's dp
[22:57:14] <pyzozord> dynamic programming
[22:57:30] <adder`> ah some leetcode lingo
[22:57:31] <pyzozord> here are the official solutions https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/solution/ I think you don't have have an account
[22:57:31] <Hitchens> Link: Loading...
[22:57:52] <pyzozord> adder`: no, it's not leetcode, dynamic programming is a mathematical algorithm
[22:58:05] <Izem> I don't really get this problem lol
[22:58:38] <poprocks> ah I thought ``dp'' might be code generation, eg, using preprocessor macros :D
[22:58:38] <pyzozord> Izem: it's just "find distance to the closes cell with zero for each cell with 1"
[22:59:01] <pyzozord> poprocks: I'm not sure if you are trolling
[22:59:24] <pyzozord> poprocks: I'll assume you do :D when in doubt assume trolling in progress :)
[22:59:30] <^-^hi> |smlckz|, netbsd, little babies, red cr* are somewhat non-evil
[22:59:30] <poprocks> pyzozord: I'm not being fully serious - but I had no idea what ``dp'' was until I looked it up
[23:00:02] <Izem> pyzozord yeah that still makes no sense
[23:00:07] <poprocks> I mean, I knew that wasn't what it *actually* was. But when I read "dynamic programming" my mind immediately jumped to "code generation"
[23:00:10] <pyzozord> poprocks: ah that explains my troll spidey sense tickeld but only a bit
[23:00:22] <Izem> this is why I sorta hate leetcode tbh
[23:00:26] <Izem> so vague
[23:00:30] *** sco1_ is now known as sco1
[23:00:48] <pyzozord> poprocks: yeah the name is stupid, apparently it was chosen by the founder just because it "sounded cool"

[23:01:12] * poprocks eye-roll-emojis
[23:02:27] <pyzozord> Izem: I'm not sure how I can explain it better, you have a 2d matrix of cells, each cell has a 0 or a 1, for each cell with a 2 you need to calculate the shortest distance to a 0

[23:15:12] <GeDaMo> |smlckz|: yeah, that's what I was thinking
[23:15:34] <GeDaMo> Also cellular automata might be an approach to consider

[23:16:11] <Izem> or concurrency :P
[23:16:12] <pyzozord> you should see it without an account
[23:16:25] *** Quits: eot (~eot@user/eot) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:17:01] <Izem> not the same, but sort of reminds me of looking for sudoku solutions
[23:17:23] <Twipply> Can't try a solution without an account?
[23:17:23] <pyzozord> my approach was kind of similar to the solution #2, but I overcomplicated it and failed. I felt like visiting the same cell multiple times is unoptimal

[23:17:59] <pyzozord> Twipply: I think you need to register to try solutions
[23:18:06] <Twipply> That's sad
[23:18:19] <pyzozord> btw this is "medium" problem, not "hard"
[23:18:29] <Izem> Twipply no I'm sure they have a valid reason :P
[23:18:52] <Twipply> Copy the 0s into a new matrix, shift them to all adjacent squares and mark as 1, shift all the 1s and mark as 2, ...
[23:19:00] <jamea77> pyzozord thanks
[23:19:03] <Twipply> only mark if said square is empty
[23:20:12] <Twipply> I wanted to try the above but can't so I just typed it here instead
[23:20:14] <pyzozord> I don't really know how to ask for help with this problem

[23:20:23] <pyzozord> My real question is "what did I do wrong"
[23:22:30] <pyzozord> I guess I should just scrap the whole code and start from scratch, maybe this time it will go better?

[23:25:04] <Izem> I decided to do real problems instead
[23:25:13] <Izem> leetcode is useless (to me)
[23:27:23] <pyzozord> I'm drinking a beer first time since about a year or miniumum half a year
[23:27:33] <pyzozord> and I have to say the experience is meh
[23:27:45] <pyzozord> I kind of feel just more bored
[23:28:12] <Izem> lol that seems risky

[23:28:47] <Izem> if you are just drinking since you are bored
[23:29:19] <pyzozord> oh yeah I guess, I'm quite sure this is a once time incident kind of thing

[23:31:55] <pyzozord> I guess I can settle for love death and robots, the first season was ok
[23:32:23] <Izem> have not heard of that, sounds like a documentary for some reason
[23:32:39] <pyzozord> i hope there is no freaky things like in black mirror, that show really scared me
[23:33:21] <Izem> lol why watch a show to scare yourself? or was it just some parts?
[23:34:59] <pyzozord> some ideas and presentation were really unsettling for me. I guess that was part of the fun for some people but I don't really like scary stuff. I mean a little is ok, but that's all. I like alien type of scary
