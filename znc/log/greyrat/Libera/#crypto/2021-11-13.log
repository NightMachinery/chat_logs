[15:07:50] <testusr> Anyone here working on something interesting related to homomorphic encryption? 
[15:08:05] <yawkat> bad, outdated crypto, bad implementation, error-prone interface, bad security model

[15:09:40] <testusr> yawkat: what do you suggest as better option? 
[15:10:10] <yawkat> minisign, signal, ... depending on use case
[15:16:31] <menace> yawkat, look at https://sequoia-pgp.org/
[15:16:46] <menace> there are modern implementations which also clean up the crypto and the interface
[15:17:06] <yawkat> you cant clean up the crypto if you need to retain compatibility
[15:17:09] <menace> the security model is not better or less then for minisign and age.. and everybody seems to like that
[15:17:42] <yawkat> no, the security model is worse than minisign, and age is a crutch
[15:17:50] <yawkat> age does not have forward secrecy either
[15:17:50] <menace> apparently, you can, then you have the same thing, like when somebody disables SSLv3 for his client... than the key negotation fails.
[15:18:16] <menace> please show a review, that for minisign the security model is better for the the signing case
[15:19:09] <yawkat> minisign has no stupid WOT and no cipher agility
[15:19:10] <yawkat> done

[15:27:51] <menace> they just can convince you with some blog post...
[15:27:59] <menace> simple question: if cipher agility is so evil, why does TLS still use it?
[15:28:10] <menace> they just initiate bike shedding discussions in communities.
[15:28:26] <yawkat> did you miss the part where they removed like 90% of the ciphers from tls 1.3?
[15:28:37] <iz> or that's just people on the internet being people on the internet
[15:28:53] <iz> not everything is a dark govt conspiracy
[15:29:25] <yawkat> schmieg has a talk here about how to do cipher agility properly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiH6iqjWpt8&t=1045s
[15:29:40] <yawkat> spoiler: it's not how gpg does it.
[15:30:13] <int-e> TLS has some bad influences... like people who think that having packet inspection for corporate firewalls is so essential that the standard needs to support it.
[15:30:31] <yawkat> didnt eTLS fail
[15:30:58] <int-e> I think it did, officially at least. But the attempt was made and that speaks volumes, doesn't it.
[15:31:31] <MacGyver> It was also shut down *hard*, which also speaks volumes. TLS 1.3 was intent on fixing mistakes of the past.
[15:31:47] <int-e> Anyway, I see cipher agility in the same context.
[15:31:56] <MacGyver> Don't just the protocol by the one corporate BITS idiot.
[15:32:00] <MacGyver> s/just/judge/
[15:32:49] <MacGyver> Though I agree that cipher agility in principle is not an advantage; and if you *must* do it, don't do it the old (i.e. wrong) way.
[15:34:18] <yawkat> i really like tinks approach. they store the cipher suite information next to the key, where it's not attacker-controlled. though that cant work for every protocol of course

[16:37:20] <iz> doesn't cipher choices just equate to a system that is only as strong as the weakest choice?
[16:38:43] <iz> being able to change the cipher used is certainly a useful trait, but i'm not sure if giving an array of choices is really useful or beneficial

[17:14:00] <menace> the problem is: big players could start precomputing stuff, when you have only ONE cipher. this is not possible at least with a few combinations. and yes, if the choice is in both acceptable ciphersuites, the weakest one could win if the negotation is faulty. but then if the negotation is faulty, it may also be faulty to a man in the middle attack
[17:14:21] <menace> and i mean it's not like we have only ONE secure cipher and ONE secure hash algorith....
[17:14:47] <menace> there's still stuff like twofish out there. but nooo, it has to be just the shiny new stuff.
[17:15:16] <int-e> precompute what exactly?
[17:20:12] <testusr> tolarz: yeah, phone bound is sad :( 
[17:21:01] <menace> rainbowtables, tables of ciphertexts which hint to more likely key material, precomputated tables which enable faster bruteforce. there may be attacks which only make sense if you have MASSIVe computing and storage power, which may be overlooked by the scientific community.
[17:22:16] <int-e> So feasibility aside... you're saying that if you actually do that once, having to do it a couple of times instead is going to stop you?

[17:22:23] <iz> re: phone numbers w/ signal, i also agree that's sad

[17:52:12] <kj7rrv> Would an xor cipher with a sufficiently long key length be secure?

[17:53:35] <riv> no
[17:54:40] <mouseghost> no
[17:54:41] <kj7rrv> Why is it insecure?
[17:54:53] <mouseghost> if you have plaintext and ciphertext, you can get the key
[17:54:56] <riv> a MITM attacker can modify the ciphertext without detection
[17:55:01] <mouseghost> or that
[17:55:06] <kj7rrv> Oh, okay.
[17:55:28] <riv> to fix this you need to encrypt then MAC (add a message authentication code)
[17:55:34] <snappy> if the key is as long as the message then you would get the one time pad
[17:56:03] <kj7rrv> Yes, I understand how one-time pads work. Are they secure against MitM attacks?
[17:56:40] <snappy> then no, as riv said, mitm can modify ciphertext
[17:57:15] <kj7rrv> Okay. So the information theoretical security only protects against someone reading the message, not modifying it?
[17:57:32] <snappy> correct, it protects confidentiality, not integrity
[17:58:01] <ms7821> that's a bit unfair on information-theoretic security
[17:58:02] <kj7rrv> Okay, thank you.
[17:58:25] <ms7821> the problem is that OTP is an incomplete ciphersystem
[17:58:42] <riv> suppose you are sending either the message: "YES" or "NO!" and attacker can xor the ciphertext with "YES" xor "NO!" to to swap whatever the plaintext is
[17:59:17] <riv> if you have a MAC, modifications like that would be detected, and an attacker is not able to forge their own replacement MAC without knowing the key

[18:00:58] <kj7rrv> It seems like an attacker could change the message and the hash, but they couldn't make them match
[18:01:33] <ms7821> a keyed hash can be used as a mac
[18:01:45] <ms7821> but if the messages are YES or NO!, the attacker can generate the hash for both

[18:46:13] <snappy> i've always wondered, simply extending OTP to encrypt a hash would suffice no?
[18:46:32] <snappy> doesn't need to be a keyed hash or MAC
[18:48:20] <riv> snappy: you are suggesting to mac then encrypt, rather than encrypt then mac?
[18:48:44] <riv> (except the mac is a hash)
[18:48:47] <snappy> yes
[18:49:41] <riv> I dont remember the details but I think it became clear over time that mac then encrypt kept leading to problems
[18:49:42] <ms7821> and how do you validate the hash as being created by someone with the key?
[18:49:58] <riv> if you search about it you can find information about it
[18:50:18] <riv> but cryptography has basically come to agreement that encrypt then mac is a better approach
[18:50:27] <ms7821> yeah, google for cryptographic doom principle
[18:50:47] <snappy> ms7821: well if the ciphertext is tampered, either the plaintext or the hash will be damaged
[18:50:55] <snappy> i think the properties change for OTP
[18:51:00] <ms7821> what if I tampered it in a way that takes the hash into account?
[18:51:27] <ms7821> (again, imagine the possible messages are YES or NO! and as an attacker I know this)
[18:51:28] <snappy> can you elaborate
[18:52:14] *** Quits: fulldecent (~textual@wikipedia/fulldecent) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[18:52:14] <snappy> sure so you know the hash values, but with an OTP ciphertext all you can do is modify the ciphertext without knowledge of the keystream
[18:52:18] <ms7821> I can xor the message with "YES" || hash("YES") ^ "NO!" || hash("NO!") and it'll swap the result
[18:52:59] <snappy> ms7821: i don't see how that's possible with OTP
[18:53:19] <MacGyver> It is, though.
[18:53:27] <ms7821> as an attacker, I can modify the whole message, not just the non-hash part
[18:53:37] <ms7821> and I can predict the hash if it's not keyed
[18:53:39] <MacGyver> The point ms7821 is making is that if you use an *unkeyed* hash, anyone can compute the hash.
[18:54:00] <MacGyver> So it's no different than modifying a bank account number in OTP, or a word, or anything at all.
[18:54:08] <MacGyver> Because you can compute the source and the target.
[18:54:19] <MacGyver> So you can compute the XOR of the source and the target.
[18:54:27] <snappy> how would you modify the ciphertext to have the hash you target?
[18:54:41] <MacGyver> Exactly how you modify the ciphertext to have the message you target.
[18:54:44] <snappy> you need to know the keystream
[18:54:46] <MacGyver> You XOR the difference.
[18:54:50] <MacGyver> No you don't.
[18:54:56] <MacGyver> That's *the* problem with the OTP construction.
[18:55:30] <ms7821> (apart from key distribution)
[18:55:42] <MacGyver> Well sure.
[18:55:56] <snappy> i honestly don't see how this xor attack works
[18:56:08] <MacGyver> I don't have time to work through the math with you.
[18:56:11] <snappy> i think the best you can do is break the integrity
[18:56:14] <MacGyver> Someone else can take that up.
[18:56:16] <MacGyver> You're wrong.
[18:56:22] <MacGyver> Just try it.
[18:56:39] <MacGyver> XOR the difference of the original message and your target message with the ciphertext.
[18:56:41] <MacGyver> Then decrypt.
[18:56:57] <MacGyver> "Difference" is also computed with XOR.
[18:57:16] <snappy> so...
[18:57:46] <snappy> C1 = K1 xor P1 -- C2 = K2 xor P2 -- C1 xor C2 = K1 xor K2 xor P1 xor P2
[18:57:49] <snappy> er
[18:57:51] <snappy> C3
[18:58:40] <snappy> K1 xor K2 xor "Y"|H("Y") xor "N"|H("N")
[18:59:04] <ms7821> K2?
[18:59:05] <MacGyver> More like C = K xor M; D = M xor M'; C xor D = K xor M xor M xor M' = K xor M'.
[18:59:18] <MacGyver> M' is your target message. M is the original.
[18:59:27] <MacGyver> xor K out again (i.e. decrypt) and you're left with M'.
[18:59:47] <snappy> ms7821: you don't reuse keys in OTP
[18:59:58] <ms7821> or in the example given above, C1 = "YES" ^ key, C2 = "NO!" ^ key, D = "YES" ^ "NO", C1 ^ D = C2
[19:00:16] <ms7821> snappy, yeah but you still need to get them to people
[19:00:17] <snappy> yeah that's not OTP though, fresh keys every time
[19:00:23] <MacGyver> snappy: What.
[19:00:31] <MacGyver> No I *really* don't have time for this.
[19:00:34] <ms7821> heh
[19:00:38] <MacGyver> snappy: K is just the *entire* keystream.
[19:00:48] <MacGyver> Just... work it through.
[19:00:49] <Alipha> EncryptedNoHash = EncryptedYesHash ^ H("Y") ^ H("N")
[19:00:50] <MacGyver> Try it yourself.
[19:00:56] <snappy> if you're seriously doing one time pad, you don't reuse keystream
[19:00:58] <snappy> that simple.
[19:01:01] <ms7821> wat
[19:01:08] <MacGyver> My example DID NOT reuse the keystream.
[19:01:13] <MacGyver> The attacker doesn't NEED the keystream.
[19:01:22] <MacGyver> The decryptor does, because that's how they decrypt.
[19:01:35] <MacGyver> XOR once with keystream to encrypt. XOR again to decrypt.
[19:01:41] <ms7821> the point is that the attacker can modify the ciphertext without knowing the key

[20:46:20] <yawkat> menace: there are reasonably good arguments for cipher agility but "precompute stuff" isnt one
[20:46:55] <yawkat> if it is possible to "precompute stuff" to attack your cipher suite, you should switch off it altogether
[20:47:25] <yawkat> having more ciphers doesnt help at all, especially since even in protocols with cipher agility, 99% of users will use the same or same few suites

[21:12:40] <Alipha> I mean, cipher agility allowed people to quickly change their browsers/servers to prefer RC4 over AES while the BEAST attack was a concern, until a long term fix could be implemented
[21:13:26] <yawkat> yes, this is pretty much the only good reason for cipher agility, and also why people used to like it
[21:14:47] <yawkat> but nowadays our understanding of ciphers is much more evolved and we dont use broken constructions anymore
[21:14:59] <ms7821> yes, we have perfect ciphers now so we'll never need to use it again
[21:15:36] <yawkat> probably not, but thats what tink-like cipher agility is for :)
[21:15:46] <Peng> Alipha: Installing software updates would also have allowed people to work around BEAST without using a cipher that was arguably worse, though
[21:16:22] <danieldg> weren't updates needed on both sides?
[21:16:36] <danieldg> versus cipher agility lets one side "fix" the problem
[21:17:29] <Peng> Probably, I don't remember, but if everybody in the world install4ed software updates immediately that would have been fine ;D
[21:18:04] <danieldg> do people in this fantasy world also stop using software that is out of support?
[21:18:33] *** Joins: defiant (~defiant@user/defiant)

[21:24:00] <Peng> In a hypothetical perfect world, people could've installed software updates with a mitigation as quickly as they could have edited their config to disable RC4.
[21:24:17] <menace> yawkat, well, perhaps there are precomputation attacks, we are not aware off. hard to switch them off then, no? 
[21:24:59] <menace> and your sentences are going more now in the direction of opinion. i gave my reasoning. if you do not agree, fine.
[21:25:24] <yawkat> if there are, cipher agility is a shit defense against it
[21:25:43] <iz> there's this tradeoff between computation time and storage space that precomputation attacks try to take advantage of by shifting from one to the other
[21:26:46] <menace> but you do understand the problem, do you? and there's nothing else as defense, because there are no provable secure symmetric ciphers and hash algorithms, as far as i know.
[21:26:52] <iz> that doesn't mean precomputation attacks can just break anything, because practical terms you only have so much storage space and time
[21:27:02] <menace> you can build another defense type be my guest
[21:27:02] <Peng> I'm mostly just being contrary. Some people thnik cipher agility isn't worth it. I see their point but don't really agree.
[21:27:26] <yawkat> menace: no, i dont understand the problem, there is no feasible way a precomputation attack is mitigated by cipher agility, be it a known or unknown attack
[21:28:12] <yawkat> even the factor 5 you mentioned, which is wildly optimistic, is not something that would matter for a realistic precomputation attack
[21:28:48] <menace> well, ...  you just cannot know, if there are mathematical shortcuts which would enable this for certain ciphers or ciphertypes or hashing-strategies
[21:29:00] <menace> that's a bit arrogant on your side, IMO.
[21:29:15] <menace> but that's only, like, my opinion.
[21:29:40] <yawkat> for your scenario to work, the attack would have to be just at the edge of computational feasibility, so that a small factor on top of it would matter. which is extremely unlikely.
[21:29:55] <yawkat> as i said, i understand some arguments for agility, but this is a really bad one
[21:30:25] <iz> i suspect they are trying to make two seperate points and they got muddled some how?

[21:30:36] <menace> well, you said what you want to say. i do not agree with it. let's leave it like that, because i have the feeling you just dismiss my point.
[21:31:12] <danieldg> menace: the way to solve this is to define the benefit you are denying the adversary, mathematically
[21:31:18] <ms7821> it also suggests that these people who can use precomputation can't just do it for eah of the most popular ciphers
[21:31:31] <ms7821> doesn't make any sense I'm afraid
[21:32:32] <menace> ms7821, not only the ciphers, but also for example assymmetric parameters and hash-types. the combinatorial explosion of ciphersuites would not be feasible from my point of view.

[21:32:44] <iz> oh jeez
[21:32:47] <ms7821> it's not like you can go "today I'm using double-rot13-7DES-AES-GCM" and the NSA goes "dammit, we had single rot13"
[21:33:31] <yawkat> im pretty sure i understood the argument correctly, it just *is* that bad.
[21:33:38] <iz> menace: so for waht it's worth, i also disagree with your point about cipher agility helping against precomputation attacks somehow
[21:34:21] <menace> iz: that's totally okay. but i do not see any convincing argument here, why  it would not work from my POV.
[21:34:45] <iz> well, the whole channel is has been trying to explain it to you for like the past 20 mins
[21:35:00] <ms7821> you believe there are modern TLS ciphers that are susceptible to rainbow table attacks?
[21:35:02] * iz shrugs
[21:35:07] <danieldg> menace: I think there's a communication issue: we aren't saying it woudn't work, we are saying it would not be worth it.  You at most multiply your adversary cost by say 8.

[21:40:43] <riv> which cipher?
[21:40:47] <iz> precomputation attacks can just be made unfeasiable
[21:41:17] <iz> that's why you never see rainbow tables for strong hashes with sufficiently large salts -- mostly just md5sum ones

[21:42:23] <iz> it works great on the few places it can work.. but most of the time it's unfeasible and you can ensure that if you plan ahead a little
[21:43:32] <menace> again: this only counts for mathematical methods you know of. riv: the one which is then used in age. or if there's only one cipher in the tls ciphersuites, that one.

[21:44:55] <iz> a precomputation attack is the method
[21:45:10] <iz> there isn't a secret way to do a precomputation attack -- how to do it is right in the name
[21:45:41] <ms7821> again, if a precomputation attack existed, the NSA would just do it anyway, and be happy at being able to access 50% or whatever of streams
[21:45:56] <riv> ChaCha20-Poly1305
[21:46:38] <ms7821> agility doesn't mean a new cipher every day, it means a migration path without a version bump
[21:47:13] <ms7821> and the obvious question there is why would you want a migration path that's not one-way
[21:47:49] <ms7821> (age's solution iirc is to use a version bump)
[21:48:51] <menace> iz, but what you DO precompute for less time, that's where the math would be. and that is hard to predict, because there's no way knowing (without having the attack) if there's such an atack.

[21:51:29] <danieldg> also, any precomputation attack can be trivially turned into a postcomputation attack, so this really just assumes the existance of an attack period.
