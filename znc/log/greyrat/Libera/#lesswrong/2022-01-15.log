[00:15:49] <pompolic> ah
[00:16:37] <pompolic> the paths i can see immediately are: developing multiple styles, and having an algorithm for switching between them. this becomes a meta-style, kicking the problem up a level of abstraction (and the abstractions are leaky too anyway)
[00:17:25] <pompolic> and the other one is putting some transform in front of outputs, for example with regards to text, having an NN do the actual phrasing
[00:17:32] <pompolic> this seems it would just trigger an arms race

[00:18:36] <pompolic> i suppose you can trade off some performance/optimization power for noising your outputs
[00:18:55] <pompolic> just monte carlo the original problem you're optimizing

[01:23:36] <catern> by this I mean super-conventional baking sugar
[01:25:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think there are any easier ways
[01:25:09] <PlanckWalk> Easiest to produce it from what?
[01:25:19] <PlanckWalk> Carbon dioxide and water?
[01:26:01] <catern> well, mainly easiest to produce in that there's a small number of steps that I can easily describe
[01:26:10] <catern> I guess I'll just go with honey from beehives
[01:26:19] <catern> which can be eaten pretty raw, right? well I guess you need to filter it?
[01:26:29] <PlanckWalk> You can eat it raw
[01:26:37] <gwern> 'take honey from a beehive' is a pretty simple sugar process
[01:26:54] <PlanckWalk> If you don't mind that it probably has bits of other stuff in it
[01:27:00] <catern> yes, indeed that's the simplest I can think of
[01:27:04] <gwern> the other stuff is tasty and good for you anyway
[01:27:41] <PlanckWalk> But yeah, the end process for the human is easy there
[01:27:52] <PlanckWalk> The actual production process is insanely complex, but that's hidden
[01:28:04] <catern> good good
[01:29:59] * PlanckWalk now wonders about the minimum area required to support producing a kilogram per day of honey.
[01:30:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Outsourcing production complexities to innocent animals is definitely the lazy way to do things
[01:34:11] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, looks like it's complicated since a lot of commercial producers migrate their colonies through the year.
[01:34:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah but you don't *have to* do that
[01:35:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Think about those people who discovered bees in their house walls
[01:35:03] <PlanckWalk> I was just hoping to be able to say "here's a commercial honey producers and it uses this much land" though.
[01:35:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> They didn't even know they were producing honey!
[01:35:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's how little effort it takes!
[01:35:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> One day suddenly there's bees
[01:35:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> You crack open the very walls of your house and bam: like hundreds of pounds of delicious honey
[01:35:57] <gwern>  YOU: ME: EVERYONE: BEES: [Honey!]
[01:35:59] <PlanckWalk> But but ... how much honey did they produce, and how far did the bees range, and did they outcompete other colonies in the range and and
[01:36:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> That
[01:36:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the bees' concerns
[01:36:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the whole point of outsourcing!
[01:36:59] <gwern> they're trade secrets. you're not allowed to know
[01:37:06] <catern> this is a good commentary on the value of object encapsulation and abstraction
[01:37:21] <catern> since I'll have a Bees object with a .harvest() method or something
[01:38:22] <catern> which will take flowers and produce honey
[01:39:43] <PlanckWalk> All I've found is "millions of acres" for "38 million pounds" of honey per year.
[01:39:53] <PlanckWalk> How many millions of acres? :-(
[01:40:48] <PlanckWalk> (From North Dakota)
[01:41:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: You could say that plants require a procedural approach while bees provide an object-oriented approach; this makes sense because, as animals, they are independent and can take actions on their own, like objects
[01:41:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: The other advantage, of course, is...
[01:41:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: ... syntactic sugar
[01:41:30] * Obormot\Arcturus shades
[01:41:34] <catern> nice

[01:42:13] <ardent[m]> nice pun
[01:42:39] <ardent[m]> 🍅
[01:43:01] <catern> maybe "I can't find my syntactic sugar, so I'm making do with honey"
[01:43:15] <ardent[m]> on your end does that show up as : tomato : or as 🍅?

[01:45:17] <PlanckWalk> Aha, this is more quantifiable: 800k acres of almonds are pollinated by ~1M bee colonies, and the average bee colony in the US produces ~50-60 pounds of honey per year.
[01:45:24] <ardent[m]> (don't worry that wasn't actually a password of mine)
[01:46:29] <PlanckWalk> So maybe 60-ish pounds per acre-year for honey based on almond trees.
[01:47:10] <PlanckWalk> (But maybe they move those colonies elsewhere during the year to get nectar from other sources too)
[01:47:44] <PlanckWalk> At least it's likely to be within an order of magnitude.

[03:53:41] <kiboneu> killing latent pathogens would be great
[03:53:54] <kiboneu> ebv, toxoplasmosis
[03:54:58] <phill> Yeah, but you can't advocate for that publicity
[03:55:02] <phill> Publicly*
[03:55:07] <phill> Bc of resistance
[03:56:24] <gwern> I doubt we have any antivirals which are sufficiently broad-spectrum and sufficiently low side-effect to be worthwhile, also, for most of these things the virus doesn't need to present
[03:56:48] <gwern> toxo for example is just latent inside its cysts doing little or nothing after initial infection afaik
[03:57:11] <gwern> I don't even know if there are any reasonable antivirals which can kill toxo inside the cysts
[03:57:37] <kiboneu> right toxo is not going to be affected by an antiviral, i meant pathogens in general and their overall health / cost burden
[03:58:42] <kiboneu> i also am not convinced thaqt toxo in theiur cyst stages are guaranteed not to pass into the brain even in a healthy nimmune system
[03:59:17] <phill> You don't even need to completely get rid of it either though.. just every often enough to keep it at bay
[03:59:41] <Ralith> good way to promote resistance
[04:00:04] <phill> Yes, this is a bad public health decision

[16:07:23] <kuudes> re https://twitter.com/finnitejest/status/1481894297083736064 it seems to me that the alternate option just is impossible
[16:07:24] <Robomot> F!nn (@finnitejest): "Low state capacity tied with high tolerance for state coercion leads to really undesirable outcomes like an inability to increase hospital bed capacity but an ability to force everyone to work from home for the greater part of two years to preserve existing hospitals capacity"
[16:08:03] <kuudes> I mean, for the hospitals to be able to deal with covid surge without vaccines, something like 1/10 to 2/3 of population would need to be icu nurses
[16:08:10] <kuudes> so I guess it is not physically impossible
[16:08:46] <kuudes> we just transform the whole society to be only a large hospital system
[16:09:04] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, it would only take about 20 years
[16:09:48] <PlanckWalk> Mostly in the training required by that much larger fraction of the population.
[16:10:19] <kuudes> I mean, one thing I have proposed is that now that here in Finland we seem to be moving to unisex draft; which has been criticized that the military does not want that many rookies
[16:10:29] <PlanckWalk> And the fact that, you know, nowhere near that many people *want* to be ICU nurses and what are you going to do, coerce them?
[16:10:55] <kuudes> is that maybe we should reform the civilian service option to be similar training for being some sort of pandemic icu nurse trainee
[16:11:23] <kuudes> so that in these sort of pandemics we could actually "declare war on the virus" and draft some 30% of population to work as icu nurse aids
[16:11:30] <kuudes> as we do in case of war
[16:11:51] <PlanckWalk> Well yes, but it seemed that the "finnitejest" poster was arguing that the problem is largely "high tolerance for state coercion"
[16:12:08] <kuudes> yes, I think they advocate the "let people die" approach actually
[16:12:15] <PlanckWalk> And mandatory ICU training is definitely state coercion.
[16:12:19] <kuudes> and complain when other people don't want to die
[16:12:24] <PlanckWalk> So I don't know what they really propose.
[16:12:38] <kuudes> well the poor people just don't have money to live, they should be mooned
[16:12:45] <kuudes> harsh mistress etc
[16:13:18] <PlanckWalk> ... and they would defend that as *not* "undesirable outcomes like an inability to increase hospital bed 
[16:13:32] <PlanckWalk> Oops, overpaste
[16:13:41] <PlanckWalk> ... and they would defend that as *not* "undesirable outcomes"
[16:14:03] <kuudes> they are indeed solving a different problem than the rest of the discussants
[16:14:19] <kuudes> ie they are solving "others are coercing ME" when others are solving "people are dying"
[16:14:41] <PlanckWalk> Ah, I see: "This is where I’m actually, against all my vibes, not a neoliberal at all but a believer in an ironfisted state"
[16:15:08] <PlanckWalk> So yeah: looks like mandatory ICU training.
[16:15:25] <PlanckWalk> Or whatever else might be required 20 years before an unexpected emergency.
[16:16:49] <PlanckWalk> (But seriously, my area had ~2 years of zero covid with no lockdowns just via half-decent border control)
[16:16:56] <kuudes> yes
[16:16:59] <kuudes> same here
[16:17:40] <kuudes> well, we have <100/100k-14d
[16:17:53] <kuudes> where >50/100k-14d was deemed extra high
[16:18:04] <PlanckWalk> Businesses that relied on mass tourism and cheap foreign workers screamed, and they opened up fully.  Then when everyone got COVID and tourism crashed and nobody wanted to come here to work anymore, they screamed even louder.
[16:18:24] <kuudes> tourism is cancer
[16:18:54] <kuudes> it seems to me that providing tourism sales is basically about always just selling commons
[16:18:57] <PlanckWalk> and on top of that, all the local businesses screamed blue murder when all their employees got sick
[16:19:14] <PlanckWalk> So yeah, not sure that was the greatest decision :(
[16:19:43] <PlanckWalk> For 18 months we had <1 case per 100k per 14 days.
[16:20:17] <kuudes> border > festivals > bars > construction > factories > schools > hospitals > cemetaries, pick a point and all left of it to fail
[16:21:25] <kuudes> my basic thesis against tourism is that people rarely seem to visit places richer than their own comparison locale
[16:22:04] <kuudes> so that implies tourism is mainly working on the cost gradient
[16:22:30] <kuudes> people come from high cost/salary locales to low cost/salary locales to use services that are reserved for high salary people there
[16:23:07] <kuudes> so they are alike to selling sex, drugs, organs, slaves etc in extreme
[16:23:45] <PlanckWalk> Ah well, enough rant from me about the state of the world, and time to dream about a weirder one.
[16:23:52] <kuudes> and seem dependent on there being border which only allows rich people to visit poor locale and not the other way around

[17:17:33] <capisce> kuudes: it's quite popular for south east asians to visit singapore, which is indeed richer than their own place
[17:17:52] <kuudes> but is it richer than the visitor's local locale
[17:17:53] <capisce> similarly paris, new york, london, switzerland etc are also quite popular tourist locations
[17:18:05] <capisce> what do you mean by local locale?
[17:18:14] <kuudes> ie if they are rich in poor place, is singapore richer than the rich-in-poor-state
[17:18:31] <capisce> often they're not that rich themselves
[17:18:34] <kuudes> ie their family etc
[17:18:42] <capisce> but you can still afford a trip for a few days

[17:19:19] <kuudes> isn't taiwan pretty rich?
[17:20:16] <capisce> I guess they're not that far behind Japan in gdp per capita
[17:21:41] <capisce> when Chinese people visit Europe they also save up to visit Paris, London, North Europe, Switzerland etc, instead of East Europe, Albania etc
[17:21:59] <capisce> of course when North Europeans travel it's likely they will go somewhere with a lower gdp per capita
[17:22:09] <kuudes> yes, but the chinese tourists are not average chinese
[17:22:28] <kuudes> aren't they usually richer persons than the average of their target locations?

[17:24:23] <kuudes> unsure
[17:28:38] <capisce> in a world were average gdp per capita and income distribution was the same in each country, you don't think people would travel any more?

[17:38:19] <capisce> I strongly doubt that most of tourism would cease, likely there'd be even more of it if people from poorer countries could afford to travel more as well

[17:39:10] <vrs> why wouldn't I do a tourism to countries that cost the same as back home

[17:39:49] <vrs> iceland is pretty expensive and still a great destination
[17:40:04] <capisce> now people preferably go to places which offer a higher quality to cost ratio, which seems quite natural
[17:40:10] <kuudes> how much is your salary compared to iceland, vrs?
[17:40:12] <capisce> although people still have a lot of different preferences about travel
[17:40:42] <vrs> kuudes: in terms of food prices, iceland is about as bad as the city I live in, which is one of the more expensive ones in my country
[17:41:01] <kuudes> iceland is about 55k$/capita/y
[17:41:09] <vrs> and food+transportation prices will be the main item I care about
[17:41:14] <kuudes> do you earn less or equal to 55k$/y?
[17:41:28] <vrs> less but that's because I'm a part time slacker
[17:41:36] <kuudes> hmm, ok
[17:43:58] <capisce> I have a Chinese friend from Changzhou who travelled (not as part of a package tour) to North Europe in 2019

[18:52:27] <kuudes> yes, but sex tourism is not a male only thing; gambia is a popular destination for women iirc
[18:54:45] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't get sex tourism: are people too poor to buy sex in their own state?

[19:02:17] <capisce> "Estimates from ECPAT International show that each year, approximately 250,000 people travel internationally to engage in sex tourism with children and youth and that the industry generates over $20 billion in revenue."
[19:02:31] <capisce> hmm, that was only for underage sex tourism
[19:03:44] <capisce> but at least the underage sex tourism accounts for only 0.017 % of all international tourism
[19:05:40] <PapuaHardyNet> 20$ billion is huge. to compare, netflix annual revenue for 2020 was $24.9 billion
[19:06:26] <capisce> 20 billion divided by 250000 = $80000 per person
[19:06:29] <kuudes> germany has more legal brothel system; sex trade between russia and finland seems pretty long phenomenon
[19:07:11] <capisce> that seems a bit high, unless the revenue also accounts for domestic abuse
[19:07:41] <capisce> finland and germany have more or less the same gdp per capita though
[19:07:41] <kuudes> or there are more persons that are unaccounted for
[19:10:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Yes it does, that's how it parses gwernpastes ...
[19:12:57] <kuudes> sex work in itself is not bad, but that it usually involves harming of people is
[19:13:26] <PapuaHardyNet> that's obvious, yes
[19:13:57] <PapuaHardyNet> (well, it surely is obvious in our social group)
[19:14:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> "usually"? THat seems like a non-obvious claim
[19:17:15] <capisce> and again I doubt sex tourism is a significant portion of all tourism
[19:19:05] <PapuaHardyNet> my reasoning went something like this: people consider sex sacred -> value of selling sex is very high -> people will only sell it if they are under coercion, direct or indirect, or the opportunity cost is very low
[19:19:26] <gwern> you have only to look at the swarms of chinese tourists on the streets of NYC or something. if sex tourism were a large fraction, you'd need a hell of a lot of fleshpots
[19:20:35] <capisce> in Nordic countries around 13 % of men have paid for sex
[19:20:47] <capisce> https://prostitution.procon.org/percentage-of-men-by-country-who-paid-for-sex-at-least-once-the-johns-chart/
[19:20:48] <Robomot> Percentage of Men (by Country) Who Paid for Sex at Least Once: The Johns Chart - Prostitution - ProCon.org (We drew the information presented below about the male clients (johns) of prostitutes worldwide from 21 studies conducted between 1994 and 2010. We included the only 15 countries for which we found data on men paying for sex at least once in their lifetimes. We excluded countries for which we could only …)
[19:21:03] <capisce> but I guess quite a bit of that is in one's own country
[19:21:23] <gwern> which is a lifetime rate, while approximately 100% have done a tourism that year

[19:21:59] <capisce> in Cambodia the rate of men who have paid for sex is 60 to 80 %...
[19:22:06] <PapuaHardyNet> there's no shame in paying for sex - we all pay for it one way or another
[19:22:24] <feep> we need a new sequences post
[19:22:37] <feep> "guys, you suck at reasoning, just stop entirely."
[19:23:09] <capisce> "In Thai society, boys begin to buy women when they are around 13 years old; 50 per cent of 16-year-old boys and 90 per cent of university students go to brothels."
[19:23:13] *** Joins: emyrs (~emyrs@user/emyrs)
[19:23:24] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao, okay that really does put it into perspective
[19:23:38] <gwern> capisce: a rare case of successfully development of an indigenous services industry for export!
[19:24:14] <capisce> why is it only the western men who travel there to buy sex who get the hate?
[19:24:34] <feep> ingroup, outgroup, fargroup
[19:24:41] <PapuaHardyNet> because they are judged according to the standards and context of their society?
[19:25:13] <capisce> right, but they're usually painting it as harming the women there
[19:25:21] <gwern> there's also reference effect and context. what sort of loser or pedophile do you have to be to travel to cambodia/thailand for sex? meanwhile if 90% of successful university students locally are doing it, maybe the ones who *don't* are the losers
[19:25:59] <feep> and also, who cares about blaming anyone half a world away?
[19:26:11] <feep> that's no fun
[19:26:40] <capisce> unless it's the Chinese government
[19:26:44] <PapuaHardyNet> never blame women
[19:26:47] <feep> they're not blaming either
[19:27:01] <feep> well, I mean, yes but in a different sense
[19:27:27] * feep thinks
[19:27:52] <feep> actually, the chinese government is a great example of a situation where it *does* make sense to blame someone half a world away
[19:28:13] <feep> because they're in an ideological war and on a global scale, distances shrink down
[19:28:32] *** Quits: gproto_23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:28:35] <feep> but like, nobody at your uni is gonna start a petition to get "men in cambodia" kicked out for taking advantage of sex work
[19:28:42] <feep> because. like. they're in cambodia.
[19:29:43] <capisce> there were some communist solidarity marches for the people in china and vietnam etc in the 70s
[19:29:50] <feep> what does that get you, nothing, nobody will even defend them except nerds who you're not scared of anyway, and hey, you might be making yourself vulnerable
[19:30:18] <feep> capisce: the cynical reply is it doesn't actually matter what it says on the posters
[19:30:40] <capisce> I guess they were mainly signalling, plus more anti-US than pro-Vietnam
[19:30:49] <feep> yeah, and the us is right there
[19:31:14] <feep> betcha none of them actually went to vietnam lol
[19:31:35] <feep> hm. thinking about isis now, it's actually fascinating how many stories there were of people going to join them
[19:31:58] <feep> I wonder if you can measure hotness of cw by counting people moving for ideological reasons
[19:32:16] <kuudes> cw?
[19:32:19] <feep> culture war
[19:32:26] <kuudes> oh
[19:32:33] <feep> the largescale manifestation of smallscale status games
[19:32:48] <capisce> most of the cw is mainly online though
[19:32:50] <feep> usually teens vs parents in various guises
[19:32:56] <PapuaHardyNet> what culture war underlied west vs isis?
[19:33:11] <feep> idk, I wasn't in those communities
[19:33:11] <capisce> islam vs secular western values?
[19:33:16] <feep> probably
[19:33:44] <capisce> a culture war felt strongly by quite a people living in western societies
[19:33:46] <feep> righteousness vs degeneracy from the other side presumably, that's usually what it is
[19:33:51] <capisce> quite a few*
[19:34:19] <capisce> so no surprise many traveled to join isis, also from Norway and Sweden etc
[19:34:25] <capisce> young men and women
[19:35:03] <capisce> probably radicalized mainly over the internet
[19:35:19] <PapuaHardyNet> i found it strange that nords joined isis
[19:35:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hey who here knows stuff about
[19:35:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> emojis
[19:35:51] <feep> nonzero but not much
[19:36:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> When people do like :winkyface: and then that gets somehow convered to a winkyface emoji, what is that

[19:54:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do I find text in files on a unix
[19:54:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like "search for string 'foo' in all the files under path 'bar'"
[19:54:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> How to do?
[19:54:57] <gwern> 'grep -R foo bar/' comes to mind
[19:55:54] <feep> yeah
[19:56:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> thx
[19:56:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> God this is slow
[19:57:51] <gwern> it's single-threaded and simple. there are tools like ggreer's ag which are way faster and more sophisticated but you'd have to install and learn them and you just wanted the simplest easiest way
[19:58:01] <feep> also it actually searches the file, it's not indexed
[19:58:18] <gwern> or you'd have to parallelize by hand with xargs/parallel which is further work
[19:58:27] <PapuaHardyNet> Obormot/Arcturus: replace -R with --recursive and it should work
[19:58:33] <feep> wat?
[19:58:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> wat
[19:58:52] <PapuaHardyNet> do it, I was testing this command all this time because I couldn't believe gwern
[19:59:02] <feep> wat
[19:59:07] <feep> -r doesn't follow symlinks
[19:59:23] <feep> usually you want following symlinks
[20:00:13] <gwern> indeed. if obormot had wanted something as unusual and extremely specific as 'but it can't follow symlinks' he'd've said so
[20:00:24] <PapuaHardyNet> darn, you are right, the reason it is so slow for me is that I have sockets in my directory
[20:01:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh, right... well, no, I have no symlinks that need to be followed or not followed here, so w/e
[20:01:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Currently racing grep against twfind
[20:01:49] <PapuaHardyNet> also try ripgrep, probably one of the fastest
[20:01:54] <feep> note that grep is gonna be a lot faster after the first time
[20:01:58] <feep> cause of caching
[20:02:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't have any ripgrep
[20:02:04] <feep> so racing might not get you accurate info
[20:02:14] <PapuaHardyNet> grep does caching? impressive
[20:02:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's the first time
[20:02:20] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: the os does
[20:02:39] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: I mean, if you start a second search on the same pc, it's gonna profit from grep warming up the fs cache
[20:02:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> ?
[20:03:02] <feep> I should probably ask what twfind is
[20:03:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> I will quote the twfind man page:
[20:03:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> OMG PNOIES
[20:03:33] <feep> okay XD
[20:04:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> (twfind is what bbfind was called when it came bundled with TextWrangler instead of BBEdit)
[20:04:42] <feep> this tells me nothing :D
[20:05:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> (TextWrangler is what BBEdit Lite was called after they renamed BBEdit Lite to TextWrangler and before they renamed TextWrangler to "BBEdit but you didn't pay the shareware fee")
[20:05:08] <feep> it does not get betteeer
[20:05:23] <feep> is it a builtin editor search?
[20:05:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a commandline tool that provides a CLI to a builtin editor search
[20:05:49] <feep> odd :o
[20:06:00] <feep> well, do keep in mind when racing that it'll profit from grep heating up the fs cache
[20:06:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well whatever
[20:06:32] <feep> (there's proper ways to benchmark fs tools, it involves resetting the cache inbetween runs)
[20:06:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's ok, it wasn't a serious benchmark
[20:06:51] <PapuaHardyNet> what are you looking for, anyway
[20:06:52] <feep> just noting~

[20:07:52] <Robomot> GitHub - phiresky/ripgrep-all: rga: ripgrep, but also search in PDFs, E-Books, Office documents, zip, tar.gz, etc.
[20:08:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: On any machine where I have privileges to install new software, this is a moot point because I have mdfind and mdfind is way, way faster than any other thing
[20:08:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nothing will be faster than mdfind
[20:09:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if I don't have install privileges then "install a fancy non-standard search tool" is moot, obviously
[20:09:05] <PapuaHardyNet> why is mdfind faster than anything at all?
[20:09:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because it uses the Spotlight index

Spotlight is a selection-based search system, which creates an index of all items and files on the system. It is designed to allow the user to quickly locate a wide variety of items on the computer, including documents, pictures, music, applications, and System Preferences. In …)
[20:10:22] <PapuaHardyNet> spotlight indexes files and has a key-document map made? let me read that wp link

[20:12:37] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't know exactly how spotlight indexes documents, but I'll assume that for documents it has a key-document map
[20:12:55] <PapuaHardyNet> and no the wp link didn't clarify this
[20:13:16] <PapuaHardyNet> it did say that documents are indexed though.
[20:13:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> They certainly are
[20:14:22] <PapuaHardyNet> "Maybe it's time to admit that "I want to be a blogger" is just the millennial version of "I want to be a streamer". I want to be famous and respected and loved. But the revealed preference is that I actually like being anonymous and having a regular office job."

[20:15:57] <PapuaHardyNet> wow. that's pretty good.
[20:16:40] <PapuaHardyNet> I guess an incrementally updated index is used. the moment a file is changed, the index is updated to account for the new file

[21:32:51] <gwern> why are ._ files so hard to exclude?
[21:33:17] <gwern> is it some sort of apple behavior that 'tar cf foo.tar foo.txt' will automatically pull in a '._foo.txt' for some reason?
[21:33:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Because ._ files don't exist
[21:34:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're generated by tar, as a way of storing HFS+ extended metadata for storage on non-HFS+ volumes

[21:34:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Generated by the Apple version of tar, I should say)
[21:35:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> So when you do `tar cv` you won't see them being archived, because they don't exist

[21:35:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> But when you do tar -x ...
[21:37:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ironically, Apple also provides a utility called dot_clean which will re-integrate the ._ files with their native files, which is great, except for the fact that dot_clean is available on Macs, which is precisely where you *don't* need it, but not available on the Unix box that you're sending your tarball to -_-

Twenty times in a row he’d confound the quidnuncs, as he put it, with the same trick, a bit of prestidigitation that resisted all the diagnostic hypotheses of his fellow magicians. The trick, as he eventually revealed, was a masterpiece of subtle misdirection; it consisted entirely of the _name_, “the
[22:54:55] <Obormot\Arcturus>  tuned deck”, plus a peculiar but obviously non-functional bit of ritual. It was, you see, _many_ tricks, however many different but familiar tricks Hilliard had to perform in order to stay one jump ahead of the solvers. As soon as their experiments and subtle arguments had conclusively eliminated one way of doing the trick, that was the way he would do the trick on future trials. This would have been obvious to his

[23:45:02] <kuudes> space lasers
[23:46:32] <quanticle> Elon's the type of guy who would unironically ask for one million dollars, just as a joke
[23:47:03] <kuudes> well, for him askind one billion dollars would still be weird
[23:47:10] <kuudes> *asking
[23:47:25] <kuudes> I guess one trillion dollars would signal him being lazy
[23:47:34] <kuudes> and we should then tell him to get a job
[23:47:54] <kuudes> and I am unsure if the world has quadrillion dollars. does it?
[23:48:48] <gwern> maybe zimbabwean dollars
[23:49:49] <quanticle> Right, he's already the richest person on earth (depending on how Tesla's share price is doing that day), so for him asking for a billion dollars (or even 100 billion dollars) is a bit of a joke. So he'll ask for one million dollars, just for the lulz.
[23:50:21] <quanticle> And the meme value will easily add another 10 or 15 billion to his net worth
[23:50:48] <quanticle> Because Tesla spikes whenenver Elon shitposts
[23:51:01] <quanticle> And what would this be, but the most magnificent shitpost of them all?
