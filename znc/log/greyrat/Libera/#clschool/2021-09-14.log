[12:33:30] <edgar-rft> ln43: yesterday you asked something about problem solvers and old-school AI from the 1980s. Peter Norvig has open-sourced his book "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming - Case Studies in Common Lisp" that describes most of the algorithms of that time. The code and links to free copies of the book can be found here -> https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp

[12:34:13] <ln43> ok, yes i was starting reading that book and i have the code and it works but later i switched to aima
[12:35:34] <ln43> now aima it's quite good in the book but the implementatio is archaic CL
[12:35:40] <ln43> n
[12:36:03] *** Joins: hendursa1 (~weechat@user/hendursaga)
[12:36:15] <ln43> on the contrary paip... good recipes but the content is no too much AI related maybe
[12:36:39] <ln43> ok... but book books are good
[12:36:51] <ln43> both 
[12:38:14] <White_Flame> AI used to be about logically encoding human decisionmaking into the machine
[12:38:29] <edgar-rft> I agree that AIMA is better for learning AI than PAIP but I was surprised that the book now officially is or free. I paid lots of money for it, but that was 20 years ago :-)
[12:38:45] *** Quits: hendursaga (~weechat@user/hendursaga) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[12:42:46] <edgar-rft> ...and the funny thing is that most programms from PAIP in the 1980s still *were* considered to be AI algorithms
[12:46:23] <ln43> the last version of the book is not free
[12:46:26] <ln43> latest
[12:46:40] <ln43> i was able to find a pdf of a previous version for free
[12:46:41] <White_Flame> what edition of AIMA is the latest?
[12:46:56] <ln43> shold be the fourth edition
[12:47:00] <ln43> should
[12:47:22] <White_Flame> yeah, just checked wikipedia
[12:47:40] <ln43> yes and it's pretty expensive
[12:47:53] <White_Flame> I think I read the 2nd edition
[12:48:02] <ln43> good...
[12:48:27] <White_Flame> yeah, that's the green one
[12:48:29] <ln43> i start reading the sections one and two only
[12:48:46] <ln43> and printed only those one
[12:49:41] <ln43> section two is about agents but i'm not finding easy to grasp what the implemenration is doing
[12:50:51] <ln43> that is why yesterday i was looking to alternative ways to enable a minimal introspection ability using structures and :include
