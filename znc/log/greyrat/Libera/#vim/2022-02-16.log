[15:53:03] <romainl> if there are, we should replicate the files in our repo and fix them there.
[15:53:56] <habamax> Are you about replicating help files?
[15:54:33] <habamax> or guards in some .vim files?
[15:54:51] <romainl> honestly, I'm used to making PRs from a "fork" (<-- huge quotes) of upstream but ours is not even remotely one of vim/vim so I am not sure of the correct procedure
