[00:14:41] <GreenJello> there is identity, though, which can be converted to a number like in my fiddle
[00:14:44] <nedbat> there is an address, js just doesn't provide a way to see what it is.
[00:14:58] <GreenJello> nedbat, not necessarily, no
[00:15:12] <nedbat> the data is *somewhere* :)
[00:16:01] <stenno> you can consider strictly equal operands to have teh same address, would that be fair?
[00:16:34] <GreenJello> only casually
[00:16:48] <stenno> then again that is of no value (no pun intended)
[00:16:51] <stenno> yeah
[00:17:10] <GreenJello> it's only required to compare identity, but you could have two identical objects with the same memory address plus an identity counter associated with them
[00:18:16] <GreenJello> the spec doesn't define a memory model
[00:19:17] <stenno> yep right
[00:19:48] <stenno> implementation detail

[00:23:47] <GreenJello> nedbat, as long as you can distinguish between "objects" (a JS concept) for equality comparisons, it doesn't matter how they're represented in memory
[00:24:37] <nedbat> GreenJello: i get that. i don't know what you mean by identity counter. if two objects are at the same address, how can they not be considered the same object?
[00:24:56] <GreenJello> objects don't have an address
[00:25:00] <GreenJello> objects are a JS concept
[00:25:09] <stenno> nedbat: do you know zend objects in PHP?
[00:25:18] *** Quits: devc (~user@gateway/tor-sasl/devc) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[00:25:47] <nedbat> GreenJello: yes, but every implementation has to put each object somewhere in memory.
[00:25:52] <nedbat> stenno: no. i know python
[00:26:39] <GreenJello> nedbat, consider: const a = { x: 1 }; const b = { ...a }; a === b
[00:27:15] <GreenJello> if we never modify 'a' or 'b' then there's no requirement that the engine actually allocate a new object for b
[00:27:15] <nedbat> GreenJello: right, that is false.
[00:27:30] <nedbat> GreenJello: where would it keep the identity counter?
[00:27:35] <GreenJello> it only needs to correctly say that they're not equal
[00:27:43] <GreenJello> high bits in a pointer or an extra tag
[00:27:49] <ljharb> nedbat: sure but that memory is not exposed in any way to the user
[00:27:59] <GreenJello> doesn't matter, none of this stuff has a specific size
[00:28:01] <ljharb> nedbat: so for all you know, one object has 73 locations in memory, and another one has 12, etc
[00:28:06] <nedbat> ljharb: we agree. we are just talking at different levels.
[00:28:21] <ljharb> right. and even thinking about memory addresses is a category error for javascript
[00:29:10] *** Quits: mexen (uid495612@user/mexen) ()
[00:30:07] <nedbat> i see what you are saying. diverdude was looking for some shorthand of identity that could be used for debugging. it's interesting that js doesn't provide one.
[00:30:30] <GreenJello> nedbat, in my example, at high optimization levels what you actually expect is that 'a' and 'b' are actually represented as a single 32 bit integer on the stack, and the equality comparison is a hard-coded false in the machine code
[00:30:39] <GreenJello> so the object doesn't even have to exist in memory
[00:31:27] <GreenJello> (in the typical sense of objects being heap allocated)
[00:31:59] <nedbat> yes, i see what you are saying

[01:08:16] <rannnn8888> sillyslux__ this the script https://dpaste.org/bCDn and this my json https://dpaste.org/9j9U  i mistake in the data ?
[01:08:48] <sillyslux__> rannnn8888, before `if(data.pk == old_count)` do `console.log(data)` to see if data is a string or an object (i.e. oarsed json)

[01:10:25] <sillyslux__> can you screenshot it?

[04:37:22] <entuland> not sure I understand the original task at all - joining by "&" is already concatenating and the requirement of stripping of &s seems to just immediately counter that joining with &s

[05:24:29] <GreenJello> well that explains it
[05:24:32] <GreenJello> don't do that
[05:24:56] <hans> i need them all..
[05:24:58] <entuland> sorry, I may have worded it badly - the _triggering_ of the error when the actual error happens, I meant
[05:25:08] <entuland> I assume firefox doesn't error out at all
[05:25:17] <hans> yes, firefox doesn't error out at all
[05:25:20] <hans> only chrome errors out
[05:25:31] <GreenJello> there's no point to making them all concurrently as the browser is only going to make a few at once
[05:25:55] <GreenJello> you're just filling up the queue
[05:26:28] <systemfault> Only 1442? :/
[05:26:30] <entuland> the queue is quite small if I remember correctly
[05:27:00] <hans> systemfault, yes, all the urls returned by this url https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/machine/?limit=999999
[05:27:12] <hans> (which is 1442 as of writing)
[05:27:17] <entuland> you definitely need to batch them
[05:27:29] <hans> entuland, only when running on Chrome, apparently.. works fine on firefox
[05:27:52] <entuland> I take that as a bug on firefox that is silently throttling your code :P
[05:28:09] <GreenJello> nah, the silent throttling is intended
[05:28:10] <hans> maybe firefox just has a bigger queue capacity than Chrome ^^
[05:28:35] <GreenJello> all browsers do it, but they're also free to limit how many requests you can queue up

[05:29:03] <entuland> ah yes I was mixing up concurrent connection limit and queue limit
[05:29:59] <wroathe> hans: Do you have control over that server? pokeapi.co? Or could you put a proxy in front of it that requests and caches that data, and serves that cache to the browser in a single request?
[05:30:47] <entuland> well, they're _actively_ trying to get as many entries as possible, the API has a limit param in the link mentioned above
[05:30:58] <entuland> so they could just request less entries
[05:31:51] <hans> wroathe, i don't have control over that server. i could put a proxy in front of it, but i was hoping to just have it all hosted by github pages, so i'm trying to not have to do that
[05:33:07] <entuland> but you can batch the requests to work around hitting the chromium limit?
[05:33:21] <wroathe> hans: How often does that data change? Could you cache that data in the repository and periodically update it?
[05:35:25] <hans> wroathe, can kindof think of it like this: changed 3 times in 1996; 3 times in 1998: twice in 1999; once in 2000; twice in 2002; 3 times in 2004; twice in 2006; once in 2008; twice in 2009; twice in 2010; (skipping) twice in 2021;
[05:35:43] <entuland> hans, also, did you try to see if only XHR is affected by the lack of that error raising? maybe fetch() isn't affected?
[05:36:14] <wroathe> hans: Ok, so periodically request the data, merge it into a single JSON file, and store it in the public directory you're serving through github pages
[05:36:26] <systemfault> That pokeapi thing... It doesn't have limits?
[05:36:37] <systemfault> Like... only X calls per Y minutes?
[05:36:49] <hans> systemfault, if it does have a limit, it's >10,000/h at least
[05:36:54] <systemfault> Ah ok
[05:37:07] <hans> but i don't know if it has a limit or not.
[05:37:31] <wroathe> hans: That 1. Reduces the load on their servers, 2. Let's you make a single request from the browser instead of hundreds or thousands, and 3. Will be much faster
[05:37:38] <hans> they brag about 60,000,000 requests/month tho
[05:40:22] <hans> wroathe, yeah i might have to do that, just to properly support chrome. kindof unfortunate as i don't intend to "maintain it" after it's done, but oh well
[05:40:39] <wroathe> hans: It's not really a browser support issue. Sending 1000s of requests from the browser is just bad programming.
[05:41:27] <wroathe> hans: From the sounds of it you'll only need to update it once a year at most. Hardly support if you ask me.

[12:09:00] <DrowningElysium> Hey I had to recreate a page in a different context so I am reusing some javascript. Everything is the same in term of elements but somehow the event now triggers twice. If I check the event first thing in the event handler there is one difference which is that isDefaultPrevented is returnFalse the first time and is returnTrue the second time. I am not sure how to go about debugging this. If I check the events on the buttons, it's
[12:09:00] <DrowningElysium> event listener is not even listed

[12:13:46] <silly> i think you can also make it break on every click, that should take you to the code segments in question (event listener breakpoints)
[12:14:10] <DrowningElysium> Well the jQuery parentelement.on( 'click', 'child-element', fn) only runs once. I have checked that
[12:14:28] <DrowningElysium> I also removed the file to check if I accidentally initialized it twice, but that is also not the case
[12:15:11] <silly> timeStamp is the same in both events, they seem to be triggered both at the same time?
[12:16:35] <silly> did you copy paste to a new js file? maybe you accidentally pasted twice?

[12:17:52] <stenno> vanilla js doesn't have straightforward event delegation like your jquery code snippet
[12:18:20] <silly> jQuery parentelement.on( 'click', 'child-element', fn)

[18:11:21] <entuland> odd, I thought that there was more than just a charset there - I really meant to ask "is there a charset named _only_ 'macintosh'"
[18:11:43] <entuland> like there are many windows 125 sets, IBM codepages and so forth
[18:12:09] <entuland> I guess that if iconv-lists it as supported, it's just matter of checking their examples and copypaste the working code

[19:56:00] <entuland> okay, I guess that you can't use the command line and you need to do that via JS?
[19:56:21] <entuland> you need to integrate that conversion inside of your program or something?

[19:57:14] <entuland> okay, must it be client side?
[19:57:30] <entuland> if you have control of the server that generates that CSV, you could do it server side
[19:57:52] <entuland> otherwise, to use iconv-lite client side you need browserify or something as explained in their github

[21:07:26] <wroathe> nedbat: It supports multiple types of browsers, Chrome, Firefox, and I think Edge IIRC. They all inherit from this BrowserType class. Only Chromium supports Chrome DevTools Protocol, and the derived class for Chromium is the only one with a valid definition of connectOverCDP

[21:09:28] <wroathe> nedbat: Here's the overridden method that the other browser types don't support. The functional alternative to this would be to just export modules for each of the supported browser types from playwright, and have the chromium module be the only one that exports a connectOverCDP function.

They've chosen to allow different implementations for each browser type via inheritance, but Javascript supports higher order functions, and higher order functions are a much cleaner and much simpler alternative to inheritance
[21:11:53] <entuland> if all you need is the picker, depending on bootstrap and jquery just for that looks like a lot of unnecessary work and added complexity
[21:11:55] <wroathe> for this. They're using pointless inheritance all over the place in this codebase
[21:12:01] <MaxFury> yes, but this one is used in the project and it is used in other places too so i can't change them all
[21:12:54] <wroathe> nedbat: Anyway, there's lots of head-scratching nonsense in that codebase.
[21:12:57] <entuland> I know it may seem daunting, but seriously, if the project needs bootstrap and jquery _only_ for the picker, the first thing I'd do would be removing bootstrap, jquery _and_ that picker from everywhere

[21:23:32] <entuland> actually, the whole idea you're trying to pursue with a dropdown that has to stay open with a multiselect set of checkboxes and the concurrent picker may be not very user friendly on mobile
