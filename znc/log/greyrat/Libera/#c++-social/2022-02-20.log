[00:01:00] <Faux> I do find the first one kinda interesting. As a group of people who are in the top 1% of wealth/earnings/etc. globally then presumably we probably should be doing something, eh? Or should we give up?
[00:02:30] <Faux> I mean, maybe we're not all top 1%.
[00:02:38] <Faux> Top 10%.
[00:06:49] <T`aZ> im like middle class. We are clearnly not in the same social category
[00:07:26] <Faux> I mean, compared to a PEASANT living in a dangerous country with no social safety net like Chad or the US.

[01:49:46] <T`aZ> cgi is super cheap, directing is barely present, minimal real world physics is not even respected, voice is dubbed iin studio and not even synched to video
[01:50:22] <T`aZ> seriously, it's as bad as reading code written by those

[12:18:57] <Renderwww> I would only watch indian movies where they start randomly singing and dancing or those over the top action movies

[15:50:43] <Carbonflux> i like watching Indian movies where there is a romance between people of different casts, where the upper cast person is innocent but kind and the lower cast person wise but also loving and both are really hot looking, their families object but love wins in the end, also they mix english and hindi when they speak.
[15:54:00] <Oxyd> ‚ÄúIndians‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhot looking‚Äù üßê
[15:54:46] <Carbonflux> they have nice sky and hair and tend to be sexually mature,
[15:55:08] <Carbonflux> the hot looking ones of course.
[15:55:25] <Carbonflux> not everyone can be all hot looking
[15:55:49] <Carbonflux> even here in Seattle, home of the Covid body.
[15:59:26] <Carbonflux> ah i meant skin
[16:02:47] <markuskj> where's our expert on india
[16:02:55] <Carbonflux> anyway, say you are a highly compensated tech worker, very sane and believe in Science, so of course you switch to working at home, you don't smoke or drink or whatever, you have a perfect diet and your yoga class is canceled, so you work and then workout, after a year of this your body is perfect, but you are stuck in your condo, so you can't use it for sex, so you decide to go jogging...

[21:29:59] <jotham> this is what happens when you tell the entire planet you can't feed a cat
[21:30:11] <jotham> someone in new zealand gives you practical advice

[21:30:43] <jotham> or you could just go get it food
[21:31:15] <hinst> The thing is, Sir Cat ate just recently so I am worried that he might get sick if I give him more food
[21:31:35] <jotham> are you slut shaming your cat
[21:35:04] <Oxyd> Force feed him till he pukes, then force feed him his own puke, then let him starve for a few days. That'll teach him.
[21:35:23] <hinst> RIP
[21:43:07] <Renderwww> the cat should just fetch some organic, free ranging mice
