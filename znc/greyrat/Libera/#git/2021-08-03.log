[00:11:57] <oncall-pokemon> oh would it. so I need to do `git pull origin HEAD` then I guess?
[00:12:16] <imMute> any reason you can't setup the remote tracking branch first?
[00:12:30] <imMute> and no, you'd want the name of your branch instead of "HEAD"
[00:14:16] <oncall-pokemon> I though HEAD just referred to the current one. I could setup a remote tracking branch, oddly i've been using git for years and have no idea what that is

[10:09:00] <lpapp> what is the matter?

[10:09:20] <ikke> and besides that
[10:09:24] <ikke> it could be unexpected
[10:10:01] <lpapp> okay, so maybe worktree is not meant for this bisecting use case.

[10:11:39] <ikke> bisecting does not really care about branches
[10:11:44] <ikke> it checks out commits directly
[10:12:05] <lpapp> yes, that is the trouble
[10:12:09] <lpapp> it modifies mtime
[10:12:17] <lpapp> for many many files along the process of bisecting
[10:12:29] <lpapp> so when you reset, you end up rebuilding so many things
[10:12:32] <lpapp> which is not productive
[10:12:32] <ikke> lpapp: why don't you understand that the files _are_ modified
[10:12:49] <ikke> so they _have_ to be rebuilt
[10:13:08] <ikke> Your problem is that bisect goes back and forth
[10:13:09] <lpapp> but the original build does _not_ have to be discarded

[10:14:47] <lpapp> I can clone, it is just a bit lame
[10:14:58] <lpapp> to make hard-copies for 30+ GB
[10:15:23] <ikke> git just changes the files that need to be changed to checkout a specific commit

[10:15:50] <ikke> that the mtimes are changed is a natural consequence
[10:15:53] <lpapp> actually, creating a backup branch for bisecting is still nicer than cloning
[10:15:55] <lpapp> foo-bisect
[10:16:06] <lpapp> but it is still not ideal as one has to remember to clean up manually
[10:16:29] <lpapp> I do not think I am debating mtime changes
[10:16:46] <lpapp> I am debating worktree could allow multiple worktrees with the same branch
[10:16:58] <lpapp> if nothing else in "force mode" (Yes, as a user, I want to do this)

[13:22:22] <Nomikos> hi!!!
[13:22:46] <Samian> what's more standard? forking a repo. create a branch from master. I update the branch with new commits. I merge branch to master, then I do a pull request to put my forked master over the original?
[13:23:23] *** Quits: randomuser (~randomuse@user/randomuser) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:23:49] <Samian> or is it...  repo owner creates branch. I fork the repo. I switch to the branch the owner created. I make new commits. I make a pull request. Owner accepts pull request and now my new commits are in the owner's repo branch. Then the owner can merge the branch back to master?

[16:16:04] <osse> drogas: it makes the current branch identical to the develop branch at origin (ie. potentially throwing away commits) and updates files to disk to match (ie. potentially throwing away uncommitted changes)
[16:17:00] <drogas> wait wait so that means that if I have changed some files and added lines of codes they will be replaces by the remote branch?

[16:20:27] <osse> lpapp: without --keep-base rebase does what it usually does: puts the commits on top of the other branch, making the history a straight line
[16:20:31] <lpapp> which means ammending commit messages, squashing commits, fixing commits that broke the build, etc.
[16:20:51] <osse> with --keep-base you get to do the cool rebase -i stuff, but the commits aren't actually put on top of the other branch

[16:53:51] <osse> merge could show a mix

[16:54:40] <osse> you're not alone in that
[16:55:14] <lpapp> which is the "merge"?
[16:55:26] <lpapp> default or keep-base?
[16:55:33] <osse> keep-base
[16:56:00] <osse> because if you use keep-base you still have to merge the branch to main afteewards instead of doing a fast-forward
[16:57:12] <drogas> okay looks like `git reset --head` is dangerous
[16:57:29] <drogas> and should only be used inside the branch reseting .e.g develop
[16:57:36] <osse> rebase --keep-base lets you use -i to squash and stuff, but doesn't actally re-base the branch (move its base).

[17:02:37] <lpapp> configure what else?
[17:02:55] <lpapp> when the MR gets merged from the gitlab UI, we practically get an extra merge commit in main for every MR

And now whenever I execute `git push -f` again, git bails out with that message. What really happened is that git is absolutely sure that `origin/branch_name` has all commits, but it actually hasn't. I'm trying to run `git fetch` to make git re-fetch the branch, but to

[20:32:53] <arkho> I am trying to set up unauthenticated Git server-based access to a repo. I have placed a 'git-daemon-export-ok' file in the repo on the remote server, but when I try to clone via git:// I am still told that either I'm denied access or the repo is not exported (it's not specific as to which).

[20:42:08] <thiago> does this suffice to you? And how does a new branch help you?

[20:45:22] <osse> if you git clone git://192.168.1.234/foo  and the repo is in  /var/whatever/projects/foo  you need to run git daemon --base-path=/var/whatever/projects

[23:35:52] <imMute> right.  if the new feature_1 implementation is totally new commits sharing nothing with the original.  then a straight rebase of feature_2 on top of new_feature_1 will try to bring along the original feature_1 commits, which you don't want to do

[23:36:39] <cagmz> got it, thanks
[23:36:42] <imMute> alternately, there's probably a way to do it using rebase's --onto option, but I don't know off the top of my head how

[23:50:20] <osse> cagmz: if you've rewritten/rebase feature_1 since feature_2 was created you can do  git rebase --onto=feature_1 feature_1@{1}  from  feature_2
[23:50:56] <osse> In English: take the commits from the old value of feature_1 to feature_2 and transplant them on top of feature_1
