[23:16:00] <branch14> chasecaleb: Thx, for looking into this. Let me know if I can help.
[23:17:25] <chasecaleb> branch14 Sure thing! OAuth is... great fun.
[23:18:53] <branch14> So I heard. ;)
[23:21:25] <munen> As long as we don‚Äôt have to register a Facebook or LinkedIn app for OAuth‚Ä¶ I tried both one week ago, it took a long time, many forms, I had to record videos explaining and so on and so forth.
[23:21:29] <chasecaleb> branch14: it's interesting that `localStorage.authenticatedSyncService` is undefined for you, whereas it's `GitLab` for me.
[23:22:08] <munen> From LinkedIn, I‚Äôm waiting to hear back. FB was faster and rejected the app without reason. Writing for more info wasn‚Äôt successful so far.
[23:22:43] <chasecaleb> munen: Ha, of course. I don't have FB either
[23:22:56] <munen> Creating the app in GitLab felt pretty much alien afterward as it only took seconds. Where were the weird MS CRMs, where‚Äôs the form that didn‚Äôt work, where‚Äôs the upload for the videos? It just worked. Unreal(;
[23:23:47] <munen> To make it sound slightly less suspicious: It‚Äôs for cross posting content from a CMS to Social Media for a customer.
[23:23:51] <chasecaleb> I use GitLab for my personal projects as well as at on a much larger scale at work. They're a great platform for all sorts of development needs.
[23:25:05] <munen> We do, too. Except that we moved the FLOSS projects that have some community potential back to Github, because it still seems that there‚Äôs more traction.
[23:25:57] <munen> We even ran a private instance of GitLab for about three years. In the meantime GitLab.com became very attractive, though, so we moved back.
[23:26:12] <chasecaleb> Yeah, GitHub still has a ton of inertia due to being around longer, especially for anything frontend development related
[23:26:32] <munen> My org files have been there for many years, already. So it‚Äôs been very easy to switch to this new fancy back-end that you wroteüôèüèª
[23:27:01] <chasecaleb> That's also how it went at my work. GitLab's a bit of a beast to feed and keep running smoothly when you have a heavy enough workload.
[23:27:52] <munen> True that!
[23:28:27] <munen> Gotta go for dinner with the wife. Thanks for everything and have a nice dayüôèüèª
[23:28:45] <chasecaleb> Enjoy, have a great day!
[23:30:52] <chasecaleb> branch14: when you get a sec, can you try doing `localStorage.clear()` via dev console, reloading, and attempting to sign in again?
[23:39:42] <chasecaleb> oh, also if you could go to https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications (doesn't matter what device so long as it's the same gitlab account) and verify that you see 'organice' listed at the bottom under 'Authorized Application'
[23:47:41] <branch14> organice is listed as Authorized application.
[23:49:00] <branch14> `localStorage.clear()` helped. I could sign in successfully!
[23:53:37] <chasecaleb> branch14: glad to hear it! so I think somehow organice is incorrectly clearing `localStorage.authenticatedSyncService` which obviously breaks things. I have no idea what's triggering that so far but I'll look into it so that we can avoid this happening again. If it occurs again, do me a favor and let me know on https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/739
[23:54:00] <branch14> It seems that at least for some requests the slash between the username and the project name is urlencoded to `%2F`.
[23:54:28] <branch14> chasecaleb: Sure, will do. Thx agein for your quick help!
[23:55:04] <chasecaleb> Yup, it's supposed to be like that when part of the URL's path. That's how gitlab distinguishes the project id from the the rest of the URL, since it can be user/foo, user/group/foo, user/group/anothergroup/foo, and so on.
[23:58:00] <branch14> I see. Pretty sneaky.
[23:59:21] <chasecaleb> You can also use an actual project ID which gitlab shows next to the project name in the top left, e.g. https://gitlab.com/chasecaleb/emacs.d has a project id of 18505842. Explaining that to users is obviously a pain though.
