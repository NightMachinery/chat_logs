[01:33:15] <serafeim> thank you josevalim makes sense
[01:34:00] <serafeim> benwilson512: yes i'm aware about dynamic supervisors. i jsut wanted to understand what advantage offers me using a tasksueprvisor instead of starting the task using `task = Task.async(fn -> do_some_work() end)` 
[01:35:03] <serafeim> the elixir exercism maintainers are very responsive and helpful. you may want to raise an issue on gh or visit the exercism slack and discuss it directly

[19:31:04] <Ankhers> I guess I just like to stir the pot a bit. I'm sorry.
[19:36:42] <rawtaz> no takers :D
[19:37:16] <KettleMan> I missed the question. >.<
[19:38:26] <wink> I am more surprised yo is still around
[19:38:42] <wink> wasn't that new and fancy 10 years ago? (if it is indeed yeoman, the js whateevr tool)
[19:39:17] <rawtaz> hm i think you might be thinking about yoman?
[19:39:27] <wink> https://github.com/deislabs/yo-wasm from the talk page
[19:39:30] <rawtaz> or yeoman or something
[19:39:35] <wink> yeah, yeoman
[19:39:38] <rawtaz> ah yes
[19:39:42] <rawtaz> is this yo think the same you mean?
[19:39:45] <wink> yea
[19:40:00] <rawtaz> oh ok :)
[19:40:02] <wink> but I guess by being a scaffolding tool it has not been replaced 5x over, which is honestly surprising in JS world
[19:40:11] <rawtaz> yeah

[19:56:35] <Ankhers> Are there any plans to differentiate between compile time configuration and runtime configuration? I'm working on a project where the difference seems to catch people up fairly often.
[19:59:51] <Ankhers> Maybe that can't be done though because you may override configuration at runtime.

[20:35:16] <tristan> you can't override compile time configuration at runtime
[20:35:37] <tristan> but yes, there has been work to correct this issue. the first step was when they added runtime.exs
[20:36:14] <tristan> I can't recall if the additional changes to have a different function call for compile time configuration (as in, instead of `Application.get_env`) was done yet. I'd look into that if no one here at the moment knows

[21:12:03] <Ankhers> meaning I use "evil-mode", so I use vim keybindings.

[21:14:11] <Ankhers> I tried using vscode a handful of times, but my muscle memory isn't there. I also know none of the keybindings and have made very little effort to learn them...

[21:16:28] <Ankhers> As long as people do not come in with the "us vs them" mentality, it is fine. I have had great conversations with people about how they use their editor (and workflows in general). People could stand to learn a lot if the conversation can stay civil. But I will refrain from continuing.

[21:19:14] <yassernasc> that's a perfect point of view ankhers, maybe the things have changed a bit on online discussions
[21:20:06] <yassernasc> this article is pretty impartial https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war
[21:26:56] <KettleMan> I couldn't agree me. Each person needs to use what they're going to be most efficient in. I don't like the mouse as much, and moving my hand back and forth between it and the keeb, so I tend towards vim. But it isn't like I detest or dislike people who use VSCode and its wide marketplace of extensions.

[22:19:09] <whk> vscode, textmate, vim and emacs are entirely different and it is wonderful, because it caters for different styles of work. i am just happy that elixir has tooling not dependent on an IDE.

[22:41:37] <tristan> Ankhers: sorry, wasn't clear. its only "compile time" if you use the value in a way it is read at compile time. so like if you have a `@constant Application.get_env(...)` in a module. That will not be overriden at runtime because it is done at compile time
[22:52:29] <whk> is there a fun way to run the same test cases against different config values? I have a Http wrapper module with 3 implimentations which should return the same results. 
[22:52:32] <rawtaz> Ankhers: i use vs code with vim keybindings of course, so i dont really get your comment about not having muscle memory. i suppose you mean with all the non-vim-key stuff?
[22:53:10] <rawtaz> i basically see the vim mode as a given, then which editor one runs "underneath" that is quite exchangeable

[23:56:36] <hoppity> Hi guys, I am building a module to run some operations on values that should only have up to two decimal places (kinda like money). I can't find any place to set my *decimal* precision in Elixir. Does anyone know if this can be done?
[23:57:22] <hoppity> I am aware of the Decimal Context but its "precision" attribute refers to the overall precision not just the decimals.
[23:58:03] <hoppity> I need to ensure that all my calculations use only two decimals so 0.99 + 0.01. = 1.00
