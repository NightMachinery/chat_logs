[00:51:23] <mouses> hi all - could use a little trouble shooting help - just restarted my server (standard digital ocean droplet, 2x xeon 2.0 cores, 4GB ram) and seeing a steady burn of 15% of the cpu from ZNC, even a half hour after a boot.  Seems abnormally high, and not sure where to start when it comes to finding out what's going on.

[00:59:10] <Casper> mouses, any networks that are not connected and trying to keep on connecting?
[00:59:35] <Casper> Or are you running 100+ users on there? :P
[01:04:11] <mouses> Casper: Heh :)  Nah, only like 6 uses - and perhaps a user might have a failed network or something, but that CPU usage seems extreme
[01:04:25] <mouses> it's just a strady 15% burn
[01:04:33] <mouses> steady*
[01:11:52] <Casper> Could still be a failing connection :p 
[01:12:12] <Casper> And 17% is not that extreme, if something is active, it's active. :P
[01:12:45] <Casper> You could enable [[adminlog]] and see if anything is going on that way, another option would be to re-start ZNC in [[debug]] mode and find out that way.

[17:55:41] <dskull> Q: what's the easiest way to import all my <othernetwork> channels into a new server?
[17:58:24] <DarthGandalf> rename the network and change the server to the new one
[17:59:14] <DarthGandalf> Or move them one by one
[17:59:39] <DarthGandalf> This use case became very common since May, but it couldn't be predicted before

[18:31:04] <adhawkins> Is this a message triggered by ZNC? "Disconnected from the network, and will not reconnect. Use /connect to reconnect again."
[18:31:12] <adhawkins> If so, any way to have it automatically reconnect?
[18:31:28] <adhawkins> Hard to know whether it's ZNC or the client (thelounge)
[18:31:41] <DarthGandalf> it's your client
[18:31:49] <adhawkins> Ok, thanks DarthGandalf. I'll ask there :)
