[00:46:46] <Bco1981> yeah... that was a long time ago
[00:48:01] <ButterNoodle> the excuse of "its made to be installed on a tablet" bullshit doesnt work with me since its only install base is 85% pc
[00:48:28] <Bco1981> it's for x86... that's not a tablet
[00:49:25] <ButterNoodle> there are a shit load of x86 "tablets

[00:52:33] <Bco1981> i guess a tablet could be powered by Atom... that would make it x86
[00:53:42] <ButterNoodle> I had an i5 tablet
[00:53:46] <ButterNoodle> dell made it
[00:54:35] <Bco1981> one of those tablet pc's ?
[00:55:02] <ButterNoodle> yea if it doesnt have a keyboard its a tablet
[00:55:04] <Bco1981> my previous work tried to give me one of those... couldn't work with it
[00:55:28] <ButterNoodle> it was good for walking around datacenters
[00:55:43] <Bco1981> the cover thing on it was a keyboard.
[00:55:56] <Bco1981> but it was not very sturdy
[00:56:47] <MootPoot> if it dosen't have a cock its a woman

[01:05:21] <MootPoot> so then i'll have to leave the power tools in the heated portion of the house

[01:17:16] <brainwash> ohh
[01:17:25] <brainwash> that was in France, not Canada
[01:17:28] <MootPoot> what
[01:17:29] <emmeka> why is this being told to me
[01:17:40] <MootPoot> females cant be pedophiles
[01:17:44] <MootPoot> society says so
[01:18:13] <MootPoot> speaking of, dont you have a hate boner for the church emmeka 
[01:18:17] <brainwash> "My mother blissfully told me that it was impossible for a nun to whom she entrusted her daughter to abuse a girl..."
[01:18:19] <Poeticode> MootPoot i think C-Span streams all of them, but I watched it via NPR's site
[01:18:24] <brainwash> even mom says it
[01:18:31] <Bco1981> emmeka: actually there is a different one... Say you're sorry...
[01:18:49] <MootPoot> church be fuckin
[01:19:31] <brainwash> but maybe it was just some form of exorcism ritual
[01:19:33] <emmeka> Bco1981 true
[01:19:34] <brainwash> who knows
[01:19:54] <MootPoot> bible black
[01:20:15] <emmeka> to rephrase: the key to success in married life is knowing that you should only ever use the words "yes" and "sorry", and knowing which time to use which word
[01:20:26] <MootPoot> I thought that was only half
[01:20:48] <MootPoot> the rest was predicting the future
[01:21:01] <emmeka> MootPoot I don't have anything to do with the Catholic Church in particular, but they're kind of mass murderers, so it's not the best
[01:21:28] <emmeka> my family was sent to Moravian residential schools. equal opportunity, protestants can be evil too
[01:21:34] <MootPoot> what
[01:21:43] <MootPoot> I thought protestants were the nice ones
[01:22:16] <brainwash> protestants are like the democrats
[01:23:00] <emmeka> not really, I mean evangelicalism in its entirety is a protestant tradition
[01:23:00] <MootPoot> DEMONcrats
[01:23:38] <MootPoot> the christian tree of sects makes no sense
[01:25:32] <emmeka> what about it doesn't make sense. it's relatively straightforward, once there was 1 church, then it split into Catholic in the west and Orthodox in the east, and then there was a big schism in the west where ten bazillion different sects all split off from Catholicism
[01:25:59] <theholyduck> theres also other weird offshoots
[01:26:01] <theholyduck> like coptics
[01:26:09] <emmeka> coptics aren't an offshoot, they're Catholics.
[01:26:18] <emmeka> they're in communion with Rome and all that
[01:26:58] <theholyduck> ... they have their own pope
[01:27:27] <emmeka> theholyduck no, most of them are actual Catholics.
[01:27:40] <Poeticode> if you're white and evangelical you're 90% likely to be republican
[01:28:10] <emmeka> there is an orthodox coptic church with its own see too
[01:28:39] <theholyduck> i mean strictly speaking theres like 2 main branches of coptic church. the ones in ethiopia and the ones in egypt. 
[01:28:48] <theholyduck> both orthodox 
[01:28:52] <theholyduck> but different
[01:29:03] <theholyduck> but i dont think either recognizes the pope
[01:29:30] <theholyduck> the ethiopian one is like real oldschool pre catholicism christianity
[01:30:11] <emmeka> there's a couple really ancient offshoots of oriental orthodoxy and shit, but I mean ignoring that (which itself isn't that complicated, these are all just traditions that predate the church of Rome)
[01:30:19] <emmeka> it's not very complicated
[01:30:38] <theholyduck> ok. but which coptic branch do you think of is the one that responds to the pope? 
[01:30:42] <theholyduck> because the 2 i know of definitly dont
[01:30:49] <MootPoot> cock brange
[01:31:06] <theholyduck> theres a bunch of the ethiopian variety living where i do
[01:32:08] <theholyduck> and the way you know they dont get along with most of the other christianity versions is they disagree about the nature of christ
[01:32:11] <emmeka> theholyduck looking it up, apparently I'm wrong about the demographics. There is an actual Coptic Catholic Church in communion with Rome, but they're the minority, and the Coptic Orthodox Church is the majority.
[01:32:28] <MootPoot> my package has been in transit from vancouver for 5 days
[01:33:06] <theholyduck> its always funny to me that some of those like weird theological splits are still around 
[01:33:29] <theholyduck> like is christ human and divine seperatly. or a divine human singularly
[01:33:33] <theholyduck> and the whole trinity stuff
[01:33:40] <MootPoot> 3 cocks
[01:33:54] <MootPoot> sounds like the end of evanglion
[01:34:59] <emmeka> I'm pretty sure you could write a reasonable theological thesis arguing that The End of Evangelion is a metaphor for the protestant reformation
[01:35:32] <theholyduck> its sort of intresting to me how like most of the really weird protestant offshoots 
[01:35:38] <emmeka> it'd be just as insane as any other attempt to interpret Eva, but writeable and would get a passing grade
[01:35:38] <theholyduck> ended up just going to or comming from america
[01:35:44] <theholyduck> like most of germany is just lutherans these days
[01:35:50] <emmeka> theholyduck well, they got killed elsewhere.
[01:35:58] <theholyduck> brits are anglicans generally :P 
[01:36:00] <emmeka> the anabaptists of Germany are alive and well here
[01:36:37] <MootPoot> I would like you to know
[01:36:44] <MootPoot> I have a new favorite type of underwear
[01:37:06] <MootPoot> briefs? no. Boxer briefs? no. I am now a OG boxer man
[01:37:12] <emmeka> theholyduck a weird one we got, that are still around, were doukhobors
[01:37:13] <MootPoot> knit plain boxers
[01:37:23] <emmeka> who were like Russian Christian fundamentalist anarchists
[01:37:34] <MootPoot> I want communist christians
[01:38:08] <emmeka> they were most famous for nudist arson attacks
[01:38:37] <emmeka> MootPoot I mean you live in Alberta, walk into a Hutterite colony.
[01:38:46] <emmeka> Hutterites live as socialists, effectively.
[01:38:53] <emmeka> and are not rare
[01:39:10] <Roey> <MootPoot> I want communist christians
[01:39:35] <theholyduck> i mean there also was a like communist jewish movement thing that took in a bunch of christians aswell.
[01:39:40] <theholyduck> struggling with the name right now
[01:39:43] <Roey> for communism to work, it needs a government which dictates and enforces the codes it subjects its citizens to.
[01:39:48] <theholyduck> but it was popular like 40 years ago
[01:39:57] <Roey> the State needs absolute control
[01:40:04] <MootPoot> ask luke-jr  lmao
[01:40:09] <Roey> religions work against that state control
[01:40:11] <theholyduck> kibbutz!
[01:40:32] <Roey> so - communism needs to kill religion
[01:40:47] <Roey> because it wants people praying to the STate
[01:40:49] <theholyduck> my 1 religious aunt lived in a kibbutz for like a year. 
[01:40:50] <Roey> not to God
[01:41:01] <Roey> theholyduck: oh awesome :)
[01:41:03] <MootPoot> is the state a cute waifu

[04:29:39] <duds-> it is clearly the opposite
[04:29:49] <duds-> religion has always been used to *justify* the state

[05:02:52] <Poeticode> first you have to define what religion is, cuz confucianism and certain sects of daoism have no gods to worship. in fact early religions (like 300bc to 200ad) were really how to govern people well and live a good life. Or even more broadly, to end human suffering.
[05:03:35] <Poeticode> western philosophy would qualify as religion if you make it that broad
[05:03:47] <ButterNoodle> over 2000 years later... still suffering
[05:04:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You don't need to have religion to have gods.

[05:05:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Some of them removed suffering by removing parts of the population from the matching set for "human" or "person".
[05:05:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Like Confuscianism.
[05:05:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No one's suffering if you don't recognize them as a person.
[05:05:45] <ButterNoodle> what if
[05:05:57] <ButterNoodle> their very existence is suffering for me
[05:06:04] <ButterNoodle> like seeing them on facebook
[05:06:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "Can't have suffering if everyone's dead"
[05:06:16] <ButterNoodle> or tweeting about making a turducken
[05:06:24] <Poeticode> well confuscianism is an interesting case in that it was just a belief system to teach to the ruling class to keep people in order. Their major texts were from the period of the Warring States

[05:07:39] <Poeticode> you can believe you're an atheist but i guarantee you have cultural assumptions and customs that would mirror religion. But that's just cuz of my looser definition of religion to allow confuscianism and stoicism and such
[05:08:43] <MootPoot> confusionism
[05:08:48] <ButterNoodle> yea its like saying ur an atheist when you still lean invitingly to the left and wipe ur ass with your right hand... just like jesus christ did
[05:09:18] <Poeticode> actually, exactly lol
[05:09:36] <ButterNoodle> a real atheist shits standing up and drags his ass on the bathroom rug..
[05:10:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Why not just use a bidet and use whatever hand isn't using the controls for wiping?

[06:06:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It looks like it might be uncomfortable to shoot standing.
[06:07:38] <ButterNoodle> people do it.. they are heavy
[06:08:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Even if I brace myself, I'd expect it to knock on my back.
[06:08:22] <ButterNoodle> last one I handled was 40lbs
[06:08:51] <ButterNoodle> naa.. they have little recoil. the massive weight and insane muzzle break tames it down quite a bit
[06:09:22] <ButterNoodle> if it was an 8lb bush rifle with no break, it would hurt a bit
[06:09:35] <ButterNoodle> :| brake
[06:09:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Aye, got it.
[06:10:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hm, maybe it looked worse than it is in that video
[06:10:06] <ButterNoodle> its a physics experiment :)
[06:10:41] <ButterNoodle> it does move you, and I see many girls firing them with the jiggle.. I think some of that is from the concussion of the brake
[06:10:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Non-newtonian fluids require less energy than you'd think to move?
[06:11:21] <ButterNoodle> like a jiggly ass :)
[06:12:19] <ButterNoodle> I wonder how much of the jiggle is a result of the recoil moving through the skeleton causing the meat to wiggle on the bone
[06:12:44] <ButterNoodle> I have handguns that have more recoil than that rifle in particular

[07:07:27] <JesseDesu> i think i messed up its ability to see grub
[07:07:37] <JesseDesu> i set fast boot off
[07:07:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: Weird. Are you installing grub-pc when you're using UEFI?
[07:07:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: I always set fast boot off, so that isn't it.
[07:08:02] <JesseDesu> i'm on a bios/mbr computer
[07:08:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Alright. Hm, are you using a separate boot partition?
[07:08:50] *** Quits: Cashlin (~hp@user/cashlin) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[07:09:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If not, be aware that grub filesystem support depends a lot on versions and btrfs isn't supported unless that has very recently changed.
[07:09:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I was pretty annoyed to find that out when rebuilding VMs...
[07:10:08] <MootPoot> I wonder if they look at the activity times on my work laptop and compare it to the timesheets I hand in
[07:11:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you've got suspicions you wouldn't still be there if they did, then they probably don't.

[07:17:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: What does your drive partitioning look like? Oh, and is the bootable flag enabled on your boot partition?
[07:17:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That flag isn't necessary for UEFI, but it's mandatory for BIOS iirc.
[07:18:00] <JesseDesu> it has the biosgrub flag enabled
[07:18:20] <JesseDesu> i used the debian11 installer
[07:18:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: Hm. What's the partition record label format?
[07:19:40] <JesseDesu> its the second partition
[07:19:44] <JesseDesu> sdc2
[07:20:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm not sure if that could be an issue, but I was more asking if the partition label is msdos or gpt
[07:20:08] <JesseDesu> sdc1 is a 1mb partition

[07:25:23] <ButterNoodle> yea but in 99 there wasnt good tape management in linux
[07:25:38] <ButterNoodle> I could have bash scripted it with flat file indexes
[07:26:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Well, the tar method I was thinking is mostly manual swapping, but yeah.
[07:26:14] <ButterNoodle> I think I was doing that with dlt before I said fuckit its too unreliable at home, and less of a pita to just do 1:1 backups
[07:26:45] <ButterNoodle> plus large tapes were expensive

[08:48:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: Before getting to the partitioning part in the expert mode of the installer, open a shell and use parted: parted /dev/my-drive-letters mklabel gpt
[08:48:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> erh, msdos
[08:49:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And then you'll be partitioning on a msdos label.
[08:49:30] <JesseDesu> how do you open a shell while its installing
[08:49:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The netinstaller menu, in expert mode, has an option near the bottom to drop into a shell.
[08:49:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And to go back to the installer, you just have to exit out of the shell.
[08:49:57] <JesseDesu> i guess i can do that with ubuntu
[08:50:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I think using the alt+fN keys might also work in every other mode.

[09:04:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Or least no significant one given the limited speed of spinning rust)
[09:05:01] <JesseDesu> ok
[09:05:16] <JesseDesu> maybe i should use a usb thumbdrive for boot
[09:05:20] <JesseDesu> and attach the 5TB
[09:05:23] <JesseDesu> for /home
[09:05:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The computer is 64 bit right?
[09:05:39] <JesseDesu> yes
[09:05:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Should be fine.
[09:06:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I was just trying to think of all the ways it could go wonky given your model seems to be on the wonkier end.
[09:06:24] <JesseDesu> yea
[09:06:50] <JesseDesu> i have a 1.5TB hdd which is my main hdd but its old
[09:06:54] <JesseDesu> like 2013 old
[09:07:29] <JesseDesu> i have a backup of it on a newer WD i got in 2018
[09:07:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: Hmm... well if you don't trust it overmuch, you could, once things are installed, use "sudo btrfs balance -mconvert=dup -dconvert=dup /" so that your data is stored twice on the drive for redundancy.
[09:07:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That'd only give you a safety net to not lose things when it starts failing.
[09:08:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Assuming you're using btrfs as root filesystem.
[09:08:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can't use it for boot partition, unfortunately. At least if your grub version isn't bleeding edge.
[09:08:37] <JesseDesu> i used over 50% of it tho
[09:08:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> oh. rip
[09:08:44] <JesseDesu> so if i double the data it wont fit
[09:09:24] <JesseDesu> grub is like 2.2 or something
[09:09:59] <JesseDesu> ok well, i can backup all the data i have on the 5TB drive
[09:10:11] <JesseDesu> and try using the 1.5 for a /boot
[09:10:19] <JesseDesu> but that seems scary
[09:10:28] <JesseDesu> i've been so attached to this sony hdd for years
[09:11:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Aye. If you're lucky, using "btrfs filesystem defragment -r -c$COMPRESSION /" where $COMPRESSION is either lzo, zlib or zstd depending on if your version supports it. (zstd is best but newer and not supported in old versions) 
[09:11:14] <JesseDesu> its like erasing a beautiful painting i spent years on, only to save a picture of it
[09:11:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Might free up enough space.
[09:11:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If your data is not compressible enough and you have no duplicates (duperemove than deduplicate btrfs)... then you're really out of luck.

[09:23:49] <PancakeMatsuri> some ~1.5%
[09:23:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> At this point... not a whole lot. Seagate are assholes who can't implement SMR properly. Toshiba are unreliable. WD Red are mid-range but at least they can implement SMR TRIM properly.

[09:29:36] <JesseDesu> if i just backup to a new hdd every year and keep every copy

[09:32:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's why btrfs and zfs reimplement it.

[09:32:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> > privacy | none

[09:33:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> PancakeMatsuri: Yeah. There's battery-powered cards that can somewhat alleviate the issue... but it simply cannot be fully fixed from that layer.
[09:33:26] <PancakeMatsuri> but I guess you get some privacy
[09:33:27] <JesseDesu> why cant i just ship a few hdds to a data center in the middle of the nevada desert behind nuclear blast doors and have them upload it so i can access it remotely
[09:33:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> JesseDesu: You can. It's just absurdly expensive.

[14:11:22] <DunceCotus> Why does the USPTO use design search codes?
[14:11:23] <DunceCotus> When examining your trademark application, we must determine whether a consumer is likely to confuse your mark with a registered mark or a mark in a previously filed application. To make that determination, examining attorneys and the public must be able to thoroughly and efficiently search the expansive USPTO database for marks that are similar to yours. 
[14:11:23] <DunceCotus> To focus the search, we assign a numerical design search code to each design element of your mark when we receive your application. A design element can be any component of your mark that is not a word, such as a depiction of a star or flower.
[14:12:12] <amigojapan> DunceCotus:"Registration Date:9/24/1974"are you sure that is the original?
[14:12:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so the logo was examined before it was trademarked and design elements identified, then they assigned design search codes
[14:12:25] <amigojapan> That is not so long ago
[14:12:38] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the point is what were they examining to suggest cornucopia was part of the design?
[14:12:58] <DunceCotus> they must have felt it was prominent enough to have as its own code
[14:13:23] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they ment "this can look like a cornucopia
[14:14:15] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's under "baskets of fruits"which a cornucopia is one
[14:14:19] <DunceCotus> The USPTO tries to assign design search codes for every significant element of your mark. Our major considerations are:
[14:14:19] <DunceCotus> If you were visually scanning a collection of marks, which features would help you pick out your mark?
[14:14:19] <DunceCotus> If you were visually scanning a collection of marks, which features would help you pick out a similar mark? 
[14:14:19] <DunceCotus> We also consider the description of the mark from your application and other statements you submit.  It is important that you accurately and completely describe all design elements of your mark.
[14:14:20] <DunceCotus> After we review your application and assign design search codes (if any), we will send your application to an examining attorney. Your examining attorney may add or delete design search codes if he or she determines that doing it will more accurately account for the all the design elements in your mark.

[14:37:46] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: just try to be mindful of changes in your perception etc, if things get worse you should get help.
[14:38:10] <KatrinValerie> Reducing stress or finding something relaxing to do can also improve your mental state
[14:38:18] <KatrinValerie> but I would not count on that alone
[14:38:23] <emmeka> KatrinValerie that's not a helpful piece of advice, he wouldn't know when it's too far gone.
[14:38:41] <DunceCotus> 2 far 3 go
[14:38:41] <amigojapan> emmeka: it's probably already too late for DunceCotus . He has a world view that nobody really shares. He is convinced we live in a flat earth that is made up like a soap bubble
[14:38:43] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: Well, he already was at a psychiatrists so what do?
[14:38:43] <emmeka> you need to talk to others in your life and have them be aware
[14:39:04] <DunceCotus> It's too late for me.. save yourselves!
[14:39:16] <KatrinValerie> True, people around you are often the first to notice

[14:41:10] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: the people around me couldn't recognize it either till things got very extreme and I started seeing things
[14:41:36] <KatrinValerie> Because it just seemed so very plausible, they were convinced my delusions were actually true x.x
[14:41:38] <DunceCotus> I see
[14:41:43] <emmeka> KatrinValerie even doctors are bad for that. they don't do anything until it is too late.
[14:42:16] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: well, they don't get payed as much for preventive care
[14:42:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: what is now likely, that every body else is completely wrong about the universe or that you are just wrong?
[14:42:41] <amigojapan> More likely*
[14:42:47] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: perhaps we're both right, and wrong
[14:42:49] <emmeka> I mean I get it, antipsychotics are heavy meds with side effects, but they are necessary on occasion
[14:43:14] <darkwitch> amigojapan, are you believing that the universe is the same for everyone?
[14:43:39] <DunceCotus> antipsychotics are not fun, but for some they are indeed necessary
[14:43:40] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: and if there are regular psychiatric appointments you can have a waitful watching approach to an extent
[14:43:44] <amigojapan> darkwitch: well, it's not flat earth like DunceCotus believes
[14:43:48] <darkwitch> I think it's experienced differently by everyone, and that is their reality
[14:43:57] <KatrinValerie> And not everyone with psychosis needs antipsychotics
[14:44:01] <DunceCotus> the Earth is flat-chested
[14:44:04] <KatrinValerie> it depends on the underlying disorder
[14:44:22] <emmeka> don't they though
[14:44:34] <KatrinValerie> psychotic depression or bipolar depression can often be treated without antipsychotics
[14:44:36] <emmeka> they give you the same basic kind of meds regardless of if you're bipolar or schizo or whatever
[14:44:55] <emmeka> at least temporarily
[14:44:57] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: I get Lamotrigin and an antidepressant, no antipsychotic
[14:45:06] <emmeka> hmmm.
[14:45:12] <DunceCotus> for some its not necessarily psychosis
[14:45:16] <KatrinValerie> I wasn't put on antipsychotics in the inpatient care either
[14:45:18] <DunceCotus> you can hallucinate without it being psychosis
[14:45:29] <KatrinValerie> true, it might be complex ptsd
[14:45:42] <DunceCotus> schizophrenia isn't even necessarily hallucinatory
[14:45:45] <KatrinValerie> but idk, really seeing someone who is not there
[14:46:18] <DunceCotus> KatrinValerie: what did you see?
[14:46:21] <KatrinValerie> DunceCotus: usually hallucinations are a key feature, but auditory hallucinations are far more common
[14:46:21] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: believes hallucinations are reality tho
[14:46:34] <DunceCotus> its complicated

[14:47:09] <KatrinValerie> darkwitch: for the person who has them, yes
[14:47:16] <KatrinValerie> it can be quite frightening
[14:47:18] <darkwitch> yes, it's a personal reality that does not apply to everyone else
[14:47:40] <DunceCotus> I've never had realistic hallucinations like that (that I can recall)
[14:47:48] <DunceCotus> but maybe im a delusional sod
[14:48:06] <amigojapan> darkwitch: reality is a realm where sane people share shared experiences
[14:48:07] <emmeka> usually the break with reality will happen well before any hallucination, by then it is too late, and even then hallucinations are more often sounds than sights
[14:48:37] <darkwitch> amigojapan, not everyone shares that definition of the word
[14:48:48] <darkwitch> but I will say it's a common one
[14:49:07] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I invented that definition
[14:49:21] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: eh, perception is very different across sane persons
[14:49:42] <KatrinValerie> And some people process their senses input differently
[14:49:50] <KatrinValerie> eg autistic people or people with adhd
[14:50:10] <DunceCotus> some people see a blue and black dress, others see white and gold
[14:50:13] <DunceCotus> I see blue and gold
[14:50:26] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: anyway we are all agreeing we are typing at a computer now and stuff like that
[14:50:51] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Maybe I am using a speech to text program to input this, no I am using a keyboard
[14:51:13] <KatrinValerie> But I guess that is something we can agree on for the most part
[14:51:26] <KatrinValerie> by using typing and computer in the broadest possible sense
[14:51:34] <KatrinValerie> I need a coffee
[14:51:43] <darkwitch> my nose did not smell tetramethyl acetyloctahydronaphthalenes at first, now it does
[14:52:15] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: that would be in the realm of the realistic, but if you said you are speaking to spirits that covey your messages to IRC then there would be a problem
[14:52:21] <emmeka> I think in shrink-speak a "hallucination" is when your senses experience something that isn't really there (seeing things, hearing things), and a "delusion" is a belief that has no basis in reality and is held despite all evidence to the contrary, and that isn't just a cultural or larger religious notion.
[14:52:27] <KatrinValerie> darkwitch: I can smell delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the air
[14:52:47] <KatrinValerie> jk, in reality I smell the terpenes

[14:54:01] <amigojapan> emmeka: except when you know the hallucinations are not real, then they are called pseudo hallucinations
[14:54:22] <DunceCotus> there may be all sorts of layers we block out cause our socius has not integrated such layers into its notion of reality
[14:55:03] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I get those on psychedelic drugs
[14:55:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: though it gets to the point where synchronicities and reality distortion does seem to actually be 'real', or requiring navigating the world differently

[15:02:01] <darkwitch> if I imagine something in my mind, it is there, to me, but it's not accessible to you

[18:01:49] <darkwitch> the alkemias should sit for a few days before testing, but hexennacht smells all right, arcanum quite different and arabesque the most pleasing so far
[18:08:13] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I am glad you got something you liked this time. Did you embrace your inner swamp?

[18:10:18] <zoidberg> amigojapan: sorry, I was a bit afk. I think one should at least keep the shampoo for 3 min on hair
[18:10:49] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it's funny
[18:11:04] <zoidberg> amigojapan: I apply the shampoo, scrub, get back to body and then wash hair
[18:11:13] <amigojapan> zoidberg: ok I will try that
[18:11:27] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I did that today
[18:12:26] <zoidberg> amigojapan: I am also not sure if shampoo works better if it is left on hair for a while
[18:12:53] <darkwitch> too long is probably not helpful
[18:13:18] <zoidberg> not too long, I mean like couple of minutes
[18:13:19] <darkwitch> I like it better if I shampoo twice
[18:13:38] <darkwitch> instead of keeping it on for long
[18:13:57] <zoidberg> I used to do that darkwitch but got lazy

[18:17:45] <amigojapan> darkwitch: my guess is it is a chemical reaction. When we wash our clothes, the washing machine keeps the soap around a long time
[18:18:24] <darkwitch> amigojapan, you get more delicious foam the second time
[18:19:35] <amigojapan> darkwitch: but even if you do it twice, leaving it on a longer time probably allows the chemical process to take place

[18:32:34] <amigojapan> Yup

[18:33:40] <darkwitch> isn't corona cases going down a lot?
[18:34:24] <amigojapan> In Japan we are just past the fifth wave, but I think waves will continue to get worse

[22:19:31] <Bco1981> windows 11 didn't fix my problem using the oculus with my laptop.
[22:19:59] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: get external GPU
[22:20:25] <Bco1981> i'm not sure that would help, since the rtx 3080 in there kinda is a "extra" gpu
[22:20:55] <KatrinValerie> That should be enough to power these glasses really
[22:21:02] <KatrinValerie> or is the mobil version just garbage?
[22:21:28] <MootPoot> mobil = desktop 3070
[22:21:34] <MootPoot> generally
[22:21:53] <MootPoot> the mobile version is one tier down or so of the comparable desktop part
[22:22:00] <Bco1981> the problem is that the hdmi isn't directly wired to the 3080, so the glasses don't turn on because the video isn't sent directly through the hdmi.
[22:23:54] <Bco1981> acording to ... userbenchmark... tests... this 3080m is between 1080 and 1080ti
[22:24:47] <MootPoot> meh, userbenchmark is...

[22:28:19] <snake> i have replayed it way too many times tho
[22:28:19] <groovy> how did the 90s/2000s have things like Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell

[22:28:25] <snake> sss
[22:28:29] <snake> it was cute
[22:28:37] <MootPoot> usually its 20% slower then the desktop one, but thats if the chip is the same
[22:28:47] <BritKnee> dude I just find it cool that people still use irc
[22:29:02] <MootPoot> seems like the mobile 3080 is about 20-30% smaller then the desktop one AND also is power nerfed
[22:30:44] <Bco1981> yeah
[22:31:05] <snake> irc is great
[22:31:38] <Roey> groovy: was 2000 > 1990, in your mind
[22:31:51] <Roey> 2000 had less "WTF"-isms in culture, it feels like.
[22:31:57] <Roey> like... 90s clothin
[22:31:59] <Roey> clothing.
[22:32:07] <Roey> you can identify 70s clothing, 80s clothing, 90s clothing
[22:32:24] <Roey> but clothing from 2000-2010, it looks the same to me as what we wear now.

[22:40:54] <brainwash> astroboy is a japanese cartoon

[22:41:31] <Matt|home> sorry i haven't been keeping up with the convo , but in general are you familiar with the different genres that exist Roey ? there's a lot of common tropes and stuff across genres in anime
[22:41:40] <Matt|home> FMA imo is depressing as all fuck
[22:41:48] <Roey> Matt|home: of course (I've been watching anime for 25+ years, yeah)
[22:41:58] <BritKnee> I never finished it unfortunately

[22:48:01] <groovy> JesseDesu: why would you do that in the first place 
[22:48:14] <BritKnee> Do you think it will be worth "upgrading" to Windows 11 when it comes out
