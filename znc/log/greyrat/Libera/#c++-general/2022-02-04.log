[01:35:48] <PJBoy> good for you
[01:35:49] <CarloWood> If it would fail, then the object and/or program is in an inconsistent state, which is just a bug - so crashing or asserting is completely ok and should never happen.
[01:35:56] <Alipha> This is probably a horrible idea, but what about a language feature where you can have multiple exceptions being handled at the same time? Like, if Foo and Bar are thrown, unwind until either catch(Foo) or catch(Bar) is reached. Execute the catch block, and then automatically throw the other exception that hasn't been handled yet
[01:36:49] <kalven> I feel you are going in the wrong direction
[01:36:54] <Alipha> Lol
[01:37:09] <rpav> how would multiple exceptions _occur_
[01:37:24] <rpav> like you can already handy <Ts...> exceptions
[01:37:40] <Alipha> rpav: when a dtor throws an exception while another exception is already being handled
[01:37:45] <rpav> Alipha: ahh right
[01:38:06] <rpav> Alipha: probalby the better way to handle it is top-of-stack handling rather than unwind-handling
[01:38:56] <yolo> i will live with log/forget or log/assert-abort based on how serious the errors are for now
[01:39:00] <rpav> if "error occurs" doesn't unwind it, and error_handler(T) runs and has its _own_ error, then you still have error_handler(T1) bound and it will occur on top of that, without unwinding or losing anything or having to just give up and die
[01:39:03] <Alipha> And if a catch can handle both Foo and Bar, eg, catch(std::exception), then first run the catch block with Foo and then rerun it with Bar :-)

[01:43:30] <PJBoy> exceptions still a hot topic
[01:43:34] <rpav> e.g. you have register<SomeError>(fn...); and register<OtherError>(fn2...); .. and error<T>(); calls the appropriate registered function

[01:43:56] <rpav> then `throw recover<T>();` if appropriate and catch() where you want to pick up and continue
[01:43:57] <PJBoy> within your own code, it's much more debatable
[01:44:07] <yolo> then how does many projects(google,llvm,etc) can do without exceptions?
[01:44:15] <CarloWood> What I do is throw an exception when something fails. I don't are where I am. Then when I start running into those (uncaught) exceptions in the further I'd add code to recover :P.

[01:46:27] <PJBoy> unless you avoid constructors and operators

[01:46:42] <PJBoy> the trifecta of things to ignore in C++
[01:46:43] <yolo> dtor will log or abort
[01:46:47] <rpav> the flag thing is so terribl eheh
[01:46:53] <yolo> but the stdlibs do not provide error-returns bother me
[01:46:59] <CarloWood> Sounds like my approach though: I consider ANY error to be unacceptable to the point that the correct assumption is that they don't exist; because if they do exist they have to be fixed immediately so that they don't exist.  Hence, I encounter every error (if they exist) once and then fix them. That means that recovery code is bullshit. Let it crash.
[01:47:02] <PJBoy> and operators?
[01:47:22] <rpav> if you _really_ want to check, use some kind of factory and return optional<T> or something
[01:47:28] <PJBoy> suppose I do `string concat(string x, string y) { return x + y; }`
[01:47:36] <PJBoy> and string::operator+ fails
[01:47:39] <PJBoy> which it can do
[01:48:47] <rpav> presumably calling that function could fail before it enters the function
[01:49:00] <PJBoy> it could
[01:49:06] <PJBoy> the string ctors can fail
[01:51:31] <PJBoy> so in yolo's world I'd have to write something like `string concat(string x, string y) { if (x.failed() || y.failed()) { string ret; ret.setfail(); return ret; } return x + y; }` or some such
[01:51:45] <PJBoy> or maybe use an error return code?
[01:51:53] <PJBoy> but that would be inconsistent, because string already has a fail state

[01:57:38] <Alipha> Not really feasible in c++, but another such language could have objects with a fail state where any operations performed on objects in a fail state are just not done. Like how ostream/istream works

[08:42:22] <ville> Alipha: i've brought up it before, it's just functions of course since can't have return types on ctors. they look like: struct aa {/* stuff */}; result<aa, err> aa_new(/*param list*/);

[08:56:40] <ville> you can still use the c headers either the .h or the non-.h ones
[08:57:12] <yolo> c_func(&my_struct,myargs) can do dtor manually, not as good as automatic dtor, but at least you can have the manual one
[08:57:37] <ville> it's the automatic part that is the killer feature

[08:59:41] <yolo> wish there is a STL that is Result/error-code returned, EASTL can't do that either
[09:01:01] <ville> oh yeah anything i do probably doesnt apply to embedded. i program for the "desktop" most of the time, i don't do any kind of truly restricted emdedded. i guess something like atmega32u4 would be the "smallest" embedded i've tried
[09:01:45] <ville> but that's big enough that you can have an operating system and your "application" running on it
[09:02:32] <yolo> (c with ctor|dtor) = c++ + c-headers + nothrow-functions(new,delete) + your-own-container
[09:03:29] <yolo> not that bad actually, libstdc++ is about 4MB on embedded device and automatic-dtor make that extra library space worthy
[09:03:48] <ville> well i don't end up calling delete really. placement new.
[09:05:44] <ville> also if you go this route i would suggest that you make your containers to always require an allocator passed to them. don't default to anything. that'll set you up for the future where you want/need to care about the allocator as all your functions are already setup taking in an allocator
[09:06:31] *** Quits: _mikey (~mikey@user/mikey/x-4335048) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[09:06:39] <ville> so you can then fairly easily experiement on a "subsystem" how it performs with different kind of allocator, just by switching the kind of allocator you hand off to it
[09:07:01] <yolo> that makes sense for sure, custom allocator is important indeed
[09:07:07] *** Joins: _mikey (~mikey@user/mikey/x-4335048)

[09:10:17] <ville> but it would mean writing docs. yuk! right?
[09:10:46] <yolo> not really, but if you want to make it popular then yes, at least doxygen some
[09:16:25] <ville> also don't even default the allocator parameter for any of the functions. i've found if i do that i then do poorly passing along the correct allocator. there's then always that one call where i forgot to pass in the allocator passed to this function and ended up making using the default argument allocator which was the system allocator pass-through
[09:18:10] <ville> so no: result<aa, err> ff(allocator& a = default_allocator);
[09:21:42] <yolo> http://ix.io/3OB1  there are close to 400 functions in libstdc++ that has nothrow, means they actually return error-code, filesystem seems doing it all
[09:21:59] <yolo> i mean noexcept these days
[09:23:05] <ville> filesystem is deceptive. even if you use an overload that has error_code out parameter doesn't necessarily mean the function won't throw

[09:29:34] <yolo> well assuming your 'deceptive' is not that unsafe, that is
[09:31:34] <ville> sometimes the problem to get to use the noexcept function may be having to had constructed somthing that can throw in its ctor though
[09:32:59] <yolo> time for bed, thanks for the insights, very helpful and pull me back from ood-in-c
[09:33:21] <ville> but i've not really bothered to look into that: what part of c++'s standard library is noexcept
[09:34:44] <yolo> it seems all bitset, chrone, future, atomic, mutex, string. coroutine,span,... are doing that, one day might be: other than containers all can be noexcept
[09:39:54] <yolo> one day someone add a Result-STL, c++ will beat golang handly as you don't need read 1000-page on how to do exception handling correctly in c++

[12:07:34] <xkoncek> in 30 years, did noone come up with a way to convert a string to enum without dispatching tables?
[12:08:34] <Haohmaru> i want that, and also in the opposite direction
[12:08:43] <Haohmaru> pls Santa
[12:09:19] <Haohmaru> xkoncek i was told "reflection" is gonna allow such things
[12:09:21] <Haohmaru> supposedly
[12:10:54] <xkoncek> if c++ had better handling of constexpr strings and then if there was a consteval function mapping enum -> string, then i can imagine having a reusable solution
[12:11:44] <xkoncek> reflection... if it provided that last function
[12:11:50] <xkoncek> getting identifier name
[12:12:36] <Haohmaru> very often i have some enum and something sets it, and i just wanna print it to see what it's set to.. but it gets printed as an integer
[12:12:53] <Haohmaru> this is since.. forever
[12:13:40] <Haohmaru> and i don't even think i've heard of like a gcc extension to do it.. "pls make me an array of strings for this enum"

[13:01:20] <ville> if the enum values are contiguous, it can use lut, if it's not then it sortofkindof starts to look like it has to use a hash table
[13:01:36] <AliceMeows> Technically GCC as some extension for this
[13:01:39] <AliceMeows> has*
[13:02:10] <xkoncek> ville yes except there is a runtime difference between using a hash map [string -> object] and [enum -> object]
[13:02:10] <ville> xkoncek: would it offer a runtime lookup or just build time? sometimes it's entirely reasonable to make a runtime lookup. say you want to serialize an enum value into  afile as  string
[13:03:12] <ville> xkoncek: at any rate the solution in c++ right now is you are responsible for it. generate the code with a separate compiler or the preprocessor
[13:03:22] <xkoncek> ville what i was getting at was this use case: you read a csv. table at runtime (start of application), you have your corresponding enums and now you just want to associated the read values with that enum
[13:04:10] <ville> xkoncek: so not what you proposed: std::get_name<> template which would be compiletime only
[13:04:20] <xkoncek> you read a row, you read a string and want to assign the enum the corresponding value
[13:04:30] <ville> xkoncek: the answer is still macros
[13:04:34] <xkoncek> get_name was just a possible way to create a helper function
[13:04:39] <AliceMeows> If those values are constant then you're good but otherwise you could store pairs of values with a string in some container
[13:04:43] <Haohmaru> nooooo, no macros pls
[13:05:53] <xkoncek> at any rate there dafinitely has to be compiler support for mapping at least enums -> $enum_name
[13:06:19] <xkoncek> could return a string view or a const char*, idk
[13:06:23] <AliceMeows> If you're using gcc you could develop a plugin to help you do it
[13:06:27] <ville> of course there is. the language designers were just complete idiots and didn't think reflection was a useful thing
[13:06:45] <ville> the idea was either you use the preprocessor or a separate pre-compiler
[13:06:55] <Haohmaru> bleh
[13:07:08] <Haohmaru> or you.. manually make a LUT or $whatever
[13:07:10] <xkoncek> ville you know about the reflection proposal, is there anything like this?
[13:07:19] <ville> yes and yes*
[13:07:37] <xkoncek> now lemme see if it is accepted into c++23

[14:01:48] <LordKalma> and then use string-bases signal connections that work thanks to the meta-info
[14:02:06] <LordKalma> but yeah, QObject being single inheritance only is a pain sometimes
[14:02:07] <AliceMeows> I've never used the string based signals because they're too slow
[14:02:20] <AliceMeows> You could always use CopperSpice instead
[14:02:42] <LordKalma> string-based signals are an extra lookup on the moc table
[14:02:45] <LordKalma> are they thaaat slower?
[14:02:50] *** Joins: joilerv (~joilerv@80.169.238.242)
[14:03:16] <AliceMeows> It will never be as fast as regular pointers
[14:03:45] <LordKalma> sure
[14:04:03] <LordKalma> but you have an event loop anyway
[14:04:32] <AliceMeows> It doesn't matter, those string based signals were just too slow for my taste
[14:04:49] <AliceMeows> I like my software fast not slow, if I wanted that I'd write it in java or c#
[14:05:10] <LordKalma> but my point is
[14:05:23] <LordKalma> I never looked into how the event loop works, perhaps you can explain it to me
[14:05:29] <LordKalma> but doesn't it have an inherent refresh rate?
[14:05:41] <AliceMeows> It depends on the host
[14:05:56] <AliceMeows> I have no idea how its implemented on linux but I do know how it works on windows
[14:06:14] <LordKalma> want to share? I'm honestly curious
[14:06:39] <AliceMeows> On windows it utilizes regular event loop the whole GetMessage thing
[14:06:48] <AliceMeows> So the rate is entirely controlled by windows itself
[14:07:12] <AliceMeows> You can however trigger it if you want to via timers for example
[14:07:12] <ville> AliceMeows: may come as a surprise to you that quake, game from 96, does string-based dispatch for its input

[14:07:29] <AliceMeows> That is surprising
[14:07:38] <AliceMeows> How did it perform?
[14:07:49] <xkoncek> for a closed set of actions?
[14:07:58] <LordKalma> interesting, I wonder how windows handles the message loop haha
[14:08:00] <ville> AliceMeows: great?
[14:08:14] <AliceMeows> That's impressive
[14:08:18] <LordKalma> since GoldSrc comes from the Quake engine, I wonder how much legacy of that is in Half Life
[14:08:22] <LordKalma> of even in Source or Source 2
[14:09:06] *** Quits: joilerv (~joilerv@80.169.238.242) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[14:09:07] <ville> user-input happens so infrequently doing some hash table lookups does not even register for a cpu
[14:09:35] <xkoncek> tell that to pro starcraft players
[14:09:38] <LordKalma> wait, does Quake also have a server-side tick rate?
[14:09:50] <ville> yes
[14:09:55] <LordKalma> because in GoldSrc, whatever your FPS, the "server"/backend has a fixed tick rate
[14:10:11] <xkoncek> that makes sense
[14:10:14] <ville> xkoncek: it's still infrequent as far as a cpu is concerned
[14:10:33] <LordKalma> xkoncek, I think Quake engine devs were afraid of multiplying by delta_t hahah
[14:10:47] <ville> LordKalma: huh?
[14:10:58] <LordKalma> ville, because of the fixed tick rate, just a joke :)
[14:11:33] <ville> LordKalma: you'll multiply by delta just the delta is fixed. having non-fixed delta is a source of whole slew of issues
[14:12:23] <LordKalma> yes, I don't consider multiplying by a fixed value an operation per se. You can just of it as "ajusted values"
[14:12:30] <LordKalma> but yeah, you're right, I was only joking
[14:13:33] <LordKalma> console devs have it easy
[14:13:34] * LordKalma ducks
[14:14:00] <LordKalma> (well, they are the only knows who know the *exact* hardware the game will run on)
[14:15:29] <LordKalma> xkoncek, good think starcraft doesn't run on GldSrc or Source. 60 ticks per second is too long for their input rate
[14:15:37] <LordKalma> it's insane the stuff they do
[14:16:02] <AliceMeows> For best performance specialized code is needed built up to some spec
[14:16:48] <PJBoy> for best performance, remove all your code and write `int main(){}`
[14:17:03] <AliceMeows> Why stop there?
[14:17:13] <LordKalma> Ars Technica has a series on youtube called "war stories" with interviews with game devs from last century
[14:17:17] <LordKalma> it's amazing the stuff they do
[14:17:27] <PJBoy> maybe a call to abort would be faster

[14:17:47] <LordKalma> even has an extended 3h version of that
[14:18:02] <AliceMeows> You could get rid of the entire C initialization code and just have void _start() {}
[14:18:23] <LordKalma> I really recommend watching that
