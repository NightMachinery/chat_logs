[07:48:47] <copec> lisp123: I’m not an advanced programmer, but I like putting when and unless checks in :before methods
[07:49:51] <lisp123> copec: Good idea. Do those have access to the inputs to the primary method (I don't use anything apart from the primary method currently)
[07:49:57] <lisp123> ?*
[07:53:11] <beach> Of course.  The lambda list must be "congruent".

[21:39:44] <lisp123> Would it be possible to finish PAIP in three months?
[21:40:09] <mfiano> Absolutely.
[21:40:32] <lisp123> Great
[21:41:09] <mfiano> A good portion of the beginning is a refresher on Common Lisp, and the programs are not very difficult to understand. I got through half of the book in a week, and that was with me rewriting the programs in a more modern style to understand them better.
[21:41:35] <lisp123> I see. Did you do the exercises also?
[21:41:37] <mfiano> His other book is a different beast, Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach - 4th edition
[21:41:39] <lisp123> (those can take time)
[21:41:53] <mfiano> Expect that one to take a year or more
[21:41:58] <mfiano> I did some
[21:41:59] <lisp123> Have you finished AIMA (I think I saw you mentioning reading it before)
[21:42:28] <mfiano> I didn't start reading it yet. I was planning on doing it when I'm done with PAIP, but Emacs config is on the front burner right now.
[21:43:07] <lisp123> Hopefully you can get your ideal Emacs setup
[21:44:07] <mfiano> I already did, but I'm now just refreshing my old forgotten knowledge on effective Orgmode usage by reading the documentation, because I would like to start using the Zettelkasten method with OrgRoam
[21:44:35] <mfiano> Once I configure Orgmode and OrgRoam appropriately for my workflow I will be back to CL and reading about CL :)
[21:44:58] <lisp123> I'd be curious on how you go, I was thinking about Org Roam and Zettelkasten, but never got around to it. I did a bit of Org Agenda though, that's been helpful for full text searching
[21:45:28] <lisp123> I may lose access to Emacs at work soon, so I'm probably going to have to learn some VBA to tweak MS Word .... :(
[21:49:16] <lisp123> So apaprently Norvig worked for Harlequin (LispWorks) for 2 years

[23:18:20] <lotuseater> i know that was the joke :D
[23:21:27] <lotuseater> pff i recorded a window with some simulation i made in mkv format, sent it to a friend who uses apple products and apple seems to not like it
[23:24:52] <lotuseater> hm maybe in the in the future we can combine polish notation with Feynman path integrals for a new powerful thing ...
[23:25:25] <pjb> vlc runs on macOS and iOS…
[23:25:48] <lotuseater> ok then he hasn't it running or tried it on his iPhone8
[23:26:44] <lotuseater> but i put it through ffmpeg to generate mp4s, so no worry
