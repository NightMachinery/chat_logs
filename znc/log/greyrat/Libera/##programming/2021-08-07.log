[00:00:41] <pyzozord> ok now a compiler question: afaik compiling has three main phases 1) converting text to tokens - tokenization (aka lexing) 2) converting tokens to abstract syntax tree (aka parsing) 3) converting ast to final code (aka code generation). How does the firs phase work? how do I convert char *codestring = "char *foo = \"bar\""; into a string tokens

[00:03:07] <pyzozord> so how would a token string look like in this case, would it be something like this? [char, *, foo, =, ", char, *, foo, =, \", bar, \", ", ;]
[00:04:05] <GeDaMo> Each token would have a designation like [("char", TYPE_ID), ("*", ASTERISK), ...
[00:04:37] <GeDaMo> Those become nodes in the AST
[00:04:40] <pyzozord> ah so it would already have some semantic understanding even on this early phase

[00:11:25] <pyzozord> need to read that PEG paper. I'm just trying to figure out what would be the absolute simples most oversimplified way of creating a compiler would be. Same like creating a register/stack machine can be done in literally just 5-10 lines of code
[00:11:28] <bjs> pyzozord: a PEG is just a kind of grammar,  just like the old ones people used to use except more streamlined for generating parsers from.  Something like gcc wasn't written 20 years ago and forgotten about
[00:11:34] <GeDaMo> pyzozord: Forth! :P
[00:11:58] <GeDaMo> The major difference with PEGs is that they specify an order
[00:12:21] <Izem> pyzozord recursive descent is the most straigtforward way to parse
[00:13:01] <bjs> recursive descent was the way I learned when I first started learning about compilers, and is a common way (even up to now) to hand-write parsers
[00:13:17] <GeDaMo> PEGs are a formalization of recursive descent
[00:13:39] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: will check out forth, I knew about, you mentioned it multiple times, but I never got around to check it out
[00:14:45] <bjs> PEGs aren't just recursive descent, as recursive descent parsers are more limited and often the "real" hand-written ones are also hand-hacked to do silly things to get around the limitations of LL(k) parsers
[00:15:06] <pyzozord> Izem: can you describe a very simple recurisve descent algorithm by steps?
[00:15:22] <Izem> sure, one moment
[00:15:50] <Izem> are you familiar with a programming language grammar?
[00:15:54] <GeDaMo> You can see a PEG as a program: each rule is a function which attempts to match literals and/or calls other rules to match
[00:16:07] <bjs> pyzozord: actually wikipedia is pretty good here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser and then the grammar (if writetn in LL form) basically tells you how to write the parser
[00:16:13] <pyzozord> Izem: I'm looking for tldr/teaser before I read the wiki page
[00:16:45] <Izem> on grammar, peg, or recursive descent?
[00:16:47] <pyzozord> Izem: just really most oversimplified birds eye view of what's going on in a sentence or two
[00:16:49] <bjs> pyzozord: just go straight to the wiki, and scroll down to the example
[00:17:11] <Izem> the wiki doesn't have the most friendly example
[00:17:41] <bjs> It has a perfectly fine example,  you can very clearly see a function for each non-terminal and inside each function an `if` for each of the productions
[00:18:15] <pyzozord> Actually that wiki page isn't that long, maybe I can manage it. Hopefully it's not too dense with cs terms
[00:18:54] <bjs> pyzozord: I think you'll quickly get a "feel" for recursive descent,  the exact mathematical description is not always easy to internalise
[00:19:13] <bjs> but you'll soon "get" what it's doing when you see how the examples of recursive descent parsers relate to their grammar
[00:19:35] <pyzozord> yeah that "get" is what I'm looking for
[00:20:14] <pyzozord> before I start reading, how does LL relates to recursive descent?
[00:20:34] <bjs> pyzozord: this is why I said it's better to get a feel before you jump into the mathematics of it
[00:20:59] *** Joins: alycidyne (~kova@91-160-172-214.subs.proxad.net)
[00:21:09] <bjs> pyzozord: take the example on the wiki page,  the grammar has a "condition" non-terminal, so I know the recursive-descent parser will have a "condition" function.  It's either "odd" followed by an expression or it's an expression followed by some stuff followed by some more stuff
[00:21:23] <Izem> pyzozord: recursive descent is a series of functions that benefit from a grammars recursive nature. basically each non terminal is a void function, and terminals you check for `if ch = '+' ...`, paired with a function called match that is taking input and checking if the current character from input matches the character in the grammar
[00:21:29] *** Quits: locknet (~locknet@static.193.168.itcsa.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:21:35] <bjs> pyzozord: go look at the "condition" function and you should see it basically... say the same stuff just in C, and it'll just say them in the same order they appeared in the grammar
[00:22:58] <bjs> pyzozord: so you can see it's recursing "down" into the grammar, by looking at the next symbol and then doing what the grammar says to do
[00:23:09] <Izem> LL grammars can be parsed with recursive descent
[00:23:19] <alycidyne> Hello, I just understood how the Amiga OCS worked, and I now wonder: why weren't devices able to fetch anywhere in memory? Seems kind of wasteful to have a chip solely for moving things around because the display controller can't fetch anywhere in memory
[00:23:55] <alycidyne> Same thing with the 640 KiB barrier and the 3 GB PCI memory hole... is the address generating circuitry that expensive?
[00:23:58] <bjs> pyzozord: and if you -then- go back and read the mathematical description you'll see why this corresponds to LL forms  (think about the cases where this approach might go wrong)
[00:25:06] <GeDaMo> alycidyne: the 640K barrier came about because the 8086 could only address 1MB and the upper 384K was reserved for devices / ROM
[00:26:24] <bjs> pyzozord: it's better to think about this as "recursive descent is the 'obvious' way to write a parser for a grammar, and LL(k) is the formal mathematical description of which kinds of grammars the parser 'works' for when you do it like this"
[00:27:07] <user51_> GeDaMo: man, 1mb must have been a lot back in the day
[00:27:10] <pyzozord> ok thanks both
[00:27:20] <GeDaMo> user51_: it was! :P
[00:27:49] <GeDaMo> A lot of early DOS software was ported from 8-bit micros which were usually limited to 64K memory total
[00:27:51] <user51_> i'm assuming it was a flat address space though
[00:27:59] <user51_> s/though/too
[00:28:01] <GeDaMo> No, it was segmented on the 8086
[00:28:35] <user51_> ah yes, 20 plus one secret bit? i wanted to do an 8086 emulator some time ago
[00:28:40] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: well, I'd say "segmented" with scare quotes

[00:29:22] <alycidyne> user51_: the 8086 shifts the "segment base" to the left by 4 bits, then adds that to the offset to give a 20-bit address
[00:29:32] <GeDaMo> user51_: addresses were (segment << 4) + address

[00:36:00] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: thanks

[00:38:15] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: so yes, you are correct about the 640 KB barrier, but the real question is putting the devices there. Sure, putting the ROM BIOS there makes sense, but don't devices expose some pointer register or something which makes fixed buffers redundant?

[01:00:31] <alycidyne> e.g. to write data to a file on disk, the write(2) syscall typically has to copy the data in the program's buffer to the disk's buffer. With zero-copy the disk would instead fetch data from the program's buffer directly

[01:54:19] <bjs> there may be many grammars that correspond to the same language
[01:54:26] <d3x0r> c is not context-free.. there's lots of places where what a thing becomes depends on where it's used
[01:55:12] <bjs> pyzozord: the grammar for C you'd find in the standard for example, will not be written in LL(1) style
[01:55:32] <node1> Just wondering if it is possible to append or add inside a file when the file is being stored as object on a cloud?
[01:55:35] <d3x0r> the preprocessor probably is
[01:56:03] <node1> Specially when cloud provider enabled a versioning on the file?
[01:56:07] <bjs> d3x0r: huh?  The syntax is fairly simple and is almost certainly a boring context-free one
[01:56:09] <d3x0r> node1  depends on the cloud's file api - might have to rewrite the whole thing
[01:56:25] <node1> How about in AWS s3 ?
[01:56:52] <d3x0r> struct { int a; } void f( int a ) { for( int b = 0; b < 0; b++ ) }  ... all those ints mean different things - result in different things
[01:57:07] <newpy> are things like chomsky hierarchies, grammars, etc, useful for architecture/design considerations?
[01:57:22] <newpy> or is it mostly for language/compiler design?
[01:57:30] <bjs> d3x0r: yeah?
[01:57:33] <node1> I have a bucket which has versioning enabled. And i would like to append specifically to the current version  without let it become as anther version.

[02:00:54] <node1> Any hack you know?
[02:01:27] <d3x0r> node1 ya no :) just rewrite the object... break the object into multiple objects ?

[02:02:00] <d3x0r> depends on what it is..
[02:02:23] <bjs> pyzozord: grammars that are actually LL(1) can be a bit ... weird, and they're often much easier to read/understand if they're not LL(1). Even if the language the two grammars accept are the same.  Obviously there are some languages that cannot be written using LL(1) grammars at all (e.g. ones that are ambiguous)

[02:17:32] <d3x0r> I'd expect the parse tree is just the tokens linked together, while syntax includes type information about the token

[02:20:34] <pyzozord> sounds like thie whole parsing debuckle cannot be reduced to as simple form as 10-20 lines of code
[02:20:55] <phogg> depends on what you're parsing and how serious you want to be about it
[02:20:56] <pyzozord> even for a very featureless language
[02:21:02] <bjs> pyzozord: the parse tree is the thing the parser gives you in the first instance (just a tree of tokens), the AST is a much more language-aware thing.  The parse tree will contain like "if" and parens and possibly whitespace and other cruft in just the way the parser happened to parse it. But the AST would just contain an "IfStatement" node

[02:23:59] <d3x0r> inclusing the syntax things like parens to group tokens simplifies generation  of AST
[02:24:23] <bjs> pyzozord: well the parse tree is the thing the parser gives you (although sure often you don't actually make a "real" data structure from it, it's just implicit in its control flow)
[02:24:39] <bjs> the AST is the thing you might actually "make" in the parser

[02:25:08] <pyzozord> I thought parser gives you the ast
[02:25:39] <vdamewood> The parser gives you a tree, depending on how it's written it could be a simple parse tree, or an AST.
[02:25:49] <pyzozord> I thought it goes like this: source text file -> tokenizer (aka lexer) -> 1d array of tokens -> parser -> ast -> code generation -> executable binary
[02:25:52] <bjs> pyzozord: well at the most basic level, forgetting asts entirely,  a parser is a program that given an input says "yes it parses" or "no it does not"
[02:26:32] <bjs> pyzozord: if it says yes, there *is* a parse tree associated with it.  Now the program probably doesn't *build* one, it's not like there's a "ParseTree" datatype in most cases (although yes, in some there is)
[02:27:00] <bjs> pyzozord: then when you want to add something to the end (e.g. a compiler) you make your parser have a side-effect of generating an AST as it goes

[02:28:29] <bjs> pyzozord: imagine you have "x + y + z", the language might denote an AST Node like `Add([x,y,z])` but the grammar was probably something like `ADD ::= <NAME> | <NAME> '+' ADD` so really it got parsed like `ADD(x, '+', ADD('z'))`

[02:33:24] <pyzozord> It seems like parse tree is some intermediate form between a string of tokens and abstract syntax tree
[02:33:31] <bjs> pyzozord: so think, the parser is a function like `String -> Option<AST>`. If the input parses, then you get an AST
[02:33:54] <bjs> pyzozord: but if you asked "why did it parse?", then a proof would be drawing its parse tree for you.
[02:34:12] <Izem> ast represents the parse tree
[02:34:51] <bjs> well the parse tree is from a specific parse that gave you that AST value so yes they're obviously related and represent the same thing
[02:35:16] <piou> pyzozord: the grammar is the set of rules that define how the text should be parsed. The parse tree is the order in which an actual parser parses stuff (and since there's recurrence etc it happens to be a tree). It's a concept, it doesn't exist in memory. The AST is an actual representation in memory of the parsed tree.
[02:35:18] <bjs> but the point is, I could've changed my grammar to say `ADD ::= NAME | ADD "+" NAME` and now my *parse trees* look different (they have ADDs on the left-hand side) but my AST is the same.
[02:35:33] <pyzozord> oh I think I get it better if the pictures from this answer are accurate https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5967888/whats-the-difference-between-parse-trees-and-abstract-syntax-trees/10177369#10177369

[03:49:26] <vdamewood> phogg inky: IRC has a formal specification: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459
[03:49:26] <phogg> inky: the RFCs are not nearly complete
[03:49:54] <phogg> every implementation has extensions, sometimes a lot of them, and the implementations drive new features
[03:49:55] <inky> can i join the room on freenode with the account on libera? or chat to freenode user?

[03:50:16] *** Joins: rany (~rany@user/rany)
[03:50:28] <phogg> with IRC the servers must agree to peer with each other to form a network, then you can communicate within that network
[03:50:33] <inky> how is it decentralized then?
[03:50:40] <phogg> it was supposed to be one big network, but then eris
[03:50:45] *** Joins: CodeSpelunker (~CodeSpelu@user/codespelunker)
[03:50:56] <inky> is it because libera and/or freenode closed decentralization?
[03:50:59] <phogg> inky: each server is entirely independent of the others, and no one of them is more the center
[03:51:00] <oldlaptop> Even a relatively centrally-managed network like libera is spread across lots of servers, dozens even.
[03:51:36] <inky> well facebook also spread acrosszlots of servers
[03:51:37] <beaky> nice i like libera
[03:51:45] <phogg> inky: facebook severs are all run by facebook
[03:51:47] <oldlaptop> Some networks, such as efnet, are much more decentralized, and different servers have different rules about how many concurrent clients you can have, whether they want you running bots, etc.
[03:51:50] <inky> i cannot chat from facebook to google.
[03:52:05] <vdamewood> facebook isn't a protocol. iRC is a protocol.
[03:52:12] <phogg> inky: if you wanted to run an IRC daemon and join it with libera you probably could, as long as you agreed to abide by the network rules
[03:52:15] <inky> sure
[03:52:44] <vdamewood> So a comparison between Facebook and IRC is apple and oranges.
[03:52:45] <inky> ok i see how irc defines decentralization
[03:52:51] <phogg> most IRC networks are a federation of independent operators
[03:53:24] <phogg> again, IRC was not originally intended to have multiple networks. It's more an accident of history that makes it this way
[03:53:27] *** Quits: Guest2029 (~ghost64@corrigan.xyz) (Quit: See you!)
[03:53:48] <phogg> you could also set up an isolated federation of XMPP servers that talk to each other but not the big one most people use
[03:53:49] <inky> well two are similar in that they use many servers without allowing communication outide of their domain.
[03:53:54] <phogg> many corporations do that, for internal communication
[03:54:40] <phogg> inky: the two things are not really comparable
[03:54:46] <inky> facebook and google and whatsapp were using xmpp, but only google allowed communication with people from other servers.

[04:06:26] <inky> other question: how does irc authorize a user: does it have  a central user db (sort of nis/ldap/passwd) or it yncs uer information across the servers? er ech server has its users(i guess no).
[04:08:00] <Arahael> inky: It doesn't, as such, but irc networks often add an ad-hoc hack where identified users can authenticate with privilaged person called 'nickserv'.

[04:08:43] <Arahael> inky: And yes, that user has a central user database, and given their privilaged status in the network, also works with the IRC network to give the user a +i flag.
[04:09:15] <inky> Arahel: i believe google and whatsapp were (or whaapp may be continues to be at core) xmpp. it was possible not only to connect to gtalk with any xmpp client and write to people from other xmpp servers, but also to see the devices/resources people were connecting from and route your message to the specific device.
[04:09:24] <Arahael> inky: IRCv3 might specify this more clearly, though.  My understanding of the core low level protocol is a little dated.

[04:10:16] <inky> Arahel, thank you, now i see.
[04:10:47] <Arahael> inky: Maybe google and whatsapp use xmpp internally but frankly I wouldn't make that assumption.  As a key example, facebook chat used to expose a buggy gateway for xmpp that you used to be able to use an xmpp client to connect to and may have even been federated at some point...  But they took that down.

[04:12:31] <inky> routing the message to the specific device is an old xmpp feature and gtalk upported that if you were connecting with client like psi

[04:14:28] <Arahael> inky: Anyway, large companies routinely implement their software stack and protcols from scratch, it's often easier, depending on how it fits with their software development methodology.  If it's strictly done from business requirements first, then naturally the software becomes written from scratch that way.
[04:14:43] <inky> i am confident i was chatting with google users by using own xmpp server - i was naively bringing people to google  in order to be able to chat with them by using xmpp.

[15:15:11] <Arahael> GeDaMo: Yeah, I noticed the library's search doesn't show it. :(  And that particular wikitree appears inconsistent with most sources.

[15:16:35] <Arahael> GeDaMo: Yeah, that's a relevant, but quite different book.
[15:17:00] <Arahael> GeDaMo: The specific thing I'm trying to find is whether Alesta is infact Alan's *second* wife.
[15:17:09] <Arahael> (And I think it's in the book I'm trying to find)
[15:17:34] <Arahael> Most internet sources seem to suggest that Alan's first wife is Eva, second wife is Alestra, but I'm actually suspecting that those are the same woman.
[15:18:31] <Arahael> mrig: Incidentially, my parents plans before Covid 19 came was indeed to visit England, specifically Dufftown.

[15:33:25] <GeDaMo> Not available online unfortunately
[15:34:00] <Arahael> Ok, curious - it does seem to suggest that Alan may have married "Margaret", not Alesta, but it's hard to be sure as the page is almost illegible.

[23:46:35] <olle> Separate into different classes, function, types, modules, even machines or processes (Erlang, e.g.)

[23:46:42] <dodo> yup
[23:47:08] <olle> Maybe before defining "separation" one should define "communication between parts"?

[23:47:32] <dodo> are you looking for a formal definition?
[23:47:33] <olle> Well, the one goes with the other
[23:47:41] <olle> dodo: Dunno, just brainfarting
[23:47:49] <dodo> fair enough :D

[23:50:28] <olle> For "concern", people usually mean IO, calculation, organization (glue code).
[23:50:56] <olle> Hm
[23:51:18] <olle> I just read that the more files you touch in a change, the higher the fault prediction is
[23:51:46] <olle> So maybe rather than separation, one should ask "what changes together?"

[23:59:47] <mrig> the etymology of the word concern is interesting here, it does also specify that which you are suggesting.
