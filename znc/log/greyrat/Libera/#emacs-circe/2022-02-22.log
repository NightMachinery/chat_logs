[17:51:31] <bookdoorstop> hello! I've been trying to setup sasl-password on circe through the doom emacs module. My idea is to get the password through a shell command, however it seems like I'm doing something wrong
[17:51:36] <bookdoorstop> https://paste.sr.ht/~glorifiedgluer/2f5a43b1c65c6e471ea59fa0b0e9ef0695723807
[17:52:53] <bookdoorstop> This is my current approach but I feel that my functions aren't being run at evaluation-time or something like that...
[17:55:03] <wasamasa> this cannot work
[17:55:25] <wasamasa> sasl-password may be a function
[17:56:20] <wasamasa> or a string
[17:56:28] <wasamasa> the other two settings must be strings
[17:56:37] <wasamasa> you're using backquote, so the values are actually lists
[17:57:43] <wasamasa> so you'd need to unquote by prepending them with a comma
[17:58:28] <wasamasa> consider though that since this is lisp (as opposed to haskell or such), this will be eagerly evaluated, so the rbw program will be run on startup once
[17:59:40] <bookdoorstop> hm... I see
[18:00:43] <wasamasa> I dunno why the set-irc-server! macro takes a list
[18:00:49] <wasamasa> or function
[18:01:16] <bookdoorstop> I'm kind of new to elisp as I mostly use emacs to read emails/take notes
[18:01:20] <wasamasa> is that a doom thing?
[18:01:24] <bookdoorstop> yes!
[18:01:28] <wasamasa> ok
[18:01:38] <wasamasa> and what is rbw?
[18:01:47] <bookdoorstop> a bitwaden CLI client
[18:01:53] <bookdoorstop> bitwarden, sorry
[18:01:53] <wasamasa> aha
[18:02:10] <wasamasa> I don't know how it's output looks, but if you feel like not shelling out
[18:02:22] <wasamasa> you could use `process-lines' and some list/string processing instead of awk :D
[18:03:47] <bookdoorstop> I'll into that, didn't know about this function hehe
[18:03:51] <bookdoorstop> I'll look *
[18:04:33] <bookdoorstop> so what you were previously saying is that my code is not evaluated?
[18:04:39] <wasamasa> yes
[18:04:47] <wasamasa> quote and backquote tell to not evaluate the argument
[18:04:56] <wasamasa> backquote allows to selectively evaluate parts of it
[18:05:06] <wasamasa> this can be used to construct complex lists, kind of like a template
[18:05:52] <bookdoorstop> hmm I see, so putting those values into their variables and "calling" them inside a list should work, right?
[18:06:17] <wasamasa> all you need is to prepend whatever you want evaluated with a comma
[18:06:43] <wasamasa> `(foo bar ,(intern "baz"))
[18:07:59] <bookdoorstop> wow I can't believe it was that easy to fix this issue!
[18:08:19] <bookdoorstop> wasamasa: thank you so much for the help! (sent from circe btw haha)
[18:08:24] <wasamasa> you're welcome
[18:08:53] <bookdoorstop> I guess it's time to learn some elisp for great good ;-)
[18:10:57] <bookdoorstop> does circe support fetching the history automatically from my bouncer?
[18:11:08] <bookdoorstop> couldn't find this on the documentation
[18:11:43] <wasamasa> no
[18:11:56] <bookdoorstop> oh, I see, thank you
[18:11:57] <wasamasa> it has just enough ircv3 support for SASL to work
[18:11:58] <wasamasa> that's it
[18:12:09] <wasamasa> oh and someone added certificate authentication support
[18:14:36] <bookdoorstop> that's nice, I really like the module on doom-emacs
[18:14:48] <bookdoorstop> although I can fetch the chathistory through a command here
