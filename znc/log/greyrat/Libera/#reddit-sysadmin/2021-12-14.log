[10:34:30] <DrZak> you generally dont measure fluids in grams :D

[10:35:28] <yuken> DrZak, no need for that if I have an accurate enough scale, I can pour it directly into my solids.
[10:35:42] <yuken> and then it'll be evenly dispersed through the cake batter.
[10:36:00] <SirSantalot> that seems like such a hassle. I'll just stick to regular steak and beers
[10:36:24] <SirSantalot> but you enjoy yourself yuken
[10:36:28] <SirSantalot> what's the job btw?
[10:36:37] <yuken> SirSantalot, it's much better than alcohol imho. Less addcitive (although still habit/dependency forming), much more enjoyable... time in general. 
[10:36:39] <yuken> Lowes, hardware store.
[10:36:57] <yuken> I also get a discount, 10% and 20% during holidays SirSantalot - which is good because, uh, I do stuff that could use hardware store items :P
[10:37:21] <SirSantalot> lol
[10:37:57] <SirSantalot> kind of insane how "famous" the USA is that I actually know that chain of hardware store
[10:38:26] <csws> tbh confused me at first because lowes is a place to buy pants here lol
[10:38:27] <SirSantalot> I'm pretty sure you've never heard of the Hubo or Gamma stores we have :p
[10:38:44] <yuken> Only stores outside of the US (or originated outside) I'm aware of is...
[10:38:48] <csws> https://www.lowes.com.au/
[10:38:50] <yuken> Lidl, Aldi, Tesco, Bunnings
[10:39:06] <SirSantalot> huh, I don't even know those last 2
[10:39:07] <csws> lol bunnings
[10:39:12] <csws> bunnings is a hardware store here
[10:39:15] <yuken> ik that csws 
[10:39:17] <yuken> oh wait
[10:39:17] <csws> tesco is a supermarket in england
[10:39:45] <csws> they've got aldis here too now
[10:39:48] <csws> we're moving up in the world
[10:39:52] <yuken> Aldi is a thing in the US too.
[10:39:58] <csws> we've got IGA here too
[10:40:01] <csws> but they've been here for ages
[10:40:09] <yuken> pog.
[10:40:15] <csws> randomly I hear about woolworths in the US but looks like it might be dead?
[10:40:16] <SirSantalot> huh, didn't know you guys had aldi too
[10:40:19] <csws> and I'm not sure it's even the same place as here
[10:40:33] <csws> SirSantalot, aldi is going for world domination
[10:40:35] <csws> ... god damn germans
[10:40:37] <csws> they won't ever stop
[10:40:38] <SirSantalot> :p
[10:40:39] <yuken> K-Mart is also dead in the US csws 
[10:40:42] <yuken> except it seems huge in straya
[10:40:42] <SirSantalot> they just got clever about it
[10:40:44] <csws> kmart still alive here!
[10:40:48] <csws> yeah it is
[10:40:55] <csws> I can't remember if target is subsuming them or vice versa tbh
[10:40:59] <csws> but it's all wesfarmers I think anyway?>
[10:41:04] <csws> they used to own coles but divested it I think
[10:41:11] <yuken> SirSantalot, https://i.imgur.com/jwerAkE.jpg
[10:41:16] <yuken> this is the kind of steak I'll be going for.
[10:41:18] <yuken> Maybe a bit bigger.
[10:41:27] <csws> not bad
[10:41:30] <yuken> I think that should be around $15-20.
[10:41:42] <csws> I miss the canadian steaks tbh
[10:41:44] <csws> the shit you get here suuucks
[10:41:46] <yuken> for 700g.
[10:42:13] <csws> at least the potato situation finally improved
[10:42:23] <csws> potato board got nuked
[10:42:42] <yuken> csws, when I eat this steak, I will be 2% steak.
[10:42:50] <yuken> I weigh 50kg!
[10:42:51] <csws> are you a stick figure?
[10:42:53] <csws> JFC

[10:43:43] <csws> wow 18.6 BMI
[10:43:45] <csws> so close to underweight
[10:44:28] <yuken> csws, I'm going to be gaining weight but trying to lose apparent weight - IE. more muscle mass, less fat.
[10:44:57] <csws> I'm just plugging away at weight loss
[10:44:59] <yuken> so just a lot more walking and lifting, more muscle in legs and arms
[10:45:01] <yuken> flatter stomach.
[10:45:25] <csws> I'm 175 cm so still overweight but far better than where I started
[10:45:29] <yuken> csws, not that I have a belly in the first place, but nota s flat as I want when viewd from the side: https://i.imgur.com/yF4gn5t.jpg

[10:46:54] <SirSantalot> because seeing a man with bare abdomen and t-shirt over his face is a funny sight yuken 
[10:47:10] <yuken> rude, SirSantalot.
[10:47:35] <csws> yuken, do you shave
[10:47:45] <SirSantalot> and then you call me rude :p

[14:13:43] <teh_Gr1nch> why open ticket then
[14:13:45] <teh_Gr1nch> ?
[14:15:03] <Activ8> usually the ticket gets opened before they go on holiday but don't tell you they are on holiday until you contact them
[14:15:04] <Activ8> lol

[15:02:42] <SirSantalot> good news everyone
[15:02:46] <SirSantalot> I have not died
[15:02:59] <Activ8> peekaboo
[15:03:09] <SirSantalot> I did, however, attend a funeral of a colleague that did
[15:03:23] <Activ8> aw rip
[15:05:10] <SirSantalot> <lancehead> SirSantalot went speeding while drunk in his sled, hit a young child in the head with a present at mach 4, and was executed for his crimes
[15:05:16] <SirSantalot> lol, how do you come up with that shit
[15:05:48] <SirSantalot> yuken, congrats on acing that super difficult job interview
[15:05:52] <Activ8> that's what you call an active imagination
[15:06:11] <SirSantalot> quite so
[15:06:30] <SirSantalot> this is pretty obvious, but funerals suck
[15:07:44] <yuken> SirSantalot, wat
[15:07:49] <yuken> SirSantalot, it doesn't happen for 3 more hours
[15:07:51] <yuken> you dumb fish.
[15:08:12] <SirSantalot> well I'm sure you're going to ace it
[15:08:22] <teh_Gr1nch> Activ8, ticket at 8:20 this morning: "URGENT! Can't open your software *phone photo of DB connection error attached*" reply from us at 9:02: "No issues detected with the platform. Can you please confirm if this is all across the entire office or just 1 machine?" -- Still no reply. URGENT, sure
[15:08:22] <SirSantalot> I just want to be the first to congratulate you
[15:08:41] <Activ8> teh_Gr1nch always the case lol
[15:09:01] <Activ8> any ticket with urgent in the field goes down on my priority
[15:09:18] <teh_Gr1nch> we only had 3 open tickets this morning
[15:09:28] <Activ8> I don't like it when a user tags their own tickets are urgent when it's not
[15:09:29] <teh_Gr1nch> that was the last replied to  :D
[15:09:35] <Activ8> I have had 2 tickets opened this morning both done
[15:10:12] <teh_Gr1nch> I meant 3 open tickets before start of day
[15:10:22] <teh_Gr1nch> we've had 9 more this morning already
[15:10:39] <teh_Gr1nch> and some replies to ongoing ones
[15:10:48] <yuken> SirSantalot, despite seeming retarded on IRC I actually have good charisma and hold well in conversations
[15:10:50] <yuken> so hopefully I do.
[15:10:56] <teh_Gr1nch> december is busy ish
[15:11:14] <teh_Gr1nch> normally that's a day's worth
[15:12:31] <teh_Gr1nch> I need to figure out how to link our IVR to the ticketing system to request the open ticket#. no ticket, no human
[15:14:13] <Activ8> december is never busy people stop responding to stuff unless it's really urgent
[15:15:28] <teh_Gr1nch> it's the opposite for us since a lot of people want to resolve issues / add new stuff before year end to "start fresh" in the new year
[15:15:52] <teh_Gr1nch> and of course they wait 'til the very end - December
[15:16:30] <teh_Gr1nch> last week alone, I had 4 database migrations

[18:26:21] <Santax> As big as Capone but not as well known because cincy is a smaller city
[18:26:21] <SirSantalot> some famous scientist
[18:26:36] <SirSantalot> got mad, slammed his cane down on the floor. Sadly his foot was between the cane and the floor

[18:30:08] <SirSantalot> there was this one doctor who performed an amputation of a mans leg. That single surgery had a 300% mortality rate

[18:30:49] <SirSantalot> back then, amputation needed to be done super fast to minimize the literall torture they were performing, and minimize shock and stuff
[18:31:02] <SirSantalot> so he hurried too much, and cut right through his assistants fingers
[18:31:06] <Santax> imagine when they didn't have ether or another way to put you out
[18:31:09] <Santax> here bite this stick
[18:31:34] <SirSantalot> the patient died, the assistant died, and a member of the audience (which they then had) died of a heart attack from the brutality of it all
[18:31:41] <SirSantalot> hence, 300% mortality rate

[19:07:21] <Activ8> it's release candidate stage but people have this deployed over thousands of systems and live
[19:08:05] <int0x1C8> you can attach the MDF to an existing SQL server with SSMS
