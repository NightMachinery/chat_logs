[08:29:49] <gry> Samian: we have work from home mode for last few weeks
[08:29:59] <gry> Samian: so my family members, when i work from home in the same room, drive me insane
[08:30:13] <gry> Samian: they start whining, yelling, expecting i am ready to chat any time, etc
[08:30:35] <Samian> oh yeah I can totally see that
[08:30:44] <gry> Samian: some people dont know what they are doing - so if you want good environment, make sure people discipline their brains and dont act unconsciously
[08:31:25] <gry> Samian: if people around you are smart, then you can work in any environment, even if they're sitting on top of your shoulders (smart people can do it gently; stupid people will annoy you even if they're 50 meters away)
[08:32:07] <gry> Samian: that said, i also prefer to wake up at around 5am, go to bed no later than 9pm
[08:32:20] <gry> Samian: and surround myself with a few plants that i water every day, they give inspiration
[08:33:04] <Samian> gry then you're internal clock is likely shorter than 24 hours
[08:33:15] <Samian> I read night owls' internal clocks are generally longer than 24 hours
[08:33:29] <Samian> longer than 24 hour clock == night person. Shorter than 24 hour clock == morning person
[08:33:36] <Samian> look it up and see for yourself
[08:33:51] <gry> Samian: i have a strong belief that everyone is a morning person, they just don't know it
[08:34:10] <gry> Samian: all night persons who tried being morning persons for a few weeks - they did not go back
[08:34:18] <gry> Samian: at least the few whom i convinced to try
[08:34:45] <Samian> gry  it's too time consuming to find out. I can't hire someone to follow me around gathering statistics of my performance and moon and seeing where I was and what correlated with what.
[08:34:53] <Samian> and to have the person track me for 3 hours.
[08:35:09] <Samian> And then go back in time and tack me in another environment. And then compare the data to see which environment I performed better in
[08:35:17] <Samian> *track
[08:35:43] <Samian> gry  isn't that the only way to really know which environment one performs better in?
[08:35:48] <Samian> Isn't that the scientific method?
[08:36:16] <Samian> generate the data and compare the data? But by the time you have the data, it's too late to act on it

[08:40:46] <gry> i think instead of stats you can just pause a few times a day and check what you were thinking of
[08:41:16] <gry> if your thoughts are "I want to sleep" or "I am procrastrinating" or "this specific distraction is on again", then it is not good
[08:41:29] <gry> on the other side if you find you're able to focus in long blocks of time, then it's progress
[08:41:31] <Samian> gry  notice I mentioning hiring another person in my hypothetical study
[08:42:03] <gry> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique I find this technique useful
[08:42:03] <ro-bot-o> [url] Pomodoro Technique - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[08:42:10] <Samian> if your thoughts are "I want to sleep" or "I am procrastrinating" or "this specific distraction is on again", then it is not good <----- this is exactly how I feel during daylight time
[08:42:25] <Samian> at 10pm to 6am I want to work. I feel relaxed. I'm in the zone
[08:42:25] <gry> if you see you've started doing a task and 5 mins later someone asks you to go to a shed to fetch some tool - probably not a good environment
[08:42:54] <Samian> screw this. I'm switching to night time. I'm going to work until 6am
[08:43:09] <Samian> gry  thanks for the chat!
[08:43:09] <gry> this is how I personally got rid of these thoughts, I implemented it by writing 16 tasks for my 8 hour day in the morning, then ensuring each 9:00, 9:20, 9:50, etc times I am on track

[08:43:42] <gry> hi mr/ms amigojapan on the irccloud logbot
[08:44:16] <Samian> gry  the issue with your method is that you're discounting that maybe one's current preferences are due to bad habits being formed.  Maybe in the short term doing things differently feels more difficult, but in the long term it will become habit and be better overall
[08:44:24] <Samian> gry  that's the what-if that always exists in my ind

[08:45:19] <Samian> gry  remember learning to type? Remember thinking "I'll never learn to type" but slowly and surely you pick it up.

[08:45:30] <Samian> aaaaa ffffff ggggg hhhhh
[08:45:33] <Samian> remember those exercises?
[08:45:52] <gry> with learning - helps if you have a peer to watch, then together with them (they type 9 letters and you type 1) then gradually increase your participation
[08:46:07] <gry> i didnt have such exercises, i just spent 1h/week in front of a computer, so i typed when i wanted
[08:46:11] <gry> it jus sank in by itself
[08:46:17] <gry> just
[08:46:27] <Samian> when I try making working during the day a habit, I fail and think to myself "if I had stuck to working at night I would have gotten more done"
[08:46:43] <gry> so i wouldn't recommend to switch from night to day
[08:46:48] <amigojapan> Hi gry
[08:46:54] <gry> it is a very big change, it will probably cause a headache straight away
[08:46:54] <Samian> so breaking the habit of working all night fails. And I'm *less* productive because I couldn't work during the day
[08:46:57] <gry> hello amigojapan!
[08:47:20] <gry> Samian, i'd suggest shifting it by 10 mins every day, then maybe you get there eventually if this is your goal
