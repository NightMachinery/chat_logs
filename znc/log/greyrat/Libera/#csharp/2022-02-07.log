[00:00:00] <MichaelLong> yes
[00:00:04] <BtbN> ???
[00:00:12] <BtbN> GPUs have audio controllers, due to HDMI. But not USB
[00:00:18] <MichaelLong> I hope the next AMD gpus will still have and additional USB controller
[00:00:44] <BtbN> Only GPUs which had USB were some odd Nvidia ones, where they had some USB-C VR-Port. But they got rid of that the same gen
[00:01:12] <MichaelLong> so it is a yes?
[00:01:30] <BtbN> It's like two or three GPUs, which are not being built anymore, that ever had it
[00:01:41] * lz_ is happy he sold his 3d vision shit before it was obvious this wasn't going to be a thing
[00:02:29] <BtbN> The amount of work, efforts and maintenance a setup like that needs is just not worth it.
[00:02:41] <BtbN> The special mainboards and CPUs you need also make it so expensive that you can just... buy a second PC
[00:03:01] <lz_> BtbN: I disagree. It's worth it if it gets rid of a bunch of software you don't trust, such as epic shit
[00:03:14] <BtbN> Just don't use Software you don't trust. Easy.
[00:03:28] <lz_> ?? lol
[00:03:31] <MichaelLong> for me my gaming in VM must like using a console, I just turn it on, play for a while and shut it down.

[00:04:06] <lz_> no, I'll depoison it. turns out I use it because I need it

[00:04:35] <lz_> what pro help do I need?
[00:04:58] <BtbN> That makes even less sense. So you hate Epic with a passion, yet make games for it? What?

[00:10:04] <MatthiasVance> Can I already preorder?
[00:10:08] <lz_> MatthiasVance: yeah I'll definitely ship on steam, probably not epic store
[00:10:15] <lz_> MatthiasVance: lol

[00:11:33] <lz_> I remember I had plans to ship it on iOS. started the port, gave up in the middle. I'm glad I stopped before spending too much time on it for nothing

[02:44:17] <lz_> maybe all timelines actually suck and that's a statistical thing
[02:45:14] <lz_> with only one datapoint it's safe to assume most of them do
[02:46:01] <Suchiman> lz_: it depends, if there's infinite timeline then there's an infinite amount of dumb timeline and an infinite amount of awesome timelines
[02:46:34] <Suchiman> lz_: even one where hitler cured cancer
[02:47:34] <lz_> Suchiman: i dunno, can't you say sth like half of integers are odd and half are even? infinite sets are weird so I don't know
[02:48:02] <lz_> still it's not a good look for what your average timeline looks like
[02:48:30] <Suchiman> lz_: there's no such thing as half of infinite, it basically works like NaN, once you touch infinity, it all ends up infinity
[02:48:46] <lz_> Suchiman: ok but if you pick a random integer, there's still half a chance it's odd or even
[02:49:16] <Suchiman> lz_: yeah but if there's infinite amount of integers then there's also infinite amount of odd and even integers
[02:51:46] *** Quits: Kog (~Kog@about/csharp/kog) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:51:53] <lz_> Suchiman: but we still can reason in terms of probabilities even on infinite set I think. So either most timelines suck, or I'm very unlucky
[02:53:21] <Suchiman> lz_: but the real question is, does an infinite set contain itself?
[02:53:38] <lz_> Suchiman: depends on which infinite set
[02:53:53] <lz_> wait
[02:55:07] <lz_> Suchiman: maybe the set of all sets that don't contain themselves
[02:56:29] <lz_> Suchiman: I'm not sure I understood the question but if you take the set of all integers, they don't start repeating after a while
[02:59:00] <lz_> yeah I googled your question and the answer seems to be no. only some sets contain themselves like the set of all sets
[03:00:21] <lz_> maybe they don't exist at all https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_set#Reasons_for_nonexistence
[03:01:44] <lz_> anyway that doesn't tell me how to hop out of this timeline
[03:03:50] <teegee> ahh! how can one part of my partial class be static and the other one not?
[03:04:17] <lz_> teegee: just make the class non static? you can still have static members afaik
[03:04:56] <teegee> I know I can. THat's what I had but then my linter complained
[03:05:19] <lz_> it would probably stop complaining as soon as you add non static things
[03:05:38] <teegee> I just didn't think it was legal to do
[03:11:42] <Suchiman> teegee: things like static or visibility modifiers like public only need to be specified on one part but count for alll
[03:12:01] <Suchiman> including Attributes
[03:12:08] <_genuser_> annoying surveys about salary information.
[03:12:17] <_genuser_> why do people think everybody has a right to know everybody's salary?
[03:12:54] <teegee> hmmm
[03:13:09] <lz_> _genuser_: where i live most people don't tell how much they earn, but I think that if everyone was open about it 1/ things would probably be more fair 2/ salaries would be higher
[03:14:20] <_genuser_> lz_ I can honestly see the point of view. But I don't believe that would be the end result. Employers would simply pass over people who demand more than their budget would allow. And ultimately hire someone who agrees to that number.
[03:14:22] <lz_> I remember my shock when I realized that my 1st job was paid as much as a telemarketing operator
[03:14:51] <lz_> almost as soon as I realized it, I said I quit, and got a 25% raise offer
[03:15:34] <_genuser_> in the end if you have a budget of 150k USD for an architect position, but the person being interviewed says they need 170k and the employer can't find that extra 20k, they'll say sorry we can't meet that number. And even thought existing architects are making 170k, the employer needs one more and doesn't have the budget. They'll keep looking until
[03:15:35] <_genuser_> they find someone.
[03:15:41] <lz_> I started looking for other jobs; sent 1 application, got 1 interview, immediately accepted
[03:16:08] <lz_> (I ended up accepting the raise offer though)
[03:16:35] <_genuser_> fair is a new concept which overshadows just. And people now believe (especially twitter generation) that anything they want is fair and if they can call it fair, it must be done for them.
[03:16:36] <Suchiman> _genuser_: it's more like "hey, person A does the same thing as me yet he gets twice as much for it, why's that?"
[03:16:40] <lz_> by "immediately accepted" I mean I was proposed the job after the interview
[03:16:50] <_genuser_> lz_ hehe, I knew what you mean.
[03:17:11] <Suchiman> _genuser_: and that's why they don't want you talking about your salary
[03:17:17] <Suchiman> so they can keep paying you as little as they can get away with
[03:17:30] <lz_> today I know I'm paid utter shit but lost all my confidence so I'm not looking elsewhere
[03:17:32] <_genuser_> Suchiman many reasons. Maybe person A was there when the going was rough. They earned their salary for various reasons. That doesn't mean everybody with that title going forward deserves that much.
[03:18:01] <Suchiman> _genuser_: that does not make sense in my book, equal work should have equal compensation
[03:18:13] <_genuser_> lz_ that sucks. You gotta start interviewing. My skills were and still are pretty low on technical scale. But since I've been interviewing I have at least learned what the employers are looking for. It helps me to try to learn those things.
[03:18:14] <lz_> that's one of the reasons I hate unreal engine so much. At the time the license was like 1 million dollar, and I was paid the bare minimum to work with this shit
[03:19:03] <lz_> it's like I was doing work but the money was going to epic instead of me
[03:19:25] <_genuser_> Suchiman equal work, true. To an extent. The employee 1 just might mean more to the employer. "You stuck with me when the days were rough and I couldn't pay you anything and still did architect level work, now that the company is established, I'll pay you a good salary so you stay and enjoy the benefit of the loyalty." That doesn't equate to
[03:19:25] <_genuser_> "everybody who gets hired at architect level position went through the same experience"
[03:19:39] <ben> lz_: "boss makes a dollar, i make a dime"
[03:20:42] <_genuser_> Suchiman but let's say google that's well established now, hires person A at salary X and then hired person B at salary X - Y, then I think that's where I'd agree, equal work should get equal pay.
[03:20:51] <lz_> ben: the thing I learned at the time is, people weren't paid according to how capable they were, it only depended on how much they asked for it. Some people ask a lot, others don't
[03:21:24] <Suchiman> _genuser_: okay, but how would you know that you're not equally paid if you don't know what anybody earns
[03:21:37] <_genuser_> lz_ that's another unfortunate side of things. Everybody wants to save money. If you have a budget of X for a car and the salesperson asks for less, you'll save the extra money and take the lower offer.
[03:21:37] <Suchiman> _genuser_: also there should be goalposts "if you wanna earn X then you gotta do Y"
[03:22:17] <lz_> _genuser_: so my point still stands. knowing what everybody ears would help make things more fair
[03:22:21] <lz_> earns*
[03:22:50] <_genuser_> Suchiman agree with goalposts. For the first question - it would also be impractical for the company to explain and justify one employee to another. But knowing the difference would build resentment until the second employee (paid less) leaves and then teh employee is looking for another employee (still at the same lower level, due to whatever
[03:22:50] <Suchiman> _genuser_: if you have clear goalposts what work brings which compensation, then there does not need to be any envy or questioning why X earns Y, because X does Y
[03:22:50] <_genuser_> reasons for lower budget).
[03:23:45] <_genuser_> Suchiman disagree with last statement. People are emotional. One will always think they do so much more for the employer than another person. Emotional thinking when your own reward is involved will never be unbiased.
[03:25:01] <lz_> _genuser_: it would help filter our resentful people then, that's just a bonus
[03:25:41] <_genuser_> lz_ hehe, at least you find a benefit out of it!

[03:31:25] <_genuser_> siteground offer 3/mo initially then next year I think it goes to 12-15/mo. stupid.

[06:57:33] <ASUS> the codebase I work on is .NET Framework, not .NET Core.
[06:57:36] <ASUS> Should I be scared?
[07:06:46] <phrosty> Framework is still pretty tolerable for me, though some of the APIs in Core are very useful so you do miss them.
[07:07:12] <edcba> why don't you migrated to .net 6 yet ?
[07:09:21] <MatthiasVance> Anyone scheduling tweets? I know there is a built in way but I would want a tool where I just enter the tweet and select a day I don't want to worry/care about the time
[07:09:22] <ASUS> lots of code
[07:09:36] <ASUS> lots of testing
[07:09:40] <ASUS> lots of work
[07:17:18] <bkool> ASUS, I work in both .net framework and .net core in my job. there is stuff I like about .net framework mainly it was just familiar/easy to access certain APIs. but I'm liking .net core because of the structure it forces. Although in .net core there's a lot of initial scaffolding magic/complexity that can be frustrating for a newcomer. i was certainly frustrated some at first.
[07:17:38] <ASUS> ok
[07:18:10] <bkool> .net core is definitely the future. so hopefully some plan to use .net core at some level. all our greenfield projects are in .net core.
[07:18:24] <bkool> we can't migrate some applications (WebForms) to .net core.
[07:19:07] <bkool> and some .net framework mvc may be tricky to migrate but may or may not be worth it?
[07:22:34] <ASUS> wait
[07:22:41] <ASUS> there are three .NETs?
[07:22:57] <ASUS> .NET framework, .NET core and .NET Framework mvc?
[07:28:05] <bkool> just 2.
[07:28:29] <bkool> .net framework mvc and .net framework webforms are just application types using the .net framework
[07:28:51] <bkool> similar to how you have .net core web api or .net core mvc, .net core with razor pages.

[07:39:00] <MatthiasVance> Yes!
[07:42:19] <bkool> and i get the .net naming changes but they should have done that from the start!! .net framework could still get 4.8.x.x 4.9.x until forever. and anything .NET 5+ is the new .net
[07:43:19] <bkool> but they had to confuse people outside of the c#/.net community who were interested in the new multi-platform .net for years.

[09:12:42] <bkool> plus i do prefer a gui for it.
[09:12:56] <_genuser_> hehe, I use a gui too sometimes. I use gitextensions for complicated stuff.
[09:13:01] <_genuser_> and just the cli for everyday stuff.
[09:13:24] <bkool> just installed gitfiend to give it a try. we'll see how it goes.
[09:13:47] <_genuser_> especially if you just want to checkout another branch or another commit and just see what the file is like, it's so easy to load it in git extensions, and click on teh branch and the commit, then file explorer, all without switching actual branches.
[09:14:03] <_genuser_> but even rollbacks, etc. etc. super easy.
[09:14:14] <bkool> I'll have to check it out!

[10:03:35] <ravindUwU> How is the instance size calculated?
[10:12:08] <peterR``> I would say a class should be your default choice since the semantics of struct are different

[13:08:04] <Suchiman> Cecen: try the SustainedLowLatency setting, that should help
[13:08:21] <Cecen> I have a large piece of data that churns regularly, but I can guarantee nothing is referencing it at a certain point. I'll see if that helps enough

[13:11:24] <MatthiasVance> Stop drinking energy drinks?
[13:11:41] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, i need energy in the mornings
[13:11:49] <Nasp> How else are you supposed to cope with life without caffeine
[13:11:49] <MaNa2k> i dont like coffee
[13:12:00] <MaNa2k> or tea
[13:12:06] <MaNa2k> i guess tea is oki somethimes
[13:12:13] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Do a (small) work out first

[13:12:34] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, that will just make my muscles relaxed and make me sleepy
[13:13:03] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, the only thing i feel like helps me is to not eat anything in the morning
[13:13:26] <MaNa2k> if i have eaten something, then i need coke or energy drink to stay awake
[13:14:27] <JakeSays> MaNa2k: is coke legal there?
[13:14:31] <MaNa2k> not eating anything in the morning does make me low on energy, but for some reason i stay awake

[13:16:10] <Nasp> How fast is full speed?
[13:16:12] <JakeSays> the parts for superclock v4
[13:16:52] <JakeSays> Nasp: i can squeeze 120mm/s out of one of my printers, but quality suffers
[13:17:27] <JakeSays> but these are final prints so i'm sticking at 50mm/s
[13:18:46] <Tobbi_> Can anyone do me a favour and kill me? I'm just reading a very complicated user story.

[13:19:34] <Tobbi_> nvm...
[13:19:37] <Nasp> Maybe i should just make them in one big PR
[13:19:49] <Nasp> Tobbi_:  Ohh noes 2.5 weeks of work
[13:19:56] <Tobbi_> I sense sarcasm? :D
[13:19:57] <Nasp> try a year :D
[13:20:08] <Tobbi_> I could inflate the work to be over a year's worth
[13:21:15] <MaNa2k> Nasp, nah not really, havnt really started with pipelines anyhow. I guess we could do test on fields that must have data in certain format which erpB requires. erpB is 99% of the times the same in our cases
[13:22:03] <MaNa2k> but other then that its probably difficuly to predict stuff coming from external erp's
[13:22:09] <Nasp> Do you only do importing of data?

[13:22:22] <Nasp> I want a vanta black car
[13:22:37] <MaNa2k> Nasp, yea mostly importing, then processing\converting data to certain format so that it matches in erpB
[13:22:40] <JakeSays> bmw has one iirc

[13:24:10] <Nasp> MaNa2k: And you have no tests if the imported data is correct?
[13:24:50] <MaNa2k> well we do have some testst in code where we do some basic tests like checking for nulls and stuff
[13:25:08] <MaNa2k> and some other testes in code that check if data is in certain format
[13:25:48] <MaNa2k> but these arnt unittest
[13:26:27] <Nasp> Why is it people take forever to review pull requests
[13:27:04] <MaNa2k> Nasp, probably because people hate looking at others code
[13:27:14] <Nasp> It just blocks me from doing anything really
[13:27:32] <Nasp> I even said at standup we should prioritize reviewing them because other people are blocked  meanwhile
[13:29:34] <MaNa2k> whats blocking for me, every time i start new project, i have to code in a certain crazy structre our senior has made, theres basically no explnanation anywhere on how it works.
[13:30:01] <MaNa2k> ever new project i start is a pain, because something has always changed
[13:30:06] <MaNa2k> *every

[13:33:17] <Nasp> MaNa2k:  New project as in csproj or?
[13:34:14] <MaNa2k> they are really simple tasks, but instead the senior decided to make a universal solution that would work for every customer, the basic idea was to resue the erpX that the cusomer is using. The idea isnt bad, but the problem is we hardly get any customers that use the same erpX
[13:34:27] <Nasp> I was told the other day the reason we hadnt hired a new frontend dev was there wasnt enough managers...
[13:34:33] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: So, time to review that process? :D

[13:37:01] <Nasp> It takes like an hour to make one

[13:38:08] <Nasp> Well then he needs to change the template as well

[13:38:40] <Nasp> What kind of changes?
[13:38:52] <Nasp> A new empty project should be fairly easy to follow
[13:39:17] <MaNa2k> Nasp, yea i have a feeling that will not happing.
[13:39:49] <MaNa2k> Nasp, changes like suddenly change the datatype of a table column without notifying

[13:53:48] <MaNa2k> lets say we have 10 customers, and all of them use different erpx with their own api, then we have to create 10 projects for all the apis
[13:54:24] <MaNa2k> in these project we have stuff like auth, connect, downloading\uploaded data
[13:54:36] <MaNa2k> the idea is good
[13:55:09] <MaNa2k> that we have split up the code for each erpx\api
[13:55:27] <MaNa2k> but the problem is, theres rarely any customer using the same erp
[13:55:55] <MaNa2k> and even if it is, they hardly use it the same way, they have their own way to use that erp\api.
[13:56:07] <MatthiasVance> 1500 people are downloading TrueCrypt every week?
[13:56:10] <MatthiasVance> What is up with that
[13:56:19] <MaNa2k> so what happens is we end up making special hardcoded cases inside the common code for that customer
[13:56:27] <MaNa2k> which kind of defeats the purpose
[13:56:39] <Nasp> How many different customers do you have running on this?
[13:57:47] <MaNa2k> forgot to say, each customer usually has many workflows.
[13:58:00] <MaNa2k> right now we have aronud 140 i think

[13:58:56] <MaNa2k> i long the old times when we made simple console apps to do stuff
[13:59:15] <MaNa2k> now we have to deal with azure and all of its shit
[14:00:30] <MaNa2k> forgot to tell, we also have these old legacy console apps running on a different sepearte vm. They have very little error rate
[14:01:12] <MaNa2k> more complexity just makes software break easiers
[14:01:59] <MatthiasVance> MaNa2k: Cloud has no impact on how you run this btw, you can still keep the same console apps and run them as is
[14:02:05] <MatthiasVance> So it's more that the code ALSO changed
[14:02:30] <MatthiasVance> But do you both reflect on how well the current process works and improve upon it?
[14:03:27] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, yes, but we dont do console apps anymore, because it was a pain working with webjobs, dont remember the details. We mostly do function apps now. Either timetriggered onces, or http triggered one
[14:03:40] <MatthiasVance> Sounds clean enough
[14:04:04] <MaNa2k> MatthiasVance, no time to reflect on stuff. we have tried that on some big projects
[14:04:23] <MatthiasVance> No I mean in general, you never take a step back and think "wtf are we doing, does it still work?"

[14:17:45] <Nasp> Lazyness i think
[14:17:48] <MatthiasVance> Ask them

[14:22:43] <MatthiasVance> You still have to do your job
[14:22:45] <Nasp> It matters in the way that i think his heart isn't in it anymore
[14:23:00] <MatthiasVance> If it's affecting their work, time to have a chat?
[14:26:13] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Or is that not something you're comfortable doing? Then you can maybe escalate?
[14:26:24] <Nasp> Not comfortable, not sure i'm allowed

[14:46:54] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  on the build server
[14:47:00] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Nothing really
[14:47:05] <MatthiasVance> If you're going to test after every PR that's the same thing as testing after the entirity
[14:47:11] <Nasp> But small changes could break stuff like binding or the likes
[14:47:17] <Nasp> Like the FromRoute thing broke
[14:47:33] <Nasp> Test is run on build together with PR
[14:47:44] <MatthiasVance> Run them locally then as well?
[14:47:46] <Nasp> I could also just try and move 10 controllers and push it and see if it builds
[14:47:50] <Nasp> Can't run them locally
[14:47:56] <MatthiasVance> 🤦‍♂️
[14:47:59] <Suchiman> Nasp: but changing namespace does not affect FromRoute so...
[14:48:02] <Nasp> Selenium shit tests
[14:48:15] <Suchiman> Nasp: literally the only thing that could break is the build and you can build locally right
[14:48:15] <Nasp> Suchiman: No but tehy are moved from a framework project to a core project
[14:48:27] <MatthiasVance> Why can't you run selenium tests locally? Might be worth setting that up for this
[14:48:34] <biberu> why can't you run selenium locally? ^
[14:48:37] <Nasp> I can run them, but i can' trust them
[14:48:41] <Nasp> Same with on the build server
[14:48:46] <biberu> it can be containerized btw
[14:48:48] <Nasp> Need to run time 5 times before you know if it's a bug or not
[14:48:48] <MatthiasVance> If you don't trust them, why do you care?
[14:49:07] <Nasp> I can't merge em when they don't pass
[14:49:13] <Suchiman> Nasp: or just keep pushing commits to the same PR, push, check if build is green, push some more, rinse and repeat
[14:49:20] <Nasp> Suchiman:  I was considering that
[14:49:23] <MatthiasVance> He says a build takes 1 hour though
[14:49:24] <MatthiasVance> xD
[14:49:26] <Nasp> But i still need to wait 1 hour between each push
[14:49:39] <biberu> perhaps you could just start your application, db and whatnot in some containers and run your integration and e2e tests like that?
[14:49:40] <MatthiasVance> I'd do them all at the same time, figure out what is broken, resolve ALL the issues
[14:49:46] <Suchiman> Nasp: wouldn't go any faster even if they reviewed :P
[14:49:49] <MatthiasVance> ^
[14:50:18] <Nasp> You sometimes also end up having those annoying csproj conflicts
[14:50:36] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Are you just making excuses now for not doing it in one go? :P
[14:50:40] <MatthiasVance> You can fix everything afterwards
[14:50:44] <biberu> re project conflicts, are you using framework or sdk style projects?
[14:50:49] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Fix what afterwards?
[14:50:54] <MatthiasVance> Any errors that you have
[14:51:03] <Nasp> Migrate 300 controllers and then spend 4 weeks fixing that?
[14:51:15] <MatthiasVance> If things break you'd already  have to fix it?
[14:51:19] <JakeSays> push all the shit!
[14:51:24] <Nasp> Yes but then i push 300 controllers in one go
[14:51:34] <Nasp> Then i break all the things
[14:51:54] <JakeSays> why would that break all the things? doesn't all the things run locally?
[14:52:04] <biberu> Nasp: wouldn't that break happen in a test or staging environment?

[14:52:29] <Nasp> But then i'd probably spend 4 weeks fixing that
[14:52:32] <Nasp> Then what is saved
[14:52:45] <JakeSays> Nasp: i think the # of controllers is irrelevant. it's the quality that counts.
[14:53:16] <biberu> when it's that many i assume you're following some pattern, so the number of instances shouldn't be as important as the number of variations
[14:53:32] <Nasp> Not sure i follow
[14:53:45] <Nasp> Suchiman:  also when you migrated how many controllers did oyu have?
[14:53:46] <JakeSays> biberu: 1 instance == 1 variation
[14:53:51] <Nasp> BEcause i did that in another project and it was a lot smaller
[14:54:02] <biberu> if you apply the same change 300 times you can still regard it as one change

[15:42:32] <canton7> I keep meaning to give it a decent try, as a better way of writing automations. That, or write an equivalent in .NET (over MQTT, since all my stuff eventually ends up on mqtt, and you can interact quite nicely with HA from it)
[15:43:15] <MatthiasVance> canton7: I am primarily interested in Philips Hue (of which I know the API quite well) and maybe 2 other things. The overhead of the YAML stuff (or Python in this case) is huge.
[15:43:45] <MatthiasVance> They (HA maintainers) mentioned that this year's focus would be on ease of use in the UI especially for those things
[15:44:28] <canton7> Fair. My setup's all tradfri, but I've linked it into zigbee2mqtt and then up into HA, which works really well. And gives you an API which is just sending/receiving MQTT messages, which is also really nice
[15:45:28] <MatthiasVance> Ah yeah I am planning to expand with Tradfri as well .. sensors at 30% of the price :D

[17:48:49] <Sora> lol https://stackoverflow.com/a/55951427/9665729
[17:48:58] <Sora> this is exactly what I meant
[17:49:06] <canton7> json.net will deserialize to user-provided types if you tell it to, which can be a security hole
[17:49:44] <canton7> Right, that's a problem with TypeNameHandling.Auto, not with dynamic. You can pull off exactly the same thing without dynamic
[17:51:19] <Sora> so TypeNameHandling.None should be safe
[17:51:19] <interop_madness> my first question: which static security scanner did OP use?
[17:51:56] <canton7> Yeah, the problem is the one which always bites deserializes, which is letter the data specify which class to deserialize as

[20:59:33] <dan01> Because I really like Swift, feel it relates a lot to C#
[20:59:35] <canton7> They both support accessing an underlying relational database as if it was an object store, fetching graphs of objects, filtering based on some non-SQL query language, change tracking and notification (I think?), etc. You'd use them to achieve the same thing

[23:21:17] <DevJohnC> I don't think that AvaloniaUI uses native widgets for rendering
[23:21:47] <JakeSays> DevJohnC: it does, but there is a standalone renderer. not sure how far along they got with it though

[23:38:17] <ki9a> so flutter is a bit like Swing?

[23:40:24] <Flonk> In source code generators, how do you iterate through all the classes from the referencing assembly? Like, I want to look for classes that have an attribute, and then generate code for it.
[23:40:36] <Flonk> s/it/them
[23:42:49] <JakeSays> ki9a: no. flutter looks good everywhere, dammit
[23:43:35] <JakeSays> ki9a: it's actually a decent least common denominator

[23:50:31] <palindrome> rider users, I am trying to step into System.Net code and its not working, but for other libraries it works fine. Am I missing something?
[23:52:39] <ki9a> what other libraries?
[23:52:59] <ki9a> System.Net is in corlib, among a billion other things
[23:53:05] <ki9a> Usually doesn' thave symbols
