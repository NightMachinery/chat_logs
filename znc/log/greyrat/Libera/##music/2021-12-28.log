[17:05:56] <GaZ-mAnIaC> There was this Soul Music hit in the 1970's where a man with a Billy Preston like voice was almost shouting something along the lines of "Hey-Hey, Chitta batta boom-bah" in the refrain with some room reverb.  I can't seem to locate it by humming it or with lyric find.  Would anyone have an idea of the title/artist?
