[05:55:32] <rs_> shgvbvri: when sharing videos, it is better to share them as gif because in that way, we can use the browser to open the file easily and securely. File formats such as mpeg, avi, mkv, m3u8, etc can be used to trigger a server-side request forgery in many media players.

[19:17:30] <shgvbvri> looking at https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-completion/blob/master/autoload/vim_dadbod_completion/schemas.vim, adding sqlite column support would require a bit more effort than that.
[19:18:32] <shgvbvri> whole conf I did for ui helper is 07vim.g.db_ui_table_helpers = { sqlite = { ['Columns'] = "PRAGMA table_info('{table}')" } } (in lua)
[19:19:43] <zeraphel> and did that work?
[19:20:52] <shgvbvri> yup
[19:20:57] <shgvbvri> for ui solely
[19:21:07] <shgvbvri> just adds a Columns entry

[21:11:32] <mingdao> I have the same ~/.vimrc on host workstation and host headache.  I can copy a line of text from a wiki article in Firefox and paste it into `vim file` on workstation.  But when I try paste it into `vim file` on headache, it is not the same text. 
[21:11:41] <mingdao> How to troubleshoot this?
[21:12:07] <romainl> do you have the same Vim?
[21:12:14] <romainl> $ vim --version | curl -F 'f:1=<-' ix.io
[21:12:35] <romainl> also, define "not the same text"
[21:13:24] <mingdao> I found the problem.  I have .vimrc in user mingdao's $HOME, but not in root's $HOME.
[21:13:44] <mingdao> So I assume root is using whatever vimrc the distro has somewhere.
[21:14:15] <romainl> don't use root
[21:14:18] <lgc_> sudoedit
[21:15:14] <mingdao> Don't use sudo; use su -
[21:15:44] <mingdao> I am editing /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf as root, just as I've done for the last 18 years.
[21:16:25] <lgc_> sudoedit is not sudo
[21:16:57] <romainl> $ sudo -e /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf (or sudoedit)
[21:17:05] <mingdao> Then please give me a link to the source, and I'll read about it.
[21:17:17] <romainl> $ man sudo
[21:17:29] <lgc_> https://linux.die.net/man/8/sudoedit
[21:17:37] <mingdao> -bash: sudo: command not found
[21:17:45] <mingdao> I think I already said I don't use sudo.
[21:18:09] <romainl> you didn't say you didn't HAVE sudo
[21:18:13] <lgc_> ^
[21:18:14] <mingdao> https://linux.die.net/man/8/sudoedit
[21:18:44] <mingdao> One must HAVE sudo to USE sudo.
[21:18:52] <mingdao> I choose security over convenience.
[21:18:52] <lgc_> obviously
[21:19:04] <lgc_> ok
[21:19:05] <mingdao> I haven't been cracked, ever, so I'm sticking with it.
[21:19:25] <romainl> stick with your problem, then
[21:19:30] <zeraphel> mingdao: how are you 'pasting'?  is the xserver ran by user and vim ran by root (sudo / uid0/ etc) and you're trying to access "+P ?
[21:19:40] <mingdao> I solved my problem before you started this convo.
[21:19:43] <romainl> or copy your vimrc over to root's home
[21:20:19] <mingdao> zeraphel: Pasting with the gpm mouse server.  Highlight with the left button, paste into file with the scroll wheel.
[21:20:53] <mingdao> Problem was solved: 11:43:23 < mingdao> I found the problem.  I have .vimrc in user mingdao's $HOME, but not in root's $HOME
[21:20:57] <mingdao> Thanks.

[21:59:41] *** Joins: darksun (~darksun@user/darksun)
[22:00:42] <zeraphel> shgvbvri: It's fundemental i suppose,  I don't exactly write .sql files either,  i am writing sql statements in other filetypes,  I figured the best-case scenario using dadbod would be switching to one of its buffers then copying the query back.  And i assumed a basic set of completion functions may be obtained from ft_sql.  Which howevre I'm not sure how i'd enable without switching the filetype
[22:00:43] <zeraphel> every time.
[22:01:50] <shgvbvri> in that usecase I'd focus on slime and repl
[22:02:36] <shgvbvri> and good split back and forth, where tmux is helpful for example, or even :term
[22:02:44] <shgvbvri> slime supports both
[22:03:22] <zeraphel> quoting raymond hettinger .. There must be a better way
[22:03:29] <shgvbvri> it's what I used to use before integrating the dadbod ecosystem

[22:04:16] <zeraphel> This may turn you off, But have you ever tried https://github.com/joe-re/sql-language-server
[22:05:36] <shgvbvri> nope, I never tried an sql-language-server, but I did look for such stuff when I was into sql editing, then I went into dadbod stuff and didn't look further. At the time there were no sql lsps.
[22:06:09] <shgvbvri> if they work now, can be of good use, I'm all for it :)
[22:06:35] <shgvbvri> though that project seems kinda dead

[23:29:49] <structoha> thank you romainl 
[23:30:36] <structoha> how do you manage copying renaming files in vim in a nicer way, do you use nerdtree functionalities, is there any recommendation? i need a fast workflow instead of going to my next tmux pane :( 
[23:33:00] <strajder> use a tilling wm like dwm
[23:33:36] <strajder> Mod+<n> = next tag with an open terminal, then rename the file there
