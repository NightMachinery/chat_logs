[03:11:44] <JackNZ> Kia ora all, would appreciate some help if anyone has a moment as I'm absolutely stumped on why I'm getting an error. I'm updating our project from Django 2.2 to 3.2, and a standard `update_or_create` call is throwing this error: https://dpaste.org/AdyB Code is here:
[03:11:45] <JackNZ> https://github.com/uccser/cs-unplugged/blob/develop/csunplugged/at_home/management/commands/_ActivityLoader.py#L122-L128

[03:14:53] <FunkyBob> JackNZ: shouldn't defaults be passed as a keyword argument?
[03:15:27] <FunkyBob> hmm
[03:15:31] <FunkyBob> reading closer
[03:16:06] <FunkyBob> am curious why the line numbers differ
[03:17:59] <FunkyBob> it smells like one of the annoyingly misleading Python error messages... where what it says is _technically_ true, but not helpful in realising the mistake
[03:19:16] <FunkyBob> JackNZ: is this the only error you're getting? or are there other issues with this model?
[03:20:06] *** Quits: PantelicGR (~PantelicG@user/pantelicgr) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:23:24] <JackNZ> FunkyBob Apologises around the line numbers, I had added some tests above it help debug it. They are gone now.
[03:23:49] <FunkyBob> ok, cool, so long as it's not a case of "testing one thing, reading another " :)
[03:24:07] <JackNZ> FunkyBob I'm getting that same feeling too, that's it technically true but it's something funky.
[03:24:39] <JackNZ> I'll do a check through the whole project, but it is such an odd error to pop up.
[03:24:46] <JackNZ> Thanks
[03:34:11] <FunkyBob> google that error message... I have a memory of it meaning something like ... the same argument passed as positional and kwarg, or... something unintuitive
[03:42:47] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: when i make a RESTful request, the parameter must be in the URL or in the payload?
[03:46:34] *** Joins: bbbbbb (~peppbel@191.96.106.198)
[03:48:51] *** Quits: pipapipapipo (~peppbel@076-083-166-225.res.spectrum.com) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[03:49:53] <FunkyBob> yes
[03:50:37] <wallbroken> "yes" mans that it can be in both sites?
[03:50:46] <FunkyBob> depends on what "the parameter" is
[03:51:21] <wallbroken> i remember that you can put in url using & parameter separator
[03:51:46] <wallbroken> or just a path can also be the parameter?
[03:51:47] <FunkyBob> parameters can be in the path, the querystring, or the request body.
[03:51:58] <wallbroken> ok
[03:52:09] <FunkyBob> typically what you put in the path selects the object to work on
[03:52:14] <wallbroken> that way it always be RESTful compliant?
[03:52:27] <FunkyBob> the querystring is conventially used to indicate filtering and selection
[03:52:48] <wallbroken> and when do i need to put something in the payload?
[03:52:57] <FunkyBob> no, RESTful is about following the design patterns from Roy Fielding's paper
[03:53:32] <FunkyBob> if you're sending data for create or update actions, they'd typically go in a request body.
[03:54:05] <wallbroken> in that case i will use POST verb
[03:54:07] <wallbroken> and not GET
[03:54:17] <FunkyBob> not PUT ?
[03:54:38] <wallbroken> well, i always confuse PUT and POST
[03:55:56] <FunkyBob> originally POST was meant for creating a new record, and PUT for replacing (editing) an existing one
[03:57:44] <wallbroken> what to just send data to the server?
[03:58:05] <wallbroken> i think that the client will ignore how the server will manage the sent data
[03:58:14] <FunkyBob> huh?
[03:58:29] <FunkyBob> different verbs mean different things.
[03:58:35] <FunkyBob> that's just how HTTP was designed.
[03:58:40] <FunkyBob> [and generally how language works]
[03:58:57] <wallbroken> both PUT and POST will mean: send data to the server
[03:58:57] <dre> mornin' all
[03:58:58] <wallbroken> right?
[03:59:42] <FunkyBob> GET does too... and DELETE...
[03:59:49] <FunkyBob> it's not just "send data to the server"
[04:00:00] <PaulWay[w]> PUT and POST have slightly different meanings in REST terminology.
[04:00:10] <dre> I know this question might've come up previously; but if you have a Model with some numbers, and you want to find model instances on either side of that value, is there a nice and easy way to do that?
[04:00:44] <PaulWay[w]> "on either side" is going to be easy if you just mean 'plus or minus 1'.
[04:00:47] <FunkyBob> dre: could you clarify what counts as "on either side"?
[04:01:00] <FunkyBob> "nearest value lower/higher" or "+1/-1"?
[04:01:04] <FunkyBob> or something else?
[04:01:06] <PaulWay[w]> If your numbers are randomly scattered, then that's much harder.
[04:01:34] <PaulWay[w]> That's an annotation with 'find the maximum value lower than X', and 'find the minimum value greater than X'.
[04:01:54] <dre> yeah sorry. consider I have Model with a "index_num" and the current code is "instance = Model.objects.filter(index_number__gt=target).order_by(index_number).first()"
[04:01:57] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: the semantics around what each verb means have consequences... like that a GET request can be cached, but a POST cannot.
[04:02:17] <FunkyBob> dre: next_by ?
[04:02:21] <dre> and if not instance: instance = Model.objects.filter(index_number__lt=target).order_by(index_number).last()
[04:02:43] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: for example if i need to send an image to the server
[04:02:50] <wallbroken> should i use POST or PUT?
[04:03:05] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/instances/#django.db.models.Model.get_next_by_FOO
[04:03:10] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: depends
[04:03:14] <dre> thanks FunkyBob
[04:03:26] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: is it a new image, or replacing an existing record?
[04:03:27] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: if you want to keep it simple, then you can use POST.
[04:03:43] <PaulWay[w]> If you really want to follow REST semantics then you need to consider PUT to update an image.
[04:03:53] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: why are you referring to a DATABASE?
[04:04:00] <wallbroken> i cannot just be a file in the filesystem?
[04:04:24] <FunkyBob> who said database?
[04:04:29] <FunkyBob> and how is a filesystem not a database?
[04:04:30] <PaulWay[w]> In Django REST Framework, POST does not take an index parameter, and PUT does.
[04:04:38] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: nobody said DRF
[04:04:48] <PaulWay[w]> Just giving an example of the semantics.
[04:04:54] <PaulWay[w]> And you'll still need to know which image on disk is associated with which record in your database...
[04:05:10] <wallbroken> you called it "record" and records are rows in a database in my knowledge
[04:05:12] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: assuming the image is related to a record in the DB
[04:05:38] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: rows are records... but not all records are rows.

[04:06:35] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: if you're talking REST, you're using HTTP to interact with records on the server...

[04:07:09] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: neither I nor Google know what pyloctomic means...

[07:31:04] <JackNZ> FunkyBob: Just to let you know I found the issue, I found a dependency (django-modeltranslation) that wasn't updated to include Django 3.2 support. Don't fully understand why it was caused an issue since it wasn't overriding the default 'objects' manager, though it was used for those objects. Not going to spend more time looking into it, but glad
[07:31:04] <JackNZ> it's sorted. Thanks for your help, your comment about the models helped me solve it.

[10:31:57] <pycode> hello everybody
[10:32:45] <pycode> i try again, does anyone have messed around with ListView and FormMIxin?
[10:33:02] <pycode> it seems not possible to have a list and a form on the same page, because ListView does not have the post() method
[10:33:24] <pycode> so i wonder what do you do when you have a list and a form on the same page
[10:33:54] <pycode> i know that i can use FormView and put the list inside get_context_data but then i need also to manage the pagination myself
[10:34:02] <pycode> so i wonder how you do that
[10:35:02] <serafeim> pycode: you can use https://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/3.1/django.views.generic.list/MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin/ along with https://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/3.1/django.views.generic.edit/ProcessFormView/
[10:35:09] <serafeim> or even implement the `post()` in your view
[10:37:23] <pycode> serafeim, thank you i am going to test it
[10:37:39] <pycode> i MUST...MUST use ccbv.co.uk more!
[10:38:42] <pycode> serafeim, please help me to understand how to read it better.... now i am on https://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/3.1/django.views.generic.list/MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin/
[10:38:52] <pycode> i suppose it needs a model attribute on the class
[10:38:54] <pycode> i do not see it
[10:39:31] <pycode> i mean i "suppose" it needs get_queryset()
[10:39:37] <pycode> no? but i do not see it serafeim
[10:39:54] <serafeim> ah yes. it also needs the MultipleObjectMixin... check how ListView works: https://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/3.1/django.views.generic.list/ListView/
[10:40:38] <pycode> so i should use MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin instead right?
[10:41:22] <pycode> pardon 	MultipleObjectMixin
[10:41:26] <serafeim> both.
[10:41:34] <serafeim> they do different jobs
[10:42:10] <pycode> serafeim, class TestimonialListView(MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin, MultipleObjectMixin, ProcessFormView):
[10:42:10] <pycode> ?
[10:42:18] <serafeim> yes that should do it
[10:42:50] <pycode> serafeim, but what https://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/3.1/django.views.generic.list/MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin/ is doing exactly?
[10:42:59] <pycode> i suppose multipleobjectmixin hold my data
[10:43:03] <pycode> and set it in get_context_data
[10:43:04] <pycode> no?
[10:43:09] <pycode> so why do i also need https://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/3.1/django.views.generic.list/MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin/ ?
[10:45:05] <serafeim> ListView uses it... but now that I see its source code i guess it ain't really needed
[10:45:19] <serafeim> it just adds the default fallback template name
[10:45:21] <pycode> it is needed otherwise i mess render_to_response
[10:45:47] <serafeim> you can just use TemplateResponseMixin if you want instead
[10:46:23] <pycode> now i am testing: class TestimonialListView(MultipleObjectMixin, TemplateResponseMixin, ProcessFormView):
[10:46:31] <pycode> but i get this error: 'TestimonialListView' object has no attribute 'object_list'

[10:51:22] <pycode> serafeim, ^^
[10:52:48] <serafeim> hm strange
[10:54:55] <pycode> it is hard to have a form and a list
[10:54:55] <pycode> :D
[11:01:48] <pycode> however it's a bit hard to read the class details
[11:01:51] <pycode> for example: https://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/3.1/django.views.generic.edit/ProcessFormView/
[11:02:09] <pycode> i must open the postmethod to understand it calls form_valid() method (and i need to implement it too)
[11:02:27] <pycode> i do not see that method on the methods list
[11:03:25] <pycode> same for get_context_data it is not mentioned on the list
[11:05:23] <pycode> hard to deal with CBV :/
[11:05:43] <serafeim> well some of the methods are implmeneted on the FormView
[11:05:50] <serafeim> maybe you could inherit directly from FormView
[11:06:54] <pycode> serafeim, I have to deal with list too
[11:07:32] <pycode> FormMIxin, ListView but i have the post problem ...sure i can implement the post method but sounds strange that nobody has messed around with a form and a simple paginated list :)
[11:07:37] <serafeim> well to tell you the truth, in such cases i decide either to use FormView or ListView and implement what's missing directly on the get_context_data (or even I add a post method)
[11:07:52] <serafeim> pycode: what will that form do ?
[11:08:09] <serafeim> in a list view what you have a form you usually use it for filter
[11:08:18] <serafeim> in such cases you use django-filters
[11:08:20] <pycode> serafeim, it is a testimonials page so basically i have a list of testimonials AND a form to send the LEAD
[11:08:24] <serafeim> which has view for that
[11:08:43] <pycode> no no i do not need to filter it is basically a list of testimonials
[11:08:50] <serafeim> if the form posts then you need to implement it yourself. so just add  the form in the get_context_data and fix the post
[11:08:52] <serafeim> it's simple
[11:09:20] <pycode> serafeim, FormMixin, ListView + post method?
[11:09:51] <serafeim> probably. or even just a listview + post + get_context_data
[11:10:14] <pycode> serafeim, so i need to check if the form is valid on get_context_data right ?
[11:10:49] <serafeim> no on post
[11:11:26] <pycode> yes right ok
[11:11:35] <pycode> i try

[11:17:08] <pycode> so i need to fix it somehow
[11:17:15] <serafeim> the post ain't correct
[11:17:20] <serafeim> if the form is valid you need to redirect
[11:17:47] <pycode> yes that's true
[11:17:50] <pycode> but if there are errors
[11:17:56] <pycode> how can i pass the form with errors to the context?
[11:18:01] <pycode> because as you see i pass form=form
[11:18:07] <pycode> but then in get_context_data i override "form"
[11:18:10] <serafeim> also in your get_context_data you are always initialize a new form so if the form has errors it will be re initialized
[11:18:21] <pycode> so i need to check if it already exists in kwargs
[11:18:29] <pycode> serafeim, exactly
[11:18:32] <serafeim> yes i think that's it
[11:18:34] <pycode> what can i do?
[11:18:35] <pycode> ok

[15:11:42] <tm007> This endpoint calls out 3 external APIs, makes some further calculations, formats the data and returns some data.
[15:11:53] <tm007> How to make the 3 API calls parallel?

[15:13:39] <tm007> So i trigger 3 celery functions to API calls.
[15:13:39] <flying_sausages> You could look at celery
[15:13:42] <GinFuyou> tm007, threads as one option I guess, I fear I mostly used async CPU-bound tasks then I\O ones

[15:38:37] <pycode> GinFuyou, there is a problem that is driving my crazy, i have this class: https://bpa.st/32BQ
[15:38:45] <pycode> i cant see the message on template
[15:38:46] <pycode> i have
[15:38:50] <GinFuyou> tm007, not really, as I said, I mostly used multi-processioning or even subprocessing, you could go to #python and ask what is a way to to make parallel requests
[15:38:57] <pycode> middleware and context_preprocessor
[15:39:01] <pycode> enabled
[15:39:15] <pycode> if i do {% for message in messages %} in the template i cant see it
[15:39:38] <pycode> if after message.succedd(...) i put print(list(messages.get_messages(self.request))) i CAN see the message
[15:39:48] <pycode> on the view
[15:40:00] <pycode> but after redirect no
[15:40:15] <pycode> i do not know if the redirect is the problem
[15:40:27] <pycode> but messages should work with redirect too
[15:40:33] <GinFuyou> mmm, when redirect happens?
[15:40:47] <pycode> GinFuyou, line 15
[15:40:49] <GinFuyou> If messages are accessed they'll be removed I believe
[15:40:50] <pycode> return HttpResponseRedirect(self.success_url)
[15:41:02] <pycode> yes but when ?
[15:41:07] <GinFuyou> If not yeah, they stay after redirect
[15:41:08] <pycode> i mean i am processing them in post()

[15:42:53] <GinFuyou> hm, looks OK I think
[15:43:15] <GinFuyou> what you have in the template?
[15:43:18] <pycode> if i move the print(list(messages.get_messages(self.request)) afer the print i can see the message
[15:43:22] <pycode> in my template just
[15:43:33] <pycode> {%for message in messages %} {{ message }} {% endfor %}

[16:35:51] <GinFuyou> because you want to filter by two fields, providing four of them
[16:36:33] <pycode> GinFuyou, maybe the listview is doing something weird internally
[16:36:34] <GinFuyou> so you either find an existing entry by two, and update other two, or create new object with all four as new
[16:36:54] <GinFuyou> pycode, it shouldn't as far as I know
[16:37:49] <pycode> GinFuyou, or maybe messages can be created during a post request... hmm
[16:37:51] <pycode> idk
[16:37:54] <pycode> i am desperated
[16:38:44] <GinFuyou> They can be created. Again have you tested admin? e.g. if you delete a record it will redirect you back to listview and show message in the top how many records were deleted
[16:39:01] <GinFuyou> Well, that's point of having message store
[16:39:48] <mad_moses> GinFuyou: got it, thank you

[16:58:26] <pycode> GinFuyou, what do you usually do if you have to deal with a form + listview?

[16:59:51] <pycode> the problem is listview is not dealing with post
[17:00:34] <GinFuyou> that's why I use form handling view as base as I said. Adding a queryset to context is way more trivial

[17:44:23] <kerfuffle> (thousands of data points per frequest) and in memory storage like redis is not feasible bcause data loss cannot happen

[17:47:16] <simernes> I'm having a problem with pylint. In settings.py, in INSTALLED_APPS I have 'myapp', but when I run pylint --load-plugins pylint_django myproject, I get error `no module named 'myapp'`. If I change it to 'myproject.myapp', then pylint works, but I can no longer start the project normally with `manage.py runserver`

[17:59:26] <la_croix> Is there a way of having a single django custom field use multiple database columns? I would like a semver field (1.2.3-a1), stored in five columns (major minor patch alpha/beta pre-version), but that become a single python object when read

[18:31:32] <la_croix> moldy: the problem is that I want to order by it, which means an index would be nice. Semvers don't necessarily order alphabetically/numerically (e.g. a 'normal' release (1.0.0) should come after alpha and beta (1.0.0-a1, 1.0.0-b2), but alphabetical sorting would put it before
[18:31:48] <moldy> la_croix: ah, i see
[18:31:55] <moldy> la_croix: then i'd normalize it, yup
[18:32:15] <moldy> i wouldn't bother with a custom field though, just write some functions to query / transform it
[18:32:47] <la_croix> moldy: Ah, fair enough, so there's no way of getting a django field to be a 'composite' of db columns?

[21:48:45] <ChrisWarrick> what kind of xml? if templates don’t fit your needs, then just use lxml
[21:48:51] <crowbar> shodan45: there are xml libraries
[21:49:21] <shodan45> xml for a SOAP API thing
[21:49:30] *** Quits: stats4647 (~stats4647@ip174-67-220-13.oc.oc.cox.net) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[21:49:49] <crowbar> shodan45: there are soap libraries... are you trying to call a soap service as a client?
[21:49:55] <shodan45> 3rd party. I'm the client.
[21:50:53] <crowbar> shodan45: I luckily haven't been forced to suffer a soap API in a long while but something like zeep might be the answer.  never used it.
[21:51:20] <shodan45> yeah.... I *think* this API wants XML as data types.... trying to read someone else's PHP code that uses this API
[21:51:52] <crowbar> the whole point of soap is that you aren't writing xml.  your soap library reads the WSDL file and generates the method stubs for you in your language
[21:53:25] <crowbar> shodan45: https://docs.python-zeep.org/en/master/ in the simple example the ConvertSpeed function is created by zeep based on the wsdl and when called from python, the soap library is handling the call to the remote server.
[21:53:55] <shodan45> crowbar: yeah. this was a php dev, so...... >_>
[21:54:35] <crowbar> if you ever find yourself writing xml by hand take 10 steps back and reassess.
[21:55:01] <crowbar> even in enterprise java development you shouldn't be touching xml directly and everything there is xml.

[22:58:23] <crowbar> is the wsdl you're using public?

[23:02:38] <crowbar> shodan45: yeah good luck with all that.  soap is indeed pain.  why do you think you need xml because the value accepts any value?
[23:02:54] <crowbar> just start writing python code like you'd expect the function call to work and see what happens.
