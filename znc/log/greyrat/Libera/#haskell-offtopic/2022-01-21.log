[12:21:18] <kuribas> Next the team lead is chiming in, how I will make things to complicated, nobody will understand what I did, and I should reconsider and write "idiomatic" clojure code.
[12:21:30] <kuribas> Because parser combinators are apparently very hard to debug in clojure.

[13:43:48] <kuribas> I just asked the team-chat if they know good parser libraries.
[13:44:16] <[exa]> you might have a bit of micromanagement problem there then. :]
[13:45:13] <kuribas> he was following on the team chat, and I must have triggered some panic mode
[13:45:38] <[exa]> yep
[13:46:37] <[exa]> we've get the problem "use monads without saying it's monads", now you have "use parser combinators without saying it's parser combinators"
[13:46:51] <[exa]> then get results
[13:47:10] <[exa]> then the parser combinators are acceptable
[13:48:12] <[exa]> not sure how the situation is at your place but I've seen many programmers who just waste time trying any new technology out there without doing much useful work
[13:48:44] <[exa]> and looking from a manager perspective, this is quite common and chance of a new technology to work is literally tiny
[13:51:10] <[exa]> I guess that feeling this statistic is not super pleasant but imagine what would be the difference for the management if there was another person instead of you, insisting on usage of php11 or something because it fixes all problems™
[13:51:42] <kuribas> I would hope he trusts me more...
[13:52:04] <kuribas> or trust the "team".
[13:52:31] <kuribas> Also, he did study some haskell before, so I expected more from him.
[13:52:46] <[exa]> chances are that they might be trying to prevent bad decisions in a generic way without having much time to think about how to do that right (which is likely the case, because they would otherwise read all the PL papers right?)
[13:52:58] <[exa]> "study some haskell before" might be double-edged
[13:53:26] <kuribas> at some point he decided that it all was too complicated.
[13:53:26] <[exa]> most people leave the "basic" university haskell courses with a feeling that the language is completely mathematical and unusuable for anything real
[13:53:37] <kuribas> true
[13:53:45] <[exa]> o harsh reality
[13:53:46] <[exa]> o times
[13:54:34] <[exa]> I got used to avoid talking about any methodology until the results are out
[13:54:48] <[exa]> b/c you realistically don't know what is going to mess up
[13:55:06] <[exa]> also, scraping some prototypes in the process usually helps
[13:56:43] <kuribas> I also agree that many haskell solutions solve problems that are not real painpoints.
[13:58:45] <kuribas> If someone came with a good clojure solutation that was better than my combinators, I'd accept it...

[14:06:07] <kuribas> wouldn't that also mean that the manager should complain "after" it appears the code doesn't work, is too complicated, etc... ?

[14:08:01] <kuribas> Like SQL, RDBMS, unix, monoliths, etc...

[16:20:11] <kuribas> parser combinators could work in any language with HOFs.
[16:20:18] <kuribas> And closures.
[16:20:35] <kuribas> Which is why they don't work in emacs, which doesn't have closures...
[16:20:52] <kuribas> Maybe  you can simulate closures there...
[16:23:41] <geekosaur> I'd think the bigger problem is if you're trying to do parsing in elisp with anything more than regex, you're doing something very wrong :þ
[16:26:10] <kuribas> geekosaur: I wrote some kind of parser for haskell-indentation mode.
[16:26:22] <kuribas> it's definitely a hack, but works reasonably well...
[16:26:38] <kuribas> tokenisation works via regexes.
[16:27:18] <__monty__> Why would the general wisdom of not using REs for non-regular languages not apply?
[16:28:50] <kuribas> speed maybe?  EL is quite slow...
[16:29:53] <geekosaur> emacs is an editor. it's good at regex. it's fairly poor at proper parsing
[16:30:24] <kuribas> nope, emacs is a lisp environment, which happens to have an editor...
[16:30:38] <kuribas> with a realy antiquated lisp.
[16:31:45] <geekosaur> also becuase it is an editor the biggest constraint is not how well it does <x>, it's how quickly it returns control to the user
[16:32:14] <geekosaur> it also lacks threads so you can't push parsing into the background
[16:33:48] <kuribas> it also lacks modules.
