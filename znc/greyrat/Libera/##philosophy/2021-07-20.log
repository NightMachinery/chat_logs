[00:41:15] <DPA> Morality is in part your own sense of right and wrong, which tends to be shared & shaped to some extent by your social environment. As there are people hungering, and smashing watermelons may wast food, it can be seen as morally wrong by some.
[00:41:15] <DPA> However, in my opinion, not smashing the watermelon doesn't mean someone poor will get to eat it, so I don't see it as immoral. I do still think it's a waste, though. It's probably usually legal in most places.
[00:41:15] <DPA> I'm unsure if it's ethical or not. The water melon doesn't have feelings, and is to expire one way or another, and smashing it usually doesn't do any harm, so I guess it's probably not unethical in most circumstances.

[09:17:38] <kmh> whereas in the US swimming shorts are pretty much standard and speedos are usually a sign of being gay (unless you're a competitive swimmer)
[09:18:10] *** Joins: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.brockwell.irccloud.com)
[09:18:12] <kmh> TechTest, as i sau#id they perceive short as streets short rather than swim shorts
[09:18:40] <TechTest> kmh: it's the same here, you wouldn't go to the beach in a speed unless you are a 5 year old or unless you wanted to get weird looks
[09:18:42] <kmh> i.e. treat as as people juming in the pool with their pants on
[09:19:30] <kmh> TechTest,  but that is afaik a newer development in europe that started in the last 2 decades or so
[09:19:47] <TechTest> the reasoning they gave me af the pool is that swim trunks are considered leisure swim pool while the pool is exclusively for exercise and therefore everyone should wear exercise gear
[09:19:57] <TechTest> exercise gear = speedo
[09:20:21] <kmh> TechTest,  hmm a bit odd
[09:20:44] <kmh> maybe it is an attempt due reduce the amount of pool users
[09:20:52] <TechTest> kmh: they made me swim in my underwear, like regular cotton boxer briefs
[09:20:54] <arcturus> if the shorts are not body conforming they can flap around while swimming
[09:21:01] <arcturus> causing indecent exposure
[09:21:09] <TechTest> so hygiene is definitely not theor issue
[09:21:15] <kmh> if pools become too crowded they often can't be used anymore for training

[09:22:01] <TechTest> I don't think speedos stop people from hanging out in the pool without actually exercising
[09:22:22] <kmh> dunno just a guess
[09:22:40] <TechTest> also we should all agree that no guy looks good in a speedo
[09:23:19] <kmh> at least hear it is common that swimmers and leisure folks compete for access
[09:23:28] <kmh> why
[09:23:39] <kmh> i see no issue with a speedo
[09:24:03] <kmh> nor with a trunk
[09:24:06] <arcturus> its hygienic as long as they are not reused without washing
[09:24:13] <TechTest> well, let's say you get a bit excited down there
[09:24:25] <TechTest> in a speedo it would be pretty visible
[09:24:28] <kmh> but actual swimmers usually prefer speedos
[09:24:46] <TechTest> because of franction
[09:25:14] <TechTest> they also shave their entire body
[09:25:55] <kmh> ever seen mark spitz?
[09:26:07] <TechTest> no

[16:07:52] <spruit11> Sexist or money? Or both.  Or maybe even neither.  But probably both.
[16:09:13] <spruit11> You could make the case somewhere in a distance that women need to be taught that it's fine to objectify themselves but it isn't one I would defend.
[16:09:52] <spruit11> It's probably mostly money.
[16:10:09] <spruit11> Sex sells.
[16:11:55] <spruit11> It's the same with some cosplayers turned erotic model.  I ended up half hapardly supporting their choice but yah.

[18:03:17] <spruit11> You can always invert everything in power dynamics.  I remember seeing a full-blown burka somewhere in Germany.  Actually quite pretty.  But it's also easy to read that as 'I am modest,  and that gives me more power over you.'
[18:19:38] <Ungwelian> I find that generally the people of the Middle East dress a lot more conveniently than western people.
[18:19:50] <Ungwelian> Here, it's always pants and shirt.

[18:21:32] <Ungwelian> Trousers, pants, skirts, all kinds of such clothes draw tight around the waist, which causes digestion problems.

[19:37:29] <biys> doesn't matter to me what i use.  i'm completely capable with pretty much anything
[19:38:11] <pussipupu> Apple stuff all seems way overpriced to me, but maybe I'm just skint
[19:38:31] <biys> you can'tjust look at the hardware when it comes to apple products
[19:38:36] <biys> it's the experience as well
[19:38:48] <biys> if you have multiple apple products
[19:38:52] <biys> they kind of work together really well
[19:39:13] <pussipupu> Well, I have no way to find out if the experience would be good so I'll remain agnostic
[19:39:19] <spruit11> never got the knack of debian based systems.  got introduced to Redhat somewhere around '95 and stuck with that.  I guess when you want to be more on the cutting edge Debian makes more sense
[19:41:05] <spruit11> yah,  Apple is expensive.  it's nice hardware but for 1k less most people would have a good laptop too.  and the lack of connectivity probably to make more money on peripherals is a bit annoying
[19:41:11] <spruit11> it's not a bad choice though
[19:42:31] <pussipupu> I'm not judging it as a choice for others, just saying it's not an option for me
[19:43:05] <audrey> The Apple experience? I'm not sure what that is
[19:43:15] <audrey> if it's just the fancy slick UI, then Linux can replicate that for free
[19:43:29] <audrey> if it's the "walled garden" experience, well, sure, but that seems very much a matter of taste

[19:47:37] <spruit11> you can still run all GNU tooling since it still has a BSD core,  but it is a 'walled garden'
[19:47:59] <audrey> I don't see the point in buying expensive Apple products unless it's just for the brand, TBH
[19:48:09] <spruit11> so the shift from Linux to MacOS is way more comfortable than to Windows

[20:46:26] <spruit11> still more Peterson.  started wondering whether most psychologists hold on to a form of conservatism or whether Peterson is an outlier
[20:46:42] <spruit11> he made some good points though
[20:47:45] <pussipupu> Peterson is part of a specific movement of Jungian quasi-psychologist and very much a pseudo-intellectual
[20:47:58] <pussipupu> And master of the deepity

[20:50:21] <creek> Peterson is widely regarded as a clown

[20:52:11] <arryana> woo, tea
[20:53:12] <creek> had to google "deepity," glad to see Dennett
[20:55:57] <creek> I explained this to my conversation partner in relation to the Law of Attraction. First, there is a reading of it that’s true but trivial, namely this: representing something in your mind is often instrumental to acquiring it; after all, if you represent what you want clearly, that might help you figure out how to get it. But this is no more insightful than a grandparent’s advice to
[20:55:57] <creek> plan ahead and think about your goals, and it certainly doesn’t imply anything of cosmic significance like a law of gravity.
[20:56:02] <spruit11> dunno.  sometimes he makes a good observation but more often he tangents off into absolutes
[20:56:31] <pussipupu> spruit11: q.v. deepity
[20:57:05] <pussipupu> He makes broadly accurate but trivial observations once in a while and launders them into absurd grandiose claims
[20:57:45] <creek> He's also a laughing stock about everything he says
[20:57:48] <creek> everything

[20:58:12] <creek> not merely a regular general biologist, but a *MARINE* biologist.
[20:58:19] <pussipupu> And huge swathes of people take him seriously
[20:58:31] <creek> He bullshitted his way to a PhD amongst gullible rubes, and just kept doing the same thing
[20:58:53] <creek> until he ran into actual intellectuals, sometime midway thru his PR campaign
[20:59:04] <creek> Russia wanted to make him a USA Moldbug

[21:51:26] <audrey> let's avoid personal attacks and open faced trolling about academics we dislike, eh?
[21:51:50] <audrey> Instead, let's make an effort to articulate serious criticisms.
[21:52:32] <audrey> I'm tired of the demonization - whether it be Derrida or Peterson or DiAngelo

[21:54:04] <audrey> I don't care if you love him or if you hate him but you've got to come up with a more intelligent criticism than "turd".
[21:54:16] <audrey> This is exactly the sort of mentality which is toxic to philosophy in general, and ##philosophy the channel.
[21:54:45] <audrey> Better yet, if he's really that awful, don't dignify him with your attention or words
[21:56:24] <plankers> oooh i have a serious criticism of diangelo

[22:04:57] <creek> you cant fight racism except 1 on 1
[22:05:06] <creek> the way to fight racism is to physically assault racists
[22:05:22] <plankers> kicked for trolling in one channel, right on to the next, eh?
[22:05:30] <spruit11> happens in my country too.  what I view as right-wing conservatism in left-wing media
[22:06:01] <creek> "trolling" is when you dont get the joke, plankers
[22:06:24] <spruit11> maybe that was always true.  that a bunch of liberals were closet conservatists

[22:07:18] <plankers> spruit11 the rest of the world accurately identifies liberals as right wing
[22:07:34] <plankers> for some reason because theyre left of american conservatives we consider them "the left"
[22:07:38] <creek> American sociologist Amy Bruckman accurately identified the pattern of behaviior
[22:07:47] <plankers> but uh, the global identification is accurate in this case
[22:08:05] <spruit11> oh right.  yes.  I agree.  I consider someone like Biden right-wing too
[22:08:53] <spruit11> at best pragmatist liberal but then what
[22:09:11] <plankers> the american moral compass points inward
[22:09:22] <plankers> there is no direction but power
[22:10:03] <spruit11> I have no idea.  I only have what comes from there from media.
[22:14:41] <spruit11> but it is actually true.  there's an abudance of right-wing views among people who think of themselves as left-wing too

[22:16:31] <econo> in the US people who are center-left/centrist don't typically consider themselves on the Left
[22:16:35] <krb> modern tv seem to be a good way to get people to accept various races
[22:17:58] <spruit11> maybe,  I don't watch TV anymore.  it used to be humanist and it maybe sometimes still is,  but I consider it mostly pulp these days
[22:18:38] <spruit11> I just watch the news maybe listen to some radio.  less intrusive without pictures
[22:19:53] <krb> like how tv news normally is about showing drama and the same things over and over again. about how bad war supposedly is, or how modern education is about showing dates and names instead of going into details about philosophies, they only talk about war and not the whys, just to make people tired of the ideas of war and think they would be better if they wouldn't do it
[22:21:13] <pussipupu> I like competitions based on interesting skills, mostly the UK ones
[22:21:19] <krb> i think the next step would be to remove national pride altogether, and make people a little more global oriented

[22:21:36] <audrey> creek: I'm afraid this is not an ideal channel for incitement to violence
[22:21:37] <krb> and not have competitions about national borders
[22:21:40] <audrey> So let's move on, eh
[22:21:40] <krb> like flags and such
[22:21:40] <pussipupu> Great Pottery Throwdown, Great British Thowing Bee, that sort of thing

[22:23:26] <pussipupu> Throwing bees is probably ill-advised
[22:24:06] <pussipupu> I've also enjoyed a glass blowing thing from(IIRC) Canadia, but it's too melodramatic and hyper-competative for my tastes really
[22:25:26] <spruit11> even what used to be 'critical' left-wing television now often is just a format.  some take about how wrong everything is going accompanied with melodramatic music. yah sure.
[22:26:32] <spruit11> it still beats what I see from other countries often,  but not that interested anymore
[22:28:59] <pussipupu> What's the “non-other” country in this context?
[22:31:01] <pussipupu> I can't keep track of where people are based or from
[22:33:56] <spruit11> Netherlands
[22:34:55] <pussipupu> Ah right, never had the pleasure
[22:35:06] <pussipupu> Though I've been in the airspace many times
[22:35:28] <spruit11> it's like all countries.  pretty okay except for the people
[22:35:57] <spruit11> that's a joke.  I actually have it well
[22:39:17] <spruit11> turning the TV off is actually common these days here.  me,  my ex,  my children,  my last neighbour.  a substantial part of the population just isn't that interested anymore
[22:39:26] <spruit11> it's a minority though
[22:55:12] <arryana> have you seen 'the repair shop'?
[22:55:17] <arryana> that show is awesome
[22:55:42] <pussipupu> I've not but it sounds like it could be good
[22:55:47] <arryana> oooh
[22:55:56] <arryana> i -love- the chick who is an expert on old leather
[22:55:57] <arryana> she's amazing
[22:56:00] <pussipupu> Are the people in it lovely?
[22:56:04] <arryana> yes
[22:56:10] <arryana> they're so gentle and creative
[22:56:32] <arryana> they're touchingly deferential with people's beloved tattered things
[22:56:45] <pussipupu> OK, sounds good then, I'll see if we can find it
[22:56:47] <arryana> i want to grow up to do what they do
