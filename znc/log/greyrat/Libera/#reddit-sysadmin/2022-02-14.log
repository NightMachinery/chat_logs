[13:23:02] <monr0e> I tend to put lineage on all my phones thesse days
[13:23:15] <teh_f4ll3n> the app is not a provider service, so they're not allowed to install it
[13:23:17] <Activ8> facebook uninstallable? then you are buying the wrong kind of phone
[13:23:23] <CableNinja> from the MFG, it wont have it, but the provider gets it, puts their own rom on it which is full of bloat
[13:23:50] <monr0e> My only issue with my current install is that the radio driver is a US one, so I get really shitty reception
[13:23:52] <Activ8> in the UK that would be illegal as well.  Phones have to come unlocked and stock.

[13:32:04] <Activ8> our contracts are getting more expensive as well because the prices of phones keep going up
[13:32:17] <Activ8> teh_f4ll3n no
[13:32:22] <Activ8> doesn't work like that
[13:33:00] <CableNinja> Activ8, yeah I think I paid like $600 for my phone, idk, I dont remember, but either way it was hard to make that purchase, even being money-comfortable
[13:33:44] <Activ8> I got an iphone 8 back when it come out on a contract, 2 years I paid £34 a month.  After that I change to a monthly sim only plan
[13:33:50] <teh_f4ll3n> I paid $300 for a Oneplus 5 several years ago. Unlocked, stock ROM
[13:33:52] <CableNinja> I didnt even want a new phone but my bank was like 'you gotta upgrade your phone or you cant use the app anymore'
[13:34:00] <Activ8> I pay £7 a month (about 8-9$) for a sim only plan
[13:34:19] <Activ8> I still use my ip8 and I'm about to replace the battery with a new screen protector and case.
[13:34:40] <Activ8> teh_f4ll3n good price
[13:34:42] <CableNinja> hm, you just made me realize I could probably get my phone bill knocked down.

[13:35:43] <Activ8> needed to keep the phone as my number was tied to all my 2fa accounts
[13:35:52] <Activ8> didn't want to port my number over I got a new number
[13:35:54] <teh_f4ll3n> and if you want to go all the way conspiracy nut, top up with cash at news agents
[13:36:23] <Activ8> If I look at my useage I send about 600-800 texts a month
[13:36:29] <Activ8> calls about 100 mins per month

[13:44:02] <teh_f4ll3n> I've never broken/cracked a phone

[13:50:26] <SirSceptalot> just get yourself a nophone air and be done with it
[13:50:28] <Activ8> that's because people where willing to purchase the latest devices at super inflated prices, the more the consumer purchased the more the companies bluffed
[13:51:00] <Activ8> integration of different communication platforms on phones as well changed things, i.e social media
[13:51:15] <BWMerlin> I know the phone companies have noticed that people are no longer yearly upgrading
[13:51:31] <BWMerlin> I have a Mate 20, I think my next phone will be the Mate 50
[13:51:43] <BWMerlin> Get that chinese spyware phone
[13:52:39] <Activ8> I personally thing the phones should be module upgradable they would make money that way if they could sell genuine parts

[16:02:29] <fritzwastaken> Lol
[16:03:51] <estranger> wife wants solar.. I'm meh about it
[16:04:22] <Telgareith> PV solar is much more pratical
[16:04:27] <Telgareith> this is a fun science project
[16:04:38] <Telgareith> if the salt didn't get you
[16:04:56] <Telgareith> the central point of the solar thermal generator will be hot enough to melt salt
[16:06:01] <Telgareith> If you're in a cold climate you can get PV cells with water heating on the backside iirc
[16:06:26] <Telgareith> so the 80% of light that it just absorbs as heat you get to use to heat your house

[16:06:36] <SirSceptalot> jesus that seems like such an obvious idea

[16:07:20] <Telgareith> lol
[16:11:42] <estranger> yeh it's not cheap, even with all the pricing schemes to get it installed for "free"
[16:12:06] <estranger> "but we'll be making money!"
[16:12:25] <estranger> shut up wife, not with how much electricity you use 
[16:15:39] <koollman> estranger: you might be spending less money, at least, depending on the pricing scheme, location and local energy costs
[16:16:38] <estranger> to make up the $30k?
[16:16:46] <koollman> estranger: yes
[16:17:36] <estranger> I don't spend 30k in a decade, hail will prob wreck it by then :p
[16:17:39] <koollman> SirSceptalot: thermal energy is kind of hard to store/move, so it costs a lot and is harder on a small scale (some typical exceptions : pre-warming water in thermal tubes, much cheaper than photovoltaic and can be profitable in many places)
[16:18:13] <estranger> and that's assuming the panels cover 100% which they wont
[16:18:58] <koollman> as I said, depends on location and financing specifics :)
[16:19:10] <estranger> it's a loooong term play
[16:19:36] <koollman> in usa I'm fairly sure there are plans that are 'guaranteed' (not really but close enough) to be zero-cost long term investments, in some states and conditions
[16:20:32] <estranger> if I want a zero cost investment I'll put cash under my bed... at least it's liquid (even if losing money via inflation)
[16:20:42] <koollman> estranger: that's not zero cost :)
[16:20:59] <koollman> you're pretty much guaranteed to lose value unless paper becomes rare ;)
[16:21:16] <estranger> so the garentee you are talking about takes into account inflation?
[16:21:19] <estranger> doubt it.
[16:21:19] <koollman> yes
[16:21:43] <estranger> interesting, but still I'm meh about it
[16:22:06] <koollman> fixed amount of credit to reimburse versus rising cost of energy makes for some pretty safe investments
[16:23:32] <estranger> the tech is getting better though, still steep for low gains a
[16:23:34] <koollman> some companies can make a credit plan based on your current energy spendings
[16:24:40] <koollman> it's steep if you buy it at once with no financng plan. it can be ok with other options  (terms and condition may apply, obviously ;) )
[16:25:19] <estranger> it's still steep even if spread out
[16:25:45] <koollman> not if the spreading makes it go below your energy budget
[16:25:54] <estranger> 30k now or 30k spread over 20 years is still 30k
[16:26:19] <estranger> I get it
[16:26:22] <koollman> definitely. but you are spending money each year on energy, wether or not you buy that

[16:28:07] <koollman> but it is usually safe to consider that you will spend some amount on energy, then decide if having part of that amount go toward one thing versus another and see how it looks on 10 or 20 years
[16:28:31] <estranger> wife wants it so we have power when the main is cut... apparently it doesn't work that way heh
[16:28:51] <koollman> it is more expensive to make it work that way in general (for good reasons)
[16:28:59] <estranger> rather spend 10k on a genny which I'd need anyhow
[16:29:05] <koollman> or you can have some 'generator equivalent' system
[16:29:19] <koollman> but, yeah, not the same concept/systems
[16:29:23] <estranger> more I read about batteries the less I want one
[16:29:36] <koollman> well, they are nice, but the usage is different
[16:29:51] <estranger> get a natgas genny that can convert to diesel, and be done
[16:30:24] <koollman> if you want power without grid, batteries are quite useful. if you want to just save money, batteries aren't as useful, and can be completely optional
[16:31:28] <estranger> not to sound like a dick but I don't care about making 30k over a decade either in an optimal solar setup
[16:31:41] <koollman> I can completely understand that
[16:31:50] <estranger> I'll prob end up with panels anyhow heh
[16:31:59] <estranger> and a Genny

[18:03:19] <fritzwastaken> oh cool
[18:03:57] <Disconnect> That was my most useless. Nobody had tags at the time (even on android.) Back int he days of the 'samsung tag' before flag-dayed themselves in the face
[18:04:12] <Disconnect> er, nobody had NFC readers I mean
[18:05:29] <PattyCakes> well it's amazing now lol
[18:05:33] <Disconnect> I stuck one in the car for automation though. Turned off the lights, set various "away from home" settings, activated the 'notifier' (ping phone when sensors open or close) etc. It was almost as convenient as just letting the geofence work
[18:05:57] <PattyCakes> When I redo my driveway, I'm putting in some form of smart "gate" controller
[18:06:12] <PattyCakes> kinda like at your work, where you pull up to the gate with a tag and the gate opens
[18:06:23] <PattyCakes> yea well mine will run automation when a known car pulls over the gate reader
[18:07:10] <PattyCakes> and I'm going to have some way to track where the cars are, for example, if a known car pulls in the driveway and doesn't go into the backyard garage, only the front door lights will turn on
[18:07:24] <PattyCakes> if known car drives through the gate into the backyard, the back lights will turn on

[18:07:39] <Disconnect> break-beam sensors would probably do it easily enough
[18:07:52] <PattyCakes> yea, it'll be a combination of sensors
[18:08:10] <PattyCakes> that's like step 947 of my evil take over the world plan
[18:08:13] <Disconnect> The known car is the challenge but you could just geofence it to your device and go from there. "There is a car here, the device just arrived, maybe these are associated"
[18:08:14] <PattyCakes> and right now, I'm on step like 12
[18:08:33] <PattyCakes> I'm thinking I build a GPS and high frequency range NFC transmitter into an arduino or rpi
[18:08:37] <PattyCakes> and do something that way
[18:08:59] <fritzwastaken> just rework an electric dog fence
[18:09:00] <PattyCakes> but like I said, so far down the list on things to do :(
[18:09:02] <fritzwastaken> reverse it
[18:09:27] <Disconnect> Once you've got gps on a device, just slap it with a real radio (wifi or whatever, even iot loran if you have enough land to need miles of range). Or accept that you described your phone and use that instead 🙂
[18:09:48] <PattyCakes> sadly all the "fun" things I want to do require a lot of "boring" (although I find them endlessly fun) things
[18:10:10] <PattyCakes> so I haven't even used an ounce of my brain power to even start gooingling how I want to do this
[18:10:17] <Disconnect> 100%. My week is the earlier-mentioned azure migration. Instead of adding 2 new apps to my service pile.
[18:10:35] <PattyCakes> I just know it'll be a thing, so before I pour a concrete driveway, I need tomake sure whatever I want to place IN the concrete I have planned out
[18:10:44] <PattyCakes> and the driveway is like step 300
[18:11:35] <PattyCakes> right now I'm working on modifying a garage door tilt sensor to function as a "swing" sensor
[18:11:51] <PattyCakes> so I can tell the angle of the position of my gate, and see if it's open
[18:12:54] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Good Morning 😄
[18:13:06] <fritzwastaken> Mornin @FeralTerminator
[18:13:16] <PattyCakes> so I'll have an optical beam sensor as a primary. If beam is broken, gate is probably open
[18:13:34] <PattyCakes> but sometimes something might block the sensor, so having the angle of the swing adds the 2nd layer of confirmation

[19:43:40] <Hunterkll> that's like comparing banans to apples

[19:44:21] <fritzwastaken> And by make banana ice cream, I mean smash some bananas that were going bad into vanilla ice cream
[19:44:31] <Hunterkll> right, but in our case, FIPS is literally talking about specific algorithms and such, and that's *it*
[19:44:31] <sd> 11<H​otmess> except those 2 years where uk had a gpdr but noone could read it
[19:44:32] <technonerd> banana fosters!

[19:45:41] <Disconnect> (Silver lining: FIPS forced everyone to figure out reproducable builds of things like openssl. So that is a net-good.)
[19:45:42] <Hunterkll> Disconnect: 140-2 compliance is dumb easy regardless of vendor....
[19:45:53] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so those 2 years were "we have a gpdr but none knows whats in it"
[19:46:19] <Hunterkll> Disconnect: but fun fact, y ou can't use windows FIPS mode with sharepoint 
[19:46:27] <Hunterkll> because it disables MD5 in schannel 
[19:46:39] <Hunterkll> and sharepoint uses MD5 for hashing of search result items
[19:46:55] <Hunterkll> not for any crypto usage, but for fast search indexing/hashing
[19:47:06] <Disconnect> f140-2 is simply the reproducible builds of openssl. We were fisma medium, lots more to it than just "are you using the correct hacked up openssl in your systems"
[19:47:36] <Hunterkll> Disconnect: fisma moderate is a lot more, but fips compliance / policy exception is the easy part of that

[22:05:28] <estranger> CoJaBo can I ask why?
[22:05:53] <CoJaBo> They suspended my account because I got a deposit.
[22:06:09] <estranger> from Iran? :p
[22:06:11] <CoJaBo> There is no way to get it back without waiting 30 days or more

[22:06:50] <CoJaBo> I've had this account for decades
[22:06:55] <estranger> their rules change for accounts under uhh 90 days I think
[22:07:00] <estranger> ok that's weird
[22:07:20] <Kiernian> but...but...AI is the future!
[22:07:22] <estranger> I've done large deposits there no problem

[22:08:14] <CoJaBo> estranger: Switch to another bank ASAP. I sat there for 3+ hours to get just some of my money out in cash, then still had to go to some other bank to get a usable debit card.
[22:08:40] <estranger> their risk assessment is a 3rd party system, wonder if they goofed

[22:09:30] <estranger> good news, their risk pipeline is about to change :)
[22:09:46] <CoJaBo> The deposit was unexpected, and I do not have any clear idea why the treasury sent me money. But that is no justification for them to steal all the money I previously had in the account, and disable my card for a minimum of a month
[22:10:00] <estranger> yeh that's not right
[22:10:35] <Kiernian> Not right? Shit, man, that ought to be criminal.
[22:10:42] <CoJaBo> If you have an account there, move it while there is still time. This is their standard policy.
[22:10:55] <estranger> that's not standard
[22:11:08] <CoJaBo> If you get a questioned deposit, they suspend the ENTIRE balance. They told me that is their standard.
[22:11:26] <estranger> yeh but why it's questioned is weird
[22:11:28] <Molnija> It's theft.
[22:11:30] <CoJaBo> The bank I moved to also thought that was insane.

[22:12:52] <CoJaBo> estranger: It's a large amount of small deposits that posted at the same time. But I still had money in the account that was my own, and they suspended access to all of it, not just the weird deposit.
[22:13:01] <Hunterkll> PNC's pretty good
[22:13:15] <CoJaBo> estranger: I regret not switching last time they moderately screwed me over :/
[22:13:18] <estranger> was it 5+?
[22:13:55] <CoJaBo> It was about $4,000
[22:14:05] <estranger> btw I'm not justifying, just trying to work out what happened
[22:14:17] <estranger> 5+ separate deposits I mean
[22:14:19] <CoJaBo> It looks like I later got more to bring it to $6-7,000, but the account was already suspended by that time
[22:14:26] <estranger> the amount doesn't matter
[22:14:26] <Molnija> CoJaBo: I recall reading a blogpost about this
[22:14:29] <CoJaBo> 20 or so deposits
[22:14:35] <estranger> yeah
[22:14:48] <Kiernian> ohhh. heh.
[22:14:50] <estranger> so, shouldn't suspend your account, but I think I see what happened
[22:14:51] <CoJaBo> Molnija: If you can find it, let me know
