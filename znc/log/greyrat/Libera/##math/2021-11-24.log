[01:18:02] <int-e> Guest95: So... what's the confusion? The empty set is much smaller than the set of points on the unit circle.
[01:18:15] <Guest95> Right. Lets just consider part a for the moment. What you and I wrote is the variety of the first elimination ideal: V(I_1) = {(y,z) in C^2 | y^2 + z^2 = 1}.
[01:18:15] <Guest95> Now I want to compute what pi_1(V(I))  is. I am confused on this part.
[01:18:51] <int-e> pi_1(X) = {pi_1(x) | x in X}
[01:21:09] <Guest95> What you wrote is probably equivalent to the definition in my book: https://i.imgur.com/zpuMpgk.png
[01:21:10] <Guest95> That said, I am still confused. The points in V(I_1) are called partial solutions. How do I know which of those extend to the complete solution?

[01:24:54] <Guest95> the no real solutions bit is for part (b). For part (a), I still need to write what pi_1 is

[01:47:36] <Guest95> From the first equation, we write: x^2 = -y^2 - z^2 - 2 and then plugging into the second yields: y^2 + z^2 = 1. Any points (y,z) in C^2 satisfying this equation are those in V(I_1).
[01:47:36] <Guest95> So we've...discarded the value of x?
[01:48:25] <Guest95> so is pi_1 the map defined by: x^2 = -y^2 - z^2 -2 ?
[01:48:40] <int-e> wtf, no.
[01:48:46] <int-e> pi_1((x,y,z)) = (y,z)
[01:49:39] <int-e> There's no algebraic manipulation connected to ideals in pi_1, it just maps points from R^3 to R^2.
[01:50:15] <int-e> Or from C^3 to C^2, depending on which of the two parts you're considering.

[06:35:41] <droid3> they look really similar so if i get close with the font most of these books i am look at seem to be so similar that once you find one font similar enough it look pretty much the same as all the majority of books i am look at currently.
[06:36:18] <droid3> the thing that makes them stand out differently that i am coming to the conclusion of most of these books.
[06:36:36] <droid3> is the font size and font italic/bold if used.
[06:37:21] <droid3> Most other attributes to the fonts between the group of math books i am comparing pretty much not to different
[06:38:08] <droid3> And i believe alot of case the size of fonts chosen was a choice made based on the paper size used.
[06:38:51] <droid3> So in that respect is there any formula or rule to go by interms of A paper size chosen to print on and font size???
[06:40:10] <droid3> it look sort of like an 8 to 10 range font size for smaller size books yet books that are the full 11 by 8 ish size can do probably 12 or 14 font size and look good.

[06:40:51] *** Quits: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[06:41:12] <droid3> 1) font size assuming i found/know the font i want to use.
[06:41:55] <droid3> 2) figuring out the best overall math/science book font to use for written non-math proof/symbol sections of the article/book.
[06:42:52] <droid3> I am not even sure you guys like the look of Dover Publishing math books. Maybe new generation like springer stuff or a different company like princton-hall or something.
[06:44:23] <droid3> Me i always like Dover publishing books but that just me. Springer is great to but alot of those books seem to have similar font just bigger sizes and bolder a little bit more. Mostly because there books are much larger in comparision to Dovers
[06:46:33] <droid3> So there font seems the same or very similar just because its bolder and a bigger font size it seem that it looks different to most people perhaps.
[06:47:37] <droid3> The size of font is directly proportional to how many pages you want the article/book to be taking into account the size of the paper as well that its printed on.

[06:48:30] <droid3> So its brainstorming night on math font topics. I know how to make my own fonts and import/export them into my Operating system but that seems overkill/alot of work.
[06:49:17] <droid3> So the question is what is the common fonts publishing companies use to publish science/math books (aka the non-mathematical symbol part of the book that is)

[06:50:06] <droid3> the part that one could develop in any old word processor or text editor application before he adds the math latex proofs/symbols to it.
[06:51:23] <droid3> even if most math book writters write the book completely in latex even the non-math symbols part. I see latex application not having anything different for what you could import into your word document fonts.
[06:51:42] <droid3> At this point most application should probably have all the fonts available to them

[10:50:44] <blackfield> how does that help? i*sqrt(2) has x^2+2 as minimal polynomial so [Q(i*sqrt(2)):Q]=2 for sure, but i'm rather trying to find [Q(i*sqrt(2),i*sqrt(3)):Q]=2*[Q(i*sqrt(2),i*sqrt(3)):Q(i*sqrt(2))], and here i'm not sure how to show Q(i*sqrt(2),i*sqrt(3))=/=Q(i*sqrt(2))
[10:52:09] <greenbagels> blackfield: can you show that the former has strictly larger than 2 degree?
[10:52:29] <greenbagels> has degree strictly larger than 2, if i were to use non-broken english lol
[10:57:09] <blackfield> do you mean [Q(i*sqrt(2),i*sqrt(3)):Q]>2 ? i'm not entirely sure how to show it

[15:04:57] <parazyd> The extension field can be generated from F_101 by adjoining a solution to a degree-2 polynomial that is not found in F_101.
[15:05:09] <parazyd> x^2 + 2 is irreducible in F_101 and can be used.
[15:05:56] <parazyd> So my question is, how can I have some "u" be one of the solutions to x^2 + 2, so that every element of F_101^2 can be written as a+b*u where a and b are from F_101?
[15:06:36] <parazyd> And then to have some point which is there, like (36, 31u)

[15:29:43] <andrew> Does anyone know any good, free, online complex analysis books? I plan on self-studying the subject with a friend of mine over the winter break, but we're both broke college students who can't afford anything expensive.
[15:32:39] <taeaad> How accessible should the skill level be? I avoided complex analysis by focusing on real analysis and for me it was a good move. If you are good at calculus then you can do it without the more general topology that comes out of real analysis.
[15:33:18] <taeaad> Complex analysis at the surface is advanced calculus; at the core it's about rotations and angle preserving functions.
[15:34:17] <andrew> Fairly accessible, I think. I've done more advanced courses than my friend has; I'm in intro real analysis (i.e. calculus with rigor) and she's in linear algebra this semester, if you want an idea of our relative standings.
[15:37:07] <cadmio> Z-module: yesterday you told me that: "Each 3-Sylow having order 3 means it *must* be of the for <(a b c)> since a single 3-cycle is the only type of element of order 3 in S_4" doesn't this imply what I asked before?
[15:37:18] <taeaad> Maybe someone else can recommend standard texts. My approach is to study the abstract algebra that in some sense leads to complex analysis.

[17:49:26] <ertiportline> Ok, let me digest for a second.
[17:49:55] <[itchyjunk]> when you have physics as a hammer, maybe everything looks like statistical inference :D
[17:51:23] <johnkeats7> ertiportline, the intuition is: the flow of X allows you to push vectors along it. you push W, Z along for time t, compute their inner product (according to g at that new point), and see how this changes
[17:52:14] <johnkeats7> so if the flow of X tends to preserve inner products you get 0, and if it tends to change them a lot you get a big number

[21:19:57] <isekaijin> Then obviously the projection from [0,1] x [0,1] to either factor sends X to a compact set.

[21:21:30] <isekaijin> Are there any reasonable conditions, significantly weaker than “X is the graph of a continuous self-bijection [0,1] -> [0,1]”, that guarantee that X is compact?
[21:21:44] <tomtomgps> Hi, I have to show that linear temporal logic formulas are tauotologies.  The first formula is FGp => GFp  where p \in AP.  I belive this is a taurtology because if we have finally globally p it means that after a certain rank we always have p. So that means  for every rank we can always find a bigger rank so thatw e have p
[21:22:11] <tomtomgps> is this correct ?
[21:24:19] <johnkeats7> isekaijin, this is topology, all functions are at least continuous
[21:24:20] <Z-module> Hmmm, I kinda think X compact => the map is continuous.

[23:45:25] <droid3> one more question on latex. Is when latex/tex was invented in like 60 or 70 ish what did they do for publishing math/science books before then. Because those books still had abilities to embed math symbols decently well. So how they do it before latex/tex.
[23:45:50] <Z-module> actual professional typesetters
[23:46:09] <droid3> And why couldnt you do it like back then if you didnt know latex/tex very well to write the whole thing in.

[23:46:26] <oni^> *hands
[23:47:16] <droid3> so somebody just took either pictures of somebodies blackboard/whiteboard or somebody actually had physical typesetters do it out by hand the latex/tex.
[23:48:15] <droid3> Hummm this begs the question why isnt latex/tex part of regular word processor fonts /typesets why is it a whole other can of worms to learn aka new tex editor instead of word process
[23:48:46] <droid3> It just seems latex/tex gets much more complex then a typical word process written novel
[23:49:05] <johnkeats6> in milnor's morse theory book the pictures are hand drawn
[23:49:37] <CuriousErnestBro> Hash 7 digits, 7^10
[23:49:46] <droid3> As you maybe aware i am trying to figure out a good way to write math books without having to be a power user/master of latex/tex editors.
[23:49:47] <CuriousErnestBro> uhhh 10^7
[23:50:06] <CuriousErnestBro> 10 million people per area code
[23:50:20] <Ethos> droid3 why?
[23:50:34] *** Quits: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex) (Quit: = "")
[23:51:07] <droid3> most non-science/math nonlatex/tex based books such as novels ,fiction ,...etc seem to just be written with a regular word process like ms word and such and publishing companies just except the generated cover pdf and pdf of the internals of written book.
[23:51:08] <Hash> I got it
[23:51:11] <Hash> Sorry
[23:51:12] <Hash> I mis thought
[23:51:16] <Hash> It's 10**10
[23:51:21] <riv> no Hash it was a good question
[23:51:40] <Hash> Awesome, thanks my friend
[23:51:44] <Hash> I gotta go study :)
[23:51:54] <droid3> But i was curious latex/tex based books such as math and science are a whole other can of worms if you have to know /learn a latex/tex editor
[23:52:23] <Z-module> It's less, really, since an areacode can't start with 0 or 1, and pretty sure an exchange can't start with 0
[23:52:54] <droid3> I was thinking the only way to get around this is to write it like any other novel aka in a word process then just generate latex/tex statements as images and embed the images in the word document. Then just generate the pdf for them.
[23:53:26] <droid3> That gets me not having to learn latex/tex editors.
[23:54:30] <droid3> However is that except-able because i can see the issue if the font of the picture didnt look close enough to the word processor font before you generated the image for it.
[23:54:35] <mornfall> books are not done in word processors
[23:54:39] <Ethos> ^
[23:54:47] <Ethos> I would just learn a bit of latex, isn't that hard.
[23:54:57] <droid3> Or if the image had to be enlarged loosing resolution quality when printing.

[23:55:04] <biberao> hi
[23:55:09] <Ethos> And there are lot of books published in tex with the source code avalaible.
[23:55:53] <mornfall> it's probably less work to do the typesetting in latex than making it produce cropped pictures of your math
[23:55:56] <droid3> No latex isnt hard to generate a few equation for but whole 100 page documents and multipage stuff latex to me is an issue because the layout get screwed up/have issue more with layout...etc then the equation
[23:56:49] <mornfall> latex gets screwy with floats; unfortunately, so do word processors, and basically every other software
[23:56:58] <mornfall> that's probably because floats are inherently screwy
[23:56:59] <droid3> so sure i can generate latex line by line but more then that is complex for me i run into issues.

[23:58:29] <droid3> I think all just do the document and a word processor program like most other nonscience/math book would be done in. And just have to be careful in generating the latex math equation images with the right font and size to embed in the math book.

[23:59:07] <droid3> Curious can you generate .svg files for latex that way the resizing of them wont be an issue if you can embed svg into word document/word process applications ????
[23:59:13] <droid3> that my other thought
