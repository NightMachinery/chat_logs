[02:10:28] <skye0> been thinking of getting a van or a truck though. off-grid living appeals to me a little but at the same time my projects require such a consistent source of energy and connection it'll be difficult to realize
[02:10:42] <skye0> will need a car that can haul lots of shit though when i get my driving license
[02:17:13] <joepie91> you can get pretty far with solar panels, a sat/cellular link, and a remote server
[02:17:22] <unfinity> ・ ​ ゜゜・。。・゜゜\​_o< QU​ACK!
[02:17:25] <joepie91> ,bef
[02:17:25] <unfinity> joepie91 you befriended a duck in 3.168 seconds! You have made friends with 221 ducks in #datahoarder.
[02:17:40] <ThePendulum> higher upfront cost, and some maintenance tasks will take more effort than in a house/apartment, like cleaning out the septic t ank
[02:17:43] <ThePendulum> -' '
[02:18:19] <ThePendulum> but yeah if you're not claustrophobic it's an option
[02:19:19] <ThePendulum> but it might not be significantly cheaper than an apartment of similar size
[02:20:05] <ThePendulum> new vans are expensive as fuck, affordable vans will need a lot of work which and is only really doable if you don't mind being your own mechanic
[02:20:52] <ThePendulum> there's a little coke mirror stuck in the ceiling of a campervan somewhere
[02:21:24] <skye0> i'm a bit spoiled with some on-grid comforts, but yeah, it is something that vagueely interests me
[02:21:25] <ThePendulum> I lended it to someone to fix some wiring, they closed the panel forgetting about it, then sold the van before either of us realized where it went
[02:22:32] <skye0> it's currently way out of my reach. i did buy a survival kit though that i'm using for emergencies, but i don't have very good survival skills if i somehow were stuck in the woods
[02:22:34] <ThePendulum> I'm guessing you'd be comfortable living in the country side then anyway? small apartments outside of the city can be pretty cheap
[02:23:07] <skye0> i'm ok with being in the city and where I am. it's just small and expensive. the biggest thing i'll hate about living in the country is how it'll be so damn hard to remain anonymous
[02:23:25] <skye0> otherwise i think games like dayz inspired me to get into survival a little bit
[02:23:39] <ThePendulum> I figured there aren't really many places you can park a van and live from it in the city, at least not legally
[02:23:58] <ThePendulum> and you'll need somewhere to empty and fill the tanks
[02:24:52] <ThePendulum> I guess if you're cheeky you could dump it in a sewer grill, but then you need water
[02:25:53] <skye0> mmhm
[02:30:07] <ThePendulum> the urge to move out has really been getting to me lately
[02:30:36] <ThePendulum> for a long while I had this idea that my parents moved out as late as 27, so they can't comment
[02:30:49] <ThePendulum> then I suddenly turned 26 and pressure's building quickly >.>
[02:43:26] <skye0> i'm 24. i'm barely in a good position to do so. might as well sort out driving and transitioning first though i guess. came across someone who chose to live with their mother at 30 though but she's on good terms with her mother
[02:47:59] <ThePendulum> I do wonder about transitioning, I get that it's a big deal but in part that also makes me wonder if maybe you should be in a better place so you have a clear head to make sure you have a clear picture and full control over the trajectory. bit of a vicious cycle though
[02:49:28] <skye0> yeah. hopefully i can discuss that too. it'll be pricey too because i plan to go private for that.
[02:49:39] <ThePendulum> I mean I don't have much to compare it to so all I can think of is whether I would get kids right now or something, moving out is such a big change that I want to get to know myself as I've moved out before doing something big and permanent like that

[21:10:03] <rawktucc> ok
[21:10:07] <rawktucc> mergerfs actually sucks shit
[21:10:22] <rawktucc> I'm reading a bunch of files to push remotely, from the merge pool
[21:10:29] <rawktucc> im trying to read a single video file while doing this... 300KB/s
[21:10:44] <rawktucc> if I mount the remote server over sshfs, I can read literally half my max download speed...
[21:10:53] <rawktucc> so I'm streaming the video remotely despite having the file locally
[21:11:17] <rawktucc> im gonna have to do individual drive transfers to fully maximize transfer speeds now, going local to remote
