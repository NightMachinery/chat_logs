[09:10:06] <ejjfunky> amigojapan, i've thought of it. basically, if we can do a real simple specification where you can use diy arduino device as your peer to peer wifi, that would cut the cost, i think.
[09:10:06] <absentia> that is almost an oxymoron
[09:10:10] <ProfSimm> absentia: well in effect it encodes a statement in a procedural language, the function it returns is the next statement, and the commnads are the effects it produces

[10:33:32] <blahboybaz> A loop that was used in a lesson (freeCodeCamp challenge) seems link an intersting case. If i = 1 and i is incrmented by 2 but the loop stops at 4 then the loop executes twice (once on 1 and once on 3). How does the interpreter know that it can't get one more loop out of i before it has to end? On the last iteration, does it also evaluate the increment argument before deciding to quit?

[10:35:16] <blahboybaz> In other words, a for loop evaluates the first arg, compares it against the second arg, then executes the third arg (in that order) - right? So what happens on the last iteration when you hit 3? Does it still evaluate the third arg to find out that if it executes one more time it will go beyond the stop condition?
[10:35:25] <ent58> going completely free-wheel here, each step in interpreting/executing that code is done in vacuum
[10:35:34] <ent58> so there's no look ahead
[10:35:39] <ent58> it's completely seat of the pants
[10:36:06] <blahboybaz> The loop stops when it's supposed to - I just wonder how
[10:36:45] <ent58> because after every call to console.log()
[10:36:58] <ent58> an independent comparison is done on 'i'
[10:37:01] <ejjfunky> blahboybaz, it's all in the i <= 4
[10:37:27] <ent58> is i <= 4? yes, console.log()
[10:37:40] <ent58> is i <= 4? yes, console.log()

[10:38:59] <ent58> and concentionally yes i would be 5 if it's not out of scope and destroyed
[10:39:02] <blahboybaz> So the loop evaluates all the args a third time (where if it did execute the stop condition would become 5) but it doesn't actually enter the code block to execute anythign - instead it just terminates

[21:01:38] <adder`> oldlaptop, is it as simple as "it's slower to index into a bigger table"?

[21:02:06] <oldlaptop> I would expect, offhand, all the cache on a modern CPU to be "high-grade static RAM" (if you mean SRAM as opposed to DRAM)
[21:02:12] <GeDaMo> Faster caches use more transistors, I believe
[21:02:29] <oldlaptop> It's not necessarily "the speed of light" so much as propagation delay through the logic

[21:03:11] <oldlaptop> although just propagation through wires adds up too at the insanely small timescales that are relevant

[23:23:44] <deniska> `for i, item in enumerate(items)` is a common idiom in python if you actually need an index
[23:24:01] <deniska> but it turns out you don't need an index more often than you do
[23:24:15] <deniska> so the default is `for item in items`
