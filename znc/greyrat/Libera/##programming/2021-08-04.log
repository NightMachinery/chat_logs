[00:54:20] <pyzozord> yeah generally I'm not really invested enough in the details to have an opinion if systemd is good or bad. I know Ubuntu is using it, but I don't really have any way to compare with anything else since that's all I know. I interact with it sometimes by systemctl to turn off or on some service and with journalctl, but that's it

[02:36:37] <Arahael> pyzozord: The history of what is, and what isn't, classified as third-world is an interesting exploration of politics, and the term has changed _considerably_.  Worth looking into it.

[02:37:02] <Arahael> I generally regard third world as *non-western*, these days.

[03:12:01] <ITD4004> before the "P3" header part all the data contains whatever 16-bit instructions you can get

[04:38:24] <vdamewood> 'occulting' isn't a word in English, and the word 'occult' draws up imagry of the devil and demons and necromancy and such in English. Do you mean 'hiding'?

[04:41:15] <causative_> soulisson, between "a" and "b" it doesn't really matter, but ideally you should not have a function whose job it is to do *two* things - one function should do *one* thing
[04:41:19] <vdamewood> soulisson: The programming term is 'encapsulation', and we tend to like to hide details from the user.
[04:41:44] <causative_> so if your function is doing those two things, *in order to achieve* a single goal, the description should say what the single goal is
[04:43:34] <causative_> although it can also be useful to include a little information in the description of how the goal is implemented
[04:43:35] <soulisson> causative_, I was thinking for instance about a function that would be used to open a file, read it, decrypt it, and display it. open, read, decrypt would be implemented in other functions but called from this single function

[06:57:17] <PlanckWalk> I can guess that the object will probably be at position X + V dT
[06:57:20] <PlanckWalk> It*
[06:57:41] <PlanckWalk> Without having all the collision code and force vectors of a full physics update.
[06:57:50] <smallville7123> ok
[06:58:09] <PlanckWalk> It can only be slightly wrong since the physics engine will very soon tell it the real position.
[06:58:13] <smallville7123> and would it be modifying the object's X itself?
[06:58:42] <smallville7123> or would it be modifying a temporary X that is saved from the last X from the last update?
[06:59:50] <smallville7123> eg draw(object.customX(estimatedX));
[07:00:27] <smallville7123> in which object's actual X is not modified but instead `estimatedX` is used in place of the actual X
[07:01:06] <PlanckWalk> Right, it wouldn't update the world state at all.  It just uses an estimated position.
[07:01:15] <smallville7123> ok

[07:33:48] <PlanckWalk> If the hardware is *really* weak, then there might not be enough resources to run the updates at the target rate, but there's not much you can do about that.  I wouldn't even try to "catch up" unless it's a multiplayer network game.
[07:34:33] <smallville7123> and if it is a network game?

[07:34:50] <PlanckWalk> If it's just display FPS dropping to 5, that shouldn't affect updates at all.
[07:35:08] <smallville7123> or rather, if i want to support being able to create multiplayer network games?
[07:35:10] <PlanckWalk> If it's a multiplayer network game, then you have a whole new parcel of synchronization issues to address :)

[07:35:57] <smallville7123> yea
[07:36:05] <PlanckWalk> For one thing most of the updates will be done at the server end.

[07:38:31] <PlanckWalk> So the clients probably won't even have a world update loop, and probably not enough information to do one anyway.
[07:39:25] <PlanckWalk> So you don't have the issue fo having draw FPS not equalling update rate. Instead you have billions more issues to address.
[07:39:53] <causative_> well, that depends on the type of game - if it's an RTS it may use lockstep simulation, so that every client runs exactly the same simulation
[07:39:53] <PlanckWalk> (Okay I exaggerrate.  It's probably only thousands of extra issues.)

[07:41:16] <causative_> lockstep sim prevents cheating by sending only the player actions, not the full state
[07:41:16] <PlanckWalk> It's pretty hard to do lockstep simulation when 90% of the world state is hidden from the client. How is that usually managed?
[07:41:36] <PlanckWalk> I suppose by having very heavily decoupled state
[07:41:48] <causative_> well, ok, it is possible for clients to cheat by seeing through fog of war
[07:41:53] <causative_> but not by altering the game state
[07:42:33] <causative_> some RTS games try to make fog of war cheating ("maphacking") harder, by forcing clients to run spyware that makes sure they are not using any known cheating tools while the game is running

[12:36:45] <mrig> Hello :)
[12:37:26] <mrig> Oh having the text in xml between text tags and between other tags as the same type is really nasty :|
[12:37:51] <kmh> ok
[12:37:58] <mrig> I'm not sure if this is standard for an xml lib or particular to the one that I'm using.
[12:38:41] <mrig> The bugs that it generates are really subtle.
[12:39:39] <mrig> well interesting to see anyhow.

[12:41:10] <mrig> Becomes clearer why the html parser rejects all formatting when seen in this way.
[12:41:48] <mrig> the text is different between a token and its content.
[12:42:01] <mrig> the tags are no longer text once lexed.
[12:42:49] <mrig> The in between tags token is the same for both between text tokens and between any other tokens.
[12:43:11] <mrig> The xml package is a pretty basic one, this might be why.

[12:48:04] <mrig> the tail for file formatting info, that sort of thing?

[15:29:50] <beaky> so for example if you have a tree a := leaf | node a (tree a) (tree a) then the fold of that would be to take the entire tree and replace all the leaves with something of your choice and all of the nodes with another thing of your choice
[15:31:08] <beaky> and if you want to encode the tree using visitor you can use two different functions that both takes those function on the leaves and the function on the nodes, one of them runs the one on the leaves and the other runs the one on the tree nodes (and its children, thus the iteration part)

[16:14:15] <CoderGuy> so the point is, if you're going to make Augmented Reality for those who didn't understand, then like be aware that others might do it first
[16:14:25] <oldlaptop> CoderGuy: However old you think VR and "AR" are, they're probably older than that.
[16:14:31] <CoderGuy> oh of course
[16:14:41] <CoderGuy> i'm just saying it was interesting to see how others caught onto my way of thinking
[16:14:56] <oldlaptop> (And whatever idea you think you had first was probably tried fifteen years ago)
[16:15:00] <CoderGuy> cuz that was one of my paths, now I just do what I know even if you did it you can't take it from me
[16:15:03] <oldlaptop> (or more)
[16:15:09] <CoderGuy> fifteen years ago, is not far enough
[16:15:28] <scaleww> CoderGuy, there is much more to succeeding in something than just an idea ;)
[16:15:33] <CoderGuy> yeah exactly
[16:15:37] <oldlaptop> I guess that's still this century. That's hard to believe.
[16:15:41] <CoderGuy> so I focus on my strengths like AR woulda been cool but it's not my strength

[16:17:21] <CoderGuy> well most AR is done with phones today
[16:18:02] <CoderGuy> hard to do something without a device, but smart phones gave us access to so much
[16:18:43] <Arahael> Phones are such a clunky mechanism.  Before phones, people were looking at it using other devices, such as glasses.
[16:18:43] <CoderGuy> like unless you're Apple idk how you convince people to buy a device strictly for AR, but if they have a phone that supports AR well now you can just offer the app in an app store

[16:19:25] <CoderGuy> again these are cool concepts

[16:22:11] <CoderGuy> I like how this works array[0] <-- this gets me the data at array[0];   But lets say I wanted to achieve this functionality just not have my class as an array is there a good way to do this?
[16:22:32] <bjs> CoderGuy: what language are you using?
[16:22:44] <GeDaMo> Like mydata.get(0) ?
[16:22:49] <bjs> in some languages `x[i]` is some fixed built-in behaviour only for arrays you can't change
[16:22:49] <CoderGuy> javascript currently but I want to be able to do it in c#
[16:22:56] <CoderGuy> GeDaMo, exactly like that
[16:23:01] <bjs> in others you can customise what that means so that `x` can be something other than an array
[16:23:03] <CoderGuy> but I want mydata[0] instead
[16:23:23] <GeDaMo> That's a syntax thing, I don't know if C# allows you to override []
[16:23:49] <CoderGuy> hmm yeah if I can't do it in c# I guess I won't, sucks man I really like how it works
[16:23:52] <bjs> CoderGuy: is http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6x16t2tx.aspx what you wanted?

[16:26:07] <DnzAtWrk> WHO EXPECTS THE FUNCTION ARGUMENTS TO CHANGE BETWEEN VERSIONS
[16:26:11] <CoderGuy> ohhh so the data is internal to the class SampleCollection cuz if so yes exactly this
[16:26:18] <DnzAtWrk> who even reads up on release notes of all the software they use
[16:26:25] <DnzAtWrk> and not just use the latest version
[16:26:28] <Akronymus> Tbh, I started to expect such breaking changes DnzAtWrk
[16:26:31] <CoderGuy> bjs, is this something both java and C# can achieve along with maybe python?
[16:26:36] <bjs> CoderGuy: I think the array is just for demonstration,  you don't nee the array you can do whatever you want
[16:26:59] <CoderGuy> right but I want the behaviour of stringCollection[0] or stringCollection[1]  but I want the data to be internal
[16:27:03] <bjs> CoderGuy: Python can,  Java doesn't really let you "overload" operators, it prefers you make methods.

[16:27:46] <CoderGuy> just cuz like an array doesn't array[0] actually point to the data?
[16:28:09] <CoderGuy> whereas in this example stringCollection[1] points to the get method which then grabs from the internal data and returns it

[16:28:19] <bjs> CoderGuy: well x[i] is just some syntax that (in Python and C#) calls some code/method on the object. For an array it returns the data at index i
[16:28:25] <bjs> if you overload it, it can do whatever you want
[16:28:26] <DnzAtWrk> "GDAL 3 honours now by default CRS axis order"
[16:28:27] <DnzAtWrk> hurr
[16:28:30] <GeDaMo> As long as you can convert the index into the element you want in the internal collection
[16:28:54] <CoderGuy> yeah GeDaMo the example listed from bjs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/ does exactly what I want
[16:28:56] <Akronymus> You can use the brackets to retrieve data out of a dictionary or hashmap if you want to.

[16:34:02] <Akronymus> Yeah, "something universal" is very hard to impossible.
[16:34:13] <CoderGuy> it's either that or I rewrite it for Java

[16:41:42] *** Joins: zaher (~zaher@37.48.148.5)
[16:42:04] <CoderGuy> oh I see, it calls keys() or some internal method to give it something to iterate over
[16:42:15] <Akronymus> I think foreach in java gives a mutable reference to a function passed to it.
[16:42:19] <CoderGuy> yeah
[16:42:25] <Akronymus> Specifically for hashtable.
[16:42:33] <Akronymus> Didn't look up other scenarios.
[16:42:36] <CoderGuy> hmmm
[16:42:47] <bjs> CoderGuy: each language has its own design, and Java decided to be "simpler" by not letting you overload the operators
[16:42:50] <Akronymus> While in c#, foreach gives you immutable stuff.
[16:42:53] <CoderGuy> I see
[16:43:05] <bjs> CoderGuy: Python went the other way for e.g., and lets you overload almost everything

[16:46:29] <CoderGuy> yeah
[16:46:40] <Akronymus> Fair enough.

[17:47:34] <Quietwalker> I'm pleased that the Node.js folks never got ~that~ pretentious about it. You could always shut them down pretty quick by pointing out that they can call it whatever they want, but it's still javascript at the end of the day.
[17:48:10] <sandman13> 2-3 steps from npm and it's failures
[17:48:33] <mrig> Node was a backlash from those plebs that were relegated to the far lower echelons of design though.
[17:48:58] <mrig> it sort of snuck up on the programming world.
[17:49:17] <sandman13> node.js is fine but the moment npm enters into the context, I am out.
[17:49:55] <Quietwalker> For a while, I was convinced that too many web designers had made the leap to actual programmer without going through the growing period of experimentation and evolution that most programmers go through from the other direction

[17:58:32] <DnzAtWrk> then sure

[17:59:16] <DnzAtWrk> Not with those checksums preventing mutations :D
[17:59:22] <merijn> Case in point: Haskell's grammar specifies both brace-delimited and layout syntax. If curly braces are, indeed, superior you'd expect most code to use braces. Or at least maybe a significant faction using braces
[18:00:18] <merijn> In reality a solid 98% of all Haskell (and probably 100% of all code of the past decade, except when fitting in with the surrounding module) is written using layout
[18:00:52] <sandman13> Never knew Haskell supported brace-delimited syntax.
[18:01:12] <merijn> Because layout is just *obviously* superior for humans and all the people complaining about whitespace in python or just trying to gatekeep "real" programming, because python is a script-kiddie language or some nonsense like that
[18:01:17] <sandman13> Only time I used braces was with Record syntax
[18:01:24] <novns> those old Egyptian pyramids still run COBOL code

[18:02:27] <sandman13> merijn: That could be beneifical for one liners or in editors which screw up indentation

[18:02:56] <merijn> sandman13: Sure, but you can write the one line using >> directly instead of do-notation, though ;)
[18:03:12] <sandman13> merijn: too confusing for my knowledge level.

[18:04:28] <sandman13> "Write do notation" Sure "Use >> and >>= instead of do notation " heavy breathing xD
[18:05:23] <merijn> sandman13: tbh, do notation is fairly simple/straightforward syntactical sugar
[18:05:55] <merijn> sandman13: See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/do_notation and https://wiki.haskell.org/Do_notation_considered_harmful

[18:14:03] <sandman13> I think it is required to understand papers on various concepts like functors, monoids, applicatives and monads.

[18:14:31] <sandman13> Hmm.

[22:23:19] <pyzozord> Guest16: depends on your work, if you are just making websites then probably no, you don't need to deal with a b-tree. You just need to know a couple of technologies like your database, your language and your framework

[22:23:45] <archie> what's wrong with b-trees?

[22:52:12] <mrig> yes that is a trie.

[22:59:51] <pyzozord> mawk: actually I'm not that sure if it would be that bad. Honestly if they set a B-Tree index on that column then that just might be the most appropriate way to do this. There is no ther way to upload data than to insert it
[23:00:32] <dcand> at top-left side, suggesting Shift is the modifier key
[23:00:33] <pyzozord> mawk: alternatively they could upload it as a whole file and use some postgres scripting language to break it to words and insert it, but that seems like a lot of trouble and for really big files

[23:57:12] <jeaye> 👍
[23:57:31] <pyzozord> Looks like different programs handle it differently. I can type ctrl+shift+upizza in my terminal, but not in chrome, chrome appears to accept only hex values
[23:58:26] <pyzozord> I know that chrome doesn't use xinput2 so maybe that's the problem. I know that because I was trying to make chrome have kinetic scrolling with touchpad and there is just no clean way to do it
[23:59:20] <pyzozord> Very useful to know anyway. I was always doing cmd to open the ubuntu search feature and seach for the right character there
