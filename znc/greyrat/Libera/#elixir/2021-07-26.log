[12:16:32] <Nicd> so let's say you write a library A that depends on a dataset. that dataset can be downloaded with something like `mix a.download`. would you include the download code in the A library or make a separate ADataDownloader for the task? for the download code, what HTTP client would you use? or if it's `runtime: false` (if it's a separate package), then it doesn't matter?
[12:16:53] <Nicd> just thinking that I don't want to compile useless code and additional HTTP clients to the user's codebase

[12:48:58] <serafeim> hmmm not really sure. i haven't thought about it. can't you just include the dataset in the library ?
[12:51:27] <serafeim> for the http client i had used hackney in the past, no complains
[12:56:08] <vhf> Hey! I'm using a raw SQL query in Ecto for a very hairy query computing a bunch of stats, window functions etc, and I'd like to add a WHERE foo.id IN ($5)
[12:56:39] <vhf> so I'm passing a list of ints as $5 but ecto doesn't like that, it turns it in IN ([1,2,3])
[12:57:05] <vhf> and I cannot Enum.join because IN ("1,2,3") is not good obviously
[12:57:08] <vhf> any idea?

[13:24:52] *** Joins: natrys (~natrys@user/natrys)
[13:30:13] <Nicd> serafeim: then I would have to keep updating the library whenever the dataset updates
[13:30:58] <serafeim> Nicd: hm... you could just give instructions to the user to download the lib using wget or curl and then run a script to update it ?
[13:32:05] <serafeim> don't know what's better. i think that for instance tzdata checks for updates whenever you start your app: [debug] Tzdata polling for update.
[13:33:07] <Nicd> vhf: can't you do ANY($5)?
[13:33:24] <Nicd> serafeim: I could, but it wouldn't be as user friendly
[13:33:25] <serafeim> also it seems that the tzdata includes hackney also
[13:33:46] <serafeim> why not do what tzdata does ?
[13:34:04] <Nicd> I don't want to live update it, that's risky
[13:34:55] <serafeim> then add a mix task as you recommended. the tzdata checks if hackney is installed, if not it won't execute the update. so you can do the same in your mix task
[13:35:09] <serafeim> so you won't need to install the dependency
[13:35:15] <vhf> oh yes Nicd thanks a lot!
[13:36:04] <Nicd> serafeim: that doesn't really answer my questions
[13:38:55] <serafeim> here's your answers: include the download code in the library but also include an initial version of your dataset. use hackney in the mix task to update the dataset and check if the user has installed it before executing.
[13:40:19] <Nicd> this results in building the download code to the codebase (where it's not needed) and forcing the user to install Hackney if they wish to update the dataset... though I wonder if there's any nice way around the latter since the HTTP clients don't exactly have a uniform API to work against, like Poison/Jason do
[13:41:06] <Nicd> maybe we should have something like PSR-7 from PHP to standardise the APIs
[13:41:18] <serafeim> Nicd: since tzdata does this why not do the same ?
[13:41:26] <serafeim> i think you are over-thinking it
[13:41:45] <Nicd> I don't think tzdata is the gold standard
[13:42:06] <Nicd> at this point it's good to overthink when the library is still just a thing in my mind :P
[13:42:26] <serafeim> Nicd: also the proper solution would be for elixir to be *more* batteries included. for example python has a json and an http library. but that's not something you can fix
[13:43:22] <Nicd> well there is an HTTP library, but it's too painful :D
[13:44:04] <serafeim> there's an http library in elixir ?
[13:45:31] <Nicd> `:httpc`
[13:45:39] <serafeim> lol
[13:45:48] <serafeim> never heard of it i guess nobody uses it
[13:46:09] <Nicd> it's very raw so you need to handle things yourself
[13:46:21] <Nicd> like gunzip, setting proper tls settings to verify certificates, etc.
[13:46:48] <Nicd> but I think I could manage it. for this purpose tls verification isn't needed anyway
[13:47:12] <Nicd> my first Elixir project was an IRC bot that used httpc to analyze links pasted to channels so I've used it before

[20:14:45] <Riceberry> Quick question, i'm new to elixir and i'd like to know what setups (editors/plugins e.t.c) people use when working on projects
[20:15:12] <rawtaz> a lot of folks here use vs code with the obvious elixir extensions such as ElixirLS and so on
[20:15:22] <rawtaz> i guess theres some other usages as well
[20:15:51] <rawtaz> personally i use that and run all my elixir projects in docker containers, there are nice docker images for elixir and phoenix
[20:21:19] <Riceberry> What are the advantages of running projects in docker images?
[20:25:49] <rawtaz> several.
[20:25:52] <rawtaz> have you never used docker?
[20:34:44] <phaleth> Riceberry: vscode editor and ElixirLS extension
[20:35:16] <phaleth> make sure you get latest vscode otherwise ElixirLS will crash
[20:35:33] <hoppity> I personally do not recommend Docker due to it not clearly being FOSS. Also they have what seem to be proprietary Terms and Conditions
[20:36:00] <hoppity> And yes I know it is Apache licensed

[20:41:37] <hoppity> I am no expert but it seems to be a similar scenario as VSCode. 
[20:41:51] <hoppity> FOSS code with terms and conditions added on top.
[20:42:20] <hoppity> That's why I use VSCodium instead
[20:42:29] <rawtaz> hoppity: but what in practice is making it not FOSS? if you say this is the case, presumably you are basing it on some fact?

[20:44:51] <rawtaz> hoppity: let's rewind. you said that docker is not FOSS, i.e. that it is not 1) free to use, and 2) open source. what actual concrete thing are you basing this on?
[20:45:22] <rawtaz> if it's apache licensed, then that source code should indeed allow free of charge use as well as being open source. so i dont see what you are referring to, thats all
[20:45:48] <hoppity> Umm, let's not get too bogged down on the words. What I said is that it is not "clearly" FOSS and what I meant by that is the termsn and conditions.
[20:46:02] <rawtaz> of course there can be other products that are not licensed this way and that you have to pay for and what not, but thats not the basic docker
[20:46:20] <rawtaz> hoppity: yes, and i am asking you *what* in the terms and conditions are making you suggest that it is not free to use and/or open source?
[20:46:35] <hoppity> If I give you something and it is FOSS licensed then perfect, but if I add terms and conditions on top of that (which you can do with Apache) it starts to sound more like a EULA to me.
[20:46:37] <rawtaz> if you are saying that this is the case, presumably you have something particular in mind. if not, why are you saying it?
[20:47:02] <rawtaz> right. have they done that in the license for docker (added additional things)?
[20:47:10] <hoppity> My point is there should be no Terms..
[20:47:47] <rawtaz> thats a totally different thing. you said that docker is not free and open source. that is not at all the same thing as thinking it should have no terms at all
[20:47:56] <rawtaz> every single open source license thats commonly used has terms
[20:48:02] <hoppity> haha which is what I am explaining..
[20:48:39] <hoppity> https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-software-end-user-license-agreement
[20:49:11] <hoppity> If I have to serve you a legal document for "FOSS" it start to look shady at the very least
[20:51:52] <rawtaz> that horrible text pretty much says that there are two types of software distributed by the docker project - one which is licensed (non-FOSS) and one which is FOSS
[20:52:26] <rawtaz> pretty common - companies having an open source thing as the base and trying to get some revenue to be sustainable with something they built on top of that or on the side
[20:52:32] <rawtaz> but that doesnt mean the open source part isnt FOSS :)
[20:53:02] <rawtaz> (and seriously, we need these type of setups too in this world - not every type of company and product work in the "free product with paid services around it" setup, unfortunately)
[20:53:57] <rawtaz> to know which license and what rights/terms apply to a specific software or code or similar, one has to look at the licensing information that comes with it. it should be pretty clear i think, once you look into it
[20:55:01] <hoppity> I don't want to flood this channel with off topic comments so the last thing I can say is that I personally only use unrestricted projects and then support with donations, contributions etc. We can always discuss this subject in PM. 
[20:57:01] <rawtaz> hoppity: i dont think you have to be worried about the topicness, we're not disturbing anyone or stopping any on-topic conversations. but yeah, no point in beating a dead horse. what youre saying is that (as i understand it) if a project has anything else but completely FOSS parts, you dont want to support or use it. thats your choice of course.
[20:58:13] <rawtaz> for my part, i realize that we cant have only free software, it simply doesnt work that way in some cases, so as long as the *basis* is FOSS then i dont mind a company adding some additional stuff into a separate product that they have terms and one has to pay for. at least not as long as the basic one is still FOSS. why would it be a problem what they do on the side.
[21:00:18] <hoppity> Agree to disagree, I guess.
[21:03:59] <rawtaz> im not entirely sure what we disagree about, because we're practially talking about two different things IMO, but sure, whatever works for me :)
[21:04:07] <rawtaz> s/whatever/anything/
[21:05:54] <hoppity> not anything works for me :)
[21:11:15] <rawtaz> im pretty sure we'd have far less innovation taking off if there werent monies involved unfortunately :/
[21:11:29] <rawtaz> generally speaking, i mean
[21:12:45] <hoppity> I very much doubt that. No problem with the "monies" but for example, software patents literally *hurt* inovation. Threats of lawsuits do the same.
[21:13:28] <hoppity> But again, I find this a better subject for a different channel.
[21:14:00] <rawtaz> you keep mixing thing sup. now you introduced patents, which is different matter than anything we previously discussed..
[21:14:24] <rawtaz> honestly i think you are being misinformed, you are not considering multiple aspects of these things, you're just focused on open source in particular
[21:14:50] <hoppity> rawtaz:  so you are saying there are patents for any other reason than the "monies" ?
[21:15:00] <rawtaz> its hard to discuss this in any channel when you keep jumping between concerns or details, adding new ones all of a sudden, etc :-)
[21:15:36] <rawtaz> i am not talking about patents at all. patents is one thing, making money from stuff is another. you dont have to patent something just to make money off it. i mean, not everything is the US :-)
[21:16:06] <rawtaz> this was never a discussion about patents. if you want to discuss patents, thats another topic
[21:16:48] <hoppity> I was simply pointing out the flaw in your argument where you claim that monetary interest will bring us more inovation. Or we would have less inovation if there were no monetary interests.
[21:17:23] <hoppity> I elaborated on that, adding that patents (a way to ensure monetary gains) ws actually *hurting* inovation but that was too big of a jump for you I guess.
[21:17:46] <rawtaz> no. i said that without monetary interest and investments by various parties, some innovation would not *take off* as much as it does today. i did not say we would miss some of the innovation (although that's probably true as well). but both of these can probably be turned into it all just being delayed, i give you that.
[21:18:10] <hoppity> Exactly.
[21:18:40] <rawtaz> uh, no, not "exactly". you said that i said no monies means less innovation, and thats not what i was saying.
[21:18:53] <rawtaz> so your elaboration was not about what i said, it was about a variant of what i said.
[21:19:06] <rawtaz> im pretty much with you that patents are way too overused and can often be harmful
[21:19:20] <rawtaz> very often

[21:38:43] <hoppity> rawtaz: sorry had to take a phone call
[21:39:50] <hoppity> anyway, I think the dead horse is very much beat haha. I think money is not necessary for great software, it sounds like you think the opposite and I am fine with that.
[21:42:05] <rawtaz> hoppity: i dont disagree that money is not necessary for great software. i have no idea why you'd think i think so. i never suggested that great software cannot be created without money. seriously, please stop misreading what i say..
[21:42:28] <hoppity> wow
[21:42:53] <hoppity> Well this is really pointless. Good day.

[21:44:12] <rawtaz> i dont think im being unreasonable. i never suggested that great or even awesome or what not software cannot be created without any form of money at all. i completely agree that it can. but you suggested i said or thought that, which is simply not right. and if you re-read what we wrote, you might ask yourself why you even think i suggested that.
[21:44:22] <rawtaz> you are simply misreading what i wrote, or making wrong assumptions about it :/
[21:44:35] <rawtaz> im just trying to correct you so you dont sit here and say things that i never said :/

[21:48:15] <hoppity> I am just trying to have a quick conversation while working at my day job, I am not trying to convince you of anything. You admitted that software would eventually come any way thus contradicting what you said before, namely that some projects would not "take off" without investment.
[21:49:39] <hoppity> So forgive me fro giving you the benefit of assuming that you meant "great" software would need investment. Maybe you meant that shitty software would need investment? I don't know.

[22:06:47] <thojanssens> hi
[22:06:52] <hoppity> In any case, I personally do not accept, use or recommend software that comes with terms and conditions or software that is simply a bad version of the "real product" by design. I had an experince once with a peice of software for which one could not upgrade the database without moving to the "enterprise" version. So yes, technically FOSS but you are screwed the moment you run into any problem because all documentation basically says,
[22:06:52] <hoppity> "requires enterprise".
[22:07:03] <thojanssens> how do stale errors occur when calling Repo.insert/2 ?

[22:08:12] <rawtaz> thojanssens: can you clarify? are you getting an error message, and if so what is it?
[22:08:31] <rawtaz> hoppity: roger that. i wouldnt like that either. in that case someone clearly misbehaved :(
[22:08:38] <thojanssens> rawtaz, just loooking at the docs: https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Repo.html#c:insert/2
[22:08:49] <thojanssens> you can pass a `:stale_error_field` option
[22:09:04] <thojanssens> so I wondered, how do you get a stale entry error when calling `Repo.insert/2`
[22:11:42] <rawtaz> aha
[22:11:56] <thojanssens> rawtaz, you figured it out?
[22:12:38] <rawtaz> not at all, i just understood what you meant :)
[22:14:59] <thojanssens> i get it with update and delete
[22:15:09] <thojanssens> where you try updating/deleting a record that does not exist
[22:15:10] <thojanssens> but insert?
[22:15:18] <thojanssens> I don't see
[22:54:01] <thojanssens> rawtaz, ok 20mins later just found by more carefully reading docs, stale entries are cause by upserts with insert/2
