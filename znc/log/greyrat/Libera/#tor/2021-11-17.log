[17:11:12] <Guest39> why many suggest to use tor on tails
[17:11:32] <Guest39> xx :)
[17:12:49] <xx> Guest39: because it prevents some common failure cases for users that don't know much about computers
[17:13:02] <Guest39> such as?
[17:13:09] <xx> such as swapping some things into a swapfile, or saving unencrypted copies of data to unencrypted disks
[17:13:19] <xx> or forgetting to use torbrowser
[17:13:19] <xx> etc.
[17:13:21] <Guest39> swapping things?
[17:13:26] <xx> swapfile
[17:13:30] <Guest39> what about ut
[17:13:45] <Guest39> usually people would open tor browser with safest settings and use it
[17:14:00] <xx> in many cases, that's not enough
[17:14:14] <Guest39> why
[17:14:20] <xx> plus then you have the whole other issue of the rest of the system not being secure, such as windows systems without applied windows updates
[17:14:44] <xx> hence getting a verified and updated live OS such as tails is a good thing
[17:14:49] <Guest39> use linux and auto apply security update
[17:15:07] <Guest39> tails also would have to be updated
[17:15:37] <xx> a lot of users end up using random weird linux distros with shoddy update practices, or things that call home all the time
[17:15:45] <Guest39> home?
[17:15:50] <xx> all of that can help with traffic correlation for the adversary
[17:15:59] <Guest39> how
[17:16:04] <xx> yeah, like automatically connecting to google to check if network connectivity exists
[17:16:04] <Guest39> is there a real study?
[17:16:14] <Guest39> emmm
[17:16:25] <Guest39> which app would do that?
[17:16:34] <Guest39> simply install apps from a distro rep
[17:16:39] <xx> on ubuntu, probably their version of networkmanager
[17:16:51] <Guest39> highly unlikely
[17:17:20] <xx> guaranteed it does that, that's how they check for captive portals
[17:17:35] <xx> maybe it's a default gnome thing too
[17:17:52] <Guest39> eeee
[17:17:54] <xx> overall, tails is a good thing for most users
[17:18:01] <Guest39> hello they dont do that
[17:18:12] <Guest39> tails - limited storage
[17:18:16] <Guest39> needs to be updated also
[17:18:31] <xx> look, don't use tails if you don't want to
[17:18:36] <Guest39> why would anything to ping google to check for a captive portals?
[17:18:40] <xx> just understand that non-live OS have inherent issues
[17:19:12] <Guest39> well the only issue that you highlighted it is very unlikely
[17:19:26] <Guest39> captive portals are detected by browsers
[17:19:38] <Guest39> not a network managers pinging google
[17:19:50] <xx> https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/07/ubuntu-17-10-work-captive-portal-wifi
[17:20:19] <xx> "For Ubuntu 17.10, the Desktop Team hope to enable the ‘connectivity check’ feature available in Network Manager, the default networking stack on Ubuntu, to detect captive portals."
[17:20:40] <xx> "GNOME added support for captive portals in GNOME 3.14,"
[17:20:47] <xx> it's not just browsers
[17:21:00] <xx> even windows checks for many things in the background, without any browsers being open
[17:21:06] <Guest39> Ubuntu wants to add an on/off switch for connectivity check in GNOME Control Center
[17:21:12] <Guest39> on off switch
[17:21:17] <Guest39> not hidden checks
[17:22:33] <Guest39> windows os?
[17:22:33] <xx> on by default though
[17:22:47] <Guest39> dont think so
[17:23:10] <xx> spin up a vm of latest ubuntu and check
[17:23:22] <xx> ideally capture the traffic too to detect where else it connects to
[17:23:32] <Guest39> use firewall :)
[17:24:01] <xx> outgoing firewalls on linux are not really a thing, and those that exist can trivially be bypassed
[17:24:09] <Guest39> lolol
[17:24:12] <Guest39> ufw
[17:24:19] <Guest39> no bypassing
[17:25:56] <Guest39> how would ufw be bypassed?
[17:26:11] <xx> ufw doesn't have granular outgoing control, e.g. you can't use it to prevent the calculator app from connecting to 80/tcp to get currency updates
[17:27:08] <Guest39> it does have
[17:27:26] <Guest39> also why would such malware be included in ubuntu distro?
[17:27:36] <xx> are you being contrarian on purpose?
[17:27:42] <Guest39> or how it helps to correlate trafic
[17:27:52] <xx> go check out these things for yourself, a brief online search will show you all of this
[17:28:05] <xx> I'm just here to let people know about things that they often don't know about
[17:28:30] <xx> I strongly suggest reading the torproject blog, as well as the published studies
[17:35:35] <Guest39> each proposed ubuntu weakness have to be listed instead of blanket aquisations
[17:36:33] <Guest39> i did ask in #ubuntu and they are saying they are no longer spying on people
[17:37:15] <Guest39> is there an article that shows how exactly ubuntu does spy and how it can be used to correlate traffic?
[17:37:46] <Guest39> else it creates impression that matter is not understood and it's akin to paranoia
[17:54:58] <Th|ef> great convo right there :)
[18:01:36] <xx> again, I didn't say spying. Ubuntu used to be "spying" when it was sending some gnome shell commands to an online search service by default, but that was removed.
[18:02:46] <xx> but there are lots of places where ubuntu initiates connections to the internet without the user knowing about it or being informed, such as when you open the settings menu where accounts are listed, it initiates connections to google, microsoft, facebook, dropbox etc. to check stuff
[18:03:18] <nikow> Guest39: How can i setup my ufw to pass/block certain apps? 
[18:03:20] <Th|ef> in all fairness there are gnome extensions that are optional accross other distros that are capable of the exact same thing, and are made specifically for that to help enhance the gnome desktop via plugins etc
[18:03:35] <xx> and ubuntu is not the only distro that does it, it's pretty common and not really problematic in general. However for a user in a repressive regime that wants to use tor it might be a problem.
[18:04:16] <xx> tails takes greater care to remove this functionality by default, hence you see recommendations for using tails - which is the answer to your original question
[18:04:19] <nikow> Example of ubuntu connecting to random hosts is unattended update.

[22:16:14] <nikow> xx: Yeah, that's why i asked this guy to prove nonsense which he stated. 
[22:16:41] <nikow> xx: It's only reason why IMHO windows firewalls are better. :D
[22:17:11] <nikow> for consumers
[22:17:25] <xx> even windows firewalls have trouble accurately finding out which application is making a request
[22:17:43] <xx> if one knows what to do, you can use some system service to make the connection on your behalf
[22:17:53] <xx> and if that system service is allowed in the firewall, then the connection will go through
[22:18:12] <xx> one of the simpler ones to use is background intelligent services
[22:18:21] <xx> most users have that one enabled
[22:20:54] <nikow> I need to read about it, i am still in 'easy legacy iptables' world. 
[22:22:10] <xx> on linux, the only way of being almost there wrt disabling connection to the internet is to run apps in a bubblewrap container (flatpak) or firejail, both utilizing linux kernel network namespaces
[22:22:28] <xx> or just start every app in its own virtual machine
[22:23:47] <xx> a regular user on any platform (win/linux/mac/android/ios/...) has no chance of preventing information leaks
[22:24:08] <xx> it really needs a lot of knowledge, which is good news for all the TLAs
[22:26:05] <Guest39> tla?
[22:26:19] <xx> Three-Letter-Agency
[22:28:23] <Guest39> firewalls are easy
[22:28:26] <Guest39> hmm
[22:28:54] <Guest39> are you saying ubuntu distro has some malware that use using tcp 80 to dial home?
[22:29:04] <xx> not malware, it's a feature
[22:30:45] <nikow> xx: Hmm… I have it solved easy - there is whonix gateway in front of me. ^^ 
[22:31:01] <nikow> If anything wants to go to internet as myself - i need to allow it.  
[22:31:55] <xx> yeah, but you lose a lot of granularity that way, in the simplest setup

[22:40:00] <Guest39> so ok lets say some services connect to their server
[22:40:08] <Guest39> surely simplest solution is to remove then
[22:40:17] <Guest39> I do not think ubuntu considers its a feature
[22:40:39] <xx> ubuntu considers a feature that the calculator gets currency conversion ratios updates
[22:40:53] <xx> similarly with captive portal detection
[22:40:56] <xx> snapd autoupdates
[22:41:02] <xx> system autoupdates
[22:41:09] <xx> popularity telemetry
[22:41:11] <xx> etc.
[22:41:17] <xx> all useful features for ubuntu
[22:41:20] <Guest39> I asked in ubuntu they are saying its a fud
[22:41:22] <Guest39> I will ask more
[22:41:36] <xx> it is fud if anyone calls it spying or malware
[22:41:45] <xx> it is not fud if you call it a useful feature, which it is
[22:41:54] <Guest39> well ok if its useful
[22:42:01] <Guest39> how it can be used to track people
[22:42:13] <xx> however none of those are things you'd want in a privacy-preserving os, such as tails
[22:42:33] <xx> which is why tails comes without all of that functionality
[22:42:33] <Guest39> that is not specific enough of an accusation
[22:42:47] <Guest39> how those so called useful features can be used to track people
[22:43:15] <xx> look, if you challenge the point that something in the system making periodic/automatic connections in the background without the user being prompted is a bad thing, then there's little more to say about this
[22:43:53] <xx> I haven't personally reviewed the sourcecode of the calculator app, so I can't say if it has a possible RCE vuln when the currency gets updated

[22:44:29] <Guest39> bad is not specific - where is some possible attacks scenarious??
[22:44:35] <Guest39> scenario
[22:44:44] <Guest39> we cant just say bad good
[22:44:48] <xx> similarly I haven't reviewed other parts of ubuntu to see if they use persistent system identifiers when making connections, likely to prevent overloading the remote systems
[22:45:05] <xx> I literally just described the scenario to you
[22:46:59] <xx> since this is #tor and not a general privacy channel, then I'll just say that just because one uses tor/torbrowser doesn't mean that one is anonymous, and we often see user failures in protecting their own safety due to mistaken ideas about what tor does
[22:48:42] <xx> I've long advocated for having a user prompt asking "Is there a chance of your life being in danger as a result of using tor?" where if the user says "Yes", then they'd be shown extensive documentation first.
[22:48:57] <Guest39> nice idea
[22:49:39] <xx> naturally I also don't give a rats ass about users using tor for piracy/spam and other illegal activity that is just a nuisance for everyone
[22:49:50] <xx> let those rot in prison for all I care
