[00:00:33] <benwilson512> yeah some of it isn't relevant, but the bit about starting up a bunch repos should be applicable
[00:00:59] <benwilson512> no reason you couldn't start a few hundred of those with a low connection pool
[00:01:14] <benwilson512> my main question is: for a given "request" (or equivalent) how do you know what DB to hit?
[00:03:13] <cess11> that's a good question, i've been thinking about that too but haven't gotten very far
[00:04:07] <benwilson512> well setting aside the code bits
[00:04:13] <benwilson512> what distinguishes one db from another?
[00:04:18] <benwilson512> is it broken up by user?
[00:04:51] <cess11> only the database name, and in the ui some metadata stored in each
[00:05:30] <benwilson512> why is it many databases at all?
[00:06:54] <cess11> they each serve an application instance of another system, so it would be something like a backoffice application for administering another application
[00:07:22] <creature> Sometimes it's nice to give each customer a completely isolated data store, too. 
[00:07:46] <benwilson512> gotcha.
[00:08:03] <benwilson512> in that case you could lazily spin up repos
[00:08:23] <benwilson512> based on when a backoffice user actually needs to try to access a specific end customer's data
[00:09:19] <cess11> yeah, i would have isolated but the people that built it lacked the experience and resources way back when and i'm fairly new in the organisation

[00:11:23] <cess11> do you have an example of roughly how that could be done? something like my idea above, starting up another application on the beam on e.g. login or similar user interaction?

[16:10:52] <hauleth> josevalim: is it guaranteed that function used by macro will have 'MACRO-' prefix?
[16:11:18] <hauleth> Or is there any other way to extract that information form compiler?
[16:37:09] <josevalim> hauleth: it is internal information, unlikely to change, but not guaranteed to to not change
[16:37:35] <hauleth> Sad. As it would help with mix_unused
[16:37:49] <hauleth> BTW I have released first version
[16:38:03] <hauleth> As it now works with Elixir 1.10+

[17:22:00] <josevalim> hauleth: on elixir master there is a on_module information on the tracer which you can use to collect module metadata
[17:22:09] <josevalim> i think you can use the Module API to see what is a function and what is a macro etc
