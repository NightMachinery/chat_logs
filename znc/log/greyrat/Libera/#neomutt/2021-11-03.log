[14:13:14] <flatcap> morning all

[14:31:33] <gahr> :)
[14:31:37] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[14:34:21] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[14:34:35] <flatcap> I renamed the docker image the other day...
[14:34:47] <flatcap> if you rebase your PR branch over master, it'll start building properly
[14:39:51] <gahr> done
[14:41:02] <flatcap> nice work, btw.  it's surprising how much of a difference on syscall can make
[14:41:52] <gahr> can you repro the diff at your end?
[14:42:13] <gahr> I don't want to start making the code uglier to save a few milliseconds
[14:42:38] <flatcap> will do in a sec

[14:56:33] <bookworm> amazing
[14:58:31] <gahr> ok so no difference :)
[14:59:39] <flatcap> over 50 runs, there's even less difference for me
[15:02:13] <gahr> what if you -e 'set read_inc=1000' ?
[15:02:40] <flatcap> =0 disables, doesn't it?
[15:02:44] * flatcap tries
[15:02:56] <gahr> it should save more calles
[15:02:57] <gahr> calles
[15:02:59] <gahr> calls!
[15:03:30] <gahr> I get 1s vs 1.5s roughly
[15:04:14] *** Quits: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[15:04:30] <flatcap> running...
[15:06:50] <flatcap> I tried the read_inc=0 yesterday and didn't see any change in the strace output
[15:08:24] <flatcap> I was expecting the gettimeofday() or some variant to show up
[15:09:25] <gahr> I'm betting 30% average gain over 10 runs
[15:09:47] <gahr> I'm on a VPS, not a big bare-metal machine
[15:09:57] <gahr> and this is not extremely fast or powerful
[15:10:01] <flatcap> likewise, a VPS
[15:10:29] <flatcap> SSD, though
[15:10:42] <gahr> me too
[15:11:19] <gahr> read_inc=0 should kill any difference right?
[15:11:38] <flatcap> I think so
[15:11:51] <gahr> yeah it does here
[15:12:04] <gahr> still running your read_inc=1000 test?
[15:12:15] <flatcap> 50 runs, read_inc=0.  master: 2.260s, PR: 2.272s
[15:13:08] <gahr> ok that makes sense, I'm skipping the gettimeofday completely on progress->inc == 0
[15:13:18] <flatcap> yep
[15:13:37] <flatcap> running =1000, now
[15:16:08] <gahr> 30% gain with read_inc=0
[15:17:17] <gahr> it takes 3x times with read_inc=1
[15:18:17] <gahr> and the difference goes away
[15:18:54] <flatcap> 50 runs, read_inc=1000.  master: 2.311s, PR: 2.267s
[15:21:12] <gahr> your gettimeofday is fast :)
[15:21:30] <flatcap> must be :-)
[15:22:54] <gahr> read_inc=0.  master: 2.260s, PR: 2.272s
[15:22:57] <gahr> read_inc=1000.  master: 2.311s, PR: 2.267s
[15:22:59] <gahr> mh...
[15:23:31] <gahr> it *still* makes more difference where it should
[15:23:37] <gahr> just it's a smaller difference
[15:23:41] <flatcap> yeah
[15:23:49] <gahr> master: 2.260s, PR: 2.272s
[15:23:51] <gahr> but this is weird
[15:23:56] <gahr> how can the PR be slower?
[15:24:27] <gahr> I guess it's the relative time spent in gettimeofday vs. the rest of loading it up
[15:24:34] <flatcap> random fluctuations in the space-time continuum?
[15:25:07] <gahr> I don't think it's a continuum :)
[15:25:09] <gahr> but yeah
[15:25:32] <gahr> so up to you, the PR does make a difference to me and the code is not unlookable-at
[15:25:45] <gahr> but it's not like it's a game changer..
[15:26:04] <flatcap> yeah, the PR makes sense
[15:27:16] <flatcap> when you strace, do you see gettimeofday() (or similar)? because I don't
[15:27:36] <flatcap> the only differences I see are the number of write()s (the progress text)
[15:28:05] <flatcap> (master and PR included)
[15:29:33] <gahr> I don't have a linux to run strace on
[15:29:46] <gahr> but yeah, I do see the calls to gettimeofday
[15:30:05] <gahr> lunch bbl
[15:30:06] <flatcap> hmm...  I wonder where mine are going

[16:35:55] <gahr> back
[16:36:24] <flatcap> I've been googling and reading...
[16:36:37] <flatcap> now I know why gettimeofday() doesn't show up
[16:36:54] <gahr> I think I know, too
[16:36:58] <flatcap> there's a magic shared library in linux, linux-vdso.so.1
[16:37:21] <flatcap> it maps to a special bit of kernel that avoids having to do slow syscalls
[16:37:51] <gahr> ah, didn't know about that
[16:38:03] <gahr> but I also reached the conclusion that gettimeofday was being executed on user space
[16:38:17] <flatcap> I've seen the vdso thing before, but never know why or what it was :-)
[16:39:32] <flatcap> I've also learnt about ltrace (which is SLOOOOOOW), which can capture ALL library calls
[16:41:03] <flatcap> running neomutt, strace: 33K lines, ltrace: 2.9M lines

[16:48:23] <Kinnison> ltrace is super-useful at times.
[16:48:33] <Kinnison> though running it without any filter is a tad risky IMO
[16:51:19] <flatcap> yeah, I can see why.  every dup'd string is logged
[16:53:50] <Kinnison> My absolute favourite debugging tool is `rr` though that requires that you stand a chance of reproducing the issue locally
[16:56:17] <flatcap> oh, i remember that.  but it was 32-bit only at the time I read about it
[16:57:07] * Kinnison nods.  It has been 64bit for a while now.  It's pretty much my go-to tool when debugging anything written in C
[16:57:58] <flatcap> oh good. I'll have to make some time to play around with it
[17:02:32] <gahr> I guess I should learn dtrace
[17:03:14] <gahr> I also guess strace is similar to our ktrace? https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?ktrace

[19:37:11] <adray> how's it going, flatcap?
[19:37:28] <bremner> adray: not sure if you saw, the fixes for open_with_config we talked about are in 0.34.1, just released
[19:37:58] <adray> thanks, bremner!
[19:39:53] <flatcap> good thanks.  TIL: a bunch of deep stuff about syscalls :-)
[19:40:26] <flatcap> oh, and reacquainted myself with 'rr' -- a debugger that can go backwards!
[19:41:18] <flatcap> how are you?  up to anything exciting?

[19:47:37] <adray> things are well. just spending the day doing interview prep and shifting towards a normal workday schedule. some absolutely thrilling stuff
[19:47:50] <flatcap> :-)
[19:51:08] <adray> `rr` is a neat tool though i've only used it for rust projects
[19:59:33] * Kinnison hasn't even considered using `rr` for Rust stuff.  I should play around.  I suppose I'm a bit dubious about the likelihood of a gdb style debugger working well with things like generic types.
[20:05:56] <adray> Kinnison: there's a cargo extension, `cargo-rr`, that makes recording and replay easier. gdb worked well enough for my needs when i was playing around with it.
[20:12:08] <Kinnison> neat
