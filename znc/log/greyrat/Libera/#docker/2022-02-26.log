[02:01:03] <bn_work> Is there any way to inspect the syslog of a container that exited with `-137`?  Every post I've seen on this claims this is a memory issue but my Docker Desktop v4.5.0 is already allocating 8 cores, 16GB, 4GB swap on this M1 MBP with 10 cores + 32GB RAM.  Also, `"OOMKilled": false` & `"Error": ""`.  Issue is basically similar to this:  
[02:01:03] <bn_work> https://forums.docker.com/t/container-fails-with-error-137-but-no-oom-flag-set-and-theres-plenty-of-ram/69336  What gives?
[02:03:50] <bn_work> the ridiculous thing is on my older mid-2015 with DD v3.3.3 (allocating 3 cores, 12GB, 4GB swap), launched with `docker-compose up` (ie: v1 Compose), no weird -137 issue launching 5 containers
[02:05:03] <bn_work> PS: on DD v4.5.0, on the newer more powerful Mac, I tried with both `docker-compose up` and `docker compose up`, ie:  v1 & v2, result is the same

[02:06:18] <bn_work> FYI, inspecting the logs of the container exiting with -127 (cassandra BTW) shows *NO* error, it just basically disappears

[02:13:20] <DoofusCanadensis> that forum entry points to github issue... lots of version disection in the components that are actually running
[02:13:38] <DoofusCanadensis> I'm not sure how you'd debug the Linux VM running inside DD
[02:20:51] <bn_work> DoofusCanadensis: if I could inspect the syslog of the dead container perhaps that'd help?  is that possible?
[02:20:56] <bn_work> after the fact?
[02:22:46] <DoofusCanadensis> as long as the container wasn't removed, logs should still be available
[02:29:48] <bn_work> DoofusCanadensis: how do I view them?  `docker logs compose-cassandra-1` only shows me Cassandra's service log (ie:  `/var/log/cassandra/system.log` I think) vs the container OS's syslog

[02:44:28] <bn_work> oh, n/m, the container is still around
[02:47:53] <tianon> bn_work: "the container OS's syslog" isn't a thing unless your container happens to be running syslog (or something that similarly listens on "/dev/log" like syslog would, and something inside the container is using it)
[02:47:55] <bn_work> and of course silly me, *CONTAINERS DON'T HAVE SYSLOG BY DEFAULT* because by design the damn things have to be stripped down, rofl
[02:48:00] <tianon> :D
[02:48:25] <bn_work> tianon: yeah, just realized that now :(
[02:48:51] <tianon> if you configure your containers/daemon to use a logging driver like journald, then the logs can persist after the container is removed
[02:49:26] <tianon> see https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/ and/or https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/journald/ for more about that :)
[02:49:40] <bn_work> the container seems to still be around, I haven't deleted it yet
[02:50:05] *** Joins: Null_A (~null_a@2601:645:8700:2290:d551:3b83:119f:82c5)
[02:50:23] <bn_work> tianon: I'm poking around in it now trying to see what caused this -137 but AFAICT, it was humming along and Docker just pulled the rug out from under it :(
[02:50:33] <tianon> oh cassandra, hmm - doesn't it default to trying to use some outrageous percentage of all memory unless you tell it not to?
[02:51:08] <tianon> yeah, you probably want to set some combination of MAX_HEAP_SIZE / HEAP_NEWSIZE
[02:51:26] <tianon> otherwise it won't care what memory is already in use and will try to gobble up all of everything
[02:51:59] <bn_work> tianon:  does it?  the exact same compose file runs fine on a mid-2015 MBP + DD v3.3.3 (allocating only 3 cores + 12 GB + 4GB swap)
[02:52:12] <bn_work> and that's 5 containers
[02:52:48] <bn_work> and I'm talking just startup, not after running for a few days or anything
[02:52:56] <ses1984> i have two machines running the same `docker-compose up` -- the same container died on each machine, one restarted, one didn't, they both have restart policy always
[02:52:57] <bn_work> like after 5 mins of start bootstrap
[02:53:08] <tianon> it's definitely very aggressive on startup
[02:53:27] <ses1984> i'm trying to figure out what could have gone wrong. docker system events says the container died with exit code 254 and i'm not sure where in my app i return that
[02:54:26] <tianon> ses1984: anything useful in the container logs?
[02:55:14] <tianon> bn_work: I just ran a bare cassandra container (no extra options/flags) and checked docker stats and it's immediately using 8+GiB of memory
[02:55:30] <tianon> (on a machine with 64GiB total)
[02:57:05] <tianon> I can't find where the defaults are set/calculated, but https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/7ea0a4aa410e9d0d252115607ac5c31d37784357/conf/cassandra-env.sh#L126-L139 is useful
[02:57:22] <ses1984> the container logs show an application error, at the time the container died, then new logs from when the container was manually restarted
[02:57:33] <ses1984> the funny thing is, why did the container restart on one box but not the other
[02:58:31] <tianon> ses1984: anything interesting in the "State" section of "docker container inspect" ?
[02:58:54] <ses1984> that part is gone, not captured by the customer
[02:59:06] <tianon> you can also verify that the container actually *did* get the restart policy you requested in the HostConfig section of that same output
[02:59:30] <tianon> without the ability to inspect more, we're just speculating :)
[02:59:34] <ses1984> there's no way i can know that for sure, but restart: always is specified in our compose ymls, that is what is there now
[02:59:54] <ses1984> we did observe that the docker compose config-hash changed, i wonder if that would prevent autorestart
[03:00:54] <tianon> is it possible the customer changed something? ðŸ˜…
[03:01:46] <ses1984> we can't rule it out but it's unlikely
[03:01:53] <bn_work> tianon:  ok, so it uses 8GB, I've allocated 16GB + 4GB swap.  It still doesn't explain the random -137 exit code with no explanation whatsoever (ie:  `error: ""`) in `docker inspect compose-cassandra-1`?
[03:02:13] <tianon> yeah, not sure what else to suggest there
[03:02:15] <bn_work> tianon: how are you checking mem usage stats?
[03:02:25] <tianon> "docker stats <container>"
[03:02:34] <ses1984> what determines com.docker.compose.config-hash
[03:04:17] <ses1984> my theory is that the container was started, something changed config-hash, the container died, different config-hash blocked auto-restart
[03:04:29] *** Quits: codebam (~codebam@user/codebam) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[03:05:24] <tianon> hmm, it's possible, but not likely -- Docker itself doesn't know about (nor care about) that compose hash annotation/label
[03:05:46] <tianon> think of compose like a very smart shell script wrapper around docker commands
[03:06:04] <tianon> after "compose up" finishes, compose is done and no longer involved in that container's lifecycle until you run a compose command again
[03:06:15] <bn_work> tianon: I just restarted the -137 killed cassandra:3.11 container and it was using 4GiB
[03:06:32] <bn_work> when I measured via `docker stats compose-cassandra-1`

[17:40:03] <tabakhase> spinningcat kinda hard to recommend videos (not only cause i dont know a specific one ;D) but also cause packing "docker" in video form seems rather complex... and generally just a deep-read of the getting started page gets you "todo something" - from there follow some examples of stuff you actually want todo (i usually recommend CI-tooling as first-projects) and then its rly just a grow-as-you-go 
[17:40:04] <tabakhase> kinda deal where docker in itself isnt actually complicated, and only has like 4 commands and a dozen or so arguments that will do 99% of the work...
[17:41:02] <tabakhase> that said, for the "lifecycle" part video/image may certainly be more digestable than text :P
[17:42:18] <spinningcat> 4 commands and many arguments hmm
[17:45:43] <tabakhase> i wouldnt even call it "many" - as a lot is "literally the name of the thing you want" :D - you just need to be "aware that it exists" and when/where its used in the first place ((what i know sounds kinda stupid yes :D))
[17:46:51] <tabakhase> like, im not talkign remembering what "-aOmnN 4" does, but "knowing --env to ship in an env-var"  :D
[17:47:49] <spinningcat> so configuration file is important part here?

[17:48:55] <tabakhase> and as long as you got some linux basics, rly the only thing to "understand" is a bit of the underlaying namespaces/cgroup/jail-call it what you will idea + understanding "images vs containers"
[17:49:39] <spinningcat> well i know some linux already
[17:50:00] <spinningcat> and i understand like image is like what you prepare inside containers
[17:50:12] <spinningcat> container is simply linux os
[17:50:31] <spinningcat> and you run image inside linux am i correct?
[17:53:20] <tabakhase> close ;-)  - images are the things you build / load from the hub -- containers are "running images" you could say (what isnt technically correct as you "create" an explicit cntainer (thats based on the images filesystem)
[17:54:05] <tabakhase> so they are the same, but absolutely not - and also one makes the other, while the other also creates the other :D - and thats where it gets a little messy on the first round lol :P
[17:55:03] <tabakhase> where in the end, all rly to know is that you build images with dockerfiles, and run containers with cmd/&entrypoints - and anything further topples from that

[18:01:55] <tabakhase> pretty much -- that may seem a tad ??? in the start, but youll see that this very much matters as "images" are shared (not just between multiple people, but possibly even between mutliple same containers on your one single PC) - so you may want to bake "microservice:version1.1.23.5.2" as an image, but not pack the password for your production DB into that :D
[18:03:27] <spinningcat> will it cause sql injection?
[18:06:32] <tabakhase> not direct injection, but you wouldnt wanne leak this - also you hopefully need a different password on your dev system ;-)

[18:07:54] <tabakhase> the "official mysql images" and get almost 400lines of bashscripting in your face :D https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/blob/master/5.7/docker-entrypoint.sh cause "they need to move that whole database-setup" that normally happens "when building the image with apt-get install" to "when the image actually starts"

[21:42:47] <veracioux> Hi, I made a small bash utility that allows you to dynamically generate dockerfiles based on environment variables, and adds support for any shell syntax: you can add if statements, define helper functions, even source other files inside a Dockerfile. It's nothing special really, but I hope someone finds it useful: https://github.com/veracioux/shdocker
