[00:31:59] <aaii> Hmm that's cool :| but lazy to join in 2 servers and create acc for them :(

[00:33:32] <jhutchins> aaii: The Debian support channels started out on freenode, then "officially" migrated to OFTC at some point.  Most of the freenoe channels persisted, but a lot of the specialized channels, develpment, packaging, etc. are only on OFTC.
[00:33:57] <bozra> i don't say i will read it he should read it
[00:34:10] <greycat> Mostly, what happened was the Debian developers moved to OFTC and the Debian users stayed on Freenode.
[00:34:19] <jhutchins> aaii: The freenode channels migrated to libera earlier this year, and most of the channels and membershp on freenode were destroyed or are just rubble left behind.
[00:34:41] <aaii> greycat, yeeaah , But MY shi**y laptop needs some new drivers :O and they didn't release for stable version :(
[00:34:41] <greycat> So #debian and the non-English variants of #debian stayed on Freenode (now, they've moved to Libera), whereas every *other* Debian channel is on OFTC.

[03:39:11] <ede> but since it also ignores exact filestamps (i should run some more tests but so far it seems so) i use `cp` in the command line to keep them exact. multiple files with the then exact same timestamp don't sort really well chronologically.
[03:40:23] <ede> so it would just be an extra option i'd have to use. i'd prefer the file solution, but since it's not available... or i could script it maybe since i use `cp` anyway, hm.

[06:42:22] <Powerhouse6666> sney, first time Debian user here. I am on a vm using virtmanager trying to get http connection.  Wired connection has static ip information so now I need to change the network script file I call them on Centos
[06:43:28] <greycat> Networks are configured in /etc/network/interfaces by default, *or* with Network Manager, *or* with systemd-networkd.

[11:55:00] <no_gravity> "debconf: unable to initialize frontend: Dialog"
[11:55:12] <no_gravity> Whats going on?
[11:55:57] <no_gravity> (This happens when update/upgrade is run in a fresh Debian 11 install as the first command)
[11:58:23] <PMT> if you're running it via some remote command execution interface that's not interactive, you probably want DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt update [...]
[11:59:20] <PMT> cf. https://askubuntu.com/a/693180
[11:59:25] <no_gravity> PMT: Interesting. I never had to do this before I think.

[11:59:52] *** Joins: HasanAtizaz (~hasan@user/hasanatizaz)
[11:59:59] <mrjpaxton[m]> Sounds like Dialog or Whiptail package is missing. Someone has a solution to try: `sudo apt-get install dialog apt-utils`
[12:00:06] <mrjpaxton[m]> Not sure what else could help.
[12:00:35] <mrjpaxton[m]> Though wouldn't it launch the text dialogs, instead?
[12:00:56] <PMT> I don't know how they're running it, so I can't guess.
[12:01:16] *** Quits: Tokamak (~Tokamak@172.58.191.72) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:01:17] <mrjpaxton[m]> True.
[12:01:20] <no_gravity> mrjpaxton[m]: But why do I need it? This is not in a specific configuration. It is the first command I run in a fresh debian container just started with "docker run -it debian:11-slim".
[12:01:52] <no_gravity> This has never happened before. It started today.
[12:02:31] <mrjpaxton[m]> Some packages, when you install them, will come up with options when you install them. So the dialog helps you set these defautl settings. But non-interactive mode should just not prompt you for anything, and set package defaults.
[12:02:48] <PMT> well, then you should examine what changed in that container definition between the last time you tried it and this didn't happen and now.
[12:02:55] <mrjpaxton[m]> That's as far as I know, at least.
[12:03:23] <no_gravity> PMT: There is no container definition. The run command creates a new container from the debian base image. With no modification whatsoever.
[12:03:40] <no_gravity> docker run --rm -it debian:11-slim
[12:04:00] <mrjpaxton[m]> I can't help on the Docker side though, sorry.
[12:04:12] <PMT> "There's no definition, it just uses the unmodified definition", you say

[12:06:43] <mrjpaxton[m]> It's not like I haven't used Docker before, I just have very little experience with it... If you're running containers in an interactive terminal, and installing packages, by default some packages may prompt you for setting options, *unless* you use "DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive", like someone suggested.
[12:07:14] <no_gravity> mrjpaxton[m]: Even when I leave out the "-y" it throws the errors.
[12:07:17] <mrjpaxton[m]> Though after reading this - https://bobcares.com/blog/debian_frontendnoninteractive-docker/ - It looks like you want to set "ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive" in a Dockerfile configuration.
[12:07:44] <no_gravity> mrjpaxton[m]: Guess I'll have to bite that bitter apple.
[12:08:10] <mrjpaxton[m]> Though the article says not to use it all the time.
[12:08:11] <mrjpaxton[m]> I guess that's understandable.
[12:08:20] <no_gravity> Uh oh
[12:09:46] <no_gravity> I have the feeling it is not related to Docker. But to which debian packages are installed.

[12:16:19] <themill> you get to keep the pieces etc
[12:16:49] <jelly> you're not supposed to run interactive stuff inside docker; if you install packages, preseed the answers
[12:17:46] <mrjpaxton[m]> Gee, it's like Debian should have a declarative package manager.
[12:17:52] <mrjpaxton[m]> Or something.
[12:17:55] <no_gravity> themill: The same happens with the non-slim variant today.
[12:18:12] <mrjpaxton[m]> Introducing, Nix Debian.
[12:18:28] <no_gravity> jelly: I'm not sure I would call "apt update -y && apt upgrade -y" "interactive stuff".
[12:18:37] <jelly> maybe people could use docker for single processes, not install extra stuff inside
[12:18:39] <mrjpaxton[m]> It kinda is.
[12:18:58] <themill> mrjpaxton[m]: this has nothing to do with package management software and lots to do with soft-dependencies and what happens when you violate them
[12:19:13] <no_gravity> jelly: Still would need to update/upgrade even if you only run a single process.
[12:19:16] <jelly> no_gravity, I think the idea is to create a new container with all the fresh stuff, and replace the old one
[12:19:20] <mrjpaxton[m]> Well, I mean... any updates I personally want to check to make sure they work. But each to their own.
[12:19:56] <no_gravity> jelly: The process of "create a new container with all the fresh stuff" would involve update/upgrade as well.
[12:20:19] <mrjpaxton[m]> Containers are cool that way.
[12:20:23] <no_gravity> So as a workaround I am using this now: apt update -y && apt install -y dialog && apt upgrade -y

[12:21:02] <no_gravity> jelly: Maybe. But without update/upgrade nothing works in these images in my experience.
[12:21:03] <jelly> no_gravity, okay, then use apt-get not apt, and make it as noninteractive as possible.
[12:21:12] <no_gravity> jelly: Oh! Good idea!
[12:21:20] <jelly> apt is NOT meant to be used for automation
[12:21:28] <no_gravity> jelly: Yay! True!
[12:21:42] <themill> it still shouldn't need dialog installed for this
[12:22:12] <themill> telling debconf not to try to talk to you at all (DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive) is better
[12:22:13] <no_gravity> jelly: Damn! Same error with apt-get!
[12:22:13] <mrjpaxton[m]> I also learned it is really convoluted to try to make a Debian custom live ISO work with both UEFI and traditional BIOS, turns out the hack is to install both GRUB and syslinux in specific ways.
[12:22:41] <mrjpaxton[m]> And then I broke it with `apt install init`, because it was in a chroot.
[12:22:46] <mrjpaxton[m]> Man am I stupid.

[12:36:52] <jelly> no_gravity, you might make a note that the commands are like that to account for Debian's docker images, which are somewhat crippled compared to a normal installation.
[12:37:24] <no_gravity> jelly: What do you mean by "crippled compared to a normal installation"?
[12:37:36] <jelly> missing important bits, like whiptail
[12:37:46] <no_gravity> How is whiptail important here?
[12:38:49] <jelly> it being present would make debconf complain less.
[12:39:30] <no_gravity> jelly: Doesn't DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive do the same?
[12:39:57] <mrjpaxton[m]> So, I thought Debian had package defaults, so that certain things wouldn't need to be prompted by the user at all. Most of the changes in /etc/defaults are from whatever prompts you get from upgraded/installed packages, right? So why can't there be defaults shipped out for packages?
[12:40:22] <mrjpaxton[m]> To me it sounds like no_gravity never wants to be prompted by anything, so he's wondering why he'd even need dialog/whiptail in the first place.

[12:40:40] <jelly> no_gravity, yes, but that's an unusual thing to set for an interactive tutorial, and deserves an explanation perhaps
[12:41:12] <no_gravity> jelly: I added this info now: # In the Debian docker image, no dialog program is installed. This sometimes makes apt upgrade throw warnings. To prevent that we tell debian we are in noninteractive mode. An alternative would be to install dialog or whiptail via "apt install whiptail" or "apt install dialog" before the apt upgrade.

[12:45:13] <jelly> if you want interactive, there's probably no need for -y, but let the user see what apt is asking
[12:45:53] <mrjpaxton[m]> Not to toot Debian's features so much, but even doing a Debootstrap chroot would be a lot easier than a Docker container, and probably much less restrictive. But I guess that defeats the whole point of Docker... I've never liked trying to run GUI programs with Docker, all the X forwarding stuff involved. But I guess that's not the point of it.
[12:45:57] <jelly> and if it's a user well acquainted with debian you'd just say "first, make sure your system is up to date"
[12:46:07] <no_gravity> jelly: I don't want interactive. The update/upgrade command is just to go from the fresh image to something that can install packages.
[12:46:41] <no_gravity> jelly: Without the "apt update && apt upgrade", "apt install python3-django" fails with "E: Unable to locate package python3-django".
[12:46:55] <jelly> then maybe stay away from /usr/bin/apt whose behaviour is not fixed in stone

[12:58:21] <jelly> mrjpaxton[m], they use them already, and lean distros like alpine are more common than debian as a platform there
[12:58:24] <mrjpaxton[m]> Containers are mostly designed to pop up and use, then configure with text files. Containers were never really designed with the mindset of having to install or muck around with them too much. they're designed to be created, integrated, copied, destroyed, etc... like its own process.

[13:01:34] <mrjpaxton[m]> Vagrant is also a very fast VM, but it's also not a container, just like Docker is not a VM. Comparing them is silly since they are not the same thing. Lol.
[13:01:55] <mrfb> vagrant is not a vm
[13:02:02] <mrjpaxton[m]> I mean Qemu even emulates system hardware, which is extra stuff, that people might (or might not) need.
[13:02:04] <no_gravity> mrjpaxton[m]: "vm replacement" is a term I like to use.

[13:05:57] <mrfb> as today's standards, not using containers in your workflow is like driving a Mule on a highway

[13:06:57] <mrfb> from small startups to big companies, or freelancers, having to manual-setup things is a waste of time and resources
[13:07:23] <mrjpaxton[m]> I mean... sure. I just wish I knew more about it.
[13:07:44] <mrfb> well, it's not like being gatekeeped somehow, you can learn if you want
[13:07:51] *** Joins: ice9 (~ice9@user/ice9)
[13:08:26] <mrfb> but just dont manual install things, even workflows like wordpress development, (classic lamp setups) is done today with containers
[13:08:56] *** Joins: CJ- (~CJ-@2a01:7e00:e001:ee00:ea6f:38ff:fed3:f969)
[13:09:18] <mrjpaxton[m]> Most of the software I use is just programs, I don't launch any services that would need to be containerized. My custom router that I built uses simple software, like nftables, dnsmasq, systemd-networkd, wireguard. Most of those don't need to be in a container.
[13:09:22] <no_gravity> Containers are so awesome for development. When you give a codebase to a developer and they are like "how do I get this to work?" you can reply "docker run -it debian:11-slim" and it works.
[13:09:25] <jelly> doing a manual setup is still an important part of learning how pieces fit together
[13:09:35] <mrfb> yeah, that's correct
[13:09:41] <mrjpaxton[m]> So it seems like it isn't fitting my use case yet, unless I want to experiment with serving something.
[13:10:09] <mrfb> but after the learning part, there is a process to adapt to what's the industry is doing right now, so you won't leave behind
[13:10:10] <mrjpaxton[m]> For my NAS, it's just NFS, and doing that in a container is also silly.
[13:10:28] <mrfb> I have my NAS setup wth proxmox
[13:10:34] <mrfb> every service is an VM
[13:10:54] <mrjpaxton[m]> jelly: I can drink to that. :)
[13:11:12] <mrjpaxton[m]> I also have never done Linux From Scratch before, and I feel sad.
[13:11:17] <mrjpaxton[m]> Haha.
[13:11:47] <jelly> lfs is a bit silly, things weren't done like that back in the day
[13:12:46] <jelly> 23 floppies, now that's the way
[13:12:58] <mrfb> mrjpaxton[m]: The point of containers is about having the same environment everywhere
[13:12:59] <mrjpaxton[m]> It's still the best way to learn how Linux works and ticks.
[13:13:40] <mrjpaxton[m]> mrfb: Yeah, that's what I mean. The manageability sounds very nice.
[13:13:48] <mrfb> I mean, there is no point on using them on a NAS, forexample
[13:14:20] <mrfb> unless you develop those services, and you want development and production match 
[13:14:24] <mrjpaxton[m]> Though for one person, without a lot of services to host, I don't really feel like I need anything like Proxmox.
[13:14:55] <mrfb> I have at thome some stuff like parental filtering, a pihole, the NFS server
[13:15:06] <mrfb> I used proxmox to separate that stuff
[13:15:15] *** Quits: diiirt (~diiirt@user/diiirt) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:15:28] <mrfb> I can move them outside that server just migrating the image
[13:15:35] *** Joins: diiirt (~diiirt@user/diiirt)
[13:16:49] <mrfb> not necessary, but its easier to manage
[13:17:50] <mrfb> I can also upgrade them without compromissing other services, if I screw up the pihole e.g. other services keep runing fine
[13:19:22] <mrfb> mrjpaxton[m]: I can give you ideas for things to host :), like your own mail server, a media server, ads network filter, DNS server over https, so, a lot of oportunity to side-projects and learn new stuff

[13:24:26] <mrjpaxton[m]> Hmm... Well the media server is kind of solved with my NAS already. But right now my NAS and router are combined together (don't ask). I did this so it would save power, save money, and fit it in a very small space. And of course, I have everything backed up, so if there were any problems, I could just reflash to my ARM board that runs my router/NAS.

[20:18:12] <somiaj> cadmio: I would check out the docs that I pointed you at, also I'm unsure if allow-hotplug makes much sense for a wifi device, I just use 'auto'
[20:18:25] <somiaj> is this a usb dongle you want to automatically enable when you plug it in?
[20:18:57] <cadmio> it's a wireless adaptor that connects to a wifi AP
[20:19:28] <somiaj> So it is an internal device? What does your 'there is no usb0 part' comment referencing?
[20:20:04] <cadmio> so it's external.. but I use also my phone to connect through usc0
[20:20:07] <cadmio> *usb0
[20:20:16] <somiaj> oh so it is a teathered device?
[20:20:40] <somiaj> Anyways, this is out of my experience, but the documenation that I pointed to is nice for wpasupplicant, roam mode and using it with the interfaces file
[20:20:57] <cadmio> they are two separates devices: 1) wifi adaptor 2) teathere smartphone 
[20:21:22] <somiaj> though I'm unsure on your exact use case, you may find roam mode not what you want and just hard code the stuff in your interfaces file using wpa-ssid and wpa-psk as per the document sney linked
[20:21:41] <somiaj> and then just manualy ifup/ifdown the device as you need it
[20:21:57] <bgardner> Good morning #debian; I upgraded a server from buster to bullseye recently and while it appears to generally work fine, it's begun to worryingly lockup hard after heavy encrypt/read/write activities (that previously worked fine on buster).  It's a genuinely hard lock that requires a poweroff, so nothing at all in the logs to guide me - what would be my best approach to begin diagnosing this?  The only interestingly complex 
[20:21:59] <bgardner> part of this system that might relate is that it has a 6-disk mdadm RAID5 volume for /home.

[22:39:37] <antto> i wanted to copy some chunk of the output of lsusb to the clipboard.. i can do it with the mouse but it's too many lines so it doesn't fit on one screen

[22:41:09] <somiaj> would redirecting it to a file work, blah > file.txt, then open the file.txt in xorg?
[22:41:20] <antto> oh, rightclicking does it

(and then ideally bisect the kernel commits and submit a bug when you find the bad one, though if you find some working 5.8 then that may be a medium-term option as well)

[23:58:23] <bgardner> n4dir: If that was to me, yes, it is a server.  It mostly sits here and primarily provides a RAID volume for backups and a few other light network services (named, ntp, etc).
[23:58:56] <jhutchins> bgardner: Very odd.  Any chance it's a hardware problem?
