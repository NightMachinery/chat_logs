[01:40:52] <Bco1981> that's probably a good price by todays standards
[01:41:20] <Bco1981> but the rumor is that more is coming
[01:41:54] <Bco1981> nvidia is ramping up, and used cards are starting to come down in price

[02:11:29] <Bco1981> i hope that is a standard vs. pro edition, and you still can do offline account on pro.
[02:12:40] <Sxem> seems weird that theyre requiring a front facing camera for windows 11 for everything except desktop pcs
[02:12:56] <Sxem> are they going to insist you login with your face from now on?
[02:13:12] <marblesurf> that can't be true
[02:13:19] <Bco1981> i really wouldn't be surprised
[02:13:41] <marblesurf> me neither but still, that can't be true lol

[02:15:20] <Sxem> Not just any camera will cut it, as the tech company says, it must be an HD device, with Auto-Exposure.
[02:15:33] <Sxem> Another specification to keep in mind is that the webcam needs to have a 1280x720 resolution, with more than 15 FPS.

[02:15:58] <snake> ButterNoodle, resell the onaholes
[02:16:00] <snake> thank me later
[02:16:08] <snake> bbiab, gonna shower
[02:16:31] <Sxem> this requirement will become mandatory starting with the 1st of January, 2023, a fact which will most likely force many of the manufacturers to also include a webcam in devices like laptops or tablets.
[02:16:51] <Sxem> did microsoft buy all the webcam companies and want to make extra money?
[02:17:05] <marblesurf> that's unreal
[02:17:14] <Bco1981> Hardware buttons: Power button and volume up and down buttons required... what pc case has that ?
[02:17:31] <Sxem> they  also wants the webcam to have support for auto white balance and auto exposure.
[02:17:51] <Sxem> the camera button must be able to wake up the device when needed.
[02:17:59] <Bco1981> Sxem: the webcam is not on the "basic requirements" list
[02:18:13] <Bco1981> that's feature-specific requirements
[02:18:20] <Sxem> the camera is optional at first, then mandatory in 2023

[02:26:43] <marblesurf> reckon more people are going to make the switch now
[02:27:14] <marblesurf> this is the year of the linux desktop guys!!!1
[02:28:07] <Bco1981> the problem is, linux is a bit lacking in the steam library support... and dx9-12
[02:32:17] <marblesurf> muh games
[02:32:20] <Roey> dx2-66
[02:32:26] <Roey> that was my first 486
[02:32:55] <Bco1981> amazing times... barely needed any cooling
[02:34:38] <marblesurf> most of the games i care about either work natively on linux or work with proton OOTB
[02:34:57] <Roey> Bco1981: yeah -but- couldn't play mp3s, or quake1
[02:35:07] <Bco1981> lol no
[02:35:29] <emmeka> yeah, I game exclusively on linux and with all the work Steam has put into proton, essentially everything works now
[02:35:44] <emmeka> plus lots more things have native linux versions
[02:35:57] <emmeka> it's come a long way since even 2, 3 years ago
[02:36:16] <marblesurf> yeah it really is getting better everyday
[02:36:17] <Roey> saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame
[02:36:19] <Roey> like,
[02:36:24] <S_T_A_N> I keep hearing that every 2, 3 years
[02:36:32] <Bco1981> lol
[02:36:34] <Roey> due to Steam Proton, I finally was able to play Skyrim on my systm
[02:36:55] <Roey> noce i Get a modern video card, I'll be able to play gta5 and doom eternal
[02:37:00] <marblesurf> i very rarely use steam, but yesterday i bought worms armageddon which works with proton OOTB
[02:37:01] <Roey> and skyrim deluxe
[02:37:02] <emmeka> S_T_A_N well, that's because it's continuously improved. But before, you generally had to toy with wine a bit to get anything working, and maintain a separate Windows version of Steam through wine for this.
[02:37:08] <emmeka> now this is unnecessary
[02:37:10] <Roey> because now I only have a 750 ti
[02:37:31] <emmeka> essentially everything just works via proton, and the few things that don't can be made to work with some tweaking if you really care.
[02:37:38] <marblesurf> though most of the time i'm fine with retroarch since i'm more into retro gaming
[02:38:21] <marblesurf> emmeka which distro do you use?
[02:38:28] <emmeka> fedora
[02:38:40] <marblesurf> ah word, never tried it
[02:39:19] <marblesurf> i convinced a friend this week to dual boot w*ndows with pop_os
[02:39:37] <marblesurf> never tried it but seems like a good distro for a beginner 
[02:39:42] <marblesurf> sort of like a sane ubuntu
[02:39:49] <emmeka> out of all the distros I've tried it's the one that seems to break the least while still being fast and not bloated (I run xfce)
[02:40:15] <marblesurf> i'm running arch
[02:40:59] <emmeka> I've never tried to run arch and I feel like I'm too much of a pleb to do so, even if I know my way around a command line decently enough
[02:41:29] <Bco1981> manjarp is arch, was very easy
[02:41:35] <Bco1981> manjaro*
[02:41:47] <emmeka> Manjaro seems ok but breakable
[02:42:01] <Bco1981> anything is breakable
[02:42:14] <marblesurf> i installed it with this https://sourceforge.net/projects/arch-linux-gui/ , worked mostly fine. the installer isn't hard at all really, "just read the wiki"
[02:42:15] <ImoutoBot> [title] Arch Linux GUI download | SourceForge.net
[02:42:32] <marblesurf> also endeavourOS exists which is practically arch
[02:42:49] <marblesurf> and yeah emmeka i've ran manjaro a few times and i always run into problems i just don't run into using arch
[02:43:36] <emmeka> Bco1981 it is, but with fedora I generally only break things if I do something obviously stupid, and it seems to strike the right balance of stable/secure and up to date.

[04:36:15] <PancakeMatsuri> it's 17C today
[04:36:38] <mathu> i'm from michigan which is usually a little hotter and way more humid than seattle, so seattle summer isn't too bad without A/C to me, but 107F with >40% humidity is going to be rough
[04:36:46] <emmeka> I can't do hot climates. I'm not genetically built for it, I guess. Every time I've went to the tropics I just get sick as hell.
[04:36:52] <ButterNoodle> its almost 30 here
[04:36:59] <mathu> i think i remember <10 days in MI that broke 100F at all
[04:37:24] <mathu> (in seattle there have been 3 >100F days since they started measuring)

[04:37:43] <ButterNoodle> yes
[04:37:57] <ButterNoodle> its summer on the north side of the world
[04:38:10] <emmeka> according to the weather station 5km from here, we have an average of 8 days a year with daily maximums above 30°C.
[04:38:43] <emmeka> of those, 0.5 days a year on average are above 35°C.
[04:38:46] <MootPoot> emmeka:  even in my cold wasteland home without AC it gets way too fucking hot
[04:38:56] <MootPoot> but thats due to the 9 computers lol
[04:39:05] <MootPoot> its 27C here atm
[04:39:12] <MootPoot> I just got back from errands, got cooked

[04:39:39] <mathu> my apartment isn't laid out in a way that gets any airflow RIP
[04:39:40] <MootPoot> but then there is no gurantee of privacy while fapping
[04:39:41] <emmeka> also, it's an old ass house so literally every single room has a ceiling fan
[04:39:45] <MootPoot> oh god
[04:39:55] <MootPoot> not that shitty pathetic single center fan
[04:39:55] <emmeka> there's one in every bedroom, the kitchen, the living room, and the dining room
[04:39:59] <MootPoot> that does basically nothign
[04:40:08] <MootPoot> I have those
[04:40:17] <emmeka> they're even made out of that glorious 70s fake wood and brass
[04:40:23] <MootPoot> They're not fans really, they are more like the idea of a fan
[04:40:50] <emmeka> they circulate air within the room, which basically helps move the air along from the screens.
[04:40:54] <emmeka> works for that purpose
[04:41:23] <MootPoot> if a fan cant blow some skirts up, its not a fan

[07:37:34] <Sadale> I've heard that they've put tighter restriction on civilian firearm tho. It affected RedPhoenix, one of our old users here.

[07:38:56] <MootPoot> Even the famously "there are no guns in Japan" japan can own guns 
[07:39:21] <MootPoot> It's more of a pain to get and you have more restrictions however.

[07:56:41] <emmeka> Sadale there are basically two classes of firearms here, "non-restricted" (basic hunting longarms, non-automatic), and "restricted" (all pistols, semi-auto rifles, anything that looks vaguely military). The recent new restrictrions were on the restricted class, which requires extra licensing and most people don't have it anyway.
[07:56:56] <Sadale> ah!
[07:57:03] <emmeka> getting a non-restricted license is pretty trivial and there's few limits on those kinds of guns
[07:57:32] <emmeka> besides things like "you can't carry it around unlocked and loaded" and "you need to store ammo and your guns separately, under lock and key"
[07:59:04] <MootPoot> Also, it can't be black or scary looking 
[07:59:34] <MootPoot> Plenty of formerly NRs got pushed to Rs for that 
[07:59:59] <emmeka> yeah they don't like anything that "looks" military
[08:00:14] <emmeka> even if functionally, it fits non-restricted regulations
[08:00:35] <MootPoot> Need to get together a group that only owns bright pink rainbow painted guns 
[08:00:44] <MootPoot> That'll work

[08:00:54] <MootPoot> Wat
[08:01:03] <MootPoot> You better not be shitting me 
[08:01:05] <emmeka> basically: a gay gun club.
[08:01:18] <emmeka> it is a real thing. a self-proclaimed LGBT self-defence organization.
[08:01:30] <emmeka> they typically have pink guns
[08:01:57] <emmeka> membership ~10,000
[08:02:08] <MootPoot> Fuck, I wonder if I join that 
[08:02:16] <MootPoot> Trudeau will let me keep my stuff 
[08:02:21] <MootPoot> We need publicity though 
[08:02:45] <MootPoot> I got a bunch of mags for my 22lr bolt gun 
[08:03:00] <MootPoot> Trying to find farmers that'll let me pop rabbits on their land 
[08:03:01] <Sxem> maybe it would cut down on gun violence if only pink guns were legal. all these macho dudes would refuse to own guns, and if someone did pull a gun, itd be much more noticeable
[08:03:19] <Sxem> neon pink
[08:03:28] <MootPoot> But then all the cops and the army would also have to be gay
[08:03:37] <MootPoot> Lmao
[08:03:40] <emmeka> MootPoot I fail to see the problem
[08:04:00] <Sxem> the police wd be less likely draw their guns so less innocent black ppl wd get gunned down every day
[08:04:03] <MootPoot> I thought the lgbt community has a bad history with millitary and police as a general

[08:07:44] <MootPoot> And?
[08:07:56] <MootPoot> Plenty of people in Canada don't know guns are legal here 
[08:08:22] <MootPoot> https://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/russia.php#:~:text=Russian%20citizens%20have%20the%20right,as%20stated%20in%20the%20license.
[08:08:22] <ImoutoBot> [title] Firearms-Control Legislation and Policy: Russian Federation | Law Library of Congress
[08:08:26] <CyberTailor> you can get only non-fatal weapons legally
[08:08:33] <MootPoot> Russian citizens have the right to acquire and possess weapons according to rules established by legislation.  These rules allow citizens of the Russian Federation who are eighteen years of age and older to apply for a license that would allow an individual to possess weapons of a specific type as stated in the license
[08:08:42] <MootPoot> No, you can own firearms 
[08:08:48] <MootPoot> Guns with bullets 
[08:08:49] <CyberTailor> you can't
[08:09:01] <emmeka> checking quickly, Russian laws are a bit weird, but don't prohibit gun ownership. Basically your initial license only permits smoothbores - ie, shotguns - and after 5 years of holding that license you can get a full license for rifles.
[08:09:31] <emmeka> but you can just get a license to own a shotgun pretty simply, by the looks of it
[08:09:44] <MootPoot> There is a weird subclass of guns due to that actually 
[08:09:55] <CyberTailor> you can't carry it
[08:09:56] <emmeka> hell, you even have carrying permits (for licensed hunters only)
[08:10:22] <MootPoot> There is a Russian gun/caliber ... EKO. Something bjt basically anything smoothbore= shotgun legally 
[08:10:36] <MootPoot> So they take AKs and then give them half-rifles barrels 
[08:10:39] <emmeka> CyberTailor what I'm reading says you can, but, only with a valid hunting license and only for valid hunting longarms. This seems basically analogous to our system besides the weird "only shotguns at first" rule.
[08:10:39] <CyberTailor> you can't carry it for self-defense
[08:10:44] <MootPoot> Not rifled all the way 
[08:10:47] <emmeka> CyberTailor so?
[08:10:50] <emmeka> you can't here either.
[08:10:57] <emmeka> the only place that allows that is the US.
[08:11:01] <MootPoot> So AKs but mostly smoothbore lol
[08:11:06] <emmeka> and even then it's patchy by state
[08:11:55] <CyberTailor> anyway, our police doesn't know about laws
[08:12:01] <MootPoot> This report focuses on the circulation of civilian weapons, which can be used by Russian citizens for purposes of self-defense, hunting, and sports activities.  
[08:12:02] <CyberTailor> it just arrests you
[08:12:14] <CyberTailor> and courts don't know laws too
[08:12:14] <MootPoot> You can have a gun for self defense
[08:12:19] <MootPoot> ....
[08:12:29] <emmeka> I'm pretty sure there are many tens of thousands of licensed hunters with carry permits in Russia.
[08:12:44] <CyberTailor> i misunderstood something
[08:13:00] <MootPoot> I like how we went from "Russia guns are illegal" to "not lethal weapons" to "not for carrying" to "not for self defense" 
[08:13:06] <emmeka> and yeah, this even seems to suggest that self-defence is a valid reason to apply for a license... you just still have to go through the weird smoothbore-first system
[08:13:07] <MootPoot> Lol
[08:13:21] <emmeka> and you can't CARRY a gun for that reason, but so?
[08:13:24] <MootPoot> You can do a lot with a smooth bore 
[08:13:31] <MootPoot> Rifled slugs anyone?
[08:13:54] <emmeka> MootPoot yeah idk it seems sort of weird to me to say that somebody can have a 12ga right away, but they have to wait to be able to shoot a .22...

[08:21:41] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: yea in any developed cuntry thats not the US.. there is considerable license and cost associated w long guns for hunting.. I looked up a lil bit on huntin in japan

[12:53:10] <DunceCotus> amigojapan and not dunce?
[12:54:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I didn't quite buy that they repeated it for 15,000 times.. I feel like that was a little too unbelievable
[12:54:38] <DunceCotus> if it was 8 repetitions it would still work I think
[12:54:50] <DunceCotus> and the number of episodes on it would make more sense
[12:55:32] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I see. Hmm I did not think that was a problem
[12:56:03] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: everything haruhi does is over the top
[12:56:08] <MootPoot> hmm
[12:56:11] <MootPoot> can I npm on a mac

[12:57:07] <mexen> I imagine you can
[12:57:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan true but I feel like they would have broken out of it earlier, or Kyon would have had the idea to do homework with the gang before then..
[12:57:48] <mexen> homebrew 
[12:58:10] <amigojapan> I see DunceCotus 
[12:58:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan if the 8 episodes were more of a gradual build-up of deja vu and kyon becoming more desperate at the end of each repetition, that might have worked
[12:58:56] <DunceCotus> but most of the episodes were superfluous
[12:59:40] <MootPoot> hmm
[12:59:42] <DunceCotus> I mean they could have still done 15,000 times but had first episode at like 100 times, second 1000, third 5000, fourth 10,000 etc.
[12:59:57] <MootPoot> the M1 is cool and all but that 17 inch LG gram looking fine
[13:00:10] <MootPoot> I wonder if it also has a good trackpad and gestures
[13:00:12] <MootPoot> and not-laggy
[13:00:39] <amigojapan> I see DunceCotus , personally I rather repeat the winter vacations. It's too hot in the summer in Japan
[13:00:48] <MootPoot> I bought a 20 dollar dock so I can plug usb A and hdmi into the mac
[13:01:05] <MootPoot> the dock plugs in to both of the usb C ports together

[15:59:01] <dfch> lastonestanding, depends where in tibet you refer to, if equally rural areas, then no, if you comparing to cities (i.e. Lhasa) in tibet, then yes by a huge margin.
[16:00:33] <dfch> lastonestanding, but there's not much of a difference tbh, rural sichuan (especially western part of the province which neighbors with tibet) is almost equally got beautiful nature, underpopulated, and yes, poor.

[17:04:55] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: so today my father asked why do you want to earn money, what are your ambitions and what not

[17:05:08] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, why me in particular?
[17:05:21] <HubertFarnsworth> what?
[17:05:40] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, oh. you mean your father asked you (not me) why you want to make money, your ambitions, etc.
[17:06:06] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: so I told him that I just want enough money to live comfortably to which he said then you don't need to work
[17:06:08] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: that day anyway went by
[17:06:14] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, lol bullshit
[17:06:31] <HubertFarnsworth> he said I don't have any goals and ambitions
[17:06:34] <Sadale> As if the money just grew on the tree in your backyard!
[17:06:38] <HubertFarnsworth> what shit is that?
[17:06:50] <HubertFarnsworth> are we school kids?
[17:06:53] <HubertFarnsworth> goals?
[17:06:56] <emmeka> does one need to have a goal or ambition to work besides "basically survive"
[17:07:05] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[17:07:07] <emmeka> this is, effectively, what the vast majority of the working population strives for
[17:07:14] <Sadale> bullshit means nonsense. It means that what he said is unfounded and unjustified and dumb and stupid
[17:07:54] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: years ago you told me about a remote factory job in Canada, is it still there?
[17:08:02] <amigojapan> Hi emmeka 
[17:08:26] <HubertFarnsworth> the place that has no internet and absolute cold af
[17:08:41] <emmeka> uhhhhh I'm not sure what job that would be
[17:08:50] <HubertFarnsworth> I can't deal with my parents anymore
[17:08:56] <emmeka> also it clearly has internet, I'm talking to you right now
[17:09:52] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: I don't remember exactly but the place is remote, it is very cold, no internet and hardly anything else is there..
[17:10:16] <amigojapan> The North pole
[17:10:20] <HubertFarnsworth> I mean in the location of job
[17:10:22] <emmeka> sounds like where I live.
[17:11:13] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I mean are you a Canadian citizen, it's not like you can just "move to Canada" on a whim the way Americans seem to think you can.
[17:11:45] <HubertFarnsworth> no emmeka, I am not. I can't move like that.
[17:11:50] <HubertFarnsworth> I need visa
[17:12:02] <amigojapan> Or almost every country

[17:12:55] <Sadale> some countries has visa-free access. But they have a limited staying duration.
[17:12:57] <emmeka> we have visa-free travel with many euro countries, but that's short-term and not for work.
[17:13:13] <Sadale> If your visa-free travel is expired, you have to leave
[17:13:37] <emmeka> Europeans get no preferential treatment in immigration here besides broadly being educated and speaking the official languages. It's a points-based system.
[17:13:57] <amigojapan> Even Japan has visa fee travel from certain countries
[17:14:11] <HubertFarnsworth> the tution fees for Europeans are quite less compared to asians
[17:14:31] <Sadale> you sure about that?
[17:14:43] <HubertFarnsworth> tution fees?
[17:14:49] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[17:15:43] <emmeka> no, they're not.
[17:15:47] <emmeka> well.
[17:16:02] <emmeka> I do know of one exception, France has educational agreements with Québec.
[17:16:14] <HubertFarnsworth> maybe they have changed, it was back in 2011
[17:16:19] <emmeka> but I don't know whether that extends to tuition costs, I just know it makes it easier.
[17:16:26] <Sadale> maybe that's the case if you're a local student. But if you're an international student the European ones are probably more expensive
[17:16:39] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth afaik, in 2011, all foreigners paid the same international tuition.
[17:16:55] <emmeka> Americans, Europeans, Asians, they all get the same. I knew plenty of yanks who complained about it.
[17:17:00] <Sadale> If you get scholarship tho you may be able to study free everywhere

[17:18:39] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: the most one can get is T.A in university
[17:19:28] <Sadale> Oh. Here in Hong Kong being a T.A. is only possible if you're having a master degree. It's a level above the bachelor degree.
[17:20:03] <HubertFarnsworth> I was thinking about masters as well.

[17:59:49] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, Doubt that. But I'm not quite sure
[18:00:43] <HubertFarnsworth> nah, the website says low tax rates
[18:01:01] <HubertFarnsworth> and low cost of living
[18:01:25] <Sadale> I think PH would probably have lower cost of living than Vanuatu.
[18:01:32] <HubertFarnsworth> wait, it says, Tax-free country (other than the indirect taxes of VAT and Customs)
[18:01:42] <HubertFarnsworth> so...
[18:01:48] <HubertFarnsworth> that's good right?
[18:02:01] <Sadale> I mean Vanuatu is an island country in a remote part of the ocean. Most of the supply would have to get delivered by sea. It can make stuffs expensive.
[18:02:16] <HubertFarnsworth> it's close to Aus
[18:02:24] <Sadale> And Aus' expensive

[18:15:29] <HubertFarnsworth> I am no Saudi prince Sadale 
[18:15:30] <Sadale> It just cost $20000, plus an annual fee of $400ish
[18:16:08] <Sadale> It's just $20000. Not sure if it'd be easy for Indian to afford that tho. To me $20000's totally worth it if I plan to move there for retirement.
[18:17:06] <HubertFarnsworth> my reason for getting visa of other countries is to live in a different country, not in that country

[18:23:33] <HubertFarnsworth> that's fucking great snake
[18:23:35] <snake> Sadale, it will be, dw
[18:24:02] <snake> after all, it's not just the piece of paper, but the knowledge you gain along the way
[18:24:09] <HubertFarnsworth> I didn't complete bachelors as well. Can't go back to studies now.

[18:26:29] <snake> saganman: how is the brick business?
[18:26:50] <HubertFarnsworth> bad snake, the workers left during covid pandemic
[18:26:51] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, When you talked about how bad Indian passport were I thought about telling you to ask saganman because he does business. But saganman weren't online so I didn't say that.
[18:26:54] <snake> oof
[18:26:58] <Sadale> And it turns out that you're saganman
[18:27:24] <snake> "what would saganman do" - HubertFarnsworth 
[18:27:28] <dfch> Sadale, one still can talk to themselves ;)
[18:27:28] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah and not just that, we have issues with quality as well
[18:27:53] <snake> HubertFarnsworth, how can you improve quality and begin making bricks again?
[18:28:21] <HubertFarnsworth> protein powder
[18:28:43] <Sadale> lol if he had figured out how this project would be a success.
[18:28:45] <snake> like the stuff you use for MUSCLE MILK you buy at the store?
[18:28:45] <amigojapan> I am being asked to watch the first communion of my niece live on Facebook... Tomorrow when I have work

[18:29:27] <snake> o yeah
[18:29:32] <snake> im inivisible >.>
[18:29:33] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't know the details about that but the consultant said protein powder and another consultant says no
[18:29:36] <Sadale> or just tell your niece to fuck off :P
[18:29:38] <snake> hmph!
[18:29:50] <snake> HubertFarnsworth, oof
[18:30:05] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, it sucks donkey's balls
[18:30:13] <amigojapan> Sadale: I will just say "I have work, sorry
[18:30:14] <HubertFarnsworth> and real estate is in slump
[18:30:21] <snake> joke's on you, i'm into that shit
[18:30:28] <HubertFarnsworth> the cost of steel, cement has risen
[18:30:35] <HubertFarnsworth> labour cost too
[18:30:59] <HubertFarnsworth> worst of all, most IT people now work from home
[18:31:19] <Sadale> sad
[18:31:24] <dfch> ale
[18:31:29] <snake> HubertFarnsworth, "how can i make bricks again" "how can i improve quality"
[18:31:36] <snake> think about it
[18:31:40] <snake> you will find the answers
[18:31:47] <HubertFarnsworth> yes
[18:32:51] <Sadale> I've got a 3D printer. I guess I could print bricks for HubertFarnsworth and sell them for $100 a brick :P
[18:32:58] <HubertFarnsworth> there is another project going too snake, more money into that
[18:33:05] <snake> oo
[18:33:05] <dfch> + shipping
[18:33:13] <snake> HubertFarnsworth, what is the other project?
[18:33:16] <HubertFarnsworth> can you make anime figurines Sadale?
[18:33:27] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, probably not. The quality of the 3D printer is not good enough.
[18:33:43] <snake> hubert wants a dragon loli lewd figurine
[18:33:46] <Sadale> It's technically possible. But it'd look real bad. And the printed fingurines would be very weak and would be easy to break
[18:33:53] <snake> hubert sagan fansworth man
[18:34:17] <HubertFarnsworth> snake: Land development. We have bought some acres of land and should convert into plots with all specifications of government.
[18:34:30] <snake> nice
[18:34:37] <snake> commercial or?
[18:34:41] <snake> industrial?
[18:34:50] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: that seems profitable no?
[18:34:52] <HubertFarnsworth> residential 
[18:34:56] <snake> nice
[18:35:33] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: everything is profitable otherwise no one would invest in them. I don't know unforeseen problems.
[18:35:52] <HubertFarnsworth> but yeah, getting profits is the hope
[18:36:03] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: land sounds better than building development
[18:36:14] <snake> HubertFarnsworth, apartments or houses?
[18:36:45] <HubertFarnsworth> no houses or apartments snake, just open plots with roads, drainage, electricity..
[18:36:47] <HubertFarnsworth> park
[18:36:55] <snake> ah nice
[18:38:15] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I guess if Corona is affecting building development it will affect land buying too
[18:39:10] <HubertFarnsworth> It does but each of them have different markets.
[18:39:26] <HubertFarnsworth> Land is limited while apartments are countless
[18:39:31] <amigojapan> Hopefully we eventually will be over Corona
[18:39:40] <HubertFarnsworth> so a good bit of land is always in demand
[18:40:02] <amigojapan> I see HubertFarnsworth 
[18:40:31] <HubertFarnsworth> and the kind of apartments we construct are for middle class people who are buying their first property in city

[19:33:54] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't remember amigojapan. There is reboot of Frasier.

[19:34:41] <HubertFarnsworth> it is not like the other scifi show amigojapan 
[19:34:42] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I watched all of Picard. It was so so
[19:35:54] <HubertFarnsworth> what's different about expanse series is the things and most of the stuff are almost relatable to reality. The politics, system, society except for the hyper drive technology
[19:36:30] <amigojapan> Is that for space travel?

[20:47:37] <CyberTailor> it's pointless
[20:47:48] <CyberTailor> youtube comments generally make no sense
[20:48:08] <TsundereNoises> yeah, they just feed the despair about humanity
[20:48:28] <davic> TsundereNoises: help me

[20:48:38] <TsundereNoises> davic: me too!

[20:49:05] <TsundereNoises> go to store naked

[20:50:44] <HubertFarnsworth> many super market stores now have online shopping
[20:51:03] <HubertFarnsworth> what do you need to buy davic?
[20:51:04] <davic> HubertFarnsworth: Amazon in SE has no prime, more expensive than any other webshop, slow delivery (most stores here pack same day and it gets delivered the next day or the same day)
[20:51:05] <TsundereNoises> if they yell at you for shopping naked, just say "well I wouldn't have to do this if you had online shopping"
[20:51:08] <davic> HubertFarnsworth: food
[20:51:24] <davic> TsundereNoises: they do have online shopping
[20:51:30] <davic> But its delivered once a week
[20:51:33] <TsundereNoises> ah
[20:51:35] <davic> So I would get it next week
[20:51:40] <TsundereNoises> medically induced coma?
[20:51:47] <TsundereNoises> then it's LIKE instant gratification
[20:52:00] <davic> Can just buy from china then
[20:52:04] <davic> Takes so long to get delivered
[20:52:06] <davic> That you forgot
[20:52:54] <TsundereNoises> I always assume overseas mail will take basically forever, so I'm always impressed by how fast it gets here
[20:53:00] <TsundereNoises> "Wow, I only ordered this like a month ago"
[20:53:30] <HubertFarnsworth> these days it's only a week TsundereNoises 
[20:53:34] <davic> TsundereNoises: work sent shit to all employees from Portugal
[20:53:40] <luke-jr> [16:19:00] <davic> But I dont wanna put on clothes <-- YOU ANTIMASKER
[20:53:45] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: definitely not for most things
[20:53:51] <davic> Swedes got it delivered at the time we needed it
[20:53:58] <davic> But the colleagues in Portugal didnt
[20:54:04] <davic> Nor the ones in Spain
[20:54:23] <davic> luke-jr: lel, masks
[20:54:32] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: even stuff from UK to US takes longer than that, and we have a "special relationship" or whatever
[20:54:33] <davic> We have no requirement to wear masks
[20:54:51] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, I mean for Europe btw, never bought or got anything from 'merica
[20:55:19] <davic> HubertFarnsworth: the thing that takes the most time at any Amazon Warehouse
[20:55:31] <davic> Is the actual time it gets out the door
[20:55:31] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: yeah I exclusively was thinking about stuff crossing oceans
[20:55:43] <HubertFarnsworth> the last time we sent 10 kgs of all food stuff to my brother in Germany, he got it in a week
[20:56:32] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, those amazon warehouses are fucking huuge
[20:56:34] <davic> But its kinda fun, Amazon launched in Sweden, no one buys from there because its more expensive and shitty support and everything else
[20:56:50] <davic> Like, want computer parts? Buy from Inet, you get fucking candy and shit
[20:56:52] <TsundereNoises> fuck amazon
[20:57:09] <davic> Cryowolf would agree
[20:57:25] <Cryowolf> what?
[20:57:51] <Cryowolf> can you sum it up for me please?
[20:58:34] <HubertFarnsworth> what's your beef with Amazon TsundereNoises? I only know about how they treat their employees badly.
[20:58:49] <HubertFarnsworth> and also they are aggressive in competition
[20:59:25] <HubertFarnsworth> and I heard something about monopolising with AWS
[20:59:35] <Sadale> fuck amazon, and keep purchasing stuffs from it because it's cheap and fast :P
[20:59:44] <HubertFarnsworth> is AWS bad?
[20:59:58] <Sadale> Oh. I don't like AWS and cloud service of any sort. It's easy to overspend with it.
[21:00:00] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: that, and the exploitative shit they pull with book authors, and the lobbying, and driving hard to get a monopoly and own everything

[21:00:52] <Sadale> If you rent a VPS you just pay for a flat price. That's it. However with all those cloud services, you pay as you go. If you make a mistake, it could cost you a fortune
[21:01:29] <HubertFarnsworth> TsundereNoises: I didn't know that.
[21:01:47] <davic> Sadale: as a company its easier as you dont have to manage it
[21:01:52] <davic> But yeah, there are cheaper services
[21:01:55] <Sadale> true
[21:01:58] <HubertFarnsworth> publishing book on amazon is easy af btw TsundereNoises 
[21:01:58] <davic> At work we use mainly Heroku
[21:02:00] <davic> Which uses AWS
[21:02:00] <Sadale> It saves labor costs

[21:04:23] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, one can't sell it anywhere except on amazon once you agree to their terms and conditions 
[21:05:46] <HubertFarnsworth> I wonder what's it like on kobo store TsundereNoises
[21:06:12] <HubertFarnsworth> the ebooks on kobo are costly than amazon
[21:06:13] * Sadale clicks
[21:06:22] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: I mean that's awful too, but Amazon throws their weight around with publishers and book authors a lot to force them to sell to amazon at more of a discount than they can really afford, then Amazon sells it for a bigger markup
[21:06:33] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: that's the power of having a near monopoly
[21:07:13] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, that's bad shit
[21:07:16] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: basically if 2 things cost the same amount in different stores, Amazon is usually getting a bigger cut than wherever else, and the author/publisher gets a smaller cut
[21:07:31] <HubertFarnsworth> either that or market and sell your own book
[21:07:42] <TsundereNoises> and then Amazon uses that money to lobby for shitty tech laws
[21:08:17] <Sadale> davic, the artstyle doesn't look quite hongkongie. And I've spotted a simplified Chinese character in the game. Some of the simplified Chinese characters are sporadically used here. But the one I've spotted is rarely used.
[21:08:52] <HubertFarnsworth> there were laws for this to not happen in America but it still does
[21:09:16] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: yes, we've been slowly getting rid of regulation since the 70s

[21:10:45] <HubertFarnsworth> lol
[21:11:14] <TsundereNoises> they usually redefine small business to mean big business, very few "small business" policies have actually been good for truly small businesses
[21:11:54] <TsundereNoises> much like how most farm subsidies are really way better for the giant megacorporation farms, but small time farmers still will fight to the death for their bad policy ethanol subsidies that don't really help much

[21:25:41] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, oh. I misheard what he said. I thought that he said "Well you get rich by writing a lot of checks". 
[21:26:25] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[21:28:12] <HubertFarnsworth> Bill Gates made up his public image most likable compared to other billionares
[21:28:51] <HubertFarnsworth> but after the Gates divorce, lot of old stuff is coming up
[21:30:07] <TsundereNoises> I mean, he's still done a hell of a lot more good for the world than most other billionaires, in the balance, but yeah, if you were a truly great person you wouldn't be a billionaire
[21:31:12] <TsundereNoises> I remember the week Steve Jobs died, there was all this bizarre emotional reaction from so many people
[21:31:39] <Jigsy> Steve Jobs was a dick.

[21:32:07] <TsundereNoises> it was surreal

[21:33:33] <TsundereNoises> Gates foundation does a lot of actual good, which is of course good PR, but a lot of people get the good PR without actually amounting to a tenth as much

[21:38:08] <TsundereNoises> 絶望した！
[21:39:35] <Sadale> If I had a couple of millions of dollars I'd retire right away and live an internet life. Should be doable so long I don't spend too much in real life.
[21:40:40] <TsundereNoises> I'd fund the production of probably unprofitable anime that would otherwise not get made
[21:40:57] <S_T_A_N> lol. With 2 million, invested correctly, you can take out $80k give or take every year forever and never run out of money
[21:41:30] <TsundereNoises> and, let's be honest, at this point I'd probably finally succumb to temptation and blow a bunch of money on cute vtubers
[21:41:31] <Sadale> Inflation is a thing, remember.
[21:41:46] <S_T_A_N> Sadale, it's in the equation
[21:42:06] <Vohveli> TsundereNoises: I've made peace with it for now, but it's probably gonna hit hard again at the end of the month
[21:42:30] <TsundereNoises> Vohveli: her retirement date is right after my birthday, which I know shouldn't matter but it kind of makes it hit harder
[21:42:37] <Vohveli> damn :/
[21:42:42] <TsundereNoises> Vohveli: like for my birthday I get Coco's disappearance
[21:43:01] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: is that enough for retiring at 40?
[21:43:29] <HubertFarnsworth> old age and health issues are my main worry
[21:43:30] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, My retirment budget for retirement at 40 is only up to a million, assuming that the inflation is normal.
[21:43:49] <HubertFarnsworth> ugh
[21:43:50] <TsundereNoises> Vohveli: but yeah, I thought I'd made peace with it, but the Miko stream really hit me hard again, and the final one probably will too
[21:43:55] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, and yes. Fuck health issues. I'd rather not to worry about that. :P
[21:44:15] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: I hope you are investing them in something
[21:44:36] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, pre-retirement: yes. post-retirement: Probably would pick less risky investments
[21:44:51] <Vohveli> TsundereNoises: have you watched the streams/clips where she goes into the reasons a bit?
[21:45:03] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: that's why we need to get into countries like Japan, UK or Korea. Best health services.
[21:45:27] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, NO. I need to save living cost and I just pray and hope that I wouldn't run into any serious health issues :P
[21:45:48] <TsundereNoises> Vohveli: Yeah, I've seen a bit of that, but honestly I just want to watch the positive stuff for the most part
[21:46:11] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, In case of serious health problem I'd probably take euthanasia. That's the plan.
[21:46:27] <Vohveli> TsundereNoises: understandable
[21:46:39] <Sadale> And I think I should probably be semi-safe for 40-60 against serious health issues. I'm making a bet on this one.
[21:46:39] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale:  you know, I could purchase a hospice place, lol, that would be good right?
[21:46:47] <TsundereNoises> Vohveli: on that note, the Nene/Suisei karaoke stream was extremely delightful
[21:47:27] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, lol go ahead. With aging population it'll be profitable in long run :P
[21:47:50] <Vohveli> personally, it helps me cope to know that leaving was ultimately her own choice and that she has some big plans after graduation
[21:47:59] <Vohveli> TsundereNoises: I missed that, might watch the archive later
[21:48:22] <TsundereNoises> Vohveli: definitely worth watching the whole thing instead of just the songs, they goofing around between songs is really cute
[21:48:46] <TsundereNoises> and yeah, I'm glad she wasn't forced out, although I'd kind of felt that from a lot of the reactions anyway
[21:49:05] <TsundereNoises> unrelatedly, I'll probably try to check out this Kson girl a bit more sometime soon
[21:49:10] <Vohveli> yeah, it seems like pretty much everyone wanted to talk her out of it

[21:54:02] <Vohveli> I might check it out one day, but for now I wish to fully maintain the illusion
[21:54:29] <TsundereNoises> understandable
[21:54:32] <HubertFarnsworth> I can't believe Vohveli watches vtuber stuff. 
[21:54:36] <Vohveli> I've never sought out any IRL info of Vtubers beyond what they reveal on stream
[21:55:02] <theholyduck> i mean a good reason to be a vtuber is to avoid being killed by your stalker fans
[21:55:03] <theholyduck> anyway
[21:55:04] <TsundereNoises> Vohveli: I don't really seek it out, but kind of stumble across it, haven't seen as much as many apparently
[21:55:23] <theholyduck> sooo trying to figure out their secret identity seems to somewhat vilate that 
[21:56:01] <theholyduck> *violate
[21:56:20] <HubertFarnsworth> also finding out how the voice actors look would ruin vtuber image, doesn't it? what's it called? willing suspension of disbelief has to be maintained
[21:56:21] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: I agree on the hardcore doxing, but some are pretty damn obvious about it
[21:57:10] <HubertFarnsworth> are you also into vtubers theholyduck?
[21:57:15] <theholyduck> not even remotely

[21:59:14] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth: but i have no problem with produced content in general
[21:59:30] <theholyduck> i just dont like streamed stuff. its much too slow paced and boring for me
[21:59:32] <HubertFarnsworth> I mean people who review and talk about anime
[21:59:42] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth:  thats still produced
[21:59:59] <theholyduck> unless its some REALLY shitty outfit they usuually have a script
[22:00:01] <theholyduck> and do editing
[22:00:13] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: I use it as japanese listening practice, and it's pretty similar to cgdct anime honestly
[22:00:28] <TsundereNoises> the line between Lucky Star and Hololive is thinner than you might think
[22:00:35] <HubertFarnsworth> I am not heavily into them either theholyduck. Just a couple of them.
[22:00:43] <theholyduck> except a lucky star episode has like 5 jokes a minute
[22:00:52] <theholyduck> (that are good)
[22:01:01] <theholyduck> and a live stream is never even remotely as dense
[22:01:11] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: yeah I laugh quite a bit at some streams
[22:01:18] <TsundereNoises> but I guess I get what you mean
[22:01:20] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises: im not saying they are NEVER funny. 
[22:01:38] <TsundereNoises> I mean there's definitely also a quality filter, some are better than others
[22:01:41] <theholyduck> but like. a lucky star episode is 20 minutes of mostly solidly produced humor 
[22:01:46] <theholyduck> its tight
[22:02:07] <theholyduck> a vtuber streaming playing a game or whateve
[22:02:11] <theholyduck> is always going to be the opposite of tight
[22:02:23] <theholyduck> TsundereNoises:  you will notice when people post vtuber shit in here
[22:02:35] <TsundereNoises> yes, usually the best ones are 2+ people interacting rather than solo
[22:02:37] <theholyduck> 9/10 its produced content BASED on maybe a lot of streams
[22:02:47] <theholyduck> like its a 5 minute video compilation of like an 1 hour of gameplay
[22:02:51] <theholyduck> every time the character does X 
[22:02:53] <theholyduck> or whatever
[22:03:01] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: well some of that, at least on my part, is what people will watch
[22:03:10] <theholyduck> exactly
[22:03:20] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: if I want to point something out, no one's gonna watch an hour of video for it (nor should they be expected to)
[22:03:26] <theholyduck> very few people are up for. "this is going to last for god knows who long. and it might be funy at times
[22:03:37] <theholyduck> all streams are basicly that
[22:03:42] <theholyduck> and im just not intrested
[22:03:48] <TsundereNoises> and that's fine
[22:03:54] <TsundereNoises> I'm not really trying to convince you
[22:03:58] <TsundereNoises> more just explaining myself
[22:04:08] <HubertFarnsworth> wait, aren't people are into this because of moe?
[22:04:21] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: moe + humor
[22:04:26] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: hence my cgdct comparison
[22:04:37] <HubertFarnsworth> but the main element is moe right?
[22:04:44] <TsundereNoises> depends
[22:04:53] <TsundereNoises> some are pretty damn funny
[22:05:32] <Vohveli> for me it's that they are entertaining people with genuine reactions and interactions
[22:06:02] <theholyduck> i sleep 8 hours a day. i work like 38 hours a week. i spend some of the rest driving around and the 70 or so hours left to me a week i would rather spend on something more densly entertaining to me
[22:06:02] <TsundereNoises> and I think some of it is also that too, there's an element of hanging out to it
[22:06:20] <HubertFarnsworth> I only watched this one video of vtuber reading restaurant menu, it was okay
[22:06:30] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: I actually more-or-less agree with you in most cases
[22:06:53] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: like I try not to spend much time on books/shows I'm not enjoying
[22:07:23] <theholyduck> i try to spend like 2 afternoons a week hanging out at the makerspace to do projects and teach people how to use dangerous machines
[22:07:53] <theholyduck> and rarely am i doing anything that synergizes well with a livestream in the background

[22:13:26] <HubertFarnsworth> I am reading Dune again so that I would be ready to judge the upcoming movie.
[22:13:51] <TsundereNoises> I can already judge the new movie
[22:13:53] <TsundereNoises> IT STINKS
[22:14:03] <HubertFarnsworth> Lol
[22:14:16] <Vohveli> is it a remake or a sequel?
[22:14:49] <HubertFarnsworth> New movie, part of two movie series based on books.
[22:15:51] <Vohveli> I saw the old one recently, it was pretty bizarre
[22:16:00] <Vohveli> the books are probably a lot better
[22:16:06] <TsundereNoises> absolutely
[22:16:10] <TsundereNoises> I loved the book
[22:16:18] <TsundereNoises> although read it back in high school, it's been a long time
[22:17:11] <TsundereNoises> I didn't know they'd greenlit production of a 2nd movie as part of the deal, that gives me even more confidence that it'll suck
[22:18:14] <TsundereNoises> either they'll try to split the book in 2, which will be a disaster, or they'll use one of the sequel books for the movie, and the sequels weren't really necessary in the first place, and will take away from the movie if the director tries to tie them together, which they almost certainly will
[22:18:28] <TsundereNoises> too much plot to get through to set up sequel hooks

[22:19:38] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: the sequels were the point, originally
[22:20:00] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: I mean, sure, but as a narrative I think they were unnecessary
[22:20:16] <TsundereNoises> Urchin[emacs]: the ending of Dune worked better in isolation IMO
[22:21:07] <TsundereNoises> it's a pretty tight stand-alone story
[22:21:41] * Urchin[emacs] shrugs
[22:21:41] <TsundereNoises> Maybe I'll just rewatch Lawrence of Arabia when Dune comes out
[22:21:58] <Vohveli> speaking of adaptations that suck, I waited for an Artemis Fowl movie for like 20 years, then ultimately didn't even go see it
[22:22:08] <Vohveli> now there are just no movies at all that I'm looking forward to
[22:22:15] <TsundereNoises> from what I've heard that was the right decision
[22:22:21] <TsundereNoises> but I didn't see it either
[22:22:52] <TsundereNoises> honestly all the movies that end up being my favorites in any given year are usually movies I didn't know anything about before I saw them
[22:24:24] <TsundereNoises> Yeah, I can only think of 3 exceptions
[22:25:25] <marblesurf> yall were talking about dune?
[22:25:31] <marblesurf> i'm halfway through the first book
[22:25:52] <TsundereNoises> okay so we should be extra careful of Dune spoilers then
[22:26:28] <marblesurf> hehe thanks
[22:26:35] <marblesurf> it's cool, strangely islamic
[22:27:30] <TsundereNoises> I really like stories that vary the cultural background they're based on
[22:27:45] <TsundereNoises> right now I'm reading The Poppy War (China-inspired fantasy novel)
[22:27:59] <TsundereNoises> been meaning to read it for a few years, now all 3 books are out, finally got around to it
[22:28:55] <TsundereNoises> I'm about halfway through and it's pretty good so far, although there's still plenty of time for the author to fuck things up

[23:26:45] <Nanobot> I hate "easy" recipes that list a dozen different ingredients, half of them "chopped".
[23:30:27] * theholyduck chops Nanobot's onions
[23:31:03] <TsundereNoises> prep time: 5 minutes as long as you've spent 30 minutes doing prep before starting
[23:31:20] <DaPinkOne> Nanobot, they always do that shit on "30 minute" recipes. The prep takes 30~ minutes, not including the chopping, then it takes a full hour+ for the baking
[23:32:26] <DaPinkOne> it's not even disingenuous at this rate, it's just outright lies
[23:32:40] <theholyduck> DaPinkOne: i mean once you are good at it the chopping part doesnt take that much time
[23:32:52] <TsundereNoises> caramelize the onions (5 minutes)
[23:33:12] <DaPinkOne> theholyduck, it's true chopping gets faster with experience, but it does still take time
[23:33:15] <TsundereNoises> yes but recipes are full of absurd time estimates
[23:33:53] <Nanobot> Like, I was looking for a simple chili recipe that's just a step above "buy a can of chili, pour it into a bowl, and throw it in the microwave". Something like, "brown some ground beef so you aren't using nasty canned beef, and then dump a can of stuff into it"
[23:33:53] <TsundereNoises> it's so rare for anyone to actually both try them out, and honestly report the correct times
[23:34:24] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: cook the ground beef with a chopped onion
[23:34:40] <TsundereNoises> things like chili are nice because you don't really have to give a shit about chopping the onion that fine, you just cook it down
[23:34:49] <TsundereNoises> make it relatively small pieces and you're fine

[23:42:05] <Nanobot> DaPinkOne: I decided to skip the chili.
[23:42:23] <DaPinkOne> I was about to say chilli is easy, but then I remembered, I haven't made it since i lived with my parents
