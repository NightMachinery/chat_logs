[00:21:29] <on3pk> Hello.  I'm not sure how to describe the question to put it into Google.  I'm trying to find the "closest" row in a table to a value. I.e., I have a table of soft drinks. 0.2mL, 0.5mL, 2L, etc...  If someone was searching for a 1L drink, the 0.5mL drink would be the closest.  (SQLite3)
[00:26:38] *** Joins: epolanski (uid312403@id-312403.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[00:27:23] <on3pk> err. 0.2L, 0.5L, 2L
[00:32:11] <on3pk> I could do a select abs() as d order by d; but I'm worried how fast that would be on a table with 3000000 rows instead of just 3

[00:42:36] <Gizmokid2005> on3pk: you could use windowed functions and partitioning.
[00:42:49] <Gizmokid2005> I can't recall offhand what the support is like in sqlite for them.
[00:44:03] <on3pk> what is a windowed function?

[01:25:33] <Gizmokid2005> You can rank things by a given order, and use that order to determine what's the "next closest" row based upon groups (partitioning)
[01:25:57] <Gizmokid2005> It all depends on your actual needs and requirements, they're fairly vague so the answers are going to be the same.

[02:02:57] <on3pk> I guess I'm not sure how else to describe it.  If I have a table of a different size beverages, and someone wants a size not in the table, I'd want to get the closest available size
[02:04:05] <BSaboia> Gizmokid2005, is this also inefficient? https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_11&fiddle=d13a46b23685e22efd5cc10f99d1104a
[02:05:36] <Xgc> on3pk: If this is just a query for one specific value, your approach is fine.  ORDER BY ABS(x - y)
[02:06:37] <Gizmokid2005> BSaboia: yes, because you're *still* doing a sub-query inside your select statement. You need to stop that if you even remotely care about performance.
[02:06:43] <on3pk> Xgc, pretend I have a table of 3 million different drink sizes (I don't, but we're pretending) without a way to partition the table.  Is there a more efficient way of searching?
[02:06:58] <Gizmokid2005> There's absolutely *no* reason to do that given the example I provided you earlier. None. My example *100%* does that for you.
[02:08:00] <on3pk> ... I'm realizing that if we're pretending about things, we can pretend a lot of different things.  Like breaking into different tables for big drinks or small drinks or something like that.
[02:08:11] <BSaboia> Gizmokid2005, good. Thanks. There was a small thing in your example that made it wrong, but I understood its logic. I did this and now it's working: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_11&fiddle=4c1960f063b3c5587df5a90cbd809e95
[02:09:08] <Gizmokid2005> BSaboia: if I'm understanding you correctly, your example here is very wrong as well, but they're your requirements.
[02:09:10] <BSaboia> It would be actually this: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_11&fiddle=a514bf3f1cfb3489a803739792ac2015
[02:09:36] <BSaboia> Gizmokid2005, which example?
[02:09:40] *** Quits: vnf (~vnf@46.159.151.228) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:10:37] <Gizmokid2005> Is your requirement that for *every* record for other_table_id - if the values in *all* of the 'foo' records are 0, to instead to use that record's 'bar' value?
[02:11:04] <BSaboia> Yes
[02:11:18] <Gizmokid2005> Then how is your recordset here correct? shouldn't id=1 have bar's value in foobar?
[02:13:36] <BSaboia> Gizmokid2005, it's because I pasted the wrong link, sorry: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_11&fiddle=6df8383732c118767d96975d766b7ca4
[02:14:33] <Gizmokid2005> That looks a lot more like what you said you were expecting from this.
[02:15:07] <BSaboia> Gizmokid2005, yes, this is what I am expecting. Sorry, I just had a few different tabs with this rolling and pasted the wrong one

[02:55:05] <Gizmokid2005> BSaboia: yes. *anything* using a subquery in the select clause is worse.
[02:55:08] <Gizmokid2005> Do. Not. Do. It.
[02:55:12] <BSaboia> Nice. Thanks
[02:55:16] <Gizmokid2005> I don't know how else I can say that.
[02:55:42] <BSaboia> I understand it now. I just want to understand why. But I think that using EXPLAIN will help
[02:56:01] <Gizmokid2005> A CTE isn't helpful for what you need here, and if the table is as large as you say it is, the performance hit to storing this in temp while it runs isn't going to be helpful to your use case.
