[02:14:38] <lantech19446> just a scrollbar with arrows at the top and bottom and maybe a quarter inch wide so it's easier to use for scrolling with a touchpad
[02:14:40] <grawity> a wider one? one with up/down buttons? one that doesn't autohide?
[02:14:59] <grawity> I don't think gtk3 has buttons anymore, no
[02:15:00] <lantech19446> I don't really mind if it autohides but the other two are necessities

[02:46:22] <NoobAlice> lantech19446: If grawity's suggestion doesn't work, try https://old.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/n6ir5j/add_scrollbar_buttons_to_firefox_gtk3_on_gnulinux/ .  /r/FirefoxCSS very likely has the answer you want somewhere.
[02:46:23] <phrik> Title: Add scrollbar buttons to Firefox (GTK3, on GNU/Linux)? : FirefoxCSS (at old.reddit.com)
[02:47:17] <Exa> Foxboron: I'd open tcpdump
[02:47:43] <Foxboron> Exa: that's above my paygrade!
[02:47:50] <lantech19446> ok thanks NoobAlice and wow I didn't realize A how many people want those buttons and B that there's a subreddit for firefoxcss

[02:49:07] <NoobAlice> Haha, yeah.  That is JUST for making Firefox and the webpages it displays look like what you want.  People do things like move tabs to the bottom of FF, make the window transparent, add new buttons...all sorts of stuff.  It's a great subreddit.

[06:44:45] <ChromaCat248> are there any downsides to setting it to 4 billion so everything downloads at once
[06:44:47] <distek> nvm just found it
[06:45:52] <ChromaCat248> actually i assume they used an unsigned int since they don't expect anyone to set it higher than ~20

[17:06:59] <ringo_> Would someone be kind to briefly ELI5 on why 32bit libs/apps won't work on aarch64. I'm asking because the popular consumer-grade distros (say debian x86-64 or windows) allow you to run old 32bit apps on 64bit systems. Is that some giant overhead for those OS to maintain such backwards compatibility which aarch64 doesn't want to maintain? I understand that it's highly undesirable to use aarch64 distros
[17:07:01] <ringo_> because you risk not being able to build/install plenty of stuff?

[21:25:11] <cyphertite> Tor users - I have been seeing `systemctl status tor` messages (similar to these) quite frequently of late:  Guard ElNinoRelay ($2C74829C382C1363812FC2BF053122A9DCF6583B) is failing an extremely large amount of circuits.  This could indicate a route manipulation attack, extreme network overloaad, or a bug. Success counts are 5/259. Use counts are 0/0. 255 circuits completed, 0 were unusable, 251

For 4 nights in a row, Tucker has been claiming he has incontrovertible proof (and discussing the evidence) that the NSA has been reading his personal eMails (as a private US citizen).  The NSA, ofc, dismisses his allegations out of hand, but refuses to be interviewed on camera:  'We don't spy on Americans' ;p
