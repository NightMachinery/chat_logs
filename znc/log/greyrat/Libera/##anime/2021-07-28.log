[05:12:20] <ButterNoodle> and I dont get intimidated by management
[05:13:06] <MootPoot> hmm
[05:13:13] <MootPoot> sounds like advantages of having a good resume
[05:13:50] <ButterNoodle> yea, u dont know how many time I just left monster or whatever job site pulled up on my monitor in plain view of my manager
[05:14:18] <MootPoot> lol
[05:14:19] <MootPoot> power move
[05:14:30] <ButterNoodle> generally if they pissed me off...
[05:15:29] <MootPoot> yeah
[05:15:30] <ButterNoodle> damn
[05:15:34] <MootPoot> I dont think they hate me or anything here
[05:15:38] <ButterNoodle> my old boss owes me sushi
[05:15:41] <MootPoot> but I'm also only 25% price for them
[05:15:51] <MootPoot> which is probably the main reason why they're keeping me
[05:16:05] <ButterNoodle> he bet me I wouldn't have another job within 30 days
[05:16:24] <MootPoot> shit
[05:16:26] <ButterNoodle> I was tired of middle managements shit
[05:16:30] <ButterNoodle> and stuck

[05:21:51] <MootPoot> got my perofmrance review back
[05:21:59] <snake> MootPoot, why do you make suggestions that backfire?
[05:22:01] <MootPoot> told me that I skip meetings and am late regularly
[05:22:41] <MootPoot> snake:  I dont know exactly
[05:22:47] <MootPoot> but now I just dont make any suggestions
[05:22:53] <snake> MootPoot, right, that's what you need to do
[05:23:02] <snake> stop making the suggestions until you are more learnt and practicet
[05:23:42] <snake> MootPoot, at my job i did some things poorly though
[05:23:44] <snake> it happens
[05:24:05] <snake> just don't doubt yourself, let it make you stronger
[05:24:09] <snake> learn from it
[05:24:23] <MootPoot> well it was weird stuff like
[05:24:51] <MootPoot> I have to submit paperwork on X day, I submit it midday, boss says your format is wrong, and update it again and resend it to me
[05:25:02] <MootPoot> I do so within an hour tops
[05:25:16] <MootPoot> next week monday rolls around he asks me where my paperwork is
[05:25:23] <MootPoot> I told him I sent it to him right after
[05:25:37] <MootPoot> he says okay, sends it to other manager, who okays it.
[05:25:59] <MootPoot> then they both drop me a line like "this is a lesson for the future, submit your paperwork on time"
[05:26:09] <MootPoot> wym bitch its you who missed it
[05:26:25] * sentionics received a medicated plug for extracted wisdom tooth site this morning. Apparently swallowed that plug somehow during after-lunch nap today.
[05:26:26] <MootPoot> I submitted it on time ( fixed, on the right day , within work hours )
[05:26:30] <snake> huh
[05:26:34] <snake> sounds dysfunctional
[05:27:05] <snake> sometimes you can use a strategy for that scenario, where you have everyone in the same room/place at the same time, and explain what happened
[05:27:21] <snake> but it might not work, and you might not know everyone that is involved
[05:27:35] <snake> but like, you could tell the end guy that the middle guy is the one who was late
[05:27:46] <snake> you gave it to him before, and he might believe you or he might not
[05:28:14] <snake> did you personally hand it to the middle guy?
[05:28:18] <MootPoot> no
[05:28:32] <snake> yeah he didn't notice it and threw you under the bus
[05:28:33] <MootPoot> I dont talk to the middle guy, hes in another dept
[05:28:50] <MootPoot> I explicitly told my boss that I sent it to him on time
[05:28:55] <MootPoot> not that its a big issue
[05:29:12] <snake> yeah
[05:29:35] <snake> i feel like you could always have some experience like that to talk about online for hours and become neurotic over
[05:29:42] <snake> you need to disconnect from them emotionally
[05:29:58] <snake> get your things done what you are responsible for, but otherwise, try not to care about them
[05:30:03] <snake> they are just your internship for school
[05:30:07] <snake> treat them that way in your mind
[05:30:38] <snake> when you aren't at work, don't worry about work, shut it off
[05:30:39] <MootPoot> yeah I've already kind of mentally disconnected from this company
[05:30:46] <snake> watch the helpful fox senko san
[05:30:51] <MootPoot> In the start I was a little hopeful and shit
[05:31:15] <snake> i know you're into fucking cabbages, hobbies are great tho i recommend maybe finding a more normal one.
[05:31:32] <MootPoot> but now from a more (maybe jaded, maybe realistic) POV all I see is a company trying to get experienced programmed skill out of a intern, that they only hired cuz he's 70% off
[05:31:42] <MootPoot> I doubt they are going to offer me a continuing contract
[05:31:47] <MootPoot> after internship is over
[05:31:58] <snake> that's fine, you don't want to work there anyways i suspect
[05:32:16] <MootPoot> the only upside is just remote only and 4 days a week work
[05:32:17] <MootPoot> thats it
[05:32:24] <MootPoot> I still work 40h a week
[05:32:32] <MootPoot> pay is garbage too
[05:32:32] <snake> nice
[05:32:57] <snake> MootPoot, we can tell you how bad your job is, but you already know it
[05:33:43] <snake> just know it is temporary, hang in there, you got this
[05:34:45] <snake> MootPoot, will you do Advent of Code 2021?
[05:35:00] <snake> i'm hoping to do it but i also will probably have final exams around that time
[05:35:14] <snake> you can do it at work
[05:35:27] <MootPoot> what/when/where is it

[05:36:01] <snake> i made it i think 10 days
[05:36:06] <Jigsy> Huh.
[05:36:06] <snake> for 2020, before i was just burnt out
[05:36:09] <Jigsy> Slipknot died.
[05:36:46] <snake> yeah i completed 10 days, day 11 was where i threw in the towel
[05:37:21] <MootPoot> company management likes to talk a lot about when we're gonna make it big
[05:37:38] <MootPoot> but its not like I'm going to get a slice of that pie
[05:37:41] <MootPoot> so what do I care
[05:37:54] <snake> yup
[05:38:02] <snake> well they want you to quit
[05:38:05] <snake> they're players
[05:38:14] <snake> and they're fucking with you to make you want to quit, don't do it
[05:38:14] <Jigsy> [02:07:38] <MootPoot> but its not like I'm going to get a slice of that pie <--- Get a load of this guy.
[05:38:42] <MootPoot> yeah I'm not gonna quit
[05:38:46] <MootPoot> its not "terrible"
[05:38:50] <MootPoot> but its far from ideal imo
[05:38:57] <Jigsy> Why not do what Wally does?
[05:39:00] <Jigsy> Do nothing all day.
[05:39:07] <Jigsy> Get paid for literally doing no work.
[05:39:10] <snake> my boss used to say "I wouldn't want you to miss the big ones" and similar
[05:39:16] <Jigsy> Turn up, slack off...
[05:39:17] <snake> when i was asking for parttime
[05:39:19] <Arcorann> I do Advent of Code each year. There was a set of IRC channels for it on freenode last year, presumably they've moved here this year
[05:39:47] <snake> so to play me, they knew i knew they were taking advantage of me, so they promised more later, very positive vibes
[05:39:56] <snake> when they rehired me, it was more what you are dealing with
[05:40:04] <snake> because they wanted me to do some work and then quit later
[05:40:10] <snake> and they were paying me decently
[05:40:27] <MootPoot> wanna know how much I make?
[05:40:30] <snake> sure
[05:40:44] <MootPoot> I make about 20-21 cad an hour
[05:40:49] <MootPoot> !c 21 cad to usd
[05:40:50] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: I don't know.
[05:40:56] <MootPoot> !g 21 cad to usd
[05:40:57] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: Convert 21 Canadian Dollar to US Dollar - CAD to USD ... - Xe <https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=21&From=CAD&To=USD> | 21 Canadian Dollar to US Dollar, convert 21 CAD in USD <https://cad.currencyrate.today/usd/21> | 21 CAD to USD | 21 Canadian Dollar to US Dollar ... - Myfin.Us <https://myfin.us/currency-converter/cad-usd/21>
[05:40:59] <Jigsy> Wow, that's like 200 USD.
[05:41:14] <MootPoot> 16.5 usd roundabouts
[05:41:27] <snake> yeah that was where i quit the first time
[05:41:30] <MootPoot> here's the kicker, the company only pays me about 25% of that 
[05:41:35] <MootPoot> from their pocket
[05:41:36] <MootPoot> rest is govt
[05:41:42] <MootPoot> since I'm an intern
[05:41:59] <snake> then after they rehired i managed to get about $20, then up to $24 then about $26
[05:42:14] <snake> then they fired me, because i would not let their abuse hurt me
[05:42:36] <MootPoot> my coworkers are pretty nice tho
[05:42:37] <snake> MootPoot, ah
[05:42:38] <MootPoot> I like em
[05:42:44] <snake> ah
[05:42:45] <MootPoot> good peeps
[05:43:05] <snake> my coworkers seemed nice, but eventually a few of them were kind of in-on-it
[05:43:12] <snake> to make me want to quit
[05:43:37] <snake> the guy i liked the most was actually the boss's son
[05:43:40] <snake> he was pretty chill
[05:43:49] <snake> and cool
[05:43:53] <snake> IT guy
[05:44:34] <MootPoot> only real hope is that they might make me shift depts after I'm done with my current project
[05:44:38] <snake> MootPoot, did i tell you about the time, i went on a kayaking trip with the ceo (not the boss), and then they tried to scare me by leaving rifle ammo casings by our car
[05:44:38] <MootPoot> under somebody else
[05:44:58] <MootPoot> wat
[05:45:15] <snake> it was not a legal place to shoot, so someone had to have just dumped them there
[05:45:33] <snake> it was too close to a road and not a hunting area
[05:45:46] <MootPoot> tbh even hunters pick up their casings
[05:45:50] <snake> yup
[05:46:19] <snake> also my boss killed a guy when he was 14
[05:46:27] <snake> so i think intimidation is a pattern in his behavior
[05:46:37] <snake> and mind games / manipulation
[05:46:51] <snake> well.. i don';t KNOW that, but someone with the same name did
[05:47:00] <snake> and the dates almsot match up to what i thought his age was
[05:47:45] <snake> MootPoot, he said he didnt know the gun was loaded and was just trying to intimidate his friend
[05:48:12] <snake> well the one in the case report, again not 100% certain it was my boss
[05:49:18] <snake> MootPoot, fortunately before they had no more use for me and fired me, it "clicked" and i started to program 10x better than i ever did
[05:49:31] <MootPoot> well, shit
[05:49:32] <snake> just do your job and make sure to get R&R too

[06:16:44] <amigojapan> Also. I have only slpt about 5 hours today..

[06:20:47] <amigojapan> I don't get putting people down cause they have had many sexual relationships
[06:21:03] <MootPoot> hmm
[06:21:08] <amigojapan> Or raising them in the car of men
[06:21:14] <MootPoot> depends on how you look at it tbh
[06:21:16] <MootPoot> imo I guess
[06:21:18] <amigojapan> Case not car
[06:21:40] <MootPoot> looking at them as second class humans dosen't really make any sense to me eith er
[06:21:43] <MootPoot> either*
[06:22:01] <amigojapan> Right
[06:22:01] <MootPoot> but that being said, if I was dating, I would have a bias against people who have had many relationships before
[06:22:24] <MootPoot> since if I wanted to get into a relationship, it would be to get a long term and stable relationship
[06:22:46] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but society make us think that guys who had many relationships are cooler
[06:22:59] <amigojapan> Seems sexist to me

[06:23:12] <MootPoot> and since patterns and habits are pretty much set in humans, you can use t hem to decently predict future behaviour
[06:23:53] <MootPoot> I'd rather date a person with only 1  bf before, rather then a 2 time divorcee or a girl who goes around having weekly relationships with everyone
[06:24:03] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah. I guess you are right in that. I like commitment to one partoner
[06:24:26] <MootPoot> the chance of divorce goes up the more divorces that person has had before
[06:24:33] <MootPoot> I dont see how dating is any different
[06:24:35] <mikau> It does take a leap of faith. I'd rather have someone more experienced, though.

[06:26:46] <amigojapan> mikau: in this case I think I agree with MootPoot 
[06:27:38] <amigojapan> mikau: several relations makes it more possible that this relation is just one of many
[06:28:04] <mikau> I think the important thing is to look for someone with the will to commit.

[14:23:48] <KatrinValerie> I still think it's in poor taste, because friends family etc already have to deal with a heartbreaking loss through a very studid preventable reason, making fun of the dead person might be hard on those left behind.

[14:26:29] <Berlin36> :(
[14:26:46] <il> KatrinValerie, and I'm just expressing my opinion on the matter, the matter being your opinion. I think people are going to keep having your opinion even though it's a waste of time and effort.

[14:50:45] <il> Berlin36, scrot
[14:50:56] <il> use scrot

[14:54:45] <il> You can even write a script to do it fer you
[14:54:47] <death916> and use the discord link
[14:54:48] <Berlin36> but how to get it copied to my clipboard
[14:54:59] <il> Berlin36, select it, you get it into primary selection
[14:55:03] <il> paste it with middle click
[14:55:31] <Berlin36> it..it doesn't get copied to the clipboard
[14:55:57] <il> primary selection
[14:56:03] <Berlin36> oOooOH it gets saved to a folder
[14:56:07] <il> what
[14:56:13] <il> oh you're still struggling with the screenshot lol
[14:56:25] <il> I thought you were asking about the link
[14:56:33] <Berlin36> i want it to be copied to clipboard, not saving to a foldwr
[14:56:44] <il> i'm trying to teach you, lad
[14:57:00] <il> But you want to go on with your wicked ways of compressing your screenshots and using browsers to upload it
[14:57:26] <Berlin36> k wait a sec
[14:57:29] <il> You know, unix philosophy
[14:57:31] <Berlin36> gonna try get the link
[14:57:34] <il> each tool does one thing well
[14:57:46] <il> you can write a script which screenshots and automatically uploads with curl
[14:57:50] <il> I can write it for you

[15:00:26] <il> congrats!
[15:00:28] <Berlin36> isn't it the same as pasting it into a site?
[15:00:30] <il> compare those two screenshots
[15:00:45] <Berlin36> oh yeah
[15:00:51] <il> the original one is 'grainy'
[15:00:53] <il> because of compression
[15:00:58] <il> server side compression
[15:01:00] <il> I'm guessing
[15:01:05] <il> or your screenshot tool
[15:01:10] <il> either way, I solved your problems haha
[15:01:13] <Berlin36> xd
[15:01:44] <il> Now do you want to automate the screenshot and upload?
[15:01:46] <Berlin36> but what if i don't wanna paste my screenshots anywhere in the internet
[15:01:59] <il> Berlin36, then just use scrot
[15:02:13] <Berlin36> it gets saved in my home directory
[15:02:13] <il> and why are you taking screenshots if you don't want to share 'em?
[15:02:22] <il> Berlin36, delete em
[15:02:33] <il> do scrot ; rm *scrot*
[15:02:36] <Berlin36> well maybe directly into a chat, why would i send them through a link into a chat 
[15:02:42] <il> that'd take a screenshot and remove the file immediately
[15:02:50] <Berlin36> (a chat like telegram where i can send pics directly)
[15:02:52] <il> Berlin36, because you can't send them any other way into irc
[15:03:13] <il> Well, if you're using telegram, just upload the file and delete it
[15:03:17] <Berlin36> im gonna write something for automatization
[15:03:26] <il> I don't think you can automate sending to telegram
[15:03:29] <Berlin36> can i give the file a name?
[15:03:36] <il> Berlin36, let me teach you another trick
[15:03:40] <il> man scrot
[15:03:40] <Berlin36> no, not for telegram, for getting a link and deleting the file
[15:03:47] <il> Oh,i can do that for you
[15:04:49] <Berlin36> okay im almost done

[15:13:20] <il> Berlin36, LFS, for the past 10 years
[15:13:27] <il> just kidding, I use kubuntu without KDE
[15:13:29] <mixfix41> you probs sitting at microsoft offices now for all i know
[15:13:45] <il> mixfix41, ms offices as in their headquarters?
[15:13:48] <il> I'll take that as a compliment
[15:13:52] <Berlin36> kubuntu.. without kde
[15:13:57] <il> Berlin36, yeah, it annoyed me
[15:13:59] <mixfix41> yup
[15:14:04] <il> I use cwm
[15:14:04] <Berlin36> it's like using xubuntu without xfce
[15:14:09] <klaxa> sounds like ubuntu but with extra steps
[15:14:11] <il> Berlin36, yeah, DE doesn't matter
[15:14:15] <il> klaxa, basically
[15:14:21] <il> klaxa, without cannonical
[15:14:28] <klaxa> ah good point
[15:14:32] <Berlin36> i like arch, very convenient package manager
[15:14:34] <klaxa> that shit sucks cancer
[15:14:45] <il> Yeah, if I was to use a new distro, I don't know what I'd use
[15:14:48] <klaxa> not that i use ubantoo anyway
[15:14:49] <mixfix41> maybe try slimming the logs ? id like to see less fight picking esp
[15:14:52] <il> I mean, I can have the same setup on any distro, I don't use any weird tools
[15:15:06] <il> mixfix41, slimming the logs?
[15:15:11] <mixfix41> yup
[15:15:17] <il> I'm not familiar with the idiom
[15:15:22] <il> chat less?
[15:15:25] <Berlin36> i love i3, it is so light and easy to use
[15:15:39] <mixfix41> you dont understand the message its pointless to chat with you
[15:15:39] <il> Berlin36, I used it 2014 to 2016 or 2017
[15:15:46] <il> mixfix41, makes sense
[15:15:55] <Berlin36> i used it for about 2 weeks
[15:16:03] <il> Berlin36, another pro tip
[15:16:05] <il> start using tmux
[15:16:06] <mixfix41> as in also asking questions goes kinda the same even w/ positive attitudes
[15:16:07] <il> and read up on it
[15:16:13] <Berlin36> i heard about tmux
[15:16:23] <il> yeah, definitely should learn it, I should've started using it earlier
[15:16:32] <il> You're gonna be way ahead of me if you listen to me
[15:16:37] <il> listen to me, novice
[15:16:39] <il> !
[15:16:45] <Berlin36> why should i use tmux
[15:16:52] <Berlin36> it's a terminal or what
[15:16:57] <il> Berlin36, because it's convenient and it's going to help you with managing servers later on
[15:17:04] <il> It's a terminal multiplexer, first line of manpages
[15:17:11] <il> Berlin36, do you know how to use apropos?
[15:17:27] <il> another thing to learn
[15:18:32] <il> But yeah, I suggest you learn how to use tmux, get comfy with editing text files from CLI (which you probably or hopefully already are), and then get a vps, learn how to deal with SSH keys, then start learning docker
[15:18:46] <il> And if you do that, you can get a job
[15:18:49] <Berlin36> yeah i edit with vim
[15:19:00] <il> congrats, you're on the right side of history
[15:19:03] <il> jk nothing wrong with emacs, lisp good
[15:19:09] <Berlin36> if i learn some programming, i do that with sublime text
[15:19:17] <il> No
[15:19:31] <il> programing with vim, customize vim to work for everything you do
[15:19:43] <Berlin36> yeah i saw you can do a lot with vim
[15:19:47] <il> Yep
[15:20:04] <il> I can give you a list of add-ons I use some other time, I'm feeling too hyperactive to do it rn
[15:20:25] <Berlin36> why tmux, i mean you can open more terminals
[15:20:46] <il> Berlin36, because you don't need a tiling wm when you use tmux and you can also use tmux on remote servers
[15:20:47] <Berlin36> il: okay, ill take a look
[15:20:52] <Berlin36> oh
[15:20:53] <il> for example, this irc session
[15:20:57] <il> is in a tmux session on a vps 
[15:21:05] <il> I connect to the vps and then to the tmux session, and I'm here
[15:21:06] <PancakeMatsuri_> tmux can auto-save your sessions and auto-load on reboo
[15:21:08] <il> and it looks like I have a bouncer
[15:21:10] <PancakeMatsuri_> *reboot
[15:21:12] <il> but I don't
[15:21:15] <il> it's much simpler
[15:21:44] <il> Other than that, it's very keyboard centric and makes it easy to do a few things at once
[15:22:06] <il> tmux is basically your 'window manager' for your terminals
[15:22:11] <il> but neater
[15:22:21] <Berlin36> oh shiii- i split the terminal
[15:22:24] <Berlin36> so weird tho
[15:22:29] <Berlin36> ctrl B and then %
[15:22:43] <death916> i love tmux
[15:22:45] <death916> handy on my server
[15:22:47] <death916> and for wsl
[15:22:48] <il> Berlin36, yeah, you can change your perfix
[15:22:56] <il> I use ctrl + a on my local tmux session
[15:23:00] <il> and I leave it as default on remote ones
[15:23:10] <death916> i jus leave it default cuz when i go to a new machine it wont b my custom
[15:23:16] <Berlin36> wow pretty cool
[15:23:16] <death916> and ill be all mixed up
[15:23:21] <Berlin36> yeah
[15:23:30] <il> death916, it's not bad, actually
[15:23:40] <il> Berlin36, and you can detach from the session with prefix + d
[15:23:44] <il> and then attach again
[15:23:46] <il> you do tmux ls
[15:23:53] <il> get a list of session and then tmux a -t 'nameofsession'
[15:24:13] <il> but you can read manpages for that
[15:24:20] <PancakeMatsuri_> I use a plugin that's got a UI for session switching
[15:24:33] <Berlin36> omg its so cool
[15:24:45] <Berlin36> it like using i3 but in i3 in a terminal
[15:25:04] <il> PancakeMatsuri_, you can probably write a dmenu script for that
[15:25:06] <il> I'd guess
[15:25:09] <Berlin36> i can make even multiple kind of workspaces
[15:25:11] <il> I mean... yeah, I could probably do that
[15:25:16] <il> Berlin36, yes
[15:25:20] <Berlin36> ctrl b and C
[15:25:32] <il> you can write a script which opens and sets up a session to your liking
[15:25:33] <il> I have one of those
[15:26:07] <Berlin36> sounds cool

[16:21:31] <Berlin36> you can do a lot of stuff there, i saw people host sites and setup their own clouds 
[16:21:41] <Berlin36> like a vps 
[16:22:32] <theholyduck> for what? :P
[16:22:46] <theholyduck> its somewhat usable for hosting random stuff 
[16:22:57] <Berlin36> yeah
[16:23:05] <il> Sure, but you'd have to be willing to host on your home lan
[16:23:19] <il> which is less safe than just getting a vps, also probably higher latency
[16:23:23] <il> and lower reliability
[16:23:34] <theholyduck> i mean somewhat i guess :P 
[16:23:42] <Berlin36> can you also buy a vps? like for a lifetime
[16:23:46] <il> No
[16:23:56] <theholyduck> il: but like 2005 era duck would have loved something like that
[16:24:07] <theholyduck> i had to leave a old laptop at home to bypass firewalls on the school network
[16:24:08] <HeTo> safety depends on what your risks are
[16:24:14] <theholyduck> when i lived in a 2005 era dorm
[16:24:19] <il> theholyduck, that's cool
[16:24:24] <il> you used your laptop as a proxy?
[16:24:32] <HeTo> with VPS you risk someone else running on the same host getting your private data through Spectre
[16:24:33] <theholyduck> i used an old laptop as a ssh running on port 443
[16:24:40] <theholyduck> and used ssh as a proxy
[16:24:42] <theholyduck> over 443
[16:24:48] <theholyduck> because 443 generally goes through most firewalls
[16:24:48] <Berlin36> what
[16:24:49] <HeTo> or just plain old VM vulnerability
[16:25:03] <HeTo> as well as having to trust the host
[16:25:07] <il> HeTo, yeah, so you don't have your porn on your vps
[16:25:13] <theholyduck> il: its not like 15 year old duck could rent a VPS
[16:25:25] <theholyduck> and in 2005 the cheap online VPS thing wasnt really a thing
[16:25:35] <il> VPS might not have been a thing at all in 2005
[16:25:42] <il> virtualization picked up relatively recently
[16:25:45] <theholyduck> i mean. they existed :P 
[16:25:49] <theholyduck> or something like them anyway 
[16:25:56] <theholyduck> even in 2005 people ran seedboxes
[16:25:58] <theholyduck> for torrenting
[16:26:10] <il> were seedboxes virtualizes?
[16:26:11] <theholyduck> it just wasnt cheap or convenient
[16:26:13] <il> virtualized*
[16:27:08] <theholyduck> il:  i mean if nothing else you could generally get access to a unix shell atleast 
[16:27:28] <theholyduck> that level of "virtualization" existed forever
[16:27:46] <il> theholyduck, still can
[16:27:54] <theholyduck> i mean sure
[16:27:55] <JesseDesu> i dont understand technology

[21:37:07] <JesseDesu> maybe they were siblings
[21:37:14] <ButterNoodle> or daughter
[21:37:29] <MootPoot> can we make attgatt mandatory
[21:37:34] <MootPoot> so my insruance goes down
[21:37:39] <ButterNoodle> that wont help
[21:37:41] <MootPoot> cuz of all the tards my age group
[21:37:52] <MootPoot> buying  600cc+ supersports and squidding
[21:38:14] <JesseDesu> 600cc is where its at
[21:38:18] <ButterNoodle> better to let them die from BFT than let them live for 30 years in a pvs
[21:38:25] * MootPoot would buy a honda 125 and be happy with it if he could get it for 1500 or so new
[21:38:34] <JesseDesu> no
[21:38:38] <JesseDesu> u want 600+
[21:38:43] <MootPoot> meh
[21:38:51] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: not for a first bike.. ever
[21:38:53] <JesseDesu> but learn on 200
[21:39:00] <JesseDesu> 250
[21:39:02] <MootPoot> I highly doubt I'll be able to outride a 300 for 2 years at least
[21:39:12] <JesseDesu> nah you'll get used to it quick
[21:39:14] <MootPoot> and actually bring a 600 to its limits? also doubt it
[21:39:15] <JesseDesu> maybe 6 months
[21:39:28] <ButterNoodle> a 600 ss?
[21:39:31] <MootPoot> used to it is much different from getting every last drop from it
[21:39:34] <MootPoot> afaik
[21:39:37] <JesseDesu> depends
[21:39:45] <ButterNoodle> you cant ride one to its limits on the street and live very long tbh
[21:39:47] <JesseDesu> if you ride everyday, you'll get used to it quick
[21:39:47] <MootPoot> you can lug around on a busa at 30mph all day and be fine
[21:40:00] <ButterNoodle> with an extended swingarm
[21:40:04] <MootPoot> but its kinda pointless to do it
[21:40:06] <ButterNoodle> and one front rotor off
[21:40:06] <JesseDesu> with turbo
[21:40:12] <ButterNoodle> 2 turbos and nos
[21:40:15] <JesseDesu> supercharger
[21:40:35] <JesseDesu> dynamite
[21:40:37] <MootPoot> might do a 800-1000cc adv bike and a 600cc supersport
[21:40:39] <JesseDesu> like in back to the future 3
[21:40:49] <MootPoot> cant seem to find many close trails here open to bikes
[21:40:50] <ButterNoodle> I prefer naturally aspirated bikes.. less things break
[21:40:59] <MootPoot> I too like breathing normally
[21:41:06] <ButterNoodle> I want another sportbike tbh
[21:41:16] <JesseDesu> i learned about aspiration from playing granturismo 4
[21:41:24] <MootPoot> 1000cc adv = 600cc supersport
[21:41:26] <MootPoot> right?
[21:41:34] <MootPoot> since advs are detuned
[21:41:38] <ButterNoodle> may wait a year or two for some cbr1000rrrrrrrrs to show up on the used market
[21:41:45] <MootPoot> rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[21:41:46] <ButterNoodle> not de-tuned

[21:42:08] <ButterNoodle> inline twins vs v4 vs i4
[21:42:12] <ButterNoodle> and the power delivery
[21:42:26] <MootPoot> I want a 300cc i4

[22:23:12] <Nanobot> Day 4 of doing my 2021 taxes (or rather, creating spreadsheets to automate the process, for planning purposes and to make doing the actual taxes easier). I'm looking at Form 8960. Nearly every field says "(See instruction)". Whyyyyy
[22:23:53] <Nanobot> The instructions are a wall of text.
[22:27:04] <hassoon> dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooods
[22:28:25] <JesseDesu> butternoodle i'm mostly afraid of installing the cardo in the AGV helmet because i might put back the liner incorrectly and possibly be unable to figure it out
[22:45:21] <isekaijin> Nanobot: Complicated tax systems exist to oppress those who cannot hire an accountant. Clearly, the only solution is armed rebellion.
[22:46:14] <Nanobot> isekaijin: No, it isn't oppressive. Taxes are pretty simple unless you have lots of weird special cases or you're making over a million dollars.
[22:46:47] <Nanobot> Unfortunately, I'm making over a million dollars.
[22:47:02] <MootPoot> I mean
[22:47:25] <MootPoot> a 10% flat tax on everything combined with subsidies for the poor does sound like a easy solution
[22:48:52] <Nanobot> A flat tax would require dramatically raising taxes on the poor and middle class. Flat taxes make no sense unless you're rich and therefore would see your taxes lowered.
[22:49:10] <Nanobot> Rich people LOVE the idea of a flat tax.
[22:49:26] <MootPoot> the rich people already pay like 0% as it is
[22:49:36] <MootPoot> or, well
[22:49:39] <MootPoot> rich corporations
[22:49:43] <Nanobot> Only through loophole which they'd STILL be using if we had a flat tax.
[22:50:00] <Nanobot> A flat tax doesn't make the loopholes go away.
[22:50:16] <MootPoot> a flat tax would fix that though; no loopholes in something so straightforward
[22:50:28] <MootPoot> afaik
[22:50:36] <Nanobot> Huh? A flat tax does absolutely nothing to address loopholes.

[22:50:57] <MootPoot> to my knowledge loopholes exist due to the spider web of existing tax code
[22:51:10] <Nanobot> A flat tax just means that we switch from multiple tax brackets to one tax bracket.
[22:51:18] <MootPoot> which creates convoluted ways to get through with paying little/no tax
[22:51:31] <Nanobot> That has nothing to do with a flat tax
[22:51:35] <MootPoot> oh
[22:51:47] <MootPoot> I guess its more tax reform then?
[22:51:51] <MootPoot> rather then flat tax
[22:52:03] <Nanobot> What you're talking about is more a matter of how income is defined.
[22:54:59] <Nanobot> For example, if the income is made outside the U.S., is it taxed in the U.S.? What exactly does it mean for income to be made outside the U.S.? If there's a company that serves people in the U.S., but is legally structured as a foreign company, how are they handled from a tax perspective? It's that sort of thing that leads to the loopholes you're talking about.

[23:46:24] <Nanobot> If I were to move, it would be to somewhere cooler and cloudier. Something like the Oregon/Washington coast.
[23:46:47] <Nanobot> But I have no plans to move anytime soon. I'm not the kind of person who likes big changes.
[23:46:48] <MootPoot> better food, cheap services, cheaper benefits, cheaper and in some cases same quality healthcare, can raise your standard of living majorly for the same amount you are spending now, ( hire cook, cleaners etc )

[23:47:38] <MootPoot> tbh if it wasent for a certain few laws over there, I would have country hopped already ( provided I could get a remote job that allowed that )
[23:48:08] *** Joins: esmailelbob (~esmailelb@41.232.241.14)
[23:48:20] <MootPoot> walkable cities as well
[23:48:43] <MootPoot> *cough* cute asian girls
[23:49:26] <MootPoot> more relaxed culture in a lot of ways..I guess
[23:50:08] <MootPoot> but if you dont really give a shit about that stuff then yeah I guess you can stay put

[23:53:06] <Nanobot> The only motivation I can think of for moving would be for better weather (cooler temperatures and less dry weather). But even then, there would be downsides: my family would be further away, moving is a pain, and I'd have to adapt to a new environment. I want to retire so I can relax and just do whatever I want at the moment.
[23:53:21] <MootPoot> sure
[23:53:33] <MootPoot> as long as you're happy then it dosent really matter
[23:53:37] <MootPoot> just uh
[23:53:50] <MootPoot> dont end up spending all your retirement money on vtubers
[23:54:51] <Sxem> i cant beleive these email spammers expect me to click on 2vvkixr.j1h21kjamazon.com to resolve a problem with my amazon account. youd think they cd at the least come up with something less random looking
[23:55:24] <MootPoot> well, they're selecting for people
[23:55:38] <MootPoot> if you noticed that , then you're probably too sharp to scam anyway
[23:56:27] <Sxem> i dont understand how it keeps getting thru the spam blocker
