[03:23:25] <birkoff> I have a 'position: fixed' bar and the div after it overflows horizontally. on pc the bar would stay in place while allowing one to scroll the next div horizontally, but on android and I have tested several browser and devices so far , when scrolling horizontally the bar would stop filling 100% width of viewport and be scrolled like regular non fixed divs

[17:53:57] <Rockwood> oops
[17:54:11] <Rockwood> entuland, another issue in my script
[17:54:48] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-lygbv?file=/gym.css i wanna do input box and button in one line
[17:54:58] <entuland> Rockwood, just ask in a channel that fits without tagging anyone in particular, don't limit your chances at getting helped
[17:55:17] <Rockwood> ok
[17:57:13] <entuland> Rockwood, you could wrap the input and the button in a span, so that the flex parent will consider them as a whole and allocate only one "slot" for their span wrapper
[17:57:24] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-lygbv?file=/demo.js
[17:57:46] <entuland> if you don't want wrapping in any case there, you may want to make the inner boxes use grid instead of flex
[17:58:01] <Rockwood> oops ok
[17:58:30] <entuland> that way you can impose two columns (but you'll also need to make the first three elements to take 2 cells each)
[17:59:29] <Rockwood> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout like this
[17:59:43] <entuland> nomn, you don't really need to set any default unless you need to explicitly read such default (say, to retrieve the current value of an inline style declaration)
[18:00:07] <entuland> the problem is likely elsewhere - try and make a fiddle as suggested above or provide a link to the live page if accessible
[18:00:38] <entuland> Rockwood, using a grid there would give you better control likely
[18:00:50] <Rockwood> okay
[18:01:13] <Rockwood> i am starting fiddle for try
[18:02:30] <nomn> alright I will (I just can't for the next few hours)
[18:02:45] <entuland> no rush, nomn, feel free to post here when you'll have the fiddle ready
[18:03:38] <Rockwood> grid-row: 1 / 3; what is 1 and what is 3 here?
[18:04:10] <entuland> open the mozilla documentation and search for grid-row
[18:04:16] <Rockwood> okay
[18:04:41] <entuland> by the way, I slightly misread your fiddle - you only have one flex, that is flexing the four children, that is okay
[18:05:05] <Rockwood> gr8
[18:05:24] <entuland> you need to make each children use grid (I thought they were flexing their contents, they're not)
[18:06:03] <entuland> those four boxes are getting the elements stacked by the fact that they're LI inside of an UL
[18:06:36] <entuland> if you want to use a grid layout, there, you can keep the input and the button inside of separate LI elements
[18:07:09] <Rockwood> in this case i dont need many li
[18:07:12] <Rockwood> think
[18:07:17] <Rockwood> by grid
[18:07:26] <entuland> in theory you don't need the UL at all
[18:07:26] <Rockwood> i can control much nicer
[18:07:33] <Rockwood> yes
[18:08:02] <Rockwood> what about single div with many spans
[18:08:05] <Rockwood> ??
[18:08:08] <entuland> that's okay
[18:08:19] <entuland> using grid-template-areas you can define the organization of the various "parts" of that "card"
[18:08:28] <entuland> then you can simply assign each element to a specific area
[18:08:40] <entuland> that way, if you want to move stuff around, you just have to change the grid template
[18:09:29] <Rockwood> simply i copied code for testing
[18:09:32] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/8qm5waoc/
[18:10:16] <entuland> no, that's not easy to deal with
[18:10:25] <entuland> I'll show you a better approach with areas
[18:12:27] <Rockwood> oka
[18:14:53] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/pqwk0xr5/
[18:15:38] <entuland> you can name the grid areas as you like better, don't get mislead by the fact that I used header, input or anything else in the grid area names
[18:17:01] <entuland> also, don't blindly reproduce that structure - you're supposed to only have one non-hidden <main>
[18:17:16] <entuland> so don't use <main> if you're going to show multiple instances
[18:18:36] <Rockwood> main * stands for?
[18:18:43] <Rockwood> * <--
[18:18:54] <entuland> eh, that's a very important basic CSS information
[18:19:04] <entuland> open the introductory page for the selectors
[18:19:12] <entuland> and find that asterisk
[18:20:39] <Rockwood> means all?
[18:21:20] <entuland> means any element
[18:21:34] <Rockwood>  /* Selects all elements */
[18:21:36] <entuland> it's not exactly the same concept as "all"
[18:21:45] <entuland> yes, key point there being "elements"
[18:21:47] <Rockwood> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors
[18:22:08] <Rockwood> select all elements in main tag?
[18:22:14] <Rockwood> am right?
[18:22:21] <entuland> all elements that are descendants
[18:22:35] <entuland> the space there matters, it's not a child combinator
[18:23:19] <Rockwood> wow awesome
[18:23:22] <entuland> refresh this page: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/pqwk0xr5/
[18:23:41] <entuland> notice how I changed "main *" into "main > *"
[18:24:01] <entuland> that's important because I only want to style the children of that main wrapper
[18:24:02] <Rockwood> .main > * {
[18:24:05] <entuland> yep
[18:24:06] <Rockwood> yes
[18:24:29] <entuland> also notice how I oversimplified the area names
[18:24:29] <Rockwood> i got it your point now
[18:24:32] <entuland> good
[18:24:41] <entuland> you're free to use the area names you want, as explained above
[18:25:03] <Rockwood> yes i am trying to understand every thing
[18:25:07] <entuland> good
[18:26:00] <Rockwood> as you can see my sendbox
[18:26:32] <entuland> always better to just paste the link
[18:26:46] <Rockwood> before this i was fully dependent of material-ui
[18:26:49] <entuland> so that people don't have to hunt the link in the backscroll
[18:27:13] <Rockwood> but now i am feeling more comfortable in normal css stuff
[18:27:15] <entuland> oh wait, you were just talking about that, I thought you wanted us to revise your last version
[18:27:23] <Rockwood> 2 sec
[18:27:26] <Rockwood> showing
[18:27:28] <entuland> yep, getting to know the actual bits and pieces that do the stuff is better
[18:27:56] <Rockwood> its give us more freedom
[18:28:16] <Rockwood> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-lygbv?file=/demo.js now i am going to change things
[18:28:27] <Rockwood> grid
[18:28:52] <Rockwood> but right now my template not having grid
[18:29:07] <entuland> you should first make sure you fully grasp how that technique works, in isolation
[18:29:13] <entuland> for example, spot the difference: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/pqwk0xr5/2/
[18:29:18] <entuland> I've changed _one single thing_
[18:29:21] <entuland> what did I change?
[18:30:18] <Rockwood>     "c h h"
[18:30:19] <Rockwood>     "a a a"
[18:30:19] <Rockwood>     "i i b";
[18:30:22] <Rockwood> only this
[18:30:36] <entuland> that's three lines, I didn't change all three lines :P
[18:30:43] <entuland> I only changed one
[18:31:13] <Rockwood> yes first one
[18:31:19] <entuland> good
[18:31:29] <entuland> the important thing is that I did not touch the HTML
[18:32:07] <Rockwood> and another good thing its responsive
[18:32:16] <entuland> well, no, it's not
[18:32:41] <entuland> it adapts to the width but it's not really "responsive" as a flex layout would be
[18:33:28] <entuland> as it won't wrap when there isn't enough room for two cells in a row
[18:33:39] <entuland> to achieve that with a grid layout, you need media queries
[18:35:07] <entuland> crap, my key 6 on the top row just broke
[18:35:09] <entuland> that's bad
[18:35:35] <entuland> oh god

[20:00:06] <entuland> yeah you're making bit of a mess
[20:01:03] <entuland> as normal behavior, you can only assign areas to direct children of an element that has grid areas
[20:01:39] <entuland> if you want grand-children to be affected, you'd need the parent of such grand-children as "display: contents"
[20:02:13] <entuland> so that such parent is ignored and not considered (that actually makes the grand-children as being children of the grand-parent)
[20:02:30] <entuland> also, your main container was okay being flexed
[20:02:42] <entuland> so you've "broken" what you already had
[20:03:49] <Rockwood> yes
[20:03:50] <entuland> pseudo-structure: <flex><grid><...fields...></grid><grid><...fields...></grid><...more grids...></flex>
[20:04:05] <entuland> the fields need to be direct children of the grid
[20:04:22] <entuland> or, as above, you need to "ignore" any wrapper with display: contents;
[20:06:41] <Rockwood> still not very clear too me
[20:06:52] <Rockwood> still not very clear to me
[20:20:17] <Rockwood> [21:04:02] <entuland> pseudo-structure: <flex><grid><...fields...></grid><grid><...fields...></grid><...more grids...></flex> means i have make these tags?
[20:20:29] <entuland> hang on
[20:21:22] <Rockwood> ok
[20:22:39] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/5z7xmtvr/
[20:22:46] <entuland> the first is okay, because it has a flat structure
[20:23:20] <entuland> the second is broken because there is a wrapper around three and four, and it's not being ignored in any way (so its children can't be applied the grid-area declaration)
[20:24:13] <entuland> the fourth is worked around by ignoring the wrapper (notice how the last three and four are placed in the correct grid positions, but since they're not direct children of .gridded, they're not painted yellow
[20:25:02] <entuland> it is _very_ important that you understand things like this when using grid and flex - you need to know exactly what DOM structure you have (parent / children relationship) and you need to know exactly which CSS rules apply to which elements and why
[20:26:44] <Rockwood> i am studying code and trying to understand
[20:27:11] <Rockwood> yeah my requirement is nested
[20:27:45] <entuland> by nested you mean you need to have wrappers _inside_ the grids _around_ multiple fields?
[20:28:42] <entuland> beware, you don't have to use display: contents;
[20:28:42] <Rockwood> yes
[20:28:52] <Rockwood> ok
[20:29:02] <entuland> you may just apply the grid area to the wrapper instead of applying it to the wrapped fields
[20:29:07] <Rockwood> just by class name its possible
[20:29:27] <entuland> you can do whatever you want as long as your selectors match exactly what you want
[20:29:50] <entuland> doesn't matter using classes, IDs, tag names, positional selectors such as :first-child and so forth

[20:31:31] <entuland> doesn't matter using classes, IDs, tag names, positional selectors such as :first-child and so forth
[20:32:08] <Rockwood_> single class name always looks cleaner way
[20:32:46] <Rockwood_> i prefers just single class name and then select by tags

[20:33:50] <entuland> you shouldn't impose such rules of thumb on yourself
[20:34:18] <entuland> it really depends on whether having a class in the HTML makes sense or not

[20:34:53] <Rockwood_> i am getting your point about make work reasonable
[20:35:51] <Rockwood_> your point is valid
[20:36:58] <entuland> about assigning a grid-area to the wrapper instead: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/5z7xmtvr/1/
[20:37:13] <entuland> notice how the broken wrapper in the previous case took only one column
[20:37:47] <entuland> in this case the wrapper has an assigned area spanning two columns and the inner three and four do NOT have a grid area because they're not supposed to be affected by the grid
[20:38:43] <entuland> decide how you want it to look and then adapt the html and css in concert so that they agree with each other
[20:39:17] <hassoon> entuland: what's the *{padding:1rem} for ? seems an overkill
[20:39:35] <entuland> it's just to space boxes out and make it easier to see where one thing starts and the other ends

[22:33:52] <Rockwood_> oops something i am missing
[22:38:20] <Rockwood_> entuland, ^^
[22:39:06] <entuland> if you are going to implement a hover-like menu, don't do that
[22:39:46] <entuland> it's going to be a pain to get right on mobile - it's better to provide unified behavior
[22:40:23] <entuland> use <details> + <summary> to hide / show optional commands / fields
[22:40:45] <Rockwood_> okay
[22:41:41] <Rockwood_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details am correct?
[22:41:41] <entuland> that will give you open / close functionality on click out of the box without any JS and without any CSS, and will "just work" out of the box with tapping on mobile
[22:41:47] <entuland> yes
[22:41:54] <Rockwood_> adding that
[22:42:19] <entuland> I like to wrap the contents after summary to have better styling options
[22:42:24] <Rockwood_> details[open] what is the meaning of this
[22:42:44] <Rockwood_> []
[22:42:53] <entuland> that's another bit of CSS that you need to learn
[22:42:57] <entuland> try and find out
[22:43:36] <entuland> it's the same as [title='whatever'] or [id^="someidprefix-"]
[22:44:31] <entuland> this is how I normally implement it: <details><summary>click here</summary><div class="content">anything that needs to be hidden</div></details>

[22:53:54] <Rockwood_> z-index need there?
[22:55:30] <entuland> you didn't really grasp how that works
[22:56:14] <entuland> the "unit" is "<details+summary+content to be hidden>"
[22:56:37] <entuland> so if you want to nest them, you need to put another details+summary _inside the content to be hidden_

[23:07:02] <Rockwood_> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-lygbv?file=/gym.css changed
[23:07:08] <Rockwood_> entuland, am right?
[23:07:25] <Rockwood_> now new concern is how to select value in
[23:08:04] <entuland> you're using too "dummy" content to understand your end goal
[23:08:16] <entuland> use realistic dummy data that reflects what you want to really do

[23:12:36] <entuland> can't tell without knowing what you're going to put in there and what outcome you want

[23:29:06] <Rockwood_> i have to re think about it
[23:29:48] <entuland> also, you're focusing on the interface a lot, that's normally the last thing to sort out, first you need to define your data structures in a reasonable way

[23:30:59] <entuland> once you have the data structures and the API down (regardless of whether it's a real API you fetch from, it could be just functions inside your app, if all the data is local) _then_ you can think about the user interaction and the user interface
