[03:43:20] <causative> what can be said concretely and definitely, with demonstrable results, is worth talking about. What is about ineffable "style" or "greatness" is not.
[03:44:48] <brigand> what greatness?
[03:45:44] <causative> ineffable
[03:46:38] <causative> we can view it as the contrast between a "systemizing" perspective on truth, where ideas matter for their own factuality, or an "empathizing" theory on truth, that cares more about the social context of the ideas, who said them and who repeated them
[03:46:56] <brigand> oh, i see
[03:46:59] <causative> the "systemizing" perspective on truth ought to be preferred
[03:47:23] <causative> the "empathizing" perspective on truth is how we get a lot of bloviating over nothing, with revered icons that never said anything definitely true
[03:48:13] <causative> and also how we get the breakdown in discourse, where it matters less what you said than who you are and whether you're in the same tribe
[03:49:10] <causative> in matters of truth, we ought to revere facts and reason, not speakers, however great and respected the speaker may be
[03:49:38] <brigand> yeah, i still like bands even though their members are a*holes

[03:57:43] <causative> the only exception is when the subject is dominated by experts who take a systemizing perspective on truth within that subject, and when we ourselves lack necessary professional qualifications to judge truths within that subject for ourselves. In that case, an empathizing perspective on truth - where we look to the most respected experts -  is justified.
[03:58:32] <causative> but only in that case
[03:59:05] <causative> in all other cases, we should look to concrete facts, not people

[13:17:16] <pussipupu> what is they're waiting for interesting conversation starters?
[13:17:23] <pussipupu> *what if
[13:17:40] <Lumine> Then I can begin
[13:18:25] <Lumine> First, a short snippet on the wonder of discovery I wrote some time ago as an analogy for the question: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/OeGLgYNg/thoughts-on-discovery
[13:18:26] <ro-bot-o> [url] Snippet | IRCCloud | www.irccloud.com
[13:19:49] <Lumine> And I question whether we are as insignificant as people seem to think we are
[13:21:45] <pussipupu> To me it feels like a category error to say because the universe is large and we're small we're somehow less significant or important
[13:22:10] <pussipupu> Things, including people, are significant and important /to/ people, but in and of themselves
[13:26:28] <Lumine> I agree, but I admit I'm also guilty of feeling powerless and small in the midst of vastness
[13:27:18] <pussipupu> Like a kind of existential vertigo?
[13:28:18] <pussipupu> I get the same feeling sometimes, I think all we can do is accept our limited spheres of influence, and focus on that
[13:28:32] <Lumine> Yes, it is kind of like it. And I wanted to explore more of that feeling and ask what would the alternative to it be
[13:29:23] <Lumine> And so I ended up in a situation where I thought I was the centre of everything, that would be the other extreme
[13:30:08] <pussipupu> to some extent I say lean into the feeling
[13:30:47] <pussipupu> The universe is vast and magnificent beyond imagining, and as long as it doesn't paralyse you there's no harm in accepting and experiencing that
[13:30:59] <evolv> what does it mean to be insignificant?
[13:31:28] <brigand> It's just genetic programming to want to achieve more and more. It sounds good, but look at the state of the world.
[13:31:49] <evolv> there isn't any genetic programming to achieve more and more
[13:31:57] <evolv> it's genetically allowable, sure
[13:32:13] <brigand> to want to*
[13:32:38] <evolv> I wouldn't argue that genes push anyone towards a direction to achieve
[13:32:44] <evolv> achievement is a construct
[13:33:04] <Lumine> It's kind of like a balance act between wanting to make a difference and to not step on any toes. That is to pussipupu, the feeling of them both in practise.
[13:34:02] <evolv> it may be that we look to for ways to feel powerless because what we have power over, we're too afraid to change
[13:34:32] <Lumine> evolv: what if you don't care about power
[13:34:52] <evolv> that's one way of not feeling powerless, Lumine
[13:35:05] <pussipupu> most things are balancing acts if they're important at all, with multiple priorities in tension and sometimes in conflict
[13:35:06] <evolv> or the necessary way
[13:35:28] <brigand> :)
[13:35:35] <evolv> what is power? Control. What do we want to control?
[13:36:04] <evolv> like, at the root of control, what is there?
[13:36:10] <pussipupu> We want to control the UK -EU customs border
[13:36:15] <brigand> lel
[13:36:16] <pussipupu> that might just be me though
[13:36:19] <Lumine> Hehe
[13:36:51] <evolv> I wouldn't know, I'm kind of a hermit and don't buy very much
[13:37:25] <pussipupu> This is about things I'm ordering as part of my work, rather than professionally
[13:37:39] <pussipupu> rather than personally, even
[13:37:42] <brigand> the company i'm working for switched from uk lamps to chinese lamps ...
[13:37:42] <evolv> I was gonna ask
[13:37:43] <evolv> lol
[13:37:55] <evolv> yeah, I haven't requested anything to be shipped from my employer

[13:38:15] <evolv> I do have to ask for a second monitor, though. Using one of mine is suboptimal
[13:38:37] <evolv> what's wrong with that, brigand?
[13:39:24] <brigand> longer routes. less environmental friendly
[13:39:39] <Lumine> evolv: to your question and to explore this conversation some further, I would say we want to control our own minds in the end, but if we had ultimate control, we would come to a screeching halt
[13:40:07] <evolv> the parts probably come from China, anyway, brigand
[13:40:22] <brigand> also ironic, cause they shot themselves in the feet

[13:40:55] <Lumine> Hello arryana
[13:40:58] <Lumine> Thank you
[13:41:01] * arryana throws snowballs at pussipupu!
[13:41:06] <brigand> :)
[13:41:14] <evolv> Lumine, it's always interesting that we refer to our minds, when they misbehave, as a separate being
[13:41:26] <arryana> i dunno if my opinion is of any use to you, but i find being insignificant a massive relief.
[13:41:41] <Lumine> There can be solace in the feeling too true arryana
[13:41:57] <arryana> but i live my life according to triage rules.  the next most pressing thing, the next person's need, etc.
[13:42:06] <arryana> the more significant we are, the more obligated we are.
[13:42:23] <Lumine> Interesting
[13:42:32] *** Quits: ravan (~ravan@user/ravan) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:42:41] <evolv> that depends on what defines significance
[13:42:52] <arryana> when i was still a teenager, the local rescue squad unit came to talk to all the high school students.  they showed a video of... typical calls.
[13:43:03] <arryana> and the three of us who could watch the thing to the end, they came to talk to
[13:43:13] <arryana> 'you guys can stand it.  so... you have an obligation to help'
[13:43:24] <arryana> i served a year on the ambulance crew because of that, and they were right.

[13:43:30] * pussipupu returns fire and probably has more snow to hand
[13:43:34] <arryana> wooo!
[13:43:39] <arryana> yeah, there's only two or three inches here
[13:43:50] <arryana> lovely, though
[13:43:56] <Lumine> We have tons of snow
[13:44:03] <arryana> i ended up with three foster kids the same way
[13:44:15] <Lumine> We have so much snow in the winters, it's partly at fault why my nick name these days is Lumi
[13:44:16] <pussipupu> It's a shockingly beautiful day here
[13:44:16] <arryana> and then responsibility for my parents when they started failing
[13:44:27] <Lumine> pussipupu: same
[13:44:29] <arryana> so, significance obligates, the same as competence
[13:44:39] <pussipupu> except for the paths being treacherous
[13:44:51] <pussipupu> With great power comes great responsibility
[13:44:57] * arryana already shoveled the walk in front of hers and the elderly neighbors
[13:45:10] <arryana> another example of the same thing
[13:45:17] <arryana> do i have to shovel their walk?  hell no.
[13:45:21] <arryana> but... why wouldn't i?
[13:45:52] <evolv> because you're running late for work
[13:46:17] <arryana> running late is poor planning.  and i make my own hours
[13:46:36] <Delf> pussipupu: Flip that
[13:46:48] <arryana> i had a professor and friend who felt that being late was tantamount to making the claim that your time is more valuable than whomever is waiting for you
[13:46:52] <arryana> he was righ
[13:46:52] <arryana> t
[13:47:16] <arryana> now that's a curious statement.  do you seek power, delf?
[13:47:57] <Delf> No, I seek understanding and the consequence of that is power
[13:48:05] <arryana> oh man.
[13:48:11] <arryana> i'm not so sure i agree with that statement
[13:48:18] <arryana> knowledge is potential
[13:48:24] <arryana> but no more, unless it's used to a pudpose
[13:48:27] <brigand> nice. rescue squads should do that here
[13:48:28] <arryana> purpose
[13:49:11] <Delf> I'm good at that.. to purpose and to re-purpose
[13:49:25] <arryana> wow.
[13:49:58] <arryana> you must be better at time management than i am, i find that my responsibilities already outweigh my free time.
[13:50:37] <Delf> No, I suck shit at time management
[13:51:01] <arryana> huh.  how do you keep from failing in your responsibilities to other people, then?
[13:51:23] <Delf> My responsibilities to other people? I have no clue what that's suppose to mean
[13:51:50] <arryana> hm.  clearly we're missing a definition i thought we had in common
[13:52:13] <arryana> if your knowledge is being put to use enough to be called power, it has to be doing someone other than you some good
[13:52:30] <arryana> and if it's being used for someone else's benefit, that's an obligation they're counting on
[13:52:32] <arryana> no?
[13:53:25] <arryana> that's my experience of it, anyway
[13:55:05] <Delf> I did not say knowledge is power. I said the consequence of UNDERSTANDiNG, when it comes to me, is power. Understanding itself is not power.
[13:55:23] <arryana> hm.
[13:56:00] <Delf> I'm not bound by any obligations other than to honor my own values
[13:56:05] <arryana> i don't think i know what that means
[13:56:13] <Delf> That's alright, it happens :D
[13:56:27] <arryana> so nobody depends on you?
[13:56:37] <arryana> your knowledge/understanding is for you only?
[13:57:12] <Delf> I enjoy assisting others but I don't want others to depend on me
[13:57:29] <arryana> for me that loses the power of significance, as per lumi's original question
[13:58:55] <arryana> if nobody depends on you, what difference would it make if you and your knowledge fell off the face of the earth?
[13:59:21] <arryana> what purpose does your understanding serve?
[14:07:22] <Delf> I share my understanding. Not following lumi's original question. A few people would be in deep pain, for a short period of time. The purpose is guided evolution
[14:13:14] <arryana> that doesn't mean much from where i sit.
[14:13:27] <arryana> what do you think 'guided evolution' means in this context?
[14:14:01] <Delf> Making changes that're for the better instead of waiting for the universe to make them
[14:14:28] <arryana> how do you make any meaningful changes without someone depending on you?
[14:15:00] <Delf> Hmm.. that kind of power.. Well, people trust me. That puts me in position of power
[14:15:38] <arryana> i don't get what they trust you for, that they don't also rely on you in some way
[14:16:19] <Delf> For some things, they rely on me but that's not what my purpose is
[14:17:46] <arryana> what you're saying doesn't make sense to me.  how about a more concrete example
[14:18:34] <arryana> take my tiny volunteer contribution of knitted things.  the nurses rely on having a supply of caps/baby dresses, or they'd have to buy them or not supply them.

[14:19:06] <arryana> what changes are you making to the universe with your knowledge, if nobody depends on you?
[14:19:36] <arryana> what is the function of the understanding?
[14:20:32] <arryana> and i still don't know what you mean by 'guided evolution'
[14:21:21] <Lumine> It clearly means that there's a big daddy-o upstairs looking out for the physical processes of nature.
[14:21:36] <milkyogurt> d
[14:22:04] <arryana> i have no idea what that means either
[14:22:19] <arryana> if you don't make something of an effort to make more sense, i'm going to have to give up this conversation
[14:22:36] <brigand> ignore incoming
[14:22:51] <arryana> it -looks- like what you're saying is that you seek personal understanding for power and for god.
[14:23:02] <arryana> but i can't say i follow enough of what you say to make much sense of it

[14:24:56] <evolv> arryana, about what you said earlier
[14:25:04] <evolv> I'd argue that when it comes to work, yes, your time is more valuable :D
[14:25:04] <arryana> ?
[14:25:24] <evolv> the subject of being late
[14:25:27] <arryana> hm
[14:26:26] <arryana> this is where my professor friend did me an enormous favor when i was young.  he required me to fill out sheets of paper broken down into half hour, and later 15 minute, increments of what i -actually did- every day
[14:26:46] <arryana> since i had six classes and two jobs, i had very little free/wasted time.  but i still had some.
[14:27:19] <arryana> more importantly, it gave me a marvelous perspective on how much time is wasted unless one is viciously honest about where it's spent
[14:27:41] <evolv> yeah, like on work
[14:28:06] <arryana> i can't fool myself into believing that my life is so packed that i don't have twenty minutes to shovel the walk of elderly people out of decency and neighborly feeling
[14:28:24] <arryana> work or no, i still have that twenty minutes
[14:29:53] <Delf> These are both topic related questions and also related to other things that're whole other things such as the way I perceive things. There are many differences in our understanding of things. I help out with simple things, helping out people move, change winter/summer tires. Or they turn to me when they're having personal crisis or they don't know why they're having certain emotions or
[14:29:55] <Delf> problems
[14:31:12] <arryana> hm.  i consider that basic life requirements, not particular efforts.
[14:31:28] <Delf> The function of understanding is probably an extension of our navigation/orientation capabilities
[14:32:01] <arryana> i don't have any idea what you mean by that
[14:32:17] <Delf> Most don't
[14:32:31] <arryana> perhaps that means you need to clarify it, or that it doesn't mean that much.
[14:33:14] <arryana> 'other things that're whole other things'
[14:33:15] <Lumine> My fingers are frozen popcicles
[14:33:19] <arryana> haha
[14:33:41] <Delf> What you call reality is an "environment" so to speak. In order to navigate it, move about, it is beneficial to understand things so as to not hurt yourself or others
[14:35:27] <Delf> We fail to navigate if we lack necessary understanding
[14:35:57] <Delf> Of the environment or even our internals, feelings, thoughts etc
[14:36:31] <arryana> that seems to me to just make overmuch about basic life functioning.
[14:36:48] <Delf> Make overmuch? Not familiar with that term
[14:37:18] <arryana> it sounds like trying to elevate common sense beyond it's place as common sense.
[14:37:30] <arryana> my father would have said, 'it sounds like you need a medal for wiping your own ass'

[14:37:40] <arryana> but he was a crude man
[14:37:51] <arryana> not wrong about a lot, though
[14:38:00] <Delf> Hahahh
[14:38:46] <Delf> Just trying to answer your questions, not elevate any common sense :P I'm a simple man
[14:43:45] <Delf> Is knitting particular effort?
[14:44:26] <arryana> learning it is, at least for me.
[14:44:33] <arryana> the rest of it is just time and patience
[14:44:39] <arryana> i don't know if you consider that effort
[14:44:47] <Delf> Is it also NOT basic life requirements?
[14:44:57] <arryana> not for me, no.
[14:45:19] <Delf> Perhaps I'm missing the point in your example
[14:45:28] <arryana> hm
[14:45:57] <arryana> at least ten hours a week of whatever knitting i do is on things that are donated to the hospital for other people
[14:46:14] <arryana> so my knowledge/ability serves someone else.
[14:46:28] <Delf> I don't serve but I assist
[14:46:29] <brigand> maybe she just like virtue signalling
[14:46:33] <brigand> likes*
[14:46:43] <arryana> we all assist the people in our worlds, do we not?
[14:46:54] <Delf> No, some rather not
[14:47:02] <arryana> to me that just balances the scales of what other people do for us
[14:47:23] <Delf> To me, balancing scales is irrelevant
[14:47:58] <arryana> ah
[14:48:19] <brigand> you don't believe in karma?
[14:48:48] <arryana> from where i sit, balanced scales of effort vs what effort others spend on us is a baseline.  a requirement.  nothing exceptional.
[14:48:57] <arryana> but doing something above and beyond is also required of us, in my opinion.
[14:49:08] <arryana> to whatever our abilities allow
[14:49:23] <Delf> Which interpretation of karma, brigand? I can't keep track of them
[14:49:50] <brigand> +dict karma
[14:50:04] <brigand> oh, no chat
[14:50:09] <arryana> when i was young, i served on the ambulance crew.  later, i fostered kids.  then i cared for my parents, and now i knit, as i'm old.
[14:50:25] <Delf> Old? I don't recall you being old
[14:51:02] <arryana> the rest are my standard responsibilities, interpersonal things and work.  those are a given
[14:51:06] <arryana> i'm north of 50.
[14:51:10] <Delf> My memory sucks shit and I have no reason to remember what I've done for others
[14:51:20] <brigand> Delf: this is the most common i think: A force or law of nature which causes one to reap what one sows; destiny; fate.
[14:51:39] <brigand> well minus the destiny; fate part
[14:51:43] <Delf> No, thanks. If life gives me karma, I'll give it back.
[14:52:34] <evolv> karma is the only thing you take with you when you die
[14:53:01] <brigand> Delf: but you said you don't believe in balancing scales. or are you saying that never anything good has happened to you?
[14:53:04] <evolv> wave bye to your wealth, wave bye to your money, but karma, well, karma is tagging along with you
[14:53:13] <evolv> er
[14:53:17] <evolv> s/money/family :P
[14:53:17] <ro-bot-o> evolv meant to say: wave bye to your wealth, wave bye to your family :P, but karma, well, karma is tagging along with you
[14:53:28] <brigand> :P
[14:53:37] <arryana> i don't personally believe in karma.  but i do believe balance is necessary for a happy life
[14:53:43] <brigand> s/P/D/ :D
[14:53:43] <ro-bot-o> brigand meant to say: :D
[14:54:04] <evolv> karma just means intentional action

[14:54:06] <ro-bot-o> brigand meant to say: :P
[14:54:45] <brigand> evolv: you mean the literal translation?
[14:55:17] <arryana> i've been on an extended vipassana education retreat.  i don't believe in that sort of thing any more than i believe god, if there is one, gives any hoot about anyone.
[14:55:41] <Delf> To respond in kind is not any attempts for me to balance scales as it's not something for me
[14:57:47] <Delf> Good things happen to me all the time, what does that got to do with balancing scales?
[14:58:23] <evolv> brigand, the literal translation and intended meaning are the same
[14:58:34] <brigand> evolv: wiktionary says otherwise
[14:58:49] <evolv> what does wiktionary say?
[14:59:23] <arryana> i'm talking about balancing life.  balancing relationships.
[14:59:31] <arryana> nothing metaphorical
[14:59:36] <brigand> evolv: nothing about intentional
[15:00:25] <evolv> so it says "action"
[15:00:26] <evolv> I imagine

[15:02:52] <brigand> but it sounds too metaphysical for most people i think

[15:05:10] <evolv> kamma and karma are the same
[15:05:14] <evolv> kamma is Pali
[15:05:18] <evolv> karma is Sanskrit
[15:06:05] <evolv> generally, it means intentional action, but when applied to various spiritual belief systems, what it means in the overall system distinguishes the term
[15:06:55] <evolv> in Buddhism, kamma is both understood in the returns in this life and in the next
[15:07:06] * brigand looks at long lines of it being described as what he quoted and one line of pali translation. nods
[15:07:26] <evolv> hence good kamma can reap fruit in the here-and-now and in the next life

[15:10:48] <evolv> but you should be able to replicate it
[15:11:44] <arryana> i don't believe in the precepts of buddhism
[15:11:53] <arryana> oh, i've seen the teachings
[15:11:57] <arryana> i just still don't believe it.
[15:12:14] <evolv> there are ten

[15:12:36] <brigand> go vegan
[15:12:49] * Lumine is eating a hamburger
[15:12:50] <arryana> i've heard them all.  and i don't think it's the way to live.
[15:12:57] <arryana> you do you.  i'll do me.
[15:13:08] <arryana> preaching at me won't convince me.
[15:13:18] <evolv> not lying, not stealing, no sexual misconduct
[15:13:26] <evolv> no intoxicants
[15:13:30] <evolv> those are the first five
[15:13:34] <evolv> sound pretty good to me
[15:13:58] <arryana> yeah, you can stop trying to convince me.
[15:14:34] <Delf> arryana: The answer was to brigand. Have you ignored them?
[15:14:37] <evolv> I don't have to convince you, you know those five are the way to live
[15:14:42] <evolv> lol

[15:14:57] <brigand> Delf: yes, i'm a terrible person
[15:15:01] <arryana> you can live by whatever tenets you want.  and i'll do the same
[15:15:15] <arryana> so, respectfully, quit trying to shove your beliefs down my throat.
[15:15:36] <brigand> ignore incoming xD
[15:15:45] <evolv> I'm not. You're overreacting because anything religious in discussion revolts you
[15:16:09] <evolv> recall you intervened in a discussion not involving you
[15:16:22] <evolv> so when you intervene, I assume you're up for discussion on the subject
[15:16:29] <evolv> that was your choice
[15:16:33] * arryana sighs
[15:16:34] <evolv> don't make it again

[15:16:45] <arryana> if you don't like it, you can /ignore me
[15:17:04] <arryana> if you can't be polite enough to stop preaching at me, that's what it'll come to
[15:17:07] <evolv> I'm fine, just don't pretend that I was preaching when you got involved
[15:17:12] <arryana> you are preaching.
[15:17:16] <evolv> you got involved
[15:17:20] <arryana> but there's no point arguing this with you
[15:17:20] <evolv> don't get involved
[15:17:21] <arryana> so...
[15:17:23] <arryana> hahah
[15:17:32] <arryana> do you not get that this is a chat room, and everyone can get involved?
[15:17:58] <arryana> i always forget how rabid the religious get when other people don't swallow their beliefs.
[15:18:08] <evolv> I'm not going to interject in a conversation then get pissed someone is moving to me to on the subject of the conversation
[15:18:09] <evolv> that's silly
[15:18:20] <brigand> i saw no preaching
[15:18:32] <arryana> whatever, dude
[15:20:06] <Delf> arryana: I must admit to you. You seem curious and interested in what others have to say or what they think
[15:20:24] <Delf> Other than specials cases where they're simply not worth your time
[15:20:52] <brigand> yay, i'm special :D
[15:20:59] <arryana> of course i am.  people's perspectives are interesting.
[15:21:19] <Delf> I'm assuming that evolv noticed this interest and tried to explain and this seemed like preaching instead
[15:22:04] <Delf> brigand: No, you're not special. Only your case is special
[15:22:19] <brigand> :(
[15:22:38] <Delf> Relax mate, of course you're special. We're all special ;)
[15:22:48] <Lumine> If everyone is special...
[15:23:08] <evolv> then everyone is worth knowing
[15:23:10] <Delf> Then everyone is special hence normal is woo-woo talk
[15:23:33] <brigand> i'm confused. you're so confusing, Delf
[15:23:48] <evolv> if everyone is confusing...
[15:23:51] <arryana> i just don't much appreciate when anyone whose perspective is based on hope/faith/belief that i see no evidence of is presented as fact.
[15:23:56] <arryana> to me that seems dishonest
[15:24:54] <arryana> they're welcome to it.  but i want no part of it, and i don't want that mistaken in any way.
[15:24:55] <Delf> There might be some facts to what they're saying and the fact itself is that's what they believe :P

[15:25:25] <arryana> haha
[15:25:33] <arryana> i like your questions, lumi
[15:26:01] <evolv> we can discuss what "evidence" means
[15:26:12] <evolv> and how can we know if evidence is real
[15:26:22] <evolv> a discussion on epistemology
[15:26:46] <evolv> first, someone demonstrate, with evidence, ontological idealism is false
[15:26:51] <Delf> Evidence is what is sufficient enough for you to determine something. I heard my neighbor fart so this is evidence that there's god.
[15:27:10] <Lumine> ...
[15:27:50] <Delf> What... I'm not picky. I'll believe whatever, provided sufficient evidence
[15:30:41] * arryana makes lunch
[15:31:13] <Delf> Unicorns make me feel funny so that's enough evidence they exist... somewhere
[15:31:30] <Lumine> Well I for one will not believe whatever. I entertain points of views, for possibilities and inspiration. They're means to an end.
[15:32:33] <arryana> i can see the advantage of that.  i've come to an age where i focus on what i can see, taste, touch, smell, or have some concrete proof of
[15:32:33] <Delf> But you can't just entertain points of views without their accompanying feelings and emotions, that's just not right
[15:32:50] <arryana> as one author writes a character saying, 'i'll believe in ghosts when i can catch one in my teeth'
[15:33:01] <Lumine> Heh
[15:33:15] <Delf> I probably have a ghost stuck in my teeth
[15:34:59] <evolv> I have faith Japan exists despite not experiencing it with any of my sense bases
[15:35:09] <evolv> and I'd go as far as buy a ticket one day to go there
[15:35:31] <brigand> "those who believe in telekinesis, raise my hand"
[15:35:31] <pussipupu> Unicorns should always be approached from upwind
[15:35:50] <pussipupu> Like all rhinos they have limited sight and are easily startled
[15:35:53] <arryana> i know people who have been to japan.  i do not know anyone who has been past death and seen what's after
[15:35:56] <arryana> at least, nobody reliable.
[15:36:01] <arryana> haha
[15:36:10] <Lumine> Hah
[15:36:29] <evolv> a lot of reliable people have claimed to see ghosts
[15:36:30] <arryana> i believe virgins get special dispensation from unicorns, though
[15:36:35] <evolv> I never believed them
[15:36:40] <evolv> so those standards aren't useful
[15:36:42] <Delf> I don't imagine you being much more reliable should you return from death
[15:36:47] <arryana> nobody i would consider reliable
[15:36:50] <pussipupu> I'm almost certain that they don't and should be cautious
[15:36:57] <Delf> They're all we got
[15:36:58] <arryana> if ghosts were real, there'd be some scientific proof of them

[15:37:12] <arryana> haha
[15:37:18] <arryana> yeah, 'ghost hunters' on tv
[15:37:25] <arryana> the finest journalism, no doubt
[15:37:42] <evolv> that's a fun topic to discuss and move on to
[15:37:54] * arryana shrugs
[15:37:58] <evolv> while the studies may or may not be dubious wrt to ghosts, what we do know is publication bias
[15:38:01] <arryana> to me it's just more fantasy and wishful thinking
[15:38:18] <Delf> I'm off. Consider not fucking at each other. Take care!
[15:38:27] <evolv> there are many solid studies that haven't been published in good journals because of selection bias
[15:38:55] <evolv> one famous incident involved a gene associated with depression. Once the paradigm set in, studies providing evidence otherwise were rejected in peer review
[15:39:34] <evolv> eventually, the depression gene, I forgot of how long, was finally put to rest
[15:39:57] <pussipupu> Delf: i have no idea what you mean by "fucking at each other", just for the record
[15:40:30] <evolv> the publication process is largely bullshit
[15:40:35] <evolv> but it is what it is
[15:41:00] <evolv> if you're a member of the NAS, any paper you're an author on will be accepted in PNAS
[15:41:01] <evolv> lol
[15:41:23] <Lumine> I witnessed something weird briefly with 2 other people in 2006. Whether it was a ghost or some other apparition is anyone's guess. Personally I think it was a misalignment of the equipment and convenient moment. But a guitar "played itself" while we were in another room. We could hear what sounded like a clear chord. And then we checked the guitar and it was normal. G-g-ghoooosts
[15:41:55] <arryana> my other half's guitars often make noise in response to other vibration in the house
[15:42:06] <arryana> like the clothes washer on 1400 spin
[15:42:26] <Lumine> Well that's the thing, there was nothing in the apartment going on at the time
[15:42:33] <Lumine> Could've been the neighbour though
[15:42:48] <arryana> i'd have been more likely to believe it hadn't been put down carefully, and shifted
[15:42:56] <Lumine> Yeah
[15:43:24] <Lumine> Or you know, ghosts

[15:43:47] <Lumine> Hahah
[15:44:39] <evolv> speaking of myths
[15:44:52] <evolv> my wife's sister and brother-in-law believe in alpha theory with animals
[15:45:18] <evolv> specifically regarding dogs, which has been debunked, at least, in the 70s from the literature I've seen
[15:45:33] <arryana> they have an alpha, but it isn't just the bossiest person.
[15:45:45] <evolv> there are no alphas
[15:45:50] <arryana> they assign alpha to the pack member who can keep the most in mind that benefits the pack.
[15:45:52] * arryana shrugs
[15:45:53] <evolv> no
[15:45:56] <arryana> haha
[15:45:58] <evolv> wolves are in packs of families
[15:45:58] <arryana> believe what you like.
[15:46:03] <evolv> "alphas" are parents
[15:46:20] <evolv> the doctrine of faith that is science...
[15:46:37] <arryana> i've lived with wolves, and they can and do bond with non-family-members and create packs
[15:46:57] * Lumine is an omega male
[15:47:02] <arryana> haha
[15:47:15] <evolv> yes, it's a family structure
[15:47:21] <arryana> pack structure is all about playing to the strengths of the members to create a functioning whole
[15:47:40] <arryana> the roles are standard, but it's nowhere near as simple as 'family' or 'alpha/omega'
[15:47:47] <arryana> there's the leader, the caretaker, the sentry.
[15:47:53] <arryana> among others
[15:48:16] <evolv> are you familiar at all with this subject?

[15:48:35] <evolv> or is this something you observed where wolves formed a cooperative unit?

[16:25:27] <arryana> something in everything i read alters what i think, in some way
[16:25:46] <arryana> you?
[16:32:22] <arryana> i think the first books which made deep impressions on me were all quiet on the western front and the grapes of wrath
[16:32:49] <arryana> also lord of the flies, all three were when i was seven or eight, and they were quite the lesson in the largeness of the world.
[16:33:16] <arryana> by that i mean, not that the world is big, but how varied the experience of it can be.
[16:35:41] <evolv> I felt that way at 7 when I played Final Fantasy IV
[16:37:13] <Lumine> arryana: well it's true to an extent for me too, but I've read so few books in my life anyway. But I'd have to say when it comes to importance and how it affects me every day, I'd say either Steal Like an Artist or On Writing by Stephen King

[16:41:24] <arryana> i like the basic premises
[16:42:22] <Lumine> It's a short book but very much relevant if you're doing anything creative
[16:43:20] <Lumine> I read it in an hour or two in one sitting it was so interesting
[16:44:13] <arryana> i suspect i was lucky that way, my grandmother was fabulous about teaching us to make things
[16:44:55] <arryana> she had jars of buttons, string, rubber bands, pospicle sticks, paper clips, etc
[16:45:19] <arryana> when she'd put one or two out and let us loose on them, that'd keep us occupied for hours
[16:45:48] <evolv> if I have to babysit, I'll do that
[16:45:57] <arryana> she also taught me to sew and fix random things.  my other grandmother taught me to bead and make costume jewelry
[16:46:07] <evolv> I'll open the jar of paper clips, throw them around the room and have them play pick 'em up

[17:03:07] <evolv> Ungwelian, in that sense, which I thought of a funny joke I heard from Ajahn Brahm that I couldn't remember enough to retell right, it's how your actions shape your next life
[17:03:27] <evolv> if we think of a continuum of lives, where a life is just the birth of form that results in the end of said form

[17:11:49] <evolv> actions are reflective of our attachments, what we are attached to change, our actions reflect our response to that change
[17:12:29] <evolv> attachments are our chains to a particular existence that isn't stable

[17:38:14] <Ungwelian> It's very nihilistic.
[17:38:41] <Ungwelian> Life is precious.
[17:39:38] <evolv> it's a poor localization of the term
[17:41:15] <evolv> it's a conditioned being
[17:43:04] <evolv> the conditions in which are assumed to be self (anatta) invariably change (anicca), that change causes stress (dukkha)
[17:43:43] <evolv> so in Buddhism, suffering is due to the inability to accept that things change because we are so identified with those things
[17:44:48] <dispersed> and you can't accept it because the acceptance would change as well
[17:45:17] <dispersed> not surprising that trying the logically impossible would leave you in misery
[17:45:23] <evolv> no, acceptance of it results in nibbana
[17:45:54] <evolv> the eightfold path essentially is all about letting go

[19:03:51] <Jong> Is anyone here a fan of gen Z? Baby boomer generation I find lacks meta-thinking and don't think much. Like parents spanking there kids never asking questions like "If I'm hitting my kid because he did something I did not like, aren't I showing my kid that they should hit others who do stuff they don't like?"
[19:04:38] <arryana> 'a fan of gen z'?
[19:04:43] <arryana> i don't know what that means
[19:04:54] <arryana> and gen x is after the boomers
[19:05:31] <Jong> I was reading about comparisons between gen x and y against gen z too.
[19:06:07] <Jong> arryana gen z is much less into religion, thank goodness
[19:06:21] <audrey> I dated a gen Z woman briefly a few years ago and was not impressed, lol
[19:06:33] <arryana> do you feel that you're a product of whatever 'gen' you are?
[19:06:40] <audrey> It's kind of a turnoff to have someone unironically think Justin Bieber is the pinnacle of pop music
[19:06:42] <audrey> :P
[19:06:45] <arryana> i don't think those sort of generalizations are particularly helpful

[19:06:59] <arryana> my mother still thinks his name is 'justin beaver'
[19:07:12] <Jong> Sorry, let me clarify that I know generations are not homogenous groups.  But there are overall trends
[19:07:35] <audrey> arryana: Like the old joke (before he finally grew out a beard) - "BREAKING: Anonymous sources report Justin Bieber will be transitioning to male"
[19:08:22] <audrey> But yeah I don't think I have a generalized opinion of certain generations
[19:09:10] <Jong> For example, baby boomers are "less wasteful", even when it doesn't make sense such as when the time to save something from being wasted is greater than the time to throw it away and buy a new thing

[19:09:44] <arryana> i don't think those sorts of generalizations are anything but divisive

[19:11:02] <arryana> oops, wrong window
[19:11:09] <Jong> I didn't fact check online. I'm using the small sample set of people I've personally come across.   That's probably not a good idea?
[19:12:20] * arryana shrugs
[19:12:27] <Jong> Hmm... I wonder if anyone has ever researched whether the sample size of personal experience  jibes well against more exact population surveys.
[19:12:31] <arryana> do what works for you.  i wouldn't personally put much validity in it
[19:13:03] <arryana> i had a psychology/sociology professor many years ago who had her entire class of maybe 50 people make a list of generalizations about people
[19:13:14] <arryana> ie, they have two eyes, two legs, hair,
[19:13:23] <arryana> on and on, the list was maybe 25 traits long.
[19:13:48] <arryana> the next class she took us to a viewing platform in new york city, and we had to call out when we saw someone who did not have those traits
[19:14:23] <arryana> very quickly it became clear that all generalizations are meaningless in a large enough sample size.  when you're talking about an entire generation, i don't see what meaningful generalizations there are.
[19:14:55] <Jong> woah that's a great exercise by your professor !
