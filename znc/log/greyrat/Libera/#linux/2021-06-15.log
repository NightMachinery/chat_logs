[04:06:14] <lodek> Greetings, I have a question regarding the standard streams, their relation to file descriptors and the correct way to reference said streams. What's the correct way to reference the stdin? Is it through the file descriptor number defined in "unistd.h" (usually 0 afaik) or is through the "stdin" macro defined in "stdio.h"? I know I can reopen a file using "freopen", which means I could changed the
[04:06:15] <Psi-Jack> 2.5, however, was a non-stable kernel tree. :)
[04:06:16] <lodek> input file for the "stdin" macro or I could call close on fd 0 and then call open, which would return the lowest available unused fd, ie 0. Which is the correct semantic for a process? Is the fd number or the stdin macro the source of truth?

[04:52:27] <timj> i don't know macs, i just use google
[04:52:32] <jbis> Long story short, I am trying to trick macOS into thinking an rsync backup is a Time Machine backup. macOS identifies time machine backups using extended attributes. I've successfully replicated that part and macOS does now recognize it as a TM backup, but when I try to access it, I get permission issues. So I am comparing with a legit TM backup. In recovery, the legit TM backup shows 0:0, the fake one shows 99:99.
[04:52:52] <Psi-Jack> Unmm.. Why?
[04:52:53] <Psi-Jack> heh
[04:52:59] <Psi-Jack> rsync != time machine, period.
[04:53:08] <jbis> Yes, but I want trick macOS :D

[07:13:08] <coldenbrewed> What should I do to make show image a default along with having expanded videos players so I can watch them without clicking into the post itself?
[07:13:22] <coldenbrewed> It is just that reddit can give it better formatting is all
[07:13:27] <coldenbrewed> But sure^^
[07:13:47] <rascul> the way you put the words together don't seem to make sense to me
[07:13:51] <puff> But far more importantly it also removed all conflict of interest restrictions on media ownership, which led to massive consolidation of media ownership.  In 1996 there were 52 entities that owned national media. Now there are, what, 6?
[07:14:06] <rascul> or perhaps i'm missing context
[07:14:59] <coldenbrewed> rascul, let me rephrase then, how to display expanded images and videos in old reddit as default.
[07:15:15] <coldenbrewed> I have to click into the posts to see videos and go into the show image tab to see images
[07:15:15] <rascul> oh i have no idea
[07:15:23] <puff> Consolidation inevitably leads to commodification, commodification inevitably leads to razor thin profit margins, which means no money to do actual journalism.
[07:15:53] <rascul> coldenbrewed do you have an example reddit post that has images and videos so i could see what you're referring to?

[08:16:23] <sail0r> what does the dash do?
[08:16:28] <johnnyapol> Samian: waiting for transaction lock sounds like something else is running that acquired the lock. i'd look around to see if any updates are in progress if an update was interrupted the lock may need to be manually deleted

[10:19:21] <eirikb> docker is great, but why use it when the script would do it. I actually hardly use docker for nodejs on CI though (in Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Jenkins), there's usually a task/action to pull down correct node version. This download makes the CI pipeline interact better with other steps if there is anything beside build. Hence again my script

[15:43:38] <iflema> and works well until a conflict
[15:43:51] <rudi_s> If you use Git you can just perform the changes on the source code and let it generate the diff for you. E.g. with git add . ; git diff --staged

[18:33:58] <akk> alzgh: That varies depending on how your displays are set up. You might be able to do it purely with coordinates.
[18:34:28] <akk> alzgh: For instance, if your leftmost monitor is 1600x1200, then an x coordinate of 1700 would put the terminal window on the second monitor.

[19:49:20] <DagmarX> arash: Just because you're using 8-bit doesn't make it not a 7-bit standard.  It's just handy that you can easily stuff 7-bits into 8 and have one spare

[19:51:19] <BCMM> johnjay: because it's a "hello world" using a huge framework
[19:51:27] <prussian> doing it manually by invoking a c compiler is just not worth it to me nowadays

[21:58:02] <z1haze> so do i need to change anthing behind the scenes of my current installation ?
[21:58:09] <DagmarX> One minute you're just trying to talk to AD and the next, you're taking kerberos straight to the eyes
[21:58:29] <uwharrie> tusko: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg/Keyboard_configuration#Configuring_compose_key is one method
[21:58:34] <DagmarX> See if `realm discover` actually reports a domain present on the network
[21:58:50] <z1haze> i installed samba, krb5-config winbind and smbclient, (following a tutorial)
[21:59:11] <z1haze> i went through the default configuration of krb5, set the realm, domain, etc
[21:59:28] <DagmarX> Well, with RHEL 7 and newer you should probably be using `realm` isntead of anything involving `net join`
[21:59:35] <uwharrie> not sure what the method is for wayland or if it has one

[23:17:41] <z1haze> well this is linux, samba setup
[23:18:08] <jim> in order to "scrape", you feed the html page to the parser

[23:19:02] <byte4byte> python is just for printing text and exiting

[23:41:47] <ayecee> well shoot.
[23:42:01] <ayecee> they don't have to exist on the linux machine if you're using AD and it's configured correctly.

[23:44:42] <z1haze> but that number points to literally nothing, we made it up
[23:45:07] <z1haze> you just said use 10000, so i used 10000 .. what its just a made up number
[23:45:08] <ayecee> on a correctly configured system it would point to the AD user.
[23:45:27] <ayecee> such a system has a PAM module that looks up users in AD.

[23:46:36] <ayecee> perhaps they assume that a certain amount of setup has been done before you start the tutorial
[23:46:49] <ayecee> or, they only cover a narrower part that doesn't involve that
[23:47:09] <z1haze> https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Adding_users_with_samba_tool "When running Samba 4 as an Active Directory domain, unlike Samba 3, you cannot have a local Unix user for each Samba user that is created."

[23:47:48] <ayecee> doesn't apply, does it?
[23:48:01] <ayecee> you don't have a unix user with the same name, do you?
