[00:03:50] <raccoon_dog> Thanks.
[00:04:22] <raccoon_dog> The word you wanted, though, was "vandal" -- when you said "destroyed," I thought you meant completely demolish.
[00:04:30] <raccoon_dog> But "graffiti" later on clarified the actual meaning.
[00:04:47] <raccoon_dog> That would be an act of vandalism, as someone said before.

[00:17:14] <TechTest> what does this mean?
[00:17:25] <TechTest> non English English

[00:23:40] *** raccoon_dog_ is now known as raccoon_dog
[00:23:42] <TechTest> The English word vandalism derives from the French word, vandalisme, and was first seen in print in 1794 when the Bishop of Blois, Henri Grégoire, included the term in a report of the mayhem, and in particular the destruction of art, that occurred during the French Revolution
[00:23:58] <raccoon_dog> Yes ... the first three words. "The English word"
[00:24:06] <raccoon_dog> Hence, it is a word of English.
[00:24:22] <raccoon_dog> I think what you may mean is that its etymology isn't Anglo-Saxon or Germanic.
[00:24:30] <raccoon_dog> As you may expect from a Germanic language like English.
[00:24:50] <onmra> If your point is that it's derived from French, then you're going to erase 50% of the vocabulary. :P
[00:25:09] <raccoon_dog> But that's OK -- many English words are, in fact, derived from Latin, Greek, older Anglo-Saxon dialects that evolved into English, and loanwords from other languages.
[00:25:15] <raccoon_dog> This is completely normal.
[00:26:21] <TechTest> I didn't mean quite that  -.-
[00:26:52] <raccoon_dog> Well, regardless, the statement "vandalism isn't an English word" is an objectively false statement.
[00:27:01] <TechTest> I didn't say it's not normal, there are other things in English I find abnormal for sure, this isn't one of them 
[00:27:09] <raccoon_dog> I see.
[00:27:16] <TechTest> raccoon_dog: ok, I guess
[00:28:21] <raccoon_dog> I mean, this is how natural human languages work. Native speakers start using them, dictionaries start incorporating them and thus a language's corpus is collected.
[00:28:31] <raccoon_dog> "them" as in words.
[00:30:34] <TechTest> only if computer languages were working like that 
[00:30:38] <onmra> What would be some examples of words developed by non-native speakers added to the standard?
[00:31:34] <TechTest> the previous WotD "peripatetic" was one 
[00:32:07] <raccoon_dog> onmra: One example that occurs to me, but that is a bit technical, is in mathematics. In mathematics, one often speaks of "uniqueness" of a solution, which is the usual way to say it in English. But I've often seen papers that speak of "unicity" when referring to the same concept.
[00:32:32] <raccoon_dog> This is because in some languages, that's what the word looks like -- in Spanish, for instance, it's "unicidad."

[01:01:33] <LuisM14> not like this one's not an English word (either)
[01:02:36] <raccoon_dog> In that specific usage, yeah. There's another usage of "unicity" which is more general (which means "the fact of being or consisting of one, or of being united as a whole".)

[01:50:51] <sv> English is so much easier to type than German. For example, in the previous and this sentence, in only have to type the words "English" and "German" capitalized.

[01:54:51] <LjL> all-noun capitalization used to not be exclusive to German, at some point it was common in English as well
[01:55:00] <LjL> maybe all the other languages eventually dropped it for a reason ;P
[01:58:05] <TimMc> Shift keys were hard to find 400 years ago.
[01:59:04] <LjL> that may have been one reason, but i think it was probably dropped before Shift keys were a thing...?

[02:00:23] <raccoon_dog> What? That's a silly rationale.

[02:00:38] * raccoon_dog canned laughter.
[02:00:54] <TimMc> Just look at old Latin documents -- all capitals.
[02:01:04] <LjL> that's not entirely true
[02:01:12] <LjL> romans had a cursive, which developed into our lowercase
[02:01:33] <LjL> but, it's true that they wrote in either cursive or capitals, it's not like they mixed them for initial letters or anything
[02:02:56] <LjL> a lot of tablets in old roman cursive (which is one of two they had over time) were found at Vindolanda, now in England, they were letters from soldiers
[02:03:24] <LjL> you can check them out online and have fun trying to decipher their writing, which if i'm any indication, is *not* easy even after you nominally learn the letters

[02:46:15] <mdogg> "Hit up" meaning call or talk to..
[02:46:26] <mdogg> Or "Hit that girl up"
[02:47:17] <raccoon_dog> "Hit up" has connotations of approaching someone to ask for something, like money, though.
[02:47:21] <GuiToris> I think that's it what raccoon_dog said, I looked it up and it seemed a nice word, btw, google suggested 'hit on' I'm not sure if that is a valid phrase
[02:48:09] <raccoon_dog> Well, "hit on" is to flirt but with more of the sexual element. Like you're making it obvious that want you want sex.
[02:48:16] <raccoon_dog> "To flirt" may be more playful.
[02:48:29] <raccoon_dog> s/that want/that what
[02:48:30] <tinsoldier> r​accoon_dog meant: Well, "hit on" is to flirt but with more of the sexual element. Like you're making it obvious that what you want sex.
[02:48:36] <mdogg> True - nobody would suggest "hitting on" somebody.  But they would describe what someone is going as 'hitting on' them...
[02:49:53] <GuiToris> got it, thanks, I only knew 'hit on the idea' and I wasn't sure if I could use that, 'ask out' sounds nicer though :)

[02:51:38] *** Joins: ralinux (~saje@37.156.190.205)
[02:51:58] <mdogg> That's a pretty common statement now days.
[02:52:29] <raccoon_dog> Well, you have to add the "I think she likes you" part of the sentence.
[02:52:43] <raccoon_dog> Because just talking to someone doesn't necessarily mean, "Try and start a romantic relationship with this person."
[02:53:19] <mdogg> That's true.
[02:54:46] <GuiToris> I think, You should go talk to Kasey, doesn't really carry the meaning of 'you should ask her out'
[02:54:57] <raccoon_dog> Right. That could be anything.
[02:55:20] <mdogg> Exactly.  But during a casual conversation someone could ask her to go bowling Friday night.
[02:55:26] <raccoon_dog> "You should go talk to Kasey. I think she's still upset about you spilling coffee all over her new dress."

[02:58:32] <GuiToris> I found this example: Dave has hit on most of the women in the department. Does this sentence mean Dave had sex with those women?
[02:58:55] <raccoon_dog> No, it means he propositioned those women for sex. Whether the women agreed or not is another separate issue.
[02:59:19] <raccoon_dog> But I suspect that sentence really means, "Dave is a creep. Avoid him."
[02:59:26] <raccoon_dog> That seems to be the implication.

[03:17:46] <mdogg> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Stylebook
[03:18:10] <GuiToris> thanks, I've never heard this
[03:18:13] <raccoon_dog> GuiToris: Well, that's fine according to the Chicago Manual of Style. It's a style issue -- and the other alternative is fine as well.
[03:19:05] <raccoon_dog> Also, re: pronunciation of 's and the like: https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/5913/what-is-the-pronunciation-of-the-possessive-words-that-already-end-in-s
[03:19:19] <mdogg> Well, the Associated Press has standards for their writers that are world wide. 
[03:20:01] <raccoon_dog> mdogg: I think there's an important caveat that people miss -- the AP Stylebook is meant for *journalism*. 
[03:20:17] <raccoon_dog> Because that's what the Associated Press is. A news agency.
[03:20:30] *** Quits: amahl (~amahl@dsl-jklbng12-54fbca-64.dhcp.inet.fi) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:20:43] <raccoon_dog> So, someone writing poetry isn't going to care much for what the AP Stylebook says.
[03:22:15] <mdogg> That's true.
[03:22:44] <mdogg> I was taught to use a serial (or Oxford) comma, and to put two spaces after a period.
[03:24:08] <mdogg> I don't know what style that is, but a single period at the end of a sentence does bother me.  Not as much as putting a comma before "and" in a series but I always notice that too. 
[03:24:19] <TimMc> GuiToris: The relevant thing, here, is that these stylebooks are used in a prestige dialect of written English -- so you can be sure both are broadly "acceptable".
[03:25:05] <mdogg> That's true.  Not putting two spaces after a period in a sentence and not using a serial comma are both acceptable English.
[03:25:08] <raccoon_dog> mdogg: I think the two spaces after a period thing was prevalent during the typewriter days. I guess on an IRC client with a monospace font it would also make sense.
[03:25:25] <GuiToris> Does someone know Ohioian dialect? I talked to someone who was born and raised in Ohio and he found my pronunciation women (wimin) weird, he was quite convinced that woman is wuhMAAN and women is wuhMen
[03:25:39] <mdogg> raccoon_dog: I think it makes things easier to read.  That's why I still do it.
[03:25:39] <raccoon_dog> But by and large, that's not really a norm these days.
[03:25:52] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, it does help with monospace fonts, I do agree.
[03:25:56] <TimMc> GuiToris: The only difference for me is in the first syllable, when spoken.
[03:26:21] <TimMc> I don't know if I know anyone with a dialect like you describe.
[03:26:29] <mdogg> I don't think the font matters.  I think it always makes sentences easier to read.
[03:27:04] <GuiToris> TimMc, I don't like correcting native speakers, it makes me sound smart aleck
[03:27:16] <raccoon_dog> I guess I notice it more with monospace fonts, if that makes sense. Since spacing isn't "consistent" on other kinds of fonts, it doesn't register as much.
[03:28:21] <GuiToris> TimMc, he just said, it wouldn't be spelled with an 'o' if it were ~'i'
[03:28:59] <raccoon_dog> That isn't a good argument when discussing pronunciation of English words, a language where letters can represent multiple phonemes or sounds.
[03:29:29] <LuisM14> all three exist
[03:30:25] <GuiToris> raccoon_dog, I showed him some audio examples from the Internet but he couldn't do much with the new information. It's odd that he never heard 'wimin'
[03:33:17] <TimMc> That's very odd.
[03:34:17] <mdogg> What is wimin?
[03:34:54] <GuiToris> mdogg, more properly ˈwɪmɪn
[03:35:00] <GuiToris> (IPA)
[03:35:18] <mdogg> I can't locate that word.
[03:35:37] <GuiToris> how would you pronounce 'women'?
[03:35:46] <GuiToris> is it like man vs men?

[03:37:36] <TimMc> mdogg: The point is that GuiToris's Ohio acquaintance had a strange opinion about it.
[03:37:55] <onmra> They can't have done such a bad job that you need to hit them?
[03:38:36] <mdogg> There are lots of words in English that are pronounced differently than they are spelled.

[03:40:57] <GuiToris> ok, then it's a miracle why he said 'wuhmen'
[03:41:36] <GuiToris> (and he stressed the second syllable in both words (woman, women)
[03:42:05] <LuisM14> likely to stress the difference
[03:42:25] <GuiToris> hmm, yes, maybe you're right
[03:42:35] <onmra> That sounds like a Caribbean accent.
[03:46:14] <GuiToris> onmra, it's more convincing if a native speaker says something. He also said that American kids overuse the passive voice, and teachers try to discourage students from doing that. He claimed that 'my car is stolen' is worth less points (in an essay) than 'they stole my car'
[03:47:05] <onmra> What's up with that?
[03:47:17] <raccoon_dog_> That's because people pretend Strunk & White comes straight from God.
[03:47:31] <raccoon_dog_> But the fact is that the passive voice has valid usage cases in English.
[03:47:51] <raccoon_dog_> This has to be one of the most common misconceptions I keep seeing everywhere.
[03:48:20] <LuisM14> stop conceiving, please!
[03:48:29] <GuiToris> I agree, but I don't want to believe that an active sentence is always more worthy
[03:48:33] * LuisM14 chuckles
[03:49:05] <GuiToris> he said young kids often say 'the TV is watched by me' ... and this sounds stupid indeed
[03:49:12] <mdogg> "My car is stolen." should be worth less points than "They stole my car.".  
[03:49:21] <GuiToris> maybe they speak like that in Ohio
[03:49:25] <mdogg> "My car is stolen" is not correct.  
[03:49:35] <raccoon_dog_> Yeah, in any case, "My car *WAS* stolen."
[03:49:44] <raccoon_dog_> That sounds more idiomatic.
[03:49:46] <mdogg> "My car has been stolen." is correct.  Also, "They stole my car." is correct.
[03:49:56] <raccoon_dog_> Yeah, or you can also use a perfective form like that.
[03:49:59] <mdogg> My car WAS stolen" is also correct.
[03:50:00] <raccoon_dog_> And not the bare past simple.
[03:50:23] <LuisM14> not like they're watching it being stolen :3
[03:50:36] <raccoon_dog_> GuiToris: "The TV is watched by me" does sound odd.
[03:50:46] <mdogg> Then you would say, "They're stealing my car."
[03:50:58] <raccoon_dog_> But the wholesale rejection of the passive voice is kind of overkill.
[03:51:08] <LuisM14> unless classify it as adjective state

[03:52:38] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, I guess that isn't passive voice, but "to be" + "adjective." And not a passive voice construction with the verb "to be" + "past participle."
[03:52:58] <mdogg> My car was stolen.
[03:53:06] <LuisM14> can be viewed either way, imo
[03:53:27] <GuiToris> raccoon_dog, I have problems with that!
[03:53:28] <mdogg> You cannot say, "My car is stolen." and be grammatically correct.  
[03:53:42] <GuiToris> especially with 'open'
[03:53:56] <GuiToris> is the door open or opened
[03:54:54] <LuisM14> as i see it, it's state vs action there :p
[03:55:34] <GuiToris> LuisM14, my car will have been being stolen
[03:55:44] <LuisM14> haha
[03:57:35] <mdogg> Or 'Will have being stolen'

[03:58:09] <mdogg> no
[03:58:32] <mdogg> Stolen is already past. 
[03:58:40] <LuisM14> that didn't make sense to me
[03:59:00] <GuiToris> in my language we don't use the word 'lock' and I tend not to use it in English either, and once I said 'I couldn't get in, the door was closed', and they asked me why I didn't open it then!

[04:14:33] <mdogg> This isn't the channel for trolls.
[04:14:37] <onmra> "I was summoned in Ohio."
[04:17:33] <LuisM14> a verb can have both transitive and intransitive senses

[08:06:22] <twb> er, "U.E." and "EE.UU."
[08:07:18] <raccoon_dog> The Royal Spanish Academy, however, recommends EE.UU. or EUA. Note the lack of periods for the second option.
[08:07:59] <twb> Also note that "United States of America" also applies to Mexico
[08:09:07] <raccoon_dog> Well, Mexico is, officially, "Estados Unidos Mexicanos" in Spanish -- United Mexican States.
[08:09:24] <twb> exactly
[08:09:32] <twb> oh misread
[08:09:48] <raccoon_dog> So, they're both federations that are "United States" of some sort.

[08:15:38] <raccoon_dog> So even there, the distinction of "North" and "South" does exist.
[08:15:53] <raccoon_dog> Just not as distinct continents.

[08:21:23] <raccoon_dog> Oh, so it's like "gobbledygook."
[08:21:48] <TimMc> ...is that where the slur "gook" comes from?
[08:22:02] <raccoon_dog> > Según el etimólogo español Joan Corominas, "gringo" deriva de la palabra española griego, refiriéndose a un lenguaje que no se puede entender (como en la frase inglesa: that's Greek to me) y por extensión a personas que hablan cualquier otro idioma que no sea español, de manera similar a términos como bárbaro (βάρβαρος) en griego clásico.
[08:22:07] <raccoon_dog> Spanish Wikipedia ^
[08:22:16] <raccoon_dog> This does seem to confirm that etymology with a bunch of sources.
[08:22:20] <twb> nalkri: re "watered down espresso", that sense comes from GIs invading Italy not knowing how to drink espresso

[08:24:03] <onmra> "Gook" could possibly come from a specific word, so not exactly the same.
[08:24:58] <raccoon_dog> > Folk etymology suggests that during the Korean War, young Korean children would point at U.S. soldiers and shout in Korean 美國 (Miguk, “America”). Soldiers heard the word as “me gook”, as if the children were defining themselves as “gooks”. The soldiers proceeded to use that term to refer to the Koreans. The word 국 (國, guk) itself simply means “country”. This explanation ignores the fact that there are many ex
[08:24:59] <raccoon_dog> amples of the word's use that pre-date the Korean War.
[08:25:03] <raccoon_dog> From Wiktionary.
[08:25:12] <raccoon_dog> It's a "folk etymology," though.

[11:23:33] <drbean> What about with an inappropriate date however, "Current members as of 2000, the date of its founding, are:"
[11:23:48] <drbean> Seems contradictory.
[11:27:11] <Maxdamantus> "as of" to me seems like "since".
[11:27:33] <Maxdamantus> "as at" seems like a way of specifying that something was true at a particular time.
[11:31:10] <Maxdamantus> I remember changing something on Wikipedia a number of years ago because it said "as of" and it seemed unclear to me what it actually meant.
[11:31:26] <Maxdamantus> So I looked into the sources and then changed it to "as at".
[11:32:33] <Maxdamantus> actually, nvm, that was changing "as of" to "on".
[11:32:37] <Maxdamantus> https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Death_row&diff=prev&oldid=555344340
[11:35:25] <drbean> It was: "There were approximately 3,146 people on death row in the United States as of October 1, 2012."
[11:38:53] <drbean> That sounds like the intention is to extrapolate from that date to now (??)
[11:40:45] <Maxdamantus> No, I guess either use of "as .." makes it sound like it could be a running count.
[11:41:12] <Maxdamantus> "as of Jan 2010, there were 2 billion views"
[11:41:22] <twb> I think "as of" for date and "as at" for datetime
[11:41:43] <twb> cf. "kill him at 9AM" vs "kill him on Friday"
[11:42:14] <Maxdamantus> I don't think that really applies to the "as as"/"as of" construction.
[11:42:26] <Maxdamantus> s/as as/as at/
[11:42:27] <tinsoldier> M​axdamantus meant: I don't think that really applies to the "as at"/"as of" construction.
[11:42:33] <twb> best explanation I can give for what "feels right" to me
[11:42:47] <twb> I was going to initially say "as at" for precise timestamps
[11:43:56] <Maxdamantus> regarding my "2 billion views" example, compare: "in Jan 2010, there were 2 billion views"
[11:44:07] <Maxdamantus> or "on Jan 1 2010, there were 2 billion views"

[18:14:02] <darsie> ok
[18:15:29] <drbean> I think Maxdamantus was right. The number on death row was n on 2012-01-01, because it's not a cumulative total and it goes up and down. And the right answer to the number on death row not the number today, or any one date.
[18:15:56] <drbean> But what about, 'last week'?
[18:17:15] <drbean> Not, 'Last week the number on death row was n', but 'As of last week, the number on death row was n'.
[18:18:46] <drbean> The right answer is how many TODAY, because it's a different situation, and we only have figures for last week, so 'as of'. ??
[18:20:45] <drbean> There are 2 sentences in the wikipedia death row article with 'as of', the 2nd and 3rd after the one Maxdamantus changed from 'as of' to 'on'. Should they be changed also?
[18:21:03] <drbean> A: How many are on death row?
[18:21:32] <drbean> B: Last week the number on death row was n.

[19:10:51] <WeAreElectricity> r3 I don't know about which or what in that case, cause people here really use whatever they want, but typically "which" suggests that it's one among a set of options
[19:11:44] <WeAreElectricity> e.g., I'd use "I forgot which day we're meant to be there" if I already had a couple options in mind
[19:12:06] <WeAreElectricity> "Was it next Monday or Thursday? I forget which day we're supposed to meet again"
[19:12:50] <WeAreElectricity> make sense?
[19:13:02] <LuisM14> pretty good
[19:14:02] <WeAreElectricity> then "what day" might sound okay if you're talking carelessly, but otherwise "when" sounds way better than "what day"
[19:14:46] <darsie> Is the reaper wielding a reaper?
[19:14:46] <WeAreElectricity> of course in context saying "what day" may actually be more precise than using "when", e.g., if you forgot about the day but not about the time you were supposed to meet

[22:51:25] <mountain> Which one is correct, "Greek language" or "Greek Language"?
[22:51:53] <blkshp> The Greek language.
[22:52:21] <raccoon_dog> "Greek language," typically. However, if this is the title of something (like a newspaper article), "Language" would also be capitalized.
[22:53:17] <mountain> Aren't county and parish names always capitalised though, "He lives in Vermilion Parish" like?
[22:55:10] <Babar> would "Parish" be part of the name of the Parish?
[22:55:11] <mountain> Both "Greek Language" and "Lincoln County" both proper nouns?
[22:55:23] <Babar> "He lives in the parish of Vermillion Parish"? :D
[22:55:27] <mountain> s/Both/Aren't/
[22:55:28] <tinsoldier> m​ountain meant: Aren't "Greek Language" and "Lincoln County" both proper nouns?
[22:55:57] <blkshp> No. Well not that I believe and would argue against.
[22:56:12] <raccoon_dog> mountain: is "County" part of the name of that region?
[22:56:12] <blkshp> What is the context.
[22:56:13] <blkshp> ?
[22:56:41] <Babar> "He is an Ethiopian Boy"? :D
[22:56:42] <Babar> (no)
[22:56:57] <blkshp> A good example.
[22:57:02] <raccoon_dog> No; "Ethiopian boy."
[22:57:28] <mdogg> We capatolize "County" if we're referring to a specific county, such as "Sacramento County".   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_County,_California
[22:57:44] <mountain> Babar: I thought about this exact thing. "Greek" is not an adjective here, but "Ethiopian" is.
[22:58:13] <Babar> in "Greek language", "Greek" is not the adjective?
[22:58:18] *** Joins: farciarz84 (~farciarz8@host17.14.127.128.generacja.pl)
[22:58:31] <raccoon_dog> Specifically, "Ethiopian" is an adjective that is derived from a proper noun. These are usually capitalized.
[22:58:55] <mountain> raccoon_dog: Of course they are. The question is about capitalisation of "boy".
[22:59:12] <raccoon_dog> "boy" is a common noun. Those are never capitalized.
[22:59:25] <raccoon_dog> (Unless it's the first word of a sentence.)
[22:59:40] <Babar> unless "county" and "parish" are part of the names, they'd not be proper nouns either
[22:59:44] <raccoon_dog> Right.
[23:01:40] <mountain> Babar: No. The equivalent example there would be "German Language is an Indo-European language", as the "German" is not an adjective but "Indo-European" is. I just thought so.
[23:02:26] <raccoon_dog> For that, you'd just say, "German is an Indo-European language."

[23:02:39] <raccoon_dog> That "Language" there is awkward and unidiomatic.
[23:02:40] <mdogg> ^ Language doesn't need to be capitalized.  
[23:03:01] <raccoon_dog> It's not that it doesn't need to be capitalized or not -- you can just get rid of the word as a whole.
[23:03:05] <mountain> mdogg: It generally isn't. I'm asking if I can be?
[23:03:16] <mountain> raccoon_dog: I have to use the word.
[23:03:37] <mdogg> No, it would not be in any of the above examples.
[23:04:03] <raccoon_dog> mountain: I see. Well, in that case, "The German language is an Indo-European language." A bit repetitive, but it works. Or maybe "The German language is Indo-European."
[23:04:11] <mdogg> You could say:  "The German language is an Indo-European language."
[23:04:15] <raccoon_dog> If you want something more concise.
[23:04:39] <mdogg> Yep..  Those work too.
[23:08:52] <mountain> How about "Hudson River" or "Hudson river"?
[23:09:19] <mdogg> It would be Hudson River because that's a proper name.
[23:09:39] <raccoon_dog> "Hudson River" is the full name of the river.
[23:09:43] <mdogg> ^
[23:09:44] <raccoon_dog> So "River" is also capitalized.
[23:10:49] <mountain> So, "German Language" is not a proper noun? I always thought it was. It doesn't refer to "any language from Germany". It's a specific-language, isn't it?
[23:11:27] <mountain> s/-//
[23:11:27] <tinsoldier> m​ountain meant: So, "German Language" is not a proper noun? I always thought it was. It doesn't refer to "any language from Germany". It's a specificlanguage, isn't it?

[23:11:34] <tinsoldier> m​ountain meant: So, "German Language" is not a proper noun? I always thought it was. It doesn't refer to "any language from Germany". It's a specific language, isn't it?
[23:11:57] <raccoon_dog> No; "German" there is an adjective, and "language" is a common noun. Usually it means the language commonly spoken in Germany (and parts of Switzerland, and Austria, etc.), yeah.
[23:12:53] <raccoon_dog> It /could/ mean a language commonly spoken in Germany, but that specific language, Deutsch, is the one well-known language spoken there as far as I know.
[23:13:06] <twb> the name of the language is "German" not "German Language"
[23:13:07] <raccoon_dog> Compare that with "Swiss language" -- many languages are spoken in Switzerland.
[23:13:27] <twb> "What is your native tongue?"  "It is German."
[23:14:11] <raccoon_dog> However, "Spanish language" is confusing. It could mean the Romance language spoken throughout Spain, Central and South America, etc. Or it could refer to one of the many languages spoken in Spain (which are not necessarily Spanish.)
[23:14:37] <mountain> raccoon_dog: There are many languages where names don't refer to nationality or ethnicity.
[23:14:43] <raccoon_dog> Right.
[23:15:01] <raccoon_dog> Like "French" -- spoken in parts of Canada, and not just France.
[23:15:23] <raccoon_dog> Or, well, English.
[23:15:51] <mountain> raccoon_dog: No, there too it could be thought of "the language from France". There are languages where the name don't mean anything.
[23:16:01] <mountain> s/name/names/
[23:16:01] <tinsoldier> m​ountain meant: raccoon_dog: No, there too it could be thought of "the language from France". There are languages where the names don't mean anything.
[23:16:15] <raccoon_dog> Well, sure, the word "French" is 'overloaded' -- it has more than one meaning (polysemy.)
[23:17:01] <raccoon_dog> Hm, I'm trying think of examples of that. 
[23:17:25] <mountain> raccoon_dog: Urdu means "horde" in Turkish.
[23:17:44] <mountain> raccoon_dog: I'm probably wrong. It actually was spoken in the army camps.
[23:17:57] <twb> "Spanish language" is usually taken to mean any dialect of Modern Spanish and not e.g. Ladino
[23:18:12] <mountain> raccoon_dog: Every language name would be at least tangentially related to people or place, I suppose.
[23:18:14] <twb> (i.e. raccoon_dog is right)
[23:18:33] <raccoon_dog> I see. I don't know the etymology of the word "Urdu," but I do know that, along with Hindi, it's considered Hindustani, a specific language separated by writing system, but otherwise mutually intelligible.
[23:18:41] <mountain> twb: The point was, if that's true, why isn't "language" capitalised. 
[23:19:02] <mountain> raccoon_dog: It could be considered a different language.
[23:19:04] <raccoon_dog> Because "German" is the name of the language. Unlike "Hudson River," where "River" is part of the explicit name.
[23:19:07] <twb> raccoon_dog: MOSTLY mutually intelligible.  Vocabulary is stolen from different languages
[23:19:23] <raccoon_dog> twb: Yeah, I guess there are some differences.
[23:19:25] <twb> mountain: 04:43 <twb> the name of the language is "German" not "German Language" 04:43 <twb> "What is your native tongue?"  "It is German."
[23:19:44] <mountain> twb: I know you posted that.
[23:19:55] <twb> mountain: well that answer is still the answer
[23:20:00] <raccoon_dog> mountain: Yeah, I do think linguists dispute that, that is true.
[23:20:01] <twb> mountain: it hasn't changed in the last ten minutes
[23:20:05] <raccoon_dog> (Re: Hindi and Urdu.)
[23:20:38] <twb> raccoon_dog: AFAIK that's because linguists look at the language and native speakers look at atrocities >_>
[23:20:44] <raccoon_dog> Heh, yeah.
[23:20:45] <mountain> twb: This question is not dependent on "language" per se. It probably applies in many different contexts where that reasoning doesn't work.
[23:20:54] <twb> mountain: find another example then
[23:21:10] <mountain> twb: I did.
[23:21:26] <twb> mountain: sorry, I don't see it
[23:22:05] <mountain> twb: That was the "Hudson River" example. People would say "Hudson River" is one proper noun. I thought that same reasoning should declare "German Language" to be one proper noun.
[23:22:18] <mdogg> It is not.
[23:22:55] <mdogg> Hudson River is the full name of the river.  German (or English) are the full names of the languages.
[23:23:01] <mountain> Never mind. These kinds of questions won't get resolved anyhow. I don't even follow grammatical rules in my writing generally. I don't know why I asked that.
[23:23:18] <mountain> mdogg: You are back where twb was.
[23:23:19] <mdogg> Well, they are resolved...
[23:23:22] <raccoon_dog> ????
[23:23:34] <raccoon_dog> mountain: mdogg gave the same answer as twb because, well, that is the answer.
[23:23:40] <raccoon_dog> All three of us told you the one same thing.
[23:24:06] <twb> mountain: I meant an example other than language and toponyms, which were both answered already
[23:24:48] <mdogg> mountain: Read the first sentence in this article.  "The German language..."  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language
[23:25:48] <mountain> mdogg: Any example I find where "<name> <common noun>" where <name> and <common noun> is both capitalised, you would proclaim that it's part of the noun. "Hudson River". "Lincoln County". "Choctow Nation". "Indian Ocean". But no, "German Language" is not a proper noun. It's somehow special because it refers to "a language from Germany...". It's not resolved, neither do I wish to resolve it. I would use 
[23:25:55] <mountain> it my way. Sorry, I asked.
[23:26:36] <raccoon_dog> Well, more specifically it means "the language that is known as German." "The German language" is a short way of saying that.
[23:26:47] <raccoon_dog> "German" per se is the full name of the language.
[23:26:57] <mdogg> Because your examples are not Name/Common Noun.  They are names period.
[23:27:01] <raccoon_dog> ^
[23:27:11] <mountain> raccoon_dog: Isn't "Hudson River" also "the river which is known as Hudson"?
[23:27:37] <mdogg> Yes.  But the complete name for that river is the Hudson River.
[23:27:40] <raccoon_dog> Well, strictly speaking you would need to say "the river which is known as the Hudson River," but people may leave out the second "River," since it's clear what is meant.
[23:27:48] <raccoon_dog> But the full correct name is "Hudson River."
[23:29:12] <mountain> raccoon_dog: You know you are wrong. Why do people say, I'm sailing along Thames, then? Only common nouns like city is part of name in words like "New York City". Is there any authority on this or you are just making it up?
[23:29:34] <raccoon_dog> Because it's clear what is meant. /Officially/, the name of that river is the River Thames.
[23:30:13] <raccoon_dog> You're confusing what is commonly said by native speakers since it is clear what is meant versus what the /official/ name of a place/region/body of water/language is.
[23:30:29] <mountain> raccoon_dog: *Officially*, are you suggesting Thames did not have a name till it was written down by some bureaucrat in England?
[23:30:50] <mountain> raccoon_dog: Official has no meaning in this context. There is no authority.
[23:31:10] <raccoon_dog> I don't know who named it or when it was named, but a cursory Internet search suggests that's what it's called. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:31:39] <mountain> raccoon_dog: Internet is your authority, then. That's the whole of the argument. I see. As I said, it's a mistake I asked.
[23:31:41] <twb> *The* Thames
[23:31:49] <mdogg> He isn't making this up.  You said earlier that you don't usually follow grammatical rules - whether you do or not is up to you, but in English the complete name of something is always capitalized.  
[23:32:34] <raccoon_dog> ... You came to IRC to ask people a question, and then turn around and blame *us* for using the Internet? What?
[23:32:40] <mountain> mdogg: I say if "Hudson River" is a complete name, then "German Language" is a complete name too. "Hudson" and "German" are equally ambigious.
[23:32:56] <mountain> raccoon_dog: I made the mistake of thinking you people actually knew English. Sorry.
[23:32:57] <mdogg> mountain: "German language" is not a compete name.
[23:33:09] <mdogg> The name of the language is "German"  Not German language.
[23:33:11] <raccoon_dog> I would propose we stop engaging at this point.
[23:33:32] <twb> mountain: look the bottom line is: you're wrong.  You don't have to believe us, and our reasoning might be bogus, but we're all pretty confident on native speakers what's right and what's wrong
[23:33:43] <twb> *as native speakers
[23:33:45] <mountain> mdogg: You just nulled my point by stating it's contradiction. That's a *brilliant* strategy. Here is my retort, "I'm right".
[23:33:58] <mdogg> Ok.  Great.
[23:34:14] <twb> Also: English rules don't have to make sense
[23:34:38] <mountain> twb: Oh, you are a native speaker so that makes you an authority. Bye, bye.
[23:34:45] <raccoon_dog> ...
[23:35:07] <mdogg> mountain: You should update that Wiki article I sent you earlier and capitalize the word "language".  Perhaps they will provide you with more information when they reject your edit.
[23:35:45] <mountain> mdogg: Wikipedia has tremendous amount of grammatical and punctuation mistake. That's not an authority on anything.

[23:40:17] <mdogg> American Sign Language is the complete name for ASL, which is why language is capitalized.

[23:41:42] <twb> mountain: fix it, then
[23:41:45] <raccoon_dog> Then edit it.
[23:41:50] <mdogg> twb: They sure do.  Because their full name includes the word 'language', thus it is capitalized.  However, when referring to "the English language", English is the complete name of the language.  
[23:41:56] <raccoon_dog> And when your edit is rejected, maybe you can explain to them why you're right.
[23:42:00] <twb> raccoon_dog: agreed

[23:45:21] <mountain> mdogg: Writing is grammatically correct, but it is in these capitalisation cases that I have seen so much ambiguity that makes me think either the rules are not there or there is no consensus or the rules are not well-known.
[23:46:53] <mdogg> We have all explained the rule regarding proper nouns.  You are the one who is trying to make language a proper noun when, is it is not - at least when referring to English, German, Arabic, Spanish, and many others.
[23:47:19] <raccoon_dog> The rule is simple: if the word is part of the name, it is capitalized ("Hudson River.") If it is a descriptor added to the noun ("The German language"), it is not capitalized. I don't know why you're raising such a ruckus over something like this.
[23:47:39] <mdogg> But as twb pointed out, in the "American Sign Language", 'language' is a proper noun because that is the full name.

[23:52:05] <mountain> raccoon_dog: I see "German Language" as one name which refers to *one* language which is standardised. It sure came to be from the phrase "language spoken in Germany" in the past probably. I certainly know that "German cuisine" won't be capitalised because it's not a proper name to me. But "German Language"? I feel it's a proper name. It's a good thing English has no central authority or I would have 
[23:52:11] <mountain> been sent to the gallows long ago by bureaucrats, people who close perfectly good questions on StackOverflow.
