[16:24:36] <tmkt> Is it possible to throttle ffmpeg? I'm taking very mp4 files and transcoding them to a "live" hls stream, but on some files ffmpeg is processing the file to quickly sometimes and the user ends up missing some of the segments
[16:40:24] <hyrcanus> stream should serve up correct timing

[18:06:29] <haasn> bartzy: *
[18:06:46] <haasn> bartzy: anyway in practice the heuristic goes something like this
[18:07:04] <haasn> is it an SD source? if so assume bt.601, choose between ntsc and pal based on a combination of linesize and framerate
[18:07:10] <haasn> is it an HD source? assume bt.709
[18:07:20] <haasn> is it a 4K file? assume bt.709 unless tagging says bt.2020 or it seems incredibly desaturated
[18:07:34] <haasn> bt.2020-cl doesn't exist, only bt.2020-ncl
[18:07:55] <haasn> if it looks very dull and matte and seems to only span a very limited range of colors, assume bt.2020/pq
[18:08:03] <haasn> hlg doesn't exist unless tagged
[18:08:30] <haasn> if it still looks wrong and the color channels are swapped (e.g. red looks green) assume dolbyvision profile 5 and despair
[18:08:35] <haasn> that's the end of the flowchart
[18:08:52] <haasn> everything else doesn't exist

[19:58:26] <bartzy> @haasn thanks. My issue is that for example AE 2018 and below had issues where with H264 exports, it said something is BT709 but the pixel values it used were BT601 (for HD..).
[19:58:32] <slavicupnp1> is -vtag hvc1 a necessary parameter when encoding a video to x265? i have a wmv file that i wanted to switch to x265 with mp4 container
[19:59:01] <JEEB> slavicupnp1: only if you want to play it with QuickTime
[19:59:06] <bartzy> haasn: so when I get a video like that (literal example I had just now), I'm trying to understand if I have anyway of somehow checking frames/pixel values to try to understand if it's really BT709 or this weird BT601
[19:59:47] <slavicupnp1> quicktime 😂

[20:07:54] <bartzy> JEEB: I'm trying to remember your remarks about BT.1886 and if/how to use it in ffmpeg
[20:08:08] <bartzy> I really need to stop using this webclient
[20:13:17] <slavicupnp1> sucks when support rooms don't have archives
[20:18:25] <haasn> bartzy: none except comparing against reference
[20:18:31] <haasn> bt.709 and bt.601 are extremely similar
[20:18:43] <haasn> so it basically amounts to figuring out which shade of green/red is more appropriate to the scene
[20:18:49] <haasn> something you can't really do without prior knowledge of the scene
[20:19:02] <haasn> there's no obvious test because they all map e.g. gray to the same thing (neutral)
[20:19:32] <haasn> bt.709/bt.601 mixups are unfortunately a reality and probably the most common mixup out there
[20:19:52] <haasn> mpv to this day has built-in work-arounds to correct a bt.601 mixup in aegisub

[20:33:02] <GKR> Hey folks. I'm new to the whole concept of IRC and open source contributing
[20:33:06] <GKR> Came looking for tips
[20:33:19] <GKR> Any help is appreciated
[20:33:27] <JEEB> just ask and you might get a response
[20:33:46] <kepstin> GKR: asking specific, detailed questions is a good way to get useful answers
[20:34:19] <kepstin> there we go, that's my tip :)
[20:34:32] <GKR> Been using ffmpeg for long time. Would like to contribute. How can I get started. I read all the guides from ffmpeg.org
[20:34:59] <GKR> I'm fluent in C and C++
[20:35:00] <JEEB> first of all clone the git repo, then build master
[20:35:07] <bartzy> slavicupnp1: Like you chose a codec for your video, you need to choose a codec for you audio and not just do `-c:a copy`, since as kepstin said you can't just put windows media audio in mp4.
[20:35:28] <JEEB> the problem is what is your pet peeve
[20:35:30] <JEEB> what you would like to poke at
[20:35:34] <bartzy> see https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/HighQualityAudio for some options
[20:35:40] <kepstin> GKR: imo, the best way to contribute is to find some problem in ffmpeg that you've personally hit, and learn how to solve that problem.
[20:35:59] <kepstin> that's how all my contributions happened, more or less :)
[20:36:07] <JEEB> https://www.ffmpeg.org/developer.html and https://www.ffmpeg.org/fate.html and relevant
[20:36:08] <slavicupnp1> so the command was fine, outside of not changing the audio format? bartzy
[20:36:11] <GKR> JEEB AMF has been bothering me for sometime. Would like to start there honestly 😅
[20:36:21] <JEEB> the hardware stuff? oof
[20:36:32] <JEEB> welcome to the stuff that has not so many reviewers most likely :)
[20:36:45] <JEEB> not that various software-only things have a lot of reviewers, o' course
[20:36:46] <bartzy> slavicupnp1: seems like it, if that's what you wanted to do. try it and see
[20:36:51] <JEEB> but hey
[20:37:07] <JEEB> if it's something that can be improved you can give it a poke
[20:37:12] <JEEB> at the very least you'll get experience
[20:37:22] <JEEB> check what the dependencies for AMF are, build master FFmpeg with it
[20:37:33] <JEEB> at that point you have master built what you are planning to poke at
[20:38:43] <GKR> tbh idk much 😂 i just dropped something of the top of my head
[20:38:56] <GKR> Maybe bug fixes
[20:39:01] <GKR> Heard thats a good place to start
[20:39:50] <JEEB> usually it's something that a person cares about
[20:40:07] <JEEB> a la "I fixed VC-1 decoding because my Starcraft streams were broken""
