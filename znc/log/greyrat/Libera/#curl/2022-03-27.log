[20:52:09] <kop316> Hello! I have what seems to be an unusual question. I am attempting to use libcurl to connect to an IMAP server, and the IMAP server is misconfigured in the sense that it does not advertise PLAIN authentication over IMAPS. Because of this, libcurl thinks it cannot use PLAIN authentication. I independently confirmed that PLAIN authentication does work. Is there a way to tell libcurl to ignore the capabilities and use PLAIN authentication?
