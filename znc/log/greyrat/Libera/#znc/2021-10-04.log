[03:33:23] <tar_xvf> The lets encrypt DST Root CA X3 root certificate expired a few days ago. That might lead to your cert not being accepted

[13:19:08] <neverwas> Hi, anyone ever encounter a "Bad cert" and "SockError(12569 Invalid SSL certificate: certificate has expired)" message for a public network with a valid DV cert, in my case OFTC?
[13:19:23] <neverwas> I'm running the official alpine container with one unofficial plugin called ident server. I also checked the cert store/bundle with openssl and verified that the certificate chain was valid. So I don't think it's the environment.
[13:19:57] <neverwas> My instance actually crashed a couple times while this was going on. So I've since turned off autoconnect for the two affected networks.
[13:21:33] <MetaNova> neverwas: probably repercussions of LE's root cert expiring
[13:22:17] <MetaNova> yesterday there was someone who was having trouble connecting to a network in ZNC 1.7.4, but openssl s_client -connect verified the cert was fine
[13:24:31] <neverwas> Hi MetaNova. Wait, re root cert expiring: so that definitely happened then? If so, I guess I can breath a sigh of relief. (right?)
[13:25:08] <MetaNova> you can rest assured it's likely not something /you/ did, specifically, yes
[13:25:20] <neverwas> Ah, nice. Just for good measure, any chance you're willing to glance at some logs for 30 secs? (Doesn't have to be now.)

[13:37:54] <MetaNova> neverwas: unfortunately I don't have much insight re: the logs, besides making sure your system is up to date
[13:38:26] <MetaNova> if it continues, a stopgap measure might be to simply accept invalid certificates
[13:40:41] <mgedmin> perhaps a safer measure would be to accept the fingerprint of this particular certificate, once you've verified that it's good via other means (like your openssl s_client -connect)
[13:41:13] <mgedmin> it's interesting that openssl s_client accepts the cert, because AFAIK the issue with LE's expired root cert is a bug in openssl 1.0.x
[13:41:40] <MetaNova> <=1.0.2
[13:41:52] <neverwas> Thanks mgedmin, I've gone ahead and added those fingerprints, since I've verified them by hand. Guess it was just the crash I found a bit disconcerting. But I did just upgrade the ca-certificates package. So I'll restart and see if anything changes. If so, I'll report back. Thanks for the help MetaNova.
[13:42:02] <mgedmin> ah!  I thought it was <=1.1.0, but I must've misremembered
[13:42:21] <MetaNova> all versions of 1.0.2 (and older) are affected
[13:42:32] <MetaNova> anything newer than 1.0.2 "should be fine"
[13:42:39] <mgedmin> welp, I meant I thought <1.1.0
[13:42:43] <mgedmin> was there ever a 1.0.3?
[13:42:55] <MetaNova> AFAIK, no, just a bunch of different revisions to 1.0.2
[13:43:02] <MetaNova> like 1.0.2k and such
[13:44:10] <MetaNova> neverwas: your system isn't using openssl 1.0.2 is it?
[13:45:08] <neverwas> 1.1.1l I guess
[13:45:16] <MetaNova> okay, just checking
[13:45:29] <knolle> neverwas: the docker image was changed from libressl to openssl 3 days ago, which fixes it
[13:45:53] <knolle> might need to pull that again though
[13:46:12] <Linux^> okay so here is the current build config, can you check if its ok? https://i.postimg.cc/bNtp9LBh/image.png
[13:46:44] <neverwas> oh, no way! I'll just pull the new one instead. thanks knolle.
[13:47:01] <Linux^> how can I enable python though?
[13:47:04] <MetaNova> Linux^: looks good
[13:47:06] <MetaNova> oh
[13:47:09] <Linux^> python 3 is installed
[13:47:18] <MetaNova> if you want python support, python3-dev needs to be installed
[13:47:36] <Linux^> okay will it be helpful to have python enabled?
[13:48:00] <knolle> if you want python scripts, yes. if you don't, no.
[13:48:03] <MetaNova> that depends. do you have intentions on running any scripts in ZNC written in python?
[13:48:15] <Linux^> nope
[13:48:18] <MetaNova> then no
[13:48:45] <Linux^> modules can be written in python?
[13:48:50] *** Joins: Kaya (~KC@static.89.202.216.95.clients.your-server.de)
[13:49:31] <MetaNova> modpython is a module, my_first_script.py (placed in ~/.znc/modules/ like the other third-party modules) is written in python
[13:49:40] <MetaNova> in effect, sure

[13:59:07] <Linux^> python3-dev is already the newest version (3.8.2-0ubuntu2).
[13:59:16] <Linux^> it is already installed
[14:00:07] <MetaNova> okay, when you run ./configure, feed it --with-python
[14:00:15] <MetaNova> see if "python: yes" results from that
[14:00:18] <Linux^> okay
[14:02:12] <Linux^> cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local" --with-python ?
[14:04:21] <MetaNova> um
[14:04:35] <Linux^> no its not its not working
[14:04:47] <MetaNova> the actual cmake argument is -DWANT_PYTHON=yes I think
[14:05:02] <MetaNova> not sure why you're doing it the hard way, configure is a nice cmake wrapper
[14:05:24] <Linux^> I was following this https://wiki.znc.in/Installation
[14:05:36] <MetaNova> ah, well
[14:05:43] <MetaNova> see what ./configure --help shows
[14:05:48] <MetaNova> (much easier)

[14:06:02] <ZNC-Linker> MetaNova meant: “that wiki entry could use some updating”
[14:08:41] <Linux^> okay I dont need python. So I have one last question. How can I get the favicons also showing with znc connection?
[14:09:17] <Linux^> Libera has favicon that shows normally in my irn client server tab
[14:09:23] <Linux^> irc*
[14:12:12] <MetaNova> this is the first I've heard of IRC networks/clients having favicons
[14:13:46] <DarthGandalf> That must be your client comparing server name with libera.chat and if matches, showing that icon
[14:13:49] <Linux^> okay I am posting a screenshot
[14:13:52] <DarthGandalf> libera itself doesn't send anything
[14:17:14] <Linux^> Okay here you can see the 2 servers left side has favicon(without znc) but the moment I connect them using znc it doesnt show it https://i.postimg.cc/JzPQpw0D/image.png
[14:17:24] <Linux^> sorry right side*
[14:18:07] <DarthGandalf> what client is this?
[14:18:24] <Linux^> Its not exclusive to my client. I am using Adiirc
[14:19:05] <DarthGandalf> https://dev.adiirc.com/projects/adiirc/wiki/Icons_Options#Get-favicon-from-server-website
[14:19:27] <DarthGandalf> It is exclusive to your client
[14:20:02] <Linux^> nah I have seen other clients also mirc
[14:21:00] <Linux^> also chatzilla can show it
[14:21:17] <DarthGandalf> Since your "ZNC website" (I don't know how your client figures it out where to connect to for the favicon) doesn't return the Libera favicon, the client doesn't show it
[14:23:07] <Linux^> So there is no module which can show it. I see
[14:23:40] <knolle> you would have to have a webserver running on the same box

[15:14:09] <Linux^> Whatever I dont need to know anyway,  znc is now working with ssl , I dont want to poke around,  . thanks for the help
[15:17:45] <MetaNova> Linux^: I believe charset supports IRC networks with less-common character encodings set
[15:18:14] <MetaNova> which is primarily (exclusively?) non-English/non-UTF networks
[15:18:16] <Linux^> ☘💙💚 < these things/
[15:18:28] <MetaNova> not exactly
[15:19:08] <MetaNova> (admittedly I'm not an expert) but I think charset is for, like, CP1256 (Arabic)
[15:19:50] <MetaNova> which I think affects (again, I'm not an expert) how each character byte is formatted
[15:20:02] <MetaNova> if you /needed/ charset, you'd know it, I think
[15:20:09] <Linux^> yeah
[15:20:10] <MetaNova> since messages would be malformatted otherwise
[15:21:44] <MetaNova> for my personal instance I have no use for it
[15:22:08] <MetaNova> just like I have no need for translation/i18n support
[15:22:21] <MetaNova> but for the instances I deploy publicly, I be sure to include those, just in case
