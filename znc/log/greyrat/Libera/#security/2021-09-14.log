[04:53:33] <supps[m]> has anyone ever been able to create a google account on tor with phone number verification? I don't want anyone to ever pay google to trace my identity and a lot of content publishing websites require gmail accounts. I feel locked out and frustrated. Is your only option to pay some chad in a random country some cash to buy a burner?
[04:54:32] <supps[m]> I know they make you use phone numbers to "prevent bots" which their effing capchas do very effectively, but man, they'll give up your phone number given the right incentives.
[04:55:43] <supps[m]> additionally they're effective at spotting burners these days. I was wondering if there was a way to spin up a legit phone number online without paying anyone money, and also not revealing your identity
[04:56:10] *** Joins: pmercado (~pmercado@186.107.55.118)
[04:58:30] <nsx> nah you can't do that
[04:59:28] <supps[m]> ok, follow up, is paying for stuff online with bitcoin over tor truly untraceable?
[04:59:41] <Hash> No
[04:59:54] <Hash> That's not the goal of bitcoin
[05:00:06] <nsx> not at all, there are privacy focused coins for that
[05:00:09] <Hash> Anonymity and untraceableness was never it's feature
[05:00:33] <supps[m]> so you'd have to exchange the privacy focused coin for bitcoin then?
[05:01:08] <nsx> you can deposit privacy coins on most exchanges and exchange them for fiat
[05:01:08] <supps[m]> coz man, call me a conspiracy theorist but I don't want my publisher to know who I am lol but I still want to be paid for my work
[05:01:38] <nsx> i could get you a sim card and mail it to you if you cover the costs
[05:01:42] <supps[m]> he was ok paying me in bitcoin so I'll have to ask him to do the privacy coin instead

[05:02:02] <supps[m]> nah the phone number thing was a general question its just infuriating
[05:02:05] <nsx> well you can always convert btc to something else yourself
[05:02:07] <Hydragyrum> btc isn't really traceable to a real person -- but it's traceable to your btc wallet
[05:02:11] <nsx> if it's a hassle for him
[05:02:45] <nsx> or you could use samurai wallet if you want to keep btc anonymously
[05:02:49] <supps[m]> like all I wanna do is cuck google lol
[05:03:36] <Hydragyrum> so you could get paid in btc to a wallet which you keep anonymous, and then do anything from buying a privacycoin and transferring that coin to yourself, to using a btc laundering service

[05:08:17] <Hydragyrum> it's possible that all those exit nodes have been (ab)used in the past and specifically blocked (i.e. by something like fail2ban)
[05:08:23] <supps[m]> but I'm assuming new ones pop up every day, and I think if I kept refreshing and got a random exit node that they hadn't blocked, I'd be able to create an account. they track your IP and I'm super against that on principle
[05:09:19] <supps[m]> its sad that scammers and spammers use the same techniques to avoid identity leaks as legit people who want their identity secret

[21:38:15] <Hash> When you decompile in ghidra, you get generated code which is generic.
[21:38:33] <Hash> You need to go through it, find the main function, follow it through, find other methods, see who takes what kinds of arguments
[21:38:42] <Hash> You need to study that. No one can study that for you.
[21:39:04] <dodo> Hash: didn't you say you'd stop talking to them?
[21:39:05] <Hash> Like I said before, go through the decompiled code and start writing identifier first so the code makes sense.
[21:39:28] <Hash> I'm not addressing him. I'm talking to the general 'you'. The all encompassing.
[21:39:48] <dodo> something bothering you today? everything alright?
[21:39:58] <Hash> But if someone else is more helpful, please go on help him. We're all watching.

[21:57:33] <Hydragyrum> personally I prefer retdec-decompiler, partly because I used it before ghidra came out -- but it's really easy to use and I haven't really gotten ghidra to work well (all that ugly java/eclipse stuff)

[22:08:21] <Hash> Nice
[22:08:47] <Hash> Ghidra is trivially easy to use. It's not the features/functions of the software or the software that's confusing at all.
[22:09:05] <Hash> You can't do much with this software at all if you have 'no idea' about reverseengineering
[22:09:34] <Hash> You can't do much if you say, "I'm not sure if I want to spend time reading about how to use it or do things"
[22:10:03] <Hash> If you know how reverse engineering works, the principals, the theory, you can then put it into practice in any decompiler etc.
[22:10:13] <Hash> Software isn't what limits you, it's your own gnosis.
[22:10:17] <Hash> or lack of it.
[22:10:38] <Hash> Guy comes in, wants to do something, has no idea how, and refuses to want to read.
[22:11:23] <Hash> There isn't much you can do for such a person. Even then, you do you best to try and help and point them in the direction to do their own work. But like he said, he wasn't sure if he wants to spend time reading. I said come back when you're sure, because only then can we help you.
[22:11:51] *** Joins: beanbag- (~bogjumper@96-94-103-85-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net)
[22:12:09] <beanbag-> what do sql injection attacks look like in event viewer if they leave any clues?
[22:12:32] <Hash> Good question. They would mostly likely (I've not used a MS windows SQL server) show up as failed queries?
[22:12:48] <Hash> Because injection attacks run through a list of strings to input into SQL
[22:12:59] <Hash> Lot of them will fail to launch a query
[22:13:12] <Hash> If server is configured to record/log failed queries, then yes you can know.
[22:13:23] <Hash> Otherwise, I'm unsure. I'm only guessing off the top of my head.

[22:18:28] <beanbag-> thx

[22:18:43] <beanbag-> I don't think it's probably an attack it's just a config error it looks like

[22:19:45] <mats1> this link doesnt have anything to do with event viewer
[22:20:04] <Hash> I dont think the title ever claimed that.
[22:21:34] <mats1> googling keywords in a question and sharing links without reading them is a lazy way to not help anyone while creating the appearance of being helpful
[22:21:43] <Hash> I did read it.
[22:22:40] <mats1> fortunately beanbag- is a nice guy
[22:23:04] <Hash> https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/sql-server/database-administration-sql-server/getting-started-with-extended-events-in-sql-server-2012/ <- linked literally in the actual article if you read.

[22:23:25] <Hydragyrum> mats1, hash already said he didn't know a ton about it, finding appropriate links can still be helpful
[22:23:26] <Hash> But you actually have to read.
[22:24:04] <Hash> Hydragyrum: another regular antagonistic troll. I wouldn't bother.
[22:24:17] <Hydragyrum> fair enough
[22:24:57] <Hash> OWASP theory article is linked. Guide to setting up events in SQL serer is linked. General throgy and guide of how to detect and what to loo for is there.
[22:25:07] <Hash> How exactly is that article (the first one I linked) unhelpful?
[22:25:48] <Hash> See what I mean? There are a couple of people here who are mean, who just don't like someone, and they take EVERY SINGLE OPPORTUNITY to publicly show up them or challenge them and be antagonistic.

[22:29:37] <Hash> How can you be hateful, mean, antagonistic and use the channel to troll me daily without blinking?
[22:32:37] <beanbag-> mats1, it's ok I know hash, he meant well
[22:33:26] <beanbag-> I know squat about sql anyways I am just seeing a lot of event viewer entries and for a moment I wondered if mabye it was being dicked with
[22:33:38] <beanbag-> but looks like this has been going on for a long time I doubt it's an attack
[22:33:59] <Hash> beanbag-: some people in the history of #security like mats1 have never actually helped people. They are here simply for their own entertainment. I wouldn't pay them any mind.
[22:35:03] <Hash> If they actually contributed to the development of a community here and helped people, I might think of them as slightly important or worry about what they have to say. Mostly it is just them whining about this political thing or that, offtopic conversations, I've yet to witness mats1 (since libera security has been here) help anyone.
[22:35:10] <Hash> *shrug* nothing to worry about.
[22:36:16] <Hash> beanbag-: you can always analyze the logs to see. Shouldn't take long and you'd get an idea
[22:36:23] <Hash> There are sql log auditing tools as well
[22:36:57] <Hash> Best thing to detect is to learn how to setup event monitoring as described in those links, and if those links are insuffient, it hsould give you enough material to start looking in the right direction
[22:37:05] <Hash> As always, Hash is here to assist.
[22:37:07] <Hash> :)
[22:38:57] <Hash> Windows tools so far seem to not be free and cost money, no foss solutions yet so far.
