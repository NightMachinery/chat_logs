[07:59:37] <roarde> lord_daemon: Is the original data coming from a database (CSV, etc, included) of some sort, or a flat text listing?
[08:00:23] <roarde> I'm thinking you may want this by fields which aren't necessarily separated by spaces.
[08:00:33] <roarde> How should the output be formatted?
[08:03:15] <lord_daemon> it's a txt. the fields have no pattern so I need to print up to two words: Ampla and Negros
[08:03:32] <lord_daemon> is it possible in awk?

[08:04:01] <roarde> I had it, then you said "or Negros". Hang on.
[08:04:48] <lord_daemon> I lost my document with some examples I kept from the channel :(
[08:06:01] <roarde> Those lines are missing what I take to be a catalog-entry which your first example had; "12AERT121" there.
[08:06:22] <roarde> Is it just present on some lines, but not on others?
[08:08:02] <lord_daemon> the pattern changes, but all lines have the word Ampla or Negros
[08:08:18] <lord_daemon> That's why I need to print for them

[08:08:43] <roarde> got it
[08:15:14] <roarde> | awk 'sub(/ +(Ampla|Negros).*$/, "", $0) { print $0 }'
[08:16:44] <roarde> There's a way to do it be iterating through each substring, but that would have to be applied back to the original format for this to make sense, so may as well alter the whole string, up front.
[08:19:18] <roarde> The text being aligned by fields, there's another way to handle it by splitting on index.
[08:20:26] <roarde> That way, it could be sucked into a CSV or such, then formatted on its way back out.
[08:21:37] <lord_daemon> awk 'sub(/ +(Ampla).*$/, "", $0) { print $0 }' lista.txt 
[08:21:41] <lord_daemon> no worked
[08:21:42] <roarde> If you just want to print the list and you're real sure all the lines have Ampla|Negros in the right place, just go with the abpove
[08:22:29] <lord_daemon> yes I'm sure, all lines have Ampla or Negros
[08:22:37] <roarde> It should have printed only the "Ampla" lines.
[08:24:11] <roarde> because (Ampla) rather than (Ampla|Negros)
[08:24:20] <roarde> Is that what you got?
[08:24:57] <lord_daemon> yep
[08:25:00] <lord_daemon> Ampla|Negros
[08:25:13] <roarde> What did it print, roughly?
[08:25:38] <lord_daemon>  awk 'sub(/ +(Ampla|Negros).*$/, "", $0) { print $0 }' lista.txt
[08:25:40] <lord_daemon> no worked

[08:43:21] <roarde> Or wait. We may have DOS line-endings. Would that matter? I honestly don't know.
[08:43:31] <lord_daemon> for example really the regex is right then. I'm testing in termux
[08:43:47] <lord_daemon> I will turn on the CentOS. just a moment
[08:44:25] <roarde> Termux is busybox?
[08:45:17] <nmz> whats happening here?

[08:45:52] <nmz> you telling me?
[08:46:10] <nmz> if you got that working congrats
[08:46:23] <roarde> In termux, "which awk"
[08:46:43] <nmz> theres no awk in termux?
[08:47:01] <roarde> Earlier ones, no awk.
[08:47:19] <roarde> Installable, of course.
[08:47:22] <lord_daemon> termux has sed perl grep php python awk ...
[08:48:07] <nmz> sure
[08:49:21] <lord_daemon> people at centos worked. sorry. thanks
[08:49:58] <roarde> I'm interested in just which awk your termux has. Not that it's your job to report it :P
[08:50:47] <nmz> mine is at /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/awk
[08:51:56] <lord_daemon> kkkkkkkkkk
[08:52:13] <lord_daemon> nmz, yep
[08:53:26] <nmz> if its a phone you can move to gdrive then just get share link and then and then and then
[08:54:35] <lord_daemon> a guess. let's say that in the middle of the file there is one that has neither "AMPLA" nor "Negros", how to make awk display this line instead of disregarding it?
[08:54:54] <roarde> Move the curly brace.
[08:55:27] <roarde> awk '{ sub(/ +(Ampla|Negros).*$/, "", $0); print $0 }'
[08:56:05] <lord_daemon> roarde, great
[08:56:22] <lord_daemon> I love termux, I'm good for studying
[08:56:24] <roarde> The default expression (before the brace) is "true".
[08:57:08] <nmz> hmm, I wonder if I can run sshd from termux and just treat it like a small server
[08:58:41] <lord_daemon> I run sshd here
[08:58:43] <lord_daemon> crontab
[08:59:23] <lord_daemon> sshd only allows to set password, not user
[08:59:43] <lord_daemon> ftp server does not allow creating username and password
[08:59:45] <lord_daemon> :}
[09:00:45] <lord_daemon> still allows window manager, i ran fluxbox and openbox
