[00:17:00] <redbrass> Git related question - but not git specific.  I need to generate a changelog based on git commit messages.  But I need to summarize the changes for the main project AND a number of releated (but still independent) projects.
[00:17:37] <redbrass> I'm sure someone has created a tool for this sort of thing - much like the automated changelog solutions out there - but those all seem to only deal with a single project.
[00:18:19] <redbrass> I've begun writing such a tool, it is nagging at me that I'm reinventing the wheel here...
[00:19:22] <imMute> redbrass: how is the parent project "tied" to the other projects?  submodules?
[00:19:40] <redbrass> imMute: no submodules.  More of a meta project thing.
[00:19:52] <imMute> explain in git terms please.
[00:20:49] *** Joins: DoofusCanadensis (~DoofusCan@207.229.38.10)
[00:21:54] <redbrass> Git project "myproject" depends on the output from a number of other in house git projects.  There is no direct git sub project setup.  Basically imagine a Bash script that generates an installation ISO, that includes a number of customized *.deb packages for our system.

[00:22:45] *** Joins: Codaraxis (~Codaraxis@user/codaraxis)
[00:23:24] <redbrass> each of the deb packages are treated as a separate git project.  The deb packaging has it's own changelog system per project.  The "myproject" code needs a changelog that summarizes ALL changes that went into the ISO.
[00:24:05] <redbrass> It is a little confusing mixing/matching git terms and deb terms...  But in practice they are completely independent/isoloate git projects.
[00:24:16] <redbrass> *isolated
[00:24:25] <imMute> ah, so the info of "which SHA to build" for each of the sub projects is stored in that script.   so yeah, you're probably gonna have to write your own thing.  can probably reuse existing tooling to generate the per-project changelogs though
[00:25:21] <redbrass> Writing a custom per-project changelog is very straight forward - dump git logs, filter the output, run that through a template engine.
[00:26:31] <redbrass> The multi project thing has a lot of gotchas - the projects do not use the same versioning structure, or tag names.  So a tag in the main project has to rely on the date range that tag existed to find "related" commits in the other projects.
[00:27:14] <redbrass> (this is all part of restructuring our projects for an easier workflow, so this logic will likely get a lot easier in the future...)

[00:31:26] <humanface> what the hell is happening on Github?
[00:31:36] <humanface> what is this new personal access token?
[00:31:45] <humanface> how to set that into Sourcetree?
[00:32:39] <imMute> humanface: the PAT is for authenticating when using HTTPS remotes.
[00:32:44] <humanface> ok
[00:32:47] <humanface> how to use it?
[00:32:58] <humanface> I have already generated one in github
[00:33:03] <humanface> but how to add that to my git?

[00:34:20] <DoofusCanadensis> you'll want to ask in #github
[00:35:20] <humanface> it's like a demon from hell
[00:35:25] <humanface> purge it for me

[00:35:40] <humanface> it says "copy the token and use it as password in your hoster repositories
[00:35:46] <humanface> I mean "wtf did I just read"
[00:35:53] <humanface> where to copy?
[00:36:09] <DoofusCanadensis> well, that's a UI question applicable to github and sourcetree. not git
[00:36:14] <imMute> where sourcetree asks for your username/password.  use the PAT as the password instead of your github password
[00:36:24] <humanface> I see
[00:36:37] <humanface> well, I even struggle with make the sourcetree to ask my password
[00:36:47] <humanface> I purged the whole credential manager in windows

[00:37:32] <humanface> this personal access token monster xd
[00:37:33] <DoofusCanadensis> talk to Atlassian about that
[00:37:51] <DoofusCanadensis> personally, I use SSH with SourceTree and all other Git clients
[00:38:06] <humanface> imMute already were there, I deleted the access from there
[00:38:12] <humanface> but still it stored the password
[00:38:15] <humanface> and not deleted that
[00:38:27] <imMute> humanface: so add your github "acount" back, using your PAT as the password and not the github password
[00:41:16] <humanface> I always hated these kind of technical struggles
[00:41:18] <humanface> like this
[00:41:52] <DoofusCanadensis> why not just SSH?
[00:42:27] <imMute> DoofusCanadensis: you really think he's up for setting up SSH keys if he can't setup a user/PAT ?
[00:42:52] <DoofusCanadensis> good point
[00:42:59] <humanface> imMute I don't know if you're up for discuss these things with me if you can't read
[00:43:05] <humanface> I already setted PAT
[00:43:09] <humanface> I wrote that 3 times in here
[00:43:28] <humanface> I just literally hate to deal with these kind of things
[00:43:31] <humanface> PAT and wtf
[00:43:36] <imMute> okay, I *was* helping you, but now I'm not going to if you're going to have that kind of attitude.
[00:43:51] <DoofusCanadensis> no kidding
[00:44:06] <imMute> like, I understand you're probably mighty frustrated, but we are *volunteers*, so don't be nasty to us.
[00:44:18] <humanface> I'm just saying if every system would be like this, then propably I would not be a developer for sure

[00:58:30] <redbrass> humanface: just catching up on the conversation.  But knowing GIT from the CLI will save you much grief.  Not to mention that sooner or later your repo will get into a weird state and you'll need the more arcane commands to restore it to a good state.
[00:58:52] <redbrass> With that knowledge, the GUI's become just a convenience.
[00:59:04] <DoofusCanadensis> Git... not an acronym

[09:31:25] <sh4> i'm having a repo where i imported some huge binary files in root commit, then i made another commit removing those files and used rebase -i to fixup the root commit with the removal commit, yet the size of .git is still huge, and git gc --prune=now --aggressive doesn't seem to remove the unneeded binary blobs
[09:32:14] <sh4> the size of all patches made with git-format-patch are like 10% of the size of .git
[09:32:36] <sh4> is there a way i can remove the junk other than making a new repo importing those patches ?

[13:50:41] <sh4> i tried pyhon -m SimpleHTTPServer in the root directory of the git repo, but git clone http://...:8000/dir didnt work

[13:51:20] <j416> git clone user@server:/path/to/repo
[13:51:58] <j416> then once you've cloned once, you can fetch new things incrementally using git fetch
[13:52:32] <sh4> oh, i just used the server to do the initial work as it has gbit connection, unlike my home wlan
[13:52:58] <sh4> so the transfer/clone is a one-time job

[19:50:43] <seds> I wonder if git allows adding and commiting specific files without commiting any staged file. I am creating a script to autocommit a specific directory when the directory gets updated. I know I can `git commit <files>` but not on untracked files. Ideas?
[19:56:01] <j416> seds: didn't know that didn't work for untracked files. til.
[19:56:22] <j416> seds: you can specify a separate index file if that helps
[19:57:11] <j416> seds: or you can craft the commit manually but that is probably more of a hassle
[19:57:21] <nedbat> j416: how do you specify a different index file?
[19:57:29] <seds> j416: unfortunatly, it would have made things much easier. How would one separate a different index?
[19:57:33] <j416> nedbat: I don't remember but I know it's possible
[19:57:53] <j416> GIT_INDEX_FILE
[19:58:02] <j416> perhaps there's a different way.
[19:58:16] <seds> split-index ?
[19:58:26] <seds> -> Enable or disable split index mode. If split-index mode is already enabled and --split-index is given again, all changes in $GIT_DIR/index are pushed back to the shared index file.
[19:58:41] <j416> never used

[20:04:35] <seds> yeah
[20:04:51] <seds> doesn't git lock?
[20:05:29] <seds> because the user = me, basically I have a repo with a bunch of personal files and a journal directory, and that is what I want to auto commit

[20:05:53] <j416> as far as corruption etc. goes I think you're safe

[20:06:24] <j416> one for autocommit, one for other things
