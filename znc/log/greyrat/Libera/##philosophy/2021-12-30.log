[00:41:54] <causative_> it's messed up how still with modern technology there is no way, on any device I'm aware of, to automatically adjust the volume to match a target output decibel level
[00:42:24] <causative_> instead constantly having to tweak the volume control when the media is louder or softer than the previous one
[00:43:21] <I_Am_M00t> you can set something custom up on a PC
[00:43:57] <I_Am_M00t> it's a hassle tho
[00:44:14] <causative_> not easily or by default on any platform I know of
[00:45:59] <I_Am_M00t> hence custom, and hassle
[00:49:07] <Ungwelian> The problem is prolly exactly that nowadays everyone uses automatic volume equalization.
[00:49:12] <Ungwelian> I remember reading about this.
[00:49:47] <Ungwelian> What this means, is that there's no point anymore in mixing the sound well beforehand.
[00:51:02] <causative_> I'm not using automatic volume equalization, isn't that a sound production thing not a consumer thing?
[00:51:03] <Ungwelian> One of those cases where new technology leads to lack of quality.
[00:51:51] <Ungwelian> I have an audio card from the Neolithic Age, and it has automatic volume equalization.
[00:52:24] <Ungwelian> 10 years ago, it was still ok to go without it, but nowadays general sound volume is so badly mixed that it's pretty much impossible.
[00:53:02] <causative_> I'm talking about the master system volume and app volume
[00:53:41] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian: hehe, not sure my laptop has automatic normalization
[00:53:49] <I_Am_M00t> if that's what you mean by volume equalization
[00:54:03] <Ungwelian> "Smart Volume Management", my audio card labels it.
[00:54:11] <I_Am_M00t> sounds from different sources vary a lot in volume
[00:54:21] <I_Am_M00t> in max volume
[00:54:33] <Ungwelian> Basically cutting off peaks, losing variety and making everything sound the same :P
[00:54:50] <I_Am_M00t> but i've routed all the sound through a DAW a few times, to get automatic normalization etc
[00:54:57] <causative_> yeah I'm not talking about equalizing specific frequencies
[00:55:01] <causative_> I'm talking about the master system volume and app volume
[00:55:04] <Ungwelian> I'd wager it's also because recording audio at a very low volume prolly takes less space.
[00:55:19] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian: you don't even have to squash the dynamics, sometimes it's enough to automatically gain compensate
[00:56:14] <causative_> so that, for instance, the sound in my headphones should neither be too quiet nor too loud no matter what I'm listening to, without me having to adjust it on a per-app or per-song basis
[00:56:15] <I_Am_M00t> well, you might clip an explosion sound or something, but who cares
[00:56:37] <Ungwelian> causative_, yeah, that's exactly what "smart volume management" does.

[00:56:37] <I_Am_M00t> causative_: that's kind of what Ungwelian is talking about
[00:56:43] <Ungwelian> Yep.
[00:56:55] <causative_> ok well no device I have ever had does this
[00:57:01] <causative_> nor have I ever heard of any device doing it
[00:57:07] <I_Am_M00t> anyway, any PC/laptop can do it, if you feel like setting it up
[00:57:19] <causative_> every device I have had has a manual master volume control
[00:57:53] <Ungwelian> It's a simple button trigger. Of course there's master volume control on top of it.
[00:58:21] <I_Am_M00t> Reaper to the rescue
[00:58:27] <Ungwelian> I wouldn't be surprised if it was automatically done by some modern stuff, without a way to turn it off.
[00:58:50] <causative_> it is a frequent experience that I will have to adjust the master volume control because whatever I'm listening too is too loud or quiet
[00:58:55] <Ungwelian> Basically the same thing as with hard drive space :P
[00:58:57] <causative_> on every device I've ever had
[00:59:07] <I_Am_M00t> lol Ungwelian, my stuff sure doesn't
[00:59:10] <Ungwelian> The bigger the hard drives get, the more twisted the spaghetti code becomes.
[00:59:19] <causative_> this means that whatever you're talking about is not active on those devices
[00:59:26] <causative_> or doesn't do the thing I'm talking about
[00:59:49] <I_Am_M00t> causative_: i don't know how to explain this to you, but any pc can do this, if you just setup the software yourself initially

[01:12:05] <I_Am_M00t> any pc can do it, if you feel like installing some software

[02:06:29] <causative_> I feel like there's plenty of opportunity, and the technical capability, to make useful home robots that could turn switches on/off, carry items from one room to another, feed the pets, provide telepresence
[02:07:48] <causative_> I'd imagine the robot could sidestep the problems of navigating stairs etc, by being able to clamp onto rails and use the rail to get over difficult areas
[02:08:16] <causative_> so you'd bolt special rails designed for the robot in key locations around your home
[02:08:38] <causative_> thinking of something the size of a football
[02:09:53] <causative_> the rails could also go on the ceiling so that they're out of the way, and the robot never leaves the rails, and dangles from a cord to reach the ground
[02:11:23] <amigojapan> causative_: that sounds like a good idea

[02:16:10] *** Joins: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers)
[02:22:38] <causative_> since the robot is restricted to the rails, it can't go everywhere. So you'd set up a "storage area" under a section of rail with items that the robot can pick up to bring elsewhere. And for the robot to carry items back to the storage area, a human needs to hand the item to it
[02:24:53] <causative_> the items the robot carries can either be one of a limited set the robot can grasp unaided, or have a special handle attached to them for the robot to grab
[02:26:34] <amigojapan> causative_: telepresence seems like the best use for a simple form of that robot you suggest
[02:26:48] <causative_> telepresence is also easy and basically solved
[02:26:58] <amigojapan> Yup
[02:27:17] <causative_> but an item-carrying robot is not solved
[02:27:35] <causative_> but could be
[02:28:47] <biys> what is the perceived benefit?
[02:29:02] <causative_> the cool factor of having a robot butler to bring you things
[02:29:25] <biys> is it ethical to promote slavery?
[02:29:49] <amigojapan> What do you mean by "telepresence is solved" I don't know if a way to go around my house when I am not there
[02:29:51] <causative_> I'm talking about current technology, the robot is not actually intelligent
[02:30:05] <biys> cause i don't think, given the rail and rod situation, the robot would have the ability to leave
[02:30:08] <biys> and you aren't paying it
[02:30:12] <biys> so it's technically slavery
[02:30:35] <causative_> it might be slavery if the robot was a person, but I'm not talking about a high level of technology
[02:30:43] <causative_> I'm talking about the current level of technology
[02:31:06] <causative_> the robot knows how to recognize and grasp certain objects and how to navigate the rails, and that's about it
[02:31:17] <causative_> it's not more intelligent than your laptop computer
[02:31:28] <causative_> amigojapan, telepresence robots already exist and you can buy them
[02:31:45] <causative_> they're just a basic wheeled chassis with a camera, mic, and speaker
[02:32:15] <causative_> e.g. https://www.doublerobotics.com/
[02:32:15] <ro-bot-o> [url] Double Robotics - Telepresence Robot for the Hybrid Office | www.doublerobotics.com
[02:32:33] <causative_> no clue why this thing had to cost $4000
[02:33:05] <amigojapan> causative_: the ceiling rails with a football dangling off a string sounds better tho
[02:33:39] <causative_> only because it can go up/down stairs and grasp heavy things that it could carry underneath it
[02:34:09] <audrey> this sounds like the sort of fancy schmancy expensive but utterly useless piece of technological crap that my ex would buy
[02:34:12] <causative_> for a telepresence robot, there would either be an elevator, or another person to carry the bot up/down the stairs (because the whole point of telepresence is there's another person there that you're talking to)
[02:34:33] <audrey> Can you believe it, she bought a $60 gadget to open the window blinds for her whenever she clapped.
[02:34:39] <audrey> And tried to tell me it was a good investment.
[02:34:55] <causative_> and for telepresence robot, it also should be more like a person, for psychological reasons - screen at eye height, "feet"
[02:36:21] <causative_> I mean, maybe a telepresence robot would be slightly improved if it could also grasp rails and use them to traverse stairs
[02:36:29] <causative_> but it's not essential
[02:36:52] <causative_> but it is essential if you want the bot to carry things for you and access any part of your house to flip switches
[02:38:48] <causative_> there could also be appliances designed to operate with the bot - a coffee maker designed so the bot can operate it and transport the specially shaped cup of coffee without spilling it
[02:39:34] <causative_> i.e. the cup of coffee would have a secure lid and a handle in the middle of the lid for the bot to grasp

[10:19:29] <Delf> I am human... but I'm also not. It is best just to consider me human, most of the time

[10:21:27] <arryana> oh, i personally consider everyone here to be human, despite whatever they claim.
[10:21:32] <arryana> but that's just my take.
[10:22:01] <Delf> That's a good start I suppose
[10:22:25] <Delf> Animals have emotions too btw
[10:23:13] <Delf> People who want to try to control their emotions is people who have problems with their emotions. I have no problems whatsoever, with my emotions
[10:24:00] <Delf> If I feel like putting a fist through someones face, does not mean I will succumb to my emotions or feelings.

[21:25:54] <arryana> wow, that's a lot of rational and measured thinking.  rare to see on irc.
[21:25:58] <arryana> kudos.
[21:30:48] <causative_> evolv, when people believe falsehoods, they act on falsehoods, and that affects everyone including you.  e.g. the recent election fraud and antivax stuff in the US, theocracy anywhere, the personality cult in North Korea
[21:31:02] <causative_> it does matter what other people believe
[21:31:59] <dispersed> but you need to realize not everyone says what they believe, they lead you to believe they believe and then your belief is the wrong one
[21:32:11] <causative_> yes, lies are bad
[21:33:11] <causative_> "May the truth move you; may the truth [and only the truth] move you [to emotion, and to action]"
[21:33:11] <dispersed> classic example is that people "believe in god", yet how many of them can really even explain what they believe
[21:33:14] <dispersed> I'd say about 0%
[21:33:35] <causative_> oh I think they have an idea of what god is
[21:33:37] <dispersed> but loads of people believe that the others believe, and then lie they believe in turn
[21:33:42] <causative_> often different ideas for different people
[21:34:04] <causative_> but basically, "magic sky father created us all and says you must obey our religion or he'll hurt you"
[21:34:24] <dispersed> I think most of them are liars
[21:34:32] <dispersed> some of them unwittingly, as in self-deceit etc
[21:34:42] <causative_> an unwitting liar is not a liar
[21:34:54] <causative_> to lie you must be aware you are lying
[21:34:57] <dispersed> they're not honest
[21:35:22] <causative_> perhaps not
[21:35:43] <causative_> but intellectual honesty is something that has to be learned, and is difficult to learn, and even when you know it, sometimes difficult to choose over other more tempting options
[21:36:20] <causative_> I don't think most religious people are liars
[21:36:29] <causative_> they just haven't learned what is an adequate standard of proof
[21:36:50] <causative_> they've subordinated "the social" to "the rational"
[21:36:53] <causative_> er, other way around
[21:36:58] <causative_> they've subordinated "the rational" to "the social"
[21:37:39] <causative_> that is, they accept as true what their tribal authorities tell them, and what will gain them social favor; they do this instinctively and intuitively, as they have done since childhood
[21:37:48] <dispersed> that's exactly why you need to be very careful around people who claim they believe - because that claim is social
[21:37:50] <evolv> causative_, those things are not as bad as overconsumption
[21:38:21] <arryana> its going to be a hard road for people to consume less.
[21:38:58] <evolv> throw in reproduction as among the set of overconsumption. Population density increases the spread of disease
[21:39:13] <arryana> no argument that it's necessary, but less feels like a punishment to those who have never known lack.
[21:39:51] <causative_> "We should consume less" is a highly ideologically charged claim in today's politics; half of the US takes it as a threat and a communist plot
[21:39:57] <causative_> and they do so because of what they believe

[21:40:54] <causative_> true, but that doesn't change what half the people in the US think about it
[21:41:28] <evolv> but your argument is true of any stance people don't believe in
[21:41:41] <causative_> yes, beliefs matter, especially when they impact public policy
[21:41:55] <evolv> yes, thus we're all highly ideological

[21:42:13] <evolv> and we're back to, "then it doesn't concern me"
[21:42:18] <evolv> because it's out of our control
[21:42:35] <causative_> we can try to control a little bit of what other people believe
[21:42:41] <causative_> we have a moral duty to try to be more reasonable and help persuade others around us to be more reasonable
[21:43:05] <causative_> if as a nation we fail in this duty, as a nation we lose
[21:43:36] <arryana> it won't e a choice for people much longer.  environmental/systemic breakdowns will require people to learn to do with less.
[21:43:41] <evolv> yes, it's our relationship with our emotions and how we act in response that require most attention and effort
[21:43:59] <evolv> we must act with compassion, not with anger nor force
[21:44:06] <evolv> and live by our values
[21:44:20] <causative_> except when anger or force are called for
[21:44:25] <evolv> they never are
[21:45:17] <causative_> sometimes the enemy can only be resisted by force, e.g. if the world community treated the Nazis with compassion and without force, the world by now would be the third reich
[21:45:36] <arryana> oh, don't overestimate people.  a number of them will just take, and take from whomever or wherever they can.
[21:45:41] <arryana> people wlll always be people
[21:46:11] <evolv> there is no reason to assume force was the only option wrt the nazis
[21:46:28] <arryana> ...
[21:46:37] <arryana> that's a bit idealistic.
[21:46:51] <evolv> it is idealistic to believe peace can be solved with violence
[21:47:21] <evolv> despite history demonstrating how much more effort is spent cleaning up the fallout from the consequences of force
[21:47:24] * arryana shrugs
[21:47:25] <causative_> some people can't be reasoned with and can only be stopped by force
[21:47:29] <arryana> i can't say i agree.
[21:47:36] <arryana> why do buddhist temples have guards, then?
[21:47:52] <evolv> which temples?
[21:48:09] <arryana> i knew a temple guard.  and he wasn't there to reason with anyone
[21:48:17] <arryana> his particular one was in vietna,
[21:48:18] <evolv> which school?
[21:48:19] <arryana> vietnam
[21:48:23] <arryana> i never asked.
[21:48:42] <causative_> we have police because such people exist - society can't exist without using violent force to enforce its laws, when necessary
[21:48:53] <evolv> Vietnam is predominantly Thien
[21:48:57] <evolv> a mahayana tradition
[21:49:30] <evolv> but guards are probably found at many Theravada monasteries, too
[21:49:33] <arryana> peace is a lovely thing.  but it won't stop anyone who wants to destroy it.  and there will always be those who find it more compelling to kick over other people's sandcastles than to build their own.
[21:50:01] <evolv> I wouldn't go to a monastery which employs guards
[21:50:08] <evolv> assuming those guards use force
[21:51:23] <evolv> what I'm arguing isn't the ideal of not using force is free from danger
[21:52:08] <evolv> rather, I'd argue security is overly idealistic
[21:52:34] <evolv> that learning how to cope with insecurity and let go is more practical
[21:52:49] <causative_> tell that to the Holocaust victims
[21:53:32] <causative_> deadly force usually can't be reasoned with - the choices are to let it have what it wants, or to oppose it with a stronger deadly force
[21:53:39] <evolv> tell that to everyone who has lost someone to war
[21:54:29] <causative_> most wars are unjust, but WW2 is an exception; there was a right side and a wrong side in WW2, and the right side won

[22:05:17] <evolv> arryana, believing each individual has value?
[22:05:19] <causative_> apply the same logic to sandwiches, evolv , and you see it makes no sense; suppose I have to throw one sandwich in the trash compactor to save a hundred sandwiches from being smashed. I would do so. Does this mean that sandwiches have no value?

[22:08:59] <causative_> no, individuals are worth a lot more than sandwiches
[22:09:05] <causative_> but it's still a finite amount

[22:09:45] <arryana> i'd love to see, lumi, when it's ready
[22:09:59] <causative_> evolv, to refuse to sacrifice one to save many, is to devalue the many
[22:10:00] <audrey> Once we start getting into PHIL201, let me know.
[22:10:08] <arryana> haha
[22:10:23] <causative_> if U is the value of an individual, then 1,000,000 x U > 1 x U, unless U is 0 or negative
[22:10:26] <biys> audrey: should people be allowed to hold views that subvert a society?
[22:10:34] <biys> in more than private
[22:10:45] <evolv> audrey, that requires asking why violence is always bad
[22:10:48] <causative_> evolv, by refusing to act as if 1,000,000 x U > 1 x U, you are implicitly valuing U as 0 or negative; it is you who is devaluing human life by your choice
[22:11:21] <biys> should we allow people to hold a view that the flat is earth?  given how preposterous it is
[22:11:26] <audrey> biys: Heck, I don't even know what I'm going to have for dinner, I think that level of moral thinking is above my paygrade :D
[22:11:31] <biys> i'd say the same should be asked about other questions
[22:11:41] <biys> such as the idea that a claim can be made that people have a right to life, for example
[22:11:50] <scoobicu> what do u think about hegel perspective on history?
[22:11:53] <evolv> causative_, there are more variables than U
[22:11:56] <audrey> In general I'm okay with letting people have cuckoo views, mostly because it's impossible to make a person change their views by force.
[22:12:06] <biys> what makes it so some outlandish ideas can be perpetuated, yet others are looked at with absolute disgust?
[22:12:10] <audrey> It's really no skin off my back if someone thinks the moon is made of Muenster cheese.
[22:12:24] <audrey> That doesn't concern me.
[22:12:44] <causative_> biys, we shouldn't punish people directly because they hold a view; that is the path to totalitarianism. People must be free to hold whatever views they wish. But it is right to restrain people from *acting* on their views, when such actions would harm others; and it is right to try to persuade and educate them of the correct views.
[22:12:50] <audrey> Attempts to coerce or shame individuals into renouncing various conspiracy theories, nonsense etc. usually result in those beliefs becoming more entrenched.
[22:13:01] <biys> how is the harm measured?
[22:13:46] <causative_> it should be remembered that the government can be wrong too, and historically often is. A system in which dissent is not allowed, is a poor system for *finding* the truth
[22:13:47] <evolv> audrey, worse, even just using bare evidence without judgment results in the backfire effect as well
[22:13:59] <causative_> because sometimes the individual will be right and the government consensus will be wrong
[22:14:05] <Henry151> See, you've been conditioned to believe that suffering is bad. It's not.
[22:14:12] <biys> ^ this kind of as well
[22:14:23] <evolv> suffering is always bad
[22:14:27] <causative_> a truth-finding system needs to be open to change based on new evidence
[22:14:37] <causative_> and censorship prevents that
[22:14:38] <audrey> In my rather jaded opinion, people usually don't care about changing cuckoo beliefs. They just like to dunk on them and use it as a means of feeling self-righteous and virtue signaling.
[22:14:40] <biys> the evidence isn't necessarily objective though
[22:14:46] <biys> it could be assocaited with the understanding at the time
[22:14:49] <biys> which could be inaccurate
[22:14:54] <audrey> That's my off the cuff take on this, biys. I don't know if this is what you were getting at since the initial question was a bit vague.

[22:16:06] <causative_> the ideal is that the whole society works like a rational, impartial truth-seeking mind. We should set up social institutions and laws designed to get us as close to that ideal as we can.
[22:16:21] <evolv> anyway, we've deviated from my ideal stance of reducing consumption, namely at the individual level by choice
[22:16:28] <evolv> since overconsumption is harmful
[22:16:40] <evolv> in the set of overconsumption includes reproduction
[22:16:55] <Henry151> evolv: i found it because i looked up the wikipedia page for another great film, Waking Life, and saw that "The film contains several parallels to Linklater's 1991 film Slacker. "
[22:16:59] <biys> causative_: what if it was to come to "truth" that your society found it most admirable to remove an entire group of people from existence?
[22:17:02] <Henry151> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Life
[22:17:02] <ro-bot-o> [url] Waking Life - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[22:17:08] <biys> i'm sure it could be rationalized to some extent given any particular circumstance
[22:17:12] <evolv> Henry151, wasn't Slacker a highly influential film?
[22:17:17] <biys> just a modest proposal is all it would take
[22:17:20] <causative_> biys, well, we probably shouldn't do that
[22:17:31] <biys> but if you could quantify it being in the best interest
[22:17:34] <evolv> I also couldn't finish Waking Life
[22:17:36] <biys> would it not be the most rational position?
[22:17:50] <Henry151> but the point is real, that even the word "harm" presupposes a value judgement, it assumes that we both agree that harm exists, or that pain is somehow worse than joy
[22:18:09] <evolv> there isn't such a duality
[22:18:18] <evolv> between pain and joy is peace
[22:18:22] <causative_> then maybe it would biys but historically when society has committed genocide, it has not been for sound rational reasons; it has been for tribal, emotional demagoguery
[22:18:34] <evolv> an evenness of mind
[22:18:43] <causative_> evolv, problem is, suppose that person A has few children and person B has lots of children. Person B's descendants are going to be more common in a hundred years, and they'll inherit the tendency to have lots of children.
[22:18:44] <Henry151> violence, always thought to be "bad", but is it "bad" when two stars collide, far more violently than any human interaction?
[22:18:44] <biys> which in itself could be argued as necesasry or not
[22:18:50] <biys> it simply depends who it is you're asking
[22:19:07] <causative_> evolv, so person A's responsible choice to have fewer children doesn't matter in the end; the person A type of person is just going to die out
[22:19:13] <biys> are you suggesting that the german people in germany prior to world war 2 are inherently "bad" people?
[22:19:16] <biys> by any metric?
[22:19:17] <biys> STUPID people?
[22:19:17] <evolv> causative_, that's not true at all
[22:19:31] <biys> stupid and bad?
[22:19:37] <causative_> yes biys
[22:19:44] <Henry151> pain, suffering, joy, peace, violence, they all simply "are." I don't suppose that if I make a value judgement and say that one way is better than the other, that I've got any more claim to being "right" than anybody else.
[22:19:44] <causative_> nazis were stupid and bad
[22:19:52] <causative_> just like modern-day nazis
[22:19:53] <biys> that's an interesting take on it
[22:20:02] <biys> i guess it makes it a simple summarization then
[22:20:06] <Henry151> I'll still punch a nazi :)
[22:20:07] <biys> germans = stupid
[22:20:10] <biys> therefor ww2
[22:20:14] <evolv> in fact, reproduction has been declining in parts of the world, e.g. the WEst
[22:20:15] <causative_> when I first learned about nazism I used to worry that the potential for nazism was hidden in all of us, including myself
[22:20:29] <causative_> but recent events have shown me which demographic likes nazi-style doctrines, and it isn't the one I'm in
[22:20:41] <causative_> the people to whom nazism appeals are stupid and bad
[22:20:49] <shea> Profound
[22:20:53] <evolv> while our grandparents were often sibling of 8, their children were siblings of 2-3

[22:21:56] * arryana knits
[22:22:17] <audrey> Someone ping me when we're no longer scraping the bottom of the barrel and invoking Godwin's Law every 5 minutes.
[22:22:28] <audrey> I'm going back to Beethoven.
[22:22:35] <evolv> audrey, this channel has rarely gone beyond this
[22:22:42] <arryana> enjoy
[22:22:50] <evolv> I've never seen anyone take a purely utilitarian stance
[22:23:01] <evolv> until today, that is
[22:23:12] <causative_> my stance is not purely utilitarian evolv
[22:23:31] <evolv> you likened the value of people to the single variable "U"
[22:23:45] <causative_> it's a simplified approximation
[22:23:49] <causative_> I say that to seek the truth is the greatest good, and we should organize our society to maximize truth-seeking
[22:24:06] <causative_> having a lot of different people living different lives and having different experiences to draw on, helps with that
[22:24:21] <shea> "evolv, by refusing to act as if 1,000,000 x U > 1 x U, you are implicitly valuing U as 0 or negative; it is you who is devaluing human life by your choice" causative_ being absurd again
[22:25:12] <arryana> talk is cheap, and comfortable to the ego. i'm far more a fan of concrete action.  even if it's just knitting a garment.
[22:25:30] <evolv> arryana, faith without works is dead ;D
[22:26:16] <biys> his stance definitely isn't utilitarian
[22:26:27] <biys> as he can't justify the destruction of a group of people for the "greater good"
[22:26:35] <biys> which is what he suggested his position was based on
[22:26:44] <biys> some idea of harm reduction that is beneficial for all people
[22:26:56] <biys> causative_: would you go back in time, if you could, and kill baby hitler?
[22:27:01] <biys> knowing what you know now
[22:27:38] <evolv> he just said earlier he'd personally torture someone he loved the most if given the choice between that and someone setting off bombs and a fire in a city
[22:27:50] <biys> interesting
[22:27:50] <arryana> faith is your choice.  i'm fine with just works.
[22:27:58] <causative_> yes biys
[22:28:11] <evolv> in this context, faith == ideology
[22:28:17] <evolv> in which we all hold
[22:28:33] <biys> it's an interesting conversation
[22:28:53] *** Quits: qu4nt1n (~qu4nt1n@78.198.214.34) (Quit: KVIrc 5.0.0 Aria http://www.kvirc.net/)
[22:29:18] <shea> It's another silly hypothetical
[22:29:23] <biys> it all is erally
[22:29:56] <shea> But that question is exceedingly silly
[22:30:15] <biys> well what it comes down to is attempting to apply a rational to any/all scenarios
[22:30:31] <biys> attempting to apply the utilitarian argument to any scenario with any number of variables
[22:30:41] <biys> scrutinize it in some way or another to see if it holds up
[22:31:04] <causative_> there are problems with utilitarianism, but "ending one life to save a million" is not one of them
[22:31:20] <biys> but ending many lives to save many lives is a problem
[22:31:29] <causative_> depends on how many
[22:31:42] <causative_> and on how rationally sure we can be that it will have the desired effect
[22:31:42] <biys> the problem is you can't foresee the future
[22:31:55] <biys> so you don't know what results there will be of any circumstance
[22:31:59] *** Quits: CitraBenzoet (~CitraBenz@user/citrabenzoet) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:31:59] <biys> which is why i mention the wildebeest in africa
[22:32:03] <biys> or the sea turtles in texas
[22:32:05] <causative_> well, we should be rational about our limitations in foreseeing the future, and not commit horrible acts that are likely not to turn out good in the end
[22:32:22] <biys> the wildebeest is a terrible state no?
[22:32:27] <causative_> when we are uncertain if an act is good it is often rational to refrain
[22:32:35] <biys> i mean..  we could do something to prevent the sginficant amount of death as a  result of a failed migration
[22:32:38] <biys> no?
[22:32:43] <biys> the question is SHOULD we?
[22:33:06] <biys> is, just because it's death, a _bad_ thing
[22:33:16] <biys> it actually ends up being significantly beneficial for the ecosystem
[22:33:20] <causative_> wildebeest are a "least-concern" species according to IUCN, what's the terrible state you're referring to?
[22:33:27] <evolv> would you save a billion hitlers to save ten Jewish people?
[22:33:34] <evolv> er
[22:33:36] <biys> ^
[22:33:40] <biys> kill a billion hitlers
[22:33:48] <evolv> save a billion hitlers by killing ten Jewish people
[22:33:53] <biys> better yet!
[22:34:15] <causative_> that's a tricky one evolv because the consequences to society of the billion hitlers surviving
[22:34:19] <causative_> what kind of a world would they build?
[22:34:21] <shea> But then, of course, those billion Hitlers would proceed to kill 6 milliion jews
[22:34:34] <causative_> then in that case I would not save them
[22:34:36] <evolv> ok, causative_, so now we're beyond a single variable "U"
[22:34:57] <causative_> er, wait
[22:35:11] <causative_> the billion hitlers only kill 6 million? then still I would have to think about it
[22:35:21] <shea> No they kill 6 million each
[22:35:24] <audrey> Good grief, people
[22:35:31] <shea> I said it as a joke
[22:35:35] <audrey> Please take further hitler talk to ##Philosophy-off
[22:35:41] <evolv> audrey, lol
[22:35:44] <biys> hahah
[22:35:46] <audrey> Seriously.
[22:36:20] <evolv> what if Hitler was still alive and here, but never talked about himself nor his past?
[22:36:29] <evolv> and we all left to *-off
[22:36:34] <evolv> leaving you and Hitler?
[22:36:35] <causative_> Nazis were an important moral lesson, and by forgetting how bad they were and why they happened, we are playing right into the hands of modern neo-nazis who want to do it again
[22:36:36] * arryana just shakes her head at people who don't know when to drop it
[22:37:21] <biys> causative_: the thing with the wildebeest goes someting liek this.  every now and again the migration of literally millions of wildebeest through africa goes bad.  and there's a significant amount of death as a result of it
[22:37:31] <evolv> causative_, this is why we must trivialize every argument to Godwin's law, as audrey more-or-less pointed out in disgust?
[22:37:48] *** Joins: Shashin (~Shashin@pd9ed4bb5.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[22:37:52] <biys> now the significant amount of suffering and harm that is a result of the failed migration is perceived as "bad"
[22:38:01] <evolv> the value of people -> the value of sandwiches -> Nazis
[22:38:01] <biys> but the results it has within the ecosystem on a whole is entirely good
[22:38:05] *** Joins: I_Am_M00t (uid427178@id-427178.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[22:38:05] <evolv> that happened here
[22:38:17] <causative_> Godwin's law plays into the hands of nazis, by prohibiting serious discussion of the problems and social trends that historical Nazism ought to put on guard about
[22:38:28] <biys> so for you to simply summarize mass death as "inherently bad"
[22:38:31] <biys> i'm kind of amazed at that
[22:38:46] <biys> because it very well could have a significant positive impact as you progress through time and space
[22:38:57] <audrey> If you've received an invite from me to join ##philosophy-off, that's your very subtle signal to take the conversation there.
[22:39:03] <audrey> If you haven't received the invite, carry on. 8-)
[22:39:21] <evolv> no thanks
[22:39:40] <evolv> I have no intentions of talking about Nazis any further
[22:40:23] *** Joins: darklambda (~whateverg@111.65.32.211)
[22:40:41] <evolv> I would have preferred if the topic stayed on consumption
[22:40:56] <biys> i'm actually a big fan of the idea of quantification of consumption
[22:41:00] <biys> as well as systems integration
[22:41:10] <evolv> this felt like a distraction from contending with the harm from our luxuries
[22:41:20] <causative_> biys, what specific kind of suffering does the migration cause?
[22:41:34] <causative_> just dead wildebeests? and what would we do about it, and what would be the impact on the ecosystem if we did?
[22:41:52] <causative_> massive herds of ungulates aren't usually good for the environment, and wildebeest are "least concern"
[22:42:18] <biys> interesting
[22:42:44] <biys> you've never read about the failed migration of the GNU in africa?
[22:42:59] <causative_> no
[22:43:04] <biys> and the millions of tons of carcass that results?
[22:43:17] <biys> it happens every now and again
[22:44:38] <biys> and the same with the turtled in Texas during the big freeze that happened last year
[22:44:43] <biys> humans intervened
[22:44:54] <biys> they intervened to prevent suffering/harm
[22:45:06] <biys> without completely understanding the impact it would have on the ecosystem
[22:45:14] <biys> is the harm reduction the admirable goal?
[22:45:24] <biys> what if the harm reduction results in something more catastrophic?
[22:45:42] <causative_> harm reduction is, but it is more difficult to say what is "harm" when we're talking about ecosystems rather than people
[22:45:44] <biys> the perceived harm reduction
[22:45:50] <causative_> yes, if it results in catastrophe then it is harmful to do it
[22:45:59] <biys> so it's just humans we're attempting to reduce harm for?
[22:46:08] <biys> should we bubble wrap the planet and kill all predators?
[22:46:13] <biys> we should kill rats?
[22:46:18] <causative_> no, I say that the greatest good is seeking-after-truth
[22:46:24] <biys> we should kill anything biological that's potentially harmful for humans?
[22:46:38] <causative_> not just humans, but any organism or system that seeks after truth should be protected
[22:46:51] <scoobicu> causative_ nonsensical
[22:46:53] <causative_> aliens, if they seek after truth like we do, should be protected
[22:47:01] <causative_> machine intelligences, if they seek after truth, should be protected
[22:47:17] <biys> what if the aliens initiative involved mass extermination of everything on earth for their survival?
[22:47:26] <evolv> seeking after truth is a bizarre parameter to place value of sentient beings on
[22:47:41] <causative_> seeking-after-truth is the only thing that makes sapient beings sapient to begin with
[22:47:52] <biys> this conversation is silly
[22:47:59] <scoobicu> the silliest 100
[22:48:07] <evolv> sapience isn't defined by truth-seeking
[22:48:17] <causative_> sapience is defined by cognitive ability
[22:48:25] <causative_> which is truth-seeking
[22:48:48] <causative_> https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sapience
[22:48:48] <ro-bot-o> [url] Sapience Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster | www.merriam-webster.com
[22:48:58] <evolv> or imaginative ability independently from truth-seeking
[22:49:11] <evolv> the... dictionary was pulled out
[22:49:17] <evolv> I feel trolled
[22:49:31] <causative_> just in case there was some confusion between sapience and sentience
[22:49:38] <evolv> there wasn't
[22:49:49] <causative_> imagination is a powerful tool for truth-seeking, the fact humans have imagination is a large part of why we're able to understand things around us
[22:50:27] <evolv> what is the value of truth?
[22:50:44] <causative_> truth is what lets us know the value of anything
[22:50:58] <evolv> so it's tautological?
[22:51:01] <causative_> no
[22:51:04] <scoobicu> nonsensical
[22:51:11] <evolv> the value of truth is determining value?
[22:51:18] <causative_> truth is valuable because it lets us know the value of other things
[22:51:23] <scoobicu> it isnt tautological because it isnt tautological, right causative_ ?
[22:51:34] <evolv> the value of beings is attributed to the value of truth because truth is what determines what is valuable?
[22:51:41] <causative_> like a wrench is useful because it lets us build other useful things
[22:51:41] <shea> Truth is valuable in of itself
[22:52:58] <shea> That truth has value is axiomatic and can't be disptued. The mere act of disputing it is to tacitally accept its value
[22:53:03] <causative_> suppose I say that "beings are valuable because they have property Foo." Well, to make this claim is to assert a truth. If we didn't know the truth about property Foo, then we would be failing to properly value beings; truth is a prerequisite to acting rightly and respecting their value.
[22:53:19] <evolv> I thought the wrench was useful because it allows us to build things we want to build with greater ease and stability?
[22:53:35] <shea> s/tacitally/tacitly
[22:53:35] <ro-bot-o> shea meant to say: That truth has value is axiomatic and can't be disptued. The mere act of disputing it is to tacitly accept its value
[22:53:49] <causative_> without truth we have only incoherent actions; we cannot have moral actions unless we first know the truth of what actions are moral
[22:54:10] <causative_> evolv, exactly so, and what I said
[22:54:26] <evolv> causative_, so something useful is something that gets us what we think we want?
[22:54:33] <causative_> but I phrased it in a manner so it was clear how the usefulness of the wrench relates analogously to the value of truth
[22:55:22] <causative_> we may put it this way.  right is right and wrong is wrong; and to know right from wrong is also right. Because without knowing right from wrong, we cannot act rightly.
[22:55:36] <shea> causative_: hahahahahahahahaahahahahahhaha
[22:55:53] <scoobicu> u just statted pure nonsense
[22:56:05] <causative_> scoobicu, if you aren't going to contribute, please stop
[22:56:09] <shea> Not THAT is a tautology
[22:56:17] <scoobicu> maaan
[22:56:57] <causative_> it is not a tautology. "right is right and wrong is wrong" is a tautology but not the main thrust of the claim
[22:56:59] <scoobicu> u are saying what u are saying because u are saying what u are saying and u arent saying what u arent saying because u are not saying what u are saying. and im no contributing?
[22:57:16] <scoobicu> *not saying
[22:57:18] <evolv> I'm not entirely sure causative_ isn't just fucking with us
[22:57:39] <scoobicu> causative_ is the fucking itself
[22:57:47] <causative_> I'm always serious evolv , but I am sometimes hard to understand without meaning to be
[22:57:51] <causative_> and my views are unconventional
[22:58:14] <causative_> so if you don't catch my meaning, ask me to clarify the parts you are stuck on
[22:58:20] <evolv> maybe truth seeking is bad here. I don't have the resources to determine the sincerity of causative_'s words, and I may spend more energy and time trying to seek the truth than the value of the answer holds
[22:59:03] <causative_> tbh I don't understand how you would fail to understand what I said about "without knowing right from wrong, we cannot act rightly"
[22:59:06] <causative_> it just seems obvious to me
[22:59:48] <shea> We should perhaps keep in mind causative_'s point from whence this discussion about the value of truth emerged, where he said "not just humans, but any organism or system that seeks after truth should be protected"
[22:59:52] <causative_> it's like saying without knowing which moves in a chess game are correct, we can't play welll
[23:00:21] <shea> I did failed to understand it, I was saying it was a fault of style, which is what tautology refers to
[23:00:32] <causative_> that's not what tautology refers to
[23:00:33] <shea> I did not fail to understand it*
[23:01:03] <evolv> the argument isn't about whether right or wrong can emerge only with knowledge of right and wrong
[23:01:04] <shea> "noun
[23:01:06] <shea> the saying of the same thing twice over in different words, generally considered to be a fault of style (e.g. they arrived one after the other in succession ).yy
[23:01:10] <evolv> but what right and wrong actually are
[23:01:20] <causative_> a tautology is a statement that is true for any substitution of logical variables, independently of any reference to external facts
[23:01:22] <evolv> we actually have to move further back
[23:01:40] <causative_> this is philosophy, when you say "tautology" here you should be talking about what it means in logic
[23:02:08] <causative_> "a statement that is true by necessity or by virtue of its logical form"
[23:02:24] <shea> I'm not doing semantics with you again.
[23:02:52] <shea> As always, causative_, any conversation with you devolves into the same thing. You really are a creature of habit.
[23:02:52] <causative_> then stop misinterpreting me, and thus requiring me to explain the semantics of what I mean
[23:03:00] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[23:03:09] <I_Am_M00t> authoritarianism ftw
[23:03:12] <shea> I said you had a failure of style. I didn't misinterpret you. Stop doing this again
[23:03:50] <causative_> anyway, even if you use the definition of "the saying of the same thing twice in different words," not even that applies
[23:03:51] <shea> I more interested in you trying to defend this absurd statement "not just humans, but any organism or system that seeks after truth should be protected  "
[23:04:15] <shea> Which was supplemented with "aliens, if they seek after truth like we do, should be protected"
[23:04:23] <causative_> because sapience is what grants beings moral worth
[23:04:30] <causative_> an alien with an intelligent mind is as much a person as a human being is
[23:04:37] <shea> Hahahahahahahhahahahahaah
[23:04:39] <I_Am_M00t> this is dogmatism rebranded as earnest seeking
[23:04:42] <evolv> granted by whom, causative_?
[23:04:52] <shea> evolv: Do not engage. Do not feed.
[23:04:55] <I_Am_M00t> :) and if you ever question him, he will say you're not following *his* rules of honest discussion
[23:05:06] <I_Am_M00t> i just shake me head
[23:05:09] <evolv> shea, too late, we've been doing this for too long
[23:05:15] <shea> I_Am_M00t: I'm glad others are aware of his silly tactics
[23:05:25] <I_Am_M00t> he's a shallow thinker
[23:05:26] <shea> A pure sophist.
[23:06:06] <evolv> now I'm just curious what the answers will be to questions that normally arise to mind when thinking these things
[23:06:13] <causative_> there are only two iron rules of elenchus:  answer questions about your position and why you hold it, and don't get mad; don't insult the other person or his claims
[23:06:22] <I_Am_M00t> "elenchus" is the ultimate troll
[23:06:30] <shea> Here we go again
[23:06:35] <I_Am_M00t> it's authoritarianism in its subtlest form
[23:06:44] <shea> The bastion of elenchus, causative_
[23:06:51] <I_Am_M00t> now any criticism against him is necessarily rule breaking
[23:06:57] <causative_> if "answer questions about your beliefs and don't get mad" is too much "authoritarianism" for you, that's on you
[23:07:03] <I_Am_M00t> this is the foundation of all discussion with him, unless you follow his etiquette, you're wrong
[23:07:19] <I_Am_M00t> he doesn't have to justify his rules to you, but you have to justify why you break his rules
[23:07:30] <evolv> I agree, no insulting
[23:07:32] <I_Am_M00t> basically, he's picking a fight
[23:07:40] <causative_> you can certainly criticize, but to engage in a rational debate you must criticize by pointing out a contradiction, or saying that you disagree; to criticize through insults is not rational
[23:07:42] <shea> It is so satisfying to be vindicated by others in this channel, I have thought the same thing for much too long
[23:07:52] <evolv> but I agree with everyone else's sentiments that causative_ is not giving adequate answers to the questions
[23:07:57] <I_Am_M00t> shea: no, many people see it, it's just not worth it
[23:08:04] <I_Am_M00t> he's very self-involved
[23:08:08] <evolv> often confusing more than illuminating
[23:08:28] <shea> I suppose we're the silly ones. I for one always get sucked in
[23:08:36] <evolv> it would then benefit causative_ to develop skills in communication
[23:08:48] <I_Am_M00t> whatever, from what i see 90% of intellectualism is like this
[23:08:58] <I_Am_M00t> it's just sly tactics, and using big words to say simple things
[23:09:16] <I_Am_M00t> the difficulty is not in thinking, but in seeing through the fog
[23:09:28] <evolv> perhaps it's not intentional, I_Am_M00t
[23:09:39] <causative_> it's a lot easier to communicate when people are insulting you and saying your views are ridiculous, instead of interrogating you to genuinely find out what you believe
[23:09:48] <evolv> perhaps it's due to lack of skill
[23:10:02] <I_Am_M00t> "elenchus" is very beautiful in this regard
[23:10:04] <causative_> if you want to communicate and something is not clear, you have to make an honest effort, not just resort to "I don't agree with this so I will insult the other person"
[23:10:12] <I_Am_M00t> it shows all the flaws perfectly, because it is completely contextless
[23:10:24] <shea> It's my belief that the lofty language is used as a means of obfuscating meaning as a tacit to make him difficult to respond to
[23:10:42] <evolv> causative_, it is more skillful to address the questions and arguments put forward to you than to complain about how you're insulted
[23:11:08] <causative_> if the "questions and arguments" are actually just insults, and any response to them is met with insults, it is very difficult for any real communication to take place
[23:11:15] <evolv> you've ignored questions and arguments posed to blanketly tell the channel not to insult
[23:11:16] <I_Am_M00t> it's amazing to me how someone can look at simple rule sets for arguments, and believe they've found a formula that works in reality
[23:11:28] <I_Am_M00t> it's also amazing how any argument is met with "don't insult me, be nice"
[23:11:39] <evolv>  <evolv> granted by whom, causative_?
[23:11:40] <causative_> because once people start with the flames, you can't get past them; you can't reason with someone who is going to insult you when you respond
[23:11:43] <evolv> I asked that question, causative_
[23:11:45] <I_Am_M00t> elenchus is the foundation of authoritarianism, mark my words
[23:11:58] <causative_> evolv, if we can agree to stop with the insults and rudeness, then I will respond
[23:12:06] <I_Am_M00t> it's the essence of a system that can't take feedback
[23:12:08] <evolv> causative_, I didn't insult you

[23:12:42] <causative_> <evolv> I'm not entirely sure causative_ isn't just fucking with us
[23:12:59] <causative_> <evolv> I feel trolled
[23:13:00] <evolv> that is the truth, causative_. I am not entirely sure
[23:13:10] <shea> causative_, I suggest that you invoke elenchus in the same way that the youth of Athens invoked it, which Socrates warned against as such youth were merely being troublemakers.
[23:13:26] <shea> In fact, I am sure of it
[23:13:31] <causative_> well, it's an insult evolv
[23:13:37] <causative_> to be fair you haven't insulted me much; others have done more of that
[23:13:46] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[23:13:49] <I_Am_M00t> here we go again
[23:13:50] <evolv> causative_, it's not an insult.
[23:13:52] <causative_> but you have been complicit with them
[23:14:00] <evolv> you were offended, but not by an insult
[23:14:08] <causative_> to call someone a troll is obviously to insult them
[23:14:10] <I_Am_M00t> this is the issue, he thinks everything is an insult
[23:14:19] <shea> To call a troll a troll is not an insult
[23:14:21] <I_Am_M00t> maybe causative_ , you're plainly wrong
[23:14:26] <shea> It is merely "truth seeking"
[23:14:28] <evolv> I didn't call you a troll
[23:14:33] <I_Am_M00t> maybe this thing you do with elenchus is a big misguided?
[23:14:38] <I_Am_M00t> bit misguided*
[23:14:42] <evolv> that would have been an expression of certainty, causative_
[23:14:48] <evolv> or an intention to hurt
[23:14:51] <evolv> neither are true
[23:14:51] <I_Am_M00t> and maybe it's not others' duty to explain to you why it's wrong
[23:15:01] <causative_> I_Am_M00t, kindly go away, you are doing nothing positive here
[23:15:35] <shea> Can we return to this statement here "an alien with an intelligent mind is as much a person as a human being is". I would like a further explanation as how this could be true
[23:15:45] <causative_> evolv, if you think an insult is true, this does not make it any less of an insult
[23:15:53] <causative_> https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/insult
[23:15:54] <ro-bot-o> [url] Insult Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster | www.merriam-webster.com
[23:16:18] <causative_> if you call someone a troll, you are insulting them, regardless of whether they are or are not.  (and in point of fact I am not; I am always sincere)
[23:16:25] <shea> Strange, I would have thought that the insult that is true would be a good by the tenor of your previous statements
[23:16:50] <shea> Should we avoid insults even if they are true?
[23:16:54] <causative_> we can't seek truth unless we set any angry feelings aside and talk using only reason
[23:17:12] <causative_> yes, we should avoid insults even if we think they are true, as long as we're trying to debate rationally with the other person and not just fling mud
[23:17:28] <shea> So the avoidance of insulting another takes precedence over "seeking the truth"
[23:17:51] <causative_> it doesn't take precedence, avoiding insults is in service to seeking the truth
[23:18:04] <causative_> two people who are insulting each other cannot engage with reason and seek truth effectively
[23:18:17] <shea> Where to state the truth is also to insult, which is to prevail?
[23:18:48] <shea> And is to insult objective or subjective? And if subjective does that change your answer?
[23:19:00] <causative_> it would be extraordinarily difficult to have a rational discussion with someone you are insulting, to determine the truth or falsehood of those insults; it just socially is not something that happens
[23:19:07] <causative_> insults leads to a breakdown of the discourse, almost 100% of the time
[23:19:36] <causative_> you insult them, they get mad and may insult you back, neither of you becomes very interested in hearing what the other person has to say and giving it a fair consideration
[23:20:06] <shea> Ah I see. Not so much the devotee to truth as I was led to believe by what you were saying earlier.
[23:20:43] <causative_> if you think your insults are having the desired effect in defending your position or attacking the other person's position, then you feel no need to rationally refute it; to insult it feels like itenough
[23:20:53] <shea> What you say is seriously problematic in light that what is insulting is commonly thought to be subjective
[23:21:18] <causative_> insults can be true but they nearly always lead to a breakdown of mutual seeking-after-truth
[23:21:18] *** Quits: Trashlord (~trash@user/trashlord) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:21:50] <shea> I don't know how one can be seeking truth if he avoids saying true things for fear that he might insult
[23:22:55] <causative_> and this applies not just to insulting the person but also to insulting their position; if you say "that's stupid" or something to that effect, again, the other person becomes less interested in hearing you out and giving your views a fair shake, and he may insult you back, and if you think your insult has had the desired effect, you will feel less need to give a rational refutation
[23:23:20] <causative_> it may be that his position is stupid, or that he is stupid, but this we must refrain from saying if we want to mutually engage with reason
[23:24:23] <shea> Yes, but we weren't saying that your position was stupid, though it was, we were saying that you were a troll. Or, in other words, you don't engage in good faith discussion. These things are true and we should not refrain from saying them.
[23:25:14] <causative_> neither of them are true, I'm always sincere and I always answer questions about my position
[23:25:38] <causative_> and even if they were true, you should refrain from saying them as long as you want to engage my views with reason instead of emotion
[23:25:39] <shea> Those are words. Your actions are far more telling
[23:26:19] <causative_> it's bad faith to insult the other person and accuse them of talking about nothing but semantics whenever they need to clarify a word!
[23:26:30] <shea> I was engaging your views with reason. I reasoned that your techniques are consistent with a bad faith interlocutor.
[23:26:33] <causative_> elenchus is *how* we argue in good faith
[23:26:45] <biys> socratic method
[23:27:05] <shea> We do talk about nothing but semantics, causative_, isn't it true? I don't care if that insults you.
[23:27:21] <causative_> I've been talking a lot about elenchus just now shea , I wouldn't call it "semantics"
[23:27:24] <shea> You engage in a perverse version of elenchus
[23:27:29] <causative_> you only say "semantics" when I have to clarify a word
[23:27:36] <causative_> which hasn't happened for a while now
[23:28:19] <causative_> and words are important, and the semantics of words is important
[23:28:20] <shea> You are dismissing the context of what I said. I said, in effect, that your conversations with anyone always *devolve* into semantics
[23:28:29] <causative_> semantics is how we convey meaning to another person
[23:28:46] <shea> That is, talking about semantics in a way that diminishes the discussion, not enhance it
[23:28:54] <causative_> semantics is "the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning."
[23:28:59] <shea> Just sto p
[23:29:14] <shea> You are ignoring my meaning to literally engage in semantics AGANI
[23:29:14] <causative_> it's not an inherently derogatory term, though you use it that way
[23:29:18] <shea> You are a TROLL
[23:29:31] <biys> nooooooooooooo
[23:29:33] <shea> Stop engaging in semantics to diminish the conversation!
[23:29:36] <biys> i disagree
[23:29:42] <arryana> easier to just /ignore people than get so upset.
[23:29:53] <shea> No one is upset, arryana
[23:30:18] <arryana> your caps indicate otherwise
[23:30:30] <shea> My caps is merely for emphasis.
[23:30:37] <arryana> whatever you say.
[23:30:38] <causative_> shea I don't think anyone else has said anything about me "devolving into semantics" or even has had much of an issue with the vocabulary I use
[23:30:45] <causative_> that's just you
[23:30:49] <shea> Re-read what I said
[23:31:01] <shea> In particular "I said"
[23:31:12] <evolv> it's ok
[23:31:13] <evolv> let's all move on
[23:31:37] <evolv> I think it's evident the intended discussion long ended
[23:32:07] <evolv> let's talk about the philosophy in matrix 4 with spoilers included
[23:32:24] <shea> I agree. Let's return to "an alien with an intelligent mind is as much a person as a human being is" which, I think, needs a pretty robust justification for such a, let's say, bold statement
[23:32:56] <I_Am_M00t> evolv: lol, i dont know what i got out of matrix 4
[23:33:06] <causative_> shea, I will agree to talk about that with you, but you have to agree to elenchus:  keep any insults about me or my position to yourself, answer questions I have about your position. I will agree to the same.
[23:33:08] <causative_> is that a deal?
[23:33:09] <evolv> I_Am_M00t, I think Lana made it pretty clear
[23:33:19] <arryana> ender's game heirarchy of foreignness covers that
[23:33:36] <I_Am_M00t> hmm
[23:33:51] <shea> causative_, I can't agree to that, sorry.
[23:34:00] <causative_> then any discussion would have had no value anyway
[23:34:07] <evolv> I_Am_M00t, Matrix 4 was deliberately spelling out all of the intended meaning in the trilogy while pissing on WB for senseless sequels for the sake of money, fans who took away the opposite intended message, etc.
[23:34:07] <shea> Agreed
[23:34:39] <I_Am_M00t> evolv: hmm, ok... tbf i kinda droned through it
[23:35:25] <causative_> really it's a fairly popular position, that intelligent aliens should be treated as people
[23:35:47] <causative_> quite odd to apply the label of "troll" to such a commonly accepted idea
[23:36:04] <shea> You didn't say that, you said" an alien with an intelligent mind is as much a person as a human being is"
[23:36:50] <shea> It would be better, to show your good faith, if you made explicit where you modify your ideas
[23:37:00] <shea> Rather than pretending that you made that point all along
[23:37:01] <causative_> I see no meaningful difference between the two claims
[23:37:46] <shea> Well, it's fairly obvious, no? You can treat one as a person without them actually being one. To treat something as a person is not to say that they are a person
[23:37:49] <evolv> I_Am_M00t, I think that's due to the expectation of it continuing the story as if there was more to say. But I came out with the conclusion that we are meant to be reminded that the story was told completely and then given another context to see the same story told
[23:38:10] <arryana> ramen vs varelse, as it were.
[23:38:43] <causative_> well, "person" in the common discourse can refer to entities that are non-human
[23:39:04] <causative_> e.g. https://www.dictionary.com/browse/person
[23:39:05] <ro-bot-o> [url] Person Definition & Meaning | Dictionary.com | www.dictionary.com
[23:39:10] <causative_> "Philosophy. a self-conscious or rational being."
[23:39:31] <causative_> intelligent aliens should be treated as persons - assigned moral value - because they are persons
[23:40:26] <I_Am_M00t> evolv: yeah, it felt like a different movie i guess, that makes sense
[23:40:47] <I_Am_M00t> i guess i was expecting a simulation within simulations thing
[23:40:50] <shea> Okay, if we accept that, that means we have a moral obligation to protect them, as it were?
[23:40:53] <I_Am_M00t> like the world outside being a simulation too
[23:41:17] <evolv> I_Am_M00t, the sequels dealt with that indirectly by trying a bit harder to get Baudrillard right
[23:41:21] <causative_> yes shea ; what is essential about you that makes you worth protecting is your mind, not the particular human body you have
[23:41:42] <causative_> if your mind were in an alien body, it would be as essentially worthy of protection as you are
[23:41:56] <shea> And where to protect a human and to protect an alien conflict? Who prevails?
[23:42:05] <arryana> what's to say they can't protect themselves?
[23:42:13] <arryana> and how do they define it, what do they want?
[23:42:20] <evolv> I_Am_M00t, the simulation isn't being in a computer simulation, it's the real obscured substitution of the real with models of the real
[23:42:21] <causative_> whatever leads to greater good overall
[23:42:28] <arryana> i think it would be exceedingly arrogant to define those things and impose them on another species
[23:42:36] <evolv> I_Am_M00t, what is real is the heart, the heart transcends external reality
[23:42:49] <evolv> Neo and Trinity's love was present inside and outside the matrix
[23:42:50] <evolv> etc.
[23:43:06] <causative_> whatever leads to more living minds with more understanding of the universe
[23:43:07] <shea> arryana: I think that's a good point. But essentially, causative_, we determine this worth by some ultilitarian analysis?
[23:43:42] <causative_> no, as I mentioned, I consider utilitarianism only a crude approximation of what we should truly value - which is sapience itself, truth-seeking
[23:44:23] <arryana> nor do i think humans have evolved enough to even be protecting themselves.
[23:44:34] <causative_> when it comes to a number of human lives versus a number of alien lives, I would probably say, preserve the greater number; but it depends on what kind of minds these humans and aliens have. If the aliens have a swarm intelligence, with each alien being very simple but smart in concert, then one alien life is not worth one human life
[23:44:41] <arryana> to me that concept sounds like giving a two year old the obligation to 'protect' a bear.
[23:45:18] <causative_> or it could be that the alien intelligence is much greater and wiser than that of humans, and then it might take many human lives to morally equal one alien life
[23:46:03] <evolv> I_Am_M00t, the end of Revolutions when Neo finally gives up to Smith is symbolic for how our own perceptions, beliefs, ideas control ourselves. In the case of trans-people, the internal struggle between expectation of reality, the body, and what is felt, the mind. The inner struggle, like Neo and Smith fighting. But acceptance of what is true to the heart ends the struggle - Neo relinquishes fighting, thus control
[23:46:04] <causative_> but we wouldn't want either species to ever be wiped out entirely, because that would be a loss of a great many possibilities for finding truth; different species would have different and valuable perspectives on the universe

[23:48:20] <shea> I see this unqualified adherence to truth as to be perverse, and it does not take an over-active imagination to see how such adherence could be used to justify unspeakable atrocities. In my mind, to value human life less than whatever one sees as being truth might lead to evil outcomes.
