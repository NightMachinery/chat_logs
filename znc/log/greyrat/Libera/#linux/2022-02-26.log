[01:04:32] <uwharrie> vaio: define "correct order"
[01:04:40] <Dagmar> vaio: `ls` generally _sorts_ filenames by default.  THey are not stored in the directory in alphabetical order.
[01:04:52] <vaio> uwharrie: i'd expect it to copy file01 then file02, file03, etc
[01:05:00] <vaio> Dagmar: ah, okay
[01:05:09] <phogg> vaio: the order will be the order you provide the files to the command. If you are using a glob it will be the order the glob expanded in, which is up to your shell.

[01:28:44] <chilversc> when something says "mount a block device", is that different to the standard mount command to mount a formatted file system such as ext3?
[01:28:50] <phogg> Dagmar: at least one more, as always ms. swan
[01:28:51] <johnjaye> if i want to remove every line from a file after the = character is that a job for sed, awk, or perl?
[01:28:55] <Dagmar> chilversc: Nah
[01:29:02] <gjvc> chilversc: no
[01:29:05] <phogg> johnjaye: sed
[01:29:10] <phogg> johnjaye: perl is fine too
[01:29:20] <johnjaye> chilversc: no block device is just a name for hard drive like devices you would see in /dev. including formatted file systems
[01:29:26] <johnjaye> in fact i don't think you can mount an unformatted file system
[01:29:30] <Dagmar> You can't
[01:29:31] <johnjaye> mount demands you tell it a format
[01:29:35] <Dagmar> Not really.
[01:29:42] <johnjaye> it assumes one if you don't iirc
[01:29:46] <johnjaye> but i haven't read the code
[01:29:54] <Dagmar> You can just give it the filesystem type of 'auto' and it'll generally figure things out on it's own
[01:29:58] <phogg> johnjaye: sed -e 's/=.*/=/' will remove them, but the file won't change. You must use -i to replace it after, or use > tmpfile; mv tmpfile "$original"
[01:30:09] <johnjaye> ok
[01:30:14] <chilversc> ok, its just apparently the difference between CacheFS and CacheFiles, is "CacheFS permits a block device to be mounted and used as a cache", while "CacheFiles is a cache rooted in a directory in an already mounted filesystem"
[01:30:17] <phogg> johnjaye: I like ed scripts for this kind of thing because they can actually edit in place
[01:30:22] <hexnewbie> An unformated filesystem is a bit like an unconceived human, there's no such thing
[01:30:31] <chilversc> which really doesn't help me know if I'm using CacheFiles or CacheFS
[01:30:43] <johnjaye> phogg: well maybe if you were already using ed i could see that. but either way you're calling a prgoram

[01:44:09] <Dagmar> The problem with remote work is that brake lines are so much harder to get at
[01:44:25] <phogg> python is *harder* to read because they don't allow delimiters that would let you pick up visual context, and they have so much magic going on it's hard to follow
[01:44:33] <Psi-Jack> phogg: It's not a myth... When I've seen it first hand myself.
[01:44:34] <phogg> perl is much easier: sigils everywhere, magic is isolated

[01:45:44] <Psi-Jack> phogg: Not really. Most decent editors these days have indent markers.
[01:45:49] <Dagmar> I like that you can say both "do that if this" and "if this then do that"

[01:46:24] <johnjaye> but are they equivalent
[01:46:36] <johnjaye> or is it like C where while {} and do {} while behave differently
[01:46:37] <Dagmar> Granted I do sometimes wish the parser were a little _less_ flexible
[01:46:38] <phogg> everyone I know in meatspace who knows python and a non-zero number of other languages either hates or is indifferent to python.

[02:41:17] <mikes1988> Apologies if this should be asked in somewhere like #systemd, please let me know... I've a number of services that I've configured as .service units - things like database broker, background scripts for the application, and have then created .target units as kind of "wrapper" units - the idea being our admins can run things like `systemctl stop $app-all.target` to bring down the whole application. This
[02:41:23] <mikes1988> works perfectly, however we have some backup scripts which are stopping the target, but this seems to be an asynchronous operation - the .services are getting stopped but systemctl stop doesn't wait for this to complete. Is there a way to make operations on the $app-all.target units synchronous? I can see options to make operations on the services be "non-blocking", but that's kind of the opposite of
[02:41:29] <mikes1988> what I want...

[04:51:17] <naptastic> "could not resolve hostname" means there's not an entry in /etc/hosts for artstation and your internal DNS isn't set up right. (It's ok; almost no one gets internal DNS right.)
[04:51:39] <FuriousGeorge> however, some of the memory is kept buffered....  so by the second pass, rather than freeing all the buffered ram to prevent swapping, the system begins to swap

[06:56:43] <Dagmar> ablyss: If you don't know then perhaps you shouldnt try to pass judgment

[09:45:59] <mlu> ditto
[09:46:06] <mlu> but sometimes, I use gedit and even VSCode
[09:46:11] <mlu> the question is: what kind of pro are you?
[09:46:21] <mlu> if you are a pro sysadmin, vi is plenty sufficient
[09:46:22] <jb1277976> mlu: i just follow guides 0_o
[09:46:30] <jim> the best thing is, you should use the editor you like the best
[09:46:39] <mlu> if you are a pro coder, you better have a nice debug flow -- that usually means VSCode or similar
[09:46:53] *** _filename is now known as filename
[09:46:56] <KBar> use gnu ed
[09:46:59] <mlu> but most importantly: pros just use tools that work for them so they get things done :)

[15:28:28] <f843d0> jjakob: MrElendig: nowadays you could avoid containers. Or at least privileged ones. Maybe going for flatpak / snap / systemd portable services would grant much less risks
[15:29:30] <zulc22> so yeah basically if nothing bothers me about running my server on arch there's no compelling reason i wouldn't know of to use something else yeah?
[15:29:36] <jjakob> f843d0: right, but the nature of most software means it's ever evolving. which means the devs may want to use some new features, which depend on newer versions of packages, and so on
[15:29:47] <MrElendig> f843d0: snap are basically less secure containers  so...
[15:30:17] <MrElendig> and flatpak is not usable for services, its designed for user interactive applications
[15:30:29] <jjakob> the problem is in the delivery methods, not in the containment solutions usually

[15:31:41] <jjakob> a delivery method where you rely on a 3rd party to package the whole image with all dependencies, configure it securely (which is sometimes not even done in official docker hub images) isn't good

Doesn't happen all the time but a good 30% of the time I tried to write to SD cards across two separate

[23:51:15] <hexnewbie> Then why did kings wear crowns made of gold to protect themselves from alien spies reading their minds?
[23:51:38] <rascul> to protect themselves from alien spies reading their minds
[23:51:53] <rascul> copper and silver have little spy protection

[23:53:43] <Dagmar> Not any more than what you tell tc to add
[23:54:10] <Dagmar> There's not a lot of intermediate steps in those compuations.

[23:54:21] <horseface> i used my exit sequence on mg as entropy for encrypting my external disk ayecee.
[23:54:26] <horseface> it worked very well.

[23:54:36] <Dagmar> It's mainly just walking a list doing ANDs and XORs looking for a match, so... anything under 10,000-20,000 rules isn't likely to even be easily measurable

[23:55:08] <rascul> is it before or after 12?
[23:55:19] <Dagmar> I've got more rules than that in my service firewall and it doesn't add 1ms latency

[23:55:28] <hexnewbie> I don't think tc was ever *walking* the lists, unlike iptables
[23:56:04] <Dagmar> List or tree doesn't really matter.  The point is that it's ridiculously fast because it's not a complex operation
[23:56:08] <rascul> does it run the list instead?
[23:56:12] <horseface> before.
[23:56:15] <horseface> no
