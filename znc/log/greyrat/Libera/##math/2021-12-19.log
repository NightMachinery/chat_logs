[00:00:07] <Z-module> BaruchSpinoza: 90 degrees = pi/2 radians.  In math that isn't for engineering, trig functions mostly use radians.
[00:00:11] <loadedanvils> BaruchSpinoza: Do you know how cosine works in a triangle?
[00:00:27] <BaruchSpinoza> all I know is adjacent / hypotenuse
[00:00:58] <BaruchSpinoza> yes I know it's 90 degrees but cos (x) can be anything
[00:01:04] <BaruchSpinoza> no idea why it's 90 degrees
[00:01:06] <Z-module> this is *the* cosine function
[00:01:18] <Z-module> whose first positive zero is at pi/2
[00:01:35] <loadedanvils> Ok. Take a look at a unit circle. If you draw a line from the origin to any point on the circle you’ll get a right triangle with the x and y axes.

[00:02:33] <BaruchSpinoza> oh so they just want me to assume x = pi/2 basically
[00:04:40] <Z-module> You need to see the graph of f(x) = cos(x) and the entire interval [0, 2pi]. It has it max value 1 at x = 0 and also x = 2pi, and it "midline" value 0 and x = pi/2 and x = 3pi/2
[00:04:54] <Z-module> and its min value -1 at x = pi
[00:07:09] <BaruchSpinoza> yeah, on desmos it has a point at pi/2,0
[00:07:15] <BaruchSpinoza> and max point at 0,1

[00:07:32] <BaruchSpinoza> trying to understand why but I don't
[00:11:01] <Z-module> To find cos(t) for *any* real t:  Start with the unit circle centered at (0,0). Put a pen at the point (1,0) (the easternmost point of that circle). Now, trace out along that circle for an arc length of exactly t (the full circle itself has length 2 pi), where positive t means counterclockwise. Whererever you land after that is some point (x,y), and this x is cos(t), this y is sin(t), by definition.
[00:12:02] <Z-module> If t is pi/2, that length along that circle is exactly a quarter-circle going counterclockwise, so after going there, you land on the point (0,1).  0 = cos(pi/2), 1 = sin(pi/2).
[00:12:25] <somiaj> BaruchSpinoza: do you know any calculus?
[00:12:39] <BaruchSpinoza> I get it now, basically it's just graphed. I was confused for some reason.
[00:12:45] <BaruchSpinoza> the pi/2 is just the x value
[00:13:15] <BaruchSpinoza> I don't know any calculus yet but I'm going to be taking pre-calc. I haven't studied trig for a whole year now so I'm a bit rusty lol
[00:13:39] <Guest7825> somiaj some of my classes have been, essentially, mastery based which I have enjoyed.
[00:15:05] <somiaj> BaruchSpinoza: I was just going to give another reason why radians are prefered in math, but in short radians give a relationship between the angle and the arclength along the unit circle as Z-module describe. And there are many useful reasons (that are more apparent with some calculus) to masure angles in terms of arc-length
[00:15:26] <Z-module> A big such reason is to get  sin' = cos
[00:15:58] <somiaj> Guest7825: Yea, I think it is a good system. Though I think semesters are a bit to long, mastery tests should happen about once a month, and if you don't pass them you redo the info. I find often people get thorugh courses without learning some key concepts, and I think they would do better slowing down.
[00:16:21] <somiaj> Z-module: yup, that was the reason I was going to use

[00:53:26] <Guest7825> I can write what ||Au||_2 is...but what am I taking the max of?
[00:53:54] <somiaj> isn't ||A|| = max ||Ax|| on the unit circle?
[00:54:17] <Guest7825> uh
[00:54:29] <somiaj> well Av = (v1 + v2, v1 - 2v2)

[00:54:49] <somiaj> well max of ||Av||
[00:55:27] <Guest7825> yeah. Dunno how I find the max of that
[00:55:58] <somiaj> so for (a) you want max{ max{ 2|v1 + v2|, 3|v1 - 2v2| } such that max{ 2|v1|, 3|v2| } = 1
[00:57:19] <somiaj> well if max { 2|v1|, 3|v2| } = 1 then you have two cases, I) |v1| = 1/2 and |v2| < 1/3 or II) |v2| = 1/3 and |v1| < 1/2

[01:00:25] <Guest7825> oh yeah in the exercise they wanted this weird weighted norm
[01:00:35] <somiaj> But usually ||A|| = max{ ||Av|| : ||v|| = 1 }, you need to use the same norm in both cases
[01:00:46] <Guest7825> yes that's right

[01:03:50] <Guest7825> so I wrote ||Au||_2 = ((u1 + u2)^2 + (u1 - 2u2)^2)^(1/2).
[01:03:51] <Guest7825> I am confused because max{} kinda means I'll be comparing more than the one value...
[01:04:26] <somiaj> well it seems to me that ||Au||_2 would use these other norms, they are asking for ||A|| not ||A||_2
[01:04:52] <Guest7825> I think I do not understand the definition of ||A||
[01:05:36] <somiaj> ||A|| = max ||Au|| where ||u|| = 1, note ||Au|| and ||u|| need to use the same norm
[01:05:48] <somiaj> basically it is the max of the outputs on the unit circle
[01:05:53] <Guest7825> Let's use the 2-norm.
[01:06:15] <Guest7825> ( I don't know anything about this unit circle )
[01:06:31] <somiaj> Okay, in the 2-norm, ||A||_2 = max{ sqrt( (u1+u2)^2 + (u1 - 2u2)^2 ), u1^2 + u2^2 = 1 }
[01:06:43] <somiaj> well unit circle just means ||u|| = 1 no matter what norm you are using
[01:07:16] <Guest7825> Why did you write u1^2 + u2^2 = 1 ?
[01:07:27] <somiaj> because that is easier to work with than square rooting it
[01:07:34] <somiaj> that is equivlant to ||u||_2 = 1
[01:07:47] <Guest7825> I thought we would write  ||A||_2 = max{ sqrt( (u1+u2)^2 + (u1 - 2u2)^2 )}
[01:08:12] <somiaj> It isn't the max over all vectors u, only vectors u on the unit circle, such that ||u||_2 = 1
[01:08:16] <Z-module> You can think of ||A|| as the ||-measured diameter of the image of the unit ball under the map A.
[01:08:50] <somiaj> in general max over all vectors doesn't exist, because of how the norm honors scalar multiplication
[01:09:04] <somiaj> but the max on the unit circle does exist, hence why the norm is restricted to just the unit circle (ball)
[01:09:13] <Guest7825> I know its only vectors u s.t. ||u||_2 = 1, but the definition says max{||Au||_2 such that ||u||_2 = 1}
[01:09:24] <Z-module> Hmm, I forget, if that closed unit ball isn't compact and A is bounded, does ||Au|| actually achieve its sup value over the unit ball, every time?
[01:09:46] <somiaj> well ||u||_2 = sqrt( u_1^2 + u_2^2 ) = 1, which is equivlant to saying u_1^2 + u_2^2 = 1
[01:10:19] <somiaj> Z-module: I think there is some equivlancies about when it obtains it max and related to bounded operators, though I forget the details.
[01:10:20] <Guest7825> I understand that. I do not understand why you are putting it inside max{}. We're not maximizing ||u||_2 = 1.
[01:10:34] <Guest7825> Only ||Au||_2 is inside max{}
[01:10:36] <somiaj> Guest7825: setbuilder notation { objects : conditions }

[01:13:11] <somiaj> understandable, I just missed what you were confused about
[01:13:29] <Guest7825> hm, but now how to maximize ?
[01:13:50] <somiaj> well use your restriction then some calclus should work
[01:13:59] <Z-module> yes Guest7825, take the original unit sphere S = { v : ||v|| = 1 }, now take the image of S under A, and find the max length of any vector in this image. Same thing as working with the ball { v : ||v|| <= 1 } instead of the sphere, because of  ||rv|| = |r| ||v||   for all scalars r, all vectors v
[01:14:44] <Z-module> well, the sup of all those lengths; not sure the max has to actually occur in general. (It does when the space is finite-dimensional so that the closed unit ball is compact)
[01:15:32] <somiaj> (u1 + u2)^2 + (u1 - 2u2)^2 = u1^2 + 2u1u2 + u2^2 + u1^2 - 4u1u2 + 4u2^2 = 3u2^2 - 2u1u2 + 2 = 3u2^2 - 2u2sqrt(1-u2)^2 + 2 -- and you find the max of that with traditional methods
[01:16:56] <Guest7825> yeah I just did that algebraic expansion https://i.imgur.com/iS8ig02.png well you did a little more it seems
[01:17:00] <somiaj> since you know -1 <= u2 <= 1, but the extreme value theorem that has a maximum value
[01:21:32] <Guest7825> thanks for the help on this exercise. Z-module Yeah, thats how they get this figure: https://i.imgur.com/wivgVuf.png

[03:36:21] <somiaj> I was just pointing out that sequence of partial sums is useful in other context, but really you are just taking a sequence a_n and creating a new sequence s_n called the sequence of paritial sums with s_n = sum_{i=0}^n a_i

[04:59:44] <pendarsoheil> So wouldn't take make the coordinates with respect to the sphere 1,0,0?
[04:59:51] <pendarsoheil> that*
[05:00:25] <pendarsoheil> Intuitively I would think it would be 1,0,Z where Z is < 1 and > 0.7 or something like that
[05:01:09] <somiaj> nope a sphere of radius 1 would require that z=0
[05:01:49] <somiaj> because <x,y,z> is on the surface of a sphere of radius 1 if x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1^2. (1,0,0) is the only point with x=1 on the surface of that sphere

[06:03:06] <Guest7825> if I'm right then I'll feel bad for being so dumb

[06:10:23] <Guest7825> agh I give up. I'll write my quest
[06:11:22] <Guest7825> How is the Gram-Schmidt procedure written as a triangular orthogonalization process for a matrix A?

[06:17:35] <Guest7825> Consider the matrix A = [w1 w2 w3] where w1, w2, and w3 form a basis. The G-S process says: we wish to construct an orthonormal basis u1, u2, u3. We know: span(w1,w2,w3) = span(u1,u2,u3) and therefore may write each w-vector as a linear combination of u1,u2, u3. Write:
[06:17:36] <Guest7825> w1 = r11 u1,
[06:17:36] <Guest7825> w2 = r12 u1 + r22 u2,
[06:17:37] <Guest7825> w3 = r13 u1 + r23 u2 + r33 u3.
[06:17:37] <Guest7825> Each coefficient r_ij may be obtained via the orthogonality constraint: r_ij = <w_j, u_i>, for each i = 1,2,..., j-1. Set r_11 = ||w_1|| => u_1 = w_1 / r_11.
[06:17:38] <Guest7825> APPARENTLY, the G-S process may be viewed as SUCCESSIVELY ORTHOGONALIZING THE COLUMNS OF A as: A * R1 * R2 * R3 = Q.
[06:17:38] <Guest7825> What are R1, R2, and R3 ?
[06:18:35] <Guest7825> I tried: R1 = [1 / r11; I] = [1/r11 0 0 ; 0 1 0; 0 0 1]. This gives me the first component of u1, but after this I'm stuck
[06:19:16] <Guest7825> I note that the three equations are exactly A = QR written out explicitly
[06:20:02] <Guest7825> So I feel like these matrices we are multiplying by on the Right of A are inverses of parts of R]

[17:48:12] <Guest145> Right
[17:49:01] <isekaijin> The problem is that arbitrary real powers of a negative number don't make any sense, at least if you confine yourself to the real numbers.

[18:25:05] <sonny> ok ... guess I'll just have to keep practising
[18:25:11] <[itchyjunk]> Out of context, math symbols mean very little imho.
[18:29:24] <cherim> There is a modern standard that the sequence is (a_n)_n, and the element is a_n. One of the ugliest accepted conventions I think

[18:40:55] <riv> a is the sequence, a_n is the element :)
[18:41:34] <sonny> hmm, that could get confusing quickly
[18:42:11] <riv> how is that confusing? it is just a function N -> R
[18:42:23] <riv> you could even write a(n) rather than a_n
[18:42:30] <cherim> I think older books freely used "sequence a_n" alongside with "element a_n" and there no problems because people tried to give enough context
[18:43:27] <cherim> There were also books which used {a_n} not bothering to start a polemic with Bourbakists who'd note {} is for sets
[18:44:08] <cherim> I also like the observation by Lamport in his paper on structured proofs

[21:05:24] <mycroftiv> ive been hoping the categorical-sheaf translation of cohen forcing and its use of ultrafilter-quotient constructions provides a path to expressing the similar ultrafilter quotients used in large cardinal embeddings at measurable and above, in the context of type theory

[21:12:24] <OverCoder> hi
[21:12:37] <OverCoder> A country called sealand has an area of 0.004 km^2, which translates to 4000 m^2
[21:13:06] <OverCoder> Now, I wanted to imagine this, so at first I imagined a square that's 4000 meters in each dimension
[21:13:29] <OverCoder> Then I imagined a square that's 0.004 km in each dimension, but hey that's 4 meters in each dimension!
[21:13:32] <OverCoder> How does this work out?
[21:13:36] <biberao> i hope they have seals
[21:13:57] <somiaj> well if the square was 0.004 km in each direction than its area would be 0.004*0.004 = 0.00016 km^2
[21:14:01] *** Joins: slidercrank (~slidercra@user/slidercrank)
[21:14:35] <somiaj> basically you need the side of the square to be sqrt(0.004) = 0.02 km in each direction, which is 20 meters.
[21:15:03] <somiaj> because 0.02km * 0.02km = 0.004 km^2
[21:15:04] <biberao> funny my calculator
[21:15:19] <biberao> the sqrt(0.004) when i did it gave me 0.06
[21:15:20] <biberao> lol
[21:15:22] <somiaj> oh wait
[21:15:34] <somiaj> grr, I have one to few zeros....
[21:15:34] <biberao> i was like something weird goin on here
[21:15:38] <somiaj> I tried to do this in my head
[21:15:49] <biberao> same here but then went to the calculator
[21:16:21] <somiaj> ahh yea, since 0.02*0.02 moves the answer four decimal places not 3...bad mental math
[21:16:47] <biberao> ya its not right somiaj :D
[21:16:49] <somiaj> OverCoder: okay, besides I'm bad at the actual computation each side of the square has sqrt(0.004) approx 0.06324555 km, or 63m
[21:17:17] <biberao> to find each side we do the sqrt on the area value
[21:17:25] <biberao> somiaj: high five
[21:17:32] <OverCoder> ah
[21:17:41] <OverCoder> so square root the area to get dimension
[21:17:43] <OverCoder> yeah makes sense
[21:17:53] <biberao> yes
[21:17:57] <OverCoder> Thanks!

[22:22:14] <mycroftiv> exploring arxiv and wikipedia for mathematical ideas isnt so different in spirit although the actual feel of old paper under the fingers is something too, i have a pretty large print library but my eyesight is kind of poor nowadays
[22:22:56] <Z-module> For example, this from 1970:  There is a compact set X in R^3 that's a disjoint union of closed line segments [x_alpha, y_alpha], where the 3-dimensional measure m(X) > 0, but if you use only the open segments (x_alpha, y_alpha) instead, that set has measure 0. "All the measure is in the endpoints."     Measure is just *totally wack*, as we knew already.
[22:24:19] <mycroftiv> two-valued measures aka ultrafilters are my jam so im in full agreement
[22:24:43] <mycroftiv> the whole topic of measurable cardinals comes out of Ulam investigating measure concepts

[22:34:19] <Guest78> I'm assuming ||.|| is the 2-norm
[22:34:46] <somiaj> It is related to some inner product, here the standard dot product

[22:35:00] <somiaj> art ||v||^2 =v.v

[22:36:12] <Guest78> ohh okay. I wasn't careful enough
