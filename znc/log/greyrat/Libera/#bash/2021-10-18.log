[03:15:29] <clarkk> I want to write a bash script (or alias) that accepts as many process names as is passed as arguments, for top.  For example,  top -p `pgrep vmware-vmx` -p `pgrep kcompactd0`.  Is there a way to repeat the arguments part like this?

[05:26:22] <e36freak> or as stated, do obase first and you won't run into this weirdness
[05:26:22] <akoana> loganlee: gnu bc supports variable names with more than 1 letter, so it might be useful to define your bases before in decimal, like for example   myibase=16; myobase=8; ibase=myibase; obase=myobase ...
[05:26:43] <akoana> to avoid confusion :)
[05:27:04] <loganlee> ok cool :D
[05:28:31] <akoana> for non gnu bc you might use i and o
[05:30:28] <kurahaupo> loganlee:  ibase=16 takes immediate effect and changes the meaning of the next ibase=16

[08:51:35] <sybariten> I have an opml file, an xml file, that looks like this   https://pastebin.com/ZmHt1rmt    how could i iterate over it, and do something for each "outline" row / element, but with two variables? Namely the xmlurl and the title
[08:51:36] <pasteban> Paste is available without ads on https://pastebin.com/raw/ZmHt1rmt
[08:52:57] <sybariten> in other words, i would like to iterate over that file and do soemthing like echo "The url is $xmlurl" ; echo "and the title is $title"
[08:55:41] <sybariten> what i have managed to do is to query just the urls or just the titles by doing something like cat bnlabla.xml | xmlstarlet sel -t -v "//@xmlUrl"

[14:25:45] <clarkk> Soliton, it's definitely not perfect, but I have control over the input (it's only me using it on my local host).  What I would like to know is how to get the exit code of pgrep in the if block
[14:26:21] <Soliton> your if is using it.
[14:26:54] <clarkk> Soliton, it was before, and it didn't work
[14:26:58] <clarkk> hold on
[14:27:17] <Soliton> that is what if does. it runs the given commands and checks the exit code.
[14:27:38] <clarkk> what is the variable to use in the if block to get the exit code of pgrep in the test condition?
[14:27:58] <jetchisel> !$?
[14:27:58] <greybot> The special parameter ? (expanded by $?) holds the exit status of the last synchronous command.
[14:28:15] <Soliton> $? but if you mean the then block then it's not the exit code of pgrep but ! pgrep.
[14:28:33] <Soliton> so don't run ! pgrep if you want the exit code of pgrep.

[14:33:36] <eoli3n_> when setting new IFS, why should we prefix with "$" like IFS=$'\n' ?
[14:33:44] <earnestly> Soliton: They may need to know that some implementation detail of ptop used a tool that ran out of memory, and then make the user guess that from the message which doesn't refer to the tool in question

[14:34:02] <greybot> eoli3n_: bash has a special form of quoting, $'string' in which backslash-character combinations are expanded. For example, IFS=$' \t\n' or echo $'It\'s embedded!' http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes

[19:35:52] <Soliton> so maybe you're trying to remove carriage return.

[19:49:57] <thelounge4451> is there any other alternative to store commands output to variable ? $() is not working for me, cuz i am using this libary https://github.com/mvdan/sh , and $() is internaly used to evaluete bash expressions
[19:49:57] <Soliton> what issue?
[19:49:58] <gajus> https://github.com/google/zx/issues/242#issuecomment-945943126
[19:50:02] <gajus> well, that's one workaround
[19:50:47] <HumanG33k> i guess local bash (ssh) load all stuff before send ?
[19:50:59] <Soliton> what?

[19:51:24] <Soliton> bash and the file are on the remote.
[19:51:37] <Soliton> do you want a local file to magically appear on the remote?
[19:52:04] <Soliton> i guess you want: ssh user@host 'su username -c bash' < alocalfile

[20:00:41] <emanuele6> Soliton: but if you source, your error checking code will be run. if you don't, your error checking code will be the input for your commands that should fail
[20:02:06] <Soliton> yes, it's nicer failure behaviour. however if you come up with that you're probably also capable of understanding that the whole approach is not going to work.
[20:02:39] <HumanG33k> me ?
[20:03:16] <Soliton> that was for emanuele6. yes the design comment was ironic.
[20:03:46] <HumanG33k> ok, but i try to make my code can be easily maintain
[20:04:24] <HumanG33k> and gitify without including secrets
[20:04:46] <Soliton> i would suggest to stop using su for one.
[20:05:10] <Soliton> if you must use sudo. or just let the caller decide.
[20:05:48] <HumanG33k> the caller ?
[20:05:53] <Soliton> if the whole thing is in git then just check it out on the remote.

[23:53:49] <gajus> `tee` suffers from the same issue that I am trying to workaround ... it does not log the full output of a program.

[23:56:21] <gajus> if you run this program you will see that output is cut off before everything is written to stdout

[23:59:12] <greycat> gajus: do you want the program's stdout *and* stderr logged?  Then you must do this:   foobar 2>&1 | tee logfile
[23:59:40] <gajus> greycat: I just want full output include "end" logged
