[00:02:45] <b0nn> Actually, I suppose you could do the Less function with a type switch inside, to determine if one or both values need conversion
[00:03:53] <b0nn> With generics you'd have to have four options, both to be converted, only i to be converted, only j to be converted, neither to be converted
[00:03:54] *** Joins: paulgrmn__ (~paulgrmn@user/paulgrmn)
[00:05:28] <b0nn> but, even then, you need to have a slice that is capable of holding both types simultaneously, because part way through the conversion process there will be elements of each type
[00:06:17] *** Quits: casionaut (~casionaut@user/casionaut) (Quit: o7)
[00:06:23] <fizzie> Depending on how exactly you interpret "in the same step", a function that does something like iterate over a slice and do an insertion sort (sure, it's O(n^2), but maybe it's a small slice) to build up the result slice in sorted order might count as doing that. And only needs a comparison function implementation for the result type of the conversion, of course.
[00:08:41] <mrus> I see
[00:09:16] <b0nn> hmm it might be worse than O(n^2) because each new insertion effectively starts anew
[00:09:34] <fizzie> Not sure what that's supposed to mean.
[00:11:06] <b0nn> hang on, smoke alarm has just informed me that breakfast is ready
[00:13:48] <fizzie> Anyway, you could imagine other combinations of a sort algorithm and a conversion too. Like for a quicksort doing the converting of elements as part of the first partitioning step, and doing the rest of the quicksort on the converted values. Though it's a valid question if there's really a meaningful way that's "in the same step".
[00:17:28] <b0nn> I'd go the convert/move step O(n), followed by Quicksort (note that Go's Quicksort implementation is slow ) O9n log n)

[04:22:44] <jemaclus> Hello, happy holidays, etc. Quick question: I host my webserver on a DigitalOcean droplet. Right now I deploy using SCP, but that's not really a blue/green deploy. I'd ideally like to implement a CI/CD pipeline to do a blue/green deploy... is that possible with a DO Droplet? Any resources anyone can point me to?

[04:25:14] <jemaclus> n-st: most of the stuff I've seen is focused on Ruby or Python or Java and installing dependencies and Docker and so on, and I guess I just wanted something Go-specific, since I'm really just building a binary and deploying that. But if there's a better place to ask, I'm happy to go there...
[04:25:19] <jemaclus> b0nn: Thanks
[04:27:12] <b0nn> It looks like you need two droplets and a load balancer - then one droplet is blue, one is green, pointing the load balancer at the right one is the switch
[04:27:49] <jemaclus> yeah, that makes sense.
[04:29:22] <jemaclus> I understand the basic concept of blue/green, just am not sure how to go about setting up with a CI/CD pipeline (say, Github Actions or something). But I think this is enough to get me started. Thanks for pointing me in this direction.
[04:39:40] <b0nn> hmm, I wonder how you'd do that, your CI/CD system has to be able to determine which of the droplets is to be updated with the new version, then, once the code is installed/running, it needs to tell the LB to switch over
[04:40:23] <jemaclus> No idea... I've never built something like this. But I know companies do it all the time, so it must be doable
[04:40:24] <b0nn> I /guess/ that you could say "Start a new droplet, install code, switch the LB to it, then, if nobody screams, kill the old one"
[04:41:39] <mfiano> b0nn: Have you benchmarked Timsort? I heard a few PL's use this internally as a "better" alternative to Quicksort, but I haven't ever looked into it.

[21:24:49] <aaaaa> is there a way i can use an [...]int32 as a [...*4]byte if i don't care about endianness? it seems the binary package iterates over the members, but i think i should be able to avoid that given the array should be all in order in memory?
