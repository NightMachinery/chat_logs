[10:55:10] <biberu> akronymus[m]: are you often working with something that doesn't support hofs?
[10:55:35] <akronymus[m]> Not even function pointers, as far as I can tell.
[10:55:47] <biberu> what language is that?

[10:55:55] <akronymus[m]> PAIN

[10:57:22] <akronymus[m]> Oh, apparently it does.
[10:57:33] <akronymus[m]> But only when abusing events.
[10:57:44] <biberu> verbose :o
[11:23:51] <xeno> akronymus[m]: I was there  a 2 digit number of years back, and then I had to work and none of the common industry languages had them. sucked horribly :/
[11:23:57] <xeno> (HoF that is) 
[11:24:55] <xeno> unless you did perl, but that's not an option

[14:13:45] <akronymus[m]> LISP though xeno 
[14:14:36] <akronymus[m]> Hell, algol had it afair
[14:14:49] <xeno> well, good luck getting a job programming lisp - and if you do, not getting brain damage by knocking your head into your desk when you see what your coworkers do with it
[14:14:57] <xeno> it did? 
[14:15:10] <stenno> lol algol
[14:16:03] <xeno> looked it up, algol had it halfway
[14:16:05] * kuribas has a lisp job
[14:16:14] <xeno> you could send functions as arguments, but not return them
[14:16:34] <xeno> kuribas: how does your desk look? dented? 
[14:16:49] <kuribas> no, it's flat
[14:17:14] <kuribas> I miss static types though...
[14:17:35] <xeno> yeah
[14:18:22] <stenno> my dad told me that algol 86 is the most difficult programming language
[14:18:32] <stenno> but he also stopped coding in the early 80s so
[14:18:40] <stenno> algol 68
[14:18:48] <kuribas> lispers have a tendency to create new languages, but often that doesn't improve legibility
[14:19:01] <stenno> lol
[14:19:58] <kuribas> it can be useful if done well.
[14:20:21] <xeno> I love DSL's - but unfortunately making ones requires a functioning brain, and most programmers lacks that :/
[14:20:53] <kuribas> smart people can also make things too complicated.
[14:25:15] <kuribas> IMO a good language doesn't require new syntax to create a DSL.
[14:25:57] <xeno> I know, but people fail at anything resembling a DSL :/

[18:33:25] <indomitable> xeno, just look at ADSL
[18:33:27] <indomitable> totally failed
[18:33:53] <indomitable> kuribas, is a lisp job like a nosejob but for a lisp?
[18:34:33] <indomitable> akronymus[m], why are you working on progress?
[18:34:38] <indomitable> akronymus[m], I assume you're charging like a thousand dollars an hour?
[18:34:45] <indomitable> because you could probably get away with that :D
[18:35:25] <akronymus[m]> indomitable: Because work
[18:35:35] <akronymus[m]> indomitable: still learning it, so no.
[18:35:57] <indomitable> akronymus[m], why not work literally anywhere else for more money
[18:36:07] <indomitable> last i checked you weren't incompetent
[18:36:17] <indomitable> better enjoy that job man, if you're doing progress cheap for it...
[18:36:23] <akronymus[m]> I am actually pretty incompetent
[18:36:27] <indomitable> why
[18:36:34] <xeno> that btw reminds me - I've interviewed many candidates through the years, and one of the worst ones was a lisp programmer 
[18:36:58] <indomitable> xeno, can you hire akronymus[m], he can't be worse than any of your indians
[18:37:03] <xeno> but of course not really a programmer - he had just been told a number of patterns that he had to repeat as part of some ai training thing
[18:37:25] <akronymus[m]> wrong country
[18:37:26] <xeno> I probably can if he move to India first, so that we can follow company policy 
[18:37:33] <indomitable> akronymus[m], remote can pay ok these days
[18:37:33] <akronymus[m]> And no, i am not a good employee
[18:37:44] <indomitable> what qualifies a good employee
[18:37:50] <xeno> no worries, neither are most of the candidates 
[18:38:19] <akronymus[m]> not slacking off >90% of the time, to start with
[18:39:14] <indomitable> sounds like there's poor work tracking and management
[18:39:28] <indomitable> it's very hard to slack off 90% of the time when you've got new reasonably interesting tasks coming in regularly
[18:39:36] <indomitable> 20% of the time is expected
[18:40:00] <akronymus[m]> i can BS my way through most of it
[18:40:16] <indomitable> wouldn't be able to do that with me on your team at least
[18:40:25] <indomitable> but you might enjooy being lazy
[18:40:26] <indomitable> I hate it
[18:40:31] <akronymus[m]> and most programming isnt exciting
[18:40:41] <indomitable> got to make it exciting
[18:40:49] <indomitable> if you get "do some stupid thing stupidly" as a task, ofc you slack off
[18:40:57] <akronymus[m]> yeah make doing a form exciting
[18:41:05] <indomitable> sure
[18:41:09] <indomitable> in such a job I
[18:41:13] <indomitable> d just make myself obsolete
[18:41:17] <indomitable> and quit with glowing references
[18:41:52] <akronymus[m]> try it with literally 30 years of legacy
[18:43:58] <akronymus[m]> But all that doesnt excuse me being a shitty employee

[19:54:10] <indomitable> anything older than 15 years old is past saving
[19:54:26] <akronymus[m]> Fine. No linux for you
[19:54:58] <indomitable> linux isn't legacy, besides the parts that are, dammit. :p
[19:55:01] <indomitable> anyway, you don't work on linux
[19:55:10] <indomitable> you work on shitty closed source garbage written in a language only 100 people in the world grasp
