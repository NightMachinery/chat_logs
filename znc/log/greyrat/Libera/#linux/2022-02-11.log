[04:10:00] <derek-shnosh> Its globally disabled (OFF) in the system it seems, so apps don't see it as an option to use... so I suppose muting isn't necessary.

[06:43:18] <koo5_> Composite & Transform – this is a rather new transition that made its debut with Kdenlive 16.04. It allows to easily composite clips onto each other (supported several compositing modes), as well as to move the upper track clips. However, there is neither support for scaling, nor for rotation, but for dynamic opacity. But keyframes are supported. In those situations, use Affine or Cairo Affine Blend instead.

[07:17:44] *** Joins: s4d (~s4d@user/s4d)
[07:18:07] <auk> I'm wondering if that might be ameliorated by a combination of LVM thin provisioning, and hosting the loop dev img files on top of a CoW fs (e.g. btrfs)
[07:18:10] <ayecee> sounds like something i'd say
[07:18:20] <ayecee> auk: nope
[07:19:06] <auk> no?
[07:20:05] <auk> maybe i'm reasoning about this wrong, but basically the issue is that the more contiguous the loop img files are, the less continguous the "content" data files are
[07:20:08] <ayecee> nope. i don't think that would render file blocks as contiguous on disk, at least not in a way that they'd be read in a row.
[07:20:48] <auk> so if btrfs is hosting the loop imgs, then the img files should probably end up extremely fragmented
[07:21:21] <auk> which in this particular use-case is a good thing
[07:21:32] *** Joins: hB7drf (~quassel@user/hB7drf)

[07:41:15] <koo5_> Erasure coding increases data resiliency by breaking data (blocks, files or objects) into fragments, and then writing those fragments across multiple storage drives or nodes. Each fragment contains metadata about the other fragments, so that the original data can be rehydrated in the event of a drive or node failure, or in the event that a fragment becomes corrupted. For example, ten fragments may be written, but only eight may be required to rehydrate the

[09:07:16] <Gustavo6046> I think the lack of standardization is at least partially on par with the philosophy of being able to choose and mix and match.
[09:07:28] <Gustavo6046> Standardization, while it helps make a consistent experience, often stifles innovation.
[09:07:33] <Gustavo6046> And choice.

[09:10:22] <koo5_> yeah, gui apps that are just forms and standard controls could be completely described in a high level declarative way

[13:24:03] <bitplane> Hi. I have a microcontroller on a motherboard I'm using, can't see any information online and the manufacturer is in Taiwan - 8 hours time difference, I don't know how to get info about it. what tools do I have in Linux? I've looked in lspci but can't see anything. are there any useful next steps I can take?
[13:24:23] <bitplane> the machine is 60 miles away so I can't start poking about with it physically

[17:28:51] <kurahaupo> gurkenglas: you can get a rough estimate of the number of people who have poor security by looking at the total botnet participation. Typically 1E5 to 1E6 devices at any given time.
[17:29:04] <Gustavo6046> y'all stop taking notes on me, I know nothin about nothin!
[17:29:06] <iptable> gurkenglas does it matter how many lazy people get in trouble? from your perspective you should consider: does being lazy increase chances of getting in trouble? YES. Can I decrease these chances a lot by simply doing my job right? YES. Well, if you answered YES to both, then you should definitely ...

[17:30:10] <iptable> gurkenglas 10% simply means you will have to wait 2x longer than 20%, no? statistics do not matter when the question is "should I be lazy". answer is NO
[17:30:51] <gurkenglas> iptable, another relevant number is how much damage I take when I take damage, but I didn't ask for that one because I can estimate and limit it.
[17:30:54] <kurahaupo> gurkenglas: if a million devices sounds like a small percentage of the total number of people who have inadequate security, consider that that's just the devices incorporated into botnets *now*. Over the course of a year that population is rolled over many times.

[17:36:48] <gurkenglas> IceMichael: What do you mean? I have to enter it many times a day.

[17:44:42] <hexnewbie> I've guessed 13-letter passphrase with a 2 capitals and 1 number in it simply because I knew a friend of the person and I inferred it from the second try. So there is a varying definition of “simple” password.
[17:44:53] <gurkenglas> jim, for ludicrous overkill you can feed both strings to the CLIP model, which was trained to turn an image or text into a vector such that known image-label pairs are mapped as closely to each other as possible. thus, closeness between the vectors corresponding two texts is reasonably close to comparing their actual meaning
[17:45:01] <jim> yeah, that';s exactly the problem

[18:06:37] <stevenm_> In /etc/aliases is "default: some@email.address" a universally understood thing regardless of the MTA?  or is it just an msmtp thing?  (i.e. 'default: ' meaning... send anything that you didn't define in the aliases to the following address)
[18:06:38] <clamrhino> I think palindrome if you tried "set -x" it should quit upon failure, if that's what you're looking for.
[18:06:46] <peetaur> I'm not aware of any shell that has a proper throw,try,catch,finally implementation (or any implementation at all really)

[18:07:19] <labrador> Dagmar, trust me the combined one runs much better
[18:07:35] <palindrome> clamrhino: let me try it.
[18:07:41] <gurkenglas> if all passwords are random and 8 characters long and a copy of the password with 6 random characters scrambled is stored for closeness evaluation, and the attacker is told that his first random try had a key in common with the true password (~2/26 chance of this), then you'd think he has gained an advantage, but in fact he is in the same situation as if he had simply *assumed* that he has one character
[18:07:47] <gurkenglas> correct without asking the server. If you can ask yes/no questions about the password and getting any no answer loses you the game, you cant do better than guessing immediately. (Ignoring that 1. the attacker wastes less time if he knows early whether he lost 2. the user might have reused the password elsewhere and then the attacker has gained knowledge for attacking the user's other accounts)
[18:07:52] <Dagmar> It can run better all it likes.  The problem is the 10-20 hours a week spent _keeping_ it running or getting it there in the first place

[20:32:25] <Frost> and then used chainloader
[20:32:29] <Frost> it didnt work
[20:32:37] <Frost> it took me to pxe boot

[20:35:14] <omegatron> to "flash" a device usually means to change firmware ..  you surely simply copied data from one file/device to another file/device  !?  (just to get terms right)

[20:37:31] <koollman> well, you can. But you need to be pretty specific about the way it should boot, then :)
[20:37:42] <omegatron> yeah, and 'dd' copies data from one file/device to another ...  but to 'flash' something often means (if the device is a computer for example), to boot into bios configuration screen and then, somehow, do a firmware/bios update/change (nowadays usually from a usb drive)
[20:37:46] <Frost> mrfb : here lemme explain the basic way : i have an iso file i dont wanna use usb or dvd, so i extended my partition that runs xubuntu, then i flashed it just like you would do with a usb, then i used grub customizer to boot off of that partition
[20:37:46] <mrfb> into a partition? you can't

[20:39:23] <koollman> Frost: most likely, the systemrescuecd bootloader can't find its file
[20:39:26] <mrfb> also, you didn't flash anything because you are not changin the firmware

[20:41:21] <Frost> i even rebooted, grub and everything is there
[20:41:27] <omegatron> if you want to have a device/partition where to boot your pc from and then select (with grub for example) the OS to load, there are plenty of tutorials out there ..  (and besides, what does it mean, your usb has a virus?)
[20:41:59] <Frost> omegatron : no no, i dont have a usb virused, its just that i use win7 as a dualboot
[20:43:20] <guest> I got virus when I downloaded fake distro. I don't know how it got online but there it was
[20:43:59] <Frost> hmm lemme try ubuntu server

[23:56:45] <meator> I could close() STDOUT_FILENO of the child that will be execve()ing and then dup2() the write end of the pipe to STDOUT_FILENO, but that feels unnecessary. I don't need two file descriptors for the write end of the pipe in the child process. Can I just "move" it to STDOUT_FILENO?
