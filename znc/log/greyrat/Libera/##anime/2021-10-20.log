[07:23:16] <MootPoot> amigojapan: if nowhere in sailor moon it says that the moon is made out of water like you said; that means its made of cheese - raising my inital question again, how do you sail on cheese
[07:23:44] <Jigsy> Pretty sure you can sail in hot fondue.
[07:23:49] <Jigsy> Yeah, wrap your head around that.
[07:24:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it's not about sailing

[12:59:50] <Bco1981> movie and tv-series romcom... is cringe. but i practically can't get enough of anime romcom.
[13:00:35] <DunceCotus> the only correct answer to favourite anime is Naruto

[19:13:22] <Sadale> I only remember a few of them. Texas, the biggest one. California, the one with the most population. Florida, not sure what's so special about it. Alaska, the one that purchased from Russia. And Hawaii, the islands.
[19:13:30] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, oh lol
[19:13:49] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: also, I think maybe California or somewhere doesn't do that? For some reason most Californians don't seem to know that the state where I was born is even a state
[19:13:53] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, funny how it's taught in school and students are forced to memorize them
[19:14:14] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, oh. So which state is yours?
[19:14:24] <Sadale> which state you was borned in?
[19:14:29] * Sadale wonders if he knows about that state
[19:14:31] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: the special thing about Florida is whenever you see really fucking stupid stories in the news, they probably take place in florida

[19:15:47] <TsundereNoises> you're welcome
[19:15:52] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, ah. I haven't heard of it as well.
[19:16:31] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: yes, but you weren't supposed to be learning it in grade school
[19:16:38] <Sadale> true
[19:17:07] <Urchin[emacs]> hi TsundereNoises 
[19:17:08] <Sadale> I know the names of almost all Chinese provinces. But if I have to list them out one by one, I wouldn't be able to xD
[19:17:22] <Jigsy> Recite all of them in a quarter of a second.
[19:17:31] <Sadale> too much efforts
[19:17:59] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I don't know very many chinese provinces: Guangdong, Yunnan, Hunan, Sichuan (but don't know where it is) and is Inner Mongolia or something like that one?
[19:18:01] <Sadale> I really only need to know about the few big cities. Like Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai.
[19:18:10] <TsundereNoises> hi Urchin[emacs]
[19:18:36] <Bco1981> found that succubus girl from konosuba, for download.
[19:18:37] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I only know things if there's food or tea
[19:18:55] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, yep. yep. They're all Chinese provinces. Guangdong is the province that Hong Kong is a part of. Guangdong also has Guangzhou (Canton), Shenzhen and a few big cities.

[19:20:14] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, sichuan is known for its spicy food. It's spicy af
[19:20:27] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: yeah, seems like I mostly know about the south, and yes, because of tea and chinese food
[19:20:48] <TsundereNoises> and bits of books I guess, but I don't remember the settings of everything I read
[19:21:01] <Sadale> I think Sichuan is in central China. Inner Mongolia is in the far north.

[21:23:27] <MootPoot>  got a razer mouse for the basement
[21:23:41] <MootPoot> I wonder how well mice work on plastic tabletops
[21:23:53] <Bco1981> depends on the mouse
[21:30:10] <MootPoot> First razer product I've ever bought...better not be the last
[21:30:55] <Bco1981> i'm getting closer to trying a razor mouse, this second logitech mouse is already showing signs of double-click fault
[21:31:02] <Bco1981> and it's only a few months old
[21:31:22] <MootPoot> Everyone gets logi double
[21:31:24] <MootPoot> except me
[21:31:24] <Bco1981> have never had issues with logitech mice before
[21:31:25] <MootPoot> idk why
[21:31:34] <MootPoot> maybe its just the newer ones
[21:31:40] <Bco1981> i think so
[21:31:49] <MootPoot> I only use the mx master nad tha g600, both pretty old designs
[21:32:20] <MootPoot> brb\
[21:35:45] <Bco1981> this was the mouse i had before the double-clicky ones. https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDQwWDY5Ng==/z/NzMAAOSwVXRg4PzU/$_58.JPG

[22:04:56] <listen_ers> a perfect mouse is bound to fail
[22:05:30] <listen_ers> i use a logitech mouse from goodwill two bucks. 
[22:06:30] <listen_ers> im thinking a gamer gave it away because when it activates the infered it lags a tiny bit
[22:07:01] <Bco1981> sounds very plausible
[22:07:28] <listen_ers> it could use a deep polish where my hand is place on it
[22:07:36] <Bco1981> gamer or not i would do the same, working with a mouse that has delay would drive me crazy.
[22:07:58] <listen_ers> on the contrary its delve up the ranks when i spill ink water on my razer abyss

[22:40:47] <MootPoot> I just got my swiss army knife back from warrenty
[22:41:03] <MootPoot>  I can't tell if they just replaced random bits or the whole thing
[22:41:04] <MootPoot> lol
[22:41:48] <Roey> heh
[22:42:00] <Roey> they should be transparent about it, one would think
[22:42:22] <Roey> btw Poot was the name of one of the characters in The Wire
[22:42:24] <MootPoot> idk
[22:42:49] <MootPoot> They sent me a baggie with what looks to be a pile of the old parts from my knife what was worn
[22:43:11] <MootPoot> but not all of the parts
[22:43:33] <MootPoot> and some parts like hte magnifying glass lok completely different
[22:44:21] <Roey> ok
[22:44:24] <Roey> ah
[22:46:15] <MootPoot> Either way, feels like a mostly new knife now
[22:46:25] <MootPoot> sharpened enough that I can shave with it
[22:48:50] <Roey> aye

[22:49:15] <MootPoot> instead of 4k I have 14k
[22:49:16] <MootPoot> rip

[22:50:16] <MootPoot> hmm
[22:50:20] <MootPoot> If I play my cards right
[22:50:37] <MootPoot> I can pay off about 40% of that 
[22:50:39] <MootPoot> before december

[23:02:07] <Roey> MootPoot: ok. like.. as long as you have a job... put that sucker on the back burner.
[23:02:13] <Roey> pay as mjinimum as pssible
[23:02:28] <Nanobot> Either I just felt a little earthquake, or I'm a bit lightheaded.
[23:02:30] <Roey> the reason why is b/c with super-inflation that we're experiencing, that loan will get easier to pay off over time.
[23:02:46] <Roey> so don't let $14k go wooosh from your bank account in one go.
[23:03:00] <Roey> you can take that $14k and invest it in something that will earn more over time
[23:03:03] <MootPoot> well, I do live at home so dumping almost my entire salary into the loand is easy
[23:03:07] <MootPoot> but yeah I see your point
[23:03:13] <Roey> aye
[23:03:17] <Roey> I mean it's almost like free money
[23:03:40] <Roey> the fact that it's a govt subsidized loan means they're not looking to maximize profits off of your loan
[23:03:50] <Roey> it's the best deal you can get
[23:04:19] <name100> amigojapan fren
[23:04:34] <Roey> MootPoot: like let's say your loans are $200 a month.  What will $200 a month be, five years from now?
[23:04:46] <Roey> will be worth much less in money from five years from now.
[23:05:20] <Roey> MootPoot: that's why inflation is celebrity & rich folks' best friend, since the huge house loans they've taken are suddenly worth less $$.
