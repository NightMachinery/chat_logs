[01:51:37] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: On average, the life cycle of a house fly only lasts for around 30 days, which means they don’t live for long at all.However, in their short lifetime, they manage to accomplish quite a lot. House flies can lay up to 500 eggs in their lifetime which are usually in batches of around 75 to 150. So, although they don’t live long, an infestation can quickly arise through new generations.

[01:52:34] <mistiry> lol
[01:52:38] <mistiry> !flyfact
[01:52:38] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Studies show that theres a specific region within the eyes of a male fly called the love spot. It is pretty much used for detecting and chasing female flies. This spot is located within the dorsofrontal region of their eyes. This is typically used to detect small target motion, however, males also use it to stay locked onto potential mates during aerial pursuit.

House flies like the food we eat. When a fly lands on your lunch, it vomits on the food. Acids in the vomit dissolve the food so the fly can suck it up. Disgusting!

[02:39:00] <MarsSpiral> how do you reconcile your imposter syndrome with a raise 
[02:40:05] <Kiernian> the thing to remember is that sometimes you're a good fit because, while faking it, you're still managing to actually DO what's required of the job role and perhaps more, while someone else faking it might not get that far.
[02:41:41] <PattyCakes> ^ truth right there
[02:42:05] <PattyCakes> are you getting told you're doing things wrong all the time? Are you actively worried about getting fired because of your screw ups? No?
[02:42:08] <PattyCakes> you deserve a raise
[02:43:54] <MarsSpiral> well
[02:44:08] <MarsSpiral> i just lack self confidence in general and constantly think im incompetent 
[02:44:26] <MarsSpiral> management says im doing a good job and rewards me for it and i feel good maybe for like a week
[02:44:32] <MarsSpiral> then i go back into my old way of thinking
[02:44:51] <Hobadee> MarsSpiral: Well, are you incompetent?
[02:45:09] <MarsSpiral> maybe
[02:45:17] <MarsSpiral> but i guess not cause i got a big raise
[02:45:37] <Hobadee> MarsSpiral: Do you accomplish your assigned tasks within the expected timeframe?
[02:46:03] <MarsSpiral> well the thing about that, we plan our projects by quarter and almost everytime a few projects ends up getting pushed to the next quarter
[02:46:16] <MarsSpiral> everything else sure
[02:46:46] <Hobadee> MarsSpiral: Congratulations!  You aren't incompetent!  If you were incompetent you wouldn't be accomplishing things.
[02:47:06] <Hobadee> MarsSpiral: Now your level of competence is still to be determined, but you aren't incompetent.  :-P
[02:47:11] <MarsSpiral> lol good to get some external validation 
[02:47:21] <MarsSpiral> honestly I like this place, but I'm thinking of leaving for a 99% wfh position. would def lose a decent amount of money tho
[02:48:13] <MarsSpiral> i was actually planning on leaving for sure before i got the raise and bonus and now im not sure.. just waiting on the job offer from the new company
[02:49:21] <MarsSpiral> guess ill just have to weigh how much of a paycut im willing to take for wfh
[02:55:02] <fritzwastaken> Sounds like this MarsSpiral just needs to git fucking gud and stfu

[08:44:42] <Cl0udNinja> it got put to a stop after someone tried to outdo another person and put a cartoon dickpic
[08:44:43] <xe0n> imagine having a group policy that handles that stuff
[08:44:44] <xe0n> lol
[08:44:59] <Kiernian> It is entirely possible. Oh man, that must have happened after my time. I left that MSP in 2014
[08:45:01] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> I mean, I had to remove it from the group policy to get the background to stick
[08:45:07] <csws> smh should've set him to portrait, swapped the left/right click and made the mouse super slow
[08:45:43] <csws> oh and change the browser default search engine to bing

[08:47:08] <Kiernian> ohhh.. that's ANNOYING
[08:47:27] <csws> lol
[08:47:45] <csws> I wonder how that even happened
[08:47:46] <PrincessZoey> went to open one today "wait, didn't I change this on Friday?!"
[08:47:47] <Kiernian> can you still have excel open locally, go file-> open and navigate to it?
[08:48:06] <csws> yeah well they're probably tearing down the hosts and rebuilding nightly
[08:48:08] <csws> we do that on horizon
[08:48:16] <PrincessZoey> yeah. can also right click open with excel 
[08:48:31] <PrincessZoey> makes sense, my screenshots in pictures keep disappearing and it's fucking annoying
[08:48:33] <Kiernian> yeah, so just an annoying extra step...but a long one when you forget to do it
[08:48:35] <csws> then again who knows with roaming profiles
[08:48:38] <csws> assuming they actually do that
[08:48:53] <csws> oh man this is exciting
[08:49:02] <csws> MS finally got to the bottom of why our 2008 r2 hosts aren't updating in azure
[08:49:08] <Kiernian> oh?

[19:45:28] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> no one does

[19:46:24] <arlion> and proxmox
[19:46:45] <arlion> this is easy, just copy the create_vm playbook and fill in a few vars. You're good to go

[19:50:15] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Our org has exactly zero VMs right now and I was anticipating Hyper-V being our hypervisor. But honestly don't have strong feelings since I'm so inexperienced

[19:51:15] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Sure, I mean I use Hyper-V now on my laptop for labbing. But that's not the same as setting up a Production environment and all the little things you need to do things right

[19:52:58] <sd> 14<K​illnine> We're not a big org. We literally have 4 bare metal servers right now and one is a Win10Pro box
[19:54:01] <sd> 14<K​illnine> But there's a lot of dumb crap going on ("here, look at my DC/Fileserver/Printserver/Exchange server...") where we need to break up the responsibilities of our devices.
[19:54:01] <sd> 14<K​illnine> 
[19:54:01] <sd> 14<K​illnine> So I figure at least 2x new rack servers config'd the same and then a SAN from Dell
[19:54:04] <sd> 13<C​olour> I love me some HyperV just don't set the VMs to start straight away ok
[19:54:28] <sd> 13<C​olour> If you ever get some dodgy VM that makes the whole thing get stuck and you can't move the files it's annoying.
[19:54:54] <sd> 13<C​olour> It's like "No HyperV services won't shut down. No you can't move the VM it's starting. No you can't shut it down error occurred."
[19:55:09] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Yuck
[19:55:14] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Our org's whole data set is like < 2TB. 
[19:55:14] <sd> 14<K​illnine> 
[19:55:14] <sd> 14<K​illnine> So I figure if I had about $30K I could get it done.
[19:55:20] <sd> 13<C​olour> But if you move the VM files out before it goes through automatically starting then you get around that.
[19:55:31] <sd> 13<C​olour> Only seen it happen once ever though
[19:55:32] <sd> 14<K​illnine> ^^ that's the stuff I don't know
[19:56:13] <sd> 13<C​olour> Oh and if you have multiple VHDs and you merge checkpoints in the GUI, if it succeeds on one VHD and not the other, it will still say success
[19:56:38] <sd> 13<C​olour> And then you have to manually edit disks and check out the avhdxs and work out their checkpoint chain to merge them all back together manually
[19:57:07] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> Yea, I may or may not have written a powershell that goes out and pulls checkpoints and reports whe it sees open ones
[19:57:12] <sd> 13<C​olour> Yisss
[19:57:16] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> had the same on Vmware for snapshots, mostly cuz people foreget things
[19:57:39] <sd> 14<K​illnine> What's an "open" checkpoint?
[19:57:55] <sd> 13<C​olour> Yeah they always do. Always. Mine were 280GB checkpoint + 1GB avhdx checkpoints + 2GB vhdx from 5 years prior
[19:58:04] <sd> 13<C​olour> On a 500GB RAID5 HDD
[19:58:08] <sd> 13<C​olour> So it couldn't even merge
[19:58:35] <sd> 13<C​olour> Because it would try to copy the 280GB ontop of a 1GB avhdx and then it'd max out space and cancel the merge.
[19:58:39] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> an 'open' checkpoint is one that isn't consolidated
[19:58:51] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> so you have a checkpoint, and it starts to make a differencing disk for all the chagnes from the moment it checkpointed

[22:48:45] <PattyCakes> A payer is required to issue you a Form W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings if you receive certain gambling winnings or have any gambling winnings subject to federal income tax withholding. You must report all gambling winnings as "Other Income" on Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR (use Schedule 1 (Form 1040) PDF), including winnings that aren't reported on a Form W-2G PDF. When you have gambling winnings, you may be required to pay an estimated tax on
[22:48:45] <PattyCakes>  that additional income. For information on withholding on gambling winnings, refer to Publication 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax.
[22:48:56] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the only capital gains involvement would be the difference between when you received it (current price), and when you sold it (sale price)

[22:49:34] <PattyCakes> Yea, crypto makes this tricky. If it were me, I'd file my 22k win as gambling (under other) and then if the value of your winnings has gone up since, that's cap gains
