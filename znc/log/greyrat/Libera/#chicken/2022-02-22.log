[18:40:02] <zilti[m]> So, if you guys wanted to mount a folder into a VM, what would you use? All options I found so far suck. SSHFS and SMB are slow as molasses, NFS needs a crapload of system config, and 9p - besides needing xinetd - fails as soon as you want to do something as simple as make a symlink
[18:41:42] <sjamaan> Back when we were using Vagrant, I think NFS was the only reasonable option
[18:42:26] <sjamaan> I mean, you could maybe use something like Syncthing or Dropbox, but that's not exactly the same (and rather roundabout)
[18:42:49] <zilti[m]> How can it be that there are millions of VMs out there, millions of dev VMs, millions of devices that need to access stuff on each others' disks, yet the only options we have are outdated 90s solutions?
[18:43:48] *** Quits: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:44:39] <Bunny351> zilti: you could ask that about nearly everything in computing
[18:44:48] <zilti[m]> I did use NFS for some time indeed. But it occasionally fails, and then some obscure config needs to be changed, and it all just annoyed me... It's a libvirt/KVM VM running FreeBSD. So unfortunately, no virtio-9p is available (although I suppose it'd have the same issues as manually mounting 9p)
[18:45:32] <zilti[m]> Bunny351: and indeed I am asking myself that more often than I'd care to admit
[18:46:16] <Bunny351> 9p would be the "proper" technical solution
[18:47:28] *** Joins: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74)
[18:48:58] <zilti[m]> Well yea, and that is why I tried 9p. Yet all that's out there in terms of 9p just fails as soon as you throw any kind of real-world requirement at it like using `ln -s` or even just FreeBSD's `unzip` inside a 9p-mounted directory
[18:50:20] <Bunny351> yeah. I use a 9p-fuse adapter sometimes and it also works pretty bad. all existing solutions are half-assed
[18:51:02] <Bunny351> have you tried just copying the files into the VM? :-)
[18:51:33] <sjamaan> 9p2000.u should handle symlinks and such though
[18:51:39] <zilti[m]> Heh, well... Thing is, the files I mount into the VM are files I edit constantly on the host machine, since it's source code
[18:52:32] <sjamaan> I don't know of any documentation for the .u bit though :(
[18:52:51] <sjamaan> zilti[m]: I mess around with "git serve" when I'm doing that

[18:53:04] <sjamaan> [alias] myserve = !git daemon --reuseaddr --verbose --base-path=. --export-all ./.git
[18:53:20] <sjamaan> Then I do "git myserve"
[18:53:37] <sjamaan> You'll need:
[18:53:37] <sjamaan> [daemon] receivepack = true

[18:53:56] <zilti[m]> sjamaan: but where do I get drivers that support 9p2000.u? I tried both 9pfuse (which completely fails to mount 9p folders on FreeBSD) and 9pfs (which funnily enough I found on Bunny351's GitHub, just got forked and updated two days ago by someone)
[18:53:57] <zilti[m]> git myserve... Ok, I'll have a look at that
[18:54:19] <sjamaan> No clue regarding 9p
[18:54:20] <Bunny351> zilzi: updated?
[18:54:25] <sjamaan> It's underdocumented unfortunately
[18:54:40] <Bunny351> 9p2000.u ist just a spec, you still need an impl
[18:54:56] <sjamaan> yeah
