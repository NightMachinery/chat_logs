[06:16:50] <sney> the thing that you think is obvious and should always be installed on every system may not be a universal perspective. um, these things are always discussed to death in debian development though. and the BTS is where.
[06:17:45] <friendofafriend> sney: It's mere kilobytes and countless UNIX-like operating systems have used it for decades.
[06:18:03] <friendofafriend> But now, I have to bring a system up without a network utility, to download and use a network utility.
[06:18:22] <sney> friendofafriend: I don't know why you're still trying to convince me. I'm telling you, if you want to make productive noise, this isn't the place to do it.
[06:18:39] <sney> "ok, thanks sney! I'll go tell a mailing list what I think!" "great, have fun!"
[06:18:47] <friendofafriend> I'm not at all trying to convince you.  I'm trying to understand if there's logic anywhere, sney.
[06:19:30] <sney> and I'm sure there's a mile long email thread full of it for at least net-tools
[06:19:34] <friendofafriend> And if you think that kind of behavior, just removing decades old commands, is cool or funny.  Or acceptable.  I dunno, I just can't understand why Debian keeps doing it.
[06:19:56] <sney> (which was officially deprecated by iproute2, but I just roll with the changes, so I didn't go looking for that particular flamewar)
[06:20:27] <friendofafriend> I guess, it just seems like there's some force that rolls changes through with no resistance at all.
[06:20:41] <sney> that is an inaccurate interpretation by far
[06:20:50] <jmcnaught> bash-completion package is still priority standard.  Does the calamares installer not install standard priority packages?  Or did you deselect "standard system utilities" in the normal installer?
[06:20:53] <friendofafriend> By the time it's ruined, it's a dead issue on the mailing list.

[06:21:45] <sney> jmcnaught: fwiw, calamares doesn't have that as a checkbox. I think it's probably a set-selections thing with the live environment it's duplicating, though that's just speculation
[06:21:52] <friendofafriend> You keep doing it.  I just don't understand why I can't install your distribution and run commands like ifconfig or arp.  And bash completion doesn't work, but it was default in distros decades ago.

[06:24:36] <friendofafriend> So, my "fellow users" just think it's fine to rip features out, save a couple K, and break things?
[06:24:51] <friendofafriend> I'm making sure.  And I want to understand.  That's making it better?

[06:34:02] <sney> with an older machine, something that worked before may have decided that this is enough
[06:34:47] <brachamh> pretty sure both the port and drive are good, and i could probably flash deb-live back to that drive and boot it on the machine in question
[06:35:20] <sney> there's also ventoy, which uses grub and doesn't require as much usb drive reflashing, it's new so I keep forgetting about it

[09:04:52] <quite> greetings. i have this apt preferences for pinning: https://paste.debian.net/1229865/ my problem is that on a couple of systems, i'm still offered to install some pkgs from backports.
[09:05:36] <quite> on one system it's the kernel, and i think the reason might be that i have indeed previous had the kernel from backports (while on buster). is there a way to reset this?

[21:59:42] <johnjaye> not sure how the systemctl syntax works

[22:00:03] <johnjaye> er iwlist.
[22:00:40] <johnjaye> i dual boot windows and ubuntu a well and they could access the wifi
[22:01:01] <Khepra> generally you don't use wpa_supplicant alone or directly. if you don't have something like NetworkManager, you could configure networks(5) to use a specific wpa_supplicant.config
[22:01:03] <johnjaye> should i be looking at the syntax of wpa_supplicant.conf?

[22:03:29] <Khepra> I don't think so
[22:03:41] <johnjaye> it's almost like something went wrong with my network or the hardware after the initial installation. but i can't prove that because all my other phones and my laptop are fine
[22:03:59] <johnjaye> i'm typing this on a laptop right now
[22:04:05] <Khepra> johnjaye: do you have a wpa_supplicant.conf, did the installer create one?
[22:04:19] <johnjaye> no i created it. but the installer must have done something
[22:04:25] <johnjaye> since it was able to get it
[22:04:39] <johnjaye> i tried the simplest entry in the file. the one near the end

[22:05:12] <johnjaye> and that worked so i could apt-get update and install a few things like emacs. but now nothing

[22:06:14] <johnjaye> dpkg says i have ifupdown
[22:06:14] <dpkg> i don't know, johnjaye
[22:08:01] <Khepra> johnjaye: you could add an    iface wlan0 inet dhcp     stanza to /etc/network/interfaces , with only one option:   wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf      :: using actual iface name if it's not wlan0, and actual config file path
[22:08:42] <Khepra> wifi is manged by two OSI layers. wpa_supplicant does the lower, wifi layer, and interfaces(5) deals with dhcp, and thus obtaining the ip, routing
[22:09:05] <Khepra> you need both for wireless networking to work.

[22:30:37] <Khepra> if not... then I suppose your wpa_supplicant isn't configured properly. I don't know if that's prerequisite for iwlist scans, I don't think so

[23:20:20] <Khepra> iface wlan0 inet dhcp \n \t wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant_or_whatever_file_you_use.conf
[23:20:40] <johnjaye> ok
[23:20:46] <johnjaye> i keep having to use wlp6s1 lol
[23:20:51] <johnjaye> when did that convention start?
[23:21:20] <Khepra> I have no idea where it's documented. interfaces(5) options are terribly undocumented. I found that somewhere, once, and am carrying commented out in several backups of interfaces(5) that I carry around, in fear of losing them, forever, to the countless oubliettes of FOSS
[23:22:12] <Khepra> johnjaye: it started when udev was subsumed to systemd methinks. but you can disable it and go back to ethX, wlanX and similar names.     net.ifnames=0    in grub cmdline  (eg /etc/default/grub)  to disable it on boot
[23:23:00] <shibboleth> anyone mind checking their /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.foo.leases?
[23:23:23] <babilen> johnjaye / Khepra: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/
[23:23:31] <Khepra> shibboleth: sorry, no dhcp here :/
[23:23:33] <shibboleth> do your leasefiles get mixed up (ie leases for foo1 ends up in the leasefile for foo2 and vice versa)?
[23:23:48] <shibboleth> also, does ifdown foo1 also bring down foo2?
[23:24:06] <johnjaye> Khepra: i must have not typed it right. because ifup gives a syntax error about the file
[23:24:49] <Khepra> johnjaye: I assume you didn't literally type out \n and \t  but used newline and tab instead?
[23:24:53] <johnjaye> i have auto wlp6s1 then new line then iface wlp6s1 inet dhcp
[23:24:58] <johnjaye> lol
[23:25:02] <johnjaye> that would be funny yeah
[23:25:16] <Khepra> sorry I had to ask. sometimes, some folks..... you never know what kind of support we have to do here :)
[23:25:27] <johnjaye> then i have next line one tab, then wpa-conf, then space then /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

[23:27:09] <Khepra> javabean: that's exatly what should've worked. what kind of error does ifup throw up?
[23:27:47] <johnjaye> said an error with wpa_supplicant.conf
[23:27:54] <johnjaye> is it wpa-conf or wpa_conf ?
[23:27:57] <johnjaye> T_T
[23:27:58] <Khepra> wpa-conf
[23:28:00] <johnjaye> i have wpa-conf
[23:28:04] <johnjaye> ok
[23:28:16] <Khepra> welp... I'm carrying that from the ancient times, and last I used it under buster. don't know if it's possible the directive is no longer supported under bullseye.
[23:29:29] <johnjaye> said that /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/wpasupplicant failed

[23:29:42] <Khepra> johnjaye: it's still in teh wiki, actually:  https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse#WPA-EAP   (ignore the EAP thing, the wpa-cli is listed there)
[23:30:02] <Khepra> johnjaye: maybe it complains if you have an already running wpa_supplicant process
[23:30:28] <johnjaye> i killed it first before running
[23:30:32] <johnjaye> or thought i did
[23:30:51] <Khepra> you _could_ use other wpa-* options for interfaces(5)  but I prefer the separation of concern. wpa_supplicant options in its own file so it can be used standalone

[23:40:56] <karlpinc> I think the best choice is to use /etc/network/interfaces.d/myifname.conf  and put "source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*.conf" into /etc/network/interfaces.  Then you keep each interface in a separate config file.  (Come to think of it, I think the "source ..." line is already in the interfaces file if you've installed "recently enough".)
[23:42:03] <johnjaye> yes it is karlpinc

[23:47:49] <Khepra> johnjaye: so you're saying, using wpa_supplicant with -c directly, works. supplying that same config file (and you've checked there's no typo in the path)  for wpa-conf directive of iface wlan0 inet dhcp stanza, doesn't work?
[23:50:02] <johnjaye> i believe so yes. let me try something real quick
[23:53:08] <johnjaye> yes! IT WORKS

[23:53:40] <johnjaye> Khepra: so what i did was i scrolled up on that wiki page a bit. it has a section for WPA-PSK and WPA-PSK
[23:54:06] <johnjaye> i used the syntax where it starts talking about allow-hotplug and you put wpa-ssid and wpa-psk parameters in the interfaces file
[23:54:20] <johnjaye> tested by restarting and it comes up fine i'm guessing with ifup?
[23:54:41] <shibboleth> karlpinc, nope, ifup foo1 also brings up foo2
[23:54:43] <Khepra> so that would mean wpa-conf has been dropped in bullseye.... or bookworm... you said this was "testing" ISO, yes?
[23:55:05] <shibboleth> although ifdown foo2 then shows that it's supposedly down
[23:55:09] <johnjaye> yes it's bookworm just checked apt sources
[23:55:17] <shibboleth> yeah, i tried sep configs in interfaces.d
[23:55:26] <johnjaye> what is EAP exactly? it seems to be a different thing than WPA2
[23:55:45] <shibboleth> wpa3 enterprise
[23:55:47] <johnjaye> it says something about a client-side certificate
[23:55:47] <shibboleth> wpa2 ent
[23:56:08] <johnjaye> but you're saying wpa-conf parameter worked on everything in buster?
[23:56:45] <Khepra> yes
[23:57:00] <johnjaye> i'm kind of curious what the installer does to bring up the network then. or rather how aggressive it is
[23:57:11] <Khepra> I'm 100% sure because I used it. I had a backup wifi dongle I'd use in case eth blew up
[23:58:24] <johnjaye> because it didn't take long although i don't recall if it downloads anything for apt? i unchecked everything i could on the menu where it asks for Desktop stuff except ssh server
[23:58:25] <johnjaye> actually kind of odd ssh server isn't built in in that case
