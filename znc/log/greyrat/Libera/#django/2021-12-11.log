[01:37:09] <FunkyBob> that's... close
[01:37:50] <FunkyBob> it collects all the migration files in all the INSTALLED_APPS, then checks which migrations are applied [recorded in a table inthe DB], then resolves an order to apply them in... and applies them

[01:39:44] <jmd> FunkyBob: But what actually is a "migration" ?
[01:41:06] <mkat4x> You should think of migrations as a version control system for your database schema. makemigrations is responsible for packaging up your model changes into individual migration files - analogous to commits - and migrate is responsible for applying those to your database.
[01:41:42] <jmd> mkat4x: Yeah I think I read those exact words on the website.
[01:42:08] <mkat4x> in lay terms, it 'migrates' your description of how your database should look into actual database structure
[01:43:01] <mkat4x> A - this is how I want my database to be. B. Hi, I am your database. User: please migrate A to B

[01:54:38] <FunkyBob> jmd: are you asking what the term means? or what goes into the files we call migrations?
[01:58:42] <jmd> I really want to understand the concept.  It seems to be something necessary, since without doing it I get lots of warnings.
[01:59:44] <FunkyBob> ok... so what part of the documentaiton that two people have now linked y ou to... is not resolving this?
[02:00:18] <FunkyBob> we record a set of steps describing what to do to y our DBMS to make the tables, fields, and data your application needs to run
[02:00:29] <FunkyBob> applying the migration affects those steps
[02:02:34] <FunkyBob> those steps are things like "create a table with these fields"  or "add this field to that table" , or "change this field to be"
[02:02:49] <FunkyBob> they can also be "data migrations" which alter t he data
[02:03:18] <FunkyBob> yes, it's necessary, because without  them... your models become permanent.
[02:03:30] <FunkyBob> imagine never being able to change your models and their fields?
[02:04:16] <mkat4x> Making Database Changes Without SQL
[02:04:17] <mkat4x> Without migrations, you would have to connect to your database and type in a bunch of SQL commands or use a graphical tool like PHPMyAdmin to modify the database schema every time you wanted to change your model definition.
[02:04:17] <mkat4x> In Django, migrations are primarily written in Python, so you don’t have to know any SQL unless you have really advanced use cases.

[02:05:39] <FunkyBob> also so they're cross-DBMS
[02:06:39] <mkat4x> here it is in different words: Migrations are one of the most used features of Django. It allows us to build complex applications without even writing a single database query. Migrations are basically responsible for generating database schema for your models. Means that anything that you do in your models is just a few commands away from getting
[02:06:40] <mkat4x> reflected in your database!

[02:15:13] <jmd> So as far as I can make out ./manage.py migrate is a way of creating the database (in my case db.sqlite3)
[02:15:42] <FunkyBob> jmd: if you're using sqlite, that's a side effect of creating th tables, yes
[02:16:03] <FunkyBob> if you were, for instance, using Postgres... you would make the DB yourself, and migrate would create the tables, indices, etc...
[02:16:14] *** Quits: theprophet (~theprophe@85.114.228.184) (Quit: Client closed)
[02:16:21] <FunkyBob> migrate, as we've mentioned, _also_ manages changes over time
[02:16:53] <FunkyBob> when you run "makemigrations", Django works out what's changed in your models... and writes the migration files.
[02:17:10] <FunkyBob> when you run "migrate", django works out which of those migration files have not been applied, and tries to apply them
[02:17:27] <jmd> What's changed since when?
[02:17:44] <FunkyBob> since your last migration
[02:18:06] <FunkyBob> you understand that over t ime, you may add more models, change their fields, etc?
[02:19:39] <mkat4x> like if you created you database tables etc. then later as you code and you add new fields of tables migrations can compare your new additions to existing database structure and will create the new changes into your database
[02:19:54] <jmd> okay so a "migration" is a set of changes to the database.  But what is the advantage  in creating a differential set.  Why not just create an empty databse, and apply all changes, and be done with it?
[02:19:54] <mkat4x> kind of like git
[02:20:11] <FunkyBob> jmd:
[02:20:15] <FunkyBob> 21:56 < FunkyBob> you understand that over t ime, you may add more models, change their fields, etc?
[02:21:00] <jmd> Sure I'll do that.  And when I do, I'll just recreate my databse and start using it.
[02:21:13] <FunkyBob> no
[02:21:18] <FunkyBob> so when you're in production
[02:21:23] <FunkyBob> you'd just throw away your entire sites data?
[02:21:41] <FunkyBob> no, you wouldn't
[02:21:41] <mkat4x> lets say you have a database table for customers. you created the database structure. then later your boss wants some cusomers to have VIP status, so now you have to edit the datase to accomodate for the new request
[02:22:41] <jmd> Oh  I see your point.  But my application is rather different.
[02:22:46] <FunkyBob> why?
[02:23:04] <mkat4x> instead of rewriting your databse from scratch you just add things here and there as your app evolves
[02:23:20] <FunkyBob> mkat4x: ease up... this works best with just one person helping at a time :)
[02:23:45] <mkat4x> sorry
[02:23:59] <FunkyBob> it's all good
[02:24:12] <FunkyBob> jmd: why is your application different?
[02:24:59] <jmd> Because I'm not actually going to be making modifications whilst there is live data.
[02:26:34] <FunkyBob> well, you still need the initial migration to create the tables
[02:26:52] <jmd> Yes.  That's the only one I will need.
[02:27:50] <jmd> I think what you're saying is that migrations enable one to upgrade large websites on the fly without loosing state.
[02:28:06] <FunkyBob> large , small... any
[02:28:14] <jmd> right.

[21:48:33] <BinarySavior> hi, i'm trying to model a many to many relationship.  working on a dog walking app.  one or more dogs can do on one or more walks.  Does this look like a valid model for that relationship? https://bpa.st/YXCQ
[21:49:11] <BinarySavior> ignore the models.CASCADE they should all be models.PROTECT
[21:49:41] <pembo13> BinarySavior, I dislike seeing fk_ prefixes, but yes.. looks good
[21:50:27] <pembo13> Pee and Poo could really just reference Walks
[21:50:43] <pembo13> i also don't like plural model names... but that's a personal style
[21:52:24] <BinarySavior> thanks for confirming, I will consider those suggestions as well. I guess fk_ prefix is not necessary with this level of abstraction in ORM?
[21:53:01] <pembo13> BinarySavior, fk_ prefix is useful for raw table stuff, less so for ORMs
