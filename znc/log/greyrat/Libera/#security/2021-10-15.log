[08:38:53] <HaMsTeRs> Thanks MadCamel:  But this doesn't seem to work in my company.  They hired some degree holders (like 20+) and promoted to manager and managing us after the acquisition.  I'm not sure if this is some kind of strategy they used to ask us to leave, or using us to train those 20+ as management.  Doesn't mean the age is the issue, but talking about how stuff works.

[12:02:38] <shan> Hi all. What's the best way to safely store an application token? I'm trying to make a desktop app that connects to a web-based backend, and I want the user to be able to copy-paste a short token from the website into the app to connect the app. I am not sure how to store the token on the user's machine so they don't have to enter it again and again. Additionally, I'd welcome input on how best to
[12:02:40] <shan> generate the token to prevent any collisions.
[12:02:53] <shan> I'm using rust for both the backend and the frontend(the frontend uses Tauri.)
[12:03:21] *** Joins: fcinq (~irc@network.g33k.host)
[12:03:24] <me-sudoer-dentne> hash and encrypt with a public key?
[12:03:50] <me-sudoer-dentne> or just encrypt with a bigger public key like rsa4096
[12:04:23] <JPT> Does hashing/encrypting it stop someone who stole it from using it to authenticate though?
[12:04:49] <me-sudoer-dentne> JPT: well thats one way
[12:05:00] <Apachez> encryption at rest and encryption in the move
[12:05:15] <shan> i'm not even sure if I should be worried about what happens if the user's machine is compromised
[12:05:24] <Apachez> hashing stuff only (somewhat) helps against somebody finding out the actual content
[12:05:33] <shan> if the user's machine is compromised then the attacker can use the machine the usual way, right
[12:05:34] <Apachez> a token should (normally) be just a random string
[12:06:04] <Apachez> yeah go for yubikey or similar if you want some hardware assisted auth
[12:06:16] *** leon_ is now known as leon

[12:07:10] <shan> @token, how long do i make it so it's "basically impossible" for two people to get the same token?
[12:07:33] <JPT> If you generate something like a uuidv4 you should be on the safe side already
[12:07:35] *** Joins: leon (~znc@user/leon)
[12:07:40] *** Joins: ShiftyLogic (~shiftylog@66.115.147.138)
[12:08:29] <shan> and as for invalidation, that's just storing the time the session was created and then whenever my app starts up i delete the ones that are older than $now - $interval, right?
[12:08:35] <JPT> To enforce unique tokens, if you store them in a database, use a unique constraint
[12:08:45] <shan> oh that'd work :0
[12:09:39] <JPT> Well, token lifetime depends on your requirements and what you feel is a reasonable way of dealing with things.
[12:10:14] <JPT> You could make them run indefinitely, auto-expire them after a certain amount of inactivity or have the user manually clean them up if they wish
[12:10:32] <shan> auto-expiration seems nice
[12:10:51] <JPT> "Damn, I was on vacation, and now I have to log in again everywhere!"
[12:11:55] <JPT> If it makes sense, you could try and introduce MFA in some way. I heard these OTP-Apps are really nice and universal.
[12:12:53] <JPT> But first, think about what kind of data/access you need to protect and what kind of scenarios you care about.

[12:13:21] <JPT> You will end up with different results depending on how sensitive the stuff you need to protect really is.
[12:13:21] <Apachez> or just put that in token creating
[12:13:32] <Apachez> base64 some random chars (lets say 64 or whatever)
[12:13:38] <Apachez> if already exists, generate a new
[12:13:39] <Apachez> done
[12:13:57] <shan> hmmm
[12:14:06] <Apachez> and like add some trigger so after 10 loops and still "sorry already exists" then throw an error and contact admin :P
[12:14:09] <me-sudoer-dentne> shan JPT keep it simple...... keep the copy of the token on the server and use it per session
[12:14:16] *** Quits: ShiftyLogic (~shiftylog@66.115.147.138) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:14:42] <Apachez> on server side you can append stuff like ip ranges and stuff however people tend to move using cellphones so just limiting to /24 or so might still be a bad idea
[12:14:49] <JPT> Sure, you can just implement something that works. But perhaps it makes sense to sit for a few minutes and think about whether the solution fits your needs. :)
[12:14:52] <Apachez> and you must decide what to do if token is reused elsewhere
[12:15:13] <Apachez> there are plenty of already existing libs on this topic
[12:15:23] <me-sudoer-dentne> btw what kind of software are you building??? web or system?
[12:15:29] <shan> me-sudoer-dentne: but the client needs a copy of the token if it wants to prove its identity to the server still, right?

[12:17:16] <shan> wait, gimme a second while i describe the system better
[12:17:57] <JPT> A token is more or less like your physical key to your front door. Anyone who posesses it can open that door lock. Perhaps you swap it for a new one after using it once to prevent guessing or abusing copies found in old backups.

[12:19:39] <me-sudoer-dentne> change the key/token nevertheless very often

[23:54:51] <piou> Today banks are mostly used for two things that don't generally come to mind first when thinking about banks: loans and money creation. Loans are easy to grasp, but hard to replace.

[23:57:29] <piou> currencies, the dollar and euro notably, are based on loans. They're not indexed on gold or anything but are a reflection of the money you owe banks. It has tremendous advantages (in particular when it comes to controlling inflation etc) and it wasn't exactly a choice (in fact most economists thought things worked differently and had to be shown that in practice most of the money we use is
[23:57:35] <piou> created through regular common loans). But it's a fact, and money is used to ease the process of money exchange resulting in more productivity (which we might criticize, but that's the goal of most governments and economies atm).
