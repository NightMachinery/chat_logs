[00:19:45] <LjL> Bayes, i would use a comma, especially if spelling out "for example" instead of going "e.g."
[00:19:50] <LjL> but i think it's really not a big deal either way
[00:20:13] <Bayes> LjL that'd be like 3 commas :/
[00:20:37] <LjL> well i wouldn't put that comma after "e.g." personally
[00:20:50] <Bayes> I feel like commas tend to clutter a sentence so I use them sparingly
[00:21:07] <LjL> i just feel that since "at noon" is not part of the example (it's not that it's common to eat a sandwitch at noon *or* an energy bar at night, instead your main claim is that it's common to eat something at noon, and then you make an example), it makes more sense for it to be separated
[00:21:40] <Bayes> ohh LjL well that's a great catch really
[00:22:12] <Bayes> it has to be clear in that example that example is not /eating a sandwich at noon/
[00:22:20] <LjL> try tweaking it a little and see what happens: "It's common to eat something, like a sandwich at noon". the sentence is mostly unchanged, but now to me it sounds really off without that comma
[00:23:05] <Bayes> in this case, /the sandwich/ is an example and at noon goes with "it's common to eat a snack"

[04:28:00] <FishBone000> What's the meaning of the 2nd sentence of "I’m in dire need of a battery. Working here as long as I have."
[04:28:49] <LjL> i find that non-obvious
[04:29:34] <LjL> it could mean "given i've worked here so long", but it would usually come before the main statement, and not as a separate sentence
[04:29:56] <LjL> or, but this is far-fetched, "the old battery has been working here as long as i have (implying for a long time and it's due for replacement)"
[04:30:02] <LjL> any more context?
[04:30:32] <FishBone000> ok, the full conversation is: "I’m in dire need of a battery. Working here as long as I have. I know there’s bound to be one unused somewhere in those wastes. But I absolutely refuse to leave my bunker. You’ve seen those wretched. buzzing things outside. haven’t you? They're awful creatures. The last time I mustered enough courage to go out there. they damaged my battery cell. I desperately require a replacement. Find one for m
[04:30:32] <FishBone000> e. yes? I’d be tremendously in your debt. And if you manage to exterminate a few of those flying vermin along the way. all the better. I sure won’t miss them."
[04:31:03] <FishBone000> A npc's talk before a mission
[04:31:08] <MetaNova> FishBone000: it's a misplaced fullstop
[04:31:12] <LjL> in that case i'd guess it's "Working here as long as I have, I know there's bound to be..."
[04:31:27] <LjL> so the meaning is the first that i gave, but it relates to the following sentence, ont the preceding one
[04:31:27] <MetaNova> it should read, "Working here as long as I have, I know there's bound to be one unused somewhere in those wastes."
[04:32:16] <MetaNova> ("Due to working here as long as I have, I know there's bound to be one unused somewhere in those wastes."
[04:32:18] <MetaNova> )
[04:33:10] * FishBone000 is still confused
[04:33:48] <FishBone000> then what's the meaning of " Working here as long as I have" in Working here as long as I have, I know there’s ..."?
[04:33:57] <MetaNova> I tried to explain that
[04:33:57] <LjL> Because I've worked here very long, and I know how things are around this place, I know there has to be an unused battery somewhere in those wastes.
[04:34:30] <MetaNova> FishBone000: it is an implied "one of the consequences of working here as long as I have is knowing that there's bound to be one unused somewhere in those wastes"
[04:34:58] <FishBone000> Ah I see
[04:35:57] <FishBone000> I just couldn't understand "I have" in "Working here as long as I have"
[04:36:20] <LjL> "Working here as long as I have [worked here]"
[04:36:47] <LjL> English has this thing where you can sometimes have implied main verbs after helper verbs, and the implied main verb is a verb that was used before, *not necessarily* in the same tense

[04:36:59] <LjL> so even though the form used the first time was "working", the "I have" implies a "worked"
[04:39:16] <FishBone000> Thanks :)
[04:39:40] <LjL> in some other languages, or for that matter sometimes even in English, that would be rendered as something like "Working here as long as I have done", with a do-like verb substituting for the main verb
