[00:27:42] <form_feed> I'm trying to understand how use-hard-newlines work. My thought was that it would make commands like backward-paragraph recognize lines with just one newline at the end as paragraphs (instead of the default, where we need to insert another newline to have a visual paragraph separator). It doesn't work, not in enriched-mode or text mode. Here, it doesn't seem to change a thing. I'm using Emacs

[01:04:58] <yeti> I never looked at borg's storage format...  is it readable with standard unix tools?
[01:05:04] <grym> there's little to dislike about rsync
[01:05:05] <Bayes> since rsync is fairly efficient, and I'm not sure I'll ever use borg incremental diff though maybe one day
[01:05:13] <grym> the trailing-slash thing i guess
[01:05:22] <Bayes> bpalmer oh thanks, I actually doubted for a second but took my chance...
[01:05:41] <Catie> rsync is really easy to rig up in a script and then just leave alone for forever. The massive number of options is a bit irritating though, I always have to go through the manpage when I want to use it

[04:30:00] <edrx> but let my ask the first question here. ATM when I want to find the source code of a function - say, of a function called dispfun1 - I grep for it in the source, and then I create an elisp hyperlink to it, like this one,
[04:30:01] <edrx> (find-maximagitfile "src/mlisp.lisp" "(defmspec $dispfun ")
[04:30:11] <edrx> and I put it in my notes.
[04:30:42] <edrx> what would you do to find the source code of dispfun / $dispfun / dispfun1?
[04:30:56] <Catie> In bare SBCL, or in SLIME/SLY?
[04:31:06] <edrx> bare SBCL preferably
[04:31:42] <Catie> To my knowledge you can only do that in the debugger
[04:31:47] <edrx> if you can teach me how to that in slimy/sly that would be really great too

[05:14:57] <s-liao1> Yes. I tried eev and eepitch. it is cool.

[05:32:43] <Catie> So there's other files you've gotta load before you load init-cl.lisp. Is there a .asd file somewhere in the maxima directory? I'm afraid I've never used the tool
[05:32:52] <Unicorn_Princess> is describe-current-coding-system what i want to be using to find out the encoding (utf-8, utf-16, iso8859-1 etc.. not just unix/windows line endings) of a file? because the 1st 2 lines of its output for a few test files were "Coding system for saving this buffer:  - -- undecided-unix (alias: unix)", which seems to only talk about line endings, and not actual encoding

[10:19:58] <twb> If you can cross-compile from windows, "make sv.gnu.org do it" probably gets easier
[10:20:13] <corwin> as to jit, no but it will take a bit of hacking on Phillip's scripts so I wanted to make sure things basically worked for me before I started further hackery

[10:21:21] <corwin> depending on feedback (and if my notes help the others who were stuck and what tthey want to work on), I'll either next try to make a jit version or else try to get signing going.
[10:22:17] <corwin> the work is basically that nativecomp works great for me locally but the current tooling for creating windows binaries doesn't expect to produce more that one set of distributables per branch

[11:24:57] <wgreenhouse> dirtcastle: not familiar specifically with elfeed, but is it just using `browse-url-browser-function`?

[18:16:25] <jkaye> i3 is good
[18:16:31] <rpav> like letting you presplit heads into frames and keep them there .. clfswm also did that i think but it had other issues, like not supporting multiple heads ;)
[18:17:07] <cosimone> akater[m]: alright, how would i go about that?
[18:18:32] *** Quits: wre^ (~wre@wsip-98-188-246-242.mc.at.cox.net) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:19:06] <rpav> catern: ok actually i guess this may be slightly not-as-good as that .. e.g. if i jump directly from head 1 to head 0, then directionally-move back, it will jump to the prior frame _on that head_ when it's in that direction, e.g., i have D focused, and i focus directly to A, if i focus-right multiple times, it will go A->B->D
[18:19:10] <akater[m]> cosimone: See eval-and-compile, or cl-eval-when if you prefer CL flavour.
[18:20:12] <rpav> this is usually not an issue because 1) it's hard to skip focusing windows and 2) this is probably what you want in most cases, e.g. when scrolling through opposing-direction splits .. but if you wanted to correct it, probably you could with a slightly more sophisticated command
[18:20:27] *** Joins: visl (visl@user/visl)
[18:20:35] <catern> rpav: interesting deficiency, it's weird that that 1 is on the right side of 0, but it doesn't know enough to jump to the leftmost window in 1
[18:20:50] <catern> it's weird that it knows that*

[18:21:50] <rpav> catern: sortof it's not .. imagine you have [A|[B0/B1]] [C|..] where B0 and B1 are horizontally split; if you scroll through that, it's unclear which is "right of" A, so it remembers which was more-recently focused
[18:23:36] <rpav> i only rarely encounter it .. it might be possible to really go to the leftmost window, but that sortof gets complicated when you have nontrivial splits
[18:24:41] <catern> ok
[18:24:48] <rpav> like what if you have [A|B] [▚|D]
[18:24:49] <catern> so hlwm does not have this feature :)
[18:25:01] <rpav> catern: in practice, it will almost always work that way :p
[18:25:15] <catern> rpav: work what way, sorry?
[18:25:26] <rpav> in the desired way we discussed above
[18:25:41] <cosimone> akater[m]: i'll check those out, thanks
[18:25:44] <catern> didn't you just say moving through [A|B] [C|D] is wrong?
[18:25:45] <rpav> in the general case, nothing _can_ work that way, because there is not always a distinct left-of or right-of
[18:26:03] <catern> shrug
[18:26:12] <rpav> catern: only if you move nonlinearly from D to A, which is difficult/unusual

[18:26:51] <catern> um, don't you use head selection hotkeys?

[18:27:25] <catern> shrug
[18:27:25] <rpav> but like even if it does happen, it's sortof so-what .. i dont' encounter it happening enough to have even bothered looking into making it slightly more accurate
[18:27:42] <rpav> and again, it's impossible to _actually_ implement for the general case
[18:28:17] <catern> whatever you say
[18:28:55] <catern> it doesn't sound like hlwm is doing anything close to the feature I was talking about, but i don't care enough to argue about it
[18:28:56] <rpav> if you think otherwise, how would moving right from B work in the case of: [A|B] [▚|D] .. where ▚ is a 4-way split 
[18:29:15] <catern> it would move to a randomly selected window of the two leftmost
[18:29:25] <catern> (well, arbitrarily, not randomly)
[18:29:25] <rpav> if you don't think it even sounds _close_, then indeed, i'm not going to waste further time trying to discuss a practical solution

[20:14:23] <bpalmer> ville: as for what I'm implying: it's a docstring, so that's one big string. At that point, elisp syntax wise, \= has no magic meaning.

[20:14:51] <johnjaye> but it would make a fun movie. since apparently they need ideas for movies now
[20:15:02] <bpalmer> ville: \= is presumably used by some tool to escape the quote (which in elisp is syntactically relevant). I thought it was an org mode syntax, but maybe not.

[20:26:16] <johnjaye> i'm wonder what that could be
[20:26:24] <bpalmer> As far as elisp is concerned, that's a string.
[20:27:24] <bpalmer> the contents of the string are not really its business; some things in emacs will pay attention to docstrings (for example, whether it starts with *) but that's technically part of emacs tooling, not elisp.

[21:32:33] <contrapunctus> I'm writing some tests using ERT. They create files, then edit them in Emacs, and I try to delete them once done...but using `kill-buffer` keeps prompting me about something or the other. First I'd get "buffer modified, save?" (dealt with it by using `(set-buffer-modified-p nil)` ), now I'm getting "Delete excess backup versions of <file>?" (even though I added a `(let ((delete-excess-backups t)) ... 
[21:32:33] <contrapunctus> (kill-buffer))` ) :|
[21:33:02] <twrk> it seems dtrt may mean "do the right thing". wtf does "tmdm" mean?, also zebrag, wdym "steal your windows"
[21:33:20] <zebrag> grym: yey, that one. Do you use it personally? I've heard it might break things. For now I'm limiting myself to only one window because I've heard it's the only way to use emacs, but it's hard to deal with large files with only one single window. Thanks for the advice anyway

[23:05:36] <Common-Lisp> wow there's like...no way to download a protobuf binary release other than as a zip file, huh
[23:05:39] <Common-Lisp> that is very very annoying
[23:06:01] <technomancy> oh god; does mosh use protobufs?
[23:06:05] <technomancy> protobufs are so bad
[23:06:07] <Common-Lisp> technomancy: yes. 
[23:06:10] <technomancy> =(
[23:06:14] <Common-Lisp> that's my biggest roadblock for using mosh right now.
[23:06:21] <technomancy> I mean they're miserable to develop against. they're quite efficient.
[23:06:27] <grym> googley all over 
[23:07:06] <Common-Lisp> it seems like there's no way to download a binary for the protobuf compiler, except as a zip.
[23:07:15] <Common-Lisp> so I might have to compile protobuf on the server here, which would be quite annoying
[23:07:32] <Common-Lisp> although probably less annoying than downloading the binary to another system and unarchiving it, then scping it...

[23:58:02] <Bayes> Catie well they got fairly mean at some point but after a while it clicked that the things I'm escaping when I'm entering a cli command need not be escaped when the script creates the bash call
[23:58:21] <bpalmer> xaltsc: require checks the feature list and then guesses at the filename if the feature hasn't been provided.
[23:58:25] <Bayes> but overall it works, it seems
[23:59:06] <Bayes> except that rsyncing to a mounted google drive folder is not the best option but doesn't need vpn and 2fa like connecting to remote servers would
[23:59:06] <bpalmer> xaltsc: you can write your own require thing that turns a feature name into a filename to load
