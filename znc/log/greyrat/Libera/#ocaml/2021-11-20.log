[00:01:18] <d_bot> <Yugami> your cat is outdated !
[00:18:11] <d_bot> <Swerve> I have a small piece of code which which spawns the error `Warning 11: this match case is unused', how can I fix this? https://pastebin.com/YSGkS4Q2
[00:19:30] <d_bot> <NULL> Your first match is a variable name so it matches any input and just binds it to this name. Consequently, any further case becomes useless

[00:25:11] <d_bot> <Swerve> I see. Is there a way to alias the int on line 2 so that I can do proper pattern matching?
[00:26:34] <d_bot> <NULL> You can't (unless there's a feature I don't know about)
[00:27:14] <d_bot> <Swerve> Bummer. Thanks for the help anyway
[00:28:33] <d_bot> <NULL> You can add it as a guard in the pattern matching, but at this point it's easier to do an if
[00:29:26] <d_bot> <Swerve> Right

[00:32:52] <d_bot> <Et7f3> ðŸ¤¦
[00:33:13] <d_bot> <Et7f3> @Swerve what about regular variant ?
[00:35:27] <d_bot> <Swerve> I need to be able to insert these into byte strings, and it's not obvious how to do that with variants.
[00:35:45] <sim642> You could use a regular  variant type with [@@deriving enum] and [@value ...] for the corresponding integers
[00:36:59] <sim642> Of course if they're sequential and you're careful not to reorder them, you even don't need all the [@value ...] annotations
[00:39:42] <d_bot> <Swerve> Fantastic! This might be just what I'm looking for

[05:02:22] <d_bot> <cemerick> I ask because containers, etc., seems quite nicely formatted, and in relatively sane ways. Every few months, I try to use ocamlformat again, and am quickly hit with cases where it does IMO really unpleasant stuff.

[05:34:46] <d_bot> <darrenldl> oh huh, i ended up going from ocp-indent to ocamlformat
[05:35:01] <d_bot> <darrenldl> curious where it fails for you @cemerick
[05:40:18] <companion_cube> @cemerick, yes
[05:40:35] <companion_cube> I still format by hand mostly (just leaving indentation to ocp-indent)
[05:45:38] <d_bot> <cemerick> ok, that's explains it
[05:45:52] <d_bot> <cemerick> I also mostly hand-format still, but would like to not
[05:48:12] <companion_cube> I think the same, but ocamlformat always makes me unhappy
[05:48:19] <companion_cube> I think the grammar doesn't lend itself well to that :(
[05:49:00] <d_bot> <cemerick> @darrenldl eh, it's a different thing each time; the current frustration is that it does bad things to "pipeline" expressions (series of operations chained with `|>`). Depending on the subexpressions' length, it either leaves them all on one line (which is fine for 2, *maybe* three very short exprs), or it wraps them into irregular separate lines: two exprs on one line, then a few single-line exprs, then another pair on one line

[07:20:37] <d_bot> <darrenldl> ...right i vaguely recall trying to follow the footsteps of rust fmt and go fmt tools...
[07:20:50] <d_bot> <darrenldl> recall mentioning of trying*
[07:21:05] <d_bot> <darrenldl> i uh...i don't know about that tbh
[07:21:31] <d_bot> <darrenldl> at this rate i might have to write my own formatter for security code : D (half jk
[07:22:51] <companion_cube> tbh you'd be better off writing a new syntax that has one obvious formatting
[07:23:01] <companion_cube> (Reason had it right on that point)
[07:23:24] <companion_cube> new syntax also means you can have a convention from the start
[07:23:27] <companion_cube> :p
[07:23:34] <d_bot> <darrenldl> is reason still uh...dependable?
[07:24:58] <companion_cube> not sure tbh
[07:25:03] <companion_cube> but they had that idea right at least
[07:25:19] <companion_cube> go and rust are also C-like (ish) and imho it formats more easily
[07:25:28] <d_bot> <darrenldl> yep

[22:43:35] <sim642> The readme says Cygwin
[22:43:51] <sim642> If you mean setup-ocaml
[22:47:05] <d_bot> <mbacarella> oh. indeed. ok
[22:47:59] <d_bot> <mbacarella> my build is failing on that one because termios.h can't be included, and the solution is to install "cygwin-devel" apparently? though i'd expect that to be installed by default.
[22:48:08] <d_bot> <mbacarella> trying it anyway
