[01:38:36] <piou> Otherwise, assuming that you did open all the services you want to use... sounds reasonnable. If you have IPv6 configured on your computer note that you need to setup a separate iptable, with ip6tables I think

[01:58:39] <piou> It's not very useful to have strict iptables rules directly on the system because if the port isn't open then it doesn't matter whether the INPUT rule for this port is ACCEPT or DROP
[01:59:03] <piou> So most people just close ports rather than setting up elaborate iptables directly on the system
[01:59:39] <piou> On the other end, on a system used as a firewall, then configuring iptables is interesting because you need elaborate rules to coordinate traffic for the other computers

[02:07:37] <piou> ok, so you have 3 ports listening to the outside world, 22 is ssh, 53 is a DNS, no idea what 56700 is
[02:07:57] <piou> at the moment, with the rules you have choosen, the DNS and 56700 parts won't work
[02:08:03] <piou> which might be what you want

[02:10:31] <piou> no
[02:11:09] <piou> ok, at the moment you have a dns server running on the system. That server is made to be used by other external computers since it has a port open. Is that what you want?
[02:11:12] <Guma__> Do you mean ISP DNS send send dns updated to my machine?
[02:11:33] <piou> no, it's not about the dns used by your machine, it's about the dns service your machine provides to others
[02:11:47] <piou> your machine is running a dns server at the moment
[02:11:53] <piou> on the port 53
[02:12:09] <piou> do you want it to provide a dns service to other machines?
[02:12:17] <Guma__> well I can ping and resolve with now with only 22 open. So why do I need 53 again?
[02:12:35] <piou> I don't know, it's your machine, but it has a dns service running
[02:12:41] <Guma__> There will be no other machines conneced to this device. it is IoT device
[02:12:48] <piou> clearly you don't know about it and don't use it so you don't need to have it open
[02:13:07] <piou> the best way is to stop the dns service on the machine
[02:13:14] *** Joins: PiRATA (~weechat@user/pirata)
[02:13:25] <piou> stopping the service, freeing its resources, closing the port
[02:13:50] <piou> No more open port, no more connections on that service, and without configuring a single iptables rule
[02:13:54] <Guma__> but I think I understand what you saying . If there would be other devices connected through my IoT device then they would get resolved trought DNS server on my IoT? Correct? And they I would need that port open
[02:14:18] <piou> If you want them to be able to use your machine as a DNS server, then you need that port open
[02:14:26] <piou> If you don't then you don't need that port open
[02:14:38] <Guma__> I will disable it on boot. But just wanted to understand for future :)
[02:15:07] <piou> same thing with the service that opened 56700
[02:16:54] <piou> What I'm saying with regards to you not really needing iptables is that the best way to avoid connections to unwanted services on your machine is to not run unwanted services in the first place. But on the other hand you seem to not know that system well enough to do that efficiently, so maybe setting up iptables is the best way for you after all.
[02:17:43] <piou> Most people don't go through the trouble of starting a server only to disallow its use through iptables, they just don't start it in the first place
[02:18:07] <piou> And if nothing is waiting for an incomming connection, then it doesn't matter whether these ports are ACCEPT or DROP in iptables
[02:19:16] <Guma__> Last question on DNS server. II I decide on different project to use dns server for other local devices, Why would that port needs to be open? If a slave device makes a query it will hit dns server on my IoT and they will resolve it or it will quer from ISP. So this would be outbound request. I am lost on that part

[02:20:29] <piou> a service that opens a port is its way of saying "I am accepting incoming requests, please communicate with me at this number". You can't communicate with a closed port. So if you want to provide a service (DNS or otherwise) to external computers, you need that port to be open.
[02:20:43] <piou> That's the reason why you open the SSH port
[02:21:30] *** Joins: m6wiq (~m6wiq@51.148.147.13)
[02:21:37] <Guma__> But ssh request will be initiated from outside and that is why 22 must be open. But dns server is on the inside and why open port for it.
[02:21:48] <piou> no

[02:25:16] <piou> Let's call "the server" the raspberry pi on which runs a DNS server. Let's call "the client" another computer, say on the same network for easy communication. If the server wants to resolve a name it must ask a DNS server. That can be a local server, running locally. This server needs only a local port, no inbound connection. The server can also ask an external DNS server, be it your ISP's or
[02:25:22] <piou> google's or other. Then the request is sent to these servers.  The exact same is true for the client, it can run a local dns server, or direct its requests to external servers such as your ISP's. But this external server can also be The Server, your raspberry pi. To do that a DNS server must run on The Server and that DNS server must be open to external requests, so it needs an open port to the
[02:25:28] <piou> outside.
[02:25:31] <piou> It is the exact same as for SSH
[02:26:15] <piou> If you only ever SSH to the machine from which you SSH you don't need to expose a port to the outside, but if you want other computers to connect to your server you need to open the port.
[02:26:54] <piou> At the moment your machine has the port 53 (DNS) open, so it is providing an external DNS server for other computers to use.
[02:27:17] <piou> This is completely independant from whatever DNS service it uses for its own requests.

[02:30:49] <Guma__> I just looked up DNS and port 53. It is UDP stateless. That is why it has to be open
[02:31:02] <piou> that has nothing to do with anything
[02:31:24] <piou> It has to be open if and only if you want to provide a DNS service to other computers

[02:31:49] <Guma__> Ok Got it. Thank you for your explanation and your "time" :)
[02:31:50] <piou> so you want to provide that DNS service to other computers after all?
[02:32:06] <Guma__> No I do not. It is a stand alone machine
[02:32:24] <piou> then don't add a rule to allow it, and shut that dns server down

[02:32:44] <piou> you don't need a rule for that, you just need to not run the dns so that there's nothing to communicate with
[02:32:55] <Guma__> sending collected data (manufacturing) to servers
[02:32:56] <piou> don't run a service if you're not going to use it
[02:33:20] <piou> collected data has nothing to do with anything related to your dns server
[02:34:18] <piou> Look, that's simple, if you don't want to manage a dog, you don't take a dog. If you don't want to provide a DNS service, you don't run the DNS service. You don't set it up then put a sign saying "don't use the DNS service that I have running here"

[02:40:23] *** Joins: Telvana (~capo@user/telvana)
[02:40:40] <piou> There is a small chance that your system is configured to use that local DNS over an external one as jessicara described. If so then it won't work as intented but it should still work. And there is a very very big chance that the system doesn't use this DNS server at all and you'll just be running it for nothing.

[02:41:20] <piou> "should still work" -> I do expect the use of a backup dns server

[02:41:38] <piou> Just try it really, shut the service down and try

[02:42:09] <piou> Don't forget to also look for the service that opens 56700

[03:18:06] <piou> the main issue with communication platforms isn't technical though, it's that nobody wants to fill their devices with communication apps then remember who uses what app. A communication app is only as good as the number of people you can use it with.

[03:23:58] <ajak> so metadata is abnormally useful to you whereas it's not to most people
[03:24:05] <piou> The main argument for metadata protection is that if you know, say, that I received a call from my doctor then made a call to my mom and to an abortion clinic, you don't need to hear the call to have a good impression of what is said. But none of that is necessary if you know what is said :)

[03:33:25] <piou> it's nice as well
[03:33:38] <LILO[m]> Bullet proof*
[03:33:41] <piou> of course
[03:33:42] <LILO[m]> You can break ribs..
[03:33:49] <LILO[m]> Or bruise organs...
[03:34:02] <LILO[m]> piou: I hate suits for some reason...
[03:34:29] <piou> *sigh*
[03:34:30] <LILO[m]> Just picture a hippie typing you 😆
[03:35:20] *** Joins: Sunrise (~lhull@user/chalcedony)
[03:35:32] <piou> still, a nice, well made, bespoke suit, 3 piece of fine wool, all the pockets you want made specifically for your EDC... it's nice
[03:36:16] *** Quits: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors) (Quit: trevors)
[03:36:17] <piou> but I guess it doesn't have the same traditionnal flair for gals
[03:36:28] <piou> they rarely wear it outside the office
[03:36:33] *** Joins: nuclearg1 (~nucleargr@user/nuclearg1)
[03:37:14] <piou> I should try making a knife-proof vest and waistcoat

[03:37:29] <piou> kevlar can't be that hard to use
[03:37:38] <LILO[m]> I don't think knife-proof is worth it..
[03:37:50] <piou> not much guns where I'm from
[03:37:50] <LILO[m]> I would never carry anything beyond pepper spray on me!
[03:38:27] <LILO[m]> My self-defense rules are: wear things you can run in, be with friends, don't bring you ID and credit card etc.. just phone and cash and false id..
[03:38:44] <piou> sounds reasonnable
[03:38:53] <LILO[m]> If you are taking advantage of knife-proof clothing....

[03:40:36] <piou> it's just that I wouldn't make fun of you wanting kevlar leggings given that people often commented the fact that I always wear security boots, but then I got run over the foot twice so I was really glad I decided to go the extra mile
[03:41:00] <LILO[m]> twice!!! ogm
[03:41:02] *** Quits: nuclearg1 (~nucleargr@user/nuclearg1) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:41:05] <LILO[m]>  * twice!!! omg
[03:41:30] <piou> same goes for knife-proofing clothes, I've never needed it, I don't need it, but who knows, might be fun and if it turns out useful i'll be damn glad
[03:41:41] <LILO[m]> Well I also dance a lot and sit on the ground and kevlar is just forever leggings!
[03:42:02] *** Quits: SANCLA (~SANCLA@hackalot/deelnemer/Sancla) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:42:14] <piou> also sounds like hot and uncomfortable leggings, but maybe that's just the idea I have of it
[03:42:26] <piou> not much of a leggings person myself
[03:42:28] <LILO[m]> Well they are hybird kevlar...
[03:42:53] <LILO[m]> It's stretchy kevlar with some of the elastic fibers 🙂
[03:43:03] <piou> hmm
[03:43:14] <piou> sounds like an interesting material
[03:43:33] <piou> not sure it retains much of the kevlar properties though
[03:43:40] <piou> I'm curious
[03:43:44] <LILO[m]> yes..
[03:43:57] <LILO[m]> hmmm
[03:44:40] <piou> that's primarily advertisez for motorbikes it seems
[03:45:00] <LILO[m]> yes! Actually I found them on a motorcycle website!
[03:46:07] <piou> then it should be quite resistant
[03:46:24] <LILO[m]> I don't think they tested it.
[03:46:29] <piou> buy two, stab one with a knife
[03:46:39] <piou> (preferably without a leg in it)
[03:46:58] <LILO[m]> or buy one, stab it, and return it hahaha
[03:47:00] <LILO[m]> "Refund!!" 😆
