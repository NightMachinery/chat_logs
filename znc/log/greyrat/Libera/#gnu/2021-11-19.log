[04:18:47] <iShareFreedom> we defend the free software, no opensource, becouse opensource isnt about freedom for have the control of your computing trace987
[04:19:04] <iShareFreedom> i recommend you use free software trace987
[04:19:23] <trace987> okay, then do not answer this to me for open source but for free software
[04:19:35] <iShareFreedom> only with free software in full, you can have the control of your computing
[04:19:38] <kittyblam> If I am reading that correctly, apart from what iShareFreedom said about the fact this is the *free* software area and not *"""open-source"""* , change doesn't happen from the top down like that, so much as from the bottom up.
[04:19:39] <jxself> When you frame and think in terms of "freedom" software rather than "open source" software you can come to different conclusions.
[04:20:09] <iShareFreedom> with nonfree software, with nonfree firmware, blobs etc, you cant have the control of your computing trace987

[04:23:02] <jxself> Or to have someone else do that for you.

[04:23:15] *** Joins: xiews (~wxie@124.77.91.17)
[04:23:18] <jxself> Well, freedom 0 is only about running not changing.
[04:23:28] <trace987> I know all that basic knowledge what you are telling me for lots of years, I am using Linux for 23 years
[04:23:39] <kittyblam> trace987: often they use licensing like the GPL to protect them, allowing them to modify or fork away from corporate influence. Imo its a useful but incomplete move that will eventually also require an adaptation to a social domain license, but even without that there is some protections.
[04:23:41] <trace987> I am a Gentoo user
[04:23:41] <jxself> So this would be exercising freedom #1 to change the program and then freedom #3 to share the modified version with others.
[04:23:44] <iShareFreedom> the second one, is: change or modify the software how you wish trace987
[04:24:00] <trace987> I know most of that what you are telling me
[04:24:03] <iShareFreedom> you say linux, as a kernel or you are speaking about the GNU System?

[04:24:36] <trace987> that was not my question
[04:24:54] <trace987> my problem is neither about free software nor about open source

[04:25:17] <iShareFreedom> that dont exist with freedom software
[04:25:22] <jxself> Free software isn't anti-money.
[04:25:31] <iShareFreedom> free software is freedom to sell too
[04:25:32] <kittyblam> iShareFreedom: that is incorrect, its an issue
[04:25:36] <iShareFreedom> if you cant sell it isnt free software.
[04:25:42] <jxself> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html
[04:25:47] <trace987> money and power does not care if your software is anti money or not
[04:25:51] <iShareFreedom> if you cant sell free software, isnt free software trace987
[04:26:08] <trace987> what I ask is beyond selling or not
[04:26:17] <jxself> Then what do you ask? Because it is not clear to me.
[04:26:37] <trace987> my question is related to power or money
[04:26:40] <iShareFreedom> you cant have influence, becouse you dont have the control of the copy of others trace987
[04:26:54] <trace987> so could also ask that for propreitary commercial closed source software
[04:27:00] <jxself> But what *is* the question? Not what the question is related to. :)
[04:27:06] <kittyblam> trace987: this is my biggest issue with the free software movement, by sticking too literally to an arbitrary set of rules rather than using critical thinking, they relinquish themselves to corporate influence. Luckily things like the GPL aren't the worst about it and give secondary protections as problems occur but still is an incomplete solution.
[04:27:17] <kittyblam> jxself: I am also curious, having a hard time understanding as well
[04:27:47] <trace987> how can someone with money or power do something against someone else with money or power
[04:28:07] <trace987> when their battlefield is code
[04:28:10] <iShareFreedom> trace987 you with all money of the world cant change my copy
[04:28:11] <kittyblam> they usually won't, usually if you have money and power you don't give a damn
[04:28:14] <jxself> That's too vague and general of a question.
[04:28:36] <iShareFreedom> becouse when you have a copy of free software, you are the owner of the copy trace987
[04:28:52] <trace987> jxself, how shall I describe it more precise ? it is about security
[04:29:06] <trace987> what I ask is related to the whole snowden thing
[04:29:19] <jxself> I don't know how you can describe it bnetter since you haven't described in (in my view) very well to begin with.
[04:29:19] <trace987> all I mean is the whole snowden problem
[04:29:36] <kittyblam> trace987: oh yeah in free software the situation is a lot better than outside of it
[04:29:54] <iShareFreedom> the only way for have control of your computing is with exclusive free as in freedom software
[04:29:56] <trace987> someone with money or power can go to a distribution and let them make everything he wants, everything
[04:30:09] <trace987> someone else want to stop that something like this happens
[04:30:19] <iShareFreedom> yes, and you have the control for donwload it and run how you with trace987
[04:30:25] <iShareFreedom> see debian
[04:30:28] <kittyblam> trace987: not necessarily, although, occasionally that is an issue *cough* linux *cough*
[04:30:31] <iShareFreedom> compare it with trisquel
[04:30:36] <iShareFreedom> and compare linux
[04:30:39] <iShareFreedom> with linux-libre
[04:30:45] <iShareFreedom> that is the power of the real freedom
[04:30:50] <trace987> what if they kill developers if they don't do what the powerful say?
[04:31:37] <critr> trace987, 1. they can influence legislation, 2. they can pay for public propaganda campaigns, 3. they can influence le and ic, 4. they can hire hackers or hacker groups. that's just off the top of my head. i'm not sure this is the right place to discuss it, though.
[04:32:04] <trace987> they can kill developer 1
[04:32:08] <trace987> then kill developer 2
[04:32:15] <trace987> and then number 3 is gone
[04:32:44] <iShareFreedom> what is your question trace097
[04:32:54] <jxself> Yes, governments have militaries. They can use them to kill people. I am not sure what we can do about that with software.
[04:33:06] <trace987> how someone with power or money can stop that happen
[04:33:07] <kittyblam> I also am not aware of any active genocide of developers
[04:33:17] <kittyblam> so I dont see where you are going with this
[04:33:30] <jxself> Have an even bigger military?
[04:33:31] <trace987> kittyblam, because this is kept secret
[04:33:51] <trace987> jxself, how does that work practically
[04:33:57] <jxself> I don't know.
[04:34:04] <trace987> okay
[04:34:06] <trace987> thank you
[04:34:25] <critr> assassination is always apossibility but power will usually take the path of least resistance, and assassination carries a lot of risk.
[04:34:31] <jxself> I am not sure that there is an answer to your question within the context of GNU about how we can stop a government from killing people. It seems outside the scope of the GNU Project.
[04:34:56] <trace987> there is someone from whom I think that he has been killed because of that
[04:35:23] <trace987> but the battlefield is code
[04:35:41] <trace987> and code can also do something by its own
[04:35:47] <jxself> Maybe but that should probably be addressed through other channels right? I don't see how code can stop governments from killing a person.
[04:36:02] <trace987> it can
[04:36:08] <trace987> because code can also generate money
[04:36:13] <jxself> That is more legal, legislative, etc.
[04:36:19] <trace987> no one could have believed this before: bitcoin
[04:36:23] *** Quits: HawkinsTheWizard (~HawkinsTh@41.193.80.221) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[04:36:49] <jxself> You plan to flash a bitcoin wallet and that will stop the guns from shooting the person?
[04:37:02] <trace987> no, I have another logic
[04:37:03] <jxself> "Stop! I have bitcoin!"
[04:37:28] <trace987> you put something in my mouth, that I did not say
[04:38:43] <trace987> murder does not help against the bitcoin blockchain
[04:39:13] <trace987> so there could be possibilies that can be done by software, that we do not know yet
[04:39:26] <jxself> Also, the bitcoin blockchain cannot stop a murder.
[04:39:34] <trace987> it can
[04:39:52] <trace987> there was a blockchain project that has been closed for that reason
[04:40:13] <trace987> because it could have had revealed unjust things
[04:40:24] <trace987> it was about ethics or law or whatsoever
[04:40:27] <trace987> not about money
[04:40:30] <trace987> and there is more
[04:40:46] <trace987> there is a news producing project that is also blockchain based
[04:41:06] <trace987> but the powerful and rich could also do something against that
[04:41:13] <trace987> but not against their blockchain
[04:41:36] <trace987> so if you have power you can stop murder
[04:41:43] <trace987> and blockchain can give you power

[22:57:42] <apteryx> re my sed challenge; this does it: sed '/./{H;$!d} ; x ; s/^.*native-headless.*$//'
[22:58:01] <apteryx> it relies on the test(...) expression being in a paragraph, and seds out the whole paragraph
[23:03:49] <GNUHacker> fixed! the package was "sound-theme-freedesktop"
