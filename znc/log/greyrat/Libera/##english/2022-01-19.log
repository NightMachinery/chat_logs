[17:46:12] <TimMc> That would be surprising.
[17:47:38] <pussipupu> Not if a petrol station were marked on the map and houses grew around it and people assumed it was the settlement name
[17:48:58] <TimMc> This is a major port city.
[17:49:32] <TimMc> (meaning, definitely predates gas companies)

[20:09:38] <saffaffi> I'm from the UK, and if I saw that on a website, I wouldn't have any trouble understanding what it meant. But I think in the UK the equivalent word tends to be "hire", e.g. "tool hire"

[20:13:27] <nickel715> "Die älteren Menschen aus der Gruppe hatten Schwierigkeiten mit der Nutzung der Technik."
[20:13:28] <nickel715> Deepl translated that like this: "The older people in the group had difficulty using the technology."

[23:39:10] <TimMc> I wasn't sure if "an" was dialect. :-)
[23:39:10] <blkshp> But this is Jean-Luc Picards recitation.
[23:39:14] <TimMc> hah
[23:39:59] <TimMc> Possibly he's talking about repainting a parking lot divider line after someone vandalized it.

[23:40:22] <TimMc> "No, jesus, no, no farther! The parking spot is only so long!"
[23:41:36] <blkshp> I know every word of this film lol
[23:41:47] <blkshp> and all the inflections.
[23:45:53] <TimMc> I've never seen it.
[23:46:06] <blkshp> Get out
[23:46:10] <blkshp> You're banned.

[23:47:09] <TimMc> d-:
[23:47:16] <blkshp> Watched any Star Trek at all?!
[23:47:31] <Guest13> TimMc: you're just done. hit the road jack, nothing gonna come back. hit the road jack, mama ain't gonna tell you no more no more no more
[23:48:15] <TimMc> Sure, once a week as a kid my mom would make pizza, we'd turn to channel 35 and futz with the bowtie antenna for about 10 minutes, and then we'd eat dinner in front of the TV watching Star Trek.
[23:48:31] <blkshp> Any Next Generation?
[23:48:36] <TimMc> (channel 35 didn't come in real clear)
[23:48:47] <blkshp> When I was a kid we had 4 channels.
[23:48:49] <TimMc> No idea. I didn't catch which series it was.
[23:48:56] <TimMc> Yeah, we had like... 2 or 3.
[23:49:27] <blkshp> You should watch Star Trek the next generation. Then The movies. The movies are good.
[23:49:29] <TimMc> PBS, NBC, and FOX. (I *think* Star Trek was on FOX. I know The Simpsons was.)
[23:49:42] <blkshp> Especially Wrath of hlan.
[23:49:46] <blkshp> khan*
[23:49:54] <TimMc> I've seen one of the recent movies. It was OK. Watching it in the IMAX theater was a bad choice.
[23:50:19] <blkshp> I have it all memorised. I am a non-collecting trek nerdf.
[23:50:22] <blkshp> nerd.
[23:50:48] <TimMc> A space movie theoretically could be a great match for IMAX, but anything with closeup, fast-moving fight/battle scenes is utterly unwatchable.
[23:51:03] <TimMc> I'm also just not much of a movies person.
[23:51:07] <blkshp> We have different definitions of unwatchable.

[23:52:53] <mdogg> I never really got into Star Trek but one film I *loved* was "The Wrath of Khan" from the early 1980's.  I was a little kid when it came out and the scene with that weird bug inside the helmet - I thought that was *so* cool..
[23:53:15] <blkshp> my 3rd favourite
[23:53:29] <mdogg> Which were your first and second?
[23:53:56] <blkshp> First Contact and then The Undiscovered Country. 8 and 6. (TWOK is 2)
[23:55:00] <mdogg> Spock was my favorite character. 
[23:55:18] <blkshp> "is"
[23:55:26] <mdogg> Yep
[23:55:53] <blkshp> I don't know why, i have just always loved star trek, since i was 3 years old watching TNG with  my grandmother.
[23:56:19] <mdogg> Is that the original one series?
[23:56:24] <blkshp> No.
[23:56:27] <mdogg> Oh
[23:57:23] <blkshp> Star Trek 1967 - 3 series. The Next Generation - 1987, 7 series. Deep Space 9 - 1992 I think, 7 seasons. Voyager 1997 - 7 seasons. Enterprise 2001 - 4 seasons.
[23:57:50] <blkshp> Discovery, current - 4 seasons ongoing. Picard, current, 2nd season upcoming.
[23:59:12] <mdogg> My dad used to watch the original series all the time and sometimes I'd watch it with him.  Picard is my favorite captain.  
[23:59:24] <mdogg> I didn't like Kirk.
[23:59:57] <blkshp> The original series is my least favourite. Just because I wasn't there at that time and it's still sexist and over the top.
