[00:27:44] <johnjay> well. i picked debian arm64 netinst iso
[00:27:55] <johnjay> does arm not come with sudo and x86_64 does?
[00:28:07] <sney> there is a stage in the installer when you decide whether to install sudo
[00:28:13] *** Quits: Alxlight (~Alxlight@user/alxlight) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:28:16] <sney> if you didn't read the dialogs, it's possible you ended up with no sudo
[00:28:17] <johnjay> i didn't see that
[00:28:19] <greycat> Whether you used netinst or DVD-1 makes no difference in determining what is installed. The choices you make during installation determine what's installed.
[00:28:37] <greycat> if you want to install sudo now, just install it
[00:28:48] <at0m> johnjay: if you do not pick a root pass during installation, sudo will be installed. if you do, it doesn't, by default
[00:29:10] <johnjay> ... really?
[00:29:23] <johnjay> i thought you had to make a root password
[00:29:29] <sney> this is why reading helps :)
[00:29:38] <sney> the installer explains this for you, right on the screen in front of you
[00:29:48] <somiaj> It is more, if you give root a password, sudo won't be installed, if you don't give root a password, sudo will be installed, so it is an implicit choice.

[00:52:25] <johnjay> do i inherit its permissions or vice versa/
[00:52:36] <somiaj> so if you have a root password (Thus didn't disable root login), no need for sudo
[00:52:56] <greycat> with a GUI login, the top of the process tree is the X session.  The window manager, desktop environment, etc. all inherit from that.

[02:03:14] <greycat> are you sure it wasn't NTP moving the clock?
[02:03:15] <sussudio> it's a conspiracy.
[02:03:18] <PMT> It gets to about 0.64 seconds since boot in things printed out, then doesn't print anything for 50+ seconds, then starts printing things it claims are 0.71 seconds and on.
[02:03:26] <PMT> greycat: no, I watched it in realtime.
[02:03:31] <PMT> It just didn't move for over 50 seconds.
[02:03:43] <PMT> And this is, I think, before init.
[02:03:53] <PMT> So I doubt it's NTP's fault unless Linux grew some very exciting bits.

[11:37:51] <PMT> PPAs are an Ubuntu thing. I have seen people post packages intended for Debian use on them, but very rarely, and there's no standard tooling afaik for using them in Debian.

[11:38:35] <dpkg> [ppa] Personal Package Archive (see https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas or <launchpad>).  PPAs are either: (a) an easy way to grab packages based on nightly-builds/VCS snapshots or (b) an easy way for any idiot to publish a package of extremely poor quality (remember, you will run the maintainer scripts as root during install!).  Choose your repos wisely.  No equivalent exists for Debian yet.  Ask me about <why not use a ppa>.

[18:02:15] <kittonian> hi all. is anyone familiar with proftpd? on my old server I compiled it from source and it was great, but on this new one I figured I would use apt to install it. I have it up and running but mod_dnsbl does not work no matter what I've tried. I even grabbed the source and compiled it just to see if I would get the mod_dnsbl.c file (which I do) but all the modules from apt are .so and mod_dnsbl.so is in /usr/lib/proftpd
[18:02:49] <kittonian> can't figure it out. on top of that, it's a bit confusing since the modules.conf file is saying to load modulename.c but there is no modulename.c, only modulename.so
