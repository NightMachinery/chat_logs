[10:42:35] <Josh_2> Can't launch when cloned from master :(
[10:55:57] <Josh_2> How do I stop nyxt from repl?
[11:11:37] <Josh_2> There are some really irritating aspects about starting from repl. Would be really nice if there was a restart available for stopping Nyxt if you try to start it when its already running

[12:41:09] <Josh_2> Okay I seem to have gotten everything to load with headless but document-model is nil in my buffer :(
[13:27:35] <Josh_2> I just had to hunt down a type error in prompter cos I have safety 3, speed 0, on my sbcl

[13:28:48] <Josh_2> just (or null function) works
[13:29:22] <Josh_2> After all that hullabaloo my from source version of Nyxt works :(
[13:29:39] <Josh_2> Now to see if i can make it run headless

[19:04:18] <Josh_2> Is headless mode ready yet?
[19:04:59] <Josh_2> Doesn't seem to work for me, I spent a good 3/4 hours fighting with it using my own hacks and it seems to get stuck in a gtk function which I dont have the foggiest idea how to fix

[19:06:49] <aartaka> Wow, that's a lot.
[19:07:54] <Josh_2> I dont know what sbcl compiler policies you have set, but I have mine at speed 0 safety 3 debug 3 and I couldn't run prompter
[19:08:03] <Josh_2> I had to go and change :type in one of slots

[20:02:32] <Josh_2> https://imgur.com/8uEuiVr.png
[20:05:30] <aartaka> Josh_2: In no normal scenario should `current-buffer` return nil. Something should be terribly broken if it does.
[20:05:45] <Josh_2> Well..
[20:05:55] <Josh_2> Something was terribly broken, prompter
[20:06:03] <Josh_2> because it has a bad type specifier
[20:06:03] <aartaka> 0_o
[20:06:17] <Josh_2> And SBCL immediately throws an error when it runs the type check for that slot
[20:06:24] <aartaka> I see.
[20:06:39] <Josh_2> An error saying that the type specifier is invalid, not that the slot-value is the wrong type
[20:06:52] <Josh_2> Once I fixed that I was able to actually shut the history buffer xD
[20:06:58] <aartaka> I guess my desire to type everything as rigorously as possible is a bit unreasonable :D
[20:07:12] <Josh_2> Well the default sbcl policy is safety 2 I think
[20:07:18] <Josh_2> so it doesn't do type checks for slots in classes
[20:07:32] <aartaka> Josh_2: I'll be glad to accelt a PR if you send one!
[20:07:46] <Josh_2> In nyxt or prompter?
[20:08:00] <Josh_2> because you have promper as a library shipped with nyxt
[20:08:55] <aartaka> Josh_2: ptompter is not a separate repository (yet).
[20:09:12] <aartaka> It's just rediding in a separate directory in Nyxt source tree.

[20:12:18] <Josh_2> Its unfortunate that I have 0 idea about the webkit stuff, I really really really want it to work headless :(
[20:12:25] <waleee> more pressure on the keys!
[20:12:38] <lagash> More RSI!

[20:12:43] <aartaka> xD
[20:13:13] <waleee> the typing should double as a workout!
[20:13:46] <Josh_2> Oh I also made a special class for the headless browser

[20:27:50] <aartaka> Ah hell.
[20:27:53] <Josh_2> I believe that safety has to be greater than speed to enable proper type checking

[20:28:31] <Josh_2> "If speed, space or compilation-speed is more important than safety, then type checking is weakened"
[20:28:34] <waleee> heh, even when compiling the image?
[20:28:55] <Josh_2> This epicly bit me in the arse the other day
[20:29:21] <Josh_2> I had an image that was compiled with the default compiler policy, I then recompiled and was greeted with a lot of type errors xD
[20:29:37] <Josh_2> spent an hour going through and correcting my shitty type declarations
[20:30:26] <waleee> that might explain some errors I had when I experimented with a global .sbclrc
[20:30:42] <waleee> * errors with nyxt
[20:31:28] <waleee> I went with the "nuclear" option and removed that declaim
[20:31:31] <Josh_2> I think the correct policy would be to restrict yourself to maximum safety and type checking when writing the application then when everything works nicely and tests pass then the compiler policy can be oriented toward speed
[20:31:38] <Josh_2> for the deployed application
[20:31:54] <Josh_2> like deploying the Nyxt app with safety 1 speed 3 or something
[20:32:31] <Josh_2> it would be interesting to see if there is a difference that the user can 'feel'
[20:33:43] <Josh_2> has much profiling been done on Nyxt when its running?
