[02:00:59] <CaesarNaykid> ok. so, i messed around with x2go for a few and decided to not go that route, instead, i've installed TigerVNC
[02:01:31] <CaesarNaykid> now, i'm looking to figure out how to secure shh tunnel connect to it
[02:01:47] *** Joins: XV8 (~XV8@2601:5cb:c001:50::c80f)
[02:01:53] <CaesarNaykid> do i need to do something in my router for that?
[02:02:17] <CaesarNaykid> ..to connect remotely
[02:02:18] *** Joins: vbgunz (~vbgunz@35.141.71.47)
[02:02:36] <ta180m> You should tunnel the VNC port 5901 over SSH
[02:02:39] <ta180m> since VNC doesn't have any encryption
[02:02:53] <uwharrie> or you could skip VNC and use ssh's X forwarding
[02:03:12] <CaesarNaykid> is that something i'm doing from the server terminal?
[02:03:20] <akik> x11 forwarding is slow
[02:04:36] *** Quits: vdamewood (~vdamewood@fedora/vdamewood) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:04:39] <CaesarNaykid> is x11 forwarding what uwharrie just suggested?
[02:04:57] <ta180m> x11 forwarding is only usable over a LAN
[02:05:16] *** Joins: vdamewood (~vdamewood@fedora/vdamewood)
[02:05:20] <CaesarNaykid> so, X forwarding and x11 forwarding is the same thing?
[02:05:36] <CaesarNaykid> ie xsession
[02:05:37] *** Joins: otisolsen70 (~otisolsen@xd4ed80b5.cust.hiper.dk)
[02:05:51] <CaesarNaykid> still getting familiar with these things
[02:06:08] <uwharrie> yes, people often drop the 11
[02:06:30] <CaesarNaykid> "You should tunnel the VNC port 5901 over ssh" do you mean in my router or is that something i need to execute from the server terminal
[02:06:48] <another|> ta180m: X forwarding is barely usable in any case. compression helps a bit
[02:07:01] <CaesarNaykid> i will try anything that works at this point
[02:07:18] <ta180m> another|: I use X11 forwarding every day with a server on my LAN and it works fine
[02:07:23] <CaesarNaykid> but, have gotten alot of recommendations in the past to use VNC so i'm going that approach currently
[02:07:34] <akik> CaesarNaykid: ssh -L localport:localhost:5901 user@host
[02:08:05] <akik> caseih: then you can connect to localport on your local machine
[02:08:10] <CaesarNaykid> would like to try this approach, then i'll install Debian later on my win11 PC dual boot and try the other with my ubuntu install here at the house to experiment
[02:08:21] <ta180m> Another thing you could try is xrdp which in my experience works the best out of the different protocols
[02:08:29] <ta180m> it even has opengl and vulkan support

I'm continually grateful for FOSS for that reason, and also I'm keenly aware of the volunteers who give their personal time to make it all possible. So, when I contribute, I'm trying to make it better, even in a little way.

[05:11:57] <jack_rabbit> CaesaerNaykid, The reason X11 is so slow has to do with how the protocol is designed. It's not limited by bandwidth, which has grown incredibly since X11 was invented. It's limited by latency. That won't change much no matter how much bandwidth grows.

[05:42:14] <Lebela> guys, I have done something for a really long time, and I am fed up, looking for a better solution
[05:42:18] <hkm> it's working a bit iffy
[05:42:27] <CaesarNaykid> I changed the SSH port from 22 to 5901
[05:42:50] <Lebela> So, I have 3 external hard drives, all LUKS encrypted.  When I mount them,  I always look at the output of the "syslog" to know what /dev/ device it is
[05:43:08] <Lebela> then I manually mount these LUKS encrypted hard drives to a specified mount point
[05:43:32] <Lebela> sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdc1 foo
[05:43:44] <ayecee> craaazy
[05:43:46] <Lebela> sudo mount /dev/mapper/foo /mnt/foo
[05:43:51] <Lebela> so, this is what I have been doing for years
[05:43:55] <Lebela> I am so fed up with it.
[05:43:59] <ayecee> i bet!
[05:44:13] <Lebela> there is a way to do it via /etc/fstab,  but the devices always change
[05:44:26] <Lebela> sometimes, the first HD I plug in is sdb1 sometimes sdc1
[05:44:28] <ayecee> that's why people no longer use device names

[05:47:39] <Lebela> lemme check that out.  brb
[05:47:44] <ayecee> i think lsblk shows the uuid for partitions, or at least can
[05:48:23] <ayecee> I'd probably google up some crypttab examples too

[05:52:26] <Lebela> ayecee, what if I were to plug in the HD later?
[05:52:45] <Dagmar> Bind your udev rule to the drive's serial nmber if you like
[05:52:54] <ayecee> i reckon cryptsetup uses crypttab to set up devices
[05:52:59] <Dagmar> Any attribute that shows up when you use the udev monitor to watch udev events is fair game
[05:53:18] <hkm> What command or /proc file can I inspect to learn about my gpu?
[05:53:36] <ayecee> what do you want to learn about your gpu
[05:54:02] <Lebela> Dagmar, there's a lot of information in your last two comments, I must google some of it (e.g. the udev monitor) - gimme time - and thank you!
[05:54:10] <hkm> I am not sure what gpu this device is using.
[05:54:23] <Dagmar> Just... for obvious reasons, pick an attribute that's _unique_
[05:54:33] <ayecee> i don't know offhand how to have cryptsetup open a device defined in crypttab
[05:55:03] <Lebela> wait, I have an idea!! Maybe I could make my whole life much easier!

[05:55:42] <Lebela> sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdc1 foo
[05:55:44] <jensen> takes over a minute to boot on my samsung 850 pro, is this normal for my setup? systemd-analyze blame: https://0x0.st/oPsA.txt . it's 2 LUKS-encrypted 8TB drives in RAID-1, a 500GB encrypted drive, and my 500GB SSD on / so I understand it can take some time
[05:55:49] <Dagmar> Probably, if that's visible when the thing is already unlocked
[05:55:53] <ayecee> maybe it would be like mount, where you specify the mountpoint and it figures out the device from fstab
[05:56:29] <ayecee> so you might tell cryptsetup to open a device by its mapper name, and it gets the uuid from crypttab

[06:19:29] <Psi-Jack> CaesarNaykid: Great!
[06:19:30] <Dagmar> Oh look.  Free range idjits
[06:19:33] <jensen> should i get usb 3.0/c flash drive or get a SATA SSD + SATA to USB adapter for raspberry pi? i'm already running OS on flash drive for the pi. USB interface maybe not reliable for long term storage so if I go the latter, it is more versatile because at least I can use it as a scratch disk for my PC in the future (or maybe upgrade SBC to one that supports SATA natively

[06:30:27] <CaesarNaykid> i'm guessing maybe because the local user is logged in on GNOME
[06:30:37] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, Gnome isn't designed for remote desktop use.
[06:31:05] <CaesarNaykid> the icons and menu are kind of glitchy though like this
[06:31:08] <Dagmar> Lebela: I don't particularly "do" hand-holding.  Run `udevadm monitor -p | tee logfile.txt` as root and plug in a drive.  You will get a whole slew of stuff going on in that file, including a list of everything udev considers an "event" as well as the properties associated with each device as udev sees it
[06:31:49] <Dagmar> Stop the command, and run it again with a different file while you invoke cryptsetup luksOpen.

[11:55:21] <node1> yes i agree.
[11:55:48] <labrador> node1, do you have any experience in reverse engineering?

[13:01:44] <otisolsen70> I run "pidof restic" multiple times with a few seconds in between. Most of the time, pidof returns nothing. But sometimes it does return a PID. And the PID is the same. So it is not that I have multiple instances starting/stopping of the process. And looking at htop, the program is indeed running all through the test.

[13:21:51] <labrador> I think its similar to using /dev/sda for stuff
[13:21:54] <lopid> like sda vs id
[13:21:54] <labrador> It can change
[13:21:56] <mlu> but bus and slot order isn't very predictable when it comes to USB
[13:22:01] <labrador> oh

[13:22:19] <mlu> but if you have a USB port, good luck :P
[13:22:38] <labrador> If we don't change hardware even eth would give the same results every boot
[13:22:45] <mlu> I personally think it's quite stupid: this whole predictable names thing -- otherwise, it could just be detection order on boot
[13:23:33] <mlu> you'd imagine you'd have a fancier way of doing the predictable device names anyways if it truly mattered to you

[17:21:19] <BluesKaj> Hi folks
[17:21:39] <SaltHilStroller_> How does padding work across different architectures? If I'm transferring data between 32bit and 64bit architectures, does that affect the memory offset when accessing a struct member?
[17:21:59] <hexnewbie> SaltHilStroller_: long is a different size, and so is void*
[17:22:39] <ayecee> so, yes
[17:23:17] *** Quits: Nimzowitsch (~nimzo@user/nimzowitsch) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[17:23:27] <SaltHilStroller_> hexnewbie: Thankfully it's mostly just unsigned ints. I'm experiencing a weird issue where I create and populate a struct on the 32 bit system, then try to read the value on the 64 bit struct, it's just garbage. Think I've finally narrowed down the issue to padding
[17:23:29] <ayecee> part of why we don't normally punt bare structs out over the network
[17:23:44] <hodapp> SaltHilStroller_: if you just transfer raw bytes from memory on one architecture, yes, another architecture might have problems reading it
[17:23:49] <hexnewbie> I also suppose they would be aligned and padded to a different offset, because 64 bit, but I've not dealt with padding directly except on packed structs where I did so myself
[17:24:02] <hexnewbie> So that's just an educated guess
[17:24:03] <hodapp> or, for instance, something that is totally kosher (but slightly slower) on x86 might cause a hard-fault on ARM
[17:24:21] <SaltHilStroller_> hodapp: Okay thankfully it's 32bit arm to 64 bit arm
[17:24:42] <ayecee> heh, or mysteriously rotated values.
[17:24:44] <SaltHilStroller_> hexnewbie: Yeah, I think packed structs are the way to go
[17:24:52] <hodapp> but in general, if you are wanting to reliably send structs over the wire or save them to disk, pick one of the many many tools that handles the details of this for you
[17:25:11] <hexnewbie> SaltHilStroller_: For network packets, I think you need packet structs and htonl/ntohl stuff
[17:25:20] <hodapp> e.g. protobuf, msgpack, capnproto
[17:25:29] <ayecee> SaltHilStroller_: you'd think so, but they're not. properly serialized structs are the way to go.

[19:31:15] <VSpike> I'm looking at this program `tlog-rec` and trying to figure out how it handles the child process when it gets a signal. If I use it to start a shell, and set up traps for SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGTERM and EXIT, then send a SIGTERM to the `tlog-rec` process, the shell exits without any message or hitting any traps ...

[23:50:00] <sharkyflips> Hi, a year ago I saw on the ubuntu software center, an app that you could load images into and it would look at the exif location data and it would plot the images on a map kinda like a path, Is it a figment of my memories, or real, and if so, what is it called? Thanks in advance.
[23:50:12] <msiism> I guess reading a book on Boolean Algebra and then building a basic computer out of wood is also time well spent.
[23:50:13] <Guest3867> good, debian seems a good candidate: a second one? I was told "fedora, arch and gentoo"; other opinion?

[23:50:56] <lispy> Make a Linux distro truly from scratch, starting with a pickaxe and a fire. That way you can get all the customisation you could want

[23:56:30] <Dagmar> ...and it's more a matter of once you set up OBS you don't really have to dork with it anymore, beyond occasionally moving the rectangle if you're trying to only capture _part_ of a screen

[23:59:24] <Dagmar> OpenSUSE is upstream from SUSE.  Not the other way around.
[23:59:29] <koollman> I do not know how much opensuse and suse are related or share the same people
[23:59:33] <uwharrie> fine then. Yes, Microsoft is purposefully injecting security vulnerabilities into OpenSUSE /s
