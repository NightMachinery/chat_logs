[17:01:28] <Remosi> river, at work we had a bug where a new version of less(1) would crash when it got to EOF for some weird, complicated reason
[17:02:33] <Remosi> river, so we now have a simple thing that opens a pty, forks less using the pty, sends "G" to it, waits until it sees "(END)" come back, then exits successfully
[17:02:57] <Remosi> it's not a fantastic test, but it fixes a postmortem AI ("we should test this before we roll it out everywhere")
[17:03:08] <Remosi> and at least catches that class of problem
[17:04:21] <Remosi> oh, I think it sends "q" after it sees "(END)"
[17:04:36] <Remosi> and waits for less to exit successfully

[17:05:54] <Remosi> I think people have adapted it for some other programs (eg vi, read a file, jump to the end of the file, save the file, then quit)
[17:06:05] <Remosi> we don't check the actual screen output is anything sensible
[17:06:22] <Remosi> basically dumb expect like stuff
[17:08:25] *** Joins: kaivai (~kaivai@user/kaivai)
[17:08:35] <river> that's pretty cool though!
[17:08:45] <river> if you can get by without doing all that extra work
[17:10:17] <Remosi> I think it's basically just call forkpty()
[17:10:41] <Remosi> it covers a lot of the problems we've seen - which is generally programs crash due to link errors or missing symbols or other weird things
[17:10:53] <Remosi> but less, and vi are generally pretty battle hardened
[17:11:14] <Remosi> they may not have active testing, but they get a lot of hours of usage around the world every day
[17:11:35] <river> yeah there is that
[17:11:38] <river> feels like a cop out :P
[17:11:41] <river> but its valid
[17:11:42] <Remosi> it is a bit
[17:11:44] <river> just have a big userbase
[17:11:49] <river> no need for tests
[17:11:59] <Remosi> for our case it was covering things like the version of ncurses didn't work with the version of libc
[17:12:03] <Remosi> and other weird things like that
[17:12:07] <river> ahh
[17:12:10] <Remosi> coz we suck at dependency management
[17:12:48] <Remosi> but now we have a framework, if someone complains about some other rollout
[17:12:52] <Remosi> we can build more tests into it
[17:13:31] <Remosi> I'd be inclined to do something like send ^L (refresh screen), and understand just enough to parse the escape codes after that to rebuild a "screenshot" and match it against a template
[17:13:35] <Remosi> or something if we ever needed to
[17:13:40] <Remosi> but so far we haven't
[17:14:33] <Remosi> but yeah, if you want to integration test an ncurses program, that's how I'd go about it

[22:51:16] <shapr> It was Hasselby Strand, but I still miss it.
[22:51:53] <gerikson> haha :D
[22:52:17] <gerikson> no, it was used to "explain" why one of the female hostages didn't feel safe from the police
