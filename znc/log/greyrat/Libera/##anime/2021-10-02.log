[02:38:44] <MootPoot> sometimes I like to imagine that drinking brisk lemonade is like drinking cute girl pee
[02:43:55] <Sxem> pee has too much salt in it. its better than blood at least. blood is too salty to be of much use if youre dehydrating to death
[02:44:30] <Sxem> they never talk about that in vampire movies and tv shows
[02:44:48] <MootPoot> idk
[02:45:05] <MootPoot> the chinese ( or somebody ) make pig blood stew/soup and drink it too
[02:45:09] <MootPoot> they come out just fine

[02:46:04] <MootPoot> but in the short term you have h2o intake
[02:46:05] <Sxem> salt uses up your liquids
[02:46:21] <Sxem> thats why they cant drink ocean water on ships
[02:46:40] <Sxem> you wind up losing more liquid to the salt than you wdve if you hadnt drunk it
[02:46:42] <groovy> that and because what would the fish drink
[02:47:15] <Sxem> Seawater is toxic to humans because your body is unable to get rid of the salt
[02:47:27] <Sxem>  Your body's kidneys normally remove excess salt by producing urine, but the body needs freshwater to dilute the salt in your body for the kidneys to work properly.
[02:48:59] <Sxem> Human kidneys can only make urine that is less salty than salt water. Therefore, to get rid of all the excess salt taken in by drinking seawater, you have to urinate more water than you drank. Eventually, you die of dehydration even as you become thirstier.
[02:49:28] <Sxem> so drinking blood makes you dehydrate to death faster
[02:49:35] <Sxem> or urine
[02:50:06] <Sxem> but urine has less salt
[02:50:30] <Sxem> diabetics have sugar in their urine, so everyone in yr party shd drink that persons pee

[03:27:40] <Cryowolf> oh shit you can do that...As long as you separate the blood from the plasma with a centrifuge of some sort and then use the plasma in a distiller
[03:27:44] <Cryowolf> then you get...water

[04:07:45] <ButterNoodle> what is that
[04:07:48] <Macer> i'll watch a couple of episodes though
[04:07:55] <groovy> it's dogshit
[04:07:59] <Macer> groovy: is it?
[04:08:00] <groovy> stopped halfway through first episode
[04:08:08] <ButterNoodle> cant coom?
[04:08:14] <groovy> cgi is ugly af and the plot is not remotely compelling
[04:08:19] <Macer> i find in most anime you have to try to at least get past the 2nd episode
[04:08:35] <Macer> the first one is that quickly established who the fuck are they episode 
[04:08:48] <Macer> so it's usually clunky 
[04:09:12] <ButterNoodle> I mean that one with the hentai maid looks like shit
[04:09:25] <Macer> there's one with a hentai maid??
[04:09:33] <ButterNoodle> but it runs at the rate of 1 pantsu shot every 2 min
[04:09:48] <groovy> most cgi anime is absolute trash
[04:09:57] <groovy> only thing I can think of in a long time that I thought was good was Sidonia
[04:09:59] <Macer> groovy: ah. is that what it is? yah it has a weird look to it

[09:41:07] <Sadale> wow. The new onahole I've just opened. It brings intense orgasm. :O
[09:41:58] <Sadale> It's far more intense than my hands. And far more intense than the previous onahole that I've purchased (which's weaker than my hands).
[09:52:19] <Sadale> And it's almost as if this onahole is made for people of smaller size like me. Unlike most other onaholes that has only one hole, this onahole has two holes that you can penetrate thru. My tiny Asian cock's just able to penetrate thru the two holes with this onahole.
[09:52:54] <Sadale> Too bad it's a bit too big in diameter that I couldn't hide it inside my pringles can. I need to find an alternative solution of storing this onahole :(
[09:53:15] <Sadale> Maybe I could 3D print a storage cylinder.

[11:57:00] <MootPoot> yeah but they're trash
[11:57:04] <MootPoot> 100m or 1gbit at best
[11:57:10] <Sadale> true
[11:57:27] <Sadale> Maybe the USB protocol isn't meant to be used over a long range :P
[11:57:32] <MootPoot> so I've come to a realizaiton
[11:57:46] <MootPoot> the reason why we dont have  faster then gbit speeds in home networking
[11:57:55] <Sadale> Probably technically possible to make high speed long cable. Perhaps it's so expensive that no one bother standardizing it
[11:58:14] <MootPoot> is because even the fastest single stream wifi setup cant even come close to saturating it 
[11:58:33] <Sadale> 1Gbps is a lot anyway

[12:01:40] <MootPoot> so cut that in half
[12:01:55] <MootPoot> 600 mbit...then you throw in real life interference and stuff
[12:01:59] <Sadale> WiFi's almost never as fast as the advertised speed because you aren't the one who's occupying the wifi channel

[15:20:59] <MootPoot> same with residencial toaster ovens and residencial electric plug in heaters and portable ACs and stuff

[15:31:50] <Cryowolf> but as long as I use different outlets, it shouldn't fry anything
[15:33:46] <MootPoot> if it takes that many watts, I assume you have a dedicated AC breaker

[15:35:52] <Cryowolf> I don't know, it doesn't always go up to the maximum
[15:35:58] <Cryowolf> depends how hard it has to work
[15:36:34] <MootPoot> the max rating is usually just to accomodate the inidal load spike
[15:36:45] <Cryowolf> but I can run my tv, my computer, my AC, my oven, my fridge and freezer all at once without the breaker going off
[15:37:33] <MootPoot> yeah, usually if you have a AC with that high of a wattage, unless the electrical code in sweeden is braindead, it'll be on its own breaker and set of wires from the main panel
[15:37:41] <Cryowolf> but I dont need the AC right now, though in fan mode it actually exchanges air. So if I point it out the window and have another window open, it'll keep pulling in fresh air
[15:38:11] <Cryowolf> I just plugged it into an outlet near the only place I could put it

[16:03:13] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: what is it?
[16:03:20] <Cryowolf> If you miss potatoes you can also use Daikon to make "potato gratin" but with Daikons instead of potatoes. You need to slice them and then boil them for about 8-10 minutes I think it was. This gets rid of the bitterness
[16:03:44] <Cryowolf> the texture will then be the exact same as potatoes in the finished product but daikons have like no carbs
[16:03:57] <Cryowolf> oopsies is like a bread made for keto

[16:10:32] <Cryowolf> I didnt like the next karate kid, it felt unnecessary
[16:10:41] <amigojapan> So so zoidberg the first and second yes
[16:10:52] <Cryowolf> they had already completed it with Daniel-San in the trilogy
[16:12:14] <Cryowolf> but you should watch the series, Cobra Kai. It features the former villain from Karate Kid 1 (the kid he faced in the tournament) and Daniel-San as adults, both running their own dojos
[16:12:18] <zoidberg> amigojapan: I find it boring.
[16:12:27] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: the third movie was also not so good
[16:12:40] <amigojapan> Alright zoidberg 
[16:12:40] <Cryowolf> the series has 41 episodes so far I think
[16:13:15] <zoidberg> amigojapan: I watched the first one I think, the one that won academy award
[16:13:23] <amigojapan> I see Cryowolf I will check it out
[16:13:55] <Cryowolf> I havent seen it yet but I should because I hear it's very good
[16:14:07] <Cryowolf> a lot more complex than the movies
[16:14:25] <Cryowolf> but when you have a lot more time to tell a story you can make it a lot more complex

[16:16:56] <Cryowolf> and there's a lot of misunderstandings with Jonny forming Cobra Kai, cause he has good intentions. What made him start it was saving a kid from bullies
[16:17:02] <darkwitch> replace the actor with a vtuber
[16:17:06] <Cryowolf> so he wanted to teach the kid to defend himself
[16:17:18] <Cryowolf> but a lot of stuff apparently happens
[16:17:22] <Cryowolf> but that's the premise
[16:17:40] <Cryowolf> that's on the official uh synopsis or what it's called
[16:19:22] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: according to the karate kid movies, karate came from China
[16:19:27] <zoidberg> thinking about it, the concept is so old, isn't it?
[16:19:40] <zoidberg> I mean who does karate at schools these days?
[16:20:20] <brainwash> they don't even do simple sports
[16:20:21] <Cryowolf> karate is Japanese though
[16:20:22] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I think in Mexico it's still pretty popular
[16:20:27] <brainwash> kids getting fat
[16:20:50] <Cryowolf> Taekwondo is Korean
[16:21:00] <Cryowolf> Kung Fu or Wing Chun is Chinese
[16:21:34] <darkwitch> the kids need to eat daikon gratin
[16:21:36] <Cryowolf> Jiu Jitsu is Japanese
[16:21:44] <brainwash> and Shaolin?
[16:21:54] <amigojapan> So is aikido
[16:21:57] <Cryowolf> Shaolin is a performance art
[16:22:05] <zoidberg> I don't know about sports but kids in my apartment building play a lot
[16:22:14] <Cryowolf> much like Thai Chi
[16:22:16] <amigojapan> And kendo and kyuudo
[16:22:22] <Cryowolf> Shaolin isn't useful in fighting
[16:22:42] <brainwash> what was the martial art from Brazil? the one incorporating dance moves
[16:22:58] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, yes, though Akido has so many rules that it's very limited in its effectiveness in teaching you to actually wield a katana
[16:23:08] <Cryowolf> brainwash, Capaella or something
[16:23:44] <Cryowolf> no

[16:30:01] <Cryowolf> Was the Katana restricted to Samurai before the Meiji era or was it during the Meiji era?
[16:31:31] <Cryowolf> the Samurai are also very exaggeratedly shown as being men of honor and all that. Just like Knights. Which couldn't be further from the truth cause most considered themselves (rightfully so I suppose) above the average citizen and if a citizen stood in their way they could be cut down
[16:32:02] <Cryowolf> unless it was someone of importance, in which case I guess they would shove them out of the way
[16:32:11] <Cryowolf> but they acted pretty much just like Knights did

[16:47:16] <Matt|home> hello
[16:47:30] <Cryowolf> a recurve bow requires more skill and strength
[16:47:31] <Sadale> long time ago my stupid dad made a bow using off the shelf components. It's lame tho.
[16:47:39] <amigojapan> Hi Matt|home 
[16:47:40] *** Joins: Mr_Miser1 (~weechat@27.34.108.57)
[16:47:47] <Cryowolf> a compound bow you don't even need to grip the line
[16:47:56] <Sadale> A very simple bow. It consisted of like three components. A thick stick that's kind of bendable. A string. And an arrow that's a thinner stick.
[16:48:16] <Cryowolf> heh
[16:48:21] <Cryowolf> that is simple
[16:48:30] <Cryowolf> and basically what a recurve bow is
[16:49:10] <amigojapan> Sadale: I made a crossbow and put actual needle tips as the arrow heads
[16:49:17] <Sadale> O_o
[16:49:25] <Sadale> amigojapan, don't give it to tomako :P
[16:49:44] <amigojapan> Sadale: this was in Mexico
[16:49:44] <Cryowolf> the material, the thickness, the shape, length and the line used determines the weight to draw it and how far it will fly and how far it will penetrate a target
[16:50:07] <Cryowolf> Im thinking of buying a recurve bow and then going into middle of nowhere to practice
[16:50:08] <amigojapan> Sadale: I mean I used seringe tips
[16:50:15] <Cryowolf> because that's legal
[16:50:20] <Sadale> amigojapan, wow. That's dangerous
[16:50:24] <Sadale> Even more dangerous than normal needles
[16:50:43] <Cryowolf> there's no law forbidding me from using a bow, as long as it's not around people, against people or against animals
[16:50:43] <amigojapan> Yep Sadale 
[16:51:25] <Cryowolf> the arrows you can buy have different kind of tips but most are just points. Cause the rest would only be useful for hunting
[16:51:37] <Sadale> until you get a masochist who's try to get shot by an arrow and keep following you while you're stretching your bow.
[16:51:39] <Cryowolf> what the tips are made of though is also important
[16:51:47] <Cryowolf> since you need good balance
[16:52:05] <Cryowolf> Sadale, then I don't draw while he's around
[16:52:49] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: even a kid can buy actual syringes at a drug store in Mexico
[16:53:12] <Cryowolf> https://www.fieldandstream.com/uploads/2020/08/11/Q3NV2JY72VFVFLLIRGVHAMMMOY.jpg this is why I don't want to use a compound bow. Cause you don't even need to touch the string
[16:53:18] <ImoutoBot> [error] SSL certificate problem: certificate has expired
[16:53:38] <Cryowolf> it's also lighter to draw for the force it launches
[16:53:39] <Sadale> Same here. Here syringes are far easier to get than I thought. I once needed syringe for extracting exact amount of liquid. After some googling I found that I could easily purchase them from phamacies.
[16:54:04] <Cryowolf> you can get syringes here too, for diabetics
[16:54:13] <Sadale> I didn't need the syringe tip tho. But I have to purchase the tip along with the syringe body
[16:54:29] <Sadale> yep. I think the syringe's meant for insulin
[16:55:08] <Cryowolf> its also not illegal to purchase different tips here and if you're a diabetic the syringes are free
[16:55:16] <amigojapan> Sadale: in Japan they have special serynges for insulin, they have tiny tips

[17:04:39] <Cryowolf> that will affect the aim since your arm will jerk. Instead you hold it between your thumb and rest of your hand in a very gentle "grip" that becomes more loose the closer you are to launching the arrow

[17:32:05] <Cryowolf> Yes it is and for a country like Japan that remained isolated for such a long time, developed a mindset that is passed on through generation (though less now) which makes it hard to invoke big changes
[17:32:17] <Cryowolf> like to the law and such policies
[17:32:39] <Cryowolf> but I agree with their decision to bolster their military, even if the US protests
[17:33:26] <amigojapan> The US wanted Japan to participate in ally wars
[17:34:21] <Macer> were nuclear bombs allowed?
[17:34:25] <amigojapan> That is why I am against doing anything but self defence
[17:34:38] <amigojapan> No Macer 
[17:35:17] <Cryowolf> I think if China went afterr Japan right now, Japan would fall pretty quick cause the US is spread thin
[17:35:42] <Cryowolf> so they wont have time to come defend Japan, instead they'll be met with a blockade of Chinese ships
[17:37:16] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: the US has many bases in Japan
[17:38:14] <Cryowolf> yes but they dont have the manpower or ships or air capabilities to counter a Chinese invasion in time
[17:38:34] <Cryowolf> they've withdrawn many of their forces back near the US
[17:40:18] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: let's worry about it when and if it happens
[17:40:47] <Cryowolf> but thats when it would be too late, so it's good to bolster the defenses
[17:41:37] <Cryowolf> but I don't think it will happen, no country can afford to go to war right now
[17:42:18] <amigojapan> I am a pacifist
[17:43:34] <Cryowolf> I'm a realist and pragmatist
[17:43:49] <amigojapan> Yeah you have said so

[17:44:25] <Roey> jessedesu2: he
[17:44:26] <Roey> hey
[17:44:31] <amigojapan> jessedesu2: probably something wrong with the boot manager
[17:44:34] <Roey> how did ou partition your disk
[17:44:39] <Roey> with some bioses
[17:44:43] <jessedesu2> I give it boot flag
[17:44:47] <Roey> I found that I need to have some stupid small partition firt
[17:44:51] <Roey> jessedesu2: ok
[17:44:53] <jessedesu2> I have a bios 
[17:44:54] <Roey> *first
[17:44:56] <jessedesu2> Mbr
[17:44:57] <Roey> yeah I know
[17:45:02] <Roey> oh, ok.
[17:45:10] <Roey> and what message do you get upon boot?
[17:45:23] <amigojapan> jessedesu2: did you disable secure boot?
[17:45:41] <jessedesu2> It says to create an 8mb unformatted partition with bios boot flag
[17:45:48] <Roey> but you have that
[17:45:49] <Roey> hmm
[17:45:58] <Roey> why don't you do that, then?
[17:46:11] <jessedesu2> I did and it didn't work
[17:46:14] <Roey> ahhhhh
[17:46:17] <Roey> you got the same error, ok
[17:46:35] <jessedesu2> I don't get errors, it just bypasses and loads windows
[17:47:08] <jessedesu2> I don't want to delete my windows
[17:47:47] <jessedesu2> And also don't want to install grub on the windows partition cuz it might get fucked up
[17:49:47] <amigojapan> jessedesu2: did you create the boot partition as the first partition? Also did you install Linux after creating that partition?
[17:50:24] <amigojapan> jessedesu2: boot needs to be the very first partition
[17:50:24] <jessedesu2> Yes
[17:50:33] <jessedesu2> I did that
[17:50:46] <amigojapan> Hmm weird
[17:51:02] <jessedesu2> I'm at work, gonna solve it later

[18:06:55] <Roey> thanks for reminding me about the KyoAni attack
[18:07:49] <emmeka> among them was most of Dragon Maid's staff including its director, iirc
[18:08:08] <emmeka> despite that, KyoAni carried on, and Dragon Maid S was fucking excellent

[18:14:36] <Roey> that was a typo.
[18:14:47] <brainwash> bisexual means both
[18:14:54] <emmeka> brainwash I mean she's a French-speaking singer who sings primarily in English in American-style genres of music
[18:15:02] <emmeka> what did you think she was?

[18:16:01] <brainwash> I've never heard her speaking french or canadian
[18:16:09] <emmeka> "speaking Canadian"
[18:16:23] <Matt|home> Sadale : i'll try to find some place that gives it out cheaper. i think it's fucking insane that they charge you money for a flu shot in the middle of a global pandemic
[18:16:24] <emmeka> brainwash she did a bunch of albums all in French too, iirc
[18:16:27] <Matt|home> but that's fucking american for you
[18:16:30] <emmeka> they are popular enough here, at least
[18:16:34] <Matt|home> america
[18:16:37] <Sadale> Matt|home, I see :(
[18:16:43] <emmeka> though it doesn't surprise me that none of them reached American ears
[18:16:46] <darkwitch> ‰∫å means 'two' and can be read as 'ni' or 'futa'
[18:16:55] <Sadale> Matt|home, I think we do charge for flu shots here as well. Except for the eldery and the kids
[18:16:57] <Matt|home> at least the meds that i _need_ right now are cheap ish 
[18:17:21] <brainwash> > Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan, and won the musician's award for "Top Performer" as well as the gold medal for "Best Song" with "Tellement j'ai d'amour pour toi".
[18:17:27] <emmeka> Matt|home tbf, why would you need a flu shot in these times. With social distancing and masks and all that jazz, flu levels are at record lows
[18:17:45] <Matt|home> because i live in south florida where our glorious leaders think viruses are hoaxes.

[18:32:22] <emmeka> my buddy, he went to Belgium. guy's a native francophone, spoken it all his life, only learned English after I knew him. And he had to speak English the entire time he was in Belgium
[18:32:29] <emmeka> because the Belgians couldn't understand him
[18:32:55] <emmeka> he'd speak to them in normal French (for here) and they'd just give up and speak back in English
[18:33:57] <emmeka> this same guy, I'll never forget, the one time we were talking and this truck drives by which had bull horns mounted on it. And he turns to me and says "Hein check le pickup a les horns de bull"
[18:34:57] <emmeka> that's how it goes here, and basically how I myself end up talking irl. broken franglais.
