[00:02:26] <Joanna> iz: there is more to how world works than just logic. Logic is definitely a must for computing but for most people it only matters if things give desired results.
[00:02:49] <CalimeroTeknik> well, get started with meta-cognition!
[00:03:09] <CalimeroTeknik> see what processes you utilize to arrive to your conclusions
[00:03:31] <CalimeroTeknik> there is for example this very simple algorithm some people use: "if I've never seen it, it doesn't exist"
[00:03:58] <CalimeroTeknik> they are proven wrong (paradox!) each time they see something they haven't seen before
[00:05:00] <CalimeroTeknik> from here there are two ways: thinking with a more expensive but better method, or deciding that it's fine… and possibly making the gross error of assuming that "because I will be wrong every now and then, then everyone else will also be"
[00:05:14] <CalimeroTeknik> the bias of assuming that others process information the same way as you do :)
[00:06:59] <Joanna> There are a lot of illogical things on a very large scale which may very well lead to a crash. For example I find it illogical to rely upon imported fossil fuels but people in control say these things are great , no need to think of what could grow wrong. In general I’ve found that most people don’t spend much time thinking about what can go wrong they prefer to wait til something goes wrong then react.
[00:07:28] <Joanna> Sorry for typos
[00:08:09] <CalimeroTeknik> "I find it illogical to rely upon imported fossil fuels" → relying upon something is neither logical nor illogical
[00:08:29] <CalimeroTeknik> it's merely a choice, only a reasoning to it can be logical or not
[00:09:28] <Joanna> Logic is consistency?
[00:09:56] <CalimeroTeknik> logic is the application of rules
[00:10:23] <Joanna> Relying on imported fuels is a bad idea in my opinion
[00:10:33] <CalimeroTeknik> I use the minimalist axioms in logic, because they do not produce incorrect conclusions from correct premises
[00:10:57] <CalimeroTeknik> well, it's possible to logically derive that it constitutes a danger, yes
[00:11:07] <Joanna> Everything is either an idea or opinion
[00:12:26] <CalimeroTeknik> no, reasonings are not
[00:12:33] <CalimeroTeknik> ah wait, er, they're ideas, yes
[00:13:10] <CalimeroTeknik> David Hume called this 'statements of fact' and 'relations of ideas'
[00:13:30] <Joanna> Sometimes logic is misleading. The example of dog would lead someone to believe that the possibility of dog barking when it shouldn’t is as good as it barking when it should
[00:14:03] <CalimeroTeknik> how is "good" defined here?
[00:14:17] <Joanna> Opinion
[00:15:41] <Joanna> Fossil fuel technology is an idea . Widespread implementation is an opinion.
[00:16:53] <Joanna> Amish are only ones I can think of that are against this technology
[00:33:18] <CalimeroTeknik> as a population group maybe, but individuals as well

[04:40:39] <Joanna> Another thing I wanted to say about logic though is that logic is required for computer programming because computers are dumb. If you tried to communicated with another human like you do with  a computer, the human would probably get offended or bored before every sentence would be very long and unnecessarily detailed . Most communication is based upon assumptions of what is likely and possible which works fairly well most of the 
[04:40:39] <Joanna> time. We fill on the missing parts with what we think is the most likely thing to be talking about. There are all sorts of trick questions to mock people for assumptions they make but without the assumptions communication would be very difficult. Even people who don’t speak the same language can communicate with gestures and body language.

[04:46:40] <Joanna> Hi plankster
[05:09:19] <jan6> good luck trying to communicate anything other than basic needs without sharing some common language
[05:11:40] <jan6> and/or culture
[05:12:38] <Joanna> I have problems communicating with people who speak same language sometimes because of culture
[05:13:07] <jan6> you used logic in this sentence
[05:13:21] <jan6> ;P
[05:13:50] <Joanna> What does the phrase..I don’t have a birth certificate mean for instance?
[05:14:02] <jan6> words mean nothing
[05:14:10] <jan6> unless you give them a meaning
[05:14:32] <Joanna> See I have failed to communicate..
[05:14:43] <jan6> it means you don't have a document that fits the criteria to be classified as a "birth certificate"
[05:16:13] <Joanna> That is the prevalent interpretation not having a certified copy of the document.
[05:16:37] <jan6> it's the same phrase, different focus
[05:16:45] <jan6> I don't have *A* birth certificate
[05:16:52] <jan6> I don't have a *BIRTH CERTIFICATE*
[05:17:05] <Joanna> The idea of a birth certificate not existing is a very hard concept to communicate.
[05:17:24] <jan6> not really, if you can speak with them
[05:17:28] <jan6> a very uncommon one, sure
[05:18:04] <jan6> but like, immigrants often don't have one, for example, which shouldn't be hard to understand
[05:18:21] <Joanna> People just say go get a copy of something that doesn’t exist. It’s impossible to communicate the facts because of preconceived notions so facts are ignored and so is what I’m saying.
[05:18:24] <jan6> and from there, you can work over that you don't have one either, just like them
[05:18:47] <jan6> but also that's sorta the 99.9% thingy
[05:19:22] <jan6> like "just go to X address" assuming the person can move, because "everyone can move, right?"
[05:19:22] <Joanna> They don’t believe it’s possible. It’s as believable as telling them I can flap my arms and fly away
[05:19:38] <jan6> or "just open the website"
[05:20:12] <jan6> if practically everyone has something, it's usually safe to assume literally everyone does
[05:20:35] <Joanna> It didn’t used to be this way.
[05:20:40] <jan6> it sure did
[05:20:54] <Joanna> It’s a logical fallacy...
[05:20:59] <jan6> nope
[05:22:19] <Joanna> If you don’t have a birth certificate you are just lying because it’s impossible to be born without one!
[05:22:34] <jan6> but not everyone is born in the country they're living it
[05:22:35] <jan6> *in
[05:23:06] <jan6> so that argument doesn't really hold
[05:24:10] <jan6> and also some people are born outside hospitals too, although that'd probably be just as hard to get across, but still might help
[05:27:12] <jan6> but also, "Children who do not receive the certificate at the time of birth may apply for it anytime until the age of 18."
[05:28:30] <jan6> it's sorta the "why would you NOT want to have one" deal, similarly to assumption everyone has a job, a stable home address, phone and/or email, etc...
[05:29:23] <jan6> and assuming everyone goes to a store to buy stuff, in order to aquire stuff they want/need
[05:29:24] <jan6> etc
[05:32:45] <jan6> it's true for ALMOST EVERYONE that they have it, which is why it's hard to believe, like you can technically not have a stable home, you could drive around and sleep at motels and stuff (or possibly tent around wilderness, or sleep over at various friends/aquintances houses), but it'd be a lot of trouble nearly nobody wants to go through, you could not have phone or email or internet, but again,
[05:32:46] <jan6> it'd be very easy to have it, and nearly nobody wants to go through the trouble of explicitly not HAVING it (even if it's unused), etc etc
[05:33:32] <jan6> sorta like it can be hard to believe quintuplets exist in real life and not just in theory and books, because it's so rare
[05:34:40] <jan6> or that eye colors other than shades of brown and blue (and green) exist
[05:35:03] <jan6> etc etc

[05:41:05] <jan6> but also you could do some malicious compliance, and just hand them a piece of paper or such, with reasonably similar dimensions, that has "I can't provide a document that doesn't exist" on it (could probably be a post-it or something, but could be directly printed)

[06:00:02] <Joanna> Assumptions can definitely make communication difficult or easy

[19:51:04] <bot6> [03Youtube] We WILL Fix Climate Change! (16m 11s) uploaded by Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell on 2022-04-05
[19:53:00] <CalimeroTeknik> before watching, is this about creating volcanic winter or whatevs
[19:53:29] <jan6> nah
[19:55:02] <CalimeroTeknik> ah, it's this guy with the normalthink
[19:55:12] <jan6> it's basically trying to be optimistic, that we're not gonna get REAL apocalypse, but we'll still have a lot of trouble, but despite a "wasted decade" and lobbying against it, renewable tech and carbon capture and stuff is getting cheaper and better, and whatnot
[19:58:52] <CalimeroTeknik> apocalypse, like creation, is permanent
[19:59:24] <CalimeroTeknik> things are always fleeting, come in and out of existence, at very different paces at very different periods
[19:59:55] <CalimeroTeknik> in a way, the quicker pace the world moves at, makes the pace at which human lives come in and out of existence… slower
[20:03:19] <Joanna> I’m all for saving the environment but I believe the climate change promoters are the fossil fuel industry are they not?
[20:05:30] <CalimeroTeknik> I see that the video confirms my point that it's not about *fighting against* but rather making the horrible things redundant with okay ones
[20:06:43] <CalimeroTeknik> and there we go, electric cars running on lithium
[20:06:58] <CalimeroTeknik> when we could do graphene capacitors that have *three* times the capacity
[20:08:58] <Joanna> It’s all a fantasy promising people that they can keep their wasteful lifestyles.
[20:09:56] <CalimeroTeknik> the time for graphene will come, but the people making money from the human and environmental carnage that lithium and boron are, don't like it
[20:11:07] <CalimeroTeknik> graphene is crazy, and you can produce it from… carbon powder
[20:11:46] <Joanna> No talk of getting rid of fossil fuels or consumerism or wandering around naked in warm weather is there? No talk of tearing up all the pavement and planting fruit trees and vegerable gardens . All they want to do is raise taxes to make themselves richer.
[20:12:32] <Joanna> And/or snuff a large portion of the population and take over the land they are occupying.
[20:13:30] <Joanna> The people in charge are the same people who created the current mess.
[20:15:23] <Joanna> Electric cars are no replacement for fossil fuel. Electricity has to be generated so unless they are all solar and you are happy only driving on sunny days...
[20:16:58] <CalimeroTeknik> haha excellent, at 11m32s there is a total remake of https://youtu.be/HSD1d-6P6qI\
[20:17:00] <Joanna> Everything takes a lot of energy. Without fossil fuel there is no more cheap pavement or plastics or affordable stuff from far away.
[20:17:28] <CalimeroTeknik> jan6, did you notice that? (what I just said) 
[20:18:06] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: hilarious:)
[20:18:58] <Joanna> Carbon in
[20:19:24] <Joanna> Is not a pollutant to get rid
[20:19:29] <Joanna> Of
[20:19:39] <CalimeroTeknik> ?
[20:19:55] <Joanna> Sorry for typos
[20:20:19] <CalimeroTeknik> ah, "carbon is not a pollutant"
[20:20:53] <Joanna> The climate change shills claim that co2 is a problem.  Co2 is what carbohydrates are made from
[20:21:41] <CalimeroTeknik> oh you mean the CO₂ism
[20:22:05] <Joanna> Speaking of which.. what is happening in Europe? Was your gas shut off?
[20:22:06] <CalimeroTeknik> yeah, it's dogmatic and simplistic
[20:22:39] <Joanna> It’s a lie that uneducated people might believe.
[20:24:12] <Joanna> People don’t want to give up their air conditioners or cars or artificial lighting.
[20:24:42] <CalimeroTeknik> >In one embodiment, a graphene-based supercapacitor uses curved graphene sheets that do not stack face-to-face, forming mesopores that are accessible to and wettable by ionic electrolytes at voltages up to 4 V. A specific energy of 85.6 Wh/kg (308 kJ/kg) is obtained at room temperature equaling that of a conventional nickel metal hydride battery, but with 100-1000 times greater specific power.
[20:25:10] <CalimeroTeknik> [sound of lithium-ion battery manufacturers freaking out]
[20:25:35] <CalimeroTeknik> and that was a 2010 result
[20:25:37] <Joanna> You know what it’s like? One of those charlatans telling overweight people that they have a book on how to lose weight eating anything you want !
[20:26:11] <CalimeroTeknik> since then the energy has grown to 4× lithium-polymer
[20:27:37] <CalimeroTeknik> I've postponed all buying of batteries since 2010 (I accidentally bought maybe 100g of lithium batteries one way or another since), firmly waiting for graphene supercapacitors
[20:27:47] <jessicara> gas is still flowing
[20:27:58] <jessicara> and the uk exposure is less than 5%
[20:28:06] <jessicara> wheat on the other hand
[20:28:07] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: while I’m fascinated by advances in technology, technology controlled by bad people gives bad results. By all rights we already have enough technology for everyone on earth to have a home and food and a lifestyle with plenty of leisure time.
[20:28:14] <jessicara> bread is up, milk is up, eggs are up
[20:28:20] <jessicara> the staples are all up
[20:29:01] <jessicara> yeah i think early on many of us were hopeful technology would sort of democratize and open up everything
[20:29:05] <Joanna> Sounds bad. Maybe gas is coming from reserves or uk has different source
[20:29:18] <jessicara> not, concentrate a bunch of megaphones around like 2 people
[20:29:23] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, well, since we do already have graphene capacitors, yes :p
[20:29:54] <jessicara> by exposure i mean 5% of the gas is from russia
[20:29:59] <jessicara> not much at all
[20:30:05] <jessicara> and it's still flowing
[20:30:07] <jessicara> so
[20:30:14] <jessicara> prices are up with no supply shortage i guess
[20:30:28] <CalimeroTeknik> that's speculation for ya
[20:30:51] <Joanna> Technology has not improved anything really. I bet people were happier in the old days than modern isolated people are.
[20:30:58] <jessicara> oh it has improved a lot
[20:31:06] <jessicara> it's just improved for a few more than the rest
[20:31:44] <CalimeroTeknik> that joke works better in French
[20:31:53] <CalimeroTeknik> (I'm quite happy to have insulation at home)
[20:32:06] <Joanna> I stocked up on foods from Italy recently just in case and the prices had risen.
[20:32:34] <jessicara> stockpiling won't work this time
[20:33:01] <jessicara> these are persistent changes, no stockpile can last long enough to offset them by just stockpiling i think
[20:33:03] <CalimeroTeknik> it's the stockpiling that creates the shortage, too ^^
[20:33:12] <Joanna> Maybe not but I want to delay the inevitable:)
[20:33:27] <jessicara> yeah i've got a small collection to handle if are cut off for a while
[20:33:54] <CalimeroTeknik> what are you stockpiling that can't come from anywhere but Italy?
[20:34:03] * jessicara wonders that too
[20:34:35] <jessicara> when i think stockpiles, i think those tins of beans and sausages, tins of ham and pork which keep for many years
[20:35:04] <Joanna> Whole wheat Pasta sauce,  hazelnut spread. Biscotti
[20:35:24] <jessicara> well, better stockpiling things will actually be willing to eat
[20:35:28] <jessicara> otherwise, things like
[20:35:35] <Joanna> That’s a problem things expire
[20:35:36] <jessicara> will have to eat them eventually

[20:36:10] <Joanna> Cereals from Europe only are good for around six months
[20:37:17] <Joanna> The think I am worried about is if people can’t afford food farmers will destroy their crops and livestock or not grow more
[20:38:23] <Joanna> During Great Depression there were still a lot of family farms now it’s mostly corporate?
[20:41:42] <Joanna> I don’t believe that universal basic income ploy either. people in charge would rather cull the population than put us all on welfare.
[20:46:37] <jessicara> seems so after seeing what happened to universal credit in the uk

[20:47:02] <jessicara> was supposed to be a lot better than it turned out after the more standard tories got their hands on it
[20:48:36] <jessicara> it basically became a try to force disabled people in to work by repeated squeezing and refusing to pay what already agreed to
[20:51:59] <Joanna> In the best case scenario you will have barely enough money to live on and be constantly under threat of losing your income if you don’t do exactly what they say
[20:52:22] * jessicara still has questions where the money actually went, it was budgeted for but didn't end up in the hands of who was agreed to receive it
[20:52:51] <Joanna> Tossing people out on the streets to live is nothing new.
[20:53:18] <Joanna> jessicara: it was stolen by rich people most likely
[20:53:27] <jessicara> yeah i think it was stolen too
[20:54:14] <Joanna> As long as most people look the other way it will on
[20:54:23] <jessicara> much like the food for kids stuff during the pandemic, costs like 200 pounds for a banana and a slice of bread? nah
[20:54:53] <Joanna> Only get worse. Remember what was done to the Irish? Did they get any help?
[20:55:07] * jessicara also notices they gave a grapefruit to someone who could die because of their medication in combination with it
[20:55:50] <Joanna> Another good reason to avoid medicine
[20:56:10] <jessicara> if it is required it is required
[20:56:18] <jessicara> not much can do at that point to avoid it
[20:57:17] <Joanna> Weren’t the british making do not revive orders during pandemic?
[20:57:30] <jessicara> doing this before it too
[20:57:43] <jessicara> and yeah, uk healthcare has been a disaster for a long time
[20:57:51] <jessicara> pandemic only worsened it faster
[20:57:57] <Joanna> Privatized ?
[20:58:38] <jessicara> privatized, underfunded, understaffed, under-respected professions in general
[20:59:05] *** Joins: suss (~user@user/suss)
[20:59:34] <jessicara> there's even more though, the way it's organised seems to manage the life out of it
[20:59:52] <Joanna> In Romania I was told they were literally trapping people in hospitals and confiscating their phones and murdering them for the Covid death bribe
[21:00:27] <jessicara> it's entirely possible to be seeing no patients and doing paperwork all day, getting paid for providing no actual service
[21:01:13] <jessicara> that sounds off
[21:01:19] <jessicara> what bribe?
[21:01:33] <jessicara> there is no payment for deaths as far as i'm aware
[21:01:43] <Joanna> It’s easier to assume that there is no health care
[21:02:17] <Joanna> Hospitals were getting money for Covid deaths
[21:03:08] <Joanna> And killing people with ventilators in some places. They didn’t let anyone in to visit them either.
[21:04:02] <Joanna> If you provide money it’s amazing what people will do isn’t it?
