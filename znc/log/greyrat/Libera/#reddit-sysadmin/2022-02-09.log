[00:00:06] <AnonymooseReddtr> meh i get that phasey
[00:00:26] <vinrock> not counting cellphones, i am shocked to have only had one person break one thing in the 7 years ive been here
[00:00:29] <AnonymooseReddtr> but i'd just be like look, i can build you this <kick ass desktop> now and get you out of your bind for the AGM or waste my time trying to find a sub-par laptop due to supply shortages
[00:00:47] <vinrock> salesguy dropped his laptop, open face onto the corner of something and blew a hole straight thru the top case
[00:00:48] <AnonymooseReddtr> vinrock I used to work for a defense contractor.  Shit got broke in WEIRD ways
[00:00:52] <vinrock> hah
[00:01:06] <Bru^> lol
[00:01:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> had one guy that had his cell phone get caught in an airplane seat and get bent in 2? 
[00:01:21] <Bru^> yeah this laptop took a huuuuge radium blast
[00:01:36] <AnonymooseReddtr> one guy managed to find the only fucking drainage ditch in the middle of the Arizona desert that had water in it
[00:01:43] <vinrock> oh jesus
[00:01:44] <Bru^> lol
[00:02:21] <AnonymooseReddtr> lots of fun
[00:02:39] <Bru^> lets just say
[00:02:42] <Bru^> toughbooks arent that tough
[00:02:44] <vinrock> ive had my hands on a lot of used toughbooks and i wonder if they look the way they do because of the use case for the previous owner, or if they look this way because the previous owner knew it was 'indestructible' and would just toss it inthe bed of a pickup truck every day
[00:02:47] <vinrock> lol bru
[00:02:57] <Bru^> haha
[00:02:59] <Bru^> great minds
[00:03:01] <vinrock> the ones i get are the ones that are super beefy and the build is insane on them
[00:03:07] <Bru^> sales fleet used CFC1s and CFC2s
[00:03:14] <Bru^> oh the um
[00:03:15] <Bru^> shit
[00:03:17] <Bru^> forgot the model
[00:03:19] <sd> 06<P‚Äãhasey> AnonymooseReddtr I asked; they took it to the CEO and made a case for a laptop ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I can only make recommendations comes out of there pockets anyways
[00:03:19] <Bru^> the rubberized ones
[00:03:25] <Bru^> CF19s
[00:03:27] <Bru^> we had SOME of those
[00:03:31] <vinrock> yeah these things are stonk, they have rubber armor on everything
[00:03:32] <sd> 06<P‚Äãhasey> we throw money around like it's nothing
[00:03:39] <Bru^> yeah
[00:03:41] <vinrock> the hdd is enclosed in this metal housing full of foam
[00:03:41] <Bru^> those were neat
[00:03:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> toughbooks are cool
[00:03:45] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah
[00:03:50] <Bru^> overpriced AF though
[00:03:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> another old job was an oil & gas company
[00:03:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> i was buying used CF-31's for the field crews
[00:03:58] <vinrock> crazy overpriced
[00:04:04] <Bru^> support sucked
[00:04:06] <Bru^> website sucked
[00:04:11] <vinrock> we buy them used for our diesel techs and the ones we buy pre loaded with software are still like 4-5 grand
[00:04:12] <Bru^> device was okay
[00:04:19] <vinrock> the sftware is maybe half that
[00:04:21] <Bru^> iif
[00:04:22] <Bru^> oof*
[00:04:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> 4-5k? yeah i was gonna say thats probably a lot of the software 
[00:04:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> I know the used CF31's I was ordering were $2k or so
[00:04:58] <vinrock> yeah i think when i was digging in the hardware was around half the price
[00:05:05] <vinrock> but thats still crazy for a beat to shit used laptop
[00:06:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> yup
[00:06:19] <AnonymooseReddtr> considering i was paying $1k or so for a brand new latitude
[00:06:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> BUT these were going out into oil fields and mines
[00:07:27] <vinrock> yeah i try to stay right around a g for our laptops, not considering the diesel shop and my own laptop
[00:09:34] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah thats a reasonable budget
[00:09:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> I used to always budget $1k for a replacement and $1500 or so for a new hire
[00:09:54] <AnonymooseReddtr> just because the new hire usually needed additional hardware
[00:10:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> now I don't have to deal with it anymore lol

[06:21:01] <JollyRgrs> i have no problem with mine
[06:21:11] <JollyRgrs> i can tap my card or tap my phone, works fine either way
[06:21:17] <misspwn> yeah i mean if they are embracing it, that's fine seems like they are having success
[06:21:26] <xe0n> have for years
[06:21:35] <misspwn> i won't put it on my phone though
[06:21:35] <xe0n> i havent carried cards for nearly 5 years haha
[06:21:48] <xe0n> i use my watch for most payments lol
[06:21:52] <xe0n> most = all
[06:22:01] <JollyRgrs> why not on your phone?
[06:22:06] <JollyRgrs> to me phone is safer
[06:22:08] <xe0n> its in my pocket :P
[06:22:08] <misspwn> boomer reasons
[06:22:24] <JollyRgrs> google makes a virtual card number they use... so when you tap it isn't even your actual card number being given to the establishment charging you
[06:22:27] <misspwn> actually i find i spend more responsibly with not having it that readily available
[06:22:33] <JollyRgrs> ...
[06:22:36] <xe0n> oh watch is bad at bars lol
[06:22:42] <xe0n> tap drink tap drink x 20
[06:22:45] <misspwn> yeah
[06:22:51] <JollyRgrs> uh... i mean when you walk up to the register... are you NOT going to pay for everything up there if you have to pull out a wallet?
[06:23:03] <misspwn> yes
[06:23:11] <misspwn> i told you, i feel like a boomer for saying that
[06:23:17] * JollyRgrs shakes his head
[06:23:23] <misspwn> i'm at least past the only using checks...
[06:23:28] <JollyRgrs> you're not even a boomer

[06:23:55] <misspwn> my car text me and says its unlocked.
[06:23:59] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: i had to use them early on to pay bills and early landlords only took checks
[06:24:01] <misspwn> it's too much, man
[06:24:17] <JollyRgrs> just go buy a 1992 camry

[09:13:17] <JollyRgrs> but it isn't anything fancy
[09:13:33] <JollyRgrs> i was expecting a lot less for the price, but it is surprisingly pretty nice

[12:09:13] <CableNinja> I find it weird that corporate networks would allow upnp

[12:20:31] <CableNinja> honestly, I think the last 20 minutes are kinda meh. like they get the point across and such, but it feels a bit forced
[12:21:30] <Kiernian> I feel like they cut about half of that portion out for time reasons, because, yeah, you say forced, I kinda feel like it was more *rushed*
[12:21:39] <CableNinja> yeah
[12:21:48] <teh_f4ll3n> CableNinja, small offices usually have no full-time IT staff. As a result, they wouldn't normally have properly configured networks
[12:21:55] <teh_f4ll3n> at least in my exp
[12:22:15] <CableNinja> teh_f4ll3n, yeah but upnp is usually disabled by default meaning some knob had to go and turn it on
[12:22:26] <Kiernian> heh.
[12:22:44] <teh_f4ll3n> not really. the ISP box you get usually has it enabled
[12:23:08] <teh_f4ll3n> and I've seen way too many of those as the gateway device
[12:23:32] <Kiernian> "I'm going to use this bullshit home-grade hp wireless printer...whyyyyyy won't it woooooooork! It's got an aaaaaapppppp!" *stabs UPnP again anyway for good measure*
[12:24:37] <teh_f4ll3n> you'd be lucky if the network was set up by an actual IT person, and not one of the senior manager's son or something
[12:24:55] <CableNinja> fair point
[12:25:22] <teh_f4ll3n> because lil Timmy "knows his computers"
[12:25:27] <CableNinja> I mean the article does say 45k of 277k vulnerable have already been infected

[16:09:47] <Riviera> CableNinja: German's "weird word contraction complexity" at least gives you the chance of understanding new words when you know their constituents. Compare that to English and its vocabulary that you do have to learn without a chance of determining meaning of unknown words, compare how "mouth" has "oral" (different language family even) as adjective.

[17:22:03] <MOLNIJA> csws: I do not, thankfully
[17:22:06] <csws> you lied to me!
[17:22:06] <PattyCakes> Tow Trucks are a thing

[17:22:19] <teh_f4ll3n> you're right
[17:22:22] <vinrock> nobody is gonna tow the trucks
[17:22:26] <vinrock> that is career suicide
[17:22:32] <fritzwastaken> I think its funny that Gofundme has fucked themselves over the trucker thing
[17:22:32] <teh_f4ll3n> this was for the supermicro
[17:22:32] <MOLNIJA> vinrock: I'm a dragon that makes wolf noises
[17:22:34] <teh_f4ll3n> v2
[17:22:35] <PattyCakes> the government owns tow trucks
[17:22:38] <teh_f4ll3n> was for dell
[17:22:45] <vinrock> you need commerical license hlders
[17:22:53] <PattyCakes> ok?
[17:23:00] <MOLNIJA> My server has a single 2640 v3.
[17:23:06] <csws> sad
[17:23:14] <vinrock> <vinrock> nobody is gonna tow the trucks
[17:23:14] <vinrock> <vinrock> that is career suicide

[17:23:58] <MOLNIJA> it's water on ice. Impossible for the postie to deliver on

[17:24:54] <MOLNIJA> ~ open weather map
[17:24:54] <xe0n> Taylor Tomlinson is hot

[17:24:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> lots of dumbs
[17:24:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> like
[17:25:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> its fucking ridiculous
[17:25:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> protesting "free" doms
[17:25:06] <AnonymooseReddtr> so
[17:25:07] <csws> teh_f4ll3n, I hope it's total otherwise a ripoff. I paid like $90 each for 2680 v2s
[17:25:14] <MOLNIJA> also I should probably get 2660s... or just get a 269x and a HP Z440, and retire the server
[17:25:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> in a free country
[17:25:22] <cryptic1> *honk honk*
[17:25:28] <teh_f4ll3n> yeah, that was the total
[17:25:31] <cryptic1> *hooooooooonk*
[17:25:33] <sintax> nothing wrong with protesting. even if you don't agree with it. 
[17:25:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> sintax oh i agree 
[17:25:40] <PattyCakes> alright AnonymooseReddtr, I got my pickup truck and some chains
[17:25:41] <sintax> there will be no honking
[17:25:44] <PattyCakes> lets go pull some truckers out
[17:25:45] <sintax> it's banned for 10 days
[17:25:47] * csws honks
[17:25:48] <cryptic1> gonna honk big times
[17:25:51] <PattyCakes> maybe drop em off in a lake
[17:25:52] <cryptic1> *honk*
[17:25:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> I have no issues with protesting
[17:25:58] <MOLNIJA> there was a woman-looking person standing by the Mounty precinct with an upside down canoodlian flag in their hands
[17:25:59] <cryptic1> *honk honk*
[17:26:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> i have issues with them occupying a neighbourhood
[17:26:07] <sintax> public roads.
[17:26:08] <sintax> they can be there
[17:26:11] * fritzwastaken honks https://gibbyfarts.com/#nft
[17:26:16] <AnonymooseReddtr> or blocking access to EMS vehicles
[17:26:20] <AnonymooseReddtr> or stealing food from the homeless
[17:26:20] <teh_f4ll3n> !flyfact
[17:26:20] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies aren‚Äôt really fans of rushing to the hospital to give birth. Their chosen method is rather disgusting as well. House flies will lay their eggs on items such as feces, rotting carcasses, and decaying fruit. Why is this? Well, it‚Äôs mainly to provide the larvae (maggots) with something to eat when they hatch.
[17:26:29] <sintax> AnonymooseReddtr: we do that on the highways and roads here not protesting in the US haha
[17:26:33] <sintax> anyways. 
[17:26:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> hahaha
[17:26:44] <MOLNIJA> AnonymooseReddtr: That's how you get change. You clot traffic.
[17:26:48] <AnonymooseReddtr> meh
[17:26:51] <PattyCakes> sintax, I too have tried to drive in or around LA at any hour on any day
[17:26:52] <PattyCakes> :P
[17:26:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol 
[17:26:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah Toronto rush hour sucks
[17:27:00] <sintax> haha
[17:27:03] <csws> redditors having cats shitting in their beds is pretty funny tbh
[17:27:07] <csws> I hope hte honking continues
[17:27:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol csws
[17:27:11] <vinrock> la's traffic is insane and makes no sense
[17:27:11] <sintax> ha
[17:27:16] <fritzwastaken> I used to work in DC, its pretty bad there
[17:27:20] <vinrock> that town is spread out and the highways are massive
[17:27:22] <MOLNIJA> I disagree with their cause, and I know it risks endangering lives, but protest is protest.
[17:27:24] <PattyCakes> The traffic makes sense
[17:27:26] <vinrock> the infrastructure must have been designed by a retard
[17:27:29] <sintax> the crazy thing with LA too is their highways are 8 fucking lanes one way and they still get backed up
[17:27:31] <MOLNIJA> csws: Do you hate cats?
[17:27:34] <AnonymooseReddtr> MOLNIJA oh I don't disagree with you 
[17:27:37] <vinrock> sintax ikr
[17:27:37] <teh_f4ll3n> y'all need to learn how to build cities and organise proper public transport over in yankeestan
[17:27:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> BUT
[17:27:41] <vinrock> same as 85 through atl
[17:27:43] <MOLNIJA> sintax: That's because the transit sucks
[17:27:45] <CptLuxx> 8 lane highway?
[17:27:46] <vinrock> its like 8 lanes and stops dead
[17:27:47] <CptLuxx> rofl
[17:27:49] <PattyCakes> the solution to traffic is easy
[17:27:51] <PattyCakes> public transit
[17:27:57] <sintax> hell my city started a subway and quit
[17:27:58] <CptLuxx> woah woah woah PattyCakes
[17:28:01] <PattyCakes> but good luck getting a communist idea like that in the USA
[17:28:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> these morons are protesting in our capital when 90% of the "rules" and "mandates" are provincial llaw
[17:28:03] <sintax> we have subway tunnels without subway trains
[17:28:05] <CptLuxx> public transit? in the us?
[17:28:05] <MOLNIJA> PattyCakes: we have that and it still sucks
[17:28:13] <CptLuxx> what next multihome zoning?
[17:28:14] <CptLuxx> woahh
[17:28:16] <csws> MOLNIJA, I don't hate them but I don't like them either and sometimes the stray cats make me mad and I let my dog chase them
[17:28:17] <AnonymooseReddtr> sintax that would be cool to check out
[17:28:18] <PattyCakes> WOAH
[17:28:29] <vinrock> sintax ohio?
[17:28:29] <sintax> AnonymooseReddtr: they get pissy when your break in but people do it. 
[17:28:30] <PattyCakes> CptLuxx You mean I could have a pharmacy literally under my house?
[17:28:33] <PattyCakes> or a subway?
[17:28:35] <sintax> vinrock: cincinnati!
[17:28:40] <PattyCakes> the sandwich shop, not the choo choo kind
[17:28:40] <CptLuxx> or a other family
[17:28:44] <vinrock> i rememrber wtching a video of dudes exploring those tunnels
[17:28:45] <PattyCakes> OMG ANOTHER FAMILY?!
[17:28:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> they have a right to protest, but people that live there also have a right to live 
[17:28:50] <CptLuxx> YEAH INSANE
[17:28:53] <teh_f4ll3n> CptLuxx, that would be a solution to your shitty suburbia problem
[17:28:54] <CptLuxx> fuck this
[17:28:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> they want to protest every day? awesome
[17:28:58] <PattyCakes> CptLuxx, you are a communist
[17:28:58] <CptLuxx> 16 lanes highway
[17:28:58] <csws> sintax, dude the tunnel is pretty cool
[17:28:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> come back every morning
[17:29:02] <PattyCakes> you must be dealt with
[17:29:07] <csws> if only they preserved the fallout shelter
[17:29:11] * fritzwastaken looks around at 3 different conversations trying to figure out which one to join
[17:29:11] <AnonymooseReddtr> also 
[17:29:12] <MOLNIJA> AnonymooseReddtr: and that's how you exact change, you snarl traffic where people live and work
[17:29:13] <sintax> vinrock: yeah it's neat. the best is the underground beer stuff they have
[17:29:15] <csws> now it's just a mess vandalised into oblivion
[17:29:16] <CptLuxx> oh we dont ahve this issue in germany lol
[17:29:18] <vinrock> im sure its still there hidden
[17:29:27] <vinrock> they just found a hidden bunker in gibraltar
[17:29:28] <PublicWiFi> mornin everyone!
[17:29:30] <AnonymooseReddtr> MOLNIJA 90% of these people that live and work there have fuck all to do with any of these rules
[17:29:31] <fritzwastaken> mernin
[17:29:34] <sintax> vinrock: that's awesome
[17:29:35] <MOLNIJA> that's how protest works, you make things suck for people unless and until your demands are met
[17:29:36] <csws> PublicWiFi, you joined just in time for the pol
[17:29:41] <fritzwastaken> lol
[17:29:43] <sintax> haha
[17:29:44] <PublicWiFi> csws: aw shit
[17:29:44] <MOLNIJA> oh lort
[17:29:45] <teh_f4ll3n> CptLuxx, why did I think you were PublicWiFi?
[17:29:48] <CptLuxx> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Flsg_mzG-M
[17:29:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol MOLNIJA are you licking boots again
[17:30:13] <PublicWiFi> oh we're talkin about the truckers
[17:30:17] <MOLNIJA> AnonymooseReddtr: No? I think these protesters are wrong and insane, but protest is protest and it's important to know the methods
[17:30:24] <estranger> https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2022/02/07/fed-designs-digital-dollar-that-handles-17-million-transactions-per-second/?sh=1767976f1c29 this is why crypto will never be mainstream anytime soon.  1.7m/sec @ a P95 latency of 2seconds is terrible for a clearinghouse
[17:30:24] * sintax hides in his corner with his constitutional/conservative views of gov't and keeps his mouth shut
[17:30:25] <AnonymooseReddtr> if only there was a pipeline, or disputed land claim that they are occupying 
[17:30:31] <PublicWiFi> as a southern redneck you can guess my views, so ill let yall just assume and we can do something else with this topic lol
[17:30:38] <sintax> pew pew
[17:30:39] <MOLNIJA> in case you want to throw your own protest
[17:30:40] <teh_f4ll3n> CptLuxx, there's also a channel dedicated to road design and traffic on YT. Forget what it's called
[17:30:40] <sintax> ??
[17:30:49] <CptLuxx> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCOdQsZa15o
[17:30:51] <AnonymooseReddtr> meh 
[17:30:56] <CptLuxx> that channel is good teh_f4ll3n
[17:30:58] <AnonymooseReddtr> these morons have KIDS with them too
[17:31:03] <MOLNIJA> so-called constitutionalists rarely understand their country's constitutions
[17:31:07] <PattyCakes> sintax - leave me alone, I leave you alone and maybe somewhere in the middle we don't lose every single safety net
[17:31:08] <PattyCakes> ya know?
[17:31:11] <sintax> AnonymooseReddtr: yup. can't leave them at home. that'd be neglect!
[17:31:12] <PublicWiFi> estranger: yup and china has been talking about their new digital currency that has like... 16 billion yuan in exchange per year? aka nothing
[17:31:18] <teh_f4ll3n> CptLuxx, that's the one I was thinking of
[17:31:18] <PattyCakes> a hard and shocking concept
[17:31:19] <PattyCakes> I know
[17:31:27] <teh_f4ll3n> Not Just bikes
[17:31:33] <estranger> PublicWiFi it's too damn slow to reconcile
[17:31:34] <xe0n> hard and shocking - title of PattyCakes's porno
[17:31:36] <sintax> PattyCakes: exactly! I miss two ish years ago when the government did it's thing and left me alone and people left eachother alone to do their own thing. 
[17:31:36] <PublicWiFi> pol is disgusting
[17:31:42] <PublicWiFi> no one here is gonna change their mind
[17:31:46] <PublicWiFi> no one here wants to learn or change
[17:31:49] <PublicWiFi> lets just change the subject
[17:31:53] * csws starts screaming
[17:31:56] <csws> there's my pol contribution
[17:31:58] * sintax starts fapping
[17:32:01] * csws checks the topic
[17:32:02] <MOLNIJA> well, yeah, this convoy is protesting the wrong government in the wrong place. They should be marching on provincial government seats
[17:32:02] <PublicWiFi> csws: seems about the same lol
[17:32:03] <xe0n> NO POL
[17:32:03] <csws> so how about them guns eh

[17:41:36] <AnonymooseReddtr> there are some, 
[17:41:37] <csws> PublicWiFi, I actually did buy the little magnetic thingies for my modmic before they shutdown and it was pretty reasonable
[17:41:41] <PattyCakes> PattyCakes, would you like that Small, Medium or large?
[17:41:42] <csws> like 6 months before they shut

[17:42:35] <sintax> we're going to teh_f4ll3n 's house
[17:42:38] <sintax> pack it up
[17:42:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> YEARS ago with canada computers, we went in and buddy bought some memory
[17:42:51] <AnonymooseReddtr> this was in college, so 2002/2003?  
[17:42:56] <csws> after NCIX vanished I had to go to memex instead
[17:43:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> The memory was BAD, DOA.   
[17:43:07] <teh_f4ll3n> sintax, you swimming the atlantic?
[17:43:07] <csws> amazing
[17:43:19] <AnonymooseReddtr> went back to CC to return it and this vile woman behind the counter accused us of breaking it, installing it wrong etc. 
[17:43:24] <sintax> teh_f4ll3n: i can float really well!
[17:43:39] <teh_f4ll3n> shark bait
[17:43:41] <PattyCakes> $10 to float on top of sintax on our way over
[17:43:47] <sintax> ^^
[17:43:49] <AnonymooseReddtr> at the time I had already been working for a computer shop for about 5 years part time,  and we were all in Computer engineering lol
[17:43:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> so i got into an argument with her about it
[17:43:58] <estranger> data is the new gold
[17:44:03] <vinrock> i love when simps try to correct me
[17:44:10] <AnonymooseReddtr> finally got the return done and we left
[17:44:12] <cryptic1> AnonymooseReddtr, memory express is similar to canada computers but strictly PC parts no appliances etc and lots of staff.  The store is a bit of a sleeper to get parts from as its not usually very busy here
[17:44:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> it was shit ram too
[17:44:16] <vinrock> i let them speak then i articulate the science behind why they are stupid
[17:44:22] <teh_f4ll3n> $10 to get on top of sintax? damn you cheap, m8
[17:44:26] <AnonymooseReddtr> cryptic1 yeah we don't have either local
[17:44:29] <sintax> teh_f4ll3n: but i'm a good time
[17:44:30] <AnonymooseReddtr> i'd have to drive to kingston
[17:44:31] <PattyCakes> just because you're right vinrock, doesn't make you any less of a dick

[17:44:37] <vinrock> i never said im not a dick
[17:44:37] <cryptic1> AnonymooseReddtr, well that sucks :(
[17:44:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> bestbuy has the AIO cooler I want in stock though 
[17:44:41] <estranger> lol
[17:44:43] <vinrock> im a huge asshole 
[17:44:46] <PattyCakes> glad we got that understood
[17:44:46] <csws> I went to memory express like once to buy a cable
[17:44:49] <AnonymooseReddtr> and its the same price as newegg/CC/etc.
[17:44:51] <csws> and because I didn't have a car I walked up a giant hill
[17:44:55] <csws> nearly died getting there. good times
[17:45:08] <vinrock> yeah but you got swole yo
[17:45:09] <teh_f4ll3n> sintax, will probably need a few courses of antibiotics after though
[17:45:15] <sintax> ^^
[17:45:17] <csws> vinrock, I wish I could go back and tackle the hill again
[17:45:18] <cryptic1> just get it there then
[17:45:20] <sintax> knowing this group i will haha

[17:45:25] <cryptic1> who cares where you get parts if the price is good
[17:45:29] <vinrock> im gonna punish my body thi summer
[17:45:33] <vinrock> i need to get back in shape im gettin weak
[17:45:39] <PattyCakes> don't worry sintax, what I got can't be cured by a simple pill
[17:45:40] <fritzwastaken> cryptic1: thats what I said the last time I built a person
[17:45:46] <PattyCakes> and on that note, I should go find some more coffee
[17:45:51] <teh_f4ll3n> vinrock, that's what I said last summer

[17:56:41] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> They released a card that was supposed to not be good for mining
[17:56:49] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> But it was done at the driver level and thus instantly cracked
[17:57:19] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> They also made cards that were specifically FOR mining but they can't make enough to alleviate the market pressure for regular gaming cards
[17:57:28] <vinrock> from wha i was reading the crack only enabled partial performance tho
[17:57:33] <vinrock> not full throttle
[17:57:43] <xe0n> charlie's angels: full throttle

[19:29:37] <PublicWiFi> ‚ÄúPutting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future.

[22:10:25] <signofzeta> AnonymooseReddtr: Yes, my bosses use a Power BI template to analyze call metrics from our phone software.  They also have one to pull data from our ticketing platform.

[22:12:45] <DrGibby> I use a flow to make it look like I'm working from 8-9 am every day
[22:12:55] <AnonymooseReddtr> signofzeta oh you can do that from Teams too if you are using teams for your phone system
[22:12:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> :D
[22:12:58] <signofzeta> at this point, we only use Power BI to generate pretty reports, better than $SOFTWARE_A or $SaaS_B can generate on their own.  But hey, if we aren't on Power BI Free, Microsoft gets money for a product well-done (enough)
[22:13:08] <AnonymooseReddtr> or even just for meeting quality

[22:13:28] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol hxcsp
[22:13:31] <signofzeta> AnonymooseReddtr: We use Teams phones, but Teams alone can't handle our call center's routing.  We use an overlay app for that.

[22:13:32] <DrGibby> I forgot to disable it when I was on vacation and my boss was confused how I was sending spreadsheets from Mexico
