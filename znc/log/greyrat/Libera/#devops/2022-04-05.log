[00:13:04] <lantech19446> I want to start to concentrate on hardening the servers / nodes on my network I know i need to learn some but how beneficial is it to block icmp I'm told there are benefits but by the same token then i can't ping something inside the network and see if it's working which is annoying
[00:14:39] <PublicWiFi> blocking ICMP is kind of security through obscurity most of the time anyway
[00:15:34] <PublicWiFi> nmap would still -likely- show the host up in some way if it has open ports and stuff
[00:15:40] <PublicWiFi> but I could be wrong
[00:16:21] <PublicWiFi> i've never heard of a direct ICMP explot before
[00:16:35] <PublicWiFi> so i'd argue the administrative overhead of blocking it would outweigh and benefits
[00:16:49] <PublicWiFi> like you said, pinging something is handy when troubleshooting
[00:17:32] <Dus10> Yo peeps
[00:17:50] <Dus10> I think I am being punked...
[00:19:03] <Dus10> So, we have lost one of our people that was focused on cloud networking... we need to restaff his projects... there is an absolute doozey of a project... we don't have enough people on staff to take it on right now
[00:19:18] <Dus10> So, I did a tech check with a partner company today...
[00:19:35] <Dus10> I asked what tooling he would use to make the configuration changes (it is in Azure)
[00:19:52] <Dus10> he tells me that he uses Power Automate to run the Azure CLI for that sort of thing
[00:20:24] <Dus10> my question to people... would that "No" button be broken from you flipping out on it after you hear something like that, or is it just me?
[00:23:22] <lantech19446> thanks PublicWiFi you said what i was thinking, it makes me feel a bit better. I haven't always been the most security minded admin but this whole ransomware thing has changed my mind
[00:29:54] <PublicWiFi> oh did you guys get hit??
[00:32:12] <rawtaz> Dus10: i take it you dont like Power Automate xD
[00:32:31] <Dus10> Power Automate is fine
[00:32:49] <Dus10> it is just the most extensive gymnastics I can imagine for this purpose
[00:33:06] <Dus10> not the right tool...
[00:33:46] <rawtaz> okay. i dont know anything about PA so i didnt get the joke (except the No button, that was pretty funny)
[00:35:44] <Dus10> try it some time... anyone that knows how to script or program will rather shot their face than use it
[00:35:53] <Dus10> it works well as "glue" to connect systems
[00:35:55] <Dus10> that is about it

[00:46:49] *** Joins: kwilczynski (sid379192@user/kwilczynski)
[00:52:55] <Dus10> he tells me that "Power Automate has if/then so I can handle errors"
[00:53:14] <Dus10> I kept asking him "Why do you use Power Automate" in different ways
[00:53:33] <Dus10> his first reply is that "without automation, it would take forever"
[00:53:57] <Dus10> I then follow up with... "Yeah, but why Power Automate and not some other tooling?"
[00:54:09] <Dus10> He basically replies with a reworded version of the first response
[00:54:23] <Dus10> so then I just straight up ask him, "Why aren't using Terraform?"
[00:55:08] <Dus10> he then tells me that he just decided to force himself to learn Microsoft native tools
[00:55:32] <Dus10> I am still wondering... how did he arrive on using Power Automate?
[00:55:56] <Dus10> like... I might use that just to do an automated tear down and rebuild of an environment
[00:56:04] <Dus10> like... just Azure Bastion, or something
[00:56:10] <Dus10> instead of leaving it running all day
[00:56:22] <Dus10> I could make an icon on my phone to kick it off
[00:56:30] <Dus10> that is all that I would do
[01:01:06] <rawtaz> jesus christ, they have a bastion service..

[01:18:50] <lantech19446> PublicWiFi: yep got hit and took out our virtual host managed to encrypt the vhdx files for our domain controller, and website along with 2 staff computers
[01:19:05] <PublicWiFi> damn!
[01:19:08] <PublicWiFi> did you guys have backups?
[01:19:10] <lantech19446> yep
[01:19:10] <PublicWiFi> how did they get in?
[01:19:11] <rawtaz> i must say you were very lucky :)
[01:19:13] <lantech19446> offline backups at that
[01:19:16] <PublicWiFi> PHEW
[01:19:18] <PublicWiFi> love to hear it
[01:19:31] <lantech19446> I had us up and functional in less than 24hrsd
[01:19:33] <lantech19446> hrs*
[01:19:36] <PublicWiFi> nice!
[01:19:48] <lantech19446> I'm still picking up some of the pieces but we barely batted an eye
[01:20:01] <PublicWiFi> you patch the hole that let them in?
[01:20:28] <lantech19446> I believe I've identified what the hole was and I will be patching it but it's not immediately accessible
[01:20:33] <rawtaz> what was it?
[01:20:43] <PublicWiFi> might not be able to say given teh situation haha
[01:21:07] <rawtaz> bah stop being silly
[01:21:09] <lantech19446> so since it happened after we closed i'm pretty sure someone was on our wifi probably torrenting shit and the wifi even though it's vlaned uses our dns
[01:22:10] <lantech19446> I'm going to put a bind based dns server on the vlaned wifi that just forwards every request outside of the network and turn everything inside the network to SSL so that dns dhcp etc will only accept secure connections / updates
[01:24:22] <rawtaz> why would them being able to access the DNS service on your DNS server allow ransomware to happen?
[01:24:55] <lantech19446> the dns server is on the domain controller which is on the virtual host and is the only hole i can think of
[01:26:34] <rawtaz> i mean, you have a theory of which way they could potentially cross network boundaries. but theres nothing in this theory that actually suggests in which way this would be a vulnerability
[01:27:42] <rawtaz> unless ive been missing something ,if your ransomware there used the DNS service (assuming we are talking about actual DNS service listening on port 53 and you not talking about other type of access to the server) to infect, then either theres a 0day which is highly serious or i missed some vulnerability
[01:28:10] <rawtaz> so what im saying is that it doesnt seem like much of a theory unless you have something more to go on, and you should probably look further if not
[01:28:22] <lantech19446> somehow they got to the virtual host and the only thing i can figure is they were able to get things onto the domain controller via port 53 and then branch out to anything else connected with a port scanner. I lack the forensic knowledge to trace it but i know that i didn't secure things as well as they should have been
[01:28:59] <rawtaz> ok. well if its what you think then you have a 0day or a vuln i dont know about, which i doubt
[01:29:19] <rawtaz> i think they got in through other ways than that port 53, unless youre running something non-standard on it
[01:29:42] <lantech19446> to be honest all the firewalls were down on the nodes themselves and have been that way for years. I didn't make it hard for them
[01:30:40] <lantech19446> the first structural change i've made now that i'm up and running again is i've reenabled every firewall on every windows device in the domain and blocked all connections other than those i've explicitly allowed
[01:30:45] <rawtaz> youre not alone in having suboptimal environments running. the entire world is full of it :>
[01:31:42] <lantech19446> i'm sure and it's years of depression that allowed me to take the easy way out but i'm going to do better now
[01:33:24] <rawtaz> you dont have to excuse yourself in here. noone is blaming you or something like that

[01:47:28] <lantech19446> i have a spoon and it means i'm eating a concrete
[01:49:46] <lantech19446> ya know what pisses me off rawtaz that encrypting your shit doesn't make you any less vulnerable to ransomware
[01:50:21] <rawtaz> encrypt where/what?
[01:50:56] <lantech19446> like encrypting my virtual host wouldn't have done anything because they could just run their encryption on top of mine
[01:52:11] <rawtaz> yeah. encryption of stuff on a running system is pretty much just for at-rest protection of the data
[01:52:12] <lantech19446> like in my mind being able to encrypt already encrypted things doesn't make sense
[01:53:35] <lantech19446> yea I also wish that wasn't true, but I don't know how i'd make it untrue lol
[01:54:28] <rawtaz> well encryption doesnt have anything to do with the protection against ransomware really
[01:55:41] <lantech19446> i know it doesn't, I just wish it did like in my head using encryption as a defense against encryption makes sense

[19:41:01] <lantech19446> At the risk of being lazy what is mesh central used for? I've never heard of it
[19:41:16] <rawtaz> think teamviwer
[19:41:19] <rawtaz> +e
[19:41:26] <rawtaz> but self-hosted, open source and so on
[19:41:38] <rawtaz> although you CAN use their cloud hosted server side if you want.
[19:41:43] <lantech19446> O ok 
[19:41:49] <rawtaz> O ye
[19:41:58] <lantech19446> We don't use anything like that in my organization
[19:42:07] <rawtaz> what do you use to remotely manage your clients?
[19:42:17] <rawtaz> or do you have to walk to them to fiddle with stuff?
[19:42:44] <lantech19446> Good rdp Ansible 
[19:42:57] <lantech19446> Gpo 
[19:43:02] <lantech19446> Fuckin autocorrect
[19:43:45] <rawtaz> GPO is a totally different thing than remotely controlling a workstation to poke around with it, so thats not even an answer

[19:43:57] <rawtaz> but you mean you use RDP then?
[19:44:04] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[19:44:04] <rawtaz> thats what i use too now, alongside ARD for the macs
[19:44:33] <lantech19446> I include gpo and Ansible in remote management but no not the same thing as rdp
[19:45:21] <lantech19446> It doesn't make sense not to use it in a windoze domain when youre given the license for it
[19:45:32] <lantech19446> I also use ssh on all of our non windoze shit
[19:46:09] <rawtaz> hm you dont need a license to use RDP on e.g. a Windows 10 or 11 though
[19:46:48] <rawtaz> hm but i guess technically you do have a license for that too, just that its not a separate one (its in the EULA im sure)

[19:54:03] <lantech19446> One of my projects for today is going to be to generate SSL certs for the servers and disable rdp passwords same for ssh
[19:55:02] <rawtaz> do you already have your own CA in the windows domain?

[20:11:19] <alex[m]1234> <rawtaz> "do you already have your own..." <- Windows AD Domain can act as a PKI Server when you install and configure the good Server role
[20:11:46] <alex[m]1234> so it can automatically generate CA + certs + fullchain and so on for each servers
