[10:52:46] <dustsigns> Good morning. I have a question regarding the FFmpeg documentation links on the Web site (https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html): The API documentation stops at version 4.1. For the current version 4.4 (as well as 4.2 and 4.3), there are no documentation links. There is only the nightly (trunk) documentation. Where can I find the API documentation for v4.4?
[10:57:47] <JEEB> I would guesstimate that it was just not built by whomever built them before for releases; I've generally just utilized the trunk stuff, since that's the most up-to-date stuff. you can also build it from the source, but I'd just go with trunk and then comparing specifics in the headers in case of differences
[11:00:41] <dustsigns> Hi, using trunk did not work so well for me. I tried to get students to start using the API for simple exercises, but the divergence between trunk and, e.g., 4.3 last year, added a lot of difficulty because of minor changes in some functions. Many students then try to find official documentation (rather than the trunk link I give them) and use outdated stuff.
[11:03:07] <dustsigns> It would be really nice to have up-to-date API documentation at least for the current version (4.4). Where is the appropriate place to input this?
