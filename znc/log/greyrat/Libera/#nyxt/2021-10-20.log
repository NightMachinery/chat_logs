[01:38:02] <uniquepointer> hello! I have a couple of questions, first I would like to know how to boot up in dark mode by default? same with blocker mode? third is how to make my custom keybindings? I am a little bit confused by the config and finally is if its possible to change the color of the minibuffer?
[01:41:45] <waleee> uniquepointer: you create a init file (~/.config/nyxt/init.lisp) and add stuff to it, for a good example see eg the ones in https://discourse.atlas.engineer/c/nyxt/configuration-expose/
[01:46:53] <uniquepointer> whoo thank you, that helps a lot
[01:49:39] <uniquepointer> https://paste.rs/67F
[01:50:01] <uniquepointer> dark mode doesnt seem to be enabled, is that config wrong?
[01:54:08] <waleee> uniquepointer: is the other modes enabled?
[01:54:52] <uniquepointer> lemme nop
[01:54:59] <uniquepointer> lmao was gonna type lemme check
[01:55:00] <uniquepointer> but yeah no
[01:56:33] <uniquepointer> that pastebin i sent, is my whole init.lisp
[01:57:02] <waleee> uniquepointer: just to check, you have opened a url? The internal buffers (eg. the default start page and dashboard etc) is special and many modes won't apply to them
[01:57:13] <uniquepointer> oh
[01:57:16] <uniquepointer> try 2
[01:57:48] <uniquepointer> it is working, sorry :s
[01:57:54] *** Quits: dije (~dije@82-71-5-38.dsl.in-addr.zen.co.uk) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[01:58:12] <waleee> the internal buffers is scheduled for a remake in 3.0 and from then on will behave more inline with regular buffers
[01:59:26] <waleee> uniquepointer: you can change the style of the internal buffers, but I don't remember if any of the configs in that discourse category does that
[02:00:04] <uniquepointer> this one has a nice theme that i been messing with https://github.com/ericdrgn/drgn.nyxt
[02:00:54] <waleee> ah, right, that one do change the theming of the internal buffers
[02:09:45] <uniquepointer> only thing is the keybindings from that config is not working so i will look for others
[02:11:32] <waleee> uniquepointer: the ones in https://github.com/ericdrgn/drgn.nyxt/blob/main/base/keybindings.lisp ?
[02:11:39] <uniquepointer> si
[02:12:49] <waleee> You are familiar with the emacs style Alt and Ctrl abbreviations?
[02:13:00] <waleee> (M and C)
[02:13:15] <uniquepointer> ye,
[02:13:28] <uniquepointer> ok so i used a different one
[02:13:28] <uniquepointer> https://github.com/kssytsrk/.nyxt.d/blob/master/init.lisp#L45
[02:13:41] <uniquepointer> this one does work but it seems i still cant bind M-./M-,
[02:14:40] <waleee> those might be bound already
[02:14:48] <uniquepointer> as a side note, how do i restore my tabs when i reopen nyxt?
[02:14:55] <waleee> it's a bit more involved to unbind them
[02:15:03] <uniquepointer> thats ok then
[02:15:06] <waleee> there is a restore option
[02:15:25] <uniquepointer> do i put it with the other modes?
[02:15:48] <waleee> uniquepointer: if you execute describe-bindings you should get a list of currently active ones
[02:16:38] <uniquepointer> hm it seems i dont get my keybindings when i open a webpage, perhaps its because i didnt activate vi-mode in my init.lisp?
[02:17:54] <waleee> yeah, if you haven't added vi-mode to init.lisp or via the gui to auto-config.lisp you will have to manually activate it
[02:18:33] <uniquepointer> it is in my auto-config.lisp
[02:18:59] <uniquepointer> https://paste.rs/bBl
[02:22:12] <waleee> peachy. I'd try restarting nyxt
[02:23:00] <uniquepointer> oh i have been
[02:23:14] <uniquepointer> its pretty weird though, as soon as i jump into a non internal buffer my keybindings disappear
[02:23:26] <uniquepointer> like everything gets unbound
[02:24:19] <uniquepointer> nvm i fixed it, it was something else i had put :|
[02:25:13] <waleee> uniquepointer: regarding restoring a session, there's session-restore-prompt, but there should be a non-manual function
[02:26:18] <uniquepointer> do you know where i can dig for it?
[02:26:23] <waleee> ah, you had https://github.com/ericdrgn/drgn.nyxt/blob/main/init.lisp#L16 in his config, so change "never-restore" to "always-restore"
[02:27:28] <waleee> or :always-ask if you want to be prompted about restoring the previous session
[02:28:37] <uniquepointer> funnily enough i didnt have that one
[02:28:44] <uniquepointer> but yeah that works
[02:32:05] <uniquepointer> ok i think thats all i needed :D the rest seems to be answered by the help page

[03:52:31] * waleee lives in a monarchy so as head of state he'd usurp the king
[03:54:47] <waleee> kind of shit deal, the current one is close to being "pensioned" and gets away with being mostly invisible, a younger model wouldn't have that luxury

[05:22:45] <jmercouris> I think it will be one of THE most memorable things in my lifetime
[05:22:46] <uniquepointer> never
[05:22:53] <jmercouris> Like the falling of the twin towers
[05:22:56] <jmercouris> I still remember
[05:23:04] <uniquepointer> i was 2 when that happened
[05:23:07] <jmercouris> Ah

[05:23:27] <uniquepointer> ty
[05:23:30] <uniquepointer> can i have money?
[05:23:40] <jmercouris> You can have money, yes
[05:23:43] <jmercouris> It is allowed
[05:23:45] <uniquepointer> thx ur very kind
[05:23:53] <jmercouris> With regard to your question
[05:24:02] <jmercouris> You are looking for nosave buffers
[05:24:09] <jmercouris> They don’t save information
[05:24:17] <jmercouris> As the name implies

[05:24:44] <uniquepointer> no
[05:24:46] <uniquepointer> why?
[05:24:50] <uniquepointer> u a spaniard?
[05:24:54] <jmercouris> Because you say “si”
[05:25:06] <jmercouris> I am a complicated story
[05:25:09] <uniquepointer> nice
[05:25:17] <uniquepointer> so you are
[05:25:22] <uniquepointer> thats pretty cool i wanna move there
[05:25:25] <jmercouris> I could be considered American German or Greek
[05:25:30] <uniquepointer> greek
[05:25:34] <jmercouris> I am not Spanish
[05:25:35] <uniquepointer> i like ur food
[05:25:54] <jmercouris> Unfortunately I do not like Greek food
[05:25:58] <jmercouris> I grew up eating it
[05:26:08] <jmercouris> I guess I got tired of it
[05:26:10] <uniquepointer> odd that growing up eating it would make u not like it
[05:26:14] <uniquepointer> fair
[05:26:18] <jmercouris> Yeah idk
[05:26:25] <jmercouris> Way too many vegetables and olive oil
[05:26:29] <uniquepointer> lmfao
[05:26:35] <uniquepointer> thats true but it adds to it
[05:26:39] <uniquepointer> im not even big on veggies
[05:26:42] <jmercouris> Like I eat a lot of Greek food obviously, but it’s never my first choice
[05:26:47] <uniquepointer> LMAO
[05:26:51] <uniquepointer> i love that u still have to eat it
[05:26:56] <jmercouris> Such is life
[05:27:00] <jmercouris> My family is Greek
[05:27:05] <jmercouris> I also have to eat German food
[05:27:07] <uniquepointer> tell them i say hi
[05:27:09] <uniquepointer> (in greek)
[05:27:12] <jmercouris> I’ll let them know
[05:27:23] <jmercouris> We don’t have a word for “hi”
[05:27:31] <jmercouris> We have a greeting that means hi and bye
[05:27:34] <jmercouris> It’s the same word
[05:27:38] <uniquepointer> aloha?
[05:27:41] <uniquepointer> omg are you hawaiian
[05:27:41] <jmercouris> No
[05:27:42] <uniquepointer> thats so cool

[05:39:46] <jmercouris> Reading on a phone
[05:39:57] <uniquepointer> that said, i bought a game engine book by eric lengyel and i actually enjoy reading it physical
[05:40:00] <jmercouris> I can’t imagine that
[05:40:21] <uniquepointer> i guess im the younger generation and it shows, its probably what keeps me so engaged with programming in my day to day
[05:40:29] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: which languages do you program
[05:40:50] <uniquepointer> rn just C, i know C++ sorta
[05:40:55] <jmercouris> I see

[05:48:49] <jmercouris> I personally learn by compiling and then reading the ASM

[05:49:10] <uniquepointer> assembly puts me off so hard
[05:49:15] <jmercouris> I'm just joking of course
[05:49:15] <uniquepointer> thats until i discovered riscv assembly

[05:49:38] <jmercouris> the only assembly I know is LC3
[05:49:43] <jmercouris> of which I wrote a VM for
[05:49:44] <uniquepointer> no i know how that sounds but it really is simple
[05:49:47] <uniquepointer> i mean i wouldnt write in it
[05:49:52] <jmercouris> it's just a simple assembly for learning assembly
[05:49:58] <uniquepointer> ohhh thats that one book/page teaching you about VMs in c right?
[05:50:06] <jmercouris> waleee: exactly
[05:50:21] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: no, it just described to me the ASM language, and I wrote a VM in Java of all languages
[05:50:26] <jmercouris> a VM on top of a VM on top of a VM
[05:50:28] <jmercouris> ay yai yai
[05:50:31] <uniquepointer> fun
[05:50:32] <jmercouris> it was part of my undergraduate degree
[05:50:44] <uniquepointer> i wish we did cool things lik ethat here :>(
[05:50:53] <jmercouris> well, you probably also pay a lot less
[05:50:57] <uniquepointer> i do
[05:51:01] <jmercouris> my school was approximately 40,000$/year
[05:51:09] <uniquepointer> yeah i pay basically nothing
[05:51:19] <jmercouris> yes, unfortunately you get what you pay for
[05:51:22] <jmercouris> I paid very little in Germany
[05:51:26] <jmercouris> and I got very little in return
[05:51:33] <uniquepointer> its weird though, our medicine education is amazing
[05:51:37] <uniquepointer> but everything else is so bad
[05:51:43] <jmercouris> you must be from the caribbean then
[05:51:45] <uniquepointer> that sucks
[05:51:50] <uniquepointer> hahaha how you figure that one out
[05:51:50] <waleee> Cuba ... ?
[05:51:55] <uniquepointer> too far
[05:51:58] <jmercouris> my second favorite school after the US was in the Netherlands
[05:52:05] <jmercouris> I loved school there
[05:52:09] <jmercouris> it was great
[05:52:15] <waleee> ah, Jamaica then?
[05:52:15] <jmercouris> Universiteit Twente :-)
[05:52:18] <uniquepointer> thats my goal country but i know i wont be able to get in in a million years
[05:52:30] <jmercouris> I'm going to go with Jamaica based on the proficiency in english
[05:52:41] <uniquepointer> waleee: closer but still far
[05:52:44] <jmercouris> damn
[05:52:45] <uniquepointer> hahaha no
[05:52:51] <jmercouris> maybe it is something like Haiti then
[05:52:51] <uniquepointer> youre not far off though
[05:52:54] <uniquepointer> NOPe
[05:53:06] <uniquepointer> i have american family and this country teaches english a lot
[05:53:12] <jmercouris> Puerto rico?
[05:53:17] <uniquepointer> hint: america loves our position
[05:53:25] <jmercouris> hm
[05:53:26] <uniquepointer> nah, i wouldve gone to school in the us
[05:53:36] <waleee> Aruba?
[05:53:44] <jmercouris> aruba he would be allowed into NL
[05:53:50] <waleee> ah right
[05:54:01] <uniquepointer> no but youre closer
[05:54:20] <jmercouris> I don't know
[05:54:22] <uniquepointer> hint: we have a bad rep for illegal shit
[05:54:27] <jmercouris> hm
[05:54:31] <jmercouris> that is many countries in the caribbean
[05:54:35] <uniquepointer> :>)
[05:54:37] <uniquepointer> papers?
[05:54:38] <waleee> the carribean is a Geogussr nightmare
[05:54:44] <waleee> Panama?
[05:54:47] <jmercouris> wait a second
[05:54:47] <uniquepointer> yyeah
[05:54:50] <jmercouris> for banks and stuff
[05:54:52] <jmercouris> ah panama
[05:54:55] <jmercouris> damnit
[05:55:00] <jmercouris> I was going to guess some tax havens next
[05:55:13] <uniquepointer> its funny its a tax haven to americans but its horrible for us
[05:55:21] <jmercouris> panama is a tax haven?
[05:55:25] <uniquepointer> allegedly
[05:55:27] <jmercouris> I thought it was just for boat registration
[05:55:30] <uniquepointer> that too
[05:55:38] <jmercouris> I was thinking of the cayman islands as a tax haven
[05:55:47] <uniquepointer> that one is absolutely a tax haven through and through
[05:55:59] <waleee> I thougth the channel was the main source of income
[05:56:05] <uniquepointer> it is
[05:56:10] <uniquepointer> and
[05:56:13] <uniquepointer> american companies second
[05:56:15] <jmercouris> woah, there is a dominoes pizza on the cayman islands
[05:56:24] <jmercouris> waleee: do they have dominoes in sweden?
[05:56:24] <uniquepointer> there is dominoes here too!
[05:56:34] <jmercouris> how about pizza hut?
[05:56:34] <waleee> I haven't seen one
[05:56:40] <uniquepointer> pizza hut as well
[05:56:41] <waleee> Pizza hut exists
[05:56:42] <jmercouris> waleee: how about 7/11?
[05:56:52] <uniquepointer> oh not with me whoops
[05:56:52] <waleee> that one is present too
[05:57:00] <jmercouris> you know what it is so surprising
[05:57:02] <uniquepointer> 7/11 is pretty cool
[05:57:06] <jmercouris> houses in the florida keys aren't actually that expensive
[05:57:14] <jmercouris> it turns out that people typically want to live in Miami
[05:57:17] <uniquepointer> nyxt meetup
[05:57:21] <jmercouris> and the prices is in the keys are way less than you think
[05:57:26] <jmercouris> lol Nyxt meetup
[05:57:26] <waleee> jmercouris: isn't that because of the flooding risk?
[05:57:31] <jmercouris> waleee: possibly
[05:57:34] <uniquepointer> i think it is
[05:57:37] <jmercouris> many of the houses have only garages on the first floors
[05:57:47] <jmercouris> I wouldn't mind it
[05:57:52] <jmercouris> it seems so peaceful to live in the keys
[05:57:57] <jmercouris> there is literally 0 through traffic
[05:58:03] <uniquepointer> lmao
[05:58:07] <jmercouris> and you have a private beach
[05:58:23] <jmercouris> I'm sure you've heard the following uniquepointer
[05:58:27] <jmercouris> a man a plan a canal panama
[05:58:34] <jmercouris> it is a palindrome
[05:58:37] <uniquepointer> no i have never heard that LOL
[05:58:47] <jmercouris> it can read right to left and left to right
[05:58:47] <uniquepointer> thank you though now i know it
[05:59:38] <jmercouris> waleee: though you know what I think yo ucan get insurance for it
[05:59:45] <jmercouris> so I don't see whta the problem is
[05:59:49] <jmercouris> s/whta/what
[05:59:57] <jmercouris> s/yo u/you
[06:00:27] <waleee> the fees are probably exorbitant
[06:00:30] <uniquepointer> oh yeah
[06:00:50] <jmercouris> waleee: if you had to leave svenska
[06:00:53] <jmercouris> where would you go
[06:00:57] <waleee> I imagine that the keys only have to lay eyes on a hurricane to get flooded
[06:01:05] <jmercouris> sverige
[06:01:35] <jmercouris> yeah, but the other days that it isn't flooded it would be nice
[06:01:45] <waleee> hm Spain maybe, the canary islands (boring, but the weather is consistent)
[06:02:07] <waleee> and not too much mosqitos
[06:02:29] <uniquepointer> to answer your question jmercouris, I think that I want to learn Zig, but actually I dont think thats much learning since its basically C for the 21st century, only bad thing is it doesnt have ctags support...Im very much a curly language person so idk what i would like to learn i care about being able to run everything in a potato
[06:02:46] <jmercouris> waleee: a good choice
[06:02:56] <jmercouris> waleee:  would you learn the whistling language?
[06:03:00] <uniquepointer> spain is pretty cool, only thing is i hear summers get really hot
[06:03:08] <jmercouris> not in the canary islands it doesn't
[06:03:17] <waleee> jmercouris: we have a single whistling sound in Swedish
[06:03:19] <uniquepointer> oh thats cool then
[06:03:27] <jmercouris> waleee: but you have to learn a whole whistling language
[06:03:28] <waleee> for "yes"
[06:03:43] <waleee> or more like a sharp intake of breath
[06:03:44] <jmercouris> do men whistle at women in sweden?
[06:04:02] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: what is a curly language?
[06:04:07] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: one that uses { } ?
[06:04:11] <uniquepointer> si
[06:04:18] <jmercouris> basically you like algol syntax?
[06:04:23] <uniquepointer> hahaha i guess so!
[06:04:23] <waleee> jmercouris: wouldn't recommend, sure way to get a railing or slap
[06:04:33] <jmercouris> waleee: I don't recommend either
[06:04:45] <jmercouris> I was thinking about how people whistle at women
[06:04:52] <jmercouris> whether that could be percieved as them just saying the word "yes"
[06:05:04] <jmercouris> I think it's ridiculous that people catcall women
[06:05:07] <uniquepointer> i think thats a rather long whistle to say yes
[06:05:10] <jmercouris> what do they expect? the woman to turn around and be flattered?
[06:05:25] <jmercouris> the woman to be like "oh wow, now that you whistled at me, let me give you attention"
[06:05:41] <jmercouris> anyways that is a bit off topic
[06:05:41] <waleee> wolf whistling/catcalling is very different from the northern sharp-intake-yes
[06:05:48] <uniquepointer> that probably happened 1 time to 1 man
[06:05:53] <uniquepointer> and nobody saw it
[06:06:00] <jmercouris> I've been catcalled before
[06:06:02] <uniquepointer> so no one believed him
[06:06:04] <jmercouris> interestingly enough
[06:06:07] <jmercouris> even as a man
[06:06:17] <uniquepointer> damn
[06:06:20] <jmercouris> when I used to go out to clubs I would get hit on quite a bit by women
[06:06:20] <uniquepointer> braggart
[06:06:28] <jmercouris> now I am bragging ;-)
[06:06:34] <uniquepointer> you absolutely are
[06:06:35] <waleee> (showing all my preconceptions now) in SF?
[06:06:40] <jmercouris> lol, not in SF
[06:06:45] <jmercouris> I did go a little partying in SF
[06:06:49] <uniquepointer> bragging to a bunch of nerds in an irc channel :>( what a low hanging fruit
[06:06:49] <jmercouris> but mostly in Chicago
[06:06:54] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: 11!!!
[06:06:56] <jmercouris> :-D!!!
[06:07:16] <waleee> uniquepointer: neckbeard-points best points!
[06:07:31] <uniquepointer> hell yea
[06:07:48] <jmercouris> ah, indeed
[06:07:54] <uniquepointer> nothing sexier than a man who understands how the machine works, that sure is attractive in chit chat :D
[06:07:54] <jmercouris> apparently they say that with older women it picks up more
[06:08:04] <uniquepointer> catcalling?
[06:08:07] <jmercouris> no no
[06:08:12] <jmercouris> that older women will approach men more often
[06:08:16] <uniquepointer> ah yes
[06:08:17] <jmercouris> it becomes less asymmetrical or something
[06:08:18] <jmercouris> I don't konw
[06:08:22] <jmercouris> s/konw/know
[06:08:28] <jmercouris> I'm only speculating, no data to speak of
[06:08:46] <jmercouris> so maybe you'll get a confidence boost as you grow older uniquepointer
[06:08:47] <uniquepointer> i have some data
[06:09:07] <uniquepointer> i date older women, and they tend to be more direct
[06:09:14] <jmercouris> hm I see
[06:09:18] <jmercouris> well, I wouldnt know
[06:09:26] <uniquepointer> idunno why though, i assume is because they dont wanna waste their time?
[06:09:33] <jmercouris> trying to get an answer from my girlfriend about what she wants to eat takes at least 30 minutes
[06:10:00] <jmercouris> "what would you like to eat?"
[06:10:05] <jmercouris> "I don't know, what do you want to eat?"
[06:10:10] <jmercouris> "since you have no opinion, I will cook X"
[06:10:13] <jmercouris> "I don't want to eat X"
[06:10:16] <jmercouris> "Ok, then I will cook Y"
[06:10:18] <waleee> an age old classic
[06:10:21] <jmercouris> "I don't want to eat Y"
[06:10:27] <jmercouris> "OK, what would you like to eat then?"
[06:10:32] <jmercouris> "I don't know"
[06:10:35] <jmercouris> literally every time
[06:10:37] <uniquepointer> bro
[06:10:39] <jmercouris> I just stopped asking
[06:10:40] <uniquepointer> i feel youre calling me out
[06:10:41] <uniquepointer> i do that
[06:10:45] <uniquepointer> :C
[06:10:53] <jmercouris> what i typically do is just prepare a weekly plan of meals
[06:10:58] <uniquepointer> smart
[06:11:00] <jmercouris> and tell her at the start of the week, is there something you want to remove
[06:11:12] <jmercouris> and then I will just say "It is on the list, we can't let the ingredients go bad, I am making this today"
[06:11:28] <jmercouris> so she has a little choice, but not too much
[06:11:33] <jmercouris> otherwise she wont pick anything
[06:12:02] <jmercouris> an age old classic indeed... indeed
[06:12:09] <jmercouris> something something echoes throughout history
[06:12:19] <jmercouris> waleee: didn't you say you would be on a more normal sleep schedule :-D?
[06:12:25] <uniquepointer> i just dig through the freezer 8D
[06:12:41] <jmercouris> the freezer is a good one yes
[06:12:47] <jmercouris> I kind of enjoy that i'm basically on your time zone waleee
[06:12:51] <jmercouris> :-)
[06:12:57] <waleee> but I have! well until today (again)
[06:13:02] <uniquepointer> tonight its spicy curly fries
[06:13:06] <uniquepointer> what time is it for you waleee ?
[06:13:08] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: oh man that's a good reminder
[06:13:13] <jmercouris> I love curly fries
[06:13:18] <jmercouris> I was going to get falafel today, but I forgot
[06:13:22] <jmercouris> I ended up making avocado pasta instead
[06:13:26] <waleee> early morning,  about 5 AM
[06:13:36] <uniquepointer> breddy cool
[06:13:37] <waleee> I took a nap earlier
[06:13:44] <uniquepointer> happens to me too
[06:13:56] <uniquepointer> i dont sleep as late as some months ago though
[06:14:02] <uniquepointer> 3 or 4 am tops nowadays
[06:14:26] <jmercouris> I used to sleep at like 4AM regularly in university
[06:14:34] <uniquepointer> wiat you never told me, what language do you guys program in?!?
[06:14:41] <jmercouris> hm, common lisp
[06:14:46] <jmercouris> Nyxt is written in it
[06:15:09] <jmercouris> we do some C though, just for FFI shims though
[06:15:33] <uniquepointer> yeah shouldve figured that one out!
[06:15:39] <jmercouris> nah its OK
[06:15:52] <jmercouris> it's not like I expect you to recognize me or something lol
[06:16:06] <uniquepointer> bro i dont even know who you are
[06:16:07] <jmercouris> I am but a tomato
[06:16:13] <uniquepointer> you are just jamer curies to me
[06:16:17] <jmercouris> that's what I am saying
[06:16:27] <jmercouris> you know curry means food in old english
[06:16:38] <jmercouris> the meaning of curry being a spice mix was just kind of adopted from indian english
[06:16:46] <jmercouris> kind of how they say "hotel" to mean restaurant in India
[06:16:50] <uniquepointer> thats cool
[06:16:50] <uniquepointer> what
[06:16:53] <uniquepointer> didnt know that
[06:17:03] <jmercouris> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5L8bdYY9FY
[06:17:04] <jmercouris> now you know
[06:17:14] <jmercouris> I love this video of the dog eating the tomato for some reason
[06:17:20] <uniquepointer> i have seen that video a lot lmfao
[06:17:22] <jmercouris> I find it very funny
[06:17:49] <uniquepointer> i just feel happy for him
[06:17:53] <jmercouris> :-)
[06:17:56] <jmercouris> good doggy
[06:17:57] <uniquepointer> he just having a regular day eating a tomato :)
[06:18:02] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: are you a dog person?
[06:18:10] <uniquepointer> animal person in general, but i have a dog
[06:18:17] <jmercouris> dogs are fantastic
[06:18:20] <jmercouris> I love dogs
[06:18:28] <uniquepointer> for my next pet i want a cat though
[06:18:31] <uniquepointer> dogs are so energetic
[06:18:35] * jmercouris becomes OP
[06:18:37] <uniquepointer> and im low energy person
[06:18:41] <jmercouris> I see
[06:18:51] <jmercouris> they have dogs that don't have a lot of energy
[06:19:00] <jmercouris> for like old people
[06:19:17] <uniquepointer> ooo basenji is on that list it seems
[06:19:23] <jmercouris> you know a dog I never thought I would like but started liking recently was a dackel
[06:19:24] <uniquepointer> makes sense i have a family member with a basenji
[06:19:38] <uniquepointer> hotdog dog?
[06:19:45] <jmercouris> yes lol
[06:19:49] <jmercouris> the little sausages
[06:20:06] <uniquepointer> im getting one of these
[06:20:06] <uniquepointer> https://www.caninejournal.com/german-shorthaired-pointer/
[06:20:09] <uniquepointer> just because of the name
[06:20:09] <jmercouris> if I was being serious though I want a german shepard
[06:20:13] <jmercouris> or a weimarener
[06:20:27] <jmercouris> oh those are good dogs
[06:20:31] <uniquepointer> i dont think i have a preference
[06:20:38] <uniquepointer> i mean ideally low energy
[06:20:42] <jmercouris> yeah in the end I would rather not get a pure bred dog
[06:20:43] <uniquepointer> but i like adopting
[06:20:44] <jmercouris> because of genetic issues
[06:20:46] <jmercouris> I want a healthy dog
[06:20:57] <jmercouris> I would adopt a healthy mixed dog of whatever
[06:20:58] <jmercouris> I don't care
[06:21:05] <jmercouris> as long as it isn't aggressive
[06:21:15] <jmercouris> that's basically my only criteria, that the dog be friendly
[06:21:22] <jmercouris> so I can trust it around children for example
[06:22:08] <uniquepointer> well
[06:22:14] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: what is one food from your country you think we should try?
[06:22:14] <uniquepointer> my only criteria is
[06:22:18] <uniquepointer> i dont know
[06:22:22] <uniquepointer> uhm
[06:22:25] <uniquepointer> hm lt me think
[06:22:26] <jmercouris> or name 5
[06:22:30] <jmercouris> whatever, doesn't have to be just one
[06:22:41] <uniquepointer> i mean one did come right to my head but how can i even explain that one
[06:22:48] <jmercouris> speaking of panama, which is close to puerto rico
[06:22:53] <jmercouris> "vamos a marte"
[06:23:10] <jmercouris> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ga0idjz_LQ
[06:23:14] <jmercouris> this stupid song is stuck in my head
[06:23:17] <jmercouris> I really don't like schlager
[06:23:45] <uniquepointer> http://www.cocinerita.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panamanian-recipe-hojaldre-fried-bread-9.jpg

[06:24:15] <jmercouris> are those fried bread?
[06:24:18] <uniquepointer> it looks weird but omg its delicious
[06:24:23] <uniquepointer> well no
[06:24:24] <jmercouris> fried bread with sausage?
[06:24:31] <uniquepointer> its more like fried dough
[06:24:37] <uniquepointer> its weird, but its amazing
[06:24:50] <jmercouris> hm I see
[06:24:53] <jmercouris> sounds good
[06:24:55] <uniquepointer> after that id say a lot of food that we might share with jamaica
[06:24:56] <jmercouris> is the dough flavored?
[06:25:06] <jmercouris> I like the jamaican meat patties
[06:25:08] <uniquepointer> http://marcapaispanama.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sous-ToYouPTY.jpeg
[06:25:11] <jmercouris> not sure what they are called
[06:25:13] <uniquepointer> it is flavored
[06:25:17] <uniquepointer> its hojaldre flavored
[06:25:31] <jmercouris> hojaldre?
[06:25:34] <jmercouris> I'm completely lost
[06:25:37] <jmercouris> do you have a recipe I can see?
[06:25:48] <uniquepointer> that last image i sent is called sao, or sous or whatever people call it, it depends per person, but its pigs feet
[06:25:53] <uniquepointer> hojaldre is the fried dough i sent you
[06:25:53] <uniquepointer> 1 sec

[06:26:35] <uniquepointer> its translated
[06:26:44] <uniquepointer> that page is hideous!
[06:27:07] <jmercouris> oh I see
[06:27:11] <jmercouris> hm sounds very similar
[06:27:20] <jmercouris> let me read it all first
[06:27:48] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: sounds delicious
[06:27:55] <jmercouris> reminds me of the mexican cowboy pillows
[06:28:00] <jmercouris> can't remember what they are called exactly
[06:28:56] <jmercouris> I will figure it out
[06:28:57] <jmercouris> give me a sec
[06:28:58] <uniquepointer> never heard of those but knowing mexicans
[06:29:00] <uniquepointer> its probably good
[06:29:07] <jmercouris> SOPAPILLAS
[06:29:09] <jmercouris> THERE WE GO
[06:29:14] <uniquepointer> also can you make a Ctrl + Shift bindings in nyxt?
[06:29:27] <jmercouris> https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23047/real-sopapillas/
[06:29:32] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: yes
[06:29:39] <jmercouris> C-s-x for example
[06:29:42] <uniquepointer> its weird i think the bindings i make are not being saved
[06:29:46] <jmercouris> Or you could write C-X
[06:29:49] <uniquepointer> those look delicious
[06:29:57] <jmercouris> yeah sorry, we don't talk about Nyxt in this channel
[06:30:00] <jmercouris> I won't be able to help you
[06:30:18] <jmercouris> so any bindings you save get applied only to new buffers
[06:30:52] <uniquepointer> oh

[06:31:38] <jmercouris> it is called in Greek "korne"
[06:31:46] <uniquepointer> oh we make those a lot here
[06:31:49] <uniquepointer> its everywhere actually
[06:31:54] <uniquepointer> on any bakery
[06:31:55] <uniquepointer> fancy or cheap
[06:31:59] <uniquepointer> theres those
[06:32:03] <jmercouris> κορνε
[06:32:14] <uniquepointer> warhammer khorne anyone?
[06:32:31] <uniquepointer> also i restart nyxt and it doesnt get added
[06:32:37] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: show me your config file
[06:32:54] <uniquepointer> ttps://paste.rs/sRO
[06:32:58] <uniquepointer> i include this in my main config
[06:34:53] <jmercouris> I see
[06:34:55] <jmercouris> let me try
[06:35:07] <uniquepointer> that was supposed to say https whoops!
[06:35:09] <jmercouris> in-package not needed
[06:35:12] <jmercouris> it's fine I figured that out
[06:35:14] <jmercouris> one second
[06:36:15] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: you are missing a paren
[06:36:30] <uniquepointer> LMAO
[06:36:42] <jmercouris> at the end
[06:36:42] <uniquepointer> outside or inside?
[06:36:44] <uniquepointer> ok
[06:36:50] <jmercouris> wait I haven't finished testing though
[06:36:53] <jmercouris> let me try
[06:37:08] <uniquepointer> oh yeah cuz now it doesnt open haha
[06:37:28] <jmercouris> please make sure to delete everything you have when I give you the example
[06:37:31] <jmercouris> and replace it with just what I have
[06:37:33] <jmercouris> one sec
[06:37:35] <uniquepointer> okok
[06:38:44] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: http://dpaste.com/HQR7E9EF3
[06:38:58] <jmercouris> the problem is that map is not an argumen to the define-key macro
[06:39:02] <jmercouris> it was on the wrong level
[06:39:10] <jmercouris> that's OK though, mistakes happen :-)
[06:39:20] <jmercouris> that's probably what messed up your parens as well
[06:39:30] <jmercouris> if you are using emacs, which I presume you are, use lispy mode
[06:39:34] <uniquepointer> im not!
[06:39:39] <jmercouris> ah, then I don't know
[06:39:42] <uniquepointer> i use an obscure text editor
[06:39:44] <jmercouris> I'm surprised that a non-emacs uesr is interested
[06:39:46] <jmercouris> kakoune?
[06:39:49] <uniquepointer> https://your-editor.org/
[06:39:54] <uniquepointer> not kakoune, i stopped using it for this one
[06:40:06] <jmercouris> you are right, I don't know this editor
[06:40:22] <jmercouris> hm, sounds a lot like nyxt
[06:40:25] <jmercouris> based on what it says at the top
[06:40:30] <jmercouris> I can see why you would like nyxt
[06:40:40] <uniquepointer> jmercouris: i was an emacs user when i started and every once in a while i would go back to it from neovim, then i found kakoune and now im in that and probably gonna stay in yed
[06:41:10] <jmercouris> well, we will see
[06:41:14] <jmercouris> you are still quite young
[06:41:18] <uniquepointer> we will!
[06:41:43] <uniquepointer> but i quite like it, i just wanted something i could maintain myself
[06:41:43] <jmercouris> man now I really want κορνε
[06:42:10] <uniquepointer> and i dont know what weird os i will feel the need to try out so i like having my programs everywhere
[06:42:18] <jmercouris> I see
[06:42:23] <uniquepointer> who says kakoune will be maintained my whole life!?!
[06:42:26] <jmercouris> my weird OS of choice is mezzano
[06:42:36] <uniquepointer> i wrote a kakoune plugin for yed
[06:42:42] <uniquepointer> mezzano never heard of it
[06:42:44] <uniquepointer> imma google it rq
[06:42:57] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: https://github.com/froggey/Mezzano
[06:43:47] <uniquepointer> do you use it often?
[06:45:20] <jmercouris> nah
[06:45:24] <jmercouris> I've only played with it a little
[06:45:30] <jmercouris> I'm a BSD refuge on NixOS right now
[06:45:49] <uniquepointer> im on nixos too
[06:45:59] <uniquepointer> void linux -> artix -> nixos
[06:46:05] <uniquepointer> i hate systemd but boy is nixos heaven
[06:46:45] <jmercouris> I have no opinion
[06:46:51] <jmercouris> I don't know much about systems
[06:47:08] <jmercouris> I'm not very familiar with the low level stuff of operating systems and the nuances of Linux
[06:47:16] <uniquepointer> ah gotcha
[06:47:26] <jmercouris> you know
[06:47:28] <jmercouris> since you use nixos
[06:47:31] <uniquepointer> well if you havent had any problems thats good
[06:47:33] <jmercouris> and you seem to be quite competent in this domain
[06:47:39] <jmercouris> I would actually really appreciate your help
[06:47:43] <uniquepointer> sup
[06:47:51] <jmercouris> so
[06:47:54] <jmercouris> someone suggested a nix flake to me
[06:47:58] <jmercouris> I don't understand what this is
[06:48:08] <jmercouris> but they said that using this, we could compile latest master on our machines personally
[06:48:08] <uniquepointer> for what?
[06:48:14] <uniquepointer> ohh
[06:48:24] <jmercouris> I don't know how that would be possible
[06:48:31] <jmercouris> because the reason latest master does NOT exist
[06:48:37] <jmercouris> is because some dependencies are missing from nixpkgs
[06:48:42] <jmercouris> I have to ping michealraskin to add them
[06:49:01] <uniquepointer> you mean for nyxt? can i see the flake?
[06:49:06] <jmercouris> there is no flake
[06:49:13] <jmercouris> they were saying we should make one
[06:49:29] <uniquepointer> oh
[06:49:34] <uniquepointer> oh oh ohhhhh gotcha
[06:49:40] <jmercouris> I've also tried to update Nyxt itself
[06:49:42] <jmercouris> https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/131665
[06:49:44] <jmercouris> but apparently I did it all wrong
[06:52:09] <uniquepointer> well it doesnt seem like you did it wrong?
[06:52:15] <uniquepointer> all checks passed, the packages built
[06:52:51] <uniquepointer> oh but they seem to have a problem with specific versions?
[06:55:18] <jmercouris> well there is a script that generates some files
[06:55:22] <jmercouris> and I edited those files manually
[06:55:28] <jmercouris> because I couldn't quite get the script to function on my machine
[06:55:43] <jmercouris> well anyways, if you figure out how to build latest master on your machine
[06:55:46] <jmercouris> I would be glad t oknow
[06:55:53] <jmercouris> I can only run it from the shell.nix file for now
[06:56:03] <uniquepointer> can u sahre your shell?
[06:56:06] <jmercouris> yes
[06:56:18] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/build-scripts/shell.nix
[06:56:38] <jmercouris> notice it includes no lisp dependencies
[06:56:49] <jmercouris> those are all submodules of Nyxt located on the _build folder
[06:58:25] <jmercouris> well, it's not an urgent thing
[06:58:34] <jmercouris> but if you are bored, and want to run latest master
[06:58:40] <jmercouris> I would be very glad to know if you know how to do it
[06:58:50] <uniquepointer> i could mess around with it
[06:59:11] <uniquepointer> the only thing im trying to understand is the _build depedencies, if they are not in the shell
[06:59:18] <uniquepointer> well i can probably pull them me self
[06:59:42] <uniquepointer> OH
[07:00:00] <uniquepointer> so the problem with the nixpkgs pr was that you need newer stuff than available?
[07:00:20] <uniquepointer> and you just need those pkgs in _build in the environment correct?
[07:00:39] <uniquepointer> like available for nyxt
[07:01:30] <uniquepointer> if you could give me a list of the packages NOT available in nixpkgs
[07:03:33] *** Joins: guest1234 (~guest1234@50.47.115.102)
[07:03:41] <guest1234> Initially, I had a smooth experience with Nyxt. Now, however, I find that some websites, such as duckduckgo and reddit, fail to work. Others, however, such as wikipedia, 4chan and overleaf, work as usual. How do I fix this?
[07:05:25] <jmercouris> guest1234: very vague description hard to say
[07:05:31] <jmercouris> guest1234: perhaps try deleting your caches
[07:05:38] <jmercouris> delete ~/.local/share/nyxt
[07:05:47] <guest1234> I think I just figured it out, i disabled composting
[07:05:54] <jmercouris> guest1234: I see
[07:06:11] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: yes I need everything in _build
[07:09:44] <uniquepointer> so
[07:09:57] <uniquepointer> question, say we are on a regular distro
[07:10:06] <uniquepointer> could that person build nyxt more easily than we can?
[07:10:43] <uniquepointer> im having a brain blast rn
[07:11:31] <uniquepointer> hm
[07:12:22] <uniquepointer> this could be much simpler, if the current atlas-engineer repo just needs whats in the repo, a nix package could potentially only depend on that repo
[07:12:47] <uniquepointer> i would just need to know whats needed to run nyxt, is it only a binary? is there any docs?
[07:20:07] <uniquepointer> yeah reading the developer installation, and the nyxt package in nix, instead of using lisppackage.nyxt or whatever we just use fetchfromgithub, add a make phase and if my understanding is correct it should be good2go
[07:20:20] <uniquepointer> but id have to try it and work out the kinks because i bet its not as simple as i think it is
[07:20:45] <uniquepointer> but i could definetely test it, i got a nur repo so that helps me check if things work the way its expected
[07:21:50] *** Quits: guest1234 (~guest1234@50.47.115.102) (Quit: Connection closed)
[07:23:49] <jmercouris> uniquepointer: yeah, they could build it way easier
[07:24:00] <jmercouris> on another distro
[07:24:11] <jmercouris> the only thing nyxt depends on is what is in the shell.nix, and the nyxt repository itself
[07:24:26] <jmercouris> so we need webkitgtk, xclip, and some other libraries
[07:24:36] <jmercouris> but otherwise, all lisp dependencies are contained within the Nyxt repository itself
[07:41:15] <uniquepointer> yeah i think i can def get something going
[07:41:23] <uniquepointer> but if i fail u i, sry
