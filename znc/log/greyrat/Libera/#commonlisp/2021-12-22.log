[01:21:32] <utis> how come (reduce #'intersection '((a b c))) returns (a b c)?
[01:23:13] <Bike> because when you give reduce a one element list, it just returns the element.
[01:23:48] <Bike> you gave it a one element list, that element being (a b c).
[01:25:19] <yitzi> If you want other behavior then use :initial-value, but returning the set is more mathematically correct.

[01:40:24] <utis_> i didn't realize this had nothing to do with #'intersection
[01:40:41] <Bike> yeah. reduce actually won't call intersection at all in this case.
[01:43:22] <Guest74> not to mention reducing with intersection wont get you what you're probably expecting.
[01:44:39] <pjb>  ∩ s
[01:44:39] <pjb> s∈S
[01:44:51] <pjb> why not. intersection reduction is useful.

[14:35:21] <attila_lendvai> what's the semantics of the :default-initargs of defclass? i have added one for a baseclass, and when i inspect the instance of a subclass of it, i can see it in SBCL's internal slots on the class, but the slot-value on the instance is not what i have specified.
[14:36:29] <jackdaniel> initargs are passed to initialize-instance, reinitialize-instance and shared-initialize
[14:36:44] <jackdaniel> they may but don't have to be used to provide values for slots
[14:38:07] <jackdaniel> (i.e you may specify an initarg is not not associated with any slot)
[14:38:47] <attila_lendvai> oh, the slot has a :initform, probably that's why it's completely ignored. thanks jackdaniel!
[14:40:54] <jackdaniel> I think that you have an initform in the subclass that you create the instance of, and you have a default initarg in the superclass's form
[14:41:49] <jackdaniel> but then even without the initform the superclass's initarg would not take effect
[14:43:31] <attila_lendvai> Xach wrote about it: https://lisptips.com/post/11728375873/initform-and-default-initargs
[14:43:38] <jackdaniel> (because default initargs are supplemented to make-instance that is specialized on the class, not as an after method)

[14:55:39] <theothornhill> Is anyone else struggling with sly not popping the marker stack correctly when using M-. and M-,?
[14:56:16] <jackdaniel> I've noticed that slime shows an empty buffer if the slime debugger is popped from another thread, not sure if that's relevant
[14:56:25] <theothornhill> I can go to definition with M-., but won't go back with M-,. It just says 'at start of xref history'

[14:57:57] <attila_lendvai> jackdaniel, nothing really, just holding off the bitrot from the hu.dwim universe. i'm mostly working on/with crypto stuff, https://www.ethswarm.org/ and Guix (i.e. scheme! :)
[14:58:32] <jackdaniel> I gather from the name that it is a project that keeps the planet warm?  ;)
[14:59:04] * attila_lendvai is reminded of all the slime gems getting bitrotten in his fork. should have submitted them again to the new maintainers...
[15:00:01] <attila_lendvai> jackdaniel, hopefully helps recovering from the ongoing mass psychosis by providing an uncensorable p2p storage infrastructure
[15:00:04] <jackdaniel> I need to give another shot guix (but plug in there non-guix repository), I really like the idea
[15:01:26] <attila_lendvai> jackdaniel, it's a whole lot of fun! i've spent a few months on nixos, but their infrastructure for services was a pain to work with. then i moved on to guix, and i didn't regret it one bit. i've already implemented the swarm service for it.
[15:02:29] <attila_lendvai> jackdaniel, the scheme devenv for guix is nowhere near the slime/sbcl experience, but it's still a lisp nevertheless. on Guix even the init process is a scheme code (i.e. instead of systemd and whatnot).

[16:34:13] <pjb> unixlisp: ^
[16:34:52] <pjb> unixlisp: nsublis as its name indicates, can mutate the old list. It returns a new list, but this new list is not a fresh list, it's a list that can be built from the conses of the old list.
[16:35:02] <pjb> (list or tree).
[16:35:32] <beach> I believe nsublis is not required to modify the existing tree.
[16:35:47] <beach> "nsublis is permitted to modify tree..."
[16:35:53] <pjb> Yes, I said "can", not "must".

[16:37:10] <pjb> That's true of about all the mutating functions. Very few are specified to exactly mutate. nconc is specified to mutate (using rplacd).  nsubstitute is not.

[16:37:40] <pjb> (incf beach)
[16:38:42] <beach> pjb: Your first answers suggested that the EQ always returns T, hence my remark.
[16:39:04] <unixlisp> pjb: yes. nsubst is also not certain to modify list.
[16:39:39] <beach> unixlisp: So why did you ask if you already knew?
[16:39:43] <pjb> Yes, I assumed that unixlisp was surprised to get T on his system, and expected NIL.
[16:39:55] <beach> I see.
[16:40:11] <unixlisp> pjb: but nstring-upcase?
[16:40:13] <pjb> So indeed, a better answer is that the value is not specified. It can be true or nil.
[16:40:23] <jackdaniel> I was about to answer: probably a generalized boolean :)
[16:41:20] <pjb> For nstring-upcase, the wording suggest that they must mutate the string.
[16:41:30] <pjb> jackdaniel: which is why I wrote true, not T ;-)
[16:41:52] <jackdaniel> generalized boolean may be the opposite of true too!
[16:42:15] <pjb> Notably: (let ((s (copy-seq "Hello World!"))) (nstring-upcase s :start 5 :end 11) s) #| --> "Hello WORLD!" |#

[17:01:49] <_death> I didn't contradict you ;)
[17:02:43] <_death> but I may disagree with precisely the word "mainly" there.. I think it's mainly for users
[17:04:23] <beach> Of course.
[17:09:25] <pjb> unixlisp: yes, and none of the cdr of the toplevel list can be mutated.  So it's in the forced-mutating functions class.
