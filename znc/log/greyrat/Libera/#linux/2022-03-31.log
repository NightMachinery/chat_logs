[00:12:53] <traptrip> hi. I have set up a working chroot with several mount binds that allow access to some outside files. when I update some of these files to test the propagation, the changes are reflected inside the chroot. except for /etc/resolv.conf! when I change this outside of the chroot, the file doesn't update inside the chroot. I'm pretty much stuck at this point. any insights would be greatly appreciated!

[08:18:33] <pnbeast> bullgard4_, tab hoarding is when you're afraid of wearing out the tab key on your keyboard so that you stop using it.  This means typing out many long, complex paths, or even longer command names, etc.  This is false economy, because it wears out your other keys.

[16:56:54] <tullnull> can't seem to find a straight answer online
[16:56:59] <sorta> the standard way of ending a process is usually a pkill

[16:57:29] <Nei> jbd2 is a kernel thread that updates the filesystem journal so it will be hard to kill...

[19:44:40] <dTal> yes, RAM is the bottleneck these days, which is why it's completely false that "you should always be running out of CPU first"
[19:44:41] <phogg> numbers pulled from a hat, not necessarily realistic, but the general idea is sound
[19:44:47] <Thuryn> for a single device, yes.  for a virtualization host, no.
[19:45:04] <phogg> dTal: you should run out of CPU first because you can easily buy enough RAM to make that the case

[19:47:58] <dTal> again, your logic relies entirely on the relative value of *adding more* RAM vs CPU, and fails to account *where we are now*, which is that RAM is a much more important bottleneck than CPU usually

Does the usual workflow with docker consist of having the source code outside of the container, and the container would only provide the services (such as the db server, nodejs etc...). Because it seems like the containers are volatile. So I can consider docker a solution that provides me with a local

[23:54:12] <TinyTimmyTokyo> i'm a gentoo user but i used fedora for a couple of years in the recent past and had no issues with it
[23:54:13] <ananke> msiism: very much so. upgrade to ssd is the best bang for the buck
[23:54:33] *** Joins: V|A (~hummus@user/VIA)
[23:54:46] <ananke> TinyTimmyTokyo: so go with fedora, if it works.
[23:54:47] <jim> so you didn't use debian derivs much?
[23:54:51] <msiism> ananke: If you don't care about having some reasonable control of your operating system, sure.

[23:55:13] <TinyTimmyTokyo> jim i used ubuntu from about 2010 to 2016
[23:55:21] <ananke> msiism: that's irrelevant. did you miss my 'regardless of the OS'?
[23:55:31] <jim> oh ok
[23:55:37] <TinyTimmyTokyo> then ubuntu stopped playing at all nice with my then desktop's wifi dongle so i switched to fedora
[23:55:50] <msiism> ananke: I think I didn't. Let me check.

[23:56:13] <TinyTimmyTokyo> after a very brief stint with debian where i could make the adapter work but its reliability was abysmal
[23:56:15] *** Joins: lle (~lle@gateway/tor-sasl/lle)
[23:56:48] <jim> so the dongle didn't change, but ubuntu did?
[23:56:51] <TinyTimmyTokyo> on fedora it worked basically flawlessly so there i stayed until an IRC friend convinced me to try gentoo
[23:57:04] <SaltHilStroller_> Tangentially related, but anyone have advice on uploading Doxygen generated docs to Confluence?
[23:57:10] <SaltHilStroller_> I saw the recommendation to use the HTML macro, but that only allows for a single page. Ideally I'd upload the output html/ folder and just have it display as a page in Confluence
[23:57:18] <TinyTimmyTokyo> jim around the 16.04 LTS its compatibility became much worse

[23:57:43] <akik> TinyTimmyTokyo: so you went from an easy distro into the hardest distro for reasons
[23:58:00] <TinyTimmyTokyo> for fun, yes
[23:58:07] <TinyTimmyTokyo> stayed cause i liked it
[23:58:35] <suid_dumpable> TinyTimmyTokyo: which chipset does the wifi dongle have? and which one is built into the notebook?
[23:58:38] *** Quits: aclark (~aclark@pool-108-51-184-139.washdc.fios.verizon.net) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:59:02] <TinyTimmyTokyo> suid_dumpable: it's not a dongle, it's a built-in adapter
[23:59:09] <TinyTimmyTokyo> and IIRC it's a RealTek chipset
[23:59:24] <suid_dumpable> TinyTimmyTokyo: realtek. that explains all.
[23:59:27] <jim> so, your choice... we could try booting a debian live (or even just a netinstall, much smaller) and see if it sees the wifi
