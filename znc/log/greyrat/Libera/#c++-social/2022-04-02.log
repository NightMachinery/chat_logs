[14:17:15] <TheFlash> Winter is back
[14:18:12] <TheFlash> Monday: +21°C. Saturday: -1°C and snow/sleet everywhere
[14:18:50] <TheFlash> Just like back home in typical June.
[14:21:47] <Carbonflux> where do you live TheFlash?
[14:22:00] <Carbonflux> Finland?
[14:22:16] <TheFlash> Germany
[14:22:36] <TheFlash> "Back home" part means Finland though.
[14:22:46] <Carbonflux> ah, well maybe its just a dip in the cycle, you should be well into spring soon.
[14:23:25] <Carbonflux> thats odd, Germany is very close to here in terms of climate normally.
[14:23:57] <Carbonflux> i live in the pacific northwest of the usa.
[14:24:22] <TheFlash> April is generally super unpredictable here.
[14:24:23] <Carbonflux> we did get some odd late snow this year.
[14:24:29] <Carbonflux> hm
[14:25:02] <T`aZ> it's the last cold days of the seasons, a bit late indeed, not that unusual
[14:25:37] <T`aZ> temp fluctuation is usually high here, all year round
[14:25:57] <T`aZ> and i have the feeling it's only going to increase in the next years
[14:26:16] <TheFlash> Where's 'here' for you?
[14:26:28] <T`aZ> i dont remeber going from 5 to 15 , to 5 , to 3, to 20 , in a week, when i was a kid
[14:26:48] <T`aZ> ha, im in belgium, so close to germany, but more rain
[14:27:02] <TheFlash> ok
[14:27:43] <T`aZ> this year the 1st of january, it was 15°
[14:28:11] <T`aZ> people at the bars outside, the terasses were full
[14:28:12] <TheFlash> That is extreme
[14:28:18] <Carbonflux> i have noticed that if you go back in 100 year increments you can find example of all the fluctuations. 
[14:28:24] <T`aZ> (corona shit rules were still in effect)
[14:28:33] <T`aZ> 1week before it was snowing
[14:29:16] <T`aZ> (or2 i dont remeber)
[14:34:56] <TheFlash> I don't know how it exactly were here during that time. I took mid December to mid January off and spent it in Finalnd. But I think if it was +15 some co-coworkers would have told me.
[14:37:48] <Carbonflux> it is kinda hard to map climate change with direct experience locally and of course there is the issue with complex systems adaptation which really muddies the water because you can't expect a linear response to inputs.
[14:41:32] <TheFlash> Well, you can map changes in local climate. But that does not tell much of the changes in global climate.
[14:45:24] <MaNI> if only the average joe knew that
[14:46:26] <Carbonflux> i have lived in the same place for 25 years and its hard for me to see any effects from climate change yet, all the weather states recently have precedent in my memory.
[14:47:40] <Carbonflux> the argument for more oscillations is something i think about.
[14:49:01] <MaNI> it doesn't help that most people have the memory of a goldfish, so when out predictable 7 year drought cycle hits all the policians are like "omg we had no way of planning for this climate change!" and when we are flooding a few years later all the brain dead idiots on the other side are all like "see its colder and more rain than ever climate change is fake"
[14:49:02] <MaNI> meh
[14:53:50] <T`aZ> who the fuck is saying climate change is fake
[14:54:58] <T`aZ> here anyway, even if we have huge fluctuation in temp, there is still a global trend to have less and less snow every year
[14:58:40] <Renderwww> and people say it like that's a bad thing!
[15:00:29] <Carbonflux> it will change a lot stuff, i read a prediction that Canada will become very wealthy because of climate change.

[15:02:19] <Carbonflux> also the northern passage could replace the Panama cannel for much of the worlds ship traffic.
[15:03:45] <MaNI> T`aZ, people who are influenced by american right wing media mostly I think, which is frustratingly common around these parts
[15:05:31] <Carbonflux> well, to be fair we don't really have a good conceptual tool set for dealing with complex systems, so the main stream scientific community tends to argue from authority which opens them up to people who will use those flaws to validate their own models.
[15:06:33] <Faux> That's vaguely consistent with other Carbonflux arguments, this markov chain is pretty getting good.

[15:07:02] <MaNI> I wish the people I'm talking about thought about things in depth enough that they worried about things like whether scientists are arguing from authority too much and so on

[15:07:28] <Faux> Don't have time, mate.
[15:07:34] <MaNI> but alas in reality I fear its a lot more like "american man on fox news say its fake and its my duty to have a bigger car so I must do it"
[15:07:50] <MaNI> or something along those lines
[15:08:18] <Carbonflux> the fact that you can't make accurate predictions with regard to complex systems at a level of granularity that we are used to tends to create openings. We really do need more time to formulate tools for understanding complex systems. 
[15:09:38] <MaNI> these are mostly the same people who actually believe that russian invasion is warranted because "USA also bad" or whatever
[15:10:27] <MaNI> which is the logic equivalent of seeing a rape on the street and instead of calling the cops thinking "oh well maybe I should go rape someone as well now"
[15:10:52] <Carbonflux> i think some of those right wing media people are more cynical than that, they just try to find ways to piss people off, meta-trolling.

[15:11:51] <MaNI> that may very well be how or why the media people themselves act as they do, but the people who parrot them OTOH, they mostly believe it I think
[15:13:06] <Faux> I did like https://i.imgur.com/kxRYwLh.jpg ; don't think it's a particularily american problem but I feel it's probably a strong contributor to the problems with our western political systems.
[15:14:07] <Faux> One of my bosses is married to a famous author who does TV adaptations for Prime; do they have a household income over $1M (presumably per year?)? I doubt it. Who are these people thinking of.

[15:16:45] <Carbonflux> i think that America is a reflection of Europe and that is why people get so mad about it. There really is nothing in American culture that does not find its roots in Europe and the UK
[15:17:10] <Carbonflux> after all, is the common Englishman really better informed than the common American?
[15:17:36] <Faux> We are better informed about our neighbours because they are an hour's drive away; we don't have such extreme regionalisation.
[15:17:43] <Faux> Also we have fewer people to learn aboutt.
