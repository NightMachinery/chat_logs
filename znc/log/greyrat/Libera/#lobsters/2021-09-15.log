[00:24:14] <iDrougge> Sure, I wouldn't be able to connect from my Amiga, but I can't connect to Discord either, and that's what happens when you're stuck in the "IRC is good enough" mindset.
[00:27:31] <bkero> IRCv3 has moved off IRC
[00:27:45] <bkero> and if history is any indication, IRC and IRCv3 will outlast all modern chat platforms.

[00:54:16] <dax> as the replies say, the spec does not enforce non-backwards-compatible behavior if clients send non-UTF8 content, because it does not enforce anything at all in that scenario

[00:59:44] <gioele> Truth be told, most of the things in that HTML5 accelerator card are feasible and would be useful. A FPGA/ASIC core for to decode Unicode codepoints into grapheme would be useful (= fast emoji decoding, not rendering). Same with the JSON deserializer. Flexbox and Grid could benefit a lot if a wide eqmatrix core were available. Same for SVG transparency rasterizers (these do/did exists in printers and

[06:43:00] <JordiGH> I'll say "grep the page for..." but I don't expect you to use grep(1). I expect you to just find it in the page somehow.

[18:28:52] <cb> gwozniak: it's unfortunate you know that
[18:29:07] <gwozniak> It's the easiest way to debug the processes that gcc starts
[18:29:32] <cb> yeah but my point stands
[18:29:39] <cb> as soon as you have to use gdb on gcc
[18:29:41] <cb> you're in hell
[18:29:55] <cb> but you're in good coompany
[18:30:04] <gwozniak> The driver runs a lot of programs: cc1 or cc1plus, as, ld, and maybe others.  Using -v can get you the options, but there are also environment variables you have to set up
[18:30:21] <cb> for i have seen the black void of gdb too
[18:30:27] <gwozniak> I learned that tip early :)

[21:42:51] <ngoldbaum> sphinx api docs are fine but take care to keep organized and useful
[21:43:12] <ngoldbaum> if that’s what you mean by auto-generated documentation
[21:43:40] <creature> By "autogenerated", I mean something like "Humans still write them, probably by annotating the source code. But CI regenerates and publishes them whenever something gets merged to production."
[21:44:05] <creature> As a comparison point to a wiki, which requires much more manual grooming.
[21:44:09] <JordiGH> I wonder how long until someone thinks that pointing a convolutional neural network at source code will produce good docs.
[21:44:15] <technomancy> good documentation doesn't come from source code
[21:44:21] <JordiGH> Won't stop them
[21:44:27] <creature> (And even if a human *doesn't* write new docs, then you can at least see new methods etc. being added, as soon as they're added.)
[21:44:56] <technomancy> calling a list of methods "documentation" is misleading IMO
[21:45:07] <ngoldbaum> it’s a kind of documentation
[21:45:11] <JordiGH> I tend to agree with technomancy that "technical writer" is still a profession with good job security.
[21:45:12] <technomancy> at best it's "technically correct" but borderline useless
[21:45:17] <ngoldbaum> it shouldn’t constitute all of the documentation
[21:46:02] <technomancy> frequently people point an automated tool at a codebase and say "there now it's documented" and that sucks; better to have nothing at all and just read the code
[21:46:04] <ngoldbaum> JordiGH: who has internal codebases that change slowly enough for a technical writer to usefully contribute documentation?
[21:46:15] <technomancy> at least then you can't pretend you're doing a good job
[21:46:28] <ngoldbaum> that doesn’t mean api docs are useless
[21:46:31] <ngoldbaum> far from it
[21:46:46] <JordiGH> ngoldbaum: Mine would.
[21:46:49] <ngoldbaum> but i agree a lot of api docs are useless because they take care to be useful
[21:46:53] <JordiGH> I would kill for a technical writer.
[21:46:55] <creature> In this particular case, the problem I'm trying to solve is "Reading the code is hard; having a more navigable way to find out what exists, and how to use it as a programmer, would be useful."
[21:47:13] <technomancy> creature: a web browser is the wrong tool for that
[21:47:32] <technomancy> your editor should turn every function call into a hyperlink; if it doesn't you may need a better editor

[21:49:22] <creature> technomancy: I think there's two problems with that approach. First up, everyone has a good editor but we still struggle with people navigating the codebase. Secondly, jumping to definition doesn't help with the larger issue. Finding a required definition, and how it's used.
[21:50:18] <technomancy> if people have trouble navigating the codebase with a good editor what makes you think they'll be able to do it with a web browser?
[21:50:25] <creature> eg. We have a bunch of pre-built components, so it's really easy to add a loading view, or a tab bar, or a multi-select dropdown. We still have some legacy code that implements those "the hard way". How does someone find out that the loading view exists? Jumping to definition works great, if they get lucky and crib from existing code that uses it.
[21:50:35] <arnt> and ever so often reinvented by people who haven't looked at old tools OR read knuth's book on the subject.
[21:50:52] <arnt> poorly reinvented IMNSHO.
[21:51:07] <creature> But I think it would be beneficial to look at a list of components, and see a loading view is listed, and click through to some human prose that has a few examples of how to use it.
[21:51:58] <technomancy> well, you do you, but if I were in that situation I would invest my documentation efforts in actually writing documentation

I'm... not thrilled to see later tools that suffer from HN syndrome: "I've considered this for ten seconds and here's my expert opinion on the matter."
[22:14:25] <creature> I would be interested to read the write-up! Particularly if you think it would be applicable to a sprawling JavaScript code base.

[22:18:11] <drobilla> If I've learned anything about documentation, it's that the kind generated from source code comments is the least important bit, by a wide margin.  It's only really useful when you already know more or less what you're looking for and need some details.
[22:18:31] <drobilla> It certainly doesn't hurt, but I've come to think of it more as step 0 that only really exists so the high-level documentation has something to link to
[22:18:31] <manicennui> Best not to write any documentation to avoid writing bad documentation.
[22:18:51] <manicennui> drobilla: Somehow it is super useful in the Ruby ecosystem though.
[22:19:19] <manicennui> The rubydoc for the common classes is super useful and I refer to it often.
[22:20:01] <creature> I like the Ruby docs too. I've been working on some Elixir for fun, and I have come to like the docs for that (hexdocs.pm).
[22:20:05] <drobilla> manicennui: Sure.  I get my point is not that it isn't useful, but if that's all you have - even if it's the most shiny perfect generated reference documentation handed down by God himself - you don't have good documentation
[22:20:23] <drobilla> That said, sure, it depends on the context
[22:20:52] <creature> The information architecture is a bit awkward - it's often quite a few clicks to get to a list of methods to scroll through, and doesn't feel very browsable - but I *do* like in Hexdocs how it's a mix of API and guides in one place. "Here's a high level overview, and you can jump to the module/method docs easily too."
[22:20:54] <manicennui> I find the combination of the rubydoc for class documentation and the Rails Guides to be top notch.
