[20:15:44] <Selvvir> carlino3, Don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help. Just ask your question or state your problem and wait. Oh, and be sure to read the channel topic.
[20:21:26] <carlino3> any idea to solve this problem? last segment should cover first segment, but if i set up a greater z-index to last one then it is covered by the previous segment
[20:21:28] <carlino3> https://jsfiddle.net/op29Lqbk/
[20:24:10] <hmw[at]> checking
[20:25:42] <hmw[at]> carlino3: I'd use a different approach, that doesn't require z-order at all
[20:25:59] <carlino3> what's your idea?
[20:26:07] <hmw[at]> hmm
[20:26:56] <hmw[at]> carlino3: Making little trapezoids that fit perfectly, so the overlap doesn't do anyhting bad
[20:27:23] <hmw[at]> or use a common green background and only draw lines with the rotated shapes on top of it
[20:27:25] <carlino3> i thought that everything in CSS was boxes
[20:27:38] <carlino3> how would you do a trapezoid?
[20:27:44] <carlino3> or you mean using vectors?
[20:27:52] <hmw[at]> carlino3: There is transforms and whatnot. I'll try a trapezoid, one moment
[20:28:04] <carlino3> ahh could work
[20:29:21] <hmw[at]> maybe with perspective. Not sure yet
[20:30:14] <hmw[at]> carlino3: https://jsfiddle.net/s5h0ta2g/
[20:31:30] <hmw[at]> carlino3: I think you don't need to place text or other elements inside those green trapezoid areas, right? Another aproach maybe just a green disk with a white disk in the middle, and use the rotated parts to only draw the radial lines. The rotated parts would have transparent or no background.
[20:31:44] <hmw[at]> and only one side would have to need a border
[20:31:47] <hmw[at]> border-left:...
[20:35:03] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[20:38:14] <hmw[at]> carlino3: Maybe you can turn this into your wheel: https://jsfiddle.net/s5h0ta2g/1/
[20:38:33] <hmw[at]> carlino3: You need to take border width into account for positioning with my example
[20:39:02] <carlino3> not in the green area, text only in the '.segment.bottom' elements
[20:39:31] <hmw[at]> right, you want the numbers there of course
[20:39:49] <hmw[at]> it can be done, might be tricky. You have 2 suggestions now, you think that may be enough? carlino3
[20:40:36] <carlino3> yes, thanks
[20:40:48] <carlino3> i don't understand what do you mean by the last fiddle
[20:40:50] <carlino3> you mean just drawing the lines?
[20:40:50] <hmw[at]> btw. I heard "Roulette" a few days ago and feel tempted to do this myself :)
[20:40:56] <hmw[at]> carlino3: yes
[20:41:40] <hmw[at]> you give the inner div only ONE border of the four sides, thus just placing the line only. Maybe using left + right border may make things easier to center though. Just make the border half as wide then.

[20:43:22] <carlino3> yes it is a good idea
[20:44:01] <carlino3> trhe problem is that i cannot use % for width if i use that approach
[20:44:20] <carlino3> and it is all intended to be resizable
[20:44:23] <hmw[at]> If your disc is at a set size, use half the px value
[20:44:59] <hmw[at]> position:relative; on the main parent possible? Then set it to position:relative (actually, anything but "static") to make 100% the size of that parent for all children.

[20:45:05] <carlino3> :)
[20:45:25] <hmw[at]> heh you did it :) Cool
[20:45:38] <carlino3> but hardcoding the bottom element sizes
[20:45:56] <carlino3> https://jsfiddle.net/4gp8zryq/9/
[20:46:10] <carlino3> it doesn't scales without using relative width and heights for the .segment.bottom
[20:48:45] <hmw[at]> hmm
[20:49:58] <carlino3> also is this a good idea or common practice? or is it better to use <svg> or a canvas for this kind of complex things
[20:50:56] <hmw[at]> carlino3: It is fairly common to "draw" with CSS, as long as the thing doesn't get too complex. With complex things, you'll run into performance problems eventually, where SVG may be better.
[20:51:40] <hmw[at]> People wouldn't use SVG for a simple speech bubble, for example. That's perfectly fine for CSS "drawing"
[20:52:09] <carlino3> well i don't think this is too complex
[20:52:49] <hmw[at]> It should be fine. I did more complex things in CSS only before.

[20:55:00] <mannequin> that's my site and i'd like to make my footer dynamic: http://localhost:8080/2021/11/15/abstract25.html
[20:55:09] <mannequin> oops
[20:55:13] <hmw[at]> heheh

[20:55:19] <mannequin> this is the site
[20:55:33] <hmw[at]> what do you mean with "dynamic"?
[20:55:48] <mannequin> sso i want it on small screens (like phones) be aligned vertically

[20:56:56] <mannequin> at this monet the footer basically does not change at all on small screens which stretches the page size for no valid reason
[20:57:46] <hmw[at]> Maybe I am not yet awake enough (first coffee still being installed). I am not certain what you mean
[20:58:11] <hmw[at]> I see, that it stretches to the window width
[20:58:22] <mannequin> i mean i want the footer elements be placed one after another vertically, not horizontally, on small screens
[20:58:30] <hmw[at]> ah
[20:59:22] <mannequin> not sure how to achieve that
[20:59:36] <hmw[at]> mannequin: This is a generic answer; I'd make the footer dependent on <body>'s width, same for the content
[21:00:00] <mannequin> how would i do that?
[21:00:02] <hmw[at]> so the only thing that needs change would be <body> itself, and the footer can't get any wider. Then you can set a max-width
[21:00:30] <hmw[at]> That's be done by making a pretty normal page, but only limit size of body instead of the content area as you seem to have done

[21:01:31] <hmw[at]> mannequin: another thing you could use is @media to check for small screens and use it to change the layout accordingly

[21:03:35] <mannequin> i'm confused, no idea how to do that
[21:03:37] <hmw[at]> mannequin: Your page is already pretty much doing that, except that your footer has a wider minimal width than the image
[21:03:51] <mannequin> ah
[21:04:06] <hmw[at]> I think using @media would be a good idea
[21:05:13] <hmw[at]> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries
[21:06:23] <hmw[at]> Using @media (width <= SOME_SIZE_HERE) { ... } and use it to override your previous rules for the footer for smaller window sizes
[21:07:20] <hmw[at]> mannequin: Overriding CSS rules is done by giving the overruling one a higher https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity
