[02:43:04] <AmR> I want know why Microsoft alias  the most of data types in WinAPI ?
[02:44:35] <Alipha> presumably the reason was that so they can change the underlying type if needed... except that that breaks ABI, which they won't do, so it's rather pointless
[02:45:54] <Friithian> ms does something pointless? Surprise at 11
[02:51:40] <Alipha> though now i'm trying to remember if they actually made good use of the typedefs, particularly around the 32-bit to 64-bit transition. was it that it used to be `typedef long DWORD;` and now it's `typedef int DWORD;` for instance? (ie, int used to be 32 bit and now it's 64 bit.)
[02:53:07] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)

[18:11:35] <CarloWood> I have a function called `on_wheel_event(offset)`.  It is called with the amount that the mouse wheel did spin during the last frame.
[18:12:07] <cbreak> frame?
[18:12:49] <CarloWood> Now, if I spin my wheel up (the top of the wheel rotates away from the mouse) then a scroll bar moves up, and text in the window moves down.
[18:12:58] <cbreak> if you're working frame based, events aren't really needed, you can just query the current wheel position when you need it by polling
[18:13:03] <CarloWood> cbreak: working on a graphical application with a render loop n stuff
[18:14:09] <CarloWood> If you think really hard about it... what would be the only one correct thing to do when you scroll the wheel up... Call on_wheel_event(3) or on_wheel_event(-3)?

[18:14:54] <cbreak> check the documentation of your OS / input library
[18:14:59] <cbreak> there's probably a platform convention
[18:15:18] <cbreak> (on MacOS the scroll direction is configurable for example, and you'd better follow what the user chose)
[18:15:54] <CarloWood> I'm basically writing everything, so there isn't convention in play here.

[18:17:24] <Shell> CarloWood: I'd avoid this problem and pass in an Up/Down enum and an unsigned integer. :)
[18:17:30] <cbreak> mouse wheel rotating counterclockwise when looking at the wheel from the left side of the mouse should scroll the content down, and the view up, going backwards. So the numbers should be negative.
[18:18:05] <cbreak> unless scroll direction is inverted
[18:18:56] <CarloWood> hmm k.  I use negative numbers at the moment.  I DID have to negate them again though before passing them to Dear ImGui; apparently they use a different convention then.
[18:19:47] <Shell> in general if it must be signed I'd consider positive to be "downwards" from the scrollbar perspective.
[18:20:42] <CarloWood> My own reasoning was that 'up' means the cursor goes up - which means decreasing y coordinate on the vulkan (and xcb) platform.  I think openGL has the y axis inverted and I guess that's why imgui got it inversed.
[18:21:46] <CarloWood> A stronger argument even is that this offset is a vector: there is also an x axis ;).  When I move my wheel to the left I get something that if passed as-is is -1 ... aka, one to the left.

[18:24:14] <CarloWood> No that is not true... I just get mouse buttons.  But 'WheelLeft' *should* be -1.
[18:25:10] <CarloWood> And once you realize that you see that it is an x coordinate and thus WheelUp should be the y coordinate, and then up is -1 in my case.
[18:25:47] <CarloWood> On the other hand ... you could argue that scrolling the wheel up makes the mouse move downwards I guess :/

[19:47:09] <Alipha> xkoncek: I would just keep the received udp numbers (assuming you use an incrementing sequence) in a std::set where the key represents a consecutive range of packet numbers that you've received
[19:47:26] *** Quits: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[19:47:49] <xkoncek> why simple when i can do it complex?
[19:49:13] <Alipha> Then when you receive a new packet, you find out if it's adjacent to a range already in the set and add it to that element. And then check to see if the adjacent range can be combined with the current range because they now together form a consecutive range.
[19:50:05] <xkoncek> yeah, i want to do something like that but with heaps
[19:50:34] <xkoncek> so... i have unsigned 16-bit sequence number inside each udp message
[19:51:14] <Alipha> I'm not sure what heaps buy you
[19:51:22] <xkoncek> the receiver holds the last number of a completed range

[19:52:30] <xkoncek> after receive i do two subtractions in both ways to see if the number is from the future or from the past
[19:53:09] <xkoncek> if it is from the future, i put the message into a heap there the heap comparison function is again subtraction from the number that the receiver holds
[19:53:37] <xkoncek> *where
[19:54:20] <xkoncek> call to top() will get me the closest udp packet to process
