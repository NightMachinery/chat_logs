[11:33:01] <chronon> The huge buttons in title bars of windows is what I object to. The title bars of such windows no longer disappear into the Unity menu bar, they take up twice as much space below it, and often that's for buttons I rarely use, and there's no way to collape them away.
[11:33:32] <alkisg> There's no unity menu bar. The bigger title bars are for hi-dpi

[11:35:30] <chronon> Some of these new style apps have a button in the title bar that I believe means Menu, but the menu that appears is never complete. And instead of opening up as the mouse passes over, you have to keep clicking and watching an animation as the submenu slides into place. Productivity killer.

[11:37:51] <chronon> That sounds good.
[11:37:53] <matsaman> Unity was never that mature, it was pretty experimental its entire time
[11:38:03] <alkisg> I left vanilla Ubuntu for MATE when they started Unity, so I can't really compare them. I can tell you that it's mature/stable though.
[11:38:03] <matsaman> but you could probably still use Unity now if you want
[11:38:05] <chronon> Maybe but it worked really well for me.

[11:39:38] <chronon> I wonder if I could install Unity under Ubuntu MATE. That would presumably give me a space saving desktop, plus apps that were properly designed for a desktop environment instead of trying to look like smartphone apps. Right?
[11:40:14] <matsaman> so
[11:40:23] <matsaman> I'm not 100% sure which Unity experience you're talking about
[11:40:36] <matsaman> but Unity was basically a window manager combined with what mostly was GNOME 3
[11:40:40] <alkisg> chronon: the apps are the same in any distribution and desktop environment
[11:40:46] <matsaman> now Ubuntu is apparently using plain entirely GNOME 3
[11:41:01] <matsaman> if you can get unity7/8/lomiri whatever to install & run, you can probably use it with GNOME 3 in a similar fashion
[11:41:18] <alkisg> If the applications you're using have been upgraded to the new gnome guidelines, they'll be the same in any distro/de
[11:41:19] <matsaman> but sure, MATE/MATE+Unity might give you a similar experience to what you were used to also
[11:41:22] <chronon> Ah, so using MATE is not going to save me from the fat title bar buttons?
[11:41:33] *** Joins: Leoneof (~Leoneof@user/leoneof)
[11:41:42] <alkisg> chronon: for example, mate has *forked* gedit into pluma. Pluma doesn't have these buttons
[11:41:44] <matsaman> chronon: well, it might not, but my point is that you likely do not need to make such a large change to avoid this issue
[11:42:01] <alkisg> But this is true only for the "desktop environment apps", not for "additional apps"
[11:42:26] <chronon> Ah, so MATE is philosophically againt the fat title bar buttons? If so, I want to give them money.
[11:42:58] <alkisg> MATE emerged as a fork of gnome2 because they didn't like the new directions, yeah
[11:43:21] <alkisg> But for example, 2-3 applications in mate are not forked, so they still have the big buttons. They might get forked in the future.
[11:43:48] <matsaman> chronon: it probably is
[11:43:55] <chronon> It is amazing to me that someone, RedHat?, is able to do something so destructive to the user experience, and push it out into every other desktop and distro whether they ant it or not. How does that level of influence and control come about?
[11:43:59] <matsaman> chronon: MATE spawned from people being philosophically against a ton of GNOME changes
[11:44:15] <matsaman> chronon: no not Red Hat, this time
[11:44:16] <alkisg> chronon: they're the ones that pay the developers that write the code
[11:44:26] <matsaman> the leadership of the GNOME project has long been kinda bananas
[11:44:44] <matsaman> KDE made a similar huge change, too, though
[11:44:48] <chronon> bananas? Please elaborate.
[11:44:56] <matsaman> it's hard to find projects that set goals, meet those goals, and then _stop tinkering_
[11:45:03] <matsaman> unfortunately that's the human condition
[11:45:13] <matsaman> Xfce is a pretty good example, though
[11:45:33] <chronon> I'm totally with you matsaman. I just want stability. Get it right and then stop fiddling.
[11:45:48] <matsaman> I've had very few surprises with Xfce over many, many yeras
[11:45:49] <matsaman> years*
[11:46:25] <chronon> There is an Ubuntu Xfce flavour I think. Can't remember its name.
[11:46:45] <chronon> Xubuntu?
[11:47:02] <chronon> Is that still well supported?
[11:47:06] <matsaman> sure, but you can just install Xfce or the desktop metapackage
[11:47:23] <matsaman> I'm beginning to think you're talking about a GTK change, though
[11:47:34] <matsaman> it's annoying how much GTK is tied to GNOME, but
[11:47:40] <matsaman> you can simply config your way out of this
[11:47:50] <matsaman> if you've never had to config your way out of a change you didn't like before, consider yourself lucky
[11:47:53] <matsaman> this won't be the last time
[11:48:00] <chronon> I have to suppurt a number of other people (friends, clients, family) so I'm looking for an out of the box experience as much as is possible.
[11:48:11] <matsaman> yeah, but

[11:49:10] <matsaman> LTS isn't really about stability

[11:49:38] <chronon> I have work to do. I don't want to waste part of every day fretting over how to reverse config changes that were pushed onto me.

[11:51:04] <alkisg> KDE too. No DE too. The buttons are in the app, not in the DE.
[11:51:26] <matsaman> if you have GNOME apps you can't replace (weird, but arguably possible), you'll be in trouble

[11:52:05] <chronon> So I want to choose carefully and then go all in on a DE that is philosophically committed to a stable and productive environment, that doesn't waste space, and doesn't chase new gimmicks for the sake of it.
[11:52:17] <matsaman> from some casual browsing, it seems like a pretty simple CSS-style rule you can pop into your GTK config
[11:52:26] <matsaman> which will probably work for the lifespan of GTK 3
[11:52:36] <matsaman> er, 4 I guess
[11:52:58] <matsaman> chronon: sounds smart
[11:53:16] <matsaman> I'd say Xfce is the easiest choice to investigate at this time

[11:55:28] <chronon> I wonder why Gnome did not provide a config option, so that people could still get the tranditional layout, and not be forced into putting fat buttons in title bars.
[11:55:46] <matsaman> they did, but I know what you mean -- and _easy_ config option
[11:55:51] <matsaman> that isn't GNOME's way

[11:56:50] <matsaman> yup
[11:56:54] <chronon> To globally turn off the fat buttons?
[11:57:25] <chronon> And restore the full and complete app menus?
[11:57:30] <matsaman> almost certainly
[11:57:33] <alkisg> The developers go to their code and remove the menus and replace them with popovers etc. You can't undo hard code removal. You can only mitigate some stuff by moving the popover elsewhere.
[11:58:27] <chronon> Well, what is the config option you are alluding to?
[11:59:34] <chronon> And if the code for menus and sensibly placed dialogue buttons has actually been hacked out of the code base of numerous large important apps, then I tihnk the whole world has gone bonkers.
[12:01:10] <alkisg> That's exactly the reason why migrating an app from gtk2 to gtk3 may take months, and then to gtk4 more months. For gimp, it needs years...
[12:01:39] <matsaman> it's a total pain in the butt sometimes, but you should be able to fix it from GTK's regular config/style system
[12:01:50] <alkisg> But functions get deprecated and then removed in later versions; if you want your app to keep using gtk, you need to obey

[12:24:43] <matsaman> it'd be nice if someone forked GTK and stopped fiddling with it for a while
[12:25:08] <chronon> Or maybe they are drinking the coolaid too. Maybe I should get myself some of that and convince myself that fat buttons and thick titlebars are really a space saving rather than a waste of scpace, and that limiting the accessibility and discoverability of menus is somehow a good thing.
[12:25:29] <matsaman> I don't think I'd worry about the space, but
[12:25:33] <matsaman> not sure I care for the style regardless
[12:25:50] <matsaman> anyway, I'm not sure why you use open source software, but this is the #1 reason I do

[17:53:54] <izzy_> Hi, I'm on Ubuntu 20.04.3. How do I install a pkg-config file for udisks2?
[17:55:26] <leftyfb> izzy_: like any other package. But why do you need pkg-config for udisks2? Did you try just: sudo apt install udisks2?
[17:55:51] *** Joins: Darius10467 (~detsremmu@c-98-242-108-101.hsd1.ga.comcast.net)
[17:57:05] <izzy_> leftyfb: I need it for an application I maintain that uses udisks2, so the CMake file is looking for it. sudo apt install udisks2 doesn't do anything because it's installed by default on this version of Ubuntu if I'm not mistaken.
[17:57:29] <izzy_> But yes, I tried that, and apt told me udisks2 was already installed.
[17:57:39] <leftyfb> izzy_: then you're done.
[17:57:58] <izzy_> There is no udisks2.pc file in /usr/lib/pkgconfig though
[17:58:34] <izzy_> And cmake can't find udisks2 either.
