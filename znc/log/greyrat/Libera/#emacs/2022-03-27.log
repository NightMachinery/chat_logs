[04:16:31] <johnjaye> i.e. it's all inside unless and when blocks
[04:16:58] <johnjaye> idk i can tinker with it later. anything in particular you'd like me to look for?

[04:17:43] <parsnip> thought it was a valid way to determine if a user issue lies in config, or a way to narrow things down
[04:17:56] <johnjaye> as far as i can tell it is. but not sure
[04:18:04] <johnjaye> it definitely disables loading of all doom packages it downloads.
[04:18:12] <johnjaye> since all that is installed in .doom.d

[04:24:15] <parsnip> the "ideal" is factoids that don't have ,more, but it's not a rule
[04:24:19] <parsnip> i don't
[04:24:22] <johnjaye> ok
[04:24:27] <parsnip> but everyone edits it
[04:24:43] <johnjaye> i thought maybe deleting everything in an entry should be a consult the maintainer type thing
[04:25:15] <parsnip> there's commands to reorder and remove items
[04:25:29] <johnjaye> i'll think about what you said. maybe the doom maintainer would take a PR to add some steps to troubleshoot if it's emacs or whatever

[07:19:48] <edrx> technomancy: what is TCO?
[07:19:51] <drakonis> python's bug tracker is now on github
[07:19:53] <drakonis> wtf
[07:19:56] <libfud> jensen: yes
[07:20:01] <drakonis> edrx: tail call optimization
[07:20:12] <edrx> jensen: I use lua-mode a lot, but without LSP
[07:20:23] <libfud> I have to use eglot when I SSH to my workstation because
[07:20:25] <libfud> reasons
[07:20:27] <libfud> I guess
[07:20:34] <edrx> drakonis: thanks!
[07:20:42] <libfud> LSP via tramp is a bit... flaky in my experience
[07:20:45] <libfud> takes a ton of work
[07:20:48] <drakonis> https://snarky.ca/a-reverse-chronology-of-some-python-features/
[07:20:55] <corwin> libfud: lots of people do that but it hasn't felt as comfortable for me as writing different packages for groups of functionality and having a custom code to load ones I'm not always loading each time I restart Emacs.
[07:21:17] <drakonis> https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/index.html for something in depth
[07:21:22] <libfud> corwin: fair point
[07:21:41] <drakonis> python got pattern matching in 3.10
[07:21:45] <corwin> libfud: literate style so far has only worked well for me when I've just got a few files of installable code that I'm tangling.
[07:21:49] <drakonis> october of last year wtf
[07:22:01] <libfud> I have a relatively simple config
[07:22:11] <libfud> it's mostly been a set it and forget it affair
[07:22:29] <libfud> but I find it far easier to navigate than a big block of code because of the organization
[07:22:42] <yeti> finding the right language features or libs to solve some problem in python often takes longer than writing the whole stuff in awk
[07:22:56] <yeti> python turned overkill after 1.x
[07:23:05] <drakonis> did it really?
[07:23:05] <libfud> python has some really good libraries (due to popularity mostly I think)
[07:23:48] <corwin> libfud: my stuff is here, I guess you can see for yourself.  some bits are messy buy mostly I can find then remember what I was thinking when I go to make changes to some bit.
[07:23:55] <corwin> libfud: https://git.sr.ht/~mplscorwin/dotfiles
[07:23:55] <libfud> if it didn't have qt bindings and a particular astronomy/orbital mechanics library I wouldn't be using it for a certain application at work
[07:24:11] <drakonis> yeti: that's quite the claim
[07:24:52] <edrx> I spent something that felt like months - or years, or centuries - trying to learn Python and matplotlib at the same time, just because everybody was saying that they wonderful and easy and super powerful

[07:26:31] <corwin> drakonis: easy. because perl 5 is too damned good and the mess of code people of talk of in terms of it's internals makes more and more sense the more "mature" any alternative (include raku) grows.
[07:27:01] <corwin> perl can be hard for some people to learn, i think.
[07:27:13] <drakonis> raku is no longer quite an alterative these days though but sure
[07:27:25] <corwin> once perl makes sense to you, however, it's darned easy to use for most non-heroic tasks
[07:27:53] <drakonis> or maybe i'm reading your message wrong
[07:28:06] <drakonis> but why would perl's internals make more sense as the alternatives grow?
[07:28:36] <corwin> most alternatives end up with a lower bar to meaningful first useful product of learning, but then have a larger climb associated with each next task until expert level is achieved.
[07:29:02] <edrx> then I started to play with Maxima, that by default calls gnuplot to plot graphics, and in a few days I was able to plot many things that I needed, and to write my own gnuplot code

[07:33:05] <corwin> drakonis: I think that's a pretty valid point. I think this was specifically considered as part of the initial design and raku does try to consider this within the problem space.  but perl's too damned fun and easy to use, so it's not really getting a proper test :P
[07:33:06] <libfud> yes
[07:33:26] <drakonis> raku is also too damned fun and i wish people gave it a chance!

[15:40:35] <minikN> Hello, is there an easy way to change the name of a prefix key? For example, npm-mode sets its keymap to `C-c n` by default. I use which-key and if I press C-c, it lists n as in `n -> +prefix`. But ideally I'd like to change `+prefix` to `NPM` or so. Is there an easy way to do that?

[15:45:46] <bpalmer> minikN: hmm, sounds like npm-mode is tramping conventions. Major modes get C-c C-<letter>; C-c <letter> is supposed to be reserved to the user.

That works just fine. But I want to reuse the existing keymap npm-mode offers instead of redefining every key.

[20:15:05] <Plazma> i do know i'm trying to rely less on the mouse/trackpad for going back and forth between things, and figuring out if i want to use evil-mode or not for keybindings, granted i'm somewhat used to emacs default key bindings
[20:15:17] <sonny> mouse in emacs is good
[20:15:32] <sonny> could be better but it is productive for me
[20:15:44] <Plazma> it's more the mouse in general vs just using keyboard

[20:16:29] <sonny> mark is for selection
[20:16:53] <Plazma> i guess at this point i want to just get better with it and trying to optimize a way to do that
[20:16:55] <sonny> the menu also provides ways to get to know emacs, especially with modes
[20:17:19] <sonny> better at what?
[20:17:45] <artefact> what really saved me some time was learning to use the built-in codegen/compile/view features of auctex. i used to complain about having to type \{} a lot, that's mostly gone away now

[20:19:52] <Plazma> ahh yea i do need to start using auctex more, i use overleaf now

[20:23:37] <Plazma> id rather just have it all in latex and then render to pdf and view it
[20:23:41] *** Joins: Skarn (~skarn@user/skarn)
[20:24:20] <thblt> Depending on what you mean by inline, it can be quite useful (and of course AucTeX can do it).  I'm referring to the targeted, in-buffer rendering of complex snippets, eg math.
[20:24:52] <Plazma> inline where yea, it renders it directly around the text part, so equations oar matricies
[20:24:53] <Plazma> or*
[20:25:10] <Plazma> for simple stuff it's great but i've found it more difficult to go back and correct
[20:25:15] <Plazma> once it's rendered inline
[20:25:30] <Plazma> like it seemed like more work overall for me, instead of just correcting the latex code and rendering
[20:25:57] <artefact> for other modes like c, php or rust i don't use anything special beyond indent and very basic font-lock. i never bother to grok an autocompletion framework, or stuff like tags/jump to definition etc

[23:15:25] <belgin> hello! is it possible to get emacs to complete a word correctly even if the letter casing is wrong?
[23:16:33] <belgin> like if my buffer contains "SomeVariable" and i type "SOM" and press the completion key, it will fill it with "Somevariable" or something like that. this is obviously wrong

[23:19:16] <roadie> wont it just take the first candidate? Do you have a SOM sequence in the buffer?
[23:19:27] <belgin> try it yourself
[23:19:31] <belgin> open a new instance of emacs
[23:19:31] <roadie> ok
[23:19:47] <belgin> the completion is M-/
[23:20:44] <jlf> i think getting it to complete mixed-case symbols like that might be a tad ambitious, but it might be possible - have you checked out  M-: (info "(emacs) Dabbrev Customization")  ?
[23:21:26] <roadie> it works here - picks the one with the casing I use in typing
[23:22:03] <roadie> SOM - Som no matter where the vars are located in the buffer
[23:22:33] <belgin> perhaps i explained wrong. i will make a video
[23:22:40] <roadie> but I might misunderstand
[23:23:01] <e1f> m-/ should complete based on the contents of the buffer
[23:23:11] <e1f> previously typed
[23:23:25] <e1f> does it happen if you start emacs -q

[23:39:38] <aidalgol> belgin: You might get the behaviour you want with by setting both `dabbrev-case-distinction' and `dabbrev-case-replace' to `nil'
[23:39:51] <belgin> ok i'll try. thank you
[23:42:19] <belgin> aidalgol, it works, but now there's a delay between when i press M-/ and when it fills the completion :(
[23:42:40] <belgin> and i have to press some other key for it to complete. so strange
[23:43:01] <aidalgol> belgin: That's very strange.  I've never noticed delays with dabbrev, even on my slower machines.
[23:43:19] <belgin> it waits for me to press another key like up arrow or something
[23:43:33] <belgin> oh never mind. now it works fine
[23:43:39] <wgreenhouse> what is C-h k M-/
[23:43:44] <belgin> i must be in the twilight zone or something lol
[23:44:53] <aidalgol> wgreenhouse: This isn't Jeopardy! :P
[23:46:05] <wgreenhouse> I wanted to make sure we are dealing with dabbrev-expand and not some nightmarish replacement
[23:46:21] <aidalgol> Oh, I know.  Just couldn't resist being a smartarse.
[23:46:51] <belgin> M-/ runs the command dabbrev-expand (found in global-map), which is an
[23:46:51] <belgin> autoloaded interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘dabbrev.el’.
