[07:58:49] <beach> I suspect Jacobis9000 just had a problem with functions not having side effects.
[07:59:20] <beach> It would have been good to try to figure that out, rather than bringing up the difference between symbols and characters. 
[08:04:04] <beach> rotateq: If you are going to help newbies, you might need to think harder about pedagogy.  You have to take time to determine how they think and what they expect.  And you must especially avoid giving way too much information that might be unrelated to their problem right away.  You can do that later.

[08:23:23] <beach> rotateq: Otherwise, your remarks just come across as "I know more than you do".
[08:24:27] <beach> rotateq: There is no reason why the function ADD-VOWELS defined by Jacobis9000 wouldn't work, so it would have been better to try to figure out why Jacobis9000 thought it didn't.

[11:37:05] <rotateq> beach: Wasn't intended in any way like that. I should stop doing it.
[12:08:59] <beach> I understand it was not intended, but you can see how it would have that effect, right?
[12:09:03] <beach> So just be careful.
[12:11:52] <rotateq> Yes, so I'll try not to put in my two cents.
[12:12:47] <beach> That is NOT what I am saying.  I am saying, try to figure out what the problem is, perhaps by asking more, and if you know the solution, you should definitely help out.
[12:13:28] <rotateq> Yes I know, but it comes up inside me as I know I never can be what I wish to.
[12:13:40] <rotateq> You're right of course.
[12:13:41] <beach> Like (union <something> <something-else>) can't possible not work just because <something> is a list of symbols rather than a list of characters.
[12:14:25] <beach> So in this case, it as unhelpful to bring that up until you could figure out what the problem was. 
[12:15:07] <beach> It is important to try to put yourself in the situation of the person having problems.
[12:19:08] <rotateq> Yes and maybe you don't believe me, but I really have 1:1 personal experience by working with teaching growing ups. I learned more from them than I could ever give back. Sometimes it doesn't kick in and communicating just by text is hard.
[12:20:04] <beach> I have no reason to not believe you.  And yes, communicating is hard, which is why I am trying to give you some hints here.
[12:20:40] <rotateq> Okay thank you. I often see myself than again very negative.
[12:20:57] <rotateq> Thanks for your hints, as always.
[12:22:31] <beach> Lack of self confidence might be another problem you have.  I find that the best remedy is to make sure you know what you are talking about, by learning more, and by avoiding topics that you don't know much about.  Where "you" here, means all of us, and not just you personally. 
[12:25:00] <rotateq> I try to. As in simple things even a master can often learn more.
[12:25:36] <beach> Absolutely. 
[12:26:01] <rotateq> Like some weeks ago with this simple cross sum, as in cross sum of 123 is 1 + 2 + 3. Then I looked hmm how to in APL and yes, very condense and a new view point on it.
[12:28:29] <beach> I see.
[12:29:25] <rotateq> Six glyphs for everything and multiple bases. :)
[12:30:03] <rotateq> Was just intended as a newer example from what I realized it even more.
