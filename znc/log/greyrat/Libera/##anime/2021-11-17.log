[11:54:45] <MootPoot> Wha...why is satin creampie-ing me 
[11:54:48] <Satin> no
[11:54:53] <Satin> white pudding is a food
[11:54:55] <Satin> ive never had it but still
[11:54:58] <midgardlol> to think I used dial up till mid 2000s
[11:54:58] <Satin> black pudding
[11:55:00] <MootPoot> I didn't expect this
[11:55:01] <Satin> and white pudding
[11:55:07] <Satin> it's blood
[11:55:09] <Satin> or smth
[11:55:18] <zoidberg> it hasn't even been 5min and there goes the conversation
[11:55:27] <emmeka> midgardlol it had modems that could just direct dial a number and just turn your phone line into a direct connection to another console. It actually still works today

[11:55:59] <emmeka> if for some reason you have a landline phone, or even a VOIP phone, you can play Sega Saturn games online to this day
[11:56:12] <Satin> what conversation sagan
[11:56:14] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I have not had this problem in Android, but tomako's phone kept on not accepting her Apple ID password and it was also asking for her defunct iPad passcode. I had to call Apple support to fix the problem. Seems it also may have had something to do with accepting apple's new EULA
[11:56:56] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but to be honest, at least iPhone has a support number I can call
[11:57:01] <zoidberg> nevermind that Satin 
[11:57:09] <zoidberg> nyanpasu o/ amigojapan

[11:57:21] <amigojapan> zoidberg: nyanpasu- o/
[11:57:23] <midgardlol> @emmeka, to think that nowadays we have to create VPNs because multiplayer is dead on xbox and sega saturn still works fine
[11:57:31] <midgardlol> thats some future proofing
[11:57:43] <zoidberg> amigojapan: I've seen your highlight after. I didn't know you get Tuna from India.
[11:59:31] <amigojapan> zoidberg: ah yeah. You know one tuna can cost like 5000usd in the toyosu fish market? I don't know if it is the same with tuna from India

[11:59:45] <emmeka> midgardlol a while ago I did actually look at Phantasy Star Online private servers (I actually own a gamecube broadband adapter) and there's still plenty of people on them. But yeah, the sheer simplicity of the Sega Saturn method of online play makes it basically future proof.
[12:00:35] <emmeka> it will continue to work so long as VOIP phones and standard phone jacks continue to exist
[12:00:36] <zoidberg> amigojapan: I just checked, it is around 1-5 usd per kg
[12:00:37] <amigojapan> emmeka: is it dual up?
[12:00:50] <emmeka> amigojapan it's even more primitive. it direct dialed the other console.
[12:00:52] <Satin> MootPoot: what kind of moosics do u listen to
[12:01:34] <MootPoot> Satin: mostly it's just either instrumentals or its weeb songs 
[12:01:46] <Satin> no electronic etc?
[12:02:05] <amigojapan> zoidberg: hmm but 5000uad would mean the first world be 1000kg.i don't think it is now than 100kg
[12:02:09] <MootPoot> Some, but I put that in the instrumental
[12:02:16] <Satin> i c i c
[12:02:19] <MootPoot> Stuff like unreal superhero
[12:02:26] <midgardlol> MootPoot, ask for amigojapan for some spanish anime rap 
[12:02:33] <amigojapan> emmeka: that is dial up but on
[12:02:42] <zoidberg> amigojapan: I see. I think it will be lot cheap in coastal cities.
[12:03:56] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I guess fish from India is much cheaper than local fish. But still cost similar price in Japanese supermarkets
[12:04:04] <emmeka> amigojapan like literally to play Sega Saturn online you would enter a phone number and then the "net link" attachment would directly dial that number, and if on the other end that line was plugged into a Sega Saturn, it'd answer and you'd be connected
[12:04:40] <amigojapan> Yes emmeka that's dial up
[12:05:09] <amigojapan> emmeka: like a BBS with the other sega being the BBS
[12:05:13] <emmeka> well, yes, but in this case you don't need dial up internet service or access to the internet.
[12:05:32] <zoidberg> amigojapan: the labor and infrastructure are lot cheap here compared to Japan
[12:05:43] <amigojapan> emmeka: I did not say "internet"
[12:05:48] <midgardlol> japan post is still not sending ems or airmail to my country

[12:06:30] <amigojapan> Ouch midgardlol 
[12:06:55] <emmeka> well, most people would take "dial up" to mean "dial up internet service" and not "BBS"
[12:07:06] <emmeka> but even BBS was less primitive than this
[12:07:42] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I see, it's a shame if we don't pay good money for something that is so expensive in Japan. Or at least the price in the supermarket should be much cheaper if it is from India
[12:07:54] <emmeka> this is like a phone line equivalent of booting a Commodore 64 program by having a cassette tape scream digital nonsense at it
[12:08:22] <MootPoot> amigojapan: upsides of having paid support I guess

[13:29:36] <MootPoot> honestly
[13:29:44] <MootPoot> you shouldnt really be using OOP
[13:29:50] <MootPoot> imo
[13:30:17] <MootPoot> oop starts shining in like projects with 10k+ lines of code and multiple people
[13:30:30] <MootPoot> It sounds to me like you're making a utility
[13:31:11] <MootPoot> ( and it also sounds like you didnt bother architecting any of this shit out and testing it in isolated chuncks before you tried to build it all )

[13:34:23] <theholyduck> i mean even then a lot of even LARGE open source projects shun OOP like its the plague 
[13:34:43] <theholyduck> im not a programmer but i understand its somewhat hated at times
[13:34:47] <MootPoot> theholyduck: oop is very easily misused methodology
[13:35:16] <MootPoot> I feel like the hate it gets its because its taught as the default  without REALLY understanding why its  important or the details 
[13:35:25] <MootPoot> and then that leads to bad implementations
[13:35:29] <MootPoot> which leads to bad experiences
[13:36:09] <theholyduck> i mean i think that is also true. but like i think as a general rule most like low level. this needs to be reasonably fast open source projects are C and like explicitly picked C over C++

[13:38:20] <Satin> Anyways, one of my goals was to add a GUI to it.
[13:38:27] <MootPoot> mmhmm
[13:38:43] <Satin> I realized C is a bit.... you know, a bit out of the way but I still want to do it, I've withdrawn from classes and I'm going to go through here.
[13:38:52] *** Joins: Mr_Miser1 (~weechat@27.34.108.134)
[13:39:00] <Satin> I tried Qt a few days ago and then stumbled into the whole C++ here and everywhere shit. I didn't like that one bit.
[13:39:19] <Satin> So I went down the GTK route instead, which is better for C apparently. Despite people on Discord and elsewhere sneering a bit at it recently.
[13:39:39] <theholyduck> Satin: how fancy do you want your GUI to be. if it sfor linux you could make a ncurses gui
[13:39:44] <Satin> I discover that GTK4 is rather.......abrupbtly extremely different from GTK3, and the developers are getting flak here and there for reinventing yet again, and so on.
[13:40:10] <Satin> And there's not that many resources. It genuinely feels like i'm one of the newest ones using GTK4 or something lol
[13:40:25] <Satin> And I'm looking at old tutorials, widgets, connecting it to the new, it's a process.
[13:40:26] <theholyduck> gtk4 is like what less than a year old 
[13:40:30] <Satin> Yes.
[13:40:36] <theholyduck> and yeah theres some drama about it
[13:40:36] <Satin> And I'm referencing demos directly and such.
[13:40:44] <theholyduck> not that suprising you would have a hard time
[13:40:45] <Satin> It's not bad but it's new.
[13:40:47] <Satin> Anyways
[13:40:55] <Satin> I think I'm getting a real grasp on some of this
[13:41:07] <theholyduck> again. ncurses is best gui 
[13:41:10] <Satin> but one major hurdle right now in converting the program and displaying it to the GUI, for each JSON entry
[13:41:15] <theholyduck> i used it to add guis to shell scripts back in the days :D 
[13:41:18] <Satin> is GTK requires "GObjects"
[13:41:24] <Satin> and this is where the Object orientedness comes in
[13:41:42] <Satin> I need to define my own GObject of some sort for the whole thing to work
[13:41:49] <HeTo> Satin: modern GUIs in Qt are QML, not C++, although it's true that at least for a part of the application you're almost certainly going to have to use C++ (or Python)

[13:55:05] <HeTo> Satin: are you sure it makes sense to have a separate GObject for each book entry? from what I glanced it looks like GTK is kind of similar to Qt in that you have a single instance of a book entry model that knows about all book entries and will give you info about one given an index
[13:55:37] <Satin> HeTo: it's not for each book entry

[13:59:52] <Satin> ^
[13:59:56] <MootPoot> If I play a YT video and a game on different monitors
[14:00:01] <MootPoot> the game will eat up 100% of gpu
[14:00:06] <MootPoot> and video will lag
[14:00:15] <Bco1981> video is a video decoder
[14:00:22] <MootPoot> idk why it does that
[14:00:23] <MootPoot> but it does
[14:00:38] <MootPoot> It also only happens with some games , not all
[14:00:48] <MootPoot> so maybe those games are somehow using the video decoder as well
[14:00:52] <Satin> HeTo: but fundamentally, each GoObject does go into a GlistModel (the one I'm trying to use is GListStore)
[14:00:55] <Satin> GObject*
[14:01:00] <Satin> HeTo: "The models we use are GListModels. These always contain GObjects, so you will have to provide your data in the form of objects. This is a first notable difference from GtkTreeview, which is using GtkTreeModels directly containing basic types."
[14:01:03] <MootPoot> but anyway the idea was to just plug in the non-game monitors into the secondary gpu
[14:02:30] <Satin> MootPoot: r u sure you won't have compatibiltiy issues etc?

[14:31:13] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, hard to say honestly. It's creepy with weird ghosts that she sees and she doesn't know what will happen if they know she sees them. So she keeps pretending she doesn't while they try to figure out if she sees them. Then there's some glowing tiny fox-looking creatures that exorcise some of the ghosts and they're protected by a larger fox creature. They all speak a language she doesn't understand

[14:32:05] <nym_> DOtSO was cool for the first few episodes, when the girl started to act more like a normal person she became just another shy cute fanservice girl
[14:32:05] <theholyduck> Kaiba
[14:32:20] <theholyduck> nym_: my favorite bit about denpa was the troll fanservice
[14:32:24] <theholyduck> they would set up a fanservice cliche
[14:32:25] <MootPoot> I think I might buy a shotgun this weekend
[14:32:26] <theholyduck> and then NOT do it
[14:32:32] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, you should watch the first episode or two of Mieruko
[14:32:37] <Bco1981> theholyduck: the aunt ?

[14:32:44] <theholyduck> Bco1981: on any of them really
[14:32:47] <MootPoot> And put weeb stickers on it
[14:32:54] <Cryowolf> okay...
[14:32:57] <theholyduck> like a scene where a woman would fall

[15:34:39] <Satin> or provide some firm reason-text-box-comment requirement for why
[15:35:07] <Satin> maybe unlock dislike/like ratio as a video becomes popular or something
[15:35:09] <Bco1981> Satin: i agree, i'm not saying remove the dislikes, but it should have a add reason Why there was a dislike
[15:35:25] <MootPoot> If you see the numbers people have a tendancy to go into herd mode
[15:35:35] <MootPoot> same reason why I dont like IMDB ratings as well
[15:35:36] <Satin> Bco1981: the problem with that idea for me is, I think not everyone has some deeply thought out reason for why they dislike something
[15:35:39] <Satin> and they shouldn't have to
[15:35:40] <MootPoot> you get a more honest opiion
[15:35:46] <MootPoot> if there is no number there
[15:35:55] <Satin> some people are not good at expressing even why, but they should get an opinion because it's a very basic sentiment question
[15:35:59] <Satin> do you like or dislike something
[15:36:02] <Bco1981> they should have to, force them to think about why do i even do this.
[15:36:08] <Satin> the rationalization for why, doesn't always exist
[15:36:15] <Bco1981> just move on if you don't like it and don't want to tell why
[15:36:16] <Satin> even a disabled person should be able to say like or not like
[15:36:27] <Satin> or a slow person whatever the term is
[15:36:59] <Satin> and for me personally, it's too much fricition. I try to spend as little time as possible on the site itself, i just want to watch the content
[15:37:07] <MootPoot> I agree with Bco1981 
[15:37:09] <Satin> like/dislike is a quick sentiment test for that
[15:37:14] <Satin> smh
[15:37:19] <MootPoot> I dont like a un-articulated sentiment test
[15:37:28] <Satin> not everything has to be rationalized
[15:37:33] <MootPoot> it encourages snap decisions and herd mentalitiy
[15:37:35] <Satin> to count
[15:37:40] <MootPoot> It should
[15:37:45] <MootPoot> rationalize as much as possible
[15:37:48] <Satin> no
[15:37:55] <Satin> I think that if you contribute to a serious discussion in politics on twitter or some other forum
[15:38:00] <Satin> yes, you should have the expectation there
[15:38:04] <Satin> to put in effort and think
[15:38:19] <Satin> for entertainment and youtube videos, having to put some thought out answer for why? naa.
[15:38:31] <Bco1981> then don't
[15:38:35] <Bco1981> just move on
[15:38:36] <Satin> why not?
[15:38:45] <Satin> i'm giving a dislike to provide sentiment, others might share it
[15:38:49] <Bco1981> what does it matter if there is no telling why
[15:38:52] <Bco1981> it does not
[15:38:55] <Bco1981> it's useless
[15:38:57] <Satin> i could just find the overall background music annoying, maybe the atmosphere
[15:39:01] <Satin> and i dont' want to write a detailed comment
[15:39:07] <DPA> Just do it like github, gitlab, etc. Different services there (Wiki,Builds,etc.) can be turned on and off by the owner of the repo. I think Like/Dislike buttons are very much a service like that too.
[15:39:10] <Satin> maybe i found a part of a shitpost 30 second youtube anime video a bit annoying
[15:39:17] <Satin> and i hit dislike
[15:39:26] <Satin> it just seems a bit too much/silly for me to sit down and write a comment for why
[15:39:50] <Satin> I try to provide reasons for why if i value the video, e.g. some philosophy lecture etc
[15:40:02] *** Joins: hans (~hans@77.18.99.226.tmi.telenormobil.no)
[15:40:08] <Satin> some shitpost meme clip on youtube? some popular pop musician making something  unoriginal? nah.
[15:40:26] <Satin> hit dislike or like if i like or dislike it and move on
[15:40:40] <Satin> especially if i watch more than a few videos in the course of a day
[15:41:23] <Satin> DPA: yeah but YouTube channels are tied into a broader community
[15:41:35] <Satin> Github, gitlabs are arguably meant to be their own thing ideally
[15:41:51] *** Joins: Sxem (~sxem@pool-108-31-231-10.washdc.fios.verizon.net)
[15:41:51] * ImoutoBot welcomes S‚Äãxem (9 / 91): <S‚Äãxem> most hikikomoris prefer masturbation over the horror of having to socialize with cute girls
[15:41:54] <Satin> and any form of social connections are a bit sparse, e.g. githubs primary way is through people's profiles and that's it
[15:42:09] <Satin> YouTube channels meanwhile play a significant role in social media experience for users
[15:42:22] <Satin> they're not their own entities or something
[15:42:53] <Satin> and i guess I think the real reason youtube is taking away dislikes is because it's too easy to spot marketing/promotional material shit right now
[15:43:10] <Satin> from the dislikes or the fact that the ratio bar isn't there
[15:43:40] <Satin> so people can tell very easily what's going on, and this is just a step in that direction under the name of ""anti bullying""
[15:43:59] <DPA> Like/Dislike is a service provided by youtube, so they can do with it wathever they want. I can also run my own video platform and/or my own like / dislike service, or use one I like more. Everyone should just make things the way they would like them to be.
[15:44:18] <Satin> well see in an ideal world it would be like that
[15:44:24] <Satin> but YouTube is a monolopy
[15:44:31] <Satin> and makes it very hard for other services to exist
[15:44:36] <Satin> vid.me died a hard death
[15:44:40] <death916> odysee/lbry isnt bad
[15:44:44] <Satin> no one pays attention to dailymotion
[15:44:46] <DPA> Then use PeerTube? Maybe host it yourself? It's easy.
[15:44:51] <Satin> vimeo is only used for professionals etc

[15:44:59] <Satin> yeah but at the end of the day it's not what you use
[15:45:05] <Satin> it's are the viewers for there too?
[15:45:21] <MootPoot> Satin: if you dont like it, and you REALLY dont like it enough to already hit the dislike button
[15:45:23] <Satin> of course I can host my own video on my own server or site or somtehing if i want to, that isn't the problem
[15:45:36] <MootPoot> you just write "this is dumb" and dislike
[15:45:57] <Satin> ill type in spam unicode characters and dislike
[15:46:05] <Satin> among us
[15:46:06] <MootPoot> or you just dont even finish the video and you leave without completing it
[15:46:08] <Satin> sus
[15:46:13] <MootPoot> and it'll get it through the watch times
[15:46:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the dislike button does not mean "I don't like YouTube
[15:46:26] <Satin> MootPoot: ‡∂û
[15:46:40] <MootPoot> amigojapan: ???????
[15:46:53] <Satin> amigojapan: he's talking abotu providing a reason before you dislike
[15:47:08] <Satin> berlin and him think there should be a requirement to provide a clear cut reason when you dislike something
[15:47:11] <amigojapan> YouTubers also complain about YouTube all the time
[15:47:12] <Satin> instead of just having the ability to dislike 
[15:47:41] <Satin> I disagree because for me, that's rationalizing too much b) lazy, especially when me and plenty of other users who use youtube heavily can watch from mobile devices, many many videos in a day/week
[15:47:47] <DPA> Having to accept what platforms do is simply the result of people using them and not doing things themself. It's a problem all the people need to solve themself. But they don't want to due to lazyess. Nonetheless, it's the way to go.
[15:48:03] <Satin> DPA: I agree but it's society we're talking about ultimately here
[15:48:13] <Satin> the network effect is too real, and that has an impact on the rest of us
[15:48:15] <DPA> Yes
[15:48:32] <MootPoot> Satin: and the solution to that is that you just dont dislike - just go onto the next video. If you cant be bothered to rationalize your dislike or like - your dislike or like is worthless 
[15:48:47] <Satin> why does a dislike for something have to be rationalized
[15:48:48] <MootPoot> you dont NEED to dislike or like every video to use youtube
[15:48:56] <Satin> why can't i just dislike something because i dislike it
[15:49:05] <Satin> why do i have to provide some clear cut logical reason for why
[15:49:17] <Satin> in your view
[15:49:21] <MootPoot> because we expect humans to have some degree of rational thought 
[15:49:22] <MootPoot> lol
[15:49:32] <Bco1981> Satin: that wont help the person that put in effort to make the video.
[15:49:32] <Satin> i don't, not when it comes to things like this
[15:49:34] <amigojapan> DPA: it's just like money, if every poor person stopped using it, they could bring the rich down. But you can't blame the poor
[15:49:36] <MootPoot> and are not like bacteria
[15:49:39] <MootPoot> which have no thoughts
[15:49:45] <MootPoot> unless you are a bacteria Satin 
[15:50:29] <Satin> Bco1981:  It won't help the person who put in the effort to make the video, I agree, but there is other ways they can figure out what they're doing wrong in my opinion
[15:50:29] <MootPoot> but anyway  - I dont see  the problem, if you dont want to rationalize it due to laziness, why not take your laziness to the next level and not like or dislike it at alll?
[15:50:41] <Satin> not every dislike is supposed to be about rationalized constructive criticism 
[15:50:50] <Satin> even sentiments are fine in such a system
[15:50:54] <Bco1981> yeah, it is.
[15:50:58] <Bco1981> otherwise useless
[15:51:00] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[15:51:12] <Satin> it's okay to have "useless" dislikes in my opinion
[15:51:15] <MootPoot> Satin: answer my counterpoint
[15:51:19] <Satin> it's supposed to be about sentiment after all
[15:51:30] <Satin> MootPoot: it's not entirely about laziness
[15:51:59] <MootPoot> alright, lets reframe it 
[15:51:59] <Satin> it's also about combating the idea that you have to dislike something as widely varied content, youtube videos, consistently with clear cut answers
[15:52:11] <MootPoot> we say it has to be rationalized , you say that it dosent  
[15:52:17] <Satin> here's the opposite counterpoint
[15:52:20] <Satin> to hat you're saying
[15:52:26] <MootPoot> is there anything that says it has to be one way or the other?
[15:52:27] <Satin> MootPoot: imagine you have to provide a reason for every like you provided
[15:52:30] <Satin> on every damm video
[15:52:30] <Satin> ever
[15:52:34] <MootPoot> Satin: I'm okay with that
[15:52:35] <Satin> that you press a like on
[15:52:35] <MootPoot> lol
[15:52:44] <MootPoot> I want that
[15:52:46] <Satin> Bco1981: and you?
[15:52:57] <MootPoot> I dont randomly like 9000000000000000 videos I watch in a day
[15:53:04] <Satin> u don't

[15:53:24] <JesseDesu> i'm working at home rn
[15:53:25] <Satin> imagine having to come up with some concrete reason for why i like this
[15:53:28] <Satin> even though i just do

[15:53:46] <Satin> I have to have some rationalized, specific, reason
[15:53:54] <Satin> i have to write a mini essay basically and come up with points for why i like it
[15:53:55] <MootPoot> Okay, but also, the other counterpoint
[15:53:56] <Satin> in your system
[15:54:04] <MootPoot> STOP right there
[15:54:08] <Satin> you can like things just because you do
[15:54:11] <MootPoot> nobody said this  >i have to write a mini essay basically and come up with points for why i like it
[15:54:12] <amigojapan> I only got like or dislike when I really really care. Which is not often. I don't think I leave a message every time, sometimes I do
[15:54:17] <MootPoot> stop making up our position
[15:54:21] <Satin> well i said "mini" for a reason
[15:54:25] <Satin> you have to come up with points
[15:54:36] <MootPoot> Satin: what's stopping you from just saying "I think this is dumb" and thats it?
[15:54:38] <Satin> why do you like this 30 second clip?
[15:54:52] <Satin> come up with a reason or else you're not allowed to like it
[15:55:02] <Satin> publicly add to the sentiment button*
[15:55:13] <Satin> MootPoot:  that's as unhelpful as anything ever
[15:55:34] <MootPoot> yes, but its basically the same level of communication that you are advocating for
[15:55:35] <MootPoot> lol
[15:55:37] <Satin> if bco was arguing for helpfulness, saying "i think this is dumb" is pretty useless?
[15:55:54] <Satin> it might be the same level sure, but the difference is it's more annoying
[15:55:56] <Satin> to type in
[15:56:03] <MootPoot> then dont
[15:56:04] <MootPoot> again
[15:56:11] <MootPoot> whos forcing you to 
[15:56:19] <Satin> why not, dislikes/likes are useful for sentiment
[15:56:24] <Sxem> they cd make it multiple choice
[15:56:30] <Satin> Sxem: lol
[15:56:33] <Sxem> so its just one extra click
[15:56:43] <Satin> A B C 
[15:56:44] <Satin> D
[15:56:44] <Bco1981> yeah, because that does not specify if it's the subject of the video that is dumb og something that happend or was said.
[15:56:52] <MootPoot> Satin: accurate reasons are much more useful for sentiment then a shitty binary like/dislike
[15:56:56] <MootPoot> if you want to go down that parth
[15:57:05] <Satin> like/dislike are good enough
[15:57:08] <Satin> it's not about accuracy
[15:57:09] <Satin> for sentiment
[15:57:15] <Satin> this isn't marketing
[15:57:24] <MootPoot> Its LITERALLY IS
[15:57:26] <amigojapan> Satin: getting people to agree is usually an undoable task unless they already tend to agree
[15:57:39] <Satin> are we all a marketing corporation!!!
[15:57:40] <MootPoot> the youtube algorithm
[15:57:42] <MootPoot> is literally marketing
[15:57:46] <Satin> well
[15:57:47] <MootPoot> for videos
[15:57:47] <Sxem> i never click like or dislike
[15:57:49] <Satin> technically yeah
[15:58:01] <Sxem> its not worth the wear and tear on the mouse
[15:58:04] <Sxem> i get nothing out of it
[15:58:06] <Satin> lol
[15:58:07] <MootPoot> ^
[15:58:08] <amigojapan> Sxem: I rarely do
[15:58:13] <MootPoot> Sxem: you have it right
[15:58:18] <Satin> i def use like/dislike if i have strong feelings about it
[15:58:23] <MootPoot> if you cant be fucked to do it properly, just dont do it at all
[15:58:24] <Satin> or if i find it annoying
[15:58:26] <Satin> or if i just dislike it
[15:58:28] <Satin> or like it
[15:58:36] <Satin> "lol this is actually based *like"
[15:58:49] <Satin> "eugh cringe *dislike*
[15:58:50] <Satin> "
[15:58:56] <Bco1981> why cringe
[15:59:03] <Satin> because some videos are sheer cringe?
[15:59:07] <Bco1981> why
[15:59:12] <Sxem> i think there are nasty ppl that just click dislike on everything, hoping to make someone cry
[15:59:12] <Satin> they're cringe.
[15:59:17] <Bco1981> why are they cringe
[15:59:25] <Satin> Sxem: that can happen but i think we need some more sophisticated methods
[15:59:30] <Satin> to deal with brigades
[15:59:39] <Satin> rather than ruining the experience for everyone
[15:59:46] <Satin> Bco1981: not they, the video
[15:59:52] <Sxem> i dont mind losing the dislike button. it seems like a weapon
[15:59:52] <Satin> the video can be cringe
[15:59:56] <Satin> intentionally or otherwise
[16:00:07] <Sxem> press the crush my dreams button
[16:00:08] <Satin> Sxem: i do mind, very heavily
[16:00:11] <amigojapan> Satin: likes and dislikes are just random opinions of  people on the internet, they are not objective truth
[16:00:14] <Satin> i want the dislike button bad
[16:00:32] <Satin> amigojapan: of course they aren't, but they're a useful tool for sentiments at a glance of your fellow social media users
[16:00:34] <amigojapan> Satin: same as anime ratings are often wrong
[16:00:46] <Sxem> they can relabel it to 'shit on this youtuber'
[16:00:53] <Satin> it can warn of scams, it can provide signling for rough perceptions on the video
[16:00:57] <amigojapan> Satin: I never go by anime ratings
[16:01:10] <Satin> this sort of thing just rationalizes the whole thing
[16:01:13] <Sxem> i dont need a shit on button
[16:01:17] <Bco1981> "useful tool for sentiments at a glance of your fellow social media users" and how does that help 
[16:01:29] <Sxem> im not into shitting on ppl
[16:01:35] <Satin> i am
[16:01:44] <Satin> well, i don't go out of my way
[16:01:48] <MootPoot> TIL : satin is into scat
[16:01:49] <Satin> but i'm not against it Sxem 
[16:02:35] <Sadale> o_O
[16:02:41] <Sadale> Satin, you ew 
[16:02:42] <Satin> Bco1981:  it helps because there's a bunch of videos that can be scammy, there's other videos where just seeing at a glance what people feel about the video is nice, or how divided opinion is, or how one sided opinion is etc
[16:02:50] <Satin> Sadale: no lol
[16:02:52] <Satin> i'm not
[16:02:56] <Satin> into it
[16:03:00] <amigojapan> Satin: I never give a negative anime rating.i only rate things I really like
[16:03:02] <Sadale> lol
[16:03:15] <Satin> amigojapan: I would give anime ratings
[16:03:16] <MootPoot> Satin: well detailed comments will actually help more with any of those cases then a like/dislike
[16:03:17] <Sadale> I don't get scat fetish tho
[16:03:18] <Satin> that are negative
[16:03:29] <Satin> MootPoot: people don't give a damm about well detailed comments on so many videos
[16:03:34] <Satin> youtube has varied content
[16:03:46] <Sadale> There're just too many comments that you can't view all of them
[16:03:53] <Satin> you think people want to sit down and read some detailed comment (if someone can bullshit themselves into it) for a 30 second meme clip?
[16:03:53] <Sxem> my mal ratings are usually between 4 for bad and 7 for good
[16:04:03] <amigojapan> Satin: mostly my anime ratings are for me to remember what Anime I really like
[16:04:03] <MootPoot> sure, but usually you just need to read like the first 10-20
[16:04:18] <Satin> no, detailed comments are useless and excessive for many things
[16:04:19] <MootPoot> Satin: if its as dumb as a 30 second meme clip, why even bother
[16:04:25] <MootPoot> honest question
[16:04:25] <Satin> MootPoot: why not?
[16:04:33] <Satin> you're asking this seriously
[16:04:34] <MootPoot> because its a 30 second meme clip
[16:04:36] <Satin> in the age of tiktok and memes
[16:04:41] <MootPoot> yes
[16:04:45] <MootPoot> just go on to the next one
[16:04:45] <Satin> and viral vines
[16:04:47] <Satin> how
[16:04:48] <MootPoot> you gain nothing
[16:04:50] <MootPoot> from liking it
[16:04:53] <MootPoot> or disliking it
[16:04:56] <amigojapan> Sxem: I don't even add anime that I think is under 8
[16:05:00] <Satin> it's not about gaining anything, they have prominence when they are widely shared and popular
[16:05:16] <MootPoot> Satin: the watchtimes and the algorithim will handle that 
[16:05:23] <MootPoot> it dosent need like/dislike
[16:05:27] <Satin> this is social media there doesn't have to be some hard coded reasons that are practical to your real life for liking/disliking
[16:05:29] <Satin> consuming content
[16:05:31] <Satin> bruh 
[16:05:46] <Satin> if you want to design a site where "thoughtfulness" is at its core i can understand
[16:05:52] <MootPoot> no I mean really like
[16:05:57] <MootPoot> your 30 second meme clip scenario
[16:06:00] <Satin> but this is a mass social media site where most are expecting to use the sentiment counter in some way or the other 
[16:06:01] <Satin> yeah
[16:06:06] <MootPoot> it dosent need likes to go viral
[16:06:18] <MootPoot> you can just judge it off views
[16:06:20] <MootPoot> and shares

[16:06:37] <Satin> to write a DETAILED comment RIGHT NOw
[16:06:44] <Satin> if you like or dislike it
[16:06:51] <MootPoot> why
[16:06:52] <MootPoot> just dont
[16:07:16] <Satin> and thus never engage with it despite it being extremely popular and widely shared?
[16:07:23] <Satin> don't do the one thing social media is designed for?
[16:07:27] <Satin> ayo?
[16:07:28] <MootPoot> you already engaged with it
[16:07:29] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I guess YouTube should make an easy way to see which videos have been dropped quickly. That would be more useful than dislike
[16:07:40] <MootPoot> you engaged with it by watching it
[16:07:57] <MootPoot> and you engaged with it (maybe) by sharing it here - which you just did
[16:08:00] <Satin> social media engagement
[16:08:03] <Satin> isn't entirely about just views
[16:08:11] <Satin> otherwise we'd have a uh you know
[16:08:14] <Satin> server hosting
[16:08:16] <Satin> and a view counter
[16:08:19] <Satin> and that's it

[16:08:51] <MootPoot> you still havent really made the argument on why anybody who isen't the website itself should care about this
[16:08:53] <Satin> that defeats the features of sites like youtube that provide ways to engage socially with that content?
[16:09:01] <Sadale> I've tried that. It worked. But it gives zero user engagement
[16:09:01] <Satin> it's not just pure video hosting
[16:09:09] <MootPoot> Satin: you have a way to socially engage - the comments
[16:09:18] <amigojapan> Satin: what is more important wold be a counter of who dropped it quickly

[16:09:23] <MootPoot> and by making you write a good one - the level or quality of engagement is higher

[16:10:50] <Sadale> lol MootPoot

[16:13:04] <MootPoot> But anyway - you're making the arugment for social media engagement like you have anything to gain from it 
[16:13:06] <Sadale> As a sub tho getting punished and tortured by Suzuka would turn me on xD
[16:13:12] <KatrinValerie> Help where did I put my glasses, I can't read the chat without them.
[16:13:19] <MootPoot> you're not facebook or google, you gain nothing from engagement 
[16:13:26] <MootPoot> if anything social media is losing you time
[16:13:38] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, good luck finding it, onee-chan <3
[16:13:41] <Satin> my basis isn't what i gain or not gain after all
[16:13:42] <MootPoot> so I dont see why engagement is a argument from a user-perspective
[16:14:04] <amigojapan> Satin: if "rellie kramier"is your real name, your should probably change it to something anonymous before a stalker gets you
[16:14:09] <Satin> because that's why I use youtube and not some server hosted site with a counter, i use it to discover content
[16:14:22] <Satin> and engage with videos and provide sentiment
[16:14:28] <MootPoot> how is this stopping you from doing any of that
[16:14:38] <Sadale> That isn't her real name. She told us about that xD
[16:14:44] <KatrinValerie> Sadale: it's okay, I can use the KDE magnifying glasses and still read the chat.
[16:14:47] <Satin> and get a feel on what other people think, often which comments don't need to do or can't do in the same way that a like/dislike bar can.

[16:35:17] <MootPoot> I turn it off
[16:35:18] <Sadale> Bco1981, I think I've seen screenshots for that long time ago.
[16:35:36] <Cryowolf> Shounen and Seinen don't generally decide the level of gore or blood or violence either though
[16:35:52] <Bco1981> Sadale: i know that back in the day there was some project that could get seamless linux apps in windows
[16:35:55] <Cryowolf> it's the maturity of the story and what type of story, complexity of characters etc
[16:36:00] <ezekielnoob> anyone here who plays genshin impact?
[16:36:03] <Bco1981> can't remember what it was called
[16:36:09] <Satin> Cryowolf: Yes you missed a lot. The broader argument is about YouTube removing the dislike button. Some folks in here think that people should not be able to dislike unless they provide a concrete textual reason/comment first. I'm saying that's too much rationalization and a lot of things are based on sentiments, and are equally valid.

[16:36:24] <amigojapan> Right Cryowolf they just ate determined by which is the target audience of the manga
[16:36:28] <Sadale> Bco1981, I couldn't read English well back then. Nor I've got much linux skill.
[16:36:35] <ezekielnoob> Bco1981 awesome :D
[16:36:40] <ezekielnoob> a lot of my friends play it
[16:36:54] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, damn you made me wanna play it. I don't play it tho.
[16:37:02] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, But now I've got a phone that can be used for playing it
[16:37:03] <Bco1981> ezekielnoob: it's multiplayer ? i thought it was single player
[16:37:04] <ezekielnoob> Sadale it's a gacha game
[16:37:08] <Cryowolf> Satin, oh....I think removing the dislike button is a bad idea cause quite often it could be used to gauge the quality of a tutorial etc
[16:37:09] <rvalue> may be i should start reading Kingdom.. looks like SNK
[16:37:10] <Satin> Moot's point was that "watch time" is far more better a maesure of sentiment than likes/dislikes. He asked for a video I'd dislike even though I watch all the way. I said music videos, you want to complete the whole thing, people rarely stop in music videos, the music's playing, the visuals are still running.
[16:37:10] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, oh wait what? :O
[16:37:15] <ezekielnoob> Bco1981 it's mostly single player
[16:37:24] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, I thought that it was more like an RPG or something.
[16:37:24] <Satin> You can still feel inclined to hit the dislike button after.
[16:37:27] <ezekielnoob> yes it's Gacha but has an mmorpg style of gameplay
[16:37:30] <ezekielnoob> it's both Sadale
[16:37:32] <Sadale> ag
[16:37:34] <Sadale> ah
[16:37:46] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, I remember that isekaijin pays for gacha games.
[16:37:53] <Sadale> he rich :/
[16:38:01] <Cryowolf> I would think having your video dislike would get you to figure out what they didn't like about it and improve that
[16:38:12] <Satin> Cryowolf: the argument's already fleshed out by now and we're going in circles, but ya
[16:38:14] <Cryowolf> and see if the improvements lead to more likes

[16:38:51] <Satin> I agree with brigading/mass dislikes for no justifialbe reason being a problem, I just heavily disagree with the solution here of making it harder to dislike/like with some reason or removing the button
[16:39:16] <Satin> surely there's some more sophisticated way to tackle that without breaking the site's usefulness and usability for the rest of us
[16:39:24] <Satin> I like that dislike bar personally
[16:39:25] <Bco1981> it should be a chore to dislike. you really have to mean it.

[16:39:33] <ezekielnoob> it's like banning all kitchen knives  cause someone used it to stab someone Satin
[16:39:34] <Satin> It shouldn't be
[16:39:40] <Satin> ezekielnoob: i agree
[16:39:46] <Sadale> I wouldn't worry about youtube's mechanism. The site isn't mine. So it's up to them to decide to change their rating system and pretty much everything there.
[16:39:59] <Satin> Bco1981: I agree with you when it comes to ""serious"" videos (though it's impossible how to categorize them differently I guess)
[16:40:13] <ezekielnoob> if we take down anything that is used for bad things, we'll be left with nothing
[16:40:21] <ezekielnoob> anything can be abused
[16:40:24] <Satin> but since youtube is the world's largest site, it also plays host to a plethora of different content, a spectrum of it
[16:40:30] <MootPoot> ezekielnoob: are you talking about our solution or YT's removal of the button
[16:40:35] <Satin> not all of that content requires deliberate thought detalied comments
[16:40:35] <ezekielnoob> yes MootPoot
[16:40:38] <Satin> to dislke or like it
[16:40:39] <Sadale> You know what's the most effective way to generate mass dislike to others videos? That's to use bots.

[16:40:52] <Satin>  MootPoot he means youtube's
[16:40:54] <Sadale> Some people accepts payment to send dislike to vids. And they're cheap
[16:40:57] <Satin> MootPoot: be nice smh
[16:40:58] <ezekielnoob> MootPoot yes the youtube dislike
[16:41:05] <ezekielnoob> but it's more of a general statement that i have made

[16:41:44] <Bco1981> move on to somthing you like
[16:41:45] <Satin> why not?
[16:41:52] <MootPoot> because it wastes your time
[16:41:53] <Satin> why is it bad to express your dislike for something in society
[16:41:57] <Cryowolf> well I can only add my opinion then. You won't really see people with more likes complaining and wanting the removal of dislike button. They could instead change it to a rating system without stars. Which goes from "I enjoyed it" - "I learned from this" - "Relaxing" - "Fascinating & Interesting" -  "Not for me"
[16:41:58] <Bco1981> you don't like then why waste your time on it
[16:41:58] <Satin> it's a popular video
[16:41:58] <MootPoot> on something you dont enjoy
[16:42:00] <Satin> I wanted to know how it sounds

[16:59:40] <Sadale> It's $18600 per year to study in a university here in Hong Kong (China).
[16:59:48] <Satin> many education institutes were crunched?

[17:00:16] <Sadale> actually, even more expensive. Satin said she got charged 6k per semenster, that's 12k per year.
[17:00:21] <MootPoot> That stuff only happened to private unis

[17:19:54] <Berlin36> exactly
[17:20:00] <Sadale> or a decent phone
[17:20:01] <Berlin36> why would you need a fucking shotgun
[17:20:10] <Sadale> anyway it's his money :P
[17:20:13] <Berlin36> when you can put some more and buy a decent laptop
[17:20:20] <Berlin36> yeah Sadale

[17:25:47] <MootPoot> Sadale: for the price difference just get a multi slot adapter and put it in there 
[17:25:53] <MootPoot> You get more slots that way 
[17:25:59] <Sadale> hmm you do have a point
[17:26:01] <MootPoot> If you have a empty PCIe slot 
[17:26:05] <Bco1981> okay... will get 2x2tb then. then i can upgrade mine to 2x4tb later on and i will have 1x2tb for each my kids pc's when they are ready.

[17:49:47] <ButterNoodle> oh

[17:53:14] <KatrinValerie> Are there still any phones with headphone jacks?
[17:53:21] <Jigsy> The headphone jack is a really big thing to me.

[18:09:48] <ButterNoodle> does anyone wanna tell me why my man pusi be itchin at 9:30am in november?
[18:10:00] <Satin> the reason is because visa charges rly high rates

[18:11:29] <ButterNoodle> that was over 20 years ago... fuck that shit
[18:11:42] <Sadale> now the charge goes to the retailer :/

[18:13:36] <Sadale> And the consumer electronics here are cheaper than most of the price I could find online like amazon. :3
[18:13:40] <ButterNoodle> I see it a lot with firearms related things here.. because a lot of processors dont want to deal with them for personal reasons
[18:14:04] <ButterNoodle> either do the cash discount, or blatantly up charge for using a CC
[18:14:16] <Sadale> makes sense.
[18:14:31] <Sadale> cash discount sound nicer tho :P
[18:14:37] <ButterNoodle> in a low margin retail market I honestly think thats fair
[18:14:38] <Sadale> "hey it's a discount :P"
[18:14:42] <Sadale> I agree
[18:15:21] <ButterNoodle> I can just as easily pull cash out of the bank, or do an ACH draft on a checking account

[18:38:11] <Sadale> damn I don't like English pronoun. In my mother tongue there's no gender in pronouns. It makes thing much easier 
[18:38:19] <Sadale> he/she/it are the same here.
[18:38:22] <MootPoot> I have no idea what that gif means Satin 
[18:38:47] <Satin> netiher do i

[18:40:51] <Sadale> I can only do mid-3 stars or at most upper 3 stars.
[18:40:55] <MootPoot> I dont bother with all this new fangled pronouns
[18:41:07] <MootPoot> I can do 3 of them - he, she, or they
[18:41:15] <MootPoot> thats all you get from me
[18:41:15] <Sadale> MootPoot, ah.
[18:41:21] <ButterNoodle> I think cock and cunt are pretty good pronouns
[18:41:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, The they annoys me as well.
[18:41:35] <Sadale> It isn't how the pronoun is supposed to be used :/
[18:41:40] <MootPoot> I'd be okay if we got rid of he and she for they
[18:41:52] * MootPoot shrugs - langauge changes over time
[18:41:56] <MootPoot> less words
[18:42:14] <Sadale> I suspect that this pronoun drama could be stirred up by Russia to generate dishamony between westeners. Some people would comply and call people a "they". Some won't.
[18:42:19] <MootPoot> But I'm not going to bother learning if somebody wants to be called Xillia the vampire lesbian princess
[18:42:43] <Sadale> It's always Russia trying to destabilize the US :P
[18:43:01] <MootPoot> I do wonder why people are so hung up on it though

[18:55:43] <Sadale> zoidberg, lol
[18:55:58] <Sadale> I thought that you were in Germany based on your nick
[18:56:06] <MootPoot> I was almost to late today

[18:56:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, boo
[18:56:43] <Sadale> Berlin36, why wouldn't everyone think that?
[18:56:45] <zoidberg> Sadale, there are many Russian speaking Germans in Germany.
[18:56:51] <Sadale> zoidberg, really?
[18:56:53] <Berlin36> would people think im from uranus if i had "Uranus" in my nick?
[18:56:57] <Berlin36> which is weird af^
[18:57:05] <Sadale> lol that's because we know that no one's living in uranus
[18:57:08] <zoidberg> Yeah sadale, there are.

[18:57:17] <Berlin36> there might be someone in uranus

[18:58:07] <Sadale> Berlin36, I mean if you aren't affiliated with Berlin somehow why would you even put it onto your nick? And if you're affiliated with Berlin, the first thing that's in my mind is that either you're from Berlin or you're living in Berlin
[18:58:53] <MootPoot> If I see a guy with the username Texas420

[22:21:19] <Matt|home> hi Berlin36 o\
[22:21:24] <Berlin36> how are you
[22:21:36] <Matt|home> doing homework and in pain, fine otherwise. you?
[22:21:47] <emmeka> I think the HVAC guy I just called just dropped and broke his phone. I called, I heard him pick up and then go "h-" and then heard *K-K-CRUNCH-CLUNK* and then the call cut. And then I waited a minute an redialed, and I just get the dunnn dunnn dunnn tone like the line is disconnected
[22:21:48] <JenniFurr> Ok Matt|home ask
[22:21:54] <Matt|home> how often do you have to shave
[22:22:19] <Berlin36> i've just finished revising biology(basically just learned now what we learned this past two weeks)
[22:22:23] <MootPoot> emmeka: I guess the HVAC guy is going through mental HVAC right now
[22:22:38] <Berlin36> who do you ask, Matt|home 
[22:22:40] <Matt|home> im going through a pack of razers every three days and it aint cheap
[22:22:43] <Matt|home> JenniFurr
[22:22:49] <Berlin36> oh right
[22:22:57] <Berlin36> now im gonna go revise for chemistry

[22:23:39] <JenniFurr> You know how personal it is to ask right Matt|home ? But if you must know, Bout once a week
[22:24:41] <JenniFurr> Wait, are you referring to my legs? Or...?
[22:24:49] <Berlin36> d u d e
[22:24:51] <Matt|home> i did not think that was a very personal question considering you were sharing your porn tastes :p in any case, that's annoying.. i started an experiment to see if i could keep up with shaving my crotch and armpits
[22:25:02] <Matt|home> i dunno how women do it honestly
[22:25:08] <Berlin36> lol

[22:32:25] <JenniFurr> True, it can be, ever considered permanent removal?
[22:33:54] <DPA> How does that work?
[22:34:00] <Matt|home> i aint that rich.. and im doing this in the vain hopes that the person im attempting to seduce won't want to floss their teeth with my crotch if we ever get intimate :p ah well. i need a break.. god i want to smoke so bad
[22:35:57] <JenniFurr> Smoking is a major turn off, plus you could always shave just before intimacy, you know
[22:36:25] <Matt|home> i don't smoke cigarettes, i was thinking of lighting a bowl but i have a test later today and i need to focus
[22:36:34] <Bco1981> if it starts smoking, need more lube...
[22:37:17] <JenniFurr> Ohh, recreational, I c
[22:37:35] <DPA> I trim my beard once a month or so (not sure how often exactly actually, whenever it becomes too big). If there is some way to become even lazier and avoid that, then I'm interested.
[22:38:02] <Sxem> ive seen laser hair removal guns for like $50
[22:38:10] <Matt|home> lol.. no wonder my answer is wrong. APPARENTLY in german they contracted "in dem" to "im" and it happened so long ago it's no longer considered a contraction.. and apparently it's still debatable if "in dem" is grammatically correct or not
[22:38:13] <Sxem> says you use it every day for 6 months and then the hair never grows back
[22:38:16] <Sxem> i dont believe it tho
[22:38:18] <Matt|home> yeah no wonder the homework parser is marking me wrong
[22:38:23] <Matt|home> im leaving it in out of protest..
[22:38:51] <Sxem> i think the pros have high powered guns so they can charge you a fortune to get it done
[22:39:06] <Matt|home> Sxem : realistically there's no such thing as permanent hair removal that doesn't count as like the baldness gene or whatever
[22:39:10] <Matt|home> it grows back eventually 
[22:39:22] <Matt|home> that's why i don't bother with waxing
[22:39:48] <Sxem> The only treatment that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) describe as permanent is electrolysis. Another method of hair removal that provides long lasting results is laser hair removal.
[22:40:18] <JenniFurr> Yes, there are several different units available, regardless, do your homework on them first
[22:40:33] <DPA> So lazers, used like for tatoo removal. I assume think that would permanently scar the skin?
[22:40:43] <Sxem> so i buy the $50 laser gun, shoot myself every day for 6 months, and then do it again in a year?
[22:40:45] <JenniFurr> Not quite
[22:41:29] <JenniFurr> You need to do your research, and I'm not going to do it for you
[22:41:39] <Sxem> my pain tolerance is too low to tweeze
[22:42:56] <Sxem> In most cases, hair removal lasts several months, and in some cases it might last for years. When hair grows back, it‚Äôs often finer and lighter in color. However, laser hair removal doesn‚Äôt guarantee permanent hair removal.
[22:44:21] <Sxem> seems like cure for hair is worse than the disease
[22:44:33] <Sxem> may as well keep shaving
[22:44:58] <Sxem> id like to try electrolysis for my neck and cheeks, but its too expensive
[22:45:13] <Sxem> i will never want to grow a neck beard
[22:45:19] <Sxem> and my cheeks have a bald spot
[22:45:19] <JenniFurr> There's also creams for this as well
[22:45:33] <Sxem> so i will never grow a cheek beard
[22:45:49] <DPA> THe first site I found says electrolysis can take anywhere between 8 months up to 3 years. That takes too long.
[22:46:24] <Sxem> ideally, id get rid of nose hair close to the exit bcs it grows out of my nose, and ear hair
[22:46:31] <Sxem> i get long ear and nose hairs now
[22:47:20] <JenniFurr> I suggest you do at least a few days of research, before you start making conclusions, k?

[23:19:06] <MootPoot> keeping upto date on security issues, knowing how to handle networking for thousands of clients, server performance , etc etc
[23:19:06] <emmeka> requiring infrastructure, or paying for it
[23:19:17] <Berlin36> yes 
[23:19:21] <MootPoot> its only easy if you dont think about it
[23:19:26] <Berlin36> oh alright
[23:19:27] <Berlin36> i see
[23:19:42] <Berlin36> i meant a server more for a group of max 100 people

[23:20:30] <Berlin36> wh-
[23:21:17] <Berlin36> an odd question to ask, but do server admins know how to code ? or do they do it on a daily basis?
[23:21:25] <MootPoot> yes/no
[23:21:31] <emmeka> I don't think it's strictly required
[23:21:40] <MootPoot> kind of is, but isent as well
[23:21:46] <MootPoot> they dont need to know how to code
[23:21:59] <MootPoot> but they do need to typically be good at scripting / bash etc

[23:22:08] <Berlin36> oh
[23:22:17] <MootPoot> which is a similar level of skill to do well imo
[23:22:23] <Berlin36> yes
[23:22:48] <Berlin36> i think administrating servers is very hard lol
[23:22:55] <Berlin36> there's a lot to learn
[23:23:41] <MootPoot> if you need your own server- its typically always better unless you REALLY know what you're doing to just pay the extra $$$ and get a premade / managed image spun up 
[23:24:00] <Berlin36> oh
[23:24:23] <MootPoot> if you wanted a minecraft server, just get straight minecraft server hosting pre setup for you rather then renting an empty server and doing it all yourself

[23:36:34] <Berlin36> and then how do servers host something?
[23:36:44] <Berlin36> they have open ports too, don't they?
[23:36:59] <MootPoot> yes, but they have enterprise grade firewalls
[23:37:07] <Berlin36> MootPoot, nothing really, the gate is still closed :D
[23:37:15] <Berlin36> right
[23:37:18] <MootPoot> and entire teams of people managing and constantly watching
[23:37:36] <Berlin36> minecraft servers..?
[23:37:43] <MootPoot> any server
[23:37:49] <Berlin36> i understand like massive fucking servers
[23:37:55] <Berlin36> like hypixel or whatever
[23:37:55] <MootPoot> any server
[23:37:58] <Berlin36> huh
[23:38:01] <emmeka> Berlin36 yes, don't do this. I was wondering how exactly you managed this. Now I understand, but what you did is really insecure.
[23:38:08] <Berlin36> i see
[23:38:14] <MootPoot> any server that is a paid service for lots of people
[23:38:15] <dweltstorm> MootPoot: if i left my front door open the pizza guy could deliver without me being there
[23:38:19] <Berlin36> it wasn't supposed to be used on a daily basis tbh
[23:38:27] <Berlin36> more of an experiment
[23:38:36] <MootPoot> dweltstorm: pizza guy could call his friends and steal your TV  as well during his delivery
[23:38:40] <Berlin36> what if i don't have mone?
[23:38:47] <ButterNoodle> watch out.. if u shut ur front door someone may kick in ur back door
[23:39:02] <dweltstorm> MootPoot: my pizza guys cool
[23:39:03] <Berlin36> you can't really host anything if you don't have mone(((999

[23:39:17] <Berlin36> yooo analoq 
[23:39:24] <Berlin36> rip dweltstorm
[23:39:27] <analoq> if there is nothing listening on that port then it's basically dead
[23:39:53] <Berlin36> btw
[23:39:57] <ButterNoodle> a bridge to nowhere
[23:40:04] <Berlin36> today i setuped a basic server client connection in golang
[23:40:12] <MootPoot> it *might* be fine if you go the pseudo WAN method - hamachi 
[23:40:13] <analoq> you need a vulnerability on the service that is attached to the port to have a problem
[23:40:21] <MootPoot> but I dont know 100% on that
[23:40:22] <Berlin36> you can connect to the server and enter some text, and the server will return the text in caps

[23:41:10] <Berlin36> yo dweltstorm 
[23:41:16] <dweltstorm> my compute crashed out of nowhere
[23:41:17] <DPA> I have a mail, web, etc. Server on my attic. It's a regular PC. There is no need for an "enterprise grade firewalls". They are usually almost useless anyway.
[23:41:19] <analoq> the biggest threat imho is to have a minecraft server running and listening to its default port, because as soon as someone gets wind of a vulnerability they are all targets
[23:41:24] <Berlin36> i thought the pizza guy killed you because of the opened door
[23:41:38] <dweltstorm> to continute my joke, my pizza guy is cool, he would ask me before inviting his friends
[23:41:49] <dweltstorm> id ask him to bring a bit of extra pizza
[23:41:52] <dweltstorm> and we could have a party
[23:41:56] <Berlin36> lul
[23:41:57] <Berlin36> nice
[23:42:00] <dweltstorm> many benefits to leaving your door open
[23:42:04] <Berlin36> ye
[23:42:29] <DPA> To keep a server safe, the minimal thing needed is to update everything regularly, ideally daily & automatically.
[23:42:41] <analoq> +1
[23:42:42] <Berlin36> understood
[23:43:04] <Berlin36> i love this channel :)
[23:43:18] <MootPoot> all the network hardware along the way...
[23:43:19] <analoq> the next thing being to never trust one thing to safeguard you. but that is already difficult to implement

[23:43:45] * MootPoot remembers all the vulnerable home consumer routers..
[23:43:54] <Berlin36> servers seem confusing to me tho
[23:44:07] <DPA> Segregating things can help too. You can put the server into a VM or container, and set up a firewall on the host to only allow traffic from and to the internet, for example. Makes a breach less bad.
[23:44:10] <dweltstorm> i know nothing about networking lol
[23:44:11] <analoq> it's just a computer :|
[23:44:18] <Berlin36> as i said, i coded a basic tcp server and a client today in Go
[23:44:27] <dweltstorm> i followed a tutorial for making a chat client and thats it
[23:44:54] <Berlin36> in c#?
[23:44:58] <dweltstorm> python
[23:45:01] <Berlin36> oh nice
[23:45:06] <Berlin36> what library did you use
[23:45:11] <dweltstorm> socket
[23:45:24] <Berlin36> oh yeah
[23:45:34] <dweltstorm> is it possible to send files here
[23:45:42] <Berlin36> well yes but actually no
[23:45:49] <Berlin36> you can send links to files
[23:46:13] <analoq> dweltstorm: here as in 'in this chatroom'?
[23:46:18] <dweltstorm> yes
[23:46:23] <Berlin36> oh
[23:46:28] <analoq> there is ddc
[23:46:41] <Berlin36> what's ddc
[23:46:49] <analoq> dcc*
[23:46:49] <dweltstorm> im using a weird irc with not many features
[23:46:57] <dweltstorm> i remember you could send files with xchat
[23:47:04] <Berlin36> irc's just text
[23:47:13] <analoq> direct client to client
[23:47:22] <analoq> you can send files with it
