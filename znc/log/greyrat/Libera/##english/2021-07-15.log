[00:06:48] <bin> blkshp: how so
[00:06:54] <TimMc> blkshp: What language is this?
[00:07:11] <blkshp> English, north style
[00:08:01] <bin> this guy is funny lol
[00:08:07] <bin> "oh there's been a bit of a domestic" hahaha
[00:08:19] <blkshp> Shame he basically disappeared.
[00:08:30] <bin> "this is the show, I do two hours of this then go off" LOL
[00:08:40] <bin> some of the closed captions are incorrect
[00:08:49] <bin> "That's a belter, that" became "that's a belt of that"
[00:08:58] <bin> I reckon they're generated
[00:09:25] <blkshp> Teletext. Picked it packed it fucked off
[00:10:07] <blkshp> It's the north, YT can't do north. Lots of planets have a north!
[00:10:14] <TimMc> Oh yeah, YT's autogenerated captions here are... shite, would it be? :-)
[00:10:14] <bin> "strap yourself in for 20 minutes fo comedy stretched over a two hour show" hahaha
[00:10:16] <bin> he's so honest
[00:10:45] <bin> I'm hard of hearing in genneral in the vocal range but his accent isn't TOO difficult
[00:12:24] <bin> blkshp: what does "throw a sickie" meann?
[00:12:32] <bin> why is my n key double-triggering 
[00:12:41] <blkshp> Call in sick when you're not sick
[00:13:12] <bin> ahhh
[00:13:30] <bin> he's totally right about this btw
[00:13:33] <bin> plant the seed the day before

[00:55:56] <CuriosTiger> No. The two words are indeed frequently used together.
[00:56:14] <CuriosTiger> Logically, you would think that doesn't make sense, but that is nevertheless the common usage.
[01:10:29] <mdogg> That's a good question, tarsier.  And I have to agree wtih CuriosTiger in that I've never heard or seen the word "adage" used without the world "old" preceeding it.  I've never thought about that before until now..
[01:10:58] <CuriosTiger> I've seen it both ways, but "old adage" is by far the more common usage.
[01:11:17] <mdogg> Yeah - that's the only way I have ever seen it used..

[02:45:52] <LjL> however i suspect saying it the "wrong" way may be fairly common
[02:47:23] <mdogg> You could separate it.  For example, "Would you mind telling me; how long does it take to get to Seattle?"  But you could also just say, "How long does it take to get to Seattle?"
[02:48:04] <tinwhiskers> LjL: oh, congrats on the win *sigh*
[02:48:49] <mdogg> Actually, the win goes to tinwhiskers for answering directly.  "...how long it takes..." is the correct answer overall.

[05:46:16] <Samian> hi
[05:46:47] <Samian> My old boss keeps forwarding junk mail sent to my old company email. How can I tell him to stop?
[05:47:08] <Samian> "Hi Joe. It looks like junk mail. You don't need to forward it to me." ?
[05:47:19] <twb> Samian: do you ever get legitimate mail from that person?
[05:47:40] <Samian> it's semi legit
[05:47:48] <Samian> the last email reads "I’m on the selection committee for the Forbes Technology Council, a group for experienced technology executives and leaders.  I think you might be a good fit for membership. Could we schedule a call to discuss your qualifications?"
[05:47:52] <Samian> it's from forbes.com
[05:48:08] <mdogg> There should be an "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email.
[05:48:14] <Samian> I doubt Forbes singled me out though
[05:48:33] <mdogg> Just unsubscribe so they remove your email address.
[05:48:56] <twb> mdogg: is a *human* forwarding email to you?
[05:49:11] <twb> er, Samian
[05:49:19] <Samian> yes
[05:49:27] <Samian> human is forwarding me the emails
[05:51:19] <twb> Samian: does this human ever send you email that you DO want to read?
[05:51:37] <Samian> so far no
[05:51:51] <twb> Then just mark is as spam and forget about it
[05:53:03] <Samian> good idea
[05:53:35] <Samian> I wasn't sure if it would be rude to not email back at all. like email "thank for forwarding the email." or "Got it but don't need it"
[05:53:47] <mdogg> Then just tell him, "Please discontinue forwarding emails like this to me.  I have decided to subscribe to emails of interest myself."
[05:54:16] <Samian> woah you are good with words!
[05:54:47] <Samian> "Thanks Joe. You can discontinue forwarding emails like this."
[05:55:02] <mdogg> There you go.  
[05:55:36] <mdogg> "I appreciate your help."
[05:55:56] <Samian> darn I already pressed the send button
[05:56:04] <Samian> I appreciate your help was a nice touch I could have added!
[05:56:05] <mdogg> It's all good. 
[05:56:16] <mdogg> Do you see him in person?
[05:56:24] <Samian> we're on good terms
[05:56:36] <Samian> He's the ceo of a company I worked for for about 10 years
[05:56:43] <mdogg> If you see him in person or speak with him, you can let him know that you appreciated his effort.
[05:56:53] <Samian> good idea!
[05:56:54] <mdogg> Or if he replies.
[05:57:03] <Samian> thanks mdogg !
[05:57:13] <mdogg> I'm glad I could help.
[05:57:59] <Samian> I never had a good dad or social coach to help me become proficient in human interaction and daily communication
[05:59:14] <mdogg> I didn't learn how to write from my dad or a social coach.  I learned it from reading.  So you'll be ok.
[06:01:10] <twb> mdogg: I think they meant more like "it's bad to steal a car radio, but it's OK to steal from your employee's pension fund"

[12:16:41] <GuiToris> Hello, I was wondering if both sentences are correct and natural: Before they left the house, they had carefully closed all the windows and had locked the front door. Before the house was left, all the windows had been carefully closed and the front door had been locked.
[12:22:37] <TechTest> "...the windows *have* been carefully closed..."
[12:23:02] <TechTest> the first one though sounds a bit better to me

[12:29:32] <GuiToris> why do you think present perfect is better than past perfect? :/
[12:29:44] <GuiToris> I believe you need to shift one tense back
[12:29:56] <GuiToris> present - > past; past - > past perfect
[12:30:05] <blkshp> Before they left the house, they carefully closed all the windows and locked the front door
[12:30:34] <GuiToris> blkshp, no perfect at all?! :O
[12:30:51] <blkshp> The "had" in that sentence just sounds stupid.,
[12:31:45] <GuiToris> would you remove 'hads'  from the passive sentence too?
[12:32:03] <GuiToris> Before the house was left, all the windows were carefully closed and the front door was locked.
[12:32:06] <twb> John, while James had had "had", had had "had had".
[12:32:23] <blkshp> take out the last 'was' too
[12:32:49] <GuiToris> ... and the front door locked???????? :O

[12:35:40] <GuiToris> I owe you a bottle of ale
[12:35:43] <blkshp> and GuiToris the "how can trust" line, horrible,

[12:38:10] <blkshp> whom* s/the//
[12:39:12] <GuiToris> i think you are exaggerating
[12:39:24] <blkshp> Why?
[12:39:34] <blkshp> and Englishman is one word.
[12:39:43] <GuiToris> 'whom' is even more British than you are
[12:40:04] <GuiToris> and it's transitive, isn't it?!
[12:40:28] <GuiToris> 'whom did you beat yesterday'
[12:40:45] <blkshp> I don't bloody know but whom is correct in that sentence.
[12:41:06] <blkshp> Most people don't use whom these days and that's ok, jsut don't get it wrong the other wayt.
[12:41:08] <blkshp> way*
[12:41:28] <GuiToris> ok, 2 bottles of ale then
[12:41:34] <blkshp> Think of it this way, if the answer could be "him" - whom. If the answer can be "he" - who.
[12:41:43] <pussipupu> whom where it would be him
[12:41:50] <pussipupu> yes that
[12:41:51] <twb> blkshp: so subject vs. object?
[12:42:08] <blkshp> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[12:42:12] <twb> "He bit him" "who bit whom?"

[13:35:28] <GuiToris> beside that, do you like both sentences?
[13:36:00] <blkshp> on the question, as you're asking someone... "...before you left the house?" would be preferred. and on the negative, "The windows weren't closed and the front door wasn't locked before the house was left"
[13:36:26] <blkshp> But what I may do is reverse the thing...
[13:37:04] <blkshp> The windows were left open and the door unlocked when they/we/I left the house.
[13:37:26] <blkshp> BEcause on your negative, the windows were open but the front door was locked.
[13:37:39] <GuiToris> interesting, you made me remove 'was' a few minutes ago (the front door was locked)
[13:38:01] <blkshp> Yes, because the states were positive.

[19:25:21] <TimMc> bin: Well, first off, the 50 µg dose apparently confers basically the same immunity as the 100 µg dose. So using half-doses would allow stretching the supply.
[19:27:39] <TimMc> And I can't dig up a reference at the moment, but I believe there's reduced side-effects from the half-dose.
[19:28:44] <TimMc> (They're going to be using 50 µg for children since kids tend to have a stronger immune reaction; it may be that they should really get 25µg and elderly people get 100 µg...)
[19:33:04] *** Parts: Mikro (leo@the.punkrock.show) (Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[19:35:27] <CuriosTiger> <TimMc>	bin: Well, first off, the 50 µg dose apparently confers basically the same immunity as the 100 µg dose. So using half-doses would allow stretching the supply. <-- I've heard this proffered as a hypothesis, but has it been proven?
[19:36:27] <bin> TimMc: except you said "mRNA vaccines", plural.
[19:36:50] <bin> when you're really just referring to the Moderna one.
[19:38:00] <TimMc> bin: Oh, fair. I guess I really only have seen things to back that hypothesis for Moderna.
[19:38:12] <TimMc> I think the side effect rates are about the same, though?
[19:39:37] <bin> The side effects vary wildly depending on the individual for every current covid vaccine with the majority of symptoms being sore arm, tiredness, minor aches & pains
[19:39:51] <bin> The side effects for Moderna are SLIGHTLY more than Pfizer because of the larger dose
[19:40:23] <bin> but again, depends on the individual. Everyone I know who got Moderna was over 50 and had minimal side effects. I had Pfizer (I'm under 50) and had very minimal side effects, almost none the second shot. Only a sore arm.
[19:40:27] <CuriosTiger> I've been getting the impression that Moderna and Pfizer are similar in efficacy and side effects, whereas other vaccines diverge more from those two. But that observation is distinctly un-scientific and anecdotal.
[19:40:36] <bin> I know a few people who got Pfizer (under 50) and were wrecked from like mild flu-like symptoms
[19:40:41] <bin> so it just depends on the individual really
[19:40:47] <CuriosTiger> I got Moderna and I had relatively mild side effects, even though I'm under 50
[19:41:07] <bin> Like my mom was a bit whooped, but she wasn't in a horrific state, same for my in-laws.
[19:41:12] <CuriosTiger> but I also know people who got both Pfizer and Moderna who had pretty severe side effects
[19:41:24] <CuriosTiger> not permanent ones, but the "sick as a dog" side effect for as long as a week
[19:41:46] <CuriosTiger> Personally, I had some soreness at the injection site, a bit more than with other vaccines, and some mild fatigue
[19:42:02] <CuriosTiger> after the second shot, I had joint aches on day 2, but they went away again a day later. And they were mild.
[19:42:02] <TimMc> bin: Well sure it depends on the individual, I understand that.
[19:42:17] <bin> I had very mild fatigue and feeling out of it after the first shot, but only arm pain after the second one
[19:42:31] <CuriosTiger> bin: You received Moderna?
[19:42:49] <TimMc> I had an inflamed deltoid after both doses of Moderna. Nothing systemic.
[19:43:29] <CuriosTiger> My arm did feel more sore than I'm used to from other vaccines. But that got better in a couple of days.
[19:44:33] <bin> CuriosTiger: no Pfizer
[19:44:42] <CuriosTiger> Ah.
[19:44:47] <bin> my mom, step-dad, and in-laws all got Moderna
[19:44:58] <bin> Myself, my husband, my sister and her husband all got Pfizer
[19:45:01] <CuriosTiger> Is it random there or age-based?
[19:45:06] <bin> Really I got what was available on the day I had my appointment
[19:45:13] <CuriosTiger> Makes sense.
[19:45:37] <CuriosTiger> Same here. Florida got a lot of Moderna early on. Later, around April we started getting large Pfizer shipments.
[19:45:44] <bin> It's weird how it works in different states
[19:45:51] <bin> yeah I think that's how it's been in our areas too
[19:45:56] <bin> We're spread out. NY, VA, TX
[19:46:11] <TimMc> The tiny amount of stats presented in this article would indicate about twice the side-effect rate in Moderna as Pfizer: https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/pfizer-vs-moderna-vaccines-does-one-have-more-side-effects-than-the-other/2373414/
[19:46:12] <bin> what's interesting about TX is that each county is doing something differennt
[19:46:20] <CuriosTiger> I got the first vaccine in March, which was ahead of general availability for my age group (I have severe asthma.)
[19:46:24] <bin> TimMc: that makes sense tbh considering the dosage is like 2x
[19:46:28] <TimMc> ...but it only mentions fatigue and headache
[19:46:45] <CuriosTiger> A friend of mine built the queuing system for Washington County, Texas.
[19:47:03] <bin> CuriosTiger: nice, I got mine in March and April as well. Husband is in education and I'm overweight and have severe allergies that put me on asthma medication so I guess we got prioritized 
[19:47:12] <bin> ha that's cool
[19:47:37] <CuriosTiger> I needed a Florida-specific form and a letter explaining my medical condition, both issued by my physician.
[19:48:06] <bin> interesting
[19:48:06] <CuriosTiger> We had some early scandals with rich people purchasing early access to the vaccine. After that, getting prioritized required documentation from a licensed MD.
[19:48:13] <bin> yeah I read about that
[19:48:20] <bin> disappointing but unsurprising
[19:48:27] <CuriosTiger> Yeah. Very Florida, I'm sad to say.
[19:48:37] <bin> yep
[19:48:38] <CuriosTiger> We have some incredibly entitled people in this state.
[19:48:46] <LuisP14> :x
[19:48:51] <bin> sadly there are people like that in every state
[19:48:55] <bin> it was an issue in NY and TX as well
[19:48:59] <CuriosTiger> Indeed.
[19:49:03] <bin> it might've been more widespread in FL though 
[19:49:10] <TimMc> This has more quantification and notes on sample size, skew, and reporting bias: https://safelyhq.medium.com/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects-showdown-pfizer-vs-moderna-c621b258f01c
[19:49:11] <bin> probably due to the entitled people fleeing from NY to FL
[19:49:16] <CuriosTiger> Well, the epicenter of it was Boca and West Palm
[19:49:20] <bin> yeah
[19:49:27] <bin> where my fam is lol
[19:49:28] <CuriosTiger> A lot of the people involved moved to Florida FROM New York
[19:49:34] <bin> fortunately they're not that kind of people though
[19:49:38] <CuriosTiger> That's good.
