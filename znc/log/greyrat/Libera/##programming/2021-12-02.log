[06:13:23] <vdamewood> The only thing I can think of that I like abou BSD over Linux is that the whole system is maintained as a single project.
[06:13:40] <arahael> ircuser: It's probably because linux is a disarganised, chaotic mess, whereas yeah, that ^^ BSD is maintained as a wholistic, single project.
[06:14:08] <vdamewood> Though there are multiple BSD projects, they each are a complete, single project.

[08:07:27] <InPhase> I personally do not like the philosophy of TDD at all.  But I see cases where it is helpful.  They just happen to be cases that I think are pretty easy to get right anyway, perhaps with just a little ad-hoc testing here and there.

[08:11:34] <karstensrage> i feel like TDD is good if you dont fully understand the domain, but then once you do it becomes an impediment

[08:27:16] <oldlaptop> You have the added problem that your software is not wholly responsible for things like "no jitter on smooth motions" (in a way that informally "feels different" than the way those rocket engineers aren't responsible for not allowing someone to riddle the rocket with machine gun fire, or something - for one thing rocket engineers can and do design rockets that are unlikely to blow up when misused/abused in such ways)

[08:34:10] <gambl0re> InPhase: so basically a binary tree is unsorted, binary search tree is sorted
[08:34:26] <oldlaptop> "binary tree" implies nothing in particular about the ordering
[08:34:36] <InPhase> gambl0re: More precisely, saying "binary tree" does not say if it's sorted or not.

[10:51:46] <mrig> DarkTrick nice, I think the stack needs simplifying.
[10:51:48] <DarkTrick> flakland, problem with the doc: too broad -> doesn't help; too detailed -> a jungle
[10:51:50] <flakland> i think i would merge "GTK / FileManager / Desktop Env" in that one list
[10:52:20] <DarkTrick> mrig, thank you; stack?
[10:52:35] *** Quits: jazzy3 (~jaziz@user/jaziz) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[10:53:21] <DarkTrick> flakland, why so? 
[10:53:40] <flakland> the biggest problem with docs i see is they never point you to the source files needed to read for a specific topic
[10:53:59] <mrig> flakland is than not just adding to the top of something that is already very complex, how would the documentation make it easier to navigate?
[10:54:07] <flakland> because they're pretty much the same thing, under the dexktop env umbrella
[10:55:04] <mrig> DarkTrick the dependence upon so much a priory.
[10:55:16] <mrig> It is currently at the insane level.
[10:55:21] <DarkTrick> flakland, @ docs: indeed. basically what I was trying to say. ( I remember getting lost in libreoffice  (without any human support))
[10:55:54] <mrig> The desktop is supposed to be something that you lean on to write, not that you have to prop up and hold whilst you are working.
[10:56:22] <mrig> Some greatly prefer writing to reading too.
[10:56:30] <DarkTrick> mrig, speaking from my heart!
[10:56:53] <mrig> you can not force those people to 'be like this' just because you are.
[10:57:18] <mrig> That is the sign of a closed mind and does not bode well for foresight.
[10:57:36] <flakland> i'm currently fumbling my way around gcc trying to get struct component_ref working. for some reason it  is causing an assertion, if the docs included a list of conditions that must be met for combinations of expressions and operators, etc, i might have a clue as to how to fix it
[10:58:09] <flakland> but now my only prospects seem to be adding debug info to other languages to see what their exact tree layouts are for operators on struct componenta-refs
[11:00:15] <mrig> It could be that docs in a slightly different format, upon a slightly simpler stack would introduce those 'writers' to the climate a little more gradually; I don't know, it is a difficult problem.

[11:04:54] <mrig> I think perhaps, that if there was a simpler underlying protocol it would be easier to navigate; Which does not say anything about the way that they are written, more so the format.

[12:39:40] <pyzozord> it doesn't matter if gc collected the old nodes in the deque or not, we should never count garbage memory into space complexity
[12:41:00] <deniska> pyzozord: I mean, when asking O(something) questions, it's important to consider what we care about
[12:41:16] <deniska> pyzozord: this code does have a linear memory growth until we hit 3 elements :)
[12:41:45] <pyzozord> I assumed the industry default for complexity questions is that we say O but we mean theta and we are talking strictly about theoretical requirements of the algorithm itself

[12:42:40] <Homework> Hello.
[12:42:45] <deniska> pyzozord: I mean, if we ever only have up to 3 elements, and each element is big enough that we care about its memory allocation, then yeah, we'd say it's O(n) on the number of elements
[12:43:06] <Square> What are the major platform agnostic development platforms today? Java, Electron and Chromium Embedded Framework are all i know of. 
[12:43:24] <deniska> big-O as used in programming is more of a "you know it when you see it" kind of situation
[12:43:28] <pyzozord> I'm asking because I got into a discussio about my AoC solution, someone claiming that garbage memory from gc must be included in space complexity therefore my the above code is O(n) space

[12:48:28] <deniska> pyzozord: if we take GC pressure into consideration (and cpython uses reference counting for that, which many people don't even consider a GC), then we should also take cache locality and all other underlying machine specifics
[12:48:50] <pyzozord> no_gravity: you can do it, you need js on the top frame and the iframe that communicate with each other. Iframe js sends to top frame js the height of it's document, top frame receives that info and resizes the iframe. I did it before. It's not instant, but it works
[12:48:56] <deniska> pyzozord: which also might be an important consideration, but it's typically a very different kind of consideration than just discussing big-O's of an algorithm

[12:49:58] <pyzozord> deniska: thanks, yes I think you confirmed what I thought in much better words
[12:50:41] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: nice thanks, yeah I should just empirically measure it. Need to get familira with the sys module anyway
[12:50:52] <deniska> pyzozord: at the end of the day, the only way to know a real big O of a real program is to measure it running with real data on real computers :)
[12:51:19] <pyzozord> i think then it's not even big o, it's just memory usage
[12:51:34] <GeDaMo> Homework: so you have to write a program which does this?
[12:51:35] <deniska> pyzozord: well, if memory usage depends on the input size, we can measure that big O
[12:52:12] <pyzozord> yeah i guess you can kind of guestimate the big-o from observing the input/memory usage ratios
[12:52:15] <Homework> GeDaMo, yes.
[12:52:52] <deniska> pyzozord: it's not a guesstimation, it's a real result if you measured it
[12:52:54] <GeDaMo> Homework: you'd probably want to get the size of the largest item to find the size of the column
[12:53:42] <GeDaMo> Then it's just a case of looping over the list printing "| " + item + padding + " |"
[12:53:47] <pyzozord> deniska: yeah I guess if you measure it precisely for each n then indeed it is :)
[12:53:48] <deniska> pyzozord: (well, if you want a nice concise answer which doesn't involve "look at this excel spreadsheet", you'll need to fit a curve to it, but some common curve will typically fit really well)
[12:54:08] <deniska> or sometimes multiple curves
[12:54:23] <deniska> with inflection point being "data stops fitting in a cache line" or something like this
[12:56:14] <pyzozord> i've did that kind of measurement once. created a struct and then an array of these structs. Then printed out time it took to iterate over the array. It was very fast, but second time my struct was much larger, and the time was several order of magnitudes slower. It was cool because I took the printouts and plotted them in excel

[13:46:03] <deniska> pyzozord: project euler is math which just happened to be simple to express as programs

[13:47:43] <pyzozord> deniska: yeah that's interesting
[13:48:05] <pyzozord> so far day 1 and day 2 my parts 1 were good enough to be only slightly modified to work for parts 2

"constant" is the constant version io.vavr.Function2#constant method. Foo#getFeedbackArgs() is just a getter that returns a feeback arg

[17:36:14] <pulse> You can say "someone knows the answer" that's correct I'm sure
[17:36:23] <vdamewood> pulse: If you phrase it like that, it implies surprise.
[17:36:24] <pulse> I guess in question form it requires a does
[17:36:24] <apotheon> The hidden "does" thing would result in "Anyone know?"
[17:36:32] <apotheon> same with "Someone"
[17:36:35] <vdamewood> pulse: Yeah, but we can also drop the does.
[17:36:40] <pulse> Yes but "Anyone know" sounds wrong somehow
[17:36:46] <bjs> pulse: not to me
[17:36:49] <pulse> Hmm
[17:36:51] <apotheon> . . . but ideally it would be "Does anyone know?" or "Does someone know?" . . .
[17:36:52] <vdamewood> So, "Does anyone know?" becomes "Anyone know?"
[17:37:23] <pulse> It makes sense, but it also doesn't
[17:37:24] <apotheon> Understand that dropping the "does" part is *extremely* informal.
[17:37:26] <pulse> Like most things in English :P
[17:37:37] <pulse> Like how you can mug a person's mug
[17:37:40] <vdamewood> ^ apotheon's right.
[17:38:01] <apotheon> Extremely informal speech is actually used somewhat often in vaguely formal circumstances, but pretty much not at all in formal writing.

[17:39:31] <apotheon> vdamewood: Well, sure, but I was assuming the less-weird case, because if pulse is mugging someone's coffee cup, pulse is taking its face.
[17:39:35] <vdamewood> My foobar! What have I started?

[17:39:48] <pyzozord> vdamewood: can you translate that Buffalo sentence to international english?
[17:39:49] <apotheon> vdamewood: At least with mugging someone's face, the thing one is taking is a separate object (the coffee cup).
[17:40:25] <pulse> Isn't the buffalo one the type that you can append `buffalo` to continually and it's still correct always
[17:40:33] <pyzozord> I assume it's american because of the word "buffalo"
[17:40:36] <pulse> Or does it need a specific amount of words to be correct
[17:41:11] <pyzozord> some words are captialized, I think that's those capitals are in strategic places and that is what makes it correct

[19:14:16] <pyzozord> damn you nice neighbors, why are you so nice. i cant max out my subwoofer with nice neighbors :(
[19:14:24] <[itchyjunk]> there is too much to learn, and too few brain cells
[19:14:29] <[itchyjunk]> how will this ever work out?
[19:14:41] <Raziel> "try to stop" more like "poor edge is begging for its life in the corner while you download chrome"
[19:15:22] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk] it's not that much the useful things you do need are really few

[19:16:28] <Raziel> and edge and chrome are the same damn shit anyway, at this point.
[19:16:51] <[itchyjunk]> Im using brave
[19:16:55] <edgar-rft> [itchyjunk]: try to find redundancies (new things that are in common with other things you already know), that reduces the number of things to remember
[19:16:57] <[itchyjunk]> firefox keep doing weird shit
[19:17:06] <[itchyjunk]> edgar-rft, i did do that
[19:17:14] <[itchyjunk]> but the issue was, it ended up being harder things
[19:17:26] <[itchyjunk]> like type theory is in the internsection of a few different things i want to learn
[19:17:33] <Raziel> I dunno, every time I've tried chromium based stuff (mostly chrome itself) it's been a pain in the ass. always just went back to firefox. 's not perfect, but
[19:17:34] <[itchyjunk]> but type theory is harder starting point :(
[19:17:54] <[itchyjunk]> chromium felt a bit off
[19:18:13] <[itchyjunk]> chrome was okay but at one point, it got too slow and tracky
[19:18:26] <[itchyjunk]> i couldn't get rid of residual history showing up in search and such
[19:18:35] <[itchyjunk]> firefox was nice but it kept doing weird things
[19:18:42] <GeDaMo> You'll just have to write your own browser :P
[19:18:44] <[itchyjunk]> all tabs would crash because it decided to update 
[19:18:52] <[itchyjunk]> and nothing i did turned off this update feature
[19:19:06] <[itchyjunk]> i don't think writing my own browser solves the issue either
[19:19:12] <Raziel> you can try ESR, for less updates/more stability purposes
[19:19:21] <[itchyjunk]> whats ESR?
[19:19:24] <Raziel> but yeah, I have had that happen too. but then I just refreshed them
[19:19:27] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk] oh one more idea check our chrome extension api, maybe you can just write an extension for what you want, they are very east to write in js
[19:19:27] <[itchyjunk]> i tried edge and it was kinda fast and nice
[19:19:36] <[itchyjunk]> but i didn't have options to get no script running.
[19:19:39] <Raziel> firefox esr is the extended support release
[19:19:48] <[itchyjunk]> i thought because it was chromium powererd, no script would work
[19:20:03] <[itchyjunk]> oh extensions are just js?
[19:20:08] <pyzozord> ye
[19:20:10] <[itchyjunk]> maybe learning js isn't the worst idea then
[19:20:34] <pyzozord> there is nothing to learn. you can learn most of js in one hour
[19:21:11] <pyzozord> there is some trickiness with the prototypal object model but you can kind of just wing it
[19:21:18] <[itchyjunk]> sounds hard to believe
[19:21:25] <GeDaMo> I don't really know JS but I've managed to write a couple of Greasemonkey scripts with a bit of trial and error
[19:21:33] <[itchyjunk]> it will have t owait till end of semester though
[19:21:36] <pyzozord> ^
[19:21:44] <nomagno> My favorite use of JS is "DOM trigger oriented programming"
[19:21:46] <[itchyjunk]> oh i remember grease monkey from long time ago
[19:21:57] <nomagno> You... Use it as triggers for DOM element actions
[19:22:00] <nomagno> Duh
[19:22:21] <nomagno> Its a very primitive use, but it's what I need most

[22:30:37] <[itchyjunk]> like I said, a lot of people who can code would do poorly in this class :D
[22:30:45] <[itchyjunk]> if not outright give up and never complete it
[22:31:08] <Raziel> yeah but a lot of people who can code probably make more cash than the professor for this class
[22:31:15] <Raziel> so at least there's that
[22:31:23] <Raziel> :^)
[22:31:30] <[itchyjunk]> he probably makes tons consulting
[22:31:43] <[itchyjunk]> a lot of professors generally do it for fun in CS I've notied
[22:31:54] <[itchyjunk]> they generally have lucritive consulting side gig
[22:32:06] <[itchyjunk]> this one has a phd and such I know
[22:32:12] <CalimeroTeknik> ah, automatic grading.
[22:32:26] <CalimeroTeknik> funny that you didn't notice the "on"
[22:32:27] <[itchyjunk]> yeah we use gradescope
[22:32:31] <[itchyjunk]> I think it's "AI"
[22:32:40] <[itchyjunk]> I didn't notice it after going word per word
[22:32:48] <CalimeroTeknik> use meld
[22:32:54] <CalimeroTeknik> it's a difftool
[22:32:56] <[itchyjunk]> the class uses gradescope

[22:33:18] <oldlaptop> meld is not an alternative to gradescope, or to peanut butter, or to duct tape
[22:33:28] <CalimeroTeknik> meld is a difftool
[22:33:31] <[itchyjunk]> how does the editor change thing?
[22:33:38] <[itchyjunk]> we use eclipse
[22:33:45] <oldlaptop> meld is also not an editor!
[22:33:49] <Raziel> [itchyjunk], he means if you had put your output and the expected output from there in a difftool, you would've seen the missing "on"

[22:51:39] <oldlaptop> There are reasons you probably shouldn't, but it works.
[22:52:21] <oldlaptop> There are definitely reasons you shouldn't use ``, among which that you have to quote any kind of substitution in Bourne-ish shells in general, and "`foo`" looks horrible

[23:00:09] <oldlaptop> You need to quote it, but it's easier to read "$(foo)" than "`foo`".
[23:02:32] <pyzozord> can't just <args>, need to echo <args> or something like that
[23:05:00] <oldlaptop> and using xargs is generally a bad smell
[23:06:44] <oldlaptop> there is, again, no reason you can't do something like $(foo) arg1 arg2 ...
[23:07:09] <oldlaptop> the shell doesn't care whether the substitution is in the command name or not
