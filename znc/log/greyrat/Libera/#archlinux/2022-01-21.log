[01:52:10] <Earnestly> BrainDamage: I made this ages ago: https://0x0.st/osyC.txt

[01:53:04] <jaawerth> I'm sure I just need to spend some time properly reading about the basis of the syntax, not unlike back when I was like "you know maybe I should actually learn awk like a programming language and not just a thing I throw text at with brackets around it." I'm already more expressive with it than I was. not 
[01:53:22] <Earnestly> jaawerth: I also tried ndb, but meh.  I couldn't get the relations I wanted
[01:53:45] <Earnestly> jaawerth: With jq, I find the best resource of learning to be: https://github.com/stedolan/jq/blob/master/src/builtin.jq

[01:54:10] <Earnestly> Because via the manual and this you can see how almost everything is implemented in terms of jq itself
[01:54:59] <Earnestly> BrainDamage: (Though I don't have a jq script to convert gron-like output back to json.  I like gron but it came too late for me and is fairly useless now)
[01:55:11] <jaawerth> next you'll tell me jq is self-hosted
[01:55:17] <Earnestly> jaawerth: Not quite :p
[01:55:46] <BrainDamage> Earnestly: yeah, it has little use if you're proficient with jq, I just don't use it often enough to warrant learning
[01:56:17] <BrainDamage> I have to interface with a multitude of data formats, and json is just one among many
[01:56:29] <Earnestly> Yeah in which case gron is very nice.  Also https://jmespath.org/ is nice too

[02:05:21] <jaawerth> took me  sec to realize (which is funny because I implemented the feature) but the fennel compiler has a flag to act as a module bundler for fnl/lua, so to take advantage of that, antifennel compiles itself to fennel so fennel can compile it and all its modules/depsback to a single lua file. hilariously roundaout, but it works

[12:52:55] <intjtlgl[m]> just a question I have been trying to get arch installed on my laptop for a while. It seems that after I installed via pacstrap /mnt and the packages. I may or may not have ran fstab-gen -U /mnt  >> /mnt/etc/fstab before trying to run arch-chroot /mnt. I have formatted the partitions a few times and when I enter arch-chroot /mnt it states /bin/bash not found. I have /mnt/usr/bin but there is no symlink to /mnt/bin. I tried creating it
[12:52:55] <intjtlgl[m]> via ln -s and it still says the same thing. Even though in ls -al /mnt/bin/bash it is there now. Is there something that I am missing. I have reinstalled arch a few times. I came upon this error recently. I had a already installed arch and I had a package list in a text file and used that with pacstrap and I was able to arch-chroot and fix the desktop. Any ideas?

[20:18:18] <wunit> voltages: well, it's not the applications that decide which pages get moved to swap, though - it's mostly the kernel that decides based on which pages are unused
[20:19:05] <wunit> but if memory runs full, the kernel will at some point have to start moving actively used pages out as well, which renders the system more and more unusable
[20:19:43] <wunit> so "memory is full" is a bad situation, and swap space won't help much, hence "Don't treat swap as 'emergency memory' please". :-)

[23:00:38] <demonicmaniac1> and sure hope they can shut up all trolls
[23:00:55] <demonicmaniac1> but to be sure as soon as av1 adoption reaches a certain point over h265 mpegla will rear its ugly head somehow
[23:01:05] <demonicmaniac1> they won't backdown without bullshit claims
[23:01:21] <Earnestly> demonicmaniac1: I think vp9 was able to demonstrate that trolls don't have to win
[23:01:24] <another|> I mean: Do you honestly think they are stupid?
[23:01:36] <Earnestly> So av1 should be able to propel itself from those gains
[23:02:00] <another|> from what I heard they had everything double checked by lawyers
[23:02:07] <demonicmaniac1> mpegla? yes. they sued the webhoster hosting youtube-dl website for leading to massive copyright infringement

[23:53:08] <magnus1> hey! so recently got a new laptop and installed arch on it. Was mostly working except for one thing: the wifi card was poorly supported by the kernel (5.16). The card was a mt9721, and i believe the driver was mainlined in 5.15, so quite new. Anyhow, the issue was that the driver wouldn't always probe (there is a bug on it at kernel.org) and the computer wouldn't come out of suspend, also due to
[23:53:10] <magnus1> the wifi driver not resuming properly. So i figured, meh, no way im gonna try fixing this .. so i went out a bought a new wifi card (intel ax200) for the laptop. Intel has always been quite well supported in the kernel (IMO).. but this was almost as bad as the mediatek card. It got detected, but not always. Rebooting back and forth gave different results. There are lots of threads about it on
[23:53:12] <magnus1> reddit (like https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/m99aaa/intelr_wifi_6_ax200_no_wlan_interface/) and arch forums. So i was kind of disappointed. There was some talks about booting into windows and disabling some kind of "fastboot" thing, but this card has never even been booted with windows. Since the laptop doesnt have ethernet, working wifi is kind of a big deal. Finally, I tried
[23:53:14] <magnus1> installing a different distro (Pop OS) and wifi works great. Every time. Now Im trying to figure out why it wont work with arch, but cant see why. I ensured arch uses the same wifi firmware version. I tried reverting to linux-lts (which is very close to what pop os uses). I compared kernel module parameters (for the iwl* drivers), but pop os seems to use all the defaults (some forum threads
[23:53:16] <magnus1> suggest disabling power savings etc,.. pop os does not). So im out of luck. I really want to use Arch because i dont like pop os (other than that wifi works...). Any ideas on what to do? Anyone have experience with Intel AX200 on 5.16.1 kernel?
