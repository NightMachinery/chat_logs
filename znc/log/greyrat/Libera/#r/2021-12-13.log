[17:46:49] <squid_game> I have a dataframe like this (m) https://paste.debian.net/1223237/ and would like to conditionally change the  motion row if the value is 1, then I'd like to replace the 1 with 3000. How can I do it?
[17:48:36] <h_m> have you tried something yet?
[17:50:24] <squid_game> I searched some examples, but they are for columns, and couldn't apply it in my case as the thing I want to change is in row that doesn't repeat all the time. I am new to R and couldn't find out what to use
[17:51:00] *** Joins: slyrus (~slyrus@192-184-223-165.static.sonic.net)
[17:52:25] <h_m> ok. what error did you get? i am sure you were very close to the actual solution
[17:55:53] <h_m> i think you could also read about subsetting in R. (e.g. ?"[" on the console)

[17:58:31] <squid_game> I know I can get motion rows with m[m$type == "motion"]  then I I should get the column information which is 4 on my case. I guess syntax should be something like this m[m$type == "motion", 4]
[17:59:44] <squid_game> then I don't know if I should use while loop to go through all elements or what package to use
[17:59:58] <squid_game> what would you use?
[18:01:51] <h_m>  m[m$type == "motion", 4] <- 100 will change the fourth column to 100 where type is motion.
[18:02:25] <h_m> also m$value[m$type == "motion"] <- 100 will do the same
[18:02:39] <squid_game> it will assign 100 for all the values, right?
[18:02:49] <squid_game> I'd like to assign 100 if the value is 0
[18:03:10] <squid_game> if(  m[m$type == "motion", 4] == 0 ), then  m[m$type == "motion", 4] <- 100
[18:03:15] <squid_game> how can I do it in R?
[18:03:44] <h_m> in that case m$type == "motion" & m$value == 0 is your condition
[18:04:06] <squid_game> thanks a lot, it was what I was looking for :)
[18:04:38] <h_m> kul
[18:05:11] <fendur> qewal
[18:07:33] <h_m> think i misled squid_game, should look at vectorization in R ...
[18:09:47] <squid_game> h_m, I do this m[m$type == "motion" & m$value == 1,  4] <- 3000 but doesn't change any value
[18:11:29] <h_m> yes, because there is no row with that condition on your example
[18:12:12] <fendur> which you can check by running the same line without the <- 3000 assignment
[18:12:14] <squid_game> I filter it with that the type should be motion, and the value column should be 1, and assign 3000 into the 4th column (value)
[18:13:41] <squid_game> right, there weren't matching condition. Otherwise, it works correctly
[18:13:44] <squid_game> thanks a lot for the help :)

[22:23:17] <Bayes> if it were a war, I wouldn't want to be on the R side :D
[22:25:03] <Bayes> I watched about... ~20 presentations of data analyses all made with R
[22:25:21] <Bayes> I noticed something that, of course, it super specific of the crew that was presenting (ie a single sample)
[22:26:18] <Bayes> more people using ggplot than base R plot; most of the people using R plots were showing pretty rough and ready plots, like stuff without labels and sometimes with poor or no choice of color
[22:27:00] <Bayes> the plots made with ggplot2 seemed to suggest that, overall, people spent a bit more time producing the plot
[22:27:12] <Bayes> as in... they were less rough and ready
[22:31:07] <h_m> seems to suggest that then the ggplot users have unlimited time to care that much about just a plot?
[22:32:02] <fendur> i don't see how it's an argument to not take R's side
[22:32:38] <mefistofeles> I feel like I'm missing some context :P

[22:33:47] <fendur> :-)
[22:34:17] <mefistofeles> fendur: but what are you talking about? what "war" or sides?
[22:34:17] <mefistofeles> xD
[22:34:18] <fendur> mefistofeles: velix made a comment hours ago
[22:34:28] <mefistofeles> ah I probably missed that one
[22:34:35] <fendur> i assumed bayes' response was to that. i might have been wrong.
[22:35:33] <velix> I wonder where they're using R in SPSS :-)
[22:35:47] <velix> Maybe they're just making SPSS a GUI for R now :-)
[22:36:03] <h_m> it could be a trick to keep paying customers using SPSS...
[22:36:38] <velix> h_m: I mean, it wouldn't be that wrong if they contribute new stuff.
[22:36:58] <velix> All the R plugins would boost SPSS so far in the future...
[22:37:19] <velix> All the R mapping (thematic maps) stuff would change SPSS world.
[22:37:34] <fendur> i don't know if it's that simple. IBM will have to support it all if they just plug all that in
[22:39:04] <mefistofeles> they don't have to contribute to R to ship it or use it. It's better if they do, of course
[22:40:02] <h_m> but the R interface to SPSS is not very new, is it? or is this something different?
[22:40:10] <velix> h_m: no, but it's integrated now.
[22:40:15] <velix> You don't need to install it seperatly.
[22:40:23] <h_m> ok
[22:40:27] <velix> Like Python in the beginning. It was a seperate package.
[22:40:44] <velix> Ah, you now can use R syntax in SPSS. Nice!
[22:40:55] <h_m> it is trying to protecting their bottomline.

[22:48:46] <h_m> it would be useful if this allows for a seamless data transfer between SPSS and R. 
[22:51:27] <Bayes> seems to suggest that then the ggplot users have unlimited time to care that much about just a plot? -> that's harsh

[22:53:42] *** Joins: Colombo (~jmoravec@uo-uod-staff-05.nat.otago.ac.nz)
[22:53:55] <Bayes> I don't know that having plots well labeled, with a helpful legend, a good use of spacing and margins, etc is caring too much
[22:54:35] <fendur> depends on the context i guess.
[22:54:35] <Bayes> communication is like half of science
[22:58:07] <h_m> I do graphs but graphic designers beautify them. so, if i am presenting i will make sure it is not sloppy thats all. i would not care about which colour...

[23:02:53] <h_m> oh, the only other thing that i care about for graph is that it still readable when printed in black/white
[23:06:47] *** Joins: mnl (~mnl@user/mnl)
[23:07:10] <fendur> we're more or less (and correctly so) forced to consider various types of color blindness
[23:13:17] <h_m> i have never considered it but i am sure the designers do. i tend to shy away from overly complex graphs since i may not even be the one presenting them
[23:13:57] <fendur> yeah. im thinking of choropleths, specifically where ranges of colors are pretty common
[23:16:33] <h_m> ok. we had some intern working on maps using tableau...next time i would advise them to think about color blindness. think they prolly used some default colors in tableau
[23:17:30] <fendur> hopefully tableau defaults to a reasonable color scheme now. but who knows
[23:18:50] <fendur> i mean, im sure someone does
[23:20:21] <h_m> ya
[23:20:47] <Colombo> there are people who talk about that
[23:21:27] <Colombo> scientist often consider these formulative graphs

[23:23:18] <Colombo> the graph is made of a particular style (barplot, lineplot), has described axis (if the person knows what they are doing) etc., but is not made for public presentations
[23:23:29] <Colombo> it is these kind of ugly visualization of data, often without showing the story
[23:24:37] <Colombo> thats why IMHO ggplot is so popular
[23:24:50] <Colombo> on surface, it is already prepared graph without having to modify anything
[23:25:07] *** Quits: slyrus_ (~slyrus@192-184-223-165.static.sonic.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:25:13] <Colombo> but IMHO that is not true at all and ggplot needs a lot of fiddling to make it presentable.
[23:25:30] *** Joins: slyrus (~slyrus@192-184-223-165.static.sonic.net)
[23:29:24] <Bayes> agreed, not a great fan of ggplot
[23:30:08] <Bayes> but I'm also a fan of being in charge of my visualization and fiddling with it enough until it communicates what I want to communicate as clearly as I find necessary
[23:30:21] <Colombo> yeah, but thats not what I am trying to say
[23:30:38] *** Quits: perrierjouet (~perrier-j@modemcable012.251-130-66.mc.videotron.ca) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[23:30:53] <Bayes> so really what I'd love is not an "autoplot" kind of library but a rather easy way to fiddle with stuff
[23:30:59] <Colombo> What I am trying to say is that ggplot just makes the formulaic plots nicer, sure, but you should not do formulaic plots in the first place
[23:31:17] <Bayes> wdym formulaic?
[23:31:22] <Colombo> one should think what they are trying to say and prepare plots accordingly
[23:31:40] <Bayes> ah ok that's true, not sure how that goes against ggplot but I agree
[23:32:03] <Colombo> to me, its a solution to problem that doesn't exist:P
[23:32:25] <Bayes> Im not a great fan of ggplot2, I do appreciate a few specific things
[23:32:46] <Bayes> for example I like that I can produce plots in log10 scales pretty easily, no fiddling at all
[23:33:43] <Bayes> I also like that multipane plots get the axis limits and breaks well aligned, no duplicate labels, etc, without much fiddling
[23:34:46] <Bayes> also that it removes unnecessary margin for labels that your plot don't have, e.g., title
[23:35:40] *** dbristow_ is now known as dbristow
[23:35:46] <Colombo> yeah, I don't just do classic plots too often
[23:36:14] <Colombo> *I just don't do...
[23:36:16] <fendur> i do. all the time
[23:36:49] <Bayes> same here
[23:37:23] <Bayes> it goes without saying that you can achieve the same with base R
[23:37:32] <Bayes> so it's a matter of convenience
[23:38:09] <Bayes> e.g., not having to compute the log10 values and labeling the ticks on the original scale by hand, formatting the digits, etc
[23:38:30] <Bayes> or not having to compute a decent axis range by hand when using
[23:38:44] <Bayes> when using layout to stitch multiple panes
[23:39:17] <Bayes> or not having to fiddle with mar oma omi by hand based on what plot elements you toggle on or off
