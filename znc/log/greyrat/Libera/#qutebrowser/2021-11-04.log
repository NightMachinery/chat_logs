[00:14:09] <pylbrecht> Hi, I'm currently reading through good first issues (label: easy) and most of them are quite old (probably due to low priority). Is it still a good idea to pick one of the older ones or should I focus on more recent issues?

[12:12:54] <chvp> getting things set up to get started was the part that took the longest for my recent PR
[12:13:03] <ninewise> main thing I can contribute here, is that this wouldn't just be for NixOS; as I understand it, nix flakes are similar to tox, but for everything, not just python
[12:13:24] <chvp> indeed, anyone with nix installed would be able to use it

[13:50:49] <u0> Hi. Is possible to turn off javascript for a specific site?
[14:06:38] <nimaje> yeah, the js setting supports urlpatterns and there is a default binding that toggles it, iirc it is   tsh
[14:08:28] <palbrecht> I just ran the whole test suite for the first time and get some e2e failures due to timeouts (`end2end.fixtures.testprocess.WaitForTimeout`). Is this a known issue or could my setup be broken?
[14:26:10] <The-Compiler> palbrecht: I'd expect it to run through, it does on the CI at least
[14:26:20] <The-Compiler> palbrecht: can you pastebin the output somewhere?

[14:32:40] <The-Compiler> ionen: bumping where?
[14:33:08] <ionen> on Gentoo, I maintain qutebrowser package there, and I added pytest-bdd to run its tests
[14:34:11] <The-Compiler> I bet that issue would break others using it too
[14:35:23] <The-Compiler> Not too happy with pytest-bdd maintenance if I'm honest, but I guess qutebrowser won't move away from it anytime soon either

[17:32:47] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: sorry for the late reply. Here's the pastebin (although cut off) https://paste.the-compiler.org/view/0a13a3ce
[17:33:58] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: there's also one assertion error in there, which could be caused by a dirty environment of some sort. I ctrl-c'd a few times, so that might be the cause.

[17:43:47] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: something went wrong when pasting into pastebin, I will create the log without color to fix that.
[17:43:51] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: no worries, IRC is more or less async :)
[17:44:23] <The-Compiler> yeah I've seen this before too, probably the coloring should be stripped somehow in those logs, but I kinda got used to reading them this way :D
[17:45:06] <pylbrecht> the weird thing is, when pasting this into the pastebin, it just stops inserting text at a certain color code. So the interesting pieces are actually missing.
[17:45:21] <The-Compiler> huh
[17:46:36] <The-Compiler> well from a first look it seems to be something with your PDF.js installation, though I'm not sure what
[17:46:58] <The-Compiler> what OS/distribution is this on?
[17:47:08] <pylbrecht> arch linux
[17:47:34] <The-Compiler> with community/pdfjs 2.11.338-1 then?
[17:48:49] <pylbrecht> let me check
[17:49:11] <pylbrecht> yes, exactly
[17:52:25] <pylbrecht> again without color https://paste.the-compiler.org/view/fe1561b3
[17:59:30] <The-Compiler> 15:19:56.612 DEBUG    js         shared:javascript_log_message:156 [qute://pdfjs/build/pdf.js:2358] Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '='
[17:59:32] <The-Compiler> weird
[17:59:37] <pylbrecht> ok, I lied. It's still with color, but without these weird characters.
[18:00:25] <The-Compiler> also what's your qt5-webengine version?
[18:04:01] <pylbrecht> how do I check that?
[18:04:21] <pylbrecht> ah, it's a package
[18:05:05] <pylbrecht> extra/qt5-webengine 5.15.7-1 (qt qt5)
[18:05:20] <pylbrecht> extra/python-pyqt5-webengine 5.15.5-1 (pyqt5)
[18:05:21] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: can't dig into this right now, but I opened https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/6806
[18:05:56] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: weirdly I can reproduce the PDF.js issues but not the tests/unit/browser/webengine/test_webenginedownloads.py::TestDataUrlWorkaround you have
[18:06:59] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: the unit test failure looks like it could come from a dirty environment. Is there a way to wipe my virtualenvs? Like caches, etc.
[18:07:02] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: no idea what's going wrong though, given that viewing PDFs in qutebrowser with PDF.js (ctrl+p in the download prompt) seems to work fine... does it for you?
[18:07:31] <pylbrecht> yes, ctrl+p works fine.
[18:07:54] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: hmmm, do you have a ~/Downloads/filename.pdf by any chance?
[18:08:27] <pylbrecht> no, does not exist.
[18:09:24] <pylbrecht> but the `assert equals failed   'pdf (1)'  'pdf'` looks suspiciously like something already exists in a place, where it should not
[18:10:10] <The-Compiler> yeah
[18:10:19] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: what about a ~/Downloads/qwe_download.pdf or just download.pdf?
[18:11:14] <pylbrecht> no dice :(
[18:13:52] <The-Compiler> hmm
[18:14:45] <The-Compiler> can you still try to move ~/Downloads away (or perhaps $XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR if that's customized) and see if that changes anything?
[18:15:40] <pylbrecht> sure, let me try that quickly. If not I can also search for the pdf files you mentioned on my whole system.
[18:16:41] <pylbrecht> that solved it actually.
[18:16:51] <pylbrecht> the unit test failure is gone, although the other three e2e failures are still there
[18:16:59] <pylbrecht> but you reproduced these, so I guess that's expected
[18:18:39] <The-Compiler> yeah, but I'd like to find the remaining one too :D
[18:19:02] <pylbrecht> yes, of course!
[18:19:08] <The-Compiler> so it's something in your ~/Downloads then, assuming you have $XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR unset
[18:21:24] <pylbrecht> do you have any more specific pointers than "something in your ~/Downloads" by any chance? I search for "*.pdf", but found nothing that looks like it belongs to qutebrowser
[18:21:46] <pylbrecht> ohhhh, except ~/Downloads/pdf
[18:22:20] <pylbrecht> ok, removing ~/Downloads/pdf solved it.
[18:23:49] <The-Compiler> fun :D

[18:27:47] <The-Compiler> Sorry for the trouble! This one is because Chromium always looks in ~/Downloads to add suffixes to duplicate filenames, and that used to be not configurable, so qutebrowser works around it (but doesn't for that test).
[18:27:58] <The-Compiler> Too many moving parts sometimes unfortunately :-/

[18:30:21] <pylbrecht> exactly, that's the one. Unless you have something better in mind?
[18:32:59] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: btw, the pastebin will expire in 6 days. So we might want to create a new one without expiration.
[18:34:28] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: I should probably get around to fixing that, but I don't think the expiration actually works properly...
[18:53:47] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: ah, and to answer your question - no, that one is great. I've never gotten around to fixing it, but was actually annoyed by it again just today, when I wanted to run tests in VS Code with a virtualenv and they failed because of a missing QtWebKit.
[18:54:49] <pylbrecht> great, then I'll hopefully come back with a PR soon.
