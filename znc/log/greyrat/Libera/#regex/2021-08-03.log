[08:01:29] <ChrisM> Hmm maybee
[08:01:37] <ChrisM> Thanks let me try it out
[08:02:47] <digitok> not sure what you're doing, but this one also removes the commas, https://regex101.com/r/gmhuy0/3
[08:03:29] <digitok> it doesn't remove the ones that are just [""], not sure what you want to do with those

[08:06:41] <digitok> hehe
[08:07:04] <ChrisM> =)  regex can do anything lol 
[08:07:22] <digitok> yep
[08:07:32] <ChrisM> Good to have options, not sure which way is better yet =)
[08:07:39] <digitok> :D
[08:08:24] <digitok> i noticed you already had one [] in the data, so thought it'd match that one
[08:08:44] <digitok> kinda looks a bit nicer too
[08:11:10] <ChrisM> Yeah, I agree I think that is going to be the best

[13:24:12] <re101-dingo-89> I need help on creating a regex pattern that matches digits or floats I tried and its working
[13:24:36] <re101-dingo-89> ^-?\d*\.{0,1}\d+$
[13:24:49] <re101-dingo-89> now I want to extend 2 more condition
[13:24:58] <re101-dingo-89> 1-> should not start with 0
[13:25:14] <digitok> 07{0,1} can be simplified to 07?
[13:25:23] <re101-dingo-89> 2-> should not start with a period(.)
[13:25:54] <digitok> ^-?[1-9]\d*(?:\.\d+)?$
[13:26:25] <re101-dingo-89> no there should be either 1 dot or no dot at all thats the reason Im using {0,1}
[13:26:38] <digitok> yep, that's what 07? does
[13:26:50] <digitok> but we don't need it now
[13:26:54] <re101-dingo-89> Oh okay thank you
[13:27:22] <digitok> this regex also assumes that 070 is invalid (aswell as 0701 etc)
[13:27:28] <digitok> as well*
[13:28:11] <re101-dingo-89> can I stop that
[13:28:27] <re101-dingo-89> I mean now its not matching for -01 also
[13:28:52] <digitok> so what do you mean by 07should not start with 0?
[13:28:58] <re101-dingo-89> can I make it work for this -01
[13:29:14] <re101-dingo-89> only the first character shouldn't be 0
[13:29:35] <digitok> what about 070.5?
[13:30:01] <re101-dingo-89> it should not match
[13:30:06] <digitok> ^(?!0)-?\d+(?:\.\d+)?$
[13:30:58] <re101-dingo-89> superb

[20:59:12] <zeflik> Thanks for this! I'll paste all my test cases and check whether they pass or not.

[21:16:30] <OnlineCop> `^[^/]+\K<br>` is probably doing something unexpected. From the start of the line, it finds any non-/ characters. But you're telling it to then backtrack till it finds the last <br> on the line.

[22:29:49] <re101-goat-29> How to split them?
