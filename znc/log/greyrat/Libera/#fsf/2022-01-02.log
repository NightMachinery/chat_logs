[04:22:50] <Kaiod> Now, if you are going to accuse a health agency of any attitude that does not comply with its function, I ask you to cite more sources, if possible, of greater reliability.

[11:05:49] <kompowiec> > all the success of the red bull brand is marketing. And since it was a new product (didn't) exist in Europe, there was no demand for it, they had to produce it themselves and choose their target group. What did they do?
[11:05:52] <kompowiec> > they went with their product directly to people, mainly men aged 18-35. They targeted student parties, libraries, cafes, milk bars and other places where they spent their time. By providing free samples to their recipients, they gave the product directly into the hands of consumers, which in turn made them talk about it, spreading information about the product for free (word of mouth marketing). Currently, not much has 
[11:05:52] <kompowiec> changed, they go where their audience is, often sponsoring many events.
[11:05:58] <kompowiec> > redbull has proven its marketing effectiveness by taking its product and associating it with things that its audience loves. By sponsoring and creating events, they were selling their brand name as a symbol, rather than just promoting the product
[11:06:04] <kompowiec> source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAXY3CSdmhE
[11:07:18] <kompowiec> is this what the FSF is missing?
[11:08:20] <kompowiec> just take the example of FSF RYF. Nobody even knows about this certificate and is not interested in advertising in this way. This could be changed.
[11:09:51] <kompowiec> even librem he did not want to adapt the hardware to its requirements, only taking care of the PureOS approval, despite the fact that their product is not the cheapest.

[11:17:02] <epony> yes, it's total BS
[11:18:29] <kompowiec> > what can we learn from red bull - as you can see, the product itself is not enough, you still need to advertise it properly, pack it, find the right target group and then sell it.
[11:19:14] <kompowiec> I discovered about the FSF myself only thanks to open source, because they simply understand marketing better.
[11:19:31] <epony> it's not about marketing, at all
[11:19:48] <kompowiec> what then?
[11:19:50] <epony> it's about "giving advice" to people that could be useful
[11:20:07] <epony> the opposite of marketing, which is harmful
[11:20:35] <kompowiec> marketing harmful? why?
[11:21:24] <kompowiec> Word of mouth marketing is probably the most effective and probably the least harmful type of marketing I know.
[11:21:52] <epony> marketing is always harmful
[11:21:54] <epony> it is lies
[11:22:33] <epony> the technical specification / listing of application notes is the real information (catalogues of electronics components, modules, software)
[11:22:43] <kompowiec> in word-of-mouth marketing you don't even have a way to lie, because consumers simply do the advertisement for you.
[11:22:52] <epony> every marketing is a lie
[11:23:55] <epony> it changes the accurate technical information into something else which is not reality and deceives and robs people of their ability to choose and compare or think independently
[11:23:57] <kompowiec> I completely don't understand this approach. It's only a tool, it cannot be clearly stated that it serves good or evil.
[11:24:11] *** Joins: the_lanetly_052 (~the_lanet@185.30.91.93)
[11:24:13] <epony> it's the BS that is called capitalism, marketing lies and advertising crap
[11:24:31] <kompowiec> especially in whisper marketing
[11:24:52] <epony> it results in consumerism and defective products and produce that is really harmful to your health and computing
[11:25:44] <epony> there is nothing to understand, you either pretend you are incapable of reading or you make your conclusions that there is no concession and marketing is comdemned as lies and deceit and dishonest abuse of naive suckers
[11:26:33] <kompowiec> I am simply surprised by such dichotomous thinking.
[11:26:53] <epony> no, it's no nothing like that
[11:27:09] <kompowiec> marketing is as much a tool as any other.
[11:27:11] <epony> it's precisely "marketing is a dangerous lie and deceit that harms people"
[11:27:34] <epony> no, it's a destructive abuse of society and its vulnerable uneducated and gullible suckers
[11:27:38] <kompowiec> without it, even if you have a great quality product but nobody knows about it, it won't be "sold"
[11:27:50] <epony> exactly, the product is not great
[11:28:01] <kompowiec> no matter if you are "selling" a product or an idea.
[11:28:09] <epony> if it was, you'd just need to know you need a "product" without a brand and name of something attached to it
[11:28:29] <epony> you have no idea what life actually is outside the soap bubble of consumerism and you're probably a marketing bot
[11:28:31] <epony> ;-)
[11:28:42] <epony> I mean a marketing doll.
[11:29:18] <epony> since all that comes out of you so far is "pleading of acceptance of marketing" as something useful, while it is evil and disgusting
[11:29:30] <epony> marketing is abuse and dangerous to humanity
[11:29:37] <epony> should be forbidden by law
[11:29:59] <kompowiec> and therefore even Arduino has no interest in getting FSF RYF certified, even though it would have easily earned it? Currently, this certificate is almost worthless, in the social consciousness.
[11:31:13] <kompowiec> > you're probably a marketing bot
[11:31:14] <kompowiec> in fact, I haven't read any book on marketing yet
[11:31:35] <epony> it's just lies and deceit and advertisement of toxins, poisons, pollution, and destruction of nature and wildlife for the greedy consumerism exploiters you call capitalists and financialised forced consumption propagandists (servants of industrial-production complexes)

[11:32:32] <epony> completely artificial and bogus
[11:32:36] <kompowiec> whether it is free is of secondary importance to them.
[11:32:47] <epony> "inflated" and "worthless" in reality
[11:33:38] <epony> marketing is just a word for "selling lies and deceit" (that is what capitalism is built upon, lies and taking advantage of others with deceit and forced services / goods consumption)
[11:34:00] <kompowiec> epony, IMO you dazzle with pointless antagonism
[11:34:10] <epony> your opinion is irrelevant to me
[11:34:27] <kompowiec> is not essential. However, there is no evidence.
[11:34:38] <kompowiec> it's just tool like any other
[11:34:53] <epony> it is you who filed for a "marketing eval" by submitting your "marketing topic" for review (and you get a direct and unoppinionated evaluation from reality)
[11:34:53] <GNUHacker> hi
[11:35:30] <epony> it's not a nothing, tools are instruments and instrumentation, marketing is false misinformation, lies and deceit
[11:36:47] <kompowiec> you stated that all marketing is a lie. Is this really true in all cases? IMO whisper marketing it's not harmful, because I do not see any gap at which point it could be faulty.
[11:37:10] <epony> there is no "less harmful" lie
[11:37:22] <kompowiec> unless the customers play the phone deaf themselves.
[11:37:25] <epony> it's either technical specification and direct statement of reality or not
[11:38:51] <epony> marketing is waste of energy and human brain processing capacity, it's the complete deterioration of mental operation for most people who are subjected to such abuse, should be illegal and prohibited by law and regulation
[11:38:59] <kompowiec> so, following this line of reasoning, are popular science sources also bad?
[11:39:14] <epony> no, you do not follow no such "assumptions"
[11:39:27] <epony> that's what deceit tries to do, don't do that ;-)
[11:40:29] <labrador> epony talks in the likeness of a 4chan troll

[11:41:24] <labrador> epony, no u
[11:41:29] <kompowiec> I'm trying to understand. you stated that either there is a technical specification or not. I assume that your assumption was that translating it into a language understandable to ordinary people is worthless, so I compared it with popular science.
[11:41:31] <epony> labrador, stfu ;-)
[11:42:09] <labrador> epony, no. Why can't you be calm
[11:42:14] <labrador> Just take a deep breath
[11:42:16] <epony> marketing is not that, it is misleading for the purpose of presenting incorrectly exaggerated fictitions advantages
[11:42:19] <labrador> And now exhale
[11:42:23] <epony> labrador, piss off
[11:42:31] <labrador> epony, see?

[11:43:45] <kompowiec> ok, epony, starts using personal attacks. I disconnect from the discussion.
[11:43:59] <epony> kompowiec, wrong, it's labrador interfering
[11:44:15] <labrador> epony, why do you need to call marketing deceit and lies in the first place
[11:44:18] <labrador> you're the troll
[11:44:20] <labrador> not me
[11:44:24] <epony> he's been doing it forever, cause he is a childish person
[11:44:29] <epony> labrador, stfu
[11:44:52] <epony> labrador, that's the hard reality, all marketing is lies and deceit, now go read up again
[11:45:11] <epony> it's already been said, no need to repeat it ad nauseam
[11:45:43] <epony> ask your friends, relatives, parents, see what they tell you, compare with "hard reality", learn.. evaluate.. build your own opinion
[11:45:59] <epony> the facts are, marketing is a scam intended to fill your brain with noise
[11:46:02] <epony> that's all
[11:46:21] <epony> you're really damaging and filling your neural networks with crap that way
[11:46:29] <kompowiec> epony, the suspicion of being a troll is not yet an accusation. Now stop using personal attacks, or you will just be reported to moderation.
[11:46:32] <epony> just avoid it if you can for 5-10 years and see how your life changes
[11:46:50] <epony> kompowiec, don't tell me what to say or how to act, you're not a parent of nobody
[11:46:59] <epony> report to whomever you like
[11:46:59] <labrador> Why are you so extreme lmao. How will people even know about a product if you don't market?
[11:47:02] <labrador> Like what?
[11:47:05] <epony> cause that's the reality
[11:47:35] <epony> why are you so "socially manipulated" to be less "accurate" and "precise" in your evaluations?
[11:48:10] <labrador> ugh,do you wear a tinfoil hat too?
[11:48:24] <epony> you search for it, on your own.. if you did not search for it, you have a difficult time reducing unneeded information
[11:48:24] <labrador> what does socially manipulated even mean
[11:48:35] <kompowiec> labrador, trolls usually make people rage without actually giving away too much. Think of it as standing on a line, but not crossing it
[11:48:36] <DiffieHellman> Marketing via word of mouth is fine, illegal marketing tactics are not though
[11:48:59] <epony> all marketing is lies, what people you know and trust tell you, is their own life story
[11:49:13] <labrador> What if somebody paid your friends o advertise
[11:49:23] <labrador> Now those are influencers
[11:49:24] <epony> then these people are not your friends
[11:49:34] <epony> they are "automatic" marketing
[11:49:42] <kompowiec> if it was trolling, it was extremely weak because he didn't prove that *all* marketing is harmful and deceptive.
[11:49:43] <labrador> The truth is nobody knows if somebody recommending a product is true or not
[11:49:59] <DiffieHellman> That's not acceptable unless they tell the truth and that they're being paid
[11:50:08] <labrador> So why not just block all ads and everything.
[11:50:17] <labrador> And just look around for products when you need em
[11:50:23] <labrador> Simple
[11:50:36] <epony> kompowiec, you do not get the luxury of proof against your own false claim, be a smart person and learn to read, instead of pretending to not understand, and requesting spoonfed citaions, no citations coming your way for this.
[11:50:41] <DiffieHellman> I do refsu to load all ads on the internet myself because of tracking.
[11:51:00] <labrador> DiffieHellman, I do because of that and because I hate advertising
[11:51:16] <epony> online, marketing is a dangerous and abusive surveillance and hostile payload delivery vectors
[11:51:26] <kompowiec> ok it's definitely trolling. epony argumentum ad ignorantiam
[11:51:34] <labrador> You can be manipulated psycologically(I can never get that right) without you knowing
[11:51:51] <DiffieHellman> Yup, but I resist that hard
[11:52:05] <labrador> Show too many nordvpn ads and bam. When you need a vpn the first thing coming to your mind will be *Ah yes nordvpn*
[11:52:07] <epony> kompowiec, now you want me to call you some retaliation word for trolling -> I'll just call you stupid beyond repair on purpose, so the real marketing troll is you.
[11:52:10] <labrador> Thats why I hate them
[11:52:35] <DiffieHellman> I just think; nordvpn == bad
[11:52:36] <kompowiec> labrador, in fact, out of two bad guys, I'd rather try to be manipulated than be lied to. Why? Beucase manipulation is easier to detected: https://github.com/kompowiec/An-organized-collection-of-fallacies
[11:53:08] <labrador> Thats true kompowiec ,but ideally I'd have none
[11:53:19] <labrador> DiffieHellman, one step more. vpn == bad
[11:53:27] <kompowiec> to prove a lie, you need to research. To prove manipulation, it is enough to point to it.
[11:53:30] <DiffieHellman> That too

[11:53:38] <labrador> It gives an idea of privacy when there is none
[11:53:48] <labrador> Tor is your best bet
[11:53:59] <labrador> and kax17 is going to break that too
[11:54:01] <epony> to prove you're stupid, you just need to open your mouth and pretend to advertise (marketing) a failed and false claim
[11:54:04] <labrador> ugh I hate nations
[11:54:36] <epony> kompowiec, your weak marketing defendist campaign is pointless
[11:55:00] <corwin> defendist?
[11:55:06] <labrador> ?
[11:55:28] <kompowiec> ignore him, he trolls via strawman
[11:55:41] <corwin> i'm with u on the nations thing btw. stupid thing ever to build countries from, but you know how hard it can be getting ppl to upgrade.
[11:55:50] <epony> yeah, marketing advocacy is pointless, all people will tell you marketing is a lie, deceit and useless waste of resources and energy
[11:55:52] <DiffieHellman> Irc /ignore is rarely needed, but with epony it is
[11:56:19] * epony thinks DiffieHellman is being an ostridge.
[11:56:22] <corwin> Great nick :D
[11:56:22] <labrador> epony, can you prove what you're saying instead of just spewing information
[11:56:38] <DiffieHellman> kompowiec: You can at least irrefutable disprove a lie. You can just continue manipulation if you point it out thought.
[11:56:47] <labrador> The burden of proof lies on the challenger
[11:56:51] <epony> labrador, open the link I gave you.
[11:57:01] <labrador> ok
[11:57:10] <epony> labrador, the challenger is the liar who says marketing is useful, it's not.
[11:57:18] <epony> nobody cares about such claims
[11:58:30] <kompowiec> DiffieHellman, mirroring is sometimes fun but increases the flame unnecessarily, so it is better to ignore it.
[11:58:58] <DiffieHellman> I embrace heavy flaming as long as good points are being made rather than just goalpost moving.
[11:59:19] <epony> it's a simple thing to understand, consumerism is hated outside USA
[11:59:48] <corwin> are you working from statistics, saying that?
[11:59:56] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence#Contrived_durability
[12:00:02] <corwin> Buying things is a way of life in a great number of places.
[12:00:04] <epony> corwin, are you talking to me?
[12:00:23] <corwin> yes I was.
[12:00:29] <epony> ok, had to be certain
[12:00:31] <labrador> consooom
[12:00:36] <labrador> be a consoomer
[12:00:39] <epony> "shop till you drop"
[12:00:53] <DiffieHellman> I try to avoid consooooming mysolf
[12:01:04] <labrador> And also die of a heart attack at 31 cause you're 125 kilos
[12:01:33] <epony> no, that happens because you took narcotics
[12:01:50] <DiffieHellman> Only 125kg? A good consooomer is 200kg.
[12:02:02] <corwin> I mean, it's hard to get buy not buying stuff and I don't think of that as a "local problem".
[12:02:07] <kompowiec> DiffieHellman, when i discuss with populist i know 2 strategies: reject heuristics X = power or proving the golden rule.
[12:02:23] <labrador> corwin, talk to those who buy an iphone every second year
[12:02:31] <labrador> Those are mega peak ultra consooomers
[12:02:43] <kompowiec> both effective, they often leave the site by themselves without moderation
[12:02:48] <labrador> You will come out scarred for live
[12:02:52] <labrador> life*
[12:02:58] <epony> buying is not a disease, the disease is "having no spare brain cells because your mental capacity for real information is replaced by advertisements and marketing, also known as false information"
[12:03:32] <epony> consumerism is one of the attacks on democracy
[12:03:33] <corwin> well, critical thinking has rarely been in the interested of established powers to promote.
[12:03:43] <labrador> true
[12:04:02] <labrador> But people also continue this onto their children
[12:04:07] <labrador> Like religion
[12:04:13] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism#Consumerism_as_cultural_ideology
[12:04:27] <corwin> I think of consumerisim as "one more port in a storm" in terms of trying to redirect an inteligent populus away from thoughts of disparity.
[12:04:39] <kompowiec> labrador, + amoral familism https://theshiftnews.com/2018/11/17/the-appeal-to-hypocrisy/
[12:04:49] <labrador> corwin, yeah and reduce them to the humans in wall-e
[12:05:00] <labrador> Can't even run smh
[12:05:32] <epony> people are distracted with 12 different same thing different label and colour, so they have to fight the excess false product separation scouring for "affordable pricing" to survive on low salaries and get all their lifetime wasted chasing "ads and lies"
[12:05:37] <kompowiec> it's so funny when someone tries to prove moral superiority with tu qoque, while making it even worse.
[12:05:57] <epony> it's the wasted lives of billions of people

[12:11:18] <kompowiec> probably*

[12:17:46] <epony> that list of active undermines of democracy is actually happening under "whatever" externalised and "non-critical" threat
[12:19:29] <epony> you know the definitions of capitalism as "total war" by non-western economists and fundamental political science theorists is actually correct
[12:22:35] <epony> we're all living in some variant of economic capital and financial system, so then it turns out the war machine is a systemic problem of some models of government, not actually the economic system
[12:22:47] <epony> so.. make your conclusions, how people are manipulated
[12:23:17] <epony> and if marketing as propaganda and coercion is not one of the main tools to control the domestic population and keep them busy with useless activities
[12:26:06] <epony> in the realms of technical and accurately descriptive information: software, hardware, information, technical and scientific domains and disciplines, the word marketnig and commercial advertising stands out as "completely irrelevant" and "harmful" in fact converting and abusing science to actively harm large populations of foreign and domestic populations and void them of basic human rights and necessities and damage their health and shorten or terminate their 
[12:26:06] <epony> lifetimes on purpose
[12:26:28] <epony> it's really sinister and evil, this thing you call "marketing" and 'advertisement'

[19:32:13] <Kaiod> jxself: I think what they consider extreme, is how people impose their opinion on the issue. In a way, I agree in parts about this, because many people think that this HAS TO BE DONE IMMEDIATELY IN A FAST AND EXTREME WAY, and that is not how the process of education and learning about anything works.

[19:40:01] <isf> dude read it and then say your opinion realu
[19:40:10] <Kaiod> isf: I read, I read what the FSF board posted about his return
[19:40:28] <Kaiod> isf: I read it, I told you, stop repeating it
[19:41:01] <isf> understand that OSI and other big companys try to fuck us from a e-mail from 2006 or something like that
[19:41:02] <labrador> Kaiod, he is a person who strongly questions everything,a logical person. I honour that. Knee-jerking stuff emotionally helps no one. Rather it limits you. Once he realized why it was bad,he took back his words. But alas! rationality is not valued by today's society. Just virtue signalling.
[19:41:28] <isf> you dont read it Kaiod. maybe other read it for you
[19:41:35] <isf> try to make your own opinion about it
[19:42:01] <kompowiec> I come to the sadder conclusions that people don't value logic either, instead, populism is rampant.

[19:43:39] <Kaiod> Stop, many of you here are not teenagers, and don't know what it is like to go through a rape situation. What he said was terrible, and regardless of whether this was meant to hurt him, he said it and it was HORRIBLE. I don't support what he said, and I never will. If he's going to get better, great, prove it, but don't expect me to approve of his mistake.
[19:43:39] <isf> rms in the mails?

[19:49:32] <Kaiod> belgin: It took an hour
[19:49:38] <belgin> oh ok
[19:49:41] <isf> so, he arent promoting rape childrens 
[19:49:48] <belgin> thanks, Kaiod 
[19:50:16] <isf> becouse that is inmoral, and ilegal 
[19:50:29] <kompowiec> even in the quoted passage he writes that it's must voluntary lol
[19:50:32] <isf> he put his private ideas in a public e-mail
[19:51:31] <Kaiod> isf: You're only here to defend him, I can see that. I'm not going to argue with you, because you don't understand the seriousness of the matter. You've never been in a situation like this, and I hope you won't. But I hope he will bear the consequences of what he said, as he is paying for this today.
[19:52:17] <kompowiec> Kaiod, Whether we like it or not, people do it, kids date kids through their favorite Snapchat platforms or something.
[19:52:43] <isf> on the internet you can see hundreds of people promoting the sexualization of children
[19:52:47] <isf> and that are inmoral and wrong
[19:52:54] <isf> but they do it, but you what do? NOTHING
[19:54:02] <Kaiod> kompowiec: Yes, the relationship between children is common, even healthy, depending on where it goes. But not pedophilia.
[19:54:39] <Kaiod> isf: Okay, tell me who they are and I will take them to the police, in Brazil, the safernet.
[19:54:52] <isf> Kaiod So, at the beginning what to do is reject the bad and take the good, take this as a dualism is the mistake, and I understand the position of being against everything that has a fault. But you must realize that this is an attack against the movement, and not an attempt to do social joticia.
[19:54:52] <kompowiec> for me, the final limit of morality is the golden rule, and I stick to it. Whatever was written there didn't break this rule, so it's ok.
[19:55:47] <kompowiec> so there is nothing to get excited about something, yall can diverge.
[19:56:13] <vivien> Kaiod, you’re right, these opinions are wrong (https://stallman.org/archives/2019-sep-dec.html#14_September_2019_(Sex_between_an_adult_and_a_child_is_wrong))
[19:56:14] <isf> television is the first to transform women into prostitutes and men into homosexuals and for me that is just as bad as stealing or any other evil, but not for that reason I promote the idea of restricting the individual rights of kaiod
[19:56:32] <Kaiod> isf: This is an attack against RMS, so much so that I wanted to get him out of the FSF, not destroy it. The work in the FSF is collective, and for me, the problem is RMS's vision, which is idiotic.
[19:57:02] <isf> Do you really not realize that the collective is against the individual good?
[19:57:32] <kompowiec> Kaiod, you have a right to your opinion, but you do not have to impose it on others.
[19:57:52] <isf> what they try, that between the ideology of the common good within our ideas of freedom, something contrary to freedom.
[19:58:46] <Kaiod> kompowiec: Pedophilia is not opinion, and I have the full right to criticize and exclude any pedophilic attitude or thought.
[19:58:56] <isf> dude
[19:58:59] <Kaiod> "Through personal conversations in recent years, I've learned to understand how sex with a child can harm per psychologically. This changed my mind about the matter: I think adults should not do that. I am grateful for the conversations that enabled me to understand why."
[19:58:59] <kompowiec> so yo break golden rule.
[19:59:02] <kompowiec> you*
[19:59:15] <kompowiec> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule
[19:59:24] <isf> Pedophilia is bad and is wrong, but the first who promoting it is the TV and traditional social media
[19:59:38] <isf> so first go to speak against them
[19:59:52] <kompowiec> Kaiod, and it's sad because you are proving at this point that you are amoral.
[20:00:01] <isf> and then see who they are trying to attack us via a non good opinions of RMS about rape
[20:00:22] <labrador> Kaiod, do you even know what you're spouting? Do you even know what's pedophilia? You literally cannot be pedophilic towards a teenager. That wording just makes pedophilia look less weirder than what it actually is
[20:00:25] <isf> we dont say what rape are good Kaiod you dont realy understend
[20:01:34] <isf> we dont defend the wrong ideas of RMS but, all here incluing you have inmoral ideas
[20:01:38] <Kaiod> labrador: I suffered about it when I was a child, and you ? do you even know what you are saying?
[20:02:07] <kompowiec> oh dude... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy
[20:02:08] <isf> dude Kaiod we dont defend the bad ideas of RMS
[20:02:21] <labrador> And no sex between two teenagers is not right. They cannot consent,but we don't punish them to spare them the consequences of their stupidity.
[20:02:42] <labrador> Thats what romeo-juliet laws are
[20:02:45] <Kaiod> He was wrong and that's it, there is no other point since he himself admitted that he was wrong in his notes. If you haven't experienced this, or are not professionals in the field, that's enough 
[20:03:02] <labrador> Kaiod, he was wrong at first,but then correct after
[20:03:08] <labrador> I myself admit
[20:03:10] <kompowiec> kaiod is triggered, he must calm down
[20:03:20] <labrador> that he must
[20:04:06] <labrador> Kaiod, I am deeply sorry for that but pedophilia is technically attraction towards pre pubescent children. Teenagers are already not pre pubescent. They are children though
[20:04:06] <isf> He had a bad opinion, but only that one opinion Kaiod
[20:04:31] <Kaiod> He was wrong and now he has to make amends for what he did. He hasn't proven that he has changed or anything, writing an article on the FSF website anyone can do, I want to see a change in attitude.
[20:04:42] <isf> he is wrong like you are wrong Kaiod
[20:04:51] <isf> but not in the same things
[20:04:53] <belgin> would you please stop talking about sex here?
[20:05:06] <labrador> belgin, good idea
[20:05:14] <kompowiec> Kaiod, who are you to tell others what to do?
[20:05:23] <kompowiec> pls stop doing this
[20:05:24] <isf> so, you start to respect the different opinions, or you go to be alone crying

[20:05:33] <labrador> vivien, I do not
[20:06:08] <isf> isnt reasonable try to kick off all differents opinons when are good or bads, if are bad ideas dude, dont do it
[20:06:28] <Kaiod> Are you an adolescent specialist or do you work in the health department, or are you an adolescent? In your jurisdiction, you put whatever age you want. No one deserves to go through that, child, youth or adult. RMS said what he didn't know and was wrong, it doesn't seem like change to me at the moment, and you show the same point.
[20:06:36] <isf> im not pro-pedophilia but im not pro cancelling people the right for expresion 
[20:06:59] <labrador> RMS is reasonable,that is the nice thing about him,his views can be changed by logic and reason. A lot of people's cannot,like Kaiod here.
[20:06:59] <kompowiec> he broke the golden rule of ethics, so he is amoral at this point.
[20:07:10] <isf> Kaiod, do you want to put rms in jail?
[20:07:20] <kompowiec> and he don't have any redeeming
[20:07:23] <Kaiod> If someone has a pedophile opinion, he is wrong. There's no discussion, if he's rasuavile or whatever, he's wrong just the same.

But there shouldn't be a fixation on his image, he is an activist, and so are all of us here.
[20:52:38] <labrador> You need a figure head,a martyr perhaps is a good analogue,for a movement.
[20:52:51] <Kaiod> labrador: No, I don't aspire to be him, he is not my idol, and this thought is horrible. I am not inspired by anyone, I like many within free software, from FSFE, Mozilla, KDE, even the linux community, there are several people.

[21:06:12] <ggoes> i had an x200 but it died last year, and got this because the libreboot flash process was easy. or rather, there wasn't one. you can just flash it without ever opening it
