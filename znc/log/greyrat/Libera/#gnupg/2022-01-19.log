[00:00:00] <labrador> euouae, do your keys use a real name?
[00:00:04] <euouae> yeah
[00:00:33] <labrador> oh yeah then we can't. That would require some proof. But wait,how are your users verifying you then?
[00:00:43] <labrador> My keys are connected to labrador
[00:00:47] <euouae> it's the tofu principle for my users
[00:00:51] <labrador> So the proof is me talking to you
[00:01:09] <euouae> this is analogous to having a fake identity
[00:01:14] <labrador> euouae, not that good of an idea
[00:01:18] <labrador> euouae, its not fake
[00:01:23] <euouae> i.e. your best friend might be lying to you about who they are, turns out they're a KGB assassin
[00:01:30] <labrador> Just not connected to my meat body
[00:01:39] <labrador> euouae, lmao
[00:01:48] <euouae> so what trust you assign to them is up to you, and there's not much we can assign to each other
[00:01:51] <hnj> euouae: you can still send encrypted email without "properly" verifying the user, itâ€™s a kind of "opportunistic encryption" AFAIU
[00:01:53] <euouae> me and you
[00:01:59] <labrador> hnj, well yes
[00:02:02] <labrador> We can do that
[00:02:30] <labrador> But still euouae,tofu is not that good of a model
[00:02:35] <labrador> Especially for software
[00:02:41] <euouae> hnj, yeah and it's very useful for activists who come in contact with journalists
[00:02:59] <euouae> but I don't need that 
[00:03:11] <GNUHacker> send me ur keys
[00:03:36] <hnj> also: verification doesnâ€™t always have to involve real names (as in the one on your passport). itâ€™s IMHO ok to verify a UID for an IRC nickname or so. IIRC keybase does that? or twitter accounts?
[00:03:37] <euouae> labrador, yeah I agree but it's better than nothing
[00:04:04] <euouae> hnj, depends on your paranoia, I don't want to trust someone I don't know
[00:04:10] <euouae> nick takeovers are possible
[00:04:10] <labrador> euouae, yeah as hnj said,you could add a uid called euouae to your keys
[00:04:16] <labrador> And then I sign on that
[00:04:21] <labrador> That would be fine
[00:04:23] <labrador> I think
[00:04:50] <euouae> hmmm that complicates key management, I'd rather only manage what I manage
[00:05:12] <labrador> euouae, it feels like you're the epitome of laziness lmao
[00:05:16] <euouae> I guess there is a point about having multiple personas (e.g. separate work from personal) 
[00:05:29] <euouae> yeah I know, I suck
[00:06:21] <GNUHacker> euouae: you want a libre mail provider? try https://disroot.org
[00:07:46] <euouae> looks cool, I'll keep it in mind 
[00:09:15] <hnj> euouae: email address takeovers too (;
[00:09:17] <euouae> what I'd like to learn more about after I finish with gnupg is tor
[00:09:49] <euouae> and I'd like to get a job doing security related stuff. That would be cool
[00:10:34] <euouae> looking under the hood terrifies me. Whether it's an online public/private service or open source code, there's some scary stuff
[00:11:41] <GNUHacker> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
[00:12:03] <euouae> maybe I disagree with RMS ;)
[00:12:11] <euouae> RMS has his concerns and I have mine
[00:12:58] <GNUHacker> I support RMS https://stallmansupport.org
[00:13:07] <euouae> for one thing, preaching to the choir is not very useful, and for another, I have alternative theories about what is important
[00:13:13] *** Quits: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:14:58] <euouae> Yeah I'm familiar with that stuff
[00:18:39] <euouae> OK so you're saying 'free software' is the right term -- and yeah I do prefer gplv3 for my stuff, although I've never published anything
[00:20:01] <euouae> so apart from gpg and tor I'm also interested in 'the update framework'
[00:20:10] <euouae> I would like to learn more about that too one day. Ever heard of it?
[00:21:32] <euouae> GNUHacker btw my opinion is that non-free software, apart from infringing on users freedoms is also endangering national security! 
[00:22:33] <GNUHacker> sure
[00:23:04] <euouae> think e.g. of iPhone and Pegasus spyware
[00:23:06] <GNUHacker> but i dont give a fuck the national security, i want be free
[00:23:28] <euouae> OK that's your interests versus mine :) 
[00:23:37] <euouae> so of course we can be different...

[02:09:10] <lovetruth> Hello :)
[02:10:40] <lovetruth> For some reason - no idea why, gpg-agent refuses to die when I use killall gpg-agent    from inside a script (yes, I'm running as root), but it actually dies whenever I do it from a ssh session... Any idea why?!... (And how to kill the agent and remove the socket files?...)
[02:14:33] <euouae> don't use kilall
[02:14:47] <lovetruth> euouae, but?...
[02:15:10] <euouae> gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
[02:16:50] <lovetruth> I've actually tried that :) ...
[02:17:08] <lovetruth> It behaved *exactly* the same (inside the script it didn't, in the ssh session it worked)
[02:25:19] <hnj> lovetruth: Iâ€™m curious: why do you want to kill gpg-agent as root in a script?
[02:29:14] <lovetruth> hnj, I actually want to pack the whole $GNUPGHOME folder inside a .tar and then encrypt it with a symmetric key for later use
[02:29:25] <lovetruth> And I don't want to do it while it's open
[02:30:04] <lovetruth> Also... I don't want to try to tar the temporary files (pubring.kbx~, the socket files) 
[02:33:05] <hnj> "while itâ€™s open"?
[02:34:46] <lovetruth> The gpg-agent, I meant :) it stays open for some reason even if I gog-conf --kill gog-agent
[02:35:12] <hnj> so? why not just leave it?
[02:35:33] <lovetruth> Sorry for the "gog" misspell - but I have a nasty autocorrect :) I meant gpg-conf
[02:45:20] <euouae> cp -r --preserve=all ~/.gnupg gnupgbackup
[02:45:57] <euouae> I'm not sure why you are worried about gpg-agent
[02:46:54] <euouae> you don't need to encrypt the gnupg directory, just encrypt the backup filesystem that you will put it in
[02:47:26] <euouae> the private keys are protected as far as I can tell by a password already

[04:11:41] <lovetruth> I can't encrypt "the backup filesystem" (not easily and not safely enough: it's a raspberry pi 4b. It doesn't have some TPM hardware module or something... so... I wanted to encrypt everything inside a tar.gpg file)
[04:14:13] <lovetruth> And about the gog-agent - it's not just the temporary files (even that getting rid of the temporary files it's good), but it's also a security thing: I have integrity checks from time to time - the system might have some memory leaks etc... I want to be more sure that the keyring it's fully closed.
[04:15:58] <lovetruth> I might end up simply not starting the agent at all - even it was beneficial that I didn't have to put in the password so many times (I have multiple archives encrypted with asymmetric encryption that I decrypt/update/reencrypt & eventually performing other changes onto them)
[04:17:05] *** Quits: georgios (~georgios@user/georgios) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[04:17:58] <lovetruth> so... if you think that it's not possible to kill the agent nicely... - I might not start the gog-agent altogether!... :) (now, that I think of it - I think I might have a background process keeping it open?...)

[21:35:27] <labrador> Hi
[21:35:38] <GNUHacker> hi
[21:35:43] <labrador> Is there a way to force gpg to sign with a particular key? I want to make this change in conf files as evolution(mail client) probably just does a gpg -s. Also how would I see what the current default signing key is?
[21:35:53] <labrador> The only reason I have to care about this is because I made my master key [SC] by mistake
[21:36:02] <labrador> Encryption is being already done by a subkey as thats the only [E] key available

[22:26:32] <labrador> henk, what?
[22:27:50] *** Joins: duxsco (~Thunderbi@user/duxsco)
[22:28:19] <henk> labrador: I think thatâ€™s how you can specify a subkey to use. wasnâ€™t that your question?
[22:30:52] <labrador> henk, yes. But how do I put it in gpg.conf?
[22:31:07] <labrador> ALso how do I verify that it actually uses that key?
[22:34:59] <duxsco> labrador: without knowing the whole discussion: what about "default-key 0xasdfasdf" in gpg.conf? this can be overwritten with "gpg --local-user 0xqwerqwer" on the command line.
[22:36:01] <labrador> duxsco, ok. But I want it to be default only for signing
[22:36:09] <labrador> Is there a default-signing-key?
[22:39:25] *** Quits: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:39:38] <duxsco> read the manpage. it sets the default key for signing
