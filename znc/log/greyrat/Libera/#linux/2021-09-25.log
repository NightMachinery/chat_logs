[01:54:50] <n4dir> now that i think about it: i think there is a how-to at the mint forum to just use the file-manager to look at remote files

[01:56:12] <onelegend> SSHFS is actually faster than NFS on a shitty connection

[01:56:25] <onelegend> but NFSv4 gives a more stable mount
[01:56:25] <codebam> you can disable encryption and sshfs can be fast

[03:46:25] <Tripknotix> ayecee we dont need multi touch support, single touch will work for us, its only touched rarely during our presentation maybe once if at all
[03:46:45] <ayecee> cool but i don't know why you're telling me this
[03:47:02] <Karloff> if this "we" is a company contact your IT dept
[03:47:10] <ayecee> Karloff: come on man
[03:47:25] <Tripknotix> our software uses image recognition and nfc to comunicate with a mobile phone. but i did not write the original version, i just updated the ui's and fixed some bugs in python for the math. i cant modify the os and jeopardize the dependecies so close to a deadline
[03:47:37] <Tripknotix> our IT dept deals strictly with windows
[03:47:44] <ayecee> Tripknotix: it is an advantage here that the video goes through hdmi on this one.
[03:47:52] <Karloff> so you contract out
[03:47:57] <Tripknotix> =( the 2 people that wrote this software did not have touch screen in mind. that was my boss (the creative)'s idea
[03:48:00] <Karloff> how much is #linux in for?
[03:48:23] <ayecee> Karloff: take a break. i'll cover your shift.
[03:49:08] <Tripknotix> well considering my boss wants to return one to get a refund before buying another, when we need to get the monitor before oct4 and test it...
[03:49:17] <Tripknotix> $0.00 and a smile? =)

[03:50:50] <ayecee> but you'll need a beefy usb power supply for it
[03:51:08] <Tripknotix> any thoughts on the beetronics? other than that probably shouldnt trust it for using a 3rd party linux driver that is nowhere listed on the web site?

[03:51:30] <Tripknotix> its a desktop pc
[03:51:57] <Tripknotix> so we would be using the usb-c to usb-a touch+power and then hdmi cable
[03:51:58] <ayecee> does the desktop pc support usb pd? if not, a hub that supports usb pd would still be a good idea.
[03:52:16] <Tripknotix> you dont think the usb port can power it well enough?
[03:52:19] <Tripknotix>  hmmm
[03:52:22] <ayecee> it _might_ work without that, but i wouldn't count on it.
[03:52:27] <Tripknotix> i wonder if it was a power issue with the displaylink
[03:52:34] <ayecee> spec says 5V 2A
[03:53:23] <ayecee> usb ports are 5v 500mA and while you can often draw more, you can't count on it.
[03:53:38] <Tripknotix> interesting interesting, ok, well assuming we used a powered hub, that supports powering the device, you figure the eyoyo would work more so than the beetronics?

[03:58:41] <Karloff> next it'll be about off-world party drivers
[03:59:57] <Tripknotix> oh  i see that the "extra power port" is used if your other usb cant power the device
[04:00:00] <ayecee> and it can take power from both, so if one port doesn't provide enough power, you can use another.
[04:00:15] <ayecee> slick

[06:37:23] <n4dir> Guest3273: probably just focus on the ones others are based on
[06:37:24] <TJ-> I don't think Debian does encourage it; the extra load these type of parasite distros create can be quite considerable. Not so much an issue for niche low-volume but for more popular ones it is. It's externalising costs (hosting + bandwidth)

[06:40:23] <TJ-> E.g: in contrast Ubuntu syncs all source packages from Debian for each 6-month release, applies Ubuntu patches on top if required, and builds all the binary packages and hosts them. Linux mint sets sources.list to either Debian or Ubuntu depending on which 'base' is used and uses the binary packages built by Debian or Ubuntu

[08:20:57] <kailo> Hello, I just added a m2 nvme drive to a 10 year old pc via pcie adapter, and perf is pretty great in initial benchmarks.  Looking to move my linux install over to this drive, however booting from nvme is definitely not an option with this ancient bios.  I'm thinking to keep the mbr and swap on my hdd, but move the rest of the filesystem to the ssd.  What's the best way to achieve this?

[11:12:01] <jim> he doesn't think it's ideal, and I agree... all I'm saying is it could work
[11:12:07] <lopid> can you specify a proxy in winscp?
[11:12:08] <Bushdog> jim,  i think I know how you meant, for that I need to utilize Linux system file manager like Nemo, that WinSCP, i do not think I can put down internal IP again to get to server number 2
[11:12:32] <bindi> map. different. ports.
[11:12:54] <Bushdog> bindi,  dude, your suggestion is com0plicated to me okay,
[11:13:00] <bindi> its not
[11:13:01] <Bushdog> let me follow what jim  is suggesting
[11:13:04] *** Quits: thing (~thing@user/thing) (Quit: thing)
[11:13:04] <bindi> you managed to do it already
[11:13:23] <bindi> you have port forward from public address port 22 to internal address port 22
[11:13:28] <bindi> now you just need to make the public port unique
[11:13:40] <Bushdog> dude, managed to do what? I just opened port 22 and those suckers wont allow me to add port 22 for other servers, cos of port conflict
[11:13:57] <bindi> Yes. so change the port :D
[11:13:59] <n4dir> damn suckers.
[11:14:02] <bindi> Internally you need to use the same port 22
[11:14:17] <lopid> the little people in the router
[11:14:26] <n4dir> they are the worst !
[11:14:27] <Bushdog> change port, what do you mean dude, okay the other three Linux serevers, I can add other ports
[11:14:34] <jim> Bushdog, you need X forwarding, right?
[11:14:45] <bindi> You need to map another external port to another internal address at port 22
[11:14:50] <bindi> just copy the rule you made now
[11:14:52] <Bushdog> what the hell you mean now
[11:14:53] <bindi> change port 22 to 23
[11:14:54] <jim> you -could- do that, yes
[11:15:08] <n4dir> 23 might not be the best choice
[11:15:09] <jim> isn't 23 ftp?
[11:15:18] <bindi> i mentioned 2022 and 2023 earlier
[11:15:32] <jim> that would probably work better

[11:15:46] <n4dir> as hard times he has best is probably to use a different ssh  port for each PC he has.
[11:15:47] <bindi> but for simplicity's sake we can start with 22 and then 22+1
[11:15:54] <n4dir> even better would be not doing it at all
[11:16:02] <bindi> and then he realizes the outside port does not matter
[11:16:03] <lopid> said for the nth time, perhaps differently: in your router you have forwarded external port 22 to internal machine A port 22. add another: external port 2022 to internal machine B port 22

[11:21:43] <Bushdog> so give me external port then I need two for my other two servers to access remotely
[11:22:00] <bindi> you should choose a random external port other than 22 for security's sake as well
[11:22:05] <jim> bindi, but then if he does that, he will need another sshd listening at whatever port
[11:22:06] <bindi> because robots are hammering on 22

[13:17:09] <hexnewbie> paul424: docx2txt, odt2txt, abiword come to mind. OpenOffice is nearly obsolete. LibreOffice, like OpenOffice, does not take a lot of space compared to an OS, so you may consider cleaning up some. You're in trouble if you have that little that you can't install it. I know OpenWRT routers that can probably fit it (though the most expensive ones only)

[15:42:45] <phogg> -r is a synonym for "wait, what? Read does what? Why would you ever want that?! Can I make it NOT do that?"
[15:42:47] <PaulFertser> freemind: in general I would recommend to learn some high-level language which is not shell or awk unless you need your script to work on OpenWrt or other constrained environments.
[15:43:05] <phogg> scripting git in pure sh is very traditional
[15:43:17] <phogg> in that git was 50% sh for a lot of its lifespan
[15:43:17] <PaulFertser> True. But in Perl too.
[15:43:32] <phogg> yeah, some perl
[15:43:38] <PaulFertser> That's because git hackers are using what they're already familiar with. Not because shell is nice.
[15:44:04] <phogg> when I write little utils for use with git I try to keep it to sh or bash, or other things everyone certainly has (even on Windows)

[15:45:07] <phogg> it's frightening how long 'git rebase' was a shell script
[15:45:09] <PaulFertser> phogg: why bash though? Many people prefer zsh or fish or powershell. You should only assume POSIX-shell to be available as /bin/sh ;)
[15:45:33] <phogg> PaulFertser: bash is everywhere and a far superior choice for scripting than zsh or fish
[15:45:36] <n4dir> probably because you can assume bash is installed
[15:45:48] <phogg> I don't do POSIX sh unless *required*, because it's unpleasant

[15:46:35] <phogg> PaulFertser: anyway, fish is too rare to even consider. As for zsh *most* bash scripts also work in zsh, because it tries to be compatible, but the reverse is not true.
[15:46:45] <n4dir> what is debian minbase?
[15:46:57] <PaulFertser> phogg: my point is that I can imagine how one has dash and fish but not bash.
[15:47:04] <phogg> as for powershell... it's a worse story than fish!
[15:47:14] <phogg> PaulFertser: I can't imagine fish but not bash
[15:47:15] <PaulFertser> n4dir: when you do Debian debootstrap install you can choose a variant.
[15:47:26] <phogg> PaulFertser: dash but not bash can happen, of course
[15:47:37] <phogg> you never write bashisms and use #!/bin/sh, that's irresponsible
[15:47:44] <PaulFertser> 100 % ack
[15:47:54] <n4dir> wonders if it is worth to do a quick debootstrap

[21:07:56] <nyash> Hi. I have a server that establishes PPPoE tunnels. It is also configured to rename interfaces when they are created. So I get for example: 'kernel: [53147.883353] ppp447: renamed from customname447' in /var/log/syslog. That's ok. But I also get: 'systemd-udevd[34960]: ethtool: autonegotiation is unset or enabled, the speed and duplex are not writable' when an interface is created/renamed. I browsed /lib/udev/ and /etc/udev folders for any rules but I can't
[21:07:56] <nyash> find anything referencing ethtool. Where these messages might be coming from and how to disable them?

[22:25:51] <madprops> it does
[22:25:54] <ayecee> and because if it does look that way, then there's a constant low level of traffic in updating that bar that would keep the ssh session from timing out
