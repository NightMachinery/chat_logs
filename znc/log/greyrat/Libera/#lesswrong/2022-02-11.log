[00:01:43] <ggreer> also NHTSA requires that all tesla owners get mailed a letter about this "recall". what a stupid situation
[00:02:04] <spxtr> what sounds can teslas make with this boombox feature?
[00:02:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> I approve of this
[00:02:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> There should not be any "fun sounds"
[00:02:51] <ggreer> any sound. you plug in a usb stick and can select whatever you want
[00:02:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow
[00:03:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is terrible and I am 100% in favor of banning it
[00:03:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And shaming Tesla for it
[00:03:34] <ggreer> by default teslas make a jetsons-like sound
[00:03:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> They should ban that too
[00:03:51] <ggreer> but the boombox feature ships with ice cream truck, coconut clopping from monty python & the holy grail, snake jazz, and polynesian elevator music
[00:03:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Only standard-issue car honks. Nothing else
[00:04:08] <ggreer> it's not for honking. it's for rolling around at low speeds
[00:04:22] <spxtr> haha, those are pretty funny tbh. I would laugh if I heard a tesla coconut clopping by
[00:04:24] <ggreer> NHTSA requires that EVs make noise at low speeds
[00:04:56] <spxtr> funny aside, seems pretty terrible to allow user-supplied sounds.
[00:05:06] <ggreer> IIRC there are certain requirements about decibel minimums, but that's it
[00:05:18] <spxtr> I was just about to ask if it could be silent
[00:05:53] <ggreer> I think the tesla normalizes the sound file so that even if you tried to make it quiet, it'd amplify the noise
[00:10:12] <spxtr> is the PWS sound that high-pitched whine?
[00:10:26] <ggreer> it's not super high pitched, but it's sort of a whine, yeah
[00:10:56] <kuudes> ... if you give it a wav from /dev/zero, what does it say
[00:11:00] <gwern> yakkety-sax would surely be an improvement over whine
[00:12:23] <ggreer> all the recent updates to my car have made it worse, and it's all because of government bullshit. it's more paranoid about detecting if your hands are on the wheel. they disabled games for the passenger. now they're killing the boombox feature
[00:12:25] <kuudes> Obormot\Arcturus, cars are now required per law to make motor sounds
[00:12:55] <ggreer> the only real improvements have been remote monitoring of cameras in sentry mode and the robocop voice that you can use in sentry mode
[00:13:58] <ggreer> I can't wait for some privacy scandal to happen and for the NHTSA to require that tesla disable sentry mode or something
[00:16:26] <adiabatic> the boombox feature sounds great when it's just one or two cars but sounds awful when it's, like, half the cars around
[00:21:17] <ggreer> if half the cars around are making the same jetsons whine, people will just tune it out and get run over
[00:21:35] <adiabatic> blind people will stay tuned in
[00:21:57] <adiabatic> but if you have one coconut clopper, and one ice cream truck, and one snake jazz, and one polynesian elevator music…
[00:22:12] <adiabatic> that's a lot of different sounds to mentally keep track of and think "actually a car"
[00:23:50] <ggreer> different car manufacturers have different sounds already. hell, different countries have different requirements about which sounds to make so it's not even standard across the west
[00:24:10] <kuudes> iirc they are based on a common standard
[00:24:14] <ggreer> the optimal number of blind and/or oblivious people who get run over is not zero
[00:24:53] *** Quits: Filipepe (~Filipepe@2804:14d:5ca3:8ebe:807b:788a:2cff:ff15) (Quit: Client closed)
[00:26:43] <ggreer> I'm honestly not sure if net harm is minimized by requiring EVs to make sound at low speeds. at 20mph or so, cars make plenty of noise from the tires rolling. at lower speeds, getting hit by a car is not very deadly. but *everyone* gets distracted or annoyed by the backup sounds
[00:28:33] <adiabatic> the optimal number of clued-in blind people who get run over is probably close to zero
[00:28:53] <adiabatic> if not zero
[00:29:16] <spxtr> I mean, not *exactly* zero, but I expect my optimal number to be much closer to zero than ggreer's
[00:29:56] <spxtr> if exactly zero then you have to outright ban all cars, of course.

[00:37:01] <ggreer> the horn is separate from the pedestrian warning speaker so disabling the PWS seems like the best option

[00:42:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[00:42:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man that's a weird case
[00:43:13] <gwern> it's because I'm attempting to overload the archive/original functionality to handle 3 versions of a URL
[00:43:14] <ggreer> https://www.tesla.com/blog/dfehs-misguided-lawsuit huh
[00:43:14] <Robomot> The DFEH’s Misguided Lawsuit | Tesla (The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) intends to file a lawsuit against Tesla alleging systematic racial discrimination and harassment. This follows a three-year investigation during which the DFEH—whose mission is supposedly to protect workers—has never once raised any concern about current workplace practices at Tesla. Rather, the lawsuit …)
[00:43:45] <ggreer> > Over the past five years, the DFEH has been asked on almost 50 occasions by individuals who believe they were discriminated against or harassed to investigate Tesla. On every single occasion, when the DFEH closed an investigation, it did not find misconduct against Tesla. It therefore strains credibility for the agency to now allege, after a three-year investigation, that systematic racial discrimination and harassment somehow 
[00:43:45] <ggreer> existed at Tesla.
[00:45:59] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I think the regexp rewrite could be inserted at L192 of annotations.js, '+ fixedEncodeURIComponent(fixedEncodeURIComponent(annotationIdentifier))'
[00:46:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> no
[00:46:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So the definitive solution (and the desired functionality) would be for a link to have an immutable unique identifier string (whether that string is actually stored with the link as a data attribute or constructed via some *deterministic* process) ... currently the JS *assumes* that this is the case, but in fact the code that constructs that identifier is no longer correct, due to the change
[00:46:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> The modification for now should therefore be to the Extracts.targetIdentifier function, which I am modifying as we speak

[01:59:59] <quanticle> which less radical supporters of a movement reinterpret and contextualize the most radical claims of a movement in order to make it more palatable to themselves. The example used in the post is how "Defund the Police" was recontextualized, but I'm sure you can think of other examples.

[02:05:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> I gotta be honest, the first thing I think of when I see that is that one Al Stewart song
[02:05:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> "We all sailed off together on this sorry ship of state..."
[02:05:54] <gwern> kuudes: and I can't really blame them. I mean, arithmetic? rhyming poetry? no one really gives a toss about those
[02:06:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> (That story does not end well for the narrator or, for that matter, the ship)
[02:06:19] <gwern> 'oh no our model can't do anagrams. but it can do meta-learning!'
[02:06:30] <saturn2> let's not go to /r/neoliberal, 'tis a silly place
[02:06:36] <kuudes> I guess for english it works well enough?
[02:06:40] <rmmh> "does gpt have dyslexia?" 
[02:06:42] <quanticle> saturn2: Agreed!
[02:06:49] <gwern> really, the problem is when people say, 'I refuse to learn anything about BPEs; also, GPT-3 can't do arithmetic, checkmate DL enthusiasts!'
[02:07:32] <gwern> seriously the number of people who think that the arithmetic performance says anything at all about transformers or scaling or gpt-3 rather than being determined by BPEs...
[02:07:37] <kuudes> I guess if one would actually aim to produce a local gpt for something useful other than pushing frontier, one could want to prefer chars?
[02:07:38] <rmmh> I know enough about BPEs to be mildly susprised when it handles case conversions or emphasis by stretching a vowel 
[02:08:23] <gwern> that's probably the major gain of discarding BPEs. it'll just be more consistent in performance and people will stop being fooled/getting excuses from the special-cases
[02:08:26] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: And re: sanewashing being Geeks/MOPs/psychopaths for politics, yeah, that essay on the /r/antiwork meltdown makes that same point, and links to Status 451's essay on it: https://status451.com/2016/09/15/social-gentrification/
[02:08:27] <Robomot> Social Gentrification | Status 451 (Earlier this week a friend of mine was talking about nerd culture, and was surprised when I mentioned that I don’t like it. I avoid nerd culture and, despite being the exact target demographi…)

[02:09:05] * gwern wouldn't be surprised if some of the other tasks that Transformers aren't scaling well on might be partially due to hidden BPE sabotage

[02:09:22] <Robomot> Al Stewart - Joe the Georgian - YouTube (00:03:32) (From "Between the Wars")
[02:12:01] <gwern> 'The New Yorker interviewed the author of the looting book, the interviewer was pretty good about pushing back especially in the end:   "Should I throw in a link to your book in the intro, or do you want to encourage people to go take it for free from their local bookstore?"'
[02:12:42] <gwern> her answer is 'You can include a link if you like. No problem. People should support their local bookstores. If they go to bookshop.org, they’ll support local bookstores that way. I just want people to read it. That’s what I want people to know. I want them to read it, however they get it.'

[02:25:36] <rmmh> I'm not convinced finnish stats mean anything to the rest of the world, really
[02:25:53] <rmmh> finland having eugenic birth regime is an anomaly
[02:26:51] <kuudes> unsure. it seems usa might be the anomaly more. but hard to say
[02:26:58] <gwern> more educated women being more fertile seems pretty anomalous
[02:27:30] <cpopell> still curious to see if we'll see fertility selected for again
[02:27:38] <kuudes> unsure if it is different in rest of nordics
[02:30:55] <kuudes> yeah, seems similar in other nordics https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6639448/
[02:30:55] <Robomot> Education, Gender, and Cohort Fertility in the Nordic Countries - PMC (Systematic comparisons of fertility developments based on education, gender and country context are rare. Using harmonized register data, we compare cohort total fertility and ultimate childlessness by gender and educational attainment for cohorts born ...)
[02:32:03] <kuudes> "Women’s negative educational gradient in relation to total fertility has vanished, except in Finland, while men’s positive gradient has persisted. The highest level of men’s childlessness appears among the least educated. In the oldest female cohorts, childlessness was highest among the highly educated, but these patterns have changed over the cohorts as childlessness has increased among the low educated and remained relatively stable among h
[02:32:03] <kuudes> igher educated women. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, childlessness is now highest among the least educated women. We witness both a new gender similarity and persistent (among men) and new (among women) educational disparities in childbearing outcomes in the Nordic region."
[02:32:27] <kuudes> I wonder if that is related to the J-curve upturn of fertility when hdi increases enough

[02:41:20] <kuudes> like, 3+
[02:41:47] <gwern> (something the sociologists should do, some of that 'qualitative' research they're so fond of - go around and interview a lot of lower-class women in finland and america and ask why the former don't have kids and the latter do when in terms of easiness and resources it should be the other way around)
[02:42:07] <kuudes> I wonder to what extent us kids are result of low contraception education
[02:42:19] <gwern> (bleh. arxiv blocked me.  even with like 30s between PDFs)
[02:42:54] <kuudes> btw maybe you should trial those changes first from some other ip than gwern.net?
[02:43:34] <kuudes> but I mean, I am in the understanding that large part of us population do not know how contraceptives work
[02:44:05] <kuudes> and or can't afford contraception? O_o
[02:44:42] <gwern> I'm not sure about that. when you read about single mothers, an awful lot of them have a line somewhere about 'I "forgot" the contraception' or 'we didn't plan it but we didn't not plan it either'

[02:46:03] <PlanckWalk> zebrask: You can't really ask about "descendants of the world in which you press the button".  Quantum uncertainty doesn't work like that.  At best you can ask about conditional probaiblities over *all* worlds in which you press the button.

[02:51:38] <zebrask> PlanckWalk: I don't understand what you mean by that.
[02:52:44] <PlanckWalk> There isn't just one "state of the world in which you press the button"
[02:53:18] <PlanckWalk> MWI is not a tree.
[02:53:25] <zebrask> Well yeah, otherwise it would only be one outcome of pushing the button.
[02:54:11] <zebrask> What do you mean it's not a tree?
[02:54:47] <kuudes> gwern, btw how is it in more and less developed states or counties in usa?
[02:55:06] <kuudes> if it is a hdi issue, it should show in interstate or intercounty stats
[02:55:09] <gwern> I dunno. that sounds complicated conceptually - educated people migrate
[02:55:22] <PlanckWalk> I mean that the structure doesn't proceed from single states to a probability distribution over multiple states.
[02:55:59] <PlanckWalk> You can work the math that way in some idealized situations, but usually if the very special conditions don't hold, you will get the wrong answers.
[02:58:20] <zebrask> I don't understand what part you are objecting to. The part that there multiple states? The part where each state is the consequence of the evolution of earlier states?
[02:58:30] <zebrask> Or that it's a probability distribution?

[03:05:24] <kuudes> I have been thinking; shouldn't nato start to plan for regime change in russia?
[03:07:54] <cpopell> why the fuck would they do that. there's no reason to believe it would be successful.
[03:08:16] <cpopell> that seems like a giant multi-trillion dollar black hole of 'getting your own regime overthrown domestically'
[03:09:02] <saturn2> putin is already the result of a western regime change effort
[03:09:05] <ggreer> putin is almost 70? he's aged well
[03:10:04] <kuudes> it seems to me that putin regime is getting a tad hostile
[03:10:24] <ggreer> sure, but never get involved in a land war in asia
[03:10:46] <PlanckWalk> zebrask: The state at any moment can be viewed as a continuous complex-valued distribution. It's possible to look only at a subset of that distribution and consider the evolution over time, but you need an asusmption that the contributions of the neglected part of the state space sum to zero.
[03:10:48] <kuudes> yes, but moscow is in europe
[03:12:01] <ggreer> nobody has ever successfully invaded russia. napoleon couldn't do it. hitler couldn't do it. I seriously doubt the situation is easier today now that russia has nukes
[03:12:09] <kuudes> saturn2, well, to an extent, but not directly. yeltsin was possibly sort of directly, putin appeared later
[03:12:22] <kuudes> ggreer, who said anything about invading
[03:12:39] <PlanckWalk> (Technically they can sum to something large so long as the contribution is orthogonal, but this almost never happens)
[03:12:55] <kuudes> somehow gorbachev was no longer a leader of a country suddenly
[03:13:14] <zebrask> PlanckWalk: That doesn't really clarify anything.
[03:13:18] <PlanckWalk> Oh.
[03:15:43] <saturn2> kuudes: it doesn't matter whether it's directly or indirectly, the result is the result. unless you're proposing a permanent occupation government this time
[03:16:09] <nshepperd> just nuke Moscow from orbit and see what happens
[03:16:26] <zebrask> Like, the essential elements are that I experience some state or slice of state space. The part of the universe representing me evolves into other states where state A is a part of their history. Usually that involves further splitting into subspaces with unique histories from one another.
[03:16:51] <PlanckWalk> Hmmm.  Basically at any time there are many states that are perceptually identical.  If the situation is really "clean" then you can pick one "representative" state and consider only that one.  This technically involves ignoring infinitely many states, but in a suitable situation the rest cancel out.
[03:17:57] <PlanckWalk> Situations like pressing a button to sample /dev/urandom are not clean in this sense.
[03:18:57] <zebrask> I don't think it matters? From my perspective I'm either experiencing one tiny slice or many slices or a thick band of slices.
[03:19:03] <PlanckWalk> You can't just pick one representative state and follow it along to say what the conditional probabilities of the outcomes are.
[03:19:21] <kuudes> saturn2, well, 90s was nice
[03:19:23] <PlanckWalk> There are complex interference between "nearby" states
[03:19:32] <kuudes> so, once per 20 years would do it?
[03:19:59] <PlanckWalk> So it makes no sense to say "at the moment you push the button, the bits have a certain definite quantum value"
[03:20:09] <zebrask> But 1 day later there are a bunch of states where being in the state I was experiencing at point 0 is in my world's history / memory, and all of those are point 0's descendants.
[03:20:17] <PlanckWalk> Nope
[03:20:28] <PlanckWalk> There is *no single state* 0.
[03:20:34] <quanticle> ggreer: It's true that no one has successfully invaded Russia, but let's also not forget that the last unsuccessful attempt to invade Russia cost the Russians 20 million lives.
[03:20:40] <zebrask> There is, by definition.
[03:20:46] <saturn2> it would probably be more humane to just nuke them all than to make them relive the 90s forever
[03:20:49] <PlanckWalk> I just explained why not.
[03:21:24] <zebrask> Well you cannot explain why a definition is not true, just why it's not useful.
[03:21:47] <PlanckWalk> I am explaining why your definition is not useful.
[03:22:18] <zebrask> Not very effectively. This feels like nitpicking for its own sake.
[03:22:21] <PlanckWalk> Yes, you can try to take a representative point in the state space.  You will get the wrong results.
[03:23:13] <PlanckWalk> It's not nitpicking because it has a direct bearing on your original question.
[03:23:51] <zebrask> What bearing does it have?
[03:24:33] <PlanckWalk> Unless you take great pains to isolate the quantum behaviour of your source, the weightings of the assignments of the participants will be proportional to the classical probabilities.
[03:26:32] <PlanckWalk> If you did isolate the source to have quantum coherence with your button-pressing, then you might end up with a difference, but this doesn't happen in practice.
[03:27:23] <zebrask> From the perspective of someone participating in a clinical trial, the question is whether they can assume that the entities that feel like they have a continuous conscious experience starting with deciding full participate in a clinical trial will evolve into a statistically representative set of entities with all the outcomes or whether the "classical" nature of the PRNG will give a skewed distribution in some direction.
[03:28:07] <PlanckWalk> This is why classical probability is such a great approximation to quantum probability in practice, *except* when things are carefully enough controlled that coherence effects are visible.

[03:28:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmmmm.
[03:31:43] <PlanckWalk> zebrask: If it truly was only a PRNG, then you can certainly get a skewed distribution.
[03:31:57] <PlanckWalk> But sources like /dev/urandom are not just PRNGs.
[03:32:31] <PlanckWalk> Their output is (in a quantum sense) strongly coupled with the history of the world.
[03:32:43] <PlanckWalk> In a decoherent manner
[03:32:53] <zebrask> Yes, but it's deterministic.
[03:32:55] <PlanckWalk> No
[03:33:25] <PlanckWalk> Well, yes in the sense that *everything* in quantum theory is deterministic since the state evolution function is.
[03:33:30] <PlanckWalk> But not in any useful sense.
[03:33:56] *** Quits: _inky (inky_@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/inky) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[03:34:08] <zebrask> The question is whether ensemble statistics converge or diverge I think.
[03:35:16] <zebrask> If the state of the PRNG seed is drawn from processes that are insensitive to initial conditions, the outcomes are more limited than the state being chaotic.
[03:35:53] <PlanckWalk> In practice the PRNG seed stream is highly sensitive to earlier conditions.
[03:36:02] <zebrask> Because the "randomness" from quantum mechanics either averages away or multiplies until you have some ergodic sampling of all possible PRNG states.
[03:36:27] <PlanckWalk> (by design)
[03:37:56] <zebrask> From what I can tell it depends on mouse movements, keyboard timings, probably the actual time and "IDE timings" - not sure what that is.
[03:38:12] <PlanckWalk> In practice any given ensemble of "you pressing the button" will have a very broad distribution across stream outputs.
[03:38:47] <PlanckWalk> IDE is a hard disk interface
[03:38:56] <zebrask> Stuff like sampling the low bits of thermal noise seems like it would be more likely to be a uniform distribution of states, though obviously any small entropy gets magnified anyway.
[03:39:05] <PlanckWalk> Yes, and that gets fed in too
[03:39:19] <zebrask> I think it does in some systems but not others.
[03:39:48] <PlanckWalk> But even then effects of thermal noise affect many of the other sources
[03:44:22] <PlanckWalk> At any rate, the *quantum* correlation is essentially zero
[03:44:41] <PlanckWalk> The classical approximation is perfectly adequate.

[03:53:14] <quanticle> >Well, yes in the sense that *everything* in quantum theory is deterministic
[03:53:16] <quanticle> Huh? Are you using the word "deterministic" in a different way? A single given outcome of a random trial is not deterministic, even though the overall distribution of outcomes may be known ahead of time.
[03:53:18] <quanticle> Quantum theory gives you the distribution. It does not give you the outcome of specific trials.
[03:53:46] <PlanckWalk> quanticle: From a certain point of view, the state function is all there is.
[03:54:18] <PlanckWalk> There are no "specific trials", there are just regions of the state function.
[03:54:47] <quanticle> Okay? But doesn't that defeat the argument that quantum theory is "deterministic"?
[03:55:20] <PlanckWalk> As I said earlier, "But not in any useful sense."
[03:55:26] <quanticle> Ah, okay.
[03:55:28] <quanticle> Fair
[03:55:37] <PlanckWalk> No, since all the outcomes happen.  "We" just don't see them all.

[04:22:36] <nshepperd> ggreer: haha, the Android version lets you turn those off
[04:23:04] <nshepperd> i deleted Lyft way back when it was first a thing for exactly that reason though
[04:23:33] <ggreer> nshepperd: you can turn off all uber notifications except the "your driver is arriving" ones?
[04:23:39] <nshepperd> yeah
[04:23:46] <ggreer> neat
[04:24:36] <quanticle> Yeah, Android has much finer grained notification channels, and, oddly enough, companies tend to actually use them.

[04:25:08] <quanticle> Even though there's nothing at the OS level stopping you from just having a single channel for all your notifications, giving the user only a binary choice.
[04:26:04] <adiabatic> ggreer: it's structured a bit differently on the iOS app but it's still kind of there
[04:26:15] <nshepperd> yeah, i assume it's google applying some sort of pressure via the app store
[04:26:31] <nshepperd> The only good thing google has done with Android in 5 years
[04:27:18] <ggreer> I'm surprised apple doesn't push back on that. they added all kinds of different focus modes and differentiate between notifications and "time sensitive notifications"
[04:27:29] <ggreer> but all of uber's notifications are marked as "time sensitive"
[04:28:37] <ggreer> one neat thing that has improved: I can use my phone/watch to pay for bus fares. it was a little tricky to set up, but once you have an account it just works
[04:30:13] <nshepperd> yeah it's useless to have a category for "time sensitive" or "important" stuff because of course the assholes who make the app think everything's important
[04:30:22] <adiabatic> well, that's interesting. There are three black-owned restaurants Near Me, according to Uber Eats. One of them is a Chinese place.
[04:30:41] <nshepperd> they have to be categorised by what they're about so the user can decide
[04:31:03] <ggreer> heh. I assume most places just lie about that so they can get more business
[04:32:23] <ggreer> best-case it's like the black-owned weed stores in oakland
[04:33:05] <adiabatic> black-owned chinese noodle shop with hanzi in the place name…hmmmmm

[04:57:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It occurred to me that the proper way to formulate the divergence between "value of `data-url-original` attribute" and "proper target identifier" that we encountered in the ar5iv case is "the content was served by and retrieved from URL X, and is properly associated with and identified by URL X, but we are linking to it via URL Y for reasons (convenience or who knows what)"
[04:58:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Formulated thus, it occurs to me to wonder if there are already other such cases, perhaps?
[04:59:03] <gwern> there could've been. like mobile or https English Wikipedia *used* to need a rewrite and you might want such a triplet
[04:59:28] <gwern> biorxiv/medriv with their '.full' extension would've been one but that was more easily solved by just auto-rewriting the URLs inside the markdown source
[05:00:03] <gwern> (biorxiv/medriv don't have the html fulltext *immediately* but they just redirect to the abstract in such cases, so you can just tack on '.full' and everything is fine)
[05:00:43] <gwern> greaterwrong is a case, I guess
[05:05:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Do you actually have local archives of LW pages? Aren't LW links just presented as a foreign site embed (since it's one of the few sites that plays well in a frame)?
[05:05:22] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I link LW. it gets rewritten to GW and then live-popped up
[05:05:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[05:05:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that's then not the same thing
[05:05:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, a pattern to watch out for, when local-archiving, is my point
[05:05:51] <gwern> so the popups are similarly rewriting the link on the fly because they 'know' that the URL is bad
[05:06:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> (to watch out for so that we can add additional special cases, if need be, I mean)

[08:51:45] <gwern> it's just another hacky specialcase, is all, that makes me reluctant
[08:52:12] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: do you know of any architecture that has shown a steeper pexplexity-parameter relationship than self-attention? If not, I do not think an other architecture will replace self-attention. There will be no "possible future Bitter Lesson" as you put it in your notes/FC/
[08:52:19] <gwern> sure I could easily do a quick string infix or regexp check in the bit of the JS which does the [LIVE] substituition, I've messed with it before, but...
[08:52:41] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: there are all sorts of exotic architectures which trade off parameters and runtime computation
[08:53:18] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, so it isn't just parameter. It is all three: parameters, runtime compute, and data
[08:53:46] <PapuaHardyNet> but as of right now, am I correct in stating that self-attention is the frontier of scaling and we haven't found anything better yet?
[08:53:56] <gwern> it's all space-time tradeoffs. AIXI is at one extreme, and the Giant Lookup Table of Doom is at the other
[08:54:42] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, I see. So there's no "pushing the frontier", it is literally just space-time tradeoffs where we are relying more and more on compute due to the Moore's Law
[08:55:16] <gwern> nah, I think self-attention is valuable because it works better, not because it happens to slide along a pareto frontier
[08:55:32] <gwern> you can burn more compute on RNNs, for example, doesn't make them better in practice
[08:55:53] <gwern> even self-attention can be more expensive if you want it to be. in the hopfield isomorphism, self-attention is a single iteration. why not more?
[08:57:26] <gwern> it's a tricky question. after all, the scaling laws on transformers and MLPs generally all look pretty damn similar in the exponent
[08:57:34] <PapuaHardyNet> so there are better architectures that aren't just space-time tradeoffs. There are exotic architectures right now that use tradeoffs to have steeper perplexity-parameter relationships, but they aren't "truly better".
[08:57:45] <PapuaHardyNet> MLPs also follow power law? huh.
[08:58:12] <PapuaHardyNet> What would be amazing is finding a logarithmic relationship between perplexity and compute/data/params. That would change everything
[08:58:14] <gwern> yeah, IIRC it was in one of the scaling law papers last year, they benchmarked some MLPs. the MLPs were pretty equivalent to the transformers
[08:58:37] <gwern> which is very much a glass half-full empty sort of thing
[08:58:38] <PapuaHardyNet> sweet, I need to read that paper. Any hints as to how I can find it?
[08:59:18] <gwern> if you're a MLP enthusiast, you can appeal to the bitter lesson: MLPs are simple and dense and uniform and that will outcompete Transformers in the end; if you're a transformer enthusiast, it shows MLP has no advantages now worth caring about and transformers often do better
[08:59:46] <gwern> it's probably in /r/mlscaling? I dunno if it made it from a tab to a submission
[08:59:56] <PapuaHardyNet> I'll go through /r/mlscaling, thanks. 
[09:00:25] <PapuaHardyNet> but yeah, there's no clear way to claim MLPs should be used instead of transformers. I can claim that they have similar perf and have a simpler arch, but that's about it.
[09:01:02] <gwern> https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07686 argues that we can get much better exponents

[09:01:39] <gwern> MLPs should be more linear in context/history, so that might be a way to win. skip the n^2
[09:01:57] <gwern> a victory on LRA would draw attention
[09:02:16] <nshepperd2> or much worse exponents, depending on your perspective

[09:07:00] <gwern> (if nothing else, MLP work should give a better idea of what self-attention is actually good for. the fact that they work so well shows that self-attention wasn't all that important for what transformers accomplish. so what are they good for, if anything?)

[09:09:25] <PapuaHardyNet> the gMLPs paper shows that self-attention / Transformers performed much better on BERT's next sentence prediction as compared to gMLPs of the same size, but when a tiny self-attention mechanism was added to the gMLP layers, the gMLPs again outperformed Transformers

[18:05:47] <gwern> if you save using something like singlefile, it serializes the DOM, so you can edit pages with ublock like that. that's how I do many of mine
[18:07:59] <PapuaHardyNet> that should be the default "save file" method for browser
[18:08:04] <PapuaHardyNet> any browser*
[18:10:55] <pie_> hell yeah, ublock has some sort of remove operator
[18:11:27] <pie_> the problem was that ublock hides things instead of actually removing the element, at least the way I was doing it

[21:05:27] <gwern> ggreer: 'Some states, including New York, where we live, have laws criminalizing this sort of thing. Not wanting to break the law, or my husband’s trust, I had asked him for permission...“You can do it,” he said. “But it’ll be boring. We’re in a pandemic. I never go anywhere.”'
[21:06:18] <pompolic> there's a whole ass cottage industry of "family tracker" apps
[21:06:42] <gwern> 'Within two hours of my putting all the trackers in our car, my husband, who has an iPhone, got an alert about the AirTag, after running an errand. The problem was that he couldn’t find it. The alert said he could make the AirTag play a sound, but when he attempted to do so, his phone wouldn’t connect to the device. This happened multiple times, and he started to get frustrated. “Is it...
[21:06:48] <gwern> ...in my shoe?” he asked me at one point, taking his blue Nike off and peering at it. “You have to tell me. I don’t want to destroy my shoe looking for it.” The one time his iPhone connected to the AirTag in the car, so he could play the noise, it was so hard to tell where it was coming from that he gave up looking for it after five minutes. The critics were right: Apple’s...
[21:06:54] <gwern> ...safeguards against nefarious use weren’t foolproof. Apple itself has realized the inadequacy of its safeguards and announced improvements this week, including making the devices louder and telling AirTag users that tracking someone without consent is a crime. My husband, of course, had agreed to this in principle, but didn’t realize just how many devices I had planted on him. Of the...
[21:07:00] <gwern> ...seven trackers, he found only two: a Tile he felt in the breast pocket of his coat and an AirTag in his backpack when he was looking for something else. “It is impossible to find a device that makes no noise and gives no warning,” he said, when I showed him the ones he missed.' hehe

That ejection arrived at Earth sometime around Feb. 2, creating a geomagnetic storm in Earth’s magnetic bubble.
[21:22:01] <two2thehead> "The powerful storm added kinetic energy to particles in Earth’s atmosphere. “The atmosphere kind of puffs up, expands, as a result,” Dr. Lewis said. That expansion causes an increase in the atmosphere’s density, which in turn increases the drag experienced by objects moving through it, including satellites. This drag shrinks the size of their orbits, which draws them closer to the thick, lower atmosphere in which they burn up."

[22:52:52] <pompolic> world powers: do an invasion, do an invasion
[22:54:25] <kuudes> gwern, so, your odds for russia attacking 1) tonight or 2) before monday?
[22:55:07] <gwern> I don't have a good feel for that. a military is a huge thing and an invasion is an immense logistical operation
[22:55:09] <two2thehead> kuudes, make a prediction https://predictionbook.com/predictions/207031
[22:55:09] <Robomot> PredictionBook: [ Geopolitics , Military ] Russia attacks Ukraine even further within 100 (one hundred) days
[22:55:38] <gwern> I don't actually know if it's even possible for an invasion to begin within a day or three of putin phoning up whoever runs the russian military and saying, 'go'
[22:56:03] <gwern> 'next week' strongly implies either sunday or monday, after all and today is friday
[22:57:02] <gwern> so, since you'd expect US sigint and humint to be able to hear an invasion order shortly after it's given and it begins percolating through tens of thousands of people and all their electronic gizmos, and everyone is going to freak out as soon as the spies confirm it, Putin may have only given the order literally hours ago
[22:57:03] <kuudes> wait, what said next week?
[22:57:27] <gwern> second tweet: 'The US expects the invasion to begin next week, six US and Western officials tell me, as Secretary of State Antony @SecBlinken said last night.'
[22:57:49] <kuudes> ah, thanks
[22:58:13] <gwern> so it sounds like blinken might be saying that based on the presumed intercepted orders/chatter, in which case putin may have given the order like, yesterday afternoon
[22:58:55] <gwern> in which case if the invasion officially starts on sunday, means Thursday afternoon - Sunday morning or maybe 3 days. based on what I know of militaries, that sounds pretty darn fast
[22:59:47] <gwern> so if russia 'invades' today or tomorrow, that suggests that the order took a lot longer than I think to get intercepted and conveyed up to secstate despite the extreme urgency and priority, or the russian military really is so mobile and fast that it can invade in like 1-2 days

They didn’t like the cover to Mort—the fourth Discworld novel—for some reason, so instead they used the cover for the next book in the series, Wyrd Sisters. … Mort is a book about Death’s apprentice, and Wyrd Sisters is a Shakespeare parody about
[23:23:59] <feepbot> witches. There are basically no witches in Mort—there’s a witch, briefly. It’s clearly the cover of a completely different book. Then of course they’ve got to publish the next book, which is Wyrd Sisters, and they need a new cover for that, so they just use it again. So there’s two Discworld novels in the ’90s German production that have exactly the same cover.'

Businesses are experimenting with all kinds of well-being measures to entice new staff: In January, Pinterest bulked up its fertility benefits and parental leave; in December, fintech company Finder introduced an extra five days on top of

[23:29:45] <feep> fertility benefits...
[23:29:52] <feep> wat
[23:30:33] <kuudes> hmm. I wonder if I should ask for more vacation rather than salary? O_o
[23:30:44] <Betawolf> benefits for being fertile, but you have to prove it.
[23:31:02] <feep> breeder leave
[23:31:26] <kuudes> well, parental leaves sort of are that. but that feels a rather impolite way to say that?
[23:31:43] <feep> no like, pre-parental leave
[23:31:45] <Betawolf> It says parental leave already, so fertility benefits must be something else.

[23:41:39] <pompolic> one i remember was trying to build a mental map of the route the car i was in took, from proprioception

[23:45:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the ACX post about heuristics:
[23:45:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The security guard example is particularly bad because having a security guard just sit there, even if they do nothing, is a decent deterrent.  That's almost all of the job of a security guard.  I know, I hired a security guard, they do literally nothing, and they solved homeless people wandering into our parking lot and stealing from cars completely and instantly."
[23:50:12] <gwern> feep: oh, I see, they meant 'furtility benefits'. an easy oversight
[23:55:12] <feepbot> <gwern> https://twitter.com/juliaioffe/status/1492221319102013442 welp. that clinches it, the bien pensant don't believe it, so it's definitely true
[23:55:14] <Robomot> Julia Ioffe (@juliaioffe): "Source in Moscow tells me that they don't believe the current news precisely because it comes from U.S. intelligence. "What if it's yet another intelligence error?" the source said, adding that nothing in the fundamentals has changed that would make an invasion more likely."

[23:56:47] <gwern> "putin gave the order and it will have begun next week" is super-specific and PBS ascribed it to like 4 officials. that's not something that gets made up out of whole cloth
[23:58:38] <pompolic> don't liars use specious detail for credibility?
[23:59:03] <pompolic> specious might be the wrong word 
[23:59:44] <saturn2> how many times have they predicted invasion before?
