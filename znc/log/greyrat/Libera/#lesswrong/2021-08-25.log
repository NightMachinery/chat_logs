[00:04:52] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Speaking of which, there‚Äôs a famous This American Life episode from 2002 where the public radio journos actually test their own testosterone levels. The big joke of the episode is just how comically low their T levels are. Sure, you would stereotype bookish public radio men in this way, and yet the results are on the nose enough to shock. As a nerdy media-weakling type,
[00:04:52] <feepbot> I can relate to the stunning realization that you‚Äôve been largely living apart from T. Before working in the NBA setting, I was an intern in the cubicles of Salon.com‚Äôs San Francisco office, around the time it was shifting from respectable online magazine into inane outrage content mill. Going from that setting to the NBA locker room was some jarring whiplash, like leaving the
[00:04:52] <feepbot> faculty lounge for a pirate ship. To quote Charles Barkley on the latter culture, ‚ÄúThe locker room is sexist, racist, and homophobic ‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs fun and I miss it.‚Äù The NBA world conversations were loud, rude and hilarious, without regard to sensitivities, absent the competing empathies that obsessed Salon‚Äôs writers. After big games, you could sense that cathartic release
[00:04:57] <feepbot> of adrenaline in the air, as large men bellowed and talked their shit. You could get bullied out of nowhere. What are you wearing? Did your mom pick that out? A buddy who worked for a team told me that Shaquille O'Neal had a tendency to get naked, tackle the team trainer and mock hump the poor guy.'

Today, Nike is something else. It LARPs as a grandiose feminist nonprofit as it floats

[00:42:44] * gwern wonders what people do for 'brown m&m tests' now that the brown m&m thing is so well known
[00:44:48] <ggreer> you can't buy m&ms without the brown ones, so it should still work, right?
[00:46:27] <gwern> ggreer: yes, but the problem is people *know* about it, so they *know* it's a specific test of them and a litmus test which would be shameful and embarassing to fail
[00:46:44] <gwern> it's no longer a 'mystery shopper' of the setup requirements
[00:46:47] <ggreer> ah yeah the correlation isn't as strong
[00:47:04] <gwern> one needs very little diligence to do the one thing you know they will be checking
[00:48:03] <gwern> before, the brown m&m would be about the last thing one does; so the m&ms being brown verifies that all higher priority items were probably done; once they know about the brown m&m test, though, then it goes right to the top of the list of priorities, and verifies nothing about the rest
[00:50:18] <gwern> the m&m test is a pretty good one, because you know that m&ms are available to purchase everywhere, it doesn't look like a test (weirdo food preferences among prima donnas are well known), and it rather purely loads on tediousness and a human sorting m&ms by hand rather than simply buying a more expensive bag of m&ms or having some other time/effort-saving trick
[00:50:50] <kuudes> what is brown m&m test?
[00:51:25] <gwern> https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brown-out/
[00:51:26] <Robomot> Did Van Halen's Concert Contract Require the Removal of Brown M&Ms? | Snopes.com (Did Van Halen's contract call for the removal of all brown M&Ms from bowls of candy placed backstage?)
[00:53:40] <Betawolf> how is that 'Mixture'?
[00:54:46] <gwern> because there were brown ones
[00:55:42] <kuudes> nice
[00:56:40] <kuudes> basicly, a spot check
[00:56:54] <Betawolf> Claim: "Van Halen's standard performance contract contained a provision calling for them to be provided backstage with a bowl of M&Ms from which all the brown candies had been removed" Article: "The legendary ‚Äúno brown M&Ms‚Äù contract clause was indeed real", Result: "Mixture".
[00:58:31] <Betawolf> If the actual _claim_ was that they trashed a venue to the tune of thousands because of the M&Ms, then maybe that rating would be justified, but that wasn't the claim being evaluated, that was just flavourful background the article introduced.
[00:59:11] <gwern> kuudes: eh, I'd say that calling it a 'spot check' is missing what made it so good. this was more of an integration or end-to-end test. 'spot check' generally implies a random or haphazard selection; but van halen could've done random checks anywhere in the list. what made the brown m&m test work was that it was the *least* important spot. it is not random at all
[00:59:27] <shawwwn> SPOT CHECK
[00:59:32] <shawwwn> SEE SPOT CHECK
[00:59:35] <shawwwn> CHECK SPOT CHECK
[01:00:03] <gwern> kuudes: the fact that it is *not* random is also its greatest weakness. if you do actually random checks, then there's no danger in releasing the information
[01:04:10] <shawwwn> how can randomness be an asset? it's against god's will, because god doesn't play dice

[01:17:08] <gwern> Gurkenglas: they're afraid of breaking the magic spell, and also, 'everything is securities fraud'
[01:18:06] <gwern> (at 1 year, it's a pretty good example of 'the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent'. GME is sure as hell not worth $210 in fundamentals, but who dares bet against it when the GMEtards survived the original collapse?)
[01:18:53] <Gurkenglas> ah, if gamestop starts selling shares at a constant rate everyone will realize that hands cannot be diamond
[01:19:08] <Gurkenglas> so they should do risky strategies now since they can cover any failures by selling a finite, known amount of shares to cover failure
[01:19:22] <kuudes> is it legal for a company to short its own shares?
[01:19:38] <Gurkenglas> it needn't short, it can just write new shares on a piece of paper, right?
[01:19:53] <kuudes> yes, but it could get more value by selling the shorts

[01:21:20] <Gurkenglas> gwern yeah but presumably selling to cover their debt was fine, so just get more debt
[01:21:28] <ggreer> kuudes: the business gets fined if they flout the mask rule
[01:21:29] <adiabatic> come back to california, there are pockets of FREEDOM here
[01:21:40] <gwern> Gurkenglas: oh sure, because paying down debt is morally laudable. the *motives* are totally different
[01:21:49] <kuudes> hmm, ok
[01:21:59] <gwern> (of course, the effect is pretty much the same, but since when do normies care about mere *consequences*)
[01:22:01] <ggreer> one thing I *am* fine with is businesses deciding on their own what to do. many places in seattle are requiring proof of vaccination. that annoys me, but that's totally fine

[01:22:54] <adiabatic> the most paranoid I've had here was being directed to a pile of masks when I entered the Apple Store without one one
[01:22:55] <Gurkenglas> at this point should gamestop just close all the stores and go full on buzzword crypto

[05:22:38] <gwern> (ugh, I hate mowing. scrambles my brain. had to delete a tweet twice just now)
[05:33:13] <ggreer> I guess it's not like walking
[05:34:38] <gwern> it's like walking... on mount everest
[05:45:11] <ggreer> gwern: is it the noise? maybe some ear protection would help?
[05:45:42] <gwern> ggreer: I already use ear muffs + noise-canceling earphones. it's the motion and vibration and residual sound and stuff getting into your eyes and everything
[05:45:45] <ggreer> ah
[05:46:10] <gwern> when I mow the whole property, it takes a good 15 minutes before the ground stops 'sliding away' because of the constant motion causing an optical illusion once you stop
[05:46:58] <ggreer> oh yeah. I get that on motorcycles or bicycles sometimes
[05:47:15] <gwern> it's odd that that doesn't happen to such a degree in a car even if you drive for like 4 or 5 hours; I think the difference is that in mowing you are very intently focused closely on the ground instead of essentially looking out to optical-infinity
[05:47:44] <ggreer> that makes sense. on two wheeled vehicles I tend to be on the lookout for obstructions that could flatten a tire and ruin my day
[05:47:50] <gwern> but on mowing, it's extremely intense. like 200ug LSD levels of texture flux
[05:48:38] <ggreer> I don't remember that being an issue when I worked landscaping in the summers, but it was usually a lot of different tasks split up. mow for 15 minutes, then weedwack, then use a riding mower for some other stuff
[05:49:26] <ggreer> hmmm speaking of earpro: https://www.amazon.com/Howard-Leight-Amplification-Electronic-R-01526/dp/B01HI8CN24 I really should stop using foamies

[05:50:01] <gwern> ggreer: yeah, 15 minutes probably isn't enough. I'm doing more like 120 minutes at top speed without a single pause or break
[05:50:08] <ggreer> !
[05:50:10] <ggreer> wow
[05:50:52] <gwern> it's pretty miserable. I keep thinking about how I can get out of this. I don't know if it's the worst part of my life right now, but it's got to be in the running
[05:51:09] <gwern> which is of course why I have to do it, because no one else wants to or can easily be paid to do it
[05:51:55] <gwern> at least the meadow successfully knocked a good 30 minutes or so off the mowing time
[05:52:04] <ggreer> is it a riding mower?
[05:52:10] <gwern> yeah, a nice zero-turn
[05:52:26] <ggreer> that seems like the most efficient way to get it done
[05:52:37] <adiabatic> can you get better goggles for the stuff-getting-into-your-eyes problem
[05:52:39] <gwern> (the meadow is also good because it is the part with the most sun, although the past 2 years I've taken to starting mowing at dusk)
[05:53:10] <adiabatic> I use gun-range ear protection when I vacuum and I have zero regrets
[05:53:12] <gwern> adiabatic: probably. the problem there is I can't figure out what sort of normal goggle would work with my mask for breathing. the silicone seal bumps up the goggle

[06:34:26] <gwern> oh, interesting
[06:34:45] <rmmh> doesn't seem *totally* legit though, combinatorics and set theory are very far from probability
[06:34:58] <gwern> hm... I'm surprised to see linear algebra so far away
[06:35:14] <rmmh> it's using tag co-occurence to infer edges
[06:35:16] <gwern> I'd expect linear algebra to be like, a *subset* of probability theory, practically
[06:36:02] * gwern goes with 'transfinite ordinals' as the other example. if anyone comes up with an argument that 'oh yes, a probabilist will use transfinite ordinals *all the time*', well, they just want it more than gwern

[06:46:44] <feepbot> Virgin boy eggs are a traditional dish of Dongyang, Zhejiang, China in which eggs are boiled in the urine of young boys who were presumably peasants, preferably under the age of ten.
[06:47:26] <saturn2> koreans on karts
[06:47:37] <rmmh> I would presume young boys' urine has less garbage from drinking alcohol and eating excessive amounts of meat
[06:47:59] <rmmh> but idk how much the composition (~flavor??) changes
[06:48:38] <rmmh> virgin boy eggs sounds like an invention of someone that decided the best part of eating kidneys is the faint taste of urine, but that kidneys are too expensive
[06:51:42] <nshepperd> perhaps the Emperor declared that killing young peasant boys and eating their kidneys wasn't allowed any more, and this was the next best thing

[08:14:58] <nshepperd2> more like she became an abstract concept
[08:18:14] <gwern> true but even well before that kyuubey was just casually describing her as potentially a 'god' to give an idea of the magnitude of her power. however, he didn't particularly mean anything ontological by it, and was surprised when she did pull a stunt like that
[08:18:52] <quanticle> Yeah, I feel like Madoka turning into an abstract concept is more like Serial Experiments Lain than End of Evangelion
[08:20:11] <gwern> it's a bit Yui-esque. Yui becomes a symbol for the will to live, no matter what, as an inspiration to help everyone save themselves; Madoka becomes a symbol for saving everyone, and that somewhere, there's a boddhisattva fighting for you
[08:20:39] <gwern> anyway, you can't expect *exact* analogues. it'd be extremely disappointing of urubochi if he made madoka *exactly* equivalent to Yui or Shinji or someone in EoE
[08:20:58] <quanticle> True

[11:27:24] <nshepperd2> heh
[11:27:31] <adiabatty> there are a couple main reasons why IF works: (1) you're unlikely to eat as many calories in two meals that you do in three (2) not eating for long periods lets your insulin levels fall, and insulin makes you fat
[11:28:40] <adiabatty> one of the interesting anecdotes in Fung's book is that T1Ds deliberately under-dose themselves with insulin to lose weight, but this is moderately dangerous
[11:29:27] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[11:31:16] <nshepperd2> yeah if you dose less than appropriate for your BMR your blood goes acidic which can kill you
[11:31:46] <adiabatty> oh, I thought you 'just' had to worry about passing out and hitting your head on the floor and getting a concussion
[11:31:48] <nshepperd2> and if you eat anything and have high blood glucose levels for long periods that does a bunch of long term damage
[11:32:42] <kuudes> insulin things indeed can kill you in many ways
[11:32:44] <adiabatty> yeah, in your case I'm making a bunch of noncommital "eh, um, unh‚Ä¶" noises
[11:33:41] <nshepperd2> it's mostly overdosing insulin which causes people to pass out. and get brain damage. luckily that's never happened to me
[11:33:58] <kuudes> given that my typos are > 1/100 and my yearly mortality is < 3/1000, indeed I should be wary on when doing insulin stuff
[11:34:05] <adiabatty> what about massive glucose drops? doesn't that cause people to pass out?
[11:34:12] <kuudes> and die?
[11:34:30] <kuudes> isn't it sort of comparable to stopping breathing?

[11:34:54] <feep[work]> "This machine causes people to pass out and die"
[11:35:17] <dutchie> i was told also partly because glucose will naturally drop so even if you pass out from hyperglycaemia it'll eventually get back down to a reasonable level without intervention
[11:35:46] <dutchie> not sure how accurate that (or my recollection of it) is
[11:36:07] <adiabatty> sounds reasonable. bodies use glucose.
[11:36:12] <kuudes> is that why there was that "if diabetic has lost consciousness, feed them chocolate and call emergency"
[11:36:15] <nshepperd2> sort of true but the process is very slow
[11:36:28] <nshepperd2> kidneys start filtering out glucose if it's too high
[11:36:41] <feep[work]> new theory: dementors are not a metaphor for depression but for diabetes.
[11:36:50] <nshepperd2> lol
[11:37:00] <kuudes> nurgle
[11:37:38] <adiabatty> where do the kidneys put glucose, though? do they pack it into glycogen, or is that on the consumption side in muscles
[11:37:47] <nshepperd2> you excrete it
[11:38:00] <dutchie> kuudes: the advice is generally not to put food into unconscious people's mouths in case they choke on it, just call an ambulance and tell them the person is diabetic
[11:38:01] <adiabatty> oh. "diabetic pee smells sweet"

[13:26:41] <quanticle> saturn2: Re: London, substituting in a different city makes the claim different. As I recall, Moldbug's point with that is to show that things have gotten worse in London; that the London of the past is better than the London of today. Swapping Victorian London for modern-day Tokyo undermines that claim. Tokyo may be better or worse than London in terms of crime, but acknowledging that fact
[13:26:44] <quanticle> tells us little about the trend in London.
[13:28:10] <kuudes> surely most anything was worse in past than now

[13:43:14] <quanticle> I thought his point was that culture was getting worse over time, and that this made crime worse. To support his point he claimed that crime was less prevalent in Victorian London. Substituting Tokyo for Victorian London dose support the claim that culture has an effect on crime (arguably), but it undercuts the claim that culture in the UK has been degrading over time.
[13:43:48] <Betawolf> does it? That just seems to suggest Tokyo has a better culture.
[13:44:11] <saturn2> "So we see that an English government of the Victorian era‚Äîwithout DNA testing or closed-circuit TV‚Äîmanaged to largely abolish crime. We also see that the present-day government of England (and of other places governed in the same way) pretends to want to abolish crime‚Äîbut to be unable to do so. Are we inclined to doubt this pretence? We are. Are we entitled to doubt it? We certainly are.
[13:44:12] <saturn2> But if this pretence is indeed a pretence, if crime can indeed be abolished by enforcement, we accuse the present regime of something very serious. It becomes an accessory to this crime, which it could have abolished but chose not to."
[13:44:13] <quanticle> Right, that's what I'm saying.
[13:44:46] <Betawolf> Like, I'd parse that as the UK once had a Tokyo-level culture, and now does not, which is degradation.
[13:44:48] <quanticle> Right, but the English government of the Victorian-era *didn't* abolish crime. Not even close.
[13:45:06] <saturn2> all he's really trying to show is that some governments have abolished crime and some haven't

[13:52:45] <Robomot> Crime in Japan - Wikipedia (The rate of crime in Japan is generally low in comparison to other countries, ranking from low to moderate in most cities and towns. However, issues still remain, and many crimes manifest in several forms; especially in regards to organized crimes and massacres. In 2015, Japan had one of the lowest murder rates in the world, but higher than Singapore.[ ‚Ä¶)
[13:53:00] <kuudes> I mean, I would hold also "finnish government managed to largely abolish crime"
[13:53:03] <kuudes> as false
[13:53:11] <Betawolf> Japan is great at not murdering people, at least.
[13:53:29] <saturn2> compared to san francisco it's close enough to true
[13:53:40] <kuudes> that seems to just say sf is a bad place
[13:53:57] <saturn2> yes
[13:54:27] <kuudes> " we accuse the present regime of something very serious. It becomes an accessory to this crime, which it could have abolished but chose not to." <- this accusation seems to fail as its premise is false?
[13:55:09] <quanticle> Honestly, I wonder how much of Moldbug's attitude comes from the fact that he lives in San Francisco.
[13:55:22] <quanticle> Would he be as pessimistic if he lived in Minneapolis?
[13:55:55] <saturn2> it's pretty obvious that that's most of it, yeah
[13:56:08] <kuudes> "and also wouldn't make any sense" <- saturn2, I hold this as possibly the highest likelihood of the presented hypothesis
[13:56:25] <kuudes> track record is that most bloggers don't actually make sense
[13:56:31] <kuudes> even those who feel they make sense
[13:56:31] <quanticle> As you've pointed out, the US is a continent-sized empire; saying that the US sucks because SF has failed to abolish crime is like saying the EU sucks because Hungary is a neo-fascist dictatorship.
[13:56:58] <kuudes> I feel ssc does not make sense often as well, and he is about the best quality there is

[14:33:34] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: I can see what you mean about the dialogue.  My impression is that they were going for this artificial feeling because of the whole theme of theater, but maybe overshot the goal.  IMO, the dialogue still works and is funny when it wants to be.  I haven't actually seen _The Very Same Munchhausen_ (I caught a bit on TV once, but that doesn't count), so I can't compare them.  I'll watch it.  What do you think of the musical numbers?  It 
[14:33:34] <dbohdan> was the major reason I fell hard for this film.

[15:14:43] <dbohdan> gwern: What makes the general degradation of Google search results more plausible to me is how drastically the results have changed in Russian.  (In my perception.  I haven't compared current results to copies of old results.)  For example, health-related searches used to bring up forums, (illegal copies of) textbooks, and research articles.  Now the first page is typically wall-to-wall MFA ("made for AdSense") sites and SEO traps on official sites of 
[15:14:43] <dbohdan> clinics/online pharmacies.  Those have very characteristic copywriting, sometimes as bad as "Do you want to know about $drug?  Many people do.  The word 'drug' comes from..."  By contrast, the results for less profitable topics, like local history, are the same as before or better.  It seems Google in English has partially defeated really poor copywriting, but anti-spam NLP stuff lags in other languages.  Making MFA sites is highly advertised on the 
[15:14:43] <dbohdan> Russian Internet (but less now than a decade ago, I think) and in general seems more mainstream and less frowned up.

[16:03:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, when Moldbug starts going on an extended acid-trip fantasy about a metamorphosing armchair, it's not easy to blame a person for being like "fuck it, I'm out"
[16:04:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unless you enjoy that sort of thing
[16:04:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which I happen to
[16:04:08] <quanticle> Yeah, I guess it's an acquired taste
[16:04:11] <quanticle> Like coffee
[16:04:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah
[16:04:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> I liked Moldbug's writing pretty much instantly
[16:04:29] <quanticle> Well, some people like coffee
[16:04:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> I had no idea what he was talking about until I read a few posts, but the writing style itself was love at first sight
[16:05:06] <quanticle> I guess the difference for me is that I like *structure*
[16:05:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I like structure! I just also like aesthetics.
[16:05:41] <quanticle> I'm okay with reading long pieces as long as it's clear that the writing is structured, there's a point, and these bits of argumentation advance the point
[16:05:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> And there is plenty of structure to MM posts
[16:05:48] <quanticle> Eh....
[16:05:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gray Mirror posts, a bit less so
[16:06:00] <quanticle> UR posts aren't very well structured, IMO
[16:06:11] <quanticle> He seems to revel in like... putting off the point for as long as possible
[16:06:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "well structured" isn't quite the same claim
[16:06:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it's one I wouldn't necessarily make
[16:06:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're structured, though
[16:06:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Putting off the point, hm, yes but there's a distinct pattern to how he does that
[16:07:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course one can't be blamed for hating *that* either
[16:07:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it serves a definite function
[16:07:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Apart from just "warding off the Eye of Sauron", which, however, is important too)
[16:08:09] <quanticle> Well, that's what I figured. Unqualified Reservations' writing is like a fighter jet throwing off chaff and flares to conceal its approach until the last possible moment.
[16:09:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Again, though, that's only one aspect of it
[16:10:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah, of course if you combine that with the entertainment-value aspect, *and* if you don't actually *get* said value (because it's not your style), well...
[16:11:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that being admitted, it is nonetheless not true that it doesn't make sense
[16:11:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Generally speaking the points being made are fairly straightforward.
[16:11:25] <quanticle> Okay, fair enough. Moldbug makes sense. It's just that he takes way too long to get to the fucking point. 
[16:11:30] <quanticle> And in that I fault him
[16:11:47] <quanticle> I fault him in the same way that I fault Nathan Robinson for his fake-ass British accent
[16:12:03] <quanticle> Moldbug has a fake-ass 19th Century British accent

[16:12:56] <quanticle> The root of this discussion is my ongoing and well-known dissatisfaction with Curtis Yarvin's writing style
[16:13:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you go on a cruise along the Norwegian coast
[16:13:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Stopping at every fjord along the way
[16:13:09] <quanticle> Hours? It's been going on for *days*.
[16:13:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then you're like
[16:13:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Goddamnit, are we *still* not in Oslo"
[16:13:25] <nshepperd2> this discussion has been years in the making
[16:13:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This flight should take like 10 hours max"
[16:13:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then (a) you're right that it's a very inefficient way of getting to Oslo, but (b) you're clearly missing the point
[16:14:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> And this is true even if eventually getting to Oslo is indeed an important goal of yours
[16:15:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Don't you *want* to get to Oslo??" "Well, yes." "Then what are we doing sipping vodka in this restaurant made entirely of ice, hundreds of kilometers away from Oslo"
[16:16:04] <kuudes> I feel uncertain if he is planning to get to oslo. might be that some random people take his ferry and then end up to reykjavik and some of them are "this is where I wanted all along" and some complain
[16:16:06] <quanticle> No, no. Because in that context, you know that you're going on a trip to see some fjords. Moldbug starts out by describing the existence some wonderful insight (but not the insight itself!), and then leading you off in circles. It's as if someone said, "Hey, I know of a *wonderful city* to the North!" And you said, "Sounds great, let's go visit!" And then they took you on a fjord-visiting trip.
[16:16:09] <quanticle> Yes, eventually you get to Oslo, and sure, Oslo is fine and good, but did you really have to stop at *every* fjord along the way?
[16:16:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're very nice fjords
[16:17:20] <quanticle> And now I want to visit Oslo
[16:17:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Example chosen because of actual cruise my friends took a couple years ago that did indeed sound like a lot of fun)
[16:17:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The ice restaurant is also a real thing)
[16:18:04] <quanticle> Oh yeah, there's also an ice hotel
[16:18:30] <quanticle> You know, in case you want to upgrade your ice experience from a couple hours to overnight
[16:19:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> "[Tucker] Carlson has said "I love Curtis Yarvin"" ... maybe you're just not conservative enough to appreciate Moldbug, quanticle

[18:57:32] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: no, hyphenopoly only does half of the tex thing, you might say: it does hyphenation (knuth-liang), but browsers continue to poorly exploit the available hyphenation by doing a line at a time instead of laying out an entire block to minimize whitespace & hyphen use (knuth-plass). hyphenopoly was useful when we needed to work around Chrome's "oh I just don't do english...
[18:57:38] <gwern> ...hyphenation on desktop lol" but now that it *does*, hyphenopoly is useless to us. what we need is something which does the knuth-plass entire-paragraph-or-list-item-at-a-time layout, which being smarter, will greatly reduce the big whitespace gaps from s t r e t c h i n g o u t s h o r t l i n e s or breaking words like 'super-\n      califragilisticexpialidocious\n'. bonus points if it...
[18:57:44] <gwern> ...goes beyond just the linebreaks to doing the other possible micro-typography things like fiddling slightly with word/character spacings & sizes
[19:02:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> And how do you propose to do all of this
[19:02:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or is this just like "if I were a fancy-layout-system-having man"
[19:03:51] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: well, there are old JS libs to demonstrate 'this is how we totally could do knuth-plass in html'. they *probably* still work. afaict no one goes beyond that to the other microtype except the perennially lol 'asymmetrica'
[19:03:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also, Hyphenopoly's hyphenation is superior to Chrome's default, but, sure, not *that* superior, and of course you're right about the lack of the other stuff)
[19:04:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Aren't those the things that convert your HTML into some horrifying shit like wrapping every word in a <span> or some such nonsense
[19:04:48] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah, I could believe hyphenopoly still does it better, but without the better layout algorithm which will *use* it, I can't imagine it makes much of a difference. whatever the better hyphenation giveth, the greedy linebreaking taketh
[19:05:50] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: dunno. I haven't looked at the details. asymmetrica probably spews spans, yeah. I'd hope the JS knuth-plasses do something more sensible like inserting soft linebreaks or something
[19:06:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Soft linebreaks? Ain't no such thing
[19:08:48] <gwern> ZERO-WIDTH SPACE? it'd place it where the greedy linebreaker will then take it

[19:24:12] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: the long paragraphs is a bit of a red herring or excuse imo. it's totally easy to fix that: K-P can be optin as a css property (in fact, I think there's already one, the browsers just ignore it?), and it'd be trivial (and is a very common move in dealing with worst-cases) to just put in a length limit of some sort ('after 5kb of text, stop further processing'; given the...
[19:24:18] <gwern> ...inherent locality of this, despite its pseudo-globalness, it's highly unlikely that any real examples are going to have noticeable layout shifts or decreases in layout quality if the window is truncated)
[19:26:12] <gwern> the float issue, yeah, I dunno enough about floating to say what an obvious solution there is. I'd guess you can probably do something like fixing the float and then computing k-p under that constraint (or doing 1 pass to roughly estimate the optimal float position, fixing it, and then a second cleanup pass), and if it isn't quite tex quality, well, that's just life on the web, use a PDF if...

[19:57:27] <gwern> (and yes, inserting lots of spaces is nasty, but it's no worse than, say, inserting soft hyphens everywhere, is it?)
[19:57:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's definitely better than wrapping every word in a span, that's for sure
[19:58:40] <gwern> (using the unicode spaces to control linebreaking, literally what they are designed for, makes a lot more sense to me than wrapping everything in a bazillion spans... maybe bramstein did that for better control of the word-spacing and other properties)

[20:00:46] <gwern> ...common? they are *rectangular*!
[20:04:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So, it sort of works: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/e3dqqpc59jtrzhp/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-25%20at%2011.33.23%20AM.png?dl=0 ... (nbsp in place of spaces, and regular spaces where the linebreaks ought to be)
[20:04:11] <Robomot> image/png (1306x376; 101 KB)
[20:04:43] <gwern> that looks pretty reasonable
[20:05:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: But: firstly, the last line has the minimal word spacing and therefore looks like shit. And secondly, if you turn on hyphenation... https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1h518qui8gc8hlk/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-25%20at%2011.34.39%20AM.png?dl=0
[20:05:02] <Robomot> image/png (1335x399; 107 KB)
[20:06:21] <gwern> wow, what happens there? aren't you forcing the linebreaks in specific places? is the greedy linebreaking causing hyphenation to happen anyway where it shouldn't?
[20:06:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed
[20:06:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> So you'd want to wrap just the last line in a span that fixes the word spacing ... and ensure that the result of that is not then another line; and you would want to turn off auto-hyphenation and add soft hyphens where they need to be
[20:08:01] <gwern> mm. so you'd need to go back to hyphenopoly... the inserting control spaces and then handling the last line isn't too bad
[20:08:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not infeasible, I think, and it seems a distinctly better solution than the <span> thing, though of course you'd still need to wrap every word in a span to begin with in order to retrieve word positions
[20:08:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fundamentally that's the problem - JS has no access to the layout system's handling of text node contents
[20:09:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's no way to get any info on where any given word or sentence is, there's no concept of a "line" or even "paragraph" that you can query
[20:10:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> This would be an improvement on the latexTypeset approach but not ... enough of one for *us* to spend effort on it
[20:10:36] <gwern> (all painful enough that one wonders if maybe it'd be more feasible to do something like a linter: run a headless browser on the final compiled html, run the tex-style 'badness' quality heuristic over the document as rendered by specific target browsers like 'iphone x', and flag particularly bad parts for manual editing)
[20:10:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, maybe
[20:11:25] <gwern> (you could of course read your own docs in dev tools but by the nature of this thing, such proofreading is never final - any wording or design change anywhere could create new badness)
[20:11:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> But what width would you do it at? The badness value may change if you resize the viewport by so much as a pixel, and of course FF vs. Chrome, cross-platform issues
[20:12:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> You'd want your linter to take multiple samples, at each of a range of viewport widths (every 2px or every 5px across some suitable range, say) - this would probably approximate platform/browser differences sufficiently
[20:13:20] <feep> two2thehead: I currently walk home, that's ~ an hour a day
[20:13:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then you'd, maybe, take the maximum badness value across the samples, or something, and flag on that basis
[20:14:03] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: wouldn't a dev tools setting like 'iphone x' have a fixed pixel count? it's not like apple manufactures them with screen tolerances of +-15 pixels or something
[20:14:14] <gwern> ...do they?
[20:15:03] <gwern> but yeah, such a tool would probably go with worst-case over the n most common mobile settings
[20:15:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Certainly, but what I am saying is, if you just sample at "iPhone X width" and get a badness value of <something acceptable>, what you won't capture is that over there is a guy on a Galaxy phone or some shit and his badness value is <horrible>
[20:15:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Even if it happens to be the same pixel width!)
[20:15:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> So you simulate the variation across platforms by sampling across a range of pixel widths
[20:16:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> The effect is the same, after all
[20:16:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anything that causes a shift in what words get put on what lines is the same, no matter if it's caused by a wider viewport or thinner glyph rendering, etc.
[20:16:35] <gwern> you can't report at *every* pixel width, that'd just generate vastly too many worst-case badnesses, I'd predict, which hand-editing can't fix.
[20:17:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, of course, not every; I don't know what is the best way to aggregate the samples
[20:17:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Average, maybe? Dunno
[20:18:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe like, a set of k common screen widths, with each k being "fuzzed" by actually being a range of n pixel widths
[20:18:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Average over n, take maximum badness over k, report if exceeds your threshold badness
[20:19:02] <gwern> sounds reasonableish
[20:19:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pick your n (interval and density of samples) according to how much compute you want to spend
[20:19:28] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[20:21:21] <gwern> you could probably hack his code to do this. just delete everything after the badness calculation, and put the badness calculation in the jittering loop
