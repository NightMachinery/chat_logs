There was a 3x3 array of blackboards in the classroom, and he would methodically fill them up (in column order) as he went. It took SUPERhuman effort to keep with him while taking notes.   He had ten or so written pages in front of him on his table but he never looked at them.

[03:00:18] <mornfall> johnkeats6: it also makes sense intuitively, state of A is constrained by the state of B, pretty much the definition of entanglement (in this case, the constraint would be A ≠ B)
[03:02:12] <johnkeats6> ok but then if you model a qubit as the spin of a spin 1/2 fermion for instance the state space for n qubits isn't really 2^n dimensional
[03:02:25] <mornfall> or in the fairytale version, if you learn that A is in some state, you also learn that B is definitely _not_ in that state :-)

[03:04:16] <mornfall> why not? if you only consider spin, they are independent as long as you make sure there's some other part of the state of the fermion that's distinct (and which you don't make part of your qubit)
[03:06:48] <mornfall> [spin₁, otherstuff₁] ≠ [spin₂, otherstuff₂] as long as otherstuff₁ ≠ otherstuff₂, even if spin₁ = spin₂… (unless it's me having a brain fart, anyway)

[03:42:13] <johnkeats6> you have functions R^4 x R^4 --> C^4 (x) C^4, the symmetric S_2 should act switching the R^4's and also the C^4's i guess
[03:42:43] *** Joins: Trigo (~NeedMathH@64.201.115.44)
[03:51:19] <johnkeats6> that makes more sense bc then even if they have the same momentum i can get a nonzero wavefunction by giving them opposite spins
[03:52:16] <johnkeats6> but then i'm just not sure how to interpret "projecting out the spacetime part" to only think of spins
[03:53:06] <mornfall> well you just sum up all the states with a given spin
[03:53:31] <mornfall> it's not going to work out if you don't constrain the momenta to be different though, by _some_ means (the ‘magic’ bit in my doodle)
[03:53:58] *** Quits: xeno (~xeno@user/xeno) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:56:42] <johnkeats6> i guess if there's some other property than spin (like momentum) that distinguishes all the electrons i could arbitrarily pick an ordering for that property and read just that term in the anti-symmetrization
[03:57:33] <johnkeats6> but i'm not very satisfied with that as a definition
[03:58:48] <johnkeats6> how do you go from u^+(p) (x) u^+(p') e^{-i p.x - i p'.y} - u^+(p') (x) u^+(p) e^{-i p.y - i p'.x} to |up> |up>?
[03:59:05] <mornfall> i think it's much easier to deal with a second discrete property; saves you the trouble of integrating over the momentum-space
[04:00:08] *** Quits: biberao (~m@user/biberao) (Quit: WeeChat 2.3)
[04:03:05] <mornfall> but there's nothing specifically quantum about it; you have a thing that can be in one of 4 states: ↑a ↑b ↓a ↓b… it's ↑ if it's either ↑a or ↑b and it's ↓ if it's either ↓a or ↓b
[04:03:28] <mornfall> if it's probabilistic, you just say that p(↑) is p(↑a) + p(↑b)
[04:03:38] <johnkeats6> ok, we take C^2 parametrizing spin and tensor in another C^2 parametrizing some random thing, let's call it black/white. so i could have a state |up>|white> and an |up>|black>. then tensor product and anti-symmetrize to |up>|white>|up>|black> - |up>|black>|up>|white>
[04:04:14] <johnkeats6> how do you project that to an |up>|up>
[04:04:59] <johnkeats6> i guess you specifically apply <white|<black|
[04:06:41] <johnkeats6> i suppose that makes some sense
[04:10:26] <johnkeats6> in the previous case i'd multiply by e^(i p.x + i p'.y} and integrate d^4 x d^4 y, something like that
[04:12:23] <johnkeats6> why can't math and physics just be easy

[06:08:17] <somiaj> well let R1 subset R2
[06:08:21] <Al-Khwarizmi> maybe I'm over complecating this

[06:42:14] <cherim> A staircase set S in d=3 is fully determined by a function f(x, y) = max {z: (x, y, z) in S}.
[06:42:18] <cherim> Indeed, (x, y, z) belongs to the set iff z<=f(x, y).
[06:42:21] <cherim> Also, the functions arising in this way satisfy f(x, y)>=f(x', y) when x<=x', and f(x, y)>=f(x, y') when y<=y', but otherwise are arbitrary.
[06:42:25] <cherim> These inequalities are directly "u in S, v<u and differs in one coordinate => v in S".
[06:42:29] <cherim> A plane partition is itself defined as a function f (sometimes denoted pi) with these properties. S <-> f is the bijection.
[06:42:44] <cherim> But this formalism only shadows the picture in a sense
[06:43:22] <cherim> In the picture https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_partition , there is a cube at (x, y, z) iff (x, y, z) is in S.

[07:09:33] <harwiltz> Hello all. I'm trying to find an example of a normed vector space X, a Banach space Y, and a continuous linear and surjective map F:X->Y that isn't open. I think the only way to go about this intuitively is by considering two topologies on the same set where one is coarser than the other (and then A is the identity map). So I'm thinking we can let X = L^3 and Y = L^3 but equipped with the L2 norm.
[07:09:35] <harwiltz> This way X,Y are both normed vector spaces, Y is Banach, and X isn't. I'm just having trouble determining if X has a finer topology than Y.

[07:19:24] <Guest78> or 3 parts...etc

[08:58:52] <somiaj> The multiplication group mod p can be thought of as {1,2,3,...,p-1} has order of p-1. One thing that follows from this is n^{p-1} = 1 mod(p) for any element in the group, which is n != 0 mod p

[09:19:13] <XCode> I have a question. Suppose We have an abelian surface X. Assume we have a curve D subset of X (i.e., dim(D) = 1) , such that there exists rational function f defined on D such that div_D(f) = p_1 -  p_2. Can we always construct a curve H of measure 0, and rational function h such that div_H(h) = p_1 - p_2 ?
[09:19:19] <int-e> yes (except there's no such n; to get 4 from 1 you need to multiply by 4 and that gives 4*3*2*1)

[12:23:58] <fweht> is this about right?

[16:45:29] <Franciman> the thing here is that natural numbers are a set of measure 0
[16:45:34] <Franciman> so they don't matter when integrating
[16:45:37] <Franciman> but
[16:45:40] <harwiltz> If it's easier though, I think it's equally good for me to consider only monotonically decreasing, nonnegative continuous functions. But then I'd have to show that the subset of l^2 of monotonically decreasing nonnegative sequences is complete.
[16:45:54] <Franciman> when there is continuity
[16:46:05] <Franciman> you know that in a neighborhood of i \in N
[16:46:11] <Franciman> you have a similar behaviour
[16:46:16] <harwiltz> Right
[16:46:23] <Franciman> now for each i
[16:46:35] <Franciman> you take a small neighborhood D_i = ]i - eps, i + eps[
[16:46:42] <Franciman> such that i is the only natural number in it
[16:46:45] <Franciman> ok?
[16:46:49] <harwiltz> Yup
[16:46:54] <Franciman> and you do such that
[16:47:12] <Franciman> |f(x) - f(i)| < q in D_i
[16:47:17] <Franciman> you can do this because of continuity
[16:47:26] <harwiltz> What's q supposed to represent?
[16:47:30] <aquery> isekaijin: interesting example. I have not tested it with affine linearly dependent sets
[16:47:44] <Franciman> q > 0
[16:47:48] <harwiltz> Ok fair
[16:47:49] <Franciman> it's the definition of continuity
[16:47:52] <Franciman> sorry
[16:47:53] <Franciman> let's do
[16:47:59] <Franciman> |f(x) - f(i)| < eps
[16:48:03] <harwiltz> Sure
[16:48:05] <Franciman> for x \in D_i =

[16:48:15] <harwiltz> Yup
[16:48:17] <Z-module> you can easily make narrow-enough triangles resting on the x-axis, centered over eacn natural n, all with height 1, so that the integral is finite.

[16:49:07] <Franciman> now harwiltz int_{D_i} |f(x)| dx
[16:49:08] <harwiltz> Z-module: yes but I want to show that the sum of f on the natural numbers is finite
[16:49:17] <Franciman> let's consider this
[16:49:26] <harwiltz> Yup, less than delta * epsilon I suppose
[16:49:34] <Franciman> in D_i, you get f(x) > f(i) - eps
[16:49:40] <Franciman> so
[16:50:01] <Z-module> harwiltz:  it can fail to be, is the point.
[16:50:03] <Franciman> assume f is already positive, so we get rid of the abs value
[16:50:17] <harwiltz> Z-module: Ah... yes that makes sense
[16:50:28] <harwiltz> Franciman: I think Z-module already busted it

[17:44:54] <harwiltz> So let X just be a normed vector space, and Y = R. Then we can use Hahn-Banach to find a continuous linear functional F:X -> Y for which F = 0 on a linear subspace M of X and F > 0 for some convex set U disjoint from M. So F is surjective by linearity. Also F(M) = {0} so F is not open. Does that work?

[20:58:43] <isekaijin> Nope, no idea, sadly.
[20:58:56] <Guest78> I don't know either, but it works
[20:58:59] <Guest78> and its like magic to me
[20:59:17] <Guest78> what's a sheaf?
[20:59:43] <isekaijin> Mmm, I will try to motivate it.
[20:59:54] <Guest78> okay. I know what varieties and ideals are
[20:59:58] <Guest78> please be gentle
[21:00:29] <isekaijin> If you have a function f : X -> Y, you can think of its graph as a subset S of X x Y with an obvious bijective correspondence X <-> S.
[21:01:18] <isekaijin> Now, sometimes we want to consider “functions”, except that S is not quite a subset of a Cartesian product in any obvious way.
[21:01:44] <isekaijin> For example, suppose you want to think of a vector field as a “function” that assigns to each point a tangent vector.
[21:02:34] <isekaijin> The problem is that the tangent spaces at each different point are, strictly speaking, not the same vector space. (They are isomorphic, though, but this is not required for a general sheaf.)
[21:03:03] <johnkeats6> i "learned" sheaf cohomology from that claire voisin book. never really got the point of it too much, but it's just more general than e.g. singular cohomology
[21:03:17] <johnkeats6> i think obstruction theory is a good classical motivation for this sorta stuff
[21:04:19] <johnkeats6> you have a bundle E --> B and you wanna construct sections. you start with a section on the 0-skeleton, and build up inductively. each time you have some obstruction that's basically measured by pi_k of the fiber
[21:04:36] <isekaijin> So, as a first intuitive approximation, a sheaf is a thing you can define “functions” on, but is not quite the Cartesian product.
[21:04:39] <Guest78> mm
[21:04:46] <johnkeats6> obstruction theory is the idea that all these combine to a cohomology problem, but it's valued in a thing that varies as you move from point to point
[21:04:54] <johnkeats6> so it's not taking coefs in a fixed thing
[21:04:55] *** Quits: dauggy (~wojtek@31.12.0.178) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:05:09] <isekaijin> The “functions” are called “sections”, because you can think of X x Y as a “cake”, and then S is a “transversal slice” of the cake.
[21:05:16] <isekaijin> And sheafs generalize this idea.
[21:05:23] <isekaijin> sheaves*, ffs
[21:06:06] <isekaijin> And if you want the formalism, you can get it from Wikipedia or the nLab, of course, but I tried to convey the intuitive idea.
[21:06:35] <tusko> i like cake
[21:06:44] <isekaijin> I like cake too.
[21:07:07] <isekaijin> johnkeats6: I see.

[21:08:11] <isekaijin> I don't find anything about number theory easy to understand.
[21:08:17] <isekaijin> But what would be the examples there?
[21:08:20] <Galois> consider a polynomial f(x). This is a legit function. We learn this in high school. It maps a |-> f(a)
[21:08:43] <isekaijin> Okay, then?
[21:08:55] <Galois> ok, but we can also think of the function the other way. Fix some constant a. Then we have a "function" f |-> f(a) where the domain is the set of polynomials
[21:09:04] <Galois> again, this is a legit function
[21:09:16] <Galois> a perfectly normal function, no sheafs required
[21:09:21] <isekaijin> Sure.
[21:09:38] <Galois> now observe that f(a) is canonically equal to f(x) mod (x-a)
[21:09:46] <isekaijin> Again, sure.
[21:09:53] <isekaijin> (But so far no sheaves required.)
[21:10:13] <Galois> ok, so for a fixed f, we now have a function from "primes" (x-a) to "constants": (x-a) |-> f(x) mod (x-a)
[21:10:21] <Galois> oops, I messed up
[21:10:24] <Galois> for a fixed _prime_ (x-a)
[21:10:26] <Galois> and f is the variable
[21:10:34] <Galois> we have a function f |-> f(x) mod (x-a)
[21:11:03] <Galois> of course, this concept works with other primes. For example x^2+1 is prime in R[x], but x^2+1 isn't of the form (x-a)
[21:11:19] <Galois> we can get a function f |-> f(x) mod (x^2+1). Again, a bona fide function
[21:12:06] <Guest78> GAlois, apologies, but could you explain your statement about f(a) being equivalent to f(x) mod (x-a)? What does f(x) mod (x-a) mean?
[21:12:17] <Guest78> oh remainder of a polynomial
[21:12:33] <Galois> you just need to know that dividing by (x-a) leaves a remainder which is equal to f(a)
[21:12:48] <Guest78> didn't know that, cool, thanks
[21:13:12] <Galois> ok so I have a point here, even though it's meandering. If we fix the function f and consider the function whose inputs are primes p, and whose operation is p |-> f(x) mod p, we don't quite get a function anymore

Assume we have a curve D subset of X (i.e., dim(D) = 1) , such that there exists rational function f defined on D such that div_D(f) = p_1 -  p_2. Can we always construct a curve H of measure 0, and rational function h such that div_H(h) = p_1 - p_2 ?
[21:15:46] <Galois> surfaces are too hard :(
[21:16:13] <Galois> to do number theory, you need to take the number field analogue. So you have a prime p, and an integer n. You consider the operation n mod p.
[21:16:34] <Galois> for a fixed p, (n |-> n mod p) is a legit function, taking values in Z/pZ
[21:16:59] <Galois> for a fixed n, (p |-> n mod p) needs the sheaves machinery. The values are in Z/pZ but p varies as the input changes.
[21:17:10] <isekaijin> Yeah, okay, now that example works.
[21:17:29] <Galois> the sheav [sic] that you get is Spec(Z) naturally
