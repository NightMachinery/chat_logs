[16:30:06] <VectorX> it does that already
[16:30:30] <VectorX> since it has to match (Consumo (?:F/)?Ponta) somewhere on the line before it gets the groups
[16:30:49] <VectorX> you can put text the the Text Area and see what it matches
[16:31:08] <re101-kakapo-68> Yes! I've tested it! Thanks a lot!
[16:31:25] <VectorX> I was not sure about the decimal part though in case you have something like 2.2,2313123  or 42.2,232.32  etc
[16:31:56] <re101-kakapo-68> no

[18:15:21] <fdan> ok
[18:15:23] <digitok> (number.){3}number
[18:15:26] <digitok> basically
[18:16:34] <digitok> it can be simplified slightly, but it would allow leading 0s
[18:16:45] <digitok> for 00-09
[18:17:45] <fdan> oh ok

[18:19:35] <digitok> in pcre (or python's "regex" module), it could be shortened and to ^(?:(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|1?\d?\d)\.){3}(?1)$
[18:20:17] <digitok> where (?1) takes the regex from inside the (25...\d) group so that it doesn't need to be repeated
