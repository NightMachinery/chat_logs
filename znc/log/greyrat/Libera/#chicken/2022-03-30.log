[13:03:58] <C-Keen> The old cairo egg uses output from pkg-config for cflags and lib flags, is there some chicken 5 egg I could steal the same mechanic from?
[13:05:27] <sjamaan> The postgres egg uses pkg-config too
[13:05:46] <C-Keen> sjamaan: ah I will have a look at that thx
[13:07:46] <C-Keen> sjamaan: ah you are doing the build in a separate shell script!
[13:08:14] <sjamaan> yup
[13:10:22] <C-Keen> hm...
[13:22:31] <s-liao> is the pkg-config the standard file of the meta information the installed libs in some of Distro Linux?
[13:24:17] <sjamaan> I think it's a Free Desktop standard
[13:24:40] <sjamaan> yeah, https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/

[14:26:06] <C-Keen> heh
[14:26:16] <C-Keen> which is called?
[14:26:50] <C-Keen> I just used chicken-install sdl2 and that's what I got

[23:53:52] <Bunny351> computer security is an illusion, anyway.
[23:54:56] <Bunny351> don't pretend it is humanly possible to keep it under control.
