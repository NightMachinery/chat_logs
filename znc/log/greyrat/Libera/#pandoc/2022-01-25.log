[22:02:27] <ede> hi, i was trying to add some links (actually 2 groups, dirs and files) to the end of the page in a useful way, but both linking and having an easy table isn't a nice thing.
[22:03:38] <ede> i like to confuse markdown and certain wiki syntaxes, also pandoc has a ton of extension i just can't remember, but i'd prefer to stay with just markdown if i don't make a file for a particular wiki...
[22:06:20] <ede> the links are more a technical question, it's really annoying to have to write every filename twice (link and linktext), isn't there a *useable* short notation for local files? something like mediawiki has for relative links, in the most simple case for a file in the same directory.
[22:28:51] <ede> wait... my download of https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/archive/refs/tags/2.14.2.tar.gz has 6231550 bytes, the .deb is 15M. was confused that on github both types have about the same size, but now i see 15M also for that exact tgz. odd.
[22:29:51] <ede> ah seems it's the source
[23:14:50] <jaawerth> ede: that depends on markdown flavor - if you use `-f gfm` to specify github-flavored-markdown, it should make any raw/valid links clickable
[23:15:42] <ede> jaawerth: ah, didn't think of gfm. i think because of the missing tables (which i seem to need no matter what i do)
[23:16:21] <ede> usually i start ending extensions and then i end up with insanely long command lines.
[23:16:28] <ede> adding
[23:18:01] <ede> and i'm sure there's at least 3 different wikis interfering half of the time.
[23:24:07] <__monty__> GFM has tables though?
[23:30:17] <ede> does it? seems i missed it then. i think i can remember a discussion few years ago if to implement them or not.
[23:30:31] <ede> not 100% sure but i thinke i used mmd most of the time
[23:46:01] <jaawerth> it definitely does
[23:46:38] <jaawerth> it ain't pretty without css, personally I Just grab a standalone CSS as a general fallback for converting standalone md like https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura and stick it in my data dir along with a yaml file for the md defaults I want so I can gt to it with `-d`
[23:47:01] <jaawerth> that or just wrap it in a md-pandoc script (that's what I did before I found out it
[23:47:19] <jaawerth> would search the data dir, though sometimes a standalone script is still preferable)
[23:50:05] <jaawerth> ah, so I have what is probably a weird question to which the answer is going to be "use it as a haskell library", but - anyone know if there are any alternate entry hooks for the lua filter apis? like, does it use something like package.searchers or package.loaders from the lua env I can add a loader to?
[23:50:53] <jaawerth> I've been writing some filters for fennel-lang.org (and eventually for cleaning up some of ours docs to turn into man files), and `--lua-filter=<(fennel --compile filter.fnl)` does work for on-the-fly AOT compilation to lua (plus, makefiles) but it'd be neat if it can be done live/in-memory without much hassle
