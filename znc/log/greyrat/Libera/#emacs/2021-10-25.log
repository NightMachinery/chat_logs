[00:07:00] <dharju> hi! when using org-refile with org-refile-use-outline-path set, i still don't get the full path to an entry. instead, i only get the top-level heading, like "Heading/ (todo.org)" for all sub-headings to "Heading". this instead makes it impossible to tell sub-headings apart from each other (and from the top-level heading). i'm using ivy+counsel, but i get the same behavior with vertico. has anyone
[00:07:02] <dharju> else had this issue and know what's causing it?

[03:51:16] <perrierjouet> are you in help section

[03:58:23] <kn07_> it's a matter of prefference
[03:59:17] <bobdobbs> Has anyone here publicly posted their emacs/ruby setup? I'm trying to figure out a system for sending either lines, regions or buffers to a ruby interpreter and getting back the results
[03:59:31] <bpalmer> afidegnum: perhaps you want plist-get
[03:59:40] <bobdobbs> inf-ruby can do this apparently, but I can't figure it out

[04:01:53] <Wafficus> I would recommend going on their Discord and just make a throwaway account and ask there
[04:02:20] <bobdobbs> bpalmer: yes, I've been playing with this. But I can't get it to work. The 'ruby-send*' commands don't return anything when I rrun them

[04:02:49] <Wafficus> I've seen better Emacs setups no offense perrierjouet
[04:02:50] <bobdobbs> bpalmer: well, that's not totally true. If a background ruby process isn't running, then I get notified. But if it is running, I don't get a return
[04:02:53] <Wafficus> looks like a glorified web app
[04:03:00] <perrierjouet> kn07_: did you do rm -rf .emacs.d ?
[04:03:04] <Wafficus> why not have some soul, and add some transparency, or some old school theming
[04:03:24] <kn07_> yes
[04:03:25] <edrx> bobdobbs: it's trivial to set up and very easy to hack/modify. my talk in the upcoming emacsconf will be about that.
[04:03:26] <Wafficus> kn07_ gotcha, yeah you're better off on Discord

[04:04:22] <Wafficus> I kind of wish this had a Spaceline too, that's so weird without a bottom section perrierjouet
[04:04:25] <edrx> ok! step 1: instal the package eev with M-x list-packages
[04:04:27] <perrierjouet> kn07_: what about emacs --debug-init ?
[04:04:46] <perrierjouet> kn07_: what the error message ?
[04:04:47] <Wafficus> edrx no way, use 'use-package' like a sane person in the modern day
[04:04:57] <bobdobbs> edrx: I'll have to find it and install manually. I've only been able to get Melpa to work for me once.
[04:05:02] <Wafficus> 100x easier than installing randomly via MELPA

[04:12:41] <Wafficus31> I would always roll with your own config since depending on literally one guy for his config is never going to teach you what you want out of Emacs
[04:12:56] <Wafficus31> my config is always going to be different from someone else's, and that's the best part about it
[04:13:40] <edrx> bobdobbs: ok! everything on eev is based on the idea that you can put sexps everywhere - including in comments - and you can execute them with M-e, that is almost equivalent to C-e C-x C-e. The sections 2 and 3 of the main tutorial explain everything that you need to know about that now. Read those sections and try the exercises and then we can go straight to the part that lets you send lines to repls.

[04:14:00] <bobdobbs> edrx: sorry, I must have installed it wrong. My init.el loads eev with ('require eev). But after reloading my init, 'M-x eev-*' commands aren't available. Should I be loading another file from that library?

[04:26:34] <edrx> bobdobbs: ok! the two main keys of eev are M-e, that goes to the end of the line and executes the sexp before point, and M-j, that jumps to some predefined places... M-j without a numeric argumen opens a temporary buffer whose top half is a kind of a mini-help page with some sexps that can be executed with M-e
[04:27:20] <afidegnum> bpalmer: (nth 1 entries) returns a single row 
[04:27:32] <edrx> One of the lines in that mini-help page says this:

[04:45:27] <bobdobbs> I'm hooked on it. I can't even imagine switching to another client

[04:46:59] <aidalgol> I prefer Circe over either of the built-in clients.
[04:47:21] <Catie> Okay, also Emacs

[04:47:41] <bobdobbs> Catie: erc is the only one I've tried. It has pretty much everything I need. But I don't need much.
[04:48:12] <edrx> Catie: I use rcirc. I prefer it over erc and circe because I was able to understand the innards of rcirc quickly and I can't say the same about erc or circe.

[16:35:40] <bpalmer> Political campaigns (in the US, at least) *love* sending out mail asking for money and they share their mailing lists with their likeminded compatriots very freely. *And* political stuff is usually exempted in anti-spam rules/laws

[22:58:12] <johnjay> so if i get this right, brew install emacs on mac will not install a gui build?
[22:58:26] <johnjay> but d12frosted's build is a gui build?
[22:58:43] <grym> d12frosted is a gui build; i don't know what the base option is if you don't tap it 
[22:58:49] <grym> if you don't tap d12frosted
[22:59:01] <johnjay> i just type brew install emacs and got it in terminal

[22:59:35] <johnjay> then it said to type brew unlink emacs to brew link emacs-plus@27 to override the symlinks which it did
[22:59:37] <fALSO> https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS#h5o-14 johnjay maybe --with-cocoa ?
[22:59:43] <fALSO> dont know if this documentation is up to date

[23:00:16] <johnjay> yeah but i'm not building just installing a binary like a peasant
[23:00:22] <fALSO> ahhh =)
[23:00:34] <fALSO> i didnt even knew that brew also had bins, my bad :)
[23:00:41] <grym> it primarily has binaries 
[23:00:49] <grym> occasionally it builds things
[23:00:50] <fALSO> never played with a recent mac
[23:00:55] <johnjay> like in the meme. https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-should-improve-society-somewhat
[23:00:57] <grym> johnjay: i `brew install emacs-plus@28 --with-native-comp`  and that seemed to do the thing i wanted
[23:01:11] <johnjay> i think brew downloads and compiles for you
[23:01:19] <johnjay> grym: it just passes the options to configure?
[23:01:35] <Bayes> rudybot: hmmm unit tests, you're making me sad :/
[23:01:37] <rudybot> Bayes: well written unit tests? hmmm, nicferrier is pretty serious about testing, but I don't know.
[23:01:39] <grym> johnjay: it's documented on the github page i linked you this morning
[23:01:53] <grym> johnjay: i think there's some mangling that goes on 
[23:01:55] <johnjay> ok
[23:02:41] <johnjay> this trackpad is growing on me. you can go forward or back in a browser by swiping left and right with 2 fingers
[23:02:56] <johnjay> it's almost as neat as having a mouse with multiple buttons
[23:03:14] <grym> mac's trackpads are good
[23:03:23] <grym> i un-invert the scrolling immediately though 
[23:04:00] <rpav> really? i use touch-style scrolling on everything except like mousewheel these days
[23:04:11] <johnjay> hrm. i guess i didn't notice it was inverted but i will change it regardless
[23:04:32] <artefact> invert it? so that two fingers down scrolls down?
[23:04:51] <grym> artefact: yes
[23:05:10] <artefact> i prefer it too. i changed it in libinput too
[23:05:13] <grym> the default was changed a while ago and it's confused my hands for years 
[23:05:40] <grym> on a tablet, the behavior makes sense.  when the screen and my hands are not coplanar, it doesn't 
[23:05:44] <johnjay> hilariously it defines that as "natural"
[23:05:46] <tristero> aka Australian scrolling
[23:05:46] <artefact> i could see why it's confusing for touch-screen mostly users
[23:05:48] <johnjay> how is it natural if you changing it
[23:06:16] <artefact> yeah the libinput defaults are questionable... like not enabling tap to click by default
