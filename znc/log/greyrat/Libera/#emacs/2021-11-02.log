[00:00:17] <artefact> i hate c's static typing. from what i've seen rust also goes heavily in that direction
[00:00:22] <Catie> I wouldn't mind seeing undefined behavior thrown out and replaced wholesale with implementation-defined behavior
[00:00:41] <artefact> all behaviour is implemantion-defined ;)
[00:00:56] <masterbuilder> no
[00:01:13] *** Joins: jespada (~jespada@190.7.36.46)
[00:01:29] <Catie> I mean yeah, but when it's implementation-defined the implementation has to specify it very concretely instead of doing whatever

[00:02:10] <masterbuilder> it's not the same at all, not even remotely, it would be impossible for an implementation to define every possible behavior, and hugely impractical
[00:02:20] <artefact> you're missing my point, i think
[00:02:45] <artefact> just because it's defined doesn't mean it's written somewhere in a standard. "this sequence of instructions makes the cpu crash" "well, yes, the cpu was implemented that way."
[00:02:50] <acdw> more like, missing the pointer, amirite
[00:06:55] <masterbuilder> artefact: yes, I understand what you meant, but some things are tricky or impossible to define, like, it's UB to access a shared resource with non-atomic operations and cause data races, the implementation cannot possibly define what happens if you attempt to do that, it's inherently unknowable
[00:07:14] <masterbuilder> multithreaded of course
[00:07:48] <artefact> whatever the implementation does is, by definition, how it's defined. might you be confusing it with deterministic?
[00:08:20] <masterbuilder> The compiler will happily oblige, but the actual behavior that occurs is not up to it
[00:08:27] <masterbuilder> so it can't define the behavior
[00:08:42] <masterbuilder> it's semantically meaningless
[00:08:51] <Catie> Could it be considered to be defined as a set of behaviors?

[00:10:46] <bkhl> function/struct signatures I guess I should say.

[00:12:10] <technomancy> it feels like inferring locals but not args encourages you to write longer functions
[00:12:11] <bkhl> Yeah, I used SML quite a bit in university and really like that model.

[05:21:55] <edrx> hi all!
[05:22:08] <edrx> a friend of mine is getting errors like this:
[05:22:10] <edrx> error in process filter: apply: Wrong number of arguments: (2 . 2), 3
[05:22:10] <edrx> error in process filter: Wrong number of arguments: (2 . 2), 3
[05:23:12] <edrx> I grepped for "Wrong number" in both the elisp files and in the C source files and I couldn't find that function that was producing these errors... any hints?
[05:24:20] *** Joins: G_SabinoMullane (~G_SabinoM@pool-72-94-251-236.phlapa.fios.verizon.net)
[05:26:31] <TRS-80> no wrong number of args, in other words some function looking for 3 args and getting 2 (or somethign like that)
[05:26:35] <TRS-80> edrx: ^
[05:27:07] <TRS-80> find the function and what args it takes, what is calling it, etc.
[05:27:28] <TRS-80> looking at debug trace should give a clue
[05:27:55] <TRS-80> maybe some package changerd, but that could be anything really, depending where it is coming from
[05:31:23] <edrx> why the dotted pair syntax?
[05:33:41] <edrx> a friend of mine told me that he is getting this error, but I haven't been able to reproduce it here... but I've alrealy seen errors like that - I was a bit intrigued by them, but I was able to fix the cause very quickly, and I didn't prepare a recipe for getting the error again...

[05:47:03] <pjb> edrx: M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET  try again, and check in the *backtrace* the function below the error signal-ing.
[05:47:43] <edrx> AHA
[05:48:04] <TRS-80> edrx: My guess is the function is being supplied a list, or an alist perhaps?
[05:48:34] <edrx> I found this in src/data.c:
[05:48:37] <edrx>   PUT_ERROR (Qwrong_number_of_arguments, error_tail,
[05:48:37] <edrx> 	     "Wrong number of arguments");
[05:49:49] <edrx> then I grepped the C sources for Qwrong_number_of_arguments and the occurrence in src/bytecode.c looked especially promising

[05:50:46] <edrx> here it is (smashed to a single line):
[05:50:49] <edrx> if (! (mandatory <= nargs && nargs <= maxargs)) Fsignal (Qwrong_number_of_arguments, list2 (Fcons (make_fixnum (mandatory), make_fixnum (nonrest)), make_fixnum (nargs)));
[05:51:43] <edrx> so the (2 . 2) means two mandatory arguments and two optional non-&rest arguments

[09:42:45] <TRS-80> however the former seems more popular for some reason?

[16:03:49] <thblt> I've had a quick look at the source, and vertical-motion doesn't seem to care about the view. Which I guess gets recalculated only after the command returns, so too late for the second call to (window-start)

[16:05:45] <thblt> But putting redraw-display doesn't change anything, which is unexpected.
[16:06:07] <thblt> But same conclusion, window start reads a property of the window, which may be updated after the command.

[17:34:24] <Guest2998> I'm a package maintainer. With native-comp I'm getting warnings like `Warning: the function `-if-let*' is not known to be defined.` (`if-let*` is a macro from dash.el). What is the correct way for my package to declare this macro so that native-comp will work? I believe that this problem is causing other warnings about "malformed functions" and
[17:34:25] <Guest2998> ultimately leading to runtime errors being thrown when using the native comp (*.eln) files..

[21:00:09] <thblt> Let me check my config
[21:01:08] <thblt> No, the support is built-in.  You just need to call lsp

[23:31:46] <dcx> They both seem to do almost the same thing... Open a buffer with an email template in it. But they're separate modes defined in different files

[23:33:24] <johnjay> dcx: usually you can track the lisp file that provides a command when you do C_h f
[23:33:26] <johnjay> er C-h f
[23:33:37] <johnjay> hopefully the designer mentions in the top what the mode is for
[23:34:01] <johnjay> i know emacs has a bunch of modes for mail stuff

[23:41:41] <dcx> johnjay: It looks like one is from GNUS and the other is from sendmail, but they both do a very similar task

[23:46:43] <cvandusen> `mail' provides much more functionality. See its doc string compared to `message-mail's.

[23:55:41] <johnjay> i've always wondered if dired or maybe dired+ has WASD mechanics
[23:55:52] <johnjay> like where you just browse a directory tree with up down left right

[23:56:02] <johnjay> ncdu does that so i use that to quickly check out files but emacs probably shoudl
[23:56:31] <davemq> IIRC believe message-mode and `message-mail` is part of Gnus.  `mail` looks to be part of the RMAIL which IIRC is part of Emacs itself

[23:57:15] <johnjay> gnus is part of emacs
[23:57:37] <davemq> Gnus used to be a separate package
[23:57:45] <johnjay> i see
[23:58:03] <cvandusen> I somehow get the impression that the question was related to the qualitative differences between the two.
[23:58:18] <johnjay> that makes me wonder if any old elisp packages could be reworked with threads and such modern features
[23:59:14] <davemq> One way to understand differences and why similar functions exist is to understand their heritage
[23:59:57] <johnjay> true
