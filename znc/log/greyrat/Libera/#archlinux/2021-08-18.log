[03:18:05] <kevr> or discuss it
[03:18:14] <Scimmia> and since Jacki won't answer my question, it's pretty clear the answer is no and they're just here to cause trouble

[03:20:50] <Edu4rdSHL> mpan, oh merge, yes
[03:20:52] <Edu4rdSHL> :p
[03:20:57] <Jacki> speaking of software that should be in the repos... why there is not opensnitch ? its pretty known and stable...
[03:21:01] <ArchNoob> Thank you
[03:21:16] <Edu4rdSHL> !give Jacki why
[03:21:17] <phrik> Jacki: Because you touch yourself at night.
[03:21:22] <mpan> Jacki: because there is no one who wants to maintain it. Period
[03:21:24] <ArchNoob> mpan: :)
[03:21:43] <ArchNoob> Scimmia: It's currently installing
[03:21:50] <Jacki> ...
[03:21:53] <Scimmia> ArchNoob: glad to hear it
[03:22:07] <ArchNoob> super glad it worked!
[03:22:10] <Jacki> I'd like also librewolf
[03:22:17] <ArchNoob> I was so scared to update this machine.
[03:22:31] <mpan> Jacki: vote for them in AUR.
[03:22:48] <Scimmia> ArchNoob: that fear made you wait too long and caused all of these problems
[03:23:09] <Scimmia> well that and the partial update
[03:23:20] <ArchNoob> yeah, first it was terrible internet then came the long gap with fear
[03:23:31] *** Joins: zyga-mbp (~zyga@31.0.173.147)
[03:23:42] <ArchNoob> oh yes, the partial update on pacman
[03:24:31] <ArchNoob> also, legacy python packages
[03:24:46] <mpan> Frequent updates rarely cause any issues and, if they do, they are easy to roll back. Unlike having to roll back 2100 packages or find the culprit among them.

[03:25:18] <ArchNoob> yeah would be a pain
[03:26:12] <kevr> Jacki: This is a distro contributed to by many, many, many people worldwide, and most of them are not part of a company that forces them to maintain particular packages. most of the time, it's up to TUs to decide what packages they want to maintain, and they make quite good decisions for the most part.
[03:26:28] <kevr> It's not a place that just has a team that manages every single package.
[03:27:02] <kevr> of course there are some core packages that have responsibility, but with third party applications, it's really up to them.
[03:27:26] <kevr> "third party" meaning, not core to running Linux.
[03:27:47] <kevr> So when you come in here and ask that, you can pretty much answer the question yourself -- nobody wanted to.
[03:27:54] <kevr> not yet, at least.
[03:29:31] <Jacki> I thought it was a mistake like wrong name, when i havent found tenacity
[03:30:01] <Jacki> is it the main fork right ?
[03:30:09] <kevr> You can always offer to maintain the tenacity package.
[03:30:11] <mpan> Jacki: it’s irrelevant to this channel.

[06:37:57] <nij-> Hi! I have my config for rclone lying in `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`, and its encrypted version `rclone.conf.gpg`. I hope to push only the later to a public git repo. But I also hope that rclone is smart enough to ask me for the password to decrypt whenever that conf file is required.
[06:38:29] <nij-> I suspect there is a more general way to deal with this. Namely, a hook that calls gpg whenever a .gpg file's content is requested.
[06:38:36] <nij-> Q: Is there such a way?

[08:38:47] <SponiX> sounds painful, but will be quicker/easier overall -- just rip the bandaid off, and get it over
[08:39:24] <SponiX> your install is so broken right now, you could spend days/weeks attempting to recover it, and still not come out on top

[08:44:25] <SponiX> ... I do get a warning that some of my file attributes couldn't be backed up ... I think it is the stuff I have used sudo setfacl -R -m u:plex:rwx /run/media/sponix on
[08:45:12] <feinedsquirrel> Oh, just caught that you said you run it from "/root/", as opposed to "/" is there a reason for that?
[08:45:23] <SponiX> adikwok: Yep, pretty much... and if you are uefi/efi boot, you can actually cheat now and use the "archinstall" SCRIPT to do most of the install work for you LOL

[08:48:43] <saulosilva> I'm using nvm to manage node and npm vesions and when i try to install something with pacman or paru/yay that has node as a dependece it try to install node thought arch repo, how can i install the pkg without the node dep?  
[08:48:51] <SponiX> feinedsquirrel: that rsync command keeps just "adding to" and overwriting with whatever is newer. But if you have deleted something off of your system, it will still leave it in your backups dir forever

[08:50:34] <feinedsquirrel> yeah, makes sense, If it is a reasonably fixable problem, at your skill level should take "x" amount of time, if you haven't solved it by then, probably won't be able to in "reinstall time". I like that thinking. Yes, I was wondering if that was the result, from my previous attempts at understanding rsync. I like that behavior.

[08:51:49] * SponiX goes to his terminal to have a look
[08:52:15] <saulosilva> yeah "--assume-installed"
[08:54:30] <SponiX> <Nekomander> sponix, you can use: yay -S --mflags --skipinteg to skip the checks, if you REALLY REALLY trust them.
[08:54:34] <SponiX> from my notes
[08:54:39] <feinedsquirrel> saulosilva: also, maybe --nodeps --nodeps man says specifying it twice ignores all dep checks
[08:54:51] <SponiX> So I think it is something to do with "--mflags" options that you need
[08:54:58] <feinedsquirrel> oh, woops, you aren't using pacman explicitly
[08:55:28] <SponiX> feinedsquirrel: no, but he should still attempt that, as most of the paru/yay flags do carry over from pacman :)

[11:36:10] <madm1ke> I use `nmcli c u VPN` to activate my VPN connection. The NM openconnect dialog starts and connects fine (with a saved password). However, for a couple of weeks now, the GUI blocks for ~20 seconds, which is super annoying. Running openconnect on the command line is very quick though. Any ideas where I could look to debug things? The journal isn't helpful at all.

[14:23:21] <nij-> I'm doing things like `rclone --config <$(gpg2 --decrypt /path/to/secret)`, but what rclone expects there is really the path to the decrypted secret. How can i change my code so it does if safely?
[14:23:43] <grawity> your <$() doesn't make sense
[14:23:48] <grawity> are you looking for <(gpg2) ?
[14:23:54] <nij-> sorry, yes. i mistyped
[14:24:17] <nij-> I believe shell can do this with dark magic.
[14:24:22] <grawity> so what do you *actually* have?
[14:24:26] <grawity> do you have <() or $()
[14:24:50] <grawity> because <() gives you a path and $() doesn't
[14:24:51] <nij-> <()
[14:24:57] <nij-> oh really?!
[14:24:59] <grawity> yes
[14:25:19] <nij-> OK, then I don't really know what <() gives. Lemme look it up then.
[14:25:47] <grawity> it gives a path to a pipe (kinda like mkfifo), which is connected to gpg's stdout on the other end
[14:26:06] <grawity> now if rclone insists on being given a regular file instead of a pipe, there's no shell syntax for that
[14:26:18] <nij-> ERROR ~~ Failed to load config file "/dev/fd/63": seek /dev/fd/63: illegal seek
[14:26:18] <grawity> you'll have to use regular old magic (i.e. mktemp, rclone, rm)
[14:26:59] <nij-> I remember seeing a type of file system where the content of any file in it will not be loaded by other programs.
[14:27:08] <nij-> Does mktemp do that for me?
[14:27:32] <grawity> no
[14:28:50] <nij-> OK.. I think mktemp and rm are good enough for now. Thank you. If there's better way, I'd be happy to know too.

[15:26:23] <thrice> since Namarrgon asked for the output, I suspect he/she knew :>
[15:26:27] <grawity> mesa is split across a bunch of packages though, e.g. radv is separate
[15:26:52] <Freneticks> yeah but i don't try to modify package 
[15:26:53] <grawity> so it would be more useful to check *all* of them
[15:26:54] <jonathon> also, my command is pointless for a single package, i'm mixing it up with a general check on packages, and MrElendig's filter works better for that too -.-
[15:27:01] <grawity> and maybe sha1sum the files, pacman still doesn't check that
[15:27:20] <Namarrgon> Freneticks: how are you testing radv while amdvlk is installed?

[15:28:08] <Namarrgon> you overrode the default with an envvar?
[15:28:19] <grawity> hmm this reminds me, didn't amdvlk have some layer that completely broke the usage of VK_ICD_FILENAMES?
[15:28:32] <grawity> it was on blogs last week

[15:31:35] <grawity> the same which makes radv segfault here, apparently

[17:02:31] <grawity> mpDris2 can show notifications from mpd (or presumably mopidy as well, if it's mpd-compatible) but it gets the album art from mpd itself, normally

[17:03:41] <low-key> never heard of mpdris2
[17:03:57] <low-key> the reason i'm using bum is because i'm using mopidy-spotify
[17:04:28] <sQVe> low-key: I'm doing something sort of similar with my lock script. I run things after clear things after I've locked it, ie. gpg etc.

[17:04:51] <grawity> hmm would be easy to just patch the musicbrainz support from bum into mpdris2 itself
[17:05:03] <grawity> next to where it gets cover art from id3, etc
[17:05:04] <sQVe> Line 10 + 13 are the interesting lines here.
[17:06:59] <low-key> that's perfect!
