[01:52:40] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ IO::Async::Loop - core loop of the IO::Async framework - metacpan.org ]
[01:53:06] <daemon> I should probably start lower down the chain
[01:53:09] <xenu> !m IO::Async::Process
[01:53:12] <daemon> how do I get two sessions with async
[01:53:13] <xenu> perlbot !m IO::Async::Process
[01:53:14] <perlbot> xenu: https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Async::Process
[01:53:18] <daemon> I have been using POE for ten years
[01:53:22] <Grinnz> there's no sessions
[01:53:23] <xenu> it's weird it's prefixed with !
[01:53:34] <Grinnz> you just add the things you want to the loop, and their callbacks do whatever you want them to
[01:53:38] <Grinnz> or futures
[01:53:57] <daemon> I think I have seen that
[01:54:00] <Grinnz> if you want things to reference each other, you just do that
[01:54:02] <daemon> then you can do a ->catch() for if it fails
[01:54:04] <Grinnz> with closures
[01:54:27] <daemon> POE seems way more easy to use or am I just old
[01:54:30] <Grinnz> yes, futures make it easy to combine behavior
[01:54:37] <Grinnz> you're just used to POE
[01:55:29] <daemon> not really I threw c#'s async in the shredder to and did ther thread management my self the same with rust and used mr queues >.>
[01:55:39] <daemon> seems I learned poe and stuck with that through all languages I learned
[01:56:05] <daemon> mpsc*
[01:56:15] <Grinnz> sessions are mostly necessary because POE relies on namespacing
[01:56:35] <Grinnz> without named events, or an architectural reason to use them, they're just overhead
[01:57:03] <daemon> I like fifo queues, I like to put work in a central location and have workers poll it, I also like each thread (or session) to have its own stack, can I do this with async
[01:57:14] <Grinnz> yes, use separate variables
[01:57:53] <daemon> can I create those stacks on the fly with no predefines ... sub add_worker(...) { .... }
[01:58:10] <Grinnz> i have no idea what you're asking
[01:58:16] <Grinnz> a stack is just an array
[01:58:46] <daemon> I will just give it a go, probably for the best - I managed to get mojo::lite working with an io::loop it should not be that hard to figure out async
[01:58:57] <Grinnz> if you're asking about a specific mechanism then you'll need to say what specific mechanism you're asking about
[01:59:52] <daemon> https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Async#SYNOPSIS
[01:59:52] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ IO::Async - Asynchronous event-driven programming - metacpan.org ]
[01:59:58] <daemon> that almost looks like a POE::Session
[02:00:07] <daemon> so I bet I could define multiple loops
[02:00:12] <daemon> could I communicate between them?
[02:00:12] <Grinnz> no
[02:00:18] <Grinnz> the loop is the kernel
[02:00:29] <daemon> ah
[02:00:37] <Grinnz> there's no sessions
[02:00:47] <Grinnz> that layer doesn't exist
[02:01:20] <LeoNerd> They're not required. That's an artificial thing created by POE
[02:01:20] <Grinnz> you can define multiple loops, but it's not useful for what you're thinking of, because only one of them can run
[02:01:37] <daemon> even with whatever is equivlent to wheel::run ?
[02:01:45] <LeoNerd> POE's events are just stringy names, like "got_thing".  If you have multiple connections or whatever, how do you know which is which? That's what the sessions are for
[02:01:46] <daemon> and Filter::Reference
[02:01:56] <LeoNerd> IO::Async just has different objects, uses just plain perl
[02:01:58] <Grinnz> a fork can run whatever it wants since the loop is not running there
[02:02:45] <daemon> Could I do this with async... Create a process that spawns a load of children as real processes that talk via stdin/stdout via Filter::Reference and have that central process do stuff?

[02:02:52] <LeoNerd> Yes
[02:02:57] <LeoNerd> You just·.. er.. do it.
[02:02:57] <Grinnz> yes, but just use IO::Async::Function because it does that better
[02:03:02] <LeoNerd> make lots of process objects, then do stuff
[02:03:13] <LeoNerd> You don't have to invent this artificial layer of a "session"
[02:03:30] <LeoNerd> You know how perl lets you call ->new multiple times on the same class of object, and make multiple instances of that object each with their own data?
[02:03:31] <daemon> dood I been using POE over 10 years its all I know gimme a break here I am trying to adapt! :P

[02:03:53] <LeoNerd> IaProcess->new( some args here );  IaProcess->new( different args here );
[02:03:55] <LeoNerd> Two processes
[02:04:02] <daemon> ok so I could make multiple loops, but I would need to select which one runs
[02:04:05] <LeoNerd> No]
[02:04:09] <LeoNerd> One loop. Always one
[02:04:15] <Grinnz> multiple loops are only useful for nested behavior
[02:04:20] <Grinnz> not for anything you're doing
[02:04:34] <Grinnz> you will just confuse yourself if you put anything in a different loop than the main loop
[02:04:35] <daemon> wait surely I can just run one loop of any event loop then select another (that is way out of scope for this convo but I would expect it)
[02:04:40] *** Joins: haj1 (~haj@ip5f5beb42.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[02:04:46] <Grinnz> "select another"?
[02:04:55] <daemon> yeah poe kernel tick
[02:04:58] <Grinnz> an event loop is a while(1)
[02:05:00] <daemon> you can have multiple kernels
[02:05:01] <Grinnz> there is no changing
[02:05:08] <Grinnz> there's just it running until it stops
[02:05:09] <LeoNerd> The Loop stores lots of state
[02:05:11] <LeoNerd> Looooads of state
[02:05:20] <LeoNerd> You don't want to swap about between them
[02:05:27] <LeoNerd> Make one Loop then stick to that for the entire lifetime of the process
[02:05:44] <daemon> one last question ... is it worth learning async (honestly asked)
[02:05:48] <LeoNerd> There's only multiple classes available, so you can choose whichever one (singular) is best for your situation
[02:05:49] <daemon> I know how POE works pretty damn well
[02:05:57] <daemon> what is the benefit of async
[02:05:58] <LeoNerd> E.g. GTK programs will need the Glib one
[02:06:07] *** Quits: fling (~fling@user/fling) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[02:06:09] <LeoNerd> You are talking about "async" like it's a specific thing
[02:06:11] <Grinnz> first of all, IO::Async is not "async", "async" is a general concept
[02:06:17] <Grinnz> IO::Async is a framework
[02:06:20] <daemon> yes the one I avoided in two otrher languages
[02:06:33] <daemon> in perl I would be looking to learn IO::Async to replace POE
[02:06:46] <Grinnz> it's worth learning if it's useful
[02:06:51] <Grinnz> dunno how else to answer that
[02:06:53] <LeoNerd> As with all things

[02:07:33] <daemon> POE has had no updates for ages
[02:07:45] <LeoNerd> The word "async" is so vague I wouldn't pay attention to specific comments like that
[02:07:45] <daemon> threads in rust and in c# are the same
[02:07:46] <Grinnz> sure, but that means many different tangentially related things
[02:08:05] <Grinnz> IO::Async can do a lot of those things, but some of them are different kinds of tools
[02:08:08] <Grinnz> like async/await
[02:08:11] <daemon> LeoNerd, all three languages literally call the methodology of promoses etc async
[02:08:12] <Grinnz> or futures
[02:08:14] <daemon> promises*
[02:08:15] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[02:08:22] <LeoNerd> Yes, they do
[02:08:39] <LeoNerd> That's because in those languages, that specific technique is the way to achieve async behaviour
[02:08:40] <Grinnz> async itself just means "code doesn't run in order"
[02:08:55] <LeoNerd> "a-synchronous" - without synchronisation
[02:09:04] <LeoNerd> The word *literally* means an absence of something else
[02:09:10] <daemon> I just do not understand why thread based processing (csharp/rust) or POE (perl) seems to be, being ignored ... what is wrong with it?
[02:09:16] <LeoNerd> A word that literally means an absence of a specific thing, can't very easily explain a precise concept
[02:09:20] <Grinnz> POE is not thread based
[02:09:23] <LeoNerd> The word is talking about the /absence/ of a thing
[02:09:32] <daemon> Grinnz, IO::RunWheel + Filter::
[02:09:34] <daemon> Reference
[02:09:36] <Grinnz> those are processes
[02:09:37] <daemon> you can make it so :)
[02:09:45] <daemon> I know but threads in perl are normally terrible
[02:09:45] <Grinnz> you can do process async in every event loop
[02:09:54] <Grinnz> i have no idea what distinction you're trying to make
[02:09:54] <daemon> processes is a safer alternative
[02:10:30] <daemon> I am trying to determine why across three languages, the development for the practise of 'async' is well "full focus", while the traditional methods are being almost forgotton
[02:10:39] <daemon> what metric makes 'async' and using promises 'better'
[02:10:41] <LeoNerd> Because overall it's just much nicer
[02:10:44] <Grinnz> better than what?
[02:10:47] <LeoNerd> I could write entire books abou ti
[02:10:54] <daemon> LeoNerd, one solid example will do
[02:11:02] <LeoNerd> Lack of race conditions

[02:11:12] <daemon> private memory rangers
[02:11:21] <daemon> -r
[02:11:22] <Grinnz> alright so my crystal ball says you're asking: why focus on cooperative multitasking (event loops, promises) over concurrent programming (threads, forks)
[02:11:25] <LeoNerd> Well there you go; you're listing some too
[02:11:27] <Grinnz> did i guess right?
[02:11:31] <choroba> callback hell
[02:11:40] <daemon> Grinnz, yep

[02:12:13] *** Joins: dsrt^ (~dsrt@wsip-68-227-92-38.mc.at.cox.net)
[02:12:17] <Grinnz> well, they're useful for different things - threading and forking is a workaround to turn blocking behavior into something that can cooperatively multitask
[02:12:30] <Grinnz> it's a waste of resources for tasks that are already not blocking
[02:12:40] <Grinnz> plus often a lot of complication
[02:12:57] <LeoNerd> Yah; mostly turns out that the blocking behaviour design of early POSIX and other OSes doesn't scale very well to large systems
[02:13:10] <LeoNerd> The "blocking behaviour" is mostly the "sync" that "async" is about the lack of
[02:13:13] <daemon> Grinnz, here is the thing, I could write a webserver, that also had an ircbot and also nipped off to do some shopping in POE; however if I wanted to do that shopping bit there might be an async module but all the POE ones are ancient and non maintained because no one does it anymore. Why is that?
[02:13:21] <daemon> Why is async getting the spotlight over POE
[02:13:28] <Grinnz> you keep talking about POE like it isn't an event loop
[02:13:29] <daemon> for perl that is, the argument is differnet for rust and c#
[02:13:34] <Grinnz> i'm very confused
[02:13:46] <daemon> its fine, never mind
[02:13:52] <Grinnz> what you were doing with irc and http was already cooperative multitasking
[02:13:55] <Grinnz> it was not threads or forks
[02:14:04] <LeoNerd> <daemon> Why is async getting the spotlight over POE  <== fundamentally don't understand this question
[02:14:07] <LeoNerd> POE is verymuch async
[02:14:11] <LeoNerd> That is its entire thing :)
[02:14:24] <daemon> LeoNerd, IO::Async should have been what I used there
[02:14:24] <Grinnz> when you use POE::Wheel::Run, then you're forking
[02:14:45] <Grinnz> which you can do with IO::Async::Process or IO::Async::Function as well
[02:14:56] <Grinnz> it's all quite analogous, except for the lack of the session layer
[02:14:56] <LeoNerd> What spotlight do you think is happening here?
[02:15:13] <LeoNerd> Is the summary of your question: has dngor stopped maintaining POE ?
[02:15:27] <daemon> LeoNerd, it just seems POE is slipping into history and I do not see why
[02:15:45] <LeoNerd> Perhaps because it's a weird shape. It's very disconnected
[02:15:56] <daemon> its very easy to use and very effective though
[02:16:00] <LeoNerd> In POE, you mostly use those named events for stuff
[02:16:12] <daemon> my ($kernel,$heap) = @_[KERNEL,HEAP];
[02:16:17] <Grinnz> the majority of people have not found it easy to use comparatively
[02:16:21] <daemon> yeah that is a bit weird, but POE::Session::PlainCall happened
[02:16:22] <LeoNerd> Take an object, and tell it when a thing happens to emit a named signal into a session, then in that session attach a CODEref to that named signal to contain the behaviour
[02:16:30] <LeoNerd> In almost any other event system, you attach the CODE refs directly to /the thing/
[02:16:36] <LeoNerd> No need for naming the events or sessions

[02:16:57] <daemon> but it makes a nice clear distinction on them
[02:16:59] <LeoNerd> That's also the same code shape that happens in almost every event system in almost every other language
[02:17:07] <daemon> you can also look up who called you and even where from
[02:17:32] <LeoNerd> Yah; and all of that is again layers of abstraction and complexity that almost no other event system has found it necessary to invent
[02:17:50] <Grinnz> 95% of programs have no use for 90% of POE's abstractions - and they affect performance as well as maintainability
[02:18:27] <daemon> so we should use select and filehandles? :)
[02:18:42] <Grinnz> what do you think IO::Async does?
[02:18:47] <daemon> all of them work like that
[02:18:49] <LeoNerd> If you particularly want. Though you might find that doesn't port very well to Windows,...

[02:19:23] <Grinnz> Mojo::IOLoop/IO::Async provide the features that programs using them have needed
[02:19:26] <daemon> but that is because of windows dodgy fork() I believe? something like that
[02:19:30] <Grinnz> there isn't much more to it than that

[02:20:00] <LeoNerd> E.g. if you want a nonblocking name resolver you'll find you have to recreate a lot of work that way
[02:20:09] <LeoNerd> Whereas most event systems will provide you one
[02:20:09] <daemon> I guess I just think the POE interface is really easy to use and friendly and im in the minority 
[02:20:19] <LeoNerd> I suspect because you're used to it
[02:21:07] <LeoNerd> Again, try rereading the earlier discussion about sessions and named events and so on. You were looking for the equivalents of those things elsewhere, when those concepts just don't exist - they don't need to

[02:59:15] <daemon> Building and testing IO-Async-0.79 ... FAIL
[02:59:28] <LeoNerd> BSD's poll refuses to believe that any language other than C exists, so it's not really possible to build event loop systems on top of it without risking large amounts of memory leak
[02:59:34] <LeoNerd> If they can fix that then maybe we can do this

[03:04:23] <LeoNerd> I'm getting really close to suggesting "Hey, I just won't test the resolver *at all*, and if the actual code doesn't work then sorry"
[03:04:43] <daemon> well if it does not work that is actually what you should say
[03:04:46] <LeoNerd> Almost every single test failure ever, is because some stupid OS or upstream DNS proxy or whatever has decided to invent stupid error codes for lookups
[03:04:52] <daemon> testing a rocking horse for stability seems silly
[03:05:14] <daemon> I can guarantee though this system has an absolutely rock solid resolve and upstream name system
[03:05:18] <daemon> its not even systemd
[03:05:21] <Grinnz> anyway since it's just that failure, you can run it with --force to ignore that failure
[03:05:22] <daemon> with no upstream proxies
[03:06:19] <daemon> infact it does not even have a local resolver, its just straight to a 2nd level nameserver lol

[03:29:18] <xenu> for example, cpanm used to break when it wound cygwin/msys tar.exe
[03:29:22] <daemon> mst, the answer is actually just to install everything into WSL2, instead of having python2,python3,perl,rust,c#,c++ installed in both WSL2(linux) and windows :D
[03:29:26] <xenu> it isn't such a big problem anymore because windows has its own tar.exe

[03:31:44] <daemon> xenu, you know what, nuts to this I am thankful to the help but I just don't give enough fucks to keep diagnosing this shit.

[03:31:56] <xenu> i like the .net languages, c#, f# even vb.net, but i'm not a fan of the ecosystem
[03:32:05] <xenu> especially because non-windows is still a third-class citizen
[03:32:23] <xenu> and their runtime is unpackagable because it downloads shit from the internet during the build

[03:54:17] <mst> I do plan to learn VSCode at some point though because I have ideas for plugins and it'll likely be easier to beat it into doing what I want than emacs

[03:55:55] <daemon> eh we see, that is more wandering into geeky fun fun rather than productivity

[03:58:04] <fuzzix> Well then, time to set up a Windows 98 VPS.
[03:58:05] <daemon> and then you can root/pass into it in a PXE ramdisk
[03:58:17] <daemon> :P

[03:58:58] <daemon> you could request KVM over the support channel though

[04:18:13] <Kassandry> Indeed.

[04:38:40] <xenu> genio: i'm not sure what your problem is exactly, but keep in mind there are two msys exectuables
[04:38:48] <xenu> one setups the environment for building apps for msys itself
[04:38:57] <xenu> while the other is used when you want to target windows
[04:39:05] <simcop2387> and when i'm avoiding that i'll also probably look at setting up msys2 again and trying to rebuild it in aarch64 piece by piece
[04:39:57] <simcop2387> 10 million iops per core (when given good enough hardware to be capable of it anyway).  so should be able to do all the fun sendfile() like stuff in perl for basically zero cost compared to every other event loop right now

[05:01:20] <mst> daemon: yes, that's why I said freebsd ports for the -perl-

[05:23:36] <daemon> Couldn't find perlbrew in $PATH
[05:23:44] <daemon> so it does require perlbrew behind it
[05:24:00] <mst> daemon: no it does not
[05:24:21] <mst> daemon: it doesn't build perls though
[05:24:38] <mst> daemon: you either give it a perl you already built, or a perlbrew perl name
[05:24:49] <daemon> alrighty let ,me bgrab perlbrew

[05:25:16] <daemon> was the only one 'clean'
[05:25:36] <mst> daemon: then the port is already superior for building a perl, so you tell ports to build you a 5.whatever, then plx uses that

[05:29:21] <daemon> this is a blank directory though
[05:29:34] <mst> so there's no deps for cpanm to find

[05:30:29] <mst> plx --cpanm -ldevel -n App::cpanminus App::cpm Carton Devel::Confess Data::Dumper::Compact
[05:30:41] <mst> that gives me a toolchain in the devel/ local::lib
[05:30:48] <mst> then my actual apps deps go into the local/
[05:30:49] <daemon> hmm what is data dumper compact never seen that one before
[05:30:55] <daemon> will take a peek
[05:30:59] <mst> (it includes devel/ local/ and lib/ by default)
[05:31:05] <mst> oh, that's my dumper

[05:31:42] <daemon> mhmm I never liked the $var = for Dumper never got why it could not return just a hash
[05:31:53] <mst> note, if you do 'plx foo', if there's a foo in dev/foo or bin/foo it just runs it
[05:32:09] <daemon> paul.webster@de1:~/NewProject $ ls
[05:32:09] <daemon> devel   local
[05:32:23] <mst> also if it's a shell script that -still- works because perl checks the shebang line and re-execs if it isn't a perl shebang
[05:32:39] <mst> also 'plx -MFoo::Bar ...' means 'call perl'
[05:32:46] <mst> (this is why the plx options are all --)
[05:32:52] <daemon> so its really a wrapper around perl with project locking
[05:33:08] <daemon> or project focus I am terrible with words

[05:33:40] <daemon> plx --cpanm -ldevel -n App::cpanminus App::cpm Carton Devel::Confess Data::Dumper::Compact
[05:33:45] <daemon> so for me that would be 'NewProject'
[05:33:54] <daemon> but I assume I could exec any project with that?
[05:34:02] <mst> also e.g. it sets up 'perl.spec' as well as 'perl' in .plx/
[05:34:13] <mst> the perl.spec is what you originally passed to set the config
[05:34:19] <mst> so you can safely rm the perl
[05:34:22] <mst> and commit the perl.spec
[05:34:36] <mst> and other users of the repo will get their perl5.<whatever>

[05:35:13] <mst> daemon: also if you do 'plx --config libspec'
[05:35:30] <mst> you'll see the 'devel local::lib, local local::lib, lib directory' thing is just an auto default
[05:35:43] <genio> When now running my latest    ./build.sh 2021Q4-genio __     with nothing but termcap in there I make it further than before
[05:35:52] <daemon> hmm it would be nice if vscodes' workspaces, your plx files and all the other tools would use use <project-root>/.meta/
[05:35:54] <mst> so e.g. you can use 'plx --config libspec add ...' to add an adjacent repository

[05:36:29] <mst> sec
[05:36:54] <daemon> nah mate even if you could get plx to do that, it needs everyone to play ball

[05:38:35] <mst> daemon: you can see how for stacked projects that's kinda handy
[05:39:28] <daemon> so I assume you can 'hop projects' in one command; plx project xx-xcllocal.11
[05:39:29] <daemon> for instance
[05:39:38] <daemon> and it just puts you in the project root with env correctly set
[05:39:42] <simcop2387> i love hackernews sometimes.  wanted to see where someone who was commenting worked (because they were talking about neat stuff) instead of an email or name or anything, there's a brainfuck program to go run to get that
[05:39:49] <mst> daemon: nah, it just works of $PWD
[05:39:59] <daemon> I see, interesting!

[05:40:36] <daemon> mst, what happens if you have a process that executes another, that would be using your active login session - so if it swaps to another applications working directory will that also inherit the correct envs?

[06:21:19] <daemon> the mathematician sleaves do show though :)
[06:21:36] <mst> this is why I burn through random source code so fast while debugging
[06:23:03] <daemon> I doubt many people would do it, but it would be fun to get a survey of the channel on 'their style of development'
[06:23:17] <daemon> see if there is any correlation the language has drawn the majority too
[06:23:42] <mst> but yeah, I ended up writing the user account provisioning code
[06:23:56] <mst> and became defacto responsibly for the mail, web and DNS servers in the process

[06:24:41] *** Joins: rwp0 (~rwp0@user/rwp0)
[06:24:43] <mst> honestly I loved it
[06:24:51] <daemon> how/why
[06:26:08] <mst> building stuff that could take one of the smtp boxen out of the rotation, blow away all the spam in the queue, bring it back in, then migrate to the next ... that was controlled entirely by flag files on a shared nfs store so there was no actual controller machine required ... was amazing fun
[06:26:58] <mst> my first ever published piece of open source software was an open relay detector plugin for qmail
[06:27:33] <daemon> ooh have not heard of qmail for a while I expected sendmail
[06:27:59] <daemon> the very little I have played about with mail, I did enjoy exim
[06:28:05] <mst> we didn't get attacked much until we'd switched from freebsd to qmail
[06:28:08] <mst> gah
[06:28:14] <mst> freebsd sendmail to solaris qmail
[06:28:23] <mst> I did get to live debug qpopper on freebsd though
[06:28:32] <daemon> well freebsd's sendmail was used by lots of multinationalks for a long long long time
[06:28:49] <daemon> I bet some still use it now
[06:28:52] <daemon> even ms used it at one point
[06:28:57] <mst> management had told me I wasn't allowed to admit they'd made a mistake, and they weren't sure they could roll back
[06:29:21] <mst> so I debugged the pop3 server via a binary search by adding/removing a full stop from the end of its standard error message
[06:29:26] <mst> got it back up within an hour
[06:30:25] <simcop2387> mst: i will never understand the love some people have for qmail given that it basically doesn't do anything without third party patches and then you lose the supposed security benefits of it.
[06:30:40] <mst> then told the manager who'd deployed the broken version that if he ever redeployed the mail platform without talking to me first again that he'd be explaining his decisions to the board of directors
[06:31:16] <mst> simcop2387: that's because the security thing was never the point and you don't understand qmail at all
[06:32:00] <simcop2387> mst: not accordign to DJB, 
[06:32:28] <mst> simcop2387: you asked about the love people have for qmail
[06:32:34] <mst> simcop2387: don't move the fucking goalposts
[06:33:09] <simcop2387> mst: every single one that i've met that goes on about it always brings up how it's supposed to be the most secure because djb wrote it to be
[06:33:13] <mst> simcop2387: I once took an exchange server from dying on its arse regularly with all CPUs pegged even when it was happy ... to running at 10% CPU usage ... with a vanilla qmail install and a couple dozen lines of shell
[06:33:24] <mst> simcop2387: because it's unixy so you can just bolt pipelines together
[06:34:05] <daemon> night all ;) 4am is curtain time for me!
[06:34:09] <mst> simcop2387: so you met a bunch of stupid people. welcome to the internet. qmail's unixy-ness is still why it's awesome in the hands of somebody who knbows how to wield it.
[06:34:43] <simcop2387> mst: this wasn't on the internet, it was multiple people i've worked for

[06:38:42] <daemon> I am going to sleep just adding here to emphasize the fanboy thing ;)
[06:40:24] <simcop2387> mst: i do wish i could get any MTA setup to do masquerading stuff (i think that was the term), i.e. sort of like *@cpan.org but it rewrites the address so that when you reply it goes through the @cpan.org MTA to then go out to the real recipient, so that your real address isn't directly exposed, and so that the entire domain is just a forwarding scheme.  i'd love to give some people @perl.bot
[06:40:30] <simcop2387> accounts
[06:41:01] <simcop2387> daemon: i think that's less fanboy and more people looking for suckers
[06:41:08] <simcop2387> at least in that particular case
[06:42:09] <simcop2387> oh neat, i didn't know any of their models did 2.4 and 5g at all.  i thought it had ended at 802.11n 2.4
[06:44:06] <tm604> postfix makes that config relatively easy, although you'd normally drag a database into the mix just for fun
[06:44:20] <mst> simcop2387: I could probably make exim do that
[06:44:23] <simcop2387> tm604: yea i've failed twice at getting it working for some reason
[06:44:52] <simcop2387> mst: don't think i've seen anyone mention exim for it at least.  i'm guessing by munging stuff with perl in between it?
[06:45:05] <mst> simcop2387: in between?
[06:45:26] <simcop2387> mst: receiving and re-sending
[06:45:41] <mst> simcop2387: exim embeds a perl binary, you can do anything you want inline inside the mail server
[06:46:06] <genio> Anyone see anything obviously stupid so far in that? https://gist.github.com/genio/517e2790593d7193b69e68060e2260fb I've got errors in there but I'm not yet sure why
[06:46:07] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ MSYS2 Setup · GitHub ]
[06:46:30] <simcop2387> that sounds like it'd be doable then.  i'd probably want to do what postfix does and add some kind of signature to the new from address so that i could detect someone trying to use it as a relay that way then
[06:46:31] <mst> genio: 'mst trying to comment on windows' would be obviously stupid I'm afraid, but good luck
[06:48:29] <simcop2387> genio: do you happen to have anything else on that machine that might have included nmake or dmake or something? (i.e. a non-gnu make.exe) that's fucking up things?
[06:49:15] <genio> nope. plain build of win10 with nothing that should interfere
[06:49:44] <simcop2387> msys2's sh is bash right?
[06:50:28] <simcop2387> i might toss a 'set -x' at the top of the build.sh to see all the steps it does (and not just what's explicitly echo'd) 
[06:51:13] <simcop2387> might give some indication of a path being changed when it shouldn't be
[06:51:57] <simcop2387> and are you able to find a config.h from the readline's configure script? those are the only real things i can think of for that
[06:54:04] <simcop2387> genio: and for extreme paranoia during debugging build.sh, since i'm assuming it's buggy.  set -e and set -u also.  -e will make it exit on the first command erroring and -u on the first undefined env var
[06:54:22] <simcop2387> so set -eu # strict mode \n set -x # trace execution mode
[06:54:30] <simcop2387> beyond that i see nothing obvious

[14:44:49] <art1> HI, I am trying to install IO::Async under MS Windows, Strawberry Perl (v5.30.1, portable), but install fails with "POSIX fork() is not available". Any hints,how to fix this?

[20:23:36] <krismatrix> one thing my effort with DS and algo programming in perl has helped me immesnly was understanding how to do vanilla oop. It is actually very simple...I was totally making it way more complicated than necessary.
[20:24:16] <mst> it's worth understanding the lower levels, definitely, though actually using them directly isn't something one tends to need to do much
[20:24:26] <mst> but knowing how the tools you -are- using work is really nice
[20:26:17] <krismatrix> right.
[20:27:26] <krismatrix> plus...sometimes you get examples of concepts in other languages (usually in python or JS for things i normally looking for). So it helps to be able to translate to equivalent..before doing more fancier stuff.

[20:45:39] <krismatrix> really? I don't see what's so special about rust. Ppl do seem to love it. I think for me, it's the paradigm that the language is trying to be and solve that matters. Perl, JS, Python, Php..seems to all fall under a similar domain, and I happen to like perl the most. Sadly..with data science, i have to use python.

[20:48:23] <cjac> oh, sorry.  I guess that's not obvious :-)
[20:48:54] <cjac> my role is support for big data at google.  most of the cases that come in have to do with java and python.  some scala.
[20:49:02] <cjac> I think perl is a better fit in many cases.
[20:49:48] <cjac> once the google cloud api libraries are implemented in perl, customers could submit their dataflow, dataproc, bigtable, bigquery jobs with perl.
[20:50:05] <krismatrix> So you work for google directly or are you saying you are contracted (or something else) with google?

[20:54:47] <krismatrix> Let's say I want to do something super simple, like draw a bar chart...i'd go for matplotlib/python over perl.
[20:54:48] <cjac> oh, yes.  those libraries are a bit more robust and offer a lot of stuff that doesn't exist in cpan
[20:55:19] <cjac> hmm.  it's been a while, but I liked Imager
[20:55:42] <krismatrix> i thought pdl did them. But I haven't invested too much time with it.

[20:56:54] <krismatrix> I take it you are not working on that. But you are working on more data analysis broadly.
[20:57:00] <cjac> but maybe once folks are able to launch big data jobs with perl, they'll want to prefer staying with perl instead of system()'ing their way in to python3 for the libraries...

[21:05:26] <krismatrix> oh...don't worry about that. 
[21:06:03] <krismatrix> Some api documentation feels complex to me. So I am trying to find out the best way to learn it. But sometimes, you just gotta do it.
[21:06:32] <cjac> before you can implement google-cloud-perl, though, you'll need an implementation of google-auth-library-perl and https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby

[21:10:05] <krismatrix> I don't know how to answer you question. Let me try to explain how i think..and see if this gives you context. When I used nexmo (a twilio like sms api), they had curl/wget commands which you could request...and provide a callback url. I would use this back and forth request/response to send an sms, but I would do the logical implementation in perl.
[21:10:43] <cjac> drive = Google::Apis::DriveV3::DriveService.new # ruby implementation
[21:11:09] <krismatrix> When I now look at api documentation..i often find examples in python or js. But I want to build it all in perl.
[21:11:31] <cjac> right.  so that's because we don't have a perl library.
[21:11:34] <krismatrix> without having to simply shell out to python/js.
[21:11:36] <cjac> I would like to develop one
[21:11:45] <cjac> the team that does this for ruby is here in Seattle
[21:11:52] <krismatrix> ah.
[21:12:01] <cjac> so I figure I can piggyback on the work they have done recently (just released!)

[21:13:37] <PapaChub> Can anybody think of a way to figure out whether I'm running inside bash(1)'s "cat <(myProg)" ?
[21:13:41] <PapaChub> For whatever reason, on my system [macOS 10.14.6; perl 5.18.4; brew readline 8.8.1] the following:  cat <(perl -MTerm::ReadLine -E 'Term::Readline->new($0)')  hangs (and "lingers" after ^C) under Term::ReadLine::Gnu
[21:13:47] <PapaChub> But "perl -M... | cat"  and  "cat < <(perl -M...)"  (Note the extra '<' redirection) both work fine, so "-p STDOUT" isn't enough...
[21:14:06] <cjac> PapaChub: maybe you can find your ppid?
[21:14:20] <PapaChub> `getppid()`, sure...  But then?
[21:14:36] <cjac> is it bash?
[21:14:58] <cjac> if not, is its parent bash?
[21:15:11] <cjac> if not, is its parent systemd/init/1?  if not not, is it bash?
[21:15:22] <mst> PapaChub: why not check '-t STDIN' to see if you're attached to a terminal or not?
[21:15:22] <Grinnz> PapaChub: it sounds more like you want to know whether your program is attached to a tty, because there's lots of other ways for it not to be
[21:15:29] <Grinnz> what mst said
[21:15:41] <mst> PapaChub: you seem to be trying to 'solve' a different problem than the one you have

[21:17:49] <PapaChub> (I'm at the crossroads of "corner case" and "edge condition"...)
[21:17:59] <Grinnz> opening a tty doesn't have anything to do with what STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR are
[21:18:40] <Grinnz> if your problem is more complex than "check if i should prompt the user for input", please elaborate

[21:27:01] <fizzie> <(command) doesn't use a temporary *file*, it just expands to a /dev/fd/N entry connected to the command in question's stdout.
[21:27:16] <Grinnz> well, still technically a file because unix :D
