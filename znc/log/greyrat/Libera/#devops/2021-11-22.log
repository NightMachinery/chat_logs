[12:45:39] <Cl0udNinja> does anyone have any alternatives to packer, packer doesnt work for me because the method for getting our images to a provider (IE: aws/gcp/azure, etc) involve using a surrogate system, and creating an image from the secondary disk attached, instead of the vm that packer would stand up. we cannot get around this for reasons.

[18:16:50] <shad> anyone here using Hashicorp Vault ?
[18:17:46] <shad> We've started based on my impulsion to move from big-ass servers hosting multiple clients to c5.medium aws instances provisioned via Terraform
[18:19:14] <shad> so there's an EC2 instance per client and 1 ssh key per ec2. We're starting to have a bit too many ssh keys to keep track off, and i was looking for solution to managed them and i've seen that Hashicorp Vault is a thing. Would putting my keys in that allow me to delete keys from my laptop and retrieve them whenever I want to ssh to an EC2 via the vault ?
[18:19:37] <shad> i've seen in the docs commands like "vault ssh.." would that populate the ssh key automagically ?
