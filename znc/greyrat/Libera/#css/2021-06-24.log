[21:59:35] <scara> You make me want to punch you!
[21:59:36] <entuland> considering that that seems to be a file repo for their own use, the ability to be accessible from the terminal may be one of their very first requirements :P
[21:59:49] <hassoon> entuland: meh that's silly
[21:59:49] <scara> Yea exactly
[21:59:57] <hassoon> we are in 2021
[21:59:58] <hassoon> what the heck
[22:00:07] <scara> I doubt you checked but there is a file in /README.txt ...
[22:00:13] <hassoon> i know terminal browsers, i'd used them
[22:00:19] <scara> https://foxes.are.not.allowed.org/README.txt
[22:00:21] <entuland> I did check the readme there, that's why I stated the above :P
[22:00:29] <hassoon> nowadays you do have major browser like firefox and chrome
[22:00:40] <scara> Just wanted it to be a little pretty, sometimes I access this from school to show off my things
[22:00:42] <entuland> firefoxes are not allowed, didn't you read the URL?
[22:00:43] <entuland> :P
[22:01:06] <hassoon> entuland: meh even sillier
[22:01:10] <entuland> eheheh
[22:01:18] <scara> Actually the name comes becuse of the non not varient
[22:01:25] <scara> lemme see if I have the archived page
[22:01:43] <scara> https://lainsafe.kalli.st/files/162455590002692.php
[22:01:56] <scara> (scroll to bottom)
[22:02:04] <hassoon> scara: just get yourself an ssh server and access it from your school son, you're not supposed to make web development a terminal concern
[22:03:35] <scara> Ah yes just allow anyone to ssh into my computer, what could go wrong
[22:03:59] <hassoon> scara: what? no, ssh'ing into your computer does require a username and a password
[22:04:16] <scara> You don't get my use case
[22:04:41] <entuland> I guess you want to share some of those files with others as well
[22:05:13] <hassoon> scara: okey you can make yourself and old-school website, that you need to access your files, i see that
[22:05:57] <hassoon> if that's what you're up to, then okey, thougth i'm up to making a full-blown digital library of a set of videos of yours
[22:06:17] <scara> I like the terminal (lol you're literly on irc too) and I want to access my files from other places too, everyone has a web browser now adays so thats a easy way to access files too
[22:06:38] <entuland> scara, for the records, you could make it so that the same URL gets served in different ways depending on the UA or something, so that it looks nice and comfy through a browser _and_ it still gives you the snappy desired data via terminal, or something
[22:06:56] <hassoon> scara: i do use terminals on a daily basis, in fact terminals are the life of my daily computing, but web development should not be reduced to some terminal child play
[22:07:04] <scara> Sounds like more work
[22:07:17] <entuland> sure, if you don't need it, keep doing just the parts that you need
[22:07:36] <scara> I belive the web should be html+css only (with attribyes prefered)
[22:07:58] <hassoon> scara: nope, javascript is the ultimate programming language of the web
[22:08:08] <hassoon> scara: if you only want html and css, then you'll only make static websites
[22:08:17] <entuland> you're free to implement your own pages for your own consumption the way it fits better for your needs and available time to implement them
[22:08:22] <hassoon> scara: which..fit for your use cases.. terminals
[22:08:27] <wovixo> Lol, what the heck is going on in here. Good lord.
[22:08:39] <scara> 90% of the web relys on javascript and its a security flaw, before you argue that: https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html
[22:09:01] <hassoon> scara: nope, you just need to know what you're doing when writing javascript code, that's all
[22:09:13] <hassoon> scara: flaws are when you write bad code
[22:09:22] <entuland> na, not going to chip in on such a pointless debate, in particular not on #css, I bail out
[22:09:37] <scara> Yea I'd too
[22:09:41] <hassoon> ?
[22:09:45] <hassoon> meh whatever
