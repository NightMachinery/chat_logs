[00:00:09] <skye0> you see, ubisoft is in a position of power
[00:00:41] <skye0> if bureaucracy means rapists in the organization can hide, they should be targeted
[00:00:46] <evilgohan2> So, first off, cancel culture doesn't exist.
[00:00:49] <evilgohan2> There, I said it.
[00:01:22] <evilgohan2> Secondly, I'm from the outside speaking in. That's not "Common sense", it's just me applying my limited knowledge. I have no idea what the corporate structure of Ubisoft is nor its internal politics.
[00:02:21] <x10> sure but don't be suprised when they ban someone during their presentations skye0 
[00:02:21] <evilgohan2> I'll give an example: I had a boss who was known to be extremely verbally abusive, and would frequently sexually harass men and women i nthe workplace. He did it as a Tier 2 tech, he did it as a manager, he did it and was promoted to director, and he did it and was promoted to VP.
[00:02:47] *** Joins: Nickname (~Nick@62-210-77-13.rev.poneytelecom.eu)
[00:02:51] <evilgohan2> It was known to EVERYONE there that he was a toxic individual, and he would commonly refer to himself as a quote-"Walking HR Nightmare"
[00:03:00] <evilgohan2> Yet, he was continuously promoted.
[00:03:02] <skye0> x10 they're in the wrong, really. they employ and recruit others by nepotism, they should fall by nepotism
[00:03:08] <evilgohan2> If you ask HR, they knew nothing about it.
[00:03:11] *** Nickname is now known as Guest7358
[00:03:20] <x10> fall by nepotism.... I .. ok.
[00:03:37] <evilgohan2> But the company still allowed it to persist, and promoted him despite the behavior - giving the impression that it was not only known about, but tolerated so long as he continued to "produce"
[00:03:49] <Stormscape> "fall by nepotism" what does that even mean?
[00:04:16] <skye0> they're associated with scumbags and are protecting their reputation and revenue source
[00:04:35] <evilgohan2> So, just becuase the principal didn't know does not mean that power structures present didn't allow it to persist; and to that point, the principal should have at least caught an inkling or a hint. But, by that same notion, if the principal does not know, they cannot necessarily be blamed for what they don't know
[00:04:36] <evilgohan2> HOWEVER
[00:04:44] <evilgohan2> the principal CAN be held accountable for the culture they fostered
[00:04:52] <evilgohan2> and that's not cancel culture
[00:04:54] <evilgohan2> it's accountability

[00:06:30] <x10> cause that is what skye0 started with, nobody is denying that ubi had/maybe still has internal problems with assholes getting in powerpositions.
[00:07:40] <skye0> What any organization with power says they should act upon. E3 shouldn't have platformed them at all, but I doubt they're gonna even do that. This is a symptom of what's wrong with society - trample on the marginalized to chase the almighty dollar or supposed salvation.
[00:08:21] <x10> nobody is marginalizing the victims in that case
[00:08:23] *** Joins: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa)
[00:08:37] <evilgohan2> so, with regards to E3, remember that - first and foremost, E3 is not for the public. E3 is and always has been an industry conference. There was a time where the conference itself was not even open to the general public, and you could only get a hint as to what was occurring from reading media outlets.
[00:09:08] <evilgohan2> Ubisoft is a member of that industry, and funds it as do others.
[00:10:10] <evilgohan2> The point there being: expect an industry of scummy corporations to be an industry of scummy corporations.
[00:10:34] <evilgohan2> and no: there are no "good" game publishers. CDPR is not your friend. Bethesda is not your friend.
[00:10:43] <evilgohan2> VALVe is especially not your friend.
[00:11:08] <x10> exactly they're just trying to make a buck.
[00:11:12] <skye0> x10 it's sort of like showing Epstein's face on the news directly towards the survivors, especially when they were young
[00:11:27] <skye0> evilgohan2 at this point any business is bad business
[00:11:49] <x10> what? because an employee did something wrong, the business can't do anything in public anymore?
[00:11:50] <skye0> i only give them money because i'm too paranoid and/or lazy to pirate games
[00:12:03] <skye0> x10 especially if they're at a position of power
[00:13:19] <x10> 15 years ago one of my collegues was arrested at work, (pedo), should my factory close down now or what? never advertise anymore?
[00:15:17] <x10> ubi booted out the people involved. you can bitch all you want at them, don't be surprised if they don't like it and act upon it by banning 
[00:15:37] <evilgohan2> I wouldn't say that, but it's not great either. The point I'm really trying to get across by saying that is to discourage fanboyism, and to remind people that game companies are game companies.
[00:16:04] <evilgohan2> It's always amazing to me when I look back on things: VALVe has never run a single advertisement at any point over the past decade
[00:16:18] <skye0> x10 at least i don't have to put up with e3's and the game industry's bullshit by virtue of being banned. best stuff isn't always mainstream
[00:16:30] <evilgohan2> But everyone *always* knows when a Steam sale is upcoming, or even makes videos for them.
[00:16:41] <evilgohan2> people literally evangelize Gabe Newell
[00:16:44] <evilgohan2> That's fanboyism.

[00:18:02] <x10> well good for you sky, remember to vote with your wallet
[00:18:11] <evilgohan2> As for Ubisoft, if they indeed removed _that_ toxic elemeent, then that's about it.
[00:18:44] <evilgohan2> However, when it comes to channel moderation - particularly on Twitch, I'm going to be honest: I'm not surprised you were removed in the slightest; and, if I'm being honest, if I was a channel moderator in that scenario, I might have removed you too.

[01:05:50] <chazy> i mean the difference is quite noticeable if you count as all 8 channels maxed out would be 6144MB/s, pcie2 x8 is 4000MB/s, pcie 3 should be double, right?

[08:41:54] <riff-IRC> Another late night chasing odd bugs or cleaning up the remains of another catastrophic RAID array failure?
[08:42:02] <KevinCarbonara> neither
[08:42:23] <riff-IRC> /s
[08:42:31] <KevinCarbonara> been helping this girl get out of an abusive relationship. We went and got a restraining order on Monday, tomorrow we go to the police department to report the multiple violations
