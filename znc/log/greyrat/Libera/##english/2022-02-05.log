(British spelling, Canadian spelling, Irish, South African, Australian and New Zealand) Alternative spelling of center https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/centre
[05:51:14] <ouzel8___> Can someone explain the ideas behind the alternative American spelling of centre which is center?
[05:52:45] <ouzel8___> Additional do we consider these nuances more broadly a dialect?
[05:52:54] <ouzel8___> Additionally,*
[05:58:01] <LjL> nothing to do with dialects since it's simply writing conventions that do not correspond to any pronunciation difference
[05:58:04] <LjL> dialects are not about writing
[05:58:52] <LjL> things like "center" are parts of the attempted spelling reform by Webster that was partially successful
[05:59:05] <LjL> although many of the spellings he proposed had been in more or less common, if not exclusive, use before
[05:59:29] <ouzel8___> Alright, then instead dialects are specific to spoken language?
[06:02:03] <LjL> https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/noah-websters-spelling-wins-and-fails/win-center
[06:02:06] <LjL> yes
[06:02:32] <LjL> these fall under the umbrella terms of "orthography" or "spelling conventions"
[06:02:51] <LjL> sometimes how a word ends up being spelled is *influenced* by a dialect's particular pronunciation of it
[06:02:58] *** Joins: Alexer (~alexer@alexer.net)
[06:03:01] <LjL> but that is not the case for center vs centre at least
[06:03:33] <ouzel8___> Is this the same with other words with alternative American spelling such as color, mom, etc?

[06:05:03] <LjL> largely yes
[06:05:24] <LjL> but again for the most common "changes" that Webster actually managed to convince people to adopt, those spellings had already been used before
[06:05:32] <LjL> he made some much more radical changes that weren't really adopted
[06:06:33] <LjL> anyway his ideas centered around simplifying spelling and making it more "phonemic", although it is often considered that his attempts in that direction were somewhat misguided (for example, "color" takes away phonetic clues that "colour" has)

[06:32:06] <ouzel8___> Did the variant spellings that were used prior to these reforms exist because of the same reasons e.g. phonemic spelling, or perhaps etymological reasons?
[06:32:20] <LjL> they existed because English spelling is a mess
[06:32:47] <LjL> there is no one obvious way to write a word based on how it's pronounced, so some words were written in a given way for etymological reasons, but others wrote them in a different way due to how they perceived them
[06:33:05] <LjL> we have a bunch of original signatures by Shakespeare where he spelled his own names in a lot of different ways
[06:33:11] <LjL> "Shakespeare" wasn't even the most common
[06:34:30] <LjL> variant spellings also arose by analogy
[06:34:38] <LjL> you write "enter", so why write "centre" and not "center"?
[06:35:07] <LjL> (not that people were necessarily making a conscious argument like this: they just did it instinctively because our brain copies patterns it already knows)
[06:35:41] <LjL> (although the dictionaries of the era were definitely making opinionated choices)

[09:04:40] <kurahaupo> Me-me: it's not that it was any more or less "concrete", but rather that it was more parochial and divided into (much) smaller communities. So in a metropolitan area, one expected a wider range of accents from "native speakers", and a wider range of writing to the varying pronunciation.
[09:05:06] <Me-me> I think you may be referring to the diversity of dialect.
[09:05:23] <kurahaupo> definitely

[09:06:20] <kompowiec> I use words regardless of dialectical origin.
[09:07:11] <kompowiec> although usually it's probably american english, even despite the fact that in Poland they teach British.
[09:10:48] <kurahaupo> kompowiec: the variation of word selection between dialects probably isn't as marked as the changes in pronunciation & grammar, taken as percentages, though it's probably larger in absolute terms.
[09:12:09] <kurahaupo> it might be something along the lines of 98% of words shared (39000 out of 40000) vs 90% of grammar rules (a few hundred) and 80% of phonemes (several dozen)
[09:13:46] <kompowiec> meh I can't speak English because I don't have no one, recently I spoke to some other non-native speaker.
[09:14:29] <kompowiec> in any case, the pronunciation of English is irritating with countless homophones.
[09:15:31] <kurahaupo> kompowiec: most English dialects do not use negative concordance (a negative verb reinforcing a zero quantity), though some certainly do. (In particular, none of the prestige dialects do)
[09:16:40] <kurahaupo> "I don't ... noone" -> "I don't ... anyone" or "I do ... noone"
[09:17:50] <kurahaupo> Generally the dialects that use negative concordance use the negative verb form "ain't", as in "I ain't got none".
[09:18:43] <kompowiec> it remind me issue in article in which they complain that english don't have Standard Way of Answering Negative Questions.

[10:19:17] <kompowiec> as far as i understand, double negation arises as a result of ESL interaction, because I do not see in the pages about grammar clearly the exceptions in which they can be used (one of the theories says that in colloquial speech it is okay)

[13:17:21] <Lebela> thank you, energizer 
[13:17:30] <Lebela> I wasn't that sure myself, too
[13:17:51] <energizer> s/too/either/ :)
[13:17:51] <chat> energizer thinks Lebela meant to say: I wasn't that sure myself, either
[13:19:08] <Lebela> mhm... thank you, energizer 
[13:19:20] <Me-me> jemius: You could construct "To be maximally precise, [...]" or simply, "To be precise, [...]"
[13:19:25] <Lebela> would you please tell me why "too" is wrong in this case?  I am an eager to learn
[13:20:22] <energizer> hmm, i don't have much experience explaining /why/ things are the way they are. lemme think
[13:20:34] <Lebela> because it's a negation, maybe?
[13:20:47] <energizer> yes that's it
[13:20:51] <Lebela> just a gut feeling, I might be wrong
[13:21:00] <Lebela> but with a positive statement, I feel like "too" would work well
[13:21:01] <energizer> "i do too"; "i don't either"
[13:21:11] <Lebela> yeah, and then we have "neither", too ;)
[13:21:30] <Lebela> I never quite managed to wrap my mind around the difference between "may" and "might" and "either" and "neither"
[13:22:08] <Lebela> Whenever I think I got it,  some native speaker uses one of these words in a way that I didn't expect
[13:22:12] <energizer> "neither x nor y" means "not (either x or y)"
[13:22:45] <jemius> Me-me, that sounds cool, thx
[13:22:48] <Lebela> can I use it exactly according to the rule you laid out above?
[13:22:55] <Lebela> please allow me to try it myself:
[13:23:28] <Lebela> "I don't like spinach either"  <== either, because the word "don't" contains the negation so "either" remains positive
[13:23:56] <energizer> right
[13:24:13] <Lebela> either:  =>  A: "I don't like spinach"   B:  "Me neither"   <==  neither,  because no negation preceding the word "neither"
[13:25:29] <Lebela> yes / no / yesn't ?
[13:25:58] <energizer> yeah i guess "me neither" expands to "neither you nor i like spinach". "me neither" is a special colloquialism though
[13:26:10] *** Joins: LimeOn (~user@user/limeon)
[13:26:16] <energizer> it means "i don't either"
[13:26:28] <Lebela> it would be correct, though?
[13:26:56] <energizer>  A: "I don't like spinach"   B:  "Me neither" is normal spoken english
[13:27:05] <Lebela> thank you
[13:27:09] <Lebela> how about may and might?
[13:28:51] <energizer> hmm
[13:29:12] <Lebela> back in school, they taught us that "may" is being used in situation where one expects a positive answer to a query, whereas might should be used when the answer is expected to be negative
[13:29:19] <Lebela> but real-life spoken English seems to deviate from this rule
[13:30:33] <energizer> you mean in "may/might i have a glass of water"?
[13:31:39] <Lebela> I would have to go over my notes, but in movies, there are many situations where native speakers use might and may
[13:31:51] <Lebela> not only in these textbook examples as "may I have a glass of water?"

[13:32:48] <energizer> Lebela: i have an idea
[13:32:54] <Lebela> hear, hear! :)
[13:33:12] <energizer> first of all, the difference is very subtle so you could easily use them interchangeably
[13:33:29] <Lebela> that is good to know
[13:33:41] <Lebela> but in order to step up the game, I should master these subtle differences as well
[13:34:02] <energizer> but i think "may" is more like "it is possible that" and "might" feels more ...probabilistic
[13:34:10] <energizer> i should probably google it 
[13:34:17] <Lebela> "he may/might not be the brightest, but at least he's honest."
[13:34:20] <Lebela> may or might?
[13:34:36] <energizer> either 
[13:34:42] <Lebela> that's what I felt
[13:34:53] <Lebela> I tried both, and both sounded okay to me
[13:35:20] <Lebela> "It might/may  rain today" ?
[13:35:35] <Lebela> I feel like I would say "might" if there is a chance,  but it's not sure
[13:35:42] <Lebela> and "may" if I am very sure of it 
[13:36:07] <energizer> no
[13:36:14] <Lebela> dang
