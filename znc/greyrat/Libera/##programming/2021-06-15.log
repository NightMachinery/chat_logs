[00:13:02] <oldlaptop> the short version is that it's based on the B-tree family; tables are normally a B-tree with the "rowid" (which is a 64-bit integer, and possibly but not necessarily the user-visible primary key) as the sort key, and indices are also b-trees with arbitrary sort keys. (Tables can be stored in the index-type b-tree too, but that needs to be explicitly requested in the database schema.)

[00:17:59] <oldlaptop> SQLite is quite unusual in that it actually does store SQL code in the database file - but only for the schema
[00:19:55] <oldlaptop> that is, your `CREATE TABLE "foo"(a, b, c);` gets stored in the database, along with some important details like where the root page of that table's b-tree is, and sqlite parses that whenever it opens the file

[03:12:19] <Twix> pay off in which way? Money? Faster Development? Faster Software?

[05:52:09] <guest3278> hi. im using a while loop in c++ to check for invalid input. The loop runs if the user entered a negative number or a number over 50 but doesn't work with letters. How would i prevent letters from being entered? https://bpa.st/T44A

[12:18:13] <AndroidDAW> ok :)
[12:18:32] <pikapika> Add a printf inside the copy constructor to verify

[14:12:22] <pikapika> *idea
[14:12:40] <AndroidDAW> for example, the viewport properties might simply be rotation matrices and translation matrices
[14:13:03] <AndroidDAW> eg to rotate the camera, and move around the scene
[14:13:38] <pikapika> The camera is an independent entity as I said
[14:13:46] <AndroidDAW> yes
[14:14:00] <pikapika> Associated with a camera is a point (the point the camera is) and the location and size of the viewing screen

[14:14:44] <pikapika> this camera should be rigidly taken wherever you need it
[14:14:49] <pikapika> Remember 
[14:14:55] <pikapika> The camera isn't just the point where the camera is
[14:15:09] <pikapika> It is also the screen which is always located at the same place relative to it
[14:15:17] <pikapika> ie the whole pyramid is a rigid body
[14:15:45] <AndroidDAW> ok
[14:15:49] <alycidyne> DPA: yeah, you can do sequential access atop random access by offering a fd which saves the position and IO functions which update it
[14:16:52] <AndroidDAW> an object needs to be places relative to this camera in order to be visible, right?
[14:17:11] <pikapika> An object needs to be inside the infinite pyramid to be visible
[14:17:13] <AndroidDAW> or at least present somewhere in the scene
[14:17:21] <AndroidDAW> yea
[14:18:19] <pikapika> AndroidDAW, observe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ViewFrustum.svg
[14:18:20] <Hitchens> Link: File:ViewFrustum.svg - Wikipedia
[14:18:22] <AndroidDAW> or rather... if an object is placed at center, then in order to remain at the center, its location must be offset my the camera's relative position right?
[14:18:29] <AndroidDAW> by*
[14:18:37] <alycidyne> Many things can then be expressed in terms of records. For example, directories are tables indexing inodes by name
[14:18:53] <pikapika> nothing will stay fixed if the camera rotates, except for points on the axis of rotation
[14:19:11] <alycidyne> Executables are tables indexing vars and functions by name

[14:20:06] <AndroidDAW> hmmm
[14:20:28] <alycidyne> even the disk allocations are tables indexing extent trees by inumber

[14:24:20] <pikapika> in your system, "record" is just a funny word for "struct"
[14:24:25] <pikapika> and not a very specific thing like database records
[14:24:57] <DPA> There are many ways to think about things. Everything is a file, everything is an object, everything is a table / db, etc. Generalisations are just a means to have a reusable interface, that's all there is to it.
[14:25:04] <AndroidDAW> if an object is placed at center, and i move the object up by 2, then the object should appear elevated right?

[14:27:06] <pikapika> alycidyne, a struct has a fixed size
[14:27:09] <alycidyne> pikapika: e.g. a directory entry is a row containing the name and the inumber, with the name being the primary key

[14:36:12] <pikapika> in theory
[14:36:13] <AndroidDAW> ok, so if i translate both my camera and my object by 1, my object does not appear centred, but instead as if the camera is translated by 0 and the object is translated by 2

[16:16:24] <PlanckWalk> A distance is not a vector
[16:16:32] <Tackwin> What do you mean by relative distance exactly ?
[16:16:34] <PlanckWalk> A displacement is a vector.  Distance is its magnitude.
[16:17:17] <vdamewood> In other words, a distance is a scalar.
[16:17:26] <PlanckWalk> So yes, the displacement of your object from your camera is (0,0,-10)
[16:17:38] <nitrix> AndroidDAW, In case it's not immediately obvious, the formula derived from the pytagorean theorem. The difference between the two Xs is the base of a triangle, the different between the two Ys is the height, which leaves the diagonal you're searching for, the hypotenuse.
[16:17:44] <PlanckWalk> The distance is the magnitude of that vector, using the formula I mentioned.
[16:17:56] <nitrix> AndroidDAW, It's the same in 3D, you just add a Z component.

[17:21:56] <PlanckWalk> (Well, except in trivial cases)
[17:22:23] <DPA> Interesting.
[17:24:05] <alycidyne> Okay so I guess my "filesystem" is really just a system-wide SQLite
[17:25:32] <PlanckWalk> At any rate, if there was such an X dependent only upon Y, then it works with Z=I, so X = Y.
[17:26:40] <PlanckWalk> But the only such matrices are multiples of I.
[17:27:21] <PlanckWalk> I.e. you need Y = k I for some scalar k.

[20:06:06] <bjs> gitesh: well,  like I said, + and += call different methods. The types can choose to do what they want for those two operations.  As far as Python is concerned they are totally unrelated operations and any type can do whatever it wants for either.
[20:06:59] <bjs> gitesh: but yes, most immutable types will just implement `+=` using `+` and everything will work as you expect,  whereas some mutable types make += mutate themselves (like lists) rather than using +
