[01:40:27] <f-a> ManofLetters[m]: https://github.com/UnkindPartition/ansi-terminal/issues/114 might interest you too
[02:10:41] <ManofLetters[m]> oh, does give any hope of accessing stdout from a Windows GUI application?
[02:11:26] <ManofLetters[m]> because until them, my ANSI frontend is dead on Windows 
[02:14:19] <f-a> mhh
[02:17:06] <f-a> what do you mean access? you cannot on Win?
[02:17:42] <f-a> that is weird even by Redmond standards
[02:17:48] <ManofLetters[m]> yep, I can't, because Windows finds out my application is compiled with SDL and bans it from accessing console
[02:18:00] <ManofLetters[m]> I complained about it to you
[02:18:01] <f-a> is there a good reason for that?
[02:18:38] <ManofLetters[m]> and I told you that it means that your Windows games always receive a console started especially for them
[02:18:46] <ManofLetters[m]> because WIndows sees that they are not GUI applications
[02:19:10] <ManofLetters[m]> in both cases it's done by Windows regardless if the program was started from icon or from terminal
[02:19:10] <f-a> meh, the sooner win dies the better
[02:19:21] <f-a> yeah I remember you telling me this
[02:19:32] <f-a> (and I remember a sense of relief!)
[02:19:41] <ManofLetters[m]> heh, so that was the flip coin of my tragedy ;)
[02:20:11] <f-a> the tragedy is programming a roguelike
[02:20:15] <f-a> a never ending task
[02:20:18] <ManofLetters[m]> haha
[02:20:23] <ManofLetters[m]> that's a bliss
[02:20:24] <ManofLetters[m]> never ending
[02:20:49] *** Quits: pwug (~pwug@user/pwug) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:21:01] <ManofLetters[m]> and there's plenty of 7DRL, seven-day roguelikes, so that's actually a choice
[02:21:17] <ManofLetters[m]> there is a yearly jam for 7DRLs
[02:21:23] <ManofLetters[m]> high quality
[02:21:38] <ManofLetters[m]> (meaning, the top winners)
[02:21:53] <f-a> I recall joeyh entry (scroll)
[02:21:57] <ManofLetters[m]> but some of them are then developed for years, too ;)
[02:21:59] <f-a> good one
[02:22:03] <ManofLetters[m]> oh, yes
[02:22:09] <f-a> that is the beauty of roguelikes
[02:22:19] <f-a> I do not ¬´fancy¬ª them but the depth in unequalled
[02:22:53] <ManofLetters[m]> yeah, simulation is deep and is rabbit hole and is a game design anti-pattern

[02:23:49] <sm> meanwhile at the shallow end.. ANSI colors FTW!
[02:24:08] <ManofLetters[m]> üéâ
[02:24:23] <f-a> A story!
[02:24:34] <sm> the background effects are from Terminal's silver aerogel them, can't do those in ANSI alas :)

[02:25:05] *** Joins: pwug (~pwug@user/pwug)
[02:25:24] <f-a> soon we will be able to gauge FPS of caverunner, I am curious
[02:25:34] <sm> that will be great!
[02:25:43] <sm> I appreciate your work f-a
[02:25:51] <f-a> no, *I* appreciate your work
[02:25:54] <sm> I know these are deep rabbit holes
[02:26:09] <ManofLetters[m]> no, I appreciate your work, both of you
[02:26:28] <sm> no no, Man of Letters it is we who...
[02:26:38] <f-a> hehe

[03:56:13] <f-a> sm: (et al. too)
[03:56:33] <f-a> say I have a datatype like  data Env = Env CurrTermSize CurrFPS
[03:56:48] <f-a> where would you use that?
[03:57:05] <f-a> In the s -> Event -> s logic function (which would become Env -> s -> Event -> s)?
[03:57:18] <f-a> or in the draw one (which would become Env -> s -> Plane)?
[03:57:20] <f-a> Or both?
[04:01:17] *** Joins: tzh (~tzh@c-24-21-73-154.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[04:04:16] <ManofLetters[m]> my instinct would be to be to keep drawing minimal; FPS can be used not only for drawing, but also, e.g., to tune the granularity of simulation, so it has an effect on logic
[04:06:13] * f-a nods
[04:06:27] <f-a> also i dc'd, so if there are more messages than yours, please repaste!
[04:06:32] <f-a> yes it is what I thought
[04:09:28] <ManofLetters[m]> no, only my message
[04:41:58] <sm> I agree, I can stash it in game state for drawing. Though, everyone will do that, since you want to show it
[04:42:53] <sm> so.. both ?
[04:56:21] <f-a> thanks for the feedback
[04:56:47] <f-a> whenever I need to take a decision on an interface I spend way too much time

[05:50:46] <f-a> ohhh that is a very good layout!
[05:50:56] <f-a> tho speed = 60 is inhuman
[05:51:13] <f-a> what was default? 20?
[05:51:53] <sm> 15 is default
[05:52:54] <sm> for you or anyone else who played earlier versions, it should be showing your old scores
[05:53:19] <sm> you can reset by `rm -f ~/.local/share/caverunner/log`
[05:53:57] <sm> and `rm -f ~/.local/share/caverunner/{state,scores}` I guess
[05:54:18] <f-a> I always rm -rf‚Äôd the folder before trying a new version, don‚Äôt know why
[05:55:02] <sm> haha all that sweat making it migrate all old data formats, and probably the one person who'd notice wipes the files every time :)
[05:55:22] <f-a> hehe
[05:55:41] <sm> but anyway it'll totally be worth it for future evolution. I might discard the oldest migration code. 
[05:56:09] <f-a> it is a *fun* game, so if you get on discourse and reddit you slightly lower productivity @ FPcomplete and other haskell firms
[05:56:20] <sm> it's impossible to complete caves at speed 60. This is the Dark Souls of cave diving games. B-)
[05:57:01] <sm> I hope it'll get more so. I'll do an announcement at 1.0
[05:59:08] <sm> unfortunately cave 1 is a bastard. I'm thinking of replacing it.  :)
[06:00:59] <f-a> need to sleep not, happy coding and may all divers reach the centre of the planet
[06:01:43] <sm> thanks, good night f a
