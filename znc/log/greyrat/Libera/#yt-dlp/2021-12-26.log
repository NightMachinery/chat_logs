[15:06:40] <Snuupy> I'm trying to download https://www.ondemandkorea.com/transferring-love-e12.html, looks like I get a video file (with only video) and an audio file (with only audio). Looks like I need ffmpeg to merge them together, let's try this again
[15:07:25] <Snuupy> ah yep needed ffmpeg
[15:07:31] <Snuupy> ffprobe comes with ffmpeg it seems
