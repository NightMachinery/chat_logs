[03:12:02] <stevecam> @Rudde, you could suspend the first script by pressing Ctrl+Z, you will see the terminal say something like "[1]+  Stopped", you can do the same for the next script but you may decide to run that like "./script &", this will place the script in to the background on execution automatically, you will see something like "[2] 56789" in your terminal, this is not suspended an is still running, however your first process was suspended with the "Ctrl+Z"
[03:12:03] <stevecam> keypress so you may want to bring it back in to foreground, type in "fg 1" to resume that said process, "fg" by itself will bring the last job in to the foreground so noting the number after an application is suspended or when an application enters the background is helpful

[03:34:03] <stevecam> Personally I like Xen for performance, but KVM is an attractive option too
[03:34:59] <inlight> Is KVM better than Xen?
[03:35:00] <inlight> Xen tends to be more stable. It is older, is more mature and offers near native drivers for OSs like Microsoft Windows, whereas KVM is weaker in those regards. However, KVM does very well when you compare Linux vs Linux against Xen. ... Until 2014, very few people had the confidence to use KVM as a real-world solution.

[06:27:41] <rm_rf> Can anyone think of a reason why it would be a bad idea to clone an encrypted drive without decrypting it first? Yet, even if the goal were to decrypt first, I'm not sure that's even possible using something like Clonezilla as it is my understanding the the OS cannot be running during the clone process. If the OS is running, there are syscalls being made and if syscalls are made, a static clone
[06:27:43] <rm_rf> isn't possible ...
[06:29:10] <rbox> rm_rf: bytes are bytes...
[06:29:23] <rm_rf> Yes
[06:29:26] <rbox> if its block encryption, you just decrypt the block device, and not mount it
[06:29:42] <rm_rf> Bytes are bytes and even encrypted bytes represented readable bytes once decrypted

[06:31:53] <rbox> well like i said... bytes are bytes... so no one is gonna stop you from cloning the encrypted bytes
[06:32:06] <rbox> if its block encryption, then decrypt the block device, then yu ahve a descrypted block device, and you can cone that as well

[09:34:45] <meingtsla> loganlee[gnu]: https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/file-tutorial.html#file-tutorial documents the use of -f- to mean stdin/stdout. Also, "tar --show-defaults" may show -f- as a default option so that's why you may not need to explicitly specify it.

I guess maybe, resize partition, format/setup new partition with btrfs+luks , copy active partition with rsync to new luks-btrfs, do some updates to grub etc.. , and then delete unencrypted btrfs, and resize
[13:44:49] <marsbar> <marsbar> max ? something like that? not sure on exact steps. if someone has a guide or alternative to do this, i.e. luksipc (live in-place)... very much appreciated.

[14:17:55] <hexnewbie> u0_a174: There are two ways to suspend: suspend to RAM, suspend to disk. The latter is called hibernation, and requires an extension for GNOME to be able to do it.
[14:18:15] <phogg> I'll third that. If you're not measuring you're just guessing.
[14:18:31] <hexnewbie> KDE calls suspend to RAM “sleep”

[14:19:14] <hexnewbie> u0_a174: Xfce doesn't think that displaying an extra button is confusing for the user, so it should have a “Hibernate” button
[14:19:22] <hexnewbie> Rather, a menu entry
[14:19:23] <phogg> Most places seem to agree that "to RAM is sleep" and "to disk is hibernate." The former is easier (more likely to work) but requires power to maintain.
[14:19:37] <u0_a174> hexnewbie: yeah it does, as long as you have swap
[14:19:43] <phogg> hexnewbie: why does GNOME need an extension? Just for the button?

[14:21:42] <phogg> in the GNOME world there should just be one button: shut down. It should suspend to RAM, and then when power is low it should automatically wake up then suspend to disk. Obviously there is no way the user could want to control that.

[15:29:18] <jim> oh, ok. well, lclint could do a static analysis of your code, and can be helped by special comments meant to inform lclint where there are allocations that don't begin and end in the same function, with no function calls inbetween
[15:29:31] <MeanEYE> That sounds useful.
[15:30:02] <jim> the project went away, but another forked it, so something is available
[15:30:04] <noze> jim: Sorry, but I don't see how that clarifies my question. Let me rephrase: It seems that there are 6 registers available for passing arguments. They are can't be assumed to be saved across calls. Why aren't these same registers also used to return results?

[19:47:17] <coder7of9> woudl you recommend running firwalld also
[19:48:11] <Dagmar> Perhaps you should do more reading.
[19:48:26] <Dagmar> "Firewalld" is just an interface for automatically generating iptables rules
[19:48:42] <Psi-Jack> Well, Netfilter rules more specifically.
[19:48:49] <Dagmar> It's not really a daemon in the conventional sense
[19:48:52] <tangy> firewalld is an abstraction layer ...yeah.  ^that
[19:48:58] <coder7of9> yes plus its own configurations in xml
[19:49:06] <coder7of9> okay
[19:49:24] <akik> coder7of9: that blog post is wrong with that

[23:00:09] <ayecee> maybe there's other differences too.
[23:01:00] <tirnanog> it's mainly because because word splitting a command substitution is asking for trouble. even if it was your intent to split on IFS, each resulting word could be subject to pathname expansion if it looks like a glob. if you do want to split on fields, you can use read instead.
[23:01:19] <tirnanog> in particular, bash offers the -a option for read, which will assign fields directly to an array.
