[00:00:09] <johnjay> you'd have to do it on a different account for safety i think like as root
[00:00:14] <johnjay> but migh be worth a try
[00:00:44] <johnjay> emms is an old module and possibly could have some assumption 27 broke
[00:00:55] <kenran> johnjay: don't know if I get you right, but maybe something like `emacs -Q -l path/to/init.el? don't know how well that does in case you have multiple files
[00:01:15] <johnjay> no it's easier just to mv .emacs.d to .emacs.d.old
[00:01:24] <johnjay> then use an empty one. or do it on the root account
[00:01:33] <johnjay> that way you dont' risk destroying your packages
[00:01:34] <dale> I usually just "mkdir /tmp/lol && HOME=/tmp/lol emacs" for testing.
[00:01:49] <johnjay> emacs tests everything relative to $HOME?
[00:02:30] <dale> I believe user-emacs-directory gets set to $HOME/.emacs.d.  (I don't know if the newer .config stuff comes into play here, but even if it does I suspect $HOME is still used.)
[00:02:33] <kensanata> I'm using EMMS right now and I use GNU Emacs 27.1
[00:02:44] <johnjay> kensanata: and you never had problems setting it up?
[00:02:49] <kenran> I guess as soon as it has determined the path to its .emacs.d (usually in $HOME), everything using user-emacs-directory will work
[00:03:01] <johnjay> kenran: do you know if emms tries every media player you have?
[00:03:05] <kensanata> johnjay: Well... I probably did when I started.

[00:04:01] <kensanata> johnjay: This is the setup I use on all my machines.

[00:04:27] <kenran> dale: for science
[00:04:50] <johnjay> his emms-player-list had everything
[00:05:04] <johnjay> so i couldn't tell if it was like. calling mpg321 which then fails then goes to next file
[00:05:10] <kenran> (I wouldn't be very surprised if it still found the "canonical" home directory)
[00:05:11] <johnjay> or if it's calling first mpg321, then vlc, then ogg then etc
[00:05:36] <johnjay> that coudl jsut be it
[00:05:42] <kensanata> I must confess to being attracted by gopher://thelambdalab.xyz/1/projects/emus/
[00:05:46] <johnjay> instead of failing to find mpv it's finding it but giving it the wrong args
[00:06:00] <johnjay> then it probably doesn't even check the return result and silently fails
[00:06:01] <kensanata> "While there are plenty of amazing options, I've never found an emacs music player that I've been terribly happy with. Generally I find the existing fare far too complex for my taste. Thus I've followed the usual path of the unsatisfied programmer and hacked together my own package, which I call emus (in honor of the amazing curses-based player, cmus)."
[00:06:01] <kensanata> "It requires exactly one dependency: mpg123. Everything emus does is via this program. If mpg123 can't do it, neither can emus. Because of this, emus will only ever play mp3 files: no ogg, etc. This keeps things simple."
[00:06:03] <johnjay> (just guessing)
[00:06:55] <dale> When HOME="", Emacs seems to use the CWD for home.
[00:07:14] <johnjay> well yeah. it would just append paths to HOME which is empty right
[00:07:43] <kenran> dale: that's actually good to know for testing :)
[00:07:55] <johnjay> so it's HOME="" emacs 
[00:07:56] <johnjay> ?
[00:07:59] <dale> The weird thing is that user-emacs-directory is still "~/.emacs.d/".  (dired user-emacs-directory) opens $PWD.

[00:08:58] <johnjay> Osugi: ok good luck. mpv has a great interface by the way
[00:09:08] <johnjay> maybe it did and just has a fallback

[00:13:07] <dale> johnjay: You're asking about the value of my XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable?
[00:13:17] <dale> I don't have that set.
[00:13:26] <kenran> johnjay: I'm pretty sure ~ expansion is shell-dependent
[00:13:56] <kenran> In bash at least it expands to $HOME, yes
[00:13:56] <dale> Emacs is expanding ~ itself.  See the source for expand-file-name, I believe.
[00:14:09] <dale> I have just seen this function's source and it is... very long.
[00:14:17] <lisp123> I'm just cleaning up my .emacs and adding some annotations. Does anybody know what (require 'package) does?
[00:14:21] <kenran> dale: oh wow, Emacs will never stop surprising me :D
[00:15:42] <dale> kenran: Keep in mind that the variable user-emacs-directory is set to the literal string "~/.emacs.d".  In order for Emacs to delegate that to e.g. the shell, it would have to spawn a whole other process, and it wouldn't even be cross-platform then, so it's practically a necessity that Emacs contains the code to expand ~ (just like shells contain this code).
[00:15:50] *** Quits: acdw (~acdw@user/acdw) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[00:16:04] <kenran> dale: good point!
[00:16:16] <dale> kenran: You are generally correct, of course (or at least AFAIK), that running a shell command with ~ will generally be expanded to $HOME.
[00:17:22] <kenran> dale: I think I remember tcsh not doing that (or maybe it was another one). On a work laptop I got my boss had made this the default shell and this was where I tripped
[00:17:51] <dale> kenran: Hm, it's been a long, long time since I ran [t]csh but I am surprised it doesn't expand ~.
[00:18:05] <dale> kenran: Your boss was clearly playing a prank on you, though, by trying to make you use tcsh.
[00:18:25] <dale> lisp123: It (most likely) loads Emacs's built-in package.el if it hasn't already been loaded.
[00:19:02] <kenran> dale: looking back, I wonder whether that was a test, yes :D
[00:19:38] <dale> I think this is the code that causes Emacs to treat an *empty* HOME as CWD: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/c92444b4ba3b134378fe3deb7c040bef6b9fab54/src/fileio.c#L1908-L1918
[00:20:07] <dale> If you entirely unset HOME, looks like Emacs will (on *nix) try to retrieve the user's home directory via getpwnam/getpwuid.
[00:20:19] <lisp123> dale: Thanks!
[00:21:21] <johnjay> dale: looking at normal-top-level it seems emacs looks at $XDG_CONFIG HOME
[00:21:44] <johnjay> then it tries a a few things to set user-emacs-directory and does ~/.emacs.d if they all fail
[00:22:22] <johnjay> for example if .config/emacs exists it sets it to that
[00:22:28] <kenran> I'd love to debug my "variable without a name" problem further, but I cannot really isolate it yet... it has to do with mu4e, but I can only make it "visible" by using some combination of consult/helpful/vertico (I'd have to narrow that down).
[00:22:36] <dale> johnjay: Looks about right.
[00:22:47] <johnjay> if ~/.emacs.d exists it prefers that
[00:23:19] <johnjay> i didn't know emacs expanded ~ itself?
[00:23:22] <johnjay> i thought bash did that

[00:32:13] <dale> kenran: You said you know how to trigger it?
[00:32:58] <kenran> dale: Yeah, or at least I think I do: I have to start mu4e once; after that, it appears when I do C-h v, bound to helpful-variable
[00:34:08] <kenran> Bisecting my setup with respect to that is hard though, as mu4e is a bit finnicky. With more time, I'd probably start over with an empty config, pull mu4e, helpful, vertico, consult in and try to get a minimal mu4e config where it appears. But after that point I think I wouldn't know how to advance
[00:35:13] <dale> kenran: I have a theory that something is calling (abbrev-table-put nil :parents [whatever]), and that nil should actually be an abbrev table but it isn't.

[00:36:27] <kenran> dale: oh, that's above my head, but I might try doing something like that on startup to see if it accomplishes the same

[02:11:38] <debbpointe> Hello, I have a general question about emacs: if you pull codebase that is huge, i heard emacs lags. is that true?
[02:11:39] <johnjay> even mwm from the 1980s does
[02:11:55] <parsnip> macos uses s-TAB
[02:11:57] <johnjay> the name of the software is "alt-tab"?
[02:12:05] <bpalmer> debbpointe: what  do you mean by "pull codebase?"
[02:12:15] <dale> johnjay: Maybe it's called AltTab.  I dunno.  https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos/

[02:13:28] <dale> parsnip: What does alt-` do on Linux?

[02:13:42] <bpalmer> debbpointe: very large files aren't dealt with tremendously well; but, in particular, very long *lines* inside a file cause emacs to become very slow

[02:14:22] <parsnip> dale: it's Windows that simply uses M-TAB to cycle through all possible "frames" or windows
[02:14:30] <dale> parsnip: Interesting.  I assume that depends on whatever GUI stuff you're running.  It's been a long time since I ran a Linux desktop, I feel like that must be a newer thing.
[02:14:40] <parsnip> yeah i'm handwaving the DE part
[02:14:59] <parsnip> but i would wager it's behavior on gnome for starters
[02:15:14] <parsnip> and xfce, unity, mint, ...
[02:15:16] <dale> parsnip: "Back in my day" alt-tab on Linux was pretty much alt-tab on Windows.  There wasn't this distinction between "apps" and "windows of the app" that macOS makes (which annoys me to no end, having been brought up on Windows).
[02:15:36] <parsnip> yeah, i too, find it weird

I recently upgraded my server runing gnus from debian 10 to 11, so from emacs 26 to emacs 27, and gnus doesn't start anymore with "gnus-read-init-file: Error in ~/.gnus: Cannot open load file"; it's probably some old stuff in my config that doesn't work with modern gnus, but it doesn't say which line/part of the file breaks, and --debug-init doesn't help either, do you know how I could troubleshoot
