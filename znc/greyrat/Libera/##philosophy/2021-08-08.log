[07:04:01] <Samian> We all buy and do things for ourselves, houses being one of the larger purchases

[07:11:46] <plank> intergenerational conflict is a driving force in culture

[07:18:54] <plank> youre probably right about that

[07:47:05] <plank> people who were not able to reap the rewards of being born into an era where real wages were much higher and the cost of homes, schools, cars, etc was much lower should be compensated by those who were

[08:00:27] <Samian> when baby boomers were in their 30s they could buy a house much cheaper (inflation adjusted). What do you suggest happen about that fact?
[08:00:39] <plank> i suggest we tax them
[08:00:46] <plank> more than we currently are

[08:02:34] <derpadmin> my roomate had a good idea yesterday
[08:02:46] <derpadmin> a 10M$ cap on assets
[08:02:58] <derpadmin> seems... quite allright with me
[08:03:05] <plank> not bad for a first draft
[08:03:21] <plank> very difficult to enforce tho
[08:03:26] <Samian> plank  so it's harder for a 25 year old to live now than it was 50 years ago?
[08:03:37] <plank> the UK hasnt had much luck enforcing their wealth tax
[08:04:05] <Samian> I'm in AI / machine learning, so maybe what I'm seeing is skewed, but recently wages have been skyrocketing. Next year I'll be making 600k, a 6x increase in my salary from 2 years ago
[08:04:14] <plank> samian yeah. they pay more in rent, are paid less in real wages, and cannot escape this cycle without a sudden windfall
[08:04:26] <plank> yeah, that would skew your perceptions a bit
[08:04:38] <plank> the rich generally dont like having their money taken from them
[08:04:51] <Samian> plank  so I was under the impression that the efficiency new technology has brought meant that megacompanies had a lot more money to practically give away
[08:05:04] <Samian> plank  look at the pandemic. The government literally gave money away
[08:05:07] <plank> they do. but thats not what they do with it
[08:05:16] <Samian> The supply of USD increased 20% in 2020
[08:05:18] <plank> they tend to reward their shareholders before they reward employees
[08:05:19] <kmh> <Samian> plank  just be happy the boomers didn't get the world destroyed <---- so that we get a chance to do it?
[08:05:34] <Samian> in a single year, the supply of US currency went up by 20%..  Let that sink your minds!
[08:05:57] <plank> meh
[08:06:11] <plank> im in favor of inflation. its a natural wealth redistribution mechanism
[08:06:32] <Samian> plank I'm seeing more money being given away now than 10 years ago.   There was a bill recently passed giving parents 500/month per child. Something like that

[08:18:00] <kmh__> with amazon is was vice versa and still is a bit
[08:18:14] <Samian> plank  if your competitors are paying their employees 50 USD / hour, you can't say you'd be forced to pay your competitors 80 USD / hour
[08:18:29] <Samian> plank  not only that, but facebook is a very lax companies. Amazon works their software engineers to death
[08:18:35] <plank> i dont know the labor market for AI researchers that well, but im skeptical of your framing
[08:18:50] <Samian> plank  facebook is paying significantly more, and letting their employees work significantly less...
[08:18:59] <plank> mainly because it reads as bootlicking for your capitalist overlord
[08:19:01] <Samian> plank  look on levels.fyi
[08:19:13] <Samian> facebook E6 engineer makes 600k a year total comp
[08:19:26] <kmh__> Samian,  yes bbut they have a different business model imho
[08:19:30] <Samian> at google, the equivalent level is 487k total comp
[08:19:37] <plank> and the contractors?
[08:19:51] <Samian> at amazon, the equivalent level is 330k total comp
[08:19:52] <kmh__> there is less profit for them in working employees to death
[08:20:37] <plank> you know, the people who work at facebook while facebook goes to great lengths to avoid employing them directly?
[08:20:43] <kmh__> Samian, no the more interesting thing would be look at the number of employees at that given level
[08:21:07] <kmh__> Samian,  i suspect facebook has way less than google or amazon
[08:21:16] <plank> naturally the market for the bourgeoisie is going to be distorted when compared to the market for lesser paid labor
[08:21:16] <Samian> kmh__  probably it depends on how much they work their employees to death. It's one of those "find the optimal point" optimization problems.
[08:21:41] <Samian> kmh__  similar to the supply-demand X graph where the intersection point is the optimal price.
[08:22:11] <Samian> well, the problem isn't similar, but the idea of there being multiple factors and finding the optimal point is what's similar
[08:22:17] <kmh__> Samian, yes but it is not just about finding the optimal point to handle your workrs, but simply where your profit comes from
[08:22:20] <plank> so youre not concerned with the plight of your fellow workers samian?
[08:22:32] <Samian> plight?
[08:22:32] <plank> or is that you dont see them as fellow workers
[08:22:41] <kmh__> Samian,  facebook main busines model is polemically speaking fucking over customers
[08:22:59] <plank> yes, the contractors who must pay silicon valley CoL while earning ~1/10 your salary
[08:23:00] <kmh__> Samian,  amazon's business model is fucking over employees
[08:23:01] <Samian> from what I'm seeing the tech giants have so much money that standards to get hired are being lowered because they don't mind dishing out more money to whoever wnats it
[08:23:21] <kmh__> Samian,  and i'd argue that partially reflects in the salaries
[08:23:31] <Samian> kmh__  yes yes I realize your point.
[08:23:37] <kmh__> ok
[08:24:48] <Samian> kmh__ To Zuckerberg, facebook employees are his family, and it's his family against the world. He cares for his family more than the rest of the world.   bonnie and clyde mentality.
[08:24:54] <plank> loooool
[08:25:12] <plank> man that must be some strong kool aid
[08:25:40] <Samian> kmh__  To Bezos, customers are his friends, and employees are the leeches.  He likes those that give him money. He hates those that take money out of his pocket.  Honestly, this is how most humans are.
[08:26:00] <Samian> Bezos's mentality is more humanly natural, but Bezos takes it to another level
[08:26:22] <plank> you cant make a man understand something which his salary depends on his not understanding, sadly
[08:26:23] <kmh__> Samian, well i'm not sure whether i agree with that ( i don't know enough about working at facebook), but i see your point and it might illustrate a different attitude at facebook towards emloyees
[08:26:41] <Samian> kmh__  dude you can see it in the salary.
[08:26:50] <plank> i understand the drive to rationalize the practices of your employer so that you dont feel like such a piece of shit working for them
[08:26:52] <kmh__> Samian,  i agree with Amazon assessment fully though
[08:26:53] <plank> been there, done that
[08:27:18] <Samian> I'll be making 600k next year. Of course I fucking love Zuckerberg and am thankful he's willing to share the wealth. I need it when houses now cost a million for a piece of trash
[08:27:26] <Samian> at amazon, I'd be making 250k max
[08:27:31] <Samian> efff bezos
[08:27:38] <plank> and you dont see the selfishness in this?
[08:28:05] <kmh__> Samian,  well sure the salary might be an indicator of that at facebook, however for that you can't just look at the salaries at certain tech level jobs, but you would need to look at general employees treatment
[08:28:23] <plank> ^^^
[08:28:24] <kmh__> including the non-tech jobs, lower tech positions, etc.
[08:28:44] <plank> judge a man not by how he treats his equals, but by how he treats the lowest in society
[08:28:55] <Samian> What I see is that zuckerb and bezos are both billionaires. Zuckerberg is sharing more of his wealth with his employees than Bezos is.  Bezos is a selfish keep-money-all-to-me person. Zuckerg is a let-my-people-enjoy-some-of-what-I-got person
[08:29:15] <kmh__> Samian, i'm also not quite convinced of zuckerberg wealth sharing argument
[08:29:18] <plank> great, zuckerberg is the worlds tallest midget
[08:29:25] <plank> who fucking cares
[08:29:36] <kmh__> for that you cannot simply look at the salaries you compare
[08:29:42] <Samian> Zuckerb is 5'8. That's average height man
[08:29:48] * plank facepalms
[08:29:58] <Samian> even benefits, Zuckerberg wins
[08:30:02] <derpadmin> the 600k thing is fun...
[08:30:06] <plank> benefits _for you_
[08:30:06] <kmh__> Samian,  he meant zuckerberg is tech midget :-P
[08:30:13] <derpadmin> how much a janitor is paid at facebook?
[08:30:14] <plank> what about benefits for the people who clean your office?
[08:30:24] <derpadmin> I beat you to it plank
[08:30:31] <plank> :)
[08:30:48] <kmh__> at least if you believe certain reports, he wasn't even aware hoch some of his companies profits are/were created
[08:30:51] <Samian> I can work anywhere in the world.. All I need is a laptop and mobile service. FB gives me a phone with unlimited internet. I could be in Italy working on a yatch tomorrow, and then in egypt the next day. And then australia the day after
[08:31:14] <plank> you seem to be awfully unwilling to engage in analysis of any class but your own samian
[08:31:37] <kmh__> Samian,  that isn't necessarily a plus
[08:31:41] <Samian> clearly I'm biased. With the pay I get and freedom I get, I am
[08:31:53] <derpadmin> yup
[08:31:56] <plank> admitting youre biased is the first step towards correcting bias :)
[08:32:00] <derpadmin> remove 100k to Samian
[08:32:01] <kmh__> Samian,  in fact this will be part of the current/next big cist saving fashion
[08:32:51] <kmh__> Samian, no/limited office space at work and the company using your private infrastructure for work (home office etc.)

[09:20:26] <Samian> Zuckerberg looks out for his engineers. He has my loyalty.  He didn't need to pay me as much as I get paid. He could have just matched amazon's salaries or google's. He didn't. He did more. Zuckerberg wants his employees to have a thriving life. Bezos just wants himself to have a thriving life.

[09:34:59] <plank> his janitors, i dont think he gives a shit about
[09:35:01] <plank> just like you!
[09:36:00] <plank> how people manage to justify the disparity between their wealth and those of others based solely on their ability to make computers do stuff is beyond me
[09:40:54] <pussipupu> Seems strange to assume that Zuckerberg is interested in the flourishing of facebook's staff at any level
[09:41:39] <plank> im trying to be generous, against my better judgment
[09:41:49] <pussipupu> More parsimonious to assume that it comes down to maximising his power and doing what seems necessary to do that
[09:41:55] <Samian> pussipupu  that's because the media creates a false impression of Zuckerberg
[09:42:01] <amigojapan> Loyalty is a thing even if it can be misplaced, most often is
[09:42:24] <pussipupu> Fair enough, I've only just started my coffee so charity to oligarchs will have to wait a while
[09:42:28] <pussipupu> Samian: What is+
[09:42:37] <Samian> plank  I dont know how much the janitors make, but how much do you propose they get paid?
[09:42:39] <pussipupu> s,+,?,
[09:43:04] <Samian> huh? What do you mean by the plus sign?
[09:43:14] <plank> lets start with comparing their current salary with the CoL for a family of 4
[09:43:29] <plank> that would give us a good idea of a fair living wage
[09:43:39] <pussipupu> It was a typo for a question mark
[09:43:49] <pussipupu> Hence my substitution as my next post
[09:44:18] <Samian> best thing to do is to create a machine to replace janitors so the predicament of a job that doesn't pay a "fair living wage" disappears
[09:44:19] <pussipupu> What is caused by the media's “false” portrayal of Zuckerberg?
[09:44:29] <plank> samian how can you say the media creates a false impression when you dont even know what the situation is like for people working at your own company
[09:44:45] <plank> what on earth are you basing that on
[09:44:48] <Samian> Janitors are contracted out. They don't work for facebook
[09:45:00] <plank> yes, as i alluded to earlier
[09:45:18] <plank> facebook pays a staffing agency to create distance between themselves and the people they employ

[10:47:52] <TechTest> you can buy a house in the nature and enjoy it without actually owning it
[10:48:18] <TechTest> you sure do, but I'd be surprised if you can buy public land for just 100k
[10:48:35] <pussipupu> I'd feed ducks and fish at the beach, swim and sail in and on the lake, forest and enjoy the forest
[10:48:50] <pussipupu> I don't know what you mean by “public land” or why you're assuming it's relevant
[10:49:18] <brigand> yeah, why "own" anything?
[10:49:25] <TechTest> well, a forest or the sea are considered public, everyone can use them
[10:49:49] <TechTest> if you want to buy them, that would make them private, so only you and whoever you choose can use them
[10:51:21] <pussipupu> People could still go in the forest and water, but I coud manage the forets and stop epopel exploting the water
[10:51:55] <TechTest> is it how it works?
[10:52:12] <TechTest> if you buy a beach you don't have the right to permit access to it?
[10:54:30] <arryana> i think if i had an extra 600k, i'd build a complex where people could come and use tools.
[10:54:45] <arryana> woodworking, leather, electronics, pottery, glass, etc

[10:55:08] <pussipupu> I don't know what extra regulations you're assuming
[10:56:30] <pussipupu> Yeah if I had 600k as a one-off I'd get something huge with outbuildings, and set up some proper workshops to probably partly open up as hackerspaces/craft collective areas

[10:58:59] <pussipupu> But if I could have it in the garden that would be extra special, go out whenever the mood strikes
[10:59:01] <arryana> you think it costs $20 a night?
[10:59:09] <plank> theres a sign on the beach that says so
[10:59:10] <plank> so yes
[10:59:14] <arryana> dude, you can't get a campsite closer than petaluma for under $80
[10:59:15] <pussipupu> On like a bouy?
[10:59:23] <plank> yeah, thats what mooring is
[10:59:42] <arryana> they won't let you stay more than a night or two at that price, guaranteed
[10:59:48] <plank> perhaps
[10:59:55] <pussipupu> One also moors to pontoons
[10:59:55] <plank> but then you have a boat and can just leave
[11:00:08] <pussipupu> Or piles
[11:00:23] <arryana> my uncle had a yacht.  keeping boats is pouring money into the water.
[11:00:26] <plank> im not sure what they use to moor the boats in north beach
[11:00:40] <plank> yep, costs a lot to keep em afloat

[11:08:12] <pussipupu> So I'd probably want a bilge keeler or something
[11:08:16] <arryana> yeah, that's shallow
[11:08:36] <arryana> but i don't know what the tides are like there, or if you mean landlocked water
[11:08:43] <pussipupu> Well, it's non-tidal, (strictly it's tidal but the tides here can be ignored)
[11:09:08] * arryana nods
[11:10:32] <pussipupu> It's sea, but Baltic Sea, peak tides are like 3cm
[11:10:52] <pussipupu> So you can just pretend it's always LAT and pretty much get away with it :þ
[11:10:57] <arryana> haha
[11:11:28] * arryana checks the tide on one of her favorite webcams
[11:12:02] <pussipupu> Lakes would be more of an issue for that, because on really hot years they evaporate
[11:12:42] <arryana> ooh, it's in, and coming in more
[11:12:50] <pussipupu> But a 7-9m sloop could be very doable in 1.5m of water
[11:13:09] <arryana> i haven't been on a sailboat in years
[11:13:39] <arryana> not since hawaii, in any meaningful way
[11:13:46] <brigand> pussipupu: where you at? finland?
[11:13:56] <pussipupu> brigand: yeah
[11:14:19] <brigand> interesting thing about the evaporating lakes
[11:15:52] <pussipupu> It's only in really extreme years, but we're going to get more of them
[11:16:08] <pussipupu> And it's only a few cm I guess, but that can make all the difference
[11:16:40] <brigand> ah, right
[11:17:18] <pussipupu> Hah, the house I'm looking at's neighbour has some sort of sailing yacht on their pontoon
[11:17:23] <pussipupu> Or did in 2015
[11:17:41] <brigand> but yeah, i was about to ask if it's a new phenomenon
[11:21:20] <pussipupu> We've had a pretty extreme summer in general this year, been over 30 a lot
[11:22:35] <brigand> yeah, i heard from a norwegian user. meanwhile it's all rainy and comparatively cold in germany
[11:23:39] <pussipupu> Terrible floods down there this year :/

[11:31:11] <pussipupu> I don't honestly think “generations”, especially named ones (and the naming “generations” thing is to my mind dodgy in general) are a hugely useful unit of analysis for this kind of thing
[11:32:38] <brigand> i guess you're right
[11:33:13] <brigand> every generation will use as much as they have available
[11:33:15] <pussipupu> There are tendancies in viewpoint/voting/behaviour that are really there, I just find it's too easy to totalise by generation
[11:33:21] <plank> its highly useful for motivating political sentiment tho
[11:33:45] <plank> if you want young people to vote, convince them that old people are fucking them

[12:02:56] <arryana> i'm always amazed by people who can/will sail alone
[12:03:49] <pussipupu> Especially if I were prepared to drive/bus into the city I might be able to find someone who wants crew but for probably the rest of the season at least not worth the exposure(and I have no leave)

[12:06:11] <arryana> fair.
[12:06:30] <pussipupu> In light air on a small boat, I feel that wearing a vest increases my chances of going overboard(by catching on stays or something) more than in increases my survival if I /do/
[12:06:40] <arryana> also fair.

[22:59:48] <Samian> I just finished watching The Little Mermaid.
[22:59:54] <Samian> Disney movies aren't what they used to be
[23:00:27] <Samian> I like how Disney movies remind me what it means to be human. It's as if the movies are written people who got degrees in Humanities or somethin
[23:00:48] <plank> yikes

[23:05:16] <plank> at least youre honest
[23:05:45] <plank> but yeah, disney. right
[23:06:55] <Samian> all I see is that there's a claim made. I don't know what the exact claim is or wether it's true or not. I could probably dig up the truth, and show it to you, but I'd get fired for posting screenshots of fb internal stuff

[23:11:26] <plank> your complicity, equally so
[23:12:12] <spruit11> oh,  great.  we got someone on the inside now
[23:12:58] <spruit11> Samian: what are your thoughts on the revolutionary potential of Texans vis-a-vis the West Coast?
[23:13:16] <spruit11> just a bit of class awareness could do the trick
[23:13:22] <spruit11> they seem useful to me
[23:16:53] <plank> yeah, you can try teaching class awareness to texans
[23:16:57] <plank> no fucking thanks

[23:39:50] <Samian> In The LIttle Mermaid, the sea witch turns into a giant monster and says "You pitiful insignificant fool". In Aladdin, Jafar turns into a giant monster and says "You little fool"
[23:40:07] <Samian> talk about slapping different characters on the same story
