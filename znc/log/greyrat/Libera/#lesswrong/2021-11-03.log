[00:21:40] <feepbot> <gwern> art app idea: use embeddings to suggest topics for artists by looking for 'holes' in datasets. turn a dataset into its embeddings, and find embedding points which are most equidistant from a lot of real points and are 'holes'. not sure how to do that principledly, but could just spam a lot of random points, do nearest-neighbor lookups, and keep the ones with the highest
[00:21:40] <feepbot> median distance to at least _n_ real points? the idea is to find unrepresented yet highly plausible images to draw, which would then also be useful for training as not redundant and helping interpolate more densely

[03:56:38] <catern> sometimes wikipedia really should be more direct
[03:56:52] <catern> like here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Adams ""Fanny Adams" arrived in 1860s naval slang to describe the new tinned meat which was of dubious provenance."
[03:56:52] <Robomot> Fanny Adams - Wikipedia (Fanny Adams (30 April 1859 – 24 August 1867) was an eight-year-old English girl who was murdered by solicitor's clerk Frederick Baker in Alton, Hampshire, on 24 August 1867. The murder itself was extraordinarily brutal and caused a national outcry in the United Kingdom. …)
[03:57:12] <catern> why not just say "The implication was that the tinned meat was Fanny Adams' dismembered body"
[03:57:47] <catern> not saying it explicitly is almost like making a joke
[03:57:59] <catern> like, is it supposed to be fun for the reader to infer this?
[03:58:29] <nshepperd> was that actually the implication
[03:58:36] <catern> i mean, clearly!
[03:59:10] <rmmh> gwern: stock photography is even cheaper 
[03:59:29] <catern> (i'm saying this because i'm worried about cognitive decline and one day being unable to get the joke. wikipedia should explain jokes so stupid people don't just read it and remain baffled!)
[03:59:43] <nshepperd> i would assume the sailors just thought the meat was dodgy and were making a joke
[04:00:04] <catern> nshepperd: well, yes, duh, but wikipedia has to explain the joke
[04:00:08] <nshepperd> they didn't literally think it was human meat
[04:00:46] <catern> like someone could easily read ""Fanny Adams" arrived in 1860s naval slang to describe the new tinned meat which was of dubious provenance." and then be left baffled: why would it be used to describe tinned meat of dubious provenance? huh? doesn't make any sense
[04:01:20] <catern> i'd say it's unencyclopedic but i'm sure most encyclopedias would be vague rather than explain the crude joke, but wikipedia should be better than that
[04:03:05] *** Quits: spxtr (~spxtr@user/spxtr) (Quit: leaving)
[04:09:19] <nshepperd> 'Some time after the arrest, Cheyney backtracked to Baker's desk in the solicitor's office, and discovered a diary among some legal papers. An entry had been made for Saturday 24 August 1867 which recorded: "Killed a young girl. It was fine and hot".'
[04:11:43] <catern> ah, I take it back, it does say: "In 1869, new rations of tinned mutton were introduced for British seamen. They were unimpressed by it, and suggested it might be the butchered remains of Fanny Adams. "Fanny Adams" became slang for mediocre mutton"

[04:26:40] <rmmh> have you hear of our lord and savior <meta keyword="...">?
[04:27:15] <catern> the huge range in pricing for art commission reminds me of the wide range in programmer salaries
[04:27:17] <mst> rmmh: surely I'd need a screen reader installed for that
[04:28:03] <catern> usually for programmers it's explained away as "programmers can create huge value for different companies" or something, but that seems less true for art... right?
[04:28:11] <catern> is this a general phenomenon in creative work? that substantially similar work has wildly different compensation...
[04:28:54] <rmmh> labor markets are inefficient in many, many ways 
[04:29:49] <gwern> yeah, if you're an artist bad at marketing yourself or setting fees or finding niche, there's no mechanism to fix that if the punishment of 'still being poor' doesn't knock sense into you
[04:29:54] <catern> okay but this one seems especially weird because commissioned art is such a commodity: if someone is offering it for $100 and you can sell it for $500... that's a big opportunity
[04:30:07] <rmmh> some artists charge over $1000 to illustrate a fursona 
[04:30:11] <gwern> it's not like some other better artist can come along and eat you and pop out an additional pair of limbs to do the work you are failing to do
[04:30:39] <catern> gwern: marketing and setting fees and finding niche is all something that an agent could do for you
[04:30:51] <gwern> but then you have literal principal-agent issues
[04:31:01] <gwern> and why think you are any better at principaling when you failed at arting?
[04:31:05] <rmmh> why use an art agency when you could easily undercut them using dumb, poor, starving artists 
[04:31:21] <gwern> although realistically, the 'agent' here is 'a successful company hires you for peanuts, you monkey you'
[04:31:35] <saturn2> just admit it, it's about status
[04:31:46] <catern> the principal-agent issues seem super minor relative to the upside
[04:31:57] <catern> what even principal agent issue do you have in mind?
[04:32:31] <gwern> imagine examples from the music biz and hollywood, involving stuff like copyrights, licenses, and management fees
[04:32:35] <catern> if I'm some artist charging $100 and doing 10 pieces a month, an agent that gives me 10 pieces a month at $200 seems like a win, no matter what else they do
[04:33:03] <gwern> there are some interesting ones from the relatively recent writer's strike where the agents are now putting together entire slates of workers on shows and selling out the writers for higher percentages of the total or something like that
[04:33:10] <catern> eh yeah but this art is basically a service, not actually creating something that has durable value
[04:33:42] <catern> the commissioner presumably gets the copyright, or something
[04:34:12] <catern> but, okay, fair, but still, I find it hard to believe that principal agent problems are the reason for a $100 vs $1000 divide
[04:35:44] <gwern> I think you overestimate how many people actually do any kind of deliberate practice, agentiness, or planning in this sort of thing
[04:36:00] <gwern> hence patio11 blowing programmers' minds by telling them to ask for more money during salary negotiation
[04:36:10] <gwern> or sirlin on scrubs etc
[04:36:11] <catern> they don't have to do any of that
[04:36:26] <catern> they just have to accept an agency's offer of doubled fees when they come around
[04:36:46] <saturn2> people have a limited number of memory slots for status, so there can only be that many artists paid above the baseline within any given niche or subculture
[04:37:43] <mst> power laws

[04:39:45] <saturn2> ... yes
[04:39:53] <catern> at the start of the day you have to memorize who the most good and most evil people are for that day, this is called "watching the news"
[04:40:35] <catern> (I guess people don't watch TV news so "looking briefly at twitter")
[04:40:52] <catern> this allows you to conjure powerful outrage attacks
[04:42:19] <saturn2> "i got my portrait done by the most famous portrait artist in the world!" "wow, cool!" / "i got my portrait done by the 281,903rd most famous portrait artist in the world!" "huh?"
[04:43:32] <catern> saturn2: but these are commercial art commissions I think, I don't think they care too much about status (please? hopefully? or they'll be outcompeted? are you there, EMH? it's me, catern)
[04:43:56] <catern> like for illustrating video games or whatever

[05:14:32] <SDr> saturn2, ok. I _thought_ I had healthcare concierge, but it was the "concierge" itself that referred me to ED; sent them several messages today about asking how to book / set something up to no reply
[05:14:40] <SDr> saturn2, help me here a bit with thinking:

[05:16:06] <nshepperd2> if you had a GP on retainer who only worked for you, you might be considered to have a healthcare concierge
[05:16:10] *** kawpuh1 is now known as kawpuh
[05:16:13] <ggreer> also the robber was out on probation for... robbing? like wtf come on
[05:17:14] <SDr> so, I was referred to the ER, and I went. draw blood, then 3 hours wait. then nurse puts me in a room, and wants to hook me up to IV, and I went what the actual fuck are you doing. I've asked her what the procedure here is going to be; she said CT scan. I've asked that each diagnosis / procedure she's doing to be explicitely called out, she got
[05:17:14] <SDr> offended and left the room; I've pulled out phone to look up prices; and the CT scan price sorta floored me, so I've had a short consult there, then bailed.
[05:17:53] <SDr> I'm really, really uncertain as to, well, to this entire procedure
[05:18:16] <SDr> like, ok, this is a pipeline: people go in on one side; people with $50000k++ healthcare bill come out on the other
[05:18:51] <SDr> I have relatively good relationship with my body, and self-diagnosis said, I'm okay-ish.  Nurse gave me roughly 2 cycle of attention/listening before wanting to hook me up to IV
[05:18:51] <nshepperd2> isn't that what health insurance is for
[05:19:10] <SDr> nshepperd2, my insurance covers ER w/ $250 copay + 30%
[05:19:21] <SDr> 30% of ~x0,000  is lots
[05:19:29] <nshepperd2> i see
[05:19:32] <gwern> 30%?
[05:19:40] <ggreer> https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/san-francisco-residents-sentenced-robbery-and-assault-dangerous-weapon-presidio he was sentenced to 63 months in prison... 61 months ago. so I guess he got out a little early
[05:19:40] <Robomot> San Francisco Residents Sentenced For Robbery And Assault With A Dangerous Weapon In The Presidio | USAO-NDCA | Department of Justice
[05:19:44] <SDr> gwern, 30% out of pocket
[05:20:13] <SDr> so, question: was I wrong with bailing out of ER?   was I wrong with going in the first place?
[05:20:39] <ggreer> oh wait he pled guilty in may of 2016. so he got out in august of 2021 and had 3 years probation after that
[05:20:48] <Betawolf> If they don't want to tell you what they're doing to you and are going to ask you to pay for, leaving sounds sensible.
[05:21:10] <ggreer> SDr: if they bill you, just refuse to pay. I've done that before
[05:21:25] <ggreer> ended up negotiating it down to like 10% of the original bill
[05:21:34] <ggreer> health care prices are made up
[05:21:39] <SDr> ggreer, yes, I will do that, but
[05:21:40] <nshepperd2> hahah
[05:22:17] <SDr> like, from a "you have a medical emergency" perspective, what is then the correct procedure?   like, if _you_ were more sick, would you just go through with ER?
[05:22:25] <saturn2> Betawolf: that's what all doctors do though
[05:22:28] <ggreer> yeah I'd go to the ER
[05:22:54] <mst> can't negotiate the bill down if you're dead, after all
[05:22:55] <Betawolf> saturn2: I guess I dunno how to get actual healthcare in the US. Be rich?
[05:22:57] <nshepperd2> i mean, better to have a whatever health care bill than an exploded appendix
[05:23:01] <SDr> ggreer, so, it's essentially "go to ER, then don't pay?" is that the procedure here?
[05:23:04] <saturn2> SDr: you can leave your id at home and refuse to tell them your name, they still have to treat you
[05:23:06] <ggreer> yeah
[05:23:12] <ggreer> I didn't give them my insurance info though
[05:23:23] <ggreer> so all they had was my name
[05:24:01] <ggreer> insurance might try to collect or do something weird like that
[05:24:32] <saturn2> Betawolf: either be rich or have coverage through your employer
[05:24:33] <ggreer> but absolute worst case, you get a massive bill and refuse to pay. then your credit rating sucks and you can't get a car or house loan
[05:24:40] <SDr> ggreer, but like. do you want to be hooked up to IV, and in limited decision-making capability, under care of people who are relatively certain they will not get paid for you?
[05:24:55] <ggreer> the staff get paid the same no matter what
[05:25:05] <saturn2> the doctors will not care
[05:25:11] <ggreer> they mostly care whether you're not a dick to them
[05:25:51] <mst> the staff want to be medical staff
[05:25:58] <SDr> right, but their decision-making capability can still be bound on level of insurance, no?   like, if there's an expensive operation that they need to make a go/no-go decision on, they _will_ make that on the basis of value of life calculation, for which insurance is first order proxy?
[05:25:59] <mst> it's the billing department who're everybody's enemy
[05:26:04] <ggreer> they don't even know how much the treatments cost. nobody does. the numbers are just made up
[05:26:13] <nshepperd2> SDr: nope
[05:26:36] <saturn2> SDr: they have no idea what anything costs, that's why they get annoyed if you ask
[05:26:44] <ggreer> ER doctors get paid the same whether they help an insured person or an uninsured person
[05:27:44] <SDr> okay, is there any accessibility in terms of speed to medical specialists between ER and "go through appointment scheduling and wait N weeks"?
[05:28:51] <saturn2> the definition of emergency in emergency room is pretty much anything that can't wait N weeks
[05:28:55] <ggreer> someone who collects directly (eg: a dentist, orthodontist, cosmetic surgeon, lasik/prk, or any sort of referral treatment outside of the hospital) probably cares about insurance. when I went partially blind in one eye I just told them I didn't have insurance but that I'd pay cash. it was $400. apparently they'd bill insurance *way* more than that. if anything they preferred cash because it was less paperwork and negotiation
[05:29:13] <mst> there are also places called 'urgent care' that are a midrange between ER and normal doctors
[05:29:38] <ggreer> sorry the ER bill for getting referred to an eye specialist was like $2k. that one I negotiated down to under $200. the vision specialist an hour or two later was $400
[05:30:11] <ggreer> also the solution was to do nothing. it healed on its own over a month
[05:30:57] <ggreer> SDr: I'd recommend going to the ER and getting the problem solved ASAP. worry about money later. you can always refuse to pay if the bill is absurd
[05:31:38] <SDr> mst, I've looked into that, but seems just generic, and no specialists on hand; like, the concierge place I was basically just throw their hands up, and if urgent care doesn't have specialists for it, that's what they'll do as well
[05:31:50] <ggreer> if a doctor sends you to an ER, it's either a liability thing (patient complains of chest pain and probably won't drop dead, but might) or an actual thing that the ER can best deal with
[05:32:13] <mst> SDr: sure, that wasn't my point at all though
[05:33:02] <saturn2> urgent care just means primary care doctors you can see on short notice, if you need a specialist they can't do anything for you
[05:33:35] <saturn2> (except tell you to go to the ER again)
[05:34:06] <SDr> okay, thanks :/
[05:39:06] <gwern> (the embarassing truth of medicine, and why we need randomized control groups for everything, is that pretty damn often, 'the solution was to do nothing')

[13:14:58] <rsaarelm> I got some script glue to convert all the debit card transaction exports from my bank into hledger files, so I get lots of automatic bookkeeping.

[14:25:51] <Gurkenglas> Canon has that the Abyss is many planes, so maybe over time, the unreasonably strongly curved ones become too chaotic for anything interesting to happen, and some weakly hyperbolic planes become hyperbolic enough to converge to demons?

[14:28:07] <Gurkenglas> Then Elysium (chaotic good, expanding hyperbolic) layers would lose curvature and eventually get settled by Nirvana.
[14:28:19] <Gurkenglas> (lose their negative curvature, that is)
[14:31:00] <Gurkenglas> so time strips layers of Heaven and Elysium towards Nirvana, layers of Abaddon towards Hell and Abyss, concentrates Hell's innermost layers into Asmodeus' personal collection (who knows how nested Nessus *really* is?), and unravels the most ravaged regions of the Abyss.
[14:33:07] <Gurkenglas> So if curvature varies over time, a free parameter of the theory seems to be: What causes planes to expand or contract? Is there some geometry-math that describes both expansion/contraction and curvature for me to refer to?

[15:16:06] <Gurkenglas> The difference between Heaven and Axis is that even though on any particular layer, souls tend to be *like* one another, Heaven is the planes where their preferences are also *about* others to the point where you can just put dollar bills on the street instead of in your wallet, and they'll have ~the same effect.
[15:16:56] <Gurkenglas> (And therefore, souls will freely vent excess space into the plane around them.)
[15:20:04] <Gurkenglas> Gods have a home layer *because* they tend to cause souls to have goals precisely like their own, so souls are occasionally sent there.
[15:21:56] <Gurkenglas> Perhaps gods happen when a cluster of souls has a coherent enough set of goals to allow agency. Then the like-with-like sorting system would be just the state of nature, and Pharasma happened because silly mortals thought that anything that powerful must have a god behind it.
[15:23:53] <Gurkenglas> And started declaring that the current afterlife setup is good and worthy of worship. Observing what the world is like and then prefering the world to be that way is a Schelling point precise enough to spawn the most powerful god around.
[15:29:08] <Gurkenglas> In the very beginning, all the clusters were sent to chaotic afterlives, because selecting a point uniformly at random from all planes tends to put you in a plane with exponential amounts of space. Nirvana is the planes with enough like-minded inhabitants around for a long enough time to dilute their curvature a lot. The lawful planes have their inhabitants because they managed to organize enough to *move* 
[15:29:08] <Gurkenglas> everyone there.
[15:30:05] <Gurkenglas> (Which you'd want to do because it makes it easier to find and integrate newly arriving souls.)

[16:13:05] <Gurkenglas> They didn't *really* care about pestilence or famine or the like. But it turns out that if you pick some concept that nobody worships enough to make a god, distinguishing yourself more firmly from other demons, more souls go to whatever plane you're on. The more chaotic Abyss-escapees don't tend to be willing to self-modify like that just to exploit the afterlife setup.
[16:19:01] <Gurkenglas> Devilkind used to be less... ugly, or instinctively drawn towards cruelty, before Asmodeus assimilated those planes for power.

[19:41:44] <feepbot> <gwern> https://blog.waymo.com/2021/11/introducing-waymo-driver-to-new-york.html https://www.therobotreport.com/waymo-begins-mapping-nyc-to-improve-autonomous-driving-tech/
[19:41:45] <feepbot> Waypoint - The official Waymo blog: Introducing the Waymo Driver to New York City’s streets
[19:43:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I was sworn into an intense secrecy agreement (“do not tell anyone, even if they will get hurt if they don’t know”), and told by a friend that I “contained an object” (“object” is basically their confusing term for a psychologically-unhealthy memetic thing). The Ziz/CFAR incident hit the same damn day. I responded by requesting an outside-view sanity-check from Oli**. I told my friend that I’d told someone, as
[19:43:30] <Obormot\Arcturus>  soon as I got back, and shit hit the fan." ... good god
[19:43:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> ("Oli" in this account is Oliver Habryka)
[19:44:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I sometimes call my incident the “quarantine-before-quarantine?” I responded to things like “getting told that I’m not allowed to email partner-of-friend because that gave partner an object” and “friend vents that they can’t visit friend’s-partner, because they caught an object from me, and now they have to wait until someone has an opening for about an hour of bodywork” and “friend says they felt me
[19:44:55] <Obormot\Arcturus>  attack them, while I was just eating breakfast” by generating and following monotonically-increasing explicit rules-of-separation, until we were living in the same house but were not allowed to talk or even be in the same room together. We both moved out a month later. The whole thing is a long story, but basically, friend and I had a gigantic fallout as a result of all of this." ... no, seriously, what the *fuck*
[19:46:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does anyone know what the hell "bodywork" is? (In this context)
[19:47:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I told Oli something to the effect of “Mental illness as social contagion theory; claimed to be spread highly-effectively through circling. Not sure if Ziz incident may be an instance? If there’s another psychotic break within 1 month, boost likelihood of this being true. If there’s not, please update downward on this model.*** Pieces of Leverage’s model of social contagion did not match my own theory of social
[19:47:57] <Obormot\Arcturus>  contagion, and I’m not entirely confident who is in the right, here? Also, this one may have come out of Leverage, but they say it was an accident.”"
[19:48:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> "*** Ziz turned out to be already-crazy as a baseline. There were no psychosis episodes that month from anyone else. I asked around, and I do not believe Ziz had any strong connection to Leverage at all, but especially not in that time-period."
[19:48:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Someone, probably Geoff (it’s apparently the kind of thing he does, confirmed by 2+ people), sent out emails to friends of Leverage framing it as an unwarranted attack and encouraging flooding the comment thread with people’s positive experiences." ... ah, I figured it was something like that
[19:49:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> All those out-of-nowhere commenters arriving to be like "actually Leverage was fine for me, even great!"
[19:50:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "While I realize I’ve kinda de-facto “taken a side” by this point (and probably limited who will talk to me as a result)? I was mispronouncing Geoff’s name, before this hit; this is pretty indicative of how little I knew him personally." ... er, what
[19:50:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Am I super confused or is "Geoff" just pronounced like "Jeff"
[19:50:52] <feep> "geoff", like "cough" /s
[19:51:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Brent’s end-result of “homeless with health-problems in Hawaii”" ... oh no
[19:53:01] <adiabatty> all the Geoffs (n=2) I've known have pronounced their names as "Jeff"
[19:55:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: Your input plz, is "Jeff" the right pronunciation of "Geoff" or is it something more exotic
[19:55:38] <ggreer> that's the correct pronunciation
[19:56:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cool
[19:56:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> How was this person mispronouncing it, I wonder...

[22:25:55] <Robomot> Please stop voting. You’re just making things worse | by David M. Gross | Medium (Voting for president is optional. It's also pointless. It's even harmful. Please stop doing it. There's plenty you could be doing instead.)
[22:26:04] <kuudes> what
[22:26:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "It’s as if your dad promised to take you to a baseball game and instead took you to a junkyard where nine mannequins were stood up against a fence wearing baseball caps. “Well, it’s not an ideal baseball game, I’ll grant you that, but we can’t expect perfection. The perfect is the enemy of the good. Besides, you told me you hate football. Want a bag of styrofoam popcorn?”"
[22:26:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: You heard the man, stop voting
[22:26:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> (in American elections)
[22:26:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Which you shouldn't be doing anyway! Because it's illegal! Down with Finnish influence over American democracy!!)
[22:27:16] <kuudes> you never know if I have a hidden american citizenship in my sleeve :D
[22:28:11] <PapuaHardyNet> american in the streets, finnish in the sheets
[22:28:20] <PapuaHardyNet> oh wait, its the other way round
[22:28:23] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: the problem with this analogy is that any football (american or european) or junkyard would be far more fascinating than an actual baseball game
[22:29:02] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: Well, it's not an ideal analogy, I'll grant you that, but we can't expect perfection...

[22:32:41] <kuudes> XD
[22:34:18] <spxtr> some of my friends found out I didn't vote in one of the elections and got mad at me
[22:34:27] <spxtr> something something civic duty or other
[22:34:36] <spxtr> so I voted in the next one literally to make them happy
[22:37:12] <PapuaHardyNet> did you vote for the candidate they hated?
[22:37:20] <PapuaHardyNet> I hope you did, that would have been hilarious
[22:37:39] <spxtr> no, alas. missed opportunity I know
[22:42:45] <feepbot> <gwern> 'It's like, every step along the way I have to 'remind' myself of what I've already done so I don't forget. So I asked her if stuff like this is easier for her if she can sort of 'put' numbers somewhere to look at them and remember them without requiring constant refreshers. What she told me is that when she does multiplication she can visualize it in her head the same way
[22:42:45] <feepbot> she does it on paper. Meaning the 522 over the 30, then the first line is 60 and the second line has 600 and the third line has 15000. And this just blew my mind. I mean, it makes perfect sense that she would visualize it the same as how she does it on paper but I can't do that and so I've never in my wildest imagination thought about doing math 'in my head' the same way I do it on
[22:42:45] <feepbot> paper. It completely blew me away. I remember struggling so much with math in school because I could do equations in my head but couldn't show my work the way they wanted and I'm thinking this is why.'   'my husband described it similarly to me--he 'sees' a chalkboard in front of him and does the math. I was like, "but how do you remember all the steps along the way??" He said, "I
[22:42:50] <feepbot> don't have to remember, I see them on the imaginary chalkboard".' https://old.reddit.com/r/Aphantasia/comments/qklk5z/my_wife_blew_my_mind_when_discussing_math_the/
[22:42:52] <feepbot> My wife blew my mind when discussing math the other day - curious if other people are similar : Aphantasia (My wife has returned to college and I was helping her with some math problems. I was explaining some mental shortcuts that I do to perform larger...)
[22:45:55] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: yeah, aphantasia is a thing. I wonder how it is to have zero ability to visualize. 
[22:46:44] <PapuaHardyNet> probably like being autistic (which I can very much understand, with my 0 comprehension of social situations)
[22:46:53] <PapuaHardyNet> but for images
[22:47:04] <PapuaHardyNet> visual autism
[22:47:31] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, more LW related to visualization: https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/6nKm7fwfARF3nZWgx/training-regime-day-18-negative-visualization https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/z7b67r7MhshovHLwG/visual-babble-and-prune

It's probably not an original or important problem. But I think there is value in describing the origins of ideas, especially when those ideas are actionable. Here is the problem: I did some analysis on this problem. …)
[22:47:32] <Robomot> Training Regime Day 18: Negative Visualization   - LessWrong 2.0 viewer (There is an old riddle: "The inscription makes you sad when you're happy and happy when you're sad. What does it say?" this too shall pass Someone once told me that stoicism can be summarized as "don't worry about the stuff you can't change." Negative Visualization is a path to becoming more stoic, in the form of 2 TAPs. …)
[22:48:15] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder how much of visualization is visual memory, and how much of it is actual ability to manipulate the visual concepts you have memorized in your head
[22:48:28] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps artists have amazing visualization abilities, but I'm not quite sure
[22:50:35] <linear> I'd say whatever you *specifically* practice is often what you get, but some visusl categories do seem to generalize

[22:51:33] <PapuaHardyNet> morning linear
[22:51:54] <linear> (i view memory as a real time reconstruction of an event, using your *current* visualization skills, less so the ones you had when the memories were formed, gm
[22:52:08] <linear> oh no my close parens)
[22:53:16] <PapuaHardyNet> intrusive flashback memories are always the most vivid hahahah

[22:57:57] <PapuaHardyNet> but yeah, I like the way you define memory. that implies that the more unfamiliar you are with what you are trying to visualize, the harder it will be for you to visualize it

[22:58:19] <PapuaHardyNet> or your brain will substitute familiar equivalents in there subconsciously if you allow it to
[22:58:37] <PapuaHardyNet> very interesting: the babble and prune model does apply to visualization too

[23:04:03] <kuudes> yey, I got a co2 meter and it seems to work
[23:06:48] <linear> they always looked of dubious enough quality to me that i never ended up buying one myself
[23:07:05] <linear> and yeah seems reasonable @ memory

[23:47:03] <two2thehead> kuudes, let me know how it works out

[23:52:04] <two2thehead> kuudes s0ph1a feep , you know those Krestal wind meters SOF snipers use? One guy used that in his house to measure how effective his fans were at ventilation. Mildly interesting
[23:53:43] <feep> mildly amused~
[23:54:38] <spxtr> Anyone gotten their booster shot yet? I'm scheduled to get mine later today.
[23:55:58] <two2thehead> feep, NO! It should interest you. :V
[23:57:00] <two2thehead> But I never considered that you could do a DIY measurement of air movement in a house. I always associated ventilation systems with offices and BSL labs
[23:57:28] <two2thehead> He actually put it on a flat chair, in the middle of the room
