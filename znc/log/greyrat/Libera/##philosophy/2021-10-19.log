[01:45:04] <Player001> Though subjectivity arises from a material ground, thereafter it remains irreducible to this ground
[01:51:52] <causative> Player001, do you propose that this subjectivity can influence how we behave, while being separated from the material ground?
[02:07:03] <causative> or do you propose that the subjectivity has no influence on our behavior at all, so that the brain works fully mechanically, and there is simply this extra "subjectivity" alongside it that does not interact?

[02:24:05] <Player001> it's not separated, just irreducible
[02:25:29] <Player001> and subjectivity influences our behavior but in an indirect way, as shown in Lacan's Schema L
[02:26:22] <causative> so you're saying this subjectivity is not reducible to a material ground, but it *does* have material effects
[02:26:23] <causative> yes?
[02:26:50] <causative> for example, the fact that you are speaking of subjectivity right now, this would count as a material effect that you say is caused by subjectivity?
[02:28:37] <causative> I would say that your speech about subjectivity is caused by your neurons firing. But you are claiming some other cause, other than the neurons, and you claim this other cause is not "material"?
[02:32:50] <Player001> I do not deny that neuron firing is the way in which this typing and sending of signifiers is able to happen
[02:33:29] <causative> so then you say that this irreducible subjectivity completely coincides with the neurons firing?
[02:33:50] *** Quits: NEYi (~NEYi@109.251.216.38) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:34:02] <causative> might we even say it is completely *dependent on* the neurons firing?
[02:35:50] <causative> that this irreducible subjectivity does not happen without the neurons firing, and it doesn't do anything measurably different from what the neurons firing are doing
[02:35:55] <Player001> not really. In this example much of what we are speaking of is in the register of the imaginary
[02:36:49] <causative> then I do not understand your position - either the irreducible subjectivity has effects on the world, or it has no effects separate from the effects of the neurons
[02:36:50] <causative> which is it?
[02:39:06] <Player001> here is a question I have for you: if we were able to completely map out the neurons firing at any given moment and correlate them to beliefs, desires, feelings, etc., would complete self-knowledge be possible?
[02:39:26] <Player001> and do you believe such a process of reading and correlation is theoretically possible?

[02:41:18] <Player001> to the second question: no
[02:41:44] <causative> what do you think would be missing from complete self-knowledge, if we understood everything the neurons are doing and how they correlate to experiences?
[02:42:55] <Player001> to your most recently asked question: we would have knowledge of the subject spoken of (the ego) but the subject (the subject which speaks) could still not know itself.
[02:43:26] <Player001> because of the splitting effect of language elaborated over Lacan's oeuvre
[02:43:45] <causative> what would the subject which speaks not know about itself?

[02:48:04] <causative> is this the "mary the color scientist" argument?

[02:49:19] <causative> why not?
[02:49:21] <Player001> so the subject knowing itself i.e. making statements of the form 'I am X') would be knowing the subject spoken of

[02:52:11] <Player001> to your first question: the subject has the ability to influence the world when no other cause is determining, although I suppose you would say we live in a purely deterministic world so you would agree trivially
[02:53:32] <causative> so you're proposing new physics
[02:53:43] <Player001> not really
[02:53:50] <causative> you're proposing that something can influence the world that isn't atoms or any other subatomic particles
[02:54:03] <causative> and isn't any of the other little things physicists have found
[02:54:27] <causative> you are, aren't you?
[02:54:47] <causative> if you are, I would call that new physics - a new physical influence on the world, very exciting!
[02:55:16] <Player001> I mean Hume already cast doubt on the notion of causality when he was writing in a purely classical world.
[02:55:28] <Player001> classical physics I mean
[02:56:11] <causative> if you're proposing new physics, it must be judged by the standards of any other theory of physics: experiment and empirical observation
[02:57:10] <causative> your proposal would have atoms and electrons and so on moving in ways that our physical, mathematical theories say they *should not move*
[02:58:09] <causative> because our theories of physics say how the atoms and electrons should move, depending on their surroundings, with no gaps - within your brain
[02:58:17] <Player001> I should add that subjectivity arises when its material ground exists in a contradictory state
[02:58:32] <causative> how can a material ground exist in a contradictory state?
[02:58:35] <Player001> causative: that is not even true

[02:59:46] <causative> no explanatory gaps
[02:59:55] <causative> a discrete jump is not an explanatory gap
[03:02:12] <causative> if you are proposing that subjectivity influences the mind via the randomness of quantum physics - well, that's a physical claim, one for which you would need physical evidence
[03:02:39] <causative> if true, it would mean quantum physics is not fully random, but is influenced - and can be predicted - according to some outside influence ("subjectivity")
[03:02:47] <causative> there's no evidence of that
[03:03:16] <Player001> I understand that the mathematics of quantum mechanics is completely random
[03:03:34] <Player001> I mean where a particle ends up in the probability cloud
[03:04:07] <causative> have you heard the phrase "god of the gaps"?
[03:04:18] <Player001> yes
[03:04:37] <causative> it means wherever science lacks a complete explanation - there must be God, or spirits, or other mystical things
[03:04:47] <Player001> subjectivity isn't mystical
[03:04:58] <Player001> it just is
[03:04:58] <causative> and the gaps get smaller and smaller as science keeps explaining more things
[03:05:19] <causative> it's mystical if you are proposing it has an influence on the world that is beyond the mathematical rules of physics

[03:14:18] <causative> I say this: our subjectivity is simply a *perspective* on the material substrate - the same object may appear in different ways depending on what angle you look at it, or what you look at it through, or what tools you use to "look"
[03:14:44] <causative> looking at the brain one way, we see a lump of gray matter.  Looking at it in a different way - from "inside" - we see subjective experience
[03:15:16] <causative> in the same way that looking through a kaleidoscope looks different from looking at the kaleidoscope from outside, or from drawing a diagram of the kaleidoscope

[08:24:20] <sdfgsdfgs> also.. why do you think Jung is "strange" ?
[08:24:47] <sdfgsdfgs> he's more interesting than others, he had a good point
[08:24:59] <sdfgsdfgs> "Jung charged Freud with dogmatism in reducing all mental problems to sexual issues; Freud accused Jung of succumbing to the “black tide” of occultism, or mysticism. After his split with Freud, Jung continued to develop his own distinctive system of analytical psychology, the theories of which he elaborated through the experimental experiences he describes in the Red Book."
[08:25:26] <sdfgsdfgs> and they write each other letters
[08:25:33] <Player001> Freud was right about Jung's occult mysticism
[08:25:53] <sdfgsdfgs> how was he right ?
[08:26:48] <Player001> at the very least, Jung misinterprets dreams
[08:27:34] <sdfgsdfgs> he's very involved and he even uses theological symbols
[08:28:16] <Player001> Jung thinks the truth is to be found in the latent dream thought when the truth is to be found in how the latent dream thought is transformed into the manifest content
[08:28:16] <sdfgsdfgs> you can't just discard his interesting descriptions/interpretations by saying he misinterprets things :)
[08:28:38] <sdfgsdfgs> hmmmm
[08:33:04] <Player001> by truth I mean desire
[08:33:11] <Player001> or the truth of the desire
[08:34:26] <Player001> at any rate it is important because it allows us to see condensation and displacement at work in the unconscious, which shows how the unconscious is structured like a language
[08:37:28] <sdfgsdfgs> so Freud was on a more right path you think ? The man studiest spiritualists' claim of telepathy and other psychic phenomena
[08:37:35] <sdfgsdfgs> studied*
[08:38:33] <sdfgsdfgs> here another quote from him....
[08:38:36] <sdfgsdfgs> "I am not one of those who dismiss a priori the study of so-called occult psychic phenomena as unscientific, discreditable or even as dangerous. If I were at the beginning rather than at the end of a scientific career, as I am today, I might possibly choose just this field of research, in spite of all difficulties."
[08:38:41] <sdfgsdfgs> lol...
[08:39:42] <Player001> the fact is that Freud was able to elaborate a body of work which allowed us to understand the unconscious whereas Jung did not
[08:39:50] <sdfgsdfgs> ung critiqued purely materialist thinking as “intellectual death.”
[08:39:52] <sdfgsdfgs> Jung*
[08:40:03] <Player001> there is a reason Lacan told us to "return to Freud" and not return to Jung

[09:08:49] <sdfgsdfgs> how could I understand him as an ignorant man though ?
[09:11:26] <sdfgsdfgs> his symbols work better for me to identify some things and it could be reduced to that. Your framework for making sense of things is more material

[10:02:50] <causative> we desperately want things: chiefly belonging and social status, or if not that, the illusion of it. And to a lesser extent, we want to create, to be powerful, to understand our condition, to get other forms of pleasure. We have brain modules that propose to help achieve these drives, and these modules gain or lose power depending on how well they seem to be succeeding at that.

[12:02:31] <arryana> oooh, purple is a promising color for a beverage
[12:02:57] <pussipupu> We got a blender so I'm having smoothies
[12:03:02] <arryana> oooh
[12:03:13] <pussipupu> The purple is mostly from blackberry and blueberry
[12:03:15] <arryana> i still haven't unearthed ours since the move.
[12:03:32] <arryana> i should amend that.  i stuck it in a cupboard and haven't messed with it
[12:03:50] <arryana> one of the bonuses of this kitchen is copious storage
[12:04:20] <arryana> today's endeavor is christmas shopping
[12:04:23] * arryana shudders
[12:05:45] <pussipupu> mostly brandy and port surely
[12:06:10] <arryana> that's actually a really good idea
[12:06:27] <arryana> the global shipping nonsense as it is, i thought it might be a good idea not to dawdle
[12:06:49] <pussipupu> on things work suitable shelf life certainly
[12:07:18] <arryana> I've just ordered the dog her christmas present, as they're going out of stock quickly
[12:07:59] <arryana> the zen room is hers, the whole idea of it was to be a dog-friendly semi-outdoor room, and it's her favorite by far.  so i wanted to finish it for her for christmas.
[12:09:24] <assan> pagans
[12:12:21] <pussipupu> We're still not sure where we'll Christmas, though if it's down south we need to book flights soon
[12:14:31] * arryana nods
[12:14:37] <arryana> lemme tellya, airports are a shitshow
[12:14:54] <arryana> people have stayed home so long that they've forgotten how to behave in public.
[12:15:07] <arryana> i do not exaggerate when i say i saw half a dozen full blown tantrums from adults this last trip

[12:16:36] <arryana> i'm just astonished.  apparently there was some altercation in coach, but i didn't see it
[12:17:46] <arryana> i don't know about here, but in the states they're not serving alcohol on most flights, with the exception of first/business class
[12:18:23] <arryana> i can't say it's really helping, it just means people are getting schnockered at the airport bars first.
[12:19:13] <arryana> i'm surprised everyone isn't coming to you, to celebrate the new house
[12:19:49] <pussipupu> They're queuing up for spring it looks like
[12:19:59] <pussipupu> after the Great Freeze
[12:20:31] <pussipupu> And we like to alternate parents for Christmas, plagues and fascism notwithstanding
[12:21:56] <arryana> oooh
[12:22:14] * arryana nods
[12:22:30] <arryana> we did the same when i was a kid, my grandmothers couldn't stand each other.
[12:22:57] <arryana> these days there isn't much of an argument, we usually keep the other half's mom.
[12:23:22] <arryana> his dad feels slighted, but he won't go anywhere without his dog, and his dog attacks all of the pets here.
[12:23:36] <arryana> he won't even agree to confine him to a few rooms of the house.
[12:23:49] * arryana shrugs
[12:24:49] <pussipupu> It is what it is then
[12:24:54] <arryana> yeah
[12:25:08] <arryana> we told him he's welcome if he boards Freddie, or confines him.  i'd even settle for a muzzle.
[12:25:16] <pussipupu> People need to take more moral responsibility for their pets in general to be fair
[12:25:22] <arryana> well
[12:25:29] <arryana> i'm a stern 'pet parent'
[12:25:48] <arryana> he spoils his dog in ways i find appalling
[12:26:21] <arryana> for one, his dog is a jack russell, he should be ten or twelve pounds.  he's 32.
[12:26:43] <arryana> he's so fat he has to sleep with his front paws in front of him and his back ones behind him, on his belly, or he can't breathe
[12:27:03] <arryana> i can't handle that sort of thing, when he hands him a slice of ham the size of the dog's head
[12:27:37] <arryana> i get that he's a lonely old man and he wants to show affection to something.  but there's a level where it stops being a good idea.
[12:29:31] <arryana> in any case, it wouldn't make for much of a christmas.  i admit to being a fan of the quiet, peaceful sort.
[12:30:01] <pussipupu> gotta fly, work beckons
[12:30:03] <pussipupu> Need to go swear at the Danes again :p
[12:30:04] <arryana> with the other half's mom, we spend a bunch of days just eating, drinking, watching the great reindeer herding thing on the bbc
[12:30:08] * arryana waves
