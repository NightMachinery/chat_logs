[10:50:21] <jotham> yeah i was wondering if i get pfizer or AZ
[10:50:25] <jotham> cause i'm due my booster
[10:50:30] <jotham> initial vaccination was pfizer
[10:50:36] <jotham> i am thinking getting the AZ booster
[10:50:44] <jotham> but even the WHO is like, dunno
[10:50:45] <jotham> who knows
[10:51:18] <jotham> our country has been under 100 cases for a couple of days, so it's dying off here again, and reporting 88% fully vaxxed 94% partially vaxxed of 12+ population
[10:51:28] <jotham> no doubt we'll get omicron at some point
[10:52:00] <Renderwww> just don't let anyone or anything onto the island
[10:52:02] <Renderwww> ever again
[10:55:53] <jotham> yep
[10:55:59] <jotham> most of us are okay with that
[10:56:07] <jotham> FORTRESS AOTEAROA HERMIT KINGDOM
[10:56:25] <jotham> country has been so much nicer without tourists shitting and littering everywhere
[10:56:32] <jotham> even if it is 6% of GDP
[11:00:44] <Renderwww> gross derp poop
[11:01:04] <Renderwww> the virus will adapt and infect you over the internet one day, better cut that off too

[11:01:36] <jotham> https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/113055847/shoplifting-tourists-at-epidemic-proportions-in-blenheim-judge-says
[11:01:38] <Renderwww> that makes we wonder, with the distancing and masking and stuff, shouldn't that breed the virus to be long lived flying around
[11:01:39] <jotham> Two tourists repeatedly stole luxury food items such as hummus, kombucha, chia seeds and pate from two Blenheim supermarkets. Their lawyer said they did so out of "desperation" because food is so expensive in New Zealand.  
[11:01:44] <jotham> fuck off aye
[11:01:47] <jotham> honestly
[11:01:51] <jotham> we can't afford those foods
[11:01:56] <jotham> hipster tourism is gross

[11:02:40] <Renderwww> kek "particularly from France"
[11:02:47] <jotham> yeah we already hate the french here
[11:02:51] <jotham> so it's an easy sell
[11:02:57] <jotham> the french can fuck off
[11:03:27] <jotham> nz's founding involved the british taking a dozen maori chiefs around the pacific and showing them french colonies
[11:03:33] <jotham> and the queen saying she'd protect them from the french
[11:03:35] <jotham> haha
[11:03:36] <Renderwww> "French national Heden Raffen, 21, and British national Jemma Lorraine Cammish, 25, appeared in the Nelson District Court" just don't let people with strange names in
[11:03:47] <jotham> agreed
[11:04:04] <jotham> it's bad cause 1/3 of the uk is french / norman
[11:04:11] <jotham> so you don't even know who is french in their bones
[11:04:26] <jotham> maybe dna test to visit nz
[11:05:04] <Renderwww> or maybe add an age restriction, only 30+ boomers are allowed in
[11:05:14] <jotham> i've worked for ubisoft france twice
[11:05:21] <jotham> it wouldn't take much work for the french not to be shitheads
[11:05:25] <jotham> but they absolutely cannot
[11:05:54] <Renderwww> dunno, I just don't like them for their language

[11:06:22] <jotham> i can see why belgians are between a rock and a hard place
[11:06:29] <jotham> are they swamp germans or french people
[11:06:32] <jotham> tough deal for T`aZ 
[11:09:40] <Renderwww> as some wise man on TV once said, it's wrong to be french
[11:11:09] <Renderwww> https://i.imgur.com/DSjyRZM.png it's even rule 2, shows how important it is
[11:12:26] <Renderwww> though they did some good too, like that arcane show
[11:14:18] <Renderwww> that construction site across the street will never be silent. I thought they finished all the noisy construction things but now they have some kind of forklift forklifting things around for hours and every time it drives backwards it makes beepy noises
[11:14:43] <Renderwww> how can this be legal?

[11:49:51] <T`aZ> between idiots and naziq, yes
[11:49:55] <T`aZ> nazis*
[11:49:58] <T`aZ> it's a perfect mix
[11:50:17] <T`aZ> smartness of one side, pragmatism/not carig of the other
[11:52:03] <Carbonflux> its the same here, noise regulations sucks.
[11:52:30] <Carbonflux> if you complain they will tell you its for safety reasons.
[11:52:54] <Carbonflux> but the people that make these regulations often don't live near construction.
[11:53:20] <Renderwww> they should sacrifice one or two people a year getting run over by backwards driving machinery for the greater good of the many having their piece of mind!
[11:53:45] <Carbonflux> heh
[11:53:48] <Renderwww> simple utilitarian calculation
[11:55:48] <Carbonflux> well, you find that most city council members either don't really live in the city or in areas where construction is not an issue, so they make an economic calculation...
[11:55:59] <Carbonflux> for example, we live near a big freeway
[11:56:12] <Carbonflux> they tend to schedule work at night
[11:56:48] <Carbonflux> so many times in the middle of the night they are doing really noisy work
[11:57:13] <Carbonflux> if you raise the issue they claim its because if they do it during the day it interferes with the commute.
[11:57:33] <Carbonflux> cities are weird that way
[12:09:08] <Faux> Looks like, on my new AMD card, on Linux, if it goes into powersave, X crashes pretty hard.
[12:09:29] <Faux> Which is quite high up the Not Great list tbh.
[12:15:00] <T`aZ> amd, not even once
[12:17:15] <Faux> In fact it looks like the card is no longer talking pcie.
[12:17:21] <Faux> I think it might be RMA time.
[12:20:13] <Renderwww> lel, he fell for the AMD on linux meme!
[12:20:34] <Renderwww> simple fix would be to have some crypto miner running all the time to prevent powersave mode!
[12:23:51] <Faux> https://pastebin.com/eSszR50w o
[12:24:32] <Renderwww> maybe 6 month old drivers weren't such a good idea after all
[12:24:45] <Faux> It's only two months old!
