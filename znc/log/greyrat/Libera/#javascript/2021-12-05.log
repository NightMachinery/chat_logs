[01:58:42] <DPA> In the past, things like prompt even used to prevent reflows & such stuff. Browsers have relaxed that since. Still, what is effectively rendered shouldn't change as long as any JS functions are running.
[01:59:42] <silly> https://jsfiddle.net/tw7uL45e/
[02:00:22] <silly> it really seems to be waiting with the draw until the function is finished
[02:02:35] <DPA> I think the behavior with prompt() in firefox is a bug.
[02:03:38] <DPA> But there is no way it's going to be fixed. It'd be way to tedious to have to keep the changes around to apply later.
[02:04:36] <DPA> And the reason reflows now are allowed while prompt is running is because it used to be a bad user when it didn't.
[02:04:47] <DPA> *user experience
[02:05:18] <silly> you think this behaviour is defined in specs?
[02:05:51] <DPA> I haven't really read those parts, but I would expect it to be.

[02:10:27] <d3x0r> so it's obviously not specified... but prompt should dispatch events too - even though it's not technically off the JS execution stack - but maybe that causes reentrancy issues - only some events canwork

[02:12:26] <hassoon> d3x0r: what button anyway
[02:12:28] <silly> both, chrome and firefox apply the style after a delay
[02:12:30] <d3x0r> *shrug* I don't really like modal dialgs anyway so I have a popups module with alert/prompt/etc simple function that make popup like things out of divs :)
[02:12:31] <hassoon> are you referring to a fiddle ?
[02:12:38] <silly> that's rather unexpected imo
[02:12:45] <d3x0r> well they generaly all have a button to click and a color change in various ways
[02:12:53] <d3x0r> I like the await one ;) but that's not the same as prompt at all

[04:53:35] <ThePendulum> % is the modulo operator, it gives you the remainder of a division. so 3 % 5 remains 3, 5 % 5 remains 0, so if you increment i every iteration with a modulo of 5, it'll effectively keep resetting to 0 at 4
[04:54:56] <ThePendulum> or after 4 rather, when it hits 5 you get 0 again
[04:55:42] <theskillwithin> chazy maybe something like this https://jsfiddle.net/theskillwithin/hLta7m24/
[04:55:43] <chazy> what's "// use i;" ?
[04:55:58] <ThePendulum> I suppose it would be cleaner to do function tick(value = 0) { console.log(value); setTImeout(() => tick((i + 1) % 5)); }
[04:56:09] <ThePendulum> that's a placeholder for whatever you want to do with i
[04:56:14] <ThePendulum> I assume you are ticking it for some sort of purpose
[04:57:32] <chazy> oh ok, my bad, i meant i'm already inside a setInterval() and i need to get this sequence of 0 through 4 each tick of the setInterval
[04:58:21] <ThePendulum> !setinterval
[04:58:22] <jellobot> ThePendulum, Avoid setInterval; use setTimeout instead. https://web.archive.org/web/20160602165800/https://zetafleet.com/blog/2010/04/why-i-consider-setinterval-to-be-harmful.html (requestAnimationFrame may be another alternative, see !raf)
[04:58:45] <ThePendulum> in this case setTimeout also allows you to increment the value in the argument

[04:59:54] <systemfault> theskillwithin: Hehe https://jsfiddle.net/qxbadLj4/
[05:00:48] <chazy> although, to prevent an xy problem: in this interval (will change to setTimeout()), every 6 minutes i'm changing the color of an element from red to green (red in css, green through js) but every second of the interval i'd like to keep changing from red to green and green to red (until every 6 minutes when i add the id of the element to an array so i skip changing it again)
[05:01:20] <ThePendulum> wouldn't a css animation be more suitable?
[05:01:47] <chazy> i can't, the interval is for a countdown timer using a date from the server
[05:02:09] <chazy> https://gist.github.com/ChazyTheBest/b22036b684929ef79f9205d09c7cf504
[05:02:28] <ThePendulum> here's skill's function adapted to my suggestion, for reference https://jsfiddle.net/ThePendulum/qykbn9xs/
[05:03:17] <ThePendulum> if it's just swapping red and green, why does the date matter?
[05:03:35] <chazy> because the countdown is based on the date
[05:03:38] <chazy> from the server
[05:04:01] <ThePendulum> but the color swap just signals the ticking every second?
[05:04:25] <ThePendulum> how does the interval take the date into account?
[05:04:47] <chazy> it's a 6 hours countdown for a game, every hour an icon's color changes from red to green, but in the meantime every 6 minutes each path of the svg element changes, and every second keeps changing
[05:05:27] <ThePendulum> ah you need the second digits and the colors to be in sync?
[05:06:33] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@c-65-96-171-157.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[05:06:46] <chazy> yes, while in an hour countdown, the corresponding svg (the paths) keep changing from red to green and green to red, but every 6 minutes one of the paths stays green

[05:09:48] <chazy> until the hour has passed and the whole svg stays green and doesn't change to red anymore, then the next svg starts doing the same

[05:11:42] *** Joins: reallymemorable (~reallymem@70.107.110.8)
[05:11:51] <chazy> in the else, instead of a random number, i want sequential 0-4 so it's consistent const id = Math.floor(Math.random() * (4 - 0 + 1) + 0);
[05:14:16] <chazy> i also have to account when the id is 0 i can't just do id-1, the path # 9 has to change to red only if it's not in the skip array

[09:06:51] <ljharb> regular html isn't in jsx

[11:19:53] <Maxdamantus> Are you trying to protect the carpet or the chair?
[11:20:03] <Maxdamantus> I use carpet to protect my chair from concrete.
[11:21:27] <theskillwithin> trying to protect the carpet
[11:22:17] <theskillwithin> if i had my chair just on raw carpet, it would tear it up pretty fast
[11:22:25] <Maxdamantus> Maybe just get another carpet to put on top of the carpet? If the carpet that's there is valuable enough to need protecting.
[11:23:10] <Maxdamantus> Chair on carpet seems pretty normal to me.
[11:23:40] <theskillwithin> well offices have short carpet,  but apartments and homes have medium carpet
[11:23:46] <Maxdamantus> Maybe it depends on the castor wheels. I've never used the wheels with rubber on them, and I can imagine they might be unsuitable for carpet.
[11:24:46] <theskillwithin> my wheels dont have rubber on them
[11:26:20] <theskillwithin> Maxdamantus some people like replacing their chair wheels with https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G643EU6/
[11:26:39] <Maxdamantus> Anyway, pretty sure carpet is the standard surface for office chairs, so I'd just try getting some non-fixed carpet I guess.
[11:26:59] <theskillwithin> i work from home
[11:27:38] <theskillwithin> the normal length carpet, with an office chair,  you will tear up the carpet
[11:27:57] <theskillwithin> carpet in an actual office is very short, so doesn't have that problem
[11:32:00] <theskillwithin> Maxdamantus but I like how you think.  instead of using this bs plastic protector,  just buy a rectangle piece of carpet.  and use that as my mat

[15:19:12] <ashnur> don't assume I didn't know, rather, question why i thought it was important to say it despite the circumstance

[15:23:15] <zak_> I was just responding to the statement about him never reflecting on things
[15:23:25] <ashnur> zak_, i would say, most of what people think is rational, is not rational at all

[15:25:02] <ashnur> without knowing the context, I rather not even think about the situation
[15:25:36] <zak_> It's just important to think about the people you know. Take a moment to ask people if they're okay, even if they seem alright.
[15:25:58] <zak_> Sometimes, just a moment or thought can make all the difference
[15:26:44] <ashnur> i tend to take the most vague meaning that is still self consistent, rational would be generally speaking, something that someone thinks is well reasoned, thought about and not done thoughtlessly
[15:26:47] <gde33> my take would be that one should be able to imagine switching places with others in situations. If you enjoy helping people you should know it is the same for others, specially those you've helped.
[15:27:12] <gde33> Its not all of a sudden bothering people if the roles are reversed.
[15:28:39] <ashnur> zak_, what about the people who are not known personally by many because they tend to only go out for shopping and otherwise live on the internet?

[15:36:22] <zak_> I think that's what makes us human. We fight even if the odds are bad.
[15:36:27] <zak_> It's probably the best way we're irrational

[16:19:32] <zak_> silly: no, that's bad
[16:19:43] <zak_> big projects are the worst offenders
[16:20:12] <zak_> experienced developers do not want to spend their time compiling the entire project

[17:04:28] <zak_> automating, virtualizing and hosting your dev environment in the cloud
[17:05:13] <zak_> it's also amazing for big companies, because normally, you have teams working on specific parts of code

[17:10:36] <zak_> it's just more about norms in a company too
[17:11:10] <zak_> eg. If you don't have a CI or tests, then perhaps your team has a culture of doing manual tests

[17:12:22] <zak_> The same way in that most dev environments aren't automated, so teams have documentation on how to set them up manually
[17:12:31] <zak_> or worse, it's just tribal knowledge

[18:55:47] <xall> I'm trying to set alerts based on text on a page. There's a button on the page that fetches new data, updating a table. I have an infinite setTimeout that clicks the button and then queries the DOM. The issue I have is that it seems like sometimes the DOM query happens before the DOM is updated, because sometimes the result is stale.
[18:56:40] <xall> It seems like something analogous to sleep needs to happen
[18:56:50] <xall> I tried `(async () => await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2 * 1000)))()`
[18:57:12] <qswz> that does nothing
[18:57:21] <xall> ok
[18:57:33] <qswz> !delay
[18:57:34] <jellobot> qswz, JavaScript in the browser doesn't have a sleep command -- as it's single threaded (if that makes no sense, ask). Instead, use the setTimeout function. Example: `do_this(); window.setTimeout(do_this_in_after_at_least_2seconds, 2e3);`
[18:57:34] <xall> I figured it's my lack of js knowledge

[20:10:29] <trafficjam> does the parent intercept that somehow and then set the width of the iframe to this value?
[20:10:30] <gde33> js in the parrent window can just read its own location.hash ofc
[20:10:59] <gde33> but its a bit of a hack
[20:11:19] <gde33> more sane is to use CORS or just make the widget fixed height
