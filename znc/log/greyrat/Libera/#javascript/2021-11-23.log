[00:00:35] <systemfault> Deneb: The TL;DR is... JavaScript is a trademarked name by Oracle so the language was standardized using the name ECMAScript
[00:02:00] <systemfault> ESM is an acronym for ECMAScript Module
[00:02:18] <systemfault> It's only about loading importing/exporting things...
[00:02:53] <systemfault> The syntax was defined in 2015 but it took another committee roughly 5 years to figure out how it would work internally for NodeJS and the Browser.
[00:03:04] <earendel> i think you can justify esm for people who want to develop using browser dev tools, and want some aspects of modularity without using closures.  but really only then.
[00:03:36] <Deneb> so really, there is no JavaScript anymore in the sense of the original Oracle developped language. So what do people mean when they refer to 'pure JavaScript'?

[00:04:17] <hax> oracle??
[00:04:24] <systemfault> Oracle never developed JS, it just got the trademark when they bought Sun
[00:04:42] <stenno> list.map(...).take(n) is the same as list.take(n).map(...) with async iterator helpers
[00:04:46] <Deneb> sorry, my bad, originally developped by Mozilla I think...
[00:04:54] <systemfault> And the language itself was created by NetScape... (Brendan Eich)
[00:05:19] <Deneb> ah, yes, prior to Mozilla.
[00:06:20] <Deneb> so really, it seems like there is not such thing as 'pure JavaScript'. It has been developped over time by different entities with features being added over time?
[00:06:22] <systemfault> The short and more or less true story is... NetScape creates JS, MS creates their own dialect... MS is slowly killing NetScape, NetScape pushes the standardisation of JS under the name ECMAScript...
[00:06:24] <hax> i think this is conflating ecmascript and javascript

[00:07:46] <Deneb> well, erm, yes, over MS have always created their own incompatible version of what had been accepted as standard by everyone else...
[00:07:55] <systemfault> ECMAScript 5 has a few small changes over ES3... (Array iteration methods) but nothing spectacular... ES6 (ES2015 changed everything)
[00:09:14] <Deneb> systemfault: sounds like it makes sense to write to ES6 standards then and as you say, use babel to convert backwards for older browsers like IE....

[02:34:46] <lantech19446> what does the textcontent method do? Is that like pintln in java?
[02:37:50] <pavonia> It's not a method, it's a property of DOM nodes which yields the text representation of the node
[02:38:36] <hax> all of it though, even hidden ones

[02:39:59] <lantech19446> hmm ok. So if I want to spit something out on the screen instead of using alert how do I do that? I tried print but apparently that quite literally sends something to be printed
[02:40:59] <hax> you create then add the node
[02:41:58] <hax> or get an element and set its innerHTML
[02:42:06] <lantech19446> I'm not quite that far along yet is a node like a variable?
[02:42:45] <pavonia> Setting innerHTMl would get you into escaping trouble, probably better to set textContent instead
[02:43:49] <lantech19446> but I'd define an empty variable say called result and then do result.textcontent("my text here") ?

[02:45:44] <pavonia> DOM nodes are a HTML concept. You can access and manipulate them from JS, but it's something very different from JS variables
[02:46:09] <hax> use a document method to get a node, either set new content or create a new node and append it. the language doesn't have anything to do with the browser's document model. think of it as a library that's always imported

[07:43:40] <theskillwithin> Intelo idk but I'm curious whats stored procedures?
[07:44:28] <ljharb> functions that live in the database
[07:44:35] <ljharb> Intelo: ok so, those things are unrelated
[07:44:48] <ljharb> Intelo: using an ORM or just a query builder is entirely unrelated to whether you use stored procedures or not
[07:45:15] <ljharb> Intelo: you should use them, or not use them, just the same whether you're hand-typing queries or whether you're going full-blown ORM (of course, both ends of that spectrum are terrible)

[07:46:26] <theskillwithin> i just use objection, but im not backend
[07:46:28] <ljharb> stored procedures are generally rarely used, and you'd only really want to use one for a hugely security-critical task
[07:46:39] <ljharb> (objection is a query builder, i believe)

[07:51:35] <Rockwood> mostly .NET devs like stored procedures
[07:51:42] <Intelo> ljharb I am double minded. I want a) re-usability just like knex in node or an orm b) dev team isolation. Team A should not see or have any access to the work and queries of team B.  They can just call each other's functions. They should not even see each others code. c) no one should be able to do select * from myCreditCard table. but for c) I was
[07:51:43] <Intelo> thinking to never give them production dump. or replace /scramble things before giving.  So c) won't be a problem. Unless you have some thing else to say
[07:53:14] <Intelo> I don't think I would use ORMs.
[07:53:18] <Intelo> either Knex or STs
[07:53:20] <ljharb> Intelo: ORMs don't provide reusability
[07:53:38] <ljharb> Intelo: because nobody in the history of ORMs has ever migrated their database backend without making significant changes to their queries
[07:53:41] <Intelo> that's one of the reasons I don't plan to use ORms
[07:53:53] <ljharb> Intelo: but also, what? why would team A and team B not be able to see each other's code
[07:53:57] <ljharb> that sounds terrible
[07:54:06] <ljharb> everyone should be able to see and modify everyone else's code, modulo code owners/code review
[07:54:17] <theskillwithin> ya thats what i focused on
[07:54:36] <theskillwithin> i figured i musta misread
[07:54:38] <Intelo> ljharb well isolation of business logic, micro service architecture, security issues (trusting devs is ok but lets consider a banking app. No one would take the risk)
[07:54:46] <ljharb> Intelo: yes, they would and do
[07:54:47] <Intelo> ie if its avoidable, it should be avoided
[07:55:02] <Intelo> ljharb correction: "they would do as far as it is needed and not any further"
[07:55:08] <ljharb> Intelo: yes, and the most avoidable thing is bugs caused by one team not being able to look themselves and see how another team's code works
[07:55:26] <ljharb> Intelo: limiting who can approve changes is wise, obviously. limiting who can see code and propose changes is not.
[07:55:46] <Rockwood> bye cya

[07:56:44] <Intelo> I agree with you ljharb you have a point but all cannot be in one thing. e.g backend exposes an api. frontend knows the req/resp model. If anything breaks, Frontend guys has no business with fixing it with backend. They just report that req/resp has errors.
[07:57:03] <Intelo> ljharb same example with an app having 5 parts. 5 servers. ie micro services
[07:57:15] <Intelo> they communicate via api/ sockets/ redis etc
[07:57:21] <Intelo> pub /sub whatever
[07:57:33] * Intelo is talking about a big app

[07:58:11] <ljharb> Intelo: but even in MASSIVE apps, typically every dev, even a new hire straight out of college, can see and propose changes to *every single line of code in the company*
[07:58:12] <Intelo> ljharb   they are not authoraized to approve / disapprove. the architect decides it
[07:58:21] <ljharb> there are small exceptions, usually around security team code, and PCI-compliant code
[07:58:29] *** Joins: gggp (~gggp@li1776-19.members.linode.com)
[07:58:37] <ljharb> Intelo: sure but they can see the code and make a PR
[07:58:54] <ljharb> a company that doesn't even let a backend dev *see* the frontend code, or the reverse, is not a good company
[07:58:59] <Intelo> ljharb pci compliant? now you are talking
[07:58:59] <systemfault> ^
[07:59:24] <ljharb> Intelo: the vast majority of code even at companies like Stripe - all of which is PCI compliant - is visible to *every single engineer*
[07:59:44] <ljharb> and it would be absurd if that weren't the case
[07:59:50] <Intelo> ljharb ... "they" will only see the "repo" and code to which they have access.  not the other part.   The other part will be seen and maintained by another team. Each part will communicate via apis/ sockets
[08:00:04] <Intelo> just like FE /frontend  dont need to see code of BK / backend
[08:00:25] <theskillwithin> Intelo im FE, so I can't see your backend code if you hired me?

[08:00:30] <Intelo> they both have no business else than agreeing on a req/resp model of RESTful api]
[08:00:37] <systemfault> Maybe your company should stop treating your devs like dogs.... and more like programmers...
[08:00:45] <ljharb> Intelo: i'm saying that your company is incompetent if EVERY engineer does not have access to EVERY line of code, with very few exceptions
[08:01:03] <ljharb> Intelo: i was a frontend engineer at twitter, and i could see every bit of code any engineer wrote at any time
[08:01:10] <ljharb> Intelo: same at airbnb. and same at coinbase.
[08:01:26] <ljharb> Intelo: and a bunch of other less name-droppy companies
[08:01:30] <theskillwithin> every large corp i worked at, i can see every repo all the code
[08:01:31] <Intelo> ljharb there is one important point here. A starting point.  All devs should not see All code. Its the primary policy of the company for 'this' particular app for security and patent reasons
[08:01:34] <neshpion> i'm in ur codes, seein ur bugs

[08:04:04] <Intelo> ljharb I see
[08:04:24] <Intelo> ljharb i wonder why the heck the local banks do all things in STs
[08:04:40] <Intelo> and limit devs not to see the ST code. only call them
[08:04:49] <Intelo> ljharb surely you do have a point but I am confused
[08:05:44] <ljharb> because banks are archaic and stupid and paranoid, probably
[08:05:59] <ljharb> there's nothing about the way banks do things that's something to strive for, whether that's in code or in finance
[08:06:27] <theskillwithin> hospitals can be quit terrible as well
[08:06:38] <Intelo> so I wonder why banks choose this? and in what cases STs fit best?

[08:29:02] <Intelo> ljharb so SPs don't have a real uscase in 2021?

[08:30:00] <ljharb> Intelo: it's not about 2021, it's always been the same

[08:32:37] <ljharb> Intelo: i don't see why it'd be any different in another country
[08:32:46] <Intelo> in asia, its better to not allow someone to spoil you rather than relying on a contract / law to enforce damages "after" someone has spoiled you

[08:33:07] <ljharb> Intelo: i don't see how that applies
[08:33:25] <ljharb> Intelo: you're "being spoiled" by letting fewer people see code, which means you have more bugs

[08:43:27] <Intelo> ljharb even fb is a US based company and US has no jurisdiction in india/ china ?
[08:43:29] <ljharb> and unless a critical mass of them move, it's not enough to be worth it
[08:43:35] <Intelo> they can put people there in jail?
[08:43:38] <ljharb> Intelo: fb has an india corporation and a china one
[08:43:45] <ljharb> Intelo: both of which can and do work with the government
[08:43:48] <ljharb> Intelo: so yes, yes they can
[08:44:02] <ljharb> Intelo: because india desperately needs facebook's money and goodwill
[08:44:11] <ljharb> Intelo: and china desperately needs to be able to spy on its people
[08:44:49] <ljharb> Intelo: there's not really any "jurisdictions" anymore, if a government needs what a company brings, the company has influence over the government. any government.
[08:44:53] <Intelo> amazing

[08:45:13] <Intelo> half a dozen corporations ruling the world
[08:45:14] <theskillwithin> and the obvious thing is stealing users data like that would be a huge concern for any government trying to protect their people
[08:45:41] <neshpion> well before, it was half a dozen countries ruling the world
[08:45:47] <ljharb> Intelo: far more than that. but yes, that's capitalism.
[08:45:49] <neshpion> now you have corpos instead
[08:46:10] <ljharb> theskillwithin: or those that want to spy on theirs. which is a growing number.
[08:47:55] <Intelo> I wonder if those corps joined and formed a govermnent/ country/ something like UN
[08:49:54] <Intelo> anyway, drifting back to JS world. ljharb what would you think a good MS (microservice) architecture would be to use where apps communicate with each other via a) TCP sockets b) websockets c) redis messaging or pub/sub or kafka etc d) http api calls (practical but slow performance) e) anything else?
[08:50:18] <ljharb> there's no single answer for that
[08:50:27] <ljharb> it depends on a ton of things that we won't be able to lay out here
[08:50:38] <Intelo> ljharb ya people do it in all such different ways but where do you lean more towards?
[08:50:49] <theskillwithin> theres a dichotomy here,  give government more power to regulate,  but now you've given large corps more ways to influence government to lobby that power
[08:51:19] <ljharb> theskillwithin: and give them less power, and now the corp has more ways to influence people without regulation
[08:51:27] <Intelo> generally speaking. d) is slowest and easiest  and a) is fastest and difficult as all protocol have to be written by me
[08:51:33] <ljharb> guess the common thread
[08:51:39] <earendel> can i chose more than one answer?
[08:51:42] <earendel> lol
[08:51:48] <ljharb> it starts with capital and ends with ism
[08:52:12] <earendel> e is definitely true. or will be.
[08:52:21] <ljharb> just the inherent tradeoffs of our economic system ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:52:28] <earendel> unless sudden vacuum decay.

[13:17:31] <joepie91> there is absolutely nothing in the GDPR that requires "annoying popups" (that is an intentional choice from asshole-y marketing people to plausibly-deniably frustrate you into giving fake 'consent'), there are a ton of sliding-scale mechanisms in it to make sure that small organizations do not have an unreasonable burden to deal with, and all compliance is evaluated in the context of what could reasonably be expected from an organization

[13:22:20] * joepie91 sighs
[13:22:58] <joepie91> you know the thing where you should recognize when you're out of your depth on a topic, and not come up with inane 'clever' takes to try and cover for it? yeah, that
[13:23:21] <joepie91> you could take this as an opportunity to learn something new about the GDPR
[13:23:32] <joepie91> if you're not interested in that, 🤷, I can't help you
[13:23:48] <hax> it can cost you a lot of money if you're trying to do business with EU citizens and you don't comply
[13:23:52] <joepie91> unlike a corporate lawyer, I don't charge a couple hundred bucks an hour
[13:24:05] <joepie91> so I can assure you that I'm a lot cheaper to learn this from
[13:25:26] <theskillwithin> getting legal advice on the internet sounds legit
[13:27:08] <joepie91> chovy: anyway, bottom line, if the popups annoy you and you're residing in the EU (that's unfortunately a requirement for this to work), file a complaint with your local data protection authority, because said popups are basically always violating the GDPR (dark patterns are explicitly not permitted) and a lot of DPAs need to internally justify their enforcement priorities by showing complaint metrics
[13:28:01] <theskillwithin> so basically report every website
[13:28:26] <joepie91> technically you can have a popup that doesn't violate the GDPR, if it's unambiguously clear about the collection and presents the accept/reject options on exactly equal footing - but realistically, the kind of person who would do it that neatly would also recognize that popups are a bad idea and solve the consent thing differently, so de facto every popup is gonna be violating the GDPR
[13:28:48] <joepie91> certainly every single major "compliance-as-a-service" popup violates the GDPR
[13:28:51] <theskillwithin> joepie91 its not up to us, its up to legal department

[13:31:11] <hax> joepie91, why do CaaS violate GDPR?
[13:31:29] <hax> do they take ad money too?
[13:34:54] <joepie91> hax: because all those popups are designed to be coercive, essentially manipulate the user into 'consenting' to 'make it go away' - by hiding some toggles (like the "legitimate interest objection" bullshit that a couple have started to do recently), or visually highlighting the 'accept' button and de-emphasizing the 'reject' button, or hiding the 'reject all' option behind several screens while putting 'accept all' in full view, or by "forgetting"
[13:34:55] <joepie91> the rejection choice every couple days, etc.
[13:35:13] <joepie91> hell, many of them don't even block the tracking scripts on the first load at all
[13:35:19] <joepie91> all of that violates the GDPR
[13:35:20] <theskillwithin> joepie91 even if the popups aren't intended... they still happen.  so its still a failure
[13:36:18] <joepie91> hax: basically, those 'hosted consent dialog' things were never built to actually implement the safeguards in the GDPR; they were built to have something to sell to companies which want the fastest possible way to pretending the GDPR doesn't exist

[13:41:35] <joepie91> anyway, when the fines for those popups start dropping, it'll probably start in NL
[13:41:46] <joepie91> the Dutch DPA has already fired a shot across the bow about them
[13:42:08] <joepie91> basically the "don't make us tell you this through a fine"
[13:42:13] <theskillwithin> poor people hit first
[13:42:27] <sheetjs> fines are essentially baked into the business models
[13:46:14] <joepie91> sheetjs: that's actually the reason why the GDPR has the fine structure it does!
[13:46:38] <joepie91> it's, from memory, a fine of max 2 million EUR or 4% of global revenue, whichever is higher
[13:46:57] <joepie91> the percentage is to deal with companies which try to bake this into their business model, to make it very difficult to make the numbers work out for privacy violations
[13:46:59] <sheetjs> there was a recent facebook shareholder complaint on this topic
[13:47:02] <theskillwithin> see what happens when you fine a shit ton of unaware small businesses over a cookie,  haha its not gunna happen
[13:47:08] <joepie91> the fixed maximum is to deal with clever accounting schemes where companies claim to have zero revenue
[13:47:18] <sheetjs> "Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and other Facebook directors agreed to authorize a multi-billion settlement with the FTC as an express quid pro quo to protect Zuckerberg from being named in the FTC’s complaint, made subject to personal liability, or even required to sit for a deposition"
[13:47:35] <joepie91> it's honestly all quite well-designed, we're just super lacking in enforcement capacity right now for dumb political reasons
[13:47:42] <joepie91> sheetjs: yeah
[13:47:52] <joepie91> that's really common for fixed-maximum fines
[13:47:57] <theskillwithin> facebook, google, etc suffer the least here
[13:48:01] <sheetjs> supposedly this "multi-billion settlement" was actually supposed to be in the 10s of millions but held the option to make Zuckerberg and Sandberg personally liable
[13:48:01] <joepie91> unfortunately
[13:48:22] <joepie91> theskillwithin: absolutely not. given enough enforcement capacity, the GDPR can fine Facebook and Google into bankrupcy
[13:48:37] <joepie91> there is no upper limit to the total fine
[13:48:44] <joepie91> the numbers I mentioned above are per transgression
[13:48:55] <joepie91> the only reason that doesn't currently happen is political
[13:48:56] <sheetjs> for their roles in the opioid crisis, the sackler family walked away with 10+ billion
[13:49:06] <theskillwithin> that would be awesome actually
[13:49:30] <theskillwithin> but then you don't get google anymore in uk haha
[13:50:41] <joepie91> basically a lot of the DPAs are chronically underfunded, and therefore have trouble building enough capacity to investigate all offenders and make a solid case against them. there is no *financial* reason for this - the fines against especially the big players could *easily* bring in more funds than it cost to collect them. but politically there's neoliberals (ie. "business parties") with a strong position in many EU countries, and so it is in their
[13:50:41] <joepie91> best interest to not increase baseline funding to privacy authorities
[13:51:10] <joepie91> even the GDPR was begrudgingly passed, and only because it was extremely cleverly written
[13:51:25] <theskillwithin> so silly cuz in uk you have such little privacy in the first place lol
[13:51:32] <joepie91> like, it's not often that I am impressed by the quality of legislation, but seriously, the GDPR is a legitimately good read
[13:51:47] <joepie91> theskillwithin: the UK no longer subscribes to the GDPR, now that they have exited the EU, unfortunately

[14:03:48] <joepie91> theskillwithin: if you do not have customers/users who reside in the EU, then you are not subject to the GDPR
[14:04:10] <joepie91> and yes, blocking EU-residing users in some ways is indeed a valid, if rather crude, way to deal with this
[14:04:37] <joepie91> also, there is a very easy way to not have to care about the GDPR: don't process personal data
[14:04:38] <sheetjs> youtube employs a similar approach
[14:04:58] <sheetjs> "this content is not available in your country"
[14:05:18] <joepie91> and if you have a good reason to process personal data (eg. customer orders), then if you do what is sensible (clearly tell users what their data is used for, don't collect data unless it's actually necessary, and specify who to contact in case of problems), then you are basically 99% of the way to GDPR compliance

[14:05:38] <theskillwithin> i deal with medical data,  lots of laws
[14:05:54] <sheetjs> there's precedence by a big player to restrict content by geography
[14:06:03] <joepie91> sheetjs: not really related to local legislation, but rather to only having a license for certain countries, or local C&D/takedown orders
[14:06:07] <joepie91> oh in that sense
[14:06:08] <joepie91> right
[14:06:29] <joepie91> theskillwithin: I am concerned if you deal with medical data yet seem unwilling to understand privacy concerns :|

[16:32:02] <emx> I fetch an image using AJAX. The image-data is in a variable and I want to display the image on the web-page. The closest I cam is img.src = URL.createObjectURL(source); but I would have to convert image-data to a (media?) source. How do I do it (or is this the wrong approach?)

[16:34:02] <wez> Or do you mean XHR?
[16:34:42] <wez> emx: Those are old terms I pasted above, XHR is fetching something via a javascript / in a script run in your browser.
[16:34:51] <emx> wez, I use jQuery framework so I guess it's XHR.

It complains about eslint.  I installed the eslint package. same error. The odd thing is that I pulled the same code on osx and this procedure worked. I want to say that I think a while back I did this on a different debian buster computer and it

[19:47:08] <bulletsquid> For each entry I have in a DB table, I create a div element with that rows information. Now, I want the user to be able to click on the ID of each entry and trigger a onClick event that will send that entry's info elsewhere. How can I program a onClick event with client side JS and jquery when I do not know the IDs that will be on the HTML page until it is loaded?

[21:26:39] <ashnur> so there is a conflict of interest, because if you watch a Mike Acton video, performance is always about knowing exactly your hardware, your data, and what you are actually doing, meanwhile, in functional land we want to have pure functions that don't have side effects.

[22:16:12] <OhTheCode__> i've been learning Js for a year, i learned css pretty well. I haven't learnt react yet because i really want to learn the fundamentals well. recently been learning web components, going to learn babel next, i know eslint. just learnt ES 6 modules and webpack which helped a lot

[22:16:59] <Maxdamantus> enoq: as someone who's dealt with pom.xmls for over 5 years, I prefer the package.json model of "how to build".
[22:17:38] <Maxdamantus> enoq: in JS there is not necessarily any build step, since any compilation is optional.
[22:17:52] <enoq> Maxdamantus: right, it just never stays at a package.json
[22:18:23] <Maxdamantus> enoq: so if you want to opt in to using webpack or something, you have to describe that in your package.json, same goes with a pom.xml; if you want to opt into something unnecessary, you have to describe it in the pom.

[22:19:05] <enoq> right, tbh a tsconfig.json comes pretty close to my needs already
[22:19:23] <lantech19446> OhTheCode__: I've learned html and css been learning js for about a 2wks I'm doing a huge course on udemy which so far seems very good, I haven't made a decision yet whether I want to do devops webdev or programming but javascript developer seems to be appealing right now
[22:19:39] <enoq> it just feels bad setting up a toolchain when everything comes out of the box in other languages
[22:20:07] <Maxdamantus> But there is no universal base behaviour for npm packages.
[22:20:33] <enoq> you could probably get to an 80% one though
[22:20:34] <Maxdamantus> If I make an npm package, it's likely that the *only* build tool I'll use is tsc.
[22:20:41] <enoq> like good enough for almost any use case
[22:20:41] <Maxdamantus> but lots of people don't use tsc.

[22:21:58] <OhTheCode__> lantech19446 - i learn more from books than youtube and videos, u learn faster and at a deeper level in my experience. There are a quite few online books that are well worth it - eg eloquent JS

[22:24:01] <lantech19446> OhTheCode__: I'm still getting my brain back it's nice to be able to read again and not have thing turn into a wall of text but i'm still preferring video instruction for most things
[22:24:51] <enoq> maybe worded differently: I'm looking for a way to skip most configuration and set up the most popular tools for linting (eslint), testing (jest) and tsc
[22:25:48] <enoq> like: npm install good-enough-build-pipeline && npm run build
[22:26:12] <vqueiroz> Is it possible to pre-process audio before passing it to RTCPeerConnection?
[22:27:29] <OhTheCode__> lantech19446 - video is more comfortable, but u learn deeper and faster if u read books in my experience. There is a lot to learn, videos are good when u are tired and nice and easy but i love books too. Learn fast

[22:30:31] <enoq> Maxdamantus: yeah, forget pom for a moment :P
[22:31:25] <Maxdamantus> enoq: if you want something other than the standard mojos to work, you have to describe them as build plugins, which imo is more obscure than defining a "script" in package.json.
[22:33:22] <systemfault> ^
[22:33:42] <enoq> yeah, then go the script route :D
[22:34:46] <Maxdamantus> I wouldn't describe eslint/jest/tsc as universally standard.
[22:34:57] <Maxdamantus> I've never used the first two.
[22:34:58] <systemfault> eslint should be at this point...
[22:35:48] <systemfault> But Jest sucks for backend testing (IMHO), I'd rather use Mocha + Chai.... and I use tsc
[22:35:53] <Maxdamantus> and if you're using tsc, you pr,bably shouldn't be using eslint or whatever its successor is.

[22:37:18] <Maxdamantus> Ah okay, so maybe eslint also supports typescript.
[22:37:19] <austincheney_> I use eslint for code style enforcement

[22:37:27] *** austincheney_ is now known as austincheney
[22:37:50] <systemfault> Maxdamantus: It does with a plugin, tslint was killed a while ago.
[22:38:03] <austincheney> I have rules that look for "this", bind, call, apply, and other unnecessary hazards
[22:39:09] <systemfault> Functional programming in TS is fun, sad that the majority of the TS devs go the Java-style OOP route...

[22:51:53] <austincheney> faLUKE, you cannot use document.getElementById or query selectors to find multiple elements with equivalent id values
