[14:30:47] <NeoVoid[m]> may be at 8th i was 15or 16

[14:36:32] <NeoVoid[m]> The typical "boring" perspective toward education of kids/folks makes them miss out so much cool gems.

[15:53:53] <NeoVoid[m]> also the structure they have created right now is so dope. I am so jealous of new era of kids now.
[15:58:44] <hemish> i started using linux bare metal while dualbooting casually and primarily using windows in 9th class, shifted to beginner distros in 10th and advanced distros at the end of 10th and now i am at end of 11th, lockdown was so great for learning
[15:59:35] <hemish> yes i am too jealous of new policies, but they arent gonna be implemented for 1-2 more years, even if they are implemented, it depends on school to give good education
[16:00:44] <hemish> our school had programming at very early than other schools, but it was in books and teacher never told it, they for the sake of assessment, asked "Open <> this page number and write the code written there in notepad, save it and execute it and just show me the output of only 1 program"
[16:02:25] <hemish> so no students literally learnt it
[16:02:38] <hemish> those who were interested including me learned by ourselves
[16:14:34] <vlad[m]> implementation will take a while
[16:14:44] <vlad[m]> but it's for the better
