[02:34:30] <Sapphirus> Only thing that jackknifes me on the issue of guns is I think self-defense shouldn't be a criminal act.
[02:34:55] <MootPoot> Nobody really thinks that it should 
[02:35:05] <MootPoot> Nobody significant at least 
[02:35:22] <MootPoot> It's more of "how do we stop all these domestic, gang and mass shootings"
[02:35:39] <Sapphirus> In Canada here, it's not so clear cut on how to legally defend yourself.
[02:36:00] <Sapphirus> There have been gun owners who've successfully defended themselves and got acquitted.
[02:36:44] <Sapphirus> But usually you have to be abiding by the law to the tee, including all storage laws, etc
[02:37:01] <MootPoot> There was that one guy who got put away though
[02:37:10] <MootPoot> Don't remember if he was American or Canadian 
[02:37:12] <emmeka> Sapphirus in practice Canadian law upholds the right to self defence so long as the shooter is white and the victim is not.
[02:37:26] <emmeka> see, Colten Boushie.
[02:37:32] <JesseDesu> the guy in florida who defended himself from 3 burglars just as he was done cleaning his AR-15 is the one case that rifle did any good
[02:37:39] <Sapphirus> emmeka, nah, I think iirc it has to do with who attacked first.
[02:37:39] <MootPoot> But he blind fired into pitch black darkness and hit a criminal running away 
[02:37:50] <emmeka> it's still amazing to me the actual claim of the defence in that case

[02:38:25] <MootPoot> I think 
[02:38:38] <MootPoot> You can't shoot a guy whos just trying to run off with your TV 
[02:38:56] <MootPoot> He has to actively be trying to kill you

[02:39:16] <JesseDesu> shoot first ask questions later
[02:39:37] <JesseDesu> better tried by 12 than buried in 6
[02:39:44] <JesseDesu> a gun owner told me that lol
[02:39:51] <Sapphirus> when he's trying to kill you, then you to hope to god the gun is stored legally according to law.
[02:39:55] <emmeka> he was unarmed, but trying to steal a vehicle. the guy walked up to him and shot him dead. now, the defence's account of the events was this: the guy fired his gun into the air as a warning shot, and unknowingly his gun hang-fired (that is, the round was struck by the hammer without going off right away)
[02:40:16] <MootPoot> ????
[02:40:24] <MootPoot> I thought warning shots weren't allowed 
[02:40:25] <emmeka> then, he walked up to the car where Colten Boushie was, reached into the car with the hand that held the gun, and tried to take his keys so he couldn't leave
[02:40:38] <emmeka> at this point, the hang fire discharged
[02:40:43] <emmeka> and killed him.
[02:40:47] <MootPoot> The only time you shoot is when you absolutely need to and the attacker is trying to kill you 
[02:41:06] <emmeka> that's the actual version of events he put forward. it defies belief. but a white jury acquitted him.

[02:42:12] <emmeka> in this country?
[02:42:25] <emmeka> I mean the whole thing was theatre

[02:46:29] <JesseDesu> the Berlin36 wall
[02:46:55] <emmeka> gotta remember we're less than 3 decades removed from total genocide
[02:47:15] <Sapphirus> Did the RCMP oversee this? I wouldn't be surprised then if they were the ones who did a shit job.
[02:47:31] <emmeka> Sapphirus RCMP doesn't prosecute
[02:47:39] <MootPoot> The crown does 
[02:47:41] <MootPoot> Methinks
[02:47:42] <Sapphirus> NO, but they have to go to the crown to present their case.
[02:47:46] <emmeka> but it also doesn't matter, because the prosecution didn't fuck up
[02:47:46] <Sapphirus> No*
[02:47:55] <Sapphirus> Oh, they didn't even?
[02:47:59] <emmeka> the defence's version of events was easily undermined by experts
[02:48:08] <emmeka> and yet, he was acquitted anyway
[02:48:33] <Sapphirus> that's strange.
[02:48:55] <Sapphirus> Did the Jury think "guy was just defending himself against this CRIMINAL?"
[02:49:03] <Sapphirus> That's literally the only thing I can think of.
[02:49:09] <emmeka> yes pretty much.
[02:49:16] <Sapphirus> lmao go figure
[02:49:55] <emmeka> it was just theatre, the guy's story was obviously bullshit beyond any doubt, but he was acquitted because it provided an easy way to just let the guy off when the jury thought he'd done the right thing
[02:50:49] <Sapphirus> That's always a possibility with a jury trial.
[02:51:15] <Sapphirus> Jury could decide it was morally justifiable even if it's criminally wrong.
[02:51:19] <emmeka> the right thing being shooting an unarmed native guy who wasn't threatening violence and was in fact trying to flee
[02:51:36] <ButterNoodle> damn
[02:51:39] <ButterNoodle> whats wrong with canada
[02:51:48] <Sapphirus> You could perhaps argue that he'd be alive had he not broken into some randos vehicle in the first place.
[02:51:55] <emmeka> ButterNoodle the country seems friendly until you realize it's basically an apartheid state
[02:51:56] <Sapphirus> ButterNoodle, we're a bit retarded.

[02:52:30] <emmeka> Sapphirus you could, but generally we don't execute car thieves
[02:53:34] <MootPoot> should I pop you in the face for double parking your car and poking into my slot? You would've been alive if you just followed the rules and didn't
[02:54:05] <emmeka> like sure, he pulled a gun on a thief. and shot into the air on his own property. fine. probably reckless, but probably not criminal.
[02:54:07] <Sapphirus> No, that's true, I'm just steel manning the jury's likely justification for why they acquitted him.
[02:54:39] <emmeka> but then after they tried to flee and got the car stuck, he walked up, reached into the window, and shot him point blank in cold blood
[02:54:51] <MootPoot> with the way the crown likes to handle firearm infractions - shooting a gun in the air would probably be a negligant discharge anyway

[02:57:31] <Sapphirus> Sometimes you encounter scenarios within any trial-by-jury type justice system wherein the moral right will supersede the criminal sanctions.
[02:57:43] <MootPoot> ahhh
[02:57:48] <MootPoot> that gets better every time I see it
[02:57:59] <Sapphirus> I think that's what likely happened and I can't think of a better explanation.

[06:47:49] <amigojapan> YandereNoises: and hamburger was not bad either
[06:48:10] *** Joins: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik)
[06:48:26] <YandereNoises> yeah, one of my go-to pizzas is actually pineapple and SAUSAGE
[06:48:33] <YandereNoises> better than canadian bacon or ham IMO
[06:48:49] <YandereNoises> also hamburger and eggplant is a great pizza, especially deep dish
[06:49:23] <amigojapan> YandereNoises: using the system where you "build your own pizza" I made pinnaple and jalapeño pizza
[06:50:31] <YandereNoises> nice
[06:50:36] <amigojapan> Ty
[06:50:41] <YandereNoises> yeah I like jalapeno with pineapple and sasuage
[06:50:56] *** Quits: aHick (~memes@71.219.184.252) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:50:57] <YandereNoises> sweet and spicy
[06:51:09] <amigojapan> Yeah
[06:51:10] <YandereNoises> actually a lot of pizzas benefit from some heat
[06:52:04] <YandereNoises> I kind of feel like you could just put jalapeño on any pizza and it'd be a good idea
[06:52:08] <amigojapan> YandereNoises: the one who may not be highlighted now would explode if he was here
[06:52:35] <YandereNoises> amigojapan: it's important for me to bully all the ops equally
[06:52:46] <amigojapan> Lol
[06:53:05] <amigojapan> YandereNoises: I did not mean voh
[06:53:10] <YandereNoises> oh

[06:54:53] <YandereNoises> amigojapan: what's your favorite (dessert) pie?
[06:55:28] <amigojapan> Pie Huh. My mom used to make lemon pie so I am partial to that
[06:56:51] <YandereNoises> interesting
[06:56:57] <YandereNoises> lemon is a decent option
[06:57:20] <YandereNoises> like lemon meringue?
[06:57:53] <amigojapan> Yes YandereNoises lemon merengue
[06:58:17] <amigojapan> YandereNoises: only one shop sells it in Tokyo
[06:58:51] <amigojapan> And the name of the shop is "lemon pie"

[06:59:19] <amigojapan> They sell other stuff too
[07:00:00] <amigojapan> YandereNoises: they limit to one pie per customer. I wanted to buy 2. You need to reserve it
[07:00:17] <YandereNoises> amigojapan: I'm kind of in a bad mood tonight (hence the nick) because I'm overtired and stressed out about making pies, and feeling like my family doesn't appreciate them enough

[07:04:43] <YandereNoises> beaky: they also have 横パイ
[07:05:32] <YandereNoises> amigojapan: I usually enjoy baking, but sometimes it can be stressful just because things take a while if you want to do them right
[07:06:21] <amigojapan> I see YandereNoises 
[07:06:23] <YandereNoises> I think 横パイ makes me laugh almost as much as 飯テロ
[07:06:26] <YandereNoises> top 2 japanese words
[07:07:14] <amigojapan> I wonder which my favourite Japanese word is, have not given it enough thought
[07:08:47] <YandereNoises> I mean I'm picking silly slang, not things I want tattooed on my back or whatever
[07:10:13] <amigojapan> YandereNoises: what would you have tattooed onto your back?
[07:10:29] <amigojapan> 安全第一
[07:12:16] <YandereNoises> amigojapan: well it's coolest to get a single kanji if you want a totally cool tattoo right?

[10:14:47] <Satin> one of the only drawbacks to the whole thing of going via that route is slow ppl in front of you

[10:18:20] <ButterNoodle> if I dont get exiled to tx next year.. I'ma do it
[10:18:27] <Satin> also this was annoying, somewhere in nebraska
[10:18:37] <Satin> one amazon prime truck on the right refusing to slow down
[10:18:40] <Satin> to let the other lagger pass
[10:18:46] <Satin> and then holding a bunch of cars behind them 
[10:18:48] <ButterNoodle> its like that ALL THE TIME
[10:18:55] <Satin> why do these dumbasses try to pass each other for no reason
[10:19:03] <ButterNoodle> they are cunts
[10:19:08] <Satin> and at the very least the amazon truck on the right could have slowed down
[10:19:11] <ButterNoodle> I call the cops on them
[10:19:14] <Satin> i purposely got behind him, and then gave him lots of space
[10:19:22] <Satin> to try to give him a chance to slow down
[10:19:28] <ButterNoodle> more than 5 min in the fast lane.. you can call the state police on them in indiana
[10:19:32] <Satin> instead of the car behind me on the right lane coming too close to him/her
[10:19:33] <Satin> but nope
[10:19:38] <Satin> lol really? wow
[10:20:01] <ButterNoodle> when I use to commute 2.5 hrs a day.. I called all the time when they would do that shit
[10:20:17] <Satin> emmeka: you're correct also, but there's a reason why i like driving in the dark, through places like that especially
[10:20:31] <Satin> i don't have to see the vast flat farmlands for miles with barely anyhting in the dark
[10:20:31] <ButterNoodle> justice when I seen the cops comming with their lights on
[10:20:32] <emmeka> drives me *nuts* when people do that. the primary highway through these parts is a 3 lane with alternating passing lanes
[10:20:47] <ButterNoodle> yea
[10:21:13] <emmeka> and there's fucking ALWAYS some trucker who wants to use the entire passing lane segment to pass another truck by going like 5kmh faster
[10:21:14] <ButterNoodle> get about 1hr north of year, its flat and boring until chicago
[10:21:24] <ButterNoodle> get about 1hr north of here, its flat and boring until chicago
[10:21:24] <Satin> emmeka: yeah lol
[10:21:30] <ButterNoodle> indiana sucks
[10:21:36] <ButterNoodle> same w kentucky
[10:21:36] <Satin> i don't mind them doing that if there's no one around them, which happens sometimes especially at dark
[10:21:41] <Satin> but when you have a relatively packed highway
[10:21:46] <Satin> why would you try to overtake another semi like that lMAO
[10:21:56] <Satin> for just barely going a few miles above them

[12:50:36] <Satin> hans: it was a very simple assignment, but C/C++ is complex for any new person to programming
[12:50:56] <Satin> and they didn't even teach him about functions or anything first, he had not the slightest clue and they had such expectations in the assignment
[12:50:57] <Satin> weird
[12:52:11] <hans> haha did they teach him goto and global variables?
[12:52:19] <Satin> no i don't think so lol
[12:52:34] <Satin> but it just makes me angry at programming classes in general
[12:52:43] <Satin> even in my experience, though it was less bad than what my romanian friend is experiencing
[12:53:08] <Satin> i got As in intro and OOP classes in community college before i transferred schools to my current one
[12:53:29] <Satin> both intro to programming and OOP at that school used C++, and it was an awful experience.
[12:53:55] <Satin> one class used codeblocks bullshit, small problems, repeaetive, copypaste almost math equation like bullshit snippets
[12:54:02] <Llamamoe> Someone give me ideas for how to meet fellow ADHD/autistic/trans people IRL
[12:54:04] <Satin> or was just too tedious without teaching much
[12:54:26] <Satin> Llamamoe: do you even want to try meeting people like that? I don't know if it's worth trying to actively pursue
[12:54:32] <Satin> you might not want what you're looking for
[12:55:33] <Satin> hans: but yeah i don't even understand C++ or anything much about OOP but I got A grades in that class, and the teaching was awful. professor droning on and on, while no one understood him

[12:56:13] <Satin> so of course we didn't understand shit about why a certain piece of included code was there, and we just had to type it by hand from paper
[12:56:14] <Satin> so stupid
[12:56:37] <hans> lovely 
[12:56:45] <Llamamoe> Satin: I'm sick of having nobody to spend time with IRL
[12:56:50] <Llamamoe> And I am lonely, too 
[12:57:12] <Llamamoe> I'm tired of neurotypical people being neurotypical people tbh 
[12:57:23] <Satin> ??
[12:57:43] <Satin> I don't understand the last part
[12:57:53] <Satin> what's this about neurotypical people being neurotypical?
[12:58:29] <Llamamoe> I'm just tired of how shallow their understanding of everything is and how void of empathy for being dysfunctional they are
[12:58:30] <Satin> I understand what you mean by being lonely and stuff, but I'm just cautioning against the idea of specifically looking for people that are ADHD/trans etc in particular
[12:58:43] <Satin> Llamamoe: ADHD, autistic, and trans people are not often different at all?
[12:58:52] <Llamamoe> Satin: They have actual empathy 
[12:58:57] <Satin> nah
[12:59:00] <Satin> not particularly
[12:59:26] <Satin> I don't know about where you live of course, and you might be right for that side of the world
[12:59:51] <Satin> but I can def tell you that whether someone is trans or adhd or autistic or not is not a prerequisite or decider of whether their personality will be emphatic, mature, or considerate
[12:59:54] <Satin> that's up to the individual
[13:00:14] <Satin> there's plenty of utterly narastistic self centred autists and trans people i've met
[13:00:27] <Satin> and plenty of nice people, and of course, plenty of in-between
[13:00:54] <Llamamoe> In my experience, neurotypical people all just try to abuse you into being able to function
[13:01:10] <Llamamoe> Saying shit like "look you managed to do X", or "you just need to push yourself", or "have you tried meditating"
[13:01:16] <Llamamoe> They're all ableistic shits 
[13:01:25] <Matt|home> morgen.
[13:01:40] <Satin> I don't know about that, I don't know about this whole neurotypical vs neurodivergent to be fair
[13:01:59] <Llamamoe> Every single conversation with neurotypes ends up devolving into me being forced to try to prove that yeah I'm actually really dysfunctional and please stop trying to force me to say I'm not 
[13:02:02] <Satin> but in and of itself, encouraging or nudging people to do better in their life to self improve is not bad to me
[13:02:29] <Llamamoe> It works when you're a fully able person temporarily down in life, it doesn't work when you're a dysfunctional ADHD CPTSD mess 
[13:02:37] <Satin> Sounds like you talk to people who are unable to comphrend the ways in which a person genuinely can't do things
[13:02:42] <Llamamoe> In those cases they just keep trying to push you without respecting your actual struggles 
[13:02:46] <Satin> Llamamoe: just tell them it's unsolicated advice in their part?
[13:02:48] <Satin> on*
[13:03:03] <Satin> I don't think the idea of encouraging or nudging people to help themselves is fundamentally bad or badly intentioned
[13:03:14] <Llamamoe> Eh
[13:03:16] <Llamamoe> Forget it

[20:11:43] <Sadale> I know

[20:12:00] <Sadale> Just like how davic always fucking with me
[20:12:15] <Sadale> zoidberg, same :3
[20:12:49] <zoidberg> it's alright though, it isn't like I'm craving for their approval
[20:12:55] <ButterNoodle> yea
[20:12:57] <zoidberg> I came to terms with it
[20:12:58] <Sadale> My imouto and I often bring up if it's ok to be lewd. Basically I think that it's ok, and she thinks that it isn't xD
[20:13:27] <Sadale> The argument never ends. And we kind of enjoy it as long as I don't go overboard with the lewd content. xD

[21:08:17] <Bco1981> i did blow a fuse...
[21:08:29] <Berlin36>  why the fuck cfdisk doesn't see my disk
[21:08:45] <Berlin36> fdisk does great and sees everything...
[21:09:33] <Berlin36> h o w is that possible
[21:09:42] <Berlin36> if i enter cfdisk, it only sees my installation medium

[21:21:36] <Satin> any reccomendations for getting into hardware programming stuff?
[21:21:48] <Satin> i've always heard the word ardiuno over the years and rsapberry pi but idk shit about it
[21:22:12] <zoidberg> arduino isn't hardcore, is it?
[21:22:17] <Bco1981> all i know is, not so good for desktop replacement.
[21:22:22] <zoidberg> it's embedded programming Satin 
[21:22:51] <zoidberg> arduino is built around atmel's 8bit risc microcontrollers
[21:23:06] <zoidberg> Satin: it's quite easy to get into
[21:23:26] <MootPoot> make sure to never use an arduino on a risc-y day
[21:23:31] <MootPoot> especially for women
[21:24:49] <Satin> hmmm i see
[21:25:20] <Sadale> Berlin36, If you've got a phone, USB tethering may help
[21:25:22] <MootPoot> Satin: its easy to get into but not cheap - compared to other software at least
[21:25:34] <MootPoot> you're looking at at least 30-50 bucks in stuff 
[21:25:42] <MootPoot> fortunately many decent starter packs online
[21:26:01] <zoidberg> Satin: embedded C is same as C but apart from that download atmega32 or any datasheet you're interested in
[21:26:07] <Sadale> Berlin36, not sure if it'd work for arch linux installation media. But for my current completely installed linux desktop, I can connect my phone to my computer via USB and enable network tethering on my smartphone. Then my computer can access the internet.
[21:26:19] <Terminus> Satin: get a nodemcu. they have an ESP8266 on them. they're like $5. they're powerful enough for simple things and they have wifi too.
[21:26:25] <zoidberg> Satin:those datasheets are really good
[21:26:31] <MootPoot> Satin: personally for somebody who's already somewhat experienced in C++ like you I'd point you towards the raspberry pi pico or esp8266 boards, they can take C++
[21:26:36] <MootPoot> it'll reduce your learning curve
[21:26:41] <Berlin36> thx Sadale , ill give it a try
[21:27:02] <Sadale> Satin, I'd recommend Arduino for starter. It's more hardware-y than raspberry pi.
[21:27:04] <zoidberg> there are also atmel's 32 bit microcontrollers
[21:27:07] <MootPoot> jesus fuck my phone BURNS through batery
[21:27:11] <Satin> thanks guys, noted this down. I don't plan on buying one immediatly or anything, but I want to understand the landscape and what's out there, so having these names to save in my mental notes is nice
[21:27:20] <MootPoot> Sadale: the pico is similar - its a microcontroller
[21:27:25] <MootPoot> not a SBC
[21:27:28] <Sadale> raspberry pi is just a linux computer with GPIO really.
[21:27:31] <MootPoot> it just takes C++
[21:27:33] <zoidberg> Satin: I had this book back in the day, https://www.amazon.com/Embedded-C-Programming-Atmel-AVR/dp/1418039594

[21:34:37] <Terminus> Satin: anyway, you can do a ton of things with just an ESP8266. i'd say only look at other MCUs when you actually need more processing power already. the ESP8266 even has an ADC although it's not really that accurate.
[21:34:39] <Sadale> Not that OOP is absolutely required for anything. It's just popular somehow. So you might as well want to learn it somewhere. It doesn't have to be C++ tho

[21:47:03] <Sadale> This service has been avialable in the domestic market since like forever
[21:47:17] <zoidberg> I used to go to store and buy parts, it was cheaper that way
[21:47:19] <Sadale> zoidberg, you missed 7-segment LEDs :P
[21:47:25] <zoidberg> nooooooooooo
[21:47:36] <zoidberg> damn, how did I miss that
[21:47:40] <Sadale> zoidberg, and now I'm using it on my clock. xD
[21:47:53] <zoidberg> sweet mother of god, 7 segment leds are work of god!
[21:48:03] <Sadale> zoidberg, I've made the clock in a way that it's possible to define custom messages to be shown on the clock. And you could get the 7-segment display to show literally anything.
[21:48:25] <zoidberg> awesome Sadale 
[21:48:36] <Sadale> in a way that you can define if each of the segment of the LED is to be lit or not.
[21:48:48] <MootPoot> Arduino was good for it's time 
[21:48:57] <MootPoot> Now that the rp2020 is here 
[21:49:07] <MootPoot> Especially for only 5 dollars a board 
[21:49:22] <MootPoot> No point unless you need the IO of a mega 
[21:49:26] <zoidberg> honestly I was a bit overwhelmed going from atmega to at91sam
[21:49:38] <zoidberg> rpi is just too much for me
[21:49:43] <Sadale> It'll take time for rp2020 to gain traction. And if you're doing mass production, I'm not sure how secure is the stock of rp2020 is.
[21:49:50] <zoidberg> it feels more of just programming
[21:49:59] <MootPoot> Well , it's pretty good as it is Sadale

[21:50:06] <Satin> it's $50
[21:50:08] <Sadale> For atmega328p tho the supply is secure. And there're even clones for that
[21:50:12] <Satin> he's not using it at all
[21:50:13] <MootPoot> Look at it this way, the rpi4 is hard to get now 
[21:50:20] <Sadale> Satin, nice :D

[21:50:43] <MootPoot> Rp2020 stock seems to be super available
[21:50:45] <Satin> zoidberg: just surprised ig
[21:50:49] <Satin> my brother bought one
[21:50:52] <Satin> he doesn't know programming
[21:51:04] <MootPoot> Sadale: I can get like upto 100 picos in one order from my retailer 
[21:51:27] <Sadale> MootPoot, I honestly don't see the point of rp2020 with all those boards like bluepill and nucleo boards being around. It looks like just another microcontroller board to me.
[21:51:51] <Sadale> MootPoot, and for bluepill, it's even cheaper than rp2020.
[21:52:02] <zoidberg> Satin: rpi can be used even if doesn't know programming, it's like pc where you can install linux os straight up
[21:52:27] <Sadale> oh. RP2040 has more flash and RAM
[21:52:31] <Berlin36> aight, managed to build the wifi drivers

[21:53:55] <MootPoot> same, unless you need wifi, the  rp2020 is the better board

[21:54:15] <Satin> Berlin36: normal DE you mean?
[21:54:16] <Sadale> Actually I think ESP32 could just be as cheap as rp2040

[21:54:24] <Berlin36> oh
[21:54:25] <Berlin36> lol
[21:54:26] <zoidberg> I remember esp32
[21:55:16] <Sadale> Anyway this rp2040 just doesn't interest me.
[21:55:42] <MootPoot> if you dont really need the additional stuff I can see why
[21:55:58] <Terminus> Satin: that's skimping on a lot of stuff. there's a better board with a bunch of pins.
[21:56:08] <Satin> Oh.
[21:56:10] <MootPoot> but the price is the same for me, its much more powerful, the IDE is better , and it can take advantage of normal C++ libraries to do stuff
[21:56:12] <zoidberg> Satin: like Sadale said, if you start with 8bit mc, you have to learn/mess about/mess electronics too.
[21:56:31] <zoidberg> so are you interested in electronics or just programming?

[21:57:58] <Satin> same for Kubuntu, but with KDE Plasma
[21:58:07] <Sadale> For Satin tho I'd still recommend Arduino over raspi pico and raspi 4. Just to get a hang of how firmware programming works. Anyway real firmware programming is nowhere as easy as using Arduino library.
[21:58:08] <Satin> Berlin36: you don't need to delete it necessarily, just install i3wm alongside it
[21:58:10] <zoidberg> delete xfce?

[21:59:54] <Sadale> ARM asm. As if she'd ever need to use that.
[22:00:07] <Satin> Sadale: she's a CS major too?
[22:00:12] <Sadale> Even I barely need to use that as a firmware dev.
[22:00:22] <Sadale> Satin, nope.

[22:44:54] <Satin> MootPoot: I mean it's a balancing act really, on one hand the west has an incentive to fearmonger a lot, because china is an upcoming power that challenges them

[22:45:37] <Satin> is a possibility as well, as chinese influence grows and grows
[22:46:00] <Satin> so just read in between the lines and make choices is all I guess I'd have to say
[22:46:14] <Satin> instead of a very wide and sweeping generalization
[22:46:15] <Sapphirus> Yeah, buying Chinese phones from a Chinese company is akin to directly giving money to the CCP.
[22:46:26] <Satin> if some ZTE phone or whatever fits your use case, go for it? be cautious?

[22:47:11] <MootPoot> idk at this point like I said - I'm convinced every mobile device is compomised , but Id rather send my browser history to teh chinese
[22:47:14] <MootPoot> emmeka: my thoughts exactly
[22:47:21] <Satin> yeah ofc, I pick the neolibs, but the fearmongering is too real as well
[22:47:25] <Satin> just like
[22:47:38] <Sapphirus> Except these companies are heavily controlled by the state, so the lines are quite blurry.
[22:47:51] <Satin> be nuanced idk, it's an upcoming superpower/significant nation state with lots of influence to change the UN and such and there's nothing the west can ultimate do to stop that
[22:48:07] <Satin> Sapphirus: that is true to some extent, but it's not like that doesn't happen in the US either

[22:48:52] <Sapphirus> Whilst that may be true, you can't reach a certain size in China without having the state coming along.
[22:48:54] <Satin> of course i'm ultimately american yada yada, but I wouldn't be quick to draw some rapid generalization that says "if yuo buy a chinese phone ur giving money to the ccp" and preaching about the american system being better, when it's about the same in intent
[22:49:13] <Satin> any defense contractor in the US is heavily influenced and interlinked with the US government
[22:49:19] <MootPoot> chinese girls are cuter after all
[22:49:26] <Satin> US tech firms that reach a certain size are forced to work with the government
[22:49:29] <emmeka> like, a Chinese phone coming with a censorship list is pretty mild compared to the fact that literally every device from an American company comes backdoor'd for the American government, and every American tech service is not only carefully molding the digital spaces they provide to uphold American global order, but also providing your information directly to the state.
[22:49:34] <Sapphirus> Whilst any Chinese company of a certain size is heavily influenced by the Chinese communist party.
[22:49:36] <MootPoot> I'd rather be tied up and abused  by cute chinese girls rather then some dudes in guantanamo
[22:49:37] <Satin> see: Snowden leaks on the PRISM program

[22:50:38] <emmeka> Sapphirus except this is basically also the case of any American tech company and the US government.
[22:50:43] <Satin> I'm not saying we shouldn't be wary of the chinese or anything, but we shouldn't be naive or delusional that we're part of the better or whatever system lmao
[22:50:45] <emmeka> so, pick your poison.
[22:50:52] <emmeka> at least the CCP can't actually do anything to me
[22:51:34] <Satin> and you can also really question if scrutinizing your smartphone maker's nationality is the right thing
[22:51:40] <MootPoot> they could kill you if they wanted to, but they dont have a history of yeeting western civvies unlike the US does
[22:51:47] <Sapphirus> Not quite. You'd be naive to think the CCP doesn't have sleepers in the west. 
[22:51:47] <Satin> when the american company you're buying from is closely knit with supply chains in china

[22:59:54] <emmeka> why, though.
[23:00:00] <Sapphirus> One is us and our allies, and the other is a hostile regime which opposes our way of life.

[23:06:59] <emmeka> I mean obviously China's internal politics are less than ideal, but Chinese international relations, with a few exceptions, are a massive step up from the yankee way

[23:07:16] <Bco1981> yes
[23:07:43] <Sapphirus> emmeka, I wouldn't necessarily agree. Not with the way they've been hostile towards Taiwan as of late.
[23:07:54] <Satin> emmeka: idk about that
[23:07:57] <Satin> maybe broadly you're right
[23:08:13] <Sapphirus> Belt and road seems very much imperialistic. 
[23:08:15] <Satin> but the minute someone speaks critically about them, they're incredibly hositle
[23:08:21] <emmeka> Sapphirus that would be under "with a few exceptions"
[23:08:28] <emmeka> America's idea of international relations is use treaties, the IMF, the world bank and/or the military to secure any domination over any country they can to further their own country.

[23:09:46] <Satin> emmeka:  for now
[23:09:56] <Sapphirus> Problem emmeka is that if you were to remove the U.S.'s influence from the equation, you'd create a power vacuum for the CCP and its allies to take advantage of.
[23:09:58] <Satin> emmeka: there's a reason AUS and PH are alarmed by china a lot
[23:10:05] <Satin> it's not an immediate threat of course
[23:10:15] <Satin> and of course it's not comparable to the US doing what it did in south america and the middle east
[23:10:26] <Satin> but it's not like they're that different conceptually or anything
[23:10:46] <Sapphirus> U.S.'s untold influence is really the only thing holding the CCP back from going full horse.
[23:10:47] <Satin> and as the chinese military grows, i'll turn into a 2nd russia utilizing it cleverly for those ends
[23:10:47] <emmeka> Satin it's quite different, though. China has very different ideas about its position in global affairs and in Asia than the US did about its own backyard.
[23:11:13] <emmeka> not that it's a vision those neighbouring countries want
[23:11:16] <Satin> in the present sure, because it's forced to be in this position
[23:11:25] <Sapphirus> Satin, Australia's concerned a war may break out in the region within the next few years.
[23:11:41] <Satin> Sapphirus: unlikely, but that doesn't mean that detterence is important
[23:12:10] <Satin> Sapphirus: i'm generally not a big fan of war or anything, but aus was forced to go towards the US for the security pack/AUKUS nuclear sub deal
[23:12:22] <Satin> and that's good and important to balance things
[23:12:51] <Sapphirus> Keeping Taiwan away from the hands of the CCP is important for the sovereignty of Japan.
[23:13:01] <Satin> Sapphirus: no, taiwan is a gone deal
[23:13:11] <Satin> and very different than japan
[23:13:17] <emmeka> Satin I think that's projecting. You're assuming China just wants to supplant the United States in the world order, you're failing to imagine what Chinese characteristics would actually mean

[23:14:32] <Satin> emmeka: i don't think it wants to just supplant, but I also think at scale there's many shared characteristics. sure it might not be as heavy handed or outright as the US, but it's not any more novel or anything or more preferable IMO.
[23:14:53] <Satin> emmeka: for context then again, I'm not indian, but I grew up there, and india and china have had deadly exchanges this year, among other things
[23:15:27] <Satin> and i've grown up reading about chinese relations with nations in that region etc
[23:15:55] <Sapphirus> Indian border conflict is very nasty
[23:16:01] <Satin> it is
[23:16:15] <Sapphirus> I haven't been following it too closely, admittedly, but you don't have to read too much into it to know how scummy China is being.
[23:16:17] <Satin> i don't even pick sides in that stuff particularly, but chinese aggression is very real lol
[23:16:19] <emmeka> well, India specifically would probably have a bad time with a stronger China.
[23:16:39] <Satin> of course, there's a reason the "Quad" happened recently

[23:17:01] <emmeka> but China doesn't give a flying fuck about countries outside it's backyard insofar as they do trade and let Chinese capital do its thing, and in exchange, the Chinese actually bother developing places.
[23:17:20] <emmeka> it has no interest in replicating the IMF-style debt slavery of the USA

[23:19:42] <Satin> fair
[23:19:59] <Satin> hard to argue with that, the US has had the option to do more than just it's typical something billions of aid 
[23:20:03] <Satin> and it hasn't
[23:20:10] <emmeka> the biggest criticism I've seen is that China does indeed bring in its own workers and companies for their infrastructure projects, and doesn't hire locals, which is bad for their economies in the short term.
[23:20:11] <Satin> and the chinese actually are so
[23:20:31] <Satin> even though their ends are less than savoury, hard to argue with the on the ground effect that is more direct

[23:22:53] <Satin> except you see the state of african nations and all of that and how the aid is used and all
[23:22:58] <emmeka> look at Haïti, the poorest country in the hemisphere. How often has the United States forced "liberalization" and austerity, cutting services and opening trade to US exports to basically destroy their local economy.

[23:32:57] <emmeka> HeTo oh, they do. But each of those is a very different case, from each other and from the United States. France still thinks it's got some intrinsic role as babysitter and primary ideologue of its former colonies and seems intent on intervening in them directly when they deviate too far from the French way of things.
[23:33:08] <MootPoot> its kind of contextual
[23:33:23] <MootPoot> every country "does" things
[23:33:56] <emmeka> Russia is convinced it is a regional empire, only concerned with the rest of the world insofar as they interfere in what they consider their own sphere of influence. China doesn't give a flying fuck about anything so long as they get whatever resources they want and nobody pokes their nose in their "internal" affairs.
[23:33:58] <MootPoot> but like how a parent or a teacher or a boss automaically assumes they have authority to do things on a moral and legitmate level ( in other's eves and their own )
[23:35:32] <emmeka> the United States though considers itself the global arbiter of freedom, the rightful true power to run the world and shape it in its image, and considers all use of force - diplomatic, economic, military - to accomplish this to be legitimate
[23:36:15] <Jigsy> My jaw hurts...

[23:39:04] <emmeka> China has no interest in running this frozen backwater, they just want our resources, and they'll pay for them. The United States however not only doesn't play fair when it comes to trade, but forces us into certain geopolitical positions.

[23:44:37] <Satin> MootPoot: So for context, often when I'm thinking about politics when it comes to more abstract concepts like these - I'm thinking in terms of ideals. Therefore I'm not, to be clear, arguing on the behalf of the US or anything, or arguing that its end and goals are justified or anything of that sort.
[23:45:03] <MootPoot> yes, we get that
[23:45:07] <Satin> MootPoot: but to me, especially in geopolitics, there is no such thing as neutrality. If there is a vacumn there will be filled.
[23:45:21] <MootPoot> what we're saying is that your mindset is that of a american view on geopolitics
[23:45:47] <Satin> to an extent maybe, and I don't see any issue with that - yes respecting national soverignity and letting countries manage their own shit is important
[23:45:53] <emmeka> HeTo the Chinese don't tend to do that to other countries. They do that to their own country. I don't care what the Chinese do to their own country.
[23:46:04] <Satin> but when discussing ideals and political systems, those easily cross borders
[23:46:09] <Sapphirus> Satin, with that type of nuance, I'm surprised you thought I was just cheering for one side.

[23:48:19] <emmeka> the Chinese position is that they'll broadly leave everyone else alone insofar as we trade with them and take their capital and don't intervene in their affairs, this is beneficial to most countries.
[23:48:21] <Satin> no, i don't see anything wrong with influencing what goes on in other countries
[23:48:29] <Satin> yes that's a dangerous proposition
[23:48:32] <emmeka> Satin that's yankee brain parasites at work
[23:48:40] <Satin> but I don't believe there's any such thing as some natural order or anything
[23:48:49] <Satin> if it's not the US that will do that, it will naturally be some other country or china
[23:49:09] <Satin> and the type of "influence" i speak of is very different from what you see today with US diplomacy and all of that to be clear
[23:49:25] <Sapphirus> Becomes a question of if you'd rather prefer an authoritarian dictatorship or 'western democracy' taking the reigns.
[23:49:28] <Satin> but conceputally speaking or arguing it is unethical? nah. especially in a globalization-esclaated world lol
[23:49:42] <hassoon> dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooods
[23:49:53] <Satin> There is no such thing as neutrality in geopolitics. emmeka might be correct about current policy on some fronts
[23:50:14] <Satin> but taken to its logical conclusion, in some decades even china's interest and incentives will naturally align with influencing other countries, often in an interest of its own security
[23:50:19] <Sapphirus> I'd take that 'western democracy' any day of the week, no matter how much I despise a lot of what it stands for.
[23:50:25] <Satin> and it does the same as well in india and pakistan and plenty of other situations too
[23:50:39] <Satin> and it's already changing the wording in UN conventions using its influencen now
[23:50:40] <emmeka> the USA imposes its will and ideals and power on other countries, whether or not it has internal democracy is irrelevant. The way they engage with other countries is not democratic.
[23:50:47] <Satin> of what "human rights" mean and so on
[23:51:16] <Satin> it might sound trivial, but even simple things like this go a long way and are very much part of influencing one's system and way of thought on another
[23:51:19] <Sapphirus> So you'd rather replace it with an actual despot dictatorship in the global sphere of influence? 
[23:51:31] <Satin> emmeka: well yeah, the US's version of this stuff is garbage, i'm particular about not defending it
[23:51:48] <emmeka> Sapphirus if it wants to leave us alone and just engage in fair trade? yes.
[23:51:53] <Satin> emmeka: i'm just arguing the idea that it's wrong or not correct to influence or talk about changing ideals in other countries

[23:52:51] <emmeka> China has no interest in exporting its politics. In fact, their entire ideology is that their politics are peculiarly Chinese, that their entire system is inherent to "Chinese characteristics"

[23:55:09] <emmeka> things I wish were true
[23:55:12] <MootPoot> as in show up guns blazing - you are communist now
[23:55:22] <MootPoot> thank us later -

[23:55:24] <Sapphirus> In fact, the belt and road, proves that China is willing to be as imperialistic as the United States to export its own flavour palette of ideals.
[23:55:33] <Satin> even my most intense of communist friends will not argue that lolz
[23:55:40] <emmeka> the belt and road proves how different the Chinese model of these things is quite different
[23:55:40] <Satin> it's not some conspriacy theory or anything emmeka

[23:55:48] <Sapphirus> Throwing money at poor developing countries, entrapping them in debt slavery, all in order to create a sphere of influence.

[23:56:15] <Satin> time to read some yank-funded article probably
[23:56:17] <Satin> kek
[23:56:27] <MootPoot> using money to expand their influence so they can trade, unlike the americans who instead send some "freedom"
[23:56:28] <Satin> oh it's paywalled
[23:56:29] <Satin> of course
[23:56:34] <MootPoot> I think I'll take the money
[23:57:06] <emmeka> Satin no but I have directly worked with the CPUSA in the past and even been a dues paying member of a communist party in this country. Which you will probably take to mean I'm just covering things up or something. But basically I'm intimately familiar with the internal finances of these organizations, and I find the notion that they're getting some nice funding from the PRC to be funny
[23:57:08] <HeTo> MootPoot: they do also export weapons
[23:57:24] <emmeka> these organizations are all dead broke
[23:57:26] <Sapphirus> Satin, it's irritating to me how far the left in Canada will go in drooling over a communistic dictatorship.
[23:57:27] <MootPoot> HeTo: export weapons as in sell them - not shoot them at the other country
[23:57:28] <MootPoot> lmao
[23:57:34] <MootPoot> there's a difference between the two
[23:57:51] <Satin> emmeka: idk, my sources contridict that - and these are very left wing sources
[23:57:57] <Satin> but i see, i'll take your word for it
[23:57:58] <HeTo> MootPoot: yeah because they're even less weary about picking local despots to do their bidding than the US has been in Latin America
[23:58:21] <MootPoot> the point is that they interfere less
[23:58:24] <emmeka> the belt and road initiative comes with briefcases full of cash and builds infrastructure based on mutual agreements that they then turn over to the countries they build them for. Does that infrastructure benefit China? Of course. It isn't a charity.
[23:58:28] <HeTo> also China hasn't had the ability to do military campaigns like the US
[23:58:32] <MootPoot> so what if they pick a local 'despot'
[23:58:38] <Sapphirus> When something sounds like what a Chinese mouthpiece would spew, you should probably evaluate what you're saying with a critical lens. 
[23:58:42] <HeTo> I'd be very weary about confusing lack of ability with lack of will, given the ability
[23:58:50] <emmeka> but the point is they engage with other countries based on free agreements and mutual benefit, instead of imposing their will by force.
[23:59:12] <MootPoot> china is perfectly capable of pushing into africa millitarily or afghanistan if they wanted to, but they instead choose do use money

[23:59:33] * hassoon zanretsuken's emmeka 
[23:59:42] <HeTo> emmeka: they don't turn them over to the countries. instead when the country turns out not to be able to pay back the loan they start having more influence in the internal affairs of the country
[23:59:44] <Sapphirus> Whether it's money or military force, it's still indifferent to what the U.S. does.
[23:59:47] <MootPoot> they might not be able to conduct a drawn out extended war like the americans, but if they REALLY wanted to, picking on a random south asian / african / middle eastern state would be easy
