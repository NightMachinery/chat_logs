[00:21:38] <elpipo> Hi all,
[00:22:12] <elpipo> I'm looking for a feature I read 3 weeks ago but I didn't bookmark the page.
[00:23:01] <elpipo> It was about doing a kind of orphan branch from a master repository.
[00:23:12] <DoofusCanadensis> !orphan
[00:23:12] <gitinfo> To create an orphaned branch(unrelated to existing history): `git checkout --orphan newbranchname`. This will leave your index/worktree as-is(use `rm .git/index; git clean -dfx` to delete EVERYTHING). If you get 'error: unknown option `orphan`' see !orphan_old. For an empty/null commit see !orphan_null.
[00:23:29] <elpipo> Publishing it to work with some users
[00:24:13] <elpipo> And then being able to re attach it to the master saying : this initial commit is in fact this other commit in the master
[00:25:32] <DoofusCanadensis> oh, replacing master
[00:27:32] <elpipo> The article spot it was a way to reduce a huge repository to a small one. And if really needed to go in the past it was still possible explaining the way to do it in the first commit with the hash of the corresponding commit in the long history.
[00:28:03] <elpipo> I don't manage to find the right keyword to find again those articles.
[00:28:26] <DoofusCanadensis> replace commits in branch, iirc
[00:29:03] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah, add git to that and a few good articles pop up right away

[01:06:18] <yolo_> ikke: set autocrlf=true, git clone again, then run 'git add --renormalize' and all is good for the future? that git will work peacefully across windows/macos/linux?
[01:06:31] <yolo_> the current recommendation is by default set autocrlf=false
[01:06:56] <ikke> yolo_: You first need to make sure all files are consistent
[01:07:18] <ikke> and it's probably better to use .gitattribute files than to use core.autocrlf
[01:08:07] <ikke> yolo_: use something like dos2unix on all files
[01:08:41] <yolo_> ikke: the troubles occur when one developer is doing it under windows another is linux
[01:08:57] <yolo_> in my case i probably cloned a github pushed by some windows folks
[01:09:01] <ikke> yes, that's why a .gitattributes file works better
[01:09:12] <ikke> because it will make sure it will be consistent for everyone

[02:19:40] <wwalker> ok, one of the guys messed up, he did a `git add .` :shaking-head: then `git commit`, I've gotten him to do a git reset HEAD^ , so the file with proprietary stuff in it is no longer tracked.  How do I have him remove the git objects associated with that commit so that the proprietary data doesn't just "tag along" next time he does a push?
[02:19:46] *** Joins: diamond (~diamond@188.243.182.117)
[02:23:07] <imMute> wwalker: as long as it's not part of a commit that gets pushed it wont go along.  but some options for 'git gc' should be able to prune it sooner.
[02:23:18] <imMute> wwalker: if there's API keys or something in there, just change them anyway.
[02:27:49] <wwalker> imMute: Thank you!  I thought that it would "stay local" if it wasn't part of any commit, but wasn't sure, and I just found this, it looks like it should be both safe and effective: git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
[02:28:46] <wwalker> I'm not sure what all was in the commit, but it hasn't left his notebook yet, but he really doesn't want to lose some local branches.

[02:31:04] <mackerman>  !backup the local repo is usually a good safety precaution, even if it contains stuff that is not supposed to be pushed elsewhere.
[02:31:04] <gitinfo> Worried about your data while trying stuff out in your repo? The repository in its entirety lives inside the .git directory in the root of your work tree so to backup everything `cp -a path/to/workdir path/to/backup` or equivalent will suffice as long as the repo is not modified during backup. See also http://sethrobertson.github.com/GitBestPractices/#backups
[02:31:54] <mackerman>  Explict gc is not safe, if you are worried about losing stuff accidentally not reachable.

[05:03:31] <spaceone> j416: that's what i already do (git revert && git commit --ammend --fixup=...). but a shortcut would be better. i also don't want to drop that now, but only later when i do the squashing.

[16:07:31] <ccapndave> Thanks
[16:08:41] <canton7> ccapndave, bear in mind that when you rebase, git takes individual commits from the branch being rebased, and plays them onto the target branch, one after another. So at any given point, HEAD is the last commit you successfully rebased, and you're applying the next patch from the branch. So the conflict is between the code that's present as a
[16:08:41] <canton7> result of the last successfully-applied patch, and the next patch being applied

[19:59:50] <MTecknology> I have a branch that is modifying a couple files that were recently modified in master. I ran 'git merge master' and see one file listed as 'CONFLICT (modify/delete): path1 deleted ni HEAD and modified in master.' and two listed as 'Removing path2,3'. I'm struggling a bit to understand how to inspect these files and figure out what changed so that I can manually merge those changes. I
[19:59:56] <MTecknology> know that the files were removed in my branch, but that's because they go away in the new iteration. I'm just trying to sync up with recent changes to make sure it can cleanly merge.

[22:24:36] <mackerman> velix: If you want to do it that way, sure. There's more than one way to split a project into repos.
[22:25:03] <velix> mackerman: Yeah, that's why I asked for a good workflow. I guess, it's cleaner to handle because there should be a dev and a release branch.
[22:25:53] <ikke> velix: to be honest, I would try to start as simple as possible
[22:26:27] <mackerman> A repo is one thing with one history.
[22:26:59] <mackerman> If they aren't actually seperate,  one repo can also make sense.
[22:27:58] <velix> If we're doing it all in 1 repository, we'd have 4 branches :D
[22:28:18] <velix> backend-dev backend-release, frontend-dev frontend-release.
[22:28:22] <velix> Isn't that too complicated?
[22:28:37] <mackerman> That's not consistent with a repo being one thing.
[22:28:39] <velix> Since the frontend guy isn't working in backend at all.
[22:28:58] <ikke> Why would it mean that?
[22:29:07] <velix> ikke: me?

[22:30:01] <velix> Right now, he's doing stuff, nobody knows.
[22:30:10] <velix> That's why professor said: add some git.
[22:30:50] <velix> I've done some searching for other projects on github and most seem to split frontend and backend
[22:30:54] <ikke> velix: github flow is a fairly simple and popular workflow
[22:31:04] <velix> ikke: okay, let me read about it.
[22:31:18] <ikke> velix: It makes sense to split up work, but that does not mean each 'component' has it's own branch
[22:31:30] <ikke> or set of branches

[22:58:09] <velix> It's a github workflow only?
[22:59:16] <ikke> No
[22:59:18] *** Joins: Crispy (~ScatMan@101.187.236.231)
[22:59:30] <ikke> It's a general git workflow
[22:59:35] <ikke> it's just what they use at github

[23:00:08] <ikke> It basically means: deploy from master branch, use topic branches for merge/pull requests. Deploy directly and immediately from master
[23:00:24] <ikke> oh, and code review for merge requests

[23:09:43] <velix> But still the question: split front and backend? :D
