[10:03:16] <GodEater> eurgh. So it seems that hoping the the version of curl installed on a system can make use of the same cipher suite that openssl on the same system does was in vain.
[10:14:48] <bagder> GodEater: not even with a crafty --ciphers use?
[10:30:17] <GodEater> it looks like I need to tell the chap I'm trying to help that he has to lower the protocol used to SSLv3 as well. I'm getting "unknown protocol" from his endpoint when I try scanning it with openssl - so it's not just the ciphers in use which were the problem.

[12:18:30] <bagder> the apache CVE descriptions are very brief: https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html
[12:23:53] <Piru> ahh installed. that was fast
[12:27:16] <icing> bagder: I know.
[12:27:58] <gevaerts> Ok. Once I did the *right* thing, it looks like just updating the cert chain file on the server is enough, I don't need to touch the clients. I'll know for sure in three minutes (they all connect on the half hour)
[12:28:34] <bagder> gevaerts: I think it depends on the clients too, if they know how to do the right thing then
[12:29:29] <bagder> someone emailed me and asked me to modify curl.se and libssh2.org to better support openssl 1.0.2-clients
[12:29:44] <bagder> I had to say no
[12:30:13] <gevaerts> It does, but in *this* case it looks like I only need to change the server (which I can do, because I *know* which clients connect)
[12:30:25] <bagder> nice
[12:30:56] <gevaerts> Of course I don't know yet which things that don't have proper error reporting also fail :)
[12:32:48] <bagder> failing in silent is also a way to handle errors! =)
[12:33:22] <bagder> no complaints == fine
[12:33:41] <gevaerts> Exactly!
[12:34:29] <gevaerts> Anyway, *this* one works. I fixed the cert chain manually, so if I don't do it better it will break again in a few months, but at least it's no longer on fire
