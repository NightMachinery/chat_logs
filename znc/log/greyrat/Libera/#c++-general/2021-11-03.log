[00:38:04] <yolo_> range-view support is very partial, will range-v3 be api-compatible of I want to use ranges/views in my code today(a swap-in replacement)?
[00:38:45] <rpav> can't you always just continue using range-v3
[00:40:06] <rpav> i think the problem with a lot of these is they end up being watered-down in std, and it's like why use std when the original library was more robust

[01:02:39] <johnny> yolo_, it's not even api compatible in some places, check the bug reports
[01:03:48] <johnny> rpav, depends on where the watering down is though.  if the std implementation is a fine baseline, then it'd be nice to have the library just be sugar
[01:04:14] <johnny> add missing features, sand off some rough edges, that sort of thing
[01:04:29] <rpav> yeah except you can't extend std
[01:04:42] <johnny> well you can compose it
[01:05:13] <johnny> like it's possible to add say to<vector> or whatever they're gonna call it separately
[01:05:26] <rpav> yeah a select few
[01:05:34] <rpav> they're adding a conversion api? (finally?)
[01:05:48] <johnny> i think so
[01:05:57] <rpav> it'd be nice
[01:06:16] <rpav> i've been using to<T>(..) and cnv(x) as "explicit auto-conversion" for awhile
[01:06:19] <rpav> or x | to<y>
[01:06:58] <johnny> but the point is, it can be done separately
[01:07:15] <rpav> kinda
[01:07:33] <rpav> i mean you can't really change internal behaviors a whole lot, you can hack some utility stuff as necessary but often not the nicest thing
[01:08:33] <johnny> that depends on where the individual pain points are.  some of the missing stuff is just sugar,others might be more fundamental
[01:09:08] <johnny> like ranges diddn't necessarily need to ship enumerate or zip or even to, but it should be made in such a way that it's possible to do them
[01:09:37] <johnny> some of the issues are about the first, others are about the second. the ones that are about the second, are harder to fix by lib authors of course
[01:10:32] <johnny> i think the waters get muddied a bit when you have a library that implements ranges, and concepts, and also extensions beyond what's in the std, all in the same place

[01:28:09] <yolo_> range-v3 claims no back-compatability will be assured, unless you use range-v3::cpp20
[01:28:26] <yolo_> just installed it and see how that goes
[01:33:10] <johnny> but even so, in the bug reports for some implementation eric says "Yeah it should be like X, but i don't have time"
[01:34:30] <yolo_> i hope all oss projects, can use some license like: if you're big and rich and use my free stuff to make even more money, pay me a bit. to keep the valuable projects alive in the long run
[01:35:36] <yolo_> everything should have a pricing model including OSS projects: free for individual/other-OSS-projects and even free for small teams, but charge a bit for medium size company, charge more for large corps. In the end everyone wins.
[01:36:21] <yolo_> one reason I switched away from doctest(and back) is the author no longer has time, and nobody else picked up the work

[01:41:41] <yolo_> maybe I do not ned range-v3 then
[01:49:54] <yolo_> nope range-v3 provides way more stuff than c++11 has, so yes to range-v3
[01:50:19] <johnny> yolo_, the licensing part isn't the problem so much as a way to provide payments and have contracts
[01:51:06] <johnny> that's why you only really see it for bigger projects or folks who actually have a company around their work, like a consultancy
[01:51:28] <johnny> stuff like github sponsors helps at least part of it (as long as you're willing to let them have a cut)
[01:51:49] <johnny> but you cant' just have a contract wth no enforcement mechanism

[11:22:57] <LordKalma> Bill from Kitware will speak at Qt world summit. Let's see
[11:23:06] <KillAnimals> hey can you take a member function pointer argument and assign it to a function pointer that is not a member function pointer?
[11:23:44] <TinoDidriksen> Member function pointers are often twice the size of non-member function pointers.
[11:25:21] <KillAnimals> I'm just wondering if you can do it? I have a set of function pointers in my class, and I want to assign them in the constructor from one of two different classes.
[11:26:02] <TinoDidriksen> << sizeof(void*), sizeof(&foo), sizeof(&S::bar); void foo() {}; struct S { void bar() {} };
[11:26:02] <geordi> 8, 8, 16
[11:26:40] <TinoDidriksen> << TYPE(&foo), TYPE(&S::bar); void foo() {}; struct S { void bar() {} };
[11:26:40] <geordi> prvalue void (*)(), prvalue void (S::*)()
[11:26:54] <KillAnimals> interesting.
[11:27:37] <KillAnimals> I'm assuming that 16, 8 points to the class, and another 8 points to the function.
[11:28:03] <TinoDidriksen> Very likely
[11:28:27] <LordKalma> surprisingly high attendance in here
[11:28:41] *** Joins: JohnMS_WORK (~kvirc@213.134.183.29)
[11:29:04] <TinoDidriksen> So you can store member function pointers if you match the type, but can't store them as if they were non-member function pointers.
[11:29:44] *** Joins: Ronalds_Mazitis_ (~Ronalds_M@46.109.76.104)
[11:30:06] <KillAnimals> TinoDidriksen: Do I have to specify the type when I declare them?
[11:30:53] <KillAnimals> The member function pointer is going to be from either `class Foo;` or `class Bar;`
[11:32:24] <TinoDidriksen> I'm sure there are ways, but I don't know them. Probably std::function can do it? Or use a common base class. But it's kinda odd to even want to store such disparate member functions. How are you calling them again?
[11:34:51] <KillAnimals> TinoDidriksen: They are qt signals. So I am emitting them. The usecase is fairly straightforward to imagine. Its a card game. Cards are organized into lists. The list is either owned by the player, such as his hand, or the list is owned by the game, such as the trash, meaning it is shared by all players.
[11:35:09] <KillAnimals> When the list changes, it needs to emit the relevant signal.
[11:36:45] <KillAnimals> so, trash a card, "Game::trashChanged()" or pick up a card "Player::handChanged()".
[11:38:23] <TinoDidriksen> In my head that would mean a CardList with a Change event, and each Player has a CardList and subcribe to the Change event and then subsequently fire its own handChanged if needed.
[11:38:54] <LordKalma> if you're using Qt signals I don't see the need to ever store function pointers
[11:39:21] <KillAnimals> TinoDidriksen: If I understand right, that seems pretty close to what I am doing.
[11:40:41] <TinoDidriksen> But indeed, Qt signals should be able to just do this as long as the signatures match.
[11:40:44] <KillAnimals> LordKalma: I think I have found a usecase. In order to track the location of the card, the card has a union which tracks which list it belongs to. When it leaves a particular list, it has to emit signals.
[11:41:21] <TinoDidriksen> A card knows where it is? That's weird.
[11:41:32] <KillAnimals> TinoDidriksen: Yep it is weird.
[11:43:55] <LordKalma> I still don't see why you'd need to store function pointers
[11:44:08] <KillAnimals> Its a fun kind of weird. I think I did it to ensure that a card would never be able to belong to two lists simultaneously. I can't remember exactly how I came to the decision but I'm guessing that was the thrust of it
[11:44:11] <LordKalma> signals are supposed to be, like, just emit them and let the receivers worry about it
[11:44:42] <TinoDidriksen> If cards somehow ended up duplicated, there are bigger problems to solve.
[11:45:29] <TinoDidriksen> Working around ownership issues with a parent pointer in the owned object is the wrong solution.
[11:45:34] <very_sneaky> wouldn't Qt slots be storing function pointers some how?
[11:45:43] <LordKalma> yes
[11:45:46] <very_sneaky> as a callback to the signal
[11:45:48] <LordKalma> but that should be your problem
[11:45:53] <LordKalma> shouldn't*
[11:46:10] <TinoDidriksen> The QObject machinery takes care of that.

[11:52:51] <TinoDidriksen> That's semantically still wrong. Cards don't have agency.

[12:02:17] <KillAnimals> Also; From the players perspective; how is he supposed to who is considered the player and the opponent in the game?

[15:12:33] <PJBoy> honestly I can't with sed
[15:12:53] <johnny> although it was only 2 weeks ago that i learned that sed can edit lines that happen before that match (gnu sed only probably)
[15:13:06] <johnny> huh? sed is pretty easy to use
[15:13:17] <johnny> and there are tons of searchable oneliners
[15:13:25] <PJBoy> put it down to a lack of experience
[15:13:37] <johnny> most of the time if it's complicated at all i just look it up
[15:14:19] <johnny> like that match a pattern and then delete 2 lines before. i used to delete like 100 useless constructors across 6 files
[15:14:32] <PJBoy> I find grep annoying sometimes because of the confusing escape sequences

[15:15:30] <m_ben> PJBoy: great tutorial on sed: https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html
[15:15:35] <johnny> that way you don't have to worry about escaping backslashes
[15:15:40] <johnny> err forward slashes
[15:15:47] <PJBoy> ok sed shouldn't need a tutorial
[15:15:58] <johnny> why not. it does an amazing amount of stuff
[15:15:58] <m_ben> it's complicated :)
[15:16:11] <johnny> if you just want simple s/r then youdn't really need a tutorial
[15:16:15] <PJBoy> fair fair
[15:16:28] <PJBoy> and simple usage is all I'd ever want
[15:16:55] <PJBoy> using pipe as delimiter is a good tip
[15:17:11] <johnny> this is not something i could have even imagined sed could do: sed -i -s 'N;/Instruction.*nullptr/!P;D' headers/*InstructionsSet.h
[15:17:22] <PJBoy> now that the article mentions is, I've seen colon as the delimiter too
[15:17:24] <PJBoy> huh
[15:17:40] <PJBoy> anyways thanks for the link m_ben
[15:18:15] <johnny> match Instruction to nullptr (had to mak sure it only matched that consturctor, and then delete the 2 previous lines .. magic
[15:18:28] <johnny> err the match and the previous line rather
[15:18:57] <johnny> i could not find an IDE way of doing that in clion
[15:19:20] <johnny> of course clion has been nothin but dog slow so i gave up trying

[15:23:47] <m_ben> PJBoy: you can use _any_ character as delimiter. if you work with paths, you need something like #, for example sed "s/^$HOME/~/" won't work because $HOME has forward slashes, so you need to use something like sed "s#^HOME#~#", instead of # you can use anything else as long as the character is not contained in the pattern

[22:37:39] <PJBoy> template catch, bahaha

[22:39:42] <PJBoy> yeah, your stack unwinder would have no idea what to do
[22:39:54] <InPhase> Right...
[22:40:14] <LiaoTao> Phew. For a second there I thought the list of dumb things you have to explain to people had grown.
[22:40:36] <rpav> InPhase: oh, it's not possible, i'm just proposing things that are almost certainly useless but look maybe like they might do something
[22:40:54] <PJBoy> and the proof of the pudding was right here :D
[22:41:41] <InPhase> I mean you could implement it, but it would require some excessively dynamic handling unlike the rest of C++, and would leak into every exception throw program-wide.
[22:42:02] <rpav> like, "<T> class C { .. { try { .. } template<typename = enable_if_t<Type_A_Throws>> catch(T ..) {} template<...> ... } };"
[22:42:11] <InPhase> Or, it would require some deep inspection at link time.

[22:42:30] <rpav> err, but with proper enable_if etc etc

[22:44:36] <Alipha> rpav: why would you want to sfinae a catch? just put in the catch and if it catches something, it catches something.
