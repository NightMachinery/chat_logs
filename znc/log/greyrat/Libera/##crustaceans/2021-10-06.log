[00:00:23] <gwozniak> The way the women's lib movement plays in was a nice surprise, I thought
[00:01:32] <gwozniak> But some of the stuff they do is not all that realistic. Then again, it's a TV show, so I'm not expecting total realism
[00:02:44] <manicennui> In the future, we will launch people into space for TV shows.
[00:03:02] <gwozniak> That would not surprise me
[00:03:38] <gwozniak> Apparently Shatner is going to be on a Blue Orbit (or whatever the Bezos dildo is called) flight in the near future
[00:04:18] <manicennui> He should call it the Blue Pill.
[00:06:46] <Brekkjern> Or the Blue Balls considering you don't really get into orbit...
[00:06:56] <Brekkjern> You stop juuuuust before the finish line
[00:07:09] <dimadima> manicennui: nice
[00:07:24] <dimadima> Brekkjern: also nice lol
[00:07:49] <dimadima> it's incredible the spacex mission is going to be 3 days
[00:08:21] <dimadima> i'm not sure i could handle 3 days in orbit. how do you sleep?
[00:09:39] <Brekkjern> I'm pretty sure I'd become exhausted from the adrenaline rush at some point and sleep
[00:09:58] <Brekkjern> I've heard it's rather easy to sleep as any position is comfortable
[00:10:10] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: in a sleeping bag floating around but strapped to the wall
[00:10:25] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:10:41] <Brekkjern> And with a fan pointing at you so you don't suffocate from the CO2 buildup around your face
[00:10:44] <ngoldbaum> being in zero g makes a small space feel a lot bigger
[00:11:05] <ngoldbaum> yeah i’m sure their continually recirculating the air in the capsule
[00:11:10] <dimadima> i didn't mean the mechanics of it so much as i can't imaging closing my eyes after being launched into orbit
[00:11:38] <dimadima> but i guess yeah what Brekkjern describes sounds right
[00:11:44] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: They absolutely do, but the air you expel doesn't rise due to thermal differences, so unless there already is movement in the air you can end up in a CO2 pocket
[00:12:14] <Brekkjern> I doubt the risk of dying is high, but I can imagine waking up with a headache
[00:12:32] <ngoldbaum> you don’t need gravity to set up air currents so that doesn’t happen though
[00:12:42] <Brekkjern> Sure

[00:26:07] <dimadima> tf
[00:27:01] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Republicans see that and think, "Those kids are so resourceful! We need to do something to protect gun rights."
[00:27:43] <manicennui> Did you see that Alex Jones lost his defamation case?
[00:28:03] <manicennui> https://www.npr.org/2021/10/01/1042423742/alex-jones-sandy-hook-hoax-conspiracy
[00:28:03] <buttsbot> NPR Cookie Consent and Choices
[00:28:07] <dimadima> arm the kids
[00:28:15] <manicennui> A Texas judge has found Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones liable for damages in three defamation lawsuits brought by the parents of two children killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre over his claims that the shooting was a hoax.
[00:28:39] <manicennui> dimadima: That is exactly what many Republicans think the solution is: more guns for teachers and possibly students.
[00:28:41] <dimadima> manicennui: awesome. didn't see that
[00:29:13] <dimadima> manicennui: yeah i know :/ i was jokings (or not? i'm sure some would say it's a good idea) extending it down to the kids
[00:29:20] <Brekkjern> Honestly, the problem the US has isn't what kinds of guns people can get hold of, but rather the way you go about getting them and storing them :S
[00:29:39] <deadk> i think the main problem the US has is all the Americans
[00:29:48] <manicennui> I think we just have too many assholes who hate other people and see violence as a valid solution to problems.
[00:30:13] <Brekkjern> I can get an AR15 and 60 round mags in Norway. Trick it out with laser sights, foregrips, suppressors, red dots... What have you. No problem.
[00:30:36] <Brekkjern> It just takes me about a year of active participation in a shooting club to get it, and I must store it in a safe...
[00:31:12] <Brekkjern> It's not enough to just "pass a background check"
[00:31:14] <manicennui> What if the gun feels lonely in there?
[00:31:24] <manicennui> Background checks are almost meaningless.
[00:31:36] <Brekkjern> Well, you could get a handgun, shotgun, SBR, sniper rifle or whatever to keep it company...
[00:31:39] <manicennui> Plenty of people who kill with guns can pass a background check.
[00:31:58] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Yeah, but guns want to be Freedumb-lovin' Americans.
[00:32:01] <deadk> Brekkjern: iirc you need to have a reason to buy pretty much any gun in norway
[00:32:03] <manicennui> be ner
[00:32:04] <manicennui> near
[00:32:17] <Brekkjern> deadk: Yeah. Sports shooting is a valid reason. Hunting is another.
[00:32:20] *** Quits: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:33:44] <dimadima> i do agree with Brekkjern. it's weird you need a drivers license but you don't need a gun license
[00:34:02] <dimadima> 1 year in gun club seems a great way to do it
[00:34:02] <manicennui> Drivers licenses are also much easier to get in the US.
[00:34:08] <dimadima> people can socially identify the lunaitcs
[00:34:45] <manicennui> dimadima: I think we can already identify those people. The problem is that there is no law which prevents them from owning weapons.
[00:35:02] <Brekkjern> Funny thing about the gun clubs in Norway is that (according to a friend of mine who's active) they are mostly rather leftist. It's a really different culture compared to the US.
[00:35:04] <dimadima> manicennui: is that really the case though
[00:35:18] <dimadima> manicennui: that kid who shot up the school in florida. nikolas cruz
[00:35:28] <manicennui> dimadima: He didn't buy the gun, did he?
[00:35:29] <dimadima> so many cases ppl are clean on paper
[00:35:33] <dimadima> manicennui: i thin khe did?
[00:35:58] <dimadima> could be wrong for sure
[00:36:08] <dimadima> Brekkjern: how's gun violence in norway?
[00:36:13] <manicennui> dimadima: Also, most shootings in the US are not mass shootings.
[00:36:26] <manicennui> There are as many people shot in Chicago over most weekends as a mass shooting.
[00:36:28] <dimadima> yeah thats true
[00:36:44] <Brekkjern> dimadima: Practically unheard of, except for a mass shooting in 2011
[00:37:02] <deadk> i don't remember if the US's rate of gun homicide equals that of the rest of the world combined, but iirc it's pretty close
[00:37:04] <dimadima> maybe ppl in norway a much more stabl
[00:37:20] <deadk> there are crazy people everywhere, it's just not quite as easy for them to get guns
[00:37:36] <dimadima> so norway just does a remarkable job keeping guns out of peple's hands who will kill them
[00:37:39] <dimadima> ?
[00:37:49] <deadk> it's more like the USA does a remarkably bad job
[00:37:58] <manicennui> deadk: I don't think the rest of the world is even trying!
[00:37:59] <Brekkjern> Well... There was another attempted mass shooting a few years back
[00:38:12] <Brekkjern> And there are shootings every now and then, but it's rare
[00:38:31] <Brekkjern> There was one yesterday I think, and it's national news.
[00:39:42] <deadk> norway's homicide rate is very low anyway, so its gun homicide rate is going to be lower than that
[00:39:42] <manicennui> dimadima: Seems there was pretty extensive proof that Nikolas Cruz was unstable.

[00:40:17] <buttsbot> Stoneman Douglas High School shooting - Wikipedia
[00:41:43] <manicennui> dimadima: Seems Florida actually raised the minimum age to purchase rifles and added other restrictions. They also "provided a program for the arming of some school employees and hiring of school police".
[00:42:02] *** Joins: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat)
[00:44:38] <manicennui> That was signed into law under the previous governor.
[00:44:46] <manicennui> Doubt DeSantis would have signed it.
[00:45:03] <manicennui> DeSantis would probably sign a bill requiring no restrictions to gun purchases ever.
[00:46:32] <Brekkjern> From the outside it feels like the US is becoming more and more like something out of Mad Max, and of course you need guns to defend yourself in that kind of situation, so the pro-gun lobby seems positively prescient in that situation
[00:46:37] <ngoldbaum> don’t worry the supreme court will take care of that for him
[00:47:17] <manicennui> Brekkjern: The entire threat comes from the people who want the guns though.
[00:47:42] <manicennui> Frankly, it isn't that bad though.
[00:47:49] <Brekkjern> Yes, but they need it because it's a Mad Max world out there!
[00:47:54] <manicennui> Just makes for good news.
[00:48:03] <dimadima> manicennui: yeah cruz had an extensive record of instability. did it say he bought the weapon?
[00:48:03] <Brekkjern> Of course
[00:48:05] <manicennui> Not that our homicide rate isn't bad.
[00:48:13] <dimadima> or weapons? i think he had two
[00:48:21] <manicennui> But it's not something most of us worry about day to day.
[00:48:36] <manicennui> dimadima: Couldn't find the information on wikipedia.
[00:48:53] <dimadima> i kind of worry about getting randomly killed, no matter how unlikely that is
[00:49:14] <manicennui> I'm more worried about being killed by someone in a car.
[00:49:21] <dimadima> yeah car is one of them
[00:49:26] <deadk> not much point worrying about it
[00:49:27] <dimadima> i got like 55 in the left lane
[00:49:45] <dimadima> erm right lane lol
[00:49:47] <manicennui> dimadima: I mean, you are asking to be killed.
[00:49:48] <manicennui> hah
[00:49:51] <manicennui> Okay.
[00:50:10] <dimadima> i was starting to type "s/got/go" when i saw the bigger problem with that statement
[00:50:11] <manicennui> But even going the speed limit in the US is generally going too slow.
[00:50:26] <deadk> the US does have some weirdly low speed limits
[00:50:26] <dimadima> yah i mean realistically i go like 65 :)
[00:50:37] <manicennui> People would ride my ass on windy low speed roads in NC.
[00:51:23] <manicennui> Couldn't see what was ahead, but let's test our tires' grip!
[00:52:09] <dimadima> if it was up to me i'd make stoned driving legal and even encourage it
[00:52:18] <deadk> please no
[00:52:36] <deadk> manicennui: driving fast on windy roads is a lot of fun
[00:52:46] <dimadima> drunk driving is horrible but i've never seen a stoned driver drive worse than when they're not stoned
[00:52:47] <manicennui> I assume you mean because some stoned people drive slowly, but their reaction times are also affected, so no, let's not do that.
[00:52:55] <manicennui> deadk: Dying isn't.
[00:53:05] <deadk> yes, but driving fast without dying is possible
[00:53:20] <manicennui> Many things are possible.
[00:53:21] <deadk> in particular i feel that all normal cars should come with a button that vaporizes any caravans on the road ahead
[00:53:29] <manicennui> I rather not increase my chances unnecessarily.
[00:54:38] <deadk> if you don't want to increase your chances unnecessarily you should probably just avoid those windy roads altogether
[00:54:58] <manicennui> Why not drive on them at a safe speed?
[00:55:23] <deadk> there's no universally agreed-upon safe speed
[00:55:50] <manicennui> There are speed limits.
[00:55:53] <manicennui> We could start there.
[00:56:07] <deadk> well, you agree that they're too slow in some cases
[00:56:20] <manicennui> Yeah, on long stretches of very straight road.
[00:56:23] <manicennui> Like most US highways.
[00:56:27] <deadk> i realise that you're always objectively correct about everything, but the people driving behind you probably don't know that, and believe that the safe speed is faster than you're driving
[01:20:02] <manicennui> Are these warranty scams never going to end?
[01:20:06] <manicennui> Got two calls today.
[01:22:35] <dimadima> car warranty? no
[01:22:50] <dimadima> only good thing george w bush ever did -- the do no call registry -- went nowhere
[01:23:10] <manicennui> Is there an American out there who hasn't received dozens of these calls?
[01:23:15] <manicennui> Are people still being fooled?
[01:23:28] <dimadima> no but the government isn't capable of delivering on even the most basic conveniences we would enjoy
[01:24:16] <dimadima> they'll build roads cause there's graft in road-building. there's no graft in abolishing phone spam
[01:24:35] <manicennui> I just don't know why it is still worth it for the scammers. Must still be working.
[01:24:45] <dimadima> i feel sorry for people who need to pick up unknown calls
[01:24:56] <manicennui> I assume they'd have to move on to a new scam by now.
[01:24:57] <dimadima> must be, or people are desperate and try
[01:25:10] <dimadima> they leave me voicemails about my warranty
[01:31:29] <dimadima> it expired :(

[01:32:55] <dimadima> manicennui: as in illustrative example though: my wife was once at a dinner when a person who was with explaimed "oh no, my phone is out of storage. i guess i need to upgrade icloud again" and did so promptly
[01:33:05] <dimadima> manicennui: holy fuck that's miserable
[01:33:14] <manicennui> Didn't mean to include the search text.
[01:33:21] <dimadima> but that's so miserable :(
[01:34:25] <dimadima> what kind of exploitation is that? schoolshootingxploitation?
[01:35:03] <manicennui> It isn't.
[01:35:42] <manicennui> "Sandy Hook Promise is a national nonprofit organization founded and led by several family members whose loved ones were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012."
[01:36:32] <manicennui> On the one hand, I don't think you can get through to most Americans without something that shocking, but I also don't think you can get through to the ones that you need to with anything.
[01:37:11] <dimadima> you're saying because relatives were involved it's not exploitation?
[01:37:28] <manicennui> I don't think so.
[01:37:36] <manicennui> They are trying to raise awareness and do something.
[01:38:06] <manicennui> It's not like they are using their loss to get rich or something.
[01:38:36] <manicennui> By some technical definition of "exploit", I suppose you could call it that.
[01:39:24] <manicennui> 2: to make use of meanly or unfairly for one's own advantage
[01:39:36] <manicennui> I don't think they are doing that.
[01:39:39] <manicennui> 1: to make productive use of : UTILIZE
[01:39:55] <manicennui> They are probably doing that, but I think the way you are using it seems negative.
[01:39:56] <dimadima> relations being involved definitely makes me more hesitant to make sweeping, potentially insensitive statements, but i'm inclined to think that relatives of shooting victims are ripe for exploitation by people
[01:40:01] <dimadima> secondary exploitation
[01:41:18] <dimadima> i like how the only way to test a production payments integration is with real money
[01:41:18] <manicennui> I think they are trying to make positive changes.
[01:41:23] <manicennui> I also think that they shouldn't have to.
[01:42:01] <manicennui> But our legislators have shown that no number of dead children will lead to action.
[01:42:11] <manicennui> At least nothing substantial.
[01:42:27] <manicennui> And they certainly don't care about dead adults.

[01:43:39] <manicennui> Not sure why the title is different from the article.
[01:44:32] <manicennui> Weekend before: 10 killed, 58 wounded by gunfire in Chicago over weekend
[01:45:24] <manicennui> We have had a big uptick in murders this year.
[01:45:44] <manicennui> And a lot of carjacking murders happening in front of multiple witnesses.
[01:45:46] <dimadima> what do you think can be done in the near term to address this
[01:46:08] <manicennui> I think the mayor has the option of asking for federal help.
[01:46:20] <dimadima> hasn't she? what would the feds do

[01:46:36] <buttsbot> Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot asks Biden for help after bloody July 4 weekend
[01:46:50] <dimadima> cops of all varieties are mostly versed in brutality
[01:47:20] <dimadima> when i lived on the south side it seemed like there was this cycle of cops brutalizing ppl, ppl saying "keep cops out", massive violence, ppl saying "where are the cops"
[01:47:24] <manicennui> Seems like she is discussing it with them.
[01:47:30] <manicennui> I think she was against it for a long time.
[01:48:11] <manicennui> Yeah, I don't think there is a quick fix for the overall problem, but they can probably do something about the recent spike.
[01:48:12] <dimadima> whether the feds are run by trump or biden, what the do is what they did in portalnd
[01:48:23] <manicennui> There are also a lot of questionable decisions being made by the DA
[01:48:25] <dimadima> which is to disappear ppl and shit
[01:48:51] <manicennui> They just let released a bunch of people who were involved in a public shootout without charging them.
[01:49:06] <manicennui> Yeah, I can understand the hesitancy.
[01:49:06] <dimadima> yeah that happens now all the time in new york
[01:50:30] <manicennui> During a budget meeting with aldermen Monday, police acknowledged that, despite being caught on a city POD camera, the shooting was between what are being called "mutual combatants" and that it's hard to discern who fired first and who might have been acting in self-defense.
[01:51:02] <manicennui> She is claiming lack of evidence apparently.
[01:51:16] <manicennui> Who knows.
[01:51:49] <manicennui> The fundamental problems can't really be solved by Chicago nor the state because both are already fucked financially.
[01:52:15] <manicennui> And would probably take a generation or two to really have an impact.
[01:53:11] <manicennui> Same fundamental problems that exist everywhere in the US.
[01:56:46] <manicennui> Between the cold weather and covid cases possibly dying down, the spike in gun crime might end soon anyways.
[01:57:04] <manicennui> Then we'll just have the normal ridiculous level of gun crime.

[18:04:04] <imode> I actually streamed on twitch at one point.
[18:04:07] <companion_cube> lottery is a tax on the uneducated :/
[18:04:12] <imode> was top programming stream for a hot minue.
[18:04:15] <imode> *minute.
[18:04:17] <dimadima> yeah lottery and casinos :(
[18:04:36] <dimadima> very cool, i could never do that
[18:04:50] <imode> it was difficult but rewarding.
[18:05:05] <companion_cube> there's at least the Zig guy on twitch
[18:05:10] <companion_cube> it's nice to follow from time to time
[18:05:30] <cot> the secret hitler streaming was neat
[18:05:31] <imode> it was a freeform format where people could drop in and ask for programming help, or ask for something to be covered.

[18:06:55] <dimadima> content security policy
[18:06:58] <ngoldbaum> cython has plenty of weirdness at the edges
[18:07:52] <imode> someone wanted to add some kind of static array type to the interpreter but didn't know the specifics. it was a gateway for me to talk about interpreters in general, as well as build one on-stream.
[18:08:13] <dimadima> why'd you stop
[18:08:20] <imode> mental drain and lack of income.
[18:08:38] <dimadima> heh yeah those are my two general limiting factors in life as well
[18:09:05] <imode> have considered going back, but it'd have to be incredibly sparse, and I mean.. not on twich.
[18:09:26] <dimadima> so twitch is, like most of these platforms, a Bad Place (TM)?
[18:09:33] <imode> yeah.
[18:09:53] <imode> you can find a niche hole in it somewhere, but on the whole it's not a good place.
[18:09:55] <dimadima> what's their deal? encouraging "engagement"?
[18:09:57] <cot> I guessit depends on what corner you're in
[18:10:20] <imode> their deal is that they're actively hostile to their end users and in some cases their streamers.
[18:10:27] <imode> their partner/affiliate program is uh.
[18:10:30] <imode> interesting.
[18:10:36] <cot> Oh?
[18:10:38] <imode> yeah.
[18:10:45] <dimadima> how are they hostile?
[18:10:54] <dimadima> or uh do any examples come to mind
[18:11:31] <imode> from flat out lying to their userbase about who gets what rewards to manufacturing drama for views via bans to selectively enforcing rules for some streamers but not for others.
[18:12:18] <imode> to the very uh.. let's call it inconsistent views on viewer morality in the face of nudity and violence.
[18:12:19] <dimadima> they give users rewards for consuming?
[18:12:22] <imode> yeah.
[18:12:35] <imode> the whole concept of "loot" is/was fucked.
[18:12:43] <dimadima> oh that's from them?
[18:12:46] <imode> yup.
[18:12:48] <dimadima> wow
[18:12:51] <dimadima> didnt know that
[18:13:12] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: they want people to buy emotes and other mocrotransactions
[18:13:24] <dimadima> i've seriously been living under a rock. few days ago there was a post on HN how the "hermit programmer is dead" or something and i was like "uhh excuse me"

[18:14:54] <buttsbot> Hacker News
[18:15:00] <ngoldbaum> (needs showdead on)
[18:15:12] <dimadima> i think it was someone who doesn't actually program or knew what he was talking about
[18:15:25] <dimadima> TL;DR software is big now and you need lots of people to execute it
[18:15:49] <imode> IMO that's really unfortunate and something I wanna fight back on.
[18:16:05] <imode> I'm a hermit programmer.
[18:16:06] <dimadima> lots of pushback in the comments fwiw
[18:16:39] <dimadima> uh me too. i've had to learn a lot to make it happen, but if anything i think the technologies that have come up in recent times have only enabled the hermit programmer to achieve way more
[18:16:46] <imode> small software is worth the inverse of its weight in gold.
[18:16:58] <dimadima> well, that too
[18:17:10] <dimadima> but if you need to manage complexity, it's never been easier imo
[18:17:22] <dimadima> it's much easier today than even 5 years ago
[18:17:50] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: [flagged] now
[18:18:06] <imode> that I agree with, the problem is that once it gets easier to "manage" complexity, the easier it is to complect things.
[18:18:26] <imode> so that anybody outside your bubble that isn't using the tools you are suddenly can't read what you read.
[18:18:37] <imode> case in point, heavy reliance on IDE usage.
[18:18:42] <dimadima> for sure. for me it's awlays a cycle if expanding and reducing
[18:19:10] <dimadima> imode: well fwiw i think the tools do the opposite! tons of ppl know kubernetes now
[18:19:29] <dimadima> and if they don't know it, they can learn it pretty quickly, at least the user end if it
[18:19:40] <dimadima> many common "languages" have emerged that people can all speak together
[18:19:42] <imode> I have thoughts about kube and they aren't positive.
[18:19:47] <dimadima> hehehe
[18:19:55] <dimadima> i thought might be the case
[18:20:02] * manicennui remains blissfully ignorant.
[18:20:04] <dimadima> for me it's been super enabling, at the expense of using k8s
[18:20:12] <gwozniak> As a user k8s drives me crazy
[18:20:23] <dimadima> gwozniak: anything in paricular?
[18:20:48] <imode> one of my first introductions to kubernetes was the "space shuttle" code segment.
[18:20:50] <gwozniak> Just the fact that I now have to assign resources (memory, cpu) manually
[18:21:11] <dimadima> imode: not familiar with that
[18:21:22] <companion_cube> "… facilitates deploying and updating, in minutes, very complex software architectures using a single human-readable YAML file."
[18:21:25] <companion_cube> how about no? :D
[18:21:26] <dimadima> gwozniak: ah yeah that can be annoyin

[18:21:50] <dimadima> lololol
[18:21:59] <dimadima> that's incredible
[18:22:16] <dimadima> i think i have actually seen that
[18:22:31] <imode> the organizational model behind kubernetes sucks, imo.
[18:22:42] <ngoldbaum> devops is software engineering but the only language you can use is yaml
[18:22:45] <ngoldbaum> good luck!
[18:23:05] <imode> I'll take "visions of agony" for 300, alex.
[18:23:05] <ngoldbaum> bash quoted as strings inside the yaml is ok though
[18:23:28] <imode> the problem is nobody is trying anything else. this is another problem with large software.
[18:23:42] <dimadima> yeah the yaml kind of suck, the quoted bash kind of sucks, but the benefits for me as a lone dev have been so great
[18:24:28] <dimadima> probably stuff i can do by other means, but it does what i need and has reduced my cognitive ops load a lot
[18:24:33] <manicennui> The problem is that most of the people claiming everyone should use this or that solution have never used anything else, and don't have the problems that these solutions were designed for.
[18:24:54] <dimadima> this is true. before k8s i only used VMs wher ei installed things manually and used systemd
[18:25:03] <dimadima> i never used ansible or other things from that era
[18:25:10] <dimadima> so i definitely don't know
[18:25:10] <imode> when a solution does _what you want_, and is popular, you hit this "artifact lock" where you use the thing despite its massive complexity and/or bugs, and anybody that wants to compete with that has to build all the way up to that level again _at once_ instead of building smaller solutions that can be pieced together.
[18:25:42] <imode> so too it is with browsers.
[18:25:47] <imode> which is why everything is webkit.
[18:25:48] <manicennui> I think people far overestimate how much all of this stuff is used too.
[18:26:00] <dimadima> what stuff
[18:26:07] <manicennui> Any of the hyped stuff.
[18:26:08] <dimadima> imode: fwiw, it's now blink
[18:26:13] <imode> yeah..
[18:26:16] <dimadima> :)
[18:26:16] <imode> I can't keep up.
[18:26:20] <dimadima> hehehe
[18:26:21] <manicennui> Most shit that you depend is using crap you'd probably claim is "old".
[18:26:44] <imode> people wonder why I lose myself in esolangs.
[18:26:52] <imode> and forth.
[18:26:55] <dimadima> i just really like how for each pod kubernetes assigns a unique IP, for example
[18:27:02] <dimadima> so you don't have to think abour ports
[18:27:08] <manicennui> imode: Yeah, that is actually one of the reasons I want to move away from more popular languages.
[18:27:09] <dimadima> i also really like how it manages state and volumes
[18:27:35] <imode> manicennui: come join me in BF-like land, where I build a fantasy console out of toothpicks and snot.
[18:28:00] <manicennui> BF?
[18:28:03] <imode> brainfuck.
[18:28:06] <manicennui> Ah.
[18:28:25] <manicennui> I've more or less settled on another category of languages that offend most people: lisps.
[18:28:36] <imode> lisps are lit.
[18:29:05] <manicennui> They even offend people who are into FP because most of them don't have static typing!
[18:29:14] <manicennui> It's great.
[18:29:26] <companion_cube> alternatively you can use normal languages, and do esoteric projects with them
[18:29:58] <manicennui> See, companion_cube is offended.
[18:29:59] <imode> I have a tiny language that manipulates a deque of bits (not bytes/words, bits), has six commands. very much leaning towards a lisp that compiles down to it instead of a forthy thing.
[18:30:26] <imode> I kinda built something of it in Python.

[18:30:47] <companion_cube> manicennui: I wasn't writing that in reaction to you, sorry :D
[18:30:55] <manicennui> companion_cube: heh
[18:31:58] <imode> lisp evangelism is the stuff that gets me up in the morning.
[18:32:07] * manicennui wants to write lisp sci-fi
[18:32:09] <companion_cube> to each their kinks
[18:32:20] <manicennui> In a future where lisp is the dominant language...
[18:32:25] <Geekingfrog> :D
[18:32:27] <manicennui> And the average person knows a bit of it
[18:32:30] * Geekingfrog would read that
[18:32:41] <imode> clojure imo interests me the most.
[18:32:43] <companion_cube> I kind of wish I had a lisp syntax for OCaml
[18:32:51] <companion_cube> but just the syntax
[18:33:00] <manicennui> imode: yeah, Clojure is a decent path to making a living.
[18:33:25] <imode> hickey's talks about clojure's design philosophy resonate with me.
[18:33:25] <manicennui> I learned that Grammarly uses CL in prod recently.
[18:33:31] <imode> oh sick.
[18:33:49] <manicennui> imode: Yeah, he is great. I find the Clojure community in general to be very pragmatic and thoughtful.
[18:33:59] <Geekingfrog> ^ same
[18:34:05] <manicennui> https://www.grammarly.com/blog/engineering/running-lisp-in-production/
[18:34:11] <imode> ayyy.
[18:34:16] <Geekingfrog> although there are a few things in Hickey's talk that are a bit "uuuuh, wat?"
[18:34:24] <companion_cube> :-°
[18:34:32] <imode> Geekingfrog: do tell! I probably missed them.
[18:34:40] <companion_cube> at least in the "maybe not" talk
[18:34:53] * manicennui knew companion_cube would have a problem with that talk.
[18:34:58] <companion_cube> of course
[18:35:13] <companion_cube> but a lot of it is probably that Hickey and I write very different kinds of programs
[18:35:23] <Geekingfrog> It's been a while, but yeah, the "maybe not" one, was off the mark. I think it was a lot about how names aren't what he'd expect
[18:35:36] <imode> is that the one where he goes into RDF data modeling.
[18:35:52] <imode> also damn grammarly is more lisp than I imagined.
[18:36:07] <Geekingfrog> can't remember that bit :(
[18:36:56] <companion_cube> it's the one where he talks shit about ML/Haskell :op
[18:36:58] <companion_cube> :p
[18:37:14] <imode> oh joy.
[18:37:32] <imode> there are things I can say about haskell, but I wouldn't shit on it.
[18:37:34] <ngoldbaum> :op is for people who have large noses
[18:37:36] * manicennui prepares to talk for an hour straight
[18:38:00] <imode> ..though the fact that every program contains a memory leak is funny to me.
[18:38:02] <ngoldbaum> maybe i’m just not a lisper but i find haskell incomprehensible and overly magic
[18:38:10] <companion_cube> he doesn't shit on it, but he has a few misconceptions on how sum types are used, imho
[18:38:25] <imode> types are the thing that haskell gets right!
[18:38:36] <companion_cube> clearly
[18:39:02] <imode> dependent typing is where is at if you want to lock up your typechecker, though.
[18:39:17] <imode> and perl is where it's at if you want to cause he parser to lock up.
[18:39:25] <imode> *the parser
[18:39:47] <manicennui> I bet there are still people out there writing Perl for a living.
[18:40:04] <manicennui> Happy that no one is trying to sell them the latest fad every 6 months.
[18:40:12] <imode> my manager wrote perl last month!
[18:41:39] <companion_cube> the future of Haskell is Idris
[18:43:17] <imode> I forget what the corresponding logic is for dependent types.
[18:43:59] <imode> oh it's first-order.
[18:44:27] <imode> no wonder.
[18:46:59] <companion_cube> only intuitionistic first-order though
[18:47:01] <companion_cube> boo
[18:47:25] <imode> don't worry, it's still undecidable. ;)

[19:01:01] <Xe> that's not wrong
[19:01:08] <imode> what would be the lisp? :P
[19:01:12] <cot> english would be the javascript

[19:02:33] <cot> latin can have many different orderings iirc
[19:02:37] <cot> idk about sanskrit
[19:03:05] <Xe> you can modify the default order in lojban using the selma'o FA
[19:03:37] <cot> Wait, lojban has indicator-words that can specify or modify default grammar?
[19:03:55] <Xe> yes
[19:04:07] <Xe> in fact there are only two types of words

[19:07:05] * manicennui watches his coworkers struggle with basic shit.
[19:07:27] <manicennui> They use this fucking make file to do things, and they still don't seem to understand that it is sshing to the actual machine to do it.
[19:07:44] <manicennui> So they were trying to install gems locally and then wondering why things weren't working on the actual box.
[19:08:02] <cot> Wow.
[19:08:07] <Geekingfrog> oÔ
[19:08:22] <companion_cube> I wonder if gemini people would like lobjan
[19:08:25] <manicennui> They all use this makefile, and none of them understand what it does.
[19:08:35] <Geekingfrog> did they ever read it?
[19:08:36] <cot> companion_cube: too complex!
[19:08:40] <companion_cube> clearly, writing a gemlog in a minimalistic, one-weekend language is the graal
[19:08:54] <manicennui> Geekingfrog: Whenever they have a problem with it, I find the problem in the makefile and direct them to it, but no, I don't think so.
[19:09:12] <manicennui> I also don't use that bullshit, so it always takes me a bit to figure out wtf they are doing.
[19:09:19] <manicennui> Just ssh into the damn machine and type commands.
[19:09:26] <companion_cube> ssh commands in a makefile is a bit of a trick though
[19:09:40] <cot> Why not put the makefile on the remote box.
[19:10:00] <manicennui> cot: The whole point is that they can do everything locally I guess.
[19:10:10] <manicennui> And not have to think about what is actually happening.
[19:10:15] <manicennui> But it just makes them dumb.
[19:10:36] <cot> uhhuh
[19:10:48] <manicennui> To be clear, the commands are not just "make ls" or something.
[19:11:11] <cot> I think I see what you're saying, nvm
[19:11:15] <manicennui> They are the types of things you might want to setup alias for or whatever.
[19:12:29] <companion_cube> I have some rsync in makefiles
[19:12:31] <companion_cube> but ssh, ouch
[19:13:50] <manicennui> It only uses ssh because we can't run our app on bare metal Macs.
[19:14:02] <manicennui> So we run it on a Linux VM somewhere.
[19:14:16] <Geekingfrog> why not give linux machines to devs?
[19:14:16] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[19:14:27] <manicennui> The commands are a bunch of random common things that people do while working on our app.
[19:14:38] <manicennui> Rebuilding the database, bringing up the Rails console, etc.
[19:14:58] <ngoldbaum> Geekingfrog: too hard to do enterprise IT provisioning, usually
[19:15:47] <companion_cube> sounds like I'd rather ssh to the machine, personally
[19:15:47] <imode> you have to request a linux machine at amazon.
[19:16:01] <manicennui> Geekingfrog: Because we aren't masochists.
[19:16:02] <Geekingfrog> yeah, we have similar shit going on here. But the IT policy is a joke for devs. Every single developer is in breach
[19:16:03] <companion_cube> at least you can? good
[19:16:23] <manicennui> We have a couple people with Linux laptops. They are on their own.
[19:16:32] <companion_cube> at the startup I work, I had to insist a bit to not get a mac :D
[19:16:38] <Geekingfrog> like, there is a list of whitelisted applications. No IDE is on the list
[19:16:47] <imode> lmfao what.
[19:16:48] <ngoldbaum> Geekingfrog: and that’s how your entire database and source code listing ends up on 4chan :p
[19:18:04] <Geekingfrog> How come?
[19:18:28] <companion_cube> I'm not in a hurry to see every company force their devs into some equivalent of github codespace
[19:18:33] <companion_cube> to keep the proprietary shit locked in
[19:19:19] <imode> can't wait until the upcoming security audit for amazon.

[19:50:59] <imode> what's the prognosis.
[19:51:01] <phil> It no longer gets updates from Google, so it gets the Debian.
[19:51:15] <phil> I mean, bricking is a perfectly possible outcome.
[19:51:43] <phil> I’m going to be running random shell scripts downloaded from the internet. What could possibly go wrong?
[19:52:04] <companion_cube> is it hard to install an OS on it?
[19:52:43] <imode> wasn't one of the selling points that it was easy to install *nix on it.
[19:52:43] <phil> If you want full control, in this case I have to open the thing up & unscrew the write protect screw on the boot flash
[19:52:58] <phil> Then I have to install a full UEFI bootloader.
[19:53:03] <imode> that's disgusting.
[19:53:04] * dimadima deploying CSP. hopes it doesn't break stuff

[19:53:38] <imode> oh good.
[19:53:42] <imode> that's at least an improvement.
[19:53:52] <dimadima> running shell scripts from the internet usually works
[19:53:54] <indigo> phil: Isn't it just coreboot + SeaBIOS?
[19:54:04] <dimadima> my fav is piping them through sudo
[19:54:33] <phil> Yup. But if you’re abandoning ChromeOS, then you’re better off installing the full UEFI bios from Tianocore/coreboot.
[19:54:47] <phil> Which I am, because Google has given up on this device.
[19:55:12] <phil> (apparently)
[19:56:02] <companion_cube> that sounds scary
[19:56:08] <phil> & the installed legacy bios has bugs.
[19:56:21] <imode> google gives up every other week.
[19:56:28] <phil> companion_cube: It’s that or throw it away & I hate junking perfectly good hardware.
[19:56:48] <phil>  Already had to junk a perfectly good phone this month because it no longer gets updates.
[19:56:54] <imode> they're an advertising company. their device/support cycles demand that everybody get the hot new thing so they can advertise to you more and collect new analytics.
[19:57:16] <indigo> phil: Gotcha. I'm a little out of the loop; I've done the same brain surgery many years ago but I don't think the UEFI bios was available

[21:10:31] <manicennui> I really hate flippers.
[21:10:52] <manicennui> For some reason you can always tell when a house was "fixed up" by flippers.
[21:11:17] <manicennui> And then you look at the sale history and your fears are confirmed.
[21:11:36] <companion_cube> how can you tell? bad quality work?
[21:11:42] <manicennui> Thanks for buying the house 6 months ago, throwing some cheap upgrades in, and raising the prices $100k!
[21:11:47] <manicennui> companion_cube: I don't know exactly.
[21:11:51] <manicennui> I always can though.
[21:11:55] <manicennui> They tend to look decent.
[21:11:59] <manicennui> But there is just something about them.
[21:12:13] <manicennui> This is an example: https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/7720-Tripp-Ave-Skokie-IL-60076/3546291_zpid/?
[21:12:14] <buttsbot> 7720 Tripp Ave, Skokie, IL 60076 | MLS #11229943 | Zillow
[21:12:32] <manicennui> And you can see that they bought it for $400k in January.
[21:12:35] <companion_cube> new windows? :D
[21:13:00] <manicennui> I think it's the tile that tips me off somehow.
[21:13:20] <dimadima> man that front looks like a kitchen backsplash
[21:13:33] <manicennui> The real problem is that if they are only asking for $110k over what they paid for it, but they have touched over half the rooms, then you know they did it as cheaply as possible.
[21:13:37] <dimadima> as does much of the interior
[21:13:57] <dimadima> yeah the cheaply as possible thing is what sucks
[21:14:15] <manicennui> All so they can make housing less affordable and make a buck!
[21:14:15] <dimadima> that's what sucks about flippers
[21:14:39] <dimadima> have you heard about how banks are buying houses in bulk these days
[21:14:45] <manicennui> I've heard Zillow is.
[21:14:56] <dimadima> yeah like zillow, banks are too
[21:15:08] <manicennui> At this point I feel like there is going to be another collapse.
[21:16:15] <companion_cube> if the speculators can collapse, sure
[21:16:31] <manicennui> I'm wondering whether they covered up the original brickwork with fake brick fascades.
[21:16:39] <manicennui> facades
[21:16:46] <manicennui> They are too perfect and perfectly matching.
[21:17:39] <manicennui> I also looked up the house on Google Maps and it doesn't look like that.
[21:18:34] <manicennui> The brick was red.
[21:18:40] <manicennui> There is no way they replaced it.
[21:18:45] <manicennui> It has to be a facade.
[21:18:55] <manicennui> Just terrible.
[21:20:02] <manicennui> Oh shit. Sold for $141,275 last January.
[21:20:20] <manicennui> Description claims it was gut rehabbed in December.
[21:20:27] <manicennui> So did someone buy it in January and now wants to leave already?
[21:23:21] <manicennui> Looks like it was a foreclosure originally.
[21:24:37] <kline> flips are the used-car salesmen of the property market
[21:25:24] <kline> max profit:spend, low risk, quick turnaround as sitting on the inventory kills the revenue
[21:25:58] <manicennui> They just add so much cost, making housing less affordable.
[21:26:08] <manicennui> This home over doubled in value.
[21:26:20] <kline> compared to the foreclosure price?
[21:26:40] <manicennui> It went from something that was affordable for lower middle class families to something that can only be afforded by upper middle class families.
[21:26:49] <kline> i get thats a big jump, but comparing an undervalued sale to an overvalued one is going to be unrepresentative anyway
[21:27:17] <manicennui> I doubt that foreclosure price was half of its market value.
[21:27:43] <manicennui> And I don't know what the current price bump is about.
[21:27:53] <manicennui> Does look like the flipper bought it as a foreclosure.
[21:28:59] <manicennui> Even if they aren't trying to be greedy, they basically have to sell it for quite a bit more than they paid and put into it to make it worth their while.
[21:29:26] <kline> if a house is 100k actual value and was sold at foreclosure with a 25% discount, and later sells at a 25% markup, thats 75k -> 125k
[21:29:48] <kline> not quite double, but in 2008 foreclosed housing was definitely going very cheap
[21:30:12] <kline> not sure what pattern exists in the us market just now
[21:30:58] <kline> the market here in the UK is definitely inflated just now as well, so flippers are loving life
[21:31:04] <manicennui> It was foreclosed on at the end of 2019 and sold in early 2020.
[21:31:49] <manicennui> Looks like the bank sold it to another bank for 142,500, and then that bank sold it to the flipper for 170,500.

[21:32:03] <buttsbot> UK House Price Index - Office for National Statistics
[21:32:08] <manicennui> And less than a year later someone bought it for $400k.
[21:32:09] <kline> see fig. 1 for how things have been here
[21:32:15] <manicennui> And now they are trying to sell it for over $500k.
[21:32:53] <kline> 13% jump in house prices as we exited the pandemic and still climbing
[21:33:20] <manicennui> Yeah, things are pretty fucked all over.
[21:33:36] <manicennui> I can't imagine making an average salary.
[21:33:41] <manicennui> And then having kids on top of that.
[21:34:30] <imode> I don't have kids and I can't even afford a house right now.
[21:34:32] <dimadima> manicennui:  are you moving to skokie :)
[21:34:41] <gwozniak> imode: similar here
[21:34:42] <manicennui> dimadima: Probably not.
[21:34:53] <manicennui> dimadima: If I had to move to the suburbs, that area is probably where I would move though.
[21:35:01] <manicennui> Was mostly curious what is available.
[21:35:08] <gwozniak> imode: and both me and my wife have decent salaries
[21:35:09] <manicennui> imode: Stop being poor.
[21:35:13] <imode> the market is more than likely going to keel over soon.
[21:35:23] <dimadima> btw gwozniak not to get on k8s again but you don't have to specify resource reqs if you don't want to. it's just that pods won't get scheduled across your cluster if you do not
[21:35:27] <imode> evergrande is still a developing situation.
[21:35:40] <dimadima> manicennui: i liked skokie/evanston/gencloe
[21:35:48] <dimadima> as far as suburbs go
[21:36:00] <manicennui> dimadima: Yeah, they are a bit better.
[21:36:04] <manicennui> Lot of good food.
[21:36:16] <manicennui> CTA even goes to Skokie and Evanston.
[21:36:17] <dimadima> metra north is nice too
[21:36:23] <dimadima> oh yeah and the purple line
[21:36:25] <manicennui> Evanston is kind of like Chicago lite.
[21:36:32] <dimadima> hahaha yeah good way to put it
[21:36:36] <gwozniak> dimadima: that's not what we are told here
[21:37:00] <dimadima> gwozniak: k8s linters will freak out at if you don't specify resources, but that's about it. maybe your cluster enforces it too, then?
[21:37:27] <gwozniak> and it sounds like if we don't specify resources, nothing good will come of it
[21:37:28] <dimadima> i'd be surprised if there wasn't a flag that required them
[21:37:36] <manicennui> "won't get scheduled across your cluster"
[21:37:42] <manicennui> Doesn't that mean they won't run?
[21:37:44] <dimadima> may end up on same machine
[21:38:14] <gwozniak> Our builds require a lot of resources, so it will surely fail
[21:38:15] <dimadima> but you can also specify affinities to avoid that
[21:38:19] <dimadima> yeah
[21:38:22] <dimadima> you're using this for builds?
[21:38:31] <gwozniak> yeah
[21:38:32] <dimadima> cool
[21:38:44] <gwozniak> Well, some builds.  Other builds don't
[21:39:26] <gwozniak> The fact that I have to trail and error my way to finding decent resource values is pretty obnoxious
[21:39:36] <gwozniak> I mean... that was the point of operating systems
[21:39:42] <gwozniak> Feels like a regression
[21:40:02] <gwozniak> I just maxed them out and forgot about it at this point
[21:40:10] <dimadima> yeah i've always had this same gripe but i just chalked it up to not knowing how ti figure out how much ram/cpu a service is using, per se
[21:40:15] <dimadima> and, shit, is there really even *a* way?
[21:40:55] <dimadima> i'm sure i'm missing something. but now that you're also having this confusion, maybe i'm not?
[21:41:52] <dimadima> i also considered that maybe some things are, actually, deduced by trial and error?
[21:42:13] <dimadima> but i doubt that's the case here
[21:42:34] <manicennui> I think we are a year or two away from someone creating something that simplifies all of this and gives people most of the same advantages.
[21:44:02] <gwozniak> I had to guess how much cpu, memory, and ephemeral-storage I wanted for my pod.yaml file.  Basically I ran a build and adjusted those values until I said, "fuck it, set to maximum"
[21:44:13] <gwozniak> (or almost maximium)
[21:44:27] <gwozniak> When your builds take multiple hours, this really, really sucks
[21:44:37] <dimadima> for something like a build that kind of makes sense though
[21:44:40] <dimadima> you do want the maximumum right
[21:44:46] <dimadima> k8s seems like a strange use-case for this
[21:44:58] <dimadima> erm, this seems like a strange use-case for k8s
[21:45:34] <dimadima> for long-running processes, you can watch them and track memory usage over-time. for builds you want max memory, max cpu?
[21:45:35] <manicennui> Not really.
[21:46:02] <manicennui> Mozilla uses a tool that does something similar using EC2.
[21:46:10] <manicennui> Or at least it did several years ago.
[21:46:28] <gwozniak> Sure, but sometimes they fail after, say, 1.5 hours because you ran out of memory
[21:46:47] <manicennui> Most CI pipelines use containers these days.
[21:47:04] <dimadima> right but gwozniak's builds aren't running on public ifnra?
[21:47:18] <dimadima> i guess they're shared internally?
[21:47:40] <manicennui> Why does that matter though?
[21:47:51] <dimadima> manicennui: well most builds that run on CI don't run out of memory and fail
[21:47:52] <gwozniak> Our stuff isn't public, but I'm told we use AWS for the machines
[21:48:00] <dimadima> if that's your build, you can't run it on public CI
[21:48:01] <manicennui> But I don't think the situation is any different with popular CI tools.
[21:48:10] <manicennui> I believe we have to specify which instances we want to use.
[21:48:33] <dimadima> gwozniak couldn't run these builds on public CI cause they'd fail?
[21:48:41] <manicennui> What do you mean by "public"?
[21:48:52] <dimadima> you can make an account and get access
[21:48:59] <dimadima> AWS is a "public cloud" etc
[21:49:06] <gwozniak> No, I have no access to such things
[21:49:16] <manicennui> Most people build their private commercial code with "public" CI systems.
[21:49:24] <manicennui> I don't know what you mean.
[21:49:41] <dimadima> i'm saying most builds don't fail cause they run out of memory?
[21:49:42] <gwozniak> We have a Jenkins service running on some k8s thing that uses AWS machines
[21:49:47] <gwozniak> Mine sure do!
[21:50:03] <manicennui> I assume this is not an uncommon problem.
[21:50:12] <dimadima> right i'm saying, perhaps ignorantly, that your build is unusually intense
[21:50:20] <manicennui> But the only compiled code we use is small Go programs.
[21:50:38] <manicennui> dimadima: Running monster test suites is not unusual.
[21:50:42] <gwozniak> dimadima: our small build takes ~4 hours
[21:50:43] <manicennui> We have all kinds of problems with tests.
[21:50:46] <jjuran> When I build clang, linking alone takes over a minute and half
[21:50:50] <gwozniak> Most of that is testing
[21:50:59] <dimadima> manicennui: a monster test suite doesn't need lots of ram, it needs lots of parallelism usually, imo
[21:51:03] <dimadima> imo => in my understanding
[21:51:07] <gwozniak> Running the tests takes a long time
[21:51:12] <manicennui> dimadima: Depends on what the tests do.
[21:51:17] <dimadima> that's true
[21:51:23] <gwozniak> Some of ours are pretty intensive
[21:51:36] <dimadima> i think i'll have to abort out of this because this is probably not the best case for attempting to generalize
[21:51:41] <gwozniak> But we generally ran out of memory when building the compiler toolchain
[21:52:27] <dimadima> or i'm not informed enough to intelligently generalize this
[21:52:30] <gwozniak> We have a beefy local server for the "big" toolchains, and we fear that using the Jenkins service will cause a lot of slowdown
[21:53:19] <manicennui> dimadima: That shouldn't stop you.
[21:53:21] <manicennui> This is IRC.
[21:53:36] <gwozniak> I don't know much about k8s, but our setup seems very geared toward small, simple builds.  Our stuff just isn't that, nor will it be
[21:53:37] <manicennui> I don't think anyone is expecting you to solve gwozniak's problem.
[21:53:50] <gwozniak> No, I'm not expecting any solutions here
[21:54:01] <dimadima> lol i know
[21:54:07] <indigo> This is a safe space for venting
[21:54:13] <gwozniak> heh
[21:54:14] <dimadima> i just try to stop myself generally when i realize i'm im talking out of my as
[21:54:14] <manicennui> I think that's one of the problems with most k8s implementations: using k8s is not your goal, but it is front and center.
[21:54:17] <dimadima> ass*
[21:54:40] <manicennui> But the expectation now is that everyone is involved in every level of software.
[21:54:42] <gwozniak> Some other teams here have tests that run for days
[21:54:57] <manicennui> Which just leads to us all knowing a little bit about a lot of things and not knowing most of them well enough to be effective.
[21:55:05] <dimadima> well that's basically exactly why i use k8s
[21:55:15] <dimadima> i'm involved with every level of my software
[21:55:18] <dimadima> :(
[21:55:39] <dimadima> fun fact last night i backed up my .password-store and did not back up my .gnugp :(
[21:55:45] <gwozniak> So a "microservice" style approach that seems to suit our k8s installation/setup doesn't really fit
[21:56:05] <gwozniak> When I first set this up, I was told to break my build up into smaller pieces and run them independently
[21:56:07] <dimadima> tests that run for days
[21:56:25] <gwozniak> To which my response was basically, "oh you sweet, summer child"
[21:56:33] <indigo> dimadima: I don't do backups :( just store all my important shit in iCloud
[21:56:50] <gwozniak> dimadima: yes, hardware simulator validation and such can take a long time
[21:56:53] <indigo> gwozniak: Lol, but microservices solve everything!
[21:56:54] <manicennui> Yeah, I keep anything I care about in some cloud drive.
[21:57:00] <manicennui> I can lose anything else.
[21:57:05] <dimadima> i just backup my password store and the gpg keys. everything else can fuck off if need be
[21:57:10] <dimadima> and ssh keys
[21:57:34] <manicennui> I've never gotten a straight answer on the best approach for ssh keys.
[21:57:39] <dimadima> gwozniak: you should break up that suite into smaller suites
[21:57:41] <dimadima> lol
[21:57:54] <dimadima> manicennui: what do you mean? to back up or not to back up?
[21:58:28] <gwozniak> I recently deleted some stuff by accident and haven't restored it.  I mostly haven't missed it
[21:58:39] <manicennui> All methods of copying ssh keys have downsides.
[21:59:05] <manicennui> Or at least require you to really trust some third-party service.
[21:59:07] <dimadima> because it usually involves changing their permissions from 400?
[21:59:12] <Brekkjern> Shouldn't copy SSH keys between machines. Better to have one per machine.
[21:59:38] <dimadima> yeah i mean i guess if i have my github password i'm good.
[21:59:38] <manicennui> Brekkjern: What happens if my machine dies, and I don't have another machine with access to a resource?
[21:59:57] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Then you break out the backup key from the vault.
[22:00:08] <manicennui> The vault?
[22:00:11] <indigo> Excuse me, Github? We only use artisanal code hosting services like sourcehut here
[22:00:21] <kline> ddv's art is anal
[22:00:39] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Safe/lockbox/whatever
[22:01:06] <jjuran> When pulling away a façade exposes another, which then falls away revealing yet another, it's a fascade
[22:01:09] <dimadima> hehehe indigo
[22:01:26] <manicennui> Brekkjern: So you recommend keeping a copy on a USB drive and locking it up physically?
[22:01:42] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Yeah. Works for me.
[22:01:48] <dimadima> i'd like to share that i just received/used te following one-time code: f0000c
[22:02:08] <kline> fascade is when you unbundle the sticks into a small screen
[22:02:10] <dimadima> which in my mind i immediately read as "fuuuuuuk"
[22:02:17] <dimadima> "fooook"
[22:02:23] <manicennui> https://i.redd.it/q35cumc22ur71.jpg
[22:02:53] <dimadima> just neg
[22:02:54] <dimadima> next question
[22:03:07] <jjuran> kline: It's also the koolaid drunk by fascists
[22:03:26] <kline> jjuran, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasces the sticks you unbundle
[22:03:26] <buttsbot> Fasces - Wikipedia
[22:03:34] <manicennui> I wish I could go back to having very little stuff.
[22:03:41] <manicennui> I guess I technically can.
[22:03:46] <manicennui> But getting rid of stuff is such a pain.
[22:03:46] <kline> manicennui, thankfully this is very easy compared to going the other way
[22:04:05] <manicennui> And it would be hard to convince myself to get rid of some things.
[22:04:12] <dimadima> are you talking about stuff in general?
[22:04:16] <manicennui> Yes.
[22:04:30] <indigo> I was reading about FAANG burnout on Reddit, and one of the comments was to watch Tech Lead videos on youtube
[22:05:20] <dimadima> i didn't realize FAANG can get you 300,400,500k
[22:05:30] <manicennui> Really?
[22:05:45] <manicennui> Non-FAANG can get you $200k+ now.
[22:05:47] <dimadima> that's what i've been seeing recently. it started making sense when i saw those numbers
[22:05:47] <bkero> What is a Tech Lead video?
[22:05:49] <imode> I make $150k TC.
[22:05:58] <imode> living in a low COL area.
[22:05:59] <manicennui> dimadima: I meant, you didn't realize that.
[22:06:05] <imode> well, relatively low COL.
[22:06:06] <companion_cube> TC?
[22:06:09] <imode> total compensation.
[22:06:11] <dimadima> manicennui: well yeah, i've been living under a rock
[22:06:20] <imode> base salary, stock grants, bonuses, etc.
[22:06:29] <companion_cube> ah I see.
[22:06:29] <manicennui> My base salary is $145.5k.
[22:06:38] <imode> mine is $128.
[22:06:38] <manicennui> And Chicago isn't very expensive.
[22:06:46] <imode> amazon's heeeeavy on equity.
[22:06:51] <manicennui> I know people making $175k base doing Rails.
[22:06:55] <manicennui> In Chicago.
[22:07:04] <dimadima> pretty sick!
[22:07:04] <imode> small shops?
[22:07:08] <imode> shit hire me pls.
[22:07:17] <imode> hate what I'm doing and hate the infra that I'm doing it with.
[22:07:22] <manicennui> My employer is a public company with over $1 billion in revenue.
[22:07:35] <companion_cube> imode: but aren't you WEBSCALE at amazon?
[22:07:48] <imode> we have someone doing fucking ML on the terabytes of stack traces we have for old financial transactions because nobody wants to comb over them.
[22:08:00] <imode> k-means clustering.
[22:08:07] <manicennui> If you do something like Scala you can easily break $200k here.
[22:08:09] <imode> my brain hurts when I think of that.
[22:08:26] <dimadima> pfft terabytes whateva
[22:08:27] <imode> companion_cube: take me down to the farm.
[22:08:33] <manicennui> My bonus and RSU targets are 10 and 15%.
[22:08:47] <companion_cube> wait, scala pays better?
[22:08:50] <imode> any bullshit leetcode interviews?
[22:08:54] <manicennui> So total compensation is around $180k.
[22:08:58] <manicennui> companion_cube: Yes.
[22:09:03] <companion_cube> I'd do scala :p
[22:09:09] <imode> I did scala!
[22:09:12] <imode> and go.
[22:09:13] <dimadima> seems like you can't get paid w/o leetcode interviews
[22:09:15] * Geekingfrog doesn't believe companion_cube 
[22:09:24] <companion_cube> there's static types and sum types
[22:09:25] <manicennui> dimadima: I have never done any kind of leetcode nonsense.
[22:09:29] <companion_cube> what else does a man need
[22:09:38] <dimadima> manicennui: oh you meant there are none?
[22:09:40] <imode> manicennui: sign me the fuck up.
[22:09:46] <dimadima> i'd take 145 w/o leetcode
[22:09:53] <imode> same.
[22:09:54] <companion_cube> there comes manicennui's referral bonus
[22:10:11] <manicennui> You probably won't want to work for us once you find out what we really do.
[22:10:15] <imode> do tell.
[22:10:17] <manicennui> But there are plenty of companies in Chicago that pay well.
[22:10:20] <dimadima> i love math and compsci but i didn't study compsci and i'm not going to do leetcode just to get a job
[22:10:28] <imode> they do remote work?
[22:10:28] <manicennui> imode: Sub-prime and near-prime lending.
[22:10:38] <manicennui> imode: Yes.
[22:10:41] <indigo> imode: Don't you work at Amazon?
[22:10:44] <imode> indigo: yeah and it sucks.
[22:10:54] <imode> the pay is shite for what we do.
[22:11:09] <imode> though I'll be singing a different tune once my shares vest.
[22:11:31] <manicennui> I think Amazon base salaries tend to be a bit higher. Options are pretty much everything.
[22:11:41] <indigo> Ah yes... the weird vesting structure for Amazon
[22:11:45] <manicennui> Bonuses and perks sound bad.
[22:12:01] <manicennui> They are also decent about small signing bonuses it seems.
[22:12:07] <ben> i could use a raise
[22:12:10] <imode> same.
[22:12:14] <imode> been here about two years.
[22:12:21] <indigo> My dad works there... he likes it way better than FB for what it's worth
[22:12:23] <manicennui> I just want to work with better people and better tech.
[22:12:25] <indigo> But then again he works in hardware
[22:12:37] <imode> indigo: hardware work at amazon iirc is pretty damn solid.
[22:12:45] <ben> i'm still at 97k
[22:12:56] <imode> I just want a raise so my mother can retire.
[22:12:56] <manicennui> ben: How many years experience?
[22:13:02] <manicennui> And which country?
[22:13:03] <ben> 5
[22:13:04] <ben> US
[22:13:10] <manicennui> Little on the low side.
[22:13:13] <ben> yeah
[22:13:28] <manicennui> We start people in that range.
[22:13:32] <ben> i've been meaning to feel around and get some offers
[22:13:45] <ben> see if i can get another raise here otherwise i'll take a job elsewhere
[22:14:10] <manicennui> Even if they give you a raise, I'd just use it to negotiate a better offer elsewhere.
[22:14:28] <ben> yeah
[22:14:28] <manicennui> What are the chances that they will give you decent raises if they give in to doing it once?
[22:14:55] <ben> i mean i started at 67k here so i've gotten a couple decent raises
[22:15:12] <manicennui> We get raises and bonuses around February/March, then I'll probably leave this place.
[22:15:27] <ben> fair
[22:15:31] <manicennui> ben: Sure, but they haven't kept pace with the market.
[22:15:39] <ben> yea
[22:15:42] <manicennui> I'm guessing you live in an area with a low cost of living.
[22:15:48] <manicennui> And they think they aren't competing with everyone in the US.
[22:16:20] <ben> it's high compared to anything close to here but low compared to big cities
[22:16:53] <manicennui> I think many employers are in for a rude awakening now that there are so many remote jobs.
[22:17:07] <ben> def
[22:17:24] <manicennui> They didn't get it before because they just lost candidates due to their low offers.
[22:17:41] <manicennui> But they dismiss it as, "Well, we can't compete with the West Coast companies!"
[22:18:48] <manicennui> I've never understood that thinking. Unless your market is very small and local, you are absolutely competing with those companies whether you want to or not.
[22:19:26] <ben> yeah for sure
[22:19:33] <dimadima> lots of institutions don't care
[22:19:38] <manicennui> If you aren't willing to pay the salaries that top candidates demand, then your staff probably isn't as good as your competitors.
[22:19:39] <dimadima> my mom works at a university, for example
[22:19:46] <manicennui> dimadima: Sure, I get universities.
[22:19:58] <dimadima> lots of ppl will take the 100k and stay there for decades
[22:20:38] <manicennui> But if you sell some service or whatever on the Internet, your competitor who is hiring people for top dollar because they are in a more expensive market sells to the same people.
[22:21:07] <companion_cube> 100k at a univ? that's already pretty good
[22:21:10] <manicennui> I guess as long as the company paying less somehow stays in business, they don't care.
[22:21:35] <manicennui> Take payment processing companies.
[22:21:56] <manicennui> You can't setup a company in Bumfuck, Iowa and pay low salaries and hope to compete with Stripe and others.
[22:22:04] <manicennui> Braintree is here, and they pay quite a bit better than average.
[22:22:23] <manicennui> The market is not local businesses.
[22:24:39] <manicennui> I think people are stuck in their 19th century factory work mindset.
[22:25:36] <companion_cube> it's a bit hard to accept that there's already a multinational you can't compete against
[22:25:51] <manicennui> We are making widgets for the Chicagoland area!
[22:28:55] <dimadima> what kind
[22:29:05] <dimadima> okay, sorry i had ot
[22:29:29] <imode> 100k at a university would make me shit my pants.
[22:29:38] <manicennui> That is the mentality of many companies.
[22:30:11] <manicennui> Or at least how they act.
[22:30:13] <imode> like, uni is a cushy place.
[22:30:26] <manicennui> imode: Has its own set of problems though.
[22:30:32] <imode> yes, yes it does.
[22:30:38] <dimadima> imode: lots of ppl do that where my mom works
[22:30:40] <imode> get over those, though, and man your life can be easy.
[22:30:45] <dimadima> lots of politics, but it's not amazon
[22:31:04] <imode> tbf amazon isn't that bad. my job isn't that bad. hell I haven't done.. hardly anything today.
[22:31:11] <manicennui> Plus, you have to be around young people.
[22:31:18] <imode> but I love education.
[22:31:27] <imode> I don't know what it is about it, but I love teaching.
[22:31:30] <manicennui> I love educating myself.
[22:31:31] <dimadima> imode: but they have, like, expectations
[22:31:36] <dimadima> at my mom's job, there are no real expectations
[22:31:41] <dimadima> i mean, they are LOW
[22:32:01] <imode> maybe I should hit up the university of washington.
[22:32:06] <imode> see if they have any openings.
[22:32:17] <dimadima> my mom's at JHU, probably not so different from most unis
[22:32:36] <dimadima> udub probably the same. though who knwos
[22:32:46] <dimadima> it's boring having no expectations, but it's also chill
[22:32:49] <manicennui> imode: I feel like Seattle is not the place to make a lower salary.
[22:32:52] <dimadima> lots of politiking though
[22:33:26] <imode> manicennui: for some reason I can't parse the meaning behind what you just said.
[22:33:34] <imode> halp. :(
[22:33:43] <Brekkjern> He's saying Seattle's expensive
[22:33:48] <imode> oh, I don't live there.
[22:33:49] <imode> thank god.
[22:33:51] <imode> I live north.
[22:33:52] <manicennui> imode: Assuming you mean U of Washington in Seattle, and assuming they likely pay even less than Amazon, that doesn't seem like a great move.
[22:34:13] <manicennui> If I were going for the easy university life, I'd want to live in a small university town somewhere.
[22:34:14] <companion_cube> univ gives you more freedom
[22:34:24] <imode> I kinda already do to some extent.
[22:34:38] <manicennui> imode: I also wouldn't want a long commute.
[22:34:39] <imode> give me $140k/yr with no bonuses or stock grants and I'll be happy as a fuckin clam.
[22:34:43] <imode> oh god no, remote for this dude.
[22:34:58] <Church> I wanna get to $200k~
[22:35:09] <manicennui> How has Amazon been about remote work?
[22:35:17] <imode> we aren't back "in office" until jan.
[22:35:22] <Church> Because $18k~ a month sounds nice
[22:35:29] <imode> imo remote work was the best thing that happened to this company.
[22:35:37] <Church> imode: At amazon right?
[22:35:40] <imode> everything is based in india anyway.
[22:35:42] <imode> Church: yuh.
[22:35:44] <manicennui> imode: Have they indicated whether they will consider actual remote positions?
[22:35:55] <imode> nnnnnnnope, they keep pushing for hybrid.
[22:36:15] <imode> 3 in-office days, 2 remote days, and I believe 4 weeks of remote time allocated.
[22:36:18] <manicennui> My employer finally gave in. I think a big chunk of people will be hybrid, but many of us will be able to be fully remote.
[22:36:22] <indigo> You can apply for remote only with Google, if you're interested. Definitely Leetcode interviews there though
[22:36:40] <imode> I really don't want to work for Google.
[22:36:45] <bkero> A lot of places do leetcode interviews these days
[22:38:11] <imode> if I had a choice between working for google and building a startup, I'd choose the latter every day.
[22:38:21] <imode> with all of the pains that that entails.
[22:39:04] <gwozniak> We don't do leetcode interviews here.  Doesn't say much, though
[22:39:19] <indigo> All right :)
[22:39:20] <imode> they don't measure _anything_.
[22:39:29] <gwozniak> We all hate them
[22:40:06] <gwozniak> We do a very mild version of them for those fresh out of school to see if they at least know something
[22:40:18] <gwozniak> Because we don't have much else to go on
[22:41:16] <Brekkjern> I think it's fair to have people do something simple, but I'd avoid something like "build a linked list" as you'd end up with people blanking from trying to remember it instead of having them figuring things out by themselves
[22:42:02] <gwozniak> I mostly want to test and see how they read code, since that is what they will mainly be doing here
[22:42:05] <indigo> I think candidates should build a piece of IKEA furniture during their interview
[22:42:12] <gwozniak> lol
[22:42:19] <Brekkjern> Hah
[22:42:26] <imode> "here's a piece of code, can you explain what it does, and where the faults may be".
[22:42:36] <manicennui> I don't understand jokes about having problems building IKEA furniture.
[22:42:53] <bkero> https://erikmcclure.com/blog/factorio-is-best-interview-we-have/
[22:42:53] <buttsbot> Factorio Is The Best Technical Interview We Have
[22:43:23] <Brekkjern> Should stealthily steal one screw or something so they have to figure out how they do problem solving missing a screw :P
[22:43:51] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Continue the interview in 2 weeks after you contact IKEA and get them to send you one?
[22:43:58] <manicennui> Or run to a hardware store to try to find a match.
[22:43:59] <Brekkjern> Hah
[22:44:18] <Brekkjern> They would hate you for springing shit like that in an interview :P
[22:44:20] <bkero> Judge them based on if they know about head shape, thread pitch, and length.
[22:44:36] <imode> bkero: I forsee a service that provides a minified factorio environment with multiple challenges to screen candidates against.
[22:44:43] <manicennui> I don't want furniture that is kludged together.
[22:45:19] <indigo> I'm a big fan of take-home interviews, but something that you can do in an hour or so
[22:45:33] <Brekkjern> I really don't want to do Factorio as an interview... Would take like 80 hours
[22:45:49] <dimadima> i resent anything that's a puzzle or a game
[22:45:59] <manicennui> I think we already have the perfect example of a good interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJRmY9VXf1g
[22:46:00] <buttsbot> The Last Starfighter (1/10) Movie CLIP - Record Breaker (1984) HD - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJRmY9VXf1g
[22:46:13] <Brekkjern> >This video is not available
[22:46:33] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Have you seen The Last Starfighter?
[22:46:35] <Brekkjern> That said: This one is the best:
[22:46:35] <Brekkjern> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4iFzweRf3E
[22:46:36] <buttsbot> pre Monty Python Job Interview sketch - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4iFzweRf3E
[22:46:40] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Nope
[22:46:58] <manicennui> Brekkjern: There is an arcade machine that is really a test to become a starfighter.
[22:47:01] <Church> indigo: Yeah startups have worked fairly well for me.
[22:47:02] <manicennui> For aliens.
[22:47:12] <Church> 1/2 have done well and got bought out
[22:47:17] <Church> So that's not a bad rate there
[22:47:36] <Church> Admittedly if I didn't get so lucky and worked at more that rate would drop quickkk
[22:47:38] <manicennui> The only entertainment in the trailer park comes from an arcade game called "Starfighter", in which the player defends "the Frontier" against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada in a space battle. After Alex becomes the game's highest-scoring player, he is approached by the game's inventor, Centauri, who invites him to take a ride in his fancy car as a prize for winning the game. Centauri is actually an alien and his car a spacecraft
[22:48:18] <manicennui> Same thing that happens with Eli in SGU.
[22:48:45] <Brekkjern> I can't remember much about what happens in SGU :S
[22:48:48] <Brekkjern> Been too long
[22:48:56] <manicennui> There is some puzzle in a game and Eli solves it.
[22:49:04] <manicennui> It was actually based on a problem they were having with the stargate.
[22:49:17] <manicennui> So they recruit him.
[22:49:31] <Brekkjern> Ah
[22:49:41] <manicennui> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4on10F20BCU
[22:49:42] <buttsbot> Stargate Universe - Recruiting Eli Wallace - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4on10F20BCU
[22:49:59] <manicennui> The best part is when they beam him up to the ship.
[22:51:29] <indigo> Church: Wow, that's pretty good
[22:51:41] <indigo> Did your options work out?
[22:51:48] <Church> Eyep
[22:51:51] <Church> Got bought out
[22:51:59] <Church> Which was nice, I never gave them a thought
[22:52:19] <Church> Think I may get a bonus as well if we hit our revenue goal this year?
[22:52:22] <Church> Which'll be nice
[22:52:47] <kline> is there anyone here who is a GC for a project on libera?
[22:52:58] <kline> i suppose i could just look but thats haaaard
[22:53:16] <gwozniak> manicennui: I think what I love most about that Last Starfighter clip is how excited the whole town is that he's going to break the record on an arcade game
[22:54:23] <gwozniak> And that they come out to watch
[22:54:28] <manicennui> heh
[22:54:31] <manicennui> Yeah, that is great.
[22:55:25] <gwozniak> I give the actors a lot of credit because they had to be just baffled by what the script is calling for
[22:56:16] <manicennui> At the time I remember thinking that the space battles were amazing.
[22:56:24] <manicennui> They did not hold up well at all.
[22:56:40] <gwozniak> Oh yeah, when I was a kid that movie was great
[22:56:56] <gwozniak> I think I'll have to watch it now
[22:57:27] <manicennui> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNvUsTBGyE
[22:57:27] <buttsbot> The Last Starfighter (8/10) Movie CLIP - Death Blossom (1984) HD - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLNvUsTBGyE
[22:58:44] <gwozniak> I don't even have to click on that and I know what it is :)
[22:58:58] <gwozniak> Watching anyway, of course
[22:59:37] <indigo> Good ol' 80s CGI
[23:00:10] <gwozniak> I think I read the comic about 100 times because it was about the only comic I had for a while
[23:00:14] <kline> >This video is not available
[23:00:20] <kline> womp womp
[23:00:38] <manicennui> The Last Starfighter is just too bad ass for people who aren't in North America.
[23:01:28] <manicennui> TLS is another example of a movie that they couldn't do today.
[23:01:35] <manicennui> Not because of any content that would be offensive or anything.
[23:01:43] <manicennui> But because it would be absolute garbage.
[23:02:50] <manicennui> They'd cast some teen idol, somehow manage to use more CGI than the original, add some product placement, add a central love story, and somehow complicate the plot until it doesn't make sense.
[23:03:34] <ngoldbaum> lmao the recurse center is hiring for these charlatans https://www.costarastrology.com
[23:03:35] <buttsbot> Co – Star: Hyper-Personalized, Real-Time Horoscopes
[23:04:00] <Geekingfrog> :D
[23:04:11] <manicennui> AI horoscope
[23:04:19] <manicennui> Thank god someone is working on this!
[23:04:40] <manicennui> I like how they feel the need to mention NASA.
[23:04:57] <manicennui> As though it is anything more than some public NASA dataset about star locations or something.
[23:05:14] <manicennui> AI AND NASA
[23:05:27] <ngoldbaum> tbh makes me a little pissed they’d say yes to working with these clowns
[23:05:44] <manicennui> It's possible that they didn't.
[23:05:51] <manicennui> Might just be some public data from Nasa's site.
[23:05:57] <manicennui> Or you mean the recurse center?
[23:06:03] <manicennui> I don't even know what that is.
[23:06:03] <ngoldbaum> yeah the recurse center
[23:06:14] <ngoldbaum> they’re paying RC to do recruiting
[23:06:21] <manicennui> Some kind of bootcamp?
[23:06:28] <companion_cube> star boot camp*
[23:06:37] <riv> that is a weird pivot
[23:06:39] <ngoldbaum> i’m a little surprised you can hang out here and have never heard of it
[23:07:05] <ngoldbaum> it’s not a bootcamp, there’s no curriculum
[23:07:36] <ngoldbaum> they make money by being a recruiter but you don’t have to use their jobs service
[23:07:46] <ngoldbaum> no ISAs!
[23:08:35] <manicennui> Oh, didn't someone share their social rules recently?
[23:08:40] <manicennui> And didn't you just violate one of them?
[23:08:53] <manicennui> https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-feigning-surprise
[23:08:54] <buttsbot> Social rules - Recurse Center
[23:09:36] <ngoldbaum> so you have heard of it :p
[23:13:45] <manicennui> There is this good channel on YT about cleaning, and the woman who runs it also has or had a cleaning business. I'm wondering whether she now makes more from YT.

[23:26:41] <Church> Still wanna do a week long retreat
[23:26:49] <Church> Stringent to get in, doubt I would.
[23:27:25] <kline> let them decide that, dont self-reject
[23:27:51] <manicennui> Reject their rejection.
[23:34:35] <manicennui> We have these silly internal things like #win and shoutouts, and it's interesting to see that the product I work on, which makes more revenue and profit than any other product by a large margin, rarely participates in this stuff.
[23:49:34] *** Quits: klardotsh (~klardotsh@75-172-2-244.tukw.qwest.net) (Quit: nyaa~)
[23:50:07] <Brekkjern> I hate tasks like these... Gotta rewrite this to use lambdas instead of let:
[23:50:08] <Brekkjern> (let ((bar foo)
[23:50:08] <Brekkjern>        (baz 'towel))
[23:50:08] <Brekkjern>    (let ((bar (list bar baz))
[23:50:08] <Brekkjern>           (foo baz))
[23:50:08] <Brekkjern>      (list foo bar)))
[23:50:26] <imode> why?
[23:50:33] <imode> I mean nested lets suck but.
[23:50:45] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:50:53] <imode> school assignment?
[23:51:00] <Brekkjern> Uni, yeah
[23:51:13] <Brekkjern> If someone asked me to do that at work I'd slap them...
[23:51:28] <Brekkjern> Especially if they had given me that code as the example...
[23:51:40] *** Joins: klardotsh (~klardotsh@75-172-2-244.tukw.qwest.net)
[23:52:04] <ngoldbaum> is it just me or does using tons of metasyntactic generic names like foo and bar just make your brain turn off?
[23:52:10] <ngoldbaum> i hate really abstract shit
[23:52:11] <imode> especially with lisp.
[23:52:14] <Brekkjern> It's not just you...
[23:52:37] <imode> if it makes your brain turn off, it means they're misused.
[23:52:39] *** Quits: klardotsh (~klardotsh@75-172-2-244.tukw.qwest.net) (Client Quit)
[23:52:48] <riv> it's good to know how let transforms into lambda
[23:53:21] <Brekkjern> riv: Is it? I mean... Does it give you some higher enlightnment about how computers work?
[23:53:31] <riv> it lets you understand how let relates to lambda
[23:53:37] <riv> (let ((x u) (y v)) body) just becomes ((lambda (x y) body) u v)
[23:54:02] <Brekkjern> Yes, but in what way does that matter?
[23:54:14] <imode> excessive use of let means excessive use of lambdas.
[23:54:29] <imode> and it's important to see how that use can shape how your program functions.
[23:54:37] <riv> it explains the semantics of let in terms of lambda
[23:54:45] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: is the class meant to teach you lisp?
[23:54:47] <riv> lambda is the main primitive in lisp
[23:54:52] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: Functional programming
[23:55:11] <ngoldbaum> seems like a reasonable exercise if badly thought out
[23:55:18] <ngoldbaum> pretty bog standard for CS pegagogy
[23:55:52] <imode> yeah.
[23:56:05] <Brekkjern> The fact that it's standard doesn't mean it's good.
[23:56:18] <Brekkjern> See any equipment made to MIL-spec
[23:56:38] <riv> i dont think this is the right thing to complain about
[23:56:42] <ngoldbaum> i think at MIT they make you do TAoCP in scheme?
[23:56:45] <riv> it's helpful to learn this
[23:56:48] <imode> it is.
[23:56:51] <ngoldbaum> or used to anyway
[23:57:18] <imode> ngoldbaum: TaoCP or SICP?
[23:57:31] <ngoldbaum> excuse me sicp
[23:57:43] <manicennui> Yeah, they switched to some Python material instead.
[23:57:46] <imode> TAoCP you can spend a lifetime on.
[23:58:14] <Brekkjern> You can spend a lifetime getting through the first chapter of SICP too... It's so fucking verbose.
[23:58:39] <imode> that's probably why I rarely go back to it.
[23:59:21] <imode> it's not really that educational (I mean, it is), but it reads like someone's very enthusiastic writings on scheme.
