[05:03:05] <ogra> sarnold, i think popey packaged it originally ... and perhaps only tested from an enduser perspective ... adding a system-files interface for /var/mail access might be enough though
[05:04:25] <sarnold> ogra: heh, that doesn't feel like entirely the right name for that :) and probably a postfix or procmail snap would want similar accesses, too..

[05:06:47] <ogra> well, getting a new interface into snapd can take months (or longer if someone thinks an architect needs to review it) ... a system-files entry in snapcraft.yaml is just 4 lines and being nice to alex and emilia in the forum to get it auto-connected 😉
[05:07:55] <ogra> but yeah, might make sense in the long term to have some "mail-spool" interface or some such

[05:40:53] <sarnold> ednash: apt-rdepends is great for these kinds of questions, but it runs according to your apt sources..
[05:41:27] <sarnold> (though it supports an --option=Apt::Option::Here thing, maybe that could be used to use different apt sources than The System apt sources)
[05:41:35] <ednash> thanks
[05:41:53] <ednash> i might install it in a virtual machine to see
[05:42:58] <ednash> but i guess it won't add that much info now that the link confirms firefox is a snap package

[06:32:02] <Lebela_> I was told to come here from #bash
[06:32:31] <Lebela_> I currently mount my external LUKS encrypted devices by using  "tail -f /var/log/syslog"  and seeing what new device comes in.
[06:32:33] <jhutchins> pycurious: Yeah, open the case, clean the components, reseat modules, cards, and cables.
[06:32:38] <Lebela_> then:   sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdc1 foo

[06:33:02] <Lebela_> the goal is, to auto-mount the luks encrypted drives, but the /dev/ mountpoint changes
[06:33:07] <Lebela_> so it must the the UUID we're looking at
[06:33:12] <jhutchins> UUID
[06:33:19] <Lebela_> the LUKS container has a different UUID than the filesystem inside

[12:18:06] <k_sze> Something isn't right. On Ubuntu 20.04 (on WSL2), `cp -r` behaves differently depending on whether the destination folder already exists. Is that normal?

[12:22:16] <matsaman> k_sze: yeah
[12:22:47] <llutz> k_sze: should be. If destination not exists, it will create it and you get a copy of "source". If destination exists, it will copy "source" into that
[12:23:06] <k_sze> Looks like I need to add `-T` for it to be "idempotent", regardless of whether the destination already exists.
[12:24:54] <matsaman> think I'd either switch to rsync
[12:24:56] <matsaman> or
[12:25:02] <matsaman> use test -d

[14:35:26] <Fossil> Is there anyway I could detect which network interface has link, BEFORE either interface has been configured? Im dumping images back onto different hardware so the iface names keep changing rendering my netplan.yml useless because I need to go in and set the correct interface name. "ip link" doesn't do much because it shows DOWN until a proper IP or DHCP has been configured on the correct iface name. Trying to script this.

[21:47:06] <spacedust> cause i dont have space
[21:48:27] <sarnold> spacedust: you might do better to ask snapd to only store one or two of everything
[21:49:04] <spacedust> one or two of everything ?
[21:49:07] <spacedust> what do you mean ?
[21:49:11] <spacedust> it stores older versions ?
[21:50:03] <sarnold> spacedust: yes; https://snapcraft.io/docs/keeping-snaps-up-to-date#heading--refresh-retain
[21:50:24] <leftyfb> spacedust: I have about 70 snap files (about 40 actual snaps installed snap totaling 6.6G. Do you not have ~10G of free space on your machine or do you have more than 40 snaps installed?
[21:50:25] <sarnold> spacedust: run mount | grep /snaps/   and you'll see what it's got
