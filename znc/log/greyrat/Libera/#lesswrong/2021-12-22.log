[06:32:32] <gwern> that's amazing, but for everyone else, the only way you're going to win a nobel prize is if you did the work 50 years ago like penrose or the anti-malaria woman, or if you invented a time machine (so you could go back in time and publish the time machine *then*)

[07:26:15] <PapuaHardyNet> so most aesthetics are actually larping
[07:26:24] <PapuaHardyNet> by aesthetics I mean clothing and fashion
[07:26:50] <PapuaHardyNet> so for example, dark academia is basically normal people larping as EU private school high class students
[07:27:09] <PapuaHardyNet> techwear is larping as post apocalyptic or prepper
[07:27:33] <PapuaHardyNet> they are focusing on the simulacra instead of the actual point or even the social group
[07:27:42] <gwern> and workwear is larping as lumberjacks etc
[07:27:56] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder whether it is a conscious or an unconscious attempt to join the relevant social group, to improve one's social status
[07:27:59] <gwern> much art and esthetics originates as function, and eventually just freefloats as form
[07:28:47] <gwern> my theory tends to be multi-level selection: it's not just about hipsters signaling they are a workingman *in spirit*, but that function drives deep exploration of form
[07:29:16] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting
[07:29:19] <gwern> we respond to the coherency of an outfit honed over centuries by craftsmen for optimal foxhunting, even if we've never sat on a horse in our lives
[07:29:41] <gwern> that it is optimized for what are de facto arbitrary constraints now, is not relevant. we respond to the optimization
[07:29:56] <gwern> the inner logic, the compression of perception
[07:30:06] <PapuaHardyNet> so according to you it isn't simply social status signalling and an attempt to get into a social group, but also that the outfit itself has some fundamental features that make it pleasing to the senses
[07:30:42] <gwern> yes. it will have a fractal dimension of features, extensive symmetries, features whose purpose is not apparent initially but become on further learning...
[07:31:24] <gwern> think of AI or generative artwork. it is often optimizing a completely arbitrary and silly loss function, or following a simple but arbitrary rule. and yet, we can look at it and get far more out of it than if it was random static
[07:31:55] <PapuaHardyNet> I see
[07:32:13] <gwern> if you sat down, you'd never design a 1940s bomber jacket that japanese fashion nerds will slaver over for decades to come
[07:32:19] <rmmh> PapuaHardyNet: clothes maketh the man
[07:32:37] <gwern> it's just too idiosyncratic and specific a point in design space. but functional requirements can drive bomber jackets' development into A Thing
[07:33:00] <gwern> after a certain point, it hardly matters that "wait, didn't guys wearing this kill my granddad?"
[07:33:27] <gwern> you just appreciate the exact of replication, its suitability for a purpose (however obsolete)
[07:34:03] <gwern> this is why brands like Red Wing straddle the line. the people who buy Red Wing boots because they actually need them keep the boots 'honest'

[07:34:30] <gwern> they maintain the 'quality without a name'
[07:34:57] <gwern> (have I never written about this?)
[07:35:54] <PapuaHardyNet> how much do you think one should value this ethereal notion of "authenticity"? I believe that most people overvalue this (they are allegedly called hipsters, according to chats here), so I guess consciously optimizing for aesthetics is more sensible than optimizing for signalling "authenticity"
[07:36:36] <gwern> 'authenticity' raises hackles because it is about seeming good rather than being good
[07:36:45] <PapuaHardyNet> and no, I don't recall you writing about this before. then again, I don't really have gwern.net memorized yet
[07:37:27] <gwern> a hipster prefers an 'authentic green' coffee to a 'inauthentic unsustainable' coffee even if he knows the reverse is actually true, as long as they *seem* or can 'be shown' the other way
[07:38:06] <gwern> in its origin, authenticity is a laudable heuristic to make sure you are getting the functional original good, with the quality without a name. but it rapidly decays and becomes a lost purpose
[07:39:01] <gwern> 'authenticity' becomes just many layers of meta 
[07:39:15] <gwern> 'more authentic than thou', never actually returning to the object level

[09:56:36] <quanticle> Expensive? Yes. But I would argue that it's worth it. 
[09:57:41] <quanticle> My complaint is that the product listing says 100W Power Delivery, when in reality, it takes 100W as *input* takes 15W for itself, and then sends the remaining 85W to the laptop
[09:58:02] <quanticle> So it's only *delivering* 85W
[10:01:26] <feep> usb-c is amazing technology but an utterly atrocious plug design
[10:01:50] <quanticle> Yeah, the plug is too small and I constantly worry about it breaking
[10:01:53] <feep> yes everyone loves a weak-ass attachment that ends up ripping the controller off the board if you breathe on it wrong

[10:02:38] <feep> like, do these people not remember sata
[10:02:50] <quanticle> What was wrong with SATA?
[10:03:10] <feep> it had weak-ass attachment too, initially, the current gen of locking plugs is a new thing
[10:03:13] <feep> afair
[10:03:15] <quanticle> I never had any problems with SATA; it was so much better than the W I D E PATA cable
[10:03:35] <quanticle> Especially because the PATA connector would bend pins if you misaligned it even slightly
[10:03:40] <feep> tho, again, otoh, ide cables fucking HELD.
[10:03:48] <quanticle> True
[10:04:02] <quanticle> Once that cable snapped into place, it was locked down
[10:04:27] <feep> yeah
[10:04:36] <feep> srsly, sata is fine... now.
[10:04:44] <feep> now that locking plugs are standard :p
[10:05:32] <quanticle> I don't know, I guess I've never really had any issues with SATA, even without locking plugs. I guess that's the benefit of me buying long cables and using full-tower cases.
[10:05:49] <feep> also sata power supplies are actually hilarious, it's a 15 pin connector but like
[10:05:50] <quanticle> I don't have to stretch cables around weird angles that put tension on them
[10:05:57] <feep> do you really think power needs 15 pins?
[10:06:05] <feep> yeah that's fair
[10:06:23] <feep> but like, look at this chart. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA#Power_connectors
[10:06:24] <Robomot> Serial ATA - Wikipedia [Power connectors] (SATA specifies a different power connector than the four-pin Molex connector used on Parallel ATA (PATA) devices (and earlier small storage devices, going back to ST-506 hard disk drives and even to floppy disk drives that predated the IBM PC). It is a wafer-type connector, like the SATA data connector, but much wider (fifteen pins versus seven) to avoid confusion …)

[10:08:30] <feep> guys, here's an idea, just a weird suggestion, I'm an amateur: fewer pins, bigger wires??
[10:08:42] <quanticle> Yeah, at least motherboards need a bunch of different voltages, so it makes sense for them to have 24 pins or whatever
[10:08:50] <feep> yeah 
[10:09:00] <quanticle> No, fewer pins, bigger wires makes the cable too inflexible

[13:39:03] <kuudes> omicron has already spread to about everywhere, so it will flower now after christmas. we will see on january how different societies have fared.
[13:39:46] <kuudes> uk considers maybe 20% of truck drivers will fall ill simultaneously and that could bring disturbances to the society
[13:40:19] <kuudes> so booster up, self isolate, wear a ffp3
[13:40:32] <pun> I was honestly hoping for omicron to be less problematic and spread a lot faster so that all society gets some times of immunity even those unvaccinated. 
[13:41:18] <pun> like a really low harm/death rate
[13:41:36] <kuudes> there is no certainty of such. from danish data it seems to be maybe as harmful, could be more harmful

[13:51:14] <kuudes> but recently they have had something weird there
[13:51:34] <kuudes> before, it was that for both omicron and nonomicron cases lead to 0.8% hospitalization
[13:52:05] <kuudes> but on 2021-12-15 iirc suddenly some 10k nonomicron cases and 1000 or so hospitalizations appeared
[13:52:13] <kuudes> which was really out of trend
[13:52:33] <kuudes> it could be some sort of error, or that omicron subvariant which has s gene same way as delta
[13:53:05] <kuudes> but presumably we see only post fact if omicron was less, equal or more harmful than delta
[13:53:38] <kuudes> so currently it seems to me one should presume it is not less harmful until shown so
[13:56:09] <pun> I'm looking at the twitter thread you passed and I see pfizer mentioned a few times. Should people just avoid moderna seeing at it was banned for people under 30 in some countries ?
[13:58:48] <kuudes> I don't think so
[13:59:29] <kuudes> as firsthand, one should likely take the measures their doctor recommends them to.
[14:00:05] <kuudes> usually that is currently taking all vaccine doses at time, self isolate during the next few weeks because of omicron, wearing ffp masks

[14:03:20] <kuudes> pfizer may be a bit better against omicron than moderna but the differences are small; likely the best protection is combination of different vaccines
[14:06:17] <pun> what makes you say that "the best protection is a combination of different vaccines" ? Isn't it the same spike protein in the end ?
[14:07:34] <kuudes> in practice, protection for combinations have been observed to be the best
[14:07:57] <kuudes> it likely comes from the different methods for the spike protein to appear into the body
[14:08:14] <kuudes> so different parts of immune system react first, the identification gets smoothed or something
[14:08:18] <kuudes> but I am not a doctor

[14:11:10] <kuudes> oh, btw, my kid had got placebo before, so she got the actual vaccine first time today
[14:11:32] <mjr> Bummer.
[14:11:34] <kuudes> clearly good placebo as we had been pretty certain that she had got the actual vaccine
[14:11:55] <kuudes> good that we took her out of school back then

[14:13:06] <kuudes> mjr, btw, if you have kids younger than 5 year old, as their part of study found the vaccine dose of 3 units to be safe but lacking in efficiency, it will be continued to add third dose. this also means that they open it to add more participants now after new year
[14:13:23] <mjr> Nope.
[14:13:27] <kuudes> ah
[14:13:35] <pun> "so different parts of immune system react first, the identification gets smoothed or something" interesting, so why didn't most states make people take one dose of pfizer and one dose of moderna ?
[14:13:41] <mjr> We're all vaxxed. Adults waiting on boosters.
[14:13:43] <kuudes> did you book vaccine for your 5+ year old?
[14:14:00] <kuudes> ah, your kids got is as risk group?
[14:14:18] <mjr> he's conveniently 12 so went all officially this autumn
[14:15:05] <kuudes> \o/
[14:15:57] <mjr> now mostly worried that he won't get anything for his 7th grade entrance exams late January... *knock knock*
[14:17:17] <synthmeat> cohorts of kids that went mostly online during these years will be very fun thing to study
[14:18:02] <mjr> Anyway Novavax's offering is recommended for approval at EMA. Hopefully that'll get some part of the mRNA-fearing crowd vaxxed...
[14:18:18] <mjr> But of course, it also is a new vaccine and therefore scary.

[15:17:19] <two2thehead> 1. The cost and availability of gasoline. Most petrol stations run on wafer-thin profits for petrol sales. Large numbers of petrol stations will go out of business - particularly in smaller towns and rural areas. It will become increasingly inconvenient as ICE car drivers have to travel further for fuel. As demand drops, production cost will rise. Gasoline will become more expensive. We are already seeing some petrol forecourts install charging 
[15:17:19] <two2thehead> units anticipating the decline of petrol sales.
[15:17:19] <two2thehead> 2. EV's (especially those with good driving assist tech) will be cheaper to insure.
[15:17:21] <two2thehead> 3. EV's are already cheaper to maintain.
[15:17:23] <two2thehead> 4. Like tobacco smoking, driving an ICE car will become "socially unacceptable". People will feel awkward and embarrassed if they use ICE cars.
[15:17:26] <two2thehead> 5. By far the biggest advocates and enthusiasts for EV are under 25. As these young people mature economically, they will be able to afford EV's. Someone who's 21 today will - in the next few years - be in a position to buy an EV - even if the sticker price is higher than an ICE car. They know that TCO (total cost of ownership) is much lower.}

[21:07:04] <kuudes> gwern, well, over here the gas price will just keep growing with the co2 price going up
[21:07:30] <two2thehead> gwern, either or
[21:07:55] <kuudes> finland is not as rich as norway, so electric cars are not that subsidized, but the government used the opportunity to remove the purchase car tax out of them
[21:08:02] <kuudes> and instead increase their usage tax
[21:08:19] <kuudes> purchase tax has been about +100% of factory price
[21:09:46] <two2thehead> hmm "Agricultural markets are examples of nearly perfect competition as well. Imagine shopping at your local farmers' market: there are numerous farmers, selling the same fruits, vegetables and herbs. You can easily find out the prices for the goods, but they are usually all about the same"
[21:09:54] <kuudes> finland already has one of the longest use lifes of cars because of car tax
[21:10:22] <kuudes> the trashing reward of 2000 e toward an ev may incentivize as well
[21:11:12] <kuudes> there was some noise when some person collected qualifying but cheap trash cars from different people for some hundreds per each and bought a tesla for 100ke of rewards
[21:11:33] <two2thehead> gwern, yeah, that's what I wanted. +1
[21:11:45] <kuudes> which was imo along the purpose of the law, just that some politicians had hoped to use it as a booster for used car sales

[21:26:41] <quanticle> gwern, ggreer: Maybe we'll go back to the early days of motorcars where you'd buy gas, in cans, at the hardware store.
[21:28:50] <quanticle> My next car will be electric for sure, but given that 1) my car is new and 2) it's a Subaru, and therefore will last forever, who knows when that'll be. My brother has my old Hyundai. That is 14 years old, and it's still going strong. So yeah, I don't see gas stations being in danger of going out of business any time soon.

[21:34:51] <adiabatic> quanticle: probably not. gas go boom.
[21:35:02] <adiabatic> We're more twitchy about "go boom" things now.
[21:35:11] <quanticle> Nah
[21:35:15] <quanticle> Only new things that go boom
[21:35:21] <quanticle> And it's not like batteries *don't* go boom
[21:35:24] <adiabatic> fertilizer goes boom
[21:35:33] <adiabatic> and fertilizer is pretty lindy
[21:35:36] <adiabatic> even lindier than gas
[21:36:19] <quanticle> Yeah, and you can totally buy ammonium nitrate. You just have to sign for it. 
[21:36:41] <quanticle> In practice, for pretty much everyone who uses ammonium nitrate fertilizer, it's not a huge deal
[21:36:54] <kuudes> at least over here they track ammonium nitrate

[21:37:03] <kuudes> breivik was almost caught but they had snafu
[21:37:23] <kuudes> iirc it triggered by some automata but someone didn't follow it through or something
[21:37:31] <quanticle> Moreover, the other half of ANFO is fuel oil (usually diesel). So even though ANFO has been used in terrorist attacks, I still don't see people tracking diesel sales.
[21:38:02] <quanticle> You need to maybe read less libertarian paranoia
[21:38:12] <two2thehead> kuudes, iirc they did *some* in person checking but the people didn't find it suspicious 
[21:38:48] <kuudes> iirc they were planning to do something more but for some reason they failed to follow the intent
[21:39:03] <kuudes> breivik had also registered himself a farming company for that
[21:44:45] <two2thehead> yeah that was one reason for the lack of suspicion
[21:49:34] <two2thehead> what does lindier mean?
[21:51:17] <adiabatic> "lindy" as an adjective. "lindy" is a newfangled word for "tried and true".
[21:51:24] <adiabatic> Paul Skallas meme, IIRC.

[21:54:07] <quanticle> I like how, in the replies, you can instantly tell the cat owners apart from the dog owners
[21:54:19] <quanticle> Dog owners: Aww look at him, so cute, wagging his tail!

[22:24:17] <kiboneu> good morning
[22:25:03] <kiboneu> i fixed a TMS machine, it sports a maximum 4 teslas on a simple round coild, with configurable pulses between 5us and 5ms
[22:26:15] <kiboneu> any recommendations before putting it on my head? I'm going to try... 1 tesla and 2-4 cm away from my head, maybe close to one of my occipital lobe sides
