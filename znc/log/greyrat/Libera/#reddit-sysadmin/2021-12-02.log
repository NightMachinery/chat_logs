[07:26:39] <viva> hi all, anyone active?
[07:27:28] <Cl0udNinja> ... like...physically..?
[07:28:17] <viva> i'm on a red team doing some white hat offense on our infrastructure... our blue team has set out the scope for us being "scope = apples.com" when i sent off a poss vuln for them to examine they came back and said that the vuln was out of scope bc it was for "www.apples.com" this threw me for a loop because (and im by no means an expert here) i was
[07:28:17] <viva> under the impression all web servers inherently assumed the www (sub?) domain?
[07:28:52] <Cl0udNinja> they do not. you have to explicitly add a dns record pointing as such
[07:28:56] <viva> odd thing is that visiting apples.com auto redirects to www.apples.com (i think that browsers and webservers automatically provide this as a CNAME or perhaps backwards compat?)
[07:29:15] <viva> ok
[07:29:37] <viva> well what if visiting apples.com auto redirects to www.apples.com and its not possible to find any assets on apples.com?
[07:29:56] <Cl0udNinja> people will generally CNAME the www to the root, and add a redirect because its easier to not have to type the www bit
[07:30:00] <viva> and how might i prevent (my? ... the servers?) DNS from resolving www ?
[07:30:09] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> speaking of apples
[07:30:25] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> why doesn't apple own apple.org
[07:30:30] <Cl0udNinja> being able to resolve assets from apples.com depends entirely on the websetup
[07:30:39] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Cl0udNinja: I will use www till the day I die
[07:30:41] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> lol
[07:31:02] <Cl0udNinja> and you can mess with your etc/hosts file to point www to a different location, but that wont prevent the redirect, you cant get around that as its built into the webservers config for that site
[07:31:02] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> won't type it in the address bar but my sites will redirect to the www version
[07:31:23] <Cl0udNinja> I go the other way. I make www redirect to non www
[07:31:25] <viva> So then we're at an impasse until leadership from each of these teams resolves this scope issue?
[07:31:36] <sd> 11<H​otmess> or your webserver has a redirect setup
[07:31:43] <sd> 11<H​otmess> its not just done with dns

[07:32:02] <Cl0udNinja> viva, likely, yes, you'll have to explain them this thing
[07:32:21] <viva> Cl0udNinja redirecting www to non www seems to be the popular thing to do now days but when i was doing side gigs for clients they would specifically complain about not being able to see the www in the address bar... most browsers hide it now days as well which makes situations like this even more frustrating!

[07:33:22] <Cl0udNinja> viva, yeah its all just redirect configs, but if they point to the same IP and physical path, they are exactly identical and www.apples.com/lolImaVirus.exe is the same as apples.com/lolImaVirus.exe

[07:36:26] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[07:36:31] <Cl0udNinja> of course it is
[07:36:38] <Cl0udNinja> why wouldnt you just host it all on the same server :D
[07:36:57] <viva> well what if you have a small web server and only 1 ip?
[07:37:01] <viva> how could you do it any other way?
[07:37:13] <Cl0udNinja> thats why theres a billion registrars and dns providers
[07:37:16] <viva> except for say, get rid of a NS ?
[07:38:32] <Cl0udNinja> I used to run my own everything for a number of years. I had my own dns, mail, web, some others
[07:39:04] <Cl0udNinja> I've just got my own web and mail now. I register my domains through an old work place, and host my DNS via linode

[18:23:45] <fritzwastaken> mornin lancehead 
[18:23:54] <lancehead> Any of you have experience running Raspbian in esxi? And if so, how the fuck did you get it working 
[18:23:58] <PublicWiFi> vinrock: thats my nickname for ur mum
[18:24:11] <PublicWiFi> can i ask why you're running raspbian in esxi
[18:24:17] <lancehead> You can
[18:24:34] <PublicWiFi> y tho
[18:24:36] *** Quits: Work-BWMerlin (~Work-BWMe@user/bwmerlin) (Quit: Client closed)
[18:24:43] *** Quits: Bluemedia4 (~Bluemedia@user/bluemedia) (Quit: Bluemedia4)
[18:24:43] <mjt> why would you even run esxi on a pi 
[18:24:52] <lancehead> esxi isnt running on the pi lol 
[18:24:54] <PublicWiFi> lol
[18:24:58] <lancehead> we have an esxi test server 
[18:25:02] <lancehead> and i have testing to do on raspbian 
[18:25:14] *** Joins: Bluemedia4 (~Bluemedia@user/bluemedia)
[18:25:22] <lancehead> somewhat... aggressive testing 
[18:25:25] <lancehead> so i can't use an actual pi 
[18:25:37] <PublicWiFi> pretty sure there's a raspbian x64 distro now right?
[18:25:43] <PublicWiFi> oh nvm
[18:25:47] <PublicWiFi> its just debian with a pi desktop skin
[18:25:56] <PublicWiFi> so im curious now
[18:26:01] <PublicWiFi> why can't you do aggressive testing on a pi :P
[18:26:06] <PublicWiFi> cause won't it eventually run on a pi?
[18:26:17] <lancehead> Because we use industrial pi's and if i accidentally brick one it's 600 eur gone 
[18:26:22] <lancehead> and i might do so, repeatedly 
[18:26:24] <PublicWiFi> can esxi even run ARM stuff?
[18:26:36] <lancehead> I have no idea, that's why i asked :D 
[18:27:09] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> There is an ESXi version for ARM, so...yes?
[18:27:18] <mjt> esxi on arm can run arm guests, but obviously not x86/x64 guests
[18:27:21] <PublicWiFi> oh i think esxi has an arm version
[18:27:23] <PublicWiFi> yeeee

[18:27:34] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> https://flings.vmware.com/esxi-arm-edition

[18:27:54] <lancehead> hm 
[18:27:59] <lancehead> yeah we just have enterprise plus 
[18:28:03] <lancehead> so no dice i think 
[18:28:05] <sd> 10<U​ID_Zero> Right, ESXi will not magically run cross-platform.
[18:28:06] <mjt> likewise esxi on x64 won't run arm guests (afaik)
[18:28:16] <lancehead> rip 
[18:28:20] <PublicWiFi> yeah nop
[18:28:22] <lancehead> guess i'm testing it on normal-ass debian
