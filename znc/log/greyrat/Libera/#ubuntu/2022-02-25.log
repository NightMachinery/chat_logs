[16:24:15] <rosaage> I have some weird problems with a USB camera and a hub. using python to stream the camera over http it randomly drops out and I have to restart it. running without the hub works fine. and running through the hub in windows worked fine after removing "allow windows to shutdown this device" on the hub. I have tried to disable autosuspend in ubuntu
[16:24:15] <rosaage> but I have no idea if it actually is disabled. my os version is 21.10. I just tested it in ffplay and it drops out there as well.

[16:37:08] <taholmes160> Hi Folks: When I first set up my ubuntu system, and was using the local screen, keyboard and mouse, the terminal window and nautilus both had really good looking themes on them. The machine is intended to run headless over the local area network and is accessed via RDC -- for some reason, the themes have vanished when I connect via RDC and the current ones are really ugly -- anyone know how I can

[21:57:06] <jhutchins> river: Your question is too broad.  If you're getting your connection configuration from DHCP, it usually includes default DNS servers.  If you're using Network Manager, either from the command line or the GUI, it has options to set static DNS.  If you're doing a completely old-school manual setup, it's all in the /etc/network/interface and /etc/resolv.conf files.
[21:57:45] <semitones> jhutchins, lol that's how this all started :) My cd player was sometimes playing it correctly and sometimes getting stuck, and I wasn't sure if it was the CD's fault or the player's fault ;)
