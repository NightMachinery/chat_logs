[00:00:50] <j416> rebase sees commits as patches, i.e. the diff between the commit and its parent
[00:01:07] <j416> so if you're after "I wish I made this change earlier", then rebase
[00:01:37] <texasmynsted> Then what is the point of graft?
[00:01:37] <j416> if you want "I'd like this exact state of my directories and files to be at this earlier point, without affecting the state the comes after it", then graft
[00:02:09] <texasmynsted> okay. Good explanation. Thank you. I need rebase.

[00:02:37] <j416> yes. grafting does not fit your use-case. use rebase or filter-branch.

[00:02:47] <j416> I don't want to recommend filter-repo but it seems popular.
[00:03:06] <texasmynsted> hm. Why not filter-repo?
[00:03:11] <j416> personal preference
[00:03:29] <j416> it does too many things in my opinion
[00:03:57] <texasmynsted> How is filter-branch an alternative to rebase.

[00:04:41] *** Quits: frm (~frm@user/frm) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[00:04:45] <j416> it has strange side-effects that are meant to .. I dunno, help the user. Like for example removing your remote so that you don't accidentally push the wrong thing to it.
[00:04:54] <j416> (it being filter-repo)
[00:05:11] <j416> if you can live with that, I bet it's fine.
[00:05:46] <texasmynsted> Yeah, I was planning to remove the remote before altering stuff anyway
[00:06:05] <texasmynsted> This is a fresh clone to /tmp/
[00:06:13] <j416> filter-branch iterates through commits and applies an action to each
[00:06:37] <j416> rebase resets to a point in time and applies patches on top of that
[00:07:00] <texasmynsted> rebase sounds more efficient for what I am doing
[00:07:01] <j416> filter-repo I think does much of the same things as filter-branch, with extra fluff.
[00:07:34] <texasmynsted> or maybe I just do not really know how to use filter-branch
[00:07:49] <j416> it depends on what you want.
[00:08:12] <j416> you said you're truncating history, if you're doing that anyway you might as well rebase it all
[00:08:45] <j416> note also that rebase, since it's applying commits as patches, will make you the committer of these commits and update the committer date
[00:09:23] <j416> I'd start with figuring out what you want, then go from there.

[00:10:29] <texasmynsted> I forgot about this part. I normally only use rebase in my own private branches

[00:17:58] <texasmynsted> It does not just remove files

[00:18:42] <texasmynsted> Changes code inline in various files.
[00:19:18] <j416> I suppose you could use them as patches and apply them to each commit after but
[00:19:23] <j416> then it sounds a lot like rebase
[00:19:53] <texasmynsted> Well I can not replace the developer name with my own.

[00:28:09] <j416> if you don't want the committer and comitter date to change, you can either reset it for each commit while rebasing, or, perhaps easier, use filter-branch to apply your patch to each commit
[00:28:42] <imMute> texasmynsted: remember that each commit records the author and committer (and dates of those two things) separately.
[00:29:09] <imMute> texasmynsted: when rebasing commits, the committer and commit timestamp will change, but the author/authorship date will stay the same.  IIRC stuff like git-blame look at author information, not committer

[14:34:57] <cc0> hi, i do "git checkout v0.1.2", which makes my head "detached at v0.1.2" (it's a tag). how can i programatically get the tag name that my current detached head points to? i can get the commit ref of the tag, but then it's hard to go back to the tag (can be ambiguous with other tags of the commit pointed to)
[14:35:04] <Nei> you could try GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -v" git fetch
[14:35:07] <Nei> maybe that shows some more
[14:35:57] <Nei> maybe "git describe --tags"
[14:36:50] <cc0> i have tagged  v0.1.0, v0.1.1, v0.1.2. on the same commit C. when i do git checkout v0.1.2, then "git describe --tags", git returns "v0.1.0"
[14:37:02] <cc0> instead of "v0.1.2"
[14:37:44] <Lope> does origin as a remote name have special meaning?
[14:37:49] <Lope> or is it just a default name?
[14:38:14] <Nei> it's the default yea
[14:38:19] <Lope> nei, my one remote is named github, the other is named bitbucket
[14:38:31] <Lope> so does git have no idea where to fetch from when I run `git fetch`

[14:39:08] <Nei> sure, I would also use such more descriptive names
[14:39:26] <Nei> if your current branch has an upstream git fetch will fetch that
[14:39:47] <Lope> well, I renamed my github remote to origin, and now when I run `git fetch` it actually works.
[14:39:59] <Lope> So I gues I was supposed to type `git fetch github`

[18:24:49] <gitinfo> [!sparse_checkout] Sparse checkout can be used to restrict which files/folders are updated with all checkout and status operations. It cannot change the tree the checkout is rooted from. One common use case is locally keeping Git from updating some of the files tracked in your repository.

[18:42:06] <lmat> Any time I make changes then run git push remote1;, local master is pushed to remote home-master. Then I ran  git push -u remote2 master:home-master; This overwrites the previous "set-upstream". How do I set multiple upstream "aliases" for a branch?

[20:38:24] <Matt|home> so i've got a source file in a git directory and it's a bit of a mess. since it's not that big yet, rather than making a ton of changes i can just create a new file and use that instead of the old one. my question is: if i delete the old file, can i go back and look at it at a later point in time, or will it eventually not be accessible from i guess git's commit history or whatever?
[20:39:49] <ikke> Matt|home: no, it will remain part of history

[20:42:27] * Lemuria hi?
[20:42:47] <Matt|home> yes hello.
[20:42:48] <OnlineCop> Matt|home: Sometimes, you may push files into a repo with secrets that you want to expunge. It's not impossible to remove that by rewriting history (force push), but otherwise, you can still see the original files with a `git log`.
[20:42:59] <Matt|home> alright.

[20:43:37] <DoofusCanadensis> yeah we got that
[20:43:38] <Lemuria> not git, ive been using it for a few months
[20:43:47] <avu> Lemuria: if you have a question about git, you are right here. If you just want to chat, ask alis for other channels.
[20:43:51] <Lemuria> is there a way for me to always gpg sign commits created with rebases
[20:43:56] <Lemuria> without specifying -S
[20:44:11] *** Joins: tewrvd^ (~tewrvd@64.253.22.77)
[20:44:23] <Lemuria> i'm unsure what git config setting to use
[20:44:38] <DoofusCanadensis> man git-config
[20:44:39] <gitinfo> the git-config manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-config.html
[20:45:27] <Lemuria> so when I rebase feature branches onto my dev branch, the commits arent signed even though my git config is set to always gpg sign all commits
[20:45:47] <DoofusCanadensis> commit.gpgSign might be relevant
[20:47:33] <DoofusCanadensis> push.gpgSign maybe?
[20:47:39] <Lemuria> i'll create a test repo and see
[20:47:47] <DoofusCanadensis> or an alias that adds -S to your rebase
