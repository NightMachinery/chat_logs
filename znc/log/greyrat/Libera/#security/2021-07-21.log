[00:04:59] <clarjon1> ipv5 design had same ipv4 limitations

[00:05:33] <Hash> If you look at them in binary, the five classes each correspond to a set of starting bits in the octet: 0, 10, 110, 1110, and 1111. It also makes it easy to see the size of each class by how many bits are remaining to assign. The five classes can have 128, 64, 32, 16, and 8 values respectively, adding up to the octet's total of 255.
[00:05:50] <Hash> Bloody binary to decimal octet conversion stuffs

[00:54:53] <Apachez> being able to NAT is a core function of a modern firewall
[00:54:59] <Apachez> heck even for a 25 year old firewall

[00:56:46] <Hash> well.
[00:56:51] <Apachez> if your firewall cannot do NAT then its not a firewall
[00:56:53] <Hash> Not all firewalls are stateful.

[00:57:10] <Hash> True
[00:57:36] <Apachez> you have basically four types of "firewalls"
[00:57:55] <Apachez> the simpliest one is "screening router"... just an ACL in a switch as an example... it doesnt keep states nor tracks anything useful

[00:58:49] <Apachez> nextup is SPI - stateful packet inspection... similar config as ACL (screening router) but with the huge difference that it also keeps states and by that also keep track of who initiated the flow etc... here are NAT capabilities included (they are sort of included once you do connection tracking)

[00:59:32] <Hash> True
[00:59:43] <Apachez> after that you have proxybased firewalls... similar to SPI with the main difference that it got one flow on one side and another flow on the other side for the same session... basically it unwraps the packets into a stream and on the other side wraps them again into the expected protocol
[00:59:52] <beanbag-> then again it's better than the horse shit they give you that is out of date in a week
[01:00:40] <Apachez> and finally you got NGFW - next generation firewall, mainly a buzzword but they are basically a SPI firewall but with the capabilities to also terminate SSL/TLS sessions on the fly, perform url categorization on http/https traffic, perform antivirus scanning of files flowing through etc
[01:00:45] <Hash> according to Gartner, a next-generation firewall is “a deep-packet inspection firewall that moves beyond port/protocol inspection and blocking to add application-level inspection, intrusion prevention and bringing intelligence from outside the firewall.”

[01:00:48] *** Quits: baw (~baw@user/baw) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[01:01:09] <Apachez> so out of these four types of firewalls its only the first ACL aka screening router who doesnt grasp the idea of NAT
[01:01:13] <beanbag-> I don't even understand the osi model and tcpip :/
[01:01:17] <Hash> Using ip lists to filter out people too
[01:01:18] <Apachez> since it doesnt have any memory set aside for that

[01:02:10] <Hash> Thanks for the lesson!
[01:02:12] * Hash is student
[01:02:25] <Apachez> a very cheap device can just do the simpliest thing and look at srcip, dstip, srcport, dstport and throw away packets who doesnt match the ACL (or the other way around only let those who fits the ACL pass and the rest to get dropped)
[01:02:48] <Apachez> another difference is that a screening router is by default "allow all" if you didnt setup any acl

[01:03:07] <Apachez> same with the last hidden ace in the acl is an "allow any"
[01:03:24] <Apachez> while spi, proxy and ngfw all are default deny aka the last hidden rule is "deny any"
[01:03:38] <Hash> I like the white list only approach
[01:03:50] <Hash> blacklist all be default, and white only what you need.
[01:04:38] <Apachez> yeah thats the more sane approach... default deny and then have as tight fit as possible on what you allow through
[01:04:52] <Apachez> for larger deployements you often combine them
[01:04:59] <Hash> *nod*
[01:05:06] <Hash> multi tier security approach
[01:05:14] <Hash> Learned that in last course
[01:05:21] <Apachez> like first a set of blacklists (bad ip's etc, why spend cpu cycles on something that you would drop later on anyway?), then whitelist and finally default deny
[01:05:38] <Apachez> and same goes with the types you use
[01:06:00] <Apachez> normally you will have a layer of switches anyway outside of your clustered firewalls (spi/proxy/ngfw)
[01:06:11] <Apachez> so let the switches do the heavy lifting of the first cut
[01:06:22] <Apachez> then let the firewalls spend their cpu cycles on the details
[01:06:41] *** Quits: Torr (~Torr@user/torr) (Quit: leaving)
[01:06:46] <Apachez> one drawback with such approach if the first ACLs are too narrow is that the firewalls wont detect portscannings etc
[01:07:19] <Apachez> like lets say instead of first ACL being just "allow dstip=<your iprange>" it is instead "allow dstip=<webserver> dstport=80"
[01:07:48] <Apachez> in the first case if someone portscans lets say your webserver than all packets will hit the firewall who then will detect a scan and perhaps temp block the ip or however you might have it configured
[01:08:03] *** Joins: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech)
[01:08:29] <Apachez> while in the later case only pakcets with webserverip + dstport=80 will hit the firewall, everything else is filterered by the ACLs in the switchlayer before it... so the portscan packets will never reach the firewall
[01:08:36] <beanbag-> I assume spi protects against spoofing
[01:08:47] <beanbag-> which is why you want it over acl
[01:08:49] <beanbag-> ?
[01:08:52] <Hash> Not really
[01:09:03] <Apachez> SPI keeps track of direction
[01:09:15] <Apachez> aka state
[01:09:34] <Apachez> even if udp technically doesnt have a state in a SPI fw it will have a virtual state as in which direction the packet was first seen
[01:09:48] <Hash> So it keeps tracks of hops
[01:09:51] <Hash> that's interesting.
[01:09:59] <Apachez> no
[01:10:02] <Hash> I didn't know that it kept track of the path a packet takes.
[01:10:04] <Apachez> direction aka states

[01:10:15] <Apachez> a tcp connection have like a 3 way handshake to setup a connection
[01:10:15] <Hash> Then how can it differenciate a spoofed packet from a valid real packet?
[01:10:23] <Apachez> first packet is SYN in A -> B direction
[01:10:30] <Apachez> 2nd packet is a SYN+ACK in B -> A direction
[01:10:33] <Hash> Then B-A then A-B
[01:10:35] <Hash> Right
[01:10:41] <Apachez> finally there is a ACK in A -> B direction
[01:10:52] <Apachez> now the 3way handshake is complete and both hosts have a socket
[01:11:10] <Hash> But how can an SPI tell a packet apart from real source vs. spoofed source
[01:11:14] <Apachez> they know srcip, dstip, srcport, dstport and a counter (to keep track of data that have been sent)

[01:11:23] <Hash> The purpose of spoofing is to trick it into thinking it's from a valid source.
[01:11:32] <Apachez> so without spi the above can be dealt in an acl such as:
[01:11:37] <Hash> So unless it can keep track of the hops and where a packet path was, how can it tell apart ?
[01:11:52] <Apachez> srcip:any srcport:>1023 dstip:x.x.x.x dstport:80
[01:11:56] <Apachez> for A->B
[01:12:03] <Apachez> but returning traffic will be

[01:12:30] <Apachez> so why is this bad?
[01:12:59] <Hash> You're describing basic port forwarding? I got confused somewhgere in the middle
[01:13:12] <Apachez> well now the webserver whoever can start an app that uses srcport 80 that through this switch (with ACL) speak to the whole internet due to dstip:any dstport:>1023  (whole internet as long as destination port is larger than 1023 that is 1024-65535)
[01:13:21] <Apachez> no, no port forwarding

[01:13:27] <Hash> I see
[01:13:50] <Hash> I thought you were sending 80 to 1023

[01:14:16] <Apachez> which also means that the ACL wont be able to know if its return traffic or a new session
[01:14:36] <Apachez> but with SPI we have a connection tracking table that keeps track of the states of each flow
[01:14:53] <Apachez> so in short we will allow packets where SYN is set only in A->B direction
[01:15:10] <Apachez> but if the webserver on its own attempt to speak to the internet dstport:>1023 using srcport:80 it will be dropped
[01:15:33] <Apachez> because we only allow A->B to setup a connection (for dstport 80)
[01:15:39] <Apachez> but not B -> A
[01:16:01] <Apachez> however we will accept reply (return) traffic for a session that we allowed in A->B direction
[01:16:26] <Apachez> A (srcport >1023) -> B (dstport 80) ACCEPT
[01:17:18] <Apachez> means that for this given session B will from srcport 80 be able to reply back to A at whatever dstport (srcport >1023 in the above line) it was using as a srcport previously
[01:18:34] <Apachez> lets take an example using UDP instead if you are still around? :P
[01:18:48] <Apachez> there is a protocol named TFTP which uses udp port 69 as dstport
[01:18:53] <Hash> I see
[01:18:59] <Hash> Lots of info
[01:19:04] <Apachez> now udp on its own doesnt have any states
[01:19:13] <Hash> Currently my chapter is on stateful/stateless protocols
[01:19:18] <Apachez> compared to tcp who have the syn, ack, fin, psh, rst etc flags
[01:19:36] <Apachez> but with a spi firewall the spi fw can setup a virtual state even for udp flows
[01:19:50] <Apachez> based on which interface it arrived at and which interface its supposed to egress at
[01:19:55] <Apachez> and if you will allow that traffic
[01:20:11] <Apachez> and based on that within x num of seconds you will accept return traffic in the opposite direction
[01:20:26] <Apachez> like a TFTP client connects to TFTP server and download a file
[01:21:02] <Hash> BRB
[01:21:03] <Apachez> so if dstport 69 is seen in A->B direction then B->A will be able to reply within x num of seconds (normally 60 or so)
[01:21:46] <Apachez> but outside this window the flow is destroyed in the conntrack table so a packet that have a pause for 61 seconds and then is sent B->A will get dropped by the firewall
[01:22:03] <Apachez> compared to a ACL (screening router) who would have these holes open permanently
[01:22:24] <Apachez> meaning suddently the server could start to speak to the world instead of just waiting for incoming connections

[02:25:51] <soulisson> Hash, imo (some might disagree) the content for the Security+ certification is a good start to get the concepts of security. You could then search for defensive courses on incident response, forensics, malware analysis, ...

[02:29:32] <soulisson> whether something was hacked or not can be a matter of semantics. The fact is that an XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain access to restricted areas of your application.

[02:36:43] <Hash> Cybersecurity, Cloud, and Networking offer the best (most valuable and useful) certifications out of all the programs. CCSP/SSCP, Amazon AWS, and CCNA are all extremely valuable and useful in their respective plans. I think the reason these are so good compared to the other programs is mostly because ISC(2), Microsoft/Amazon, and Cisco have completely dominated their respective areas, so their
[02:36:45] <Hash> certs are worth that much more.
[02:37:21] <Hash> The uselessness of CompTIA, CIW, and EC-Council certifications cannot be overstated. They're there because they're cheap and convenient ways to "add value" to the plan while still checking your understanding of the material. CompTIA Linux+ and Security+ are the only exceptions. HR may think they're fancy, but no employer will care.

[05:43:37] <mats1> its a common practice to put printers and mysterymeat devices on vlans and restrict them from dialing out

[19:12:44] <TheLinuxNerd> and I'm clearing all shadow copies that have SAM copied from the before the permission fix
[19:12:47] <TheLinuxNerd> no need to disable
[19:12:52] <TheLinuxNerd> the vulnerability is fixed
[19:12:56] <skill> TheLinuxNerd: yup, seems reasonable
[19:13:19] <skill> I wonder if windows defender/other EDRs will now begin to track access to those paths.
[19:13:36] <TheLinuxNerd> skill they'll probably push a KB update to run the commands
[19:13:48] <TheLinuxNerd> and change the files in every shadow copy
[19:14:15] <skill> yeah
[19:14:30] <skill> lol, i wonder how this happens internally. Did someone disable the regression test to check for perms?
[19:14:51] <TheLinuxNerd> no, this was in every windows till now
[19:15:10] <skill> the change was introduced in windows 10 1809
[19:15:20] <skill> seems like a regression issue.
