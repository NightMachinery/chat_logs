[00:09:29] <nova> the { }& is not noise. it backgrounds so script doesn't block

[05:16:26] <phogg> not better, just for different purposes

[05:17:14] <phogg> nobody really needs anything other than a while loop, but other kinds of loops sure are nice

[05:23:58] <ted-ious> I see.
[05:24:09] <greycat> The thing is, you are looping over the lines of a file.  You don't know in advance how many there are.  So a for loop is not the right kind of loop.  You want a while read loop.
[05:24:43] <ted-ious> I actually do know the number of lines in advance but I get your point.
[05:25:17] <ted-ious> Is this i++ syntax portable to vanilla bourne or korn shell or is it bash only?

[12:17:28] <earnestly> kurahaupo: Although as a different meaning
[12:17:49] <kurahaupo>  /etc/alternatives is an abomination that assumes a computing device has only a single user, and that that user only wants a single environment.
[12:17:59] <earnestly> Modern use of EDITOR, like BROWSER, is just to serve the need that people have different preferences and instead of using scripts people decided to use environments, sigh

[12:19:16] <earnestly> kurahaupo: No one cares about VISUAL or that distinction anymore.  EDITOR hasn't meant a line editor for decades
[12:19:42] <earnestly> I.e. vi is not an 'EDITOR'
[12:20:03] <kurahaupo> A visual editor is an acceptable implementation of a CLI editor

[12:20:31] *** Quits: gordonfish (~gordonfis@user/gordonfish) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[12:20:56] <kurahaupo> It's always been acceptable to set EDITOR=vi
[12:20:59] <earnestly> VISUAL is vi, anything that could be implemented on a non-block mode terminal
[12:21:08] <earnestly> kurahaupo: Exactly, it means nothing anymore
[12:21:11] <earnestly> It's just a preference marker
[12:22:43] <earnestly> So they have history but there is no connection between how they're used now and their origin.  Iow, the story ended and a new one started, but they used the same terms so people get confused
[12:22:54] <kurahaupo> It's never been particularly clear how the invoker would choose to use EDITOR instead of VISUAL; vi switches to ex mode if it's on a hardcopy terminal. So if it "changed" it was some time before 1985

[16:13:31] <yuri6037> execve needs splitting
[16:13:59] <yuri6037> execve requires the direct binary path so splitting is needed. But you did not answer my question?
[16:14:13] <kurahaupo> so you do execve("/bin/sh", "-c", "the command with spaces here", 0) ??

[16:15:57] <kurahaupo> Either do space splitting OR preface sh -c NOT BOTH
[16:16:22] <geirha> in what way does sudo "support joining"?
[16:16:29] <kurahaupo> No sudo does NOT support joining. It passed the arg vrctor through unchanged
[16:16:31] <yuri6037> is there a way to tell sh or bash or another shell to do joining?

[16:17:09] <kurahaupo> yuri6037: Stop trying to join. You don't need to split in the first place

[16:18:42] <yuri6037> geirha: I know sudo does not use sh -c
[16:19:16] <kurahaupo> possible point of confusion: su -c does use sh -c
[16:20:34] <yuri6037> It's just that because sudo is able to take commands without quotes I though sh or bash would be capable of doing the same but I guess no
[16:20:46] <geirha> there is also some magic involved with sudo -s and -i as it has to spawn a shell with those options, so it will add shell quotes and inject into the shell
[16:21:10] <wwilliam> Soliton: Is there any possibility to include also the recon file for the group in the subdir?
[16:21:36] <geirha> yuri6037: they can.   execve("sh","-c","\"$@\"", "scriptname", "some", "command","with","spaces")
[16:21:49] <geirha> but at that point, the shell serves no purpose, so you might as well omit it
[16:21:52] <kurahaupo> yuri6037: sh scriptfilename script args here
[16:21:52] <kurahaupo> OR sh -c "script contents here" scriptident script args here

[21:24:39] <pystardust> ifohancroft: look at sxhkd, there are other keyboard daemons too(your wm/de would have one inbuilt), they run a specific command with keypresses
[21:25:22] <pystardust> if u want the script to start in the terminal you cold do ` <terminal-name> <script> `
[21:25:40] <ifohancroft> pystardust: so I can make the keyboard daemon pass the next key pressed to the shell script?
[21:26:28] <ifohancroft> To clarify since I suck at explaining and my question might have not been clear. I am not asking if I can execute a shell script from a key combo. I am asking if a shell script executed from a key combo can access the next key I press after its execution
[21:26:29] <pystardust> ifohancroft: ahh, well not directly but you could, with signals
[21:27:36] <ifohancroft> How would I do it with signals?

[21:28:42] <pystardust> There might be a better way that this, but I suppose you can store the key being pressed in a text file and signal the script, when the script recieves the signal it would read the file to know which key was pressed and parses it

[21:30:04] <ifohancroft> I am sorry if I am missing something but how would I get the key in the text file in the first place?
[21:31:09] <pystardust> using a keyboard daemon, like sxhkd.
[21:31:38] <ifohancroft> Thank you! Let me look into that
[21:31:51] <pystardust> Also you could directly signal an integer to the script with the kill command (from the keyboard daemon), take a look at this bar script for example trap	"update_backlight;display" 	"RTMIN+1"
[21:31:58] <pystardust> https://github.com/pystardust/sbar/blob/master/sbar#L62
[21:32:46] <pystardust> here for instance, I change the brightness of the bar when ever I update it, (so in my keyboard daemon , as I change the brightness I signall the script to update)

[21:39:20] <Soliton> right, you're not signalling sleep. makes sense.
[21:39:21] <ifohancroft> pystardust: do you happen to know what keyboard daemon does MATE use? I am guessing it's something of theirs and bundled with something else. Is it perhaps in mate-session?

[23:10:29] <geirha> such silence
[23:10:34] <earnestly> -s still prints diagnostic messages
[23:10:40] <earnestly> But ikr :(
[23:11:15] <geirha> vim's ex is silent though
[23:11:22] <earnestly> It's funny that my example also used 'foo'
[23:11:24] <geirha> shbot has vi's
[23:11:41] <earnestly> I have vi as well
[23:11:52] <earnestly> exvi anyway
[23:12:25] <earnestly> geirha: Oddly with exvi, ex without -s prints nothing
[23:12:44] <earnestly> # printf foo > file; ex -cwq file
[23:12:45] <shbot> earnestly: "file" [Incomplete last line] 1 line, 3 characters
[23:12:45] <shbot> earnestly: "file" 1 line, 4 characters
[23:12:49] <earnestly> Hm
[23:13:11] <earnestly> I get a screen flash, it might be trying to use vi... lol
[23:13:39] <earnestly> Yeah, it's doing tty detection, sigh.  Sticking it in a pipe gets me those messages
[23:14:07] <earnestly> geirha: that it prints  [Incomplete last line] without a newline smells like a bug
[23:15:03] <earnestly> # printf foo > file; ex -scwq file | od -An -c # it's also on stdout, so it's probably a bug

[23:18:35] <earnestly> Yeah, it's a code path that doesn't check if (hush == 0)
[23:18:52] <earnestly> The other cases where it prints such things is guarded by that if statement, just an oversight
[23:19:16] <geirha> and it probably hasn't been maintained for 20 years
[23:19:44] <ifohancroft> Soliton: Thank you! I figured it out I think. Apparently there are even multiple ways to achieve it with sxhkd. I can either call a shell script passing it a parameter depending on the key pressed and call the screenshot tool with the desired options depending on the parameter the shell script got, or I can assign a key combo to the screenshot tool directly, giving the tool different options
[23:19:46] <ifohancroft> depending on the pressed key

[23:20:14] *** Joins: rickame (~rickame@user/rickame)
[23:20:35] <rickame> is echo -en '\n' best syntax for inserting blank line to shell?
[23:20:47] <geirha> no, use printf '\n'
[23:20:49] <earnestly> geirha: They have added multibyte but there's no clear place for bug reports so it probably is just crystalised
[23:20:54] <geirha> !echo
[23:20:54] <greybot> echo outputs a string. echo has many portability problems, and should never be used with option flags. Consider printf instead: printf 'name: %s\n' "$name". http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/builtin/echo | http://cfajohnson.com/shell/cus-faq.html#Q0b | http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/echo+printf
