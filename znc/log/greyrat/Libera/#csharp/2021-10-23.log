[04:44:37] <lz_> but I'd need a new pc to do this

[04:47:38] <entropygain> :rofl:
[04:49:03] <entropygain> prostitution sounds more dangerous than stripping
[04:49:09] <entropygain> just my 2 cents
[04:51:02] <entropygain> damn dre_ that is an interesting read lol
[04:51:28] <lz_> 1200 holy shit
[04:51:33] <lz_> I could have a new pc in 1h
[04:51:54] <dre_> someone should do that thing where they moan over the phone or whatever, but it's just programmers calling each other while writing code

[09:13:47] <dre_> so; if I have a game loop; bunch of game objects run a void Update() method.
[09:14:34] <dre_> in the units, I have a functiuon effectively along the lines of "HasFinishedProcessingCommands() : bool"
[09:15:15] <dre_> if it hasn't finished, it will return false; so all the gameobjects get called update(); again. Up until it returns true; which means this game object has finished, and so other things are done, etc........
[09:15:20] <dre_> my question is this:
[09:16:33] <dre_> if I am setting up an async function that "for(x) { /*do stuff*/ await Task.Delay(100);}" so that I can repeatedly do stuff every 10th of a second
[09:16:52] <dre_> how can I make the calling code test if the async task has finished?
[09:17:11] <dre_> do i have to store it in a variable, then test if .Result doesn't throw an exception?
[09:17:14] <dre_> that seems dumb to me

[10:46:01] <dre_> my workplace works exclusively off force pushes
[10:46:31] <dre_> can anyone tell me if there's a nice way to check an async Task for the parameters it was previously initiated with?
[10:47:45] <Jong> exclusively off force pushes!?
[10:47:55] <Jong> on branches, or the main branch?
[10:49:36] <dre_> on branches; force push it how you want; if gotta fix up things; then force push those commits and amends and etc. then merge with master.
[10:50:23] <dre_> we try to work off clear commit histories, so sometimes you'll have to go back and break up commits or something, and force push the entire branch so that it's updated to how you want it
[10:50:56] <gufi> force push should never be required
[10:51:01] <gufi> unless some one managed to fuck up bad
[10:51:25] <dre_> gufi, what if you need to write a more explicit commit message?
[10:51:39] <dre_> also how's my C# skills? https://imgur.com/YOCqVKB
[10:51:43] <gufi> put that info in the pull request
[10:51:53] <gufi> we have force push disabled almost entirely
[10:52:05] <MatthiasVance> dre_: Hm
[10:52:07] <dre_> gufi, that info is lost once the PR is merged
[10:52:28] <gufi> most info is lost on squashed merges anyway
[10:52:33] <dre_> like it's in the PR sure, but it's not in the actual commit / code, so editors can't see it; you'd have to go to the PR to figure it out
[10:52:53] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I think this is what GH does badly
[10:53:04] <gufi> with a proper merge commit it commits the PR message if it can for us
[10:53:07] <MatthiasVance> It should just commit the discription as well
[10:53:18] <MatthiasVance> ah right it does when merging
[10:53:47] <dre_> ah ye i didn't know that; kinda moot point anyway; irregardless we try to enforce atomic commits, etc.
[10:54:12] <dre_> like no individual commit should fail CI; sometimes you have to fix up a specific commit that's already pushed; so update it and force push etc;
[10:54:28] <gufi> wasted effort
[10:54:37] * gufi commits partial code all the time 
[10:54:47] <MatthiasVance> yeah
[10:54:55] <MatthiasVance> especially when you're on a feature branch
[10:54:58] <gufi> commit small commit often, a commit does not need to be required as even buildable code
[10:55:21] <MatthiasVance> dre_: In your explanation, is an individual commit a PR merge, or a commit inside a feature branch?
[10:55:31] <MatthiasVance> For the former, I totally agree, PR should be pre-built and tested

[10:56:32] <gufi> if they do ff merges people  might
[10:56:40] <dre_> no, everyone sees every commit; they don't get squash merged afaik
[10:56:59] <dre_> I don't actually know a lot of git, I just know that we have to have clean consistent commit histories;
[10:57:13] <dre_> and it helps when *I'm* looking through code and check out the blame history
[10:57:14] <MatthiasVance> Oh you don't squash PRs??
[10:57:27] <MatthiasVance> You are going to end up with so many useless commits then
[10:57:40] <dre_> MatthiasVance, with your style of commits, yes.
[10:57:53] <MatthiasVance> It's a lot of extra work, what do you get in return?
[10:57:57] <gufi> yea. i prefer the entire feature branch to end up a single commit because the end result is what matters
[10:58:41] <gufi> i dont need to see "added properties xyz for abc feature" when there is an issue with the actual logic
[10:58:44] <dre_> we get the history of how the code was developed; when we look at a specific line of code, we can see the commit history explaining what it is doing
[10:58:59] <MatthiasVance> dre_: You can see that specific line of code with squashed PR as well
[10:59:08] <MatthiasVance> It almost sounds as if your PRs are super big
[10:59:27] <gufi> yea, pretty much same thing but if you had 30 commits end result is with 1 that describes that feature as implemented and not individual small commits
[10:59:56] <MatthiasVance> I really want to understand your POV :D
[11:00:24] <dre_> guys I'm sorry I would like to explain but I'm trying to figure out how to do trivial c# code
[11:00:33] <dre_> and I've got to finish this over the weekend :P
[11:01:15] <dre_> <MatthiasVance> dre_: You can see that specific line of code with squashed PR as well
[11:01:23] *** Joins: Booster2ooo (~Booster2o@user/booster2ooo)
[11:01:38] <dre_> isn't squashed PR merge when it's all squashed down to one commit and committed as "Merged PR #12341"
[11:02:02] <dre_> wouldn't it be a case where if you looked at Git blame you'd just see everyone do "Merged PR #1231254254" instead of the actual commits?
[11:02:45] <gufi> our messages end up as "TEAMNAME-PR# Title of feature - explanation of all involved"
[11:03:10] <gufi> err not PR number Feature#
[11:04:24] <dre_> so if the PR had a refactor that leads to a feature implementation, you'd never know the reasoning behind the refactoring ( other than it was used to implement feature?)
[11:04:25] <dre_> :P
[11:05:20] <gufi> yea because no one cares that you refactored  in 6 months, they care what feature was the cause of the issue
[11:09:37] <dre_> ah, perhaps my work is more mission critical then.
[11:10:20] <dre_> I'm joking btw :P

[16:56:22] <MatthiasVance> Apparently we're going to get an apocalypse on sunday? :P
[16:56:46] <MatthiasVance> gpsd has a bug and things running a recent version will now have a time that's 20 years ago
[16:57:11] <MatthiasVance> Critical Infrastructure (CI) owners and operators, and other users who obtain Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) from Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, should be aware of a GPS Daemon (GPSD) bug in GPSD versions 3.20 (released December 31, 2019) through 3.22 (released January 8, 2021).
[16:57:11] <MatthiasVance>  
[16:57:11] <MatthiasVance> On October 24, 2021, Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers using bugged GPSD versions 3.20-3.22 may rollback the date 1,024 weeks—to March 2002—which may cause systems and services to become unavailable or unresponsive.
