[17:10:16] <xx> anyone in here with write access to https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa ? It still refers to freenode.
[17:14:00] <rob0> plaisthos, thanks, I keep getting sidetracked, but maybe I'll try it today. :)
[17:14:43] <rob0> ecrist_: ^^ do you have github easy-rsa write access?
[17:15:16] <rob0> xx, surely someone does, thanks for the report.
[17:15:41] <xx> there already is a PR in the repo for it https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/pull/450 but it is incomplete
[17:16:53] <xx> looks like there are a lot of open PRs in that repo
[17:17:02] <rob0> I think when this channel was created, there was a hope and belief that freenode was going to continue functioning.

[18:24:38] <plaisthos> IIrc ecrist_ stepped down as a the main maintainer but we don't really have new main maintainer, so easy-rsa is currently kind of in a limbo state
[18:27:58] <xx> that's a pity, but at least all it would take is to have someone with write access do at least a brief review of some of the PRs and merge them
[18:28:07] <xx> no real development is really necessary right now
[18:48:47] <plaisthos> xx: yes but I cannot do that since I am not familar with easy-rsa code at all
