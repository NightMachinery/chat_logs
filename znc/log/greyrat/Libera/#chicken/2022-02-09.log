[04:36:17] <ASau> Zipheir: no, the article misses the whole point. It is just another rant of person who do not understand the thing.
[04:38:25] <Zipheir> On reflection, I did find it and the related article somewhat unclear.
[04:41:31] <ASau> It is just another rant how "monopolies make liberal values fail".
[04:41:47] <ASau> Yet it is exactly the point of "liberal values".
[04:42:02] <ASau> It turns out that it was known from the very beginning.
[04:42:30] <ASau> I don't remember reference, yet even back in 17th or 18th century (times of J. Swift?)
[04:42:40] <ASau> some English were writing it in open that monopoly is the thing they want,
[04:42:49] <ASau> because it is the most effective way to earn money.
[04:44:33] <ASau> And all that "free trade" and other things that are known today as "liberalism" exist and are meant for _them_ to trade free, when they succede.
[04:46:00] <ASau> When they fail, see Anglo-Dutch wars, Opium wars and all the rest.

[09:49:50] <mario-goulart> jcroisant: that's cute.  I've copied those files to http://call-cc.org/img/icons/hint.svg and http://call-cc.org/img/icons/warning.svg (HTTPS works too).  References to those files in the wiki can done without the protocol specification (e.g., //call-cc.org/img/icons/hint.svg).
[09:51:01] <mario-goulart> Regarding support in svnwiki-sxml, the egg author (Jim) should be contacted.  I think it would be a nice addition.

[10:45:27] <sjamaan> mario-goulart: Why not just commit them into SVN?  Or does that not work for some reason?
[10:59:06] <sjamaan> (but then perhaps you can put it in the infrastructure git repo)
[11:00:28] <mario-goulart> sjamaan: I think svn is indeed the best option.
[11:00:50] <sjamaan> We do something like that for the image on the index wiki page, IIRC
[11:01:09] <mario-goulart> Right.
[11:02:05] <mario-goulart> I'm gonna add the files to svn later.  jcroisant: expect the files to be moved to svn.  I'll ping you later, after I move them.
[11:02:32] <mario-goulart> Have to go now. bbl.

[11:45:23] <fantazo> why is chicken still clinging to R5RS? any reasons? historical? prettiness of the standard?
[11:55:25] <sjamaan> Mostly practical reasons - we already had a module system, there's a lot of code out there using it, and R7RS works fine as an egg
[11:55:51] <sjamaan> Turning everything inside out just to make it speak "native" R7RS is just needless churn
[11:56:02] <sjamaan> Besides, it might break existing pure R5RS code
[11:56:39] <sjamaan> (and we already had a shitload of churn to make the layout of our modules saner)

[12:08:03] <sjamaan> (in 5.3.0)
[12:08:43] <s-liao> Okay. let me try one more time.
[12:11:56] <s-liao> Yes. it works. that REPL have been running a few stuff evaluate . When start a new REPL, it works.

[15:07:02] <mario-goulart> Hmm.  I wonder what happens in chickadee if egg documentation points to files in svn.  On a second thought maybe it is better to have them available via http and add them to the chicken-infrastructure repo.
[15:09:21] <mario-goulart> I.e., http://call-cc.org/img/icons/hint.svg would be available for users.  The hint.svg on the filesystem of the server would be a symlink to hint.svg in the copy of chicken-instrastucture.

[21:44:34] <jcroisant> mario-goulart: Images in the wiki svn can also be accessed by URL like //wiki.call-cc.org/icons/hint.svg. I guess it's a question of whether you want traffic to go to call-cc.org or wiki.call-cc.org, and whether there are other advantages or disadvantages to storing them in svn
[21:58:30] <jcroisant> chickadee will need additional work to make this work anyway. Right now I am using a hack with <table> and <img>, and chickadee strips out the <img> tag, so it doesn't show there anyway.

[22:36:05] <mario-goulart> jcroisant: URLs would work, yes.  But I mean people would be able to reference image files by using relative paths in wiki pages, and that would probably make the interaction with chickadee harder.
