[00:00:01] <causative_> partially about what rules would benefit you personally
[00:00:08] <biys> JBP talks about this with Panksepp and the rat tickler
[00:00:34] <causative_> I said all this before
[00:01:25] <causative_> in fact I began by talking about my childhood ideas about morality, by talking about what I was told rather than my natural inclinations
[00:01:35] <causative_> that was the point of describing my childhood ideas about right and wrong with respect to correct grammar
[00:01:46] <biys> it got lost in translation
[00:01:50] <biys> beg your pardon
[00:02:37] <causative_> i.e. that as a child I was taught certain grammatical constructions were right and some were wrong, and I approached this with a similar attitude to ideas about stealing or lying being wrong
[00:02:51] <causative_> until later I matured and acquired a larger perspective on all of that
[00:03:05] <causative_> and none of it was religious, was the original point
[00:03:08] <causative_> I was not raised religious
[00:03:10] <I_Am_M00t> biys: are you trying to say that sense of right and wrong transcends biology?
[00:03:46] <I_Am_M00t> is this the topic here?
[00:03:50] <biys> you don't have to be raised religiously to have religious ideas introduced to you though
[00:03:55] <biys> which is why i asked which came first
[00:03:57] <biys> the chicken or the egg
[00:04:17] <causative_> they weren't presented as religious
[00:04:27] <causative_> the "golden rule" is very widespread in many different cultures
[00:04:44] <causative_> every culture doesn't like liars or killers in normal circumstances
[00:05:03] <biys> arguable
[00:05:04] <causative_> these ideas are not owned by Judeo-Christian culture; they are omnipresent in humanity
[00:05:23] <biys> i would say that judeo-chritians is the latest rendition of these ideas
[00:05:27] <biys> not the culmination or these ideas
[00:05:27] <causative_> the ideas spread because they are effective means of organizing society, not because God said so
[00:05:52] <causative_> and really, "God said so" because the person who was saying what God said decided to put in his own (the writer's) pre-existing ideas of right and wrong
[00:06:11] <biys> well.  whatever "God" is

[00:07:02] <biys> i would say there are others
[00:07:25] <biys> i won't limit the potential to what we as humans know/experience
[00:08:03] <I_Am_M00t> biys: is the topic that sense of right and wrong transcends biology?
[00:08:15] <biys> uh... no
[00:08:42] <biys> i don't think that the idea of right and wrong is biological in nature at all
[00:08:46] <biys> i think it's a construct
[00:09:12] <I_Am_M00t> but it does exist in some "domain"? even if not biological?
[00:09:18] <biys> if it's biological in nature we'd also have to suggest that it's also a result of evolution
[00:09:22] <biys> which wouldn't make it absolute in any sense
[00:09:47] <biys> i think it exists in so far as we make it exist
[00:09:54] <causative_> it's a result of evolution and culture, to which we apply *reason*
[00:10:08] <biys> ^ based on our understanding
[00:10:10] <biys> current understanding
[00:10:19] <causative_> we start with raw notions held for pragmatic reasons, often bad reasons, and then we try to clean them up and make them consistent using our reason
[00:10:30] <biys> sure
[00:10:45] <biys> i could agree to that
[00:10:52] <causative_> the reason is the important step - reason is what makes us people, instead of animals guided by a leash
[00:11:02] <biys> do rats have reason?
[00:11:06] <causative_> not like we do
[00:11:14] <I_Am_M00t> why not? lol
[00:11:35] <I_Am_M00t> rats are little conscious beings too? just less "complex" in complexity
[00:11:42] <causative_> sure, they're conscious
[00:11:46] <causative_> don't need reason to be conscious
[00:11:56] <biys> do white blood cells have reason?
[00:12:02] <causative_> no
[00:12:50] <I_Am_M00t> let's just get to it, Does reason exist? :o)
[00:12:59] <causative_> rats can't reason abstractly - no animal can reason abstractly except humans (well, some animals can arguably reason abstractly a *little bit*, but not anything like humans can)
[00:15:42] *** Joins: yanmaani (~yanmaani@gateway/tor-sasl/yanmaani)
[00:16:14] <biys> i think the question i have is...  would you still have the ideas you have about right and wrong if the concepts/ideas hadn't been studied to the extent they had prior your existence?
[00:16:28] <biys> lets say these ideas were in their infancy
[00:16:37] <biys> and not well established in any ways, constructed
[00:16:46] <biys> or better yet
[00:16:53] <biys> you were born in a vacuum
[00:16:56] <causative_> no, of course if I were born in a different time I would have different ideas
[00:17:07] <causative_> because my power of reason is not infinite
[00:17:17] <biys> lets say you were born in a differen geographical location that upheld different ideas entirely
[00:17:22] <causative_> but that's not what matters
[00:17:24] <biys> not judeo-christian concepts
[00:17:44] <biys> that is more or less what i'm saying here
[00:17:49] <biys> you can't throw the baby out with the bath water
[00:18:15] <biys> a lot of the structural underpinning of your ideas of right and wrong aren't as a result of your own conscious thought
[00:18:16] <causative_> what matters is, suppose there are 2 mes:  2nd century AD me, and modern day me.  Suppose they get together and hash out their ideas between each other for a thousand years.  I think that eventually they would start to agree on things; they would trace back what they believe to base premises, and then question those premises
[00:18:22] <biys> they're as a result of the structure and system you were born into
[00:18:27] <causative_> they would be able to perform a process of elenchus to reconcile their different views
[00:18:59] <biys> and you think it would all come back to biology?
[00:19:02] <causative_> so 2nd century AD me would think lots of things that modern day me would consider very wrong, and vice versa; but if we talked and reasoned for long enough, using reason, we would come to agree
[00:20:02] <causative_> I would say things like "but you only think that because so-and-so told you, not for a good reason" and he'd say the same to me about people in my life, and we'd both agree that simply being told something is not a great reason to believe it
[00:20:08] <biys> you'd come to agree that there is a more or less accurate way to live/act within the universe?
[00:20:20] <biys> and these ideas, you believe, would transcend time and space?
[00:20:26] <causative_> and we'd try to work out what we really ought to believe, for as good reasons as we can come up with
[00:20:39] <biys> interesting
[00:20:39] <causative_> yes, a more or less "rational" way to live
[00:21:03] <causative_> reason is timeless
[00:21:12] <biys> yikes
[00:21:26] <biys> the ability to reason is timeless
[00:21:34] <biys> idk if "the reason" is timeless
[00:21:47] <causative_> the ability to reason depends on the time
[00:21:58] <biys> i would say reason depends on the time
[00:22:00] <causative_> present-day me has much greater ability to reason than 2nd century AD me would have
[00:22:08] <causative_> but reason itself is the same - like mathematics is the same
[00:22:11] <biys> i don't think so
[00:22:18] <biys> you'd still have the ability to reason
[00:22:20] <biys> both of you
[00:22:24] <causative_> all of mathematics was as true in 150 AD as it is true now
[00:22:36] <biys> but the metrics you'd use would be different based on your understandings of the world
[00:22:52] <causative_> no, ability to reason is learned and trained - you can study critical thinking, you can study mathematics and logic, you can study philosophy, you can practice by doing logic puzzles and arguing with people
[00:23:03] <causative_> some people are much better at reasoning than others and it's not all because of genetics
[00:23:12] <biys> so you'd say that 100 years ago, people had less ability to reason?
[00:23:46] <causative_> yes, that's well documented, fluid IQ scores (almost) 100 years ago were much lower and crystallized IQ scores were higher
[00:24:05] <biys> i'd say their ability to reason was still present.  their understanding of the world would have been less
[00:24:06] <causative_> 100 years ago, people remembered more and reasoned less
[00:24:12] <biys> that doesn't mean their ability to reason is any less
[00:24:14] <causative_> their brains were specialized differently
[00:24:28] <biys> interesting
[00:24:41] <causative_> see the Flynn effect
[00:25:05] <biys> so what would you say about people today vs. people 1,000 year sin the future?
[00:25:10] <biys> are we capable of reason today?
[00:25:15] <biys> less capable then in 1,000 years?
[00:25:22] <biys> :s/then/than/
[00:26:22] <biys> i think ones ability to reason isn't predicated on the fact that they know how the world works
[00:26:34] <biys> even a dog can reason
[00:27:33] <biys> dogs can remember events and use tools
[00:27:39] <biys> and find ways to solve issues
[00:28:58] <biys> i'm lost on this last part
[00:29:01] <biys> i need to re-read this
[00:29:36] <biys> you're saying that if now-you and yuo from long in the past got together you'd be able to come to the same realizations about the world
[00:29:40] <biys> i don't think so at all
[00:29:47] <I_Am_M00t> what the hekk is happening here
[00:29:49] <biys> i think your understandings of the world would be significantly different
[00:30:08] <biys> there can't be a more or less accurate way to live within the world
[00:30:42] <biys> because the determination of the most (or least) accurate way to live within the world would be based on the values held at the time

[05:22:46] <causative_> it's okay to be wrong as long as you learn something from it. We should be more accepting of other people being wrong, especially if they acknowledge it themselves, as long as they are seeking the truth, as we all should.
[05:26:01] <causative_> and we shouldn't be afraid of being wrong ourselves - trying on an idea for size, willing and able to discard it if it doesn't fit. Ideas are not lifetime commitments.
[05:28:36] <causative_> it's okay for other people to disagree.  It means one of you is wrong, and that's okay, because being wrong is okay, for either of you. As long as everyone is seeking the truth, which means often changing our mind about what's right, we're all on the same team.
[05:48:50] <causative_> to assert a claim is *not* to assert social dominance, and to accept a mistake is *not* to socially submit.  It is unfortunate that we have these instinctive associations.
[05:49:27] <causative_> asserting claims and accepting mistakes are simply steps on the path towards truth - no matter how far along you are on the path, you will do both, if you are truly seeking.

[07:26:55] <Delf> What if both of us are wrong!?
[07:29:04] <Delf> If I'm not mistaken, there's a word for what you described. To learn about something by sharing views and considering other povs, to determine "the truth"

[07:33:46] <Delf> It's actually nice to be wrong, at least when having a conversation. As you mentioned, we learn. It's an honorable state, to be in the seeking. But since people have serious issues with their sense of self-value, they seek vicious ways of attaining value, by comparing themselves with others or at least trying to put others down, making it seem as if they're so much greater.
[07:36:30] <Delf> Popular view is that it's a strength, to put others down. To win an argument. Dick measuring contesticles of intellect.

[07:48:54] <causative_> if people are wrong often - which they are - but nobody you know ever admits it, then you know a lot of intellectually dishonest people

[07:52:44] <Delf> My friends know that I'm wrong when I say that I lied about something.
[07:53:55] <audrey> living is hard and unforgiving - but it´s forgiving to be dead, it´s forgiving to be dead
[07:54:10] <audrey> Mmm. Americans will never understand the joys of hopeless doomer metal
[07:54:31] <audrey> But I digress. :) Going to bed in a bit.
[07:54:39] <causative_> admitting you're wrong is a good deed
[07:54:52] <causative_> pay it forward
[07:55:13] <Delf> But it's much more fun to say that I lied rather than say that I was wrong.
[07:55:43] <causative_> people are confused enough already without lying to each other
[07:56:07] <Delf> It's double the fun actually. Since it could be seen as an indication of me being deceitful and also... as a weakness that I'm unable to admit being wrong.
[07:56:49] <causative_> no, if you actually do that it's just status signaling
[07:57:08] <Delf> Status signaling?
[07:57:42] <I_Am_M00t> i've seen healthy exchanges on the internet, don't see what all the pessimism is about
[07:57:51] <causative_> how rogueish to be a liar, how dangerous, how deserving of cautious respect
[07:58:21] <Delf> You do not get to call yourself friend of mine if you lack trust in me
[07:58:21] <causative_> especially if the alternative is to admit you were actually wrong - how pitiful to be wrong, how unworthy
[07:58:34] <causative_> so you choose the high status option, "liar," instead of the low status one, "just wrong."
[07:58:56] <Delf> Flip it. Liar is now status. Just wrong is higher status
[07:58:59] <causative_> there's no logic here - it's just an instinct, always trying to beat your chest
[07:59:12] <Delf> Hold your horses... I'm being humble
[07:59:20] *** Joins: yanmaani (~yanmaani@gateway/tor-sasl/yanmaani)
[07:59:29] <Delf> s/now/low/
[07:59:30] <ro-bot-o> Delf meant to say: Flip it. Liar is low status. Just wrong is higher status
[07:59:36] <causative_> ironically, to say you're humble is bragging
[08:00:12] <Delf> Even if I'm actually humble?
[08:00:48] <causative_> there's the old joke about two men having a pissing contest about who is more humble
[08:01:01] <Delf> Hahahh.. not familiar with it :D
[08:01:34] <causative_> anyway, it's also best not to be cryptic - if you say you lied, you don't know that the other person will take it the way you think you meant it
[08:01:41] <causative_> they may interpret it differently
[08:01:45] <causative_> it's better to be straight with people
[08:01:49] <causative_> just own up
[08:01:57] <causative_> and it's a lot harder, emotionally speaking
[08:02:17] <Delf> I don't suffer those emotional defects
[08:02:33] <causative_> everyone suffers emotional defects
[08:02:40] <Delf> Why?
[08:02:55] <causative_> desire is the root of all suffering
[08:03:23] <Delf> No
[08:04:19] <causative_> you want things, which makes you upset when you don't get them, and it makes you lie and cheat and corrupt yourself
[08:04:26] <causative_> when I say "you" I mean anyone
[08:04:52] <causative_> that's an emotional defect - Buddhists would say the original defect
[08:05:03] <Delf> If you say me, I won't take it personally because it's rather your understanding of me... and not me. But if you say anyone then that's fucking personal.
[08:05:52] <Delf> Do you see reflections of yourselves in me, causative_?
[08:06:57] <causative_> we all share human nature
[08:07:19] <Delf> Yes, but we also have differences
[08:08:03] <causative_> the Buddhist problem of desire - or attachment - is common to all
[08:08:30] <Delf> Nothing you say or do can affect my "status" or rather self-value, so to speak. I will not get emotionall as consequence to "protect" and "defend" my value.
[08:09:15] <causative_> you're doing it right now
[08:09:28] <causative_> "I can't be bothered, I don't care about status" - is a very status-seeking thing to say
[08:09:32] <Delf> Being devoid of desire is not the answer
[08:09:41] <causative_> I didn't say it was
[08:10:21] <Delf> How is that a very status-seeking thing to say?
[08:10:45] <Delf> What I said is different than what you said.
[08:11:06] <Delf> I do care about my status, a lot. But I'm also aware that it is something only I can determine
[08:11:40] <Delf> My value is important to me. But others cannot give value to me
[08:12:09] <causative_> well, to say that is to tell others that you have a positive quality
[08:12:28] <causative_> one that also is rather unrealistic to actually have IMO - everyone is affected by social status, it's instinctual
[08:12:51] <causative_> so, if you tell others you have a positive quality, probably the status-seeking instinct is involved
[08:12:58] <Delf> Hmm...
[08:13:32] <causative_> you would be hurt if a lot of people started insulting you and telling you you're worthless
[08:13:40] <Delf> When social status is no longer relevant to you, you will understand
[08:13:46] <causative_> and if a crowd of people told you you're a hero and a great man, you'd feel puffed up
[08:13:54] <Delf> No...
[08:13:54] <causative_> you can't help feeling those things - humans have these instincts
[08:14:03] <causative_> we may *aspire* to be unbothered by what others think of us
[08:14:08] <Delf> Noooooooooooo....
[08:14:11] <causative_> we may live our lives consistent with that aspiration
[08:14:18] <causative_> but it's not something we can ever fully achieve
[08:14:26] <Delf> I do not aspire to be unbothered. I care. I cared a lot about what people thought of me. I was a people pleaser once
[08:15:50] <causative_> there are degrees
[08:15:53] <causative_> some care more, some care less
[08:16:00] <causative_> but everyone cares

[08:16:46] <Delf> It's not relevant mate. I'm self-convinced. Take for example, a person that does NOT see their own value. The WHOLE WORLD could be telling them that they have A LOT OF VALUE, but they won't be able to see it.
[08:17:26] <causative_> if the whole world tells them they have a lot of value, they're going to be at least partly convinced
[08:17:26] <Delf> If you are convinced you have no value... you will not value yourself... for all the things others value you for
[08:17:27] *** Joins: sweetsymphony (~bitterswe@2405:6e00:291:ea7f:71d4:a6f4:1f5e:2d53)
[08:17:30] <causative_> it will make them feel good
[08:17:39] <causative_> and they'll want more of that positive affirmation, even if they tell themselves they don't believe it
[08:17:56] <causative_> and they'll do things to try to get it - perhaps bad things, if they aren't scrupulous
[08:17:58] <Delf> There's those of course. But I'm referring to those other ones, that're convinced they have NOOO value whatsoever
[08:18:06] <Delf> Or rather, they're convinced that they're worthless
[08:18:29] <causative_> there isn't a single person who is acclaimed by millions who thinks they are totally worthless
[08:19:07] <Delf> Since we're not aware of any such situation taking place. I'm using this as an example to explain to you that they are convinced
[08:19:28] <causative_> perhaps some suicidal people may think they are totally worthless, but they aren't socially acclaimed either
[08:19:49] <causative_> depression has a lot to do with people not giving you the respect you think you need
[08:19:54] <Delf> Not many accepts me... VERY few like me
[08:20:04] <Delf> Even those that like me, struggle with understanding me

[08:22:12] <causative_> you'd have to have some very particular brain damage to actually not care what others think about you
[08:22:14] <Delf> Let me explain to you how I operate. I have emotions, but I don't care much about them. If they become excessive, I get to the bottom of the logic that is creating them and in doing so I evolve and as a consequence I do something about them or... they dissolve.
[08:22:41] <Delf> I never said that I don't care what others think about me
[08:22:58] <causative_> on the other hand, it's very common for people to adopt a style or air as if they just don't care
[08:23:11] <causative_> people with "carefully messy" clothes and hair
[08:23:17] <Delf> No mate... I care what others think, period. About me, about you about anything
[08:23:35] <Delf> But what they think does not determine how I feel about myself

[08:24:47] <Delf> I conform to the level of degree as to not attract unnecessary attention, when it comes to clothing
[08:25:01] <causative_> yeah I'm not saying you do the clothing thing
[08:25:32] <causative_> I'm saying a lot of people do, carefully arranging their social presentation to prove beyond a doubt that they don't care what other people think
[08:25:50] <causative_> which, to anyone with a little thought, proves the exact opposite
[08:26:04] <Delf> There are those of course. Do I strike you as someone who doesn't give a fuck what you think?
[08:26:54] <causative_> no
[08:27:14] <Delf> I don't know you, but I value you
[08:27:15] <causative_> but you have made certain claims
[08:27:33] <causative_> <Delf> Nothing you say or do can affect my "status" or rather self-value, so to speak.
[08:27:46] <Delf> That is totally different
[08:27:49] <causative_> <Delf> When social status is no longer relevant to you, you will understand
[08:27:55] <Delf> Exactly
[08:28:18] <causative_> social status is relevant to everyone
[08:28:19] <Delf> I'm not your everyday regular human, at least not when it comes to emotions
[08:28:27] <causative_> a lot of everyday regular humans think that
[08:28:32] <causative_> everybody's above average
[08:28:36] <Delf> Hahahh :D
[08:28:48] <causative_> and honestly you might be above "average" - hard to say what the average is for this
[08:28:49] <Delf> That's not uncommon indeed
[08:29:14] <Delf> I've no fucking idea... but I have yet to meet someone with similar relationship to emotions as myself
[08:29:20] <causative_> but even if you're above "average" with regard to disregarding social status, you still will do it, emotionally, because your genes programmed you to do that
[08:29:30] <causative_> as they programmed everyone
[08:29:59] <causative_> not equally, but to some degree in everyone
[08:30:16] <Delf> I'm not above average, I'm just a little different in that regard
[08:30:34] <Delf> Do I strike you as an alpha?
[08:30:48] <causative_> well, it's possible that certain brain disorders could cause someone to disregard social status
[08:31:04] <Delf> The way I am has nothing to do with brain disorder
[08:31:17] <Delf> It's a consequence of self-observation and understanding myselves
[08:31:21] <causative_> perhaps schizoid disorder or higher degrees of autism
[08:31:48] <causative_> not sure, I bet such people probably still do care about social status somewhat
[08:32:17] <Delf> People that do care about social status try to compliment me
[08:32:53] <Delf> That's what they value, they value me and so that's what they give... but they never get the result they expect
[08:33:02] <Delf> But that doesn't keep them from trying
[08:33:52] <Delf> You can't make me feel great about myself
[08:34:30] <Delf> I CANNOT take compliments personally, and if I tried that would involve lying to myself and there is no point to that
[08:34:59] <Delf> If you compliment me, I will learn what you value, nothing else. It has fuck all to do with me.
[08:36:42] <Delf> This is not just what I'm saying, this is what my brain balls has accepted, hence no emotions are produced in such situation.

[08:48:15] <Delf> That's great
[08:48:20] <Delf> I commend you for it
[08:48:39] <causative_> it's just a lot more common for people to claim to be unaffected by praise or criticism, than to actually be
[08:48:58] <causative_> "sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me" - it's just something people say
[08:49:04] <causative_> it's not true, words do hurt
[08:49:27] <Delf> Do you know when I get hurt?
[08:49:28] <Panther> I usually say nomenclature is attributive.
[08:49:29] <causative_> the rhyme is more about wishing they didn't
[08:49:59] <Delf> I'll tell you, when I feel hurt and emotionally violated. It's when I think that you know me.
[08:50:47] <Delf> When I think that you actually know me, and you say something bad about me or even say things that indicate that you don't know me.. I become emotionally devastated
[08:51:48] <Panther> People constantly make up the gaps that aren't filled in with the information at hand.. like impressionist paintings.
[08:52:16] <Delf> If you're my friend, and you say something about me that is fundamental and very incorrect, I may get sad because I get disappointed that you don't know me all that well
[08:52:18] <Panther> So, once you begin telling them things about yourself, you have begun that process in them.
[08:52:48] <Panther> That can be the result of miscommunication, too.
[08:52:51] <Delf> This does however, not affect my sense of value of myself
[08:54:10] <Panther> Some ppl are more outer directed, and some are more inner directed.
[08:54:26] <Delf> It's also common to make common mistakes and that is to assume everyone is what is most common.

[08:55:19] <Panther> Remember the old adage: Half of what you will learn is false; you just don’t know which half.
[08:56:05] <Panther> That is at the conclusion of a statement about reading books or journals...
[08:56:18] <Panther> Our advice is the same as Osler: Read the journals, and the old books.  Leave the new books to the old men. Young people need to learn the old ideas well, and see what’s new, and then they can tell what’s true from what’s false. Remember the old adage: Half of what you will learn is false; you just don’t know which half.
[08:56:32] <Panther> :)
[08:57:55] <Delf> Or spend time observing your internals... emotions, thoughts, feelings, desires, values, sense of self
[08:59:13] <Panther> I spent enough time observing them... I just have to keep an eye out... they are under 'statistical control.' :)
[09:00:21] <Panther> Statistical process control (SPC) is a method of quality control which employs statistical methods to monitor and control a process. This helps to ensure that the process operates efficiently, producing more specification-conforming products with less waste (rework or scrap). SPC can be applied to any process where the "conforming product" (product meeting specifications) output can be
[09:00:22] <Panther> measured. Key tools used in SPC include run charts, control charts, a focus on continuous improvement, and the design of experiments.
[09:03:33] <Delf> That makes me happy to hear :D

[09:12:11] <Delf> Why do you apply what is most common to doubt me? You're not forced to make a final decision that is of any significance. I suggest you take what I say for what it is and not worry about whether or not it's true or not. Give me the benefit of doubt and assume I'm being honest :)
[09:13:19] <Panther> It seems like it has been a lot longer.
[09:14:04] <Delf> Suppose I adopted the same approach. For example, most people I meet are assholes (a natural reaction to me being an assholes by nature, but I'm not aware of it) and I people like assholes because that's what people most commonly are, assholes

[10:35:58] <arryana> have you ever seen the old fashioned art aptitude test with circles and lines?
[10:36:03] <arryana> it's fascinating
[10:36:17] <Lumine> I'm not sure, could've been a part of one of my courses
[10:37:06] <Lumine> At least similar
[10:37:10] <arryana> it's a very basic test, but it's way harder than it seems
[10:37:30] <arryana> you start with a large sheet of blank paper, and then you draw as straight a line as you can from top to bottom across the middle
[10:37:36] <arryana> then you go from bottom to top on the same line
[10:37:45] <arryana> then right to left across the page, then left to right
[10:37:56] <arryana> circle clockwise, circle counterclockwise
[10:37:57] <arryana> etc.
[10:38:03] <Lumine> Oh right
[10:38:08] <Lumine> Haven't had that
[10:38:24] <Lumine> But I've had a bunch of straight line practise and circle practise etc.
[10:38:50] * arryana nods
[10:40:53] <Lumine> The most interesting exercise in one course I took was that they start you off with painting an eye, a complete eye that is, with shapes, form, colors etc. and you're not suppose to do too good on it, the point of it is to see your progress when you do it again at the end of the course.
[10:41:40] <Lumine> And I did the exercise and I was told it was anything but practise for me, it was a finished art piece. So that felt good
[10:42:27] <arryana> oh, that's brilliant
[10:42:33] <Lumine> Let me see if i can dig it up
[10:42:35] <arryana> well, you have an innate aptitude
[10:42:38] <arryana> i'd love to see that if you can

[11:40:14] <arryana> i think some things get easier as you get older, if you live right.  change is one of them.

[11:46:14] <Lumine> Sure, occasionally
[11:50:21] <Lumine> It's hard seeing the courses I was going to take at the place where I have my art related ones too
[11:51:44] <Lumine> But they're there anyway in case I change my mind some day
[11:54:14] <Lumine> Since I can't afford a fancy art school, even an online one, I'm forced to settle for the average course site. But they have some good courses amongst the hundreds of bad ones if you know where to look.

[12:08:48] <arryana> i'm curious, are you a bed-maker or a non-bed-maker?
[12:09:35] <Lumine> My apartment looks like Da Vinci's peak years
[12:09:38] <Lumine> I'll put it like that
[12:09:58] <Lumine> So non
[12:10:11] * arryana nods
[12:10:38] <arryana> i'm trying to decide if there's a correlation between bed makers and general life satisfaction
[12:10:51] <Lumine> I mean, if I had guests then I'd make my bed
[12:11:26] <Lumine> Oh yeah, i remember you talking about this some time ago
[12:11:55] <arryana> at first i thought it was just a general productivity thing
[12:12:19] <arryana> now i think it may be more of a whole-life-outlook thing
[12:12:26] <arryana> but i don't have enough data to say
[12:13:39] <Lumine> Well I'm severely mentally ill so that's a factor
[12:14:11] <arryana> hm
[12:14:22] <arryana> it would be nice if something as simple as that were helpful.
[12:14:33] <arryana> i tend to distrust simple answers, though
[12:16:33] <Lumine> My friend is on the opposite spectrum. He says that anything you can't explain simply, like it was told to a 5 year old, it's not sufficient in answering something.
[12:17:26] <arryana> huh
[12:17:33] <arryana> clarity, hell yes
[12:18:06] <arryana> but if you said to a five year old, 'make your bed every day and you will be happy', that's just patently untrie
[12:18:08] <arryana> untrue
[12:18:39] <arryana> however, i'm fairly convinced that there's -something- to it, even if it's just the mental boost from being in an orderly environment
[12:22:15] <arryana> huh.  google turns up quite a few studies which say bed makers are more productive and report higher life satisfaction
[12:22:18] <arryana> though that's rather subjective
[12:22:46] <arryana> i'd love to know the mechanism, if it's a chicken-and-egg thing.
[12:23:15] <Lumine> Well he's not advocating saying falsehoods. He's merely after reducing complex ideas down into a language that is more understandable. You don't have to lie to simplify necessarily.
[12:23:19] <arryana> 'i'm happier/more productive because i make my bed' or 'i'm in a mental place where i can't keep my shit together enough to make my bed or anything else'
[12:23:25] <arryana> yeah
[12:23:28] <arryana> well.
[12:23:51] <arryana> my issue with it is that it becomes a hazard of reducing a truth to a cliche if it's oversimplified.
[12:24:32] <arryana> those distinctions require a smarter person than i am
[12:25:52] <Lumine> Well maybe he enjoys cliches, I don't know. I'm more of a adaptation advocate than settling for either extreme. Overly complex or overly simple are both not ideal.
[12:25:59] <arryana> i wonder if there is a straight up health aspect to it too.
[12:26:08] * arryana nods
[12:26:26] <Lumine> There could be
[12:27:08] <arryana> i mean, i'm old, so i was taught that the 'proper' way to make a bed is to turn it down when you wake up, so the bed and covers can air for an hour or so before making it properly.
[12:27:37] <arryana> ie, get up, turn down the bed, go have breakfast/tea/whatever, morning chores, then make the bed
[12:29:29] <arryana> that raises another question.  are you an open-window-sleeper?

[22:15:43] <biys> people can posit anything they want at any time about anything
[22:15:57] <biys> however, the amount of discoveries that can take place in the universe are likely limited
[22:16:31] <biys> we could reach a time where we know everything there is to know about everything
[22:16:34] <causative_> a theorem is different from a theory - a theorem is something that can be rigorously, formally proved in mathematics

[22:18:01] <causative_> that there are an infinite number of statements in mathematics that can be rigorously, formally proved

[22:20:13] <biys> i don't follow
[22:20:34] <causative_> you know what it means for white to be able to force a win from a position in chess?
[22:20:54] <biys> sure?  but i don't understand what you're trying to say here
[22:20:58] <audrey> I don´t see what this has to do with anything
[22:21:14] <causative_> <biys> my position is that there is likely an end to the amount of things we can understand about the univers
[22:21:19] <biys> yes
[22:21:38] <biys> i typed that
[22:22:08] <causative_> so is the statement about the chess board a statement "about the universe," considering that the chess board is a physical object in the universe?
[22:22:19] <biys> i refuse
[22:22:23] <audrey> There are not an infinite number of possible chess positions.
[22:22:25] <biys> because i don't see your point
[22:22:38] <causative_> I can't lead you to the point unless you first answer the question
[22:22:41] <biys> there is a finite amount of potential moves that can be made in chess playing
[22:22:42] <audrey> Again, what´s the game plan here with this line of thought?
[22:22:49] <causative_> where I go with this depends on your answer to the question
[22:22:52] <biys> there is not an infinite amount of moves that can be made in chess
[22:22:58] <causative_> I didn't say there were
[22:23:06] <audrey> Just say what you mean, for god´s sake.
[22:23:55] <biys> audrey: that poem, i liked btw.
[22:24:01] <causative_> I'm asking you about what you consider, or don't consider, to be "things to understand about the universe"
[22:24:12] <biys> what do you mean?
[22:24:17] <biys> what do i consider?
[22:24:18] <audrey> biys: Thanks! :)
[22:24:41] <causative_> I'm asking YOU what you mean
[22:24:58] <biys> asking me what i mean about what?  hah
[22:25:04] <biys> beg your pardon
[22:25:06] <biys> i am an idiot
[22:25:35] <biys> i tend to think you make some declarations about a lot of things
[22:25:47] <biys> i like what you say for the most part
[22:25:51] <audrey> Maybe don´t get caught up on what you think someone else means, and just say whatever your opinion is.
[22:25:56] <audrey> This gets really god damn irritating.
[22:26:13] <causative_> it's elenchus audrey, be nice
[22:26:43] <audrey> biys: any insights on Russian history or literature then
[22:26:44] <biys> i'm not sure what part of the line of text that deosn't make sense to you
[22:26:46] <causative_> the goal of elenchus is to reach a mutual understanding
[22:26:49] <audrey> to put the Monty Python foot down
[22:26:59] <biys> if you can elavorate further i might be able to expand on it
[22:27:06] <causative_> in order to reach this understanding it is necessary to ask the other person what they mean or how they would answer certain questions
[22:27:08] <biys> but at this point i'm not even sure what point you're trying to make
[22:27:20] <causative_> biys, it is possible you could mean several different things when you say "things to understand about the universe"
[22:27:33] <biys> is it possible?
[22:27:36] <I_Am_M00t> haha, elenchus makes me chuckle every time
[22:27:42] <causative_> you might be referring to the physical laws of the universe - and there I would agree it is possible there is a finite set of physical laws
[22:28:01] <causative_> you might be referring to the subjective experiences a person could have - and there I would agree it is possible that a person has only a finite set of subjective experiences
[22:28:16] <causative_> or you might be referring to any fact whatsoever we might pose, regarding a physical object
[22:28:24] <causative_> I'm asking you whether you include the third one in your notion
[22:28:36] <causative_> specifically in regard to the chessboard - the fact of whether white can win from the given position
[22:30:33] <causative_> I don't get why you are so reluctant to answer a question seeking to clarify what you mean! it's like you're treating me as an enemy combatant to whom you must not divulge any more information than necessary
[22:30:54] <causative_> the goal of a philosophical discussion is to share *as much as possible* about our views, to better understand them
[22:31:01] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[22:31:01] <causative_> withholding of information about them serves no purpose
[22:31:03] <audrey> I advise dropping the subject since it sounds like biys is not particularly excited about this
[22:31:13] <audrey> Take a hint, man
[22:31:16] <I_Am_M00t> you're trying to get honest answers out of biys ?
[22:31:36] <biys> i will be one of the first to admit that i might not know what i'm talking about
[22:31:49] <biys> but i still don't really follow what you're suggesting causative_
[22:31:58] <biys> can you give me an example of understandings that could be infinite maybe?

[22:39:11] <biys> can you explain to me how we won't know everything about mathematics?

[22:42:01] <biys> causative_ do you have something i can read on this?
[22:42:33] <biys> is this Cantor?
[22:43:02] <causative_> no, it's more basic than Cantor
[22:43:15] <causative_> it's about the notion of proof, and formal proof, in mathematics
[22:43:31] <causative_> http://logic.stanford.edu/intrologic/notes/chapter_04.html#section_04_03 is an example of a formal logical system in which we derive proofs; you can also start earlier in that book if you wish
[22:43:31] <ro-bot-o> [url] Chapter 4 - Propositional Proofs | logic.stanford.edu
[22:43:57] <causative_> a proof is a sequence of propositions, where each additional proposition is derived from earlier ones in the sequence according to certain formal rules
[22:44:18] <causative_> a proposition in this context is a mathematical statement consisting of a finite sequence of symbols
[22:44:30] <causative_> like x^2 + y^2 = z^2 is a proposition
[22:44:32] <audrey> OK, so to try to engage with this seriously, there are an infinite number of mathematical/logical propositions which you can concoct
[22:45:25] <audrey> I don´t see where that gets, us though.
[22:45:42] <audrey> That´s a bit like saying there is no largest integer, we can just keep going on forever
[22:45:48] <biys> is this specifically related to math?
[22:45:58] <audrey> It´s *true* but also completely meaningless, practically speaking.
[22:46:38] <causative_> audrey, I really can't engage with you, I'm sorry
[22:47:01] <biys> i'm sorry for bringing this up
[22:47:09] <causative_> you say interesting things sometimes but I can't take the risk
[22:47:11] <biys> obviously outside my wheel house

[22:47:56] <causative_> which she's done before
[22:47:57] <biys> here's the poem anyways audrey
[22:47:58] <biys> https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50497/after-death
[22:47:59] <ro-bot-o> [url] After Death by Christina Rossetti | Poetry Foundation | www.poetryfoundation.org
[22:48:16] <biys> idk why your poem reminded me of this one
[22:48:17] <biys> but it did
[22:48:31] <dispersed> Bless the sinners who spread covid
[22:48:59] <audrey> biys: Nice one.
[22:49:15] <audrey> Both poems allude to some sort of after-death experience
[22:49:22] <audrey> this one much more directly than the Ryzhy one
[22:50:28] <audrey> I am looking for more Ryzhy poems that I could translate
[22:50:44] <audrey> but it is very difficult; he is quite orthodox with rhyme and meter in a way that is difficult to preserve in English
[22:50:53] <causative_> it's very rare that you find someone who is able and willing to engage in elenchus without feeling ego threatened
[22:51:05] <biys> my ego isn't threatened btw
[22:51:19] <causative_> didn't say it was
[22:51:26] <biys> i just don't really follow.  it's likely as a result of what i don't know though
[22:51:32] <biys> maybe i should be offended though hahah
[22:52:04] *** Quits: ravan (~ravan@user/ravan) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:52:22] <causative_> well, when a mathematician or logician writes a formal proof, they begin with certain axioms, which are propositions they are allowed to write down in their proof anywhere
[22:52:43] <causative_> and certain inference rules, which are ways of combining propositions they already wrote down, to form a new proposition they can write down
[22:53:07] <causative_> the challenge of mathematics is to follow the rules of the formal proof, to write down a theorem on the bottom line
[22:53:21] <biys> it's forgiving to be dead
[22:53:24] <causative_> when that is done they have proved the theorem
[22:53:35] <causative_> some these theorems can be very interesting and difficult to prove
[22:54:09] <causative_> and there's an infinite number of possible theorems that could be proved, if you had enough paper
[22:54:29] <biys> audrey: what do you think they mean drowned without a fight?  and what do you make of the faucet?
[22:54:33] <biys> and the drips of the faucet
[22:54:45] <causative_> an infinite number of ways to write down a sequence of propositions on the paper, following the rules of your logic system
[22:55:10] <biys> yes, but does this actually mean that the understandings we can obtain from the universe are limitless?
[22:55:16] <audrey> biys: well, truth be told I had to interpolate from the original poem a bit to preserve the meter/rhyme. The original does not directly mention a drowning but alludes strongly to a suicide in a bathtub.
[22:55:30] <audrey> So I took a little creative liberty to make that explicit.
[22:55:41] <causative_> well, mathematical theorems are also claims about a physical object
[22:56:03] <audrey> I don´t know for sure, but Ryzhy seems to be describing the inside of a Soviet mental institution
[22:56:07] <causative_> "it is possible to write down a proof following the rules of logic system S, with the bottom line being P."
[22:56:13] <causative_> writing is a physical action
[22:56:19] <audrey> and «enameled vessel» is one way of describing the old fashioned standalone bathtubs
[22:56:21] <causative_> the proof, on paper, is a physical object
[22:56:44] <causative_> whether or not it is possible to write such a proof, is therefore a claim about the physical universe
[22:57:13] <causative_> and there's an infinite number of such claims we might discover
[22:57:32] <audrey> biys: Who drowns without a fight? A suicide.
[22:58:02] <audrey> Normally you would expect signs of violence - thrashing, panic. But not here.
[22:58:18] <audrey> And I don´t know about the faucet, what its significance is, other than perhaps adding atmosphere

[22:59:29] <causative_> here's another infinite set of things we might discover:  we might ask whether it is possible to draw on paper a certain molecule (or "graph"), without any lines crossing between the atoms ("nodes")
[22:59:52] <causative_> there are an infinite number of such graphs that we might attempt to draw, and only some of them can be drawn without lines crossing
[23:00:10] <I_Am_M00t> i don't get the relevance of this topic, it seems like 90% of the problem is spotting flaws in the argument, rather than questioning the mathematical evidence
[23:00:22] <causative_> mathematical evidence for what?
[23:00:31] <I_Am_M00t> but this is the same problem as with all elenchus discussions
[23:00:35] <biys> i comprehend what he's saying
[23:00:57] <biys> i just don't really think it means that the potential of what we can know is limitless
[23:01:05] <causative_> why not?
[23:01:26] <biys> s/he/they/
[23:01:26] <ro-bot-o> biys meant to say: i just don't really think it means that tthey potential of what we can know is limitless
[23:01:38] <biys> wrong line!
[23:02:59] <biys> because i dont necessarily think that the axioms we'd use to undertsand the world can be defined in the way you're suggesting.  i don't think there is potentially limitless axioms that can be worked to understand how things works
[23:03:06] <I_Am_M00t> the idea that mathematical theorems are physical objects because they take up ink on a piece of paper just sounds like trolling
[23:03:42] <causative_> that's just appeal to the stone, I_Am_M00t - saying a thing is ridiculous without having any evidence against it
[23:03:50] <biys> it is likely that everything works in a very particular way
[23:03:56] <I_Am_M00t> causative_: i disagree
[23:04:12] <causative_> (although to be precise I would say that the theorem itself is an abstract object that does not exist at all; what is a physical object is a particular instantiation of that theorem on paper)
[23:04:26] <I_Am_M00t> i think you're making ridiculous assertions, and want people to engage to discover the flaws
[23:04:34] <biys> but i can see that if we make a predetermiend judgement of this or that we can make the potentials that are a result of that limitless
[23:04:47] <I_Am_M00t> you claim to be holding honest debate,  I don't believe that one bit.
[23:04:57] <biys> i get what you're saying though
[23:05:07] <causative_> I_Am_M00t, if you think a proposition is ridiculous, you need a concrete reason
[23:05:32] <causative_> otherwise the only rational thing to do is to either agree, or be uncertain about it
[23:05:40] <I_Am_M00t> you're writing random ideas out, bit there's no depth to the reasoning
[23:06:00] <I_Am_M00t> i don't need to show you anything to think your idea is ridiculous
[23:06:05] <biys> what he's saying makes sense
[23:06:07] <biys> i'd say
[23:06:09] <causative_> well, that's the fallacy of appeal to the stone
[23:06:20] <I_Am_M00t> nope, that's you asserting things

[23:06:52] <I_Am_M00t> and then referencing fallacies because others don't want to spend hours uncovering flaws in your arguments
[23:07:06] <audrey> biys: Perhaps I should remove the reference to drowning and replace with - «they found him gone without a fight» or something similar
[23:07:10] <audrey> I struggled with this line in particular
[23:07:13] <I_Am_M00t> you're sincere, I'm sincere, we're getting nowhere
[23:07:51] <causative_> it's actually somewhat confounding that you think it's ridiculous to say that ink on paper, forming a proof, is a physical object
[23:08:00] <causative_> of course it is a physical object! what else could it be?
[23:08:02] <audrey> Better yet:
[23:08:02] <audrey> They found he'd gone without a fight
[23:08:35] <biys> audrey: what is the life that emerges?  a battered harlot?
[23:08:42] <causative_> and it matters a lot that mathematical theorems have physical instantiations; all of computing depend on it
[23:08:45] <audrey> yes, that is a more or less direct translation
[23:08:58] <causative_> encryption depends on proving theorems about large primes
[23:09:10] <audrey> жизнь, растрепана как блядь (life, battered like a cunt/whore)
[23:09:10] <causative_> and encryption certainly is a physical process, with physical consequences
[23:09:10] <I_Am_M00t> causative_: you misunderstand, I'm not saying that..I'm saying you haven't motivated why that is relevant to the discussion
[23:09:19] <I_Am_M00t> you just threw out the idea out
[23:09:23] <audrey> «harlot» is really too polite compared to the original
[23:09:29] <audrey> but it fits the spirit better in English

[23:10:41] <biys> benjamin
[23:10:44] <I_Am_M00t> step 1 is where things went wrong, not further down the line
[23:10:58] <causative_> it's relevant because, if a proof can be instantiated as a physical object, then *which* mathematical claims have proofs is a physical question
[23:11:09] <causative_> which means that everything about math translates into questions about the world
[23:11:20] <biys> he travels back and forth across russia
[23:11:29] <biys> i love his channel
[23:11:30] <causative_> of course we know that a lot about math translates into questions about the world - e.g. engineers use math to build bridges
[23:11:41] <biys> cloest i will likely get to russia
[23:11:43] <causative_> but it's very clear and comprehensive to draw this correspondence between the abstract proof and the physical instantiation of the proof
[23:12:14] <I_Am_M00t> causative_: that's nonsense
[23:12:24] <causative_> oh, what part?
[23:12:28] <I_Am_M00t> i can't believe you genuinely think that
[23:12:38] <causative_> well, I do
[23:12:48] <causative_> I don't see you raising any specific objections to it either
[23:12:56] <I_Am_M00t> ofc you dont
[23:13:29] <I_Am_M00t> "everything about math translates into the real world because you can print math on paper"
[23:13:54] <biys> more than math tho
[23:14:17] <causative_> well, that's a fair representation of my point, if a little reductive I_Am_M00t

[23:14:35] <causative_> that's also true
[23:14:45] <causative_> also every thought translates into the real world because it is instantiated in physical neurons
[23:14:54] <I_Am_M00t> this type of statement sure sounds good, but it's complete nonsense,
[23:15:01] <I_Am_M00t> it's a semantic game
[23:15:04] <causative_> it's not nonsense to say that the brain corresponds with the mind
[23:15:10] <I_Am_M00t> it's nonsense, sorry
[23:15:29] <causative_> I forget, do you believe in a separate soul or do you believe consciousness is physically based, or what?
[23:15:37] <I_Am_M00t> lord of the rings translates into the real world because it exists on paper
[23:16:01] <brigand> heh
[23:16:03] <I_Am_M00t> are orcs real because the exist on paper?
[23:16:26] <I_Am_M00t> that's misleading language
[23:16:27] <causative_> sure - this is not, by the way, to say that the things referred to in lotr are real; just that we can find physical things that correspond to the lotr idea
[23:16:41] <causative_> no, the orcs aren't real, but the idea of an orc is real
[23:17:22] <I_Am_M00t> whatever causative_ , everything with your "elenchus" discussions is about semantic games, and it's for other parties to find these very transparent logical flaws. There is no real discussion
