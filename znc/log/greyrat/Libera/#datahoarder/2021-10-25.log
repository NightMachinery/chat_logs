[01:38:20] <evilgohan2> I had a girl get mad at me because I refused to let her go down without me wearing one.
[01:39:39] <evilgohan2> and that's reason #NaN why I'm still single.
[01:43:39] <evilgohan2> Error: Buffer overflow
[01:46:46] <ThePendulum> guess I wouldn't mind that as long as we were both recently tested
[01:51:57] <ThePendulum> suppose one risk that would remain is her having oral herpes, but we're not going to be kissing with condoms in our mouth so I'm not sure how much there is to salvage there
[01:53:05] <Selavi> I just slather ivermectin all over my lips. science.

[02:03:47] <evilgohan2> ThePendulum: it's interesting you mention that. Up until recently, a lot of places here wouldn't even bother to test for HSV1/2 because it's generally assumed that at least half the population has it.
[02:04:45] <evilgohan2> Selavi: can probably get some healing crystals, essential oils, and scrape off the side of a salt lamp. Mix it up real good and serve.

[02:04:55] <unfinity> evilgohan2 you befriended a duck in 3.108 seconds! You have made friends with 193 ducks in #datahoarder.
[02:05:52] <ThePendulum> evilgohan2: yeah I was just reading that, also because it's a more elaborate test I think, guess you'd have to request it specifically if you're worried about that
[02:06:47] <evilgohan2> my last go around, I did a test for pretty much everything. HSV1/2, HIV, HEP C, GON, CHLAM. If you ask, they'll test for it.
[02:06:55] <evilgohan2> The only one they won't test males for is HPV
[02:07:00] <evilgohan2> apparently, there's no test for it.
[02:07:54] <ThePendulum> guess there is a very slim chance I could have some of those, herpes is the main one because it's more likely to transfer from other parts of my body
[02:08:23] <evilgohan2> HSV1/2 can be tested for with a blood test.
[02:09:21] <evilgohan2> GON / CHLAM can be tested for with a simple urine test. Usually you can get results on that one same day. It's the blood tests that typically have a turnaround period
[02:09:53] <evilgohan2> here, HIV test used to turn around in 1-3 days. But with COVID-19 tests bogging down labs, they're up to a week now.

[17:50:57] <evilgohan2> So, the long-standing behavior of reddit has been that they automatically locked threads after 6 months.
[17:51:04] <ThePendulum> I mean to me this is a godsent
[17:51:05] <evilgohan2> This prevented voting and commenting on said threads.
[17:51:24] <ThePendulum> because IIRC even I as a mod couldn't comment on it
[17:51:29] <evilgohan2> correct.
[17:52:00] <ThePendulum> I do guess just leaving that toggle enabled would've been a fair enough middle ground
[17:52:11] <ThePendulum> and show mods a link to that setting in the "this thread is archived" message
[17:52:11] <evilgohan2> Reddit has changed the behavior to now default to older threads and comments are now able to be voted on and commented in __unless__ the subreddit chooses to opt-out of that and retain the older behavior.
[17:52:30] <evilgohan2> My strong preference would have been that they made this new behavior opt-in rather than enabling it by default.
[17:52:52] <ThePendulum> I think my confusion comes from the fact that the setting is called "Archive old threads" so it's disabled by default :P
[17:52:57] <evilgohan2> Especially as, given the context of the subreddit that I help mod, such threads are prone to targetting by bad actors.
[17:53:15] <ThePendulum> or "Archive posts" to be exact
[17:53:24] <evilgohan2> Yeah, up until 2 weeks ago, that setting did not even exist.
[17:53:47] <ThePendulum> anyway it's easy enough to switch over, maybe I should start reading mod mail though lol
[17:54:14] <ThePendulum> but either it's not a problem or I'll be alerted of it as soon as the first person writes a comment on a previously archived thread
[17:54:18] <evilgohan2> /r/modnews and /r/modsupport are good to keep an eye on things.
[17:54:51] <ThePendulum> but in my case we have very specific posts and rules on our subreddit that often require information to be ammended to old posts
[17:55:44] <evilgohan2> Like I said, I don't mind the change.
[17:55:51] <ThePendulum> or more often a subreddit has a top post that lots of people are still seeing but can't comment on, also not to give more information about the subject
[17:55:52] <evilgohan2> I do mind being automatically opted-in to the change.
[17:55:58] <ThePendulum> yeah that seems a bit silly
[17:56:17] <ThePendulum> I guess they aimed to get more engagement
[17:58:11] <evilgohan2> As is always the case.
[17:59:40] <ThePendulum> I really wish they allowed mods to change the title of a post with some kind of clear indicator that it has happened
[17:59:54] <evilgohan2> That will likely never happen
[18:00:17] <evilgohan2> Especially after their CEO got busted changing comments / threads on that one subreddit
[18:00:21] <ThePendulum> would be really useful for subs with restricted title formats so instead of deleting posts we can just fix the title
[18:00:27] <ThePendulum> lol
[18:03:11] <evilgohan2> Yeah, we have that. Particularly as some users like to demonstrate their slants in thread titles so we put a rule in place that any thread linking to a news article must use the title of the article, the lede, or be as unbiased of a summary as humanly possible. Editorialize the thread title and the thread is getting removed.
[18:05:13] <ThePendulum> thinking both the mod and the poster have to confirm on the change or something, so we could give them 24 hours to approve before deleting the post
[18:05:31] <ThePendulum> (so we can't just put "OP is a cock")
[18:08:29] <skye0_mobile> apparently reddit is owned by condé nast these days so it's a big media company trying to do anything to maintain and/or rake in ad rev or traffic
[18:08:56] <skye0_mobile> for those libertarians who loved reddit for being "unique" and "subversive", those days are over just because the internet got bigger
[18:09:03] <evilgohan2> Conde Naste has owned reddit for years.
[18:09:12] <skye0_mobile> how long?
[18:09:15] <evilgohan2> at least 10
[18:09:18] <skye0_mobile> ah
[18:09:43] <evilgohan2> > Condé Nast Publications acquired the site in October 2006. In 2011, Reddit became an independent subsidiary of Condé Nast's parent company, Advance Publications.
[18:09:56] <skye0_mobile> only reason why i'm on reddit is because it's because it's better for me to be on a social network than keep quitting and making accounts just to rant and it's easier for me to block people and topics as long as i stick to one device or so

[19:29:15] <ThePendulum> that gets in the way of defining it as 'good' to me
[19:30:30] <ThePendulum> a HC550 seems like a good catch
[19:36:41] <viktorvond> was worried about the 3.3v topics and possibly having to tape the 1st few pins if the hp didn't recognize it... the sata power cables within the pc only had 4 wires (i think the orange-5th wire, was the 3.3v one); did purchase some kapton tape from another thread recommendation in case
[19:37:29] <viktorvond> definitely added some weight to my light sff after putting it in... can't imagine the folks with many of these drives in a rack :P

[20:10:32] <viktorvond> do you recall ThePendulum on the taping of that WD ultrastar, the sata power wiring to plug into the drive, had 4 or 5 wires? there's a nice precut 1/8" 1Mil kaptop from tapes master that covers those pins perfectly
[20:11:03] <viktorvond> kapton*/polyimide
[20:23:27] <ThePendulum> hmm there would be missing pins on the connector, or how would you know what is wired up internally?
[20:24:08] <ThePendulum> also used kapton, painstakingly cut small strokes out of my 3d printer roll though, heh https://i.imgur.com/cjNCxjj.jpg

[20:50:52] <skye0_mobile> basically i've set it so if a specific line (the ones i'm interested in are headings for bookmark folders) in the HTML file matches a text entry the code stops executing but i don't like that when the bookmark categories could be reordered or new categories introduced

[21:42:29] <skye0_mobile> On Windows it's at %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[profile].default-release\places.sqlite
[21:57:28] <rmmh> yup
[21:59:01] <evilgohan2> I didn't have any particular interest, and then I spent years working in PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL (:shudder:), and MySQL
[21:59:17] <evilgohan2> now, I have a MariaDB server at home lol.
[21:59:26] <evilgohan2> though I could make better use of it.
[21:59:42] <rmmh> I use sqlite for everything I can
[21:59:51] <evilgohan2> I'm trying to move away from SQLite.
[22:00:02] <evilgohan2> I'll probably keep building stuff to support it, and just let PDO handle the abstraction
[22:00:17] <evilgohan2> and it works fine for certain use cases
[22:00:21] <evilgohan2> But in others, it's not great.
[22:00:42] <evilgohan2> That's not necessarily a bad thing though. I always espouse "use the right tool for the job."
