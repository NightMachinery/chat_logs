[00:01:52] <bugweiser> bone-baboon: well, since the australia issue is the most used example (for being extreme in this case and covering an entire continent) to pave the way (in tutorials) to exlain that warranty disclaimers are not recognised (as intended) in every jurisdiction (and hence they are followed with a liability disclaimer for whatever falls through the cracks of the warranty disclaimer) that it can even be flat-out illigal to have one (not properly disclaim

This is a criminal or civil offence and can be punished by fines of up to $1.1 million for a body corporate and $220,000 for a person other than a body cor

[00:04:32] <bugweiser> end quote.  'this statement' refers to the 'un-disclaimed' canned warranty disclaimer
[00:07:08] <bugweiser> anywho.. this is nothing new, all 'bigger'/'more "serious"' licences not only disclaim the warranty disclaimer part, but even adds in an extra section to extra re-affirm the the licence does not waive warranty in australia etc.  (they usually also add an additional clause for canada (often a part of the legal part of the contract in french) and germany (where the warranty disclaimer is also a no go).

[00:34:41] <bugweiser> additionally, at that point it would in no way shape or form be a vanity licence, but something that actually has use in filling a gap: people wanting a 0-3 clause mit style licence with that one phrase "to the extent permitted by law" added.

[00:40:47] <bugweiser> I really haven't found one, hence my initial opening question (stemming from drafting our own). Which is: that all-caps warranty disclaimer I posted and discussed above, can we use that? Can that particular text be copyrighted protected by whomever wrote it first?

[05:00:23] <bugweiser> what is the licence of the ISC licence? and the MIT licences? and the BSD licences?  Asking couse on the #osi channel i'm told that every user of such licences creates a derivative work by utilising them and that (each and evereyone) then is a new licence.. Can someone clarify or point me to something that clarifies this?

[05:12:45] <bugweiser> I asked on that channel:
[05:12:48] <bugweiser> Say one picked licence <whatever> let's say MIT and changed 'the author' or 'copyright holder' (etc..) to another of the previous list.. or company/author name. Is that a new licence/contract?
[05:12:58] <bugweiser> or is it still MIT (in that example) with <replace_with_your_name> filled out?
[05:13:20] <bugweiser> answer: 
[05:13:22] <bugweiser> The latter.
[05:13:31] <bugweiser> The actual license text doesn't start until after the copyright statement.
[05:13:37] <bugweiser> my followup:
[05:13:51] <bugweiser> ok, that's addressing the copyright line it starts with I assume. what abou replacing a similar 'field' in the warranty discalimer  (if for *example* the disclaimer said "the author" and the user changes that to "the copyright holder and contributors") ?
[05:14:16] <bugweiser> answer: 
[05:14:18] <bugweiser> That's a derivative work.
[05:15:21] <bugweiser> .
[05:15:36] <bugweiser> some lines before that it was said that: All works of sufficient originality fall under copyright, including warranty disclaimers.
[05:16:24] <bugweiser> now for some examples where you'd 'fill out these fields':
[05:16:24] <lispmacs[work]> bugweiser: I might be misunderstanding your question, but the MIT license specifically says you must preserve the copyright notice and the license text in order to use the software
[05:16:55] <bugweiser> https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-1-Clause.html
[05:17:03] <bugweiser> https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT-Modern-Variant.html
[05:17:15] <bugweiser> https://www.isc.org/licenses/   https://spdx.org/licenses/ISC.html
[05:17:51] <lispmacs[work]> if you modify the code, you are creating a derivative work, regardless of whether or not you properly obey the license
[05:18:10] <bugweiser> I'm talking about the licence itself
[05:18:23] *** Joins: Megver83 (~Icedove@pc-88-170-100-190.cm.vtr.net)
[05:18:54] <lispmacs[work]> bugweiser: you want to create a new license, and apply it to code not already license? Or change the license on code with a license already?
[05:19:12] <bugweiser> ICS says: 'IN NO EVENT SHALL ISC BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL'
[05:19:35] <bugweiser> well, obviously, ISC sould be liable for my software...
[05:20:30] <bugweiser> so a user of ISC woul replace ISC with <your name> or <your corp> or "the author" or "the copyright holder(s) (and contributors)"
[05:21:51] <bugweiser> but the warranty disclaimer text was copyrighted (if unlicenced) and changing these things (as asked specifically) would therefore create a deriviative work (ie: your licence text is now a derivative work of a text with unknown copyright/licence).

[05:23:40] <lispmacs[work]> bugweiser: that is an interesting thing to think about. The GPL licenses are specifically copyrighted in the license text by the Free Software Foundation
[05:25:22] <bugweiser> indeed (gpl) altough apparently a page on the fsf says you can use parts of their text under some provisions like not referencing gpl (or something like that) etc.

[05:27:10] <bugweiser> states: 
[05:27:18] <bugweiser> You can legally use the GPL terms (possibly modified) in another license provided that you call your license by another name and do not include the GPL preamble, and provided you modify the instructions-for-use at the end enough to make it clearly different in wording and not mention GNU (though the actual procedure you describe may be similar).
[05:27:55] <bugweiser> so yeah.. that's kinda contrary (it seems) compared to what the licence text itself says.

[05:36:57] <lispmacs[work]> bugweiser: I guess your question about the non-copyleft licenses is kind of an interesting legal mental-game, but it is hard to see the practical relevance. There are multiple "BSD-style" licenses with slight modifications, but I've never heard anybody trying to claim that somebody was violating their copyright
[05:38:47] <bugweiser> and I'm trying to figure out how that works... (in the interest of trying to figure out if one can or can not copy a warranty disclaimer text from an existing licence).

[05:39:56] <bugweiser> after all, If I ask: can I copy the warranty disclaimer text of licence yadayada, then the answer given to now is no, the licence text including warranty disclaimer is copyrighted.
[05:40:52] <lispmacs[work]> I would think that if you could claim copyright control over a small warranty disclaimer, our already crazy copyright system would descend into utter chaos and self-destruct
[05:42:23] <lispmacs[work]> by the way, I've copyrighted the phrase "warranty disclaimer text", so please stop using that
