[11:28:35] <dave0> hayley: you're famous!
[11:28:59] <dave0> i remember you were on hackernews before too
[11:31:20] <hayley> dave0: Not in a good way this time.
[11:37:34] <hayley> As for my non-public statement: I don't consider my writing style to be induced by Lisp weenieing, because a. everyone thinks I write like Bookchin, who notably started writing 6 years before the discovery of Lisp with "The Problem of Chemicals in Food" and b. the implication arrow is the wrong way around: Lisp hackers aren't whiny bitches, whiny bitches become Lisp hackers because (usually) there isn't a lot to whine about there.
[11:37:53] <hayley> At least on IRC I was much less polite before learning Lisp.
[11:39:24] <White_Flame> I think that's a very good observation
[11:39:30] <White_Flame> I would certainly put myself in that category
[11:39:57] <White_Flame> people leave common languages because they're ticked off at the terribleness of the status quo
[11:40:22] <hayley> Though, I don't think "likes Lisp, dislikes C" is as small a group as that person suggested.
[11:41:47] <hayley> (How does one write like Bookchin, you ask? Simple enough: pick fancy, sometimes archaic, words, and then throw in a few swears to keep the reader on edge.)
[11:58:35] <ck_> is that why you're doing things in the comfortable simplicity of the eight bit c64? :)
[12:00:06] <dave0> hayley: c gets dumber every time a new standard comes out
[12:00:56] <dave0> it gets dumber along the way too i guess
[12:01:45] <hayley> dave0: For the amateur programmer and amateur VM writer, being told that your C program will crash rather than do something bogus, and having it almost never do that (think that an off-by-one error probably won't page fault...) would be hell.
[12:04:10] <dave0> there must be something i don't see in c, because everyone uses it to write their operating system in c
[12:04:30] <hayley> In the article I am not always critical of C. After the infamous statement "I hate C with a passion", I say that if everything crashed as much as the author said it did, we would have few working computers.
[12:04:32] <White_Flame> it's pretty on-the-metal
[12:04:56] <White_Flame> but seriously, the _entire_ OS doesn't need to be in an asm equivalent
[12:05:04] <White_Flame> just interfaces to hardware & memory map level stuff
[12:05:49] <dave0> it's the most unsafe language that is used to write the most sensitive parts of the system
[12:06:18] <White_Flame> and yeah, having a compiler manage low level bits is much saner than manually writing every part of it
[12:14:09] <hayley> "#<CLEAVIR-IR:LEXICAL-LOCATION DOCUMENTATION182> has an attributed stack slot but no attributed register. Did you forget to call ENSURE-INPUT-AVAILABLE?"

[12:14:22] <hayley> Wait, I wrote that. Huh.

[12:17:42] <hayley> The error was also generated while compiling the hash table code I maintain ):
[12:18:38] <dave0> If any step in a program’s execution has undefined behavior, then the entire execution is without meaning. This is important: it’s not that evaluating (1<<32) has an unpredictable result, but rather that the entire execution of a program that evaluates this expression is meaningless. Also, it’s not that the execution is meaningful up to the point where undefined behavior happens: the bad effects can actually precede the unde

[20:56:29] <selwyn> the premier league has a dedicated ´fixture computer´ which is supposed to know all things and calculate match days appropriately
[20:57:31] <selwyn> which conjures up amusing images of a mid century computer the size of a house, that gets featured on national tv etc. 
[20:57:39] <selwyn> i like to think they have just been using a univac for 70 years
[21:00:14] <shka> univac? unlikely
[21:00:46] <shka> but there are still running transistors computers from the 70s and 80s and doing it's job
[21:01:54] <shka> issue is that the vacuum lamps are not exactly durable 
[21:02:06] <shka> and it is one thing to have two of those on the amp
[21:02:19] <shka> and completely different having computer made from those

[21:05:24] <shka> no burger for brits?
[21:14:11] <aeth> pjb: idk, plenty of things couldn't really be invented until later
[21:14:35] <aeth> Because of performance constraints on the hardware
[21:14:44] <aeth> In particular, graphics.
[21:15:17] <aeth> e.g. Phong shading dates to 1973-1975, but it took probably another 20 years to make that real time, and it's obsolete now.
[21:16:14] <aeth> And, sure, with the right institution in the 1970s-1980s, you could get a sneak peek into the graphical computing future, but most people didn't get there until the 1990s (even though they could have gotten there on home computers in the 1980s, to some extent)
[21:17:04] <aeth> Hyperlinks weren't really available until the 1980s, and outside of HyperCard nobody saw them until the 1990s.
[21:17:30] <aeth> The first Internet search engine, the Archie search engine, was written in 1990.
[21:18:15] <aeth> Version control dates to the 1970s, but version control that wasn't a complete mess didn't show up until decades later.
[21:18:17] *** Joins: OlCe (~user@lfbn-nic-1-123-149.w2-15.abo.wanadoo.fr)
[21:19:31] <aeth> I think just about everyone relies on (1) graphics, (2) decent version control, (3) hyperlinks, (4) search engines... none date to the 1960s. Xerox PARC didn't even invent the modern GUI until the 1970s.
[21:20:52] <aeth> Virtual reality wasn't really a thing in research until the 1980s. Touchscreens took a really long time to develop from the 1970s onward until they got usable, starting the 1980s or 1990s.
[21:22:11] <aeth> Consumers couldn't get a modern-ish touchscreen until the '00s, modern-ish VR until the '10s, hyperlinks outside of HyperCard until the '90s, a modern GUI until the '80s, 3D graphics until the '90s, etc.

[21:59:43] <selwyn> shka: i have noticed some rolling shortages, nothing really big
[21:59:46] <selwyn> but the news is ominous
[22:00:05] <selwyn> every exporter/importer seems to complain
[22:00:19] <shka> you do have remaining exporters? :D
[22:00:39] <selwyn> oh lol
[22:00:41] <selwyn> uh
[22:00:55] <selwyn> used to have shellfish, but not for a few months now
[22:01:41] <shka> makes sense
[22:06:06] <selwyn> because the wait at the border causes them to go stale
[22:06:38] <selwyn> there is plenty of herring in the sea, but it is exported to other places, enjoyed here only by the polish (i suspect)
[22:07:20] <ck_> https://mykeyboard.eu/ says "UK Orders below 135 GBP are on hold until further notice"

[22:07:27] <ck_> so it isn't just perishables. sad times
[22:07:56] * selwyn finally reads the article
[22:07:57] <selwyn> oh, this is a covid labour shortage, not a brexit one
[22:08:49] <selwyn> lots of trains are delayed/cancelled because the staff can´t come in as they are told to self isolate by an app
[22:08:56] <selwyn> yet the country reopens
[22:09:33] <ck_> look, if you want to stick the finger up to brussels, you're not going to submit to what an /app/ tells you
[22:09:38] <ck_> o/~ rule, b..
[22:10:24] <selwyn> the thing is, you can simply delete the app, it´s not compulsory to have it
[22:10:37] <ck_> even better. the three monkeys are never wrong
[22:10:54] <selwyn> anti-vaxxers have started a campaign to do precisely this, yet it remains in the top 10 most popular apps
[22:11:01] <shka> i've recently bought duckypad from UK
[22:11:09] <ck_> how long did it take to get to you?
[22:11:24] <shka> it came in by royal mail no problem
[22:11:42] <ck_> interesting. no tax charges?
[22:11:51] <shka> well, tax charge obviously 
[22:12:01] <shka> as for everything
[22:12:44] <shka> but this is small scale project, just one guy designing hardware 
[22:13:14] <shka> also, it is already quite expensive for what it is
[22:15:44] <selwyn> what does #lispcafe think about the european semiconductor ambitions
[22:17:26] <selwyn> duckypad does seem expensive. do you use it for emacs?
[22:17:50] <shka> not for emacs

[23:28:39] <shka> well, i guess that it is prime time to revise "import everything from asia" policy
[23:29:07] <shka> since the pandemic demonstrated that long supply chains are a real problem in time of the crisis
[23:29:26] <shka> just like that time flood in thailand caused shortage of HDDs
[23:43:07] <aeth> selwyn: In general, though, 3D comes about in the 80s (not real-time!) and really in the 90s in real-time. Networking develops in the late 80s to the point where you get basically the entire modern internet by the early 90s. VR experiments mostly in the 80s.
[23:43:14] <aeth> Touchscreens mostly really, really low quality and in the early 90s
[23:43:24] * SAL9000 has flashbacks to resistive touchscreens
[23:44:14] <aeth> (widespread encryption on networked communications took a while to happen, so I say "basically the entire modern internet" but... not quite. But that was a legal barrier, the right to encrypt communications and export software that encrypted)
[23:46:59] <aeth> (and also, machines were kinda too slow for that)
[23:47:29] <aeth> heh, WiFi precursor was 1971, though so... I guess you have that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi#History
[23:47:45] <aeth> I mean, if pjb said 70s not 80s, you arguably could say all of it was there
[23:48:10] <aeth> first mobile phone prototype 1973... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone#History
