[00:01:44] <sonny> the thing is, a programmer should have these concepts regardless of the language
[00:02:28] <sonny> C has a really big impact, so it is a bonus if you learn it at some point
[00:02:45] <[itchyjunk]> thats what i mean.
[00:02:55] <[itchyjunk]> this heap,stack nonesense seems important enough
[00:03:06] <sonny> I'm just thinking if I had your background it would be very low on my list of priorities
[00:03:06] <[itchyjunk]> and you don't come across it directly in java/py it seems
[00:03:20] <[itchyjunk]> if you had my background, you'ed be napping
[00:03:31] <sonny> you do, but you have to read more details to get an understanding
[00:03:43] <[itchyjunk]> i guess it is kinda low in the priority though
[00:03:53] <[itchyjunk]> i should probably be learning some more basic algebra and measure theory

[00:05:20] <nomagno> I try to avoid manual memory management in C
[00:05:20] <flakland> a*a + b*b = c*c
[00:05:25] <[itchyjunk]> you can use it to build theory of integration to get a more powerful thing
[00:05:35] <sonny> oh cool
[00:05:36] <[itchyjunk]> so instead of remann integration, you can use lebesgue integral
[00:05:38] <nomagno> not necessarily because I don't understand it, but because I'm not doing systems programming
[00:05:48] <[itchyjunk]> legesgue invented it for his phd thesis
[00:06:22] <nomagno> Most types of memory unsafety related to allocation in C can be refactored into pointer arguments
[00:06:28] <sonny> more familar with remann
[00:06:32] <nomagno> At least the dumb ones
[00:06:45] <[itchyjunk]> yeah reimann is how they teach you integration in first go
[00:06:59] <sonny> I want to do calc and stuff but foundational cs is such a big block for me lol
[00:07:00] <[itchyjunk]> but you need measure theory else you won't be able to study a large class of function
[00:07:03] <teut> lebesgue integration?
[00:07:08] <sonny> I need to get better at multitasking
[00:07:10] <[itchyjunk]> probablity theory is also formalized in measure theory
[00:07:19] <sonny> ah
[00:07:24] <[itchyjunk]> "distributions" makes sense in measure theory but not reimann
[00:07:37] <[itchyjunk]> so QM also uses some measure theory

[02:42:48] <sonny> just parse it
[02:42:54] <CartmanBrah> How?
[02:42:58] <sonny> doesn't it have an rfc?

[02:43:13] <sonny> email addresses
[02:43:42] <CartmanBrah> The regular expression to validate email addresses (possibly multiple in to:, cc: and bcc: form) (from RFC 822) is pretty beefy; definitely the longest non-trivial regular expression that I have seen.
[02:43:51] <CartmanBrah> https://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html
[02:43:56] <CartmanBrah> Mail::RFC822::Address: regexp-based address validation
[02:44:07] <CartmanBrah> That's a ridiculous regex.
[02:44:09] <sonny> no, not that one
[02:44:22] <sonny> the rfc that shows how an address is formed
[02:44:24] <CartmanBrah> I need to do it on command line with linux toolls
[02:44:30] <PlanckWalk> Yes, it's an autogenerated regex for a task that is barely within the capabilities of regexes at all
[02:44:36] <oldlaptop> You should probably read the actual RFC.
[02:44:46] <PlanckWalk> Use a proper parser for the grammar
[02:44:57] <CartmanBrah> so everyone who needs to parse an email out of a string needs to learn the RFC?
[02:45:03] <sonny> yeah
[02:45:03] <oldlaptop> (In clickbait mode, what's allowed may surprise you)
[02:45:05] <CartmanBrah> No.

[02:50:49] <PlanckWalk> C or Java for some things that are more complex
[02:51:29] <oldlaptop> I would still suggest you at least *look* at the RFC, so you understand what you're actually talking about. It is possible you actually need to be stricter, i.e. reject some class of valid email addresses.

[02:52:49] <CartmanBrah> That's not my scope and I don't have to worrya bout it.

[02:53:26] <CartmanBrah> I find what you say somewhat pendantic.
[02:53:34] <CartmanBrah> And needlessly beating a horse.
[02:53:40] <EdFletcher> if you use perl's Mail::RFC822::Address (which you linked), you could do this as a one-liner as it exposes a nice `valid()` function 
[02:53:50] <CartmanBrah> I was thinking that
[02:54:05] <oldlaptop> If you just want grep abuse@[a-z]+.com, you know where to find it.
[02:54:07] <CartmanBrah> I'll figure it out. Thanks for all the commetns folks.

[02:54:49] <EdFletcher> but, in the long run, as even the documentation for that module notes: "the only sure way to see if a supplied email address is genuine is to send an email to it and see if the user recieves (sic) it" 
[02:55:04] <EdFletcher> (e.g. don't parse; validate) 
[02:55:41] <EdFletcher> but obviously that isn't feasible for all use cases (including parsing through logs for addresses) 
[02:56:01] <sonny> hmm, is that something you can put in a rest api?
[02:56:22] <EdFletcher> oh for sure, would be trivial to wrap it up as an api 
[02:56:29] <sonny> yay

[02:57:27] <EdFletcher> 👍 
[02:58:37] <sonny> still, parsing would be an early optomization?
[02:58:43] <sonny> yikes
[02:59:04] <sonny> optimization*
[02:59:54] <EdFletcher> not so much an optimization as a fool's errand, you simply can't hope to properly parse the breadth of possible valid addresses. as someone noted earlier, it's fully against the limit of regex (may even be pushing past it: is email address grammar non-regular? if so, then a regex can _never_ parse it correctly!) 
[03:00:04] <sonny> that and caching the results
[03:00:12] <PlanckWalk> Yes, the full grammar is non-regular
[03:00:30] <EdFletcher> boom, there we go. no _regular_ expression will ever be able to properly parse the grammar. 
[03:00:44] *** Quits: Scottish-Guy (~Scottish-@87.75.170.167) (Quit: Bye)
[03:00:50] <PlanckWalk> Apparently if you ignore nested comments then it's regular.
[03:00:54] <sonny> non-regular is not a problem, I can still parse it
[03:01:06] *** Joins: OveRSeeR (~OveRSeeR_@87.75.170.167)
[03:01:09] <EdFletcher> ahhh gotcha, so we can down-scope it to make it regex parseable 
[03:01:30] <PlanckWalk> Yes, there are plenty of parsers that aren't just regexes
[03:01:33] <sonny> nested comments ?!
[03:01:37] <EdFletcher> sonny: yeah of course, a proper parser (as PlanckWalk also noted IIRC) can happily parse non-regular grammars, just not regular expressions 
[03:01:39] * sonny needs to read the rfc
[03:02:17] <EdFletcher> so again, the only _foolproof_ way to ensure if an email address is valid is to send an email to it 
[03:02:22] <sonny> sure a proper parser can handle regular grammars too
[03:02:24] <oldlaptop> sonny: (it is, again, more complicated than you probably think)
[03:02:33] <sonny> hmm
[03:03:12] <oldlaptop> the set of email addresses some random developer would look at and call valid is almost certainly *far* smaller than the set of addresses that actually are
[03:03:20] <PlanckWalk> Definitely
[03:03:22] <EdFletcher> and this isn't a contrived problem either: _every time_ someone tries to add email address validation to our system at work, it inevitably fails down the road on some wacky address and we yank the code again. annoying that it keeps happening honestly. 
[03:03:34] <EdFletcher> oldlaptop: 100% this

[09:43:58] <vdamewood> Well, Aluminum is an element, not an alloy.
[09:44:22] <InPhase> vdamewood: I would accept aluminum if it were textured.  There are a lot of very nice sturdy good-grip polymers as well.
[09:44:22] <sonny1> if the browser and camera are seperated from the phone I bet that would knock the price down a lot
[09:44:25] <flakland> lemme get some nickel titanium alloy phone
[09:44:39] <sonny1> vdamewood I doubt it's pure aluminum tho
[09:44:55] <sonny1> that would be so expensive
[09:45:27] <vdamewood> Well, at the very least aluminum oxidizes like crazy.
[09:45:41] <sonny1> oh
[09:45:52] <sonny1> yeah, that's not good
[09:45:55] <InPhase> I just think it would be great if I didn't need a phone case for my phone, because it was already designed with the case as its body.  For that, phone outsides should be TPU.
[09:46:07] <vdamewood> If you expose pure aluminum to the atmosphere it will be covered in a layer of aluminum oxide in 1 nanosecond or so.
[09:46:23] <vdamewood> sonny1: Actually, aluminum oxide is a wonderful material.
[09:46:27] <sonny1> InPhase me too
[09:46:49] <sonny1> vdamewood I thought oxidize and metal = rust
[09:46:51] <flakland> oh man, the scroll phone (patent pending)
[09:46:52] <vdamewood> sonny1: Aluminum oxide is a better covering than the aluminum itself.
[09:46:56] <InPhase> You want the outside of a phone to be a sturdy but slightly squishy material to absorb shock damage.
[09:47:12] <sonny1> TPU sounds like plastic
[09:47:25] <InPhase> It is a sturdy and slightly squishy plastic.
[09:47:31] <vdamewood> sonny1: Aluminum oxide is weird this way.
[09:47:39] <sonny1> yeah, I want to avoid plastic as much as possible
[09:47:55] <InPhase> sonny1: Not if you want a durable phone.
[09:48:26] <sonny1> "rails" could be an accesory if that's a problem maybe
[09:48:30] <InPhase> A hard phone is not durable.  The outside will either shatter or transfer all shock damage into the phone.
[09:48:59] <vdamewood> Aluminum oxide pretty much forms a protective coating on the aluminum underneath, and it doesn't oxidize further after that initial layer.
[09:49:08] <sonny1> oh
[09:49:16] <InPhase> People have the basic physics all backwards.  Most people seem to be trying to buy hard cases to protect their phone better, and then their phones keep breaking.

[10:33:51] <CoJaBo> I don't have a windows desktop =D
[10:33:55] <vdamewood> Apple removed the Trash icon from the desktop 22 years ago.
[10:34:05] <sonny1> CoJaBo VAuthMSgina?
[10:34:36] <sonny1> know what's weird, freedesktop trash spec ... it just moves the files to somewhere in your homedir
[10:34:45] <InPhase> vdamewood: They just expanded it to encompass the whole system.
[10:34:55] <sonny1> lol
[10:35:04] <vdamewood> sonny1: That's basically how it works on macOS.
[10:35:20] <sonny1> yeah, that sucks

[10:35:33] <vdamewood> sonny1: Why?
[10:35:36] <CoJaBo> “Sorry the internet is slow guys, I accidentally moved a 2.2TB file to trash instead of deleting it”
[10:35:39] <sonny1> should've been a $tmp location
[10:36:18] <CoJaBo> Amazingly, IIRC, this is one of the few things Windows actually got right, that nobody then copied :/
[10:36:25] <sonny1> basically that
[10:36:54] <sonny1> takes up space in home, and slow file operations affect home
[10:37:27] <sonny1> I only noticed cause I was running out of space once
[10:37:44] <sonny1> I looked at a chart of my homedir and I was like what the ?!
[10:37:46] <vdamewood> sonny1: Well, on macOS it moves to a .Trash directory (or something like that), but where the .Trash directory is depends on where you moved the file from.
[10:37:56] <InPhase> CoJaBo: Xfce has a Windows-style trash icon.  Although I pretty much never use it.  I primarily manipulate files by terminal.
[10:38:28] <sonny1> I propose to add Trash at FS layer
[10:38:30] <InPhase> vdamewood: Oh those .Trash directories are terrible...  They're constantly getting bundled into zip files or onto thumb drives.
[10:38:37] <CoJaBo> I have not even ever started the file manager on this laptop
[10:39:04] <vdamewood> InPhase: zip files?

[10:40:06] <InPhase> Yeah, that one.
[10:40:23] <vdamewood> InPhase: Yeah, I *think* that one is gone since macOS no longer uses the resource fork.
[10:40:26] <InPhase> Like graffiti slapped all over anything the OS touched.
[10:41:03] <vdamewood> Yeah, that's annoying even to us macOS users.

[10:42:43] <InPhase> Well, I hope they really did get rid of it.  Maybe by the time everyone gets systems upgraded that will be gone.
[10:45:08] <vdamewood> InPhase: I just tried to 'Compress' a folder. It didn't make any junk extra files.
[10:47:19] <InPhase> Did you check on a non-mac OS?
[10:47:39] <vdamewood> No, I used unzip -l
[10:47:55] <InPhase> Ok.
[10:48:02] <vdamewood> So, I used Finder (the GUI) to compress it, and the command-line tool to check.
[10:48:41] <vdamewood> Want me to try it on Linux?
[10:48:52] <InPhase> I know I have gotten multiple mac zip files with garbage extras in the past year, but these might have been from older systems than yours.
[10:49:08] <vdamewood> I'm on Release n-1.
[10:49:20] <vdamewood> I should upgrade.
[10:49:21] <InPhase> I don't know where they come from, as these were things people sent to me.
[10:51:00] <vdamewood> Mac OS 9- could hold two separate bit streams in a single file. One of them was called the 'resource fork', this had things like file icons and other support data. macOS (OS X) continued to support the separate fork for backwards compatibility. The junk files are its way to save the data in zip, which didn't support resource forks directly.
[10:51:37] <deniska> __MACOSX__ is just a pretentious version of thumbs.db
[10:51:46] <vdamewood> Basically, yeah.

[10:52:52] <vdamewood> InPhase: I just realized my SSD is formatted Apple FS which doesn't support resource forks (I think0 which might be why. HFS(+) still supports forks, since it's the FS used on 9.
[10:53:32] <vdamewood> Apple suggests HFS+ for hard drives, and APFS for SSDs. That might be why they have the garbage files and I don't.

[11:14:07] <deniska> sonny1: n typically means "amount of input data", and there's not much of input data here really
[11:14:28] <sonny1> I take n to be the size of the range
[11:14:56] <deniska> n only makes sense as an n, if n can meaningfully grow
[11:14:57] <sonny1> so the outmost loop iterates n times
[11:15:36] <deniska> can you make configs.MAX_SF 10 times bigger for it to be meaningful? Maybe, dunno, I'm not familiar with what they're doing :)
[11:16:01] <sonny1> it's an interesting problem
[11:16:15] <sonny1> I really think you would just use 5 different vars
[11:16:16] <squid_game> I am confused, how do you define the big o notation if the variables (range in loop) are not equal
[11:16:33] <squid_game> if one loop itterates 3 times, the other loop itterates 100 times, etc.
[11:16:51] <squid_game> is it still n^(nest nr)?
[11:16:52] <sonny1> I just gave each loop a name
[11:17:11] <deniska> squid_game: you can give each value its own letter, but it's rarely useful
[11:17:50] <sonny1> isn't much else to do
[11:18:22] <deniska> even asking "what big-O of this thing?" is often useful, but not always
[11:18:35] <squid_game> deniska, then it gets more confusing to say O(a*b*c*d*e) complexity and has more meaning with O(n^5)
[11:18:36] <deniska> not too useful for example if you never expect the input size to change
[11:18:57] <sonny1> squid_game what do you think O(n^5) is?
[11:19:08] <sonny1> it's just O(n*n*n*n*n)
[11:19:13] <squid_game> true
[11:19:23] <squid_game> in that sense, it is not really n^5 :)

[11:21:08] <sonny1> what else is there?
[11:21:09] <squid_game> in my 5 nested loop, changing a range from 2 to 4 has a major impact
[11:21:12] <deniska> squid_game: only if the sizes of ranges meaningfully depend on some value which can change
[11:22:35] <deniska> if they all change "in sync" then sure, it's O(n^5) thing you have here

[18:20:23] <maxzor> It can be used as a common denominator to ship software, but it is by definition not specialized, so it duplicates the work with package manager maintainers
[18:21:18] <Decker> not really the package managers are for distribution; creating a package should be part of the build system...
[18:21:20] <maxzor> or rather, the current CPackDeb generator is not specialized enough for Debian
[18:21:28] <Decker> and really is; unless you run it manually - then it's still in the chain

[19:13:31] <nomagno> Package managers wo
[19:13:38] <Athas> In Unix it's oddly difficult for a program to find the location of its own executable, which is necessary to have the kind of "self-contained" programs that are fairly common on Windows.  (At least if the program has any data files.)
[19:13:42] <pulse> The best way to deliver Windows apps, like I've said before, is portable, self contained ZIP
[19:13:45] <nomagno> package managers don't usually put files in unexpected places
[19:13:48] <pulse> That is the #1 sane way
[19:13:53] <nomagno> it is formally specified, the Freedesktop spec

[19:14:25] <Decker> Athas /proc/self/maps has your path
[19:14:25] <pulse> If I do the same guess what, all deps are self contained in the same folder as the game
[19:14:28] <pulse> It's easy, it's simple. It works

[21:43:18] <deniska> pyzozord: react has a small scope, it's fairly unopinionated, and it has like 4 dependencies
[21:43:22] <oldlaptop> sonny: microcomputer BASICs (including AIUI that included with the IBM PC) were mostly in ROM
[21:43:50] <GeDaMo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_BASIC
[21:44:00] <deniska> it's basically a wrapper over document.createElement :)

[21:47:37] *** Joins: ShockTohp (~kevin@155.138.224.160)
[21:47:39] <pyzozord> Meaning real DOM code is written in c++/rust and the react's vdom is written in js, which theoretically should be slower. But in pratice real dom does so much more work
[21:48:08] <deniska> pyzozord: when you modificate real DOM, it often fire layout engine
[21:48:11] <deniska> fires*
[21:48:48] <pyzozord> yeah but you could theoretically create a bunch of nodes and never connect them to the document, so they wouldn't trigger layout recomputes

[22:36:30] <quartz> Here is the code, the problem is at line 64 https://bpa.st/PVGA

[22:38:36] <sonny> quartz the compiler is correct
[22:39:30] <sonny> probably just have to use a loop

[23:06:27] <sonny> I meant behind the binary tree in a database
[23:06:40] <node1> Where one member make two other memeber(2 childs ).  And these way parent child will make a chain.
[23:07:27] <sonny> yeah that seems totally fine
[23:08:36] <node1> Yes i' want to make it using website. But not sure how to store these concept(binary tree like ) data into relational database.
[23:09:09] <buzzard> i posted some C code here the a few days ago as i was having trouble copying memory into a malloc'ed buffer within a function.  i figured it out and it turns out that i needed to use *buffer + index * length rather than buffer[idx * length].  i'm super rusty in C but i thought those were basically equivalent.

[23:32:36] <nitrix> *buffer + index * length is dereferencing buffer, which was pointing at the first member of the array. It's essentially obtaining the value at buffer[0].
[23:33:07] <nitrix> Adding idx*length after that doesn't make sense anymore, you're no longer doing pointer arithmetic, you're working with a value from the array.
