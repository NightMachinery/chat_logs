[00:01:15] <dfcnvt> skyfall: You are trying to figure out a way to praise the article by pointing out their styled way of phrasing?
[00:04:58] <dfcnvt> Maybe praise's a wrong word -- but it's what you are noticing of...
[00:05:26] <dfcnvt> (Sorry -- not really what you wanted to hear but just grammarticallywise on which is correct)
[00:07:51] <dfcnvt> skyfall: Okay, "does" just mean, it points that it what it does.   Whereas, "makes" has a bit different meaning, an articile MAKES a better jobs...It's as if by reading makes you a better job of improving your speeches.  See the difference?
[00:09:24] <dfcnvt> "That article does a better job"  << It gives credits to what make the article best
[00:10:47] <dfcnvt> "That article makes a better job" << It claim the article causes something in an improvement of speeches, in this case, a way to phrase things, a styled sort.  But I emphasis "improvement".
[00:10:54] <dfcnvt> ....Does is the word you want...
[00:10:58] <dfcnvt> I'll shut up.
[00:13:15] <dfcnvt> Although, I'd take a look at the whole reading and figured out what's the goal in writing this?  Then maybe there's a need to revise in the writing other than the concern of which word 'does' or 'makes' is most correct.
