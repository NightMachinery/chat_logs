[00:33:54] <johnjaye> hm. question. if lisp code and lisp data are the same, and parsers and combinators are so easy to write
[00:34:14] <johnjaye> then shouldn't all the schemes/lisps/whatevers have parsers to run every library in every system?

[00:40:39] <gwatt> 1) different schemes provide different basic libraries, even if they also conform to the same standard. 2) different lisps have different semantics. 3) racket has divested itself of being a scheme.
[00:41:07] <johnjaye> racket isn't scheme? when did this happen
[00:41:30] <johnjaye> i'm building racket to run scheme right now in fact
[00:43:04] <gwatt> racket still definitely looks a lot like scheme, and some of the simpler examples are probably portable, but racket decided to not tie itself to the scheme standards so they could go their own way
[00:44:31] <gwatt> I know there are r5rs and r6rs #langs for racket, so you can still use it as a scheme, but it's not racket's goal to be a scheme
[00:45:08] <gwatt> but, probably around 2010 when plt-scheme renamed to racket
[00:50:12] <Zipheir> johnjaye: lisp code and lisp data are the same?

[00:51:13] <johnjaye> ah ok
[00:51:53] <johnjaye> i'm guessing the real answer is any such interpreter would be super slow

[01:34:52] <johnjaye> so parens just specify macro args unambiguously?
[02:04:26] <Zipheir> johnjaye: The nice thing about s-expressions is that the whole form is denoted by a single list.  I don't have to keep the rest of the parse tree around to make sense of it.

[02:47:44] <Zipheir> johnjaye: With S-exps, a single form is easy to "pick out" and pass to the expander.  With e.g. JS syntax, you'd probably have to interleave parsing and expansion, so there's a parsing context to keep track of.
[02:48:10] <Zipheir> At least, that's how it works with Template Haskell.
[02:48:34] <Zipheir> I don't know.  There are probably better ways to do it.  S-exps sure are convenient, though.

[03:38:30] <Zipheir> Interesting.
[03:38:41] <drakonis> it's why racket's repl is bad
[03:38:49] <drakonis> repl experience
[03:38:56] <Zipheir> "it's basically that the top-level is hopeless -- interactive redefinition can't be given a consistent semantics"  So let's investigate the semantics of a system with interactive redefinition!
[03:39:47] * Zipheir remembers the stack of papers relating to reflection yet to read.
[03:40:54] <Zipheir> The toplevel is a great unexplored frontier.
[03:41:12] <samth> drakonis: the deal is what all those links say

[22:53:48] <tokie> this is a really interesting case in implementing syntax-rules: (define-syntax zip-mult (syntax-rules () [(_ (x x* ...) (y y* ...)) (+ (* x y) (* x* y*) ...)]))
[22:54:26] <tokie> if i do something like (zip-mult (10 20 30 40) (10 20 30)) both chezscheme and chicken's errors kinda imply they might do multiple expansions and then try to merge the lists, and error if they're the wrong length

[23:01:01] <tokie> wow, chibi just ignores the extra x, lol
[23:01:56] <tokie> x* that is
[23:02:49] <gwatt> what does chicken do in the case of (map + '(1 2 3 4) '(1 2 3)) ?
[23:03:43] <tokie> (2 4 6)
[23:03:56] <tokie> map doesn't appear to be a macro, though
[23:04:33] <gwatt> It's not, but I was wondering if ... expansion was naively implemented in terms of map
[23:05:00] <gwatt> which might still be the case in chibi, whereas chicken does a length check
[23:08:01] <tokie> r7small doesn't really say what to do except "It is an error if the output cannot be built up as specified"
[23:08:12] <tokie> and in this case i could see someone going either way

[23:12:09] <gwatt> Looking at chibi's github, there are no issues made about this, nor are there explicit tests for this behavior. It may be worthwhile to ask if this is intended
[23:23:13] <Zipheir> tokie: How far you can "push" ... expansion is an interesting corner of syntax-rules, indeed.
[23:23:31] <Zipheir> The standard is a little hard to decipher on that point, for me at least.
[23:24:48] <sham1> syntax-case is not coming soon enough

[23:25:46] <tokie> i'm in the middle of implementing expansion of ... and the most natural thing to do would result in chibi's behavior
