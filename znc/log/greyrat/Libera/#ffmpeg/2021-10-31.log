[08:11:05] <newbie2021> Hello, guys. I am doing "ffmpeg -i 1.mkv -map 0 -map -0:a:1 -c copy 2.mkv" and, after it is done, i get "0.057118%" message. Will it make video unplayable or dissynchronize audio and video or something?
[08:11:23] <newbie2021> "muxing overhead: 0.057118%"
[08:17:26] <DeHackEd> it means that the file is this much larger than just the raw video and audio combined
[08:18:38] <DeHackEd> so the mkv container is using that much additional space... which is actually pretty decent...
[08:19:27] <DeHackEd> umm... from your commandline you're muxing everyting in the file, and then an audio channel... again?
[08:20:34] <newbie2021> DeHackEd: i am deleting 2nd audiostream from the file. It's a movie with Russian translation and English original audio. I am deleting English original audio.
[08:21:03] <DeHackEd> oh I didn't notice the - my bad

[12:26:41] <Amoz> Hi, I'm trying to capture old VHS tapes with a videodevice. Because this is a pretty slow computer and I cant filter/compress in realtime, I'd like to first capture it in "lossless" so I can later on encode/compress,filter etc. in a bulk run. Is there a way to capture it in a somewhat compressed,lossless codec so it's not generating those superhuge filesizes, while not overloading CPU and dropping frames?
[12:32:22] <System_Error> I've captured some things to vp8 from cam/screen, relatively fast to encode. Its lossy but on high enough bitrate it isnt big prob. May want to experiment with some other codecs tho.

[12:33:31] <furq> if you don't care about intra only then x264 lossless is pretty fast and efficient

[12:46:47] <Amoz> furq, what does intra only mean? pseudocommand would be something like -v:c libx264 -crf 0 -tune film or so?
[12:48:59] *** Quits: Yonle (~Yonle@user/yonle) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[12:49:11] <furq> -c:v libx264 -qp 0 -preset superfast
[12:49:18] <furq> -tune does nothing for lossless
[12:50:20] <furq> if you want to edit your intermediates with an NLE then you generally want intra only
[12:50:34] <furq> it lets you seek to frames much faster
[12:50:42] <furq> if you don't care about that then it's just a waste of space
[12:50:58] <JEEB> there was a test done circa 2008-10 or so that noted that you can still use a 3 frame GOP for fast scrubbing
[12:51:12] <JEEB> and CPU speeds have gone up since then :)
[12:51:27] <JEEB> although for lossless the options are limited anyways, if that's what's needed
[12:51:40] <JEEB> since support for lossless (esp. RGB) H.264 is not often there
[12:51:42] <furq> it sounds like he doesn't care about that anyway
[12:52:00] <JEEB> sure, just wanted to mention since you mentioend all-intra for editor scrubbing
[12:55:20] <Amoz> to clarify, my goal is to improve upon my current command where I'm essentially doing everything realtime. But I'd like to deinterlace it and maybe experiment a bit with hqdn3d filter (which was mentioned in a guide). Here's my current command https://pastebin.com/ewwNd3Qr
[12:56:29] <Amoz> sort of what I'm expecting is to have 2 phases (capture + filter/compress), if that would give me any improvement in the final file.
[12:57:48] <Amoz> does that make sense or am I chasing <10% improvements in quality/size ?
[12:59:11] <furq> capturing to an intermediate absolutely makes sense
[12:59:53] <furq> for starters you don't want to have to load up the vhs again if you got your settings wrong
[13:00:38] <furq> it won't necessarily give an improvement but it gives you a lot more flexibility if you have the disk space to store intermediates
[13:10:40] <Amoz> thanks for the info. Someone mentioned that vcodec x264rgb should be used, is that just to keep the full colorspace or something?

[13:18:27] <Amoz> true.
[13:18:34] <furq> -s and -r are noops there anyway
[13:19:07] <Amoz> due to -qp 0 ?

[13:26:01] <Amoz> Thanks a lot!
[13:26:50] <furq> you can save a bit of space with -c:a flac but not much
[13:30:33] <Amoz> I have 5 tapes to capture, but hopefully I'll have enough of space for it. I'll just have to make sure one is finished before i start with the next one if I dont have space for all of the raw captures.

[15:09:23] <Arifd> Hi guys, so I prototyped an algorithm using ffmpeg then rebuilt it in Rust... Amazing! My Rust program pulls in the webcam, processes, then writes to stdout, then I pipe it into ffplay.
[15:09:41] <Arifd> Does anyone have an idea why over time latency appears to increase?
[15:10:50] <Arifd> My ffplay args are: -f rawvideo -pixel_format rgb24 -video_size 640x360
[15:13:53] <JEEB> it wouldn't be a surprise if a player that does attempt to keep to some frame rate/vsync ends up with a gradually increasing latenc
[15:17:53] <Arifd> Is there a way to say "don't worry about framerate... just play the most recent video frame"?
[15:18:15] <JEEB> up to the player
[15:18:21] <Arifd> it's ffplay
[15:18:25] <JEEB> ffplay I have no idea, it's a proof of concept :)
[15:18:37] <Arifd> but isn't it just the same as ffmpeg/
[15:18:39] <Arifd> ?
[15:18:46] <JEEB> nope
[15:18:50] <Arifd> oh
[15:19:23] <JEEB> FFmpeg is a set of APIs, and ffprobe|ffmpeg|ffplay are API clients
[15:20:14] <Arifd> right
[15:21:00] <Arifd> So I think what you are saying is that how ffplay choses to play the video / stay in sync is an implementation detail, that isn't covered by FFmpeg (libav?)
[15:21:46] <JEEB> whether you attempt to follow the given timestamps or do whatever else is what the API client decides to do
[15:22:21] <JEEB> anyways, to test the theory you can check something like the low latency profile in mpv
[15:22:37] <JEEB> I don't recall the exact parameters for raw input but the manual should cover it

[16:24:50] <thebombzen> for real-time recording/streaming from a remote device, is there anything better than H.264 inside mpegts?
[16:25:31] <thebombzen> libx264 superfast tune zerolatency inside mpegts "works" but I was wondering if there was a better way to do it
[16:26:08] <thebombzen> the use case is a wireless RC car kinda thing, streaming from its camera to the base station
[16:26:45] <thebombzen> the onboard camera is a cheap webcam that records mjpeg, but the bitrate is too high for the transmission and will need to be transcoded
[16:49:48] <furq> there's not really one answer to that
[16:50:16] <furq> if you're rate limited then hevc or av1 are good but i can't imagine that's viable

[17:26:28] <JEEB> thebombzen: depends on your definition of "better". mpeg-ts has timestamp wrap-around, so you might want to look into streamed matroska (I think it's slightly better in the "what if I just kill the muxing process before it has finished writing" department - which is where mpeg-ts generally excels)
[17:27:02] <JEEB> mostly because mpeg-ts is literally just 188 byte packets coming one after another
