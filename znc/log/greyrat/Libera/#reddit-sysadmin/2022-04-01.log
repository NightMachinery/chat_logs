[00:08:23] <Telgareith> yea
[00:08:29] <Hunterkll> i'd bloody well hope so

[00:09:01] <Telgareith> no
[00:10:06] <Hunterkll> i mean
[00:10:11] <Telgareith> I skimmed over Linus's petabyte of flash video and as far as I can tell looking at NEMA charts and running numbers, the 3kw each PSUs would pull >14.5A at full load with 208v

[00:10:24] <Hunterkll> sure
[00:10:25] <Telgareith> and the NEMA is a 3 phase arrangement

[02:04:31] <Hunterkll> @onenerdyguy i use xbox game bar for screen recording, for example, i use the built in sticky notes app, I use snip & sketch (the replacement for snipping tool - snipping tool is gone), even notepad is updated via it
[02:04:48] <Hunterkll> the keyboard lighting control software i use, my headset control software also only available via it
[02:04:58] <Hunterkll> nvidia control panel updated via it
[02:05:12] <Hunterkll> windows terminal updated via it
[02:05:16] <int0x1C8> you can get RDP client on Home edition through the store too
[02:05:28] <Hunterkll> windows subsystem for android via it :P
[02:06:36] <Hunterkll> intel thunderbolt control center updates via it.... installed opensuse via it.... intune company portal..... dolby atmos extensions for my headphones.... arduino IDE via it.... etc etc
[02:07:22] <int0x1C8> WSL ubuntu
[02:07:35] <Hunterkll> fuck even the built in calculator updates via it
[02:08:20] <Hunterkll> the only time they include any inbox apps in CUs is if there's a security issue (they did this a few times for 8.1, hilarious since work security guy had us remove all the "store" apps since they couldn't be updated.... we had to re-load them on all machines via some fucky deployment so that security patches could apply that month)
[02:08:43] <bomb> calculators are important man
[02:08:53] <JollyRgrs> which is why i continue to tell my stupid company why we need enterprise licenses or they need to decide to stop blocking the store via SRPs
[02:08:55] <bomb> numbers = money
[02:09:53] <int0x1C8> Hunterkll, you probably know this, does windows calculator have a RPN mode?
[02:10:34] <int0x1C8> I have a RPN calculator app on my phone and I've gotten so used to it
[02:10:39] <int0x1C8> it really is more efficient
[02:10:50] <JollyRgrs> int0x1C8: i don't think it does
[02:11:08] <JollyRgrs> my dad had a calculator (the ones with the running paper printer thing) that did that... he used it while he was in banking
[02:11:15] <JollyRgrs> but i don't see any setting for it in calc.exe

[02:12:30] <JollyRgrs> lol... the idea is neat, and fits well in certain applications
[02:12:36] <Hunterkll> int0x1C8: I just use an HP-49G+ ;)

[08:39:53] <SirSceptalot> what was so illegal about his payment scheme?
[08:42:46] <yuken> SirSceptalot, paid once monthly. Required pay is to be twice monthly at a minimum.
[08:43:51] <SirSceptalot> is that a special contract or something, or is that normal in the states? Here once per month is the norm
[08:44:07] <yuken> Normal, SirSceptalot. Illegal to do otherwise.

[08:44:35] <yuken> SirSceptalot, see, I'm not trying to find things that are a big deal. I'm trying to find the ltitle nit-picky things to say "Hi, my lawyer will be contacting you at this time."
[08:45:31] <SirSceptalot> https://c.tenor.com/HN_3dUgNxfoAAAAC/murica-rocky.gif
[08:46:02] <yuken> SirSceptalot, it's ruthless here. You don't act just as ruthless to these corporations, they will fuck you over.
[08:46:24] <yuken> I already asked where it was once, and will wait until the following first business day of the next week until I contact legal counsel and such.
[08:48:37] <SirSceptalot> idk how big that paycheck is, but aren't you more likely to spend on the lawyer than you're going to get from the paycheck?
[08:48:43] <yuken> SirSceptalot, yes.
[08:48:48] <yuken> Paycheck should be, at my rate, $1950.
[08:48:52] <yuken> Since it's a half.
[08:49:25] <yuken> SirSceptalot, but - filing a claim is free, and requesting compensation over going to court is common and usually done just to shut the guy up.
[08:49:36] <yuken> But, I'll gladly waste money to go scorched Earth.

[08:50:53] <SirSceptalot> this was the hardware store, right?
[08:51:01] <yuken> no, lol.
[08:51:29] <yuken> SirSceptalot, that JavaScript position. I arrived way too late one day without phone on me, so couldn't call them, after having to walk.
[08:51:39] <yuken> Got laid off the next morning.
[08:51:48] <SirSceptalot> oh, thought you still worked there
[08:51:57] <yuken> I never did!
[08:52:03] <SirSceptalot> lol
[08:52:07] <yuken> Retail (pharmacy/small market store) -> warehouse -> that job.
[08:52:24] <yuken> but SirSceptalot I'm just trying to be as ruthless as possible and squeeze him of every last penny I can. American way and such, but also hehe.
[08:53:50] <Molnija> yuken: which state?
[08:55:28] <yuken> Molnija, Ohio. Payment must be made within 15 days, or the normal pay date, or whichever is earlier. It's the latter (14 days today). At this point, once I file a claim, he has 60 days to respond before it's criminal.
[08:55:38] <yuken> But, I'm seeing if there's anything else I can add on to it, and see if there's an actual small lawsuit I could make of it.
[08:55:51] <yuken> Just the tiny little things that could have been broken, that pile up :P.

[10:36:07] <JollyRgrs> a HUGE time sink if you let it be
[10:36:16] <JollyRgrs> but i run my whole house on it pretty much
[10:36:37] <JollyRgrs> turn on the oculus? (kids gotta use it in the living room), the living room lights come on and at 100% (needed for tracking)

[10:40:08] <JollyRgrs> i use the google nest mini speakers for a lot of the manually triggered front-end
[10:40:31] <JollyRgrs> yeah, YAML isn't so bad, just use a good editor and you catch YAML format mistakes pretty easily
[10:41:05] <JollyRgrs> for example, my morning routine (triggered by an android alarm) will turn on my desk lamps, turn on my office computer (WOL) and do a few other things
[10:41:43] <JollyRgrs> for "goodnight" i have it send ssh command to shut down my PC, turn off all lights in the house and just a dim light in the bedroom to see until I am fully ready for nitenite
[10:42:55] <JollyRgrs> when all the houselights are off and it is after sunset, i have these decorative LEDs on vines around the windows and under the counter... they get dimmed into "nite lite" mode and turn back on normal brightness in the morning
[10:45:58] <Kiernian|Work> That's awesome
[10:46:08] <Kiernian|Work> ahh, I miss WoL.
[10:46:19] <Kiernian|Work> I no longer run enough "occasional use" boxes to require it.
[10:47:39] <JollyRgrs> i shut down my desktop... sometimes i can hear stupid things at night... like if a fan is ticking lightly or if the speakers mess up and i forgot to mute them
[10:47:55] <JollyRgrs> and my old setup had issues, so i just shutterdown when i went to bed
[10:48:02] <JollyRgrs> i never changed the habit
[10:48:34] <JollyRgrs> but... windows also has a hell of a time sleeping and turning off my screens... so the only option would be to hibernate or shut down
[10:48:49] <JollyRgrs> i've had too many issues coming out of hibernate for as much crap as i keep open... so i just shut down
[10:49:28] <JollyRgrs> kinda nice when i just just go "hey google, turn on office computer" or hit a button in home assistant (or technically i could also go into the google home app and turn it on there like a switch)
[10:51:54] <JollyRgrs> wait....
[10:52:07] <JollyRgrs> uh.... i just learnted ttps://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/critical-notifications/#android-text-to-speech-alarm-stream-max-volume
[10:52:17] <JollyRgrs> I can make a TTS notification speak at max volume!
[10:53:02] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> yeah that makes sense, would be cool to have everything start up at runtime
[10:54:22] <JollyRgrs> yeah... like even for me, i have an audio mixer that i put on a smart switch that I use for my mic... that turns on automatically when the system detects power draw levels on another smart switch that my desktop is on
[10:54:28] <JollyRgrs> turn it off the same way
[10:55:16] <JollyRgrs> wife was given this cheap-o RGB desk mat (she already has a better one) so I got it... it's just USB powered and I didn't want to take up a spot on my desktop (no room anyways)... so it also gets turned on/off with the audio mixer now

[16:55:27] <interop_madness> I could need some help with a reverse proxy problem. IIS acts as a reverse proxy via UrlRewrite. everything works fine, except when the target webservice responds with a HTTP redirect and a Location header. Location headers get rewritten by IIS in all cases, I only want them to be rewritten if the hostname of the Location header is equal to the target host's hostname. web.config: https://paste.ee/r/nxJbR/0
[16:56:49] <interop_madness> So, if the target webservice responds with Location: https://targethost.contoso.com:18001/foo/bar, it's fine if it gets rewritten to https://reverseproxy.contoso.com/foo/bar. but if the target webservice responds with Location: https://www.google.com, I want the header to remain untouched
[16:57:25] <interop_madness> So the question here is: how to introduce a rule to that effect?
[16:59:20] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> first problem: you're using IIS as a reverse proxy
[16:59:29] <Kiernian> wouldn't that be the pattern in here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/url-rewrite-module/creating-rewrite-rules-for-the-url-rewrite-module ?
[16:59:43] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> and yes, you'd put in a pattern in the proxy rule via regex
[17:00:01] <fritzwastaken> Whoooooooa Just got a new set of pictures
[17:00:06] <fritzwastaken> These racks are fuuuuucked
[17:00:06] <interop_madness> Ii can't influence the choice of IIS
[17:00:14] <monr0e> interop_madness: <host>:<port>/<path>. Use HTTP_HOST in your condition module.

[17:01:27] <Kiernian> i was waiting for someone to mention the built in kernel-level functionality :D
[17:01:36] <interop_madness> monr0e, can you elaborate based on the web.config? I'm a total UrlRewrite noob, sadly. This problem landed in my lap

[17:02:32] <Kiernian> the doc I linked has an example, interop_madness.
[17:02:40] <Kiernian> about 5/6 of the way down in the XML boxes
[17:02:42] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> interop, you've basically got a full hardocded match rule right now taht states 'anything with a . in it, send over to targethost.contoso.com

[17:03:33] <monr0e> interop_madness: Actually yes, the example in Kiernian's link is functional

[17:04:34] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> spring framework is everywhere
[17:05:17] <Kiernian> I think I've only touched url rewrites in IIS like, two or three times, but they're thankfully pretty straightforward
[17:05:27] <monr0e> They can get a bit messy
[17:05:27] <estranger> sloth_on_meth see my comment above
[17:05:28] <interop_madness> Ok so I need to configure match url="<Urls that start with Url of Reverse Proxy>" right?
[17:05:39] <estranger> tldr, it's less, but still bad
[17:05:45] <misspwn> mornin
[17:05:51] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> Think of it as an if-then statement
[17:05:57] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> if url = conditions, then send over here
[17:06:07] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> so you need to determine what those conditions are, and then craft a url filter that matchs them
[17:06:41] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> BUT, one thing to be aware of
[17:07:04] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you don't want to hardcode a full path lke you did as the target. Cuz what hapens then when someone bookmarks a nested page or the like, it's just gonna redirect you back to the root
[17:07:40] <interop_madness> Yeah, I don't get it
[17:07:46] <monr0e> On occasion, though, this is intentional behaviour - so adjust your approach to the application in question
[17:08:19] <interop_madness> I tried match url="https://reverseproxy.contoso.com(.*)" but that ends up 404
[17:08:35] <Molnija> lelllll
[17:08:50] <interop_madness> again, completely(!) clueless about rewrite rules.
[17:09:06] <interop_madness> I know regex but this seems to have some additional layers
[17:09:10] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> ok so
[17:09:37] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> your condition you put in there basically means 'any file that is at https://reverseproxy.contoso.com/ that then has a . in it"
[17:09:47] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> so you'd have to have a file like 'target.htm or something at the end of that url to fire
[17:09:51] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> So I post this probably once a year... but when your getting your oil changed.. do NOT use a fram oil filter on anything you love

[17:10:41] <interop_madness> wait, o​nenerdyguy, I was under the assumption, that (.*) reads as regex
[17:11:14] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> you know, in a perfect world, it would
[17:11:18] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> but this is microsofot, so fuck you

[17:42:37] <monr0e> interop_madness: Try this. I don't have IIS in front of me to test it, but it should theoretically work for root domains. Now you just need to add variables for the path: https://paste.ee/r/dJhqa

[17:46:53] <interop_madness> monr0e, no sorry
[17:46:56] <interop_madness> but thanks
[17:47:41] <monr0e> Probably needs some finess to account for the port
[17:48:01] <interop_madness> What bugs me is that I understand regular expressions; that I can successfully match the urls with the test tool and it outputs exactly what I expect; but then, the actual request to the reverse proxy 404s (on the IIS side)
[17:48:51] <monr0e> Can you make a raw request directly to the reverse proxy?
[17:48:56] <estranger> regex is black magic, like pki
[17:49:08] <PublicWiFi> IM HERE
[17:49:15] <estranger> parties over
[17:49:17] <monr0e> You have a problem. You solve it with Regex. You now have two problems
[17:49:22] <PublicWiFi> ^
[17:50:01] <interop_madness> monr0e, yes, I'm using fiddler
[17:50:12] <interop_madness> it's a bona fide IIS standard 404 error page
[17:50:51] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> @felda thanks for the tip on stopping nausea.
[17:50:59] <monr0e> What I mean is, can you type the address that you;re redirecting to in a browser and get the expected page? No tools, no bullshot
[17:51:26] <interop_madness> no the reverse proxy's target is behind a firewall
[17:51:51] <monr0e> Then you don't have all the tools you need to test your results
[17:52:38] <interop_madness> I know for a fact that https://targethost.contoso.com/somegivenpath works because it worked with the catch all regex
[17:53:06] <monr0e> ah, ok then. So you're able to access the reverse proxy after a fashion
[17:53:16] <interop_madness> yes
[17:53:51] <interop_madness> again, the initial paste.ee link worked nicely, except for one thing: the Location header of the target server's response must not be rewritten if host of Location header == target host
[17:54:04] <interop_madness> that's literally the only thing I need to fix
[17:54:27] <interop_madness> context for all of this bullshit is OpenId Connect authorization code flow btw ^^
[17:54:40] <monr0e> I take it you have access to the IIS console?
[17:54:54] <interop_madness> yes
[17:55:03] <interop_madness> local admin on the IIS's machine, everything
[17:58:22] <monr0e> If you have access to IIS, I'd just use the IIS gui to do this. You'll need application-request-routing and url-rewrite extensions to do it.
[17:59:04] <monr0e> the gui can handle the port too

[21:19:35] <sideup66> now i feel weird about it
[21:21:04] <PattyCakes> sideup66 but how much more money though?
[21:23:37] <sideup66> 35k more than i make now. but the tradeoff is, its not an upward job move. AND im full remote at the moment, with no solid plans of returning to office with alot of managers generally shying away from it at current job. new one wants me in 3 days a week and ultimately, id have to move closer to it
[21:24:00] <PattyCakes> oh yea, fuck that sideup66 
[21:24:01] <PattyCakes> good call
[21:24:30] <PattyCakes> I wouldn't put pants on for $35k let alone drive to an offiec
[21:25:29] <PattyCakes> My company came out with a "Remote First Philosophy"
[21:25:46] <sideup66> nono the job is alot more than just 35k/yr

[21:26:03] <bomb> 115k not bad at all
[21:26:06] <bomb> why did u rejekt?
[21:26:09] <PattyCakes> I don't wear pants now
[21:26:14] <PattyCakes> for another 35k I wouldn't
[21:26:34] <PublicWiFi> id wear a dildo on my head for 35k more
[21:26:43] <bomb> lol
[21:26:45] <sideup66> bomb: new job wants me in office 3 days a week on a hard line, id also have to move closer to the job too ultimately
[21:26:52] <PattyCakes> sideup66, I'm guessing some form of DevOps / SRE / Senior Ops role?
[21:26:54] <sideup66> if i had 1/2 days a week i could work it where i am
[21:27:00] <sideup66> real estate is a meme so good luck finding a place
[21:27:20] <bomb> sideup66 150 days for extra 35k. sounds like a good deal to me

[21:27:43] <bomb> working from home sucks tho

[21:29:18] <PattyCakes> shouldn't matter
[21:29:19] <sideup66> if current job sends us back its maybe 30 in the am traffic.
[21:29:23] <sd> 09<B​eef Snack Sticks> like, if you want to work in the office, thats your perogative, but im against forcing people back into the office
[21:29:24] <bomb> local MACCAS
[21:29:34] <sideup66> so id also have to move
[21:29:36] <sideup66> thats a PITA
[21:29:58] <bomb> employment is now called forcing people into offices?
[21:30:05] <PattyCakes> sideup66, our entire dev team basically said "if you force us back, you'll need to find new employees fast"
[21:30:08] <bomb> bad news: pandemic won't last forever
[21:30:16] <polar> moving is the real dealbreaker there, imo. three days a week in the office is doable for 115k
[21:30:25] <PattyCakes> bomb I will never work in an office again.

[21:31:59] <PublicWiFi> I'd have to build an office out back lol

[21:32:25] <bomb> you guys are in wrong mindset. you'll be back to the offices in a year
[21:32:26] <PattyCakes> because I think shakygator and I have some experience you might not have
[21:32:32] <PattyCakes> shakygator 2014 here
[21:32:39] <bomb> I'm just telling the truth
[21:32:43] <shakygator> LOL
[21:32:45] <PattyCakes> I was in an office briefly at RackSpace, but not long
[21:32:46] <shakygator> you dont know shit about shit
[21:32:49] <PattyCakes> ^
[21:32:57] <shakygator> i get 10 leads a week on full remote gigs
[21:33:13] <shakygator> covid made it even easier
[21:33:15] <bomb> why would companies pay you 6 figure when they can find remote workers from Europe?
[21:33:20] <shakygator> b/c they suck
[21:33:23] <bomb> I mean, we're not THAT important, are we?
[21:33:28] <shakygator> i am

[21:33:38] <bomb> you're not lol
[21:33:41] <shakygator> ok guy
[21:33:43] <sideup66> thats the thing
[21:33:47] <sideup66> this place is having a turnover problem
[21:33:56] <shakygator> of course anyone is replaceable, but i can be someones replacement too
[21:33:57] <bomb> you're not even software engoneers or something. who will also back to offices
[21:33:59] <sideup66> and basically chased me when i initially declined thinking something was up with the oncall schedule
[21:34:09] <shakygator> actually im a principal cloud engineer
[21:34:12] <PattyCakes> bomb have you not read what we're saying?

[21:34:18] <PattyCakes> I;ve been remote since 2014
[21:34:22] <PattyCakes> shakygator when did you go remote?
[21:34:22] <csws> bomb is right
[21:34:26] <shakygator> 2016
[21:34:34] <PattyCakes> shakygator, when did the pandemic start?
[21:34:38] <shakygator> 2020
[21:34:43] <csws> there's an entire middle management that needs to sit there and micromanage you in the office
[21:34:45] <PattyCakes> shakygator, what'st he math delta on that?
[21:34:52] <csws> and if people keep WFHing for a minute longer they might get sacked
[21:34:54] <shakygator> 420:69
[21:34:58] <PattyCakes> correct.
[21:35:02] <sideup66> see
[21:35:06] <shakygator> my managers are awesome, they dont gaf
[21:35:07] <sideup66> thats what my current company is doing basically
[21:35:09] <sideup66> re open office
[21:35:12] <shakygator> yes we have return to office, but not me :)
[21:35:13] <sideup66> people who want to go back can
[21:35:17] <sideup66> everyone else feel free to wfh
[21:35:17] <PattyCakes> yea, we;'re not shitting on you sideup66 
[21:35:22] <shakygator> cuz i dont have an office within 300 miles of here

[21:35:47] <shakygator> im about to get more like 70-90 for dif remote jerb
[21:35:52] <PattyCakes> and we all know estranger is out here not giving a fuck about ANYTHING
[21:35:53] <csws> can't believe my old company spent thousands of dollars furnishing a new floor in 2020 lol
[21:36:00] <csws> some companies are braindead
[21:36:18] <csws> but most normie companies really want asses in seats for some reason :(

[21:37:20] <shakygator> i asked for something here but it wont be 70k
[21:37:21] <bomb> we're not talking about your individual asses. as an industry, most people are going back to the offices once pandemic officially ends

[21:38:08] <sideup66> if anyone has a good recruiter or place to look
[21:38:11] <sideup66> im all for it
[21:38:12] <Hunterkll> SRE predates devops 
[21:38:13] <bomb> I'm a software engineer, I don't even need to be present remotely like poor peasant devops. I just git commit and call it a day
[21:38:16] <bomb> so stop bragging
[21:38:17] <shakygator> i get 10 leads a week sideup66 
[21:38:19] <shakygator> but what exp
[21:38:20] <Hunterkll> and a lot of SRE positions aren't devops related at all 
[21:38:40] <shakygator> SRE is a google infra thing
[21:38:45] <shakygator> that overflowed into the real world
[21:38:47] <sideup66> im gonna be starting out. im currently L2 ops support for my company. basically backend enviroment support for well, the whole US platform
[21:38:50] <PattyCakes> bomb ok? I don't look down on any role. I don't shit on my devs, or the SREs or my shakygator 
[21:38:55] <Hunterkll> some SRE positions don't even work with websites xD
[21:39:05] <PattyCakes> I'm glad you're a software engineer, it sounds like you make good money bomb 
[21:39:07] <shakygator> thats why we avoided SRE for our titles we just changed
[21:39:10] <sideup66> for dev stuff i know c#, little java, bash, powershell, have used github but dont know more of the advanced stuff

[21:42:13] <PattyCakes> again, the market is so hot at the moment
[21:42:16] <PattyCakes> I can dictate terms

[21:46:30] <Hunterkll> bomb: a lot of our employees have resumes that list fuckloads of 6 month jobs
[21:46:35] <Hunterkll> contract hopping, etc 
[21:46:51] <PattyCakes> I have 3 years of contracts on my resume, it's like 12 different companies 
[21:46:52] <PattyCakes> lol
[21:46:56] <Hunterkll> but that's gov't contracting life too, jumping from one company to another to work on a similar project after yours ends, etc
[21:46:57] <PattyCakes> contract hopping is normal
[21:47:02] <bomb> Hunterkll that does more harm than good. stability is important, sometimes you gotta suck it up and comply
[21:47:09] <PattyCakes> no
[21:47:11] <PattyCakes> you really don't

[21:47:23] <bomb> yeah, sure
[21:47:33] <Hunterkll> that is stability
[21:47:34] <PattyCakes> The company may not need ME personally, but in the same respect I don't NEED that company personally

[21:47:56] <Hunterkll> bomb: no, FTE employment

[21:48:13] <Hunterkll> 6mo-1yr at a contract before jumping to another one (as an employee of the company doing the contract work) is rather normal
[21:48:41] <PattyCakes> I'm confused. I thought we weren't talking about me personally bomb 
[21:48:50] <PattyCakes> do we all live in our mom's basement alone?
[21:49:00] <bomb> IDK you always talk about yourself
[21:49:02] <Hunterkll> you may be an FTE of company X, but once that contract ends, the entire team either finds new positions in the company(IE: different contract team that needs their skills), or goes to a new company for a different contract
[21:49:15] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: i think we all live in bomb's moms basement
[21:49:27] <PattyCakes> that explains the strange men in my bed Hunterkll 
[21:49:35] <bomb> your moms are busy or what
[21:49:47] <Hunterkll> bomb: I get hired on for a new team for a 1 year + 5 year option contract program at say, boeing 
[21:49:54] <Hunterkll> well, the government choses not to exercise the extended options
[21:50:05] <Hunterkll> so i've only worked there for a year, now i'm being let go, new job at another company, wash rinse and repeat
[21:50:19] <Hunterkll> (or stay in boeing and transfer to another contract)
[21:50:20] <DrZak> so you steal all the secrets, sell it to china and have a nice life bitching about immigrants
[21:50:25] <bomb> Hunterkll why are you telling all these to me?
[21:50:39] <Hunterkll> bomb: because you're the one who said that it's bad and isn't stability 
[21:50:43] <Hunterkll> when it's really the complete opposite
[21:50:47] <Hunterkll> normal and hella stability
[21:50:54] <bomb> I'm talking about a broader picture
[21:51:03] <Hunterkll> this is the broader picture for a few million people :D
[21:51:04] <PattyCakes> he's a big picture guy Hunterkll 
[21:51:04] <bomb> keep changin locations and shit doesn't appeal to me
[21:51:08] <bomb> if you're nomad, fine
[21:51:09] <PattyCakes> he's our manager basically Hunterkll 
[21:51:27] <Hunterkll> bomb: who said anything about moving around? You do this while buying your own house and living in the same area forever
[21:51:27] <DrZak> well, if they were mandated to tell you they arent extending anything 2 months before the end of the 1 year
[21:51:27] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:51:31] <bomb> ehh get a room and jerk each other
[21:51:38] <DrZak> its like the retarded side job i had last year
[21:51:41] <Hunterkll> DrZak: you know well in advance 
[21:51:45] <Hunterkll> if they're extending or not
[21:51:50] <DrZak> it ended end of december, nobody knew if i should work on january
[21:51:53] <Hunterkll> mainly because there's handoff procedures of the program to whoever the next prime is, etc 
[21:51:57] <PattyCakes> 6 months at least on most GSA contracts
[21:51:58] <DrZak> on january they otld me they arent extending
[21:52:14] <PattyCakes> now if YOUR contracting company tells you or not, that depends
[21:52:17] <Hunterkll> unless that contract is shutting down entirely, in which case you're involved in the shutdown process
[21:52:27] <PattyCakes> but most GSA contracts have 6 month notification periods about non extension
[21:52:35] <Hunterkll> or say, what happened to one of our contracts, someone else won prime on that contract 
[21:52:42] <Hunterkll> so we're now the subcontractors to that contractor
[21:52:45] <Hunterkll> still doing all the work :D
[21:53:09] <PattyCakes> though, I've never seen a 1 year GSA Hunterkll 
[21:53:16] <PattyCakes> those are like 3-5-10 years
[21:53:18] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: not everything is GSA.....
[21:53:21] <PattyCakes> fair
[21:53:23] <PattyCakes> totally fair
[21:53:23] <DrZak> this contracting business is insane
[21:53:32] <PattyCakes> I don't work in weapons or bombs
[21:53:35] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: DHHS, DHS, DoD, blah blah blah 
[21:53:38] <PattyCakes> I know
[21:53:39] <PattyCakes> I know
[21:53:48] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: the contract i'm talking about specifically is DHHS - that's healthcare - not weapons or bombs 
[21:53:49] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:54:12] <Hunterkll> specifically medicare/medcaid stuff :D (web development/backend web service stuff lol)
[21:54:15] <PattyCakes> well, I might be using the wrong terms than. GSA contracts are those that are stipulated pricing 
[21:54:38] <Hunterkll> GSA's a fulfillment agency and basically the office supplies group 
[21:54:41] *** Quits: ender (~ender1@2a01:260:4094:1:6045:6fff:fedd:cbf3) (Quit: Kroanar's blade sang! Not a catchy tune but it got stuck in a few peoples' heads	— Oglaf)
[21:54:41] <Hunterkll> also the taxi service
[21:54:46] <PattyCakes> IT falls under it
[21:54:49] <PattyCakes> well
[21:54:52] <PattyCakes> ugh
[21:55:00] <PattyCakes> you know what I mean, general services IT falls under it
[21:55:02] <Hunterkll> I mean, all our IT services contracts are with agencies directly so .... :D
[21:55:15] <Hunterkll> everything from One/NMCI to HHS's firewalls 
[21:55:22] <PattyCakes> if you're installing a new router in an IRS office
[21:55:24] <Hunterkll> well, HHS's firewalls is raytheon i think 
[21:55:30] <PattyCakes> it's written under GSA, and falls under their pricing structure
[21:55:30] <Hunterkll> or was it Harris?
[21:55:32] <Hunterkll> i forget
[21:56:22] <PattyCakes> now if you'll excuse me, my mom made me some pizza rolls for me and my friends. We're gonna go jack each other off as bomb suggested
[21:56:45] <Hunterkll> DLA handles a lot of DoD stuff, but the different branches handle their own directly too, NASA handles almost everything directly, etc... no GSA crud ;P
[21:57:00] <Hunterkll> hah
[21:57:13] <bomb> PattyCakes WOW that was clever
[21:57:52] <PattyCakes> I can't help the fact you're salty that you didn't get invited to the circle jerk
[21:58:09] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: but yea, sometimes contracts will specify a fixed time + option years, so that basically, if they're happy with the work, you keep on, if not, well.... recompete time ! 
[21:58:21] <Hunterkll> or if you've burned throug all option years, recompete again to keep the work 
[21:58:22] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:58:40] <Hunterkll> hence why you'll see 'obligated' 'current' and 'potential' award amounts for contracts
[21:58:49] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> well
[21:59:14] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> if i'm not burning 600W constantly this side of the apartment is cold
[21:59:15] <PattyCakes> ugh, we had to do an RFP at Rackspace for a alphabet agency  during the original creation of AWS gov-cloud
[21:59:30] <PattyCakes> that was a rough process
[21:59:31] <Hunterkll> that's a long time ago
[21:59:42] <Hunterkll> it makes me smile that microsoft beat AWS to the punch on classified general use cloud services
[21:59:43] <PattyCakes> 10 years at this point probably
[22:00:02] <Hunterkll> i nearly dropped my drink at an MS govcloud summit/event in DC that MS hosted when they broke that announcement 
[22:00:10] <Hunterkll> and it was one of those fancy expensive drinks too
[22:00:14] <PattyCakes> omg. Was that 2014?
[22:00:19] <PattyCakes> or 15?
[22:00:23] <PattyCakes> because I was fucking there
[22:00:31] <Hunterkll> lol!
[22:00:42] <Hunterkll> it was funny, our CEO snuck up behind me while i was visiting our table
[22:00:46] <PattyCakes> no, it was 2017 actually, but yes I was THERE
[22:00:51] <PattyCakes> RackSpace had a table
[22:00:54] <Hunterkll> i went to the last one, and the one before that
[22:00:58] *** Joins: Aoyagi (~yags@user/aoyagi)
[22:01:02] <Hunterkll> guy at our table was "OH HI LARRY!" 
[22:01:08] <Hunterkll> i was like oh fuck!
[22:01:38] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: we may have had the biggest central table ;P
[22:02:06] <PattyCakes> I mean, at the time Gov was our last play and this was pre-apollo acq
[22:02:07] <Hunterkll> i think that was the year we were giving out branded fidget spinners.....
[22:02:38] <PattyCakes> if I recall correctly, that was the same year Intel sunk a large chunk of cash into OpenStack
[22:02:40] <Hunterkll> shame MS isn't doing that anymore, the free open bars are always a nice touch 
[22:03:02] <PattyCakes> so our table might have been "Self-Hosted GovCloud on Azure"
[22:03:04] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: hah, was probably back when we acquired that other company .... and got ourselves into the cloud game 
[22:03:09] <PattyCakes> presented by OpenStack
[22:03:10] <PattyCakes> :P
[22:03:24] <Hunterkll> we bought out the only non-MS/AWS FedRAMP High cloud provider
[22:03:29] <Hunterkll> and they were full in on openstack etc 
[22:03:59] <PattyCakes> funny how two random idiots could have interacted years before they got onto a retard irc channel

[22:04:35] <Hunterkll> i guess we probably still own them
[22:04:57] <Hunterkll> they were like the first to get a fedramp ATO or something 
[22:04:59] <PattyCakes> I did the con circuit 2014-2017ish - if it was cloud based and on display, I probably took your card, your swag, and maybe shook your hand
[22:05:24] <Hunterkll> pff i never worked the tables
[22:05:30] <Hunterkll> i was always there to collect the free shit
[22:05:54] <PattyCakes> I was a roamer. I'd get called over to a booth if we had a legit buyer
[22:06:00] <Hunterkll> huh yup, we still have it 
[22:06:07] <Hunterkll> still competing head to head against AWS and Azure
[22:06:09] <PattyCakes> but mostly just roamed around, spied on companies, and drank free whiskey
[22:06:31] <Hunterkll> at one point we were going to use it for our internal services, but we also sell AWS and Azure to customers, so we use those instead :P

[22:10:12] <sideup66> id say either sre or software engineer
[22:10:12] <Hunterkll> HAHAHAHAHAHHAHHHAH
[22:10:13] <Hunterkll> https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/tt76c6/my_employer_was_sold_we_were_all_laid_off_and/
[22:10:16] <Hunterkll> BAHAHAHHAHAHA
[22:10:47] <shakygator> thats the problem, devops/architect/engineer can vary wildly depending on where you are
[22:10:55] <PattyCakes> ^
[22:10:57] <shakygator> for 4 years i lived in AWS, now i barely touch it except for my tooling
[22:11:21] <shakygator> which i dont like
[22:11:47] <shakygator> i hear we're gonna build some big anti fraud system in aws though so i got some stuff in the *not that kinda pipeline*
[22:12:05] <sideup66> UGH
[22:12:09] <sideup66> which is the RIGHT one then
[22:12:41] <shakygator> thats why you need exp in all of them, or understand the tech well enough to transition without much pain
[22:13:11] <sideup66> how do i get the exposure, what do i study/play with
[22:13:44] <shakygator> how much do you know about containers
[22:13:59] <shakygator> thats step 1 IMO
[22:14:15] <shakygator> and most places want kubernetes, or some form of it. Vanilla, EKS/AKS/OpenShift
[22:15:18] <shakygator> so you need to learn how to build containers, where you can store them (registries), and how to deploy them to k8s. then you start automating this with pipelines (on whatever cicd tool you have), and then you add more things like security scans, unit tests, blah blah
[22:15:26] <sideup66> thats what i was thinking of starting with
[22:15:30] <sideup66> kubernetes/k8s
[22:15:32] <DrZak> Chilli Con Reincarne
[22:15:33] <sideup66> and docker
[22:15:46] <shakygator> if you dont know anything about containers, yes, learn basic docker first
[22:15:54] <shakygator> i never used docker compose but there is some utility in knowing it too
[22:15:59] * bomb dickslaps PattyCakes 
[22:16:00] <sideup66> i can virtualize some stuff on my box with vbox
[22:16:08] <sideup66> and play in some vms
[22:16:21] <shakygator> just think of them as mini-vms, kinda
[22:16:24] *** Quits: mrghostman (~mrghostma@user/mrghostman) (Quit: leaving)
[22:16:37] <shakygator> but try to treat them as ephemeral. separate your compute and data layers
[22:17:04] <shakygator> IMO a container should never store data. its okay for lab stuff like pulling a db container for a backend of something else
[22:17:04] <sideup66> ight, i understood that concept
[22:17:11] <sideup66> i just never did it
[22:17:43] <shakygator> by that i specicially mean use a separate db, and if its file storage that volume should be on mapped to the container so it can be mapped to new containers, etc
[22:18:06] <shakygator> for example my sonarr/radarr have shared folders, map a volume for config to each. now i can pull new sonarr/radarr images and update them, data stays in tact
[22:18:10] <shakygator> makes it easy to backup too
[22:18:26] <sideup66> that makes sense
[22:18:33] <sideup66> because containers are built/destroyed constantly
[22:18:42] <sideup66> you dont ever play around with them independantly, you just deploy a new one
[22:18:47] <shakygator> yes, treat them as ephemeral. aka short-lived
[22:19:01] <shakygator> cattle vs pets
[22:19:15] <shakygator> its not an exchange server, we dont care why its not working, get a new one running and kill that one off
[22:19:17] <sideup66> right
[22:19:31] <sideup66> i understand that conceptually
[22:19:34] <sideup66> i just never built one
[22:20:16] <estranger> *a container should not store unique data. (fine for distributed systems imo)
[22:20:25] <sideup66> nah, period
[22:20:26] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> wait
[22:20:31] <estranger> disagree
[22:20:32] <sideup66> as shakygator said. never let the container hold stuff
[22:20:34] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> what do you use to build containers besides docker compose
[22:20:37] <estranger> it's still cattle
[22:20:42] <sideup66> store that on physical omewhere else. the containers can be blown up
[22:20:50] <shakygator> well they can store something
[22:20:50] <estranger> have an issue? shoot it
[22:20:51] <shakygator> they have to run
[22:21:02] <shakygator> but if its shared data, or meant to be long-lived data, dont store it locally
[22:21:03] <estranger> new pod will replicate back what it needs
[22:21:18] <shakygator> and if youre processing a lot of data it should be in a messaging/queue system anyways
[22:21:22] <estranger> if it's a distributed system it's designed to fail
[22:21:50] <estranger> shakygator what if your distributed streaming platform is in containers? 
[22:22:07] <shakygator> then that data is store not-in-a-container
[22:22:21] <shakygator> should be block storage behind it somewhere
[22:22:57] <sideup66> where should i start? can i start with a vm and install docker on it (say use linux, ubuntu or debian)
[22:23:02] <estranger> so by your definition a stateful set is not data on a container? that I can live with
[22:23:33] <estranger> sounded like you were staying any stateful work load doesn't belong in a container
[22:24:08] <shakygator> im just saying dont put data on a container you expect to access later, or expect a container to be termed at any moment
[22:24:16] *** bn_work is now known as b
[22:24:32] <Hunterkll> basically expect netflix's chaos monkey to rampage your shit
[22:24:35] <shakygator> you see a lot of demos, or apps that say, oh just run this mysql container as your data source
[22:24:46] *** b is now known as Guest9323
[22:24:49] <shakygator> which can be fine, assuming you gave some thought to where that data is actually stored and what happens if that container goes away
[22:25:07] <estranger> it's ok if your data is terminated if it's a distributed system though
[22:25:14] *** Guest9323 is now known as bn_work
[22:25:15] <sideup66> either way
[22:25:20] <sideup66> where the f do i start
[22:25:30] <shakygator> go do a docker hello world
[22:25:40] <shakygator> understand how to run a container, and where that container comes from (docker hub)
[22:25:57] <shakygator> and then learn you how to make custom images, and how to put those in a registry and then run those
[22:26:16] <shakygator> maybe learn how to run it in AWS ECS too
[22:26:29] <shakygator> assuming there is a free tier
[22:26:29] <estranger> same reason raid0 is ok
[22:26:39] <Hunterkll> I mean, not quite the same model, but I have three synchronous replicas and 4 more fallback async replicas that will upgrade to sync if a sync disappears for a specific databse workload
[22:26:44] <Hunterkll> doesn't bother me if a VM host or cloud region dies 
[22:26:52] <shakygator> if your data is replicated elsewhere estranger then "youve given though to where that data is actually stored"
[22:27:41] <estranger> it's a big reason to switch to distributed systems... you care about your data heh
[22:27:51] <estranger> SPOFs suck
[22:28:03] <PattyCakes> so do HOAs
[22:28:04] <Hunterkll> yea
[22:28:13] <Hunterkll> but sometimes, even distributed systems can fail
[22:28:35] <Hunterkll> russia saw that a single front invasion would be doomed - or exceedingly difficult, so they implemented a distributed system, and it's still not able to keep up with the load 
[22:28:39] <PattyCakes> that's one nice part about offloading to "the cloud" Hunterkll 
[22:28:42] <estranger> well you design for how much tolerance for failure you have
[22:28:46] <PattyCakes> if my shit is down? the rest of the internet is too
[22:29:11] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: the cost isn't, i'm marking the days till we start re-utilizng our internal DC footprints again 
[22:29:12] <Hunterkll> ;)
[22:29:23] <estranger> at both a local and regional level
[22:29:43] <PattyCakes> I could see server rooms being reintroduced onsite
[22:30:08] <PattyCakes> but companies either colo'ing entire datahalls or building their own DC? Those days are over
[22:30:20] <PattyCakes> s/but/but most
[22:30:20] <layer8> PattyCakes meant: "but most companies either colo'ing entire datahalls or building their own DC? Those days are over"
[22:30:41] <Hunterkll> hah
[22:30:45] <PattyCakes> sure, there's always an edge case that cloud doesn't make sense for
[22:30:48] <Hunterkll> as we're building out datacenters for customers 
[22:30:48] <estranger> yeh the flexibility and speed to market business value has to be greater then your higher top line costs of the cloud
[22:30:57] <PattyCakes> but the MAJORITY of internet connected apps will be running on the cloud
[22:31:00] <PattyCakes> that's a simple fact
[22:31:10] <Hunterkll> it's a boom/bust cycle
[22:31:24] *** Joins: vinrock (~vinrock@user/vinrock)
[22:31:32] <estranger> we're seeing a huge migration too, will see what 5 years brings heh
[22:31:52] <Hunterkll> Mainframes -> Minicomputers -> Mainframes -> PCs -> Mainframes -> PCs -> Mainframes -> Commodity Server racks -> Cloud -> Datacenter expansion again -> Cloud -> ?
[22:32:05] <Hunterkll> the pendulum swings back and forth every 5-10 years
[22:32:15] <estranger> Borg 
[22:32:18] <PattyCakes> I always see a place for onprem local storage
[22:32:26] <PattyCakes> and onprem local directory
[22:32:42] <PattyCakes> especially if your business isn't external but more internal
[22:32:46] <estranger> physics are a bitch
[22:32:49] <PattyCakes> think accounting firms with large quickbooks files
[22:33:04] <Hunterkll> get me a cloud with as much uptime as our properly working shit that cost half the price and i'll get you a unicorn AND a pink dragon 
[22:33:08] <PattyCakes> those are mostly running an on-prem business, their use case doesn't REALLY justify the cloud
[22:33:37] <Hunterkll> there's a reason C-level email is in our onprem exchange still and rank and file isn't ;)
[22:33:48] <estranger> "hybrid cloud" "multi cloud" 
[22:33:51] <Hunterkll> well, c-level, sales, contract admin folks, etc
[22:33:52] <PattyCakes> but the person that's building their own version of quickbooks, or is already running their own version of quickbooks
[22:33:57] <PattyCakes> well that person should be on the cloud
[22:33:59] <PattyCakes> not onprem
[22:34:02] <PattyCakes> because they sell a product
[22:34:04] <PattyCakes> not consume a product
[22:35:06] <PattyCakes> huh, I kinda just spewed those words out but that's honestly a great way to differentiate Cloud vs On-Prem. "Are you the provider or the consumer"
[22:35:13] <Hunterkll> eh
[22:35:16] <Hunterkll> cost comes into play too
[22:35:26] <Hunterkll> "huh, i could save an hour or two a month for.... 5x the cost? no thanks"
[22:35:41] <Hunterkll> bbut a lot of people are lured in (right now) by the reduction in duties/workload/etc till they get bit by the bill 
[22:35:45] <Hunterkll> and then they're often stuck, held captive
[22:35:52] <PattyCakes> no way can you provide a mutinational application in your own DCs for cheaper than the OpEX of AWS
[22:36:01] <Hunterkll> ..... but we do? :P
[22:36:14] <PattyCakes> well there's also the fact that on prem is CapEx
[22:36:19] <PattyCakes> and AWS is OpEx
[22:36:35] <Hunterkll> then again, we also sell our own multi-region cloud platform too....
[22:36:39] <PattyCakes> fair
[22:36:44] <Hunterkll> but we don't use it ourselves
[22:36:45] <Hunterkll> lol
[22:36:56] <PattyCakes> you've already put int the capital, if you sink it yourself, and don't run the fucker
[22:36:58] <PattyCakes> you're McDonalds
[22:37:02] <PattyCakes> you ownt he land, and the building
[22:37:02] <Hunterkll> no no
[22:37:07] <PattyCakes> some other stupid motherfucker runs the operations
[22:37:10] <Hunterkll> the cloud platform and its datacenters
[22:37:11] <Hunterkll> we don't actually use
[22:37:14] <Hunterkll> lol
[22:37:23] <Hunterkll> the stuff we build and sell is in our internal datacenters 
[22:37:27] <Hunterkll> that isn't the cloud platform
[22:37:32] <Hunterkll> we do both 
[22:37:32] <Hunterkll> haha
[22:37:35] <PattyCakes> oh, so you're half McDonalds
[22:37:38] <PattyCakes> and have NNN leases
[22:37:39] <PattyCakes> :P
[22:37:42] <Hunterkll> one of our exchange environments supports ~400k users 
[22:37:49] <Hunterkll> better uptime than O365 and gapps 
[22:37:50] <Hunterkll> :D
[22:38:03] <PattyCakes> Walmart Labs enterprise openstack setup laughs at your 400k users
[22:38:17] <Hunterkll> yea, but we're talking exchange here
[22:38:22] <PattyCakes> I am too
[22:38:38] <PattyCakes> They run Exchange on OpenStack compute instances
[22:38:42] <PattyCakes> well they did
[22:38:48] <Hunterkll> that's.... ridiculous 
[22:38:52] <PattyCakes> hehehe
[22:38:53] <PattyCakes> I know
[22:38:58] <Hunterkll> ours is actually built properly, non-RAID physical disks on physical bare metal installs
[22:39:20] <Hunterkll> multiple datacenters with redundant connections and all that jazz, multiple geographic regions, shittons of data copies everywhere, etc
[22:39:34] <PattyCakes> well, as of 2020 when I left, they were moving from OpenStack on-prem to hosted open stack
[22:40:09] <Hunterkll> .... that's probably why our exchange environments are the most responsive and actually plesant to use ones i've encountered, come to think of it.... we actually built and deploy the applications as they're designed to be used
[22:40:23] <Hunterkll> not shoehorn them into a different environment and disregard the virtualization implications 
[22:40:33] <estranger> holy shit, you guys read the manuals? 
[22:40:52] <Hunterkll> small or large things like you know, virtual exchange? make sure disk caching is turned off across the entire disk/data path, etc 
[22:40:57] <Hunterkll> don't give it too much ram
[22:41:00] <Hunterkll> don't give it too many CPU cores
[22:41:04] <Hunterkll> but don't give it too few either
[22:41:05] <Hunterkll> etc
[22:41:24] <Hunterkll> always makes me laugh when people try and fix exchange issues by throwing more ram at it and watch the performance tank 
[22:41:38] <PattyCakes> My favorite part about our env Hunterkll? We provision EKS nodes based on pricing alone and continuously and dynamically delete and replace nodes in our cluster because pricing dropped
[22:41:48] <Hunterkll> hah
[22:41:50] <Hunterkll> that's pretty nice
[22:42:10] <PattyCakes> we ran reports on the cost savings, we funded 2 additioanl head counts from those savings.
[22:42:23] <Hunterkll> we're more of a contract reserved instances type deal for most stuff
[22:42:32] <PattyCakes> we have our reserved nodes, don't get me wrongf
[22:42:43] <PattyCakes> but our worker nodes, those are dynamic
[22:43:31] <Hunterkll> yea
[22:43:37] <Hunterkll> i helped set up a scale up/scale down sharepoint system once
[22:43:39] <Hunterkll> that was fun to automate
[22:43:57] <Hunterkll> our sharepoint lights up like a christmas tree before business hours, and winds down to like just 2 server farm at night 
[22:44:22] <Hunterkll> i whipped sharepoint into cooperating with the cloud model for cost savings :P
[22:44:42] <PattyCakes> we BEGGED our culture team to please send us ahead of time the links to the sharepoint pages they were going to email out
[22:44:53] <PattyCakes> they never did
[22:45:02] <PattyCakes> sharepoint crashed every email blast

[23:15:55] <Hunterkll> i mean, i guess for patching or just inventory data it's okay
[23:16:25] <Hunterkll> but defender ATP for AV, and GPO for the rest of the configuration

[23:23:22] <Hunterkll> I'm aware they have the basic ADMX for a few things imported already, but even then, they only have Office 2016 ADMX imported in templates for example
[23:23:49] <Hunterkll> I use intune extensively at home with SCCM co-management and have moved as much as i could over to it :D 
[23:24:09] <Hunterkll> my entire home network is hybrid AAD joined :D 
[23:25:15] <Hunterkll> sadly, outside of OMA-URI and templates, it's really hard without just laying down custom registry splatter to work on a lot of stuff 
[23:25:15] <JollyRgrs> @Scruffy if at first you don't succeed. try it without the filter and see what it is called (hint: "cmd" and not "cmd.exe")
[23:25:23] <JollyRgrs> you are looking at process name, not process file name
[23:25:31] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Hey, more power to you. I'm just saying I don't see the value in the additional complexity of Intune + AD + SCCM for my org. If I had more than 9 months of actually acting like a sysadmin, maybe I'd feel differently. But Intune appears perfectly adequate for our org right now and as the IT org matures, i'm sure it'll continue to branch out more
[23:25:43] <Hunterkll> oh, i'm not saying you're wrong to do that!
[23:25:58] <JollyRgrs> smaller or less complex needs, intune would be fine
[23:25:59] <Hunterkll> like i said before - if you fit, it's a great option 
[23:26:13] <Hunterkll> it's once you have to break outside of any of those walls that you'll be engineering some really janky shit 
[23:26:35] <JollyRgrs> this is why i laugh every time someone tries to say "let's go full AAD and intune" at my company
[23:26:53] <Hunterkll> but if you don't hit those edge cases, then it's relatively smooth sailing
[23:27:12] <Hunterkll> intune by nature of using the MDM APIs in windows instead of being a full on slap you in the ass system gets a bit quirky sometimes 
[23:27:37] <Hunterkll> lol ooops
[23:27:39] <JollyRgrs> most "startups" and younger companies would have a much easier time starting with intune... and once established, you would simply say "we can't do that with intune" and they'd probably look for a different way of doing things

[23:29:14] <Hunterkll> fucking asus motherboard
[23:29:18] <Hunterkll> i really should set those BIOS attributes
[23:29:24] <Hunterkll> serial number 1 and device model "FUCK YOU"
[23:29:28] <bomb> I'd get a CBL license (costs like ten grands), a truck ($30-35k), and enjoy making $10k a week
[23:29:41] <Hunterkll> CBL? You mean CDL?
[23:29:51] <bomb> CDL

[23:30:18] <Hunterkll> i'm just gonna pretend a CBL is a cannabis bus license
[23:30:23] <Hunterkll> and you should definitely get that
[23:30:42] <bomb> CDL is Cannabis Delivery License
[23:30:56] <Hunterkll> yea but
[23:31:00] <Hunterkll> with a CBL you can roll a party bus 
[23:31:06] <Hunterkll> and everyone can smoke up in it 
[23:31:40] <bomb> who'd party with bunch of stoners?
[23:31:48] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> well
[23:31:53] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that's why you need your CCL
[23:31:56] <DrGibbysWifi> PublicWiFi: I'm around but working man. First day at the new gig 
[23:31:59] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> cocaine consumer license
[23:32:00] <bomb> CCL?
[23:32:18] <bomb> less paper work needed than weed license :P
[23:32:38] <Hunterkll> alrighty
[23:32:41] <Hunterkll> looks like SSRS is working now
[23:34:00] <sd> 09<S​cruffy> It appears as though you were right. I was looking at the process name from Task Manager, and it shows up there as 'cmd.exe'. Thought I was going crazy
[23:34:41] <fritzwastaken> Hope you are kickin ass DrGibbysWifi!
[23:34:54] <fritzwastaken> Also who starts on a Friday?
[23:34:55] <PublicWiFi> DrGibbysWifi: crush it!
[23:35:09] <DrGibbysWifi> Drinking from a firehouse 
[23:35:21] <DrGibbysWifi> Err
[23:35:23] <DrGibbysWifi> Firehose
[23:35:26] <fritzwastaken> lol
[23:35:55] <sd> 09<S​cruffy> Thanks @JollyRgrs
[23:36:09] <Hunterkll> drinking from a firehose?
[23:36:14] <Hunterkll> they got you on your knees that fast
[23:36:14] <Hunterkll> damn
[23:40:16] <sd> 14<K​illnine> SSRS is something I dont miss
[23:41:00] <Hunterkll> bloody useful it is though
[23:41:04] *** Quits: nullrend (~nullrend@user/nullrend) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[23:41:11] <Hunterkll> but in this case, i was upgrading versions alongside SQL itself
[23:41:18] <Hunterkll> you never see it though since it's all accessed via the SCCM console
[23:42:17] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Yeah it can do some nice stuff. We used it on the dev side to make nice PDF printouts for stuff like bills of lading and customer-specific templates for drop shipping. But it could be very finnicky. Mostly the APIs for integrating with it than the actual platform itself
[23:42:18] <Hunterkll> I do occasionally grant access directly to the SSRS web interface though, for people who need some of the reports but don't need any SCCM access at all
[23:45:11] <Hunterkll> heh
[23:45:15] <Hunterkll> speaking of integrations
[23:45:24] <Hunterkll> i forgot to reapply the assemblies used for SCCM report generation
[23:45:24] <Hunterkll> :D
[23:45:51] <sd> 14<K​illnine> I remember it being very specific about dlls used for generating reports
[23:46:28] <sd> 14<K​illnine> One of those things where you did it once a year and the next time it acted up you'd forgotten what you needed to do to fix. And someone already decomm'd the teamsite you documented it on 😄
[23:48:34] <misspwn> man this microsoft NCE shit is causing so much drama
[23:48:44] <misspwn> hope all you upgraded or whatever before the cutoff
[23:50:30] <Hunterkll> Hm?
[23:50:48] <misspwn> microsoft 0365 licenses that had to be upgraded to NCE
[23:51:19] *** Joins: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy)
