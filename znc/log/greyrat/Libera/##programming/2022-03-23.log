[00:00:02] <apotheon> or Smalltalk
[00:00:11] <piou> Numocha: so... I'd say don't try choosing your second language right now :p
[00:00:13] <apotheon> I could swear it used to be spelled with a capital T.
[00:00:16] <kee> Smalltalk is tricky to get a programming environment for.
[00:00:47] <oldlaptop> "just checked Python's" (which I'm not sure I buy, but accepting it for the sake of argument) is a pretty major categorical difference, I think
[00:00:49] <Raziel> look at this guy wanting to have two languages :^)
[00:01:02] <kee> oldlaptop: It's only partly checked, though.
[00:01:03] <nomagno> If C99 preprocessor is turing-complete, can you make a compiler from LangC to portable C99 using only the C99 preprocessor!?
[00:01:14] <kee> There's an attempt, like C, to check it, but actually the language doesn't care.
[00:01:24] <apotheon> As long as we're discussing languages to learn for the sake of broadening the programmer, let's throw in SML and Prolog.

[00:01:30] <oldlaptop> That Java's type system (and python's for that matter) is icky I have *no* disagreement with whatsoever.
[00:01:42] <novns> nomagno, if something is turing-complete you can do anything
[00:01:47] <kee> Python's is okay.
[00:01:50] <oldlaptop> (I think you should be either haskell or tcl - either the type system is powerful and useful, or it's in the way and should not bleeding well exist)
[00:01:51] <novns> but it would be hard
[00:02:20] <nomagno> novns: Just imagine compiling Haskell to C using CPP.
[00:02:24] <kee> I disagree with how Haskell thinks about types. But if you want to broaden your understanding, sure, Haskell is good.

[00:03:36] <oldlaptop> It should be useful as a tool for proving important properties of the program, or it is in the way and shouldn't exist.

[00:04:13] <kee> The Rust Programming Language and Learn You A Haskell For Great Good are considered good introductions, I think? (Correct me if I'm wrong.)
[00:04:18] <apotheon> Numocha: It's definitely a good idea to stick with a language long enough to get reasonably familiar with programming itself.
[00:04:19] <Numocha> kee: It's just I might feel bad about myself for not even being good at something and already wanting to try out another thing
[00:04:24] <kee> Numocha: You're learning to program.
[00:04:26] <oldlaptop> Learn You A Haskell is great good.
[00:04:29] <kee> You're not learning Ruby.
[00:04:39] <apotheon> 19:32 < kee> Learn a new language and you will be better at Ruby when you come back to it.
[00:05:00] <apotheon> That has limitations.  If you start with a language, then switch languages two weeks in, you're almost certainly wasting time.
[00:05:05] <Raziel> I learned programming once. It was terrible.
[00:05:05] <oldlaptop> Tcl's official tutorial is arguably best experienced in its original form: http://www.msen.com/~clif/TclTutor.html
[00:05:08] <novns> apotheon, "and you will be better at avoiding Ruby"
[00:05:52] <novns> Ruby is a nice language but programs eats all your memory
[00:05:58] <novns> *eat
[00:06:00] <apotheon> LYAHFGG is kinda crappy, in my experience, by the way.
[00:06:15] <Numocha> novns: It is heavy?
[00:06:19] <oldlaptop> (the tutorial link you'd follow at tcl.tk points to a text that essentially derives from that, but is somewhat more up to date - I'd say you can learn coroutines and {*} once you have at least somewhat grokked the language)
[00:06:24] <apotheon> It pretends to be written for newbies, but it reads like it was written *by* newbies.
[00:06:32] <oldlaptop> apotheon: Hm. Perhaps mileage varies?
[00:06:41] <novns> Numocha, running gitlab requires 1TB of memory at least
[00:06:45] <oldlaptop> I don't remember getting the impression its authors didn't know what they were talking about.
[00:06:49] <nomagno> LYAHFGG is grrrrreat?
[00:06:57] <kee> apotheon: I can pick up a new language, enough to start learning from the language design, in 30 minutes to a day. I think two weeks is plenty of time for most purposes. (But maybe I've forgotten what it's like at the beginning.)
[00:06:57] <apotheon> novns: "it depends" (re: memory)

[00:07:36] <oldlaptop> (ah, and tcltutor does know about {*} anyway!)
[00:07:39] <apotheon> That's the same with every language . . . except you have to learn a language while learning programming.
[00:07:45] <novns> apotheon, whatever amount of memory you have - it will never be enough for running a gitlab instance
[00:07:53] <kee> apotheon: Ruby has opinions about certain things.
[00:07:57] <oldlaptop> apotheon: There really is no way around that, is there?

[00:08:01] <apotheon> . . . and if you keep switching languages, you keep wasting time on learning enough of the new language to catch up to where you already were.
[00:08:01] <kee> If you want to learn programming, you need a second opinion.
[00:08:09] <oldlaptop> The "best" you can do is learn a useless language in which you can't actually program.
[00:08:12] *** Joins: morte_ (~user@190.104.116.153)
[00:08:33] <apotheon> It's best to learn enough programming in one language to make it easier to learn other languages and immediately be able to write real programs before you start skipping around, if you want to be any good.
[00:08:33] <Raziel> the best you can do is learn C++ and ruin your life forever
[00:08:39] <novns> you need to learn paradigms, not languages
[00:08:49] <oldlaptop> Raziel: Misery sure does love company, don't it?
[00:08:54] <kee> novns: You need to learn the concepts of paradigms, not paradigms.
[00:08:55] <Raziel> oldlaptop, indeed
[00:09:08] <Numocha> Then it looks like I need to learn the programming mindset and important concepts
[00:09:13] <apotheon> Otherwise, you can get stuck in the rut of learning the same three months' worth of programming over and over.
[00:09:14] <oldlaptop> Numocha: Indeed.
[00:09:15] <Numocha> Do you have any book recommendations?
[00:09:21] <kee> Numocha: Learn C. It's a language you'll never use in practice. :-)
[00:09:33] <novns> kee, it does not interfere
[00:09:42] <oldlaptop> (Probably learn C after you've learned programming, though.)
[00:09:48] <kee> novns: True. So long as you don't stick rigorously to the paradigm afterwards.
[00:09:51] <oldlaptop> (From K&R2 if possible.)
[00:09:55] <apotheon> kee: That's blatantly untrue, for a generic definition of "you" (re: C).
[00:09:56] <Raziel> learn C++ but force yourself to only use the data-driven paradigm
[00:09:59] <kee> oldlaptop: What about C makes it a bad language to learn originally.
[00:10:06] <Raziel> you'll either give up within a day or come out a better (but highly insane) programmer
[00:10:14] <pyzozord> Numocha: I think a good way to do that is to learn through learning differnet languages and taclking different problems in those languages
[00:10:15] <novns> kee, you need to know that there are many different tools suitable for different tasks
[00:10:22] <novns> kee, and you can choose a tool for a task
[00:10:24] <oldlaptop> Undefined behavior, and its implications for the common learning strategy of trial-and-error.
[00:10:31] <kee> apotheon: Sometimes you have to use C, yeah – I use it quite a bit. But that's only out of necessity.
[00:10:34] <pyzozord> Numocha: I think it doesn't really matter where you start, matters more /that/ you start
[00:10:42] <nomagno> ^
[00:10:45] <novns> kee, and you can create your own DSL for a task, because why not
[00:10:45] <kee> oldlaptop: In which case, shouldn't a language with good compiler errors be preferred?
[00:10:50] <apotheon> I use C because I like it, and it suits a number of programming needs.
[00:11:06] <kee> novns: This is true. But a paradigm is not a tool: it's a collection of tools with an ideology behind it.
[00:11:12] <nomagno> Writing UB-free C (at least free of the bad kind of UB) is mentally tolling
[00:11:15] <sonny6> book faq is probably a good idea
[00:11:15] <oldlaptop> A language in which doing something unambiguously wrong unambiguously produces an error at *some* point is good.
[00:11:28] <novns> kee, it's a general idea
[00:11:40] <piou> starting with a language that helps you achieve real things can help a lot with keeping your motivation up, but starting anywhere is the most important
[00:11:50] <sonny6> Numocha this looks good https://eloquentjavascript.net/
[00:11:50] <oldlaptop> C need not give you that, and real implementations will pretty much universally teach you things that are wrong if you try to learn with trial-and-error.
[00:11:51] <bayaz> Title: Eloquent JavaScript 
[00:11:53] <novns> you need to know it to be able to choose
[00:12:03] <kee> oldlaptop: So: Python, Rust, Haskell, FORTH, Tk, Ruby, JavaScript, Objective C (?), Scratch.
[00:12:04] <pyzozord> Numocha: python is a safe choice, it's easy to start with, it's deep, it's got a great and knoweledgable community, it's versitile and it makes you employable
[00:12:20] <apotheon> Numocha: If you genuinely think the specific language you're using is getting in your way, you may want to change languages, but chances are good that if you're not using something pathological (e.g. COBOL or PHP) or unsuited to your learning style as a first language (perhaps C) you're probably good to just stick with the language you started using first until you're really programming.
[00:12:25] <kee> But not C, C++, Bash, PHP.
[00:12:28] <sonny6> I like programming books from the 70s and 80s, I dunno what is a good text today
[00:12:28] <oldlaptop> objc is a superset of C and has all the same UB baggage
[00:12:39] <oldlaptop> (as does C++, even though it's not a clean superset)
[00:12:59] <Numocha> apotheon: I don't think it's getting in my way. I do enjoy it and want to learn more about what I can do with it
[00:13:04] <kee> What's that language that's the successor to Objective C? I heard that one was good.
[00:13:09] <Raziel> tfw C++ thrown in with PHP
[00:13:13] <nomagno> It's really a puzzle writing my game with a constraint of not using more than 16-bit unsigned integers
[00:13:17] <sonny6> as for learning a specific language, you will likely pick something that is easy to access
[00:13:19] <Raziel> I am personally offended
[00:13:27] <oldlaptop> Swift?
[00:13:30] <apotheon> sonny6: Eloquent JavaScript is a good book, but it's not exactly a good first-teaching book.
[00:13:30] <novns> kee, swift, but no one uses it outside the apple world
[00:13:34] <kee> Raziel: Sorry. You're a PHP programmer?
[00:13:48] <kee> PHP does have its uses.
[00:13:52] <sonny6> apotheon so the person has none or little experience?
[00:14:12] <Raziel> kee, I'd reply but I'm too busy looking up where the closest burn center is
[00:14:28] <Raziel> :^)
[00:14:35] <Numocha> I do want to learn a language that can help me get into software development and write cool programs. Yeah that sounds too general...
[00:14:37] <sonny6> That text seems good if you have little experience, if you have no exposure than I am not sure

[00:18:16] <Raziel> why is it that when someone says they use linux no one tells them to try windows, but when someone says they use windows they immediately get shat on? v:
[00:18:24] <apotheon> holy shit, the pythonistas are insistent today
[00:18:42] <sonny6> apotheon it's really more about material being available
[00:18:42] <oldlaptop> I don't like python. I think it's a perfectly reasonable choice as a first language.
[00:18:56] <novns> Raziel, because you can not trust windows and ms
[00:18:57] <apotheon> The best Python books I've seen are mostly about a 6 out of 10, in my experience.
[00:19:06] <pyzozord> Numocha: more then that, if you read the full book it has some advanced algorithms it's really a book from zero to hero
[00:19:13] <apotheon> The amount of material isn't as important as the quality of material you choose.
[00:19:23] <sonny6> Java is simplier imo, and there's a lot of material for Java, but I don't think it will be as good
[00:19:28] <oldlaptop> Dive Into Python (3) is IMO excellent, but alas is not a beginner book.
[00:19:34] <apotheon> Python is a reasonable choice as first language, depending on the individual and the learning resources.

[00:20:48] <novns> the last good windows version was 7
[00:20:59] <pyzozord> lots in it I don't know, including statistics, probability, machine learning...
[00:21:09] <apotheon> sonny6: That's actually difficult to answer.  I've heard good things about Chris Pine's book, Learn To Program, for complete novices.
[00:21:15] <Raziel> novns, ehhhh sure, for a normal user that isn't capable of getting rid of that crap, it's quite cancerous
[00:21:24] <flaqoniun> 7 was decent, but also the start of constant-neverending-wave-of-updates
[00:21:32] <Raziel> but a user who's incapable of getting rid of ads in windows definitely can't use linux proficiently either
[00:21:44] <apotheon> Part of the problem is that mostly people recommending things didn't start with a recent-ish complete-beginner book, so we don't know what to recommend.

[00:22:10] <WeeBey> that we are in the future. :-)

[00:26:25] <novns> php is a nice tool for its tasks
[00:26:27] <duckgoose> GOTO is just a jump. there's nothing wrong with jumps

[00:26:31] <apotheon> Numocha: It seems like a strange statement.

[00:27:55] <bayaz> Title: How to Design Programs 
[00:27:56] <apotheon> In Ruby, I actually find that the instances where one would use case statements in other languages are often replaced by simple use of a hash in Ruby, or some other construct that doesn't explicitly deal with conditionals.
[00:27:57] <Numocha> "Prefer case over if-elsif when compared value is the same in each clause."

[00:28:28] <duckgoose> I have you know your code compiles to simple machine code that includes jumps 
[00:28:33] <duckgoose> so you use them, weather willing or not
[00:28:38] <Raziel> apotheon, oh don't worry, I use hash maps instead of switch case in C++ often enough too :p
[00:28:39] <pyzozord> Another interesting book I am planning to read is Structured Programming
[00:28:44] <apotheon> Numocha: That can be a thing, sometimes.
[00:28:48] <sonny6> lol why
[00:28:57] <sonny6> structured programming is so outdated
[00:29:04] <oldlaptop> duckgoose: Of course you do. Whether it's wise to teach people programming by using explicit, raw jumps is a different question.
[00:29:15] <apotheon> Numocha: It depends.  I'm a little surprised Larn to Program didn't mention case statements, but it's not a big deal when just getting started.
[00:29:21] <duckgoose> so the issue isn't jumps
[00:29:27] <duckgoose> it's how they're used!
[00:29:42] <flaqoniun> i use gotos for prototyping (sometimes) but always remove them later, only valid use IMO is for error handling (jump to end of function)
[00:29:47] <apotheon> Numocha: The if/else option is more general, and the case option is more specific, so you can do what you need with if/else, but sometimes can't do the same things with case.
[00:29:52] <oldlaptop> The common "goto is evil" meme is wrong, but it's usefully wrong. The people who believe it are the people who should act on it, and the people who know better *know better*.

[01:23:18] <JanC> what's a "morse keyboard"?
[01:23:35] <edgar-rft> a one-key keyboard :-)
[01:24:18] <nomagno> I honestly don't like devices that need a time element to function
[01:24:21] <JanC> you could translate that to USB-HID, USB-serial, USB-audio, ...
[01:24:38] <nomagno> Two buttons is bare minimum imo
[01:24:44] <nomagno> One for coding and a other for separating
[01:25:16] <edgar-rft> one key + a board = keyboard
[01:25:20] <JanC> I assume they mean USB-HID so that it looks like a "regular" USB keyboard?
[01:25:48] <nomagno> So 'M1' means 'beep', 'M2 M1' means 'next letter', and 'M2 M2' means 'next word'
[01:26:18] <nomagno> Possibly with three-key sequences staring with M2 for a great total of as many symbols as you want and 4 different separators
[01:27:30] <nomagno> I propose 'next letter', 'space', 'newline', and 'please disable this dumb driver' as special actions :)
[01:27:44] <edgar-rft> JanC: the tricky part is the driver tranlating the click-sequences and behaving like a normal keyboard to the rest of the computer
[01:29:07] <JanC> edgar-rft: but does that driver run on the keyboard (which would be needed to create a USB HID device) or in the host computer?

[01:33:17] <pyzozord> it's so frustrating, requires really a lot of effort and focus from me to read even stupid sentences like this
[01:33:30] <nomagno> pyzozord: Example: 'bool mybool = 1 + 1'
[01:33:45] <nomagno> This overflows because a boolean is one bit and 1 + 1 = 2, which requires 2 bits

[04:05:47] <apotheon> c7s: I wonder how many people who say that have really used BSD Unix much.
[04:05:49] <duuude> c7s: probably lacks systemd, has a very simple package manager etc.
[04:06:14] <duuude> if it also lacks linux drivers that is an ultra-bonus
[04:06:37] <apotheon> In the case of Slackware and Alpine, if they mean it positively they probably mean it's not loaded down with as much shit as something like Fedora or Ubuntu, and if negatively they probably mean it's not weighted down with as much shit as something like Fedora or Ubuntu.
[04:06:50] <c7s> makes sense, though it kind of confirms my susipicion that it's a useless thing to say
[04:06:51] <sonny> I should do linux from scratch

[04:07:29] <sonny> my kernels will be vanilla but w/e

[04:36:33] <oldlaptop> in practice, getting all its users to use some completely different format would be rather difficult, which would explain why nobody seems to have substantively touched "SQLightning" in nearly a decade: https://github.com/LMDB/sqlightning

[04:37:07] <oldlaptop> (another reason would be that sqlite moves pretty fast; a complete replacement of the backend could be pretty painful to maintain, depending on how they did it)
[04:38:17] <oldlaptop> and https://github.com/LumoSQL/LumoSQL (though interesting) appears to suffer from that problem to some degree?

[04:39:45] <oldlaptop> That would depend on the definition of "big websites". Sometimes because it's genuinely not suitable for one reason or another (for example because lots of write concurrency is needed), sometimes because the default (and usually wrong) choice is mysql
[04:40:10] <duuude> oh, is tcl a dependency for sqlite?

[04:42:15] <oldlaptop> the "amalgamation" file doesn't need anything other than a standard C compiler and libc, IIRC.
[04:42:22] <oldlaptop> (And most of libc is negotiable)
[04:43:23] <oldlaptop> I don't know offhand how these LMDB backends implement locking. A different backend might be able to "solve" that problem a little better than sqlite's wal mode does, I guess?
[04:43:43] <oldlaptop> You still have the problem of (potentially) independent processes trying to coordinate access.

[05:32:34] <TonyStone> So maybe someone can help me out here.  I made a multi threaded application that starts a thread for each cpu thread reported by the system.  Works good and all EXCEPT on my server with 2 physical CPUs.  My program does not seem to ever execute and use more than 50 percent of the total available CPUs available on the system...
[05:33:28] <TonyStone> I was looking at setting CPU affinity in my program to try and address this but it has me wondering this:  can my process create threads that can execute on a physical second CPU... ?
[05:33:59] <TonyStone> I am running Linux by the way...
[05:34:07] <flaqoniun> usually
[05:34:12] <flaqoniun> depends on the linux
[05:34:23] <TonyStone> ubuntu server 18.x
[05:34:45] <flaqoniun> lscpu lists 2 online CPU's?
[05:35:04] <TonyStone> yep
[05:35:21] <TonyStone> well it says 0-39
[05:35:33] <TonyStone> 10 core CPUs with hyper threading.
[05:35:35] <oldlaptop> There's no particular reason your process is "tied" to one physical CPU, if that's what you're asking. More likely, whatever API you're using to determine how many CPUs are present is for some reason not telling you how many threads are present in total.
[05:35:36] <flaqoniun> thats a little weird eh?
[05:35:48] <TonyStone> so they are listed as seperate CPUs
[05:35:52] <oldlaptop> (You haven't told us what that is, so all we can do is speculate.)
[05:36:23] <flaqoniun> probably a bug in your fork/clone code
[05:36:24] <TonyStone> well my API does tell me there is "40 CPUs"

[07:49:46] <ProfSimm> :D
[07:49:54] <sonny> so ... a broken stylus
[07:50:17] <EdFletcher> styluses were clearly broken on their own, hence why SJ was adamant against their use 
[07:50:23] <ProfSimm> sonny: yes like how ice-cream is a broken hot chocolate.
[07:50:31] <amigojapan> Apple fanboys would defend Apple even if they killed babies
[07:50:37] <duuude> ProfSimm: Is the fact that you can't tap stuff with the pencil in its favor?
[07:50:45] <sonny> EdFletcher I actually like the idea of ditching the stylus tbh
[07:50:48] <ProfSimm> duuude: yes.
[07:51:04] <sonny> but that needs the small form factor and special UI / apps
[07:51:12] <duuude> ProfSimm: Isn't it just being able to do less when it could do more?
[07:51:12] <EdFletcher> amigojapan: i'm not just a fanoi, i'm an ex-employee. so yes, i'm biased but also very protective of one of the best places i've ever worked. 
[07:51:32] <sonny> e.g. the apple watch idea is a great example
[07:51:37] <duuude> stylus sucks
[07:51:45] <sonny> oops, used e.g. twice
[07:51:46] <duuude> mechanical keyboards rock
[07:51:47] <amigojapan> EdFletcher: evil
[07:51:51] <ProfSimm> duuude: the device can differentiate both inputs and react differently. It's akin to a pencil. When you drag your finger on paper, do you leave a lead trace? No. Why should a drawing app be so dumb them.
[07:51:58] <EdFletcher> sonny: yeah and that's what they wanted to do with the pencil, ditch the stylus for something better 
[07:52:14] <ProfSimm> duuude: for example a drawing app can have you draw with the pencil, erase with the other end, and smudge with your fingers
[07:52:22] <ProfSimm> duuude: it's what you do on paper, it's how artists work
[07:52:56] <ProfSimm> duuude: it's pointless to tap things with the pencil, because you already have fingers
[07:53:08] <sonny> I mean they already have hardware/apps for artists
[07:53:09] <EdFletcher> amigojapan: excuse me, are you calling me evil? that's quite rude. and even if it's just the company, still rude. they are _far_ less evil than 95% of companies their size. 
[07:53:22] <sonny> all that for a general device is just meh
[07:53:31] <ProfSimm> sonny: sure. But those same apps are more expressive with a pencil, that's touch-sensitive and so on.
[07:53:34] <sonny> but the point still stands
[07:53:43] <duuude> ProfSimm: nice 
[07:53:48] <EdFletcher> amigojapan: i'm guessing you use no products from any Fortune 500 company then, given your zealous stance? 
[07:53:50] <amigojapan> In Apple devices you don't control your own device Apple controls your device is what I am referring to EdFletcher 
[07:54:17] <sonny> some days I really wish I could have a notebook device that lets me create anything I can imagine ... for that I need a stylus
[07:54:45] <duuude> whataboutery doesn't fix Apple not letting you fully make use of what you paid for
[07:54:56] <sonny> how is that related?
[07:54:57] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: you never control your own device. Have you browsed the web recently. Have you sometimes ended up on a page that's URGING YOU THAT YOU HAVE A VIRUS, FIX NOW FREE ANTIVIRUS
[07:54:58] <sonny> lol
[07:54:59] <EdFletcher> amigojapan: this is true about nearly all devices you buy at the moment: the difference is if it is hidden or not. apple does not hide it. also, that is not "evil", evil is murder and rape. talk about hyperbolic exaggeration... 
[07:55:14] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: who controls your browser.
[07:55:38] <ProfSimm> amigojapan: it's about do you trust Apple more than some random scammer. And people do.
[07:56:12] <EdFletcher> and yeah, speaking of trust, i know of no company that goes to the lengths Apple does to protect user privacy. so if we're talking evil in that regard, they're the least of the evils. 
[07:56:12] <sonny> the pencil argument is kinda weak, seems like pride (from apple)

[07:56:51] <sonny> handwriting to text has to be one of the coolest apps ever ... still waiting for that to return
[07:57:14] <ProfSimm> sonny: I don't know why you need to dumb their design considerations down, as if they do everything based on pride and can't think. I'm sure they have no touch-screen laptops also out of pride, yes?
[07:57:34] <amigojapan> I just want a Linux phone with the proper apps like Google maps
[07:57:40] <sonny> I haven't dumbed anything down
[07:57:43] <EdFletcher> amigojapan: FUCK richard stallman, first of all. he's a cancer on the community. and if _that's_ the crux of your arguments then no wonder they're all so weak. i'm done with this: you have no clue what you're talking about, clearly. 
[07:57:49] <duuude> ProfSimm: they could put some way of enabling stuff that is hard for people that ignorant. also that doesn't explain why you couldn't develop for iOS without Xcode, not giving you freedom to repair anywhere, bluetooth not being interoperable with other stuff for a long time, etc. etc. etc.

[08:55:24] <kee> We already have “to have not regressed”.

[08:57:19] <flaqoniun> i don't think it would work, what would create the memory maps for the "real" os after it comes back online

[08:59:41] <duuude> so there is no way of running an application without OS
[08:59:42] <kee> And then it works out the program's memory map and stuff, and adds that to its memory map and doesn't blitz the memory.
[08:59:53] <apotheon> kee: For that to work, the OS has to be able to decipher the internal state of every program it ever encounters.
[09:00:00] <kee> It doesn't need to.
[09:00:07] <apotheon> . . . rather than just receive program ouput.
[09:00:09] <kee> It just needs to decipher the data left behind by the old memory allocator.
[09:00:29] <kee> Then it interrupts the core that's running the application, sets up its OSy goodness, and the application has an OS to talk to again.
[09:00:31] <flaqoniun> oh like normally the bootloader clears the OS's memory so it assumes everything is 0's but on the fake reboot it doesn't clear anything... hmmm
[09:00:34] <apotheon> How can you get data out of a program with no I/O unless the OS can decipher its internal state?
[09:00:51] <kee> apotheon: Because the program still does I/O.

[09:01:38] <kee> while there wasn't an OS.
[09:01:47] <apotheon> Programs have I/O.
[09:01:47] <kee> It can do those while there's an OS, just not while there isn't.
[09:01:55] <apotheon> That's how data gets in and out.
[09:02:14] <apotheon> That's why it's called I/O.
[09:02:23] <oldlaptop> It could perform a bunch of computation, then do the I/O once the OS is running again.
[09:02:38] <sonny> llanhmod have any more favourites?
[09:02:40] <apotheon> Sure . . . if it *has I/O capability*.
[09:02:43] <oldlaptop> (I don't see how that's fundamentally all that different from how the OS normally does context switching, though.)
[09:02:46] <apotheon> If it doesn't, it doesn't.
[09:02:59] <apotheon> It was kee who said it doesn't have I/O.
[09:03:30] <kee>  1 OS starts. 2 Program starts. 3 Program does some I/O. 4 OS tells the program it's shutting down. 5 Program stops doing I/O. 6 OS shuts down. 7 Application does thinking but doesn't attempt I/O or floating point. 8 OS starts. 9 OS discovers application running on another core. 10 OS tells application it's started. 11 Application does I/O.
[09:03:38] <kee> apotheon: Is that clear?
[09:03:48] <apotheon> I also don't think not having I/O is even meaningful for the argument that it's not effectively an OS.
[09:04:09] <kee> By that logic, all applications are OSs that simply choose not to attempt to run privileged instructions.
[09:04:19] <apotheon> How does the OS tell the application anything if the application has no input?
[09:04:27] <kee> It has input normally?
[09:04:31] <sonny> lol
[09:04:33] <kee> It just doesn't while there's nothing to get input from.
[09:04:35] <apotheon> but it shut off input
[09:04:37] <kee> Yeah.
[09:04:45] <kee> Then the OS un-shuts it off.

[09:05:01] <llanhmod> sonny: not really,  enjoying the application specific OS talk though. not truly following, sorry.
[09:05:02] <apotheon> How does it know to start again without receiving input telling it to start?
[09:05:06] <kee> Don't know how to explain it any better, sorry.
[09:05:12] <kee> You know that Linux has signals?
[09:05:18] <kee> The OS can just call a signal handler or something.

[09:05:30] <sonny> llanhmod no worries
[09:05:38] <apotheon> oldlaptop: Now we're back to the OS understanding every application.
[09:05:38] <oldlaptop> Signal handler, frobs a magic bit in its address space, something.
[09:05:50] <kee> apotheon: Linux doesn't understand every application, but it can do signals.
[09:05:53] <apotheon> oldlaptop: It has to be able to reach into the application and flip an I/O switch somewhere.

[09:06:23] <apotheon> okay, so
[09:06:52] <apotheon> . . . those are OS stuff.  How does the application even do signals if it doesn't use system calls?
[09:07:26] <oldlaptop> It presumably sets them up before the OS vanishes, and then suddenly starts getting them when it resurrects itself.
[09:07:29] <apotheon> Everything I can think of to do this essentially requires another OS.
[09:07:42] <apotheon> oldlaptop: How?
[09:07:54] <apotheon> This seems self-contradictory unless there's another OS involved.
[09:08:05] <flaqoniun> there would have to be a trap to catch anything that tries to call to the OS

[09:08:47] <kee> apotheon: The application can just have a dummy handler.

[09:09:24] <apotheon> flaqoniun: presumably with the OS state reset to zero
[09:09:27] <kee> apotheon: It doesn't have to be magic.

[09:09:59] <oldlaptop> Well, it has to know about the weird vanishing act, sure. It gets SIGOSISGOINGBYEBYE and knows it can't make any syscalls until its handler for SIGOHAITHEOSISBACK gets called.
[09:10:16] <apotheon> How does the OS even know what regions of memory to leave alone when booting?
[09:10:18] <oldlaptop> (Those look more like ioctls than signals.)
[09:10:26] <kee> apotheon: How does any OS know that?
[09:10:28] <apotheon> I could see it overwriting part of program state on boot.

[09:11:04] <apotheon> That's not an answer, then.
[09:11:13] <oldlaptop> You can make some arbitrary rule that it can't touch memory outside 0x00 - 0xDEADBEEF or something.

[09:11:29] <apotheon> it got shut down

[09:12:07] <oldlaptop> I understand this whole idea to involve nothing actually shutting down, as far as the hardware is concerned.
[09:12:17] <kee> oldlaptop is right: it doesn't have to be something complicated like the memory allocator state.
[09:12:19] <apotheon> There's also the problem that for most code still running you *do* want to kill its current state when rebooting.
[09:12:29] <kee> It can just be a list of things to remember, like "there's a program running over there".

[09:13:00] <kee> Microsoft Windows has a fast startup, where it kills some programs and hibernates others.

[09:13:56] <apotheon> When your answer is "I refuse to acknowledge an actual conflict within the idea", the answer is "magic".
[09:13:59] <kee> Or oldlaptop's default signal handler solution.
[09:14:03] <apotheon> Windows doesn't do it.
[09:14:04] <kee> There are many different possibilities.
[09:14:10] <apotheon> It doesn't keep applications running while it's shut down.
[09:14:23] <apotheon> You're saying to do it the way nothing does it.
[09:14:24] <kee> Windows shuts down some programs and hibernates others.
[09:14:37] <apotheon> . . . no, not when Windows actually shuts down.
[09:14:38] <kee> You were asking how the OS made the distinction: Windows makes a similar distinction.
[09:14:52] <kee> It doesn't do the whole idea, but it does this one part.
[09:15:07] <kee> So that bit is a solved problem, not a gotcha.
[09:15:13] <apotheon> . . . and if you're talking about hibernation, that's not at all keeping an application running.
[09:15:21] <apotheon> That's just saving state to persistent storage.
[09:15:30] <kee> And even if you discount Windows, oldlaptop has described an alternate implementation.
[09:15:48] <apotheon> The question is about memory and CPU (which I haven't even raised yet) being *active* and not being used by the OS.
[09:16:01] <apotheon> You need something to manage RAM.  You've somehow moved that out of the OS, now.
[09:16:07] <kee> This was just a silly idea based on my childhood misunderstanding of how computers worked, but having talked it through with everyone here, I'm pretty confident I could make this.
[09:16:14] <kee> apotheon: You don't need something to manage RAM if the application doesn't allocate.
[09:16:25] <apotheon> . . . because if the OS manages it, the process of booting could obliterate your program, plus the application wouldn't be able to use RAM while the OS has been shut down.
[09:16:39] <apotheon> The application can't use RAM at all . . . ?
[09:16:39] <kee> … Do you know how OSs work?

[09:16:43] <kee> That's not how OSs work.
[09:16:53] <apotheon> What application doesn't use RAM?
[09:17:00] <kee> You don't need an OS to use RAM.
[09:17:08] <kee> You need the virtual memory tables in the CPU to be set up properly.
[09:17:20] <kee> The OS is responsible for setting it up, but the OS doesn't need to be "running" while that happens.

[09:18:41] <kee> Same way it does with an OS.

[09:55:16] <InPhase> novns: You remember how there was useradd to abstract away editing /etc/passwd, and then useradd wasn't good enough so some systems added adduser, with behavior that diverged a bit from one system to the next eventually.

[10:13:05] <ProfSimm> pulse: not to mention the discomfort of having to wear the glasses in the first place
[10:13:22] <pulse> apotheon, hmm. i have a vague memory of someone possibly on video demonstrating fast multiplication and division of 3-digit numbers with fingers. but that's about all i remember
[10:13:29] <apotheon> . . . so you count to nine on one hand, but lowering fingers across the hand then raising them across the same hand, then reset the hand and mark one finger with the other hand to show the first 10s place digit.
[10:13:37] <pulse> EdFletcher, would that really help though
[10:13:46] <apotheon> oh, actual arithmetic
[10:13:51] <pulse> ProfSimm, yeah, assuming the resolution gets good enough though
[10:13:51] <apotheon> I don't think I've seen that one.
[10:14:12] <pulse> apotheon, i think it was an asian dude and it was some traditional technique, but i'm stretching my memory at this point
[10:14:53] <ProfSimm> pulse: I wouldn't be surprised if it's both more expensive to buy such VR glasses, and more expensive in terms of electricity to use them, compare to 2-3 decent displays.
[10:15:08] <ProfSimm> pulse: because such resolution would tax both the GPU/CPU and your wallet
[10:15:08] <pulse> ProfSimm, i think the nose breaking headset is a deal breaker too. seems painful. still, the idea isn't too wacky, if they solved all the technical aspects
[10:15:12] <apotheon> I might go searching for that at some point, but probably not until Saturday at least.  I've got some road tripping in my future.

[10:22:17] <pulse> what about semi-distant future though
[10:22:24] <pulse> if VR sets are perfected
[10:22:25] <apotheon> still don't
[10:22:36] <ProfSimm> pulse: it'll happen when we can beam the image directly to our brain
[10:22:43] <ProfSimm> pulse: then I see it
[10:22:44] <pulse> if all you needed is a pair of normal looking glasses, and you could set up a virtual environment
[10:22:48] <apotheon> yeah, what ProfSimm said
[10:23:09] <apotheon> If your brain can just directly create the code without having to use any external gesturing or whatever, then we're getting somewhere.
[10:23:14] <pulse> you know what would be the best actually. a set of AR glasses that look like normal glasses, but when you put them on you can put various floating windows all around you and interface with your physical peripherals
[10:23:22] <ProfSimm> We don' have a USB-C port at the back of our heads or something.
[10:23:36] <ProfSimm> gon*
[10:23:40] <pulse> then all you'd need is a desk with a computer, keyboard, mouse, and the AR headset. and you could see through to see your keyboard and all that surrounds you
[10:23:51] <apotheon> That USB-C port had better not be Microsoft tech.
[10:24:22] <apotheon> I'm not letting closed source shit take over my brain.
[10:24:23] <pulse> ProfSimm, contrary to popular belief, i don't actually believe our current state of science understands even 0.1% of how the brain works :p
[10:24:27] <ProfSimm> apotheon: I'm sorry, you're not compatible with Windows 11, so please have children, and die, and we can install Windows 11 on them.
[10:24:31] <pulse> i wouldn't count on any "USB ports" anytime soon
[10:24:53] <apotheon> It's more likely to be a wireless implant anyway.
[10:25:04] <ProfSimm> pulse: we don't need to understand it.
[10:25:16] <apotheon> . . . and a bunch of people will get them before there has even been sufficient testing of long-term effects to know the downsides.
[10:25:29] <apotheon> It might not happen for fifty years or more, though.
[10:25:35] <ProfSimm> pulse: we don't understand how neural networks work. Except in a superficial way. As in too close and too far away. 
[10:25:45] <ProfSimm> pulse: but they work
[10:26:05] <pulse> i disagree, we know exactly how neural networks work
[10:26:08] <apotheon> The main problem with predictions of the nearness of the singularity is how much governmental interference in the economy hinders development.
[10:26:09] <ProfSimm> Nah.
[10:26:35] <pulse> we do not understand how a trained neural network classifies something correctly, but that's only due to it being too complex. we could in theory trace every neuron and we would understand it
[10:26:42] <ProfSimm> pulse: I mean this is how our brain works. If we "understood exactly how NN work" then we understand our brain, which is a NN
[10:26:49] <pulse> it's just too much legwork and nobody wants to do it
[10:26:56] <apotheon> We understand how neural networks work in principle, but not how a specific neural network works in practice, I think.
[10:27:01] <apotheon> . . . but I'm not an expert.
[10:27:21] <ProfSimm> pulse: tracing every neuron and so on assumes that reductionism works in this case. And it doesn't
[10:27:49] <ProfSimm> pulse: we know how every neuron works. But we don't know how come they work together like that
[10:27:56] <ProfSimm> MAGIC
[10:27:57] <pulse> ProfSimm, in my opinion, a NN is a poor imitation of the brain. we don't understand how brains work, at all
[10:28:08] <apotheon> Calling the human brain a neural network in the same sense as what are designed in "AI" classes is kind of a broad, sweeping hand-wave that ignores a lot of stuff we don't fully get about the human brain.
[10:28:11] <ProfSimm> pulse: pretty good for a poor imitation
[10:28:17] <pulse> ProfSimm, sure, they're very useful

[11:26:13] <ProfSimm> jeaye: my thing is very similar to LISP/Clojure in some ways. 
[11:26:29] <jeaye> Though, there are no operators, so the conflation you're talking about doesn't exist. They are indeed just functions.

[11:27:17] <ProfSimm> jeaye: right, because operator symbols are just "letters" of sort. But I don't like this. I prefer operators that are infix operator to work like infix operators.
[11:27:20] <jeaye> Arguably, having a language separate some functions (like arithmetic) from others syntactically is more complex.
[11:27:41] <ProfSimm> jeaye: not that complex turns out. Like 200-300 lines in the parser

[11:28:56] <jeaye> That whole approach is also irregular, in the sense of someone learning a language. "Ok, Timmy, how do you call foo and pass it bar? Great. Now, how do you add foo and bar? Nope, remember, it's a different syntax."
[11:29:55] *** Joins: swinnenb (~swinnenb@user/swinnenb)
[11:29:58] <ProfSimm> jeaye: well if Timmy insists, in mine he can write   add (5, 5)  and it'll reformat it to 5 + 5.
[11:30:11] <jeaye> Also, when things like + are baked into the language, they're not first class functions.
[11:30:14] <ProfSimm> jeaye: and if he types 5 + 5, internally in the AST it's add (5, 5)
[11:30:41] <jeaye> i.e. I can't use the same + to reduce over a sequence.

[13:45:40] <TheLinuxNerd> I tried minetest with the trackball
[13:46:37] <ProfSimm> pulse: I'm doing it with transactions/savepoints. I can parse ahead and if I smell colon, I drop the last term I parsed, restore the token stream to the state it had before it and insert the implicit comma straight into the stream.
[13:46:37] <TheLinuxNerd> instantly, placed a finger on the ball and imagined the ball is the head turning in the direction I want to look in, I'm actually better at it, cause it feels 3D pointing instead of 2D pointing and so much more natural O_O

[17:34:33] <epony> it is similar on SSD drives too, there is a microcontroller-processor chip and the new ones have their own flash area internally, and they pick and store data for their service operation from the device reserved service area
[17:35:35] <epony> the typical cause for problems with flash storage (and their controllers), includes eMMC too, is power loss or cycle or abrupt termination of operation recurring while they are doing some internal service operation

[17:36:57] <epony> some drives may just get "confused" or stuck and a reflashing might bring them back without affecting the stored data, but that requires good command of their programmer utilities for flashing only the "non-unique" regions
[17:37:38] <epony> all oprating systems have same ingrained weaknesses on their "partitioning" and "boot blocks"

[18:38:44] <Sqaure> I see no way laptops could technically be more cost effective

[21:05:52] <sonny> as long as you have to store on disk (which is what a filesystem takes care of) then it won't be beneficial
[21:05:53] <austincheney> sonny, ultraRAM is ram level performance that will replace hard disks if it becomes a thing

[21:06:33] <sonny> sure, I can see that for consumer devices
[21:06:37] <sonny> let me read the article
[21:06:47] <kee> We will still have separate RAM and storage.
[21:06:53] <kee> Like we currently have separate swap and storage
[21:07:07] <kee> And we have a separate /tmp to storage.
[21:07:10] <GeDaMo> The paper is open https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aelm.202101103
[21:07:13] <austincheney> actually ultraRAM will be a bit faster than RAM.  Intel Octane Persistent memory achieved a 2.5x performance increase because it did not have to refresh the memory contents every 65ms or so

[22:58:42] <pyzozord> Rounin: right I think there is a difference between what level is required to parse vs execute some logic. And those powers can be both described in terms of grammars
[22:59:01] <oldlaptop> There's unfortunately no substitute for typing on a keyboard with them, and unfortunately the keyboards are not all that cheap.

[22:59:45] <pyzozord> Rounin: so maybe we need context-free grammar to parse the range so we can produce a machine that can a accept regular expression? Or something lik ethat

[23:55:16] <pyzozord> s/for/at the/
[23:55:56] <epony> that can go away with touch typing but you generally don't benefit from it that much

[23:58:08] <terminalpusher> I don't think I benefit from touch typing that much. I pretty much only use my index fingers to type and my thumbs but I think I can still type reasonably fast
[23:58:13] <GeDaMo> "jumops", eh? :P
[23:58:29] <hans> written without looking at the keyboard (written with eyes closed actually)
[23:58:40] <GeDaMo> Fair enough, I can't do that :P

[23:58:58] <epony> well, riding a bike without hands is doable but with eyes closed, not so much ;-)
[23:58:59] <InPhase> GeDaMo: You can't touch type?  It's 2022.  :)
[23:59:14] <GeDaMo> I type fast enough
[23:59:25] <hans> no, we need to go faster!
[23:59:25] <GeDaMo> Besides, programming isn't about typing

[23:59:49] <InPhase> GeDaMo: Well of course, but with so much time at a computer, doesn't it just emerge naturally?
