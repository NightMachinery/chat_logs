[11:53:07] <festerdam> I installed openvpn-as-bundled-clients on Debian 11. How do I open the client?
[12:03:34] <festerdam> The OpenVPN3 install guide is also seriously outdated.
[12:03:51] <festerdam> At https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/OpenVPN3Linux
[12:04:58] <festerdam> There's no bullseye repository and the buster version relies on an outdated dependency.7
[12:06:14] <festerdam> Do I need to compile openvpn3 or is there anywhere a .deb or binary for recent versions of Debian?

[12:32:19] <rob0> you are confusing the community openvpn with the commercial software
[12:34:09] <rob0> Best place for paying customers with AS questions, openvpn.net/support/
[12:40:23] <festerdam> Oh, I din't want to connect to the commecial service. I'm trying to connect to my university's network (necessary to use some of their services). I now noticed Debian already has an openvpn package in the repository. I'm now having trouble configuring the connection.
[12:40:58] <festerdam> What do I give --ifconfig? My public ip and the public ip I want to connect to?
[12:44:02] <rob0> Your administrator gave you a profile?  Does it include certificate/key?  Or were you supposed to submit a certificate signing request?
[12:45:15] <rob0> If your admin is using Access Server (the proprietary software), all you need it your username/password and that profile.
[12:46:22] <rob0> OpenVPN3-Linux has probably not made it to Debian stable yet
[12:46:32] <rob0> just use "openvpn"
[12:47:47] <rob0> openvpn-as-bundled-clients is something an Access Server admin would install on the AS host.
[12:47:59] <rob0> you do not want that
[12:49:44] <festerdam> Ok, I think I should turn towards the uni for help, because I'm going through all this because the official recommended approach did not work.
[12:51:37] <rob0> who recommended what approach?
[12:52:10] <rob0> you did not answer my questions.
[12:53:15] <rob0> did the university give you any instructions?
[12:53:39] <festerdam> Did, but it did not involve openvpn.

[21:07:15] <KNERD> I just can't get outside the network with nftables. Anyone know of a guide? STrangely, I was able to get the old VPN functioning wit nftables, but duplicating from that is not working out
[21:15:18] <KNERD> on the old VPN I used the three following commands:
[21:15:25] <KNERD> nft add table ip NAT
[21:15:27] <KNERD> nft add chain ip NAT my_masquerade '{ type nat hook postrouting priority 100; }'
[21:15:29] <KNERD> nft add rule NAT my_masquerade ip saddr { 10.9.0.0/24 } oifname enp3s0 masquerade
[21:36:06] <rob0> nftables wiki and #netfilter
[21:36:34] <rob0> we in OpenVPN have remained with iptables
[21:49:20] <KNERD> okay
[22:42:20] <KNERD> rob0: i went ahead and yanked nf tables off and using iptables, and the problem went away
