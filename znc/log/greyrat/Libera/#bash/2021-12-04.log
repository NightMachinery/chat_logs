[05:39:48] <iam8up> the way i understand it, is if i throw in parallel it's just going to do the same file input say 5 times entirely as opposed to separating the queries

[13:02:48] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/009 -- What is buffering?  Or, why does my command line produce no output: tail -f logfile | grep 'foo bar' | awk ...
[13:03:09] <emanuele6> that page might be helpful
[13:03:34] <emanuele6> it seems that that problem needs to be run in a terminal to work
[13:03:57] <emanuele6> you can trick it into thinking it is running in a terminal using a tool like expect's unbuffer

[16:04:28] <emanuele6> xx: POSIX sh does not have local, but dash does
[16:06:33] <kurahaupo> sh# f() { a='some string'; local b ; b=$a; echo "$b"; }; f
[16:06:34] <shbot> kurahaupo: some string
[16:07:30] <xx> yeah that works, I was demonstrating the construct where assignment is not the first part on the line, i.e. `local b=$a` vs `b=$a`
[16:07:53] <xx> could be export instead if you wanted
[16:08:00] <kurahaupo> The trick is to avoid combining the variable state commands like "local" and "export", from the assignments
[16:08:31] <xx> yes, that's the right way of doing it
[16:08:38] <kurahaupo> Which shellcheck recommends anyway when $() is involved
[16:08:52] <xx> shellcheck ignores a few cases due to them being used far too often
[16:10:11] * kurahaupo can remember the Bourne shell before assignments were allowed to be combined with "export" so one would write var=value export var
[16:10:56] <flower_> gnoo, holy! But it works :)

[21:36:31] <earnest> tangy: Yes
[21:36:34] <tangy> seems like that ould be one of those 'not very well defined' cases
[21:36:54] <tangy> okay
[21:37:00] <earnest> # true | false; declare -p "$?"
[21:37:01] <shbot> earnest: bash: declare: 1: not found
[21:37:15] <earnest> Hm
[21:37:16] <Blondie101010> no one will complain if you use one or the other, but if you combine both, even properly, someone will complain for sure
[21:38:10] <tangy> yeah, I just didn't want it to break later on,
[21:38:30] <earnest> tangy: In bash you have things like pipefail or PIPESTATUS to change the standard behaviour
[21:38:46] <Blondie101010> [[ $val = 'a' ]] && break
[21:38:56] <earnest> As otherwise things like: if cmd | grep foo; then ...; fi would not work

[21:39:13] <earnest> Or, if ! cmd | grep foo; then ...; fi
[21:39:27] <Blondie101010> well simply don't pipe commands that can fail
