[08:49:50] <Cl0udNinja> have I gone dumb at math
[08:50:08] <Cl0udNinja> 4*(1024^2)-1 IS NOT 4103
[08:50:12] <Cl0udNinja> RIGHT?!
[08:56:17] <Cl0udNinja> oh wow... I did have a dumb
[08:56:18] <emag> Cl0udNinja: assuming normal order of operations, i'm coming up 4194303 on an hp48 emulator on my phone
[08:56:25] <Cl0udNinja> ^ isnt exponential operation in C
[08:56:34] <emag> hahahaha
[08:57:25] <Cl0udNinja> that -REALLY- bothers me for some reason
[08:58:22] <Cl0udNinja> also I have a lot of fucking code to fix now
[08:58:34] <xe0n> so will my usb hub be ready next week?
[09:00:57] <Cl0udNinja> hush you
[09:01:02] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[09:01:17] <Cl0udNinja> what do you think I'm programming for atm :P

[10:53:19] <csws> even if you have a bunch of jobs kick off at once, it's not like veeam will process them all in parallel?
[10:53:25] <csws> since there's a job limit on your backup proxy
[10:53:30] <Jay-Ros> number of concurrent jobs = max number of parallel jobs from proxies

[16:39:21] <gdarko> Client is using WordPress as a membership site and it is nightmare to scale up. We did a load test with Loadster and 50 concurrent users that log in and browse the members are is possible with one c5a.xlarge + 2dns t.3 medium instances. Now for more than 50 concurrent users i bumped the instance to c5a.2xlarge and it can't even handle 80. Same if i try with c5a.4xlarge.
[16:40:07] <sd> 10<n‚Äãakade> can't go for horizontal scaling?  DB broken out?

[16:40:47] <sd> 15<R‚ÄãayanFar> it would not work without battery?
[16:40:57] <gdarko> So, there is probably bottleneck with the network regardless of the size of the instance it looks like the network can't handle that much traffic.
[16:41:12] <sd> 11<t‚Äãelgareith> i've heard of ones that straight won't work without a battery

[16:42:07] <zetorian> I'd take a look at your php workers and how the pool is holding up. I've seen c5a.large's handle ~100 users on a well optimized site
[16:43:09] <zetorian> another thing to take a look at is how they are handling crons. some shitty wp sites run their crons inside the fpm workers during a request

[16:47:22] <gdarko> zetorian, i offloaded the cron to the native linux cron and configured the php-fpm connections according to the ram. for 8gb instance i set it pm=static, max_children=51, start_servers=12, min_spare_servers=12, max_spare_servers=38.

[16:48:36] <zetorian> that all looks fine
[16:49:29] <zetorian> gdarko: what are you seeing for individual response times in the php access log?
[16:51:14] <estranger> it cant do 80 users? it's prob not network.
[16:52:24] <gdarko> it just hangs and returning 503 error, i noticed that the site slows down once 80 concurrent users are logged in no matter how much cpu cores or ram memory is available. I even tried with the c5a.4xlarge. The screenshots the bots receive is just not fully rendered page or taking more than 10-15 seconds to load the page.
[16:52:25] <estranger> is there a db connection pool that's getting maxed?
[16:52:35] <gdarko> This site uses ElastiCache / Redis

[16:53:43] <estranger> is it web scale?
[16:55:26] <estranger> if it's not resource bound it's prob a threading limit somewhere... I dunno jack about WordPress though
[16:55:35] <gdarko> sd: It's a membership site with LearnDash LMS and we can't cache the member area, this is where the problem start. We don't use external APIs.
[16:56:16] <estranger> isn't elasticcache fresh garbage?
[16:56:49] <gdarko> HyperDB is working, i was seeing max connections errors but i bumped from t3.micro to t3.medium and i don't see database related errors.
[16:57:28] <estranger> ahh hyperdb is a WordPress thing not a db
[16:58:03] <gdarko> It's a way to scale the databases horizontally in WordPress. Automatic uses it on their proprietary Wordpress.com platform, but it also works well from hearing other people stories.
[16:58:37] <zetorian> I'd strace a php worker under load. should give you an idea what it's hanging on
[16:59:35] <gdarko> zetorian, how do you do that?
[17:00:23] <zetorian> 'strace -ff -T -p <pid_of_php_worker>'
[17:00:37] <zetorian> it'll spit out the syscalls the worker is doing.
[17:01:02] <zetorian> you're looking for it spinning on either select, poll, or epoll
[17:01:38] <zetorian> then find the file descriptor related to that call, and tha'll be connected to what the workers are hanging on.
[17:01:52] <gdarko> Also, i disabled the access log as a performance tweak, but i will check the response times.
[17:02:11] <gdarko> Thanks for this, will try.
[17:02:30] <zetorian> best of luck!
[17:02:37] <zetorian> (php is a real bitch sometimes)
[17:02:49] <estranger> scaling out monoliths is fun
[17:03:01] <estranger> surprised 80 users is a crunch though
[17:07:20] <zetorian> I had a site a while ago that did cookies via file locking a set file in /tmp for each user.
[17:07:59] <zetorian> it would grind to a halt at whatever number of workers we gave it cause each cookie required an exclusive lock before the worker would run

[18:11:59] <PublicWiFi> so why wouldn't he just use a wildcard or something
[18:12:04] <xe0n> no, not wildcard
[18:12:05] <PublicWiFi> this cert has like 5 SANs lol
[18:12:07] <xe0n> ANYTHING but them.
[18:12:15] <PublicWiFi> so is there any harm to doing it that way then?
[18:12:18] <sd> 02<r‚Äãyalln> yeah wild cards are a no go nowdays
[18:12:19] <xe0n> get an exchange cert configured with just the required CN and SANs for exchange

[18:12:24] <xe0n> dump it onto the thing in front
[18:12:28] <PublicWiFi> ah gotcha
[18:12:35] <PublicWiFi> so that's how it is now i think
[18:12:43] <nobyk> What's wrong with a wildcard cert
[18:12:45] <PublicWiFi> gotta rewnew it soon so I'm making sure i don't fuck it up
[18:12:57] <xe0n> because i dont want the 100 services the wildcard is using to expire all at the same time
[18:13:01] <PublicWiFi> so Im gonna just add the new one to exchange and cutover the services so I don't have to re-key
[18:13:10] <xe0n> certificates are part of the costs towards a project, you buy a cert for a service, and manage it for that service
[18:13:11] <nobyk> oh
[18:13:13] <PublicWiFi> xe0n: that.. makes sense
[18:13:19] <PublicWiFi> maybe I should re-key actually nvm
[18:13:22] <xe0n> i rather have 50 certs expire at different times than one wildcard that expires and 50 things break at once.

[18:14:13] <xe0n> anyway....yeah we do the same with with our external services, have an F5 in front of them
[18:14:16] <nobyk> easier to automate with letsencrypt too
[18:14:18] <xe0n> and the certs for the services are also loaded onto the F5
[18:14:19] <sd> 02<r‚Äãyalln> certs is a mythical thing  you learn once and never do again for 2 years
[18:14:20] <xe0n> and used when proxying
[18:14:23] <nobyk> challenges are easier
[18:14:36] <xe0n> certs are a thing you manage yearly...and should have documented...so the next time around it's a half an hour job instead of 2 hrs
[18:14:36] <xe0n> lol
[18:14:45] <xe0n> no LE...
[18:14:46] <xe0n> no thanks.
[18:14:49] <PublicWiFi> so your F5 hostname is just added to the exchange cert SAN portion?
[18:14:51] <sd> 02<r‚Äãyalln> That means A. the rpevious dude documented
[18:14:57] <PublicWiFi> so its identical to the exchange one?
[18:14:59] <xe0n> no, the F5 supports certificates per service
[18:15:03] <PublicWiFi> ah
[18:15:09] <xe0n> so multiple certs are on the F5, we assign them to the service rule
[18:15:10] <PublicWiFi> so the f5 mail cert then
[18:15:14] <xe0n> or whatever the terminology is
[18:15:18] <PublicWiFi> is same as exchange
[18:15:20] <PublicWiFi> ?
[18:15:24] <sd> 02<r‚Äãyalln> i need to get my internal certs working this week #someone do it for me
[18:15:30] <xe0n> its more...the exchange cert for the proxying on the f5 is on the f5
[18:15:33] <PublicWiFi> if you're window the windows CA isn't hard
[18:15:36] <xe0n> any external service's certs are on the F5
[18:15:42] <PublicWiFi> ahh gotcha
[18:15:55] <nobyk> Now LE's bad too?
[18:15:58] <xe0n> can assign a cert to a service, i.e the rule for exchange stuff
[18:15:59] <nobyk> Can't have anything nice can I
[18:16:17] <xe0n> yeah, i dont want certbot and shitty free certs in an environment...a cost of a cert should be included in the cost of managing X

[18:17:23] <xe0n> no thanks.
[18:17:29] <csws> and honestly if you can't automate it reliably and monitor it's working then maybe you're just braindead
[18:17:36] <xe0n> internal PKI can handle stuff an external cert cant, and if i need an external cert i'll buy one
[18:17:43] <csws> internal PKI is fine yeah
[18:17:50] <xe0n> yeah, no LE thanks
[18:17:54] <csws> and yeah for sccm and shit you need client certs from a PKI
[18:17:59] <csws> but external? lol
[18:18:25] <csws> boomers want certs that last forever with a million wildcards in the SAN
[18:18:35] <xe0n> if we've spent thousands of dollars on setting up X, can spend another hundred or two on a cert
[18:18:36] <csws> so I could never convince a business to use LE
