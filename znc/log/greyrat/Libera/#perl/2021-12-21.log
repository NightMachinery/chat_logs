[15:21:55] <Yaakov> I have to migrate my personal server infrastructure from an EOL bistro to a new one.  I plan to spin up a new VPS, configure it, and make the move. I am trying to work out the best strategy to do this with minimal disruption, particularly to email services.
[15:23:29] <Yaakov> I am currently using Sendmail, and it handles about 10 domains, and has a lot of aliases, virtual users, and spam rules. It also runs Spam Assassin and some DNSBL goop. I think I want to move from Sendmail. Does anyone have any suggestions about the best choice as an alternative?
[15:24:24] <Yaakov> I also use Apache and I expect I will continue to do that. It also has a complicated configuration, and I am hoping I can move that with minimal trouble.
[15:25:09] *** Quits: BSaboia (~bsaboia@177.37.198.107) (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[15:25:33] <Yaakov> At this point, I am picturing a vague use of proxy from the new server to Apache so I can move the domains and addresses to the new server first.

[15:29:31] <xq> exim and postfix are both good
[15:29:43] <LeoNerd> postfix is nice. I run that
[15:29:47] <xq> some people like one, other people equally like another
[15:30:00] <xq> worth checking out both to see which one you like
[15:30:17] <xq> I run exim
[15:38:54] <Yaakov> I have run both exam and postfix. The last I knew, I preferred postfix.
[15:39:25] <Yaakov> I would be running it now except I *literally* accidentally installed and configured Sendmail before I remembered that. 
[15:40:05] <Yaakov> Do you have any idea which one is easier to get running with things like smtpauth. spam assassin, and dnsbl thingies?
[15:40:32] <Yaakov> Also, which might be easiest to use with procmail?
[15:41:22] <LeoNerd> postfix runs procmail for me just fine though I expect exim would too. It's pretty standard
[15:42:36] <Yaakov> Yes, I expect so. I have just really been so far out of this stuff for literally years. I don't want to start something I will regret.

[18:54:16] <Guest9912> Hello. I'm trying to get doxygen working for my project. To test if it is working I'm using this basic exmaple and it is not working. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29033768/how-to-use-doxygen-and-doxygenfilterperl-to-generate-documentation-for-perl 
[18:54:17] <Guest9912> The steps are took are:
[18:54:17] <Guest9912> 1. Installed doxygen
[18:54:17] <Guest9912> 2. run command to generate config file.
[18:54:17] <Guest9912> 3. In the config file I changed 'input' field to be my test file. I also tried with nothing in the input field since that is only supposed to check the current directory. I also added .pm and .pl to a section called 'FILE_PATTERNS' sinceI didn't see it in the list of file types tested.
[18:54:17] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ How to use Doxygen and Doxygen::Filter::Perl to generate documentation for Perl sub routines? - S... ]
[18:54:21] <Guest9912> The only other line I changed was the project name. 
[18:54:23] <Guest9912> 4. run the command doxygen myConfigFile
[18:54:25] <Guest9912> 5. after that I tried two different commands, 
[18:54:27] <Guest9912> doxygen
[18:54:29] <Guest9912> doxygen test.pm
[18:54:31] <Guest9912> This is the output when I run doxygen test.pm
[18:54:35] <Guest9912> https://dpaste.org/5MHz#L3
[18:54:36] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ dpaste/5MHz (Console/Bash Session) ]
[18:54:37] <Guest9912> I think the problem is that doxygen is not seeing the end of the comment bloxk or something. The first warning is line 17 which is actual code and not comments but Im following the example and the documentation of doxygen here.. https://metacpan.org/pod/Doxygen::Filter::Perl
[18:54:39] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Doxygen::Filter::Perl - A perl code pre-filter for Doxygen - metacpan.org ]
[18:54:41] <Guest9912> Sorry for the wall of text, I wanted to come prepared with what I tried.

[19:01:40] <Yaakov> I feel as though this may actually go OK.
[19:07:19] <Altreus> surely the best way of using doxygen in perl is to put it in the POD
[19:07:36] <Altreus> =for doxygen\n\n(whatever you like)\n\n=cut
[19:08:03] <haj1> Guest9912: If I'm reading the docs correctly, you're not supposed to run doxygen directly on your Perl sources
[19:08:14] <Altreus> at this point my instinct would be to quit
[19:08:16] <Grinnz> Botje: correctly for text. you probably don't want binary data getting encoded to utf-8
[19:08:18] <Altreus> There are plenty of Perl jobs :P
[19:08:45] <Grinnz> also "correctly" is questionable, since it will create malformed strings if you use it for non-utf-8 input
[19:13:04] <Guest9912> @haj1 Oh really? When I look in the config file there is a section for 'INPUT' and this specifies where you want doxygen to work. https://dpaste.org/KsYG
[19:13:05] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ dpaste/KsYG (Console/Bash Session) ]
[19:13:55] <tirnanog> Grinnz: utf8 (not utf-8) would also happily encode invalid codepoints, right? I mean, there might be a warning, but it would still encode.
[19:14:38] <Grinnz> yes
[19:14:58] <haj1> Guest9912: Yeah, and as I see it you run doxygen on your Doxyfile (disclaimer: My last experience with doxygen was short, and 10 years agoe)
[19:14:59] <Grinnz> that's less of an issue cause you'd need to do it somewhat on purpose
[19:15:08] <Grinnz> there would not be a warning
[19:15:22] <tirnanog> yeah. still, it would remain a bad thing not to know the difference.
[19:21:49] <Guest9912> @haj1 Do you mean on the doxygen config file? So I just do doxygen configFile ?
[19:22:36] <haj1> Guest9912: That's what the example says: "/home/jordan/workspace/PerlDoxygen/trunk/> doxygen Doxyfile"
[19:23:07] <haj1> I guess Doxyfile (which is too large for me to read in short time) tells doxygen not only where the sources are, but also how to process them
[19:23:14] * gordonfish wonders what happens when one runs out of doxygen
[19:23:34] <Altreus> in perl, nothing
[19:24:09] <Altreus> It amazes me that perl is the only language I've heard of that considers documentation important
[19:24:32] <Altreus> and raku, if you must

[19:26:23] <Guest9912> hmm, allright I'll keep looking why its not working because I have ran the config file like in that example. In that example he only changed the input line and it worked

[19:32:39] <pragma-> Yes, I think so.
[19:33:31] <xenu> i think documentation writing culture is mainly caused by the fact that on metacpan.org (and search.cpan.org in the past) docs are the first thing you see on the module's page
[19:33:46] <xenu> for example the opposite of that is ocaml
[19:33:58] <xenu> until very recently there was no way at all to read module documentation online

[19:40:06] <pragma-> I have been reading this Haskell book over the last couple of months and I am in awe of their ideas and concepts.
[19:40:09] <Grinnz> xenu: the ones without documentation are also harder to find and nobody uses them
[19:40:11] <simcop2387> grr, usps is delivering my package.  i wanted it before work was over.
[19:40:12] <Altreus> not just a special shape of comment
[19:40:17] <xenu> and no, ocaml definitely isn't self-documenting, it relies on type interference and other stuff a lot
[19:40:33] <Altreus> nothing is self-documenting
[19:40:43] <Altreus> the concept is nonsense
[19:41:24] <Grinnz> Altreus: as raku discovered, it's important for it to be statically parseable without running the perl code in the file
[19:42:46] <pragma-> I'm sure there are some language designers that will happily jump = in the same category of "special comment" that other languages have for their inline documentation generators.
[19:42:55] <pragma-> s/jump/lump/
[19:42:56] <Altreus> Grinnz: hmm ... and using standard comments for documentation presumably requires you to also check whether the thing that looks like documentation is actually associated with a function ...
[19:43:29] <xenu> i agree that self-documenting code doesn't really exist but still, not all code is equal and explictness makes the code easier to understand
[19:43:43] <Altreus> pragma-: then they would be neglecting an important point, which is that = can *only be* POD and cannot happen to mean something else in other situations

[19:46:50] <pragma-> Going back to "No other languages care about documetnation except Perl and Raku" -- Python has docstrings and pydoc!

[20:01:13] <Grinnz> for the record, i am completely for your tables proposal
[20:01:21] <Grinnz> i guess i never replied to it though
[20:01:32] <pragma-> I agree with neilb's opening paragraph: "Markdown has long since won the battle of simple text-based documentation formats. People, not just developers, are used to writing it in lots of different places. Odds are that developers trying out Perl, coming from other language experience, will be familiar with markdown, and pod will just seem weird."
[20:01:54] <Grinnz> true, but irrelevant
[20:02:07] <xenu> "python has long since won the battle of (...)"
[20:02:08] <Grinnz> pod cannot and should not render markdown
[20:02:30] <Grinnz> you could run a markdown sub-parser whenever you want, but it can't be part of the pod spec
[20:02:54] <xenu> i mean it can but it requires overhauling the whole ecosystem
[20:03:11] <Grinnz> yes, cannot as in it will never happen
[20:03:16] <Grinnz> and i don't want it to
[20:03:39] <pragma-> I'll read these mailing list chains before commenting further.
[20:03:56] <xenu> there will be an awkward period (10-15 years) when local documentation will be completely broken for most people
[20:04:03] <Grinnz> the pod spec is intentionally simplistic, markdown intentionally passes through arbitrary html
[20:04:09] <Grinnz> this cannot be reconciled
[20:04:21] <pragma-> So a subset of markdown, perhaps.
[20:04:48] <Grinnz> like i said on one of those threads, if you want to invent a pod-lite format that looks more like markdown but isn't, i would be in favor of that
[20:04:50] <xenu> i feel the only two reasons why markdown is actually wanted are tables and images which is why i proposed the above
[20:04:51] <Grinnz> but it wouldn't be markdown or pod
[20:04:55] <xenu> but i guess i was wrong
[20:04:59] <pragma-> Yes, I should read this threads before commenting further.
[20:05:04] <pragma-> these
[20:05:55] <Grinnz> xenu: i suspect it's largely "people don't want to learn things and already know markdown"
[20:06:00] <Grinnz> even though people don't really know markdown
[20:06:10] <Altreus> Is there anything POD supports that markdown doesn't? The conversion seems fairly straightforward to me, except those things POD doesn't have
[20:06:16] <pragma-> Yes, I don't think most people are asking for exactly markdown, but rather markdown-compatible.
[20:06:17] <Grinnz> i suspect not many know about it passing through arbitrary html
[20:06:21] <Grinnz> Altreus: section links
[20:06:40] <Grinnz> and module links, but those are at least possible to convert into links to metacpan
[20:06:42] <pragma-> as in this reply: https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2021/11/msg261973.html -- the list markdown syntax can just be syntactic sugar for the =item pod syntax.
[20:06:44] <Grinnz> section links are not

[20:06:53] <Altreus> ah, semantics on the contents of the L
[20:07:45] <ProperNoun> I'd be happy just to have well formatted tables built in but that's not in base markdown either (not that anyone still sticks with base markdown).
[20:07:47] <Altreus> Surely all links can be converted to perldoc or metacpan links
[20:08:00] <Grinnz> pragma-: the problem is always gonna be when someone wants to use a markdown parser for things, which 1) cannot be part of the pod spec because that's ridiculous, 2) allows arbitrary html
[20:08:07] <Altreus> (or not converted)
[20:08:16] <Grinnz> so sure, a markdown-like thing, but not actual markdown
[20:08:24] * pragma- nods.
[20:08:33] <pragma-> I'm happy with markdown-compatible.
[20:08:50] <Grinnz> Altreus: they cannot, because the target of section links is determined by the pod parser that renders the sections that they link to
[20:09:02] <pragma-> Well, perhaps compatible is the wrong word. Markdown-like, indeed.
[20:09:55] <Altreus> But surely all sections worth linking to are either on perldoc.pl or metacpan - the idea being not to get something correct but something not broken
[20:10:13] <Grinnz> ProperNoun: another reason using an actual markdown parser would be more trouble than useful - we'd have to figure out which markdown parser
[20:11:01] <xenu> tbh i think it's a shame that markdown won. it barely has any features and even the most basic parts of the syntax are terrible (images, links)
[20:11:08] <xenu> even bbcode would be an upgrade
[20:11:11] <Grinnz> and the arbitrary html thing i mentioned
[20:11:16] <xenu> yeah
[20:11:17] <Grinnz> bbcode is actually great
[20:11:36] <Grinnz> it's concise, straightforward, secure
[20:11:46] <xenu> i like bbcode but i think it's perceived as too hard for normies
[20:11:59] <Grinnz> i dunno, i think it's just too rare for normies
[20:12:06] <Grinnz> all the normies i've seen interact with it get it right away

[20:18:40] <Grinnz> at least github's does
[20:18:56] <pragma-> the human readable title is secondary and optional, imo. [url] by itself should be a link to the url. [url](title) could optionally show a title.

[21:45:10] <ether> so you have to be aware of what companies use perl, or network with people who can hook you up with those companies and jobs
[21:45:22] <xenu> sed has syntax?
[21:45:38] <xenu> and i don't see how perl's syntax is similar to bash
[21:45:52] <gladys> i guess i shouldve said awk/unix utils
[21:46:01] <ether> most of my career has been in perl at least half the time
[21:46:43] <gladys> It just looks intuitive to me. And i keep seeing people dissing perl and I dont really understand why. Im not a good programmer tho so
[21:46:48] <ether> I've had to work in go, python and ruby a bit lately too, but any new projects I start myself are always in perl
[21:47:38] <LeoNerd> gladys: Mostly from bad experiences or reptuation from years ago
[21:49:08] <gladys> ether: wow thats awesome then. I learned some C and embedded stuff but I was looking into web-dev type stuff and i thought perl looked cool 
[21:49:21] <gladys> but like i said im not a good programmer haha
[21:49:24] <ether> I definitely think it is! :)

[22:18:58] <x5c30> sed most definitely has syntax (sed runs sed scripts, which are ed commands on line-oriented streams). but most just use sed -e 'SCRIPT TEXT' or the implied -e of sed 'SCRIPT TEXT' and most scripts are just a substitution regex.

[22:19:17] <x5c30> but it's quite a bit more powerful than that, and compares to perl's -n and -p (sed also has -n, and normally behaves like -p)

[23:08:43] <Grinnz> olspookishmagus: with the non-ascii text, keep in mind it needs to get decoded from UTF-8 into real unicode codepoints, and the way to do that depends where it comes from

[23:14:20] <Grinnz> there's better ways, but that way is concise and will usually work
[23:14:42] <olspookishmagus> there's always room for improvement

[23:16:50] <olspookishmagus> and the full story is that I'm an avid freeplane (mindmap) user which on some version (past the 1.7.x) does encode characters in this fashion and it renders "grep-ing" against my mindmap files useless so I need an alias to grep against those mindmaps in both ways to achieve the most accurate results
[23:17:18] <Grinnz> nice
[23:17:25] <Grinnz> not nice that it encodes that way, but
[23:18:03] <Grinnz> if it uses lowercase hex, use %x instead of %X
[23:18:15] <olspookishmagus> it's a tradeoff if you want a mindmap node to be "true HTML"
[23:18:36] <olspookishmagus> so you can add formatting, hyperlinks, images, js backdoors, ...
