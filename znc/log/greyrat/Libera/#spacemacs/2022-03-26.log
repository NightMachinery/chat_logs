[01:21:24] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> hi, sometime recently project and file icons in my spacemacs home screen broke. i couldn't find documentation on what's responsible correctly rendering them. i've tried installing some symbol fonts, like `ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-mono` and `ttf-symbols` but it didn't help. any suggestions how to fix this. here's a screenshot

[01:41:25] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> ok, running the `all-the-icons-install-fonts` function fixed it. it'd be great to use fonts packaged for my distro (Arch) though. i guess i should try searching for the fonts added to `~/.local/share/fonts/` in Arch repos

[01:53:48] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> it's hard-coded to use all the icons font
[01:53:56] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> you have to use it.
[01:54:45] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I never thought this would be a problem becauae there are other packages that also require all the icons font.
[01:59:35] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> all-the-icons font doesn't seem to be commonly used on Arch Linux. searching for it in the official repo with `pacman -Ss all-the-icons` gives nothing. only AUR contains an unofficial `ttf-all-the-icons` package. but maybe it's named differently and that's why i'm not finding anything in the official repo

[02:25:57] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I found it very strange why you start searching the package in pacman
[02:26:12] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> why didn't you head to the upstream repository first

[02:29:23] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> it wasn't to complain the icons aren't available pre-packaged (which they are, just not in the main repo). my aim was to show that this: ‚èé  ‚èé > I never thought this would be a problem becauae there are other packages that also require all the icons font. ‚èé  ‚èé doesn't seem to be true [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=623e3b3ac4350025000b76e0]
[02:30:39] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> well if you use the default modeline, spaceline, then one of the faces use all-the-icons font
[02:31:01] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> if you use treemacs, it also needs all-the-icons
[02:35:05] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> i already had found the list of fonts in `all-the-icons.el`, actually, by reading the source (not in the upstream repo though, just searching the definition in emacs). ‚èé  ‚èé generally on the topic, though ‚Äì i do tend to reach for existing packages and not go for stuff directly from upstream, because then i'd have to package it myself to not make a mess out of my system, and it tends to be time

[02:39:34] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> that's weird then, because i do use treemacs. but using it doesn't seem to have triggered `all-the-icons-install-fonts`, because i didn't have a `~/.local/share/fonts` directory previously (i checked prior to running the function)
[02:41:36] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> and the default modeline for that matter
[02:42:21] <FromGitter> <imdoor:ilgt.lv> and treemacs was working fine, btw. all of the icons were showing up as usual. only the home screen icons were broken

[03:12:55] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> so i tried editing it in intellij and there's no syntax highlighting, which bugs the shit out of me
[03:13:36] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> also, anyone know of any resources for setting up org-roam in sm?
[03:16:44] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> you can edit it in vim

[03:31:23] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> the idea of knowledge base is right. but that should be intrinsic in your brain. if you need things to remind you they're related, you don't understand it.
[03:31:51] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> taking notes of things you don't understand is meaningless. this is a common mistake.

[03:42:26] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> taking notes is simply ritualization
[03:45:17] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> taking notes is explaining things to yourself in written form
[03:45:43] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> so is your argument
[03:45:49] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> 1) writing doesn't help you learn
[03:46:01] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> or 2. storing writing doesn't help you remember
[03:48:49] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> active writing requires some critical thinking. but taking notes doesn't
[03:49:03] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> and for 2, it doesn't help
[03:51:14] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> "taking notes" !(necessarily)= passively copying whatever you're reading/hearing
[03:51:22] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> it can mean active writing
[03:51:59] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> but yes, i agree that active writing (summarizing, rephrasing arguments in your own words) is required for learning (and passive note taking is practically useless)
[03:52:55] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> re. 2, you must have incredible storage capabilities
[03:52:58] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> no summarization or rephrasing are also too passive....
[03:53:18] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> so what is active writing?
[03:53:30] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> you're telling me, you literally don't even need a todo list. you never forget anything?
[03:53:47] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> without reference or with bare minimum reference, start to introduce a concert from scratch
[03:53:51] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> that's active
[03:54:18] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> and this coincides with Feynman's technique
[03:55:14] <FromGitter> <goldenAngst> so what's your learning process (specifically)? say you wanted to learn about a new topic (eg. habit formation)?
[03:55:59] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> for example, you should be able to derive any theorems in Euclidean geometry with 5 axioms
[03:56:24] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I do passively take note in limited cases.
[03:56:49] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> For example, when the source material is very hard to access.
[03:57:21] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> but most of time I don't spent cognitive load to remember "facts"
