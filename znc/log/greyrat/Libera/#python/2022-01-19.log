[00:02:34] <elwoodpd> Hello. So I came in here the other day asking about parsing xml. For some reason despite everyones suggestions I used bs4
[00:02:58] <elwoodpd> and now I have an input that it seems to just silently replace with just a generic xml header
[00:03:09] <elwoodpd> and I am a bit stuck as to why
[00:03:12] <elwoodpd> xml validates
[00:03:42] <SnoopJ> bs4 isn't a great choice for XML, it's very much specific to HTML. It's hard to tell what problem you're having from that description, though.

[06:11:00] <ztrawhcse> I seem to be missing something in the type annotations documentation. `f: undefined = []` spits out the obvious NameError, but `def foo(): f: udefined = []; foo()` does not. Why is this so?
[06:14:23] <SnoopJ> ztrawhcse, I believe it's because the second one doesn't get stored anywhere, so it doesn't matter if the name resolves or not. The first one is stored in __annotations__ on the module itself, so the name needs to have a definite value.

[07:33:06] <SnoopJ> apteryx, I don't seem to be receiving it, but I can say that bpaste is a decent site that won't mangle your content.

[16:05:22] <xenialxerus> Hello everyone. Could someone explain me one thing.  If int() is just a class why it's possible to call private methods from it? Like z.__add__(2)
[16:05:58] <bluss> xenialxerus: __add__ is not a private method but a "dunder" method. You shouldn't call it anyway, just use the operator

[18:23:19] <SnoopJ> NoImNotNineVolt, it's a style tool, so it's only useful if you are interested in the style it provides. Some people think it's nice to see imports in a consistent order across a codebase
[18:23:20] <grym> NoImNotNineVolt: i don't think so.  tidy means easy to read, which is useful to me; tangentially about half of my utility i obtain from black and isort is as a syntactic breadcrumb of where i have been in the code opposed to where other people have been :P
[18:23:50] <grym> which i suppose won't apply on the black-from-day-0 projects i have running right now, heh

[22:05:23] <bjs> i really wouldn't touch sys.path unless you really know what you are doing
[22:05:49] <programmar> yea i don't wanna touch that either, it might breaks
[22:06:25] <deniska> "the same package is imported twice under different names" is a fun one among consequences of touching sys.path

[22:07:21] <bjs> programmar: if you want to use relative imports `from .. import child1` etc then this means the children are sub-packages of the parent.  the parent and each child should have __init__.py files and you should not run files inside the packages directly

[22:10:22] <bjs> programmar: Python's import system is one of the most annoying and ugly parts of the language, mostly because it "allows" too much which makes the imports seem fragile.  If you don't know what's happening the imports can seemingly suddenly start or stop working without explanation

[22:11:07] <bjs> programmar: if you edit sys.path then the same "package" could appear on sys.path twice

[22:11:42] *** Joins: beastDiv1 (~beastDivi@user/beastdivision)
[22:12:03] <bjs> it's very easy to add something to sys.path to try "find" a package, and then the package itself imports its own modules in a different way and hits the other entry and suddenly you have two copies of the package in memory with its own sets of variables and functions and data and it's a huge PITA to debug
[22:12:10] <programmar> so like if i append another directory of mine containing a file called "os.py", it can't tell when i run "import os" to import from the standard libs or that one ?
[22:12:30] <bjs> programmar: that's a different issue to the one described above, but yes that also can happen
[22:13:12] <deniska> programmar: the issue I was describing is that both `import foo.bar` and `import bar` may then execute the same foo/bar.py, but then it will be two disctinct modules as far as python is concerned
