[01:40:07] <kish`> hi :)
[02:06:20] <arryana> heya audrey
[02:23:12] <Samian> It's interesting that teachers ask students what they want to be when they grow up but never ask students to explain why their reasons they want to be what they want to be when they grow up are good reasons.
[02:26:51] <Samian> Stating what you want is elementary.  Stating the reasons you want what you want is a little more advances.   Stating the reasons your reasons are good reasons to want what you want is advanced.  To understand this as I do is very advanced.
[02:30:03] <Samian> It's very lonely here at the top of the intellectual ladder. /me gets out his binoculars to look for audrey  and arryana on the ground
[02:31:41] <kish`> heh

[20:39:14] <audrey> Imagine was near the top of the list
[20:39:28] <plank> they had to re-release "Is This It" in the US without this song cuz of 9/11 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkLxi4Tsm2E

[20:39:37] <audrey> But there were lots of others, including some that were not of a political nature at all and whose presence on the blacklist was confusing
[20:39:38] <plank> new york city cops, they aint too smart :P
[20:39:44] <audrey> Such as Walk Like An Egyptian
[20:40:35] <kmh_> audrey,  imagine was banned after 9/11?
[20:40:44] <audrey> Well, de-facto, among others
[20:40:50] <audrey> The infamous ClearChannel memorandum
[20:40:56] <kmh_> i find that hard to believe
[20:41:05] <brigand> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_Channel_memorandum
[20:41:05] <ro-bot-o> [url] Clear Channel memorandum - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[20:41:46] <audrey> Well, it was done the American way, with lots of plausible deniability built in
[20:42:05] <kmh_> lovely another american idiocy i hadn't come across yet
[20:42:13] <kmh_> it's really banned though
[20:42:31] <audrey> Either way, the memorandum had the desired effect; the songs were not played on the radio.
[20:42:40] <brigand> not "really", just "de-facto" and only some time after the attacks
[20:42:41] <kmh_> it's more like murdoch style editorial policy for a corp
[20:42:47] <brigand> ya
[20:42:59] <audrey> Hence why I play them.
[20:43:11] <audrey> A gadfly-style reproach to censorship and jingoism.
[20:43:14] <brigand> nice song, plank
[20:43:44] <kmh_> the list seems rather random at first glance, i which weird brain came up with this

[20:44:19] <kmh_> brigand, well not all broadcasters belong to that network
[20:45:25] <kmh_> this list looks incredibly stupid (and bar of any context knowledge)
[20:46:11] <brigand> the article doesn't say when the memorandum ended. if it was one month can you call it a "ban"?
[20:46:16] <audrey> It was basically something a bunch of high ranking executives put together in a few hours, as I understand it.
[20:47:07] <audrey> They aren¬¥t banned anymore, obviously. I think the de-facto prohibition only lasted a few months.

[20:51:00] <audrey> ¬´A program director from Austin basically repeated Allmon‚Äôs comments verbatim, however, leading to further suspicion of a cover up.
[20:51:00] <audrey> Mark Pollack, author of the original Hits Daily Double item, continued to insist that the memo came from "a significant executive in the Clear Channel chain." But messages left with program directors in other major markets yielded unreturned phone calls, since few likely wanted to endanger their job security by going against the party line.
[20:51:03] <audrey> (End quote.)
[20:53:24] <kmh_> audrey,  well they never were banned strictly speaking, still existence of such a list alone
[20:53:49] <kmh_> audrey,  in fact i find the list reminiscent of the wokemania in cacademia
[20:54:01] <audrey> kmh_, well, that¬¥s the thing, it was effectively a ban despite never being strictly a  ¬´ban¬ª
[20:54:04] <kmh_> mostly braindead top to bottom
[20:54:08] <audrey> It had the effect of being a ban with plausible deniability built into it.
[20:54:22] <audrey> Also, IDK if you¬¥re familiar with how US radio stations operate, but the amount of centralized corporate control is very significant

[20:54:29] <brigand> self-censorship is the worst
[20:54:31] <audrey> to the point where many local stations have little choice in what music they play.
[20:55:47] <brigand> but still, it's also quite american to call something "ban" or "prohibition" just because you have to refrain from listening to some songs on the radio :p

[20:57:16] <audrey> I mean, I consider the ¬´ban¬ª significant, given the US¬¥ former commitment to civil liberties (which has declined in the decades since)
[21:11:26] <audrey> By coincidence, I¬¥m also reading Lady Chatterley¬¥s Lover by DH Lawrence, which was banned in the United States for 30 years following its publication.
[21:12:07] <audrey> And watched Last Tango in Paris recently, which was banned by the Catholic Legion of Decency.

[21:18:08] <brigand> just saw a coverage about byung-chul han, one of the few contemporary german-speaking philosophers https://www.themindfulword.org/2018/byung-chul-han-philosophy/ his nonthings/unthings theory sounds like bs though. as if a vase is worth more than a theatre piece
