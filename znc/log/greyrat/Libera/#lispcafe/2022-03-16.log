[03:45:09] <kakuhen> hence my guess
[03:45:17] <GreaseMonkey> O(n log n) average case for a completely random list, but that particular quicksort implementation is O(n^2) for an already sorted list
[03:45:18] <moon-child> lol 32 bits
[03:46:23] <hayley> Yes, then you pick a random element and you probably won't hit O(n^2). I hit that in a real implementation on generated data, and blew CPython's tiny call stack.
[03:46:46] <semz> bubble sort is used for small arrays so the calling overhead is a larger fraction of the work. clearly fastcall makes sense here :-)

[14:38:59] <selwyn> it is a waste of valuable energy and the central attraction is the possibility of making some $ for free off of some other sucker
[14:39:46] <selwyn> i cannot comment too much on the decentralisation aspects of it, but if it is decentralised, it does not seem like the kind of decentralisation that i would like to see

[14:45:57] <hayley> The "one CPU = one vote" assumption for proof of work was a big mistake, still.
[14:46:22] <nwoob> why
[14:47:38] <hayley> Because there are GPUs. Then there are FPGAs. And if you can make some money from it, custom silicon is also possible (and happened like 10 years ago).
[14:50:44] <selwyn> i am sympathetic to crazy theoretical nonsense that doesn't have any application

[15:09:49] <hayley> The idea of "1 CPU = 1 vote" is central to proof of work in blockchains, and generally defining a "vote" is the cause of much debate (e.g. proof of stake and other models). So it is a fairly fundamental idea IMO.

[15:11:08] <hayley> There isn't really a vote, but the general idea of proof of work is that "a well behaved majority can out-compute an attacker". And I guess with proof of stake, it is rather that a well behaved majority can sign with keys that they use to hold the most coins.

[18:54:21] <gilberth> Hello selwyn, I hear you submitted your thesis. Congratulations! How does it feel to be idle now?
[18:54:30] <selwyn> pretty great
[18:54:43] <selwyn> doing nothing
[18:55:46] <gilberth> Good. I often fall into a post-submitted boredom, when I am done with something of this size.
[18:56:07] <selwyn> i know that feeling
[18:56:16] <selwyn> preempting it with drinking
[18:56:19] <selwyn> in a good way
[18:57:00] <selwyn> i am going away for the weekend with friends
[18:57:06] <selwyn> which will be a real celebration
[18:57:25] <gilberth> That sounds terrific.
[18:58:24] <selwyn> the hard part about academia is that there is never any real closure
[18:58:49] <selwyn> papers always have to be reviewed, theses have to be defended
[18:58:56] <selwyn> your work can always be criticised
[18:58:59] <selwyn> but for now, i can relax
[18:59:29] <gilberth> Sure, but isn't this part of the nature of science?
[19:00:15] <gilberth> I mean that it could always happen that someone comes along and has a different idea.
[19:01:09] <selwyn> it is part of the nature of science
[19:01:13] <selwyn> well
[19:01:47] <selwyn> people having different ideas is a different thing, and not really a problem
[19:02:15] <selwyn> my point is that the whole thing is very stressful
[19:02:21] <selwyn> but right now, it doesn't matter
[19:02:29] <ck_> private enterprise is not unstressfull either
[19:02:32] <ck_> I think life is the problem
[19:02:34] <gilberth> Yes, there is nothing you could do right now.
[19:02:44] <selwyn> private enterprise can enumerate better though
[19:02:55] <ck_> enumerate what?
[19:03:10] <ck_> or is that a term meaning payment
[19:03:29] <selwyn> sorry, emunerate
[19:03:31] <selwyn> lol
[19:03:59] <selwyn>  for (Enumeration<E> e = v.elements(); e.hasMoreElements();)
[19:04:16] * gilberth still doesn't get it.
[19:04:21] <ck_> I don't either
[19:05:08] <selwyn> it seems that the word i was looking for is remunerate, not emunerate
[19:05:11] <selwyn> means to pay money
[19:05:26] <selwyn> enumerate means to iterate over
[19:05:31] <selwyn> this is embarrassing
[19:05:49] <gilberth> Sure, but with an enterprise you could also easily go bankrupt.
[19:06:01] <selwyn> i get that
[19:06:25] <ck_> I think the bad parts of both academia and private enterprise are very similar in many situations
[19:06:28] <gilberth> And usually you don't make any money in the first two or so years after founding.
[19:06:43] <ck_> office politics and so on, for example

[19:10:25] <gilberth> selwyn: In German "enumerate" would almost have made sense. "Zahl" = number, "zählen" = "to count", "aufzählen" = enumerate, "zahlen" = "to pay", "Zahlung" = "payment". :-)

[19:11:30] <ck_> well, I'll raise a guinness to your thesis submission as soon as I'm home, selwyn. preemptive cheers
[19:12:52] <selwyn> sometimes english has agglunative features
[19:14:10] <selwyn> ck: thank you!
[19:22:37] <gilberth> It must be somehow connected to "tale" for "Erzählung" = "tale", "erzählen" = "to tell", which in Low German is "vertellen". There also is "Taller" as a monetary unit. "T[h]aler" = "Zahler" = thing that pays. But I really don't know, could be just coincidence. Which brings me back that older spelling of some words with "th" for "t" must have some significance, I don't get.
[19:22:40] * gilberth shrugs
[19:23:02] <gilberth> s/Taller/Taler/ :/
[19:25:00] <edgar-rft> all words etymologically go back to the neanderthal "Ugh!" :-)

[19:27:03] <selwyn> being an english speaker it is difficult to partake in language family etymology
[19:27:25] <gilberth> How so?
[19:28:28] <selwyn> well, i don't know enough german to comment on the common root of words
[19:28:36] <edgar-rft> since approx. 7000 years england is an isle...
[19:29:10] <selwyn> perhaps 'zahl' and 'tale' have some equivalents in english but i cant say what they are
[19:29:37] <gilberth> Well, English in itself had many influences from different languages. It's not the native language of those island people anymore.
[19:31:08] <ck_> bank teller, story teller, many such cases. But "Teller" in german means plate
[19:31:12] <ck_> well anyway .. you tell 'er
[19:32:28] <gilberth> selwyn: I am guessing. But to my North Germany ear there is a sound shift between "z" [or an s-sound] and "t". Also Low German "dat" = High German "das". So I actually can hear "T[h]aler" as "Zahler" = something to do with "zahlen" in the meaning of paying. Or rather we say "count the money" for paying/payment. But I am only guessing.
[19:33:23] <gilberth> ck_: Yes, but a "Verteller" is a story teller.
[19:33:45] <gilberth> In Low German that is.
[19:33:55] <ck_> or dutch
[19:34:07] <ck_> or afrikaans
[19:34:08] <selwyn> turkish has a similar etymology actually, with the exception that 'number' is not linked to 'payment', only 'count'
[19:34:10] <gilberth> Which is the same thing :-)
[19:35:17] <gilberth> [Though the little Low German I know is very different from Dutch. I can't understand Dutch as fluently as local Low German.]
[19:35:23] <gilberth> selwyn: Interesting.
[19:35:57] <selwyn> it is difficult as an english speaker to access a dialect continuum

[21:53:35] <gilberth> selwyn: Guinness is readily available in Germany. No problem there.
[21:54:09] <selwyn> i remember finding an irish pub in marbella to mild surprise
[21:54:36] <shka> selwyn: what did you expect? that beer shipment got stuck at customs?
[21:54:45] <gilberth> You could also find it at grocery stores.
[21:54:52] <selwyn> i didn't think that irish pubs were popular
[21:55:19] <gilberth> There are here.
[21:57:31] <ck_> no pubs around here, not even an atm. but the supermarket sells guinness
[21:59:08] <ck_> shka: so the UN sent a strongly worded letter, ordering the end of the war.  job done, right?
[21:59:41] <shka> this is not joking matter
[22:00:18] <ck_> you're right, but taking it seriously only leads to despair. what can I do about it

[22:28:00] <ck_> edgar-rft: but I thought the manuscript was the phone, like one says "I'm on the phone"?   maybe we'll never know
[22:29:19] <ck_> I have a question for the 'rft' in you. do you have a favourite kind of toolbox?
[22:30:37] <edgar-rft> once somebody left his phone lying on a chair and suddenly I was accidentaly *on* the phone :-)
[22:30:42] <edgar-rft> toolbox?
[22:31:07] <ck_> toolbox, for carrying and moving tools. in the physical world

[22:33:11] <edgar-rft> old small suitcases usually, they tend to get dirty and damaged pretty quick, so it makes no sense to invest much money
[22:34:24] <ck_> I have one like this and don't like it at all, the handles get in the way and the sheet metal has sharp edges and corners that assault your legs when the thing stands opened

[22:35:52] <edgar-rft> true, that's the shittiest kind of all :-) I often buy old suitcases at ebay for 5 or 10 bucks 
[22:38:22] <gilberth> I used to have a suitcase-like "toolbox" where longish tools like screwdrivers are stuck to the top part. You could put that on table, open it up and have those available without searching. Like this one <https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91xONDfEfHL._AC_SY355_.jpg>
[22:39:28] <ck_> ah, that kind of suitcase.  thanks for the input
[22:42:43] <gilberth> Mine was well organized, the bottom half had pockets or compartments, too. Everything had it place, which is a time saver when out in the field.
[22:43:40] <gilberth> And that field could also be in-house :-)

[22:46:07] <ck_> yeah, absolutely. I'm trying to get organized and have bought some utility boxes, one for electronics repair for example (soldering iron, pry tools and so on). maybe I'll just get rid of that toolbox

[22:48:11] <ck_> "austerity"
[22:49:15] <edgar-rft> gilberth: the medical one or the dirty one?
[22:49:57] <gilberth> Dirty? Why dirty?
[22:50:57] <edgar-rft> the suitcase from the second link looks not really clean
[22:51:11] * gilberth has another look.
[22:51:17] <edgar-rft> but only 1 Euro :-)
[22:52:05] <gilberth> Yep, it also has some dents. Could be mine. :-)
