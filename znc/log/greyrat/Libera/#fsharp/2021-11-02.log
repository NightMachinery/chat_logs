[11:50:04] <MatthiasVance> Do note, the solution is faulty because the takeWhile takes the wrong part still :D
[12:17:39] <biberu> even faulty f# is nice! :D

[16:13:47] <biberu> there is no cake
[16:22:15] <xeno> biberu: did you play the same game I did? The cake was not a lie, that's a false meme 
[16:22:41] <biberu> indomitable: xeno will share his cake with you
[16:24:08] <xeno> I ate mine, then biked it up
[16:24:26] <biberu> indomitable: there is no cake
[16:25:05] <biberu> i actually never played portal
[16:26:58] <biberu> there is no cake here regardless
[16:27:21] <biberu> and if there was you wouldn't be allowed to mutate it indomitable!
[16:28:33] <xeno> you wouldn't mutate it by eating it, you would just create a new universe where the cake is half-eaten by you
[16:30:39] <biberu> does that mean you have to spend calories on creating new universes before you receive those from the cakes? ðŸ¤”
[16:31:27] <biberu> either being a god is easy, or we'll all die trying to get cake
[16:38:34] <stenno\OK> wait is that the hitchhikers guide cake?
[16:38:59] <stenno\OK> xenos cake sounds like an old greek paradox

[16:55:30] <xeno> stenno: you know that zeno's paradox was wrong, right? It was based on bad math 
[16:56:30] <stenno> ...are you really asking me if i know that zenos paradox is wrong?
[16:57:28] <xeno> I was informing you that it was. If you knew that it was, then that's an extra bonus :)
[16:59:05] <stenno> it is obvious that its wrong
[16:59:19] <stenno> i mean if you shoot someone with an arrow they will die, they wont outrun the arrow
[16:59:50] <stenno> or if achilles runs against a tortoise
[17:00:01] <stenno> xeno: did you know that the paradox of epimenidis (sp?) is wrong?
[17:00:08] <stenno> or rather, that its solvable
[17:00:10] <stenno> not wrong
[17:00:23] <stenno> all paradoxes are wrong or else they wouldn't be paradoxes
[17:03:30] <xeno> I'm aware, paradoxes means that one or more of the axioms are wrong 
[17:03:43] <stenno> see maxwell demon too
[17:05:09] *** stenno is now known as stenno\OK
[17:08:03] <xeno> I looked up maxwell's demon. I don't understand the counter-argument
[17:08:05] <biberu> xeno: in other words, paradoxes are not paradoxes, and that is a paradox
[17:12:34] <stenno\OK> the argument against maxwells demon is that you cannot generate energy out of nothing
[17:20:19] <xeno> the argument I read is that "the demon can't know which nolecules are faster without observing them, and observation creates entropy" - and I don't get that, because he can do lucky guesses for free 
[17:23:27] <stenno\OK> i am not an expert in thermodynamics
[17:24:44] <xeno> neither am I, I am incredibly poor at it :) 
[17:24:59] <stenno\OK> but this is a legendary paradoxon and i doubt it can be resolved this easily

[23:26:25] <indomitable> VanceMatthias
[23:41:35] <biberu> MatthiasVance: how about just a seq block that yields chunks to examine?
[23:42:03] <MatthiasVance> Yeah but the chunks need to be examined in reverse order
[23:43:01] <biberu> yeah, set the position to end - size and go towards zero?
[23:46:10] <biberu> using a seq might mean a lot of allocations btw
[23:48:23] <biberu> (since ownership of the chunks leaves the reader)
[23:57:47] <MatthiasVance> Yeah still need to clean things up in that regard
