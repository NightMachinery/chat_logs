[01:05:26] <phogg> dostoyevsky2: ZFS retains, internally, a lot of Solaris APIs. These are then translated to Linux APIs along the edges. That's not the same thing as having a Solaris kernel hosting a Linux kernel, not by half.

[01:06:21] <phogg> dostoyevsky2: there are some bits of Solaris itself which are retained as part of ZFS when it runs in Linux, so as to avoid having to rewrite more things. That's part of the porting layer. That does not mean the Solaris kernel is running in any sense.
[01:06:33] <ayecee> oh, you think it literally means emulating a whole kernel, not emulating the kernel interfaces.

[02:18:52] <Junxter> i run bunch of VM, 20GB system disk on physical hard disk. all work is on separate VM disks on SSD
[02:19:00] <jochum> [[R]]: I'm just curious what is bad with ~/.local/bin in $PATH?
[02:19:16] <[[R]]> jochum: who said there was anything "bad" about that?
[02:19:33] <mrfb> yeah my NAS run on proxmox and various services are separated VMS
[02:19:43] <mrfb> but not for just "browsing" the internet XD
[02:19:43] <jochum> [[R]]: p-i-: you JUST have .local/bin in PATH? how broken is your system... <-- maybe i misread that line?
[02:19:58] <[[R]]> jochum: he said PATH was "/home/ubuntu/.local/bin" not "path contains..."

[02:20:48] <[[R]]> p-i-: whats wrong with it
[02:21:10] <Junxter> 20GB system disks sit on physical disk fully partitioned .   work disks on SSD are dynamic grow as you need with 500GB or 1TB allocation each, all share one underlying SSD

[08:36:38] <flimsypondreed> there's 3x lines with ath11k_pci in the dmesg but it doesn't have anything further, nor errors
[08:36:49] <[[R]]> flimsypondreed: and those 3 lines are...
[08:37:08] <flimsypondreed> sorry it's on my laptop which isn't connected to the internet
[08:37:26] <[[R]]> so you want help
[08:37:29] <[[R]]> but you can't tell us what it says
[08:37:31] <[[R]]> ...
[08:37:48] <mrjpaxton[m]> That's always a good first step. I had Wifi-6/Wireless AD not even show up in Debian 10 stable. A newer kernel like that shouldn't have too much of an issue (hopefully). I'm only more familiar with ath9k and ath10k. Didn't even know there was an ath11k until now.
[08:37:51] <Psi-Jack> mrjpaxton: Sad thing is though. Some people will express that "running a mail server" will ruin your life, you will always be babysitting it.
[08:38:10] <flimsypondreed> well it works on 5.13, I think fixing it is beyond my ability anyway
[08:38:18] <flimsypondreed> I say "works"
[08:38:21] <Psi-Jack> mrjpaxton: For Ceph, while I don't have to babysit it much, when it breaks in wierd ways, like now. It's a ROYAL PITA to get back in order sometimes.
[08:38:29] <Psi-Jack> And can take hours, to days doing it.
[08:38:32] <flimsypondreed> it fails after a few suspends
[08:38:46] <Psi-Jack> Still never lost data to it, but damned if I've lost time.
[08:38:58] <flimsypondreed> I was more interested if anyone had insight into the ath11k drivers
[08:39:16] <TJ-> flimsypondreed: is it missing some firmware file?
[08:39:37] <TJ-> flimsypondreed: the kernel log would usually report that
[08:39:54] <flimsypondreed> as in dmesg?
[08:40:08] <TJ-> flimsypondreed: yes, or "journalctl -k"
[08:40:19] <mrjpaxton[m]> Psi-Jack: I think my problem with that is I always want E-mails sent to me to arrive, especially for my home E-mail, which tends to have important stuff. S0 for that I need to have it be about 100% super reliable and hosted for me. If I'm just experimenting with E-mail, and doing testing with it, I might try to self-host it, or have mail forwarded to it, or use it for more unimportant mail, or even spam testing. I would never want to do that

[08:41:28] <Psi-Jack> And it's always a damn weekend I have ceph issues.
[08:42:22] <TJ-> flimsypondreed: you can check which firmware files the module knows about and then compare that list to what is installed under /lib/firmware/ with "modinfo -F firmware <module_name>"
[08:42:46] <flimsypondreed> TJ-: I can see a line "hci_uart_qca serial0-0: failed to acquire enable gpio"
[08:42:57] <mrjpaxton[m]> Linux support and communities can still be hard to come by now and then. It's hard to expect people to respond to "Fix my problem, now!" for free all the time.
[08:43:04] <flimsypondreed> QCA is the qualcomm identifier for the module I think
[08:43:12] <flimsypondreed> but that's only a warning
[08:43:14] <TJ-> flimsypondreed: that sounds related "QCA" means Qualcomm, which own Atheros

[08:45:40] <TJ-> flimsypondreed: that's an ACPI issue

[08:49:49] <mrjpaxton[m]> In my experience, Bluetooth has always been an issue to get working right on Linux, even moreso than Wi-Fi a few years ago, back in the older days of Linux. So does the Wi-Fi work fine, or is it both the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth coexist that is not working?

I will say, as a last resort, if your Dell XPS [is what it was, right] has a way where you can take out the mini-PCI card, and the BIOS doesn't blacklist Wi-Fi cards, which is a thing, then... You might be able to put a card in there that is Wireless N or Wireless AC instead, both Intel and Atheros are fine. Stay away from Broadcom, MediaTek or anything else unless you know

[10:24:23] <mrjpaxton[m]> I wonder if mhi or ath11k_pci has any useful module parameters (modparam) than can be turned on or off, for debugging?
[10:24:27] <TJ-> flimsypondreed: "man modprobe.d"
[10:24:31] <mrjpaxton[m]> I usually like to check those out.
[10:24:32] <TJ-> mrjpaxton[m]: nope
[10:24:44] <mrjpaxton[m]> Oof.
[10:24:52] <TJ-> the code is pretty bare and basic
[10:25:26] <TJ-> there's good detail on MHI in ./Documentation/mhi/ though
[10:26:05] <flimsypondreed> ahhh now I understand
[10:26:08] <TJ-> "MHI controller driver manages the interaction with the MHI client devices
[10:26:10] <TJ-> such as the external modems and WiFi chipsets. It is also the MHI bus master
[10:26:12] <TJ-> which is in charge of managing the physical link between the host and device.
[10:26:14] <TJ-> It is however not involved in the actual data transfer as the data transfer
[10:26:16] <TJ-> is taken care by the physical bus such as PCIe. Each controller driver exposes
[10:26:18] <TJ-> channels and events based on the client device type.

[10:29:48] <mrjpaxton[m]> The whole MHI feels a bit shady and blackboxed, but do I think I know why. It probably has to do with one big thing: Wi-Fi regulation, and regulatory laws. All companies are afraid, and afraid to be held liable for anyone who misuses their Wi-Fi device. :(

[11:11:16] <mrjpaxton[m]> I have one of those USB 3.0 to SATA connectors from StarTech, and I highly recommend it if you just want to connect an SSD and boot from it just like it's a flash drive.
[11:11:31] <mrjpaxton[m]> I even tested it with ATA Secure Erase, and it works fine with that.
[11:12:09] <mrjpaxton[m]> You can clone from one SSD to another that way, too.
[11:12:17] <mrjpaxton[m]> From a live environment.
[11:12:38] <talismanick> I wonder how hard it'd be to strip the laptop for parts and turn it into a home server booting from the SSD like that...

[12:22:00] <ayecee> that shouldn't give buffer i/o errors though.
[12:22:00] <hexnewbie> In the case with my Samsung, (I suspect) the controller isn't able to handle the bandwidth since the switch to SSD and is throwing I/O errors that cause intermittent slowdowns which can be seen in iostat. So the causes of similar/adjacent symptoms can be in a lot of places.
[12:22:20] <paulcarroty> ayecee: bullshit, trim timer is enables by default almost everywhere

[12:24:13] <colo> jochum, we tracked that informally, but I do not have hard numbers to present. endurance was MUCH higher than advertised by manufacturers in roughly all cases.

[12:25:25] <colo> for instance, one standout thing that I remember: we've had a 120GB OCZ Vertex from 2012 or so that had written tens of petabytes of data during its lifetime.
[12:25:29] <jochum> colo: was not far from Data loose at this time, cause some of them failed at the same time in the same cluster.
[12:26:01] <jochum> colo: what about that Power loose Protection?
[12:26:02] <colo> jochum, yup, that's definitely something you need to take into account. we always distributed drives from the same series across nodes.
[12:26:24] <colo> jochum, not a problem in my experience (power loss in the DC).
[12:26:38] <hexnewbie> Also, some SSDs, especially older ones tended to die on a lot of I/O. Had that Intel SSD that crawled down to a halt on my desktop (100 KB/s, before finally being kicked by MD out of the RAID) two years ago while I was doing Debian 7 → 8 → 9 upgrade consecutively, all while having bitmap enabled (which multiplied the number of writes)
[12:26:53] <jochum> colo: I mean device slowing down when not having Power Loose Protection.

[14:13:24] <esselfe> docker doesn't do cpu emulation
[14:13:27] <luc4> jim: some build systems rely on the arch as returned by uname -a. The fact that x86 is not emulated makes uname return the wrong arch (x86_64 instead of x86).
[14:13:37] <esselfe> you mean run qemu in docker, not sure...

[17:18:02] <lopid> why was it in initramfs in the first place?
[17:19:35] <jnaleg> lopid, I think tumbleweed prefers to ship the open source driver nouveau by default instead of the proprietary. As for the proprietary driver the user has to choose which version is suitable for his graphic card and should be done by the user I think
[17:20:34] <lopid> but at that point the framebuffer or whatever's built into the kernel should be good enough, and only later load whichever driver you want
[17:20:42] <jnaleg> So with the built-in nouveau I could boot into the desktop environment. Downside is that video played back with tearing. Proprietary driver now fixed that
[17:21:29] <jnaleg> Hmm maybe, I do not know if other drivers besides Nouveau can drive an NVIDIA video card
