[03:35:35] <SpeakerToMeat> A kernel module depends on its kernel, but the kernel doesn't depend on a module (other than to use a piece of hardware, access a type of filesystem, or provide some sort of service... mostly. I'm sure there's a few exceptions). It should not produce a non booting system to delete modules unless you delete drivers you DO need to run on your hardware.

[07:31:35] <DagmarX> Otherwise you run into issues where someone finds a minor bug, and fixes it in X of Y places where it exists, where X is not exactly equal to Y.
[07:31:48] <DagmarX> Now you have people thinking this bug is fixed, _yet it remains_
[07:33:16] <DagmarX> I haven't run through the code history but I woudlnt' be suprised to find that's what happened here, but they still should have been reduced to just one single instance of that function

[20:25:26] <rapha> Dagmar: reading http://neil.brown.name/blog/20090817000931 ... says it can be done
[20:25:33] <Dagmar> Like, if you started preparing _now_ and split each disk into two matching LVM volumes, you could raid-1 a pair of those volumes, and prep the other volumes to be a broken raid-5 you could later grow, but ugh.. no
[20:25:37] <rapha> (but not how)
[20:25:42] <ayecee> danieldg: nope, because the parity information is spread between the drives

[23:19:59] <Voidn00b> what would be the recommended way of backing up my running system (emmc) to an sdcard? preferably in a way that I can just dd it back or something like that
[23:20:14] <Dagmar> maret: Apparently version 9 is UEFI only, so if it's not booting check your UEFI configurator and make sure it thinks it's even _allowed_ to boot from USB
[23:20:24] <msiism> Voidn00b: Well, how about dd(1) then?
[23:20:31] <Dagmar> maret: Okay, that verbiage is one of those things that I typically take to mean "I did not actually download the thing"
