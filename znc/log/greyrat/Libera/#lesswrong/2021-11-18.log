[00:00:45] <Robomot> Of Course Fidel Castro is Justin Trudeau’s Dad. Nobody Has ‘Debunked’ Anything | by Karen Leibowitcz | Medium (In the age of sloppy journalism, few authors are sloppier than those who claim they ‘debunked’ the story that Fidel Castro is Justin Trudeau’s biological father. They recite the Canadian governments’…)
[00:01:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, uh
[00:01:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did we lose db0tdan
[00:01:28] <shawwwn> yes
[00:02:43] <gwern> 'Margaret Trudeau was a partier who unquestionably had sex with men while married to Pierre. Nobody knows if Pierre objected. They met when he was 48 and she was 18. They got married when he was 53 and she was 23. Their marriage surprised Canada because Pierre had been a lifelong playboy with no wife or children. He would be turning 60 when she was barely out of her 20’s. She publicly...
[00:02:49] <gwern> ...states today she suffered from bipolar disorder and self-control issues. She smuggled drugs in the Prime Minister’s official government luggage. She sneaked away from official functions to get high. She partied scantily clad at Studio 54. She became embroiled in a scandal for having sex with Ted Kennedy (gross). According to Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, Pierre broke up with her...
[00:02:54] <rmmh> shawwwn: just type ZZ. it's cleaner 
[00:02:55] <gwern> ...while she was having an affair with Ronnie Woods. The list goes on.'
[00:03:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: In case anyone questions you - you don't have to guess, just post on DSL (and @ David Friedman) and ask him what he thinks :)
[00:03:14] <ggreer> heh
[00:03:23] <shawwwn> ZZtop
[00:03:27] <two2thehead> gwern, O_o
[00:03:37] * two2thehead adds that to his to read pile
[00:04:52] <shawwwn> it's sort of strange that everyone knows what having an affair means. but what age did you learn it, and how?
[00:04:53] <catern> where's "a suitable punishment for X is X" from?

[00:05:41] <two2thehead> feep, at least this is more plausible than the "Chancellor Merkel is Hitler's secret daughter" conspiracy
[00:05:46] <catern> as in, "a suitable punishment for [doing bad thing] is [the consequence of bad thing]"
[00:06:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> A suitable punishment for stealing is stealing? Seems false
[00:06:23] <gwern> rmmh: this is pretty entertaining, and a good reminder of how much of the western elite loved castro, if perhaps not in bed
[00:06:31] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: it's only true for certain values of X
[00:06:40] <gwern> 'sure, we'll cover up a trip to cuba because they asked us to'
[00:07:23] <catern> I'm sure gwern instantly recognizes this quote and no-one else will so why even bother pretending I'm asking anyone else, with your low verbal IQs
[00:08:17] <shawwwn> my verbal IQ is firmly above average
[00:08:28] <gwern> catern: it's a common quip. I'm reasonably sure the vim/emacs version is not the original. if there's an ur-quote, I'm not sure what it is.
[00:08:48] <gwern> even if the... bash.org? one is the most famous
[00:08:58] <catern> gwern: oh yeah, the emacs one! that's where I know it from
[00:09:06] <catern> thanks, that's sufficient sourcing for me
[00:09:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> "low verbal IQs"?! Do you even know what my SAT score was
[00:10:21] <shawwwn> around 750
[00:10:33] <gwern> rmmh: anyway, unlike most conspiracy theories, this one would be easy to prove via DNA testing. dude's got 3 kids, after all. odds are excellent they or their grandkids will do 23andme or something at some point, at which point the spanish ancestry will show up in neon red lights
[00:11:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> One of these days you're gonna ask some question about obscure Mac shit and it's gonna be like "<gwern> I dunno" "<everyone else> I dunno" "<Obormot> Ah, of course, elementary, my dear catern"
[00:11:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, really... vim/emacs...
[00:11:48] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: I already asked that! remember I asked that question a couple months ago about ripping files off some old Mac hard drive
[00:11:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh yeah
[00:11:56] <rmmh> gwern: right? and I'm sure finding one of castro's bastards isn't hard either 
[00:12:05] <catern> your answer (that it's difficult) was very useful, thank you Obormot
[00:12:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Well, exactly! Proves my point!
[00:12:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> np :)
[00:12:18] <gwern> ('hey, mom isn't spanish at all. and pierre pere should be like frog, where's all 50%/25% spanish ancestry in me coming from?')
[00:12:54] <gwern> rmmh: well, not difficult in the sense of they can certainly be physically located if you care enough, but difficult in the sense they probably don't have any genomes uploaded already for you to conveniently check relatedness against
[00:14:02] <saturn2> i want everyone to have a backyard nuclear reactor, and i'm not even a libertarian
[00:15:15] <catern> i wanted to build one as a youth but for some reason my parents wouldn't let me

[00:15:51] <shawwwn> use archive.is
[00:15:52] <catern> on the other hand that's probably good because that would have led me to becoming a physics PhD or some other highly impecunious profession
[00:17:09] <shawwwn> impecunious isn't a word
[00:17:31] <shawwwn> apparently it is a word
[00:17:54] <feep> channel low verbal iq strikes again
[00:18:16] <shawwwn> it means feep's family. TIL
[00:18:31] <feep> I see no reason to question this.
[00:18:35] * gwern looks down sadly on the shape rotators who can't even word-rotate 'impecunious' into 'im-pecunious' or see the root 'pecun'
[00:18:51] <feep> I don't know what that root means, is the issue
[00:19:13] <two2thehead> huh "having little or no money."
[00:19:34] <gwern> but then how will you toss off quips like 'pecunia non olet' when you get hired by MANGA?
[00:19:51] <two2thehead> "late 16th century: from in-1 ‘not’ + obsolete pecunious ‘having money, wealthy’ (from Latin pecuniosus, from pecunia ‘money"
[00:20:18] <two2thehead> "Pecuniary first appeared in English in the early 16th century and comes from the Latin word pecunia, which means "money." Both this root and Latin peculium, which means "private property," are related to the Latin noun for cattle, pecus"
[00:20:21] <two2thehead> ah, cattle
[00:20:32] <two2thehead> I knew it had to have a similar root
[00:21:33] <mst> > One lesson here is that if Musk wants to tank Tesla’s stock  by talking constantly for a week about how he’s selling it  he can do it. Why does he want to?
[00:21:45] <mst> won't the tax bill on his options exercise be lower as a result?
[00:23:49] <shawwwn> yes
[00:25:42] <gwern> but isn't he selling way more than he needs to?
[00:26:14] <shawwwn> yes
[00:26:32] <feep> idk, this makes sense to me as a strategy I guess
[00:26:39] <feep> for a meme stock, this contextualizes his selling
[00:26:54] <feep> puts it in a twitter framework
[00:27:23] <gwern> I'm not sure how paying billions extra in tax really helps
[00:27:49] <gwern> let's see, isn't this one of levine's tax laws? "it is usually better to pay taxes later rather than today"
[00:28:10] <gwern> after "it is better to die later than sooner"
[00:28:19] <catern> I guess the phrase I was talking about before is the inverse of "virtue is its own reward"
[00:28:32] <catern> "sin is its own punishment" - very theological

[00:38:20] <shawwwn> sin song

[00:39:40] <shawwwn> it'd be cool if someone figured out how to turn off individuality
[00:39:48] <shawwwn> and to enable collectivism in personalities
[00:41:48] <shawwwn> think of it. we can be like ants
[00:42:15] <shawwwn> and we have a fairly advanced civilization, so there's no reason to invent much more of anything

[00:42:58] <shawwwn> everyone happy to do their jobs
[00:43:00] <gwern> ants do plenty of war and work
[00:43:05] <feep> ants are known for: 1. no war 2. no w- yes
[00:43:35] <feep> traditionally, subsuming your identity into the collective has tended to cause more violence rather than less
[00:43:57] <shawwwn> not if there's one global colony
[00:44:08] <shawwwn> the problem with ants is they're not collective enough

[00:49:22] <ggreer> the jurors are viewing video evidence in the courtroom. one of the jurors asked if courttv would still be recording. the judge said no (and that everyone but the jurors would leave the courtroom after he showed them how to work the TV). a juror then asked (jokingly) "how would you know?"
[00:49:35] <ggreer> they seem pretty concerned about their identities being leaked
[00:50:05] <ggreer> the other option was to bring a laptop up to them but that would be a tiny screen
[00:52:25] <two2thehead> "Political economy is the study of production and trade and their relations with law, custom and government; and with the distribution of national income and wealth. ... Political economy, where it isn't considered a synonym for economics, may refer to very different things."
[00:52:44] <two2thehead> So the intersection between the political system and the economic system. Makes sense
[00:53:09] <rmmh> ggreer: the defense moved for a mistrial because they got a low bitrate version of the drone video 
[00:54:18] <ggreer> yeah I saw. judge basically said he'd consider it once the jury came back with a verdict
[00:54:34] <ggreer> because maybe the point will be moot

[01:16:53] <feepbot> <gwern> https://twitter.com/ollieatnccgroup/status/1460857181906116609 they want to WHAT
[01:20:33] <gwern> it's worth remembering that huxley got a *lot* wrong in that
[01:21:14] <gwern> it's one of those strange works which gets canonized for its insight into the world despite all that insight either being obvious, old, or wrong
[01:23:09] <gwern> the discussions of the Metaverse which keep namechecking _snowcrash_ are similar. the 'metaverse' of snowcrash bears little resemblance to anything that anyone wants, or would design, and was not one of the good parts of _Snowcrash_ or even a novel or interesting imagined online world. any random MUD, practically, did more interesting things than stephenson had the Metaverse do. and yet, it...
[01:23:15] <gwern> ...is practically obligatory to namedrop it
[01:24:06] <gwern> (I mean, I'd like to hear someone who thought BNW was great and has also read _starmaker_ or Bernals explain why they nevertheless think BNW was great futurism and whatnot)
[01:24:54] <feep> I feel like the metaverse makes sense for a setting where you have genuinely pervasive pr, even for like development
[01:25:10] <feep> I imagine visualizing your server processes geometrically is enormously beneficial to spot issues
[01:25:49] <feep> so that gives you a model of addressing things by coordinate, and that gets you a global spatial representation for your network connected resources
[01:26:49] <gwern> but the idea of a big flat plane as the organizing metaphor is... extremely old and obvious. I bet you could find literal saturday morning cartoon "oh no we're trapped in a virtual world" episodes which predate snowcrash and organize it that way
[01:27:14] <feep> I think metaverse is a spherical planet, not a plane, iirc
[01:27:19] <feep> but yes
[01:27:29] <gwern> stephenson just did nothing interesting with the idea at all. pretty much every other idea in snowcrash was more interesting, from deliverators to micronations to the Raft to the sumerian neurolinguistic hacking
[01:27:39] <feep> that's very true.
[01:28:17] <gwern> so it's just one of those weird canonizations. it serves basically as a trope and shorthand. yet we also are supposed to pretend it was at all worthy of canonization instead of basically accidental
[01:28:39] <gwern> we're supposed to pretend BNW was good, and not bad, and nod our heads solemnly. "Ah yes, Fox News. *Just like in BNW*!"
[01:29:09] <feep> hang on actually, bnw?
[01:29:31] <feep> OH, brave new world
[01:29:49] <mst> the metaverse was just a place for stuff to take place in that book tbh
[01:30:06] <mst> it's just that the term took off
[01:30:14] <gwern> mst: right? I doubt even stephenson would ever claim he did anything remotely interesting and is probably pretty annoyed about being constantly asked about it
[01:30:43] <feep> spending time voluntarily in another world with my cyberdeck
[01:30:48] <gwern> "look, guys, it was a perfectly ordinary trope which I used in a standard way as a setting. why don't you ask me about the goddamn inuit or something? you know how many books I had to read about obsidian and kayaks?"
[01:31:19] <mst> feep: needs more teledildonics so I can spend time voluntarily in another world with my cyberdick
[01:31:23] <gwern> "I didn't 'invent' VR. I'm not "the father of the metaverse". I don't know much about it. stop asking"
[01:31:29] <feep> haha
[01:33:57] <gwern> it is, I suspect, part of the whole verbal tilt thing. if it's called 'the metaverse' then it must be super super important who coined the exact words! as opposed to the actual reality of the actual thing or people doing the actual thing just under a different label. there must be some *profound* insight to be found in _snowcrash_ if that's where the word came from
[01:34:29] <mst> gwern: that was, yeah, what I meant about "it's just that the term took off" except you said it more coherently
[01:36:22] <gwern> the belief that linguistic analysis or etymology tells you anything important about anything is perhaps one of the most persistent and more disabling philosophical views. page after page of wasted effort 'X used the word Y, but then Z used it too! And then a century later, A used that word... BUT IN FRENCH??!?!?'
[01:36:57] <ggreer> I can't get mad about it. kinda like how most people don't understand einstein's theory of relativity (special or general). but whatever it got a scientist famous
[01:37:23] <gwern> 'ok, that's a fascinating history on how many different ways there are to say the phrase 'black hole', but look, I just wanted to know, do black holes exist, or not?' 'heck, I dunno'
[01:38:05] <catern> hmm I do that too though
[01:39:20] <catern> I like to research where the words for certain CS concepts come from, mainly because - they often mean something totally different and it's very interesting to see how the concept has evolved over time, and that also gives insight because "everything has been done before"
[01:39:57] <catern> mean something totally different originally
[01:40:13] <ggreer> isn't that true for lots of scientific and technical terms? hell there's a food company named "Soylent"
[01:40:37] <catern> eh well...  soylent isn't a scientific/technical term
[01:40:51] <gwern> yes, but are you (a) entertaining yourself by stamp-collecting and playing a game of _Trivial Pursuit_ or (b) fixing a confused literature by highlighting when people have done connected things but under (unavoidably) misleading names so they sound different?
[01:41:12] <gwern> note that (a) is what Schmidhuber does.
[01:41:17] <catern> I guess I'll claim (b) :)
[01:41:39] <saturn2> isn't this just the usual cognitive miserliness? you substitute the question with one that's easier to answer, unless getting it wrong will cause immediate punishment
[01:42:53] <saturn2> you started out wanting to know the history of VR, but it's much easier to look up who first used the word "metaverse"
[01:43:18] <gwern> 'why trace the actual causal history of influence of ideas when we could solve the easier problem of who first published some idea or other in any form?'

The last time I was in a gay bar, rather than have tasteful gay porn projected on the walls, as in times past, they had videos of high school wrestling. I consider this a step backwards.'
[02:03:18] <feep> so now the real question: what proportion of hetero men are attracted to teen girls
[02:03:22] <adiabatic> ^
[02:07:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Depends on the value of "teen", doesn't it?
[02:07:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does 19 count? Then probably the answer is "almost literally every single one that ever lived"
[02:08:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can lower than and it'll keep being true for a few more integers
[02:08:11] <feep> I mean, if men who look like teen boys count
[02:08:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> That kind of take is always so weird
[02:09:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's like, if you stigmatize people who are attracted to people who look young, then consequently you're stigmatizing people who look young
[02:10:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which... kind of suggests that this is just "ugh, I look old and ugly, how can I convince people that I'm not unattractive, and that people I want to fuck are morally obligated to be attracted to me instead of to hotter, younger people"
[02:10:57] <catern> woah that's a powerful take
[02:11:06] <gwern> it's a fairly common take on feminists
[02:11:22] <gwern> but they never win because as sailer says, there's just too much fraternizing with the enemy
[02:11:40] <catern> sure but i've never heard it as an explanation for why people are opposed to pedophilia
[02:13:28] <gwern> you mean ephebophilia
[02:13:43] <catern> the regulatory capture in the sexual marketplace explanation for anti-ephebophilia, and I guess it would extend to anti-homosexuality etc
[02:13:44] <saturn2> just take a look at the women who accuse men of "grooming" 25-30 year olds

In May 6, 2018, Deutsche Bank AG research put out a note about “the ‘Prisoner's Dilemma’ that Loews had created” 6 : Stakeholders could expect no higher price for shares of BWP than $11.50 unless Loews chose voluntarily to tender at a higher share price (or chose not exercise at all). Given that the probable “best”
[03:20:46] <feepbot> the stakeholders could do seemed to be around $11.50 in August 2017, there seemed to be little incentive to hold onto BWP shares above that price. And so the stock has begun to fall. However, as the stock falls, so too does the 180-average price for which Loews can demand tender. This has engendered a real-time game theory practice known as “the prisoner’s dilemma.” By this
[03:20:46] <feepbot> logic, the stakeholders assume the worst of their fellow stakeholders and aim to sell first in order to arguably . . . get a better price than those who wait. This has created a pile-on where stakeholders are willing to part with their shares below what some might argue is fair value.

[07:12:30] <shawwwn> Why no one talk
[07:13:47] <catern> cuz sleep
[07:14:01] <catern> is this too clickbaity of a title: "Introduction", the most common systems concept you've never heard of
[07:15:01] <catern> I'm quite sure that almost everyone who reads this article will not know what "introduction" is, at least by that name
[07:15:33] <catern> but maybe it's still too arrogant and clickbaity? is it a turn-off?
[07:28:44] <quanticle> What is "introduction"? I presume you're not talking about the opening part of an essay, where the author sets up their thesis
[07:29:44] <gwern> quanticle: see? you've clearly never heard of this common systems concept!
[07:29:51] <catern> it sounds like my title is just clickbaity enough :)
[07:29:59] <catern> quanticle: https://catern.com/introduction.html
[07:30:00] <Robomot> "Introduction", the most common systems concept you've never heard of
[07:30:40] <gwern> is 'introduction' really the most common name for this common concept? sounds more like name resolution or binding
[07:31:28] <gwern> possibly even just 'latebinding'
[07:31:39] <quanticle> The corporate term is an "enterprise service bus"
[07:31:55] <quanticle> Or "service directory"
[07:32:17] <quanticle> Where you talk to the service finder service to find the endpoint of the user lookup service or whatever
[07:32:30] <catern> gwern: there is no common name - note how lots of those examples don't fit into "name resolution"
[07:32:50] <catern> (like the matchmaking or Unix sockets ones)
[07:33:23] <gwern> that sounds like name resolution to me. I want Player 2, which will resolve to 23.78.01.10:2201 or something
[07:33:31] <quanticle> No, not necessarily
[07:33:49] <quanticle> You don't necessarily want "player 2", you want a player with a certain ELO rating and you don't care which one
[07:33:51] <saturn2> you should definitely change the first part of the title to "introducing introduction"
[07:34:07] <gwern> quanticle: ok, so it's a multicast address
[07:34:14] <quanticle> And it's up to the matchmaking service to find a player and send your computer their connection info
[07:34:16] <gwern> or content-based addressing
[07:34:42] <quanticle> I mean, I dunno, that also seems like a stretch. You don't necessarily know the specific content you're requesting, though
[07:34:44] <catern> saturn2: initially it was "An introduction to "introduction": A common but rarely-named systems concept" but that wasn't clickbaity enough. but "Introducing "introduction", the most common systems concept you've never heard of" might be good
[07:34:57] <quanticle> I like "Introducing introduction"
[07:35:06] <catern> (i feel like the extra characters in the title aren't worth the pun though)
[07:35:21] <quanticle> At the very least, turn that comma in the title into a colon
[07:35:28] <quanticle> So that it looks like a proper title
[07:35:59] <quanticle> Get rid of the quotes too. Introduction: The Most Common Systems Concept You've Never Heard Of
[07:36:18] <catern> there is a fairly severe issue with getting rid of the quotes :)
[07:36:44] <quanticle> Nah, that's why you have the colon. :)
[07:36:46] <catern> (which is that it sounds like it's an introduction)
[07:37:26] <quanticle> Also, in the first sentence, I would revise "server" to "service"
[07:37:26] <gwern> quanticle: sure, you definitely don't know the specific content you're requesting. hence stuff like requesting 'the latest version', requiring more indirection
[07:38:13] <quanticle> Like, it's entirely possible for an address service to redirect you to another endpoint on the same server.
[07:38:22] <quanticle> Server/hostname/whatever
[07:38:23] <gwern> remember, every problem in CS can be solved by adding another layer of indirection (although that then causes more problems)

I tried a few browsers (firefox, chrome, IE) and it seems to work...)
[07:41:14] <quanticle> 20
[07:41:42] <quanticle> More than 20 and the browser errors out and tells the user that there are too many redirects
[07:41:57] <catern> gwern: the most important reason why it's not just name resolution is that you might provide more or less arguments than just a string name; e.g. the mosh example doesn't have a name involved, and the Unix socket example might have much more than just a name; but you make a good point that I should have a good example of that
[07:42:00] <quanticle> So I'm sure there's sites out there doing 19
[07:42:40] <gwern> quanticle: hm. I bet there's some way to increase that. I'd bet dollars to donuts that browsers have additional redirect counting logic that their tests don't involve. like http->https might not be counted because it would decrement by 1 across too many things as everyone upgrades

[16:50:09] <PapuaHardyNet> this is probably the best post and comment combination to understand LW simulacra theory 
[16:52:20] <kuudes> Betawolf, over here they allow boosters for at-risk people and >60 people
[16:52:27] <kuudes> there is no mandatory vaccination yet
[16:53:10] <kuudes> but yes, imo it is weird they don't allow some people who want to take vaccine dose to do that
[16:54:40] <kuudes> but indeed those are orthogonal: it is possible to force everyone to take 2 doses and allow no one to get 3 doses and to allow people to be without doses and with 3+ doses
[17:01:09] <kuudes> political decisionmakers have seemed to shy quite much away from mandatory vaccinations, even though this seems to me one of the most clear pieces of law related to this pandemic
[17:01:37] <kuudes> ie it is harder for them to regulate how hcw need to vaccinate themselves etc than to force everyone to be vaccinated
[17:01:54] <kuudes> but they are still doodling with the former and not even talking about the latter
[17:02:18] <kuudes> and covid passport use required indeed de novo laws unlike mandatory vaccinations

[22:26:16] <Robomot> Yelling Stop: Does Linoleic Acid Induce Obesity? A Response to Stephan Guyenet, Part 1 (Introduction   OK folks, into the wayback machine.   In 2010 I stopped eating seed oils, and saw a chronic inflammatory bowel disease re...)

[22:27:56] <capisce^> "There is thus clear and consistent evidence in both animals and humans to think that LA is causative in obesity, given its role as a precursor to the endocannabinoid system that clearly plays a major role in energy homeostasis and thus obesity (Hawkins & Horvath, 2017)."
[22:28:13] <capisce^> "Essentially, we are eating a diet that is giving us the munchies, the effect that marijuana has on those that consume it. And the foods desired under stimulation of the ECS are sugar and starch (Koch, 2001; Simiand et al., 1998). As Stephan pointed out in 2012, that’s largely what we are eating more of (S. Guyenet, 2012)."
[22:28:32] <capisce^> "While it wasn’t the intention of this effort, I also think the evidence for the Food Reward Hypothesis is pretty indisputable. It goes hand-in-hand with the LA hypothesis for obesity, as dietary LA appears to be the primary mechanism behind the process of food reward and hyperpalatibility."
[22:29:41] <capisce^> "Linoleic Acid is a polyunsaturated essential fatty acid found mostly in plant oils."
[22:31:24] <capisce^> also found to a large degree in modern pork and chicken fat, due to the way they're fed
[22:33:21] <two2thehead> "When it comes to sales of electric cars, Norway is in a league of its own. In September, battery-powered electric vehicles accounted for 77.5 percent of all new cars sold. That figure makes Norway a world leader by a long way—leapfrogging over the UK, where 15 percent of new car sales were electric as of October, and the US, where that number is just 2.6 percent."
[22:33:39] <two2thehead> 5.379 million (2020)
[22:33:45] <two2thehead> that explains quite a lot
[22:34:29] <two2thehead> it's easier to convince the civilian population to buy EVs for personal use, if they are around the population of New York City
[22:34:46] <dv^_^> Why?
[22:35:00] <PapuaHardyNet> tiny, easy to create social proof?
[22:35:16] <dv^_^> Why?
[22:35:20] <two2thehead> well, considering the US population is 329.5 million (2020)
[22:35:30] <dv^_^> Can't a bigger population marshal a greater effort?
[22:35:35] <dv^_^> proprotionally
[22:35:39] <two2thehead> sure but it's not the only thing
[22:35:41] <dv^_^> proportionally*
[22:36:06] <two2thehead> it's also population distribution. Compare pop per km for Norway vs pop per km for USA

[22:36:46] <two2thehead> the us has a lot more land per person
[22:36:52] <two2thehead> and that's excluding alaska
[22:37:00] <ggreer> EVs are still scaling up. right now tesla can only make around a million cars per year. easy to make enough cars for norway (5.4 million people). not so much for say... texas (29 million people)
[22:37:09] <ggreer> let alone the US overall

[22:38:41] <two2thehead> alright, I withdraw my pop density comment
[22:38:49] <ggreer> tesla can scale their production by about 50% per year. so it'll take about a decade for them to be able to replace all cars in the US
[22:39:28] <ggreer> (well, to be able to satisfy demand for all new cars sold in the US. obviously they're not going to do that)

[22:40:21] <ggreer> seems very bubbly
[22:40:32] <PapuaHardyNet> isn't that the same for tesla
[22:41:00] <ggreer> no because tesla makes a million cars a year. they barely managed to survive the transition from prototype to mass production

[22:42:37] <kuudes> good for her?
[22:42:38] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, so tesla has begun producing goods of value they promised, therefore their vaulation actually has some link to reality
[22:43:36] <ggreer> yeah they're limited by ability to scale up production. they're building factories like crazy. if you pay cash for a tesla right now, you can't get it delivered for months
[22:43:46] <kuudes> oh, someone should point gideon's story from the bible to her

[23:52:16] <feepbot> <gwern> 'For instance, in 1739, Franklin's printed currency for Pennsylvania deliberately misspelled the state's name. The intent was to set a trap for counterfeiters, who presumably would correct the misspellings in their forgeries. Franklin also made his own inks. He used a mercury sulfide red ink, as well as bone black ink (made from carbonized animal bones)—or at least that's
[23:52:16] <feepbot> what he advertised. His own personal mixed inks seem to have been pure graphite, per Wiescher. X-ray analysis of the British paper copies showed the phosphorus and calcium signatures of bone black ink, but Franklin's original banknotes don't have that signature. The image of a leaf on the back of each bill was also a unique feature—akin to a watermark. The leaves were so detailed
[23:52:16] <feepbot> one could make out the traces of their veins. In the 1960s, historians discovered that Franklin had created the images by making lead casts of actual leaves. Later on, Franklin started introducing slivers of mica (potassium aluminum) into the paper he used to print money, taken from a mound behind his house. That mica had a unique composition, electron microscopy revealed, which
[23:52:21] <feepbot> would have been extremely difficult for forgers to copy. "They didn't have access to his personal pile of ore behind the house," said Wiescher.'
