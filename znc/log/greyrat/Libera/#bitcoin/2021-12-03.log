[00:11:01] <Common> ehh i mean i started with their free software, but have the paid software version now for easy upgrades.... all running on my own hardware
[00:11:29] <Common> dont really get the question if im answering it wrong
[00:12:33] <Common> i didnt compile c-lightning or lnd from source or anything
[00:13:22] <zemzem> No you answered my question, I was not sure if you bought their hardware thats what I was curious about.
[00:13:47] <zemzem> Ive built all my nodes through amazon
[00:14:00] <Common> do you run a mynode implementation?>
[00:14:34] <zemzem> I did for a short while. it is by far the most user-friendly GUI for anything lightning
[00:14:37] <zemzem> IMO
[00:14:48] <Common> have you tried umbrel?
[00:14:59] <Common> im a little upset with mynode only because their support on discord is trash lol
[00:15:05] <Common> im basically just helping people in there as i can
[00:15:15] <zemzem> Thats another good one, great user interface
[00:15:28] <zemzem> Havent worked with it very much however
[00:15:42] <Common> im interested, i want to run a umbrel, it seems streamlined
[00:16:27] <zemzem> I am just not a fan of how both Umbrel and MyNode charge these INSANE prices to have a pre-built node.
[00:16:30] <zemzem> Complete robbery
[00:16:51] <Common> yeah but they do offer free software soo ehhh

[23:09:47] <Guest2369> Well the whole reason the coin exist is to inversely replicate Bitcoin. So when Bitcoin will crash, all coins will too, except mine
[23:10:08] <zemzem> So like a coin that shorts btc?
[23:10:40] <Guest2369> It is a coin that will go up when Bitcoin will crash
[23:11:00] <zemzem> that sounds like exactly what im saying. if thats the only price driver

[23:12:01] <Guest2369> I just need a way to make it go public. I basically already have the website and coin. I need to make an ICO thing and idk how to do it
[23:12:33] <zemzem> you have the website created without knowing the name of the currency?
[23:13:41] <Guest2369> Top also only me can see the site as I haven't chosen the domain
[23:13:49] <Guest2369> Yes*
[23:14:08] <Guest2369> Does anything like that already exists?
[23:14:31] <zemzem> There are tokens on various smart contract platforms that short btc if thats what youre asking
[23:14:35] <zemzem> yes
[23:14:48] <Guest2369> Like what

[23:19:02] <zemzem> what is different between this and what you are trying to build?
[23:19:43] <Guest2369> Well this works on the premises that some people think Bitcoin will succeed and others don't.
[23:19:46] <Guest94> Anybody know why bitcoin core is not currently available for download in the UK ?

[23:20:27] <zemzem> Guest94: what tells you this is the case?
[23:20:32] <Guest2369> This won't continue to pump when the Bitcoin stops to decrease
[23:21:16] <zemzem> Why would yours continue to pump then?
[23:21:22] <zemzem> if it is inversely related to btc
[23:21:57] <Guest94> According to https://bitcoin.org/en/download - downloads to UK IP's are blocked
[23:22:43] <Guest2369> It is inversely related only when there is a big crash. It is not backed by any algorithm. Your leveraged thing is. If no one thinks Bitcoin will go up, your leveraged thing will stop to work
[23:23:10] <zemzem> Guest94: i seem to be able to connect perfectly fine when using a UK based IP using vpn
[23:23:52] <Guest94> Downloading bitcoin core, is blocked, not using it.
[23:24:07] <zemzem> Guest94: yes that is what i am talking about
[23:24:52] <Guest94> I'm just wondering about this - (This software is presently not available for download in the UK, and download links will not work if you are located within the UK.) Taken from the above mentioed page
[23:25:45] <zemzem> have you tried using a vpn/vps
[23:25:56] <zemzem> still, ive never heard of this being an issue
[23:26:49] <Guest94> I've got a copy, its not that i need to download it... just wondering what is going on.

[23:33:28] <as2334> probably related to wright's idiocy?

[23:39:17] <Guest94> Not sure what that could have to do with it, wright might live in the UK but the case is being tried in the US no ?
[23:40:00] <as2334> Guest94 I think there's some sort of 'copyright case' there or something like that?
[23:40:17] <zemzem> as2334: that would make sense
