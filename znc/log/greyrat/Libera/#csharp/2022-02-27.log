[05:16:35] <BtbN> The ISS thing is kinda blown out of proportion I feel.
[05:16:52] <BtbN> That "crashing out of the sky" thing is because all propulsion modules sit on the russian side.
[05:16:59] <xb0o2> Well I'd suggest you might want to do a bit more thinking if your considered viewpoints can be swayed by someone tweeting an image of the company they own a significant share of...
[05:17:35] <BtbN> They're not threathening to make it crash, but "reminding" the US that if they were to leave, nobody could keep correcting the orbit.
[05:17:43] <lz_> it's not swayed, it's a temporary override

[05:17:55] <xb0o2> Same point applies I feel
[05:18:16] <lz_> what more thinking do I need to make if 1/ I noticed it 2/ I have a theory about why it happens
[05:18:20] <BtbN> No, quite literally, if the russians leave the ISS, it can't keep itself in orbit, because they use the Soyuz engines.
[05:18:53] <BtbN> It's not a case of an immediate crash, but its days would be rather numbered then
[05:19:49] <lz_> xb0o2: I'll turn this around: you have a bit of thinking to make if you think you're thinking rationnally. Best thing we can do is observe how we think, not really control it
[05:21:44] <xb0o2> lz_: I mean, to be blunt, I'm not the one reposting Musk's tweets on IRC claiming I "hate him less" because he tweeted one thing that aligns with my current viewpoint on a contentious issue that is bound to benefit him financially.

[05:46:36] <Nasp> Yeah ok those can have a high chance of breaking
[05:46:48] <Nasp> Is'nt it possible to use exception handling
[05:47:48] <Suchiman> Nasp: only so long as the exceptions are handleable, things like StackoverflowException will crash the process
[05:48:20] <Nasp> Yeah ofc but is there really a way to recover from that anyway
[05:48:31] <smallville7123> what about this? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13564872/exceptions-that-cant-be-caught-by-try-catch-block-in-application-code
[05:49:53] *** Joins: Jong (~Jong@2620:10d:c090:400::5:8bc7)
[05:52:14] <Suchiman> Nasp: technically yes, StackOverflowExceptions work by means of guard pages, basically there's a non committed page after the last page of the stack and accessing it will trigger a page fault (basically like an AccessViolation) and then the runtime will inject an exception at the offending location, the runtime could just unwind the stack until it reaches a catch handler and carry on
[05:52:50] <Suchiman> same way how you can catch a NullReferenceException which is just an AccessViolation but for the special address 0
[05:52:54] <Nasp> I would still say SO exception is quite unrecoverable
[05:53:01] <Nasp> Even if you can, then wont it just happen again
[05:54:33] <Suchiman> Nasp: depends on how much the stack had to be unwound for the catch handler to be found, that unwinding might have gotten enough head room to run some error handling logic, if it fails to do so due to another SO, then that will just cause it to throw an exception from the catch, causing it to unwind even more looking for another catch handler
[05:55:03] <smallville7123> there is also native crashes, eg from C++ code
[05:55:52] <Suchiman> smallville7123: anyway, despite theoretical possibilities, nowadays microsoft recommends to use out-of-process plugins if crash resiliency is top priority
[05:56:19] <smallville7123> alright

[06:06:49] <Nasp> I dont have one, but i've never found it an issue

[06:07:55] <Suchiman> well i can actually use a lifehack, go to my boiler and set it to the 35°C setting

[06:14:22] <Nasp> Cold water should always be used for that

[10:05:37] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: I have researched this topic extensively when I installed my Tado thermostat, which allows me to set the hot water temperature. Every official institute in NL says "Keep the temperature at least at 60C to prevent legionella growth"
[10:12:15] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: "A directly heated boiler, or indirectly through a <whatever the main unit is called> is best heated and kept at 65C"
[10:13:00] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: "If the boiler is heated by a heat pump (55C), then according to ISO .. heat weekly to 70C for 5 minutes (or other temps and equivalent duration)"
[10:13:03] <ern> You should never use hot water for anything you consume as human.
[10:13:22] <MatthiasVance> Yeah not from the pipes anyway
[10:13:33] <ern> Well, yeah, cold water heated in a pot is ok, of course.
[10:13:47] <ern> But hot water from the pipes is not "certified" food
[10:13:54] <ern> that is why they have separate taps in UK
[10:14:03] <ern> one for cold and one for warm , opposite sides
[10:14:38] <ern> if the "blender" messes up, there can be leakage from the warm to the cold side, and you get hot water in the cold water tap (in an apartment building)
[10:14:43] <ern> this has happened a few times here
[10:15:33] <ern> Generally, there should be a one way valve at the entrance of cold water, as to not allow this to happen, however, if water is shut off, then turned on "fast" hyudralic schock usually kills the valve
[10:15:50] <ern> and you will only notice it fails when a tap somewhere in the building also fails, allowing hot water to go in to the cold
[10:16:06] <ern> very much C#
[10:19:02] <MatthiasVance> :D
[10:19:23] <ern> This kind of knowledge is... odd to have for someone like me, but I do have it.
[10:19:44] <ern> Like, fixing the plumbing at my teachers apartment
[10:20:01] <ern> every time she filled her bathtub, all neighbours (and her) got hot water for several hours in cold water tap
[11:16:39] <MatthiasVance> Fuck it, I was working with compiler services ... but I will just run dotnet build :D

[19:29:41] <lz_> on some posts I see russians talking with non russians, both saying how they don't want war. I wonder of the internet in some way changes this aspect of war, this wasn't possible a century ago
[19:30:00] <JakeSays> i doubt it
[19:30:14] <lz_> war used to be a proxy and now citizens can actually talk to each other. Maybe there's hope in that
[19:30:42] <JakeSays> the flip side is that the internet is also the greatest propaganda tool ever
[19:34:01] <blezz> I just wish there is no nuclear war :/
[19:35:19] <bomb> no it's just people learned how to act politically correct online
[19:35:40] <JakeSays> i'm just i'm not brianonymous_ over there in the DC nuclear extermination zone
[19:36:04] <lz_> as I'm reading right now, it's highly unlikely BUT it would be highly damaging. So it's rationnal to be afraid
[19:36:47] <bomb> yeah weapons tend to hurt people
[19:37:31] <JakeSays> highly damaging is an understatement
[19:38:22] <lz_> nuking cities hurt a bit more than conventional weapons
[19:39:03] <JakeSays> depends on where you're standing.
[19:39:14] <JakeSays> if you're in the right spot they don't hurt at all
[19:47:12] * Suchiman not sure if JakeSays means because you're getting vaporized too fast or because you're shielded
[19:47:47] <JakeSays> Suchiman: lol both are valid
[19:48:30] <JakeSays> ground zero would definitely be painless
[19:57:30] <bomb> what happens if Russia nukes the North Pole numerous times?
[19:57:48] <lz_> earth starts spinning faster, gravity decreases, we fly into space

[19:58:08] <JakeSays> bomb: things get real wet
[19:58:19] <bomb> yiss
[19:58:22] <lz_> earth gets flattened, the equator gets bigger, gravity decreases, equatorians are sent into space
[19:58:45] <bomb> also viruses and bacteria in the ice set free
[19:58:48] <JakeSays> bomb: and we all starve to death because the ocean will become nuclear wastelands
[19:59:44] <bomb> why would that makes us starve Jake?
[19:59:54] <bomb> we'd just live with more cancer
[20:00:22] <JakeSays> because most (if not all) sea life would die
[20:00:31] <JakeSays> or become inedible
[20:01:25] <JakeSays> also we'd have nuclear rain to look forward to
[20:01:32] <JakeSays> fun times
[20:01:43] <bomb> oh that rain thing
[20:03:26] <bomb> apart from the ethical controversy, it sounds like a cost-effective way to solve the over-population issue

[23:41:39] <bomb> "Russia's readiness to speak without any preconditions, ultimatums, and demands is already a victory for Ukraine." says Ukraine FM
[23:42:10] <JakeSays> it's definitely a big change from, what, yesterday?
[23:42:50] <bomb> nothing changed. it's just another Ukrainian official provoking Putin
[23:43:13] <blezz> bomb then the talked with lukashenko and agreed to speak with the russians in the border of pripyat, but he said he expects nothing
[23:43:17] <JakeSays> russia's stance on preconditions changed

[23:44:21] <bomb> this is going to be disaster. I suspect Ukrainians will act the same during the talks with Russians
[23:44:37] <JakeSays> bomb: why would they act any different?
[23:45:10] <JakeSays> i'd be like "yeah we'll stop fighting as soon as you get out and putin kneels before me and swallows"
[23:45:59] <pandem> you can trust russia as much as trump
[23:46:13] <JakeSays> ^
[23:46:15] <blezz> I trust trump more for some reason
[23:46:27] <blezz> at least he didn't start a war
[23:46:35] <JakeSays> trump isn't as intelligent so he's easier to manipulate
[23:46:47] <bomb> JakeSays you're approaching this as an engineer. if no politician changed their ideas, humanity on earth would be long gone by now
[23:47:00] <JakeSays> blezz: he didn't start a war only because others prevented him from doing it.
[23:47:26] <JakeSays> bomb: ok ok. i'd let him spit

[23:58:17] <bomb> JakeSays let me help you. imagine Puerto Rico wanted to join the Warsaw Pact and install Soviet missile systems, so US of A sent troops
