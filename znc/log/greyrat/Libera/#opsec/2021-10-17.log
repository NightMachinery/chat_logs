[15:34:47] <TheLinuxNerd> tomorrow I'm getting my 2nd and 3rd dose of Pfizer ... through digital jab technology ...
[15:35:44] <TheLinuxNerd> central databases are wonderful, you pay some crack doctor to put you in ... and you're done ... no risk, no side-effects (like last time when I had my 1st dose real life and coughed blood for 2 damn months)

[19:52:08] <gartt> It's a shame the quash link in the title doesn't have transcripts
[21:48:14] <moose> gartt: That percentage is like > 98% or so.
[21:49:03] <moose> I doubt we will get out of the pandemic with vaccination but rather over time selectivity of the mutations will result in something less lethal to humans but more widespread and transmissible, like the flu.
[21:50:59] <moose> I am all for people not wanting to get vaccinated if they don't want to, but not in all job capacities. Like, if you're a doctor, you should be required to get it just like the flu shots, hepatitis series, etc are already mandated.
[21:51:31] <moose> Only if it's FDA approved though, not the EUA stuff. That's not cool if they're like "It's EUA and you must get it to keep a job". I think people should be able to decision-make on the risks of an EUA drug themselves.
[21:51:54] <moose> Or whatever the equivalent in other countries is.
[22:05:52] <gartt> moose: The percentage can be argued, but most of my views revolve around letting businesses decide. If you're a govt employee, then you have less say, and should, since you're being paid tax dollars
[22:07:01] <gartt> I have no problem with mandates by hospitals themselves or any other business - from very restrictive to the opposite. I only dislike forcing a one size fits all mandate from the top down
[22:13:06] <gartt> That way, you're not legally forcing anyone, yet the number of businesses and govt organizations requiring vaccinations, masking, distance between people or other rules limits people enough to cause enough pressure to be vaccinated
[22:13:14] <gartt> Or masked, or whatever measure is in questino
[22:18:22] <moose> I think that anything considered an essential public service (think hospitals, not grocery stores) should mandate vaccination for all employees
[22:18:34] <moose> Just like they do for hepatitis and such
[22:19:06] <moose> But I am good with allowing the rest of businesses out there decide on their own, aye. Like, a grocery store can create its own policy and deal with the outcome of that.
