[00:08:28] <isflavior> Hey, i'm using Terraform to create a ACR in Azure, can i also use it to push the image to the registry?
[00:12:01] <isflavior> My goal is to run a container using an image in the private registry
[00:12:53] <Dus10> use Terraform to push an image?
[00:12:57] <Dus10> not directly, I don't think

[00:13:18] <Dus10> you could use a provisioner, but that doesn't seem great
[00:13:32] <Dus10> you could use Azure Pipelines to do it, though
[00:22:32] <isflavior> right now i'm using the Docker CLI to push the image and a sepate .tf file to create the containter instance
[00:23:00] <isflavior> *separate 
[00:24:06] <isflavior> i also don't know if using Terraform to create a container instance is good practice...
[00:25:58] <rawtaz> isflavior: when you said you used TF to creat an ACR, did you mean a container registry over at azure? i thought they already had those, or do you have to create your own to be able to push your own images up there?

[01:13:02] <Dus10> yeah, I don't think we understand what you're trying to actually do
[01:13:08] <Dus10> Terraform can't create an image
[01:13:13] <Dus10> that is what Packer is for
[01:13:28] <Dus10> or you can just your the Docker CLI in a pipeline to do it
[01:13:44] <Dus10> you can use Terraform to manage the related infrastructure, though
[01:14:08] <Dus10> of you could use a provisioner in Terraform to run the Docker CLI (not a good idea, in my view)
[01:17:25] <isflavior> let me try to explain my use case...

[01:50:16] <isflavior> this is part of a no-code platform, we need to find a solution to easily publish the app on the user cloud account
[01:50:38] <lantech19446> jesus I just got a job description from someone who has clients still using Windows XP I was just like yea i won't work for anyone still using XP it just sets off red flags about their priorities
[01:50:59] <rawtaz> right
[01:52:09] <lantech19446> oh yea they also want to offer someone with 13 years of experience 35-38,000 a year
[01:52:51] <rawtaz> isflavior: are you intending to keep state of their environment/infrastructure? i guess that would be tough considering they might change stuff outside of your tooling. might be better to go more for a fire and forget approach
[01:54:17] <isflavior> no, we just need to start the app and let them go
[01:54:24] <rawtaz> great
[01:55:25] <rawtaz> then perhaps using the cloud platforms' official tooling is a better bet than to use terraform? or can you run terraform stateless?
[01:55:39] <rawtaz> tooling and APIs*
[02:00:58] <isflavior> the problem imo about using the official tooling is that our team will need to learn all of them... we prefer to have a common "language" to speed to these cloud providers
[02:01:41] <rawtaz> sure. well if you can run terraform stateless that might work. but thats obviously only for the infra so you either need some additional providers for the deployment stuff or using something else for that

[02:04:46] <isflavior> rawtaz: this is exactly the point i'm trying to figure out now
[02:05:13] <isflavior> using Terraform for the deployment part doesn't seem right to me
[02:06:53] <isflavior> i was thinking something like: Terraform creates the infra --> Docker CLI build and pushes the image --> Terraform creates the container instance

[02:09:11] <rawtaz> i dont see why you couldnt use terraform to specify that you want a certain image to run in a container?

[02:14:45] <rawtaz> apparently they dont want to learn the various cloud platforms stuff
[02:15:05] <rawtaz> im not sure aobut htat though - even if you use tf youll have to learn the concepts and resources and so on in each provider
[02:15:19] <rawtaz> unless you target kubernetes of course, then itll be more coherent
[02:18:11] *** Quits: murii (~murii@90.95.42.142) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[02:20:05] <isflavior> rawtaz: you right, we do need to learn the concepts, but having an "infrastructure as code script" makes it simple to automate
[02:20:35] <isflavior> and yes kubernetes will be the end goal
[02:24:42] <isflavior> right now i'm only focused on simple monolith apps (one container-one db), for a microservices app i think i will need some way to programmatically generate those scripts
[02:25:56] <rawtaz> well if you really want this cross-platform aspect go for the real thing right away i'd say
[02:26:20] <Joel> rawtaz that's a great question, but, tf isn't designed to be that piece, imho.
[02:26:51] <rawtaz> Joel: im not saying youre wrong. i just mean that if it's a matter of saying "on node X, run image Y"
[02:27:03] <rawtaz> i mean, how is that not a declaration good enough for tf
[02:27:15] <rawtaz> it's a one shot as well, theyre not going to store the state (as i understand it)
[02:27:24] <Joel> rawtaz it could be, he could make them variables that get passed in I suppose.
[02:27:31] <rawtaz> yeah
[02:27:48] <Joel> I'd hate to start at diffs, or decide, if the only thing that's changed is a container version, and let ci/cd automatically plan/apply
[02:27:54] <Joel> stare, not start.
[02:28:01] <rawtaz> we know one thing for sure. whatever they do, it wont be perfect lol. cuz theres never a really perfect answer
[02:29:05] <Joel> so many ways to skin this, and not one of them elegant, unless k8s handles this, I haven't touched k8s with a 10' pole yet.
[02:29:31] <Joel> isflavior are you actually using multiple clouds now, or just one, and multi cloud is a dream?
[02:31:04] <rawtaz> let me ask you something. if you had a small program you wanted to build, e.g. a .go application that you need to `go build` or something, and you wanted to utilize azure for that. what would you use for such an ad-hoc thing such as just firing up something that can `go build` in azure, get the code up there, have it run the build command, then grab the result somehow, and then of course clean up?
[02:31:14] <rawtaz> i mean, no persistent stuff, just one off build runs
[02:31:33] <rawtaz> im thinking also not having to up and down it all, just "run" it
[02:31:42] <rawtaz> hence i feel tf isnt the thing for this use case
[02:31:45] <rawtaz> ansible, maybe..
[02:33:00] <Joel> I have no azure experience :)
[02:33:22] <rawtaz> if we switch to aws then? :)
[02:33:46] <Joel> I wouldn't :) 
[02:33:53] <Joel> I'd do it locally
[02:33:55] <isflavior> rawtaz: the building phase is one of the limitations we have, because this is a no-code platform, we can't just build the app on the user cloud account
[02:34:31] <Joel> rawtaz but if I was building something "deposited" in s3, I'd probably leverage code build.
[02:34:33] <rawtaz> Joel: well thats entirely the point here, not being able to do it locally because its too much resources needed
[02:34:52] <rawtaz> you mean you push the code up to s3 and then run some code build service aws has?
[02:35:32] <rawtaz> isflavior: im not following you there. but i dont even know what the product your users are letting you handle is
[02:35:42] <Joel> rawtaz close, s3 would automatically notify the build service.
[02:37:51] <rawtaz>  ok
[02:38:15] <Joel> I've only (tried unsuccessfully) to use nocode stuff, no idea what it looks like on the backend. 
[02:38:24] <rawtaz> im trying to get to what tooling one would use for such a thing without using specific tooling services for it in the clouds
[02:38:34] <Joel> I would have assumed it was a rules engine, more than compiling customer "code"
[02:38:52] <Joel> rawtaz ci/cd.
[02:38:53] <rawtaz> huh, this? https://www.nocode.tech
[02:39:16] <Joel> yes
[02:39:18] <rawtaz> Joel: yeah but then we're talking software where you configure pipelines etc. im talking about a super basic use case here :)
[02:39:30] <Joel> rawtaz this is #devops, there's nothing simple :)
[02:39:35] <rawtaz> yeah
[02:40:02] <rawtaz> which sucks, that there's such a gap between simple needs and what the "proper" tooling out there can help with. it's like all the stuff we have is for large complex needs
[02:40:09] <Joel> the simplest, use cloud, fire up big computer, build.
[02:40:11] <rawtaz> at least they require a lot of setup and boilerplate
[02:40:23] <rawtaz> yeah but then you do it manually.
[02:40:24] <Joel> but tf isn't designed to set up and tear down in the same run.
[02:40:29] <rawtaz> i think the closest to an answer would be ansible
[02:40:34] <rawtaz> exactly :)
[02:40:37] <Joel> ansible isn't simple
[02:40:39] <Joel> or one off.
[02:41:04] <Joel> it's not "hard", but it's not hey I want to build one go file randomly
[02:41:13] <rawtaz> no it isnt. but with the lack of better suggestions i think that might be the best combo of power to be able to actually do all this as well as being able to do it in one run
[02:41:24] <rawtaz> e.g. it can run some tf stuff, so you could use it for up, build, down
[02:41:37] <rawtaz> yeah i agree. but again, what alternatives are there.
[02:41:38] <Joel> at that point, just ci/cd
[02:41:40] <Joel> same thing
[02:41:42] <rawtaz> possibly stuff like waypoint or similar
[02:41:42] <Joel> different language
[02:41:44] <isflavior> we are building a no-code platform, where anyone using a browser, can register and create a simple business app... currently we only offer an option to run it in our cloud
[02:41:58] <rawtaz> well when you say ci/cd what software are you talking about?
[02:41:59] <Joel> isflavior which cloud are you in now?
[02:42:32] <Joel> rawtaz yes.
[02:42:59] <Joel> rawtaz to expand on yes, bash works fine.
[02:43:09] <rawtaz> so basically you just meant scripting?
[02:43:11] <isflavior> because this is in development stage, only hosted locally 
[02:43:31] <Joel> isflavior start by targeting one cloud. Do not get hung up in multi cloud.
[02:43:58] <Joel> prove you have a viable product first.
[02:44:19] <Joel> go multi region in a single cloud after you have a viable product, then go multi cloud.
[02:44:41] <Joel> Terraform is a great tool to use to start.
[02:44:55] <Joel> devops/sre is not a one tool fits all career
[02:44:56] <isflavior> Joel: thats way beyond my role to decide 
[02:44:59] <rawtaz> isflavior: yeah i dont get why you need to support multiple clouds at all frankly. whats the point in that? people turn to you to create stuff when they apparently dont have much skills for the rest of the stuff themselves. so why cant you just decide where it runs? i mean if they turn to you to create apps without coding, why on earth would they have a preference or need for a specific cloud provider?
[02:45:29] <Joel> isflavior if you can't influence decisions above you, you'll never move up the ladder *shrug*
[02:48:21] <Joel> rawtaz people believe multiple clouds avoids vendor lock in
[02:48:35] <isflavior> to influence decisions people need to have good arguments, just saying "its too complicated" will not be a valid point
[02:48:36] <Joel> it ends up being a giant pita for almost no additional value
[02:48:59] <rawtaz> lol
[02:49:18] <Joel> isflavior good luck.
[02:49:33] <rawtaz> isflavior: start simple.
[02:49:40] <Joel> might want to look up the definition of minimal viable product.
[02:50:37] <Joel> rawtaz if you want to discuss vendor lock in by the way, look at all these no code tools
[02:50:39] <Joel> such a joke
[02:50:45] <rawtaz> isflavior: but if you really want to do what you asked about, just go ahead and start prototyping.
[02:50:58] <slaughter> "it's too complicated" should be a very very very valid point
[02:51:09] <rawtaz> Joel: yeah im all with you. i cant stand vendor lock in
[02:51:10] <Joel> slaughter 100
[02:51:33] <slaughter> However complicated it is to build, bad enough. Maintaining something that complicated? Whew yeah that's a HUGE consideration
[02:52:05] <isflavior> i'm 100% with you guys
[02:52:38] <slaughter> "It's too complicated. If you want one cloud provider it'll take us 3 months to build and we'll need 2 people to maintain it. If you want another cloud provider, add 3 more months and at least one more person. Third cloud provider? We'll build it shittily in a year and need 9 FTE to keep it going"
[02:55:10] <isflavior> devops by it self is not an easy job... imagine having to design a solution that supports deploying monolithic and microservices apps to someone else's provider
[02:56:02] <Joel> I don't find it to be hard, honestly.
[02:56:09] <Joel> Though I have a decade of experience, so I'm bias.
[02:56:43] <isflavior> i'm kind new to devops
[02:56:52] <Joel> I can tell :)
[02:58:58] <isflavior> one of my problems is that i don't know the system i'm deploying... it can be a full ERP system (that needs to scale) or it can be a simple hello-world
[02:59:13] <Joel> That's trivial, imho.
[02:59:18] <Joel> That's what auto scaling is for.
[03:00:08] <Joel> Don't know about gcp/azure, but that's about a half hour of work in aws, pick which stats you want to scale on, and make a couple of rules.
[03:00:30] <Joel> some combo of requests/cpu/memory
[03:01:00] <isflavior> half hour of work in aws? really?
[03:01:33] <rawtaz> yeah after you spent two weeks finding the right service to use..
[03:02:15] <Joel> Really. That's it.
[03:02:40] <isflavior> Joel: and you have a decade of experience... i'm here with the task of making all of that happen with a click on a button for our users
[03:02:43] <rawtaz> what is it now, 180+ services? last time i checked it was i think 178
[03:03:20] <Joel> isflavior your customers shouldn't have to click a button to scale.
[03:03:30] <Joel> you should handle that for them, automatically, with rules.
[03:04:16] <isflavior> i'm not talking about the scale part, i'm talking abou setting all of those rules
[03:04:39] <Joel> Ok, it's impossibly hard, you should give up :)
[03:04:42] <Joel> is that better?
[03:05:17] <Joel> Also, since you think it's hard, how about doing it across azure, and gcp, and aws?
[03:05:50] <slaughter> Who TF asks someone new to the game to do a multi-cloud deployment anyway?
[03:05:59] <Joel> slaughter no one I would work for :)
[03:06:23] <slaughter> "Hey I know you just picked up C but I need you to write me an OS"
[03:06:26] <Joel> isflavior maybe I'm reading the room wrong, but you seem more combative, then learning the ropes.
[03:07:14] <Joel> my advice: pick a single cloud provider. get some training asap, with whatever works best for you, lecture, or hands on.
[03:09:04] <Joel> day to day running, I'd focus on scaling and monitoring
[03:09:14] <Joel> deployment I'd focus on repeatability and speed
[03:10:00] <Joel> as rawtaz has pointed out trying to bash aws, there is no singular tool, you're in the deep end, you're going to have to paddle around.

[18:42:12] <kwilczynski> shad: It's like Cloudflare, ish.
[18:42:15] <kwilczynski> shad: Why?
[18:58:19] <shad> got a client that wants our edge device to authenticate to that
[18:58:34] <shad> kwilczynski: thing is, they use like browser redirect captive portal to pass credentials
[18:58:45] <shad> and all I have is a ssh shell to our device, no X server whatsoever
[18:58:54] <shad> no idea how to authenticate my device in their network

[19:55:07] <Joel> shad tunnel ssh
[20:03:26] <shad> Joel: i have (unstable) LTE connectivity to ssh in my device, now i need to get the ethernet interface working, which is plugged by their guys in their network
[20:04:07] <shad> and their network wont let me access internet via the ethernet interface unless I authenticate, which I have no idea how to
[20:04:25] <shad> because a captive portal redirect in a SSH terminal is somewhat complicated to trigger
