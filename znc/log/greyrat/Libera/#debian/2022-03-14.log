[00:23:02] <nickgaw> I installed what was in debian but there is no direct debian package list which there should be or a meta package that pulls in all of the required packages for building android.
[00:24:28] <Khepra> nickgaw: what exactly are you talking about? android sdk? anbox?  because android is an operating system. you can't install it "on debian"
[00:24:57] <nickgaw> building the android open source project on debian
[00:25:29] <Khepra> what's the "android open source project"?
[00:26:05] <nickgaw> the android source code
[00:26:30] <nickgaw> I am trying to compile it on debian but it keeps blowing up with lots of errors about libraries not found.

[00:32:23] <nickgaw> Is there a way to providde feedback about this to google android developers?

[00:34:10] <Khepra> nickgaw: then again, you can also start with an ubuntu container/namespace on debian, and build it there
[00:34:39] <f-a> thanks tris

[08:11:07] <jaggz> sussudio, yeah.  I got the system working at the time -- software that compiles and uses the gpus and cuda
[08:11:22] <jaggz> recently i returned to neural net stuff and found tensorflow doesn't show anything
[08:12:45] <jaggz> sussudio, how does its stuck status relate to python/tensorflow not recognizing the gpus when other things do?
[08:13:10] <sussudio> jaggz: because there's a 470 that's stuck too.
[08:13:42] <sussudio> https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/nvidia-graphics-drivers-tesla-460
[08:14:19] <sussudio> and still the security issues that prevent it from getting out of unstable
[08:15:02] <jaggz> i wonder if 470 introduces incompatibilities with these older gpus
[08:16:32] <jaggz> (like, nvidia-detect says the k80 is "only" supported up to the 318 legacy drivers, then says "it's also supported" by the tesla 440 and tesla 418 drivers
[08:17:06] <sussudio> you would have to ask whoever (doesn't) maintain these packages.

[08:17:26] <jaggz> it concludes with "It is recommended to install the nvidia-legacy-390xx-driver"
[08:17:44] <jaggz> or someone familiar with tensorflow and its demands
[08:17:54] <jaggz> since the stuff is working with other compiled software
[08:18:09] <jaggz> it *might* not be an actual driver limitation
[08:18:30] <jaggz> but maybe it's time to write to the package maintainers for this thing

[10:12:20] <jaggz> somiaj, they were supported, but had to check the docs from the .debs to see the cards' support
[10:12:52] <jaggz> was able to go to 460 that way, and got that instant-ngp project from nvidia to work
[10:13:06] <jaggz> and then found my normal neural stuff didn't work a couple days ago :/ (tensorflow)
[10:13:25] <jaggz> haven't been able to figure out why, since cuda stuff is working fine in other things
[10:15:58] <somiaj> Yea, you may find aksing nvidia directly could help. With non-free there is only so much debian can do. It is provided using nvidia non-free blobs by debian in a way that is compadable with debian is all. Support is up tot hem.

[17:44:50] <riot> it's just 1 meager gigabyte. Completely useless. Shouldn't at least 1xRAM-size be the sane default? I mean, how do you hibernate something with 1 GB swap??
[17:45:16] <greycat> Most people don't hibernate.  Because most people aren't installing on laptops.
[17:45:21] <PerfDave> riot: Is that automated FDE with LVM? In my experience it tends to default to 2x RAM
[17:45:22] <Khepra> 1GB swap is actually reasonable default. 1xRAM would definitely not be reasonable
[17:45:37] <riot> changing the size is nearly impossible, so the auto-partitioning is still completely useless. I had this problem 15 years ago, it still persists.
[17:45:48] <PerfDave> That of course depends on your definition of "reasonable" and your opinion on swap :)
[17:45:52] <PerfDave> riot: Did you file a bug? ;)
[17:46:00] <Khepra> 2x RAM is even worse. modern laptops normally come with 8 or 16GB, that'd be terribad
[17:46:52] <PerfDave> But 32GB of SSD space is a very small amount compared to what you get on a modern laptop
[17:47:31] <riot> a lot of people (yea, i'm in a hackerspace bubble, agreed..) in my vicinity do hibernate their machines. And yeah, if you clean up before hibernating, you might be able to do so with less than 1xRAM, but with 1 GB? there's no chance i can cram a running x-environment in there..
[17:47:54] <greycat> so make the partition larger
[17:48:04] <riot> PerfDave: exactly! The DI feels like hdd drives are at most 40 GB in size..
[17:48:25] <Khepra> it's more than 10% on 256GB nvme laptops, which happen to be norm these days on the low-to-mid end
[17:48:41] <riot> greycat: that's the problem! Try changing that.. you can only manually set up all the lvm-stuff, which is... _inconvenient_ - why not ask for the desired swap-size and then do the automatic stuff?
[17:49:15] <riot> alternatively, i'll have to boot from a live system, open the crypto, resize shit and sew it together again... unnecessary hassle, imho.

[17:51:43] <riot> i can't begin to imagine how hard it must be to actually add that (expert?!) option to ask the user for a desired swap size .. probably years of work. Definitely not less than the combined time of users having to manually partition a cryptdisk+lvm setup.
[17:51:55] <Khepra> can you even hibernate with encrypted swap?
[17:52:08] <riot> sure.
[17:52:38] <Khepra> and does the installer use a separate swap partition, or is it a LV?
[17:52:41] <riot> caveat - not sure, might have to go to a separate encrypted swap, i haven't tried that.
[17:53:08] <riot> what i see here right now, it's all in one lvm
[17:53:14] <Khepra> I haven't used hibernation in almost a decade, so I don't know the level of support for it today
[17:53:19] <riot> with two lv's - root and swap
[17:54:34] <Khepra> riot: the automatic partitioner is basically intended for the folks that don't know how to partition it and then there's some sensible default. the assumption is, any specific case can be resolved through manual partitioning.

[17:59:12] <riot> also, i *hate* manually partitioning lvm+crypto, it is (because of obvious and very much unchangeable reasons) extremely fault-intolerant
[18:00:11] <riot> and often this only becomes apparent when actually booting the installation for the first time, when you'll quickly notice: aw, crap, i've done a mistake, i can do this all _again_
[18:00:50] <riot> mmh, bugs.d.o gives me a 500 on pkgreport for debian-installer ;D
[18:01:33] <PerfDave> riot: Thing is, when you do automated LVM + FDE partitioning, it asks how much of the VG you want to use for partitioning. If you set that to something below 100%, you create free space that you can use for swap. Not a "fix" but a workaround, all you need to do is delete the 1GB swap partition and add a new one.
[18:02:08] <riot> hmm - that is indeed a good pointer..!
[18:02:31] <PerfDave> I was just trying to reproduce your issue in a VM and saw the other prompt.
[18:02:37] <jelly> riot, d-i partman is very inflexible in some cases.  At $work we replaced it with a small shell script.
[18:02:54] <riot> alternatively (i'm not sure) i should be able to resize that with gparted once i open the crypt volume

[18:14:35] <riot> I'll also have a good look at partman, i think. I'm more software engineer than admin, and while you're right - that i could automate that - i think a fix would benefit more users than just the ones i now and then help getting a debian to replace windows.
[18:15:31] <riot> another plot-twist is that i'm looking into nixops right now.. but as freelance, i still have a mostly-debian-customerbase ;)
[18:16:09] <Khepra> something tells me that wasn't a typo....

[18:22:38] <PerfDave> riot: I'm not using expert mode. I go "Guided - use entire disk and set up encrypted LVM", then select my disk device, then "all files in one partition". After the encryption passphrase, it asks me for the "amount of volume group to use for guided partitioning", which defaults to all of it. If I set it to say 80% I end up with free space in the VG that I can use to resize or create more swap.

[22:58:28] <b1ack0p> hi
[22:58:48] <b1ack0p> on my old core2duo laptop debian is assigning only 1gb of swap
[22:58:53] <b1ack0p> but it has 8gb ddr2 ram
[22:58:58] <b1ack0p> does it make difference?
[23:00:32] <somiaj> what do you mean by assiging 1gb of swap? Are you talking about the installer?
[23:00:49] <b1ack0p> if i use guided partitioning in the installer
[23:00:50] <b1ack0p> yes
[23:00:56] <kjetilho> b1ack0p: you only need more swap if you want to be able to hibernate to disk
[23:01:17] *** Quits: zzzzz28 (~zzzzz28@user/zzzzz28) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:01:41] <greycat> this is at least the second person today complaining that the default automatic partitioning isn't what they wanted
[23:01:41] <somiaj> b1ack0p: it is hard to guess how much swap a person will need, since so much depends on what you do. I think it just defaults to 1gig and lets the user adjust as needed
[23:02:05] <jelly> 1GB swap is very reasonable
[23:02:30] <jelly> in fact I am kind of surprised the defaults are sane these days
[23:02:31] <greycat> blackroot: just out of curiosity, are you also a laptop user concerned about hibernating?  Are you also a Full Disk Encryption user?
[23:02:34] <b1ack0p> ok edited manually
[23:02:50] <b1ack0p> jelly: well afaik it should be at least same with ram size
[23:03:16] * jelly gives greycat a number 1 "one" instead of lowercase L

[23:03:47] <b1ack0p> i wont bother myself for full disk encryption..
[23:04:09] <somiaj> b1ack0p: not everyone hibernates their machines and servers and the likes with 100 of gigs of ram, that swap would be a bit too big
[23:04:24] <b1ack0p> i see
[23:04:29] <greycat> the previous person with this complaint was, and they claimed that it was too much effort to set the swap partition size manually because it meant they also had to set up FDE manually
[23:05:07] <jelly> !be a partitioning barbie
[23:05:07] <dpkg> Aww, partitioning is HARD! Let's go shopping, jelly

[23:05:57] <jelly> and it's bullshit.  you use a whole PV as crypto layer, and then slice it into LVs, one of which might be swap
[23:06:34] <nickgaw> If I add a key file to my luks encryption slot and put it on the /boot unencryptioned partition will my system then automatically boot with no passphrase?

[23:09:14] <jelly> nickgaw, if you put the key file path in crypttab, maybe, but I never tried it.  Would you then put your /boot onto a removable usb stick or what?
[23:10:45] <nickgaw> No put the key file on /boot partition that is on my main hard drive as I want a method for me to reboot the system and not have to bother with a passphrase for times when I want to reboot this system remotely.

[23:12:44] <nickgaw> Yes that is a good point but as I am totally blind and am not sure how long to wait before entering in the passphrase I would at least like a method to automatically unlock the system when I want to.  If I just wait at the boot prompt does that prompt timeout to enter in the passphrase?

[23:15:04] *** Quits: zzzzz28 (~zzzzz28@user/zzzzz28) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:15:11] <jelly> grub has a timeout to continue booting; the LUKS prompt inside initramfs does NOT have a timeout, I think
[23:15:42] <jelly> so the machine prompts for that passphrase forever
[23:15:42] <nickgaw> Lets say I enter in the passphrase wrong what will happen and will it wipe my data?
[23:15:51] <jelly> delay, then it asks again
[23:16:41] <nickgaw> Can the initramfs connect to a wireless network before the ssh server starts?
[23:16:48] <jelly> the delays get longer progressively.  You can configure it to wipe itself but that's very easy to abuse

[23:21:09] <nickgaw> I was not planning on doing that so the automatic default installation encryption won't do anything if I enter it in wrongly I will just have to reboot and try again right?
[23:21:18] <jelly> right
[23:21:47] <jelly> and you have a couple tries before you need to reboot
[23:22:12] <nickgaw> Lets say someone does get access to this system and if they don't have the correct passphrase how long would it take them to crack it if it is using luks version 2?
