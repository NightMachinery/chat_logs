[00:02:21] <maerwald> fendor[m]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10179114/execute-powershell-script-from-node-js
[00:02:33] <maerwald> if you want to go down that path...
[00:03:28] <fendor[m]> the path being eternal pain?
[00:03:59] <maerwald> well... you can run the powershell script just fine in headless CI too
[00:04:06] <maerwald> that's what github does
[00:04:10] <fendor[m]> nah, thanks, I'd like to keep my sanity (or at least, only losing it in dont starve together)
[00:04:43] <maerwald> https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/guide/#continuous-integration
[00:04:53] <fendor[m]> with what purpose? Installing msys automatically?
[00:05:09] <maerwald> the problems I see here are: 1. it takes *very* long on windows and 2. it will be hard to print useful info on failure
[00:05:19] <maerwald> yes
[00:05:53] <maerwald> msys2 installation maybe takes 2-3 times as  long as GHC
[00:06:03] <maerwald> and if you abort somewhere in the middle, yeah...
[00:07:16] <fendor[m]> I don't think that's worth the hassle. Requiring only one already installed binary is a huge improvement compared what it was before. Maybe in the future, windows 11 makes it easier somehow, then we can start thinking about it again
[00:07:50] <maerwald> that's what https://gitlab.haskell.org/haskell/ghcup-hs/-/issues/312 is for
[00:09:00] <fendor[m]> hm, then you would have again the issue between completely isolated and self-managed ghcup, no?
[00:09:10] <maerwald> no
[00:09:30] <fendor[m]> would you automatically install ghcup into the PATH?
[00:09:57] <maerwald> self-managed just means the ghcup base dir is internal to vscode... it doesn't matter where the ghcup binary itself is
[00:10:52] <maerwald> on windows I will just dump wherever I want
[00:10:56] <maerwald> users don't mind xD
[00:12:09] <maerwald> the main blocker for MS store again is msys2
[00:12:45] <maerwald> one solution would be to do it like stack... so let ghcup (the binary) install msys2
[00:12:50] <maerwald> but that's really bad
[00:14:40] <fendor[m]> yeah, I dont like the thought of it either...
[00:36:16] <maerwald> fendor[m]: internal-ghcup could be removed even... you can already use haskell.serverEnvironment to set GHCUP_INSTALL_BASE_PREFIX=/something
[00:36:27] <maerwald> and then get the same behavior
[00:40:05] <fendor[m]> yeah indeed, that sounds in general like a good solution. We would just need to come up with a good default behaviour
