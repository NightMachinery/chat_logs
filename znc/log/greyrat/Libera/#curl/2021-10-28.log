[11:31:36] <markand> hey there!
[11:31:42] <bagder> o/
[11:32:14] <markand> I'm trying to use curl_multi_fdset + curl_multi_perform with my own select() loop, it works correctly but the problem is that I'm unable to detect an abnormal disconnection 
[11:32:28] <markand> the problem is that I'm reading a page that never ends (a stream of content from a RFID reader)
[11:32:46] <markand> and I would like to detect if the reader got disconnected/powered off
[11:33:33] <markand> using CURLOPT_TIMEOUT isn't an option either since I may not receive data from the reader for long periods as well
[11:34:31] <bagder> markand: do you have tcp keepalive enabled?
[11:35:00] <markand> as a curl option or on the reader?
[11:35:33] <markand> you mean CURLOPT_TC_KEEPALIVE?
[11:39:34] <markand> oh, just setting CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE indeed seems to work!

[11:45:00] <markand> hmm no it actually doesn't if I unplug the ethernet cable from the RFID reader
[11:45:53] <bagder> why not? then the TCP surely shouldn't remain alive?
[11:47:55] <markand> I'm not sure to understand what do you mean
[11:49:05] <bagder> the problem is that TCP generally is silent when there's no traffic, so when the other end just vanishes, curl can't detect that. It looks like a silent peer. The best to detect this is by tcp keepalive
[11:50:03] <markand> I've enabled it using CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE and I've even put short timeout using CURLOPT_TCP_KEEP(INTVL|IDLE) to 5s 
[11:51:23] <markand> but after unplugging the cable the loop with curl_multi_perform still returns 0 and set running_handles to 1
[11:56:39] <bagder> how long did you wait to see any effect? what platform are you running this on?
[11:56:43] <icing> if you want to debug tcp, take wireshark and monitor what is really going on in the connection
[11:56:54] <bagder> sound advice ^^
[11:57:14] <markand> 5 minutes now :P
[11:57:26] <markand> I'm running on Linux (glibc)
[12:03:27] <bagder> but yeah, verify with wireshark that the connection is visible closed as then curl should notice

[12:44:36] <bagder> I count 11991 commits since then =)
[12:45:12] <icing> maybe you should have made better 7.29.0 versions instead of these new ones.
[12:46:18] <icing> I think we should declare every commit as fixing a severe security hole - so that it gets backported to LTS release lines.
[12:47:37] <bagder> 7.29.0 + the 11991 most important commits

[13:12:08] <bagder> with a fresh reference to "WebKit WinCairo" using libcurl 
[13:12:58] <icing> well, it is an encoding...
[13:13:20] * zelest encodes icing 
[13:13:51] <icing> 'aWNpbmcK' is my base64 nick!

[13:17:58] <bagder> wohoo
[13:18:14] <zelest> now I have to play the waiting game until december when the car arrives
[13:18:33] * icing will be extra careful when crossing the road
[13:18:45] <bagder> I've done a lot of driving with my daughter lately who's in the process of learning
[13:18:55] <zelest> icing, avoid the center part of Sweden for a year or two :)
[13:19:03] <zelest> bagder, nice!
[13:19:20] <zelest> to clarify, I'm 38.. so it took me 20 years to get it done :P
[13:19:30] <zelest> but better late than never
[13:19:33] <bagder> =)
[13:20:14] <icing> nice. so you have some years to practise before loss of vision and hearing makes it more difficult with age!
[13:21:06] <zelest> haha, mhm, by that time, the cars drive themselfs... I hope
[13:22:18] <icing> we are all waiting for bagder to add that to curl, so it becomes available in all cars.
[13:22:50] <bagder> shouldn't be too hard, should it?
[13:23:08] <zelest> I'm pretty sure my car ships with curl :)
[13:23:17] <bagder> many do!
[13:23:35] <zelest> https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/08/12/a-hundred-million-cars-run-curl/
[13:23:41] <zelest> according to your post, it does! :)
[13:24:46] <zelest> Will be amazingly fun to pentest the car as well
[13:24:53] <zelest> Hunt some bounties :D
[13:25:44] <bagder> did you make sure your car has a bug-bounty before you selected model? =)
[13:26:05] <zelest> haha, no :P
[13:26:07] <zelest> but I know they do
[13:26:15] <zelest> (Tesla)
[13:26:16] <icing> I find this 100 million number doubtful. Even if it takes bagder only 5 seconds to install curl in a car, the would take home over 1000 years to do all of them.
[13:26:35] <bagder> hehe
[13:26:41] <gevaerts> He has minions for that
[13:26:47] <bagder> lunch!
[13:26:51] <zelest> bon apetit!
[13:27:24] <gevaerts> bagder doesn't install curl on all these things. He's too busy sitting in a comfy armchair stroking a white cat while he explains his evil world domination plans to someone
