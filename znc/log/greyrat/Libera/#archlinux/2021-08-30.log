[00:04:16] <sheep> ping is likely using glibc NSS to do to the name resolution. What do you have in the hosts line of /etc/nsswitch.conf?

[00:05:55] <susi> should probably fix 'mymachines' and 'myhostname' too?
[00:06:06] <sheep> so ping would still be going through systemd-resolved before trying a dns query

[03:37:04] <dave_uy> kevr: why the live iso? I did `pacman -S archlinux-keyring` and now the update with `pacman -Syu` seems to be working.
[03:37:15] *** Joins: Thymo (~Thymo@NASSP/developer/Thymo)
[03:37:43] <NetSysFire> pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring may work better, its one of the very few legitimate uses for -Sy
[03:38:41] <dave_uy> That makes sense. I had already done the -Syu just before, so I'm assuming -S is only needed now.
[03:39:12] <dave_uy> I had 800 packages and 13 GB of updates. o_0
[03:39:16] <NetSysFire> rip
[03:39:27] <NetSysFire> -Sy helps because it also automatically fetches the very latest version

[05:31:33] <ParsnipChicken> Hi, I am working on installing Arch Linux on a MacBook5,1 and I need some help getting WiFi working properly. I know that it has wifi hardware, but when I run `device list` in iwctl, no wifi devices are found. Am I missing a driver or something? I checked the Arch Wiki, but there were no internet problems or troubleshooting topics listed with the 5,1 model.

[05:51:47] <ectospasm> Not sure why.
[05:51:58] <ParsnipChicken> Wait so how do I install the correct driver?
[05:52:34] <ectospasm> ParsnipChicken:  try `lspci -knn`, it may already be loaded.
[05:52:55] <kevr> first, keep your system up to date is a good rule to follow, don't let it age for months. second, regardless of the driver, if you were using wicd you're probably going to want to install something else for connecting to APs, like iwd.

[05:53:02] <phrik> Title: Network configuration/Wireless - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[05:53:23] <ectospasm> kevr: no, that article I linked to  (from 2012) mentioned wicd.
[05:53:25] <kevr> wicd is out of date and leaving it in your system is just going to leave stale things around.
[05:53:30] <kevr> oh, i see
[05:53:44] <kevr> my bad!
[05:54:00] <ectospasm> It was the first hit on Google when I searched for 'linux 14e4:432b driver firmware`
[05:55:08] <ParsnipChicken> Ok, so 'lspci -knn' tells me that the driver is b43-pci-bridge and the kernel module is ssb.
[05:55:26] <ParsnipChicken> So i guess it is loaded but not working?
[05:55:41] <kevr> if i remember correctly, it's suggested on those cards to blacklist ssb

[05:58:32] <ectospasm> I can't believe they used Broadcom on a Mac.  I guess that's not exactly news, but it seems odd to me.
[05:59:01] <ParsnipChicken> Very old mac model
[05:59:06] <ectospasm> And an NVIDIA Ethernet card.  Is this not an Intel Mac?
[05:59:58] <ParsnipChicken> Yeah, intel Core 2
[06:00:21] <ParsnipChicken> Not my main workstation though, so It's alright if this doesn't work out
[06:01:00] <kevr> ah man, i've always wanted to get one of those mac workstation computers
[06:01:06] <ectospasm> Broadcom was notorious for not having good Linux support.  Maybe they've gotten better?
[06:01:21] <Namarrgon> they didn't
[06:01:25] <kevr> ectospasm: it's been the same story for like 15 years, install proprietary wl driver

[06:05:12] <kevr> ParsnipChicken: The driver module is 'b43' verbatim. It probably comes with this other b43-pci-bridge module to provide something it needs, but that's not the driver module
[06:05:24] <ParsnipChicken> Ok
[06:05:53] <ParsnipChicken> CPU #0 just froze for no apparent reason :(
[06:06:04] <kevr> is this a macbook?
[06:06:17] <ParsnipChicken> Yeah macbook 5,1
[06:06:21] <kevr> check your cpu temperatures. are they blazing?
[06:06:40] <ParsnipChicken> How do I do that with a frozen cup?
[06:06:45] <ParsnipChicken> *cpu
[06:06:53] <ectospasm> hehehhe, frozen cup
[06:07:01] <ectospasm> Like to put beer in it.
[06:07:04] <kevr> of course you wouldn't, but i'd check if you can reboot or whatever, because if it is you're gonna need to do something to tame it down
[06:07:16] <kevr> most macbooks get hot as hell
[06:07:20] <ectospasm> Put it in the freezer!
[06:07:59] <ParsnipChicken> Honestly this hardware is so frustrating that I might just give up with this whole wifi problem for today.
[06:08:11] <ectospasm> Yeah, and I don't know if Linux can control the fans properly.
[06:08:14] * kevr suggested trying to blacklist ssb a while ago
[06:08:31] <ParsnipChicken> Back when it was running OSX it would get a kernel panic like every 10 minutes :(
[06:09:02] <kevr> that's not good
[06:09:19] <ParsnipChicken> Yeah, also whenever I ran firefox for some reason.
[06:09:36] <ParsnipChicken> They say mac is stable but its really the opposite.
[06:09:53] <ectospasm> Sounds like you may have a hardware problem.
[06:10:02] <ParsnipChicken> Ya think?
[06:10:06] <kevr> i do
[06:10:40] <kevr> i'm wondering if someone frankensteined that machine
[06:10:45] <thrice> core2duo?  It might be time to give this one a viking burial
[06:11:07] <ParsnipChicken> XD
[06:12:24] <ParsnipChicken> Alright well anyway, I'm going to take a break from this for a while. Thank you everyone for all your help! This community is great. Thanks for helping out a poor noob like me. Have a good night!
[06:12:42] <kevr> because really, os x should know about the hardware in this device, and they write the OS so that it treats these devices very well with the specific hardware
[06:12:48] <kevr> if os x is kernel panicking, something seems very wrong

[10:35:21] <grawity> but my point is that HandleLidSwitch= only affects logind's own handling, and *nothing else*
[10:35:27] <kevr> one step though could be you just not having that running and trying to test that logind does what you want it to.
[10:35:48] <grawity> if xss-lock decides to listen for lid events, that's something you can change only in xss-lock itself
[10:36:14] <grawity> but yes, I also *thought* that xss-lock was only listening to logind's "please lock" events and not to lid directly

[11:20:52] <low-key> a simple 'echo 'hi' | wl-copy' and then pasting also enters a new line after the copied text
[11:21:10] <grawity> well your actual *content* has a newline there
[11:21:16] <grawity> `echo "hi"` always outputs "hi" + a newline
[11:21:25] <grawity> try `echo -n "hi"` instead
[11:21:38] <low-key> ahh
[11:21:48] <low-key> so sed outputs a new line too?
[11:22:03] <grawity> if it gets one as input, it writes one as output too
[11:22:30] <low-key> because i'm creating a little emoji picker dmenu thingy and it passes the output to sed to clear everything after the emoji and then passes it to wl-copy
[11:22:50] <grawity> in shell scripts, if you have something like var=$(echo hi) or var=$(sed s/foo/bar/), it's actually the $() that removes the final newline
[11:22:58] <grawity> just as a side note
[11:23:01] <low-key> but it's only supposed to be operating on a single line, dunno how a new line enters into the picture there since it only ever gets one line to work on?

[11:23:35] <low-key> welp
[11:23:40] <grawity> i.e. you don't have \n between lines, you have \n after every line – even if it's just one line, it still has a \n after it
[11:23:50] <grawity> though
[11:24:02] <grawity> when it comes to program stdout, it's unavoidable, unix or not

[11:25:06] <low-key> indeed
[11:25:07] <grawity> but like in .txt files from Windows editors there usually wouldn't be a \n at the end, but from Linux editors there usually would be
[11:25:15] <low-key> so if i want sed to drop the newline, what can i do?
[11:25:27] <grawity> before piping it to wl-copy, you mean?
[11:25:32] <low-key> yup
[11:25:38] <grawity> sed whatever | tr -d '\n' | wl-copy
[11:25:46] <grawity> well, as long as it's exactly 1 line
[11:25:49] <low-key> oh, this is tr is new?

[11:26:35] <grawity> but with -d, it completely removes the given character from everywhere
[11:26:51] <grawity> otoh, if the input might have multiple lines, I'd probably do this instead:
[11:27:07] <grawity> text=$(sed whatever) && printf '%s\n' "$text" | wl-copy

[12:54:27] <ijr> Same problem on with it at 2, it was at 1 before
[12:54:27] <grawity> you need some kernel modules that haven't been loaded yet (probably bridge for docker, tun for VPN)

[13:00:17] <grawity> ijr: that's assuming the two adapters use different modules
[13:00:29] <AlwaysLivid> No, I meant like, Bluetooth being plugged in as a USB. I have no idea how that works.

[13:01:13] <AlwaysLivid> I think that's a bit off-topic, but wow
[13:01:50] <grawity> it's probably literally just the same 4 USB wires going to the same USB controller,

[13:02:25] <AlwaysLivid> It's plugged through a PCIe slot, I think.
[13:02:44] <AlwaysLivid> Like, the same kind of slot you'd put an SSD in.
[13:02:55] <grawity> the M.2 slot has pins both for PCIe and USB 2.0

[15:30:46] <turlando> (cross posting from #sway) I'm having some issues with WebRTC screen sharing. I have 0.3.33, xdg-desktop-portal 1.8.1 and xdg-desktop-portal-wlr 0.4.0. When I run pipewire with 'systemctl --user start pipewire' and then I run xdg-desktop-portal-wlr I get 'pipewire: couldn't connect to context' and 'xdpw: failed to initialize screencast'. If I stop pipewire with systemctl and I run it in my interactive shell then xdg-desktop-portal-wlr run flawlessly. 
[15:30:46] <turlando> Yet I can't get screen sharing to work. I enabled enable-webrtc-pipewire-capturer in Chromium and I'm using https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html to verify my setup. I can choose to share the entire screen, but I only get a black square instead of the desktop input.

[19:49:17] <mpan> Actually the backups are even on a separate partition.
[19:49:47] <Namarrgon> you can also install arch to usb directly, which enables you to simply -Syu instead of redownloading the iso when you need more recent packages

[22:38:12] <GloriousArch> hello! I've put myself in a very weird situation ... (wow 1337 people here)
[22:38:43] <GloriousArch> so I have a 100MB ESP @ /boot, and I use systemd-boot 
[22:38:48] <h4rd3n3D_> ijr:  how many steps?
[22:39:06] <th0rne> 100M seems pretty small.
[22:39:18] <GloriousArch> yes it was autogenrated by windows
[22:39:21] <teraflops> how many OSes do you boot?
[22:39:34] <GloriousArch> and I've never noticed until I started using systemd-boot
[22:39:40] <GloriousArch> just windows 10 and arch
[22:40:01] <th0rne> But maybe you want to generate a fallback and have lts.
[22:40:02] <GloriousArch> I have whopping 4MB of space left!
[22:40:04] <teraflops> 100MB for both is a bit tight imo
[22:40:48] <GloriousArch> so my problem is that I can't `mkinitpio -P` 
[22:40:53] <ijr> h4rd3n3D_: 1 so far, i I started building with makepkg, it patched up the files, now I'm building the C++ files (48262), but I am still suspicious that there may be one more when I finish this one\
[22:41:14] <aaket504> yeah mine is 107MB and I just installed last week. Not many kernel updates
[22:41:22] <GloriousArch> I suspect that I have enough space if the update would be in place
[22:41:23] <teraflops> GloriousArch: ain't you make it larger?
[22:41:47] <GloriousArch> teraflops: there is a windows partition next to it
[22:42:02] <GloriousArch> can I enlarge it without formatting it?

[22:44:07] <teraflops> you can tell mkinitcpio to not create the fallback image, but that's not a good idea if you ask me
[22:44:14] <GloriousArch> yes but sadly systemd-boot can only boot if you also put the vmlinuz and the initramfs in esp

[22:51:42] <th0rne> Can I disable a single usb port? Like unplugging a device, but via cli?
[22:51:44] <GloriousArch> teraflops: oh I know but I could generate the default one without deleting the old fallback
[22:52:06] <GloriousArch> somehow
[22:52:15] <teraflops> yeah, as you can see the fallback image is bigger because it uses all the stuff
[22:52:46] <teraflops> it is easier to boot from it if there is stuff missing in the default image

[23:19:56] <th0rne> You should look at the pkgbuild manually. aura just gives you errors and prompts everytime you try to update nerd fonts or youcompleteme. It's not really useful.
[23:21:03] <th0rne> Also, Arch already ships with a package manager, so it's questionable how useful it is to have another package manager on top.
[23:22:40] <th0rne> Certainly if you have multiple systems running arch, then something like aurutils makes it pretty convenient to just have to build each package on one system.

[23:25:50] <th0rne> Also, aura has had some pretty crazy bugs in the past, like making /tmp not writable.
[23:26:45] <GloriousArch> sounds really bad

[23:27:10] <GloriousArch> do _you_ use an AUR helper?
[23:27:22] <th0rne> I'm a fan of aurutils.
