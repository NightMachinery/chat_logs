[04:52:36] <causative> we can say, first of all, that I affirm the basic reality obtained by science, and that the brain is a physical object within this reality, and that many philosophical questions are best answered not by looking at how we use language, but by looking at how the brain physically operates
[04:53:01] <causative> like, what does someone "mean" when they make a claim? the answer is to be found in the structure of the brain process that produced the claim
[04:53:27] <causative> about which we can make reasonable speculations and simplified models
[04:54:24] <causative> we should consider the mind as a mechanistic system, and develop tools of analysis that can apply to the mind as well as they can apply to any other mechanistic system
[04:54:42] <causative> and frame philosophical questions in terms of these tools of system analysis
[05:02:43] <causative> epistemic justifications have the same structure as physical causation; "I believe X because of Y" should be interpreted as "holding the physical brain-pattern Y causes me to hold the physical brain-pattern X"

[07:12:04] <biys> i actually wanted to ask you a question
[07:12:08] <biys> lemme scroll back and re-up
[07:12:12] <biys> you were gone once i thought of it
[07:12:14] <chlorine> biys: ask away.
[07:12:25] <Player001> biys: overcoming morality is Nietzschean
[07:12:33] <chlorine> biys: i'll be back in a sec.

[07:13:18] <biys> Player001: what i'm saying is that the question seems like it was formulated based on watching soem JBP videos
[07:13:30] <biys> it's almost worded identical
[07:13:53] <Player001> biys: you're not a petersonite are you?
[07:14:01] *** Joins: chlorine (~chlorine@223.235.196.22)

[07:14:30] <dfcnvt> Apparently Jordan Peterson is now well known.
[07:14:59] <biys> i'm not a petersonian or anything like that but i acn tell you i've watched pretty much everything he's put out since 2016
[07:15:00] <chlorine> dfcnvt: i thought you wanted to make money.
[07:15:15] <n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3> Jordan Peterson .... what a time to be alive
[07:15:52] <biys> my favorite part about JBP is his drug addiction while telling people to clean their rooms
[07:15:54] <dfcnvt> n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3: I believe you've watched some YouTube that often end with "What a time to be alive"...Err forogt that name of channel
[07:16:24] <chlorine> biys: did you want to ask something?
[07:16:34] <n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3> no i hate youtube
[07:16:46] <dfcnvt> Two Minute Papers -- that's the channel
[07:16:51] <biys> chlorine: my scrollback is toast.
[07:17:12] <n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3> like more or less every anti-social-meida plattform today
[07:17:20] <chlorine> dfcnvt: i can see why you're not doing anything.
[07:17:48] <chlorine> n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3: what do you mean?
[07:17:50] <dfcnvt> chlorine: My mind is chaotic -- there's a problem with focus
[07:18:03] <chlorine> dfcnvt: no. you enjoy masturbation too much.
[07:18:20] <chlorine> dfcnvt: you're doing it right now.
[07:18:25] <n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3> by anti-social-meida plattform?
[07:18:26] <biys> he's also kind of discussed this at length with Sam Harris
[07:18:33] <biys> but sam harris takes a harm reduction approach
[07:18:34] <chlorine> dfcnvt: i mean no offence.
[07:18:49] <biys> in that anything that reduces harm is admirable and that what's admirable is the reduction of harm
[07:19:16] <chlorine> dfcnvt: if you want to do something, i forgot to mention that you should stay away from here.
[07:19:27] <biys> JBP talks about jacc panksepp the rat tickler too
[07:19:29] <Player001> they're both pseudo-philosophers
[07:19:36] <biys> making a claim that morality might be inherently biological to some extent
[07:19:50] <chlorine> dfcnvt: this is not a place to get something done. this is a place where nerds discuss angels on pinheads without knowing what either are.
[07:19:51] <biys> as a result of the fact that we're ``social creatures''
[07:19:57] <chlorine> dfcnvt: this is your problem.
[07:20:00] <biys> it's kind of evolved into us
[07:20:17] <chlorine> Player001: i agree.
[07:20:22] <dfcnvt> chlorine: None taken -- but I suppose, it's when I stop at everything, "masturbation" or whatnot...I suppose, I get bored and the sub-conscious part of me may want to do something else with no interest to the grave seriousness about what I wanted (to make money)...Instead, I ended up to Chipotle for something to eat.
[07:20:40] <chlorine> dfcnvt: then you're just weak. i like to daydream too.
[07:20:55] <chlorine> dfcnvt: but the Fallingwater you're dreaming of is not going to build itself.
[07:21:21] <biys> i can will it into being
[07:21:25] <chlorine> dfcnvt: i didn't think bad of you when you said you wanted to program yourself into a money-making machine.
[07:21:26] <biys> if i think hard enough about it
[07:21:31] <biys> what do they call that?
[07:21:43] <biys> law of attraction?
[07:21:45] <kish`> n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3, i find youtube is enriching in learning
[07:21:56] <kish`> you can learn about almost anything on youtube
[07:22:10] <chlorine> dfcnvt: but right now when you're jerking-off here after thinking that, that is what disappoints me.
[07:23:09] <chlorine> dfcnvt: in fact, i want you to take offence. maybe that will jolt you into action.
[07:23:17] <biys> hah
[07:23:18] <n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3> 2 good books for the topic of importace of colletive living as a factor for survival for me were The_Conquest_of_Bread & Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution by Peter Kropotkin
[07:23:51] <dfcnvt> chlorine: Well, I don't feel offensed. Nor concerned...
[07:23:55] <n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3> i would say that about yt's database but not about yt
[07:23:59] <chlorine> i wouldn't know i'm in a nerd philosophy board until someone mentions Crime and Punishment or The Conquest of Bread.
[07:24:20] <chlorine> it wouldn't take long either.
[07:24:41] <chlorine> dfcnvt: but i am concerned.
[07:24:51] <biys> i'm not concerned
[07:25:07] <chlorine> dfcnvt: it's like seeing a star fade away right in front of my eyes. you could be much more than this.
[07:25:16] <biys> i haev to write a 1000 word satirical essay on a modern day problem
[07:25:20] <biys> so i picked free speech
[07:25:27] <dfcnvt> I think going through solution-based about what to get me going...is the problem.  Instead, I should be in the community that involves actual money-making...Like in the Stock market community, preferable somewhere in the educational space -- that'd be the environment and exposure to get myself something tangible
[07:25:40] <chlorine> dfcnvt: convincing young idiots about the number of philosophy books you've read summaries of is not going to achieve anything.
[07:25:52] <chlorine> dfcnvt: it's pure masturbation.
[07:26:03] <chlorine> dfcnvt: leave this place.
[07:26:19] <chlorine> dfcnvt: if you don't understand this now, you're pretty stupid.
[07:26:47] <chlorine> mods, don't ban me for now as i'm trying to jolt him back into existence.
[07:26:58] <biys> for now
[07:26:59] <biys> hah
[07:27:06] <chlorine> i won't be long here either.
[07:27:10] <dfcnvt> chlorine: Well, we're mixing two things altogether -- I can be here for philosophial discussion -- that's for the segment of time that I can be here for.
[07:27:22] <chlorine> dfcnvt: there's no philosophical discussion.
[07:27:36] <Player001> conquest of bread is fine but State and Revolution is better :)
[07:27:53] <dfcnvt> My eyeballs are telling me that this is the philosophy channel. So, it is the subject that is preferable by the community
[07:27:55] <chlorine> dfcnvt: do you think is the Lyceum or the Academy?
[07:28:08] <chlorine> dfcnvt: you've been duped.
[07:28:15] <Player001> dfcnvt: your mind has been captured by bourgeois thoughts and dreams
[07:28:22] <chlorine> dfcnvt: this is a far-cry from a philosophical board.
[07:28:35] <chlorine> dfcnvt: this is a circle jerk, as most online boards are.
[07:28:55] <chlorine> dfcnvt: read some book. that would do you better.
[07:29:22] <chlorine> mods, do you hear me?
[07:30:12] <dfcnvt> Just remember, I came here with the specific question that I would hope to gathered of some values...instead you drove me into the direction of your inquires -- So, I oblige.
[07:30:21] <dfcnvt> And here we are, judging about my stupidity.
[07:30:40] <Player001> I am still very confused about this saga
[07:30:44] <chlorine> dfcnvt: no, you came here to waste your time. you know it.
[07:30:46] <n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3> <chlorine> are u also a nerd in this way?
[07:31:34] <dfcnvt> chlorine: How about figuring out why or how does a human being came to "waste time" -- what compel this person to do so?
[07:31:44] <dfcnvt> Am I avoiding something? it is how I came here in this space?
[07:31:45] <chlorine> n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3: i come here from time to time to amuse myself.

[07:41:20] <biys> 8 When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: 9 about sin, because people do not believe in me; 10 about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; 11 and about judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.

[07:58:22] <chlorine> n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3: i used to think the intersex are cross dressers.
[07:59:26] <dfcnvt> I am the puppet to the arbitrary's anchor that, in the cognitive's term, triggered by nature in evoking memories, behaviours, language, and the numerous art of expression in mind and in action

[08:01:26] <n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3> i know when i learned about intersex people shocked me until today that not a single word in germany's hole education system (wich for federal pupises are 16 complete diffrent education systems #gg)

[08:12:31] <chlorine> n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3: if we even ignore the labour aristocracy which is responsible for high income and development levels in Scandinavia and Western Europe, i'd think the xenophobia would make it unbearable for anyone from the Third World to live over there. i don't know why people go there?
[08:15:28] <n0n_b1n4ry_c0d3> not unbearable but it accelerates a more class diveded nation cause of paralell-soceity's like the turkish community here in germany

[10:13:00] <causative> no, the accusation that Socrates corrupted the youth was that he told them not to believe in the gods
[10:13:20] <causative> they didn't like that he was encouraging free thinking among the youth
[10:13:42] <sdfgsdfgs> he spent private time with his boys according to his assistant though
[10:13:53] <sdfgsdfgs> and they all went through a learning process
[10:15:19] <causative> whether or not that's true, that's not what he was put on trial for "corrupting the youth" for
[10:20:44] <sdfgsdfgs> ok I'm convinced that the trial definitely was not about the boys' holes
[10:20:57] <sdfgsdfgs> I should do more research on this

[11:44:09] <megane> causative: some conclusions are based on beliefs that are backed by intuition, feelings and reactions to those feelings. these are formed differently depending on one's genes and previous experiences.
[11:46:13] <causative> yes, they are formed differently at first, but given time and reflection perhaps anyone would converge to the same conclusions
[11:46:29] <causative> they could rationally correct for emotional biases
[11:47:39] *** Quits: I_Am_M00t (uid427178@id-427178.ilkley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[11:51:50] <megane> causative: perhaps they could, if given enough time and persuasion. but, for practical purposes, it's not always going to happen.
[11:52:37] <causative> when I say truth is the limit of investigation, I don't mean for practical purposes - I mean as an ideal, perhaps unattainable
[11:53:00] <megane> it's more likely that one side just gives up on emotional basis and says "you know what. i think you're right afterall" when they truly don't believe that.
[11:53:16] <causative> it's a definition of truth, not a work of psychology
[11:54:53] <causative> I think that if someone thinks emotionally, over time, after they see where that kind of thinking gets them, they would slowly learn to change
[11:55:06] <causative> and start to adopt more reliable methods of forming conclusions
[11:58:27] <arryana> haha.  have you ever -met- anyone?
[11:58:58] <causative> the amount of time and reflection necessary may be greater than the typical person has available
[11:59:42] <causative> or, than many people have available - some do become more even-tempered and rational with age
[11:59:48] <assan> and the atypical person?
[12:00:00] <causative> that person acquires wisdom
[12:00:25] <assan> and what's the use of this wisdom?
[12:00:43] <arryana> adulthood breaks more people than it liberates
[12:00:56] <arryana> you must be very young
[12:01:45] <causative> assan, wisdom is for its own sake - if it has other uses, that's nice too. But wisdom is what gives humans moral value
[12:02:05] <causative> wise minds should not be harmed
[12:02:20] <causative> simple minds, like those of insects or computers, may be harmed without a moral problem
[12:02:57] * arryana rolls her eyes
[12:03:13] <assan> i don't understand your premise causative
[12:03:31] <assan> where are you going with this?
[12:03:34] <arryana> it sounds like more wishful thinking than a premise
[12:04:10] <causative> assan, why do I need to go other places with it?
[12:04:25] <causative> what I've said already is enough
[12:04:40] <assan> i mean what you trying to establish
[12:04:42] * arryana wonders if causative thinks he's speaking with 'wisdom'
[12:05:05] <assan> are you saying a wise man has more value than the fool
[12:05:13] <causative> yes
[12:05:49] <assan> well that's incorrect causative, cause wisdom has everything to do with realizing the valueless nature of existence
[12:05:59] <assan> its really has no value
[12:06:08] <causative> I do not agree
[12:06:18] <assan> so tell me
[12:06:26] <assan> what's the value of life
[12:06:27] <causative> and you don't agree either, because you value many things in life
[12:06:35] <causative> you valued your breakfast
[12:06:52] <assan> you should speak for yourself
[12:07:03] <assan> i eat because my body demands it
[12:07:28] <causative> and your brain demands it
[12:07:34] <causative> and your brain is you, so you demand it
[12:07:45] <assan> my brain is not me
[12:07:54] <causative> then what is you?
[12:07:54] <assan> my brain is a computer
[12:08:04] <assan> i am spirit embodied
[12:08:30] <causative> you simultaneously believe in spirits, and believe that life is valueless? that seems like an odd combination of beliefs to me
[12:08:46] <assan> odd is fine
[12:08:48] <causative> usually people who believe in spirits think that spirits give life value
[12:09:13] * arryana loses interest in watching people talk just to hear themselves and wanders off
[12:09:18] <assan> if spirit was so wise she wouldn't need life
[12:09:24] <assan> or want it
[12:09:59] <causative> well, there's no evidence for spirits
[12:10:07] <causative> no need to include them in your world-model
[12:10:28] <assan> you don't have evidence don't mean i don't
[12:10:36] <causative> what evidence do you have?
[12:10:58] <assan> evidence of spirit is one that can't be told
[12:11:36] <assan> but let's not go far with it
[12:11:58] <assan> my point here is let's not overemphasize wisdom
[12:12:26] <causative> well, each person values their life and things in their life
[12:12:40] <causative> you can't escape from valuing things
[12:12:43] <causative> it's part of who you are
[12:13:03] <assan> learn to speak for yourself
[12:13:13] <causative> I speak for every human being

[12:14:15] <assan> i don't care what's happening in erope
[12:14:29] <causative> maybe not, but you probably care what happens to your immediate family at least
[12:14:39] <assan> no i don't
[12:14:49] <assan> i have no family
[12:14:52] <causative> well, then you care what happens to yourself
[12:14:53] <assan> nor friends
[12:14:59] <assan> no i don't
[12:15:04] <causative> then why did you eat breakfast?
[12:15:13] <assan> am gonna end my life by myself
[12:15:24] <assan> i told you already
[12:15:35] <assan> it's a demand of the body
[12:15:53] <causative> the demand makes itself known by discomfort - hunger
[12:16:03] <causative> if you didn't care about the hunger, you could ignore it
[12:16:13] <assan> my care is irrelevant
[12:16:15] <causative> but you do care about it, and so you ate breakfast to make it go away
[12:16:31] <assan> am going to die by poison not hunger
[12:17:12] <assan> its not about my care, it's about doing what i gotta do to stay alive
[12:17:27] <assan> or better put, stay dead
[12:17:28] <causative> because you care about staying alive
[12:17:39] <assan> no i don't
[12:17:51] <causative> then why did you eat breakfast?
[12:17:54] <assan> am just still watching the stars
[12:18:06] <assan> i told you already
[12:18:23] <assan> am still watching the movie of life
[12:18:45] <causative> if you truly didn't care if you lived or died, why would you bother to kill yourself? why not just continue as you are?
[12:18:57] <assan> and the movie is getting boring so am gonna be exiting the arena soon

[18:09:29] <pussipupu> They don't deliver anything here

[18:38:22] <megane> mnemon: that would be cheap. an adult deer would weight, dunno 200-400kg. but i doubt you could keep the meat if you get caught
[18:38:31] <arryana> most countries accept a copy of your local hunting license and passport
[18:40:10] <arryana> though i'd have to use a rifle, the required pull on a bow is heavier than i use
[18:41:37] <mnemon> megane: adult deer are <100kg
[18:41:44] <mnemon> maybe you're thinking moose/elk?
[18:41:59] <mnemon> but the prices for those is much higher
[18:42:13] <megane> uh.. yeah probably. my bad :P
[18:43:27] <arryana> it has been... nine days since i last fired a gun
[18:43:42] <arryana> though that was just target shooting, nobody hunts with an ak-47
[18:43:56] <mnemon> arryana: you'd have to get the permit but existing one would probably let you skip the courses
[18:44:20] <arryana> usually they just want some assurance you're not a clueless asshat who has never handled a bow before.
[18:44:39] <mnemon> we have fairly strict bureaucracy related to it
[18:45:18] <arryana> i very rarely take down anything bigger than a rabbit, anyway
[18:45:21] <mnemon> you need to get the hunting permit and you need to pass the exams for the specific animal
[18:45:24] <megane> anyway, aren't most reindeers someone's property in finland
[18:45:31] <arryana> if left to my own choices, i hunt with a wrist rocket, and small game.
[18:45:41] <mnemon> megane: yes, but we have other kinds of deers too
[18:45:52] <megane> we do?
[18:46:06] <arryana> if i wanted something bigger i just sent my dog and wolf after it
[18:47:00] <mnemon> valkohäntäpeura, metsäpeura, saksanhirvi, kuusipeura, japaninpeura
[18:48:32] <mnemon> those are the ones you can get hunting permits for :P
[18:50:12] <megane> ugh.. no wonder i confused. now, don't tell me we have more than one kind of titityy as well
[18:50:14] <mnemon> arryana: have they hunted deer? if not they'd prolly end up just wounding one
[18:50:26] <arryana> they were quite competent
[18:50:27] <mnemon> would get extra big fines for a stunt like that in here :o

[18:50:46] <arryana> i'm not looking to wound something, and i only hunt for food.

[18:51:09] * arryana shrugs
[18:51:28] <arryana> again, if i were some random idiot with housepets it would likely be a shitshow.
[18:51:36] <arryana> but my dog and wolf grew up knowing their business.
[18:51:45] <arryana> i hiked the Appalachian trail with them.
[18:51:50] <arryana> and a cat, but he only hunted for himself.
[18:54:19] <mnemon> just reminded me of recent news about random idiots causing damage with their (hunting) pets up north
[18:54:30] <arryana> yeah, i don't advise that sort of thing.
[18:54:44] <arryana> i wouldn't try it with the pair i have now, they know nothing of such things.
[18:54:54] <arryana> they're biddable, and could learn, but they'd have to see it properly done.
[18:55:08] <mnemon> what kind of doggos?
[18:55:12] <arryana> german shepherds
[18:55:29] <arryana> both long haired, one sable, one black
[18:55:35] <mnemon> I guess they'd at least be big enough to take one down potentially
[18:55:39] <arryana> oh yeah
[18:55:53] <arryana> these guys are 75 lbs each.  my first shepherd was 80, and the wolf 95.
[18:56:49] <arryana> but it's more that they knew what to do.  my first shepherd would keep trying to hamstring it while the wolf went to grab its nose and bring it down.
[18:57:02] <arryana> it was fast, and effective.

[19:01:33] <arryana> actually
[19:01:41] <darklambda> what's with the baggy grey sweatsuits?
[19:01:43] <arryana> i have an irc friend that I've known almost 22 years.
[19:01:51] <arryana> we've met once, three years ago.
[19:02:04] <darklambda> ah.. we cal that eyeball meetups
[19:02:12] <darklambda> like in the old irc days

[19:04:17] <arryana> oh man, how cool would that be
[19:04:27] <arryana> i don't, i usually play stationary from the hammock
[19:04:43] <darklambda> in halflife alyx.. you just point to the destination.. so no walking just teleportation
[19:04:47] <arryana> yeah
[19:05:00] <arryana> i do the same with the vr, i get motion sick as hell otherwise
[19:05:03] <darklambda> would be nice if there's actual walking
[19:05:11] <arryana> the visual input is...
[19:05:17] <arryana> it's so -slow-
[19:05:22] <darklambda> yeah.. that's tough
[19:05:24] <megane> arryana: do you match your orientation irl and vr while in the hammock?
[19:05:41] <arryana> i mean, i realize everyone processes visual information at a different speed
[19:05:55] <arryana> but vr feels like being roofied
[19:06:01] <arryana> more or less
[19:06:08] <darklambda> i see
[19:06:20] <arryana> it's more for the range of motion, being suspended in the hammock is great for that
[19:06:54] <arryana> if i want to jump around, i have a ps2, a dance mat, and 'dance factory' in the craft room
[19:06:55] <darklambda> i wonder if facebook is planning to extend the social network that way.. they've been getting techs around that
[19:07:01] <arryana> well
[19:07:06] <arryana> i'm a dinosaur that way
[19:07:10] <mnemon> It was hilarious to play HL2 with the first oculus dev kits, I think we reached the max of 10 minutes before people would be too sick to continue and had to spend the next half an hour trying not to throw up :3

[19:36:30] <biys> is that logically consistent ?
[19:37:02] <biys> it's argued that we're essentially picking and choosing which characteristics and traits we're willing to allow exist
[19:37:06] *** mannequin_ is now known as mannequin
[19:37:13] <biys> is a sickness or a disease a characterist or a trait?
[19:37:16] <biys> well it could be
[19:37:58] <darklambda> biys.. perhaps the land has certain prioritization in laws? like maybe the disease control or health dept  has their say on it?
[19:38:12] <biys> that isn't really the question i'm asking
[19:38:32] <biys> another part of this same argument is something along the liens of my body my choice argument
[19:38:40] <biys> where if they don't wanna be vaccinated they shouldn't have to be

[19:38:56] <biys> if what we're talkin about is the idea for the possibility of harm reduction anyways
[19:39:14] <biys> the claim is that abortion is a harmful prcedure
[19:39:37] <biys> these two arguments pro-anti-vax seem to be pivot points
[19:39:44] <darklambda> does the state of the individual  harm other people?
[19:40:08] <biys> it may or may not i'd say
[19:40:16] <darklambda> or the state of the environment harm the person
[19:40:42] <darklambda> like if they want the environment to has less risk or something... maybe
[19:41:21] <biys> at the end of the day i mean.. the democratiaclly elected officials are making detemrinations they seem necessary to make their constituents happy
[19:41:29] <biys> and that is all the justifitication that is really needed
[19:41:56] <biys> but there's even ANOTHER part to that where as under the guise of diversity marginalized groups are to get a larger stage to express their opinions and beliefs
[19:41:58] <darklambda> well... that sound like politics
[19:42:02] <biys> for example we'll say aboriginals in canada
[19:42:20] <darklambda> there should be some rationale from the health dept or something
[19:42:48] <biys> i don't follow
[19:42:56] <biys> maybe i'm missing my mark here
[19:43:06] <darklambda> here they aim to share via public announements with media intereview right after the announcements.. media to represent peoples questions
[19:43:11] <biys> i'm essentially looking to compare and contrast two sets of ideas

[19:43:42] <biys> yah idk what you think you'er talking about given the context of the conversation
[19:43:49] <biys> i think we might be talking about two different thigns

[19:44:22] <biys> idk why though

[20:01:59] <biys> would i use a re-fill station in a grovery store?
[20:02:02] <biys> i don't think so
[20:02:26] <I_Am_M00t> ok, but what if that was pretty much your only choice
[20:02:52] <I_Am_M00t> or, the alternative might be prohibitively expensive disposable containers
[20:02:53] <biys> well first of all we n eed to talk about few things in this magical scenario you're thinking up
[20:02:57] <biys> how well kept is the establishment?
[20:03:01] <biys> how cleanare their facilities?
[20:03:08] <biys> can i go to another establishment with cleaner facilities?
[20:03:27] <biys> perhaps i can sign up for some kind of service where the equipment is operated by one specific individual to maintain the utmost cleanliness?
[20:03:29] <I_Am_M00t> let's assume they're up to standards, and as Long as the bottle you bring is clean you should be fine
[20:03:57] <biys> which standards?
[20:04:06] <I_Am_M00t> but, regarding sodas you might not get the same level of fizz
[20:04:27] <I_Am_M00t> whatever standards you accept in existing liquids
[20:05:00] <biys> i thought we were talkin about the quality of the cleanliness of the apparatus that we'd all congregate that distributes the good
[20:05:05] <biys> you're all over the place
[20:05:13] <biys> idk what you're talking about or where you're looking to go with this
[20:05:17] <I_Am_M00t> basically, assuming the only compromise is that you have to bring a bottle and fill it, as opposed to buying prepackaged, would it be ok?
[20:05:19] <biys> so i'm also done talking with you
[20:05:30] <I_Am_M00t> what biys ?

[20:06:00] <biys> "what if"
[20:06:01] <I_Am_M00t> yes, would you be ok with such a change in your grocery shopping?
[20:06:07] <biys> your scenario isn't well outlined
[20:06:12] <I_Am_M00t> why not?
[20:06:16] <biys> so idk what it even is i'm attempting to be "okay" with
[20:06:29] <biys> you've not really addressed three questions i've already asked
[20:06:32] <biys> about your scenario
[20:06:53] <I_Am_M00t> yes to all your three questions
[20:07:15] <biys> okay.  so do you know what culigan is?
[20:07:22] <biys> culigan is a water distribution center
[20:07:24] <I_Am_M00t> lol, you seem to have trouble with hypotheticals
[20:07:45] <biys> i'm fine with a hypothetical... it's just your scenario is so void of any real explaination
[20:08:13] <biys> would i go into the ghetto and use their "self serve beverage systems" ?
[20:08:28] <I_Am_M00t> I'm saying, all other things equal, would you be ok with having to bring your own reusable bottles to grocery stores vs buying prepackaged? or would this be a big problem for you?
[20:08:46] <biys> are the self serve beverage systems in the ghetto goign to be as clean and maintained as say ones that are in a area that receives more funding?
[20:08:50] <biys> probably not
[20:08:52] <biys> so i mean
[20:09:00] <biys> there's so much generalization that needs to take place about your question
[20:09:05] <biys> that i don't even know what you think you mean

[20:09:18] <biys> I_Am_M00t: that option already exists

[20:10:12] <biys> you've not forumated this well enough for me to be able to answer
[20:10:12] <I_Am_M00t> are you ok with buying liquids in such a manner?

[20:10:21] <I_Am_M00t> no
[20:10:21] <biys> your description is lacking
[20:10:27] <biys> it's not well formulated

[20:15:43] <I_Am_M00t> how so?
[20:15:47] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[20:15:55] <biys> where as even if you get the vaccin, even though the possibility is reduced and the symptoms may be less sever, you still can have it
[20:16:07] <I_Am_M00t> what? haha
[20:16:42] <biys> context would be certain provinces in canada actually have policy in place preventing unvaccinated peopel from using certain establishments

[20:19:00] <darklambda> i don't there that's that.. from what i understand... perhaps.. maybe it's to protect them.. and encourage them to stay home or minimize public as they're unvacciinated yet
[20:19:19] <biys> why would vaccinated people need protection?
[20:19:30] <biys> they're... vaccinated
[20:19:39] <I_Am_M00t> they can transmit it
[20:19:48] <darklambda> impact is likely higher on unvacc from what i hear
[20:19:59] <biys> so if anything the vaccination would creaet complacency and the non-vaccinated shoujld actually be protected frmo the vaccinated?
[20:20:04] <biys> is that the suggestion?
[20:20:44] <biys> keep in mind i'm fully vaccinated as a result of having to be
[20:20:47] <biys> i had no real say on the matter
[20:20:54] <I_Am_M00t> good

[21:33:35] <darklambda> what happened?
[21:41:24] <arryana> I clicked the wrong thing, new machine
[21:42:58] <darklambda> ooooh
[21:43:19] <darklambda> are you in a VR right now.. and typing in a VR machine?

[21:46:37] <darklambda> i got a idea which might be very probable.. a VR jamming studio.. where you can choose any guitar.. any effect available..
[21:46:58] <darklambda> challenge would be modeling the real things perhaps.. but those exists.. not all.. but some at least
[21:49:04] <arryana> oh, that'd be awesome
[21:49:08] <arryana> how would you deal with lag?
[21:49:52] <darklambda> lag is tough also.. but at least some platforms are doing it.. i haven't tried one for jamming yet
[21:50:14] <darklambda> but music production process should be possible
[21:50:18] * arryana nods
[21:50:28] <darklambda> like sharing tracks and record parts independently
[21:50:28] <arryana> my other half would love that
[21:50:43] <arryana> there's been covid issues with his band, obviously
[21:50:45] <darklambda> can still collaborate live...
[21:50:51] <darklambda> like sharing riffs here and there
[21:50:59] <arryana> yeah

[21:51:55] <darklambda> yeah.. physical music scene has been severly affected
[21:52:14] <darklambda> our group hasn't performed any shows for around 2yrs now
[21:52:33] <darklambda> i mean physically
[21:52:40] <arryana> the other half has spent the last few weeks wiring this place so that his office, two of the bedrooms, the zen room and the lounge can each be occupied, but everyone playing 'together'
[21:52:53] <darklambda> last year, we did our groups annual anniversary online
[21:52:56] <arryana> this way everyone has a room to themselves and an open window

[21:53:31] <darklambda> that's nice arrangement
[21:53:47] <arryana> we'll see if it works.  it impresses the hell out of me that he can arrange the gear.
[21:56:02] <arryana> i like listening to it, so it's bonus if they practice here
[22:01:55] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i tend not to watch joe rogan
[22:02:09] <megane> i know people who practice classical music online.. the lag is not an issue, provided you are close enough.. they had <2ms lag

[22:02:31] <biys> latency technically has nothign to do with distance
[22:02:37] <biys> well.  a small portion of it has to do with distan e
[22:03:04] <biys> there's QoS associated with a lot of our data
[22:03:24] <biys> and it is likely that unless you pay for some kind of SLA you're going to get near the top of that QoS
[22:04:21] <arryana> online, yes.  in vr, there is more lag.
[22:04:48] <biys> idk what that means
[22:04:53] <biys> vr != online ?
[22:05:00] <biys> i'm lost with what arryana thinks they mean
[22:06:31] <megane> biys: technically, distance has a lot to do with latency, when we're talking sub 100ms times
[22:06:39] <arryana> have you used vr much?
[22:07:05] <arryana> they're still working out a lot of issues, it isn't always streamlined yet
[22:11:50] <I_Am_M00t> biys: oh, why? he's got interesting guests sometimes

[23:05:40] <causative> the chief business of philosophy is deciding what brain-patterns should go in your head. The decision is made based on what appeals to your current brain-patterns.
[23:07:04] <causative> brain-patterns have "affinities" for other brain-patterns, such that when one brain-pattern is already held, and another is presented that the first has an affinity for, the first pattern causes the second pattern also to be held
[23:08:36] *** Joins: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414)
[23:09:33] <causative> brain-patterns also have "discordances" with other brain-patterns, such that when two brain-patterns are held that are discordant, and attention is brought to them, a tension arises that tends to be resolved by eliminating one or the other brain-pattern
[23:10:03] <causative> or, if not by destruction, the tension is resolved by rearranging their structure to eliminate the discordance
[23:18:50] *** Joins: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter)
[23:26:19] <causative> implicit in the above, is that some brain-patterns are "active" in the arena of awareness, while others are dormant, so that discordances may persist among dormant patterns, but must be resolved among active patterns in the arena
