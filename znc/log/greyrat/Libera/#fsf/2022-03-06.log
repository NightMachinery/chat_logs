[17:21:46] <Kaiod> Good morning everyone!
[17:23:51] <kompowiec2> heyo
[17:24:14] <Kaiod> In my house, the vast majority use Spotify. In the last few days, I noticed that they made changes in the Linux version, and I saw that there was a tab written "About recommendations".... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/348ef5430d60443ead89815026ece4d8774d2f29)
[17:26:47] <Kaiod> The text sounds a bit forced to me, because what it sounds like is that they use the users' data, share it with their employees (editors and others for analysis) and give back to the user a content based on it, so it sounds manipulative to me (including the part that says about commercial issues).

[17:34:03] <qrpnxz> Kaiod: they don't have people make recommendations on-the-fly for particular people. That is impossible. They probably make several playlists tagged a certain way, and then a program tries to assign music to users based on their usage information in a listen-time maximizing way.
[17:36:39] <Kaiod> qrpnxz: Yes, I have thought this through. Or they use the data from X geographic region for commercial interests, and filter them based on the user's tastes, it seems like something complex.

[19:12:54] <qrpnxz> the fact that GNU purports itself to be an operating system, but you can't "download GNU" or "install GNU" is very confusing. Debian is an OS, Fedora is an OS, GNU i'd call a software project sure, but not an operating system.

[19:16:52] <jxself> How much more official can it get?
[19:18:06] <qrpnxz> I think there is a communication problem here because i don't know what you think you are addressing. Guix is an OS yes, it's part of GNU project yes. Is Guix "the GNU OS"?

[19:21:45] <qrpnxz> what is "that"?
[19:22:02] <qrpnxz> i asked is Guix "the GNU OS", and you reply "that's what i'm trying to talk about" I am confused.
[19:22:45] <jxself> What else would an operating system developed by and downlodable from the GNU Project be?
[19:22:46] <kompowiec2> qrpnxz, nah, good point. however, despite our best efforts to speak GNU / Linux, it eventually became grammar nazi meme
[19:23:26] <jxself> Are you trying to ask if there are two operating systems being developed by the GNU Project? The 2 being Guix and the "GNU OS"? There is only 1 operating system being developed by the GNU Project.
[19:23:29] <qrpnxz> jxself: that would make it *an* "GNU project" OS
[19:23:34] <kompowiec2> I have no idea how to explain to anyone what GNU actually is.

[19:26:36] <jxself> And I've already pointed to where to go download it. I can't help if you want to refuse and try to maintain the position that GNU isn't developing an operating system, even after pointing to the gnu.org download link to go get it.
[19:28:00] <qrpnxz> so is Guix "the GNU OS" then? Seems like a simple question but i can't get a straight answer. If i install Guix is that the same as "installing GNU". Is Guix GNU? I not asking if it's part of the GNU project, i'm asking is Guix the operating system otherwise known as "GNU"

[19:30:49] <kompowiec2> wikipedia says that GNU is an extensive collection of free software. Saying that GNU is a operating system can be confused if you search directly GNU not eg. GNU/debian

[19:31:33] <jxself> After all of these years RMS didn't want it to be called the official GNU system out of concern that it might be seen as elevating it up over the other endorsed distros so we don't treat it any differently than any other.
[19:31:36] <river> GNU is part of an operating system......
[19:31:58] <river> wikipedia is wrong about some things related to GNU
[19:32:18] <jxself> Yes, there are a number of active Wikipedians that are against GNU.
[19:32:22] <jxself> But I won't name them.
[19:32:25] <kompowiec2> ok, so in official page: https://www.gnu.org/software/ says "GNU is an operating system which is 100% free software."
[19:33:25] <kompowiec2> if I didn't know what I know about GNU, I would really be wondering what the GNU system is and how to get it.
[19:33:38] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[19:33:45] <qrpnxz> right, i see GNU as a project that maintains a lot of free software, so then i read about how Stallman "released the GNU operating system", i'm left to wonder what that actually means. If what it means is that stallman released Guix, that makes sense because Guix is a full OS, you can install it on your computer, it runs the hardware and all that. But just a collection of programs, that's not
[19:33:47] <qrpnxz>  per se an OS
[19:34:11] <river> you can get a GNU linux distribution on the site
[19:34:18] <river> like trisquel or ubuntu
[19:34:40] <qrpnxz> i interpret that as a distribution of GNU software and Linux, see?
[19:34:45] <jxself> RMS isn't really actively involved in software development coding. So he himself hasn't released software in some time.
[19:34:58] <river> what are you talking about?
[19:35:11] <qrpnxz> who is you
[19:35:37] <kompowiec2> so, if it's *part* of an operating system, wouldn't that sound more correct?
[19:35:46] <river> it is part
[19:35:49] <river> you also need a kernel
[19:35:55] <jxself> But GNU is a whole OS and GNU has 2 of those.
[19:36:12] <jxself> It has HURD and Linux-libre which was desginated an official piece of GNU back in, I think, 2012.
[19:36:38] <jxself> And Guix, being an official GNU activity, lets you use both HURD and Linux-libre.

[19:38:04] <river> you cannot watch youtube videos on it
[19:38:21] <jxself> Phoronix did a review some years ago and found it to be working quite well.
[19:38:22] <qrpnxz> why not? it cannot use my graphics card?
[19:38:52] <jxself> The last I checked something like 80% of Debian Main compiled and runs without issue.
[19:39:08] <jxself> Which included an important piece: A web browser. :)
[19:39:55] <qrpnxz> 80% of debian is like 8 times more packages than fedora haha so that's a lot, but i'm guessing  some important packages may not work?
[19:39:57] <jxself> So it only seems logical that Guix, being an official GNU thing, should also allow for this option and not just random third party disros. :)
[19:40:30] <qrpnxz> it's not exactly surprising, but also not expected.

[19:42:05] <qrpnxz> also hyperbola is working on BSD
[19:42:16] <jxself> So if you objectively look at all: That it is made of GNU components, by GNU people, and hosted on GNU servers, it's as officially the "GNU OS" as you're going to get. All that's missing is RMS's official blessing that it is ***the*** "GNU OS". But as I said he didn't want to desginate it as that, even though for all practical intents and purposes, it is.

[19:43:51] <qrpnxz> so i gather then that GNU as an OS is not really a thing, just GNU based OS
[19:44:16] <jxself> The idea for it even came from a discussion I started on one of the mailing lists after Linux-libre was designated to be a GNU package. I said something like "Well now GNU has a working kernel. It is time to actually make a release and get it out the door?" And that started the effort to get it all packaged up and out the door.
[19:44:52] <jxself> If anything is "the GNU OS", it would be Guix.
[19:45:35] <jxself> So if that's what you're looking for, go download it and have fun. After all these years you can acutally download a whole system from the gnu.org doain name. :)
