[00:08:25] <corwin> I find the post-commit approach super handy for literate projects.  If the code is already getting tangled from org sources then there's zero extra steps to keep README.* up-to-date.  It uses an amend on the commit to avoid 'extra' commits vs those which are explicitly given.

[03:33:24] <wasamasa> and considering that printf is a small turing-complete language in C...
[03:33:39] <wasamasa> why not instead have a bunch of chained functions and avoid the turing-completeness
[03:33:41] <technomancy> hyiltiz: anyway I'd prefer using pcase over cond for any situation where the condition can be expressed declaratively
[03:34:30] <technomancy> hyiltiz: or for things like if-let where you want to bind the result in a local
[03:34:40] <wasamasa> there were a few efforts to have format combinators in scheme
[03:35:08] <wasamasa> whereas CL FORMAT is just bonkers
[03:35:17] <wasamasa> not sure whether it's turing-complete, but it wouldn't surprise me
[03:36:07] <technomancy> to me it seems like there's a huge split between "I just want to pretty-print some data" vs "no I actually have some specific formatting I want to use here" and shoving both those use cases into printf is a big part of why it sucks so much

[05:44:21] <blacked> Hello
[05:44:52] <blacked> Is there any way to disable cursor changing position when scroll through mouse?
[05:46:06] <twb> people have asked that but I don't remember if there is an answer
[05:46:16] <twb> you're essentially asking for the cursor to be offscreen

[05:53:01] <johnjaye> amazing. doom emacs installs some mode that removes the modeline
[05:53:10] <johnjaye> i reject your mode and replace it with my own
[05:53:31] <blacked> get rid of that heavy bloated things
[05:53:44] <johnjaye> blacked: you can use set-mark then C-x C-x for such problems
[05:53:52] <johnjaye> basically a way to quickly return to some point

[05:56:32] <hyiltiz> how a) feasible and b) practically useful to implement something like Functor for various elisp stuff, mostly lists of lists of .... of lists?
[05:56:46] <hyiltiz> or even something like lens?
[05:57:08] <twb> hyiltiz: what does "functor" mean to you
[05:59:02] <johnjaye> sounds like a haskell thing

[05:59:48] <hyiltiz> it *is* a haskell "thing"
[06:00:28] <hyiltiz> being able to use fmap to apply functions to first element of pairs, or each elements of a list, or, when injected once, the list inside a list
[06:00:49] <hyiltiz> the fmap interface in haskell is what functor means to me
[06:01:11] <hyiltiz> ideally being able to follow the functorial laws, with fmap wrapped inside sweet sugar
[06:02:35] <johnjaye> cl-mapcar does something like that
[06:02:37] <johnjaye> ,(cl-mapcar '+ '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) '(7 8 9))
[06:02:50] <hyiltiz> so does mapc, no?
[06:03:15] <johnjaye> mapc only takes 1 sequence, the common lisp version takes an arbitrary amount
[06:03:24] <johnjaye> that should print (12 15 18)
[06:03:27] <johnjaye> but fsbot is gone
[06:03:40] <johnjaye> you can take a look at the common lisp hyperspec for ideas

[06:06:03] <hyiltiz> Something like this

[12:32:03] <ychaouche> yeah but like I'll eventually be learning conditionals and branching and loops and stuff
[12:32:03] <wasamasa> one is a buffer-local variable, the other a function accepting an optional buffer argument

[12:32:43] <wasamasa> welcome to lisp-2
[12:33:07] <wasamasa> an identifier can refer to both variables and functions
[12:33:38] <wasamasa> as opposed to lisp-1 where you cannot have both at the same time

[20:02:43] <YoungPotato> Yeah, that's true. You can change arguments to fzf, but that does not allow you to only select folders as input. It also allows you to select lists as inputs on which you want to use fzf, but that is where I ran into an issue when the list is very long: a) it is very slow; b) fzf throws an error (exit code 126). Here is a an example of a little snippet that I wrote to get use fzf on folders: https://dpaste.org/6ZyU

[21:03:15] <contrapunctus> bpalmer: that snippet already does that - the slot name is automatically used for the `:initform` and `:accessor` ...but I don't know how to add >1 slot that way, and that's my question 🤔️

[21:12:36] <Bayes> in fact I'm not 100% happy with having a git hook as "ideally" I was hoping I could use a file local variable in my parent.org file so that its 100% autocontained but it's not really worth the engineering anyway
