[00:01:01] <tirnanog> yes. however, as this is bash code by definition, consider using [[.
[00:01:41] <earendel> u never use test or [?
[00:01:47] <earnestly> Not in bash
[00:02:03] <earendel> why?
[00:02:11] <tirnanog> ![vs[[
[00:02:12] <greybot> '[', also known as 'test' is the POSIX variant of [[. [ does NOT support ==, =~, &&, ||, glob pattern matching; unquoted > and < will do file redirection instead of comparison, etc. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031
[00:02:37] <tirnanog> in short, there is no utility in doing so. I can think of only one use case and it's so obscure, I don't even feel like spelling it out.
[00:02:45] <earnestly> But as I stick mostly to POSIX, I do use [.  But when I use bash, I use [[ because it's better in every way
[00:02:47] <tirnanog> moreover, the problem would not have occured had you done so.
[00:04:34] <earendel> using [[ i can use -d ... without quotes on $f

[04:55:32] <zeno1> i want create post install script for void linux. I cant figured out how to use answers from dialog checklist. no problems with menu where is only one answer...
[04:58:01] <jcbjoe2021> i've asked this question in #linux  but really didn't get the question answered. i want to list filetypes in a directory by extension. once found i want to open that directory with lets say one of the file types so if i don't like what i see i can delete it in linux with the rm command, is this possible? i ran this command find . -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c and it showed me how many files of what type i have in the
[04:58:01] <jcbjoe2021> current directory and below, now i want to open the current directory with lets say the 4 files it found for mp4 files and play them. can i do this?
[04:58:40] <emanuele6> zeno1: you want something like this i think http://paste.wooledge.org/9382
[04:58:51] <e36freak> zeno1: capture the stdout of dialog, it'll print everything that was selected
[04:59:02] <e36freak> you should probably use --separate-output with it so you get one thing per line
[04:59:06] <e36freak> instead of trying to parse quotes and shit
[04:59:57] <e36freak> jcbjoe2021: what do you mean by "open the directory" ? i'm not sure i understand what you want to do
[05:00:33] <tirnanog> yeah. I mean, if you match a file with a given extension across multiple directories, say, as was implied by the use of a recursive find command in your example, "the directory" is somewhat ambiguous.
[05:00:44] <tirnanog> if you could refine a little, it would be good.
[05:01:47] <jcbjoe2021> e36freak: I’m trying to shrink my external hard drive. There are a lot of file types on there like m4v and mo4 files. I want to list all mp4 or m4c files play them and see if I need them. Once played I can delete them manually with the rm command
[05:01:52] <jcbjoe2021> Hope that helped
[05:02:35] <karstensrage> no im just trying to time how long the script takes
[05:02:38] <e36freak> well, find . -type f -iname '*.mp4' # will recursively find all mp4 files
[05:02:46] <karstensrage> so before inside.sh i capture $SECONDS
[05:02:51] <e36freak> you can then loop over that output and pass them to a given player
[05:02:53] <tirnanog> right.
[05:03:02] <karstensrage> and after i capture elapsed=$(( SECONDS - start_time ))
[05:03:12] <e36freak> you could even then have a thing that asks "remove file?" in the loop afterward and removes them or not
[05:03:13] <tirnanog> perhaps by way of an intermediate playlist file that you edit as you proceed to listen to its contents.
[05:03:19] <e36freak> you could also do that
[05:03:24] <karstensrage> in a test script with sleep it works
[05:03:32] <karstensrage> but in the real thing with inside.sh it doesnt
[05:03:51] <tirnanog> i.e. leaving only those that you want to be deleted.
[05:05:20] <jcbjoe2021> e36freak: how would I type that out?
[05:05:28] <e36freak> while IFS= read -rd '' file <&3; do mpv "$file"; read -rp 'Remove? [y/N]'; [[ $REPLY = [Yy]* ]] && rm "$file"; done < <(find . -type f -iname '*.mp4' -print0)
[05:05:31] <e36freak> erm
[05:05:36] <e36freak> while IFS= read -rd '' file <&3; do mpv "$file"; read -rp 'Remove? [y/N]'; [[ $REPLY = [Yy]* ]] && rm "$file"; done 3< <(find . -type f -iname '*.mp4' -print0)
[05:05:39] <e36freak> for example
[05:06:04] <jcbjoe2021> You just typed all that e36freak ?
[05:06:08] <e36freak> sure
[05:06:10] <tirnanog> perhaps rm -v for some feedback.
[05:06:16] <e36freak> maybe put an echo in front of rm to test
[05:06:22] <e36freak> rm -v also wouldn't hurt
[05:06:29] <jcbjoe2021> Dam e36freak I been looking online all day for commands
[05:06:49] <tirnanog> you made the right decision coming here from #linux.
[05:07:00] <jcbjoe2021> Yea 😀
[05:07:55] <jcbjoe2021> Should I even try to understand that bash script?
[05:07:57] <e36freak> karstensrage: why not just run the script with time?

[07:42:11] <tirnanog> in the absence of a valid shebang, it's not a valid executable. the kernel should respond with ENOEXEC. however, some shells don't propagate the error and respond to it by then trying to open and interpret the script.

[08:11:20] <eschwartz> on execlp, it should be noted -- fun! -- that the file shall be executed with argv shifted over to insert, as argv0, "an unspecified pathname for the sh utility"
[08:11:36] <tirnanog> eschwartz: bash simply uses execve(), as far as I can tell. it does, in fact, catch ENOEXEC as I mentioned. it's not a case of /bin/sh being invoked (mine is dash). I can reproduce the same behaviour with dash also. I think the initial commentary is material to the problem.
[08:11:58] <eschwartz> it can be any form of sh -- and depending on what actually handles this, it may use /bin/sh (common, handled at the glibc level on linux)
[08:12:34] <eschwartz> bash uses execve IIRC specifically to evade that POSIX requirement and so that it instead can use itself, not /bin/sh
[08:13:02] <eschwartz> it's allowed to do that, the standard just defines what execvp/execlp do -- not what *shells* do :p
[08:13:18] <tirnanog> yes, I know. but bash isn't the only shell to do it. that was my point.
[08:14:00] <eschwartz> some shells do use exec*p there, but I forget which ones
[08:15:26] <eschwartz> anyway since I don't understand karstensrage's problem I merely observed that it can be reasonably viewed as "really bad style, but yes it's technically a valid executable if you squint. In the general case"
[08:15:33] <tirnanog> my guess it that it's this: his /bin/sh isn't bash. his cron implementation uses /bin/sh to execute his script which is lacking a shebang. the /bin/sh implementation intercepts ENOEXEC and handles the script itself. no SECONDS. in the case of a shell that is using execv*p, same difference, I suppose.
[08:15:57] <eschwartz> that sounds like a reasonable guess, yeah...
[08:15:59] <tirnanog> I can't really agree there. the meaning of ENOEXEC is unambiguous. that it 'runs' is another matter.
[08:16:17] <tirnanog> I mean, I get your point but ... eh, whatever.
[08:16:25] <eschwartz> (you do need to squint...)
[08:16:36] <tirnanog> yeah.
[08:17:58] <eschwartz> using a proper shebang guarantees correct behavior everywhere, especially in cron which is a well known source of "actually you were not running the shell you thought you wanted to use"
[08:18:50] <tirnanog> yeah. here's a fair chance that defining the SHELL is possible but still, it's just bad form to call out to an executable script that lacks a shebang. as I told him earlier, just don't do it.

[08:23:30] <eschwartz> pj: I'd prefer something like #!hint/bash
[08:23:33] <tirnanog> pj: I could see it making sense in some cases. if only false were always under /bin, though.
[08:23:59] <pj> so /usr/bin/env false ?
[08:24:05] <eschwartz> which completely fails to find anything, almost certainly, but also conveniently triggers most editors' shebang detection methods
[08:24:10] <tirnanog> yeah, that's a better idea.

[09:09:33] <emanuele6> extern: yes, then why was "somethin" not printed
[09:10:23] <emanuele6> the initial '*' makes the ERE not valid, but GNU grep happens to accept it and probably just ignores it
[09:10:40] <eschwartz> p-i-: do:() { (PS4='+ '; set -x; "$@") }
[09:10:48] <emanuele6> the final 'g*' has the meaning of "zero or more 'g' characters"

[09:19:33] *** Joins: extern (~archer@141.226.59.235)
[09:19:47] <tirnanog> for one thing, yes.
[09:19:59] <emanuele6> p-i-: the HEREDOC is also unnecessary
[09:20:04] <emanuele6> you can simply write
[09:20:07] <emanuele6> cmds='
[09:20:10] <emanuele6> my command;

[09:21:22] <emanuele6> yes, you definitely want 'EOF'
[09:21:47] <emanuele6> you are getting away with not having it only because you are not using variables in your script
[09:22:15] <eschwartz> emanuele6: it's not ssh per se, but if you try printing the args to ssh you discover it is runnning the following command + argv

[09:23:27] <p-i-> Ah I remembered why I had to use a more involved pattern. The $cmds itself needs to inssert a couple of $foo $bar variables.  https://bpa.st/BWRQ

[09:24:51] <tirnanog> p-i-: that wasn't my question. it was one of whether you're going to keep doing it indefinitely.
[09:24:54] <emanuele6> p-i-: that is a code injection
[09:25:16] <emanuele6> but you don't need an HEREDOC there too, you can simply use "" instead of ''
[09:25:29] <emanuele6> but you should not, because that is a code injection
[09:25:42] <tirnanog> because set -x is often used temporarily for debugging purposes. I have my reason for asking.
[09:25:51] <tirnanog> humour me and assume I have a good reason for asking.
[09:28:20] <p-i-> Sorry, just having trouble parsing your question. It's a setup.sh script for remote-setting up boxes. https://bpa.st/BTEA
[09:28:36] <tirnanog> let me put it as simply as possible: will set -x ever be removed?
[09:28:54] <tirnanog> (yes or no)
[09:28:55] <p-i-> Every time I need to add a package I fiddle the script, and re-run. It loops over deployed boxes.
[09:29:58] <p-i-> I still don't understand. I don't manually remove it. But if I later shell into my box, it isn't echoing back my commands. So I assume it is no longer in effect.
[09:30:16] <eschwartz> do you use set -x to debug your changes or is it intended to be a permanent part of the script
[09:30:19] <tirnanog> I'm asking if you ever will, not if you do at the present time.
[09:30:21] <tirnanog> it's a very simple question.

[10:03:49] <greybot> seq(1) is nonstandard, inefficient and useless. For bash2.04+/zsh/ksh93, use for ((i = 1; i <= 10; i++)); do ..., bash3.0+, use for i in {1..10}, for POSIX and other shells, see !counting

[10:04:44] <alkisg> (I couldn't do the other commands you said as I don't know bashisms yet, e.g. ++i wouldn't cross my mind... :))
[10:04:49] <emanuele6> it's not a matter of optimization, it's a matter of code correctness
[10:05:06] <geirha> for such a small range, I'd use brace expansion in an interactive session. for i in {1..255}; do

[10:05:09] <alkisg> That's very nice!
[10:05:22] <eschwartz> the other mentioned problem is that you can run out of memory if you iterate over lots of values and that for loop expansion explodes

[10:10:18] <alkisg> and start using them in scripts too, and they'll work while I test them in bash, and then fail when I update-initramfs and try to boot a client and run them in busybox...
[10:10:26] <pj> they think they know better for everything they build.
[10:10:45] <eschwartz> I mean do they really seriously think that stripping out line editing is faster
[10:10:48] <alkisg> A "language variant" does require dedicating some time to learn it properly
[10:11:55] <alkisg> OK back to work, thank you all!

[15:30:16] <NRK[m]1> without looking too deep, i think your problem probably lies here `zpfl="IMGSOAA_PPD_*.zip"`
[15:30:46] <Soliton> it's given to find so it's fine.
[15:30:59] <Soliton> no clue why find got involved now though.
[15:32:27] <wwilliam> Soliton: because i have to find after -newer so i dont process the older ones again.
[15:33:04] <Soliton> i see.
[15:33:07] <wwilliam> That is OK is the counter part and mv that is not working.
[15:33:14] <wwilliam> nothing moves...
[15:33:32] <NRK[m]1> so find is able to expand * on it's own. i see...
[15:33:39] <wwilliam> I just get this:

[17:02:53] <Soliton> if that's really necessary or if there are better ways to organize this of course is anyone's guess.

[17:03:18] <wwilliam> https://paste.debian.net/1213990/

[17:07:54] <wwilliam> The recon file is need it in the dir so another developeer looks at it and kick his program, if this recon is not in the dir the other developer program will not work.

[17:08:50] <wwilliam> Like i said I have to rsynd them from remote server and processed them
[17:09:14] <Soliton> so the logical first step is to go through the recon files. which btw you have not once stated so far.

[17:10:19] <wwilliam> The present script not the one you guys have seen

[17:10:49] <wwilliam> customer started to missed transmissions for days
[17:11:03] <wwilliam> and send few days together
[17:11:26] <Soliton> so are you just hoping the date in the filenames will be the same as what's in the csv or that must be the case?
[17:11:51] <wwilliam> so the present script was not capable of doing that, hence the regex for the dates now and this mess I do not know how to resolve unless i process manually
[17:11:56] <wwilliam> which i dont want

[17:16:05] <earendel> lol
[17:16:18] <Soliton> i'm guessing you process each hour or whatever and when you do processing again with the same date in files you already processed you want a new dir.

[17:21:43] <earnest> tangy: No, don't! :o
[17:21:44] <Soliton> i guess so.
[17:21:57] <earendel> the goal is mislead in a obvious way
[17:22:02] <wwilliam> no
[17:22:03] <earnest> 'sort by recon'?
[17:22:05] <Soliton> so you edit the csv file?
[17:22:06] <wwilliam> is not misslead
[17:22:06] <earnest> How do you sort by them
[17:22:10] <wwilliam> Soliton: no
[17:22:11] <earendel> because we ran out of tshirts last year alreadyt.
[17:22:26] <Soliton> earendel: same regex aka timestamp.
[17:22:32] <Soliton> err earnest
[17:22:45] <Soliton> i guess i should ignore the other guy.
[17:23:00] <earnest> But that would mean they extract the timestamp from the recon filename, which they aren't doing
[17:23:01] <earendel> again.
[17:23:07] <earendel> another mislead.
[17:23:14] <earendel> lol. soliton watch it.
[17:23:20] <earendel> keep it tasty.
[17:23:21] <Soliton> earnest: that's what the regex does.
[17:23:44] <Soliton> the match is the timestamp.
[17:23:50] <wwilliam> yes
[17:24:13] <tangy> [uh, "tasty" is someone else, thx ;) ]
[17:24:14] <Soliton> wwilliam: but the csv file is the index? or the index is some other file?
[17:24:27] <earnest> Soliton: The directory listing shows many such things, some of which are 'recon' files (be recon I assume the ones called Reconciliation
[17:24:40] <earnest> So the regex would match more than just the recon files
[17:24:44] <earendel> hm. maybe it wasnt me who put wwilliam on the ignore list. and wwilliam is my thai connection.
[17:24:46] <earendel> but then no.
[17:24:53] <Soliton> the timestamp is always the same.
[17:24:56] <wwilliam> Soliton: the index is another file.
[17:25:09] <Soliton> that's how they know what files belong together.
[17:25:18] <earnest> Soliton: So then why do the recon files matter?  That's what I'm confused about lol
[17:25:27] <wwilliam> earnest: no one reconciliation per files
[17:25:37] <Soliton> that is the part i don't fully know yet either.
[17:25:53] <earendel> lol
[17:26:02] <wwilliam> The recon files matter again
[17:26:07] <wwilliam> because no recon
[17:26:13] <earnest> As far as I'm concerned the recon files need to exist, and that there needs to be more than two of them.  Then they don't matter afterwards
[17:26:17] <earnest> because that's what the script tells me
[17:26:18] <wwilliam> the next developer program will not kick
[17:26:33] <Soliton> so again the first step is to go through the recon files.
[17:26:48] <Soliton> extract timestamp, gather all files that belong to it.

[19:08:38] <n8chan> is that usage of eval incorrect?

[23:36:05] <greybot> [ is NOT part of the `if' syntax. It's a normal, ordinary COMMAND, like grep and rm. Like `if grep ..', `if [' just checks its exit status. And just like `ifgrep`, `if[` is wrong. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/TestsAndConditionals
[23:36:09] <tirnanog> thanks.
[23:36:51] <Soliton> jam() { if [ "$1" = search ] ...
[23:37:07] <Soliton> just make it a function. why do you need the alias?
[23:37:11] <tirnanog> !pf 10
[23:37:11] <greybot> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#pf10 -- Don't do this! -- if [bar="$foo"]; then ...
[23:37:13] <tirnanog> also applies.
[23:37:32] <rundown> Soliton:when i finish it i want to use it as an alias in my bashrc
[23:37:40] <Soliton> why?
[23:37:43] <tirnanog> yes, why?
[23:38:02] <rundown> eventually i want to substitute an original command for a new one
[23:38:08] <tirnanog> just declare jam() { ... } in the first place.
[23:38:14] <tirnanog> you're done.
[23:38:16] <Soliton> how is the function not doing that?
[23:38:23] <rundown> ah ..sorry i get you
[23:38:25] <rundown> ok thanks

[23:49:42] <tirnanog> still, for as long as you do use macOS, you might consider installing bash from brew. having done so, you should be able to specify "#!/usr/bin/env bash" as a shebang in order to use a modern bash.
