Sandra Bem's goal of the BSRI was to examine psychological androgyny and provide empirical evidence to show the advantage of a shared masculine and feminine personality versus a sex-typed categorization.

[01:50:04] <Parf> well now we're making some progress. so acceptance can be neutral?
[01:52:30] <raincomplex> not sure i follow
[01:54:25] <Parf> can i accept an aspect of humanity without actively tolerating it or endorsing it
[01:55:38] <raincomplex> we give names to terrible things. is it not the same?
[01:56:19] <lucky> I think that ritual funerary cannibalism is actually an almost categorically human practice, and a reflection of our spirituality
[01:56:41] <lucky> if only prions weren't such a big deal
[01:56:44] <Parf> is naming a thing an acceptance of it
[01:56:52] <Parf> yeah, eaters of the dead, eh lucky
[01:57:45] <lucky> aside from, of course, the deep revulsion due to my cultural background, it's only something humans would do, because it's operating on a very human level, involving the transfer of power and spirit from one body into another
[01:58:09] <lucky> (:
[01:58:22] <lucky> or they were hungry, I'm not an expert on this
[01:59:20] <raincomplex> parf i think you're getting caught up in 'accept'. i was referring to defining 'humanity', not making a moral judgement
[02:00:04] <Parf> fair enough
[02:00:23] <Parf> i do maintain that my question is important, however
[02:00:28] <Parf> and it's a distinction few make
[02:00:42] <Parf> lately, anything save endorsement is labeled "hate"
[02:01:42] <raincomplex> i agree the question is interesting. i think it has to do with the use-mention distinction
[02:01:49] <raincomplex> lucky, that's a very interesting point
[02:02:26] <Parf> much better way to try to label man, i agree, by his rituals
[02:02:36] <Parf> or humanity, rather
[02:03:31] <Parf> though, we might not be able to contextualize certain otherwise obvious rituals performed by animals
[02:04:06] <raincomplex> yeah. what are those birds really up to, anyway?
[02:04:23] <Parf> some people theorize that they're government owned robots
[02:04:27] <Parf> and all the birds were killed many years ago
[02:04:28] <[itchyjunk]> Not saying aliens

[02:05:11] <Parf> they're only just letting us out of the dark ages
[02:05:26] <raincomplex> sometimes i suspect there's a whole culture going on in the sky that we're totally oblivious to. and i'm referring to plain birds and their plain bird languages(?)
[02:05:26] <lucky> that little bugger swooped  in and *stole the knife* from the scene of a suspected robbery
[02:05:38] <Parf> did he really? that's beast

[02:06:07] <Parf> the other day, i was echolocated like a fist to the jaw by an owl around a corner in the middle of the night,
[02:06:25] <Parf> he swooped right out in front of my car after, if i hadn't slowed down just before, feeling the whoosh, i would have hit him

[08:39:43] <biys> i also find that the more i start to see the flaws in my mind the more crazy i'm becoming
[08:40:26] <biys> i'll give you an example.  driving down the road minding my own business and someone cuts me off in traffic.  this instance is only but the most mild inconvenience, yet it does provoke a certain line of tihnking
[08:40:40] <biys> how/where did i determine this to be the most acceptable way to respond or react to the situation?
[08:48:35] <lalia> Maintaining a balanced mental space is brutal, no doubt about it.

[19:42:21] <lalia> The soil in eastern Wa is exceptionally rich, our crops were plentiful and very flavorful. Really enjoyable experience.
[19:44:07] <lalia> Though I did learn a family of four probably only needs four snow pea plants for a whole season of veges for everyone. We planted twelve and had sevral pounds of extra peas in the end.

[19:58:58] <Parf> might have to grow some snow peas
[20:00:56] <pussipupu> Ah! mangetout
[20:01:19] <pussipupu> peas are great in general, I hope we get lots
[20:01:40] <audrey> I have to remind myself there *are* states in the US where cannabis growth is legal LOL
[20:01:48] <audrey> sadly those states tend to also be the most expensive
[20:02:15] <audrey> weird how that works ... the bluer a state is, the higher the cost of living, by and large. With maybe a few exceptions like New Hampshire.
[20:02:21] <audrey> Probably has to do with the urban/rural political divide.
[20:03:05] <bougyman> Colorado cost of living isn't too high.
[20:03:11] <bougyman> Nevada definitely not.
[20:03:12] <pussipupu> I wouldn't be surprised if it were legalised here sometime, but probably not before the next general election
[20:03:40] <bougyman> And Oklahoma? Super low.
[20:03:40] <lalia> Absolutely! The cost of living in weed-legal states tends to be a bit of a nightmare. National legalization would be ideal right about now.
[20:04:14] <lalia> Kinda depends on the legislation too.
[20:04:41] <lalia> Some places require you to have a permit to grow cannabis even tho the state has legalized purchasing and consumption.
[20:09:25] <audrey> My ideal state is one with (pulls up bucket list)... low income taxes, lax homeschooling laws, low levels of drug prohibition, cost-of-living equal to national average or lower
[20:09:43] <audrey> Not sure such a state exists, though.
[20:11:07] <audrey> I moved state last year and owed several thousand dollars in additional state income tax even though my income is *lower* than it was when I was in my previous state
[20:11:15] <audrey> Was not fun at all.

[20:11:55] <audrey> Alaska fits the bill for everything except cost of living.
