[00:01:58] <tomreyn> Surkow|laptop: i'd expect it to say "within [some higher value than 800Mhz] and 2.50 Ghz". i think you still have a firmware or hardware issue there.
[00:02:17] <Surkow|laptop> my hardware issue is that I'll need to repaste the cpu ;)
[00:02:25] <Surkow|laptop> it gets quite hot
[00:02:33] <Surkow|laptop> and endured a bunch of thermal shutdowns already
[00:02:42] <tomreyn> "stuck at 800 MHz" seems to be a rather common search term for this dell model
[00:02:44] <Surkow|laptop> 800mhz has kept it nice and cool
[00:02:57] <Surkow|laptop> but recent chrome updates (and even firefox) make it unbearable
[00:03:19] <Surkow|laptop> it's like they rely on some kind of rendering pipeline that pegs the cpu all the time
[00:03:54] <Surkow|laptop> Yeah, I have found numerous topics where people suggest altering grub flags to disable the bios interfering with the frequency
[00:04:22] <Surkow|laptop> but now that the security pin is present in the power supply I suppose the bios doesn't trigger anything anymore
[00:04:37] <tomreyn> when you have thermal shutdowns happening that also means something is wrong in hardware (or firmware). concentrate on this. if you know it's the need to apply new thermal paste, do it.
[00:04:51] <Surkow|laptop> It's an old laptop with bad cooling

[00:05:36] <Surkow|laptop> figured I'd throw it in the ubuntu channel to see if there was anyone knowledgeable about cpu scaling
[00:06:45] <Surkow|laptop> I apparently don't understand enough about why the cpu keeps getting throttled and why the frequency takes so long to change.

[00:10:43] <tomreyn> chances are the exhauster is jammed and paste is gone.
[00:11:19] <tomreyn> and then the cpu will be less powerful now than it used to be due to the need to fix some of the cpu security vulnerabilities
[00:11:51] <Surkow|laptop> true, I've already repasted its brother, an xps 13 with a more modern first generation i7
[00:12:01] <Surkow|laptop> so I'm aware where the hardware part of the problem lies
[00:12:31] <Surkow|laptop> I cleaned out the whole laptop from dust and debris already and I use an external fan to keep it cool
[00:12:42] <Surkow|laptop> I'll join the hardware channel just in case
[00:12:49] <tomreyn> 1st gen i7 is not more modern, it's less close to the dinosaurs
[00:12:53] <Surkow|laptop> :D
[00:13:04] <Surkow|laptop> I had the third generation model as well
[00:13:19] <Surkow|laptop> sent it back due to hardware issues

[00:27:53] <knaccc> hi all, i'm finding this question surprisingly hard to google: will a rotational hard drive be able to tell if there is a bad sector/other read error simply by reading that part of the disk?

[00:28:13] <knaccc> or will it just silently deliver bad data?

[00:31:57] <knaccc> shibboleth that will tell me if the disk has reported bad sectors, but i'm wondering how the disk can tell in the first place whether there was a bad sector
[00:32:25] <knaccc> from what i've found so far, i think maybe it can only tell a bad sector immediately after an attempted write operation, but cannot just tell from reading a sector written a long time ago
[00:32:49] <tomreyn> knaccc: if you were looking to have a scientific discussion or examination on the topic, this is probably not the place. there is #hardware, but i would not say it matches the scientific part either.

[08:25:15] <leftyfb> lupi: if you want to be able to resolve local hostnames on your network then your clients should be using ONLY your routers ip address as DNS (or local DNS server if you have one)

[08:25:38] <leftyfb> lupi: yes
[08:25:39] <alkisg> pagnol: inside setup, try to disable secure boot, in case something went wrong with that. But unfortunately you'll most probably need a live cd.
[08:25:54] <leftyfb> lupi: then let your router forward DNS requests out to whatever public DNS server you have configured on the WAN side
[08:26:11] <pagnol> alkisg: I will try that thank you
[08:26:45] <lupi> I tried "nslookup myhostname 192.168.1.1" and it did not work. It said "server can't find myhostname: NXDOMAIN"
[08:27:08] <lupi> Also, I thought it would work since I can ping from the host's. "ping myvm" works
[08:28:05] <pagnol> alkisg: secure boot is actually disabled already
[08:28:07] <leftyfb> lupi: your VM software probably setup it's own DNS lookup for guests locally
[08:28:49] <leftyfb> lupi: if your router isn't resolving local hostnames, that is something you'll have to address with your router. Maybe try #hardware or #networking

[08:34:00] <leftyfb> alkisg: all home routers have local DNS built in.
[08:34:02] <lupi> alkisg I thought smb and nmb will handle it altogether already
[08:34:18] <leftyfb> lupi: samba is not for DNS

[08:35:53] <leftyfb> alkisg: also, not everything supports zeroconf and winbind is a poor substitute for DNS

[08:36:38] <lupi> also, "wins support" is enabled in smb.conf if that helps
[08:36:58] <alkisg> leftyfb: DNS means A records. Cheap routers don't have an interface for that, and users don't go to that interface to declare their clients anyway. SOME dhcp clients can send the local hostname when doing a DHCP request, and SOME dhcp servers may accept it.
[08:37:22] <leftyfb> :/
[08:37:43] <alkisg> So in SOME cases the local router will know the hostnames, but this isn't always the case. Avahi and winbind were invented to address the lack of DNS in such LANs

[10:12:22] <alkisg> So in my case, real ubuntu with real windows works; in your case, vm ubuntu with vm windows would work; yet vm <=> real doesn't work in any case
[10:13:37] <alkisg> That's with the default name resolution, which is zeroconf. Note that if your router supports dhcp name registrations, then you should be able to do what leftyfb said,
[10:13:37] <alkisg> although you reported that `host name 192.168.1.1` didn't work, so it either doesn't support dhcp registrations at all, or it's not enabled

[10:16:41] <alkisg> There might be a workaround to make virtualbox NOT drop the multicasted traffic, but it would require asking in #vbox... if it was not problematic it would be enabled by default, so I'm not sure it's worth exploring...

[22:50:39] <webchat33> Hi,
[22:50:40] <webchat33> I'm trying to boot to an ubuntu 20.04 bootable usb and install it with encryption, but for some reason it only gets allocated 2.2gb RAM on startup and this isn't enough for the encryption to generate the keys. Why is this? This is on a lenovo Y700 5ISK in case that helps. The windows partition seems to get allocated 11.8/12GB, so why no the
[22:50:40] <webchat33> bootable USB? I've tried to google all over and can't find the reason for this?

[22:54:34] <alkisg> No I mean in the dialog that you see

[23:05:39] <webchat33> While fixing it, I remember messing about with a whole bunch of commands I can't remmeber cause it was over two months ago, but I think one might've done something to one of the EFI partitions on the 128GB SSD, and I don't know if that could be the issue.
[23:05:52] <alkisg> webchat33: funny, it detects two ram modules, one 4 GB and one 8 GB, and yet it doesn't see/use all the ram
[23:06:20] <alkisg> The disk shouldn't affect at all how much RAM the live USB stick sees
[23:06:37] <alkisg> Can you test for BIOS updates?
[23:06:52] <alkisg> Also, can you test with 21.04, which has a newer kernel?
[23:07:09] <webchat33> I already updated my bios to try to fix it, i'm using the latest bios availiable from the lenovo website
[23:07:16] <webchat33> i can try do that yes
[23:07:16] <alkisg> You're using kernel 5.8, maybe the bug you see has been fixed in the newer kernel 5.11
[23:07:54] <webchat33> I managed to install 18.04 without this issue though?

[23:31:58] <alkisg> I've never heard of it, but I wonder, is it possible that windows suspend keeps some data in ram, and marks it in the firmware as reserved?
[23:32:32] <alkisg> Try to reboot windows, not power it off
[23:32:39] <TJ-> alkisg: it's an attractive theory but I cannot think how/why - it'd have to be a suspend-to-RAM of some form. But then resume would be into Windows

[23:33:26] <webchat33> ok, but if I reboot, it just boots to windows, i guess i'll have to change the boot order in the bios so that it tries something else before windows is rebooted, one sec
[23:33:42] <TJ-> webchat33: most Lenovo's you hold down the power button for about 5 seconds to force it off, then let go. On my E495 I have to press the power button for about 3 seconds to power it on
[23:34:00] <webchat33> Yes, the last time I exited windows, that's how I turned it off
[23:34:03] <TJ-> webchat33: you should be able to press F10 (I think) to get to the manual boot menu
[23:34:19] <TJ-> or is it F8? I can never remember!
[23:34:29] <webchat33> I usually just stick a pin in this hole on the side of the laptop, and it gives me options to go into bios, choose what to boot from, or go into recovery
[23:34:38] <webchat33> i think it's called "novo button"
[23:34:44] <goddard> gnome really needs a way to set default sound device

[23:38:45] <TJ-> webchat33: got a question for you. How can the PC only have 12GiB RAM when it has only 2 DIMM slots - it'd be 2x4GiB or 2x8GiB surely?

[23:40:08] <webchat33> alkisg yes, the last time i think was dualboot 18.04 (which is now gone, because when I tried to install 20.04 using encryption and set up encrypted volume, it went ahead and formatted that partitiion (it's fine cause I had everything backed up))
[23:40:18] <TJ-> on these laptops the slots in dual-rank need matched modules
[23:40:44] <Qetzlcoatl> TJ-: my laptop, for example, has 12GiB - 4GiB onboard + 8 GiB DIMM
[23:40:45] <alkisg> webchat33: when you say "everything backed up", do you also mean the OS, could we check the contents and see the kernel version that you were using?

[23:57:08] <TJ-> goddard: is the Bluetooth device near powerful 2.4GHz wifi or other devices? it could be the frequency band is saturated and overpowering the bluetooth link
[23:57:13] <faceface> bash-completion is already the newest version (1:2.10-1ubuntu1).
[23:57:19] <TJ-> goddard: I've also seen that with failing bluetooth battery levels

[23:57:55] <TJ-> webchat33: cold start should result in all settings being cleared although it is sometimes next to impossible on laptops with integrated batteries - no guarantee it is really 'off'

[23:59:32] <goddard> i just disabled my wifi hopefully that prevents it
