At first he nourished his desire by seeking out people with wooden legs, but as
[02:12:18] <feepbot> he grew older, the desire became self-sustaining. "It has been precisely in these last years that the desire has gotten stronger, so strong that I can no longer control it but am completely controlled by it."

[02:12:23] <feepbot> to be an amputee, fantasizing about photographs of war victims. He was convinced that his happiness depended on getting an amputation.

[04:55:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, the protagonist is Zdim, a demon summoned to the Prime Plane (i.e., the mortal world) for a period of indentured service. He's not very knowledgeable about human affairs and generally kind of a bumbler, and at one point he finds himself captured by a sort of Robin Hood-esque fellow, named Aithor, and his merry band of robbers; and, said Aithor being talkative, they get into a discussion about the local political system:

[06:13:01] <pompolic> for example: instead of going with the popular narrative of "get a degree in law, medicine or science", i noticed they teach CS practically 4free compared to those
[06:13:33] <rmmh> yes, law medicine and science are all much more painful ways to turn IQ into money than CS
[06:13:57] <pompolic> moreover instead of spending ~4 years worrying about admission scores (which were not public until after the fact) i noticed i could look at historical data and extrapolate
[06:14:18] <rmmh> law might be the funniest, with its bimodal salary distribution
[06:15:02] <pompolic> as for how often i admit to having been wrong, well, not often enough
[06:15:11] <pompolic> got a bit of baggage around it
[06:15:22] <rmmh> admitting to yourself is the first step
[06:15:47] <pompolic> in any case, i remember saying at around 15, "i like being proven wrong because it implies that i learned better" or something like that
[06:16:13] <pompolic> so to tie it back to the original point: i think this is evidence for having gained at least some epistemic skill just from grinding away at it
[06:17:00] <pompolic> that said i did happen to read the Jargon File at around 15, so maybe it's in fact a bit of both
[06:17:47] <rmmh> remember when broadcasting PII as feature vectors was cool with 'nerd code' etc
[06:18:24] <pompolic> now the browser does it for you
[06:18:30] <adiabatic> remember when the nerd code was relevant
[06:18:35] <adiabatic> I mean, _doom_. c'mon.

[06:18:49] <pompolic> people should decompose people into basis vectors more imho
[06:19:04] <pompolic> something i don't like about "holding a meme"
[06:19:05] <Urchin[emacs]> blah blah
[06:19:12] <pompolic> i don't think holding a meme is thought
[06:19:18] <pompolic> i don't think spreading a meme is thought
[06:19:31] <Urchin[emacs]> adiabatic: IIRC, it's geek code
[06:19:34] <pompolic> maybe it's social cognition but i don't think it's individual cognition

[06:21:35] <pompolic> thinking back to the jargon file example
[06:21:49] <pompolic> is "saying mu" a meme?
[06:22:00] <adiabatic> pompolic: not really
[06:22:14] <pompolic> "if you encounter a question like <reference class>, say mu" <- i'd say this is a meme
[06:23:01] <pompolic> i really want to distinguish between "inert" information and memes as tiny programs, but i don't think I'm allowed
[06:23:03] <adiabatic> when people ask "is 'saying mu' a meme?", in my circles, that's another way of saying "Do people say 'mu' very much at all?"
[06:23:11] <pompolic> given that it's very easy to make something turing complete by accident
[06:23:30] <pompolic> right. here it was a query about category membership
[06:23:47] <pompolic> to try to set up a distinction between "information" and "meme"
[06:25:04] <pompolic> and the correct answer to the question is prrrrrrobably "lol" followed by linking https://www.gwern.net/Turing-complete

[06:26:04] <pompolic> force of habit
[06:26:05] <rmmh> but I go with a rather broad 'a meme is any information that encourages its own spread'
[06:26:25] <pompolic> yeah i think that's for all intents and purposes an acceptable definition imo
[06:26:57] <rmmh> which effectively all advice and skills fall under
[06:27:14] <pompolic> but secretly i'm still trying to answer adiabatic's question about whether what i was describing was skill or holding a meme
[06:27:17] <pompolic> right
[06:27:30] <adiabatic> pompolic: are ya winnin', son?
[06:27:51] <pompolic> i think we just discovered that those two are the same

[06:33:10] <adiabatic> my bullshit detector works OK for people who have bad and wrong political opinions, but it doesn't always work for more banal topics
[06:33:13] <pompolic> my epistemic skills are probably in the form of cached knowledge about arrangements of such shapes
[06:33:24] <rmmh> 8087 took ~100 cycles to do a multiply, operated at 4-10MHz https://www2.math.uni-wuppertal.de/~fpf/Uebungen/GdR-SS02/opcode_f.html
[06:33:27] <Robomot> 80x87 Instruction Set (8087 - Pentium)
[06:34:03] <rmmh> so that 50kflop number is accurate for multiplies
[06:34:18] <gwern> rmmh: but is that 32fp? since 32fp is half-precision on an a100 that would be the required comparison
[06:34:23] <pompolic> i'd argue that this is more "skill" developed from mashing the shapes against each other and seeing what happens, than caching a meme
[06:35:02] <gwern> one could also argue that they wouldn't know half-precision works well and if they were using full 64fp they were just necessarily wrong...
[06:35:42] <pompolic> a concrete example i can give is that causal reasoning looks like a literal chain of conceptual nodes
[06:35:56] <pompolic> and when someone doesn't give a reasoning the chain terminates abruptly and i get frustrated
[06:36:48] <pompolic> especially if i'm lacking the background knowledge the other person is assuming we have (in which case it makes sense not to put that in there)

[07:50:46] <saturn2> i mean i can't imagine who else would care if you ordered tea
[07:51:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: What's interesting, really, is that it's not quite clear how it's even *supposed to* work. The cooling coils are in the freezer; there's a fan that pulls cold air over the coils, and a branching air pipe that delivers it out to both the freezer and the fridge. So... clearly, the temp control can only control *both* the fridge and freezer, right...? (Indeed the control is going to be strictly more direct on the freezer
[07:51:03] <Obormot\Arcturus>  temp than the fridge temp...) So is the thermostat meant go off the fridge temp, or what? But if so, can't you have a situation where the freezer is too warm to... freeze, in order for the fridge to be at temp...
[07:51:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whole design seems very odd to me and I have a hard time seeing how it could possibly deliver the user experience that anyone might intuitively expect from a fridge temperature control
[07:51:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I vaguely remember Don Norman mentioning this in his book actually...)
[07:55:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> http://blog.etundra.com/tech-talk/refrigeration-thermostatscold-controls-work/ ... this page says:

[07:55:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The first step to understanding how refrigeration thermostats (aka cold controls) work is to understand a counter-intuitive fact about refrigeration physics:
[07:55:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Cooling is achieved by sensing and removing warm air, not by adding cool air."
[07:55:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... but this is exactly the opposite of what I observe?
[07:56:53] <saturn2> mine has a thermostat in the fridge, the cold air gets blown into the freezer, and there's an adjustable valve that restricts airflow from the freezer to the fridge
[07:57:25] <saturn2> so the thermostat controls the fridge temperature and the air valve controls the freezer temperature
[07:58:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is there 1 control knob or 2?
[07:58:09] <saturn2> 2
[07:58:52] <Obormot\Gaia> I have 1 knob and no valve
[07:59:07] <saturn2> "Cooling is achieved by sensing and removing warm air, not by adding cool air" this seems like a confused or not even wrong statement
[08:00:13] <saturn2> equal amounts of air are added and removed simultaneously, otherwise your fridge would become pressurized inside
[08:00:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pretty much all the explanations I'm finding are about 2-knob systems like the one you describe
[08:02:18] <saturn2> i guess it sounds like your fridge has a fixed difference between freezer and fridge temp, and also your thermostat is broken and stuck at a very cold setting

When a winning side didn‚Äôt expect to hold the territory, and feared leaving the vanquished to recover then retaliate, their remaining options were death or slavery. But slaves were only valuable when delivered to a useable location. So the worse treatment of slaves has been in transit immediately after capture.
[09:25:00] <shawwwn> this was a great paragraph, and then the last sentence is gibberish. or my brain is gibberish.

[09:40:55] <shawwwn> saturn2: would it be fair to characterize the article's conclusions as "this article predicts ~10% ems enslavement?"
[09:41:43] <shawwwn> assuming you read it. I often don't read the things I point others to, so don't worry about it.
[09:42:43] <shawwwn> I was just figuring out how to present it. perhaps "but this article predicts otherwise" is close enough.
[09:47:59] <shawwwn> there seems to be a logic error
[09:48:09] <shawwwn> it may be true that <10% of people were slaves, historically
[09:48:33] <shawwwn> but it's not true that 10% enslavement was proportional to 10% GDP output
[09:49:36] <shawwwn> in other words, slaves were valuable, otherwise people would kill them rather than enslave them. They were disproportionately more valuable than non-slaves, otherwise they would just pay non-slaves.
[09:49:42] <saturn2> no i wouldn't say that
[09:51:59] <saturn2> he thinks that the present decline in slavery will continue with ems
[09:52:17] <shawwwn> yes. but why?
[09:52:28] <shawwwn> there didn't seem to be an argument
[09:53:00] <shawwwn> the conclusion was "I see no reason why ems slavery would be 100%" while pointing to historical enslavement rates
[09:53:08] <shawwwn> unless I fail at reading
[09:53:18] <shawwwn> which is possible, particularly now
[09:53:22] <saturn2> Today slavery, especially full control slavery, is discouraged not only via moral censure and political coordination, but also by stronger nation-states, few wars, better credit markets, increasing wealth, increasing vulnerability to sabotage, more automation, and more complex jobs. The only contrary factors I can think of are easier monitoring and preventing escape. If all these trends continue in the
[09:53:24] <saturn2> same relative proportions, we should expect a continued decline in slavery.
[09:53:26] <saturn2> In the world of my book, The Age of Em, many of these trends continue. Nation-states and credit markets get stronger, and war remains rare. Automation advances, and jobs get even more complex, with motivation and sabotage mattering even more. Monitoring and preventing escape also get easier.
[09:54:37] <saturn2> that's the argument, pretty much
[09:55:57] <saturn2> the last few paragraphs are him poking holes in his own argument, rather than a traditional conclusion
[09:57:21] <shawwwn> ah. I thought I was going nuts, because the whole time I was thinking "...but every one of those arguments relies on the idea that an ems is approximately a person. An em isn't a person. People are made of blood, not electricity. They require food, move around, and take up space."
[09:57:50] <shawwwn> the article doesn't seem to address that at all
[09:58:18] <shawwwn> it's essentially "but history" and nothing else
[09:59:15] <saturn2> well, robin hanson wouldn't agree with that either
[10:00:50] <saturn2> he thinks ems ought to be considered people and given legal rights
[10:11:33] <rsaarelm> That sort of assumes that things work like "what we philosophically figure should be right -> spacetime pattern of such-and-such characteristics gets considered a person" rather than "result of a complex tug-of-war of path-dependent material conditions and constraints that evolve as the environment changes and new technologies are developed -> spacetime pattern of such-and-such characteristics
[10:11:36] <rsaarelm> gets considered a person"
[10:14:31] <saturn2> he thinks the material conditions are such that ems will have rights
[10:15:20] <saturn2> because it will be more economically efficient if they make their own choices in response to price signals
[10:17:04] <rsaarelm> I'll never get tired of the bit where the guy who coined "the dismal science" did so because economics was saying that slavery is inefficient.

[13:00:07] <shawwwn> once I started thinking in terms of effective purchases, it became a bit easier to judge things like that. You're effectively purchasing an asset (academia) at a price equal to the opportunity cost of not leaving.

[13:29:03] <saturn2> why would they give the AI to a random shareholder

[13:31:32] <kuudes> because we are stupid
[13:31:47] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, because the company charter says anyone can publicly burn x shares for a 50% chance of 2 shares ex nihilo. 
[13:31:48] <kuudes> ey is not ok with it
[13:31:58] <PlanckWalk> I'm not okay with it
[13:32:03] <feep> kuudes: different way to put it: you cannot trade in a currency on the abolishment of that currency
[13:32:15] <PlanckWalk> But if I go blow them up they'll call me a terrorist.

[13:32:30] <nshepperd2> idk about OpenAI specifically but safe AGI is pretty much the only antidote to unsafe AGI

[13:33:25] <feep> either you have no reason to take it, or your counterparty doesn't

[13:35:21] <feep> yes
[13:35:37] <feep> again, we are betting on the destruction of said currency.
[13:35:37] <nshepperd2> our species is too stupid for all seven billion people to effectively cooperate in "nobody builds AGI ever" so building safe AGI that takes over the world first seems like the only practical option
[13:35:48] <kuudes> yes, if you have equal priors, there is not bet to be made
[13:35:53] <feep> no even so
[13:37:06] <feep> anyway, trade is not a matter of priors but divergent preferences, the point here is that nobody has a translation between money and preference in the bet-on outcome, so there cannot be a disagreement on outcome valuation in that case
[13:37:29] <Gurkenglas> feep, if no AGI you pay money. if AGI you get money iff money is not obsolete, divided by the probability that money wouldn't become obsolete, as judged by the AGI
[13:37:46] <feep> what sort of lame-ass agi doesn't obsolete money
[13:38:08] <Gurkenglas> the agi might aggregate preferences in a way that still allows people to bargain with one another
[13:38:20] <feep> I            guessss
[13:38:58] <nshepperd2> you can trade in the abolishment of the currency. the pro-abolishment side just needs to receive their winnings now, instead of afterwards
[13:39:05] <Gurkenglas> money would be a standin for "if after foom the agi listens to me some way and to you some way, i'll tell it to listen to you some more"
[13:39:09] <nshepperd2> and that's the bet that EY and whoever it was actually made

[14:31:32] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm trying it right now
[14:31:47] <feep> what was that law, "easiest way to find out how to do X is confidently assert it cannot be done"
[14:31:54] <nshepperd> would be nicer if git init did the right thing and made an empty root commit which is the same for all repos
[14:32:11] <feep> cunningham's law
[14:32:18] <feep> nshepperd: yeah I did that manually in my case
[14:32:25] <feep> nshepperd: or rather, I rebased off the initial commit of the first repo
[14:32:31] <PapuaHardyNet> "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"
[14:32:32] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: you may want to do that too
[14:32:35] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah no git doesn't allow it
[14:32:52] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: --allow-unrelated-histories
[14:33:11] <PapuaHardyNet> this is incredible
[14:33:14] <feep> ^^
[14:33:51] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: anyway, you may want to do the rebasing thing too, gonna make it easier to merge changes from the other repo in the future
[14:34:27] <feep> ie. check out the first commit of the first repo, branch off a commit that deletes everything, then check out the 0xdeadbeef, rebase onto the delete-everything commit, then merge the result into your original master
[14:34:41] <feep> git is just graph theory, what's the problem
[14:36:00] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I did make SRS flashcards for this, so thank you. but I already deleted one repository and manually copied files onto the second one, therefore losing history. meh
[14:36:13] <saturn2> fun fact: --allow-unrelated-histories was added because someone wrote a linux driver in an empty repo on github and got it merged, so now linux permanently has 2 initial root commits
[14:36:48] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: lol
[14:36:56] <feep> well, now we know tho.

[18:57:26] <gwern> ...to discover that they are now required to use kiosks... 3 of 4 of which are broken. the 4th has a long line, naturally, and it's clear using it to e-order takes way longer than normal ordering would. they blame some sort of computer problem for the downtime and need to use a kiosk -_-. so they skip on *that* too and hold out for a quite nice local restaurant on the way. they show up and...
[18:57:32] <gwern> ...turns out, there's a party of *50* people there. and... *3* waiters. so the waiters are running to and fro with drinks, and meals are going to random tables, asking who ordered this? (did *you* order this?) eventually they get their appetizers... along with the dinner, rather defeating the point of 'appetizers'. but at least after all this, the food was still good. (Which is not to be...

In new documentary Beatles Stories, Seaman tells filmmaker Seth Swirsky Lennon wasn't the peace-loving militant fans thought he was while he was his assistant.

Reagan was the guy who had ordered the National Guard, I believe, to go after the young (peace) demonstrators in Berkeley, so I think that John maybe forgot about that...

[22:40:58] <kuudes> wait, what did PapuaHardyNet say?
[22:41:15] <Gurkenglas> 75% of global civilizational collapse this century iirc, just a few supply shocks
[22:41:30] <kuudes> eh
[22:42:03] <kuudes> just because a country which has got into hyperinflation and had a near-nuke explosion is tumbling, does not predict much of the rest
[22:42:51] <Urchin[emacs]> no
[22:42:52] <Gurkenglas> i agree and i didnt put it above 5% and still don't but he still would have predicted this more than i would have :P
[22:43:33] <Urchin[emacs]> afaik, we're still tracking limits to growth business as usual
[22:43:44] <Gurkenglas> *looks around* and my 12-story elevator hasn't been working for 10 days now
[22:45:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> This year my building super started turning off the elevator in the evening (turning it back on early in the morning) because some miscreants were going down to the basement to do drugs there
[22:48:34] <Gurkenglas> make it take 5$ at night, redistribute them to inhabitants
[22:50:18] <kuudes> hmm, so they are residents who go to do drugs? or nonresidents have access to your elevator at night?
[22:53:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Residents, I am pretty sure
[22:55:42] <rmmh> is that legal??
[22:56:13] <kuudes> sounds odd to prevent/inconvenient residents leaving at night
[22:56:42] <RiversHaveWings> Obormot\Arcturus: What. Why can they not do drugs in their apartments.
[22:57:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: Is what legal
[22:57:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> RiversHaveWings: Oh, you know... live with parents/spouses/whatever... who even knows
[22:58:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or maybe they want to shoot up with their friends and don't want to invite to apts
[22:58:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't really know tbh
[22:58:32] <mst> "meeting in a neutral space" is a thing anyway
[22:59:48] <saturn2> kuudes: the problem with risk is that you might lose something, if you wouldn't even notice what you might lose you aren't taking much risk
[23:00:10] <kuudes> saturn2, hmm
[23:00:32] <kuudes> why is that bad?
[23:00:54] <Gurkenglas> What was that (EY?) story about the demon race who pretend to buy your soul for fun?

[23:04:43] <kuudes> am I? why?
[23:04:57] <kuudes> if I believe the market is right in 999/1000 times?
[23:05:48] <kuudes> what's the kelly here?
[23:07:24] <saturn2> you should probably not be trading at all (unless you get significantly more than 1000x if you're right)
[23:07:59] <kuudes> yes, I am trying to find those 1000:1 bets for that 1/1000
[23:08:25] <kuudes> I am not betting to buy apple instead of microsoft with buying AAPL
[23:08:53] <kuudes> I want to bet to buy option that costs 0.01 and is worth 100.00 in case index drops to <50% before next summer etc
[23:09:28] <kuudes> so I think index funds decide better than myself if microsoft or apple is better stock
[23:09:49] <kuudes> but I presume I might as a smart person and aspiring rationalist to have an edge in weird edge bets
[23:11:20] <kuudes> does this make sense?
[23:11:41] <kuudes> I presume people who get paid on it likely have better understanding than I have on constant day-to-day trades
[23:12:03] <kuudes> but I also presume that as an aspiring rationalist I might note smoke when most people won't at least act on it

[23:13:35] <saturn2> i see
[23:17:47] <saturn2> now i think you are very risk-seeking, if you are really wrong 999 times out of 1000
[23:19:16] <kuudes> :D
[23:19:26] <kuudes> yes, I think the combination is what I seek
[23:19:49] <saturn2> expected case is that you lose 63% of your wealth before hitting one of these
[23:20:01] <kuudes> hmm. how so?
[23:20:24] <saturn2> 1-(999/1000)^1000
[23:20:46] <kuudes> ok
[23:20:52] <kuudes> of the 1/1000 that is?
[23:21:56] <saturn2> if you risk losing 1/1000 of your wealth 1000 times
[23:22:44] <kuudes> how does the 999/1000 that is invested in market behaves at that time?
[23:23:46] <saturn2> what do you mean?
[23:24:06] <kuudes> I mean, I have 999/1000 invested in market while I take 1/1000 and invest that to fringe bets
[23:24:19] <saturn2> however it behaves, you end up with 63% less than you would have had
[23:25:53] <saturn2> (your 999/1000 seems unlikely to be well-calibrated though)
[23:26:06] <kuudes> if I have 1000.00 at start and I put 999.00 to market and 1.00 to fringe bets, indeed as you say I seem to expect to get 1.00 -> 0.63 + 10000 and 999 -> ?, therefore 10000+0.63+?
[23:26:44] <kuudes> or well, 0.63 + 6300 + ?
[23:26:59] <kuudes> oh, what would be a better calibration?
[23:28:07] <saturn2> i don't know
[23:28:14] <kuudes> me neither
[23:28:40] <kuudes> I agree I am likely wrong, but I am curious if I could be less wrong
[23:29:25] <saturn2> how many times has your opinion contradicted the market so far?
[23:30:27] *** Joins: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice)
[23:30:37] <kuudes> I think less than 10 times. I should get more active
[23:31:02] <saturn2> have you been wrong every time?
[23:31:18] <kuudes> ~yes
[23:31:52] <kuudes> maybe twice I was sort of right but the rules were changed somehow so that I was wrong, so I had inadequate priors on rule changes
[23:33:11] <kuudes> then there have been a couple of borderline misses, ie that my theory what was going on was correct but the end result did not end up to the bet won -square
[23:34:09] <kuudes> I guess one could count my minor btc as being correct, though I see it more as part of the index distribution
[23:34:45] <saturn2> wait so you only bet 1/1000 of your 1/1000 pool each time? so 1/1000000 of your total wealth?
[23:35:07] <kuudes> no, I bet some hundreds some times. I am not very rich
[23:35:57] <saturn2> then your 1.00 -> 0.63 is not right
[23:36:00] <kuudes> I have not done this for very long. but I have noticed I have had a couple of times a less wrong world model than people I have explained a thing to, but I have not bet on outcome
[23:36:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> yorick: ... lol. "We haven't solved this bug in 18 years, therefore it's probably not relevant anymore - CLOSED!" 
[23:36:39] <kuudes> basicly I have grown more confident that maybe I should sometimes bet on how I believe and not default 100% the market being correct
[23:36:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> yorick: Mozilla devs, man
[23:37:13] <saturn2> kuudes: that sounds reasonable
[23:37:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The original bug report was from a user running Windows 2000. 2000!!)

[23:38:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Mozilla approach to problem-solving: just wait literal decades, then don't solve the problem. Genius imo
[23:39:03] <saturn2> kuudes: sure
[23:39:58] <Urchin[emacs]> make a system simple enough that it has no obvious flaws, or make a system complex enough that it has no obvious flaws...
[23:44:40] <saturn2> kuudes: but with ootm options you lose everything if you're wrong, so it.s 1.0 -> 0.0 and then you have to put another 1.0 in
[23:44:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Urchin[emacs]: The Mozilla approach is "make a system complex enough that it has plenty of obvious flaws but they can't be fixed"
[23:45:17] <saturn2> or another 0.999 i suppose
[23:48:21] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: even if mozilla were well-managed they probably don't have the resources to keep up with chrome and also work through their enormous bug backlog
[23:51:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yes, well, that hardly seems like any excuse to compound misfortune with mismanagement...
[23:51:37] <ivan> options are kind of annoying unless they're a long-term thesis (weeks-months), or you day trade, or have software to adjust your prices
[23:51:56] <ivan> often better to have a lot of money and buy underlying if you can
[23:53:11] <ivan> selling your option for the most $$$ will require staring at the chart intently and doing so before volatility crashes
[23:53:18] <ivan> s/will/may/
[23:56:35] <ivan> there can also be liquidity issues because options turn one underlying ticker into tens - thousands of different strikes-expirations
