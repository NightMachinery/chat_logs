[12:00:15] <pussipupu> Lumine: kiitos
[12:00:47] <pussipupu> not as often as I should, partly because I need a better computer for the design side
[12:01:04] * arryana nods
[12:01:16] <arryana> i toy with the idea of getting one, but i don't know how often i would actually use it
[12:08:22] <Lumine> I'm in the process of getting a new computer as well, my current one is getting old, and I can't do the kind of images I currently do fully. 3D landscapes when you start populating them with trees it quickly becomes a situation when the render times grow exponentially to the point where the program crashes. Also, my 3D painting program has the same problem, it crashes often with particular brushes at high resolutions

You had to majorly restrict yourself because at the same time the tech which was used in their creation wasn't as optimised for them as they are now. One could be rendering literally for days for a simple image that now takes couple of hours.

[12:55:09] <Delf> Lots of dreams, that's a good sign I suppose. But still, wouldn't hurt to get your hormones checked
[12:55:27] <amigojapan> Ok Delf
[12:55:36] <Lumine> Specifically, if you had large enough paper and enough energy, if you fold a paper in half exactly 103 times, the thickness would exceed the observable universe. With just 51 times, the thickness would reach the sun. Now, maybe someone with some math skills can confirm this because I only have bits and pieces of it from internet articles but that's the gist of it.
[12:56:22] <amigojapan> I've heard that before Lumine
[12:56:26] <inhahe_> it's easy, just multiply the width of one sheet times 2^n where n is the number of folds
[12:56:41] <arryana> haha
[12:56:46] <inhahe_> each time you fold the paper the thickness doubles
[12:57:40] <arryana> isn't there a limit to how many times a piece of paper can be folded?
[12:57:44] <arryana> 8 or something?
[12:58:03] <inhahe_> yeah, you can't really fold a paper 103 times
[12:58:22] <arryana> i remember something about that from elementary school.
[12:58:25] <Lumine> Yes but I said enough energy, it's hypothetical
[12:58:35] <Lumine> You can't really do that
[12:58:36] <arryana> also when we learned how to cut a small piece of paper into a hole a person can jump through
[13:02:14] <Lumine> I've got a ton of these in my memory. Like... Guess what the most powerful explosion in the universe is if discount the Big Bang? Hint: it's not a supernova
[13:02:49] <arryana> i have no idea
[13:03:34] <amigojapan> Lumine: also a piece of paper gets smaller in the X and Y directions when you fold it
[13:03:55] <Lumine> amigojapan: i said large enough paper
[13:04:11] <amigojapan> Ah ok Lumine
[13:04:40] <Lumine> Anyway, the answer to my previous question was: Gamma Ray bursts. They are so powerful you can see their light in the entire universe.

[13:37:52] <Lumine> When scientists pointed the Large Telescope Array in the sky recently, they discovered something startling that confounded all explanation. A hole of some 1 billion lightyears in diameter was found which doesn't have galaxies, or stars and has a noticeable lack of dark matter inside it. It defies even the natural evolution of the universe. They simply don't know how it got there. Source: space.com

[14:02:53] <amigojapan> I don't think so inhahe_ the quote bot in the anime channel is completely random but people complain it is usually giving out the same quotes. Similar thing happened in apples shuffle algorithm for songs in iTunes
[14:03:06] <Lumine> It basically states that our models of the universe will always be inaccurate and incomplete.
[14:03:09] <Delf> Completely random?
[14:03:33] <amigojapan> Delf: it's an rng
[14:03:49] <Delf> That's an accurate theorem
[14:04:15] <arryana> i very much doubt it's empty
[14:04:21] <Delf> Does that actually make it completely random?
[14:04:22] <arryana> i suspect it's full of something we don't have tools to see
[14:04:36] <Delf> Fields that're not in our fimsical realm
[14:04:44] <amigojapan> Delf: pseudo random
[14:04:45] <Delf> Flimisicallity :P
[14:05:16] <Lumine> That's not a word
[14:05:42] <Delf> amigojapan: So it's something that is supposed to be random, so that is why we have that notion. It would be inaccurate to use such notions to describe other things
[14:05:59] <Delf> Physical. You know what I mean
[14:06:51] <Delf> I don't endorse the use of drugs but... I might be addicted to coffee.
[14:07:21] <Lumine> Best addiction in the world
[14:07:23] <amigojapan> Delf: I am addicted to coffee too
[14:08:05] <amigojapan> My wife had me drink black coffee today cause we ran out of creme
[14:08:18] <inhahe_>  amigojapan: if those things are happening often, then by definition they're not very unlikely. or, if they're theoretically unlikely, then something you don't understand is behind them
[14:09:02] <amigojapan> inhahe_: or unlikely things are just common
[14:09:32] <inhahe_> if they're unlikely, they're not common, or there's something you don't understand which made you think they should be unlikely.
[14:09:57] <inhahe_> it depends on how unlikely they are of course
[14:10:13] <Delf> amigojapan: That's not good for the teeth
[14:10:18] <inhahe_> it also depends on how many different things you're looking at
[14:10:23] <inhahe_> in the case of the CMB, it's only one
[14:10:28] <amigojapan> inhahe_: things that appear unlikely to humans*are actually common
[14:10:32] <Delf> Add tiny little amounts of baking soda :P
[14:10:47] <inhahe_> amigojapan: then the humans understanding is incorrect
[14:11:42] <amigojapan> Agreed inhahe_
[14:12:18] <amigojapan> inhahe_: human intuition is often wrong
[14:13:26] <Delf> It depends on what the intuition is based on. Many times we can go to idiot lengths of trying to force things to be the way our intuition says so we'll start hunting for evidence
[14:14:13] <Delf> And sometimes... you just don't fucking like someone and you don't know why so you give them the benefit of doubt and later, by accident you find out they're total assholes that shouldn't even be around
[14:17:12] <Lumine> arryana: I think you're right. But I have this funny notion that the more we look into the explanation for something, there will always be something out of reach about it. The mystery. If we knew everything about the universe and had a complete and clear picture, I suspect that we would come to a standstill. There would be in other words no surprises left.
[14:17:48] <Delf> I am compelled to disagree. There is inner universe
[14:18:00] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[14:18:08] <amigojapan> Lumine: the universe is full of surprises
[14:18:17] <Lumine> Yeah, something we don't know
[14:18:48] <Delf> Not saying stupid is out there (the universe) and the smarts in here (inside us) but there is probably a little of both in both things
[14:19:03] <amigojapan> Lumine: what we do know must be like a drop of water in an ocean of what we don't know
[14:19:49] <Delf> In an ocean of what we don't know... That makes what we know even less than imaginable
[14:20:52] <Lumine> Yes, and my point is that there will always be that ocean, as was arryana's point. There will always be something that is yet to be discovered. Because if there wasn't, there would be nothing happening. That's my personal theory.
[14:20:56] <arryana> thing is, it isn't like we have good enough senses to see or hear most of what goes on on this planet
[14:21:29] <Delf> Agreed
[14:21:36] <arryana> birds can follow magnetic lines, dolphins can hear across water for amazing distances, birds of prey see enormously further than we can
[14:21:47] <amigojapan> Lumine: well it would be boring to know everything
[14:21:51] <arryana> many animals can sense earthquakes coming
[14:21:57] <Lumine> Exactly amigojapan
[14:22:31] <Delf> How the hell do you consider yourself fit to make such belief?
[14:22:42] <Lumine> Who?

[14:23:40] <Delf> If I tried, my brainballs would run down my nose and ears. I don't know how you manage
[14:24:18] <Delf> But we don't know that, given we don't know everything. There could be something we could look forward to, if we knew about it
[14:24:40] <inhahe_> i think this conversation about knowing everything is missing the fact that there's a distinction between knowing the principles/rules behind everything and knowing the specific data
[14:25:24] <amigojapan> inhahe_: but we don't know that either
[14:25:30] <Delf> There is that also. Knowing the rules doesn't mean you know EXACTLY how it'll play out, might be still tooo many variables for you to account for
[14:25:53] <Lumine> As I said to arryana once, I know everything. *laughs*
[14:26:01] <Delf> Why not just implode not knowing onto itself

[14:32:44] <Delf> No not that
[14:32:58] <amigojapan> Ok what do you mean
[14:33:05] <Delf> I meant the technological singularity
[14:33:42] <inhahe_> amigojapan: I agree (re "humans are very arrogant, so we start to believe we even know the principals about everything")
[14:33:56] <inhahe_> I doubt it's even possible to know the principles about everything.
[14:34:00] <amigojapan> Ty inhahe_
[14:34:39] <Delf> Wtf... you thank him for agreeing, but not me? I feel left out now... :(
[14:35:08] <amigojapan> Delf: you are getting too emotional
[14:35:26] <Lumine> Emotions are prohibited!
[14:35:36] <amigojapan> I did not mean to be ungreatful
[14:35:54] <Delf> amigojapan: Relax mate, you're correct. That would be getting too emotional
[14:36:09] <Delf> It's already give, that we agree on many things.
[14:36:19] <Lumine> arryana: my plate for the first commission is almost complete, the base for the painting I mean
[14:36:40] <amigojapan> Nice Lumine
[14:36:40] <Delf> Lumine: No they're not! I can't pretend to be human without htem
[14:37:12] <amigojapan> I think he was joking Delf
[14:37:18] <Lumine> I was
[14:37:20] <Delf> I know they are
[14:37:34] <amigojapan> Ok
[14:37:59] <Delf> Emotions is a nice quality btw, very fascinating subject. One of my fields of interest
[14:38:29] <Lumine> By the way, I'm glad that my article sparked such a discussion about what we really know
[14:38:46] <amigojapan> Emotions are a double edged sword. Partly good partly bad
[14:38:49] <Delf> So am I
[14:39:24] <Delf> amigojapan: Exactly. To add on top of that, double edged sword, cloaked as a shield
[14:39:29] <amigojapan> Rationality can be overdone too
[14:40:14] <amigojapan> We need a healthy balance of rationality and emotion
[14:40:45] <Delf> Interesting... but those two are not opposites of each other
[14:40:56] <amigojapan> Lumine: I am glad we are taking about philosophy at all
[14:41:36] <inhahe_>  my current theory is that for some people rationality and emotion work against each other, for others they can be integrated
[14:42:07] <Delf> That is consequence of lack of honesty with oneself
[14:42:10] <amigojapan> inhahe_: yeah I agree
[14:42:33] <inhahe_> Delf: can you elaborate?
[14:42:40] <inhahe_> or give examples?
[14:43:25] <Delf> Actually, it's more the lack of inner work rather than honesty but honesty is mandatory, for working with oneself
[14:44:13] <amigojapan> inhahe_: I am one of the ones that think they can be integrated.
[14:44:40] <Delf> The rational values they have are not in alignment with the values of their emotions. Sometimes, they are in alignment and that too can cause problems
[14:45:14] <amigojapan> inhahe_: I notice many people tend to say "I am a rational person."and negate their emotional side
[14:46:10] <Delf> They're emotional values can be too primal as to go against their own rational values and then they have emotional problems
[14:46:14] <inhahe_> delf i think another problem is that emotions tend to group things together that should be kept separate
[14:46:56] <Delf> There is that of course. Our pattern recognition for avoiding things or reaching for things can prevent us from actually discovery new things, instead we think we're seeing the same thing over and over
[14:47:36] <inhahe_> i think that's different from what i'm talking about but it's hard to explain
[14:47:45] <Delf> Emotions have the advantage of being fast compared to rational
[14:48:30] <Delf> There is what one believes vs what one values. Those two hare hardly ever in alignment
[14:48:44] <Delf> This alone can cause tremendous internal conflict
[14:49:50] * arryana returns with a new ball of yarn and laughs at lumine's comment
[14:50:10] <Delf> When people come to me with emotional problems, I just allow them to spill their guts and I try to determine the conflict and problem and I try to determine whether or not they also see it. I don't do much at all... they pull themselves together all by themselves, rebuilding
[14:50:18] <Lumine> arryana: :)
[14:50:31] <Delf> I call it... calibrating identity with values
[14:51:06] <amigojapan> Delf: so you just listen?
[14:51:49] <Delf> No, I nudge them into asking questions or I ask the questions directly. Questions that are of paramount importance
[14:52:06] <amigojapan> I see
[14:52:26] <Delf> Some doors you open them... that's them doing the asking. Some doors, you got to kick the door open, that's you asking the question
[14:53:13] <arryana> why would anyone trust your answers or your questions when you lie to amuse yourself?
[14:53:16] <Lumine> I usually just turn on the handle and open the door
[14:53:19] <Delf> This practice is dangerous when dealing with malicious people btw. I will not advise it
[14:53:47] <amigojapan> Lol Lumine
[14:54:07] <Delf> Where's the fun in that? Too easy... and elegant :P
[14:55:05] <Delf> Neither requires trust, arryana. Some people notice that despite them being assholes, I'm still willing to offer a helping hand.
[14:55:45] <arryana> they'd be idiots to value any answers from a self proclaimed liar
[14:56:37] <arryana> they'd be better off getting their guidance from a magic 8 ball
[14:56:55] <Delf> Why so harsh?
[14:57:16] <arryana> it's not harsh, it's just true
[14:58:17] <Delf> Alright then. But I have no intention to provoke or irritate you. Taking into account the lack of value my words have, I would strongly suggest you put me on the ignore list, permanently
[14:59:08] <arryana> there's no reason to /ignore you.  nor am i insulting you, you freely admitted yesterday that you lie when you feel like it.
[14:59:14] <amigojapan> Delf: I am already in her ignore list for a long time
[14:59:59] <arryana> if my input offends you, perhaps it's you who should /ignore me.
[15:00:27] <Delf> Hmm..
[15:02:05] <kevin-oculus> so guys we have goverment invesment on public transport if you want to take bus or train you have to pay for ticket now they increased ticket fee if you want to take bus to go to city it costs from 3$ to 4$ is it expensive we already pay tax to the govverment
[15:02:19] <Delf> I've never ignored you, arryana. Even when you've asked questions and I've avoided answering, I've still read your questions and comments
[15:03:16] <amigojapan> kevin-oculus: hard to control what the government does
[15:03:19] <Delf> amigojapan: How? Help a brother out!
[15:04:00] <amigojapan> How what? Delf how to get ignored by arryana ?
[15:04:16] <Delf> Yes
[15:05:25] <amigojapan> Delf: I found that she was fine with talking about random stuff. But whenever we discussed philosophy age did not like it. And eventually just put me on ignore
[15:05:47] <amigojapan> She did not like it*
[15:07:01] <Delf> I see... There is probably something else at work behind the scene
[15:07:13] <amigojapan> Strange she inhabits this channel
[15:07:30] <kevin-oculus> amigojapan yes but it seems that goverment tryes to make profit right

[15:08:54] <kevin-oculus> amigojapan yes but its dirty business when we already pay taxes we should have public transport free nothing to pay
[15:09:08] <amigojapan> kevin-oculus: they have pressure from the top to make it profitable
[15:09:19] <Delf> She's usually doing other things simultaneously instead of just idly waiting for something interesting and she appreciates the company and probably the topics and subjects as she does have a great deal to share which is nice indeed
[15:09:29] <amigojapan> kevin-oculus: yeah we should
[15:10:01] <Delf> Why does people seem to think that I am pretending to be benevolent when I've already, on multiple occasions state that I am MALEVOLENT, and benevolent.... !?
[15:10:07] <Ungwelian> I've been ignored by arryana too :)
[15:10:33] <Ungwelian> The reason was that I told her she should be nicer to someone. Forgot who the nick was.
[15:10:48] <amigojapan> Ungwelian: welcome to the club :)
[15:11:16] <Ungwelian> Heh yeah. An auspicious league of esteemed people :P
[15:11:16] <Delf> Fuck tolerance mate, we aint doing that shit here. That's for the weak
[15:11:20] *** Trieste_ is now known as Trieste
[15:12:37] <inhahe_> tolerance is humanitarian/compassionate and greater-good oriented. I hate when people mistake caring and good will for weakness.
[15:12:39] <Delf> We have no idea what assholes she's had to put up with and who may have reminded her of the kind
[15:12:58] * Ungwelian shrugs
[15:13:33] <amigojapan> kevin-oculus: they can also rise the tax, they have been doing that here
[15:14:12] <kevin-oculus> amigojapan oh so they can do both rise the tax and rise the bus ticket fee
[15:14:23] <Delf> Communication and cooperation is essential, not optional. Causing conflict is not good. Actual attempts at trying to solve conflicts and prevent them from happening is also nice. But then you have some assholes who would rather conflict with you and they don't give a fuck about what you think, they just want to mess with you and those.. you got to "deal" with
[15:14:29] <amigojapan> Yup kevin-oculus
[15:14:46] <kevin-oculus> amigojapan where in japan
[15:15:49] <Ungwelian> People can go several ways with assholes. One is to adopt it and become an asshole yourself, another is rejecting it and becoming the opposite.
[15:16:15] <Delf> Hmm... interesting
[15:16:25] <amigojapan> kevin-oculus: nation wide. They recently retired the cunsumtion tax from 5% to 8% and now to 10%
[15:16:34] <Ungwelian> E.g. people with hardline religious upbringing can decide to treat their kids much better.
[15:17:20] <Delf> Ungwelian: The thing with being an assholes is that... it's usually either justified or unjustified, there is trouble in the distinction, the method of telling them apart
[15:17:37] <kevin-oculus> amigojapan oh so its the inflation thing right
[15:18:35] <Delf> Individuals protect themselves from admitting themselves being unjustified assholes by justifying it
[15:18:44] <amigojapan> kevin-oculus: I am not sure what rational they have for it. Tho the commoner does not want it to go up
[15:19:17] <Ungwelian> Yeah, being an asshole is definitely a power trip.
[15:19:29] <Delf> Tell me about it... I fucking love it
[15:20:33] <kevin-oculus> amigojapan so they increased electricity bills, gasoline, now public transport  now you say they increased taxes this year is gone be hard economic year for citizines
[15:20:49] <amigojapan> kevin-oculus: salaries don't follow increased taxation in Japan
[15:21:46] <amigojapan> kevin-oculus: are those public works? In Japan all that, including transport are all privatized
[15:24:59] <Delf> inhahe_: Those that make that mistake have weak values or are morally corrupted. Former or latter, possibly both.
[15:25:06] <kevin-oculus> amigojapan well here in sweden he have salary taxation 33% of salary, we have free healthcare and free schools thats it, public transport is goverment financed and runned by gov but public transport offers choices take your own car or take the bus
[15:26:04] <kevin-oculus> we have
[15:26:47] <amigojapan> kevin-oculus: we have free health care and schools in Japan too
[15:27:04] <amigojapan> Oops
[15:27:31] <amigojapan> kevin-oculus: not free healthcare. The government pays 70%
[15:28:24] <Delf> kevin-oculus: It's not free mate. If we're fucking paying for it already, it's not free.

[15:41:54] <Rashad> For example, the color of a wedding dress is irrational (or let's say "non-rational"), but washing your hands before eating is
[15:42:40] <biys> let me, if i may
[15:42:42] <biys> is it like....
[15:42:43] <Rashad> The Arabic language is largely irrational (in that sense), since it doesn't matter say what language Newton wrote his books originally in.
[15:43:12] <biys> slaughtering an animal to pay homage to some distant idea is irrational
[15:43:15] <amigojapan> Rationality is not always right
[15:43:28] <biys> would you say  that is accurate?
[15:43:53] <biys> i think paul treanor says it best
[15:43:56] <biys> lemme find the quote
[15:44:17] <Rashad> So I would be sad if everyone started using English as their day-to-day language here as a result of modernization (because I like the Arabic language) but it is largely an irrational issue.
[15:44:18] *** Trieste_ is now known as Trieste
[15:44:29] <biys> Nation-states are by definition oriented to the past. The nation is a transgenerational community, but only the past generations can serve as a cultural reference. No-one knows where their future descendants will live, or what culture they will have. But they do know about their ancestors, their ancestral homeland, and and their ancestral culture - even if only a mythological version. By default, the pas
[15:44:35] <biys> t culture becomes the national culture. Preservation and protection are typical of the nation-state, innovation is not. This obsession with the past might be harmless in an individual, but nationalists make it a function of state - and so the nation-state becomes an obstacle to innovation. That is a prime justification for its abolition.
[15:44:43] <biys> i think the "idea" of those cultural references
[15:44:47] <biys> is the "tradition" i talk about
[15:44:53] <Rashad> The modernization typically is set to address the rational parts, which is why I am willing to accept the irrational changes.
[15:44:57] <biys> where it really has no significance but it's place in the past
[15:45:11] <biys> but i still think that the ``bond'' that is created as a result of that comonality is.... definitely worth mentioning
[15:45:16] <Rashad> This means: Less religious fanaticism, more economic freedom, less war and less death, etc.
[15:45:24] <biys> sure
[15:45:46] <Rashad> I am using rational and irrational here in kinda different ways.
[15:45:58] <biys> i get what you're saying i think though
[15:46:08] <Rashad> Rational -- can be right or wrong, Irrational -- cannot be right or wrong.
[15:46:16] <biys> your rationality is based in pragmatism
[15:46:26] <Rashad> No no it's just because I don't know another word...
[15:46:34] <Rashad> Carl Jung also used it this way.
[15:46:39] <biys> i'm pretty sure i understand what you're saying
[15:47:10] <Rashad> So yeah just to give you a taste of what how it is,
[15:47:23] <amigojapan> Even the most illogical people think they are logical
[15:47:42] <Rashad> in the 60s and 70s almost every adult Arab had some political affiliation, whether it is Islamism or Nationalism or Sectarianism, etc.
[15:47:47] <biys> i'd say that all nationalists are be definition racist
[15:48:11] <Rashad> Today the youth is much less political, and, most of all, cannot even name any of those factions.
[15:48:31] <biys> but they still uphold particular ideas that have been indoctrinated into them by the society and those that make up the society
[15:48:45] <biys> the origins of those ideas/concepts are likely just loosening
[15:48:50] <Rashad> Today it is just capitalism vs islamism...
[15:48:51] <biys> they are still present within the population to some extent
[15:49:14] <biys> capitalism in the sense of marketing and consuming
[15:49:16] <biys> no?
[15:49:28] <Rashad> biys Both nationalists and racists are collectivists.
[15:49:37] <Rashad> Well, maybe in the general case...
[15:49:53] <biys> i'm fine with it
[15:49:56] <Rashad> There was one racist American scientist who was an individualist...
[15:49:59] <biys> to each their own
[15:50:14] <amigojapan> Rashad: how is Islamism uncapitaliatic?
[15:50:16] <Rashad> He believed the "inferior" races should be encouraged not to reproduce, but be given full rights.
[15:50:34] <biys> how did they define inferior?
[15:50:48] <biys> cause i think that is what's promoted in this channel frequently
[15:50:49] <Rashad> Somehow biologically but I don't remember.
[15:51:22] <amigojapan> Sounds like nazis
[15:51:24] <Rashad> biys Capitalism in the sense of more free economics
[15:51:29] <biys> in the western world people aren't necessarily looked at if they procreate without an appropriate level of fitness
[15:51:41] <Rashad> More trade deals, less restrictions from the public sector, etc
[15:51:44] <biys> you're looked at as "not responsible" if you have kids without having a reasonable career first, for example
[15:52:10] <Rashad> biys Well that is a good thing
[15:52:11] <biys> s/looked at/looked at nicely/
[15:52:11] <ro-bot-o> biys meant to say: you're looked at nicely as "not responsible" if you have kids without having a reasonable career first, for example
[15:52:32] <amigojapan> Ok I am being ignored good bye
[15:52:38] <biys> hi amigojapan
[15:52:40] <biys> <3
[15:52:49] <amigojapan> Hi biys
[15:53:03] <biys> Rashad: free economic
[15:53:05] <Rashad> hey amigojapan
[15:53:06] <biys> you mean a free market?
[15:53:12] <Rashad> I am so sorry but I am a little slow today
[15:53:12] <biys> ooh
[15:53:14] <Rashad> :(
[15:53:16] <biys> neoliberalism
[15:53:20] <biys> is what it sounds like you're suggesting
[15:53:21] <Rashad> let me catch up amigojapan one sec
[15:53:21] <amigojapan> Hey Rashad
[15:53:28] <Rashad> There are 3 of you only one of me :D
[15:53:29] <arryana> i'm curious, rashad, do you think women should have equal rights to education and such?
[15:53:36] <biys> Rashad: how free is your free market?  do you have any monopolies?  any unions?
[15:54:20] <Rashad> amigojapan By Islamism here I mean largely political thought with the end goal of reviving the Khalifate (what ISIS claimed it did)
[15:54:33] <Rashad> arryana Yeah
[15:54:38] * arryana nods
[15:55:01] <Rashad> biys You mean my idea of a free market or the actual reality in the pro-US Middle East?
[15:55:21] <biys> the actual reality of the pro-US middle east HAH
[15:55:25] <biys> cause...
[15:55:29] <amigojapan> Rashad: then you probably don't mean "capitalism"is an opposite of Islamism if the idea is not economic
[15:55:35] <Rashad> arryana But I am against XY and XX people competing in the same sports (most of the time)
[15:55:50] <Rashad> arryana Because although men and women are equal intellectually, they are not equal physically
[15:56:09] *** Joins: Fohsap_ (~Muimi@2001:19f0:6001:5706:5400:3ff:feb7:9796)
[15:56:22] <biys> is there any conflicts with neolib/capitalist society and the followers of the god of abraham?
[15:56:47] <Rashad> A solution I propose is that instead of making two versions of the sport one for "men" and the other for "women", instead we make the two based on objective physical measurements
[15:57:09] <Rashad> Since now "men" and "women" mean more than XX and XY...
[15:57:15] <Rashad> (To many people anyway)
[15:57:27] <Rashad> amigojapan Yes that's true.
[15:57:35] <Rashad> amigojapan But this is the political landscape...
[15:57:50] <Rashad> I can't say Secularists vs Islamists because this is not the case on the ground.
[15:57:56] *** Fohsap_ is now known as Fohsap
[15:58:05] <Rashad> Secularists are gone too, like say Marxists, etc.
[15:58:32] <Rashad> There remains some, but mostly the youth has no active interest in such things, and more importantly in any history of it from the last century.
[15:58:47] <biys> really?
[15:58:51] <Rashad> In the 80s all that remained was the pro-US "capitalists" and the Islamists.
[15:59:20] <biys> so uh
[15:59:37] <biys> would the Islamists live on an island if they could do you think?
[15:59:42] <biys> is that analogy making sense?
[15:59:58] <biys> or do t hey want us to live on an islan?
[15:59:59] <biys> island
[16:00:03] <Rashad> biys In 10 years I will know more about US politics in the 60s and 70s than I do about the same in Jordan my country
[16:00:08] <Rashad> If not today already.
[16:00:10] <amigojapan> Rashad: I recommend you look for a different term than "capitalist"for a political stance. This is also why people confuse and think China is not a capitalist nation
[16:00:38] <biys> Rashad: i'm fine with your explaination
[16:00:46] <biys> i understood the context
[16:00:49] <amigojapan> Rashad: maybe you mean "democracy"?
[16:01:01] <Rashad> All the past got wiped out... and with it some of the old stuff, like the lack of any real poet for so long now
[16:01:11] <biys> yah
[16:01:16] <Rashad> amigojapan Yeah that's very true.
[16:01:25] <Rashad> amigojapan Let me put it this way: Dick Cheney-ism
[16:01:27] <biys> to me it's a shame that the culture/heritage is being eroded at the rate it is
[16:01:31] <Rashad> Or Reaganism
[16:01:35] <biys> without it entirely being documented/understood
[16:01:48] <biys> like for example the american aboriginals had oral teachings/traditions
[16:01:52] <biys> a lot of it is gone
[16:01:53] <amigojapan> I see Rashad
[16:02:07] <biys> cause the oral word died with those that knew it
[16:02:18] <Rashad> Yeah exactly.
[16:02:37] <biys> an as a result of globohomo/neolib/colonailism whatever you wanna call it/them.... the capitalists
[16:02:42] <mannequin> +++
[16:02:43] <mannequin> +
[16:02:44] <Rashad> Consider that I only very recently (maybe a year or two ago) learned about the connection between Syria's Ba'ath party and Iraq's.
[16:03:14] <mannequin> oops
[16:03:20] <arryana> don't you think it's the internet and entertainment which has as much to do with the spreading of english as anything else?
[16:03:30] <biys> ^ god no
[16:04:23] <Rashad> So yeah if poetry is stagnant now, that is sad, but if it means less war, less fanaticism, etc, then mayyybe it is a good thing.
[16:04:40] <biys> i'd say to some extent the interpretations of others media into your own has gone on as long as we've had written medium
[16:04:52] <biys> but that still doesn't mean t hat nations haven't held their traditions/heritages as necessary
[16:05:06] <Rashad> However I say this with something in mind... all this will mean nothing unless there is a point where the pro-US governments turn into liberal democracies....
[16:05:10] <biys> the erosion of the major religions has been happening steadily now
[16:05:18] <biys> i would go as far as to say it's methodic
[16:05:33] <Rashad> King of Jordan in the past couple of years has been saying clearly that that is what he wants to do... but we still are to see any real results.
[16:05:41] <biys> "liberal democracies" hah
[16:05:44] <biys> but yes
[16:05:47] <biys> you're right, i agree
[16:05:58] <Rashad> The constitution got modified like a month or so ago, but the "free two-party-system elections" are yet to come.
[16:06:17] <Rashad> This is the end game and I hope the dictators know it.
[16:06:31] <biys> "the dictators"
[16:06:37] <biys> but yes, i understand what you're saying
[16:06:50] <Rashad> Certainly in Jordan there is an awareness of it -- there is no alternative to just giving up power to the people.
[16:07:05] <biys> ultimately the peopel do have power
[16:07:12] <biys> they're justa llowing themselves to live under some conditions
[16:07:23] <biys> your traditionalism is still strong enough
[16:07:41] <Rashad> biys Any kind of democracy can eliminate this in one generation, I believe.
[16:07:59] <Rashad> Look at Japan or South Korea...
[16:08:09] <biys> i don't necessarily think it's a good thing
[16:08:15] <biys> but you're right i presume
[16:08:25] <Rashad> The only traditionalism that can remain is traditionalist people who will have an equal vote.
[16:08:38] <Rashad> And in one generation they will become just conservatives.
[16:08:44] <biys> can't throw the baby out with the bath water
[16:09:08] <Rashad> If nobody is forced to vote in one way or the other, and the election is fair, then all it takes is to just say no to the other side and get on with your life.
[16:09:55] <Rashad> And this is the end game because there is no advantage in holding up power unless you are some sort of maniac.
[16:10:19] <biys> sounds idealistic
[16:10:21] <biys> but sure
[16:10:28] <Rashad> Just become a symbolic monarch with some powers and spend your time vacationing around the world.
[16:10:32] <biys> the problem with that idea, i think anyways, is people have a desire for power
[16:10:46] <biys> and i think it's not really possible to make everything potentially void of problems
[16:10:51] <Rashad> You'll still get some of that without all of the headaches.
[16:10:52] <biys> there's always going to be a way to exploit a system
[16:11:21] <biys> and with that, you will have peopel exploiting the system in some way or anothert
[16:11:26] <biys> to attain some kind of status
[16:11:36] <biys> i think it's more-so the ideas surrounding "worth" that's the problem
[16:11:46] <biys> and some peopel do believe they're worth more than others
[16:11:57] <biys> we're taught and told we're "special"
[16:12:00] <biys> but i digress
[16:12:02] *** Joins: emmeka (~emmeka@162-251-198-66.dynamic.parolink.net)
[16:12:06] <biys> i think you're idealistic
[16:12:09] <biys> but i understand what you're saying
[16:12:54] <Rashad> Well I am a big fan of the French and American revolutions...
[16:13:01] <Rashad> The enlightenment and those things.
[16:13:15] <biys> when framed in such a way it's all really glamorous
[16:13:48] <Rashad> And besides it does seem to work empirically... wherever it is tried, democracy lifts up the standard of living, etc.
[16:14:22] <Rashad> But it's not idealistic in the sense that I worship democracy as a God it's just that I selfishly want a better life :D
[16:14:24] <biys> it becomes a question of end goal
[16:14:40] <biys> and what direction your want to point yourself
[16:14:42] <Rashad> End goal is to be free to do what I want regardless of what other people think.
[16:14:45] <biys> as you navigate through time and space
[16:15:11] <biys> 'eh
[16:15:15] <biys> "free"
[16:15:24] <Rashad> Yeah what's wrong with that?
[16:15:35] <Rashad> Also where are you from maybe we can trade citizenships :D
[16:15:35] <biys> i don't feel very free
[16:15:46] <biys> Rashad: that is likely true th ough
[16:15:50] <biys> i get that
[16:16:00] <biys> the trading of citizenships
[16:16:07] <biys> and the point you're making
[16:16:42] <biys> i'd say it's like a prison
[16:16:48] <Rashad> For women and homosexuals it can be a million times worse in the middle east.
[16:17:22] <Rashad> Imagine not being able to live away from your family as an adult woman even in a country like Jordan.
[16:17:42] <Rashad> A woman living alone is very suspect and very shameful here.
[16:18:00] <biys> why?
[16:18:05] <Rashad> Unless there is a reason for it, you only get to live in your parents' house or your husband's house.
[16:18:07] <biys> i mean... i could see that
[16:18:08] <biys> to some extent
[16:18:13] <biys> the degeneracy
[16:18:21] <biys> same goes with guys though
[16:18:27] <biys> "Swipe lyfe!"
[16:18:39] <Rashad> If a woman is living alone, who is there to watch that she is wearing her veil all the time and/or is not having sex outside marriage...
[16:18:49] <biys> no one
[16:19:16] <Rashad> And homosexuals have no rights whatsoever..
[16:19:26] <biys> what rights are they lacking would you say?
[16:19:31] <Rashad> Heh
[16:19:40] <biys> if i own a store and a homosexual wants to buy something frmo me... can i refuse them service?
[16:19:48] <Rashad> If you're a lesbian, your parents can legally force you to marry a male.
[16:20:07] <Rashad> And all homosexuals are not accepted as such in any way.
[16:20:27] <Rashad> If you dare tell anyone, the response you will get is to cure yourself.
[16:20:33] <biys> so there's still an expectation that you procreate?
[16:20:52] <Rashad> I don't consider being serviced by a private individual or business a right...
[16:21:03] <biys> can you get married and not have kids?
[16:21:13] <biys> a normal hetero couple
[16:21:16] <biys> "normal"
[16:21:19] <biys> beg your pardon
[16:21:25] <Rashad> Legally yes. In the eyes of society, mostly no.
[16:21:51] <Rashad> Your parents will always push you to make them happy by bringing them grandchildren because since they created you they own your life.
[16:21:52] <biys> nothing you say sounds outlandish to me
[16:22:29] <biys> so when you say "free" do you really mean sans-responsibilities?
[16:23:10] <biys> i can see the reasoning behind the traditions generally speaking
[16:23:24] <biys> and i don't necessarily consider them invalid unless we look at the world through a particular lens
[16:23:32] <Rashad> In the case of a homosexual free to form homosexual relationships, as an example.
[16:23:44] <biys> free to what extent?
[16:23:58] <biys> what particular portion are they deprived from?
[16:24:02] <Rashad> Free from all "responsibilities" that one did not explicitly enter into.
[16:24:18] <Rashad> Free from a contract you signed? No. Free from religious bullying? Yes.
[16:24:34] <biys> can't th row the baby out with the bath water
[16:24:45] <Rashad> What do you mean?
[16:25:18] <biys> i'll call you Rodion
[16:25:25] <biys> Rodion Raskolnikov
[16:25:31] <arryana> i wonder how many heterosexual men would tolerate being forced into a homosexual relationship
[16:25:40] <Rashad> Not familiar.
[16:25:49] <Rashad> arryana Yeah :D
[16:26:17] <Rashad> If you're a homosexual in Saudi Arabia your life is basically ruined...
[16:26:28] <arryana> i've heard that before
[16:26:29] <biys> what do you mean "basically ruined" ?
[16:26:32] <arryana> seems a shame
[16:26:40] <Rashad> Many apply for asylum and I hope they all do.
[16:26:52] <arryana> i don't know why it should be anyone's business what genitals someone has or what they do with them, so long as there's mutual consent
[16:26:56] <biys> what things are they deprived of?
[16:27:07] <Rashad> biys Try living your everyday life pretending that you're something you're not.
[16:27:21] <Rashad> biys Not being able to defend your ideas in public when they are being attacked.
[16:27:22] <biys> i do that!
[16:27:27] <biys> that too
[16:27:44] <Rashad> Not being able to confide in a therapist.
[16:27:53] <biys> nor would i.  yikes
[16:27:56] <biys> imagine the condemnation!
[16:28:04] <Rashad> Not being able to seek sexual or romantic relationships
[16:28:17] <biys> idk what that means
[16:28:21] <Rashad> Well you're weird :)
[16:28:21] <biys> you mean be a whore?
[16:28:22] *** Quits: Keter (~Keter@user/keter) (Quit: Leaving)
[16:28:24] <arryana> personally, i think homophobic men feel the way they do because they're uncomfortable being the unwilling sexual object to someone else.  which is how most women are expected to tolerate feeling.
[16:29:01] <Rashad> arryana That could be a reason, yes.
[16:29:21] <Rashad> There are homosexuals that are homophobic though... religious homophobes, etc.
[16:29:46] <arryana> true enough
[16:29:48] <biys> i would say in a hetero relationship the women have many expectations about the men.  it's more or less how the entire dating world works.  women do look at a mans fitness to determine if they want to procreate with them or not
[16:30:06] <biys> so to suggest that it's only men that are thinking about their best intereste/wanting to have their desires fulfilled
[16:30:09] <biys> it's fucking nonsense
[16:30:20] <Rashad> biys OK let me ask you this:
[16:30:47] <Rashad> Woman X procreates with Man Y.
[16:31:11] <Rashad> biys Does this mean she did that after looking at Y's fitness, etc?
[16:31:22] <biys> definitely
[16:31:24] <Rashad> OK.
[16:31:33] <Rashad> Does this determine the man's fitness?
[16:31:49] <biys> it could play a role
[16:31:57] <Rashad> Or could X be wrong in her determination?
[16:32:19] <biys> regardless if she is right or wrong.  she made a determination about the individuals fitness
[16:32:19] <Rashad> Or I can ask another way: Say all women don't exist anymore... what happens to mens' fitness?
[16:32:32] <biys> regardless what underlying factors were in play that helped her make the determinaion
[16:32:35] <biys> she still made it
[16:32:52] <Rashad> But does that determine the actual fitness of the male?
[16:33:03] <biys> it could play a roll in it, yes
[16:33:09] <Rashad> And if so, what happens when different women reach different conclusions about the same male?
[16:34:03] <biys> lets say that as a result of the significant amount of "pussy" the guy is getting, his self esteem allows him the confidence to take necessary risk increasing his success
[16:34:18] <biys> there's lots of stuff that plays into a person psyche
[16:35:26] <biys> but i would say that a person who is more confident/capable is likely more fit than someone who is not confident/capable
[16:35:38] <biys> that isn't to say you can't be a confident moron though
[16:35:55] <biys> but i think those people would, generally speaking over a longer period of time, become obviously less successful
[16:35:58] <biys> as their not capable
[16:36:13] <biys> so their confidence would likely inhibit their ability to be successful because they're a moron to begin with
[16:36:46] <biys> s/their/they're/
[16:36:46] <ro-bot-o> biys meant to say: so they're confidence would likely inhibit their ability to be successful because they're a moron to begin with
[16:36:51] <biys> wrong one
[16:37:02] <biys> i fucked up a their/they're back there
[16:37:53] <biys> but i'm still wanting to know what aspects of life a homosexual person is deprived of, short a volatile social stigma
[16:38:13] <biys> i could see how the social stigma would be problematic in promoting a resaonable understanding of ones self
[16:38:20] <biys> always being thought of as a "lesser"
[16:38:33] <biys> but i'm more interested in what they're technically deprived of
[16:38:38] <biys> are they allowed to buy food?
[16:39:00] <Rashad> Yeah that's generally not scientific.
[16:39:15] <biys> what isn't?
[16:39:21] <Rashad> All of it.
[16:39:59] <Rashad> Consider making the same statements about any other animal.
[16:40:01] <biys> well sure
[16:40:12] <biys> i mean...  the soul and the mind and the spirit aren't all "scientific"
[16:40:33] <Rashad> Well then one doesn't talk about them.
[16:40:36] <biys> but we are in #philo aren't we?
[16:41:44] <Rashad> Your theory about Homo sapien sexual selection will not (I believe) stand the test of any biology journal.
[16:41:55] <biys> it isn't my theory
[16:42:04] <Rashad> The theory you stated.
[16:42:13] <biys> i can reference lots of literatuer that suggests otherwise
[16:42:32] <biys> but maybe we'll just stop the conversation there
[16:42:52] <Rashad> Yeah I had more to say about it but if you want, sure.
[16:43:09] <biys> say what you like, i'll read it
[16:43:33] <biys> just so i can be sure you're suggesting what i think you're suggesting
[16:43:47] <biys> unless you'd like me to steelman what i think you're saying
[16:44:17] <Rashad> Generally though modeling human beings as a cogs in machine or zombies that do not have conscious thought will lead to so many contradictions.
[16:44:23] <Rashad> People try to do it in economics too.
[16:44:31] <biys> it sounds like you'er suggesting that women don't make a judgement of a mans fitness prior to selecting them as a sexual partner
[16:44:51] <biys> and a mans fitness isn't associated with many things
[16:44:55] <biys> including his perception of himself
[16:45:50] <Rashad> biys Women will do whatever they want and I'd rather ask them than speculate.
[16:46:05] <biys> hahahaha
[16:46:58] <Ungwelian> Oh you people :)
[16:47:25] <biys> here is the simplest example i can give of this
[16:47:35] <biys> audrey and i mentioned it earlier this week
[16:47:51] <biys> it was about how westernized ideals of women are like...
[16:47:54] <Ungwelian> I chose my guy because he is kind, has a good sense of humour and likes Star Trek.
[16:48:06] <biys> way different than, for example, africanized ideals
[16:48:10] <Atque> Rashad: There's 100s of studies on effects from sexual sexual in people.
[16:48:43] <Ungwelian> "Judging his sexual fitness" wasn't even in the first 10 things of what I thought.
[16:48:43] <Rashad> Atque I think there is a typo there.
[16:48:52] <Rashad> Atque Could you please say that again?
[16:48:56] <Atque> Rashad: Are you proposing consciousness meddles with behaviour somehow?
[16:49:35] <Atque> Rashad: Well, your point's flatly wrong. There are 100 of articles about psychological and physical sex differences due to sexual selection in human beings.
[16:49:58] <Rashad> Atque Consciousness exists to regulate behavior.
[16:50:17] <Rashad> What was my point?
[16:50:38] <Rashad> If I had any point it would be this:
[16:51:01] <Rashad> Any model of human-whatever must account for the inherent unpredictability of human beings.
[16:51:18] <biys> i always refer to something like this
[16:51:23] <biys> tornados happen
[16:51:26] <biys> that doesn't make them normal
[16:51:27] <Rashad> If you're model is too good to not account for that, this is generally a sign that it is also too good to be true.
[16:51:33] <Atque> Rashad: Most behaviour has little to no conscious input. And the way you are framing consciousness is deeply problematic. It is as though you are proposing it is a Cartesian homunculus sitting in there controlling the body. That's clearly wrong.
[16:51:40] <Rashad> Human beings are fantastically unpredictable.
[16:52:05] <biys> to some extent
[16:52:14] <Rashad> In fact it is a very good strategy when you are trying to predict human behavior (which is totally fine and totally a good thing) to never *tell* the people that that is what you are doing.
[16:52:18] <biys> not completely across the board
[16:52:27] <Rashad> Never tell them the prediction... it will blow the whole thing up!
[16:52:34] <biys> there are certain predictions that can easily be made about behaviour
[16:52:41] <biys> lots of it
[16:52:42] <Atque> Rashad: No, they're not. People have predictable loops. They turn up to work at specific times of day. They get hungry at specific times etc. Most people's days are very predictable.
[16:53:04] <Rashad> Except when they don't...
[16:53:14] <biys> like i said.  torandos happen
[16:53:16] <biys> they aren't normal
[16:53:51] <Atque> Rashad: Yes. And sometimes in summer it is cold. Your point doesn't establish a difference from a natural phenomena.
[16:54:13] <Rashad> Even the most automatic of human functioning is problematic to predict. Doctors spend a lot of effort trying to predict the future of a human automatic physiology.
[16:54:55] <Rashad> Atque Please predict what I will type next.
[16:55:11] <Rashad> And if you do I will give you all my money.
[16:55:34] <Atque> Rashad: That's wrong. If you blow air into someone's eyes, they tend to blink and so forward. People have strong expectations about how people will behave, and they are usually right. People freak out if you break conventions at supermarkets, in your family dinner etc.
[16:55:49] <Rashad> Except when they are not usually right.
[16:56:00] <Rashad> And except when you blow air into someone's eyes and they don't blink.
[16:56:14] <Rashad> And except when they don't freak out.
[16:56:16] <Rashad> Etc...
[16:56:42] <Atque> Rashad: Yes, because some earlier input provided them to not do. So you can predict it if you have knowledge about that.
[16:57:11] <Rashad> What input?
[16:57:51] <Atque> Rashad: Ironically, your point about predictability in behaviour is very naive. For example, predicting gates in certain experiment in physics is difficult, due to heisennberg's uncertainty principle. But you do not have this problem with psychology.
[16:58:23] <Rashad> What input?
[16:59:13] <Atque> So it is as though you are trying to distinguish between behaviour and natural phenomena by appealing to uncertainty, this already exist in clearly natural phenomena and less so in behaviour.
[17:00:57] <Rashad> With 100% of the input available to your model, what is the success rate of it for predicting human behavior?
[17:01:12] <Rashad> Heisenberg's formulas provide precisely that.
[17:01:18] <Rashad> Now I want to see yours.
[17:02:14] <Rashad> I don't think you have a model at all...
[17:02:41] <Rashad> And that's my point to begin with.
[17:03:11] <biys> Human behavior is 93 percent predictable, a group of leading Northeastern University network scientists recently found. The team's research is published in the current issue of Science magazine. ... ‚ÄúSpontaneous individuals are largely absent from the population.Feb 19, 2010
[17:03:16] <biys> i just asked google
[17:03:18] <biys> google wins
[17:03:18] <Rashad> Now you seem to say that what I stand for is that a model can never be formed.
[17:03:22] <Rashad> We can talk about that.
[17:03:34] <Rashad> But so far what I am saying is that you don't have a model right now.
[17:03:45] <Rashad> So let's be precise here about what we're claiming.
[17:04:00] <biys> ‚ÄúResearchers cannot make predictions about human behavior in the same way a physicist can make predictions in a lab. ... But, in theory, if scientists had all the information about the nature and nurture motivations, we could predict behavior with accuracy.‚Äù

[17:05:30] <Rashad> However I really do think that 93% is OK for a scientist, but if you're in the CIA it will be more like 99%
[17:05:42] <Rashad> I don't think 93% is impressive at all or reliable.
[17:05:43] <inhahe_> People claiming humans are very predictable have tunnel vision and are only focusing on certain predictable aspects/behaviors. Think of the unlikelihood of predicting what someone will say next in this conversation, for example.
[17:05:58] <Rashad> If you're a CEO you should have in your arsenal at least 95% predictability.
[17:06:13] <Rashad> 93% in a controlled environment is quite whacky.

[17:07:31] <biys> i don't think that the people being tested would be aware that the test is about predicting predictability
[17:07:53] <biys> and i don't think the "tell em what i'm going to type next" would be a reasonable research item to test
[17:08:30] <biys> beg your pardon, but it's just such a low-iq position to take
[17:08:35] <Rashad> biys So conscious awareness of test subjects of the facts of the experiment change its outcome?

[17:09:03] <Rashad> biys Never mind I asked you anything...
[17:09:12] <inhahe_> i'm talking about conversation in general, not necessarily conversations where people know someone's attempting to predict them. and if predicting conversation isn't a reasonable research item, that only shows why the wealth of research papers on human predictability doesn't mean much.
[17:09:45] <biys> the test that's reasonable would be more like... having someone "spark up"  aconversation about some particular topic
[17:10:01] <biys> and then determining all the possible avenues that conversation could take
[17:10:12] <biys> you're right.  at any point in time someone could just type giberish!
[17:10:18] <biys> but in the context of the conversation, it's unlikely
[17:10:27] <inhahe_> you don't have to type gibberish to be unpredictable
[17:10:30] <biys> there's only a certain amount of avenues that can be investigated during the conversation of weather
[17:11:02] <inhahe_> most conversations aren't about weather
[17:11:02] <biys> you're right.  it doesn't have to be gibberish

[17:11:56] <biys> a house on mars
[17:12:21] <inhahe_> vaguely being aware of trillions of possibilities isn't the same as predicting though

[17:13:00] <inhahe_> that may be true
[17:13:03] <inhahe_> but doesn't say a lot

[17:16:03] <Rashad> Consciousness performs "evolutionary functions". 1) Because it is very unlikely that something as expensive as consciousness could have evolved without having an "evolutionary function", 2) because mere observation is sufficient to show that consciousness is crucial to the organism's survival.
[17:16:41] <biys> evolutionary functions...
[17:16:52] <biys> so like...  women give birth (generally speaking) and men don't
[17:17:10] <biys> so there has to be some kidn of biological precondition as a result of those two different evolutionary behaviours
[17:17:42] <biys> it's probably has some bearing on a persons psyche as well... or the manifestation of their psyche based on their intersectioanlity anyways
[17:18:30] <Rashad> With organisms that are most likely unconscious (like a bacteria cell), evolution is stuck at biochemical laws that determine the evolutionary outcome of the organism.
[17:18:44] <Rashad> i.e., whether it survives or not, and whether it reproduces or not.
[17:19:11] <biys> so you think humans are born tabula rasa then?

[19:44:58] <audrey> As much as I regret not getting married to my ex, sometimes I wonder if I'd just be trading one kind of misery for another
[19:45:32] <arryana> most paths can be happy or unhappy, and usually are both at times
[19:46:32] <pussipupu> I solved this problem by marrying the best human
[19:46:34] <arryana> you've got a sharp mind and a sharp wit, i suspect you'll be a lot of things before you're done
[19:46:38] <pussipupu> it's easier in the long run
[19:46:45] <arryana> haha, me too
[19:47:36] <audrey> Delf: Family friendly? This is IRC, the words family and friendly aren't in most people's vocabularies her
[19:47:40] <audrey> s/her/here
[19:47:40] <ro-bot-o> audrey meant to say: Delf: Family friendly? This is IRC, the words family and friendly aren't in most people's vocabularies here
[19:47:53] <audrey> (Present company excepted. :)):
[19:48:06] <arryana> haha
[19:48:26] <arryana> nice save
[19:48:31] <Delf> Look, I made a mistake, alright. Will you pull my fucking teeth out for it or just forgive me?
[19:48:49] <audrey> Huh? I'm just having fun. Not criticising you.
[19:48:54] <arryana> wow
[19:48:55] <Lumine> Getting overly emotional again there Delf

[20:03:35] <Delf> Nonsense? Why so harsh?
[20:03:48] <Lumine> I wasn't saying that to you
[20:04:19] <Lumine> More of a general thing
[20:04:21] <Delf> My bad, I take it back
[20:04:48] <arryana> not gonna engage in that level of anyone else's neurosis.
[20:05:30] <Delf> Actually, I think you did very good last time. Maybe there wasn't something deep behind it but it got us into a good direction. I remember we discussed something interesting, just forgot what it was about
[20:07:40] *** Joins: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414)
[20:08:05] <Delf> That's the sane thing to do. I pretend to be.. not stable person but I'm actually very stable. However, there are people that actually aren't stable
[20:08:53] * pussipupu is dynamically unstable
[20:09:35] <arryana> haha
[20:09:59] <Delf> Well... if you want to take into considerations my emotions... I'm dangerous as fuck and I should probably be locked in, for the safety of others and myself. I'd say you're WAY more stable than I am.
[20:11:49] <Delf> However, given my unique approach to myself, I'm very stable and dependable. This is what others recognize in me that's why they share stuff
[20:13:51] <Delf> We all solve issues differently. arryana manages with emotional control for example. I cannot, it's impossible for me so I had to take a different approach

[20:15:22] <biys> audrey: that is exactly how i think of it as well
[20:15:31] <biys> the decisions we make all account for some kind of misery
[20:15:39] <biys> is this decision or that any better or worse?
[20:15:42] <biys> we really can't know
[20:15:58] <biys> all we do fucking know, i'll tell y ou qwat, is that the grass is always greener on the other side
[20:16:53] <Delf> I think the grass is greener where I put my bestest of intentions
[20:17:55] <biys> sometimes my intentions end up not being what i thought
[20:18:00] <biys> i can be greedy
[20:22:22] <Delf> Those, we must stort out mate because intentions are OUR DOMAiN, it's our realm
[20:22:50] <Delf> You don't get to pick what to feel or which emotions to have, but you get to pick which intentions to harbor
[20:23:00] * pussipupu notices repeated use of "mate"
[20:23:16] <Delf> Do you want me to stop using that, I'll do it, I swear
[20:23:27] * pussipupu gets ready for someone to break a bottle
[20:23:38] <Lumine> Sometimes the best intentions invite the worst kinds of trouble. I know this from personal experience. Where I wanted to change a person, and it ended up in blowing in my face. You can't change people by talking them out of it.

[20:24:28] <Delf> How is changing a person the best intention? That's not our domain, that's the person's domain
[20:27:16] <pussipupu> Very stable, very unstable and dangerous, always serious, usually joking
[20:27:26] <pussipupu> Roger
[20:27:46] <Delf> Unstable emotions, not unstable person, there is difference
[20:29:35] <arryana> maybe it's because i'm old, but the idea of changing someone is not anything i'd consider engaging.  if i think someone's too unpleasant or too much of a liability, i just don't deal with them
[20:30:10] <arryana> change is always difficuld, painful, or both, and whoever undertakes it needs to want it and own it themselves.
[20:30:17] <Lumine> arryana: it was about helping them to get rid of a bad habit. I was too full of myself to see that they didn't want to change.
[20:30:27] * arryana nods
[20:30:30] <Delf> Not always, sometimes it can be a sweet relief
[20:30:46] <arryana> caring is hard, especially when you care more than someone else cares about themselves
[20:31:22] <Delf> That's a consequence of seeing value in them that they themselves have yet to see
[20:32:31] <Delf> I have the same approach to the idea and I'm half your age so maybe it's not age

[20:35:23] <pussipupu> Often people do want to change and it's often good to work with them towards that
[20:35:35] <pussipupu> That's very different from trying to impose change on someone though
[20:35:45] <arryana> indeed
[20:35:47] <Delf> Of course, a whole other story
[20:37:25] <Delf> However, unfortunately it's not uncommon that people want to change other people
[20:38:28] <Delf> There was this girl who was being an assholes, towards everyone, and everyone treated her like shit but I didn't so she started to get physical with me
[20:39:04] <pussipupu> *being an asshole
[20:39:19] <pussipupu> ‚Äúassholes‚Äù is plural
[20:39:33] <Delf> Because one can be an asshole in any number of ways

[20:40:41] <arryana> ?
[20:40:42] <Lumine> Well, I don't impose change on anyone, or at least try not to. It was a mutual thing but it became one-sided on my part in the end. Which is a shame.
[20:40:44] <pussipupu> Quintuple...
[20:40:47] <arryana> ahh
[20:41:23] <Delf> Lumine: You tried to help someone who stopped wanting your help. How did it backfire btw, if you don't mind telling
[20:42:42] <arryana> i liked the freedom of being single.  i like the company of being married.  but he's particularly good company

[20:45:00] <Delf> Right. My bad, I have a bad habit of digging into things
[20:46:24] <Delf> So I had to let her know that I'm also harboring a malevolent personality and she literally changed color out of fear... next time I saw her, she was less of an assholes but I don't know if that's because she got scared of me or because she reflected over her behavior
[20:46:33] <Jong> What is science? Isn't it just philosophy + new evidence acquisition by setting up experiments and seeing what happens?
