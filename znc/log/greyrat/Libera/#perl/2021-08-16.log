[00:26:30] <RickSOC> I'm starting a little hobby project for building out an API, I'm intentionally avoiding prebuilt stuff like Mojo, Catalyst, Raisin, etc. because I want to better understand the inner workings of what I'm building
[00:26:47] <RickSOC> API as in a server with a REST interface
[00:27:18] <RickSOC> I'm setup standalone http listeners before but I want to look at some of the more scalable / high performance modules
[00:28:05] <RickSOC> I'm looking at Plack::Handler::Net::Async::HTTP::Server now but the documentation is pretty basic - is this a good starting point for setting up an async listener that uses plack, or is this module more of a quick bandaid to async'ify an existing psgi app?

[03:51:52] <_73> How can I make a destructive update to an array through a subroutine that takes an array reference as an argument? For example when I grab the argument like `my @arr = @{$_[0]}`, and then make some update to @arr, this update is not reflected in the array that was passed after the subroutine returns. Here is some example code: http://dpaste.com/G5TMN2PAY
[03:51:53] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ dpaste: . ]
[03:52:52] <Grinnz> yes, @{$_[0]} dereferences and copies the elements out of the array, you then assigned those elements to a different array
[03:53:05] <Grinnz> if you want to affect the original array, just don't copy the elements from it, use the arrayref directly
[03:53:19] <Grinnz> my $aref = $_[0];
[03:53:30] <Grinnz> or my ($aref) = @_; or my $aref = shift;
[03:53:43] <Grinnz> then pop @$aref;
[03:54:26] <Grinnz> perlbot: ref
[03:54:27] <perlbot> Grinnz: For information about references in perl, see the built-in perldocs: http://p3rl.org/REF , or if that fails: http://perl-begin.org/topics/references/ . | http://mvp.kablamo.org/basics/references/
[03:54:30] <Grinnz> see those docs for more
[03:54:51] <_73> oh ok. So are `@$_[0]`, and `@{$_[0]}` different?
[03:55:24] <Grinnz> yes, @$_[0] means @{$_}[0] which is just a wrong way to write ${$_}[0] and depends on $_ being an arrayref, which is unrelated to @_
[03:55:54] <Grinnz> so it's probably not what you want :)
[03:56:01] <_73> ok thanks I got it now
[03:56:42] <Grinnz> most people find the $_[x] syntax ugly and so use one of the other two methods i mentioned for unpacking @_
[03:56:56] <Grinnz> i tend to use $_[x] only in one line subs for efficiency
[03:58:30] <_73> I only use $_[x] when I am dealing with arrays so I can just immediately derefence it like @{$_[x]}. I haven't found another way to deref and unpack the arg in one line.
[03:58:53] <Grinnz> well, you usually don't want to, because of the case you just ran into
[03:59:38] <Grinnz> arrayrefs can be used anywhere arrays can, so it's best to just use the ref directly, unless you have a case where you actually don't want to affect the original structure
[03:59:39] <_73> right, this is the first time I ran into that. Usually I try not to mutate things in my subroutines.
[04:00:08] <Grinnz> copying to a new array is an extra step, especially for larger arrays
[04:01:05] *** Joins: Adura (~Adura@user/adura)
[04:01:06] <Grinnz> but yeah, i have definitely done @{$_[0]} in subs where i want a copy
[04:02:03] <_73> thanks though it doesn't definetly doesn't make sense to always copy like I have been doing.
[04:07:59] <gordonfish> Fwiw, $_[0]->@* is a bit nicer to look at than @{$_[0]}
[04:09:13] <haarg> @{+shift} can be another option
[04:13:50] <gordonfish> Or shift->@*

Arguably, though, postderef doesn't really break that, since -> operates on whatever is to the left (normally a ref), much like a method call, except you know what you're getting back already by the sigil on the right.

[06:19:03] <Juerd> The thing is, in places where you need an array, I typically know that just before I can think of what expression will give me that.
[06:19:25] <Juerd> After push comes @, not $, for example
[06:19:27] <gordonfish> I find that looking at postderef like a method call (e.g., one that returns a list) really helps make it fit in with pre-postref perl. I mean it uses the same -> operator after all, so for all intents and purposes, it's like a method every ref has.
[06:20:28] <Juerd> And in the case where I think of the expression first, and then realise it's an array, I just want $foo->push badly and hate that we don't get that without tricks.
[06:20:30] <gordonfish> Juerd: True (though there was a time when array/hash refs in keys/values/each/push/exists was an (experimental) thing)

[06:28:44] <gordonfish> In general, I don't see a practical difference between $foo->returns_aref->@* and $foo->returns_list, in both cases, the left-most sigil doesn't reveal what is resulting. 
[06:29:21] <Juerd> Not many things return an arrayref though, they're mostly in scalars, possibly in nested structures.
[06:29:38] <gordonfish> A ref is a scalar
[06:29:40] <gordonfish> An
[06:29:43] <gordonfish> err A
[06:29:59] <Juerd> Indeed it is
[06:30:17] <Juerd> It's confusing that the term 'scalar' is used both for the container and the value :)

[06:31:19] <gordonfish> A scalar can be a primitive value (string, int, float) or a reference to a scalar, array, hash, code, etc.
[06:31:45] *** Quits: zakame (~zakame@user/zakame) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[06:32:10] <gordonfish> And plenty of sub routines and methods return array, hash, etc references.
[06:32:28] <Juerd> Or undef, or a glob, or ... :)
[06:32:54] <Juerd> I know. I've written a few :P
[06:33:28] <Juerd> But in my experience things that return a list are significantly more common than things that return a single reference to an array.
[06:33:29] <gordonfish> yep
[06:33:39] <gordonfish> Probably, yeah
[06:33:43] *** Joins: zakame (~zakame@user/zakame)
[06:34:20] <gordonfish> I think my point about $foo->returns_aref->@* vs $foo->returns_list still stands though.
[06:34:25] <Juerd> And in general, when I'm using @{ ... }, the expression inside is not a function or method call, but something from a nested data structure.
[06:34:35] <Juerd> (Mostly because if it's not nested, I'll leave out the {})
[06:35:01] <Juerd> Thing is, if you extrapolate your point, you'll end up arguing that sigils are useless
[06:35:06] <Juerd> Which, well, they are.
[06:35:27] <Juerd> Because why would there be a difference between returns_scalar() and $scalar_variable?
[06:35:38] <gordonfish> The point being that while it's nice that the left most sigil is normally a big clue as to what sort of value the result is, it's not always the case, like with method calls, where you need to be aware of what it yields.
[06:36:01] <gordonfish> Juerd: Yes I mostly uses it with structs as well
[06:36:08] <Juerd> @{ ... } or ->@* isn't just a clue, it's a promise. Things will break if it's not going to get what it wants.
[06:36:37] <Juerd> Argh, I hate that the term 'promise' is taken by the async people. Let's say contract :)
[06:36:42] <gordonfish> Hey, I like sigils in perl, to the point that I sometimes find variable to be a bit... naked... when doing things in other langs
[06:36:59] <Juerd> That's the thing, an array is a variable and a list of things is not

[13:16:41] <Mandevil> vague: Also thanks, the stringification works nicely.
[13:16:52] <perlbot> Mandevil pasted a new file at https://l.perl.bot/p/map2tc - 
[13:17:04] <Mandevil> The final product I think.
[13:17:19] <haarg> you probably want to add fallback => 1
[13:17:52] <Mandevil> What fallback?
[13:18:23] <haarg> use overload fallback => 1, bool => sub () { 1 }, '""' => 'boottime_db';
[13:18:27] <Mandevil> Ah
[13:19:57] <Mandevil> I'm not sure I even should use overload here.
[13:20:07] <Mandevil> It's just saving few chars once.
[13:20:11] <haarg> actually probably better to use a sub like you had - while you can list a method name as i showed, you don't want to pass any extra parameters to an accessor so it's probably better to make sure none are passed along.
[13:20:31] <haarg> since overload methods can be passed extra params
[13:20:33] <Mandevil> I was thinking about that.
[13:20:58] <haarg> but if you don't really need your object to act as a string, i'd just avoid the whole thing
[13:21:09] <Mandevil> Yeah, it's bit of an overkill here.
[13:21:21] <Mandevil> But good to know how it's done.
[13:21:56] <Mandevil> Thanks for the input :)

[14:46:26] <horsepatat> so it has to be return ( $stuff or die '' ) ?
[14:46:48] <lopid> that's saying you want to return an exception?
[14:46:56] <lopid> what do you actually want to do?
[14:47:22] <huf> what, no.
[14:47:25] <huf> it doesnt return an exception
[14:47:44] <lopid> exactly, it doesn't make sense, hence the unanswered question
[14:47:49] <LeoNerd> return $thing || die "There wasn't a thing";   is valid. and relatively idiomatic
[14:48:20] <horsepatat> okay, now you two contradict it
[14:48:43] <lopid> we don't know what "it" is
[14:49:43] <huf> https://i.redd.it/shxslcl4usn21.png
[14:49:58] <horsepatat> right, so return ( $stuff || die ) is correct, otherwise it tests for return success, not $stuff.
[14:50:28] <huf> you dont need the () there
[14:51:43] <horsepatat> right, with || I dont, with 'or' I do.
[14:51:48] <huf> yeah

[14:52:11] <horsepatat> or rather many details.
[14:54:07] <LeoNerd> The wordy boolean operators are extremely low precedence
[14:54:40] <LeoNerd> `or` ismin fact the lowest prec operator in the whole language. bottom of the list
[14:54:42] <horsepatat> I only know to use it with open, really.
[14:54:57] *** Quits: zakame (~zakame@user/zakame) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[14:55:10] <horsepatat> so I dont have to use open(), just open $fh,'<',$file or die $!
[14:55:40] <horsepatat> it basically tests the whole thing before last ; or something?
[14:55:51] <LeoNerd> perl operators that act as functions don't *need* parens around their args. no
[14:55:59] <shlomif> horsepatat: "my $fh"
[14:56:09] <horsepatat> our $fh
[14:56:13] <LeoNerd> some people choose to add them, but that's a fairly rare style
[14:56:50] *** Joins: zakame (~zakame@user/zakame)
[14:58:05] <LeoNerd> Usually parens are fairly rare, just method calls `$obj->meth(@args)` and to override operator precedence, e.g. `($x + $y) * $z`
[14:59:10] <Altreus> return $x or die is perfectly fine and quite common and entirely understandable
[14:59:22] <huf> it's a bug tho :D
[14:59:25] <Altreus> the invalid part is dying with a string - please use objects
[14:59:30] <huf> return never returns a value :)
[14:59:30] <LeoNerd> It just doesn't do what you think

[20:25:32] <LeoNerd> If undef values aren't allowed, you can   pairgrep { defined $b } ...

[20:42:24] <Altreus> The use case is I was dealing with HTTP headers, which are often defined as an even-sized array
[20:42:58] <Altreus> It does not work simply to define a header again - which is basically why it's an array to begin with
[20:43:06] <thrig> what happens if there are duplicate header keys?
[20:43:18] <Altreus> It sends two of the same header because that's allowed
