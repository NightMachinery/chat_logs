[00:38:35] <coruja> feral_hedgehog: ok, then i may put it differently, i just wanted to warn you of maybe being disappointed if you don't get official support by sway and are on your own, and let's see then what time will bring up
[00:39:12] <dviola> topcat_001: disable the nvidia igpu on the bios?
[00:39:58] <topcat_001> FWIW with nvidia cards < Turing (hence no power off feature using PRIME offload) nvidia-xrun works well.
[00:40:58] <topcat_001> I use it with the dgpu powered off most times, and sometimes on the dgpu with PRIME sync (so vsync works). Full performance and pretty good. I use startx.
[00:41:02] <feral_hedgehog> coruja: Ohh I'm just fine with that, I've been running the wlroots-eglstreams fork for several months with little issues. I just wanted to check if anyone's had better luck getting the newest version to run. I would honestly buy an AMD GPU if I could, but as it stands last gen (!) cards cost as much as my entire system did
[00:41:37] <topcat_001> dviola: No not from BIOS. I like the option to use the dgpu when desk bound.
[00:42:11] <coruja> but anyway, this code snippet is nice: "To launch sway anyway, launch with --my-next-gpu-wont-be-nvidia and DO NOT report issues." ;)
[00:42:20] <topcat_001> With cards >= Turing the official method (PRIME offlod) works quite well.
[00:43:13] <topcat_001> On my Precision power draw with dgpu off is about 3W. Excellent battery life as a result.
[00:43:36] <topcat_001> roughly 6% drain / hr
[00:44:48] <dviola> topcat_001: I got one of those dells with intel+nvidia from work too, nouveau worked fine but I was using the intel one as primary

[00:47:15] <topcat_001> I have a 16" MBP and like it a lot. Even with Intel it is quite an amazing machine.
[00:47:41] <balrog> M1 is proprietary, but the Linux bare-metal distribution for it is reverse-engineered and open source
[00:47:56] <topcat_001> However my main work setup is an OpenBSD Dell Optiplex, and a Precision running Arch (both work provided).
[00:47:57] <eom-dev> I don't doubt it!  I love my Intel mac.
[00:48:10] <balrog> Apple only cares about macOS on it. They provide a way to boot arbitrary OSes on it, but that's pretty much it.
[00:48:50] <feral_hedgehog> Wait, archlinuxarm runs on the M1?

[05:45:18] <ectospasm> gschanuel: read the rsync manual, I think if rsync can't finish copying the file it won't delete the source.  There are flags to change that behavior, but you have to be intentional about it.

[05:46:46] <gschanuel> This is what I thought: 1) create the lvm (pv, vg and lv) with the new disk; 2) rsync _some_ of the content from the old hdd to the new one, deleting the data from the old one; 3) resize the old hdd partition and add the free space to the lv; 4) keep doing that until all is done;

[05:51:11] <gschanuel> so now I have the partial same data on both disks and almost no free space
[05:51:19] <ectospasm> Do you have access to a file server or network attached storage (NAS).  rsync by default only deletes when it finishes copying the whole set.  You have to use specific flags to change that behavior.
[05:51:41] <ectospasm> It's in the rsync manual:  man rsync
[05:52:08] <gschanuel> it is deleting the "new" data that it's synchronizing now as it finishes each file

[16:32:20] <_avapxia> hello good people of #archlinux. 
[16:32:20] <_avapxia> Im having apparently issues with gdbus and my user. 
[16:32:20] <_avapxia> I cant use fprintd as a normal user (but it seems to run fine with user root), and I can't run virt-manager as a normal user (I was asking about this on monday here). Both program gives error from gdbus (like "GDBus.Error:net.reactivated.Fprint.Error.PermissionDenied" or "GDBus.Error:org.gtk.GDBus.UnmappedGError.Quark._g_2dfile_2derror_2dquark.Code4") and worked perfectly fine a week ago and conf did not changed. 
[16:32:20] <_avapxia> I dont know what package should i look for, how to get started to fix it, or where to report it. any clues welcome ! :)

[20:16:47] <atomicwrites> So I'm trying to run anbox and I'm running the linux-zen kernel which has ashmem and binder built in supposedly, but running `anbox session-manager` throws
[20:16:49] <atomicwrites> > Failed to start as either binder or ashmem kernel drivers are not loaded
[20:16:51] <atomicwrites> Just in case I tried `modprobe -a binder-linux ashmem-linux` per the wiki but both modules are unavailable, which makes sense as the should be compiled in. I made sure I am running zen with uname. I found one guy on the arch forum saying you have to mess with mkinitcpio.conf for some reason, but that doesn't seem right at all <https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=260522>. any ideas?
