[03:23:57] <Dean> i started...hnn, recently. how long have i been coming here?
[03:24:12] <greeter> that i don't know. i've only been in the channel a couple of weeks myself
[03:24:48] <Dean> ive not installed something from github like this before. ive used codespaces but it is not the same.
[03:25:14] <Dean> i think maybe i am on 3 months? 4 maybe?
[03:25:24] <greeter> it's a bit finicky for pdcurses i find. i tried for days to install it for DOS, then finally gave up and switched to a windows build
[03:25:34] *** Joins: steve_ (~steve@ool-182c2b80.dyn.optonline.net)
[03:25:44] <Dean> I should get a book on git.
[03:26:22] <greeter> i probably should do the same really. i have to take a trip out of country soon, and it would be nice to know how to use git to update my repo while i'm away
[03:26:52] <ioxzev1z> git has a free manual
[03:26:58] <ioxzev1z> decent quality

[03:28:48] <Dean> greeter: i dont know what a makefile is. is it a bundled up collection of commands to compile your code? like eg, could i make a 'makefile' to run gcc with -o and instead of typing out -o i'd just make instead?
[03:29:11] *** Quits: hiroshi_ (~freedom@151.57.59.90) (Quit: hiroshi_)
[03:29:35] <greeter> essentially. a makefile is intended to automate compilation. i'm using mine so that i can compile linux and windows builds of my code separately as needed. this way i can ensure the code is portable
[03:29:43] <greeter> well, at least to those two platforms
[03:30:37] <ioxzev1z> Try SCons
[03:31:12] <Dean> ok thank you greeter
[03:31:26] <greeter> hmm SCons looks pretty cool, i might give it a whirl
[03:32:00] <ioxzev1z> Yeah imo easier than make, more modern also
[03:32:53] <greeter> i don't know if i'll use it for this project, but i do have a more complex one i want to move onto after this one and it's far more important to me that it works on windows and linux, it seems like it'll definitely fit the bill for that

[03:44:30] <ioxzev1z> greeter, even if you have a 60" monitor, you should probably wrap your lines at 80 - 120 characters
[03:45:01] <greeter> you mean where i have the long lines of text that i'm copying to buffers, like locations[i].long_desc?
[03:45:21] <ioxzev1z> greeter, code I would wrap 80, but in this case I'm talking about your comments
[03:45:34] <ioxzev1z> They're long enough for the page to need a horizontal scroll bar
[03:45:38] <greeter> oh the comments, hmm, i do get carried away sometimes. let me take another look at them
[03:46:09] <ioxzev1z> Vertical scrolling is fine with a mouse but horizontal gets quite annoying
[03:46:55] <greeter> ah i see what you mean, the comments in main.c are rather long. i should format those better. should probably also format the long strcpy() calls better too in init.c

[04:07:57] <greeter> will do, i'm just updating some of the comments so that they aren't (as) wrong lol
[04:08:21] <ioxzev1z> Also rather than having void {north,east,south,west}(), just have void move(char direction, ...)
[04:09:33] <ioxzev1z> Or rather than char direction, make an enum for all possible directions, then pass the enum to the move function
[04:09:39] <greeter> Ah that's a good idea, i'll get to work on that
[04:09:43] <ioxzev1z> That changes 8 functions to 1
[04:10:04] <greeter> uploaded init.c so it should be up to date now
[04:10:25] <greeter> also it should actually change 10 functions to 1, up and down would also be consolidated. did i forget to code those?
[04:10:49] <ioxzev1z> That init.c is much better
[04:11:06] <greeter> thank you :-)
[04:11:39] <ioxzev1z> wrt to long strings, you can do "foo" "bar" which then becomes "foobar", hence you can "something "\n"something else", which then becomes "something something else"

[18:05:15] <gruekun[m]> There are alternatives. But bash is widely recognized and has a ton of momentum behind it, so I think the willingness to replace it outright just isn't there (unless you're a power user with a strong preference for some other interpreter)
