[02:31:34] <kalen> onosendi, yes, that particular example is fairly straightforward. but when you have a strict "no mutation" coding style, like ljharb does, i imagine there are going to be situations where you're going to create many intermediate/temp variables while you process certain things. and picking a new name for each one might get cumbersome or verbose unless you have some sort of strategy/convention to fall back on
[02:31:56] <ljharb> kalen: no, i usually name them based on what the transformation is
[02:32:08] <ljharb> kalen: and sure, i chain whenever it makes sense

[05:06:00] <KevinX> you're iterating over each char though
[05:06:08] <KevinX> so you don't do anything global at all
[05:06:12] <deltab> you can do it without the loop
[05:06:45] <KevinX> Just do this: `lookup.forEach((v, k) => { str = str.replace(k, v) })`
[05:06:49] <blahboybaz> KevinX: yeah and I think replace does that for me when using global regex. But map needs to know what to ".get()" and depends on that loop for it, so..
[05:07:01] <deltab> str = str.replace(/[<>&"']/g, (m) => lookup.get(m))
[05:07:13] <KevinX> you probably want `g` too

[05:10:22] <blahboybaz> oh well, time to do it right I guess

[08:12:06] <ljharb> and it's still a proposal that hasn't been presented. it is highly unlikely it will advance.

[09:01:38] <theskillwithin> wes bos is working on a typescript course right now
[09:01:56] <KevinX> i use typescript on company code I don't plan to update much, like our server API

[09:02:43] <KevinX> and the code base is easy to visualize

[09:03:07] <theskillwithin> but its probably fine

[11:18:05] <makara-> why cant I run this `yarn global add eslint`. I get "Usage Error: No project found in /home/makara"
[11:20:09] <theskillwithin> teut a simple react frontend compiles to static files.  for nextjs you usually need node running on the server to use
[11:20:30] <makara-> yarn v3.0.0
[11:20:41] <teut> a simple react frontend compiles to static files.
[11:20:49] <teut> for this you dont require a server?
[11:21:04] <teut> webpack compiled the files I got it
[11:21:13] <teut> but to serve them you need the server right?
[11:21:43] <theskillwithin> both you need a server fo sure ya.  but theres a difference between hosting a node app,  and just hosting static files
[11:21:47] <teut> a server is just a websocket connection , snt it?

[11:23:23] <teut> why use it for single page apps but?
[11:23:31] <teut> whats the advantage, the routes?
[11:23:50] <theskillwithin> ehh theres lots, but first that comes to mind is SSR
[11:24:06] <teut> I said he wants single page app

[16:08:21] <box2> what's a good way to identify only true chrome browser (not brave/edge/opera/etc) without parsing the user agent?
[16:10:13] <box2> `navigator.vendor` for everything says 'Google Inc.'
[16:11:41] <box2> `window.chrome` exists on all of them
[16:13:37] <box2> i could look for and exclude browsers that expose things like `navigator.brave` but building up a big list of evidence of incorrect browser seems like a poor way to do it compared to just one piece of evidence that it is the right browser
[16:13:44] <matsaman> I doubt there is a "good way" to do that, nor does there need to be
[16:14:33] <matsaman> put another way: why do you need to know
[16:14:34] <box2> i am experimenting with trust tokens, which are only available on true chrome at this moment.  attempting to use them on other browsers will yield errors
[16:14:36] <matsaman> put another way: you don't
[16:14:39] <box2> i do
[16:14:47] <matsaman> well errors are pretty indicative, no?
[16:15:04] <box2> i cannot catch and hide `fetch()` errors
[16:15:18] <box2> that seems like poor design
[16:15:45] <matsaman> something that only works in one browser seems like poor design
[16:16:14] <box2> it's experimental, if they continue with it as a success it will be pushed to the others
[16:17:32] <box2> https://www.chromium.org/updates/trust-token/
[16:17:48] <matsaman> hard to imagine you can't hide the errors, but I also don't know why it matters if it only works in one browser

[16:27:20] <box2> i found a way to hide most of the errors by checking for other filetypes on the remote server first, but even without that, i don't want all the traffic that i know won't be effective to make requests to my server using the limited bandwidth

[16:29:33] <bud> hello i have a strange question about webextensions.
[16:30:01] <bud> i have been hacking on this thing for days. and i finally got NativeMessaging host to "work" with an extension.
[16:30:42] <bud> i have it hooked up so i can send urls from the browser to my external URL handler.
[16:30:59] <bud> and everything seemed to work fine, but i have now realized that something is not right.
[16:32:27] <bud> in this external urlhandler thing i do all sorts of thing, a common task is to download podcast audio. convert it to mp3 and add album art (both actions with ffmpeg). but i see that ffmpeg gets segmentation fault everytime i do it via the native host/messaging stuff.
[16:33:12] <bud> i have tried different ways of starting the process from python, and even wrote a host app in bash, but with same segmentation fault errors when using ffmpeg.
[16:33:15] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[16:33:30] <Alexendoo> box2: Test for the presence of the feature, not by browser. The API appears to add document.hasTrustToken so you could test for the presence of that
[16:33:47] <matsaman> Alexendoo++
[16:34:04] <box2> ah, yea that's a good idea
[16:34:12] <box2> i will try, thanks!
[16:34:27] <bud> ffmpeg can use lots of resources when it is converting, so i am wondering maybe there is a resource cap set by the browser on the host application.

[16:36:16] <bud> i guess its borderline offtopic, but it is specific to web extensions, so i thought if anyone knows its the javascript people.
[16:36:32] <bud> i have only tested in vivaldi. i will see if firefox borks out as well.
[16:36:40] <matsaman> so how are you using ffmpeg?
[16:37:13] <bud> normal usage, -i input output.mp3 . the command works otherwise.
[16:37:31] <matsaman> bud: like in a loop?

[23:33:34] <onosendi> mikrosis: the action button is the child, and the "go back" button is the parent? This seems like something that both buttons should be positioned absolute in a parent container. I dunno, I guess I still don't understand.
[23:34:18] <onosendi> <button><button>Foo</button></button> isn't even valid HTML.
