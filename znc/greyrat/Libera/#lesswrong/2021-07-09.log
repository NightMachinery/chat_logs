[02:47:51] <shawwwn> That they eat bones
[02:47:53] <Betawolf> They can and do eat bones.
[02:48:14] <Betawolf> I mean, you can google 'pigs eat bones' and see people talking about how their pigs were eating bones.
[02:48:37] <shawwwn> Uh huh. Google is how you know, riight
[02:48:47] <shawwwn> Sounds like you disposed of a few bodies
[02:49:00] <Betawolf> "My pigs once, during a major snowstorm somehow killed and/or ate a deer. "
[02:49:08] <Betawolf> ('or'?)

[02:50:52] <Robomot> can pigs eat cooked chicken bones? | Homesteading Forum (Wanted to ask if pigs can eat cooked rotisserie chicken bones safely before doing so.)
[02:50:56] <adiabatic> >venison-fed pork
[02:50:58] <saturn2> "the pigs may have swallowed the deer whole and spat it out again still alive. or not, i'm not sure"
[02:51:19] <gwern> it's possible they killed the deer, but some spoilsport mountain lion stole and ate it
[02:51:42] <gwern> Betawolf: chicken bones are weak-ass shit, though, I'd expect a human femur to put up way more resistance
[02:51:53] <catern> gwern: does unusual comma usage actually make GPT-3 make lots of other mistakes? that would be an indication that people reading my blog will expects mistakes if I have unusual comma usage...
[02:52:04] <catern> or is that just exaggeration?
[02:52:11] <Betawolf> Yeah, the discussion goes off-topic. Also cooked bird bones splinter, which is what the question is actually about.
[02:52:40] <adiabatic> if you screw up your grammar people will misunderestimate your brains unless you have an obvious excuse like being foreign
[02:52:54] <gwern> catern: oh yes. well, I haven't formally quantitatively benchmarked it, but I've definitely found that copy-editing my prompt helps, that GPT-3 will imitate the exact typos you make, quality generally degrades, and you can see Leike's tweet showing quantitatively their benchmarking showing an identical phenomenon
[02:52:59] <catern> adiabatic: hey, we just discussed this, I'm not screwing it up I'm using prosodic commas!
[02:53:07] <gwern> catern: and I've definitely helped people improve their prompts by pointing out their typos
[02:53:23] <adiabatic> but you can't just tell people that unless you want to put a big "I use prosodic commas" explainer link at the top of every post
[02:53:48] <catern> gwern: avoiding typos and spelling mistakes makes sense, for sure, I'm talking about comma usage though, which seems kind of idiosyncratic, there are lots of different styles...
[02:53:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.redfeatherfarm.org/211-the-biggest-pigs-in-the-world.html
[02:53:50] <Robomot> THE LARGEST PIG IN THE WORLD: LARGE BREEDS AND CHAMPIONS (PHOTO) - ANIMALS - 2021 (In the article we will talk about the biggest boars and pigs in the world. Let's call the names of famous pig record holders. Let us describe the breeds of pigs, whose representatives can be called the largest or fat (fat) pigs and boars. And also we will specify breeds of pigs who have every chance to break the known records.)
[02:53:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Today, the largest pig in the world is the giant piggy Rumba, living in the United States. Its dimensions can be confidently called impressive, because the total body length is 7 m, and the weight reaches 5 tons."
[02:53:58] <adiabatic> unless you want to be cute and say "tired: oxford commas. wired: prosodic commas"
[02:54:18] <gwern> my belief is that this is related to the perfection premium and signaling. "if this writer can't even be bothered to spell "it's" right, how careless and sloppy and lazy and incompetent must they be at everything else?"
[02:54:26] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: '5 tons' this absolute unit
[02:54:27] <adiabatic> Some pig. Wonder how it tasted.
[02:54:46] <gwern> at 5 tons, you could ride it into battle
[02:54:55] <catern> (like, if GPT-3 starts generating mistake-filled garbage when fed text using prosodic commas.... then maybe I should stop using prosodic commas)
[02:54:57] <Betawolf> shawwwn: https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/can-pigs-make-a-body-disappear/ does some work for you.

[02:55:13] <Betawolf> "pigs cannot chew the larger bones of the human body, but that they will break them into smaller bits to make them more manageable. Human hair and teeth, on the other hand (or hoof), are not digestible to hogs and will get left behind."
[02:55:33] <catern> adiabatic: oh I don't care enough for that - just knowing that my comma usage *can* be justified means I can shift the burden to the reader to be smart enough to justify it
[02:55:43] <catern> it's kind of a non-constructive proof
[02:55:52] <adiabatic> yeah but basically nobody knows about the prosodic comma

[03:04:27] <catern> you co‚ßñu‚ßñld do the same for individual words, too!
[03:05:49] <catern> the romans had it right and the linguists are wrong, punctuation and grammar are useless, you just need different pause lengths
[03:06:01] <gwern> honestly, if you want to go in for experimental typography, I think there's much more interesting directions. like using a NN like BERT to parse the syntax tree and grammar of your sentences and display the trees, or do syntax highlighting
[03:06:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> tl;dr of this article: primitive people, hunter-gatherers and whatnot, do lots of disgusting shit, like eat rotting meat, wear pieces of decomposing flesh as jewelry, etc.
[03:07:00] <catern> parsing out that information after the fact? I'd rather encode it explicitly from the start - the prospect of writing prose like a program is enticing to me
[03:07:09] <gwern> too much work. no one ever does that
[03:07:19] <catern> (I already use semantic newlines, which I absolutely love)
[03:07:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> ("But how do they avoid getting all sorts of horrible infections and diseases and whatnot!" They don't)
[03:07:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> ("But that would mean that they get sick with all sorts of horrible things all the time!" Yes)
[03:08:06] <gwern> think https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/syntax-highlighting-is-a-waste-of-an-information/ but for natural language. for example, you could do 'named entity' parsing, and assign a unique color to each unique entity, and all the references. "<blue>George Washington</blue> was the first american president. <blue>He</blue> was a great man." etc
[03:08:06] <Robomot> Syntax highlighting is a waste of an information channel (No newsletter next week Running the TLA+ workshop. No way I‚Äôm gonna have any brainpower after that. Syntax highlighting is a waste of an information channel...)
[03:08:10] <catern> gwern: well I'm already talking about alternative typography - I'm implying I'm willing to go to great lengths while working on my prose
[03:09:19] <catern> hm, interesting idea. but I still think I'd prefer to explicitly encode that
[03:09:44] <catern> after all, once I expliclity and symbolically encode my prose, I can translate it to any language for free, too! :^)
[03:10:13] <catern> (I'll just have to travel into the future to the year 2000, by then they'll surely have gotten that working)
[03:10:24] <gwern> :thinking_face: "The story is that young Boltzmann was dissatisfied with the rigor of his physics textbooks. Finally he heard about a textbook of impeccable logic. He rushed to check it out, but found the library had already loaned it; and it was in English. He went home dismayed, but his wiser older brother comforted him: 'A few weeks for a good book is not too long to wait. Further, if it...
[03:10:31] <gwern> ...is truly logical then the author will surely explain each term carefully before using it; so the language can't <i>really</i> matter.' Boltzman implies that this event cured him of trying to be too deductive in his physics."

[03:12:19] <Robomot> Postscript: Orwell for Socialism - Econlib ([Scroll to the end for a couple final reactions to comments .] In a reflective moment, George Orwell wrote, ‚ÄúEvery line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against¬†totalitarianism and¬†for democratic socialism, as I understand it.‚Äù¬† Yet if you actually read his oeuvre, you‚Äôll find a striking ‚Ä¶)
[03:13:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Orwell, writing in defense of democratic socialism (and against laissez-faire capitalism), writes "The trouble with competitions is that somebody wins them." Caplan, by way of refuting him writes:
[03:13:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This is misleading even for athletics.  Yes, someone wins the game.  To continue winning, however, even the best teams have to keep practicing and improving.  Every day is another chance for losing teams to turn things around.
[03:13:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> The same goes for business.  On any given day, some firms are doing great.  That doesn‚Äôt mean, however, that they‚Äôve permanently ‚Äúwon.‚Äù  Even if all of their direct competitors go out of business, successful firms have to worry about future competitors.  Amazon is by far the best store in history, but they tirelessly strive to improve because they want to _stay_ number one."
[03:13:45] <gwern> catern: anyway I assure you that you will spend plenty of time fixing up NN errors, and that will gratify your bubble-popping factorio-optimizing inner nerd as much as necessary
[03:14:06] <kuudes> isn't the moat idea against that? the point being to win once so that you prevent others trying again?
[03:14:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... but actually Amazon notably *doesn't* improve various very important (to the customer!) things - like, say, the absolute farce that is Amazon reviews - precisely because they're number one and no one can compete
[03:14:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Right
[03:14:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> So actually Caplan's example, instead of proving his point, proves exactly the point he's arguing against

[05:38:17] <ggreer> https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a36877585/ev-1000-11-electric-cars-long-distance-race/ moral of the story: do not attempt a road trip in a non-tesla
[05:38:17] <Robomot> The EV 1000: 11 EVs Face Off in a Long-Distance Race (A 1000-mile race across four states reveals what it's like to drive an EV long distances in 2021. Spoiler: It's possible but not always fun.)
[05:42:07] <spxtr> ggreer: why do you like EVs so much? they seem very cumbersome compared to ICEs for many purposes, especially long-distances or rural drives.
[05:42:30] <ggreer> the guy in the model s knew what he was doing. the model y and model 3 owners just obeyed whatever the tesla nav said to do, so they spent more time charging
[05:42:37] <gwern> '. In the final moments before the race, VanderWerp's friend and co-pilot surveyed the competition and quietly observed: "Everyone's wearing pants. That's a mistake. All of these people are going to need climate control."'
[05:43:12] <ggreer> spxtr: they're the future. the only disadvantages are range and charging times. everything else is way better

[05:44:26] <gwern> so what I'm taking away from this read is that chargers are so widespread now you can basically dirve anywhere and it's fine
[05:44:59] <gwern> this isn't some jaunt up the california coast from the tesla factory to a tesla dealer
[05:45:09] <ggreer> yeah, though the quality of the non-tesla chargers is kinda shitty right now
[05:45:15] <ggreer> still, it's getting better all the time
[05:45:15] <spxtr> my impression was that there are still plenty of rural parts of the USA where there aren't enough chargers, but for the vast majority of people there are enough
[05:45:51] <ggreer> it's easy to drive across the US in a tesla. I've gone >600 miles in a day and passed 3 supercharging stations between stops
[05:46:50] <ggreer> also in the worst case you drive into an RV park and plug in. it charges super slow (20-50 miles of range per hour) but it'll do the job
[05:46:59] <gwern> spxtr: sure, but this is like frigging rural ohio
[05:47:04] <spxtr> If you want to drive for ~800 miles nonstop, how much time will you have to spend charging? I do that several times yearly.
[05:47:30] <gwern> once you've covered everywhere denser than rural ohio, you must've covered like 90% of the population
[05:47:30] <ggreer> well in that experiment, the model S drove 1000 miles and spent 14.5 on the road and 1.5 charging
[05:47:40] <ggreer> *14.5 hours
[05:47:55] <spxtr> that's not as terrible as I expected
[05:48:54] <ggreer> teslas charge stupid fast. if you're using the v3 superchargers, going from 0% to 50% takes less than 20 minutes. that's >100 miles of range
[05:49:09] <ggreer> also you wake up every day with a full charge because you plug the car in overnight
[05:49:40] <spxtr> Sure, but it takes something like 5 min to exit the freeway, fill my car with petrol, then get back on the freeway :)
[05:50:33] <feep> my scooter can do like ten miles~
[05:50:35] <ggreer> yeah but human beings need breaks for food, bathroom, etc. and to just stretch your legs
[05:51:44] <spxtr> ggreer: one time I drove a fellow rationalist up to seattle from SF. I'm accustomed to doing the entire drive with 2 gas stops and one fast food stop. They were not happy with that XD
[05:52:00] <ggreer> yeah most people aren't robots and need more stops :)
[05:52:28] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[05:53:12] <spxtr> imo the annoyances for long trips aren't all that big of a deal for me. my next car will probably be electric
[05:53:16] <ggreer> I drove from SF to portland and I stopped 3 times. portland to spokane is one stop, maybe 2 if you want to minimize time spent charging (cars charge very fast from 0% to 50%, but going from 90% to 100% takes like 30 minutes)
[05:54:00] <spxtr> I absolutely hate touch-screen interfaces for critical car controls though, that's actually the deal-breaker for me
[05:54:42] <ggreer> road trips are definitely the weakest part of EVs, but they've gotten to the point where it's not much of an issue. and the advantages (being able to run climate control without any "engine", ridiculous acceleration, waking up with a full charge every day) outweigh them
[05:54:55] <ggreer> there's voice control too
[05:55:29] <spxtr> at least in my friend's tesla, the voice control was awful. he had to repeat everything several times

[07:19:32] <feep> .note bildramer I've been at this 50x50 for like an hour and it's only a quarter done
[07:22:42] <quanticle> gwern: I don't know, it might be useful to have a "Here's how to cite this blog," section in your /About
[07:22:49] <quanticle> I know some other blogs have that.

[07:23:26] <gwern> I don't even know how you would cite gwern.net. what am I, a MLA expert?
[07:23:36] <gwern> go look up your particular style manual, there's too many
[07:23:53] <quanticle> >all the citation metadata is already in the head of each page as meta tags
[07:23:55] <quanticle> Dude
[07:23:58] <quanticle> Even I didn't know that
[07:24:05] <quanticle> And I'm what people would call "computery"
[07:24:32] <gwern> you've never needed it
[07:24:41] <quanticle> You think your average academic is going to think, "Ah yes, the meta tags! How obvious!"
[07:25:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> So my WoW guild uses a custom-written software solution to keep track of loot now. It's a web app plus an in-game addon. You register your character with a raid team on the web app, enter what items of loot you want, with what priority (you rank them in order of desirability), and when you kill a boss and some pieces drop, the addon communicates with the database, figures out who in the raid most wants the item, and the raid
[07:25:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>  leader gives it to them. It's all very clever and nicely designed.
[07:26:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, when you register your raiding character, you provide name (obviously), specialization (tank/dps/healer) - these things are needed to properly determine who can roll on what items - and you also provide race (human, elf, dwarf, etc.) and gender - this isn't needed for loot assignment, naturally, it's just there so your character can have the appropriate characte icon in lists.
[07:27:11] <gwern> have you guys considered harberger auctions on gear?
[07:27:14] <quanticle> Whoa whoa whoa Obormot\Arcturus praising a web app that isn't PMWiki?
[07:27:16] <quanticle> Who are you
[07:27:21] <quanticle> And what have you done with the real Obormot?
[07:27:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unrelatedly to all of this, in WoW there is an item, crafted by engineers, called a goblin transporter. It lets you teleport to specific locations in the game world, bypassing the need to take the time to travel across the world. Very convenient! But as with all engineer-crafted devices, there's a caveat: sometimes you get transporter accidents!
[07:28:06] <gwern> it's ok, the character who dies wasn't really you
[07:28:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> These can be all sorts of whimsical things, like "you explode" or "you're teleported onto a floating rock a thousand feet off the ground" or, the most fun one, "your character model is transformed into a different race/gender combo for an hour".
[07:28:43] <gwern> what do you do when you land on the rock?
[07:28:57] <gwern> I presume there's no cellphone reception to call your guild
[07:29:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> (you fly down, if you have a flying mount; or parachute down, if you have a parachute cloak; or ... jump down and die, if you have neither)
[07:29:07] <quanticle> Hang out with all the other people who've been teleported onto the rock, I suppose
[07:29:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> So today we had a raid. To get to the raid faster, I used my teleporter. There was an accident. My character (a male dwarf) was transformed into a female gnome.

[07:29:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is fine. It has no effect on stats. It's just cosmetic.
[07:29:32] <gwern> (how many of these teleporter accidents end in 'you die'?)
[07:29:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> We killed a boss. We got some loot. And ... the raid leader discovered that they could not use the addon to assign that loot.
[07:30:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because they got an error.
[07:30:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> That I was the wrong gender.
[07:30:07] <quanticle> superz: Do I need to read the article or is the headline sufficient ;)
[07:30:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> My character's gender did not match the gender registered in the database, you see.
[07:30:31] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: WOW Literally misgendering your character
[07:30:35] <quanticle> Cancel them IMO
[07:30:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> And so the addon refused to proceed in any way.
[07:30:40] <adiabatic> wasn't this a plot point in Papers, Please?
[07:31:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> We had to wait until the effect wore off before we could distribute loot. Because the code could not deal with me being a female gnome.

[07:35:17] <quanticle> I mean... I agree. Releasing software under an MIT or BSD license is little different from releasing it as public domain. After all, who goes into the "About..." dialog box of whatever software they're running and reads the acknowledgements? But why is that bad?
[07:35:19] <quanticle> >As far as I'm concerned using a Cuck License is worse for user freedom than just releasing it in the public domain. This is because at least public domain software can be taken and later additions can be protected by the GPL.
[07:35:21] <quanticle> What are they talking about? I can fork and re-release MIT or BSD licensed code under any license I want, even a proprietary license, so long as I comply with the acknowledgement requirements of the original license. That's the key distinguishing characteristic of those licenses, and a key reason for why Richard Stallman felt the need to come up with the GPL.

I wonder how large businesses/FOSS projects doing complicated things with Hugo deal with the breakage, though, especially since it seems to be often silent.

[15:44:53] <dbohdan> quanticle: Octopress is Jekyll, right?  Jekyll was the most popular SSG at one time (and may still be?).  I kind of want to learn a static site generator I can standardize on for my sites, and I want it to be one I don't maintain.
[15:45:25] <quanticle> Yes, I think so. It's like Jekyll with a custom theme or something.
[15:45:33] <quanticle> It's been a while since I used it
[15:46:20] <quanticle> Of course, we're leaving out the best static site generator of them all

[15:46:25] <quanticle> ;)
[15:46:48] <dbohdan> Obormot\Gaia: I maintain a small niche static site generator, and when I released version 2.0 (semver), I provided a migration tool for my <20 users.  Intellectually, I understand the incentives, cultural factors, and signaling involved, but on some level I am still baffled when a big project so many people rely on operates so carelessly.  If I were breaking things with every release (which is reasonable to do sometimes to get the design right!), I'd 
[15:46:48] <dbohdan> at least have a big notice about it at the top of the front page and the breakage would be front and center in the release notes.
[15:47:04] <quanticle> At one point my entire website was published from an org-mode tree
[15:47:18] <dbohdan> I'll give Emacs another try, I swear
[15:47:29] <quanticle> It was amazing but also a nightmare to set up, mainly because org-publish is so poorly documented
[15:47:47] <quanticle> And I had to write an HTML template into an elisp string
[15:48:04] <kuudes> galambo, sure, I am fine whatever they do in uk. I am just worried that they could bring more disease here
[15:48:29] <kuudes> because vaccines seem possibly only prevent about half of infection carries

[15:50:55] <quanticle> But I didn't know about that at the time
[15:51:36] <quanticle> Anyway, don't consider org-publish to be anything other than the "troll option"
[15:52:16] <quanticle> Org-publish is the gimmick-build static site generator. You do it to show that it's possible not because you're serious
[15:54:00] <galambo> kuudes, afaik vaccines protect you from catching covid. and if you do catch covid your symptoms and infectiousness are much milder than if you did not get vaccinated.
[15:54:47] <galambo> so on balance of risks and benefits I think vaccinated people should have more freedom
[15:55:10] <galambo> also this policy might encourage more people to get vaccinated
[15:55:16] <galambo> so that they can travel
[15:56:12] <dbohdan> quanticle: More and more, I see the average extension for any text editor as a troll option...  It tricks you into thinking your editor can do $thing.
[15:59:38] <quanticle> Well, the extensions for emacs actually usually do the thing
[15:59:48] <quanticle> I mean, I did get org-publish to work
[16:00:01] <quanticle> It would even actually publish (i.e. rsync the HTML to the server)
[16:00:20] <quanticle> And I would have stuck with it had I not replaced org-mode with PMWiki
[16:03:31] <PapuaHardyNet> the worship of the god of diversity makes me irrationally angry
[16:04:50] <PapuaHardyNet> re dbohdan emacs: Emacs is a great experience, it has a consistent UI, the UX is brilliant, but I would suggest you stick to an editor that gets out of the way and doesn't distract you from your work by being so fun to mess around with
[16:05:08] <PapuaHardyNet> I've used emacs for 2.5 years now so I'm not anti-emacs
[16:05:49] <PapuaHardyNet> also, all my experience with emacs has been when using the doom emacs "framework". the vanilla emacs UX is pretty bad for a beginner

[16:15:25] <PapuaHardyNet> which is why I suggested you avoid emacs
[16:15:31] <PapuaHardyNet> (if it wasn't clear before)
[16:16:43] <dbohdan> (I understood)
[16:17:21] <dbohdan> The problem is that it seems obvious to me that a text editor, file manager, command shell, and scripting language are not actually very distinct things.  All four serve related purposes and very likely have positive effects from integration.
[16:17:48] <dbohdan> The reason I am interested in Emacs is that it's one of the few pieces of software that integrate all four
[16:18:23] <dbohdan> VS Code is similar
[16:20:32] <PapuaHardyNet> dired is an absolute joy to use as a file manager
[16:21:28] <PapuaHardyNet> however, emacs elisp is rather fragile
[16:21:58] <quanticle> VSCode is the worse-is-better emacs
[16:22:10] <cpopell> I've moved most of my stuff to Obsidian
[16:22:16] <cpopell> VSCode for the rare actual coding I do
[16:22:26] <PapuaHardyNet> obsidian for taking notes?
[16:22:26] <cpopell> although I anticipate a lot more coding in my relative near future I guess
[16:22:28] <quanticle> I honestly don't know why anyone would use Obsidian
[16:22:46] <quanticle> Because... it just seems like a lot of complication
[16:22:52] <quanticle> Over a directory full of markdown files
[16:22:57] <PapuaHardyNet> agreeed
[16:23:00] <quanticle> Which VSCode will render no problem
[16:23:06] <cpopell> I used vscode before
[16:23:14] <quanticle> Like, Ctrl-Shift-P Markdown Preview
[16:23:20] <cpopell> Oh, I never use preview
[16:23:23] <quanticle> And... that's literally Obsidian right there
[16:23:25] <cpopell> in obsidian or vscode
[16:23:29] <cpopell> I always stay in editing mode
[16:23:44] <quanticle> That mystifies me even more there
[16:23:51] <quanticle> What is the benefit of Obsidian?
[16:24:10] <cpopell> One of the big ones is wikilinks + dataview
[16:24:22] <cpopell> getting wikilinks and aliasing to work right in vscode was annoying
[16:24:32] <cpopell> there's also a spaced repetition plugin I use
[16:24:48] <PapuaHardyNet> please tell me your spaced repetition plugin connects to anki
[16:24:54] <cpopell> no, it runs off my markdown notes
[16:24:58] <quanticle> Yeah, but in VSCode you can just normal-link to other files in the same directory tree. You'll even get autocomplete when you do so.
[16:25:09] <cpopell> yes, but readability is better with wikilinks (with aliasing!)
[16:25:34] <cpopell> oh, there's header level section links, that's nice and I use it a ton
[16:25:34] <quanticle> No, that's what I mean. You can do [here is a link](other-file.md)
[16:25:40] <cpopell> yes, and that's ugly
[16:25:52] <cpopell> remember, I stay in editor mode
[16:26:03] <quanticle> It's less ugly than [[here is a link | other-file]]? I... guess
[16:26:11] <cpopell> no, it's just [[other file]]
[16:26:17] <quanticle> But you said you use aliasing
[16:26:24] <cpopell> yes, it's in the frontmatter of the target file
[16:26:41] <quanticle> Oh, so the other file has a list of other names that it can be called with?
[16:26:51] <cpopell> here are my aliases for Augustus - aliases: [Gaius Octavius, Augustus, Octavian, Caesar Augustus, Augustus Caesar]
[16:26:52] <cpopell> yeah
[16:27:31] <cpopell> I spent a while trying to get all this working in vscode earlier this year
[16:27:35] <quanticle> So every time you come up with a new alias for a file, you have to edit the file that alias points to?
[16:27:37] <cpopell> and foam is a decent attempt at it
[16:27:52] <cpopell> everything is automatically updated
[16:27:57] <quanticle> I see.
[16:28:04] <quanticle> Wait, no I don't.
[16:28:12] <quanticle> Let's say I have a file called emacs.md
[16:28:14] <cpopell> sure
[16:28:21] <quanticle> And I want to refer to it with the alias: spacemacs
[16:28:25] <quanticle> How... does that work?
[16:28:30] <cpopell> you would just put in the yaml--
[16:28:38] <cpopell> aliases: [spacemacs]
[16:28:40] <quanticle> Right, so I'd have to go update emacs.md
[16:29:05] <quanticle> And if I want to refer to it with "doom emacs", I have to go update emacs.md again
[16:29:19] <cpopell> right, but it would find all the backlinks for that
[16:29:32] <cpopell> so you edit one file and it covers your whole project
[16:29:50] <dbohdan> https://web.stanford.edu/group/fan/publication/Raman_Nature_515_540_2014.pdf
[16:30:04] <quanticle> I thought you said this was in the front-matter of the target file, namely emacs.md.
[16:30:23] <dbohdan> That was "Passive radiative cooling below ambient air temperature under direct sunlight"
[16:30:39] <cpopell> quanticle - it is. but if you want to turn any mention of that alias into a link to the target file, you can
[16:30:52] <cpopell> so if you have 'spacemacs' elsewhere, you can turn that into a link to emacs.md once you alias it
[16:31:39] <quanticle> I'm still not seeing the benefit of Obsidian, but maybe that's just because I know sed, lol
[16:32:51] <quanticle> Anyway, whatever works, I suppose
[16:34:31] <PapuaHardyNet> I very much doubt the use of links and backlinks for notetaking
[16:35:24] <cpopell> I mostly use links for hover references, etc. because the majority of my notetaking is notes on books, etc. The 'graph' that Roam people etc. care about doesn't matter too much to me.
[16:35:28] <cpopell> I use spaced repetition a ton
[16:35:55] <PapuaHardyNet> when you have written the notes for yourself, there's no reason you need to have links or backlinks unless you are researching a huge topic and trying to make an original contribution, or you want to implement a zettelkasten for fun
[16:36:09] <cpopell> it's literally to make navigating around easier

[16:47:32] <kuudes> galambo, it seems 2 shot people get infected by delta bout 1/2 of unvaccinated. could be 1/4 maybe if good
[16:48:02] <kuudes> but it seems to me that the ship has now sailed on infections, we still may have protection against hospitalizations, but that is unsure as well
[16:48:58] <galambo> kuudes, my main concern with covid is death. vaccinated people tend not to die. I am against  restricting freedom unless the benefit is at least 10 times the harm of resttricting the freedom
[16:49:29] <kuudes> yes, uk has had more actual restrictions than here
[16:49:42] <kuudes> here restrictions have been mostly on businesses
[16:50:26] <kuudes> I would be for new zealand model where there are much restrictions on the border but few on domestic side. it seems to work quite well
[16:51:10] <quanticle> The problem is that only tends to work for tiny island nations. Even Japan has trouble with that model.
[16:52:12] <kuudes> main problem is that about no country tries it
[16:52:30] <kuudes> uk is an island nation too
[16:53:05] <kuudes> finland is basically an island nation as the border with russia is so closed
[16:53:36] <kuudes> I mean, no one seriously considers driving from finland to estonia, even though that would only be less than 150 km on russian side going highway through st petersburg
[16:53:42] <kuudes> basicly russia is "ocean"
[16:53:43] <quanticle> Sure, but UK has > 1 order of magnitude more people than NZ
[16:53:58] <nshepperd2> even non-island nations can enforce their border if they give enough of a shit
[16:54:05] <kuudes> nshepperd2, yes
[16:54:27] <kuudes> quanticle, yes, but I don't see how that matters
[16:54:28] <quanticle> Yeah, what I'm saying is that NZ can get away with it because NZ is *tiny*. You know kind of like Singapore
[16:54:33] <quanticle> Or Taiwan
[16:55:23] <kuudes> I am unsure what you are referring to. most people in the world can't even on normal times travel to usa or eu etc 
[16:55:33] <nshepperd2> if anything the larger the country the easier it should be, since your army size : border ratio is larger
[16:55:36] <kuudes> they require visa and they might not get it even for proper reasons
[16:55:39] <quanticle> It's a lot easier to set up detection and isolation when you have 4 million people versus 66 million
[16:55:47] <kuudes> close the border
[16:56:09] <kuudes> you just restrict so that no one but licence holders move across the border or to the border zone
[16:56:21] <quanticle> And then you lose all your international trade too
[16:56:39] <quanticle> Like, even NZ allows some foreigners to visit
[16:56:44] <quanticle> If it's "essential"
[16:57:34] <quanticle> If it's that easy, then why hasn't Finland done it?
[16:58:03] <nshepperd2> politics, aka fucking stupidity
[16:58:35] <kuudes> nz has not lost international trade afaik
[16:58:40] <kuudes> they still export and import stuff
[16:58:42] <kuudes> just not people
[16:58:44] *** Joins: MrFantastik (~Thunderbi@rrcs-184-74-43-235.nys.biz.rr.com)
[16:58:55] <kuudes> but they do export their normal stuff like meat and fruits etc
[16:59:11] <kuudes> and you can allow international businesspeople to travel through the quarantine system
[16:59:14] <kuudes> just not tourists
[16:59:36] <kuudes> and tourism seems to me in general parasitic business sector and we won't lose much if we lose that
[16:59:52] <kuudes> it seems to me that it gathers much more criminal elements than many other businesses
[17:00:48] <kuudes> quanticle, finland has not done it because for some reason we have a middle level party in the government where it can block stuff and for some reason it is in hold of some tourism companies
[17:01:12] <kuudes> and the right side and more of the parliament are due to wishful thinking
[17:01:36] <kuudes> finland had sort of this form of system now in winter and spring
[17:01:58] <kuudes> ie borders were basicly closed but for "essential" business, ie high paying business travel etc
[17:02:07] <kuudes> which has pissed estonia off
[17:02:38] <kuudes> because much of their economy is people from estonia working in finland and giving their salaries to their families who live in estonia

[17:05:43] <kuudes> the country has ammo and food, and it has some amount of tamiflu and relenza, but only for about 10% of population

[21:27:47] <gwern> I'm not sure how much it'll help. like my grandad's hearing aids (which he never, ever, ever uses) cost $5k. why? because he wasn't paying for them, did zero shopping around, took the first suggestion from the audiologist, and the VA paid for them. I paid for my hearing aids from costco, which are just as good, and they cost $2600 (and I could've gone down to $1k)
[21:28:49] <ggreer> my parents shop around and usually get their hearing aids from costco. still, the prescription and whatnot means that a lot of people with mild hearing loss (such as myself) don't bother with that stuff
