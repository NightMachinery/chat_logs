[00:04:30] <Guest94830> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[00:04:30] <Guest94830> Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
[00:04:30] <Guest94830> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination

[04:14:36] <Psi-Jack> I know Discord has that feature as well, though I think it's optional. Not sure if Matrix's ban makes it optional or just outright does it.

[10:04:49] <superboot> Hi all. I need to reinstall grub to the boot sector, but my system is booting a root that is on an mdadm RAID array. Is it safe to install to grub-install /dev/sda if sda is part of /dev/md0?

[10:13:02] <alkisg> Haxxa: the udev script won't have access to the user session and the running script; I'd go for plain polling in this case, i.e. dd, sync, udisksctl umount -b /dev/sdb, and then plain `test -e /dev/sd*` for a new device with sleep in a loop

[10:13:31] <Haxxa> alkisg Will it always be assigned the same block device name?
[10:13:54] <Haxxa> If so that would be trivial
[10:14:15] <Haxxa> Also should I use cat or dd?
[10:14:17] <alkisg> Haxxa: it's not guaranteed. If you do manage to pull it first, plug the second next, and it's not in use, then usually it does get the same device
[10:14:45] <alkisg> It's best to remember all the initial devices, and exclude them, to decide which one is new
[10:14:58] <alkisg> dd has a nice progress :)

[10:20:57] <alkisg> Just run your script in 4 tabs, but you'll also need one "lock file" in that case, to indicate which one is already writing and where
[10:21:22] <Disconsented> I'm trying to work out why periodically all inbound connections drop for about 5 minutes (at least anything), I assume this is a docker problem but I don't have a good way to narrow it down.
[10:21:24] <Haxxa> alkisg yeah that sounds reasonable
[10:21:58] <thad_the_man> Is there a way to set the home directory in a script, only for the lifetime of the script?
[10:22:32] <Haxxa> alkisg Do I need to worry about bash scripts overwriting the lock file at the same time, or is it Atomic i.e. write operations could not write to the same file

[15:29:49] <phogg> but ultimately the machine is only doing what the user asked for, one way or another. So, there must be some scenario in which you can compile a kernel to support EFI secure boot but decline to respect it in this regard.
[15:30:00] <phogg> might require a kernel recompile to achieve

There were no errors and modprobe worked OK this time, but unfortunately no device detected. lsmod reports the driver, but 0 uses. I am not sure this updated driver fixes anything. Will try the Mint IRC to see whether there is anything else one

[17:08:10] <relipse> So, we are in a situation where the OOM-killer killed mysql, the tables crashed and the website went down. This has happened 2 or 3 times within the past several months. I was told and came to the conclusion that we can do a few things: 1. upgrade from 8GB to 16gb, 2. take mysql and move it to its own dedicated server, 3. analyzie the code and see if there are any memory hogs. Is this normal in a lamp stack? Am I missing anything?

[17:21:49] <water_27300935_> 7z, bz2, tar.gz, tar.xz, zip, rar, which have best compression?
[17:22:09] <phogg> relipse: there are many things you can do from the client side, too. How you write queries will impact RAM usage, as well as the number of simultaneous connections.
[17:22:12] <Khaytsus> https://google.com/search?q=7z,+bz2,+tar.gz,+tar.xz,+zip,+rar,+which+have+best+compression?
[17:22:15] <ananke> water_27300935_: there are metric tons of comparisons on the web
[17:22:19] <phogg> water_27300935_: this is a matter of some debate
[17:22:47] <ananke> water_27300935_: also 'best compression' is a vague term, as it can be evaluated by different metrics. best in terms of what? compression ratio? speed?
[17:22:57] <Khaytsus> What's not under debate; this has nothing to do with Linux.  Use the googles.
[17:23:22] <phogg> water_27300935_: in general xz > bz2 > gz; zip and gz will be about the same, and 7z will be on par with xz. However, they ALL have different options for compression level. Also, what is best? Smallest size? Fastest compress? Fastest decompress?
[17:23:31] <jim> I lost my googles... anyone have a pair?
[17:23:41] <phogg> and by > I mean "is better than", meaning smaller size
[17:23:43] <hexnewbie> zip is often double the size of the tar.gz for me

[23:48:20] <phogg> hexnewbie: the longer you look at them the more you start thinking "I guess this wasn't intended to be used for anything"
[23:48:20] <hexnewbie> I mean, a creator tag would go in the xattr, not in an alternative data stream. Yeah, a full-blown alternative file contents going in a xattr would be just wrong, especially for large files

[23:49:00] <phogg> hexnewbie: I looked into them a few years ago so I could start doing image tagging without needing an external DB, and it's six tons of "nope"

[23:50:29] <hexnewbie> phogg: Well, using xattrs without a well-defined meaning might be less than useful, as no software would respect it. But they have their uses, like capability tags, etc.

[23:51:01] <codebam> is there a way to tell wsl not to mount or change or symlink anything but just chroot/vm/whatever into it?

[23:56:25] <meator> Hello. Does mp3 music on data CDs have to be 16 bit, stereo, 44.1 kHz like in audio CDs for it to be playable on a mp3 capable player?

[23:59:50] <phogg> meator: today what I would say is "don't worry about it"; most of the patents have expired and compatibility for MP3s is usually great on everything you can buy. If you already have the device you can test to be sure.
