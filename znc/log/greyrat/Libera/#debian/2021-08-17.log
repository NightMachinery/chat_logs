[03:31:12] <tomreyn> is there any initiative to come up with a better installer? maybe a rewrite? it works fine for the most part and is quite flexible in the scenarios it comvers, but it also takes a lot longer to go through than one might like (sure, there is also automation).
[03:32:22] <Khepra> rewrite? aren't you an ubuntu user. y'all changed how many installers now? that electron thing still on the canonical's TODO list?
[03:32:25] <tomreyn> i can't compare the code, but from a usability aspect i mostly like ubuntu's 'new' server installer now - aside from being a snap and doring in-place upgrades.

[03:38:16] <Khepra> tomreyn: I meant you're probably used to constant rewrites of the installer and think that'll happen to debian :)
[03:38:31] <Khepra> and subiquity is terribly inflexible, compared to debian's

[03:40:50] <Khepra> well there's ubiquity, rewrite of debian installer. then subiquity for servers, which is totally unfinished, and now canonical wants an electron thingy for the servers. am I wrong?
[03:40:57] <tomreyn> yes, subiquity is most likely less flexible, i didn't say it's perfect. it does work well for most scenarios i have by now, though
[03:41:08] <Khepra> and the liveUSB/CD that's also a separate installer methinks
[03:41:35] <tomreyn> i didn't mean to discuss Canonical, but Debian
[03:42:08] <Khepra> there's nothing wrong with debian installer to justify a rewrite. growing new functionality is always possible, yes.

[03:45:13] <Khepra> welp, it's missing RAID setup capabilities, BTRFS and ZFS maybe, but I'd say those are far beyond the needs of an average user, and totally doable from the installer in other ways (manual pre-configuration, or just plain debootstarp and avoid the installer)

[03:50:16] <tomreyn> those are features. sure, features matter, RAID still matters to many, i would think. it's great that debootstrap exists and is maintained, so you can always fall back to it. it's not what i'd want new users with somewhat advanced setups to have to fall back to.
[03:51:09] <tomreyn> but i guess this is getting philosophical now. thanks for your opionin, Khepra. If someone else has one, feel free to let me know, also by /msg
[03:51:23] <Khepra> tomreyn: are you volunteering to develop a new installer?
[03:51:43] <tomreyn> Khepra: did i say so?
[03:51:51] <Khepra> this sounds more facetious than it actually is. I'm just curious as to your intentions in this matter
[03:52:17] <tomreyn> i have no such plans, and moreover, most likely not the right mindset.
[03:52:23] <tomreyn> or capabilities
[03:53:25] <tomreyn> i'd be happy to contribute in the form of suggestions and bug testing, if soemone able to do such would take the initiative.
[03:53:30] <Khepra> I'm a programmer... pffft... 25 years now. in my experience, rewrites are usually terrible things unless you have very ancient codebases taht can't be gradually improved over time, in components
[03:53:51] <Khepra> somehow I think canonical's quest with, now, FOURTH iteration of an installer is kinda proof of that.
[03:54:24] <Khepra> so anway... if new features could be grown into the existing installer, or it's UI modified for better UX, sure why not, I suppose. but rewrites shoudl be the last option in the menu.

[05:36:00] <bsturmfels> hi folks, how would I find out what graphics driver is being used on my Debian Buster ppc64el system running sddm? I've tried stopping/starting sddm, but am not seeing anything in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[05:36:03] <cef> Q: Is there a channel for backports (here or OFTC)?
[05:36:20] <somiaj> !debian irc
[05:36:20] <dpkg> The offical Debian IRC network is OFTC (irc.oftc.net). Please connect to OFTC for debian support and development communities. See https://wiki.debian.org/IRC for a list of channels. See also <oftc>, <oftc move>, and <libera>.
[05:36:32] <somiaj> cef: ^^ that wiki has a list of channels, I don't recall if there is a backports one or not
[05:37:10] <somiaj> bsturmfels: /var/log/Xorg.0.log should be stating what video driver is being used. If in xorg, you can also try 'xvinfo' or 'glxinfo' for some info as well in a terminal
[05:37:35] <Khepra> bsturmfels: in addition to definitive clues in the xorg log, glxinfo from mesa-utils can tell you the "renderer string" that's being actually used
[05:37:51] <cef> @somiaj: Found it in there. #debian-backports (on OFTC). Ta. 
[05:38:03] <bsturmfels> thanks somiaj and Khepra

[05:42:23] <somiaj> I'm just unsure which display managers run as a user vs run as root
[05:43:30] <jmcnaught> journalctl might also be worth checking, and if the graphics card is PCI (I don't know ppc64el) "lspci -k" would show the kernel modules available and which one is in use.
[05:43:48] <bsturmfels> jmcnaught thanks!
[05:43:52] <somiaj> yea good call since most drivers are kms these days
[05:44:10] <somiaj> maybe lshw since not only does it tell you hardware, tells you kernel module that is loaded
[05:44:59] <Khepra> I would assume that sddm would always run as root as it needs to start the actual user session, ie. do the setuid/setgid
[05:45:30] <somiaj> some display managers are using a non root users, though since I don't use one I'm unsure about it
[05:45:46] <Khepra> that said, afaik only gdm can start non-root xorg sessions. dunno if sddm can. lightdm definitely can't.

[08:20:56] <rodolforg> Did some URL changed for APT source list for debian testing?
[08:22:25] <PMT> The -security URL changed, but that's for stable/bullseye.
[08:22:47] <PMT> !bullseye-security
[08:22:47] <dpkg> On Debian 11 "bullseye" systems, there are two repositories that you should have in your sources.list aside from your main mirror. You should have an entry for "bullseye-security" which is <security> updates and also "bullseye-updates" which is for <stable-updates>. See also <sources.list>. Note that you may also need to adjust your Default-Release and pinning settings for apt.
[08:23:03] <PMT> !sources.list
[08:23:03] <dpkg> A suitable /etc/apt/sources.list for "Bullseye" has three lines: "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main" "deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main". See <deb-src> <contrib> <non-free> <bullseye-updates> and `man sources.list`.
[08:24:01] <PMT> what message in particular are you getting that prompted the question, rodolforg 
[08:24:14] <rodolforg> PMT, I'm getting error messages like "failed to get http://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/InRelease"
[08:24:48] <PMT> Could you please put the full output on e.g. paste.debian.net or something and share that?
[08:25:09] <rodolforg> I was running from aptitude
[08:25:27] <rodolforg> from apt-get I got something more meaningful
[08:26:36] <somiaj> !bullseye/updates
[08:26:36] <dpkg> There is no "bullseye/updates" repository for security updates. To reduce confusion with <bullseye-updates> (which is for other bug fixes), security updates are distributed via the <bullseye-security> repository "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main". Note that you may also need to adjust your Default-Release and pinning settings for apt.
[08:26:44] <rodolforg> http://paste.debian.net/1207942/
[08:27:19] <rodolforg> PMT, http://paste.debian.net/1207942/
[08:29:12] <PMT> Ah, yes. The release happened, so now bullseye is stable and bookworm is testing. If you don't want a wild ride as packages start flooding into bookworm in the next little while, you might want to switch to just using bullseye, and use codenames and not stable/testing/etc in your sources.list unless you want to explicitly upgrade when this happens.
[08:29:40] <rodolforg> I always like to be on testing ;)
[08:30:03] <somiaj> Then you should use #debian-next on irc.oftc.net for support in the future

[12:50:01] <rudi_s> I have no swap on any of my servers/hosts and it works just fine ....
[12:50:13] <MrFooBar> until it doesn't
[12:50:23] <Khepra> it's not just opinion. it's a fact about how linux behaves with no swap when it thinks it needs it. no OOM poof gone process, but overall meltdown.
[12:50:34] <shad> I don't have a problem with that, just had ̀̀`glances` writing that in red and it started to freak me out
[12:50:51] <rudi_s> Khepra: It is opinion. But anyway.
[12:50:54] <jelly> shad, by default, debian's kernel is set to pretty aggresively put things on swap when it thinks they're not in use, and it uses that space for disk cache
[12:50:58] *** Joins: malloy (~jimery@116.30.220.55)
[12:51:02] <allan_wind> rudi_s: also, it doesn't hurt, to swap up stuff that is idle as it would give you more memory for things that would help like buffers
[12:51:08] <Khepra> shad: swap filling up is bad, it means you're overprovisioning RAM somewhere, so you definitely need more RAM. more swap is just termporary solution until you get more RAM.
[12:51:12] <shad> So this is normal behavior and swap being full full won't crash my whole production server ?
[12:51:46] <jelly> <shad> Swap is 1024M, whole server has 32Gb RAM with 7.8 being used right now

[12:51:58] <jelly> how is that "overprovisioning"

[12:52:18] <shad> Why ain't the swap emptying its contents by now
[12:52:24] <jelly> Khepra, two users, different issues with swap
[12:52:26] <Khepra> shad: because the pages in it are not needed yet
[12:52:39] <Khepra> jelly: hmm?
[12:53:08] <jelly> shad, pages already on swap do not get read back in until they're actually request (or a crazy admin does swapoff)

[12:54:07] <jelly> shad, no, no need to; linux kernel did that on its own.

[12:54:34] <jelly> if it annoys you, set swappiness to 1 and it will do that a _little_ less actively
[12:55:07] <Khepra> and keep in mind that with bullseye, swappiness now goes up to 200
[12:55:19] <jelly> does it now
[12:55:21] <Khepra> (actually with 5.8+ kernel, thus bullseye's 5.10)
[12:55:56] <jelly> even the default 60 is too aggressive
[12:55:58] <Khepra> jelly: yup. https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/5/20/1520
[12:56:06] <shad> so... no need to worry ? Feels like a warning light in the car that i don't know what it does
[12:56:27] <MrFooBar> shad: what is the swappiness value on that server?
[12:56:39] <Khepra> well based on your original question, you DO need to worry. 95% swap used means you need more RAM to satisfy the situations where swapping out ocurred
[12:56:52] <jelly> shad, fix your monitoring tools to tell you when there's lots of active change of swap, not when there's anything on swap
[12:57:00] <shad> MrFooBar: `cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness/:` 60
[12:57:24] <trysten> and in-memory
[12:57:31] <trysten> swap devices such as zswap.. wtf?
[12:57:45] <jelly> trysten, those are actually useful
[12:57:54] <trysten> cause compression?
[12:58:04] <MrFooBar> and performance
[12:58:11] <trysten> that's bizzare on it's face..
[12:58:26] <MrFooBar> :shrugs:
[12:58:26] <trysten> Why would you layer another system over the memory.. just use the memory.
[12:58:35] <jelly> compression (esp. zram+swap on it), and better latency (zswap)
[12:58:41] <Khepra> it is, but it's intermediate trade of "let's not use disk at the expense of some minor cpu cycles", which if overflown, still commit to disk
[12:58:46] <MrFooBar> yeah, the engineers that came to that solution must be stupid /s
[12:58:50] <jelly> maybe you don't have enough memory
[12:59:02] <trysten> jelly: zswap knows magic to make RAM faster? 
[12:59:06] <jelly> maybe you can't put in more right now
[12:59:13] <Khepra> it's like your room is a total mess and you need to free up space so you compress them into boxes, put on the shelves but if that's not enough, the boxes will be paged out to garage anyway
[12:59:29] <jelly> trysten, zswap knows magic to make itself faster than swap on SSD or HDD
[12:59:55] <Khepra> you know those things you can put into plastic bags and vacuum them? turn your big fluffy quilt or pillows into thin plates of cloth :)
[13:00:31] <jelly> +1 analogy
[13:00:42] <trysten> I must not understand swap in the first place. I thought it was a fallback to allow operations that exceed the memory of the machine
[13:01:17] <trysten> so it's purely compression! excellent. I like low memory systems
[13:01:18] <jelly> trysten, when you're already out of RAM, it's much faster to compress two pages into one, than to put it out to disk
[13:01:22] <Khepra> trysten: the idea is to free up physical RAM cells space for active pages
[13:01:51] <shad> That server workload is exclusively docker containers. Could that be that containers tried to use more memory than docker allocated to them, thus writing to swap ?
[13:01:58] <Khepra> so UNUSED ram sits at 200M. you can compress it to 96M. you've just freed up 104M without touching the disk. the heurstics of "unused" is maybe what's confusing you here.
[13:02:09] <shad> My monitoring on the last 30 days does not show RAM getting >100% and having to write to swap
[13:02:19] <trysten> Khepra: yeah, kinda. I feel like you can only say that once you have enough pages in the first place. If you just don't have enough pages, who cares about the active ones
[13:02:19] <Khepra> and then a wild glibc compilation process comes along. it needs MOAR free space. those 96M compressed are now page out to disk completely.
[13:02:21] <jelly> shad, unlikely, that would show as host RAM usage
[13:02:53] <trysten> Khepra: oh yeah, whatever "free" vs "unused" mean in terms of memory are not in my brain
[13:03:21] <Khepra> shad: keep in mind there can be short, transient situations where unused memory is paged out, but not paged in beacuse it's not needed yet. these transiet situations may happend between two runs of your grafana graphing
[13:03:52] <trysten> So.. I guess I'm surprised we have to resort to the swap and the kernel doesn't just compress the memory pages directly
[13:04:06] <jelly> it can't "directly"
[13:04:22] <jelly> compression implies indirection
[13:05:02] *** Quits: Haudegen (~quassel@178.115.237.87.static.drei.at) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:05:17] <jelly> the swap abstraction was an obvious and legit use to maintain hierarchy
[13:06:17] <trysten> I see. All of this is just because the apps are bad and use too much ram, right?
[13:06:36] <Khepra> not necessarily bad
[13:07:15] <Khepra> but yes they need RAM and kernel heuristics decide there's pages that haven't been touched yet, so they're swapped out, where "out" may be multi-stage compression first, then paging out to disk entirely if that's not enough
[13:08:11] <jelly> linux is used for different workloads that come in different sizes on machines with 128M to 4TB+ of RAM.  Tunables are there to fit a specific purpose

[13:08:41] <Khepra> python is a big mess in this regard becasue it never returns RAM to the OS, it internally rearranges it, so it can quickly lead to unused pages situation

[13:44:39] <jelly> !why apt
[13:44:39] <dpkg> apt is promoted over apt-get for interactive use. It uses fancy colors and has output format differences. It removes the .deb files that it downloads during an install or upgrade. It installs new packages during upgrades. apt-get has a stable command-line interface and is promoted for scripting.

[13:47:13] <amacater> Ah, OK
[13:47:18] <n4dir> i hate anything new, hence apt-get. Now as new things get old too, i am slowly moving from old-school to stoneage .

[13:48:32] <jelly> n4dir, udev?!  Bring me back my static /dev
[13:49:20] <n4dir> well, yeah, but, the brutal truth, i did never really know what udev is at all. There is eudev, and there is chat about it, but i never really cared.
[13:49:20] <jelly> and kernels with modules on the side... what craziness is this.  Everyone knows you build a kernel for the machine you run it on.
[13:49:34] <amacater> and dpkg --get-selections > file ; dpkg --set-selections < file is still the fastest way to transfer the list of packages installed from one machine (or one architecture) to another.

[14:02:23] <Khepra> can you pastebin the crypttab and actual output of running update-initramfs  ?
[14:02:36] <aminvakil> how can i have an exact command which gives me 7.3 on buster and 7.4 on bullseye to retrieve installed php? does anyone have a better idea than this?
[14:02:37] <aminvakil> php --version | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut -f1,2 -d'.'

[14:05:21] <plantroon> I wonder how do I "force" it to include crypto modules ... like ... what are its decisions based on? I have "MODULES=most" in initramfs.conf, so I assumed it would build a very generic initramfs.

[14:20:14] <aminvakil> Khepra: it was explicitly 7.3 until i added bullseye to test :)

[17:09:33] <Khepra> I thought you said above you tried parted. "name" command of parted is trying to set _partition_ label which won't work for msdos layout
[17:09:58] <darsie> That was with a different device for testing.
[17:11:01] <darsie> Should I unmount the device for renaming?
[17:11:18] <Khepra> I don't think you can put partlabels on msdos partitions, can you?
[17:12:18] <Khepra> so note,   "parted label" is partition layout table, nothing to do with labelling that you want. further,   partlabel (partition label) is not the same as filesystem label. you were so far trying filesystem label on to a FAT
[17:12:38] <Khepra> effin confusing, but that's how it is
[17:13:03] <darsie> My 4 GB usb drive gets mounted to /media/bernhard/USB DISK, though.
[17:13:27] <Khepra> is that the _filesystem_ label?
[17:13:34] <xx> seemed to work after reboot...
[17:13:35] <darsie> idk
[17:13:48] <xx> great, yet another thing where editing a config file requires a reboot afterwards

[17:22:46] <darsie> Yeah, I noticed that, which is why I started testing with some other device.
[17:22:56] <Khepra> darsie: no idea about hpfs, ntfs can be relabelled with ntfslabel, and FAT allegedly with dosfstools' fatlabel and tha tother thing. _Why_ it fails like you posted earlier, no idea.

[19:12:28] <cadmio> so that one
[19:12:29] <tesseract> and after that you can install whatever package you need
[19:12:32] <Khepra> that was going to be my further suggestion; and then install one by one package that you want
[19:12:44] *** Joins: lad (~lad@user/lad)
[19:13:33] <Khepra> the approach does require you to know what you're doing tho as some things won't automatically install. the choice of DM for example. and software installed for xfce DE can be tuned too
[19:14:57] <jaguart> cadmio: minimal in Debian is **very** minimal - you probably want to go with **recommends** - you get what most users would expect

[19:15:36] *** Joins: rockworld (~rockworld@user/rockworld)
[19:15:46] <Khepra> that really depends. for example, I prefer to install with recommends configured out, and then install them deliberately, after understanding what they do
[19:16:04] <Khepra> as an example, smartmontools pulling in entire Exim MTA due to recommends is really ridiculous
[19:16:28] <Khepra> ESPECIALLY since for a numer of those you can satisfy the _intended_ "recommends" relationship with lighter software, eg. by having dma instead of Exim
[19:16:41] *** Quits: bsturmfels (~sturm@mediagoblin/maintainer/bsturmfels) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:16:55] <Khepra> so. if you want most minimal as possible, install without recommends and then install deliberately only tha what you really need
[19:17:05] <jaguart> kephra: that's wnat I used to do - until I found too many things just don't quite work as expected - and manually selecting things for install means they never get auto-removed when you upgrade
[19:17:12] <ansgar> Pretty much anything pulling in a mail server seems ridiculous. It's not helpful for most desktop systems.
[19:17:38] <Khepra> jaguart: yes, taht's the part about "understanding" what you're doing
[19:17:42] <ansgar> And as it requires explicit configuration, it's not helpful to just install a MTA anywhere else either.
[19:17:45] <cadmio> Khepra: so for example 'apt-get install icewm --no-install-recommends' ?
[19:18:03] <Khepra> you can always document in a README.txt, things you installed that were "recommended", and why you installed them, for future reference and easy removal

[19:43:06] <cadmio> with the NET image I've dowloaded (the Xfce one) I could decide to install only X and icewm, and avoid installing Xfce?
[19:43:22] <jelly> xx, the reason is knowing which version misbehaved, because debian can sometimes apply functional patches
[19:44:08] <jelly> that's why the string embeds package version and revision
[19:44:36] <Khepra> and it's embedded in KEX, and the only configurable side is server side. 
[19:44:40] <joepublic> cadmio, essentially, yes.  You probably want to install first with no desktop at all, then on first or subsequent boot, install the X window system and icewm.
[19:45:04] <n4dir> cadmio: perhaps with some not well known voodoo, the usual way to do such would be the one describe by joepublic already
[19:45:24] <Khepra> also consider whether you want a DM or  exec startx  from console login

[20:51:24] <ansgar> Using the ssh.socket unit that Debian ships is just like starting sshd via inetd; I don't think it will matter much in most cases.
[20:52:00] <xx> I just want to test it "for fun" because the socket thing looks neat and I might learn something
[20:52:02] <jelly> ansgar, is it?  I thought the master sshd would keep running once it's started
[20:52:24] <xx> oh and once it is started, then the sshd just keeps on running forever?
[20:52:29] <Khepra> that's another issue, the service must support that mode  and exit on idle
