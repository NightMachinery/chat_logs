[00:58:29] <Robomot> [Astral Codex Ten] Heuristics That Almost Always Work - https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/heuristics-that-almost-always-work
[00:58:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> So. Seems to me like Scott is missing something here
[00:59:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Take the example of the security guard in the Pillow Mart in Topeka, Ohio, for whom any noise is the wind, and not robbers, 99.9% of the time, because nobody wants to rob a Pillow Mart in Topeka, Ohio
[01:00:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is true, no one does, but... then the Pillow Mart is not actually going to have a security guard, are they?
[01:00:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who's gonna hire a security guard for a place that gets robbed, in expectation, less than once every two decades?
[01:00:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heck they might not even have an alarm system...
[01:01:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if we observe that a security guard actually is there (and this includes the case where "we" are the security guard himself), we cannot but conclude that either the actual robbery rate is probably higher, OR there's something else going on, like maybe the security guard is there for some other reason - who knows what?
[01:02:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Similarly, who ever heard of a doctor whose patients have nothing 99.9% of the time? Who would go to doctors if that's how it was?
[01:03:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then the skeptic - a 99.9% success rate? But Scott you just gave us a real-world example where the skeptic got it wrong one time out of three!
[01:04:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> In short, I am not prepared to believe that there are all these examples where heuristics are right *that* often but *there still exist people whose job it is to check all the time*

[01:07:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, exactly
[01:08:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Clearly the actual robbery chance is maybe not 0.01%
[01:08:33] <ggreer> which seems more difficult than robbing a pillow store. then they murdered the store owners to eliminate witnesses to the robbery
[01:08:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> My point is that it would be weird and implausible for the robbery rate to be that low AND simultaneously for there to be a security guard there 24/7
[01:08:56] <ggreer> yeah but scott is using hyperbole
[01:09:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> But how much hyperbole, is the question
[01:09:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm saying it's so much hyperbole that it in fact undermines his point.

[01:14:45] <Dyo> made some pizzas; first time without any rolling, pull only. made bigger difference than expected, dough got thin enough to burn easily. also used bread flour only. most ppl online recommend bread flour for pizza, guess pizza flour is just rebranded pasta flour.
[01:15:17] <Dyo> also made a rolling pin, which is now a bit useless lol.
[01:16:38] <Dyo> well not quite but I don't bake much apart from pizza, cheesecake and lasagna
[01:18:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nice
[01:18:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> What toppings? Or just cheese

[01:19:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> ^ yep
[01:20:09] <Dyo> pre-bakes actually. I bake them for 1:30 to 2 min at 300C (i.e. slightly longer than it takes to stretch one doughball to pizza format), then freeze them. for topping I mostly like plain mozzarella with a bit of olive oil (bianco) or crushed tomatoes with little or no cheese (rossa).

[01:21:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Interesting about the pre-baking, so basically you end up with something like supermarket frozen pizzas (but better obviously)
[01:21:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Do you put the toppings on there after pre-baking and before freezing too?
[01:21:38] <Dyo> the mozzarella is shredded and mix of low fat and normal, the crushed tomatoes are raw, mildly pureed and sieved in a hair sieve to reduce moisture a bit more (without movement, just in and out else I'd just get finer tomato puree).
[01:22:50] <Dyo> nah I only freeze the dough. my freezer is standard so would destroy the texture.
[01:23:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> ah
[01:23:52] <Dyo> the dough already has oven spring that way, so I can finish it in the oven at 260-300¬∞C or in the microwave as it has a pizza setting. it's not quite as good as fresh but a lot less work that way.
[01:25:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh hmm
[01:25:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's quite a bit cooler than the usual pizza baking temps!
[01:26:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> What dough recipe do you use
[01:26:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it the Serious Eats one? Or different
[01:27:17] <Dyo> for the dough I go for 70-75% hydration. 1kg flour + 650g water + 10ish g salt, mixed a bit then resting for a few hours, ideally below room temp. then add yeast +50-100g water, pinch of sugar. wait 1-3h for bubbles to form, then fridge ~20h. remove from fridge, wait 1-2h, form and bake
[01:28:55] <Dyo> yeah my oven is not a specific pizza oven. I use 300C convection+broiler (another 15C or so) and move the rack close to the top so there's just enough space to insert the pizza. I also use some aluminum to plates on the rack for better heat transfer+capacity.
[01:29:34] <Dyo> the broiler is great for toppings tho, especially cheese
[01:32:26] <Dyo> hm I don't remember which particular recipe its based on. maybe something from Tom Lehmann. I did one from serious eats once but I think that was either sauce or a deep dish
[01:32:58] <Dyo> exact same dough is also great for baguettes
[01:35:21] <Dyo> for flour I use mostly 1050, 405+1050 1:1 or 90% of the former + 10% whole grain or corn flour. haven't tried winter wheat yet. 405 is plain white all purpose flour, wholegrain is ~1600 (mineral content after burning) so 1050 is a heavier bread flour.
[01:37:07] <Dyo> and like I mentioned I don't knead much. a bit after adding the yeast, just to get everything mixed well, and of course while forming the dough balls, apart from that the rising action generates enough gluten. in a weak flour some vitamin c can be added, as you already know.
[01:38:48] <Dyo> I also tried adding probiotic bacteria, but it either makes no difference or they were old/dead already.

[04:18:15] <quanticle> adiabatic: Would be interesting to see the people who liked self-driving also were Waze users before they got into self-driving.
[04:18:46] <gwern> looking up connectionist researchers is weird. sometimes it's like, "they died 50 years ago in a boating accident", other times it's, "they died last year", and finally sometimes it's like "they're 85 years old and the creators of the most popular Coursera course of all time"

[04:19:54] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:23:01] <quanticle> Well, sort of. What I'm trying to get at is whether there's some kind inherent "trust the computer" sense that people who like self-driving have, which people who dislike self-driving don't. I'm recalling my experience using Waze when I lived in Bellevue. Waze was great, it did work as advertised, but it required you to trust its directions without question. I remember what got me to stop using
[04:23:03] <quanticle> Waze was when, on my way back from work, it put me onto the (very busy) I-405, going through the center of Bellevue. I was thinking, "What the heck? This is the middle of rush hour and you're putting me on the freeway?" And sure enough I could see the traffic jam forming up ahead when I got on the freeway. But Waze knew better. Right as I was coming up on the traffic jam, it said, "Take the next
[04:23:05] <quanticle> exit," routed me down onto a different city street, and then got me home via a different route.
[04:23:27] <quanticle> And that was when I realized there was no way I could ever trust Waze enough to use it routinely
[04:23:44] <gwern> you can't look at the planned route?
[04:23:55] <quanticle> The planned route changes!
[04:24:19] <gwern> so it was going to take you through the jam
[04:24:22] <adiabatic> I figure they have both the same trust-the-computer sense. The pro-self-driving guy thinks of it as "would you rather driving be something you do, or something you supervise?" and leans towards the latter
[04:24:27] <quanticle> You hear this chirp noise, and boom, waze has recalculated a route through someone's front-yard or something

[05:03:47] <gwern> pfft, there's plenty of horrifying foodstuffs out there; like fugu. just gotta prepare it right
[05:05:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The gelatinous cube is an original invention of Gary Gygax, rather than being inspired by outside sources and adapted to the roleplaying setting ... Being a cube that is a perfect ten feet on each side, it is specifically and perfectly "adapted" to its native environment, the standard, 10-foot (3.0 m) by 10-foot (3.0 m) dungeon corridors which were ubiquitous in the earliest Dungeons & Dragons modules.[1]"
[05:05:47] <gwern> at last, we found the Evolutionary Environment of Adaptedness!
[05:05:52] <gwern> it is truly the perfect predator
[05:06:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> The great thing about the gelatinous cube is that it seems like it should be so easy to defeat: after all, it has no ranged attacks and moves very slowly, so can't you just *get out of the way*?
[05:06:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> But no. You can't. You absolutely, 100% can't.
[05:07:31] <gwern> terrifying in its simplicity and perfection. the first predator, and the last.

[05:13:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Actually there was this one great Pathfinder adventure by Monte Cook
[05:13:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where at one point, massive chunks of slime start falling from the sky
[05:13:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> And when they land, they animate and attack people
[05:13:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Everyone's like "wtf is this shit"
[05:13:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> After an investigation it's revealed that the attacking monsters are... gelatinous non-cubes.
[05:14:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're gelatinous cubes but in non-cubical form.
[05:14:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not some other kind of slime or ooze, mind you!
[05:14:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Very specifically: gelatinous non-cubes.
[05:14:37] <gwern> unnatural
[05:14:41] <gwern> I blame a wizard
[05:14:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Naturally

[05:16:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[05:16:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> For sure
[05:16:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> But *very* evil.
[05:16:45] <gwern> quanticle: I think we're being too hasty in blaming the cats. we're only hearing from their enemies
[05:17:04] <gwern> maybe if we heard from these cats it'd turn out to be a big misunderstanding. the extra-dimensional cats did nothing wrong!
[05:17:10] <quanticle> Well, you never know, they might be like those horrible sphinx cats
[05:17:43] <quanticle> gwern: I predict that these interdimensional evil cats meow cutely and roll over and do the noodle thing
[05:17:47] <quanticle> And then we'd forgive them
[05:17:51] <gwern> sphinx cats are victims, not evil
[05:20:08] <quanticle> Also, how does one distinguish a gelatinous (non)cube from other varieties of slime monster?
[05:20:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: What I'm hearing from you is that you don't trust the experts' judgment
[05:20:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shameful
[05:21:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Those slimes were inspected and the consensus was that they were gelatinous non-cubes
[05:21:01] <rmmh> gwern: like the cats in Madoka! 
[05:21:25] <gwern> the space cats did nothing wrong. megucas are just whiny girls

[05:24:38] <quanticle> rmmh: Also, if we're talking about giant slime monsters, those have been a staple of sci fi and horror since at least the '50s: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051418/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2

[07:59:06] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, I am still using ii. I think I've learned my lesson
[07:59:36] <rmmh> ii is a minimalist FIFO and filesystem-based IRC client. It creates an irc directory tree with server, channel and nickname directories. In every directory a FIFO in file and a normal out file is created. The in file is used to communicate with the servers and the out files contain the server messages. For every channel and every nickname there are related in and out files created. This allows
[07:59:38] <rmmh> IRC communication from command line and adheres to the Unix philosophy.

[10:56:59] <quanticle> It didn't used to be worse, but then what happened was that stores realized that they didn't need to be stores, but could be fancy-ass showrooms instead.
[10:57:45] <quanticle> Like, for example, in my local home depot, they've removed literally a dozen aisles or so in order to make space for refrigerator and snowblower displays

[10:58:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Just so. I found it rather tricky to do that "lift it out" step at first - I found myself having to do these weird arm contortions and perpetually risking the whole cake tumbling to the floor or something - until I figured out this trick: carefully center the pan (with bottom, and cake, inside) on top of a wide-mouth Mason jar, and then sort of slide the pan downward (the aperture in the bottom being a good deal
[10:58:20] <Obormot\Arcturus>  wider than the jar circumference); the result is that the rim is sitting on your table, around the jar bottom, while the bottom (with cake atop it) is balanced on the jar
[10:58:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Some other similarly-sized cylindrical object can be substituted for the jar, obviously)
[11:00:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Indeed a somewhat wider cylinder - something only a *little* narrower than the pan's bottom aperture - would be even better, but the jar does the trick for now)

[12:45:47] <synthmeat> lol
[12:46:11] <quanticle> I don't understand why the German government declared natural gas to be "sustainable". Like... is this all an elaborate exercise to extricate themselves from their disastrous decision to shut down their nuclear power plants?
[12:46:19] <feep[work]> quanticle
[12:46:31] <feep[work]> they really like natural gas and coal, and they had to ditch coal
[12:46:38] <quanticle> Ohhhhhhh
[12:46:41] <feep[work]> there is no logic here, it's pure investment politics
[12:46:58] <saturn2> it's an elaborate exercise to pretend that it wasn't a stupid decision
[12:46:58] <quanticle> Right, I forgot that Germany had giant coal mines
[12:47:11] <feep[work]> I think the background was that they made a deal with france where france got to declare nuclear power sustainable if germany got gas
[12:47:35] <feep[work]> I don't think they expect anyone to take this seriously
[12:47:43] <quanticle> I mean, I'm okay with that compromise, because initially nuclear was going to be excluded from the list of "sutainable" energy sources.
[12:47:45] <feep[work]> like, they don't see this as a consumer relevant label
[12:47:58] <feep[work]> even tho it primarily is

[12:49:51] <kuudes> I hope meta leaves europe but I am pessimistic
[12:50:02] <quanticle> Okay, that makes a lot more sense. Well, let me rephrase. It still doesn't make sense, but I can see the bureaucratic logic.
[12:50:25] <kuudes> the narrative for sustainable natural gas was that it is less bad than coal
[12:50:29] <kuudes> or oil
[12:50:38] <feep[work]> which tbf it is
[12:50:40] <kuudes> light green or whatever

[12:51:14] <quanticle> You declare natural gas as "sustainable" and then you can build new natural gas plants because you fucked yourself by shutting down your nuclear power plants, and you can do so with emergency spending
[12:51:15] <kuudes> I am for the current nuclear compromise, ie that it is sustainable if you have proven hot to dispose of it

Movement around this axis ‚Ä¶)

[22:01:42] <PapuaHardyNet> If being autistic means you cannot read subtle situations fast enough, but can analyze it given enough time and mental compute, the simplest solution is to generate a "rainbow table" of reactions to situations and memorize it

[22:02:45] <two2thehead> and some more-self-aware males as well
[22:03:24] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't create rainbow tables, but I do spend an unordinate amount of time trying to understand a social situation after-the-fact
[22:03:48] <two2thehead> it depends. I know a bunch of them. It ranges from hyperfocusing on generating those rainbow tables for those who are 'less' autistic, to just giving up for those who are 'more'
[22:04:54] <PapuaHardyNet> giving up doesn't make sense, but I guess I don't understand people more neuroatypical than I am
[22:05:16] <PapuaHardyNet> but hey, thanks for throwing some light onto that situation

[22:15:05] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. perhaps people do play roles and I am the outlier
[22:15:06] <feep> I play a role.
[22:15:11] <gwern> ~breaking out of the state machine, accessing uninitialized memory, seizing the means of computation, and escaping into base reality~
[22:15:15] <feep> sorta
[22:15:18] <feep> well, somewhat
[22:15:25] <feep> maybe 30%
[22:15:37] <feep> a more neutral term may be codeswitching
[22:15:43] <pompolic> possibly
[22:16:13] <feep> I don't tend to roleplay preferences.
[22:16:16] <PapuaHardyNet> oh. oh yeah then I codeswitch too. hell, I can recognize people codeswitching and adjust accordingly
[22:16:20] <pompolic> discarding the term "roles", then: i found from experience that people act in predictable ways in certain contexts
[22:16:43] <pompolic> easy examples are for example "convenience store clerk"
[22:16:46] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: perfect, I agree. people have "shell scripts" they follow, that they iteratively build and improve
[22:16:55] <pompolic> yep
[22:17:05] <pompolic> there are also social scripts like "father" "distant relative"
[22:17:10] <pompolic> also with some predictabilities
[22:17:53] <PapuaHardyNet> also social norms enforce these social scripts and teach them through the ostracism or criticism caused when you violate those norms
[22:17:56] <pompolic> i can't just perform these scripts without introspection/explicit thinking about it. internal experience looks like there being so many options not knowing which one to pick
[22:18:12] <pompolic> i *assume* people don't see as many options as i do
[22:18:21] <pompolic> yeah that too
[22:18:30] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: you feel free though, right? I feel freer and more unfettered than other people, and yet more alone
[22:18:38] <feep> pompolic: yeah I generally see one option
[22:19:03] <feep> it's not a task of choosing, it's two steps: finding the one option that is correct, and detecting mistakes before they slip out
[22:19:27] <feep> when I find the option I generally recognize that it is correct
[22:19:37] <pompolic> interactions that blow up in my face are like...performing a move i didn't know was "illegal"
[22:19:42] <PapuaHardyNet> lol
[22:20:12] <pompolic> e.g. they go up against a local norm, or just signal allegiance i didn't mean to and they assume i am actually saying that
[22:20:31] <feep> pompolic: yeah it's a strong system1/system2 thing, the system1 will output an "illegal"/bad option and sys2's job is to notice before I say it
[22:20:40] <PapuaHardyNet> afaict the best way to know what options are open to you to get what you want is to simulate the audience in your head and that is HARD
[22:20:41] <pompolic> yeah i was going to say
[22:20:51] <pompolic> learning more of the territory "restricts" the options
[22:20:58] <pompolic> but it's still not a system1 thing
[22:21:13] <pompolic> for the most part anyway? i think i'm getting confused
[22:21:15] <feep> yeah person knowledge is a really strong part of it
[22:21:22] <rmmh> #justntthings
[22:21:38] <feep> I want the state of the conversational participants to reach a goalstate, and I just ask my system1 for the actions that get it there
[22:21:46] <feep> it's fundamentally navigational
[22:21:50] <pompolic> system1 restricts options that anticipate pain, but even then it's not outside my awareness
[22:22:04] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder if I can train the ability to constantly simulate the other person in an interaction in my head. it would improve my social skills by 10x
[22:22:05] <feep> so it's like "which steps do you take?" you just walk towards the target
[22:22:29] <pompolic> elsewhere i was just explaining how executing strategies feels like navigation, neat
[22:22:40] <feep> and as I understand autism, part of it is being unable to see the target in the conversational space
[22:22:41] <pompolic> i wonder if this has to do with Yudkowsky's "consequentialism"
[22:22:57] <feep> or rather, maybe, to see the current position
[22:22:59] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: the target? what do you mean?
[22:23:16] <feep> like, rn the target is "the chat understands where I am coming from" (this is usually the target)
[22:23:41] <pompolic> i am personally probably ignorant on both, generally
[22:23:42] <feep> and I am theorizing which parts of "the state of understanding me" are missing in yall's heads
[22:23:52] <pompolic> this, i expect would translate into "so many options i don't know what to pick"
[22:24:02] <feep> and then I order these parts by dependency and say them :D
[22:24:22] <pompolic> love 2 play aptitude in my head just so say things
[22:24:23] <feep> (this is how I get through almost every conversation)
[22:24:39] <feep> yeah exactly
[22:24:55] <pompolic> figuring out a linear embedding (?) of the dependency graph is hard :(
[22:25:15] <feep> well, it's not usually pathological
[22:25:24] *** Joins: Filipepe (~Filipepe@2804:14d:5ca3:8ebe:2c8a:e08a:3ded:de79)
[22:25:27] <PapuaHardyNet> when you put it that way, it sounds like you are running a ton of computation, but I guess it feels automatic and non-conscious
[22:25:42] <feep> you just pick one piece, check if any prerequs are in the missing set, if so randomly pick one of those (there's strategies here, too), iterate until you hit a root
[22:25:48] <feep> this is usually after two or three steps
[22:26:07] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: sorta half/half
[22:26:26] <PapuaHardyNet> oh thank god, here I am thinking you put in as much mental effort into conversations as I put into roguelikes
[22:26:43] <feep> it's like alphago, the tree search runs in sys2 but I often pick the right option first cause of the sys1 heuristics driving the search
[22:27:19] <feep> and of course, if you pick the wrong option sometimes it's nbd
[22:27:58] <feep> failure is a necessary step of the learning process etc
[22:28:11] <Filipepe> hi fip
[22:28:15] <feep> hihi
[22:28:17] <Filipepe> and paps
[22:28:30] <PapuaHardyNet> I see. this means you implicitly model people
[22:28:36] <feep> weeell
[22:28:39] <feep> I generally model one person XD
[22:28:46] <PapuaHardyNet> I actually do not implicitly model people, I implicitly end up modelling archetypes of people
[22:28:51] <feep> plus like... like ten people I have patches for.
[22:29:01] <PapuaHardyNet> who is that one person?
[22:29:06] <feep> "people"
[22:29:18] <feep> like, the archetype
[22:29:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, so you also have an archetype in your head
[22:29:28] <feep> yeah
[22:29:43] <feep> being able to codeswitch really helps
[22:30:00] <feep> being able to codeswitch really helps with that, cause then you can model people as codeswitching the "standard person"
[22:30:16] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, yeah I agree
[22:30:47] <ggreer> https://brandur.org/fragments/single-dependency-stacks everything is postgres? interesting
[22:30:47] <Robomot> Single dependency stacks ‚Äî brandur.org
[22:30:59] <PapuaHardyNet> so does this mean I should simply try to make a few hundred code-switches per person and per state of the person, for all the most common people I interact with? no, perhaps actually simulating people is better
[22:31:21] <feep> I'd try to get the standard person interaction unpatched safe, first
[22:31:23] <feep> idk.
[22:31:27] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, good conversation feep, pompolic. Lots of things I can think about.
[22:31:36] <feep> yay~
[22:32:21] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: I save a lot of effort by having like a ... conversational bootstrap early in the conversation. "oh yeah this person is like that"
[22:32:31] <feep> this gets cached once I have lots of interaction
[22:32:51] <feep> in irc you can do this by reading the backlog :D
[22:33:29] * feep has a bootstrap mode for "is autistic" for this channel, ofc

[22:39:06] <pompolic> yep
[22:39:17] <pompolic> but also not
[22:40:26] <pompolic> feep: i think my embedding is kiiind of pathological actually. i end up talking in circles a lot
[22:40:43] *** Joins: _inky (~inky_@141.136.78.37)
[22:40:50] <feep> having a hard time imagining that
[22:41:00] <pompolic> i'd characterize it as
[22:41:16] <pompolic> i start working the graph into text, going from one node to another
[22:41:33] <pompolic> and not realizing i visited a node already (or if i do, i think i found a better way to say it)
[22:41:45] <pompolic> but zooming out, it tends to look more like saying the same thing
[22:42:49] <pompolic> arguably the content of the node is less important in the first place than the structure of how they fit together
[22:43:18] <feep> oh right, lack of stack depth
[22:43:48] <feep> pompolic: yeah if I'm explaining a huge graph, I try to explicitly split it into topical sections
[22:44:37] <pompolic> yeah i suppose FSM vs PDA (pushdown-automata) is a relevant distinction
[22:44:47] <pompolic> the latter has a stack
[22:45:36] <feep> it doesn't quite feel stacky
[22:45:37] <pompolic> interestingly i remember having a conversation stack, and i even sometimes say "unwinding the stack, i wanted to get back to X", but saying things doesn't seem to work that way
[22:45:55] <feep> yeah you have to like, actively manage the listener's cache state
[22:46:12] <pompolic> how horrifying
[22:46:17] <PapuaHardyNet> which ties into "emulate the person"
[22:46:18] <feep> make point 1 to completion, preferably deliver value, put it aside, do point 2, refresh the conclusion of point 1, link into point 3...
[22:46:45] <feep> it is not super much explicit computation, but it is definitely a lot of state to hold.
[22:46:52] <PapuaHardyNet> you also need to actively manage their emotional state
[22:47:02] <pompolic> uh
[22:47:05] <feep> moooostly not an issue for the people I talk to
[22:47:09] <PapuaHardyNet> something I am so bad at, I'm sure animals are better at it than I am
[22:47:10] <pompolic> i think that's manipulative
[22:47:25] <feep> nah, that's necessary, but only if you're like, talking to unstable individuals
[22:47:26] <pompolic> if someone demands their emotional state to be managed, that's probably even more so
[22:47:44] <PapuaHardyNet> nonono
[22:48:18] <PapuaHardyNet> what I mean is like - there are extroverted individuals who are high energy and have a set of behaviors they expect as positive and stuff right? when you don't show that, they get uncertain and defensive

[22:50:11] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: yeah that's codeswitching for me
[22:50:32] <kuudes> emotional work, in feminism terms
[22:50:34] <feep> cause like, I *am* excited, it's just a matter of expressing it legibly

[22:52:35] <Robomot> Geoff Greer (@ggreer): "Are you willing to wager money on this? I'll bet up to $500 that before 2022/04/01, San Francisco will end its indoor mask mandate. / (I chose SF b/c of the blue state/city governance. If some other criteria more accurately reflects your statement, I'm happy to entertain that bet.)"
[22:52:37] <Robomot> London Breed (@LondonBreed): "Starting February 16 in San Francisco, vaccinated people will no longer be required to wear masks in most indoor settings, including restaurants, bars, gyms, grocery stores, offices, museums, and other locations. The unvaccinated will still be required to wear masks indoors."
[22:52:45] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, well, it seems about obvious to me that people do, and women are more in roles where that is the good to be served
[22:52:55] <pompolic> this is bad: people don't not notice, and also it compromises integrity
[22:53:33] <gwern> ggreer: hm. what about the unvaccinated mandate?
[22:54:05] <gwern> it seems to me that the unvaccinated mandate is the face-saving excuse (as it has been in places where the whole mandate is dropped and stores signal "we require masks for the unvaccinated")
[22:54:12] <gwern> so it might be in place basically forever
[22:54:17] <ggreer> not sure how long that will stick around for. it's not enforced
[22:54:24] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: I see it as feep does: a way to help other people understand what you are communicating - but! your situation is atypical and of course, one where you were forced to do emotinoal work. Not something one should be forced to do, yeah
[22:54:24] <gwern> yes, but then it's not 'ended'
[22:55:04] <pompolic> PapuaHardyNet: yeah. what i meant to communicate here is: "personally i probably have a bias towards assuming the other party is going to flip out if i say the wrong thing"
[22:55:55] <pompolic> also, >tfw you're vaxed but you don't want to deal with the whole infrastructure around proving you're vaccinated
[22:55:58] <pompolic> :(
[22:56:51] <rmmh> >tfw you're vaxed but your kids lost your vax card
[22:56:54] <ggreer> I've never used my vaccine card. the one time I had to prove my vaccination status, I'd forgotten it in my car. I ended up using a stupid app
[22:57:01] <pompolic> i do a mental search-replace on "unvaccinated" to "not legibly vaccinated to enforcer entity"
[22:57:09] <pompolic> but i'm fairly sure this is a problem unique to me
[22:57:16] <gwern> thus far the only time I've used my vaccine card is when I go in for another vaccine
[22:57:40] <Betawolf> vaccinated to protect yourself from the virus, won't show a vax passport to protect yourself from the government
[22:57:46] <pompolic> belgium has the "covid safe ticket" meaning you have to sign up for their super special identity platform to be able to prove vaccination
[22:57:56] <pompolic> and as far as i can tell restaurants etc. still enforce CST
[22:58:35] <pompolic> Betawolf: for real though. i think eigenrobot said this is a Type of Guy and i find myself on the bingo card
[22:58:56] <kuudes> apparently moscow has started to deny medical treatment for unvaccinated
[22:59:11] <Betawolf> such leaders in civil rights
[22:59:30] <kuudes> personally I would be for still vaccinating people with 6 doses
[22:59:41] <kuudes> and then maybe making that mandatory if that stops local spread
[23:00:14] <kuudes> another schelling point could be 1 janssen dose minimum so that people won't crowd out icus
[23:00:25] <kuudes> another is voluntary vaccination
[23:00:53] <kuudes> if you have a mandatory vaccination, it seems the proper supervising for that is the police, not private parties
[23:01:07] <kuudes> or maybe tax office or something
[23:01:15] <ggreer> oregon is ending its mask mandate no later than march 31st: https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORDHS/bulletins/3098e7d
[23:01:15] <Robomot> Oregon will lift indoor mask requirements no later than March 31
[23:01:38] <kuudes> we still have not had a mask nor vaccine mandate
[23:01:41] <ggreer> annoyingly the governor of washington hasn't said anything concrete. it'd be really annoying if washington was the last state to end it
[23:02:04] <kuudes> even though the government legally could instantiate such with bare executive statute
[23:02:26] <ggreer> it's not really enforced outside of the seattle area. everywhere else, people are fed up
[23:03:06] <kuudes> I guess in usa I could see gated communities requiring proof of vaccination?
[23:04:04] <ggreer> probably won't happen, but there's no law preventing a community from doing that
[23:04:09] <kuudes> hoas
[23:04:41] <kuudes> currently there is not much use of your neighbours being vaccinated, but in some other configurations there could be use
[23:04:54] <kuudes> measles vaccination for instance is useful
[23:05:00] <spxtr> ggreer: no way california isn't last.
[23:05:13] <ggreer> california is ending the mask mandate in a week
[23:05:28] <spxtr> holy smokes, what about the counties though

[23:15:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Hm. It seems like it would even be possible to use this like we use Wikipedia's API currently, i.e. as an external annotation source - retrieving the HTML (which seems fairly well-structured), custom-rewriting a bit, and presenting in the gwern.net styling and so on...
[23:16:02] <gwern> rmmh: fuzz testing
[23:16:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: (Which would of course then allow popup recursion from within)
[23:17:11] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I think the problem there is the citations might not be linked right. all of the cites in this example are broken
[23:17:45] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I don't even see a bibliography at the end...
[23:18:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Well, strike the recursion then, but the localized styling is still a win
[23:18:38] * gwern looks at the html source. he's not sure about that
[23:18:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Plus it means saving the user from having to load their CSS and other assets)
[23:18:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[23:19:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> What *is* with these links, anyway
[23:19:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> They seem to point to perfectly ordinary URLs but when I Command-click, nothing happens...

[23:22:48] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yes, so what I was thinking was something like the annotation writing function could rewrite arxiv.org/abs/$ID.* links to either ar5iv.org/html/$ID\1 or arxiv.org/pdf/$ID\1. the ar5iv probably won't work with live popups for the same reason that arxiv.org doesn't, while the PDFs would get local-archive'd and be popuppable; but on the other hand, even janky HTML5 is probably...

[23:24:01] <gwern> yeah. I assume since they work so closely with arxiv and since so many sites set it, they probably will
[23:24:16] <gwern> either because they copy the arxiv config or just because for the usual reasons that so many set it
[23:26:26] <gwern> one option would be to do *both*. something like '<a href="a5iv">Title Foo Bar</a> [<a class="link-archive" href="/docs/www/arxiv.org/$HASH.pdf">PDF</a>]'

[23:29:30] <gwern> (people on popup-less websites legitimately complain about links to PDFs)
[23:29:46] <kuudes> sweet sweet tracking revenues
[23:31:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Well, on the other hand, do they complain about PDF links or *unmarked* PDF links? Ours surely aren't unmarked ... or they wouldn't be, if not for your weird linkicon philosophy :p
[23:31:44] <gwern> I think they complain about marked PDF links too, because it doesn't change that people don't want to read PDFs and on mobile PDFs can work really badly, not even opening in your browser
[23:31:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok sure yeah that is true
[23:31:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> But you know what
[23:32:07] <gwern> I'm always perplexed when I try to read a PDF on my smartphone and android needs to open it up in... google docs or something???
[23:32:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> We *could* provide PDF links on desktop and HTML on mobile
[23:32:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But I agree that we shouldn't, because HTML is better in either case)
[23:32:49] <gwern> the more I think about it, the more providing both links sounds like the best option. if I switched to PDF links, it'd trigger an [ORIGINAL] anyway
[23:33:08] <gwern> (or [ARCHIVE] or whatever it actually is, haven't looked in a while)
[23:33:35] <gwern> then non-PDF users will flinch away from the pdf icon and click on the alternative, which will happen to be HTML

[23:42:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmmm
[23:42:40] <gwern> he is the shame and laughingstock of his money-laundering countrymen
[23:42:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh but speaking of Russian Jews
[23:43:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems that our most prominent local Russian-American politician has announced that he's switching parties from D to R
[23:43:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> I hear through the grapevine that this guy is well-known as a political-wind-anticipator
[23:44:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know exactly what this all means but... it seems like it's gotta be something
[23:44:19] <gwern> bold move. I wonder if he's expecting a SJW crackup from the asians defecting in a once-in-generations realignment

[23:46:05] <Robomot> Brooklyn Democrat Brook-Krasny switches to GOP as he eyes Assembly run (Fed up with the Democratic party's "progressive" wing, a former conservative Democratic Brooklyn lawmaker switched his party registration to Republican.)
[23:46:15] <gwern> becoming bloomberg junior with asian backing? I could see that
[23:46:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The first Russian-speaking member of the Assembly ‚Äî who beat charges in 2019 of helping a crooked doctor run a $6.3 million pill mill" ... lol, I remember that

[23:50:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "He predicted other moderate and conservative Democrat pols in southern Brooklyn will soon follow his lead." ... (this is the part of Brooklyn where all the Asians live, obviously)
[23:50:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "And in southern Brooklyn, Republican Inna Vernikov trounced Democrat Steven Saperstein by 30 percentage points in the 48th District as the GOP picked up seats in the City Council.
[23:50:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like Brook-Krasny, Councilwoman Vernikov was also once a Democrat." ... huh, I didn't even realize this was already a trend
[23:51:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> ‚ÄúI was a registered Democrat for a brief time because I believed that in order to impact outcomes of elections in NYC, you had to be a Democrat,‚Äù Vernikov said in a text message.
[23:51:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> ‚ÄúHowever,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúseeing what the Democratic Party has done to our country and our city ‚Äî the policies resulting in out of control crime, homelessness, a declining economy, and a shift towards socialism, I could no longer remain a Democrat even on paper.
[23:51:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> ‚ÄúIt is not surprising to see individuals waking up and switching party affiliations. We need more Republicans in office.‚Äù ... real talk from real politicians, amirite
[23:51:22] <gwern> I wonder what the motivation for outright switching is. primary problems?

[23:58:51] <gwern> they do all sorts of one-offs and custom jobs. that's why they exist, not to stamp out a million instances
