[00:15:40] <evangeline> Alipha, Let's say that the compiler reorders it into  `m_InitCounter = 0; m_data = d;`, would this fail, because m_data hasn't yet been assigned by T1 and T2 will go into the else clause doing "d = m_data;", which will be empty at that time?

[00:17:01] <evangeline> Alipha, thanks
[00:17:12] <Alipha> The "may" here isn't very definite :-/ "In addition, accesses to atomic objects may establish inter-thread synchronization and order non-atomic memory accesses as specified by std::memory_order." https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic
[00:18:59] <evangeline> By inter-thread synchronization it's meant the reordering as you said: `m_InitCounter = 0; m_data = d;` ?
[00:20:42] <Alipha> oh, clicking on the std::memory_order link provides some clarification and confirmation that the compiler won't/can't reorder those assignments: "std::memory_order specifies how memory accesses, including regular, non-atomic memory accesses, are to be ordered around an atomic operation. ... The default behavior of all atomic operations in the library provides for sequentially consistent ordering."
[00:20:48] <Hello71> std::atomic should be considered an advanced technique. a first implementation should normally use mutexes, then profiled, then possibly replaced with atomics if appropriate

[00:30:37] <Hello71> also this seems weirdly constrained to exactly two threads? like, if ProcessData is called more than twice, it will re-increment and re-initialize the data

[03:44:22] <PJBoy> integer promotion
[03:44:54] <quartz> PJBoy: What do you mean?
[03:45:19] <quartz> What is wrong with it
[03:45:43] <kalven> implicit conversions are annoying
[03:45:48] <PJBoy> C++ has integer promotion, whereby any integer value of type with size smaller than int or unsigned is promoted to int or unsigned (depending on implementation)
[03:46:25] <PJBoy> it usually lands up as unsigned values being promoted to int
[03:46:32] <PJBoy> changing the signedness

[03:48:00] <zz> worse than int promotion is int demotion. e.g. void f(int) {} f(0L);
[03:49:00] <ssbr> quartz: I've been on a kick with clang::trivial_abi lately. It would've been nice if C++ made unique_ptr have the same performance as equivalent code using raw pointers, in all cases. Can still do that with language extensions / unstable ABI stuff in libc++, or with a Sufficiently Smart Compiler, so it's mostly good though.

[03:49:31] <quartz> PJBoy: So why did they implement integer promotion in the first place?
[03:49:45] <PJBoy> well C has it
[03:49:48] <zz> likely because explicitly typing it is annoying
[03:50:10] <zz> f(static_cast<unsigned long long>(0))? Nah thanks I'll stick with f(0) and have it promote.
[03:50:13] <PJBoy> and C has it because it had bitwidth of registers in mind as its main computational model for integer operations
[03:50:20] <quartz> So you basically can't do any operation with small types in C/C++? Because it will convert it to unsigned int?
[03:50:25] <PJBoy> zz's talking about implicit conversion
[03:50:35] <PJBoy> integer promotion is basically useless for everyone
[03:50:40] <PJBoy> and causes problems for some
[03:51:07] <PJBoy> yeah the result of any binary operation on integers results in int or unsigned or larger
[03:51:12] *** Quits: varioust (~varioust@gateway/tor-sasl/varioust) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[03:51:17] <PJBoy> and you have to cast back to the smaller size if need be

[03:51:30] <geordi> prvalue int
[03:51:57] *** CalamityToo is now known as CalamityBlue
[03:52:17] <Alipha> we could have still had implicit conversions without integer promotion. that is, (char)1 + (char)1 could have been defined to result in a char
[03:53:13] <quartz> PJBoy: SO it's a problem when you are performing some arithemetic operation on two smaller ints and want to preserve the "signedness"?
[03:53:21] <PJBoy> yeah
[03:53:35] *** Joins: phrosty (~phrosty@c-73-225-175-19.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[03:53:42] <zz> well, going with the small type isn't necessarily always efficient. atomic<bool> for example on riscv64 needs library support.
[03:54:44] <quartz> But I don't see how they could have changed this when teh language was being developed.
[03:54:58] <PJBoy> << (x << 31); unsigned char x = 1;
[03:54:58] <geordi> -2147483648
[03:55:02] <PJBoy> you got that for example
[03:55:04] <PJBoy> which is trash
[03:55:24] <PJBoy> << (x << 31); unsigned x = 1; // expected result
[03:55:25] <geordi> 2147483648
[03:55:37] <quartz> Ahh
[03:55:50] <PJBoy> and if you're using uintN_t, then whether you get signed or unsigned result is unknown to you
[03:55:52] <PJBoy> unless you check
[03:56:00] <Alipha> what's the type of `(uint32_t)3 + 5`?
[03:56:41] <Alipha> (it's either uint32_t or int, depending upon if int is larger than uint32_t or not)
[03:56:47] <zz> well, in all fairness,  (uint32_t)x + y, provided x+y does not overflow, gives you a type that can hold the result.
[03:57:11] <zz> feels like a tautology me saying that tho
[03:57:34] <Alipha> `(uint32_t)3 + INT_MAX` is either undefined behavior or well-defined :-)
[03:57:40] <PJBoy> I don't like how braces initialisation considers initializer_list overloads
[03:58:29] <PJBoy> I guess I wouldn't mind if braces init *only* did initializer_list
[03:58:45] <PJBoy> I dislike how const ref can bind to temporaries
[03:59:07] <PJBoy> I dislike forwarding references
[04:00:17] <PJBoy> I dislike how if consteval has mandatory braces
[04:00:21] <PJBoy> same with try and catch
[04:00:29] <zz> ssbr: unique_ptr does not specify performance, so it's a non-issue. Use a smart enough compiler.
[04:02:30] <PJBoy> I dislike how destructors in base classes with virtual methods are simultaneously non-virtual and public by default >_>
[04:03:25] <Alipha> i once heard that if Stroustrup had known about Java-like generics, then c++ would have had generics instead of templates :-)
[04:04:21] <ssbr> zz: The unfortunate thing is that the language does mandate observable behavior that is hard to optimize, so no compilers are smart enough. I remember reading e.g. http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p1863r1.pdf which touched on this.

[22:20:17] <anyone> auto buf = new char[sizeof(yourtype)]; new(buf) yourtype(); // now I placed your type on the heap ANYWAY
[22:20:36] <cbreak> std::vector doesn't use new

[22:21:43] <GyrosGeier> like, if you want to hold the lock beyond the current scope, then you call .lock() manually, instead of "new scoped_lock(&mutex);"
[22:22:20] <cbreak> if you call new directly, you should closely look at your code anyway
