[02:12:49] <erisco> hi
[02:13:36] <geekosaur> o/
[02:16:54] <erisco> say A and B are normal distributions, is there a definition for k*x? the intuition being that P(z), for example, is the probability that reals x, y chosen from A, B are such that x*y=z
[02:17:07] <erisco> is there a definition for A*B (is what I meant to ask)
[02:19:45] <Tuplanolla> Yes, erisco. It's called the product distribution and finding it requires evaluating an integral.
[02:21:03] <erisco> ah ha thanks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_the_product_of_two_random_variables
[02:22:38] <Tuplanolla> You can also transform any distribution with an arbitrary function that has a differentiable inverse. It amounts to performing a change of variables.
[02:23:42] <hpc> that wikipedia page's title is 8 words
[02:23:56] <hpc> i wonder how close that is to the longest title by word count
[02:24:00] <erisco> I have a lot to refresh and catch up on since my uni stats class

[02:24:38] <erisco> but going out on a limb here... I thought it would be interesting to investigate the following...
[02:26:20] *** Quits: __monty__ (~toonn@user/toonn) (Quit: leaving)
[02:27:12] <erisco> lets say you have some (x,y) pairs (1,3), (2,5), (4,9)  and you want to fit  y = m*x + b  to these points for some m, b
[02:28:09] <erisco> any particular value, like 1 or 3, can be represented as a probability distribution which is 1 at that value and zero everywhere else (guessing that is not normal though)
[02:29:04] <erisco> if you take a guess at m and b then you can (presumably) compute the distribution of y for a given x
[02:29:34] <erisco> and I'd just be interested to see what it looks like as you try to manipulate the distributions m and b to better fit the (x,y) pairs
[02:30:34] <Tuplanolla> Not quite. Probability density functions have to sum up to unity, so your distribution of choice would have to be infinite at the given point.
[02:30:37] <erisco> by translating and multiplying... is there some sequence of steps you can take to converge on  y = 2*x + 1
[02:30:58] <Tuplanolla> That is how the Dirac delta distribution is defined.
[02:31:26] <erisco> Tuplanolla, sum up to unity is sum to 1, right?
[02:31:54] <Tuplanolla> Yes. That distribution is quite annoying on its own, but integrates really nicely.
[02:31:57] *** Quits: little_mac (~little_ma@2601:410:4300:3ce0:d001:2aa2:4908:56e6) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:32:11] <erisco> which distribution would need to be infinite at a point?
[02:32:47] <Tuplanolla> The one you suggested for representing a single possible value.
[02:32:55] <erisco> oh because we're not discrete here, yeah, sorry
[02:33:12] <erisco> guess I got a bit muddled because I was originally thinking in integers but I guess that is a substantial difference
[02:33:40] <erisco> okay well thanks for the workaround :)

[02:36:19] <erisco> the intuition for this sort of investigation goes a way back but the previous step was thinking that I need a useful meaning to incomplete programs, one that can be refined... probability distributions seemed like an idea
[02:36:22] <monochrom> I say that the Dirac probability distribution/measure is a refreshing desert of determinism in the oasis of stochasticism >:)

[02:47:19] <erisco> I didn't really like numbers until I learned abstract algebra... give me a ring or something and I'm happier
[02:47:46] <erisco> mainly because it defines the bounds of the arena I get to play it, it isn't just a grab bag of notations and implicit axioms I find in books and the Internet
[02:48:06] <erisco> what is the perspective that would please my sensibilities for integrals / derivatives?

[02:53:01] <Tuplanolla> Synthetic differential geometry, perhaps.
[02:53:15] <Tuplanolla> It's less about how ass real numbers are.
[03:00:12] <erisco> maybe discrete is the way to go :P

[03:06:05] <hpc> just stick to complex numbers
[03:06:12] <hpc> that's what the universe does :P
[03:06:41] <geekosaur> and infinitesimals
[03:06:51] <erisco> not those
[03:07:13] <erisco> weren't the reals troublesome enough before you added infinitesimals?
[03:07:41] <monochrom> Who knows, perhaps infinitestimals solve those problems!
[03:08:04] <hpc> ah true, transfinite numbers aren't half bad
[03:08:36] <hpc> (but perhaps the limit of badness approaches 0.5?)
[03:09:00] <monochrom> Right? If your Windows computer is slowed down by having too many programs installed, install one more program, Norton Cleanup, to clean up and make it fast again!
[03:09:17] <erisco> does hyperfinite start at 5x finite?
[03:10:24] <monochrom> hpc, badness of transfinite numbers can be as high as inaccessible ordinals.  Note that inaccessible badness means no badness!
[03:10:50] <hpc> there's a joke from forever ago about making a cpu that runs lambda calculus natively
[03:10:57] <hpc> and it can compute infinitely fast because eta reduction is a noop
[03:11:55] <erisco> are you going to tell me that eta reduction is sufficient for general computation?
[03:12:21] <geekosaur> guess that's what makes it a joke
[03:12:56] <monochrom> That sounds like analogous to one of those C++ feats you can pull off to claim "O(1)-time prime factorization". (Hint: The compile time is huge, the O(1) refers to run time.)
[03:13:16] * geekosaur recalls someone at CMU SCS doing that one

[03:13:25] <hpc> one of my professors solved P=NP with an algorithm of "wait until $1000 of computer can solve the problem in an hour, then buy that computer"
[03:13:41] <hpc> thanks to moore's law that happens in O(n) time
[03:13:48] <monochrom> So, eta reduction is a noop at run time, but the compile time of a program that requests infinitely many eta reductions is not going to go well...
[03:14:07] <erisco> hpc, kind of brilliant
[03:15:16] <hpc> it has the same air to it as using the holographic principle to put a lower bound on asymptotic complexity of all algorithms
[03:15:17] <erisco> aren't we seeing the death of Moore's law though? are we going to start computing on individual atoms next?
[03:16:09] <hpc> because you can only fit so much information in a volume, and then the speed of light limits access to that information
[03:16:47] <erisco> I'm pretty much a YouTube expert on that and I think it only applies to certain kinds of universes... and ours is not one of them
[03:17:01] <hpc> haha, "youtube expert"
[03:17:02] * monochrom prefers Mealy's law.  Noise on online social platforms doubles every 18 months. >:)
[03:17:29] <hpc> here's another good one - not only is it possible to make a container that's bigger on the inside, but it's trivially easy
[03:17:32] <hpc> just put something inside the box
[03:17:36] <hpc> mass bends spacetime
[03:17:47] <erisco> I just watch a lot of Sabine Hossenfelder on YouTube so I can remember there is more to life than my job of making the next web app
[03:18:23] <hpc> erisco: there's also watching the next youtube video :P
[03:18:55] <erisco> hear hear
[03:18:56] <monochrom> Yeah anti-de-Sitter space (for which the holographic principle was proved) vs de-Sitter space (ours).  But it is conjectured that the holographic principle still works for us.
[03:19:13] <monochrom> OTOH the black hole argument is pretty convincing.
[03:20:01] <hpc> you have it backwards, we live in ads
[03:20:42] <hpc> ads is the one that expands infinitely, de-sitter space has a big crunch
[03:20:51] <erisco> negative cosmological constant
[03:22:01] <geekosaur> I thought de Sitter space was everywhere 0, anti-de Sitter space was everywhere infinite?
[03:22:32] <monochrom> And ads negative curvature, ours seemingly zero or positive.
[03:24:02] <hpc> oh, i have it backwards
[03:25:23] <hpc> but yeah, black holes are a pretty obvious limit of information density too :D

[19:01:31] <tomsmeding> Athas: I can't seem to connect to sigkill.dk and futhark-lang.org over IPv6, even though they have an AAAA record, and I can seem to connect to other servers over IPv6 fine
[19:01:54] <tomsmeding> IPv4 works fine; testcases are 'curl -v -4 sigkill.dk' and 'curl -v -6 sigkill.dk'

[20:47:18] <monochrom> I once made a homework question googlable but one would google the wrong thing, but still related, so googling would be super confusing.
[20:47:38] <monochrom> The homework was just a simple version of the probability monad.
[20:47:55] <monochrom> My ingenuity was naming it "the random monad".
[20:48:27] <monochrom> A student did ask "is it OK to import Control.Monad.Random?"  Success!
