[15:23:11] <hodapp> I don't see how the weight of a single sample would affect the neural net's behavior in inference
[15:23:44] <hodapp> in a minibatch for SGD, one could handle it by scaling the gradients up or down, but that's done almost solely in the optimizer
[15:23:58] <hodapp> but what would a neural net itself do with the weight of a single sample?

[16:04:02] <clime> hodapp: idk, i am not exactly sure i would say there might be ways for neural net to learn interpretting an input as if it was a weight? Or is it impossible through the math that neural network does? I am not sure
[16:11:01] <clime> maybe i am not being precise enough, i have some vector on input, and each of the elements ("sub-vectors") have a number in them that could be maybe interpretted as a weight in the sense that "this element is not so important for determining result"). So I wonder if neural net can learn such a thing that some parts of input are more imporant then other based on that single number
[16:11:51] <clime> i guess weights on the level of optimizer are unrelated to this
[16:14:25] <clime> i should probably try to do more thinking myself before writing here...

[21:14:39] <amazoniantoad> Hey I'm trying to use tensorflow to predict a value that I have normalized. I think there might be something wrong with my network design. I have it listed out here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70930395/im-trying-to-predict-on-a-range-of-values-which-i-normalized-using-tensorflow
[21:14:40] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  python - I'm trying to predict on a range of values which I normalized using tensorflow. I get NaN as my loss. What do I do? - Stack Overflow
[21:20:50] <mefistofeles> amazoniantoad: you might want to try #python
[21:20:52] <mefistofeles> just jk xD
[21:21:11] <amazoniantoad> mefistofeles: lmao
[21:21:26] <mefistofeles> hope you get help here, I think it's out of my expertise, but there should be someone here with more tf experience
[21:21:32] <amazoniantoad> thanks

[21:39:24] <Jong> mefistofeles, you had asked: "'neural nets are just weighted sums of weighted sums' is a bit of an oversimplification, isn't it?".  It's an oversimplification but my main point is that neural networks have always been attention based.  "Attention is all you need" just multiplies instead of adds. Instead of a_1*w_1 + a2*w2, it does  a_1*w_1 * a2*w2

[21:50:53] <dostoyevsky2> amazoniantoad: If it's just a simple csv, maybe start with sklearn?  Much easier than tf
[21:51:19] <clime> amazoniantoad: i usually get nans if i have have nans/infs/-infs on input. Maybe check for that first...

[22:25:12] <hodapp> Jong: they have a pretty big difference: a conventional FC neural net cannot vary this attention based on a given input, as the weights are fixed
[22:25:58] <hodapp> whereas in scaled dot-product attention, this is explicitly designed to vary based on the input
[22:26:01] <Jong> I'm not disputing that
[22:29:23] <Jong> I'm just disputing the implied idea (in the paper) that neural nets were not attention-based all along.
[22:31:29] <hodapp> if there is no mechanism for directing the attention, it's a rather degenerate form thereof
[22:32:45] <Jong> hodapp and actually, the attention can be varied via the traditional sequence of weighted sums and activation functions.   It's just much less efficient to do it that way.

[22:36:38] <Jong> Suppose we had Relu(a_1*w_1 + a_2*w1).   a_2*w_2 could vary the attention given to a_1*w_1  by reducing the amount of attention given to it by causing the output to be 0.  If a_2*w_2 were 3, and a_1*w_1 were -3 or less, then that turns off that neuron, giving it no attention

[22:41:28] <Jong> hodapp   I agree in what you're saying. But do you not agree that neural networks have always been attention-based?  Isn't the weighted sum an attention technique? Don't the weights dictate how much attention to give?
[22:43:37] <hodapp> no more than the entirety of linear programming and linear algebra are based on "attention"
