[01:41:47] <shawwwn> it was paranoid groupthink. at the start, he gave no indication that there was going to be any problem

[01:42:12] <shawwwn> hindsight 20/21.

[01:43:03] <pompolic> lol big foss
[01:43:14] <Dyo> shawwwn: they were abandoned channels tho.
[01:43:23] <redlizard> Remember, if you could not predict a thing while other people did predict it successfully, odds are that doesn't mean they guessed right -- it means they picked up on information that you failed to interpret correctly.
[01:44:01] <shawwwn> except the odds in this case relied on someone in charge making the worst possible decision at every step
[01:44:13] <shawwwn> all he had to do was nothing
[01:44:28] <redlizard> Even so, from a rationality perspective, the thing you should do is update.
[01:45:00] <pompolic> Big Foss, Big Boss' open source cousin
[01:45:02] <bildramer> "someone in charge making the worst possible decision at every step" sounds like my usual prediction, yes
[01:45:08] <bildramer> I'd almost say it's a definition of "in charge"
[01:45:23] <Dyo> dilbert fan?
[01:45:23] <redlizard> If group A says "I see no reason to predict outcome X based on evidence so far" and group B says "I see good reason to predict outcome X based on evidence so far", and outcome X then happens, the thing to do is update in favor of the wisdom of group B.
[01:46:10] <pompolic> what no
[01:46:16] <saturn2> there were plenty of signs that there were going to be problems. granted, this is way worse than the problems i was expecting, but still
[01:46:21] <redlizard> Saying "group A got lucky" is a rationality error unless you have DAMN good reason to believe so.
[01:46:58] <bildramer> use your instinct for shady people. someone comes in, you think "that guy acts shady", you suspect (but cannot prove or give evidence for the fact that) he'll do something harmful to someone. then it happens. if any of this is surprising or you assign low probabilities, it's your math that's wrong, not the intuitions
[01:47:17] <redlizard> saturn2: I think almost nobody could have predicted just how fast and dramatic the problems were. But I quite agree that the overall trajectory was both predictable, and predicted.
[01:47:36] <bildramer> when it's someone like that in charge, it's all someones
[01:48:06] <bildramer> that kind of reasoning is why we have concepts like "sellout"
[01:48:13] <shawwwn> to be clear, setting up a libra #lesswrong was a prudent move. I didn't oppose that
[01:48:32] <shawwwn> silencing the old channel and forcing everyone to switch, way before there was any problem, was my issue
[01:48:55] <pompolic> i want to argue with "wisdom of group B", that sounds like "your posterior probability of group B being accourate should be higher" but i think what you want to update on is the object level thing
[01:49:02] <pompolic> accurate*
[01:49:54] <pompolic> although that's probably true too, but it's more interesting to find out what they know that you don't, i guess
[01:50:53] <redlizard> pompolic: To be more precise, then: you should update in the direction of group B being genuinely able to discern relevant evidence on this issue. (Which is what I meant-in-summary with "wisdom".)
[01:51:07] <pompolic> yeah maybe i'm just distracted by semantics
[01:51:17] <pompolic> i think i agree
[01:51:19] <redlizard> No, it's a good clarification to make.
[01:51:27] <pompolic> o7
[01:51:32] <bildramer> depends on whether you judge the group was coincidentally right or right because of some better idea/information they have. the group will argue on this, of course (as it's doing right now). I don't think there's a shortcut to personally judging this

[01:55:48] <redlizard> bildramer: Quite strong evidence, in this case, because observed events accurately matched a pretty narrow prediction. A narrower prediction than random guessing would ever get you. Which is strong evidence of actual understanding over luck.
[01:56:19] <shawwwn> heh, apparently there are still a few dozen people in the old #lesswrong channel
[01:56:43] <redlizard> Meaning the posterior should favor the wisdom of the predicting group, unless your prior in favor of unpredictability was VERY strong -- stronger than it had any right to be.
[01:56:52] <spxtr> gwern: don't link such gross stuff in here, please
[01:57:36] <gwern> sad to see such quantum-orthodoxy-policing. why don't you go back to fantasizing about your unobservable 'infinite multiverse' or magic 'collapses'
[01:57:39] <bildramer> redlizard: we also know people invent justifications and they sound quite compelling

[01:58:17] <shawwwn> yis
[01:58:32] <bildramer> so that prior maybe has some right to be strong
[02:00:13] <redlizard> bildramer: That sounds like a very general counterargument towards ever being able to predict anything.
[02:00:22] <shawwwn> pretty strange https://i.imgur.com/FbCafHm.png
[02:01:11] <bildramer> redlizard: I'm thinking of e.g. technical analysis. yeah, your super specific prediction worked out, or it's more likely you just lied to yourself about being able to see it before it happened, and then to me
[02:01:45] <redlizard> bildramer: But... people actually predicted problems *in advance*, *out loud*,.
[02:01:46] <bildramer> it is general, yes
[02:01:55] <bildramer> and yeah it shouldn't apply too much here

[03:18:51] <gwern> up until recently, GANs gave you much sharper samples, and it's hard to see the tradeoff like the mode-dropping
[03:18:52] <RiversHaveWings> Use LPIPS reconstruction loss and a patchwise discriminator
[03:19:23] <gwern> I dunno what that is, but nevertheless, whenever you saw VAE samples in 2019 or before, they always disappointed

[17:26:28] <Robomot> Gaming for peace: Virtual contact through cooperative video gaming increases children's intergroup tolerance in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict - ScienceDirect (The effects of virtual cooperative video games have not yet been explored within the setting of hostile intergroup contexts; nor have they been tested…)
[17:28:34] <two2thehead> "We find that relative to an intragroup contact control group, children who participated in the intergroup program showed reduced intergroup bias on both cognitive and emotional indicators, including reduced stereotypical views, negative emotions and discriminatory tendencies toward members of the other ethnic group, as well as increased willingness to engage in social contact with outgroup members. These effects were long lasting and preserved six 
[17:28:34] <two2thehead> months after termination of the program. The intervention's effectiveness was consistent across measures, gender, and ethnic groups. Thus, the program we developed offers a feasible, relatively cost-effective gaming intervention that can be applied even in areas characterized by severe ethnic tension and hostile conflict."
[17:29:13] <two2thehead> I'm reading the study now. It was done on Israeli Jewish and Israeli Palestinian (ie 'within' country citizens) children
[17:29:19] <two2thehead> But I'm hopeful
[17:32:49] <two2thehead> "... we decided to conduct such meetings only after the third virtual session and at the end of the program because past research has demonstrated that despite the utility of direct contact for intergroup tolerance, inter group meetings have the potential to increase the anxiety of the participants significantly, particularly in situations where there is an on going conflict and animosity between the two ethnic groups (Paoliniet al., 2010;Yablon & 
[17:32:49] <two2thehead> Katz, 2001). Thus, we first sought to establish a playful and cooperative atmosphere between members of the two groups, and only then to introduce them in a face-to-face meeting. As a result, the first face-to-face meeting was held during the fourth session.It was aimed to further familiarize the students with their playmate counterparts. The Jewish students hosted the Palestinian students at their school, prepared a small show for them, played 
[17:32:50] <two2thehead> social games with them, and gave them small gifts. The second face-to-face meeting was held at the Palestinian school, intended to celebrate the end of the project and announce winners in the competition. In this session, thePalestinians prepared a small show for their guests, played social games with them, and gave them small gifts. The students presented the finalMinecraft products, and winners were announced. Notably, both Palestinian and Jewish 
[17:32:55] <two2thehead> parents attended the last face-to face meeting"
[17:32:57] <two2thehead> hmm
[17:37:23] <two2thehead> "Despite the aforementioned limitations, the results of the current longitudinal investigation provide strong support for the efficacy of the“Play2Talk” program in creating a long-lasting reduction in inter group bias among Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Israeli elementary-school students. These kinds of cooperative computer-mediated video gaming interventions are especially important for children living in areas affected by violent and hig
[17:37:23] <two2thehead> hly hostile ethnic conflicts. Children living is such regions have very limited opportunities for direct positive contact with out group members, and they are consistently exposed to their societies' general negative out group attitudes. Thus, providing children in these hardship zones with an opportunity to reduce intergroup bias from the comfort of their computer is not only priceless but required to help avoid further escalation. Hopefully, 
[17:37:24] <two2thehead> future research will build on our promising initial results to refine and improve these kinds of interventions."
[17:37:45] <two2thehead> So basically another small positive indicator of how things could be made better

[18:56:35] <RiversHaveWings> Super good reconstructed reals, fakes are meaningless noise

[18:57:48] <RiversHaveWings> (i.e. i'm making the information bottleneck progressively smaller)
[18:58:00] <feep[work]> the fake noise is kinda implying that it's just basically smuggling pixels in the state
[18:58:25] <RiversHaveWings> feep[work]: for the current run, stage 1 is 64 dim, stage 2 is 4*4*4, stage 3 is 4*8*8, stage 4 is 4*16*16

[18:59:06] <RiversHaveWings> And yeah, with no KL Div loss
[18:59:12] <feep[work]> what's KL div loss?
[18:59:14] <RiversHaveWings> The fakes will just be sampled noise
[18:59:37] <RiversHaveWings> OK so for each stage the encoder outputs a tensor of means and a tensor of log variances
[19:00:02] <RiversHaveWings> The decoder takes each stage and samples from a Gaussian with that mean and log variance
[19:00:26] <feep[work]> kay
[19:00:50] <feep[work]> RiversHaveWings: wait why does the decoder sample at each stage?
[19:00:51] <RiversHaveWings> (Well it's more complicated than that, the encoder and decoder internal activations at every stage but the first get combined to make the means/log vars tensors)
[19:01:03] <RiversHaveWings> Information bottleneck
[19:01:13] <feep[work]> :confused noises:
[19:01:24] <RiversHaveWings> OK let's just consider a one-stage VAE
[19:01:38] <RiversHaveWings> Encoder outputs a tensor of means and log vars, you sample from them, and feed it to the decoder
[19:02:11] <RiversHaveWings> Now the KL Div loss constrains the means to be approx 0 and the variances approx 1
[19:02:44] <RiversHaveWings> (Specifically, you compute the KL divergence between a Gaussian with that mean and variance and a Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1)
[19:02:44] <feep[work]> um
[19:03:04] <RiversHaveWings> (For every distribution the encoder output, and take the mean)
[19:03:08] <feep[work]> does that result in something like ... every element should be equally meaningful?
[19:03:26] <RiversHaveWings> It means we can make fakes by sampling from Gaussian noise with mean 0 std 1 and feeding it to the decoder
[19:03:32] <feep[work]> I mean, yes
[19:03:58] <feep[work]> but like, why do you sample anything but the last layer
[19:04:00] <RiversHaveWings> Like, before KL div loss has kicked in, the log variances the encoder outputs are super low, it's making the information bottleneck as wide as it can
[19:04:15] <RiversHaveWings> And as a result the fakes are meaningless
[19:04:19] <feep[work]> you still haven't explained what the information bottleneck is
[19:04:23] <RiversHaveWings> And the reconstructed reals are super good

[19:05:27] <RiversHaveWings> It is (a) having to encode the image into a latent space (b) having noise added to the latent space
[19:06:18] <feep[work]> wait so ... if I'm imagining the landscape of states
[19:06:42] <feep[work]> what I'm seeing with that noisy image is like ... a landscape of state vectors where you have a bunch of widely-distributed islands of unique outputs
[19:07:04] <feep[work]> but every component of the generator that's contributing to each output basically only contributes to that one output
[19:07:09] <feep[work]> of the network*
[19:07:32] <feep[work]> so for n training samples, it falls into, to abuse the term, an n-mode collapse
[19:07:51] <feep[work]> I mean, that's what my intuition is saying for "network state that would produce that image"
[19:07:57] <feep[work]> islands of coherence in seas of noise
[19:08:03] <RiversHaveWings> With the noisy image, it's just a normal autoencoder still, so feeding Gaussian noise to the decoder produces garbage
[19:08:19] <feep[work]> right because most states are garbage
[19:08:24] <feep[work]> in the gaussian space, at least
[19:08:31] <feep[work]> or are you saying it's *just* a matter of distribution
[19:08:50] <feep[work]> ie. if you sampled, for each state variable, from a distribution that matches the training data *for that variable*, you'd get good images?
[19:09:12] <RiversHaveWings> The sampling step between the encoder and the decoder, where the encoder was constrained to output near mean 0 std 1, *makes* most Gaussian states good
[19:09:20] <feep[work]> right, I see why it would do that
[19:09:28] <RiversHaveWings> yes, the reconstructed reals are sampled too
[19:09:52] * feep[work] blinks
[19:09:57] <feep[work]> okay, so it's *just* a distribution issue
[19:09:58] <RiversHaveWings> I mean there is a sampling step in there, it samples from the means and log vars output by the encoder instead of mean 0 std 1
[19:10:08] <feep[work]> oh okay
[19:10:25] <feep[work]> oh, "super good reconstructed reals"
[19:10:26] <feep[work]> right
[19:10:35] <feep[work]> RiversHaveWings: uh, so why normalize it?
[19:10:52] <feep[work]> I mean, why not always sample in that distribution
[19:10:55] <RiversHaveWings> yes, because optimization drives the log vars the encoder outputs lower until there's essentially no sampling
[19:11:19] <feep[work]> oh, it's basically dampening?
[19:11:30] <RiversHaveWings> *Then* once it's learned that, we ramp the KL div loss weight up over time

[19:13:51] <feep[work]> d*
[19:13:58] <feep[work]> the right side
[19:14:05] <RiversHaveWings> we could take a real and encode it and sample repeatedly
[19:14:22] <RiversHaveWings> It would just make things that mostly looked like the real
[19:14:22] <feep[work]> no like, I mean, for every state var you *know* the distribution it had for the training data, right?
[19:14:39] <feep[work]> why not just like, store that info with the network
[19:15:07] <RiversHaveWings> you mean... do a normal autoencoder and then encode the entire training set once it's done training?
[19:15:15] <feep[work]> yeah basically
[19:15:25] <feep[work]> and then sample from that
[19:15:29] <RiversHaveWings> well, it'll stick information in the correlations between the state vars in complicated ways
[19:15:48] <feep[work]> ah right, so you want the vector as a whole to have a pleasing shape
[19:15:53] <feep[work]> gaussian hypersphere
[19:15:57] <RiversHaveWings> Treating the distributions of the state vars as uncorrelated and sampling still won't work well
[19:16:01] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : all games should have the ability to pin or center the cone-of-vision, that you see when you move the mouse in an FPS, to the center of the character body. That would probably decrease nausea an appreciable amount. You see an example of unpinned cone-of-vision when you sit in the backseat of a car and stare out the window.
[19:16:14] <RiversHaveWings> *But* if we inject uncorrelated Gaussian noise into the states before feeding them to the decoder
[19:16:24] <two2thehead> note cone-of-vision != field-of-vision
[19:16:34] <feep[work]> two2thehead: you would get complete confusion as to where you were going.
[19:16:35] <RiversHaveWings> *Then* we can sample from uncorrelated distributions and it'll have to work well!
[19:16:53] <RiversHaveWings> *Because* it had to learn to reconstruct even with this noise!
[19:17:07] <two2thehead> feep[work], let me give you an example of bad cone-of-vision
[19:17:09] <feep[work]> RiversHaveWings: so you're basically reserving space around the samples?
[19:17:30] <feep[work]> I mean, I feel that will be problematic because you kinda want the state variables to be continuous
[19:17:31] <RiversHaveWings> I... maybe
[19:17:35] <RiversHaveWings> Not really
[19:17:37] <feep[work]> it will look good but not interpolate well?
[19:17:42] <RiversHaveWings> You can interpolate in a VAE latent space I think?
[19:17:49] <dbohdan> pie__bnc: XPath can be better than CSS selectors for complex queries.  For example, yours translates to `//dt//strong/text()|//dt//a/@href`.  You can run XPath queries on HTML with `xmllint --html --xpath`.  https://devhints.io/xpath is a good reference.

[19:17:55] <feep[work]> right, but if you're randomizing around your training samples
[19:18:13] <feep[work]> you're kinda pushing them apart, when normally you want it to pick up commonalities?
[19:18:27] <RiversHaveWings> I could try interpolating but I think it should work

[22:02:42] <two2thehead> ggreer, re 45-min-internal-storage limit, could you upgrade it if you want?
[22:03:20] <two2thehead> I have a pet theory that once it (all car cameras) hits the 12hour mark, crime will be easier to solve, ceteris paribus
[22:03:38] <ggreer> I'm not sure. sentry mode auto-saves 10 minute clips around any significant motion. it's just that the last 45ish minutes are always in the car's buffer
[22:03:49] <two2thehead> hmm. ggreer +1
[22:04:30] <ggreer> the main issue is police. they usually don't do anything with the footage unless the crime is violent
[22:05:04] <ggreer> but if you could send the footage to facebook or google and have them match against their face databases, you'd solve a shitload of crimes
[22:05:14] <two2thehead> yep
[22:05:25] <adiabatty> I was gonna say, all that video does nothing if you live in boudinville
[22:05:26] <ggreer> (then it would just be a matter of getting the police to actually go catch the people)
[22:06:01] <two2thehead> not to mention the deterrence effect, similar to how Amazon ring cameras always 'catch' people trying to steal parcels, but change their mind, once they see the camera
[22:08:19] <ggreer> not sure how true that is. there are ring cameras on maybe 20% of the houses around here and we have flock cameras at the entrances and exits of the housing complex, but package theft is still pretty bad (not as bad as the bay area, but maybe 5% of packages get stolen)
[22:08:36] <ggreer> that said, the police here do bust package thieves
[22:09:47] <two2thehead> iirc youtube has videos of people 'moving' towards packages, but visibly and audibly saying things like 'Nope' once they spot the camera. I'll see if I can find examples

[22:35:59] <dbohdan2> ggreer: Is it a thing in America to have the package carrier call you on your cell to arrange a good delivery time?  That is the standard protocol in Eastern Europe.  They never just leave the package at your door.  In Ukraine, the state-run postal service want to knows your phone number, and private delivery companies usually do not accept packages without the recipient's phone.
[22:36:23] <adiabatty> dbohdan2: never heard of this service before
[22:36:48] <adiabatty> usually if it's a sensitive delivery they'll show up and not deliver if there's nobody home to accept
[22:36:59] <ggreer> depends on the shipping company and your relationship with them. people who send/receive lots of packages can usually get that sort of service
[22:37:05] <adiabatty> and leave a "we missed you; we'll try again tomorrow" note on the door
[22:37:14] <ggreer> but not for a typical thing you order off amazon

[23:18:19] <dbohdan2> rmmh: Huh, I'd read about people trimming wicks, but never made the connection.  In retrospect, of course the wick curling and burning away isn't a free default.
[23:19:05] <dbohdan2> I may have had to trim the wick of a kerosene lamp during the power outages of the late 1990s-early 2000s
[23:19:10] <rmmh> I suspect that's why wicks are woven together, and not a single strand
[23:19:16] <rmmh> they're woven with a curl 
[23:19:29] <dbohdan2> Right
[23:19:36] <rmmh> anyways, stealing all this from the latest Tech Connections video on lamp designs https://youtu.be/tURHTuKHBZs

[23:21:11] <dbohdan2> rmmh: That seems like the sort of thing I'd want to watch.  Thanks for the link.
[23:21:20] <rmmh> dbohdan2: but there's not enough oyxgen in the center of a flame at the wick's head to actually combust, so it just goes black
[23:21:25] <rmmh> kind of like charcoal!
[23:21:41] <Logos01> torrefaction.
[23:21:50] <Logos01> The process you are referring to is called torrefaction.
[23:22:07] <rmmh> probably pyrolysis
[23:22:49] <dbohdan2> Ordinary things are pretty crazy when you look at them closely
[23:23:16] <Logos01> rmmh: Nope. https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_major_difference_between_Pyrolysis_and_torrefaction_of_biomass_Which_method_is_more_efficient_and_productive
[23:23:28] <feepbot> What is the major difference between Pyrolysis and torrefaction of biomass? Which method is more efficient and productive? (Read 7 answers by scientists to the question asked by Arokia Hansel Rajan Arokia on Feb 20, 2018)
[23:23:45] <Logos01> Pyrolysis and torrefaction are similar but distinct.
[23:25:12] <Logos01> Most important distinction is that pyrolysis produces liquids and torrefaction does not.
[23:26:05] <Logos01> rmmh: Also, this leads to one of the most cumbersome terms I know of that is only really relevant because dishonest branding by sellers.
[23:26:24] <Logos01> "Torrefacted Lignocellulosics" vs "charcoal"
[23:26:34] <rmmh> torrefaction is a form of pyrolysis
[23:26:38] <Logos01> Because a lot of charcoals aren't actually a char.
[23:27:35] <Logos01> Powdered and pressed actual coal and declared charcoal briquettes.
[23:32:38] <galambo> wow daring fireball is so much better when I filter out posts that mention the words 'apple', 'iOS', 'mac' and 'sponsor'
[23:35:43] <rmmh> ...is there anything left?
[23:35:47] <Logos01> rmmh: Speaking of briquettes -- there was a very short period of time before the industrial production of 'smokeless' gunpowder where people figured out a drastically better way to use black powder.
[23:35:53] <pompolic> by induction, then, is it better if you filter out literally everything?
[23:36:17] <rmmh> mining?
[23:36:20] <Logos01> Literally you make it into briquettes shaped like hollow cylinders. That alone let you use up to 35% more black powder in the same gun.
[23:36:54] <Logos01> gunpowder/black-powder is 'surface' burning, so by shaping it from loose to briquettes causes the burn to take longer.
[23:37:07] <Logos01> Which reduces the "peak" pressure of the explosion but gives you a higher average total pressure.
[23:37:08] <rmmh> ah instead of having the spherical pellets with 67% packing efficiency?
[23:37:11] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: have you read the nagatoro comics?
[23:37:15] <gwern> no
[23:37:19] <Logos01> rmmh: It's not just about packing efficiency.
[23:37:28] <Logos01> It's about the surface area of the burn event.
[23:37:34] <PapuaHardyNet> well, it's rather tame. I think the anime went further and was more risque
[23:38:03] <Logos01> rmmh: So just doing that slowed down the explosion and kept higher pressure without all the powder asplodeyfying at once.
[23:38:11] <rmmh> neat!
[23:38:24] <PapuaHardyNet> nagatoro was very childlike in her portrayal. Her teases were amateurish, although delightful, and wouldn't have hurt a normal high school boy
[23:38:30] <Logos01> And thus you could use more powder without asploeyfying the gun barrel.
[23:38:41] <rmmh> lower peak pressures and higher pressure under a curve sounds good for velocity and barrel sizes
[23:38:44] <PapuaHardyNet> it's just wish fulfillment anyway
[23:38:48] <Logos01> This fact was discovered and used for like 5 years total before smokeless powder took over.
[23:38:53] <rmmh> you saw that .50 explosion, right?
[23:39:07] <Logos01> ... let's say no and you point to it.
[23:39:10] <galambo> haha, https://twitter.com/ggreer/status/1404610005576294405

[23:44:45] <galambo> gwern, ham radio sounds cool. I wonder if I could find interesting people closeby if I got into ham radio
[23:45:00] <gwern> I think they would be far away, that's kinda the point
