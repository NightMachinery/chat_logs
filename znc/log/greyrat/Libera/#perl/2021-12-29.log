[00:17:32] <pragma-> ryebreadtsunamip: the problem with that is that Perl has way too many ways to do the same things, so it's quite hard to agree on what's "good" or "modern" Perl. 
[00:20:15] <buu> It doesn't seem that hard

[00:21:40] <pragma-> Perl supports many paradigms. Different people and projects have different values. Some people write Perl to be fast and efficient. Others write Perl to be readable. Yet others write Perl to make it as unreadable as possible for whatever reason (golfing, mistaken belief that unreadable code is the hallmark of a hacker, etc). Some people hate object-oriented code, some people write nothing but
[00:21:40] <pragma-> object-oriented code. Perl supports it all so there are many, many camps.

[00:22:05] <pragma-> Some people just use Perl as a glue between projects. Others use write the entire project in Perl.
[00:23:23] <pragma-> Some people prefer strictly pure Perl. Others prefer to put most of their logic in C/XS.
[00:24:54] <pragma-> As for object-oriented Perl, there's a half a dozen popular OO libraries and methodologies...
[00:25:49] <pragma-> I'd like to play around with Object::Pad one of these days.

[03:56:47] <LeoNerd> I'd suggest using try/catch rather than eval

[16:57:26] <simcop2387> i need another two pay checks before i can buy any new toys.  i just spent way too much on a new monitor and KVM switch.
[16:59:08] <Mandevil> simcop2387: You just store the values without any data aggregation?
[16:59:41] <simcop2387> Mandevil: typically so.  at least in the immediate case, and then i'll aggregate them later.
[16:59:56] <simcop2387> half the time that's because i don't know how i want to aggregate them when i'm setting it all up
[17:00:23] <Mandevil> Hm, that doesn't sound very enticing.

[18:58:00] <simcop2387> leont: why isn't it production ready yet? :)
[18:58:15] <leont> Mainly because it hasn't been tested much
[18:58:37] <LeoNerd> It needs to prove itself in battle
[18:58:42] <LeoNerd> AKA more Klingon
[18:59:07] <simcop2387> 0.001 indications production readiness though :)
[18:59:14] <alh> Content security policy for threads. Woof
[18:59:23] <leont> I'm aware of some hairiness around channel notifications that I haven't entirely solved yet.
[18:59:25] <LeoNerd> A -different- CSP
[18:59:33] <simcop2387> alh: it's mostly waiting for the CORS for threads to be production ready i gather
[18:59:40] <alh> (I know, CSP just gives me bad feelings)
[18:59:46] <alh> simcop2387++
[18:59:48] <xenu> that api is a bit weird, i expected a coderef instead of module *and* a function name
[19:00:01] <LeoNerd> coderefs require cloning, which is a fork-alike operation
[19:00:10] <LeoNerd> module+function name is a cleanroom, spawnprocess-like operation
[19:00:22] <LeoNerd> This being -the entire point-
[19:00:30] <leont> Yeah, allowing coderefs there is an explosion of complications
[19:00:37] <leont> Even if I get why you want that
[19:00:39] <simcop2387> if only we had non-closing coderefs
[19:00:55] <LeoNerd> We do. It's called "giving the coderef a name" :)
[19:00:58] <xenu> it isn't possible to disregard the closed-over variables?
[19:01:03] <LeoNerd> It's too subtle
[19:01:15] <leont> coderefs implicitly capture over their package, including things like imported subroutines
[19:01:20] <LeoNerd> It's about a billion times easier to spin up a brand new interpreter, than try to un-share an existing cloned one
[19:01:27] <leont> It's much more complicated than one initially thinks
[19:02:18] <leont> Also, filehandles and globs currently crash when sent over a queue. I'm not sure I can fix this on my side though, it's fragility in core's cloning code that I may have to fix there.
[19:02:35] <leont> Er, filehandles and coderefs
[19:02:51] <xenu> still, having just function name would probably make more sense
[19:02:59] <xenu> it's weird that it loads a module
[19:03:11] <xenu> i suppose it's more convenient in some cases though
[19:03:19] <simcop2387> filehandles should be fixable on unix at least.  though that'll be annoying to do
[19:03:39] <simcop2387> coderefs sound nearly impossible

[19:21:08] <leont> xenu: That sounds dumb, but a lot of the windows specific threading code is unhelpful like that
[19:21:25] <xenu> i don't quite understand the purpose of those functions
[19:21:31] <xenu> it seems they're just defined to malloc
[19:21:33] <xenu> etc
[19:21:37] <simcop2387> merpaderp: capture tiny is a nice simple way to do it, not as flexible as IPC::Open and friends though.  IPC::Run and I think IPC::Cmd also
[19:22:28] <simcop2387> that said open with a pipe is also doable if you don't need to capture the output (usually that turns out to not be the case though)
[19:22:50] <merpaderp> at first you dont but then you realize errors are important as well
[19:23:37] <merpaderp> problem I have with IPC::Open3 is that I need to use Select, then check if either stdout/err said anything and it usually breaks somewhere because socket programming is hard
[19:24:18] <simcop2387> take a look at IPC::Run it can handle that for you, esp look at it's "pump" interface
[19:24:59] <simcop2387> you can also do all this with an event loop like IO::Async and its IO::Async::Process
[19:27:13] <leont> xenu: ithreads use thread-specific memory pools. If you tear down a thread, you tear down everything that's allocated by it. I suppse it helps against memory leaks, but it's not what we want in this particular case.
[19:27:27] <leont> The shared pool is the one pool that isn't thread-specific
[19:28:54] <xenu> i guess the simplest fix would to just use standard C memory allocation functions
[19:31:30] <leont> Not impossible, but will require some convincing: https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/blead/XSUB.h#L585

[19:33:29] <LeoNerd> I have one of those somewhere as well. F-AA I think
