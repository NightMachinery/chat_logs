[12:47:27] <konubinix> Hi. I would like to use the new citation engine of org 9.5 to replace the stuff that I hacked in the past with some org-ref
[12:47:56] <konubinix> But it looks like oc.el recognize only links in the form [cite:@something] and not cite:@something
[12:48:41] <konubinix> Do you know of some setup to use oc.el links as references of org roam notes ?
[12:50:08] <konubinix> I guess that it might have something to do with using https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref-cite now, but it is not yet in any elpa I know of
[12:50:28] <konubinix> May be it is too early to use it out of the box?
[12:52:12] <konubinix> But that would defeat the purpose of oc.el superseding org-ref, wouldn't it?
[12:52:47] <zaeph> We'll get to it eventually.
[12:52:53] <zaeph> Again, I'm mostly the bottleneck for most UX stuff.
[13:03:51] <konubinix> I'm not sure I understand correctly. You mean my reasoning is valid, or you mean that eventually you will provide something OOTB ?

[13:59:15] <konubinix> Actually, I don't mind not having something OOTB, as I can hack something new. But to do so, I need to understand what each package is meant for
[13:59:50] <konubinix> And there is very likely some overlap between oc.el org-ref, org-ref-cite, org-roam-bibtex
[14:00:50] <zaeph> I meant that it's probably within the scope of org-roam-bibtex, and that we're slow on the UX front for stuff that is either new in the org-roam model or in org-mode.
[14:13:04] <konubinix> Ok
[14:17:00] <zaeph> Sorry if that sounded a bit cryptic; starved for time right now.
[14:20:00] <konubinix> It does not
[14:20:31] <konubinix> Also, I hope you don't feel too under pressure
[14:21:24] <konubinix> After all, this is all open source software and, unless I'm mistaken, you did not commit to anything
[14:21:51] <konubinix> Just trying to reassure you about the expectations we (or at least I) may have
[14:22:52] <zaeph> No, don't worry, it's not pressure; it's mostly that I'm trying to organise my life on the side of FLOSS so that I can spend quality time working on it, and it pains me a little to see how little is being done on org-roam's UX since v2, especially in areas where I'm good at.
[14:23:27] <konubinix> I understand
