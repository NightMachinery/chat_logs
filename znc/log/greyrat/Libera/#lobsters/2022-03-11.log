[14:02:12] <river> lol ukraine news masquerading as programming content
[14:04:15] <gerikson> borderline offtopic...
[14:05:30] <river> ask yourself this. what's better. IEEE754 or IEEE754 with one random change that you don't expect or remember that somehow differentiates it from all other languages
[14:05:52] <river> principle of least surprise would suggest IEEE754 warts and all is better
[14:06:36] <iDrougge> That's why we can never have nice things.
[14:07:02] <river> well maybe we can have nice things. what would be nice?
[14:07:26] <iDrougge> Joke aside, JS's adherence to IEEE754 has generated a million times more confusion than non-adherence.
[14:08:08] <river> what is an example of that?
[14:08:55] <iDrougge> Basic arithemetic doesn't behave like non-programmers intuitiviely understand arithmetic.
[14:09:16] <iDrougge> There is no reason to adhere to hardware representations in a language like JS, the real reason being that it made it possible to "design" and implement in ten days.

[14:10:26] <river> what would be a different way to implement numbers?
[14:11:27] <iDrougge> Arbitrary precision decimal.
[14:15:45] <iDrougge> JS has only one numeric type, so you must choose one which doesn't have arbitrary limitations and that serves the intended purpose of JS, which is not weather simulations.
[14:17:38] <river> I think that arbitrary precision decimal also has an arbitrary limitat
[14:18:03] <river> i guess you can set it to any value (that fits in a 64 bit word?)
[14:18:13] <rbasak> I've always considered it a flaw that languages point you towards floating point whenever you need to store a value that could be fractional.
[14:19:08] <river> in scheme we have rationals as a built in type
[14:19:12] <rbasak> I consider it an accident of history because a big early use of computers was for other engineering type purposes, so having built-in FPUs made sense, so they became an integrated part of languages but fixed point and similar systems did not.
[14:19:41] <river> (and the integers involved are arbitrary precision)
[14:19:55] <iDrougge> rbasak: Yes.
[14:19:57] <rbasak> (since they didn't need hardware support, early/primitive languages did not need to have integrated support either)
[14:20:12] <iDrougge> river: You don't have to store a number in a machine word.
[14:20:48] <river> there's a key difference between arb. prec. integers and decimals
[14:21:04] <iDrougge> rbasak: I don't know; FPUs for mainstream purposes seem to be a late invention.
[14:21:07] <river> integers can grow as they added to, multiplied etc.
[14:21:25] <river> decimals cannot, as they are actually fixed to e.g. 1000 decimal places
[14:21:31] <river> otherwise calculating 1/3 would never terminate
[14:21:45] <river> this number, 1000, is stored in a machine word
[14:21:55] <iDrougge> Good point, but ideally the precision should be configurable.
[14:22:12] <river> yeah

[19:00:24] <rb> hmm i wonder whether valve could set steamOS up to be the "stable linux ABI" and then entice developers to switch their games away from proton
[19:00:33] <rb> the steam runtime was fine for this but it also didn't work great
[19:05:28] <cb> i mean the last few times they tried that devs managed to scribble outside the lines and accidentally depend on libs that they shouldn't have

[19:25:34] <river> i dont know it
[19:25:51] <river> > plocate works by creating an inverted index over trigrams (combinations of three bytes) in the search strings, which allows it to rapidly narrow down the set of candidates to a very small list

[19:36:09] <mocx> ws Nice to see an official “we’re not supporting this” page from them
[19:36:32] <ws> I find it personally better that it comes with SteamOS by default
[19:36:50] <ws> but if you want Windows, they're not restricting you to and are actively working on making it work on the Steam Deck
[19:37:20] <ws> which is good enough if that's your goal
[19:37:34] <ws> instead of, say, leaving you at luck having to use community-made drivers etc.
[19:38:02] <rb> they will support dualboot but they won't support windows itself
