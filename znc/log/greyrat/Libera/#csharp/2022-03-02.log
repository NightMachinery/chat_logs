[00:05:10] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: yeah, and "bad russia. bad bad russia"
[00:06:30] <Slade> Suchiman: I'm not super up on current events, but if I understand correctly, the entire western world seems to want Germany to 1) Build a huge army  2) march through poland  3) fight russians...    am I up to speed?
[00:06:49] <JakeSays> weird. between each speaker two guys go to the podium. one touches everything and then the other one wipes everything
[00:07:19] <JakeSays> Slade: no, they just want Suchiman to do it
[00:07:21] <xb0o2> It's for good luck.
[00:07:25] <JakeSays> xb0o2: lol
[00:08:13] <Suchiman> Slade: well everyone wanted to increase our military spending to match NATO spending recommendations :P
[00:08:29] <Suchiman> Slade: haven't heard about marching through poland though, that might wake bad memories
[00:08:37] <JakeSays> indeed
[00:08:53] <Suchiman> but yeah they wanna invest 100 billion € into the army
[00:08:55] <JakeSays> things didn't end well last time germany took a stroll

[00:11:17] <Slade> Suchiman: oh yea, im aware of that. I just found myself reading about germany attacking russia, and felt the need to break it down step by step :P
[00:11:38] <Suchiman> JakeSays: everyone said we're supplying ukranian with 1000 RPG's and stuff... which is only correct on a technicality, we've permitted the netherlands to supply ukrania with german made RPG's
[00:11:52] <JakeSays> Suchiman: right
[00:12:38] <Slade> Suchiman: huh, and apparently poland told yall to do it..  "Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland, who traveled to Berlin to personally “shake Germany’s conscience” on how to respond to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. “Today there is no time for selfishness,” Mr. Morawiecki said, in announcing his visit on Twitter."
[00:12:43] <JakeSays> Suchiman: so germany and the netherregions are doing it

[02:34:10] <Nasp> Sure

[02:43:18] <megaTherion> russian government made it clear that the people in ukraine will be killed because they are ukrainians and that they dont want the ideology of russians

[02:49:20] <megaTherion> BtbN: its a big myth that if someone uses nukes the whole planet will be done for, it depends who nukes what and how it will happen... I agree we shouldnt go into this but I think that NATO would be faster and more precise nuking :)(

[02:50:19] <Nasp> Lasers aren't that useful yet
[02:50:21] <megaTherion> Nasp: the big issue now is that there is no way out of this war.... russia would need to surrender I think
[02:50:47] <pandem> actually the white house had a playbook that if russia nukes ukraine they dont nuke back
[02:50:48] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: i'm pretty sure that most if not all of russia's icbm's would be shot down before detonation
[02:50:50] <Nasp> megaTherion:  They can withdraw, but Putin would lose face
[02:50:52] <Nasp> And i dont think he wants that
[02:51:00] <Nasp> I think the best we can hope for is an Russian uprising
[02:51:04] <megaTherion> Nasp: yes... he will lose face one way or another - putin is done for basically
[02:51:07] <Nasp> Or some general or other from within executes him

[02:51:27] <MatthiasVance> JakeSays: Would you say the same if the US would fire the nukes?
[02:51:34] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: no
[02:51:36] <eurogos> would that mean shot down in the "no nuke" kind of way
[02:51:39] <MatthiasVance> Oh, hm
[02:51:39] <megaTherion> Nasp: basically you need more than just putin to do it, but NATO wont hesitate to nuke russia into oblivion I think
[02:51:45] <Nasp> JakeSays:  What makes you think all would be shot down?
[02:51:49] <megaTherion> Nasp: I can only hope for russian people getting rid of this moron ASAP
[02:51:51] <Nasp> Don't they have these super fast super sonic nukles
[02:51:59] <Nasp> Remember flight time is like in minutes

[02:52:23] <Nasp> megaTherion: Nope
[02:52:24] <JakeSays> Nasp: we have super faster anti-nuke missiles
[02:52:31] <Nasp> Their nukes should be superior
[02:52:32] <megaTherion> thats why they want belrus to establish nuclear weapons
[02:52:33] <Nasp> Not sure if all of them are
[02:52:35] <eurogos> JakeSays, but do we though?
[02:52:39] <JakeSays> eurogos: yes

[02:53:03] <Nasp> megaTherion:  Why?
[02:53:08] <Nasp> USA will just fire back
[02:53:09] <megaTherion> because thats Putins plan since 2008?
[02:53:34] <JakeSays> you need to remember that russia's military (especially nukes) is generations older than ours
[02:53:41] <megaTherion> they simply dont have that range, thats also why they are so upset with nato being in their range
[02:53:47] <megaTherion> JakeSays: exacly
[02:53:55] *** Quits: k8yun (~k8yun@user/k8yun) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[02:54:00] <pandem> i dont think shooting down nukes is that easy
[02:54:05] <megaTherion> its old and russia doesnt have the money, its always bad with economy since decades
[02:54:19] <JakeSays> pandem: it's not
[02:54:26] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Probably the vast majority, but some of them are brand new
[02:54:36] <Nasp> I also think most of the states nukes are old generation
[02:54:42] <BtbN> For what I'm aware, Europe has no Anti-Missile stuff setup at all
[02:54:51] <Nasp> megaTherion: Pretty sure they have that range
[02:55:00] <JakeSays> Nasp: our nukes are old, yes, but our anti-nuke stuff isn't
[02:55:11] <megaTherion> Nasp: then why is it important to bother with how near nukes are placed to the nato's border?
[02:55:15] <megaTherion> wouldnt make a lot of sense then
[02:55:19] <Nasp> megaTherion:  It isnt
[02:55:22] <BtbN> megaTherion, reaction time
[02:55:23] <Nasp> Or well it is
[02:55:27] <JakeSays> BtbN: we have a lot of anti-nuke stuff in europe
[02:55:59] <JakeSays> Nasp: nukes aren't used as a defense against other nukes
[02:56:08] <Nasp> I know
[02:56:26] <Nasp> But if Russia fire a nuke it's not liek people would just hope to shoot it down
[02:56:36] <Nasp> United states would fire back within 5 minutes
[02:56:40] <JakeSays> Nasp: depends on where it's headed
[02:56:49] <megaTherion> anyways I wouldnt be afraid of russia, would be great if someone gets air superiority in ukraine and clear the skies
[02:57:01] <Nasp> Ukraine is trying to get air superiority i think
[02:57:07] <JakeSays> megaTherion: i dont think that's going to happen
[02:57:23] <BtbN> I don't think there is any realistic hope for Ukraine sadly
[02:57:31] <JakeSays> ukraine doesn't have the hardware and they're having issues getting other countries to give it up
[02:57:35] <MatthiasVance> Okay back to not reading comments
[02:57:52] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Aren't they just getting 70 new planes
[02:57:54] <MatthiasVance> Lots of regular-looking accounts posting the same stuff
[02:58:00] <Nasp> But nobody else can give Ukraine air superiority but themselves
[02:58:02] <JakeSays> Nasp: from who?
[02:58:21] <MatthiasVance> Yeah they were "getting planes"
[02:58:43] <JakeSays> i read that hungary won't fess up out of fear
[02:59:06] <JakeSays> ukrainian pilots can only fly soviet fighters so the options are limited
[02:59:18] <Nasp> JakeSays:  It was in the news that various countries were donating fighters
[02:59:30] <BtbN> I heard Russia is in some financial trouble. Maybe they could buy some from them?

[02:59:49] <MatthiasVance> No jets
[03:00:10] <eurogos> War Games (1983) awesome
[03:01:01] <megaTherion> anyways... WW3 will break out one way or another
[03:01:10] <megaTherion> its not just about Ukraine but the whole past USSR territory
[03:01:14] <MatthiasVance> Isn't this already WW3?
[03:01:23] <MatthiasVance> We're just not shooting things yet
[03:01:25] <megaTherion> not yet, because nobody else wants to intervine
[03:01:25] <eurogos> its the bit before the main bit
[03:01:36] <megaTherion> ^
[03:01:41] <MatthiasVance> Yeah that's what I meant
[03:01:52] <Nasp> Countries haven't exactly joined, but it looks close to a WW3
[03:02:04] <Nasp> Looking at the sides and saying "poke him with this stick"
[03:02:11] <BtbN> I still have a sliver of hope left that Russia will run out of juice before they can break loose WW3
[03:02:15] <pandem> theres been a lot of wars, most of them were not wwiii
[03:02:19] <Nasp> If Putin didn't have nukes 30 countries would have declared war against Russia
[03:02:33] <eurogos> ^
[03:02:42] <megaTherion> Nasp: I wonder if they can nuke everything simultanously... isnt this like a hoax?
[03:02:54] <Nasp> megaTherion?
[03:02:54] <MatthiasVance> megaTherion: THe guess is that they have 5700 warheads or missiles
[03:02:54] <megaTherion> I mean whom are they gonna to nuke first
[03:03:00] <MatthiasVance> Seems plenty
[03:03:02] <JakeSays> i bet that if some country donated 70 F-16's to ukraine there would be no shortage of pilot volunteers to fly them
[03:03:05] <megaTherion> MatthiasVance: but you need more than just warheads or not?
[03:03:18] <MatthiasVance> megaTherion: Yeah idk :D Seems like a high number xD
[03:03:18] <pandem> 01:29:45         JakeSays | BtbN: LOL
[03:03:26] <eurogos> the only way out is if someone takes putin out from the inside

[03:03:47] <MatthiasVance> Those beetles from Mummy
[03:03:52] <eurogos> its the russian way

[03:05:32] <lz_> eurogos: maybe they're sad and they want to move to ukrain now

[03:06:35] <JakeSays> eurogos: unfortunately they're all idiots, so that's all that would be left - idiots
[03:06:54] <MatthiasVance> Yeah and the ones that fired the nukes
[03:07:00] <MatthiasVance> *including
[03:07:31] <lz_> eurogos: pretty sure it looks dumb even without nukes
[03:07:39] <Nasp> If those that fired the nukes survives
[03:07:46] <DevJohnC> EntityFramework really needs some sort of way to ensure all the providers can run LINQ queries
[03:07:51] <Nasp> Not sure how well those bunkers withstand multiple nukes on top
[03:08:00] <Nasp> DevJohnC:  Tests? :D
[03:08:08] <Nasp> Isn't there some analyzers maybe
[03:08:13] <Nasp> But i think it's a rather hard thing to do
[03:08:21] <Nasp> Do you want an easy way to just verify, or compile error
[03:08:50] <eurogos> DevJohnC, can you keep the c# chat down please
[03:08:58] <DevJohnC> Nasp, I mean, if I write a query and I know it works in sqlite or postgresql it should work in mysql and not throw can't compile expression exceptions at me
[03:09:07] <DevJohnC> it's so hard to know what each provider actually supports
[03:09:09] <DevJohnC> it's insane
[03:09:21] <Nasp> Yeah but how, by limiting the functions to lowest common denominator?
[03:09:42] <DevJohnC> idk, but something ! it's just a stupid leaky abstraction as it is now
[03:09:43] <Nasp> But i would assume an analyzer could do something
[03:09:46] <DevJohnC> and it's irritating!
[03:10:12] <Nasp> Sqlite is sqlite, it has a lot of stuff it doesn't support
[03:11:07] <megaTherion> anyways I dont see how the west, europe or USA (no matter whom) can accept with russia to continue if they dont get rid of their nukes
[03:11:11] <megaTherion> pretty much impossible
[03:11:24] <DevJohnC> but the provider is written by MS so it does more than mysql
[03:11:36] <eurogos> i have one shared EF library that works on both sqlite and sqlserver and there have been ocasions where I have had to write two ef queries
[03:11:46] <BtbN> I don't see how anybody can continue with Nuke, no matter what country. But here we are.
[03:11:49] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: Why are you trying to be compatible with so many things?
[03:11:56] <BtbN> Imagine if the old orange man gets back into power in two years...
[03:12:03] <MatthiasVance> Yeah I am glad that is not the case now
[03:12:10] <megaTherion> BtbN: I dont think he was worse than Putin
[03:12:34] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, because I wrote proof of concept in sqlite and now I need to support mysql to develop real thing
[03:12:41] <BtbN> I don't want either of them anywhere near the control panel of nukes
[03:12:50] <BtbN> In fact, I don't want there to be a control panel for nukes. Anywhere.
[03:12:57] <MatthiasVance> I actually saw Trump making a good point at a dinner. He asked Germany why they were still paying so much for Russian energy while they had a pact with NATO
[03:13:12] <lz_> can we just fast forward 3 months please
[03:13:20] <eurogos> madmax
[03:13:22] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Not possible, limit of this graph is 2 weeks.
[03:13:27] <MatthiasVance> lz_: Then it all eneds.
[03:13:30] <MatthiasVance> (sorry)
[03:13:44] <MatthiasVance> BtbN: Agreed! Someone will always hide something though :P
[03:14:24] <Nasp> megaTherion:  I dont think Russia will lay down their nukes unless someone beats them completely
[03:14:38] <megaTherion> thats one option
[03:14:41] <BtbN> It's a conflicting thing. Cause really, the peaceful times we had are largecly because of nukes. But I'd have hoped we are over that. But apparently not.
[03:15:01] <Nasp> Let's hope their economy gets completely destroyed
[03:15:06] <megaTherion> ^
[03:15:07] <MatthiasVance> Well also not
[03:15:17] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Why not
[03:15:26] <MatthiasVance> People live in Russia
[03:15:33] <MatthiasVance> That are disgusted by what is happening
[03:15:34] <lz_> BtbN: I don't think nukes are needed now. See what's happening to russia: banks, internet services, social networks
[03:15:36] <DevJohnC> because it hurts everyday Russians?
[03:15:55] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  So?
[03:16:05] <Nasp> I just heard of some people turning off their gasheater
[03:16:06] <BtbN> I have a bunch of friends and people I losely know and play online games with from russia. They're all devastated.
[03:16:23] <lz_> BtbN: countries can be rendered totally useless without a single weapon I think. there's really no need for any nuke
[03:16:40] <Nasp> DevJohnC:  Isn't that the EXACT point
[03:16:52] <BtbN> Yeah, the plan of intertwining the global economy to ensure peace did work, kinda
[03:17:00] <BtbN> now if only there were no nukes anymore
[03:18:12] <megaTherion> its boring without nukes
[03:18:15] <BtbN> It's also what baffles me so much about what Putin is doing. Like, he must be aware that he depends on most of the rest of the world to keep the country going.
[03:18:23] <megaTherion> anyways why are we having this stupid alert states... cant we just throw nukes immediadly?
[03:18:37] <MatthiasVance> megaTherion: Because you can't take them back is why
[03:18:45] <megaTherion> we dont want to take 'em back
[03:18:46] <megaTherion> *pff*
[03:18:48] <Nasp> Words hurt man
[03:19:00] <Nasp> megaTherion:  Firing a nuke would be the same as jumping of a cliff
[03:19:01] <lz_> there is/was actually a global effort to remove nukes. I don't know how the current events will affect them
[03:19:17] <megaTherion> Im just not afraid of russians, sorry - you can die only once anyways
[03:19:33] <BtbN> I'd like to not turn this planet to ash.
[03:19:42] <megaTherion> I dont think the planet will be turned into ash, humans will be
[03:19:50] <lz_> see the chart: https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons
[03:20:13] <lz_> and btw: holy shit. Didn't realize how it was in 1985
[03:20:28] <BtbN> Yeah, they made a huge effort to reduce and get rid of them
[03:20:40] <BtbN> and the time it stopped suspiciously aligns with Putin getting into power
[03:20:41] <Nasp> lz_:  Russia backed out of it years ago
[03:21:26] <Nasp> But yes the cold was strange
[03:21:33] <Nasp> "I can nuke you 1000 times"
[03:21:37] <Nasp> "I can now nuke you 5000 times"
[03:21:40] <megaTherion> :D
[03:21:41] <lz_> lol
[03:21:45] <Nasp> "HA i can now nuke you 60000 times"
[03:21:49] <lz_> see how big my pp is
[03:22:10] <megaTherion> its how humans do... if you cant use it, at least be a collector of things
[03:22:22] <Nasp> I'm still surprised North Korea wasn't nuked before they finished theirs
[03:22:23] <megaTherion> like in "my atom bomb collection"
[03:22:33] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Because of people
[03:22:36] <Nasp> "Hey South Korea, you'll soon get some more parkign space"
[03:22:37] <eurogos> as long as nukes can be made there will always be nukes, the only way to live with them is to have mutually assured destruction
[03:23:02] <BtbN> well, there's a huge difference between having tens of thousands of them on the ready, and being able to build them
[03:23:04] <Nasp> eurogos:  It only requires one lunatic
[03:23:07] <megaTherion> eurogos: that was the way.. but what if some state has nothing too loose or if there is just some mad man.. its different with the situation in the cold war
[03:23:11] <Nasp> And look who's in charge
[03:23:15] <moose> Does anyone here do any Discord API integration stuff that wouldn't mind a PM? Ideally someone who has done more than just used a library, but more like written a library or integrated directly.
[03:23:31] <Nasp> lz_:  Also the number of tests done with nukes is surprisingly high
[03:23:35] <Nasp> IT was the hottest thing back then
[03:23:44] <megaTherion> someone knows this game with flowers? "To nuke... not to nuke... to nuke...."
[03:23:52] <BtbN> One would hope that Russia still has enough people in power with something to loose, that can stop Putin.
[03:24:11] <MatthiasVance> The table is too long BtbN
[03:24:21] <megaTherion> BtbN: Im sure the western world would take all sanctions back if they can kill putin themselfs
[03:24:34] <MatthiasVance> No

[03:26:19] <eurogos> the tsar
[03:26:20] <irwiss> lz_: we're not because now the "normal" nuke is thermonuclear devices
[03:26:26] <megaTherion> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXSUEU7ISfQ

[03:27:17] <megaTherion> ya the good nuclear tests all happened afterwards
[03:27:39] <JakeSays> most modern nukes are configurable (dial-a-nuke)

[03:29:57] <MatthiasVance> Makes sense to have it for tiny targets?
[03:30:07] <lz_> not my pp plz
[03:30:17] <moose> yes MatthiasVance, something as small as a power station to as large as a major metro area
[03:30:34] <Nasp> `Variable yield, or dial-a-yield, is an option available on most modern nuclear weapons. It allows the operator to specify a weapon's yield, or explosive power, allowing a single design to be used in different situations. For example, the Mod-10 B61 bomb had selectable explosive yields of 0.3, 5, 10 or 80 kilotons, depending on how the ground crew set a dial inside the casing when it was loaded onto an aircraft.`
[03:30:41] <Nasp> But i have a feeling many are fixed to just say fuck you
[03:30:41] <MatthiasVance> TLDR nasp
[03:30:43] <Nasp> Since you don't have time
[03:30:55] <Nasp> Yeah it didnt look that long on the page
[03:31:02] <JakeSays> what i didn't realize is some fission nukes tiny have fusion boosters
[03:31:23] <moose> There are different types of nuclear weapons. Dial a yield is considered dual purpose tactical and the stuff like SLBMs and ICBMs for first wave targets are strategic very high yield devices
[03:31:41] <JakeSays> yup
[03:31:52] <Nasp> JakeSays:  You mean opposite
[03:31:59] <moose> The strategic weapons are used to destroy anti-missile and anti-aircraft technology and "uncover" the secondary launch sites to prevent failure of delivery
[03:32:00] <JakeSays> Nasp: i don't
[03:32:01] <lz_> lol after being very knowledgeable in pandemics everyone is gonna know everything about nukes. how cool is this
[03:32:06] <Nasp> Or maybe that's what you are saying, fission to start fusion
[03:32:14] <moose> lz_: I am a health physicist.
[03:32:18] <moose> I have to know about nukes lol
[03:32:34] <eurogos> pick the tsar bomb option (50Mt) on this --> https://outrider.org/nuclear-weapons/interactive/bomb-blast
[03:32:35] <JakeSays> Nasp: yes, fusion bombs have fissile first stages, but there are some fissile nukes that have small fusion boosters
[03:32:44] <Nasp> Hmm interesting
[03:32:48] <Nasp> I thought that was harder to do
[03:32:59] <JakeSays> eurogos: it's actually a 100MT bomb that was dialed back to 50
[03:33:34] <Nasp> 50MT was already over the top
[03:33:35] <JakeSays> Nasp: they're very small boosters that add neutrons to the fission process, but apparently they have a big impact on yield
[03:33:44] <lz_> i'm in the fireball zone, cool
[03:34:22] *** Quits: JD-Robbs (~JD-Robbs_@95.148.8.161) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:34:33] <moose> lz_: depends on where it hits though
[03:34:40] <eurogos> does the heat zone mean death?
[03:34:47] <megaTherion> I guess so?
[03:34:48] <moose> outdoors? yes most certainly.
[03:34:52] <lz_> moose: well i hope the military uses the same website to pick their targets
[03:34:52] <Nasp> Pretty sure
[03:34:54] <megaTherion> isnt it like 1000C or what?
[03:35:04] <megaTherion> (or whatever it is in F)
[03:35:14] <Nasp> I wonder what kind of nukes that's seemed as the ultimate weapon
[03:35:26] <Nasp> Like Large nukes aren't exactly easy to put on a missile i expect?
[03:35:27] <JakeSays> Nasp: pretty much any nuke
[03:35:47] <JakeSays> Nasp: that's where all the large nukes are - on missiles
[03:36:06] <Nasp> Well what's large
[03:36:12] <Nasp> Like i'm thinking MT sized
[03:36:12] <eurogos> those icbms are massive
[03:36:29] <Nasp> Comapared to smaller nukes
[03:36:39] <JakeSays> iirc our icbms have up to 16 1.1mt mirv's
[03:37:04] <JakeSays> although i think they're limited by treaty to 8 or 12
[03:37:13] <JakeSays> 8'ish, but whose countin'
[03:37:51] <JakeSays> turns out that 8 1.1mt bombs are much more effective than one 9mt bomb
[03:38:13] <Nasp> That's kinda what i was trying to say
[03:38:25] <eurogos> if you live in europe theres absolutely no point prepping is there
[03:38:32] <moose> there is
[03:38:34] <Nasp> I wonder if Russia have made something 100MT+
[03:38:39] <moose> prepping can be quite simple, eurogos
[03:38:48] <JakeSays> Nasp: they made one: tsar bomba
[03:38:49] <eurogos> but look at the heat zone
[03:38:55] <Nasp> eurogos:  Prepping for what?
[03:38:57] <moose> eurogos: for what specifically?
[03:39:09] <eurogos> survive after the nukes explode
[03:39:33] <Nasp> It's not like a single nuke can take out all Europe
[03:39:48] <megaTherion> just a question, if we always take about nuclear bombs - are we also including hydrogen bombs?
[03:39:57] <Nasp> Yes
[03:40:07] <megaTherion> ah ok
[03:40:24] <moose> eurogos: so basically if you survive the initial blast, your odds of survival are quite high if you just do some basic stuff
[03:40:58] <JakeSays> megaTherion: actually i dont think there are that many hydrogen bombs
[03:41:01] <megaTherion> moose: but is it worth surviving with two heads, three legs and six arms?
[03:41:03] <eurogos> moose, but that heat zone is so wide
[03:41:12] <megaTherion> JakeSays: I only thought about the old russian tests with this
[03:41:22] <moose> eurogos: yeah but inside a building this will be dissipated quite a bit
[03:42:06] <moose> the heat wave that comes is in the form of very high pressure shockwave with high heat, being outdoors is bad. stay indoors. your biggest risk is actually vaporization in the initial blast OR the vacuum that follows the explosion ripping your building apart
[03:42:09] <DoofusCanadensis> mutations aren't going to happen immediately
[03:42:23] <moose> DoofusCanadensis: or likely at all if you follow some specific rules
[03:42:28] <megaTherion> wasnt meant that serious :D
[03:42:36] <JakeSays> that website isn't very accurate
[03:42:46] <eurogos> i hope not
[03:42:48] <moose> JakeSays: it ignores terrain and common detonation strategies too
[03:43:16] <JakeSays> the tsar bomb kills as many people as fat boy if dropped on my house
[03:43:21] <eurogos> might move to saint helena
[03:43:22] <lz_> moose: do you think one feels anything when vaporized? because right now I really like the idea
[03:43:23] <moose> eurogos: if you're in the middle of a city and the city is struck directly where you're at, you're dead. if you are in the city and it hits the port that is 15 miles away, you'll probably survive any nuclear device
[03:43:35] <moose> lz_: no, it would be instantaneous death and you would be atomized
[03:43:48] <moose> literally stripped into carbon
[03:43:55] <lz_> i wish
[03:44:01] <Nasp> moose:  No heat wave covers entire Europe
[03:44:07] <moose> Nasp: correct
[03:44:13] <JakeSays> yeah that site sucks
[03:44:14] <Nasp> So not sure iget it
[03:44:15] <DoofusCanadensis> unless they wait until summer to launch
[03:44:22] <Nasp> The old nukemap was much better
[03:44:28] <eurogos> but there wouldnt just be one, there would be 100s
[03:45:03] <moose> Nasp: think of it like sunlight - you may get indirect heating if you're behind a tall building in the shade but it's much lower
[03:45:13] <moose> if you're deep in a city, that blast is attenuated by all of the structures
[03:45:15] <lz_> ideal scenario would be to be one of the first targets, to avoid having to witness the rest
[03:45:36] <eurogos> the mutations
[03:45:49] <lz_> i should move to paris :D

[03:46:09] <JakeSays> moose: much less so for an air bust
[03:46:23] <JakeSays> which most are iirc
[03:46:25] <Nasp> lz_:  And preferably be close enough that you dont get the option to think "FUUUUUCK"
[03:46:26] <moose> Nasp: correct, so actually being in a city is safer in the modern detonation strategies
[03:46:54] <moose> air bursts generate massive pressure waves in a sphere but they're spread out so much when they hit the ground, the targets directly below are hit the most but anything to the sides will receive much less backpressure when the wave passes
[03:47:08] <moose> it's less destructive to buildings, in fact
[03:47:12] <lz_> Nasp: one day while doing martial arts i got kicked in the throat. couldn't breathe for what felt like an eternity, but it also felt so relieving
[03:47:21] <lz_> I really thought "oh so that's it, nevermind"
[03:47:42] <JakeSays> moose: i dont think that's entirely true. an air burst has an amplifying effect of some sort
[03:48:03] <moose> JakeSays: it does, it generates a much higher peak pressure but peak pressure isn't what destroys buildings
[03:48:31] <moose> it also tends to spread a lot more radioactive material and generate a higher local neutron flux which can cause the air to become quite radioactive as well as nearby iron based objects, like pipes in buildings

[03:54:45] <lz_> moose: how is the outside air not entirely going into your home in 8 days
[03:54:47] <moose> no, because you'll immediately draw contaminated water into your system

[04:00:10] <moose> My water tap is one of those single handle things that does hot or cold depending on if it's more left or right, so certainly I drink from both hot and cold lines.

[04:00:40] <moose> I do.
[04:00:46] <moose> I tend to filter it still though.
[04:01:14] <moose> I mostly want to eliminate the risk of contamination from pharmaceuticals and heavy metals.
[04:01:33] <moose> That's quite common in most municipal water systems.

[04:03:50] <lz_> yeah no i think i'm fine except for nukes
[04:04:12] <moose> lz_: if you need to buy food/water for a nuke then you probably don't have enough for a massive cyber attack

[04:06:46] <Nasp> moose:  Yeah that helps, but hot water is still bad
[04:06:57] <moose> i mean sure
[04:06:59] <moose> but it's safe

[04:07:30] <Nasp> Yes stuff in the tanks and in the piping
[04:07:35] <moose> it's a good filter though, i bought a very fancy filter for it
[04:07:38] <Nasp> And there's more of that in the hot water
[04:07:44] <moose> but that also only uses the cold line
[04:07:53] <moose> i don't filter the water from my tap, sometimes i am guilty of just drinking that straight yes
[04:07:59] <moose> but it's quite limited
[04:08:04] <Nasp> Well tap water is fine here
[04:08:14] <Nasp> But  hot water main has more contaminants
[04:08:19] <moose> yeah tap water is fine here too
[04:08:21] <Nasp> Drink it or not, but in general you shouldn't
[04:08:27] <moose> i agree, heated water will have more contaminants :)
[04:08:30] <Nasp> Tap water is better than bottled water
[04:08:33] <moose> but whether or not they rise to unsafe levels? idk

[04:10:56] <moose> so my sink in my kitchen, if you fill up a cup, it's not filtered
[04:11:04] <moose> but if you fill a cup from the refrigerator, it is
[04:11:11] <moose> it has a water filler on it

[04:11:22] <moose> with the water and ice right on the front
[04:11:26] <Nasp> Ok
[04:11:46] <moose> i have a nice filter in there, it removes heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, etc
[04:11:56] <moose> and most water is indeed treated from sewage, in most of the world
[04:12:24] <Nasp> What, it's not like sewage water is going back into the water mains
[04:12:28] <Nasp> It's no the ISS
[04:12:39] <moose> my main water source is actually natural mountain reservoir water, from ice melt. but they cross connect it to the other system that has treated water from sewage in it. so it's probably a tiny percentage of my water.
[04:12:54] <moose> but the big cities, they all operate like the ISS yes lol
[04:12:55] <Nasp> hmm ok
[04:13:13] <moose> flush your toilet and it recirculates to a treatment facility which cleans it extensively and shoves it right back into the main water supply
[04:13:28] <Nasp> Many countries have water you can't drink
[04:13:30] <lz_> it's the circle of poo^Hlife
[04:14:00] <moose> they use mechanical separation for sludge waste products, huuuuge amounts of chemicals to disinfect, then neutralize it all, and then expose it to insane amounts of UV through tiny jets to filter it

[05:25:15] <JakeSays> jonp: i disagree with scotus term limits
[05:25:19] <jonp> why's that?
[05:25:46] <JakeSays> but i do think there should be rules as to how their selected
[05:25:46] <jonp> also, SCOTUS size is too small. :-)
[05:25:53] <JakeSays> it's not too small
[05:26:06] <JakeSays> *they're selected
[05:26:13] <brianonymous> its too small until the larger one is on the other side ;)
[05:26:21] <JakeSays> brianonymous: exactly
[05:26:38] <jonp> when is the last time D's had a larger number of justices?
[05:27:23] <JakeSays> i think that appointments should be made by alternating party.
[05:27:25] <brianonymous> does it corrolate to presidential party in power? honest question i dont know
[05:27:34] <jonp> *generally*, yes.
[05:27:40] <jonp> there are some exceptions
[05:27:49] <jonp> Regan appointed a rather liberal justice
[05:27:53] <JakeSays> in other words, regardless of which party is in the whitehouse, if the last appointment as D, the next must be R
[05:27:56] <jonp> but he wasn't considered liberal at the time
[05:28:36] <jonp> if enacted right now, would give D's a permanent disadvantage
[05:28:43] <jonp> last 3 were R
[05:28:44] <brianonymous> then my next question would be which judgements have been made were its been a problem of direct political bias?

[05:34:01] <brianonymous> thats jesus stuff tho, a whole nother level that should keep itself out
[05:34:34] <jonp> "too much" of the current republican party is made up of autocrats who don't want anybody to vote, and are borderline white supremacist
[05:34:51] <jonp> 1 is too many

[05:36:20] <jonp> are the far left anywhere near power? in the US?
[05:36:21] <brianonymous> yes, both are flavors of crazy
[05:36:44] <JakeSays> the right is always trying to get in my pants
[05:36:45] <brianonymous> not in an official capacity, but my moving the strings of social norms, very much so
[05:37:00] <jonp> and the right *isn't* trying to change social norms as well?
[05:37:17] <JakeSays> jonp: they're not
[05:37:18] <jonp> though i'm clearly getting too close to "both sides"-ism now
[05:37:31] <JakeSays> they're trying to keep old norms
[05:37:49] <brianonymous> the extremes of both sides is very valid and need to be kept in check
[05:37:54] <jonp> they're trying to reintroduce old norms, which the middle is trying, occasionally, to ditch
[05:37:56] <brianonymous> nothing wrong with point that out
[05:38:04] <jonp> banning birth control is not something the middle wants
[05:38:09] <jonp> it is an "old norm" though
[05:38:11] <brianonymous> no, absolutely not
[05:38:26] <brianonymous> banning birf control is cray
[05:38:39] <JakeSays> brianonymous: well, i'd say that the left norms are much less freedom restricting than the right
[05:38:53] <brianonymous> depends on what you mean by left
[05:39:03] <brianonymous> old school left?
[05:39:08] <JakeSays> well, whatever left social norms you're talking about
[05:39:49] <JakeSays> lol "first lady and second gentleman"
[05:39:57] <brianonymous> im trapped in the hell scape of being traditionally liberal, but fiscally conservative
[05:40:13] <brianonymous> there is no party for me
[05:40:26] <jonp> which is a hell scape of ensuring that minorities who were fucked over in the past *remain* fucked over
[05:40:40] <jonp> 'cause w/o fiscal liberalism, there's no money for them
[05:41:01] <brianonymous> thats not my responsibility what so ever, i will help at a personal level, not by means of mandate and force
[05:41:24] <jonp> "mandate and force" is also how the rich get all those tax cuts.
[05:41:34] <JakeSays> brianonymous: actually as a member of our society, it is very much your responsibility
[05:41:34] <jonp> and farms are paid even if they don't *do* anything
[05:42:02] <JakeSays> the "not my responsibility" line doesn't wash with me
[05:42:06] <brianonymous> but it isnt, because who gets to determine what is 'moral and right' in a nebulous, fractured representative replublic. such things should not be encoded to law
[05:42:38] <jonp> then nothing can ever change or improve
[05:42:39] <JakeSays> brianonymous: so then you give up your vote?
[05:43:10] <brianonymous> how so? how is my personal charity any less valid than the manditory type
[05:43:21] <jonp> there's less of it, for starters
[05:43:22] <JakeSays> brianonymous: your vote is the NUMBER ONE way you meet your responsibility as a citizen
[05:43:40] <jonp> brianonymous: remember all the child support payments during the COVID pandemic?  how many families that brought out of poverty?
[05:43:48] <jonp> …how they've stopped?
[05:43:55] <JakeSays> jonp: well, temporarily
[05:43:55] <jonp> are *you* able to bring those back, personally?
[05:44:04] <brianonymous> that was the govt giving people back their own money
[05:44:15] <jonp> that was the gov't shuffling money around
[05:44:22] <JakeSays> brianonymous: everything is the govt giving people back their own money
[05:44:26] <jonp> particularly at the low end
[05:44:35] <jonp> people can -- should! -- get back more than they put in
[05:44:48] <jonp> and those at the high end should pay out more than they get back
[05:44:52] <JakeSays> jonp: that makes no sense
[05:45:02] <brianonymous> the principle is moral, but the implementation is impossibly flawed
[05:45:15] <jonp> how me an implementation which *isn't* flawed…
[05:45:44] <brianonymous> but then it isnt about equality, but equity... and thats the dif I dont want encoded.
[05:46:04] <JakeSays> brianonymous: equity is the part that needs to be codified
[05:46:11] <jonp> so, again, those who were fucked over in the past have no recourse
[05:46:24] <jonp> and there has been *a lot* of fucking over in our history

[05:50:18] <brianonymous> it sure looked like it based on the body language of some of the videos ive seen so far

[11:58:26] <shadowchaser> on the other note, I have similar setup here as in previous job, I had a library which helped me a lot, but it had so much legacy and often redundant code that I’ve decided to write it from scratch here, best decision ever:)
[11:58:43] <shadowchaser> jmer both, but the latter occasionally
[11:58:59] <jmer> if you're paying for the developers they should just fucking do whatever you want xD
[11:59:05] <jmer> because you're paying them to do so
[11:59:19] <shadowchaser> jmer indeed, but it’s not always the case:(
[12:00:29] <shadowchaser> jmer especially one is a peculiar company, recently I’ve argued with them because they were sure .NET 6 isn’t MS, because real .NET runs only on Windows and they’ve read it runs on Linux;)
[12:00:44] <jmer> .... shadowchaser seriously?
[12:00:56] <jmer> I mean you can check that in less than 1 min. with 1 simple google search
[12:01:27] <Nasp> shadowchaser: So many people have no idea what .NET is capable of today
[12:01:52] <shadowchaser> jmer I’ve even started to move stuff back to 4.6.2, but this morning they’ve installed 6.0.2
[12:02:03] <jmer> Nasp: capability is one thing but believing that net6 isn't from MS because "they heard it can run on linux" is ignorant beyond any reasonable level
[12:02:17] <jmer> shadowchaser: why would you want to move back to 4.6.2 ?
[12:02:29] <Nasp> jmer:  Well same but yes
[12:02:33] <shadowchaser> jmer that was the only thing they had on server
[12:02:36] <Nasp> HAhaha
[12:02:44] <Nasp> CAn't you just self contain .NET 5?
[12:03:38] <shadowchaser> Nasp would it run on 4.6.2?
[12:03:41] <jmer> shadowchaser: you can't install new frameworks on your own server?
[12:03:53] <shadowchaser> jmer nope, they’re managing it
[12:03:58] <Nasp> shadowchaser:  It would run .NET 5 self contained
[12:04:15] <Nasp> Also atleast multi compile it
[12:04:17] <shadowchaser> Nasp didn’t know that, thanks!
[12:04:19] <Nasp> If you wanna go with the old shit
[12:04:34] <Nasp> Also would a customer really want a product that's already end of life?
[12:04:47] <jmer> multi targeting has it's own bunch of problems if you're using parts of .net framework that wasn't ported 1:1 to net5/6
[12:04:57] <shadowchaser> indeed
[12:04:58] <Nasp> yes
[12:06:26] <jmer> shadowchaser: if it was me I would spend time pushing for a newer .net runtime
[12:06:29] <jmer> I mean 4.6.2 is fucking ANCIENT
[12:06:45] <jmer> it released in 2016....
[12:07:08] <jmer> ... What I would be worried about is why I am paying consultant prices for people who doesn't know more about .net xD
[12:08:25] <shadowchaser> jmer indeed, that’s why I’m glad they’ve installed runtime for 6 in the end
[12:08:48] <jmer> shadowchaser: sure... It's still SUPER worrying that you're paying dearly for incompetents xD
[12:08:58] <shadowchaser> it’s funny how till recently I’ve thought Newtonsoft is the best, and now I try to avoid it
[12:09:16] <shadowchaser> jmer yeah, tell me about it:(
[12:09:37] <jmer> I haven't been in a situation where I had to pick between Newtonsoft and the new stuff in net6
[12:09:44] <jmer> so I haven't looked into it
[12:09:58] <Nasp> jmer:  It's really ancient
[12:10:08] <jmer> Nasp: newtonsoft.json?
[12:10:14] <Nasp> 4.6
[12:10:18] <jmer> oh yeah! :P
[12:10:24] <jmer> I mean 4.8 is fucking ancient
[12:10:26] <Nasp> Also newtonsoft is one of those i haven't gotten around to switcing out
[12:10:37] <Nasp> 1-2 years ago someone decided to add JsonConvert to everything
[12:10:37] <jmer> What's the benefit?
[12:10:39] <Nasp> So not as easy now
[12:10:41] <Nasp> Speed?
[12:10:48] <Nasp> Use the newly way to generate json
[12:10:49] <jmer> well I don't know... xD
[12:10:56] <jmer> I haven't seen that/read about it.
[12:11:01] <jmer> It just performs better?
[12:11:16] <Nasp> yeah
[12:11:33] <Nasp> It allocates less as well because it uses all the new span stuff

[12:12:36] <shadowchaser> jmer I just like that it’s one less dependency, plus when I have ASP app I can use this “accept json as an input to controller method and .NET would magically deserialize it”, and then why would I want to have another serializer
[12:13:11] <shadowchaser> I don’t care much about performance, my apps are doing pretty basic stuff
[12:14:21] <jmer> shadowchaser: most of the projects I have worked on hasn't really been hygienic in terms of dependencies so adding newtonsoft.json never really made a difference xD
[12:16:21] <shadowchaser> jmer plus you’re probably using NuGet for your own libs, I don’t;)
[12:17:06] <jmer> shadowchaser: well... If I decide Nuget is used for internal, shared stuff... But honestly, I've never seen sharing of internal libraries done well.
[12:17:26] <jmer> shadowchaser: often I end up questioning the basic premise that this code is even a good fit for sharing

[15:53:49] <hseg> no -- haskell has very little subtyping, so that wouldn't make sense

[15:54:27] <Suchiman> ah
[15:54:43] <hseg> so you can have common parameters but differing return types
[15:55:24] <hseg> (in re subtyping, haskell's only source of subtyping is in specializing "generics")

[16:39:37] <bomb> enough time to report you to the cops as a Russian hacker spying govt.
[16:39:53] <pandem> does your customer know what libraries you use?
[16:40:08] <bomb> interop_madness unlikely :\
[16:40:40] <interop_madness> bomb, yeah sadly
[16:42:01] <Suchiman> pandem: well basically we're doing "Data processing on behalf" which in Germany refers to the collection, processing or use of personal data by a service provider on behalf of the person responsible. And in our duty as such we've got requests from customers to confirm on whether we're using russian / ukranian software or not
[16:42:23] <bomb> interop_madness also, according to my short research, Ukrainian government is as crooked as Putin.
[16:42:36] <bomb> I don't know how the world's gonna sort this shit out.
[16:42:57] <interop_madness> bomb, true, but a corrupt government is not a globally destabilizing factor per se
[16:43:00] <pandem> how do you define if an open source library is russian?
[16:43:22] <irwiss> Suchiman: do customers know there's a closed source ring -3 hypervisor running in every modern cpu with full access to all hardware, so US 3 letter agencies are super likely to steal any gdpr data they want? :P

[16:44:22] <bomb> interop_madness I don't know man. even if Russia retreats right now, we have heavily armed/trained nazi militia with thousands of members in the middle of Europe
[16:44:24] <pandem> what is a maintainer, what if there are multiple maintainers etc

[16:46:04] <Suchiman> pandem: yeah it isn't really, but for sake of argument, if any of the persons with the ability to upload the nuget package, and thus being able to upload a modified package that does not match the source on github, is from russia, then that's the criteria

[16:46:49] <bomb> pandem Azov Battalion is officially part of the Ukrainian army, and considered one of the "elite forces" of the army
[16:47:04] <pandem> although that's why you should pin versions

[16:47:11] <pandem> i assume you cant modify a published nuget package
[16:47:23] <Suchiman> pandem: and the argument "well you can check the source" is the common open source argument that does not look good in the face of the log4j vulnerability for example
[16:47:52] <Suchiman> pandem: yeah that's true, nuget is immutable, you cannot delete nor modify a package
[16:48:26] <irwiss> bomb: tbh no one cares about those as they mostly hurt ukrainian russians, russia victory is affecting geopolitics tho so there's tons of parties interested in russia retreating
[16:48:31] <bomb> interop_madness yeah. double-edged wand
[16:48:36] <pandem> malicious intent might be easier to spot than accidental bugs

[16:53:15] <irwiss> bomb: imo it's less about "support" and more about selfish interests, the same reason ukraine couldn't join eu before the war, that'd require tons of money from eu, now there's tons of money invested in propaganda and astroturfing so no one cares about ukraine being nazi and anti-lgbt as it's mostly hidden

[20:29:24] <Xenoprimate> inb4 scam
[20:29:57] <MatthiasVance> I said I wasn't comfortable doing that but kept chatting for a bit but didn't get a better feeling for their situation so said I'd go indeed
[20:30:02] *** Joins: jamea22 (~jamea@189.237.57.149)
[20:30:31] <MatthiasVance> Worst case for them their help will take a little longer.. worst case for me I'd be out of at least EUR 300
[20:31:22] <MatthiasVance> Xenoprimate: Yeah idk .. didn't want to risk it :)
[20:32:29] <DevJohnC> that's so weird, I've heard of that exact scam from a video somewhere just recently, like within the past couple of weeks

[20:37:01] <MatthiasVance> They said they would have been okay with me taking pictures of them, their ID and whatnot
[20:37:21] <smitty_> i ran into a scam like that once, fell for it the first time
[20:37:38] <smitty_> then a few months later i ran into the same guy at the gas station and he tried it on me again and i called him out on it and he just walked away
[20:37:56] <xb0o2> MatthiasVance: where do you live?
[20:38:04] <MatthiasVance> xb0o2: NL, they had plates from UK
[20:38:13] <MatthiasVance> smitty_: Ohh!
[20:38:14] <xb0o2> ... and they were relieved that you could speak English?
[20:38:14] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, yeah bc even with that info, what you gon do? assuming the ID is even legit
[20:38:26] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: Go to the police? idk :P
[20:38:55] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, and the police will add it to the file of cases identical to this one lol
[20:39:01] <MatthiasVance> Yeah indeed lol
[20:39:10] <DevJohnC> I mean,  I assume - I'm used to USA cops who don't do shit
[20:39:15] <xb0o2> Like they had somehow tried to converse with enough people that hadn't been able to speak English that you were a relief?
[20:39:23] <MatthiasVance> If it were EASIER for me to have helped them I would have
[20:39:37] <MatthiasVance> xb0o2: I saw them talking to at least 1 other person before I came back from the shop
[20:39:50] *** Quits: Babbage (~Babbage@94.11.27.96) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:39:53] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, it's totally a scam
[20:40:13] <DevJohnC> if they have another way to send you money to pay for what you're giving them, have them do that first
[20:40:29] <xb0o2> My view might be coloured by only going to touristy areas but isn't English proficiency impressively high in general in NL?
[20:40:39] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: They said they'd transfer the money with their mobile banking app *first*
[20:40:57] <MatthiasVance> But I thought later, that would take a business day most of the times it being an out-of-country bank account
[20:41:21] <MatthiasVance> I am unsure how the scam would work that's why I asked more questions
[20:41:47] <DevJohnC> it's so weird, I literally heard about this scam like a week ago and I can't remember where I heard it, lol
[20:42:01] <xb0o2> Should just offer to buy them a ticket to The Hague and they can get help from the embassy.
[20:42:21] <MatthiasVance> They had a car and could pay for gas with their phone so .. no need for that
[20:42:31] <xb0o2> Then tell them to drive there and leave you alone :p
[20:42:40] <MatthiasVance> haha I just went away myself
[20:42:56] <xb0o2> The inconvenience is what you get for being helpful
[20:43:04] <xb0o2> I hope you've learned your lesson
[20:43:17] <MatthiasVance> never
[20:44:21] <bomb> should just tie them to your read bumper from their necks, and make them run while you drive...
[20:44:59] <xb0o2> I mean the other thing to bear in mind is that most of the banks in the UK will provide emergency cash
[20:45:12] <MatthiasVance> xb0o2: How are you going to take it out?
[20:45:22] <xb0o2> They authorise it for you
[20:45:32] <MatthiasVance> So if you have only an ID that would work right
[20:45:47] <xb0o2> You ring up, prove who you are, say your card has been stolen or whatever and they will authorise the cash for you at a given location

[20:54:52] <lz_> MatthiasVance: i've read this story countless times. Often younger people get scammed, sadly, because they're too naive and think people are good
[20:54:52] <pandem> maybe north african ones cause they are close to europe

[21:02:59] <lz_> on that note i remember a (fake) woman making sob stories on reddit and making a ton of cash with it. That was scary how good he or she was at making up the stories, litterally everyone was falling for it

[23:20:19] <Nasp> Whatever software you use for your queue / message queue
[23:20:22] *** Joins: JD-Robbs (~JD-Robbs_@95.148.8.136)
[23:20:32] <pandem> the dequeuer has no way of knowing if the transaction is over
[23:20:34] <Nasp> I take it this stuff after the request is something you don't care if succeeds or not
[23:20:48] <Nasp> When your transaction is done, put it on the queue to do the stuff
[23:21:28] <JD-Robbs> If I've got a List<Array> - how can I merge the contained Array(s) into a single Array?  (yes, the abstract base Array type) - is this even possible?
[23:22:10] <jonp> merge the *contents* of the contained arrays?
[23:22:30] <pandem> the request does like 10 different operations and after each operation we normally queue one item. So what I'm doing now is I don't queue if there is a transaction and then queue the items after the transaction
[23:22:37] <pandem> but it doesn't feel like a good choice
[23:23:14] <Suchiman> JD-Robbs: will they be all the same type? why not use T[]?
[23:23:18] <jonp> JD-Robbs: if you want the contents of the contained arrays, something like arrays.SelectMany(a => (object[]) a).ToArray() may work; depends in part on what those arrays contain
[23:23:36] <jonp> and why are you using Array?
[23:23:48] <JD-Robbs> Nope, they won't - some are DataColumn<string> and some DataColumn<double?>, let's say
[23:24:16] <JD-Robbs> Ah it's this Parquet.NET lib being annoying. Or me being stooopid
[23:24:23] <jonp> meaning `(object[]) a)` can't work.
[23:24:26] <Nasp> pandem:  Yes queue it after the transaction
[23:24:39] <jonp> JD-Robbs: it can be done, but perf may suc
[23:24:41] <jonp> k
[23:24:55] <pandem> or maybe i'll add a 10 second sleep on dequeueing... that should be enough
[23:25:19] <petererer> Build a list of stuff to queue, and then queue it on completion :)
[23:25:40] <pandem> that's what i'm doing now
[23:25:45] <Nasp> pandem: What do you mean with sleep on dequeuing?
[23:25:51] <pandem> maybe i'll make my pr and ask what my colleagues think
[23:26:17] <pandem> that it would wait always at least 10 seconds before taking an item, then the transaction should be done
[23:26:26] <pandem> and the queue stuff is async anyway
[23:26:30] <Nasp> But if you queue it after the transaction then it should be fine
[23:26:44] <pandem> yeah, i guess that's what i'll do
[23:27:03] <pandem> but surprised that the transaction has no IsDisposed property or something like that
[23:27:09] <Nasp> Does the consumer of the queue live in the same application?
[23:27:21] <JD-Robbs> jonp: Hmm okay thanks! Might stick with what I've got as performance is important since I'm working with big data frames. I've essentially got nearly double code - e.g. a brand for string and a branch for double?. Seems repetitive, that's all - but looks like the alternative is reflection :)
[23:28:13] <pandem> yeah
[23:28:52] <Nasp> And in memory only?
[23:29:06] <pandem> yeah
