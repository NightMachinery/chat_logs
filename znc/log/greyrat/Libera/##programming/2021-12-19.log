[02:40:55] <Intelo> Hi, I know this can be subjective but generally speaking, which languages are difficult most or even impossible to decompile? I guess javascript/ java are easiest. Assembly is difficult most, .net / c# is in between?  Secondly, which langauges are most fast in performance? I guess assemble, c, c++, Java would be (left to be most fast). Thirdly,
[02:40:55] <Intelo> which langauges are mostly loved by developers due to their smart syntax and features? I think ruby was one. Any others?

[02:47:19] <[itchyjunk]> __int__() in python*
[02:47:21] <oldlaptop> Intelo: assembly is extremely *easy* to "decompile", although you would call it "disassemble": assembly language is fundamentally a human-readable representation of machine code.

[02:52:54] <Intelo> sonny bjs decompile means this wiki definition " translates an executable file to a high-level source file which can be recompiled successfully. It is therefore the opposite of a compiler, which translates a source file in to an executable. Decompilers are usually unable to perfectly reconstruct the original source code, thus frequently will
[02:52:55] <Intelo> produce obfuscated code. Nonetheless, decompilers remain an important tool in the reverse engineering of computer software."

[02:52:56] <Intelo> momcorp yes. right.
[02:52:57] <Intelo> sonny I guess its rust. Not sure. Also wonder why.

[02:52:58] <Intelo> pyzozord correct. bigfest talent pool with best results. And it seems it doesnt work. correct again.

[02:55:52] <sonny> well, when you mention apple and windows together, that's what came to mind
[02:55:53] <oldlaptop> It's generally impossible to "decompile" anything and get the original source back out; even programs that were written in assembly in the first place will generally have had things like comments and macros that went away

[03:28:08] <[itchyjunk]> "Haskell is academic" seems to be this weird trope i keep hearing but doesn't seem to be actual case afaict
[03:28:37] <oldlaptop> LLVM is "academic" in the sense that it originated at a university, and is IIRC still primarily maintained by UIUC folks
[03:28:43] <sonny> ^
[03:28:57] <pyzozord> yeah that's not what i meant
[03:28:59] <[itchyjunk]> Mathematica originated at a uni too.
[03:29:07] <[itchyjunk]> Mathematica has a decent bit of commercial use.
[03:29:09] <pyzozord> and it's too late for discussion on English semantics

[03:30:41] <[itchyjunk]> It later became DARPA , D for defense
[03:30:56] <pyzozord> not Haskell because noone makes commercial stuff in it, and barely anyone knows it

[05:26:20] <[itchyjunk]> or some such quote
[05:26:37] <sonny> what does it mean?
[05:26:40] <bjs> sonny: i'm not sure what you're trying to say,  there are lots of technologies and companies use them and they want people who have experience in them.  Cs undergrads don't/can't teach people how to use every technology well enough for them to do a job with it.  It's sensible for a company to want to hire people who have experience in the technologies they use
[05:27:02] <sonny> what is the undergrad for then?
[05:27:31] <bjs> sonny: e.g. a cs undergrad might "teach" someone some C,  but a company hiring for a particular role building systems software might want someone who actually has experience doing that
[05:28:13] <bjs> sonny: well, to teach them the fundamentals of computer science, enough for them to understand and to start a career in software engineering if they want
[05:28:43] <sonny> yes, the language is an entirely secondary tool to exercise what they have learned
[05:28:57] <sonny> the principles are very general
[05:29:46] <bjs> sonny: yes but the language (or library) might be a complex technology that a real software company uses a lot and wants to hire people that know how to use it.
[05:30:14] <bjs> It depends on what the company wants from its new hire, how senior they want them to be, what role they want them to have
[05:30:22] <sonny> yes that is my point

[05:40:30] <bayaz> Title: Quaternary sector of the economy - Wikipedia 
[05:40:47] <bjs> the point was to sonny, that it's not *just* about the money it's also that you want people with experience in those tools and technologies so that they know what they're doing.  the kind of job advertised for a cs graduate isn't going to want "mastery" of anything, but more senior roles may.
[05:43:45] <sonny> yeah, that point doesn't stick

[05:45:48] <bjs> sonny: i don't see how that's related.  If I'm advertising a job that uses a specific technology and Ken Thompson applied but had no experience in that technology,  then that would be a con to his application.  Depending on what it is maybe it's not a big deal and he can learn,  but maybe it is a big deal and his total lack of experience in that area would mean rejecting the application. it depends
[05:46:06] <KillerWasp> Not that it bothers me. Since I'm not into it. But I look at the classifieds and they make me think about it.
[05:47:54] <bjs> sonny: "knows Java or not" is probably not a big deal,  but "we do work in large distributed database systems and this person has no experience in databases or distributed systems or any of the tools or technologies we use" might be a reason to reject entirely, depending on what the role was.

[08:08:08] <InPhase> kveroneau: Shared text editing for source code was basically the first thing I thought of as an application when I saw your demo.  It's definitely a time when people are looking for new remote collaboration tools.
[08:09:23] <kveroneau> InPhase, that never crossed my mind.  The funny thing is that I keep hearing more and more use-cases for this after telling people about it.  Some other people thought it would have applications with embedded devices, which at the time I didn't consider.
[08:09:33] <sonny> why don't people like pair programming?
[08:10:08] <InPhase> sonny: Because most of the time it slows experienced people down.

[11:35:57] <beaky> nice i like the c programming language 
[11:39:47] <smallville7123> why do i get ffffff80    from     std::string x;   wchar_t a;    x += (a = 0x00000080);    std::cerr << "hex" << " " << std::hex << (int32_t)x[0] << "\n";
[11:40:16] <Decker> because x is a char - therefore signed and extends
[11:40:36] <Decker> char behaves more like signed than unsigned for comparsons like 'a'-'b'

[11:54:37] <Decker> but if you find a . next to a letter followed by not whitespace, you generally ignore any further dots and collect the hwole thing until a space as a token

[12:12:17] <independent56> Yeah, but we don't use modems, we use routers. With high speeds.
[12:12:41] <Decker> this also says "Alternately, you could download a program to compute pi and compute them yourself. Alexander Yee's y-cruncher for Windows and Linux is the fastest program out there. On a fast computer, it can compute 1 billion digits in perhaps 10 minutes"  so there's a target for performance :)

[15:38:14] <pyzozord> I don't understand it looks like I need to do way to many multiplications and sums
[15:38:37] <CaCode> this is the way
[15:39:17] <pyzozord> like for each cell of the result matrix I need to sum all multiplications for all cells in this row from A and all cells in this column in B
[15:39:42] <pyzozord> shouldn't it be that just one cell from A and one cell from B contribute to one cell in C?
[15:39:49] <GeDaMo> No
[15:39:51] <CaCode> No 
[15:40:05] <CaCode> That is not the way
[15:40:18] <pyzozord> strange
[15:40:28] <CaCode> yet this is the way :D
[15:41:25] <CaCode> so what can you say now, what condition do to matrices have to fullfil to be able to be multiplied ?
[15:41:30] <CaCode> pyzozord, ^
[15:42:44] <pyzozord> no conditions
[15:43:15] <CaCode> can any too types of matrices be multiplied?
[15:43:21] <pyzozord> two different sizes matrices can be multiplied the resulting matrix C has row count of matrix A and col count of matrix B
[15:43:31] <CaCode> exactly
[15:43:35] <CaCode> excellent

[19:37:21] <Matt|home> ugh.. what's the difference between 0 and NULL again?
[19:37:46] <pyzozord> python476: yeah probably
[19:38:05] <vdamewood> 0 Is an integer, NULL is a pointer.
[19:38:09] <GeDaMo> Matt|home: in what context?
[19:38:11] <Matt|home> ty
[19:39:11] <pyzozord> python476: but I decide to go without it, instead just prepare matrices for each case https://ideone.com/fT2aQS
[19:39:14] <bayaz> Title: Ideone.com 
[19:39:24] <Matt|home> GeDaMo : im trying to avoid undefined behavior in this C program, and i have an integer variable and a void pointer. im wondering if apart from the different type warning i'd get if i set the pointer to 0 instead of null would matter or if it doesn't make a lick of difference
[19:39:28] <python476> NULL being 0 is an implementation detail that one shouldn't rely on (some machines/arch may have different values)
[19:39:37] <Matt|home> so does it matter if i do:
[19:39:50] <Matt|home> int var = 0; void *var2 = 0; or void *var2 = NULL;
[19:39:55] <python476> oh i see pyzozord you wanted iterate(rot90, N) to go full circle
[19:39:57] <Matt|home> or are those effectively identical
[19:40:05] <pyzozord> yeah
[19:40:13] <python476> you lazy you
[19:40:13] <vdamewood> Matt|home: I'm not sure about C, but in C++ all of them are fine.
[19:40:17] <python476> (i like that style)
[19:40:28] <Matt|home> kk
[19:40:50] <pyzozord> not lazy enough though, about 4 hours now learning about matrix rotations...
[19:40:51] <Matt|home> ty
[19:41:01] <vdamewood> Matt|home: That is, in C++ assigning 0 to a pointer is a valid conversion to NULL.
[19:41:22] <python476> pyzozord: well you wanted to write your self so it had to take time
[19:41:31] <Matt|home> yeah it doesn't matter what the value is as long as it's not undefined
[19:42:13] <vdamewood> Matt|home: Well, 0 is the only integer value that's safe to convert to a pointer in C++.

[21:40:34] <BurumaSerafuku> it's (closed,open] interval
[21:40:57] <BurumaSerafuku> a[start:stop]  start = inclusive  stop = exclusive
[21:41:13] <[itchyjunk]> yes but a is zero indexed.
[21:41:15] <BurumaSerafuku> yes

[21:41:23] <BurumaSerafuku> yes!!
[21:41:26] <BurumaSerafuku> see? not hard!
[21:41:45] <GeDaMo> len(a) is 3
[21:41:45] <[itchyjunk]> so a[len(a):] means start at 3 and stop at the end
[21:41:53] <[itchyjunk]> right, len a is 3
[21:41:54] <BurumaSerafuku> that is a special case
[21:41:59] <[itchyjunk]> so a[len(a)] should be error?
[21:42:11] <python476> [itchyjunk]: you write funny code
[21:42:14] <BurumaSerafuku> a[indexed-one-past] = something --> include something
[21:42:17] <python476> i never ever assigned to a slice :)
[21:42:39] <python476> but a[...] = object seems logical that it affects the list
[21:42:44] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[21:43:03] <BurumaSerafuku> you can assign to that slice, but it's funny code indeed
[21:43:04] <[itchyjunk]> a[3] = blah assigns blah to 3
[21:43:11] <BurumaSerafuku> just do a[len(a)] = something
[21:43:17] <[itchyjunk]> okay then why not a[len(a)] = blah
[21:43:29] <[itchyjunk]> why a[len(a):] = [blah]
[21:43:35] <[itchyjunk]> why the [] for blah?

[23:06:32] <[itchyjunk]> going back to data structures.. how did you guys learn it?
[23:06:40] <python476> [itchyjunk]: yeah but the idea of describing an object through predicates / function is reused in all comprehensions
[23:06:40] <[itchyjunk]> implement random ones? used it when needed only?
[23:07:09] <[itchyjunk]> python476, didn't understand that. i know what an object is but what does decsribing it through predicates/function mean?
[23:07:21] <sonny> took a course, there's a few key ones to implement
[23:07:31] <[itchyjunk]> oh objects has data and method and using the method to interact with data?
[23:07:37] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, which ones are key?
[23:07:44] <[itchyjunk]> dict has a key so it must be key
[23:07:50] <GeDaMo> [x for x in range(1,10) if x%2 == 0]

[23:08:00] <[itchyjunk]> ah yes i can read that
[23:08:04] <python476> [itchyjunk]: set builder is {{ for all object, pick those where predicate P is true }}
[23:08:07] <[itchyjunk]> that is neat
[23:08:31] <[itchyjunk]> {x such that Proposition} right
[23:08:41] <python476> yes

[23:43:37] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: depends on what level of abstraction you operate. You do need 1d array called the memory :P
[23:43:42] <sonny> since those are all heap allocated 
[23:43:58] <sonny> it's basically memory
[23:44:33] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: in python you can simply create a class with field called next that holds another object of that class. All objects in python are stored as pointers
[23:44:45] <GeDaMo> You need a way of storing and retrieving data :P
[23:44:55] <sonny> I suppose you could create lists using lists in python

[23:45:18] <GeDaMo> You could also use dictionaries or tuple
[23:45:19] <GeDaMo> s
[23:45:24] <user51> sometimes i wonder how many data structures you need
[23:45:37] <GeDaMo> Lua only has 'tables' 
[23:45:53] <user51> well, what's the worse fit for tables?
[23:46:04] <[itchyjunk]> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[23:46:05] <GeDaMo> Nested key:value type
[23:46:15] <user51> what about trees?
[23:46:28] <GeDaMo> That's where the 'nested' part comes in
[23:46:28] <apotheon> simulate a linked list with tuples
[23:46:43] <apotheon> A tuple is arguably a "primitive array", though.
[23:46:47] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[23:46:53] <GeDaMo> If the value can be another key:value type, you can have trees
[23:47:01] *** Joins: Burgundy (~yomon@79.115.213.171)
[23:47:22] <macaw> ^ Yeah
[23:47:33] <GeDaMo> You could also call it a recursive type
[23:48:04] <user51> assuming they're multidimensiona, i guess you could do dict[node][number_nodes]
[23:48:05] <macaw> "how many data structures you need" => The oldest versions of Lisp had only lists and atoms.
[23:48:29] <macaw> With it, you could write everything you can imagine.

[23:48:45] <macaw> (Now performance of this... is another topic.)
[23:48:46] <user51> what's the diff between list and array?
[23:49:10] <user51> arrays have fixed size, and lists don't?
[23:49:12] <GeDaMo> The abstract types or the implementations?
[23:49:14] <[itchyjunk]> wtf i am confusing myself left and right
[23:49:17] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@c-65-96-171-157.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[23:49:23] <oldlaptop> "array" is generally a narrower concept than "list", implying random access (most notably)
[23:49:31] <oldlaptop> what python calls "lists" are actually arrays in this sense
[23:49:39] <oldlaptop> a linked list, on the other hand, is not an array
[23:50:06] <oldlaptop> (python is still correct to call them lists, in the same sense that it is correct to call a subcompact car a motor vehicle)
[23:50:13] <[itchyjunk]> okay, i have an object that can create another object
[23:50:16] *** Joins: sheepduck (~sheepduck@user/sheepduck)
[23:50:34] <[itchyjunk]> first object, lets call it IL can create a new object that's basiclly a tuple
[23:50:45] <user51> GeDaMo: abstractly, list and arrays seem pretty similar.
[23:50:58] <[itchyjunk]> now say IL has created 3 objects (0,a), (1,b), (2,c)
[23:51:07] <oldlaptop> They are, in precisely the same way that subcompact cars and motor vehicles are pretty similar
[23:51:13] <[itchyjunk]> now i want to retrieve 1,b via IL
[23:51:16] <[itchyjunk]> how does that work?
[23:51:16] <user51> but i guess the whole idea of "linked list" is that they're more flexible
[23:51:18] <oldlaptop> arrays are lists, but not all lists are arrays
[23:51:28] <user51> with arrays, i'm guessing you'll need a memmove
[23:51:30] <GeDaMo> [itchyjunk]: retrieve from where?
[23:51:36] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: you walk the linked list, that's how linked lists work
[23:51:49] <[itchyjunk]> retrieve from oen of those other objects that got created
[23:51:54] <oldlaptop> "array" is also often taken to imply a particular physical layout, with everything "contiguous in memory"; exactly what that means in practice can be slippery
[23:51:55] <GeDaMo> You said IL creates the tuple,
[23:51:55] <[itchyjunk]> my lists aren't linked
[23:52:03] <[itchyjunk]> does my list need to be linked?
[23:52:13] <GeDaMo> What are you trying to do?
[23:52:14] <[itchyjunk]> yes IL creates objects
[23:52:25] <pyzozord> how does it store these objects?
[23:52:25] <[itchyjunk]> trying to make a datastructure called ItchyList
[23:52:31] <apotheon> 13:18 < user51> what's the diff between list and array?
[23:52:31] <oldlaptop> Your list needs to support a way of accessing its elements.
[23:52:33] <apotheon> depends on the language
[23:52:36] <oldlaptop> Links are one way.
[23:52:46] <user51> but on the other hand.. https://old.reddit.com/r/awk/comments/dn3lh1/what_cant_you_do_with_awk/f5bg1fy/
[23:52:48] <GeDaMo> You build a list by compbin an atom with an existing list or an empty list
[23:52:51] <[itchyjunk]> it has 2 attributed, `index` which is int and `value` which are also ints for now
[23:52:53] <GeDaMo> combining
[23:53:07] <[itchyjunk]> there is no existing list
[23:53:13] <pyzozord> doubly-linked would be two ways, but stll only neighbors, otherwise it would be a tree or a graph
[23:53:18] <GeDaMo> Well then you need an empty list to start with
[23:53:24] <[itchyjunk]> all there is my ItchyList class and ItchyItem class
[23:53:36] <GeDaMo> data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
[23:54:13] <[itchyjunk]> i can think of a solution to create linked list
[23:54:17] <GeDaMo> How do you know when you reach the end of your list?
[23:54:18] <[itchyjunk]> i've done so in java
[23:54:32] <[itchyjunk]> i don't, yet
[23:54:38] <[itchyjunk]> the person has to know the index number
[23:54:41] *** Quits: independent56 (~independe@148.252.133.221) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:54:42] <pyzozord> how do you know where to start?
[23:54:43] <apotheon> With a sufficiently rich set of functions, a linked list could be used to implement an array.
[23:54:49] <[itchyjunk]> and if the person provides non existant one, gets error
[23:54:51] <apotheon> (re: previous discussion of list, array, and linked list)
[23:55:08] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: maybe just share the code
[23:55:13] <[itchyjunk]> i start with a class that can create another objects
[23:55:16] <oldlaptop> (for clarity: I mean links are one way of providing access to the elements of a list, not that they all point one way)
[23:55:26] <[itchyjunk]> i mean the code is bare minimum, doesn't add much to the discussion
[23:55:28] <GeDaMo> [itchyjunk]: so what methods / properties does your list have?
[23:55:34] <[itchyjunk]> currently none
[23:55:38] <[itchyjunk]> i want the bare bone to work
[23:55:40] <oldlaptop> apotheon: In some sense yes
[23:55:51] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: i'm a bit confused by your description, I think code would clarify that
[23:56:00] <[itchyjunk]> if i ask index i to be retrived, i just want it to regrieve value associated with index i
[23:56:13] <oldlaptop> perhaps a more robust definition is that an array supports *constant-time* random access
[23:56:23] <macaw> [itchyjunk]: Where do you hold the created (sub-)objects?
[23:57:14] *** Quits: CaCode (~CaCode@user/cacode) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:57:50] <oldlaptop> one could discuss these things at a level of abstraction at which time complexity is not relevant - at that point, I'm not sure the distinction meaningfully exists.

[23:58:34] <[itchyjunk]> macaw, that's why i wondered if i need some primite array to begin with :<
[23:59:22] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: ItchyList creates itemOne in the constructor as a local variable and immediatly forgets it
[23:59:31] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[23:59:38] <pyzozord> you probably forgot self.
[23:59:47] <[itchyjunk]> i can store it but it doesn't help
[23:59:58] <[itchyjunk]> because i can't hard code every element in the list being created
