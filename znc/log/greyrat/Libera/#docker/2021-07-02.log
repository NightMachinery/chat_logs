[04:05:41] <Bossi> when i actual request a cert from any public CA, my subject and altnames get published on Certificate Transparency Logs, easily searchable, so ppl see what hostnames are available, and figure potential targets, while dns does not allow hostname searches, just guesses

[04:06:32] <Bossi> a wildcard certificate will easily prevent this "social hacking" because you just see "*.domain" and you get no idea what names are in use
[04:07:00] <Bossi> if you not just use it for standard names like www and such
[04:08:18] <Bossi> and got advice is, use a separate wildcard-certificate on different hosts, which will reduce the impact if one key gets stolen, since also letsencrypt provides wildcard certs its no longer a matter of money
[04:09:06] <Lutin> Bossi just use caddy, it handles all your certificates by labels ;)
[04:09:40] <Bossi> and, the issued certs can be found on Certificate transparency logs?
[04:10:01] <Lutin> how do you mean ?
[04:10:49] <zoredache> if you request the cert supersecretsite.example.org, people can see see the site exists on the transparency logs
[04:10:51] <Bossi> the cert issued to you is published on those logs, so everyone can find them if the know the domain and can see which hostnames they include

[04:12:30] <Bossi> use of wildcards will not just put a cloak on my supersecret services, it will also reduce the amount of certs i need to deal with
[04:13:13] <Bossi> some of the certificate transparency logs contain billions of entries, on one i cant keep up downloading them all
[04:13:59] <Bossi> and since letsencrypt forces you to refresh certs after 60-90 days tons of data gets generated
[04:14:04] <zoredache> course there is a halfway point.  You could get a wildcard for *.private.example.org, and have per-service keys for everything directly under example.org, and if you have some LE client setup, it isn't like you really have to mess with the keys.
[04:15:00] <Bossi> acme.sh does the work, but i can reduce the count of certs
[04:16:17] <Bossi> and wildcards need to have access to the dns-providers API to enter automated records for verification
[04:17:31] <akik> Bossi: is it easy to move from certbot to acme.sh ?
[04:17:32] <Bossi> i work in the security department for several years, there is sometimes not an easy answer.
[04:17:57] <Bossi> dont know certbot, since i started using LE right away with acme.sh
[04:18:04] <zoredache> Anyway, on an unrelated topic, docker desktop isn't showing the tray icon on my windows system, but docker is running fine. Is there some trick to get the tray app to start?
[04:19:20] <Bossi> but imho acme.sh ist very easy to tweak, maybe you can "migrate" your current certs from certbot to it
[04:20:14] <Bossi> i created the setup early last year, since then i only need to interact with acme.sh when i need a new cert

[14:28:42] <artok> Lutin: yeah
[14:28:50] <usr123> selckin: So that means if I want to deploy my company's private app using docker. And I try to save the image to docker hub, the code would get pushed too?

[14:29:03] <gordonjcp> Lutin: I mean, that was a perfectly working config, that I am using in production
[14:29:45] <selckin> usr123: it does what you tell it to do, if you don't want to share code only compiled output for example you can set that up
[14:30:18] <Lutin> gordonjcp can you repost them, they are not in my logs it seems dunno why
[14:30:20] <usr123> selckin: Oh, I could compile the app on my host and then add that to the container.
[14:30:55] <Lutin> gordonjcp want to retest... caddy worked directly, that's why and I saw so many people with issues

[16:14:16] <Repox> I have an odd question, that might not be Docker specific. But I'm trying to setup AWS ECS with a PHP application I've made. And I'm struggling to figure out where to copy my sourcecode to. I've made two images, one from php:7.3-alpine and one from nginx:alpine - and I need to run PHP composer to install package dependencies. I guess I should copy my sourcecode to the Nginx container as it only uses the PHP-FPM container to parse the PHP files? Or should
[16:14:16] <Repox>  the code be on both?
[16:15:45] <artok> php-fpm is the one that runs your code, nginx alpine is only for redirecting and doing static files (if needed)

[16:20:23] <Repox> artok Alright, that makes sense. Thank you very much.
[16:20:53] <sudomannn> In the output image, it turns out the source files from the first stage have been trimmed
[16:21:14] <sudomannn> well, just one file. The last function in it is missing and I cant understand why/how
[16:22:04] <sudomannn> This is a python utility package, so the source files that i initially copy are supposed to be identical to the files produced by the install process

[17:53:08] <gordonjcp> this will add in extra options to what's defined in docker-compose.yml
[17:53:31] <gordonjcp> so if you've got a "complex" web app with a database and stuff on its own default network, you'll want something like this
[17:54:49] <gordonjcp> https://rangerovers.pub/static/docker-compose.override.yml.txt
[17:55:08] <gordonjcp> in this case the web server that proxies the Python app and serves the static content is a service called "web"
[17:55:33] <Lutin> yap I see taht
[17:55:34] <Lutin> that
[17:55:37] <gordonjcp> the "proxy" network is the one that we defined for Traefik to talk on, and "default" is the docker-compose default network for that project
[17:55:42] <Lutin> yes
[17:55:59] <gordonjcp> Lutin: I haven't fully anonymised that, where you see "rrpub" that's the name of the Traefik service
[17:56:16] <Lutin> gordonjcp oh yeah, no worries :)
[17:56:34] <gordonjcp> Lutin: so
[17:56:41] <gordonjcp> Lutin: sorry, router not service
[17:57:00] <gordonjcp> that'll show up in http routers in traefik as "rrpub@docker"
[17:57:40] <gordonjcp> the actual http service will show up as "web-flaskbb-docker@docker" because that's the name of that service and docker-compose project
[17:58:05] <Lutin> yes I see

[19:17:05] <xheimlich> I have a fairly naive question. Like full newbie. We have a deployperson in charge of these things, I'm just trying to understand them better.
[19:17:58] <xheimlich> Deployperson runs docker from a shell script with a number of options: multiple -e containing env vars that have passwords/user keys, for example. 
[19:19:16] <xheimlich> Also -v source:target because the project depends on a very large binary file that doesn't change and isn't in the image itself (which changes frequently as we run through the MVP sysiphean thing).
[19:20:09] <xheimlich> Now: I know that in principle (and if it weren't for security reasons) I could declare environment variables in my Dockerfile. with an ENV declaration.
[19:20:50] <xheimlich> how can I map a host directory to an in-container directory (which seems to be what -v does) in the Dockerfile as well?

[19:43:59] <programmerq> xheimlich▸ no, you can't specify a bind mount src location in an image. That must be a runtime option only. I would also highly recommend against putting sensitive information like secrets into a docker image too. you *can* but it's best practice to supply runtime secrets at runtime, not at build time.

[22:30:31] <Crell> Hi folks. I'm having an issue with a tiny Docker Compose setup not mounting files.  I run docker run in a directory with a whole lot of files, and ls still reports that it's empty.
[22:30:45] <Crell> https://gist.github.com/Crell/911b1bcae369bb3c74c6e6ac8f55679b - My Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files.  What am I missing here?
[22:34:12] <programmerq> 'docker run' doesn't look at the compose file. use docker-compose to utilize a compose file.
[22:35:09] <programmerq> you can bind mount with docker run too: docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/usr/src/myapp dummy
[22:35:13] <artok> docker run --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/usr/src/myapp dummy
[22:35:19] <Crell> Ahso.  Duh.  
[22:35:20] <artok> aaand I was slow
[22:35:21] <artok> =D
[22:35:46] <artok> that is because I use long format --mount and not -v ;)
[22:36:16] <Crell> Now this is interesting.  If I run `docker-compose run $service_from_the_yml`, it... runs my unit test command.  Which is NOT the command I currently have setup as a CMD!  (It's commented out for testing.)
[22:37:08] <programmerq> it'll use whatever command is in the image. commenting out something in the Dockerfile won't take effect until you rebuild the image explicitly.
[22:38:16] <Crell> I did rebuild it, though.  `docker built . -t php8`
[22:38:23] <Crell> er, build, not built.
[22:38:38] <programmerq> and is 'php8' the image that you have set in your compose file?
[22:38:58] <Crell> I... think so.  (See the gist above.)
[22:39:19] <Crell> (I'm very novice at docker still, so please bear with me.  Rarely needed it at the last job.)
[22:39:20] <artok> there is no image: under php
[22:39:23] <programmerq> nope, your compose in the gist doesn't have an image: key
[22:39:25] <artok> that service itself
[22:40:43] <Crell> Hm.  Wouldn't the `build` directive tell it to build from the cwd for that image?  
[22:41:04] <Crell> (I had this working a few months ago on another project, but haven't touched it since and forgot most of it, apparently.)

[22:50:11] <Crell> I feel like I had this down to a single command in the past.  Right now I'm doing this: ` docker build . -t dummy && docker-compose run php8` - And it does seem to work.
[22:50:27] <programmerq> 'docker-compose build'
[22:50:56] <Crell> So still 2 steps, but both from the compose command?
[22:51:58] <Crell> Ah, and then it seems I don't need the image key.
