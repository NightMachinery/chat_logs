[10:07:26] <MohdAariz[m]> Guys how do i set firefox as my default browser on dwm?
[10:18:19] <AryaK[m]> xdg-mime?
[10:18:28] <AryaK[m]> BROWSER var is used by most sh scripts
[10:18:35] <AryaK[m]> xdg-mime is used by most popular apps
[10:28:57] <MohdAariz[m]> xdg-mime
[10:29:01] <MohdAariz[m]> i want to set firefox
[10:29:55] * MohdAariz[m] uploaded an image: (13KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/t2bot.io/f30a27ed1c7a184e759670dbf1474b8c5dbb054b/image.jpeg >
[10:29:56] <AryaK[m]> or just remove every other browser
[10:30:06] <AryaK[m]> symlink firefox-bin to firefox
[10:30:09] <MohdAariz[m]> i need chromium for some shit
[10:30:39] <MohdAariz[m]> AryaK[m]: symlink isn't a command :skull:
[10:36:48] <klimi[m]> <MohdAariz[m]> "i want to set firefox" <- xdg-settings set default-web-browser firefox.desktop
[10:37:28] <MohdAariz[m]> thanks.
[10:38:23] <klimi[m]> does it work?
[10:45:42] <MohdAariz[m]> Yeah but
[10:45:45] <MohdAariz[m]> whenever i click on a link
[10:45:49] <MohdAariz[m]> it doesn't open it
[10:45:54] <MohdAariz[m]> i always have to
[10:45:54] <MohdAariz[m]> xdg-open <url>
[10:46:08] <Amit[m]1> <Abhi[m]12> "Don‚Äôt  get me wrong but you just..." <- Use Matrix and See the Result
[10:46:40] <klimi[m]> MohdAariz[m]: oh that's something completely otther
[10:46:48] <MohdAariz[m]> Oh
[10:46:50] <klimi[m]> s/otther/other then/
[10:46:53] <MohdAariz[m]> how do i get that then
[10:46:56] <klimi[m]> no idea
[10:47:03] <klimi[m]> haven't happened to me
[10:47:12] <MohdAariz[m]> Cuz that happened with chromium that i have installe
[10:47:13] <klimi[m]> what app have you been trying? firefox? telegram?
[10:47:19] <MohdAariz[m]> discord
[10:47:21] <MohdAariz[m]> https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/
[10:47:28] <MohdAariz[m]> with telegram it doesn't work also
[10:47:28] <klimi[m]> with discord i have one problem
[10:47:49] <klimi[m]> if firefox is not already opened, then it won't open firefox properly and just bug it out
[10:47:58] <MohdAariz[m]> yeah
[10:48:04] * MohdAariz[m] uploaded an image: (15KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/t2bot.io/822526438fff4b52ed84aa360fb32eb4b517aac5/image.jpeg >
[10:48:06] <MohdAariz[m]> this right??
[10:48:45] <klimi[m]> MohdAariz[m]: yeah this is what i was getting with discord
[10:48:49] <klimi[m]> i had to kill all Gecko threads
[10:48:56] <klimi[m]> open firefox manually
[10:48:59] <klimi[m]> and then click the link
[10:48:59] <MohdAariz[m]> i am getting this with telegram aswell
[10:49:13] <klimi[m]> and haven't found solution for that... it is only discord in my case
[10:49:34] <MohdAariz[m]> Seems like its more of a firefox issue
[10:49:41] <MohdAariz[m]> cuz if i try to open firefox it shows the same thing
[10:50:35] <MohdAariz[m]> found the fix
[10:50:40] <MohdAariz[m]> firefox -CreateProfile profilename
[10:50:40] <MohdAariz[m]> firefox -p profilename
[10:51:06] <MohdAariz[m]> seems like it can't set a profile permanently
[10:51:58] <MohdAariz[m]> Fixed it
[10:52:23] <MohdAariz[m]> you need to create a firefox profile and then it will let you open firefox and you need to go to about:profiles and then you need to make a new proflie and set it as default
[10:53:04] <klimi[m]> MohdAariz[m]: I have a profile by default
[10:53:16] <MohdAariz[m]> <MohdAariz[m]> "image.jpeg" <- seems like firefox after opening a link gets this
[10:53:44] <klimi[m]> And I cannot make another one because that would be a lot a lot of trouble getting all the addons and bookmarks and stuff
[10:54:00] <MohdAariz[m]> seems like its mozilla issue
[10:54:11] <MohdAariz[m]> mozilla got skill issue after not making a browser properly
[10:54:38] <klimi[m]> Well all browsers suck
[10:54:54] <MohdAariz[m]> lol
[10:55:05] <MohdAariz[m]> just do what bugswriter does webscrape and make a cli tool for it
[10:55:14] <klimi[m]> MohdAariz[m]: No, I hate that thz
[10:55:17] <klimi[m]> * No, I hate that thx
[10:55:19] <MohdAariz[m]> XD
[10:55:21] <klimi[m]> * No, I hate that, thx
[10:55:42] <klimi[m]> There is no alternative to browsers ¬Ø\_ („ÉÑ) _/¬Ø
[10:55:51] <MohdAariz[m]> ungoogled-chromium
[10:55:59] <MohdAariz[m]> or just go surf or opera
[10:56:19] <smud[m]> lynx
[10:56:25] <MohdAariz[m]> No fuck that shit
[10:56:54] <klimi[m]> MohdAariz[m]: I dont like chromium based browsers, they are just lack too much features
[10:57:09] <klimi[m]> s/are//
[10:57:21] <smud[m]> MohdAariz[m]: It's an acquired taste ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
[10:57:28] <JB[m]> Is there any study on strain on eyes using Dark Mode or Light Mode
[10:57:28] <JB[m]> Which one is better for Long hours
[10:57:41] <klimi[m]> > <J B> Is there any study on strain on eyes using Dark Mode or Light Mode
[10:57:41] <klimi[m]> > Which one is better for Long hours
[10:57:41] <klimi[m]> They are both equally bad
[10:59:00] <JB[m]> klimi[m]: Any specific study you know of ?
[10:59:00] <JB[m]> because reasoning for Blue Light is made up story by Big Pharma  with no actual evidence

[10:59:43] <klimi[m]> > because reasoning for Blue Light is made up story by Big Pharma  with no actual evidence
[10:59:43] <klimi[m]> No, blue light is true
[11:00:05] <JB[m]> klimi[m]: Bro no it isnt
[11:00:05] <JB[m]> wait lemme link you

[11:00:57] <klimi[m]> Isn't it different from what you said?
[11:01:24] <klimi[m]> Yeah those glasses aren't good
[11:01:41] <klimi[m]> But that doesn't mean watching as light screen is bad
[11:01:52] <klimi[m]> What in really happens is that watching on screen for prolonged time is bad
[11:01:58] <klimi[m]> Just get safeeyes
[11:02:24] <JB[m]> smud[m]: Blue Light Filter Glasses/Coating is just made up marketing Bullshit
[11:03:11] <Tor[m]> Probably cause the people who are most affected by blue light don't use polarized glasses
[11:03:17] <Tor[m]> ie pilots
[11:03:18] <smud[m]> hmm

[11:06:01] <Tor[m]> Like do what your body tells you to do
[11:06:32] <Tor[m]> But i prefer brightness in lower side as battery consumption is less
[11:07:38] <JB[m]> Tor[m]: Tf bruh
[11:07:38] <JB[m]> eyes > > > > > battery
[11:08:23] <klimi[m]> too much brightness is not good ... the same way as too little brightness is not good
[11:08:37] <JB[m]> Tor[m]: there could be some Lumins matching that could be done vs Eye strain
[11:09:31] <JB[m]> klimi[m]: And Yet we dont have ant Ambient Light Sensors on Monitor/Laptop

[11:12:40] <JB[m]> klimi[m]: nice, was reading an article...
[11:12:40] <JB[m]> It recommends to blink eyes often
