[01:14:32] <vdamewood> pyzozord: it? th represents two different sounds.
[01:14:34] <Gamara80> can I just generate a random 32 bit number then use like a hash?
[01:14:38] <Gamara80> like sha256
[01:14:47] <Twix> usually people use guid
[01:14:56] <Gamara80> yeah but guid generation is predictable
[01:14:57] <Gamara80> apparently
[01:14:59] <Hash> Gamara80: what?
[01:15:00] <vdamewood> Gamara80: It would take just a few seconds to generate all 32-bit numbers.

[01:15:30] <Hash> For whom?
[01:15:41] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Now, to clarify, I mean there are two sounds that are spelled 'th'. Not that there are two separate sounds when pronouncing th.
[01:16:04] <Gamara80> For a user
[01:16:16] <Twix> do want a unique id or some kind of cryptographic key?
[01:16:28] <Hash> Users don't need anything like that.
[01:16:35] <Hash> username/password is good enough
[01:16:41] <Gamara80> I dont really want to do authentication I just want to give a token that the user receives to communicate with the server
[01:16:59] <Hash> What happens if the token is stolen?
[01:17:07] <Gamara80> well they shouldnt have let it get stolen
[01:17:08] <Hash> Anyone with the token can then access your server
[01:17:17] <Gamara80> yeah its a public api
[01:17:17] <Hash> That's not how to think about security

[03:43:09] <[itchyjunk]> okay so i need to refactor my brain around this concept
[03:43:43] <flaknet99> it should be explained in $textbook
[03:43:47] <vdamewood> [itchyjunk]: It's convenient to say that the classes methods are the object's methods. But the methods are all shared by the objects of the class. In reality they 'belong' only to the class.
[03:43:58] <vdamewood> s/classes methods/class's methods/
[03:44:20] <[itchyjunk]> we dont have a textbook for this class
[03:44:20] <oldlaptop> Sometimes, people will use the word "object" to talk about an individual instance, and sometimes people will use "object" to talk about a class. (It doesn't necessarily help that Java has a class named "Object", or that javascript thoroughly confuses this whole idea)
[03:44:24] *** Quits: Twipply (~Twipply@user/twipply) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:44:42] <vdamewood> Personally, I only ever use object to mean instance of a class.
[03:44:59] <vdamewood> Well, I also use it to mean 'chunk of memory'
[03:45:00] <pulse> in some languages the difference can be blurred

[03:48:05] <novns> [itchyjunk], how would you call a method on two objects?
[03:48:07] <vdamewood> [itchyjunk]: ... because the objects are instances of that class.
[03:48:35] <vdamewood> novns: oneObject.(anotherObject)
[03:49:23] <phogg> [itchyjunk]: each class instance should have its own copy of the method and only be able to access privates on the same instance
[03:49:44] <novns> vdamewood, is that some weird js syntax I'm not aware of?
[03:49:54] <phogg> unless data is bound to the class itself, which is sometimes allowed (but you'd know it)
[03:50:09] <vdamewood> novns: No. It's pretty common to a lot of languages.
[03:50:30] <vdamewood> phogg: Wrong.
[03:50:54] <novns> vdamewood, what it does?  or a link to some example please
[03:51:08] <phogg> vdamewood: which thing?
[03:51:49] <vdamewood> phogg: Instances do *not* get their own copies of methods. And methods are able to access all private members of any instance of the class they belong to.
[03:52:16] <phogg> vdamewood: in the first part you are correct, but not in a way that aids understanding. In the second part it will depend on the language, but mostly no
[03:52:41] <vdamewood> phogg: Well, in this case, we happen to be talking about a specific language, Java, and it's yes.
[03:53:00] <phogg> if the context was java this was lost in the scrollback
[03:53:08] <[itchyjunk]> yes java :(
[03:53:17] <[itchyjunk]> how to people learn more than one language? lmao
[03:53:28] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: Typically one at a time.
[03:53:32] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[03:53:36] <[itchyjunk]> each time you learn it, you have to figure out who has access to your privates
[03:53:43] <phogg> [itchyjunk]: many parts of programming are the same between different languages, so once you know a couple picking up more is fairly easy
[03:53:56] *** Quits: Usr07 (~k@70.90.132.249) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:53:57] <phogg> the first one is the most mind-bending
[03:54:18] <novns> [itchyjunk], it's hard to learn paradigms, learning programming languages is easier
[03:54:20] <[itchyjunk]> yeah comming across a weird idea for the first time might be the reason
[03:54:29] <vdamewood> You eventually learn, "In Java data access is class-based", and "In Ruby data-access is object based."
[03:54:30] <[itchyjunk]> novns, that makes sense
[03:54:31] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: The first is usually a serious investment.  The second is a bit of a mental adjustment.  The third goes a little smoother.  Typically the 10th, 20th, and so on you don't learn, you just sort of switch to with some analogies and syntax adjustments.

[10:09:27] <normskal> yes i have to use python
[10:09:49] <normskal> its only got a python interpreter
[10:10:29] <corinthian> normskal: well, unless you decide to implement the codecs for Skulpt, you're basically stuck. i think you should consider using JavaScript. it's a better language than Python if you want to work in a browser.
[10:11:10] <normskal> corinthian so this isnt a python3 or python2.7 issue?
[10:11:19] <corinthian> normskal: certainly not.
[10:11:39] <corinthian> normskal: it's a Skulpt issue. try to run the same code in a terminal.
[10:11:43] <normskal> are there libraries similar to codecs
[10:11:48] <normskal> i can try use instead
[10:11:50] <corinthian> normskal: i would say it would work.
[10:11:52] <normskal> that dot he same thing
[10:12:56] <corinthian> normskal: why is it that you're using Python, may i ask?
[10:14:53] <corinthian> normskal: the web ecosystem is too tightly coupled with JavaScript for any other language to be used instead painlessly. on top of that, you're compounding your problems with using an online IDE instead of a transpiler.
[10:16:21] <normskal> corinthian mind if I PM you?
[10:16:24] <corinthian> normskal: you have to expect these things to break and choose you're stack accordingly. only the most basic tech (TCP, HTTP, V8 or Gecko in browser) doesn't break frequently. i would suggest you rely on that. it's common with new people to expect everything out there to work.
[10:16:38] <normskal> as i cant dicuss it publicly the script
[10:16:38] <corinthian> normskal: sure.
[10:17:06] <corinthian> normskal: i'm not an expert on Python tranpilation to JavaScript, though. i don't even like Python.

Also informations such as how your server is structured are useful to an attacker even though

[18:41:28] <dunkeln> amigojapan: ohh yeah...thats the issue. I think at their core python and js behave like prototype-based langs but these are just syntaxes.
[18:41:30] <dunkeln> I think
[18:41:50] <dunkeln> take it with a pinch of salt
[18:42:25] <dunkeln> u can have factory functions that can create objects in python that can behave similarly like in JS

[22:53:04] <pyzozord> right, linking

[23:15:04] <mawk> Izem: I tried to see how gcc is parsing -1, and I can't get immediately what gcc is parsing, but in it's intermediary language representation it's represented as the constant -1
[23:15:07] <mawk> so different from clang
[23:15:43] <Izem> interesting
[23:16:02] <mawk> 'int a = -1;' is parsed as gimple_assign <integer_cst, a, -1, NULL, NULL>
[23:16:14] <mawk> so there's the constant -1 directly in it
[23:16:24] <vdamewood> gimple? gnu simple?
[23:17:00] <GeDaMo> 'imple' could be 'implementation'?
