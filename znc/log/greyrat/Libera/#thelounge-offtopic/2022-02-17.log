[06:18:02] <xnaas> As a native Texan, johncs, I will fight you to the death over this.
[06:18:04] <xnaas> ðŸ¤ª
[06:20:10] <johncs> as an extremely casual linguist i will die fighting all who dare to suggest language is anything but a hot beautiful mess of nonsense
[06:20:33] <xnaas> Some things are sacred.
[06:20:38] <xnaas> some thing just ain't right
[06:20:47] <johncs> a'int that the truth
[06:20:57] <xnaas> I'll cut you
[06:20:58] <xnaas> :P
[06:21:01] <johncs> ðŸ˜†
[06:21:05] <xnaas> :D
[06:21:37] <xnaas> tbh the most important code I've ever written or will ever write was: https://github.com/xnaas/custom-sopel-plugins/blob/master/y'all.py :P
[06:22:00] <johncs> ahaha incredible
[06:22:07] <johncs> i made an irc bot sooooooooo long ago, but it was so much fun
[06:22:16] <johncs> was on a very small irc server at the time. prime time for such shenanigans.
[06:22:35] <johncs> visual basic 6, what a fun language
[06:22:49] <xnaas> Yeah; I moved our Discord group to IRC and it's so nice to have a flexible bot I can write any bullshit for
[06:23:10] <xnaas> very fun and amusing (and definitely "not ok" :P )
[06:23:30] <johncs> i liked trying to secure it in such a way that the admin couldn't the bot over
[06:23:41] <johncs> was quite hard since i knew very little about security
[06:25:43] <xnaas> ðŸ¤”
[06:26:09] <johncs> even encrypting something at all wasn't something i knew how to do. though I did make an "encryption" method that I think finally did the job enough... iirc it turned every character into three numbers that when summed equaled the value of the character (all ascii encoded of course)
[06:26:34] <johncs> the three numbers were picked at random. so the encrypted text would be different even with the same source
[06:28:44] <johncs> i'm quite proud of the ludicrous hackery I did to get around my lack of knowledge back then. I remember implementing a "distance between two points" function that had at least 4 code paths, each using the pythagorean theorem to get the distance. Had to split up the code paths because I couldn't figure out how to handle a triangle with negative side
[06:28:44] <johncs> lengths.
[06:29:06] <johncs> at some point I learned about the distance formula and had a good laugh
[06:30:14] <xnaas> oh my
[06:32:00] <johncs> can't remember how old i was, but that's gotta be from awhile ago ðŸ˜…
[06:35:02] <xnaas> now you have to write a node bot
[06:35:03] <xnaas> ðŸ¤ª
[06:39:06] <johncs> haha thelounge isn't far off from a node bot
[06:41:47] <xnaas> there you go; you've got your base sorted out!

[22:17:22] <xnaas> as for the history of IRC
[22:17:28] <xnaas> I think it peaked in like 2005 or so
[22:18:26] <xnaas> yeah, 2003-2005 saw almost 250K users on the largest network at the time (QuakeNet)
[22:19:14] <A_5h> xnaas :)
[22:19:47] <A_5h> I agree...what is the topic at the lounge....this server seems to be just programmers
[22:20:35] <xnaas> Libera (previously Freenode) has always been focused on FOSS projects
[22:20:38] <xnaas> so that makes sense
[22:21:34] <A_5h> .....and that makes me a n00b
[22:22:08] <xnaas> I don't know shit either
[22:22:21] <xnaas> I write bad plugins for my bot on my server and that's about it :P
[22:22:27] <xnaas> I don't know any languages
[22:22:43] <xnaas> If you want to just sit back and watch the world burn
[22:22:58] <xnaas> you could hop into #linux or something and talk about how awesome systemd is and you're so glad it replaced init
[22:23:00] <xnaas> ðŸ¤ª
[22:23:28] <A_5h> yeah I saw VLC had an irc client for help....the nostalgia and rapid response factor saw me jump at it...
[22:24:15] <xnaas> "rapid response factor"
[22:24:23] <xnaas> It's not called Idle Relay Chat for nothing! ;P
[22:24:49] <xnaas> It's hilarious to see so many folks come in #thelounge, ask a question, and bail in <60s
[22:25:27] <A_5h> im an outlier still there lurking
[22:25:29] <xnaas> good riddance, I guess â€” if they can't be any level of patient they're probably not worth the time and effort :P
[22:26:30] <xnaas> Someone asked me "why do you use IRC?" recently and I was like "barrier to entry" â€“ they then started posting screenshots of Discord servers they're in asking users to please not update members on when they're masturbating...those kinds of folks seem to mostly get filtered out by the "difficulty" of using IRC lol
[22:26:49] <xnaas> not to say IRC is free of trolls and such
[22:27:00] <xnaas> but, ya know, the volume seems to be less :P
[22:27:09] <A_5h> trolls....theyr are a friendly sort....
