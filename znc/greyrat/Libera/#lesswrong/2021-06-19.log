[01:42:05] <two2thehead> "In January 2020, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen won reelection with a commanding 57 percent of the vote. The result was a setback for China's Taiwan policy under Xi Jinping, and it demonstrated the impressive resilience of Taiwan's democracy in the face of a relentless pressure campaign from Beijing. These elections illustrated a paradox: Taiwan's economy is deeply entwined with the Chinese mainland's, yet Taiwan has proved especially resistant to

[03:45:58] <lizzie> I manage to have social connections with people with a wide variety of gender identities and sexualities, and somehow have not been experiencing this problem where I see them judge people *morally* for not immediately knowing/understanding everything about them
[03:46:36] <lizzie> and I wonder if you are interacting with more oversensitive people, or if perhaps, for some reason or another, you aren't as good as making them feel that you are acting in good faith when you do make those mistakes
[03:47:04] <Betawolf> Logos01: It's all the same thing: you attend a seminar, get given a checklist, lie a lot, and hope nobody notices that you've changed absolutely nothing.
[03:47:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> lizzie: Seems to me that someone reacting like that to someone else "not acting in good faith when they make a mistake" or w/e, is itself pretty extreme
[03:47:43] <lizzie> there definitely seems to be a bit of a tightrope situation where many gender-variant people will become highly defensive if they profile you as someone who's not likely to even *try* to be respectful to them, and potentially sabotage you doing so
[03:47:58] <LeoTal> I was surprised but not shocked at the women's stats, because I already knew that they do that. I was shocked at the men's ‚Äî 5 to 17 times per year!
[03:48:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> lizzie: ... I mean, in that case it's just entirely that person's fault, then
[03:48:25] <Betawolf> That is quite a lot more than I would've thought.
[03:48:37] <lizzie> Obormot\Arcturus: I agree, of course...  I think it's important to assume good faith when possible and patiently explain things to people
[03:48:50] <lizzie> but nothing is ever really anyone's fault, is it?  we are all preconditions carrying themselves out
[03:49:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bah, of course things are people's fault
[03:49:08] <lizzie> many people in the LGBT community have dealt with a lot of trauma and are not prepared to respond rationally to someone who just needs things patiently explained
[03:49:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, I don't know that I'd even put the onus on anyone to patiently explain anything
[03:49:18] <saturn2> it should be illegal to cry after age 12 imo
[03:49:20] <lizzie> I think it's often a mistake, but to say "it's their fault" doesn't seem helpful
[03:49:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Impatient explanation, or (when it's not actually directly necessary to getting a job/task done) even *no* explanation, is just fine, imo
[03:50:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> But reacting with hysterics is another thing entirely
[03:50:06] <LeoTal> When a lot of people are dicks to you, it's perfectly sensible to assume that a somewhat brusque stranger is also planning to be a dick
[03:50:16] <lizzie> I think people need to be more comfortable saying "it's complicated, don't worry about it," but the corrolary is that people who are curious about someone else's gender or sexuality need to be able to hear "it's complicated, don't worry about it" and be willing to drop it
[03:50:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: Perhaps so, but if the stranger in question isn't actually being a dick, you being a counter-dick in advance remains your fault
[03:50:42] <lizzie> there definitely needs to be a middle ground between defensive hostility, and taking personal responsibility for explaining things patiently
[03:51:11] <Logos01> Betawolf: "I don't know what I expected."
[03:51:19] *** Joins: torchic (~noturboo@2a04:dd00:2:61::7068)
[03:51:25] <lizzie> Obormot\Arcturus: anyways, basically, I agree with you.  Some people *do* react with hysterics and I agree that they shouldn't
[03:51:35] <gwern> today's gym shower thought: 'Sometimes I think to myself, "I'd save so much gas using a motorcycle!" Then I remember watching a young motorcyclist die after an old woman t-boned him, through no fault of his own. An obsession with 'efficiency' or 'CO‚ÇÇ' or 'the environment' is often just an anti-humanism.' https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1406027202727231489
[03:51:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: The most realistically expectable, so to speak, behavior in this case, would be something like "ah, my apologies, I assumed you were gonna be a dick and that was wrong" (possibly, at your discretion, you might add something like "I deal with a lot of shit in this regard")
[03:51:50] <lizzie> I'm just arguing that it's understandable as a trauma response from people who frequently get interrogated about their gender *not* in good faith
[03:51:53] <ggreer> I wonder how the crying numbers have changed over time. my guess is that men cried less 100 years ago but more 1,000 years ago (at least in parts of europe)
[03:52:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: And then the counterparty says something like "Understandable, apology [accepted / not needed]", and you move on with a now-friendly interaction
[03:52:55] <Logos01> LeoTal: 5 to 17 times per year seems a touch high.
[03:52:57] <gwern> ggreer: I think it's very culture specific. stiff upper lip in england, sure, but go to france or italy or greece and it's a very different dynamic, where weeping is an important public display of emotion. it's probably like differences in handholding and kissing
[03:53:09] <ggreer> yeah, definitely
[03:53:16] <Logos01> Like ... looking back on the last decade I'm closer to 2-3 years between incidents of crying.
[03:53:31] <Logos01> That would be longer if I went longer back in my personal history.
[03:53:49] <LeoTal> gwern: Er, like, at funerals? I'm unclear what you have in mind re: "weeping is an important public display of emotion" in France
[03:53:56] <Logos01> Come to think of it I'm pretty sure I never once had a "tearing up" incident between the age of 14 and 28.
[03:54:13] <gwern> the nakama swilling sake or whiskey, weeping at the tales of ancestral injustice, manfully hugging each other and swearing to never forget vengeance
[03:54:24] <gwern> expressing the purity of their emotions
[03:55:01] <Logos01> Admittedly that was in response to how often I was bruised and battered (by my classmates/peers at school) for getting emotionally overwhelmed before that.
[03:55:47] <Logos01> Only so many times you can walk a gauntlet of being stoned (having thumb-sized or smaller stones thrown at you) daily before you ... stop.
[03:56:00] <Logos01> ... holy shit how am I just now realizing how much of a crapfest my childhood was?
[03:56:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> lizzie: I mean, yes, perhaps so. But here's the thing about trauma responses, right: if I have PTSD from being in 'Nam or something, and you jostle me in line at the supermarket and I shout and assault you - is that an understandable trauma response? Yeah, obviously it is. But despite that, we understand that to be, nonetheless, *my* responsibility (in the specific sense that it's not *yours*, or that of any other bystander or
[03:56:26] <Obormot\Arcturus>  w/e), to deal with that PTSD, to get therapy, to do whatever - but certainly we don't say "yeah, it's 100% ok to go out in public and react in violent ways to ordinary interactions, and it's the responsibility of all around you to deal with that"
[03:57:22] <lizzie> Obormot\Arcturus: Yeah, totally agree.  But can we also agree that it would be the responsibility of society at large to take reasonable steps, when possible, to not go around further traumatizing 'Nam veterans during their everyday lives?
[03:57:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is also the case with many other conditions which are understood to be not a person's *fault* but nevertheless their *responsibility* for dealing with, rather than having a right to impose the effects on arbitrary others)
[03:57:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> lizzie: No, I don't think so
[03:57:48] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: I don't see the moral fault in being prickly and standoffish unless someone looks unusually trustworthy (either by obviously being Your People, or by doing a song and dance about it). It's inconvenient for people who want to befriend you and don't want to do a song and dance to do so, but so what?
[03:57:57] <Logos01> lizzie: Society in fact makes no such efforts for 'Nam vets.
[03:58:04] <lizzie> obviously the words "reasonable" and "possible" are doing a lot of work there, but basically, I do think that if trans people no longer face overwhelming hostility in public, they will be less likely to assume hostility in public
[03:58:30] <Logos01> lizzie: To the point that the VA will routinely have some of the largest fireworks displays each year, because patriotism. 
[03:58:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: Only if it's understood that "being prickly and standoffish" is a character flaw, and that anyone who chooses not to befriend you, or even be particularly nice to you, as a result, is morally in the right and not in any way blameworthy
[03:58:50] <Logos01> Despite how many people in said hospitals will reliably have severe flashbacks when exposed to explosion sounds.
[03:59:09] <lizzie> Logos01: well I would definitely also agree that is in poor taste, and that society should take better care of *all* trauma victims including veterans
[03:59:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> lizzie: Yes, as you say, those words do a lot of work, but just in general, no, I definitely don't agree that society at large has any such responsibility
[03:59:26] <Logos01> lizzie: Well yeah but we don't care about vets in general anyhow in this country.
[03:59:34] <Logos01> Except to use as virtue-signalling elements.
[03:59:52] <Logos01> Which, actually, is *exactly* how the left exploits genderqueer/trans people.
[04:00:23] <lizzie> Obormot\Arcturus: what kinds of responsibilities *do* you think society has?
[04:00:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh, pretty broad question, isn't it? :p
[04:00:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hard to answer that sort of thing except in the negative
[04:00:57] <lizzie> well you said thing A doesn't belong in category B.  I don't know how to address that without knowing what you think category B is even for :P
[04:01:02] <Logos01> lizzie: By keeping the gender-nonbinary/trans people in easily victimized state they make it easy to use them as a rallying cry.
[04:01:29] <Logos01> Which is why you see so many efforts to wildly miscalibrate expectations in said groups.
[04:01:29] <lizzie> Logos01: that sounds like a silly conspiracy theory to me
[04:01:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> lizzie: Sure, a fair point, but on the other hand it's kind of awkward to put forth a whole coherent theory of What Even Is Society And What Is It For in an IRC chat, eh
[04:01:53] <Logos01> lizzie: I don't think there's a secret cabal orchestrating it. I think it's more an evolutionary process.
[04:01:56] <lizzie> tell me more about these efforts to wildly miscalibrate expectations?
[04:02:09] <Logos01> lizzie: You're familiar with the concept of "normalizing"?
[04:02:20] <lizzie> yes of course
[04:02:21] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: I agree with the second part (that's the goal! the point is to get people to err on the side of leaving you alone), but I don't see how it's a character flaw. Do *you* out of your way to be super-nice to everyone you meet just in case they might turn out to be good friends? If yes, is it a just practical choice, or would it be a character flaw not to?
[04:02:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> lizzie: Perhaps the discussion has to dead-end here... I mean, we've hit some fundamentals, I would say, or close to it
[04:02:42] <Betawolf> I have no objection to people being defensive about their sexuality or whatever because I can't see why I would ever ask them about it.
[04:02:47] <lizzie> the LGBT community definitely seeks to normalize certain things.  We can agree on that.  We'll probably disagree on *what* they're trying to normalize
[04:02:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: That's a false dichotomy and I think you know it
[04:03:11] <Logos01> lizzie: Okay. Are you *also* familiar with the massively non-representative expansion of the definition of intersex conditions that's been going on for some time?
[04:03:13] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: ‚Ä¶no?
[04:03:27] <Logos01> To the point where, for example, far more common conditions such as microphally are considered intersex?
[04:03:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: "Be prickly and standoffish" and "be super-nice to everyone" are not the only options
[04:03:49] <lizzie> Logos01: ...no?  but if I understand correctly, actual intersex people are a small slice of the non-gender-conforming pie
[04:05:27] <Logos01> Exactly.
[04:05:38] <lizzie> exactly what?
[04:05:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> LeoTal: In any case, the point I was making is that we begin to have a problem in the case where... "being prickly and standoffish" is not considered any kind of flaw or failing, BUT saying "that guy is prickly and standoffish, so fuck him I guess, not gonna be his friend or make any more effort to be nice to him" IS considered morally blameworthy
[04:06:07] <lizzie> and Obormot\Arcturus, maybe.  I still don't know what your fundamentals are when it comes to the role of society.  Let me know if you want to hear about mine (I'm guessing not)
[04:06:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, go for it, if you can state them concisely!
[04:06:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But I have to afk for a while, sorry)
[04:06:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But I'll scroll up if need be)
[04:06:51] <Logos01> lizzie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex#Prevalence
[04:06:52] <Robomot> Intersex - Wikipedia [Prevalence] (Intersex people are individuals born with any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones or genitals that, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, "do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies".[ ‚Ä¶)
[04:07:12] <lizzie> also I'm finding your back and forth with LeoTal pretty odd, because who's "prickly and standoffish" and who's "morally blameworthy" are both subjective things on which not everyone has to agree.  There are lots of groups that have trouble talking to each other, and all seem to agree that the other group is the one that's stand-offish and morally blameworthy.
[04:07:22] <Logos01> Common estimates of intersex conditions put them at about 0.05% of the population.
[04:07:44] <Logos01> But there are certain segments of academia who push a vastly larget number -- such as 1.7% .
[04:07:49] <lizzie> Logos01: okay but what does the intersex population have to do with the social expectations that non-intersexed gender-non-conforming people have?
[04:07:58] <Logos01> They do this for ideological rather than empirical reasons.
[04:08:21] <Logos01> And the inflation of these conditions is meant to encourage normalizing a non-empirical notion about the strength of the bimodality of human sex.
[04:08:40] <lizzie> I don't know which number is closer to accurate but I'm still waiting for you to explain why it matters
[04:08:53] <Logos01> Hence all the talk about "the gender binary is a lie".  At the second order it's an absolute fact.
[04:09:33] <Logos01> But this is not compliant with the overall stance of people who have built their careers and positions on the idea that gender is almost unilaterally a social construct.
[04:09:35] <lizzie> it sounds like your main point here is that physical sex expression is more strongly bimodal, and that That Matters somehow...  let's presume you're right about these numbers because I have not looked into them.  What does the strenth of bimodality of physical sex tell us about the strength of bimodality of gender expression and psychology?
[04:09:40] <lizzie> I would think, not a whole lot?
[04:09:53] <Logos01> Despite the fact that there is copious evidence that it isn't: https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(99)70236-2/fulltext
[04:09:55] <Robomot> Should boys with micropenis be reared as girls? - The Journal of Pediatrics (See related article, p. 579 .)
[04:10:08] <Logos01> lizzie: Quite a lot is the correct answer, is my point.
[04:10:17] <lizzie> it feels like a bit of a bait and switch the way you make a point about sex, and then conflate sex with gender
[04:10:24] <Logos01> I'm not.
[04:10:30] <Logos01> I'm saying that gender is correlated to sex.
[04:10:36] <Logos01> That's not a conflation.
[04:10:48] <lizzie> okay, so explain to me why statistics about the number of intersex people tell you anything about how strongly correlated gender is to sex
[04:10:57] <lizzie> obviously it's correlated, and I think we all agree that there *is* a bimodal distribution
[04:11:02] <Logos01> Right.
[04:11:06] <LeoTal> Obormot\Arcturus: I'm saying your level of openness depends on what works best for you (how much you want to get closer to nice people, how much you want to avoid dickheads, and the base rate of each); that you're entitled (within some fabric-of-society limits) to choose that level depending on your own convenience; and that the correct answer to "but then I don't get to be your friend, and I'm bummed about it!" is "go tell someone wh
[04:11:06] <LeoTal> o cares". I'm confused by <<saying "that guy is prickly and standoffish, so fuck him I guess, not gonna be his friend or make any more effort to be nice to him" IS considered morally blameworthy>>. Leaving alone people who walk around with a huge "leave me alone" sign is a good thing.
[04:11:07] <lizzie> but your argument seems to be based on the idea that it's "more strongly" bimodal
[04:11:10] <lizzie> so what's the evidence?
[04:11:16] <saturn2> ok folx and y'alls, this belongs in #lw-politics
[04:11:30] <Logos01> But the weaker the bimodality the stronger the case to be made that gender is also nono-bimodal.
[04:11:32] <lizzie> seems reasonable.  I can join there
[04:11:56] <saturn2> ty
[04:12:58] <PlanckWalk> Are ou sure that "bimodal" is the right word there?  Normally it refers to a function or density distribution having exactly two local maxima.
[04:13:20] <PlanckWalk> But maybe there isn't a better word for what you're trying to express?
[04:13:22] <lizzie> yeah, that is the usage.  THe two local maxima being "male" and "female"
[04:13:26] *** Quits: GvP (~GvP@ip70-162-85-176.ph.ph.cox.net) (Quit: Going offline, see ya!)
[04:13:33] <PlanckWalk> But it obviously isn't?
[04:13:51] <lizzie> the point of referring to gender expression as a bimodal distribution is that it acknowledges that clusters exist, while not treating them as magic categories that everyone should fall into
[04:13:58] <PlanckWalk> Even a microscopic bump elsewhere in distribution space qualifies as having a local maximum.
[04:14:00] <lizzie> PlanckWalk: to many of us, it obviously is, so can you elaborate?
[04:14:10] <lizzie> oh... okay, I see what you're saying
[04:14:20] <PlanckWalk> Even if that bump were 1/10000th of the height of the "main" two.
[04:14:22] <lizzie> I thought bimodal meant that there are two major local maxima that overshadow all other local maxima in magnitude
[04:14:39] <lizzie> either way we're not talking about a mathematical function you can graph, so it's a more colloquial usage of "bimodal"
[04:14:52] <PlanckWalk> Ah okay.
[04:15:14] <lizzie> I didn't come up with that usage.  your criticism might be fair :P
[04:15:38] <PlanckWalk> Well, I was thinking of it as a function you could graph, e.g. plotting various gender-and-sex characteristics in soem multidimensional space.
[04:16:01] <PlanckWalk> I see what you mean now though, so thanks :)
[04:17:18] <PlanckWalk> But yeah, I can't think of a reasonably concise more technical term for "nearly all the mass of the distribution is in two clusters"

[04:51:15] <lizzie> one important point on that topic, I think, is the fact that people in the corporate-political-complex sphere cynically advance ideas about personal responsibility for environmental issues, as a way to distract from regulatory issues that they want to avoid, when the reality is that the regulatory issues have a much bigger impact because corporate activities pollute far more than individuals living 
[04:51:21] <lizzie> their daily lives do
[04:52:44] <lizzie> for example...  movements to get individuals to make decisions about how to transport themselves, will make far less impact than a government regulation improving the environmental impact of that transportation (provided the regulation is actually sensible), or of a government creating good alternative forms of transportation

[08:10:52] <quanticle> I wonder if admitting that you're involved in a cocaine cartel on a video that you're live-streaming to YouTube is such a good idea... but let's face it, on the list of bad ideas that Andrew Lee has gone through with, it probably doesn't even rank in the top ten.

[08:18:11] <gwern> (aha. so *this* is why kara no kyoukai does the anachronic order: at the peak of shiki murdering the protagonist, she's not hit by a speeding car - the villain, who we don't see any of until episode 5, intervenes!

[10:43:50] <quanticle> Didn't Scott write about this in "Radicalizing the Romanceless"?
[10:44:16] <quanticle> Where he had a patient that was depressed, but they were depressed because they had a shit job that didn't pay enough
[10:44:18] <adiabatic> doesn't sound like not getting laid
[10:44:37] <quanticle> And it's like, "What am I supposed to do? He has a good reason for being depressed"
[10:44:39] <adiabatic> oh, sounds like something he wrote about depression just because and having something to be depressed about
[10:46:05] <quanticle> Yeah, it's the intro to Radicalizing the Romanceless
[10:47:28] <capisce> I think depression can be quite situational
[10:47:49] <quanticle> Emphasis on "can", but I agree
[10:54:00] <capisce> maybe in most cases it is, although the kind of situational changes that would be needed to fix it might seem unrealistic

[14:17:56] <feep> or rather, the preconditions create a reasoning engine and then the reasoning engine performs a computation and when that computation evaluates alternatives, fault is created.

[16:05:51] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: "90% of the new sf/f books were SJ-inspired strong-female-protagonist-with-superpowers-gets-revenge-on-the-mean-world"  I've been thinking about writing a story of this type that does a fake out.  The strong female protagonist who is passionate about fighting injustice seeks and finds an artifact that will allow her take on the evils of this world.  The style of writing is cheery and YA at this point.  It could also be a comic with 
[16:05:51] <dbohdan> Tumblr-y superhero art.  She fights whatever mean people she wanted revenge against, and all seems just peachy (if a little morally simplistic).  As she uses the artifact, however, it becomes clear it is something straight out of the Necronomicon that follows its own whims more than her will.  When she tries to stop its increasing carnage, it destroys her.
[16:06:02] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: Your parable is admittedly more subtle
[16:08:18] <mst> dbohdan: stross' The King in Yellow explores something adjacent to that
[16:08:43] <mst> dbohdan: wait, no, thaat's not the title of the novel

[16:10:18] <dbohdan> Thanks!
[16:11:26] <dbohdan> It isn't a very original premise.  Many supervillian origin stories are like this.  The novelty would be in it not being one.
[16:12:21] <dbohdan> And, ideally, in having that characteristic art style
[16:13:15] <rsaarelm> Btw, anyone want to recommend some actually good scifi books from last ten years? For the 00s, I'd have considered Blindsight and Anathem good recommendations.
[16:13:57] <rsaarelm> Recommendations I got from elsewhere were Gideon the Ninth and Memory Called Empire, but I haven't read those yet.
[16:14:08] <mst> I enjoyed both of those
[16:14:38] <mst> also, qntm's sci-fi
[16:14:50] <rsaarelm> Right, that's on my reading list too.
[16:15:03] <rsaarelm> But I'm curious where the "real books" sf is going these days.
[16:15:22] <rsaarelm> As in, initially published in something with an ISBN code.
[16:16:15] <rsaarelm> But I've no idea of a standout book like Blindsight was a standout book in the previous decade.
[16:16:59] <mst> honestly, qntm's There Is No Antimemetics Division fucked with my head as hard as blindsight did
[16:19:13] <rsaarelm> I guess I should get around to figuring out Calibre or something so I can make my own epub out of the web pages.
[16:20:47] <mst> I just bought it on kindle, totally worth it
[16:24:52] <mst> rsaarelm: note that Ra at least has reader created epubs
[16:25:02] <mst> antimemetics division doesn't as yet
[16:25:12] <mst> but there is a paid epub on gumroad
[16:26:48] <Betawolf> Not really the same league as Blindsight etc. but Vandermeer's stuff is in the right window.
[16:27:46] <rsaarelm> Yeah, I have the ra epub on my phone.
[16:28:14] <rsaarelm> Yeah, I've read Vandermeer's Ambergris stuff and liked it a lot.
[16:28:29] <rsaarelm> Should read Annihilation.
[16:28:51] <rsaarelm> It's indeed 2010s, I somehow thought it was older.

[18:35:25] <two2thehead> that too
[18:36:13] <two2thehead> iirc criminology has a 'known theory' (not sure if that is the correct term) about if you were robbed once, you are more likely to be robbed again in a short period of time, ceteris paribus
[18:36:21] <PapuaHardyNet> so the way to easily get paid is to target people who paid money already?
[18:36:28] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm
[18:36:49] <two2thehead> or have made the decision to pay, because they've already gotten used to paying the ransom
[18:38:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder if this applies to other crimes too
[18:38:53] <PapuaHardyNet> rape, for example. I assume someone traumatized would be unable to resist a second time

[18:40:45] <nshepperd2> Well, there's the aspect that paying the ransom directly causes you to be targeted again. And there's also that the reason you were targeted the first time will likely cause you to be targeted again

[18:59:19] <two2thehead> Emil Kirkegaard shows why he is in the top 10, yet again
[19:00:56] <PapuaHardyNet> "Overall, the authors concluded that individuals perceived as more vulnerable to victimiza- tion displayed less synchronous or fluid movement than did those judged as less vulnerable to victimization."
[19:01:06] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting
[19:01:13] <two2thehead> I know, right? :D
[19:01:37] <PapuaHardyNet> that's a correlation, not a cause though, so if one ensures their movement is fluid, doesn't mean they are less vulnerable
[19:01:45] <PapuaHardyNet> however, that does act as a signalling mechanism
[19:01:59] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder why vulnerable people are less synchronous
[19:02:35] <PapuaHardyNet> "Similarly, a more recent study by Sakaguchi and Hasegawa (2006) revealed that men tended to perceive women who walked more slowly and with a shorter stride as more vulnerable to sexual exploitation."
[19:02:38] <PapuaHardyNet> so it is confidence
[19:03:26] <PapuaHardyNet> dominance and confidence makes you look less vulnerable and less appealing as a target

[21:06:46] <dbohdan> nshepperd: A park or carnival at night?  What was the prompt?
[21:06:47] <gwern> such is the sadness of varying aspect ratios... no one wants to do the convoluted programming to make rectangular convolutions or transformer blocks which would handle those directly without padding
[21:07:08] <nshepperd2> "galaxy" minus "galactic"
[21:11:08] <nshepperd2> wonder how i would do that... i'd add padding to expand it to the nearest integer multiple of the vqgan block size, i guess, then have to completely rip out the transformer positional embedding a replace it with something that reflects the aspect ratio properly
[21:12:21] <dbohdan> nshepperd: Try adding "anamorphic widescreen" to the prompt.  Maybe it will stretch it vertically.
[21:14:40] <nshepperd2> i was thinking about those positional embeddings the other day. i think how we normally train transformers might be wrong. normally we have a single array of [batch_size, seq_len] of tokens as input, and expect an array of [batch_size, seq_len, vocab] for logits of the next token as output
[21:16:11] <nshepperd2> this kind of sucks, because it means that the positional embedding pos_emb[i] for each position i has to represent both "the position of the token that is input here" *and* "the position of the token that will be output here"
[21:17:49] <nshepperd2> which is mostly ok for text transformers since there's basically a 1:1 relation between those
[21:18:13] <nshepperd2> but for images there'll be weird discontinuities when you go to the next line
[21:19:21] <nshepperd2> and this might have something to do with why when the vqgan people tested all the more exotic pixel orderings they did worse than plain row-major
[21:21:06] <feep> ahaha

[21:24:59] <nshepperd2> well, my current idea is to split the stuff the transformer processes into two "blocks", "input" and "output"
[21:26:04] <nshepperd2> "input" is for inputting what the transformer has generated so far, it gets position embeddings + tokens as input

[21:51:06] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "Utilizing an American college sample, a cluster analysis was performed on the highest third of Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI)-Total scorers using the Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Personality Inventory‚ÄìRevised (NEO-PI-R) domains. This analysis yielded a two-cluster solution, with one cluster representing Primary psychopathy and the other representing Secondary psychopathy. The two clusters displayed difference
[21:51:06] <two2thehead> s in Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Openness, and Extraversion, which may be important for understanding psychopathy subtyping using general personality traits. Associated traits such as aggression, anxiety, and borderline traits largely match other subtyping research. Overall, the results support the existence of psychopathy variants in a nonoffending sample, the dimensionality of psychopathy, and the ability of normative personality traits to 
[21:51:07] <two2thehead> differentiate psychopathy subtypes."

[23:17:41] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: I meant unusually beautiful in our eyes for their time, per gwern's observation in https://www.gwern.net/Questions#sociology: 'Photographs of exceptionally beautiful women from the 1800s or early 1900s, or nude/erotic paintings from before then, strike most people are being drab and unattractive.'
[23:17:42] <gwern> I'm also interested in just how rare it is for someone from that era to be at all competitive with our own

[23:18:19] <gwern> when you look at the duchess photograph, you don't need to append 'she's pretty good looking... for the 1800s'
[23:19:02] <Urchin[emacs]> one thing that's very different is acceptability of makeup
[23:19:39] <dbohdan> gwern: Wow, I forgot Sharbat Gula was only 12 in the first picture.  Her second picture was taken over 17 years later, though, so it doesn't tell us anything about photoaging in one's teens.
[23:20:00] <gwern> dbohdan: if she's only 12 and she's already that old looking...
[23:20:20] <dbohdan> gwern: Right, but maybe that is nutrition
[23:21:03] <gwern> developmental issues can really throw you for a loop. like in _the great successor_ about north korea, one anecdote is about a foreign teacher who was answering questions from what he thought were middleschoolers because they were so short. they were actually stunted college freshman

[23:31:00] <kuudes> is it just lag?
[23:31:31] <dbohdan> Urchin[emacs]: Was makeup less acceptable?  I know it was less available (even 100 years ago makeup was primitive, with few colors and simple materials like animal fat and vaseline).  Some damaged the skin with long-term use (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_ceruse>).
[23:31:32] <Robomot> Venetian ceruse - Wikipedia (Venetian ceruse, also known as blanc de ceruse de Venise[2] and Spirits of Saturn,[3] was a 16th-century cosmetic used as a skin whitener. It was in great demand and considered the best available at that time. It is similar to the regular ceruse, although it was marketed as better, more exclusive and expensive than the regular ceruse variant.[ ‚Ä¶)

[23:40:12] <Urchin[emacs]> gwern: regarding BJJ question, wrestling type martial arts tend to reach maximum significance in contexts where either weapons are absent, or armor is abundant, and the west had a few century phase where neither of those was true, so it was kind of forgotten, until unarmed competitions become popular again; boxing skews the picture as padded gloves change the primary targets of a punch, enabling focus on hitting bony structures (head
[23:40:12] <Urchin[emacs]> mostly), which would be avoided with unpadded fists
[23:42:20] <dbohdan> Urchin[emacs]: I see.  I was going to ask if you meant in the Victorian era.  I don't know anything about their makeup specifically, but it does match their general attitude.  I wonder when the attitude changed, because there is no way Venetian ceruse was deniable.
[23:44:38] <dbohdan> FWIW, when it comes to photoaging in practice, I try not to leave the house without putting on sunscreen and, usually, a hat.
[23:44:55] <Urchin[emacs]> dbohdan: Venetian ceruse was popular in the 1500s, not 1880s
[23:45:26] <Urchin[emacs]> dbohdan: we're closer to Victorians than they were to the popularity of the Venetian ceruse
