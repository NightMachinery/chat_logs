[04:25:00] <jargon> This is the code isolation.

[04:27:43] <jargon> In the complete project page, it rounds ["evad"] down to zero.
[04:28:58] <maroon> then somewhere in the code it's either being initialized again to zero, or there's another calculation, or another float(0)

[14:46:56] <digitok> would you still like to know
[14:47:04] <dmaislin> Sure!
[14:47:20] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/zjCxom/2
[14:47:32] <dmaislin> My way was in our code function.
[14:47:33] <dmaislin> __e['A'] = __e['_raw'].replace(/\t+/gm,'')
[14:47:33] <dmaislin> __e['B'] = __e['A'].split(/^(?=[A-Za-z -]+:)/gm)
[14:48:22] <digitok> that works too
[14:48:30] <dmaislin> Very nice digitok!
[14:48:59] <dmaislin> I thought you always needed to [a-zA-z] no?
[14:49:19] <digitok> in yours, you don't need 'm' in the first regex or 'gm' in the second
[14:49:31] <digitok> i added the 'i' flag instead
[14:50:16] <dmaislin> Oh yeah, had to look to the right :)
[14:50:30] <digitok> always look both ways :)
[14:51:12] <dmaislin> I def need gm in the second.  Doesn't work without it.
[14:51:27] <dmaislin> well just m
[14:51:33] <digitok> ah, sorry
[14:51:34] <digitok> yea
[14:51:35] <dmaislin> don't need the g
[14:51:55] <dmaislin> We get so used to gm being set by default it is embedded in my brain :)
