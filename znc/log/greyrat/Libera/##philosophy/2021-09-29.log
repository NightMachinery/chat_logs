[04:38:29] <Delf> pussipupu: Why so quite? You didn't get +q did you?
[04:38:46] <Delf> Never mind that!
[04:40:22] <I_Am_M00t> hi bosspotato__
[04:40:53] <Delf> A friend of a friend, said that in order for one to have moral, it must be based off of the opinions of others rather that oneself. Thoughts on it?
[04:45:25] <Ungwelian> Sounds like bullshit :)
[04:46:08] <Ungwelian> You can have a corrupted general populace, with few people with a straight spine.
[04:46:54] <Delf> Indeed
[04:47:18] <Ungwelian> Modern colonialism would be a good example.
[04:47:57] <Delf> This is why it becomes impossible for me to ensure the proper direction for society in democracy.
[04:48:27] <Ungwelian> Yeah. Democracy is imo an obsolete form of government.
[04:48:41] <Ungwelian> Meritocracy would be far better.
[04:49:18] <Ungwelian> Combined with an oversight board consisting of human rights groups.
[04:49:35] <Delf> I do not know what the power structure of Meritocracy is like
[04:49:50] <Ungwelian> Basically it's just government as profession.
[04:50:00] <Delf> Damn right...
[04:50:23] <Ungwelian> The danger in that is an inflated class of bureaucrats.
[04:50:25] <Delf> This can be good or it can be much worse than this, it all depends on the values of the system.
[04:50:31] <Ungwelian> Yeah.
[04:50:50] <Delf> So we're back to dictatorship again, with me as the leader :)
[04:51:14] <Ungwelian> I like to think the oversight board & scientific basis for decisionmaking would curtail the worst parts of bureaucracy.
[04:51:43] <Ungwelian> But of course, anything can be corrupted.
[04:51:55] <Ungwelian> Science certainly for one.
[04:52:41] <Delf> There is solution for corruption as well
[04:52:48] <Ungwelian> The guillotine!
[04:53:23] <Ungwelian> & the Inquisition !
[04:54:18] <vaquero> yeah i feel like democracy isnt the solution we were hoping for
[04:54:58] <Delf> No... enhancing our orientation (environment) and interface (to our environment and each other) capabilities.
[04:56:23] <Delf> Nature or whatever you want to call it... has gotten us this far, it's time for us to take it from here and define ourselves rather than be defined by our flawed designs and limitations.
[04:56:51] <Ungwelian> Sounds like transhumanism :)
[04:57:15] <vaquero> yeah im going the other route, i want to go back lol
[04:57:23] <vaquero> home steading and away from the city
[04:58:04] <Ungwelian> Zerzan writes quite a bit about artificial environments.
[04:58:17] <Delf> Ungwelian: Almost. Guided evolution rather than relying on external tech. It's better to have the tech "on-board", so to speak. Integrated, genetically.
[04:58:33] <Ungwelian> And how they are increasing alienation from nature.
[04:58:59] <Ungwelian> Genetic engineering?
[04:59:38] <Delf> Yes
[04:59:46] <Ungwelian> The problem with that is that genes can only take you so far. I mean, they're a part of hardware.
[04:59:54] <Ungwelian> But on top of that you need software.
[05:00:00] <Ungwelian> Social engineering.
[05:00:05] <vaquero> theres also the trial and error to get to this transhumanist dream
[05:00:13] <Delf> Can you elaborate?
[05:00:32] <vaquero> going to need guinea pigs to trial the tech
[05:00:32] <Ungwelian> vaquero or me?
[05:00:34] <Delf> It's an evolved species capable of self-defining
[05:00:49] <Delf> You, Ungwelian, always been you :P
[05:00:53] <Ungwelian> :D

[05:01:13] <vaquero> its fine me and dude12312414  will go be gay somewhere else
[05:01:20] <Delf> vaquero: Don't worry mate, I'd include you into my collective
[05:01:54] <vaquero> i feel like thats the real dream. be included in someone elses success
[05:02:00] <dude12312414> i don't remember having a date, but i'll take it?
[05:02:05] <Ungwelian> Well. Let's say for example you identify some gene that can be tuned to increase the base amount of neurotransmitters.
[05:02:06] <vaquero> imagine being logan pauls best friend and now gettting to be a millionaire just cause you knew a dude
[05:02:16] <Ungwelian> That would make people capable of faster thought.
[05:02:34] <Ungwelian> However, it could also mean increased amounts of schizophrenia and forms of errant thought.
[05:02:52] <vaquero> Ungwelian:  could tap into ancient monkey genetics, make some super soldiers
[05:03:02] <Ungwelian> When you take this into the social aspect, you'd get both good and evil intelligent people.
[05:03:39] <Delf> That's all good, as long as every person is both
[05:04:02] <Delf> It's far worse when you have people who are only evil and people who are only good
[05:04:11] <Ungwelian> Then there's empathy. I guess the capability for it could be tuned with genetics. Here too, you'd need proper upbringing.
[05:04:27] <Ungwelian> Empathy can make people empathize with all kinds of wrong things.
[05:04:53] <Delf> It is not upbringing that taught me empathy
[05:05:02] <Ungwelian> What did?
[05:05:30] <Delf> Fluid sense of self, identity based off familiar individuals, considered to be part of me
[05:05:46] <Ungwelian> Your family and willingness to learn?
[05:06:00] <Delf> Anyone or anything
[05:06:23] <Ungwelian> Open-mindedness is a good trait. As long as it's combined with moral fortitude.
[05:06:37] <Delf> I have no morals, just sound values :D
[05:06:43] <Ungwelian> :)
[05:07:29] <Delf> Empathy is a subsystem of our orientation capabilities. To navigate our environment
[05:08:10] <Delf> A simulation of the perceived emotions of others
[05:08:44] <vaquero> that would explain why so many people look to the tv to be told how to feel
[05:09:00] <Delf> I used to cry from pain when my mom waxed her legs
[05:09:37] <Ungwelian> Inform her that leg hair is important for proper evaporation of excess bodily fluids.
[05:09:58] <Delf> I'm not on talking terms with her anymore :P
[05:10:05] <Delf> This was when I was around 3 years old
[05:10:15] <Ungwelian> The capillary effect makes moisture rise up the hairs, vastly increasing evaporation surface.
[05:10:17] <Ungwelian> Hmh.
[05:10:42] <vaquero> Delf:  why did it make you cry tho
[05:11:04] <vaquero> i was watching a thing the other day about kids learning how to respond from there parents. did your mum cry when she waxed her legs?
[05:11:22] <Delf> No, she just said outch
[05:11:38] <Delf> It wasn't all that bad for her, it was far worse for me

[05:12:13] <vaquero> the thing was talking about insects and how when kids first discover an insect they will look to there parents to know how to respond and if the mother freaks out over a cockroach the child will learn to have that response
[05:12:50] <Delf> Reproducing behavior
[05:13:19] <Delf> Ungwelian: I'm not pro waxing, don't worry
[05:13:28] <Delf> A little fur is nice
[05:15:16] <Delf> vaquero: It made me cry because I felt too much pain, like feeling stabbed in the heart
[05:15:34] <vaquero> do you have add or adhd?
[05:15:53] <Delf> I don't know
[05:17:43] <vaquero> when i was a kid i use to freak out going out cause i would get overwhelmed by emotions and my psychologist said its cause i was to empathetic, i couldnt block out other peoples feelings around me and id get overwhelmed.  im pretty sure that was a result of my add
[05:17:49] <Delf> Empathy is not necessary but it's a good start
[05:18:23] <vaquero> its a good start if you understand it, when your a kid its pretty shit cause it doesnt make any sense
[05:18:54] <Delf> It should not need to make sense, at that time
[05:19:39] <Ungwelian> Delf, could you make peace with your mom?
[05:19:46] <Delf> I got devastated as a kid when I was told that meat is animals
[05:20:10] <vaquero> im guessing your vegan now?
[05:20:55] <Delf> I'm not at war with my mom, Ungwelian, thanks for asking. But I also do not perceive her as my mother. Merely my biological mother. She lacks the virtues associated with that of a mother.
[05:21:12] <Delf> No, I'm not vegan
[05:22:06] <Delf> Lets not get off tack now!
[05:22:14] <Delf> The goal is to evolve humans
[05:22:33] <vaquero> right genetically modified humans that we eventually will war with
[05:23:07] <Delf> How did you arrive to that conclusion? I will not be experimenting on others first
[05:23:40] <vaquero> already the vaccinated are talking about removal of the unvaccinated, you really think the same behavior wont pop up in "superior" humans?
[05:23:53] <Delf> The purpose is to enable, not to give them weapons and more needs to devour each other or others.
[05:24:51] <Delf> I'm already superior, in a sense. I'm still benevolent.
[05:27:33] <Delf> Empower people so that they no longer depend on others. So that they can evolve, in the direction that they deem suitable for them

[05:42:45] <vaquero> time to do DMT intravenously until my brain turns into brain 2.0 and my consciousness can exist removed from my body

[05:44:17] <Delf> Treat the fellow as your best friend
[05:46:44] <vaquero> you should do magic mushrooms. imagine your perception as layers of filters that you can actively experience one by one being removed allowing your brain to operate unfettered by all the social barriers society has built into your mind.
[05:48:17] <Delf> I've already done drugs mate... Spoiler alert. I had already evolved sufficiently not to get altered in any way after doing drugs. They merely changed my senses, not my sense of self, my judgement remained unclouded.

[05:51:59] <vaquero> Delf:  i made some jokes on another channel and people got upset and told me they hope i die and then i said id pray for them and they got more upset
[05:52:24] <Delf> Think about it. If a person manages to self-define, do you think they would settle for being a parasite rather than independent?
[05:52:46] <amigojapan> Oh hi vaquero
[05:52:59] <vaquero> amigojapan:  hey dude hows it going
[05:53:17] <Delf> They'd settle for being a parasite because it's easier? Then make it TOO easy for them... grant them more capacity so that the latter becomes easy enough
[05:53:22] <amigojapan> vaquero: pretty good, just got up
[05:54:04] <Delf> Good morning
[05:54:18] <amigojapan> Hi Delf
[05:54:40] <vaquero> Delf: depends what you mean by self define, i do think most people are lazy or avoid conflict so will go the easier route of parasite if there is to much uncertainty/fear or just for the convenience
[05:54:46] <biys> vaquero: i have actually followed a lot of JBP
[05:54:58] <biys> and yes i do remember his talk about existential angst
[05:55:10] <biys> i'm actually re watching the JBP vs. Sam Harris debates as we speak
[05:55:31] <Delf> vaquero: Are you pulling my leg now? Are you suggesting that there would be conflict if one does NOT want to be a parasite?
[05:55:40] <biys> which turn into, more or less, the idea of biological determinism vs. free will
[05:56:33] <vaquero> Delf:  im saying if there was to much conflict then people will just go the easier route of parasite
[05:57:28] <Delf> Perhaps that's why the powers that be do a lot to have us at each others' throats.
[06:05:15] <amigojapan> biys: to me it seems that biological determinism is actually chemical determinism and is inescapable
[06:05:57] <biys> amigojapan: there is definitely going to be some kind of attachmet, we'll say, to our genetic history in some regard or another
[06:06:17] <biys> and i don't mean simply something like... fat parents will have fat kids
[06:06:33] <biys> cause there is the possibility that a rose will grow from the concrete (if that makes snese)
[06:07:01] <biys> and that might not necessarily be nature as much as it is nurture
[06:08:38] <amigojapan> biys: I am taking about at the decision making level which is usually given to "free will
[06:08:57] <biys> what i'm saying is something like this...
[06:09:18] <biys> for example... my parents are basic.  my dad is a tradesman and my mom is a SAH mom
[06:09:34] <biys> my mom has maybe a grade 10 education and it took my father multiple times to get his trade ticket
[06:09:39] <vaquero> biys:  you mean like a bonsai, the plant isnt designed to live in a small pot but through nurture you can grow it
[06:09:46] <amigojapan> What is SAH?
[06:10:04] <biys> i grew up with no understanding of money, how to save it, how to make it work for me, amortization, credit cards
[06:10:13] <biys> it wasn't until i met my wife
[06:10:18] <biys> and she showed me these things
[06:10:50] <Inhahe> sah is probably stay at home
[06:10:53] <biys> ^
[06:11:01] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[06:13:35] <biys> it's m ore-so something like...  if my parents are short it is likely i'm going to be short
[06:14:00] <biys> but not necessarily
[06:17:00] <amigojapan> biys: I am thinking more like, if you are standing at a crossroads and are"deciding"to go left it right. It is your brain that makes the actual decision and your brain is an electrochemical machine which is chemically deterministic and can only make a deterministic decision. So eventho it seems to you like you made a decision, that is just an illusion
[06:17:14] <Delf> vaquero: Conflict is alright, as long as we continue to engage with the intention to understand each other
[06:18:36] <vaquero> Delf:  couldnt agree more.  you see it now frequently a complete lack of effort to understand opposing views
[06:18:58] <vaquero> its easy to ignore people that you can just write off as "trolls" or "racist"
[06:19:50] <Delf> vaquero: Those are the devices of disruption at play. Most fall victim to them.
[06:20:32] <vaquero> i remember i shared a video once about pesticides and the related video was a jordan peterson video.  purely for the fact that the related video was JP they immediately discredited the video i linked.
[06:21:44] <amigojapan> vaquero: I guess since atheist people may get offended at "I will pray for you"
[06:21:52] <Delf> Suppose someone is a racist. I prefer not to waste my time because... I can't change their mind? Maybe I shouldn't change their mind. Maybe I should just try to understand their mind and in doing so... they also understand their mind and perhaps they evolve... maybe they come to realize that being a racist is based on an identity that is based on assumptions that we are our genes rather than
[06:21:54] <Delf> the pilots of our drones for example
[06:21:58] <amigojapan> Some but since*
[06:24:34] <vaquero> yeah but now the term racist is used devoid of context as a way to categorize and dismiss. which i think does a disservice. most racism is ignorance not hate, so treating it all as hate is counter productive
[06:27:22] <Delf> Did I just used it devoid of context?
[06:27:43] <vaquero> no i was talking more about the people who use it as a weapon
[06:28:05] <Delf> Ahh, yes yes. Yaa, people have used it as a weapon against me too
[06:28:19] <vaquero> when i worked at a pet store i said to a woman "you wouldnt give a chihuahua great dane food", obviously different dogs have different dietary requirements and her response was "it would be like feeding a chinese person mexican food".  clearly a racist statement but its ignorance so treating it as hate and dismissing her entirely wouldnt educate her or open up a conversation to discuss it
[06:29:14] <Delf> But that does not need to be racist statment mate.. but rather one of cultural difference

[06:31:33] <vaquero> yeah thats my point, treating her as a "racist" would do more harm than good and thats why people need to start acknowledging context again and not allow dipshits on the internet to use these words as blanket attacks to dismiss people

[15:17:03] <mannequin> yu could get it above 95%
[15:17:05] <Maxdamantus> after that, you'd have do use some other process to separate the ethanol from the water.
[15:17:13] <mannequin> but as i told you, it will ignite
[15:17:19] <Maxdamantus> It won't ignite.
[15:17:44] <mannequin> it will
[15:17:52] <mannequin> it will basically blow up
[15:17:58] <Maxdamantus> The flash point is still well above room temperature for pure ethanol. It doesn't change significantly between 95% and 100%.
[15:17:59] <pussipupu> dry ethanol won't spontaneously combust
[15:18:02] <Maxdamantus> and ethanol basically never blows up.,
[15:18:06] <mannequin> so it needs a bit of water in it
[15:18:11] <Maxdamantus> it can only burn at the surface, where it can react with oxygen.
[15:18:16] <mannequin> well it sets itself on fire
[15:18:27] <mannequin> above 95%
[15:18:30] <pussipupu> the limit to distillation is that the boiling points of the constituents equalise
[15:18:45] <Maxdamantus> It doesn't. What you're referring to is the "flash point", which is a particular temperature that you can look up.

[15:19:25] <mannequin> some chick from australia found a good idea to drink that on her 18th bd\
[15:19:29] <mannequin> 3 people dead
[15:19:36] <Maxdamantus> Actually, it's not the flash point. The flash point is just at what temparuter it can burn, which is apparently 14°C.
[15:20:19] <Maxdamantus> In any case, fuel sources don't burn without oxygen and some sort of ignition event.
[15:20:56] <mannequin> yeah you open the bottle up if it was hermetic and it blows up
[15:21:04] <mannequin> that what would happen
[15:21:14] <Maxdamantus> okay, what I was thinking of is the autoignition temperature, which is 365°C.
[15:21:52] <mannequin> ok, then why do you think they make 95% max
[15:21:53] <Maxdamantus> So basically, you would need some sort of industrial oven to make ethanol burn like that.
[15:22:04] <mannequin> because it blows up above theat
[15:22:10] <Maxdamantus> Because it's the maximum you can make through distillation.
[15:22:13] <mannequin> stop spreading bullshit
[15:22:18] <Maxdamantus> Something about an "azeotrope".

[15:22:34] <mannequin> you could go above it but it's way too dangerous
[15:22:38] <Maxdamantus> > Fractional distillation at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to 95.6% by weight (89.5 mole%). This mixture is an azeotrope with a boiling point of 78.1 °C (172.6 °F), and cannot be further purified by distillation.
[15:22:57] <mannequin> yeah wikipedia my ass
[15:23:17] <Maxdamantus> Why do you think it would be particularly more dangerous at 96% than at 95%?
[15:23:40] <mannequin> 95% is the safest point threshold
[15:23:59] *** Joins: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com)
[15:24:00] <mannequin> anything above that is getting hazardous
[15:24:38] <Maxdamantus> 95% is already hazardous. If you buy methylated spirits from the supermarket it'll be about 95% and it'll have some hazard warning on it.
[15:25:03] <Maxdamantus> The reason it's 95% is because it's the maximum you can get through distillation, and there isn't a significant difference between 95% and 100% for most practical purposes.
[15:25:05] <mannequin> there is hazardous and extremly dangerous
[15:25:07] <Maxdamantus> So 95% is good enough.
[15:26:28] <mannequin> well, 95% is strong as hell
[15:27:25] <mannequin> i like drinking it with coca-cola
[15:27:56] <mannequin> a bit of the spirit and the rest is coke

[15:29:04] <mannequin> that kills you
[15:29:13] <mannequin> or at least makes you blind
[15:29:37] <Maxdamantus> Actually in this case it doesn't, because I bought it here in NZ in the last year or so.
[15:29:57] <Maxdamantus> they stopped putting methanol in it here in around 2009 or so.
[15:29:57] <mannequin> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Denaturat.jpg
[15:30:26] <Maxdamantus> in other countries they tend to still put methanol in, so yes, it can make you blind in those countries.
[15:30:32] <mannequin> this label is hilarious
[15:32:21] <Maxdamantus> The main hazards are really just flammability and the fact that you could theoretically get intoxicated from it.
[15:32:57] <Maxdamantus> Though it still tastes very bitter, so it would probably take a lot of willpower to get intoxicated from it.
[15:33:16] <Maxdamantus> I tried a very small diluted amount of it once out of interest.
[15:34:02] <Maxdamantus> probably about 2 ml diluted to 5% (equivalent to beer), and it took about an hour for the taste to go away.
[15:35:49] <Maxdamantus> (again, in NZ they don't put methanol in it—DO NOT that yourself)

[19:46:01] <blkshp> If you travel back in time and kill yourself is it suicide or murder?
[19:47:25] <pussipupu> Definitely murder, it's suicide if you're in the kind of universe where killing your past self also kills your current self
[19:48:06] <blkshp> So it all depends on how time travel would work. In reality, we've just destroyed the universe by a paradox
[19:48:57] <pussipupu> Or caused it to fork, or you were a robot all along with implanted memories
[19:50:02] <blkshp> But only if the robot had been created before the time the past me was shot.
[19:50:39] <blkshp> Otherwise there would be no template to create the robot and therefore no robot but then no killing and the robot created and then no killing and no robot and <BOOM>
[19:51:45] <pussipupu> Well, the memories would have to be recorded before then or be inferred somehow
