[00:49:40] <StayHungry> mdogg: arash: I've never heard the term "not unlikely".... double negation calls for paraphrasing i'd say

[00:52:15] <StayHungry> bin: may i address you privately?
[00:52:19] <arash> StayHungry, so, you mean he wanted to say that negative word two times ? like : not. unlikely ?
[00:53:00] <bin> StayHungry: sure
[00:53:09] <StayHungry> arash: there is a possibility, of course
[00:53:13] <blkshp> arash: please stop putting spaces before punctuation marks.

[00:56:35] <bin> arash: "It's not unlikely that Erin will come for dinner" basically means that it's possible. It's not likely, but it's not unlikely either.

[01:03:50] <mdogg> That's why saying that something is "not unlikely" is strange to me.
[01:05:00] <mdogg> Well, I guess there is a difference.  "Likely" means that there is a greater chance of it being possible.  Saying something is "not unlikely" is more of a 50/50 proposition.  What do you think?
[01:05:06] <bin> No, likely is much stronger than "possible"
[01:05:13] <mdogg> Right.

[03:07:03] <Oleg> I have yet another question about the use of superlative adjectives. In this article https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/nyregion/nyc-vaccine-pass-answers.html , you see this sentence: "Which vaccine app is best?" How come there is no "the" in front of "best" in this case?
[03:09:12] <LjL> hmm... i don't know "why", but "which x is -est" is common. you'd still have to say "the best vaccine app ..." in a statement
[03:09:29] <StayHungry> Oleg: https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/83705/are-there-cases-when-the-word-best-as-an-adjective-could-be-used-without-the
[03:11:08] <LjL> the closest thing on that page looks to be "avocado oil's great for searing meat and has a good amount of vitamin E, while sesame oil is best for low-heat stir fry but doesn't have much in the way of vitamins"
[03:11:43] <LjL> in this case i'd say the reason is that you're not saying that "sesame oil is *the* best [oil]", but you're saying that "sesame good is best *for* something"
[03:12:16] <LjL> but i'm not sure this explains the "which ... -est" construction
[03:16:24] <LuisP18> does feel like the explanation
[03:17:22] <Oleg> StayHungry: okay
[03:19:16] <Samian> I'm writing a review. I need help.  "I saw Dr. Brewer for a vision exam and eye glass prescriptions. He is one of those rare individuals who know and enjoy their field of work so much that they know it in and out."
[03:19:25] <Samian> "in and out" or maybe "through and though"
[03:20:20] <bin> "He is one of those rare individuals who enjoys his field of work so much that he knows it inside and out"
[03:21:28] <Samian> "inside and out, like a walking encyclopedia on the eye" I'll add haha
[03:21:42] <StayHungry> Oleg: try to feel a subtle difference. 'I am best on Fridays' (comparing with different yourself on other days) and 'I am the best on Fridays' (comparing with coworkers).
[03:22:24] <bin> Samian: don't switch up pronouns like you did though it's incongruous

[04:02:36] <Oleg> yeah
[04:03:11] <StayHungry> but there are exceptions in programming languages too, e.g. syntax of JavaScript or Raku/Perl6 is quite natural, words order is sequential if you like. e.g. '23-07-1821'.split('-').reverse().join('-') -> 1821-07-23

[11:56:26] <ash_worksi> okay, it appears I am far too inept to get help in #git
[11:56:35] <ash_worksi> inept at language that is
[11:56:52] <ash_worksi> so I am turning to you, the few, the proud, the linguists
[11:57:27] <ash_worksi> someone in #postgresql said to me they "keep all their migrations"
[11:58:17] <ash_worksi> I ended up blatantly asking a litany of OT questions in #perl about migrations and one was, "do you keep all your migrations?"
[11:59:08] <ash_worksi> one response was (paraphrased), "we keep them in that we can always get them from git, but the files are deleted after they are applied"
[12:00:30] <ash_worksi> which made me think, "do people sometimes say 'keep <files>' to mean use `git` to track them?" --- So I wanted to clarify with the #postgresql person, but I don't have the vocabulary to communicate what I'm trying to say
[12:01:15] <ash_worksi> I think I managed to munge together something comprehensible
[12:02:07] <ash_worksi> but I want to be able to express this concept clearly (ideally without 10 lines of prose)
[12:03:50] <push-f> the whole point of git is that you keep old versions of files after you change or remove them
[12:05:07] <push-f> I don't think you lack the vocabulary ... it's just that both "keep" and "delete" are ambiguous on their own when talking about files in version control
[12:06:06] <push-f> or you could say: when you delete/remove a file in version control you still keep it ... that's the point of the version control
[12:06:21] <ash_worksi> hi push-f , had I realized you were already here, I wouldn't have responded in #git
[12:07:01] <ash_worksi> right, but <see other channel> or I can repost it here
[12:07:46] <ash_worksi> push-f: did you see my response in #git?
[12:07:51] <push-f> yes
[12:08:41] <ash_worksi> okay, right, I am just trying to clarify that when someone says, "keep" they do not simply mean that use "git"
[12:09:52] <push-f> they could mean that
[12:10:21] <push-f> the key point is if they keep the files in the latest revision
[12:10:36] <push-f> which the person in #postgresql said they did
[12:12:08] <ash_worksi> well, #perl was explicit about keeping them in git; #postgresql was ambiguous, but they meant "keep" in the context unrelated to git
[12:12:36] <ash_worksi> (at least, that's what I gathered as I was limping to clarify that)
[12:13:11] <ash_worksi> push-f: ^
[12:13:36] <push-f> I think your clarification was clear
[12:14:24] <push-f> well not quite but the person understood what you wanted to know^^
[12:16:27] <ash_worksi> my next goal was to ask in #sqitch whether people "delete their files, despite them always being available in git commit history" <<< I think that's fairly clear
[12:16:32] <ash_worksi> push-f: right? :\
[12:17:42] <push-f> the git lingo is generally "remove"
[12:17:50] <push-f> because the command is "git rm"
[12:19:09] <ash_worksi> push-f: so perhaps "delete their files, despite them never being removed from git history" <<< better?
[12:19:39] <ash_worksi> do people* delete ...
[12:19:40] <push-f> no that's the most confusing you have written yet :D

[12:22:10] <paulo_> okay, I have trouble pronouncing the two apart
[12:23:03] <ash_worksi> sleep is 'sl - "E" - p'; slip is pronounced like "rip" but with 'sl' instead of 'r'

[12:24:11] <paulo_> yeah I guess I'll have to consult youtube
[12:24:50] <ash_worksi> paulo_: the only thing I can tell you about sleep and each is that the "e" is pronounced the same way you would say "E" as in the sentence: "it is spelled using the letter 'E'"

[12:25:30] <ash_worksi> slip and itch are not
[12:26:08] <push-f> ash_worksi: to clarify "removing a file" with git usually refers to sth reversible
[12:26:21] <blkshp> I think the hard E is difficult for some accents to pronounce.
[12:26:49] <ash_worksi> well, it's harder to describe what a soft E sounds like over text, imo
[12:26:50] <ash_worksi> :P
[12:27:02] <blkshp> Like if i imagine some eastern European accents pronouncing 'sleep' and 'slip' they could sound the same.
[12:27:14] <ash_worksi> push-f: I am generally not asking if someone is removing a file from git because I don't usually expect anyone to want to do that
[12:27:17] <ash_worksi> ftr
[12:28:18] <ash_worksi> if I am asking if they "keep it in git" I am only using that as a way to clarify whether they care about keeping the file outside of git too (ie not commiting a delete)
[12:28:58] <ash_worksi> I am basically never asking if someone is removing a file from an scm
[12:29:09] <push-f> you are asking about whether or not they keep the file in the latest revision
[12:29:38] <ash_worksi> ^ if that means what I am asking then yes :P but that lingo sounds weird to me
[12:29:52] <ash_worksi> because a "delete" could be a lastest revision in my eyes
[12:29:59] <push-f> I think you are using "outside of git" to refer to the working directory, which also does not mean what you think it means
[12:30:12] <ash_worksi> I guess a "revision" is talking about all tracked files
[12:30:49] <push-f> I am afraid Git is more complicated than you realize ...
[12:31:00] <ash_worksi> oh, I realize it :P
[12:31:02] <push-f> especially since there also is a staging area^^
[12:31:15] <ash_worksi> I am keenly aware of my ignorance
[12:31:56] <ash_worksi> it couldn't slap me harder in the face than "you don't even know how to talk about git"
[12:32:45] <push-f> well to be fair I think most git users don't really understand git ... I don't claim to either^^ just the basics
[12:33:34] <ash_worksi> really I should probably have asked the question in a different channel; or have come here first. I think the best way to clarify what I mean is an explicitly *non-git* related term that makes it very clear the context is unrealted to git
[12:33:49] <ash_worksi> blkshp: feel free to jump in here any time ;)
[12:34:14] <blkshp> I'm not reading. Summarise
[12:34:45] <push-f> you manage to confuse me again and again^^ why do you want a non-git related term to ask a question about git?^^
[12:35:01] <ash_worksi> blkshp: someone said they 'keep' their migrations, and someone else said they "keep" them as in they are always in git... I wanted to clarify the term "keep" in the first context
[12:35:18] <ash_worksi> push-f: because it's not about git
[12:35:24] <blkshp> I have absolutely no idea what you're talkin about xD

[12:35:45] <ash_worksi> that was as concise as I felt I could make it
[12:35:59] <push-f> ash_worksi: right you can talk about it in terms of a version control system
[12:36:01] <blkshp> keep what migrations, in what context, in relation to what?!

[12:36:52] <ash_worksi> blkshp: #postgresql person said they "keep all their migrations"; I asked #perl person if they keep them, they responded "I do, as-in they are always in git"(sic); how would you ask #postgresql person if they meant what #perl person said?
[12:37:14] <huf> do you mean you keep them in version control or do you just keep them in the pantry?
[12:37:19] <huf> like that, for example.
[12:37:20] <blkshp> I don't know what "keep all their migrations" is supposed to mean in anyway.
[12:37:28] <ash_worksi> "in the pantry"?
[12:37:38] <huf> blkshp: scripts/files/whatever that apply changes to the database, usually
[12:37:51] <huf> you have to apply them in order, ideally you can roll back between versions
[12:38:01] <huf> and there has to be some sane system for making sure they are only applied once
[12:38:02] <ash_worksi> blkshp: ^
[12:38:18] * blkshp will step back from this because 1. headache, 2. working, 3. has no idea how that sort of stuff works.
[12:38:30] <huf> ash_worksi: yeah, in the kitchen
[12:38:43] <huf> to be honest, I dont understand the situation where you'd say you keep your migrations
[12:38:48] <huf> what kind of idiot throws them away?
[12:38:51] <ash_worksi> blkshp: really, the meaning of "migration" doens't matter... it's just a file
[12:39:05] <blkshp> end of line
[12:39:11] <huf> the entire point of having migrations instead of just ad-hoc fucking with the db by hand
[12:39:14] <huf> is to be able to keep them
[12:39:44] <ash_worksi> huf: well, I have basically spent all day hearing the opposite
[12:40:14] <huf> what
[12:40:17] <ash_worksi> huf: basically, the approach is: (1) create migration (2) test (3) apply (4) dump -> commit (5) trash migration
[12:40:33] <huf> but then how do you roll back and forward?
[12:40:38] <huf> how do the other devs apply the migration?
[12:40:44] <ash_worksi> you have new migrations
[12:40:54] <huf> are they expected to just throw away their old tables and recreate them?
[12:40:56] <ash_worksi> a revert is just the deploy of another migration
[12:40:58] <ash_worksi> always forward moving
[12:41:09] <huf> weird shit.

[12:54:18] <ash_worksi> why not try to design your migrations around the current schema
[12:54:38] <push-f> why would you?
[12:55:03] <ash_worksi> because otherwise you're designing around bad data; and the database is always forward-moving by nature

[12:56:12] <push-f> the assumption is that you have users using different versions of your schema
[12:56:51] <push-f> as you say the schema is forward-moving so migrations also are
[12:59:12] <ash_worksi> which is necessary because of how versions of distributed applications using the db understand how to communicate with it; ie if you release app_v3 to a customer, then app_v3 might interact with a `users` table; when you release app_v5, it might expect to interact with the same data but renamed as `customers`, because the app is distributed to parties outside your control, you must maintain both 
[12:59:18] <ash_worksi> versions; --- is that right?

[13:03:32] <ash_worksi> push-f: but this seems like a more specific scenario -- is there an "in house" reason to hang on to migrations (if you can just check them out anyway?)
[13:03:59] <push-f> in-house as in within a development team excluding deployments?
[13:04:17] <ash_worksi> push-f: including deployments, just not representing 3rd parties
[13:05:25] <push-f> if you maintain only a few deployments you can probably always just apply the latest migration
[13:05:53] <push-f> but the point is that there is a well-established best practice that scales to distributed deployments
[13:06:04] <ash_worksi> huf: you seemed pretty excited about the topic of rolling back. Is there a scenario in which you needed to roll back to some database state that was more than 1 revision old?
[13:06:28] <ash_worksi> huf: I'm guessing some flaw that wasn't caught perhaps
[13:06:33] <push-f> and there is literally no drawback to keeping all migrations in the latest VCS revision

[13:08:12] <huf> ash_worksi: yeah, when you're debugging, it really helps if you can recreate the past correctly

[13:09:44] <ash_worksi> I mean, I have used our schema files fairly often and they are not only out of date, they can't even be slurped into a db to produce a latest schema
[13:10:35] <ash_worksi> huf: in my mind, if you're not considering 3rd parties, then that is easiest using actual separate database instances/servers. Each would have it's own "latest schema"

Described by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, it was for many years considered to be the same species as the Australian boobook of mainland Australia until 1999. Its name is derived from its two-tone c <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morepork>...

[20:08:01] <wstrnr> in Russian and all the related languages "televisor" is a commonly used word that means "TV set"
[20:08:29] <wstrnr> synonym of that is "zomboyashchik"
[20:08:42] <LuisP14> it seems dated as an english word
[20:09:00] <StayHungry> wstrnr: it's not a synonym, but a derogatory term
[20:09:24] <LuisP14> but my use was just being spanglish :p
[20:09:36] <wstrnr> it shouldn't be considered derogatory if it is closer to the truth, just less euphemistic
[20:10:29] <wstrnr> it's like calling a penis "3 meter pole" and then calling a synonym "2 meter pole" derogatory
[20:12:16] <StayHungry> wstrnr: televisor is an apparatus to receive a signal, whereas 'zomboyashchik' is a derogatory term primarily used by few youngsters to express their attitude about the receiving content.
[20:14:12] <StayHungry> wstrnr: that 'truth' of yours is subjective, whereas televisor is an object that is a product of scientific and engineering efforts. here lies the difference.

[20:18:28] <wstrnr> i don't know, i really like this pronoun, especially when it's written with special effects, *they*, Them, or in some other special emphatic manner
[20:18:58] <wstrnr> i think it's use should be promoted
[20:21:05] <wstrnr> the word allows people to at least feel that they agree about the idea of common enemy, it unites people
[20:22:51] <StayHungry> wstrnr: 'zomboyashchik' is basically a way to say 'apparatus that makes zombies out of viewers', which not so much reflects the position of the speaker as expresses disrespect for the majority.

[20:30:00] <wstrnr> ok. i've been reading an article about arguments of flat-earthers recently, and it turns out that flat-earth theorists typically do not agree with each other about what exactly their common belief is, actually they advocate a lot of conspiracy theories, mostly sad and anti-social ones
[20:30:17] <huf> well, duh
[20:31:33] <wstrnr> my personal belief is, when a bunch of people is commonly using "they" in their arguments, the people just understand each other, they know what they are talking about, or at least feel that mutual understanding

[20:34:21] <StayHungry> wstrnr: of course, each stratum of society has own slang. criminals, for example. 'zomboyashchik' refers to youngsters who believe that TV content hides 'truth' from their parents.
[20:35:02] <wstrnr> why are you always saying "youngsters"?
[20:35:34] <StayHungry> wstrnr: i could say hipsters, if you like. it is meant to point to both age and lifestyle.
[20:35:36] <kurahaupo> I contend that the beliefs of conspiracy theorists do not meet the definition of a theory, because they make no (statistically significant) predictions and therefore are not falsifiable. They're faith, not truth.
[20:36:06] <wstrnr> from my experience, this word is mostly used by people at least a generation older than the age group that can be called "youngsters"
[20:36:29] <wstrnr> for example, Anatoliy Sharij, Tatiana Montyan, etc. 40-50 year olds

[20:37:24] <StayHungry> wstrnr: also, i don't judge whether one should use that word or not, not to mention i see no reason to speak about 'truth' here as it relates more to politics than to language. but what you do here is trying to make equate objective definition of word with your subjective perception of it.
[20:37:43] <pussipupu> Though I also contend that it's an annoying trend currently to call any unjustified belief a conspiracy theory

[20:39:20] <kurahaupo> It's a fine line between "unjustified" (without proof) and "disproven"
[20:40:08] <pussipupu> True, but even a broadly disproven belief isn't necessarily a conspiracy theory
[20:40:08] <LjL> pussipupu, especially when no conspiracy is stated to exist. "lab leak hypothesis" = "conspiracy theory", wut? where's the conspiracy, the *theory* is literally saying it was accidental
