[01:14:20] <Samian> Bertrand Russel
[01:14:21] <Parf> an essay on human understanding
[01:14:22] <Parf> right?
[01:14:22] <Samian> Wittgenstein
[01:14:30] <Samian> Parf  yeah that's what he wrote

[01:14:45] <Parf> he built a ladder
[01:15:05] <Parf> the tractatus was probably the end all be all for me, i didn't need to go scrounging around after that in the well of philosophy
[01:15:09] <Samian> I thought bertrand russel created the "tripartite theory of knowledge" and the "gettier problem"

[01:15:13] <Parf> here was a man who had solved everything, some mad diogenes
[01:15:35] <Parf> i heard a story about wittgenstein where he was hanging like a monkey from the ceiling
[01:15:38] <Samian> I thought wittgenstein created the picture theory of language, and the game theory of language
[01:15:42] <Parf> and saying we didn't need to speak in words
[01:15:51] <Samian> Wittenstein likened language to painting a picture and to playing a game.
[01:15:53] <Parf> he was like an ape, and this was how we are to live, like, this
[01:15:56] <Parf> yeah that was later
[01:16:03] <Parf> the tractatus is much more rigorous and insane
[01:16:16] <Parf> most people said his later shit was indeed that,
[01:16:17] <Parf> shit
[01:16:41] <Samian> What by WIttgenstein is shit?
[01:17:48] <Samian> perf what about Kant? Wasn't his major contribution the idea of "synthetic apropri knowledge" ?
[01:17:52] <Parf> the blue and red book, i haven't read them, just assumed the conventional understanding of it was right. it's shit in comparison, one is an attempt to genuinely describe some of the fundamental aspects of building a working theory of rationality and cognition, generally, attempting to transcend thought in a sort of mechanically derived urtext from a lay perspective,
[01:18:16] <Parf> then he slowly derives these word game descriptions afterwards that pall in comparison
[01:18:28] <Parf> it was shit by comparison, the man is a genius both ways, as far as i'm concerned

[01:19:38] <Samian> I think maybe the subject is complete? Maybe there's nothing more or new to be added to philosophy
[01:19:41] <Parf> always,
[01:19:43] <Parf> every day
[01:20:02] <Samian> Example?
[01:20:04] <Parf> i think there are plenty of fields of thought in terms of philosophy that can be helpful in dealing with newfound physics, quantum states and things,
[01:20:28] <Samian> example?
[01:20:29] <Parf> all of this is very hard, and it's a good solace to have philosophers to try to grind it down into narrative driven, meaning-holding digits
[01:21:24] <Parf> i'd give myself as one, since i think it's a living field, but i think some of the people who were formerly woo must be taken into account, and their names these days, are so numerous, i can't even tell anymore. it's all fused together, to me, mechanics and physics, computation, machine learning, it all seems to become a conglomerate structure
[01:21:36] <Parf> willing and capable of holding a sort of omni-philosophy
[01:21:39] <Samian> I see philosophy as a set of foundational tools and ideas upon which everything else layered on top
[01:21:58] <Parf> no, philosophy is a tireless, ever living art
[01:22:03] <Parf> current and vital, no less
[01:22:15] <Parf> a vigil to the rationality of our actions both in retrospect and in the future
[01:22:24] <Parf> philosophy is in essence, a timeless conversation
[01:23:11] <Parf> but yeah, i agree that the big stuff has been built theoretically already,
[01:23:35] <Parf> though now it seems like we can watch as some old thoughts play themselves out, some thoughts were so big they were too heady for our entire race
[01:23:48] <Parf> we had to digest it, through many many many men's minds, instead of one lone wolf
[01:24:14] <Samian> think about it. A scientist conducts experiments to gather evidence. The evidence is studied to see what meaning, inferences, insights can be drawn.  If the scientist has a solid ground in philosophy, the scientist will be aware of the assumptions and foundational chain of logic used: That the evidence is gathered through the senses, that there's an assumption across the time domain made via induction that if I perform an experiment, today,
[01:24:15] <Samian>  tomorrow, next week, and next year, that the outcomes later will be the same based on them previously always being the same.
[01:24:16] <Parf> you think you're separate, you and me, samian? i doubt it

[01:25:13] <Parf> you're thinking strictly classically, but that's fine, you'll figure it out soon enough
[01:26:12] <Parf> really, it seems like there is an end all be all connection between everything, but it's definitely not local and foundational,
[01:26:41] <Samian> The maybe scientist will be aware that the scientist doesn't know if this is all a virtual reality system, and that therefore the experiment and its outcome  does not change that possibility. Maybe the scientist will realize that all that separates the scientist from the philosopher is that the scientist engages more in the evidence gathering process via experiments and observing outcomes.
[01:27:18] <Parf> yes, i'd say the philosopher is more interested in the patterns themselves
[01:27:37] <Parf> how to use them, to relate them, give them identities
[01:27:46] <Samian> logic hasn't changed in hundreds of years.
[01:28:02] <Parf> you really think it hasn't gone through fundamental shifts?
[01:28:06] <Samian> epistemology hasn't changed in the last 50 years I don't think
[01:28:10] <Parf> what do you mean by logic anyway

[01:32:08] <Parf> namely non-contradiction
[01:32:22] <Parf> i don't think it's correct
[01:33:40] <Samian> Parf  if you look at philosophy like a learning addition and subtraction, and look at things that rest on top of philsophy as algebra and calculus, then why not say philosophy is complete and done? How can you say there's more to be discovered? That's like saying there is more to addition and subtraction to be discovered. Yes there is more to be discovered, but it's to addition and subtraction but to the subjects even more advanced than

[01:35:13] <Samian> I think anything more to be added will be considered an additional to another subject
[01:35:32] <Samian> just as a new discovery and math will likely  not be seen as extending the subject of addition and subtraction

[03:14:03] <Parf> i know you want the disruption over :P
[03:14:17] <Parf> so i'm opening the field to them for more salient philosophical discussion
[03:14:47] <tinwhiskers> that's a bit of a disingenuous thing to do
[03:15:12] <Parf> what is? to stop when it's been requested of me?
[03:16:00] <tinwhiskers> good discussions arise naturally and forcing a topic rarely works well.
[03:16:25] <tinwhiskers> I see an ulterior motive but maybe I won't go into it
[03:16:28] <Parf> fair enough, we'll wait for it to arise from pure inspiration, void it out entirely until the first particles
[03:16:37] <Parf> oh you think i have an ulterior motive!

[03:19:35] <Parf> i have many interests of that nature as well
[03:19:48] <Parf> have you seen the neurophotonic results they've been having lately?

[03:20:14] <tinwhiskers> most people here just seem to get bogged down in an argument over whether free will exist or not so I don't tend to both much any more.
[03:20:21] <tinwhiskers> *bother
[03:20:43] <Parf> there was one article recently i read about something to do with a dual type of memory storage that has to do with time and identities of others
[03:20:56] <Parf> let me see if i can find it
[03:20:58] <tinwhiskers> Parf: I read something similar recently myself
[03:21:05] <Parf> oh, well i'll stow it
[03:21:12] <Parf> did you see the one about them breaking dna?
[03:21:23] <Parf> how neurons break dna
[03:21:31] <tinwhiskers> not sure what that means so maybe not.
[03:22:02] <Parf> https://scitechdaily.com/brain-cells-snap-open-their-dna-to-make-memories-extent-of-dna-double-strand-breaks-is-surprising-and-concerning/ i think this one was the one i was lookin at
[03:22:02] <ro-bot-o> [url] Brain Cells Snap Open Their DNA To Make Memories – Extent of DNA Double-Strand Breaks Is “Surprising and Concerning” | scitechdaily.com
[03:22:34] <Parf> "surprising and concerning", seems apt for something as incredible as actively thinking and writing neuronal data
[03:22:52] <Parf> ONTO DNA
[03:23:38] <tinwhiskers> it's not altering the DNA or "writing" toit
[03:23:53] <tinwhiskers> it's breaking the DNA only to "read" stuff
[03:24:02] <Parf> you sure about that
[03:24:12] <tinwhiskers> Well, I only glanced at the paper, but yeah
[03:24:32] <Parf> "The creation of a fear memory doubled the number of DSBs among neurons in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, affecting more than 300 genes in each region. Among 206 affected genes common to both regions, the researchers then looked at what those genes do. Many were associated with the function of the connections neurons make with each other, called synapses. This makes sense because learning arises when neurons change their connections (a phenomenon
[03:24:32] <Parf> called “synaptic plasticity”) and memories are formed when groups of neurons connect together into ensembles called engrams."
[03:24:40] <Parf> you need to do more than glance and assume
[03:24:51] <tinwhiskers> you need to understand what you're reading :-)

[03:26:16] <Parf> it's saying exactly that, right here, it's saying that "we find transcriptional changes are more strongly associated with DSBs"

[03:28:44] <tinwhiskers> breaking the DNA is a mechanism for speeding up the process only
[03:28:50] <krb> shouldn't misuse the holy word fucking like that
[03:28:54] <Parf> "In the analysis of gene expression, the neuroscientists looked at not only neurons but also non-neuronal brain cells, or glia, and found that they also showed changes in expression of hundreds of genes after fear conditioning. Glia called astrocytes are known to be involved in fear learning, for instance, and they showed significant DSB and gene expression changes after fear conditioning."

[03:30:17] <tinwhiskers> right. that means changes in genes, not DNA, in the same way that epigenetics modifies genes without altering DNA
[03:30:35] <Parf> that's fair enough, i'll agree with you with that distinction, i suppose
[03:30:38] <tinwhiskers> gene *expression* is implied
[03:30:38] <Parf> but it's still crazy
[03:30:43] <tinwhiskers> yeah
[03:30:50] <Parf> regardless, i think it's pretty close to actually that process
[03:31:27] <Parf> like, i wouldn't be surprised if dna info is capable of holding our entire conceptual field and then some, just to run the program
[03:32:03] <tinwhiskers> well this paper suggests no such thing. Quite the opposite, since DNA is not being changed. Memories are not stored in DNA
[03:32:19] <Parf> i don't think it says that at all
[03:32:22] <Parf> i think they are absolutely
[03:32:27] <tinwhiskers> there are some epigenetic effects that we can pass on though, though no memories
[03:32:43] <Parf> nah, they proved that with the holocaust studies
[03:32:51] <tinwhiskers> Well, you're almost certainly wrong.
[03:32:52] <Parf> trauma itself can be genetically recorded
[03:32:56] <tinwhiskers> DNA does not store memories
[03:33:01] <Parf> i doubt that highly
[03:33:13] <tinwhiskers> ok dude
[03:35:12] <tinwhiskers> what this is saying is that although the damage is repaired it's concerning that older people may actually get errors introduced, therefore, yes in that case it could be genetically recorded in those cells (non germline cells) and could cause things like cancer in older people.
[03:35:45] <tinwhiskers> there is no suggestion whatsoever that DNA is utilised in storing memory
[03:35:48] <Parf> yeah i'm off to the actual study right now

[04:00:30] <tinwhiskers> ah yes. indeed they can
[04:00:36] <tinwhiskers> it can
[04:01:19] <tinwhiskers> the epigenetics  (DNA methylation) of that is now fairly well understood. No Changes in DNA sequence though.
[04:01:19] <Parf> i've learned a lot about gene transcription and this whole process in the last few minutes, i agree i was wrong about the storage, but i feel this is even more interesting than what i was thinking anyway
[04:01:43] <tinwhiskers> heritability of epigenetics is really interesting
[04:02:06] <Parf> yeah, that was what was like a bell ringer, it seems like, i guess i never had a distinct enough impression of dna vs genes
[04:02:21] <tinwhiskers> ah. ok.
[04:02:37] <Parf> but regardless, getting such a clear picture of the processes behind the activation of fast acting genes to express specific types of dna is incredible
[04:02:45] <tinwhiskers> it is
[04:02:49] <Parf> it's almost like a really fast library system or something

[19:46:31] <audrey> It's not a very well written article (muddied thinking) but I agree with the sentiment
[19:47:01] <audrey> eventually there is going to be a backlash when a generation of young women traumatized by coercive online sexuality realize what's been done to them
[19:51:07] <audrey> Funny how the optimism of the early Internet has disintegrated.
[19:51:24] <audrey> In the 1990s everyone was talking about the Internet being a "global village" ushering in the "end of history".
[19:51:58] <audrey> Now it's ... "hey guys check my bathtub stream out on Twitch and if you give me $20 I'll write your username on my collarbone in erasable marker"
[19:53:39] <pussipupu> the "end of history" nonsense was, appropriately enough, a fable of the dominant ideology which still claims not to be ideological
[19:55:18] <raincomplex> it's very difficult to predict how things will scale
[19:56:22] <brigand> what will the backlash be?
[20:01:21] <arryana> is there usually a lot of screaming while you drive?
[20:02:03] <arryana> i got given a book which embraces part of that topic, audrey
[20:02:06] <arryana> 'the power'
[20:02:13] <plankers> screams on tape
[20:02:22] <plankers> side 1: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
[20:02:25] <pussipupu> That doesn't seem like an accurate or useful characterisation of "the Internet", there are certainly horribly commodotised things in our current society including things regarding sexuality, but that doesn't seem to me to be particularly or primarily about sex let alone "sex positivity" but more about the tendancy of our society to commodify everything
[20:02:26] <arryana> not helfway through it yet, but i'll let you know if it's a good read when i'm done

[20:10:17] <arryana> my squishy discovered she can push open the windows if she's determined enough about it.
[20:10:49] <arryana> i'd locked her out of the conservatory, as it was too warm in there for her, and opened the conservatory-to-outside doors to cool it off.  so the cat pushes open the bedroom window, strolls to the conservatory, and camps in there.

[21:24:52] <Ungwelian> It's become like a repeating yellow press horror story.
[21:25:53] <Ungwelian> Finland has privatized a lot of its health care. A lot of companies are looking to make a profit.
[21:26:48] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian: maybe the real solution is for their families to try to integrate them into their lives :
[21:26:49] <I_Am_M00t> :P
[21:26:59] <I_Am_M00t> instead of brushing them off like sub-humans
[21:27:02] <Ungwelian> A common sentiment among the people is, that they'll suicide when they get old enough to get by themselves.
[21:27:42] <Ungwelian> Some people do that. However, the legislation again is the problem.
