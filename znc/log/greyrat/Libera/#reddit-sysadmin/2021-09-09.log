[00:31:07] <signofzeta> @Ryu use a VPN that uses UDP encapsulation, like an IPsec one (L2TP or Windows IKEv2), Wireguard, or OpenVPN.  I'm not too familiar with Forticlient yet.
[00:31:49] <catbeard> openvpn access server is nice
[00:31:59] <catbeard> as is pfsense CA VPN tools
[00:32:03] <signofzeta> @Ryu: if you're using FortiClient, make sure it's using the IPsec VPN type, as opposed to the SSL-VPN.  The latter puts your TCP packets inside HTTPS/TCP packets, so it adds more overhead.

[00:33:29] <signofzeta> @Ryu: this might not be a night-and-day difference, but it'll help for sure.

[00:34:26] <JollyRgrs> tbh, not a huge fan of wireguard, however, for android (non-rooted) it allows me to configure DNS where standard VPN won't... so I use wireguard on my phone so I don't have to change server settings every time I leave the house

[11:18:23] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I have a mail enabled security group in O365, that has an e-mail address which people now want to use for a shared mailbox.

[11:19:47] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> oh I actually did document it, cool

[11:42:20] <csws> @Sir Sceptalot, the reality is that two objects can't have the same e-mail address so the only proper solution is to change the e-mail for the group and add it as an alias on that mailbox.

[11:50:01] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> Thanks, that *was* what I was going to do.
[11:50:01] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> "Was", because:
[11:50:01] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> - The powers that be changed their mind and they want a different email address (something stupid long which I hope they'll need to spell out a lot)
[11:50:01] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> - The mail enabled security group is not even used for any "security" purposes. I tried to use it in the past as ACL for other shared mailboxes, but it turns out that doesn't work
[11:50:19] <xe0n> it does, just doesnt work as you'd expect, i.e. auto map
[11:50:45] <xe0n> i have mail enabled security groups with members in it applied as ACLs for mailboxes
[11:51:28] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> So that means you still need to add individual users to that shared mailbox, but you can only add the ones in the security group?
[11:51:46] <csws> you just don't get automapping
[11:51:51] <csws> if users add the shared mailbox they'll get it
[11:51:53] <csws> or use OWA
[11:51:58] <xe0n> i add users to the group, that gives them access to the mailbox
[11:52:29] <xe0n> the group is added to the Send As\Full Access delegations on the mailbox
[11:53:17] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> and then they just need to add the shared mailbox to outlook themselves

[11:58:03] <xe0n> document it?

[12:00:35] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> My point was that it would take me almost as much work to convince them to do it themselves than to just do it myself
