[00:43:14] <mgdm> On CentOS 7 and I think 8 if I hit ctrl-x ctrl-e in bash to edit the current line, it tries to open emacs

[22:22:31] <thardin> you
[22:22:45] <mgdm> I understand that it's a game but I've no idea what kind. I remember some people on twitter suggesting they were going to use it in job interviews, which I took to be a red flag
[22:23:03] <thardin> anyway, how's everyone doing tonight?
[22:23:08] <riv> mgdm, i think some characters run around in a spaceship adn then you have to guess which one killed someone
[22:23:17] <riv> it looks pretty cool but i haven't played it
[22:23:31] <mgdm> riv: oh, that was a real-life thing some people I knew used to do
[22:23:38] <mgdm> thardin: I'm good thanks, you?
[22:24:34] <varjag> mgdm: kill people?
[22:24:46] <c355e3b> Itâ€™s werewolf
[22:24:57] <mgdm> Ah yes, that was it, c355e3b
[22:25:17] <mgdm> varjag: I believe it was pretend, if it was real they covered it up quite well
[22:25:21] <c355e3b> IMO blood on the clock tower or mafia de Cuba is better r
[22:25:58] <c355e3b> The game is popular because it tapped into a big streamer market
