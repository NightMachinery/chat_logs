[13:13:24] <ede> autoplay is one of the top10 diseases in the modern web. i'm still on that temporary profile with say no addons. just yesterday i opened a short youtube video (pretty early in the session, so it was ok) to check something, left before it was overm when i returned a couple of other videos has been running already.
[13:13:59] <ede> i was NOT asked for consent or something, so my settings were still in the cookies. but "proceed to next video" suddenly was on again.
[13:14:31] <fedorafansuper> do you know the issue sometimes pressing enter the tab closes

[13:17:18] <ede> Â»sites was playing another video at the same timeÂ« oh yes, maybe there should be some setting for the number of videos playing at the same time unless explicitely requested, and it should be set to 1, or even better, to 0, which would mean no autoplay at all.
[13:17:57] <ede> one of the few things i loved during the flas days, a simple flash blocker just stopped them all without any additional action.
[13:18:22] <ede> fedorafansuper: you press enter, then the tab closes?
[13:18:32] <fedorafansuper> yeah
[13:18:39] <fedorafansuper> it should make google search
[13:18:45] <fedorafansuper> in the url row
[13:28:18] <ede> where, on the start tab (or which one it ever is where the search appears) or in the url bar?
[13:28:33] <fedorafansuper> ???
[13:28:47] <ede> and does this mean that if you start with 5 tabs you are left with 4 after pressing enter?
[13:28:49] <fedorafansuper> where you put in your url
[13:28:51] <fedorafansuper> www.google.com
[13:28:54] <fedorafansuper> where do you do thata
[13:29:01] <fedorafansuper> you know how browsers work?
[13:29:45] <ede> ah ok. new tabs also have a search field if they didn't change it in the meantime
[13:30:05] <ede> not at all sometimes.
[13:30:07] <fedorafansuper> not that
[13:30:12] <fedorafansuper> not within the site
[13:30:14] <fedorafansuper> nothing there

[14:26:53] <ede> no, mozilla totally left IRC for matrix some years ago already.
[14:27:49] <ede> and i couldn't see a single valid reason to do so, they named a few.
[14:29:05] <ede> irc is 30 years old, IRCv3 is on its way, it's tested, has its known flaws. and there are a lot of different IRCd's with differences (take +mz or +q here which doesn't exist like this on Unreal)
[14:30:05] <ede> but they preferred to switch to another system where after 10 years there still is only a single usable client, which is an Electron one. you know, built on top of Google's Chromium.
[14:30:10] <ede> if that's not ironic.

[16:16:04] <heap> hello, i dont know why but i have firefox running .. latest version ... around 600tabs after restore from crash... the FF is utilizing my hdd by 100% so basicaly its unusable to browse/use ff ... any idea how to debug why drive is eaten and alson 80% cpu?
[16:20:41] <vaio> heap: hi, what OS are you on ?
[16:21:30] <heap> windows 10
[16:23:41] <vaio> and what's the memory usage ?  My first though would be that the OS might be swapping as hell, but it could also be related to website storing offline data and whatnot
[16:23:54] <vaio> or also, could be something totally unrelated ;p
[16:27:44] <Zelouille> heap: Try restarting Firefox in safe-mode: Help > Troubleshoot Modeâ€¦ (or in a terminal: firefox -safe-mode)
[16:31:15] <Zelouille> If you don't see high cpu usage here, it might be a problem with an add-on. So disable extensions manually, restart firefox in normal mode, then re-activate your extensions one by one. 
[16:33:15] <Zelouille> If it is still borked in safe-mode, you might need to reload a previous backup of your session.
[16:37:58] <Cork> also with 600 tabs sessionstore.jsonlz can be quite big, so that might be the problem too
[16:38:17] <fedorafansuper> matrix server
[16:38:21] <fedorafansuper> there are different
[16:39:41] <Zelouille> Cork: My session works fine until ~8k tabs (on linux).
[16:39:57] <Cork> Zelouille: number of tabs doesn't fully matters
[16:40:04] <fedorafansuper> how do you organize it
[16:40:09] <Cork> the session includes browsing history, what urls each tab has been on
[16:40:28] <Cork> so just a single tab can be several megs if it has navigated around a lot
[16:40:51] <Cork> or it can be a newly started tab with not much more then the url
[16:41:17] <fedorafansuper> hmm
[16:41:21] <fedorafansuper> dont you lose the overview
[16:41:29] <Cork> (seeral megs before the compression)
[16:41:50] <Zelouille> You are right, i've tweak some options to not save more than 1 previous page.
[16:44:56] <Zelouille> My session is around 13.5 MB in lz4.
[16:45:10] <fedorafansuper> what is a session just open tabs
[16:45:43] <fedorafansuper> are you guys devs sth or heavy users?
[16:45:57] <fedorafansuper> first of all can you read what i write Cork Zelouille
[16:46:35] <Zelouille> fedorafansuper: i'm using All Tabs Helper extension. It displays tabs vertically, allows to search and remove duplicatesâ€¦
[16:46:58] <fedorafansuper> thanks
[16:48:56] <Cork> fedorafansuper: each tab stors "attributes","entries","extData","formdata","hidden","image","index","lastAccessed","pinned","requestedIndex","searchMode","userContextId"
[16:49:10] <Cork> then there is windows above that and closed windows and tabs around those
[16:49:17] <Cork> plus some additional information
[16:49:22] <Cork> so it becomes quite a lot of things
[16:49:37] <fedorafansuper> you explain why 13.5MB there are some more informations ok
[16:50:10] <Cork> fedorafansuper: you can give the jsonlz4 files to https://github.com/avih/dejsonlz4 and inspect it your self
[16:50:23] <Cork> it is a LOT of junk in there
[16:51:05] <fedorafansuper> ok
[16:52:55] *** Quits: IamKing (~liege@user/iamking) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:53:11] <ede> several megs? iirc most of the past content is forgotten after shutdown, also all the future content.
[16:53:20] *** Joins: IamKing (~liege@user/iamking)
[16:54:27] <ede> also the icons are 150x the size of the session on disk
[16:55:03] <fedorafansuper> i missed the begin of your talk there was someone with a problem ah ok sorry
[16:55:06] <Cork> ede: no, back history and the urls, and there favicon is stored in the session
[16:55:18] <Cork> so that can be quite a lot of data
[16:55:22] <ede> btw, any reason why it mixes json and sqlite?
[16:55:27] <fedorafansuper> but it became interesting do you have an idea i never had luck to have a fast tab browser its always weak
[16:55:34] <Cork> ede: it doesn't
[16:55:39] <ede> 278k here
[16:55:56] <Cork> if you mean why it uses different fileformats, .sqlite is for places mainly, it is a firefox 3 implementation
[16:55:59] <ede> but i have to admit i'm still on my way to close this profile
[16:56:06] <t4nk_freenode> I'm suffering from some issues
[16:56:12] <Cork> the moved to the propriatary jsonlz4 cause of momory usage for sqlite
[16:56:15] <t4nk_freenode> also: I'm having troubles with firefox
[16:56:26] <ede> oh sqlite is that bad?
[16:56:33] <ede> in terms of RAM
[16:56:40] <Cork> ede: compared to a linked list? yes
[16:56:42] <fedorafansuper> 8GB Ram
[16:57:23] <Cork> for a reuqy engine, no, it is quite fine
[16:57:33] <Cork> *query engine
[16:57:55] <fedorafansuper> ahhh i have an idea why does firefox needs a fast gpu sth
[16:58:05] <ede> uh. i remember i needed some time to even look into mysql because i had those concerns. using KDE2, and when i finally started it it was just... nothing. but maybe sqlite is different here
[16:58:29] <ede> like bind? ;)
[16:59:00] <t4nk_freenode> I always compiled with lto/pgo, but since 93.0 that build will fail, will hang indefinitely at some point. So I removed the pgo and enjoyed a shorter compile time. But now after some time I'm having troubles with video sites, videos will not start anymore and at some point firefox becomes unresponsive.. no drawing problems, but clicks are ignored
[16:59:01] <ede> just because i've read that it's a real memory hog because it keeps all the stuff in RAM and there's a lot of data per node.
[16:59:34] <Cork> ede: it is manily the indexes, needed for search
[16:59:50] <Cork> if you don't need them it is much better to not use sqlite
[16:59:53] <t4nk_freenode> I've just started another build with pgo to check
[17:00:02] <Cork> and firefox used to use a lot of sqlite files
[17:01:07] <Cork> (places.sqlite, webappstore.sqlite, sotrage.sqlite, signons.sqlite, permissions.sqlite, kinto.sqlite, favicons.sqlite, cookies.sqlite...)
[17:01:16] <fedorafansuper> are you guys users or do you code stuff for firefox
[17:01:22] <Cork> now days most of those are jsonlz4
[17:02:04] <fedorafansuper> ah its cool

[23:11:58] <nemo> hm. I definitely wouldn't use unsupported versions for anything like finance
[23:12:08] <nemo> but your call
[23:12:54] <nemo> AFAIK they only restrict security related pages from addons
[23:13:00] <superkuh> Nope.
[23:13:02] <nemo> which makes a lot of sense
[23:13:04] <superkuh> The list has expanded.
[23:13:14] <superkuh> And not having a way to turn it off or edit the list is terrible.
[23:13:40] <nemo> superkuh: expanded to what? 
[23:13:42] <superkuh> Try support.mozilla.org
[23:13:48] <superkuh> Go to any page there.
[23:13:54] <superkuh> Your add-ons will be disabled.

[23:14:16] <superkuh> Also the new-tab tab.
[23:14:29] <nemo> yeah. about:* are internal pages. those were always restricted
[23:14:33] <superkuh> Which is a deal breaker. Not being able to mouse gesture out of a new tab is  just.... bad.
[23:14:37] <nemo> addons and support are the only two mozilla.org I'm unaware of
[23:14:42] <nemo> *aware of
[23:14:55] <nemo> superkuh: well... you can rebind it to a url you control I guess
[23:15:01] <nemo> like https://superkuh.org
[23:15:05] <nemo> on new tab
[23:15:13] <nemo> or even file:// I think. but haven't tested that
[23:15:15] <superkuh> Yes. There are ways to mitigate the suck.
[23:15:18] <nemo> hm. I wonder if a data uri would work
[23:15:23] <nemo> superkuh: well. just saying. the reasons make sense
[23:15:23] <superkuh> The best is just using a completely different browser.
[23:15:30] <nemo> I guess you could do your own build to turn off the security features
[23:15:32] <nemo> *shrug*
[23:15:33] <superkuh> But for some websites I need the JS engine that is modern FF.
[23:15:43] <superkuh> I guess I should just stop trying to make it a real browser.
[23:15:56] <superkuh> nemo, I did look into that.
[23:16:05] <superkuh> But I could never find how the actual list of protected pages was implemented.
[23:16:07] <nemo> they have build instructions. I've done it before when debugging
[23:16:08] <superkuh> re: add-ons.
[23:16:11] <nemo> oh?
[23:16:20] <nemo> can't be that hard
[23:16:22] * nemo looks
[23:16:37] <superkuh> You'd think. Maybe I'm just a doofus but I couldn't find it.

[23:19:21] <nemo> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361953
[23:19:27] <nemo> for the discussion of why they did it
[23:19:44] <superkuh> I assume it's to protect the ignorant and be a better browser for commerce.
[23:20:18] <superkuh> Being able to just change this via about:config is pretty nice though. No complaints about it anymore.
[23:37:07] *** Joins: CoJaBo (~aztec@user/CoJaBo)
[23:37:25] <CoJaBo> Have addons for firefox mobile been discontinued or something? 
[23:37:32] <CoJaBo> There are.. 16
[23:45:13] <nemo> CoJaBo: yeah. it's stupid and lame
[23:45:27] <nemo> CoJaBo: they've had on the "todo" to enable more for a long time
[23:45:40] <nemo> CoJaBo: at present the process for getting more addons is to â‘  install nightly (yay for moar ssd wear)
[23:45:46] <nemo> â‘¡ register for a firefox account 
[23:46:03] <nemo> â‘¢ add the addons you wanna trust
[23:46:09] <nemo> it's annoying and I haven't bothered yet
[23:46:32] <nemo> CoJaBo: so I said goodbye to Stylus and uMatrix and Tampermonkey
[23:46:48] <nemo> CoJaBo: DarkMode can be used as a crude Stylus replacement thanks to its custom CSS functionality
[23:46:54] <nemo> NoScript is a primitive uMatrix
[23:47:02] <nemo> no tampermonkey solution yet
[23:47:21] <nemo> CoJaBo: they also don't use bugzilla for mobile firefox, but you can complain about it in the github bugs they close
[23:47:43] <CoJaBo> nemo: What is you don't want a firefox account?
[23:48:01] <nemo> https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/21682
[23:48:08] <nemo> CoJaBo: eh... I'm just lazy
[23:48:16] <nemo> I'm sick of making accounts for mozilla and having them kill them off
[23:48:16] <CoJaBo> nemo: Mainly, I need a way to access Facebook messages; is there a work-around for that that doesn't require a firefox account?
[23:48:28] <nemo> CoJaBo: never heard of facebook messages
[23:48:29] <nemo> what is it
[23:48:51] <nemo> https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/20703
[23:49:18] <CoJaBo> nemo: They block access from mobile user agents, so I need to either force desktop mode, or change the user-agent, for that domain
[23:49:28] <nemo> oh
[23:49:43] <CoJaBo> There's plenty of addons to do both of those things, but apparently you aren't allowed to install them on mobile anymore?
[23:50:04] <nemo> CoJaBo: well. desktop mode works I guess, you can also spoof your user agent string with about:config but that's tedious
[23:50:09] <nemo> desktop mode is less work than that
[23:50:26] <CoJaBo> Is there another browser or maybe fork of firefox that supports addons?
[23:50:39] <nemo> (to actually *access* about:config on mobile you have to install the firefox version from f-droid or use nightly again)
[23:51:02] <CoJaBo> nemo: There's no option to configure desktop mode for a domain
[23:51:03] <nemo> CoJaBo: wouldn't know anything about that apart from the F-Droid one which only adds about:config it seems
[23:51:13] <nemo> CoJaBo: well, you can toggle it on for a tab and just leave that tab on
[23:51:18] <nemo> can't you?
[23:51:34] <nemo> it's not *that* much of a hassle
[23:51:38] <CoJaBo> The problem is the page is a bookmark
[23:51:42] <nemo> ah
[23:51:55] <nemo> CoJaBo: so it's opening in a new tab and you have to whitelist it over and over
[23:52:11] <CoJaBo> Well it's worse than that
[23:52:12] <nemo> CoJaBo: AFAIK the only solution is nightly firefox
[23:52:21] <nemo> CoJaBo: it's irritating but apparently does work
[23:52:28] <nemo> and if you have a firefox accoutn is apparently not too painful to setup
[23:52:30] <CoJaBo> Nightly would be fine, but why would it require an account?
[23:52:41] <nemo> CoJaBo: they link the whitelist to you, individually
[23:52:48] <CoJaBo> If I was ok with that BS, I'd just install chrome lol
[23:52:56] <nemo> I agree it's moronic
[23:53:03] <nemo> people have complained repeatedly to the team
[23:53:13] <nemo> they have this idea that it's better to block and have irritated pro users
[23:53:20] <nemo> then not-block and have users blame them for broken addons
[23:53:23] <CoJaBo> I think I need to switch browsers.. nobody has seriously forked this yet?
[23:53:33] <superkuh> Oh, there have been lots of forks.
[23:53:40] <superkuh> But browsers are operating systems nowadays.
[23:53:49] <superkuh> And keeping a fork going is a very large project.
[23:53:50] <nemo> I was disappointed that the F-Droid one still has these limitations in place
[23:53:52] <nemo> I'm not sure why
[23:54:03] <nemo> only thing they opened up was about:Config - which I do appreciate
[23:54:23] <CoJaBo> Yeh, I can't change the global user-agent, as then there would be no way to access mobile sites ever
[23:54:39] <CoJaBo> It needs to only effect that specific domain
[23:54:47] <nemo> CoJaBo: you could, perhaps, install firefox twice
[23:54:51] <nemo> CoJaBo: install the F-Droid version
[23:54:56] <nemo> change the user agent in *that* version
[23:55:06] <CoJaBo> Man, that's messy :/
[23:55:07] <nemo> CoJaBo: and use the F-Droid firefox for opening facebook stuff
[23:55:20] <nemo> CoJaBo: I do find some utility in this I gotta say
[23:55:30] <nemo> I have regular firefox less locked down than my f-droid one
[23:55:34] <nemo> in part out of necessity
[23:55:42] <nemo> since I can't access about:config to turn stuff off in regular firefox
[23:56:19] <CoJaBo> Does chrome mobile still support addons? or is there a mobile version of chromium lol
[23:56:24] <nemo> no idea
[23:56:32] <nemo> not gonna contribute to that spiraling fail of the web
[23:56:38] <nemo> even if mozilla is disappointing me
[23:57:03] <CoJaBo> It looks like mozilla has already hit bedrock if they're mandating signins. Google is pretty agressive with theirs, but afaik it is still optional
[23:57:28] <nemo> https://nitter.1d4.us/fasterthanlime/status/1452053940024057857  related
[23:57:46] <nemo> CoJaBo: well. it's not mandated for their "approved" list
[23:57:56] <nemo> the crappy part is their "approved" list has stayed uselessly small for a long time
[23:58:01] <nemo> despite their promise to address this
[23:58:06] <nemo> and despite bad press in public places
[23:58:41] <nemo> it's particularly annoying to me there's no about:config toggle even
[23:59:10] <nemo> it's like someone found this awesome control mechanism (the one intended for signing/trust to avoid malicious) and was so enchanted by it they abused it for this user hostile purpose
[23:59:26] <nemo> and that mechanism was deliberately made not-user-overridable since the malicious stuff tends to have that level of access
[23:59:35] <nemo> also for the !@# MS GPO stuff
