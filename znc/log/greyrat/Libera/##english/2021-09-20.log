[00:29:04] <blkshp> We'd call that Jam or maybe conserve
[00:30:02] <TechTest> not jelly?
[00:30:12] <blkshp> Never/
[00:30:30] <TechTest> so the pudding thing is jelly in the UK and jello in the US
[00:31:07] <blkshp> I cannot confirm for the US but I believe that's correct.
[00:31:36] <TechTest> actually don't they call jam "jelly" in the US?
[00:31:45] <blkshp> I believe so
[00:31:55] <TechTest> isn't that what they mean when they say peanut butter jelly sandwich?
[00:32:00] <blkshp> Yes

[00:36:42] <TechTest> chips are the crispy ones
[00:37:11] <TechTest> blkshp: jello is still the pudding thing, so I'm not wrong for calling it jello :P
[00:37:49] <blkshp> Exactly. In the US it's what they call thinly sliced potatos which are fried to a crisp and flavoured, often served from a packet. In the UK they are sticks of potato, fried thickly and served with a main course or on their own.

"Jello" is a rarely seen foreign brand of such. When countable, "a jelly" is short for "a jellyfish", especially a stinging variety.

[13:47:40] <Samian> When I pronounce "fun", the tip of my tongue touches the roof of my mouth to pronounce the "n" sound.  But when I pronounce the "n" in "function", my tongue is in a totally different position.  The back of my tongue is touching the root while the tip is touching the gum below my lower teeth.  
[13:48:14] <furrykef> I believe that's correct behavior

[13:48:27] <furrykef>  /n/ vs. /ŋ/, in IPA

[19:27:47] <hoglahoo> where I live, the pronunciations are usually indistinguishable
[19:27:59] <hoglahoo> sometimes they’ll sound different if the speaker is using particular emphasis
[19:29:18] <GuiToris> thank you, I guess my question doesn't really make sense, Americans don't use liter
[19:30:05] <GuiToris> I thought a guy was mispronouncing it. I used to use a different vowel sound, like the one in the word 'lit'
[19:30:56] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: wouldn't that be "litter" (rubbish)?
[19:31:42] <GuiToris> I've looked it up, exactly like that. Litter is just not in my vocabulary

[19:33:17] <twb> kurahaupo: sounds arhotic
[19:33:27] <kurahaupo> yep. 
[19:33:47] <kurahaupo> non rhotic dialect
[19:34:04] <GuiToris> I suppose this is the only exception where 'i' sounds like 'ee'
[19:34:14] <kurahaupo> which means we focus more on vowel distinctions
[19:35:29] <kurahaupo> GuiToris: it's the same as in "radius"
[19:35:52] <hoglahoo> 2-liters are common products here <GuiToris> thank you, I guess my question doesn't really make sense, Americans don't use liter
[19:36:31] <kurahaupo> well, Americans use liters. The rest of us use litres
[19:36:34] <hoglahoo> I rarely ever hear liter in contexts outside of academia or the beverage container
[19:37:13] <hoglahoo> so even kids are exposed to the word early on
[19:37:22] <GuiToris> kurahaupo, that's interesting, I can't hear the difference in radius, I mean if I pronounce it with the conventional 'i' sound, I hear the very same thing
[19:37:32] <GuiToris> hoglahoo, I didn't know you were from America
[19:38:03] <hoglahoo> makes sense, I don’t know where most people are
[19:38:04] <GuiToris> (referring to your 'here')
[19:39:34] <hoglahoo> I’ve lived in Tulsa, America my whole life
[19:39:49] <GuiToris> do you have '2-liters' products and gallons as well?
[19:39:56] <hoglahoo> and most of my travels have been within the states
[19:40:20] <hoglahoo> yes, both

[19:45:16] <GuiToris> I looked up the climate of Oklahoma, it looks like a warm place
[19:46:16] <hoglahoo> it can be.  western half is desert-ish, eastern half can be muggy and miserable

[19:54:28] <GuiToris> I prefer warm places
[19:54:40] <GuiToris> for me, warm means 25C and above
[19:54:54] <hoglahoo> do you have a few years to wait for global warming to do its job there?
[19:55:01] <pussipupu> There is sadly a lot of irresponsible drinking at lakes, and also infirm people getting into trouble
[19:55:31] <pussipupu> Global warming is going to do a number on the climate here, if we stop getting proper winters the forest ecosystem will be in trouble :/
[19:55:34] <GuiToris> hoglahoo, global warming causes ice age, not tropical weather
[19:55:42] <pussipupu> 25°C is horrid
[19:56:02] <pussipupu> But it's often over that in summer
[19:56:18] <GuiToris> the current temperature is below 25, so I'm using the heating system
[19:56:40] <GuiToris> yeah, I heard, the Finnish summer is short with little snow
[19:57:00] <pussipupu> It's apparently 9°C outside
[19:57:30] <pussipupu> Not sure if you're joking but Finnish summer at least where I am is long and hot and without snow :þ
[19:57:55] <kurahaupo> 25°C is quite nice by my reckoning
[19:58:12] <GuiToris> I was joking, and even though I really want to visit Finland, I find 9C extremely cold

[23:14:33] <GuiToris> do you know how it works? I found one but it says, do not pour boiling water. and read the description
[23:14:48] <GuiToris> I have no idea how warm the water can be
[23:15:00] <GuiToris> it's made of rubber
[23:15:24] <huf> try it with hot water from the tap
[23:15:31] <huf> see how that feels
[23:16:00] <GuiToris> huf, ok, thanks for the hint
[23:16:16] <GuiToris> I would have poured into much warmer water
[23:16:19] <huf> the temperature where it feels good has to be within the operating temperatures
[23:16:26] <huf> and it's cheap and easy to experiment
[23:17:19] <GuiToris> I don't necessarily want to interact with it. my room is cold and I would warm my bed with it

[23:29:39] <GuiToris> LuisP18, yes, but I hoped you could express it in celsius
[23:29:59] <GuiToris> 90 or 50, I really don't know
[23:30:13] <Loshki__> Water at 60 °C (140 °F) can induce scalding injuries in less than 3 seconds, while it takes 10 seconds to get an injury at 57 °C (135 °F) and 1.5 to 2 minutes in 52 °C (126 °F) hot water -- google
[23:31:30] <GuiToris> this is helpful, thank you
[23:31:49] <blkshp> GuiToris: sorry, i dissapeared 
[23:32:00] <GuiToris> disappeared
[23:32:22] <blkshp> Jeez, the sass.
[23:32:33] <GuiToris> I'm acting as if I were that smart
[23:32:34] <blkshp> xD
[23:33:03] <Loshki__> blkshp: I know. I wonder if that's where all those negative ratings you have came from
[23:33:14] <GuiToris> it was only suspicious and I asked my spellcheck, but don't tell anyone
[23:33:28] <GuiToris> there are words that I just can't spell, like embarrassed
[23:33:43] <blkshp> Loshki__: how wude.
[23:33:48] <GuiToris> (I didn't mess it up this time)
[23:34:32] <Loshki__> GuiToris: me too, like unnecessary
[23:34:46] <GuiToris> same
[23:34:54] <GuiToris> I don't feel alone anymore
[23:35:09] <GuiToris> life must have been hard before spellchecks
[23:35:45] <Loshki__> Yeah, but I'm a native speaker/speller, and a grammar Nazi to boot who took Latin in school. I'm *supposed* to know better.
[23:36:24] * blkshp puts Loshki__ in charge of the channel.
[23:36:54] <TechTest> recently I have been using voice to text converters a lot and they very often misunderstand what I'm saying
[23:36:58] <GuiToris> I'm not quite convinced it is easier for you. I read that some native speakers think 'should have' is 'should of' because that's how it sounds
[23:37:03] <TechTest> so that probably means my accent is bad
[23:37:12] <blkshp> Kill them
[23:37:30] <TechTest> *but* same thing happens in greek to which is my first language, so maybe I just don't speak well in general
[23:37:37] * TechTest kills blkshp 
[23:37:48] <TechTest> now we can talk without interruptions
[23:37:56] * blkshp dies x_x
[23:38:35] <GuiToris> hey TechTest, don't kill the hand that feeds you ... umm, feeds me... whatever
[23:38:56] <TechTest> blkshp: if you want me to forgive you, you can test the voice to text converter I'm using and tell me wether it does the same with you
[23:39:31] <GuiToris> TechTest, https://dictation.io ?
[23:40:08] <blkshp> TechTest: Not right now.
[23:40:23] <TechTest> GuiToris: no, not that
[23:40:48] <GuiToris> that's what I use every now and then
[23:41:03] <TechTest> blkshp: ok, you are staying blacklisted until further updates :P
[23:41:04] <GuiToris> but it makes more mistakes than I do
[23:41:17] <TechTest> GuiToris: are you native?
[23:41:24] <GuiToris> native to foreign
[23:41:34] <TechTest> what does that mean?
[23:42:24] <blkshp> It means no.
[23:42:27] <GuiToris> over the course of the years, I realized that every single person is native to some kind of language
[23:43:12] <GuiToris> I'll check it again, but I think I read somewhere that there are people who speak esperanto natively
[23:43:27] <TimMc> I don't think that's true.
[23:43:38] <GuiToris> Native: approximately one thousand or more (2011)
[23:43:38] <LuisM18> lol
[23:43:44] <GuiToris> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto
[23:44:49] <TimMc> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Esperanto_speakers
[23:44:50] <TimMc> hmm
[23:45:19] <GuiToris> haha, it does have a separate page
[23:45:30] <TimMc> « The Esperanto of native-speaking children differs from the standard Esperanto spoken by their parents. »
[23:45:54] <TimMc> The definitions of "native" and "Esperanto" are both a little stretched here.

[23:48:41] <GuiToris> this is the part that lost my attention 'In all known cases, speakers are natively bilingual'
[23:48:58] <GuiToris> I wouldn't say they are native but they can speak esperanto as well
[23:49:19] <GuiToris> I'll look latin up, I'm quite sure there are natives too
[23:50:01] <GuiToris> 'Despite having no native speakers, Latin is still used for a variety of purposes in the contemporary world'
[23:50:16] <GuiToris> it's not a surprise that I was wrong... again
[23:50:21] <Loshki__> GuiToris: I worked with an engineer who spoke broken English. I asked her what her native language was. She said it was supposed to be Mandarin, but that her Mandarin was as bad as her English.
[23:51:09] <jessicara> GuiToris: i have used hot water bottles, are good sometimes
[23:51:25] <jessicara> by not boiling, it means wait for kettle water to cool so it's not like 100c boiling
[23:51:55] <GuiToris> Loshki__, I also met a guy who claimed to be Finnish, and when I requested a simple sentence, he couldn't translate it
[23:52:23] <jessicara> careful pouring it in though, it's like threading a needle but british people seem used to it
[23:52:34] <GuiToris> jessicara, I didn't find much information, one of the description said I should wait for 20 minutes after boiling

[23:56:53] <Loshki__> We used to fill hot water bottles straight from a boiling kettle, then wrap it in a towel before putting it in bed. There is extra rubber at the mouth of the hot water bottle so you can hold it while keeping your fingers away from the water. Still an acquired skill though, I'd say.
