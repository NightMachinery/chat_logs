[00:25:57] <FromGitter> <sebastjan-hribar> Hi All, I've just made a fresh install of 0.300.0@27.2, develop branch. I'm not an experienced user so I can't tackle the 261 Warnings I get after the first run of spacemacs as well as the evil-want-keybinding problem. Can someone help with this?
[00:59:09] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> @sebastjan-hribar:  You can do SPC h d v and type evil-want-keybinding
[00:59:28] <FromGitter> <drpastah:matrix.org> i think it just overwrites keybindings to prefer vim stuff over emacs stuff

[11:09:08] <FromGitter> <sebastjan-hribar> It seems everything runs fine now. I've always used the  master branch with 0.200.x so this is new to me :). But I really want to stay with spacemacs. On that note, if I uncomment git in my conf file I get more errors with messages that packages might be misspelled. Is this a known issue?
[11:21:47] <FromGitter> <milochadam> Packages were renamed (or rather, merged into a new one).  ‚èé I think I added  `(compat :location (recipe :fetcher github :repo "phikal/compat.el"))`to `dotspacemacs-additional-packages` but it's my workaround and I don't know what's the recommended approach

[13:23:41] <FromGitter> <jtweigle> Hi, I recently moved to spacemacs from evil-mode. In org-mode, is there a more convenient (no holding keys down) key sequence than C-c C-e for showing the export menu? If not, what‚Äôs a good way to make one?
[14:43:18] *** Quits: fahrradToken (~fahrradTo@2a02:810b:149f:f0f4::1ac8) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:24:11] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> I am trying to use shell inside the spacemacs, and regardless if I use ansi or vterm, I can't figure out how to get easy access to previous commands from the history (what you would normally do with arrows up and down in external terminal). ‚èé I saw in the docs that the keybindings are C-j and C-k which sounds great, but it doesn't work for me. I am using evil mode. C-j has the same effect as pressing Enter 
[15:24:11] <FromGitter> ... (same like in external terminal), and C-k does nothing. ‚èé What am I doing wrong, are there some other keybindings? which-key doesn't seem to work for me in the emacs terminal.
[15:24:52] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> Btw M-r works after I defined that config variable which points to the .bash_history file.
[15:33:32] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> @Martinsos try C-p and C-n
[15:38:10] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> Actually, it is M-p and M-n!
[15:38:21] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> @fran-penedo that means the docs are incorrect?
[15:40:21] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> hmm, not sure how I got them bound to C-p and C-n then. Don't trust the docs too much, they're sometimes out of date or incomplete
[15:40:41] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> C-n is evil-paste-pop-next while C-p is evil-paste-pop
[15:41:03] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> any recommendation on how to override these keys, where would you put it in the config?
[15:43:04] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> I guess in dotspacemacs/user-config, I should do (use-package shell :bind (:map <smth> ("<keys>" . function)))?
[15:46:37] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> hmm as far as I can see those binds are not in spacemacs by default, so something in your config might be messing them up
[15:48:16] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> also I'm pretty sure you shouldn't be using `use-package` in your config unless you really know what you're doing
[15:48:52] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> Aha hm! Well I have very little custom stuff and I can't imagine any of that having such effect hm. ‚èé How did you check default binds?
[15:50:34] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> `shell` is a layer you can add in `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers`, and binds are defined in `spacemacs/user-config` with `(define-key [map] [key] [command])`
[15:51:07] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> I am looking at https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/layers/%2Btools/shell/funcs.el#L190-#L194 right now and from what I see, they try to set C-j and C-k to up/down, but the comments says it doesn't work well hm
[15:51:23] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> I actually searched for `evil-paste-pop-next` in the github repo to make sure they didn't add those lately, although it would have surprised me
[15:52:24] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> ah wait, are you doing this in normal mode?
[15:53:06] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> Yes, in normal mode!
[15:53:32] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> But behaviour is the same in both normal and insert mode fo rme
[15:53:33] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> for me
[15:53:35] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> for C-j and C-k
[15:54:16] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> yeah, those don't work for me either
[15:54:32] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> and what are they bound to, for you?
[15:55:50] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> in vterm they get passed to the underlying shell
[15:56:39] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> C-p and C-n too, so those are the ones that move through history
[15:57:21] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> For me C-p and C-n don't get passed
[15:57:32] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> they instead do those paste things
[15:57:33] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> hmmmm weird
[15:57:37] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> btw I am looking at https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/layers/%2Btools/shell/packages.el#L301 now
[15:57:47] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> it does seem like it defines C-j and C-k to be up and down
[15:58:10] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> since M-p and M-n work for you, you can use `SPC h d k M-p/M-n` to see what they're bound to and define your own binds
[15:58:46] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> yeah it is vterm-send-down and vterm-send-up
[15:58:52] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> so I should map other things to those
[15:59:23] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> I am just wondering why I don't get expected behaviour from the start -> if the docs are wrong or not. But now it seems like problem might be on my side, I just can't figure out what it could be
[15:59:25] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> anyway thanks a lot!
[15:59:30] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> yeah. Again, it should work out of the box, so there might be something wrong with your config, but if it works for you then that's fine
[16:11:18] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> I managed to get it working in insert mode by doing: ‚èé   (define-key vterm-mode-map (kbd "C-p") 'vterm-send-up) ‚èé   (define-key vterm-mode-map (kbd "C-n") 'vterm-send-down)
[16:11:24] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> however it still behaves as previously in the normal mode
[16:11:46] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> I tried adding ‚èé (evil-define-key 'normal vterm-mode-map (kbd "C-p") 'vterm-send-up) ‚èé (evil-define-key 'normal vterm-mode-map (kbd "C-n") 'vterm-send-down) ‚èé but it doesn't help [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=617bec0a7db1e3753e6d23fe]
[16:11:55] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> @fran-penedo any idea how to get this working?
[16:20:44] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> I don't, evil and terms sometimes don't play well with each other. Maybe someone who knows more about evil can help?
[16:24:22] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> Actually I was wrong, none of this lines I wrote above worked -> vterm-mode-map symbol is not defined
[16:24:38] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> no prob @fran-penedo , thanks, at least I have a direction in which it investigate further!
[16:25:26] <FromGitter> <fran-penedo> surround them with `(with-eval-after-load 'vterm ...)`
[16:28:59] <FromGitter> <Martinsos> Yay that worked!!! So at the end what did it was: ‚èé (with-eval-after-load 'vterm (evil-define-key 'normal vterm-mode-map (kbd "C-p") 'vterm-send-up)) ‚èé (with-eval-after-load 'vterm (evil-define-key 'normal vterm-mode-map (kbd "C-n") 'vterm-send-down)) ‚èé  ‚èé Now both in insert and in normal mode, C-p and C-n act as up/down. insert mode was already working, but with this I successfully set C-p and C-n for
