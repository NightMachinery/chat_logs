[05:08:16] <quanticle> What does "reactivity" mean, in this case?
[05:08:43] <quanticle> "However, most programs also have a stateful subset, and I believe a productive language needs to make it easy to do stateful things in a natural way too. But that stateful subset of a project's logic should be kept as small as possible, and should be isolated from the functional subset."
[05:08:57] <quanticle> Isn't that what Haskell does by confining stateful updates to monads?

[22:05:24] <imode> and what the memory bloat would look like for arbitrary WASM apps.
[22:11:09] <companion_cube> imode: afaik, jit, but not tracing jit. It's static enough you can just translate it to asm on the fly once before execution
[22:12:24] <imode> I was wondering how that worked.
[22:12:47] <imode> WASM's control flow is structured so I imagine that makes emitting stuff a little simpler.
[22:14:15] <companion_cube> It's not harder than compiling, say, pascal to aam
