[06:40:30] <Dan39> oh this is ##bittorrent
[06:41:19] <Dan39> didn't realize i added this to my autojoin, thoght i was in #bittornado lol and was like "wow, is this dude actually using bittornado!?"

[15:34:32] <lumberjack123> HHi what does BT use to hash files to confirm bit for bit identical amongst peers?
[15:42:39] <DeHackEd> it's sha1
[16:50:56] <The_8472> v1 uses a flat list of sha1 hashes, v2 uses sha2-256 merkle trees
[17:18:53] <TheSHAD0W> Have there been any collision attacks found for BT1 yet?

[17:31:53] <TheSHAD0W> It might be fun to add something to clients to look for potential metadata collision attacks.
[17:33:06] <TheSHAD0W> If you start getting bad pieces from a number of different clients, redownload the metadata from those clients and look for a different data set from the one you're working with.

[17:34:04] <DeHackEd> since google published an sha1 collision, you could build one
[17:35:01] <DeHackEd> I don't know that you could usefully produce a good vs malicious payload with the same SHA1 such that the good payload would pass scrutiny..
