[11:59:07] <gour> i'm trying to integrate neomutt with taskwarrior and have problem to retrieve message's filename to store it as attachment in taskwarrior, but wonder if notmuch can help me...iow. can i somehow retrieve the filename of the message as stored in the Maildir store by using message-id?

[12:09:46] <inwit> :)
[12:15:11] <inwit> Now, at first I thought notmuch-read-tag-changes-history was a general store for past tag changes. Of course, as it name says, is just a store of changes done with notmuch-read-tag-changes. Is there another variable storing the full history of tag changes? This could be useful for undoing tag changes, for example.
[12:18:41] *** Quits: bindu (~bindu@user/bindu) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:18:58] *** Joins: bindu (~bindu@user/bindu)
[12:19:36] <inwit> My current problem is that I can't reapply tag changes done through notmuch-tag-jump: for some reason, only some of the tags thus applied are stored in notmuch-read-tag-changes-history.
[14:34:10] <gour> i use msgs = Query(db,'id:pid').search_messages() to find desired message and it could be only one. how to easily/simply get the filename of the message?
[14:35:01] <gour> i'd like to use e.g. get_filename(), but it looks one has to iterate within Messages list?
[14:45:54] <gour> anyone can help with this: https://paste.debian.net/1228428/
[14:46:11] <inwit> gour: I believe your problem might be related with the fact that several filenames can correspond with a single message.
[14:46:56] <gour> inwit: hmm, how could that be?
[14:47:17] <bookworm> that's how email works... you copy a message into multiple folders
[14:47:27] <bremner> gour: I'd recommend using the new python bindings. The old ones will be dropped sometime soon
[14:47:30] <bookworm> and they all correspond to the same message
[14:47:35] <gour> otoh, i'm just referencing single mesage
[14:47:40] <bookworm> or well, imap
[14:49:18] <bremner> inwit: I don't think such a variable exists. One issue is that tagging can happen outside emacs.
[14:49:31] <bookworm> one "message" as you call it (unique Message-ID) may be in inbox, flagged/starred and todo at the same time.. if you sync all of them with a synchronize tools you'll get 3 copies that notmuch then dedups gour
[14:50:53] <inwit> bremner: I see... wouldn't it be nice to have it even though it affects only tag changes inside emacs?
[14:51:01] <gour> now i see that old bindings were installed due to afew...let me check new ones
[14:51:24] <bremner> inwit: yeah, it might make sense.
[14:51:57] <bremner> gour: I thought afew had migrated.
[14:53:21] <bremner> inwit: afair, all the tagging goes through that one function, so you could have log those changes.
[14:54:22] <inwit> bremner: In fact, no: apparently when you use notmuch-tag-jump, that variable is not properly updated (or I'm mistaken). I'll dig a bit.
[14:54:40] <gour> bremner: nope. i'm on debian/sid which has the latest 3.0.1
[14:56:00] <bremner> inwit: I mean the function notmuch-tag
[14:56:11] <bremner> which could hypothetically keep a history
[14:56:22] <gour> where are the docs for notmuch2 bindings?
[14:56:57] <bremner> https://notmuchmail.org/doc/latest/python-bindings.html
[14:57:57] <bremner> (I agree they should be installed with the debian package, but I think they are not, currently)
[14:58:36] <gour> thanks, i missed the link...spent some time to understand how to use (old) ones...hopefully, it will be quicker now ðŸ˜„
[14:59:44] <inwit> bremner: Understood. I'm slowly learning elisp. It might be a good starting project to add that global tag history capability. I guess it's a matter to replicate what's done in notmuch-read-tag-changes with a new variable notmuch-tag-changes-history.
[15:00:37] <bremner> inwit: roughly speaking. But I would store the changes already parsed, since that is how they come in to the function
[15:01:11] <bremner> for personal use you can just add hooks, no need to modify the function
[15:01:28] *** Quits: tubogram4 (~tubogram@user/tubogram) (Quit: See ya later!)
[15:03:38] <inwit> bremner, sorry, what do you mean with "already parsed"? I see notmuch-tag does some checks before applying tags, we should keep the tags after those checks, right?
[15:04:25] <bremner> inwit: probably. I just mean that notmuch-read-tag-changes is a list of strings read (one string for each operation). I would not suggest that for a new variable
[15:05:10] <inwit> bremner: understood. It might be better to have a list of lists of tags?
[15:05:21] <bremner> right.
[15:05:35] <bremner> maybe with + or -
[15:06:24] <inwit> Cool. I'll look into it. Having a general undo capability might prove useful in some cases. And repeating tags could be more robust.
[15:07:01] <inwit> Else, I can always go for the hooks.
[15:40:41] <gour> i'm still puzzled why i'm getting the error when using python bindings since: 'notmuch search --output=files id:msgid returns only single file?
[15:54:06] <bremner> dunno, since it's a short script, maybe rewrite with new bindings. I think you just need to change Query(db,...) to db.query(...)
