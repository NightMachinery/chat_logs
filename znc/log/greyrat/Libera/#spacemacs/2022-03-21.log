[05:07:36] <FromGitter> <coventry> I'm getting a lot of errors when trying to create a fresh spacemacs instance, like `Package bind-key is unavailable. Is the package name misspelled?`, for over 120 packages. Is there a problem with one of the package repos?
[05:08:29] <FromGitter> <coventry> `bind-key` is supposedly available on MELPA, according to their search box.
[05:15:57] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> this could be a network issue
[05:33:52] <FromGitter> <coventry> I worked around it by adding `package-refresh-contents` at the beginning of the `init.el` file. Not sure why spacemacs's usual routine wasn't pulling in the MELPA list, but that fixed it.
[05:34:30] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> if that's added the load time will be longer
[06:03:24] <FromGitter> <coventry> It is, but at least it  got me past a show stopper.
[06:03:34] <FromGitter> <coventry> And now that it's updated, I don't need it anymore.
[06:03:40] <FromGitter> <coventry> (For now, at least.)
[06:52:51] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> @lebensterben, is this (https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/pull/15418) what you meant by in-lining the functions in `core/core-load-paths.el`?

[07:47:43] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> I read the synopsis of that article, but based on your feedback on the commit I don't think I understood.
[07:48:06] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Did you really mean to hard-code the additions to the load path instead?
[07:49:46] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Ohh... I see now.
[07:50:10] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> I'll make another commit then it should be good to merge if you still think removing the functions is a good idea.

[07:53:27] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Okay. In this case, then, since the objective is to remove an unnecessary function call, and `dolist` is already evaluating body repeatedly we can just barf the if form and delete the funcall.
[07:53:35] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Do I understand now?
[07:54:18] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> The `:=` syntax confused me, but I understood that its replacing the call to a function with the body of the function.
[07:54:48] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> that's production rules ...

[07:58:23] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Quite.
[08:45:11] <FromGitter> <bryce-carson> Actually, @lebensterben, is the pull request good with the let form? It seems awkward. How would you rewrite this? I'm trying to get better at my Elisp.
[08:46:48] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> that's good enough
[08:51:15] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> but a hidden problem is the way how we concat file path

[11:32:52] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @bryce-carson On the other hand it is called Spacemacs not Alt-m macs. So it seems to be mainly designed to be used with vim eybindings. Also the 'sub-slogan' (or whatever such thing is called) reads: 'The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs and Vim!'
[11:33:41] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So I guess 'is mainly designed for evil, but can be used with' would be quite accurate
[11:35:33] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I have no strong opinion about adding bindings or not... but I would just like to mention that it would be nice that if you mentions `SPC m` then you should also mention its 'prefered' alternative `,`
[11:37:02] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah okay... I read this here now... so now you know 'what `,` is for'
