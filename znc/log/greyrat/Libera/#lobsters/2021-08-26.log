[19:31:17] <comewer> In "Thousands of Debian packages updated from their upstream Git repository", my thought is that it's disturbing how little anything gets looked at. For that matter, the whole industry is about automatically pulling things from everywhere (javascript, etc.), and it’s a wonder it works sometimes instead of toppling and staying toppled.
[19:35:31] <cot> Kinda like that recent incident where malicious patches were sent to the kernel repos... and accepted (before being reverted).

[19:57:30] <JordiGH> So we have this one web thing at work we want to deploy and most of our things are not on Docker but this one thing is on Docker but not like the other thing that's on Docker.
[19:58:30] <JordiGH> So we're like, we really should make this thing look like the other things (and probably not use Docker) but the admins are like just fucking deploy the thing so we're like alright, we'll fucking deploy the thing and make it more like the other things later, but the more we keep trying to fucking deploy the thing the more unlike the other things it starting to look.
[19:58:32] <ghostmonk> LOL... are you answering your own questions JordiGH
[19:59:09] <JordiGH> We were supposed to just do a quick thing to get the thing deployed and fix it later but the quick thing is getting more and more complicated and more unlike anything else and making it harder to fix it later.
[19:59:11] <ghostmonk> Why not just make everything look like Docker? :troll:
[19:59:55] <ghostmonk> How is everything else deployed?
[20:00:10] <ghostmonk> and yeah... this sounds like everything in tech.
[20:00:23] <ghostmonk> "So I'm just gonna do this thing quick quick..."
[20:00:30] <ghostmonk> four weeks later...
[20:00:41] <ghostmonk> "This was the worst decision ever!!"
[20:00:44] <varjag> cot: malicious patches weren't accepted
[20:00:52] <ghostmonk> Very next job...
[20:00:54] <JordiGH> Everything else is AMIs handled by AWS autoscaling groups.
[20:00:59] <varjag> some other patches from same malicious actors however were accepted
[20:01:11] <ghostmonk> "So I'm just gonna do this thing quick quick"
[20:01:12] <JordiGH> 'Cause we are caveman who cannot into Docker.
[20:02:07] <ghostmonk> Nothing really wrong with AMIs... but can't you deploy a docker image to an AMI?
[20:02:15] <c355e3b> you can
[20:02:29] <c355e3b> but its a whole lot of crying
[20:02:38] <ghostmonk> ahh
[20:02:40] <c355e3b> but then again so is everything AMI related
[20:03:04] <ghostmonk> feels like everything is a whole lot of crying if you ask me
[20:03:13] <ghostmonk> see my messages above
[20:03:38] <JordiGH> We have an AMI that hosts the Docker instances which are managed by ECS, I think.
[20:04:09] *** Joins: seschwar (~seschwar@user/seschwar)
[20:04:44] <JordiGH> I guess we should use Fargate so we don't put the Docker instances in an EC2 instance?
[20:04:58] <JordiGH> Or we should move everything into AWS Lambda.
[20:05:24] <c355e3b> So this is peak online menu https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/1F96Lgkt/Screen%20Shot%202021-08-26%20at%2011.35.07%20AM.png

[20:05:49] *** Joins: fwg (~fwg@user/fwg)
[20:05:53] <JordiGH> So the way it's been so far is that Flask things are in Docker and Django things are in AMIs. Now we're doing a Django thing in Docker and the config is all slightly different and nobody who did either of the two previous configs are around to help.
[20:05:55] <ghostmonk> I mean... technically you can just remove the docker file and compile the thing separately
[20:06:19] <JordiGH> The docker thing runs a Django thing that tells you how badly is your company polluting.
[20:06:22] <ghostmonk> You might have to re-write out all the dependencies for the environment though

[20:06:42] <ghostmonk> so you just need a python base image with Django right?
[20:06:48] <JordiGH> c355e3b: These numbers...
[20:07:04] <JordiGH> ghostmonk: we also need to figure out how to tell Django to not use an MTA.
[20:07:06] <ghostmonk> seems like if you are having so much issue with docker, I'd just drop it
[20:07:11] <JordiGH> Which just means digging more into Django configs.
[20:07:20] <ghostmonk> ahh... don't know what that is
[20:07:42] <JordiGH> We do want to drop Docker but someone already started the config and the admins are like "fucking deploy it already" and we're trying to fucking deploy it already.
[20:08:05] <Ticho> at some point, doing this, you have to be tempted to just say "fuck it all, i'm going to move to the country and herd sheep or something" :)
[20:08:14] <JordiGH> Well, the person who started the config did it about a year ago and they quit the company about six months ago. Also, we're a small clownshoes operation. Our entire dev team is 8 or 9 people.
[20:08:29] <JordiGH> Ticho: goatops.com is always an option
[20:08:38] <Ticho> I'm afraid to open the url...
[20:08:40] <ghostmonk> hahah... depends I suppose. I think if I was faced with this, I would drop Docker and just throw the application into an AMI
[20:08:54] <ghostmonk> Ticho... this is a thing I think about often
[20:09:27] <cot> varjag: wait, is that so? I recall hearing that there were a few patches that made it into alternative upstreams that had to be reverted.
[20:09:48] <JordiGH> Ticho: goatops.com is probably NSFW in the same way that reading union literature could be NSFW.
[20:10:32] <Ticho> JordiGH: yeah, I opened it and had a few good chuckles already, thanks!
