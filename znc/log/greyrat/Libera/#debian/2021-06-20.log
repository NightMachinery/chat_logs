[00:02:31] <amacater> If you want Debian without systemd - you can do it with a little difficulty - or you can opt to run Devuan. Devuan is probably off-topic for here :)

[01:25:09] <amacater> Debian and a bunch of others forked to go to OFTC then - it may even have been governance / free software ideology - it's a long time ago now and so OFTC has a few organisations that have historically preferred that network

[15:46:20] <ratrace> at that point, we might all just switch, assumign the implementation is sane, because systemd's implementation sucks.

[16:02:21] <PMT> seriously, anyone who knew motherboards play games with PCIe lane wiring could have seen this coming
[16:02:22] <ratrace> the behaviour has been known for decades. yes, bios/hw is buggy, might reorder/change-name on boot.   if they had ANY experience with that, they'd know that using topology for naming wout NOT SOLVE ANYTHING.
[16:02:41] <ratrace> for YEARS before udev "predictably" naming, we were tieing MACs to ethX names and everything WAS GOOD.
[16:02:48] <PMT> in their defense, motherboards playing games with PCIe lanes is a pretty recent phenomenon before becoming common
[16:03:32] <PMT> ratrace: i really should go look up what the justification systemd used for removing the persistent-net functionality is
[16:03:53] <ratrace> there's no defense here. they're inexperienced, plain and simple. and that just extends into vast ecosystem that's "systemd middleware", and the implementation is so terrible....

[22:06:28] <jelly> it's interesting you managed to tell debian-installer not to have it installed
[22:07:06] <velix> jelly: Normal netinstall.
[22:07:12] <ioxzev1z> How long will it roughly take for 11 to release? iirc they have usually released around the start of July
[22:07:23] <jelly> !wwbr
[22:07:24] <dpkg> Now Debian "Bullseye" is the current testing branch as of 2019-07-06 and it will be released "when it's ready."
[22:07:35] <velix> jelly: Interesting. superuser.com says `apt install systemd-sysv` :)
[22:07:56] <jmcnaught> !bullseye
[22:07:57] <dpkg> The release following Debian 10 "Buster" is codenamed "Bullseye" (Woody's horse in Toy Story 2) and will be Debian 11. Tentative release date: 2021-07-31. Good bug reports on packages and upgrades are greatly appreciated! https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBullseye . Bullseye is Debian turned up to 11! <buster->bullseye> <install bullseye>
[22:08:21] <ansgar> bullseye factoid clearly beats wwbr :D
[22:08:31] <ioxzev1z> jmcnaught, thanks
[22:08:36] <jhutchins> I believe there is a semi-final freeze scheduled for 7/10
[22:08:50] <ratrace> still alotta RC bugs to solve
[22:08:52] <jelly> "tentative" is a loaded term
[22:09:18] <ratrace> if you check with a ruler, the release date is probably late august or even september :)
[22:09:18] <velix> jelly: I've checked three of my VPS: none has dbus installed.
[22:10:00] <amacater> I can confirm there's work still to be done but we're on the final straight.
[22:10:18] <ratrace> most of my machiens are already on bullseye :)
[22:10:28] <ratrace> (xcept for production servers)
[22:10:32] <jelly> velix, interesting.  I haven't done any bullseye installations from scratch yet and our preseed is basically minimal+20-odd packages on top
[22:10:54] <amacater> Freeze on 10th July is to allow time for everything to stop and for the final tweaks to be done.
[22:11:01] <velix> jelly: my stable servers use buster. But hmmm. It's fine for me. I now know: reboot or start manually.
[22:11:07] <velix> jelly: Start manually works without a problem.
[22:11:13] <ratrace> dbus stopped to a dependency of systemd before stretch. it's now pulled in only by GUI apps
[22:11:22] <ratrace> stopped *being a
[22:11:28] <amacater> There are a chunk of notes on this on the Debian mailing lists
[22:11:31] <jelly> velix, I would NOT count on things working correctly regarding systemd<->dbus without a reboot
[22:12:00] <velix> ratrace: ah, thanks
[22:12:08] <velix> jelly: sure. But a message would be nice ;)
[22:12:15] <velix> "don't forget to reboot"
[22:12:18] <jelly> velix, pls file bug reports tnx
[22:12:31] <velix> Ok. In 8 hours when it's getting cold.
[22:12:47] <velix> 19:42 here and > 30 °C :(
[22:12:57] * jelly shrugs
[22:13:06] <ratrace> 22 'ere
[22:13:38] <jelly> velix, same here, I'd go for a swim if it weren't for the mosquitos

[23:34:04] <amacater> Users start at 1000, system users are below that traditionally. I think Red Hat has moved that to users starting at 500 - so that's interesting for cross-domain working ...
[23:34:32] <PMT> I think that redhat change happened a long while ago now, though, from what I recall.
[23:34:36] <amacater> At least for Buster, first user created is 1000 - just checked

[23:40:10] <velix> Okay. So I need to create a user without login.
[23:40:39] <velix> That'll get me UID >= 1000 and an entry in sub*id
[23:41:39] <velix> `adduser --disable-passwd --disabled-login` should do
[23:41:45] *** Joins: Iamthehuman (~noname@user/iamthehuman)
[23:42:09] <amacater> Also set shell to nologin or some such
[23:43:26] <velix> I think --disabled-login does this
[23:43:40] <velix> -> /usr/sbin/nologin
[23:44:00] <amacater> Yes, that's it :)
[23:45:11] <velix> No, uh! It doesn't do it.
[23:45:22] <velix> velix:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/velix:/bin/bash <-- uh!
[23:45:24] <jhutchins> velix: Does this happen to be for secure file transfer?

[23:46:39] <velix> Oh, --disabled-login just means: "Do not run passwd to set the password."
[23:47:00] <amacater> However, if you want to ever do anything as that user if you are root: su - [username] will work
[23:47:20] <velix> amacater: yeah, sure.
[23:47:31] <velix> or `machinectl shell velix@.host /usr/bin/bash` and stuff
[23:48:14] *** Joins: hitest (~hitest@user/hitest)
[23:48:17] <velix> amacater: actually `su -` won't work, but `su -c bin/bash velix` will do (but have problems)
[23:48:18] <amacater> and the user gets a bash shell - I've just created a testuser that way
[23:48:26] <velix> amacater: yeah
[23:48:34] <velix> I could just link  it to rbash
[23:48:39] <velix> But I don't need this security.
[23:48:46] <velix> I just need a user for a service.
[23:49:52] <amacater> velix - su - does work and gives you that test users environment
[23:50:22] <velix> amacater: That shouldn't work when you've set to /usr/sbin/nologin ?
[23:51:03] <jhutchins> amacater: You should be aware that nologin is exploitable.
[23:51:49] *** Joins: tremon (~tremon@217-63-61-89.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl)
[23:52:01] <amacater> If you do set the shell to nologin using chsh, then yes, it reports that account as not available - that doesn't mean that it doesn't have a default shell ...
[23:52:46] <amacater> jhutchins - Yes, I'm not worrying about that here - I'll delete the testuser fairly soon - busy learning
[23:52:54] <amacater> or reminding myself
[23:53:07] <velix> jhutchins: tell me more, just curious
[23:53:12] <jhutchins> amacater: It's a quick and easy to lock something down.
[23:53:55] <jhutchins> velix: I don't know the details of the exploit, I just know it wasn't good enough for Federal system security.  There's a different procedure to lock down ssh/scp.
[23:54:48] <velix> jhutchins: okay, that's not what I'm after. The user is disallowed in ssh config ;)
[23:55:09] <jhutchins> velix: Understood, but that's why I asked.
