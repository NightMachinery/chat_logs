[00:16:38] <GaM3r2Xtreme> true, i guess the drivers are the next hardest thing to deal with. that's why AMD gpus are the ones recommended to use with a linux based OS. they have better support?
[00:16:59] <Thaurwylth> Uh, isn't that a completely different issue?
[00:17:19] <ZombieChicken> I think it depends on which driver you want to use, the architecture of the GPU itself, status and support of the f/oss driver if you want to use it...
[00:17:23] <Thaurwylth> I mean it's, say, TensorFlow that is supposed to make the CUDA calls to the card, for purely computation purposes.

[00:46:43] <ghostbuster> I'm not familiar with dd-wrt but my guess is that it supports a local dns cache, where you could redirect some.cool.domain to 192.168.1.123 fairly easily though
[00:46:44] <hexnewbie> URLs definitely do, but hostnames don't
[00:46:47] <tirnanog> urls can certainly have ports. hostnames - which is what this is about - can't.

[00:47:39] <themachine> GaM3r2Xtreme: dnsmasq can definitely do that "minus the port in the hostname because hostnames don't have ports"
[00:47:43] <GaM3r2Xtreme> hmm, maybe that's why it wasn't working then? so I could maybe do 'some.cool.url:1234' instead?

[00:47:45] <tirnanog> also, dnsmasq can handle this.
[00:47:56] <themachine> not comment on dd-wrt though, I just run a separate dnsmasq server on my debian router
[00:48:10] <tirnanog> all you have to do is edit /etc/hosts and make sure that dnsmasq isn't started with the no-hosts option.

[00:48:50] <GaM3r2Xtreme> i think the dd-wrt firmware just runs dnsmasq in the background to handle the request (how it does this is unknown to me).
[00:48:52] <tirnanog> some.cool.url is not an url. it's a hostname.
[00:49:07] <tirnanog> yes, I know. hencel, it should be possible.
[00:49:10] <GaM3r2Xtreme> ok, let me see if I can ssh into the router then and check that file. I should be able to do that I would think

[00:49:35] <MrElendig> ddwrt probably have a gui option for dns override
[00:49:39] <tirnanog> you might need to figure out how to tweak the options given to dnsmasq though (in case no-hosts is specified).
[00:49:41] <ghostbuster> is 192.168.1.123 statically assigned? if not, you'll need to update /etc/hosts each time it changes
[00:49:48] <tirnanog> I'm sure dd-wrt can handle it, one way or another.

[01:50:33] <Gaboradon> One drive has like 20 short tests in the log already and it's kinda annoying as it confuses which are mine and which were automated. Looks like it does only short so I see I already did an extended tests with the new 4TB drive.

[01:51:18] <Gaboradon> Yes no harm indeed, it's just not what I currently want when I'm dealing with managing it manually, I can enable it later, but with lesser frequency if possible.

[01:54:25] <Gaboradon> I'm glad tho that the HDD firmware deals with that and no problem has arisen so far, because I was going to do an extended test, and then this service would kick in it's short test, possibly interrupting my extended test and running that instead, still not harm but very annoying to wake up in the morning without having it finished.

[03:56:54] <Gaboradon> Dagmar: Well I just complained how smartctl did something it didn't say it would in the docs, if you read manpage on "-t offline" it doesn't mention it'll do a self-test, no big deal, it's just unexpected
[03:57:13] <TonyStone> I am writing a little program for linux and windows using Lazarus.  Linux is giving me lots of issues with the particular project I am working on.  I am building a password assistant utility... and the system types your passwords for you...   however I am running into issues where the system is typing and combining keys with the keys the user has physically pressed...
[03:57:15] <Dagmar> The -t being for "test" is kind of a hint, yo.
[03:57:52] <Dagmar> ...and pretty much everything is off the table if say, the controller boards cache RAM is bad, which is one of the things the short test generally does
[03:57:58] <Dagmar> In _seconds_.
[03:58:15] <TonyStone> So my user will press a hotkey to type the password... Ctrl+Shift+P for example... and then if the user doesnt lift fingers fast enough the system thinks other keys are being typed
[03:58:21] <Dagmar> ...which is why it makes sure it's capable of properly reporting errors with unexpected seek misses and so on before it tries
[03:59:17] <Dagmar> TonyStone: Luckily for you, Linux can handle more than one keyboard at a time
[03:59:23] <Gaboradon> Dagmar: read the "-o" manpage, it says "The choice (made by the SFF-8035i and ATA specification authors) of the word testing for these first two categories is  unfortunate,  and  often leads  to  confusion.   In fact these first two categories of online and offline testing could have been more accurately described as online and offline data collection.
[03:59:24] <TonyStone> is there some way to temporarily disable the users keyboard ?
[03:59:32] <rascul> unplug it
[03:59:40] <Dagmar> You need to send your input in through a phony keyboard, not inject it into the stream of bytes coming from the real keyboard, or you _will_ confuse the keyboard driver

[04:00:35] <TonyStone> so i may need to write my own keyboard driver ?
[04:00:44] <Dagmar> This is why I'm saying you almost certainly never needed the offline tests to begin with
[04:01:14] <Gaboradon> Dagmar: So, specifying -t offline would send the command to collect data in offline mode, something which I think should happen in moments, not the full 7 hours of an extended self-test (category 3 test as per ATA spec)

[04:09:37] <Gaboradon> So my point was, since it's not testing anything it shouldn't take 7 full hours of a self-test (actual surface scan and test), it's a bit of a thing smartctl does ontop and doesn't explain why. That's all I came here to say.

[05:25:25] <Nyx_Eris> hello, I have a bit of an issue. So my PC comes with a card reader and I am trying to format my SD card, my file explorer cant seem to reconize it so I tried scanning for it with the pcsc_scan utility, but however it keeps getting hanged on "Waiting for the first reader..." I dont know if this is a result of the sd card not being reconized or something else.
[05:25:32] <Nyx_Eris> But when, running the command "lsusb" I noticed it is there on bus 1 as a usb device. I made sure to install the required packages and start the correct servers and mentiond in my distorbutions (arch) wiki. How can I get my card reader working correctly?

[05:39:30] <tirnanog> perhaps the game is a cryptocurrency miner on the side.

[05:40:25] <tirnanog> yes, I wasn't joking.

[05:40:48] <tirnanog> then again, it could just be a dreadfully inefficient game.
[05:41:05] <jensen> Is fail2ban redundant if you disable passphrase authentication (which you should) and only enable key authentication? What other precautions to take for best security practices and is it safe to run sshd permanently on your desktop machine?

[05:42:30] <MrElendig> babyface: depends on the distro
[05:42:30] <jim> jensen, you mean for ssh? you can disable pass-word- auth, not pass-phrase
[05:42:54] <MrElendig> babyface: if it uses systemd, then systemd.unit=multi-user.target will usually do the job
[05:42:56] <def__> MrElendig: I think the cooling solution is good, as I literally never heard it spin
[05:43:02] <Nyx_Eris> ok here it is, sorry it took a while. Did not have netcat installed: https://termbin.com/rmac
[05:43:15] <MrElendig> def__: only because you have never loaded the machine to 100%
[05:43:20] <MrElendig> clearly
[05:43:23] <tirnanog> jensen: pretty much. at best, it could still play a role in reducing log noise but there are other ways to go about that, such as netfilter rate limiting or simply operating on a randomly chosen port instead of 22.
[05:43:35] <rascul> Nyx_Eris is that with the sd card in or out?
[05:43:55] <babyface> MrElendig, you wouldn't know if there's a keyboard combination I can use?

[06:12:58] <tirnanog> the latter two can be grotesquely inefficient if you want to use the delta transfer algorithm. the reasons should be apparent if you think about it.
[06:13:02] <xx> also rsync over ssh is the only mode where you have the actual rsync client/server model
[06:13:15] <jensen> anyone use etckeeper? I am looking for a tool that tracks default system configs and their changes. That way I can compare just change changes (diff) to my heavily customized config and easily merge in any relevant changes, as opposed to comparing my config to the full copy of the new default system config every time it's updated
[06:13:19] <lockywolf> fuse is not the limiting factor if the network is slow
[06:13:28] <tirnanog> rsync/ssh has the benefit of spawning rsync on the remote side, where it can perform various I/O operations locally.

[06:41:00] <wodencafe> Worth a shot then :) So, this is in a local VM, where both the guest and host are running KDE on Ubuntu 21.10. The VM says the xrdp service is active, and the rdp client from the host connecting to the guest properly prompts for a password. It even shows a KDE loading screen when the correct password is entered. And then the rdp client screen turns black, and nothing happens.

[06:58:29] <peetaur> lockywolf: a proper backup has many snapshots in time so when you discover a file was broken 3 backups ago, it's not still gone. Also ideally you don't give your backed up machine access to damage the backup, like by plugging it into the same machine. Even a simple thing like bad RAM could break both.
[06:58:50] <flimsypondreed> figured it out!

[11:25:15] <cluelessperson> bitplane, why would a random service have full access to the information the ldap server serves?

[11:26:23] <cluelessperson> some services to support or try pulling down ldap information to cache, sure, but I don't think that's really an issue.
[11:26:29] <ayecee> nope. the way individuals are authed is to basically sign into the ldap server with the user-provided credentials.
[11:26:53] <bitplane> I don't get the need for source control. Maybe I misunderstood

[13:38:49] <bonsaikitten> NGC3982: the advantage of filesystem snapshots is that they are atomic and instantaneous (i.e. no copying required as with rsnapshot), so they are "cheap" to do - and you don't have these weird restrictions
[13:39:08] *** Joins: joo-_ (~joo-_@fsf/member/joo--)

It works as expected, but when I try to see the listening process on port 80, I don't find that in `netstat` output. `lsof` also doesn't work. But, when I `curl` localhost at port 80, it works as expected. https://paste.debian.net/plain/1225117 Could someone tell
[14:16:43] <fentanyl> me why netstat doesn't show the port 80?

[15:39:15] <sal7> i'm used to using alt+[0-9] to change tabs in firefox
[15:39:18] <sal7> for example
[15:39:25] <sal7> alt+3 switches to the third tab
[15:39:28] <hexnewbie> Does Alt+Shift+é work for switching the tabs?
[15:39:39] <sal7> nope
[15:39:47] <sal7> anyway
[15:39:50] <hexnewbie> Oh, you've mapped Alt+Shift to the layout switch, no combinations with Alt+Shift will ever work for you
[15:40:11] *** Joins: irc_standardnick (~irc_stand@2402:3a80:b51:9b2d:4780:f2c0:5167:ae7a)
[15:40:12] <sal7> on my old pc, it used to work just fine (even with azerty layout)
[15:40:17] <hexnewbie> I don't think this issue is solvable without making some compromise with those settings
[15:40:24] <sal7> now it just doesn't work with 2 and 7 and 0
[15:40:43] <sal7> and these 3 keys are (é, è, à) in order
[15:40:44] <Elw3> I still dont get if you get a 2 on the key labbeled 2.
[15:41:12] <sal7> wait, lemme just find the software i used to visualize the keyboard yesterday

[15:42:21] <bex> no but he might have
[15:42:44] <hexnewbie> No, their ‘2’ key produces ‘é’, without shift. So Alt+é won't switch tabs, because it's not Alt+2 (even if the toolkit is clever to guess the physical key alt was activated on, xev seems to indicate that such keystroke is lost -- strange though Alt+AltGr+е does work for me to get Alt+é)
[15:42:47] <bex> actually i think he did say something about killing babies

[15:44:39] <sal7> i used the kde's shortcut thing
[15:44:49] <hexnewbie> sal7: Also, your locale appears messed up: On my system, Alt+AltGr+e (é) produces “XLookupString gives 2 bytes: (c3 a9) "é"”, yours is “XLookupString gives 2 bytes: (c3 a9) "Г©"”
[15:44:50] <sal7> this is what i get when i press alt+é

[15:45:21] <sal7> it should be alt+é not alt+big é
[15:45:39] <hexnewbie> sal7: KDE simply capitalizes those. If you made Alt+É a global shortcut somewhere, it also wouldn't work in apps
[15:46:04] <sal7> oh my bad
[15:46:13] <sal7> so how do i fix the locale thing?
[15:46:21] <hexnewbie> sal7: What does 'locale' say?

[18:43:08] <jjakob> you can use filesystem-native snapshots and then copy those snapshots, like btrfs or zfs and then send to a backup destination
[18:43:37] <hexnewbie> At least that's my current disaster recovery plan for when I lose all my data due to Btrfs *again*

[18:49:57] <hexnewbie> koollman: Well, my backups do have snapshots much like the source. However, given the past fragility of btrfs, in the absence of an off-site second backup I may have reservations doing such a thing indeed. But it's not worse than suddenly losing your backup and having only your live as a single copy, which is also going to eventually happen.

[18:50:59] <relipse> is fail2ban important to have running
[18:51:04] <bex> my backups do have backups
[18:51:05] <jjakob> so my recomendation is: if your destination is a cloud service or a local NAS: borgbackup, if the destination is a linux system you control: zfs/btrfs send/receive (either with or without luks on both source and destination) (in any case add multiple copes onto usb drives with borgbackup or luks)
[18:51:05] <uwharrie> relipse: not really
[18:51:16] <koollman> relipse: no. But it can help avoid useless logs
[18:51:56] <hexnewbie> relipse: If somebody set up fail2ban on your system, don't touch it. If you want to implement one yourself, you wouldn't gain as much as you think. So, either way, leave it as-is.

[18:53:02] <koollman> if the rest of your system is safe, fail2ban shouldn't improve the security much
[18:53:11] <koollman> but it will avoid repetitive logs of attacks
[18:53:26] <hexnewbie> When a botnet tries to brute force your SSH password, fail2ban will reduce the logs and system utilisation, from 30000 attempts from 10000 IPs to 20000 attempts from 10000 IPs.
