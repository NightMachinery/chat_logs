[09:49:33] <amigojapan> Ok Urchin[emacs] but not qbasic
[09:49:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cards for programming old computers have me agree. Although the use of languages that require a compiler doesn't work with those.
[09:51:38] <amigojapan> Why not Aurora_v_kosmose ?
[09:51:57] <amigojapan> Cards are just a storage and input means
[09:52:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Well simply because punch cards afaik were directly interpreted as assembly instructions. 
[09:53:05] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: you could have them compile domestic in ram
[09:53:53] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: that's like saying HDDs can't compile anything just cause everything is sorted in binary
[09:54:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Not exactly what I meant. I know what you mean, but mostly I refered to historical usage and to "readably code on the card" that some animes might try to use.
[09:55:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You'd probably use a teletype or other writing machine to encode it as character bytes on the cards.
[09:55:40] <HubertFarnsworth> what's programming? is it like k-on?
[09:55:51] <Urchin[emacs]> Aurora_v_kosmose: FORTRAN could be imputed by punch cards

[10:34:34] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: my first programming language was LOGO, and I had no manual and no teacher
[10:34:39] <HubertFarnsworth> the last programming language I learned was emacs lisp which I did through book
[10:34:56] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I just guessed the commands
[10:35:46] <HubertFarnsworth> not the basic stuff amigojapan, writing code in emacs lisp
[10:35:54] <HubertFarnsworth> and using emacs features
[10:36:01] <HubertFarnsworth> or messing them up
[10:36:06] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I was also 8 years old
[10:37:09] <Urchin[emacs]> well, two books about emacs lisp do come with emacs (except on Debian, you have to download the documentation separately)
[10:37:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Debian does at least still package it.
[10:38:15] <Urchin[emacs]> yep
[10:38:22] <HubertFarnsworth> yeahuup
[10:39:48] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: you are supposed to be able to solve instilled unsolved problems. Looking at solutions to problems does not help
[10:41:10] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: sure, totally but I'd prefer to first learn the elements of language and what it has to offer first.
[10:41:17] <HubertFarnsworth> to know how I can solve the problem
[10:41:30] <HubertFarnsworth> at least I can ponder on
[10:41:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No manual doesn't help when you barely understand the natural language the authors used to make the programming language
[10:44:19] <HubertFarnsworth> true
[10:44:32] <HubertFarnsworth> but do we need to learn that?
[10:44:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> How would amigojapan have guessed "forward" without knowing that forward is a word or what it means?
[10:45:32] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: the turtle helped
[10:45:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Guesses start with some information on which you can build. Otherwise they're effectively just throwing shit at the wall and noting what sticks.
[10:46:50] <Urchin[emacs]> that's a start, though
[10:46:52] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: and once I saw forward works right and left were easy

[11:02:51] <HubertFarnsworth> anyway if you spend time to figure out the basics of language then you'd need a lot more time to do stuff amigojapan 
[11:03:51] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: most of the C based languages are very similar anyway. And nowdays I take a look at stack overflow

[11:20:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A start starting base isn't needing to know everything.
[11:20:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I could hardly reimplement CL from memory, and yet I know enough to code with it.
[11:21:33] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: that's my position. But HubertFarnsworth seems to think he needs to read a book first
[11:21:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> No book will teach you everything anyway.
[11:22:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And you don't need to memorize the book or read it from cover to cover.

[14:50:59] <amigojapan> Genki genki
[14:51:48] <amigojapan> Right lastonestanding 
[14:55:23] <lastonestanding> "The health ministry's population survey shows that in 2019, 1,381,093 people died in Japan. Since 2009, when the country saw a fall in deaths compared to the previous year, the number of dead has risen annually by between 17,000 and 33,000 people."
[14:56:02] <lastonestanding> many old people leads to many deaths per year
[14:58:28] <analoq> the world wide numbers look kinda whack. only 6m death on 7b people. thats merely 0.1%. Werent individual countries reporting deathrates >1%?
[15:01:11] <amigojapan> analoq: I don't think we can trust China's numbers
[15:02:03] <amigojapan> They don't even announce what Omicron is to the public yet, according to my friend

[15:10:28] <lastonestanding> amigojapan: because omicron is still corona
[15:11:06] <lastonestanding> amigojapan: and have you seen how china handles corona? it's a strict no-covid policy
[15:11:16] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: right, but it should still be public news
[15:11:44] <amigojapan> What exactly did no covid mean?
[15:12:12] <lastonestanding> the approach to keep infections at a very very low level
[15:12:46] <lastonestanding> australia and new zealand have tried that
[15:12:50] <Sapphirus> I don't buy that. With the advent of Omicron, with a R number over 10, it's an unrealistic expectation to strive for.
[15:12:52] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: Japan was super strict in travel to Japan and we still got Omicron. It's not easy to avoid

[15:14:27] <amigojapan> Crazy Sapphirus 
[15:14:27] <Sapphirus> And countries that are being stubborn about doing so, are having civil unrest with massive protests.
[15:14:33] <Sapphirus> e.g. Canada

[15:14:57] <lastonestanding> analoq: luls
[15:15:08] <lastonestanding> yeah
[15:15:34] <lastonestanding> the corona topic is being abused by the politicians
[15:15:38] <Sapphirus> Two provinces so far have removed all mandates as a consequence of the protests.
[15:15:40] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: Japan won't open up the border just yet. And no civil unrest
[15:16:03] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, people hare aren't as obedient to authority.
[15:16:12] <amigojapan> Ok
[15:16:41] <Sapphirus> It's clear that none of these things are doing anything appreciable and COVID is here to stay.
[15:17:09] <Sapphirus> Managing it should be the priority without lucking people down.
[15:17:19] <lastonestanding> they are actually doing more harm than good
[15:17:22] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: well in Japan it will still take a while to get the booster shot
[15:17:38] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, boosters have had low uptake here
[15:17:53] <lastonestanding> booster against what?
[15:18:06] <lastonestanding> there is no vaccination against omnicron
[15:18:14] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: Japan was slow to begin with the roll out
[15:18:17] <Sapphirus> Well, I think the boosters are a bit ridiculous. Targeting a spike protein from a virus that resembles nothing of what's dominant now.
[15:18:38] <Sapphirus> Our government has even admitted they don't stop transmission and infection anymore.
[15:18:44] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: the booster shot still makes it better to prevent deaths
[15:19:30] <lastonestanding> you really believe that?
[15:19:37] <amigojapan> Yes
[15:19:46] <Sapphirus> Eventually they'll walk back on that one and admit that it's fully useless.

[15:59:53] <lastonestanding> but africa is pumping out new children like there's no tomorrow
[16:00:01] <amigojapan> lastonestanding that's better than nothing
[16:00:05] <Shinra> in the future I will do some work in their hospitals as a nurse

[16:02:30] <lastonestanding> exactly Shinra 
[16:02:50] <Shinra> they actually need even more than we do due to lack of resources and equipment

[16:07:43] <lastonestanding> amigojapan: the sad truth is that the most effective way to help africa is to reduce/limit the amount of people living there
[16:07:48] <Shinra> you don't put yourself in dumb situations or let people take advantage of you
[16:08:13] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: you can do that with contraceptives
[16:08:36] <Shinra> educating them would be the best way to help them. They're not stupid or lazy, they are completely uneducated
[16:08:45] <lastonestanding> amigojapan: apparently this plan isn't working that great
[16:08:46] <Shinra> Through education everything else will follow
[16:08:51] <Shinra> they wont use birth control
[16:08:55] <Shinra> they require education to use that
[16:09:17] <lastonestanding> they would require a different form of government too
[16:09:31] <Shinra> education is the absolute foundation of it all but to pursue education it needs to be free and they need to be able to eat

[17:19:22] <hi117> can I rant about terraform for a bit?
[17:19:52] <amigojapan> What's that hi117 
[17:20:11] <hi117> its a programming language for deploying stuff to clouds
[17:20:25] <amigojapan> Ok
[17:21:04] <hi117> so why is it that when developers touch terraform, they forget everything they learned about developing code?
[17:21:55] <hi117> they use modules that only include one module, which would be like this function in python: def func(*args): return otherfunc(*args)
[17:22:05] <hi117> this is considered best practice at this point in terraform
[17:22:20] <hi117> and I have no earthly idea how seasoned programmers think this is good
[17:22:42] <hi117> here is one of the most popular terraform modules https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/sqs/aws/latest
[17:22:42] <ImoutoBot> [title] Terraform Registry
[17:22:45] <hi117> it has one resource
[17:22:53] <hi117> it is LITERALLY what I just posted in python
[17:23:15] <hi117> here's another thing, variables
[17:23:31] <hi117> why do developers see the need to make EVERYTHING a variable
[17:23:53] <analoq> hi117: isnt cloud all about "i dont know what im doing"?
[17:24:04] <hi117> you hard code a memory value that's used in one place? make it a variable because we might want to change it
[17:24:21] <hi117> if so, JUST CHANGE THE DAMN HARD CODED VALUE
[17:24:42] *** Joins: dubc (~dubc@85.206.14.9)
[17:24:59] <hi117> variables should only be used as an interface into your module (if its for a module) or for changes that require no review or should not be tracked in code
[17:25:25] <hi117> ie what version of the code to deploy for development environments, since the build systems set that
[17:26:01] <hi117> if you want a variable for reuse in multipule places, either use locals or just reference it from the resource that's primary
[17:26:24] <hi117> also, variables should wholy represent the "change from base configuration"

[17:26:55] <hi117> so non required variables should default to empty (for collections) or some value if not a collection
[17:27:22] <amigojapan> hi117: I think "cloud" started out as a marketing term for "on a server"
[17:27:25] <hi117> like I've seen people define huge data structures as defaults in variables
[17:28:05] <hi117> so if one thing in the default changes, it now has to be reflected in EVERYONE's tfvars
[17:28:08] <analoq> amigojapan: and then they sold clouds to the server guys
[17:28:11] <hi117> which causes drift and tech debt
[17:28:31] <hi117> minimize the interface, have it actually be an abstractoin
[17:28:47] <hi117> analoq: its going that way, but there is a core of "I know what I'm doing" in cloud
[17:29:00] <hi117> you have to not treat cloud as "someone else's datacenter"
[17:29:17] <hi117> avoid raw vms basically everywhere you can
[17:29:19] <hi117> ect
[17:29:49] <hi117> amigojapan: it did, but now its a bit different since people who know how to cloud don't use servers :P
[17:30:22] <amigojapan> Lol
[17:30:48] <DunceCotus> hey amigojapan 
[17:30:49] <Bco1981> there is still a server in the cloud
[17:31:09] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I bought peanuts but let me check what country they come from
[17:31:13] <hi117> right, but you can subdivide and get rid of the server after you're done
[17:31:23] <amigojapan> Hey DunceCotus 
[17:31:29] <DunceCotus> Server up a cloud of meth happy waiter
[17:31:41] <hi117> if you're a game developer, you'll need to have capacity around to manage the load when you release a new title
[17:31:54] <hi117> you only really want that capacity for the week of the release though
[17:31:57] <Bco1981> mirrors
[17:32:05] <Bco1981> ah
[17:32:21] <Bco1981> don't steam and epic just handle that ?
[17:32:24] <amigojapan> Bco1981: the peanuts are from China :(
[17:32:30] <hi117> so without cloud, you'll have to buy a ton of servers, hook them up, coordinate rack space
[17:32:30] <analoq> it basically comes down to ease of outsourcing
[17:32:38] <hi117> then after its done tear it all down and sell them off
[17:32:51] <hi117> Bco1981: kinda sounds like cloud :P
[17:33:02] <hi117> here's another case

[17:33:12] <hi117> your service is only used during american business hours
[17:33:22] <hi117> why keep ALL the servers running all the time?
[17:33:27] <hi117> shut them down at night
[17:33:34] <Bco1981> amigojapan: oh... i wonder where the peanuts in m&m's are from.
[17:33:50] <hi117> with cloud you can put the capital investment towards shutting down servers in addition to power costs
[17:34:00] <Bco1981> hi117: the rest of the world is a wake
[17:34:06] <Bco1981> awake*
[17:34:17] <Bco1981> USA isn't the entire world you know...
[17:34:18] <hi117> right, but you might only need a couple of servers for the rest of the world
[17:34:24] <hi117> instead of 20
[17:34:33] <analoq> cdn's have local datacenters
[17:34:44] <hi117> why pay for 10x excess capacity when you don't need it?
[17:34:54] <hi117> analoq: they do, because they follow the same model
[17:35:01] <analoq> you probably need more capacity during usa off hours :P
[17:35:07] <analoq> not that many ppl in the usa
[17:35:17] <hi117> YOUR particular service might not need the capacity, but someone else will be running batch jobs at night that does
[17:35:34] <Bco1981> analoq: then again, the chinese won't be getting data from there.
[17:35:35] <hi117> so your unneeded capacity is shared with the person who needs it for a different use case
[17:35:36] <analoq> steam is a special usecase imho
[17:35:59] <analoq> they dont sell capacity (directly) afaik
[17:36:27] <hi117> they don't but the same logic applies
[17:36:40] <hi117> one game might need the cacity one day, but only for that one day
[17:36:51] <hi117> then the next day a different game will need it
[17:37:14] <hi117> why should that one game wholy buy capcity (ie buying a server from dell) when they only need it for a bit
[17:37:25] <analoq> they offer their steam service, through which they sell capacity. but that demand will heavily fluctuate as the users are the same for all clients (gamers). so for them off hour shutdowns probably make sense, as they have off hours
[17:37:37] <hi117> and modern cloud allows for per hour, per minute, and per second billing
[17:37:52] <analoq> aws though probably has a more stable usage throughout the day
[17:37:55] <hi117> so you can get just the capacity you need when you need it
[17:38:35] <hi117> analoq: thats the network effects of large cloud, the more people use large cloud the more even their overall usage is, meaning less overall waste and (in theory) cheaper overall prices for everyone
[17:38:59] <hi117> which is why spot instances are a thing
[17:39:39] <analoq> hi117: quantity is one thing, but you want diversity too. steam doesnt have the latter
[17:41:10] <hi117> eh?
[17:41:17] <hi117> is this getting into sjw stuff?

[20:37:21] <MootPoot> I went for a hour long walk in 2 foot deep snow

[20:39:33] <ButterNoodle> tru
[20:41:05] <ButterNoodle> but in that case I wouldnt worry about a psychotic episode if ur doin ssri's, but if ur being treated for schizophrenia, MPD, etc then I think it could open the door for a destructive trip - it pretty much does the opposite of what the treatment is supposed to do
[20:41:10] <NotNew> when i was a young hikikimori i used to sleep a lot, like so much. I once had a pretty vivid dream, it felt like I was tripping. I saw mayself 10-20 years into the future (multiple realities). was pretty scary and I was glad once it was over. I remember that dream sequence for like 10 years afterwards.
