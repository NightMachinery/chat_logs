[00:20:10] <mrig> when I used it at one point, I had to go find an archaic binary of mysql to be able to use it with mysql, due to the more recent version of php not being compatible with the database being used in the code base; I gather this sort of thing is quite a common issue.

[00:24:28] <pyzozord> if you close the tag and have a white space after, PHP engine will send it to the browser, that's because it always functions as a templating engine

[00:34:17] <deniska> pyzozord: you are thinking about it backwards, for some languages it just makes more sense to make interpreters rather than compilers

[00:35:30] <pyzozord> ah indeed, it might be that they just start with language design and then decide it's going to be easier implementing this as interpreted language
[00:35:50] <pyzozord> what's the slowest part of cpython?
[00:36:29] <betterOn1> hi. which app do you use to prepare diagrams visually seems great?
[00:36:33] <deniska> pyzozord: all the indirections and pointer chasing due to genericness of types
[00:36:45] <mrig> If you are writing to a program that is already running, then you might want to use a scripting language for that.

[00:38:33] <beaky> yes haskell too is also similarly cache unfriendly because it uses lazy evaluation almost everywhere so lots of pointer chasing to navigate and evaluate thunks

[02:03:27] <droid3> curious for a e-reader device why do they use a specific epub or ...etc format
[02:03:33] <kveroneau> A route connects endpoints to HTTP resource paths in the URI.
[02:03:53] <kirua> ^.*>? selects the whole line
[02:03:55] <droid3> why didnt all the e-reader device just use the pdf format and have a pdf reader software installed on there devices?
[02:04:21] <kirua> but ^.*> seems to do the trick
[02:04:22] <kveroneau> PDF reading is very resource intensive when compared to the ePub format.
[02:04:30] <droid3> Rather then creating a whole another file format .epub ...etc from just using a great vector based file format like pdf.
[02:04:47] <pavonia> kirua: Possibly `^.*?>`, depending on the used regex engine
[02:04:53] <kveroneau> Also PDFs don't have proper "flow control" making it difficult to use on varying sizes of eInk screen resolutions.
[02:05:00] <kirua> corn266, thx for your help, mehwork solution does the trick :  ^.*>
[02:05:24] <kirua> thx pavonia, what the point of the '?' in '^.*?>' ?
[02:05:28] <mehwork> that's kirua's solution
[02:05:31] <droid3> O so its more so the time complexity with this small e-reader device
[02:05:49] <kirua> pavonia: thx, ^.*?> works too !
[02:05:51] <corn266> all good kirua , btw there's a #regex channel
[02:06:01] <kirua> i didn't know about it  :p
[02:06:04] <pavonia> It's making the match "lazy", i.e. grabing as few characters as necessary only
[02:06:16] <kveroneau> I personally have a Kobo reader, and PDFs are extremely difficult to use on it, due to it's very slow processor, and the scaling of PDF documents doesn't work very well as the responsiveness of the overall device is declined when viewing a PDF document.
[02:06:25] <droid3> as for what you said "Also PDFs don't have proper "flow control" making it difficult to use on varying sizes of eInk screen resolutions."  pdf can be resized and zoom in as good as any epub format its a vector base file format
[02:06:31] <pavonia> kirua: Test your regexes with strings that have multiple '>'s
[02:06:52] <kveroneau> Thus, if I want to read a PDF on a eInk, I use my more beefier Android-based BOOX device from China, as it has a much faster processor for processing PDF documents.
[02:07:18] <droid3> so you must be getting at the layout manager will wrap stuff by default or position stuff not so good as the epub files i meant see that as an issue. But not for zooming in or out for quality
[02:07:20] <kveroneau> Not all PDFs are made the same.

[02:09:44] <droid3> I here you about the question on pdf vs epub ...e-reader file format.
[02:09:48] <corn266> kveroneau did you install alpine linux on your kobo? i bricked mine the first day trying to do that
[02:10:08] <kveroneau> Kindle is well, Kindle.  I've never owned a Kindle.  ePub is a fairly open format with support in many word processors such as LibraOffice to export an ePub.  The same document export from LibraOffice to a PDF does not perform as well as the ePub export.
[02:10:08] <droid3> But why are there more then one format for e-books/e-readers
[02:10:41] <droid3> just a curiousity because i can convert between most formats i need anyway. I just was curious on why 
[02:10:42] <kveroneau> corn266, no.  Instead of trying to install custom software on my Kobo, I just bought an Android-based eInk reader, a BOOX device.
[02:10:51] <corn266> Are y'all familiar with "Calibre - eBook manager"? It can convert between types
[02:11:17] <nomagno> droid3: relevant xkcd: https://xkcd.com/927/
[02:11:18] <bayaz> Title: Standards 
[02:11:27] <corn266> kveroneau I was looking at BOOX as well when making the decision but apparently it's pretty chatty with servers in china
[02:11:36] <droid3> yes i am currently using calibre /playing with it. 
[02:11:41] <kveroneau> droid3, eReaders support many types, even HTML documents and TXT files.  There's no problem with having more options for file formats on a device.
[02:11:54] <droid3> so i can convert fine. and i can use the word process to export to epub as you been saying.
[02:12:27] <droid3> I dont have an issue i just was curious why we had the difference between just using a pdf file vs the e-reader file formats.
[02:12:36] <kveroneau> corn266, I haven't updated mine, and generally keep it offline mostly.  I just copy my documents to it, and never really need to connect it to WiFi.
[02:12:42] <nomagno> I personally just tend to write in plain text, then change to markdown or some other barely-plaintext format
[02:12:57] <nomagno> Then from there to HTML
[02:13:03] <droid3> Now i get it thanks. I am still curious though on why the different e-reader file format is there any one other then epub that the most portable to e-reader devices
[02:13:11] <corn266> makes sense, it's annoying that eReaders without wifi aren't as common now
[02:13:27] <pyzozord> so the car racing generally doesn't do anything for me
[02:13:35] <droid3> I am wondering is epub the most portable is there any format that is portable to all e-readers?
[02:13:46] <nomagno> corn266: just don't connect to any network
[02:13:47] <pyzozord> but car racing filmed from a drone following the cars is amazing
[02:14:18] <droid3> Why couldnt e-readers just use xml /html website pages they be portable
[02:14:19] <pyzozord> it's totally like a game, with ultrarealistic graphics
[02:14:20] <kveroneau> Sometimes you can't easily convert from PDF to ePub, or just don't care.  Say you just want to transfer some personal documents, which aren't publications, having the reader support PDF is fine for that.

[02:15:51] <nomagno> Settling on a standard requires messy humans to interact. That's the point of failure. And it's fine
[02:15:57] <kveroneau> Almost every reader should support ePub, but no so much other formats.  If you are planning on publishing something, go with ePub and generally everyone will be-able to open it on their readers.

[02:16:42] <nomagno> PDF and ePub are both standardized and well backed
[02:16:50] <nomagno> So fair bets to offer
[02:17:43] <droid3> how about for people view e-books can they do it from there smartphone not even sure of this. Is epub only for e-readers or are there apps on smart device to make them into e-book readers as well.
[02:18:10] *** Quits: kirua (~Username@134.238.50.46) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[02:18:29] <kveroneau> There are several ePub readers for non-eReader devices, such as smartphones.
[02:18:39] <corn266> BOOX runs android, you just need an app
[02:18:40] <droid3> I have to say for smart device like tablets, phones ,...etc it seems webpages and pdfs are pretty easy to read they may not even need epub at all
[02:18:41] <Themis3000> There's definitely apps that can read epub files. Adobe makes their own reader as well as theres some open source ones

[02:19:24] <droid3> ok so then why is smart device just able to handle pdf fine yet e-books just need these epub file format/or specific file formats.
[02:19:32] <kveroneau> corn266, BOOX comes with it's own custom UI on top of Android, and has a special built-in app which can view most common eReader formats, including ePub.
[02:19:44] <droid3> Still is the speed all that much more powerful on your smart devices then a ereader

[02:20:17] <nomagno> droid3: ePub is not some super special file format, you're just asking for everyone to do the same thing arbitrarily
[02:20:30] <corn266> kveroneau i'm aware, but there's nothing stopping you from installing a 3rd party app for things like better performance or manga or whatever
[02:20:46] <droid3> i know we talked about this but it seems smart device dont need epub and they can view pdf just fine so at that extent its a pdf based e-reader. And if people where using just those you just have to upload the final book pdf

[02:21:31] <corn266> it was just to say that there's nothing stopping someone from reading ePubs or other various formats on an android device
[02:22:09] <Themis3000> pdf's have a fixed document size though and amount of pages, so it'd suck to view at a different aspect ratio or if you wanted to change text style. Text files and epub files are best suited for books for this reason over pdf's. epub's don't even define a set amount of pages
[02:22:17] <kveroneau> And there are browser plugins for reading ePub right inside the browser too, with very little issues.
[02:22:40] <nomagno> droid3: PDF is not superior ePub. PDF is pretty much just meant to display stuff in a standardized way, be it images, text or shapes, and it does that perfectly, but at thr expense of huge performance variability. ePub allows more flexibility with display, so it doesn't require as much processing
[02:22:40] <Themis3000> Epub is a great format, it's just not widely known about or touched
[02:23:01] <Themis3000> nomagno: +1
[02:23:01] <droid3> i am not trying to stop anybody all i am saying is if pdf was a universal format for all these smart device and e-readers as well. Then we could gaurentee that at least the pdf version can be viewed.

[02:25:12] <nomagno> Until a certain point
[02:25:14] <kveroneau> web tech is designed to build something that resembles a traditional magazine.
[02:25:16] <droid3> how different is epub from just creating a regular css/html/xml webpage then for the e-reader
[02:25:27] <nomagno> As long as their is intelligibility, competition is great
[02:25:32] <pyzozord> kveroneau: nope, it's pretty much it's own thing

[02:49:59] <kveroneau> pyzozord, I've been getting back into writing text adventure games.  Not the same as pen and paper D&D, but you can still craft an entire world for people to roam using your imagination as a DM. :D

[02:52:06] <kveroneau> As a fun test, just to see if I could do it, I recreated the entire overworld from the original Legend of Zelda from the Nintendo as a text adventure.  I wrote a fun description for all of it's 128 screens.  Took awhile, but it was really fun!  You can check it out on my website here: http://tech406.com/hyrule.xml

I am using an engine called AGT, Adventure Game Toolkit from the 90s, that doesn't try to overcomplicate the game creation process with too much coding.

[03:02:11] <pyzozord> I have my own ideas
[03:02:13] <kveroneau> pyzozord, yup.  Didn't take too long.  Some of the screens were more difficult to create descriptions for than others, as this is from an 8-bit game from the 80s.

[03:02:49] <pyzozord> I want to write like if but that's more like a MUD in how world is open. More like skyrim or baldurs gate
[03:03:02] <kveroneau> My next goal is to make the ending, where the player will need to travel to each level and pick up the Triforce Piece, then shoot Ganon with that Silver arrow to finally save Zelda. :D
[03:03:15] <pyzozord> and have few ideas for systems I'd want to implement in such word
[03:03:27] <pyzozord> for example each npc would have thier own script/program
[03:03:42] <pyzozord> that would naturally make each npc unique and seem more alive
[03:03:53] <nomagno> I'm sure you can implement this with an existing IF engine
[03:03:59] <nomagno> But most have dumb limitations
[03:04:05] <kveroneau> pyzozord, I am actually wanting to turn all these descriptions into a real multiplayer MUSH that people could walk around in together and explore Hyrule from the orignal game together.
[03:04:07] <nomagno> Like memory or execution speed or file size

[03:09:58] <pyzozord> people are typing a lot these days, but I'm sure that's nothing compared to how much they click
[03:10:21] <kveroneau> Yeah, that would work.  I created an engine before that used a system that would translate well to the web, but it was too limiting.  The idea behind a text adventure is to have very limits other than the player's imagination.

[04:19:08] <droid3> This would help a ton to convert my video into slide shows for teaching purposes and not have to reduplicate teaching material
[04:20:00] <flakland> sounds like a video thumbnail generator
[04:20:44] <dre> I made something like this once lol 
[04:20:56] <droid3> i dont need a thumbnail or icon i need a program that will extract the different major frames in the video and put them in a slide show format.
[04:21:03] <dre> I got so sick of having to trawl through yt videos
[04:21:03] <droid3> dre and flakland
[04:21:26] <flakland> only differenc is major frame  vs thumbnail terminology
[04:21:44] <dre> so I made a program that watched yt, any major scene change would capture the screenshot, and it put the captions into the text ( and ran through some grammar checkers a couple of times ) 
[04:22:00] <droid3> well youtube is great for both teach/learning from and nothing better then a good movie to learn with.

[04:22:22] <dre> so it went from video presentation -> PDF document with photos, etc. anytime someone said "if you look at this" or something, it would have another screenshot. It was pretty darn cool imo. 
[04:22:33] <droid3> But if your doing it live or at a school videos are inferior to the slide show or writting on the board.
[04:22:46] <dre> but the yt downloading bit gave up the ghost and I can't be bothered to fix it really
[04:23:20] <flakland> i learn how to make battery from carbon metal and electrolyte on youtube last night, highly educational if you find the right video to watch, but some are too basic and void of information
[04:23:51] <droid3> actually if its more complex math or if your hand writting isnt the clearest its probably best to make slide shows for how your present to your students in my opinion
[04:24:47] <droid3> However a little of whiteboard/blackboard and slideshows are probably the best in person means to learn from as well as a good teach that can narrate/clearly speak the math topic.

[04:27:04] <droid3> If you got it in pdf format dre and flakland you can easily convert the pdf format to .odp or microsoft powerpoint format.
[04:27:38] <droid3> So that not my issue its just going from video to powerpoint/libreoffice impress format.
[04:28:36] <droid3> Now the other way around is simple aka make a video/audio of a presentation is just part of the features of microsoft powerpoint and libreoffice impress anyway.
[04:28:49] <droid3> So its really just going from video to presentation format for me.
[04:28:58] <droid3> Not going from presentation to video format.
[04:31:00] <droid3> well if there is no good software i know i can always dump the complete image sequence for the movie and select particular frames and rebuild a presentation.
[04:31:13] <droid3> Still alot fast then recreating the content from scratch.
[04:31:19] <droid3> So not all is lost.
[04:31:37] <flakland> write a program to decide what ismajor frame

[04:31:46] <droid3> But would be nice if you just push a button on a video and out pops your powerpoint presentation equivalent
[04:32:55] <droid3> flakland and there in lies the difficult problem deciding with a compute what frames are relevant. I suppose computer vision opencv lib could do this with AI hummmm ya maybe someday all think about how to do this more robustly
[04:33:16] <flakland> nah you don't need opencv
[04:33:23] <droid3> but what definitely be a cool feature to have/ a time save in making teaching material.
[04:33:33] <flakland> intel cpu alone is mighty fast
[04:34:10] <droid3> hummm its an interesting question yet to dive into writting it not so into at the moment
[04:34:25] <droid3> i just was more curious if it existed because it be a cool productivity tool
[04:34:31] <droid3> for teachers 
[04:35:08] <flakland> if it did exist as a serious project i would hope they include the subtitles as well

[09:28:06] <easyme> Is java good for desktop programming?
[09:28:38] <zaher_> easyme yes
[09:29:00] <JanC> depends on if you like Java really
[09:29:01] <easyme> Will java desktop executable be .jar?
[09:29:40] <jeaye> Could be. Could also be turned into an app image, native executable, or something else.
[09:30:05] <easyme> How can java executable be native .exe ?
[09:30:40] <jeaye> GraalVM can turn uberjars into native executables.
[09:31:04] <easyme> What is uberjars?
[09:31:09] <Twix> its not the concept of java to be a native executable. But there are java compilers which can create a native executable. E.g. the gnu compiler collection has a java compiler
[09:31:16] *** Joins: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc)
[09:31:29] <jeaye> easyme: Seems like you need to learn Java.
[09:31:43] <JanC> or maybe use whatever language you already know
[09:31:49] <jeaye> Or use something you're familiar with already. ^
[09:32:16] <easyme> I know C++, Java.
[09:32:27] <pulse> I find C# a lot less annoying than Java personally
[09:32:56] <jeaye> easyme: Either or those will work for desktop programming.
[09:32:57] <Twix> but C# is quite a windows centric thing
[09:33:22] <jeaye> C# is more annoying to set up on GNU/Linux, but the language is arguably more enjoyable than Java.
[09:33:54] <Twix> yes, could be true. But i would choose something different if i want to be portable or target linux
[09:34:10] <jeaye> easyme: If you know C++, Qt is a hugely popular framework for making cross-platform desktop apps.
[09:34:27] <jeaye> Though a lot of people say they "know" C++ and it never means the same thing.
[09:34:34] <Twix> or gtk(which is C,  but there is a C++ wrapper)
[09:34:47] <JanC> I think C# for linux desktop programming isn't particularly useful nowadays, as parts of Mono, and MonoDevelop, are essentially unmaintained nowadays?
[09:35:13] * jeaye shrugs.
[09:36:33] <pulse> And now you know why Electron is so popular for desktop apps nowadays
[09:36:44] <Twix> i hate it
[09:36:52] <JanC> ugh
[09:36:55] <jeaye> pulse: Yep.
[09:36:56] <pulse> Literally easier to bundle Chrome and a webapp than deal with the dinosaur hair that are other options
[09:37:10] <jeaye> And your app can work on the web, too.
[09:37:12] <JanC> "popular" with some companies, yes, hardly popular with their users
[09:37:27] <jeaye> JanC: The people in this channel are not typical users.
[09:37:34] <pulse> Yeah, was about to write the same, lol
[09:37:39] <pulse> 99.9% of users are not power users
[09:37:44] <pulse> They couldn't care less
[09:37:47] <jeaye> The masses don't give a shit if Discord uses Electron or something more native.
[09:37:53] <jeaye> They don't know the difference.
[09:37:59] <JanC> oh yes they care
[09:38:07] <JanC> it's bloated & slow
[09:38:11] <easyme> pulse: What is power user?
[09:38:16] <pulse> JanC, VSCode is pretty damn fast
[09:38:23] <Twix> electron is hardly useable for me. It omnomnoms the ram. The last electron app, which i tried, failed. It had a exectuable stack and my os does not allow this(and i think it is right)
[09:38:28] <pulse> easyme, Someone who understands computers and software on a high level
[09:38:38] <pulse> Someone who can use the terminal effectively, typically
[09:38:46] <jeaye> Discord is as fast as it needs to be to be hugely successful.
[09:38:56] <pulse> Twix, Oh I'm not a fan either, but I understand why it's a popular option
[09:39:57] <JanC> last time I looked VSCode was way slower than similar native IDEs, and used lots more RAM (especially if you don't restart them often)
[09:40:01] <Twix> i understand it, too. But i think that the main cause might be, that most developers today can do java script(or one of its variants)
[09:40:06] <pulse> I do CSS all day long trust me if I could avoid it I would translate 360 degrees and run away
[09:40:20] <pulse> So using it for desktop apps is ugh... a weird idea to say the least
[09:40:31] <pulse> But it does work, and it's arguably far more expressive as far UX goes
[09:41:22] <pulse> The old paradigm of UI on desktop has to evolve at some point
[09:41:57] <JanC> non-native user interfaces are almost always annoying to use also
[09:42:22] * jeaye checks and sees Discord is using 222MB RAM. That's 11 servers, over 100 channels.
[09:42:38] <jeaye> On a desktop, these days, it's negligible.

[09:49:57] <pulse> But the truth is, if you want an expressive, modern, somewhat experimental and interesting, UX that isn't tied to the paradigms of 20 years ago, you use Electron because there's nothing better
[09:50:05] <JanC> I suppose in part it's because many Electron-based apps were written by people who are not used to programming long-running processes...
[09:50:31] <pulse> The amount of hacks you need to make Qt or win32 or wxwidgets or Java or w/e do what Electron can do in a few lines of code is disgusting
[09:50:49] <pulse> That's really the main selling point for me
[09:51:07] <pulse> I wish a C++ framework pops up with similar power someday
[09:52:48] <pulse> Just styling a custom button in a weird way takes you forever in these old frameworks
[09:52:57] <pulse> You can do any kind of a button in CSS with almost no effort
[09:53:08] <pulse> And that's just a button
[09:53:15] <jeaye> I've worked on an app which was simultanesouly deployed to web, Overwolf, and Electron with a single script. That's web, mobile web, Windows, macOS, and GNU/Linux. And the whole code was in ClojureScript. If I wanted that sort of portability without Electron, I'd be stuck with a shittier language (to me), maybe fighting with Qt lang bindings, and trying to get Qt to compile for web, or maybe
[09:53:17] <jeaye> Xamarin and locked into the Windows world.
[09:53:27] <Twix> you can give css to gtk and qt to tell them how to style your button
[09:53:29] <Twix> ...
[09:53:32] <pulse> Yeah, that's another benefit
[09:53:44] <pulse> Twix, GTK is beyond buggy, and I can't stand Qt
[09:53:50] <Twix> :D
[09:53:55] <pulse> But Qt at least works well. GTK is just a bunch of cobbled up bugs

[09:54:39] <Twix> i like simple user interfaces. I do not need fancy buttons. I usually do not need buttons at all
[09:54:44] <pulse> wxWidgets is the least terrible traditional option for crossplatform in my view
[09:54:47] <leduyquang753> The old frameworks just didn't have the intention to make buttons able to be customized into a million styles.
[09:55:23] <pulse> That's not a good argument. I'm a game developer and as such, interesting UI is somewhat a priority
[09:55:35] <pulse> If all you need is some boring accounting app then sure, traditional systems are great
[09:55:52] <pulse> If you want to do Discord-type of UX that attracts the new generation, good luck
[09:56:03] <leduyquang753> People haven't made many games using Win32 do they.
[09:56:11] <leduyquang753> It's not made for games either.
[09:56:11] <JanC> desktop toolkits aren't intended to be used for games, of course
[09:56:18] <pulse> I actually love win32 games, but mostly for nostalgia. Lol
[09:56:24] <pulse> There's a ton of them leduyquang753

[09:57:07] <pulse> They peaked in 90s
[09:58:30] <leduyquang753> All the Win32 games I came across just use the default styles for their dialogs.
[09:58:39] <pulse> Yeah, mostly
[09:58:44] <pulse> Some of them go overboard
[09:58:52] <pulse> It's not like you can't use win32 in a completely unique way

[13:52:17] <mrig> I find the database schema to be a lot of fun, wish in a way that I had a language that simplified making the GUI part of it by not abstracting it quite so far away.
[13:52:46] <mrig> using web as a front end really is messy right now :|

[13:57:30] <d3x0r> go's lack of type information kinda sucked... couldn't cast to a generic interface to just use it
[13:57:31] <ent53> On a scale of 1 - 10, how much of a cluster is modern JS, because I barely have any experience with it
[13:57:53] <d3x0r> ent somewhere between 9 and 11 I think
[13:58:22] <d3x0r> Unfortunatly they remained backwards compatible, and all the old examples and samples are still out there, so it's hard to know what the least clustery way is to do things

[14:38:59] <deniska> mrig: kinda the opposite, web people complain that webassembly is kinda its own thing not integrated in a web browser enough :)
[14:39:05] <mrig> deniska right yes, I think pyzozord's alluding to the same.
[14:39:26] <arahael> deniska: web people don't know what they're talking about. :)
[14:39:27] <mrig> deniska does seem intriguing.
[14:40:20] <mrig> Nor do the birds, but it does not stop them from chirping! :D
[14:40:26] <pyzozord> webassembly is great, just because it has potential to become the universal bytecode
[14:40:43] <arahael> How does one run webassembly on the command line, I'm finding it surprisingly tricky to google that.
[14:40:49] * mrig hopes that he has not offended any parrots here present.
[14:40:50] <pyzozord> not sure about the technology though, I never really looked at the webassembly. I should learn it
[14:42:04] <pyzozord> arahael I don't think you can run just web assembly, it doesn't have io

[22:57:45] <ThreeOfLife> Hi! Any numpy guys here? I am trying to generate a numpy array of random cords like [[0, 1], [1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, -1]], but I am currently stuck at also getting [-1, -1] etc when trying with numpy's randint. Suggestions? I also tried choice, but that only works with 1d arrays.
[22:58:59] <yin> do we spell daemonized or daemonised?
[23:00:17] <pyzozord> I wanna say daemonized, looks more natural to me

[23:10:51] <corn266> ThreeOfLife so rand can work for the use case that you have provided so far but you state that it hasn't. what explicitly will meet your use case? something like np.round(np.random.rand(4,2) * 2 - 1).astype('int') ?
