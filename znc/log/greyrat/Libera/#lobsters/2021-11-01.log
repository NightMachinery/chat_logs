[00:13:49] <riv> I need a name for this thing..
[00:13:59] <riv> so you implement a web application and test it localhost, it works great
[00:14:14] <riv> now you want to run it behind a reverse proxy under the url localhost/wiki/
[00:14:30] <riv> so now i have to add /wiki/ to the links in the web app code
[00:14:44] <riv> what's the name for that? (anyone even know what i am referring to)
[00:14:49] <riv> hope it made sense
[00:14:50] <kline> i know what you mean

[00:14:55] <jj5> I call it URL_BASE
[00:14:57] <kline> you need to host a service not at the root but at a subdirectory
[00:15:12] <kline> how you do this varies by reverse proxy and framework
[00:15:17] <kline> good luck
[00:15:25] <riv> URL_BASE is good, i was calling it deployment path
[00:15:38] <riv> but surely this has a commonly accepted term that everyone calls it?
[00:15:50] <jj5> riv: one trick is to make it include the trailing slash, so you can make it / if you want
[00:16:02] <kline> i dont think theres a single agreed upon name
[00:16:12] <riv> i had to put the trailing slash in nginx config yeah

[00:16:43] <riv> maybe base url is it

[00:17:07] <riv> wiki.localhost/
[00:17:17] <riv> maybe i should have just done that instead
[00:17:41] <jj5> also this is the path to your front-controller if you implement that pattern
[00:17:58] <jj5> riv: what web server and programming language are you using?
[00:18:07] <riv> im using nginx and golang

[01:15:51] <atw> riv, amazigh: I think I get it. riv, you were saying that you encoded false as 0 so that if is just jump-on-zero. I think that's what the "temptation" of encoding nil as 0 is. Versus the "explicit NIL compare": one ask "is this value equal to the encoding of nil?", push that result, then jump appropriately.
[01:16:13] <riv> yep

[01:22:08] <atw> so you can either (a) unmask every time you want to deref a pointer to a cons, or (b) do an extra step for a conditional. sectorlisp's authors opted for (b), which may be an unusual choice. Maybe that's because sectorlisp has only atoms and conses, whereas most other lisps usually have a few more types?

[22:13:21] <shapr> ah fair enough
[22:13:35] <companion_cube> it's definitely the reputation
[22:13:41] <companion_cube> but then so is the reputation of C programmers
[22:13:43] <companion_cube> esp. on IRC
[22:14:19] <shapr> yeah, reputation isn't always reality :-/
[22:14:27] <shapr> but then there's often some truth to the stereotypes
[22:14:46] <shapr> First time I was looking for Haskell jobs I was repeatedly asked where I got my PhD
[22:14:54] <shapr> that convinced me to go back to uni and finish a bachelor's degree

[22:50:11] <shapr> for that reason /ignore is never a community benefit
[22:50:36] <technomancy> haha I literally have the person who posted that on /ignore in #emacs
[22:50:54] <technomancy> it's a critical workaround for mods who refuse to act on abusers
[22:51:16] <technomancy> but yeah obviously active mods would be a better solution

[22:56:09] <jjuran> The problem with /ignore is that it doesn't stop peopple from being abusive, but just means that now you don't know about it
[22:56:49] *** Quits: busfahrer (~busfahrer@94.134.93.10) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[22:56:54] <mockturtle> which is not POSIX [unix programming] (majjoha) https://lobste.rs/s/9n4hbn
[22:57:17] <jjuran> Far better would be if /ignore happened on the client side, and messages from the ignored would display in very low contrast, so you actually can ignore them if you want, but you can read them if necessary

[23:00:10] <technomancy> I mean, /ignore *does* happen on the client side??
[23:00:29] <gerikson> just need a UI tweak to "show" them
[23:00:35] <technomancy> doesn't it?
[23:01:06] <technomancy> yeah, it does on my client
[23:01:13] <jjuran> Oh, does it?  I have no idea.  My point is that, as is, it allows people to be abusive to you in front of others.
[23:01:45] <technomancy> there is also an "add-fool" command which does what you described by making it less noticeable
[23:01:46] <mouseghost> it does..
[23:01:49] <gerikson> it's no substitute for moderation

[23:03:18] <jjuran> My point is that /ignore may be suitable for someone posts irrelevant things that aren't directed at anyone, but if someone's being hurtful, it's best to know about it.
