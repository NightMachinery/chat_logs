[16:28:20] <libc> emanuele6: :)
[16:28:34] <libc> ma man
[16:30:45] <libc> what is the effect of n command ?
[16:31:16] <libc> i tried sed -i '/cat/n' sedtest
[16:31:22] <libc> i tried sed -n '/cat/n' sedtest
[16:31:34] <libc> but it does nothing i expected it to replace the line starting with cat with the line after it
[16:37:33] <Soliton> n reads in the next line. it does not replace anything.
[16:38:01] <Soliton> btw, you're matching cat anywhere in the line not just at the start.
[16:38:27] <libc> thanks
[16:38:48] <libc> so when it comes to the line with cat it basically skip it ?
[16:38:55] <Soliton> if you want to delete the line that matches you can use the d command.
[16:39:31] <Soliton> no it reads in the next line and continues normal processing.
[16:40:16] <libc> Soliton: what do you mean reads in ? in the doc it says replacing
[16:40:40] <libc> replacing == substituting == deleting old and replace with new data 
[16:40:53] <libc> or i wrong 
[16:40:55] <Soliton> what doc is that?
[16:41:00] <libc> info sed
[16:41:20] <Soliton> so read the part before that as well.
[16:42:20] <Soliton> it prints the pattern space (usually the current line) and then replaces it with the next line.
[16:43:08] <libc> right
[16:43:11] <Soliton> so if you don't do anything else it does the same thing as it does by default anyway.
[16:43:19] <libc> so sed -n '/cat/n' file
[16:43:34] <libc> should output the second line ( giving the file have only two lines which the first have cat in it )
[16:43:41] <libc> and it doesnt'
[16:43:43] <Soliton> no, -n disables auto-print.
[16:44:02] <libc> right but replacement is taking place anyway
[16:44:14] <Soliton> sure and nothing is printed.
[16:46:32] <libc> ok it's clearer with this sed -n '/cat/n;p' sedtest
[16:50:46] <libc> thanks Soliton 
[16:57:21] <Soliton> you're welcome.

[19:07:28] <libc> what's the difference between R and r command ?
[19:14:37] <Soliton> R reads a single line at a time.
[19:15:54] <e36freak> yeah, r reads the entirety of the file
[19:17:29] <libc> what `at a time` means in this context /
[19:17:31] <libc> ?
[19:18:50] <libc> i have a file with two lines
[19:18:56] <libc> called sedread
[19:19:15] <libc> sed '/cat/R seedread' sedtest
[19:19:26] <libc> after the cat line only the first line in sedread is entered
[19:19:33] <libc> the second line never reads
[19:19:45] <Soliton> since R is never called again.
[19:20:22] <Soliton> # printf '%s\n' {1..9} > file; sed /foo/Rfile <<< $'foo\nbar\nfoo\nbaz\nfoo' | paste -s
[19:20:23] <shbot> Soliton: foo     1       bar     foo     2       baz     foo     3
[19:24:42] <libc> right
[19:24:44] <libc> thakns again
[19:24:58] <libc> for some reason i still useed the regex /cat/
[19:25:24] <libc> why i always getting smarter after posting a question in irc ?
[19:25:45] <libc> is this a rite of passage or lack of research ?

[23:24:04] <libc> not using python wrongly
[23:24:08] <libc> would be a good start
[23:26:03] <libc> you dont
[23:26:05] <libc> simply put
[23:26:22] <libc> it's easier within your own python code
