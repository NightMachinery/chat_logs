[00:01:42] <l__q> It loaded! Thanks!
[00:02:59] <l__q> FunkyBob: Mayby you know, how to remove starting commas in my object loop?
[00:03:41] <FunkyBob> you mean in producing the textarea content?
[00:04:21] <l__q> Yes, but only the starting commad, not commas in values
[00:04:32] <l__q> commas*
[00:04:58] <FunkyBob> Object.entries(example).map(([key, value]) => `${key} ${value};`).join('\n')
[00:05:07] <l__q> Yes
[00:05:08] <FunkyBob> odd that you used entries() but did the lookup anyway for the value
[00:07:19] <l__q> FunkyBob: It add commas
[00:07:30] <FunkyBob> my version doesn't
[00:07:32] <l__q> Im try you example, but it add commas
[00:07:42] <l__q> Object.entries(example).map(([key, value]) => `${key} ${value};`).join('\n')
[00:07:46] <l__q> add commas

[04:04:11] <trafficjam> nbjoerg: they have icons which have a border slighty darker than their background color
[04:04:27] <nbjoerg> maybe show a pic :)
[04:04:28] <trafficjam> e.g. white app icons have a grey border, light blue app icons will have a darker blue for the border, etc
[04:04:32] <trafficjam> ok one sec
[04:06:14] <trafficjam> not the best quality but the first i could find -> https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/app-store-get-apps.jpg?quality=82&strip=all
[04:06:25] <matsaman> trafficjam: there are huge writeups on this matter
[04:06:28] <stenno> probably with gradient borders or clip-path with gradients.
[04:06:36] <matsaman> trafficjam: but you don't really need to do it just as apple does to have almost as good for cheaper
[04:06:53] <nbjoerg> I would just do it in the icon svg :)
[04:07:20] <trafficjam> i've been using border-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.05), but it doesn't really work
[04:07:34] <trafficjam> stenno: cool, i'll research that
[04:09:29] <stenno> box-shadow too
[04:12:34] <trafficjam> hmm any idea which combination exactly?
[04:12:44] <trafficjam> box-shadow doesn't seem to be it, tried normal and inset
[04:14:59] <pavonia> I think this is just a background gradient
[04:15:56] <trafficjam> pavonia: the parent div in <div><image w='64px' h='64px'></div> has a background gradient?
[04:16:30] <pavonia> Well, which icon are you referring to?
[04:18:18] <trafficjam> pavonia: the icons in https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/app-store-get-apps.jpg?quality=82&strip=all, where icons with a white background have a grey border, and icons with a colored background have a border of that same color but slightly darker
[04:20:19] <pavonia> I don't see a border in some of the icons, tbh

[06:09:53] <hmw[at]> What are even the effects of display:contents; ? I looked it up on MDN and it says, it is only for removing it from the accessibility tree, i.e. it looks like it shouldn't even have visible effects.

[06:10:33] <FunkyBob> hmw[at]: in this case, it means the grid layout works on the children of the element, not the element itself
