[13:06:15] <PapuaHardyNet> wut
[13:20:33] <Gurkenglas> How should I buy a selection of small samples of complete food so I know which kind to buy more of?
[13:21:21] <ivan> Gurkenglas: try a good asian market, maybe a korean store or something
[13:22:17] <ivan> kind of a weird question if you're not consuming snack food
[13:22:44] <ivan> what do you eat now?
[13:23:01] <Gurkenglas> whatever my mother puts on the table
[13:24:01] <ivan> Gurkenglas: are you in a location where plants grow well
[13:24:17] <ivan> or in an icy place where people eat only meat
[13:24:54] <Gurkenglas> ivan, um, by "complete food" I meant, like, powders that you use to turn little time per day into not worrying about food or its health effects
[13:25:06] <Gurkenglas> (because they claim to have what one needs)
[13:25:17] <ivan> that's a scam bro
[13:26:01] <saturn2> ask your mother how to make food
[13:26:30] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, no that does not sound that will save me time *or* make me comfortable with the probability that i have some kind of deficiency
[13:27:43] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: why not take a blood test for micronutrient levels
[13:27:50] <ivan> tofu, bok choy, zucchini, eggplant, cucumber, potatoes, (good) tomatoes, green peas (lots of them), nuts (cashews, pistachios), squash, bananas, plantain, whatever fruit you have
[13:28:13] <PapuaHardyNet> if you have any deficiencies right now, you can fix it with minimum action
[13:28:17] <Gurkenglas> ivan, i've heard good things from the general LW bubble, though actually trying to purchase some does look like the market is, uh, harmed by the vulnerability of the whole idea to scams
[13:29:12] <ivan> you may have farmers in your area or better stores that get deliveries from them
[13:29:47] <ivan> they're more on facebook if you need to mine for them
[13:30:05] <Gurkenglas> i dont think im gonna keep investing hours per week into nutrition. i might invest a few smart hours a year though!
[13:30:13] <saturn2> given what i know about Gurkenglas it's going to take a lot of work to talk him out of the powdered meal idea
[13:31:02] <saturn2> everyone has to make their own mistakes i guess
[13:31:22] *** Quits: edef (~edef@user/edef) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[13:31:24] <Gurkenglas> Good guess. It's been floating around in my head for years. What's the reason you believe you can't just mix up all the necessary stuff?
[13:31:55] <ivan> it's not lindy and you don't know what you're eating
[13:32:06] <Gurkenglas> yeah but the same argument goes for pills
[13:32:14] <ivan> pills usually have lab tests
[13:32:20] <Gurkenglas> so give me food with lab tests
[13:32:29] <adiabonkers> pills to supplement one or two things are more lindy than Ensure and Soylent
[13:32:35] <ivan> have you considered just not reinventing eating
[13:32:37] <saturn2> it's physically possible of course but humans are too evil and dumb to make it happen right now
[13:32:45] <ivan> hahaha
[13:33:19] <Gurkenglas> only takes one company of humans and one community that knows them, right?
[13:33:37] *** Quits: adiabonkers (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:34:13] <saturn2> the LW community is terrible at policing its members
[13:34:50] <saturn2> like unusually terrible, worse than normies
[13:37:09] <Gurkenglas> doesn't need to police the members, right? kickstart a complete food, labtest a random .01% of packets, fire everyone if it's just >50% garbage
[13:46:21] <Gurkenglas> ivan, "not reinvent food" that's like not reinventing sleep or posture or charity or exercise or thinking or any of the other critical processes!
[13:47:06] <PapuaHardyNet> you cannot "reinvent" core physiological processes
[13:47:29] <saturn2> it's not just a matter of testing for the presence or absence of things, you need to do trustworthy original research

[13:48:21] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: why not start a research project to validate whether theoretically a person can live on healthily and indefinitely on powdered meals?
[13:48:44] <rmmh> saturn2: geek social fallacy #1 ?
[13:48:54] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, where is "give only it to a mouse and see how it fares" on that spectrum
[13:49:38] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, busy writing an interpretability library :P
[13:50:03] <saturn2> Gurkenglas: it's a very easy preliminary part
[13:50:13] <rmmh> Gurkenglas: you can find reviews for soylent powders and equivalents on reddit rather easily
[13:50:53] <rmmh> a lot of them are US-based, I don't know about european availability
[13:50:54] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, would it rule out the, i dunno, 90% of complete foods that are less healthy than average food and rule in the 10% that are healthier than average food?
[13:51:12] <saturn2> rmmh: that's part of it but mostly it's a tendency to conflate speaking the lingo and having interesting ideas with being trustworthy and having compatible goals
[13:52:02] <rmmh> saturn2: excessively niche groups probably want new members more strongly than more common groups
[13:53:36] <saturn2> Gurkenglas: that's not good enough if you want to reduce the probability of getting a deficiency compared to eating like a normal person
[13:54:03] <rmmh> I doubt there's that much risk of deficiencies if you take it as a supplement
[13:54:25] <rmmh> if you drink soylent 6 days a week and go eat at a restaurant one day, you'll probably be fine
[13:54:34] <rmmh> (by supplement I mean "not 100%")
[13:54:38] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, don't i cover that by seeing whether the mouse gets the deficiency?
[13:54:53] <rmmh> mice don't get scurvy
[13:54:58] <saturn2> mice aren't humans
[13:54:59] <Gurkenglas> oh, okay.
[13:55:24] <Gurkenglas> too bad. uhhhh is anyone looking into mice that get scurvy
[13:55:27] <rmmh> there are monkeys that are _better_ animal models for human nutrition but monkeys are waaay more expensive to use for testing
[13:55:30] <saturn2> humans live like twice as long as expected by their size
[13:55:34] <rmmh> yes, they're called guinea pigs
[13:55:54] <saturn2> animals just aren't all the same
[13:56:19] <rmmh> famously, the low-fat craze was supported by a study that found rabbits did poorly on high-fat diets
[13:57:24] <rmmh> animal testing is probably better to discover *toxicity* than optimal diets
[13:57:30] <saturn2> we haven't been evolving independently just on the outside
[13:57:38] <Gurkenglas> Hmm. Genetic engineering might make lab animals that predict effects on humans better, but it'd take long to establish this, and then you still might not get, like, effects on mental stuff that we don't want in lab animals
[13:57:38] <rmmh> rats aren't immune to many toxins that humans aren't, etc etc
[13:58:13] <rmmh> so you can generally expect that something that kills a rat will kill a human too, with an unknown dose
[13:59:48] <Gurkenglas> maybe the problem is that powders add things until we hope we have everything, when we should be removing unnecessary parts
[14:00:08] <Gurkenglas> so put regular food in a blender, dry that, then add known-safe things until it's palatable?
[14:00:27] <rmmh> nice, you've invented baby food!
[14:00:46] <Gurkenglas> or does food contain too many things that are destroyed by such a process
[14:00:57] <rmmh> just you know, texture
[14:01:09] <rmmh> heterogeneity
[14:02:44] <saturn2> i've read that not chewing enough can cause IQ loss and dementia
[14:03:15] <Gurkenglas> i defy the data. correlation/causation confusion?
[14:03:19] <rmmh> maybe the real soyboys were the lazy eaters we met along the way
[14:03:49] <rsaarelm> Wouldn't there be medical research  about intravenous feeding, people who can't chew and need to be on some liquid diet and whatever that's already looked into just what kind of stuff needs to go to the simplified food stuff and what happens with people who are on it long term because they have no choice?
[14:04:22] <rmmh> rsaarelm: sure, and we clearly have some recipes that are "decent"
[14:04:25] <rsaarelm> Are there people whose GI tract is permanently out of commission but who have survived for years on IV feeding?
[14:04:30] <saturn2> it's common knowledge that intensive hospital care fucks you up
[14:04:46] <rsaarelm> Yeah, there's probably lots of confounds on people in situations like that.

[14:05:19] <rsaarelm> At least your mouth can be messed up by some physical injury that doesn't incapacitate you that much otherwise.
[14:05:38] <rmmh> if I had crohn's disease I would 100% try a carnivore diet

[14:10:19] <rmmh> go look for accounts of people on liquid diets to see how much they enjoy food slurries
[14:11:09] <Gurkenglas> like, old people?
[14:11:17] <rmmh> lots of dental procedures
[14:11:51] <Gurkenglas> i was pointing out that i expect everyone to go there eventually when they're old enough, so we might as well make it tolerable :P
[14:12:14] <rmmh> eh? most seniors keep chewing to the end
[14:12:42] <rmmh> maybe a bit softer foods but people really like chewing their food
[14:14:42] <Gurkenglas> fineeee i guess we can nicely coagulate the slurry, how hard can it be *steps on rake*
[14:15:10] <rmmh> if you look at the successful flavors of meal replacement shakes
[14:15:37] <rmmh> there are precious few savory ones-- they're almost all milkshake or fruit smoothie flavors
[14:16:07] <rmmh> because 1) people love sugar and 2) desserts in liquid form are more acceptable, somehow
[14:16:09] <Gurkenglas> yeah okay they probably went as far as reasonably possible to make the slurrys enjoyable to consume, all that's unoptimized is the actual healthiness
[14:16:29] <rmmh> flavor is almost entirely orthogonal to ingredients though
[14:16:47] <rmmh> like, you might have some mineral taste from the stuff, or a slight taste of whatever grain they use
[14:17:00] <rmmh> but it's easy to overpower with a flavoring

[20:29:18] <pompolic> i like grapes
[20:29:25] <pompolic> i don't eat grapes to own the health nuts

[20:29:57] <pompolic> joking
[20:30:04] <two2thehead> ah :V
[20:30:21] <pompolic> if i were to be serious i'd point out that nutrition science can't make up its mind
[20:30:23] <nshepperd2> cookies aren't that convenient imo
[20:30:28] <nshepperd2> crumbs go everywhere
[20:30:59] <pompolic> and the footsoldiers are just way too overconfident about whatever pet hypothesis they had read at the time they became footsoldiers
[20:31:14] <two2thehead> yep
[20:31:30] <pompolic> i would also point out that fruits contain a lot of sugar, so it doesn't feel like you'd be much further ahead
[20:32:22] <two2thehead> absolutely, I'm just working on baby steps here
[20:32:49] <pompolic> incremental improvements are good, actually
[20:33:50] <pompolic> i'm just airing my skepticism at people who have very strong sacredness-based opinions about food (ie offtopic)

[20:38:52] <pompolic> comparing the taste profile of fruit and more processed things like cookies, somehow fruit is the one where i go "this is too sugary" more often
[20:39:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: I have in my kitchen right now like two lbs. grapes that have that flaw
[20:39:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's why I'm googling "grape jam" as we speak
[20:39:38] <pompolic> when life gives you lemons... er, seeded grapes
[20:40:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> ANyway, as for that "revealed preferences photo... look. Fruits are cool. In fact, a good fruit is probably tastier than the lame, cheap, way-too-sweet, hydrogenate-soybean-oil-filled excuses for cookies that a place like that serves. BUT.
[20:40:38] <pompolic> oh yeah, speaking of convenient shapes: my go-to grocery store sells grapes in these small paper bags. pretty sure it's a marketing ploy to associate it with freshness or something like that
[20:40:49] <pompolic> but that sure is inconvenient to carry out of the store
[20:41:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> First of all, the apples they got are likely shitty cultivars. The pears are likely watery, tasteless, and rock-hard. The bananas are probably underripe... and anyway bananas eaten plain are kind of meh. (And what do you do with the peel? While sitting in your seat in the audience?)
[20:41:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> two2thehead is right for once - the fruits in this case are way less convenient to eat
[20:42:18] <pompolic> if only everything came in uniformly sized boxes (i am completely serious about this one)
