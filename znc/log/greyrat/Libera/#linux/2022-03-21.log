[04:24:06] <codebam> the new user I created has working sound though. how can I delete the config?
[04:24:08] <matsaman> it's a TRAP
[04:24:35] <ornxka> but instead it relies on the source file for the entire duration of its execution

[04:33:24] <crashrep> in conclusion, the best way to alleviate the bash script reading behavior is to fork linux :P
[04:33:51] <crashrep> or, you could try replacing /bin/bash etc. with another program which copies the script to a tmp file and executes that (i'm sure this won't have any unintended consequences at all)
[04:34:02] <matsaman> I think Suicide Linux will probably sort it out
[04:34:55] <phogg> crashrep: "fork bash" is a much easier solution
[04:35:12] <matsaman> fork the bombs
[04:35:31] <codebam> I think it was ~/.local/state/pipewire so I removed that but it's still searching
[04:35:56] <matsaman> I think you mean ~/.local/russia/, comrade
[04:36:25] * rbox sticks a fork in phogg 
[04:36:49] <phogg> copying the whole script somewhere else and executing that works, but it suffers from the need to make a copy, so you must have somewhere to write to. Your script might also be very large.
[04:37:10] *** Joins: RedPanda (~Redwolf@user/redwolf)
[04:37:12] <phogg> in specific cases you can wave away these as non-issues, but it's hard to do that in the general case
[04:37:25] * phogg has executed 800MiB "shell scripts" before
[04:37:37] <phogg> .run files packed with a tarball, but still
[04:38:10] <crashrep> could do something like this (WARNING DO NOT ACTUALLY USE THIS) https://bpa.st/DWUA
[04:38:17] <codebam> why use curl when you can encode with base64
[04:38:43] <Th|ef> likes shell scripts aswell
[04:38:54] <phogg> alternately, you could change how the shell works (at the cost of performance and some corner cases) to make it parse the entire file before executing any of it, but then makeself-style .run files stop working at all. You'd have to special case noticing when the file *should* end somehow.

[05:22:28] <Dagmar> Oh wait... i and a too
[05:22:38] <rascul> Jong what reasons? i don't know what you're referring to
[05:22:55] <rascul> vimtutor is the standard way of learning the basics of vim
[05:23:09] <silverdust> Hi, when I echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z')" I expect the %z timezone to be like -05:00 but instead its without the : delimeter and is just -0500
[05:23:21] <rascul> putting random words in a sentence with "vim" doesn't automatically make it sensical
[05:23:28] <silverdust> Is there a format to get it with the : delimeter?
[05:23:37] <rbox> silverdust: well doing that is stupid... just call date
[05:23:42] <rbox> echo $(date) is pointless
[05:23:44] <Dagmar> silverdust: If it's not listed in the man page for `date` then no
[05:23:56] <rbox> silverdust: the man page explains all the modifiers date can take
[05:23:59] <Dagmar> In any case there should not be a colon there.
[05:24:25] <Jong> rascul I don't know what "vimtutor" is. What are you referring to? A website? A series of youtube videos? A software program?

[05:24:38] <Dagmar> You should _really_ be sticking to the built-in formats
[05:25:02] <Dagmar> For one, it becomes orders of magnitude more complex to do anything with a time once you've converted it away from epoch
[05:25:08] <rascul> Jong vimtutor is a command, it should come with any vim installation
[05:25:10] <silverdust> I generate the date into a file that ends up being parsed by Javascript and it errors without the colon

[05:26:24] <Dagmar> silverdust: Again, parsing times becomes orders of magnitude more complex once you convert to something that's not epoch seconds.  This is one of the reasons.

[05:26:46] <rascul> if you're converting it to anything else then i hope it's only for display purposes
[05:26:55] <Jong> rascul  I just typed vimtutor and I'm now reading through it! I'm excited
[05:27:24] <silverdust> I would but this is for a generator script where users can optionally enter the time by hand. So the goal is to still make people able to write date like 2022-03-20T20:56:48-05:00 . With epoch they'd have to generate it somewhere
[05:27:37] <Jong> What about keyboard layout? I use qwerty. s it worth it to switch to the other one for faster coding?
[05:27:52] <Dagmar> silverdust: Don't invent your own format for input data
[05:27:55] <Jong> has anyone here tried dvorak?
[05:28:07] <rascul> so you should use a library that includes that functionality to parse freehand time formats because if you try to do it yourself you're going to fail

[06:09:06] <Xgates> Anyone using PCManFM know if there's a way to increase the padding between folders, files, etc..? Here's a directory as an example I'm looking through, and everything is so bloody crammed together that the names are cut off at the end;
[06:09:08] <Xgates> https://ibb.co/74L0QBt
[06:09:48] <Dagmar> Increasing the padding will not make more room for the filenames

[06:10:40] <rascul> changing from icon view to a list view can be beneficial if you want to see the whole filenames
[06:10:48] <rascul> might need to resize a column though
[06:11:07] <Xgates> padding might not be the correct choice of wording here, I'm only wondering if the Grid layout can be changed, so there's more space between, and not so crammed together...
[06:11:23] <Xgates> I just can't believe PCManFM has this bad of a layout and cuts the names off too...
[06:11:37] <Dagmar> The layout is fine.
[06:11:41] <Dagmar> You're the one using grid.
[06:11:51] <rascul> names get cut off in every file manager
[06:12:00] <Dagmar> What you need is for the _cells_ to be larger
[06:12:17] <Xgates> If the layout was fine, then the names shouldn't be getting cut off at the end, you should be able to read the entire name of a file, folder, etc...
[06:12:18] <rascul> that's what happens when you try to fit a string longer than x into a field which only holds xc
[06:12:19] <Dagmar> ...or for your fonts to be smaller, or your filenames _shorter_

[06:13:24] <rascul> every file manager does it
[06:13:30] <Xgates> I understand what you are trying to point out, but use other file managers and you will see this is not the same behaviour...
[06:13:51] <Dagmar> I'm looking at it in two different file managers right this second
[06:13:52] <rascul> perhaps you just havent hit that specific behavior because you've only used other file managers to browse directories that contain files with names that can fit in the fiels

[06:56:12] <Dagmar> If you write the software to prefer ipv6, yes

[08:11:20] <ChetManly> so when you use a UEFI system you dont need grub anymore?
[08:11:39] <rbox> if you choose yes, you can put a uefi wrapper on a kernel and have ti boot the kernel diretcly
[08:11:47] <ChetManly> it just boot from the EFI (esp) partition

[08:13:01] <ChetManly> so grub would still be installed at the beginning of whatever the bootable disk was

[14:59:31] <phogg> letalis: the short answer is yes, the long answer is "it might be complicated" depending on how your partitions are set up
[14:59:34] <belzurix> it's only shrinking that requires LVM, right?

[15:00:04] <letalis> i think it would be easier on windows right? since it has the disk management app
[15:00:13] <letalis> and i could shrink the windows partition there and expand the linux one?
[15:00:26] <peetaur> letalis: ends of partitions are easy to move around if the fs is resizable (unlike XFS which can grow but not shrink); starts are harder to move....need to move lots of data around
[15:00:50] <phogg> if you have two partitions that 100% fill the disk and it's Windows-then-Linux you will need to (a) shrink the Windows filesystem, (b) resize the Windows partition down, (c) move the start of the Linux partition left, (d) move the start of the Linux filesystem left. gparted can do all of this, but this is the most complicated scenario.

[15:01:25] <phogg> the best case scenario is that your Linux partition is the last one on the disk and there is nothing after it, then you can just increase the partition size, increase the filesystem size, and done. Don't even need to reboot for that one.
[15:01:25] <letalis> ok so i'm not sure what start/end of partition/filesystem is :)
[15:01:31] <letalis> but i think i'll figure it out
[15:01:35] <belzurix> windows cannot really touch non-windows partitions so you prolly need both windows to shrink and and a live distro for growing the linux partition

[16:44:23] <gurkenglas> Is there a tool that'll compress a file into a program that reproduces that file under the assumption that some other file is lying around uncompressed? One simple version of that would use diffs, but perhaps there is a more sophisticated way?
[16:44:56] <orbisvicis> I'm trying to link opencv on cygwin and it is failing to find the python libraries. This is either 1) because of Cygwin 2) Because of linker flags --as-needed --exclude-libs=ALL --enable-auto-import  (still fails when removed) 3) The library search path used by g++, how do I see this?

[20:01:30] <Dagmar> The good news is that most distros already use an include directive in the sudoers file, and you can pretty much just append it to the end if it doesn't
[20:01:41] <nvz> b1ack0p: the OTHER possibility is, its FINDING that field, but there is nothing at all in it.. its null
[20:02:00] <nvz> b1ack0p: some error handling would get around this if the xml isn't exactly as expected
[20:02:10] <Dagmar> twiclo: Okay, and if some admin goes in there and decides to change it later?  Or if the upstream distro decides they'd rather use a diffrerent number of spaces to line up the text neatlt?
[20:02:14] <twiclo> So will my inclusion file need to have the same NOPASSWD line? Will that just overwrite the default line?

[23:45:08] <freeone3000> Hi, I'm using lxde on top of openbox, and my applications open on monitor HDMI-0. I'd like them to open on monitor DP-0. Is there a way to configure this? I've already tried `xrandr --output DP-0 --default`, but this does not seem to have done anything.
[23:45:10] <Sauvin> Guest36, there is precisely one circumstance allowing for the F-bomb in this channel that I can think of, and that is in talking about Brainfuck, which is a proper noun. No other use is countenanced.
[23:45:18] <lacroix> Guest36: what help do you want?

[23:47:07] <Sauvin> See what I said, and understand it. You are certainly free to rename your program.
[23:47:22] <orbisvicis> hmm the dlls look similar diffing the objdumps -x

[23:48:07] <Guest36> why would i do it on my system
[23:48:11] <akk> freeone3000: I'm not sure what lxde does, but one possibility is e.g. if you're doing --output HDMI-0 --output DP-0 --right-of HDMI-0, switch to doing it the other way, so DP-0 is first

[23:49:44] <freeone3000> Yeah, in lxde settings it definitely has them in order HDMI-0 DP-0. So I'll see if there's any way to change it, thanks.
