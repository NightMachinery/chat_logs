[05:58:47] <Renderwww> this channel is going downhill fast. first no link to the rocket launch, then no link to the la palma volcano, not even a link to the past
[05:58:59] <Renderwww> how am I supposed to keep up with the world affairs this way?
[06:00:14] <Carbonflux> i linked the launch last night, before logged off, if that helps.
[06:00:45] <Carbonflux> the timing is interesting really, xmas day
[06:00:49] <Carbonflux> after all the delays
[06:01:09] <Carbonflux> i wonder what it will show?
[06:01:35] <Carbonflux> be funny if they found a giant eye staring back at us.
[06:02:40] <Carbonflux> honestly i suspect looking back that close to the big bang we will end up seeing a kind of "energy wall."
[06:03:49] <Renderwww> they should put ads into whatever pictures they end up showing us to fill that massive budget black hole from the costs of that thing!
[06:04:06] <Carbonflux> heh ya
[06:04:19] <Carbonflux> it was very expensive.
[06:04:29] <Carbonflux> kinda nice way to spend money tho
[06:04:41] <Carbonflux> i like the idea we are spending money on it.
[06:05:30] <Carbonflux> lets see...
[06:05:37] <Carbonflux> ah, Desmond Tutu died.
[06:05:44] <Carbonflux> he had quite that life.
[06:05:55] * Plazma slaps Carbonflux around a bit with a large lampetra tridentata
[06:06:01] <Carbonflux> the life*
[06:06:14] <Carbonflux> ouch!
[06:07:53] <Carbonflux> if you bored Renderwww you can watch the math channel, its always fun.
[06:08:38] <Carbonflux> lots of questions i can't answer, its a good thing.
[06:12:03] <Renderwww> I'm probably trying to go to bed again
[06:12:22] <Renderwww> this sleep thing is bugged
[06:12:38] <Carbonflux> restless?
[06:13:17] <Carbonflux> i can ask my gf to suggest some chinese herbs
[06:13:27] <Carbonflux> she has gotten good at it.
[06:13:40] <Carbonflux> taking lots of classes during covid 
[06:13:59] <Renderwww> chinese medecine probably recommends dried and griended sloth brain or whatever
[06:14:07] <Carbonflux> heh
[06:14:27] <Carbonflux> are you getting heat?
[06:14:30] *** Quits: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse) (Quit: Join us @ www.indiedevs.net)
[06:14:48] <Renderwww> no
[06:15:16] <Carbonflux> so you just wake up every hour or something?
[06:15:39] <Plazma> What math channel
[06:15:44] <Plazma> I heard math where
[06:15:44] <Renderwww> I wake up i the middle of the night, can't sleep for a couple of hours and then eventually fall asleep again
[06:15:47] <Carbonflux> ##math
[06:15:51] <Renderwww> meth channel
[06:16:03] <Plazma> Oh you meant the irc
[06:16:06] * Plazma slaps Renderwww around a bit with a large lamna ditropis
[06:16:32] <Carbonflux> this was the last good question, i liked the answer heh, simple...
[06:16:36] <Carbonflux> <XCode> can you guys give me an example of a polynomial g such that when we divide x^2y + 1 by that polynomial it will give us a rational function where x and y have the same powers?
[06:16:52] <Carbonflux> <PlanckWalk> g(x,y) = (x^2 y + 1) (any polynomial in (xy))
[06:16:54] <Carbonflux> heh
[06:22:34] <Carbonflux> its one of those kind of things where i think of the right answer but dismiss it because of my lack of confidence in my maths.
[06:23:18] <Carbonflux> i don't know, perhaps it was a trick question.
[06:26:43] <Carbonflux> Renderwww, i will ask her about it, just for grins, she has a lot of patients with problems like that. 
[06:27:45] <Carbonflux> that happens to me if i drink to much wine i admit.
[06:27:48] <Carbonflux> heh
[06:28:22] <Carbonflux> drinking some chamomile tea before bed helps sometimes.
[06:28:34] <Carbonflux> often its a liver issue.
[06:31:41] <Carbonflux> i guess drinking a lot of water is another option.
