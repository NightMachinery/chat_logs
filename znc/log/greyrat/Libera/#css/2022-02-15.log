[20:33:42] <Sqaure> hmw[at], thanks.. one problem ... i want it to align to bottom (https://jsfiddle.net/f1Lnebc3/) ... and i already have a float right aligning to top
[20:34:11] <hmw[at]> Won't work with a float, unfortunately
[20:34:45] <Sqaure> like this https://jsfiddle.net/f1Lnebc3/1/
[20:35:01] <Sqaure> hmw[at], oh ok. What technique would i need for that?
[20:35:12] <hmw[at]> hmm. THinking...
[20:35:44] <hmw[at]> Haven't done this specific thing in many years :)
[20:36:05] <hmw[at]> I usually used some tricks, like cheating a little and not 100% getting the same thing, but still something that looked nice
[20:36:51] <Sqaure> css is witchcraft =D
[20:37:19] <hmw[at]> it is
[20:37:25] <hmw[at]> https://jsfiddle.net/5308pwca/
[20:37:30] <hmw[at]> one trick, but it has problems
[20:38:04] <hmw[at]> 1.6em is the line height, I'd assume. The problem is, that the float may overlap stuff, when the text in the last line fully extends to the border
[20:39:20] <hmw[at]> in this case I would use position:absolute; because it would be a little simpler than using a float. The drawback is the same though.
[20:40:02] <hmw[at]> One semi-solution could be to just allow that floater to live in its own empty line of (non)text
[20:40:41] <hmw[at]> If that was satisfactory enough, I'd simply use text-align:right
[20:41:56] <hmw[at]> I don't know a good solution right now, I just woke up :) Let me think a little, perhaps I can remember or come up with someting. Or someone else reads this.
[20:43:58] <hmw[at]> What type of thing would you want to put in that corner? A button? I might come up with suggestion on how to do it completely different, that works with said content.
[20:44:03] <hmw[at]> Sqaure: ^

[20:46:11] <Sqaure> hmw[at], nice. i guess it cant be too tricky cause then i would loose control.
[20:46:17] <hmw[at]> yes
[20:46:35] <Sqaure> i guess i need to come up with a different design. Maybe just have the top floater
[20:47:09] <hmw[at]> It is easy to position something in the bottom right corner. Having the main content float around that is tricky
[20:47:17] <hmw[at]> flow*
[20:50:01] <hmw[at]> Sqaure: Hm. Putting the floating stuff inside the main text like so https://jsfiddle.net/5308pwca/1/
[20:50:22] <hmw[at]> you'd have to work around some of the margins and line height issues, by adding a negative margin accordingly.
[20:50:58] <hmw[at]> Yeah, that seems to work reliably
[20:51:34] <hmw[at]> https://jsfiddle.net/5308pwca/2/ added ccccccccccc
[20:54:59] <hmw[at]> There remains an issue with the background color (resize until the floater is alone on its line). I'd apply the color to the parent element to fix that.

[20:58:12] <Sqaure> hmw[at], sweet!
[20:58:46] <hmw[at]> I usually dislike changing the markup only so the CSS can work. That is "evil". Sometimes I just don't know any better either :/
[20:59:17] <hmw[at]> Sqaure: http://www.csszengarden.com/
[20:59:56] <Sqaure> hmw[at], im thankful for your help. Last proposal could work
[21:01:41] <hmw[at]> Sqaure: You already seem to have figured this out. Complexity in CSS can be harmful. Therefore my standard tipp: Use as little HTML as possible (avoid adding wrappers). Avoid position and negative margins, if possible. Those can stack up to a monster on their own, too.
[21:02:26] <Sqaure> yeah, ive seen that happen. I know my limitations on css so i wont go into the rabbit hole.
[21:02:30] <hmw[at]> We have a name for that
[21:02:34] <hmw[at]> `divitis
[21:02:34] <Selvvir> hmw[at], Divitis is when you use tons of <div>s when you don't have to. Create the HTML for the page first, THEN style it. The fewer elements you have, the fewer problems you have.
