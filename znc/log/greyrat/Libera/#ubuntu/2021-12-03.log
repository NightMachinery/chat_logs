[00:01:23] <Vaelatern> hey guys, I'm trying to get an Ubuntu live ISO to let me use the full grub> prompt during boot. Editing grub values for the menu is acceptable. I'm booting an amd64 20.04 live-server image. My problem is at best I can get to a boot: prompt, and I could also get to a relatively useless "Advanced mode" where I can modify the kernel cmdline slightly.

[01:48:12] <sweater> Hello, I want to switch java version control to nix / direnv / flakes. To be sure it works, I want to delete all the JREs and JDKs installed on ubuntu. How do I do that?
[01:48:57] <sweater> Currently, `which java` returns `/usr/bin/java`, which is a symlink, to "alternatives". None of the files belong to any package:
[01:49:39] <sweater> (I checked with dpkg -S)... I'm kind of at a loss since I don't even know what `/etc/alternatives` are.
[01:50:39] <sarnold> sweater: /etc/alternatives is an easy way to select which of the dozen different java runtime environments you want to be "java", or which of the dozen vi implementations you want to be "vi", or which of the dozen MTAs you could install you want to be "sendmail", etc
[01:51:15] <sweater> That's what I felt. I found out `update-alternatives` command, which seems to activate / deactivate alternatives.
[01:51:32] <sarnold> good good
[01:51:39] <sweater> But I'm still confused as for why aren't they tracked by dpkg :(
[01:51:51] <sarnold> because they're created and destroyed by maintainer scripts

[01:52:11] <sarnold> in conjunction with update-alternatives, for the sysadmin to select as they wish
[01:52:30] <sarnold> what do you mean by "I want to delete all the JREs and JDKs"?
[01:52:45] <sarnold> like, purge their packages? or just make the 'java' and 'javac' etc commands useless?
[01:53:23] <sweater> I would like to make sure that none of the tools, even if they use hardcoded /usr/lib/jvm/.../java would stop working.
[01:54:05] <sweater> And then I want to use direnv to govern java and, perhaps, throw away the tools that aren't compatible with it.
[01:54:56] <sweater> Thing is that I'm writing guidelines for our startup and we already are using direnv / nix extensively, so I need to be really sure that whatever I write in the policy document will actually work on the machines of my colleagues.
[01:55:31] <sweater> I hope that it all makes sense. Currently I'm reading about `update-alternatives --remove`
[01:55:42] *** Quits: aaruni (~aaruni@user/aaruni) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:55:51] <sarnold> heh, I'm afraid I'm even more confused now :) "make sure that none of the tools ... would stop working"?
[01:56:17] <sweater> For example, VSCode's java extension should stop working after I'm done.
[01:56:33] <sweater> I've deleted all the java packages, but VSCode's extension still works.
[01:56:56] <sweater> I assume that it's because of `/usr/bin/java` symlink.
[01:57:00] <sarnold> and dpkg -l "openjdk*" agrees that they're all gone?
[01:57:09] <sweater> Let me check, but IIRC yes.

[06:32:26] <sarnold> that'd be easier for a lot of tasks, yeah
[06:32:52] <Gallomimia> i seem to recall telling myself never to install a distro of ubuntu until a month or two later
[06:33:15] <Gallomimia> the first few weeks for the distro to get its poop in a pile. the next for everyone else to notice it's landed and they need to update
[06:36:29] <sarnold> but a *lot* of third-party programs and such only ever target the LTS releases
[06:36:39] <sarnold> the LTS releases get something like 90 or 95% of the users
[06:36:53] <sarnold> and there's way fewer of them
[06:37:49] <sarnold> it's like a walking, talking, example of the pareto principle -- you can get 90 or 95% of the users for 25% of the work. that's an obvious choice for folks maintaining their software 'outside' the ecosystem
[06:39:00] <Gallomimia> i think i need to understand more about what a release actually entails. that line of thinking right there makes me wonder why do the releases between the LTS milestones at all

[18:10:24] <giesen> I'm trying to do an autoinstall of ubuntu 20.04 with the user-data/meta-data files on a 2nd cdrom, but Ubuntu doesn't seem to be picking them up. The 2nd cdrom has a label of "cidata", and my boot arguments are (in addition to the standard ones): autoinstall ds=nocloud;seedfrom=/cidata/. Any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong?

[19:26:32] <feral_hedgehog> Hello! So Wayland decided to crash during a release upgrade from 20.04 to 21.04. I think it was at the dpkg --configure stage (it was asking whether to replace modified files in etc).
[19:26:37] <feral_hedgehog> I haven't restarted the laptop, and have tried running 'dpkg --configure -a' which complained that another instance is already running (ps shows dpkg --force-overwrite --status-fd 118 --configure --pending).
[19:26:44] <feral_hedgehog> Do I kill the existing dpkg and run dpkg --configure -a?

[21:59:49] <tomreyn> but snapshotting doesn't help you if the data on the snapshot will be in an inconsistent state
[22:00:07] <tomreyn> and snapshotting is not backup
[22:00:42] <ramblebamble> good point, and a sync might take a while and be a performance hit, didn't consider that

[22:28:14] <Smashcat> Currently the only reliable way tochange WiFi settings is to update the netplan file, then reboot the machine.

[23:45:15] <tomreyn> z1haze: this does not have to be due to the mirror servers (CDN). you could try a traceroute, try https rather than http, maybe ipv6 rather than ipv4...

[23:46:20] <z1haze> all im doing is running `sudo apt update` im not picking an http protocol
[23:46:25] <z1haze> im also not picking the servers
[23:46:40] <tomreyn> right, but you could
[23:47:16] <z1haze> not without help. I don't know how to do this
[23:48:46] <tomreyn> do you know what traceroute is? maybe start with this: sudo apt install mtr && mtr -w -c5 us.archive.ubuntu.com

[23:49:03] <tomreyn> then post the output to https://paste.ubuntu.com or https://paste.debian.org
[23:50:20] <tomreyn> you may want to omit the line starting      "1." and maybe "2." since this could give away your location and ISP, if that's a privacy risk

[23:52:32] <z1haze> well my server is not local
[23:52:35] <elyograg> I just did apt update on two servers, one running focal and the other impish.  The focal one took two seconds, and the impish took one second.  The impish server has one extra repo (zabbix) and the focal server has four (mysql, zabbix, plex, gitlab).
[23:52:44] <z1haze> but I can ping my server just fine
