[16:14:55] <Blankspace> Ok
[16:15:01] <Blankspace> No prob
[16:15:18] <Blankspace> I am ready to be bored

[16:15:54] <Blankspace> most of the time I guess
[16:16:01] <Lumine> I am in fact not generally bored, I always have something to create
[16:16:25] <arryana> a friend and i were discussing this last week.  we can't imagine what bored people do all day.
[16:17:01] <Blankspace> Ohh I read about the most boring people and all their traits matched with mine
[16:17:04] <arryana> what do you do with your time?
[16:17:13] <Lumine> I can imagine it, they're lodged in their couches/chairs and bouncing a rubber ball off the ceiling

[16:17:56] <Blankspace> I just sit and ponder
[16:17:56] <arryana> oy, i hope that was a joke
[16:18:46] <arryana> so basically, you don't do anything
[16:19:17] <Blankspace> Nothing
[16:19:52] <arryana> i see why you wouldn't have much to talk about
[16:20:55] <Blankspace> Yes occasionally I clean
[16:21:01] <Blankspace> But that's it
[16:21:23] <Blankspace> Occasionally I cook
[16:21:50] <arryana> yeah, that's basically adulthood.  most people cook and clean daily.
[16:22:41] <Blankspace> Yes so I also do only these two
[16:22:46] <arryana> wow.
[16:22:55] <Blankspace> Other than that boring
[16:23:31] <Blankspace> Why you surprised
[16:23:44] <arryana> because that seems like an amazing waste.
[16:23:55] <arryana> at least, from where i sit.
[16:24:08] <arryana> lumi does art, programming, and writing.
[16:24:32] <Blankspace> Nice my mind works like I am not able to master anything
[16:24:39] <arryana> you wouldnt know that.
[16:24:47] <arryana> mastering things takes time and effort.
[16:24:59] <Blankspace> I never get good at anything

[16:25:15] <Blankspace> Always a novice at everything
[16:25:21] <arryana> for instance, i'm crocheting a coat.  but the first things i made could have been done better by a three fingered six year old.
[16:25:23] <arryana> it takes time.
[16:25:37] <Lumine> Oh right, how's the coat
[16:25:40] <arryana> yeah, it probably took me a hundred hours to become really competent
[16:25:57] <Blankspace> I do everything for first three days but leave as it gets complex

[16:27:27] <arryana> wow.
[16:27:38] <arryana> do you ever worry that you'll wake up one day and think you've wasted your life?
[16:28:00] <Blankspace> But what can I do
[16:28:14] <arryana> make an effort.
[16:28:35] <arryana> 'i've tried nothing and i'm all out of ideas' is a simpsons joke.  not a way to live.
[16:30:08] <Blankspace> Then what do you suggest
[16:30:26] <arryana> i just said.  make an effort.
[16:30:26] <Blankspace> I have no idea what I should do in life so as to not waste it
[16:30:37] <arryana> watching five minutes of youtube isn't 'trying' anything

[16:33:34] <arryana> i'm considering going for a rock walk.  there's a spot in my front garden that needs a few decorative stones
[16:33:41] <arryana> woohoo!
[16:33:56] <Blankspace> I am just going to stay in my bed
[16:33:58] <pussipupu> only bit cooler here but a lot built up over winter
[16:34:43] * arryana nods
[16:34:54] <arryana> it hardly snowed at all this year, compared to last
[16:35:47] <Blankspace> send me some snoww
[16:35:49] <pussipupu> same here, but being around freezing point a lot it turned into tough ice, soooo much snow last year
[16:36:05] <Blankspace> I make snow in my fridge
[16:36:13] <arryana> yesterday i got about a third of the way toward clearing the back right corner of the garden
[16:36:20] * pussipupu loads the trebuchet
[16:36:30] <arryana> but the former owners neglected the yard for the better part of a decade, and it's going to take me years to really sort it

[16:38:02] <Lumine> Oh nice arryana
[16:38:28] <arryana> i don't usually do such things, but it was on offer and stupidly cheap

[16:40:34] <arryana> this garden has an arch-thing in it which i had assumed was made of wood.  however, it's metal, and far sturdier than i'd expected.  so after i'd finished pruning it out of the overgrowth, it seemed only fair to get it a swing chair to read in
[16:41:05] <Lumine> :)
[16:41:34] <arryana> aren't you busy helping with wedding plans?
[16:41:55] <Blankspace> Yes lots of work to do in coming days

[16:44:22] <arryana> my first wedding was just two witnesses.  my second wedding we had nearly 100 people
[16:44:36] <Lumine> :o
[16:44:44] <arryana> but it wasn't a fancy do, just a party for all of our friends to get to know each other
[16:45:09] <arryana> it was for them more than us, and we'll do it again for our tenth anniversary
[16:45:27] <Lumine> Weddings... not for me
[16:45:43] <arryana> yeah, we didn't do the dress-up-and-ceremony thing
[16:46:16] <arryana> we went to the town he was born in for the civil bit, and his parents, aunts, and uncles came.
[16:46:39] <arryana> the party was the next day in york, all his friends and a bunch of mine
[16:47:02] <Lumine> Our 6th month anniversary is coming next month with my partner
[16:47:06] <arryana> awww
[16:47:08] <arryana> that's lovely
[16:47:14] <arryana> we've had our seventh anniversary

[16:47:23] <arryana> the first time i was married 20 years
[16:49:10] <arryana> the first one was great for the first five, and went downhill after that.  this time it gets better every year.
[16:49:46] <Lumine> That's good to hear about the current one
[16:49:49] <arryana> i suspect quite a lot of that is it's a lot easier to know what to value in a partner after getting older
[16:49:55] <Blankspace> How did you meet the second
[16:50:03] <arryana> actually, we met on irc.
[16:50:17] <Blankspace> Oh and the first
[16:50:25] <Lumine> Fun fact about IRC; it was invented 10 kilometres from my house
[16:50:26] <arryana> though we had absolutely no romantic feelings for each other until we met in person
[16:50:30] <arryana> really?
[16:50:33] <Lumine> Yes
[16:50:35] <arryana> the first one i met through a mutual friend

[17:26:36] <mycroftiv> arryana: i believe im communicating about my actual life projects and base reality. my actual life project is a philosophical work to give more people access to modern mathematical ideas in relation to their religion and deploy computer tech to help organize
[17:27:10] <Blankspace> Tech is boring art is entertaining
[17:27:13] <mycroftiv> arryana: and i am sorry if the overlap of my long term life work as a philosopher trying to actually bring ideas into peoples heads consensually, and talking a lot in this channel, seems too self-promotory and long winded.
[17:28:04] <Atque> arryana: I think people talk the same way again and again. Familiarity breeds boredom I suspect, but unfamiliarity causes apathy too.
[17:28:58] <mycroftiv> atque: so even though I have bipolar, i can write computer code that typechecks and matches published mathematical theorems, so i can use this to make sure that im staying anchored in many ways, for instance
[17:29:11] <mycroftiv> of course what i have learned is this doesnt help SOCIALLY!
[17:29:31] <mycroftiv> people will still treat you like garbage because you are weird and different and not care if your ideas are actually meaningful because your communication style is deviant
[17:29:32] <Lumine> Fortunately I have alcoholl
[17:29:39] <Lumine> -l
[17:30:03] <arryana> people often have similar topics of smalltalk, but that's because current events are limited.  that doesn't mean that's all they have to say.
[17:30:21] <Atque> mycroftiv: I care about it. I can't say it I am finding it easy to follow though.
[17:31:14] <mycroftiv> atque: well, ive been in this channel awhile and went through a major true delusional reality loss here last month, and the overall pattern of communication hasnt always been functional. i can be coherent, thank you for the feedback.
[17:31:52] <Atque> Lumine: Yea, it's Friday night here. I am like quite drunk, but... yeah, I need to work sometime over the weekend, so there's some requirement for constraint.
[17:31:56] <Atque> arryana: Well, what would you say?
[17:32:00] <mycroftiv> i often emit a lot of Weird Noise and see what feedback i get, then try to dial in a communication channel with whoever answered back and whatever they found interesting
[17:32:01] <Blankspace> It's more fun talking with arryana
[17:32:13] <Lumine> Atque: what are you having
[17:32:32] <mycroftiv> blankspace: I understand, thank you also for the feedback, I will try to not disrupt your preferred chat experience with deliberate psychedelic outrageousness.
[17:32:43] <Delf> mycroftiv: What do you mean by choosing ignorance? Choosing to ignore? And one who prefers to ignore is one who chooses "ignor(e|ance)"?
[17:32:47] <Atque> Lumine: Cooper's Pale Ale (maybe an Australia beer)... I dunno tbh
[17:32:54] <Lumine> Okay
[17:33:02] <Lumine> Sounds pale
[17:33:04] <Lumine> :)
[17:33:19] <mycroftiv> delf: it was just me being snippy since Arryana wasnt interested in a link on ultrafilters and voting systems to explain that i was talking about something meaningful that other people who arent bipolar also study
[17:34:01] <Atque> Lumine: Yeah, well, it matches my skin. Since covid, I kind of just don't see the sun anymore/bother with fake tan, so yea.
[17:34:20] <mycroftiv> basically emotional response of negativity to an ongoing negative emotional dynamic between Arryana and myself using a standard trope that is a way of telling someone they are being a lame philosopher by not loving learning new knowledge

[17:34:49] <Delf> mycroftiv: I remember a guy talking about ignorance being that of a thing one chooses not to investigate in something further thereby rendering them ignorant in that particular thing and that the word is misused and that we need another word for something that describes not knowing but not due to choice
[17:34:53] <Atque> Hey Rashad.
[17:35:05] <Lumine> mycroftiv: you do tend to take a lot of surface area of the chat, and what I gather it's mostly personal experience not easily accessible by other people nor they can relate to it
[17:35:08] <Rashad> Hi Atque
[17:35:28] <mycroftiv> delf: that is a good perspective, and my own use of the term then was basically me just being insulting in a way i generally try to avoid, but arryana crossed the rudeness boundary with me a long time ago
[17:36:06] *** Parts: Blankspace (~androirc@user/blankspace) (Quit)
[17:36:27] <mycroftiv> lumine: i try to not talk too often to balance that somewhat, but the brief periods of high intensity activity are often too much signal too much noise too much compression, too much vivid color all on top becoming dirty brown. sorry and thanks.
[17:36:29] <Delf> mycroftiv: I strongly suggest to refrain from insulting. Besides, you don't actually need to say or do anything to actually insult. People get insulted either way, even if you're NOT serving them any insults so that part is "covered" so to speak
[17:37:08] <mycroftiv> delf: i agree, there is however an important game-theoretic mathematical concept called 'Tit for Tat' involving not letting yourself be taken advantage of by people who wont cooperate with you no matter what you do
[17:38:47] <Delf> Resort to tit for tat only when ALL other options are exhausted. It is not uncommon for people to want you to play the game they're playing or rather engage in you as if you're playing the game they're playing. They give zero fucks about what you're on about
[17:38:57] <mycroftiv> delf: word
[17:39:12] <Atque> mycroftiv: I don't think talking about arryana as though they're not here is the best idea.
[17:39:48] <arryana> oh, he can't help but be a dick to anyone who doesn't take his ravings as gold plated marvels.
[17:39:54] <Delf> Worst of all, they haven't even thought it through so if you were to engage in the same game they play, they wouldn't survive because the rules of the game are based on who they are rather on principle of cooperation
[17:39:57] <mycroftiv> I know arryana is here, arryana knows Im here, everyone knows i know this and knows arryana knows this. Hi arryana! peacea and love if you give that to me in return.
[17:40:00] <arryana> that's a hallmark of the unstable.
[17:40:04] <Atque> Delf: Yeah, it's hard though hey. There's an urge to bite back, like there's instinct there.
[17:40:36] <arryana> i jsut didn't see any point pursuing it further.
[17:40:37] <mycroftiv> arryana: yes, i am deeply unstable, constant feedback from you and others is the cybernetic process of maintaining stability. thank you as always for helping.
[17:40:40] <Delf> Atque: Yes, of course. This is why I prefer to insult physically (with teeth involved) rather than with words
[17:40:57] <Atque> Delf: Lol
[17:41:16] <Lumine> mycroftiv: I get that, but if you're going to explain a lot of complex or outlandish concepts to people in a brief period of time, at least be prepared to take in some opinions and questions, that's my only advice. In other words, if you always talk and never listen, that is tantamount to living in an echo chamber. I'm not saying you don't listen, it's just the vibe I get from all this wall of text.
[17:41:37] <Atque> Delf: Love it... but idk... I think there's some impulse to do it verbally too... a natural impulse.
[17:41:59] <mycroftiv> lumine: i understand and agree. trying to say too much too fast is a manic symptom of my disorder i am trying to manage better. i really appreciate your honest help.
[17:42:48] <Lumine> mycroftiv: do you to talk people in person a lot?
[17:43:14] <Delf> Atque: You don't want to dishonor yourself by resorting to the same horeshit games that're more about creating conflict and war instead of understanding and cooperation
[17:43:19] <mycroftiv> lumine: not nearly enough since february 2020 it has been deeply harmful and painful and part of the ongoing tragic breakdown of my life :(((O
[17:43:22] <Atque> Lumine: That's fair I think, but it might be hard to do. If someone's manic, they talk a lot more. It's linked to the condition - in the same way as being dyslexic makes learning to read hard.
[17:43:50] <Lumine> I see
[17:43:57] <Lumine> Sorry to hear that
[17:44:09] <mycroftiv> lumine: and now i have lost all my real life friendships and my life partner of 9 years by my loss of reality on jan 29, so it has become 1000000x worse
[17:44:11] <Delf> mycroftiv: Do we thank covid for that?
[17:44:16] <mycroftiv> delf: yes
[17:44:27] <Atque> Delf: I agree I think. In some cases though, I think you kind of have to, but it is hard to express what those cases are.
[17:44:35] <Lumine> What do you mean by "loss of reality" mycroftiv?
[17:45:05] <Atque> Lumine: Mania and psychosis are similar I guess.
[17:45:11] <Delf> Atque: Do not think that they don't take notice of you NOT playing the same shitshow game they play, but they see it as weakness when you do NOT point out their character flaws

[17:45:25] <mycroftiv> lumine: i mean delusion to the point I thought I could fix reality with theatrical ritual in a metaphysical sense, i was unfortunately influenced by opinions from other people here i took too seriously in the wrong way, about magicand religion being real :(
[17:46:02] <mycroftiv> i am a person who is better off not taking religion too seriously because if i belive in a religion that tells me to sacrifice a goat, im doing it
[17:46:02] <Lumine> And since then?
[17:46:39] <Delf> mycroftiv: Your presence is the guide. Remain observant of what's going on outside and within, then you can make better decisions that're better for you and also better for others
[17:46:45] <mycroftiv> lumine: weeks of gradual calming but also working through the huge pile of ideas i learned from reaching actual religious communion with god for the first time via mathematics after decades of seeeking
[17:47:13] <mycroftiv> and a belief that the mathematical ideas for new technology i have are still valid because they still typecheck in the computer Agda formalization
[17:47:24] <Atque> Delf: Well, there's a guy at my local service station. He's on welfare and harasses people for money. Sometimes, he even tries to jump into cars without permission. Last time, he approach my car, I shouted at him (it scared the shit out of him). Obviously, shouting at people in general is unideal, but I feel like that was defensible somehow.
[17:48:17] <mycroftiv> delf: thank you. you have been one of the voices here that has given me very helpful words (many others have as well) and i am grateful for your kind speech.
[17:48:31] <Delf> Atque: You have no idea how much I shout and pretend to be angry while actually calm and smiling. Of course I don't shout too loud so as to not bother the ears :P
[17:48:36] <Lumine> mycroftiv: the thing about mystical experience is that the actual content of the experience can't be communicated using words. No matter how hard you try. And that is why the message is always distroted by a human instrument. My friend had a "communion with God" too, and tried to explain it to me but could never get the words out.
[17:48:49] <Lumine> distorted*
[17:49:09] <mycroftiv> lumine: no, i have the formalized Agda mathematics still. it changes what you are saying. because i can make these ideas into actual physical networks and computer programs to do new things.
[17:50:00] <Delf> mycroftiv: Nothing to thank. I'm just reminding you of things you already know and things you probably haven't even forgotten :D
[17:50:01] <Atque>  Delf: Yeah, but isn't it against the spirit of cooperation somehow? Sure, being content during doing that might be better than not, but it certainly doesn't seem cooperative.
[17:50:16] <Lumine> So you believe that mathematics can express a content which logic itself leaves behind
[17:50:30] <Delf> Atque: Actions speaks louder than yelling does :D
[17:50:40] <mycroftiv> many of the mathematicians - Cantor, Gödel, Grothendieck, Voevodsky - who walked this path of study went insane. I have followed that on purpose. But i have new applications for real world technology that I think are almost like union of mysticism and computers and brains
[17:50:57] <Lumine> Well I've got some bad news for you
[17:51:08] <Atque> Delf: Well, it was a means to an end, I did not want the guy to awkwardly get into my car.
[17:51:10] <Lumine> You will go insane too if you keep that up
[17:51:49] <mycroftiv> lumine: i already went completely delusional in 2013. i learned a lot then. i have continued research in code, math, and delusion since then, and deliberate insanity is an important tech, just like Dalí
[17:51:58] <Delf> Atque: They got physical (entering your car) you shouting (not physically engaging with them as in throwing them out). I'd say you remained civil
[17:52:05] <cirilla> :O
[17:52:13] <Atque> Delf: So maybe, the consequences feed into this somehow. Bitching, yelling, etc. might sometimes be consequentially justifiable.
[17:52:25] <Lumine> mycroftiv: so did I
[17:52:29] <Lumine> In 2013
[17:52:35] <mycroftiv> but it is indeed deeply dangerous to use, just like occultism, its very related, and I indeed failed to use it properly recently and wrecked my life, so be wary all
[17:52:36] <Atque> Delf: Aww, thanks.
[17:52:53] <Atque> Hey cirilla
[17:52:54] <cirilla> wrecked how?
[17:53:41] <Lumine> mycroftiv: you can apply many things through mathematics but what is your goal really? What are you looking out of it?
[17:53:44] <mycroftiv> cirilla: i lost reality so far i tried religious-occult ritual in daily life that was deeply insane and lost my family and friendships from my verbal outrageousness
[17:54:33] <Lumine> I am asking what are you trying accomplish with all this
[17:54:37] <mycroftiv> lumine: give the world tools to do new things, just like airplanes and telephones and antibiotics, tech for useful purposes. in my case, decision making and communication and future oriented (rather than short sighted)
[17:54:48] <Atque> cirilla: Mania and psychosis often have religious themes for some reason.
[17:54:48] <Delf> Atque: Thanks me for acknowleging it?
[17:55:27] <Lumine> mycroftiv: yeah, I'm trying to do the same thing, but I don't need any outlandish concepts for it
[17:56:14] <Delf> mycroftiv: I too lost reality and I'm not even looking to get back to it either. However, as a consequence I've lost family and friendships too. But it was still worth it :)
[17:56:34] <mycroftiv> lumine: the idea of combining fiction and reality and allowing us to have virtual reality lucid dream psychedelic assisted experiences of talking to our dead relatives and stuff is a far out idea, and thats my actual technological concept, partly
[17:56:49] <cirilla> wow
[17:56:55] <cirilla> talking to the dead relatives :S
[17:56:56] <Lumine> Yeah that is just not feasible

[18:14:38] <mycroftiv> lumine: some of my quasi-delusional beliefs are self-programming techniques to help keep me motivated and working by belief in imaginary worlds where doing good work actually produces equivalent benefits
[18:15:24] <mycroftiv> there is flat out non-delusional honesty about why i am like i am and its costs and benefits and origins in trauma and possible value in the standard 'religion is whatever lie helps you get by day to day' sense

[18:29:35] <Atque> Filohuhum: Sounds like you know about it though?
[18:29:58] <mycroftiv> I have an ongoing idea to link things to physically existing tokens so everything is a multilayer stack from the physical through the virtual and its true creation of value by laminating the narrative and physical and digital
[18:30:02] <Lumine> I'd rather stop painting altogether than take my chances at blockchain
[18:30:29] <mycroftiv> so rather than NFT, make physical true art, then multiply its value by reflecting it into the virtual world
[18:31:09] <Lumine> When I heard DeviantArt was going to get into the NFT business, I knew it was all over
[18:31:45] <arryana> anything for a buck, for most people
[18:31:47] <arryana> it's a shame

[18:44:10] <Lumine> It was about one of Gödel's theorems, which goes over my head but I heard an interpretation of one of them which led me to think something.
[18:44:13] <arryana> lunch wouldn't be a terrible concept either
[18:44:15] <arryana> oh yeah?
[18:44:52] <Lumine> The theorem states that you cannot have a system of logic which defines its own axioms
[18:45:22] <arryana> that seems reasonable
[18:45:33] <arryana> though it doesn't really account for exceptions

[18:46:22] <Lumine> And furthermore, he went to show that any model that we make up, will have in it an aspect of the unknown and inaccuracy. In other words, that all models about the universe will always be incomplete. I mentioned this once here I think.
[18:47:21] <Lumine> And so this led me to a rather strange place
[18:48:16] * arryana listens
[18:48:58] <Lumine> Where, the reason for the incompleteness, is not one so much of mathematical precision, but one of identity. What if, we're not meant to find out ultimately where we are? And what our place is?
[18:49:49] <arryana> hm.
[18:49:52] <mycroftiv> lumine: your intuition there corresponds to actual mathematics that takes Gödel's work and extends it to higher infinities called large cardinals and investigates the identity and its diagonalization
[18:49:52] <arryana> do we only have one place?
[18:49:58] <arryana> one possibility?
[18:50:51] <Lumine> I don't know, I just find it interesting to think out the reason why we can't ever have a full picture.
[18:52:04] <arryana> i think the picture's always going to be too big.
[18:52:56] <arryana> none of us really process most of what we see, even

[18:54:33] <Lumine> I know I'm throwing the term out here that arryana once said people will throw out too easily, but I'll do it. Quantum mechanics has gotten as far as making the statement that there is no real division between events and particles in nature, because if entaglement is to mean anything, it means that you cannot describe any event apart from its context. Btw, I might just be talking out of my ass here but I'm giving it a shot.
[18:57:22] <arryana> haha
[19:01:04] <Lumine> Damn, I lost my train of thought. In a nutshell: we will never know the whole thing.
[19:01:43] <arryana> haha
[19:01:54] <arryana> i don't think anyone's meant to know 'the whole thing'
[19:02:01] <arryana> would it matter if we did?
[19:02:31] <Lumine> Ah, so here's the place where I got, thanks arryana
[19:03:12] <Lumine> I argue that if we DID have the whole picture, and had a perfect model, then we would have no surprises left in regards to the universe.
[19:04:07] <mycroftiv> its a theorem of math/quantum information that we cannot know our selves and world well enough to predict ourselves as if we were machines, even if in some sense we are, the eye cant open wide enough to see all of itself
[19:04:38] <mycroftiv> youd have to disassemble the original world in order to make the perfect copy to study
[19:05:57] <arryana> i think there's always going to be too many possibilities.
[19:06:08] <arryana> time is a limiting factor.
[19:06:36] <arryana> how much of the 'whole picture' can we absorb, even over the course of a thousand years, let alone a human lifetime?
[19:08:01] <mycroftiv> we are lucky that those who lived before absorbed a lot, then compressed what they absorbed into books and music and pictures, and so as we absorb the information they gave us, we have the memory of a bigger life and world than our own, somewhat

[19:33:23] <mycroftiv> the entire universe is very curious about itself so it carefully Ouroboros eats its own tail to learn about itself and digest the knowledge, our eyeballs and brains do this locally, black holes do it cosmically
[19:33:58] <mycroftiv> but since the entire universe is also all-knowing about itself by being itself, this creates a lot of the paradoxical aspects of how it seems to play out
[19:35:06] <mycroftiv> local curiousity vs global omniscience, but the local and global are just poles of the continuum of the same actual universe being itself understanding itself, which is still just cliche but the mathematics can be formalized and helps us if we mirror it properly in practicece
[19:37:03] <mycroftiv> the awareness that we are the universe understanding itself which is the same as eating itself is symbolically disturbing and often gets reflected most clearly in horror themed fiction
[19:38:11] <mycroftiv> the reproduction of information is constant and for humans plays out with biological sexuality and the horror of sex and death from the viewpoint of the symbolic immortal information loops of consciousness being trapped in mortal bodies is deep
