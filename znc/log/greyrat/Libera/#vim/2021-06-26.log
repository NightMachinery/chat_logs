[13:38:27] <romainl> "add some text" is a bit fuzzy
[13:39:04] <chronon> I was right c replaces the selection.
[13:39:07] <alzgh> yeah, in my case it didn't matter much. I had extra white space and relied on the formatter to take care of the rest

[18:33:15] <nova> and you may want to use unnamedplus instead of unnamed
[18:33:30] <nova> but I hate that because everything you yank in vim shows up in your system clipboard
[18:33:46] <fakuve> 1 for the first command
[18:34:07] <nova> unnamedplus and p is equivalent t "+p whereas unnamed and p is equivalent to "*p

[18:34:25] <fakuve> nova: im using unnamed cos it was the only way to work with the other

[21:07:41] <chronon> Why are you capturing the lookahead part and then not using it? I don't think you need the \( \) in that pattern because the \[] part is already a singel atom.
[21:08:53] <chronon> Also, I thnk my suggestion of %s/ENCODER1\>/ENCODER33/g would be simpler unless you really need to be sure there's *only* a slash or quote after.

[22:26:44] <fakuve> ray: exactly I needed to nest the command in between ''
[22:27:12] <fakuve> chronon: yep so basically I got the structure now
[22:27:18] <chronon> I see there are objects of type "knob" that have ENCODER\d+ in the "id", then there are objects of type "text" that have it in the "value" field.
[22:28:03] <chronon> You don't actually want to set both types and all of them to the same ENCODER33 do you?
[22:28:12] <fakuve> yep they need to be changed , ENCODER1 to ENCODER33 , ENCODER2 to ENCODER34
[22:28:43] <fakuve> yep all the ENCODER1's to be ENCODER33 in all the fields
[22:29:05] <fakuve> I was having problems with ENCODER11 ENCODER12 etc...
[22:29:08] <chronon> Ah, so it's a renumbering. That really really sounds like a job for jq. I don't think I'd use vim for that. But maybe someone really clever with vimscript could use vim for it.
[22:29:16] <fakuve> they shouldnt get changed by ENCODER1

[22:31:41] <chronon> The trouble with a renumbering using global search/replace is that you could easily cause a clash and thus lose the ability to distinguish between those you've renumberd and those you haven't. A programmatic approach with jq would not have that issue.
[22:32:25] <fakuve> yep you are right
[22:32:35] <chronon> However I cannot really start giving you a jq solution without the rest of the json file for context.
[22:33:05] <fakuve> Thanks chronon:  , i dont wanna get into jq today
[22:33:14] <chronon> Up to you.
[22:33:16] <fakuve> but I will have it in mind
[22:33:34] <chronon> There's a #jq channel if you change your mind.
[22:33:43] <fakuve> thx :D
[22:34:30] <alfiejfs> Hey, I am using https://github.com/arzg/vim-colors-xcode on my Mac and notice when I full screen the terminal there is a weird white outline around the edges. Is that just a macos white terminal thing?
[22:34:46] <alfiejfs> I can send my vimrc if that's necessary, but got a feeling it's just an OS thing

[22:36:42] <alfiejfs> Very new to it, trying to use it for some note taking with vimtex.
[22:37:17] <chronon> fakuve, how about this: Starting from the top of the file you type /ENCODER to search for the first one. Then type 32^A  (that a control A) this will add 32 to the number at the end of ENCODER. Then type n to find the next one, and . (dot) to repeat the edit, n.n.n. all the way to the end.

[22:39:52] <chronon> You could even macro the n. using qwn.q and then repeat it with a count say 100@w to perform lots of them at once.
[22:40:39] <chronon> Hmmm, not sure if that macro works.
[22:42:08] <fakuve> chronon: thats a good idea , i need to process that syntax as Im not really familiarised
[22:42:25] <chronon> alfiejfs, I bet that's just the terminal showing an edge where the characters don't perfectly fit the space.
[22:43:51] <chronon> I was using ^A which along with ^X can be used for incrementing and decrementing numbers. See :help CTRL-A

[22:52:47] <fakuve> but really is there no way to actually select a chunk of text that have in each line vim commands , and execute it one by one?
[22:55:51] <chronon> You could copy lines into a register and execute the register with @<regletter> but it's a bit fiddly to get right. I'd suggest writing a function instead. When you select multiple lines, then do :'<,'>MyFunc() it will call the function once for each line.

[22:57:31] *** Quits: snac73 (~textual@151.53.207.133) (Client Quit)
[22:58:09] <chronon> Not that bad. You want several ex commands grouped into a single action, which you can then apply as a single action to each line in a selection. The function would do that.

[23:02:21] <chronon> I am suggesting that you search for ENCODER and find each of them after that by pressing n. On each one you find (that needs to be changed) you can then do 32^A to increase the number by 32 which I think is what you want. After the first time, you won't need to type 32^A because you can just type . (a dot) to repeat the action. Works for me.
[23:02:45] <fakuve> amm ok its sounds reasonable
[23:03:09] <chronon> Then it's just n.n.n.n.n.n. all the way down. Easy.
