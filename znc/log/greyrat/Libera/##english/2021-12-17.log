[00:24:43] <twb> Gods, Rowling's prose is so wearisome
[00:25:23] <twb> I don't think "it's a YA novel" should be a get-out-of-gaol-free-card for bad prose

[00:36:36] <mornfall> since when are young adult novels about kids?
[00:36:46] <twb> mornfall: "Young adult fiction (YA) is a category of fiction written for readers from 12 to 18 years of age."
[00:38:01] <mornfall> /o
[00:39:12] <blkshp> mornfall: yes but 17 at the close (actually 30 at the close technically)
[00:39:22] <blkshp> It's a set of books to grow up with, that's the pojnt
[00:39:47] <blkshp> tinsoldier: when was Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone released?
[00:39:55] <tinsoldier> Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. The first novel in the Harry Potter series and Rowling's debut novel, it follows Harry Potter...

[00:41:37] <blkshp> SSDD
[00:41:45] <mornfall> starting at about 9, coz who wants their childhood heroes to be younger than they are... but i guess, clearly YA as a term is a not a pinnacle of logic
[00:41:49] <blkshp> I mean were getting into SSDY territory now.
[00:41:58] <tinwhiskers> true
[00:42:44] <blkshp> mornfall: I believe he started at 11. At that time i was 12/13 so I basically grew up with them at the same time

[04:19:42] <wiscii> I find the "speech" given to be of a quality not often found today.
[04:20:54] <wiscii> i believe, the thing that i find most fascinating is: this was a "british" reporter, in the midst of the French Revolution"
[04:21:10] <wiscii> and we Brits are not famous for liking the French
[04:22:07] <wiscii> and so, the way the reporter relays back the situation seems to be of unnatural gravitas .. if you see ?
[04:24:24] <wiscii> what looks to be relatively "innocent", is, in fact, a very barbed hook, plunged into the crumbling French aristocracy..
[04:25:08] <wiscii> it is a wicked double meaning, that is only doubled due to this day and ages expectations ..
[04:27:09] <wiscii> of course, this all presumes some truth to the comment
[04:27:22] <wiscii> but it sounds so plausible
[04:29:22] <wiscii> i find the word "understand" to be equally omminous ..

[09:25:38] <mdogg> I was wrong when I suggested 'subtext'.  That has a completely different meaning.  What I was thinking about was the option when creating a document where there is supertext (above the baseline) and subtext (below the baseline)..
[09:26:02] <mdogg> And the term "subtext" in a story has a different meaning than even that..

[12:28:15] <arash> Hello, in "If you don't want it, Morris," said the old man, "give it to me." is it means someone said something to old man or it means old man said something?
[12:28:42] <pussipupu> That the old man said something
[12:29:22] <furrykef> Definitely that the old man said something
[12:29:25] <mdogg> Correct.

[12:30:22] <arash> why its not "the old man said"? I mean what is the difference said the old man and the old main said?
[12:30:41] <pussipupu> I can see why it might be confusing, as English is generally SVO, but it's unambigously the old man speaking
[12:31:27] <pussipupu> You can be relatively free about word order where there isn't ambiguity, and in this case the quote can't be the subject of the verb and the man can't be the object so it's not ambiguous
[12:31:45] <mdogg> It's common to see this type of narration in English literature.  
[12:32:15] <mdogg> Many authors use it.
[12:32:15] <arash> ok. thank you
