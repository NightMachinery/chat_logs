[15:44:06] <cvmn> Alipha: how about this:  allow double-spending to happen, and let the double-spending be confirmed.  but:  once the double-spending is detected/confirmed, deduct money from the criminals and give it to his victims.
[15:45:23] <yawkat> that requires the criminal to have enough money to compensate all victims
[15:45:33] <yawkat> in which case it wouldnt be a double spend in the first place
[15:50:42] <cvmn> i'm thinking if a person should freeze/lock some large-enough amount of money for a long-enough time as a guarantee to allow his unconfirmed payments to be accepted now (with the promise that he has enough cash for say 1 month, which is enough to eventually confirm his payments).
[15:51:42] <yawkat> with enough forks, the attacker can spend an arbitrary amount of money, no matter what her spending limit is.
[16:00:12] <cvmn> how about:  make wallet creation require endorsement from some kind of heirarichal web of trust.  if a person's wallet is found empty after a double-spending, he is blacklisted, and recursively the punishment walks upwards to those that signed/endorsed him (e.g. if they lack the money to pay, they --too-- will get blacklisted).
[16:01:46] <yawkat> very easy to DoS, just spend more than there is money in the chain, and your entire wot will die
[16:02:25] <cvmn> the network will blacklist everyone?
[16:04:26] <cvmn> how about:  
[16:04:27] <cvmn>  1. those that endorse others, will set a guarantee cap on their endorsement.  this way, we can have weighted endorsements, based on how much trust one assigns to a person.  eventually it will be like a government.
[16:04:29] <cvmn>  2. some will do mistakes, and endorse non-trusty people.  they will get harshly punished.  but eventually, society will evolve to effectively make 'endorsers' more strict.
[16:05:10] <MacGyver> And this is better than a regulated banking system, how?
[16:05:43] <MacGyver> Putting the burden of judging trust on the individual sounds like a society *I* don't want to live in.
[16:06:03] <yawkat> you not only have to trust that person, but also trust them to keep their cryptographic keys safe
[16:06:17] <MacGyver> If there's that kind of harsh punishment, the safe individual bet is not to endorse anyone.
[16:06:23] <MacGyver> Good luck getting that kind of system to work.
[16:07:10] <cvmn> you can give them money to endorse you.
[16:07:49] <yawkat> no you cant lol, because you cant spend before youre endorsed
[16:08:17] <cvmn> for that, we pay by the u.s.d (joking)
[16:09:17] <MacGyver> Why is that a joke? Even *if* the concept made sense, which it doesn't because there's not enough money you can give anyone to endorse you if the risk is *they* get blacklisted from the system if they can't cover *your* criminal behaviour, how else would you do it?
[16:09:25] <cvmn> yawkat: we can.  it's just that the endorser will require a long enough wait time until the payment has propagated enough throughout the network to ensure that the news about his income is spread enough to make it hard to undo it.

[16:11:03] <yawkat> again, a cap cant work, because there can be many forks
[16:11:07] <cvmn> but you're right, paying by the u.s.d. is possible.  whatever makes the endorser happy to endorse him.  or just good behaviour.
[16:11:24] <MacGyver> cvmn: You're presupposing the absence of double spending there, which is the exact thing you're arguing this solves.
[16:12:59] <cvmn> basically, i'm trying to make wallet creation hard enough to make a person have incentives to not double-spend.
[16:13:32] <yawkat> but what if a wallet gets stolen
[16:13:34] <MacGyver> But *if* somebody double spends, and gets blacklisted, if other people can't cover for them they also get blacklisted.
[16:13:37] <cvmn> some endorsers may evolve to require close knowledge of their endorsees.  if he cheats, then they may burn his house.
[16:13:44] <MacGyver> That in itself creates a system nobody will want to use.
[16:13:51] <MacGyver> Oh great, burning a house.
[16:13:58] <MacGyver> How about using a f*ing legal system?
[16:14:10] <cvmn> too centralised.
[16:14:28] <MacGyver> Right, because distribution is the holy grail for whatever moronic reason of the day.

[16:19:47] <cvmn> currently, fiat seems to work this way:  delayed double-spending confirmations, thanks to threats by the legal system against those that use money printers to issue fake notes.

[16:30:20] <cvmn> i don't get the value of having a central authority issue money.  we should instead be honest about it:  deduct money from some people, and give it to some other people.  because this is what inflation does anyway.
[16:31:09] <wasamasa> I'd say we just let people believing cryptocurrency is a step forward play in their sandbox where they cannot do any harm

[18:38:50] <yawkat> you dont need to sign the box key if you publish it in the same route you use for the signing key
[18:39:13] <yawkat> and one reason why you cant do it out of the box is that the signing and the kex happen on different curves

[20:37:39] <Legend> Is it possible to have a tamper proof channel between two parties that have never met before (without a third party like a CA)?
[20:39:55] <int-e> <Eve> Alice: Hi, I'm Bob, nice chatting with you.
[20:40:24] <Legend> darn it
[20:41:12] <yawkat> I think you can do it with quantum channels, but usefulness is limited. 
[20:41:25] <Legend> ah like BB84!
[20:41:33] <Legend> I'll convince Verizon to get me a quantum fiber channel
[20:42:08] <yawkat> bb84 still needs an authenticated classical channel
[20:42:18] <int-e> so when will we get switched intercontinental quantum networks ;)
[20:42:26] <Legend> we need quantum networks!
[20:42:35] <sm2n> *whispers* never
[20:42:47] <sm2n> Also I don't think you can switch quantum protocols
[20:44:17] <yawkat> i think you could, you just cant clone the qbits.
[20:44:22] <Legend> I bet you guys aren't real

[20:45:41] <dude12312414> but why does Alice care if she's talking to Eve or Bob? I mean presumably there is something Bob has that Eve doesn't? Can that be somehow used by Alice to know she's talking to Bob?
[20:45:57] <int-e> yawkat: yeah you should be able to do that... you just risk losing most of the photons along the way making the whole stuff impractical
[20:46:23] <yawkat> this is quantum communication, nobody cares about practicality
[20:47:16] <sm2n> dude12312414: Ususally (wo)man-in-the-middle style attacks are considered undesirable
[20:47:51] <sm2n> so Alice might be talking to Bob, but Eve might be transparently in the middle, eavesdropping
[20:48:05] <int-e> But who is Bob and why is he so poplar that everybody (or, at least, Alice) wants to talk to him?
[20:48:16] <yawkat> if alice knows nothing about bob, why does she care that she's actually talking to eve? eve is a nice person, she deserves friends too.
[20:48:18] <sm2n> these style of attacks make in-band authentication impossible
[20:48:45] <sm2n> Maybe Alice knows many things about Bob, just not his public key
[20:49:20] <Platonides> there are cases where you only care about communicating with the same entity
[20:49:35] <Platonides> so, I may not care who int-e *is*
[20:49:50] <Platonides> only that it's the same int-e I talked to a year ago
[20:49:55] <Platonides> but in other cases you do care
[20:50:03] <Platonides> such as "Bob is the banker of Alice"

[21:58:46] <TimMc> https://astralcodexten.substack.com has a series of "Mantic Monday" posts about various prediction markets.
[21:59:58] <TimMc> It's probably not the best source, and he goes into detail on some specific predictions that he finds interesting, but you might find his analysis illuminating. (e.g. he mentions some structural flaws in some of them)
[22:00:49] <TimMc> learner36: He mentions Metaculus a lot, so... https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8898/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-before-2023/
[22:01:15] <TimMc> One of the difficulties is in carefully constructing the resolution criteria of the question.
[22:01:38] <learner36> thanks
[22:02:14] <TimMc> Value of the Euro relative to the USD at a certain date? Easy. Whether or not some celebrity has apologized for something? Extremely difficult. :-)
[22:03:17] <TimMc> A lot of these also don't use real money, so people may not choose their answers as carefully as they would otherwise.
