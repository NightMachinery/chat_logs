[00:00:26] <Nanobot> The height and shape of the seat also matters.
[00:00:28] <teus> custom making a chair back support, with such a mesh, should be much more doable than making one with foam and upholstery
[00:04:00] <teus> you can just draw the shape, print it, cut out a plywood pattern and tighten the mesh over it

[00:13:20] <emmeka> MootPoot I feel like if in this economy you cannot find work it's kind of a you problem. we're at labour shortage levels.
[00:14:36] <MootPoot> emmeka: labor for physical labor seems like
[00:14:54] <MootPoot> for office work or dev work it seems like that is not the case
[00:14:55] <MootPoot> idk
[00:15:15] <MootPoot> supposedly the forecast for my industry in my area according to the govt is good 
[00:15:19] <MootPoot> 3/3 stars
[00:15:20] <emmeka> it is totes the case, though
[00:15:45] <emmeka> it does help to be willing to work in meatspace
[00:15:54] <emmeka> you'll have more trouble if you're committed to remote
[00:16:24] <MootPoot> well, everyone is remote now - I'm okay with commuting a little but even "non-remote" dev jobs are remote now
[00:16:42] <MootPoot> they say they aren't remote - but when you ask them in the interview they say they actually are and have hopes of going back
[00:17:04] <teus> remember when working from home was a pipe dream?
[00:17:21] <teus> and plenty of recruiting going one for really shitty/shady "work from home" jobs
[00:17:56] <teus> MootPoot: whats "your industry"
[00:19:58] <MootPoot> software dev
[00:20:08] <teus> that doesnt say much
[00:20:11] <emmeka> MootPoot but I mean don't worry about it too much they say what 1 in 50 resumes result in an offer of employment?
[00:20:21] <teus> emmeka: i never got how that worked

[00:20:50] <teus> on reddit i see plenty of such stories, but im not from USA
[00:20:58] <teus> i never had to apply more than 5 times to get a job
[00:21:01] <emmeka> teus don't get how what worked
[00:21:18] <teus> my last job was referred to me from a friend and i got a contract on the first interview
[00:21:33] <teus> so i dont get how people send out 50 applications
[00:22:06] <emmeka> well, that makes you either fairly conservative in your job application habits (you tend only to apply to jobs you know you can get) or means you've never been in a situation of having to find work urgently.
[00:22:30] <teus> the latter is absolutely true
[00:22:34] <teus> the former is worth thinking about
[00:22:46] <MootPoot> I think I've been applying for maybe 2 months so far
[00:22:56] <emmeka> well but how many jobs.
[00:22:56] <MootPoot> about 100 or so applications- with 3-4 leads
[00:23:06] <MootPoot> none of them worked out
[00:23:10] <emmeka> sounds like about an average success rate
[00:23:13] <teus> eh
[00:23:14] <emmeka> keep at it and all.
[00:23:20] <MootPoot> aside from one which was like "We like you but we're not hiring atm"
[00:23:24] <teus> so is MootPoot aiming at a job too high to grab?
[00:23:26] <MootPoot> "Call us in 6 months"
[00:23:57] <teus> its not like the job market is any friendly... jobs requiring 10 years of experience, but not hiring anyone older than 30, etc
[00:24:19] <emmeka> teus probably, but also, these results don't sound too bad.
[00:24:29] <teus> still doesnt make sense to me :c
[00:24:43] <MootPoot> funnily enough - remote OR not, the only people who called me are people who were in my city
[00:25:03] <emmeka> well, when you're unemployed and your timeframe for when you need work is "immediately" you apply to a lot of things, including things with relatively slim chances of noticing or hiring you
[00:25:18] <teus> well im not from EU
[00:25:20] <teus> er
[00:25:23] <teus> im not from USA
[00:25:31] <teus> so a shitty random job barely pays more than unemployment
[00:25:51] <emmeka> MootPoot that's sensible, I'd definitely focus the search on local companies who are probably thinking things like "we might transition back to in-person work at some point eventually maybe"
[00:26:04] <teus> ive turned down a job, where they wanted me to start next monday, 200 euro above unemployment
[00:26:09] <emmeka> teus sounds like any other country, really.
[00:26:27] <MootPoot> I'd code for free really
[00:26:28] <teus> i got no clue how much unemployment outside of west-europe is
[00:26:30] <MootPoot> I'm just fucking mored
[00:26:32] <emmeka> lol at the idea that you can turn down a job and still get unemployment in US/Canada
[00:26:36] <MootPoot> bored*
[00:26:40] <emmeka> that's not how it works here, so
[00:26:46] <teus> yes i get that
[00:26:49] <teus> but here i have that luxury
[00:27:07] <MootPoot> emmeka: you cant turn down a job which dosen't pay you enough?
[00:27:21] <MootPoot> like if you need 30/h to pay for all your shit or house/apt
[00:27:29] <MootPoot> and you get an offer for a min wage job
[00:27:34] <emmeka> MootPoot not like I'm the expert but isn't the usual approach here just do FOSS shit, and then you have more things to grease a resume/portfolio with?
[00:27:43] <teus> over here, it depends if youre being "coached" by the unemployment office
[00:28:05] *** Joins: newwebdev13 (~newwebdev@31.210.55.150)
[00:28:12] <emmeka> MootPoot no. you can't turn down any offer of employment on EI that is fulltime.
[00:28:20] <MootPoot> emmeka: doing a little on the side - but its a little hard to just get into a random FOSS project
[00:28:24] <teus> emmeka: EI?
[00:28:33] <MootPoot> note most of my skills are for stuff that FOSS projects dont use
[00:28:36] <emmeka> teus employment insurance. Canadian unemployment system.
[00:28:58] <teus> hmm. that would mean employers communicate with the EI ?
[00:29:11] <emmeka> no, but you do. you have to file weekly reports.
[00:29:19] <emmeka> and if you *lie* to EI things go very badly
[00:29:24] <teus> thats nice
[00:29:40] <teus> over here we have bums who work for 2 years, get unmployed for 40 years and then retire with full benefits

[00:30:22] <teus> nope
[00:30:23] <emmeka> EI has a fixed duration here, dependent on your length of employment. You can't stay on it forever. Usually only a few months, at maximum up to just over a year.

[00:32:09] <teus> belgium
[00:32:12] <emmeka> in this context I mean fired as in terminated with cause. When you're laid off (job loss due to downsizing, business closure, end of contract, whatever) you get EI
[00:32:16] <teus> thats what you get with the socialist rats 
[00:32:31] <teus> emmeka: ah yes, same here. terminated with urgency is no unemployment
[00:32:45] <MootPoot> I remember reading a whole deal about "wellfare parasites" and "welfare queens" in the US - then an actual study pointed out there were like maybe 0.83% of them in total
[00:32:53] <teus> but if youre fired for being a lazy bum, you get full benefits
[00:32:59] <emmeka> teus not here.
[00:33:12] <emmeka> also lol at Belgium being socialist
[00:33:23] <teus> the angle is pretty specific
[00:33:32] <teus> socialism is good, but the local socialists are awful

[01:08:02] <teus> by the time the belgian government became the "owner", it was in  a very, very bad state
[01:08:22] <teus> and plenty of congo infrastructure nowadays dates back from that era, not much was built ever after
[01:09:09] <teus> im not aware of the king "running out of money" when setting up the colony

[01:14:09] <Urchin[emacs]> teus: my main source about it is from Adam Hochschild's book King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa
[01:14:33] <teus> then you must know  a lot more than m
[01:14:33] <teus> e
[01:15:22] <Urchin[emacs]> teus: well, after Belgians plotted to kill Lumumba and a dictator favoring personal suitcase of cash deals was installed, it was natural that the country didn't progress afterwards

[05:24:33] <MootPoot> "some military strategist said it was a good idea to bomb the largest nuke plant in europe in the same cuntry with the largest nuclear disaster of all time?"  - maybe more like "I lost communications with my commander, lets just take this power plant for now and hang out here"
[05:24:47] <Nanobot> I thought she would do things that look bad, but it's actually a bait-and-switch presentation and isn't bad. But.... she just does bad things and says she's barely safe.
[05:24:52] <MootPoot> sounds like more of a fog of war thing
[05:24:56] <Sapphirus> Yeah, like shelling it and starting it on fire.
[05:25:20] <Sapphirus> There's more to it than just that.
[05:26:01] <MootPoot> I don't think he's THAT off the rails...yet at least
[05:26:41] <Sapphirus> Oh, I think he is, given what is currently happening.
[05:27:35] <Nanobot> He says they aren't at war, and Ukraine is run by Nazis, and the people of Ukraine are greeting the Russians as liberators, and no Russians have died (until they finally just recently announced a few had died).

[07:47:18] <amigojapan> MootPoot: are you wearing a suit when you get an interview? clean shaved? that may also be influencing the results for alal I know, H&R is stupid
[07:47:18] <davic> Roey: no
[07:47:26] <davic> more like ruby and perl having babies
[07:47:34] <davic> with a slight touch of Erlang
[07:47:34] <Roey> lol
[07:47:56] <Roey> it has that "I wanna be different, so here" attitude
[07:47:57] <davic> Roey: basically it's as close to Ruby as possible so it's an easy switch but way better than Ruby

[07:54:31] <MootPoot> not passing them

[07:54:42] <Sapphirus> Well our job market is shit
[07:55:35] <amigojapan> I see MootPoot, you may want to consider relocating
[07:55:47] <Sapphirus> And if you aren't in one of the few tech hubs in Canada, then your chances are not good.
[07:56:19] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: unless he can get a remote job i guess
[07:56:40] <Sapphirus> Yeah, that's true, but he'd have to search for something like that.

[10:35:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> commit-count is a silly metric.
[10:35:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You could create a script to inflate it by splitting every commit diffline.
[10:36:10] <KirisameMarisa> Russia's economy hasn't exploded to the point of a wave of unemployment (at least... It's better than Japan in the late 1990s)

[10:54:40] <MootPoot> Okay prebuilts are shit 
[10:54:53] <MootPoot> About 1200 for a i9 pc
[10:55:09] <smallville7123> if i have a normalized delta, how would i use that to calculate a new location in a view space? eg from x 162 with delta x 0, to x 410 with delta x 0.2
[10:55:57] <Satin> MootPoot: that's bad?
[10:56:00] <Satin> isn't i9 really good
[10:56:02] <MootPoot> Urchin[emacs]: you may be tsun to me but I still dere you 
[10:56:07] <Satin> actually i don't know anything about i9s
[10:56:19] * Satin is used to laptop prices being 1200 with i7
[10:56:31] <MootPoot> Satin: the newer ones have wonky core setups 
[10:56:38] <Satin> wdym
[10:56:48] <Bco1981> big/little
[10:56:52] <Satin> o
[10:56:54] <MootPoot> There are 16 cores
[10:56:58] <Bco1981> requires windows 11
[10:57:11] <Bco1981> to run properly
[10:57:20] <MootPoot> How is Linux alder lake looking
[10:57:28] <Bco1981> haven't heard
[10:57:31] <MootPoot> Bad or worse 
[10:57:58] <Bco1981> thou, personally i would avoid the E-cores. this generation. just to be safe.
[10:58:01] <Satin>  i'm so nervous about this calc exam
[10:58:04] <KirisameMarisa> Haswell here(cry)
[10:58:05] <Satin> it's at 9 am
[10:58:06] <Bco1981> so 12600 is the max
[10:58:10] <Satin> and it's 12:30 am rn
[10:58:15] <Satin> i have 8 hours to study and revise
[10:58:21] * Satin stress.jpeg
[10:58:21] <MootPoot> Bco1981: I want a pc to replace my crappy arch laptop but
[10:58:32] <MootPoot> I can't justify it yet
[10:58:44] <MootPoot> Not while Gpu prices are shit 
[10:58:53] <Satin> that old msi laptop?
[10:58:56] <MootPoot> And alder lake issues
[10:59:08] <MootPoot> And no job
[10:59:12] <MootPoot> Satin: ye
[10:59:15] <smallville7123> the delta is calculated from ns_touch.NormalizedPosition, and im trying to convert it to a window space or view space delta
[10:59:21] <Bco1981> aslong as you stay at 12600 it's only p-cores
[10:59:34] <MootPoot> Displaport to external monitor keeps going black now
[10:59:43] <MootPoot> Idk wtf is going on
[11:00:29] <MootPoot> What I would like is an i9 12700 sff or itx with a amd gpu
[11:00:47] <MootPoot> But ill settle for a i5 with no Gpu 
[11:00:48] <Bco1981> but the 12700 has Ecores too
[11:01:05] <MootPoot> I know. I want it but it makes no sense
[11:01:19] <MootPoot> I want a ryzen but no gpus to be found
[11:01:28] <Bco1981> well you can disable them, depending on the motherboard features.
[11:01:32] <MootPoot> So probably a i5 12400
[11:01:35] <MootPoot> With sff
[11:01:53] <Satin> rff -= ?
[11:01:57] <Satin> sff*

[11:04:03] <MootPoot> My Nas has a i5 9400
[11:04:04] <Bco1981> yes, price/performance and no ecores
[11:04:05] <MootPoot> Lol
[11:04:13] <Bco1981> and a igpu
[11:04:30] <MootPoot> Not sure if igpu can do 1440p 144hz
[11:04:45] <MootPoot> On dp
[11:04:48] <Bco1981> probably not 144hz in games. maybe on the desktop
[11:04:55] <KirisameMarisa> MootPoot: Your NAS is more powerful than my mainframe (cry)
[11:05:53] <MootPoot> Bco1981: yeah, I got it because it was marginally more then the 60hz one due to covid 
[11:06:16] <MootPoot> Wonk shipping 
[11:06:31] <MootPoot> Not like I'll play games on it.... Probably 
[11:06:43] <MootPoot> Maybe if Sadale moves in with me

[11:13:03] <Bco1981> i want a 5800x3d for myself. then i can use my current 5800x for my sons upgrade. but. chances are the 5800x3d becomes the next 3300x the one no pne could get.
[11:13:28] <Bco1981> no one*
[11:13:49] <MootPoot> Wonder how good the Vega igpu is vs the alder lake one
[11:13:57] <MootPoot> Actually 
[11:14:16] <MootPoot> I wonder about Linux support for those new intel graphics cards
[11:14:38] <Bco1981> reviews say the intel 770 is half the time on par. and the other half... only half the performance.
[11:14:55] <Sapphirus> Intel's iGPUs generally are very mediocre 
[11:15:12] <Sapphirus> Driver support on Linux for Intel iGPUs is generally better than Windows.
[11:15:27] <Sapphirus> You can still use a 10+ year-old machine with official driver support from Intel.
[11:15:45] <Sapphirus> Why you would want to do that is another question, but it's a thing.
[11:17:41] <Bco1981> 10+ year old intel igpu yeah, nope.
[11:18:03] <KirisameMarisa> I only want to buy a HD7400......
[11:18:09] <Bco1981> but 14+ year old flagship cpu. damn that thing was a beast back then.
[11:18:52] <Bco1981> works perfectly fine today, thou it is a bit overclocked. but i could use it as my daily pc.
[11:20:04] <Bco1981> core2quad 3.0ghz overclocked to 3.6ghz, it's amazing it is still snappy and doesn't feel slow doing daily tasks/1080p60 video/streaming
[11:20:45] <Bco1981> no exotic cooling, just a tower cooler with 1 fan.

[18:09:04] <JesseDesu> why are you so popular
[18:09:07] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah but I think Urchin wants to share something with me each time, and I do appreciate it anyway
[18:09:11] <JesseDesu> how can i become popular
[18:09:20] <TsundereNoises> JesseDesu: I don't know, but I had the month from hell and it was nice to come back to that

[18:11:23] <Bco1981> got the new phone, time for backup and data transfer.
[18:11:35] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I mean, there can only be so much handholding before the censors crack down on it you know
[18:11:51] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: like that one with two girls in separate desks with a maid each 
[18:12:32] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: getting used to new devices is surprisingly tough!
[18:12:45] <TsundereNoises> I've been coasting on the same old tech for so long, I'm like an old person now
[18:13:09] <Bco1981> yeah, my "old" phone still works but is 6 years old

[18:16:04] <TsundereNoises> yes exactly
[18:16:24] <TsundereNoises> I'm wondering if there is a flip phone that would still work?

[18:18:23] <Bco1981> great, the phone is on polish... and before i could select a different language it's asking me something...
[18:18:25] <TsundereNoises> Is there even a real reason to do that, or just to force phone upgrades?
[18:18:33] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: there are 5g flip phones in Japan

[18:39:28] <TsundereNoises> I've been worried about it
[18:39:34] <TsundereNoises> Now I'm starting to worry about Taiwan honestly
[18:40:38] <Sadale> The situation's a bit different. Formally speaking, Taiwai has been a part of China. Both ROC anc PRC claims that there's only one China. But there're two different interpretations.
[18:41:49] <TsundereNoises> it's different in terms of what people call it, but PRC would still like to occupy Taiwan, and depending on the response to Ukraine, it might be something they don't hold off on anymore
[18:42:15] <TsundereNoises> although at least Taiwan has defense treaties with USA/Japan/etc so they aren't quite as diplomatically isolated
[18:45:45] <TsundereNoises> !later tell Urchin[emacs] https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp6192378.jpg
[18:48:01] <Sadale> Let's hope that the next leader in Taiwan would be more friendly to PRC so that PRC wouldn't be at rage and send troop to Taiwan.
[18:48:37] <TsundereNoises> I guess that's one way of looking at it...
[18:48:55] <Sadale> I still don't think there'd be a war over Taiwan tho. Even PRC's relying on it for advanced chip and shit.

[22:55:02] <MootPoot> :3
[22:55:19] <TsundereNoises> on that note, is it worth triple the file size for 1080 vs 720 for Princess Connect! ReDive, I have this debate a lot
[22:55:33] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: they're pretty different, but I like both
[22:55:34] <MootPoot> meh

[22:55:52] <MootPoot> it was shit all three times
[22:55:59] <TsundereNoises> I don't know, I haven't seen it
[22:56:02] <MootPoot> its like a shitty konosuba
[22:56:05] <TsundereNoises> but I have been informed that I should watch it
[22:56:07] <MootPoot> that's even more boring
[22:56:13] <TsundereNoises> and I am finally downloading anime again
[22:56:24] <MootPoot> I was also told to do it 
[22:56:28] <MootPoot> by stan or somebody
[22:56:29] <MootPoot> idk
[22:56:32] <MootPoot> but its shite
[22:56:38] <TsundereNoises> anyway, I'll take that as an argument for 720p and 1/3 file size
[22:56:50] <TsundereNoises> I mean, I can't watch it until I download it
[22:57:02] <MootPoot> its based on a mobile game - I wasen't expecting much and even I was disappointed then
[22:57:36] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: you remember konosuba right?
[22:58:00] <MootPoot> now remove the good writing and humor, remove any depth of character, and remove any actual good character interactions or world building
[22:58:26] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I've never heard of Konosuba
[22:58:32] <MootPoot> wow same
[22:58:37] <MootPoot> neither have I

[22:58:52] <MootPoot> no, YOU are impressive
[22:58:57] <TsundereNoises> anyawy I can't argue because I haven't seen the show, but a few different people wanted me to watch it and I promised I'd try it
[22:58:58] <emmeka> huh.
[22:59:03] <TsundereNoises> it's the first in my notes of shit I should watch
[22:59:06] <emmeka> I'm going to get an insurance payout.
[22:59:13] <MootPoot> emmeka: big money man
[22:59:23] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: you took out an insurance policy on my streak of not watching anime?
[22:59:40] <MootPoot> my tax refund is going to be like 5k or something
[22:59:43] <MootPoot> I dont know how either
[23:00:07] <emmeka> I had life insurance included in my mortgage with my credit union. This I knew about.
[23:00:16] <emmeka> I had somehow forgotten this included disability insurance
[23:00:34] <emmeka> but my mortgage advisor didn't, and I'm currently in the process of getting a home equity line of credit
[23:00:41] <Nanobot> Gura draws a butt and a penis on a van. JP-bros: "So cute!"
[23:00:53] <emmeka> and she's like "your wife was disabled all of last year??? you didn't claim your insurance???"
[23:00:57] <emmeka> and I'm like uhhhhhh
[23:01:09] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: to be fair, if Nene draws a butt on something in Japanese, I'd think it was super cute too
[23:01:12] <MootPoot> >home equity line of credit
[23:01:17] <MootPoot> wuz dat
[23:01:31] <MootPoot> if you dont pay if off they tak a ur home?
[23:01:35] <TsundereNoises> it's interesting how drawing butts is apparently language dependent now
[23:01:41] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: She can't do that unless the Yuru Yuri artist does it first.
[23:03:07] <MootPoot> emmeka:  so uh
[23:03:21] <MootPoot> emmeka: expanding into the weed business now?
[23:03:30] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: she hasn't just drawn Nene, she also drew Gura, Korone, a few others

[23:04:06] <MootPoot> I wonder- I dont smoke weed but
[23:04:13] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: I'm referring to the whole thing where Nene was caught plagiarizing the Yuru Yuri artist and had to apologize
[23:04:14] <MootPoot> wonder if covid amped up the weed business
[23:04:20] <emmeka> MootPoot yes, they exercise a lien on your house if you don't pay a home equity line of credit
[23:04:30] <MootPoot> emmeka: kowaii
[23:04:34] <MootPoot> dont get that
[23:04:35] <MootPoot> wtf
[23:04:37] <emmeka> which is why they're very very low interest.
[23:04:45] <MootPoot> No!
[23:04:46] <emmeka> which is why they're generally handy.
[23:04:51] <emmeka> same as a mortgage...
[23:04:51] <MootPoot> but
[23:05:07] <MootPoot> yeah but mortgage is becuase you dont own your house completely yet
[23:05:07] <emmeka> I mean right now my mortgage is like 3 full percentage points below inflation, the bank is basically giving me money
[23:05:17] <TsundereNoises> so emmeka, are you growing any interesting squash?
[23:06:02] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Getter Robo Go | Episode: 5
[23:06:47] <emmeka> TsundereNoises I grow pattypans every year, and try only a few winter squash here and there. My favourite for the winter squashes so far is delicata, but I came across an early kabocha I may try.
[23:07:22] <emmeka> but my season is somewhat short for squashes, so I have to be choosey with varieties
[23:08:14] <emmeka> best short seasons I've come across have been bush delicata, golden nugget (a buttercup/kabocha type), and REBA acorn.
[23:08:15] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: I had missed that bit of drama, but looking into it, Nene used a drawing of hers as a twitter icon, apologized, and then Namori (the artist) made her official twitter icon
[23:09:01] <Poeticode> i wanna grow tea but I hear it takes years before the first harvest and you gotta learn how to prepare it properly :( goal for future me when I give up on society and hide in the suburbs

[23:34:29] <Nanobot> Nene's apology happened after her birthday

[23:37:20] <MootPoot> 1.) yes , I dont try because 2.) A squashlover kept on feeding me squash and it was meh or shit every time

[23:38:29] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: you have not, also MISSION ACCOPLISHED, we're talking about non-weed crops
[23:38:37] <emmeka> TsundereNoises the golden nuggets are nice from a production standpoint, they're bush type, very early, very productive. They're tiny, but effectively identical in flavour and use to buttercups.
[23:38:46] <MootPoot> weed squash
[23:39:03] <emmeka> the guy who made the variety was some dude in North Dakota who wanted "sweet potato you could grow in the north"
[23:39:04] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: want to get some rope and squash and head over to MootPoot's house?
[23:39:15] <emmeka> sounds like a great Friday night
[23:39:19] <MootPoot> w-what's the rope for
[23:39:33] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: with the golden nuggets aren't they a bit more of a pain just in terms of amount of flesh to skin?
[23:39:52] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: in case you try to escape
[23:40:01] <emmeka> TsundereNoises nah, they're actually great because they're small enough that a half squash is 1 nice serving
[23:40:05] <emmeka> so just halve, roast
[23:40:27] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I guess part of it is I've never had a desire for a 1-serving squash
[23:40:27] <emmeka> and they're not ridged, so they're easier to peel than many things if that's the use
[23:40:35] <TsundereNoises> oh, smooth would be easier
[23:40:40] <MootPoot> wonder if anyone managed to unintentionally breed or modify a strain of vegetable into a poisonous one
[23:40:57] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: although usually I just chop them in half with a cleaver and scrape out the flesh after they roast
[23:41:06] <TsundereNoises> put a bit of butter and maple syrup in the middle as they cook

[23:41:58] <emmeka> MootPoot sure. humans select for these things, even.
[23:42:09] <emmeka> oddly enough, cyanide is overrepresented in domestic crops. 
[23:42:26] <emmeka> it's rare in nature, but common in things we farm... because it kills pests? maybe?
[23:43:39] <emmeka> MootPoot this is a common problem in cassava-producing countries, cassava naturally contains cyanide, usually not much, but occasional selections are made which contain a lot and it can be stressed into producing more of it in bad years

[23:45:22] <TsundereNoises> does extreme UV sensitivity count as poison, because we've definitely increased that in a few citrus haven't we (like bergamont?)
[23:45:38] <emmeka> TsundereNoises probs, also consider buckwheat
[23:45:47] <TsundereNoises> I love buckwheat
[23:46:06] <emmeka> which can cause a photo-sensitivity syndrome when eaten in large quantities
[23:46:22] <emmeka> and we don't really have a good grasp on varieties/landraces that cause this

[23:54:07] <ButterNoodle> yea human nature is to double down and just get 2 laptops

[23:54:20] <MootPoot> my NAS is

[23:54:56] <Bco1981> tablet or phone, maybe
[23:54:56] <TsundereNoises> I'd never sleep if I did

[23:55:07] <TsundereNoises> I have a book, and if I get sick of reading I go the fuck to sleep

[23:55:14] <MootPoot> :3
[23:55:21] <TsundereNoises> or I stay up in the other room using the computer, but then it's more a conscious choice
