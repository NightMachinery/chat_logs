[13:40:33] <emanuele6> that works
[13:40:42] <no_gravity> And what do you mean with "r" and "f"?
[13:41:12] <emanuele6> then you move the line of the temporary commit right after the line of the commit you want to amend
[13:41:49] <emanuele6> now you replace the word "pick" in the line that you moved with "f" (that stands for fixup)
[13:42:03] *** milosz_ is now known as milosz
[13:42:15] <no_gravity> I see. That is similar to what I do in my script.
[13:42:28] <emanuele6> if you want to also edit the commit text, you replace the word "pick" in the line of the commit you want to amend with "reword"
[13:42:34] <no_gravity> Your approach is similar to these two lines in my script:
[13:42:39] <no_gravity> git commit --fixup $hash
[13:42:44] <no_gravity> GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase -i --autosquash $hash^
[13:43:08] <emanuele6> otherwise you just leave pick and it will squash the two commits together without opening a second editor
[13:43:30] <emanuele6> yes, $hash^ and $hash~ are synonymous
[13:44:51] <no_gravity> I tend to call it "ammend-to-old.sh"

[20:53:41] <humanface> hi all
[20:54:17] <humanface> if I have committed a change to a branch, but I don't push now, and I switch to a different branch and I commit a different change on there
[20:54:36] <humanface> then if I push on that branch, will I accidentally push the previous change too, or only the second change?
[20:54:55] <humanface> does Git pushes only the commited change for that exact branch?

I've added my public key, but I am still being prompted for a password when I attempt to clone. The key works, I can try to login as git@host and get the message as expected. I've updated my ssh config file to reflect the key in use, but still get

[22:28:39] <imMute> 2) it's not using your ssh key, that's why it's asking for the git user's password

[22:29:10] <imMute> I always use an ssh-agent, so IDK what the default behavior is without it, but I Think your key has to be named ~/.ssh/id_rsa or something for it to get picked up automatically
