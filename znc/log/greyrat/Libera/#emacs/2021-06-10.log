[00:06:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It doesn't though.
[00:07:03] <jrm> rpav: It's probably less expensive than the emacs backups.  The old blocks on disk just aren't cleared until you delete the snapshot, so it's just block-level differences.  So, if you change one byte in the file, you only store an extra block or so on disk.  Deleting snapshots can trash the disk though, so I just do that in a cronjob at 04:00.
[00:07:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It only marks a point where modifications write extents at different areas instead.

[00:16:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm not sure if COW actually makes a difference on SSDs, given that you can't really ever be sure it writes any blocks in-place even if you use filesystems that would do so on HDDs.

[00:17:36] <rpav> i don't think cow is likely to anymore than writing a new block would?
[00:18:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I mean, on HDDs the same blocks would be reused without CoW, but on SSDs you can't ever guarantee that in the first place.
[00:18:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So CoW on SSDs only makes explicit the implicit move.

[03:21:27] <grym> aidalgol: registration of a CLI entry point
[03:21:51] <grym> that's the function that gets hit when you invoke it as a cli tool
[03:21:57] <aidalgol> grym: huh...
[03:22:00] <grym> typer's nice
[03:22:26] <aidalgol> Is that the new way of doing if __name__ == "__main__": ...  ?
[03:22:28] <grym> no
[03:22:35] <grym> i use entry_points for that
[03:23:04] <aidalgol> huh...
[03:23:07] <johnjay> wasamasa: have you done experiments on emacs responsiveness in different modes like with fontifying and such?
[03:23:28] <johnjay> apparently the idea is for UI actions to always take < .1s
[03:23:34] <johnjay> er ideal
[03:23:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> @whatever is a decorator.
[03:23:42] <aidalgol> johnjay: sez who?
[03:24:18] <grym> aidalgol: anyway, you'd invoke this as `whatever_name --pw <something> --user <something> --vpn-ip <something> ...` 
[03:24:23] <johnjay> says science.
[03:24:25] <johnjay> https://www.nngroup.com/articles/powers-of-10-time-scales-in-ux/
[03:24:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> @app.command()'s kinda weird though because I'm used to registering Python entrypoints in the setup.py
[03:24:31] <grym> and `whatever_name --help` tells you how to use it and is autogenerated, etc. 
[03:24:59] <grym> Aurora_v_kosmose: i still do, but in pyproject.toml there's a [poetry.scripts] foo = "package.__main__:app" thingie
[03:25:02] <johnjay> what i was recalling was a post by steve yegge about trying to hack js2-mode in emacs so that it instantly recompiled while you typed or something
[03:25:02] <johnjay> i don't remember the exact thing
[03:25:02] <grym> same deal
[03:25:22] <aidalgol> grym: OK, and why is this preferable to the if-name-main convention with argparse?
[03:25:34] <grym> aidalgol: because argparse sucks?
[03:25:38] <johnjay> so i was thinking about maybe having a timer running every .05 sec in emacs that runs gcc <file> on your file so you don't have to hit the compile command
[03:25:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> grym: What lib allows for this to work?
[03:25:58] <grym> Aurora_v_kosmose: https://typer.tiangolo.com/

[03:26:25] <grym> no, the other kind of type

[03:26:50] <aidalgol> grym: Dude, I work with C++ for a living.
[03:26:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That explains that much.

[03:28:07] <aidalgol> ah, neat!

[05:18:23] <grym> i read some early reviews, saw the crap they'd slapped onto it, moved on 
[05:19:29] <technomancy> I kinda lost the ability to enjoy batman when I thought for like more than 5 minutes about how messed up it is to have a rich guy who solves crime by punching criminals
[05:20:22] <aidalgol> technomancy: This is why I maintain that the best incarnation is the camp 1960s version.
[05:20:29] <technomancy> see also http://wondermark.com/939/
[05:20:33] <grym> "exactly how broken of a human is this" is a theme that's all across the spectrum there
[05:20:37] <technomancy> aidalgol: I respect that
[05:20:54] <aidalgol> technomancy: IOW, I cannot take the concept seriously, and everyone should stop trying to do so.

[05:26:02] <aidalgol> Some of the British ones are genuinely uncomfortable for me to listen to, because you can hear every breath, every rubbing of the clothing as the actors move, and all the dialogue sounds like it was delivered 3mm from the microphone.

[10:18:11] <twb> "without blocking input" as in you still have an interactive python REPL?
[10:18:23] <Ando> Yeah precisely
[10:18:32] <Ando> I miss my CL REPL :(
[10:19:18] <Ando> When I start the flask app, it blocks so C-c C-c doesn't work any more
[10:19:29] <twb> flask's default setup won't work that way
[10:19:33] <twb> it's a purely flask question
[10:19:48] <twb> you have to bypass the outermost part of flask's framework and create the listener part yourself
[10:19:54] <twb> I don't know offhand how to do that
[10:20:07] <Ando> Sure thing, thanks for the help

[13:18:18] <retux> I'm now using (setq whitespace-hspace-regexp "[[:graph:]]\\( +\\)[[:graph:]]"). It seems to match with my definition of "word".

[14:37:02] <YoungFrog> info mode is ok here (but I didn't update emacs recently). when laggy mode happens I tend to ,,tdoq,, and hit C-g while it's slow, hoping to get a useful backtrace. You can also gather more info by activating the profiler. (M-x profiler-start then, some time later, M-x profiler-report)
[14:37:03] <fsbot> tdoq: M-x toggle-debug-on-quit RET, reproduce the infinite loop or sluggishness, then type C-g, then lisppaste the contents of the backtrace buffer.

[22:40:01] <Pio> i moved my config to a new machine and now when i enable elpy all my python buffers have funky line spacing inserted.. but like the line-spacing variable is nil.. if i sit it non-nill, it just adds more line spacing on top of whats already there.. does anyone know what might cause the addition of line spacing outside of the line-spacing variable?

IIRC it doesn't insert newlines but it does do a surprisingly good job of indenting SQL otherwise.  I don't use it anymore because of course it doesn't indent all the SQL exactly the way I want, but I did use it for a good long time and I was impressed at how thorough it is.

[23:28:29] <natter> I suppose you could redefine it briefly to prevent centering and see if that works, since you can insert it yourself. I don't see how it isn't working off hand but I don't really get some of the make-button and propertize stuff works
