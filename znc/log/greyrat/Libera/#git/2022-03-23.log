[00:40:53] <infogulch> Hi! I was inspired by this pie chart showing language usage breakdown for the firefox repo ( https://4e6.github.io/firefox-lang-stats/ ). I was curious what that breakdown would look like over time, so I ran the stats on the repo for one commit every week since 1995 and got this: https://infogulch.github.io/firefox-lang-stats/
[00:41:15] *** Joins: ghost43 (~ghost43@gateway/tor-sasl/ghost43)
[00:44:12] <infogulch> I noticed that my stacked area graph looks "spiky", and after investigation it seems that the method I used to "choose one commit every week" did not account for multiple root commits. I believe what happening is that sometimes it chooses a commit from one root, and sometimes it chooses from another root. This is the script I used to generate the
[00:44:12] <infogulch> data: https://github.com/infogulch/lang-stats/blob/master/lang-stats.sh

[00:46:57] <ikke> infogulch: so this command is giving the 'random' result?
[00:46:59] <ikke> git rev-list --max-parents=0 --format="format:%cI %H" --no-commit-header "$BRANCH"
[00:47:41] <infogulch> No that consistently gives the oldest root commit (along with the rest of the line)

[03:42:23] <phox> tricks question:  is there an easy way to determine which local branches' tips are ancestors of a specific commit (usually mainline tip but...)?  basically to determine which refs I can drop for housekeeping without losing unmerged work
[03:43:13] *** Joins: k_sze (~k_sze@mail2.kalunite.net)
[03:43:16] <phox> also I've been thinking about writing a patch to retain merge parents on rebase, e.g. for not losing ancestry when rebasing mainline before a push, but is that already a thing somehow?

After that I commited a new change to my local branch I used git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name> and the Branch was recreated. There is no conflict between my new "old" branch and the branch I'm trying to merge into, but Github still can't auto merge. Any ideas as to why? :)
