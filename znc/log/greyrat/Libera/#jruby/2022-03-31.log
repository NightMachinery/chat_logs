[18:20:19] <headius> good morning
[18:20:48] <headius> still waiting on ostruct update so I pinged marcandre
[18:21:02] <headius> jcodings update should fix a couple unicode version checks once it merges to master: https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/7163
[18:29:09] <headius> M1 runners seem to be down ðŸ¤”
[19:40:49] <headius> enebo: not sure I agree with this but...
[19:40:51] * headius sent a code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/793e425de33a8e2a8e977cfd72028a7a77f62016
[19:41:12] <headius> we aren't going to maintain separate branches of jcodings so this may just need to be tagged off
[19:41:39] <headius> this and UNICODE_VERSION fail on my jcodings update branch
[19:54:10] <headius> I hope this is all that's needed to get arm64 images out there: https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/pull/12163
[20:56:41] <headius> M1 instance is back up and clearing backlog
[20:56:46] <headius> not sure why it got stuck
[21:56:13] <headius> CI updated from Java 16 to 17, jcodings merged, ostruct fix released and updated, and 9.3 merged back to master
[23:14:53] <byteit101[m]> > headius: I don't have a mac or hadoop to test, but I think this can be closed https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/2359
[23:14:53] <byteit101[m]> headius: fyi ^
[23:43:17] <headius> ah yes indeed
