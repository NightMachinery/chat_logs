[00:05:42] <rawtaz> its the simplest, thats all. ssh cant be used everywhere, but https is rarely an issue
[00:09:02] <rawtaz> thanks for verifying. not sure what that person was on when suggesting you can use ssh keys over https..
[00:09:17] <rawtaz> perhaps they were thinking of ssh over https in general, rather than github specific
[00:09:23] <DoofusCanadensis> github is username + token
[00:09:47] <rawtaz> yeah. which is silly when you store the token the same was as the password anyway
[00:10:03] <DoofusCanadensis> I know people who hosted their ssh service at port 80

[01:59:11] <rawtaz> not sure what you mean. if oyu have a repo, you have a repo :D

[02:07:27] <rawtaz> Linkandzelda: are you writing the wiki software yourself and like calling git behind the scenes for when people make and save edits?
[02:08:47] <Linkandzelda> rawtaz: not quite, just that the wiki is in vim, and vim will automatically commit the edits while in the wiki environment. its up to other collaborators to manage their own wiki commits
[02:09:59] <rawtaz> so basically it's all just about a ext editor that does commits with git when you save hte file? wiki or not wiki isnt relevant
[02:11:40] <Linkandzelda> rawtaz: yep, it could just as well be a huge doc or even txt file. since i havent done it i dont know what problems i will face but my mind which is used to having 1 repo per 1 thing, makes me think something could go wrong quick, but hopefully not
[02:12:35] <mackerman> If the text is to be maintained sperate from the project, not tied to a given version, that could mean seperate repos make more sense.
[02:12:38] <Linkandzelda> thats why i was researching things like "how to have a repo inside a repo", which lead me to learning about subrepo and then monorepos. and i like the idea of monorepos better
[02:12:51] <mackerman> Why does it have to be in the same tree at all?
[02:13:39] <rawtaz> i dont get it. if it's a bunch of files that are supposed to be edited in one and the same context, then its fine with having it all in one repo. its like you have one repo for wikipedia. there's no point in having one repo per page :>
[02:14:19] <Linkandzelda> mackerman: the thing is, the project could be branched off in any number of experiments with the wiki being the center of it. thats just very confusing if the wiki content isnt in the project
[02:15:05] <mackerman> Sure. Which confuses me that you asked how to seperate the wiki from the project.
[02:15:45] <rawtaz> bleh. keep it simple. start editing. if you need to move some contents to some other place or whatever out of the repo, you can do that later
[02:16:05] <Linkandzelda> and the wiki is the only source of truth on the direction of the project in its current state. i suppose what i meant by that, say i have main branch and branch experiment, i'd want to maybe work on the same branch or read the documentation on that branch while working on the main branch
[02:16:09] <rawtaz> i dont know how it works if you want to replace a path that is versioned with a subrepo instead though, will there be a conflict?
[02:16:48] <Linkandzelda> rawtaz: im not sure, but every "sub repo" thing i found seems like a huge hack and pain to manage

[02:19:34] <Linkandzelda> am i right in thinking that if i switch to another branch which has the wiki content i want, it will also switch the working directory to that branch? so its basically not possible to read that + work on the main branch without having a copy? or is there a way

[02:20:11] <Linkandzelda> michigan: hi :)
[02:20:15] <mackerman> When you branch experiment from main, it has wiki docs also the point of branching. They come along if they are part of the tree.
[02:20:27] <ZacSharp65> you can have as many branches as you want checked out simultaneously in different clones of the same repo or in different worktrees of the same clone

[02:25:46] <Linkandzelda> still seems like its similar or the same to switching branch since the working directory content still changes completely?

[13:27:07] <Lope> bookworm, well, perhaps revert is the wrong terminology
[13:27:16] <Lope> basically I made a WIP commit like 6 commits back
[13:27:31] <Lope> since then I've basically merged staging into my branch about 5 times.

[13:30:40] <Lope> I'm going to try it.

[14:24:20] <mdk> shad: Just change the creds.
[14:25:12] <shad> :<
[14:26:30] <dviola> you could also squash all the commits in that branch to 1 commit, git reset HEAD^ to undo the commit and keep the changes, then git add/commit carefully... but then you lose your history
[14:27:39] <dviola> I second mdk suggestion
[14:27:47] <shad> the branch only has 1 commit now, the one commit i want to nuke

[14:32:56] <dviola> shad: in that case, git reset HEAD^ to undo the last commit, remove the unwanted changes, git add files, git commit, git push --force origin branch
[14:33:15] <dviola> but you should be careful with force, make sure nobody else is working on it
[14:33:38] <dviola> you should still change your creds
[14:34:19] <mannequin> yes, lifer, idd, don't expect anything else

[19:38:57] <jancoow> how can I solve this?
[19:40:12] <DoofusCanadensis> I've seen that happen with a repo created on a case-insensitive file system where the case of the filename changed
[19:40:48] <jancoow> it's not that. There are parts of the code changed

[19:41:03] <jancoow> Im on linux now but it is commited on windows
[19:41:25] <jancoow> or well, the file was edited in my windows virtual machine on my linux file system

[21:27:12] <imMute> Kobaz: short answer: don't do that.
[21:27:16] <Kobaz> i know
[21:27:23] <Kobaz> but, if I wanted to...
[21:28:01] <DoofusCanadensis> give them their own account on the server
[21:28:06] <Kobaz> there's a method to the madness
[21:28:18] <Kobaz> yeah i was thinking of that, and then su -p to keep the original user info
[21:28:27] <DoofusCanadensis> no
[21:28:41] <DoofusCanadensis> just their own account, let them clone into their work directory
[21:28:49] <DoofusCanadensis> fetch and push commits

[21:29:28] <Kobaz> apache configs, whatever
[21:29:40] <Kobaz> typically each developer has their own vm, so everything is self-contained
[21:29:43] <DoofusCanadensis> deploy to production, don't edit in place
[21:29:47] <Kobaz> but then the unit testing server... anyone can log into
[21:29:59] <mackerman> Write automation scripts, rather than making the work tree itself the config files.
[21:30:16] <DoofusCanadensis> unit tests should be done on developer machines

[23:08:30] <SnowCode> Why did you ask me this?
[23:09:09] <ikke> SnowCode: our experience tought us to verify everything
[23:09:24] <SnowCode> You wanted to verify I had only one branch?
[23:09:32] <ikke> and no tags
[23:09:35] <SnowCode> oh ok
[23:10:19] <osse> If you do a separate clone, is that also bigger than expected? Or is it approx as big as the one you have locally now?
[23:11:03] <SnowCode> Is there a way I can now the size of a clone without cloning (to spare time and space on my device)
[23:11:05] <SnowCode> ?
[23:11:21] <osse> Not that I know of
[23:11:24] <SnowCode> OK
[23:11:25] <osse> I can clone it if you want
[23:11:51] <SnowCode> No imma do it
[23:12:35] <SnowCode> oh,it seems the download have the right size. I'm dumb
[23:12:58] <SnowCode> Well, thanks a lot for the help

[23:13:37] <osse> then codeberg probably still reports the old (and likely current size)
[23:13:55] <osse> but as mentioned it'll get cleaned, it's not relevant for clones, etc etc.
[23:15:16] <SnowCode> oh ok, If codeberg keeps everything, even stuff that are removed it must contain a ton of junk
[23:16:08] <ikke> git has garbage collection which runs every so often

[23:20:49] <ikke> So it will get cleaned up eventually
[23:21:05] <SnowCode> Oh OK
