[04:23:33] <somiaj> unforuntally pinning is kinda a poor way to deal with backports, and can make thigns a pain.
[04:23:44] <Khepra> somiaj: nope, none of that. pure bullseye, never frankendebian'd with the exception that, yes, in the past, pgdg repo was used for postgres.

[04:24:42] <Khepra> it did this once to me. wanted to "upgrade" stable kernel to backported. this should NEVER happen. jell'y suggested that apt might be tracking some internal state somewhere

[04:31:20] <somiaj> If everything you need/want is proivded in the debian stable repo, these issues shouldn't arise, but this isn't always the case, and due to shared libaries can cause apt to not be able to figure out what needs to be done.
[04:31:25] *** Joins: goopsiet (~klmsadosi@191.190.32.76)
[04:32:09] <Khepra> somiaj: you were right on the money. there was a shared manual dep that pulled in libpq from pgdg, and that wasn't purged with the purge of postgres from pgdg
[04:32:45] <godSend23> is this inherent in deb as well as other linux distros and both a strength/hindrance vs. windows?
[04:32:51] <Khepra> unfortunately apt has no facilities to show packages installed from specific sources, so I had to grep through its cache files
[04:33:31] <somiaj> Khepra: apt-patterns can do some of this, and aptitude has a bit better ability
[04:33:34] <somiaj> !not available
[04:33:34] <dpkg> To get a list of packages you have installed now, that are not available from any repository in your sources.list: aptitude search '?narrow(?not(?archive("^[^n][^o].*$")),?version(CURRENT))'
[04:33:45] <somiaj> need aptitude for that though.
[04:33:46] <Khepra> I also hate the fact that apt "remove" doesn't fully remove packages, they're kept in "shadow" state of "rc" .
[04:34:02] <godSend23> so many nuances... oh man
[04:34:23] <Khepra> "rc" are not installed, but kinda are (their configs are). so perhaps I should defautl to always run     apt autoremove --purge     instead of      apt remove
[04:34:41] <somiaj> godSend23: difference is most windows binaries are static linked instead of using shared libs. This has other disavantages though, programs are bigger, and if a security issue is found in a lib, every thing that depends on that lib needs fixed, as opposed to a single lib.
[04:34:45] <godSend23> thus more potential control, but i just want it to be plug-n-play and stable
[04:35:30] <somiaj> so due to static linking, windows binaries do have this same interconnected dependency tree and really only depend on the core windows libs.
[04:35:52] <godSend23> ty for explaining this.. no wonder!

[04:36:22] <Khepra> I don't think "most" windows binares are statically linked.   .dlls are quite often used.   perhaps youmean, they're not shared as each "app" installs its own .dll, even if they're already installed as part of another app
[04:36:29] <somiaj> linux has just choosen to use the shared libs route, and this also effects other distros too. A lot really depends on the software that a user wants.
[04:36:55] <Khepra> linux also can and does experience "dll hell" very often
[04:36:59] <somiaj> Khepra: ahh good point, I guess I think of .dlls as being part of the static linked, but they are bundeled not static linked which is different.

[04:37:53] <godSend23> so if i intend to run strictly Windows Vms for (dental softwares purposes), does deb/manjaro do a good job of compartmentalizing and not run into these issues?

[04:38:34] <Khepra> manjaro is archlinux, btw
[04:39:19] <cedb> what did i walk into?
[04:39:28] <somiaj> as I said if you only use packages from debian's stable repos, you should not run into issues like this.
[04:39:55] <cedb> mandatory manjaro is NOT arch comment
[04:40:11] <Khepra> yeah but that's not always possible.  debian's postgres packages come from pgdg, so it's sort of upstream.
[04:40:20] <godSend23> oh alright somiaj
[04:40:45] <godSend23> oh man cedb
[04:40:46] <somiaj> yea, there are lots of reasons why third party software is needed, as such sometimes you just have to deal with helping apt figure out dependency trees
[04:40:47] <Khepra> the only reason I used pgdg was to force 10 on buster (which installs 11) because I had to replication-migrate from freebsd's 10 many moons ago
[04:41:05] <cedb> godSend23: i dont make the rules
[04:41:14] <Khepra> and then it stuck :)  if it ain't broken, don't fix it, and 10 surely ain't broken.   I just decided to finally migrate to stable's 13 as I moved some servers around.

[06:57:12] <wade> i was hoping someone could point me at a good tutorial or something for getting a mdraid volume r/w from a windows 10 computer
[06:57:29] <Khepra> wade: a what?
[06:57:34] <wade> i seem to have a problem where all the tuts want to make a new shared folder
[06:57:45] <wade> but i don't want to do this, i want to present the entire filesystem of the array on the network
[06:58:01] <wade> and not the system filesystem or disk, does this make any sense?
[06:58:03] <Khepra> you have a mdraid volume on debian, and there's a filesystem on it, and you want that filesystem accessible on your windows machine?  use smb/cifs
[06:58:11] <wade> yes that's what i'm doing
[06:58:21] <Khepra> so, samba
[06:58:31] <wade> but how make samba reference that whole array instead of one folder?
[06:59:04] <Khepra> you can only export directories. directories can be mountpoints of entire filesystems
[06:59:16] <wade> i have not the foggiest notion of how to do that
[06:59:27] <wade> i was able to use samba to move an older linux machine's contents to this newer one
[06:59:34] <wade> but doing the same with windows is giving me fits

[07:00:46] <Khepra> you need to mount that md0 first, and then export that directory via samba
[07:00:58] <wade> it is mounted on the system at boot every time i thought?

[07:04:03] <wade> or if you mean what is md0, it is 5 12tb hdds
[07:04:24] <wade> with about 13TB of crap on it
[07:05:00] <johnjaye> samba is so tricky. apparently there's a v1 and a v2 of it as well
[07:05:03] <Khepra> no, I meant what's _mounted_ on /mnt/md0 . I'm assuming you mounted   /dev/md0    to    /mnt/md0   ?
[07:05:07] <wade> yes i forced version 2 or higher
[07:05:10] <johnjaye> i usually just setup an ftp server to share over the network
[07:05:19] <wade> because v1 is deprecated due to wannaencrypt/cry
[07:05:30] <johnjaye> i'm sure the fabled NFS would be more productive though
[07:05:34] <wade> oh yes i did, Khepra
[07:06:04] <wade> if you have a good tut to make nfs chooch between this md0 and windows 10 that would work too, i'm not beholden to samba is just what i have the most xp with
[07:06:14] <Khepra> wade: see section "Configure a new share"  and below:   https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-set-up-a-samba-server-on-debian-10-buster

[07:10:17] <wade> nvm that time it worked
[07:11:25] <Khepra> the only possible problem here that comes to mind is inability of the samba server to export _mountpoints_ of other filesystems. I don't know if this is or isn't a limitation. Other than that, there's nothing to it really.
[07:12:05] <wade> ok in windows map network drive i put \\192.168.2.2/mnt/md0
[07:12:17] <Khepra> which means you can test this easily by sharing a normal directory. if that works, but a mountpoint doesn't, then yes, that's the limitation

[15:41:50] <rawtaz> Khepra: right, i was however wondering *at what point php wants it*. im not sure what im doing wrong here to not come across in a way that you understand if i may be blunt - im saying that there would presumably be a difference between you running php in such a way that it tries to do something highly privileged, vs if it just prints hello world. it boils down to what it actually does, what code it runs. so when you just say that it "wants" that cap, its still 
[15:42:30] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[15:42:33] <rawtaz> unless you are more specific, one can only *assume* that you are saying that just firing up a basic php binary, regardless of what modules it has compiled into it and/or what extensions it loads, it asks for that cap. which of course is then plain silly.

[15:46:31] <rawtaz> Khepra: yes, but again that does not explain under what circumstances..
[15:46:36] <Khepra> rawtaz: but that's irrelevant, really, because you can't separate profiles as there's no additional executable to transition to. if fpm wants it then the entire PHP applications will be under the cap, which is a big Nope

[15:47:00] <rawtaz> gotcha, thanks!
[15:47:08] <rawtaz> how absurd. have you found any sign as to why it does that?
[15:47:21] <Khepra> rawtaz: I found some sites/posts about fpm apparmor profile and they're all indiscriminately just giving the cap. terrible.
[15:47:27] <rawtaz> Jaami: vlc?
[15:47:40] <rawtaz> Khepra: haha yeah :)
[15:47:52] <rawtaz> Khepra: are you working on using it in a container or just in the system in general?
[15:48:11] <rawtaz> i suppose the php source code should have the cap request inside it somewhere
[15:48:13] <Jaami> i dont like vlc because its too big. :) i guess that is the only best option
[15:48:29] <Khepra> rawtaz: containers are just namespaces. the way I utilize the namespacing power of systemd services comes close to "these are containerized services", but they're not mini-distros in a chroot, no :)
[15:48:42] <rawtaz> ok
[15:48:58] <Khepra> I just use all the namespacing and security options of a service unit, plus the apparmor to plug the holes

[16:02:18] <Khepra> so it seems "apt remove" should almost never be used unless you really know what that does compared to "purge"
[16:02:37] <Khepra> it leaves a lot of cruft, dead symlinks, misplaced files....
[16:03:03] <rawtaz> if you use it first and then purge for the same package, does purge clean up properly?
[16:03:13] <Khepra> especially on major upgrade (eg, from buster to bullseye)
[16:03:33] <rawtaz> my routine is full-upgrade and then reboot and if stuff works autoremove

[16:15:16] <TaZeR> hey guys so i just installed debian 11.2.0 after not using it for a long time, anyway im having difficulty with the basic task of adding myself to sudoers, at first i couldnt even get 'usermod' command to be recognized after using 'su' to get a root console, i had to call it using the full path from /usr/sbin, so i do "./usr/sbin/usermod -aG sudo user" which i dont remember if its supposed to give
[16:15:33] <TaZeR> feedback but it went through i guess, but it doesnt seem to have worked
[16:15:43] <Khepra> !buster su
[16:15:43] <dpkg> Starting with buster, su no longer overrides PATH by default, requiring that you use "su -" or "su -l" for login shells (which is not really a new thing at all...). See https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster#Changes for details.

Be sure to run «aptitude update» after editing sources.list.  Also see <deb-src> <contrib> <non-free> <jessie/updates> <jessie-updates> <mirrors> and "man sources.list".

[21:20:28] <sney> somiaj: nice, information we already had ;)

[21:21:32] <somiaj> ahh I see, this is the factoid I wanted
[21:21:34] <somiaj> !jessie
[21:21:34] <dpkg> Jessie is the codename for Debian 8, released on 2015-04-25. Security support ended 2018-05-17, repos removed from mirrors around 2019-03-24, except for <jessie-lts>. Jessie is the cowgirl in Toy Story 2. See http://wiki.debian.org/DebianJessie and ask me about <install jessie> <jessie release notes> <wheezy->jessie>. Last point release was <8.11>.
[21:21:53] <sney> I suspect old releases are added to archive before they are removed from the main mirrors. not sure how that's scheduled, but I'm not surprised that there would be overlap
[21:21:57] <somiaj> jessie has moved to archive.debian.org, but jessie-lts is on the mirrors, this was a release lts repo was renamed.

[21:36:35] <kee> Are all package versions ever released available somewhere?
[21:36:43] <sney> !snapshot
[21:36:43] <dpkg> https://snapshot.debian.org/ is an archive of almost all Debian packages uploaded since 2005, including those removed from the official archives because they were very buggy, unusable, broken, vulnerable or in some way non-free. https://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100412

[21:38:00] <sney> you may find that snapshot fails sometimes when used as an apt source for more than a handful of packages, just retry a few times and it'll go

[22:08:47] <amacater_> Three suggested steps if it doesn't work.
[22:09:21] <amacater_> 1. Use text only expert install - it simplifies the amount you download

[22:10:18] <somiaj> sceptttre: use deb in both case (not deb-src for lts)

[22:12:48] <somiaj> which mirror is that, maybe not all mirrors have removed it, or the factoid is incorrect.
[22:12:51] <somiaj> !jessie
[22:12:51] <dpkg> Jessie is the codename for Debian 8, released on 2015-04-25. Security support ended 2018-05-17, repos removed from mirrors around 2019-03-24, except for <jessie-lts>. Jessie is the cowgirl in Toy Story 2. See http://wiki.debian.org/DebianJessie and ask me about <install jessie> <jessie release notes> <wheezy->jessie>. Last point release was <8.11>.
[22:12:52] <amacater_> That one asks you to specify the mirror as one of the steps
[22:13:06] <somiaj> says it was removed a few years ago, but you can find it on archive.debian.org
[22:13:28] *** Joins: casmajavi (~casmajavi@user/casmajavi)

[22:13:59] <somiaj> ahh it could be the factoids are out dated, maybe it was removed, but it appears the jessie-lts mirror no longer exists, guess they cleaned this up but we haven't fixed our boths.
[22:14:19] <somiaj> !jessie-lts
[22:14:19] <dpkg> Security support for Debian 8 "Jessie" from the Debian Security Team ended on 2018-05-17.  The amd64, i386, armel and armhf architectures received additional long term support (<LTS>) via <jessie/updates> until June 30, 2020 for a 5 year lifetime total. jessie-lts is no longer supported. Ask me about <jessie->stretch> and <stretch->buster>. See https://wiki.debian.org/LTS for more information
[22:14:23] <amacater_> and in .de
[22:15:02] <somiaj> ahh I see, the factoid lead me astray, seems they decided to fix the way they dealt with jessie-lts.
[22:15:04] <amacater_> What is is with people wanting to install jessie all of a sudden - this is about the third person in three days
[22:15:07] <sceptttre> What about security? I see "deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main" and the equivalent for deb-src
[22:15:10] <somiaj> sceptttre: sorry, seems the facotid was incorrect, that was causing problem.
[22:15:21] <somiaj> !jessie sources.list
[22:15:22] <dpkg> A suitable /etc/apt/sources.list for Debian 8 "Jessie" has two lines: "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ jessie main" "deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main".  Be sure to run «aptitude update» after editing sources.list.  Also see <deb-src> <contrib> <non-free> <jessie/updates> <jessie-updates> <mirrors> and "man sources.list".
[22:15:41] <somiaj> I will assume that is correct, so use that ^^, as the jessie-lts info I got was out dated...someone should clean up that factoid

[22:19:34] <sceptttre> ^^ i'm also curious about it now
[22:19:51] <somiaj> sceptttre: history, when jessie entered into LTS, jessie was moved to archive, and jessie-lts was created with lts updates. During the next release, this was no longer the case, and lts was just added to the main repo, so they retroactivally changed jessie, brough jessie back to the main mirrors, and deleted jessie-lts -- which is where we are at, hence the confusion. The bots factoids show this history
[22:19:57] <somiaj> but are not fully correct.
[22:20:19] <somiaj> at least that is the history as I see it from the info I have avaialble at the moment.

[22:22:18] <dpkg> You can have apt download the <source package> from which a <binary package> was compiled using a "deb-src" line in your <sources.list>. A line like "deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian sid main" does NOT make any binary packages available.

[22:26:38] <sceptttre> Well, while we're here, this is perhaps another history thing from the bot. Why does it show two updates? jessie/updates and jessie-updates?
[22:26:53] <somiaj> because those are different
[22:27:01] <somiaj> one is for security updates, the other is for bug fixes
[22:27:18] <sceptttre> Thank you!
[22:27:22] <somiaj> In bullseye they finally corrected this confusion
[22:27:29] <somiaj> !bullseye/updates
[22:27:30] <dpkg> There is no "bullseye/updates" repository for security updates. To reduce confusion with <bullseye-updates> (which is for other bug fixes), security updates are distributed via the <bullseye-security> repository "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main". Note that you may also need to adjust your Default-Release and pinning settings for apt.
[22:27:59] <sceptttre> That makes more sense... as a newcomer
[22:28:21] <somiaj> though again why are you trying to run jessie?
[22:28:47] <somiaj> you also mentioned desktop, but lts doesn't support destkop, and the browsers in jessie are going to be full of more security holes than swiss cheese
[22:29:37] <sceptttre> I missed to reply your question earlier. Why shouldn't I, really? I've learned more today than if I would've installed the latest and shiniest debian in 20 minutes and go on with my life

[22:30:29] <somiaj> well you can break your system in fun ways if you like to learn, I'm just pointing out that for desktop use, jessie is not supported.
[22:31:01] <sceptttre> What does that mean? Not supported for desktop? I could still install XFCE, could I not?
[22:31:34] <somiaj> it means that you get all the security holes that exist in desktop software (Browsers being the big one, but you will have other security holes)

[22:36:36] <amacater_> sceptttre: If you _really_ have to follow the old version of LFS, you'd be better to install current Bullseye - with current sources - and work from there. You'd also have full security support. LFS will be telling you to set up a chroot and build from source in there. Also, maybe, grab the lstest LFS

[22:37:28] <amacater_> The LTS folks can only support a subset of what was originally in Jessie - as they state - and you have four months from tomorrow. Honestly, start with Debian 11, maybe.
[22:37:42] <amacater_> If you don't want to, then the instructions you are being given here are valid.
[22:37:47] <somiaj> sceptttre: Just be aware of the issues with using a release from 2015.
[22:38:20] <somiaj> and it is now ELTS, which is even more restircted and based on corprate funding, so only very very specific packages some server users need security support for.
[22:39:01] <amacater_> To be honest: I'd be tempted to grab the DVDs and build a VM - ideally isolated from the outside world and do it from there if you really, really want Debian 8
[22:39:28] <sceptttre> amacater_ did I misunderstand part of our convo before? I figured in four months I can just switch to "deb http://archive.debian.org/debian jessie main" and it would work
[22:40:00] <sceptttre> amacater_ thank you. That is really not bad advice but I don't have the hardware lol
[22:40:02] <amacater_> No - in four months it disappears utterly - ELTS is there until 2022-06-30

[22:42:23] <kee> Jessie's probably already got major unpatched vulnerabilities in the software normal people (not sysadmins) use.

[23:00:31] <amacater_> When you run tasksel - it brings up a package selection window which install metapackages.

[23:01:15] <amacater_> Run tasksel as root / via sudo
