[00:34:04] * gilberth modified his client to indicate when a message is likely too long.
[00:35:16] <gilberth> However this only is approximate, as the limit is with the transport and not with the message. And semz says, that my message was cut off a fair bit before those 512 octets. *sigh*
[00:36:32] <semz> should be dependent on name and channel length iirc
[00:36:50] <gilberth> I cannot possibly know how long the IRC message is on the receiving side. No way to tell whether a message is cut off, or not.
[00:42:51] <gilberth> As the receiving side would see ":gilberth!~gilberth@p5b157756.dip0.t-ipconnect.de PRIVMSG #lispcafe :...." And I cannot know that information. It's the IRC network which came up with the "p5b157756.dip0.t-ipconnect.de" part. Hence, even if my IRC message, I send, may fit the 512 bytes, which in this case it did, does not imply that it will make it through without being cut off. I mean I sent "PRIVMSG #lispcafe :blah blah ...".
[00:44:07] <gilberth> That's 71 octets added here. Hmm.
[00:46:18] <gilberth> UTF-8 encoding and font encoding must be considered, too. I hesitate to automatically split messages.
[01:01:00] <sm2n> That sounds horribly broken
[01:01:14] <sm2n> I would guess most clients just overestimate how long the prefix is?
[01:02:05] <gilberth> Perhaps, this is what I do now.

[01:04:16] <gilberth> I mean, this also is about abstractions. The part which provides the user input would need to ask the transport layer for how many octets would be send. With a guessimate on how much will be received by other clients.
[01:51:53] <hayley> Hm, if I decide to SIMD a loop in the DFA, should I expect that the program will take a loop? i.e. would one write abc anticipating at least one b, or would zero be possible? I guess I should anticipate zero or more, if they wrote b

[10:50:01] <sm2n> Actually, going off real life usage
[10:50:06] <sm2n> Booleans are .lock
[10:50:47] <sm2n> Though lockfiles usually contain stuff like a pid
[10:51:03] <sm2n> close enough
[10:51:19] <moon-child> aren't lockfiles more like ... locks?
[10:51:31] <moon-child> I mean, how would you express (say) CONSP as a lockfile?
[10:56:57] <ck_> the filesystem is a tree, with each type-suffixed branch containing their own things. very elegant
[10:56:59] <sm2n> I don't think we're on the same page â€” I meant that they would be booleans since the content of lockfiles tends not to matter (only the filename and possibly timestamp is what matters), which maps neatly to a type inhabited by 2 states
[10:57:23] <sm2n> But at this point we're way off from what is described in that post
[10:57:27] <sm2n> I'm just having fun

[11:04:32] <epony> in reality, you get the ROM variant of the "monitor" disassembler
[11:06:20] <sm2n> monitor disassembler?
[11:06:59] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code_monitor

[11:08:52] <sm2n> oh, essentially a debugger
[11:09:17] <epony> yap
[11:09:36] <epony> kdb/gdb/ddb
[11:12:21] <epony> so.. you get to implement print by addressing the video buffer with register manipulation and passing character generator interrupts
[11:38:48] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Memory_management_software
[11:50:55] <epony> http://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2 for a set of "declarations" what a program would need to be allowed to do with the system calls (which extend the language, are not the languate itself, just OS facilities for interacting with the services)
[11:50:56] -ixelp- pledge(2) - OpenBSD manual pages
[11:51:15] <epony> can be used as a minimal list of syscalls ;-)
[11:52:17] <epony> for kernel tracing http://man.openbsd.org/ktrace.1 (shows you what the program does as requests to the kernel, in a human readable form, quite useful.. too bad a JVM would hide what your programs do)
[11:52:17] -ixelp- ktrace(1) - OpenBSD manual pages
[11:53:06] <epony> you get similar syscalls on other systems (this is just easier to learn)
[11:53:28] <epony> and gets you ramped up on memory allocators
[11:54:37] <epony> there is an equivalent of the dynamic tracer (dtrace) too called btrace http://man.openbsd.org/btrace.8 with a language http://man.openbsd.org/bt.5
[11:54:37] -ixelp- btrace(8) - OpenBSD manual pages
[11:55:17] <epony> that's the "power tools" to know what madness the binary does as "requests and profiling" on the system
[11:55:41] <epony> you'll probably want to do that in Linux anyway due to more features and "conveniences"
[11:57:23] <epony> so, you check what shared libraries (ld) your program needs / calls, then ktrace (strace on Linux) it, then optionally profile it with btrace (dtrace) it, or step through it with gdb / lldb (debuggers for the registers and disassembly)
[11:57:37] <epony> you compile with symbols and you can see which part of the code did that
[11:57:52] <epony> this tooling you can use also on the very same kernel (even when it's live)
[11:59:00] <epony> you can use on any process / program, but if the program is a VM itself, it hides everything as its internal state, so you have to use its own debugging, which is most of the times incomplete tooling or not really what happens on the system
[11:59:39] <epony> in that regard, VMs are "runtimes" for portable prototyping, not real world usage
[11:59:56] <epony> (language / application based VMs that is)
[12:00:22] <epony> OS based VMs are something more complex and rarely bring you joy and happiness on the developer side, just on the consumer side ot things
[12:01:49] <epony> what you really would like are the "containers" (Linux), chroots (UNIX), process groups, "jails" (FreeBSD).. as they are native tools that run at native HW speed and just provide a "name space" of the kernel facilities to isolate processes as "minimal" or "full OS" process groups
[12:02:41] <epony> Lisp implementations compile so.. you get the full tooling of the OS and all goodies, without "JAVA" midlayer
[12:03:58] <epony> both real and virtual machne (guests) can use a serial console to output system messages and be used for debugging the kernel at any time
[12:05:07] <epony> you get full system manuals and standards spec, and a lot of development tools (languages, libraries, toolchains, large and small applications)
[12:05:50] <epony> the system has special changes to increase randomness in memory allocation and implement detection and mitigation of safety breakages
[12:06:07] <epony> http://www.openbsd.org/innovations.html
[12:06:08] -ixelp- OpenBSD: Innovations
[12:07:22] <epony> https://man.openbsd.org/gcc-local.1 and https://man.openbsd.org/clang-local.1 describe the changes in teh compilers and kernel counterparts to make these work for real
[12:07:23] -ixelp- gcc-local(1) - OpenBSD manual pages
[12:07:53] <epony> the system has separate kernel/userland and ports/packages compiler toolchains (independent) and makefile sets
[12:08:23] <epony> it's similar in FreeBSD and NetBSD and Linux to a varying degree (lesser implementations of clean separation)
[12:08:45] <epony> you can totally survive without knowing C ;-)
[12:09:42] <epony> just minimal shell, unix text processing, and your favourite language family lisp,scheme,ecl,abcl,sbcl.. whatever
[12:10:01] <epony> racket,haskel.. long list
[12:11:01] <epony> the system is self hosting and portable on various arches
[12:11:19] <epony> "everything works" for what is included
[12:11:56] <epony> unlike the other security toolkits elsewhere, which give you a varying level of a broken system on pieces and applications, here it's integrated and "fully operational"
[12:12:13] <epony> (also can not be removed / disabled, so you get the security for good)
[12:13:19] <epony> there are daily changes on the system (with improvements and constant work by about 300 devs) for the last 25+ years all the time during that time
[12:13:49] <epony> with full CVS openview / download access 
[12:14:01] <epony> from the web site to the presentations
[12:14:09] <epony> to the original code import
[12:14:36] <epony> http://www.openbsd.org/events.html for some papers and press
[12:14:37] -ixelp- OpenBSD: Events and Papers
[12:15:14] <epony> it's not the fastest system, it's the fastest with the toggled on security mitigations
[12:16:33] <epony> you can totally model your perfect Lisp system around it, or replicating tooling in the Lisp variant
[12:17:11] <epony> the BSD books of McKusick apply for 4.3BSD and 4.4BSD with much improvements
[12:17:52] <epony> http://www.openbsd.org/books.html you want the BSD-specific books (describe the system internals for a quick start)
[12:17:53] -ixelp- OpenBSD: Books
[12:18:05] <epony> are free online on many places
[12:18:48] <epony> the practical getting started guide is here http://www.openbsd.org/faq/
[12:18:48] -ixelp- OpenBSD Frequently Asked Questions
[12:19:35] <epony> the X details are universal and you can use the Archlinux wiki (or Debian/Gentoo whichever you like) for the X details (generic)
[12:20:46] <epony> you have desktop environments Gnome, XFCE, KDE.. etc, but you can also use a light window manager (WM) with lots of choices (the system includes 2 very useful, fvwm and cwm)
[12:21:36] <epony> there are even games and you can develop games on OpenBSD ;-) John Carmack has been doing work like that too in the last couple of years
[12:23:51] <epony> in short: you already have that to reuse.. just step on that base and move to your really fun projects
[12:24:44] <epony> or just reimplement it in Lisp, for proving it can run better and faster (you'll get better optmisations, but the machine specific parts have to be "reused")
[12:27:21] <epony> OpenBSD is still not fully SMP unlocked, FreeBSD runs a lot faster since it's SMP unlocked for the last 12-14 years
[12:27:54] <epony> but you have to learn a lot more, and don't get the "memory" exercises
[12:29:07] <epony> OpenBSD runs better on laptops and hibernates and suspends cleanly since it has independent (own) ACPI implementation, and many of the wireless drivers that other BSDs use come from OpenBSD, along with the OpenSSH and tmux utils and much more
[12:30:03] <epony> just not the consumer / multimedia / fancy very new models, your Lenovo/IBM Thinkapds T and W and X series run fine, probably the R series too
[12:30:16] <epony> and HP probooks and some Dells that are more standard PCs
[12:30:37] <epony> Nvidia is not supported / runs slow / badly / not at all.
[12:31:48] <epony> Internal Intel and Amd graphics and discrete Radeon and Amdgpu cards work fine.. just pick a Radeon if you have a choice for the better quality of the drivers (amdgpu is unstable on Linux/BSD)
[12:32:51] <epony> most NICs work up to 10GbE and even some faster models (but you can't realise the full potential due to SMP contention)
[12:33:04] <epony> 1GbE runs natively
[12:34:05] <epony> has a web and email stack out of the box
[12:35:08] <epony> and lots of packages for the larger portion of dev software ~10-12K packages (built every 2-3 days)
[12:36:08] <epony> you get "daily" system automatic upgrades and all software as packages ready to install immediately from Emacs to LibreOffice and CAD/Maths
[12:37:53] <epony> the system has a very good quality randomness, own audio server/sub-system, and standard POSIX implementation
[12:39:07] <epony> it plays well media files in HD and FHD and QHD resolutions, with GPU acceleration (not yet for the decoding though)
[12:40:17] <epony> the browsers work fine (both) with the freshest (newest) builds, however there is noticeable difference in performance due to double memory shuffling and process management on the side of the browsers (excess load and Linux/Windows specific application model)
[12:41:08] <epony> webshit programming langs are populated too, so you can run your fav CMS software too
[12:42:33] <contrapunctus> I've never needed to block/ignore anyone before I came to this channel...
[12:43:37] <epony> contrapunctus, just enjoy your coffee and skip the above, it's not for you

[17:23:05] <selwyn> iirc zero gravity scenes are usually shot five minutes at a time inside big jets that go into freefall
[17:23:39] <selwyn> going to the iss is impressive
[17:25:51] <MichaelRaskin> Five minutes sounds closer to a suborbital 100km hop
[17:26:16] <ck_> apollo 13 was shot on the vomit comet
[17:26:35] <MichaelRaskin> Rollercoaster-trajectory normal-ish jets are around 30 seconds per segment
[17:26:57] <selwyn> oh ok
[17:27:18] <MichaelRaskin> Spacesuit scenese are sometimes shootable in a pool

[17:56:12] <selwyn> oh ffs
[17:59:13] <Gnuxie> surely you can also just suspend stuff from wires? sounds funny though 
[17:59:49] <selwyn> wires might not look as authentic
[18:00:29] <selwyn> but would an audience be able to tell what zero gravity 'ought to look like'

[18:02:37] <MichaelRaskin> A large part of the audience indeed won't know better whatever weird unphysical things happen. Another large part will know but not care even a little
[18:03:03] * selwyn tries to remember the inception fight scene
[18:03:09] <ck_> .. and Neil deGrasse Tyson will always find something to smugly criticise
[18:03:29] <selwyn> ck_: most recently, santa claus
[18:03:59] <ck_> I was watching one of those iss walkthrough videos by nasa once, the promotional stuff, and I'm a little ashamed to say that the whole thing only really clicked when that astronaut opened a can of peanuts and showed them floating around in it
[18:09:14] <selwyn> interesting to compare the different atheisms approach to space
[18:09:36] <ck_> how many are there?
[18:09:51] <selwyn> the virgin new atheist 'isn't space big and wonderful' vs. the chad soviet 'we went to space and couldn't see god anywhere'
[18:11:48] <ck_> I see. where are you on that spectrum?
[18:12:58] <selwyn> uh
[18:14:24] <selwyn> tbh i find it very hard to take atheism seriously as a coherent world view unless it at least resembles that old school mentality
[18:14:39] <ck_> interesting
[18:15:20] <selwyn> leaving out many other additional criticisms, richard dawkins maintains a church of england aesthetic (if that is the right word to use) as well as traditional prejudices against catholics and muslims
[18:15:23] <selwyn> not a real atheist
[18:16:05] <selwyn> other new atheists i looked into are similarly vacuous at some level
[18:16:32] <dave0> i know god, he's nice :-)
[18:20:27] <selwyn> ~ half an hour until jwst secondary mirror deployment https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive

[18:20:37] <selwyn> perhaps god will make an appearance then

[20:17:01] <sm2n> the difference is that electron bundles v8/blink, whereas this calls into system webview

[22:59:49] <selwyn> good morning gilberth
[23:01:55] <selwyn> for those who are interested, the uk really is an experiment in whether herd immunity is practical in the age of omicron
[23:02:02] <selwyn> tune in in a couple of weeks to see the results
[23:02:47] <lisp123> selwyn: indeed
[23:02:56] <lisp123> long covid be damned
[23:03:21] <gilberth> Oh dear, indeed.
[23:04:33] *** Joins: phantomics (~phantomic@97-118-150-246.hlrn.qwest.net)
[23:04:39] <gilberth> Long Covid is underestimated by a huge margin. It's no fun. What I read about it, is just like my (not Covid related) health condition. No fun at all.
[23:04:43] <selwyn> 7% of the country had it last week
[23:05:29] <lisp123> selwyn: Yikes!
[23:06:33] <lisp123> gilberth: Indeed. For a virus that is so severe that it causes death, it's surprising how blaise everyone is in terms of thinking its a binary outcomne = either die or be 100% okay after 2 weeks
[23:06:34] <selwyn> gilberth: the calculation here is that the death rate remains acceptably low (for the government) at mere hundreds
[23:07:33] <selwyn> so if you don't impose additional restrictions, the only bad consequence for the economy (the most important thing) is staff absences
[23:08:12] <gilberth> Well. You'd need to rest after taking a shower, you need a rest after a few stairs taken, even after simple things like brushing teeth. You can't even take a walk. And for long Covid nobody knows if it is chronic or not.
[23:08:22] <selwyn> the plan might actually work imo but it involves the health service going through hell for at least a few weeks
[23:09:34] <selwyn> which makes me sad
[23:12:37] <gilberth> Yep. What also is underestimated are the collateral damage. Like postponed cancer surgery. This is happening already even without an official collapse of the health system. I am not optimistic for Germany for the next few weeks. Triage already is discussed. And it will happen. I pity everyone needing a hospital.
[23:13:04] <selwyn> i am becoming concerned that i may develop an eye infection that requires a hospital visit
[23:13:37] <gilberth> Ouch! That's sounds bad. I feel sorry for you.
[23:13:55] <selwyn> well
[23:14:00] <selwyn> chances are it won't happen
[23:14:09] <selwyn> but i don't like living in a country where its not a good idea to fall ill
[23:14:30] <contrapunctus> Uh...where's Bike?
[23:14:47] <White_Flame> out bicycling
[23:14:58] <selwyn> bike doesn't usually hang out on this channel
[23:15:03] <contrapunctus> https://jabjab.de:5443/upload/a75f5b15713067434614f6d0c986f536c301cf7e/uxrX6xWGPExpC4eUwFE7BxuPyl971XmCIQbrIgAl/JeGgkKwOSZm5XmaUGZ-5Uw.mp4
[23:15:13] <contrapunctus> That's for Bike.
[23:18:29] <lisp123> selwyn: good luck, hopefully it ends up okay
[23:26:41] <gilberth> In general, I don't get why many people seem to assume that infection rates would be lower here than at our neighbors. We're relatively late, that's all. Makes me angry.

[23:43:11] <selwyn> remember that the uk is removing restrictions rather than tightening them
[23:43:49] <gilberth> I am aware. Spain is doing the same.
[23:43:59] <ck_> while there are restrictions here, it's not very coordinated in my opinion. schools: all open
[23:44:21] <ck_> the charts on https://covid19.who.int/ are quite spikey for the past week
[23:44:22] -ixelp- WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard | WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard With Vaccination Data
[23:44:36] <gilberth> Don't get me started on the schools topic.
[23:46:53] <ck_> I won't -- good night
[23:47:14] <gilberth> Thanks. Take care then!
[23:47:19] <selwyn> goodnight ck
