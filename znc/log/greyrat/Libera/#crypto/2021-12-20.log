[00:19:40] <maroon> dostoyevsky2, that's because they're giving a grace period in case both sides have clocks not perfectly in sync
[00:20:58] <maroon> however that does reduce the already limited security. 999999 is approx 2^20, so accepting the token across 1 30-sec interval is 20 bits of security. But accepting 4 tokens during any 30-sec interval reduces security to 18 bits
[00:22:18] <maroon> you can claw back security by demanding they know the code for the N+1th interval too, if they answer one of the other 3 intervals

[00:36:20] <maroon> if i had to guess, i'd say the token is valid for an odd number of 30 sec intervals, so it's valid for the current interval as well as N intervals on either side

[04:22:03] <rk4> hmm can't easily find the docs about the requirements
[04:22:24] <rk4> but i recall seeing comments like this on submissions fairly commonly: 'Patent Statement: Rijndael or any of its implementations is not and will not be subject to
[04:22:38] <rk4> ...patents.'
[04:25:20] <maroon> some candidates try to have their cake and eat it too - like how RC6 would be free of patents - but only if it had won over rijndael twofish serpent etc
[04:27:02] <rk4> lame :<
[04:27:12] <rk4> <3 serpent
[04:27:46] <maroon> and then RSA waited until just before the patent expired, after milking it for years, and then they release it to the public
[04:29:25] <maroon> i remember years ago seeing writing about how the patent on the IDEA cipher was written to cover any computing device that can perform the IDEA algorithm - which means they claimed to own your pc and mine

[23:11:50] <moose> dostoyevsky2: Alipha: and for disk encryption there are attacks that make either a poor choice
[23:13:55] <moose> I've seen implementations of CBC for disk encryption where they use a random initial value and then add the file start offset on the disk to the IV to calculate the IV for a given file. That's vulnerable to watermarking attacks.
[23:14:36] <moose> Really CBC is a bad idea in general, I don't know of a good way to do it for disk encryption.
[23:15:31] <dostoyevsky2> moose: I saw CBC being used with the sector number as the iv the other day on OpenBSD -- but it was for vnd which I think is not being used anymore... but the code is still there...
[23:15:39] <moose> Yes, terrible haha
[23:16:43] <Alipha> dostoyevsky2: the MAC (message authentication code) provides integrity, not the IV/nonce. but again, while the MAC is a part of the GCM algorithm, it's still an additional 16 bytes that's attached to the message. (and the IV/nonce is another additional 16 bytes)
[23:16:48] <moose> I'd prefer XTS for disk encryption over GCM too.
[23:17:30] <Alipha> Adiantum!
[23:17:32] <dostoyevsky2> In any case, I don't see that gocryptfs would separate the iv from the encrypted message for GCM.  It's not sector-based, it's file-based, so the additional bytes are not a pain point. 
[23:18:04] <ericonr> ZFS uses  aes-gcm, interestingly enough
[23:18:12] <ericonr> or well, supports it
[23:18:33] <moose> I'd also be wary of file based encryption and ensure the implementation is monitoring the amount of encrypted data to properly rotate keys before too many blocks are enciphered under one key.
[23:18:45] <moose> Especially if it's for a full file system.

[23:23:49] <Alipha> moose: because AES-128 is significantly faster?
[23:24:39] <moose> Alipha: And is more secure and is less likely to result in block collisions over the key input space.

[23:27:27] <dostoyevsky2> I don't really like gocryptfs code... it's so confusing to read.  And then writing a class like this that implements like 10 different encryption schemes in one file?  https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/blob/master/internal/cryptocore/cryptocore.go
[23:27:42] <moose> And as far as block collisions, it's simple math. The block size is still 128 bits in all key sizes. More keys and the same block size equals more collision potential, which is particularly dangerous for disk encryption. And because people erroneously say that AES-256 has "256 bit security margin", a lot of implementations don't even rotate keys with data size because 2^128 blocks is huge :)
[23:28:25] <moose> But you'll notice that any implementation using AES-128 that is reviewed will re-key at 2^32 blocks or sooner sometimes.
[23:29:38] <moose> AES-128 is always recommended above AES-256 right now due to actual published attacks. The only folks recommending AES-256 are marketing people I think.

[23:31:25] <Alipha> that 2^119 is against the full 14 rounds? and is a related key attack?
[23:31:53] <maroon> if rekeying at 2^32 blocks, that means they think AES is vulnerable to SWEET32? :)

[23:38:38] *** Joins: machinedgod (~machinedg@24.105.81.50)
[23:40:47] <moose> yawkat: Basically AES-256 doesn't provide good enough key expansion for it to matter at all, except for small messages. When you're doing disk encryption, you are pushing the limits of these algorithms with respect to their output domain size. This increases the possibility of seeing collisions under a single key.
[23:40:59] <moose> So even if you have a 256-bit key, you're still going to re-key at 2^32 or fewer blocks.
[23:42:27] <moose> And with the attacks on AES-256 due to the low quality KSA, there is a specific class of attacks that relies on local collisions that reduces the security to 2^119 as I mentioned.
[23:43:31] <moose> What's more, is that you can optimize those attacks and perform a variety of other attacks if you observe a full block collision.
[23:43:40] <moose> So yeah, AES-128 is just safer.
[23:44:30] <Alipha> except against quantum computers ;-)
[23:44:57] <moose> AES-256 will be reduced to the same level of security as AES-128 because of the 128 bit block size.

[23:47:19] <moose> Remember it's not about doing things faster in the terms of raw computing, it's about sorting quickly. And in this case you'll be searching the output space to invert the function.
[23:49:05] <moose> QC will be super neat
[23:50:21] <yawkat> What? How are the block sizes relevant for grovers algorithm? The key space is your search space
[23:53:08] <MacGyver> Also I'm *pretty* sure that the current best class of attacks on AES-256 reduces the complexity to 2^254.4
[23:53:20] <MacGyver> Unless something amazing happened in the past four years that I completely missed.
[23:54:09] <MacGyver> So sure, it's cryptographically broken in the sense that there exists *an* attack that does it better than bruteforce, but I'd like to see the citation for the claim that it becomes *worse than AES-128*.
[23:57:07] <dostoyevsky2> https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/blob/master/module/icp/algs/modes/gcm.c#L1208 <- for zfs they just seem to increas a counter for the nonce which is ok to do... Encryption code seems well-sorted to my eyes, nice to read :)
[23:57:08] <Alipha> it's only worse than AES-128 if you use related keys
[23:57:42] <MacGyver> Oh that bullshit again.
[23:57:47] <yawkat> Which is not all that surprising, since it uses more key bits to fill the same key schedule
[23:57:52] <MacGyver> At least it's not a reduced-round attack?
[23:58:00] <yawkat> Well fill the same round keys. 
[23:58:06] <Alipha> dostoyevsky2: incrementing nonce is okay for GCM, yes. TYPICALLY, if someone uses the word "nonce", it just has to be unique. if someone uses the word "IV", then it probably has to be random
