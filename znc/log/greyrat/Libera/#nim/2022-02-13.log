[02:42:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I was using nimterface but rika suggested traitor and i liked it
[02:42:41] <madprops> why does it make sense?
[02:42:55] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> cause it's a `trait` like system
[02:43:11] <madprops> ahhh
[02:43:20] <madprops> clever
[02:44:47] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It has two parts it has the ensuring all types that implement a concept implements all the procedures and it also has the dynamic dispatch using a vtable like thijng
[02:44:50] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> thing even
[02:46:51] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> The only issue i have right now is trying to create the converters for a given type, there are a lot of permuations so i'm thinking about making a `x.implConv(BoundObject, DuckObject)` which emits all the permutations of that type so `Bound` `Duck` Bound, Duck\`
[02:47:21] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Again i fucked up permutation for combination i think

[04:09:48] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> The converter is required for this example to make sense

[10:06:21] <FromDiscord> <JSONBash> This might be a bit over my head for now...

[18:09:28] <PMunch> @Waldecir_Santos, macros can be a bit odd if you aren't used to them. What are you actually trying to do, and how are you calling your macro?

[18:11:16] <PMunch> (Note that macros can take types, but that is the type they will have on runtime, if you want an argument of that type during compile-time you need to use `static`. Ie. `macro test(arg: string)`, `arg` will still be a NimNode, but it is a NimNode that will somehow hold a string when it is compiled. If you do `macro test(arg: static[string])` then it is an actual string type in the body of `test`.
[18:12:06] <FromDiscord> <Waldecir Santos> Yeap I got the static thing.

[18:58:09] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @Waldecir Santos "What is nimskull 🤔": nim fork
[19:00:14] <PMunch> I mean my idea was to simply remove json and latex generation, then rewrite every part of the HTML output to JSON output. While doing that I would write a program which converted the JSON back into HTML, and make sure that `nim doc` would call that program with all arguments related to documentation generation
[19:00:23] <FromDiscord> <Waldecir Santos> Sure I'm just not sure what is is trying to solve, and why is it in a fork and not in the main
[19:01:02] <PMunch> It's made by a loose collective of contributors who didn't like how Nim was managed, especially in regards to contributions and planning
[19:01:54] <PMunch> They wanted to do things differently, so they forked Nim as NimSkull and do their own thing there. Haven't really looked into how much they've actually gotten done since the fork though
[19:02:04] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> that would be a N+20th iteration of the same rant, so for the sake of keeping it short - PMunch is mostly correct
[19:02:43] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Mostly because we care about things that are completely neglected  in the mainline
[19:03:25] <FromDiscord> <Waldecir Santos> Got it, no worries, just trying to understand the ecosystem
[19:03:56] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Such as quality error messages (aka "I give up and accept I'm the only one left who doesn't like clang's / Rust's / Elm's error messages."), refactoring the decade-old pile of garbage, thinking ahead about tooling UX, having actual spec and so on.
[19:06:01] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @PMunch "I mean my idea": that might be easier to implement, although I'm not sure if that is what will be beneficial for the long-term improvements. Maybe I just don't really like use of json as an IR format for this. If things are kept in types you can serialize them in different ways, but with json you are mostly going to do tree trasnforms

[20:06:54] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> thank you sir
[20:07:20] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> what is the choice for nim to not support unicode by default? I understand it's quite hard to get right, but there are languages  that do it right
[20:07:56] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> or maybe the strings are utf-8, but iterating over the characters returns bytes and not codepoints?
[20:07:59] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> nim supports unicode
[20:08:13] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> just string is an array of utf-8 bytes
[20:08:21] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> oh that makes sense
[20:08:24] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> and `rune` is a codepoint?

[21:36:24] <Amun-Ra> endians still fails to build on js target in 1.6.4 
[21:36:59] <anddam> I canno make sense of https://github.com/nimgl/nimgl the install instructions are just "nimble install nimgl"
[21:37:13] <anddam> yet I cannot use any of the examples I tried with "nim c -r somexample.nim"
[21:37:45] <Amun-Ra> do you have nimble and nimgl installed?
[21:38:04] <anddam> I do
[21:38:21] <Amun-Ra> what's the error?
[21:38:22] <anddam> I just updated nim to 1.6.4, cleaned all nimble packages, installed nimgl with "nimble install nimgl"
[21:38:52] <anddam> also I cloned nimgl/nimgl , updated its submodules for good measure and moved into examples/

[21:40:52] <anddam> this I stumbled on already and Yardanico_ helped building cimgui lib
[21:41:20] <anddam> but what I gather from then was that I needed to do that because I was trying to use nimgl/imgui repo, that was not packaged for nimble
[21:41:51] <anddam> now I am installing a nimble package, I somehow expected things to work, or at least to tell me "you need to install this and this other library as well" someplace
[21:53:14] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> In reply to @b4mbus "what would be the": ok I got it with `string.reversed().insertSep(' ', 2)`
[21:56:43] <FromDiscord> <rishav> For options, is it possible to pack something in the none return? I want both the success and failure states to pass some extra information.↵For example, i really want to return something like `none(42)` instead of `none(int)`.↵Anyway to achieve this?
[21:57:37] <Amun-Ra> nope, none is none
[21:58:24] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> How about to return tuple? like `return (none, 42)`
[21:58:37] <Amun-Ra> looks like you need a tagged union or sth

[22:12:32] <FromDiscord> <Waldecir Santos> @haxscramper the matched variable is passed by ref if not how should I do it ?  I'm matching identdefs looping and changing some values but it get lost after I leave the if matches context
[22:14:05] *** Joins: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon)
[22:14:39] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> there is no "pass by ref" in nim, there is a `ref` type, it is different from C++ `&` ref. And match branch creates a number of `var matchedName` placeholders that get assigned to it
[22:15:13] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `if matches()`'s scope is created by `if`, so all variables injected by `matches` are available only in `if` scope
[22:15:34] <FromDiscord> <Waldecir Santos> This is what I did, basically "replaces" a Ident Node with a PragmaExpr:
