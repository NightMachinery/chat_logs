[18:08:16] <ychaouche> hey email gurus
[18:08:17] *** Joins: ServerStatsDisco (~serversta@2001:470:69fc:105::1a)
[18:09:55] <ychaouche> I am looking at DSN codes and wondering about the seemingly arbitrary class numbers 2,4,5, instead of 1,2,3 for e.g
[18:10:33] <ychaouche> so we have 2.x.x, 4.x.x and 5.x.x defined, but not 1.x.x nor 3.x.x
[18:12:58] <ychaouche> or am I missing an RFC update possibly ? this article says there are codes for class 1 and 3 : https://www.lifewire.com/smtp-error-messages-1166422
[18:17:26] *** Quits: tex (~super@user/dix) (Remote host closed the connection)

[18:38:15] <lunaphyte> ychaouche: have you read up on smtp reply codes
[18:38:16] <lunaphyte> ?
[18:40:41] <lunaphyte> the enhanced status codes [e.g. dsn codes] complement/extend [e.g. enhance] the basic smtp reply codes
[18:48:16] <ychaouche> lunaphyte: this ? https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3463
[18:48:40] <lunaphyte> those are the enhanced codes.  not the basic codes
[18:48:41] <ychaouche> it is titled enhaced mail system status codes
[18:49:00] <ychaouche> yes, still no 1.x.x and 3.x.x codes there
[18:49:25] <ychaouche> class = "2"/"4"/"5"
[18:50:25] <lunaphyte> rfc 5321 is probably where you'll want to look for discussion of the basic smtp codes
[18:50:34] <ychaouche> but again, I might be looking at the wrong RFC... ah
[18:55:43] <ychaouche> no mention of class 1 and 3 there too
[18:55:52] * ychaouche shrugs
[19:00:48] <lunaphyte> i'm not sure what you're confused about
[19:01:33] <lunaphyte> the basic codes are 2,3,4,5
[19:03:26] <lunaphyte> the enhanced status codes generally extend completion related states, which correlate to the basic codes 2,4,5
[19:03:47] <lunaphyte> ergo, the enhanced status codes use classes 2,4,5
[19:04:55] <ychaouche> Can't see classes 1 and 3 in the RFCs, but see them referenced here https://www.lifewire.com/smtp-error-messages-1166422
[19:05:04] <ychaouche> so I wonder in which RFC will I find the definition of class 1 and 3
[19:05:19] <lunaphyte> who said there were classes 1 and 3?  no one here
[19:05:37] <ychaouche> also here : https://wiki.mattrude.com/SMTP_Status_Codes
[19:05:50] <ychaouche> [16:31] <lunaphyte> the basic codes are 2,3,4,5
[19:05:57] <ychaouche> unless code and class are different ?
[19:06:52] <ychaouche> or maybe DSN code and SMTP code are different
[19:07:09] <ychaouche> I might be confusing two things
[19:08:27] <lunaphyte> first, there were the response status codes.  then, a new set of codes were introduced, and were termed "enhanced status codes".
[19:09:14] <lunaphyte> as part of the itroducing and naming of enhanced status codes, the "original" response status codes were "renamed" to "basic status codes
[19:09:19] <lunaphyte> *introducing
[19:11:44] <lunaphyte> they remain two distinct, different, independent, sets of codes, but naturally, are tightly coupled to one another
[19:27:28] <styx> abc x.y.z -> abc is RFC5321, x.y.z seem to be in rfc5248 . 1xx does not exist there, however.
