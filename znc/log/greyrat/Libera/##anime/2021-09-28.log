[00:56:26] <psyomn> so what are you guys watching currently? Finished thunderbolt fantasy lately, and enjoyed it more than I was expecting. 
[01:00:44] *** Quits: zoidberg (uid349353@user/saganman) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:00:52] <senti> psyomn: past few days, I've actually not been watching much, but I remember I finished Peach Boy Riverside last week
[01:01:17] <senti> they really did it weird with the episode ordering
[01:01:41] <senti> other than that, I liked it
[01:02:11] <senti> psyomn: You ever watched Knightfall?
[01:02:16] <senti> I saw the first season.
[01:02:31] <psyomn> nopers
[01:02:33] <psyomn> let me check it
[01:02:49] <senti> ah, give it a look, it ain't the best, but it ain't bad imo
[01:02:53] <senti> it's a little slow
[01:03:05] <senti> if you're bored it's a show to watch
[01:03:33] <senti> I say it's ok, you might hate it or like it, we're different people
[01:04:00] <Miyukii> I was planning to watch thunderbolt fantasy. Does it have a good story or is it mostly the fighting scenes?
[01:04:10] <senti> the templars, everytime I see a templar, I think of Assassin's Creed
[01:04:23] <psyomn> senti: thanks will do! is it on MAL? I'd like to check out the premise 
[01:04:44] <psyomn> Miyukii: I really enjoyed the characters. The story is good, but the characters made it for me.
[01:04:44] <senti> no, it's not an anime, an hbo style tv series
[01:04:51] <psyomn> right, was confused there for a second :P 
[01:05:04] <senti> ha ha ha, I don't explain well, sorry mate
[01:05:28] <senti> yeah, I like the story though, it's not bad
[01:05:40] <psyomn> and what I liked about it was that the artstyle really reminded me of very old final fantasy box art (yoshimata amano)
[01:05:47] <psyomn> all good :D 
[01:06:22] <senti> psyomn: ohhh, it's that style. I haven't seen the show. I gotta give it a try!
[01:06:49] <senti> how many seasons is it?
[01:07:24] <psyomn> ~4 iirc; but they finished too quick for me :P

[09:22:17] <MootPoot> does any VR look good
[09:22:25] <MootPoot> its all like playing a ps2 game
[09:22:25] <ButterNoodle> man.......
[09:22:30] <DaPinkOne> most of these reviews on steam have sub 3hour play time. it's a 25$ game
[09:22:36] <ButterNoodle> vr kanojo is kinda ok
[09:22:39] <senti> she was hot, but I donno
[09:22:40] <MootPoot> oh yeah
[09:22:45] <MootPoot> vr kanojo is one 
[09:22:48] <senti> that fox tail
[09:22:49] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, I really enjoyed this one shooting game, where the robots are coming for ya
[09:22:53] <DaPinkOne> and beat saber, of course
[09:22:55] <senti> felt more like it was my sister
[09:23:05] <ButterNoodle> how old senti 
[09:23:05] <MootPoot> rtx 5080 is needed before we can have good VR gfx
[09:23:23] <ButterNoodle> idk if thats the problem
[09:23:25] <senti> I don't have a sister bro, that makes it even weirder
[09:23:26] <DaPinkOne> vr kanojo seems cringy as fuck
[09:24:05] <ButterNoodle> I mean its not made for family game night
[09:24:16] <ButterNoodle> together vr is good
[09:24:40] <MootPoot> you say cringy but here you are in ##anime DaPinkOne 
[09:24:55] <DaPinkOne> there was that ghost hunter game that was pretty good in VR
[09:24:56] <ButterNoodle> he plays overwatch too
[09:25:11] <ButterNoodle> its been a while DaPinkOne..
[09:25:13] <MootPoot> overwatch is good for the R34
[09:25:14] <DaPinkOne> phantasmagoria
[09:25:24] <ButterNoodle> that sounds sexual
[09:25:35] <ButterNoodle> *I cum in ghosts
[09:25:41] <DaPinkOne> it's actually not at all
[09:25:48] <ButterNoodle> ik
[09:26:19] <MootPoot> at some point we should stop actually talking in IRC and just spam "sex" and "cum" nonstop
[09:26:34] <DaPinkOne> i played it a bit on PC, and a bit on VR. for sure better in VR. PC support seems to have been an afterthought
[09:26:40] <amigojapan> No please MootPoot 
[09:26:59] <MootPoot> lol amigojapan 
[09:26:59] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, some people do actually have other things to think about
[09:27:15] <MootPoot> sex, cum, anime, computer, food
[09:27:16] <MootPoot> there
[09:27:38] <amigojapan> I am ok with food porn
[09:28:08] <MootPoot> lol I guess that means you like nyotaimori

[09:30:08] <MootPoot> looks like consumerism
[09:30:39] <amigojapan> MootPoot: we need to eat
[09:31:03] <amigojapan> MootPoot: nessesity is not consumerism
[09:31:05] <MootPoot> not from branded consumerist companies
[09:31:36] <MootPoot> which harm and factory farm to deliver you garbage for cheap and destory the environment
[09:31:37] <DaPinkOne> we need to feed. we don't necessarily need specific foods, or foods as processed/marketed
[09:31:54] <MootPoot> food is planned obsolesence 
[09:31:58] <MootPoot> it has a expiry date
[09:31:59] <DaPinkOne> but I do love me some food
[09:32:19] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, that's not generally what planned obsolescence means
[09:32:36] <MootPoot> dosen't matter
[09:32:48] <MootPoot> it has a planned date that its useless after
[09:32:54] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: I wish food grew on trees, wait it does :)
[09:32:57] <DaPinkOne> the expiration of food isn't the issue. it's overproduction and hoarding for profit
[09:33:04] <MootPoot> lol
[09:33:06] <DaPinkOne> while people go hungry
[09:33:08] <MootPoot> I was joking
[09:33:14] <MootPoot> I was poking fun at amigo
[09:33:27] <DaPinkOne> MootPoot, ah, I was being serious.
[09:34:10] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: recently I was complaining about planned obsolescence
[09:34:35] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, it's a bit annoying, yes
[09:34:53] <DaPinkOne> right-to-repair, and modular designs could help quite a bit.
[09:35:03] <amigojapan> Yup
[09:35:51] <MootPoot> I am for right to repair for food
[09:35:59] <MootPoot> food should not be thrown away after expiry
[09:36:02] <DaPinkOne> them's bad for profits though, so it won't happen here.
[09:36:05] <MootPoot> it should be eaten 
[09:36:12] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: also changing the objective of things like "let's have the lightest phone possible"and making it impossible to change the battery
[09:36:14] <MootPoot> after you fix the rotten part
[09:36:30] <MootPoot> amigojapan: tbh the lightest/slimmest phone fad is all over now
[09:36:40] <MootPoot> mostly marketing is about looks and camera now
[09:36:43] <MootPoot> and performance
[09:37:34] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, I used to have a phone that was around half the size of my current. tiny phones fell out of favor 'cause it's just too hard to fit parts in there
[09:37:43] <DaPinkOne> tiny phone has shitty performance
[09:38:03] <MootPoot> cum
[09:38:04] <DaPinkOne> and tiny screen
[09:38:36] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: I am for huge phones with chargeable battery and screen
[09:39:14] <senti> I have 2 small screens and a 32 inch screen at my computer desk
[09:39:20] <MootPoot> hug e dick
[09:39:35] <MootPoot> I run triple 27 inch 4k monitors
[09:39:37] <senti> MootPoot: leave butter alone
[09:40:06] <senti> MootPoot: you're consistent, I wish I was
[09:40:30] <senti> I guess I'm consistently drunk, but other than that
[09:40:36] <MootPoot> well, the monitors are 2 different models
[09:40:43] <senti> but they're 27
[09:40:48] <MootPoot> 2 are asus MG28UQs
[09:41:00] <MootPoot> and one is a LG27 GN 950
[09:41:24] <senti> nice!
[09:41:28] <senti> you got good shit
[09:41:48] <MootPoot> it was a royal PITA to get the LG
[09:41:49] <MootPoot> but worth
[09:42:10] <senti> MootPoot you are a royal good friend
[09:42:35] <senti> sorry, too excited
[09:42:37] <MootPoot> my blood is not royal
[09:42:40] <senti> few too many drinks
[09:42:55] <senti> ah, fair enough mate
[09:42:58] * MootPoot pours senti a shot of his joker energy drink
[09:43:03] <senti> I'm not royal either
[09:43:14] * senti bounces off the walls
[09:43:31] * senti exclaims "too much energy!"
[09:43:45] <senti> ok I'm back
[09:44:06] <senti> MootPoot: seriously though, an energy drink would probably kill me
[09:44:39] <senti> I'm super sensitive to caffeine and sugar
[09:48:40] <MootPoot> energy drinks are pretty mild though
[09:48:45] <MootPoot> compared to an actual cup of joe
[09:49:00] <senti> I can't even handle that
[09:49:13] <senti> I handle alcohol damn well though (so to speak)
[09:49:15] <MootPoot> can you handle the caffiene in a pop
[09:49:34] <senti> soda is too much, so no
[09:49:53] <MootPoot> diet soda?
[09:50:02] <senti> well, I can take a soda, just have to be sober first
[09:50:11] <MootPoot> damn
[09:50:14] <senti> kinda hard ask about being sober
[09:50:15] <MootPoot> that sounds like you have like
[09:50:20] <MootPoot> a clinical level of sensitivity
[09:50:37] <senti> I don't doubt it
[09:51:09] <senti> also, how did that weed almost kill me the other day? guess I'm getting weak in my old age
[09:51:50] <MootPoot> I've never done any drugs
[09:51:57] <MootPoot> aside from caffiene
[09:52:11] <MootPoot> and meth
[09:52:18] <amigojapan> senti: I warned you about weed
[09:52:22] <MootPoot> I take a hit of meth daily
[09:52:23] <senti> aside from the caffeine, good that you haven't. Don't start trying that stuff, mate
[09:52:37] <senti> you right, amigo, you right
[09:52:43] <MootPoot> I say meth but its just what my doc gives me for adhd
[09:52:46] <senti> I didn't listen
[09:52:52] <MootPoot> Methylphenid HCL
[09:52:54] <senti> I got burned
[09:53:08] <MootPoot> idk if thats related to the drug drug meth
[09:53:39] <senti> eh, no worries mate, we ain't touching that
[09:54:58] <MootPoot> but anyway
[09:55:12] <MootPoot> my mind gets scattered and I lose all direction/energy
[09:55:14] <MootPoot> if I dont take it
[09:55:16] <MootPoot> but if I do take it
[09:55:30] <MootPoot> I can't tell if I'm hungry or thirsty
[09:55:40] <MootPoot> so I'll go like 16hrs+ without eating and not even know
[09:55:45] <MootPoot> just have a headache
[09:55:55] <MootPoot> until I realize I haven't eaten all day
[09:56:32] <senti> I don't eat when I drink. I've gone 7 days, no food
[09:56:48] <senti> well, I eat sometimes when I drink, but a lot of time, no
[09:56:49] <MootPoot> damn
[09:56:56] <MootPoot> longest I've gone is like
[09:56:58] <MootPoot> 3.5 days
[09:57:13] <MootPoot> at that point its not hunger, just headache
[09:57:15] <senti> ah, that's good that you don't go so long man
[09:57:21] <senti> it sucks recovering
[09:57:26] <MootPoot> well its a little different
[09:57:31] <senti> I barely can eat, coming back
[09:57:34] <MootPoot> you still get calories from alcohol right
[09:57:38] <MootPoot> some calories
[09:57:50] <senti> yeah
[09:57:59] <senti> but it's shit calories 
[09:58:13] <MootPoot> the 3.5 days I did or extended no eating I did is with no calories at all
[09:58:18] <MootPoot> no liquid either
[09:58:34] <MootPoot> it was shit
[09:58:48] <MootPoot> my family found out why I was being so pissy 
[09:58:50] <senti> I should probably eat now, but I can't stand the thought of it
[09:58:51] <MootPoot> then they force fed me
[09:59:20] <senti> they forced you?
[09:59:39] <MootPoot> they grabbed me
[09:59:44] <MootPoot> and then forced me to eat
[09:59:49] <MootPoot> well it worked after the first bite
[09:59:51] <senti> damn dude!
[09:59:55] <MootPoot> then I ate normally
[10:00:05] <MootPoot> I just had my hunger switch broken 
[10:00:15] <senti> maybe I need to be forced
[10:00:19] <senti> hmmmm
[10:00:20] <MootPoot> ecchi
[10:00:29] <senti> you know what, maybe I should make some food
[10:00:38] <MootPoot> onee-san forcing her baguttee down your throat
[10:00:41] <MootPoot> pervy
[10:00:43] <senti> it's so hard to get up though
[10:00:56] <senti> I can't leave my chair, I'm sorry
[10:01:24] <senti> that's an excuse. Ok, I can leave the chair now
[10:01:30] <senti> I am the man, I got this

[15:10:15] <Macer> peach boy was too
[15:10:43] <Macer> although. as far as isekai goes.. i like arifuerta .. i think they are having another season this season
[15:10:49] <Macer> so that will be nice to watch
[15:11:41] <amigojapan> Macer: I changed my mind recently and noticed that not all isekai are bad, but most are, but there are hidden gems
[15:12:15] <Macer> yah
[15:12:24] <Macer> it's just an easy way to develop a quick plot

[15:17:55] <Macer> megumin is a close 2nd tho
[15:18:10] <amigojapan> I see

[15:18:47] <Macer> i mean cmon.. that one where she is practicing her explosion magic on that castle over and over and over was hilarious :)

[16:13:42] <amigojapan> True tsukkin 
[16:14:23] <tsukkin> i think the main difference is whether they actually focus on worldbuilding vs wish fulfillment

[16:14:55] <tsukkin> okay but most of the really shitty isekai never actually make their main character hurt in any way
[16:15:28] <amigojapan> tsukkin: I am kind of glad we are moving away from the school anime formula. And having older characters. But it is become just another set formula
[16:15:49] <tsukkin> no i think the school anime are still plentiful
[16:16:50] <amigojapan> tsukkin: they did find clever ways to cram interesting stories into the school anime mold
[16:17:16] <tsukkin> i count at least 4 highschool anime for fall season 2021
[16:17:52] <amigojapan> I see. But before it was almost 100 percent
[16:18:26] <tsukkin> yeah more anime in general is getting made
[16:18:47] <amigojapan> Right
[16:19:03] <tsukkin> there are still new sports anime even
[16:19:13] <tsukkin> this season we have all girls ice hockey
[16:21:15] <tsukkin> and apparently an anime adaptation of nintendo switch boxing

[16:25:08] <tsukkin> amigojapan for some it works
[16:25:19] <amigojapan> Yes
[16:25:22] <tsukkin> not all isekai need to be isekai i agree
[16:26:02] <tsukkin> and honestly mushoku tensei and bookworm do isekai the best by making their characters actually born into the new world
[16:26:07] <JesseDesu> is irc considered social media?
[16:26:18] <tsukkin> thus making the main character actually like , care about the people around them
[16:26:24] <tsukkin> and invested in the society
[16:26:57] <tsukkin> jessedesu social media is where you go to develop your personal brand 
[16:26:57] <amigojapan> tsukkin: is mahoutsukai no yome just fantasy or is it isekai?
[16:27:17] <JesseDesu> thats a very specific definition of social media
[16:27:27] <tsukkin> ummn not familiar one sec
[16:27:47] <tsukkin> you could argue either way
[16:28:17] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: I think it is
[16:28:18] <tsukkin> technically speaking she never ' leaves ' earth but it may as well be isekai anyway
[16:28:53] <tsukkin> but she also has zero ties to human civilization if i remember correctly so in that sense it may as well not be isekai
[16:28:54] <amigojapan> tsukkin: I see
[16:29:04] <JesseDesu> i wonder if irc is being scraped for personal data
[16:29:18] <tsukkin> jessedesu it can be by literally anyone

[16:31:38] <JesseDesu> what if big data is watching
[16:32:06] <tsukkin> i would hardly put it past corporations to do weird sneaky things like search your computer for log files as well

[17:36:53] <Omega037> It has actually gotten somewhat smaller as it has gotten more popular
[17:37:05] <Omega037> Like the cliche becomes the norm and everyone just works around that

[17:38:01] <tsukkin> it happens in real life too
[17:39:05] <Omega037> Regression to the mean is common, sure

[17:40:54] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: she ends up going home
[17:40:56] <Omega037> In English it is called Portal Fantasy

[17:41:14] <Omega037> Wizard of Oz

[17:41:24] <tsukkin> when you  consider the target demographics of shounen anime and manga it makes total sense for most isekai to be ' video gamey '

[17:43:51] <DunceCotus> though sometimes we get it right

[17:46:25] <DunceCotus> I understand the Beatles craze tho, Yellow Submarine is still one of the trippiest things i've seen
[17:46:46] <Omega037> They censored the bottom half of his body from TV because he shook his hips

[17:48:41] <Omega037> DunceCotus, jail back then was pretty rough
[17:48:42] <DunceCotus> but that doesn't mean they're so much better now
[17:48:57] <DunceCotus> apparently there's more slavery in the world now than ever in history... Fact
[17:49:10] <Omega037> Wasn't saying they were, was sorta saying that things which seem amazing at the time become mundane later
[17:49:18] <Omega037> DunceCotus, not chattel slavery
[17:49:24] <DunceCotus> no, its worse
[17:49:26] <Omega037> And not institutionalized the same way
[17:49:29] <Omega037> No, it isn't worse
[17:49:44] <DunceCotus> okay maybe not worse
[17:49:47] <DunceCotus> but not much better
[17:49:53] <Omega037> Chattel slavery, where slaves are literally not human and just property, is MUCH worse
[17:50:12] <DunceCotus> they were probably taken better care of
[17:50:14] <Omega037> And there was a large empire in the open seas made of the slave trade
[17:50:23] <Omega037> DunceCotus, not remotely
[17:50:29] <Omega037> It was pretty horrific
[17:50:36] <DunceCotus> i've heard the stories
[17:50:38] <amigojapan> Omega037: DunceCotus is saying "people are slaves to their jobs in capitalism
[17:50:43] <DunceCotus> but keep in mind history is written by the victors
[17:50:53] <DunceCotus> they want to paint time before capitalism as utterly barbaric
[17:50:54] <Omega037> amigojapan, I assume he means like slaves in Qatar
[17:51:00] <tsukkin> i generally just prefer newer stuff because of better animation technology
[17:51:08] <Omega037> Legit slaves, but more like slavery in the middle east
[17:51:10] <tsukkin> i like watching older things on occasion
[17:51:10] <amigojapan> No Omega037 
[17:51:19] <Omega037> Not the shit done in Southern US or Haiti
[17:51:23] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: no I mean literal slaves
[17:51:32] <Omega037> Totally different level
[17:51:34] <DunceCotus> but sure wage slavery is crap too
[17:51:35] <amigojapan> Ah ok DunceCotus 
[17:51:47] <Omega037> They had 100% right to rape, torture, and kill you
[17:51:54] <Omega037> Would breed you with other slaves and sell your kids
[17:52:04] <Omega037> This wasn't extreme cases, this was the norm
[17:52:11] <DunceCotus> Omega037: where are you getting that info from tho
[17:52:13] <Omega037> Complete removal of personhood and rights
[17:52:14] <tsukkin> the united states still has literal slaves who are owned by the prison systems
[17:52:20] <Omega037> DunceCotus, read a book?
[17:52:36] <DunceCotus> history books are not necessarily truth
[17:52:39] <Omega037> ...
[17:52:45] <Omega037> Let's just stop
[17:53:12] <Omega037> I can't imagine the road you are about to embark on being anything worth discussing
[17:53:16] <tsukkin> the fact that everyone knows the phrase ' history is written by the victors ' but nobody likes to question what we know of history is very interesting to me
[17:53:29] <DunceCotus> tsukkin: right
[17:53:33] <Omega037> The point I was trying to make is that the original star wars was revolutionary and amazing for its time, but nowadays kinda sucks
[17:53:45] <Omega037> So I actually tend not to recommend people like tsukkin watch it
[17:53:48] <tsukkin> also true of capitalism 
[17:53:52] <DunceCotus> Omega037: original Star Wars films are still better than the latest ones
[17:53:56] <DunceCotus> and the prequel trilogies
[17:53:57] <Omega037> Unless they are doing it to understand the history of cinema
[17:54:00] <ButterNoodle> Omega037: whats up
[17:54:05] <DunceCotus> it isnt just a matter of rose-tinted glasses
[17:54:06] <Omega037> DunceCotus, only for nostalgia
[17:54:13] <DunceCotus> nuh-uh
[17:54:13] <tsukkin> i have little to no interest in western cinema on account of most of it being in english
[17:54:14] <Omega037> The original movies are pretty awful compared to now
[17:54:26] <Omega037> Like when you show them to young people now, they are not good
[17:54:38] <DunceCotus> young people want flashy things
[17:54:40] <Omega037> Everything from the special effects to the acting style to the story is very dated
[17:54:58] <Omega037> Not to mention, the story was original at the time but is now had 50000 copies
[17:54:58] <DunceCotus> Omega037: I dunno I feel the original trilogy is much more grounded
[17:55:02] <tsukkin> things tend to get ' dated ' when people try to imitate them
[17:55:05] <amigojapan> Omega037: in this I agree with DunceCotus original start wars was better
[17:55:09] <DunceCotus> silly too but more grounded in grime and dust
[17:55:11] <Omega037> tsukkin, exactly
[17:55:29] <tsukkin> for any given trope you see , you see it because someone did it very well at least once
[17:55:32] <Omega037> amigojapan, again it is hard to know unless you didn't see it previously
[17:55:36] <DunceCotus> everything from hollywood is too polished these days 
[17:55:41] <ButterNoodle> imitation is the best form of masturbation
[17:55:42] <DunceCotus> even the kids are polished
[17:56:00] <tsukkin> hey i spend a lot of time and effort polishing myself thank you very much
[17:56:10] <Omega037> Some art forms really can last
[17:56:14] <Omega037> Movies isn't one of them
[17:56:21] <Omega037> Anime can a bit better, but not really
[17:56:24] <DunceCotus> tsukkin: im sure you're beautiful
[17:56:39] <Omega037> I went back and watched some classic anime from the 60s and 70s, it isn't good
[17:56:54] <DunceCotus> Omega037: even astro boy
[17:56:57] <DunceCotus> ?
[17:57:00] <Omega037> especially astro boy
[17:57:02] <DunceCotus> xD
[17:57:06] <tsukkin> duncecotus probably not really but nobody is around to see me so i can pretend 
[17:57:16] <Omega037> I showed my kids a good deal
[17:57:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: astro boy is good
[17:57:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I don't necessarily disagree
[17:57:46] <Omega037> The fact is that there is very high quality animation bolstered by good computer assistance and full teams of writers and directors
[17:58:15] <Omega037> Drawing style from back then was weaker, and the need to save time made a LOT of repetitive stuff
[17:58:40] <Omega037> Like I totally get it, but it is pretty rough
[17:59:03] <DunceCotus> each era has its good and bad
[17:59:06] <Omega037> Sure
[17:59:13] <tsukkin> the really high quality animation from decades past still holds up
[17:59:15] <Bco1981> remember to stretch. https://yt3.ggpht.com/AAN1zEEOy2PO0NeCEEtpddnpjFf9TE86iu9RqvHXLuBJChgbJwspvpYxWKqloOPQX_GSH1502GjzSr8=s847-nd slightly nsfw

[17:59:20] <tsukkin> but there was a lot less ' high quality ' at the time
[17:59:24] <DunceCotus> there's too much focus groups or fan service in our era
[17:59:26] <Omega037> tsukkin, some isn't awful
[17:59:31] <Omega037> Almost none of it holds up
[17:59:33] <DunceCotus> its too treadmill or re-tread
[17:59:49] <Sadale> Bco1981, hawt :3
[17:59:50] <Omega037> This is true in most things
[18:00:03] <Omega037> The pyramids of Giza are amazing because they are ancient
[18:00:14] <Omega037> But Las Vegas proved we could rebuild bigger ones easily
[18:00:16] <DunceCotus> Omega037: no they're amazing cause we can't make them today
[18:00:23] <Omega037> Sure we can
[18:00:29] <Omega037> Pyramids?  Are you kidding?
[18:00:30] <DunceCotus> we can build hollow ones
[18:00:33] <DunceCotus> made of metal or glass
[18:00:35] <DunceCotus> big whoop
[18:00:48] <DunceCotus> pyramids were build with solid stone
[18:00:48] <Omega037> We could rebuild pyramids of stone easily
[18:00:56] <Omega037> Like jokingly simple
[18:01:08] <Omega037> We have power machniery
[18:01:08] <DunceCotus> Omega037: technically we could, but the system would have to be very different for that to happen
[18:01:12] <amigojapan> Cranes
[18:01:14] <DunceCotus> its not just about technical skill
[18:01:23] <Omega037> I feel like you are making my point for me
[18:01:30] <tsukkin> if i recall correctly the cranes we have are not powerful enough to do so
[18:01:40] <DunceCotus> Omega037: no, I stand by "we can't make them today"
[18:01:47] <DunceCotus> because we literally can't
[18:01:53] <Omega037> DunceCotus, that is insane
[18:02:01] <DunceCotus> we could if the system was different
[18:02:02] <Omega037> We build far larger stone structures all the time
[18:02:04] <DunceCotus> but because its not, we can't
[18:02:08] <amigojapan> tsukkin: use many smaller stones then
[18:02:19] <Omega037> DunceCotus, you are saying we can't build them using their tools
[18:02:23] <shadywitch> !quote darkwitch 2
[18:02:23] <ImoutoBot> shadywitch: (2 / 2) <darkwitch> thoth said the pyramids were built from the top down
[18:02:29] <DunceCotus> Omega037: no I am saying we can't build them with our system
[18:02:31] <Omega037> Sure...but that is my point
[18:02:31] <shadywitch> good luck :)
[18:02:33] <DunceCotus> we have the tools
[18:02:36] <Omega037> DunceCotus, huh
[18:02:46] <Omega037> We could build 50 pyramids of giza in a month
[18:02:48] <DunceCotus> there is no 'demand' for pyramids of solid stone
[18:02:58] <DunceCotus> our economic system doesn't allow for such marvels
[18:03:01] <tsukkin> amigojapan to completely recreate the great pyramids the way they exist is impossible

[18:03:24] <DunceCotus> Omega037: and its not just the pyramids either
[18:03:28] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there is a stone pyramid in Japan, modern one
[18:03:30] <DunceCotus> its also 'neoclassical' architecture
[18:03:34] <Omega037> Couple of people built one in their backyard
[18:03:37] <Omega037> It wasn't hard
[18:03:55] <DunceCotus> Omega037: not even close to being a comparison
[18:04:04] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: probably hollow
[18:04:04] <Omega037> It is a replica
[18:04:14] <tsukkin> not even close though that is two stories
[18:04:33] <Omega037> We built the Hoover Dam
[18:04:39] <Omega037> in the 1930s or something
[18:04:39] <DunceCotus> we can probably build the moon.. but it would be hollow
[18:04:39] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it contains a maze inside
[18:04:42] <DunceCotus> (the moon is hollow)
[18:04:56] <Omega037> DunceCotus, I feel like we are just talking past each other
[18:05:15] <DunceCotus> the Hoover Dam is quite the accomplishment admittedly
[18:05:19] <Omega037> DunceCotus, do you believe we currently have the technology to build stone buildings the size of the Pyramids easily?
[18:05:34] <DunceCotus> Omega037: not easily, but yes we could do it
[18:05:45] <DunceCotus> however the system dictates there is no demand for it
[18:05:51] <Omega037> By a team that regularly does large scale projects
[18:05:54] <DunceCotus> so it wont happen, therefore we can't.
[18:06:03] <Omega037> DunceCotus, that is irrelevant to this discussion
[18:06:10] <Omega037> I don't understand the point you want to make
[18:06:27] <DunceCotus> what i am interested in is not what is possible, but what is immanent
[18:06:36] <DunceCotus> anything is possible
[18:06:40] <Omega037> You seem to have missed the point of the discussion
[18:06:45] <DunceCotus> sun could randomly explode etc
[18:07:01] <DunceCotus> we could probably build a space elevator 
[18:07:07] <Omega037> ...
[18:07:07] <DunceCotus> but the problem is.. no demand
[18:07:12] <DunceCotus> economic system holds us back
[18:07:15] <Omega037> Again, who are you talking to right now?
[18:07:21] <DunceCotus> everyone
[18:07:21] <Omega037> Nobody is having this conversation
[18:07:29] <Sadale> me
[18:07:35] * Sadale is talking right now :3
[18:07:40] <Omega037> The conversation was about advances in technology in areas like animation
[18:07:53] <Omega037> And how it makes it so much more capable and easier
[18:07:54] <DunceCotus> Omega037: im not disputing that
[18:08:02] <DunceCotus> I was just saying we can't build the pyramids today
[18:08:13] <Omega037> So that while old animation is impressive in its time, it isnt now
[18:08:28] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimizu_Mega-City_Pyramid
[18:08:29] <ImoutoBot> [title] Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid - Wikipedia
[18:08:47] <Omega037> The only point was that building the Pyramids was an amazing feat 5000 years ago
[18:08:51] <Omega037> But would not be now
[18:08:52] <Sadale> I guess those old animations were probably drawn frame-by-frame
[18:09:07] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its like Kowloon walled city done right
[18:09:09] <Omega037> Since building a much larger and more complex building is common
[18:09:20] <Omega037> Sadale, yes, which is also why they re-used a LOT
[18:09:31] <Omega037> and everything looks kinda laggy and repetitive
[18:09:49] <DunceCotus> Omega037: we do not have the system to make such megalithic marvels
[18:09:50] <Omega037> Steamboat Willie was amazing in 1930s
[18:09:59] <Omega037> DunceCotus, define system?
[18:10:02] <Sadale> amigojapan, wow. It reminds me of the world of Girls' Last Tour.
[18:10:02] <DunceCotus> our system can pump out soulless buildings, sure
[18:10:06] <Omega037> We have the technology for sure
[18:10:18] <DunceCotus> Omega037: capitalism
[18:10:19] <Omega037> We could build a Pyramid on the moon with our current technological level
[18:10:27] <Omega037> DunceCotus, yeah I don't get your point
[18:10:37] <DunceCotus> it doesn't matter what we are skilled in
[18:10:39] <Sadale> amigojapan, In their world, the cities were built to have many floors. Maybe they took the inspiration from the mega pyramid project
[18:10:40] <Omega037> Nobody is saying we are going to
[18:10:43] <amigojapan> Yep Sadale 
[18:10:45] <DunceCotus> what matters is whether those skills are utilised
[18:10:50] <DunceCotus> and for what
[18:10:54] <tsukkin> amigojapan no way anyone has the money to build that
[18:11:03] <ezekielnoob> man
[18:11:05] <ezekielnoob> i need a chair upgrade
[18:11:08] <Omega037> This is about technology
[18:11:09] <ezekielnoob> do you guys trust online chair reviews
[18:11:21] <Omega037> DunceCotus, not if the discussion is about technology process
[18:11:35] <DunceCotus> technology is only as good as its users
[18:11:36] <Omega037> This is like saying "we can't make a better VHS tape"
[18:11:40] <shadywitch> forget the chair and sit on a pyramid
[18:11:47] <Omega037> Of course we can, 1000x better
[18:11:57] <Omega037> Obviously there is no demand so we wont
[18:11:57] <Sadale> tsukkin, the government :P
[18:11:58] <amigojapan> tsukkin: cause it will house 1 million people?
[18:11:59] <tsukkin> omega037 star wars is a vhs tape ?
[18:12:05] <Omega037> Not the remaster
[18:12:08] <Omega037> With the added effects
[18:12:11] <DunceCotus> betamax
[18:12:14] <tsukkin> amigojapan well it requires materials that literally do not exist
[18:12:33] <Omega037> DunceCotus, there are few older things that we couldn't reproduce
[18:12:33] <Sadale> I don't quite see the point of building such a pyramid with all those alternatives available tho
[18:12:46] <amigojapan> tsukkin: we will see
[18:12:56] <Omega037> sigh, why do I even bother?
[18:13:00] <DunceCotus> Omega037: knowing how to do it is one thing
[18:13:03] <DunceCotus> actually doing it is another
[18:13:24] <DunceCotus> I would say actually they are linked
[18:13:36] <shadywitch> Sadale, architects usually have many silly ideas that they get approved
[18:13:51] <Sadale> shadywitch, but this one is of different scale
[18:13:53] <DunceCotus> we may think we know how to build pyramids with today's tech, but I have a feeling we don't really know (and that's why they don't get built)
[18:14:12] <DunceCotus> its not about carving and placing stone

[18:15:12] <Omega037> DunceCotus, the amazing part of the Pyramids was moving such large stones 5000 years ago
[18:15:19] <Omega037> Nowadays we could fabricate the stones
[18:15:30] <Omega037> Shape them and put them in place on demand
[18:15:39] <Omega037> Truly not that hard
[18:15:40] <DunceCotus> Omega037: then why don't we

[18:15:56] <Omega037> Pyramid stones are about the weight of a car
[18:16:11] <Omega037> DunceCotus, I mean I showed you a couple who did in their backyard for fun
[18:16:14] <Omega037> So we do
[18:16:25] <DunceCotus> Omega037: they say the pyramids were built top-down
[18:16:48] <DunceCotus> how people would have done that 5000 years ago is a huge mystery
[18:16:58] <Omega037> Sure
[18:17:07] <Omega037> But today we would just use concrete molds
[18:17:17] <Omega037> With precise mixtures that maximize strength
[18:17:23] <DunceCotus> if we tried to do it today (if there was ever demand for it), it would be shoddier
[18:17:29] <DunceCotus> and probably mostly hollow
[18:17:30] <Omega037> And then use cranes and such to move them into place
[18:17:37] <Omega037> DunceCotus, it would be FAR stronger
[18:17:48] <Omega037> Pyramid stones are a joke compared to modern conrete
[18:17:51] <DunceCotus> Omega037: it wouldn't last 500 years let alone 5000
[18:17:52] <Omega037> Especially reinforced
[18:18:03] <Omega037> I mean, the actual pyramids didn't last that well
[18:18:08] <Omega037> All the cover stones are gone
[18:18:11] <DunceCotus> Omega037: sure
[18:18:16] <Omega037> But you are wrong
[18:18:19] <DunceCotus> but its still impressive to this day
[18:18:27] <Omega037> I think you underestimate how much better we are at materials now
[18:18:44] <Omega037> Steel-reinforced concrete is pretty strong
[18:18:47] <DunceCotus> I think you overestimate the system
[18:18:52] <Omega037> We could also just build the whole thing out of steel
[18:19:10] <Omega037> You are saying we dont want to, and I 100% agree
[18:19:18] <Omega037> I just don't know WHY you keep saying that
[18:19:22] <DunceCotus> desire produces reality
[18:19:24] <Omega037> Nobody is saying we SHOULD or WILL
[18:19:33] <DunceCotus> if there is no desire, it doesn't happen
[18:19:34] <Omega037> I think it would be a horrific waste of money
[18:19:40] <Omega037> So does almost everyone else
[18:19:53] <Omega037> Just like building a new VHS player
[18:20:04] <DunceCotus> we waste money on a lot worse
[18:20:12] <Omega037> So?
[18:20:15] <DunceCotus> like Tesla factories or Mars landers
[18:20:22] <Omega037> So?
[18:20:34] <DunceCotus> why not spend that cash on proper recycling plants
[18:20:37] <Omega037> DunceCotus, we agree that there is no demand to rebuild Pyramids
[18:20:46] <DunceCotus> or aesthetic marvels like pyramids
[18:20:55] <Omega037> That isn't the question
[18:21:01] <DunceCotus> what is the question?
[18:21:16] <Omega037> DunceCotus, regardless of demand to do so, could we rebuild the Pyramids with our current technology?
[18:21:21] <DunceCotus> no
[18:21:25] <Omega037> sigh
[18:21:33] <Omega037> Okay, lets just stop talking then
[18:21:38] <DunceCotus> if we could, we likely would have done so
[18:21:45] <Omega037> Either you are trolling or actually this stupid
[18:21:52] <Omega037> Either way, I don't care to continue
[18:22:07] <DunceCotus> our ability is proportional to our desire
[18:22:21] <Omega037> Yeah, just stop talking about it or I'm putting you on ignore
[18:22:43] <DunceCotus> ok
[18:22:56] <Omega037> Anyways, old movies and such are great in their time, but most don't hold up
[18:23:06] <Omega037> Some do, sometimes...but it is hard to have perspective
[18:23:26] <Omega037> I'll show my kids Star Wars in a few years and see what they think, having seen all the modern scifi movies and animation

"But keep in mind that there can be multiple students with the same StudentID." "...Wait, what?"

[21:46:49] <isekaijin> Nanobot: Have these people never heard of this simple technique called “making a truly unique ID that is different from the ID that users see”?
[21:47:32] <isekaijin> (Because human desires are fickle, and they might someday want to make the previously unique ID not unique anymore.)
[21:48:20] <isekaijin> Basically, never trust human users with the actual primary key.
[21:49:57] <Nanobot> isekaijin: Let me put it this way... the fields like "SequenceNumber" are just the human-readable names of the fields. The tables and fields are actually named things like "STJ.SQ". And there are LOTS of cases where fields have an arbitrary number of "XX1", "XX2", etc. columns where it would make much more sense to have a separate table instead.
[21:50:15] <Nanobot> Lots of old outdated design in this thing.
[21:51:44] <isekaijin> Managing that database is going to be fun. Good luck!
[21:52:14] <Nanobot> This is a third party system. I'm working on something that will pull data from it and import it into our system.
[21:55:38] <isekaijin> Will your system be constantly pulling data from the third party system? Or is it a one-off thing?
[21:56:15] <Nanobot> Constant.
[21:57:17] <Nanobot> Another thing that makes this annoying is the system splits the data into different databases for different schoolyears. So, it's possible for one primary key to represent different records for different schoolyears, even though I need to track the same logical record across schoolyears.

[22:03:55] <isekaijin> So, say, the same student can have different IDs in different years?
[22:07:31] <Nanobot> More likely that two different students could have the same ID in different years. I believe they simply copy all returning students into the new database and then start assigning new student IDs from whatever the highest number in this schoolyear is.
[22:08:23] <Nanobot> So, if a student leaves and then comes back later, I think they would have a different student ID.
[22:09:04] <Nanobot> And if a high-numbered student doesn't return the next year, someone else might be assigned that student ID.

[22:16:19] <Jigsy> Aren't they responsible for printing money?
[22:18:03] <Nanobot> They run out of money because they have a self-imposed thing called the "debt ceiling" that one party uses to hold the country hostage to get the other party to make concessions, except that the first party forgot that's why they're holding it hostage, so now they just hold it hostage every year just to hurt the country.

[22:35:24] <Vohveli> recently I've been watching more of Japanese clips, subtitled in Japanese
[22:36:53] <Bco1981> what pisses me off the most about these clippers and "uploaders" is that they don't leave a link for the source. and they don't care about it. because some nice person will do it some where in the 1000 comments... i'm not gonna read through that... instant dislike. and i whish i could take back my view count.
[22:37:44] <Bco1981> if it's stream clips or anime clips. it's the same
[22:38:44] <Vohveli> huh, I haven't really encountered sourceless clips all that much
[22:38:58] <Bco1981> it takes longer for them to get the video, cut it, save it, upload it... then copy+paste a f'ing link.
[22:39:56] <Bco1981> hmm lately i haven't either because i haven't been looking much at clips.
