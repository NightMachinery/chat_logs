[10:50:36] <CableNinja> sometime this week or next I'm gonna sit down with our lead platform dev and figure out how they cut a new version so I can automate it
[10:50:44] <JollyRgrs> and the more times someone in mgmt hears "lazy admin" the harder it is to fight for automation

[10:52:39] <JollyRgrs> i mean, be smart about it... a one-off thing you have to do for 2 devices, if it isn't a horribly complicated ordeal... just do it manual

[10:53:03] <xe0n> more time in debugging that than actually doing the thing
[10:53:03] <xe0n> lol
[10:53:06] <JollyRgrs> but if you have time to write a script... i'd even do it for that, just to make sure I can "go over" my steps mult. times... even if I just run the script "1 line at a time" as I watch it
[10:53:08] <CableNinja> cray.io yeah, I was kinda similar, well sorta... I started into IT as a young teen, learned game modding, wanted to showcase my mod, so I needed to learn how to make a website, then I needed to know how to host it, and eventually fell into my career path

[19:11:38] <sintax> vinrock: go ahead
[19:11:42] <vinrock> got a generic tblet that keeps booting into recovery
[19:11:47] <vinrock> i assume the stock rom is corrupted
[19:12:03] <vinrock> is there any way to copy the stock rom off a working device and fix this one
[19:12:24] <thegodsquirrel> Wouldn't you need a JTAG to do that?
[19:12:26] <technonerd> you can push the stock rom in recovery
[19:12:28] <vinrock> recovery mode only has the option to update from external storage
[19:12:33] <mistiry> do you have the stock rom?
[19:12:35] <vinrock> nope
[19:12:51] <mistiry> well, for starters you need that or another working rom for your device
[19:12:53] <vinrock> its one of the ELD tablets for our trucks, these things are locked down
[19:12:59] <mistiry> then you can load it with adb
[19:13:05] <csws> you can flash with fastboot if it's unlocked
[19:13:05] <vinrock> yeah thats what im wondering if theres a way to pull it from a working device

[19:13:21] <csws> RMA
[19:13:26] <vinrock> poop
[19:13:28] <mistiry> not that i know of, i mean may be a way but its beyond my knowledge

[19:13:39] <vinrock> not posible
[19:13:48] <csws> probably if yo'ure a turbo autismo with android

[19:19:05] <mistiry> to a pair of cisco ISR's
[19:19:17] <mistiry> we were CLOSE

[19:21:09] <vinrock> ah cool
[19:21:13] <mistiry> the ELD think would have integrated so good

[20:08:42] <sintax> and i've spent over $70k in the past two months. 
[20:08:44] <csws> something something no gifts from vendors
[20:08:52] <sintax> heck with that
[20:08:54] <sintax> gift away!
[20:09:00] <Jaelae> we spend quite a bit
[20:09:03] <signofzeta> I traded 20 minutes of my time with an HPE sales engineer, in exchange for $100 of GrubHub money.  Most of the call was just me saying, "you should really talk to my manager.  you've reached the help desk."  But they paid me.
[20:09:11] <Jaelae> millions a month 
[20:09:31] <csws> oh man one time a sales guy called helldesk and my colleague got it in his head he had to transfer the call to our general manager
[20:09:43] <csws> told him nooo don't you'll get fired...
[20:09:49] <csws> thankfully the GM was afk
[20:11:40] <oxipital> i'll take free money in spite of "ethics"

[20:15:01] <PublicWiFi> I think exchange 2016 CU21 is the last...
[20:15:07] <PublicWiFi> now I can coast this bitch till support runs out lol
[20:15:19] <csws> why don't you upgrade to 2019
[20:15:20] <oxipital> awesome. time for corporate training zoom
[20:15:26] <PublicWiFi> im gonna try to push for O365
[20:15:33] <csws> >2021
[20:15:37] <csws> >on prem mailboxes
[20:15:39] <PublicWiFi> ^
[20:15:57] <DrZak> tbh. o365 setups comes with all kinds of problems
[20:16:03] <PublicWiFi> yeah
[20:16:08] <PublicWiFi> not sure if I want grey hair or not
[20:16:13] <PublicWiFi> but having a single exchange box is also retarded
[20:16:16] <DrZak> the network connection investigation is rather sad
[20:16:30] <DrZak> you can have two!
[20:16:31] <DrZak> ;)
[20:16:59] <PublicWiFi> somethings gotta give
[20:17:00] <PublicWiFi> lol
[20:17:31] <PublicWiFi> dang i forgot about my cisco ESA on prem... I'm sure I can interface that with O365 one way or another
[20:17:31] <DrZak> not to mention if you are german, you get intestinal problems with data in the cloud
[20:17:59] <csws> PublicWiFi, if they can use a smarthost then no big deal
[20:18:05] <DrZak> PublicWiFi: if you do 'kill all macros' 'remove exefiles and send the rest' you wont have those options in EOP
[20:18:07] <csws> with client certificate authentication preferably
[20:18:30] <PublicWiFi> pretty sure cisco esa can do smarthost
[20:18:31] <csws> oh you want to relay shit through them?
[20:18:31] <DrZak> but you cen buy cisco ESA cloud, put it infront EOP
[20:18:33] <csws> you could use a connector
[20:18:42] *** Joins: Aoyagi (~yags@user/aoyagi)
[20:18:50] <csws> like exo -> ESA -> internet
[20:18:52] <PublicWiFi> yeah if we move to 0365 we'd have to move the ESA to cloud too 
[20:18:54] <csws> kinda sucks though
[20:19:09] <PublicWiFi> then again I'm pretty sure exchange online has an encryption service right?
[20:19:14] <PublicWiFi> with keywords and etc
[20:19:17] <AnonymooseReddtr> yes
[20:19:25] <DrZak> and then you are in the money that will make your financial guy grow a second asshole to bleed from
[20:19:26] <AnonymooseReddtr> you can do DLP 
[20:19:38] <PublicWiFi> yup lol
[20:19:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> can do enryption too
[20:19:51] <AnonymooseReddtr> hell you can bring your own encryption keys ;)
[20:19:58] <DrZak> if you encrypt the content, you are fucked
[20:20:02] <PublicWiFi> do you usually put an email security appliance or service in front of your o365 service?
[20:20:05] <DrZak> coz then its pretty much useless
[20:20:07] <CptLuxx> no
[20:20:07] <signofzeta> Yes, you need Microsoft 365 E3 or higher for the built-in encryption.
[20:20:15] <PublicWiFi> yuck
[20:20:35] <AnonymooseReddtr> PublicWiFi no
[20:20:36] <PublicWiFi> before i came on our ESA license lapsed and they were flooded with phish spam lol
[20:20:38] <signofzeta> No, I just send everything into Exchange Online directly.  You pay for Microsoft to filter your spam.  Change the settings to suit your needs.
[20:20:45] <PublicWiFi> so o365 is pretty decent at filtering bullshit?
[20:20:49] <DrZak> since encrypted content with double key encryption cant be scanned, cant be indexed, can't be checked for dlp, just fial
[20:20:51] <csws> pretty decent
[20:20:56] <CptLuxx> yep
[20:20:58] <AnonymooseReddtr> just pay extra for EOP 
[20:20:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> but ya
[20:20:59] <PublicWiFi> hmm nice
[20:21:07] <csws> tweak the BCL in your spam policy tho
[20:21:09] <PublicWiFi> we use encrypted email pretty heavily
[20:21:25] <DrZak> EOP is inside all licenses, the problem is it has very limited set of options
[20:21:26] <PublicWiFi> ill have to lay all this out on "paper"
[20:21:27] <csws> used trend micro cloud app security to do after delivery scanning
[20:21:28] <signofzeta> Could be better, but good enough.  The only thing I see come through are phishing emails sent from compromised M365 customers.
[20:21:28] <csws> it kinda sucked
[20:21:36] <csws> UX was trash and the security guy would alwyas block stupid shit
[20:21:37] <DrZak> even if you splurge extra for 'microsoft 365 defender'
[20:21:49] <PublicWiFi> signofzeta: most of our phish email comes from trusted 3rd parties who were pwnd
[20:21:54] <csws> new joint uses TMES on the MX records.. it's pretty trash too. I hate trend micro :(
[20:22:06] <AnonymooseReddtr> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/email-encryption?view=o365-worldwide
[20:22:08] <csws> EOP + ATP is superior to the trend offerings imo
[20:22:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> ^^
[20:22:24] <csws> no idea about mimecast or ESA or whatever the hell lol
[20:22:32] <PublicWiFi> i just know as soon as I switch to 0365 itll have some bullshit outage lol
[20:22:39] <PublicWiFi> like the same week
[20:22:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[20:22:57] <csws> and the outage will be hidden in an advisory saying "some users are experiencing issues sending e-mails to PublicWiFi"
[20:23:05] <PublicWiFi> do hybrid setups usually store mailbox data too? or just mostly used to interface with AD correctly?
[20:23:10] <PublicWiFi> csws: ++++
[20:23:28] <csws> we've got a few mailboxes on prem because of legacy trash
[20:23:33] <csws> very legacy
[20:23:51] <PublicWiFi> are they are stored in a 365 box too or naw?
[20:24:06] <csws> MS only officially supports managing remote mailboxes with an on prem exchange
[20:24:14] <PublicWiFi> right
[20:24:17] <PublicWiFi> which is lame xD
[20:24:17] <csws> like 10 mailboxes on prem
[20:24:19] <csws> few thousand on cloud
[20:24:30] <csws> still journaling on prem
[20:24:30] * csws vomits
[20:24:34] <PublicWiFi> id like to nuke the exchange VM
[20:24:38] <csws> you have to keep it
[20:24:41] <PublicWiFi> yeah rip
[20:24:53] <signofzeta> If you're using a Hybrid license, you're not supposed to keep any mailboxes locally unless they're also licensed for M365.  Otherwise, you need a Standard license (paid).
[20:24:58] <csws> yeah well do cloud autodiscovery, move all your users and whatnot.. then you don't have to expose it to the net
[20:25:02] <csws> at least you don't get completely blown out by the next RCE
[20:25:10] <PublicWiFi> oh nice
[20:25:11] <csws> yeah
[20:25:17] <AnonymooseReddtr> yah you don't need to expose it to the web which is nice
[20:25:28] <AnonymooseReddtr> but you SHOULD have an on prem exchange server
[20:25:47] <PublicWiFi> ive heard of people going without with no issues
[20:25:51] <csws> yeah but it's free(TM) with the hybrid license as signofzeta said
[20:25:51] <PublicWiFi> its just MS won't help you if something happens lol
[20:26:01] <csws> but you must move every mailbox
[20:26:15] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> them not having issues is not indicative of doing things the right way
[20:26:17] <AnonymooseReddtr> csws yeah but you can move mailboxes as shared mailboxes etc. 
[20:26:21] <csws> yeah company I was at a while ago had no on prem exchange. they used the messageops ADUC addin to manage everything
[20:26:22] <DrZak> i am pissed MS dropped support from o 2013 when you hook it up to o365
[20:26:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> you CAN do it without it
[20:26:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> but
[20:26:32] <DrZak> even though o 2013 is still in support
[20:26:33] <DrZak> :/
[20:26:34] <AnonymooseReddtr> you kinda get fucked
[20:26:36] <PublicWiFi> well if you never had on-prem its cool
[20:26:38] <PublicWiFi> right?
[20:26:47] <PublicWiFi> hybrid is the weird spot
[20:26:49] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> 2013 is still supported for o365
[20:26:50] <signofzeta> DrZak: set EnableADAL in the registry and it will still connect, even if support is lacking
[20:27:00] <sd> 06<C​omputer man, fix my pants!> just needs to be fully patched
[20:27:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> PublicWiFi if you've never had on prem - and you want to do hybird 
[20:27:03] <DrZak> if you synchronize AD, you need an exchange server to manage it
[20:27:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> ^^
[20:27:07] <DrZak> signofzeta: yea yea
[20:27:10] <oxipital> ut oh zoom wants me to install an audio enhancement package
[20:27:12] <DrZak> who knows how long though
[20:27:27] <AnonymooseReddtr> DrZak long term my guess is it will STILL need the exchange AD objects
[20:27:35] <signofzeta> DrZak: and to avoid warnings, disable the Outlook Social Connector -- it's no longer supported, either.
[20:27:37] * oxipital installs chinese AI ML keystroke capture
[20:27:47] <csws> I mean you can go without but.. man
[20:27:55] <DrZak> signofzeta: ooh, good point, gotta bug the guy
[20:27:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> i couldn't
[20:27:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> err i wouldn't
[20:28:11] <csws> like you can get a mailbox provisioned with a bare minimum of mail, proxyAddresses, mailNickname and targetAddress set

[20:28:40] * oxipital thinks so
[20:28:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> so
[20:28:50] <oxipital> via the wonder of ps
[20:28:52] <csws> actually you don't need any
[20:28:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> I had a client that did this 
[20:28:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> got rid of on prem exchange
[20:28:58] <csws> if you just license they get the UPN as their primary e-mail lol
[20:29:03] <AnonymooseReddtr> did a cutover to office 365
[20:29:06] <AnonymooseReddtr> but still had Azure AD 
[20:29:11] <DrZak> you can do all of that, but, in case something doesn't work, MS won't support you
[20:29:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> and AADConnect
[20:29:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> it was BRUTAL
[20:29:17] <PublicWiFi> so at MS MSRP 60 e1 licenses is roughly 5500 per year. I'm sure my VAR can get it cheaper
[20:29:20] <csws> man
[20:29:20] <oxipital> oh hell thuis greybeard is in a room with a huge echo
[20:29:31] <PublicWiFi> whereas MS exchange is kinda cheap lol
[20:29:38] <AnonymooseReddtr> 60 E1 O365 E1 licenses? should be like $5 each per month
[20:29:40] <DrZak> also, it's not just targetaddress and proxyaddress, but also msExchRecipienttype and recipienttypedetails
[20:29:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> ^
[20:29:50] <PublicWiFi> AnonymooseReddtr: yeah MSRP on theri site is like 8 bucks, so I know it can be cheaper
[20:29:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> also your mailboxGUID
[20:29:56] <csws> AnonymooseReddtr, I was helping some guys separate from our AD for a demerger and they were looking at using AAD Connect rules to rewrite e-mails and shit as they had no access to AD itself
[20:29:57] <csws> was just insanity
[20:30:10] <csws> msExchMailboxGuid
[20:30:12] <AnonymooseReddtr> csws yuck
[20:30:25] <AnonymooseReddtr> csws yes the ExchMailboxGuid
[20:31:09] <csws> DrZak, you don't need them
[20:31:20] <csws> if you license them it provisions a mailbox and generates that in the cloud
[20:31:25] <PublicWiFi> so roughly 4k per year for our current userbase.. that's pretty steep man
[20:31:34] <PublicWiFi> that's not including the e3's for the office apps
[20:31:41] <DrZak> csws: oh, right
[20:31:54] <PublicWiFi> gotta figure out how to spin this for the bean counters

[20:33:30] <csws> PublicWiFi, you got a VL arrangement?
[20:33:33] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> yea but you really want *at least* two servers (preferrably four) plus you need exchange 2019 CALs for every user

[21:07:03] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> most big vendors have had 10 year cycles or somewhere in the 5-10 year range for major product releases for the past ~25 years or so
[21:07:20] <csws> the haproxy plugin is a little easier to work on pfsense
[21:07:21] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> 10 is industry standard IMO
[21:07:23] <PublicWiFi> does opnsense hav ewireguard built in?
[21:07:23] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> Win2k was the first to get the full 10 year cycle
[21:07:32] <csws> like you can do rules in the same UI as the frontend. lots of clicking with opnsense but the UI is friendlier

[21:07:35] <sd> 09<h​ayden> opnsense is the 'better' version of pfsense's original project, right?
[21:07:36] <csws> yeah but same limitations
[21:07:39] <PublicWiFi> ah
[21:07:41] <csws> it's plugin based

[21:07:51] <sd> 06<A​da> opnsense and pfsense wireguard are both plguins

[21:08:01] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yeah... Debian as well
[21:08:01] <sd> 06<A​da> i still stick with pfsense just out of habit tbh
[21:08:04] <sd> 09<h​ayden> Modularity is great
[21:08:07] <PublicWiFi> yeah same 
[21:08:26] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @sysadmin debian's support lifecycle is "i can't use this in production, your shit is so random"
[21:08:28] <csws> @hayden, yeah forked. uses a python backend to do the privileged tasks and phalcon for the frontend. better security that way as the PHP app on pfsense literally runs as root
[21:08:29] <thegodsquirrel> pfsense is nice and I already have an SG-2440
[21:08:31] <PublicWiFi> might be better to just setup a nix* box to handle wireguard

[21:08:53] <thegodsquirrel> If that Netgate box dies, I'll put opnsense on my old MBP

[21:09:05] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @sysadmin sure, i don't disagree that it's rock solid
[21:09:08] <sd> 06<A​da> yeah, thats what i did since
[21:09:10] <csws> on linux
[21:09:10] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but the support lifecycles are bloody *random*

[21:09:27] <sd> 09<h​ayden> csws: wtf? I write PHP code for a living (sadly) and I wouldn't even DREAM of running PHP as root, that's a stupidly huge security flaw
[21:09:33] <PublicWiFi> cause my openvpn setup is so fuckin slow, the lack of aes-ni really hurts it
[21:09:38] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yes
[21:09:45] <PublicWiFi> something like 10mbps lol
[21:09:49] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @sysadmin and without vendor paid support and the ability for guaranteed cycles, there's a lot of cases we just can't legally use it at all (contractual or regulatory reasons) so it's just not anywhere
