[09:48:57] <catt[m]> Isn't being able to upload php, js, html, or any other web stuff a kind of vulnerability?
[09:49:15] <gnoo> no, since the server says the stuff is text/plain not text/html
[09:49:22] <gnoo> and browser interprets that as such
[09:49:23] <catt[m]> Oh
[09:49:34] <catt[m]> So its just the browser doing it
[09:49:37] <catt[m]> Not the server
[09:50:11] <gnoo> yeah, html is rendered client-side so as long as your browser doesn't render text/plain as text/html, it should be fine

[09:51:00] <catt[m]> If the site is running some js that does something malicious when something happens
[09:51:16] <gnoo> why would it be? it's just files and if you say to your webserver: anything in this directory is text file and nothing else, it shoudn't matter
[09:51:28] <catt[m]> Oh ok
[09:52:02] <gnoo> why would the site be running js at all?
[09:52:16] <catt[m]> So theres smth in a webserver you can configure to not treat anything in specific directories as html/whatever else
[09:52:23] <catt[m]> gnoo: Good question

[14:12:52] <catt[m]> Wow im good at guessing
[14:13:02] <potatoxel[m]> with time travel thing and paradox
[14:13:05] <labrador> how do you all press 'n' and 't'? Like do you stretch your hand from the home row and press them or move your hand for a little while to another row then stretch the finger a little to press?
[14:13:08] <catt[m]> Show
[14:13:08] <potatoxel[m]> tho the time travel is extremely simple
[14:13:11] <catt[m]> And what lang is it
[14:13:17] <catt[m]> Also itll be free software right
[14:13:30] <labrador> I know its off topic but there isn't a typing chan on libera
[14:13:32] <potatoxel[m]> gdscript
[14:13:36] <potatoxel[m]> the game is agplv3
[14:14:01] <potatoxel[m]> yees it is free under the GNU AGPLv3
[14:14:05] <catt[m]> potatoxel[m]: Godot
[14:14:13] <catt[m]> Huh, never heard of that before
[14:14:20] <catt[m]> Is it an easy lang, hard lang, or somewhere in the middle
[14:14:26] <potatoxel[m]> its easy
[14:14:38] <catt[m]> Does it give u a lot of functionality
[14:14:42] <catt[m]> To do thinhs
[14:14:44] <catt[m]> Things
[14:14:55] <catt[m]> Like 3d support
[14:14:58] <potatoxel[m]> Yeah
[14:15:01] <potatoxel[m]> It has 2d and 3d
[14:15:06] <catt[m]> Cool
[14:15:09] <potatoxel[m]> but 3d people dont like it
[14:15:12] <potatoxel[m]> but im using it anyway
[14:15:17] <potatoxel[m]> and some people made good stuf with it
[14:15:31] <potatoxel[m]> godot 4.0 will have better 3d than rn
[14:15:31] <catt[m]> Seems similar to python
[14:15:44] <catt[m]> potatoxel[m]: cool
[14:16:59] <catt[m]> I found some list of early 200s X11 free software games written in C a while ago, it was interesting

[18:11:53] <potatoxel[m]> ty
[18:11:58] <catt[m]> Theres a lot of explaining and not as much just code
[18:12:31] <catt[m]> Which is nice since the thing i need to remember is the logic behind things, not example programs
[18:13:53] <potatoxel[m]> noic
[18:14:03] <potatoxel[m]> the most i did in C was a simple http server
[18:14:17] <potatoxel[m]> can just serve static files
[18:14:24] <potatoxel[m]> it was an assignment in uni
[18:14:34] <catt[m]> Oh nice
[18:14:46] <catt[m]> More than ive done
[18:14:49] <catt[m]> lol
[18:15:11] <potatoxel[m]> well it was less than 500 lines of code
[18:15:38] <catt[m]> Yeah, im just starting to learn C
[18:16:07] <catt[m]> So i havent made a big program
[18:16:16] <potatoxel[m]> ah :3
[18:16:43] <catt[m]> Im trying to learn as of recently though
[18:16:49] <catt[m]> So ill see how that goes

[19:45:10] <ggoes> language is bloat, we should limit ourselves to 100 semantic units so we can have lean communication and software /s
[19:45:43] <TheLinuxNerd> 0-255 let's speak hex :-D
[19:45:48] <ggoes> too bloated
[19:46:10] <TheLinuxNerd> FF could be an insult and 00 could be okay :-D
[19:46:37] <Andrew> qrpnxz: xml is the problem
[19:46:46] <qrpnxz> we should do 26 units so we can use the letters. I know it seems arbitrary but it actually fits an arbitrary standard so it's okay. :D
[19:46:47] <kompowiec2> language is bloated, only lojban
[19:46:56] <Andrew> ill showcase it
[19:47:11] <qrpnxz> Andrew, and other than that?

[19:51:41] <qrpnxz> so it's basically perfect cool
[19:51:49] <qrpnxz> that's a good only "problem" to have
[19:52:05] <Andrew> I disagree with the second url tbh
[19:52:42] <Andrew> It's not a question of religion – it's not true that one format is like another – there are clear and logical technical reasons why XML and specifically the XMPP dialect of XML are unsuitable for instant messaging applications. These deficiencies can be compensated by using more processing power and network bandwidth, but still they could be avoided (look at syntax for an example):
[19:52:47] <Andrew> agreed with this
[19:53:47] <jxself> That's the great thing about these technical opinions. There are so many of them! :)
[19:53:56] <ggoes> haha
[19:58:34] <qrpnxz> xmpp dialect of xml is basically xml 1.0 with perhaps some minor difference that i hardly remember now (no dtd i think?)
[19:59:18] <catt[m]> <Andrew> "cat: irc?" <- How do i get irc?
[19:59:52] <Andrew> catt[m]: https://libera.chat is the network I'm on
[20:00:07] <Andrew> catt[m]: There are a lot of clients, HexChat is a popular one
[20:00:46] <kompowiec2> there are no alternatives to regexp so as not to brainwash yourself? I download the page via import request (python) and then go over it with a regex, and it crashed brain through the HTML on the pages.

[20:04:30] <Andrew> catt[m]: ii
[20:05:18] <Andrew> Ofc your ip is made clear to everyone, But if you register your nickname with NickServ and get a cloak in #libera-cloaks before you join channels, youre good

[20:08:06] <Andrew> you'd probably want to get an user interface for it first

[20:08:25] <catt[m]> I dont want a gui
[20:08:29] <catt[m]> I want a tui
[20:08:30] <Andrew> weechat is extensible in more ways and has relay clients, though hats not as useful
[20:08:39] <Andrew> I don't have xorg on some systems
[20:08:42] <catt[m]> Not a cli cause thats too basic to display much info

[20:09:15] <catt[m]> Andrew: What does that mean
[20:09:27] <Andrew> it treats channels as unix named pipes
