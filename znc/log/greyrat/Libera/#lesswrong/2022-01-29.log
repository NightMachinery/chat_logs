[01:37:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Injections? Eugh
[01:38:23] <gwern> adiabatic: they're working on an oral! and again, -15% body weight. hell, I don't think I've lost 15% body weight in like 6 years of lifting
[01:38:38] <adiabatic> gwern: best COVID news I've heard in a while!
[01:38:41] <gwern> and I bet it's a teeny tiny injection, it's a hormone
[01:38:46] <gwern> adiabatic: yes, that too...
[01:39:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok so again: should we all be taking it?
[01:39:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it available OTC? (I assume not)
[01:39:48] <adiabatic> I'm moderately spooked by thyroid cancer

[01:41:17] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: but yeah, if it was OTC and didn't cost $1k/month, I'd be pretty seriously contemplating the argument that everyone with a BMI above average should be taking it
[01:42:12] * gwern doesn't really begrudge nordisk the price because this is the result of decades of painstaking incremental research iterating on the -glutides to get something that can work so well and so safely. but it's a pity that the rollout will be slowed
[01:42:27] <adiabatic> this is probably way better news if you're a fat zoomer. it'll be way cheaper in 20 years when it goes off-patent. see also: zithromax

[03:18:16] <gwern> I've gotten angry enough at their deliberate low quality to start trying out the competitors who have finally surfaced
[03:18:18] <adiabatic> mostly my opinion of Logitech was formed, like, 30 years ago so I struggle to stay current
[03:19:12] <gwern> in this case, the scroll wheel broke like a week before the warranty expired, but I didn't check the returns until too late because it was the holidays and I was generally busy
[03:21:08] <gwern> it is really infuriating that they have a great thumb trackball design and then insist on saving what is surely like pennies by using switches and wheels they know wear out and break at the drop of a hat, because the reliability situation has been unchanged for a decade

People began dying from mysterious ailments, but even when arsenic poisoning was identified as the source, both designers and the public refused to believe it or to give up their arsenical greens.

Primates and rodents living in research colonies, feral rodents living in our cities, and domestic pets like dogs and cats are all steadily getting fatter and fatter. This can’t be attributed to changes in what they eat, because lab animals live in contained environments with highly controlled
[12:48:25] <Obormot\Arcturus>  diets. They’re being fed the same foods as always, but for some reason, they’re getting fatter."
[12:48:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This seems to be true everywhere you look. Our pets may eat scraps from the table, but why would zoo animals, being fed by professionals, also be getting fatter? Even horses are becoming more obese."

[12:55:21] <kuudes> yeah, it seems clear we do not know what causes the obesity, and even more clear that we seem to have no effective treatment for it currently
[12:55:47] <kuudes> or well, we have effective but not tolerable treatments
[12:56:17] <kuudes> ie by feeding people amphetamines or body temperature raisers they can lose weight, but some percentage of them will die
[12:56:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: "shortening" is a generic baking term for fats of any sort (they make a batter/dough more "short", i.e. soft and crumbly instead of tough and chewy); "vegetable shortening" specifically is a product made by treating certain plant oils (soybean and/or palm) in such a way as to make them have a similar texture to butter at approximately room temperature
[12:56:47] <kuudes> oh, thanks
[12:57:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: This is a representative product: https://crisco.com/product/all-vegetable-shortening/
[12:57:07] <Robomot> All-Vegetable Shortening - Crisco (The original. The classic blue can no pantry should be without. Use it for baking, frying, or just to feel like a rock star in the kitchen.)
[12:57:53] <saturn2> are oreos banned in finland?
[12:58:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Vegetable shortening is cheaper than butter both because it's cheaper to produce - comes from soybean oil or w/e instead of having to raise and milk cows - and also because it is shelf stable at room temperature, i.e. it does not require refrigeration and will not go rancid)
[12:58:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This dramatically reduces shipping and storage costs)
[12:59:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> (That is why very close to all commercial baked goods in the United States use vegetable shortening or vegetable oils instead of butter)
[12:59:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Bakeries, supermarkets, mass-produced baked goods, everything - it's all soybean/palm oil)

[13:01:18] <kuudes> saturn2, I don't think so, I just have never bought them iirc
[13:01:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> They feel the need to say "Not intended for use as a spread" not once but twice
[13:01:35] <saturn2> i see
[13:01:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e. "do not literally spread pure Crisco on your bread and eat it straight up"

[13:02:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Can you imagine doing that? Turns the stomach just thinking about it!)
[13:02:22] <saturn2> ...what happens if you use crisco as a spread?
[13:03:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> By the way, if anyone has ever had a supermarket cake, or one from a cheap (or even not so cheap) American bakery, or like a cupcake - you know those beautiful cupcakes you see on Instagram, with giant piles of frosting, like this https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0IRtlckeLtQ/TvEjySYXy1I/AAAAAAAAAig/DVXLJROa4kk/s1600/Mini+Cupcake+2.JPG

[13:03:11] <saturn2> kuudes: yes
[13:03:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is, literally, Crisco + powdered sugar.
[13:03:25] <kuudes> saturn2, ah, then it is banned in eu presumably?
[13:03:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> You take a massive amount of powdered sugar (i.e. finely ground white sugar mixed with cornstarch) and you beat it into raw Crisco vegetable shortening

This is basically a fancy term for fidgeting. When a person has consumed more calories than they need, their lipostat can boost calorie expenditure by making them fidget, make small movements, and change posture frequently. It’s largely involuntary, and most people aren’t aware that

[14:02:16] <saturn2> there do exist people who are thinner than ideal
[14:03:22] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, I was more curious about whether pie_ wanted to gain muscle, and if so how their experience went
[14:05:50] <Gurkenglas> Some generated images look... "uncanny" in the sense that they throw an exception in the visual cortex. Maybe it's about spatially-local optimization for fitting existing patterns which runs into contradictions on the spatially-global level?
[14:09:39] <Gurkenglas> Remember that woman who lost the ability to even about "left", to the point where if you have her draw a clock the 12 numbers are all on the right side? I viscerally, but not rationally, expect her to experience that when forced to do things involving "left"
[14:16:29] <capisce> people are gradually gaining weight in Japan too, the country with the lowest obesity rate in the world is Vietnam
[14:16:38] <pie_> PapuaHardyNet: I would like to gain a bit, but I havent put a lot of effort into it due to not being very good at managing myself (arguable executive dysfunction, mental health,blah blah idk), so I don't really have much to report.

[23:06:47] <kuudes> ie he has allowed central bank to also make decisions that have "killed" a person from inner circle
