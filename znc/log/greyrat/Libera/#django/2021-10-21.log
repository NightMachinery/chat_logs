[06:46:42] <schinckel> Been thinking about parallel test runs lately - we still get intermittent failures we think are related to shared caches on parallel databases, and I wondered...
[06:47:08] *** Quits: rpkilby (~rpkilby@ec2-34-252-84-235.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:47:20] <schinckel> On "proper" databases, shouldn't we be able to run multiple test runs in parallel with a single database? Why do we need to have multiple databases if we aren't on SQLite?
[06:47:23] *** Joins: rpkilby (~rpkilby@ec2-34-252-84-235.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com)
[06:47:38] <schinckel> I mean, we handle multiple requests in production using a single database and a bunch of workers...
[06:48:57] <PaulWay[w]> A good question.
[06:49:24] <PaulWay[w]> No reason why the unit test system couldn't use a thread per core.
[06:49:56] <PaulWay[w]> Might be complicated if you're testing something that has to do an update, so it locks a table, and that causes another test to update something else in the same table fails.
[06:50:47] <PaulWay[w]> Hard to work out which tests changed the database, and trying to order them so they happened sequentially.
[06:51:37] <PaulWay[w]> I've also had entire test runs fail because of some problem in one test, which somehow caused the fixture loading to fail on every other test.
[06:52:17] <schinckel> Yeah, but pretty much all my tests run in transactions, so at worst it would be a locking thing.
[06:52:55] <PaulWay[w]> I'm not sure of how the locking semantics work there.
[06:55:55] <PaulWay[w]> If thread A is in the middle of an UPDATE operation, and thread B tries to do an UPDATE on the same rows, does B always block?  or does it fail?
[06:56:48] <PaulWay[w]> I agree that theoretically it should work to do them at some level of parallelism.
[06:57:24] <PaulWay[w]> I'm just hedging my bets because simultaneous execution and transactions are both weird.
[06:59:41] <schinckel> Our tests fail we think because of cache conflicts between workers - no amount of twiddling cache prefixes/key mutation functions seems to fix it.
[07:00:26] <schinckel> But then it seems to be worse on machines that are close to hitting their hardware limits - running in `--parallel=2` on a machine with 4 cores does not seem to trigger the errors as much as `--parallel=5` on the same machine.
[07:00:30] <schinckel> Which seems bananas.
[07:00:43] *** Joins: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex)
[07:01:19] <schinckel> ...although the one that I'm looking at now seems to have nothing to do with redis, only in-database, which is isolated so I don't know.
[07:04:34] <schinckel> Would be neat if I could just say "run this same test 100 times"
[07:04:47] <schinckel> Hmm. maybe I can use hypothesis to do that.
[07:04:58] <schinckel> But that won't parallel...
[07:08:04] <PaulWay[w]> I remember a talk at LCA 2007 about a framework that would allow you to run calls in parallel at microsecond leve precision.
[07:08:21] <PaulWay[w]> So it could call some function, and then call another exactly N microseconds later.
[07:08:41] <PaulWay[w]> So they'd step N across a wide range to see if there were any failures in their parallelism logic.
[07:08:50] <PaulWay[w]> But I don't remember what that was and science has probably moved on.

[07:26:31] <schinckel> So, you can dynamically add N copies of a function to a TestCase class, and name them differently, and then you have N versions of the same test class, that you can then run using `--parallel`
[07:26:50] <schinckel> Now, I wonder if I can elicit the same failure case...or if it's coming from a different test for some reason.

[20:06:20] <soxfoxrox> I have a model storing the number of votes for different suggestions every 10 minutes during the day. For each suggestion on each date, I'd like to get the lowest number of votes and the highest number of votes to calculate the number of votes per suggestion per day. I have written a loop that uses 493 database queries to do this, and I can't figure out a way to write an efficient queryset
[20:06:20] <soxfoxrox> for this logic using some sort of aggregation. My latest attempt in getting rid of all the database queries is just to serialize all the suggestions and the votes for each suggestion, but even though I am using prefetch_related on the query, the votes are not part of the serialized data...

[21:12:41] <b-rex> i don't have an answer for that because i've never used google's pub/sub stuff or firebase or whatever
[21:13:27] <yuesbeez> Google is just used to retrieve that json. The database will be a local mysql and no data is sent back to google
[21:13:58] <b-rex> got it.  django can be used for something like that.
