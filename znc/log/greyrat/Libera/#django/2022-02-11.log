[02:35:11] <Shoukrun> Hello! I am wondering how to access thread results and render them on a template.
[02:35:12] <Shoukrun> I have a main view that displays cities and flight prices. The web scraper function that gets the flight prices takes some time so instead of having it in my main view I created a separate function for it. That function runs async when the main view loads however I am wondering how I can pass the prices_list data from my function to the main view
[02:35:12] <Shoukrun> so it's rendered in the template. I'm new to Django and threading so would greatly appreciate any help!

[02:58:37] <PaulWay[w]> Shoukrun: I think you need to think about that as a set of API calls rather than as 'passing something to a template'.
[02:59:23] <PaulWay[w]> HTTP is already an asynchronous interface where each request is independent.

[03:01:47] <Shoukrun> Hm okay I'm not too familiar with the structure of APIs yet. Would I call the get_prices function then retrieve the prices_list variable from it
[03:01:57] <Shoukrun> PaulWay[w]^
[03:02:42] <PaulWay[w]> How familiar are you with the various asynchronous libraries for web page rendering?
[03:02:53] <PaulWay[w]> React, HTMX, there's probably heaps of others.
[03:03:09] <Shoukrun> Not familiar at all to be honest
[03:03:09] *** Quits: dodobrain (~dodobrain@user/dodobrain) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:03:26] <PaulWay[w]> OK.  Then you need to think carefully about how this would work.
[03:03:37] <PaulWay[w]> In the view, basically three things happen.
[03:03:42] *** Joins: dodobrain (~dodobrain@user/dodobrain)
[03:03:56] <PaulWay[w]> You check the request, you gather data, and then you render the template.
[03:04:36] <PaulWay[w]> For a page to have a component that gets data at a later time, that needs to essentially be a separate request.
[03:04:50] <Shoukrun> Yes that makes sense, the trouble I am having is how to execute that logic with the django framework
[03:05:01] <PaulWay[w]> You can either get the page to refresh itself, and each time it reloads it does those three steps and gathers the data it has at the time.
[03:05:24] <Shoukrun> Also my whole structure may be wrong, I currently moved the webscraper function out of the view because it took too long to execute. Was that a smart move or should I have left it in the results view
[03:05:27] <PaulWay[w]> Or you can get parts of the page to request specific pieces of data and (possibly asynchronously) update themselves with that data.
[03:06:28] <PaulWay[w]> For example, HTMX allows you to specify that a particular <div> ID is to be loaded from the content from a specific separate request.
[03:06:38] <Shoukrun> Wow I did not know that
[03:06:50] <PaulWay[w]> The question you need to think about is: where is all the data from the web scraper being stored?
[03:07:25] <Shoukrun> I'm thinking of storing it in a session rather than a database, would that work
[03:08:07] <PaulWay[w]> If it's all within the view variables or context, then (at a basic level) you can't go and do anything else.
[03:08:18] <PaulWay[w]> You have to collect all that data and render the view.
[03:09:11] *** Quits: slav0nic (slav0nic@python.su) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:11:13] <Shoukrun> So if I'm understanding correctly, in my results function I can use HTMX to request data from my get_prices function and then render the template
[03:11:32] <PaulWay[w]> It's a lot more complicated than that.
[03:11:37] <Shoukrun> Would that be faster than just having the get_prices capability in the results view itself
[03:11:38] <PaulWay[w]> So the way it would work is something like this.
[03:11:51] *** Joins: rpkilby (~rpkilby@c-24-20-208-106.hsd1.or.comcast.net)
[03:12:04] <PaulWay[w]> Your main page presents the whole template, with no price information.
[03:12:29] <PaulWay[w]> The template HTML includes the HTMX code, and the price information is in a div with HTMX markup.
[03:12:51] <PaulWay[w]> The div markup is checked by the HTMX code, which makes a separate request to your 'get_prices' URL.
[03:13:27] <PaulWay[w]> The get_prices URL does the web scrape specifically to get prices.

[03:14:06] <Shoukrun> Okay that makes more sense
[03:14:08] <PaulWay[w]> If that was quick it could just return the price data.
[03:14:13] <Shoukrun> Thank you!

[03:14:25] <Shoukrun> I'll have to start reading some HTMX docs
[03:14:26] <PaulWay[w]> If that was slow, it might have to start a process which stores data somewhere.
[03:14:50] <PaulWay[w]> HTMX could then periodically poll that 'get_prices' URL for updates.
[03:15:10] <PaulWay[w]> When it was complete the div would be rewritten to not periodically poll.
[03:15:27] <PaulWay[w]> All this is not going to be easy.
[03:15:37] <PaulWay[w]> I'm only a beginner at HTMX myself.
[03:16:32] <PaulWay[w]> That data could be stored in models, or in something like Memcache or Redis.
[03:16:42] <PaulWay[w]> It cannot be stored in a 'session'.
[03:17:03] <PaulWay[w]> Each request effectively has no idea of where that 'web scrape' process is up to.

The db of this project needs to be in sync with another project (another website) so basically the changes the users made on the first website need to be replicated on the second (replicated in this case does not mean an exact copy of the data) so i cannot create that sync via postgresql.
[15:08:34] <pycode> how do you usually do in a situation like that?
