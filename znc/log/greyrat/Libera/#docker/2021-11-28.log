[01:50:13] <rawtaz> i need help, for once..
[01:50:35] <rawtaz> since the docker documentation is what it is, where can i find the default values for e.g. the options at https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_create/#bridge-driver-options ?
[01:52:02] <rawtaz> i'd also like to know more about he --internal option. the docs say "Restrict external access to the network" which is a super bad and ambigous expanation that doesnt clarify much
[01:52:13] <rawtaz> i hope someone can help me with pointers :)
[01:52:20] <hackers> if you inspect whatever it created would that help?
[01:52:54] <hackers> external access = outside your network
[01:52:57] <rawtaz> (it also says "If you want to create an externally isolated overlay network, you can specify the --internal option" which isnt clearing it up much :)
[01:53:35] <rawtaz> hackers: yes but does that option make it such that external traffic cannot go into the network, or does it make it so that anything on that network cannot reach the outside? i thought it was the latter, you see. but that doesnt really match the documentation
[01:53:57] <rawtaz> im not sure if inspecing would help. maybe.
[01:54:03] <hackers> you cannot reach it from outside, it's pretty clear in my opinion
[01:54:26] <hackers> from what you pasted anyway
[01:54:40] <hackers> I don't have a clear understanding of overlay networks but that part seems clear to me
[01:54:53] <hackers> Nodes in the overlay network can be thought of as being connected by virtual or logical links, each of which corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. For example, distributed systems such as peer-to-peer networks and client–server applications are overlay networks because their nodes run on top of the Internet.{{fact|date=February 2018}
[01:55:28] <rawtaz> yeah but this is for bridged networks
[01:56:06] <hackers> there's never a better answer than finding out by testing yourself
[01:56:13] <hackers> so if you have a question we can test it and find out
[01:56:19] <rawtaz> yeah i should just test it
[01:56:34] <rawtaz> i guess i just got a little tired. i mean the docker documentation REALLY REALLY REALLY sucks
[01:56:37] <hackers> what do you want to test?
[01:56:52] <hackers> it isn't that bad
[01:56:54] <rawtaz> ive been reading a lot of it and it sjust so tiring that they never explain shit even to the level that an idiot would
[01:57:09] <rawtaz> i honestly think it is. im not trying to complain
[01:57:23] <hackers> don't forget it's abstracting rather complex stuff
[01:57:25] <rawtaz> well ill just test the internal setting so i know what it does
[01:57:55] <hackers> so if you don't have a good understanding of the underlying concepts (I'm not claiming I do) it may be hard to understand parts of the documentation about what it actually does
[01:58:36] <hackers> yeah testing is def. the way to go when it's possible
[01:59:31] <rawtaz> i see what you mean, but what im talking about isnt that its a complex underlying thing. im talkiing about super duper low quality aspects, such as documentation missing things that are in the CLI, default values not being documented, syntax not being documented, and foremost explanations of options being very very unclear at times
[02:00:13] <rawtaz> look at this simple example: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#security_opt
[02:00:21] <hackers> yeah show me
[02:00:27] <rawtaz> it makes it look as if the use of that option is to "Override the default labeling scheme for each container"
[02:01:03] <rawtaz> thats not a proper description for that option. what they haev there is an exmaple, and it should then be clear. eg they write "<the missing description of the option here>. For example, you can verride the default labeling scheme for each container: ..."
[02:01:05] <hackers> I bet you id does
[02:01:19] <rawtaz> you bet me it does what? :)
[02:01:42] <hackers> it does what you say it doesn't "override the default labeling scheme"
[02:01:52] <hackers> so if you have the same LABEL in your Dockerfile it will override it
[02:01:59] <rawtaz> i dont remember what it was but there was some option i found in the CLI the other week that wasnt even documented.
[02:02:30] <hackers> don't forget compose just calls existing stuff
[02:02:31] <rawtaz> yes, in that example it does. but thats not what the option is for in general. so they make it sound as if the label stuff is waht you can do with it.
[02:02:48] <hackers> so with that in mind you should be able to find that stuff's documentation :)
[02:03:09] <rawtaz> i know, i totally understand that. but then why do we have the docs if theyre not supposed to be useful
[02:03:20] <rawtaz> im just saying, they are lacking and low quality.
[02:03:27] <rawtaz> if you dont agree, fine
[02:03:45] <hackers> yeah I see what you mean
[02:03:57] <hackers> it's true they could explain what security_opt does
[02:04:00] <hackers> now I see this example: 
[02:04:01] <hackers>     security_opt:
[02:04:01] <hackers>       - seccomp:unconfined
[02:04:33] <rawtaz> i wish they had default values somewhere, im not sure where to find that
[02:04:43] <hackers> but it's really just the docker cli's --security-opt option behind the scene right
[02:04:51] <hackers> doesn't this has documentation? you see what I mean?
[02:04:54] <rawtaz> for example the --internal one, one can assume it's off by default but how can you know if you dont try it :)
[02:05:05] <rawtaz> where did you see that example?
[02:05:35] <hackers> what example?

[02:14:13] <hackers> the best I found to secure containers is distroless 
[02:14:25] <hackers> making distributionless containers
[02:14:28] <rawtaz> OH DUH, now i get what the labeling scheme is in compose context
[02:14:46] <hackers> so if someone hacks your process, he can hardly do anything at all
[02:15:08] <rawtaz> err no, i mistook that for the format compose uses for you rname
[02:15:15] <rawtaz> yeah
[02:15:41] <rawtaz> alpine is a good way towards that, but if you can build your own stuff with just scratch as the "base" then thats surely better
[02:15:47] <rawtaz> and using multistage builds of course
[02:16:17] <hackers> that's a cool one ONBUILD
[02:16:56] <rawtaz> hm im not really finding anything about https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration - do you have any idea what labels theyre talking about? they mention label=type:svirt_apache_t at one point, feels like something similar to selinux or what not

[02:21:54] <rawtaz> the label options listed there
[02:22:03] <rawtaz> those are what i dont understand what labels theyre talking about
[02:23:08] <hackers> it sets labels
[02:23:20] <hackers> like in docker-compose documentation it said it overrides the labels values
[02:23:33] <hackers> so if you set label via security-opt i guess it overrides any label
[02:24:12] <hackers> ah wait
[02:24:20] <hackers> they're selinux labels
[02:24:28] <hackers> hahaha
[02:24:43] <rawtaz> yeah ok, that makes sense, especially with the apache one i mentioned earlier
[02:24:53] <rawtaz> not to complain but ther eyou have a prime example of lacking docs :P
[02:25:00] <hackers> it's not
[02:25:08] <hackers> you don't need to know what you don't need to know 
[02:25:16] <rawtaz> of course it is. why dont thye just write "SELinux labels" instead of "labels"?
[02:25:24] <hackers> it's not the docker project's role to document selinux, apparmor, seccomp
[02:25:31] <rawtaz> that is not what im saying
[02:25:32] <hackers> this is all already documented
[02:25:43] <hackers> if you don't understand something research it
[02:25:46] <rawtaz> im not suggesting that
[02:25:47] <rawtaz> look
[02:25:56] <hackers> you can't find the answer to linux kernel in docker docs
[02:26:12] <rawtaz> i know perfectly well what selinux is, i have used it for years. i know how to find the docs for that, and so on. if you read above i suggested it might have been selinux related
[02:26:15] <hackers> it's an open source project, go make a PR instead of complaining
[02:26:30] <rawtaz> my point is that when the docs just say "labels", theres no knowing if they mean selinux labels or some other type of label - label is a very generic term
[02:26:34] <hackers> https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io
[02:27:12] <rawtaz> them specifying what type of label theyre talking about in the first place is not the same as them documenting selinux - obviously they have to make it clear what theyre referring to if theyre going to refer to something

[03:03:14] <rawtaz> see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#upgrading - they moved the mem_limit et al to the resources: under the deploy:. but at the same time they say that deploy: isnt applicable to docker-compose up.
[03:03:50] <rawtaz> now, since you cannot find mem_limit in any other place in the compose file spec, but in the resources section which is under the deploy section that they say isnt applicable to compose, waht does this mean?
[03:04:18] <rawtaz> does it mean that there's no mem_limit anymore for docker-compose? or does it mean that you can still use it? if so, how/where should you put it?

[03:05:20] <karrq> yeah I have no idea how
[03:05:27] <rawtaz> if you are making a network call that times out, investigate with e.g. tcpdump to see

[03:10:11] <rawtaz> karrq: what does this mean? that the container isnt sending anything out on the net?
[03:10:45] <rawtaz> obviously youll want to perform a pull that works and inspect the network traffic, to know what you are expecting to see. then you try it with the non-working one and compare

[03:21:36] <rawtaz> okay so one cannot restrict resources with version 3 of compose files, because they intended that version to be for swarm/stack. they recommend to stay on version 2.x. the problem is that version 3 introduced some directives that one might need, that are not in version 2.x.

[03:45:10] <rawtaz> if it's just an alpine you might be limited in tooling :(
[03:47:02] <karrq> well I can't determine what packets are the response from within wireshark, but I'm sure I don't see any incoming packets in docker0 
[03:47:10] <karrq> pretty sure it's general networking issue

[03:54:13] <rawtaz> i mean you ahve to establish whats going on, thats the actual isolating of this matter
[03:54:29] <rawtaz> is a proper request going out or not? thats the first thing you want to know. if thats the case and you dont get a reply back you mgiht have routing issues
[03:54:40] <rawtaz> just gotta isolate and verify step by step
[03:55:12] <rawtaz> we had a case the other night here where it turned out someone had a retarded network layout, that was the reason for their 3+ hour docker issues :)
[03:55:21] <karrq> yeah I see the outgoing packets, I thought I specified it ealier
[03:55:48] <karrq> like I see the same requests happening on my eth0 
[03:56:03] <karrq> well not eth0, but enp0s25
[03:57:33] <rawtaz> ok. going out on/towards the internet?
[03:57:43] <rawtaz> whats the source ip of those packets?
[04:01:42] <karrq> same between docker0 and enp0s25: 172.17.0.2
[04:02:39] <rawtaz> i mean; the packets from your apk add command, that you see going out on your docker hosts's ethernet interface (assuming i understood you right), what source address do they have if you look at the actual packets?
[04:04:02] <karrq> yea. those
[04:04:17] <karrq> 0xac 11 00 02
[04:05:53] <rawtaz> what source ip address* ;)
[04:06:07] <cluelessperson> is there a way to prevent docker autocreating a volume?
[04:06:15] <cluelessperson> I have docker images that define like /data
[04:06:24] <cluelessperson> but I want to use a different directory entirely
[04:06:25] <karrq> rawtaz: that's exactly what i'm giving you...
[04:06:32] <cluelessperson> for consistency

[04:07:53] <rawtaz> karrq: hm ok. so im expected to translate that into decimals/base 10 in order to know which "commonly notational" ip address your packets have?
[04:08:11] <karrq> I told you the normal ones and you weren't happy with it so I have you base 16 lol
[04:08:12] <cluelessperson> I'm basically winding up with many anonymous volumes
[04:08:17] <karrq> to show you it's from the actual packets
[04:08:19] <rawtaz> i dont think i ever saw wireshark or tcpdump output not showing the ip address in base 10 notation (even if it does show it in other bases)
[04:08:28] <karrq> bro
[04:08:30] <rawtaz> ah well
[04:08:34] <karrq> xd
[04:09:14] <rawtaz> when you said "same between docker0 and enp0s25: 172.17.0.2" that doesnt make me feel that you are talking about the packets that you see on the outside of your ethernet interface. it sounds like you could be meaning osmething else. thats why i asked for clarification
[04:09:35] <rawtaz> i would be extremely rich if i had a dime for every time someone said something that could be misinterpreted, so i try to always make sure i undeerstand the right thing
[04:10:15] <rawtaz> so, you are saying that when you look at the outgoing traffic on your hosts internet-way-facing ethernet, you see packets going out from 172.17.0.2 - is that correct?
[04:10:22] <karrq> hmmm... let me rephrase it. on docker0 I only see packets going from that IP towards whatever, like 8.8.8.8; I see those same packets in enp0s25... I don't see any other packets in docker0, and I'm not skilled enough to understand what is the reply for the DNS queries
[04:10:28] <karrq> ye
[04:10:29] <rawtaz> also, what is your ip on that ethernet interface?
[04:10:32] <cluelessperson> I suppose I'll create one dummy volume
[04:10:59] <karrq> 192.168.0.101... hmm 
[04:11:15] <rawtaz> right
[04:11:22] <rawtaz> thats your problem then i gues
[04:11:32] <rawtaz> btw are you the one who was here a couple of night ago?
[04:11:37] <karrq> no
[04:11:39] <rawtaz> ok
[04:11:45] <karrq> I never joined #docker in my life before today
[04:12:09] <rawtaz> so, those packets hot your router, right? your router doesnt know where to sent return traffic back to 172.x i presume? so it doesnt.
[04:12:16] <rawtaz> if it even accepts the request packets in the first place
[04:12:24] <rawtaz> btw are you using docker on windows?
[04:12:31] <karrq> no
[04:12:37] <karrq> I'm on arch btw
[04:12:39] <karrq> xd
[04:12:39] <rawtaz> ok
[04:15:29] <rawtaz> hah, seccomp seems nice and friendly.. "If a process in a container accesses denied syscall, it’ll get SIGKILL" :-)
[04:17:27] <karrq> uuuuuh waht. I don't know what I did buuut it's fixed now... somehow. followed this https://serverfault.com/questions/1046544/using-docker-with-firewalld and didn't work, but I added the masquerade rule from the source ip address to the public zone... so maybe that
[04:18:21] <rawtaz> yes, that
[04:18:41] <rawtaz> this makes the traffic originate from your docker host's ip instead of the container's internal ip
[04:19:01] <karrq> very nice
[04:19:35] <rawtaz> what i dont get is why both you and another person had the configuration of this not being the default
[04:19:53] <rawtaz> but i think th eother one too was using arch, so maybe it's something in how docker is set up in arch by default
[04:20:01] <karrq> docker on arch is fine, by default

[05:23:02] <rawtaz> hm just had a discussion with someone who said that a user running as root inside a container effectively has/can gain root powers on the host.
[05:23:25] <rawtaz> ive tried to get a concrete example of how they'd do that from within the container, but they stopped answering.
[05:24:03] <rawtaz> i feel that "am i missing something here? is it really that easy to break out or what to call it? if so, whats a concrete example of that, what do you have to do in the container to get that root power on the host??"
[05:24:22] <rawtaz> ive heard this so many times but i *never* saw a concrete example (besides when the container is misconfigured of course)
[05:24:25] <rawtaz> :/
[05:24:46] <rawtaz> it's causing uncertainty when people say these things but then just go silent when i ask how to do it in practice.

[19:25:53] <BinarySavior> a bind mount allows docker to access host filesystem outside of the docker area, is that correct?
[19:27:31] <ikke> yes
[19:28:15] <BinarySavior> so bind mounts should be used sparingly, right? It seems to defeat the purpose of containerized runtime
[19:29:45] <ikke> I use it to persist production data outside of docker, which is easier to backup and more portable
[19:30:04] <ikke> see the question from node1 above
[19:32:28] <tabakhase> BinarySavior yes&no... - they are mostly the same, but not fully --- mainly a volume keeps what was there, while bindmounts overshaddow everything - in some cases that doesnt make a difference, in others it breaks everything ;-)
[19:33:44] <tabakhase> BinarySavior generally you can say volume are more about persiting data, while bindmounts are more about "shipping in data" - obvs excpetions to both of this exist :D

[21:36:22] <rawtaz> BinarySavior: just dont fuck up, then its fine to use bind mounts :)
[21:37:07] <rawtaz> Piraty: what would i gain from that, you mean? are you saying that there's a concrete example of the case i mentioned in there somewhere along the road?
[21:38:15] <rawtaz> Piraty: just to clarify; i understand the basics. the problem im having is that i hear people saying its so easy to break out of the container. but *noone* ever shows me how it's done, when i ask for a basic simple concrete example of this (in a plain debian install with docker and a basic alpine container, for example). thats the problem
[21:38:27] <rawtaz> if its so simple, then why cant anyone just show me the command(s) needed to do it..

[21:43:49] <rawtaz> yeah. FWIW i thikn its not that simple. i think that most of these people telling me this simply heard that it can be insecure or something, but probably either when there was some specific bug or when one misconfigures things. i thikn the default isnt THAT insecure. but i hope im not wrong heh
[21:44:26] <ikke> You should just keep in mind that your security should not rely on containers giving perfect isolation
[21:44:29] <rawtaz> its funny how all of them go silent the moment i ask "i am totally not questioning what you say, but for purposes of understanding, can you show me how it'd be done in the basic alpine container on a completely vanilla/default debian install?"
[21:44:58] <ikke> Well, many people know that locks are trivially picked, but cannot do it themselves
[21:45:08] <rawtaz> yeah you are right. my feelings are that there will always be more you can do. for example even if you add seccomp you can still add apparmor, and other things

[22:03:11] <dc1> Hi folks. I'm using alpine/git at the top of a dockerfile. I checked the dockerfile for that package and it's used FROM alpine. For some reason my alpine version when building is 3.12 not the latest which is 3.15
[22:03:19] <dc1> is there some kind of recursive pull i need to do here or something?
[22:03:44] <ikke> docker does not pull the image if it's locally available
[22:04:27] <ikke> you can use docker build --pull to make sure it updates images before building
[22:05:10] <dc1> great thank you, i guessed it would be something along those lines
[22:05:33] <DoofusCanadensis> or be specific on your version usage instead of :latest
[22:05:40] <ikke> nod
[22:06:04] <dc1> i am using that syntax for alpine/git but i cant control that dependency's line in their dockerfile :)
[22:06:22] <dc1> I guess this is the part where you tell me you can pin versions and over-ride them?
[22:12:19] <DoofusCanadensis> well, I was thinking on your FROM be specific
[22:12:56] <DoofusCanadensis> keep in mind that FROM line is really just providing you with access to the distro's package manager, not the entire distro
