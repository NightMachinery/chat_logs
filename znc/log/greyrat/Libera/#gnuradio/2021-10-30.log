[00:17:46] <drmpeg> It really comes in handy.
[00:20:55] <drmpeg> I'm not sure I would get enough mileage to justify an expensive one like the Aaronia.

[00:22:40] <drmpeg> It is a beauty.

[00:33:09] <bpadalino> completely different capabilities but less expensive for sure
[00:33:57] <drmpeg> The Rigol 815 seems to be a better deal at $1000.
[00:37:17] <Hash[m]> The realtime aspect of the Aaronia looks amazing for bursty signals along with I doubt I could ever outgrow that tool
[00:38:24] <Hash[m]> but a $1k Rigol likely services all my needs today and the next few years so might be better to high-end shop then

[01:53:27] <willcode4[m]> It's on the max hold on the second one but not the current signal.
[01:54:09] <Hash[m]> Just a matter of when the screen capture hit, it seems to be reduced or jump around when there's other data being transmitted
[01:54:28] <willcode4[m]> And it doesn't show up at all on the spectrogram. But it looks like you might have DC removal turned on there? DC is weaker.
[01:55:06] <willcode4[m]> So, some amount of LO leakage can happen. Is the amount you're seeing going to affect your signal?
[01:55:12] <Hash[m]> I think it's just all so red you don't see if, if I turn down gain a bit on the RX it might show
[01:55:40] <willcode4[m]> That 20dB is in that bin, not over the bandwidth of the signal.
[01:56:41] <Hash[m]> Yea, I have to increase the gain a lot to get my bursts to show up, and when I do that the peak is just massive. It seems to distort things, hard to explain

[02:44:40] <muaddib[m]> Sorry if you‚Äôve already moved past that. I‚Äôm still stuck on the results you got earlier. Maybe I just misunderstood the report.

[02:49:01] <muaddib[m]> Oh ok good. I remember there being some question about the flowgraph causing the spike. Which, while unlikely, should‚Äôve been ruled out with that test.
[03:00:38] <willcode4[m]> The 18:30 images looks like there's quieting going on - some amp is overloaded. The DC spike is disappearing when the burst are transmitted, if I'm reading it right.
[03:01:10] <muaddib[m]> <Hash[m]> "Yes, just a Null Source straight..." <- In case no one answered this, the DC spike will still show up even if you‚Äôre sending zeros. At least my B210 does that. 
[03:01:10] <muaddib[m]> Usually if I need to turn a simple signal signal (like low pass filtered Gaussian noise) on and off, I‚Äôll use a multiply const in between the signal source and the UHD sink, then use the GUI or a Python script sending XMLRPC commands that change the constant to 0 or 1. The radio remains ‚Äútransmitting‚Äù the whole time, which means the DC spike is unfortunately still there. Using the tune command drmpeg mentioned can correct this, but

[03:12:01] <willcode4[m]> Try more attenuation (or distance) and see if that effect goes away. You won't get a good signal if the TX or RX (more likely) amp is saturated.
[03:22:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> LO leakage on TX is inevitable.

[03:37:10] <Hash[m]> <patchvonbraun[m]> "LO leakage on TX is inevitable." <- That seems to be the theme I am hearing, but was surprised just how pronounced it is on the BladeRF, and how it seems to change so much depending on what kind of signal I feed in
[03:38:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> Superhero TX chains typically have the LO far away from the TX frequency. Easier to filter that way.
[03:39:24] <willcode4[m]> TX is one of my favorite superheroes.
[03:40:02] <willcode4[m]> I think the DC is pronounced because your TX and RX are really close together.
[03:43:21] <Hash[m]> Yea, they are super close and I would definitely categorize this in automotive terms as an issue with "the nut behind the wheel" so just trying to figure out where I have a disconnect in expectations and knowledge :) 
[03:44:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> willcode4: autocorrect is a beyotch.
[03:46:06] <willcode4[m]> Yah, you're overdriving something. Try lower powers, more distance, attenuators, some peanut butter, etc.
[03:46:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah even in superhet radios the LO leakage coming out of the mixer is only about -30dBc maybe -40dbc.
[03:46:57] <muaddib[m]> <willcode4[m]> "TX is one of my favorite..." <- If TX is an RF engineer superhero I promise you he‚Äôs under appreciated!
[03:47:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah make sure you are driving the baseband at a magnitude no greater than about 0.88 or so and your TX gain is modest.
[03:48:37] <muaddib[m]> willcode4[m]: Make sure you put on your ESD wrist strap when applying the peanut butter though. I‚Äôve made that mistake one too many times!
[03:53:23] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also start thinking of SDR hardware as a component in an overall RF system design. Rather than ready to hit the streets with just a bit of software.
[03:57:12] <Hash[m]> patchvonbraun: This hit me recently as I started ordering ISM band filters and attenuators and other items I was neglecting 
[03:59:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> Compliance with regulatory stuff and spectral masks and  so on nearly always has you visiting the analog side of the design space.
[04:01:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> A radio that can ‚Äúdo almost anything‚Äù inevitably means that it isn‚Äôt precisely adapted to any particular thing.
[04:08:44] <Hash[m]> One size fits none? :)
[04:10:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> Wouldn‚Äôt go that far. But if you enter the SDR arena thinking there‚Äôs no engineering outside of the SDR necessary you might be disappointed
[04:11:25] <flash[m]> ü§Ø
[04:13:19] <muaddib[m]> So the overwhelming spike in Hash‚Äôs flowgraphs appears to be constructive interference of the DC spike from both TX and RX?
[04:17:04] <patchvonbraun[m]> muaddib: makes sense. There‚Äôll be a DC spike on RX and if the TX also has LO leakage‚Ä¶
[04:23:14] <muaddib[m]> <patchvonbraun[m]> "muaddib: makes sense. There‚Äôll..." <- Right, which makes hindsight 20/20 here. This is a problem that I have actually considered in SDR ‚Äì based experiments I‚Äôve designed in the past. But it never proved to be an issue for my applications. I‚Äôve just never seen it quite this bad before. 
[04:24:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> Offset tuning is your sweeping-under-the-rug friend.
[04:26:32] <muaddib[m]> Yea for sure. That‚Äôs also why so many of the early RTLSDR example flowgraphs Incorporated offset tuning.

[15:39:06] <Hoernchen> it doesn't make the devices bad.
[15:42:51] <Yamakaja[m]> No it doesn't, but why market their products like that :( . You expect a certain degree of professionalism of a company, and selling to tinfoil-hats isn't really helping

[17:19:40] <drmpeg> I guess there's also Siglent and Signal Hound to consider.
[17:22:24] <Hash[m]> I looked at Siglent but kind of wrote them off, seemed like a flashy looking interface but slower. Signal hound I was checking out
[17:24:50] <Hash[m]> My concern trying to analyze and generate bursty signals was to make sure it could visualize it and whether I‚Äôd need something real-time like the RSA/Aaronia or if the DSA series would be fine
[17:26:10] <drmpeg> Yes, that's a special requirement for your smart meter stuff (or any FHSS).
[17:26:59] <Hash[m]> I can see doing more FHSS just based on what I‚Äôve learned so far, so that‚Äôs really me only requirement at this point
[17:27:13] <Hash[m]> s/me/my/
[17:31:06] <Yamakaja[m]> Mhm, FH and bursty low-duty rate signaling is getting you into RTSA territory 
[17:31:53] <Yamakaja[m]> And you're sure an SDR wouldn't do? Think B210
[17:32:19] <Yamakaja[m]> * Think B210 + Fosphor 
[17:33:21] <Hoernchen> yeah..
[17:33:31] <Hash[m]> My concern with using another SDR for measurement and signal analysis is I‚Äôm building the transmitter and building the test gear. I need a control in the mix, my skill level isn‚Äôt high enough to build my test gear to validate my signals
[17:33:31] <Hoernchen> a wideband sdr or signalhound
[17:33:58] <Hoernchen> i suppose as far as measurement equipment is concerned the signalhound is the only "affordable" option
[17:34:20] <Yamakaja[m]> "The Signal Hound USB-SA44B is a Software Defined Receiver (SDR) optimized as a narrow-band real-time RF spectrum analyzer."
[17:34:36] <Yamakaja[m]> From their product description ... so really, you might aswell just with a USRP
[17:35:54] <Yamakaja[m]> Actually, the signalhound can only do IQ streaming up to 240kHz, so it might not be super useful for RTSA-style measurements
[17:36:42] <drmpeg> I agree with Hash. Having an known good calibrated instrument is a big advantage.
[17:37:05] <willcode4[m]> Hash: You might look into the Frequency Xlating FIR Filter. It can change frequencies based on tags. If that works, better than the Delay stuff we were talking about a while ago, and you may be able to hop through all channels that way instead of using the PFB Synthesizer.
[17:37:47] <Hoernchen> Yamakaja[m], lol not the small one
[17:37:51] <Hoernchen> the proper ones
[17:38:11] <Hoernchen> sm200 and so on
[17:38:19] <Yamakaja[m]> You mean the one starting at 13k?
[17:38:39] <Hoernchen> yeah the ones that can compete with measurement equipment starting at 50k
[17:39:24] <Yamakaja[m]> Lol, overkill much?
[17:39:35] <Hoernchen> well emphasis on measuring
[17:39:48] <Yamakaja[m]> Hash: what's your budget?
[17:39:55] <Hoernchen> of course any random  sdr with enough bw will do if you just want to receive signals and demot the iq steam..
[17:40:44] <Yamakaja[m]> Question is also, what do you want to do with your device. An plain old rigol spectrum analyzer wont give you much more than a power spectrum with maybe somewhat accurate absolute power values
[17:40:53] <Yamakaja[m]> s/An/A/
[17:41:16] <Hoernchen> and that is pretty much what any random sdr will not give you
[17:41:39] <Hoernchen> the sh is kinda the only thing that combines both
[17:42:18] <Yamakaja[m]> Question is, does Hash really need accurate power measurements or just information about the signal shape?
[17:42:30] <Yamakaja[m]> I haven't followed this conversation from the beginning ;)
[17:43:00] <Yamakaja[m]> (Shape in time and frequency domain). The swept rigols wont give you time domain information afaik
[17:43:20] <Hash[m]> Budget was around $2500 but flexible, and more concerned with signal shape and quality of signals I am generating. Not really concerned about accurate power measurement
[17:43:25] <drmpeg> IMHO, even a B210 is a sucky receiver.
[17:43:34] <Hoernchen> yeah and if not swept -> gets more expensive by the minute.
[17:44:01] <Hoernchen> also fhss/"uwbe"..
[17:44:02] <Hash[m]> Aaronia looked interesting at around $4k for the real-time aspect and bandwidth
[17:44:10] <drmpeg> Direct conversion is no bueno.
[17:44:37] <Yamakaja[m]> drmpeg: not happy with DC spikes? :D
[17:44:42] <Hoernchen> it's a very flexible and great receiver at that price point (+- blade 2.0)
[17:45:54] <drmpeg> It's not that at all. It's more about images, dynamic range, bandwidth control, etc.
[17:46:30] <drmpeg> False signals in general.

[17:49:31] <Yamakaja[m]> (Just have no idea, i mostly work with direct rf atm)
[17:51:40] <drmpeg> All the transceiver chips (AD9361, Lime stuff) are targeted at wide band applications. The smallest baseband filter is usually huge. It's not a good narrow band RX.
[17:53:30] <drmpeg> Direct sampling is sweet, but it's $$$.
[17:54:05] <drmpeg> Like an X410.
[17:54:42] <Hash[m]> drmpeg: Partially why I started looking used on eBay to see if I could get something high end but a few years old 
[17:56:26] <Yamakaja[m]> So is it the TX or RX where you get all of those issues? To be honest, i have never closely inspected the output of a USRP. (Only the pluto, because it has that nasty square wave lo :D )
[17:56:46] <Yamakaja[m]> Why does a high baseband BW make it a bad RX? Can't you just filter that digitally?
[17:57:19] <Yamakaja[m]> Or are you getting into dynamic range issues from all of the noise you captured aswell?
[17:57:54] <drmpeg> The image still gets through.
[17:58:43] <drmpeg> For dynamic range, I have a 700 MHz LTE node 50 feet away from my house.
[17:59:06] <Macuser> I wish I had one that close
[17:59:13] <Macuser> I live off of 1-2 bar Verizon LTE

[18:00:55] <drmpeg> Here's what it looks like. https://www.w6rz.net/attlte.png
[18:01:49] <Yamakaja[m]> drmpeg: Neat, but when you're looking elsewhere in the spectrum is that an issue? 
[18:02:09] <drmpeg> It's all over the place.
[18:02:37] <Yamakaja[m]> Would an analog frontend band-stop help?
[18:02:52] <drmpeg> I was just gonna say that.
[18:03:04] <Hash[m]> That‚Äôs what I noticed with the B200 and bought some 900MHz ISM band filters, strong signals in other bands appear there as well and jam up my FHSS receiver flowgraph
[18:04:05] <drmpeg> Yeah. if you're targeting a certain band, you can engineer a front end filtering scheme.
[18:04:10] * patchvonbraun[m] mumbles RF systems engineering mumble. No amount of baseband filter can cure IM products generated earlier in the chain.

[18:11:12] <clever> and i noticed, the media i'm watching has a constant peak at around 15.7khz
[18:11:27] <clever> can such artifacts occur from compression codecs?
[18:11:56] <Yamakaja[m]> How large is that peak? Because that's in the audible range, and i'd hope codecs would design around that

[18:12:57] <clever> Yamakaja[m]: its harder to see on the freq one, but very very visible on the waterfall
[18:13:43] <Yamakaja[m]> clever: Have you tried playing audio from different sources? And what is your system audio rate?
[18:14:22] <clever> Yamakaja[m]: gnuradio is capturing at 44.1, the media i'm playing is 48khz, and pulseaudio...
[18:16:26] <clever> plex is feeding the 48khz to pulse intact...
[18:16:49] <clever> and my main sink is also in 48khz mode

[18:18:39] <clever> this screenshot is after changing gnuradio to 48khz as well, so there is no resampling errors
[18:19:12] <clever> but i also notice, the peak is far more constant when music is playing, dialog/voice-only scenes are far less consistent
[18:19:40] <clever> and other media (youtube) doesnt exibit the same peaks
[18:20:51] <clever> Yamakaja[m]: though, a different youtube video, is showing broad spectrum noise, that just has a hard dropoff at the same ~15.9khz
[18:21:21] <Yamakaja[m]> Which screenshot?
[18:21:48] <clever> the first 2 screenshots, are an old tv show

[18:22:38] <Yamakaja[m]> Huh, element isn't showing me those images, but i can see them in IRC??
[18:22:45] <drmpeg> Well, the horizontal rate of NTSC is 15.75 kHz.
[18:22:59] <clever> and this 3rd one is a random youtube video, no constant tone, but a dropoff near it
[18:23:39] <clever> drmpeg: ah, that could be it, the hsync leaking into the old capture hw during the transfer
[18:23:53] <drmpeg> Could be.
[18:24:24] <clever> drmpeg: that show is from 94, so it very well could have been on analog media
[18:25:23] <clever> there are 2 peaks, at 15.4 and 15.75
[18:25:29] <clever> it seems to alternate between them
[18:25:38] <willcode4[m]> I used to be able to hear 15.75 kHz from outside a house. Nice to have flyback transformers in the past.
[18:26:01] <clever> willcode4[m]: yeah, i used to use a 20khz beep for my irc notification noise, just so my dad wouldnt complain about the noise, lol
[18:26:47] <clever> willcode4[m]: but it was so on the border, that it was a bit of a sixth sense, sometimes id think i was hearing it, when it wasnt going off
[18:28:46] <clever> Yamakaja[m]: with that tonegen, i can create a 15.75khz, and still hear it at 15% volume, but the color in the waterfall is far redder then what i see in the show, and 1% is still a stronger peak in the fft
[18:29:31] <Yamakaja[m]> clever: But the peak is gone when you tune it to different frequencies?
[18:30:02] <drmpeg> I can't hear above 11 kHz.
[18:30:50] <clever> Yamakaja[m]: if i tune the tonegen up to 19khz, i can still see it in gnuradio, but cant hear it even at 100%
[18:31:10] <Yamakaja[m]> Ah yes, 19 kHz
[18:31:12] <clever> drmpeg: between 17khz and 18khz is where my ears begin to fail
[18:31:41] <Yamakaja[m]> Lucky you can't hear it, because there's this shit in your local ikea and university library, and it's pretty loud (To the point where you can easily get a headache) https://i.imgur.com/acqX5GK_d.webp?maxwidth=760&fidelity=grand
[18:31:57] <Yamakaja[m]> Any idea what could be producing signals at ~19.9 kHz?

[18:32:21] <Yamakaja[m]> s/your/my/
[18:32:25] <clever> Yamakaja[m]: ive heard that places like that are intentionally creating that tone, as an anti-teenager repellant
[18:32:52] <clever> at least, the ikea thing makes sense
[18:32:59] <clever> dont want them to hang around and bother people
[18:33:04] <Yamakaja[m]> I'd hope our public university libraries aren't trying to repell young adults .-.

[23:14:44] <muaddib[m]> I‚Äôve used both mini-circuits and  primarily. The Lorch filters can be ordered with REALLY tight band edges if you need that. Pricey, but for out of band rejection or specific applications Lorch definitely won the Pepsi challenge (in my experience). 
[23:14:44] <muaddib[m]> I‚Äôve also used bottle and cavity filters for low band stuff, but those are a little hard to put in a backpack :-)
