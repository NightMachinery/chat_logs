[00:36:03] <matsaman> yup
[00:36:14] <FunkyBob> if only they had a solid multi-profile system
[00:36:15] <matsaman> but also does chromium use -webkit-?
[00:36:20] <matsaman> should really be -blink- by now
[00:36:24] <FunkyBob> yes, because it's webkit based
[00:36:34] <matsaman> 'based', what a word =)
[00:36:39] <matsaman> FunkyBob: what's the problem with the profile system?
[00:36:41] <FunkyBob> all derived from KHTML
[00:36:51] <FunkyBob> matsaman: it doesn't fully isolate profiles
[00:36:52] <matsaman> yup, much cred to the Konqs
[00:37:02] <FunkyBob> and it's only recently become accessible, let alone usable
[00:37:06] <matsaman> FunkyBob: oh yeah, that's not very nice OOTB
[00:37:16] <matsaman> super nice for devs, though, obviously
[00:37:21] <matsaman> to get that working
[00:37:23] <FunkyBob> it's the most significant thing keeping me from using FF
[00:37:30] <matsaman> on what OS?
[00:37:36] <matsaman> I seem to recall it was easier on Unixies
[00:37:39] <FunkyBob> Linux, but what does it matter?
[00:37:43] <barkle> how can I make the clipped path corners in this div to have a 'border' ? https://jsfiddle.net/3je8kdzc/
[00:37:54] <matsaman> little easier on dem Unixies, IIRC, yeah
[00:38:00] <matsaman> but I agree it should just work right OOTB
[00:38:25] <FunkyBob> barkle: erk
[00:38:28] <matsaman> barkle: well, you could use the "border slants" hack, but
[00:38:32] <FunkyBob> i've not played with clip-path yet..
[00:38:40] <matsaman> these days you may as well use SVG or something instead probably
[00:38:47] <barkle> or any other easier way to make this
[00:38:54] <matsaman> border slants would be pretty easy, TBH
[00:39:04] <matsaman> and you wouldn't really need the clip-path, either, I don't think
[00:39:27] <barkle> SVG how?
[00:40:27] <matsaman> you could actually make the corner-chopped shape in SVG and include it on the page
[00:40:36] <matsaman> as a background image or regular image, or inline SVG
[00:43:05] <matsaman> or you could use box-shadow, even
[00:43:24] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[00:43:33] <barkle> honestly I would rather not use svg
[00:43:42] <matsaman> yeah =P
[00:43:54] <FunkyBob> it's not so bad, imho
[00:45:46] <MrBech> Wouldn't it make sense for browsers to get rid of -webkit- by now?
[00:45:47] <matsaman> it's the first time that's tedious
[00:45:53] <matsaman> MrBech: no, but
[00:46:02] <matsaman> it would make sense for only webkit-based browsers to be using it
[00:46:12] <matsaman> -whatevs- is
[00:46:21] <matsaman> just a way to implement something that is for testing
[00:46:27] <matsaman> or otherwise proprietary
[00:46:43] <MrBech> But webkit browsers support everything without -webkit- anyways?
[00:46:44] <matsaman> it should always be named after the browser engine that's implementing it
[00:46:54] <matsaman> MrBech: don't think so
[00:47:09] <matsaman> Safari in particular has a lot of proprietary -webkit- stuff
[00:47:22] <MrBech> It's not exactly simple
[00:47:24] <matsaman> that hasn't remotely been pushed for general/other browser implementation
[00:47:28] <matsaman> what's not?
[00:47:33] <MrBech> Having -browser-
[00:47:43] <MrBech> sorry -webkit- etc.
[00:48:06] <matsaman> you're really not meant to use such things outside of testing for future, _standard_ named properties
[00:48:12] <matsaman> doing so is a dangerous abuse
[00:48:34] <MrBech> Not mean to use what?

[05:12:36] <lechner> Hi, in my example from yesterday, is it okay to include a box selecting a tag version as part of the <article>? The text in the yellow box can change with it. Thanks!     https://lintian.debian.org/tags/desktop-entry-uses-reserved-category
[05:12:56] <lechner> this is about document outline
[05:13:31] <matsaman> wha?
[05:14:55] <lechner> trying to serve fewer <div>s
[05:15:42] <matsaman> can you rephrase the question?
[05:16:16] <lechner> is it reasonable to include <nav> elements inside an <article> ?
[05:17:18] <lechner> otherwise, i would be looking for an element between <main> and <article>
[05:18:26] <matsaman> I'm sure you can determine whether it's conceptually reasonable on your own. As for _technically_ reasonable, you can run that by https://validator.nu/ .
[05:18:29] <matsaman> which says nav is allowed as a child of article.
[05:18:42] <matsaman> ie: yes, nav in article, why not
[05:19:04] <matsaman> the only rules are explicitly stated in the spec
[05:19:25] <matsaman> and as previously stated, hardly anything really is going to successfully consume these meaningful elements in any way that you will care about
[05:19:37] <matsaman> the primary issue has always been whether the page makes sense to user agents if CSS is not provided
[05:19:45] <matsaman> or if it instead looks like a pile of trash
[05:20:10] <matsaman> my guess is a text only browser will not fudge nav in an article
[05:20:21] <matsaman> but even if it did, it still wouldn't really matter

[11:51:03] <undefined_bob> hm the CSS rule which affects my p is called 'p, figcaption, ul.sqrlist' and I added 'p:not(.no-p-flag)' and for testing 'p, figcaption, ul.sqrlist:not(.no-p-flag2)' and added both classes to my special p but it is still affected by that rule
[11:56:39] <pavonia> Note that :not applies only to one of the comma-separated selectors, not all

[12:02:50] <undefined_bob> thank you
[12:02:51] <pavonia> You usually add a p-flag class to only the elements that should have a special style and define that in a separate rule
[12:03:47] <undefined_bob> maybe its easier if I just use for example a <span> instead of the <p> to avoid this trouble

[12:15:34] <undefined_bob> just tested it, seems to work with the <span> so far

[22:15:41] <pavonia> *works
[22:22:33] <pavonia> Ah interesting, it works by interpreting several characters as a ligature and replacing them by a single glyph
[22:23:44] <pavonia> Like 'f' followed by 'i' is often replaced by 'ﬁ'

[23:45:11] <ash_m> Suppose you are tasked to animate a hinge, for example something in the shape of a `V` into the shape and position of an `L`. These shapes may be anything, svg lines, divs, whatever. How would you go about animating them? Would you use GSAP? CSS animations? SVG animations? Something else? The use case is not much more complex than this example.
