[02:55:57] <^-^hi> what do you think about deriving a key from a password (with multiple times of key stretching with argon2 and salting each round with a long but fixed salt ) , then encrypting website names (plus padding) with the key, then using that as password?
[02:59:10] <^-^hi> so you only keep one strong password in your brain. you don't need to keep encrypted passwords like in a password manager, where if you lose the file you lose all the passwords.
[02:59:49] <snappy> what happens if a website is compromised as your password data is leaked?
[03:00:42] <^-^hi> one thing is that your (deriven) password is gonna be something like 60-char long base64 thing.
[03:01:07] <^-^hi> if hackers get the hashes, they will have a much harder time to get that password.
[03:01:18] <snappy> https://tonyarcieri.com/4-fatal-flaws-in-deterministic-password-managers
[03:01:27] <^-^hi> and if they do, they only get the password for that particular website
[03:01:58] <^-^hi> if the cipher is not prone to known-plaintext
[03:02:27] *** Quits: drathir_tor (~drathir@wireguard/tunneler/drathir) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:04:51] <piou> sure, but what do *you* do? Surely you'll need to change it, but by what? Now you're starting to keep a list of changed passwords for possibly compromised websites alongside your method that is designed to avoid having to keep a list
[03:05:49] <^-^hi> problem 1 in that website can be fixed by only sticking to small letters and numbers. if some website requires symbols and capitals, you add !A to the password
[03:06:27] <piou> And if it requires a shorter password you shorten it etc... And now you must remember what to modify for what website...
[03:06:54] <^-^hi> almost no website ever requires shorter passwords
[03:07:06] <piou> sadly, too many do
[03:07:31] <piou> I've seen websites that only allow passwords between 8 and 12 characters, and symbols, and digits but only if they're not at the beginning or the end of the password
[03:07:49] <^-^hi> some ban big letters, because many people don't know what is CapsLock
[03:07:55] <^-^hi> piou: when?
[03:08:16] <piou> I won't say which because it would be a disservice to my employer, but it's currently in use
[03:08:51] <piou> And yes, it's a shame
[03:09:04] <piou> Still, websites with weird requirements exist
[03:09:24] <^-^hi> well that website is going to be weaker than your password
[03:09:45] <piou> maybe, maybe not, but that's entirely beside the point
[03:10:14] <piou> Either you can decide not to use it, and may decide not to use it, or you must use it.
[03:11:40] <^-^hi> for such a website the best idea would be just going with a weak password because:
[03:11:48] <^-^hi> 1) idiots maintain it
[03:12:12] <piou> You're missing the point
[03:12:23] <^-^hi> 2) it probably doesn't store hashes, why would one worry about a longer than usual
[03:12:30] <^-^hi> password
[03:12:57] <piou> Most websites I've read that have a higher limit actually do store hashes

[03:13:52] <piou> But that's beside the point
[03:13:59] <^-^hi> ok the method in my head involves selecting a piece of text, so it goes to PRIMARY (we would deal with windows and whatever somehow i don't know)
[03:14:33] <^-^hi> then pressing a key combination, so the daemon takes the text, encrypts and autotypes it.

[03:15:16] <^-^hi> the original text could presumably be a website address or anything.
[03:16:19] <^-^hi> maybe we can have modifiers in the selected text that mandate the format of output
[03:17:12] <^-^hi> if it ends with . (handy with selecting URLs) it would contain symbols and big letters
[03:17:47] <piou> cutting off the end of the domain just to end on a dot sounds risky
[03:18:14] <^-^hi> maybe if it starts with / or something it could conform to another format.
[03:18:27] <piou> not risky in a dangerous way, but in a "hey, I already used that half-domain" kind of way
[03:18:52] <^-^hi> of course you can always type your thing and select it
[03:19:00] <piou> So now you need to remember for any website what to copy to
[03:19:41] <piou> And you still haven't resolved the issue of changing passwords after possible compromission, although I guess you'd decide to select something else from the url or page (which could change)
[03:20:06] <piou> Frankly that quickly amounts to a lot of memorization in order to use a tool to avoid memorization
[03:20:46] <piou> I fail to see the advantage over regular memorization-free password managers that keep a list of generated passwords
[03:21:13] <^-^hi> that is not to avoid memorization in its entirety. and not memorizing is not the only point. 
[03:21:36] <piou> Isn't it kind of an important point?
[03:22:28] <piou> Anyway, gotta go.
[03:22:49] <^-^hi> i and people i know can comfortably memorize something like 4-3 passwords at least. if we forget it we try some similar thing we think maybe the password
[03:23:23] <^-^hi> for example reddit gets hacked, your password gets leaked. no worries. you will try reddit2 reddit3 reddit4
[03:23:45] <^-^hi> or //reddit or whatever
[03:24:52] <^-^hi> and memorization is not the main issue, the issue is that many people use similar passwords for more than one website
[03:25:27] <^-^hi> and even if they don't, getting one of the passwords in plaintext could lead to clues about how they choose passwords still.

[03:33:17] <Platonides> just use a "normal" password manager
[03:33:52] <Platonides> you probably still need to memorize 3-4 passwords anyway:
[03:33:58] <Platonides> - Hard disk encryption
[03:34:06] <Platonides> - OS account
[03:34:11] <Platonides> - Password manager
[03:34:19] <^-^hi> Platonides, what if you lose the backup.
[03:34:41] <Platonides> you create another backup from the original :)
[03:35:05] <Platonides> you should likely have more than one backup
[03:35:20] <^-^hi> no i mean your passwords will be encrypted in one big thingie, you will lose that.
[03:35:39] <Platonides> well, yes "don't lose that"
[03:35:52] <Platonides> if you can have several backups
[03:35:56] <^-^hi> i just lost 2 device storages in a week
[03:36:02] <Platonides> ouch
[03:36:15] <^-^hi> imagine you live in india or europe or anywhere outside sahara
[03:36:20] <^-^hi> some flood comes
[03:37:02] <^-^hi> your baggage get wet or goes with water or something
[03:37:44] <^-^hi> things happen. some are lucky, but i don't want to lose my devices (it wasn't due to flood in my case, it was sheer bad luck)
[03:38:01] <^-^hi> my data*
[03:38:22] <Platonides> I was going to suggest a physical book as password manager
[03:38:35] <Platonides> that would help with many hardware problems
[03:38:44] <Platonides> but not with a flood
[03:38:47] <^-^hi> any encryption practical with that would be trivial to break
[03:39:15] <Platonides> yes
[03:39:18] <Platonides> it depends on your threat model
[03:39:40] <^-^hi> also if you make many backups, it would easier to be stolen
[03:39:54] <Platonides> if your home is secure, that's not a bad way
[03:40:01] <Platonides> and it's easy to understand to Aunt Tillie
[03:40:24] <Platonides> for a catastrophic issue like you mention
[03:40:45] <Platonides> one should probably store the encrypted password db in some online service
[03:40:59] <Platonides> DropBox, OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.
[03:40:59] <^-^hi> also not many people hold that many devices and have enough time to sync all their backups for new passwords.
[03:41:23] <Platonides> you don't neccessarily update the backups daily
[03:41:29] <^-^hi> if your encrypted thing gets leaked, then it is just as secure as your password
[03:41:48] <^-^hi> as the master password
[03:41:53] <Platonides> suppose you do that once a week, would you remember how many sites you signed up / changed passwords in the last week? Probably
[03:41:58] <Platonides> indeed
[03:42:18] <Platonides> you could further encrypt it with another password
[03:42:22] <Platonides> or key
[03:42:27] <Platonides> but that's the same
[03:42:38] <Platonides> if you lose your backup key in the flood...
[03:42:46] <^-^hi> which someone can overlook from a keyboard, easily see from some camera or something. if they don't just guess it.
[03:43:14] <^-^hi> but in my system none of those are a threat look:
[03:44:25] <^-^hi> you choose a master password and a pad. the pad could be anything. it gets stored in plaintext. it is just chosen so if someone sees you typing the master password, they won't have access to your websites.
[03:44:43] <^-^hi> the master password is your typical strong password.
[03:45:10] <^-^hi> and the rest is easy. select URL or part of it, encrypt it and there you go.

[04:03:18] <Platonides> and now, it is asking you for your Maiden name, what did you fill there? hmm
[04:04:04] <^-^hi> the good thing is that it could encrypt everything.
[04:04:19] <^-^hi> usernames, childhood questions etc.
[04:04:32] <^-^hi> you enter maiden, select, encrypt, enter.
[04:05:17] <Platonides> good for you if it works
[04:05:31] <Platonides> I still thinkg that one which actually stores the data is safer
[04:06:27] <^-^hi> you can do trial and error all the times, and it could cause little annoyance in some hypothetical strange websites.
[04:06:43] <^-^hi> but, you would never lose stuff.
[04:07:07] <^-^hi> since you only need to remember two things, and you carry your brain all the time.
[04:07:11] <Platonides> given enough tries, you will probably be able to find the combination
[04:08:15] <Platonides> still, having to test it everytime will probably end up being quite annoying
[04:08:24] <Platonides> although you could combine both approaches
[04:08:43] <Platonides> saving passwords generated that way into a classic password manager
[04:08:56] <^-^hi> you won't have to test it everytime.
[04:09:09] <^-^hi> in most of websites you just copy the url
[04:09:46] <^-^hi> in a very small fraction of them you copy some of the url just ending it in '.'
[04:10:06] <^-^hi> and you probably remember that. even if you don't, it is 2 tries.
[04:11:35] <^-^hi> and for example if "google.com" gets compromised, you just use "oogle." instead of "google." now. 3 tries if you forget even that.
[04:11:42] <^-^hi> and all that happens
[04:12:22] <ms7821> just use a normal password manager
[04:12:52] <^-^hi> would you read the chat so you see the problems i cited with that?

[04:20:02] <ms7821> all password managers help you keep backups though
[04:21:53] <^-^hi> imagine flood comes in your home. your house burns. your sd card fails out of sheer bad luck. you would also lose the data on them, and additionally access to your everything if you used those password managers. 
[04:22:24] * ^-^hi lost 1 usb stick, 2 sd cards, 1 ssd in a month or so.
[04:22:37] <sarnold> ouch
[04:22:39] <ms7821> store it online, it's encrypted
[04:22:58] <^-^hi> then they would only have to guess the master password.
[04:23:00] <snappy>  yeah i don't know what hte problem is, 1password syncs my password database to their servers
[04:24:35] <Platonides> a yubikey is supposed to be sturdy enough
[04:24:55] <Platonides> you could probably encrypt your database with a private key stored in the yubikey
[04:25:10] <Platonides> which you could wear yourself
[04:25:46] <^-^hi> yeah but in my way you need none of those.
[04:25:47] <Platonides> however, that might be a problem if while your house burns you get kidnapped and end up nude with no home
[04:25:51] <ms7821> ^-^hi, under what threat model can someone guess a 4-word master password?
[04:26:09] <ms7821> because all the ones I can think of also break your deterministic scheme
[04:26:22] <^-^hi> someone knowing you, someone planting one of those cheap cameras somewhere you'd enter it.
[04:26:36] <^-^hi> someone knowing what kinds of passwords you'd make.
[04:26:39] <ms7821> OK, so suppose they do that to *you* and see you typing in your master password
[04:27:57] <Platonides> that would give them access to all your passwords, past and future, in one go
[04:28:04] <ms7821> they don't even need to get hold of your encrypted password store
[04:28:12] <Platonides> *without* needing to also steal your password database
[04:28:27] <Platonides> yep, we were writing the same :P
[04:28:31] <ms7821> heh
[04:28:51] <^-^hi> the "pad" i mentioned protects against that without a password database.
[04:29:09] <^-^hi> also, online services aren't online all the time.
[04:29:53] <Platonides> then you probably don't need your website passwords at that moment xD
[04:30:01] <ms7821> so hang on, you're replacing a password database with a file containing random data
[04:30:05] <ms7821> what happens if you lose that random data file?
[04:30:17] <^-^hi> imagine it goes down for some days, or your government blocks access to websites outside the country or something.
[04:30:24] <ms7821> (e.g. a flood comes in your home. your house burns. your sd card fails out of sheer bad luck)
[04:32:31] <^-^hi> the first happened with google and facebook so could as well happen for your cloud store
[04:32:31] <^-^hi> the second happened recently with iran and cuba
[04:32:31] <^-^hi> ms7821, that is not random. that is one simple thing you type once and store it there in plaintext.
[04:32:32] <^-^hi> to protect against overseers.
[04:33:00] <^-^hi> and my approach only takes remembering 2 damn passwords.
[04:33:08] <^-^hi> and protects against all that.
[04:33:15] <ms7821> OK, so it's not a pad it's a second half of the master password

[04:47:30] <Alipha> Nice thing about password managers is that they also store your username
[04:47:53] <^-^hi> hmm... you could also generate those as well.

[04:57:56] <Platonides> in your scheme, suppose your master password was compromised

[05:00:45] <ms7821> OK, then I'll answer human fallibility to your question
[05:01:19] <ms7821> the point is thinking about the scenario where your master password is compromised (however that happens)
[05:01:26] <Platonides> there was someone around when you had to log in into "unimportant website" from a computer on their sight
[05:01:40] <Platonides> now, what do you do?
[05:01:50] <Platonides> will you do something after that, or ignore it=
[05:01:51] <Platonides> ?
[05:02:28] <^-^hi> they would see nothing. they would only see me selecting something, and doing a key combination and the password field getting filled.
[05:02:45] <Platonides> they also saw you logging in
[05:02:55] <Platonides> plus, that may not be your computer
[05:02:59] <Platonides> but that plan9 one :)
[05:03:30] <^-^hi> the traditional password managers also need to operate on a trusted computer.
[05:04:26] <ms7821> we're not saying password managers are immune to master password compromise
[05:04:30] <^-^hi> and the threat of someone recording me typing a password is different from someone seeing me login to somethings.
[05:04:42] <^-^hi> something(
[05:04:46] <^-^hi> damn
[05:04:48] <^-^hi> something*
[05:05:24] <ms7821> I dunno what Platonides is gonna say but I'm saying your system is also not immune, and probably worse, and most password managers help you rotate your passwords when that happens
[05:05:50] <^-^hi> you know what it takes to rotate a password in my case?
[05:06:03] <^-^hi> just change the master password.
[05:06:27] <^-^hi> if you want to change one of the output passwords only, add a number to the thing you copy

[05:08:15] <^-^hi> ah, i get the point. changing the master password without changing the output.
[05:08:21] <Platonides> if someone might have seen your master password, you could change it
[05:08:42] <ms7821> but you're also not gonna "just change the master password" because that means logging into all 200+ websites you used this system for and changing the resulting password there
[05:09:04] <Platonides> *and* you need to remember that list of 200+ websites to begin with
[05:09:23] <Platonides> which a stateful password manager would help with
[05:09:45] <^-^hi> yes, THAT (the person having both access to your storage to see the pad, and being able to see the master password as well) would be a threat.
[05:09:48] <sarnold> if you can't remember it, do you really need to log in there again? :)
[05:10:23] <ms7821> well let's pick up the earlier question of whether you'd rotate your master password when someone only got half of it
[05:10:37] <^-^hi> but if they have both in case of a stateful password manager, they will already have your everything. the difference is existent, but marginal.
[05:10:59] <^-^hi> on the other hand, you don't lose anything to any accident ever.
[05:11:11] <^-^hi> and the difference is marginal.
[05:11:13] <ms7821> you're pretending that a stateful password manager doesn't have multiple keys
[05:11:55] <ms7821> (1password for example requires a separate secret key)
[05:12:37] <^-^hi> well, one key two keys three keys, that could apply to my idea as well.
[05:13:18] <ms7821> I mean sure, if you change your idea to basically be everything a typical password manager is, but with a dumb password generation system, then yes
[05:13:36] <ms7821> everything could apply to your idea
[05:14:29] <ms7821> though it's probably easier to retrofit the dumb password generation system onto an open source password manager than start from scratch
[05:15:22] <^-^hi> you could have many keys if you want, run two daemons with different key combinations. or maybe keep more than one pad and use them in the same daemon.
[05:15:45] <ms7821> and you could store maybe a key per password
[05:15:59] <ms7821> and then encrypt those keys with your master password and the master secret key, and store it all in the cloud
[05:16:23] <ms7821> and not worry about floods or fires again
[05:16:25] <^-^hi> that would be very different from my idea, and i was just saying that is possible

[22:09:13] <tusko> I need some help with my logic
[22:09:49] <riv> ask away
[22:10:05] <tusko> Say we have a 16-bit key, thats 2^16 possible keys. If an attacker could check 100 keys per second they could check every key in 655.36s.
[22:10:53] <tusko> But how to think about the expected value for cracking this? I want to say it would be half that time but I can't say exactly why other than an inclination that 50-50 is involved.
[22:11:03] <tusko> Essentially they're just randomly guessing keys.
[22:11:18] <tusko> I have more than a little doubt about that expectation.
[22:11:45] <yawkat> half the time is one bit of difference which doesnt really matter
[22:12:20] <riv> you can think of it this way. The cracking checks key0, key1, key2, ..., key2^16 in that order
[22:12:41] <riv> and the actual key you are looking for is keyn for some random n uniformly chosen
[22:13:00] <riv> so your guess that the expectation is 50% is correct
[22:13:46] <riv> hmm.. i have a fence post error, subtract -1 from 2^16
[22:14:53] <riv> E[X] = sum x_i p_i,  if we have n keys, x_i = i, p_i = 1/n . E[X] = 1/n (sum_[i = 0 to n-1] i)
[22:16:03] <int-e> riv: more fenceposts... testing key0 takes 1 try.
[22:16:15] <riv> oh nasty! thanks for that correction
[22:16:50] <tusko> What's a fencepost? Can it tell me how to trade stonks?
[22:16:52] <tusko> :)
[22:18:01] <int-e> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencepost_error
[22:18:30] <tusko> I guess that makes sense that it would be 50%, just having a tough time visualizing it. Your E[x] = 1/n sum_[i=0 to n] i makes sense tho.
[22:21:20] <riv> for 3 keys, 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111  circle a random one of those. where do you expect it to be in the list?
[22:21:30] <riv> 3 bits*
[22:21:51] <aczid> you can view it as a normal distribution where the outliers on either side (first or last keys tried) have the lowest chance, and the bump in the middle has most of the keys in the space
[22:23:01] <aczid> I guess you should be thinking in terms of worst/best/average running time
[22:23:05] <yawkat> i doubt it's normal
[22:24:03] <riv> aczid, are you sure? that sounds wrong to me
[22:24:26] <riv> i was thinking more that 000 and 111 are equally likely, 001 and 110 are equally likely, and so on
[22:24:34] <aczid> I'm not sure, but that's more or less how I think about it :)
[22:24:43] <riv> each of those pairs averages to the middle, so you if you avg them all you stay right in the middle

[22:26:51] <TimMc> I don't think normal distributions are relevant here.
[22:28:08] <tusko> Since they're bruteforcing it I might assume the CDF is linearly increasing to 1 with the number of keys tested. So, once half the keys are tested we would have 50% of the area under the curve accounted for.
[22:28:56] <riv> I think you're inverting the situation now
[22:29:10] <riv> you're talking about the likelyhood of a crack given that we've checked 50% of keys
[22:30:45] <tusko> Yeah, maybe. I am just interested in the expectation. Which should be E[x] = E1P1 + E2P2 + ... + EnPn for events Ei with probability Pi, as you suggested.
[22:31:45] <TimMc> Expected time is half.
[22:32:22] <tusko> Right, because each guess is equiprobable to be the right guess.
[22:32:28] <TimMc> yep

[22:35:34] <riv> ah nice link
[22:36:12] <riv> haha
[22:36:19] <riv> you can save one comparison by not checking the final key
[22:37:04] <int-e> but you're looking for a key... you'll presumably want to decrypt anyway ;)
[22:37:26] <aczid> it's still a linear search no matter how the comparison operation works
[22:40:39] <TimMc> Why n+1?
[22:42:17] <TimMc> ...never mind, I've decided I don't care about a constant factor :-P
[22:43:22] <riv> it's 1/n * T(n) where T(n) = n(n+1)/2
[22:43:28] <riv> T(n) = 1 + 2 + .. + n
[22:44:07] <riv> so if we have 3 keys it's expecting 2 tries, if we have 4 keys it's expecting 2.5 tries
