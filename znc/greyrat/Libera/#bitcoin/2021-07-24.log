[03:19:44] <harding> robertspigler: well, blockfilterindex=1 requires extra space (I think currently about 5 GB, plus about 1 GB per year).  Obviously, it also implies extra upload bandwidth.  Some people have argued that it makes lightweight wallets more appealing to develop, although IMO people seem plenty willing to develop lite wallets all on their own.
[03:21:37] <harding> robertspigler: I'm not aware of any plans to make it a default; I think if you could show lots of people running it on an opt-in basis, that would move forward the idea of making it a default.  Also, I think maybe it could be a semi-default implied by the way people chose other options, e.g. 5 GB extra data seems fine for non-pruned nodes, but if people choose pruned, you'd turn it off.

[03:54:56] <robertspigler> harding: Isn't that Compact Block Filters / BIP 158 / `peerblockfilters=1` ?  I was talking about compact block relay / BIP 152 / `blockfilterindex=1`
[03:55:12] <robertspigler> I understand with and agree with the reasoning behind non-default for BIP 158
[03:56:04] <harding> robertspigler: blockfilterindex=1 is BIP158, peerblockfilters is BIP157, compact block filters are BIP152.
[03:56:05] <robertspigler> I guess the extra space/bandwidth argument still applies, but I don't think the light wallet does?
[03:56:32] <robertspigler> Oh, thanks for the correction
[03:56:42] <harding> compact block filters are already the default in Bitcoin Core for years, most peers using low bandwidth mode and up to three peers using high bandwidth mode.

[16:25:15] <paulo_> hi
[16:27:53] <paulo_> can I receive an LN payment without an on chain txn?
[16:29:28] *** Quits: carlos (~pum@user/carlos) (Remote host closed the connection)
[16:37:05] <AndyS2_> paulo_: some LN wallet providers can insta-create a channel if you create a ln invoice through them
[16:37:21] <AndyS2_> paulo_: muun wallet might even front the cost of channel creation even for minor ln invoices
[16:37:31] <AndyS2_> but I haven't tested that
[16:38:37] <caveman> are there countries where banks ban bitcoin exchanges from getting money, or returning money?
[16:39:36] <AndyS2_> paulo_: https://phoenix.acinq.co/faq#what-are-the-fees - you need to at least receive 10,000 sats, minium fee is 3,000 sats (or 1% of sent bitcoin, whichever is higher)
[16:40:25] <AndyS2_> I think that first receive is not trustless, not entirely sure, though. after that you hold the keys to the bitcoin of the lightning channel that was created, though, so it's non custodial
[16:41:34] <AndyS2_> I think muun is similar, minus the up-front fee. they probably have higher LN fees when you actually use the channel. IIRC phoenix and muun do not allow you to create channels with other people yourself, you only have channels with them (which is trustless, but they could theoretically censor you, for example)
[16:41:44] <paulo_> amazing, thanks
[16:43:16] <AndyS2_> If you object to having a few dollars of Bitcoin in such a wallet, you can probably pay someone to create a channel with you over lightning in a different wallet. so you solve the onboarding issue ("How do I receive my first few Satoshi?") and then, once you have a few dollars worth there, you pay for an LN channel to you self-hosted LN wallet/node :)
[16:44:41] <AndyS2_> I personally like the option of having a custodial LN wallet. as invoices aren't that private it might even be a good idea to receive smaller payments through them and then move the funds, but I'm not 100% sure about that
[16:45:11] <AndyS2_> (If you trust the custodian to not sell/lose that payment info)
[16:46:58] <AndyS2_> and of course the non-custodial but potentially censorable and potentially trust requiring (if channels don't suffice) wallets are better than custodial ones without any downsides compared to full custodial ones (besides potentially slightly higher fees)
[16:48:38] <AndyS2_> Would be nice if custodial solutions like Strike offered the option to create channels like phoenix so part of the funds are more safu (as long as you keep your keys secure) if you want them to be.
[16:52:37] <paulo_> i now have a phoenix wallet...
[16:52:40] <paulo_> how do I fund ut
[16:52:42] <paulo_> *it
[16:54:41] <AndyS2_> Press "receive" on the bottom, press the fourth symbol from the left (square with pen) and enter an amount >10,000 sats, press "Create invoice". You will receive 7,000 sats if someone/you pays that invoice I guess
[16:55:58] <AndyS2_> the 3000 sats they keep are about $1 and they use that for the L1 transaction and other costs they have (like locking up BTC in that channel that they own so you can receive more. not sure how large the channels are they create)
[16:57:38] <paulo_> cool, is there a website I can buy sats using my credit card
[16:57:49] <paulo_> and send them directly to my LN?
[16:58:27] <AndyS2_> I don't know which exchanges support LN
[17:00:02] <paulo_> theres an on-chain address on the receive section
[17:00:23] <paulo_> If I send sats to that address, will it fund my LN channel?
[17:00:48] <AndyS2_> https://phoenix.acinq.co/faq#i-just-sent-an-on-chain-transaction-to-phoenix-how-long-does-it-take-before-i-can-use-it
[17:01:14] <AndyS2_> the FAQ is really thorough and it is a good idea to read it all to get a feel for what they are trying do to with their wallet variant :)
[17:06:49] <paulo_> well that sucks, my local exchange doesnt support this format: bc1qk03u6k8hna5ggfmeqtwxnen6gxmlml2zkyzpk5
[17:07:03] <paulo_> that's a segwit address, right?
[17:07:49] <s17> native segwit (bech32)
[17:08:17] <AndyS2_> Yup. LN requires segwit because of transaction malleability IIRC
[17:11:08] <belcher> paulo_ i suggest sending your exchange a message asking them
[17:11:19] <belcher> is that exchange on here? https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption

[17:56:14] <AndyS2_> so short answer: yes. one of the outputs in the Commitment 1a (or 1b) is more complicated. it can be spent by the "normal" owner after waiting for some on-chain blocks have passed OR by the channel partner (which also owns the second output) if the channel partner knows the breach remedy transaction
[17:56:56] <AndyS2_> that breach remedy stuff is only known by the channel partner if a new commitment has been agreed upon
[17:58:36] <AndyS2_> as you can see on this page there's lots of transactions that are only known to either party, but e.g. Commitment 1a and 1b agree upon the same amount of satoshi for Alice and Bob
