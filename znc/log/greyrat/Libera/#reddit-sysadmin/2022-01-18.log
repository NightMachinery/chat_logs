[00:18:53] <PublicWiFi> my plumber charges like 60 bucks an hour or something
[00:19:11] <vinrock> learning carpentry tho you kinda get a basic understanding of everything, its not woodworking its the whole contruction concept

[05:00:16] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Studies show that theres a specific region within the eyes of a male fly called the love spot. It is pretty much used for detecting and chasing female flies. This spot is located within the dorsofrontal region of their eyes. This is typically used to detect small target motion, however, males also use it to stay locked onto potential mates during aerial pursuit.

[05:00:58] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies like to eat manure, which is animal poop, or old garbage. Some of the germs from these materials can stay on their feet or mouth parts. When a fly lands on your food, those germs get on your food. Super disgusting!

[05:01:17] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies defecate… a lot! And they aren’t too worried about where they do it either! As you know, house flies like to live off a liquid diet. Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if it’s on their next meal!

[05:08:15] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Like butterflies, flies can taste food using their feet! This is all down to taste receptors (chemonsensilla) being located on their lower legs and feet. When a fly lands on a tasty meal, which can be anything from animal feces to your lunch, they will often wander around to give their next meal a good taste before consuming it.

[05:34:12] <sd> 02<v​aportrail> well, at the end of the day, all it takes (in theory) is time to virtualize, and you get a snapshottable copy pasteable computer that you dont have to worry about failing (kind of), whereas if you just make a physical backup machine, you have to go on site to replace if there are failures, and it wont be kept up to date with the live device. the device i cloned was literally an HVAC system, so the only changes would be temperature and fan speed
[05:35:55] <sd> 02<v​aportrail> frankly, it would have been better for me to virtualize mine, but i just couldnt figure it out and was tired of dicking around with windows xp, and the system will be replaced in the next handful of years anyway, so my 3 backup solutions i judged are enough (i swapped the current machine from hdd to ssd, i have a full image of the machine and a tested recovery method, and an entire physical spare)
[05:36:02] <AdmiralNines> is it just me or was that a little out of the blue? do we only get some of the comments from discord?

[05:41:22] <sd> 02<v​aportrail> and i would argue that its a better platform than irc simply because of the lower skill barrier of entry, not that irc is hard, but to some 13 year old who thinks computers are neat would likely have an easier time clicking "join server" and discording than ircing

[06:00:04] <csws> if I wash it, it'll just get dirty again
[06:00:07] <AdmiralNines> I just saw a study saying that if you shower more than 3 times a week that you're more likely to get corona.
[06:00:24] <AdmiralNines> because it washes away the good bacteria that fights the bad ones. or something.
[06:00:29] <AdmiralNines> It was on reddit so i know it's true.

[08:36:04] <misspwn> didn't get covid then, got it from my hair stylist who's client lied
[08:36:44] <misspwn> so do we manage it by daily testing or what?
[08:36:53] <Kiernian> I never before believed conversation to be a skill that you needed to keep honed because it came so easily to me, but that's probably because I did it all the damned time. now add the possibility of "everyone's a potential carrier" in any public situation and...everyone can stay the fuck over there.
[08:37:46] <misspwn> yeah at least our venue required proof of vaccination or a negative test couple days prior. granted now with the variant it should really be day of
[08:38:11] <misspwn> i saw her tuesday was sick on friday where it usually takes longer to incubate 
[08:38:27] <Kiernian> is daily testing even good enough? my best friend's kid went to a show that required a negative test day of or day prior and still got it.
[08:38:52] <Kiernian> it'll have to come down to "test at door" or some shit

[08:40:14] <yuken> Kiernian, I don't think a single place around here even has "wear a mask" signs up anymore.
[08:40:34] <misspwn> yeah we're not really discussing that because it's well known now 
[08:41:06] <misspwn> we have an active mask mandate in place but stores have taken the signs down. it is over regardless of what data shows
[08:41:30] <Kiernian> we have an active mask mandate in my city with signs up and enforcement, but I think that's only for another few weeks
[08:41:46] <yuken> It's been completely gone here since early 2021.
[08:41:52] <yuken> No one really gives a shit anymore.
[08:42:30] <misspwn> i hope that we put more pressure on employers regarding sick time, because if we're going to treat it like a seasonal thing or something that is always around people need to be able to not be at work and get paid
[08:42:40] <Kiernian> yup
[08:43:28] <misspwn> we can't effectively get over it and tell people to stay home if they are scared, but threaten to fire them or dock wages because they are sick for any reason
[08:44:51] <Kiernian> Agreed

[09:00:48] <misspwn> true, i mean we shouldn't have to subject ourselves even working remotely if you are sick unless maybe it was the tail-end and you felt decent enough. even more so for those who do no have that ability. it's insane how we just keep normalizing it and then employers are like "why can't we keep people, no one wants to work for us?"

[09:50:31] <misspwn> time to get dog a stuffed hedgehog, for no reason other than company. unless you think he would tear that up too
[09:50:44] <xe0n> aaaaaaandddddddd it's gone
[09:50:58] <Cl0udNinja> do you have any idea how many times I've bought toys from the store because he broke them in the store?
[09:50:59] <misspwn> and that foam goes everywhere too lmao
[09:51:08] <Cl0udNinja> or how many stuffed animals fluff I've had to pick up over the years?
[09:51:27] <Cl0udNinja> theres a reason his name is Chewy
[09:51:32] <misspwn> i have kids so i can kinda relate
[09:52:05] <misspwn> my 4 year old out of the blue decided he was just gona start spitting on the floor because he didn't want to swallow his spit
[09:52:19] <Cl0udNinja> I mean, have you ever thought about spit?
[09:52:27] <Cl0udNinja> I see his point
[09:52:31] <misspwn> well yeah i spit outside if i am outside so i get it
[09:52:48] <misspwn> but i watched him and was like actually speechless
[09:53:07] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[09:54:20] <misspwn> come to think of it we had a dalmation as a kid that would destroy all my moms shoes but just one of the shoes and my dad would say well maybe if you put them away. that was until he saw the dog open the closet and chew her boots
[09:54:37] <xe0n> loooll
[09:54:49] <Cl0udNinja> dalmations are too damn smart
[09:55:15] <Cl0udNinja> my friend had one that weighed more than I do, because he figured out how to open the fridge, so often that they had to actually padlock it
[09:55:39] <misspwn> they can be real assholes too though, and yeah had to put locks on things. he stuck around until he snipped at my brother and had to get stitches
[09:55:53] <misspwn> our basset hound though was the best dog ever
[09:55:55] <SirSceptalot> hey, snitches get stitches
[09:56:44] <Cl0udNinja> I've only had one problem dog, it was a husky that got REALLY aggressive when people were loving on each other and snuggling together
[09:57:04] <misspwn> 10/10 would get another basset. why do some dogs get that jealous though
[09:57:17] <xe0n> he wanted them to do it doggy style
[09:57:17] <xe0n> :P
[09:57:20] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[09:57:22] <Cl0udNinja> BANT
[09:58:12] <misspwn> well we had a siamese cat who would attack someone if they went near me when she was around. some breeds are just weird even if you don't give them that upbringing to encourage that kind of behavior
[09:58:25] <misspwn> totally not breed shaming by the way, there are common traits
[09:58:32] <Cl0udNinja> all cats are assholes
[09:58:36] <misspwn> :D
[09:58:43] <misspwn> and yet i can't say nooooooooooo
[09:58:44] <Cl0udNinja> we had a kitten who would fight you for anything and everything
[09:59:04] <Cl0udNinja> and my friends siamese tried to attack my brother when he was a baby because he was crying
[09:59:11] <misspwn> SEE
[09:59:37] <misspwn> some of them are just megaassholes regardless
[09:59:41] <Cl0udNinja> yep
[10:00:17] <SirSceptalot> getting attacked in earnest by a cat doesn't seem like fun though
[10:00:24] <Cl0udNinja> its not
[10:00:24] <misspwn> past 4 cats have been maine coons, love em with all their personalities and floof levels
[10:00:33] <SirSceptalot> just kinda playfighting with one is all fine and dandy, you get stratched up a bit but ok
[10:00:33] <Cl0udNinja> but luckily cats are light and can be thrown
[10:01:10] <SirSceptalot> yeah, but if they really hook a full claw in your flesh and you have to get them out... Doesn't seem fun. Never had it happen though, all my cats have been allright
[10:01:14] <misspwn> oh i had adopted a "feral" barn cat and it would lunge at me from the basement rafters and one day i just threw the cat outside into the woods
[10:01:18] <misspwn> like be one with nature, bitch
[10:01:23] <Cl0udNinja> haha
[10:01:32] <Cl0udNinja> BYE FELINESHA
[10:01:38] <SirSceptalot> lol
[10:01:40] <misspwn> that cat was demonic
[10:02:02] <SirSceptalot> felinesha :D
[10:02:17] <misspwn> to be fair i think it just wanted to be outside and was hoping to get out. i don't normally yeet cats
[10:02:20] <Cl0udNinja> well glad you liked it, I thought I might have forced it lol
[10:02:54] <misspwn> hopefully you don't have a bean bag chair LOL
[10:03:09] <misspwn> could you imagine the mess that would be
[10:03:22] <Cl0udNinja> I've seen a beanbag explosion. I know the mess lol
[10:03:31] <Cl0udNinja> I laughed and walked away, no way in fuck I was helpin clean that up
[10:03:52] <misspwn> that might be up there with glitter
[10:04:00] <misspwn> the glitter you can see, but can't seem to clean
[10:04:04] <Cl0udNinja> haha
[10:04:19] <Cl0udNinja> I sent my friend a bag of dicks and they glitter bombed it for $1
[10:04:22] <Cl0udNinja> she was so pissed
[10:09:09] <SirSceptalot> Never thought I'd say this, but I'm going to need someone context on that bag of dicks Cl0udNinja

[10:14:15] <Oxfff> But.. maybe, you can do more damage if your enemy acutally likes eating dicks. 
[10:14:25] <Oxfff> they might get distracted and confused about their sexuality.
[10:14:43] <Oxfff> and miss their target since they can only focus on this bag of dicks?

[12:51:49] <SirSceptalot> Boss has a in/out-door furniture store, and he asked if i could have a go at designing and rendering a remodelling for the upper floor
[12:52:03] <lancehead_> Ooh nice
[12:52:18] <SirSceptalot> although this falls 100% in the "not my job" category, I've been wanting to learn blender for quite a while now, so now I get to do it during work hours
[12:53:12] <SirSceptalot> Unsurprisingly, going from 0 to interior architect isn't something that I'm accomplishing in 2 days :p
[12:53:46] <lancehead_> I asked if she knows of any good resources for learning blender
[12:53:52] <lancehead_> video/tutorial series or something 
[12:54:16] <lancehead_> Response so far is, and I quote, "Ah fuck I'll have to see"

[13:20:54] <lancehead_> I can think of a few
[13:21:38] <lancehead_> A jew, a black person, a Mexican and a Sony surround system walk into a bar. The bartender looks at the Sony and says "Hey you! We don't like stereo types in here!"
[13:21:54] <Kiernian> uff da.
[13:22:01] <SirSceptalot> :D
[13:22:16] <SirSceptalot> uff da?
[13:22:49] <lancehead_> Is that a Scottish thing?..
[13:23:09] <lancehead_> sounds pretty scottish 
[13:23:22] <Kiernian> scandanavian, mostly norwegian
[13:24:26] <lancehead_> ahh 
[13:24:31] <lancehead_> What's it mean 
[13:25:43] <Kiernian> well...that's a slightly more difficult question because it's evolved a bit once it made it over to the US.
[13:25:56] <SirSceptalot> is it similar ot "oida" or "perkele"?
[13:26:32] <lancehead_> lol perkele
[13:26:33] <Kiernian> don't know either of those
[13:27:04] <lancehead_> perkele is finnish and i think it means something along the lines of "fuck" or "goddammit"
[13:27:12] <Kiernian> haha. no, nothing anywhere nearly that harsh.
[13:27:20] <xe0n> depends how you use it isn't it?
[13:27:24] <lancehead_> yeah 
[13:27:56] <lancehead_> if you're chasing off a brown bear that's eating your trash, it'd be "goddammit"; if you stub your toe, it's "fuck"
[13:27:59] <SirSceptalot> yeah, it does, but it's something that they use for pretty much any situation. The meaning is pretty much solely in the intonation (as I understand it)
[13:28:09] <Kiernian> ah, interesting
[13:28:28] <SirSceptalot> like zo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuXR53ex4iI
[13:28:41] <lancehead_> brb, coffee shits
[13:28:49] <Kiernian> similar enough, then. The tone has more to do with the emotion conveyed in the american-descendants-of usage

[18:39:46] <lancehead_> They can only be found (in large number) on a small island off the coast of brazil that's closed off to the public 
[18:40:29] <lancehead_> Because they're VERY venomous, due to only being able to prey on birds and each other. in the case of birds, think paralyzing a seagull instantly so it doesn't get away

I come in and find things like...a 2008r2 domain controller and wifi that's been broken for 4 months due to missing vlans on trunk ports, and basically go "da fuck guys"
[20:50:57] <sd> 13<C​olour> Dunno it's difficult you can't read someones mind. Just because someone interviews elsewhere doesn't necessarily mean they're looking to move.
[20:51:09] <sd> 13<C​olour> Can only chat to them tbh
[20:51:18] <DrZak> the question is - can you get better ?
[20:51:20] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> yeah, i guess I just need to do the awkward sit down convo
[20:51:37] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> I think I could train up better, but it's the middle time that's the worry

[20:51:45] <DrZak> i mean, can you hire a better employee, or for those money, you just going to end up with another devil, one you dont even know
[20:51:46] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> i'm never gonna get A level talent for our wages
[20:51:56] <sd> 13<C​olour> I've told previous companies when I've been looking but I'm a special case
[20:51:56] <signofzeta> My old boss was like that too.  "I hate MFA, therefore my customers hate it too," and I'd have to ignore common sense or else he'd email me every ten minutes until it was resolved.
[20:52:06] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> @Colour the guys he's interviewing with let me know. Not the bossman making the decision. He's up against 3 internals, one of them is a buddy, etc.

[20:52:13] <sd> 13<C​olour> Ah
[20:52:26] <signofzeta> then he tried to fight the children, until cyberinsurance was a thing

[20:53:01] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> Lets throw it all out there too: People called him on his shit internally about a year ago, examples given of areas of issue, paper trails showing where he lied, etc. Old bossman swept it under hte rug, and the employee who called him out left

[20:53:28] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> @bdenlinger not the company itself. The friend I went to college with was like "oh hey, see I'm up against so and so for this job, isn't he your guy?"

Then they came back and said "we think you're worth more" and offered me $22K more than I made back then -- but hourly, so if I busted my stones, I got paid for it.
[20:58:15] <signofzeta> Only then did my former boss offer to match it.
[20:58:27] <signofzeta> But not before offering me smaller raises.

That being said, I think re-publicizing the post office as a not-for-profit agency is the right move.  Let the Republicans switch to FedEx.

[23:15:38] <Reinhilde> the 75 year pension mandate that is exclusively placed on the post office to make it look like it's at a deficit compared to private couriers is part of the narrative to make you ask "why do we need USPS?"
