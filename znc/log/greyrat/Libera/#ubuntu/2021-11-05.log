[01:04:50] <sarnold> it's the main archive not having https that's been long desired
[01:05:02] <TJ-> It's possible to disable the PCI device; e.g. given "lspci -nn -d ::0300" reports the device  0a:00.0  then  "echo 0 > 0a:00.0 " will disable that device

[05:02:46] <Gallomimia> pycurious, scp is one of your best options for securly transfering files. you can open a listen server on a port that is not 22 and avoid having those machines exposed to the myriad of botnets that try to penetrate the SSH port every day. you can also limit what's available on that listen server. i recommend using RSA or similar keys to give access to the sending machine, allowing passwordless unattended results.

[08:15:26] <KBar> Rockwood: please, refer to this beautiful tutorial: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview
[08:15:40] <KBar> To get familiar with the command line.
[08:16:04] <KBar> Rockwood it will take 20 minutes at most.
[08:16:06] <Rockwood> https://kopy.io/sDb87
[08:16:24] <Rockwood> sorry for blindly paste :(
[08:16:37] <Rockwood> you said run this comman d
[08:16:53] <Rockwood> command and i pasted that is too :D
[08:17:25] <Rockwood> anyway still few files remain ther e
[08:17:41] <Rockwood> i wanna copy that those too
[08:17:59] <KBar> Rockwood don't just paste commands into shell. Read and understand them first.
[08:18:16] <Rockwood> sure i will keep it in my mind this too
[08:18:23] <swalladge> ok cool, so you can repeat your `mv` command, but like this:
[08:18:27] <swalladge> mv /var/www/api.rockwood.test/s-cart/.* /var/www/api.rockwood.test
[08:18:43] <swalladge> note the period before the * to glob the dotfiles
[08:19:05] <KBar> Rockwood some commands may ruin your whole system and render it completely unusable. Especially the ones starting with `sudo`.
[08:19:22] <Rockwood> mv: cannot move '/var/www/api.rockwood.test/s-cart/.' to '/var/www/api.rockwood.test/.': Device or resource busy
[08:19:27] <Rockwood> ok
[08:19:36] <Rockwood> sudo need here i think now
[08:19:41] <swalladge> oooh no wait
[08:19:46] <Rockwood> ok
[08:20:09] <swalladge> what command did you run?
[08:21:26] <Rockwood> mv /var/www/api.rockwood.test/s-cart/.* /var/www/api.rockwood.test
[08:21:29] <Rockwood> this one
[08:22:08] <swalladge> huh it should work.  Maybe avoid the globbing and move each file individually
[08:22:26] <Rockwood> okay
[08:22:29] <oerheks> one would be member of the www-data group, to do so
[08:22:35] *** Quits: Bashing-om (~sysop@ubuntu/member/bashing-om) (Quit: leaving)

[08:22:39] <swalladge> etc.
[08:23:11] <swalladge> that's true, it could be file permissions, rather than missing files that's causing the 500 errors
[08:23:12] <Rockwood> still error
[08:23:17] <Rockwood> mv: cannot stat '/var/www/api.rockwood.test/s-cart/.env': No such file or directory
[08:23:38] <oerheks> if you could copy before, then something else is going on. maybe files are in use
[08:23:38] <swalladge> ok they've been moved then
[08:23:58] <swalladge> you can `ls -a` the /var/www/api.rockwood.test/ directory to check
[08:24:44] <Rockwood> swalladge, https://kopy.io/2CFh4
[08:25:38] <Rockwood> https://kopy.io/p4JfT
[08:26:00] <swalladge> I highly recommend going through the tutorial that KBar linked to.  I'm not sure you're understanding what's going on in the terminal, and I'm worried that you'll accidentally nuke the server by pasting something unexpected
[08:26:14] <KBar> +1
[08:26:25] <swalladge> but yep that second screenshot looks good.  I reckon your files are now where they should be
[08:26:42] <Rockwood> but i am facing still HTTP ERROR 500

[10:34:21] <tomreyn> slingamn: "non-interactive" suppresses the prompts and forces debconf to go with the default setting. i assume the default will be not to restart services most of the time, but it really depends on their defaults.
[10:34:37] <slingamn> it's a per-library default?

[11:04:46] <b247_eu> Im looking for an advice regarding a HP laptop (HP ProBook 440 G7 - https://ubuntu.com/certified/202005-27901)
[11:04:52] <ezakimak> looks like /etc/profile.d/var-env.sh is clobbering DISPLAY
[11:05:57] <slingamn> well, one of the reasons i want that behavior is that it's at parity with the behavior of 20.04 with unattended-upgrades
[11:06:34] <slingamn> i'm using nginx to proxy long-running TCP connections that can be fairly disruptive to tear down
[11:06:54] <tomreyn> b247_eu: what kind of advice specifically?

[11:09:16] <slingamn> it's IRC actually, it can be weeks
[11:09:32] <tomreyn> ezakimak: https://packages.ubuntu.com is not aware of this file location.
[11:10:10] <slingamn> i'm not planning on upgrading until 22.04.1 so that's almost a year out...just wanted to get a handle on my options

[11:13:54] <b247_eu> tomreyn, I've looked on the HP site, they have a lot of "recovery options" but only Windows images, nothing about Ubuntu; shall I contact (via email/other official ways) HP or Ubuntu for that?
[11:14:36] <slingamn> hmm

[14:08:21] <tosaraja> Is this a security issue or not? I have a Ubuntu host in which I run LXD containers. I opened a shell in one of those containers with 'lxc exec foobar bash' and ran tmux there. Now for some reason I got "Error: websocket: close 1006 (abnormal closure): unexpected EOF" whichafter I was thrown out of the lxc container. But the strange thing is, that i'm still inside the same tmux window. Which was launched inside the container. Normally I can't do this,
[14:08:21] <tosaraja> because running just simply exit to exit the lxd, it actually just exists the tmux. Might not be anything, but this seems so strange so I decided to ask here just in case.

[17:27:48] <ubottu> zenof: To get to the TTY terminals 3-6, use the keystroke Ctrl + Alt + F3-F6 respectively. Ctrl-Alt-F2 or Ctrl-Alt-F1 will get you back to your graphical login (Ctrl-Alt-F7 on 16.04). To change TTY resolution, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ChangeTTYResolution

[22:59:39] <leftyfb> tstirrat: use ncdu
[22:59:41] <tstirrat> that's also more than i've allocated in total for the root VG
[22:59:44] <tstirrat> what's ncdu?

[23:00:19] <Gallomimia> Ronalds_Mazitis_, that symlink didn't point at anything. your home directory is not the place where library files are found
[23:00:19] <leftyfb> tstirrat: sudo ncdu /   # this will show you what's taking up space and where. It's a nice ncurses interface for du basically

[23:00:38] <tstirrat> ah kk
[23:00:44] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> yeah, I get that my error is makelists file right now
[23:00:45] <tstirrat> it looks like it stays within the filesystem by default
[23:00:51] <tstirrat> and it looks like there's 6gb of syslog
[23:00:57] <leftyfb> Ronalds_Mazitis_: ok, I would suggest asking for further help with your qt project and the IDE in #qt
[23:01:00] <tstirrat> is that something that i can safely delete if i'm not currently using it for debugging?

[23:01:29] <Gallomimia> Ronalds_Mazitis_, i also suggest you put your project on hold and spend an hour or two learning about the files you're trying to muck with unsuccessfully
[23:01:31] <leftyfb> tstirrat: how big is your drive? 6G isn't a lot of space
[23:01:53] <tstirrat> it's not, but i've got things set up with LVM
[23:02:03] <tstirrat> so i've got 20gb allocated for root and more for other things (docker, home, etc)
[23:02:04] <Gallomimia> it's a partition. if using LVM 15 gigs is plenty for an install
[23:02:45] <Gallomimia> but yeah. you got syslogs swollen up. sounds like you need to configure how much is kept, or put them in a new location
[23:04:28] <tstirrat> yeah this is related to some weird hibernate instabilities that have been happening since i upgraded to the most recent distro
[23:04:31] <tstirrat> i'll figure it out eventualy
[23:04:39] <tstirrat> but it looks like i can just truncate/empty syslog in the meantime
[23:06:31] <VMGuy23> xfce the theme is weirdly dark even though its a light theme
