[03:34:53] <KirkMcDonald> Strictly speaking, yes, that can be considered a breaking change. But depending on context it might be possible to let it slide.

[18:49:39] <fizzie> McQuestionable: It kind of does. I think the reason for the confusion is: (a) you're passing `&obj` to reflect.ValueOf, so that's different: what it gets -- converted to an interface{} -- is a pointer to another interface{}, that in runtime sense contains a (type, pointer) pair referring to that struct; and (b) you're passing plain `obj` to reflect.TypeOf, so in that case the interface value
[18:49:41] <fizzie> doesn't *need* any wrapping and just gets passed as-is, so the result of TypeOf describes that struct type directly.
[18:50:23] <Tv_> no "kind of" there, it *does*
[18:51:09] <Tv_> function arguments are just another form of assignment

[18:57:58] <McQuestionable> I'm still struggling with one more thing -- when I set one of the fields using   objValue().field(i).SetString("somestring"), it runs fine but doesn't actually change the string in the original obj
[19:01:07] <A_Dragon> does objValue hold a pointer?
[19:12:26] <fizzie> If it held a *pointer*, you couldn't call .Field(i) on it, because pointers don't have fields. But yeah, it could be a value-vs-pointer thing. Though I think usually when I've ran into those kinds of trouble (mostly just playing with reflect out of curiosity), it's ended up with a set method panicking about "unaddressable value", not just silently failing.
[19:14:06] <A_Dragon> setting strings is weird.

[19:16:58] <McQuestionable> looks like the issue isn't setString, but canset(), which is failing
[19:17:06] <McQuestionable> *canset is returning false
[19:17:19] <A_Dragon> well that would make sense :P
[19:17:24] <A_Dragon> given that strings are immutable
[19:17:44] <McQuestionable> OMG
[19:26:38] <fizzie> SetString doesn't *try* to mutate strings.
[19:26:52] <fizzie> It just sets a string-typed value to contain a different string altogether.
[19:26:53] <CRThaze> Interesting. I've been able to successfully update strings suing SetString
[19:27:31] <fizzie> Think `a := "foo"; a = "bar"`, that's what reflect.Value's SetString does.
[19:28:02] <CRThaze> The canset situation seems like it might have more to do with why you can't update it, than it simply being a string
[19:28:29] <fizzie> https://play.golang.org/p/m_FP5eKwmYh uses SetString without any trouble.
[19:28:59] <fizzie> https://play.golang.org/p/odE4DSFm1pd on the other hand will panic with that "unaddressable value" error I mentioned.
[19:29:00] <CRThaze> McQuestionable: How is your original object you're reflecting created?
[19:30:53] <fizzie> A reflect.Value is only addressable "if it is an element of a slice, an element of an addressable array, a field of an addressable struct, or the result of dereferencing a pointer" (from the docs of CanAddr).
[19:30:54] <CRThaze> fizzie: those examples both make total sense, and no sense whatsoever. haha.
[19:31:18] <CRThaze> McQuestionable: so if CanSet is false, is CanAddr also false?
[19:32:22] <McQuestionable> sorry, in the background i've been trying to resolve   reflect.Value.SetString using unaddressable value when trying to objValue.Field(i).SetString(valToSet)
[19:32:42] <McQuestionable> objValue.Field(i).Type().Name()    interestingly, this returns "string"
[19:34:10] <mort> so, how do I get go to make non-read-only files in GOROOT?
[19:34:44] <mort> it's a problem for me that 'rm -rf' doesn't delete them in a context where some automated system builds some go stuff
[19:35:02] <McQuestionable> everything else (finding tags, names of fields using typeof) works as expected, it's just the setString I've got to solve

[19:41:17] <nevivurn> In that case, run clean -modcache before the tooling that runs rm -rf runs
[19:42:29] <fizzie> There was an issue about that, I think it pretty much just concluded with "we think the benefits of marking the files read-only is worth the trouble it causes".
[19:42:42] <mort> nevivurn: I'm not running rm -rf, bitbake does that automatically
[19:42:49] <mort> fizzie: there are literally no benefits to it though
[19:43:00] <mort> I'm not going in there and touching stuff
[19:43:10] <nevivurn> There are very good benefits, such as having correct builds
[19:43:11] <fizzie> The alleged benefits were something like avoiding badly written tests accidentally touching files in there, or whatnot.
[19:43:24] <mort> nevivurn: why would your builds be incorrect when there are unmodified files in GOMODCACHE
[19:44:11] <fizzie> https://github.com/golang/go/issues/31481
[19:44:16] <nevivurn> Yeah, but you will probably run into issues when you do modify them, no?
[19:44:29] <fizzie> Apparently I misremembered and they did add a flag for it.
[19:44:37] <mort> nevivurn: what are you talking about?
[19:44:40] <nevivurn> ?
[19:44:50] <mort> "you will probably run into issues when you do modify them"
[19:44:55] <mort> why would you do that
[19:45:05] <fizzie> mort: -modcacherw: leave newly-created directories in the module cache read-write instead of making them read-only.
[19:45:07] <nevivurn> I may have misunderstood what you said, then. Sorry about that.

[19:45:44] <mort> I mean unless you're thinking about `rm -rf <modcache directory` nobody's talking about modifying cache files
[19:46:32] <nevivurn> Ah, I would say deleting files in there does count as modifying files, but yeah, if the only goal is to purge the entire cache, you're completely right.
[19:46:52] <nevivurn> I was addressing the point of there being no benefit to having it be readonly.
[19:47:24] <fizzie> And https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27161 is the (earlier) issue that has some of the arguments.
[19:48:09] <fizzie> (Maybe I read it *before* they decided to add that flag, and therefore didn't remember it.)
[19:49:23] <nevivurn> I'm surprised it's been in there for so long, had no idea it existed.
[19:49:43] <fizzie> *tl;dr* `GOFLAGS=-modcacherw` in your build environment configuration or w/e.
[19:49:56] <mort> it's a bit unfortunate that Linux has no way to mark something as deletable but not modifiable, that would've been a pretty good solution overall I think

[21:02:44] <zsnes> deleting a file is the same thing as modifying it so I don't think that makes sense. You could delete it and replace it with your own version of the file then.
[21:03:04] <zsnes> linux doesn't let you delete files without +w on the file regardless of the directory haveing +w
[21:03:37] <zsnes> +w on the directory just decides if you can CREATE files in it or not.
[21:03:54] <siXy> mort: FWIW selinux does let you do exactly that.
[21:05:18] <siXy> In an selinux policy Delete, Open, Read, Write, Append etc are all seperate permissions, so you can create logfiles that you can only append to, session files that can be created and deleted but not modified, etc etc.
