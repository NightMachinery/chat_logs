[01:26:32] <mpan> Mathisen: a process that will handle providing credentials etc. to other programs.

[05:14:30] <alloy> asahi linux looks interesting, only for the mac arm chips though (so clearly a VERY new distro)
[05:14:55] <alloy> nboot_linux, did it work properly in windows/macos firstly?

[07:09:32] <noobaroo> I'm probably not best qualified to give you an answer, but... 1. Don't you mean frontend? 2. What GUI toolkit a program uses is usually either chosen at compile time or not chosen at all 
[07:11:05] <woodwose> that's not true
[07:11:25] <woodwose> there is /etc/pinentry/preexec
[07:11:31] <woodwose> it lets you add them
[07:11:48] <woodwose> also debian and gentoo have tools to change the order 
[07:12:11] <woodwose> guess I answered it myself
[07:12:26] <woodwose> also, noobaroo, if you look at the PKGBUILD
[07:12:35] <woodwose> it mentiones the "BACKends"

[14:42:45] <demonicmaniac1> are you using a login manager or startx? i remember teamviewer like 2 years ago or so mandating some login manager and not working with startx

[16:25:56] <jonathon> also,
[16:25:59] <Ghosthree3> should be
[16:26:00] <jonathon> !Syyu
[16:26:01] <phrik> The double yy in `pacman -Syyu` is almost never needed. If you're switching to a mirror that uses an older copy of the repos, see !Syyuu instead. Unless your repo databases are completely corrupted, force-downloading already-up-to-date ones accomplishes nothing other than to waste bandwidth and server load. Do your part in conserving the internet, and avoid Syyu!
[16:26:25] <Namarrgon> which packages were updated during the second -Syu?

[16:26:43] <dav1d> !Syyuu
[16:26:43] <phrik> If you switch to a pacman mirror using an older database, *don't worry*. Just -Syu like normal and you will only ever get clean updates (or 404 file not found errors which are harmless if annoying; just wait a day or two and they'll go away). If you're switching to an older mirror and wish to downgrade, see !ala and use -Syyuu (the double uu ensures the actual downgrade part).
[16:26:48] <dav1d> oh
[16:26:57] <Namarrgon> just one?
[16:27:05] <Bayes> Namarrgon yup, just that one

[16:29:25] <Ghosthree3> they just said arch broke python, they couldnt do anythign with pip, downgrading python-pyparsing fixed it
[16:29:36] <Ghosthree3> i imagine it was a temporary issue that was already fixed tbh
[16:29:40] <Ghosthree3> some late pushed rebuild
[16:30:01] <demonicmaniac1> sounds more like a potential upstream issue given pyparsing 3.0.3 3.0.4 3.0.5 were released/packaged on consecutive days
[16:30:48] <Ghosthree3> haha
[16:31:04] <Ghosthree3> i do wonder why they were using pip at all, they must have been doing devil work

[16:31:54] <Bayes> oh here's what happened! http://ix.io/3Tlr

[18:13:32] <wereii> FFY00, Foxboron: Is there anything I can do to help with this issue ? https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/73763
[18:13:33] <phrik> Title: FS#73763 : [python-wxpython] Incompatible with python310 (at bugs.archlinux.org)

[18:14:45] <Foxboron> wereii: probably not
[18:15:10] <Foxboron> I suspect the needed commit needs quite a few backported commits to work properly (it's probably not the only issue) and wxWidgets/Phoenix depends on an unreleased wxwidgets

[18:15:43] <Foxboron> you can though try to do the backport and explain the bugreport if it works or not

[18:18:10] <wereii> > unreleased wxwidgets, I see I was wondering why it's rather old compared to latest Phoenix
[18:18:20] <grawity> ok, pipewire-pulse seems to work
[18:18:52] <Ghosthree3> yep, seems to just drop in and go
[18:18:56] <wereii> I will look at the backport, that could help (Phoenix releases seem to take a lot of time anyway)

[18:20:06] <Foxboron> and even building with vendored wxwidgets doesn't really solve anything either
[18:20:14] <Foxboron> I havent looked at it the past year :/

[23:50:36] <thursdaylark> jab416171: search the pacman manpage for "foreign packages"
[23:50:53] <jab416171> that doesn't include aur though does it thursdaylark

[23:51:11] <thursdaylark> are your aur packages a part of a repo that pacman knows about?
[23:51:22] <jab416171> they're part of the aur
[23:51:27] <jab416171> which isn't technically a repo, so no
[23:51:29] <thursdaylark> that's not the question
[23:51:40] <thursdaylark> yeah, so they would be classified as foreign packages
[23:52:27] <jab416171> makes sense
[23:52:42] <jab416171> I guess another option would be to parse ~/.cache/aurman/known_package_places
[23:53:44] <thursdaylark> aur helpers aren't supported here, so you'd have to seek aurman's docs or support community for that answer
[23:53:58] <jab416171> yeah I know, just thinking outloud
[23:54:24] <jab416171> but pacman -Qqm definitely helps as a starting point, thanks!
