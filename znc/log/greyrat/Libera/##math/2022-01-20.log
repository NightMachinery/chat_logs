[01:00:55] <kamil> Simplar : for n >= p it is abvoius, so you can check only case n < p
[01:00:56] <emx> Hi. If I round the number 0.0149 to two decimals, will I get 0.02 because I consider the 9 and therefore the first step yields 0.0150 and then 0.02 or do I consider the third decimal (4) which tells me that it's lower than 5 and therefore I round straight from 0.0149 to 0.01 as if it the number was 0.014?
[01:01:42] <int-e> n = p-1 will be on the list. (this... is probably not very helpful.)
[01:01:54] <PlanckWalk> emx: There are not two steps
[01:02:05] <PlanckWalk> 0.0149 rounds to 0.01
[01:02:15] <emx> PlanckWalk, thanks.
[01:05:49] <PlanckWalk> emx: Fundementally this is because the base 10 is even.  You could round in multiple steps for an odd base and it would make no difference.

[07:55:13] <somiaj> Well you want F = a u + b v, where u and v are unit vectors, you can do something similar and set up a system of equations, not sure of an easier way

[07:56:41] <somiaj> magic_ninja: so F.v = a u.v + b v.v, but now since they aren't orthogonaly, u.v isn't zero, so you have F.v = a u.v + b, and F.u = a + b u.v

[08:00:25] <magic_ninja> I'm going to practice it and add it to my tool box
[08:00:46] <tusko> I have some trouble understanding the ambiguity or lack thereof of using k vs n in inductive proof. Here is an example of how I would write this simple inductive proof. https://imgur.com/a/njHGCN1
[08:00:57] <magic_ninja> But how do you define u and v?
[08:01:06] <tusko> Could anyone offer commentary about the method of argument and how I could imrpove that?
[08:01:13] <magic_ninja> Their relative angle to F?
[08:01:16] <Guest2527> I have learned prob & stat in high school and I think I am solid in fundamentals. Is this course good for college level stat? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw&list=EC2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo Anyone tried this?
[08:01:46] <somiaj> magic_ninja: in this case they are unit vectors in the direction of u and v respecitvally, but when you take the dot product, u.v = |u| |v| cos(theta) = cos(theta) since they are unit vectors
[08:02:22] <somiaj> and F.v = |F| cos(angle between F and v), F.u = |F| cos(angle between F and u). It just simplifies things to use unit vectors.

[08:05:39] <magic_ninja> That makes sense. You are just making triangles out of the two, but since they aren't orthogonal, there is some other number they are being multiplied by.
[08:05:57] <magic_ninja> like an axis rotation or such
[08:06:46] <somiaj> geometrically you could try to find the parallelgram based on the angles and geometry, I just prefer the dot product for somethign like this

[08:08:25] <somiaj> basically take a line parallel v, put it at the tip of F, figure out where it intersect u, and then find the lenghts of the resulting sides

[08:09:20] <somiaj> well that is just a triangle, or half the parallelgram, anywas
[08:09:34] <somiaj> so as you said law of cosines could have worked
[08:10:10] <somiaj> actually just law of sines might be enough, since you know three angles and a single side
[08:10:45] <magic_ninja> The dot product seems to make more sense to me.
[08:10:55] <magic_ninja> solving a system is super fast with a casio 115

[15:37:56] <cadmio> it is reducible over R because (x+sqrt(2)(x-sqrt(2)) but there's no such sqrt(2) in Q
[15:39:53] <Pollion> Hello cadmio. Do you know how to prove irreducibility over Q ?
[15:40:15] <Pollion> If yes, then you can try to mimic the proof for Q(sqrt(3))
[15:40:43] <Pollion> The key point, is that you already know the complex roots of this polynomial and it is of degree 2
[15:41:01] <cadmio> Pollion: does my argument above makes sense? if so, sqrt(2) is neither in Q(sqrt(3)) because the adjoint is sqrt(3) and not sqrt(2)
[15:41:30] <Pollion> By the way, is it x^2 - 2 or x^2 - 5 ?
[15:41:43] <Pollion> Because if it is x^2 - 5 your root is not sqrt(2)
[15:42:10] <Pollion> Anyway, your argument is not a proof
[15:42:29] <cadmio> x^2 - 5
[15:42:48] <Pollion> Ok then what are the complex roots of this polynomial ?
[15:42:51] <cadmio> yes I meant sqrt(5)
[15:42:56] <Pollion> Yes. I agree.
[15:43:39] <Pollion> Now, why irreducibility of this polynomial is equivalent to sqrt(5) \notin K where K = Q or Q(sqrt(3)) ?
[15:43:50] <Pollion> Once you are convinced of this, you can proceed
[15:43:57] <Pollion> But your argument is not sufficient.
[15:44:12] <Pollion> Maybe, by adding sqrt(3) to Q you also added sqrt(5).

[15:49:43] <cadmio> but this does not exclude that f(x) could be divisible by another poly
[15:49:49] <Pollion> It is not sufficient. A polynomial can be reducible but without roots in the field.
[15:50:07] <Pollion> In your case it works because your polynomial is very particuliar.
[15:50:12] <Pollion> What is its degree ?
[15:50:25] <cadmio> 2
[15:52:01] <cadmio> I think that for degree 2 or 3 if f(x) has no roots in Q then it's irreducible
[15:52:10] <cadmio> but I've studied reducibility a long time ago
[15:52:50] <Pollion> Yes exactly. Do you understand why this is true ?
[15:52:56] <Pollion> It is not hard
[15:54:27] <cadmio> as I said before it must be divisible by (x-a) and by Ruffini's theorem it's have a root in Q
[15:55:34] <Pollion> Yes but you don't use the fact that the degree is 2 (maybe it's clear for you I don't know but you don't say it).
[15:56:40] <cadmio> if  p(x) | f(x) it must have degree less than that of f(x)
[15:56:48] <cadmio> since f(x) is 2 it must be 1
[15:57:04] <Pollion> Yes, exactly.
[15:57:25] <Pollion> You see that it is not necessarily true for polynomials of higher degree.
[15:57:48] <Pollion> Of course, if a polynomial is irreducible it has no roots, but the converse is true only for degree 2 or 3
[15:57:55] <cadmio> hmm for 3 it should be
[15:58:50] <Pollion> Ok now, you only need to prove that sqrt(5) is not in Q (resp not in Q(sqrt(5))).

[16:00:20] <Pollion> (By the way, note that when you use this proof, you need to be aware of a higher field in which your polynomial splits. Here C (or R) do the trick. But it can be messy for higher degree polynomials, or when you don't want / can't use a higher field, and you need to develop other technique. For instance eisenstein criterion.)
[16:01:32] <Pollion> cadmio: It can, of course. But let f be a polynomial of degree 3. Assume f is not irreducible. Then there exists p of degree 1 or 2 dividing f.
[16:01:42] <Pollion> If p is of degree 1, you are done and f has a root.

[16:43:36] <Pollion> Eisenstein criterion is also rather special
[16:44:15] <Gurkenglas> The reason I ask is because I usually do category theory and everything there feels like if I were designed properly I could solve everything straightforwardly, it all fits together. And number theory of all fields looks the least like it's compatible with "it's all supposed to be trivial"

[16:54:50] <cherim> If you have a finite set of words and simple rules of forming sentences, you can start enumerating all sentences of length 1,2,3,... and it will look as smooth as category theory
[16:55:02] <Pollion> category theory is a bit like a pandora box for me. You need to understand what you are doing if you use it, and you may lose concreteness.
[16:55:24] <cherim> People who use language to exchange meaningful information will not be very impressed though

[17:07:01] <riv> lol category thery suxxxx get rekt nerds
[17:10:05] <mycroftiv> are people considering 'category theory' distinct from 'homological algebra' and 'algebraic geometry' ? because when i read standard references and textbooks i feel like i have to learn a lot of category theory to understand these areas
[17:10:05] <riv> I just got the pun
[17:10:14] <riv> [S]erge [L]ang wrote a book called SL_2
[17:10:35] <riv> mycroftiv: yep, I don't k now any homological algebra at all, or alg. geom
[17:11:12] <mycroftiv> im speaking in terms of 'how is category theory useful mathematically' because i have had to learn all these categorical definitions to learn what i thought was mainstream mathematics
[17:11:53] <riv> It's like asking how algebraic notation is useful
[17:12:06] <Pollion> Conversely, depending on what you do, you can ignore category theory to do algebraic geometry, or homological algebra (if you keep concreteness). But you will lose all the power of this language.
[17:12:06] <riv> you can definitely do math with prose and roman numerals
[17:12:12] <riv> so you dont actually need algebraic notation at all

[21:12:49] <Z-module> the invertible things in F[x] are just the nonzero constant polys.
[21:13:41] <cadmio> I think nonconstant in that def would be better off
[21:13:58] <Z-module> So  2x + 4 = (2)(x + 2)  and that first factor there is invertible in R[x].   This is not a factorization for getting 2x + 4 reducible. In fact 2x + 4 is irreducible, as are all linear polys over a field.

[21:16:43] <Z-module> The invertible factor version comes in when you're over a ring that's not a field. FOr example in Z[x], where the only invertible things are 1 and -1,  both 2 and x + 2 are non-invertible, so here, 2x + 4 *is* reduciblle since both factors in (2)(x + 2)  are non-invertible in Z[x].

[21:18:43] <Z-module> You're right: For any field F, the simplest way to say that a poly in F[x] is reducible is to say it has an expression as  g(x) h(x)   there g, h are both non-constant.
[21:18:46] <cadmio> so the invertible things in F[x] with F a field are just the nonzero constant polys.

[21:20:31] <Z-module> a poly g(x) of degree 1 or higher, in F[x], can never be invertible, because if it had an inverse h(x), then h(x) != 0 so the product  g(x) h(x)  has degree  deg(g) + deg(h) >= 1  so this product can't be 1.

[22:38:31] <Z-module> It's very pretty math
[22:39:37] <isekaijin> Let's talk about how Galois theory breaks horribly in the presence of imperfect fields and inseparable extensions.
[22:39:40] <Z-module> When my intro algebra course in college ended, with Galois theory as the last unit, the professor turned around and said to the class of 15 or so people, "Galois thought of all that when he was about the same age as mot of you here."
[22:39:45] <Z-module> most*
[22:40:16] <johnkeats6> except that, unless your class was very peculiarly historical, he never thought of any of it :D

[22:42:11] <isekaijin> And you need to account for them in any reasonable treatment of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.
[22:42:35] <Z-module> By the way, did you know that someone showed in 1983 that every finite group does actually occur as Gal(K/Q) for some finite but not necessarily normal extension K ? It's quite elementary, in fact.
[22:42:51] <isekaijin> Wow.
[22:42:57] <johnkeats6> it's just every group embeds in S_n ain't it

[23:23:25] <Guest1778> Okay, I am reading what you wrote now.
[23:23:29] <isekaijin> I really prefer the format “The following propositions are equivalent: <long-ass lists of propositions>” to showing lots of double implications.

[23:24:12] <isekaijin> Argh, sorry.
[23:24:17] <isekaijin> Guest1778: Sorry, still something unclear.
[23:24:28] <Guest1778> Okay.
[23:24:41] <isekaijin> Guest1778: http://mathb.in/69768 -- fix'd
[23:25:36] <isekaijin> In both lists, the tricky step is showing that the third and fourth items are equivalent.
[23:26:05] <isekaijin> (1) <-> (2) <-> (3) and (4) <-> (5) are quite straightforward.
[23:29:25] <Guest1778> I think I can show (3) <-> (4) for the intersection scenario.
[23:30:17] <isekaijin> The key is that if S is a subset of the polynomial ring, and I is the ideal generated by S, then every f \in I vanishes at p iff every f \in S vanishes at p.
[23:30:43] <isekaijin> This establishes (3) <-> (4) in both cases.
[23:30:54] <Guest1778> oh, no, that is not what I was going to say. Actually, I was going to argue via generators again.

[23:36:11] <Guest1778> I agree with what you said though
[23:37:26] <[itchyjunk]> reflexive means a~b then b~a right?
[23:37:49] <riv> no thats symmetric
[23:37:52] <riv> reflexive is a~a
[23:38:09] <Z-module> for all a, of course
[23:38:13] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[23:38:22] <Guest1778> Thank you for the discussion about the proof.
[23:38:23] <Z-module> if that fails for even a *single* element, the relation is not reflexive
[23:38:27] <isekaijin> Guest1778: np
[23:38:30] <[itchyjunk]> reflexive like reflection, maybe i'll rememebr now
[23:38:48] <[itchyjunk]> right, for all a
[23:38:53] <Guest1778> Do you have any opinions about how I wrote the solutions for the two exercises I also mentioned?

[23:39:26] <Z-module> If you have   forall a  NOT(a ~ a),   then I think they usually call that an irreflexive relation.

[23:40:22] <node1> Hi
[23:40:43] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: I prefer to analogize it to reflexive verbs (in things like French) where the action happens to the subject, the same person.
[23:41:14] <[itchyjunk]> /o\ french
[23:41:28] <[itchyjunk]> associativity of function is via definition or is it profed?
[23:41:37] <[itchyjunk]> f(gh) = (fg)h
[23:41:53] <isekaijin> Function composition, you mean?
[23:42:00] <[itchyjunk]> yes function composition
[23:42:02] <Z-module> You prove it, but it's turbotrivial
[23:42:06] <isekaijin> ^
[23:42:07] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[23:42:12] <node1> If i have to define an empty set using properties then could write this as expression. ∅ = { x : x ≠ x } which meant  a ≠ a ?
[23:42:25] <riv> node1: you can't do this
[23:42:30] <node1> or 2 ≠ 2 ?
[23:42:47] <riv> set comprehensions must be a subset of some existing set
[23:42:57] <riv> i.e. { x in U : x =/= x }
[23:43:29] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: just remember that two functions r, s: X -> Y  are identical functions  iff    forall x in X, r(x) = s(x).  Use that where r = (fg)h and  s = f(gh)
[23:43:39] <node1> And what's this here =/= ?
[23:43:53] <ski>   ∅ = { x ∈ U | ⊥ }
[23:44:01] <isekaijin> node1: It's ≠ for people who don't want to be bothered typing it.
[23:44:02] <ski> node1 : "not equals"
[23:44:14] <node1> ok

[23:44:43] <isekaijin> ski: U is a universe or something like that?
[23:45:44] <node1> Let suppose in a venn diagram, Inside U(universal set) and in other two set let say A and B having no element then could we say it's empty set?
[23:46:01] <ski> yes. domain/universe of discourse. universal set. the set which ⌜x⌝ ranges over (often this is implicit, inferred from context or convention, either global or domain-specific)
[23:46:45] <ski> (⌜U⌝ is any set which you please, that you're interested in considering elements of (and perhaps also subsets of))

[23:52:33] <[itchyjunk]> i see. i thought of that at somepoint but changed my mind
[23:52:53] <node1> ok
[23:54:01] <ski> for a finite set, i guess you could enumerate the subsets .. but it would probably still look nicer with a Hasse diagram (representing not just the subsets as elements of the power set, but also representing the (inclusion) ordering between the subsets)
