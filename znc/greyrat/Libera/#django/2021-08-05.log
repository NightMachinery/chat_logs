[09:52:18] <asarch> One stupid question: how does a loader work? (https://semantic-ui.com/elements/loader.html). I mean, let's say someone wants the full list of the available students and then visit /students, so, in the controller you do the query, parse the result and prepare the data that the template needs to show the list
[09:53:40] *** Quits: mattil (~mattil@airio.portalify.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:54:24] <asarch> So, when do you use that loader effect?
[09:58:55] * FunkyBob checks which channel he's in
[09:59:38] <FunkyBob> asarch: are you asking what controls display of the spinner?  that would be your javascript
[09:59:53] <FunkyBob> when you say 'controler', do you mean view?
[10:02:29] <asarch> No, I mean the Python function that process the request: def index(request): return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")
[10:02:40] <FunkyBob> so yes, the view
[10:03:07] <FunkyBob> if you're trying to use MVC terminology... don't
[10:03:15] <asarch> ?
[10:03:16] <FunkyBob> it's going to confuse people, and it's inapplicable
[10:03:49] <asarch> I thought the view was actually the template
[10:03:54] <FunkyBob> as you saw in the tutorial, the function that handles the request and returns a response is called a 'view'
[10:04:02] <FunkyBob> no.. the template is the template
[10:04:18] <gcbirzan> This is starting to sound like a Monty Python sketch
[10:04:32] *** Joins: mattil (~mattil@airio.portalify.com)
[10:04:46] <FunkyBob> gcbirzan: it starts with the misconception that (a) Django is MVC, and (b) that any server-side web framework is MVC [i've yet to see one]
[10:05:20] <FunkyBob> people mix terminology from incompatible domains, and confusion ensues
[10:06:46] <asarch> But even Flask and TurboGears2…
[10:06:56] <FunkyBob> asarch: so typically a spinner like that is set and cleared by Javascript making requests
[10:07:03] <FunkyBob> asarch: yes, even them
[10:07:08] <FunkyBob> and rails, and all the rest
[10:07:39] *** Joins: shangxiao (~davids@101.181.108.207)
[10:07:43] <asarch> Anyway, how would you do that?
[10:07:46] <FunkyBob> because the 'view' (or controller as many call it) sits between t he model and the view... it's a Mediating controller, or Adapter from the MVA model
[10:07:54] <FunkyBob> asarch: you would do that with Javascript, as I said.
[10:08:25] <FunkyBob> you might render the page with the spinner already there, and clear it once the XHR/fetch requests to get the data completes
[10:08:45] <FunkyBob> but for a 'traditional' site where all the html rendering ahppens on teh server, its really not feasible
[10:09:12] <asarch> I see
[10:09:53] <FunkyBob> you need a trigger to show it, some action it's showing is 'happening', and a trigger to hide it
[10:12:45] <asarch> Thank you!

[13:13:34] <shangxiao> seems like a possibility
[13:14:09] <shangxiao> remind me again… why isn't aggregating the report on the server-side a thing?
[13:15:24] <pycode> shangxiao, i can do that but it if aggregate it on server side i only can use fixed period...i  mean...i can prepare 1 month report 3 months report and so on...but i cannot work on custom periods
[13:16:20] <shangxiao> why is it fixed? why can't there be a form to let the user to choose the period?
[13:17:55] <pycode> yes the user can choose the periods in a list that list has the pre-aggregated data, so he can choose 1/3/6/12 months periods but if he choose from 2021-01-01 to 2021-05-15 i need to calculate it
[13:18:07] <pycode> so i cannot just return the report i must calculate all the things for THAT Period
[13:18:18] <pycode> and calculating things means a lot of job
[13:18:38] <pycode> sql aggregation and other heavy job
[13:20:51] <pycode> shangxiao, to let you understand better the problem i mean that i need to privide a financial report, so from the period i need to calculate how many trades have been made during that period and then do analysis on their profit/loss
[13:21:18] <pycode> so basically the trades depend on the period i cannot "precalculate" the trades because they depends on period
[13:22:02] <pycode> if a trade starts from 2021-01-01 to 2021-01-10 and the user is asking me the report from 2021-01-05 i CANNOT do report on that trade because it starts from 2021-01-01
[13:22:09] <pycode> so for every period i need to do
[13:22:17] <pycode> 1. calculate the trades during that period
[13:22:29] <pycode> 2. get all the profit/loss/margin/balance
[13:22:34] <pycode> 3. do statistics
[13:22:42] <pycode> 4. return everything with a json
[13:22:59] <pycode> 5. build charts to show data (where the trades start/end too)
[13:23:01] <pycode> and so on..
[13:30:01] <knbk> pycode: what I've done in the past is calculate the necessary statistics on set periods with enough granularity, and save enough data to be able to combine statistics from multiple periods into one... but whether that's possible kinda depends on which statistics you need
[13:30:35] <knbk> e.g. if you need the mean, you just need the mean and count per period, then you can calculate the mean over multiple periods from that data
[13:34:14] <pycode> knbk, i understand it but in my case as i wrote i need to calculate the trades over a period, and then i need to do statistics over those trades, so the trades depend on period..and period depends on the user
[13:35:43] <pycode> i cannot precalculate trades because it has no fixed period for calculating trades it really depends from when the user want to test
[13:35:58] <pycode> it is a kind of backtesting tool knbk
[13:38:23] <knbk> say you precalculate statistics per day. Now the user asks for statstics from 2021-03-12 to 2021-04-12: you get all the precalculated stastics from that range and use them to calculate the overall statistics over that period. Is that not possible in your case? (I haven't seen the entire conversation, so I may be missing something)
[13:49:29] <pycode> knbk, i cannot summarize per day i give you an example
[13:50:43] <pycode> if you have a trade from 2021-01-01 to 2021-01-10 and the user asks for a range 2021-01-05 to 2021-01-28 you cannot select that trade because it starts in a previouly
[13:50:56] <pycode> starts 2021-01-01
[13:51:11] <pycode> so i cannot show the statistics using the data of that trade too
[13:51:27] <pycode> a trade can be multiday

[14:12:40] <pycode> knbk, how do you usually handle aggregations when the range falls during a period between dates?
[14:12:58] <pycode> i mean... if a trade A has a profit of 10$ from 2021-01-01 and 2021-01-10
[14:13:40] <pycode> and the user do a filter from 2021-01-05 or he wants monthly statistics (trades can have different from/to month)

[14:14:39] <carlio> @michelem: see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/default/#permission-caching - permissions and groups are cached and not even `reload_from_db` refreshes the cache, so you have to fetch the User object again
[14:15:22] <michelem> carlio: is that now what I do in Line 16 / 18 / 19 in the code I posted?
[14:15:54] <carlio> Yes, get the user, change the permissions, get it again if you need to read the new set of permissions

[14:18:14] <michelem> carlio: https://dpaste.org/yNBV Refetching the user does not seem to actually help. The Group stays in the set.

[14:18:55] <michelem> I suspect that I need to pass another type of value to remove(). That my Group(name=x) is purely a new instance, and doesn't actually fetch the existing group by that name in the DB
[14:19:29] <carlio> michelem: in line 5, you're creating a new group object and removing that, you're not referencing the value in the database table
[14:19:47] <carlio> you'd need to do `g = Group.objects.get(name='Abuser')` then `u.groups.remove(g)`
[14:19:58] <carlio> the one you create has no ID and isn't the same as the value that's already in the DB
[14:20:04] <carlio> sorry line 4 not 5
[14:20:50] <michelem> carlio: that's right. Thank you. That actually solves it
[14:21:15] <michelem> Would be great to add that one-liner to the documentation. There's no code snippet showing that, ATM.
[14:25:23] <knbk> pycode: if there's a standard way to handle this for the kind of trades you have, use that. Otherwise you just have to figure out what's reasonable

[14:50:32] <pycode> maybe i am wrong but what the point of using framework like vue an react for "normal" website  idk it seems like fashing to use such framework
[14:50:33] <pycode> no?
[14:50:53] <pycode> i mean ok they are both great but for SPA and advanced applications no?
[14:51:08] <pycode> i heard people that are using react for every project
[14:51:12] <pycode> bah
[14:52:25] <kezabelle> its a bit of both.
[14:53:27] <kezabelle> there's a fashion to it, because CVs and careers are incentivised to do so. It's a little bit a trend because everyone else is doing it, and it's a little bit common sense, because if not React or Vue, it's jQuery or mootools or prototype or whatever else we all used to circle around
[14:54:09] <kezabelle> Not everything needs a SPA, but a heck of a lot of things need 'something' for the small interactivities every site has.
[14:55:06] <shangxiao> Also… some folks want to try a technology because so they can learn about it in-depth and often jobs that use said technology require you have experience in it.
[14:55:18] <kezabelle> We all just circle our tribal wagons around Something for familiarity or appreciation or it being a good fit, etc
[14:55:53] <kezabelle> yeah, I should be off learning Elixir and Phoenix cos they look neat. But here I am staring at cProfile aghast at it's nonsense.
[14:57:12] <pycode> kezabelle, for small interactivities i just use plain js without jquery or other tools, but yes if we need more JS a framework is ok
[14:57:38] <pycode> yes for learning 100% right, companies are requiring it so ok
[14:57:53] <pycode> but starting every project with react sounds stupid to me
[14:58:47] <kezabelle> well, don't then. Leave everyone else to do as they like.
[14:59:01] <kezabelle> They're either all stupid, or you're missing something, or both :)

[14:59:49] <FunkyBob> using react for $DAYJOB... I can see the appeal.. but.. yeah
[15:01:06] <pycode> i think old and plain js works good too :D but yes i can understand that for some project a framework is better
[15:01:12] <pycode> never used svelte too
[15:01:23] <FunkyBob> new and plain JS is far better than old and plain JS...
[15:01:28] <kezabelle> svelte still looks neat from afar, but IDK, it stills seems somewhat schizophrenic. Sapper got replaced by sveltekit, etc
[15:01:43] <pycode> ahaha yes FunkyBob

[15:04:15] <FunkyBob> i've not looked closely at tailwind yet
[15:04:19] <kezabelle> Perpetually in a state of confusion about them, because lol they don't make sense to me except I've worked on enough big projects that they totally make sense.
[15:04:25] <FunkyBob> we use css-in-js in a couple of ways and... hrm
[15:04:47] <FunkyBob> oh, and with vars in CSS now... and soon maybe nesting too?  that's nice to see
[15:05:22] <kezabelle> nesting?
[15:05:25] <kezabelle> nesting of what?
[15:05:47] <FunkyBob> like scss nesting
[15:05:50] <kezabelle> oh right

[15:11:22] <pycode> but i would like if i can reduce it more
[15:13:31] <kezabelle> well you could write your own json_script to pass through indent/separators stuff
[15:13:45] <kezabelle> but realistically you won't see a substantial difference if you're also going to gzip it.
[15:13:57] <pycode> ok
[15:14:29] <pycode> kezabelle, on moment should i configure gzip on nginx only right? i mean there is nothing to configure on django side

[18:09:14] <kezabelle> nah you can modify it in clean, s'fine
[18:09:37] <kezabelle> whole point of clean is to massage and/or validate

[18:10:05] <pycode1> okay thanks
[18:10:10] <pycode1> "massage" :D
[18:12:02] <kezabelle> interesting that it's not _really_ mentioned in the docs
[18:12:10] <kezabelle> [for form cleaning/validation, anyway]
[18:12:27] <kezabelle> beyond a cursory mention that the return value will replace the value in cleaned_data
[18:13:50] <pycode1> so if i do cleaned_data = super().clean()
[18:13:57] <pycode1> and then cleaned_data['field'] = 'bla'
[18:14:00] <pycode1> it is ok
[18:14:09] <kezabelle> sure
[18:14:59] <kezabelle> it's just a dict at the end of the day. You can add/remove things as you like, as long as anything that then tries to _use_ the cleaned data knows what to do
[18:15:09] <pycode1> kezabelle, just one more question but in this case we are talking about BOUNDED form
[18:15:19] <pycode1> what about i have to show a default value ?
[18:15:34] <pycode1> because i put validation so if the user put an empty field he will get the error

[18:16:36] <pycode1> i thought about field.initial because as i wrote i cannot pass the initial because using django-forms when i declare a filterset i can put the class of the form, but just the class i cannot inizialize it passing the initial

[18:21:32] <kezabelle> shangxiao: nah it's actually super cool if you can afford to do it, because any db dump intrinsically brings the files with it.
[18:21:48] <kezabelle> doesn't necessarily scale _super_ well, but then what does? :)
[18:21:53] <shangxiao> Exactly :) plus transactions
[18:22:09] <fleabag> imo anything is fair game for PoCs
[18:22:12] <shangxiao> yep I mean most stuff I work on will never really scale anyway

[18:24:56] <kezabelle> if you're at the point where you've got a whole custom form, just do the work in LogicsForm.__init__ and do self.fields['date_form'].initial = ???
[18:25:21] <pycode1> ok
[18:25:27] <kezabelle> presumably you're not init'ing the Form class yourself, and it's behind the .form accessor in your filterset or something?
[18:27:12] <pycode1> kezabelle, i have a filterset and i do https://bpa.st/F34A
[18:27:36] <pycode1> i cannot initialize the form class directly (if yes i can pass the initial) but i must set the class only without initializing
[18:27:48] <pycode1> https://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ref/filterset.html#custom-forms-using-form
[18:28:17] <pycode1> i can set it in Meta too but it is just the class
[18:28:19] <pycode1> not the instance
[18:29:11] <kezabelle> yeah so what I said, do it in the form's init
[18:29:44] <kezabelle> or change the filterset to accept initial, and change the form property to fill it
[18:30:29] <pycode1> kezabelle, or...or....or... instead of doing that i can replace self.request.GET with the self.request.GET adding 'from', 'to'
[18:30:31] <kezabelle> kinda wonder why filterset doesn't accept initial. weird.
[18:30:46] <pycode1> ad the moment i do
[18:30:47] <pycode1> context['filter'] = LogicsFilter(self.request.GET, queryset=self.get_logics_queryset())
[18:30:56] <kezabelle> well sure, if you mutate the incoming QueryDict, you can stuff whatever you like in there.
[18:30:57] <pycode1> instesd of passing self.request.GET
[18:31:09] <kezabelle> but that will force it to be bound
[18:31:22] <pycode1> kezabelle, they are saying this: https://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/main/guide/tips.html#using-initial-values-as-defaults
[18:31:49] <pycode1> kezabelle, yes yes like the user sent it no problem
[18:31:58] <pycode1> it is the default filter then the user can change the range
[18:32:02] <pycode1> but i need a default range
[18:32:39] <pycode1> i was looking the validators list, how is that possible there is no Date validator?
[18:33:04] <pycode1> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/validators/#built-in-validators
[18:33:14] <kezabelle> because it lives on the field directly
[18:33:45] <pycode1> ah ok so i do not need to specify it
[18:33:45] <pycode1> ok
[18:33:49] <pycode1> makes sense
[18:33:51] <pycode1> :)
[18:41:32] <pycode1> kezabelle, https://bpa.st/LCFA
[18:41:51] <pycode1> ops i forgot to return data
[18:41:54] <pycode1> at the end
[18:42:01] <pycode1> btw that's what i mean
[18:45:24] <pycode1> https://bpa.st/R3DQ better :)
[18:47:45] <kezabelle> sure that'd work
[18:48:18] <kezabelle> presuming that submitting from OR to isn't a valid combination with an empty for the other

[19:10:48] *** Joins: jmft2 (~JMFT@82.3.54.26)
[19:30:22] <jmft2> Is it possible for a model class to have a method whose name is the same as the name of another model class? Say I have models Foo and Bar that have a one-to-one relationship. It seems like calling the method foo.bar() will try to resolve an object of class Bar and then raise TypeError because it's not callable; or raise RelatedObjectDoesNotExist.
[19:34:37] <jmft2> Workaround is to rename the method
[19:38:15] <knbk> jmft2: I'm assuming Bar contains the OneToOneField? You can set the related_name in the field to rename the attribute on Foo
[19:39:13] <jmft2> Thanks!

[20:07:23] <MapMan> Hi! I'm dealing with a weird issue where SOMETIMES foreign key relation is not persisted in the database while everything else is. Check this simple snippet: https://dpaste.org/Mv6k - 95% of the time this works as intended. 5% of the time (I can't repro) the request is created, the visit is also in the system, but `visit.check_in_request` is None. Any ideas?
[20:17:13] <knbk> MapMan: any exceptions? or concurrent updates that could overwrite the check_in_request? where/how is this code called?
[20:20:27] <MapMan> knbk: No exceptions reported, logs show that everything succeeded. No concurrency afaik. The code is invoked from your standard `form_valid`.

[20:23:31] <MapMan> knbk: I stand corrected, there could be some concurrency. I'll investigate that since that's the most obvious candidate.
[20:30:58] <MapMan> knbk: yup, I think I found the place. Got a regression during merging, there was indeed a race. Thanks for putting me on the right track!
