[06:07:56] <tpefreedom> hello [itchyjunk] 
[06:08:36] <[itchyjunk]> I read this article which i thought was interesting.
[06:08:39] <[itchyjunk]> https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/campaign-shut-down-crucial-documentary-tool-youtube-dl-continues-and-so-does-fight
[06:09:08] <[itchyjunk]> Idk if it's on topic here or not. But seems important.
[06:09:33] <[itchyjunk]> Since free software could also be impacted if a court ever rules against things like youtube-dl, no?

[07:52:06] <tpefreedom> I notice that GNU says this about the QPL: "This is a non-copyleft free software license which is incompatible with the GNU GPL. It also causes major practical inconvenience, because modified sources can only be distributed as patches. We recommend that you avoid using the QPL for anything that you write, and use QPL-covered software packages only when absolutely necessary. However, this avoidance no longer applies to Qt itself, 
[07:52:06] <tpefreedom> since Qt is now also released under the GNU GPL."
[07:53:07] <tpefreedom> Free software license but GNU still recommends avoiding using programs under it?
[07:54:42] <jxself> They recommend not using putting the QPL on your own programs. And to "use QPL-covered software packages only when absolutely necessary."
[07:55:04] *** Quits: frostsnow (~frostsnow@c-73-25-106-78.hsd1.or.comcast.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[07:55:25] <jxself> Because of that problem, it seems, where your modified version of the program can only be distributed in the form of a patch.
[07:55:37] <jxself> Not the actual modified program itself. But the original and your patch.
[07:56:22] <jxself> And your patch might grow into patches. And maybe large patches.
[07:56:26] <tpefreedom> So more specifically as a dependency/in development?
[07:56:39] <jxself> Since you can never distribute the whole thing as a single thing.
[07:57:26] <jxself> I'm not sure I understand the question.
[07:59:36] *** Joins: frostsnow (~frostsnow@c-73-25-106-78.hsd1.or.comcast.net)
[07:59:40] <tpefreedom> Is the "...and use QPL-covered software packages only when absolutely necessary." part aimed more at the general public or more at developers/programmers in particular?
[08:00:04] <jxself> Everyone?
[08:01:01] <jxself> I imagine that the intention is not try to avoid spreading software under the QPL so that the license, and the practical inconvenience caused by it, doesn't spread and become more popular and create more problems for more people.
[08:01:18] <jxself> er; is to try to avoid...
[08:04:13] <tpefreedom> Has anyone tried to get ITS fsf/gnu certified?
[08:04:35] <tpefreedom> or a version of it?
[08:04:45] <jxself> I have not heard of such a thing happening.
[08:06:06] <tpefreedom> but afaik isn't it fully free/libre?
[08:07:48] <tpefreedom> maybe it's so old no one cares enough either way to think about it
[08:08:25] <jxself> MIT released parts of ITS under the GPL back in, I think, 1999.
[08:08:51] <jxself> http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/ftpdir/its/
[08:10:31] <jxself> But, of course, with something with such a long history going back into 1967 it's probably more complicated than that.
[08:12:08] <jxself> There may be an argument ITS is actually in the public domain in the United States and MIT had no copyright to licensed under the GPL in the first place.
[08:12:19] <jxself> Given the long history and it predated the US's implementation of automatic copyright that started in 1989.
[08:12:58] <jxself> And that ITS didn't have any copyright notices anywhere.
[08:13:17] <jxself> And so then I point to https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/publicdomain

[08:16:56] <tpefreedom> if it was originally under public domain, wouldn't the GPL just apply to that specific its distribution?
[08:17:35] <jxself> You need to have a copyright in order to license it. The GPL, and all free software licenses, rely on the copyright holder's ability to license.

[08:18:23] <jxself> The only difference is that the license notice may be invalid and it may properly be public domain. But it's safer to follow the GPL in any case.
[08:21:23] <tpefreedom> So in practice the GPL might only mean anything in the case of modifications to a program in the public domain?
[08:22:15] <jxself> You can make modifications to a public domain program & put your changes under the GPL.

[20:32:29] <jxself> Decentralized services will be even more important at that point.
[20:33:11] <kompowiec2> but what will it do if you are physically cut off from the transit relays?
[20:33:24] <jxself> In such a scenario I can imagine people near borders setting up mesh networks with people in the other country in order to communicate. That would then let people continue with inter-country comunication.
[20:33:52] <jxself> I'm imagining long-range directional antenna which can go for miles and not necessarily even be noticed.
[20:34:03] <kompowiec2> ie again, back to square one, learning ham radio
[20:34:17] <jxself> There is also satellite access too.
[20:35:07] <kompowiec2> not to mention that it's very expensive
[20:35:17] <jxself> Humans existed and communicated before the internet existed. We'd continue to do so if it's gone.
[20:36:14] <jxself> But I still place some credit in the ingenuity of people to come up with ways to continue.
[20:36:37] <kompowiec2> i think that paradoxically best option will be phones, in 2010 in egipt, they used france relay when they were cut off from the internet
[20:37:35] <kompowiec2> this is the probably only service the government would not want to cut off

[21:33:46] <stupidgenius> Stable as in "horse" or stable as in "steady"...probably neither. ;-)
[21:34:03] <devinu> DarrenAbramson: since you are here, maybe you could talk about your paper first? Perhaps a summary?
[21:35:14] <DarrenAbramson> Sure thing -- my co-author and I have published some work on common sense judgements by language models. Our central concern is that the productization of Copilot hides sub-optimal scientific decisions.
[21:35:53] <stupidgenius> Is there a quick, simple example?
[21:36:20] <devinu> because no one, other than GitHub developers, can see the ML algorithm? DarrenAbramson
[21:36:35] <DarrenAbramson> sure -- natural language is full of ambiguities that human speakers barely notice. For example: "The trophy couldn't fit in the suitcase because it was too big."
[21:36:47] <DarrenAbramson> Most language speakers will know immediately what "it" refers to.
[21:36:51] <devinu> (please correct me at any time if I am incorrect)
[21:37:52] <DarrenAbramson> We do know a lot about the ML algorithm from OpenAI's publications. Paraphrasing, they acknowledge that their algorithm is inferior at the task I just posted than others, but productized it because of their prior investment.
[21:38:05] <eddievanhacker> @devinu and maybe just a little group of them
[21:38:35] <eddievanhacker> ?
[21:38:39] <stupidgenius> In what way does CP hide that?  Is it because the algo makes a decision, but doesn't disclose the role of interpreting the "it" (in your example)?

[21:39:06] <DarrenAbramson> From pg. 33 of the GPT3 paper: "Thus our design decision comes at the cost of potentially worse performance on tasks which empirically benefit from bidirectionality. This may include fill-in-the-blank tasks, tasks that involve looking back and comparing two pieces of content, or tasks that require re-reading or carefully considering a long passage
[21:39:06] <DarrenAbramson> and then generating a very short answer. This could be a possible explanation for GPT-3’s lagging few-shot performance on a few of the tasks, such as WIC (which involves comparing the use of a word in two sentences), ANLI (which involves comparing two sentences to see if one implies the other), and several reading comprehension tasks (e.g. QuAC
[21:39:07] <DarrenAbramson> and RACE). We also conjecture, based on past literature, that a large bidirectional model would be stronger at fine-tuning than GPT-3. Making a bidirectional model at the scale of GPT-3, and/or trying to make bidirectional models work with few- or zero-shot learning, is a promising direction for future research, and could help achieve the “best
[21:39:07] <DarrenAbramson> of both worlds”."
[21:39:41] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[21:39:44] <DarrenAbramson> But, a lot was spent on building that model -- so copilot in my view is an attempt to recoup investment while acknowledging basic weaknesses on language understanding compared to other approaches.

[21:41:12] <DarrenAbramson> stupidgenius maybe "hides" was a bit strong; I just meant that the model can't be probed directly by someone who wants to check if it understands anything. This is a concern because the published results on disambiguating pronouns are disappointing.

[21:42:07] <DarrenAbramson> devinu exactly
[21:42:40] <DarrenAbramson> I've seen many funny cases of copilot in which it uses cascading if/then blocks -- I wonder if this is related.
[21:43:01] <kompowiec2> Pretty Little Girls' School ;)
[21:43:04] <DarrenAbramson> But that also is related to the issues raised by the other authors, that the model makes heavy use of other people's (good or bad) code.

[21:48:59] <DarrenAbramson> Copilot appears to me to be motivated by an attempt to monetize a series of private research decisions, rather than produce the best model.

[21:53:30] <DarrenAbramson> yes -- if the model meets customers demands, then indeed it is a better product. We question though that if a model is bad at understanding a single sentence
[21:53:42] <DarrenAbramson> 's pronoun, it is likely to be less good at understanding a docstring.

[21:58:27] <stupidgenius> DarrenAbramson could you discuss that a bit more?  On its surface, pronouns/gender/etc seems MUCH more nuanced (ie. difficult to parse) than a docstring.

[22:06:04] <devinu> DarrenAbramson: Is the person in that video just, like, pressing TAB to get all that output (including the license)?
[22:06:16] <DarrenAbramson> devinu yes that is my understanding
[22:06:34] <devinu> wow
[22:06:46] <DarrenAbramson> Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate, and cherry picked examples tell us very little about what a model is doing.
[22:07:16] <stupidgenius> I was also unclear on the context of that video.  What is the concern?  What is being "leaked"?
[22:07:18] <DarrenAbramson> I guess on the good and bad side of evaluation -- both that video, but also the impressive examples out there.
[22:07:25] <iank> arrenAbramson, just want to say that I really enjoyed your paper, i think it shed a lot of light on the situation. One big takeaway is that really useful to know that big proprietary models are not all they are cracked up to be.
[22:07:42] <DarrenAbramson> stupidgenius what is being leaked is verbatim parts of the training corpus
[22:07:58] <DarrenAbramson> iank thank you
[22:08:01] <devinu> DarrenAbramson: yes
[22:08:17] <devinu> I suppose GitHub will probably refine the tool to avoid that sort of regurgitation as it seems to imply copyright infringement. Does anyone know if they have changed it yet?
[22:10:16] <stupidgenius> I feel like I'm missing something still.  So, it's just regurgitating some of its training data.  What is the critique?  Is it that the tool is just an automated cut and paste?  Or something deeper, more subtle that I'm missing?
[22:10:45] <devinu> I am by no means a very skilled coder, but when I do create a script, I usually start with an outline of the structure and then fill in the details, not going line-by-line as I see in this video.
[22:11:24] <DarrenAbramson> stupidgenius the product is offered as "artificial intelligence": a pair programmer that understands what you're trying to do, and offers helpful suggestions. Our critique is that the evidence it understands anything, let alone what you're trying to do, is very weak.

[22:12:46] <DarrenAbramson> Here's an old article that mentions the FSF call for papers. Notice Brockman's claim that it can do just about any language task: https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2021/08/11/openai-api.aspx
[22:13:10] <DarrenAbramson> Not even the GPT-3 paper has that kind of unjustified hubris.
[22:13:43] <devinu> DarrenAbramson: Any thoughts on the implications for education? I know its not specifically addressed in your paper, but a lot of students use visual studio, and may be tempted to use Copilot to create code (for classes etc.)
[22:13:45] <devinu> ?
[22:14:15] <thomzane> DarrenAbramson: There are AI code generators put out by EleutherAI that are licensed under free licenses such as GPT-Neo, GPT-J, and GPT-NeoX that are also trained on GitHub.  How do you feel about these models?  Do you know how they compare with regard to language comprehension?
[22:15:05] <DarrenAbramson> Education is in a funny state. I just heard a story about students illicitly sharing answers for professional account exams, or similar. I'm still a believer in memorization and testing, but it's getting harder and harder to enforce standards.

The research community seems to me to be turning in that direction.
