[20:23:37] <icrbow[m]> <sm> "is the content repo public ?" <- https://gitlab.com/dpwiz/haskell-game.dev
[20:26:09] <icrbow[m]> I was thinking about moving to (ugh) github, under the haskell-game group. But it would require updating all the "pages" infra... And I personally don't like pouring even more network effects on the github wheel.
[20:29:14] <sm> ic.rbow: I hear you, and I don't say it's the only way, but it would certainly accelerate making this a community-contributed/maintained site, if you want that
[20:29:38] <sm> but gitlab is not too bad either
[20:29:47] <sm> a public repo is the main thing
[20:30:11] <ManofLetters[m]> actually how active/responsive is github's haskell-game?
[20:30:32] <sm> it's not active, but it's a good existing central place for such things
[20:31:14] <ManofLetters[m]> right
[20:31:25] <ManofLetters[m]> but I'm worried any request might take a long time
[20:31:54] <ManofLetters[m]> I think some of these esteemed devs are the same that maintain sdl2...
[20:32:38] <sm> it looks like I have owner access there, and lots of others do
[20:32:57] <sm> maybe some of them still lurk here (ocharles ?)
[20:33:07] <icrbow[m]> ManofLetters[m]: I have the access now, so it can be as active as I want it to be (=
[20:33:38] <icrbow[m]> I did some sdl2 clean up recently and do regular updates on dear-imgui.
[20:34:10] <sm> nice..  released yet ?
[20:34:20] <sm> are there games using dear-imgui ?
[20:34:41] <icrbow[m]> sdl2 no, I don't have upload rights. dear-imgui yes, 1.3.0 out today.
[20:35:58] <icrbow[m]> sm: I made one for a recent LD. It looks... okay.

[20:38:15] <sm> more options for hs game dev is good
[20:42:20] <ManofLetters[m]> I'm mentioning sdl2, because it doesn't work with GHC 9.2.1 and at some point it's going to be a problem
[20:47:09] <icrbow[m]> <sm> "yay, got a link ?" <- https://gitlab.com/dpwiz/swerve
[20:47:12] <sm> I think sdl2 is not getting used enough to be actively maintained.. right ?
[20:47:44] <EvanR> hmm is that the actual direction of causality
[20:48:02] <EvanR> and not "not maintained, won't use"
[20:48:12] <icrbow[m]> I don't think there is one...
[20:49:18] <icrbow[m]> It just works. Until it doesn't (:
[20:49:27] <sm> swerve https://youtu.be/aZbQ7wMvlpM is beautiful, congrats
[20:49:43] <sm> it goes both ways I think EvanR
[20:50:14] <EvanR> granted "not maintained, won't use" is often silly
[20:50:53] <EvanR> but for sdl2 may be smart
[20:51:39] <sm> I think one reason sdl2 isn't used more is the pain of installing cross platform
[20:52:01] <sm> opengl based libs are easier
[20:52:05] <EvanR> what does installing cross platform mean here
[20:52:28] <EvanR> for development?
[20:52:33] <sm> windows users building your app (& mac, etc.)
[20:52:38] *** Joins: x88x88x (~x88x88x@149.28.53.172)
[20:52:51] <EvanR> users... building your app... on windows / mac
[20:53:17] <sm> most projects don't have the resources to ship good binaries for all platforms, so typically your player/potential contributor base is building your game
[20:53:18] <EvanR> it's usually a capital bitch and a half regardless of what app it is
[20:53:33] <EvanR> which is why users need precompiled binaries for those platforms
[20:53:42] <sm> even if you make a windows binary, is ensuring sdl libs easy ? not sure
[20:53:54] <EvanR> yeah it's pretty easy
[20:54:14] <EvanR> and mac has the whole bundling dylibs thing
[20:54:14] <sm> it's at least enough hassle that we don't see it happen much
[20:54:32] <ManofLetters[m]> sm: sdl2 is opengl based, deep under the hood
[20:54:41] * sm tries to think of haskell games that have truly ready to run binaries for three platforms
[20:54:43] <EvanR> yes open source projects might expect people on windows to build their code
[20:55:07] <EvanR> for end user purposes
[20:55:27] <EvanR> but in not haskell game, I think binaries are more common
[20:55:35] <sm> EvanR yes I'm mostly assuming small/indie games here, since we don't have a commercial haskell games scene
[20:55:59] <EvanR> i don't see the connection between compiling a binary and having commercial resources
[20:56:18] <sm> * assuming small/indie (haskell) games here,
[20:56:48] <sm> EvanR, how many graphical foss projects ship good binaries for three platforms ? not so many
[20:57:02] <EvanR> the humble exe file and maybe dlls in the zip... a classic method of delivering your no-name broke ass program xD
[20:57:10] <sm> it costs time and multiplatform expertise
[20:57:22] <EvanR> good binary, for three platforms?
[20:58:03] <sm> good binary: a binary you download and it just works. three platforms: windows, mac, gnu/linux
[20:58:04] <EvanR> if windows is supported at all, you have an exe file somewhere. On linux people build from source out of habit anyway
[20:58:33] <EvanR> OSX, that's another story but the workflow is pretty standardized
[20:58:43] <EvanR> and yeah you'd wait for a big release
[20:59:09] <EvanR> mainly, I think exe file in a zip is very common for not commercial big budget programs 
[20:59:15] <ManofLetters[m]> for Windows it's rather easy via CI, but I can't be bothered to set it up for MacOS --- a bit blow was Travis demise
[20:59:45] <ManofLetters[m]> I mean each nightly can have all 3 binaries bundled with zip
[20:59:53] <ManofLetters[m]> once you set up the pipeline, no problem at al
[21:00:14] <ManofLetters[m]> but a pain when your CI of choice dies or libs change and stuff breaks
[21:00:24] <EvanR> need CI for CI
[21:00:28] <ManofLetters[m]> (e.g., the libs that you have to include in zip change)
