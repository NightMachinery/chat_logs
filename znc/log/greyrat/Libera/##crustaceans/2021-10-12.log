[00:05:04] <dimadima> (erm, "Twatter")
[00:05:44] <dimadima> while trying to do link previews for my own thing, i learned that you can get twitter to return HTML with meta tags (vs their SPA) if you send the same UA as iMessage
[00:06:16] <dimadima> i'm guessing they will forever be forced to support sending HTML for iMessage
[00:06:48] <dimadima> guessing daily volume for buttsbot isn't an issue though
[00:09:50] <dimadima> it is nice that the current UA is "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) Buttsbot link-previews"
[00:15:59] <imode> so I have... variable length (unary), variable length (binary), fixed length (binary).. I don't think you can use fixed length unary or it wouldn't be useful. I could have my IR tackle all of these cases.

[04:42:53] <companion_cube> the witness, too
[04:43:02] <gwozniak> I have little exposure to him, but it's clear he loves himself
[04:43:08] <companion_cube> maybe he makes good games, but he's also very arrogant
[04:43:17] <companion_cube> and believes he knows about everything
[04:44:30] <drakonis> well, that's accurate
[04:44:36] <drakonis> you should see him on a podcast
[04:44:47] <companion_cube> well he's predicted the end of civilization
[04:44:58] <companion_cube> and apparently is an expert on covid lab leaks?

[05:57:15] <companion_cube> is that on switch too? :)
[05:58:13] <ngoldbaum> yeah it’s a nintendo game
[05:58:42] <ngoldbaum> it runs reasonably well too
[05:58:52] <ngoldbaum> although the cutscenes look like shit for some reason
[05:59:18] <ngoldbaum> the boss fights are hard
[06:06:10] <imode> fuck that one emmi.
[06:19:55] <drakonis> time to emulate me some metroid dread........
[06:20:07] <drakonis> ngoldbaum: its not a metroidvania, its a ~~metroid~~ game
[06:20:13] <drakonis> harumph
[06:37:11] <companion_cube> is that the latest metroid? heh
[06:37:54] <imode> yup.
[06:38:07] <imode> we've come a long way from SNES emulation.
[06:38:17] <imode> dread runs.. mostly out of the box on yuzu.
[06:38:19] <companion_cube> I find my taste in games is getting more demanding :/
[06:38:25] <companion_cube> as I play less, for lack of time
[06:38:41] <companion_cube> HK was awesome, so waiting for their next game might be a safe plan :)
[06:40:43] <imode> hollow knight?
[06:40:49] <companion_cube> ja
[06:41:06] <imode> that game was my shit.
[06:41:11] <companion_cube> how far did you go?
[06:41:15] <imode> all the way.
[06:41:31] <imode> path. of. pain.
[06:41:34] <companion_cube> like the 112% completion?
[06:41:41] <companion_cube> lol I hear it's terrible
[06:41:48] <imode> paaaaaaaaain.
[06:42:03] <companion_cube> I've done 3/5 endings and I don't think I can go much further
[06:42:37] <imode> I haven't played the gods DLC.
[06:42:42] <imode> but I have a feeling I will later.
[06:42:56] <imode> the soundtrack is remarkable.
[06:42:57] <companion_cube> have you destroyed radiance?
[06:43:01] <companion_cube> yes the music is A+++
[06:43:10] <imode> yup.
[06:43:20] <imode> m0th.
[06:43:32] <companion_cube> the gods DLC is apparently another level of crazy difficulty
[06:44:00] <imode> I'm not a pain slut, I like immersive worlds.
[06:44:04] <imode> not difficult challenges.
[06:44:08] <imode> which is why dread was uh, lackluster.
[06:44:22] <companion_cube> and HK is awesome in this respect
[06:44:34] <companion_cube> silk song seems like it'll be even better
[06:44:47] <imode> team cherry can take to the heat death of the universe with it.

[07:43:14] <dimadima> i want to get into rss
[07:43:56] * dimadima looks at tt_rss
[07:43:59] * dimadima is on macos though
[07:48:51] <drakonis> fuckin wow
[07:48:56] <drakonis> well, that's annoying

[07:59:26] <dimadima> i like its tagline at the end "There’s no warranty. If it breaks you get to keep both parts."
[08:07:56] <cb> the tt-rss dev is a chode and mandating docker
[08:07:59] <cb> so im tempted to switch
[08:08:01] <cb> idk to what tho
[08:13:16] <indigo> Miniflux is one that looks like lobsters
[08:13:40] <cb> my problem is i like the rss reader layout bc making it look like a news aggregator is tricky
[08:23:05] <dimadima> cb: you say chode like it's a bad thing
[08:23:28] <dimadima> hey also, you mean docker for builds or docker for runnnnning it?
[08:25:04] <dimadima> docker for running an rss app seems... weird
[08:25:15] <dimadima> can't it just update when its running

[18:06:04] <dcz_> sadly I can't remember most of the places that I interacted only in person but I'm not expecting they would be helpful since 1. there's no formal account , 2. businesses must keep invoices for some time
[18:11:16] <imode> allo everyone.
[18:11:44] <companion_cube> o/
[18:12:15] <kline> 15:18 <dimadima> is UK still party to things like GDPR
[18:12:15] <imode> how's everything.
[18:12:16] <kline> yes
[18:12:29] <kline> EU decisions dont usually take action on their own
[18:12:55] <kline> they are usually requirements for member nations to incorporate equivalent/compliant legislation that fits their own system
[18:13:16] <kline> so there is a uk gdpr act that is our implementation of the eu mandated system
[18:13:19] <kline> this has not been repealed
[18:13:31] <kline> 15:18 <dimadima> isn't going to court a ... big deal?
[18:13:43] <kline> criminal court maybe but small claims court is less of a big deal, being for small claims
[18:14:04] <imode> are you the injured party in this GDPR court visit.
[18:14:26] <kline> yeah, my isp is witholding my user information as im using it in a complaint against them
[18:14:33] <imode> oh lovely.
[18:14:35] <imode> kick their balls in.
[18:14:48] <dcz_> does the GDPR let you file complaints at any regulator, or only the one where the offender is?
[18:14:52] <kline> (ok, i dont _know_ thats why theyre doing it, but theres only so many times you can apologise, tell me itll be done this week, and then not)
[18:15:06] <dcz_> I guess it's the one where you live actually
[18:15:52] <kline> problem mostly is that i dont know how to actually bring it against them
[18:16:16] <dcz_> isn't that a matter of finding a complaint form?
[18:16:24] <kline> small claims is ez for things like "i bought a £50 lawnmower from x and it turned out to be broken"
[18:17:00] <imode> the real question is... is it gonna be easy for this.
[18:17:11] <imode> are the courts even aware of how to deal with this appropriately.
[18:17:14] <dcz_> oh, I'd have gone directly to the regulator to complain, not to court
[18:18:32] <dcz_> https://noyb.eu/en those folks probably know how exactly to approach this
[18:18:32] <buttsbot> My Privacy is None of Your Business
[18:23:52] <kline> imode, dont care, they have a monopoly contract where i live and i want to present it as a reason to end the contract
[18:23:54] <dimadima> imode: good morning
[18:24:02] <dimadima> kline: yes, get 'em
[18:24:21] <dimadima> so GDPR is small claims unless it gets kicked up higher?
[18:24:37] <imode> kline: fight that good fight.
[18:25:27] <dimadima> "< imode> are the courts even aware of how to deal with this appropriately." that's what i wonder. how many small claims non-specialized judges are trained for or have experience in this
[18:27:31] <dimadima> dcz_: you're in germany, right? you can go directly to the regulator and it's effective?
[18:28:02] <dimadima> they are hiring lawyers https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-hiring-gdpr-lawyers-and-full-stack-developers
[18:28:02] <buttsbot> noyb is hiring GDPR lawyers and full stack developers!

[18:33:09] <dcz_> and yes, it's Germany. did I lose my cloak?
[18:39:00] <imode> why do people enjoy squid game.
[18:40:51] <imode> y'know what, I don't want an answer to that, I assume it's depressing.
[18:47:26] <dimadima> dcz_: no you mentioned it when we were discussing mailboxes
[18:47:57] <dimadima> sorry i didn't mean to uncloak, just assumed it was ok cause you'd mentioned it :/
[18:49:32] <dcz_> I mentioned Europe :) also it's not a secret
[18:49:58] <dimadima> then i must have made up germany some how. it looms over europe :)
[18:50:28] <dcz_> extrasensory perception
[18:51:58] <gwozniak> dcz_: a few years ago I went through and cleaned up all kinds of accounts I had created.  In a lot of cases the site was just gone, but forum sites were the worst, aside from IBM and Adobe
[18:52:02] <dimadima> imode: i've heard squid game is violent and stuff, but that's all i know and i've been enjoying pretending it's a hibachi seafood cooking show
[18:52:21] <imode> dimadima: that... makes every conversation about it a little better.
[18:52:29] <dimadima> gwozniak: worst in what way
[18:52:34] <imode> if only everyone was this enthusiastically into cooking.
[18:52:48] <dcz_> thankfully few forums have anything identifiable on me
[18:53:10] <gwozniak> dimadima: you couldn't delete an account without getting in touch with an admin, who then just deleted when you asked
[18:53:59] <dimadima> ah
[18:54:10] <gwozniak> I kept my Slashdot account, tho. Over 20 years old at this point
[18:54:30] <dimadima> imode: i don't want to misrepresent how much into cooking i am. i'm mostly utilitarian when it comes to eating. just fill me up
[18:54:36] <gwozniak> Although I haven't used it in about that long
[18:55:55] <imode> what's the oldest account I own...
[18:56:00] <imode> probably my yahoo mail account.
[18:56:01] <dimadima> imode: i prefer alternate show reality. like for a long time i thought "degrassi" was a cop show
[18:56:13] <dcz_> slashdot still exists? it's as if someone told me Hercules was alive
[18:56:17] <dimadima> was sad when someone ruined that for me
[18:56:32] <dimadima> hahaha yeahi went to slashdot the other day when tired tired tried of HN
[18:56:44] <dimadima> there was some decent stuff on there. but of course much overlap with HN :/
[18:57:36] <Geekingfrog> It would be "interesting" to have a site which, before you can post something, checks if it's already posted in some other popular forums, and if yes, prevent the submission
[18:57:54] <Geekingfrog> I wonder what kind of stuff would end up there
[18:58:06] <dimadima> Geekingfrog: i thought about that, but what if you post it, and then it's posted to those other sites?
[18:58:42] <Geekingfrog> Then it's fine? Ofc it can be gamed and such, but I suppose that would avoid a lot of cross-posting
[18:58:54] <imode> I don't think we need more unification of the grand chaos that is "everything else", small communities need to be small for the health of the internet.
[18:58:55] <Geekingfrog> Until that hypothetical site becomes popular, and then people do post there first
[18:59:09] <imode> otherwise you're just recreating facebook with a time delay.
[18:59:37] <dimadima> that's my bread and butter
[19:01:02] <Geekingfrog> I wondered if there was something like a newsfeed, but with a 1 week delay, and some auto-purging for expired content.
[19:01:23] <Geekingfrog> And then realised that I don't really care that much about news in general so 🤷‍♂️
[19:03:14] <imode> the water source analogy made sense to me. facebook and other giant feed sites are like putting your head under the crushing weight of a waterfall, eventually you'll fall in and become part of the stream. small communities are like streams, medium-sized like rivers.
[19:12:06] <dimadima> the question is whether it's possbile to build a community/platform without optimizing for engagement
[19:12:32] <dimadima> given all the other platforms/mediums out there optimizing for engagement
[19:13:13] <imode> lobste.rs did it.
[19:15:14] <dimadima> lobste.rs is gameified with points, which helps, and is a public forum where people can, if they want, indulge it vanity and identity building (not saying those are bad, per se). but lobste.rs also, to my knowledge, doesn't need to generate profit
[19:15:41] <dimadima> i'm thinking something more consumery, and without gameification
[19:16:14] <imode> communities form around things to do. the thing to do on lobste.rs is share and comment on content from around the web.
[19:16:47] <imode> there's two possible paths for that.
[19:17:32] <imode> one is to optimize for engagement, which is minimal effort for maximum usershare: you exploit certain things about human psychology and shuffle what everyone's looking at so they stay reading, sharing, commenting, etc.
[19:19:24] <imode> the other is to make the "thing(s) to do" more interesting and engaging, which is more effort for a potentially minimal increase in usershare: if users on lobste.rs could, for example, not only share stories but also jump into a collaborative programming/wiki environment to share more in-depth commentary or demonstrations, that's inherently more interesting than just serving up a comment feed
[19:19:26] <imode> with karma attached to it.
[19:19:55] <imode> because there are more avenues for creation/expression.
[19:20:09] <imode> but, again, that's the harder thing to do.
[19:22:46] <dimadima> thank you that's not something i've thought about like that
[19:24:12] <dimadima> imode: what do you think is more important from a platform? or what do you think people, generally, are looking for more: "creation/expression" or "connection"
[19:24:26] <imode> one implies the other.
[19:24:36] <dimadima> i've had this discussion a bunch of times w/ my wife in particular. i always used to argue for the former, she used to argue for the latter. i've come around to her side a bit lately
[19:24:53] <dimadima> how so?
[19:25:03] <imode> creating something implies sharing something, because we don't function or create in a vacuum.
[19:25:06] <dimadima> and you mean expression -> connection or the converse?
[19:25:13] <dimadima> i see
[19:25:34] <dimadima> how would you apply that to something like multiplayer gaming? what are you creating?
[19:25:44] <dimadima> a shared fun experience?
[19:25:47] <imode> yup!
[19:26:45] <imode> the "next evolution" is by making everyone a literal creator, meaning there are tangible physical/digital artifacts rather than temporal/situational ones.
[19:27:04] <imode> roblox is there. kinda.
[19:27:20] <imode> but it's way too specific of a platform to build general communities off of.
[19:27:30] <imode> myspace was in the same vein.
[19:27:46] <kline> dimadima | the question is whether it's possbile to build a community/platform without optimizing for engagement
[19:27:48] <kline> this is a solved question
[19:27:49] <kline> the answer is yes
[19:28:17] <kline> "optimise for engagement" in tech is like 15 years old, but online communities have existed since way before that
[19:29:04] <kline> so clearly its possible
[19:30:18] <imode> people complained about the lack of homogeneity on myspace, and with facebook they're reaping what they sow.

[19:39:33] <companion_cube> Geekingfrog: I wonder what a community centered around IRC but with more tooling would look like
[19:39:56] <Geekingfrog> discord ? /s
[19:40:03] <companion_cube> (like, IRC bots that do more than regurgitating factoids)
[19:40:05] <companion_cube> nah
[19:40:07] <companion_cube> I do mean IRC
[19:40:24] <Geekingfrog> Any good idea for such bots?
[19:40:26] <companion_cube> like news, with tags, but all via IRC (possibly with the delay you mention)
[19:40:35] <companion_cube> langoust.in ? 😂
[19:40:37] <ngoldbaum> hey i resent that they can also make funny randomly generated responses 420 69 devs
[19:40:38] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[19:41:02] <imode> imo any community that wants to focus on tooling needs self-hosted bots.
[19:41:19] <imode> meaning, libera has a bot server. it runs a sandboxed language that's got time and space constraints.
[19:41:26] <imode> anybody can submit code to it.
[19:42:04] <imode> you wanna curb spam and draw people, well, there's your draw.
[19:46:32] <imode> (...that may or may not be my motivation for this lang stuff.)
[19:49:23] <companion_cube> hu, what does the bot server allow to do?
[19:49:51] <imode> instead of hosting your own bots, it throws 'em up on infra owned by the network.
[19:50:13] <companion_cube> in docker images? wasm?
[19:50:22] <imode> thaaaat's the haaard paaaart~
[19:50:32] <companion_cube> I don't see anything on the website :(
[19:50:58] <imode> I wasn't saying they literally had one, I was just saying in my ideal world they would have one, sorry.
[19:51:00] <imode> should've clarified.
[19:51:06] <companion_cube> ohhh I see.
[19:51:15] <companion_cube> yeah I'd probably explore wasm :D
[19:51:22] <companion_cube> if I had to do that
[19:51:48] <Geekingfrog> let's go build a startup: bot a service for IRC networks companion_cube !
[19:52:03] <companion_cube> and become rich!
[19:52:04] <ngoldbaum> letting randoms run arbitrary code on your infra is a hard problem
[19:52:08] <companion_cube> using rustycoucou
[19:52:12] <ngoldbaum> well, doing it without getting instantly pwned
[19:52:20] <imode> even WASM isn't safe.
[19:52:51] <Geekingfrog> I can totally expect a flood of assholes trying to mine cryptoshit from any source of free compute
[19:53:05] <imode> trying and yet failing.
[19:53:15] <imode> time constraints gotta be tight.
[19:53:20] <imode> along with memory.
[19:56:33] <companion_cube> imode: because of cpu timing attacks?
[19:56:39] <companion_cube> Yeah indeed
[19:56:49] <companion_cube> For the mining
[19:57:35] <imode> companion_cube: mhm. that and IIRC it's not possible to limit a WASM program's space usage in common runtimes.
[19:58:02] <companion_cube> Really? You can't put a bound on the allocations?! That seems weird af
[19:58:17] <companion_cube> Alternatively, you might use lua
[19:58:23] <imode> that's even worse.
[19:58:27] <Geekingfrog> but but but, it's untyped !
[19:58:32] <companion_cube> I think it's pretty easy to limit instruction count with the debug interface
[19:58:41] <Geekingfrog> containers seems more mature for these usecase
[19:58:47] <Geekingfrog> I believe aws λ is built on that
[19:58:54] <imode> eeeeeh.
[19:59:46] <companion_cube> So are the wasm things at cloudflare though
[20:00:02] <imode> companion_cube: afaict there's no way to limit memory usage because WASM's memory model allocates stuff in fixed pages, and getting more memory is a thing you can do.
[20:00:12] <companion_cube> If wasm is sandboxed enough for a browser...
[20:00:26] <companion_cube> imode: you can still deny the request for more memory
[20:00:34] <companion_cube> Just like malloc
[20:00:50] <imode> I don't think runtimes support that.
[20:01:00] <companion_cube> I'm a bit shocked

[20:24:26] <Geekingfrog> I know roughly nothing about wasm, but is it a fundamental limitation or could there be a runtime/fix to enable this memory limit?
[20:25:32] <imode> Geekingfrog: you'd have to compile it with a specific runtime. WASM iirc includes explicit instructions to grow memory.
[20:26:59] <companion_cube> https://docs.wasmtime.dev/api/wasmtime/trait.MemoryCreator.html <-- right, so you can use that I think
[20:26:59] <buttsbot> MemoryCreator in wasmtime - Rust
[20:27:05] <companion_cube> to fail if you allocated too much
[20:27:28] <companion_cube> Geekingfrog: wasm itself assumes you can allocate as much as you want, just like malloc() and the likes
[20:27:40] <companion_cube> whether a call to grow() or whatever fails depends on the runtime, the OS, etc. afaic
[20:27:41] <companion_cube> t
[20:30:33] <imode> companion_cube: you'll need to hand back _something_ in that case...
[20:31:01] <imode> I think.

[20:39:19] <companion_cube> I think it's neat personally :p
[20:39:34] <imode> I also think it's neat, but why is malloc a part of the instruction set.
[20:40:09] <imode> "how to restrict resources" should be a part of the WASM spec.
[20:40:17] <imode> and have an implementation in every runtime.
[20:41:21] <companion_cube> well, restrict resources is done on the runtime side
[20:41:25] <companion_cube> not from within
[20:41:36] <companion_cube> what's the point otherwise, since you don't trust the code?
[20:41:53] <companion_cube> malloc is part of the instruction set because the programs need to allocate memory :D
[20:42:05] <companion_cube> (I mean it's not exactly malloc, but close enough)
[20:42:11] <imode> if wasm can define a "I want more memory" call it should mandate within its spec that there should be some form of configurable resource limits otherwise the runtime isn't compliant.
[20:42:26] <imode> now it makes me wonder how call depth is handled.
[20:42:35] <companion_cube> well you ask for n more pages
[20:42:39] <companion_cube> the runtime can refuse
[20:42:41] <companion_cube> that's how it works
[20:42:57] <imode> spec doesn't say that. :P
[20:43:13] <imode> https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1163
[20:43:13] <buttsbot> Maximum evaluation stack depth · Issue #1163 · WebAssembly/design · GitHub
[20:43:15] <imode> well this is relevant.
[20:43:36] <companion_cube> just like an OS
[20:43:44] <companion_cube> there's no universal stack size, or heap size
[20:43:53] <companion_cube> > The memory.grow instruction grows memory by a given delta and returns the previous size, or −1 if enough memory cannot be allocated. Both instructions operate in units of page size.
[20:43:53] <imode> you could get around the memory limit by abusing locals and call frames.
[20:45:21] <imode> so all of these wonderful nonspecific limits get propagated forward.
[20:47:49] <companion_cube> I think the runtime should have limits by default
[20:47:52] <imode> companion_cube: the reason why I have an issue with that is because say I want to use a runtime binding for my particular language, but it doesn't allow for a user-specified memory provider or a resource cap. because it's not in the spec, there's no drive or expectation for the library writer to expose that to the user.
[20:47:55] <companion_cube> but it's ok to let it be configurable?
[20:48:05] <companion_cube> imode: then use a better runtime
[20:48:22] <imode> yeah. great. and if that doesn't exist?
[20:48:27] <companion_cube> "say I want to use a bad OS"
[20:48:35] <companion_cube> well there's at least wasmtime clearly :)
[20:48:36] <imode> that's not equivalent at all.
[20:48:44] <imode> yeah but _I don't use Rust_.
[20:48:49] <companion_cube> it has a C API…
[20:48:56] <companion_cube> example: https://github.com/LaurentMazare/ocaml-wasmtime/
[20:48:56] <buttsbot> GitHub - LaurentMazare/ocaml-wasmtime: OCaml WebAssembly runtime powered by Wasmtime
[20:49:07] <imode> great, so wasmtime is the ur-runtime.
[20:49:23] <companion_cube> you can also use wasmer, wasm3, v8…
[20:49:40] <imode> all of which aren't guaranteed to have resource limits configurable. I went through this with V8 isolates et. al.
[20:49:52] <imode> hence why everybody does some home grown solution.
[20:50:10] <companion_cube> the wasmtime thing mentions a WIP spec for a C API?
[20:50:15] <companion_cube> maybe this would have limits in it, idk
[20:50:44] <imode> maybe I'll submit a PR for the spec.
[20:50:56] <imode> there are runtime aspects that it covers.
[20:53:08] * imode thonk.
[21:01:49] <imode> I should definitely swap to variable length binary numbers.
[21:03:14] <imode> 4k for a factorial function is wayyyyyy too heavy even with a 3 bit encoding.
[21:04:06] <companion_cube> why this passion for brainfuck anyway? :D
[21:04:19] <imode> it ain't brainfuck.
[21:04:36] <imode> also, because it's surprisingly easy to make performant with very little actual spec.
[21:31:02] <riv> that's exciting
[21:31:20] <riv> would that translate into a really low eigenratio of a self interpreter stack?
[21:31:29] <imode> that's what I'm finding out!
[21:31:57] <imode> FV3 (the lang I've showed) is tiny enough where a self-interpreter is pretty small.
[21:35:56] <imode> you need three memory regions: program code, depth counter (for branching/looping) and the deque.
[21:36:17] <riv> how do you do that?
[21:36:57] <imode> some simple encoding, you encode your symbols as runs of 1s terminated by a 0. you could use fancier prefix ones but it'll increase the interpreter size a bit.
[21:37:04] <imode> at the cost of some runtime space savings.
[21:37:45] <riv> and how do you do the 3 memory regions?
[21:38:33] <imode> you'll need symbols to represent 0, 1, <, >, [, ], and a separator symbol to segment the regions.
[21:38:42] <imode> then you can just use the deque as memory.
[21:38:50] <riv> alright!
[21:39:18] <imode> so it goes <program code> <separator> <depth register (unary)> <separator> <deque memory>
[21:39:52] <imode> and you can write a simple piece of code to seek to a separator going back or forward.
[21:39:57] <companion_cube> is there a spec somewhere?
[21:40:07] <imode> ehh you'll need to do <separator> <deque memory> <separator>
[21:40:43] <imode> companion_cube: https://hastebin.com/raw/wijuqeqote
[21:40:55] <ngoldbaum> deque always felt like it would be a good name for a french-canadian hockey player
[21:41:15] <ngoldbaum> maybe the word just makes me think of the quebec nordiques
[21:42:28] <imode> it definitely needs a new name lmao.
[21:43:07] <imode> ayy ben eater did a video about BGP.
[21:43:42] <riv> nice! will watch with dinner
[21:44:00] <imode> lol it's already on lobste.rs.
[21:47:11] <imode> companion_cube: note that there's no I/O (yet), but I'm considering having an I/O split. read a bit, write a bit, if you want byte-wise I/O then the expected behavior is to accumulate bits into a shift register and then write that out every 8 shifts.
[21:47:42] <imode> _but_, I'm trying to think about how external devices communicate with this code, not just character I/O.
[21:47:51] <companion_cube> imode: that's quite surprising
[21:48:02] <companion_cube> I mean i'd have a hard time programming with a deque :D
[21:48:18] <companion_cube> the depth register contains… the length of the deque?
[21:48:45] <imode> ah, I was just saying what you'd need for a a self interpreter within this lang.
[21:49:09] <imode> the depth register contains the "nesting level" of the loops you scan through to go back and forth between [ and ].
[21:49:43] <imode> and you can treat the deque as a stack if you want. that's what I do for a lot of operations, but using a deque means you can also treat it as a tape, or as some slow RAM.
[21:50:04] <companion_cube> right, by just moving throuhg it
[21:51:02] <imode> in a traditional implementation in a high level language, the 'depth' is either not needed or is just a local somewhere.
[21:57:16] <imode> what I'd like to enable is the flexibility for "devices" to be attached and to speak with the FV3 code using I/O, so that you have the flexibility of either A: just going with the all-in-FV3 method with no optimizations or external devices, B: using an optimizing compiler/interpreter to understand these different access patterns, or C: use external device calls for things like fast RAM.
[21:58:48] <imode> A is "all of your code should run on a minimum viable interpreter", B is "all of your code now runs on an optimizing interpreter/is compiled to some backend from IR", C is "all your code should run on an interpreter that allows I/O escape hatches to provide functionality that you can't/don't want to optimize for".
[22:03:48] <companion_cube> IO mapped deque!
[22:05:13] <ngoldbaum> the new rangers forward
[22:27:07] <imode> eater's new video is incredibly informative.
[22:28:20] <riv> it's so good, refreshing my basic cisco networking stuff
[22:28:28] <ngoldbaum> the caviar one?
[22:28:34] <imode> same.
[22:28:42] <imode> ngoldbaum: ben eater.
[22:29:07] <Brekkjern> Man, his videos are great
[22:29:13] <Brekkjern> I should watch that one :S
[22:29:29] <Brekkjern> That one, and the one about USB...
[22:29:38] <imode> he does a live demonstration of BGP routing between an ISP and facebook's global network.
[22:29:58] <imode> jumping between routers.
[22:30:04] <ngoldbaum> ah this guy
[22:30:06] <imode> perfect demo IMO.
[22:34:03] <riv> ah nice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaGXPObx2Gs&list=PLowKtXNTBypH19whXTVoG3oKSuOcw_XeW

[22:34:05] <riv> he has a whole series on it
[22:34:13] <Brekkjern> Yep
[22:34:36] <Brekkjern> He's got one on serial interfaces, USB, 10Base-T
[22:34:45] <Brekkjern> And how an entire fucking computer works :P
[22:56:59] <Brekkjern> It's a shame that BGP video got removed from the site
[22:58:33] <imode> wat.
[22:58:51] <imode> aww why.

[23:00:42] <imode> that's lame, eater's video uses facebook's outage as the hook rather than the content focus.
[23:00:50] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I just asked in the main channel about it
[23:00:56] <riv> i posted it to https://laarc.io/
[23:00:57] <buttsbot> laarc
[23:01:42] <imode> I see their place clone got nuked. shame, I drew a metroid on there a while back.
[23:02:53] <riv> aw
[23:03:13] <riv> i haven't thought about place in a while, that thing was fun
[23:04:26] <ngoldbaum> TIL laarc.io
[23:04:34] <ngoldbaum> i wonder why he fucked off from lobste.rs
[23:04:47] <imode> the quality on laarc is imo much poorer.
[23:08:42] <ngoldbaum> wait is laarc.io actually running arc lmao
[23:08:47] <ngoldbaum> nice
[23:09:40] <dimadima> isn't a deque kind of like the flatmap of data structures? can make many other things out of it?
[23:10:10] <riv> yeah hehe
[23:10:26] <riv> it uses continuous to do web app ..stuff
[23:10:30] <riv> continuations*
[23:10:46] <riv> cant believe people tried to make that a thing
[23:11:05] <ngoldbaum> HN’s getting proper comment pagination any day now
[23:11:06] <dimadima> what is llarc.io
[23:11:07] <imode> dimadima: you can make anything out of it. in fact there's a reason for that: a deque automaton is just a special case of a queue automaton. and a queue automaton is equivalent to a regular turing machine with some slowdown.
[23:11:11] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: lol
[23:11:29] <ngoldbaum> appears to be an HN clone that a dude named shawn runs
[23:12:09] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: HN isn't open source, so shawn just made it look like christmas HN for shits?
[23:12:25] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: the example project that comes with arc is an HN clone
[23:12:30] <dimadima> table layout and everything
[23:12:57] <dimadima> imode: will do automatons some time. gah!
[23:13:02] <companion_cube> how hard can it be to replicate HN? 🤔🤔
[23:13:06] <dimadima> how can you live your life and not fuck with automata :(
[23:13:20] <imode> dimadima: oh, did I show you my factorial stuff?
[23:13:31] <ngoldbaum> rust HN clone when
[23:13:32] <dimadima> companion_cube: as hard as fucking with table layouts in 2021 can be?
[23:13:33] <ngoldbaum> web scale
[23:13:36] <dimadima> lol
[23:13:43] <companion_cube> dimadima: are table layouts _that_ bad? :D

[23:14:34] <riv> https://www.reddit.com/r/HermanCainAward/comments/q6l8fi/where_hca_winners_are_coming_from_covid_deaths/ What the fuck
[23:14:35] <companion_cube> I mean a HN alternative with proper markdown, for example, would be cool
[23:14:36] <buttsbot> Where HCA winners are coming from - Covid Deaths per 1M by Red/Blue States : HermanCainAward
[23:14:45] <dimadima> imode: i didn't see that.
[23:14:55] <dimadima> i saw this https://hastebin.com/raw/elojenuqen
[23:14:59] <riv> is this just coincidence
[23:15:00] <imode> dimadima: I just transcribed it from brainfuck for shits and giggles to test my current IR.
[23:15:14] <imode> yup, that's the resulting output from running it. :D
[23:15:15] <companion_cube> riv: oh wooooow
[23:15:47] <imode> washington leading the pack for the first few seconds.
[23:15:51] <imode> love my state. fuck covid.
[23:16:10] <ngoldbaum> riv: couching it like everyone who died of covid is a herman cain award winner is in really poor taste
[23:16:26] <ngoldbaum> far more poor taste than the whole concept of the herman cain award
[23:16:41] <imode> HCA is appropriate, but yeah, not everybody who died is worthy of one.
[23:16:54] <dimadima> yeah those first few nursing homes in WA
[23:17:04] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: I read this as: despite having a lot of advantages, red states have caught up because of HCA winners
[23:17:19] <dimadima> can't beleive they made some of the states purple as if there's any nuance to our political divies
[23:17:21] <dimadima> divides*
[23:17:23] <imode> go mississippi!
[23:17:23] <companion_cube> NY was fucked because of density; southern states are fucked because people are idiots
[23:17:40] <dimadima> companion_cube: NY was fucked by idiots too
[23:17:51] <dimadima> just a different flavor
[23:18:04] <dimadima> density didn't help of course
[23:18:13] <dimadima> imode: what do you mean by transcribed it from brainfuck
[23:18:14] <ngoldbaum> would be nice if they didn’t leave that ambiguous otherwise they’re looping in MTA bus drivers in april 2020 or whoever
[23:18:24] <companion_cube> dimadima: in what sense?
[23:18:43] <companion_cube> density has got to be a huge drawback at first, when people scramble to even know wtf is going on
[23:18:45] <imode> dimadima: as in, the _loop_bf "macro" corresponds to brainfuck's [ and ] instructions.
[23:18:58] <imode> and _inc and _dec correspond to brainfuck's + and - instructions.
[23:19:19] <imode> and _left(n) and _right(n) correspond to brainfuck's < and > instructions (just extended to byte boundaries.)
[23:21:02] <dimadima> companion_cube: delbasio denied the reality of covid for weeks. i freaked out when milan shut down min-febraury, quarantiend w/ my wife for a week and fled to my parents in baltimore. meanwhile deblasio was, like, "go have brunch, it's okay!" sorry not finding the tweets now.
[23:21:20] <dimadima> the difference between delbasio and london breed, for example, was huge
[23:21:30] <dimadima> https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/de-Blasio-London-Breed-tweets-coronavirus-March-2-15189898.php
[23:21:31] <buttsbot> Tweets show SF and NYC mayors' drastically different approaches to outbreak
[23:22:04] <companion_cube> is London Breed the mayor of SF? what a weird name
[23:22:12] <dimadima> and that's just in the city. at the state level you had the cuomo administration sending infected nursing home patients back to nursing homes
[23:22:36] <dimadima> then blabbering on in 3 hours press conferences that were qualitatively, in my opinion, not much different from trump/pence
[23:22:47] <dimadima> companion_cube: yeah, cool name, huh
[23:22:55] <companion_cube> well, that's a difference between idiots in power, and idiots in the street
[23:23:12] <dimadima> the day before they shut down bars in NY, deblasio was like "go out and have a good time before we close!"
[23:23:22] <dimadima> that tweet is out there, im just not finding it :(
[23:23:50] <dimadima> sorry about flooding on this subject, it was a shitty time in my life
[23:24:38] <companion_cube> didn't realize you lived there
[23:24:42] <imode> it was a shitty time in everyone's lives. I remember flying back and hearing that Amazon has suspended all non-essential travel.
[23:24:43] <prussian> companion_cube: sounds like a race horse name...
[23:24:46] <ngoldbaum> yeah, that was a bad month for having faith in leaders to do the hard thing in the face of compelling but incomplete evidence and tons of wild speculation and bullshit
[23:24:49] <dimadima> imode: so if i take ugipafojih.py i can run https://hastebin.com/raw/elojenuqen with it
[23:24:54] <prussian> Please tell me it really isn't London Breed
[23:25:02] <imode> dimadima: you can just take the .py file and run it.
[23:25:12] <imode> try it, it'll just run the test cases down in `main`.
[23:25:13] <companion_cube> a lot of people fucked up at first, the problem now is people who keep being stupid almost 2 years later
[23:25:25] <ngoldbaum> i really do wonder how different things would have been if the president wasn’t a fascist man-baby with dementia though
[23:25:27] <dimadima> companion_cube: i lived there until the first week of march, 20020
[23:25:37] <imode> ngoldbaum: honestly probably not much different.
[23:25:39] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: oh it'd have been better for sure
[23:25:43] <prussian> what imode said
[23:25:53] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: unclear; only SK and NZ ever got it under control
[23:25:54] <prussian> Only so much that can be done honestly.
[23:26:05] <imode> dimadima: and NZ basically just gave up recently.
[23:26:09] <companion_cube> I think there'd be an actual push for masks even in 2020
[23:26:20] <imode> companion_cube: that's at the state level, though.
[23:26:22] <dimadima> imode: i might do that.
[23:26:29] <companion_cube> imode: why couldn't it be at the federal level?
[23:26:37] <ngoldbaum> yeah they would have at least sent some masks to everyone in the country or something
[23:26:42] <dimadima> i just dont get how you send nursing home patietns with covid back to nursing homes
[23:26:47] <imode> because federal mask mandates iirc can't actually be enforced at the federal level.
[23:26:50] <imode> outside of federal property.
[23:26:54] <companion_cube> ugh, ok
[23:27:01] <dimadima> what elvel of detachment from reality does that require
[23:27:03] <imode> which is the shittiest thing but.

[23:28:34] <prussian> how blase of him.
[23:28:42] <prussian> not that last comment ofc
[23:28:43] <dimadima> prussian: hahaha
[23:28:46] <Xe> his sanity is almost completely gone

[23:29:25] <prussian> Xe: it's some real dark shit
[23:29:27] <companion_cube> that was, er, fun :D
[23:29:27] <dimadima> companion_cube: wow
[23:29:32] <Xe> dimadima: not in his state
[23:29:33] <companion_cube> (also it was a cross country move)
[23:29:34] <imode> Xe: I've been doing that. my sanity is uh. interesting.
[23:29:36] <dimadima> how long did that go on for
[23:29:45] <dimadima> Xe: i'm sorry to hear that
[23:29:48] <companion_cube> still going! we're engaged now, hence the "then girlfriend" :D
[23:29:52] <prussian> A friend of mine shot himself in the heart with a .22lr after I left to see my dad.

[23:29:58] <companion_cube> but yeah, from 0 to 24/7 together
[23:30:03] <prussian> idk how he lived.
[23:30:08] <dimadima> oh lol i didnt' intrepret "then" like that. excellent
[23:30:25] <dimadima> prussian: woah.
[23:30:31] <Xe> imode: what color is 5?
[23:30:52] <prussian> Brekkjern: funny about all that DNS stuff. My mom's work moved over to some new DNS bs, and they left zone transfers on.
[23:31:06] <prussian> dimadima: everyone has problems I guess.
[23:31:09] <imode> Xe: bleen
[23:31:22] <prussian> now he has fragments of lead in his lungs and more problems.
[23:31:26] <ngoldbaum> Xe: can they not finally get a vaccine by now?
[23:31:30] <prussian> anyhow
[23:31:35] <prussian> idk man.
[23:31:46] <imode> ngoldbaum: I'm vaccinated and I don't trust other people.
[23:31:57] <dimadima> imode: so how did you write https://hastebin.com/raw/elojenuqen
[23:32:20] <ngoldbaum> sure but also i don’t think lockdown to the point of no human contact is warranted either
[23:32:24] <imode> dimadima: the python file shows you how I did it.
[23:32:27] <ngoldbaum> masks and whatnot
[23:32:29] <dimadima> imode: the interpreter, while i only skimmed it, looks pretty straight forward. you know, read command and do them; but how did you produce that code
[23:32:29] <Xe> imode: what is the square root of potato?
[23:32:35] <dimadima> hmm looking
[23:32:40] <imode> Xe: knight to e6.
[23:32:48] <Brekkjern> Xe: Usually we call those "fries"
[23:32:52] <Xe> imode: yeah you're not as lost as you think
[23:32:56] <imode> dimadima: specifically line 284.
[23:32:58] <ngoldbaum> damn Brekkjern beat me to it
[23:32:59] <imode> onward.
[23:33:08] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: High five!
[23:33:09] <imode> Xe: lmfaoooo.
[23:33:20] <prussian> what is the right answer though?
[23:33:27] <ngoldbaum> although imo (potato)^2 = fries
[23:33:43] <Brekkjern> Well, it is a square shaped root...
[23:33:43] <ngoldbaum> dunno what the square root of potato is
[23:33:48] <prussian> asking about the sqrt(Potato) sounds like like some kind of catch 22 tier test
[23:34:04] <imode> well.
[23:34:07] <imode> potatos are root vegetables.
[23:34:10] <prussian> ngoldbaum: maybe cubed, idk about squared. squared might be like potato knishes?
[23:34:12] <prussian> or
[23:34:14] <prussian> hashbrowns?
[23:34:18] <prussian> hmm
[23:34:22] <prussian> now I am confused.
[23:34:25] <imode> so the square root of a potato is a potato chip.
[23:34:35] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: the cube root https://youtu.be/YGlRak6RbGA
[23:34:35] <buttsbot> Foodwishes' 500th Video! Potato Ball in Potato Box - Chef John's 500th YouTube Video Upload - YouTube - https://youtu.be/YGlRak6RbGA
