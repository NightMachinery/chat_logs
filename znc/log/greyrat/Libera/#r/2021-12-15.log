[00:52:27] <Bayes> Colombo yeah pretty much lots of unmaintained packages
[00:52:38] <Bayes> I feel like I want to use R minimally for the stats stuff only
[00:52:50] <Bayes> and then use a more general tool, possibly gnu make or something else, for pipelining
[00:53:43] <Bayes> there's a huge advantage of using an R-centric tool like drake/targets to be honest, but idk R is not the right environment for this
[00:54:16] <Bayes> also I linked to a paper about CRPS some time ago... the more I use it, the more I'm liking it
[00:54:35] <Bayes> worth giving some thought for those interested in model validation
[01:01:31] <Bayes> I personally like make, but I cannot
[01:01:51] <Bayes> I could never find a good way to integrate it with my scripts
[01:02:01] <Bayes> it's like the way I program my scripts is not very... make-able
[01:12:48] *** Joins: andreas303 (andreas303@ip227.orange.bnc4free.com)
[01:16:54] <Bayes> a random question for you all...
[01:16:56] <Bayes> how do you feel when you finish a paper?

[01:43:32] <Colombo> Bayes: same, I used GNU make for analyses, but... I had to bend over backwards for that. Having various parametrization and derived parameters is not nice with GNU make.
[01:43:47] <Colombo> I had the same bad experience with snakemake
[01:43:53] <Bayes> Colombo hmm
[01:43:54] <Colombo> so I basically gave up on the make systems.
[01:44:18] <Colombo> The moment something doesn't fit into the structure, the moment you want to change something, add another analysis... you need to do a lot of refactoring.
[01:44:36] <mefistofeles> we need research devops :P
[01:44:45] <mefistofeles> YAML based or something like that
[01:44:46] <Bayes> so in my case I have a say of scripts to be run sequentially, sometimes more than once with different arguments to create different files... that's where the make dependency trees starts getting ........ weird
[01:44:49] <Colombo> So I basically went to "if all(file.exists(skip))" pattern instead.
[01:44:59] <Bayes> xD
[01:45:24] <Bayes> so you handle things by hand flagging skippable steps with a file on disk?
[01:45:35] <Colombo> yes
[01:45:53] <Colombo> seems easier than to define the DAG
[01:45:53] <Bayes> hm
[01:46:07] <Bayes> why not just memoization then?
[01:46:22] <Colombo> its the same thing
[01:47:21] <Colombo> but you want to avoid reading big files
[01:48:23] <mefistofeles> can't remember the name of this python lib for accesing files and such
[01:48:25] <mefistofeles> damn
[02:02:48] <Bayes> mefistofeles what does it do?
[02:03:40] <mefistofeles> Bayes: I know it was inspired by molecular simulations results, so it allows an easy way to navigate like this type of data, many output files, logs and such
[02:03:44] <mefistofeles> in a very pythonic way
[02:04:27] <Bayes> oh that's nice\
[02:04:34] <Bayes> well that's something I've been thinking of a while
[02:04:48] <Bayes> so statistics is a discipline were simulations study are everywhere
[02:05:17] <Bayes> so it'd be nice to have something to structure a typical simulation study
[02:05:33] <Colombo> is there a typical simulation study?
[02:05:46] <Bayes> generate data, fit model, compute validation statistics, produce a report
[02:06:15] <Bayes> there's certainly a typical simulation study workflow
[02:06:28] <Bayes> I mean that's what drake started as

[02:15:07] <mefistofeles> oh I work with the author I just realize xD
[02:15:14] <mefistofeles> lol
[02:18:11] <Bayes> wat
[02:19:37] <mefistofeles> Bayes: well, not directly, but he's part of the collaboration and I meet with him from time to time
[02:19:54] <Bayes> say hi to him from us o/
[02:20:02] <mefistofeles> I will :)
[02:20:23] <Bayes> also I heard that working with HDF5 is a PITA
[02:20:33] <Bayes> but fortunately never had the pleasure
[02:20:53] <mefistofeles> hmm yeah, it's not great, but sometimes there aren't better alternatives
[02:21:04] <Bayes> hmm
[02:21:18] <Bayes> fortunately I've been able to work with text data
[02:21:20] <mefistofeles> I've been considering using something like protobuf for this data, lately... but nothing serious so far
[02:21:30] <Bayes> either tabular data, or other text-based formats
[02:21:44] <Bayes> they'll eat your space up pretty quickly lol but whatev
[02:21:57] <mefistofeles> yeah, if you translate a molecular simulation trajectory to plain text, that could be several hundreds of GBs of data for a single file
[02:22:00] <mefistofeles> :P
