[03:30:12] <Bakunin> Cyril of Alexandria (fragment 219) claimed that "camel" was a Greek scribal typo where kamêlos (κάμηλος, camel) was written in place of kamilos (κάμιλος, meaning "rope" or "cable").[3][5][6] More recently, George Lamsa, in his 1933 translation of the Bible into English from the Syriac, claimed the same.

[12:37:11] <mrig> Salt is great for calming the mind, is given as a remedy for mental stress in ayurveda and its accompanying cosmology.
[12:38:40] <amigojapan> I have high blood pressure :(
[12:39:46] <amigojapan> I love salt
[12:39:48] <mrig> yes it is said to reduce that, curiously there is no real scientific evidence that salt causes this. I think that high salt intake is a form of self medication not a cause.
[12:40:19] <amigojapan> I hope so
[12:40:19] <mrig> materialists often mistake symptoms for causes, and do damage in the process.
[12:40:36] <mrig> because they see so little of reality.
[12:40:47] <p0indexter> i am sure there is a limit as to how much sodium a human can take
[12:41:10] <p0indexter> there is an upper limit
[12:41:17] <mrig> yes of course, and usually your body and mind will tell you long before you are at that.
[12:41:42] <mrig> not everyone are very in touch with their senses though.
[12:42:04] <amigojapan> I remember gulping a mouthful of salt water sometimes at the beach in Mexico

[12:44:59] <mrig> Drinking salt water is really not very nice; Salt is rather good in food though.
[12:45:48] <mrig> I was not familiar with Himalayan salt, would like to try some now :)

[12:47:18] <p0indexter> amigojapan: soduim increases blood volume by causing fluid retention this puts increased demand on heart lungs and kidneys. there is an upper limit and failure.
[12:47:32] <amigojapan> Bitter herbs in salt represents the tears and bitter times of slavery in Egypt
[12:47:45] <p0indexter> most sodium is in proccessed western food

[13:03:24] <mrig> oh that is completely wrong, seems that it really is just soybeans.
[13:04:11] <amigojapan> "The overall flavor of soy sauce is a result of the balance and interaction among different taste components. The saltiness is largely attributed to the presence of NaCl (common salt) in brine. The sugars hydrolyzed from starch add sweetness into soy sauce."
