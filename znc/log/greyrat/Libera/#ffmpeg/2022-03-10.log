[01:58:00] <furq> you can double the video framerate without reencoding
[01:58:00] <AMM> or atempo
[01:58:08] <furq> atempo will keep the pitch the same
[01:58:36] <AMM> scratch that then
[01:58:44] <AMM> Also, you can?

[05:16:11] <znf> patricia, there's no "good" preset, there's presets that are fitting for your scope and what your scenario tolerates
[05:16:38] <znf> ultrafast will sacrifice quality/bitrate to be "fast"
[05:16:58] <znf> ie: at 600kb/s, ultrafast will produce crappy results, most likely

[07:00:53] <Ionic> Can I somehow restart a failed recoding process? I know at which frame the recoding failed (and at what time), so my general idea was to... copy from the truncated file first (using codecs copy for all streams; potentially dropping any frames beyond the very last keyframe or even a full minute just to be sure), then take data from the orignal file by skipping to the correct frame with the correct recoding
[07:00:59] <Ionic> parameters?
[07:07:03] <znf> you'd have to do it at the specific keyframe instead, but yes

I'm just not sure how to... oh... hm, probably via -to for the first file and -ss to the second input file. Not sure if I have to do some weird mapping, but... that could work. I just don't want to duplicate all streams.

Almost thought about switching to AV1 (since re-adding grain via a filter sounds like a great idea to lower the bitrate considerably), until I realized that none of my machines can decode it in HW, so meh, sticking to HEVC.

[15:48:18] <Doc46> Hey all, I'm trying to build Apache Guacamole on CentOS, which requires ffmpeg-devel. As there is no package available for CentOS 9-stream, I've built ffmpeg from source (Following the CentOS instructions on trac), however guac doesn't detect the libraries (libavcodec, libavformat, libavutil). Are there any additional steps I need to take to
[15:48:18] <Doc46> install the libraries - E.g. copy from ~/ffmpeg_build/libs to another folder?
[15:48:57] <JEEB> utilize a --prefix and then utilize PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/your/prefix/lib/pkgconfig when calling the configure for that other project
[15:49:13] <JEEB> configure --prefix, then you make and make install as usual
[15:49:22] <JEEB> and you should end up with stuff under your custom prefix
[15:50:08] <Doc46> Aah okay, I haven't had to do prefixes before, will investigate. Thank you :)
[15:50:34] <JEEB> I have usually a thing called ownapps in my home dir, and then various prefixes under that
[15:50:54] <JEEB> of course if this guac does not utilize pkg-config to get the flags required for FFmpeg, then that'll be quite sad :P
[15:50:57] <JEEB> but I hope it does
[15:51:12] <Doc46> I'd think it does, it's made by Apache
[15:51:52] <duuude> use debian
[15:52:36] <JEEB> you can even test it before hand by doing something a la `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/your/prefix/lib/pkgconfig pkg-config --libs libavcodec`
[15:52:57] <JEEB> which should then output the required flags for getting libavcodec from FFmpeg linked, which is one of the libraries
[15:54:21] <Doc46> `-L/home/guac/ffmpeg_build/lib -lavcodec -lvpx -lm -lz -lfdk-aac -lmp3lame -lopus -lx264 -lpthread -lx265 -lstdc++ -lgcc_s -lgcc -lrt -ldl -lswresample -lavutil -pthread -lm`

[16:03:53] <rhqq> i have -hls_list_size 2 -hls_delete_threshold 2 -hls_flags delete_segments params, to be exact
[16:04:27] *** Joins: l4yer (~l4yer@user/l4yer)
[16:05:25] <BtbN> It really should be deleting segments if you tell it to
[16:05:30] <rhqq> it doesn't
[16:05:33] <rhqq> that's the problem
[16:05:45] <BtbN> It doesn't immediately delete them when they fall out of the list, since something might have just fetched the list, and still wants those
[16:05:55] <BtbN> so it'll have 2x duration of list delay with deletes
[16:06:05] <rhqq> nope, it just produces them until disk is full
[16:06:12] <rhqq> nothing is using them, for sure
[16:06:25] <BtbN> Well, it didn't for me last time I used HLS
[16:06:28] <rhqq> earlier i just had hls_wrap 4 and that's it
[16:06:48] <rhqq> my current approach is to use old ffmpeg, because clearly something is wrong
[16:07:05] <rhqq> but i know it is not viable, so i'm seeking for help
[16:07:55] <BtbN> -hls_flags delete_segments -hls_delete_threshold 0 if you really want it to delete stuff the moment it falls out of the list
[16:08:12] <rhqq> ok, let me try

[16:10:42] <BtbN> there's your issue
[16:10:59] <BtbN> An event type playlist can only ever grow
[16:11:05] <rhqq> ah ok
[16:11:29] <rhqq> i copy-pasted that part from other hls streaming examples
[16:11:38] <BtbN> you want a live type playlist, i.e. omit any hls_playlist_type, if you want it to only have a small moving window
[16:12:04] <BtbN> event types are meant to stream stuff like a live concert, allowing viewers to seek back through the entire event, while appending the live content to the end
[16:12:33] <rhqq> okay, makes sense
[16:12:47] <rhqq> but i still will have a window as long as the list size, right?
[16:13:16] <BtbN> yeah
[16:13:24] <rhqq> ok, skiping hls_platylist_type made it exit after 2 segments
[16:13:50] <rhqq> well, 3
[16:14:07] <rhqq> ah, never mind, my bad
[16:14:15] <BtbN> By default it should keep two list sizes worth of segments on disk
[16:14:26] <BtbN> you can alter that via -hls_delete_threshold
[16:14:41] <rhqq> okay, it does work now
[16:14:41] <rhqq> yeah
[16:14:44] <rhqq> cool, thank you

[16:42:59] <bud> i have been hacking on this webextension (chrome/firefox)
[16:43:45] <bud> and i have managed to hook it up with this NativeMessaging thing, that lets you send messages from the browser extension to a external local application.
[16:44:11] <bud> my local application is a classic dirt hack url handler i have been using for years.
[16:44:47] <bud> and everything seems to work, except that whenever the URL handler executes a ffmpeg command, ffmpeg segfaults..
[16:45:41] <bud> i am suspecting that the issue is there is some kind of "resource cap" set by the browser. maybe, i cant find anything online about it.
[16:47:15] <bud> is there any options to ffmpeg i can use to "force" it run with less resource use? like --cpu-max 30% , i have no idea if this really is the issue.

[21:25:15] <durandal_1707> Coco77: you can set/control dithering with aresample filter
[21:26:00] <another|> Note that you will lose information.
[21:26:03] <Coco77> my question is do i need dither? what does it exactly? is it related how the downsampling is applied and how bits are deleted?

[21:27:26] <Coco77> i really don't understand all the info in the web that is why i aks here. I only whant do downsample from 24 to 16 bit, keep al metadatas and covers in the flac. and downsample in a way that gives the best result.
[21:29:47] <JEEB> if you do not know, the defaults are just fine
[21:29:55] <JEEB> they are sane
[21:30:51] <another|> you don't "delete bits". You resample with a different bitdepth
[21:31:13] <another|> hmm.. what _are_ the defaults anyway?
[21:31:18] <Coco77> that is why i ask here, to much misinformation in the web ;-)
[21:32:00] <JEEB> another|: swresample defaults I expect
[21:33:10] <Coco77> i read an acticle that says 24bit has only more dB Range and is useless for the endconsumer cause most music has maybe a range of 15 dB and classic maybe maximum 60 dB, but 16bit has 96dB and 24bit over 120 dB. That is why i think it is a good idea to convert my flac and save up to half od data, from 700GiB to maybe 350GiB
[21:34:40] <BtbN> >16bit is important if you are doing audio processing. For pure music consumption it's next to irrelevant

[21:35:03] <Coco77> all flac on bandcamp i purchased are 24bit or more
[21:35:12] <Coco77> my flac's has up to 1900kbps
[21:35:26] <Coco77> that is more than a 16bit wav with 1411kbps...
[21:36:04] <Coco77> but the second best option is 320kbps mp3, not really an option imo
[21:36:37] <Coco77> and redonwload my whole library is also a bigger pain then converting ^^
[21:36:51] <another|> JEEB: on a related note: what did libavresample do?
[21:37:43] <BtbN> 320kbps mp3 is usually more than fine
[21:37:45] *** Joins: fkaa (~fkaa@user/fkaa)
[21:38:11] <BtbN> If you already got music in 24bit, it's pointless to convert it to 16bit, unless you are really pressed for space
[21:38:41] <Coco77> in bandcamp you ever got wav, flac, mp3, and a lot more
[21:39:05] <Coco77> but i just noticed that all flac are marked as 32 bit, and it looks like they are 24bit in real
[21:39:58] <Coco77> just tried a few files now, and i save up to 50% of space.
[21:40:06] <Coco77> But.. the metadatas are messed up
[21:40:39] <Coco77> weird, from flac 24 to flac 16 some metadatas are changed..
[21:42:05] <Coco77> hmmm... looks like it is more complitaced than i thought D:
[21:45:31] <Coco77> Was probably a stupid idea to think about it, thanks for the help. Have a nice day
