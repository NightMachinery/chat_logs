After setting, I did (require 'ox) (require 'ox-publish) ... and that does not "just work", in that everything is exported without error, but also without CSS.

[03:37:02] <aidalgol> It's still dangerous misinformation, because it scares people away from using TOTP entirely, instead of just google apps, which *does* protect against a lot of attacks.

[06:10:22] <Spawns_Carpeting> its certainly not a priority
[06:10:45] <parsnip> the last issue on pkg-info was 2014
[06:10:55] <parsnip> so it's "stable", perhaps
[06:11:05] <parsnip> it's not really unmaintained, is it?
[06:11:12] <parsnip> it's "orphaned"
[06:11:23] <Spawns_Carpeting> yea perhaps orphaned might be a better word
[06:11:57] <parsnip> i don't know if "orphaned" is a perfect word, but it's definitely on "emacsorphanage" repo
[06:12:20] <parsnip> https://emacsmirror.net/stats/emacsorphanage.html
[06:12:28] <Spawns_Carpeting> it still seems silly to pull in two third party packages for something emacs was able to do by itself for (afaik) a very long time :3
[06:12:42] <parsnip> > Those unmaintained packages that made it into the orphanage instead of just the attic, did so because other mirrored packages depend on them, and/or because they are available from Melpa (I mirror all packages that are available from there).
[06:12:55] <parsnip> "unmaintained" is a fair descriptor i guess

[06:17:33] <Spawns_Carpeting> do you think it would be inappropriate to create a new issue for this? the main reason I am considering this is because the original issue included a patch that added a decent amount of code, and then after closing the issue this patch was suggested and I don't think anyone even noticed it
[06:17:37] <Spawns_Carpeting> i hate to be pushy though
[06:17:44] <Spawns_Carpeting> i dont want to come off as rude
[06:19:04] <parsnip> my intuition is, an issue is fair. because in the issue tracker, i suppose you're more likely to get a discussion on whether there really is an issue, and discuss ways to fix it, or what priority it has. but i've seen some project discourage such associated issues, beyond a PR.
[06:19:44] <parsnip> fdroid is one project where they don't seem to like explicit issues being opened to describe the context of some PRs
[06:20:29] <Spawns_Carpeting> i wouldn't care so much about this if it was only me effected, since I would just patch it myself locally and be done with it, but I maintain the gentoo flycheck package and would like to remove the deps from that as well!

[06:40:17] <parsnip> > In some mammals they are weapons of attack and defence. Examples are: wolves and dogs; the cat family; walrus. Baboons and the great apes have large canines, especially the adult males. In humans they are much reduced, and sit in line with the other teeth.
[06:40:27] <parsnip> cats have very small incisors
[06:40:46] <parsnip> you could research how different animals chew
[06:41:42] <parsnip> > Chewing is largely an adaptation for mammalian herbivory. Carnivores generally chew very little or swallow their food whole or in chunks.[10] This act of gulping food (or medicine pills) without chewing has inspired the English idiom "wolfing it down".

[06:43:04] <parsnip> > Most carnivorous mammals, from dogs to Deltatheridium, share several dental adaptations, such as carnassialiforme teeth, long canines and even similar tooth replacement patterns.[15] Most aberrant are thylacoleonids, with a diprodontan dentition completely unlike that of any other mammal; and eutriconodonts like gobioconodontids and Jugulator, with a three-cusp anatomy which nevertheless functioned similarly to carnassials.[12][16]

[09:45:49] <parsnip> which version of debian?

I can set the indentation to fix, but then it doesn't follow the indentation in scripts with different indentation length. So my workaround is to issue a python-indent-shift-left before defining the

[22:44:59] <bpalmer> rudybot: people who use external editors are far too likely to be authors, and we all know what that means about them in society.

[22:45:23] <artefact> use emacs as your terminal multiplexer, sidestep the problem entirely ;-)
[22:45:25] <johnjaye> lol. so the problem was i did /key bind meta-v window page_up as opposed to /window page_up
[22:45:31] <johnjaye> i guess it printed the literal text

[22:45:41] <johnjaye> artefact: i'm considering that as well
[22:45:53] <johnjaye> but tmux is very good in terminal. does emacs have tabbed output in terms?
[22:45:53] <artefact> vterm and multi-vterm are really cool
[22:45:57] <artefact> sure
[22:45:58] <rudybot> bpalmer: In a perfect society, authors could recieve a decent wage merely by being a valuable contributor to the community. That would lead to a more fair distribution of money too, now authors are either barely getting by or super rich, because their wages are approx. linear with respect to their popularity. You could give the dollars that Bieber would otherwise waste to lesser known artists, fostering a richer culture.
[22:45:59] <bpalmer> just use a bunch of computers side by side and forget multiplexing.

[23:04:03] <corwin> johnjaye: hrm, I'm not sure what the bot gave it is it, but I agree there is package for that.  I'll hunt..
[23:04:42] <johnjaye> Diablo-D3: if i use emacsclient a bit more i may be able to understand your requirement more. i agree it would be nice if emacs could totally replace tmux
[23:04:45] <corwin> I think this is what I was thinking of: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Desktop
[23:05:10] <Diablo-D3> johnjaye: emacsclient connects to the same emacs state, but each emacsclient is its own pane
[23:05:25] <Diablo-D3> er, its own frame
[23:05:30] <corwin> I think pane means 'frame'.. ok :D
[23:06:14] <Diablo-D3> I cant tell emacsclent to connect to an existing frame by name
[23:06:26] <Diablo-D3> yet I can tmux attach -t name

[23:09:35] <johnjaye> ok. it's a bit confusing because emacs has both frames windows and now tabs or something
[23:09:43] <johnjaye> but i guess the tmux equivalent to a window is an emacs frame

[23:10:00] <johnjaye> or wait maybe not
[23:10:44] <Diablo-D3> I dont use emacs tabs, but I think those might be equivalent to tmux windows
[23:11:11] <johnjaye> i'm building from git now so i guess i'll find out

[23:13:53] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, emacs vterm works well, but its just not what Im looking for

[23:14:04] <bpalmer> a tmux window is a screen; it is divided up into rectangular sections called panes.  So I think tmux window = emacs frame; tmux pane = emacs window.

[23:15:00] <bjc> the tmux screens are more like emacs tabs, imho, since you can't actually spawn a new frame-alike in tmux

[23:15:54] <bpalmer> Isn't C-a c spawning a new frame-alike?  (assuming C-a is bindkey)
[23:16:10] <bjc> it's more of a tab
[23:16:29] <bjc> it even puts a little tabby-type thing in the status bar that you can click on
[23:17:09] <bjc> frames can be viewed simultaneously, tabs within a frame can't

[23:18:38] <bpalmer> in a terminal (and ignoring tmux/screen multplexing), you can view only one emacs frame at a time.
[23:18:59] <bjc> emacs supports frames in terminal? how's that different from tabs?
[23:19:08] <bjc> (other than tabs being much newer than frames, obviously)
[23:19:12] *** Joins: yosik (~user@user/yosik)
[23:19:18] <rpav> how are tabs not windows
[23:19:24] <bjc> tabs contain windows
[23:19:27] <bjc> frames contain tabs
[23:19:30] <bpalmer> I don't know much about emacs tabs.

[23:19:43] <rpav> my guess is more that tabs are a hack that switch a window
[23:19:47] <bpalmer> But yes, it does; try emacs -nw and then C-x 5 2. You can switch among frames with C-x 5 o
[23:19:57] <bjc> tabs switch entire window configurations, not just one window
[23:20:15] <bpalmer> (you'll probably need to change some windows configuraitons ont he frames to distinguish them from one another)
[23:20:28] <johnjaye> well for now i'm going to just leave pageup/pagedown bound to previous-window and next-window in tmux
[23:20:41] <johnjaye> and i told weechat to use emacs style ctrl-v and meta-v for the same

[23:32:53] <rpav> seems a bit unfortunate.. no nested tabs
