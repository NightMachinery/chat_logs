[16:39:41] <Brekkjern> lol
[16:42:10] <Brekkjern> That dotplan article has a great intro:
[16:42:10] <Brekkjern> >Dotplan is an API specification through which the technically capable can express their personalities (or lack thereof) with one another.
[16:51:42] <prussian> w-wut
[16:53:02] <Brekkjern> Post on the site
[16:53:18] <prussian> ya, but... what is a plan
[16:53:38] <prussian> I see..
[16:54:03] <Brekkjern> A way to express that you are a bit too focused on Unix
[16:54:34] <prussian> I knew that `finger`ing was a thing, but never actually got around to learning what its purpose really was for.
[16:55:54] <Brekkjern> I'm really having trouble not answering that in jest..
[16:57:23] <prussian> semi sort of the joke. someone at my work apparently had a lot of experience using it in some university in the olden days.
[16:57:48] <prussian> also note the backticks to make it not innuendo :)
[16:58:24] <Brekkjern> There is no way to not make it into innuendo :P
[16:59:57] <prussian> speaking of plans. I need to improve my planning ability
[17:00:09] <prussian> I haven't even logged into work jira in like a week. lol
[17:00:31] <Geekingfrog> lucky you
[17:00:48] <prussian> I guess.

[17:44:59] <Brekkjern> Pet peeve: When an error message in a highly technical system tells me to "please do X" rather than just giving me the command, or a reference to some documentation
[17:45:20] <Brekkjern> Or just telling me what is missing...
[17:45:44] <Geekingfrog> You may not be cleared for such confidential information.

[18:02:34] <Brekkjern> Anyone else keep getting results from gitmemory rather than the actual github repos?
[18:02:51] <Brekkjern> When doing google searches that is
[18:06:13] <companion_cube> I got one yesterday and didn't know wtf it was
[18:06:21] <companion_cube> Someone had SEO'd hard
[18:08:40] <gerikson> honest question: is the image here (that follows you as you scroll down!) more or less "sexualized" than the furry images on @soatak's blog? https://rubenerd.com/im-not-sure-that-unix-won/
[18:08:41] <buttsbot> Rubenerd: I’m not sure that UNIX won

[22:52:18] <gerikson> but that is because I have a pirated rip of a 4CD Revolutionary Girl Utena soundrack

[22:59:50] <Brekkjern> Woe upon the other students who don't already have 10 years of coding behind them :S
[23:01:35] <riv> I just learned that O(log(n!)) = O(n log(n)) thought that was cool

[23:39:46] <Brekkjern> Do a substitution? Something like s/href=\//href=https:\/\/original.domain\//
[23:40:07] <Brekkjern> Probably have to do it with src= as well
[23:40:39] <Brekkjern> But why keep the links pointing to the original host?
[23:40:55] <riv> you should download with something that converts
