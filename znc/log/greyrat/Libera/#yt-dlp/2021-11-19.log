[01:50:18] <cow_2001> wish ytdlp didn't go discord
[01:50:22] <cow_2001> alas
[01:55:24] <opal> oh it did?
[01:55:34] <opal> seems like they'll never have an official presence here then
[01:58:38] <cow_2001> alas
[01:58:42] <cow_2001> sigh

[13:26:47] <ede> well someone should tell them irc is where the users are
[13:27:26] <ede> people who prefer shiny GUIs like Discord's would probably use a downloader with a shiny GUI instead
[13:28:07] <ede> and those not using yt's atrocious web ui would avoid discord's for the same reason
[15:39:08] <ede> i have a list of the `-ij --flat-playlist` style, that's a json struct per row for each video. could i use it to download them or would i have to loop manually over it?
[16:05:14] <gnoo> ede: jq -r '.webpage_url' file.json | yt-dlp -a -
[16:16:43] <ede> ah cool, thanks. didn't think of jq. also nice that it doesn't need a file with a single main object (read: -iJ)

[18:09:13] <bleb> I can't remember why I switched from youtube-dl
[18:26:37] <ede> youtube throttling perhaps

[23:14:14] <opal> i think age-restricted videos not getting patched in ytdl
[23:14:46] <opal> im gonna be honest irc sucks and i think they'd have more success on matrix than either discord or irc
[23:14:54] <opal> and matrix still allows bridging to both of those
[23:17:13] <bleb> irc > matrix > discord
[23:17:50] <opal> its ok to be wrong
[23:17:59] <bleb> yeah
[23:18:17] <opal> im actually an xmpp proponent but i understand matrix's strengths
[23:18:24] <opal> despite its stupid weaknesses

[23:36:10] <ede> my matrix experience was horrible. while i'm using more or less the same program for irc for 2 decades soon and it's ok.
[23:37:26] <ede> also, i don't see how they'd be able to patch age-restriction. last time yt implemented it in the web gui only, if it's burried deep enough now the game may be over.
