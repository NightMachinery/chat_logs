[15:53:30] <fendor[m]> is the hls installation script now officially deprecated?
[15:55:17] <fendor[m]> at least, my hls built from source via installation script crashes
[16:00:31] <fendor[m]> seems to be related to a nix shell that spams the output
[16:06:14] <drsooch[m]> 1.6 announced its deprecation per https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2654#issuecomment-1027832102
[16:14:05] <fendor[m]> true, what I actualy meant, is it really broken now and in that sense "inofficially" out now

[16:17:42] <maerwald> it's official when you delete it
[16:40:55] <fendor[m]> yes yes üòõ My last big contribution left from HIE days ‚òπÔ∏è We should probably get rid of it now. 
[16:41:33] <fendor[m]> Does ghcup utilise some kind of cache when building hls from source? It finished for some commit in only a couple of seconds  
[16:41:46] <maerwald> fendor[m]: your global cache
[16:42:40] <maerwald> and since it uses `cabal install`, it won't rebuild unless there are source changes
[16:43:23] <fendor[m]> ah, ok, makes sense, I did build it before via the script but in my mind it should have invalidated some cache
[16:45:35] <fendor[m]> but I guess, that's the magic of cabal install
[16:59:48] <maerwald> the source files are part of the cabal hash

[21:41:29] <maerwald> fendor[m]: can https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/pull/533 be merged?
[21:43:56] <fendor[m]> maerwald: I would like to review it in depth one more time... Are you fine with a squash merge? Otherwise I would probably rename your "WTF" commit üôÇ
[21:44:06] <fendor[m]> s/rename/reword/
[21:46:12] <maerwald> I'm not sure why squash merges are popular
[21:46:49] <fendor[m]> Only if the individual commits aren't that interesting

[21:47:45] <maerwald> I don't have a strong opinion about git anymore
[21:47:50] <fendor[m]> E.g. when you have "Attempt 1", "Attempt 2", "Attempt 3" as commit s, but only all of them together are really useful
[21:48:03] <maerwald> I personally just force a merge commit in such a case
[21:48:10] <maerwald> that makes it clear they're related
[21:50:48] <fendor[m]> in a merge commit? But they are three commits in the history, after merge, I don't think it is trivial to tell that. Also it makes it more annoying to go back in the history when either the project doesn't build or the tests fail
[21:54:11] <maerwald> just merge
[21:55:14] <fendor[m]> ok üòÄ

[22:23:31] <fendor[m]> maerwald, how does the ghcup prefetch feature work? I tried prefetching locally, but installing afterwards still downloads a tar file
[22:23:55] <maerwald> fendor[m]: you need to enable caching
[22:24:00] <maerwald> ghcup --cache install ...
[22:24:20] <maerwald> or: ghcup config set cache true
[22:25:25] <fendor[m]> ah, I understand, thank you! 
[22:28:38] <fendor[m]> Ok, I think I am blind, is that enabled in the test-suite somehow? I can't find that exact invocations
[22:30:28] <maerwald> I guess not
[22:31:27] <fendor[m]> I think I messed up the environment variables at some point
[22:34:23] <fendor[m]> is it always safe to invoke install with `--cache`?
[22:35:27] <fendor[m]> Or should we just make sure we config ghcup with cache on for the tests only?
[22:36:48] <maerwald> cache is more error prone, of course... if you enable cache, ghcup finds the file in its cache, but the file is busted or has wrong hash, it will just fail
[22:38:53] <fendor[m]> OK, then I will enable it just in ci
[22:40:52] <maerwald> fendor[m]: I suggest to refactor the ghcup calls into this: https://paste.tomsmeding.com/MbVtbRIR
[22:41:57] <maerwald> esp to not forget the GHCUP_INSTALL_BASE_PREFIX env override
[22:42:16] <maerwald> and will be easier to add a HLS option to use the default prefix
[22:43:43] <maerwald> I can write a patch
[22:43:52] <maerwald> I already have the editor open
[22:46:36] <fendor[m]> OK, have fun, I am out doing some sports 
[22:47:01] <fendor[m]> You can leave all Ci errors to me
