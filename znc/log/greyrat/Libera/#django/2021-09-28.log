[00:13:06] <pycode> but why?
[00:13:12] <pycode> i already added static/
[00:13:20] <pycode> does it need absolute?

[01:04:47] <FunkyBob> pycode: so, STATIC_ROOT is irrelevant here
[01:05:12] <FunkyBob> pycode: is  the static file in questoin inside an app?
[01:05:19] <FunkyBob> or is it in a general project-wide static dir?
[01:05:26] <pycode> last one
[01:05:38] <pycode> it is the static folder on the same level of the project folder
[01:05:48] <pycode> the main static folder
[01:05:53] <pycode> not inside an app
[01:05:53] <FunkyBob> and is that folder listed in STATICFILES_DIRS?
[01:06:01] <pycode> now yes
[01:06:01] <FunkyBob> there is no "main static folder" in django
[01:06:06] <pycode> and it works
[01:06:11] <FunkyBob> is it still listed as STATIC_ROOT?
[01:06:27] <FunkyBob> STATIC_ROOT is only used as "where to collect static to"... otherwise, django ignores it
[01:06:29] <pycode> FunkyBob, when i run collectstatic i see that django creates static/
[01:06:35] <pycode> ah
[01:06:36] <pycode> ok
[01:06:37] <FunkyBob> why are you running collecstatic?
[01:06:43] <pycode> jsut for collectstatic
[01:06:44] <FunkyBob> you said you're using runserver
[01:06:50] <pycode>  no no i am not running it
[01:06:52] <pycode> i am saying
[01:06:55] <pycode> that i have theme
[01:07:07] <pycode> in templates/ and statics in static/
[01:07:07] <FunkyBob> yes, I read that
[01:07:25] <pycode> so i will like to keep them into those folders instead of creating new app
[01:07:44] <FunkyBob> so?
[01:07:48] <FunkyBob> doesn't answer my question
[01:07:56] <FunkyBob> collectstatic is not relevant when using runserver
[01:08:04] <pycode> i am not running collectstatic
[01:08:07] <FunkyBob> ...
[01:08:07] <pycode> STATICFILES_DIRS does the job
[01:08:11] <FunkyBob> 20:51 < pycode> FunkyBob, when i run collectstatic i see that django creates static/
[01:08:13] <pycode> now i can see static
[01:08:16] <pycode> yes
[01:08:20] <pycode> when i tested it yes
[01:08:22] <FunkyBob> 20:52 < pycode> i am not running collectstatic
[01:08:28] <FunkyBob> for testing
[01:08:29] <FunkyBob> ok
[01:08:33] <pycode> so i thought static/ folder was a default django folder
[01:08:37] <FunkyBob> no
[01:08:39] <pycode> ok
[01:09:01] <FunkyBob> static/ dirs inside apps, and STATICFILES_DIRS .. are where django looks for static files
[01:09:13] <FunkyBob> I did a lightning talk on this because people misunderstood it so much
[01:10:00] <pycode> FunkyBob, ok thanks for the explanation, so do you think having a "general" folder static/ and templates/ to install theme/skin etc is good? or...is better to keep them inside app ?
[01:10:21] <pycode> (do you mean you did a video about that?)
[01:10:30] <FunkyBob> having them in project-wide dirs makes sense...
[01:10:45] <pycode> ok
[01:10:51] <pycode> i will leave them there
[01:10:54] <FunkyBob> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEZYDDaDeCs&feature=youtu.be&t=1790
[01:11:32] <pycode> thanks
[01:12:23] <FunkyBob> upon review, I could have pointed out more of the details, like runserver doesn't care one whit for STATIC_ROOT
[01:14:20] <pycode> ok yes because when i deploy it i will serve static from nginx and it works, the problem is when i decided to move templateS/ and static/ in the project-wide dirs
[01:15:51] <pycode> but nevermind i have understood it now :)
[01:15:52] <pycode> thanks
[01:16:18] <FunkyBob> runserver will, when DEBUG=True, serve static for you... and it will find the files using the same machinery as collectstatic does
[01:17:18] <pycode> ok
[01:20:53] <FunkyBob> so, if you moved your static files from within an app, to a project-level dir, that would all make sense

[04:58:46] <sahilsinha> Hi there. I have a long running workflow and I'm wondering how I can run different versions of the python code when I change my workflow but keep the same one running for those who have already started it. My current thinking is to save the git revision to an object and just make sure I'm importing from the right revision when I execute. Any ideas? Not sure exactly how to do my plan either but looks like GitPython might be able to
[04:58:46] <sahilsinha> do what I want.
[05:00:08] <FunkyBob> you... might want to elaborate on how these "workflows" are implemented...

[05:02:43] <sahilsinha> FunkyBob: homegrown library works on a tick/event driven basis. the can go on forever, end, or repeat.
[05:03:21] <sahilsinha> we use the library to define our flows. it's something like the viewflow library I've seen in djangoland
[05:04:13] <FunkyBob> single process? persistent process?
[05:04:21] <FunkyBob> not inside the web requset/response flow?
[05:04:23] <sahilsinha> Alice could be runnign FooFlow from 3 months ago but we would want Bob who is starting FooFlow to run the latest
[05:04:33] <sahilsinha> outside but the requests trigger ticks

[05:05:01] <sahilsinha> then the tick sends a task to celery to actually execute the flow from the right spot
[05:05:26] <FunkyBob> so they're celery tasks
[05:05:46] <FunkyBob> version your job functions
[05:06:01] <sahilsinha> well they run through celery, the workflows themselves are outside of celery and quite large
[05:06:07] <FunkyBob> ...
[05:06:16] <FunkyBob> ok, this is getting nowhere.
[05:06:20] <FunkyBob> I'm going back to work.
[05:06:27] <sahilsinha> ha ya I'm sorry normally I can pose a better question

[07:59:39] <Steve-Dusty> Also I wana get an internship
[07:59:46] <Steve-Dusty> can you get an internship as a freshman
[07:59:55] <FunkyBob> could be work setting up and running a DjangoGirls event... good way to kick-start people
[07:59:58] <Steve-Dusty> My Django skillz here https://github.com/Steve-Dusty
[08:00:05] <FunkyBob> what is a 'freshman' in real terms/
[08:00:06] <FunkyBob> ?
[08:00:08] <Steve-Dusty> 9th grade
[08:00:10] <Steve-Dusty> in high school
[08:00:12] <Steve-Dusty> in US
[08:00:18] <FunkyBob> out of how many grades?
[08:00:23] <Steve-Dusty> 4 grades
[08:00:34] <FunkyBob> 9th of 4...
[08:00:34] <Steve-Dusty> in the US elementary school have 6 grades
[08:00:38] <Steve-Dusty> nooo
[08:00:41] <Steve-Dusty> I meant 9th in total
[08:00:47] <Steve-Dusty> so 1st grade high school
[08:00:50] <FunkyBob> and I mean.. total, in total
[08:00:56] <Steve-Dusty> out of 12 grade
[08:00:57] <Steve-Dusty> s
[08:01:08] <Steve-Dusty> so basically 15
[08:01:41] <FunkyBob> where I live we have Primary and Secondary school, with 7 and 6 years each... though the very first is called "Prep" or "Foundation", and your second year is Grade 1
[08:03:40] <Steve-Dusty> same thing here. Primary is elementaryy and secondary means high school
[08:03:53] <Steve-Dusty> but we have a MIDDLE
[08:03:57] <FunkyBob> but you said there were 4 years
[08:03:59] <Steve-Dusty> where is 6, 7, 8
[08:04:02] <Steve-Dusty> look
[08:04:02] <FunkyBob> so not the same
[08:04:06] <Steve-Dusty> Elementary school: 6 years
[08:04:16] <Steve-Dusty> Middle school: 3 years
[08:04:19] <Steve-Dusty> High school: 4 years
[08:04:30] <FunkyBob> some important lessons here :)
[08:04:37] <Steve-Dusty> when I say "6 years" it goes up to 5th grade (for most) including Kindergarten
[08:04:44] <FunkyBob> don't assume the world is all the same... and details matter, clear communication avoids mistakes.
[08:04:48] <Steve-Dusty> ikik
[08:04:52] <Steve-Dusty> ok
[08:05:03] <FunkyBob> Kindergarten here is something 3-4 y/o kids visit a couple of days a week
[08:05:13] <FunkyBob> however, one state north it's what they call prep... so...
[08:05:41] <Steve-Dusty> so okay, can I get a django internship at the first year of secondary school?
[08:05:48] <FunkyBob> no idea
[08:05:50] <Steve-Dusty> just so college
[08:05:54] <Steve-Dusty> I neeed internship to get into college
[08:06:02] <Steve-Dusty> cuz GOOD colleges will look at ur work exp
[08:06:19] <Steve-Dusty> and not just cleaning floors and serving people food or stuff. but instead like engineering and cool computer stuff
[08:06:29] <FunkyBob> work experience _before_ you've gone to college?
[08:06:33] <Steve-Dusty> i'm trying to aim for UCSD and UCLA
[08:06:53] <Steve-Dusty> Huh? I'm gonna join the military after college
[08:06:55] <FunkyBob> yet another barse-ackwards concept from your dumpter fire of a country :/
[08:07:03] <Steve-Dusty> :rage:
[08:07:35] <Steve-Dusty> yo
[08:07:41] <Steve-Dusty> dont you come to LA every once in an year?
[08:07:49] <Steve-Dusty> u don't like it :(  ?
[08:09:11] <FunkyBob> SF, not LA
[08:09:14] <FunkyBob> twice a year
[08:09:17] <FunkyBob> for work
[08:09:22] <FunkyBob> and not since the plague
[08:09:29] <Steve-Dusty> Django dev allows you to come to SF?
[08:09:33] <Steve-Dusty> it's just django tho
[08:09:45] <Steve-Dusty> you can code some django at home right
[08:10:28] <FunkyBob> no,I don't currently do django for work
[08:10:38] <Steve-Dusty> what do you do?
[08:10:47] <FunkyBob> work insistes on all remote engineers coming to the office for one week every 6 months
[08:11:11] <Steve-Dusty> https://imgur.com/a/JycXBjt meanwhile outside of django irc...
[08:11:12] <FunkyBob> currently, I suffer through front end work... was originally hired to work on our python based data analysis pipeline
[08:11:29] <Steve-Dusty> bRuh!? You're doing FRONTEND NOW?
[08:11:31] <Steve-Dusty> what do u do
[08:11:35] <Steve-Dusty> can I see some UIs u design?
[08:14:20] <Steve-Dusty> I don't understand what a Pipeline is

[10:25:52] <kydd> Hi! Using parallel testing, how can I throttle the rate at which certain tests are executed? I have a bunch of tests that hit an external endpoint that stops responding when it exceeds a rate limit. Is there a way to get around this?
[10:26:41] <kydd> I was thinking of using multiprocessing semaphore, and using it in the tests. unfortunately it did not seem to work (maybe the semaphore was imported wrong?)

[10:36:33] <shangxiao> FunkyBob: sounds like a fun job, travelling to SF
[10:39:18] <shangxiao> kydd: I guess this is why it's discouraged to hit endpoints in testing :P  My initial thought might be to insert a sleep if an argument is passed or something.
[10:43:37] <kydd> shangxia: I have tried this, but it works a bit inconsistent when I runn 4+ processes for the test, because sleeping does not necessarily prevent the endpoint being hit multiple times at the same time

[18:24:32] <GinFuyou> > from django.urls import include, path
[18:24:40] <GinFuyou> Yes, looks invalid
[18:24:49] <node1> Why?
[18:25:24] <Croves> Any idea why I can't access 127.0.0.1:8000? Trying to run django + gunicorn and postgres in Docker https://dpaste.org/P47x
[18:25:52] <node1> I have faced the same issue. I found by default this module was absent in [Main python packages].urls.py file
[18:26:10] <GinFuyou> node1, because it's caused by not following the tutorial or making mistaking doing it
[18:26:33] <GinFuyou> > The next step is to point the root URLconf at the polls.urls module. In mysite/urls.py, add an import for django.urls.include and insert an include() in the urlpatterns list, so you have:
[18:26:43] <pycode> hello, i have a field of this type: slug = models.SlugField(unique=True)   it must be unique because then i use it for urls, now, how can i prevent duplication with slug ?
[18:26:51] <pycode> should i create a custom save method?
[18:27:04] <node1> oh yes. :) thank you.
[18:27:12] <node1> every statement is very much important :)
[18:27:17] <piscvau> a may be stupid question. I am using django for a small website and would like to include some verys simple javascript for buttons, etc...I Have seen that you can have a media class in forms and I like the idea to see in the python code which javascript is used. For only display views, there is no form. So the only solution is to sort of hide the javascript files in the template. Did I miss something?
[18:27:32] <GinFuyou> Naturally, as in any programming language I believe?
[18:28:10] <GinFuyou> If tutorial was missing it somewhere - yeah, it would be a valid ticket, but I don't see such a case here
[18:29:18] <GinFuyou> pycode, not really clear, how do you generate slugs in first place? If you try to insert duplicated one, your form should prevent it before save()
[18:30:22] <pycode> GinFuyou, Yes thats the question
[18:30:45] <GinFuyou> piscvau, also not clear what you mean by "see in the python code which javascript is used"
[18:31:01] <pycode> GinFuyou, the question is about saving
[18:31:09] <pycode> how can i crate unique slugs?
[18:31:28] <GinFuyou> uuid.uuid4() ^_^" ?
[18:31:38] <GinFuyou> Well I guess you mean other case
[18:32:15] <piscvau> well I mean see it in the python code of the form rather than in the template. I guess I have some bias which is I read python much better than django template!.....
[18:32:47] <GinFuyou> If we say you take for slug a title of article up to 42 characters you could run validate_unique and if it fails add a positional number or random string, or whatever to it

[19:23:32] <pycode> so i thought to put it "centralized"
[19:23:33] <pycode> :)
[19:23:57] <GinFuyou> Yes, model method or maybe manager method which you like better
[19:24:33] <GinFuyou> You can override save(), sure, I do that a lot, but I think it's a bit dirty after all
[19:25:07] <pycode> GinFuyou, just to understand it better....do you think that overriding the save method is unuseful because i should manage the slug just one time
[19:25:07] <pycode> ?
[19:26:25] <GinFuyou> No I think overriding save() is a bit confusing work code maintainability and a bit risky since you have to keep in mind when logic there has to run and not cause a loop
