[00:17:57] <holycow> where do I find the contact information of the wicd wifi management package?
[00:18:00] <tjcarter> PerfDave: Oh I'm aware of the arguments. I'm not saying Debian should not have other crons, just that the best default for a systemd system is systemd-cron
[00:18:28] <holycow> it has been dropped for d11 and i would like to find out how much work he thinks it would be to patch it up
[00:18:37] <svendre> hi all - bought one of those new Asus Zenbook 13's.. went to do the install, and the keyboard doesn't work outside of grub. I figure it's a driver issue, but not really sure. If anyone knows what I ought to do to get it to work please let me know. So far, I've tried the free and nonfree live images with KDE plasma.
[00:19:39] <svendre> I'm apparently not the only person affected from a few searches, but I haven't found anything definitive so far except for references to plug in an external keyboard to do the install then make some xorg mods..
[00:20:24] <holycow> i have never seen that issue svendre ... i dont even know what to sugest

[00:21:06] <svendre> They have this function key + esc thing that "locks" the keyboard. The telltale sign is that the led light on the function key stays on at the times when the keyboard remains locked. I've tried graphic and non-graphic installs.
[00:21:45] <holycow> is there a bios setting for the keyboard?
[00:21:56] <holycow> sounds like something that can be set to a default setting in the bios
[00:22:07] <svendre> There's a setting to enable/disable the numpad/touchpad toggle feature, I tried disabling that, but it made no difference.

[00:27:43] <holycow> it should be a lot easier to install and fix later
[00:27:52] <svendre> yeah that was my next move. I'm surprised it's not affecting more people, maybe it's just not been reported much yet, the laptop is like a week or two old only.
[00:29:01] <svendre> pretty common model, these are the new OLED screens that aren't a full 4k. It's a nice laptop actually, got it with AMD... aside from this issue... which is very odd. If I didn't know any better it almost seems like a deterrant to wiping Windows :D
[00:29:36] <PMT> holycow: wicd seems to be based on Python 2, and not had a release in 5 years.
[00:30:27] <PMT> apparently the git version has python3 support, though, so maybe not that bad? hm.

[02:43:09] <BCMM> a bunch of other distros (notably ubuntu and derivatives) have given distro upgrades a bad name, but some people have been upgrading the same debian install for a decade or more
[02:43:27] <xx> how likely is it that a deprecation warning will be put into `man which` on buster?
[02:43:27] <blackop> hmm
[02:43:41] <BCMM> xx: on buster?
[02:43:42] <blackop> so what do you suggest? upgrade or clean install
[02:43:52] <xx> BCMM: on buster
[02:43:58] <xx> oldstable still has a year to go
[02:43:59] <BCMM> blackop: upgrade, unless there's something particularly weird about the system
[02:44:14] <blackop> BCMM: can i do it over wifi?
[02:44:23] <blackop> since it is using non free firmware
[02:44:25] <xx> and `which` being deprecated is important info
[02:44:37] <xx> (same as `tempfile`, which everyone seemed to ignore too)
[02:44:47] <BCMM> blackop: yeah. it's just something you do from your Debian install - you don't need to boot from the ISO or anything
[02:45:10] <BCMM> it's just upgrading packages (except it's a lot of packages)
[02:46:16] <blackop> is it fine to edit /etc/apt/sources.list buster to bullseye?
[02:46:27] <blackop> just that enough?
[02:47:12] <BCMM> that's basically it, but i'd suggest skimming the guide i linked
[02:47:37] <xx> blackop: did you read the release notes?
[02:47:50] <BCMM> it's mostly just unusual configurations to check before you do it, though (like pinned packages)
[02:48:10] <tesseract> blackop: read the whole release note
[02:48:11] <BCMM> blackop: assuming you mean edit sources.list and then do `apt full-upgrade`, that is
[02:48:14] <blackop> xx: no
[02:48:23] <blackop> BCMM: yes
[02:48:40] <xx> blackop: read them, because otherwise it will be just us repeating the same info that's in there
[02:48:43] <blackop> tesseract: i am lazy for that :p

[16:54:58] <brutser> i don't understand this, if i got an encrypted volume, luks encrypted with detached header, now initramfs is handling the decryption < now if i want to reinstall the OS or change linux distro, the installer cannot find the volume obviously, so the only way i can do this is to 1. get the detached header 2. do expert installation and exit to shell during installation, then use the header to
[16:54:59] <brutser> decrypt the volume and then do a reinstallation?

[17:03:18] <hansh> having an issue with an OpenVPN server running on Debian 10 in a VMWare VM, on a Windows 10 hypervisor; when the VM is suspended+resumed, everything works fine except the OpenVPN server. sshd, MySQL, nginx, all resumes nicely, but OpenVPN is broken and impossible to connect to.. any idea why/how to fix it?

[19:12:55] <transhumanist> Hi! been a long time since i used debian! I am interested in using openjdk -7 and an old package that is requires 32 bit binaries, I have debian under windows on WSL2 any thoughts on how to proceed
[19:14:16] <PerfDave> transhumanist: You'll probably need to run an old version of Debian for starters, I don't think openjdk-7 is in the current Debian archives
[19:14:41] <pjb> Hi! I'm on GNU/Linux debian 10.10 buster  ; I have several python installed in /usr/bin/ (aliases python2, python3 and executables 2.7 3.7 3.7m) but $ update-alternatives --list python  says: update-alternatives: error: no alternatives for python  ; how comes?  How can I select python 3.7 instead of python 2.7 by default?
[19:14:46] <transhumanist> so whats the quickest way to boostrap an old  version
[19:14:56] <pjb> debootstrap?
[19:15:16] <pjb> perhaps in a chroot; schroot seems to be working nice.  or in a docker.
[19:15:30] <PerfDave> transhumanist: Not sure about WSL2 either, but I'd look to archive.debian.org for old distributions
[19:15:45] <PerfDave> stretch had openjdk-8 too, so you need to look earlier than that
[19:15:49] <transhumanist> no problem I can see this might be an adventure

[20:35:05] <johnjay> if i want to run fsck in debian how do I get into a rescue shell or something to do it?
[20:35:15] <johnjay> it says i can't run fsck on a mounted disk
[20:37:02] <somiaj> It is best to use a live image, or the installer image.
[20:37:46] <somiaj> I belive even the rescue mode (in grub under advanced) will still mount the root file system, so you'll need another boot medium to best fsck the image without mounting it
[20:38:39] <shutnoshut> Has anyone found a tutorial to install nginx+modsecurity3 on Debian11?

[22:11:30] <tharkun> Good $DAY again. I am facing with several trivial isues with xfce on bullseye. My setup is simple. I have rxvt-unicode as a terminal that in turns hosts tmux. The isue is simple, as soon as I fire up urxvt and maximize it with F10 there is a shadow of the former terminal on the background, which is the exact same size of the un-maximized terminal. With my current nvim configuration it gets stuck to the
[22:11:37] <tharkun> original size and it needs to be unmaximized and then maximized again for it to be the full size of the terminal. I wiped the configuration file and it works as it should. What am I looking for to debug this isue?

[22:59:52] <zerocool> hey friends. i upgraded workstation from 10 to 11 using a GTX950 and lost my gui anyone know how i can get this thing back on track really quick? even if it's like reconfiguring everything. also may need to know, using kde
[23:00:04] <Khepra> tharkun: so why do you think you're connecting to the wrong cluster, then?

[23:00:39] <greycat> zerocool: if that's an nvidia chipset, and if you're using the nvidia drivers, you might need to install the kernel headers for your new kernel, so it can build a new driver module
[23:00:46] *** Joins: malloy (~jimery@116.30.221.241)
[23:02:20] <zerocool> nah it's a dell.. optiplex no nvidia chipsets just nvidia video card
[23:02:37] <zerocool> which i understand has a set of nvidia chips on it :)
[23:02:50] *** Joins: DirkS (~DirkSt@user/dirkst)
[23:02:54] <zerocool> i also did install headers
[23:03:12] <tharkun> Khepra: select version(); gives me the 13.3  version instead of the 11.12 that should display
[23:03:14] <PerfDave> zerocool: I'd check /ver/log/Xorg.0.log
[23:03:24] <greycat> nvidia video chipset; I thought that was pretty clear :-/
[23:03:39] <greycat> !xorg.0.log
[23:03:40] <dpkg> Xorg.0.log is in /var/log/ unless you are on stretch-or-later and running X as non-root.  Then it's in ~/.local/share/xorg/ instead.

[23:05:14] <PerfDave> tharkun: I'd look in /etc/postgresql-common/user_clusters and at pg_upgradecluster but it's been a while since I did this

[23:05:59] <PerfDave> IIRC on Debian if you're running multiple PostgreSQL versions side-by-side it'll bump up the port numbers for them, so you may try something like "netstat -plnt" to find the one you want if it's not documented there
[23:06:01] <urk>  PDF files are not showing up in a folder after being saved with the LXDE desktop.  I am wondering if anyone has a suggestion for a fix?  I am wondering if the following URL has any relevancy as it relates to my problem, but the programs mentioned in the following forum appear to be excutables, and my issue is with a pdf not showing up https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/66555/why-are-my-application-desktop-files-not-showing-up-in-linux-application-m

[23:14:39] <Khepra> tharkun: then you're not connecting to the right socket/port. they can't coexist, you know, two clusters on the same port or socket.
[23:18:45] <babilen> zerocool: It might totally make sense to install the kernel/header metapackages as suggested by greycat if you haven't done that already. That'll ensure that you're not running into version mismatches in the future
