[12:53:12] <programmar> actually i am intending to use keyframes tho
[12:53:25] <programmar> and create two class fadeout and fadein, then change the class correspondingly
[12:53:28] <programmar> that seems to work too
[12:54:18] <hmw[at]> programmar: When fading it out again, you will want to wait for the fading time to pass, before removing the modal from the DOM. So you would re-add the .fade-out class. You will want to wait for the transition to be complete, before removing the element from the DOM.
[12:54:30] <theskillwithin> https://github.com/theskillwithin/untitled/blob/master/src/components/toaster/index.js
[12:54:41] <programmar> yea that's what i do, i wait for about 2-3 seconds then fade it out
[12:54:59] <hmw[at]> programmar: You can hard code the delay time in your setTimeout, or store the time like so: :root {  --modal-fade-time: 500ms; }   with  transition:opacity var(--modal-fade-time) ease-in-out;
[12:55:23] <hmw[at]> programmar: I usually extract that time from the CSS so I only have to adjust the timing in one place.

[13:15:12] <theskillwithin> https://imgur.com/a/MTY4HbU
[13:15:15] <hmw[at]> I think you need that timeout. My solution is only a little nicer, because the delay time is only stored once in the whole thing
[13:15:24] <rickame-> why is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name/theme-color a html thing not css? like what if our theme-color is based on what css color-scheme is being used?
[13:15:27] <rickame-> like wtf
[13:17:06] <hmw[at]> rickame-: Not all of HTML/CSS etc necessarily makes a lot of sense :)
[13:17:53] <hmw[at]> rickame-: Thing is, you can't style the browser itself with CSS, that's why they went with a meta tag. I would use a server side script to extract the color from the CSS and update the HTML META tag accordingly, before delivering the page
[13:17:56] <theskillwithin> you probably can just change the meta tag
[13:18:33] <theskillwithin> and really if its a problem, just don't use it
[13:18:38] <hmw[at]> ^
[13:18:59] <rickame-> you can't style the browser itself with CSS -- why tf not?
[13:19:02] <hmw[at]> Not unsolvable, but not very pretty either
[13:19:16] <hmw[at]> rickame-: I would burn you on the stake, if you forced a color on my WINDOW
[13:19:36] <hmw[at]> The address bar is not part of the web page
[13:19:38] <rickame-> ya it's dumb af. like if you wanna force it in a html element, let us put it in a 'set' form for the different color-schemes like dark light
[13:19:40] <programmar> hmw[at]: actually my solution was a bit similar, except storing the 900ms in CSS, i store it in js
[13:19:57] <rickame-> ya but what diff is it if it's html or css doing it?
[13:20:19] <hmw[at]> programmar: How would you update the CSS transition time from that JS value then? I guess you'd inject a var to the style or something. Same same.
[13:20:48] <hmw[at]> You can also just hardcode the values too. Not too much of a problem IMO
[13:20:53] <programmar> well, adding the fadeOut class into it is already the transistion ?
[13:21:05] <programmar> my purpose was fadein --> wait for 3seconds --> fade out --> delete the div
[13:21:38] <hmw[at]> You would have to store those 900ms both in your JS _and_ CSS. My solution only reduces this redundancy.
[13:21:47] <programmar> ok fair enough
[13:23:50] <theskillwithin> hmw[at] thats a modal not a toaster
[13:24:25] <hmw[at]> I also never heard of a toaster before. My thing isn't even really modal, that'd require a little more markup to block the background.
[13:24:43] <hmw[at]> My thing should be called a "popup" I think.
[13:24:48] <rickame-> modal is popup tho
[13:24:57] <hmw[at]> yeah, but not all popups are modal
[13:25:04] <rickame-> ya they are
[13:25:07] <rickame-> by definition
[13:25:23] <hmw[at]> uh. I call it a modal popup, if I mean it to be exclusive. Go figure.
[13:25:35] <rickame-> ya me too...
[13:25:43] <rickame-> is there another kinda popup?
[13:25:43] <hmw[at]> "modal" in that sense is not a noun but a "property"
[13:25:52] <hmw[at]> yeah, non blocking (non-modal) popups.
[13:26:06] <hmw[at]> Sometimes those are just another window.
[13:26:22] <rickame-> well by that definition isn't just anything > lowest layer a "popup"?
[13:26:29] <rickame-> it's just html elements styled on layers
[13:26:34] <rickame-> z index
[13:26:34] <hmw[at]> correct, that's how I view it
[13:26:36] <theskillwithin> hmw[at] did you see my imgur video?  thats a toaster
[13:26:44] <rickame-> so that's not popup then imo
[13:26:57] <hmw[at]> ah. I'd call those notification popups, is that a fitting term?
[13:27:02] <rickame-> popup has always historically referred to modally layered UI component
[13:27:22] <hmw[at]> rickame-: Try using a Linux Desktop and see, that they aren't always blocking.
[13:27:36] <theskillwithin> hmw[at] ya you could call them nose as well, but toaster is more of the UI term normally used on frontend
[13:27:37] <rickame-> ya but we're in web context
[13:28:04] <hmw[at]> I guess "toaster" in the context of a game achievement means somehting where we would toast (with glasses and alcohol)?
[13:28:28] <rickame-> buuuut i can see where ur coming from that popup can be more than just layering (there's interaction possible) and less than modal (exclusive/focus)
[13:28:44] <hmw[at]> rickame-: https://harald.ist.org/games/ares3/?runanyways --- *grins*
[13:29:01] <theskillwithin> i think its called toaster cuz it sorta usually animates in from the bottom of the screen,  like toast popping out of a toaster
[13:29:10] <hmw[at]> ah ok
[13:29:50] <theskillwithin> but im just guessing as well, idk the origins

[13:32:16] <rickame-> ya css is a little loose but it's not THAT much better in native
[13:32:34] <hmw[at]> In native code, coordinates don't randomly change though.

[13:36:42] <hmw[at]> Dear world, please stop fixing things that aren't broken.
[13:38:32] <rickame-> OMG You can provide a media type or query inside the media attribute; the color will then only be set if the media condition is true. i missed that. so theme-color is fine
[13:38:55] <rickame-> alright so tell me hmw[at] why you so mad at sites changing window color?
[13:39:14] <rickame-> i know it's browser not page but it ties it in nice no?
[13:39:38] <rickame-> as long as it's a color that works good for light and another for dark
[13:39:46] <hmw[at]> rickame-: It is a usability issue. I have chosen my Desktop theme and I don't want some random web site to change it. I might have reasons for my settings (colors, contrast, font size) due to visual impairment.
[13:40:08] <rickame-> ya but if it's a a11y good choice, then is it ok?
[13:40:20] <hmw[at]> no, it is never ok to take away freedom from the user
[13:40:47] <rickame-> can you disable it for sites that do it?
[13:40:54] <hmw[at]> You can't possibly know my reasons. It is bad enough that everyone uses px font sizes inside the pages, so that some people need to block that with addons
[13:41:40] <rickame-> what do you do if a site uses it?
[13:41:52] <hmw[at]> I open the inspector and delete the according CSS rule
[13:42:10] <rickame-> can you make it permanent or you gotta do it every time?
[13:42:21] <hmw[at]> especially if they use low contrast like background:#aaa and text-color:#666, which is soo insane
[13:42:21] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[13:42:39] <hmw[at]> There are tools like tampermonkey, where you can automate such things, but that requires programming skills
[13:42:58] <theskillwithin> hmw[at] what unit would you prefer for font-size?
[13:43:00] <rickame-> why dont browsers let you save rules like that?
[13:43:04] <hmw[at]> em
[13:43:14] <rickame-> ya i use em and rem
[13:43:36] <hmw[at]> Ideally your web pages are size agnostic and work with any font size.
[13:44:00] <hmw[at]> You also can't guarantee that a certain custom font is being loaded
[13:44:14] <theskillwithin> idk how px interferes with that
[13:44:48] <hmw[at]> it removes my preference in my browser setting. Imagine I set 40px font size in my browser, and your page reduces it to 14px. I would have to fiddle with zoom settings etc.
[13:45:09] <hmw[at]> If you use 1em for "normally sized" text, I get my 40px
[13:45:35] <rickame-> hmw[at]: you ever use the +/- to jack text up or down?
[13:45:36] <hmw[at]> Sometimes this creates headaches on the designer/web dev side of things, admittedly.
[13:46:12] <hmw[at]> Of course I use it, but it is bad practice to remove any freedoms from the user. Especially, where it is not really needed.
[13:47:21] <rickame-> browsers should just let users disable the theme-color feature for all sites or per site
[13:47:26] <rickame-> in the little permission panel
[13:47:57] <hmw[at]> I'd like such a feature. Tampermonkey doesn't cut it for me (with the contrast issue). I always have to dig into the inspector to find the color settings I need to delete.
[13:48:32] <hmw[at]> It is a non-trivial problem though. The tool would have to be VERY intelligent in order to not mess up the page completely.
[13:49:32] <hmw[at]> A quick solution is pressing CTRL+A, this way I can at least read the text, but then the page looks pretty awful
[13:49:49] <theskillwithin> hmw[at] em is based on parent tho, do you mean rem?  does the browser settings change what font-size body has?
[13:49:50] <hmw[at]> Use #000 with #fff
[13:50:10] <hmw[at]> theskillwithin: Sure the browser setting predicts the base font size
[13:50:39] <hmw[at]> *dictates ... or something., I guess you get what I wanted to say
[13:51:23] <theskillwithin> specifically how
[13:51:26] <hmw[at]> We can also temporarily completely disable styles in the browser (FF: View/Page Style/None) which makes the page appear as if no CSS was loaded
[13:51:41] <hmw[at]> 1em is by default the font size, the user has set in their browser preferences
[13:51:48] <hmw[at]> 1rem to be precise
[13:52:17] <theskillwithin> umm, they are very different so ya please be precise
[13:52:33] <hmw[at]> Well. We were talking about the base font size, so there's that
[13:55:03] <theskillwithin> hmw[at] as defined by the user agent styles?
[13:55:24] <hmw[at]> https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/css-is-awesome-scaled.jpg
[13:55:28] <theskillwithin> if thats the case, what if your resetting them normalizing them or overriding them
[13:55:54] <hmw[at]> theskillwithin: The UA styles use the setting from the browser. I don't think that the UA style files are touched, when the user changes a font size setting.
[13:56:56] <hmw[at]> But the principle is quite the same
[13:58:19] <hmw[at]> With certain requirements from the design department, it may be a lot easier to just set a fixed px font size in a page, especially if you need to position images in a pixel perfect manner, or want a thin border. using 0.0125rem isn't very reliable (rounding errors), so in such cases, I also use 1px.
[13:58:38] <rickame-> use flex and stuff tho no?
[13:58:56] <rickame-> i never use px tho maybe that's just me
[13:59:03] <hmw[at]> That doesn't help with the problems I am talking about
[13:59:05] <rickame-> if anything i'd use pt
[13:59:11] <rickame-> but i dont even use that
[13:59:13] <rickame-> o
[13:59:20] <hmw[at]> pt and px is equivalent in this context, I believe

[14:03:01] <hmw[at]> You certainly will understand what I mean, by "letting things just fall into place"
[14:03:20] <hmw[at]> But you'd need actual experience with CSS to really grasp the full meaning
[14:03:58] <hmw[at]> Anyhow, I started a 4th attempt at said article, just the other day!
[14:06:16] <hmw[at]> Yeah, screenshots and live examples, like they do on MDN
[14:12:37] <rickame-> do we HAVE to use input[type="checkbox"] {} to style some stuff or can everything be through id or class like normal?
[14:13:10] <Rockwood> similar i think
[14:13:53] <Rockwood> input[type="checkbox"] in this case you are calling all selectors
[14:14:05] <rickame-> woooo
[14:14:13] <Rockwood> in case of id a unique
[14:15:10] <hmw[at]> rickame-: You could use classes (I'd advise against IDs) for such things. At least it is technically possible. Doesn't mean that it makes sense to add a class, when you already can select for a tag. I'd try to always keep my HTML and CSS as tight as possible, avoiding redundancies.
[14:16:27] <theskillwithin> i think just need a fundamental understanding of selectors
[14:16:36] <Rockwood> yes class name is very better in my view
[14:20:43] <hmw[at]> rickame-: I guess this should help you a little: Never use anything that refers to how something looks in your HTML, that includes class names. So, don't do <strong class="red">WARNING</strong>, but do <span class="warning"> instead. (Maybe <strong class="warning">, but that is a matter of debate/taste/style)
[14:21:31] <hmw[at]> iow. Keep your markup semantic and free of any reference to actual looks
[14:21:43] <rickame-> ya i do that... but then again theme-color forces us to put something looks oriented into html
[14:21:54] <hmw[at]> right, I don't like it a lot either

[14:22:51] <rickame-> i thought id was good for speed but then i hear id is bad for reusable components or?
[14:22:57] <hmw[at]> I rarely _need_ IDs and they come with a certain danger. You might "lock yourself in" when using IDs

[14:27:11] <hmw[at]> I don't know that meta tag, heard of it the first time today. If I were to implement it, I'd use that color's hue as a basis for my browser window UI, so I can ensure, it stays legible and whatnot.
[14:27:59] <hmw[at]> *implement it when programming a browser
[14:30:09] <rickame-> ya looks like browsers do a blend so a bad choice can't screw up user
[14:30:13] <rickame-> hopefully
[14:34:32] <hmw[at]> They have nerfed a few browser features due to security concerns. It happens every now and then, when someone finds a way to abuse something. I dearly miss the ability to reference images via file:// (Think huge game, the user has to download a zip file and decompress it, then tell the web game the location, in order to "cache" all the graphics)
[14:36:41] <hmw[at]> or toggling full screen via script. Aparrently some people switched the page to full screen and rendered a mockup of the browser UI. So now, we can't really programatically switch to FS, and there is this annoying box that states "you are in full screen mode now".

[14:58:17] <hmw[at]> theskillwithin: Why em: So the coder using this can set their own font sizes higher up in the DOM, making your component size agnostic.

[20:07:06] <hmw[at]> Without that, every span, no matter how deeply nested, will get the table-cell treatment, which isn't what you want
[20:11:53] <rendar> right
[20:11:57] <rendar> right right!
[20:13:56] <rendar> hmw[at], https://jsfiddle.net/h7savxzp/1/   i have fixed that, but i have a problem
[20:14:08] <rendar> i get 1 pixel row of reds, under the green
[20:14:09] <rendar> why?
[20:14:38] <hmw[at]> hmm. I don't see that here
[20:15:06] <hmw[at]> also, consider not adding classes, when not needed. Only makes the markup more complicated. .bar > span would do the trick just fine.
[20:15:33] <hmw[at]> ah. I see it in Chrome
[20:16:31] <rendar> yeah
[20:16:32] <hmw[at]> Not sure yet. Must be the difference between being a table-cell and a normal span somehow
[20:16:38] <rendar> :(
[20:16:41] <rendar> damn!
[20:16:46] <rendar> can it be fixed?
[20:17:49] <hmw[at]> Of course not :)
[20:17:50] <hmw[at]> try .tabz span {  display:inline-block; }
[20:18:21] <rendar> nope it messes up everything

[20:18:41] <rendar> btw
[20:18:47] <rendar> i need size to be adaptive
[20:18:56] <rendar> check this out: https://jsfiddle.net/h7savxzp/2/
[20:18:58] <rendar> this is wrong
[20:19:17] <rendar> why that full size, if we have only short words?
[20:19:30] <hmw[at]> I can't folow
[20:19:41] <rendar> when words are shorter, so it must be also the cell width
[20:19:42] <hmw[at]> Looks exactly how I would have intended it
[20:19:56] <hmw[at]> All cells are set to the same width!?
[20:20:00] <rendar> hmw[at], consider the 'ls' on unices
[20:20:15] <rendar> if i have 3 files "a", "b", "c", it lists only those
[20:20:30] <rendar> if there is a longer name, it tabulates to make the longer name to be inserted correctly
[20:20:39] <hmw[at]> ok?
[20:20:51] <rendar> if i have spans with very short names "a", "b", "C", it should take ALL the html space
[20:21:02] <rendar> but only the needed space for those little strings
[20:21:21] <hmw[at]> Sounds like you just changed your requirements
[20:21:32] <rendar> i have also said this before...
[20:22:45] <hmw[at]> I am officially confused now :)
[20:23:26] <rendar> ok ok
[20:23:31] <rendar> let's focus on this problem
[20:23:35] <rendar> can it be done?
[20:23:58] <hmw[at]> I don't know what the problem is. Update: https://jsfiddle.net/4Lpwfrma/ <-- re-centered the things. It is now exactly as you were happy with before.
[20:25:13] <hmw[at]> If you want something like an ls output, you would use a normal table, not table-layout:fixed; -- so every column shrinks to the minimum.
[20:25:49] <rendar> first of all
[20:25:59] <rendar> i want text left aligned
[20:26:13] <rendar> then i don't want it to take all the size, of strings are shorter!
[20:26:14] <hmw[at]> Sure, just pointing out that nothing changed with my .bar > span
[20:26:20] <rendar> if there is a long string, sure, why not
[20:26:32] <rendar> but if strings are shorter, it must take less space
[20:26:39] <hmw[at]> Remove table-layout:fixed; for a normal table, but you asked for this before
[20:26:42] <rendar> but each cell must be equal!!
[20:26:52] <hmw[at]> hmm
[20:26:59] <hmw[at]> I have a solution but the ordering will be different
[20:27:03] <rendar> if i have 3 spans: "a", "b", "Three" <- this is a bigger span, in width
[20:27:13] <hmw[at]> I think I get it now
[20:27:24] <rendar> so "a", "b", "Three" will have the same width of "Three", the bigger one
[20:27:32] <rendar> but they won't take ALL the width of the page!
[20:27:40] <hmw[at]> You want to just add any number of elements and they should form a table. Problem is: Where does the information come from, how many elements there are per row
[20:28:35] <rendar> any number yes
[20:28:45] <rendar> it could be 20
[20:28:48] <hmw[at]> With tables, you need to make <tr> equivalent elements
[20:29:14] <hmw[at]> they can't automagically turn a list into a table (which is what you seem to want). I think, you can do it with flex, but I don't know flex well enough
[20:29:43] <hmw[at]> I mean table layout can't automagically turn a 1D-list into a 2D-table.
[20:30:22] <rendar> so a table layout is wrong
[20:30:30] <hmw[at]> Seems like so
[20:30:37] <rendar> so a normal list
[20:30:44] <rendar> but i want equal width for each span
[20:31:09] <rendar> now this width is NOT total_width/number_of_spans, BUT bigger_span.width
[20:32:52] <hmw[at]> You essentially want a table that adds table-rows automagically, right?
[20:33:14] <rendar> i have only 1 row!
[20:33:20] <rendar> 1 row, with N columns
[20:33:35] <rendar> https://jsfiddle.net/5Lv3sz2y/ check this out
[20:33:44] <hmw[at]> makes no sense, how would a table with one row need to have "all elements in a column the same size"
[20:33:44] <rendar> i want those blue borders to be of the same size!
[20:33:54] <rendar> ITS NOT A TABLE!
[20:34:11] <rendar> this is like a menu
[20:34:15] <hmw[at]> Calm down :) We are probably hitting a language barrier here
[20:34:36] <rendar> in a menu, all elements are distanced equally
[20:34:44] <rendar> otherwise it would be very ugly
[20:34:48] <hmw[at]> OK, one row. That means, I have to step back again and re-attempt to understand what you need
[20:34:59] <rendar> ok
[20:35:01] <rendar> loook:
[20:35:21] <rendar> |A   |B   |Four|
[20:35:32] <rendar> do you see how all 3 elements, have the same width?
[20:35:37] <rendar> and they are not:
[20:35:44] <rendar> |A                          |B                            |Four

[20:35:47] <hmw[at]> That's what we already made before, isn't it??
[20:35:50] <rendar> no!
[20:35:57] <rendar> before it took ALL the width
[20:36:01] <rendar> and divided that width by 3
[20:36:03] <hmw[at]> ok
[20:36:04] <rendar> so i have:
[20:36:06] <rendar> |A                          |B                            |Four
[20:36:12] <hmw[at]> how do we determine the width then?
[20:36:23] <rendar> len("Four") = 4
[20:36:26] <hmw[at]> just add the same amount of white space between each of the elements?
[20:36:30] <rendar> "Four" is the biggest string
[20:36:34] <rendar> another example:
[20:36:44] <rendar> |A|B|C|
[20:36:58] <rendar> |A    |B     |C     |Fifth|
[20:37:00] * hmw[at] scratches head
[20:37:10] <hmw[at]> Where do you want the total width to come from?
[20:37:25] <rendar> |A          |B           |C          |Hello world|
[20:37:27] <hmw[at]> Like, in a relation to the parent, or to the sum of elements?
[20:37:44] <rendar> no total width needed

[20:38:10] <hmw[at]> so, minimal "table" width, but all elements the same width
[20:39:00] <rendar> yes
[20:39:07] <hmw[at]> My approach from before only works with a given width. Tricky. Let me think.
[20:39:33] <hmw[at]> I would usually set a fixed width to all the menu elements, making it slightly larger than needed. Kind of cheating, if you get me.
[20:39:48] <rendar> https://ibb.co/pJK64zQ
[20:39:53] <rendar> check this out
[20:39:56] <rendar> this is just 'ls'
[20:40:02] <hmw[at]> That will not work only, if your menu contents are constnantly changing. Which a menu usually doesn't do.
[20:40:12] <rendar> do you see how it determines the bigger width of the text
[20:40:18] <rendar> then it aligns accordingly?
[20:40:19] <hmw[at]> Yeah, but that is a 2D table, hence my confusion
[20:40:23] <rendar> yes
[20:40:26] <rendar> i want to do that in 1D
[20:40:32] <rendar> in only 1-row table!
[20:40:57] <rendar> it's just like taking 1 *column* of that ls output and put into 1 *row*
[20:41:03] <hmw[at]> doesn't make sense. Imagine ls output only being one line. Every item would just have the same gap and we would not have to do anything.
[20:41:15] <rendar> eh?
[20:41:21] <hmw[at]> Let me show.
[20:41:51] <rendar> hmw[at], with ls 1 line output, you'd have only 1 element
[20:41:55] <rendar> so, normal span
[20:42:05] <rendar> problem arises when you have >=2 elements!
[20:42:16] <rendar> here you have to align labels
[20:42:28] <rendar> so, when ls output is 2 or more lines!
[20:42:36] <hmw[at]> https://jsfiddle.net/pq3fe2yc/   this is how ls would look like, if it was only one line
[20:43:49] <hmw[at]> We can add a fixed width: https://jsfiddle.net/pq3fe2yc/1/ That may or may not be a step in the right direction. You tell me.
[20:44:40] <rendar> no
[20:44:44] <rendar> i don't want a fixed width!
[20:44:57] <hmw[at]> Auto-sizing like in a table only works with columns, you can have columns adjust their size to the size of the largest cell in that column. It doesn't go horizontally though.
[20:45:12] <rendar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/225956/how-do-i-align-spans-or-divs-horizontally
[20:45:16] <hmw[at]> Yeahg, but imagine that 7em width would be auto-calculated, would that then be what you want?
[20:45:41] <hmw[at]> As in: All elements the same size as the widest element.
[20:46:00] <hmw[at]> I am not sure, if that even works with CSS tbh.
[20:46:06] <rendar> yes
[20:46:46] <hmw[at]> Well. Float and inline-block can't do it. You have to assign a width. _maybe_ there is a way with flex, but I don't know flex really.
[20:46:46] <rendar> i think this is a very basic thing
[20:46:50] <hmw[at]> Yeah
[20:46:57] <rendar> css is so advanced and i cannot do a very simple thing like this?!
[20:47:21] <hmw[at]> CSS is not made for making applications, but for formatting text. At least that's where it all started.
[20:47:41] <rendar> this IS formatting text!
[20:47:43] <hmw[at]> I usually just make them a fixed width, like with my 7em, but give them a little wiggle room.
[20:48:05] <rendar> a fixed width? so if you have a bigger strings, messes things up!
[20:48:05] <hmw[at]> I see how that is not a very satisfying solution.
[20:48:13] <rendar> it's 2022, and we cannot have an adaptive width
[20:48:16] <rendar> for STRINGS!
[20:48:25] <hmw[at]> Yes, correct. But if it is a menu, that's usually not an issue, since I know what text I put in there.
[20:48:35] <hmw[at]> It certainly could be done with JS, but that's ugly.
[20:48:35] <rendar> i don't know the text!
[20:49:57] <hmw[at]> Ok. So lets work with the assumption that the menu text is not a given. What can we do? ... Hm. Perhaps that magic flex solution, that may or may not exist, or change the design. I would not mind every menu item having it's own size with a constant gap between each of the items.
[20:50:19] <rendar> but it is ugly as hell
[20:50:30] <rendar> neither console applications like 'htop' have that
[20:50:39] <hmw[at]> I disagree :) Well, however, if you insist on achieving what you said, I am at a loss here.
[20:50:53] <rendar> for Christ sake, even 'htop' a f. *console* application has Fn ... keys menu aligned correctly!
[20:51:14] <rendar> and i cannot do what a console application can do, in css? in 2022? Damn.
[20:51:15] <hmw[at]> That is software using a console and doing all kinds of calculations manually. They don't use CSS.
[20:51:20] <rendar> how broke is the web?
[20:51:27] <hmw[at]> No, doing console in CSS is _hard_. I tried that.
[20:51:30] <hmw[at]> VERY BROKE
[20:51:36] <rendar> ok
[20:51:39] <rendar> what can i do?
[20:51:59] <rendar> maybe using full width like your initial example
[20:52:05] <rendar> and the resizing the parent's div
[20:52:13] <rendar> littler, so it will take less full width
[20:52:14] <hmw[at]> 1) Find the magic flex solution (if any exists at all)   2) Change design requirements   3) Use JS to calculate the widths of all the elements, and assign the maximum to all the elements.
[20:52:36] <rendar> unbelievable
[20:52:59] <hmw[at]> I estimate there might be a 30% chance, that flex can do it. Ask someone else in this channel.
[20:53:14] <hmw[at]> The JS solution is really yucky
[20:53:19] <rendar> this is just broke, and all the willingness to use and learn CSS just disappeared
[20:53:35] <rendar> come on, JS code for a f. menu?
[20:53:54] <rendar> for a f. label alignment??!? -_-
[20:54:16] <hmw[at]> There's a few tricks with forms and label alignment, but usually those are 2D

[20:54:51] <hmw[at]> CSS can be really nice. Try not to get frustrated about this. Instead realize the truth. There is no pixel perfect layout. We do fluid layouts instead.

[21:00:04] <theskillwithin> my layouts are heavily based on containers so it is pixel perfect, but also fluid as well i guess
[21:00:43] <hmw[at]> Everything I made, that uses spans inside a one-line parent, is now offset and/or a few pixels taller than in Chromium/FF as it was a few weeks ago.

[21:03:32] <hmw[at]> I need to know what they changed, so I can fix my stuffs. I can't possibly add a browser switch and use an estimated amount of px to compensate, can I.
