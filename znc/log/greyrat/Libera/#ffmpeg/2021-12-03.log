[00:05:54] <StudentSA> Do you think its possible to fix the issue at the source... I.e. when I am creating the mkv file?
[00:07:12] <StudentSA> I am recording from a udp stream where ffprobe shows (for the udp stream): Stream #0:3[0x134]: Video: h264 (Main) ([27][0][0][0] / 0x001B), yuv420p(tv, bt470bg, top first), 352x576 [SAR 32:11 DAR 16:9], 25 fps, 50 tbr, 90k tbn, 50 tbc
[00:07:16] <tar_xvf> can't you use the setsar filter
[00:07:23] <tar_xvf> i must be confused what you are asking
[00:07:47] <JEEB> the sar is correct
[00:08:21] <JEEB> he is making the video so that it is a high block, which must be widened to three or so times its width to be 16:9
[00:08:51] <JEEB> StudentSA: but yes, you could be just generating 1:1 SAR clips if you wanted for the video already.
[00:09:34] <StudentSA> so using ffmpeg I record the above with a "-vf scale=480:-2" because in my mind I want to normalise all my videos to 480px width

[00:10:05] <JEEB> yup, that is the problem with negative number mode
[00:11:09] <StudentSA> but i see now that I may not be doing that... because the "-vf scale=480:-2" is actually generating the mkv to have the 480x508 [SAR 127:90 DAR 4:3]
[00:11:39] <JEEB> try the same scale thing you utilized with the output into image
[00:11:51] <JEEB> that should scale similarly but actually do what you wanted to do, I think

[00:13:36] <StudentSA> are you suggesting "-vf scale=480:-2,setsar=1/1"?
[00:13:37] <Riviera> JEEB: understood, thank you! at least i now know parsing stderr is as good as it gets, for now. :)
[00:14:15] <JEEB> Riviera: well if the returned AVFrames contain the metadata you could make a simple application doing that
[00:14:57] <JEEB> but yea unfortunately I cannot fork() myself to develop all the things that come up here. maybe there should be a custom tool that focuses on doing the filter chain bits
[00:15:08] <JEEB> and possibly dumping information received from the filter chain
[00:15:14] <JEEB> (as metadata or side data in the AVFrames)

I would like to have e2ee from ffmpeg to the end user. I guess I can use srtp?

[03:59:42] <Obsdark> what kind of argument is requiring?
[04:02:31] <kepstin> with that set of options, you're trying to write to a file literally named "MP4", and ffmpeg can't figure out what you're trying to do

[04:04:50] <kepstin> (maybe you meant to use "-hls_segment_type fmp4" ?)
[04:12:27] <Obsdark> it doesn't recognize hls_segment_type as an option
