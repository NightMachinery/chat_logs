[14:25:27] <Naktibalda> what would it do?
[14:27:01] <olle> Naktibalda: It checks that all methods are pure, and/or that all effectful methods can be mocked fully.
[14:27:33] <olle> So instead of calling file_get_contents(), you must instead call from an IO wrapper, like $this->io->file_get_contents
[14:27:36] <olle> Etc
[14:30:26] <olle> Hm, so I guess it boils down to not using any effectful functions at all, only effectful methods (not called statically).
[14:31:53] <olle> And not calling any globals.

[15:34:06] <biberu> anyway, your devs should know when it's proper to do those things, not all problems are technical
[15:34:55] <biberu> if your codebase has a problem with side effects, maybe some training?
[15:35:55] <toretto> How big and wide is PHP's PECL and Composer when compared to Perl's CPAN?
[15:39:37] <Naktibalda> composer is a tool, you are probably asking about Packagist and it says that it has 312.366 packages registered
[15:39:52] <Naktibalda> https://packagist.org/statistics
[15:42:25] <toretto> why is there a decimal point?
[15:42:38] <Naktibalda> it is thousand separator
[15:43:22] <toretto> How many packages in plain numbers exists? It's confusing
[15:43:44] <Naktibalda> 312 thousand
[15:44:17] <AllenJB> Why do you care how many packages there are? And why are you trying to compare it to CPAN? That's weird.
[15:44:45] <biberu> or 312.366 kilopackages
[15:44:51] <toretto> AllenJB: Like, I'm trying to see which is the biggest and how small/big is one over another.
[15:45:21] <Naktibalda> Perl lost almost 20 years ago.
[15:45:31] <AllenJB> Why tho? Comparing them isn't sensible. For starters CPAN contains packages for which functionality is in PHP core
[15:46:03] <biberu> what's that number going to tell you? how many are maintained? which ones do you *need*?
[15:46:10] <AllenJB> And it tells you nothing about how many of those packages are actually used
[15:46:23] <toretto> AllenJB: Like, which one have many libraries, 3rd party support and pretty much people's code which is alrady written to help me.
[15:47:32] <biberu> help you do what?
[15:47:32] <AllenJB> Knowing the total number of packages doesn't tell you how many are going to help you tho. There may be none that cover what you want to do, or 1000.
[15:51:32] <Naktibalda> toretto: if you pick Perl you must decide if you choose Perl 5 from nineties or whatever is the current name of Perl 6
[15:52:09] <TinoDidriksen> Perl 6 is dead (renamed Raku). They're going for Perl 7 instead.
[15:53:06] <AllenJB> Perl 6 is now named Raku. And they're apparently working on Perl 7
[15:54:53] <biberu> toretto: if you're choosing a language based on the number of packages available for it, perhaps you should consider that you often don't learn one language and use that for the rest of your career, instead you learn several and pick the one better suited for the task at hand

[16:24:37] <dag> composer is heavy-weight. is there a market for a simpler tool and package repository?
[16:25:43] <TinoDidriksen> No, composer is very simple.
[16:26:24] <Blondie101010> dag:  being afraid of something unknown is understandable, but doesn't make it bad or difficult
[16:26:44] <TinoDidriksen> Also, what does it matter when you almost never use it? That's like complaining about "apt-get" ... you install packages during setup, and then almost never again.
[16:27:29] <TinoDidriksen> An amortized one-time task can be as heavy as it wants to be.
[16:28:02] <TinoDidriksen> ...but composer is not heavy.
[16:28:32] <biberu> dag: what do you find heavy with it?
[16:28:37] <dag> alright thanks
[16:28:52] <biberu> perhaps someone can offer advice to make it easier?
[16:29:05] <dag> i guess i mean complex. the feature set of composer stuff is very large
[16:29:14] <TinoDidriksen> So?
[16:29:24] <TinoDidriksen> You use ~1 of them: composer upgrade
[16:30:44] <TinoDidriksen> You can just ignore features you don't use. They don't impact you. And it's not like Composer is shipped with your app, so it doesn't impact downstream either.
[16:34:12] <Blondie101010> all you usually have to know is how to set up your composer.json to autoload your class structure, preferably with PSR-4
[16:36:02] <AllenJB> Technically you don't even need to know there - you could use require everywhere in your own code and just use autoloading for composer packages
[16:36:28] <AllenJB> *know that
[16:38:12] <Blondie101010> well knowing how to set up psr-4 for a project is kind of a must today
[16:38:19] <dag> my motivation for this worry is that i have spent quite a few hours researching composer when creating a few libraries. e.g. that the minimum-stability is for root packages only and how the stability flags works together with semantic versions such as 0.0.1 etc.
[16:38:29] <Blondie101010> and doing it without composer is a bit harder
[16:39:21] <Blondie101010> dag:  in the end your tool will be harder to use than composer with that in mind
[16:39:41] <dag> yes probably. it's essential complexity
[16:40:15] <Blondie101010> so specifying that it's stable is too hard?
[16:40:55] <dag> hehe. i think composer forces packages below 1.0.0 to be less than stable
[16:41:10] <Blondie101010> either way, you won't be able to convince the rest of the world to use your system, so you'll never be able to use it for your dependencies
[16:41:26] <TinoDidriksen> That's not what is meant by semantic versioning stability...

[19:37:27] <__adrian> don't copare dates as strings, if that's what you mean
[19:37:55] <__adrian> "today is 20210623 and the post end_date is 20210624"  are you comparing in the correct timezone?
[19:37:55] <robertparkerx> well it has a type so I'm using it as DATE
[19:38:09] <robertparkerx> I'm using new DateTime()
[19:38:32] <Naktibalda> show your code
[19:39:08] <robertparkerx> It's WordPress but nobody knows anything https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/d6d5cfe347e74e5585de7698c6385555
[19:39:16] <robertparkerx> I'm just trying to figure it out
[19:39:35] <robertparkerx> What makes it all so strange is it's one post
[19:39:49] <robertparkerx> I have another page that is using >= and those are working except the one post
[19:40:17] <robertparkerx> I've tried to see if strtotime +1 day or -1 day would do antyhing and it fubar
[19:41:05] <Naktibalda> are you searching for expired posts?
[19:41:09] <robertparkerx> yes
[19:41:37] <robertparkerx> I've checked the database and the fgormat is right
[19:42:32] <robertparkerx> I tought about the timezone but I would think that it would returtn something different for datetime
[19:42:50] <robertparkerx> I var dump and it's right

[21:46:05] <robertparkerx> I tried with and without
[21:46:09] <robertparkerx> :(
[21:46:21] <robertparkerx> without it's fubar
[21:47:33] <TML> what is the exact value of end_date for the records you don't think should be appearing?
[21:47:55] <TML> Use var_dump()
[21:47:57] <robertparkerx> 20210624
[21:48:01] <robertparkerx> I did
[21:48:09] <robertparkerx> now is 20210623
[21:48:40] <robertparkerx> It's only one post too, the others are okay
[21:48:47] <TML> what's the entire output of var_dump
[21:50:57] <robertparkerx> string(10) "24/06/2021"but in the database it is different
[21:51:09] <robertparkerx> wow how did I make it bold
[21:51:25] <__adrian> wait
[21:51:31] <__adrian> are you comparing in the db or in php
[21:51:38] <Rockwood> __adrian, how are you sir?
[21:51:41] <__adrian> and if in php, how?
[21:51:43] <robertparkerx> I assume db because it's a query

[21:52:10] <__adrian> "meta query" ?
[21:52:31] <robertparkerx> meta because it's in postmeta table
[21:52:55] <TML> __adrian: it's a wordpress question, I was just trying to help him muddle through anyway
[21:53:04] <__adrian> so, that string is not Ymd
[21:53:09] <robertparkerx> yes
[21:53:24] <__adrian> where's it from?
[21:53:26] <robertparkerx> If I use d/m/Y is isn't rightg
[21:53:36] <robertparkerx> php
[21:53:55] <__adrian> are you saying it's from  $now->format('Ymd')  ?
[21:53:59] <robertparkerx> from advanced custom fields and I'm using get_field(); to fetch
[21:54:04] <robertparkerx> no
[21:54:30] <__adrian> you need to find out what the actual value is, whereever it's from
[21:54:40] <__adrian> sounds like you're saying it's in the DB?
[21:54:41] <robertparkerx> in the db is Ymd
[21:54:43] <robertparkerx> yes
[21:55:08] <TML> robertparkerx: Well, hopefully, in the DB it's a date field, not a string
[21:55:20] <TML> which means it's not stored as Ymd
[21:55:23] <__adrian> verify that it really is (look at the DB, no WP)
[21:55:27] <TML> it's stored as a "date" type
[21:55:29] <robertparkerx> I think it's a string
[21:55:32] <__adrian> and if it is, then something's happened in between
[21:55:42] <__adrian> it shouldn't be a string. it should be a DATE
[21:55:49] <robertparkerx> I did look in tyhe db directly
[21:55:59] <TML> robertparkerx: if the database has that field as a string instead of a date, your attempt to use  'meta_type' => 'DATE' won't give expected results
[21:56:34] <robertparkerx> without it is the same result
