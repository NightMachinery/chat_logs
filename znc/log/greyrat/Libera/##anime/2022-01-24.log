[02:02:51] <MootPoot> that's another way to track people
[02:03:40] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: apparently you can track people with the vein patters on their bodies now caught with cameras
[02:06:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unsurprising.
[02:06:11] <neonvortex> next time theyre gonna track people by their breathing patterns
[02:06:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Were clothing less common, humans also have unique ultraviolet-visible skin patterns.
[02:06:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: pedophilia itself is not even illegal
[02:06:42] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: at the end of the video they're asking randos to contribute their hand images to train their models
[02:06:45] <MootPoot> lol
[02:06:49] <neonvortex> pedophilia is bad but it's being used to cover up dystopian shit
[02:06:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: To make it so would be tantamount to making mental illness illegal, rather than acting on it.
[02:07:01] <neonvortex> it's an actual crime but should be taken seriously but NOPE
[02:07:05] <MootPoot> well, throw that in the ways to track you bucket, alongside -
[02:07:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Stripes, right, that's it.
[02:07:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Humans have stripes.
[02:07:33] <neonvortex> it's the WORST crime to use as a way to cover up tracking people
[02:07:43] <MootPoot> retina scanning, biometrics, gait tracking, vocal , powerline frequency hums, and what else I dont even know
[02:08:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Breathing patterns are unreliable and easily altered by sickness. Exhibit A: Covid.
[02:08:26] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: Inn the case of mental illness. If someone does something bad like murder and the cause was mental illness, in Japan the treatment is different from criminal
[02:08:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Permanent alteration.
[02:09:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Indeed, but someone functional who does not represent a danger to other shouldn't see their enjoyment of life destroyed for no reaosn.
[02:09:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *reason
[02:09:28] <MootPoot> inb4 somebody chimes in and says "nobody is a danger to others until they are"
[02:09:43] <amigojapan> Agreed Aurora_v_kosmose 
[02:10:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Indeed, but the notion of interning everyone would logically include the guards themselves.
[02:10:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> However, it's also known that solitary isolation (particularly when deprived of any stimulation) is unfailingly damaging to humans.
[02:11:06] <MootPoot> My daily life be like 
[02:11:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: You're on irc and watch anime. That counts as stimulation.
[02:11:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Consider a room with 24/7 soft-white lighting. Concrete walls. A bed. A toilet. A sink. Nothing else.
[02:11:58] <MootPoot> I mean just the solitary isolation part 
[02:12:03] <MootPoot> Not the lack of stimulation 
[02:12:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Yes, but a large reason of why hikki & NEETs don't go insane is the stimulation.
[02:12:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And even then it requires a predisposition to endure it without meaningful damage.
[02:12:43] <MootPoot> I remember that story about the researcher with the monkey 
[02:13:00] <MootPoot> He put it in a completely blackout box for its entire life 
[02:13:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It went catatonic in how much time?
[02:14:55] <MootPoot> Uhh... 
[02:15:01] <MootPoot> I don't remember the name of it 
[02:15:38] <MootPoot> But it was a few years, basically taken as soon as it didn't need its mom and the only light it got was when they slid the food tray in 
[02:15:54] <MootPoot> I remember it died very prematurely, not sure how much specifically 
[02:16:06] <neonvortex> ok when did we go from discussing random anime to a/ux to tracking
[02:16:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, that's also an issue known in humans @ premature death
[02:16:21] <neonvortex> ayo what
[02:16:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I wonder if VR is sufficient interaction to prevent that.
[02:16:31] <neonvortex> prevent what

[02:16:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> neonvortex: Complete social isolation is correlated with a statistically significant difference in age of death.
[02:17:05] <neonvortex> ouch
[02:17:23] <neonvortex> let's see how redditors that haven't went outside in 5+ years react to that
[02:17:34] <neonvortex> although they have d*scord
[02:17:44] <MootPoot> The problem is people who actively call themselves redditors
[02:17:51] <MootPoot> Rather then just use the thing 
[02:17:53] <MootPoot> Ugh
[02:17:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> neonvortex: Yes, I'm curious about the influece of communication technologies. And which of them are most effective at limiting that issue.
[02:18:00] <neonvortex> what thing
[02:18:03] <neonvortex> MootPoot
[02:18:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> neonvortex: Reddit. Those who associate their identity to being users of it, rather than it just being a thing they happen to use.
[02:18:36] <neonvortex> ohh
[02:18:38] <neonvortex> i get it
[02:22:40] <MootPoot> I mean in that same bucket - 
[02:22:57] <MootPoot> people who call themselves gamers are the same
[02:23:23] <MootPoot> maybe this is a form of the western indavidualism that I've internalized
[02:24:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's hardly limited to the west.

[02:26:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> When I see artists with >1k images on gelbooru/danbooru... I just wonder, how the fuck do you make that many pieces?

[02:26:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Yeah, but still, damn
[02:26:50] <MootPoot> or just one a month with lots of varients
[02:26:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's some dedication
[02:26:59] <MootPoot> I know some which make like 1 good image a month
[02:27:00] <neonvortex> the number 365 has been ruined for me because of streaming services

[02:29:46] <neonvortex> Ä°\â¬Ä°@@â¬@\}}}Ä°\}]â¬]}\Ä°}Ä°>>>>>>
[02:29:54] <MootPoot> I'm struggling to figure out what the point of them are
[02:29:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Well, my keyboard is some ergonomic one, so it's... sorta built into the keyboard.
[02:30:09] <MootPoot> you got one of those kinesis ones?
[02:30:15] <MootPoot> 500 bucks on a keyboard
[02:30:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: I wish. I can't afford that right now.
[02:30:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Got some cheapo clone of the microsoft one.
[02:30:32] <MootPoot> oh, the wavy one
[02:30:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah.
[02:30:40] <neonvortex> tbh i never got the point of angling your keyboard a bit upwards, so its like a ramp
[02:30:41] <MootPoot> does that one actually help?
[02:30:45] <neonvortex> it hurts my writsts MORE
[02:30:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Goal is definitely kinesis freestyle, but that pricetag...
[02:30:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> neonvortex: Upwards is indeed worse.
[02:30:59] <MootPoot> neonvortex: supposedly you're not supposed to do that
[02:31:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> never use the stub legs behind keyboards.
[02:31:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Those stublegs are supposed to be in front of the keyboard, not back.
[02:31:07] <MootPoot> your wrists arent supposed to touch the desk
[02:31:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But designers are morons.
[02:31:13] <neonvortex> i only feel comfortable when my wrists sit straight tbh
[02:31:37] <MootPoot> afaik the reason why they add them on the back is becasue a good chunk of people need to still look at the keyboard as they type
[02:31:49] <MootPoot> or so I've heard
[02:31:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Idiocy is not a good reason for bad design.
[02:31:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Especially when Klavaro is freely available.

[02:32:28] <neonvortex> ive always heard online that it's healthier to use those angle things so i always felt like a weirdo for thinking that its worse
[02:32:30] <MootPoot> I could do completely nameless keycaps but 
[02:32:37] <MootPoot> I always need a "center point"
[02:32:49] <neonvortex> yeah i've memorized the entirety of the qwerty keyboard
[02:32:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'd be better off with nameless keycaps, since I use different languages anyway. So the keyboard prints are entirely useless.
[02:32:59] <neonvortex> muscle memory is everything
[02:32:59] <MootPoot> like - I dont look at my keyboard when I type but before I start typing I always need to just flick look at it
[02:33:07] <neonvortex> i dont
[02:33:07] <MootPoot> so I know my hands are positioned right

[02:33:33] <neonvortex> thats why those little things on the f and j keys are on ther3
[02:33:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah.
[02:33:43] <neonvortex> so you can center yourself without looking at the keyboard
[02:33:52] <MootPoot> I center myself based on the WASD keys lmao
[02:34:01] <neonvortex> oh so youre a gamer
[02:34:02] <neonvortex> gotcha
[02:34:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That's less reliable as the alignment depends on the specific keyboard model.
[02:34:31] <MootPoot> switching to different keyboards with more spaced out keys royally fucks me over
[02:34:33] <neonvortex> if you're using a typematrix keyboard youre out of luck
[02:34:39] <MootPoot> I need like a whole day to readjust
[02:34:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's practically a 5mm offset between my gaming keyboard and my daily keyboard for aswd.

[02:37:16] <MootPoot> I've decided - never going to use a cloth mousepad
[02:37:19] <ButterNoodle> imagine not having a desk pad
[02:37:23] <MootPoot> I used to use a desk pad
[02:37:29] <MootPoot> but I cant find the one in the perfect size
[02:37:30] <MootPoot> that fit
[02:37:32] <MootPoot> s
[02:37:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Clothe mousepads are a holdover from the need for friction from ballmouses.

[02:38:03] <ButterNoodle> yea
[02:38:04] <MootPoot> so I got a razer overpriced plastic sheet
[02:38:07] <ButterNoodle> just get a desk pad
[02:38:07] <MootPoot> which is AMAZING
[02:38:25] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: yea I'm over 40
[02:38:30] <ButterNoodle> ik what those are
[02:38:33] <MootPoot> I'm 69
[02:38:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For laser mouses, a grainy visual texture of any sort underneath is vastly more important than tactile texture.

[02:41:55] <neonvortex> Head-On, Apply directly to forehead.
[02:41:55] <ButterNoodle> like billboards?
[02:41:56] <neonvortex> Head-On, Apply directly to forehead.
[02:42:05] <neonvortex> ButterNoodle: like anywhere
[02:42:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bus stops used to have them before the pandemic.
[02:42:11] <ButterNoodle> I dont get ads on my pc
[02:42:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I haven't gone outside since so maybe they still have them.
[02:42:16] <neonvortex> online, tv, billboard doesnt matter
[02:42:24] <neonvortex> as long as theyre ads itll be fine
[02:42:34] <neonvortex> like i found this weird head-on one online
[02:42:54] <neonvortex> it just repeats "Head-On, Apply directly to forehead." 3 times and then says "Available at Walgreens."
[02:43:02] <MootPoot> polycarbonate mousepads/deskpads are the the way
[02:43:10] <MootPoot> although harder to get cute anime girl prints on them
[02:43:11] <MootPoot> sadly

[09:26:04] <MootPoot> why do you think I have mania
[09:26:27] <JesseDesu> i'm not a doctor
[09:26:49] <JesseDesu> i have an armchair perspective on it tho
[09:27:09] <JesseDesu> you shouldnt rule it out
[09:27:25] <MootPoot> yes but why
[09:27:28] <JesseDesu> people can be diagnosed as early late as their late 20s
[09:27:34] <MootPoot> does it sound like I'm losing my mind
[09:27:36] <JesseDesu> i've had it i know what it feels like
[09:28:16] <MootPoot> >Mania is a psychological condition that causes a person to experience unreasonable euphoria, very intense moods, hyperactivity, and delusions.
[09:28:21] <MootPoot> I have none of those
[09:28:28] <JesseDesu> what ur describing kinda sounds like a probably case
[09:28:37] <MootPoot> how
[09:29:08] <JesseDesu> keyword is too much energy
[09:29:21] <MootPoot> that's just one of the symptoms
[09:29:29] <MootPoot> hyperactivity is just a thing in itself
[09:29:33] <JesseDesu> are you sleeping less
[09:29:36] <MootPoot> and its not like I'm jumping around all over the place
[09:29:45] <MootPoot> its just I need to expend some energy
[09:29:47] <MootPoot> to think calmly
[09:30:10] <JesseDesu> that sounds odd coming from a diet
[09:30:58] *** Joins: GIR0001 (~GIR@216.131.80.47)
[09:31:12] <JesseDesu> are you stressed out at all
[09:31:40] <MootPoot> well it is keto
[09:31:53] <MootPoot> one of the biggest sideffects of keto is known to be extra energy
[09:32:15] <JesseDesu> is it keeping you up at night
[09:32:27] <MootPoot> no, I can sleep just as much as I could always
[09:32:40] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot: what you are describing could be Bipolar. 
[09:32:45] <JesseDesu> ok
[09:32:54] <MootPoot> I'm 99% sure I'm not bipolar
[09:32:58] <MootPoot> either
[09:33:17] <S_T_A_N> don't rule it out because it's more mild than you expect
[09:33:26] <MootPoot> I dont have massive mood swings, fuck - I dont have <any> mood swings
[09:33:33] <MootPoot> I'm basically the same all day
[09:33:37] <MootPoot> every day
[09:33:45] <JesseDesu> it can creep up on you
[09:33:54] <JesseDesu> thats how it happened to me
[09:34:31] <JesseDesu> anyway, theres a stigma against people with mental illness so i can understand why some people can get defensive over whether or not they have it
[09:34:36] <JesseDesu> so i'm not gonna push it
[09:35:45] <MootPoot> no, I just dont think I have any of them
[09:35:54] <MootPoot> I talked to a psych a year or two ago
[09:36:03] <MootPoot> I'm pretty much the same now as I was then
[09:36:08] <MootPoot> aside from keto
[09:36:15] <JesseDesu> why were you talking to a psych in the first place
[09:36:26] <MootPoot> I thought I had add
[09:36:28] <MootPoot> adhd
[09:36:43] <MootPoot> but it seems like I dont - it was mostly just all related to my diet 
[09:36:47] <MootPoot> which keto fixed
[09:37:32] <S_T_A_N> Or did it
[09:37:46] <JesseDesu> what do YOU think it is
[09:37:50] <JesseDesu> the cause
[09:37:56] <JesseDesu> of too much energy
[09:37:56] <MootPoot> I think its just extra energy
[09:37:59] <MootPoot> lol
[09:38:02] <MootPoot> from a different diet
[09:38:07] <MootPoot> that needs to be expended

[13:08:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but you would still need to learn how to draw
[13:09:03] <mexen> I am actually having a harder time imagining the process
[13:09:20] <DunceCotus> you might be able to visualise a vague anime figure
[13:09:21] <amigojapan> Why DunceCotus 
[13:09:29] <mexen> DunceCotus: at least the fundamentals of it, so you could imagine the images "correctly"
[13:09:33] <DunceCotus> but for it to be represented goodly you'd need to know how it is drawn
[13:09:35] <DunceCotus> proportions etc
[13:09:53] <DunceCotus> unless the software corrects for that but then you're kinda railroaded in what is possible
[13:10:06] <DunceCotus> mexen: yah
[13:10:35] <mixfix41> ive noticing when falling asleep some times are some of the best imagery comes to mind. i cant think like it normally never focus or train myself to.
[13:10:39] <mexen> Or you just imagine a complete panel and resize the boobs in your mind before you send your e-thought to your printer
[13:11:01] <Bco1981> oops
[13:11:25] <mixfix41> so completely dark room might be a clue as to get a visual but a train person wouldnt need to 
[13:12:58] <mixfix41> unless you be the six year old picasso
[13:13:22] <mexen> Then you get audio and video mods
[13:13:34] <mexen> A one man army publishing machine
[13:14:28] <Bco1981> next is voice acting... when i read, i can hear it in my mind in any voice i have heard.
[13:16:34] <amigojapan> mexen: but if everyone was a mangaka it may be hard to find the good manga, like with the app store being saturated
[13:16:55] <Bco1981> and ratings being useless
[13:17:16] <amigojapan> Bco1981: ratings have always been useless
[13:17:22] <Bco1981> i know
[13:17:29] <mexen> Hm... how about chip implants for whatever niche skill you want to thrive in?
[13:17:36] <Bco1981> i don't look at ratings, i look for tags.
[13:18:11] <mexen> Maybe some people can imagine coming and instantly wet their pants. The possibilities are endless. Actually, that last one is already my reality.
[13:18:34] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I look for advice from people with similar taste to me

[22:23:40] <emmeka> MootPoot there are minimum hours worked required since your last claim, or in the last year, before you can claim EI. the number depends on your postal code. you can look it up.
[22:23:56] <emmeka> the more hours you have the longer your claim can last

[22:24:58] <emmeka> apparently they've shortened the hours because of COVID and stuff too
[22:25:02] <emmeka> you should be fine then
[22:25:17] <emmeka> it doesn't have to be the same employer or continuous either
[22:25:45] <MootPoot> napkin math says it should be easily in the 1k hours range
[22:26:07] <MootPoot> not sure what exactly they mean by 'insurable' hours though
[22:26:17] <emmeka> checking quickly they reduced it all to the minimum everywhere, 420 hours
[22:26:21] <emmeka> (blaze it)
[22:26:26] <MootPoot> ayyyyy
[22:26:43] <emmeka> insurable meaning that you paid EI contributions on those wages
[22:26:49] <MootPoot> uh
[22:27:03] <emmeka> ie, you worked a job that deducted EI from your paycheque, or you paid into it yourself as a contractor or self-employed person
[22:27:06] <MootPoot> I think I did - they did make deductions for me ... I think
[22:27:11] <MootPoot> maybe
[22:27:15] <emmeka> just check your paystubs, it'll be there.
[22:27:30] <emmeka> they're required to by law
[22:27:38] <emmeka> unless you're a contractor in which case F
[22:29:21] <MootPoot> seems like there is a EI thing for my current job that I'm leaving now
