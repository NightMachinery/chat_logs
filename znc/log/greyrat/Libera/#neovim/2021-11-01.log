[00:10:57] <mjlbach[m]> great now lunarvim should just work
[00:11:11] <mjlbach[m]> kylo252: I don't think you are "getting" it
[00:11:23] <mjlbach[m]> this is not about setting a server setting
[00:11:34] <mjlbach[m]> this is about us recognizing what encoding the server expects after examining it's initialization options
[00:11:52] <mjlbach[m]> on_init receives the initialization options, and sets an option on the client (offsetEncoding) which we use to form the code ranges
[00:11:53] <kylo252[m]> si

[01:50:59] <phaazon[m]> i.e. for the record, that override layer allows me (or users of poesie.nvim) to provide some code to be able to map back to plugins that don’t support user configuration

Consider lispy and worf which create modes based on the context of the cursor position for lisp structural editing and org mode commands respectively. Hydra and vim-submode let you create new modes any time you find you can prevent redundant keypresses by grouping together related functionality.

[02:17:02] <phaazon[m]> wait
[02:17:06] <phaazon[m]> does it appear fading in?
[02:17:21] <clason[m]> yep
[02:17:36] <clason[m]> (or sliding, depending on your settings)
[02:18:02] <phaazon[m]> it looks pretty cool
[02:18:25] <clason[m]> one of the nice things we can have :)
[02:18:34] <clason[m]> (sunjon does magic in the TUI)
[02:19:04] <phaazon[m]> I’m actually strongly against TUI 😀
[02:19:07] <phaazon[m]> but well, it looks pretty cool
[02:19:15] <phaazon[m]> I’ll use it too
[02:19:38] <Cobra[m]> phaazon[m]: \>:(
[02:20:11] <mjlbach[m]> phaazon[m]: fvim/goneovim are progressing nicely :)

[02:20:20] <phaazon[m]> I saw, yeah
[02:20:39] <phaazon[m]> I played a bit with emacs-29.0.50 lately
[02:20:55] <phaazon[m]> it makes me swallow sadness when switching back to « an old terminal », even kitty / alacritty 😀
[02:21:02] <mjlbach[m]> anything notable?
[02:21:11] <phaazon[m]> the usual speed bump yeah
[02:21:15] <mjlbach[m]> The only headline feature I can think of is pgtk which isn't merged
[02:21:18] <phaazon[m]> I have no idea how they do it but emacs is faster and faster
[02:21:27] <ryanf[m]> Is there any way to run code if and when an LSP client connects for the current buffer? I'd like to do stuff like rebinding `<C-]>` when there's an LSP but keeping the default behavior otherwise
[02:21:43] <phaazon[m]> ryanf: yes, you can use the attach hook 
[02:21:45] <ryanf[m]> `vim.lsp.buf_get_clients` solves the "if" part but not the "when" part
[02:21:48] <ryanf[m]> Oh cool
[02:21:50] <ryanf[m]> I'll check it out, thanks
[02:21:59] <phaazon[m]> I have something like that in my ugly Lua config
[02:22:32] <phaazon[m]> https://github.com/phaazon/config/blob/master/nvim/lua/config/lsp.lua#L43
[02:22:51] <phaazon[m]> https://github.com/phaazon/config/blob/master/nvim/lua/config/lsp.lua#L200-L230 and I call that here
[02:23:07] <phaazon[m]> (here for Rust I add more keybindings, but I’ll probably remove that, it’s not working correctly)
[02:23:09] <ryanf[m]> Beautiful 👌
[02:23:59] <phaazon[m]> https://github.com/phaazon/config/blob/master/nvim/lsp.json#L46
[02:24:05] <phaazon[m]> the keybindings madness in poesie 😀
[02:24:09] <phaazon[m]> I really need to change that lol
[02:24:44] <phaazon[m]> it’s not that bad but I could probably come up with something flatter
[02:24:45] <mjlbach[m]> that's not too bad tbh other than the nesting
[02:24:50] <phaazon[m]> yep
[02:24:55] <mjlbach[m]> which it's json so
[02:25:13] <mjlbach[m]> you could have a nice GUI/interface for setting it so users don't have to directly enter stuff like that
[02:25:19] <phaazon[m]> I like the fact I have several « kind of keybindings »
[02:25:22] <phaazon[m]> `lua`, `cmd`, etc.
[02:25:29] <phaazon[m]> it’s nothing but it changes everything to me 😀

[03:31:36] <mx08> JustinMKeyes[m]: Thanks for your suggestion! But, I guess I want to strip them... (I'm not sure since I'm a beginner)
[03:32:06] <mx08> Well, I'm using (n)vim for some years now, but I don't know any vimscript (or at least barely any).
[03:32:45] <mx08> What I'm trying to do rn is basically `let j = termopen(['echo', 'hello world!'], {'on_stdout': {j,d,e->add(g:out, nvim_replace_termcodes(join(d, ''), 1, 0, 0))}, 'stdout_buffered': 1})`
[03:33:01] <mx08> But this gives me: `']hello world!`
[03:33:05] <mx08> (without the backticks)
[03:35:28] <JustinMKeyes[m]> yeah, we have a util function like striptermcodes somewhere in the codebase, or it's in norcalli's repos, and i'm not sure if we ever exposed it. but we should.
[03:36:24] <JustinMKeyes[m]> or we should just copy https://github.com/chalk/strip-ansi to lua
[03:37:36] <mx08> Well, what I'm REALLY trying to do is write a very small script that lets me open new files via fzf. I know there exist several plugins for that already, but I thought it should be quite easy and wanted to try it myself. I try to avoid having many plugins...
[03:38:50] <JustinMKeyes[m]> all it does is this:   https://github.com/chalk/ansi-regex/blob/main/index.js
[03:40:13] <mx08> That looks actually very simple! Apart from that big-ass regex

[04:39:55] <aphysically> is this naming that's different on 0.6 from 0.5.1 or something?
[04:40:50] <aphysically> even doing "sign define DiagnosticSignError text=P texthl=DiagnosticSignError linehl= numhl=" straight from the docs but changing E->P doesn't change my sign column letters form E to P
[04:42:03] <dumbdemic[m]> Do ":sign list" and check the sign name matches your definition
[04:44:18] <dumbdemic[m]> The syntax I use to change sign is... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/60b1df560e56d0ab1f705d739f39460f7ae40f68)
[04:44:19] <aphysically> oh apparently this is a regression
[04:44:23] <aphysically> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/15684
[04:44:37] <aphysically> but the fix was before 0.5.1 was released but it's not clear if the fix was backported
[04:44:53] <aphysically> and I'm not sure if the fix still allows overriding in the same way the wiki allows, so the wiki may need updated
[04:44:56] <aphysically> reading..
[04:45:23] <aphysically> dumbdemic[m]: you are on nightly?
[04:45:33] <aphysically> maybe the fix just didn't get backported to 0.5.1
[04:45:46] <dumbdemic[m]> yes I build from neovim from source almost daily
[04:45:56] <dumbdemic[m]> s/from//
[04:45:58] <gpanders[m]> physically: what version of Nvim are you using?
[04:46:01] <aphysically> yeah okay, so it's a regression in 0.5.1 and I can't do it there
[04:46:03] <aphysically> I'm on 0.5.1
[04:46:04] <gpanders[m]> 0.5.1 or HEAD/nightly?
[04:46:26] <gpanders[m]> the wiki snippet you mentioned works only on 0.6.0
[04:46:37] <dumbdemic[m]> I use NVIM v0.6.0-dev+531-ge501aac7f, they did change the diagnostic text somewhat recently
[04:46:43] <gpanders[m]> for 0.5.1 you need to use `sign define LspDiagnosticSignError`
[04:46:52] <gpanders[m]> (i.e. just prefix `Lsp` to everything)
[04:47:08] <gpanders[m]> and it might be `Diagnostics` (plural) rather than `Diagnostic` (I don't remember off the top of my head)
[04:47:24] <aphysically> I'll try that too
[04:48:22] <aphysically> LspDiagnostics plural work
[04:48:22] <gpanders[m]> yea it's plural, just double checked
[04:48:26] <aphysically> :D
[04:48:28] <gpanders[m]> so `sign define LspDiagnosticsSignError`

[07:50:27] <_xor> I use multi-mon with several instances of vim. Sometimes I want to open a file in read-only mode that's already open in another instance in read-write mode.
[07:50:57] <_xor> Obviously it warns me and gives me the prompt, but I'm trying to find the config setting to always open it in read-only mode and just give me a status bar warning instead.
[07:51:02] <_xor> Which topic should I :h?
[07:59:20] <b0o> _xor: Not sure if there's a setting for that, but you could write a shell function to invoke vim like `vimnos() { v "+nos e $1" }` where nos stands for noswap
[07:59:50] <b0o> Sorry, it'd be `vimnos() { nvim "+nos e $1" }`, I use v as an alias
[08:01:22] <sudoforge> _xor: i think you may be looking for `nvim -R`
[08:01:59] <b0o> yeah that's better since xor wants it in ro
[08:02:37] <sudoforge> but really, you should explore neovim-remote :)
[08:03:54] <_xor> I'm using it.
[08:04:04] <_xor> I use broot + nvr currently.

[08:12:04] <sudoforge> hadn't heard of it before your message. you may want to take a peek at `lf`, it's snappy and pretty vi-centric by default

[11:03:45] <aphysically> yeah we would need some kind of special editor mode or something
[11:06:53] <aphysically> i.e. we do the former but not the latter of "Code editors and repository frontends should make bidirectional control characters and mixed-script confusable characters perceptible with visual symbols or warnings." which I guess can be an option
[11:06:59] <aphysically> or maybe a plugin :^)

[12:31:37] <nagisa[m]> depending on the terminal you may be able to see these control characters, but ideally nvim did provide a mechanism to specify whether you want to see them rendered as a escape sequence (much like e.g. `<202b>` is) or directly (for bidi users)
[12:32:43] <aphysically> when I tested we can see the bidi control sequences already; the only thing we need a patch or plugin for is a way to visually identify homoglyphs in identifiers
[12:33:04] <aphysically> n.b. homoglyph != "not ascii", there's standardized unicode normalization which would be a start maybe?
[12:33:35] <aphysically> you could be REALLY clever about this and just highlight red all characters that don't normalize to themselves in identifiers via tree-sitter or something
[12:34:09] <nagisa[m]> can you? My terminal happens to show them as a replacement character containing "LR" inside of it, but I imagine that a different terminal emulator could just handle the direction-changing characters altogether?
[12:34:33] <aphysically> oh,  yeah I can see it fine in mine
[12:34:43] * nagisa[m] uploaded an image: (394KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UiqkQZBPgSGmzTWFpDdQEUQp/20211101_11h04m26s_grim.png >
[12:34:45] <aphysically> I just assumed it was on the editor side and not terminal side
[12:34:59] <aphysically> this is me https://i.imgur.com/Vjnp7MR.png
[12:35:02] <nagisa[m]> is kinda what I'm seeing, I would like the `<202b>` treatment for these.

[12:36:04] <aphysically> oh I see you're talking about the homoglyphs now yeah
[12:36:13] <aphysically> yes I would like some option to be able to see them
[12:36:55] <aphysically> note you don't need to highlight all bidi since it's only unterminated ones that can be abused
[12:37:01] *** Quits: rawhawk (~rawhawk@49.205.141.4) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[12:37:11] <aphysically> so you could in principle still support all legitimate bidirectional language use
[12:37:50] <nagisa[m]> as a straightforward solution an option to specify forced codepoint display for specified codepoints would make a ton of sense to me.
[12:37:55] <aphysically> but I suspect that's a mess in vim anyway so I'm more concerned about where we're failing currently (the homoglyphs)
[12:38:02] <nagisa[m]> and is pretty generally applicable too
[12:38:38] <j-k[m]> Is there a nice way to see the error log or just that the LSP is erroring?
[12:38:39] <j-k[m]> Currently I just sit waiting for a bit then if I see nothing I check the log file to debug the reason the LSP fails. E.g. rust-analyzer couldn't compile because it needed `protoc`
[12:38:40] <aphysically> yeah; it's more invasive than ideal though ;( unicode why

[23:35:03] <aphysically> I guess it's easy enough to build a database of all the characters that need highlighted by a plugin but it's going to be very large so I'm not sure the best way to do it performantly

[23:37:25] <xypnox[m]> I am using nvim on macOS and it is `Unix		~/.config/nvim/init.vim (or init.lua)` for me.
[23:38:13] <xypnox[m]> I have the vim configs here as well: https://github.com/xypnox/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/init.vim

[23:38:36] <dundargoc[m]> My bad, thought that was some peasant windows stuff. It's peasant macos stuff
[23:39:00] <maverun[m]> that look nice
[23:39:15] <xypnox[m]> I don't think the location is a problem as other configs that I have done in the file are applied 
[23:39:22] <xypnox[m]> But not this one, just not this one
[23:39:54] <xypnox[m]> Also I apologize for the peasant OS, have to use it for work. I am a linux fan through and through
[23:40:20] <dundargoc[m]> just kidding of course, it's just my half-assed attempt to save face
[23:40:32] <xypnox[m]> XD
[23:40:35] <dundargoc[m]> Hmm yeah that is weird

[23:58:52] <and3rsonAndrewDu> Hi, whenever I call `v:lua.vim.lsp.omnifunc`, a new docstring buffer opens in the bottom of my editor. Any ways to disable it?
