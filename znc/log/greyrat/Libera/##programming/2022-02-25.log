[01:13:02] <KillerWasp> like i'm ask:
[01:13:08] <KillerWasp> how to open a connection without a server?
[01:13:13] <koollman> then describe more. this seems self-contradictory. the remote system you connect to with tcp, is called a server
[01:13:21] <pyzozord> conceptually you cannot not have a server
[01:13:24] <koollman> so ... connect to it, but not. doesn't work
[01:13:28] <GeDaMo> There needs to be a program on the other end to connect to
[01:13:32] <pyzozord> server is simply something that listens to connections and responds
[01:13:41] <KillerWasp> koollman: it's the idea, open a connection without a server.
[01:14:01] <koollman> KillerWasp: what would it mean ? how do you expect it to behave, or what could you do with that ?
[01:14:29] <koollman> the short answer is 'no', but the question is completely absurd, so there's probably something else going on
[01:15:12] *** Joins: duuude (~user@user/duuude)
[01:15:38] <KillerWasp> I am looking to learn how to create connections without the need for the always classic server and client system, which always requires a server with a port listening to the client, which always ends up affected by all kinds of firewalls.
[01:16:19] <KillerWasp> If I can learn to create or do other methods it would be better. Something that doesn't require a server in listening mode.
[01:16:45] <koollman> ok. you probably want to look at the concept of peer to peer server, maybe. some protocols can be used that way. not tcp, though
[01:16:54] <koollman> err, I mean peer to peer system
[01:17:09] <KillerWasp> koollman: It is not absurd, it is possible. is programming.

[01:17:44] <GeDaMo> You'd still need something to be listening on a port even if you don't want to call it a server
[01:17:47] <koollman> KillerWasp: it is, when you're talking of tcp/ip. there's a rather strict model for it
[01:17:50] <pyzozord>  KillerWasp: you can have peer to peer connections
[01:18:06] <pyzozord> KillerWasp: in that situation BOTH sides are servers
[01:18:16] <KillerWasp> Sospecho que tengo que crear un nuevo protocolo para el nivel de la kernel.
[01:18:35] <koollman> KillerWasp: you could find another protocol already existing, just not tcp
[01:19:05] <KillerWasp> pyzozord: el peerxpeer tambien hace lo que digo, es un nuevo protocolo al nivel de la kernel, es un nuevo modulo aparte que necesitas instalar como un nuevo driver.
[01:19:08] <pyzozord> you can't...
[01:19:10] <pyzozord> eh nevermind

[01:20:24] <koollman> although I can guess
[01:20:36] <koollman> pyzozord: not exactly. or at least, it can be symetric in design
[01:20:39] <pyzozord> there is no way around that, it's just common sense

[01:21:43] <pyzozord> btw are "tcp ports" and "tcp sockets" the same thing?
[01:21:48] <juliaEnv> no
[01:22:32] <juliaEnv> pyzozord a TCP/IP socket is a combination of both an IP address and port, for example google.com:80 while a TCP/IP port is only a port, i.e. 80
[01:22:58] <KillerWasp> with a normal tcp/ip connection, i can change the IP or PORT by default during the connection?
[01:23:11] <juliaEnv> no
[01:23:18] <KillerWasp> WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[01:23:37] <KillerWasp> ok, seem like a strange hack
[01:23:47] <KillerWasp> or very insecure
[01:23:51] <juliaEnv> you have to open a new TCP/IP socket (hostname:port)
[01:24:10] <juliaEnv> eventually, close the current TCP/IP socket. 
[01:24:57] <koollman> https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/circuit-relay/ can give you some ideas/insight, but you probably should start with the basics, what is tcp, ip, layers, packets, ports, and so on

[01:26:01] <koollman> can't open a connection to nothing, there need to be something to connect to

[01:26:18] <GeDaMo> There still needs to be a program running on the other end listening on the port
[01:26:19] <koollman> and that thing must be listening for the incoming connection
[01:26:20] <juliaEnv> KillerWasp you can open a tcp/ip connection by creating an instance of socket, i.e. Socket socket = new Socket("google.com", 80); and then connecting it, i.e. socket.connect(); (this is pseudocode)

[01:32:30] <pyzozord> is there even such a thing as "real" tcp or ip connection even

[01:35:12] <deniska> real enough if tcp/ip stacks accept it
[01:35:50] <pyzozord> "accept it"?
[01:35:59] <koollman> KillerWasp: it's hard because you seem to have no idea how tcp works
[01:36:19] <pyzozord> when I close my end the other end immediatly sees "connection closed". Why? or How?
[01:36:22] <deniska> pyzozord: establish and keep track of it as "a connection"
[01:36:53] <pyzozord> deniska: how do they keep track? They'd need to keep sending control packets constantly
[01:36:55] <Decker> it sends a packet with flag FIN

[01:37:08] <ProfSimm> Who remembers this pattern from old PHP code:    $foo = do_thing() or die();
[01:37:09] <Decker> if you pulled the wire and then closed it wouldn't see anything

[01:37:36] <Decker> pyzozord the system handles the garbage collection of the socket... so it ends up sending anyway
[01:37:39] <pyzozord> and the other side will still detect connection closed
[01:37:44] <Decker> even with a -9
[01:37:50] <pyzozord> oh i see
[01:37:50] <ProfSimm> koollman: my condolences
[01:37:58] <deniska> pyzozord: typically OS deals with your tcp connections
[01:38:16] <deniska> PHP? It's a perl pattern :D
[01:38:23] <pyzozord> what happens if the FIN gets lost somehow or never sent because computer powered off?
[01:38:25] <koollman> ProfSimm: it is also a pattern in perl
[01:38:38] <ProfSimm> I think I accidentally reinvented it
[01:38:41] <deniska> pyzozord: at some point the other end will assume that a connection died
[01:38:42] <koollman> although you could croak rather than die :)
[01:38:43] <Decker> pyzozord then the next time the server sends something it won't get accepted, and that wil timeout

[02:04:28] <Decker> it's a lot easier to not commit additional files using something like TortoiseGit which gives you a nice list of files changed and new and a checkbox next to each one

[04:16:17] <AbleBacon> yeah, what amigojapan is saying is the best. those online regex testers. you can put a bunch of strings in there, play around with your expression until it's doing what you want it to do
[04:16:39] <AbleBacon> you can also google examples of simple things and combine them together to get more elaborate behavior
[04:16:54] <AbleBacon> and then save examples of those new things for reference later in the future

[04:17:21] <koollman> well, just write your own regex matcher. a tiny one. then you'll get a good insight on why they can be nice to use and/or awful :)
[04:17:30] <AbleBacon> you just have to think with a mindset of like "what makes this string i'm looking for unique?"
[04:18:23] <AbleBacon> you can also start with multiple regexes, narrowing down the results progressively until you get what you want--and then look at how / if you can combine those into a single expression

[08:11:26] <nitrix> I've never seen any tab-completion do it like that.
[08:11:27] <amigojapan> irccloud, on android, it does not do this when using the screen keyboard, but iam using a real keyboard now
[08:11:49] <amigojapan> maybe I can file a bug report
[08:11:56] <nitrix> I don't understand how the keyboard would make a difference. You press TAB on both to autocomplete?
[08:12:07] <amigojapan> no

[08:12:32] <amigojapan> when using the screen keyboard there is no tab, so a menu comes up with nicks to autocomplete
[08:12:42] <amigojapan> but then you use a keyboard you do use tab
[08:13:26] <nitrix> The approach with keyboard + the tab is broken?
[08:13:36] <amigojapan> ok
[08:13:49] <amigojapan> it may be broken
[08:13:52] <nitrix> I would've expected it to be the other around. Clicking the menu and it places the name without knowing it has to be a prefix or something like that.
[08:14:21] <amigojapan> I thikn few people use actual keyboards on android
[08:14:35] <nitrix> And then you end up manually typing the : or some silly habit you might've picked up. Or IRCCloud is just really really broken.

[10:44:01] <ski> there are tools (like Yacc) called "parser generators" that take a grammar, and produce as output a program that will parse text according to the grammar (and do something with the structure the parsing imposes on the text, typically to create an abstract syntax tree for further processing by a compiler)
[10:45:22] <ski> anyway, the grammar contains descriptions of different kinds of phrases that can occur in the language. e.g. these might be expressions, commands ("statements"), declarations, ..
[10:45:57] <yawkat> the biggest lie we tell compiler language students is that people actually use grammars
[10:47:12] <ski> and, for the parser genertor to construct a program to parse input text according to the grammar, it's useful to know whether any particular kind of phrase (a) could possibly be empty (zero symbols/tokens); and (b) for each phrase, what are the possible symbols which could start it; and (c) what are the possible symbols which could come after it

[21:59:09] <KillerWasp> Before it was easier because each key had a rubber with a conductor in the center which made contact with the copper of the plate. But today most consist of 3 plastic plates, making contact between the two with the pressure of the key. I guess it's considered the cheapest method.
[21:59:09] <gamara> Hey does anyone know what is a better caching strategy prefixing the key with an id associated with an object and storing each property separately. E.g. id1-count -> integer. id1-name -> string,¬† id2-count-> integer,¬† or to just serialize the entire object and just use its id as the key. I am using redis.

[22:58:27] <cockatoodude> I believe there is no reason to drop C. I believe there is reasons to extend C's functionality, that don't involve a total mess of abstraction that doesn't compile to any architecture machine language efficiently and easily to interface with like C

[23:12:40] <oldlaptop> (But that would not be compatible with implementing python in (a subset of) python)
[23:13:15] <cockatoodude> it's not a compiler addition, it's a frontend transition, to convert the code to less abstract useful code for the GCC compiling backends that lead to the object files, that link to or with the libraries and lead to binaries that get optimized then finalized in a native executable architecture and sometimes instruction/instruction set optimized binary
