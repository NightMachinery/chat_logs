[08:37:35] <maxtim> I have vsftp setup with user: `dummy:sftp_users`. when I `put afile.txt` the file saves with permissions 600. i have another user: `maxtim:maxtim`. I'd like user maxtim to have permissions 660 on files saved in the ftp user's directory.

[08:42:59] <maxtim> how should I navigate/search to solve this issue? I've found some stackoverflow responses mostly revolving around www-data user, adding `regular-user` to `www-data` group, which makes sense. But I want to keep the regular user and the dummy user segregated. I would also like to never have to `chmod -R 660 /path/to/files` as that defeats the entire purpose of this project

[08:56:36] <maxtim> This sentence right here: The octal umasks are calculated via the bitwise AND of the unary complement of the argument using bitwise NOT. I would love to understand that fully. 
[08:57:15] <PMT> Which part is unclear?
[08:57:51] <maxtim> 'bitwise', 'unary complement'
[08:58:37] <PMT> Do you know C?

[08:59:05] <PMT> bitwise AND would be a & b. In contrast, logical AND would be a && b.
[08:59:55] <PMT> (I can explain it more if you don't know those operators offhand, to be clear, I just thought it might be faster if you happened to.)
[09:00:23] <maxtim> i understand logical AND
[09:01:45] <PMT> bitwise and, as the name implies, means "for each bit position in the inputs, set that bit to 1 in the output only if both bits are 1 in the input."
[09:03:47] <maxtim> oh i just read the wikipedia page on bitwise operations and i think i'm about to dive into this. thanks for the primer

If you want one user to _have_ different effective permissions than the other, that is in general possible.  Can you explain the goal in term of what each user is supposed to be able to do with the files (create, write existing, read, execute)?

[15:54:15] <PMT> Hm, perhaps someone here will recall the piece of esoterica I'm thinking of. If memory serves, once upon a time, an upstream maintainer put a nasty rant against a specific distro in their software, obfuscated so it wasn't obvious to someone reading the source what it did, and IIRC timegated so it wouldn't trigger until well after the software made it into distros. I had thought that it was this distro, but I

[16:58:46] <ratrace> well on one hand, S in LTS stands for Support, not Stable. but the point of L is that for users to know they can rely on a certain piece of code for L(ong) time. THAT is completely FALSE in Linux. It's a lie worse than cake.

[17:46:59] <ratrace> and unlike gentoo, where you drop a patch into /etc/portage/patches/<category>/<package>/,   maintaining custom debs on debian, built from srcdebs, is a PITA. and I'm even in need of building custom debs and I got bogged down on step 1:  produce a friggin hello world .deb from scratch.
[17:47:42] <ratrace> that's me complaining about severe lack of easy to follow instructions for packaging noobs, facilitated by rather convoluted and complicated tooling :)
[17:47:59] <PMT> Synthesizing debs can be a trial, to be sure, even if you know what you're doing.
