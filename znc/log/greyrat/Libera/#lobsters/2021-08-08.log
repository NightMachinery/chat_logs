[01:28:14] <meff[m]> companion_cube: haha yeah the mop is _okay_, but honestly it's a lot better than not mopping at all
[01:28:55] <bsandro> another arm64 thing I got is mb air m1, that thing is evil
[01:29:47] <bsandro> would be nice to have something similar with even more cores and more memory as a desktop pc
[01:29:53] <mgdm> I saw a thing recently which is a board onto which you put a Pi compute module and it provides NVMe ports among other things
[01:30:19] <mgdm> I am interested in that. Although if you could do NVMe on a Pi400 I would buy that immediately
[01:31:46] <bsandro> https://shop.solid-run.com/product/SRLX216S00D00GE064H08CH/ there are things like that too

[01:42:28] <companion_cube> it should do the basics

[13:07:19] <Guest84> Password managers are great! I'm surprised I spent as long as I did without them.

[13:10:01] <Church> There's a pass clone using that instead of pgp. Hell you can probably just rewrite pass itself and rewrite the few pgp bits

[21:18:47] <river> how would you cat all .txt files into one file?
[21:18:57] <river> I'm thinking find -exec cat basically
[21:19:35] <ngoldbaum> you spread catnip over the files
[21:22:40] <mgdm> find . -name \*.txt -exec cat {} \; > output.txt

[22:38:24] <rhn_mk1> Guest16: what do you mean? graph and network are synonyms
[22:40:01] <Guest16> rhn_mk1 i am looking to build graph to store data & visualize them seeking some suggetions
[22:40:09] <Guest16> tools like graphcommons/cmap
[22:40:42] <Guest16> i think in observablehq  data is separate than visualization, so it may not fit.
[22:41:05] <rhn_mk1> if all you need is a graph, you can use whatever programming language to create one as a list of edges and vertices
[22:41:26] <rhn_mk1> do you need a solution to visualize graphs?

[22:44:17] <Guest16> i want a solution for note taking. i want to put notes directly in graph
[22:46:16] <rhn_mk1> do you mean that you want to put notes on a visualization of a graph?
[22:46:35] <Guest16> i want to store data/information/note in node
[22:46:42] <Guest16> and then link different data
[22:47:01] <Guest16> available on other nodes
[22:47:12] <rhn_mk1> you need to be a bit more precise - a file system is a graph so if you have a lot of .txt files, each file is a node and you have a graph
[22:47:20] <rhn_mk1> but something tells me that's not what you're after
[22:47:59] <Guest16> file system is heirarchial, i am looking for non-heirarchical system
[22:48:08] <rhn_mk1> hyperlinks :)
[22:48:13] <rhn_mk1> .html files
[22:48:31] <rhn_mk1> so do you actually care about visualization?
[22:48:48] <Guest16> yes a lot otherewise i could have used obsidian
[22:49:19] <rhn_mk1> I think d3.js might have graph support

[22:49:49] <epilys> Guest16, look up "zettelkasten"
[22:50:07] <Guest16> i came across gtraphviz but it is not quite user friendly/latest as graphcommons/cmaps
[22:50:49] <Guest16> epilys i think it is a method & all tools are mostly built using those methods, i.e. obsidian/roam
[22:50:59] <rhn_mk1> do you want to build your program, or are you looking for a finished tool?
[22:51:09] <Guest16> finished if possible
[22:51:20] <Guest16> if not available then i can invest some time to build what i need
[22:51:26] <Guest16> but not much as not much knowledge
[22:51:51] <rhn_mk1> ah, okay. I only know libraries, so can't help much
[22:51:53] <epilys> Guest16, I meant look up software using this "method"
[22:52:21] <epilys> you're not exactly being direct with what you want
[22:53:10] <rhn_mk1> if I'm reading the goal right, Guest16 wants a complete program to take notes and hyperlink them with each other
[22:53:24] <Guest16> is it called hyperlink?
[22:53:34] <Guest16> ok, it is a verb
[22:53:53] <rhn_mk1> hyperlink = reference on a computer :)

[22:59:59] <Guest16> is it possible to collapse some nodes?
[23:00:01] <Guest16> or hide?
[23:00:08] <Guest16> kind of collapsible list
[23:00:26] <epilys> Guest16, you can do that stuff in javascript. If you feel comfortable with writing code you can totally write a custom solution for your notes
[23:00:40] <epilys> it's a fun project
[23:00:59] <Guest16> is there anything equivalent in Python?
[23:01:06] <Guest16> as i moved to ANVIL recently
[23:01:13] <epilys> equivalent to what?
[23:01:54] <Guest16> d3.js/or the link which you suggested
[23:02:09] <Guest16> is it called js or d3.js or sqllite or all of them?
[23:02:28] <epilys> d3.js is a javascript library for visualisation
[23:02:40] <epilys> sqlite is a file-based database library
