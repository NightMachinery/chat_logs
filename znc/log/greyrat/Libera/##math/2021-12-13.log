[00:28:55] <int-e> from other columns, without changing the determinant, yes.
[00:29:04] <Z-module> adding any multiple of one row to a different row leaves the det unchanged; so does adding any multiple of one column to a different column.  So yes. Mix and match.
[00:29:16] <Guest78> do elementary row operations preserve the determinant ?
[00:29:24] <Z-module> that one does

[00:30:16] <int-e> Guest78: Err. And swapping changes the sign of the determinant
[00:30:22] <loller_> but I'm also not sure why it doesn't work
[00:30:26] <Z-module> swapping any two distinct rows, or any two distinct columns, negates the det.   Multiplying any single row (or any single column) by constant c introduces a factor of c in the new det.
[00:30:46] <isekaijin> Simplar: Subtract the first row from all the others. This operation does not change the determinant. Then the first row stays (5,7,...,7), and the other rows become (2,0,...,0,-2,0,...,0). Right?

[03:43:50] *** Joins: ChaiTRex (~ChaiTRex@user/chaitrex)
[03:44:17] <Capso> Guest78: plenty of interesting stuff if you intersect them and look at the corresponding ideals...
[03:44:26] <Guest78> have a simple example?
[03:44:32] <Capso> Hilbert nullstellansatz, etc
[03:45:07] <Guest78> ?
[03:45:07] <Guest78> I recall strong/weak nullstellensatz.
[03:45:19] <Guest78> something about the variety of an ideal being the entire field
[03:46:22] <isekaijin> IMO, one thing that is actually fascinating is that the correct way to describe an intersection of two closed subvarieties (of a given ambient variety) is neither [the ideal of the intersection as a set] nor [the sum of the ideals of the subvarieties] is necessarily the correct way to describe the intersection.
[03:46:39] <[itchyjunk]> hmm

[03:55:49] <isekaijin> Guest78: For me, the basic motivation for multiplicities is that we want to be able to “count” the solutions of system of polynomial equations. When the solution sets are finite and discrete, we do not have much trouble defining what “multiplicity” means. But when the solution set contains irreducible components of dimension >= 1, we also want to have a good notion of the multiplicity of the
[03:55:52] <isekaijin> irreducible components.

[06:09:14] <somiaj> arg right
[06:09:28] <[itchyjunk]> 1/(1-z) = sum z^n so 1/(1-z^2) = sum z^2n and so 1/(1-(z/3)^2) = sum (z/3)^2n

[08:54:09] <PlanckWalk> No
[08:54:28] <nagefire> Powers of two are an easy counterexample
[08:54:47] <int-e> not in an interesting way. Of course it'll take n divisions by 2 to reach 1 from any number in (2^(n-1),2^n]
[08:55:13] <int-e> (...at least)
[08:55:17] <nagefire> 8 > 6 but takes fewer iterations to reach 1
[08:55:41] <Quacc> well dang
[08:55:43] <int-e> nagefire: I think we're interpreting the question differently :)
[08:56:04] <nagefire> seems like it
[08:56:14] <PlanckWalk> It is true that for any starting number n, there is a larger starting number that takes more iterations.
[08:56:17] <Quacc> i just want to make sure that starting value and the iteration number are correctly adjusted so they wont reach the 4, 2, 1 loop
[08:56:29] <PlanckWalk> It is NOT true that for any starting number n, all larger starting numbers take more iterations.
[08:56:52] <nagefire> Quacc just use a lookahead
[08:57:01] <int-e> Quacc: since you go from an odd number to a larger number, that larger number will take fewer steps to reach 1 (well, if it ever reaches 1...)
[08:57:26] <PlanckWalk> The numbe of steps required to reach 1 is at least log_2(n)
[08:57:31] <frelleck> is there anything special about the 3 in 3n + 1
[08:57:35] <frelleck> what happens if you do 5n + 1
[08:57:43] <int-e> PlanckWalk: yeah that's what I tried to say, but your version is much cleaner
[08:57:47] <int-e> and clearer
[08:58:09] <Quacc> but will it generally take more?
[08:58:18] <Quacc> as in some giant will number will take more than 7?
[08:58:22] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[08:58:24] <Quacc> or is it compeltley random
[08:58:30] <PlanckWalk> It's not completely random

[09:00:20] <int-e> frelleck: well, quick experiment... there's are several cycles; 1,6,3,16,8,4,2,1 is one of them, 104,52,26,13,66,33,166,83,416,208,104 is another, and I expect there to be more... and there's a good chance (heuristically) that starting at some numbers you won't get a cycle at all.
[09:00:51] <frelleck> heh did you just test that?
[09:01:17] <PlanckWalk> The 3n+2 version is easier to see than 5n+1 ;)
[09:01:27] <PlanckWalk> So yes, the coefficients matter
[09:01:41] <frelleck> some random quote from the internet
[09:01:42] <frelleck> Here is a possible explanation: 3 is the unique factor which, presumably, allows the effects of the 3x+1 steps and the effects of the x/2 steps to compensate statistically. As such, Collatz algorithm is at the boundary of escaping to infinity and of hitting 1 after a (long) while. Hence the excitement and, perhaps, the difficulty...
[09:02:26] <int-e> frelleck: For example, 7 reaches 5928958 in 100 steps, 7014269785336732191339839511433 in 1000 steps, and something about 3.767*10^318 after 10000 steps

[09:04:44] <frelleck> so in the regular collatz, if it fails is it expected that there is a cycle, or that some sequence just goes to infinity?
[09:04:50] <int-e> Heuristically, well, the Collatz map maps odd n to (3n+1)/2 in two steps, and even n to n/2, so assuming that each of these happens equally often we have a downward trend (3/2 * 1/2 < 1), whereas if you replace 3 by 5 you don't (5/2 * 1/2 > 1).

[09:12:34] <frelleck> this is all very confusing

[09:13:16] <PlanckWalk> Not necessarily
[09:13:18] <mycroftiv> relative statements to particular formal systems
[09:13:24] <PlanckWalk> Yep
[09:13:28] <frelleck> so it can be undecidable and proven at the same time?
[09:13:55] <PlanckWalk> Given a formal system (like say ZFC), then it may be undecidable in that system.
[09:14:34] <mycroftiv> frelleck: the idea of Gödel proof is that we can see a statement which is unprovable within that system but we outside the system still regard as true
[09:14:47] <mycroftiv> however not all undecidable statements are of this form

[09:22:57] <frelleck> who knows, probability theory uses cardinalities
[09:23:49] <PlanckWalk> Even some proof in a rather iffy system would be a huge breakthrough.
[09:23:53] <tusko> I feel that I have only scratched the surfaces of probability theory
[09:23:58] <mornfall> (there's a large number of proofs that assume Riemann, for instance)
[09:24:06] <tusko> perhaps i am too much dumb of mathematics now
[09:24:07] <nagefire> tusko we all feel that way

[09:24:22] <mycroftiv> Has anyone who has studied algebraic topology have an opinion on various texts? I'm working with Hatcher primarily right now but Im interested in other potential good sources
[09:25:25] <frelleck> Wait, Collatz has been proven assuming the Riemann Hypothesis?
[09:25:45] <frelleck> or just in general you mean mornfall
[09:25:50] <mornfall> in general
[09:25:54] <frelleck> ok
[09:26:39] <PlanckWalk> A proof relative to RH would be very exctiting

[09:27:36] <nagefire> I would prefer a disproof, personally
[09:28:06] <PlanckWalk> Or a disproof
[09:28:16] <mornfall> like we need more things with huge smallest counterexamples

[09:28:41] <[-_-]> I have a question
[09:29:07] <PlanckWalk> Yeah.  "There exists a counterexample greater than Skewes' Number", if RH is true.
[09:29:35] <frelleck> it would be such a downer if an enormous cycle was just discovered via computer
[09:29:38] <frelleck> and that was the end
[09:29:42] <[-_-]> sorry I forgot

[17:33:14] <river> okay I think I get it, basically I was trying to shortcut including X^2, X^3 etc by just generating the additive group from sums of {1/40}
[17:33:28] <greenbagels> river: isekaijin is objecting to the notation that Z_40 means teh cyclic group of order 40
[17:33:41] <river> but you still actualy generate all sums and products, even if you take the additive group after
[17:34:10] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[17:34:29] <river> appreciated
[17:34:51] <isekaijin> I'm already used to using R_f for R[1/f], and saying that Z_n means something else just breaks the consistency.

[18:03:17] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: why do we need an answer to anything?
[18:03:29] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: Implicit in that question is that we care about groups of arbitrary cardinality, but in practice I only care about groups or modules generated by “relatively few” elements.

[18:04:44] <Z-module> Simplar:  that is, it's when both factors of x^2 - 3x - 4 are positive, or both negative
[18:04:50] <mycroftiv> because the inductive-recursive types and type universes in type theory already correspond to weaker large cardinals, inaccessibles, that do the same thing that grothendieck universes do in categories, more or less

[22:38:05] <isekaijin> No.
[22:38:51] <isekaijin> Also, I am not even sure your rational function should be this one.
[22:40:19] <XCode> isekaijin: the full function is this
[22:41:10] <XCode> isekaijin: f(u,v) = (f_1(u)f_2(w) + f_3(u)f_4(w)) / f_5(u)f_6(w).
[22:41:44] <isekaijin> Where do the f's come from?
[22:42:46] <isekaijin> Is it simply stated that your original rational function f has this form?
[22:42:52] <XCode> isekaijin: I want to show that div_{C_1 x C_2}  = Sigma {x_j} x D_2 + Sigma D_1 \times {y_j} everything would follow if I have div(f + g) = div(f) + div(g).
[22:42:54] <XCode> isekaijin: yes.
[22:43:26] <tusko> sounds like ur gonna need partial derivatives
[22:43:47] <isekaijin> What for?
[22:43:53] <isekaijin> We are doing algebraic geometry.
[22:44:11] <tusko> oh, forgive me. i didnt know with my mere peasants eyes
[22:45:02] <isekaijin> Anyhow, are X, X1 and X2 relevant so far? Or can I just assume that only C1 and C2 mattter?
[22:45:15] <XCode> isekaijin: only C_1 and C_2 matter
[22:46:09] <XCode> isekaijin: so I guess to show that (f_1f_2 + f_3 f_4)/ f_1f_2 is constant on C_1 x C_2 I have to divide by the defining equations of C_1 and C_2 and see if it is constant.
[22:46:14] <XCode> i.e
[22:46:23] <isekaijin> Wait.
[22:46:29] <zacts> hello ##math
[22:46:35] <isekaijin> Sometimes your denominator is f_1 f_2, other times it is f_1 f_2 f_3 f_4.
[22:46:40] <isekaijin> What is going on?
[22:46:41] <isekaijin> zacts: Hello.
[22:47:05] <XCode> isekaijin: let me explain.

[22:49:54] <isekaijin> What is Sigma here?
[22:50:02] <XCode> addition
[22:50:12] <isekaijin> Oh, sum. What does the summation range over?
[22:50:38] <isekaijin> And, while we are at this, what are D_1 and D_2 as well?
[22:50:47] <XCode> sorry wrong notation
[22:50:56] <XCode> div_(f(u,v))_{C_1 x C_2}  = Sigma {x_j} x C_2 + Sigma C_1 \times {y_j}

[22:51:31] <isekaijin> Or a screenshot, if you have a digital document.
[22:51:51] <XCode> I created this problem for a construction I need the construction is complicated.

[22:55:02] <isekaijin> What are m_j and x_j here?
[22:55:18] <isekaijin> Presumably j is the index of the summation, but what is it ranging over?
[22:55:26] <XCode> integers

[22:56:39] <isekaijin> I know what a divisor is. Okay, so your m_j are the coefficients and your x_j are the subvarieties that happen to be either zeros or poles.
[22:57:08] <XCode> isekaijin: yes
[22:57:36] <XCode> I think I got it
[22:58:06] <isekaijin> Wow, so much effort just deciphering notation.

[22:59:27] <XCode> so it ends up being (f_1f_2 + f_3f_4)/f_1f_2f_3f_4 is constant on C_1 x C_2, so if C_1 = V(F_0) and C_2 = V(F_1) we want to have (f_1f_2 + f_3f_4)/f_1f_2f_3f_4 = F_0F_1 + C

[23:00:32] <isekaijin> Completely without warning?
[23:01:04] <XCode> isekaijin: sorry I should have just stick with one notation. It is just to show what I mean irrespective of the problem.
[23:01:05] <XCode> sorry
[23:01:46] <isekaijin> You could have spared me this much effort (and anger!) had you just said “I have a surface S that is the product of two curves C1 and C2, and a rational function f on S of this form: (...) I want to show that div(f) is a linear combination of horizontal copies of C1 and vertical copies of C2. By a horizontal copy of C1 I mean a subvariety of S of the form C1 x P2, where P2 is a point on C2. The
[23:01:48] <isekaijin> meaning of a vertical copy of C2 is analogous.”
[23:02:33] <XCode> isekaijin: yeah. I agree. I should think about formulation before posting it. Sorry.
