[21:17:10] <derelict> hi everyone, is there a configuration variable to display the modeline only for the current selected buffer at a set position rather than displaying multiple modelines for each?
[21:31:39] <bandali> hi derelict, welcome to #emacsconf :) not that i know of
[21:32:01] <bandali> also please note that this channel is mainly about the conference, and you'll probably have better luck asking in #emacs
[21:32:43] <derelict> ah, i assumed that it was about configuration discussion, i should have read the /topic my bad
[21:32:50] <derelict> thanks for yuor repsonse bandali!
[21:33:01] <bandali> derelict, ahaha :) no worries! cheers
[21:35:16] <derelict> :D
