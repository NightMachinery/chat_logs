[14:06:53] <matthewcroughan_> @buZz Well, that's not really what we're talking about
[14:07:11] <matthewcroughan_> We're talking about 33% of nodes reporting the wrong time, which would not require all NTP servers going wrong, it would require only a portion of them.
[14:07:36] <matthewcroughan_> Because imagine that 33% of nodes aren't distributed enough to require a small percentage of the world's timeservers going worng.
[14:07:52] <matthewcroughan_> Time servers are federated, not decentralized really. It's entirely plausible.
[14:08:04] <matthewcroughan_> If email can go wrong (which it has) then time can too!
[14:08:21] <buZz> when has email gone wrong?
[14:08:30] <matthewcroughan_> gmail/microsoft own it.
[14:08:41] <buZz> webmail isnt really email
[14:08:46] <matthewcroughan_> You can run your own mail server, but run the risks of your mail not being delivered to people.

[14:09:30] <matthewcroughan_> Yes.

[14:11:20] <matthewcroughan_> The majority of people use free services that are as you say unreliable. So what are you saying?

[14:12:53] <matthewcroughan_> Time is an interesting thing to include in a lot of software, because often it's unnecessary. Imagine a Bitcoin that did not care about time in the way that it does right now.
[14:13:08] <matthewcroughan_> Time inaccuracy can make the blockchain stop. Why? Doesn't seem necessary to me.
[14:13:17] <Victorsueca> matthewcroughan_: but time can be sourced from a lot of places, and it doesn't even need to be correct, it just needs to be agreed upon
[14:13:21] <matthewcroughan_> Why is time necessary to anything Bitcoin does? It seems like a completely superfluous addition.

[14:16:01] <Victorsueca> matthewcroughan_: you can setup a telescope which tracks the position of a certain planet or star, do some math and that would be a perfectly valid source of time for the next few millenia
[14:16:11] <buZz> GPS time is cool too
[14:16:17] <buZz> and quite widely used
[14:16:34] <matthewcroughan_> Email is a federated protocol. It can be hosted by anyone, anywhere. But the distribution of nodes is now so centralized that it has had an impact upon its usability.

[14:17:50] <buZz> no
[14:17:53] <dodo> no
[14:18:09] <Victorsueca> matthewcroughan_: time is needed to calculate mining difficulty
[14:18:22] <matthewcroughan_> It's interesting that Bitcoin relies on time, is all. To me.
[14:18:36] <matthewcroughan_> It's something that people take for granted, that is never really discussed as a point of interest.
[14:18:48] <matthewcroughan_> It is something that is assumed will always work.
[14:18:49] <dodo> we take the internet for granted too
[14:19:04] <matthewcroughan_> dodo: Not the point. I'm talking about software and the assumptions people make.
[14:19:14] <dodo> you're talking a lot
[14:19:18] <matthewcroughan_> People assume a lot about software. Like determinism. People think certain things are reproducible, but they're not.
[14:19:25] <matthewcroughan_> GCC itself doesn't compile to the same binary every single time.
[14:19:35] <matthewcroughan_> GCC compiling GCC is actually a non deterministic operation, a lot of the time.
[14:19:47] <dodo> you're not more right by adding truisms to your argument
[14:19:57] <matthewcroughan_> Maybe that's because I'm not arguing.
[14:20:11] <matthewcroughan_> Where did you get the impression that I'm arguing?
[14:20:23] <matthewcroughan_> About the email thing, sure, but not this. This I'm just interested in.
[14:20:37] <dodo> interested how?
[14:20:49] <dodo> you make lots of statements, and don't seem to care for answers you get
[14:20:50] <buZz> so, do you realize that time is needed for difficulty calculation?
[14:20:59] <Victorsueca> matthewcroughan_: IIRC developer releases of Bitcoin Core used to be (not sure if it still is) compiled with gitian, which is indeed deterministic
[14:21:02] <matthewcroughan_> dodo: ? I've accepted the answers, and I thank you for them
[14:21:09] <dodo> ok
[14:21:45] <matthewcroughan_> Victorsueca: Did you know that `man` used to print "Gimme gimme gimme" after midnight?
[14:22:15] <matthewcroughan_> If you were running `man` in any sort of CI at midnight, for whatever reason, that's a good example of silly behavior.
[14:22:18] <buZz> its always after midnight
[14:22:27] <matthewcroughan_> I was just wondering whether bitcoin's reliance on time was comparable to that.
[14:22:44] <dodo> it is not
[14:22:44] <matthewcroughan_> Or whether it's really justified, at all. And it turns out that time is a necessary part of bitcoin, which isn't obvious, and thank you for answering.
[14:23:07] <buZz> its just 'man' at 0:30 local time which outputs that to stderr
[14:23:15] <matthewcroughan_> What is required to do it all without time? Or is time a necessary part of any blockchain?
[14:23:18] <buZz> if your compilation depends on a error message from 'man' :D lol
[14:23:28] <buZz> matthewcroughan_: maybe read 11:47:43 < dodo> matthewcroughan_: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty
[14:23:44] <matthewcroughan_> I did. Which is why I'm now asking whether it's actually necessary to use time for this.
[14:23:53] <dodo> matthewcroughan_: you can't possibly have read that page yet
[14:24:12] <matthewcroughan_> Time is external to nodes. Nodes don't create it themselves. I'm asking if they could create it themselves, and have an arbitrary increasing unit that isn't external to the node software.

[14:27:43] <matthewcroughan_> I so far haven't asserted anything, all I've done is ask.
[14:27:54] <buZz> > The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks.
[14:28:11] <matthewcroughan_> So timestamp is relevant only when the difficulty readjustment occurs?
[14:28:24] <buZz> 'only when' , thats all the time
[14:28:38] <matthewcroughan_> I thought it was every 2016 blocks?
[14:28:45] <buZz> do you consider it valueable if any one miner could just mine 2016 blocks while lying about time?
[14:29:15] <buZz> without the time, how would you proof the diff they used to find said blocks would be invalid?
[14:29:46] <buZz> -each- block found is held against the light by -all- nodes
[14:30:11] <buZz> if its invalid (say, the timestamp is wrong for the given diff, or the diff is wrong for given timestamp) , its rejected
[14:31:47] <buZz> otoh, there's nothing stopping you from patching the code to make a incompatible node that -does- accept these wrong timed blocks, you would just fork away
[14:32:42] <buZz> making sense?
[14:35:59] <Victorsueca> matthewcroughan_: the difficulty readjustment happens each 2016 blocks, but before that happens, whenever each block arrives, nodes need to check that it's timestamp is reasonable and sane to prevent miners from tampering the difficulty
[14:37:51] <buZz> i guess if bitcoin was 'airmiles' , time in the chain makes no sense
[14:38:08] <buZz> as in, all coins issued at launch , centralized authority handing them out

[15:32:20] <Victorsueca> lol, he was telling me the same through DM

[15:46:21] <matthewcroughan_> buZz: Cardano uses slots, instead of time.
[15:46:40] <matthewcroughan_> Time is recieved by Bitcoin nodes, by using untrusted ntp code that is external to the nodes.
[15:46:47] <buZz> matthewcroughan_: the slots are time
[15:46:51] <matthewcroughan_> But slots are just an arbitrary increasing integer
[15:47:00] <bairen> so is time
[15:47:03] <matthewcroughan_> slots do not recieve their parameters from external code that has nothing to do with the btcd source code
[15:47:10] <buZz> its 3600 slots per hour
[15:47:13] <matthewcroughan_> I'm not arguing, and I'm not being semantic, I just wish to understand why the choice was made to accept this
[15:47:16] <buZz> its -literally- time
[15:47:16] <buZz> :D
[15:47:24] <matthewcroughan_> Sure. It's time. But the time is gathered PURELY
[15:47:26] <matthewcroughan_> Not impurely
[15:47:50] <bairen> block time doesn't really matter as long as it's higher than the previous block, miners can and do spoof the time all they want
[15:47:52] <matthewcroughan_> Purity/impurity is a concept from reproducibility. Time is impure when you recieve it from an external source, like NTP servers which run code you never made.
[15:48:00] <buZz> i like that they called it 'ouroboros' :D
[15:48:03] <buZz> > ouroboros or uroboros (/ˌjʊərəˈbɒrəs/) is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail
[15:48:09] <matthewcroughan_> So we recieve time in Bitcoin, from external sources.
[15:48:16] <matthewcroughan_> These external sources are not btcd, not code we made.
[15:48:20] <buZz> makes you wonder how much longlivety they consider valuable :D

[15:48:31] <Victorsueca> matthewcroughan_: Bitcoin also has the block height, which I guess would be similar to Cardano's slots, but that doesn't help calculate the difficulty
[15:48:33] <matthewcroughan_> By contrast, slots in other chains is pure time, time that is derived from self.
[15:49:25] <bairen> you can do that in BTC just by spoofing the timestamps, which again miners do regularly
[15:49:40] <matthewcroughan_> Why do they spoof the timestamps?
[15:50:05] <matthewcroughan_> I asked earlier whether timestamps were necessary to a blockchain, and after looking into Cardano I've found that they really aren't.
[15:50:19] <matthewcroughan_> Time from external sources like NTP and untrusted code, is definitely something that hampers Bitcoin.
[15:50:32] <buZz> keep in mind that altcoins are offtopic here
[15:50:34] <matthewcroughan_> There is no doubt about it being unnecessary, it is an architectural flaw. It's not a big one, but it does exist.
[15:50:35] <bairen> extra randomness, if they can find a block with a timestamp +1m from the current time they're not going to wait for someone else to find one first, they'll publish it with a technically incorrect timestamp
[15:50:52] <buZz> matthewcroughan_: 'there is no doubt' ,. please dont project
[15:51:00] <matthewcroughan_> There is no doubt in my mind.
[15:51:03] <bairen> changing the timestamp changes the hash so it's another field they can alter to possibly find a valid block
[15:51:29] <buZz> matthewcroughan_: right, dont project on -me- what i believe
[15:51:37] <matthewcroughan_> I'm not trying to. Try not to think of it like that.
[15:51:44] <bairen> idk what algorithm they use to determine when to start altering the timestamp as opposed to the other fields they can use though
[15:52:05] <bairen> i just know they do it and if you watch mempool.space enough you'll regularly see blocks mined with incorrect timestamps
[15:52:15] <matthewcroughan_> So they use time as a way of gaming it?
[15:52:19] <bairen> yeah
[15:52:27] <matthewcroughan_> I always knew time was evil.
[15:52:36] <matthewcroughan_> Ever since I started using Nix, I've seen time as evil.
[15:52:41] <bairen> cause nodes don't verify the timestamps beyond some basic checks
[15:52:42] <buZz> i dont think altering the timestamp would save you -any- resources over altering the nonce :D
[15:53:02] <buZz> but indeed, blocktime is not NTP
[15:53:18] <bairen> buZz: the problem is a 32-bit nonce doesn't provide enough randomness, other fields need to be changed often
[15:53:27] <matthewcroughan_> Time is a necessary component. But getting time from untrusted NTP code is not needed.
[15:53:37] <matthewcroughan_> Which is why cardano and other things use slots instead.
[15:53:38] <bairen> usually this is the coinbase data but the timestamp is just another field they can tweak
[15:53:51] <buZz> bairen: it doesnt have to, the nonce is -then- hashed
[15:54:05] <buZz> multiple valid nonces exist
[15:54:07] <bairen> sure, but it's still only 32 bits of randomness
[15:54:18] <bairen> there's only 2^32 possible values
[15:54:18] <buZz> plus , you can just swap tx around etc
[15:54:55] <bairen> yeah there are other methods which is why i say idk what triggers them to start messing with the timestamp, i just know it's not entirely uncommon
[15:55:10] <buZz> bairen: so do you think a miner just does 2^32 attempts at finding a block and then gives up? :D
[15:55:46] <bairen> buZz: no...please reread what i'm saying...if they can't find a block purely by altering the nonce they start tweaking other fields
[15:55:53] <Victorsueca> buZz: IIRC with the current difficulty you can usually go through all possible nonces and still have not found a valid block, this has usually been solved by puting some random garbage in the inputs of the generation transaction, but perhaps changing the timestamp instead is a few milliseconds faster?
[15:56:04] <bairen> timestamp is one of them
[15:56:15] <buZz> Victorsueca: hmm, maybe yeah
[15:57:32] <bairen> yeah again idk the exact reasoniing for touching the timestamp as opposed to other fields, especially since the timestamp likely changes on its own before all iterations of the nonce have been tried, but since the timestamp isn't fully verified by nodes or required to be valid, it's another option  they have for a field to alter in their quest to find a valid block
[15:58:01] <bairen> and it's a method i have seen used in the past on main chain
