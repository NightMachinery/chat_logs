[00:09:10] <cthulchu_> hey folks, what is unvalidated data in an HTTP response header?
[00:09:14] <austincheney> sheetjs, I would make the progress bar manually.  You would need to know the size of the total payload and the size of each frame as its written
[00:09:21] <cthulchu_> what do they mean by data validation? Validated by what?
[00:10:09] <austincheney> cthulchu_, a little more background please.  they who?  What causes this to occur?
[00:10:21] <cthulchu_> I'm reading this: https://vulncat.fortify.com/en/detail?id=desc.dataflow.java.header_manipulation#:~:text=dataflow.cfml.header_manipulation-,Including%20unvalidated%20data%20in%20an%20HTTP%20response%20header%20can%20enable,most%20frequently%20an%20HTTP%20request
[00:12:09] <austincheney> cthulchu_, by data validation they mean any untrusted data written to an HTTP header.  Untrusted could refer to any third party code from a browser extension or library on your server

[01:42:06] <samsch> I would like to unkindly remind redux actions to stop existing
[01:42:18] <buu> Basically I have agent.js which fetches a url from the database, creates a browser object, does some setup, and downloads the url, then I have a bunch of files, one per site, that implement a series of functions to handle the specific url
[01:42:56] <buu> But then I also have a set of functions that the site-specific handlers share

[03:43:21] <theskillwithin> I used to work at a hosting company, and a lot of hosting companies use perl still.  so I have deff heard complaints about it
[03:43:24] <ljharb> "can read perl" is a much wider spectrum than most languages
[03:43:36] <ljharb> i'm sure i can read plenty of perl. just not the perl people actually write and run in production.

[04:36:48] <lf94> Oh? What's wrong with that
[04:37:48] <theskillwithin> if thats how your loading bootstrap, its doesn't work like that
[04:37:54] <theskillwithin> it would be something more like this:
[04:38:01] <theskillwithin> import '../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
[04:38:08] <theskillwithin> or really more like this:
[04:38:21] <theskillwithin> import  'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';

[04:40:46] <lf94> theskillwithin: what's the reason for this?
[04:40:54] <lf94> Just the nature of css-loader?
[04:41:14] <lf94> Yeah it worked
[04:41:20] <theskillwithin> what you were trying to do was like a css modules import.  so you imported styles object to use in ur js code.  except your not using it as like that
[04:41:36] <theskillwithin> because its a global stylesheet for bootstrap its just straightup import,  and hopfully the css loader handles it
[04:42:05] <theskillwithin> and because its a node module after you install,  should be able to access it via bootstrap keyword, without relative import

[05:32:20] <Decker> dimi1947 mostly what you get from an import is specified in the `import` statement.  But ya they can still attach things to window. or globalThis.
[05:33:13] <Decker> but generally that's not required.... and they don't really get put into that global context - but rather in the contexts of the other modules that load them
[05:33:33] <dimi1947> if they are attched to window/globathis I suppose that means THE GET TO BE SEEN FROM OTHER LIBS

[05:53:36] <jaawerth> there just isn't a lot it brings to the table where the DOM hasn't more or less caught up. there are a couple extra conveniences here and there but it's pretty use to write (or use/find) micro-libraries that do the same thing with minimal code. and if you need legacy support ,shimming the DOM apis will give you more bang for your buck, IMO, since it opens up more codebases you canuse when
[05:53:38] <jaawerth> necessary

[06:08:08] <ox1eef> in my experience MutationObserver didn't catch every case, and i used a combination of polling & MutationObserver.
[06:08:30] <jaawerth> right, it only catches, well, mutations. CSS animations and stuff wouldn't apply
[06:08:49] <ox1eef> i was only interested in video tags being added
[06:08:53] <theskillwithin> keep in mind MutationObserver reports all the delta's.  so its sometimes not intuitive to use if your not experienced with it
[06:09:16] <jaawerth> I don't think I'e seen MutationObserver miss stuff when it comes to modifying subtrees

[06:09:37] <friend> MutationObserver sounds like just exactly what I need. Is it reasonable to have a mutationObjserver on tons of elements or is there a way to delegate?

[07:22:15] <ox1eef> from the russian perspective, nato is at its borders and it can't tolerate ukraine being in nato or apart from russia as an eu member, thats the grim reality for ukraine - they are a victim of geopolitics, but.. i rather not bother with politics.

[07:23:19] <ljharb> driving your neighbors into your enemy’s arms is a pretty stupid tactic, but Russia has employed it well

[07:25:24] <ox1eef> the next one will be a nato member, so i'm not sure how that would play out. it would be a test of nerves.

[08:59:12] <ljharb> thojanssens: what are you using it for?
[09:00:50] <thojanssens> ljharb, handy to just 'move' an error out of the promise chain. You might have seen code like this before: `setTimeout(() => { throw e; }, 0);`
[09:01:13] <ljharb> sure, that a,ways works everywhere, why fix what isn’t broken
[09:01:18] <ljharb> *always
[09:01:34] <thojanssens> ljharb, it's ugly
[09:01:42] <ljharb> it’s straightforward :-)
[09:01:57] <ljharb> if that’s really the entire point of reportError that seems like a waste of a global
[09:02:01] <thojanssens> it's not, it's using setTimeout with a time of 0. it's hacky
[09:02:21] <ljharb> no it’s not, it’s exactly what the setTimeout spec explicitly is built to allow
[09:02:26] <thojanssens> i like clean/clear code. reportError is cleaner
[09:02:30] <ljharb> you could use rAF or setImmediate too, ofc
[09:03:00] <ljharb> it’s only cleaner if there’s a place to report them to; node doesn’t really have one. uncaughtException is hardly that.
[09:03:34] <ljharb> but i guess, good to know about it
[09:04:01] <thojanssens> ljharb, yeah that's why it's not in NodeJS and it has been a source of confusion for me. Maybe because I intend to run the code in the browser but the test environment is using NodeJS. I dunno. I'm confused:')
[09:04:18] <jaawerth> ljharb: I wouldn't say no to some better error coordination machinery though <3
[09:04:50] <ljharb> thojanssens: best to stick to universal code, ugly or not
[09:04:54] <ljharb> jaawerth: sure, but that's not really this
[09:05:00] <jaawerth> no no I agree
[09:05:17] <ljharb> thojanssens: btw you can omit the 0, `setTimeout(() => { throw e; })`
[09:05:21] <jaawerth> I'm just it's a pain point for sure
[09:05:24] <ljharb> and if throw expressions ever advance, you can even drop the `{ }`

[09:23:55] <Maxdamantus> ljharb: I know. It's just a weird aspect of Rhino. `throw e` will fill in the stack trace for `e` if it's an error object.

[09:28:04] <Maxdamantus> actually, that syntax was wrong, actual syntax was `let(x = 5) x*2`
[09:28:28] <ljharb> jesus
[09:28:34] <jaawerth> lol that's almost a lisp let block
[09:28:34] <trafficjam> for some reason, when i try to switch the 'login' and 'register' action state, it only shows the 'register' content
[09:28:49] *** Quits: zebrag (~chris@user/zebrag) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[09:29:27] <trafficjam> pretty confused as to why i can't change the state
[09:29:45] <ljharb> trafficjam: use codesandbox, random paste sites are awful. first of all, use `useCallback` on `handleOpenModal` and `handleSetAction`. but also, you're actually calling `handleSetAction` as part of passing those props
[09:29:56] <ljharb> trafficjam: you need to make a callback with `useCallback` for *each one* and pass that as the prop
[09:30:26] <ljharb> trafficjam: iow, forgetting about `useCallback` for a moment, `handleSetAction` needs to be `const handleSetAction = (action) => () => { setAction(action); };`
[09:30:37] <ljharb> trafficjam: iow it needs to take an action and return a *function *
[09:30:44] <ljharb> trafficjam: right now it's just calling setAction, twice.
[09:30:50] <jaawerth> that one doesn't seem so bad
[09:30:53] <ljharb> actually `handleOpenModal` has the same problem
[09:31:01] <jaawerth> only track is google analytics
[09:31:04] <ljharb> trafficjam: onClick takes a function, not the return value of a function
[09:31:05] <jaawerth> *tracker
[09:31:21] <ljharb> jaawerth: yeah it's just that all paste sites that aren't editable/saveable/runnable are awful
[09:31:32] <ljharb> jaawerth: i don't actually care about trackers
[09:31:35] <trafficjam> ljharb: originally i was passing the function, but i got an infinite loop error, that's why i switchec to () => {} syntax
[09:32:07] <jaawerth> ljharb: to be fair, that one appears to be both editable and saveble, albeit not runnable
[09:32:11] <ljharb> trafficjam: that doesn't make any sense
[09:32:18] <ljharb> trafficjam: but either way, make a codesandbox and i'll edit it for you

[09:36:14] <jaawerth> repl.it does all the things
[09:36:18] <jaawerth> well, most of the thingss
[09:36:25] <theskillwithin> a lot of them do most of the things
[09:36:38] <jaawerth> ehhhh
[09:36:50] <jaawerth> I mean beyond just js/css
[09:37:03] <theskillwithin> wasn't there some drama around repl?
[09:37:13] <jaawerth> yeah, I think so
[09:37:20] <jaawerth> I don't think they ar to be trusted but I forget why
[09:37:25] <jaawerth> their list of languages is still damn impresive tho
[09:37:35] <theskillwithin> ya
[09:37:41] <jaawerth> and it's nice that you can spin up an actual server
[09:38:02] <ljharb> repl.it is great
[09:38:12] <KevinX> replit accused an ex employee of stealing or something, but I kinda remember them being right

[10:29:16] <nwoob> so there is architectural pattern pub/sub
[10:29:35] <nwoob> what other architectural patterns are there and where can I learn them
[10:29:54] <banana_> design patterns?
[10:30:29] <banana_> sounds pretentious but more your patterns
[10:30:45] <ljharb> jaawerth: only if jellobot is opped, yeah
[10:30:52] <nwoob> architecture pattern banana_
[10:30:59] <nwoob> https://www.redhat.com/architect/pub-sub-pros-and-cons
[10:31:01] <nwoob> like this
[10:31:35] <ljharb> the scalable way to handle it is to bounce unauthed people into a separate channel that doesn't let anyone talk, and has a bot in it that repeatedly tells people to auth
[10:31:45] <ljharb> (and that kicks authed people, i guess)
[10:32:55] <jaawerth> nwoob: there are a *lots* of them. there are whole books about design patterns, but.. if you've just studied up on pubsub, you might want to take a look at the actor model next. it's somewhat related but more generalized, and the two can kinda be used together? since actors are independing and make use of message-passing, they can (but don't hae to be) used in tandem with a message-broker
[10:33:06] <jaawerth> I don't have any immediate links but I'll take a gander at what looks good
[10:33:22] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[10:33:58] <banana_> nwoob: oh ok so those are like scalability understanding and how to scale successfully
[10:34:20] <jaawerth> one interesting thing about the actor model is that it was actually, sort of, the original OOP. Smalltalk as designed by Alan Kay was all about the actor model via objects that did message-passing. It just sorta... evolved (or, as many would say, degraded) into the more java-esque OOP you see more often today
[10:34:24] <banana_> and sometimes custom solutions are appropriate
[10:35:02] <jaawerth> it's also true that one needn't always follow a design pattern though
[10:35:21] <jaawerth> and beng super rigid about it can be harmful. Especially with, say, MVC
[10:35:28] <jaawerth> (which is another one)
[10:35:41] <ljharb> mvc sucks
[10:35:54] <ljharb> in general, "design patterns" are what a language needs when it's not expressive enough
[10:36:03] <ljharb> JS doesn't really need them, but you can use them
[10:36:06] <banana_> jaawerth idk man in javascript I used the builder pattern im pretty sure
[10:36:26] <banana_> it was useful because we have this crazy model we need to support
[10:36:32] <nwoob> ljharb: but pub/sub model is not a design pattern that language need when it's not expressive
[10:36:37] <jaawerth> well I didn't say patterns can't be useful
[10:36:45] <jaawerth> just that religiously followin them can be detrimental
[10:36:47] <ljharb> nwoob: sometimes it is
[10:36:53] <ljharb> but yes, as jaawerth says
[10:37:20] <jaawerth> and some fit better than others. until afew years ago there was a plague of MVC and MVVM everywhere

[10:45:18] <jaawerth> nwoob: anyway, here's a couple quic primers on the actor model - it doesn't always apply in js per se, depends on how you architect things. it's good for doing async stuffs, whether that be just io/messaging/state machines or actual concurrency via workers/threads.  https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/  https://robertodip.com/blog/get-to-know-the-actor-model/

[12:46:14] <bobdobbs> Russia like Chinese money
[12:46:17] <bobdobbs> especially now
[12:47:19] <ox1eef> plus, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[12:47:21] <D4mned> yup they are getting special offers
[12:47:32] <D4mned> from sanctioned countries
[12:48:05] <D4mned> this whole thing is going to back fire soon
[12:48:08] <D4mned> buy some gold !
[12:48:19] <D4mned> lol
[12:48:32] <ox1eef> that won't scale for long, the more sanctioned countries there are the more incentive there is for them to setup rivaling institutions the west cant control
[12:49:03] <D4mned> yeah
[12:49:30] <D4mned> imagine the west and china are two separate factories competing in the same market
[12:49:39] <D4mned> one of them is getting cheaper fuel
[12:50:11] <ox1eef> china is sanction free for now, just tit for tat import taxes on certain goods.
[12:51:23] <jaawerth> it depends how stable that can be. China certainly has the economic might for it, certainly, but they also still do business with the West, and many other sanctioned countries may have certain resources but they aren't all as.. stable? So I don't think it's that easy to predict since *all* these companies (including certain factions in the US and Russia, for that matter) have weirdly
[12:51:25] <jaawerth> intertwining interests
[12:51:33] <jaawerth> tldr globalization is confusing

[12:53:07] <sheetjs> what's the best way to support node and browser streams at once without having to require stream
[12:53:19] <jaawerth> async generators
[12:53:36] <sheetjs> ok lets suppose ES6 grammar is out of the question

[12:54:13] <jaawerth> hmm well... you could still implement an async iterator by hand, it wuld just be more annoying
[12:54:30] <sheetjs> that would be appropriate for an "object-mode" stream
[12:54:32] <jaawerth> that is, IMO, the best native "glue" for such things because it's basically already a stream, just a pull stream
[12:54:43] <jaawerth> yes, for sure
[12:55:08] <sheetjs> but for a regular binary stream, ideally there'd be something using web streams or node streams
[12:55:08] <jaawerth> well for non-object mode you could still do it with chunks/arraybuffers/views
[12:55:17] <blahboybaz> https://onecompiler.com/javascript/3xuza7bra  <--  almost cost me my life.
[12:55:19] <blahboybaz> There were several points where I just wanted to bludgeon myself to death with the laptop
[12:55:22] <jaawerth> I thought you didn't want to actually use/require the thing?
[12:55:43] <sheetjs> the current code is requiring it in node, and in the browser builds it is manually removed
[12:55:48] <dave0> are laptops rugged enough to kill a man?
[12:55:54] <jaawerth> I see
[12:55:59] <blahboybaz> idk but I was about to find out
[12:56:02] <blahboybaz> :p
[12:56:08] <dave0> :-p
[12:56:08] <sheetjs> https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs/blob/master/Makefile#L83 yeah not a great approach
[12:56:11] <jaawerth> well, node does have experimental browser streams that IME work fine. you could just use browser streams on both ends?
[12:56:38] <sheetjs> the process stuff is to satiate webpack 5, which for whatever reason tries to proactively (fail to) shim process
[12:57:07] <sheetjs> or maybe expose a setter
[12:57:31] <sheetjs> that's how FS is supported in ESM right now, there's a `set_fs` function
[12:57:55] <jaawerth> ngl I've kinda lost the thred here
[12:57:58] <jaawerth> *thread
[12:58:20] <sheetjs> https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs/blob/master/bits/97_node.js#L2
[12:58:33] <sheetjs> so the build sequence ensures that the require('stream') part is forcefully removed
[12:59:04] <sheetjs> but this is obviously not an ideal solution.  Ideally there'd be one unified thing that works in browser and in node without having to lean on requiring or importing anything
[13:01:05] <jaawerth> I see
[13:01:50] <sheetjs> the short-term answer could be to do the web stream thing in the ESM build, so at least it would work in Deno
[13:02:00] <jaawerth> I think there's something you can do on that front with package.json and the browser field? well the obvious thing you could do is make a little module that has a browser field thta points to code that just exports the stream globals and the node main field would re-export the node modules
[13:02:08] <jaawerth> stream-ponyfll or w/e
[13:02:16] <sheetjs> webpack 5 irreparably broke the browser field
[13:03:13] <jaawerth> oh, right. well, there is probably a simpler way to do it but given I once again woke up super early today and couldn't get back to sleep I am definitely not going to recall it. however, worst-case scenario you could use something like babel-plugin-module-resolver

[14:16:28] <eXtr3m0> The tab index will define the order and for me it seems tabindex=0 makes it not accessible via TAB. So it seems to be not index based :D:D

[15:37:33] <Cork> friend: setters and getters isn't costly in it self, it depends more on what they do and how
[15:37:55] <Cork> and that only affects when they are called
[15:38:53] <Flonk> ...what? https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/omutiqabep.lua how do I create-react-app?
[15:40:26] <friend> Cork, I am having a hard time justifying being restrictive in what I can accept as an argument...I want to be able to accept "l","left", "xmin" to all do the same thing. how do you handle situations like this.
[15:41:15] <Cork> friend: you mean as value for the setter?

[15:41:53] <friend> Here3's the concept. I have created a dimensions object that simply takes the properties of an element from getboundingClientRect and makes them getters and setters
[15:42:23] <friend> This allows me to align object really easily by stating this.left=that.right to align a left edge with a right edge
[15:42:54] <friend> in the setters, it modifies the position of the element. In the getters, it just returns the position of the element

[15:49:49] <friend> I'm having a hard time making it so you have to use this.left instead of say, this.l or this.xmin which would all do the same thing.
[15:50:24] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[15:50:36] <Cork> they would just add a random value to the object, are you talking about wrantint to freeze the object?
[15:50:38] <friend> but it gets worse. I would love to do dual-coordinate alignment so this.topLeft, this.leftTop, this.tl, this.lt would all be the same thing.
[15:51:16] <friend> as setters, they would modify the left coordinate of the element. As getters, they would return the left coordinate of the element
[15:53:01] <friend> So if I said, this.left=500 it would calculate the distance required to make the left edge =500 and applied that to the element. It works better with this.right or this.center because it calculates the distance from this.center to 500 and adds that to this.x (which is it's left coordinate).
[15:54:06] <friend> So ideally, you could align something to something else by this.bottomCenter=otherthing.topRight
[15:54:39] <Cork> friend: ya? so just create the setters you want
[15:54:48] <Cork> i don't really get what your asking about

[15:55:43] <Cork> also if you want to give multiple values setters isn't normally the best solution (better to have a function in those cases)
