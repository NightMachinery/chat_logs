[06:58:35] <NeoVoid[m]> you cant tell which one has better seeders
[06:59:14] <NeoVoid[m]> torrent dying technology anyway
[06:59:32] <NeoVoid[m]> just my opinion*
[07:00:24] <Zbnssn[m]> how? literally linux isos are shared via torrents
[07:02:34] <NeoVoid[m]> Zbnssn[m]: they need trackers and seeders to be able to leech
[07:03:47] <NeoVoid[m]> after a year or so they a torrent is no longet recieved any seeding potentially rendering it useless and dead.
[07:04:09] <NeoVoid[m]> * after a year or so a torrent no longer recieve any seeding potentially rendering it useless and dead.
[07:11:19] <sla[m]12> <NeoVoid[m]> "torrent dying technology anyway" <- kek
[07:11:43] <sla[m]12> ipfs is the foundation of "web3"
[07:12:56] <sla[m]12> there are more innovation in p2p than you think
[07:19:04] <NeoVoid[m]> i heard about ipfs. 
[07:19:04] <NeoVoid[m]> they are way ahead of time.
[07:19:41] <NeoVoid[m]> its the kind of tech we need.

[08:47:31] <sla[m]12> imo p2p is the future, internet was made to be like that but cause of the nat riddledd ipv4 and lack of tech it was pushed to server client model
[08:48:01] <sla[m]12> now with ipv6 and all, we'll get there, but it'll take some time

[10:54:44] <glizzster[m]> whenever i try to copy and paste other icons in there they just go extremely small
[10:55:41] <gtlsgamr> relejek[m]: what is the naming convention for archived files?
[10:56:03] <AryaK[m]> .tar.gz
[10:56:04] <AryaK[m]> ?
[10:56:43] <smud[m]> relejek: do you use your note taking system also as a todo list?
[10:56:43] <gtlsgamr> no i mean
[10:56:49] <gtlsgamr> YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz?
[10:57:02] <gtlsgamr> or MM_YYYY.tar.gz?
[10:57:17] <gtlsgamr> how does relejek[m] name the quarterly archives? or the monthly archives?
[10:57:49] <smud[m]> It seems odd that there needs to be a mandatory new note every day/week.
[10:57:52] <gtlsgamr> if a single file has a week of notes, does he name it 1_2022.md
[10:58:04] <relejek[m]>     gtlsgamr  i use YYww.md for week file. YYQ.tar.gz for quraterly archive. and YYYY.tar.gz for annuals.
[10:58:16] <gtlsgamr> yep
[10:58:18] <gtlsgamr> got it
[10:58:21] <gtlsgamr> so do you like
[10:58:24] <gtlsgamr> calculate the week>
[10:58:56] <gtlsgamr> I would suggest not .taring the archives. just keep them in directories, so you can later $find them

[10:59:28] <relejek[m]> i see that is an obvious question. i just look into my cal or goolge it.
[10:59:35] <relejek[m]> when i am making a new week.md
[11:00:12] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr: only tar the annuals. not the quarterlies for easy access.
[11:02:35] <relejek[m]> a clear example. i'll add that in the blog later.
[11:02:35] <relejek[m]> weekly file 22w08.md
[11:02:35] <relejek[m]> quarterly folder 22q1 (dir)
[11:02:35] <relejek[m]> annual archive 2022.tar.gz (or zip, no-compress)
[11:10:00] <relejek[m]> smud:  sure, i mean it quite flexible.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/f6c02bb0ad70f29784c37319e6316b93d3633848)
[11:12:26] <relejek[m]> a declaimer though. i am not too dependent on todo list for my productivity, so this works for me. it is like a checklist. if you are a kind of person who prefers to keep an extensive todo list and work with that. it is best to get a proper todo app for faster workflow.
[11:14:38] <klimi[m]> The sad thing is, there is no good todo client for Linux which supports caldav
[11:15:27] <relejek[m]> klimi[m]: use vim or emacs with caldav. good thing you mentioned i was about to suggest that.
[11:18:38] <klimi[m]> relejek[m]: No, vim with caldav is terrible
[11:18:47] <klimi[m]> You don't want to handle all the caldav logic by yourself
[11:25:01] *** Quits: toou (~toou@user/toou) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[11:26:49] <relejek[m]> klimi:  i see. i am not sure how'd that work but i had came across some suggestion for using todo.txt with caldav service. need to look into that.
[11:39:38] <usrbinenvchad[m]> > <@dakship:envs.net> I started with awesome wm
[11:39:38] <usrbinenvchad[m]> > and then moved to dwm
[11:39:38] <usrbinenvchad[m]> I started with awesome wm and hopped couple times to qtile and xmonad but I like awesome and its my wm now
[11:40:00] <usrbinenvchad[m]> whats caldav?
[11:48:13] <klimi[m]> <relejek[m]> "klimi:  i see. i am not sure how..." <- well you mean syncing todo.txt with webdav... that's not really what i want to tdo
[11:48:38] <klimi[m]> <usrbinenvchad[m]> "whats caldav?" <- like... a protocol for creating and editing calendar/todo/journal/adress book things
[12:00:45] <Zbnssn[m]> how's it compared to calcurse?
[12:06:26] <relejek[m]> Zbnssn:  it not exactly an app but a protocol to sync cal/todo/contacts to a remote server and devices.
