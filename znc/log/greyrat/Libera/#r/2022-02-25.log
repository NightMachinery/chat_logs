[15:02:18] <danshearer> hello
[15:03:09] <danshearer> My shiny app partly runs, but then shows me an error I presume comes from GNUPlot: "Must request at least one colour from a hue palette"
[15:13:05] <danshearer> If I omit "colour=pointer" there is no error (and also no plot) so its something to do with the setup.
[15:14:42] <danshearer> (I meant, omit "colour=" altogether)
[15:19:36] <fendur> curious why uyou're using gnuplot with r
[15:22:57] <danshearer> It's a shiny app. I have data in sqlite and would like to make some graphs. What would you recommend?
[15:23:19] <fendur> if you're already using shiny, why not use R to do the plotting?
[15:23:49] <danshearer> I was under the impression that aes was the one true way, but I am very willing to be educated here :-)
[15:24:14] <fendur> aes?
[15:25:19] <danshearer> fendur, as in:   ggplot(data=mydata, aes(x=myXdata, y=timevalues, group=someval, colour=someval ))
[15:25:22] <fendur> im talking base R graphics. plot(), barplot(), hist()
[15:25:43] <fendur> if anything base graphics is the true way, and ggplot is something that sits on top that tries to make it easier to get pretty good plots.
[15:26:05] <fendur> at least that's how I'd tell the story
[15:26:28] <fendur> but with a little practice, you can do amazing things with base r graphics.
[15:26:52] <fendur> but in any case, im more confused now because you mentioend gnuplot
[15:26:53] <danshearer> I have a lot of dimensions to the data, and so far we haven't found a way to get it down to less than a 4D plot. We looked up how to create a 4D-ish plot, and my goodness shiny seems to do it.
[15:27:09] <danshearer> With ggplot.
[15:27:19] <fendur> so by gnuplot, did you mean ggplot?
[15:27:57] <danshearer> So this is the pickle that an infrasrtucture engineer can get into when attempting to summarise complex multiway data sets. My ears are set to "on"
[15:28:09] <danshearer> Yes, I did mean that.
[15:28:47] <fendur> lol ok. if you have a solution in ggplot, then you're doing fine. gnuplot would be a different story.
[15:29:32] <fendur> also i can't help with ggplot because im a Luddite who chooses to stick with the old school.
[15:30:39] <fendur> sorry for the noise :)
[15:32:05] <danshearer> Look I am still learning the lingo. I think I'll get it. A part of me is thinking "Why can't statisticians stick with something really simple like C or assembly language?" but actually, the results I see competent people achieving with R are very impressive.
[15:32:33] <fendur> agree on the latter part. it's too easy to get shit done in R
[15:33:20] <fendur> and while we look like a technical robotic bunch, we really just like to get shit done like the next person
[17:07:23] <Bayes> danshearer I don't blame you, I'm still trying to figure out how to parse a formula call :D
[17:08:04] <Bayes> things like f <- y ~ f(x1) + g(x2) * h(x3)
[17:32:08] <danshearer> Bayes: I see this community is pretty good at helping folk through that stage tho
[17:33:09] <danshearer> I have the challenge of this multi-multidimensional dataset: https://lumosql.org/dist/benchmarks-to-date/all-lumosql-benchmark-data-combined.sqlite

[23:24:26] <rickyrick> Such is life in the zone
[23:30:21] <Bayes> heh
[23:30:48] <Bayes> is that a temporary thing just cause it's a busy part of the year in your field, or more like a normal thing?
[23:31:03] <rickyrick> Got lazy and let backlog build up :^)
[23:35:46] <Bayes> laziness comes back to bite you in the ass
[23:37:50] <rickyrick> As it always does
[23:38:35] * Bayes always gets tripped on (semi) positive definiteness
[23:38:57] <Bayes> some people talk about positive definiteness, other about (semi) positive definiteness
[23:39:12] <Bayes> without being very explicit about what they mean with the parentheses
[23:39:36] <rickyrick> Usually that means the case of interest is positive definite, but semi can also happen
[23:40:10] <DrNostril> hidey ho Bayes
[23:52:01] <Bayes> rickyrick oh, the case of interest
[23:52:05] <Bayes> I haven't thought about that
[23:53:00] <Bayes> unless it's a highly theoretical paper, they'll just say the matrix is (semi) positive definite and assume that it's nice enough to carry on
[23:53:07] <rickyrick> Yeah just like how multivariate normal covariance can be singular
[23:53:12] <rickyrick> but it's not really of interest most of the time
[23:53:53] <Bayes> and like you can have a Normal(mu, 0), which is degenerate but who care about that distribution
[23:54:08] <Bayes> hey DrNostril
[23:55:17] <rickyrick> Yep
