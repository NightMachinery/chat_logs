[16:19:53] <canton7> luetm, so, just inject `Func<ViewModel>` if you don't need to specify any ctor parameters explicitly, otherwise you're into defining your own factories
[16:20:08] <canton7> StyletIoC doesn't provide much wizardry for generating factories for you; other ioc contains do
[16:20:26] <canton7> (i.e. in Autofac I think you can inject a `Func<SomeDependency, ViewModel>` if you VM's ctor takes a `SomeDependency`

[21:00:52] <bomb> right

[21:43:22] <khanred> Careful, he might explode
[21:43:29] <redoc> he WILL explode
[21:43:37] <khanred> probably earlier than expected
[21:43:53] <redoc> thats never good
[21:44:00] <khanred> no, it isn't
[21:48:45] <MatthiasVance> bomb: In some big companies it's very easy, because you only get promoted if you have undertaken a complex project :P So the incentive is .. create complex projects!
[21:49:22] <bomb> MatthiasVance just for the sake of it :(
[21:53:10] <ern> jamea: Some printers can actually render PDF directly.
[21:53:22] <ern> I have done that (sent PDF directly to the printer port)
[21:54:50] <MatthiasVance> If I want to dive into the PDF standard, what's most interesting to do?
[21:54:58] <MatthiasVance> HTML -> PDF?
[21:55:11] <MatthiasVance> I only see paid stuff for that
[21:56:33] <ern> What do you want to do?
[21:56:42] <bomb> I'd say, database -> PDF report maker
[21:56:42] <ern> ghostscript can do alot of this.
[21:56:46] <gufi> grrrr...  FirstOrDefaultAsync throws exceptions in unit tests but is fine at runtime in the application ( mocked shit in tests uuuugh )
[21:57:00] <bomb> database or SCSS or Excel, whatevs
[21:57:11] <MatthiasVance> That sounds more like reporting bomb?
[21:57:33] <MatthiasVance> So if you could write a Razor view for it, you could then use X to make it a PDF
[21:57:46] <bomb> yeah, what else to do with PDF?
[21:58:09] <bomb> isn't Razor rendered on HTML Canvas?
[21:58:19] <bomb> then conversion would be a little easier
[21:59:14] <MatthiasVance> bomb: Ahh since you mentioned DB but there has to be some intermediary format
[21:59:32] <MatthiasVance> I was just wondering if there are more interesting use cases than HTML -> PDF
[21:59:54] <bomb> oh hmm if you're after interesting instead of money
[22:00:01] <MatthiasVance> Well not necessarily ;p
[22:00:03] <bomb> PDF has 3D support
[22:00:15] <MatthiasVance> PDF also has scripting support! (lol)
[22:00:53] <MatthiasVance> ern: Is that a managed thing?
[22:00:55] <bomb> well, it IS scripting XD
[22:02:25] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[22:02:50] <bomb> how to fork child workers and then kill them?
[22:12:20] <JakeSays> LOL i've made $30 on my shiba inu investment
[22:12:53] <JakeSays> ern: ghostscript is a terrible tool to make pdfs with

[22:16:09] <ern> I can has shiba
[22:16:12] <JakeSays> ern: it doesn't do it at all. ghostscript is for rendering postscript
[22:16:31] <blez`> JakeSays there is a fast food thing near my place, while waiting for my burger yesterday they talked how they made ~$30 from shiba

[22:30:09] <Bradley32110> he gave me 1 week deadline

[22:30:39] <JakeSays> Bradley32110: move UserContextCode out of the repo. commit. move UserContextCode back in, and rename to StupidBossCode. commit. done.
[22:30:50] <Bradley32110> ha!
