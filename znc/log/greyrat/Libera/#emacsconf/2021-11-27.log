[16:51:50] <JooPedrodeAmorim> why is it that emacsconf uses pre-recorded talks? logistics?
[16:52:51] <publicvoit> This time, I tested a new approach to minimize my recording effort (which is not well-trained): splitting up my talk into small scenes and re-recording only the few that turned out badly. I had to improve my knowledge on how to edit videos.
[16:52:54] <thecatster_> codingquark: I actually did end up doing this multiple times 😆
[16:53:30] <codingquark> :D
[16:53:44] <publicvoit> JooPedrodeAmorim: online conferences without pre-recorded videos do face technical issues which may annoy the viewers and maximizes hand-over time.

[16:57:56] <JooPedrodeAmorim> <publicvoit> "This time, I tested a new..." <- and how did that work? are you happy with the final result? do you think it looks "choppy"?
[16:58:21] <bandali> yeah there are a few motivations for using prerecordings: 1. less room for technical issues 2. less stress for everyone :) 3. we can make videos available pretty much instantaneously as each talk goes live
[16:58:25] <bandali> JooPedrodeAmorim, ^
[16:58:53] <publicvoit> JooPedrodeAmorim: I'm quite content, yes. But I'm new to video editing so my level of expectation from me is quite low.
[16:58:59] <JooPedrodeAmorim> <publicvoit> "João Pedro de Amorim Paula..." <- i pictured that would be a reason. i'm not against it, i find it allows the presenters to prepare much more well-rounded presentations, even allowing for some editing magic
[16:59:28] <publicvoit> JooPedrodeAmorim: it also allows for captions for handicapped people.
[16:59:53] <JooPedrodeAmorim> also allows for captioning which is amazing for non-native English speakers

[19:14:36] <Cairn> Streaming in vlc/mpv can sometimes just be "too far ahead" compared to your internet connection. You can fix it by pausing for a few seconds so there's more buffer time.

[19:32:54] <blackbeard> I don't think I could teach Emacs to my neighborhood 
[19:33:00] <greta> @msk <3
[19:33:15] <binarydigitz01> tbh I don't even know anyone who uses linux irl, much less emacs

[19:33:16] <corwin> So, we never look in our neighbor's Emacs conf unless it is to see if they have enough features.
[19:33:18] <greta> blackbeard Just beginning with one at a time... (LOL - ?!)

[19:33:30] <blackbeard> The other day I was thinking how there are so many 'Emacs needs to be more noob friendly' articles all over
[19:33:35] <greta> zshbunni I am addicted to the free core of Emacs...
[19:33:35] *** Quits: Aryak (~Aryak@front0.emacsconf.org) (Client Quit)
[19:33:37] <NullNix> I'd teach emacs to my neighbourhood, but in cambridge there's no point, they all use it anyway
[19:33:46] <esrh> lol
[19:33:48] <zshbunni> greta noice
[19:33:49] <shoshin> a friend of mine (my original emacs mentor) has been telling me about Ivan Ilich and wondering about how his philosophy lines up with free software
[19:33:55] <blackbeard> But I would argue that won't get as many users as translating Emacs

[19:34:17] <greta> shoshin When I read Illich, I see free software...
[19:34:20] <shoshin> so this is amazing synchronicity of thought for me.
[19:34:30] <zshbunni> in the 480p link, there's no audio :(
[19:34:30] <blackbeard> Emacs won't have as many users as other programs because of the language, not the key bindings
[19:34:34] <cmack> Agreed. This is saying out loud in concrete language everything I've felt about emacs and the community since e.g. the package system became available and social git forges made it easy to explore others' configs 
[19:34:37] <noorul> cognitive democracy
[19:34:39] <sachac> shoshin: That's why we put the philosophy talks together =)
[19:34:46] <shoshin> greta: thats great! i will need to spend some time reading 
[19:34:49] <corwin> cognititve democray is a very useful phrase to describe emacs (and FOSS) culture

[20:46:37] <Noisytoot> N-Angulator, GPLv3 just doesn't allow tivoization or DRM, SaaS is allowed, and if you're the only copyright holder you don't need to license to yourself anyway.

[21:45:16] <JooPedrodeAmorim> it is helpful to quote functions with `#'` also because Emacs Lisp is a Lisp-2, which means that a same symbol can refer to a variable or a function, so `#'` helps it distinguish and tells you and the reader that the symbol being quoted refers to a function

[21:47:57] <sachac> This talk was supposed to be followed by a talk on how you can help Emacs maintainers, but unfortunately, that didn't come together in time for the conference.
[21:48:03] <Arya[m]> gtg now

[21:48:13] <kimjetwav> Bye!
[21:48:16] <publicvoit> Wow, I think you are going to have to know a LOT on Emacs development, versions, Elisp details, ... to do that kind of work.
[21:48:17] <Cairn> gi-yt: See ya
[21:48:33] <JooPedrodeAmorim> abhiseck: sometimes you just want to mindlessly improve code :P
[21:48:33] <Cairn> sachac: Do you think that talk will shared at some point later?
[21:48:34] <sachac> but maybe johnw can mention some things us normal folks can do to help out? =)
[21:48:36] <johnw> publicvoit: One very helpful thing anyone can do is just confirm bug reports and add reproduction steps if they are missing.

[21:50:07] <protesilaos> geneg1: yes
[21:50:09] <ieure> geneg1, Yes.  `pacakge-foo` is public, `package--foo` is internal.
[21:50:11] <NullNix> mindless tree-wide transforms like this are what coccinelle is for. why are emacs maintainers still doing this by hand? you'd think lisp would be well-suited for expressing semantic patches to lisp... :/

[21:51:07] <protesilaos> abhiseck: hello there!
[21:51:18] <alphapapa[m]> protesilaos: Hi Prot :)
[21:51:23] <publicvoit> OK, this blows my mind in a sense that I realize that I really don't have an idea of coding Elisp.
[21:51:25] <sachac> NullNix: that sounds like it would be nice. =) Please be sure to reach out to the speaker!
[21:51:29] <Achylles> :)
[21:51:41] <NullNix> no, but the *idea* should work there, and Lisp is so regular in structure that something like coccinelle is the sort of thing lisp boosters say is really easy in lisp. but nooo, none exists that I know of :(
[21:51:48] <NullNix> (coccinelle itself is written in ocaml :) )
[21:51:49] <geneg1> I notice that some packages use ~ and some use double-dash to represent internal funcs. Is one more canonical than the other? 
[21:51:50] <abhiseck> protesilaos: Nice to see you here. I missed your talk. Have to see the recording. 
[21:51:56] <alphapapa[m]> protesilaos: Going to have to go back and rewatch your talk from earlier, I wasn't able to give it my full attention when it was live.  Seemed great.  :)
[21:51:58] <protesilaos> alphapapa[m]: hi 👋
[21:51:59] * NullNix is just grumping really
[21:52:22] <cnngimenez`> Question: Is there a place where these coventions and compilers checks are listed? A web page, an info perhaps? 
[21:52:26] <tgbugs> NullNix: the risk of false positives for certain types of transformations is also an issue
[21:52:35] <alphapapa[m]> NullNix: There are some Elisp search/replace/transformation packages in ELPA and MELPA

[21:52:48] <ieure> NullNix, The problem with the regular syntax is that everything is just a list of lists of syms, which I expect makes it more difficult to programmatically infer semantics than a more syntaxy language like C.
[21:52:53] <codingquark> Oh man, most of the time I feel too lazy to get rid of these defvar complaints myself for my own code
[21:52:53] <NullNix> tgbugs: that's why you read the diffs afterwards (which is much faster than doing the changes yourself).

[23:00:08] <malaclyps> the best thing about Iosevka is that it's compiled from a shape definition language that's a lisplike
[23:00:14] <jan-ypma> The font is actually "New heterodox mono", here https://github.com/hckiang/font-new-heterodox-mono/
[23:00:14] <pbeadling> For the CPD thing the biggest limitation I think is that you have to have the org file in the current buffer to add items - really you want to be able to capture CPD items from anywhere in your workflow - when I get some time I'll update the script to integrate better with capture and agenda like this.

[23:02:23] <lounge-780> The serif font is because of mixed-pitch. 
[23:02:25] <shrysr> shoshin: i think. it is the sans serif font (?) within the org babel code blocks
[23:02:34] <danielsousaio[m4> I use restclient everyday, but never thought about using it from code blocks, duh! Very interesting talk!
[23:02:54] <malaclyps> shoshin, it says that it supports Lakota: https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka
[23:03:01] <ieure> This is a good demo, I've found org-babel to be a really amazing glue language for stuff that's sort of annoying to automate otherwise.
[23:03:20] <jan-ypma> Thanks! :) So the fonts of the current talk are:
[23:03:20] <jan-ypma> Fixed pitch (serif): New Heterodox Mono
[23:03:20] <jan-ypma> Variable pitch (serif): ETBembo
[23:03:39] <shoshin> danielsousaio[m4: it may be dealt with in this talk, but i had to use some other language running a session in the background to store responses, tokens etc. but it does work!

[23:24:24] <kimjetwav> I gotta say, why "Orgdown" and not just "Org"? That way we've got "Org" (the markup syntax) and "Org-Mode", the mode for that. Just delineate the mode from the thing the mode handles.

[23:25:07] <lounge-210> New people might not be into emacs but they can easily see the value of org
[23:25:11] <lounge-496> kimjetwav : there was a move in the opposite direction, using "Org" instead of "Org-mode" for the piece of software that runs inside Emacs, which to me is where the problem arises...

[23:48:51] <lounge-073> you can choose the best choice for you . but if you want to use projects which the code is in gh or gl. you need to find a way to run it without mixing your own base setup. 
[23:48:51] <lounge-073> it sucks but it is the only way if you want to use those foss software/apps.
[23:48:53] <danielGerman> check the github repo. it has all the code
[23:49:02] <Noisytoot> danielGerman, Why GitHub? GitHub is nonfree.

[23:49:12] <shrysr> yea, danielGerman the xournal annotation was cool :)
