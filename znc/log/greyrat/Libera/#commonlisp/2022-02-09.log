[05:21:35] <kathe> okay. thanks.
[05:22:10] <Guest74> cl is a pretty small community with lots of old packages, so I don't see search engines giving it much love.
[05:22:31] <kathe> yes. agree with that.
[05:22:54] <kathe> have you seen beach's second-climacs?
[05:23:01] <kathe> he's done an impressive job.
[05:23:26] <kathe> though, it's not all that ready for primetime. might need dog-fooding.
[05:24:02] <kathe> i think it's quite an amazing effort.

[05:27:52] <kathe> the realisation though scary initially has strengthened my resolve to work through the whole portion thoroughly.
[05:28:10] <kathe> this time i'll be a better developer than the last time.
[05:28:10] <Guest74> most of my unfinished stuff isn't published as it's still in flux. lots more than one repository as well.  Desktop software isn't small.

[05:29:21] <Guest74> yeah, I kind of like to have control over everything.

[05:30:01] <kathe> yeah, and i like the you're a control freak. even i was the last time i developed software.

[05:43:52] <Guest74> the downside to writing desktop stuff is making stupid changes to your running system.  Just made a new bug in my workspace handling and stuff disappeared.
[05:44:32] <kathe> your data!
[05:46:35] <kathe> btw, what "kind" of applications are you developing in common-lisp?
[05:47:04] <kathe> yes, i understood that they are desktop related, but for which type of work?
[05:47:25] <kathe> or are they for leisure activities like games or music/video?
[05:49:09] <Guest74> window manager to start.
[05:49:26] <kathe> i just realised that if i don't go the scheme way (sicp, eopl, lisp) i can shave-off 2 years from my study schedule.
[05:49:53] <Guest74> changing that right now to work with the same UI stuff as the rest of the system, and make it work on console as well.
[05:49:54] <kathe> i'm not all that strong on parsers, interpreters, compilers.
[05:50:31] <kathe> Guest74: you're developing a window manager in common-lisp! awesome.

[05:52:13] <Guest74> It's one of the reasons I added some of th emissing extensions to CLX.
[05:52:15] <kathe> what can "structure and implementation of computer programs", "essentials of programming languages" and "lisp in small pieces" teach me that would be useful while working on beach's "second-climacs" code-editor?
[05:52:35] <kathe> i do intend to meticulously work through 'paip' though.
[05:52:50] <kathe> i just don't want to deviate into "scheme" land unnecessarily.
[05:52:58] <Guest74> It's more repl controlled right now.  my goal is to not have to interact with it and it just do what I want.
[05:53:02] <kathe> also would like to save 2+ years of study time.
[05:53:46] <kathe> Guest74: any way to track your progress? other than on here?
[05:53:50] <Guest74> You have to ask others about those books.  Beach's projects seem to be laid out very logically.
[05:55:12] <kathe> yes. i'm in awe of beach's disciplined approach. also he's very meticulous.
[05:55:45] <Guest74> nope.  I'm trying to tighten up some libraries so I can at least release an alpha of the basic window manager.
[05:56:04] <Bike> SICP and so on are good books that should improve your programming generally. they're not directly related to editors any more than PAIP is. course that doesn't mean you have to read them if you don't want to.
[05:56:13] <Guest74> I'm sure it'll still change after I get it running on the console.
[05:56:57] <kathe> which areas of computer science be used in producing syntax-colouring and other code-editing tasks?
[05:57:25] <kathe> not that it's all i'm going to work on, but that's what i want to beign with.
[05:57:44] <kathe> and if 'sicp' and associated books need not be worked through, i might as well not.
[05:57:46] <White_Flame> not really CS, but error-aware lexing/parsing and ASTs
[05:58:30] <kathe> White_Flame: so i guess compiler related stuff?
[05:58:36] <White_Flame> sure
[05:58:47] <White_Flame> and of course whatever it takes to interface with the editor of choice
[05:59:40] <kathe> White_Flame: any books/material you could suggest to understand lexers, parsers and 'ast' using common-lisp?
[06:00:10] <White_Flame> I'm not familiar with compiler-in-lisp books
[06:00:21] <kathe> i remember one of the lisp hackers at "cleartrip" talking about some great book on 'ast' using common-lisp, can't remember the title.
[06:00:52] <White_Flame> but I guess the reader would also need to change, unless you want to die on the first unreadable form and lose the ability to display any errors further into the buffer
[06:01:36] <kathe> hmnn, the best books on compiler-using-lisp are 'sicp', 'eopl' and 'lisp'. :(
[06:01:50] <kathe> darn, i think it's best that i work through them.

[06:01:56] <Bike> yeah, eclector has a lot of hardening where you can make it keep reading through errors.
[06:01:58] <kathe> would be good to have a strong background.
[06:02:31] <White_Flame> or you just do it or read what goes on in slime
[06:02:41] <White_Flame> it's a generally bounded set of problems
[06:02:56] <Bike> i don't know if you need to learn lexing/parsing/AST production for beach's editor. those parts are already done in the main
[06:03:07] <White_Flame> though all kind of weird and subjective as to what it "should" do
[06:03:11] <Bike> i mean, might be good to know anyway.
[06:03:21] <kathe> i guess there's wisdom in being patient. will work through those scheme books.

[15:40:41] <jackdaniel> having an editor in the image is a double-edged sword - you may crash your whole ide while testing the application ;)

[15:47:43] <lisp123w> Granted, I'm restarting because I'm modifying the editor itself and I'm stuck and can no longer type keys, but the level of crashing in LW far exceeds that of Emacs because everythng is in the same image

[15:59:03] <ecraven> they should really create a gaming library in CL, just to confuse things further :P
[16:00:31] <rotateq> ecraven: and ACL2 means the functional subdialect, also usable as a prove system

[16:06:20] * pl used to have ACL Enterprise time-limited license
[16:06:51] <ecraven> is ACL much better than SBCL?
[16:06:53] <pl> ACL2 is a separate project IIRC
[16:07:00] <pl> ecraven: depends on what you need to do
[16:07:32] <pl> I believe SBCL generates faster code, but there's all kinds of stuff *other than compiler* involved with commercial lisps
[16:09:11] <rotateq> yes many things on top i would say
[16:09:28] <pl> I don't remember specific language-implementation side benefits in Allegro, but I think it might have better GC (and of course better support for Windows)
[16:10:23] <pl> From my personal PoV LW is more interesting (among other things, embeddable like ECL, and its GUI library is cross-platform unlike Allegro's CG)
[16:11:17] <pl> LW's CAPI has Win32, Cocoa, GTK+ and Motif backends. Allegro's CG has Win32 and GTK+, and that's lead to pain if you have to deal with macs
[16:12:08] <pl> (on top of all other pain Macs bring ;V)
[16:12:50] <pl> I had temporary license because I tried to push a student project into using AllegroGraph, and the best integration is with ACL running in "modern" mode, iirc

[16:17:29] <lisp123w> Yeah it seems LW's strongpoint is portablity and ACL is around AllegroCache / AllegroGraph / other data stuff

[16:23:07] <lisp123w> I think its worthwhile for everyone to try multiple lisp implementations and not just restrict to SBCL
[16:23:30] <lisp123w> e.g. CLISP / CCL / ABCL / ECL / others -> a lot can be learned from doing things slightly differently
[16:23:40] <rotateq> of course

[22:17:09] <AeroNotix> Looking for opinions: https://github.com/cffi/cffi/blob/master/src/cffi-sbcl.lisp#L158-L162 IMHO, this form should bind the pointer to a var before passing expanding the body, then free that pointer instead of the user var pointer
[22:17:43] <AeroNotix> this way... the user's code could do pointer maths on the pointer, the way it is right now if you do e.g. cffi:incf-pointer in with-foreign-pointer it will raise a segv

[23:23:36] <foxfromabyss> I am using https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-dbi to interface with sqlite
[23:23:36] <foxfromabyss> after `SELECT` I *think* i get a plist, `(time 2022-02-09T19:33:34.108813+00:00)`, where `time` is a keyword (that's what `type-of` told me), but I can't figure out how to access that specific parameter
[23:23:48] *** Joins: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247)
[23:23:51] <foxfromabyss> i am outputting the row with `format t "~A~%" row` if that helps
[23:25:17] <White_Flame> ~s gives more specifics than ~a, and if you just let the return value print on the repl, you'll see it's :TIME, not TIME.  ~a will elide the package
[23:25:30] <White_Flame> so (getf retval :time)
[23:26:01] <foxfromabyss> oh, it actually returns `:|time|` as key, that solves it

[23:26:03] <foxfromabyss> thanks a lot!
[23:26:08] <White_Flame> ah, even worse :)
[23:26:44] <White_Flame> wow, yeah, ~a is pretty bad there
