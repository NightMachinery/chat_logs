I agree with your analysis, though I'd add that even CNN's design is less than ideal (too cluttered, win indicator less than obvious), and it's not clear to me why they can't display "yes" and "no" on the same line (given that they must add up to the whole line), so no one really aces this, but the NYT certainly fails it very hard
[02:29:29] <quanticle> Yeah, what's worse is that the version of the infobox that the New York Times has on their main story for the event doesn't even include the graphs! It's just the highlight-that-looks-like-a-graph-but-really-isn't

[02:58:42] <Obormot\Gaia> A bunch of garlic, red onion, pickled red onion, red pepper, oregano, parsley flakes, salt, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, an actual fresh tomato, a jar of roasted red pepper + sun-dried tomato spread, Worcestershire sauce, vodka, milk

[04:15:16] <|dbotdan> Ellen K. Pao (@ekp, 2018-05-02 23:10): ‘CEOs of big tech companies: You almost certainly have incels as employees. What are you going to do about it?’
[04:17:36] <meowcat> "our software will make your business prosper!" is considered safe. "our chemical will make your body healthy!" is not. this seems like a bias of some dynamics against others.
[04:17:57] <quanticle> "Indeed, as Ms. Holmes’s trial for fraud continues in San Jose, it’s clear that two things can be true. She should be held accountable for her actions as chief executive of Theranos. And it can be sexist to hold her accountable for alleged serious wrongdoing and not hold an array of men accountable for reports of wrongdoing or bad judgment."
[04:17:59] <quanticle> https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/opinion/elizabeth-holmes-trial-sexism.html

[04:18:01] <quanticle> So she cites Adam Neumann and WeWork, Travis Kalanick at Uber, and the Juul folks, but... I think the key distinction is that all of those people had actual products or services that they were selling. Theranos was a pure fraud. Their Edison machine never worked and wasn't on a path to working, and they were straight up lying, outputting fraudulent data.
[04:18:19] <quanticle> Er, didn't mean to repost the link, sorry
[04:18:44] <meowcat> people can lie all day long about software, but it's just considered 'marketing' and so it's not a real lie and so they're not forsworn. but if someone lies about a drug or a chemical for bodies, eventually someone tracks them down and forswears them.
[04:19:32] <quanticle> meowcat: If your software does not make my business prosper, but instead drives me out of business, well, that's bad but recoverable. Next time I'll know better. If your chemical does not make my body healthy, but instead kills me, well, there's no recovering from that.
[04:20:00] <quanticle> I'm entirely okay with there being much much higher standards for health products than there is for CRM software
[04:20:43] <meowcat> agreed. it would be a shitty idea to start holding health companies to software-company standards. this has absolutely zero to do with the CEO's gender, and anyone who says it does is trolling.
[04:20:51] <quanticle> Oh yeah, for sure
[04:21:24] <meowcat> however, this also means that if anyone's health depends on the success of a software company, they are up shit creek.
[04:21:44] <meowcat> and/or socialism, i suppose.
[04:22:03] <quanticle> Yep, welcome to the entire medical device market :(
[04:22:09] <meowcat> aaaaa
[04:22:31] <meowcat> my cpap has an airplane mode
[04:23:49] <meowcat> the whole idea of "airplane mode" is contingent upon a swath of regulations principally in the FAA and TSA... um ... it's real postmodern that someone wrote 'airplane mode' on my medical device.
[04:25:17] <meowcat> this? this is a pump for pumping air on demand up to certain pressure limits. it has a parasite that cares about aerospace regulation.

[04:59:13] <quanticle> So like... the one thing that the yoke is bad at is the thing you have to do yourself lol
[04:59:32] <meowcat> but...that's a constrained slow-speed environment where making beep beep noises actually causes people to get out of your way a little.
[04:59:34] <ggreer> Auto park is decent right now. The main issue is recognizing parking spots
[05:00:20] <quanticle> Ah, okay
[05:01:38] <meowcat> the problem with parking is it's either fitting a standard procedure (parallel parking) to a weird set of constraints (whatever the hell the other people parked like) or it's a tedious wander through a parking lot (or worse, 3d parking structure) with the looming possibility of someone doing something horribly dangerous right in front of you with no warning.

[05:23:03] <shawwwn> The most interesting part was that they needed to fill up the bookshelves with books. But of course no one lives here
[05:23:09] <shawwwn> So it’s all the same book. Almost
[05:23:12] <quanticle> Are they real books?

[05:46:37] <ggreer> Oh yeah. Thanks for the reminder
[05:46:49] <adiabatic> I avoid touching my phone after I've started shooting
[05:46:54] <meowcat> in boy scouts, i was once witness to the scoutmaster telling-off the assistant scoutmaster for referring to our .22 rifles as 'weapons'. good word for the army, not good word for the BSA, apparently.

[05:47:30] <adiabatic> that's what I do, but my skin is picky
[05:47:41] <ggreer> Most guns are weapons. Denying that is just playing political games
[05:48:06] <meowcat> well, these were boy scout camp .22s, so they were intended only for shooting targets.
[05:48:26] <meowcat> using them as weapons would be a pretty big mistake.
[05:48:27] <adiabatic> you could put an eye out with those, though. that's weapon enough

[07:31:52] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: i am trying to train a super simple diffusion related model
[07:32:08] <RiversHaveWings> like bc diffusion math is just too complicated
[07:32:46] <gwern> but the models *are* simpler. it's just a U-net mapping image to image, gaussian noise, and gradient descent on MSE loss or whatever. it's the frigging math that's complicated?
[07:33:12] <RiversHaveWings> demo grid from the end of epoch 6 (it's still improving) https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/NFBXJWZU/demo_00006.png
[07:33:12] <Robomot> image/png (302x302; 71 KB)
[07:34:00] <RiversHaveWings> Yeah so all I do is. During training, I take the reals and I generate noise levels uniformly between 0 and 1 for each of them.
[07:34:14] <RiversHaveWings> Then I lerp between the reals and the noise w/ those weights.
[07:34:37] <RiversHaveWings> And then my loss is MSE(model(noised_reals), reals - noised_reals).
[07:34:46] <RiversHaveWings> That's it.
[07:35:24] <RiversHaveWings> So during sampling, I start fakes off as Gaussian noise. And I do 100 iterations or so of fakes += 0.02 * model(fakes) or whatever lr you want.
[07:35:38] <RiversHaveWings> And then a final step of fakes += model(fakes) to get rid of any noise left in.
[07:35:44] <RiversHaveWings> That's it.
[07:36:45] <RiversHaveWings> In other words the model input is the noisy image and the output is the predicted gradient of the log likelihood of the data.
[07:37:12] <RiversHaveWings> And I do gradient ascent steps on it.
[07:38:53] <RiversHaveWings> The model output is scaled so that if you do a gradient ascent step with lr 1 with its output you get the fully denoised prediction for the end of the diffusion process.

[07:50:25] <Robomot> 'We Would Have Lost': Did U.S. Lend-Lease Aid Tip The Balance In Soviet Fight Against Nazi Germany? (Ever since the Cold War, many Soviet and Russian politicians and academics have downplayed the role that U.S.-provided weapons and supplies played in the Red Army's ultimately victorious campaign against Hitler's Germany. …)
[07:51:22] <quanticle> "Most visibly, the United States provided the Soviet Union with more than 400,000 jeeps and trucks, 14,000 aircraft, 8,000 tractors and construction vehicles, and 13,000 battle tanks. However, the real significance of Lend-Lease for the Soviet war effort was that it covered the 'sensitive points' of Soviet production -- gasoline, explosives, aluminum, nonferrous metals, radio communications, and
[07:51:24] <quanticle> so on, says historian Boris Sokolov."
[07:52:10] <quanticle> You know, for future reference when tankies say, "Well, it was really Stalin who defeated Hitler"
[07:53:28] <quanticle> "'I want to tell you what, from the Russian point of view, the president and the United States have done for victory in this war,' Stalin said. 'The most important things in this war are the machines.... The United States is a country of machines. Without the machines we received through Lend-Lease, we would have lost the war.' Nikita Khrushchev offered the same opinion. 'If the United States
[07:53:30] <quanticle> had not helped us, we would not have won the war,' he wrote in his memoirs. 'One-on-one against Hitler's Germany, we would not have withstood its onslaught and would have lost the war. No one talks about this officially, and Stalin never, I think, left any written traces of his opinion, but I can say that he expressed this view several times in conversations with me.'"
[07:56:05] <quanticle> "In 1963, KGB monitoring recorded Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov saying: 'People say that the allies didn't help us. But it cannot be denied that the Americans sent us materiel without which we could not have formed our reserves or continued the war. The Americans provided vital explosives and gunpowder. And how much steel! Could we really have set up the production of our tanks without American
[07:56:07] <quanticle> steel? And now they are saying that we had plenty of everything on our own.'"
[07:56:36] <quanticle> I feel like only Zhukhov could have gotten away with saying something like that in the face of the historical revisionism that followed the war.

[09:50:46] <rsaarelm> Linux doesn't make it easy to distribute complex closed-source applications. Depends on your viewpoint whether this is a shortcoming or a feature.
[09:52:53] <adiabatic> “Windows 98 stomping on a human face, forever” is a pretty good line
[09:53:14] <quanticle> rsaarelm: Linux doesn't make it easy to distribute open source applications either
[09:54:25] <nshepperd> dynamic linking was a mistake
[09:54:39] <quanticle> With Windows, whether my application is open or closed source, I can distribute a .exe. Maybe I put together a .msi installer. With MacOS, I package up my application as either a .pkg or .dmg. With Linux? At a minimum, I need to support Apt, Yum, and probably Flatpak
[09:55:00] <rsaarelm> You have somewhat higher expectation of distros picking up the trouble of wrapping your application to their package management with open source.
[09:56:02] <rsaarelm> Also you can go "want it running on your special snowflake distro, build or package it yourself"
[09:56:02] <quanticle> Not necessarily! Youtube-dl is a great example: the version in the repos is always hilariously out of date and the official docs state that you should install the one from pip and see if that fixes your issues
[09:56:32] <nshepperd> you actually can just distribute an executable in Linux, you just have to shake yourself out of the drug induced dynamic linking haze first
[09:56:46] <rsaarelm> True, though it's a pretty uncommon case since it's whole MO is playing catch-up with youtube's fuckery.
[09:56:51] <quanticle> nshepperd: I can dynamically link just fine on Windows, though
[09:57:00] <quanticle> Maybe it's Linux that's in the drug induced haze
[09:57:40] <rsaarelm> The Rust compiler is another thing where the out of the box distro version has often been so old that it has messed with my programming.
[09:57:56] <adiabatic> also on macos the youtube-dl and most other things are fresh
[09:57:58] <nshepperd> yeah but why would you want to
[09:58:13] <adiabatic> if I want a recent `bat` on linux, or `fish`, God help me
[09:59:39] <adiabatic> nshepperd: if you're a freewheeler and don't care about the precise version, then it's nice to have Someone Else handle the upgrades
[10:00:34] <adiabatic> I do this with both node and deno and things work out for me tolerably well
[10:01:31] <adiabatic> considering how infrequently I use Go, that'd probably be the winning option for me now as well
[10:03:58] <quanticle> Also, static linking doesn't help as much as you think it would, because fundamentally, Linux isn't as much of a platform as Windows is. This is true even of low level stuff like graphics and sounds.
[10:04:28] <quanticle> On Windows, if you want to draw to the screen, you use Direct2D/Direct3D. If you want to play sounds, there's DirectAudio
[10:04:53] <quanticle> On Linux? X? Wayland? Draw straight to a framebuffer with OpenGL? PulseAudio or PipeWire?
[10:06:18] <nshepperd> well wayland users deserve to be punished for their hubris, so that's one thing ticked off

[14:29:01] <shawwwn> so I asked groq for $400k. It seems to be an accurate market rate for ML engineers.
[14:29:23] <shawwwn> Whether they'll pay it is a different matter. But I think they might do a 3mo contract.
[14:30:17] <shawwwn> One tip for anyone who wants a higher salary: look for a job when you already have a job. It makes things roughly 10 billion times easier. E.g. if groq says no, I'm already at a job I'm happy with.
[14:31:28] <shawwwn> most people don't -- I didn't, at old jobs. but I should've. It's the easiest way to get a 50% raise.

[14:58:51] <shawwwn> I just needed a break, so I've been quiet since monday.
[15:05:29] <shawwwn> I did do one kind of neat thing though. A public burn rate chart https://i.imgur.com/V4ddtpq.png
[15:06:11] <shawwwn> The already-spent charges will show up above the daily balance, so you can just scroll down to see future plans and scroll up to see past expenses
[15:06:31] <shawwwn> $11k gets shockingly far. We're not going to run out of money for like, 4 years
[15:07:07] <shawwwn> it's so much runway that one starts to think of more effective ways to employ it. But I haven't thought of anything that seems impactful enough yet
[15:08:12] <shawwwn> I also made a public donation page, though I don't quite like how it looks yet https://i.imgur.com/2vr7Ddn.png
[15:08:54] <shawwwn> but it can be the equivalent of twitch streamers making a show out of people donating
[15:09:25] <shawwwn> it's still pretty amazing that people sent $2,100 in crypto. I don't even understand what happened to trigger it
[15:09:56] <feep[work]> yay planning~
[15:10:12] <shawwwn> But all in all, $11k + $2.1k is going to last .. uh ... "forever"
[15:10:44] <shawwwn> I seriously almost bought a nice office chair today with $100. I almost convinced myself it was a reasonable use of money
[15:10:59] <shawwwn> but I ended up just buying the $30 chair padding instead (using my own money)
[15:11:03] <feep[work]> ""lifestyle creep""
[15:11:22] <shawwwn> turns out, ikea sells chairs in two parts. There's the frame, and then there's the padding
[15:11:30] <shawwwn> but the padding is pretty much the whole point of the chair
[15:11:32] <feep[work]> (heavy quotation marks because usually people use that to refer to like, new houses and cars. not. like. a chair."
[15:11:35] <feep[work]> )*
[15:11:46] <shawwwn> so you can get the whole point of the chair for only $30 instead of $100
[15:12:03] <shawwwn> and I happen to have an existing chair that sucks, but sucks quite a lot less with this magical $30 padding

[15:23:56] <shawwwn> 1 time quantum of course
[15:23:57] <feepbot> shawwwn: shawwwn left a note 1 minutes, 34 seconds ago: o told ya so, but you didn't listen
[15:24:07] <feep[work]> lol
[15:24:08] <shawwwn> lol at "o"
[15:24:16] <feep[work]> this was before I learnt the beauty of parseIdentifier
[15:24:26] <feep[work]> .reload
[15:24:27] <feepbot> feep[work]: Unauthorized!
[15:24:28] <feep[work]> oyeah
[15:24:33] <shawwwn> I think I prefer it this way
[15:24:37] *** Quits: feepbot (~feepbot@ppp-93-104-168-36.dynamic.mnet-online.de) (Remote host closed the connection)

[15:25:00] *** Joins: feepbot (~feepbot@ppp-93-104-168-36.dynamic.mnet-online.de)
[15:25:23] <feep[work]> shawwwn: try now?
[15:25:24] <shawwwn> looks like 1mo == 30 days?
[15:25:30] <feep[work]> yes
[15:25:38] <shawwwn> nah, I don't have anything to remind myself about in 30 days
[15:25:42] <feep[work]> :)
[15:26:18] <shawwwn> .note shawwwn in 1mo be happier. it's fine not to do everything all at once.
[15:26:26] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], can feepbot query gpt? you could have it say what time they meant >:)
[15:26:39] <feep[work]> nah, even gpt2 is too slow on cpu
[15:26:55] <Gurkenglas> latency or flops?
[15:26:56] <shawwwn> not for 8 tokens 
[15:27:05] <feep[work]> let me rephrase
[15:27:10] <feep[work]> nah, even gpt2 is too slow on the cpu currently running feepbot
[15:27:17] <shawwwn> 8 tokens should only take a few seconds max. but it'd be a massive memory hog
[15:27:28] <shawwwn> unless you're running it on a raspi, I think it'd work
[15:27:43] <feep[work]> like an atom or sth
[15:27:50] <shawwwn> ah
[15:27:59] <shawwwn> buy an edge TPU and supercharge your atom
[15:28:02] <shawwwn> you know you want to
[15:28:08] <feep[work]> nuuu
[15:28:12] <shawwwn> it's only like $150
[15:28:23] <shawwwn> and it appeals to your instincts of owning your own hardware
[15:28:23] <Gurkenglas> you could query 6b.eleuther.ai
[15:28:25] <feep[work]> power costs are crazy here tho.
[15:28:37] <shawwwn> I think it's power efficient
[15:28:42] <feep[work]> muu
[15:28:48] <feep[work]> okay, I will look into this LATER.
[15:28:52] <feep[work]> compiler has prio in my life rn
[15:29:18] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas: feep won't rely on any external service. And sadly I've seen 6b die for long periods of time
[15:29:29] <shawwwn> they did a decent job keeping it up for as long as they did
[15:29:48] <shawwwn> but there's no way to limit token count, so you're always at the mercy of "wait a full minute"
[15:29:59] <shawwwn> and they limit you to one query per IP addr, so no queueing
[15:30:13] <shawwwn> unless you fire up tor circuits
[15:30:24] <shawwwn> which would be a nice way to DoS them. Hmm
[15:30:49] <PapuaHardyNet> https://www.raptorcs.com/content/TL2WK2/intro.html
[15:30:50] <Robomot> Raptor Computing Systems::TL2WK2 Intro (Talos™ II Secure Workstation)
[15:30:58] <Gurkenglas> responsible disclosure, dude. even when the vulnerability is 101 :P
[15:31:35] <shawwwn> .note shawwwn in 7d DoS 6b.eleuther.ai using tor circuits. Just kidding. (If someone actually did this, Gurkenglas is a reasonable suspect.)
[15:32:03] <PapuaHardyNet> aww come on, imagine if eleutherai put up a cloudflare over 6b
[15:32:16] <Gurkenglas> .note Gurkenglas in 7d don't give shawwwn any infohazards
[15:32:21] <PapuaHardyNet> would be so painful
[15:33:01] <PapuaHardyNet> oh wait, there are better ways to DoS 6b
[15:33:06] <shawwwn> someone racked up a $3k bill on our firebase blaze plan. No reason, they just felt like firing up 500 scripts. I even watched them do it in real time
[15:33:20] <kuudes> feep[work], is gwernpasting working?
[15:33:20] <shawwwn> so I have empathy for eleuther
[15:33:55] <shawwwn> them keeping it up as long as they have is a small miracle. I hope they manage to solidify it and give OpenAI a run for their money

[15:46:54] <shawwwn> sneaky
[15:47:12] <PapuaHardyNet> using feepbot as a task management system
[15:47:15] <shawwwn> inb4 feep patches that, rather than removing the 3 limit

[15:52:29] * feep[work] returns
[15:52:30] * feep[work] reads up
[15:52:37] <feep[work]> I feel like ... I should have predicted this...? but I did not
[15:52:51] <shawwwn> .note Obormot\Arcturus in 3mo My dearest Obormot, I think of you often. Ever since you ignored me, my days have been incomplete. I leave this time capsule as a plea for you to reconsider. Let's bury the hatchet ~~in your back~~ and bake a cake together. I know you know all the best recipes; which would you recommend? Actually some kind of pie would be nice.
[15:53:09] <feep[work]> oy, no using feepbot to bypass ignores.
[15:53:15] <feep[work]> I take that personally.
[15:53:22] <shawwwn> as you should
[15:53:25] <shawwwn> I'm a pro bot abuser, after all
[15:53:31] <shawwwn> better watch out
[15:54:20] <shawwwn> probably gonna remove the message rather than let me have my fun huh. well, whatever
[15:54:51] <yorick> um
[15:55:31] <shawwwn> it's not like you stuck up for me when obormot decided to ignore me for no reason and also shutoff robomot for no reason and only agreed to unignore me for this one channel
[15:55:38] <PapuaHardyNet> you know, whenever someone says "um" I get anxiety
[15:55:47] <PapuaHardyNet> as in a message with just "um"
[15:56:04] *** linear_ is now known as linear
[15:56:10] <shawwwn> hmm. surprisingly, xanax is a cure for anxiety
[15:56:24] <shawwwn> you can probably get one, but try not to take them regularly
[15:56:30] <PapuaHardyNet> i got my current internship using diazepines actually
[15:56:38] <shawwwn> oh?
[15:56:40] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah
[15:57:13] <PapuaHardyNet> I always try to keep antidepressants, anti-opiates, and diazepines at hand for mental emergencies
[15:58:03] <shawwwn> smart. I was regretting not having a stash of silagra the other day
[15:58:25] <feep[work]> shawwwn: this is purely pragmatic on my part
[15:58:36] <synthmeat> i never leave home without xanax
[15:58:44] <feep[work]> if people bypass ignore with note, then people will hate feepbot and want to remove it
[15:59:12] <shawwwn> congratulations on being like iceland during ww2
[16:00:00] <feep[work]> yay
[16:00:07] <PapuaHardyNet> i would take diazepines before dates began, and sometimes during dates
[16:00:27] <shawwwn> I'm just happy to hear you're dating at all
[16:00:32] <PapuaHardyNet> ouch
[16:00:36] <shawwwn> not at all
[16:00:41] <shawwwn> it takes guts
[16:01:03] <shawwwn> I've often tried to convince certain unnamed people here to go on some
[16:01:07] <shawwwn> two, actually.
[16:01:14] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern and obormot?
[16:01:25] <shawwwn> haha. half credit
[16:02:13] <shawwwn> so yes, don't sell yourself short that you're actually out looking for people. Lots of others just go full hermit
[16:02:54] <PapuaHardyNet> i'll keep that in mind :)
[16:03:05] <shawwwn> I was going to suggest that if you have anxiety about dates, you might be approaching it wrong -- just be yourself. But
[16:03:32] <shawwwn> I remember literally shaking during one
[16:03:40] <shawwwn> so it's not like I can talk
[16:04:03] <shawwwn> it's one of those "it's true though" things. The annoying truths that you don't quite know what to do about
[16:04:25] <shawwwn> like yeah, dates would go a lot better if you'd just be yourself. But it's not ever quite so easy as flipping a switch
[16:05:19] <feep[work]> going weekend in 25m
[16:05:19] <shawwwn> what's the dating scene like these days, anyway? I've always been curious about tinder and grindr
[16:05:24] * feep[work] hype for weekends
[16:05:27] <PapuaHardyNet> pain
[16:05:33] <shawwwn> ah
[16:05:47] <PapuaHardyNet> also I'm too scared to touch grindr - at least girls wouldn't look at me like I'm a piece of meat
[16:06:45] <PapuaHardyNet> re grindr - i need to clarify that i'm not picky about the person as long as they are attractive and feminine. just to make things clear
[16:06:54] <kuudes> feep[work], have you checked if gwernpastes are working?
[16:07:01] <kuudes> either gwern has had nothing to say or they are not
[16:07:24] <feep[work]> gwern has had nothing to say.
[16:07:59] *** Joins: galambo (galambo@user/galambo)
[16:08:08] <PapuaHardyNet> blasphemy
[16:08:52] <shawwwn> PapuaHardyNet: believe it or not, I know what you mean, and you're right. I did try grindr, but striking up a conversation isn't... a thing
[16:09:20] <shawwwn> it's basically "send photo now pls: the game"
[16:09:53] <feep[work]> pics or it won't happen
[16:10:24] <shawwwn> I guess a lot of people are into that, since it seems like only those people are on there. good for them, I guess
[16:10:29] <kuudes> huh, thats new
[16:10:46] *** Quits: galambo__ (galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[16:12:11] <shawwwn> feep[work]: why are you working exactly down to the minute?
[16:12:17] <shawwwn> are you a contractor?
[16:12:27] <feep[work]> shawwwn: nah, I have flextime, I just wanna save up some overtime~
[16:12:36] <shawwwn> being around / responsive to slack is enough to count as working
[16:12:47] <shawwwn> which is to say, just put your laptop on full volume and then begin your weekend now
[16:12:59] <feep[work]> I mean, I have loopy open on the other monitor
[16:13:12] <feep[work]> but I cannot do compiler things while on worktime due to copyright issues
[16:13:15] <shawwwn> then what exactly does the 23 minutes consist of
[16:13:34] <feep[work]> bit more review, bit of wiki editing~
[16:13:49] <shawwwn> I almost empathize with your position, but it seems mistaken
[16:13:54] <shawwwn> I would've felt similarly
[16:14:08] <shawwwn> do you use a separate computer for work vs home?
[16:14:17] <feep[work]> I work from work, so  yes
[16:14:29] <feep[work]> we don't have a wfh setup
[16:14:33] <shawwwn> wait, you literally are at a workplace during covid?
[16:14:35] <feep[work]> yep
[16:14:40] <shawwwn> what the fuck, run
[16:14:46] <shawwwn> new job immediately time
[16:14:48] <feep[work]> XD
[16:14:52] <feep[work]> they're p much all like that here
[16:14:53] <shawwwn> are you even sane
[16:14:58] <PapuaHardyNet> germans
[16:15:27] <feep[work]> I mean, I'm vaccinated, 34 and have no breathing disorders
[16:15:37] <shawwwn> man, you've been missing out on the most amazing work life balance you'll ever know
[16:15:39] <feep[work]> what's *really* fucky is that my coworker with asthma has to come in some days
[16:15:53] <shawwwn> wfh is literally a godsend for those of us who aways pretended to work at work
[16:16:02] <feep[work]> shawwwn: you're missing something here
[16:16:04] <shawwwn> you no longer have to pretend
[16:16:08] <feep[work]> I tried three days of wfh last winter
[16:16:13] <feep[work]> they were atrociously terrible and I hated them
[16:16:31] <shawwwn> I feel this is almost solely due to your environment, OR because the company doesn't embrace wfh culture
[16:16:34] <shawwwn> I suspect the latter
[16:16:48] <feep[work]> nah, p sure I just cannot into wfh
[16:16:55] <shawwwn> mm.
[16:17:12] <feep[work]> I need a work-home division for mental health.
[16:17:22] <shawwwn> you'd rather be sitting there, pretending to work, for 23 minutes, than do compiler things?
[16:17:31] <feep[work]> I mean, I will do work things.
[16:17:36] <feep[work]> review, editing wiki is a work thing
[16:17:41] <shawwwn> and irc
[16:17:53] <feep[work]> I grant you that irc is not very worky
[16:17:59] <kuudes> shawwwn, in europe people have vacations and time off
[16:18:01] <feep[work]> but I don't care about the copyright on feepbot :p
[16:18:08] <shawwwn> it's interesting the lies we tell ourselves to feel comfortable
[16:18:22] <kuudes> ie if you work today more, you can work tomorrow less the same amount
[16:18:26] <shawwwn> such as "I am working at work"
[16:18:36] <kuudes> and you can even gather half hours per week and then later have extra days off
[16:18:44] <feep[work]> what kuudes says
[16:18:49] <shawwwn> but you can work less both now and later
[16:18:52] <kuudes> no
[16:18:55] <shawwwn> yes
[16:19:06] <kuudes> in usa, where people don't keep vacations, that is indeed so
[16:19:10] <kuudes> over here, it is not
[16:19:16] <feep[work]> I'm gonna work now and a lot less later~
[16:19:23] * feep[work] saving up
[16:19:31] <shawwwn> I mean... okay... but like
[16:19:37] <kuudes> over here it is criminal for employer to have people work too much
[16:19:50] <kuudes> there are overtime caps etc
[16:20:05] <kuudes> criminal as in a boss goes to prison or pays fines, and company does too
[16:20:14] <shawwwn> for example, today my 8 hour workday consisted of around 30 minutes of actual work. I coordinated with <massive bank> to try to get access to their API systems, which are protected by requiring people to do around 30 steps
[16:20:29] <shawwwn> the rest of the day was spent waiting for them to respond, during which I was responsive to slack
[16:20:49] <kuudes> do you have a hourlog?
[16:20:56] <feep[work]> I do
[16:20:59] <shawwwn> yes, and I'll be claiming the 8 hours
[16:21:19] <kuudes> frauding hourlog is a proper cause for termination
[16:21:32] <shawwwn> I take offense to the idea that this is fraud
[16:21:36] <kuudes> but in usa anything is proper cause for termination in at-will states, so it does not matter
[16:21:36] <feep[work]> kuudes: to be clear, nobody over here cares about keeping that accurate either
[16:21:42] <kuudes> yes
[16:21:58] <kuudes> though if you get in trouble, they might check those
[16:21:59] <shawwwn> firstly, I am moving the banking project along faster than anyone else is in a position to
[16:22:10] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[16:22:11] <shawwwn> secondly, "waiting on <big bank>" is a totally valid blocker
[16:22:13] <feep[work]> it is 10m to weekend and a colleague just came to me with a crash issue
[16:22:18] <feep[work]> I can already tell how this friday will go.
[16:22:21] <kuudes> :-p
[16:22:27] <kuudes> you should have quit while ahead
[16:22:45] <shawwwn> thirdly, being responsive to slack *is most of what people pay you for*. Being available to answer questions and solve problems is immensely valuable
[16:22:56] <kuudes> yes, so you were actually working 8 hours
[16:23:07] <kuudes> (over here it is not 8 hours but 7,5 h)
[16:23:10] <shawwwn> hence why I am claiming 8 hours, yes.
[16:23:15] <kuudes> yes
[16:23:41] <shawwwn> but the work consisted of "make sure I respond to slack immediately, and wait for further communication from <big bank>"
[16:24:03] <shawwwn> this is approximately dream job status, since I can do other things in parallel
[16:24:14] <shawwwn> by not wfh, you're seriously missing out
[16:25:07] <shawwwn> the point is, I get that mental health work/home separation is a thing. But go to a coffee shop
[16:25:39] <shawwwn> or rent one of those places you can work from. They're not that expensive. Had one in Chicago
[16:26:58] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[16:27:34] <shawwwn> your employers, if they're smart, don't want you to work 7.5 hours per day. No one can put in 7.5h of mental effort every day
[16:27:57] <shawwwn> I didn't have a job for years and I could barely  do that each day without burning out instantly
[16:28:27] <shawwwn> the myth that people work 7.5h every day at work is so strong that literally everyone just pretends to do things to fill time
[16:29:13] <shawwwn> so it's painful that you felt like doing compiler things but chose to irc from work instead
[16:29:37] <shawwwn> enjoy your weekend instead of that BS and find a less hostile job
[16:29:42] <shawwwn> they exist
[16:29:52] <shawwwn> unless you really like wki reviewing

[16:33:08] <shawwwn> funny story about my work today though
[16:33:15] <shawwwn> so the goal is to access <big bank>'s API
[16:34:10] <shawwwn> I'll refer to them as BBC, because my employer wants Big Bank's C... API
[16:34:26] <shawwwn> but of course BBC is a massive corporate entity
[16:34:57] <shawwwn> for those of you fortunate enough never to have worked at a massive corporate entity, imagine thousands of people in a single room, for 10 years, trying to get anything done
[16:35:11] <shawwwn> it's utter chaos
[16:35:34] <shawwwn> so it was no surprise that BBC's APIs are approximately impossible to use
[16:35:56] <shawwwn> the surprise was *why* it's impossible
[16:36:15] <shawwwn> I was bracing for some kind of kafkaesque API monstrosity
[16:36:24] <shawwwn> but in fact their API is pretty straightforward
[16:36:35] <shawwwn> you POST to /balance, and it shows your balance
[16:36:45] <PapuaHardyNet> how much do you think high performers (like people here) really can work (with focus) in a day
[16:37:25] <shawwwn> even that was a minor miracle as far as I'm concerned (my answer to that is, 6 hour bursts. Carmack could do 14. Most of us aren't Carmack.)
[16:38:01] <shawwwn> so why was POST to /balance impossible to use? well
[16:38:13] <shawwwn> because of Le Security
[16:38:25] <shawwwn> Le Security is a meme that only appears in massive companies
[16:38:41] <shawwwn> you see, banks like Scottrade and Thomson Reuters have a security department
[16:38:56] <shawwwn> and the security department has approximately infinite power
[16:39:14] <shawwwn> so they require as many Le Security memes as possible, at every step
[16:39:45] <shawwwn> in BBC's case, they require their users to have a signed certificate from one of <specific list of cert authorities>
[16:39:51] <shawwwn> JUST FOR THEIR TEST ENVIRONMENT
[16:40:02] <shawwwn> YOU CANNOT POST /balance EVEN AS A TEST USER WITHOUT THIS
[16:40:11] <shawwwn> the certs cost $1k each
[16:40:32] <shawwwn> my employer literally spent $2k on two certs from DigiCert
[16:40:43] <shawwwn> the best part, and the punchline I've been building up to...
[16:41:15] <shawwwn> somehow, the person that generated the two CSRs managed to lose one of the private keys. It wasn't in the zip file that my boss sent over
[16:41:49] <shawwwn> after questioning boss on the status of private key, and pointing out that private key is required for private key things, boss adds person who generated certificate requests to the slack convo
[16:42:06] <feep[work]> back
[16:42:09] <shawwwn> they say "hmm, nothing in my 1password except the certificate requests. I'll try looking tomorrow"
[16:42:09] <feep[work]> okay it was harmless
[16:42:15] <feep[work]> random machine gremlins
[16:42:38] <shawwwn> so my employer may as well have lit $1,000 on fire
[16:43:27] <shawwwn> and we're in a situation where we may need to buy yet another $1k cert, and ask BBC to reauthorize us, *just* to curl -X POSt /balance and get back "your test account has $42 in it"
[16:43:28] <feep[work]> ouch
[16:43:52] <shawwwn> I fucking love big companies. this rules
[16:44:08] <shawwwn> seeing this level of dysfunction is not a thing in any other job
[16:44:21] <feep[work]> shawwwn: in positive news
[16:44:33] <feep[work]> I got to merge "git rm -r *" on a repo today~
[16:44:45] <feep[work]> (history got merged with another repo)
[16:44:48] <feep[work]> (it was still fun)
[16:45:05] <feep[work]> amazing -loc velocity
[16:45:20] <shawwwn> lol. that repo history was worth preserving, I suppose
[16:45:32] <shawwwn> I guess I'd do the same thing rather than make a new repo
[16:45:35] <feep[work]> yeah for submodule references and build repro
[16:45:42] <shawwwn> oh boy, submodules
[16:45:49] <shawwwn> I bet that wasn't a regrettable decision
[16:45:49] <feep[work]> what, submodules are love submodules are life
[16:46:01] <feep[work]> I love em
[16:46:05] <feep[work]> what's wrong with it?
[16:47:01] <shawwwn> probably the same thing that's wrong with absolutely refusing to ever interact with a 96 core 335GB RAM 8x MXU with 16GB each TPU, just because it happens to be running in Google's server farm
[16:47:15] <shawwwn> but I'll earmark it as cultural differences :P
[16:47:20] <feep[work]> idgi
[16:47:37] <feep[work]> do you have actual known problems with submodules?
[16:47:42] <shawwwn> "we have different tastes" 
[16:47:52] <feep[work]> I mean, I don't even get what about submodules is a taste thing
[16:48:17] <shawwwn> are you really daring me to throw down? 'cause I will
[16:48:25] <shawwwn> sure
[16:48:37] <feep[work]> yeah I'm curious
[16:48:45] <shawwwn> not only are there problems with submodules, but entire tomes have been written about the perils of using them
[16:48:49] <feep[work]> link?
[16:49:17] <shawwwn> google.com/search?q=why+submodules+suck
[16:49:21] <feep[work]> lol
[16:49:33] <shawwwn> I'm serious, it wasn't a flippant answer
[16:49:50] <shawwwn> literally any link on that will go into detail about how many problems they cause
[16:49:58] <feep[work]> do you mean https://codingkilledthecat.wordpress.com/2012/04/28/why-your-company-shouldnt-use-git-submodules/
[16:49:58] <Robomot> Why your company shouldn’t use Git submodules | Coding Killed the Cat (A programmer had a version control problem and said, “I know, I’ll use submodules.” Now they have two problems. It is not uncommon at all when working on any kind of larger-scale …)
[16:50:13] <shawwwn> but, to name a few
[16:50:41] <shawwwn> for one, merging becomes an absolute clusterfuck of cross-module interdependencies
[16:51:00] <feep[work]> I don't understand that one
[16:51:00] <shawwwn> because rarely are you ever touching just one module in isolation
[16:51:13] <feep[work]> hang on, what are you advocating as an alternative, no code reuse?
[16:51:38] <shawwwn> not at all. personally, I'm a monolith fan
[16:51:48] <feep[work]> because that seems like a general problem with any code reuse solution (that is not monolith)
[16:51:54] <feep[work]> we do have monolith fans at $corp
[16:52:06] <shawwwn> I respect the arguments against monoliths
[16:52:17] <shawwwn> I just don't see them as outweighing the downsides of non-monoliths
[16:52:27] <feep[work]> shawwwn: okay, but you agree that this is a problem with any code reuse solution that has separate repos, not submodules in specific, right?
[16:52:53] <shawwwn> it *can* be a problem. But lerna is a better solution
[16:52:57] <feep[work]> reading a page on submodule problems and it just sounds like the author has configured their git wrong
[16:53:01] <feep[work]> and not installed powerline-shell
[16:53:19] <shawwwn> it mimics a monolith, without the downsides of separate repos
[16:53:26] <shawwwn> after all, it's a monorepo. Mono meaning one
[16:53:30] <feep[work]> shawwwn: rephrasing
[16:53:44] <shawwwn> I've always wanted something like lerna but for python
[16:53:45] <feep[work]> shawwwn: do you have any problems that are specific to submodules as opposed to all multirepo setups?
[16:53:47] <shawwwn> surprised it doesn't exist
[16:54:02] <shawwwn> yes I do
[16:54:06] <feep[work]> giv
[16:54:07] <PapuaHardyNet> submodules are complex
[16:54:11] <catern> submodules are trash
[16:54:20] <PapuaHardyNet> too complex for me that's for sure
[16:54:29] <feep[work]> git is complex... submodules add almost no complexity on top
[16:54:30] <shawwwn> submodules require specific version pinning. this is basically why I can't use them
[16:54:33] <catern> my company's primary workflow is with a repo containing 5000 submodule
[16:54:42] <feep[work]> shawwwn: we already mandate version pinning as a matter of code style
[16:54:56] <feep[work]> catern: what the actual fuck
[16:55:13] <shawwwn> forcing a submodule to be at commit X is equal to version pinning. And I just can't. Maybe others can, and I respect them for being able to
[16:55:14] <catern> they made a frequently-broken wrapper for git to make it work better but it still sucks https://github.com/twosigma/git-meta
[16:55:15] <Robomot> GitHub - twosigma/git-meta: Repository for the git-meta project -- build your own monorepo using Git submodules (Repository for the git-meta project -- build your own monorepo using Git submodules - GitHub - twosigma/git-meta: Repository for the git-meta project -- build your own monorepo using Git submodules)
[16:55:32] <catern> use a package manager for god's sake
[16:55:32] <shawwwn> but backporting bugfixes becomes a nightmare
[16:55:34] <catern> don't use submodules
[16:55:35] <feep[work]> shawwwn: I mean, I see your view (we have a tool that makes it easier) but that really seems a general code style difference
[16:56:01] <shawwwn> yes. to be clear, the reason submodules are insidious, is because there's nothing *wrong* with them per se. They work
[16:56:12] <shawwwn> you can indeed Do Code using them
[16:56:21] <feep[work]> shawwwn: we use pinning, and at the start of ~ every new feature branch we do check-externals -u -y, which is an internal tool that updates every dependency to newest supported
[16:56:44] <shawwwn> I just prefer to Do Code in a way that doesn't want to make me prefer mashing my balls repeatedly in a windowsill
[16:56:46] <feep[work]> we have an internal website that shows how aged repos are too, and how many versions of each repo are in use
[16:56:48] <shawwwn> since that would be less painful
[16:56:53] <catern> version pinning is fine and good, submodules just suck because they're just a really poorly implemented git feature
[16:57:06] <feep[work]> catern: okay, explain? I don't know what the concrete complaint is
[16:57:44] <shawwwn> also go home, stop being at work
[16:57:49] <shawwwn> you're long past the 23 minute mark
[16:57:55] <feep[work]> no this is work now
[16:57:55] <shawwwn> weekend time has begun
[16:57:56] <feep[work]> XD
[16:58:00] <shawwwn> no
[16:58:10] <shawwwn> no one is allowed to talk to feep until he clocks off
[16:58:16] <feep[work]> shawwwn: um, part of the background assumption here is that we really want reproducible builds, because we have multiple versions of our code in production
[16:58:18] <shawwwn> he's delusional and hurting himself
[16:58:31] <feep[work]> so we want to be able to go back to an old state at any time and build a patch release
[16:58:36] <shawwwn> it's our responsibility not to let him waste his precious time that he'll never get back
[16:58:49] <feep[work]> that's why everything is pinned, submodules, tools, build system docker image
[16:59:00] * shawwwn nods and smiles
[16:59:07] <shawwwn> you are right, my friend
[16:59:23] <feep[work]> catern: anyway, what's your concrete issue with submodules in specific?
[16:59:29] <catern> feep[work]: to preface my explanation, what do your submodules point to? third-party libraries or your own stuff?
[16:59:34] <feep[work]> own stuff
[16:59:39] <feep[work]> we have a separate package manager for third-party
[16:59:42] * shawwwn glares at catern
[17:00:04] <catern> shawwwn: why shouldn't I help feep waste time at work?
[17:00:34] <feep[work]> not even all that strictly speaking, "becoming aware of issues with our git setup" is genuinely a worthwhile use of work time
[17:00:36] <shawwwn> well, feep is suffering from a medical emergency right now. or at least mild mental illness
[17:00:55] <shawwwn> since he's choosing to be physically present at work on a weekend for zero reason
[17:01:00] <shawwwn> and while not getting paid for it
[17:01:05] <feep[work]> what? I'm getting paid for this
[17:01:07] <feep[work]> we have flextime
[17:01:12] <shawwwn> okay well
[17:01:21] <feep[work]> I would *not* be here if I wasn't being paid lol.
[17:01:27] <shawwwn> true or false: you're paid a salary
[17:01:43] <feep[work]> I don't know what the precise difference is
[17:01:44] <catern> feep[work]: okay I was just going to write a lot of text but let me just say, merging and rebasing changes in the presence of submodules is horrible
[17:01:48] <feep[work]> I'm paid for time
[17:02:04] <shawwwn> are you paid hourly? you literally track all of your hours, and receive less money per year?
[17:02:17] <feep[work]> no, I'm paid for a fixed amount of hours per month, which is tracked
[17:02:24] <feep[work]> but I can save up hours and take time off later
[17:02:41] <feep[work]> ie. the pay is the same, but the worktime can be moved around (within reason).
[17:02:59] <feep[work]> == flextime
[17:03:22] <catern> feep[work]: also lots of git things need to be configured or changed to work with submodules properly
[17:03:23] <feep[work]> catern: I mean, I guess it's kinda annoying, you have to keep gitk open in a side window to keep track of which commit is where
[17:03:28] <catern> e.g. git log and git show
[17:03:40] <shawwwn> congratulations, you are somehow convincing yourself that arguing about submodules on irc without getting paid more cash during the prime of your life (which will never come again) is a reasonable tradeoff
[17:03:42] <feep[work]> gitk shows submodules by default
[17:03:44] <kuudes> well, actually the work hours per month vary per the days in month
[17:04:01] <feep[work]> catern: afaik the only thing that needs to be changed is recursive=true
[17:04:13] <feep[work]> and powerline-shell
[17:04:23] <feep[work]> which visualizes git state in your bash prompt
[17:04:32] <feep[work]> and which I consider indispensable
[17:05:10] <shawwwn> .note shawwwn in 4mo 3w 11d 7h 47m 33s assassinate catern
[17:05:16] <feep[work]> catern: I guess one relevant factor is that we usually don't get all that much merge contention, maybe two people on a repo or so
[17:05:33] <feep[work]> per sprint
[17:05:49] <feep[work]> usually one
[17:06:11] <shawwwn> .note shawwwn in 3 days remind feep to remove the 3 note limit for self reminders
[17:06:12] <feepbot> shawwwn: Cannot leave more than three messages for somebody! 
[17:06:33] <feep[work]> just make a calendar ;.;
[17:06:52] <catern> shawwwn: actually I got bored with talking about submodules (that's how much I hate them) so I stopped talking
[17:07:02] <feep[work]> lol okay
[17:07:05] <shawwwn> are you really going to be like "yeah, feepbot is working as designed" when I literally can't leave myself any more reminders for a few months?
[17:07:23] <shawwwn> just gimme source code access and I'll submit a PR
[17:07:27] <feep[work]> shawwwn: very tempted to say "yes" here, but I'm probably just gonna drop the limit for pm self-notes.
[17:07:36] <feep[work]> where they don't spam the channel
[17:07:48] <shawwwn> what
[17:07:53] <shawwwn> no, don't do that 
[17:08:16] <shawwwn> the only reason the reminders are interesting is precisely *because* it's not hidden away in some calendar system nobody sees
[17:08:32] <feep[work]> but that's the reason for the limit, prevent feepbot from channelspamming
[17:08:42] <shawwwn> the idea that it's spamming the channel is flawed in the same way the idea that me speaking now = spamming, is flawed
[17:08:51] <shawwwn> the limit doesn't make sense for timed notes
[17:09:00] <feep[work]> hm, that's true
[17:09:12] <shawwwn> I get that there's a 3 note limit to prevent feep from suddenly carpetbombing notes
[17:09:38] <shawwwn> but for *timed* notes, that becomes a nonissue, since they're all delivered at different times
[17:09:53] <shawwwn> and yes, someone could theoretically schedule a notebomb for some time in the future for lulz. But I won't
[17:09:53] <feep[work]> seems like it'd be a trivial way to bypass a limit tho
[17:10:00] <shawwwn> it already is trivial
[17:10:05] *** shawwwn is now known as shawwwn2
[17:10:32] <shawwwn2> .note shawwwn in 3 days remind feep that it's trivial to bypass the 3 note limit
[17:10:38] *** shawwwn2 is now known as shawwwn
[17:10:45] <shawwwn> so yes, I can just do that
[17:11:01] <shawwwn> and you can add increasingly complicated steps to prevent things like that
[17:11:06] <shawwwn> or just remove the limit for timed notes
[17:11:09] <PapuaHardyNet> .note .note in 1 sec .note
[17:11:15] <shawwwn> and trust us to be Good Adults
[17:11:25] <feep[work]> I definitely do not trust you in specific to be a good adult :v
[17:11:33] <PapuaHardyNet> .note feepbot in 1 sec .note test
[17:11:42] <feep[work]> I'll probably raise the limit to 5 to begin with, see where we stand with that
[17:12:01] <shawwwn> same problem. I already have year long notes queued up
[17:12:04] <feep[work]> you're right that selfnotes should be unlimited, I'm staring at the code rn and not fully understanding how it works tho
[17:12:23] <shawwwn> just change 3 to 99 and be done with it
[17:12:32] <PapuaHardyNet> this is why you should use C or python
[17:12:52] <shawwwn> that's the first mistaken thing you've said about programming I think
[17:13:35] <PapuaHardyNet> surely not the first time
[17:13:36] <shawwwn> feepbot wouldn't be 10% as awesome
[17:13:50] <shawwwn> nah you've had a surprisingly flawless record. i was surprised
[17:14:14] <PapuaHardyNet> btw shawwwn, I wanted to show you this: https://github.com/deepmind/tensor_annotations

[17:14:45] <shawwwn> lol at auth
[17:14:59] <feep[work]> shawwwn: limit to a target is now five across the board, limit to yourself should not apply anymore
[17:15:11] <PapuaHardyNet> sweet
[17:15:43] <shawwwn> feep[work]: this doesn't solve the problem. I want to leave gwern notes that deliver years from now
[17:15:59] <shawwwn> the moment I do, I'll hit the 5 limit and change my nick anyway
[17:16:13] <shawwwn> but thanks for making self reminders unlimited
[17:16:17] <feep[work]> shawwwn: if gwern wants to receive notes that deliver years from now he can tell me that
[17:16:25] <PapuaHardyNet> but how do you know that it was really you that sent the note?
[17:16:31] *** PapuaHardyNet is now known as shawwwwn
[17:16:32] <feep[work]> that sounds like the sort of thing that people will generally not want
[17:16:43] <shawwwn> what do you mean? Are you saying that my already-scheduled notes won't deliver to gwern in slightly less than one year from now?
[17:16:46] <shawwwwn> .note shawwwn in 25 days don't trust gwern, he's planning something
[17:17:04] <feep[work]> shawwwn: there's ... feepbot can as things stand be abused for spam
[17:17:10] <feep[work]> but I have at least limited the damage
[17:17:18] <feep[work]> or rather, the effort/damage ratio
[17:17:57] <shawwwn> no no,  this is important -- are you saying that you're refusing to deliver intentional, non-abuse, multiyear notes to their recipients?
[17:18:11] <feep[work]> define non-abuse
[17:18:15] <shawwwn> that'd be a bit like gmail refusing to let you send a timed email, wouldn't you say?
[17:18:30] <feep[work]> the problem is that I cannot determine what is a non-abuse note from looking.
[17:18:42] <shawwwn> if gwern has a problem with it, he can complain then. it's not your place to preempt his wishes
[17:18:45] <shawwwwn> https://begriffs.com/posts/2015-04-20-going-write-only.html
[17:18:46] <Robomot> Going "Write-Only"
[17:18:48] <feep[work]> rather, it is that I refuse to categorically exclude delivering intentional, abuse notes
[17:19:01] <feep[work]> which would require shuttering the feature
[17:19:03] <shawwwwn> "Joey Hess inspires me. He lives in a cabin and programs Haskell on a drastically under-powered netbook. He harvests all his electricity from the sun with a homemade electrical system. Joey has designed his computing life to be highly distributed like the git version control he loves.

[17:19:07] <feep[work]> but that I *do* attempt to limit their damage.

[17:19:47] <shawwwn> shawwwwn: although I appreciate a good meme, there's not room for the two of us. I can barely handle one of me
[17:20:11] <shawwwn> feep[work]: yeah sorry, I was under the impression that you were unbiased
[17:20:21] <feep[work]> shawwwn: I am certainly not unopinionated :P
[17:20:40] <feep[work]> feepbot is not a pure service provider.
[17:20:45] <feep[work]> I want people to like it.
[17:20:54] <feep[work]> this brings me joy.
[17:21:12] <shawwwn> and why wouldn't gwern like receiving notes from his colleague years from now?Or saturn2 getting a thank-you in three years?
[17:21:23] <feep[work]> as such, I *generally* try to avoid feepbot being party in people's annoyance.
[17:21:38] <shawwwwn> oh wait, what's my nick right now?
[17:21:40] <shawwwn> You're just crazy and projecting your craziness. But that's fine -- everyone is, in their own way
[17:21:48] <feep[work]> shawwwn: I wouldn't like getting randomly spammed with notes, and so I presume that this is a position that some people hold
[17:22:02] <Betawolf> Does anyone other than shawwwn send timed reminders to other people?
[17:22:05] <feep[work]> shawwwn: look, if you wanna change my mind on this, run a strawpoll :p
[17:22:08] <shawwwn> no. no one would prefer not to receive a thank-you
[17:22:17] <shawwwn> approximately no one.
[17:22:22] <feep[work]> it's not like you don't have the tools to gather opinions instead of presuming just as hard
[17:22:36] <shawwwn> well, that settles it
[17:22:44] <shawwwn> I was thinking about rolling my own lesswrong bot
[17:22:48] <feep[work]> SHAWWN I TOLD YOU
[17:22:57] <feep[work]> **FUCKING DO IT** BOTS ARE AMAZING
[17:23:20] <feep[work]> feepbot has consistently been one of my most useful, most enjoyed projects.

[19:59:39] <feep> it would look eminently stupid to even write it out
[19:59:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... wow
[20:00:10] <kuudes> o_o
[20:00:35] <kuudes> isn't it just impolite to presume gender on internet?
[20:00:53] <feep> idk what I go by, it's something with nicknames
[20:00:58] <feep> it's like a coloring thing my brain does
[20:01:09] <feep> I think it's a kiki-bouba thing?
[20:01:23] <kuudes> I like internet because it should reduce meaning of things like gender
[20:01:53] <kuudes> in our language we don't have gendered pronouns, so it is often a bit tedious to try to learn everyone's genders beforehand to address them properly
[20:02:19] <kuudes> I guess for french it would be even more tedious, given you have to declinate words per gender of people
[20:02:35] <nshepperd2> Avtomat Kalashnikova, lol
[20:02:49] <PapuaHardyNet> tbh I assume everyone is male until proven otherwise
[20:03:09] <PapuaHardyNet> very reliable heuristic
[20:04:25] <kuudes> do you also assume all of them like girls?
[20:06:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who cares what they like
[20:06:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> This ain't a dating site
[20:08:05] <two2thehead> feep, that femshepperd idea *would* work :V
[20:09:53] <PapuaHardyNet> what obormot said
[20:10:21] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't assume my colleagues are all heterosexual at my workplace - I don't even think about it
[20:10:44] <kuudes> well who cares what gender they are either? for the same reason
[20:11:05] <PapuaHardyNet> ? I assume a gender because it makes it easier for me to communicate
[20:11:17] <kuudes> well, don't?
[20:11:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because we gotta use pronouns, obviously
[20:11:47] <kuudes> how large fraction of rationalists are trans again?
[20:12:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> All of them probably, who knows
[20:12:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why does that matter
[20:12:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> We don't yet have that language from the Culture books where there's no gendered pronouns, we speak English, we gotta pick one
[20:12:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you want to protest this by defaulting to "she" you're welcome to
[20:13:10] <kuudes> I default to them
[20:13:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Lame
[20:13:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (They did the default-to-"she" thing in the main culture in the "Ancillary <stuff>" book series and it was an interesting conceit)

[22:22:37] <ggreer> like... can people sense the earth's magnetic field to some degree or is our sense of direction purely based on inertial sensing, memory, visual cues, etc?

[22:26:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or none unambiguous)
[22:27:18] <ggreer> Obormot\Arcturus: you'd be surprised. there are all kinds of confounding factors. even if you're indoors and blindfolded, you can still sense heat and cold with your skin, and different parts of the room might be hotter/colder (eg: windows). sound bounces around predictably, and that could give you an idea of what direction your'e facing
[22:28:55] <ggreer> hell the ground might not be perfectly level and you might be able to notice that
[22:29:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: Sure, but, like, are there any studies which went: "We took some aboriginal dudes to an open plain on a calm day, blindfolded them, and spun them around; they pointed north unerringly every time. Could they have been sensing some subtle wind or smell or some shit? Perhaps! Give us more funding and we'll narrow that shit down"
[22:29:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know? It's no good saying "there might be subtle confounders" if there isn't even any results that give the supposedly-expected outcome *without* adjusting for those confounders
[22:29:52] <adiabatic> or fly them into a strange city with tall buildings all around with the grid not at NSEW angles and ask them which way is north
[22:30:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well ok that one sounds expensive

[22:30:35] <adiabatic> then I realized north is mountains
[22:31:37] <ggreer> Obormot\Arcturus: the problem is that there's too much crap information. eg: eeg scans "proving" that humans can sense the earth's magnetic field (but there's plenty of other contradictory research showing they can't)
[22:33:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: Well, sure. It's just suspicious if there's no research that just does the *obvious* thing that should (if the phenomenon is real!) give a clear and obvious result
[22:33:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Can humans find magnetic north" is a question that there's no reason to go to an EEG scan to answer - at least, not *first*
[22:34:00] <feep> can *some* people find magnetic north
[22:34:06] <mst> of course they can, the dude who wore a belt with vibrating sensors proved that
[22:34:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> What dude
[22:34:14] <feep> I mean, biologically
[22:34:30] <feep> because it would explain a lot if northsense is genetically variable
[22:34:49] <feep> (in which case I would have zero of it)
[22:34:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: Or, to put it another way, "human brain activity reacts in some subtle way to the Earth's magnetic field" is interesting, but it surely is not the same as "can humans actually literally find magnetic north if they want"
[22:34:55] <mst> I don't remember precisely but there was a biohacker dude who built a belt with eight vibrating thingies where whichever one was oriented towards north vibrated

[22:35:56] <gwern> I had the ankle version of that for a while. it never really 'clicked' for me: I had a vague sense but nothing where I knew with certainty always. I suspected that it had too few motors and I moved around too little to really trigger any sensory plasticity
[22:36:09] <mst> feep: possible, yes
[22:36:12] <feep> ie. providing the guidance signal of "north" let him learn the stuff in nature that's associated with it

[22:44:06] <ggreer> I'd probably have trouble navigating in the southern hemisphere since I'm not familiar with the constellations down there
[22:45:31] <nshepperd2> what i remember is that after a few months he stopped consciously noticing the vibration and sometimes had to check that it was still working. but had an implicit directional sense instead
[22:46:07] <nshepperd2> i can't google this because everything is people trying to sell you a north paw kit or plagiarism of like one wired article
[22:46:18] <kuudes> but yeah, personally I usually manage to keep internal track on my orientation, and get very confused when I lose track of that

[22:46:46] <PapuaHardyNet> Obormot\Arcturus: I agree with your judgement
[22:47:47] <kuudes> I notice relative direction is encoded in finnish cardinal direction names: south = etelä ~ "place of frontside, etu=front", north= pohjoinen "place of bottomside, pohja=bottom"
[22:48:18] <kuudes> I guess it makes sense to face the sun. and southwest seems to be the preferred direction here, the higher value lots are that way

[23:17:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gonna just paste this whole paragraph because it's dead-on:
[23:17:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Design feels like a field where taste is less collaborative and more made – that is, design is an inherently dictatorial field. This goes beyond the typical examples of industrial, UX, visual design, and even things into design as architecture for a system (i.e, Dave Cutler with VMS and NT). I have to wonder is this is the root of the problem. If successful design requires top-down leadership to enact and make sure its
[23:17:26] <Obormot\Arcturus>  vision is consistently executed, it conflicts with how most projects are structured around programmers where collaboration is simply the norm. It’d also explain why many OSS projects find it easier to copy design instead of lead it, and why designers aren’t attracted to OSS projects."

[23:19:25] <pompolic> one of the rabbitholes I've been going down for the past year or so is interaction design, broadly
[23:20:08] <feep> the problem is oss and consistent os design
[23:20:20] <feep> which would necessarily require excluding a lot of software
[23:20:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And that page quotes our favorite cranky Russian one-man indie-OS author)
[23:21:13] <adiabatic> …Russian?
[23:22:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> With a name like "Stanislav", did you think he was Irish? Brazilian? :p
[23:22:54] <adiabatic> he's a literally-who to me
[23:23:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Get outta town
[23:23:16] <pompolic> oh is it the loper os guy?
[23:23:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep

[23:23:28] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : The USGOV should grant $10 Million to open source projects like the Linux Kernel
[23:23:40] <two2thehead> Just make it an annual thing
[23:24:09] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: I have never seen this page
[23:24:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> gasp
[23:24:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's full of truth
[23:24:46] <pompolic> +1
[23:25:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Not pure truth, he has the cognitive bias of being incapable of seeing or admitting when an existing thing made by the existing systems is good in any way)
[23:25:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But a lot of truth. And a very uncommon perspective, which makes it valuable)
[23:25:47] <adiabatic> sounds like ayn rand
[23:26:04] <mst> oh, yes, I really like that blog
[23:26:12] <mst> agree re the bias, but it's damn good
[23:27:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Comment on that Potemkin villages post:
[23:27:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> "it is boring to follow HIGs and standards, I want my applications and software to look the way I want them to look, if I run into any issues, I just drop a bug report on github and fight with the devs 24/7.
[23:27:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, join their discord/IRC/matrix/element group to create even more pointless discussions. Yeah I use Adwaita Penis Theme Fork v1.02 updated on 2017, I want it to look correctly on your software."
[23:28:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://liliputing.com/2015/02/elementary-os-devs-say-youre-cheating-dont-pay-free-software.html lol
[23:28:44] <Robomot> elementary OS devs say you're cheating if you don't pay for free software - Liliputing (elementary OS devs say you're cheating if you don't pay for free software)
[23:29:09] <Betawolf> wow, cheating's awesome.
[23:29:29] <pompolic> not a serious opinion but at this point i can't trust software that doesn't actively fight against me
[23:29:38] <pompolic> hmm, that got lost in translation
[23:29:52] <adiabatic> yeah, try again plz
[23:29:56] <pompolic> but i'm thinking of things like radare2
[23:30:13] <adiabatic> what's that
[23:30:21] <pompolic> reverse engineering framework
[23:30:30] <pompolic> it will eat your project files
[23:30:45] <pompolic> but also it's really powerful if you can navigate the phone tree of commands it has
[23:31:13] <pompolic> also if you git pull in the morning it's "too old" by night
[23:31:36] <pompolic> upside: no designer paternalism
[23:31:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There was one person in the philosophy department who was treated with disdain. He smoked continental cigarettes and wore NHS granny glasses mended with cellotape. His name was Gyorgy and he was a Hungarian in exile. Gyorgy was unpopular because he actually knew something about computers and did not hide the fact, and because he wrote impeccably grammatical English sentences that really required the use of a bracket balancing
[23:31:45] <Obormot\Arcturus>  editor to read them. One famous example was his seminar abstract which consisted of a single sentence of 200 words.
[23:31:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course Gyorgy wrote in Lisp and so I was hooked."
[23:32:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "They were good times and of course they could not last. The government got wind of the fact that we weren't actually producing anything, but enjoying ourselves and put a stop to it. After two years of anarchy with Lisp, in 1988 I was sent to the LFCS in Edinburgh for correctional training in ML. Two years after that I returned to Leeds and gave my talk on ML. The first slide was titled
[23:32:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why is Programming in ML like Safe Sex?
[23:32:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because you can't catch any bugs but it's not much fun."

[23:33:41] <Robomot> Biography
[23:38:06] <ggreer> https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1438751064765906945 noooo
[23:38:08] <|dbotdan> Elon Musk (@elonmusk, 2021-09-17 06:25): ‘Beta button will request permission to assess driving behavior using Tesla insurance calculator. If driving behavior is good for 7 days, beta access will be granted.’
[23:38:46] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao, now your car will decide if you are a good beta or not
[23:40:12] <two2thehead> the alpha driver vs the beta autonomous car?
[23:40:24] <ggreer> https://twitter.com/rice_fry/status/1381016295143972864 those are the metrics used in calculation
[23:40:25] <|dbotdan> Tristan (@rice_fry, 2021-04-10 22:48): ‘* # of Autopilot Strikeouts | * # of Forward Collision Warnings | * # of Lane Departure Warnings | * # of ABS activations (All & User) | * Time spent within 1s of car in front | * Time spent within 3s of car in front | * Acceleration Variance | * Service Mode | * Delivered | (2/2)’
[23:41:24] <ggreer> I get forward collision warnings maybe once a month. it's stupid because it's stuff like a car making a right turn and I know it'll be out of the way so I slow down a little, but not as though the car is stopped in front of me
[23:41:56] <two2thehead> hm
[23:42:14] <two2thehead> would you say that the tesla is training you to be even more cautious in driving?
[23:42:23] <ggreer> no
[23:42:29] <two2thehead> ah
[23:42:31] <ggreer> it's a false positive
[23:42:39] <two2thehead> ggreer, +1 for the quick response
[23:43:00] <ggreer> I wonder if it counts ABS activations in track mode
[23:43:09] <ggreer> ditto for acceleration variance
[23:44:02] <ggreer> I doubt I'll get in because I love to floor it on freeway onramps
[23:45:27] <ggreer> some people get lane departure warnings for giving big trucks space, but I've never had that happen

[23:49:37] <ggreer> it doesn't
[23:51:31] <CoJaBo> All applicants we're getting are creeps lol
[23:51:46] <adiabatic> how can you tell they're creeps, and what's your sample size
[23:52:14] <CoJaBo> So far 4 rejected for being creeps
[23:52:57] <adiabatic> if I remember my Joel on Software blog posts well enough, hiring is basically sifting through a lemons market because most employable people are already employed

[23:53:21] <Robomot> Single-use plastic bags ban to go into effect in October | News | khq.com (Washington's statewide ban on single-use plastic bags goes into effect Oct. 1.)
[23:53:40] <ggreer> CoJaBo: you gotta be more specific than "being creeps"

[23:53:58] <CoJaBo> Creeps is a broad category.
[23:54:03] <rmmh> boulder county banned single-use plastic and all the other groceries in colorado stopped having paper bags because boulder was using them all
[23:54:06] <CoJaBo> We've gotten every type
[23:54:12] <adiabatic> ggreer: eight cents? cheaper than california's 10¢
[23:54:20] <rmmh> (maybe the supply chain has been resolved now)
[23:55:02] <ggreer> single use plastic bags are like... 0% of waste. also you'd have to reuse a bag for years before it broke even with disposable bags
[23:55:30] <rmmh> adiabatic: I treat it as a luxury good. Conspicuosly consume an extra $0.10 when you visit the grocery and bask in the shocked looks from the plebs.
[23:56:00] <CoJaBo> A decent % of the time the bags I get don't make it from the car to the house without breaking lol
[23:56:05] <ggreer> I'm surprised nobody has sold a box of plastic bags at grocery stores. you can buy a bunch of plastic garbage bags at a grocery store. why not slightly smaller thinner ones with handles?
[23:56:08] <adiabatic> I don't bother with my own bags when I buy raw meat because I want the raw meat going into disposable-if-expensive grocery-store bags

[23:56:17] <ggreer> I hate paper bags. they tear so easily. plastic is the best
[23:56:34] <rmmh> you can bake with them
[23:57:14] <adiabatic> TJ's paper bags are OK
[23:58:58] <ggreer> I'm pretty sure the end result of these laws is to create more waste. people don't reuse the heavier duty plastic bags enough to make up for their larger resource requirements
[23:59:06] <ggreer> also reusing bags gets people sick
[23:59:31] <ggreer> IIRC the best estimates are that SF banning plastic bags causes an extra 1-2 deaths a year
[23:59:37] <adiabatic> I reuse the bags as trash-can liners, but I did that just as well with the single-use plastic ones
[23:59:46] <rmmh> it's very important that people take responsibility for global warming and don't look too hard into industrial pollution levels
[23:59:58] <rmmh> adiabatic: they're not very good trash-can liners, though
