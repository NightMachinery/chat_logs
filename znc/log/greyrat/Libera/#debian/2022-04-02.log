[01:58:11] <luki> Alright Ops busshit hits dev hard
[01:58:35] <Khepra> this happened before bullseye was frozen, and it was never returned to testing in time

[02:09:12] <kjetilho> Khepra: hmm, good point - should be possible for sleep(1) to postpone loading all that locale stuff until it was actually needed (which is never in the normal case)

[02:11:09] <karlpinc> I once looked at the code for sleep.  It's C is quite carefully crafted.
[02:11:34] <Khepra> most of it is parsing args, then a xnanosleep call. that's it. that one call is all of its function.
[02:11:51] <luki> karlpinc: I look at this more from a operationial perspaticive. If any partion is filled up to a certian threshold I want to know about it, not if any backup fails on it ... this bug report makes operation issue to one of developers.

[02:25:57] <Khepra> and I also hate that debian doesn't permit return of packages into release, if they were removed because RC wasn't fixed in time for release. you fix it two days later (this bug was returned to testing on the day of bullseye release!), but for the next forever, that package is out of the codenamed release

[02:32:07] <somiaj> Often times the freeze is long enough, that maintainers are given a lot of time and clear dates they must do X to get it into the release. Though yea it can cause issues in certain cases.
[02:32:45] <somiaj> Though, as with every system there are advantages and not disavantages. A part of the release team being a bit more agressive is to not have another freeze that lasted a year.
[02:32:53] <karlpinc> Khepra: I can see where returning packages into a release could be a "people issue".  If you can put off fixing something "without penalty" then people will.  So new releases will be released without many things, which will then gradually trickle in.
[02:33:13] <somiaj> You can also add it to backports once it is fixed and in testing.
[02:34:07] <somiaj> Though there are lots of issues around how maintainers have ownership of packages, more and more teams need to be used, or to allow others to help out if a maintainer goes missing for a while due to their other oblegations.
[02:35:29] <luki> It is how it is, I sill can belive that the one bug report has lead to drop the package from stable. Is this to you guys reasonable or am I alone?

[02:40:10] *** Joins: wonko-the-sane (~wonk-the-@gateway/tor-sasl/wonko-the-sane)
[02:40:17] <sney> I would have called it important, "a bug which has a major effect on the usability of a package, without rendering it completely unusable to everyone." that severity would not have caused it to be removed from testing
[02:41:27] <somiaj> Also took the maintainer about a year to fix the issue. Seems a lot of things got this to cause problems. The maintainer should have also been the one to change the serverity as well IMO.
[02:41:51] <sney> definitely
[02:42:20] <somiaj> luki: note, if you wanted you could make a backport and go though the process to get this into packports so it is avialable to stable users.

[02:54:17] <somiaj> luki: sure, but then the maintainer should have caught it, reduced the servity and made a fix, and they didn't make the well published time line for this. Yes not ideal, but the release team can't wait if maintainers miss certain freeze dates. Not ideal, but at this time it is gone, no need trying to figure out how to fix the past, instead someone could volunteer to do the work to add it to backports
[02:55:48] <Khepra> luki: and until then, if you _really_ want it, it's dead easy to backport from sid. it backports cleanly.
[02:56:17] <Khepra> ,checkbackport autopostgresqlbackup
[02:56:18] <judd> Backporting package autopostgresqlbackup in sid→bullseye/amd64: all build-dependencies satisfied using bullseye.
[02:56:21] <Khepra> !ssb
[02:56:21] <dpkg> First, check for a backport on <debian-backports>.  If unavailable: 1) Add a deb-src line for sid (not a deb line!); ask me about <deb-src sid> 2) enable debian-backports (see <bdo>) 3) apt update; apt install build-essential; apt build-dep packagename 4) apt -b source packagename 5) dpkg -i packagename-ver.deb  To change compilation options, see <package recompile>; for versions newer than sid see <uupdate>.
[02:56:30] <somiaj> also note talking about stuff like this in IRC isn't going to change anything.
[02:56:46] <somiaj> Unless you are just wanting to better understand what happened, vs how to make it not happen for other packages.

[11:33:59] <Khepra> Tangent-Man: it's possible the kernel package is updating through unattended-upgrades, which is default if you installed gnome. it doesn't have effect until you reboot, of course.
[11:34:22] <Khepra> you can check when and what upgraded via /var/log/apt/history.log

[11:52:59] <somiaj> In general you do want to keep up to date on security updates to the kernel, though I don't know the various tools that do this automatically besides unattended-upgrades. Though I thing gnome has its own thing now
[11:53:53] <somiaj> ahh might be packagekit
[11:54:28] <Tangent-Man> I am using KDE .. Yeh it's just a PITA when I have work to do and all of a sudden my VM's don#t work and my WiFi card doesn't work.  I guess thats why some people say turning off secure boot is a thing...
[11:54:44] <somiaj> kde might be using package kit too, common tools for upgrading packages used by des these days

[15:18:22] <badsektor> Khepra, i think this uninstall script worked, i shutdown and restarted with no problems
[15:18:48] <badsektor> you know the small icons of running programs

[15:25:00] <badsektor> so now i got tray icons!
[15:25:13] <Khepra> you need an extension to get them back but iirc it's broken and doesn't upgrade when it should

[15:25:31] <Khepra> oh, is debian modifying gnome to show tray icons?
[15:25:38] <badsektor> see, in buster i didnt have them, they are very important to have though
[15:25:54] <Khepra> I agree they're important. GNOME devs seem to disagree.
[15:26:02] <badsektor> i am not sure, i am using a lot of shell extensions on the taskbar, maybe that has something to do with it
[15:26:12] <badsektor> so you say they are disabled by default
[15:26:41] <Khepra> as far as I know, stock gnome disabled tray icons few releases ago. they're available through (buggy) extensions
[15:26:50] *** Parts: Ark74 (~ark74@ds1.switnet.net) ()
[15:27:26] <Khepra> badsektor: UNLESS... gnome itself has a few of those icons that look like tray but that's gnome shell functions. settings and user profile, volume, stuff like that. do you mean that?
[15:27:48] <Khepra> so the tray icons I'm talking about is they removed the ability for random application to show a tray icon, without that extension
[15:28:22] <badsektor> ok i see now, i already installed "tray icons" extension, but it wasnt working on the previous GNOME i had in buster, now it works
[15:28:55] <badsektor> i see it in my installed shell extensions list

[21:03:04] *** Joins: nickodd (~nickodd@user/nickodd)
[21:03:18] <naptastic> The only reason I'm having a problem is because I was holding it wrong. Really, really wrong.
[21:03:46] <naptastic> (I mounted the filesystem from two hosts simultaneously. Almost no filesystem will survive that intact.)
[21:03:47] <cheapie> I use it for root on desktop-type stuff here, but not yet on servers.
[21:04:00] <laur> i used btrfs on fedora, it has nice features, but ext4 is battle-proven... i tend to get scared when filesystem devs warn one against using their filesystem repair because it could destroy more than it fixes, and you should consult them if things go wrong
[21:04:28] <cheapie> I haven't had normal btrfs eat data in a really long time now - zoned btrfs has, but that's more or less brand new still.
[21:04:44] <naptastic> "zoned"?
[21:04:45] * naptastic googles
[21:05:12] <cheapie> https://zonedstorage.io/docs/linux/fs#btrfs
[21:05:45] <cheapie> The TL;DR is that it's for enterprisey hardware that's obscure enough that the easiest way to get one is to ask WD for a sample :P
[21:06:06] <Khepra> laur: ext4 may be "battle proven" but you can't compare it to btrfs. their designs and functionality patterns are vastly different.
[21:06:15] <naptastic> yeah from reading the description, I am TERRIFIED. That is code that should never have been written.
[21:06:42] <laur> btrfs raid 5 and 6 are also with known bugs and "Avoid unless prepared to lose data". btrfs can only repair corrupt data inr aid configurations, though, i question fedora wisdom of btrfs by default for laptop, which don't have raid 1
[21:06:49] <Khepra> welp, NVME SSDs are zoned too, so it's not just obscure SMR drives
[21:06:56] <cheapie> The only other option for running an FS directly on these devices is f2fs, and f2fs has.... problems, in addition to not supporting large drives.
[21:07:00] <cheapie> Khepra: Only the ZNS ones.
[21:07:17] <Khepra> point being it's not just "obscure" datacenter use cases :)
[21:07:22] <naptastic> "At mount time, btrfs can find the latest version of the super-block by looking at the position of the zone write pointer" So you have computers with perfect memory and zero chance of sudden power loss or crash?
[21:07:30] <cheapie> NVMe ZNS SSDs are obscure datacenter things :P

[21:07:52] <cheapie> (regular NVMe SSDs are not, but they're also not zoned)
[21:07:53] <Khepra> meanwhile, folks please stop responding btrfs with filesystems like ext4 or f2fs. if you don't need CoW functionality, data checksumming, then you likely don't need btrfs to begin with, transparent compression be damned as a sole argument.
[21:08:15] <laur> i think for most people, ext4 is better because of better tooling when things get wrong, and there was a usenix paper about that - ext4 was the winner between ext4, xfs, jfs and btrfs due to its tooling, although the other filesystems have more modern features
[21:08:18] <Khepra> cheapie: nah, I have zoned NVME SSDs is cheap consumer acer aspire 3 laptops :)

[21:09:29] <cheapie> Khepra: Do you have any proof of that? If they were zoned from the factory they would be (among other things) incompatible with Windows.
[21:09:55] <cheapie> naptastic: The write pointer is managed by the drive - you can't read past it even if you want to, so there's not a lot more btrfs could even do there.
[21:11:08] <cheapie> I'm also not aware of any that would even physically *fit* in a laptop, although I see no reason one couldn't exist.
[21:11:11] <naptastic> cheapie: there's not a lot more *any* filesystem could do, given those constraints.

[21:11:21] <naptastic> are they all 2.5"?
[21:11:50] <cheapie> NVMe ZNS SSDs are usually 2.5" 15mm, using one of the various cabling standards (U.2 or whatever) to get PCIe to them.
[21:12:08] <Khepra> cheapie: not at the moment, because those laptops are not with me now, but when we were testing them for purchase, this feature came out
[21:12:37] <cheapie> Khepra: Is it perhaps getting mixed up with multiple namespace support?

[21:17:06] <Khepra> I'll be honest and say this is second-hand info coming from me. Our hw techie who tested the laptops said the nvmes are zoned
[21:17:07] <cheapie> If you somehow *do* find "host-managed" there, let me know what model that SSD is, because I'll probably go find one on eBay to try in that case :P

[21:19:38] <naptastic> None of mine are zoned. No surprises; they're aimed at consumers. I *can* create multiple namespaces on them but it doesn't get me anything, so I don't.
[21:20:18] <cheapie> I only have two zoned devices, both hard drives - a 20TB one that WD sent over, and a 14TB Seagate I found on eBay.
[21:21:28] <cheapie> Three* - I forgot about this 8TB Seagate that I also found on eBay.
[21:21:34] <naptastic> ok now I'm... wtf is the advantage of ZNS on spinning rust, much less flash? Isn't that what partitions or LVM are for?
[21:22:01] <cheapie> The idea is less write amplification (so less wear, higher performance), in practice I don't know how much it actually matters.

[21:25:55] <naptastic> "Please extract this archive into the SMR region and put the filesystem metadata in the non-SMR region, thanks"
[21:26:21] <cheapie> You can use dm-zoned and let *that* manage data placement, you can use an FS with support for it (f2fs or btrfs, at the moment) and let that manage it, or you can choose to not use an FS and instead use software that can use the drive directly.
