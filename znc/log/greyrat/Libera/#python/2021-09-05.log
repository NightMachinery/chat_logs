[02:11:40] <ColonelJ> I'm getting strange answers, maybe I worded the question badly.  I was just wondering if None is Python's equivalent of null
[02:11:40] <InPhase> ColonelJ: "null" generally means "does not refer to anything", but in Python, everything refers to something, and None is one object that is used to refer to a blank value.
[02:12:09] <ChrisWarrick> (Scala has None and null. None is part of the Option type, and null is the usual ugly thing.)

[02:12:29] <InPhase> ColonelJ: That is an appropriate way to think of it.  Just understand None is an object, and you can even call methods it has.
[02:12:36] <nedbat> ColonelJ: i would say, yes, None is the value that other places call null
[02:13:55] <jinsun_> ChrisWarrick: F# too
[02:15:04] <ColonelJ> ok got it, cheers all.  And as I understand None is included in Python's Optional[T]

[13:24:46] <hexnewbie> I wanted to include the Powered by Python logo in my project, and include in my README a) a citation of the trademark usage policy that allows me to do so (I will read it again), and b) something that allows me to copy it, which I suspect the trademark policy already does implicitly, but in the absence of copyright license I was unsure

[13:28:31] <hexnewbie> And that is clear, I was just wondering how wrong Wikimedia Commons is.
[13:29:03] <jinsun> python is cc0? I thought it was a custom permissive license (mainly because it shows up as a separate entry in the fsf list)
[13:29:29] <stealth_> its probably been through few weird licenses
[13:29:48] <hexnewbie> Actually, there's one unclear part of the policy, “These logos should be used in the form provided by the PSF, and should be accompanied by a symbol for unregistered trademarks: "(TM)" or a small TM "™". This may not be removed or obscured and must always be included with the logo.” - but the Python Powered logo in the provided form does not have a ™ symbol

[17:06:50] <Henry151> hey there. i've got an issue where, I'm using sqlalchemy, and i have a variable "md" that is a query. If I look at that with str(md), it has a variable in it like "%(oven_started_1)". I want to run an explain analyze on the query, so i'm building that explain analyze with something like dbSession.execute("EXPLAIN ANALYZE + " md) .. however, that technique doesn't interopolate the %(oven_started_1)
[17:06:56] <Henry151> variable to the correct value, so instead, I ran the "md" query and looked at the postgres logs to see what it winds up being as raw SQL. In those logs, it looks like it is supposed to wind up being "'2021-09-04T01:40:40.813306+00    :00'::timestamptz" -- so, I did something like dm = str(md) % {"oven_started_1" : "'2021-09-04T01:40:40.813306+00    :00'::timestamptz"} ... then I checked with str(dm) and
[17:07:02] <Henry151> confirmed that the relevant part does show as "'2021-09-04T01:40:40.813306+00    :00'::timestamptz" ... now, the problem is, when I try to run dbSession.execute("EXPLAIN ANALYZE " + dm), I get a traceback saying "sqlalchemy.exc.StatementError: (sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError) A value is required for bind parameter '00'" and in that traceback, the relevant part shows as "'2021-09-04T01:40:40.814597+00
[17:07:08] <Henry151>    %(00)s'::timestamptz)" -- can anybody help me figure out where the %(00)s is coming from and how to manually specify it instead of having it as a variable that gets replaced with a value?

[18:29:38] <jinsun> okay so that looks like the xml part inside the docx, so not binary, now you have to figure out why it is not utf-8

[21:27:28] <nedbat> i just downvoted that answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/18635460/14343) I recommend others do the same.
[21:28:08] <maharshipatel> is it possible to solve this in less than O(n^2) ? Write a function solution(l) that takes a list of positive integers l and counts the number of triples of (li, lj, lk) where the list indices meet the requirement i < j < k.  The length of l is between 2 and 2000 inclusive.  The elements of l are between 1 and 999999 inclusive.  The solution fits
[21:28:09] <maharshipatel> within a signed 32-bit integer. Some of the lists are purposely generated without any access codes to throw off spies, so if no triples are found, return 0.

With this timestamp: 2021-09-04T01:40:40.814597+00:00 looking at this documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/datatype-datetime.html I'm trying to understand about the bit at the end after the + sign, the 00:00. If I'm grasping what I'm reading correctly, that's the timezone offset. Since it looks like the offset on this timestamp is 0, represented as 00:00, I would imagine I could
[22:09:34] <Henry151> instead write it as +0, or +00 and it should represent the same data, right?
[22:10:35] <Henry151> the reason  being, the :00 is somehow being interpreted as %(00) when i try to get the str() representation of my postgres query, and it's breaking things, if i'm understanding correctly
[22:11:27] <Henry151> so I'm trying to see if I could get around it by just writing the timestamp slightly differently, so that it doesn't have a colon in it. Though perhaps I'm misunderstanding what's happening here. Any input?

[22:53:11] <cloudbender> There should be no reason not to get the data events into Numpy arrays directly.  Numpy is faster than core arrays.
[22:53:36] <InPhase> pycode: If you need better performance or storage than a list append to gather the data, you can use numpy backed storage filled in with slice operations by either preallocating enough, or storing lists of pre-sized numpy arrays.

[22:54:30] <InPhase> pycode: For example, lists of numpy arrays of a million elements will be almost as fast as numpy gathering into a giant array of infinite size.

[22:56:35] <InPhase> pycode: If on the other hand you have data that is constantly incoming and constantly analyzed, you might want to consider a numpy-backed circular buffer implementation.  Just make sure your preallocated size is big enough to not fill up.  Run some calculations or measurements to figure out what that needs to be, and give a little extra.

[23:04:47] <ColonelJ> for (shallow) cloning a list x would you use list(x) or x[:]
[23:05:36] <deniska> ColonelJ: I err towards x.copy()
[23:06:35] <deniska> ColonelJ: it will work with many types besides lists

[23:30:37] <justoneprimate> Quick questions. When performing a calculation within a function, is it best to return the calculation directly from the return statement, or is it better to create a variable for said calculation and return the variable?
[23:31:52] <jmcantrell> justoneprimate: whatever is the most readable
[23:32:19] <justoneprimate> So there's no hard/fast pythonic rule then, other than readability. Check. Thank you.
[23:32:37] <yitz> Don't do:    `res = ....  ; return res` . That really doesn't add much
[23:33:32] <justoneprimate> @yitz Agreed.
[23:34:06] <justoneprimate> I was working a solution for a simple C to F calculation, and the 'solution' creates a variable, where I didnt feel it was warranted.
