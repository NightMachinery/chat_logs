[22:51:25] <jjido> is there a Julia bot to run code?
[22:55:18] <mikko> what do you mean?
[22:56:18] <jjido> Like "Julia> print("hello")" in IRC
[22:56:32] <jjido> and it outputs hello
[22:56:43] <mikko> oh â€“ i'm sure someone has made one but i don't think we have anything like that here
[22:57:35] <jjido> ok. My version of Julia gave me this answer, I wanted to see if it was fixed:
[22:57:50] <jjido> julia> 2^63
[22:57:50] <jjido> -9223372036854775808
[22:58:51] <mikko> what do you mean fixed?
[22:58:57] <mikko> typemax(Int64)
[23:00:02] <mikko> you can use BigInts or UInt64 if you need such big numbers
[23:00:07] <mikko> eg. BigInt(2) ^ 63
[23:00:10] <jjido> Mmh, did I misunderstand? I thought Julia was auto-upcasting to avoid overflows
[23:00:54] <jjido> 2.0^63 worked
[23:01:13] <mikko> that's a float, you lose some precision with it (look at the last numbers)
[23:01:48] <jjido> I will read about numeric types in Julia. Thanks!
