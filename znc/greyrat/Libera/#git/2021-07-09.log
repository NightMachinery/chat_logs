[13:41:19] <marc-o> Hello, I'm a web developper working on small to medium size projects, alone. I'm trying to decide about wich git workflow to use.
[13:41:27] <marc-o> I thought about this one : three branches : `dev`, `preprod` and `prod`. On my local machine, I'll add features in branches and then merge those in the `dev` branch. Then when enough work is done I'll merge `dev` with `preprod`.
[13:41:37] <marc-o> On the preprod environnemnent (used to show the client what is done and to test if everything's good) a script will deploy code from the `preprod` branch.
[13:41:43] <marc-o> If things needs more work, I'll go back to step 1 and restart working on the `dev` branch.
[13:41:51] <marc-o> Then, when everything's good enough on `preprod`, I'll merge `preprod` on `prod`, and, again, a script will deploy code on the production machine (using the `prod` branch).
[13:41:56] <marc-o> What do you think about it ?

[16:39:16] <faceface> I want to see all the paths of all the files changed in a named commit. `git log --stat` is showing me ' .../some/path...' ... How do I get rid of the '...' part and show the actual path?
[16:42:40] <jodjodjod> Hi! When using gpg to sign tags I still only sign a SHA1 sum, so I would still be vulnerable to a MITM SHA1 attack, right? What is the preferred solution to this? The tag signing message is also signed(right?), so maybe using the SHA256 of the whole repo as signing message?
[16:47:14] <faceface> hah... I just made my terminal really wide and it fixed my issue
[16:47:21] <marc-o> faceface, make your terminal window wider ?
[16:47:38] <marc-o> :)
[16:47:51] <faceface> thanks marc-o
[16:48:45] <canton7> faceface, I suspect piping it through 'cat' might also do the trick?
[16:49:16] <faceface> thanks, the problem was I didn't know it was a truncation symbol. Pretty obvious now I know
[16:50:02] <faceface> since I'm here... I've been developing code that runs on different servers with different paths on each (silly I know).
[16:50:50] <faceface> I just did a bunch of fixes on the main branch, now I want to deploy that on the server in question. Do I 'git checkout mahpaths' then 'git rebase main' ?

[16:51:24] <faceface> or `git merge main` ?
[16:51:55] <canton7> jodjodjod, what's a "MITM SHA1 attack"? It's vulnerable to preimage attack IIRC, but that's still outside what's possible
[16:53:52] <faceface> You apply your own patch plus some noise to make the signature of the old patch match?
[16:55:20] <jodjodjod> canton7: lets say I push to an unsafe git server and an attacker manages to change the code there with the same SHA1 as in my tag.. when my trusted build server checks the tag it still looks valid
[16:56:54] <jodjodjod> obviously at some point a developer would notice, but the code would then already be rolled out automatically by then.. I know its not really practical, but the technical possibility is there
[16:57:46] <canton7> jodjodjod, but you said it's a signed tag? The point of a tag signature is that someone can't change the tag without invalidating the signature
[16:58:44] <canton7> Ah, you said "with the same SHA1 as in my tag!"
[16:58:57] <canton7> That's a preimage attack, and there's currently no known SHA1 preimage attack afaik

SHA256 the whole repository using that checksum in the git tag comment/message would probably be a valid workaround, right?
[17:01:26] <canton7> jodjodjod, a preimage attack is where you have a sha1 hash, and you need to find something which hashes to that sha1 hash
[17:01:43] <canton7> (as opposed to a collision attack, where you "just" need to find any two inputs with the same sha1 hash)

[17:03:09] <canton7> Like, the level of effort someone would have to go to to even attempt it is on the level of nation states, and I'm sure your actual build server is a much weaker target
[17:03:53] <canton7> ... and bear in mind that presumably they have a short amount of time to carry out the attack, between the tag being created and it being deployed. It's not like they can take it away and work on it for a year
[17:03:53] <faceface> I thought sha1 collisons were easy?
[17:04:39] <canton7> *collisions* are possible, but not easy: there was SHAttered in 2017, which took "the equivalent processing power of 6,500 years of single-CPU computations and 110 years of single-GPU computations"
[17:04:54] <canton7> Bear in mind a preimage attack is 2^80 *times* harder than a collision
[17:05:57] <canton7> i.e. 7 * 10^27 years of single-CPU computations, rather than a mere 6500 years, and 10^26 years of single-CPU computations rather than a tiny 110 years
[17:06:03] <canton7> and they probably have a day or 2 to carry this out

[17:13:38] <ikke> jodjodjod: getting colissions with random input is easier then finding a colissions when one of the inputs is fixed
[17:14:53] <canton7> For a class of 23 people, there's a 50% chance that there's some pair of people with the same birthday. But there's only a 6% chance (23/365) that one of them was born on 1st Jan
[17:18:36] <canton7> (finding any pair of people with the same birthday -- any birthday -- is a collision attack. Taking a specific day of the year and finding someone who has that brithday is a preimage attack)

[22:14:04] <armin> Aldineyer: oof. i did that almost 10 years ago or so for some larger software project.
[22:16:33] <armin> Aldineyer: there's a ruby program (svn2git) and probably a bunch of others that let you import your svn history into git, which means that you keep the history of commits basically.
[22:16:56] <Aldineyer> I see, Oof sounds like it wasn't as easy as expected. I'm currently working (as a developer) at a company that has migrated from CVS to SVN in the past, but currently that's used very poorly. Barely tagging things, very seldom branching and zipping things to make a backup. :(

[22:31:10] <bookworm> >keep in mind that pull requests mean bureaucracy.
[22:31:23] <armin> bookworm: i never said it was bad or something, but it simply needs another human to act in order to get your changes into destination.

[22:37:11] <Aldineyer> Having traceable changes is generally a very good thing unless the organization is trying to find someone to blame instead of fixing the root cause (which most often is a bad process).
[22:37:28] <armin> having traceable changes is what git does, not what pull requests do.
[22:38:48] <armin> that's the very idea of version control.
[22:40:26] <Aldineyer> I see. So the lesson here is that pull requests can be problematic. Basically it's a guarantee from a single person that things work as supposed?

[22:53:44] <armin> well in the end what's problematic is that you can't predict what a change you merge into another branch will actually cause in behind. the 4-eyes-principle is a good thing, but that doesn't guarantee your code reviewer understands every part of your change, all its implications and effects, whatever. it's perfectly possible to live without pull requests if you have a team that knows what they're doing. PRs
[22:53:50] <armin> won't magically make communication superfluous, and the reviewer could still just click on "approve" and call it a day, too.

[23:14:52] <Aldineyer> @bookworm: Very true. The one thing I personally have noticed is that I'm much more likely to crate a branch in my local repository to do things like "let's see what happens if I do this fairly large refactoring"

[23:20:59] <armin> still, i sense that PRs create an environment of distrust that can be bad for team performance, and i'd even go as far as to state you might not be doing continuous integration if you're using them.
[23:22:28] <armin> so yup, even if it's a necessary evil, it remains evil.

[23:28:02] <Aldineyer> @armin My knee-jerk reaction is that if you actually have tests that are meant to catch things in the CI/CD pipeline, but those miss. Then it's a problem to be fixed in the tests. Of course this is a gross simplification of the real-world, but an admirable goal, right?
[23:29:49] <mackerman> armin: What do you mean by pull request? PR isn't a thing in git, its all tools and procedure on top, which could be any number of things.
[23:30:30] <armin> mackerman: absolutely correct, it's effectively nothing to do with vanilla git. you hook into the whole process and break the usual way git works.

[23:30:58] <mackerman> git doesn't care, its object storage with diffs.
[23:31:04] <armin> mackerman: i feel that most commercial git servers implement this in some way or the other, so it has become a pretty wide-spread and accepted term.
[23:31:08] <armin> correct.

[23:31:26] <mackerman> If you're going to complain about GitHub or GitLab, say so.
[23:32:11] <armin> that's just 2 git solutions that implement it that happen to be commercial services, but there are privately hosted ones that do it, too (bitbucket, gerrit, gitlab, whatever)
[23:32:45] <armin> i'm not complaining about them, no.
[23:33:36] <Aldineyer> The offficial documentaion has https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull
[23:33:38] <mackerman> Emailing someone to fetch my repo on a private server with just git installed, is also a pull request.  And uses none of those tools.
[23:35:06] <armin> mackerman: absolutely right, yes, i won't argue about the definition of pull requests or tell you how to implement them. all i'm saying is that they might be obstacles.

[23:35:25] <mackerman> Feel free to structure your workflow around something else.
[23:35:37] <armin> that's what i do.
[23:37:18] <armin> you could trivially roll your own thing. in the end you could implement all of that magic with just a server people can ssh into that has git installed and some hooks. add a bit of ~/.ssh/authorized keys command= stanzas to it and you have your super enterprisey sophisticated git solution.
[23:37:39] <Aldineyer> There are a number of possible workflows with git and some fit thing we do at our company (basically structure and processes) better than others.
[23:39:05] <mackerman> I do not think that code and test quality is strongly correlated to whether there is a form called a PR to fill out.

[23:39:59] <armin> mackerman: i agree.
[23:41:14] <Aldineyer> @mackeman What do you mean? What if there's an official stamp to press on the form? But yes, it's a internal communication issue.
[23:43:58] <mackerman> Aldineyer: Only that PRs is some kind of other system to input the change into.  The level of structure and process around it varies by team.
[23:48:05] <Aldineyer> A related question: How would one manage a third party library? Possiblt typing in some sort of information in history.

[23:55:57] <armin> Aldineyer: i don't understand the question to be honest, could you elaborate?
[23:56:33] <armin> Aldineyer: i assume you know about git subtree and submodules and that you mean something more sophisticated?
[23:57:03] <mackerman> For third party libaries, use some package manager or linker to associate the dependency.  git not required.
[23:58:05] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[23:59:49] <Aldineyer> @armin: I'm not familiar with subtree and submodule, but will read up on those. Currently we have code that's not been updated om 12 YEARS in our codebase and it's a very likely source that's hitting displaying text on a LCD.
