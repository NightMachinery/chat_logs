[01:24:57] <roarde> For discussing sh in general, what alternative is there to #sh => #bash ?
[01:25:20] <emanuele6> this is #awk
[01:25:31] <lopid> a posix channel?
[01:25:52] <emanuele6> there are ##workingset and ##posix, but i am not sure why you asked it in #awk
[01:25:59] <emanuele6> since the question is about #sh
[01:26:13] <emanuele6> the channel about POSIX shell scripting is #bash
[01:27:27] <roarde> #bash is not about POSIX scripting. There are several there who will so discuss if asked, but they're *always* beaten to the punch and outscreamed by those who won't so discuss and really have no clue.
[01:27:30] <emanuele6> it is
[01:27:31] <Earnestly> roarde: it is
[01:27:53] <Earnestly> Just specify it
[01:28:30] <Earnestly> Solutions given try to be posix and noted if not (because bash doesn't only exist on linux either)
[01:28:57] <roarde> I do specify. I *never* get solutions not requiring bash when there's a difference.
[01:29:15] <Earnestly> That is, for tooling around the shell, obviously bash features will be proffered over posix sh.  But make note that it is for posix sh and you'll get posix sh
[01:29:35] <roarde> nope. not so.
[01:29:45] <Earnestly> roarde: Do you happen to ask questions when either I'm not around or the channel is full of happy hour clowns (like weekends)
[01:29:49] <emanuele6> roarde: you appeared on my libera.#bash logs today only once
[01:29:54] * Earnestly looks
[01:30:00] <emanuele6> and you never asked a question
[01:30:25] <emanuele6> and i have been idling there almost every day since the creation of the network
[01:30:55] <roarde> Because I learned not to waste my time and the channel's by trying it, emanuele6. The join was to verify the forward was still there. Too lazy to check #sh info manually.
[01:30:56] <emanuele6> ( today, once, 5 minutes ago, joined & left )
[01:30:56] <Earnestly> Hm, I don't have a 'roarde' in my logs at all
[01:31:04] <larryv> it doesn't really matter what roarde thinks of it. there isn't another channel
[01:31:10] <Earnestly> In 153839 log entries
[01:31:35] <Earnestly> Not even in the message, literally doesn't show up at all
[01:31:44] <roarde> Thanks for answering the question, larryv :)
[01:31:46] <larryv> occasionally people ask shell questions in #posix but it's pretty quiet in there
[01:31:51] <Earnestly> Although these logs are new and only go back to 2021-05-19
[01:32:15] <Earnestly> Yeah I don't even bother with #posix
[01:32:30] <larryv> *er, ##posix
[01:32:33] <Earnestly> I even question much of these channels
[01:32:33] <larryv> whatever lol
[01:32:50] <emanuele6> #posix is not even really about shell scripting
[01:33:05] <emanuele6> mainly POSIX C or POSIX in general
[01:33:06] <Earnestly> Seems like pointless dilution, but might be helpful for people who only ever use awk to not have the noise of #bash, I guess
[01:33:19] <roarde> I have noticed that in #awk, when gawk is required, that is stated without being asked. Kudos on that.
[01:33:26] <Earnestly> ##workingset is ideal to me
[01:33:32] <emanuele6> that is also done in bash really
[01:33:49] <Earnestly> #bash ought to be ##workingset for all things shell related
[01:33:53] <Earnestly> (And it basically is)
[01:34:24] <emanuele6> but of course you can't know it because you have never been there, not sure why you assume people don't tell the answer is bash only
[01:34:52] <roarde> Check your freenode logs.
[01:35:05] <emanuele6> this is from earlier today http://0x0.st/oKsi.txt
[01:35:16] <Earnestly> Okay, I went back to logs from 2013 and don't find 'roarde' either
[01:35:22] <emanuele6> roarde: i have freenode logs, so what? people have always been doing that
[01:35:52] <roarde> Earnestly, is it you, or your logs that are wrong?
[01:36:12] <emanuele6> i can't find roarde in my freenode logs either
[01:36:20] <roarde> Your logs are wrong.
[01:36:21] <lopid> perhaps the account roarde was using was actually "xmb"
[01:36:32] <Earnestly> roarde: I only find examples of you in #voidlinux
[01:36:36] * emanuele6 laughs
[01:36:57] <larryv> lopid: it'd be incredible if xmb's whole thing was a shtick
[01:38:06] <Earnestly> roarde: Well this tangent doesn't matter all that much, if you have posix sh questions, #bash is fine
[01:38:21] <Earnestly> If you ever give it a try some day, it might go well

[01:40:18] <Earnestly> I've not even seen the former
[01:43:38] <roarde> Fri Nov  6 07:38:11 UTC 2020 for freenode, btw
[01:44:26] <emanuele6> i don't keep 2 years old logs
[01:45:23] <roarde> It's as far back as mine go. Auto-truncate, but no revisit so it's still there.

[01:49:37] <roarde> That's probably valid, Earnestly. You first said something four hours later. I'm just surprised I was still there to log it.
[01:56:33] <roarde> found your join at 10:35:47
[02:04:50] <Earnestly> Also I don't log join/quit
[02:10:54] <roarde> Perhaps you should temper your assertions.
[02:12:04] <emanuele6> this feels like !b3 #awk edition, lol
[02:12:45] <Earnestly> roarde: I'll remember to never help you
[02:14:57] <roarde> Don't know why that is, but that's entirely up to you, as always.
[02:18:06] <roarde> The base of my query, and the complaint I long ago stopped making, lies with e36freak anyway; not you.
[02:18:47] <roarde> Didn't know that when I asked here. Had I known, wouldn't have brought it up. Bound to be extremely unproductive.
[02:28:59] <mute> e36freak: what did you do to roarde?

[03:54:35] <roarde> nope

[04:07:52] *** Quits: timm (~timm@user/timm) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:11:00] <roarde> #sh forwards to #bash, emanuele6.
[04:11:22] <emanuele6> it does
[04:11:24] <roarde> Kinda eats the namespace.
[04:11:39] <emanuele6> it always has. even on freenode
[04:11:58] <roarde> Yes, I recall.
[04:12:05] <emanuele6> and sh questions are often asked in #bash. you are speaking nonsense
[04:12:54] <roarde> Is #bash *about* sh?
[04:13:56] *** Joins: timm (~timm@user/timm)
[04:15:10] <roarde> Which channel is about sh or portable use of utilites generally? That there's not one (##posix is mostly about discussion of the full standard when anyone shows up) isn't #bash's fault.
[04:15:29] <roarde> Thing is, what could one name such a channel?
[04:15:44] <emanuele6> #bash is about #sh.
[04:16:14] <emanuele6> POSIX sh and POSIX scripting tools and GNU bash are on topic in #bash 
[04:16:32] <roarde> "This is contradiction. Gainsay. I paid for an argument."
[04:16:52] <emanuele6> what you said about #bash is simply not true, any all of us can verify that you never joined #bash before today for a couple seconds
[04:17:05] <emanuele6> s/any //
[04:17:34] <emanuele6> also, again, this is #awk
[04:17:47] <roarde> right, so why does everyone continue this?
[04:18:01] <emanuele6> you mentioned me
[04:18:56] <roarde> You say I did, so I probably did; but you'd have spelled out just how if you wanted me to know.
[04:19:04] <roarde> Not by name.
[04:19:58] <roarde> If you are e36freak, then this subject is over for me. I hold by my earlier statement that it's guaranteed fruitless.
[04:22:40] <roarde> I don't see why my question is any more on-topic in #bash, but there ya go.
[04:24:11] <mute> just curious if you thought e36 was some problem since he kinda runs #bash and #awk it'd be silly to come here to avoid him :)
[04:25:23] <emanuele6> i don't get what roarde is saying he literally mentioned me as "emanuele6": <roarde > #sh forwards to #bash, emanuele6.
[04:25:35] <emanuele6> and no, i am not e36freak :/
[04:26:33] <roarde> mute: As I said, had I recalled before asking my initial question that he was the one who forwarded #sh, I'd have taken care to ask somewhere else.
[04:28:22] <roarde> (figuring out where else to ask is begging the question, tho)
[04:37:33] <e36freak> the fuck did i do?
[04:38:45] <e36freak> oh, the #sh -> #bash forward? yeah i might have done that
[04:39:03] <e36freak> but that's how it's always been on freenode, and #bash has always supported sh when specified
[04:39:11] <roarde> that's it. We won't agree, and you're not going to change it.
[04:39:29] <e36freak> the people in #bash act on their own free will, i can't control what everyone says, but the channel has always been intended to support sh
[04:39:57] <e36freak> i just got here, i don't understand the hostility
[04:39:59] <emanuele6> and it does, roarde has never joined #bash since it exists on libera.chat before today
[04:40:08] <emanuele6> he is just saying that
[04:41:09] <roarde> Just for info, the idea is to have a space to discuss mainly portable use of the command-line. If you can think of a good name for that channel, that'd help.
[04:42:41] *** Joins: seninha (~chatzilla@user/seninha)
[04:45:40] <e36freak> #bash tends toward portable solutions for command line utilities, and if gnu specific or whatever options are given they're generally specified as much. again, i can't speak for everyone in the channel, but i've been active in there for a long time
[04:46:14] <e36freak> and i've never seen someone not get portable/posix help when they ask for it and aren't a dick about it
[04:46:47] <e36freak> emanuele6: iirc i'm the one who grabbed/registered #sh in the move, hence him calling me out
[04:47:45] <roarde> Again, would have avoided it had I known.

[05:06:00] <roarde> It's a hard question to which your answer here is probably correct. I shouldn't expect anything, and don't. Hanging around a bit because it's rude to ask and not wait a while (long while is proper on IRC these days) for any responses.

[15:28:14] <Earnestly> seninha: That xprompt and such are really quite delightful.  It would be nice if the "submenu" context could be generated like pimenu does with $cmd
[15:31:14] <seninha> Earnestly: thanks. I use a shell script to generate input for xprompt and I call it when I press Alt+Space. So instead of xprompt itself fork a process and get its output, it's the caller wrapper script that generates input for it.
[15:32:39] <Earnestly> Yes, however for my immediate case where it might be useful, each 'submenu' would do a lot of unnecessary work (essentially tiny twitch frontend).  Currently it just pipes to new dmenu (bemenu) instance
[15:33:22] <Earnestly> seninha: https://0x0.st/oKo1.sh this is the script with bemenu
[15:33:49] <Earnestly> four giant pipelines, nice and quick
[15:34:30] <Earnestly> If it could produce outputs and those are cached, it'd make for a very nice menu that allows for backtracking
[15:35:30] <Earnestly> seninha: Oh also with pimenu, if -w is used and the submenu opens, moving the mouse will close it.  Perhaps the logic should be to only close the submenu once the mouse leaves only iff the mouse has entered it
[15:36:35] <Earnestly> (Having the menu show up as well before it has read inputs is a nice usability feature, indicating that the menu is "loading", as otherwise nothing would appear to be happening)
[15:38:28] <Earnestly> Hm, xfilter looks like it could replace a tool I have
[15:38:43] <Earnestly> Where I need to maintain checksums in the menu so I can extract them back
[15:40:09] <seninha> indeed, that πmenu behavior is a bug.
[15:41:06] <seninha> Gonna fix that now.
[15:41:22] <Earnestly> In fact, xfilter is something I could have used a lot lol
[15:41:31] <Earnestly> Although it would be nice as a menu (redirect)
[15:43:12] <Earnestly> The xfilter feature of having a third field which is value returned for entry would solve a loads of menu cases
[15:43:22] <Earnestly> Such as displaying title of PDF document, while returning path to it
[15:43:39] <Earnestly> Currently I have to pull out the title, then match it against database to extract associated filename
[15:45:23] <Earnestly> But otherwise these tools, and their code, are what I'd call elegant.  Really quite lovely things
[15:45:58] <seninha> xfilter is an experiment I did to interact with my window manager. It quite does not work as expected in other window manager (I'll fix that later).
[15:46:29] <seninha> Gonna talk in private, to not go offtopic on this channel.

[19:33:45] <f00> is there a way to know inside the an action segment what string the pattern matched? something like this:
[19:33:47] <f00> awk '/(foo|bar)/ { var=foo_OR_bar }'
[19:34:12] <f00> without having to do another ~ inside the {}

[20:07:23] <e36freak> f00: no, but you can use match() with substr(), RSTART, and RLENGTH to extract it
[20:07:29] <e36freak> f00: what are you actually trying to do?
[20:08:29] <f00> extracting years from ebook filenames, storing the filepath in array with index year
[20:09:17] <f00> its already done, was just curious if it was possible another way
