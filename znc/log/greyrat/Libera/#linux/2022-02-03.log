[02:03:43] <TheGuestMovie> from what I've read, Vagrant creates the VMs, but then you gotta follow it up with Ansible/Chef/etc to actually instagll packages and do stuff (they got plugins for that). But those Ansible/Chef steps can be written in the Vagrant file itself. I guess I got 2 things to learn.
[02:03:47] <simbaclaws> terraform could be nice for server deployment automation, and ansible for configuring and setting up any distro, but they're not meant for declaratively making virtual machines
[02:04:11] <simbaclaws> yes, you would complement tools with tools
[02:04:45] <simbaclaws> do you want VM's or cloud instances though?
[02:04:49] <TheGuestMovie> I'm creating various developer environments (desktop distros), it's not for servers
[02:04:57] <simbaclaws> yeah then vagrant is your tool for that

[02:05:23] <simbaclaws> if you want configuration management within the OS itself, a nice choice could be to instead of using ansible or puppet, just use nix

[02:41:54] <Intelo> so your frontend will say for example: I want to execute X command, and sends that off to a server somewhere, then that server has to interpret the API call and execute said command in X language, and return a response in some format right?

[02:48:08] <SaltHillStroller> EdFletcher: Other than building up a message queue
[02:48:12] <EdFletcher> SaltHillStroller: huh? it's an abstract model, an actor could be a thread or a local microservice or a macroservice running halfway around the world
[02:48:22] <uwharrie> it doesn't matter what language you wrap around it, the only consistency to the POSIX command line interface is "a stream of bytes"
[02:48:23] <simbaclaws> I don't get why you would want to write something that executes commands on a server and outputs it back to the frontend, wouldn't it be better to execute said command in language X rather then invoke some sort of shell?
[02:48:30] <akoana> Intelo: stdin/stdout are file descriptors not protocols
[02:48:45] <SaltHillStroller> ayecee: That's what I was curious about. But given that it would end up being a binary semaphore ... what's the point :D
[02:48:48] <polar_bear> that worked better than expected, hodapp. It let me fill out all but 3 fields.
[02:48:52] <EdFletcher> SaltHillStroller: point is it's a "share-nothing" concurrency model: you send messages to other actors that then do work as necessary on them. you share no data and therefore need no syncronization.

[02:49:23] <hodapp> shared-nothing concurrency does solve a lot of problems

[02:49:45] <EdFletcher> hodapp: it really does, it's lovely
[02:50:13] <hodapp> EdFletcher: I remember the ZeroMQ documentation being pretty lovely on this too
[02:50:15] <EdFletcher> some languages helpfully force the actor model on you, like elixir. love it.
[02:50:34] <simbaclaws> each language has high level sys calls towards whatever you want to accomplish, why do you want to capture stdout and send it back from a invoked shell?

[02:53:42] <simbaclaws> gparted does wonders :P
[02:53:46] <EdFletcher> hodapp: no surprise though honestly i think most could pick it up easily and with great success just because BEAM and OTP are so incredible. erlang has decades of "seven nines" uptime and what not, it's absolutely solid. and the functional paradigm, once you grok it, makes the coding very ergonomic. i ported a daemon from Go to Elixir and it was
[02:53:46] <EdFletcher> 50% _less_ code (in total lines)!
[02:54:03] <uwharrie> not, there is no such interface for the level you want to interact with these things at. the CLI was intended for human interaction first and foremost. Some commands had optional machine friendly outputs, but they're neither consistently implemented nor mandatory

[03:20:37] <simbaclaws>               This file gives read/write access to the kernel variable panic_timeout.  If this is zero, the kernel will loop on a panic; if nonzero, it indicates that the
[03:20:39] <simbaclaws>               kernel should autoreboot after this number of seconds.  When you use the software watchdog device driver, the recommended setting is 60.

[08:59:35] <donax> And Debian put "alternatives" in /etc. I don't know why that became an emotional issue for me! So I moved /etc/alternatives to /alternatives or /usr/alternatives and made a symlink to /etc - that way you can easily look at config-file changes (searching with fx find) when you want to debug some package's installation.

[10:55:11] <OnkelTem> labrador: so basically to reason for the reboot is as simple as: we can't get user added to the group without restarting linux in 2022
[10:55:16] <OnkelTem> the reason*
[10:55:21] <yippeeka1> I was technical for my cybersecurity program. But I'm not technical among technical people
[10:55:22] <OnkelTem> (that was a correction labrador)
[10:55:32] <rouji> group membership changes usually don't need a reboot

[10:55:45] <rouji> just a new login or service restart
[10:55:49] <masoudd> OnkelTem, just logout and login as that user
[10:55:51] <OnkelTem> rouji: groups command don't print that I'm in that group, you see
[10:55:51] <yippeeka1> Isn't the point of Linux that you don't have to reboot. Or one of the points,anyway

[13:15:44] <Sauvin> In a way, I'd think python would be a better language to use for learning because there isn't much that C can do that Python can't, but learning can be faster in python precisely because there's no compile/assemble/link part of the learing cycle. It's mostly just write, save, run, "@#$@#%", edit, save, run, "%#^$#@%$", edit, save, run again.

[19:28:52] *** Joins: Veriwind (veriwind@user/veriwind)
[19:28:53] <Dagmar> If your watchdog is actual hardware that operates independently from the rest of the system, the only thing that keeps it from taking action is it being told by the kernel "everything's okay" every few minutes

[19:29:16] <wyre> because ... how the hardware watchdog will know if the software is frozen?
[19:29:29] <Dagmar> It doesn't.  It never does.  That's not how those work.
[19:29:46] <Dagmar> What it will know is that no software has told it not to reboot the whole system in the last n minutes.
[19:29:48] <wyre> Dagmar, sure, but how the kernel pet this hardware watchdog?
[19:29:53] <wyre> is there some specific module?

[20:00:37] <leftyfb> mannequin: maybe clarify that you're running the -lowlatency kernel for no valid reason, refuse to troubleshoot the latest HWE kernel and have gone ahead and manually deleted the HWE kernel files from /boot when we told you not to
[20:00:43] <peetaur> usually you can get some output..like with a serial console; and they usually blame stuff like gpu, or some weird driver you added (eg. relatek wifi is awful this way); and if not, it can often be fixed by mobo firmware update

[21:50:36] <jro1> So I have many folders owned by groups. Members of those groups create files and those files are not automatically assigned group ownership and it causes issues with people trying to make changes to the files

[21:50:46] <labrador> I should read up on that
[21:50:55] <uwharrie> if you need to chown a bunch of files on every boot, you've broken your system badly
[21:50:59] <neshpion> jro1: permissions often look like 700 or 655 etc.; this is a digit in octal, where each digit represents 3 bits, where each 3-bit group represents the permissions: [executable, writable, readable] and the groups are in the order of: owner, group, anybody.  so 777 = [1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1] meaning 1)owner can execute,write,read; 2)group can execute,write,read; 3)anybody can execute,write,read;
[21:51:01] <neshpion> something like 750 = [1,1,1][1,0,1][0,0,0] = 1)owner can execute,write,read; 2)group can execute,read; 1)anybody else can f** off

[21:56:05] <rascul> birkoff xinitrc is just a shell script, you can do anything you want, but some things just don't make sense in that context

[21:56:55] <tirnanog> jro1: it helps to have a goal in mind. for example: "I want for all members of a given group to be able to write to files, regardless of whomsoever in the group originally created them".
[21:56:59] <tirnanog> jro1: (that's a pretty common one)
[21:57:11] <jro1> that's exactly what I'm trying to achieve
[21:57:16] <birkoff> i.e. I can't launch two different WMs on the same X "tty" at different monitors ?
