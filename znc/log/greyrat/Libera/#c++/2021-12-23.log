[03:50:20] <Kit> hi, im making a library, and i have a question: i want the class to be modular in the sense that it has a "base" and by including different files and linking to other things you can add things to the class for extra functionality
[03:50:40] <Kit> and i was wondering how id do that
[03:50:42] <john99> is called inheritance
[03:50:50] <john99> its*
[03:53:46] <Kit> hmm after looking it up a bit idt thats realli what i want, you see, it seems to create a new class, and i was wondering if it was possible to just use the existing class?
[03:54:05] <Kit> i tried doing prototypes for the diffeeent things in the class def
[03:54:52] <Kit> but the arguments of some of the functions require headers for typedefs that the user may not have installed
[03:55:02] *** Quits: vicfred (~vicfred@user/vicfred) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:55:39] <Kit> in my example i have a "module" that allows me to export some data of the class
[03:55:57] <Kit> however the module requires sqlite headers
[03:56:30] <Kit> and in tge class def
[03:56:38] *** Quits: badone (~badone@209.132.189.152) (Quit: ZNC 1.7.5 - https://znc.in)
[03:56:56] <Kit> i have `int Save (sqlite3* db)`
[03:57:21] <Kit> however sqlite3 is defined in sqlite3.h which the user may not have installed
[03:57:42] <vdamewood> That's called a ttansitive dependency. Your users will need sqlite3 anyway.
[03:57:46] <Kit> and if theyre not gonna use the Save function anyway why should they install it
[03:58:18] <Kit> but the function is defined in another completely optional object file to link against
[04:00:14] <vdamewood> So, you're planing on supporting static liking only?
[04:00:21] <vdamewood> linking*
[04:00:40] <Kit> no?
[04:01:05] <Kit> the user might not even have the stuff for the optional module
[04:01:11] <vdamewood> Then you'll just have to separate that code out into it's own library.
[04:01:17] <Kit> oh
[04:01:17] <vdamewood> its*
[04:01:19] <Kit> okay
[04:01:43] <Kit> and i can have the user pass the class they want to save as am argument, right
[04:01:51] <Kit> or is there another way
[04:02:30] <Kit> bc id like to be able to do game.Save but if i have to do Save(&game) thats fine ig
[04:02:54] <vdamewood> Well, no. You'd need a unique implementation of save for every class you plan on being able to save.
[04:03:19] <Kit> theres only 1 class i want to save
[04:03:58] <vdamewood> Well, 'pass the class they want to save' seems to imply that there would be more than one.
[04:05:00] <Kit> ah i see where the confusion came from
[04:05:13] <Kit> no by that i meant which instance of the class they want to save
[04:05:25] <vdamewood> Then say object, not class.
[04:05:35] <Kit> oh right
[04:06:08] <Kit> im just coming from C to C++ so im a noob :P
[04:06:13] <vdamewood> Anyway, if you want to have an optional function like that, it can't be a member function, then.
[04:06:46] <vdamewood> Because all member functions would have to be in the class definition.
[04:07:45] <Kit> okay

[11:03:52] <shugo> if ` int (*p)[3]; int b[3] = {6, 1, 9}; p = &b; ` wants me to **p to get the value of b[0], why so ?
[11:04:14] <shugo> also i cannot initialize p = b even though writing only b is supposed to give address of of the first element right, why is it necessary to write p = &b
[11:04:38] <shugo> asking this again cause the last one went so back i can't find it
[11:05:21] <RandomReader> here's a repeat of my response then:
[11:05:48] <RandomReader> shugo - different types, combined with the way the language handles bare arrays
[11:05:54] <RandomReader> the variable b has type int[3], array-of-3-ints .. however the expression "b" can be implicitly converted into a pointer to the first element, type int*
[11:06:05] <RandomReader> that conversion is actually what happens for indexing, in the expression "b[0]": first it is converted into a pointer to the first element, int*, and then the index operator is applied to that pointer
[11:06:13] <RandomReader> (subscript operator, I should say)
[11:06:25] <RandomReader> the expression "&b" on the other hand is asking for the location of b, which has an array type .. therefore the type of that location is a pointer-to-array-3, which is int(*)[3]
[11:06:34] <RandomReader> so the implicit conversion of the the expression "b" is a pointer to the first element, but the result of the expression "&b" is a pointer to the array itself
[11:06:51] <RandomReader> that's why p is declared the way it is (pointer-to-array-of-3-int), and also why you can apply operator * twice to get the first element
[11:07:08] <RandomReader> the expression "*p" reaches the object array-of-int-3 .. that result can implicitly convert it to a pointer to the first element, int*, so applying operator* to it reaches the first element itself
[11:07:32] <RandomReader> the expression "*b" would also work .. as would "(*p)[0]"
[11:07:48] <RandomReader> { int (*p)[3]; int b[3] = {6, 1, 9}; p = &b; cout << TYPE_DESC(b), TYPE_DESC(p), TYPE_DESC(*p); }
[11:07:49] <geordi> lvalue array of 3 integers, lvalue pointer to an array of 3 integers, lvalue array of 3 integers
[11:08:03] <RandomReader> all of that is worth knowing since you'll encounter it anyway, but in code I write, I prefer to use the library type std::array instead, because it behaves more like any other value type without the weird implicit pointer conversions
[11:08:11] <RandomReader> std::array<int, 3> foo;    "foo" is that array object, not a pointer .. "foo[0]" gets me the first element .. "&foo" is a pointer to the entire array, or std::array<int, 3>*
[11:08:28] <RandomReader> (done repeating)

[20:27:23] <CarloWood> All source files should end with a newline yes. But not because of the language I thought. Perhaps, in C, you can get something unexpected with includes though - I never tried. My files always end on a newline.

[20:32:18] <CarloWood> What is missing in C++ is a life-time hierarchy.
[20:33:02] <InPhase> CarloWood: Private constructors with friends can do it.
[20:34:31] <CarloWood> Unfortunately, the class they are a member of is derived from a class that I control... So, I should have said: class Xyz should only be allowed to be a member of classes derived from Foo.
[20:35:29] <CarloWood> As a result, the life-time of the base class is always longer than that of associated Xyz objects.
[20:35:36] <CarloWood> which is what I need
[20:36:54] <CarloWood> Perhaps a dirty trick with the Badge class... Lemme try something on wandbox.

[21:04:37] <Alipha> CarloWood: i wrote this before looking at your link, but what about having the only valid constructor of Xyz to be `Xyz(const Foo*);` ? then at least you'll deter some usage and/or confuse people enough to look at the documentation :-)
[21:05:56] <CarloWood> I started to adopt this Badge trick: https://awesomekling.github.io/Serenity-C++-patterns-The-Badge
[21:06:33] <CarloWood> The neat thing is that as soon as you see "private blah blah Badge<whatever>" you have to pass a {} (which looks like a badge).
[21:07:09] <PJBoy> finally, a design pattern for control freaks
[21:07:19] <CarloWood> What I just wrote however can't infer the template type of
[21:07:22] <CarloWood> template<typename D,typename std::enable_if<std::is_base_of_v<T, D>, int>::type = 0>
[21:07:22] <CarloWood>   Badge(Badge<D>) { }
[21:07:35] <CarloWood> So, I have to call explicitly:
[21:07:44] <CarloWood>   Derived(int n) : m_foo(Badge<Derived>{}, n) { }

[21:07:52] <CarloWood>   Derived(int n) : m_foo({}, n) { }
[21:07:53] <CarloWood> :(
[21:08:20] <CarloWood> Otherwise it would be a good solution - it totally enforces exactly what I need, which no way around it.
[21:09:34] <CarloWood> PJBoy: I should rename it QRcode, or GreenPass maybe- instead of Badge.

[22:03:35] <RandomReader> overall this sounds like entirely the wrong allocation of responsibilities .. a type is logically self-contained, it expresses specific behavior, and everything else is down to programmer usage
[22:03:59] <RandomReader> there shouldn't *be* complex inter-dependencies between types that absolutely require one to be a member of another
[22:04:23] <RandomReader> that's an external usage choice, not a type characteristic
[22:08:02] <RandomReader> if an external thing wants a T object to be in a place for a certain period of time, it can just put it there .. that's no concern of the T

[22:52:43] <RandomReader> sure, you can use that to customize storage for the class, when the caller chooses to use that interface
[22:53:15] <RandomReader> but it's still caller's choice
[22:54:54] <RandomReader> e.g. the stdlib containers won't normally use it, because the standard allocator doesn't
