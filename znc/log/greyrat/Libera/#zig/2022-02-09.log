[08:56:46] <cr1901> marler8997_: FWIW, I am able to reproduce an AccessDenied error on my machine right now: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/8362#issuecomment-1000059929
[08:57:14] <cr1901> interestingly, it only seems to happen when I run "zig build"; "zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-windows-gnu" works fine
[08:58:13] <marler8997_> cr1901 ah that's great, maybe we could look into it further
[08:59:43] <cr1901> It's bizarre for sure
[09:01:51] <marler8997_> the second zig build may have just happened to work because it doesn't happen every time apparently
[09:02:08] <marler8997_> my guess is if you clean your global cache it might start happening again
[09:02:22] <cr1901> Well, "zig build" consistently fails; "zig build -Dtarget=..." is consistently succeeding
[09:02:40] <marler8997_> oh interesting, so then what about "target=native-windows-gnu"?
[09:03:00] <cr1901> Oh damn, the error went away :(
[09:03:11] <marler8997_> try cleaning global cache
[09:03:53] <cr1901> Where is that on Windows? AppData?
[09:04:03] <marler8997_> "zig env" should tell you
[09:04:24] <marler8997_> %appdata%\..\local\zig I think
[09:05:06] <cr1901> So you think if I _clear_ the global cache, the error will come back
[09:05:16] <marler8997_> that's my guess
[09:05:39] <cr1901> Bye bye cache
[09:06:04] <cr1901> No, error didn't come back
[09:06:09] <cr1901> must be a race of some sort
[09:06:17] <marler8997_> maybe clear local cache to (in zig-cache)
[09:06:27] <cr1901> Did that earlier to no effect
[09:06:55] <marler8997_> yeah I think it's pretty clearly a race condition, see if you can try cleaning everything and retrying and see if it comes back
[09:08:01] <cr1901> Hmmm, nothing... ahhh well, I'll keep that in mind that "it happens sometimes"
[09:08:08] <cr1901> I can't debug a bug that's not there :(
[09:08:29] <marler8997_> yeah, not being able to reproduce makes it a real bugger to fix :(
[09:12:27] <cr1901> Ahhh here we go, now it's back for two of the three targets I tested. I'm about saturated w/ dealing w/ bugs this week.
[09:12:45] <cr1901> http://gopher.wdj-consulting.com:70/paste/4de03466-91da-4102-b0bb-3cc0b93dd6da.txt
[09:15:50] <cr1901> Is there a way to make zig print out a debug log or something more informative than "AccessDenied"?

[09:22:44] <marler8997_> then it will give you an "error trace"
[09:23:20] <cr1901> Debug binaries do not appear to be offered for download :(
[09:23:28] <cr1901> I guess I'll work around this for now

[21:16:22] <andrewrk> marler8997_, yes zig build is completely single-threaded (for now)
[21:18:20] <marler8997_> hmm, any ideas on if something could be holding a handle to the tmp directory? or a subprocess that used it as it's CWD?

[22:03:39] <freshcoffee> hmm ok I looked closer. the `continue :start_over` is _after_ a `dir.close()` so WILD GOOSE CHASE.
[22:06:15] <freshcoffee> maybe trap the error, put proc to sleep, and then examine all open files in the proc

[22:15:46] <marler8997_> andrewrk yes, zig-cache/tmp being renamed to zig-cache/o (although I think this same issue happens in global cache as well)

[22:19:21] <andrewrk> to be clear it's a file inside those dirs; the tmp dir itself won't get renamed
[22:20:13] <marler8997_> I think it's the directory
[22:20:36] <andrewrk> I'm just saying we don't rename "tmp" we rename "tmp/foobar"

[22:21:21] <marler8997_> A subdirectory in zig-cache/tmp/A_HEX_STRING  being renamed to zig-cache/o/A_HEX_STRING
[22:21:38] <andrewrk> is it getting access denied because the destination already exists?
[22:22:00] <marler8997_> doesn't look like it, ReplaceIfExists is set to true
[22:22:19] *** Quits: pkap (~pkap@185.209.196.164) (Quit: Client closed)
[22:22:21] <andrewrk> does that work for directories though?
[22:22:25] <marler8997_> note that it tends to work if "zig build" is invoked subsequent times, so looks like a race condition
[22:22:28] <andrewrk> I don't think you can replace a directory with a directory
[22:22:35] <marler8997_> it may not work
[22:22:55] *** Joins: pkap (~pkap@185.209.196.164)
[22:22:58] <andrewrk> there is a file locking mechanism that is supposed to protect such races. the rename is only supposed to be done while holding an exclusive lock
[22:23:23] <marler8997_> is it possible anything could have a handle to the source directory or a file inside it?
[22:23:27] <marler8997_> that would cause an access denied
[22:23:46] <marler8997_> it's also possible that a subprocess is still being cleaned up and still has a handle open to it (causing the race condtion)
[22:25:08] *** Parts: Andreas71 (~Andreas71@adsl-81.109.242.234.tellas.gr) ()
[22:25:40] <andrewrk> if that is happening it's a bug; the intent of the code is to not do that
[22:25:43] <marler8997_> knowing that the next invocation of zig build will probably work, does that help rule anything out?  Would zig clean up that directory if this type of failure occurred?

[22:26:47] <marler8997_> I was referring to a windows bug, where a subprocess exiting doesn't necessarily mean the kernel has cleaned up all it's handles
[22:27:22] <marler8997_> i.e. https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120329-00/?p=7973
[22:27:56] <andrewrk> oh, well if we wait for a process to exit and its resources are not cleaned up yet that could certainly be an issue
[22:28:43] <marler8997_> yeah I'm not certain this happens, but I've seen things that indicate this might happen on windows (at least that was our best explanation as to what was going wrong), but since this type of thing is so racy it's hard to know for sure
[22:29:28] <marler8997_> that article does say if you wait on the process handle for termination complete, it should be done so maybe Windows doesn't do this

[22:34:21] <Andy71> Hi everyone, new to zig here and I have a question. Is there a way to have custom debug code (other than std.debug.assert) that is compiled/executed only in the safe build modes (Debug, ReleaseSafe)?
