[16:28:51] <stevelitt> html
[19:36:00] <DPA> Can someone please tell me how to properly start an XHTML5 document? I just want to to use a regular, simple, XML serializer, and not have to worry about HTML / SGML shenanigans. I need the browser to respect things like <div/> which are valid XML, but can't occur in plain HTML.

[23:19:32] <DPA> XHTML5 is mentioned on wikipedia and there are validators out there. So, I guess I'll just pretend it's a thing, then. If I put <?xml ?> and the xmlns stuff & the mime & meta tags there, I hope browsers will interpret it like the good old XHTML1, and deal with new HTML5 stuff anyway. I don't have time to deal with the inconsistent HTML nonsense right now.
[23:21:53] <Pilum> Lol
[23:22:38] <lilmonkey``> DPA, HTML isn't inconsistent. The modern HTML spec and implementations are very consistent and there is really no reason to cling to outdated XHTML.
[23:29:35] <DPA> XML is very simple to serialize. <x></x> and <x/> are always the same. But in HTML, I have to know if that tag is self closing or not. That's very inconsistent, and unnecessarily complicates things. Having that inconsistency cleanly specified doesn't change that it's inconsistent either.
[23:29:35] <DPA> There is also that bs. of which tags are allowed in which other tags, but I can deal with that without the serializer having to know that.
[23:29:56] <lilmonkey``> Bruh
[23:30:39] * Pilum rolls his eyes.
[23:30:40] <lilmonkey``> You're allowed to close self-closing elements with `/>` in the HTML serialisation too, and which elements are allowed to be enclosed in others doesn't change between HTML and XHTML.
[23:30:59] <lilmonkey``> In fact, you can write documents that are both valid HTML and XHTML.
[23:31:07] <lilmonkey``> (aka polyglot documents)
[23:32:22] <lilmonkey``> Modern HTML is a single specification with two serialisations. The only difference is the media type, and the fact that the HTML serialisation allows for slightly simpler syntax in some cases. Everything else is the same.
[23:35:24] *** Joins: akaWolf (~akaWolf@akawolf.org)
[23:36:15] <DPA> No, it is not. <div/> is invalid. <img></img> is invalid. In true XML, it wouldn't matter which way it is represented. But in HTML, it does. So no, HTML serialization isn't nearly as simple as XML serialization. 
[23:37:47] <lilmonkey``> Your conflating syntax with vocabulary. XHTML is still HTML, not your own made-up XML-based language.
[23:38:45] <lilmonkey``> So naturally, if you're going to be producting HTML or XHTML, you'll need to know the rules of HTML/XHTML, not just XML (or, in the past, SGML).
[23:40:59] <DPA> In HTML, the serializer needs to know if the element is self closing. In XML, and by extension XHTML, the serializer does not need to know (and neither noes the deserializer). I still can not put an element in an <img/>, but my serializer doesn't need to know that.
[23:40:59] <DPA> Preventing tags from appearing in an <img/> is much easier to deal with a layer above the serializer. In the data to be serialized, it can be coded so it won't occur. that'll happen naturally, even. So it's much simpler overall, for everyone.
[23:41:44] <lilmonkey``> Reality shows that you're wrong.
[23:41:55] <lilmonkey``> Get a better toolchain.
[23:43:42] <lilmonkey``> You're stuck in old ways. That's fine, but until you admit that and become willing to adapt, you're gonna just run into issues and complain on IRC.
[23:44:16] <lilmonkey``> No one here shares your burden because it's imagined.
[23:47:59] <DPA> I can use toolchains, but they also always come with new problems. I may use them if they come with the standard library of whatever language I currently use, but even some of those can sometimes just have unreconcilable issues. That HTML5 has no DTD and new tags are added from time to time certainly doesn't help matters either.
[23:47:59] <DPA> The W3C should just get their shit together and say if it starts with <?xml, it's to be parsed as XML.
[23:49:58] <lilmonkey``> The W3C has nothing to do with this. Modern HTML is governed by the WHATWG. Has been for over 10 years.
[23:50:37] <lilmonkey``> And what so hard about setting the correct media type instead?
[23:52:30] <DPA> That's what I'm doing now, but it's technically not going to be valid XML. Because there is no official xml schema covering all of HTML5. Not sure if there can be, though, given the arbitrary data-* attributes and the existence of <*-*> elements.
[23:52:50] <DPA> (custom elements)
[23:53:11] <DPA> It's all absolutely f'd up.
[23:54:54] <lilmonkey``> DTDs were a terrible idea. Good riddance.
[23:55:26] <lilmonkey``> Anyway, it's clear that you prefer remianing stuck in the nineties. Enjoy :)
[23:55:33] <lilmonkey``> remaining*
[23:56:54] <DPA> I think next year, when I'm hopefully done with my current stuff, I'll just make my own web.
[23:57:01] <DPA> Then I can fix it all.
