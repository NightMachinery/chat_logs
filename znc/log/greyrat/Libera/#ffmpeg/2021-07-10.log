[00:29:37] <BtbN> And again, there won't ever be an example for every single possible usecase
[00:29:44] <BtbN> you got to learn how the API works and use it
[00:29:50] <Terrence> I know that but at least something to reference
[00:30:00] <BtbN> The official examples seem a good reference to me
[00:30:04] <BtbN> and ffmpeg.c itself
[00:31:52] <Terrence> Okay, where I'm running into trouble is creating the encoder for my audio file. Whenever I try to use av_frame_get_buffer() on a frame, I get an error message saying "Could not allocate audio data buffers" even though I've already assigned the frame's number of samples, format, and channel layout
[00:32:14] <Terrence> It 's confusing to me because apparently if I'm unable to do this I cannot send the frame to the encoder
[00:33:26] <Terrence> I'm trying to create a new audio file after running a filter on it, but the new audio file must only contain segments that were not marked by the filter
[00:33:26] <BtbN> Why are you calling av_frame_get_buffer if you already got a frame?
[00:33:49] <Terrence> Don't you have to do that before using encode?
[00:34:02] <BtbN> Have you read the docs on it?
[00:34:38] <BtbN> It's literally the function you call when allocating a new frame.

[02:36:29] <blerd> This concat filter is still kicking my butt.. There has to be something special you have to do for multifile inputs. Then again the final file is messed up even before I pass in the second files frames. File seems right but duration is 85 hours 39 mins and 53 seconds and all the timing is off. and the second file frames are missing. Remove concat and it it works. I guess maybe go back off ffmpeg.c see if I missed something.

[05:31:58] <crashmatrix> silly question perhaps, but does anyone know if it's possible to read a file using directshow filters to decode it?
[05:33:36] <crashmatrix> as far as i can tell there's only ever been one decoder for it, and sadly, it's a ds filter
[05:34:11] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[05:46:40] <blerd> It is possible with one of the directshow filter plugins for avisynth.. but that adds lots of overhead... One of the reason why I had to API. x.x

[06:03:44] <crashmatrix> Doesn't seem like ffmpeg likes avisynth as an input on my system, even the trivial "Version()" script breaks at the moment, might be some x64/x32 shenanigans
[06:14:09] <crashmatrix> Yeah, 64/32 bit incompatibility. Still no panacea though, avisynth+ 3.7 doesn't like my file anymore =_=

[06:25:27] <crashmatrix> Cryo Interactive's HNM6, used in a whole bunch of games from the late 90s/early 00s. It's some frankensteinian half-JPEG half-homebrew codec they (ab)used for cutscenes and the "Omnivision" 3D scenery
[06:26:02] <kepstin> would be cool if you can provide some samples tho, if it is jpeg derived and you have some reference decodes, it might be possible for someone to make a native ffmpeg decoder
[06:26:12] <kepstin> there's already a bunch of other weird 90s game video codecs in ffmpeg :)
[06:27:02] <furq> it's already documented at least
[06:27:03] <furq> https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/HNM6
[06:27:19] <crashmatrix> I got this codec working using gmfcore.ax, an abandoned project by valery anisimovsky
[06:27:49] <crashmatrix> that's the same guy furq, he's been rather prolific with supporting obscure game related codecs
[06:28:16] <crashmatrix> https://github.com/ValeryAnisimovsky/GameMediaFormatsCoreFilters/blob/master/README
[06:29:05] <crashmatrix> i'm not by any stretch of the imagination good enough a coder to attempt fixing a native decoder for ffmpeg, but the source is up for the willing
[06:29:35] <kepstin> oh, GPL2 even (would be nice to clarify if that's GPL2-only or "GPL2 or later")
[06:29:35] <crashmatrix> although this particular codec might be a gotcha since it relies on a few DLLs salvaged from one of the games that uses it
[06:30:23] <kepstin> ah, well, that's not useful then except as a reference decoder for testing :/
[06:31:01] <kepstin> (license headers in some files say GPL2+, so that's probably safe to assume is the case for all the original code)
[06:32:12] <kepstin> yep, the HNM video decompressor just loads a dll and wraps it :/
[06:32:15] <furq> there's an hnm4 decoder already in ffmpeg but the format doesn't look very similar
[06:32:17] <crashmatrix> i once fancied getting to know codec development up close, i kind of went another way as a developer, but I might take a stab at it some day
[06:32:52] <kepstin> looks like given the reverse engineering docs and framework available in ffmpeg already, this wouldn't be that hard of a case.
[06:33:02] <kepstin> figuring out the bitexact jpeg decoding might be annoying tho
[06:33:14] <kepstin> (if that even matters)
[06:33:33] <crashmatrix> this particular game has kept my attention for... at least 17 years, since I found an old forum post about VQA decoding on the XCC site that I wrote about this specific project, to my own surprise

[15:58:11] <hendry> Is there a way to stream my Linux desktop (-device /dev/dri/card0 -f kmsgrab) to another ffmpeg to establish as a video source? Something like NDI?

[16:03:13] *** Joins: linjie (~linjie@58.247.210.251)
[16:05:13] <hendry> BtbN: sorry, to another machine
[16:05:45] <BtbN> Could setup an rtmp server, or use one of the various other streaming protocols
[16:06:21] <hendry> BtbN: it can't all be done somehow with ffmpeg, ffcast or something like that?
[16:06:33] <sfan5> could also just use tcp:// output
[16:07:22] *** Quits: linjie (~linjie@58.247.210.251) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:07:45] <BtbN> That's a pretty bad idea, that has absolutely no control over the stream whatsoever
[16:07:59] <BtbN> Using something like rtmp, srt, and whatever else is a much safer choice
[16:08:22] <BtbN> hendry, ffmpeg supports streaming to an rtmp server just fine
[16:08:52] <BtbN> The other protocols you'll have to fiddle around with a bunch, most of them have some quirks
[16:09:16] <BtbN> That's why rtmp is still hanging around, because of it's simplicity. At least from the users viewpoint.

[20:40:23] <Guest6> just spins
[20:40:57] <BtbN> Most files you cannot play until they are finalized
[20:41:06] <BtbN> Why don't you just open the webcam directly in VLC?
[20:41:14] <Guest6> You can check everything's working by browsing to http://<Your Pi's IP>:8080/camera.mjpeg to view the 5fps live stream.
[20:41:19] <Guest6> this part does not work
[20:41:48] <Guest6> then i have to put vlc on every machine, i  just  was trying to view from my browser
[20:42:25] <Guest6> octoprint needs a url tho it seems
[20:43:47] <Guest6> yea opening the camera directly in vlc works fine
[20:44:04] <Guest6> but how do i view it in my browser? do i need more software to do that
[20:52:32] <BtbN> You'll need to write some web application that's capable to play the stream
[20:52:50] <BtbN> with hls.js or something, and then have ffmpeg write hls and serve it with some http server

[23:11:28] <Terrence> If anyone else knows what may be the problem, I've been trying to produce an audio file that only contains certain frames after running a filter on every frame in an input file
[23:12:14] <Terrence> I've already included the encoder and muxer and applied a flag to determine whether or not to send the frame to the encoder and write the packet to an output file
[23:12:50] <Terrence> Although it produces a new output file, the file is exactly the same as the input file and includes the frames that I do want
[23:14:57] <Terrence> https://pastebin.com/FPsfktUq
[23:15:31] <Terrence> This is my current code where the decision of what frame to keep is made, is there any problem with this method because I feel it was done correctly
[23:26:09] <Terrence> Any happen to know what the issue could be?
