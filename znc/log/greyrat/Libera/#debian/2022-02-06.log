[00:07:08] <tomreyn> if you have another computer (mobile phones and tabs are computers, too) which can run an ssh client, you could also ssh in and   dmesg -w    and see what is gets logged when the system freezes

[07:53:42] <jmcnaught> Jim`: bullseye will have newer versions of most packages than buster.  You can read about what is new in the release notes: https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes
[07:54:35] <Jim`> jmcnaught: I assume that it's good to keep up to date?
[07:54:46] <Jim`> and eventually the old release will die out?
[07:56:10] <jmcnaught> Jim`: there is a new major release of Debian about every couple of years.  Stable releases get security support but no major version bumps with few exceptions like firefox-esr.  Oldstable (buster) gets security support for about a year after the new release.
[07:56:34] <jmcnaught> !lts
[07:56:34] <dpkg> Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years.  Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies.  Ask me about <jessie-lts> and <stretch-lts> and see https://wiki.debian.org/LTS for more information.  #debian-lts on irc.oftc.net.
[07:57:04] <jmcnaught> Jim`: after Debian security team's support ends the LTS project extends the security support of a release ^^
[07:58:49] <Jim`> Sounds like I pretty  much do need to keep current as possible..

[08:00:30] <Jim`> After CentOS went I kind of am at a loss what to do with old machines other than debian
[08:00:55] <jmcnaught> Jim`: buster is still getting security updates, but bullseye has improved software so I see no reason not to upgrade in most cases, there are upgrade instructions in the release notes.

[12:36:53] <Khepra> depending on the motherboard it might happen that some are sharing the group. USB most likely.
[12:37:41] <lemming> looks to be, the GPU and HDA share one, but other than everything seems to be on it's own group.
[12:38:04] <Khepra> GPU And HDMI, but not HDA, right?
[12:38:12] <Khepra> HDMi audio I mean
[12:38:24] <Khepra> snd_hda_intel shouldn't be
[12:38:32] <lemming> that's what I meant by HDA, High Definition Audio for nvidia
[12:38:47] <lemming> not an intel system so no intel HDA :-P
[12:39:01] <lemming> no soundcard at all actually, other than the one on the GPU
[12:39:12] <Khepra> ah ok. that's expected. okay. I'm not sure about DMAR... I don't have much experience with it, but to passthrough GPU you need just a few prerequisites
[12:39:26] <Khepra> lemming: first, is this for a gaming VM or some other reason for GPU passthru?
[12:40:03] <lemming> video encode/decode
[12:40:33] <Khepra> okay so it's just teh gpu, you don't need unvirtualized, low latency USB inputs, or audio, those can remain virtualized, yes?
[12:40:38] *** Quits: fcinq (~irc@46.105.34.51) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:40:44] <lemming> nope, just the GPU, that's all I need

[12:42:22] <Khepra> so then basically, you need to assign the gpu via vfio-pci before the host's gpu drivers can grab it. do you know how to do that?
[12:42:48] *** Joins: timahvo1 (~rogue@41.80.97.84)
[12:42:55] <lemming> yeah I've got got the VFIO driver loading, just the guide I was following was showing DMAR as a requirement, and I can't get that to work
[12:43:07] <Khepra> also, everything else in the same IOMMU group will (and must be) pass through. it's not possible not to. you're basically passing through entire group, not just individual components in it

[18:11:33] <ormaaj> hm right so the logout works. i guess that kind of depends on how it was invoked. I have to think about how to handle that. My login shell is bash which runs a bunch of environment setup stuff before either execing tmux or attaching to a new tmux "session group" in an existing session. And how that's handled depends on whether the login is local or remote. Then there's a whole bunch of script stuff for shuffling around environment vars for dbus, {gpg,ssh}-agent

[19:58:11] <f-a> welp that was meant to be in «»
[19:58:20] <f-a> «f-a, have you tried doing a microcode update?»
[19:58:44] <f-a> now, I know my microcode version is
[19:58:44] <f-a> f@mkiii:~/spool$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep micro
[19:58:44] <f-a> microcode       : 0x2e
[19:59:26] <f-a> and this is my `lscpu` http://paste.debian.net/1229796/
[19:59:34] <f-a> Q: how do I know if my microcode is up to date?
[20:00:42] <Mister00X> f-a:  I guess apt policy intel-microcode is a good start
[20:00:55] <ormaaj> f-a: Long ago there was a "microcode-update" utility for x86 chips. At some point that was absorbed into the kernel and I'm pretty sure you don't have to do anything except install a package that contains intel's updates
[20:01:45] <f-a> apt policy intel-microcode http://paste.debian.net/1229797/
[20:02:23] *** Joins: magnavox (~MagnaVox@user/MagnaVox)
[20:02:41] <Mister00X> Then assuming there has been an microcode update that is not allready in your bios your microcode is not  up to date
[20:03:12] <f-a> ok, more general question. My vendor provides a huge page of updates and instructions https://support.starlabs.systems/kb/bios-and-firmware/bios-and-firmware
[20:03:27] <f-a> some of the instructions are on scary level (do this, but do not turn off the machine or you will brick it)
[20:03:49] <f-a> whom should I «trust» with these updates? debian or my vendor?
[20:04:10] <f-a> I understand it is a very general question, but I would like to understand the problem more
[20:04:18] <sussudio> bios updates are not like firmware ones.
[20:04:28] <Mister00X> f-a:  well a microcode like in debian is like runtime patching the proccesor while bios updates are different
[20:04:33] <sussudio> firmware updates get loaded on every boot.
[20:05:05] <f-a> thanks
[20:05:13] <sussudio> well, microcode updates.
[20:05:47] <Mister00X> Also Star Labs provides bios and firmware updates via the lfvs which is nice
[20:05:48] <f-a> final 2 questions: 1. is there a chance that `apt-get install intel-microcode` will be dangerous? and do I need to reboot to see its effects?
[20:06:08] <Mister00X> 1. theory it could be   2. yes
[20:06:27] <f-a> Mister00X: if I read correctly, it is not possible if you have an ncrypted partition (I do)
[20:06:32] <f-a> mhhh
[20:06:48] <f-a> how bad Mister00X ? is there anything I can do to mitigate it/check it will not blow up etc.?
[20:07:17] <ormaaj> f-a: All of the microcode comes from intel. There aren't like OEM mods or anything as far as I'm aware. It's the exact same chip-specific blob for every distro and OS.
[20:07:29] <ormaaj> intel / AMD / whatever
[20:08:33] <Mister00X> they could have a bug preventing you from booting for example...... but I guess it is as dangerous as having a serious kernel regression

[20:09:15] *** Quits: craigevil (craig@user/craigevil) (Quit: leaving)
[20:11:05] <ormaaj> Mister00X: as sussudio pointed out, no. There is no onboard eeprom or anything like that. The factory microcode is immutable and any changes have to be loaded on each boot, so bricking your CPU that way is impossible.

[23:51:29] <HelloShitty> Hello. I created a qemu VM and I started it but at some point the VM got herself into a Pause state and I can't "unpause" it. Anyone knows about this behaviour? And how to "unpause" the VM ?
[23:51:52] <HelloShitty> I force restarted the VM and now, while booting it gets into this Paused mode and I can't do anything
