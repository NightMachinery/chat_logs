[01:44:08] <akk> Any experts on either mplayer or vlc? I'm trying to figure out a commandline that can specify multiple videos but start at different times into them.
[01:44:25] <akk> Like this, except it doesn't work: vlc file1.mp4 --start-time 30 file2.mp4 --start-time 18 file3.mp4

[01:45:01] <akk> Specifying a start-time for file2 seems to confuse the displaying of file1, in both vlc and mplayer.
[01:45:01] <keir> s/to the fair/to be fair/
[01:45:12] <akk> Minus_One: Yes, exactly, like a playlist.
[01:45:34] <Sauvin> Sure, you can. Script it!
[01:45:53] <akk> Sauvin: This is in a script. Now, what command line do I put in that script? :)
[01:46:11] <Sauvin> It'd be a series of mplayer or mpv or vlc or whatever invocations.
[01:46:14] <Minus_One> akk, there is a hacky way you could try to do it. VLC has an auto-resume feature. I assume it stores the resume time in either a file or metadata. So you can set that manually, then configure vlc to automatically resume playback

[01:49:17] <Minus_One> akk, probably video editing is your best bet if you need all that. I think there are comman line tools that can split a file at a specified time

[01:51:36] <akk> I have done that before and it's way easier than these nonlinear video editors.

[02:35:41] <tirnanog> defjam: and, to be clear, the behaviour evidenced in the second case does require that you be using bash (or some other shell that implements brace expansion in the way that it does).
[02:35:46] <Minus_One> I think jim may have been scrolled up a tad bit :-)

[02:36:41] <jcbjoe2021> guys my rsync screwed up and copied files to the root of my external hdd and not into a folder. how can i rsync it all again and copy all the directories into the correct folder on my external from the command line using rsync?

[02:39:51] <tirnanog> defjam: it's unlikely to matter but, technically, quoting/escaping the * is the right thing to do, yes.
[02:39:56] <jcbjoe2021> codeswhite: jusat ask =)
[02:39:58] <codeswhite> I wrote a script that combines DD with PV effectively
[02:40:05] <jcbjoe2021> s/jusat/just
[02:40:12] <codeswhite> You are welcome to take a look:
[02:40:20] <codeswhite> https://github.com/codeswhite/ddpv
[02:40:24] <tirnanog> defjam: because, otherwise, arg #3 could be treated as a glob by bash itself. unlikely, as the filename would have to be named "--exclude-dir=..." but still.
[02:40:27] <defjam> on my machine tirnanog when i didnt escape the * it just finished immediately without finding anything
[02:40:40] <keir> defjam: the -E flag isn't necessary
[02:40:52] <tirnanog> defjam: check for yourself with printf.
[02:41:07] <defjam> ill try that tirnanog
[02:41:07] <tirnanog> defjam: if you remove the single quotes, you will almost certainly find that the composition is exactly the same.
[02:41:16] <defjam> didnt know you cold do that
[02:41:25] <defjam> thanks so much for the education
[02:41:39] <tirnanog> defjam: but again, quoting is the technically correct thing to do because you're trying to pass .* literally to grep, not have the shell pounce on it.
[02:41:50] <tirnanog> and the single quotes guarantee the shell leaves it well alone.
[02:42:01] <defjam> yes
[02:42:09] <defjam> ah ok great
[02:43:04] <keir> jcbjoe2021: couldn't you just delete the files you synced?

[05:05:56] <jack3k3> Hey all - im working with the linux regulator framework and looking for a solution - I currently have an embedded board with a bunch of regulators supplying various chips. So I have added all my regulators in the device tree and associated the relevent device nodes with the regulator supplying them so it gets turned on/off by the driver as needed. However I have a few chips that have no driver that I'm going to control through other mea
[05:06:37] <jack3k3> Is there such a thing available where I can create a device tree node for my "device" and associate it with a regulator and have it generate say a sysfs interface for me to turn on/off the device (i.e. its regulator)?

[07:15:57] <jack3k3> One more regulator question - I have the following hardware setup: regulator X supplies a downstream regulator Y, but the Y regulators' enable pin comes from a different regulator Z's output. My first thought was for regulator Y's entry in the DT I would just give two "parent" regulators e.g. by passing two phandle entries of X & Z to "vin-supply", however it appears the regulator framework does not allow multiple parents like this
[07:16:01] <ayecee> that's impossible.

[09:09:44] <uQvWbZ9X> I feel like linux/gnu is unwieldy in some ways.  Building new operating systems seem to fail whether it is Woof-CE, slax, even linux-from-scratch, gentoo, or arch.  My goal would be to try to build something like puppylinux, but maybe lighter and more modular like tinycore.  This way I could boot only those programs needed into memory for that particular purpose like gaming, browsing, or development, and unused or nonworking software can be omitted.
[09:09:44] <uQvWbZ9X> Also, relatively recent stable software could be used.  How feasible is this?

[11:02:29] <thurstylark> fluter: sudo is disallowed, as in this isn't your machine and whoever manages it doesn't let you use it, or as in you just don't want to use sudo?

[11:04:21] <fluter> just loopback, where data never leaves local host
[11:04:57] <thurstylark> you need root to capture packets on any network interface. loopback interfaces are network interfaces
[11:05:21] <fluter> thurstylark: is there any other way to do a kind of capture?

[11:05:51] <fluter> is there way to see this infomation without tcpdump?
[11:06:40] <thurstylark> you could mitm yourself with other hardware, but that could raise some red flags in IT

[11:31:54] <magnus1> log does not show any errors. if I check iotop, there is nothing else using the disk. The server is running  in hardware raid mode and if I check the disk status via the administrative interface (iDRAC), everything is in good health and no alarms

[15:24:08] <sem> how do *you* pronounce it

[15:24:13] <sem> or is it different each time

[15:26:21] <Kingsy> can someone suggest any dwm alternatives? I absolutely LOVE dwm. the keybindings and the stacking stle amazing, but the configuration just isnt for me.
[15:27:10] <jim> fvwm? twm? kwm? i3? there are at least a couple handfuls of others
[15:27:25] <n4dir> for a while not, but the last weeks i heard "awesome" more often again.
[15:27:41] <jim> isn't configuration a set-and-forget thing?
[15:27:41] <n4dir> assuming you sure want tiling wm
[15:27:57] <Kingsy> the default keybindings for i3 or just horrible. I really like how dwm jsut auto stacks.
[15:28:24] <Kingsy> jim: yeah but when youy go to add big features it can become a pain in the ass with conflicts. applying diffs and all sorts.
[15:28:49] <n4dir> you never hear of ratpoison, and the name alone would make it a good choice.
[15:28:52] <rambleba1> Kingsy you can change the keybinding, and beware of awesome, there will not be a Wayland port AFAIK
[15:29:19] <Kingsy> yeah I was thinking about using this change to transition to wayland.. worth it?
[15:29:28] <n4dir> enlightenment, i refer to it as e17 (wrongly) seems to have tiling too, but i for one couldn't figure it out
[15:29:39] <Guest6834> I don't agree with people connected 24 hours; it is like "should I talk to him? Will he be active/available right now? Will I annoy him if I do it? Will I have to wait for hours until an answer? (if I get one)."
[15:29:44] <Guest6834> Also, how could a non-24-hours user be in contact with a 24-hours one? It is like these 2 systems are not compatible.
[15:29:48] <Guest6834> What do you think?
[15:30:03] <rambleba1> Also, I was on awesome and switched to i3 in preparation to move to sway in my next laptop but then I moved to KDE because I dont wanna wire every hardware key up myself and with libvirt I would need POLKIT and that works out of the box in KDE
[15:30:05] <n4dir> being able to configure it with gui-tools proves that that doesn't always makes configuration more comfortable, as far it is me

[15:36:15] <angular_mike_> any idea why olddefconfig changed SND_HDA_PREALLOC_SIZE 2048 -> 0?
[15:36:41] <jim> Kingsy, another advantage... your parser can try to read a dwm config and generate for whichever wm you're trying out

[16:59:39] <Psi-Jack> Yep. No NS records on the zone. So nothing has authority either.
[16:59:58] <bailsman> It does feel like throttling somewhere. But the weird thing is, if I go directly over the internet, I can get that 9000 consistently. I only get this sawtooth pattern over a VPN.
[17:00:11] <Psi-Jack> What VPN?
[17:00:23] <ayecee> frojnd: the nameservers for the .top TLD return nothing for the domain. dig -t ns top  shows the TLD ns, and those don't know about frojnd.top yet.
[17:00:39] <bailsman> But what's the mechanism by which the throttling happens? You'd need to delay or drop packets right? To effect congestion control? I should be able to see that show up somewhere in wireshark right maybe?
[17:00:51] <ayecee> bailsman: a vpn explains that weird MSS.
[17:01:03] <DLange> bailsman: your VPN is just bandwidth limiting you
[17:01:14] <bailsman> How is it doing that, though? Can I see that in action?
[17:01:15] <Psi-Jack> What VPN?
[17:01:22] <DLange> ie it only forwards N packets/bytes for you per timeslice
[17:01:39] <bailsman> DLange: so once the limit is reached, I should be able to see packets getting delayed, right?
[17:01:52] <DLange> you can get the timeslice by looking at the distance between peaks in your bandwidth diagram
[17:01:52] <bailsman> say packets 1 to N are fast, but N to 2N are slow
[17:02:04] <ayecee> bailsman: the large rtt suggests that there is indeed a delay
[17:02:10] <Psi-Jack> bailsman: That question is for you in case you missed it.
[17:02:15] <bailsman> very interesting
[17:02:25] <bailsman> Psi-Jack: sorry, I don't understand your question.
[17:02:43] <DLange> bailsman: there's gazillion of traffic shaping algorithms, the one you cited is may be a bit too primitive but you found your culprit
[17:02:45] <Psi-Jack> What VPN software are you using? Is it directly connected to the target host?
[17:02:47] <ayecee> bailsman: it's difficult to eyeball delay and packet loss for a single flow, isn't it?
[17:02:59] <bailsman> There is 0 packet loss.
[17:03:03] <bailsman> Psi-Jack: Azure VPN client

[17:03:30] <Psi-Jack> Huh? Azure has their own? I don't think so.
[17:03:36] <bailsman> both client and server report no packet loss (0 retransmissions)
[17:03:49] <ayecee> report it where?
[17:03:53] <bailsman> in their output
[17:03:57] <ayecee> output from what?
[17:04:02] <bailsman> ss (server) and wireshark (client)
[17:04:03] <DLange> Azure VPN limits to 100Mbps (or 200Mbps for "High Performance")
[17:04:09] <bailsman> I'm nowhere near 100Mbps
[17:04:10] <ayecee> where do ss and wireshark report that?
[17:04:24] <ayecee> 10 megabytes per second is 100mbps
[17:04:41] <ayecee> well, Mbps
[17:04:48] <bailsman> right, but I'm getting maybe 1/7th of that. If I could get the 100mbit/s that would be fine.
[17:04:54] <bailsman> in the line of output I posted at the top (if there are retransmissoins, it will show)
[17:05:06] <bailsman> wireshark reports it in the bottom right hand corner. (and also shows them in red in the display field)

[17:41:35] <bailsman> ayecee: yeah but I figured it out - it's the RTT as we suspected. I've been watching RTT more closely - during periods when the connection is fast, the RTT is low, max 200ms. When it is slow, it can go over 2000ms. So delay is increasing as a method of congestion control. And it works well, because the longer the RTT, the lower the bandwidth, unless the window incerases.

[17:46:04] <Minus_One> yes bailsman but I want to get him started on understanding io redirection
[17:46:45] <bailsman> so my ISP could be traffic shaping on whatever ports are used by the VPN, but leaving port 80 unthrottled
[17:46:46] <Minus_One> command1 | while read -r line; do {stuff with line}; done will iterated lines of output from command1 in a loop
[17:46:58] <bailsman> or that azure vpn gateway could have some bandwidth limitation that azure support swears it does not
[17:47:08] <neckfreak> See :), this is exactly where things go wrong - can't make head or tails with "command1 2>&1" - for example, how to send a list of files to be processed by ffprobe?
[17:47:15] *** Quits: job (~job@wikimedia-commons/pandakekok9) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:47:20] <Minus_One> neckfreak, the solution is to play with it
[17:47:30] <Minus_One> and/or research shell input redirection
[17:47:43] <Minus_One> (or output redirection)
[17:47:45] <keir> and read the man pages to see if and how they accept stdin
[17:47:47] <bailsman> neckfreak: command_that_outputs_lits | while read line; do echo Your line is: "$line"; done
[17:47:47] <oldgalileo> iomari891: Probably start with systemd and use the RequiredBy option
[17:47:57] <ayecee> bailsman: I suppose one could test using the same VPN but a different ISP, or test for the behavior without VPN but with a non-standard port
[17:48:24] <bailsman> neckfreak: That's assuming you wanted it to process one by one. In that case, you can use the echo to confirm the loop is working well, then replace the echo with what you actually wanted
[17:48:57] <ayecee> bailsman: or a different vpn provider but using the same type of vpn?
[17:49:01] <bailsman> neckfreak: another thing you can do is `name_of_variable=$(command_that_outputs_list)` to put the output in a variable which you can then use like: `echo the list is: "$name_of_variable"`
[17:49:16] <ayecee> or a different type of vpn, also
[17:49:22] <Minus_One> bailsman, read -r line is best practice over read line. Not that it should matter in this case
[17:49:25] <neckfreak> Thanks for the input! Going to read and test for a bit.

[17:53:31] <bailsman> Mayb ethe time investment isn't worth it.
[17:53:37] <ayecee> also the bash script is easier to relate to the commands you're already typing in.

[21:24:56] <themachine> I mean, while you are technically right have you ever seen anything name files with two leading dots?
[21:25:00] <themachine> who or what does that?

[21:28:42] <themachine> well it will attempt to but fail
[21:28:50] <Sayona> What software/service do you use to sync data across multiple devices?
[21:28:58] <Mathisen> rsync
[21:29:16] <themachine> I don't think there is a fully shell independent way to make mv do what you want because the * expansion is part of the shell
[21:29:31] <Mathisen> but kinda depends what devices.. i mean for my phone and such i just use nextcloud to sync stuff
[21:29:39] <themachine> you can change your globbing settings but then it's not truly shell indepenant

[21:33:24] <themachine> or use rsync as suggested
[21:34:06] <alkisg> `mv folder/.[^.]* dest` kinda works, if you don't have anything starting with two dots, and for bash there's `shopt -s dotglob; mv folder/* dest`. And then there's `find` and `rsync`...

[23:57:29] <thurstylark> jcbjoe2021: it's generally recommended to avoid parsing the output of ls because it's not meant for that. find is better suited for that kind of thing
[23:57:32] <Mathisen> jcbjoe2021, you can use the find command, what dist are you on btw ?
[23:57:44] <PowerMan2206> Although finding a PCI (non-e) card will be a pain
[23:57:50] <jcbjoe2021> Mathisen: arch
[23:58:21] <thurstylark> also, kind of a small thing, but linux doesn't care too much about the file type based on file extension, so don't get too caught up in those
[23:58:26] <Pexin> you think that's bad, this past couple weeks I've been wrestling with a 10+ year old laptop which _somehow_ got its bios overwritten with the wrong firmware. no clue how. the alleged official firmare only comes as a windows exe, so swapped HD to try that and it claims the bios is incompatible but I think it's because it's reading the current bios and finds a mismatch
[23:58:43] <Mathisen> jcbjoe2021, ok the to answer your older question install tldr > pacman -S tldr then you can easy info on commands example > tldr cp with examples and easy explansion
[23:58:57] <PowerMan2206> thurstylark: as a wise man once said, "everything is a file, including directories"
