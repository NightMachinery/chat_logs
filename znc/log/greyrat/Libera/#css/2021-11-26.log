[01:38:06] <TheSilentLink> thank you this is exactly what I want! However I have tried importing the changes but I'm not having any luck!
[01:40:16] <hassoon> what do you mean
[01:40:25] <hassoon> that css code should fix your issue
[01:42:39] <hassoon> TheSilentLink: are you aware of that ? https://i.imgur.com/dRJheF2.png
[01:44:01] <TheSilentLink> hassoon: yep that is was it. Thank you so much! If it isn't too much hassle would you mind explaining what you did?
[01:47:01] <hassoon> TheSilentLink: the video-js version you are using renders a very large padding inside the video-js#my-player, which screws things up
[01:47:20] <TheSilentLink> I'm using the latest version
[01:49:28] <hassoon> TheSilentLink: you just need to nullify that silly and large padding, make the said element stretch inside its parent by making its parent a flex container, and then ensure the said parent is itself stretched, in your acase it should stretch and take up the whole space left after the top navbar, and that itself is done by setting the body element to be a flex container and give flex-grow:1 for the parent of
[01:49:34] <hassoon> the said video-js#my-player element, but body itself needs to be stretched for all of this to work, and so does html
[01:50:29] <TheSilentLink> ah I see that makes sense. Thanks a lot for your help!

[04:17:22] <znf> Does anyone know anything about Safari specific quirks with Media Queries and SVG images? Safari is kicking my ass and I don't know why/how to fix it
[04:17:54] <znf> To be more specific, I'm using a media query inside a SVG that swaps the colors around for a logo. This works as I'm expecting it to in Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc. you name it
[04:18:45] <znf> ...surprisingly, it even works as it should in IE11, of all things
[04:20:38] <znf> Then pen is here: https://codepen.io/Znuff/pen/qBXeRZp -- Safari: https://i.imgur.com/Ex94HFB.png vs Chrome: https://i.imgur.com/08pXavj.png
[04:21:11] <znf> I've legit been struggling for weeks on this one, and it's stressing me out; Granted our Safari desktop share is quite small, but still bugging the hell out of me

[04:32:05] <znf> *blink*
[04:32:42] <drej> but i could be wrong
[04:38:18] <znf> it does work here tough: https://artists.spotify.com
[04:38:36] <znf> if you narrow the viewport, their logo loses the "Spotify"

[04:40:27] <znf> but this example still works: https://codepen.io/jmperez/pen/ERMxmZ
[04:42:21] <drej> maybe it's not that it doesnt support media query per se, but maybe just a few things like display property but not colour?
[04:42:49] <drej> *visibility not display
[04:44:05] <znf> in the process of trying it now
[04:44:13] <drej> im only throwing like 5% of my brain at this, i'm on a bridge for black friday monitoring

[04:44:29] <znf> oh right, forgot the US is celebrating
[04:45:38] <drej> im in canada, but we do it as well even though our thanksgiving was like a month ago

[05:17:48] <drej> you know its bad when you prefer outlook
[05:17:49] <drej> lol
[05:20:00] <znf> I stuck to the server part, I like my CLI better than I like battling browsers
