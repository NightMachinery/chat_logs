[01:15:02] <CarloWood> What is the best / easiest way to store a few very short strings - so that I can find if they exist and in what order they were added?
[01:15:51] <CarloWood> A "hash" map with 256 buckets for the first character would be nice (fast).
[01:16:06] <bpalmer> if they're very short, it is very quick to just compare against them directly. So a circular buffer/array would do
[01:16:16] <bpalmer> std::string cache[10];
[01:17:07] <TinoDidriksen> Few and short? Just vector then.
[01:17:07] <CarloWood> They will definitely fit in a std::string yeah - I think.
[01:17:39] <TinoDidriksen> 256 buckets is already far beyond "a few"
[01:17:55] <CarloWood> How many chars can one store in a std::string without allocation?
[01:18:07] <bpalmer> std::strings require allocation to begin with.
[01:18:14] <hachikuji[m]> like 24
[01:18:26] <CarloWood> Oh lol - my strings are 1 to 4 chars.
[01:18:41] <TinoDidriksen> I think libstdc++ stores 15 and libc++ stores 21.
[01:19:09] <TinoDidriksen> << string().capacity(); // indeed, 15.
[01:19:09] <geordi> 15
[01:19:20] <CarloWood> I'll just put them in a vector then I guess.  I'll have to run over the whole vector for every character in a longer string then though, and most won't match anything - so really have to traverse the whole vector every time...
[01:19:51] <TinoDidriksen> bpalmer, std::string is small-string optimized since C++11
[01:20:31] <TinoDidriksen> CarloWood, traversing the whole vector is fine for "a few" ... but what is a few to you?
[01:20:51] <TinoDidriksen> I'd say "a few" is <= 10.

[01:40:26] <CarloWood> In this case "the best" was short for "please give suggestions" - and everyone knows I am a speed freak, so I explicitly added "/ easiest" to hint that in this case a short version using nice stdc++ functions would be fine when squeezing out the last clock cycle would make it large or complex.
[01:40:49] <ville> unfortunately then it also ends up in the vocabulary of new people. just stop using the broken pattern and ask: "what options do i have to do x?" cause that's what you wanted anyways
[01:41:45] <CarloWood> nah
[01:43:09] <CarloWood> If some 'new people' ask what is the best, I'd answer "that depends, what exactly do you do / want?". It's kinda like "how are you?" Nobody cares, but it is a good way to start a conversation. Inquiry in this case.
[01:44:09] <enterprisey> "what options do I have to do x", taken literally, also gets you the bad options
[01:44:25] <enterprisey> if you're asking the best way to do x, it means you're trying to accomplish x
[01:44:45] <enterprisey> if you're asking the options for x, it means you probably know how to accomplish x but you're doing some exploration

[18:01:10] <latterly[m]> Ashurban: yes
[18:01:15] <vdamewood> latterly[m]: Yeah, since va_arg doesn't handle references, all values passed in the variadic part are rvalues.
[18:01:33] <vdamewood> And you can only have one variadic list of arguments in a function signature
[18:02:29] <furrymcgee> I mean to use classes for inputs and outputs: int function(input(varargs), output(varargs))
[18:03:23] <vdamewood> Oh, like a stringstream or such.
[18:03:34] <latterly[m]> furrymcgee: that's clever, I like it
[18:03:47] <Ashurban> can you actually master a language using books alone? a lot of people i know learned languages basically by trial-and-error
[18:04:09] <latterly[m]> currently I'm targeting c17, would going over to c20 make a difference if I can use concepts to constrain the types?
[18:04:40] <Ashurban> vdamewood seems to be proficient at C++, sir may i ask you how you mastered this notorious language

[18:07:54] <Milo> three is way too big of a number.
[18:08:25] <vdamewood> I wonder whatever happened to my copy of Teach Yourself C++ in 21 days.
[18:08:50] <latterly[m]> Milo: I only need 2 numbers - 0, 1, n
[18:09:17] <vdamewood> I only learned one thing from that book. It had an exercise to re implement (partially) std::string, and in doing so, it made encapsulation, and how implementing a class actually works.
[18:09:26] <Milo> I'm wondering which m-value will cause out of bound exception with your name

[18:12:46] <Ashurban> ofcourse im not learning c++ merely for the $$$, im into math mostly. im transitioning into software after reading several books on C and data structures, it is very interesting
[18:13:03] <Ashurban> everything follows a certain logic
[18:13:05] <vdamewood> I'd need people to actually hire me to be a freelancer, and I can't afford drinks because no one hires me. (Though, I don't drink anyway)
[18:17:05] <Ashurban> are there any chances of rust taking over the existing variations of C in the future?

[23:24:09] <danieldg> that's my reading of the union part of the spec, yes
[23:24:51] <rpav> that's _necessary_ isn't it?
[23:25:10] <danieldg> making it work any other way is kinda asking for problems
[23:25:14] <rpav> ~U() could call it or something else could, but _not_ doing that is UB afaik
[23:27:44] <Alipha> danieldg: also, can you just create a smaller scope for the variable? you can put arbitrary scopes anywhere
[23:28:32] <danieldg> my example:  big_tree s; s.build_tree(); auto res = s.summarize(); s.~big_tree(); res.do_more_stuff(stdout);
[23:28:44] <danieldg> I need to use res after the end of the scope
[23:29:51] <danieldg> if this were C I'd just have res be uninit in a higher scope
[23:30:42] <Alipha> auto res = build_and_summarize_tree(); res.do_more_stuff(stdout);  // :-)
[23:31:41] <Alipha> i understand it's not always so simple. but perhaps give another look at it ;-)
[23:33:31] *** Joins: vicfred (~vicfred@user/vicfred)
[23:34:38] <danieldg> well, I would need to untangle a lot more than that, because right now it's actually multiple f1() { build(method_1); common_summarize(build); }
[23:35:21] <danieldg> but adding enough helper functions would make it work I guess
[23:36:37] <Alipha> do whatever is clearest
[23:36:39] <danieldg> I really just want rust's "move ownership into the called function and let it drop it" here :)

[23:40:16] <hachikuji[m]> you're not going to get that in C++ no matter what you do, use after move is perfectly valid in C++
[23:40:45] <hachikuji[m]> object can be reinitialized once more or even straight up used as if nothing happened
[23:40:50] *** Joins: Masklin (~joel@130.235.150.20)
[23:40:52] <danieldg> right, which is why other mechanisms are needed

[23:41:56] <danieldg> optional is probably the nicest solution
[23:42:05] <hachikuji[m]> asserts are the best you'll get if you really want to enforce something when you really should just be documenting what your code does
[23:43:19] <hachikuji[m]> more often than not, users of API need to know how it behaves anyway, thanks to Hyrum's law you can rely on people actually caring how your code works
[23:43:45] <danieldg> well, documentation is independent of actually making it work right, and atm this is just an internal function
[23:44:15] <hachikuji[m]> Documentation exists to document how to use it properly...
[23:44:58] <hachikuji[m]> it's a human explanation for design of your code, it's not independent from your API

[23:46:24] <anyone> Some software can be summarized as "Picasso coding"

[23:47:42] <anyone> BurumaSerafuku: no, seriously: when there are no comments and the code makes no sense
[23:47:56] <bpalmer> there are linters to warn if you use an object after std::move() out of it
[23:48:27] <danieldg> and yes, std::move is almost the right solution, but still not quite it
[23:50:37] <anyone> return by const T & might apply too
[23:53:35] <Alipha> danieldg: can you give big_tree an empty state?
[23:54:09] <danieldg> it's a class from another library, so no
[23:54:58] *** Joins: senoraraton (~senorarat@192-195-83-130.static.monkeybrains.net)
[23:55:26] <danieldg> that plus placement new would be an alternative, but I don't think it's any different in the end than this

[23:56:44] <danieldg> technically it has an 'empty state' constructor, but that constructor helpfully allocates a buffer for you to use because obviously you're going to be using it soon right?
[23:57:15] <anyone> danieldg: std::vector et al as a counterexample
[23:58:28] <danieldg> does vector allocate on zero-arg constructor? I thought it stored a null pointer in that case
[23:58:29] <anyone> Since move construction should preferably be noexcept, *not allocating* anything for the empty state is kind of the norm
[23:58:53] <danieldg> I agree
[23:58:57] <anyone> danieldg: that null pointer does not need (heap) allocation
[23:59:05] <danieldg> correct
[23:59:49] <danieldg> iirc it's like: class big_tree { vector foo; big_tree() foo(0, DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE) {} }
