[00:45:59] <evolv> mrig, what do you mean "you are propounding earth as the origin [of knowledge]?"
[00:46:32] <evolv> earth is one of the four elements of Buddhism that describes solidness
[00:46:45] <evolv> four elements as described in Buddhism*

[00:47:58] *** Joins: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato)
[00:48:41] <evolv> I'm also uncertain what is meant by "origin of knowledge." In Buddhism, whatever has an origin has a cause
[00:54:38] <mrig> budha being synonymous with prithvi and writing, and your traditions foundation upon scripture was the seed of the thought.
[00:54:48] <mrig> evolv: ^
[00:55:03] *** Quits: assan (uid454435@id-454435.uxbridge.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[00:55:25] <mrig> origin of everything really, is what I mean by knowledge there.
[00:55:45] <evolv> we never established that the Buddha's name is derived from budha, that requires support. The tradition is also not founded upon scripture
[00:57:12] <evolv> it existed before text, the oral tradition preserved the teachings intended for practice
[00:57:43] <mrig> well it seems that it is founded upon the transcription of a pali verbal tradition into scriptures in around the year 400ce or there abouts.
[00:58:10] <mrig> I was reading about pali, seems that it has a simplified subset of sanskrit grammar.
[00:58:18] <evolv> it is founded upon someone who achieved nibbana and taught the path to others
[00:58:33] <mrig> sure yes.
[00:58:44] <mrig> a buddha.
[01:01:06] <evolv> so, again, these connections you're making aren't clear
[01:01:11] <mrig> I've always been taught that it its the knowledge itself that is key and not the person who is teaching it.
[01:01:24] <mrig> I'm not making any connections.
[01:01:34] <mrig> am just talking about sanskrit grammar.
[01:01:41] <evolv> the key is the practice to gain knowledge
[01:02:44] <evolv> actually, the key is the practice to end suffering
[01:03:01] <evolv> this requires full knowledge of not self, impermanence, and suffering
[01:03:06] <evolv> and their relationships
[01:03:33] <mrig> are you speaking from experience or from texts?
[01:03:45] <mrig> what is suffering?
[01:03:52] *** Joins: saufa (~saufa@m91-129-111-250.cust.tele2.ee)
[01:04:08] <mrig> in sanskrit we would speak of sukha and dukha.
[01:04:54] <evolv> I'm speaking from teachings, whether it is from bhikkhu dhamma talks, their written teachings, or the pali canon texts, and some results gained from practice
[01:05:39] <evolv> dukkha in the context of the four noble truths is actually best translated as "unsatisfactoriness"
[01:05:39] <mrig> Oh I base most of my study of philosophy on experience.
[01:05:47] <evolv> which is an unsatisfactory word to use
[01:05:55] <evolv> in that it's ugly
[01:06:12] <evolv> it's best known as "suffering" in English, which isn't a completely correct translation
[01:06:13] <mrig> kha means to go.
[01:06:33] <evolv> a good alternative translation has been "stress"
[01:07:23] <mrig> dukha means going in a direction of suffering or burning.
[01:07:25] <evolv> experience is the most direct knowledge, but we tend to get experience by the teachings of others who have the experience
[01:07:42] <evolv> dukkha has multiple meanings
[01:07:57] <evolv> it depends on context
[01:08:01] <mrig> it is far from ugly, it is constructed from logical phonems.
[01:08:35] <evolv> just as there are multiple words with the same meaning, one word can have multiple meanings
[01:08:48] <mrig> sukha is going to wards softness and agreeable things.
[01:08:53] <evolv> this has made translations of ancient texts difficult for scholars, among many other reasons
[01:08:56] <mrig> kagha is a bird.
[01:09:08] <mrig> ka a crow
[01:09:26] <mrig> khaga rather
[01:09:50] <mrig> sure yes the language is more profound than the texts though.
[01:09:54] <mrig> I find
[01:10:21] <evolv> vinnana used in the sutta pitaka has multiple meanings
[01:10:37] <mrig> as I mentioned you approach is that of prithvi where I approach from vayu
[01:11:46] <mrig> one meaning with multiple applications.
[01:11:51] <evolv> my approach is that of citta :)
[01:12:29] <evolv> words are just constructs
[01:12:49] <evolv> like everything else conditioned, they require investigation
[01:13:00] <mrig> of course.
[01:13:01] <evolv> investigation not by intellectual means
[01:13:09] <evolv> by experience
[01:13:15] <mrig> sound and harmony though is not a construct.
[01:13:38] <evolv> those words mean something to you
[01:13:42] <mrig> the cosmos will whisper this to you if you listen very carefully.
[01:14:00] <evolv> what those words mean to you are unknown to me
[01:14:15] <mrig> no not the words, what lays beneath them does more so.
[01:14:39] <evolv> yes, the meaning is always what lies beneath them
[01:14:54] <mrig> that harmony of the cosmos is what bliss means to me.
[01:14:58] <evolv> which is why when you say those words, what they mean to you is the actual context
[01:15:54] <evolv> the cosmos is not self
[01:16:35] <mrig> sure yes, it is a tiny vibration in the dimension of knowledge in this particular slice of spacetime.
[01:16:56] <mrig> the self reflects the cosmos.
[01:17:07] <mrig> cosmos is very real.
[01:17:10] <evolv> the cosmos changes
[01:17:14] <mrig> sure yes.
[01:17:15] <evolv> what changes can not be self
[01:17:27] <mrig> the self changes.
[01:17:35] <mrig> atman does not.
[01:17:36] <evolv> then that is, by definition, not a self
[01:17:50] <evolv> atman and self are synonymous
[01:18:00] <evolv> not self is anatman
[01:18:13] <evolv> Pali: atta and anatta, respectively
[01:18:19] <mrig> cosmos is paramatman
[01:18:39] <evolv> cosmos is loka in pali
[01:19:04] <mrig> svaloka?
[01:19:13] <evolv> just loka
[01:19:47] <mrig> right that describes the essence of the thing.
[01:19:57] <evolv> not essence
[01:20:06] <evolv> they're conditioned existence
[01:20:15] <mrig> I would tend to use dimension for loka.
[01:20:31] <evolv> there are multiple dimensions within loka
[01:20:32] <evolv> or realms
[01:20:44] <evolv> hell realms, sensual realms, formless realms
[01:20:55] <mrig> the essence of the word cosmos I mean, not that it is actually the essence :)
[01:21:21] <mrig> same in kashmir philosophy too.
[01:21:56] <mrig> I still prefer mathematical terminology there though.
[01:22:17] <evolv> I prefer realms
[01:23:31] <evolv> Buddha taught that the path requires us to learn what things really aren't, rather than what it really is. What it really is, is empty
[01:23:37] <mrig> what is the lo from loka I wonder? ka i have the essence of in mind.
[01:23:43] <evolv> empty of self, but we only know that by learning what things are not
[01:28:12] <mrig> oh loca is sight lota tears, this is connected with what is observed.
[01:31:53] <evolv> there is formal language, then there is the way people speak
[01:32:04] <evolv> How Buddha spoke was to the common person
[01:32:41] <evolv> rigidity in language formalisms won't be much found in the sutta pitaka
[01:33:10] <mrig> Yes with a mind to alleviating suffering, from what I gather.
[01:33:12] <evolv> clearer meanings are found in similes that tie together what can be observed to what can be experienced from the teachings
[01:33:46] <mrig> oh there is no more rigidity is sanskrit than there is in sound, that I can see.
[01:33:51] <evolv> Buddha would also redefine terms existing in that time
[01:34:12] <mrig> than I  can hear I should say.
[01:34:56] <mrig> the resolution of it fits nicely, less dense languages seem to my mind to lead to rigidity of thought.
[01:35:20] <evolv> sound is just something that is perceived by the six sense bases
[01:35:20] <mrig> as they bifurcate and divide much faster.
[01:35:37] <evolv> in deep jhana, sound vanishes
[01:35:41] <evolv> as do the other five senses
[01:35:55] <mrig> I would say that sound transmits something far more fundamental.
[01:36:20] <mrig> the expression of consciousness.
[01:36:56] <evolv> what kind of consciousness?

[01:41:14] <evolv> "I am that" is a delusion
[01:41:49] <mrig> sure yes, well an illusion more so than necessarily a delusion.

[01:42:38] <mrig> at any one particular moment in time, it is different.

[20:11:19] <Irishmanluke> hi
[20:11:55] <Irishmanluke> Is there anybody out there?
[20:12:09] <iryith> probably not
[20:13:17] <Irishmanluke> with what probability
[20:13:39] <iryith> probably a monte carlo calculation
[20:15:05] <Irishmanluke> iryith: I spend a lot of time thinking about philosophy but I feel like a fraud because Ive read barely any philosophy

[20:15:24] <Irishmanluke> but Im trying to fix that
[20:15:39] <iryith> everyone can philosophize, you don't have to be classically trained
[20:15:41] <iryith> lord knows I'm not
[20:15:58] <Irishmanluke> sure but I think it would help
[20:16:21] <iryith> definitely
[20:16:26] <Irishmanluke> have you read any philosophy
[20:16:44] <iryith> I took a few courses in uni, try to read a bit on my own, but time is limited these days
[20:17:38] <Irishmanluke> you know I have 6 or 7 legitimate hardcore philosophy books but I think Ive only read one of them cover to cover
[20:17:59] <Irishmanluke> I have a tendancy to buy books and not read them
[20:18:09] <iryith> reading hardcore anything in an academic sense is never a good way to have an independent passion for learning something
[20:19:12] <iryith> at the end of the day, most people (myself included) just want to learn a bit about philosophy, not turn it into a profession, so why would you read an academic book on the subject? I had a hard enough time reading the academic books for my own profession that I make a living off of
[20:19:30] <Irishmanluke> well one of them I actually enjoy reading which is Anarchy State and Utopia by Nozick

[20:19:48] <ethereal> true, agreed iry
[20:20:18] <Irishmanluke> I enjoy reading academic books sometimes
[20:20:27] <iryith> they can be fun in some ways, true
[20:20:35] <iryith> but....in my experience, it's usually a slog
[20:20:46] <ethereal> yeah I have a few books that are just pretty ornaments atm, some I understood later I should've got more introductory books
[20:20:48] <Irishmanluke> but more than that I enjoy the deep understanding that can be gained from putting in the effort
[20:21:12] <iryith> Irishmanluke, very good point, to get to the core of things academic books are pretty good
[20:21:17] <iryith> just dry as fuck :D

[20:22:58] <Irishmanluke> Sometimes I thini of it like this, there are little gold nuggets of knowledge out there burried in these long dry books, you have to do a lot of digging to get to the gold but once you find it it can be very exciting
[20:25:39] <iryith> just depends on how much time you're willing to sift through the blah to get to the 'oh!'
[20:25:40] <Irishmanluke> that analogy implies that most of whats in most of these books is not important which isnt exactly what I meant to imply but that can sometimes be true as well.  When Im trying to understand a philosopher I dont know whether or not at the end of the process I will end up feeling like Ive gained some great incite but I would tend to belwive that if I read enough them I will start to accumulate
[20:25:46] <Irishmanluke> some great incites

[23:25:48] <Jong> When politicians invoke mentions of god, I have a hard time telling whether they really believe in a god or whether they're just trying to gain favor from their constituents who do. What do you think? If you were to assign a percentage, how often do you think it's for real and how often do you think they're faking it to gain favor?
[23:29:09] <LunaLinda> "Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful" Seneca
[23:34:22] <Irishmanluke> I think some of them beleive in god, others dont but virtually all of them are invoking god to gain favor
[23:35:57] <Jong> but how many are knowingly claiming to believe what they do not believe?
[23:36:07] <Irishmanluke> If I had to guess Id say that politicians being highly educated generally are less likely to believe in god then the average constituent but that doesnt really matter
[23:36:18] <Jong> how many are creating a false appearance and being insincere when invoking god
[23:37:08] <Irishmanluke> well most politicians are being insincere most of the time is what Im saying
[23:38:36] <Irishmanluke> Whether or not they truly believe in God us irrelevant because even the ones who do beleive in God would invoke god even if they didnt
