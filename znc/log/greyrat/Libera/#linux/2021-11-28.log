[00:51:43] <schuelermine[m]> GitHub is a git repository hosting and CI/CD and project management service
[00:52:00] <schuelermine[m]> A lot of software projects host or mirror their code on GitHub.
[00:52:03] <NyB> I wonder how many projects would be in real trouble if GitHub were to go down for a prolonged period of time
[00:52:12] <schuelermine[m]> Quite a few programs and websites download things from GitHub.
[00:52:28] <keir> none because the entire point of git is it's decentralised
[00:52:41] <NyB> yes, they would not lose their code
[00:52:43] <schuelermine[m]> Many companies and communities use GitHub‚Äôs community, project management, funding and CI/CD tools to improve their work

[00:53:10] <keir> sure but they wouldn't be in real trouble
[00:53:18] <schuelermine[m]> you could migrate to GitLab
[00:53:27] <keir> all those features are replicatable elsewhere
[00:53:38] <schuelermine[m]> except copilot maybe
[00:53:46] <EdFletcher> yeah it would be an annoyance to migrate to a new git host, but for most it wouldn't be catastrophic or prohibitively expensive
[00:53:47] <schuelermine[m]> but that‚Äôs controversial anyways
[00:54:04] <Sauvin> What is CI/CD?
[00:54:23] <kfrench> Continuous Integration/Continuous Development.
[00:54:30] <Sauvin> Ah, thank you.
[00:54:38] <keir> kfrench: Deployment
[00:54:39] <NyB> is D "development" or "deployment" ?
[00:54:42] <moonmoon> migrating to a different forge isn't exactly a trivial task if the original one is down. You lose all of your issues, etc. plus need to redo any CI/CD pipelines you have since they're all very vendor-specific
[00:55:04] * msiism would like to lose all of his issues.
[00:55:06] <moonmoon> it *can* be done but not something you'd relish doing
[00:55:09] <Sauvin> Point remains that if I had been involved with software development, "CI/CD" is something I'd be expect to know.

[00:55:49] <EdFletcher> true moonmoon, if all your eggs are in the github basket that'd be a lot tougher, but i know a lot of orgs that don't do that: for e.g. we use JIRA for issue tracking and CircleCI for CI, spinnaker for CD. so those wouldn't be affected by a migration to a new git host.
[00:55:53] <NyB> you'd need an expert on both sides of the migration

[00:56:46] * NyB is sad that distributed bug tracking did not really catch on...
[00:57:02] <msiism> Like, for example, Void Linux, they would be hit pretty hard if GitHub went down for a while.
[00:57:14] <keir> NyB: i think the Fossil VCS does it!
[00:57:36] <EdFletcher> moonmoon: yup true good point as well, lots of reconfiguration, retesting integrations, fixing what inevitably breaks... but again, not catastrophic or prohibitively expensive, just annoying üòÜ
[00:57:44] <moonmoon> (also CD stands for Continuous Deployment, not development)
[00:58:31] <moonmoon> best-case scenario is that the downtime serves as a wakeup call so that orgs relying on github start making a plan B
[00:58:38] <NyB> keir: I vaguely remember looking into that one, and I think it did something different? Could be wrong though. But these days anything but git and Mercurial is almost niche in the open source world, I think.
[00:59:09] <keir> Fossil is SQLite based, and also used for the SQLite project
[00:59:12] <NyB> plan Bs are expensive
[00:59:15] <keir> so it also does wiki and all that too

[11:16:57] <xx> in terms of wear that is
[11:17:53] <xx> though I wonder if that's because modern hdds wear out faster rather than ssds wearing out slower
[11:18:18] <sheep> modern ssds also have wear leveling abilities
[11:18:27] <Sauvin> The HDDs I'm using now are many years old and no sign of trouble.
[11:18:37] <stevecam> sheep, so do SSD's
[11:19:30] <xx> the failures/wearouts are more observable once you multiply the number of HDDs by a thousand or more
[11:19:50] <xx> that way you'll get your 40 failed ones a year
[11:20:47] <Sauvin> So a thousand customers walk into the computer store and each buy a drive, and they're all OK. I, of course, walk into the same store, buy 40 of them, and ALL of them turn up bad.

[12:47:41] <theos> selecting copy/paste with mouse has the same behavior
[12:47:47] <Sauvin> Trying copying something from the browser, open a new tab or window and paste into a Google search and see if what you copied gets pasted.
[12:48:26] <theos> Sauvin yes copy paste works inside chrome. between tabs etc.

[14:03:03] <Gaboradon> I have a bunch of PCs and I'm looking to install Manjaro Linux, I have one high-end with 2020 level HW, one mid-end with 2014 level HW and one high-end with 2012 level HW, I only need linux for utility, stability etc, should I pick an older HW ?

[14:49:34] *** Joins: acerbic (~acerbic@cs-xdata-50-86-50-241.cspire.com)
[14:50:26] <arinov> in the best case you will just recompile your arch kernel and enable the device (you need to find out wich one in laptop specs)
[14:50:47] <arinov> in the worst case you will develop the driver by own hands
[14:51:31] <JanC> actually, it says that it is using snd_rn_pci_acp3x ?
[14:51:32] <phogg> TomZanna: you are likely stuck until a kernel hacker intervenes. It's not just that it isn't matching your card to a driver that can handle it, it's that after such a match the driver isn't working. In the former case you can update the PCI ID mapping yourself. In your case some actual code change is likely required.
[14:51:53] <TomZanna> arinov: why no module? 1002:1637 load snd_hda_intel while 1022:15e2 loads snd_rn_pci_acp3x
[14:52:21] <phogg> I see the card mentioned here http://linux-hardware.org/index.php?probe=a3dcdfb8cd and then https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=d677af1f50&upgrade
[14:52:37] <arinov> i suppose the archlinux is just like ubuntu in kernel building - they are enable all the shit to make their disto boot every possible laptop, pc, fridge, etc, so you have almost zero chances to wait for it

[14:53:30] <TomZanna> arinov: oh, I get it. The kernel loads the wrong module then

[14:53:33] <arinov> TomZanna: sorry, i opened the lspci and see no devices, so i didnt open other attachments (bad support agent)
[14:53:54] <arinov> TomZanna: it is possible, yes

[23:27:39] <msiism> Nov28: So, what exactly did you add for the repository URL?
[23:27:45] <Sauvin> Nov28, you're using this channel for pretty much exactly what's intended: a place for people to share their Linux experiences and ask for help. Why don't you let *us* worry about what's too much?

[23:28:13] <Nov28> msiism: I really don't know, I use apt so rarely that I can't tell you what I've done, all I know is I copied the commands from the website
