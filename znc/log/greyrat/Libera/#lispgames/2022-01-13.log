[00:01:44] <artchad> I live with relatives, I don't need to pay rent. I just help with work on the fields, shoveling cow shit and the like.

[00:17:47] <aeth> food, though?
[00:20:28] <jstoddard> Shoveling cow shit and making video games is a cool combination. My brother is a ranch hand, but he would be an awesome game designer if he got into it.
[00:21:05] <manicennui> My dream is to have a cottage where I might also do some programming from time to time.
[00:41:30] <artchad> The 30Euros include miscellaneous expenses. We have chickens and vegetables and fruits, so things that I would buy includes flour, oil, oats, raisins, chocolate, soy milk, lemons, soy sauce, peanuts, etc.
[00:44:48] <artchad> I like to live minimalist, because it keeps my head space clean.

[02:04:11] <|3b|> Hectarea1996, borodust: https://github.com/awolven/cl-vulkan is supposed to be finished/usable, i haven't tried it myself though 
[02:04:48] <|3b|> Hectarea1996: and the doc dir in cl-opengl doesn't do anything, so you aren't missing anything by failing to build it :/
[02:05:32] * |3b| will probably remove that dir once cl-opengl development stops being stalled waiting for me to finish patches for upstream spec
[02:08:43] <|3b|> https://github.com/3b/learnopengl (along with the original learnopengl site) is the closest i have to modern docs/examples, but it is hard to write good docs for opengl on CL, since there are too many bits of infrastructure needed to write modern opengl in a nice style, but no real winners for libraries implementing those bits
[02:11:02] <pjb> manicennui: so basically you want to develop a little cottage industry.
[02:11:11] <manicennui> heh
[02:12:19] <|3b|> don't want to write out everything by hand, since that would be noisy and a bad example, but don't want to include yet another bad implementation of all the various bits in the tutorial either
[02:12:57] <|3b|> and can't really recommend any of the existing options, either because i don't use them, or because i do :p

[22:30:38] <jstoddard> Anyone here use tiled? I'm thinking about reinventing the wheel and slapping together a simple map editor this weekend, because I suspect it will be quicker than becoming comfortable with tiled and writing a tmx parser (or adapting someone else's) for my game.
[22:30:47] <jstoddard> Please talk me down from this if it's a bad idea.
[22:31:49] <dthompson> jstoddard: basic tiled support (i.e. just the features you actually use) is not that bad to write.
[22:32:03] <dthompson> and the format is decently well documented.
[22:32:47] <borodust> we have a couple tmx parsers for gamekit
[22:33:14] <borodust> before you dive into developing an editor, take a look at what UI options you have in CL
[22:33:39] <borodust> CL don't have strong foot in that area
[22:34:22] <jstoddard> Yeah, it would just be CAPI.
[22:34:47] <borodust> oh, you have lispworks license? that part is covered then
[22:34:49] <dthompson> in terms of total effort required, I definitely felt that it was much easier to just learn how to load tiled maps.
[22:35:10] <dthompson> with the downside being that I don't have a sweet in-game map editor written in lisp :(
[22:35:34] <borodust> btw, Shinmera might have some sort of an editor thing with Trial
[22:35:49] <borodust> not sure he has enough time to support anyone, but worth asking i guess
[22:42:00] <jstoddard> Thanks both of you. I'm looking over the tmx and json format docs now.
[22:50:16] <aeth> or use textures
[22:50:25] <aeth> not hard to load in a PNG that represents terrain
[22:50:49] <aeth> and another grayscale PNG that represents a heightmap, too, if you're 3D or pseudo-3D
[22:51:52] <drakonis> https://awkravchuk.itch.io/darkness-looming-the-dawn this is neat.
[22:52:31] <jstoddard> Just 2D tile-based for this game. Sticking with familiar terrain so I can get something done while learning modern stuff like OpenGL.
[22:53:38] <aeth> by pseudo-3D, I mean some element of "height", like in e.g. AoE II
[22:53:48] <aeth> really, that just means slope tiles
[22:54:04] <jstoddard> Tiled seems overwhelming mostly because it tries to be so flexible, but I like the idea of using a well-known format rather than just spinning my own.
[22:54:16] <drakonis> so i asked shinmera and there used to be one, but not anymore
[22:54:18] <aeth> tiled, to me, seems like overkill
[22:54:23] <aeth> vs just using PNGs
[22:54:28] <aeth> But apparently people like it...
[22:54:49] <drakonis> the reasoning behind the lack of one is that it is inherently incompatible with trial's architecture
[22:56:17] <borodust> i mean, Trial/Kandria has its own UI and editor
[22:57:46] <jstoddard> drakonis: What catches my eye about Darkness Looming: The Dawn is its use of Allegro. I used to use that library with DOS/DJGPP probably over twenty years ago.
[22:58:11] <drakonis> there's code that hasn't been extracted out of kandria's source into libraries
[22:58:12] <jstoddard> My programming has advanced since then, but not in the world of graphics.
[23:05:25] <drakonis> back to editors
[23:05:43] <drakonis> trial itself does not have an editor or map format, but kandria does because shinmera established one
[23:06:48] <drakonis> but he thinks the one he's using right now isnt the right approach yet
[23:08:13] <drakonis> but when he has something, it'll be available.
[23:14:08] <borodust> drakonis: thanks!
[23:14:12] <borodust> good to know
