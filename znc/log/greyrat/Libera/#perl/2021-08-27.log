[02:26:08] <vague> m4t, you shouldn't probably work with IO::Handle directly unless you have good reason, for example: my $fh = IO::File->new('notfound.txt') or die "Can't open: $!"; to get the error
[02:26:59] <ether> yeah, I would think the error is in $!

[02:27:40] <Grinnz> generally you check the return value to know whether there's been an error, not the error function
[02:27:44] <Grinnz> and then it's in $!
[02:29:26] <m4t> i'm was going to check it when IO::Select->can_write() is false but $! is not set
[02:30:14] <m4t> maybe $! will always be set then, if any of the handles being select()'d have errors?

[02:38:24] <vague> The pod said it checks the error bit(or similar), so only true/false. You want to use the EXCEPTION bit in ->select to check for errors if you go that way (from the quick read I gave it)

[21:08:54] <rbraun> for streaming/internet channels, probably time to connect, buffer, and yeah DRM bullshit
[21:09:33] <rbraun> for cable boxes, also takes "buffering" time to get the first keyframe, but worse if resolution changes (e.g. 720 -> 1080) since the HDMI connection has to be re-established. that also has a DRM factor (HDCP)
[21:10:12] <buZz> i have one of those '3 to 1 autohdmi switchers' , which strips HDCP it seems
[21:10:26] <buZz> also a 'HDMI capture USB stick' of ~15 usd strips it
