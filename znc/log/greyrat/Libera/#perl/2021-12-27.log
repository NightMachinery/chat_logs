[07:43:32] <aquanight> yes it's probably bad to spew MIDI to a terminal but this is what > and | is for
[07:48:43] <aquanight> haarg: unfortunately, the downside is the fact that it has to be overload::nil there means that any alternative system for setting up overloading (such as, say, an :operator attribute) still has to pull in overload.pm
[07:51:11] <haarg> if you are making a cpan module, you should be using overload.pm anyway, not messing with the symbol table
[07:51:57] <aquanight> haarg: I was thinking about how Cor could maybe offer an alternative and neater syntax for operator overloading. Unfortunately, see above.
[07:52:27] <haarg> loading overload.pm isn't really a problem
[07:52:40] <aquanight> well no it really isn't
[07:53:33] <aquanight> and it probably would be better to let overload handle the setup even if the import itself is sugar'd up. That way if someone ever overhauls overloading it only has to be done in one place.

[22:48:17] <Yaakov> She went to help out.
[22:48:42] <Yaakov> Big baby, 9 pounds.
[22:50:47] <Yaakov> I have been on a sysadmin marathon for the last few days rebuilding a bunch of personal infrastructure stuff. It had been a really long time since I was doing that sort of messy configuration stuff but I have to say, most things are more sane than in the past and tend to have less brittle configurations. So that's a good thing.

[22:55:15] <Yaakov> Well, this baby was FULL term. Born the day before the theoretical due date.
[22:55:32] <buu> Yaakov: Over the years I've certainly learned to actually configure things in a repeatable way because either it will fail immediately and you'll want to reboot it or it will wait 6 months to fail and you'll have absolutely no idea how to make it work again
[22:55:51] <buu> I actually really appreciate kubernetes for this
[22:56:09] <buu> It's a tad overkill but it does force you to think in repeatable ways
[22:57:26] <Yaakov> So, I had my household Debian server all nicely configured, and I was cheating some Let's Encrypt certs onto it when I made a really dumb mistake and wiped out /etc

[22:58:05] <Yaakov> And, it has real certs on it, which is nice.
[22:58:11] <ology> Damnation son!
[22:58:13] <buu> lets encrypt is super cool
[22:58:24] <Yaakov> Hellology.
[22:59:08] <buu> It's actually been a really long time since I've configured anything in /etc
[22:59:21] <buu> I don't think I would actually notice if I wiped out /etc on any of my machines these days
[22:59:46] <Yaakov> Yes, but of course they won't issue .local certs (not even "legal") so I have to use a real domain name, which is fine, but I have to use certbot on my cloud host then move them to the LAN-locked host.

[23:00:10] <Yaakov> It works fine but I want to automate it.
[23:01:11] <Yaakov> Well, the machine finds it challenging to do anything when /etc/ has only 3 symlinks to a non-existent directory in it.
[23:01:18] <El_Che> Yaakov: you don't have to run it on the cloud, e.g. if you validate them through DNS
[23:01:32] <El_Che> (what's required for wild card certs)

[23:02:30] <Yaakov> I have to use certbot to request/renew the certs, and the validation happens through Apache (or a standalone server) that has to be reachable on 80 or 443
[23:02:47] <El_Che> yes, hence I propose to use DNS
[23:03:03] <El_Che> I do that with certbot as well
[23:04:21] <Yaakov> Well, the wildcards are a newish thing. I hadn't used them.
[23:04:27] <Yaakov> I will have to look.
[23:04:48] <El_Che> you can use DNS for regular certs as well
[23:05:18] <El_Che> for home wildcard seems enough

[23:09:49] <Yaakov> unfortunately that won't work for me, I have multiple A records for the domain and they point at different addresses.
[23:09:55] <Yaakov> It would break things.
[23:09:59] <zgu> yeah if you do DNS verification the machine running certbot doesn't need to be able to accept HTTP connections
[23:10:19] <zgu> it just needs to communicate with whatever is hosting the DNS records
[23:10:32] <zgu> it doesn't use A records

[23:17:44] <zgu> hmm, that's apparently what i said almost 3 months ago too
[23:18:29] <Yaakov> Well, I have a working method that is not very hard, and nothing will stop working if I don't deal with it, it will just be ugly, so...
[23:19:36] <Yaakov> I finally fixed the cert on my Synology NAS. I had to forward port 80 to it for the request, which... I thought it previously did for itself with UPnP...
[23:19:54] <Yaakov> But it's renewed, so no more ugly mistrust.
[23:20:41] <Yaakov> I *was* going to use minica for certs in the house but Apple doesn't like certs with .local in them, so it causes trouble.
