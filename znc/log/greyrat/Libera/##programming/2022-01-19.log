[00:01:14] <Decker> something
[00:01:15] <mrig> not yet, that I am aware of, would like to make one :)

[00:01:48] <mrig> just need to get a scrip that can handle the language into a terminal first.
[00:02:02] <mrig> still working on that.

[00:02:41] <[itchyjunk]> wow, googling is so risky these days
[00:02:48] <[itchyjunk]> i wanted to know about the command "touch"
[00:02:56] <Decker> I have parsers how hard could it be? :) everything from mud-line based filters to token recognizers
[00:02:59] <[itchyjunk]> so i searched for man file
[00:03:15] <[itchyjunk]> but `man touch` has some "interesting results" as well
[00:03:20] <Decker> haha
[00:03:22] <[itchyjunk]> thankfull the first 2 is relavent
[00:03:27] <Decker> man handle
[00:04:02] <GeDaMo> man kill
[00:04:54] <[itchyjunk]> how do you say `create file a.txt and put this content in it` ?
[00:05:09] <[itchyjunk]> echo "a" | touch a.txt or echo "a" >> touch a.txt 
[00:05:12] <[itchyjunk]> doesn't work
[00:05:15] <mrig> man woman, dang no instructions :|
[00:05:30] <GeDaMo> [itchyjunk]: why would you need touch in that second one?
[00:05:37] <Decker> well undoubtedly manpage not found
[00:05:45] <[itchyjunk]> touch creates a file, no?
[00:05:45] <Decker> noone's got the instructions :)
[00:05:54] <mrig> updates the time on a file
[00:05:56] <Decker> it updates the timestamp
[00:05:56] <GeDaMo> echo "a" > text.txt
[00:06:01] <Decker> if the file doesn't exist it creates it
[00:06:20] <[itchyjunk]> but `eacho "a" > text.txt`
[00:06:21] <Decker> if the directory exists it updates the timestamp
[00:06:23] <[itchyjunk]> what's creating the file?
[00:06:30] <Decker> the shell
[00:06:34] <[itchyjunk]> hax
[00:06:38] <Decker> before launching echo with a pipe
[00:06:45] <GeDaMo> > writes stdout to a file, if it doesn't exist, it's created
[00:06:54] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[00:07:10] <GeDaMo> >> appends to a file
[00:07:19] <[itchyjunk]> interesting
[00:07:24] <[itchyjunk]> how do you make it work with | ?
[00:07:27] <GeDaMo> But it will also create a file which doesn't exist

[00:07:35] <[itchyjunk]> echo "a" | touch something something ?
[00:07:37] <Decker> you keep the pipe and create 2t proceses
[00:07:43] <GeDaMo> | pies from stdout of one program to stdin of another
[00:07:44] <Decker> with the pipe between them and no file
[00:07:47] <GeDaMo> Er, pipes
[00:08:03] <Decker> that pipe is created by the shell also
[00:08:10] <[itchyjunk]> >> appends to a file only? :o
[00:08:19] <Decker> as opposed to?
[00:08:20] <[itchyjunk]> cat a.txt >> someprogram would ruin the programm?
[00:08:31] <[itchyjunk]> it doesn't pipe the output to the program then?

[00:13:23] <Decker> even though it's built into the file handle

[00:14:07] <pyzozord> although I don't fully understand why is | and > different, isn't stream and file essentially the same thing?
[00:14:10] <apotheon> It's actually that >> append-redirects and > truncate-redirects.
[00:14:22] <Decker> essentially sure :)
[00:14:40] <Decker> one is a pipe to a process without a file - the other is a file handle that goes to a file
[00:14:49] <apotheon> If there's nothing there, they append to an empty (new) file or truncate an empty (new) file.
[00:14:51] <Decker> though really you shouldn't seek on that file
[00:15:03] <Decker> so it's handled much more like a pipe that dumps into a file

[00:19:55] <apotheon> people who've used tee, I guess

[00:20:59] <Decker> yup
[00:21:14] <KillerWasp> apotheon: bash follows the POSIX rules, so it is also standard.
[00:21:17] <Decker> that's why it's a T
[00:21:20] <[itchyjunk]> well guess i didn't learn shit, in that case
[00:21:30] <[itchyjunk]> oh that's what it means?

[00:21:34] <apotheon> KillerWasp: Bash is a lot more than POSIX rules, and it doesn't *enforce* POSIX rules, and sometimes it gets POSIX rules wrong.

[02:23:36] <PlanckWalk> RISC is a slightly compressed format from just raw micro-ops.  CISC is a heavily compressed one.
[02:25:04] <flakland> arm has that thumb mode, but i'm not sure what the limitations are
[02:25:09] <PlanckWalk> RISC inherently gets less density just from that.

[02:27:04] <PlanckWalk> Good is in the eye of the beholder

[02:30:49] <PlanckWalk> Actually, micro-ops isn't even the concept I meant
[02:31:07] <oldlaptop> Originally, the RISC style allowed the hardware design to be simplified. (It still allows it to be less un-simple in some ways)
[02:31:22] <PlanckWalk> I meant more like raw gate control bits
[02:31:22] <oldlaptop> One thing this did was make pipelining easier to implement, I suppose.
[02:31:39] <oldlaptop> PlanckWalk: Yeah.
[02:31:41] <PlanckWalk> Micro-ops decode into sets of gate control bits.
[02:31:43] <flakland> we could invent a new architecture where the program loads an instruction palette
[02:31:58] <oldlaptop> The whole decode unit could be combinational logic.

[02:49:20] <PlanckWalk> The difference between mathematical "never" and practical "never"

[02:49:47] <mikrosis> PlanckWalk: hmm, is it possible to find out after how many cycles a given regexp would end?
[02:50:14] <mikrosis> so one can have a policy, e.g. so many milliseconds or cycles for a given user
[02:50:36] <PlanckWalk> You can get an upper bound, but it might not be a useful one
[02:51:00] <PlanckWalk> You can assign quotas of run time regardless
[02:51:22] <mikrosis> so ReDoS is rather an implementation issue, not enough safeguards like a timeout (and async regexp execution) were added

[06:54:08] <PlanckWalk> I think the answer to the question really depends upon the conditions of how the input is supplied, how the output is provided, and other details
[06:54:49] <|smlckz|> inhahe_ got an interesting answer, for my int, i'd need 2^32 words [ heinously wasteful ] so, sounds theoretically possible.. but no, i need at most floor(log2(n))+1 bits to store the frequency count for each value..
[06:55:27] <inhahe_> yeah
[06:55:30] <PlanckWalk> If you need to store the output data ten you'll need at least O(n) space
[06:55:53] <PlanckWalk> If you can provide it as a stream then you can get away with a lot less
[06:56:15] <inhahe_> it's a frequency counter, he only needs 2^32 space to store output data
[06:56:35] <|smlckz|> *only*
[06:56:36] <inhahe_> oh, you said at least
[06:56:40] <inhahe_> yeah that makes sense
[06:56:41] <PlanckWalk> E.g. suppose the input is a rewindable stream and the output is a stream of (element, count) pairs.
[06:57:38] <inhahe_> why does it have to be rewindable?
[06:57:43] *** Joins: lunix00 (~lunix00@2804:14c:6321:900d:c0b2:a7ad:8aa7:4387)
[06:58:07] <PlanckWalk> You could then read through the input once for each possible element value.
[06:58:18] <PlanckWalk> If there are any, output the element and count.
[06:58:27] <|smlckz|> in my case, i take n from user, then n ints into an array, then i need to print the frequency count.. [writing in C]
[06:59:20] <inhahe_> you could iterate over the output every time to see what you can consolodate instead of iterating over the input
[06:59:26] <inhahe_> multiple times
[06:59:37] <PlanckWalk> So in that case you only need O(log n) space.

[07:00:18] <PlanckWalk> Err, your number of bits needed for the count might go up to log n
[07:01:41] <PlanckWalk> So it actually is pretty close to that, except it's a random-access input and stream output.
[07:02:24] <|smlckz|> But how can i have unique output for each value, so that a value repeated in array does not correspond to repeat in output?
[07:02:46] <PlanckWalk> I guess that since this is C, the number of elements is bounded by a constant

[07:27:23] <InPhase> |smlckz|: For one example, take a list of non-negative integers, stored in a signed integer type.  First sort them.  Then iterate through, and if there is only one instance of a number, that number stays there in the final pass.  If there are two or more numbers, you replace them in sequence with the negative of the count of how many there are, followed by the number that's repeated.  Then continue 
[07:27:29] <InPhase> on down the line.  Use some sentinal value like the most-negative integer to terminate the sequence if it does not extend to the length of the input.  Your output will be a frequency count stored in the original input vector's space, and taking up the same or less space.
[07:28:02] <InPhase> -1 could also be your sentinal value, since that will never appear in the algorithm.

[07:34:55] <InPhase> |smlckz|: This algorithm cheats slightly by the original constraint requiring that the input values not occupy all of their space, leaving that one bit to utilize.  But that's an example of how little it can take to guarantee the count will fit for any input.  Perhaps there are some cleverer approaches that are more compact.  For example, you can probably do better if you can guarantee there are a 
[07:35:01] <InPhase> certain small number of repeats (I think 2 is sufficient) and after you sort the values you process them in descending order of frequency.  Then you can skip the thing about the negatives, and simply stop processing the repeat marker when you get to a frequency of 1 or 0.

[15:30:24] <tomathy> well it makes sense

[16:30:35] <InPhase> inhahe_: It doesn't seem so as a primary mechanism, but the brain's learning has broader goals than a typical machine learning neural network.  Our code for neural networks is usually focused on a single problem with a single reward.  But the brain must remember all sorts of context that leads to both positive and negative outcomes along with situational information.

[21:03:13] <deniska> InPhase: if a script has no loops or if statements, bash is fine I guess
[21:03:15] <InPhase> Bash is for small simple things, but there are a lot more small simple things needing done than large things, with one of those 80/20 type curves.
[21:03:22] <Trashlord> for example one time I wrote a small script to automatically mass-rename files in several folders, but I did it in Python, not bash
[21:03:25] <pulse> it's the easiest solution when you want to automate a common terminal task
[21:03:31] <pulse> which is fine
[21:03:38] <pulse> 3-5 lines of bash is... acceptable, if you squint a little
[21:03:39] <InPhase> deniska: I wouldn't go that far.  Looping over lists of files and such is a core strength of bash.
