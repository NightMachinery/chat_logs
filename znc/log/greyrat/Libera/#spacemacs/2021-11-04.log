[01:54:55] <Codaraxis> I'm using Evil and accidentally started typing in normal mode instead of insert mode. I have no idea what I turned on, but the super star word search functionality is engaging automatically on whatever word I place the point. It's also persisting through restarts. I don't suppose someone could tell me what this is and how to turn it off?

[01:56:10] <Codaraxis> @drpastah The behaviour persists even when I toggle Evil on and off

Although Doom has some nice features, I generally prefer Spacemacs's choices, like providing `evilified-state`, the major-mode leader key, `M-x` under `SPC SPC`, scratch buffer under `SPC b s` and having all kinds of configuration variables right within a single dotfile (and no extra utilities on the command line). 
[16:46:59] <FromGitter> ... Doom's way also has some advantages of course, but for me these advantages add very little, while on the other hand you miss out on a lot.
