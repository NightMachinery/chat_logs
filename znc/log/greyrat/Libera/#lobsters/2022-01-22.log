[00:08:48] <feoh> Javascript's bid to swallow the world in one giant gulp is succeeding.
[00:09:06] <bkhl> feoh, well, not exactly Javascript, it's some (relatively) sensible JS derivative.
[00:09:27] <feoh> OK but it's not Scheme :)
[00:09:42] <feoh> Therefore !!!!
[00:09:44] <bparker> also there's no current solution for *very-quickly* booting up an embedded device running on JS, whereas there is an entire "Boot to Qt" framework designed just for that

[00:10:33] <bkhl> bparker, you don't actually need to convince me of avoiding JavaScript. :-)
[00:11:21] <bkhl> So seems that they are using a subset of Javascript as a dedicated teaching language.
[00:11:37] <bparker> who is
[00:11:42] <bkhl> And I do like the idea of using dedicated teaching languages to push people away from the idea that they should be learning specific technologies in university.
[00:11:43] <bkhl> SICP.
[00:11:45] <bparker> ah
[00:12:04] <feoh> bkhl: Looks like it's JS but just with their library:
[00:12:04] <feoh> ---
[00:12:04] <feoh> The JavaScript programs included in the book run in any implementation of the language that complies with the ECMAScript 2020 specification, using the JavaScript package SICP provided on the MIT Press website.
[00:12:17] <pe> Woo, modern.
[00:12:48] <feoh> I can't decide whether I think this is a 'woo' moment or not :) I know a lot of people got exposed to Scheme/LISP through SICP
[00:13:02] <pe> I remember older version of Javascript.

[00:13:40] <feoh> But a lot of people also ended up NOT feeling the love and hating all LISP like things as a result of being forced. So ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[16:10:51] <iDrougge> I've run Linux on a 386DX. That's the machine it was developed for, what's so interesting about it?
[16:13:30] <Ticho> it's just innocent nostalgia-fueled fun - something like people running windows 3.11 in VMs
[16:18:36] <iDrougge> I'm interested in old computers and systems because they let me find out new things and evolutionary paths, not just what we have today.
[16:18:54] <iDrougge> Windows and Linux are everywhere.
[16:21:09] <albertito> iDrougge: that's okay, but other people enjoy nostalgia, learning from the past, or just have fun running old things, let them be
[16:22:06] <albertito> also, it's running a modern kernel (5.14.8)
[16:23:31] <Ticho> didn't linux drop support for i386 not long ago? it probably wouldn't work on the mentioned 386DX :)
[16:23:52] <bsandro> 20 mb ram huh, fancy
[16:23:54] <iDrougge> 🤷‍♂️
[16:24:23] <iDrougge> I ran Slackware 3 or something. X11 didn't really work.
[16:24:37] <albertito> Ticho: the post says 486sx is the oldest supported by a current kernel
[16:24:45] <Ticho> that tracks, thanks
[16:24:46] <bsandro> got 386sx with 4mb ram laptop, running anything modern there is quite tricky
[16:25:37] <Ticho> I ran gentoo on a pentium with 48MB ram for years, that was quite an excercise in patience

[19:09:11] <ngoldbaum> lol i love the answers for “compensation” in that thread
[19:09:19] <ngoldbaum> most of the answers amount to “money”

[19:12:48] <pushcx> Yeah, not great. I might add a nudge to avoid useless non-answers next time.
[19:15:39] <kline> Compensation: Depends on position and location.
[19:15:39] <kline> Contact: Please go through the pages dedicated to the positions that interest you :)
[19:15:52] <kline> so its just an advert to look at their job site
[19:15:58] <kline> nothing lobstery :(
[19:16:23] <pushcx> ha-ha-only-serious prompt: If you can't give a numeric range for salary and equity, your answer must be the phrase "So low we can't publish it."
[19:17:12] <epilys[m]> please.
[19:17:25] <epilys[m]> fix this if you can, it's enraging

[19:18:53] <ignaloidas> iDrougge, funnily enough my last two jobs were entirely from linkedin
[19:19:45] <ignaloidas> though my github is barren, so not exactly a huge draw for reqruiters
[19:21:37] <albertito> looking at the listings there, some seem to read the template as "indicate if you offer salary, equity, etc" in a checkboxy way, rather than "say a range for salary and equity you provide"
[19:21:38] *** Joins: echoSMILE (uid504326@user/echosmile)
[19:25:10] <ignaloidas> salary: no, equity: yes is basically equivalent to "for exposure!"
[19:31:14] <pushcx> tinkered with a lot of things, here's a draft for kibitzing: https://gist.github.com/pushcx/5203bee4c35e7f3941e822c79dabf414
[19:31:14] <mockturtle> [ draft for next quarterly job posting ] - gist.github.com
[19:32:34] <pushcx> albertito: I think they're probably all posts by devs who don't know the ranges for the positions. Requiring a numeric range puts them on the spot if they're in a compartmentalized org but... well, the point of it is they should know those numbers.
[19:33:42] <albertito> pushcx: I totally agree; +1 for the new wording that clarifies it's a requirement
[19:39:14] <pushcx> I deliberately didn't make it one last time, I was curious how it'd go. Added nothing, really, because the posters are uninformed themselves.
